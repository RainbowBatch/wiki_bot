1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,960
Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does

2
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:21,200
he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.

3
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:31,840
It's Friday, January 18th, 2013. It's the Alex Jones Show. I'm Paul Joseph Watson, writer

4
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:37,880
with Infowars.com, filling in for Alex today. And the second half of the show will be presented

5
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:44,120
by the health ranger, Mike Adams. He'll be joined by Representative Steve Toth to talk

6
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:50,520
about the latest with the gun grab news, as well as Dr. Andrew Wakefield, who of course

7
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:56,840
has been vilified for revealing the dangers of vaccines. And coming up shortly, CNN can't

8
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:02,720
get him, but we can. It's the controversial Florida professor who's basically been savaged

9
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:08,060
by the mainstream media for questioning the official narrative behind the Sandy Hook shooting.

10
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:14,960
It's Professor James Tracy, and he'll be live via Skype to take your calls. And of course,

11
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:20,060
if you've been living under a rock for the past few weeks, then the internet is basically

12
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:25,680
aflame with what they're calling Sandy Hook truthers. And there's actually one YouTube

13
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:34,680
video alone which has got over 10.6 million views in the last 10 days alone that talks

14
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:40,520
about some of these questions surrounding the Sandy Hook massacre. So basically, he's

15
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:58,640
been absolutely pillared by the mainstream media. I'm sorry, sorry about that. He's been

16
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:05,440
absolutely pillared by the mainstream media. He was on CNN's Anderson Cooper 360 last Friday,

17
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:11,800
I believe it was. And for 25 minutes, Anderson Cooper attacked him, put his picture up on

18
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:17,800
screen. Basically, it was a surprise that there wasn't a wanted sign next to his name.

19
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:23,000
I don't actually believe in all these theories that are circulating about Sandy Hook, but

20
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,320
we're going to talk to the professor before the bottom of the hour. We're going to go

21
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:32,920
over some of the questions that he and others have raised about the Sandy Hook massacre

22
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:39,480
and about the backlash that he's faced from the likes of CNN, from the likes of Fox News.

23
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:44,040
So that's going to be a fascinating talk. We're also going to go to your calls at the

24
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:51,040
top of the hour for Professor James Tracy on all things Sandy Hook. But the top news

25
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:57,080
at the moment on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com, we've heard about the Nerf gun. We've heard

26
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:03,000
about the kid, you know, being suspended for making a gun sign with his hand. But this

27
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,360
one really takes the biscuit. And this took place in Mount Armel, Florida. This is a story

28
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:14,680
just out today. Basically, a five year old girl, a kindergarten girl, had a toy pink

29
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:19,840
gun. It was a Hello Kitty toy pink gun that blew bubbles out of the gun when you pulled

30
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:26,000
the trigger. It's a toy gun for a kindergarten child. She joked with her classmates that

31
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,960
she was going to shoot them with her toy pink bubble gun. And of course, the teacher later

32
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:38,020
finds out in this school in Florida, the five year old girl is interrogated without her

33
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:46,640
mother being present for three hours by school officials over a Hello Kitty pink toy bubble

34
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:54,600
gun. And it gets worse. The girl told her mother that school officials actually threatened

35
00:03:54,600 --> 00:04:02,160
her with jail time. This is a five year old girl, jail time for making jokes about shooting

36
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:08,400
people with a pink bubble gun. And she was actually suspended. This five year old child

37
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:15,440
was suspended from kindergarten. And get this, school officials as well in this story said

38
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:23,460
that she was making terroristic threats, terroristic threats with the toy pink bubble gun, the

39
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:29,840
Hello Kitty gun. So I mean, this again, just heaps on top of the craziness in the aftermath

40
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:36,520
of Sandy Hook. Is it really any wonder that the number of home school kids in America

41
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:42,780
has swelled by over a million kids in the last decade when we continue to hear stories

42
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:47,760
like this? I mean, you know, talk about the United States of hysteria. This is a five

43
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:54,500
year old girl interrogated for three hours, accused of making terroristic threats, threatened

44
00:04:54,500 --> 00:05:02,560
with jail and suspended for a Hello Kitty toy bubble gun. The new year is a great time

45
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:09,320

at the surface. But rather, we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin nourishing

71

74
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:17,240
run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network. We're back on the Alex Jones Show. Coming

75
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:22,300
up we've got the fact that James Tracy just talked about the Sandy Hook controversy. But

76
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:27,640
now we're joined on the line by Alex Jones with an emergency alert for gun owners. Alex,

77
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:34,080
welcome to the show. That's right. I've taken a day off to take my son camping and I got

78
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:39,920
up this morning and began reading the articles at infoawards.com and I had to call in here

79
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:46,160
to point out that even infoawards.com and even myself and my great researchers, we tend

80
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:53,560
to under or downplay the full magnitude of this. What's happening is so tyrannical and

81
00:08:53,560 --> 00:09:00,640
so sensational in how over the top it is. The globalists have a good chance of actually

82
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:05,400
getting most of our guns if we don't completely wake up. What am I talking about? There are

83
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:11,520
two key articles right now on infoawards.com. What about Big Sis to use the see something

84
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:17,640
say something? Homeland Security spy grid on gun owners. The other, and I saw other

85
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:22,920
articles yesterday about police drills federally funded to take on disgruntled veterans and

86
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:27,280
gun owners. Now regular listeners know this is nothing new. The New York Times four years

87
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:31,600
ago, three years ago, scouts trained to take on terrorists and more. They trained to take

88
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,720
guns and kill veterans. The Homeland Security documents say returning veterans are the number

89
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:42,120
one enemy. Gun owners, conservatives, libertarians, constitutionalists, bonballs in the fetters.

90
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:47,400
We've known this was behind the scenes in the documents for at least the last four years.

91
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:52,280
It was going on before that, but it accelerated under Obama. Now I've had a chance yesterday

92
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:58,120
and last time this morning to read the executive orders to really drill into it and it confirms

93
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:03,080
everything they tried to push before all at once, hitting us from over a hundred angles.

94
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:09,240
33 executive orders, a bunch of legislation, a bunch of other actions. They are creating,

95
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:14,560
well they've created the giant Stasi spy force in the name of fighting Al Qaeda. Now they

96
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,920
say, don't worry about Al Qaeda. They're actually good guys. Our government's using them in

97
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,920
Libya and Syria. That's in the news and they're flipping the whole thing. Now people remember

98
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:27,240
articles we wrote years ago saying why Al Qaeda will be announced because we got the

99
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:33,040
new training manuals and we saw the new training videos where every terrorist is a white person

100
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:38,400
being, quote, reported by a minority. And now the initial scripts are out on four new

101
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:45,200
TV shows, Founding Fathers and others, where it's all white, racist with guns and minorities

102
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:50,960
taking them down. So it's a government organized attempt to push a kind of race war type deal

103
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:55,040
where it's the minorities in the government teamed up against, quote, whites. And that's

104
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:00,920
why you see them on Fox Sports saying all gun owners are racist Klan members. That's

105
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:07,040
why you see Bob Schaefer on CBS saying we've got to have a World War II operation against

106
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,000
gun owners like they're Hitler. Folks, you heard the clip. That's why you're hearing

107
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,680
that we murdered the children in Sandy Hook. This is a purge of libertarians and conservatives.

108
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:22,200
I'm not saying this for effect. The evidence is incontrovertible. It is an over the top

109
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:27,000
situation. They are definitely going to stage false flags and come after us. I already knew

110
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,560
this was happening last year when four TV shows were in development all green lighted

111
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:38,280
down to start airing this year where gun owners are racist murderers. So they're now going

112
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:42,120
to say gun owning is a white thing. And people say, well, that doesn't make any sense. They

113
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:47,960
don't care. This is how communists have taken down other countries. And the banks are using

114
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:52,260
the communist playbook. It doesn't mean they're communists. They use communism at the grassroots

115
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:57,680
with fascism on top of it. So I saw Steve Watson's article. I saw Kurt Nemo's article.

116
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:05,120
I saw him. And they're good articles, but they don't explain. Folks, it's now happening.

117
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:10,360
Everything we warned about. Everything we talked about. Now it's not going to be the

118
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:15,560
TSA is going to be on the highways to stop Al-Qaeda. It's now going to be, and it's

119
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:19,360
already started, gun checkpoints. It's going to be harassment of gun owners. It's going

120
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:24,600
to be saying we're mentally ill. They're already doing this. They already now have new gun

121
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,680
questionnaires coming out at the state levels that say, are you a conspiracy theorist? Do

122
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:32,760
you believe in a new world order? You can't have a gun. And if conservatives get into

123
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:37,120
this and go, well, I better just shut up or it'll take my guns, now they have the chilling

124
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:42,040
effect. This is what authoritarians have always done. Notice the world government's not denied

125
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:46,400
now. It's admitted. And they're saying you're a terrorist if you don't accept it. The mainstream

126
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:52,520
media, the government, all of it is an occupying force. We still have talk radio. We still

127
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:58,440
have a lot of the states. People are fighting back. But Paul, it is so over the top. So

128
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:03,920
over the top. And I'm standing on top of Mesa. I hope I'm coming through to you clearly.

129
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,920
I'm up here hiking. Can you hear me, Paul? Yeah. Loud and clear. Okay, good. I climbed

130
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:12,280
on top of a mountain, literally a small mountain. It's like a pretty good cell range. There's

131
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:17,040
no cell out here where I'm going to have to hike in with my family. So this is what it

132
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:23,480
comes down to, ladies and gentlemen, is that we are in deep, deep, deep, deep, deep emergency

133
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:28,200
trouble. Everything we've talked about is coming true. I'm not happy about that. I'm

134
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:32,120
not happy now that people all over the country are saying Alex Jones is the leader of the

135
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:36,720
resistance, Alex Jones, this and that. But I am happy that we at least got the word out

136
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,440
beforehand until we got a chance to beat these people. But I'm not happy it got this far.

137
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,600
This is not fun. This is real, folks. This is real. And a mainline conservative talk

138
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:52,200
show host won't realize how much trouble we're in and get hardcore now. It's over. Notice

139
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:56,120
they preconditioned us before all this happened. There's no world government. Nobody wants

140
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:00,240
your guns. The Federal Reserve isn't private. None of this is going to happen. There won't

141
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:05,960
be any carbon taxes. And now they're just doing it all. It is now all happening in mass.

142
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:10,680
I'm going to let you get back to the broadcast. The good news is, as you pointed out, there's

143
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:15,840
more than 30 million views, 10 million on one video alone on YouTube, about Sandy Hook

144
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:20,080
hoaxes. I haven't even gotten into the hoax. I think it smells to high heaven. I don't

145
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,880
know how deep it goes. I know they staged the Batman thing. Even Larry Pratt says it

146
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:29,520
has evidence of that. We know they staged Fast and Furious. They could stage anything.

147
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:33,080
Put nothing past them. But the fact that, and that's conservative when I say 30 million

148
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:37,840
views, one video's got like 11 million, one's got 10 million. I mean, in fact, the only

149
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:41,480
time I lie is I underestimate because I don't want to say the truth. There's like 100 million

150
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:46,840
views from what I've seen. Okay, I said 30, that was wrong. Okay, it's like 100 million

151
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:52,920
views of people saying they don't buy Sandy Hook. The media is panicking. No one believes

152
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:57,560
them anymore. That's why they're moving. They're not trying to take over because they're strong.

153
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:01,400
They're trying to take over because they are weak. They're trying to take over because

154
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:07,880
they know the people are waking up. So black, white, Hispanic, old, young, north, south,

155
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:12,920
east, west, we have been taken over. Obama got the taxes raised on poor people. Obama

156
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:17,280
promised not to come after the guns. Obama promised all this stuff. The Republicans are

157
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:20,960
going to go along with total open borders to gut the country. Everything's about to

158
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:25,760
happen this year. That's why they're trying to mobilize their minions and dumb down soccer

159
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:31,560
moms to go after our guns. We have to get back in their face and say, how dare you compare

160
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:35,560
gun owners to Nazi Germany and the government has to have a war against them. How dare you

161
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:40,960
call us Klan? How dare you say we're criminals? How dare you say we killed those kids? How

162
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:44,640
dare you try to put that guilt on us? They are branding us. Here's the key. I'm going

163
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:50,520
to get off. We are being branded as the terrorists right now. We are being branded. We are being

164
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:57,400
branded. The secret program that I discovered years ago that we forced out to go public

165
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:03,160
from our law enforcement sources that are patriots is now going public. They are going

166
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:08,440
ahead with saying gun owners and conservatives are terrorists and that we're not going to

167
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:14,160
be able to own guns. This is a Soviet-style purge like the Reds did to the White Russians

168
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:20,400
in 1917. Ladies and gentlemen, they are declaring a concerted homeland security program of harassment

169
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:27,520
and intimidation against gun owners. Obama must be impeached now. He is an absolute criminal

170
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,680
and you must call every member of Congress and let them know that you're fully aware

171
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:34,960
of what's happening because they know they've all committed crimes and insider trading.

172
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:38,300
They know that they're bringing the country down. They know they're imploding the derivatives.

173
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:42,080
They know they brought in the new world order. They know they've done all of this and so

174
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:46,320
they want to lock us up the opposition to their criminal activities. They want to say

175
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,520
that real Americans know what's happening are terrorists. This is so outrageous. We

176
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:58,000
have to use their leap, their power grab to boomerang back on them. They are going for

177
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,000
everything right now. They have overreached. But if we don't respond, they are going to

178
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,320
win. I'm telling you folks, they're going to come and arrest you. They're going to take

179
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:11,440
your property. Even if you've never fought for liberty and you've got property or a business

180
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:17,200
owner, they're going to take everything you've got. They want a hot, quick takeover of America.

181
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:21,880
Look how much has happened. The Obamacare, the bankruptcy, the NAFTA, the gap, the Chinese

182
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:26,640
owning our debt, the Chinese government saying they want our guns turned in a month ago,

183
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:33,760
the UN treaty, the UN running our military. You ain't seen nothing, nothing, nothing yet.

184
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:38,640
We are being declared terrorists on television right now. They are saying gun owners are

185
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:44,400
the Nazis like of World War II and the government can take us out. This is outrageous. They

186
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:50,400
are now branding us as terrorists worldwide. We are being branded to be hunted down and

187
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,520
arrested. Paul Watson, the magnitude of this is literally off the charts. What do you say?

188
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:00,200
Well, it's downright creepy, isn't it? Because everybody's been asking, well, if they get

189
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,560
the assault weapons ban through, how are they going to enforce it? How are they going to

190
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:11,080
confiscate these weapons? And big sis, DHS has announced that they're going to help expand

191
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:17,680
and prioritize the see something, say something campaign with the express purpose of aiding

192
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:22,480
Obama's gun control. So what does that mean? It was always set up for that. I'm going to

193
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,880
get off and let you continue with the article. We need to repost Kurt Nemo's article where

194
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:29,600
the bill is introduced where they make you turn your guns in and then you get a tax credit

195
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:35,600
for it on your taxes. Folks, it's happening. She's announcing that we're the terrorists.

196
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:40,280
In the training videos, every single person is white. I mean, folks, it is on. All you

197
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:45,400
guys that said give our liberties up because of Al Qaeda, you have been fooled. Just like

198
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,840
the Obama suckers that thought he was going to cut their taxes. Paul, go over all the

199
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:54,240
articles. Everybody, get them at infoawards.com, prisonplanet.com, get them out to everybody.

200
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:59,160
Ladies and gentlemen, this is it. And they are going to butcher everything else. They're

201
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:02,560
going to take the pension funds. They're going to gut everything. Paul Watson, big show coming

202
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,920
up today with you and Mike Adams is going to sit in for half the show coming up. God

203
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:10,200
bless you all. Ladies and gentlemen, this is it. Toe to toe with the new world order.

204
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:14,440
God bless you. There goes Alex Jones. And I mean, this is

205
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:20,800
an agency of the DHS. Let's not forget that put out a report last year, funded a report

206
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:27,020
that said Americans quote, reverential of liberty and Americans suspicious of centralized

207
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:32,920
authority were basically terrorists. They lumped them in with a bunch of hate groups,

208
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:39,560
racist clan members and terrorist organizations and said that Americans who held those viewpoints

209
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:44,080
were in the same league. I mean, this is an agency that's put out PSAs for the past three

210
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:50,840
or four years, whereas Alex said every terrorist portrayed as white middle class American.

211
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,800
That's who they're targeting. And we'll be back after the break with Professor James

212
00:19:54,800 --> 00:20:03,080
Tracy. Stay tuned. Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how

213
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:07,680
did we ever survive from natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer

214
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:12,600
drought to the family hardships brought on by a disastrous economy? Our hearts go out

215
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:17,120
to those that have lost everything at e foods direct. We hear from customers every day that

216
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:21,800
are fortunate enough to weather life storm by having a supply of food on hand after Hurricane

217
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:27,240
Sandy. Danny from New York City wrote almost all the grocery stores are closed, but I managed

218
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:32,280
to get my e foods just in time to be able to help my sister and niece. It is better

219
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:37,020
to be prepared 10 years too early than one day too late. I can warn you, but I can't

224
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,760
by the electric environment. Hi, I'm Pastor Jenny and that was the state I was in back

225
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:14,420
in 2010. Then I learned about RNA drops. I learned that 97% of my DNA that scientists

226
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:19,360
have called junk is actually packed with millions of gene switches that play a critical role

227
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:24,280
in controlling how my cells, organs and other tissues behave. I learned I don't have to

228
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:28,220
put up with disease decay or decline like I've been conditioned to believe. I began

229
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:34,200
taking RNA drops, a 100% natural formula designed to turn on those switches and provide me with

230

Only this offer ends January 31st. Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered why

239
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:35,400
banks, stock workers, investment advisors want to talk about gold IRAs? They've been

240
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:40,240
available since 1986 yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your

241
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:45,060
retirement. Gold is outperformed paper investments yet no word about IRAs. If you would like

242
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:51,400
to have gold for your retirement call 800-686-2237. Don't get left behind by rising inflation

243
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:59,480
and low returns call 800-686-2237. Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237. It's

244
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:04,880
time for a home security quiz. Answer this. What effective home security device is smaller

245
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,920
than a coffee cup, fakes out burglars into thinking someone is home at your house while

246
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:13,720
you're away, plugs into any wall outlet, is recommended by many police departments and

247
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:20,780
sells for less than $35? Yes, it's fake TV. This year about one in every 50 US homes will

248
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:26,020
have a break in with burglars usually picking the easy target, a dark house that looks like

249
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:31,160
no one is home. Fake TV is a small electronic security device that makes it look like someone

250
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:36,600
is home watching TV by simulating the light from a real TV. It's like a lamp on a timer

251
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:42,100
but far more convincing. And for only $34.95, fake TV could be the difference between coming

252
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:50,480
home to a secure house or one that's been ransacked. Go to faketv.com or call 1-877-5FAKETV.

253
00:23:50,480 --> 00:24:01,880
That's 877-532-5388 or go to faketv.com. Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.

254
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:18,960
Back on the Alex Jones Show, Paul Joseph Watson filling in for Alex Jones, Mike Adams coming

255
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,920
up in the second half of the show. Top story on Drudge Report right now. TSA to remove

256
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:28,920
controversial X-ray scanners. This is out of the Associated Press. Transportation Security

257
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:33,160
Administration confirms that it is getting rid of airport body scanners that produce

258
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:38,680
a naked image of travelers. So that's kind of a partial victory. Of course, they're still

259
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:45,460
going to use the ones that quote unzip your DNA but apparently now completely phasing

260
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:50,600
out the X-ray body scanners, of course, as a result of numerous controversies over the

261
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:57,320
past several years, led in no small part by drudgereport.com and infowars.com. So that

262
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:01,800
is a victory on that front. Of course, before the break, you heard Alex. He was talking

263
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:08,520
about this new report out of Portsmouth, Ohio, which is up on infowars.com. Drill characterizes

264
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:15,540
disgruntled Second Amendment advocates as terrorists. Basically, they had a safety security

265
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:21,400
exercise involving the police, National Guard and local emergency responders there in Portsmouth,

266
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:27,820
Ohio. And the terrorists in this drill were portrayed as quote, two school employees who

267
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:34,480
are disgruntled over the government's interpretation of the Second Amendment. And in this scenario,

268
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:42,480
they had these pro-gun rights people building weapons of mass destruction, killing teachers

269
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:48,560
and using biological agents against the local community. So they're basically going full

270
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:56,320
lockstep now demonizing Second Amendment advocates amidst this national debate on gun control.

271
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:02,980
So that story is up right now at infowars.com. I'm delighted to be joined now by Professor

272
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:10,220
James Tracy, Ph.D. from Florida Atlantic University. He's a tenured communications professor and

273
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:16,440
he also teaches a class entitled Culture of Conspiracy. He's also involved with Project

274
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:22,680
Censored and his website is memorywholeblog.com. Professor, welcome to the show.

275
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:28,840
It's great to be here Paul. Thank you. Now, before we get into Sandy Hook, obviously

276
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:33,680
we're going to go in detail on that. I want to talk about basically the onslaught you've

277
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:39,160
received over the past week by the mainstream media and particularly CNN. As I mentioned

278
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:45,180
earlier, Anderson Cooper literally devoted half of his show last week to attacking Professor

279
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:50,620
Tracy. And then he had another ten minute segment just a couple of days ago doing the

280
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:56,800
same thing. Basically, as far as I saw it, he was trying to get Professor Tracy fired

281
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:03,120
from his position there at the university. So, Professor, CNN could have easily just

282
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:07,920
ignored all this. Why do you think they've attacked you so vigorously for asking questions

283
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:12,560
about Sandy Hook? I think basically to bring me into the news

284
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:17,580
frame and to personalize this between myself and the families of Newtown, it has nothing

285
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:21,400
to do with that. I was bringing up questions that were not raised, that were not addressed

286
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:25,400
by the media. Anderson Cooper is someone who says he's keeping them honest. Well, who's

287
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:29,480
he keeping honest? The poor parents about their grief, or is he keeping people honest,

288
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:33,280
the authorities and so forth there, that have dropped the ball with regard to the investigation

289
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:41,040
or perhaps even covered something up. They contacted me last Friday. I was frankly somewhat

290
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:48,080
exhausted from the entire week after the story went viral. Drudge picked it up on Tuesday.

291
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:53,380
And I spoke with my family members and my wife, and she didn't really want me to go

292
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:59,800
on the show. And so I declined from doing so, and they were very persistent. They in

293
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:05,080
fact actually sent their reporter out here who went to my place of employment, then filmed

294
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:09,960
out in my front lawn pretty much. I was not even aware of that, but he did call and say

295
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:15,100
that he was around the corner. He was a couple blocks away, I guess, wanted me to come out.

296
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:21,520
And I said, look, I'm really not into it. I'm tired. I will consider it in the future.

297
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:26,360
I will provide a statement to you. I provided an email statement. It took me an hour or

298
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:31,280
so to compose. They used a snippet of it or two on the air, and that was it. But other

299
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:38,720
than that, it was really an attack. I was really rather taken aback by the extent of

300
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:44,880
it. They contacted me again earlier this week, and on Monday I said, well, I will consider

301
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:50,120
it on Tuesday. They said, well, it's time. Do you want to go ahead and do it? And they

302
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:54,360
wanted to get me down to the studio right away. And I said, I've got to teach this evening.

303
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:59,100
I really don't have the time, but I will consider doing it. I've contacted them again and they've

304
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:05,440
not responded. So you're perfectly willing to go on there. You've contacted them and

305
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:10,920
now they've basically stopped talking to you. Is that the case? That's the case. Yes. So

306
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:15,440
maybe, you know, maybe they've dropped the story. I mean, to my, I watched the clip,

307
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:20,880
the 20 minute thing where Cooper's demonizing you. And it seems obviously he's using, you

308
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,880
know, you're insulting the victims as his platform for what he's saying. But he also

309
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:30,240
seemed just as annoyed about the fact that you were questioning whether or not the mainstream

310
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,320
media did its job in the first days after the event. So we'll go more into that. We'll

342
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:29,260
James Tracy about the Sandy Hook massacre. He's a professor who's caused no end of controversy over

343
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:36,700
the past week because he's been heavily demonized by the likes of CNN and Fox News. There's a video

344
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:41,580
on YouTube which came to my attention about a week ago. It's only been posted for about

345
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:49,740
10, 11 days. It's called the Sandy Hook shooting fully exposed. 10.6 million plus people have

346
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:56,140
watched this video in the space of the last 10, 11 days alone. That shows you how voracious the

347
00:33:56,140 --> 00:34:01,660
interest is in this whole Sandy Hook issue. And I mean, I'm coming at it from a perspective of

348
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:08,460
there are lots of unanswered questions. I don't buy into the notion that this never happened or

349
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:14,140
that the parents, the family members involved were actors in some sense, which some people

350
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:19,820
have claimed. I think it was a real tragedy. It really happened. But there are plenty of

351
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:25,980
unanswered questions that go along with it that suggest more people than the accused shooter,

352
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:30,620
Adam Lanza, may have been involved. So we're going to get into that now with Professor James Tracy.

353
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:39,180
So Professor, you know, the Obama administration has built its entire gun control move on the

354
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:44,460
notion that Adam Lanza shot these children with an AR-15 assault rifle. They're trying to ban

355
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:51,100
the assault rifles now. Given that, wouldn't it be the perfect poster child to actually have

356
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:59,020
even a still image from a surveillance camera of Adam Lanza with this AR-15 assault rifle

357
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:05,020
when in reality we've seen nothing, no surveillance footage, no still images of the

358
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:11,020
shooter when in past, you know, mass shootings, school shootings, images of the shooter,

359
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:17,260
thinking about Columbine, Virginia Tech, have emerged within days. But of Adam Lanza,

360
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:21,420
we've seen absolutely nothing. Is that one of the questions that you've been talking about?

361
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:29,260
It's a central question, Paul. The Sandy Hook School District installed a new security system

362
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:34,220
in September. Now, this is a very affluent community and they would not have cut corners

363
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:40,220
in terms of video surveillance and the ability to be able to store that video that's taken.

364
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:45,980
So there's a glaring problem here with regard to what is actually going on. Where is that

365
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:52,780
video footage? I think we can safely conclude that there was video footage captured, but where is it

366
00:35:52,780 --> 00:36:01,980
now? One scenario is that the one individual or team of individuals went in and went to the

367
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:08,060
main office and may have turned off the video surveillance. But we've not heard from the

368
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:13,660
officials whether or not that is in fact the case. If it was Adam Lanza, would he have had

369
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:20,300
the foresight and sophistication to be able to pull something like that off? If it was a crew,

370
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:26,460
you know, a team of shooters, that may have in fact been the case. That's the only thing that

371
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:33,180
I've heard about possibly explaining why there might not be video surveillance other than just

372
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:39,740
holding back on it and attempting to, for example, doctor it. That's something I believe that Mike

373
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:47,020
Adams had a piece a couple of days ago about where is the surveillance footage. It's a very

374
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:52,860
big question because if they want to put a lot of our queries to rest, they could release that.

375
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:58,620
We could see Lanza committing the crimes and that would be the end of it. Another thing that might

376
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:06,460
point to is that handguns were used because those were what the initial reports stated. In fact,

377
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:12,780
NBC News confirmed the reports from state and federal officials that there were four

378
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:19,020
handguns used. This was on the morning of December 15th, Pete Williams on the NBC Today show.

379
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:25,900
That was changed on the afternoon of December 15th by the Connecticut medical examiner H.

380
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:33,900
Wayne Carver to being the AR-15, solely the AR-15 that was used. That was at the press conference

381
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:43,580
at about 3.30, I believe 3.15, 3.30 p.m. on December 15th. And we had reports that the actual

382
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:49,260
assault rifle was left in the vehicle, but then the video showed the police removing what looked

383
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:54,540
like a shotgun out of the trunk of the vehicle. So do we know, have we pinned down exactly what's

384
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:58,380
going on with the specific weapons that were used or is that still contradictory?

385
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:04,220
I think that it's still contradictory. The footage looks as if it was a shotgun,

386
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:12,060
but altogether there were, I believe there were at least six weapons or seven weapons,

387
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:18,380
if you include at one point or another that somehow materialize on the scene and then disappear.

388
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:25,340
There are the four pistols, there's the AR-15, and then there are two Enfield rifles that are

389
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:30,140
referenced at one point or another in the reportage. So we've got a total of, I believe,

390
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:37,100
at least seven weapons that are mentioned, that are pointed to by officials in journalistic

391
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:42,700
reports and then somehow disappear. And then we are down to the one weapon, the AR-15,

392
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:49,260
which we might at the very least surmise that this is what was one of the things, one of the

393
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:54,540
weapons that looks the most dangerous and the one that might be targeted in legislation and

394
00:38:54,540 --> 00:39:02,620
executive orders. Now we've got these reports of two men in the woods, obviously we've all seen

395
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:08,380
all seen the footage of them being apprehended in the woods. One has been explained as a parent who

396
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:13,580
went to the school to help his son bake, I think it was gingerbread men or something,

397
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:19,020
that's kind of been explained. He said he heard the gunshots, he was petrified, he ran away.

398
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:25,100
There was another report of a separate man in the woods though, and it emerged in a Newtown B

399
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:31,020
report, quote, a man with a gun who was spotted in the woods. So this is a guy with a gun around

400
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:35,980
a school massacre. A man with a gun who was spotted in the woods near the school on the day

401
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:44,140
of the incident was an off-duty tactical squad police officer from another town. So why is a

402
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:50,460
guy who's a police officer from another town in the woods outside where a massacre's taking place

403
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:55,580
with a gun? I mean, is that a place where people would go hunting right next to a school?

404
00:39:55,580 --> 00:40:00,940
So Professor, just tell us about the reports of additional individuals that may have been involved

405
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:09,580
in this event. Well, the footage, the aerial footage that is taken by the Associated Press

406
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:16,860
shows at least one figure fleeing the scene being pursued by police officers. So if there was

407
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:24,460
someone up in the woods, they must have come back down and then been chased back up into the woods.

408
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:31,820
At one point, about a week or so ago, J. Paul Vance, the Connecticut State Police Lieutenant,

409
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:37,100
said that the individual up in the woods was just chopping wood, just happened to be there

410
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:41,020
chopping wood. Well, maybe they came down to the school and got a drink of water or something and

411
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:49,100
then went back up there. That footage also shows, you can see someone in the upper left-hand portion

412
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:56,060
of the video footage, someone who emerges behind a tree. And they remain unaccounted for, so

413
00:40:56,060 --> 00:41:02,620
apparently they escaped. But of course, as you know, there's also the CBS footage of a bystander

414
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:10,140
who remarks that this individual was paraded by them and said to them, the onlookers, that

415
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:16,540
I didn't do it. And then they took the individual and put them in the front seats of the patrol car.

416
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:26,300
I'm very skeptical of accepting the Newtown B as a valid source for information after

417
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:32,940
the really contradictory reports initially from December 14th. First of all, quoting the principal,

418
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:38,460
Dawn Hawksprung, and then retracting that and never saying who actually was that they spoke to.

419
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:46,940
So I'm really very suspicious of that particular medium. And then apparently the individual that

420
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:58,460
was spotted in the parking lot was a parent. That as well, I've not really seen anything that would

421
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:11,660
confirm that. I know that that is out there, but this was an individual that was spotted by a

422
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:18,060
student who was being interviewed, who had experienced the evacuation of the building.

423
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:25,180
And I believe that would have been the alleged parent that somehow fled onto the scene

424
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:34,540
all of a sudden. There are also questions with regard to the alleged photograph of the evacuation

425
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:40,860
of the 15 or 16 students that were being evacuated that really did make the national

426
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:49,740
and international news. That was supposedly taken by one of the Newtown B associate editors

427
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:57,740
as she came onto the scene in the back of the first responders. And she said that she was

428
00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:04,460
taking photographs left and right, and yet only two photographs emerged from that series of photos.

429
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:12,540
So there's this conflicting information as well with regard to the additional suspects on the

430
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:18,300
scene, but we've not really been given any conclusive evidence as far as I'm concerned,

431
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:25,420
really, as to who they were and what they were doing there and whether or not they may have been

432
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:33,100
accessories in the crime. Yeah, there are a lot of questions about the lack of children, the lack

433
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:38,540
of parents, the lack of teachers being seen in the actual surrounding area after the massacres

434
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:43,660
happened. Of course, the school was on lockdown for a time, but then everybody was evacuated.

435
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:50,380
I was thinking maybe that's only because the mass media showed up quite a while later after

436
00:43:50,380 --> 00:44:01,020
everybody had already been evacuated. That may have been the case. If you note the school shooting

437
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:09,740
at Union, excuse me, Taft Union High School out by Bakersfield, there was media on the scene

438
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:18,300
there, and that's a school comparable in student body to the Newtown, to Sandy Hook. There are

439
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:27,340
about 850, 900 students there, and there's a very evident evacuation taking place there where the

440
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:34,220
sidewalks are flooded with students. But we see none of that in Newtown, and where the students

441
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:41,900
would have converged over at the fire hall, the fire station, there's a limited degree of activity

442
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:49,420
there as well. So some of these things also made me suspicious. Exactly what is going on here?

443
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:54,380
Is this an event that is in some way, shape, or form being embellished? Because I think that

444
00:44:54,380 --> 00:45:00,380
something took place there as well, but I'm wondering as to what degree it may be somewhat

445
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:08,620
fortified, if you will. And also, there were these bizarre reports of people dressed as nuns

446
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:13,820
fleeing the scene in a purple van, and then we've got this photograph of these black veils being

447
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:19,180
found near the scene on the ground. Did you hear about that report? Well, yeah, I believe in fact

448
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:26,220
that it was someone who was calling the Alex Jones show on the morning of the incident that reported

449
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:34,460
this initially, and that's the first time that it emerged really on the news. And there was also an

450
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:40,300
article on the intel hub that delves into this to some degree. In fact, I believe there was a

451
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:50,140
photograph taken of these individuals, and they're wearing footwear similar to what police officers

452
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:57,340
would wear. Yeah, I actually saw that photo earlier today. It's definitely bizarre. But I mean,

453
00:45:57,340 --> 00:46:03,020
the problem we've got is amidst all these legitimate questions about the narrative, what

454
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:08,460
happened, who was involved, there's a plethora of claims that are obviously either completely

455
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:15,580
baseless or are woefully reductionist. And I think the whole thing about Emily Parker supposedly

456
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:21,500
not being killed and then being included in that photo with Obama is clearly one of them, because

457
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:27,580
if you look at the high res images, you can quite clearly prove that it is in fact her sister, who

458
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:33,420
obviously wasn't one of the victims. So I mean, what do you say to the idea that, you know, some

459
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:40,460
people are really making huge leaps of logic, and in doing so, are detracting from any real

460
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:45,740
understanding of what happened? Because I've seen some really just crazy things like, you know,

461
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:51,340
Robbie Parker, one of the parents is actually Tony Hawk, the skateboard guy. So it's good. There's a

462
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:56,540
lot of people poisoning the well with bizarre craziness. And it's really not helping us

463
00:46:56,540 --> 00:47:02,620
understand what actually happened, is it? Well, I've seen a lot of activity on my blog as well,

464
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:09,180
the comments and things of the like. And I, I think that there is definitely a lot of

465
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:17,580
information. There is definitely a program to sow misinformation in the stream of information in

466
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:26,780
order to muddy the waters. And in the process, discredit the research, really the research that

467
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:33,820
independent researchers and the like are putting together and alternative media. Because if you

468
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:39,820
can discredit it or muddy the waters to a limited degree in one area, you can paint with a fairly

469
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:47,660
broad brush, the mainstream corporate media can do that. So I, you know, I'm not very surprised if

470
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:54,380
if things like that are being are being spread. I'm also somewhat suspicious of the, you know,

471
00:47:54,380 --> 00:48:00,140
some of the web pages, or some of, for example, a Facebook page that is created a few days ahead of

472
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:08,540
time. These are very curious, curious phenomena. I know less about the phase of the mechanics of

473
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:14,060
Facebook, and the extent to which dates can be changed to really draw any conclusions with with

474
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:20,140
regard with regard to that. And it's somewhat one has to be careful as well.

475
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:27,340
Well, I mean, that is interesting. But for me, it's not proof of anything, because you can create

476
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:32,940
a Facebook page, and then rename it to something else. So the original timestamp on the Facebook

477
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:38,460
page will say, you know, for example, December 10. And then you rename it to something else later

478
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:44,940
on. Also, obviously, I work in, you know, web publishing, and you can change your timestamp

479
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:50,220
as easy as anything. So I mean, that for me, that's, you know, it's quite bizarre, like a lot

480
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:55,500
of the other stuff, but it's not really proof of anything. We're going to get back into the details

481
00:48:55,500 --> 00:49:00,460
shortly. I just want to get your take on this. Luis Tambasquio, who was a family friend of the

482
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:07,980
Lanzas, told 60 Minutes, quote, I know he was on medication. Professor, why over a month later,

483
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:11,820
do we not know anything about what psychiatric drugs Adam Lanza was on?

484
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:19,740
I think that this is a very valid question that journalists such as John Rappaport have asserted.

485
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:26,620
Why is it that we don't know what his physician's name is? If he was, in fact, under psychiatric

486
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:33,180
care, or the equivalent, and what types of drugs he may have been on. There's a drug that I've

487
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:42,620
never heard of called, I believe, Tamaft, that he was supposedly on. But again, there's a limited

488
00:49:42,620 --> 00:49:49,980
amount of information that's been disclosed by authorities or otherwise.

489
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:56,540
There was actually, talking about disinformation, there was an individual who claimed to be Lanza's

490
00:49:56,540 --> 00:50:03,740
uncle, who was circulating around the media a few weeks ago now. And he actually put out the name

491
00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:09,020
of the drug that Lanza was supposedly on. Bunch of publications ran with it, including New York

492
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:15,340
Magazine, I think. And it was complete, this info is completely made up. So again, another example

493
00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:21,020
of how people are poisoning the well to distract people from understanding what actually happened.

494
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:27,020
But of course, it took nearly six months to get confirmation that James Holmes was on psychiatric

495
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:34,860
drugs. But we still don't know exactly which ones. So again, as you said, I mean, these SSRIs are

496
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:41,100
the elephant in the living room, aren't they? Because while the media will talk about video

497
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:46,220
games and things like that, they won't address the psychiatric drugs that are prevalent amongst

498
00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:53,100
almost all of these mass shooters throughout the last 20 years. Well, actually, Sanjay Gupta did

499
00:50:53,100 --> 00:51:05,900
a piece on CNN. We'll talk about it after the break, got to leave it left now. We'll be back, stay tuned.

500
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:28,860
Now here's the best part. Every year we accumulate a few solar generators that we just can't sell

501
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:34,460

502
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:39,900
end of each year. We call them scratch and dent units, but they're really just like new. Each unit

503
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:45,020
comes with a full factory warranty and special bonuses you just won't believe. Don't wait,

00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:51,020
they go fast. Go to scratchanddentsolar.com, that's scratchanddentsolar.com. For the craziest

527
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:19,180
Mike Adams will be here in the second half of the show to take you to the end of the broadcast,

528
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:24,620
but right now we're talking to Professor James Tracy of Florida Atlantic University.

529
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:30,460
He's controversially questioned the official narrative behind the Sandy Hook school shooting,

530
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:35,580
and he's been demonized and attacked by the likes of CNN and Fox News for doing so.

531
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:47,260
I'm going to say your calls for the professor coming up shortly at 800-259-9231. That's 800-259-9231.

532
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:52,540
We were talking about some of the disinformation that gets mixed into all these questions,

533
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:59,340
which kind of poisons the well. And obviously, I believe that this was a horrible tragedy for

534
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:05,740
all the parents involved. And I believe that some of the people who are asking questions about this,

535
00:55:05,740 --> 00:55:11,820
not the professor, but a lot of people on YouTube have handled it in a rather insensitive way.

536
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:16,540
Of course, we've had reports about them harassing some of the people who were involved.

537
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:23,500
And basically, it doesn't do us any favors. So we need to treat it, obviously, with extreme caution

538
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:29,900
because it's a very traumatic event. And I think one of the aspects of this, which a lot of people

539
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:37,020
have claimed, professor, is this whole idea that there were, quote, crisis actors who were working

540
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:43,020
with the media to create a fake narrative surrounding this event. And this is where we

541
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:48,220
probably differ. But just give us your take on the whole crisis actors angle. Explain what that is.

542
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:59,260
The crisis actors is a group based out of Denver, Colorado, I believe. And they work in association

543
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:06,540
with the Department of Homeland Security on active shooter drills. So they are involved

544
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:17,740
in playing the roles of bystanders, of perhaps the shooter himself, the victims in some cases,

545
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:28,460
the individuals involved posting things to social media. In other words, they are all encompassing

546
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:34,540
in creating an environment for a lifelike drill. Now, there was a drill that took place,

547
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:39,740
by the way, along these lines. Now, I don't know if crisis actors were involved, but this was in a

548
00:56:39,740 --> 00:56:47,100
school for disabled children in Harlem. And the children were absolutely terrified. So in some

549
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:54,540
cases, it's not known whether or not an event is actually taking place, but it's made more lifelike

550
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:58,300
by the crisis actors. Again, I don't know if they were involved in that particular drill. And that's

551
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:04,860
an incident that's sort of foamed beyond the mainstream media radar. But these individuals,

552
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:16,860
they're deployed within the community and they go ahead and they embellish the particular event. So

553
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:29,260
if this were a drill that somehow went live, as we know that, for example, 9-11 and the 7705

554
00:57:29,260 --> 00:57:36,780
bombings were, then it would have involved actors along these lines and they would not even know

555
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:46,060
whether or not the drill itself went live. One of the things that made me question in this regard

556
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:51,900
was looking at the video footage as well as the photographic evidence emerging from the scene.

557
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:58,140
And as you had alluded to earlier, there were just, you know, there were few bystanders and

558
00:57:58,140 --> 00:58:02,780
the like. There were very few people actually being interviewed when you would think there

559
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:08,140
would be a great many people on the scene. Now, maybe what you say is correct. Maybe the media

560
00:58:08,140 --> 00:58:15,100
got there late and there was no photographic or video evidence along those lines. There were just

561
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:21,580
a few people that they could actually interview. But that's one of the reasons that I actually

562
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:27,180
put that forward. The possibility of there being crisis actors. And I think it's probably been the

563
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:32,620
most controversial. Okay, we'll be back after the break. Stay there. Your calls for Professor

570
00:59:58,380 --> 01:00:12,220
Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.

571
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:21,180
He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.

572
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:29,420
It's Paul Joseph Watson filling in for Alex Jones today. We're talking to Professor James

573
01:00:29,420 --> 01:00:35,020
Tracy of Florida Atlantic University. He's questioned the official narrative behind the

574
01:00:35,020 --> 01:00:41,580
Sandy Hook School massacre and basically being pursued by CNN as a result of it and other news

575
01:00:41,580 --> 01:00:52,380
organizations. We're going to go to your calls shortly. The number is 800-259-9231. That's 800-259-9231.

576
01:00:53,020 --> 01:00:58,620
Before the break, we were talking about the idea that some of these individuals involved in this

577
01:00:58,620 --> 01:01:04,300
event may have been actors or participants in a drill. Of course, we know that drills

578
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:11,100
shadow both 9-11 and 7-7. And you have to frame all this while being sensitive to the

579
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:17,260
fact that it was, according to my mind, a very real tragedy involving very real victims. But

580
01:01:17,260 --> 01:01:22,940
you have to frame it in the context that under Fast and Furious, the Obama administration

581
01:01:22,940 --> 01:01:31,980
sent 2,000 assault weapons to drug lords in Mexico, resulting in the deaths of over 300

582
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:37,660
people, many of them children. So to claim that this would be beyond the government to

583
01:01:37,660 --> 01:01:45,500
stoop to such a level to kill 20 kids to ram through their political agenda is somewhat

584
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:52,380
naive, given what we've seen historically with the likes of Operation Gladio and other false flag

585
01:01:52,380 --> 01:01:57,900
terror programs, which are on the record all admitted. They've been subject to parliamentary

586
01:01:57,900 --> 01:02:04,940
investigations in countries like Italy, admitted that government stage mass shootings, they stage

587
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:12,460
bombings, they bomb trains for their own political agenda. So asking questions about an event that

588
01:02:12,460 --> 01:02:20,300
has been the fulcrum of the Obama administration's agenda on gun control is only sensible while,

589
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:26,380
of course, maintaining that respect, that dignity, that sensitivity for the victims.

590
01:02:26,380 --> 01:02:32,220
But what sprung to my mind before the break is, professor, straight after the collapse

591
01:02:32,220 --> 01:02:39,100
of the Twin Towers on 9-11, we had people on the ground who seemed to know, bizarrely,

592
01:02:39,100 --> 01:02:44,700
intricate details of how that collapsed happened, which just happened to then morph almost

593
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:49,420
immediately into the official story. So I guess that's what you're talking about when you're

594
01:02:49,420 --> 01:02:53,020
talking about acts as being involved. You're not saying there were no victims. You're just

595
01:02:53,020 --> 01:02:57,180
saying that people may have been there to massage the narrative. Is that correct?

596
01:02:57,740 --> 01:03:05,420
Yes, that's correct, Paul. I am simply posing questions, and I never said anything

597
01:03:05,420 --> 01:03:11,980
declarative in any of my articles about this happened. I was saying, could this be a

598
01:03:11,980 --> 01:03:20,940
possibility? And yet the media took that and ran with it, took my assertion as an allegation when

599
01:03:20,940 --> 01:03:25,740
it was merely a question. And that, unfortunately, is how this has been framed and how I think

600
01:03:25,740 --> 01:03:32,460
that it's been offensive, especially to the people that lost their loved ones up there in

601
01:03:32,460 --> 01:03:38,540
Newtown. I never actually intended that in any way, shape, or form. But certainly, yes,

602
01:03:38,540 --> 01:03:46,540
what you point out with regard to 9-11 is really right on, in that this idea that a

603
01:03:46,540 --> 01:03:54,220
steel-frame building could collapse as a result of the heat from the airplanes, I think, is

604
01:03:54,220 --> 01:04:03,340
something that was put out there at the time to sort of deflect any questioning as to how could

605
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:09,260
this have actually taken place, these buildings going down in such a way, in their own footprint.

606
01:04:11,020 --> 01:04:15,020
Just got a minute to go to the break. We're going to go to your call, the first of which is

607
01:04:15,020 --> 01:04:21,260
Adam. We'll go to him after the break. Other aspects that I want to get into, obviously,

608
01:04:21,260 --> 01:04:27,260
we've got things about Adam Lanza's car, a picture with all four doors open. Why would that be the

609
01:04:27,260 --> 01:04:32,700
case if he was just exiting the car on his own? As you mentioned earlier, the school principal

610
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:37,740
gives the quote to the Newtown B describing the attack, but she's actually the first victim of the

611
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:43,500
attack. That's another inconsistency that hasn't been explained. We'll go into it and more with

612
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:50,380
your calls. Professor Tracy, after the break, this is the Alex Jones show, infowars.com. Stay tuned.

613
01:04:50,380 --> 01:05:14,860

ourselves, how did we ever survive from natural disasters like hurricane Sandy and the devastating

622
01:06:07,260 --> 01:06:12,540
summer drought to the family hardships brought on by a disastrous economy. Our hearts go out to

625
01:06:22,380 --> 01:06:27,340
Danny from New York city wrote, almost all the grocery stores are closed, but I managed to get

626
01:06:27,340 --> 01:06:32,860

Big brother, mainstream media, government cover ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's

01:08:13,660 --> 01:08:21,420
Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.

641
01:08:21,420 --> 01:08:29,260
It's Paul Joseph Watson, writer with Infowars.com, filling in for Alex today.

642
01:08:29,260 --> 01:08:35,100
Got a headline up on PrisonPlanet.com. Holder begs courts to stop document release on Fast and

643
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:41,340
Furious. Basically, they're trying to stop a lawsuit brought by Judicial Watch asking them

644
01:08:41,340 --> 01:08:47,900
to open records relating to Operation Fast and Furious, which, of course, was the program which

645
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:53,820
many view as a deliberate effort to undermine the Second Amendment, where the Obama administration

646
01:08:53,820 --> 01:09:01,820
sent 2,000 assault weapons to drug lords in Mexico, leading to the deaths of 300 people.

647
01:09:03,020 --> 01:09:08,780
If you think it's beyond the Obama administration to engage in murder to further their gun control

648
01:09:08,780 --> 01:09:15,420
agenda, remembering the fact that it was Obama himself back in April 2011 who told Sarah Brady

649
01:09:15,420 --> 01:09:21,260
in a White House meeting he was working, quote, under the radar to sneak attack the Second

650
01:09:21,260 --> 01:09:27,580
Amendment, then we'd be very naive to think that they wouldn't engage in such activity.

651
01:09:28,220 --> 01:09:33,820
We're talking to Professor James Tracy about the Sandy Hook Massacre, the questions that he's

652
01:09:33,820 --> 01:09:40,540
raised about the event and subsequently being attacked by the media for asking. Adam in Canada,

653
01:09:40,540 --> 01:09:46,220
you're on the air. Go ahead, Adam. Yeah, kudos for having the courage to cover this. I have a

654
01:09:46,220 --> 01:09:53,820
couple questions. Go ahead. Yeah, I think it's great that he got the thing about the shotgun

655
01:09:53,820 --> 01:09:59,180
in the trunk, right, and the dress with the daughter. Those are up there. But what I haven't

656
01:09:59,180 --> 01:10:05,340
heard, I'd like to hear him talk about is the question of whether or not that was Adam Lanza's

657
01:10:05,340 --> 01:10:12,380
car. And also if you've seen some of the rebranding of businesses in the area, if you go to

658
01:10:12,380 --> 01:10:20,300
sandyhookhairco.com, Sandy Hook Hair Company, and see their whole image, their whole bloody

659
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:25,820
handprint and the white heart in the palm. And finally, of course, the whole thing about the

660
01:10:25,820 --> 01:10:31,340
Batman map in the movie, the Batman movie, having Sandy Hook on it and also actually lining up to

661
01:10:31,340 --> 01:10:35,980
the roads in Newton with a circle on the school, which is the stadium that's attacking the movie.

662
01:10:37,740 --> 01:10:45,020
Go ahead, professor. Okay, well, there's quite a bit there. First, with regard to Adam Lanza's car,

663
01:10:45,980 --> 01:10:56,780
this was apparently registered to a Chris Rodia. And yet there was an article that came out

664
01:10:56,780 --> 01:11:07,100
arguing that this was not the case. I think it was in a Hearst paper that the car was not

665
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:15,900
registered to him. But in fact, it turns out that it was and that Rodia, you know,

666
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:23,980
he had a number of run-ins with the law. He had been involved apparently in drug

667
01:11:23,980 --> 01:11:31,980
running and the like. So that's as much as I know with regard to the automobile.

668
01:11:31,980 --> 01:11:40,060
And what were the other questions? Well, there's this crazy rebranding of businesses with

669
01:11:40,060 --> 01:11:46,380
Illuminati symbology. I mean, it's totally out there, but go to sandyhookhairco.com and you'll

670
01:11:46,380 --> 01:11:51,660
see their website with the bloody red handprint and the whole thing, white heart in the palm.

671
01:11:51,660 --> 01:11:58,380
And then, of course, the whole Batman movie map, Sandy Hook. Go to YouTube,

672
01:11:58,380 --> 01:12:02,380
Batman map, Sandy Hook, a strange comparison. You'll see this one-minute video.

673
01:12:04,460 --> 01:12:09,900
I've seen that, professor, but I mean, there's a place, obviously, Gotham City is based on New

674
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:15,020
York City and there's a place in New York City called Sandy Hook. That's how I understood it.

675
01:12:15,020 --> 01:12:23,100
Yeah, and that does come up, but I think one hour and 58 minutes into The Dark Knight Rises,

676
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:28,780
there's that specifically on the map, from what I understand. I haven't seen the movie in its

677
01:12:28,780 --> 01:12:36,620
entirety. And somehow I saw that on my blog just recently, someone putting something in there with

678
01:12:36,620 --> 01:12:42,940
regard to the hair salon or the hair company, but I've not seen the actual imagery itself.

679
01:12:42,940 --> 01:12:49,580
So I can't really comment on that. Okay, thanks for the call. Yeah, I think the thing with the

680
01:12:49,580 --> 01:12:56,140
car was, how I read it, it was like a bleed in the police transmission tapes, where he had been

681
01:12:56,140 --> 01:13:01,020
apprehended in a completely different city and that bled through to their transmission, which

682
01:13:01,020 --> 01:13:05,580
is why it got confused with Adam Lanza. That's how it was explained, whether that's true or not.

683
01:13:05,580 --> 01:13:16,540
It was explained in a mainstream media outlet that he was mistaken, but whether or not that

684
01:13:16,540 --> 01:13:25,180
is in fact the case is still somewhat questionable. But it's a very good question.

685
01:13:26,300 --> 01:13:30,860
And the other stuff doesn't really, I mean, it's all very weird, but it doesn't prove anything for

686
01:13:30,860 --> 01:13:38,220
me. Father James in California, you're on the air, go ahead. Good morning. It's good to talk

687
01:13:38,220 --> 01:13:46,220
to you. I've been a listener of the show probably about a year and initially thought that Alex was

688
01:13:47,580 --> 01:13:52,540
rather paranoid until I began researching everything that he was talking about and finding

689
01:13:52,540 --> 01:13:59,660
so much support and information. I have family members that are educators. My father served

690
01:13:59,660 --> 01:14:08,460
in special forces in Vietnam. And the kind of false flag attack is something that I've heard

691
01:14:08,460 --> 01:14:15,500
about from him. In Vietnam, he said it was a common tactic for them to go into a Vietnamese

692
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:22,300
village, do attacks, leave evidence of it being North Vietnamese or Viet Cong, then come in

693
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:30,140
in subsequent days to respond to their outrage and recruit them and train them to fight against the

694
01:14:31,020 --> 01:14:35,420
North Vietnamese. So it's a tactic that's been around for a long time.

695
01:14:37,260 --> 01:14:41,820
And thinking about these questions, my thoughts have been that the conversation in the media,

696
01:14:42,460 --> 01:14:47,820
especially as it's put out by the government, is how many lives will we save by banning guns?

697
01:14:47,820 --> 01:14:53,660
And I think the question really needs to be turned around. How many lives are we going

698
01:14:53,660 --> 01:15:02,140
to sacrifice if we limit or restrict guns from law-abiding citizens? And I think a very practical

699
01:15:02,140 --> 01:15:09,980
way to arm our teachers, we have a lot of police chiefs and sheriffs that are standing up now

700
01:15:09,980 --> 01:15:14,540
saying that they're going to defend Second Amendment rights. A very simple approach would

701
01:15:14,540 --> 01:15:20,860
be for them to issue conceal and carry permits to teachers, and then to overcome the ban or

702
01:15:20,860 --> 01:15:29,820
guns at school is to deputize them. Sheriffs, police chiefs can deputize citizens in service

703
01:15:29,820 --> 01:15:35,980
so they can train them, license them, deputize them, and it'll be legal for those teachers

704
01:15:35,980 --> 01:15:43,420
to have a firearm concealed on campus. Well, professor, would you, professor,

705
01:15:43,420 --> 01:15:49,500
would you feel safer if your kids were in a school where you knew the teacher had a safely

706
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:54,460
locked away gun in the event of some crazed killer coming into the school? I mean, would

707
01:15:54,460 --> 01:16:04,140
you feel safer? Well, I certainly know that individuals such as Barack Obama, his children

708
01:16:04,140 --> 01:16:09,980
go to a school that is safe and secure in that regard and has armed guards. I think

709
01:16:09,980 --> 01:16:15,340
that's likely the case with many of the, many of the country's elite and the, you know,

710
01:16:15,340 --> 01:16:22,140
the elite of the world. They, most of their children go to, you know, go to facilities,

711
01:16:22,140 --> 01:16:27,340
go to institutions that have that type of security. So why shouldn't the broader public?

712
01:16:27,340 --> 01:16:33,100
And of course, Obama just signed the bill where he gets lifetime armed secret service

713
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:41,180
protection. While all the rest of you lowly peasant American citizens are disarmed, Jacob

714
01:16:41,180 --> 01:16:46,620
in Illinois, you're on the air, Jacob, go ahead. Oh, hi. I've been a listener for a

715
01:16:46,620 --> 01:16:53,820
couple of days now. I like the show. I was wondering what kind of gun was it again that

716
01:16:53,820 --> 01:16:59,420
the kids were killed with? Like a big rifle or something? I was just wondering, how did he,

717
01:16:59,420 --> 01:17:03,020
how did he get it into the school in the first place?

718
01:17:05,260 --> 01:17:09,420
Professor, that's what the medical examiner addressed, isn't it? If you want to cover it

719
01:17:09,420 --> 01:17:17,820
from that angle. Yeah, this came up, this is when the story was, was significantly altered

720
01:17:17,820 --> 01:17:24,860
during that press conference from, as far as, as far as I can tell from the, the four handguns,

721
01:17:24,860 --> 01:17:31,740
which is what was being reported at eight o'clock or eight thirty a.m. on the NBC Today show

722
01:17:31,740 --> 01:17:37,100
to the single AR-15. And during that press conference, and it's important to really look

723
01:17:37,100 --> 01:17:42,780
at that press conference, because I think that's really the most revealing piece of evidence and

724
01:17:42,780 --> 01:17:52,140
information in this case, is that this is the weapon is almost changed immediately from the,

725
01:17:52,140 --> 01:17:59,260
from the, from the pistols to the AR-15. And even a reporter says, speaks up and says,

726
01:17:59,260 --> 01:18:05,100
but the, the rifle was found in the car. And at that point, the Connecticut State

727
01:18:05,100 --> 01:18:10,620
Police Lieutenant Vance said, that's not correct, sir. That's not correct. So it's at that point

728
01:18:10,620 --> 01:18:17,340
where, where things change. How he, now how he got the weapon into the, into the school? Well,

729
01:18:17,340 --> 01:18:22,700
he, he approached the, according to the official story, he approached the entrance of the school

730
01:18:22,700 --> 01:18:29,180
and he, he shot, shot out the, the front, the front door and with a hole big enough to,

731
01:18:29,180 --> 01:18:34,540
to enter. Yet we've not seen any video evidence that that in fact took place,

732
01:18:34,540 --> 01:18:39,420
nor has there been any video or photographic evidence of the, the door itself, the entry point

733
01:18:39,420 --> 01:18:46,620
itself. Thanks for the call, Jacob. Josh in California, you're on the air with Professor

734
01:18:46,620 --> 01:18:56,460
Tracy, go ahead. All right, Josh has dropped. Professor, tell us about the, this pejorative

735
01:18:56,460 --> 01:19:02,060
term conspiracy theory you wanted to talk about, the dynamics between how that's being used by the

736
01:19:02,060 --> 01:19:10,940
establishment media in relation to this event. Well, I think that as, as an academic, and I

737
01:19:10,940 --> 01:19:17,100
think this is also the case with regard to journalists, they fear being called a, a

738
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:23,980
conspiracy theorist. That is the pejorative that's being used against me to make an example out of

739
01:19:23,980 --> 01:19:31,500
me, to threaten my job, to get me to, to be quiet, to not ask questions. It's important to think

740
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:38,300
about the, the how this term originated, how actually it developed. There's an important

741
01:19:38,300 --> 01:19:43,900
book called Conspiracy Theory in America that's being, that's coming out in April of this year

742
01:19:43,900 --> 01:19:50,140
by a colleague of mine, Lance DeHaven Smith up at Florida State University. Now he helped to

743
01:19:50,140 --> 01:19:55,980
devise the, the concept of state crimes against democracy. This is something that's wrong. We'll

744
01:19:55,980 --> 01:20:00,860
be back, final segment, we'll finish that after the break. Stay tuned, Alex Jones showing. Looking

745
01:20:00,860 --> 01:20:06,380
back on 2012, we asked ourselves, how did we ever survive from natural disasters like hurricane

746
01:20:06,380 --> 01:20:11,260
Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on by a disastrous

747
01:20:11,260 --> 01:20:16,140
economy? Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything. At eFoods Direct, we hear from

749
01:20:20,860 --> 01:20:26,300
hand. After hurricane Sandy, Danny from New York City wrote, almost all the grocery stores are

750
01:20:26,300 --> 01:20:31,980
closed, but I managed to get my eFoods just in time to be able to help my sister and niece. It

751
01:20:31,980 --> 01:20:37,260

766
01:22:01,580 --> 01:22:06,540
45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.

767
01:22:06,540 --> 01:22:11,500
Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing and medical,

768
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:16,620
many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line. Is this a flaw for the enterprise or is our

769
01:22:16,620 --> 01:22:21,660
monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation

770
01:22:21,660 --> 01:22:26,300
and higher taxes? These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book,

771
01:22:26,300 --> 01:22:31,100
The Creature from Jekyll Island. Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know

772
01:22:31,100 --> 01:22:36,540

785
01:24:10,300 --> 01:24:15,260
We're back on the Alex Jones Show, Paul Joseph Austin filling in for Alex, talking with Professor

786
01:24:15,260 --> 01:24:20,380
James Tracy of Florida Atlantic University. Professor, just finish up your thought there

787
01:24:20,380 --> 01:24:29,500
quickly about the term conspiracy theory. Yeah, in the mid-1960s, Paul, the US government,

788
01:24:29,500 --> 01:24:35,180
the Central Intelligence Agency were concerned with regard to the, with regard to criticisms

789
01:24:35,180 --> 01:24:43,180
of the Warren Report, so they issued a dispatch to all of their offices. And this dispatch right

790
01:24:43,180 --> 01:24:53,100
here, it's number 1035-960, it's available at the JFK Lancer website, talks about how,

791
01:24:54,140 --> 01:24:59,180
can I read a bit of this, is that okay? Yeah, we'll push for time, but yeah, quickly.

792
01:24:59,180 --> 01:25:05,180
Okay, well it talks about the, how public opinion is almost 50% skeptical of the official

793
01:25:05,180 --> 01:25:11,420
conclusions of the Warren Commission Report, and talks further about employing propaganda

794
01:25:11,420 --> 01:25:17,500
assets to negate and refute the attacks of the critics. Talks specifically about conspiracy

795
01:25:17,500 --> 01:25:26,300
theories and how to, the specific techniques that one could use in CIA asset publications and by CIA

796
01:25:26,300 --> 01:25:35,980
assets themselves in the media industry to essentially subdue any sort of criticism.

797
01:25:35,980 --> 01:25:41,100
And so what I'm getting at in that regard, and you could, again, go to the JFK Lancer site and

798
01:25:41,100 --> 01:25:45,420
read it since we're pressed for time, but I believe it's a key document because this is

799
01:25:45,420 --> 01:25:53,020
something that has, it has in many ways really created fear among journalists and among scholars

800
01:25:53,020 --> 01:25:57,980
to address anything that might be considered a conspiracy theory. I think I know this more

801
01:25:57,980 --> 01:26:04,140
intimately than anyone because I, you know, I can sense that fear among, among others. You can't

802
01:26:04,140 --> 01:26:10,540
touch certain, certain subjects such as 9-11 because you might be accused of this, and this

803
01:26:10,540 --> 01:26:16,300
is something that could, it could cost you your, your job and, or your credibility.

804
01:26:17,420 --> 01:26:21,100
Okay. Todd in Florida, quickly, please. Final call. Go ahead, Todd.

805
01:26:22,140 --> 01:26:25,820
Thanks for taking my call, guys. I got some points about Sandy Hook. Thanks so much for

806
01:26:25,820 --> 01:26:29,580
talking about it today. I think it's something we all need to question. You mentioned at the

807
01:26:29,580 --> 01:26:34,220
press conference, I feel that that is some very important information. Paul Vance dodged

808
01:26:34,220 --> 01:26:39,740
blatantly a question when asked, what was Nancy Lanza's connection to the school? And I believe

809
01:26:39,740 --> 01:26:43,820
that he couldn't answer that question because later it came out that she had no connection.

810
01:26:43,820 --> 01:26:50,860
However, there was a report on the scene from Sally Cox, the 15 year alleged nurse at Sandy Hook,

811
01:26:50,860 --> 01:26:57,020
who told a reporter that she knew Nancy Lanza and that she was an experienced kindergarten teacher.

812
01:26:57,020 --> 01:27:02,540
I think we need to question those things very, very much. Are you also familiar,

813
01:27:03,100 --> 01:27:08,940
are you also familiar with the fundraiser sites that the URLs were created before the event?

814
01:27:08,940 --> 01:27:15,020
Yeah, we talked about that a bit earlier. I don't know if a medical examiner would,

815
01:27:15,020 --> 01:27:20,860
would actually have that information. What I would expect of him as a professional is to have

816
01:27:20,860 --> 01:27:26,620
information specific to the injuries, you know, the causes of death, the caliber of the bullets,

817
01:27:27,340 --> 01:27:32,940
how many girls, how many boys were, were, were slain. These things are just basic and they were

818
01:27:32,940 --> 01:27:40,220
not addressed by Dr. Carver, not in any competent way. And that's the, that's really the major thing

819
01:27:40,220 --> 01:27:46,540
that contributes to my skepticism and caused my, you know, my, my, my initial questioning of the

820
01:27:46,540 --> 01:27:53,100
event. Okay, thanks for the call, Todd. Professor, just tell people about your website, the other

821
01:27:53,100 --> 01:27:59,660
work you do there, how people can find out more information. Yeah, memoryholeblog.com. I've been,

822
01:27:59,660 --> 01:28:05,740
I've had the website since March. There's a lot of stuff on there, you know, primarily there's,

823
01:28:05,740 --> 01:28:13,900
there are essays that, that I've written on, you know, political criticism and, and events such as

824
01:28:13,900 --> 01:28:20,460
this and things that might be regarded as, as conspiracies, but attempting to analyze those

825
01:28:21,180 --> 01:28:27,340
and develop those in a, in a historical context and in a more contemporary context. So it's

826
01:28:27,340 --> 01:28:34,300
memoryholeblog.com. Okay, Professor James Tracy, Florida Atlantic University.

827
01:28:35,260 --> 01:28:39,100
You won't be on CNN tonight then, but you may be on in the next few days.

828
01:28:39,100 --> 01:28:44,540
Well, they've got to get back to me and I'm, I'm willing to, to go on and keep them honest.

829
01:28:45,900 --> 01:28:50,460
Okay, we really appreciate your time. Fascinating questions raised once again,

830
01:28:50,460 --> 01:28:53,340
and we hope to talk to you again soon. Thank you very much.

831
01:28:53,340 --> 01:28:58,300
Thanks Paul. There goes Professor James Tracy raising

832
01:28:58,300 --> 01:29:04,220
questions about the Sandy Hook massacre. And again, this has gone completely viral. It even

833
01:29:04,220 --> 01:29:13,340
surprised me how crazy insane the interest in this is 10.6 million views on one video alone on

834
01:29:13,340 --> 01:29:18,940
YouTube that was created just 10, 11 days ago. And in fact, we're probably going to try and get

835
01:29:18,940 --> 01:29:25,500
the creators behind that video on the show. But tons of videos, tons of questions while

836
01:29:25,500 --> 01:29:31,420
still trying to maintain respect, dignity for the realization that this was a very real tragedy,

837
01:29:31,420 --> 01:29:36,620
but we'll continue to ask questions about it. Mike Adams coming up. This is the Alex Jones

838
01:29:36,620 --> 01:29:42,140
show live. I've been Paul Joseph Watson, infowars.com. We'll be right back with Mike Adams.

839
01:29:42,140 --> 01:29:52,700

freedom lovers. The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to

842
01:30:07,900 --> 01:30:13,980
worse. The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they

843
01:30:13,980 --> 01:30:18,060
acquiesce to the global takeover. That's why we've assembled the most vital and important

all right we're back here on the alex jones show and this is mike adams stepping in for

871
01:33:25,020 --> 01:33:30,300
the next hour and a half here i want to thank paul joseph watson for his eye-opening interview

872
01:33:30,300 --> 01:33:36,540
there i didn't catch all of it because i was obviously uh driving in for to be here but we've

873
01:33:36,540 --> 01:33:42,060
got even more great information coming up this is just hard hitting day after day hour after hour

874
01:33:42,060 --> 01:33:45,580
here's what we have coming up right now on the phone with us and he'll be joining us in just a

875
01:33:45,580 --> 01:33:52,220
minute is representative steve toath from texas who is the person introducing the firearms

876
01:33:52,220 --> 01:33:58,700
protection act that he was on the show i think two days ago here with alex and he's got more updates

877
01:33:58,700 --> 01:34:03,500
for us and i have some new questions for him as well so we'll get an update on that we've also

878
01:34:03,500 --> 01:34:10,940
got today i'm going to give you just a little commentary on lance armstrong and his now staged

879
01:34:10,940 --> 01:34:15,820
confession that he lied all along and all the people that he bullied and threatened and

880
01:34:15,820 --> 01:34:21,980
intimidated were actually correct in saying that he doped so give you a little breakdown on that

881
01:34:21,980 --> 01:34:25,340
but i'm not going to spend too much time on that because there's far more important things happening

882
01:34:25,340 --> 01:34:31,660
in this world than lance armstrong's career we've got smart gun rfid technology now being discussed

883
01:34:31,660 --> 01:34:40,300
for uh firearms this is part of obama's 23 now famous or infamous executive orders new ways to

884
01:34:40,300 --> 01:34:46,860
track firearms owners and the new york pd is also even now suggesting that they should put rfid

885
01:34:46,860 --> 01:34:52,940
chips into your medication that's what they want to track is your drugs and your guns and your

886
01:34:52,940 --> 01:34:58,540
money your cash and probably everything else oh it's getting crazy in any case let's go to

887
01:34:58,540 --> 01:35:04,060
representative steve toath who is on the line with us and he joins us for an update mr toath thank

888
01:35:04,060 --> 01:35:09,100
you for joining us once again here on the alex jones show thanks so much mike i appreciate it

889
01:35:09,660 --> 01:35:15,660
it's great to have you on i heard your interview a couple of days ago i'm i'm very proud that you

890
01:35:15,660 --> 01:35:21,100
are the kind of person who represents the state of texas you're a business owner you're a successful

891
01:35:21,100 --> 01:35:26,700
person in the private space your private industry and you get it about the second amendment about

892
01:35:26,700 --> 01:35:30,700
freedom you're well spoken you're highly intelligent i i think your bill is going to be

893
01:35:30,700 --> 01:35:36,140
very successful what is your read so far on the level of support for this firearms protection act

894
01:35:36,140 --> 01:35:41,500
well there think about this for a second there there there are two elements that are really

895
01:35:41,500 --> 01:35:47,900
critical for this bill going through one is the people of the state of texas and the second is

896
01:35:47,900 --> 01:35:56,940
the lawmakers here in austin and um we have all been shocked and it just i mean i knew it was

897
01:35:56,940 --> 01:36:00,940
an issue and it's not just about the second amendment this is really more about the tenth

898
01:36:00,940 --> 01:36:07,100
amendment than it is the second amendment this is about preserving states right this is about

899
01:36:07,740 --> 01:36:15,180
this is about an executive order an edict by a king not having prominence over

900
01:36:15,180 --> 01:36:22,060
um over the legislative process that's laid out in both the texas and in the west constitution

901
01:36:22,060 --> 01:36:31,100
right and so where things are going really well with this legislation is out in the out in the

902
01:36:31,100 --> 01:36:36,940
streets in in homes and businesses and restaurants all over texas people are talking about it

903
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:41,340
the problem is that there are compete there are going to be some competing bills that are more

904
01:36:41,340 --> 01:36:47,500
moderate we don't need a moderate approach to a desperate problem that is facing america

905
01:36:48,300 --> 01:36:55,740
um we need a strong bill that has real teeth that day one when it goes into effect

906
01:36:56,700 --> 01:37:01,020
the obama administration is going to file an injunction in the fifth circuit probably

907
01:37:01,580 --> 01:37:05,580
to put a stop to it so that this gets challenged all the way to the supreme court

908
01:37:05,580 --> 01:37:10,940
and that's what we need we need this is what that is exactly what we need and so if a moderate bill

909
01:37:10,940 --> 01:37:18,060
goes through without any teeth that they can just overlook and ignore then that's what will happen

910
01:37:18,060 --> 01:37:22,780
so there are a lot of different bills right now but we need for people in the state of texas to

911
01:37:22,780 --> 01:37:27,980
get behind the firearms protection act because that is the bill that is the legislation that

912
01:37:27,980 --> 01:37:33,180
it has the teeth in it that the obama administration is going to force their hand

913
01:37:33,180 --> 01:37:39,100
yes yes but what about what is the actual composition of support in the texas legislature

914
01:37:39,740 --> 01:37:47,020
for possibly being able to actually pass this i mean i know the the the austin area representatives

915
01:37:47,020 --> 01:37:53,100
we're going to get a bill through no no questions asked we're going to get a bill through in

916
01:37:53,100 --> 01:37:58,460
response to what the president has done the problem is there are some more moderate bills

917
01:37:58,460 --> 01:38:04,300
that have come forward um since you know since this whole thing since this media firestorm has

918
01:38:05,180 --> 01:38:10,380
is erupted over the issue yes there are some more moderate bills that have come forward that are

919
01:38:10,380 --> 01:38:14,540
that frankly are going to undermine what we're trying to do here when you say moderate for

920
01:38:14,540 --> 01:38:19,900
example your bill makes it a felony crime for a federal official to try to enforce an

921
01:38:19,900 --> 01:38:25,500
unconstitutional order in the state of texas are you saying that for example that felony is not

922
01:38:25,500 --> 01:38:31,820
present in a less powerful bill it's not it's not present in either bill it's it almost looks more

923
01:38:31,820 --> 01:38:36,300
like a suggestion or a house resolution than it does a bill you might as well just do a house

924
01:38:36,300 --> 01:38:42,220
resolution we hate what obama's you know we we need a bill that has real teeth in it we we need

925
01:38:42,220 --> 01:38:47,980
to draw a line in the sand and say enough we're done now when this was attempted drawing a line

926
01:38:47,980 --> 01:38:53,820
in the sand i think roughly a year ago with the tsa tsa bill that david simpson said that

927
01:38:53,820 --> 01:38:58,540
tsa bill that david simpson put through exactly exactly yeah you know the thing about that bill

928
01:38:58,540 --> 01:39:06,300
is that it started too late if it had started in january like this one is then then that bill

929
01:39:06,300 --> 01:39:12,620
would have had that bill would have had what what what our bill has right now which is it's got this

930
01:39:12,620 --> 01:39:17,900
broad base of support from people all over texas yeah i mean my phone is being rung off the hook

931
01:39:17,900 --> 01:39:24,220
right now we can't we can't get to all the calls as possible well i i'm sure that's the case if i

932
01:39:24,220 --> 01:39:28,780
was in a gun shop just the other day and uh i asked i asked the the owner did you hear about

933
01:39:28,780 --> 01:39:32,380
representative toath's bill and they said are you kidding me everybody that walks in our doors

934
01:39:32,380 --> 01:39:39,740
keeps telling us about it yeah i mean it's it's it's really cool and you know i i don't know if

935
01:39:39,740 --> 01:39:47,900
you've if i'm gonna get i'm gonna get on a faith-packed track here for a second but um this

936
01:39:47,900 --> 01:39:52,940
has been so encouraging and the lord has so encouraged us over and i'll tell you why kendall

937
01:39:52,940 --> 01:39:57,660
croaker is a really great guy he's the guy that that started this thing in wyoming i want to give

938
01:39:57,660 --> 01:40:03,260
him credit for it yes kendall kendall's the one that started this whole thing well it was really

939
01:40:03,260 --> 01:40:09,740
cool as our office got a call yesterday from kendall's sister and she said you know of all

940
01:40:09,740 --> 01:40:14,700
the states that kendall's sister could live in what do you think the chances are that his sister

941
01:40:14,700 --> 01:40:21,180
out of 50 states just happens to live in texas and out of 150 house districts across the state of

942
01:40:21,180 --> 01:40:28,300
texas what are the chances that i live in steve's district wow she lives in district 15 huh she

943
01:40:28,300 --> 01:40:33,980
lives in my district and she goes you know we just we're behind you when we're behind this legislation

944
01:40:33,980 --> 01:40:40,780
you guys are trying to do it the right way and um we want the people in the state of texas to get

945
01:40:40,780 --> 01:40:46,300
behind it because if if abraham lincoln said this he said if you don't have the people behind you

946
01:40:46,300 --> 01:40:50,540
can't do anything great i don't want to do it i don't want to do something moderate i want to

947
01:40:50,540 --> 01:40:55,740
do something great yeah if if you guys get fired up about it if you're willing to call your your

948
01:40:55,740 --> 01:41:00,860
representatives and your senators about it then we can get a strong bill through that that is

949
01:41:00,860 --> 01:41:06,860
a message and also because this is a national and even a global audience this matters to all of you

950
01:41:06,860 --> 01:41:10,860
who are listening right now no matter what state you live in in the united states or even what

951
01:41:10,860 --> 01:41:17,020
country you live in because if texas can set the precedent to standing up to unconstitutional

952
01:41:17,020 --> 01:41:21,820
executive orders from the executive branch of the federal government that sets a precedent that

953
01:41:21,820 --> 01:41:26,860
applies to all 50 states right mr toath yeah i mean think about this folks when you take your

954
01:41:26,860 --> 01:41:31,500
kid to the pediatrician do you want the pediatrician saying to little johnny hey does

955
01:41:31,500 --> 01:41:37,420
your mommy or daddy have a gun at home right i mean seriously i mean this is no different than

956
01:41:37,420 --> 01:41:42,380
how things were in red china when they're turning kids against their parents this is no different

957
01:41:42,380 --> 01:41:49,020
than how things were in the early days of of of uh nazi germany or stasi secret police under

958
01:41:49,020 --> 01:41:54,860
muzalini or whatever yeah you're right it's it's the same kind of snitch society reporting people

959
01:41:54,860 --> 01:42:00,140
reporting honest citizens to the feds to be disarmed or even jailed this is and that's part

960
01:42:00,140 --> 01:42:05,900
of this you know here's how he did things when when he got obama care through it was this nebulous

961
01:42:05,900 --> 01:42:12,620
3700 page we don't know what's in it until until we pass it we can't read it until we pass it

962
01:42:12,620 --> 01:42:19,740
3700 pages of nebulous innocuous stuff oh don't worry about it it's fuzzy it's fluffy it's cuddly

963
01:42:19,740 --> 01:42:25,340
don't worry about it there are no sharp edges to it whatsoever it gets passed now it's 37 000 pages

964
01:42:25,900 --> 01:42:29,980
the only thing worse than a politician that's been in austin or washington too long

965
01:42:31,100 --> 01:42:36,540
is an unelected bureaucrat that's been there too long and they are the ones they're the dangerous

966
01:42:36,540 --> 01:42:43,740
ones that will put words that will put substance to these 23 actions that the president is handed

967
01:42:43,740 --> 01:42:50,460
out yeah that's right folks you better be worried about it let me ask your your opinion uh attorney

968
01:42:50,460 --> 01:42:57,180
general texas attorney general greg abbott put out an ad recently in new york and i love this

969
01:42:57,180 --> 01:43:04,220
and i love what mr abbott has done here and this was written up in reuters with the following title

970
01:43:04,220 --> 01:43:10,780
y'all come to texas state official tells new york gun owners it was a great ad by mr abbott or i i

971
01:43:10,780 --> 01:43:15,740
mean he he helped organize it to say that if you want to come to a state where you have more freedom

972
01:43:15,740 --> 01:43:20,860
and lower taxes and more liberties come to texas and bring your rifle and your ammunition i thought

973
01:43:20,860 --> 01:43:26,380
it was fantastic what are your thoughts on mr abbott's actions in regard to that publicity

974
01:43:26,380 --> 01:43:30,940
i mean i hit on that last night when i was on hannity and and i had a very close friend of mine

975
01:43:30,940 --> 01:43:35,980
that saw the interview and he said if you'll get my resume martyred nile packer backs tomorrow

976
01:43:36,620 --> 01:43:41,420
and and you know the reality here's the reality it's not just like as the governor told john

977
01:43:42,380 --> 01:43:46,620
you're not going to be 15 off better simply because there are no state income taxes

978
01:43:46,620 --> 01:43:54,780
our standard our cost of living is is is 30 lower yes so for those of you that aren't here yet

979
01:43:54,780 --> 01:44:00,860
i i grew up in upstate new york i moved here in 1997 because i believed in my heart of hearts

980
01:44:00,860 --> 01:44:06,860
this is the best place to raise my family and the people of texas have welcomed us and made a home

981
01:44:06,860 --> 01:44:13,020
for us yes and uh i'm just going to tell you the quality of the living will be twice as good and

982
01:44:13,020 --> 01:44:17,740
the cost of living will be a third of what you're paying anywhere else absolutely that's that's one

983
01:44:17,740 --> 01:44:22,620
of the reasons i'm here and plus i just just love the liberty and i love i am proud of being in

984
01:44:22,620 --> 01:44:28,060
texas and knowing that texas has people like you mr toath and people like mr abbott who i i hear

985
01:44:28,060 --> 01:44:33,340
has aims maybe for the governorship which maybe he'd be the perfect person to do that down the

986
01:44:33,340 --> 01:44:39,180
road when that opportunity arises but i am just proud to be in a state that says we we have

987
01:44:39,180 --> 01:44:43,900
liberty here and we're going to stand for it we are going to stand up against tyranny we're going

988
01:44:43,900 --> 01:44:49,980
to pass the laws that nullify unconstitutional orders we are texans and we're not laying down

989
01:44:49,980 --> 01:44:56,140
for a bunch of tyrants i love that attitude we've got i mean yeah but we need to hear from all of

990
01:44:56,140 --> 01:45:01,900
you i mean and let the phones ring right now call general abbott's office and let him know that

991
01:45:01,900 --> 01:45:07,020
you're going to get behind the firearms protection act yes let him hear it he needs to hear from you

992
01:45:07,020 --> 01:45:15,740
guys um they want to be about this isn't this isn't a lack of leadership this is they want to

993
01:45:15,740 --> 01:45:21,020
hear from the people they need the people to be heard they want to hear from you guys which one

994
01:45:21,020 --> 01:45:25,660
of these bills do you want something more more moderate they'll support something more moderate

995
01:45:25,660 --> 01:45:32,220
but if they hear from the grassroots of texas that they want to build with teeth in it then

996
01:45:32,220 --> 01:45:37,100
then tell the tell the attorney general's office that that you're going to stand behind the firearms

997
01:45:37,100 --> 01:45:42,220
protection act and you want him to as well respectfully because he's a good man exactly

998
01:45:42,220 --> 01:45:47,740
yeah and and that's the message all of you out there who are tired of being oppressed and having

999
01:45:47,740 --> 01:45:53,020
your rights eroded by executive orders or the federal government in whatever way and there's

1000
01:45:53,020 --> 01:45:57,260
a lot of this happening in agriculture too with the the food safety modernization act that just

1001
01:45:57,260 --> 01:46:03,100
hammers small farmers in texas as well i've even covered that the time can i share another one

1002
01:46:03,100 --> 01:46:08,540
yeah sure go ahead please there is there is a terrible curriculum going through the schools

1003
01:46:08,540 --> 01:46:14,700
today it's called cisco it is an 80 of the schools across the state of texas parents are not allowed

1004
01:46:14,700 --> 01:46:21,900
to view it they're not allowed to go online to look at it's a portal online um curriculum parents

1005
01:46:21,900 --> 01:46:27,340
are not allowed to look at it teachers are are forced to find non-disclosure agreements about

1006
01:46:27,340 --> 01:46:35,100
what's in it really it's filled with islam um it is it is a it is it is the worst of the worst of

1007
01:46:35,100 --> 01:46:41,420
the worst when where did this come from well it's it started with um here's the problem when you

1008
01:46:41,420 --> 01:46:45,580
start a government agency you can't kill it so we have these education service centers in the state

1009
01:46:45,580 --> 01:46:51,420
of texas that 20 30 years ago when we're in when we're in school and you wanted to film strip or

1010
01:46:51,420 --> 01:46:56,860
you wanted a 16 millimeter movie you would go to the education service center where they they they

1011
01:46:56,860 --> 01:47:01,500
were you know the balls basically for all the equipment and all these great films and slides

1012
01:47:01,500 --> 01:47:05,260
and everything else but we don't need that anymore because we have this thing called the internet the

1013
01:47:05,260 --> 01:47:09,820
streaming video and audio and all that cool stuff we get it over we get it over the internet yeah

1014
01:47:09,820 --> 01:47:16,540
so like any good government agency it became a solution in search of a problem and so what they

1015
01:47:16,540 --> 01:47:21,020
did was they came out with this thing called cisco they spent millions of dollars of taxpayers money

1016
01:47:21,020 --> 01:47:27,740
on it and um it's it's not under the guise it's not under the supervision auspices of the state

1017
01:47:27,740 --> 01:47:32,940
board of education these liberals that are running it can basically say and do anything that they

1018
01:47:32,940 --> 01:47:37,660
want without the approval of the state board of education who are elected by we the people but

1019
01:47:37,660 --> 01:47:42,700
you see that's their attack point now is to try to indoctrinate the next generation it is exactly

1020
01:47:42,700 --> 01:47:46,380
what they're trying to do and with all these tv shows too that are coming out i don't know how

1021
01:47:46,380 --> 01:47:51,900
much you're aware of those but this show about they hate paul revere and a show demonizing the

1022
01:47:51,900 --> 01:47:58,460
founding fathers and most of these shows get this our founding the tea party the boston tea party

1023
01:47:59,260 --> 01:48:05,500
they're referred to in c scope as terrorists oh man yeah not surprising well they're going for

1024
01:48:05,500 --> 01:48:10,540
broke mr toad they're going for broke this is this is texas yeah yeah they're they're trying

1025
01:48:10,540 --> 01:48:14,780
to turn any person who just believes in the constitution and the founding fathers into a

1026
01:48:14,780 --> 01:48:20,060
total outright terrorist i mean that's right it's now in our faces there can no longer be any doubt

1027
01:48:20,060 --> 01:48:25,020
they're not beating around the bush so to speak they're going for your freedoms just outright

1028
01:48:25,820 --> 01:48:32,300
oh man unbelievable so unbelievable mr toad i let me ask you a question on different track

we're continuing here on the alex jones show thank you for joining us we just finished up an

1090
01:54:18,220 --> 01:54:22,700
interview with representative steve toath from the state of texas and the firearms protection act and

1091
01:54:22,700 --> 01:54:29,180
i want to reiterate why this matters to everybody across the nation and wherever you may be listening

1092
01:54:29,180 --> 01:54:34,860
from this is a precedent-setting bill and it's based on the bill out of wyoming and that really

1093
01:54:34,860 --> 01:54:39,980
that the author of that bill deserves the credit but the language of this bill can be shared with

1094
01:54:39,980 --> 01:54:44,780
many other states and there are lots of other states who would like to get on board and stand

1095
01:54:44,780 --> 01:54:49,580
up to the federal government and say enough is enough we're not going to let our rights be

1096
01:54:49,580 --> 01:54:56,060
trampled on any longer because look where this is going folks if you don't stand up to this

1097
01:54:57,580 --> 01:55:00,940
second amendment is not the end of this they're going to come after your first amendment they're

1098
01:55:00,940 --> 01:55:04,940
going to come after your fifth amendment even more than they have already they're going to

1099
01:55:04,940 --> 01:55:10,300
obliterate states rights and basically say there shouldn't be any states whatsoever and with the

1100
01:55:10,300 --> 01:55:14,940
executive orders obama is going to be saying well we don't need congress either what's the point of

1101
01:55:14,940 --> 01:55:22,540
having congress when the president just writes law this is the basis of the downfall of our

1102
01:55:22,540 --> 01:55:28,140
free society and it has already begun we are we have already started to tumble down that pit

1103
01:55:28,140 --> 01:55:34,140
of tyranny and oppression and if we don't turn back from that right now it's over this is this

1104
01:55:34,140 --> 01:55:39,660
is it so you better get on the phone right now if you're in the state of texas you better get on the

1105
01:55:39,660 --> 01:55:46,380
phone call attorney general greg abbott's office and tell him yes you support the full the full-on

1106
01:55:46,380 --> 01:55:52,540
firearms protection act that makes it a felony for federal officials to engage in unconstitutional

1107
01:55:52,540 --> 01:55:57,340
gun restriction in the state of texas you better call your state representatives wherever you live

1108
01:55:57,340 --> 01:56:01,660
and tell them introduce the firearms protection act because if you don't if you don't draw the

1109
01:56:01,660 --> 01:56:07,020
line right here it's over and let me tell you my personal prediction of what i think is coming up

1110
01:56:07,020 --> 01:56:16,860
so why why didn't obama have a high-capacity magazine restriction in his executive orders

1111
01:56:17,740 --> 01:56:22,700
there was all this talk that he was going to do that but he backed off it seems he did not do that

1112
01:56:22,700 --> 01:56:27,500
why because he has full confidence that they're going to be able to get that through congress

1113
01:56:27,500 --> 01:56:32,780
through legislation so you have to ask the question then why does he have that confidence

1114
01:56:32,780 --> 01:56:42,700
when right now the the mood the the environment in congress is saying no to more gun restrictions

1115
01:56:42,700 --> 01:56:49,340
in congress why does he have that confidence the answer is because they are planning another major

1116
01:56:49,340 --> 01:56:57,900
false flag attack in america a major false flag attack and i'm here to tell you independently

1117
01:56:57,900 --> 01:57:04,860
independently at not even not even based on what alex said or infowars or anybody else but just

1118
01:57:04,860 --> 01:57:11,660
myself as mike adams as an intelligent investigative journalist with no criminal record absolutely you

1119
01:57:11,660 --> 01:57:16,700
know the cleanest cut guy you'll ever meet i don't smoke i don't drink alcohol i never have

1120
01:57:16,700 --> 01:57:21,820
a consumed alcohol just my personal choice clean cut guy super clean record passed all the fbi

1121
01:57:21,820 --> 01:57:26,940
background checks all the atf checks you know for class four gear you name it all right you're not

1122
01:57:26,940 --> 01:57:32,300
going to find somebody with with a cleaner record than myself by looking at the data i am telling

1123
01:57:32,300 --> 01:57:39,340
you i believe that they are going to stage another major false flag attack during the debate of gun

1124
01:57:39,340 --> 01:57:45,500
control restrictions in the u.s congress because they know that if they stage something big enough

1125
01:57:45,500 --> 01:57:50,540
and i'm talking about something like blowing up federal buildings more than what we saw in

1126
01:57:50,540 --> 01:57:57,900
oklahoma city something even perhaps bigger than 911 i'm talking about perhaps them doing a a dirty

1127
01:57:57,900 --> 01:58:04,620
bomb a radiological attack or a biological attack in a major u.s city and somehow finding some way

1128
01:58:04,620 --> 01:58:12,140
to blame that on patriots that's what is coming so you better be ready because if they do that and

1129
01:58:12,140 --> 01:58:17,740

1146
02:00:27,660 --> 02:00:33,820
filling in for alex and i appreciate you joining us today we've got so much on our plates things

1147
02:00:33,820 --> 02:00:38,860
are moving very very rapidly now coming up in the next segment we've got dr andrew wakefield

1148
02:00:38,860 --> 02:00:44,940
joining us here live in studio here in austin texas to give us the latest information on the

1149
02:00:44,940 --> 02:00:52,140
u.s vaccine court admitting that vaccines cause autism plus we're going to get dr wakefield's

1150
02:00:52,140 --> 02:00:59,260
take on the new psychiatric police state that has just been formed in america by obama and his 23

1151
02:00:59,260 --> 02:01:04,300
executive orders there was an outstanding breakdown of those executive orders posted

1152
02:01:04,300 --> 02:01:09,180
filmed and posted by aaron dykes right here on the infowars team just i think yesterday or the

1153
02:01:09,180 --> 02:01:14,460
night before that went up seven of the 23 executive orders have something to do with mental health

1154
02:01:14,460 --> 02:01:19,660
so you can bet they're going to start using psychiatry as a weapon against freedom while

1155
02:01:19,660 --> 02:01:24,460
completely ignoring the fact that psychiatry actually creates violent shooters and has been

1156
02:01:24,460 --> 02:01:30,140
linked to most of these shootings that have taken place so wow what a what a total scam a total

1157
02:01:30,140 --> 02:01:36,220
racket they're making the problem worse while ignoring the real causes of violence in america

1158
02:01:36,220 --> 02:01:43,260
today two things i wanted to cover though real quick before we bring dr wakefield in studio one

1159
02:01:43,260 --> 02:01:48,060
is that you know you've got obama and all these people talking about background checks that we

1160
02:01:48,060 --> 02:01:53,740
need to have universal background checks why not have universal background checks for presidents

1161
02:01:54,460 --> 02:01:59,340
because let me tell you this you know that obama's birth certificate has i don't know

1162
02:01:59,340 --> 02:02:06,380
17 layers in adobe acrobat it's it's copied and pasted and the resolution is different in

1163
02:02:06,380 --> 02:02:11,020
different parts of the document the thing is a total fake it's so obvious anybody who knows

1164
02:02:11,020 --> 02:02:18,460
photoshop or acrobat can see that his birth certificate is a fake now if you or i submitted

1165
02:02:18,460 --> 02:02:23,740
a document like that as part of a background check to purchase a gun we would be arrested

1166
02:02:23,740 --> 02:02:29,420
for document fraud we would be guilty of a felony crime for submitting the same type of document

1167
02:02:29,420 --> 02:02:34,460
which is an obvious fraud that the president of our country is using the claim that he's qualified

1168
02:02:34,460 --> 02:02:41,580
to be president or that he that he uh meets the constitutional requirements so why not have

1169
02:02:41,580 --> 02:02:47,740
universal background checks for presidents for his cabinet members why not have background checks

1170
02:02:47,740 --> 02:02:52,780
for members of congress to make sure they can pass a quiz on the constitution you know what is

1171
02:02:52,780 --> 02:02:58,460
what is the 10th amendment ask your average congressperson in washington dc and they won't

1172
02:02:58,460 --> 02:03:02,540
know they don't know what it is or they'll misquote it they'll say oh the 10th amendment is

1173
02:03:02,540 --> 02:03:08,940
what gives the government the right to regulate all intrastate commerce what what that's not

1174
02:03:08,940 --> 02:03:13,500
what's written at all you people would fail you get an f okay you get an f on liberty and f on

1175
02:03:13,500 --> 02:03:18,620
the constitution you get an f in washington on just about everything you're doing today except

1176
02:03:18,620 --> 02:03:24,220
those few people that are standing up and a big thumbs up to rand paul by the way for his comments

1177
02:03:24,220 --> 02:03:30,700
on saying that we don't want a king in america today it's we've had enough of kings running our

1178
02:03:30,700 --> 02:03:37,260
lives so enough of the kingship one other comment here before we get into the next segment

1179
02:03:38,220 --> 02:03:44,060
lance armstrong uh i i wrote an article about lance armstrong it's posted on infowars.com right

1180
02:03:44,060 --> 02:03:50,620

1182
02:03:57,580 --> 02:04:04,300

1183
02:04:04,300 --> 02:04:09,100
doped with his own blood injecting it back into his veins i mean that guy was not on a bike unless

1184

1185
02:04:16,060 --> 02:04:21,100
those races and in the interview he didn't even think that it was cheating he just said oh it's

1186
02:04:21,100 --> 02:04:25,980
just leveling the playing field i mean the guy has no remorse he bullied people he threatened

1187
02:04:25,980 --> 02:04:32,220
people he filed lawsuits against a long list of whistleblowers who were trying to speak out and

1188
02:04:32,220 --> 02:04:38,220
now he goes on oprah and wants us to forgive him dude we don't forgive you why don't you give the

1227
02:09:05,820 --> 02:09:18,300
the handsome criminals for many of the police and guard troops it is an uncomfortable job to do this

all right welcome back to the alex jones show this is mike adams the editor of naturalnews.com

1232
02:09:46,140 --> 02:09:52,860
filling in for alex today and in studio joining me now for the rest of this hour is none other than

1233
02:09:52,860 --> 02:09:59,420
dr andrew wakefield with some breaking news on the u.s vaccine court and its recent decision tying

1234
02:09:59,420 --> 02:10:04,860
vaccines to autism without any question whatsoever so he'll be breaking that down for us in some

1235
02:10:04,860 --> 02:10:11,260
detail also we're going to get dr wakefield's take on some of the possible implications of

1236
02:10:11,260 --> 02:10:16,780
the recent executive orders focused on mental health and psychiatry and i've even got a copy

1237
02:10:16,780 --> 02:10:24,300
of the psychiatry bible so to speak here with me and we're going to cover oppositional defiance

1238
02:10:24,300 --> 02:10:31,260
disorder odd which is actually in the psychiatry manual even though people said i made that up

1239
02:10:31,260 --> 02:10:35,340
i didn't make it up and i'm going to show it to you in the book as we continue here plus we're

1240
02:10:35,340 --> 02:10:40,780
going to be taking your calls so if you've got a question for dr wakefield i'd like to take your

1241
02:10:40,780 --> 02:10:48,860
call go ahead and call it's 888 isn't it no 800 i'm sorry 800-259-9231 if you've got a question

1242
02:10:48,860 --> 02:10:55,820
on psychiatry or dr wakefield if you called earlier for paul watson's guest or representative

1243
02:10:55,820 --> 02:11:01,740
toath i'm gonna have to drop you and and take new calls on psychiatry and questions for dr wakefield

1244
02:11:01,740 --> 02:11:06,060
so go ahead and clear the board guys and let let new people call back in and i apologize if you're

1245
02:11:06,060 --> 02:11:11,260
on hold but you know things are moving very quickly so dr wakefield welcome to the alex jones

1246
02:11:11,260 --> 02:11:15,900
show it's good to have you in studio again it's great to be back thank you well a lot has been

1247
02:11:15,900 --> 02:11:22,780
happening since the last time we spoke right here in the same spot you've got the the british medical

1248
02:11:22,780 --> 02:11:28,540
journal still has not retracted their slanderous statements about you and your research is there

1249
02:11:28,540 --> 02:11:34,300
any update on that front yes brian dear and the editor of the british medical journal and the bmj

1250
02:11:34,300 --> 02:11:38,940
themselves are being sued here in the state of texas we're going through a jurisdictional battle

1251
02:11:38,940 --> 02:11:43,740
at the moment they're saying you don't have the right to sue us here in texas this is a british

1252
02:11:43,740 --> 02:11:50,380
journal these this is a british journalist but we do there's a long arm statute and they sell their

1253
02:11:50,380 --> 02:11:55,340
wares and make a profit out of texas so um on the technical aspects of this we're confident in

1254
02:11:55,340 --> 02:12:00,940
winning and getting brian dear here before a texas jury and that is the key really brian dear might

1255
02:12:00,940 --> 02:12:06,700
be here in austin texas that is what this is all about i want the american people to see and judge

1256
02:12:06,700 --> 02:12:11,500
this man for themselves and to judge the quality and the veracity of his story and they will see

1257
02:12:11,500 --> 02:12:17,100
how flawed he really is or he could just remain a fugitive from justice i guess and refuse to come

1258
02:12:17,100 --> 02:12:21,980
and and what you might have to go into extradition proceedings in the uk or how would that even work

1259
02:12:21,980 --> 02:12:25,020
well it's interesting and it's probably a technical aspect of law but i would imagine

1260
02:12:25,020 --> 02:12:30,540
that we would then file a case in england and he would then be in contempt of the uk courts but

1261
02:12:30,540 --> 02:12:35,180
that's another matter the the bmj themselves have to come because they sell here this is

1262
02:12:35,180 --> 02:12:40,380
one of their outlets so um they have they're obliged if we win the jurisdictional battle

1263
02:12:40,380 --> 02:12:46,060
well excellent i appreciate your veracity your dedication to pursuing this and not allowing them

1264
02:12:46,060 --> 02:12:51,340
to just steamroll you with their slanderous completely false analysis i mean they they

1265
02:12:51,340 --> 02:12:56,780
literally just invented things about your research that they pulled out of thin air yeah i know what

1266
02:12:56,780 --> 02:13:01,180
the problem here mike is so much bigger as you probably know there is a an increasing level of

1267
02:13:01,180 --> 02:13:07,180
attack on scientists and physicians who are acting in the best interests of their patients and not in

1268
02:13:07,180 --> 02:13:11,820
the best interests of the government or the pharmaceutical industry and there is a relentless

1269
02:13:11,820 --> 02:13:16,940
assault on the few perhaps five ten scientists in the world who are prepared to work on the possible

1270
02:13:16,940 --> 02:13:23,020
association between vaccines and childhood developmental disorders like autism and if we do

1271
02:13:23,020 --> 02:13:27,340
not protect those scientists and doctors then you're going to find nobody who's prepared to

1272
02:13:27,340 --> 02:13:30,700
stand up in vaccine court to protect these children because that's the end of their career

1273
02:13:30,700 --> 02:13:35,260
you're going to find no scientist who's prepared to do the valid safety science on vaccines because

1274
02:13:35,260 --> 02:13:39,340
it'll be the end of their career they lose their grants they'll lose everything just as i did and

1275
02:13:39,340 --> 02:13:45,420
so we have got to stand up as a body as scientists as a community as a people and say these people

1276
02:13:45,420 --> 02:13:48,700
are valuable and need to be protected and that is exactly what we're doing well said this is

1277
02:13:48,700 --> 02:13:54,700
about the integrity of science i mean this is you know this is not a personal uh a revenge

1278
02:13:54,700 --> 02:13:59,100
attack on brandy that's it's so much more important than that and the community actually

1279
02:13:59,100 --> 02:14:04,380
said to me andy we need to fight this case we will raise the capital to help you because as you know

1280
02:14:04,380 --> 02:14:11,020
mike justice belongs to those who can afford it yes so we need to take this battle to them in the

1281
02:14:11,020 --> 02:14:16,460
u.s court well let's talk about the u.s vaccine court now also there's been significant breaking

1282
02:14:16,460 --> 02:14:22,540
news that you brought to my attention an article published at huffpost vaccine court awards millions

1283
02:14:22,540 --> 02:14:29,580
to two children with autism the court has made the determination that there is a causal link

1284
02:14:29,580 --> 02:14:34,460
between vaccinations and the development of autism in those children and they were given an award

1285
02:14:34,460 --> 02:14:38,860
give us a breakdown of that story well it's this is fascinating it's huge it's a game changer and

1286
02:14:38,860 --> 02:14:43,340
it comes on the back of an italian decision in the remedy court which made an identical decision here

1287
02:14:43,340 --> 02:14:47,580
we have a child who was developing perfectly normally in italy who had the mmr and regressed

1288
02:14:47,580 --> 02:14:51,580
into autism he developed all the typical characteristics that we described originally

1289
02:14:51,580 --> 02:14:56,860
in lancet including gastrointestinal symptoms encephalopathy in other words generalized brain

1290
02:14:56,860 --> 02:15:02,780
dysfunction and his final diagnosis was autism they settled that case in italy the government

1291
02:15:02,780 --> 02:15:08,860
importantly did not fight it they agreed that the mmr had caused his autism they thought it on the

1292
02:15:08,860 --> 02:15:16,060
basis that they do not make mmr vaccination mandatory in in italy whereas the judge said no sorry you

1293
02:15:16,060 --> 02:15:20,540
put so much pressure on parents to have this vaccine you are to blame now we have this ruling

1294
02:15:20,540 --> 02:15:25,740
in the u.s vaccine court where you have exactly the same sequence of events normally developing

1295
02:15:25,740 --> 02:15:32,940
children get the mmr plus another vaccine in each case of these two children they then regress into

1296
02:15:32,940 --> 02:15:38,860
they have this encephalopathy a rash of fever loss of language loss of speech loss of interaction

1297
02:15:38,860 --> 02:15:44,940
with their siblings and a regression into autism they are linked and what this brings to the public

1298
02:15:44,940 --> 02:15:51,180
attention once and for all is that the american uh vaccine court the department of justice have

1299
02:15:51,180 --> 02:15:57,580
been hiding behind the vaccine court for so long oh yeah take behind their table injuries now we

1300
02:15:57,580 --> 02:16:03,660
have a clear sequence of events which links vaccines mmr in particular to autism all right

1301
02:16:03,660 --> 02:16:08,940
if you're just joining us this is the alex jones show mike adams filling in an interview with dr

1302
02:16:08,940 --> 02:16:14,780
andrew wakefield live here in studio in austin texas and a lot of breaking news on the vaccine

1303
02:16:14,780 --> 02:16:21,580
front now we published a story not too long ago dr wakefield where the cdc admits on their website

1304
02:16:21,580 --> 02:16:26,700
and we you know took a screenshot quoted their information they admit that vaccines contain

1305
02:16:27,420 --> 02:16:37,020
mercury aluminum msg monosodium glutamate and formaldehyde now these four substances should any

1306
02:16:37,020 --> 02:16:44,220
doctor in any circumstance ever inject a child with aluminum mercury msg or formaldehyde

1307
02:16:44,220 --> 02:16:47,580
no it would be unthinkable if you took these substances on their own and gave them to someone

1308
02:16:47,580 --> 02:16:52,460
you would be you would face criminal prosecution and yet right they're saying that this is safe no

1309
02:16:52,460 --> 02:16:56,620
it isn't it's never been tested for safety we just got a a recent report from the institute of

1310
02:16:56,620 --> 02:17:01,500
medicine saying that there is a parlous lack of information on vaccine safety science both in

1311
02:17:01,500 --> 02:17:05,980
terms of the schedule of the dose that children get and when they get it we simply do not know

1312
02:17:05,980 --> 02:17:10,620
there is no science and so if people are telling the public that vaccines are safe because they've

1313
02:17:10,620 --> 02:17:16,540
been shown to be safe that is not true right right exactly but brings up the question why

1314
02:17:16,540 --> 02:17:24,780
won't the cdc the fda and the the pro vaccine doctors out there why won't they say let's make

1315
02:17:24,780 --> 02:17:31,180
a clean vaccine let's make clean vaccines with no mercury no thimerosal no msg no formaldehyde

1316
02:17:31,180 --> 02:17:36,460
nothing like just single dose vials right so they don't need a preservative because they're

1317
02:17:36,460 --> 02:17:41,500
not used for multiple doses why won't they do that there are two parts to this answer mike in

1318
02:17:41,500 --> 02:17:45,980
my opinion and one of them is accountability if you make a change then it's a tacit admission

1319
02:17:45,980 --> 02:17:49,580
that there was a problem with the vaccine that you had before so they'd rather keep harming

1320
02:17:49,580 --> 02:17:53,180
children rather than fix the problem that seems to be the case and the other problem mike is that

1321
02:17:53,180 --> 02:17:58,060
they don't want to lose the public to lose confidence the vaccine schedule the vaccine

1322
02:17:58,060 --> 02:18:02,540
policy of any country depends upon the compliance of the populace in other words people having

1323
02:18:02,540 --> 02:18:08,380
enough confidence in the vaccine regulators to say yes we'll take your your word for it and if

1324
02:18:08,380 --> 02:18:12,620
that goes then it's it's to try to cross the board you know people will lose confidence in vaccines

1325
02:18:12,620 --> 02:18:17,980
right across the board and we will have problems well they are they are losing confidence in

1326
02:18:17,980 --> 02:18:24,380
vaccines no mike they've lost it they've lost 89 percent of american parents in a recent study from

1327
02:18:24,380 --> 02:18:29,260
uh university of michigan said the vaccine safety science was their number one medical research

1328
02:18:29,260 --> 02:18:35,020
priority 89 of parents wow so the majority of parents have major concerns they do not believe

1329
02:18:35,020 --> 02:18:39,020
the cdc they do not believe what their pediatrician is telling them they're saying in their in their

1330
02:18:39,020 --> 02:18:43,740
communities on their streets in their schools so many children who are being damaged by these

1331
02:18:43,740 --> 02:18:49,020
vaccines with autism at the sort of spearhead of all this that they do not believe what they're

1332
02:18:49,020 --> 02:18:53,100
being old and it's obvious that they damage children i mean i remember even donald trump

1333
02:18:53,100 --> 02:18:58,140
said on the air a couple of months ago that his employees perfectly healthy children took them

1334
02:18:58,140 --> 02:19:04,460
into the pediatrician they got vaccinated the next morning lights are out the child's autistic

1335
02:19:04,460 --> 02:19:11,260
and it happens to people over and over and over again there is a temporal correlation between

1336
02:19:11,260 --> 02:19:16,300
getting the vaccine and getting autism how can the scientific community even call itself scientific

1337
02:19:16,300 --> 02:19:22,860
if it dismisses all of this powerful evidence it is extraordinary to me clinically it is so obvious

1338
02:19:22,860 --> 02:19:27,980
my job as a physician and a scientist is to look for patterns in disease patterns in clinical

1339
02:19:27,980 --> 02:19:33,900
presentation and the pattern here is so common so similar and it's exactly as you heard in these

1340
02:19:33,900 --> 02:19:40,700
court settlements normal child vaccine prolonged fever rash debilitation the child goes downhill

1341
02:19:40,700 --> 02:19:44,380
their immune system goes to pieces all right hold on never the same again hold that thought

1342
02:19:44,380 --> 02:19:48,380

all right and we are back on the alex jones show thank you for joining us

1385
02:24:21,980 --> 02:24:29,020
we are continuing our interview here in studio with dr andrew wakefield yes the dr wakefield

1386
02:24:29,020 --> 02:24:34,300
the champion of academic integrity when it comes to on scientific integrity actually more importantly

1387
02:24:34,300 --> 02:24:39,100
when it comes to vaccines and investigating with a sense of scientific skepticism

1388
02:24:39,740 --> 02:24:45,100
what could be the links between vaccines and childhood development disorders such as autism

1389
02:24:45,100 --> 02:24:50,220
but not limited to autism and dr wakefield continues with us in the studio right now dr

1390
02:24:50,220 --> 02:24:56,620
wakefield what kinds of i i want to get the word out about how people can help support your efforts

1391
02:24:56,620 --> 02:25:00,460
because this is an important victory and you mentioned a website during the break can you

1392
02:25:00,460 --> 02:25:04,860
give that out on the air certainly in order to protect doctors and scientists who are acting in

1393
02:25:04,860 --> 02:25:10,460
the interests of their patients but who are being attacked by what is whatever mainstream medicine

1394
02:25:10,460 --> 02:25:15,740
is by the pharmaceutical industry by the media because they are not complying with the rules

1395
02:25:16,460 --> 02:25:20,940
that protect the stock price of of various pharmaceutical products then what we've done

1396
02:25:20,940 --> 02:25:26,940
is to set up what we call the academic integrity fund academic integrity fund.org and this

1397
02:25:26,940 --> 02:25:31,740
is a fund that people can pay into which will protect the legal rights will allow the

1398
02:25:31,740 --> 02:25:35,980
people who are coming under attack to fight back whether it's in the courts or elsewhere

1399
02:25:35,980 --> 02:25:39,820
and it's starting with my case right here in texas in an attempt to get brian deere and the

1400
02:25:39,820 --> 02:25:45,820
british medical journal in front of a texas jury and are there are i know it takes money to fight

1401
02:25:45,820 --> 02:25:51,660
for justice big time is are there some attorneys also doing some pro bono work as part of it or

1402
02:25:51,660 --> 02:25:56,620
discounted work i have an outstanding group of attorneys who are working at a discounted rate

1403
02:25:57,340 --> 02:26:01,660
because they believe very strongly in the merits of this case well i'm going to make a donation

1404
02:26:01,660 --> 02:26:06,380
by the way i've been doing a lot of donations lately i donated to gun owners of america

1405
02:26:06,380 --> 02:26:11,580
i gave 500 to that group i just larry pratt you rock i gave him 500 bucks i'm going to donate to

1406
02:26:11,580 --> 02:26:17,180
your group academic integrity fund.org is the web address we've got to put the money where it

1407
02:26:17,180 --> 02:26:23,100
matters i call that uh revenue activism so we take money from our store sales and we just push it

1408
02:26:23,100 --> 02:26:27,420
into all these things that need support but uh thank you for mentioning that website but

1409
02:26:27,420 --> 02:26:33,580
continuing on what do you think about this flu so-called flu pandemic almost a fear-mongering

1410
02:26:33,580 --> 02:26:38,460
thing the cdc is doing right now saying oh the flu is terrible everybody should go get vaccinated

1411
02:26:38,460 --> 02:26:43,500
isn't that a too simplistic of an answer we've seen this time and time again mike and i'm not

1412
02:26:43,500 --> 02:26:48,860
an expert on flu vaccine but i do know that for example flu mutates at a phenomenally fast rate

1413
02:26:48,860 --> 02:26:53,100
so predicting which vaccine is going to work against the current flu is such a hit and miss

1414
02:26:53,100 --> 02:26:59,020
affair and we've seen from analyses detailed comprehensive scientific analyses of all the data

1415
02:26:59,020 --> 02:27:03,980
on flu vaccine around the world in the cochran review that these vaccines are their their

1416
02:27:03,980 --> 02:27:09,020
benefit is minimal at best and restricted to certain groups not seen in high-risk groups

1417
02:27:09,020 --> 02:27:13,420
and therefore there is no merit in those high-risk groups getting them and the canadians showing

1418
02:27:13,420 --> 02:27:18,380
that if you get the flu after being vaccinated because it does not work well then it is worse

1419
02:27:18,380 --> 02:27:24,780
you develop a more severe pattern of disease but you have been vaccinated the cdc which i am

1420
02:27:24,780 --> 02:27:30,700
convinced just invents numbers out of thin air i mean they just pull these out of their hats and

1421
02:27:30,700 --> 02:27:35,340
they they say if you get the vaccine your flu will be less severe but they have absolutely

1422
02:27:35,340 --> 02:27:40,940
no data to back that up and they say the vaccine is now i think they're quoting it's 62 effective

1423
02:27:40,940 --> 02:27:45,500
that number has no basis in anything they make it up i'm sure they do and they have the ability to

1424
02:27:45,500 --> 02:27:52,140
make a sows ear out of a silk purse i think that's what they've done here they've made numbers up

1425
02:27:52,140 --> 02:27:55,980
for so long what are we to believe and when you hear these numbers about the people who've

1426
02:27:55,980 --> 02:28:00,140
had to go to the hospital because they've got flu how many of those people were vaccinated

1427
02:28:00,140 --> 02:28:04,380
were they part of those group that group that the canadians say exactly are going to be worse if they

1428
02:28:04,380 --> 02:28:08,460
get the flu after having been vaccinated we don't know we're not told i did a little bit of a survey

1429
02:28:08,460 --> 02:28:14,140
on that and i found that about two-thirds in my group of you know friends and employees and so on

1430
02:28:14,140 --> 02:28:20,220
about two-thirds of the people who went to the hospital with influenza i'm not talking about my

1431
02:28:20,220 --> 02:28:24,380
employees they're they're typically healthy but people they know you know two-thirds of them have

1432
02:28:24,380 --> 02:28:30,940
been vaccinated against the flu so how can that be if the flu works i mean if the flu vaccine

1433
02:28:30,940 --> 02:28:35,100
works then how can two-thirds of the people in the hospital with the flu be people who got

1434
02:28:35,100 --> 02:28:41,500
vaccinated it's not logical yeah there's something very bad going wrong here and the idea that you're

1435
02:28:41,500 --> 02:28:46,780
going to give mercury containing flu vaccines to pregnant women and to children over the age of

1436
02:28:46,780 --> 02:28:53,980
six months this is unacceptable tell me about when you were trained in med school weren't you taught

1437
02:28:53,980 --> 02:28:58,300
never give a vaccine to a pregnant woman absolutely i mean it was you never gave anything

1438
02:28:58,300 --> 02:29:02,300
to a pregnant woman unless absolutely necessary you know you've no antidepressants absolutely

1439
02:29:02,300 --> 02:29:06,380
you've got a very very vulnerable fetus there a lot of these compounds are sequestered they're

1440
02:29:06,380 --> 02:29:10,540
taken up preferentially into the fetus the fetus does not have the ability to get rid of them for

1441
02:29:10,540 --> 02:29:15,260
example mercury if you give a mother mercury that mercury is going to be uh is going to get into the

1442
02:29:15,260 --> 02:29:19,340
fetus and it cannot it doesn't have the excretion mechanisms to get rid of it so it's going to

1443
02:29:19,340 --> 02:29:24,780
accumulate but the cdc and the vaccine pushers they engage in what i might call magical thinking

1444
02:29:24,780 --> 02:29:29,020
where they say the mercury doesn't harm you because we say it doesn't we wave a magic wand

1445
02:29:29,020 --> 02:29:34,460
we do a little voodoo big pharma profit voodoo and suddenly the mercury is safe magical so they've

1446
02:29:34,460 --> 02:29:39,340
said the science shows that the science is in two years ago the paper came out showing that 74 of

1447
02:29:39,340 --> 02:29:43,660
the published science shows that there is an association between heavy metal containing

1448
02:29:43,660 --> 02:29:47,100

1490
02:33:53,180 --> 02:33:59,740
well thank you you know there was a small uh health uh natural health company here that was

1491
02:33:59,740 --> 02:34:06,300
exposing all this information on a daily basis and the ftcs went after them it was called daniel

1492
02:34:06,300 --> 02:34:11,580
chapter one and basically if yeah they attacked their first amendment rights and and if they were

1493
02:34:11,580 --> 02:34:15,980
to say anything about this anymore they're basically going to put them in prison so they're

1494
02:34:15,980 --> 02:34:20,300
they ended their radio program you know we need the support of the people that's the problem

1495
02:34:21,020 --> 02:34:25,580
is they're attacked they're killing the messenger you know they're going after the messenger

1496
02:34:25,580 --> 02:34:29,820
and they're doing it i mean the federal trade commission is who went after them not the well

1497
02:34:29,820 --> 02:34:34,460
not the not the cdc yeah no i'm very familiar with that case that's a good point uh daniel

1498
02:34:34,460 --> 02:34:41,580
chapter one was actually a ministry and they sold some cancer therapies herbal and they dared to go

1499
02:34:41,580 --> 02:34:46,300
on the air and to say that you know some of these herbs are mentioned in the bible and they you know

1500
02:34:46,300 --> 02:34:50,860
they they can actually help you heal from cancer and yeah the ftc came after them what do you see

1501
02:34:50,860 --> 02:34:55,100
happening dr wakefield and thank you caller for your call but what do you see happening with

1502
02:34:55,100 --> 02:35:02,460
attacks on the first amendment rights of people who are attempting to to raise awareness among the

1503
02:35:02,460 --> 02:35:09,340
public of alternative or holistic healing therapies there are myriad cases of of local

1504
02:35:09,340 --> 02:35:15,340
health authorities local regulators going after alternative practitioners i mean these attacks

1505
02:35:15,340 --> 02:35:20,140
are going on all the time in fact texas is probably one of the worst states in the country

1506
02:35:20,140 --> 02:35:25,260
for that the state medical board absolutely yeah and dr brazinski absolutely a classic example

1507
02:35:26,140 --> 02:35:31,580
where i gather that they've now tried uh the fda are trying to get the patent on his products you

1508
02:35:31,580 --> 02:35:35,580
know having attacked him for years now that's what i've heard through the grapevine yeah whether it's

1509
02:35:35,580 --> 02:35:39,820
true or not it would be a wonderful irony to conclude that story as long as he comes out of it

1510
02:35:39,820 --> 02:35:48,460
um well well but um one of the greatest uh groups guilty of of bio biopiracy is big pharma they will

1511
02:35:48,460 --> 02:35:54,220
attack an herb and say it's useless it's useless it's useless and then they will steal a molecule

1512
02:35:54,220 --> 02:35:59,900
from that herb like turmeric for example they'll modify it patented and then say this is the best

1513
02:35:59,900 --> 02:36:04,300
drug ever oh yeah they're in the jungles now collecting a number of plants and herbs that

1514
02:36:04,860 --> 02:36:08,460
they believe may be the future to their success because they run out of other things apart from

1515
02:36:08,460 --> 02:36:15,180
vaccines to profit from um but uh the biggest impact i see is in the media you know here we

1516
02:36:15,180 --> 02:36:20,140
have a case where a classic case a groundbreaking case two cases where uh the the vaccine cord

1517
02:36:20,140 --> 02:36:25,740
awards uh for children who develop autism following mmr vaccine it's picked up by the uk

1518
02:36:25,740 --> 02:36:30,700
media it's reported they're not a single word in the mainstream media here why because their

1519
02:36:30,700 --> 02:36:37,020
revenues derived from advertising dollars from the pharmaceutical industry and that was a 1997

1520
02:36:37,020 --> 02:36:42,220
decision i believe from the fda that legalized pharmaceutical advertising on mainstream television

1521
02:36:42,220 --> 02:36:46,780
because before that it was illegal and it remains illegal in most every other nation around the

1522
02:36:46,780 --> 02:36:50,700
world and what they did mike is i think quite a smart thing is that they they paid a lot of money

1523
02:36:50,700 --> 02:36:55,500
and so that the the the media became dependent on that income you know it's like you kind of

1524
02:36:55,500 --> 02:36:59,820
ramp things up according to the income that you get and yeah you can't do without it and so

1525
02:36:59,820 --> 02:37:04,300
suddenly they've got them right where they want them got them got them yeah well we'll just leave

1526
02:37:04,300 --> 02:37:09,020
it at that all right let's go to the next call rob in texas you're on the air rob go ahead what's

1527
02:37:09,020 --> 02:37:14,140
your question sir well good afternoon gentlemen uh my statement actually speaks to psychiatric

1528
02:37:14,140 --> 02:37:20,620
psychiatric tyranny that i see and to vaccines um my son who is on the spectrum with asperger's was

1529
02:37:20,620 --> 02:37:26,380
vaccinated um he has depression and sometimes anger issues we take him to see a counselor we

1530
02:37:26,380 --> 02:37:32,860
were going to take him to see a child psychiatrist and so my wife was getting that set up he asked

1531
02:37:32,860 --> 02:37:38,300
sir you know do you have insurance she naively says well yes what kind okay we accept that she

1532
02:37:38,300 --> 02:37:43,420
goes but we want to pay for this out of pocket he says no you can't do that if we accept your

1533
02:37:43,420 --> 02:37:50,300
insurance they have to pay or it's insurance fraud this is new you can't pay cash no they

1534
02:37:50,300 --> 02:37:55,820
wouldn't let us pay cash needless to say we didn't book an appointment yeah well well good question

1535
02:37:55,820 --> 02:38:02,540
rob go ahead there's a big issue several big issues here actually one is um are the origins of

1536
02:38:02,540 --> 02:38:08,860
your child's anger and violence or aggressive issues due to um underlying pain or discomfort

1537
02:38:08,860 --> 02:38:13,020
one thing we've discovered in fact we reported years and years ago 15 years ago is these children

1538
02:38:13,020 --> 02:38:18,060
have an inflammatory bowel disease in many cases and that is a cause of gastrointestinal symptoms

1539
02:38:18,060 --> 02:38:23,500
constipation diarrhea alternating constipation and diarrhea pain kids in pain sudden outbursts of

1540
02:38:23,500 --> 02:38:27,340
anger and when you correct that abdominal inflammation that intestinal inflammation

1541
02:38:27,340 --> 02:38:33,420
all that goes away in other words is there a need for a reappraisal of children for medical

1542
02:38:33,420 --> 02:38:37,500
problems underlying medical problems do they not need to be on pharmaceutical agents for

1543
02:38:37,500 --> 02:38:43,580
uh for anger and depression at all and that's my belief very good source of problems yeah if

1544
02:38:43,580 --> 02:38:50,380
someone has chronic ongoing pain in digestive pain or even musculoskeletal pain whatever the

1545
02:38:50,380 --> 02:38:55,020
case may be you know they're going to be kind of crabby or maybe depressed in a bad mood that's

1546
02:38:55,020 --> 02:39:00,060
not a psychiatric problem that's a physiological problem it's absolutely essential to rule out

1547
02:39:00,060 --> 02:39:05,580
physiological medical problems before you resort to the belief that this is a psychiatric problem

1548
02:39:05,580 --> 02:39:10,540
and then put them on major medications which have may have any number of adverse effects and for

1549
02:39:10,540 --> 02:39:16,060
what we are not indicated for autism or asperger's disorders in these children so there may be an

1550
02:39:16,060 --> 02:39:21,260
alternative approach mike is it mike yeah no sorry no the man on the phone rob rob i thought

1551
02:39:21,260 --> 02:39:24,620
you're asking me my name yeah i'm mike what are you what you forgot me already what's going on

1552
02:39:26,220 --> 02:39:30,860
so rob if there are you know if there are any underlying symptoms that might be corrected please

1553
02:39:30,860 --> 02:39:35,820
bear that in mind and get take that approach first all right very good very good question rob thank

1554
02:39:35,820 --> 02:39:41,180
you for your call and by the way here over overhead cam shot this is the dsm right here

1555
02:39:41,180 --> 02:39:47,340
dsm for the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders the so-called bible of modern

1556
02:39:47,340 --> 02:39:55,660
psychiatry and check it out here it is page 100 oppositional defiant disorder oppositional defiant

1557
02:39:55,660 --> 02:40:01,500
disorder right here there we get in view check this out dr wakefield you can be diagnosed with

1558
02:40:01,500 --> 02:40:08,380
this and i imagine you and i have both been quote diagnosed with this by simply disagreeing with

1559
02:40:08,380 --> 02:40:13,580
someone in a position of authority it's just written right in here oh and they're probably

1560
02:40:13,580 --> 02:40:19,900
drugs that they can oh look often argues with adults something that's in the first amendment

1561
02:40:19,900 --> 02:40:24,620
i think that um often blames others for his or her mistakes well we don't do that but

1562
02:40:24,620 --> 02:40:29,820
uh easily annoyed by others i'm annoyed by liberals who are trying to take away our rights

1563
02:40:29,820 --> 02:40:35,660
i'm easily annoyed by gun grabbers uh i don't know i don't know who you're annoyed by uh journal

1564
02:40:35,660 --> 02:40:41,180
journal editors who slander how long have we got yeah well anyway there it is it's real folks uh

1565
02:40:41,180 --> 02:40:45,740
people said i made this up no it's right there and there are a couple of people it's right here

1566
02:40:45,740 --> 02:40:50,380
from it right in this room but i exactly i think that manual is it's it underlies everything that's

1567
02:40:50,380 --> 02:40:55,180
wrong with this disorder particularly autistic autistic spectrum disorders the worst thing

1568
02:40:55,180 --> 02:40:59,020
is that it ever firmed at the hands of child psychiatrists i'm afraid that's my opinion and

1569
02:40:59,020 --> 02:41:03,980
it's one i strongly strongly believe and what we see is a revision of this document time and time

1570
02:41:03,980 --> 02:41:08,540
again dsm when they should be focusing on the real issue what is driving this epidemic of autism for

1571
02:41:08,540 --> 02:41:13,100
a child born today the risk of an autistic spectrum disorder is going to be one in 25

1572
02:41:13,100 --> 02:41:17,420
that is unacceptable and when what you find is the psychiatric psychology community spend their time

1573
02:41:17,420 --> 02:41:22,380
revising this document not everyone yeah but a lot of people focus on this and it's a displacement

1574
02:41:22,380 --> 02:41:27,420
activity it's moving away from what is really essential about this how do you stop this epidemic

1575
02:41:27,420 --> 02:41:30,620
and how do you treat kids effectively you've already got it you know what this reminds me of

1576
02:41:30,620 --> 02:41:34,540
i mean look at this manual this thing is huge i mean check this out that's how big it is it's a

1577
02:41:34,540 --> 02:41:39,180
massive thick manual and it's getting bigger in version five all they do is they they they observe

1578
02:41:39,180 --> 02:41:42,700
a lot of nutritional deficiencies a lot of underlying problems and they give it a bunch of

1579
02:41:42,700 --> 02:41:48,060
different names this is like physicists looking for the god particle and naming all the little

1580
02:41:48,060 --> 02:41:51,820
things they spot in the super collider saying oh that's the muon that's the gluon that's the

1581
02:41:51,820 --> 02:41:56,940
blue on whatever they name it it's like no people it's there's there's one unified theory underneath

1582
02:41:56,940 --> 02:42:02,540
all this you're just naming things to try to make it sound scientific there's really only

1583
02:42:02,540 --> 02:42:08,700
a couple of basic core fundamental physiological truths or physical truths underneath all this

1584
02:42:08,700 --> 02:42:12,940
yeah one of the great truths mike is you go back and you talk to the mother what happened to your

1585
02:42:12,940 --> 02:42:17,020
child and mothers have got a trust in their instincts because their instincts are the reason

1586
02:42:17,020 --> 02:42:21,580
we're on this earth at the moment not the dsm manual so that can go in the trash all right let's

1587
02:42:21,580 --> 02:42:27,020
let's trash it there it goes off to the mother off and say what happened to your child very good

1588
02:42:27,020 --> 02:42:31,420
let's take another call i'm getting i'm getting excited here because i'm suffering from oppositional

1589
02:42:31,420 --> 02:42:36,780
defiant disorder jesse from new orleans you are on the air with dr andrew wakefield jesse welcome

1590
02:42:36,780 --> 02:42:43,740
to the show mike how you doing i'm doing great man so right in line with your conversation about

1591
02:42:43,740 --> 02:42:50,940
the dsm i was a victim of doctor uh doctors who basically use that book as their bible when i was

1592
02:42:50,940 --> 02:42:58,940
a kid i uh my my parents made me go see a therapist and uh i basically started making things up

1593
02:42:59,980 --> 02:43:04,860
based on what i was reading you know his diagnosis for certain things i actually read

1594
02:43:04,860 --> 02:43:11,340
a book about michael crayton's terminal man and uh basically just started telling him i was having

1595
02:43:11,340 --> 02:43:15,820
all the symptoms that the main character in that book had really and they completely took my word

1596
02:43:15,820 --> 02:43:23,820
for it so what were you diagnosed with psychiatrist who then gave me some medication and then they

1597
02:43:23,820 --> 02:43:28,380
inevitably i started telling him i was hearing voices even though i wasn't and because you know

1598
02:43:28,380 --> 02:43:36,300
i was 13 so they admitted me and by the time it was all said and done i was on well butrin when

1599
02:43:36,300 --> 02:43:42,860
it first came out depa coke now veins and they would give me thorazine whenever i acted up

1600
02:43:43,580 --> 02:43:48,700
so and also probably those records could then be used against you now to deny you access to

1601
02:43:48,700 --> 02:43:53,500
purchasing a firearm also i was a minor and interestingly enough i was still allowed to

1602
02:43:53,500 --> 02:44:01,660
join the military at 17 so you figure that out but um beyond that uh my my kids i have two twin

1603
02:44:01,660 --> 02:44:07,260
boys that were born eight months ago yeah seven months seven weeks premature and of course they

1604
02:44:07,260 --> 02:44:11,980
were the whole time my wife was pregnant you know you need to double up on your flu vaccine you need

1605
02:44:11,980 --> 02:44:15,660
to do all this and that and the other thing and i was like no we're not doing that so were you able

1606
02:44:15,660 --> 02:44:21,340
to keep her protected from vaccines during pregnancy well i've exposed her to a lot of

1607
02:44:21,340 --> 02:44:26,700
your research and and you know alex's research and all that stuff and i've shown her the numbers and

1608
02:44:26,700 --> 02:44:31,500
one of the greatest things after the kids were born i was able to you know read up on a lot of

1609
02:44:31,500 --> 02:44:35,500
different things and i showed the doctors because you know you can never get a doctor when you need

1610
02:44:35,500 --> 02:44:39,500
one but you know you tell them you don't want the kids to have the vaccines you'll see everybody in

1611
02:44:39,500 --> 02:44:46,700
the whole hospital and uh they started showing us all the documentation and i was like well you

1612
02:44:46,700 --> 02:44:52,540
know i'm reading here that there's a fund that the government has for families who have adverse side

1613
02:44:52,540 --> 02:44:58,540
effects from vaccinations how many incidents do you think have to happen before the federal

1614
02:44:58,540 --> 02:45:01,820
government puts a fund together like that all right good question jesse thank you for your

1615
02:45:01,820 --> 02:45:08,220
call dr wakefield let's talk about the pressure that physicians and even physicians assistants

1616
02:45:08,220 --> 02:45:16,220
and so on put on new moms to to be injected even before childbirth during childbirth and after

1617
02:45:16,220 --> 02:45:21,980
childbirth even the medicalization of childbirth in our country today what's around the world all

1618
02:45:21,980 --> 02:45:27,500
of western medicine well mike any pressure any pressure at all in the absence of informed consent

1619
02:45:28,220 --> 02:45:34,620
and adequate safety studies is too much there is huge pressure and there are no safety studies

1620
02:45:34,620 --> 02:45:37,740
particularly of giving the vaccines to mothers during pregnancy where it's been

1621
02:45:38,540 --> 02:45:44,540
specifically contraindicated in the past yeah causes stillbirth or causes spontaneous abortions

1622
02:45:44,540 --> 02:45:50,540
yeah and there is no informed consent a friend of mine went to uh for a vaccine in fact uh to go

1623
02:45:50,540 --> 02:45:55,420
into nursing school the other day and she was given two mmrs just a month apart there's never

1624
02:45:55,420 --> 02:46:00,060
ever ever ever been a safety study of that procedure when asked why should i have a second

1625
02:46:00,060 --> 02:46:07,180
mmr after the first one just a month ago and she said well the mumps vaccine doesn't work therefore

1626
02:46:07,180 --> 02:46:11,660
you need another one booster and well then why do i have to have measles and rubella at the same time

1627
02:46:11,660 --> 02:46:15,260
you can see this cash cow for the pharmaceutical industry right just because that's all they've

1628
02:46:15,260 --> 02:46:18,860
got because that's all they're prepared to manufacture well and also what about vet

1629
02:46:18,860 --> 02:46:24,380
veterinary medicine because if if the theory behind vaccines is that you inject your dog

1630
02:46:24,380 --> 02:46:30,300
with a vaccine and the dog's body builds antibodies to that vaccine why do you get a card or an email

1631
02:46:30,300 --> 02:46:36,140
from your vet every year oh your dog needs the same vaccine again every year i thought the

1632
02:46:36,140 --> 02:46:41,660
i thought the theory was that the antibodies are there they don't go go away at least not i mean

1633
02:46:41,660 --> 02:46:47,260
they're not supposed to it's supposed to build a database your immune system database right yeah

1634
02:46:47,260 --> 02:46:51,500
you could argue that your immune system database needs boosting every every so often but there's

1635
02:46:51,500 --> 02:46:56,540
no science on this so when they introduced mmr in the uk the minister who was responsible said

1636
02:46:56,540 --> 02:47:02,060
this is one dose for life okay so people believe them and so people did it what happened is they

1637
02:47:02,060 --> 02:47:07,100
found it didn't work neither the measles no the river the mumps vaccine uh lasted for very long

1638
02:47:07,100 --> 02:47:11,740
so now it's two doses three doses soon we're going to be on this treadmill of having to have these

1639
02:47:11,740 --> 02:47:16,140
vaccines every year because they do not work in other words here's the irony particularly for

1640
02:47:16,140 --> 02:47:21,260
mumps vaccine the vaccine is successful for the pharmaceutical industry precisely because it

1641
02:47:21,260 --> 02:47:25,980
doesn't work and then exactly volume of sales goes up dramatically that's exactly it because

1642
02:47:25,980 --> 02:47:30,620
by when people go get the mumps vaccine they have a false sense of security thinking they're

1643
02:47:30,620 --> 02:47:34,940
protected from the mumps and they might thereby not take other precautions such as boosting

1644
02:47:34,940 --> 02:47:40,300
vitamin d intake which is very powerful for preventing mumps and many other infectious

1645
02:47:40,300 --> 02:47:46,140
diseases so you're right the vaccines not working is what makes themselves so well and it allows the

1646
02:47:46,140 --> 02:47:51,900
cdc to put out another fear-mongering announcement oh there's another epidemic of mumps better go get

1647
02:47:51,900 --> 02:47:55,820
vaccinated even though it doesn't work that's right we're seeing mumps outbreaks in highly

1648
02:47:55,820 --> 02:48:00,220
vaccinated populations now precisely because it doesn't work and it was a vaccine that was

1649
02:48:00,220 --> 02:48:04,940
never needed in the first place not my word the cdc's word and the department of health in england

1650
02:48:04,940 --> 02:48:09,660
why doesn't the media i mean i guess we already know the answer but it's just it's a shame the

1651
02:48:09,660 --> 02:48:15,740
media never ever reports that in every outbreak they cover most of those who suffer from the

1652
02:48:15,740 --> 02:48:20,060
outbreak whether it's mumps or flu or something else have already been vaccinated against that

1653
02:48:20,060 --> 02:48:26,380
very thing they never report that yes the uh reporting in the media of the vaccine issue is

1654
02:48:26,380 --> 02:48:35,020
so one-sided so distorted so pro uh the cdc prove the pharmaceutical industry pro uh more and more

1655
02:48:35,020 --> 02:48:39,100
vaccines we're not going to get the truth from the mainstream media i'm afraid and that's going

1656
02:48:39,100 --> 02:48:44,300
to last for some time yeah we're not going to get it from truth from them on any front let's go to

1657
02:48:44,300 --> 02:48:50,620
another caller nick in pennsylvania nick welcome to the show you're on the air go ahead sir mike

1658
02:48:50,620 --> 02:48:56,540
first of all i want to say i think that you're doing a great job for filling in for alex thanks

1659
02:48:56,540 --> 02:49:00,460
and uh and you're you're doing a heck of a good job i'm just doing my best here man we're all

1660
02:49:00,460 --> 02:49:06,060
we're all fighting for the same liberties that's all that's all there is to it absolutely and dr

1661
02:49:06,060 --> 02:49:12,940
wakefield i just want to say it's really a pleasure sir to be talking to you i myself

1662
02:49:12,940 --> 02:49:19,260
actually i'm one of america's few remaining pioneer research scientists and it's such a

1663
02:49:19,260 --> 02:49:25,020
good coincidence that you happen to be on because there is a couple subjects that i'd like to talk

1664
02:49:25,020 --> 02:49:32,220
to you about of a very important concern yeah go ahead let's hear it okay one of the subjects is

1665
02:49:32,780 --> 02:49:41,020
i definitely agree with the vaccine problem especially being given to children infants babies

1666
02:49:41,020 --> 02:49:45,980
there's definitely a problem with mercury and heavy metals and i think that they're absolutely

1667
02:49:45,980 --> 02:49:56,300
positively is a link to autism because of that mercury that's why as far as tuna fish is concerned

1668
02:49:56,300 --> 02:50:01,580
that has finally been brought to light that you have to be careful with certain fish you eat

1669
02:50:01,580 --> 02:50:09,580
because of the mercury levels that are high in certain types of fish but another problem

1670
02:50:09,580 --> 02:50:16,060
is also the fact that and it figures that there happens to be a phone ringing in the background

1671
02:50:16,060 --> 02:50:19,660
as i my call comes no go ahead we're getting close to break go ahead with your question

1672
02:50:20,540 --> 02:50:27,660
i apologize but but the other thing that i wanted to bring up you know what let me unplug this other

1673
02:50:27,660 --> 02:50:32,380
phone well let me just ask dr wakefield to comment on that so the fda at one point did say you

1674
02:50:32,380 --> 02:50:36,940
shouldn't eat too much tuna fish because of mercury but they even backed off of that so it's

1675
02:50:36,940 --> 02:50:42,620
so it's suddenly like mercury is the the favorite element of the scientific medical corrupt

1676
02:50:42,620 --> 02:50:46,540
community what's what's up with that i'm told by the experts that mercury is second only to

1677
02:50:46,540 --> 02:50:53,820
plutonium on this planet as a as a toxin so um it's not safe in any form uh or in any dose there

1678
02:50:53,820 --> 02:50:59,500
are no safe levels no safe forms the idea that one's better than the other um we'll be right back

1679

1708
02:54:12,460 --> 02:54:18,780
and by the way don't miss the alex jones show sunday 4 to 6 pm central time and also

1709
02:54:19,420 --> 02:54:26,380
monday i know there will be some big breaking news monday on obamacare and some hidden

1710
02:54:26,380 --> 02:54:31,900
payoffs to big pharma that we have located in the obamacare so-called affordable health care act

1711
02:54:31,900 --> 02:54:36,860
which has made health care unaffordable for almost everyone but dr wakefield continues with us in the

1712
02:54:36,860 --> 02:54:42,300
studio here for this last segment so let's get right to the question of psychiatric drugs and

1713
02:54:42,300 --> 02:54:48,620
their links to violent shooters time and time again dr wakefield although i know perhaps

1714
02:54:49,420 --> 02:54:54,860
psychiatry obviously is not your specialty but you are well-trained m-d or you're skeptical

1715
02:54:54,860 --> 02:54:59,100
thinking scientist what are your thoughts on psychiatric drugs and violent shootings

1716
02:54:59,100 --> 02:55:03,020
well you know it's interesting because it comes it brings in the subject of autism again when

1717
02:55:03,020 --> 02:55:07,980
back in 1996 i got i was first introduced to this i don't remember the port arthur massacre in

1718
02:55:07,980 --> 02:55:14,780
tasmania a guy in the early morning shot over 40 people 45 people dead in a cafe and it was said

1719
02:55:14,780 --> 02:55:19,980
at the time that he had asperger syndrome high functioning autism in fact he didn't at all and

1720
02:55:19,980 --> 02:55:24,380
when you go back and read the psychiatric records from the prison psychiatrist who assessed him

1721
02:55:24,380 --> 02:55:29,660
there he had symptoms which specifically precluded asperger's in other words the common denominator

1722
02:55:29,660 --> 02:55:35,020
was not that they had a psychiatric or a an autistic spectrum disorder so i went back and

1723
02:55:35,020 --> 02:55:40,540
i reviewed so many of these cases that have occurred of multiple killings actions of mass

1724
02:55:40,540 --> 02:55:45,020
violence in schools or some shopping malls i'm looking for a common denominator it comes down

1725
02:55:45,020 --> 02:55:49,340
to this mic looking for patterns what is the pattern is it an autistic spectrum disorder

1726
02:55:49,340 --> 02:55:54,780
no is it a personality disorder no what was the common denominator was that they were all taking

1727
02:55:54,780 --> 02:56:00,700
psychotropic medications and in many cases psychotropic medications that were not licensed

1728
02:56:00,700 --> 02:56:05,180
not indicated for the particular problem that they had there is no site or there certainly

1729
02:56:05,180 --> 02:56:09,820
was at that time no psychotropic medication that could be used for treating asperger's and what we

1730
02:56:09,820 --> 02:56:16,140
now find is that in the last few years jansen pharmaceutical subsidiary of j and j abbott

1731
02:56:16,140 --> 02:56:20,700
laboratories and glaxo smith klein have been pushing these drugs off label to vulnerable

1732
02:56:20,700 --> 02:56:24,940
children in many cases and they've been sued by some states for the off-label marketing of their

1733
02:56:24,940 --> 02:56:29,260
drugs as well absolutely and i've seen this at first hand i've seen violence in children with

1734
02:56:29,260 --> 02:56:33,340
autism at first hand not because they're autistic but i believe because they're being pushed these

1735
02:56:33,340 --> 02:56:39,900
drugs off license uh for inducements like going to a gulf day or going to the spa it's absolutely

1736
02:56:39,900 --> 02:56:46,620
farcical and disgraceful that doctors have uh put children at risk giving them these powerful drugs

1737
02:56:46,620 --> 02:56:51,820
that were never indicated for the problems that they have and i believe that a large part of the

1738
02:56:51,820 --> 02:56:56,380
risk factor for these outbreaks of mass violence is the drugs that they're on well well said and

1739
02:56:56,380 --> 02:57:01,020
just to clarify when i say they they've been sued by the states i don't know if those you mentioned

1740
02:57:01,020 --> 02:57:05,100
have been sued but i know by and large big pharmaceutical companies have been sued time and

1741
02:57:05,100 --> 02:57:10,140
time those three have okay that's good to confirm one of the things we know about these drugs is

1742
02:57:10,140 --> 02:57:16,300
they tend to create a sense of cognitive detachment from reality so for example the columbine shooters

1743
02:57:16,300 --> 02:57:21,100
said that they believe they they were playing out a first-person shooter video game so some people

1744
02:57:21,100 --> 02:57:27,820
might start to blame the video games but i think more is the mindset the the the detachment in the

1745
02:57:27,820 --> 02:57:33,580
mind that's caused by the psychiatric drugs so is this detachment something that you've also seen as

1746
02:57:33,580 --> 02:57:38,700
a pattern in other violent outbursts well it's difficult to tell exactly what's going on in the

1747
02:57:38,700 --> 02:57:44,540
mind of people when they're having for example violent ideation are they playing a game do they

1748
02:57:44,540 --> 02:57:49,500
suddenly feel the world is against them with the ssris the second generation antidepressants it's

1749
02:57:49,500 --> 02:57:53,740
often violence and those people who have no history whatsoever of violent behavior they

1750
02:57:53,740 --> 02:57:58,540
suddenly have these violent outbursts and i've seen it in some of our patients and it stops when

1751
02:57:58,540 --> 02:58:03,420
we stop the drug and isn't it interesting that obama's 23 executive orders not one of them

1752
02:58:04,460 --> 02:58:09,580
looked at the link between psychiatric drugs and violent shootings so he may be ignoring

1753
02:58:09,580 --> 02:58:14,060
the actual cause of all this he may be i don't know you don't know but we do know that that's

1754
02:58:14,060 --> 02:58:18,860
a common denominator and to miss it out in trying to find the culprit for these outbreaks means that

1755
02:58:18,860 --> 02:58:22,380
there are going to be more and more of these attacks because they're not getting to the heart

1756
02:58:22,380 --> 02:58:26,620
the core problem that is causing them the first well they want more attacks dr wakefield they

1757
02:58:26,620 --> 02:58:31,660
want more attacks because it'll let them ban more firearms knives hammers you name it thank

1758
02:58:31,660 --> 02:58:35,340
you for being on the show dr wakefield retransmission begins now and thank you

1759
02:58:35,340 --> 02:58:49,500
