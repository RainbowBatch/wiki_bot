1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,560
Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does

2
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:21,920
he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.

3
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:34,200
Ladies and gentlemen, this again will be one of the most jam-packed transmissions we've

4
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,840
ever engaged in and one of the most important. They are openly announcing at the federal

5
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,160
and state level, and we're gonna go through some of the audio clips, they wanna physically

6
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,440
ban guns and make you turn them in.

7
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,400
We told you that was coming months ago. That's always been their goal. But they're like,

8
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,960
hey, you got a second amendment, you got a right to turn them into us. And hey, Obama

9
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:57,560
can use existing statutory interpretations with his executive order. So you're wrong

10
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:02,520
to freak out. That's what they're saying on CNN and MSNBC, that he's going to use executive

11
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,000
orders to curtail your second amendment.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,440
And they're saying, we're just gonna tell the gun manufacturers they can't manufacture

13
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:13,760
these. That's our power under executive orders. And we're just gonna tell gun shops what they

14
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,440
can and can't do outside of law. We'll call it rulemaking. That's what they've already

15
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,080
been trying the last two years.

16
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:25,080
Now they're politically just gonna try to ram it through. I also have another article

17
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,480
here out of CBS News where they're announcing that they're getting together $20 million

18
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:34,960
to begin with from rich megabanks and globalist. Guys, I am that to you, but it may not have

19
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,640
come through cuz I didn't see it.

20
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:43,440
It was a CBS News article that had Bill Clinton video in it about a national plan to raise

21
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:49,360
money to pass laws at state level. The point is they're bringing a bunch of money to come

22
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,420
after our guns. They're at the White House right now twisting the arm of the NRA president

23
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,960
to go along with all this.

24
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:05,780
This is serious, very, very, very, very serious. Now, Doug Hagman is coming up in 30 minutes

25
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:13,960
and I have not talked to him since I got back from New York. He has talked to his DHS source

26
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:21,560
who told him that indeed we were under surveillance and was feds, not Bloomberg detectives.

27
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:26,080
Well, they look like, cuz I've seen Bloomberg's quote detectives like the mafia around him

28
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,080
multiple times in New York covering things. They look like New York detectives to me.

29
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,880
A lot of times they're under the feds. They all looked exactly like they were brothers

30
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:40,920
or something. I mean, it was just absolute archetype, Goodfellas types, but you could

31
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,000
tell they were cops, like something out of a movie.

32
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,900
And they were in the hotel, they were following us, all this. But I was reading what Doug

33
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:54,320
Hagman put out on his website. He's gonna be joining us 30 minutes about it. And I didn't

34
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:58,260
tell anybody what motel or hotel we were staying in. It was a little boutique hotel scene and

35
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:02,120
put us in. I didn't tell anybody there was a Starbucks catty corner to it.

36
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,880
I didn't tell Hagman this. I didn't tell listeners this. Nobody told anybody this. I hadn't gone

37
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:11,240
through all the details. In his article, his federal source described it all and that they

38
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:15,280
were planning to cause a confrontation. That's what my gut told me. I was like, they wanna

39
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,040
cause a confrontation, stay away from them.

40
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:22,680
So I would literally just turn and walk the other direction, hail a cab, get out. I'd

41
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,400
be walking back, more of them. I mean, they were definitely, and you'd see them, they'd

42
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,720
be looking at a cell phone, looking around. And I mean, they weren't even good at it.

43
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,480
They'd be talking to their sleeve and I'm not looking at you and then start following

44
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,480
you.

45
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,640
People were like, well, go confront them. And we did get one of them on video when we

46
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,320
were coming out of CNN. Well, two more were coming and I just sent a cab and got out of

47
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:47,400
there because they planned to cause a confrontation. Gotta know when to hold them, know when to

48
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:53,040
fold them, know when to walk away, know when to run.

49
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,840
You never count your money when you're sitting at the table. They'll be counting enough for

50
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,340
counting when the dealing's done. And the money I'm looking for, the treasure I'm looking

51
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:04,240
for is liberty. That was another reason I was real angry when I got in there. I was

52
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,320
under the weather, hadn't had a lot of sleep and a bad mood.

53
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:13,360
And I think overall we did a good job getting in their face. I got sent a little text message,

54
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,520
I ought to get him on the show about it. Billy Corrigan, listener of the show, friend, he

55
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:20,920
said Alex, you broke people's hypnosis, could have done a better job. John Rapport said

56
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,320
the same thing.

57
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,340
And people said, man, that was really calculated and good how you made that big scene. It was

58
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:30,120
just I was sick of it. And I was sick of them going, yeah, have him sit out front. Yeah,

59
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,120
look what he's wearing.

60
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,640
I'm like, you're gonna make me look really fat. I mean, it was just they were a bunch

61
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:39,000
of wolves. I wanted them to know I wasn't gonna sit there and play nice with them. And

62
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,940
so that's what happened. But it's just a huge broadcast today, totally jam packed on so

63
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:48,320
many fronts. We're gonna launch officially the transmission on the other side of this

64
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,320
quick break.

65
00:04:49,320 --> 00:05:01,600
That's Thursday, the 10th day of January 2013.

66
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,440
Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive from natural disasters

67
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:11,020
like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on

68
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:15,960
by a disastrous economy? Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything. At e foods

69

direct we hear from customers every day that are fortunate enough to weather life storm

70
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:25,640
by having a supply of food on hand after Hurricane Sandy. Danny from New York City wrote almost

71
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:30,860
all the grocery stores are closed, but I managed to get my e foods just in time to be able

72
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:35,560

73
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:40,320

86
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:08,800
lovers. The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse. The

87
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:14,840
globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce

88
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,960
to the global takeover. That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness

items at infowarshop.com. These are items that I did research on that I personally use.

90

96
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:07,560
We're getting prepared. Are you infowarshop.com? I was trained in firearms. I carried a concealed

97
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:13,600
weapon. I made the determination that if somebody was going to try to take me out, I was going

98
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:23,000
to take them with me. If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States

99
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:29,800
for an outright ban, picking up every one of them, Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all

100
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:38,880
in, I would have done it. Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic. It's Alex

101
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:48,280
Jones. I'm only a man just like you. And I am a soldier of the Republic. And I'm doing

102
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:56,080
the best I can in French warfare at point blank range against these globalists. For

103
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:05,560
17 years. And all I ask is that you stand beside me. All I ask is that you recognize

104
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:10,400
that we're living in total tyranny. You read the headlines today, it sounds like 1984.

105
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:16,120
I was walking by the bank of televisions we have in there in the newsroom. And I looked

106
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:21,000
at the lower thirds, and it was police to take blood nationwide without warrants at

107
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,800
checkpoints. And then I'd walk back by and it would be predator drones to be operated

108
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:31,880
by the UN worldwide. And then I walked back by and it was drones to be armed in the US.

109
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:40,700
And then I walked back by and it said, Alex Jones, revolution coming. It's just totally

110
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:47,880
bizarre. How crazy things have gotten. And I got in here about an hour before showtime

111
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:56,000
this morning and they handed me a email from Doug Hagman of the Northeast Intelligence

112
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:02,520
Network who runs a nationwide famous private investigation outfit that doesn't work for

113
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,840
the feds and state and local government.

114
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:13,320
And he described how I was surveilled in New York. And what happened where, things I haven't

115
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:17,880
even talked about. Because even though I've mentioned being tailed and harassed, it's

116
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:23,140
quite frankly kind of embarrassing that I ran. But I did it cuz my gut said, get out

117
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:29,020
of here, they wanna set you up. They can drop something on you, they can stab you, whatever.

118
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:33,960
And it was clear that they were tracking us by our cell phones. Because whenever I come

119
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,360
around a corner, they'd be looking at the phone and then look up and then walk into

120
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,080
a wall and then start tailing us.

121
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:41,460
They were following us. Just like when your wife knows your number, she can track you

122
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:45,680
exactly down to the foot of where you're at. You're driving down a road trying to find

123
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,560
something and your pin is blue, it's moving. Where you're going is the red pin down to

124
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:55,760
feet. Those systems were designed and put into phones by the Telecommunications Act

125
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:01,800
of 96. And not only could I tell they were what I've seen New York detectives look like

126
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,200
in videos where they're tailing Luke Rudowski and harassing him.

127
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,060
And when I've been covering events and seen Bloomberg surrounded by them, I knew because

128
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:15,800
I'd walk around a corner no matter where I went. And there'd be guys getting out of a

129
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,840
car and then going like this and they're looking at their phones. Or I'd walk around a corner,

130
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,320
there'd be guys looking at their phones and looking up.

131
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,780
And then if you looked at them, they'd say, hey, hi, Alex, big fan. And then it'll give

132
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:30,560
you a dirty look. And then you're walking in, they've got the guys there, you're walking

133
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,440
out, you tell security, I don't wanna go out this door. Bloomberg's people are out there.

134
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:39,760
And the guy's like, you're going out this door. I go, but that's a mall entrance. It's

135
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:44,280
right there, I can see out the door. And he goes, I'm not opening that for you. And you

136
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,960
could see the glass out into the mall.

137
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:51,160
And I said, I wanna go over there. And he said, I'm not gonna open that door. I said,

138
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:55,280
fine, get your camera rolling. So we started to go out the other door and got one shot

139
00:11:55,280 --> 00:12:00,520
of a guy you see talking into his windbreaker. And then he turns as we walk out, and he sees

140
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,480
the camera and puts his face in the wall.

141
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,640
People say, well, why not confront him? I look down the street and two more of them

142
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:10,300
are coming up going, that's him. And I'm like, whoa, cops aren't this confident unless they're

143
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:13,840
about to set something up. And I just said, please, God, let there be a taxi, cuz taxis

144
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,840
never stop.

145
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:18,160
And I went like this and a taxi stopped. We got in and got out of there. And do the review

146
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,760
and the tape, I said, try to get some footage. I mean, and again, we get to the hotel, now

147
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,720
the street's blocked off, little bitty boutique hotel they put us in. There's a Starbucks

148
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:33,160
right there. And we went, got our bags, went and got a cab, and said, go to New Jersey

149
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,920
because that's where our flight was out of anyways.

150
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,200
That's where the main direct flights out of Austin go to Newark. Went to a hotel, got

151
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:44,440
out of there. And that happened, and then Doug Hagman, I haven't even told one-tenth

152
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:48,980
story, sends me an email saying, this is what my federal source said. This is what they

153
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:54,200
did to you. Good thing you didn't go to the Starbucks across the street because that's

154
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:58,040
where they were gonna set you up with a woman who's gonna come up and get in your face.

155
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:01,800
And then they only use selective video of me saying get back or whatever to make me

156
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,560
look like I'm attacking a woman. And they've tried that before, folks. I mean, this is

157
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:13,160
right out of movies, which is based on the real story in JFK, where the district attorney

158
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:17,160
Garrison goes in the bathroom at the airport.

159
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:22,520
And the guy starts running in the stall trying to have sex with him, and then he runs out.

160
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:27,000
And then the police are like, hey, stop, but by then he's already gone. And see, if you

161
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,520
haven't lived this, ladies and gentlemen, you don't know. And you've seen the footage

162
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:35,080
of us tailed, and then they go ahead and pull us over in Canada, and it's cops, or they

163
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:41,840
arrest us, or Bilderberg Group Security is talking to their lapels and following us,

164
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:48,320
getting in the car, speeding after us, Secret Service questioning us, Bohemian Grove.

165
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,600
I told you that I went with History Channel and that they got arrested, and I jumped in

166
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,400
the river and swam off. And later, six months later, they air the piece. And sure enough,

167
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,920
there's the video of it. People are like, well, where's your footage? I'm sorry, I jumped

168
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,920
in the river.

169
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:08,560
I mean, I wasn't going to jail with the police. I mean, this is the real life I live, okay?

170
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,920
It's real. And I know for those of you that have not been on the front lines as a real

171
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:19,560
journalist, I'm not trying to make it Gonzo journalism, where I'm the story. Believe me,

172
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:28,800
I want nothing more than to not be here and to not have to do this.

173
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,520
I want nothing more than to just live in a free country. You know how creepy it is to

174
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:38,560
have multiple people, including an ambassador's daughter on Piers Morgan two nights ago, talking

175
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:45,440
about how great it would be to see me shot and killed and how I need to be popped. And

176
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:51,840
those security people, their little CIA style FBI suits at CNN, I'm telling them, I want

177
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:55,040
to go out the mall entrance, because I've seen that, and I go, I want to go out in the

178
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,040
open mall.

179
00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:00,640
And they go, no, you're not, you're not, you're not. And I go, no, I want to go, okay, okay,

180
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,400
we'll go by there. And I go, okay, there it is. They go, I'm not opening that door, because

181
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:09,600
I have to open it for you. And I went, come on, and the guy just laughed. He goes, no,

182
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,320
you're going out there. And he was really excited, you're going out there.

183
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,560
And he walks out, and you see, again, some guys turn this way, and this other guy walks

184
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:23,440
in the wall, and I walk out and more are coming. And then he was trying to stop me. We're starting

185
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,040
to go to the cabin, he goes, wait, wait. And I go, what? And he goes, give me your badges,

186
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,120
or little paper badges that have to be, and I just threw it at him.

187
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:35,680
But the point is, and then he's looking as I drive off like, I mean, it's just trash.

188
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,820
They all want to play Mafia. Well, you know what, I got there, I covered it, I got the

189
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,920
information out. We're going to analyze and go through the little bit of footage we do

190
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:50,680
have. Do put some of it out. The first night he was back, actually. But this is the type

191
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:54,160
of stuff we deal with.

192
00:15:54,160 --> 00:16:00,880
And I have been so busy fighting the globalist. Since I got back, you'll have to bear with

193
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,720
me that everybody's got these incredible chest colds right now. And I've had this one for

194
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,100
weeks. I thought it was just allergy related, but actually had a fever last night. So I'm

195
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,100
not complaining.

196
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,780
I just want you to know I am under the weather here. If you hear the wheezing and stuff on

197
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:18,760
air or occasional coughing, it's just too important at times to not be here. John is

198
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:25,620
with the chest colds where you've got to focus just not to go into a coughing fit on air.

199
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:34,480
But Hagman's joining us coming up. I thought I would play first a clip just to remind you

200
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,040
that after this happens, they come on the next night and talk about how they want to

201
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,040
pop me.

202
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,600
How great it would be to see Piers Morgan in a uniform killing me. Because that's their

203
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:47,680
fantasy, the state, the power, the uniform. We're gonna execute you like somebody in a

204
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:54,760
ditch in Nazi Germany. Let's queue up. Buzz Bissinger says, popping, and they agree, clip

205
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,760
number three.

206
00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:00,800
And then we're gonna go to a compilation of Rob Dew that he aired last night of Doug Hagman

207
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:06,700
from the 27th saying they're getting ready to go after even physically pro gun groups.

208
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:10,760
And then tied into Conan O'Brien attacking me, putting a gun in my hand with a computer

209
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:16,120
animation and all the rest of it. But here is Buzz Bissinger, here it is.

210
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:21,080
But what do you need a semi-automatic weapon for? The only reason I think you need it is

211
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:26,440
Pierce, challenge Alex Jones to a boxing match, show up with a semi-automatic that you got

212
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,940
legally and pop him.

213
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:31,840
I'd love to see that, in uniform.

214
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,840
I'll borrow my brother's uniform.

215
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,840
I don't think guns are worth more than the answer.

216
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,480
There you go, I'll borrow my brother's uniform. And then there's the part about, we hope his

217
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:42,320
kids don't get killed one night. We hope his kids don't kill him really, I hope they don't

218
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:47,960
get killed. And on and on and on and on and on.

219
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:48,960
And-

220
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,900
I don't want Alex Jones to get the phone call at 3 o'clock in the morning that one of his

221
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:59,200
children have been shot and killed by somebody who shouldn't have a handgun or a rifle or

222
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,240
a automatic weapon. I don't want him to get that.

223
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,000
Yeah, thank you for talking about my kids in the same episode. I mean, a five year old

224
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:12,440
would understand exactly what all this is about. And then I get this, I mean, Doug Hagman

225
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:16,840
definitely has the sources, he says, cuz the sources I have send me a Homeland Security

226
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:20,900
document or a tip.

227
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:27,720
But I mean, Doug Hagman on the East Coast, I mean, he describes what happened here. I

228
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:31,280
mean, sure, there are a lot of Starbucks in New York and things, but I mean, he described

229
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:36,520
that there was a Starbucks right by the hotel and that's where they were planning to confront

230
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,520
me.

231
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,640
I mean, imagine we show up and the streets are blocked around our little hotel, a little

232
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:48,120
boutique hotel. And there's more guys out front and I walk in, there's more guys inside.

233
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,740
These weren't guys in dark suits that were the bellman or the hotel security. They had

234
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:56,760
eyes for you know who. And it just went on and on. I was like, wow, what are they planning?

235
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,760
What were they planning?

236
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:03,880
Well, he says he knows that all his DHS sources, they were gonna get into a confrontation with

237
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:10,360
me. And my gut was don't let them get in a conversation with you. They're gonna set you

238
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:16,120
up somehow. Whether it was drugs or say that crackhead shot me, I don't know. But man,

239
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:25,080
they were so angry and these guys were looking at me like they wanted to kill me.

240
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:28,760
And again, this is what they want to do to all of us. They hate the fact we've got guns

241
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,840
and they can't just go around arresting us all. You notice they're all saying gun owners

242
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:36,060
are the new terrorists, conservatives, libertarians, new terrorists. That's all the homeland security.

243
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:40,480
And if gun owners cower to this, if we get into this, it's over. This is a mafia takeover.

244
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:45,920
That's what the new world order is. It's an organized crime syndicate takeover. We've

245
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:49,200
got all the clips where they're announcing, yeah, we're gonna go after your guns.

246
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:54,760
And no, the president can't take your guns with an executive order CNN said this morning.

247
00:19:54,760 --> 00:20:01,320
They can use existing rulings with an executive order to take your guns. Just amazing spin.

248
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:06,160
Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive from natural disasters

249
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:10,740
like hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on

250

253

ends January 31. Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered why banks stockbrokers

275
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,000
investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs? They've been available since 1986 yet

276
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,040
the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement. Gold is

277
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:46,880
outperform paper investments yet no word about IRAs. If you would like to have gold for your

278
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:53,000
retirement call 800-686-2237. Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns

call 800-686-2237. Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237. Is this the year you

280
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:05,280
finally get serious about your family's drinking water? If so, keep listening for a special

281
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:10,040
offer from big Berkey water filters. Did you know that over 60% of municipal water is fluoridated?

282
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:13,320
Berkey water filters distinguish themselves from many other filtration systems with the

283
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:17,400
capability to significantly reduce dangerous chlorine, fluoride, arsenic and disinfection

284
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:21,320
byproducts from municipal water via the black Berkey and PF line of filters. Then there's

285
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:26,680
affordability. At only 1.7 cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated

286
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:30,240
water, even stagnant pond water. Stop and think how much money you could save by simply

287
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,560
reducing buying bottled water and using water filtered by your Berkey water filter. No need

288
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:38,160
to be constantly replacing expensive filters with a Berkey. A single set of filters can

289
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:43,280
last for 5 to 10 years. Choose the best size Berkey for your needs at BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com.

293
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:12,880
We're back live, Alex Jones here. We're going to get into all the attacks, the talk of executive

294
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:17,280
orders, Cuomo, getting all excited, saying we're going to get their guns. Yay! Well,

295
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:20,760
I thought I wasn't supposed to get excited. I thought I wasn't supposed to get in their

296
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:26,160
face. You know, we're told sit down, shut up, be gentlemanly while we are basically

297
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:31,160
gang raped financially and politically by the New World Order.

298
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:37,240
Our forebears went to war over being disarmed. Imagine some of these ninnying mainline conservatives

299
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:40,940
that are like, Alex shouldn't have gotten in his face. Well, our country wouldn't even

300
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:47,760
exist if people hadn't gotten in the red coat's face. We've gotten here by laying down and

301
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,120
becoming comfortable with basically anything.

302
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:55,620
Let me tell you, have you noticed no other national TV has wanted me on? Even though

303
00:24:55,620 --> 00:25:02,160
Piers Morgan's ratings doubled to a million from 500,000, his highest ratings ever the

304
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:09,320
night after I was on. Next night 800 and something thousand, it's already dropping. You think

305
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,220
they'd all want me on?

306
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:14,800
They were crying, they were panicked, they were hyperventilating because they want to

307
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:20,960
keep you in an NPR trance. Smart guy Billy Corrigan sent me a text message, he said,

308
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,820
right after it, he said, you just broke the hypnosis best I ever saw. I didn't even intend

309
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:25,820
to do that.

310
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:31,280
But that's what it did, it breaks the comfort zone, it gets us up, it gets us awake. They

311
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:37,860
use the Lord of the Rings analogy like when Wormer Grimewood has got the King of Gondar,

312
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:42,920
or the King of Rohan is in a trance and he's like, I'm old, I can't fight the evil. And

313
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:47,240
Gandalf breaks the spell and says, arise.

314
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:51,920
And then the weakness leaves his eyes. We need to pray to God to break this spell the

315
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:57,260
globalist to put over us, that's what it is. We need a pep rally for liberty. That's why

316
00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:01,640
they wanted to intimidate me and set me up because they know they're finally going from

317
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:05,360
he doesn't exist to this guy has a giant audience, tens of millions.

318
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:09,080
We've got to stop him, he's dangerous. Glenn Beck saying the same thing, cuz they all come

319
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:17,600
from the same area wanting to act like there's separation between these groups. They're factions

320
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:27,420
of the same sewage line. And here is a compilation of clips from Doug Hagman on where this is

321
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,840
coming up in a minute, from the 27th.

322
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:37,320
And then everything he talked about coming true with Colonel Bryan, 28, putting a gun

323
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:41,000
in my hand on the show like I was shooting him. I mean, this is the type of stuff that

324
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,380
he said, that's funny, but it's the image it sells. Here is Hagman talking about what

325
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:47,040
was coming in the future, here it is.

326
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:53,160
My source told me pretty much exactly what their plans are and what their contingency

327
00:26:53,160 --> 00:27:00,160
plans are. They've got plan A, B, C, and D, whereas one of my sources calls that a no

328
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:05,680
single point failure. So they're gonna come at us on multiple levels. It's just not gonna

329
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,640
be the legislative level.

330
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:12,840
It's going to be through executive orders, through global initiatives, through health

331
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:17,200
initiatives. It's really an insidious situation.

332
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:23,040
If the president is going to act, there are executive orders, executive action that can

333
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:26,760
be taken. We haven't decided what that is yet.

334
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:30,200
And they're not only coming after the guns, Alex, they're coming after the mouthpieces.

335
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:36,280
They're coming after the Alex Joneses of the world and Doug Hagman's and others who speak

336
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,280
the truth.

337
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:42,460
But tonight, I'll go head to head with a man who actually wants to deport me for having

338
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,800
these very views.

339
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:49,800
They are going to marginalize us before they take us down. They're going to make us look

340
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:55,800
foolish, to make us look like fools on the internet before they pull the plug, obviously.

341
00:27:55,800 --> 00:28:01,720
Now the two men debated gun control. I'm not 100% sure, but I think Alex was the one who

342
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,000
took the pro-gun position.

343
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,400
And I'm here to tell you, 1776 will commence again if you try to take off firearms. We

344
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:19,120
will not relinquish them. Do you understand? Stalin took the guns, Mao took the guns.

345
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:25,240
No one's taking away all the guns, according to my source, the very first people to be

346
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,240
rounded up.

347
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:31,720
The very first targets, if you will, on the radar of this regime are the people that are

348
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:38,280
speaking the truth about what's taking place. Alex Jones, Doug Hagman and others like us

349
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:43,640
who are getting to the heart of the matter, we are the targets for not only the censorship,

350
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,240
but for what's coming after that.

351
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:53,040
What's coming after that is the actual, the physical part of it to take us out of the

352
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,720
fight before it really begins.

353
00:28:55,720 --> 00:29:01,000
Challenge Alex Jones to a boxing match, show up with a semi-automatic that you got legally

354
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
and pop them.

355
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,760
I'd love to see that, in uniform.

356
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:09,680
There you go, and if you're a radio listener, we were putting articles up during that Fox

357
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:14,520
News YouTube gun enthusiast shooting death spurs hunt for suspect. He owned a gun making

358
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:19,920
factory, FPS Russian, he was the guy behind it all, tied down in a chair, shot in the

359
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,520
back of the head.

360
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:26,960
Some evidence is coming out, tortured, no guns or money taken. Another top manufacturer

361
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:31,520
of firearms who was going public, exposing government, drugging of the kids being behind

362
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:35,760
it, he is dead now. And it looks like some more deaths are developing. We're going to

363
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:40,520
be breaking all this down, ladies and gentlemen. If this continues, it's not just a pattern,

364
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,520
we know what's going on.

365
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:46,920
We're going to talk to Doug Hagman straight ahead. He has a federal source that knew exactly

366
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:50,480
what they were planning to do to me in New York.

367
00:29:50,480 --> 00:30:01,400
We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

368
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:05,360

it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.

401
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:43,240
Ladies and gentlemen, we are live and we are broadcasting worldwide. And we're gonna go

402
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:49,920
through some clips here. We've got Doug Hagman of the Northeast Intelligence Network on the

403
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:54,960
line with us. And I got an email from him today and it's up on his website right now.

404
00:33:54,960 --> 00:34:00,000
Kurt Nemo is gonna be posting it at infowars.com and getting it out to folks. And we're also

405
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:06,760
gonna give you his website so you can go look it up for yourself, but it's homelandsecurityus.com.

406
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:13,160
And that night when I went on Piers Morgan, the first two or three times somebody pops

407
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:16,920
out of a doorway and says, hey, I'm a big fan. You're just walking down a random street

408
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:22,040
and they look just like a undercover cop. And one time you see the gun on their side.

409
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:25,920
You're like, okay, but then when you start seeing guys in your hotel looking at you like

410
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:31,080
they wanna kill you and they're obviously off duty police or detective types. And then

411
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,920
when you notice you're being followed or you notice they're out front CNN and when you

412
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:37,720
come out, they're out there. We even have some footage of one of these guys.

413
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:42,380
It gets really crazy. And my gut was, and my dad never calls me, not when I snuck in

414
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:46,040
Bohemian Grove. He knew I was about to do it, not when I'm at Bilderberg. My dad called

415
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:50,320
me and said, you know what, I think you oughta watch your back and get out of New York as

416
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,360
quick as you can. I said, well, it's funny, we're flying out of New Jersey in the morning.

417
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:57,360
I'm gonna go ahead and just go to another hotel there. I'm leaving now. So that went

418
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,360
on.

419
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:03,160
Then the next night, and I've played this clip at Nauseam. We'll play it again coming

420
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:16,320
up here in a few minutes. I am simply watching the next episode of Piers Morgan. And one

421
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,160
guy says, man, gee, I hope his kids don't get killed some night. And I'm thinking, that's

422
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,160
not a veiled threat.

423
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,880
Well, that was creepy the way they said that. And then they go to the next guest, they go,

424
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:27,680
yeah, you oughta get a gun and pop him, shoot him. And then the other guest goes, yeah,

425
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,680
and you can wear a uniform. And Piers like, I'll get my brother's uniform. I guess he's

426
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:33,980
in the military or something. And it's just all bizarre.

427
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:37,520
And then these tweets, people say they wanna kill me and all this stuff. The point is,

428
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:42,360
is this really went on. I've been all over the place. I've gone in Bullhorned Buckingham

429
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:46,920
Palace in the Parliament. I've gone and been there when there's mass arrest at the DNC

430
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:53,280
in New York. I've gone and been covering the DNC in Denver.

431
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:57,660
And guys run up and start screaming, kill Michelle Malkin with video shooting from in

432
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:01,120
front with a guy right behind me. I'm like, why is he behind me screaming, kill Michelle

433
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:04,860
Malkin? Well, it was so they could put it out instantly on the wires. The news just

434
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:05,860
went with it.

435
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:10,640
It was a setup saying I said, kill her. So I've learned about dirty tricks. And thank

436
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:14,240
God we had our own footage later, put it out showing I wasn't saying that it was guys behind

437
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,820
me by the grace of God. They tried to destroy me with that. It was like the headlines were.

438
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:23,440
The end of Alex Jones, he says, kill woman. Now we were in a boutique hotel CNN put us

439
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:28,160
in. And I'm checking into this thing at like four o'clock in the afternoon Monday, and

440
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,320
I'm looking around me.

441
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:40,260
I'm looking around me. And I see, I mean, have you been to enough events to cover stuff,

442
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:43,520
you know what detectives look like. And you know what they look like in New York City.

443
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:46,180
And you know what they look like when they're undercover. They stick out like sore thumbs

444
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:50,200
with windbreakers or sports jackets and they're looking at you.

445
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:53,280
You can tell they're accustomed to authority and doing whatever they want, especially in

446
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:58,220
New York. And if you say something to them, they're like, hey, how you doing? I mean,

447
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:02,200
it's ridiculous. Or you walk out the door and they see you and start talking in their

448
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,440
sleeve and then turn and then walk into a wall.

449
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:08,640
I mean, yeah, absolutely. In fact, if you're a TV watcher, he's gonna roll some of the

450
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:12,680
video on one of the guys. As we leave CNN Center, I'm like, hey, start rolling. I see

451
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:18,880
one of them. Dude turns the camera on instantly. And the guy talking into his sleeve, he then

452
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:22,320
goes back. I don't know if dude got it, but he starts walking into the wall.

453
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:28,200
As soon as he sees the camera, he turns and walks into the wall to get away from the camera.

454
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:31,680
And then there are two more guys coming up. So I hail a taxi. You can even see it. See

455
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:35,840
the taxi? That taxi's pulling up with the grace of God. I hail it and get in as more

456
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,600
guys dressed just like him.

457
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:42,520
I imagine you're walking around town and these guys come out of doorways and go, hey, Alex,

458
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:46,840
how you doing? Obviously, always looking down at their cell phones. You say, well, some

459
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:51,760
of them could have been listers. Yeah, maybe one out of the seven or whatever. And then

460
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,880
it's not on tape, but he turns, his dude starts going over to him for a second and walking

461
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:56,880
into the wall.

462
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:02,680
And I said, dude, I remember doing that. I said, dude, come on. I'm like taxi. And see,

463
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:06,080
I'm looking back right there at two more guys coming up the street dressed just like him

464
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:11,340
so they can all recognize each other. Okay, and then I look down the street and I see

465
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:17,720
the taxi. I hail it, it stops, I get out of there. Unbelievable, and you see me right

466
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:18,720
there looking back.

467
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:23,000
And dude was gonna confront him and my instinct was, get out of here. Normally, I'll confront

468
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:28,760
him. I'm like, wait a minute, they're turf right outside. Why are they doing this? Boom,

469
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:35,400
it happens. Okay, that said, Doug, I'm gonna give you the floor to roll. I want you to

470
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:39,800
go through the entire write up that your source gave you, what this signifies, and I'm gonna

471
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:43,920
play some of the clips here, okay?

472
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:50,720
I wanna play some of the clips here, but I'm gonna give you the floor till we go to break

473
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:55,120
in about ten minutes. Because if I ever start interrupting, I'll just interrupt. I want

474
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:58,840
you to go through your story because here's what happened. Sure, there are 100 Starbucks

475
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,840
in New York or more.

476
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:03,800
I was in a little boutique about ten blocks away from there, no Starbucks around, right

477
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:08,040
on the corner. We come back, the road is blocked around the hotel suddenly. There's more of

478
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:12,280
these guys out there. I see people looking at me out the Starbucks, and I said, this

479
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,280
is a setup.

480
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:18,400
And dude's like, yeah, let's get out of here. I don't know what they were planning. But

481
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:24,720
your guy, from everything he said, now I know you're 100% for real. Because there's stuff

482
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:29,480
in here I didn't tell anybody. But because, quite frankly, it sounds crazy, but I knew

483
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:33,320
I had to get out of there, so I shot the video before I left the hotel, picked my bags up

484
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,520
and left.

485
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:41,280
So Northeast Intelligence Network, law enforcement, certified, 30 years, private investigator,

486
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:45,440
working with the feds, the state, you name it. Doug Hagman, you were here with us a week

487
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,320
and a half ago, on the 27th and 28th. You said they're gonna start targeting us with

488
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,840
dirty tricks, but also physically.

489
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:54,040
Now there's been prominent deaths with the number one gun show in the world that was

490
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:58,580
pro Second Amendment, the guy that runs it, killed execution style, others being killed.

491
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:00,640
What is happening, Doug Hagman, you have the floor.

492
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:06,320
All right, Alex, well, thank you for having me. And I gotta tell you, I was quite surprised.

493
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:13,240
I did catch your appearance on Piers Morgan. I had no idea where you were staying. I had

494
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:16,240
no idea what your itinerary was, who you're with, or whatever.

495
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:19,480
We have not talked until now. Exactly, exactly.

496
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,720
I couldn't get a hold of you yesterday, go ahead.

497
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:30,120
Yeah, I was away yesterday. And when I had contacted my DHS source, the individual who

498
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:34,640
had given me the information, I appeared on your show with last time. And he said, I wanna

499
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:39,880
tell you something that I found out is very disturbing. And if you could relay this to

500
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:43,640
Mr. Jones and the gentleman that he was traveling with.

501
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:49,720
Now, apparently, you were traveling with another individual. I don't know. My information,

502
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:58,160
direct information from you is zero. And in terms of the situation is kind of spotty anyway.

503
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:05,080
So I'm not exactly certain other than what he told me. He said, look, here's the deal.

504
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:12,640
He said, your itinerary, Alex, your itinerary, as soon as the wheels were down in New York,

505
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:17,940
you were under active surveillance by at least two federal agencies.

506
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:24,500
One of the two being the Department of Homeland Security. Three men teams of surveillance.

507
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:29,560
We don't know how many, I was not told how many total agents were involved in this, but

508
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:36,000
you were under active surveillance. But not only just covert surveillance, because that's

509
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,740
normal surveillance. This was a bumper lock type surveillance. And I wrote a textbook

510
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:48,160
on surveillance that's used for law enforcement training as well as college courses for Homeland

511
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,160
Security.

512
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:53,240
So I understand the different types of surveillance we're talking about. But bumper lock surveillance

513
00:41:53,240 --> 00:42:00,320
is where you make your presence known to the subject you're following. And the words from

514
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:06,560
my source were this. The instructions to the teams were bumper lock him, make it obvious.

515
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:13,880
Do whatever you can, just make sure he knows. Handle him as a hostile. Which tells me that

516
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:20,000
they wanted you to know that you were being followed, at least during part of the operation.

517
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:25,120
Now from what I sense and what I had deducted from my conversation with my source, there

518
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:29,440
were a couple of different operations going on here. The first of all was the attempt

519
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:34,180
to psychologically intimidate you. Now from what I understand, and again, I don't know

520
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:39,980
if you recorded it, I don't know what time, if it was live or whatever, but some of this

521
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:44,540
happened before the surveillance happened, obviously before the interview as well as

522
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:46,520
after the interview.

523
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:50,160
But the bumper lock type of surveillance, the physical intimidation, was especially

524
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:55,240
before the interview. And I suspect that would be to destabilize you, to kind of keep you

525
00:42:55,240 --> 00:43:02,900
off guard. And that's what that was. But you had three-man teams actually, three-man teams

526
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:08,520
of operatives following you around. Now the other part of this, the other side of this

527
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:14,840
story, and this is something that didn't shock me, didn't really surprise me, but alerted

528
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:21,160
me, and I alluded to this in our interview the last time we spoke, was you were going

529
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:27,200
to be set up, Alex, and that's the long and short of it, you were going to be set up.

530
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:34,840
It's important that you were to know that there was a woman by a Starbucks. And again,

531
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:40,160
I don't know where you were, I don't know if you passed a Starbucks or if you were in

532
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:45,280
New York City. But apparently, you were to be accosted by or have some sort of physical

533
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:52,760
altercation with a female in front of or near a Starbucks. Now I know that they're prolific

534
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:58,280
in New York City. I guess it wouldn't be a stretch, but nonetheless, if one was close

535
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:03,560
to the studio or your hotel or whatever, I would imagine, or however, if you pass by

536
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:04,740
one.

537
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:10,480
With the intent, Alex, to make you look to embarrass you, in other words, and there was

538
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:17,180
a video surveillance too, let me just reinforce that. In addition to the obvious overt bumper

539
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:23,720
lock surveillance, there was a video surveillance. So the intent of this female was to accost

540
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:31,360
you in a way that you would have to push her off or do something to get her away from you.

541
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:39,560
That would then be on videotape or on disc, on security camera, covert surveillance, footage

542
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:44,160
taken covertly, and then used against you to marginalize you, to show that you were

543
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:50,760
a violent man, to show that you're out of control. And the fact that it would be a woman

544
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:53,960
makes it even more hideous.

545
00:44:53,960 --> 00:45:01,260
And then that's what my source told me. That's with respect to your presence in New York

546
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:06,700
City. That's also my understanding. And I don't know this for a fact that this also

547
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:13,880
was interstate, or yes, interstate, and also may have involved another state, New Jersey,

548
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:17,760
where they crossed the state lines into New Jersey as well. But the fact of the matter

549
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:25,680
is the orders for surveillance came from the higher levels of DHS. This was a DHS sanctioned

550
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:26,680
operation.

551
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:31,600
This is not an NYPD thing. Now, it's possible that the NYPD-

552
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:36,720
Okay, I mean, they just look like NYPD detectives I'd seen. They didn't look like feds. I mean,

553
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,240
they look like scary guys.

554
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:44,960
Oh, I'm sure they did. And it's also possible too. I did not get a lot of details. The contact

555
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:50,340
I had with my source was pretty short, pretty narrow in terms of information, pretty abrupt.

556
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:56,120
But that's the bottom line, that this was a DHS headed operation involving at least

557
00:45:56,120 --> 00:46:01,360
one other federal agency. And by the way, there was coordination. And I don't know,

558
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:08,000
I'm not familiar with CNN or their security staff, but there was coordination there with

559
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,320
building security as well.

560
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:15,280
Oh, no, the guy was laughing at me. I said, listen, I want to go out. I saw a mall entrance

561
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:18,600
because it's built onto a giant mall. I said, I want to go out there. And they said, no,

562
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:22,760
you're going out there and really enjoyed shoving me out on the street with one guy

563
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:26,760
that turned and walked into the wall looking right at us. Two more guys, by the grace of

564
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:31,320
God, I got that cab. My instinct said, get in the cab, get out of here.

565
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:36,800
You did well. I mean, follow that little voice, but you did well because had you fallen into

566
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:42,720
any one of these traps that they had set up for you, things could have turned dramatically

567
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:48,880
different for you. And this is one thing too, that the high profile people, the gun owners,

568
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:52,880
the people that speak out, the proponents of the second amendment, the proponents of

569
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:57,920
the constitution, we are in trouble. We are targets for this kind of thing. And people

570
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:02,840
think, oh, this doesn't happen. No, it happens all the time. Well, not all the time. It happens

571
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:10,960
more than you think. And it's sanctioned activity because what better way, what better way can

572
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:19,360
they take us out of the fight by marginalizing us by push a woman or you're caught doing

573
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:23,080
something. They take the video and edit it so it looks

574
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:28,760
a little bit different. And what I have seen are clips from the late night show that you'd

575
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:35,120
shown where you had a gun in your hand. Shooting people in there.

576
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:42,440
Yeah, it's ridiculous. So you know the capabilities obviously of what they're capable of.

577
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:46,280
Why do you think the next night they came on and make cryptic statements about my children

578
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:50,680
being killed at night and then cryptic statements about how they all want to shoot me and kill

579
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:55,120
me and how much fun it would be? I don't have any direct information on that.

580
00:47:55,120 --> 00:48:00,820
So what I would say would be speculation. But once again, there's a destabilization

581
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:10,880
factor to keep you off focus, off target. And we see this happen to others a lot. When

582
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:18,080
you're fixated on a target, the most vulnerable thing, the most vulnerable you can be is when

583
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:22,920
they start talking about your wife, your children, your parents, if they're elderly, they do

584
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:28,960
this and they do it intentionally and maliciously with the intent to get you focused on something

585
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:33,140
else and to even perhaps intimidate you into silence.

586
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:40,440
This is not by accident. Those comments, for as many people, and it's funny because you

587
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:45,680
could have someone in a studio, and I've seen this happen before in other situations, you

588
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:51,720
can have somebody in a studio that they're told to say something about, oh, just go ahead

589
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:56,900
and make a joke about, we know he's got kids or make a joke, we know he's got a family.

590
00:48:56,900 --> 00:49:01,800
Go ahead and make a joke with the family, if you can fit it in there. It's done by design

591
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:02,960
and it's done to intimidate.

592
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:08,280
No, that's exactly what they do. And so why does your DHS source reach out to you on this

593
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:10,600
because they were concerned?

594
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:17,680
Absolutely. My source is a God-fearing Christian man. He knows what's going on. He doesn't

595
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:23,260
like it. He understands that there is a need for security for the United States, but there's

596
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:33,000
not a need for this out-of-control, tyrannical, gun-grabbing police state that we are involved

597
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
in.

598
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:39,320
What do you make of SPS Russian, the head guy behind it being killed execution style,

599
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:43,160
tied down in a chair, shot in the back of the head, nothing stolen from his factory?

600
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:49,560
I gotta tell you, Alex, the first time I heard about it was yesterday. In fact, when I heard

601
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:54,440
part of your program, I gotta tell you, I'm very concerned about this. I do think as we

602
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:58,960
talked earlier about the purge, I think that there is a purge taking place.

603
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:04,880
And as some of the more high profile people, they will set examples. They will take people

604
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:05,880
out.

605
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:10,760
And they canceled three gun shows that were top shows on Discovery. Another top manufacturer

606
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:14,600
died very mysteriously. I've got that article out of Military Times. I mean, this is starting

607
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:18,480
to get a little crazy. If we see a couple more of these, we know it's like a Clinton

608
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,960
deathless type deal against gun owners.

609
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:24,560
This is a globalist mafia we're dealing with. And if they can't get it legislatively, or

610
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:27,600
if we won't go along with an executive order, I guess they think they're just gonna start

611
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:30,360
going after us.

612
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:34,280
And they think that they can get away with it. The hubris behind these people is something

613
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:39,940
to be reckoned with and to be recognized. But that's also indicative of their weakness

614
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:44,480
as well. We have to understand that these people are psychopaths. I mean, really, they're

615
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:53,760
real psychopaths. The way they think, and people might think I'm crazy, but the Luciferian

616
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:57,520
satanic agenda, that mindset, folks, that's real.

617
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:01,240
It is. Stay there, investigative reporter and investigator.

618
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:05,300
Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid

619
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:10,000
seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that in a real meltdown,

620
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,960
non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold? It's true, seeds have

621
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:17,480
outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could

622
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:22,040
even happen again. So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect

623
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:28,480
mix of non-hybrid seeds. They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply

624
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:32,780
of nutrient-dense food for you and your family. And here's the best part. These seeds have

625
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:36,920
not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant

626
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:43,680
a full acre crisis garden. So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com.

627
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:55,400
Or give them a call at 877-327-0365. That's 877-327-0365. Remember, in a real crisis,

628
00:51:55,400 --> 00:52:01,040
non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item. This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.

629
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:06,040
We can buy GMOs stressed out about money and blasted by the electric environment. Hi, I'm

630
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:11,560
Pastor Jenny, and that was the state I was in back in 2010. Then I learned about RNA

631
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:17,880
drops. I learned that 97% of my DNA that scientists have called junk is actually packed with millions

632
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:22,640
of gene switches that play a critical role in controlling how my cells, organs, and other

633
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:26,880
tissues behave. I learned I don't have to put up with disease decay or decline like

634
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:32,560
I'd been conditioned to believe. I began taking RNA drops, a 100% natural formula designed

635
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:38,080
to turn on those switches and provide me with amazing health and joy. Learn more about RNA

639
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:07,800
You land in Buenos Aires, then a shuttle to Santa Rosa, where a nicely furnished cabin

640
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:13,920
with all amenities, Wi-Fi, executive food and wine, and laundry service awaits. After

641
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:21,720
a good night's sleep, your adventure begins. You're on a golden stag safari for big game.

642
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:28,440
But it's not Africa. It's Argentina. One-on-one guided hunts for water buffalo, cougar, bighorn

643
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:35,160
rams, wild boar, and the biggest stag deer in South America. All gold medal quality.

644
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:42,880
All the action you can handle. Land rovers, top rental guns with scopes, all food, beverages,

645
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:48,160
hunting guides, ground transportation included, and more. All more affordable than you can

646
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:55,720
imagine. The adventure of a lifetime starts at goldenstagsafaris.com. The big game hunting

647
00:53:55,720 --> 00:54:15,160
ranch, goldenstagsafaris.com. They don't want to see us tonight. All they want us to do

648
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:25,760
is keep on pushing us higher. They don't want to see us live together. All they want us

649
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:30,280
to do is keep on killing one another. All they want us to do is... Here's another song.

650
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:37,120
I saw Sheriff John Brown coming down the street with a gun in his hand. You know that song?

651
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:44,360
I shot the sheriff. What was I to do? He drew on me. See, we're supposed to just bend over

652
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:48,960
to all this. And the American people aren't going to do that. And I'll say this on air.

653
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:53,400
I probably in hindsight, I watched Larry Pratt last night destroy Piers Morgan. And at the

654
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:57,000
end, he said, you're not my friend to him because he knew he'd been beaten. I wish I

655
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,440
could do that more. And sometimes I've gone on shows and been very calm.

656
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:04,280
But when you're got a chest cold, when you're angry, when you've just been messed with on

657
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:08,840
the street, by detective after detective or whatever they were popping out of the dark,

658
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:14,200
and you see all this, just the disgustingness of it, you get angry. And you know what, when

659
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:18,600
we need to get out of our coma, I know a lot of limbing Americans sit there and they see

660
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:21,060
somebody like me getting angry and they go, that's scary.

661
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:26,000
You know what's scary is the drones in our skies and the NSA spying on us. And people

662
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,040
don't even think I snuck into Bohemian Grove because they can't believe anything real was

663
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:32,960
done. They can't believe I made films that have been seen, some of them 40, 50 million

664
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:43,280
times online. I mean, I'm real. You're real. We can beat these globalists. But be honest,

665
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:51,000
Doug Hagman, about, as you said, my performance on air, I think overall, like Billy Corgan

666
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:56,800
said, it shocks people out of their hypnosis.

667
00:55:56,800 --> 00:56:00,940
I think overall it's gonna be positive, cuz folks can say, hey, makes gun owners look

668
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:05,360
like aggressive people. Folks, our founders tarred and feathered people before the revolution.

669
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:08,920
Our founders killed people that tried to take their rights. I'm not calling for that. What

670
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:13,520
would they think of our founders today? I mean, I simply was there saying, look, I'm

671
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:14,880
off the script.

672
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:21,040
I know you want our guns to enslave us. Knock it off. And plus a foreigner here lecturing

673
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:26,440
us and putting out tweets about how Americans are stupid scum and how he's conquering us.

674
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:30,880
I mean, I'm angry at him. I'm angry I gotta risk my life up against these people. I'm

675
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:34,400
angry they act like they care about us all day when they're a bunch of authoritarians.

676
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:37,720
Doug, your take on this.

677
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:44,840
One thing I have to say, Alex, I can guarantee you this. I do a radio show with my son every

678
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:52,320
night and we were talking and one of the things that came up was this. When you said Piers

679
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:57,320
Morgan, the hatchet man for the new world order, I can guarantee you that phrase will

680
00:56:57,320 --> 00:57:01,840
be remembered and remembered throughout television history.

681
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:07,340
I can guarantee you that numerous things that you said will be remembered. But how many

682
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:12,400
people for the next guest, I believe it was Sheriff Joe Arpaio, how many people remember

683
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:18,440
what he said? Not too many, but how many people remembered what you said? All the viewers.

684
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:21,520
So was mission accomplished in that respect? I believe it was.

685
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:27,240
Exactly. They were crying, fuming, melting down. He looked like he'd had his blood drained

686
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:32,560
and none of the national TVs invited me on. I mean, if I'm so discrediting, why not have

687
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:33,560
me on?

688
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:40,200
Sure. And you know, the anger issue, at what point? What's it going to take for Americans

689
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:44,820
to get angry? I mean, we're seeing our mothers, our daughters, our aunts, our grandmothers

690
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:51,400
being fondled at the airports. We're being treated like slaves. We're being physically

691
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:57,240
molested. We have women, our wives. I mean, we're the men in this country. Where is the

692
00:57:57,240 --> 00:58:03,300
anger? It's easy to sit behind a keyboard to develop beer mussels, virtual beer mussels

693
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:07,720
behind a keyboard, Alex. It's simple for somebody to do that. Sit back here and second guess

694
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:12,280
anybody, second guess you, second guess me and say, well, you know, whatever. But the

695
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:18,200
bottom line is this. We need to be angry. We need to show that anger. And the anger

696
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:19,440
is a righteous anger.

697
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:22,480
Well, it's more than that. We're getting to the end of the line here.

698
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:23,480
Yes.

699
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:27,140
Okay. I mean, there's two lights in the tunnel. One's a trend that's going to run us over.

700
00:58:27,140 --> 00:58:30,800
The other's a juncture. And we got to get, I mean, I know my life's on the line. I know

701
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:34,800
this stuff's real. I know those detectives are real. I know the death threats are real

702
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:43,800
and I'm angry. I know Piers Morgan works for the new world order. I don't like it.

703
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:47,600
This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.

Tyranny is here. The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality. It really says

706
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:06,040
that the state is God. The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most

707
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:11,520
oppressive police states on earth. This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret

708
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:17,600
network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide. This documentary exposes how the continuity

709
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:22,580
of government program has established an all powerful shadow state. Police state four chronicles

710
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:27,180
the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen. Prepare to enter the secretive

711

world of emergency dictatorship, body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror

712
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:38,280
and cameras on every street corner. It's only the beginning of the new world order's hellish

from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.

718
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:34,160
All right, we got five more minutes with Doug Hagman joining us. You don't understand, ladies

719
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:39,000
and gentlemen, you know, Rob Dozle. I think we're being followed by those guys. Those

720
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:42,360
guys are cops. And I'm like, yeah, they've been at the hotel since the time we got here.

721
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:46,000
You know, you're in a hotel checking in, you're tired, you don't feel good. You wanna go lay

722
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:50,600
down for an hour. And then there's guys, obviously police, looking at you.

723
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:55,440
You're just like, hopefully they're just in here for some reason. Then you notice they're

724
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:59,360
talking into their sleeves cuz they all get into secret. Just a note, people ever wanna

725
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:04,040
be quote spies? The really good ones are like old ladies and stuff and aren't sitting there

726
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:09,480
talking into their sports jackets. I mean, it's so ridiculous.

727
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:12,560
They all get into these movies. They think they're 007 or something. That's not how the

728
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:18,440
real world works. I'm an agent of the Republic. I'm a vestigial left over of Americana, just

729
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:23,080
there desperately in my own ham-fisted way trying to fight these people. And look, man,

730
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:26,080
I don't do the best job a lot of days, I told you that.

731
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:29,720
You can analyze it, either say it was a great victory or a great defeat. All I know is I'm

732
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:35,480
stumbling into the arena, man, after a lot of hard battles already exhausted. I'm like

733
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:40,760
a quarterback that's been in 12 games in a row and has got both shoulders blown and my

734
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:41,760
knees blown.

735
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:44,760
And I'm there getting run over. And people are like, look at him down on the field stumbling

736
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:50,760
around. Hey, man, there's a war going on. That's all I can tell you. And I think the

737
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:56,240
course is to get upset and get in their face. And that's what scares the system so much.

738
01:01:56,240 --> 01:02:00,560
They'll try to spin getting upset is bad. And it is bad to some people out there that

739
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:06,760
have been limingized. But Doug Hagman, Northeast Intelligence Network, any other points you'd

740
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:10,680
like to add about what happened and what is happening?

741
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:14,440
Do you think talking about this will stop them from trying to set me up?

742
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:19,840
Well, it can't hurt any Alex. I mean, their agenda is what their agenda is. They're out

743
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:26,300
to marginalize anyone who is speaking out proponents of the Second Amendment, the First

744
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:31,100
Amendment, speaking out against tyranny, speaking out against the truth, what they're doing

745
01:02:31,100 --> 01:02:35,220
in the shadows. We need to keep doing it. You need to keep doing it. We need to pray

746
01:02:35,220 --> 01:02:39,980
for you, Alex, because you're at the tip of the spear. And I think we all need to play

747
01:02:39,980 --> 01:02:42,780
our zones or particular positions.

748
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:47,560
But you know, you can only last so long out there at the tip of the spear by yourself.

749
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:52,940
We need reinforcements. We need to back you up. We need to back each other up. We have

750
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:57,400
to realize that we're all in this together. I don't want to be trite, but you know how

751
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:59,800
they say if we don't-

752
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:02,600
Hang together, we hang separate.

753
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:09,920
Exactly. And that's what it is. These people can be intimidated back into submission. They're

754
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:13,600
trying desperately to fulfill their objective.

755
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:19,000
They're trying to bully us. We have got to righteously get them back in line.

756
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:24,880
That's right. And I think too, Alex, just in my personal opinion, we're fighting a spiritual

757
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:29,460
battle as well in addition to the earthly battle. And I think we have to recognize that

758
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:36,940
this is pure evil what's going on out there. And it's just we need to not only fight on

759
01:03:36,940 --> 01:03:42,040
a practical level, but we need to pray on a spiritual level. Certainly our prayers are

760
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:43,040
with you.

761
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:47,040
Well, my gut told me just get away from those, because I'm usually the type that just confronts,

762
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:50,080
but I thought, well, they could set me up with something. I mean, what do you think

763
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:53,280
they might have been trying to do? Just drop something on me or what?

764
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:58,760
I really think the issue with the Starbucks, again, I don't know the geography where you

765
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:00,280
were if there was one around you.

766
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:02,960
There was a Starbucks right on the corner and they blocked the streets off around the

767
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:07,220
hotel and there were guys watching when we even came up.

768
01:04:07,220 --> 01:04:12,640
That bothers me the most, because I think that whatever they had planned involved getting

769
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:18,640
you on videotape, perhaps shoving, like I said, shoving a woman or bear, or it would

770
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:25,560
have appeared that you were bullying a woman. And that bothers me because if they can set

771
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:28,000
you up in that fashion, they can set anyone up.

772
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:33,200
They did that with Michelle Malkin. Yes. Well, yes. They had guys because I wasn't as sophisticated

773
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:38,280
even five years ago at the DNC. Like why are these guys standing behind me screaming? And

774
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:42,880
they were, we caught them on, we got the tape going, kill Michelle Malkin and then they

775
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:46,240
left with her.

776
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:49,760
We need to be aware of our surroundings all the time. You need to be extra special.

777
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:52,800
No, I'm going to have to get, I'm going to have to go to the security route now. That's

778
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:57,540
it. I mean, it's obvious. I got it. Doug, thank you so much. Gerald Cilente coming up.

779
01:04:57,540 --> 01:04:59,200
Thank you, Doug. We'll check in with you more soon.

780
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:00,200
All right, sir.

781
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:01,200
God bless you.

782
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:06,600

787
01:05:31,060 --> 01:05:35,880
gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and leave the silver

788
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:41,400
at the surface. But rather, we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin nourishing

789
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:46,480
chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the

790
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:54,580
silver more effectively. Visit www.silverlungs.com and click on our store page to find what silver

Alex Jones here with a very important announcement for truth seekers. We've carried a lot of

802
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:09,880

01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:16,060
com. And out of all the titles we've carried, one stands out because it is just so chillingly

804
01:07:16,060 --> 01:07:21,640
convincing and that's dreams from my real father by Joel Gilbert available at info wars

805

dot com. This film exposes the fraud that Obama is like nothing I've seen. If you want

to know who Obama's real daddy is, this is the film for you. Don't forget your purchase

809
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:47,240
carrying behind the green mask you in agenda 21 by Rosa Corey. This book is coffin nails

I've ever seen exposing the scourge that is vaccines. These titles and a lot more are

812
01:07:57,480 --> 01:08:07,280
all available at info war shop dot com. Crashing through the lies and disinformation. It's

813
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:35,560
Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.

814
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:42,080
We are live, ladies and gentlemen, now into the second hour. It is the 10th day here of

815
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:50,100
January 2013. And the national media said how horrible that I pointed my finger at the

816
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:55,320
Brit over here in America telling us to get rid of our Second Amendment and told him 1776

817
01:08:55,320 --> 01:08:56,320
would commence.

818
01:08:56,320 --> 01:08:59,680
Well, Ron Paul was on yesterday. We're gonna play it later in the hour for Gerald Salente.

819
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:03,920
He agreed. He said, I've always said it's the line in the sand. It'll cause a civil

820
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:09,520
war. I'm not calling for a civil war every day you've heard me. I want to stop this from

821
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:14,640
happening. They want to persecute us. They want to come after our guns because the guns

822
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:16,280
go, it all goes.

823
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:19,520
They're already saying they wanna raise taxes again now. They're already saying they wanna

824
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:23,680
cut benefits again. We're going into austerity, the same blueprint they've used in Europe

825
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:28,760
that Gerald Salente has warned about for so many years. Here's the McClatchy newspaper

826
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:33,160
headline as new fiscal cliff nears, Democrats seek more tax increases.

827
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:37,160
Before we go to Gerald though, I wanna just say this. Yes, watching Larry Pratt last night,

828
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:43,700
we're gonna play this in the next hour, skillfully, calmfully destroy Piers Morgan was powerful.

829
01:09:43,700 --> 01:09:50,520
And that is how I would have rather have done it. But I get angry sometimes and we will

830
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:55,120
make a lot of lemonade out of the lemons, but I don't even think it was lemons to begin

831
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:56,120
with.

832
01:09:56,120 --> 01:09:58,800
That's how they try to spin it. Notice they're not inviting me on other shows, national TV

833
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:02,320
shows. They were freaked out because they knew that was gonna make big news and get

834
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:07,360
people out of their coma. As a lot of top media people I've talked to on record, off

835
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:13,160
record, they said no, that was history making because it shocked Americans out of their

836
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:14,160
days.

837
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:18,440
At first, it's uncomfortable to somebody under hypnosis though, to be shocked out of it.

838
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:22,320
And that's what we got. A lot of people were negative up front, but now it's getting more

839
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:27,720
and more positive. That said, I'm always the person to second guess myself. It is what

840
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:34,080
it is. But I could have gotten to more points. I probably went too far yelling at him into

841
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:37,240
the second segment, should have done less of that.

842
01:10:37,240 --> 01:10:41,920
But it doesn't matter. They're going to misrepresent no matter what. The point is, we're in a coma.

843
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:45,980
When are we gonna get angry? That's why I love when Gerald Cilente comes on. He gets

844
01:10:45,980 --> 01:10:50,840
angry sometimes. Cuomo's all angry in this new speech we're gonna play. We gotta get

845
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:53,240
these guns, they're hurting the kids, get them.

846
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:58,600
I was like, yeah, or they're like, don't raise your voice. That's so animalistic. They want

847
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:04,640
us to sit down and shut up. I think we've been way too meek. Did I go too far? Maybe.

848
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:10,120
But the point is, they're demonizing gun owners one way or the other. I wanna play this clip

849
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:16,420
of them talking about how I need to be shot. And then the other guest and the host talk

850
01:11:16,420 --> 01:11:19,520
about dressing up in a uniform to do it like it's okay when the state does it.

851
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:20,520
Here's that clip.

852
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:26,240
What do you need a semi-automatic weapon for? The only reason I think you need it is, Pierce,

853
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:31,120
challenge Alex Jones to a boxing match. Show up with a semi-automatic that you got legally

854
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:32,120
and pop him.

855
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:34,920
I'd love to see that. In uniform.

856
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:37,160
I'll borrow my brother's uniform.

857
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:41,400
There you go. And he says he'll borrow his brother's uniform. Pierce agrees. Again, if

858
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:47,920
I or Gerald Cilente or Ron Paul said anything remotely close to let's kill somebody with

859
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:51,760
a rifle, it would be like it was the end of the world.

860
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:55,240
And then with other people, I mean, folks get arrested all the time for joking around

861
01:11:55,240 --> 01:12:00,280
about bars. Hey, I wanna shoot that guy, blah, blah, blah. Yeah, Bob, let's do it. I'll help

862
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:04,560
you, I'll get the bullets. Conspiracy to commit murder, boom. People are like, we were just

863
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:08,240
joking, doesn't matter, grand jury just indicted you.

864
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:12,400
These people are on TV knowing nuts are out there. They know when they hype up these school

865
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:17,340
shootings where they victim disarm, it advertises that's the place to go. And so I got into

866
01:12:17,340 --> 01:12:21,200
all of that probably overcompensating as I was under the weather.

867
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:24,520
Never had, I thought it was an allergy, but it's actually a fever last night so that a

868
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:30,920
chest cold. But the point is, is that it was so disgusting I blew up. Now Gerald wants

869
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:34,560
to get into a bunch of economics today and a bunch of other big issues that are happening.

870
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:40,000
But I wanna get his take on this. And of course, the news website that you've absolutely got

871
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:44,600
to visit over there is trendsresearch.com.

872
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:49,760
Gerald Cilente is an American trends forecaster, publisher of the Trends Journal, business

873
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:54,240
consultant and author. He's made a lot of incredibly accurate predictions, not just

874
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:58,160
about events, but major trends. He's been on every major television news show you can

875
01:12:58,160 --> 01:13:02,080
imagine in the world, trendsresearch.com, subscribe today.

876
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:08,360
Okay, Gerald, break down your take if you want on the overall open assault on the Second

877
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:12,780
Amendment and how it ties into everything else. And your take on what happened with

878
01:13:12,780 --> 01:13:13,780
Piers Morgan.

879
01:13:13,780 --> 01:13:23,080
Well, first of all, I wanna say and I wanna make this 100% clear. I am 100% behind Alex

880
01:13:23,080 --> 01:13:34,680
Jones on his stand against the government, imposing any more legislation, rules or regulations

881
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:41,760
to take our guns away from us. I am totally opposed to what they are doing and I totally

882
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:49,480
support your belief in what you're doing to protect our rights. So I wanna make that really

883
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:51,120
clear.

884
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:58,400
And as I look at this issue and as it evolves and devolves, the politicians are doing nothing

885
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:05,740
more than using this for political capital. These are a bunch of inepts and incompetence

886
01:14:05,740 --> 01:14:11,760
that have failed at everything that they do. Now, all of a sudden, the fiscal cliff is

887
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:18,840
out of the news and the official jerks who have been officially incapable of doing anything

888
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:24,880
to solve the major problems are now grabbing on this gun control issue.

889
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:30,500
And as you pointed out, they're all shooting off their fat mouths coming up with their

890
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:38,720
solutions on how to solve the problem. As I look at the problem, this is what I see.

891
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:49,280
300 million guns out there. What are you gonna control? It'll be as ineffective as prohibition.

892
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:59,720
It will be as ineffective as the war on drugs and it will be costly to everyone and in the

893
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:09,900
not only financially, but raping us more of our rights from us, which they love to do.

894
01:15:09,900 --> 01:15:18,760
They are the DC gang, the greatest rapists of human rights in the history of the United

895
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:25,160
States. They love to rape us. So they're going to be totally ineffective.

896
01:15:25,160 --> 01:15:35,360
Number two, as you well know, and I know that you have the facts down on guns and who uses

897
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:41,920
them and where they come from better than virtually anybody out there. And as you well

898
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:49,720
know, Alex, most of the crimes that are committed using guns are committed by the criminals,

899
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:55,680
the gang bangers, and the other slime out there in society.

900
01:15:55,680 --> 01:16:02,240
And what are, where did those guns come from? No, no, no. They didn't come from mommy or

901
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:08,640
daddy's closet where they weren't locked up. Those are unregistered guns. Those are black

902
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:15,560
market guns. Hey, maybe they're even the guns from Fast and Furious. Who knows? So then

903
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:28,240
the other issue becomes there is a no argument for them to be imposing more rules that are

904
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:37,480
not going to work. So I support your strong stand on we, the people should be able to

905
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:44,280
protect ourselves. And as you pointed out and you show those little weenies, I love

906
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:46,440
that guy Dershowitz on there.

907
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:54,000
You know, if I was around Alex Jones and I would be afraid that he would come after me

908
01:16:54,000 --> 01:17:00,600
with a gun. Hey, take it easy, Alan boy. If Alex Jones came after you with a feather duster,

909
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:07,480
that will knock you over. So these little guys, these little boys out there that are

910
01:17:07,480 --> 01:17:12,560
telling us what we should do to protect ourselves their way on.

911
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:16,120
Absolutely. I want to get your next take on that. We've got breaking news, Gerald. And

912
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:19,920
this continues. There's a lot of evidence this could be provocative. Shooting outside

913
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:25,600
Bakersfield, California, where we have a 50,000 watt affiliate. California school shooting

914
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:29,800
two reportedly shot at Taft Union High School near Bakersfield.

915
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:33,680
At least two people were shot. That's how Sandy Hook started was two at Taft Union High

916
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:38,880
School in Kent County, California. This morning, as the suspected shooter has been taken into

917
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:42,720
custody, according to local media reports, let's pray to God nobody dies. Let's pray

918
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:46,760
to God. It's time to arm these schools now, folks. They're advertising a minute.

919
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:51,400
ABC News in Bakersfield said the incident happened at 9 AM. That's just minutes ago,

920
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:55,240
their time. This is incredible. Gerald Cilente, what's your take on that?

921
01:17:55,240 --> 01:17:59,240
Well, my take again is what are the other issues that you keep talking about? What kind

922
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:06,560
of psychotropic drugs are these people on? What kind of society, a cruel nature of society,

923
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:12,320
a culture of cruelty that we had? Who are these people that are committing the crimes?

924
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:17,240
What drugs are they on that they wouldn't answer you when you brought it up? That each

925
01:18:17,240 --> 01:18:22,800
one of these, there's records of them showing how many people on psychotropic drugs are

926
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:23,800
killing this.

927
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:32,660
How about the new guy Obama just nominated for the CIA, who, as I understand, is so much

928
01:18:32,660 --> 01:18:39,280
in favor of, quote, enhanced interrogation techniques. How about torture?

929
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:44,840
Well, that's like Dershowitz. Dershowitz wrote a paper saying torture should be normalized

930
01:18:44,840 --> 01:18:47,780
and they should just torture us whenever they want.

931
01:18:47,780 --> 01:18:49,480
So that's what I'm saying. It's not about-

932
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:53,320
I mean, he's the one that's creepy. I mean, we've been out to dinner and stuff. We're

933
01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:58,280
just normal, nice, calm guys. These are the weird, creepy monsters that think torture's

934
01:18:58,280 --> 01:18:59,280
good.

935
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:06,080
Exactly, so what I'm saying is, whatever happened just now is another American tragedy, but

936
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:13,560
it has to do with the entire culture of cruelty. No, you watch all those violent video games.

937
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:15,440
No, no, it's not gonna affect-

938
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:18,960
Cruelty to animals, people are into that now, that's like chic.

939
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:24,140
Exactly, so what I'm saying is, no, they're not gonna affect everybody violent, but people

940
01:19:24,140 --> 01:19:31,280
on the edge that become over consumed with them. Again, the drugs, no one is talking

941
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:39,720
about the psychotropic drugs. This is not a gun control issue, it's a mind control issue.

942
01:19:39,720 --> 01:19:45,280
And the minds of Americans, pick up the paper today. Go look at the last study that just

943
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:50,000
came out. It has nothing to do with this, but everything to do with it.

944
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:53,640
Gerald Salente, Gerald Salente, we gotta go to break. We'll come back and talk more about

945
01:19:53,640 --> 01:19:58,360
this in the economy, trendsresearch.com, and you can get their quarterly magazine that

946
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:01,560
is an absolute must read for everybody right there at Trends Research.

947
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:06,520
Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive? From natural disasters

948
01:20:06,520 --> 01:20:11,100
like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought, to the family hardships brought on

949
01:20:11,100 --> 01:20:16,040
by a disastrous economy. Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything. At eFoods

953
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:35,240

Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors. Are we going to see economic

970
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:10,320
growth slide into recession or at worst depression? Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources. We

971
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:14,600
all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety

972
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:19,080
is prudent. When the market becomes volatile, U.S. treasuries are a safe haven. But what

973
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:24,260
do you do when the U.S. government overextends itself and spends beyond its means? Many investors

974
01:22:24,260 --> 01:22:29,040
are turning toward gold as a common sense alternative to traditional paper investments.

975
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:33,560
Midas Resources has put together a powerful book titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold, discussing

976
01:22:33,560 --> 01:22:38,600
costs, benefits, risks, featuring full color illustrations, weights and measures. The book

is free and can be yours by calling 800-686-2237. Paper investments are dwarfed by gold's 6,000

year history. Discover how gold may be right for you and your IRA by calling 800-686-2237.

980
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:06,420
Hey there, Frank Bates here. Have you heard about the weird device that could wipe out

981
01:23:06,420 --> 01:23:12,520
280 million Americans? This is really scary stuff. Defense experts warn that this odd

982
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:17,800
device poses the gravest threat we've ever known. In fact, just a few weeks ago, former

983
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:21,880
Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich wrote an op-ed piece for the Washington Post warning

984
01:23:21,880 --> 01:23:26,700
about this deadly threat. I can't believe that more people aren't talking about this.

985
01:23:26,700 --> 01:23:31,420
It may be because the liberals and the government are trying to cover it up. That's why my friend

986
01:23:31,420 --> 01:23:37,520
just created a free video at weirddevice.com that exposes this threat and blows the doors

987
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:43,200
off the conspiracy. Go watch the shocking video at weirddevice.com right now to discover

988
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:48,400
exactly what it is, plus discover the number one way you and your family can survive this

989
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:53,640
deadly attack. I'm not sure how long this video will be online, so go to weirddevice.com

990
01:23:53,640 --> 01:24:02,520
before it's gone forever. Again, that's weirddevice.com.

991
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:12,880
Yeah, magically, these school shootings just started right as Obama isn't facing reelection

992
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:19,080
or honestly says he'll use executive orders. And if you look at the shootings out in Aurora,

993
01:24:19,080 --> 01:24:22,880
definitely had government involvement. The guy was paid under a DARPA program that was

994
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:25,440
in mind control, and that's back of the paper.

995
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:29,240
I mean, you can't make this up. I mean, Operation Northwoods, US government called for staging

996
01:24:29,240 --> 01:24:33,320
shootings in movie theaters and on the streets to blame their political enemies. Operation

997
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:37,320
Gladio declassified, our government did it all over Europe. We know about it cuz the

998
01:24:37,320 --> 01:24:41,860
Italian government declassified. They worked with NATO and the US government shooting up

999
01:24:41,860 --> 01:24:45,060
schools and things to blame political groups they didn't like.

1000
01:24:45,060 --> 01:24:50,200
It happened in every major European country. They're running Gladio, in my historical researched

1001
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:55,040
opinion. And now if this isn't gang related in Bakersfield, and my God, they could start

1002
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:57,960
announcing dozens of dead just like last time when they said it was one or two and then

1003
01:24:57,960 --> 01:25:00,720
it was two shot right now.

1004
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:07,440
I pray to God this isn't, but either way, they're hyping it, they're advertising, school

1005
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:12,920
shooting, school shooting, school shooting, school shooting. They know with copycats that

1006
01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:16,800
when they do TV shows about young girls cutting themselves, suddenly more girls cut themselves

1007
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:21,560
and then more cut themselves and then more. When they did death education in public schools

1008
01:25:21,560 --> 01:25:25,120
starting in 1990, suicide increased.

1009
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:27,800
Teaching 10 and 11 and 12 year olds how to commit suicide, they never even thought of

1010
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:32,280
that. It's like an option. You see, when they started advertising death by cop, people started

1011
01:25:32,280 --> 01:25:37,960
going out and pulling more guns on cops to get killed. It's called advertising. If people

1012
01:25:37,960 --> 01:25:42,920
ran $1 million of advertising on a local TV station saying it's fun to go to the corner

1013
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:46,680
of Washington and Liberty and beat yourself in the head with a hammer.

1014
01:25:46,680 --> 01:25:50,560
There would be people that went to that corner and beat themselves in the head with a hammer.

1015
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:55,680
There are some people that's suggestible. Most of us aren't like that. When somebody

1016
01:25:55,680 --> 01:25:59,320
jumps off a major building, the police always station people there for the next three days

1017
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:02,960
because somebody always shows up. And the police in the old days would call up the media

1018
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:05,480
and say, please stop reporting on this.

1019
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:10,840
When we had real terrorism in the 60s and 70s, they had policies where they did not

1020
01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:15,880
report on it at one time. Because when you report on it, it causes more of it. Gerald,

1021
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:19,440
I know I'm ranting and I've got you on here to talk. And we're gonna play some clips coming

1022
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:23,640
up with Ron Paul and moving to other issues that are very important.

1023
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:31,020
But I mean, the way they're hyping school shootings as an epidemic, it's going to cause

1024
01:26:31,020 --> 01:26:34,560
copycats to go in there and do this. They know exactly what they're doing. I mean, I

1025
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:39,000
went and took a few courses in media theory at a community college and they talked about

1026
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:44,320
this. I mean, certainly the masters running the media know what they're doing.

1027
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:51,080
But I agree with you 100%. It's advertising. And if this was buried on the back pages of

1028
01:26:51,080 --> 01:26:56,560
the New York Times, these incidents, rather than promoting them, they would have a very

1029
01:26:56,560 --> 01:27:03,160
different impact. For example, they just killed, quote, 10 militants over there in Pakistan.

1030
01:27:03,160 --> 01:27:07,720
That's not a front page story. It's a tiny little thing. It was a front page story. Obama

1031
01:27:07,720 --> 01:27:13,800
sends more drones to kill people that had been tried, never had went to court, never

1032
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:20,400
would charge with anything, against the Geneva Conventions and kept doing it over and over

1033
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:22,960
again. It would become news. So I agree with you.

1034
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:26,720
As we were going out of the break, and I'm talking about what's happening to the country

1035
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:31,920
on a broader level and the breakdown of the culture and all these people on psychotropic

1036
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:38,960
drugs, new study just came out. America, USA, USA, we're number one. We're number one. Guess

1037
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:45,400
what? New study just came out. We're in infant mortality. Yeah, we're near number one.

1038
01:27:45,400 --> 01:27:53,640
And narcissism. Narcissism, yeah, but the other one was, out of the top 17 nations,

1039
01:27:53,640 --> 01:28:03,720
we rank last in longevity, and we're ranking last in as far as people being healthy of

1040
01:28:03,720 --> 01:28:13,720
mind and body. And by the way, I was just thinking, any legislation that is being passed

1041
01:28:13,720 --> 01:28:21,720
now, what they say to stop this crisis from continuing, I want to see studies being done

1042
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:28,240
on it. I want to see studies being done that what they're proposing is in fact going to

1043
01:28:28,240 --> 01:28:35,040
work rather than them stealing my money, hiring a bunch of their flunky friends to make money

1044
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:38,520
on these new programs. Hey, remember that one they used to have in front of all the

1045
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:45,440
schools? Dare, dare. Yeah, that'll keep kids away with drugs. Who are the people making

1046
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:52,080
money behind that? So what I'm saying, Alex, before any new legislation is passed, there

1047
01:28:52,080 --> 01:28:57,260
should be cost benefit analyses done as to if this is going to work, how it's going to

1048
01:28:57,260 --> 01:28:59,360
work and what it's going to cost.

1049
01:28:59,360 --> 01:29:06,040
And your point that you keep making, do not stop making it. They are advertising this.

1050
01:29:06,040 --> 01:29:13,040
They are promoting it. It's what prestitudes do. They're standing out there and they're

1051
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:22,220
hawking it like any good prestitute would do. So they are creating the culture.

1052
01:29:22,220 --> 01:29:26,240
Long segment coming up with Gerald Salente. The Drudge Report had this up yesterday, but

1053
01:29:26,240 --> 01:29:29,440
I'm going to cover it after Gerald leaves. This is the most powerful article I've ever

1054
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:36,180
read on the Second Amendment. Americans never give up your guns from Pravda, from Russia.

1055
01:29:36,180 --> 01:29:40,280
And it is powerful, ladies and gentlemen. It's still actually up at DrudgeReport.com,

1056
01:29:40,280 --> 01:29:45,480
the middle column. We've reposted it at Infowars.com. And here's the bad news. Biden has just announced

1057
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:50,720
they're going to confiscate all guns that aren't registered. So that's coming up.

1058
01:29:50,720 --> 01:30:01,500
Here on the march, the empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

1059
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:06,360
Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive from natural disasters

1060
01:30:06,360 --> 01:30:10,920
like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on

1061
01:30:10,920 --> 01:30:15,880
by a disastrous economy? Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything. At eFoods

1062
01:30:15,880 --> 01:30:20,120
Direct, we hear from customers every day that are fortunate enough to weather a life storm

1063
01:30:20,120 --> 01:30:24,660
by having a supply of food on hand. After Hurricane Sandy, Danny from New York City

1064
01:30:24,660 --> 01:30:29,440
wrote, almost all of the grocery stores are closed, but I managed to get my eFoods just

1065
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:35,100
in time to be able to help my sister and niece. It is better to be prepared 10 years too early

1066
01:30:35,100 --> 01:30:39,680
than one day too late. I can warn you, but I can't feed you. Heed the warnings and do

Millions of people are going to get sick this winter from colds, flu, and other illnesses.

1091
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:25,600
We are all in the arena doing the best job we can to fight the globalist. Depending on

1092
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:28,840
how you look at it, I probably could have done a better job on Piers Morgan. I'll say

1093
01:33:28,840 --> 01:33:32,440
this, if they ever let me back on there, I will try to show the opposite side and be

1094
01:33:32,440 --> 01:33:36,480
very, very calm. Let me take five or six Valiums beforehand. I'm joking, I've never even taken

1095
01:33:36,480 --> 01:33:40,240
Valium and I'm told that's what people take to calm down.

1096
01:33:40,240 --> 01:33:43,600
But I was just angry. I'm sick of the lies. I know they're opportunistically trying to

1097
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:48,200
disarm us. They could care less about a million dead Iraqis in the Lancet Journal estimate.

1098
01:33:48,200 --> 01:33:52,320
They could care less about hundreds of dead kids a year. When they kill innocent people,

1099
01:33:52,320 --> 01:33:58,240
they just call it collateral damage. They could care less about fast and furious thousands

1100
01:33:58,240 --> 01:34:02,040
of dead people that this White House shipped guns into Mexico. Their own memos came out

1101
01:34:02,040 --> 01:34:05,180
to blame the Second Amendment, and it makes me mad.

1102
01:34:05,180 --> 01:34:11,240
And I'm just sick of everyone kissing their butts. And Larry Pratt went on there and destroyed

1103
01:34:11,240 --> 01:34:17,160
him last night. We'll play it last hour, but he won't make the news anywhere. Listen, they're

1104
01:34:17,160 --> 01:34:22,400
not having me back on other shows because they know it's breaking people out of their

1105
01:34:22,400 --> 01:34:26,720
spell. Sure, they're gonna spin it and say, look, this guy just credits gun owners because

1106
01:34:26,720 --> 01:34:29,000
that's one angle, and with some people it will.

1107
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:33,560
But the overall thing, it scares them for the sleeping giant to awaken. Trendsresearch.com

1108
01:34:33,560 --> 01:34:37,280
is Gerald's excellent site. We'll go to that and talk about some of the new trends coming

1109
01:34:37,280 --> 01:34:41,440
out after we finish up with guns here in a moment with Gerald Cilente. But first, I wanted

1110
01:34:41,440 --> 01:34:42,960
to get his take on Ron Paul.

1111
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:49,400
I brought up my quote of you're gonna trigger a new 1776, which I don't want physically.

1112
01:34:49,400 --> 01:34:54,520
Gerald and I have talked about a velvet cultural revolution of liberty versus their cultural

1113
01:34:54,520 --> 01:34:59,320
revolution of tyranny, a culture of Americana, quality. We're gonna talk some about that.

1114
01:34:59,320 --> 01:35:02,800
I'm clear, I don't want violence. Believe me, I'm one of the first they're gonna go

1115
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:08,640
after. But that's why I'm like, don't come for the guns, it will cause it.

1116
01:35:08,640 --> 01:35:13,320
And Piers is like, and like after the show, they're like, he wants some violent revolution.

1117
01:35:13,320 --> 01:35:18,160
You idiots don't get it. You're going to trigger it. You're going to draw first blood. You're

1118
01:35:18,160 --> 01:35:24,060
going to push it and push it and push it and push it and push it.

1119
01:35:24,060 --> 01:35:28,060
And I brought this up and Ron Paul said, well, I haven't used those words, but I say this

1120
01:35:28,060 --> 01:35:32,320
is the line in the sand. This could cause a revolution. Here's Ron Paul. So you think

1121
01:35:32,320 --> 01:35:35,880
I was right then telling Piers Morgan if they try to confiscate the guns, it will start

1122
01:35:35,880 --> 01:35:36,880
1776 part two.

1123
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:40,920
Well, I don't know whether I'd put them in the same words, but I think I said something

1124
01:35:40,920 --> 01:35:42,960
very similar to what you're saying.

1125
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:46,000
Well, God bless you, sir. I hope we can get you back again in a month.

1126
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:47,000
Bye, guys. Very good.

1127
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,800
What are any other websites that are important to plug? Just campaignforliberty.org.

1128
01:35:49,800 --> 01:35:54,960
Do that. And then we'll be listing some new things there because we're making some other

1129
01:35:54,960 --> 01:36:00,640
web page. I'm going to have a a home page. Unfortunately, I didn't have Ron Paul dot

1130
01:36:00,640 --> 01:36:01,640
com.

1131
01:36:01,640 --> 01:36:06,280
So I'm going to have to have Ron Ron Paul's home page dot com. That'll be coming up, but

1132
01:36:06,280 --> 01:36:07,280
it's not ready yet.

1133
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:09,920
All right. Big announcements coming soon. We'll talk to you and say hi to the family.

1134
01:36:09,920 --> 01:36:13,680
God bless you, sir. Thank you. Right to talk to that man during this dark time. I told

1135
01:36:13,680 --> 01:36:19,280
you executive. They're getting us ready to see if we'll take it. Ladies and gentlemen,

1136
01:36:19,280 --> 01:36:21,000
this could be it.

1137
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:29,520
All right. There is that clip with the audio off, but it doesn't matter for radio listeners.

1138
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:33,640
I have the news here. Bakersfieldnow.com. Bakersfield school officials take part in

1139
01:36:33,640 --> 01:36:40,200
shooting survival training. This is January 9th. They just had a drill at the school.

1140
01:36:40,200 --> 01:36:44,840
Now, whether that copycat did the shooting now there or whether that's used as a cover,

1141
01:36:44,840 --> 01:36:50,000
we know in North was other documents they use. They use drills as the cover for the

1142
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:51,960
real shooters.

1143
01:36:51,960 --> 01:36:56,300
And I'm telling you, ladies and gentlemen, they're so confident. I believe they're staging

1144
01:36:56,300 --> 01:36:59,680
and provocateuring these and you're going to see a bunch more shootings. That's why

1145
01:36:59,680 --> 01:37:04,560
they're so confident and why he's told fundraisers Biden will get the guns by the end of January

1146
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:08,680
and they're training local police federally for forced gun confiscation.

1147
01:37:08,680 --> 01:37:13,920
And Biden hints at outlawing unregulated private guns and saying that you can't have guns that

1148
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:18,040
aren't registered. Well, that's what Dianne Feinstein's bill says. Gerald, let me ask

1149
01:37:18,040 --> 01:37:25,920
you the question here, because it's very, very important. Again, I don't want a violent

1150
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:26,920
revolution.

1151
01:37:26,920 --> 01:37:31,480
But I'm not going to a FEMA camp either. So defensively, we have a right to protect ourselves

1152
01:37:31,480 --> 01:37:35,800
in the duty. What do you think is going to happen if they physically start trying to

1153
01:37:35,800 --> 01:37:40,320
confiscate all the semi-autos as Feinstein's bill says? And if they go out and start SWAT

1154
01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:44,200
teaming people and calling them terrorists who don't turn them in, what do you think

1155
01:37:44,200 --> 01:37:50,160
as a trans forecaster who's been so accurate, what do you think's going to come out of that?

1156
01:37:50,160 --> 01:37:54,640
You'll see the same kind of thing that happened during the prohibition. And it'll be another

1157
01:37:54,640 --> 01:38:01,000
industry that the government creates. It'll accomplish nothing and it'll be a failure.

1158
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:06,480
When you just read that statement by Biden, were you reading that out of a comic book?

1159
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:11,640
They're going to confiscate all unregistered guns? I mean, come on. Where are you going

1160
01:38:11,640 --> 01:38:18,320
to find them? In the unregistered gun dump? I mean, it's an oxymoron. How are you going

1161
01:38:18,320 --> 01:38:25,840
to confiscate unregistered guns? They're losers. Everything they turn, they do. They turn to

1162
01:38:25,840 --> 01:38:31,880
failure. And going back for a moment, by the way, on two things. One on the Piers Morgan

1163
01:38:31,880 --> 01:38:40,540
show about the revolution. I believe there's going to be a revolution, but I've come up

1164
01:38:40,540 --> 01:38:45,360
with something very different. And we're going to be announcing it within a few days and

1165
01:38:45,360 --> 01:38:52,000
I want to be on your show to talk about it more. Gerald Cilenti's Four Rules of Peace.

1166
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:59,840
That's right. Am I in favor of guns? You bet. Do I own them? You bet I do. If I'm going

1167
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:05,080
to have some crazy person blowing through my place like that woman did who was protecting

1168
01:39:05,080 --> 01:39:10,660
her children in the attic, what was it, in Georgia, and shot the intruder as the intruder

1169
01:39:10,660 --> 01:39:15,800
was going to shoot her, I want to have the will, I want to have the wherewithal to protect

1170
01:39:15,800 --> 01:39:22,640
myself. If I see society breaking down, let's say what happens, a nuclear power plant goes

1171
01:39:22,640 --> 01:39:31,000
berserk, and people turn into animals, and they try behaving like deranged, rabid animals,

1172
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:36,480
I want to have a weapon to protect myself. No kidding, exactly, as portions of the population

1173
01:39:36,480 --> 01:39:39,920
degenerate because they don't know how to work, everything's always been given to them,

1174
01:39:39,920 --> 01:39:44,360
first by their parents, then by the culture, plus the jobs are shipped overseas. As all

1175
01:39:44,360 --> 01:39:50,960
of this is happening, we have a right, a duty, a responsibility. Of course. And the other

1176
01:39:50,960 --> 01:39:59,320
thing, Alex, when they made, after you went off the air, and they sandbagged you there,

1177
01:39:59,320 --> 01:40:05,560
with that guy Dershowitz, they would talk about, oh, he's making this New World Order.

1178
01:40:05,560 --> 01:40:13,220
I want to make this clear to everybody. The New World Order is not a conspiracy theory.

1179
01:40:13,220 --> 01:40:21,040
It's a fact, and I could prove it. The New World Order is the banking order. That's right.

1180
01:40:21,040 --> 01:40:28,520
They are the ones responsible for so much of what's going on in society today. I could

1181
01:40:28,520 --> 01:40:34,000
pick up a piece, and we'll take it in the break, I'll get my assistant to get it, from

1182
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:42,800
the CEO of UBS, saying how arrogant they were, and how they shouldn't have been so greedy,

1183
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:48,560
in nice white shoe boy language. You look what's going on over in Europe. Instead of

1184
01:40:48,560 --> 01:40:54,360
them reporting on all of the prostitute news that they do, they're not talking about the

1185
01:40:54,360 --> 01:41:01,320
horrors that people are living through in Portugal, in Spain, in Greece. The people

1186
01:41:01,320 --> 01:41:08,160
are taking to the streets. You say, Alex, that can this be a tipping point? I don't

1187
01:41:08,160 --> 01:41:14,280
know what the tipping point is, because the tipping point, they never see it. They will

1188
01:41:14,280 --> 01:41:24,500
continue to rape us until their sickest desires have not been fulfilled in one area, as when

1189
01:41:24,500 --> 01:41:30,920
raping us of our constitutional rights, and then they'll do something else. They never

1190
01:41:30,920 --> 01:41:39,640
learn. Look, have they learned from Vietnam? Did they learn from Iraq? Have they learned

1191
01:41:39,640 --> 01:41:49,400
from Afghanistan? No, I got it. Let's open up 35 new bases in Africa. Yeah, we'll come

1192
01:41:49,400 --> 01:41:55,480
up with a name for it. They never learn.

1193
01:41:55,480 --> 01:42:00,120
You're right, and they know though, they have learned something from history that people

1194
01:42:00,120 --> 01:42:04,840
will resist them later. So they're buying 1.6 billion bullets. They're digging in, they're

1195
01:42:04,840 --> 01:42:10,000
militarizing, they're surveilling, they're calling peaceful protests, terrorism. Publicly,

1196
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:16,640
they're demonizing the entire Bill of Rights and Constitution. Meanwhile, they are erecting

1197
01:42:16,640 --> 01:42:17,640
all these new taxes.

1198
01:42:17,640 --> 01:42:20,760
Now, you originally were gonna come back on this week, and we appreciate you doing that

1199
01:42:20,760 --> 01:42:24,720
because I know you're a busy guy, to get into the big trends coming up that we didn't have

1200
01:42:24,720 --> 01:42:29,560
time to get to last week. Let's shift gears out of the guns now, and this Bakersfield

1201
01:42:29,560 --> 01:42:30,560
thing looks bad.

1202
01:42:30,560 --> 01:42:35,280
Another shooting at a school, a government training center, and they had a drill there

1203
01:42:35,280 --> 01:42:40,240
two days ago of a mass shooting at the school, practicing taking the kids to the sports stadium.

1204
01:42:40,240 --> 01:42:45,560
And they've actually done that now. This, again, just absolutely programs the youngsters

1205
01:42:45,560 --> 01:42:49,880
to think about this, and that this is an option.

1206
01:42:49,880 --> 01:42:52,680
They lose their girlfriend, they put them on Prozac, and they don't know what their

1207
01:42:52,680 --> 01:42:56,360
name is. Well, get a gun, I mean, this is unbelievable. But Gerald, shifting out of

1208
01:42:56,360 --> 01:43:01,800
the guns now, because you offered, you said I can come back and finish cuz we're out of

1209
01:43:01,800 --> 01:43:06,600
time. All the big trends that are coming up other than the disarmament, I mean, that's

1210
01:43:06,600 --> 01:43:07,600
one of them.

1211
01:43:07,600 --> 01:43:11,240
Why are they pushing so hard to disarm us right now? Because they know, I was reading

1212
01:43:11,240 --> 01:43:17,280
with the Chinese government starting to hoard food and weapons for itself against the population.

1213
01:43:17,280 --> 01:43:20,520
Governments everywhere are digging in, how does this tie into it?

1214
01:43:20,520 --> 01:43:27,320
That's exactly it. And that's exactly what we're writing about. There's an economic collapse

1215
01:43:27,320 --> 01:43:33,840
going on worldwide. They know, you pick up today's New York Times, or yesterday's, one

1216
01:43:33,840 --> 01:43:41,480
of the days, one of the members of the Federal Reserve Board from Virginia saying that all

1217
01:43:41,480 --> 01:43:48,840
of this quantitative easing is not going to solve anything. They know that the game is

1218
01:43:48,840 --> 01:43:55,220
going to end. And you know my say, when people lose everything and have nothing left to lose,

1219
01:43:55,220 --> 01:43:56,360
they lose it.

1220
01:43:56,360 --> 01:44:03,800
And I firmly believe that with the National Defense Authorization Act, with the wiretapping,

1221
01:44:03,800 --> 01:44:08,160
with all of the surveillance going on, as you pointed out what they did with the Occupy

1222
01:44:08,160 --> 01:44:17,000
movements, with the FBI, the CIA, the NIA, all of them watching everything that we do,

1223
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:23,600
and I'm not a conspiracy crazy. I'm seeing it as I'm watching the world collapse around

1224
01:44:23,600 --> 01:44:29,160
us and I'm saying they're preparing for the collapse here. And so they want to have it

1225
01:44:29,160 --> 01:44:36,180
so that they can control us. Again, just like they infiltrated the Occupy movement and every

1226
01:44:36,180 --> 01:44:42,780
other movement. They're going to do it again because we're going through an economic collapse

1227
01:44:42,780 --> 01:44:50,080
here. In fact, Switzerland, I used to call them the money cockroaches of the world. They

1228
01:44:50,080 --> 01:44:57,840
are now printing more money and a leverage of GDP to printing money higher than any of

1229
01:44:57,840 --> 01:45:05,040
the other countries. The new guy they got in there in Japan, Abe, the new prime minister,

1230
01:45:05,040 --> 01:45:10,440
first thing he did, they're printing more money through the Bank of Japan. You look

1231
01:45:10,440 --> 01:45:16,640
what's going on over in Europe with Mario Draghi, former vice chairman of the Goldman

1232
01:45:16,640 --> 01:45:24,040
Sachs gang. What is he doing? OMT, ongoing monetary transactions, in white shoe boy language,

1233
01:45:24,040 --> 01:45:30,640
in real language, keep printing money. Oh, gold, by the way, Alex, pop up $20 today.

1234
01:45:30,640 --> 01:45:35,800
Why? Because they're depressing it and if anybody doesn't think the game is rigged,

1235
01:45:35,800 --> 01:45:40,720
then you're a moron to think that they don't rig things because after all, didn't they

1236
01:45:40,720 --> 01:45:47,160
rig the interest rates with LIBOR? Aren't we finding out all these inside deals that

1237
01:45:47,160 --> 01:45:52,780
are going on? I'm making the point because it all ties together. There's an economic

1238
01:45:52,780 --> 01:45:58,120
collapse. The only way they're keeping it going is by printing this cheap money and

1239
01:45:58,120 --> 01:46:07,600
in the meantime, devaluing our currency. If anybody travels out of the United States and

1240
01:46:07,600 --> 01:46:17,440
goes to an affluent nation, your dollar isn't worth a dime, ladies and gentlemen. What's

1241
01:46:17,440 --> 01:46:23,760
going on is that this is part of the greater collapse and then you start putting the other

1242
01:46:23,760 --> 01:46:30,640
pieces together. Hey, drought conditions going on. Can't bring barges down the Mississippi.

1243
01:46:30,640 --> 01:46:37,600
Food prices going up. Oh, shortages. Hey, over there in Brazil, big problem. Can't get

1244
01:46:37,600 --> 01:46:44,640
any hydroelectricity. Why not? Things are drying up. Don't have the water. So you keep

1245
01:46:44,640 --> 01:46:54,240
putting this all together. The government, the nation is too big to operate from a central

1246
01:46:54,240 --> 01:47:02,520
location. What I would like to see as part of the next revolution is secession. I don't

1247
01:47:02,520 --> 01:47:11,400
want a gang of 535 telling 315 million people what to do. I don't want a guy like Biden

1248
01:47:11,400 --> 01:47:18,600
or boner. I don't want a person like Reid or McConnell. I don't want these losers who

1249
01:47:18,600 --> 01:47:27,120
have created nothing but misery and hardship for all of us except their friends to keep

1250
01:47:27,120 --> 01:47:31,800
destroying the nation. And when you look at the Bill of Rights and when you listen to

1251
01:47:31,800 --> 01:47:37,840
our founding fathers, this is the time for me for one of the big trends that we're writing

1252
01:47:37,840 --> 01:47:44,320
about the secession progression. You notice how they push that out of the news. You notice

1253
01:47:44,320 --> 01:47:50,560
how over a million people signed up for it and no one's talking about it, but it's going

1254
01:47:50,560 --> 01:47:56,960
on in Spain. It's going on in Italy. It's going on in Scotland. It's going on over 200

1255
01:47:56,960 --> 01:48:05,480
countries around the world. The nation is too broken to fix and it's too big to be operated

1256
01:48:05,480 --> 01:48:12,540
by a mafia, a Republican and Democratic crime family.

1257
01:48:12,540 --> 01:48:19,440
You can't reform criminals. No, you don't reform the mafia. We need a new system and

1258
01:48:19,440 --> 01:48:21,360
that's what I'm going for.

1259
01:48:21,360 --> 01:48:26,480
By the way, last week they had kicked him out. They had indicted some of them. I remember

1260
01:48:26,480 --> 01:48:32,080
three, four years ago we were told Iceland's bankrupt. The 400,000 people of the country

1261
01:48:32,080 --> 01:48:36,960
who are some of the wealthiest capital in the world, they now are all bankrupted. And

1262
01:48:36,960 --> 01:48:44,500
then it was reported by Reuters and others, just amazing information last week that they

1263
01:48:44,500 --> 01:48:45,800
actually arrested them.

1264
01:48:45,800 --> 01:48:49,880
Now at first we were told all the debt was the Icelandic peoples. It was something like

1265
01:48:49,880 --> 01:48:54,680
$50 billion. Then they said, okay, it's only 10 million, please pay it. Turned out 90 plus

1266
01:48:54,680 --> 01:48:58,640
percent was not even their own national debt. It wasn't even their own socialism, which

1267
01:48:58,640 --> 01:49:04,120
it wasn't. It was foreign British bank debt that their criminal government had signed

1268
01:49:04,120 --> 01:49:06,120
them on to.

1269
01:49:06,120 --> 01:49:12,320
They protested and refused the system and sabotaged it any way they could. And went

1270
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:19,600
on strikes for a year until they took the government over, they stormed the banks. And

1271
01:49:19,600 --> 01:49:23,760
then now they've arrested the people and they're going to prison. And the bankers are trying

1272
01:49:23,760 --> 01:49:25,320
to do dirty tricks to them now.

1273
01:49:25,320 --> 01:49:28,900
But the point is, at first England said, we're not gonna let flights out of Iceland come

1274
01:49:28,900 --> 01:49:33,480
here saying you're illegal. We're gonna seize your citizens' bank accounts, cuz a lot of

1275
01:49:33,480 --> 01:49:38,360
Icelanders use British banks. So they just counter-suit them. The mafia of the British

1276
01:49:38,360 --> 01:49:43,200
cartel, the biggest in the world, tried to say, our debt is your debt.

1277
01:49:43,200 --> 01:49:48,400
And the Icelanders said, you can literally go to Hades. These nice well-mannered folks

1278
01:49:48,400 --> 01:49:53,900
actually reverted back to being Vikings. Can't we follow the Icelandic model? Isn't it the

1279
01:49:53,900 --> 01:49:57,040
way out? Isn't that the key?

1280
01:49:57,040 --> 01:50:03,060
Absolutely, again, you're going to be receiving the Trends Journal next week. Another great

1281
01:50:03,060 --> 01:50:09,460
trend we have is the Great Awakening. It was a great awakening in this country prior to

1282
01:50:09,460 --> 01:50:13,960
the revolution. You read it in the works of Thomas Paine.

1283
01:50:13,960 --> 01:50:19,680
Part of the Great Awakening, first it began as a religious revival. And people realized

1284
01:50:19,680 --> 01:50:25,000
that their salvation was in their own hands. It wasn't from a hierarchy of a Church of

1285
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:31,660
England or anybody else. That you're responsible creating your own destiny, and you leave this

1286
01:50:31,660 --> 01:50:37,720
life in the way that you choose to leave it by the deeds that you do on Earth. That was

1287
01:50:37,720 --> 01:50:44,940
the awakening. It then became a second part of it, just as no longer genuflecting to the

1288
01:50:44,940 --> 01:50:45,940
head of the Church of England.

1289
01:50:45,940 --> 01:50:48,920
Hold on, this is key. We're gonna come back and get into this. That's right. And that's

1290
01:50:48,920 --> 01:50:52,280
why they're setting up all this tyranny worldwide, as Brzezinski wrote in his new book. They

1291
01:50:52,280 --> 01:50:56,860
know the Global Awakening is happening. Gerald Salente predicted it six years ago. Brzezinski

1292
01:50:56,860 --> 01:51:01,620
confirmed it this year. We'll be back.

1293
01:51:01,620 --> 01:51:06,260
This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.

1294
01:51:06,260 --> 01:51:10,600
Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.

1295
01:51:10,600 --> 01:51:14,920
Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company

1296
01:51:14,920 --> 01:51:19,960
allows you to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart

1297
01:51:19,960 --> 01:51:24,620
grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid

1298
01:51:24,620 --> 01:51:30,260
is dangerously overloaded. And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.

1299
01:51:30,260 --> 01:51:34,600
Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands

1300
01:51:34,600 --> 01:51:39,260
of families lose their power from weather-related onages. Number five, a solar power generator

1301
01:51:39,260 --> 01:51:43,460
provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar

1302
01:51:43,460 --> 01:51:47,520
power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can

1303
01:51:47,520 --> 01:51:54,300

In the U.S., one in every 50 homes will have a break-in this year. Burdlers call it smash

1306
01:52:11,480 --> 01:52:19,060
and grab. Police call it robbery. We call it avoidable. We are Fake TV, a simple electronic

1307
01:52:19,060 --> 01:52:25,440
device that can fool even professional burglars. Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet and simulates

1308
01:52:25,440 --> 01:52:30,160
the changing colors of a television. To a burglar, it looks like someone must be home

1309
01:52:30,160 --> 01:52:36,640
watching TV, so they'll likely move on to an easier target. At only $34.95, Fake TV

1310
01:52:36,640 --> 01:52:41,280
costs less than a month of most alarm monitoring plants. And it's perfect if you're traveling

1311
01:52:41,280 --> 01:52:53,560
or away from home. Order your Fake TV by calling 877-5FAKETV or go to faketv.com. That's 877-532-5388

1312
01:52:53,560 --> 01:52:58,240
or faketv.com. Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.

1313
01:52:58,240 --> 01:53:05,720
Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the bestselling book Cancer Step Outside the Box.

1314
01:53:05,720 --> 01:53:11,480
I want you to know some very important information. In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested

1315
01:53:11,480 --> 01:53:15,760
that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could

1316
01:53:15,760 --> 01:53:21,240
obtain this world-class healer. Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around

1317
01:53:21,240 --> 01:53:25,680
the world to keep people healthy. Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in

1318
01:53:25,680 --> 01:53:31,520
this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal

1319
01:53:31,520 --> 01:53:36,360
cells only without harming a single normal cell. If you want to stay healthy, now's your

1320
01:53:36,360 --> 01:53:40,520
chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders that

1321
01:53:40,520 --> 01:53:50,360
don't belong in your body. Call 1-866-VenusFly or order from Carnivora.com. That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A.com.

1322
01:53:50,360 --> 01:53:58,840
That's 1-866-836-8735, 1-866-VenusFly or visit Carnivora.com. Protect your immune system.

1323
01:53:58,840 --> 01:54:02,480
It's the only one you've got.

1324
01:54:02,480 --> 01:54:08,840
The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show because there's

1325
01:54:08,840 --> 01:54:23,040
a war on for your mind.

1326
01:54:23,040 --> 01:54:26,880
Ladies and gentlemen, here's the issue. We've got Gerald for two more segments. Really appreciate

1327
01:54:26,880 --> 01:54:33,280
him joining us. They came out and announced we're going to have an executive order, which

1328
01:54:33,280 --> 01:54:37,680
they'd said quietly before, where we can just ban semi-autos. And people said, no way, that's

1329
01:54:37,680 --> 01:54:41,880
unconstitutional. So then CNN, I was watching them today before the show started back there

1330
01:54:41,880 --> 01:54:46,000
in the coffee area, was going, it's just an executive order to use existing laws, but

1331
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:47,200
it's how we implement them.

1332
01:54:47,200 --> 01:54:51,260
This isn't unconstitutional. Don't be paranoid. They played a clip of Limbaugh saying this

1333
01:54:51,260 --> 01:54:57,000
is a tyrannical takeover. And I saw another newscast criticizing Drudge for putting Hitler

1334
01:54:57,000 --> 01:55:01,920
and Stalin up there. Well, they used executive action to take guns. That's what this is.

1335
01:55:01,920 --> 01:55:06,440
See, they're always, don't be radical, don't be radical. They're the ones that are radical.

1336
01:55:06,440 --> 01:55:14,160
And we've got to rise to their radicalness with our base rock common sense and say no.

1337
01:55:14,160 --> 01:55:18,660
Now Gerald Salente is covering something here of the utmost importance. And it is so important

1338
01:55:18,660 --> 01:55:22,880
for you to support Infowars.com, to buy the books, the videos, the magazines, the propure

1339
01:55:22,880 --> 01:55:27,920
water filters that blow the competition away, fluoride filters, all of it, Infowarshop.com.

1340
01:55:27,920 --> 01:55:31,920
I haven't even plugged that today. To go there, the Buy the Pro Gun t-shirts, the Infowars

1341
01:55:31,920 --> 01:55:36,480
t-shirts to meet like-minded people. To go to trendsresearch.com and subscribe there

1342
01:55:36,480 --> 01:55:37,480
as well.

1343
01:55:37,480 --> 01:55:43,560
Because even if you think you know all this, this is the type of magazine, the color magazine

1344
01:55:43,560 --> 01:55:48,520
with great graphics and everything that you wanna give people, executives, teachers, preachers,

1345
01:55:48,520 --> 01:55:53,280
the police chiefs that can really wake them up. You can also sign up for the free trends

1346
01:55:53,280 --> 01:55:58,720
alerts there at trendsresearch.com. But now is the time to support those of us.

1347
01:55:58,720 --> 01:56:03,640
And that's why I wish Glenn Beck wasn't attacking me and folks because I want to work with everybody,

1348
01:56:03,640 --> 01:56:08,760
okay, who wants basic liberty, left, right, center, libertarian. If you want basic bill

1349
01:56:08,760 --> 01:56:12,800
of rights and constitution, and if you realize we've been hijacked by foreign mega banks,

1350
01:56:12,800 --> 01:56:19,440
I'm your friend. I wanna work with everybody. None of us are perfect. All of us can be arm

1351
01:56:19,440 --> 01:56:24,160
share quarterbacks, but we better financially support Infowars.com.

1352
01:56:24,160 --> 01:56:28,600
We better support Gerald Cilente and his trends research. You better spread the word about

1353
01:56:28,600 --> 01:56:34,000
these broadcasting local AM and FMs because they won't always be here if you don't support.

1354
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,920
Now is the time. Gerald, get back into your great awakening.

1355
01:56:36,920 --> 01:56:42,880
Yes. And then after the religious part that people understood that their salvation was

1356
01:56:42,880 --> 01:56:48,280
in their own hands and their own mind and spirit, then it became as well, we're not

1357
01:56:48,280 --> 01:56:57,000
going to genuflect to the crown either. These people do not have a royal bloodline. They

1358
01:56:57,000 --> 01:57:04,280
have not been ordained by God to rule us. And that's the works of the Thomas Pains and

1359
01:57:04,280 --> 01:57:13,720
others that people revolted against the tyranny of the nobility. Well, guess what, Alex? It's

1360
01:57:13,720 --> 01:57:21,360
the great awakening 2.0. They don't ride around in their coaches and knock everybody over

1361
01:57:21,360 --> 01:57:29,240
like they used to when the royalty arrived. Now they have their SUVs, their motorcades.

1362
01:57:29,240 --> 01:57:37,040
They closed down the airspace, closed down the highways. Every one of these creeps. Now

1363
01:57:37,040 --> 01:57:44,960
they have their jumbo jets. That's their new coaches. And they salute to the surfs down

1364
01:57:44,960 --> 01:57:53,960
below they wave. It's a new royalty. It's the royalty that Mark Twain so despised. It's

1365
01:57:53,960 --> 01:58:02,160
the royalty that Jefferson wrote in his letters, how disgusting and how deranged and immoral

1366
01:58:02,160 --> 01:58:12,760
they were when he was over in Europe. We have a new royalty. They are our senators. They

1367
01:58:12,760 --> 01:58:20,600
are our congressmen. And our kings and queens have become the presidents and prime ministers

1368
01:58:20,600 --> 01:58:29,520
who, by royal, eat it. Our executive order will tell the rest of us surfs what to do

1369
01:58:29,520 --> 01:58:36,520
and how we should obey them. Because if we don't, they have the goon squads to make sure

1370
01:58:36,520 --> 01:58:51,880
that they do. Unbelievable. Stay there. You are listening to GCN. Visit GCNlive.com today.

1382
02:00:21,480 --> 02:00:29,040
Alex Jones.

1383
02:00:29,040 --> 02:00:39,440
Up on screen of your TV viewer, I have an image of Thomas Jefferson next to Nancy Pelosi,

1384
02:00:39,440 --> 02:00:47,200
Harry Reid and some of the other little globalist minions there. And imagine 235 plus years

1385
02:00:47,200 --> 02:00:52,200
later, these tyrants are trying to destroy what Thomas Jefferson helped get into place

1386
02:00:52,200 --> 02:00:55,840
and he was the main architect for those that don't know.

1387
02:00:55,840 --> 02:00:59,520
They are literally still trying to get rid of something that our forebears fought with

1388
02:00:59,520 --> 02:01:04,880
blood, sweat and tears and a lot of work to put into place. And that's why they spend

1389
02:01:04,880 --> 02:01:09,720
all day demonizing it. And I was just thinking about Gerald Salinas. I'm at the old royalty

1390
02:01:09,720 --> 02:01:14,780
that discussed to Jefferson and others. And then here is the new royalty saying by executive

1391
02:01:14,780 --> 02:01:19,400
decree, we'll do whatever we want. We'll spy on you. We'll kill you. We'll disappear you.

1392
02:01:19,400 --> 02:01:24,400
We'll have the goons come after you. We are right back in that same position. And it's

1393
02:01:24,400 --> 02:01:25,400
just amazing.

1394
02:01:25,400 --> 02:01:29,640
Absolutely amazing. Gerald Salinas, we got four minutes left. You got the floor.

1395
02:01:29,640 --> 02:01:36,880
And again, you are a voice of the great awakening. I mean, if anybody doubts it, you know, they

1396
02:01:36,880 --> 02:01:44,640
haven't been tuning in so much. And as I am and others, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, Ron Paul,

1397
02:01:44,640 --> 02:01:51,920
nothing has changed. There is a new royalty. I'm not making this up. Do you ever see these

1398
02:01:51,920 --> 02:01:59,720
people? Everywhere they go, there's red carpets and a bunch of flunkies either saluting, depending

1399
02:01:59,720 --> 02:02:04,720
on the country you're in, or dressed up in some moronic uniform.

1400
02:02:04,720 --> 02:02:10,000
And I'm saying to myself, who's paying for this? And then Obama bows to royalty. But

1401
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:15,520
who's paying for this garbage? Who's paying for all of these flunkies to get dressed up

1402
02:02:15,520 --> 02:02:21,840
in this uniform? I have a business. Get to work. What are you doing over here to salute

1403
02:02:21,840 --> 02:02:28,680
me when I walk in the door? Do they salute anybody? Here he comes. Roll out the red carpet.

1404
02:02:28,680 --> 02:02:35,000
Nothing has changed. Look how they talk down to us. Look how they tell us what we must

1405
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:43,120
believe, why we should believe it, and how we should behave. There's a new Great Awakening.

1406
02:02:43,120 --> 02:02:53,600
The Great Awakening 2.0 is going to precede the Second American Revolution. And again,

1407
02:02:53,600 --> 02:03:00,960
not one of guns and armies, but one of the mind and the spirit, the heart and the soul,

1408
02:03:00,960 --> 02:03:10,800
the dignity and the respect of the individual, not what we should be saying and taking orders

1409
02:03:10,800 --> 02:03:15,480
from our masters.

1410
02:03:15,480 --> 02:03:19,480
I agree with you. When you talk about royalty, the red carpet was for royalty. They even

1411
02:03:19,480 --> 02:03:25,640
have the guards around them holding up standards. They're telling us we are the emperors, we

1412
02:03:25,640 --> 02:03:30,600
are your owners, and they act just like old royal dictatorships. And they say they're

1413
02:03:30,600 --> 02:03:36,080
above the law, they're immune, you're a slave, they twist it all. And then they take old

1414
02:03:36,080 --> 02:03:42,440
ladies' houses, you see it in the news all the time, for some unpaid tax they can't pay

1415
02:03:42,440 --> 02:03:46,440
so that these guys could have $15 billion in the bank.

1416
02:03:46,440 --> 02:03:52,600
Exactly, the new royalty. Here's a quote from Thomas Paine. To the evil of monarchy, we

1417
02:03:52,600 --> 02:03:59,480
have added that of hereditary succession. Yeah, one Bush, another Bush, another Bush,

1418
02:03:59,480 --> 02:04:07,680
a Clinton, a Clinton, a Kennedy, a Kennedy. And as the first is the degradation and lessening

1419
02:04:07,680 --> 02:04:18,000
of ourselves. So the second claimed as a matter of right is an insult and imposition on posterity.

1420
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:25,320
For all men being originally equals, no one by birth could have a right to set up his

1421
02:04:25,320 --> 02:04:32,840
own family in perpetual preference to all others forever. And that's what they have

1422
02:04:32,840 --> 02:04:42,760
done. It's their seat of power. They have become the royalty. They are in charge. They

1423
02:04:42,760 --> 02:04:45,000
know what's best for us.

1424
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:49,480
Amazing. Gerald Zalenta, I hope to speak to you soon, trendsresearch.com. I'm Alex Jones,

1425
02:04:49,480 --> 02:04:54,000
one of the followers.com. We'll be right back with the main radio transmission, 11 AM to

1426
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:58,600
2 PM central every day. Find all Gerald's material and videos at his trends research

1427
02:04:58,600 --> 02:05:02,320
site. We'll be back.

1428
02:05:02,320 --> 02:05:07,000
Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our

1429
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:12,640
immunity and health. At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing

1430

1433
02:05:31,520 --> 02:05:36,320
gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and leave the silver

1434
02:05:36,320 --> 02:05:41,840
at the surface, but rather we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin nourishing

1435
02:05:41,840 --> 02:05:46,920
chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the

1436
02:05:46,920 --> 02:05:55,040
silver more effectively. Visit www.silverlungs.com and click on our store page to find what silver

1437
02:05:55,040 --> 02:06:01,800
based products are best for you. That's www.silverlungs.com.

1438
02:06:01,800 --> 02:06:06,640
Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive from natural disasters

1439
02:06:06,640 --> 02:06:11,220
like hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on

1440
02:06:11,220 --> 02:06:16,160
by a disastrous economy? Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything. At e Foods

1441
02:06:16,160 --> 02:06:20,380
direct, we hear from customers every day that are fortunate enough to weather life storm

1442
02:06:20,380 --> 02:06:24,920
by having a supply of food on hand. After hurricane Sandy, Danny from New York City

1443
02:06:24,920 --> 02:06:29,680
wrote almost all of the grocery stores are closed, but I managed to get my e foods just

1444
02:06:29,680 --> 02:06:35,360

1450
02:07:06,600 --> 02:07:12,280
economic system runs from bad to worse. The globalist model is to shut down societies

and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover. That's why we've assembled

1460
02:08:04,640 --> 02:08:13,640
live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.

1461
02:08:13,640 --> 02:08:36,760
All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live here today on this Thursday worldwide

1462
02:08:36,760 --> 02:08:43,560
transmission and I want to go through the different laundry list of clips that we have

1463
02:08:43,560 --> 02:08:49,640
here today. In fact, guys, I had my list. Here it is. I want to first give out the number.

1464
02:08:49,640 --> 02:08:54,760
If you heard Doug Hagman on earlier from Northeast Intelligence Network or you just heard Gerald

1465
02:08:54,760 --> 02:08:59,000
Salente on the broadcast or you want to give your take on them saying they want to use

1466
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:01,340
executive orders to take our firearms.

1467
02:09:01,340 --> 02:09:05,400
That's the issues we're mainly talking about. Or the Democrats are proposing even more tax

1468
02:09:05,400 --> 02:09:09,520
increases now that they just got the other tax increases through. And this is how it

1469
02:09:09,520 --> 02:09:13,680
works. Once they get you to the cliff, they start raising taxes once a year, then it's

1470
02:09:13,680 --> 02:09:16,520
three times a year, then it's ten times a year.

1471
02:09:16,520 --> 02:09:23,440
And then you're paying 80% to 90% is the IMF World Bank model of everything you do in different

1472
02:09:23,440 --> 02:09:28,400
taxes and the streets aren't fixed, sewage is everywhere, but almost all your money goes

1473
02:09:28,400 --> 02:09:32,560
to the government. They're like, yeah, but their tax receipts go down when they do that.

1474
02:09:32,560 --> 02:09:35,880
They don't care. In fact, they want to make you poor.

1475
02:09:35,880 --> 02:09:41,560
And so McClatchy newspapers reporting that. There's a really creepy article. Could Alex

1476
02:09:41,560 --> 02:09:46,880
Jones revolution actually happen out of Yahoo News? And it goes on to admit the government's

1477
02:09:46,880 --> 02:09:51,080
arming against us and building up and that it's creepy. And if they try to take the guns,

1478
02:09:51,080 --> 02:09:54,000
there may be a revolution.

1479
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:58,920
But it also tries to discredit me. Look, it's not Alex Jones' revolution. I know a few months

1480
02:09:58,920 --> 02:10:02,640
ago I said, get ready, this is it, they're coming after us. They're saying they're gonna

1481
02:10:02,640 --> 02:10:07,200
use executive orders to take all our liberties. I can tell by their bearing and the propaganda

1482
02:10:07,200 --> 02:10:14,000
and all these new shows coming out on ABC, NBC, CBS, that the fix was in for Obama.

1483
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:21,280
And that they are gonna demonize gun owners. I mean, they don't have four new shows on

1484
02:10:21,280 --> 02:10:29,000
broadcast TV. And then a couple I know of on cable that are now out or coming out where

1485
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:33,520
gun owners are terrorists and the US Army hunts them down and infiltrates them. And

1486
02:10:33,520 --> 02:10:36,720
it puts them in situations where the gun owners are always bad guys.

1487
02:10:36,720 --> 02:10:40,920
It follows total Homeland Security scripting where they say gun owners, veterans, returning

1488
02:10:40,920 --> 02:10:45,760
vets, libertarians, conservatives are the enemy. And then their training, the real trainings

1489
02:10:45,760 --> 02:10:51,240
for this war going on for a decade, even before Obama got in. And now they're just going,

1490
02:10:51,240 --> 02:10:58,840
public with it. And so I mean, you'd be a fool if you didn't know they're not spending,

1491
02:10:58,840 --> 02:11:03,620
let's be conservative, 50, 60 billion a year for this domestic takeover.

1492
02:11:03,620 --> 02:11:08,160
And buying 1.6 billion bullets and deploying armored vehicles in every area and creating

1493
02:11:08,160 --> 02:11:13,320
dissonant list because they're not gonna come after us. They're gonna hammer down. I mean,

1494
02:11:13,320 --> 02:11:21,320
it's horrible. I wish this wasn't the case. And they mean to break this country. They

1495
02:11:21,320 --> 02:11:22,920
mean to bring this country completely down.

1496
02:11:22,920 --> 02:11:26,440
And I just pray to God to open the eyes of this country. I pray to God to open the eyes

1497
02:11:26,440 --> 02:11:30,360
of police and military, which is starting to happen. But they select goons out of these

1498
02:11:30,360 --> 02:11:35,080
forces and put them in these special thug units. And I've looked in their eyes. They

1499
02:11:35,080 --> 02:11:40,400
really can't wait to hunt us down. And good luck. I mean, you may get the first few of

1500
02:11:40,400 --> 02:11:46,680
us, people like me. But man, all you're doing is just really setting up for something bad.

1501
02:11:46,680 --> 02:11:52,160
And not just on this plane. Going after people that really do love liberty and are good guys

1502
02:11:52,160 --> 02:12:00,400
is bad mojo. Reap what you sow, karma, whatever you wanna call it. And this is really bad.

1503
02:12:00,400 --> 02:12:06,560
This is the worst scenario I could imagine. And it's not a game. It's not about entertainment.

1504
02:12:06,560 --> 02:12:10,280
It's time to get freaked out. Glenn Beck said, I'm spooky, I'm scary.

1505
02:12:10,280 --> 02:12:16,120
I'm dangerous. No, I'm covering the spookiness and the dangerousness that's already there,

1506
02:12:16,120 --> 02:12:20,960
bud. The time of wearing designer sweaters and being a cutesy and being into being a

1507
02:12:20,960 --> 02:12:27,340
rich guy, it's over. Look, you either leave the United States and try to run to where

1508
02:12:27,340 --> 02:12:29,360
rich people live if you're rich.

1509
02:12:29,360 --> 02:12:33,360
And just hope they don't get you later or you stand and you get the word out now. Okay,

1510
02:12:33,360 --> 02:12:38,800
cuz if we wait till they blow up some federal buildings and blame us, we're in deep trouble.

1511
02:12:38,800 --> 02:12:42,920
And I can tell you, I see all the signs. That's like I told you back days after Obama got

1512
02:12:42,920 --> 02:12:49,600
elected. I call for the second American Revolution, a restoration. There are a lot of revolutions.

1513
02:12:49,600 --> 02:12:57,580
Most of them aren't physical. I said before they, before the establishment, gets physical.

1514
02:12:57,580 --> 02:13:03,060
We have got to just absolutely overwhelm them and let them know we're on the watch and that

1515
02:13:03,060 --> 02:13:07,600
this isn't gonna work. And that means not letting those of us on the tip of the spear

1516
02:13:07,600 --> 02:13:09,480
be intimidated.

1517
02:13:09,480 --> 02:13:15,680
All of you that have a platform have got to turbocharge. I gotta give credit again, DrudgeReport.com

1518
02:13:15,680 --> 02:13:21,900
yesterday showed Hitler and Stalin and said Obama is trying to become a dictator with

1519
02:13:21,900 --> 02:13:25,480
executive orders. And look, if you have an executive order, I wanna play the Ron Paul

1520
02:13:25,480 --> 02:13:29,520
clip here in a moment, the HD one we now have, talking about the martial law is the first

1521
02:13:29,520 --> 02:13:32,600
clip we're gonna play or the line in the sand.

1522
02:13:32,600 --> 02:13:36,640
Ron Paul's like, well, it is dictatorial and it's going a dictatorial direction. But Obama

1523
02:13:36,640 --> 02:13:42,200
was elected, yeah, through fraud. It doesn't matter, Hitler was elected. I actually disagreed

1524
02:13:42,200 --> 02:13:46,760
with Ron Paul only slightly. He said, well, we're going in the direction of a dictatorship.

1525
02:13:46,760 --> 02:13:50,720
No, we're not. And I know he understands, he's real smart. He knows the public doesn't

1526
02:13:50,720 --> 02:13:51,720
get that.

1527
02:13:51,720 --> 02:13:55,340
They think as long as you're elected, you're not a dictator. If you got elected and overthrew

1528
02:13:55,340 --> 02:14:00,440
your office and did things outside of the office, like saying the UN's over our military

1529
02:14:00,440 --> 02:14:06,200
and I can sign executive orders and take your guns, that is dictator. Hitler was elected.

1530
02:14:06,200 --> 02:14:11,800
A lot of dictators, Hugo Chavez was elected. And there was pure fraud. The guy has not

1531
02:14:11,800 --> 02:14:20,080
been reelected. Fidel Castro was popular at first. This guy's still a dictator. The

1532
02:14:20,080 --> 02:14:22,160
point is Hitler was elected.

1533
02:14:22,160 --> 02:14:27,480
And Ron Paul said, well, we're going in the direction of a dictatorship. No, the office

1534
02:14:27,480 --> 02:14:31,800
of the President is becoming dictatorial, that is true. And it is going into dictator

1535
02:14:31,800 --> 02:14:36,760
territory and then it goes the rest of the way very, very quickly. But Ron Paul said

1536
02:14:36,760 --> 02:14:40,840
when I said, is 1776 not about to happen again?

1537
02:14:40,840 --> 02:14:44,440
Won't that be the line in the sand out of 100 plus million gun owners? Won't there be

1538
02:14:44,440 --> 02:14:48,240
1% that stands up or more? That's a million people fighting back. And he goes, yes, I've

1539
02:14:48,240 --> 02:14:52,520
always said that's the line in the sand. That's what's gonna kick this off. I mean, I'm not

1540
02:14:52,520 --> 02:14:57,080
saying, hey, Piers Morgan, there's gonna be 1776, we're coming to get you.

1541
02:14:57,080 --> 02:15:02,400
I'm saying do not hit the red button, buddy. Just like Larry Pratt told him last night,

1542
02:15:02,400 --> 02:15:07,400
we're gonna play that clip. He said, listen, I would tell Obama don't make the mistake

1543
02:15:07,400 --> 02:15:11,800
King George III made, don't come for the guns, it will happen. And Larry Pratt said, so you're

1544
02:15:11,800 --> 02:15:13,640
for revolution.

1545
02:15:13,640 --> 02:15:18,440
Or Piers Morgan said that to Larry Pratt. Larry Pratt said, listen, I'm telling you

1546
02:15:18,440 --> 02:15:25,160
what's going to happen. It's like don't run out on I-35 with 80 mile an hour, 18 wheelers,

1547
02:15:25,160 --> 02:15:28,600
back to back going down. Don't just stand there when one drives by and jump out in front

1548
02:15:28,600 --> 02:15:30,200
of it and think you're not gonna get run over.

1549
02:15:30,200 --> 02:15:35,320
What, are you gonna run me over? What, are you threatening me? No, idiot. Listen, don't

1550
02:15:35,320 --> 02:15:48,080
do this. Don't do this. Don't do it. Don't do it. 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231. And it's

1551
02:15:48,080 --> 02:15:51,680
not that we're, people are like, well, Alex, I know bad times are coming.

1552
02:15:51,680 --> 02:15:54,760
We're just gonna have to turn the guns in. We know it's tyranny, we'll have to bide our

1553
02:15:54,760 --> 02:15:59,760
time. Look, Biden, our time's over. They're getting ready to raise taxes again and again

1554
02:15:59,760 --> 02:16:04,160
and again. You're like, well, that'll bankrupt things. That's the plan, Jack. There's gotta

1555
02:16:04,160 --> 02:16:06,400
be a time, people are like, well, this is scary.

1556
02:16:06,400 --> 02:16:11,940
I'm not the one making it scary, Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh. I'm not the one making

1557
02:16:11,940 --> 02:16:18,200
it scary. They did, they did it. Okay, I'm following the Bill of Rights Constitution.

1558
02:16:18,200 --> 02:16:22,820
The globalists call us counter revolutionaries. They're involved in the revolutionary change.

1559
02:16:22,820 --> 02:16:30,960
They're the ones coming in doing this. They're the ones bringing in globalism. And excuse

1560
02:16:30,960 --> 02:16:38,720
me, I am an honorable person trying to do the best job I can, pouring out my very substance

1561
02:16:38,720 --> 02:16:43,080
to really historically try to do the right thing and back these people off.

1562
02:16:43,080 --> 02:16:45,860
Because again, I'll be honest with you, if they were just a corrupt group that wanted

1563
02:16:45,860 --> 02:16:50,840
to run stuff, I'd still be criticizing them and fighting them. Everybody has this feeling

1564
02:16:50,840 --> 02:16:54,120
of unease. Everybody says, yeah, we agreed things and we knew that we get bad and now

1565
02:16:54,120 --> 02:16:57,360
it's happening because God's warning you, folks.

1566
02:16:57,360 --> 02:17:05,520
These are nasty mass takeover FEMA camp, reeducator, total takeover types, and it's all on record.

1567
02:17:05,520 --> 02:17:09,240
But the mainline conservative talk show hosts all attack me and say that isn't true when

1568
02:17:09,240 --> 02:17:15,400
it's all on record. The army manuals, the FEMA camps, the emergency centers establishment

1569
02:17:15,400 --> 02:17:22,620
attacks. I'm giving you names of things that are public.

1570
02:17:22,620 --> 02:17:27,680
Let's go to the Ron Paul clip. Here it is, 800-25. So you think I was right then telling

1571
02:17:27,680 --> 02:17:29,960
Piers Morgan if they try to confiscate the guns it will stop.

1572
02:17:29,960 --> 02:17:33,000
Just stop it. I'll go to the clip here in a moment. I just want to give the number out.

1573
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:39,400
It's 800-259-9231. Sorry guys, I said go to it and sort of give the number out. Let's

1574
02:17:39,400 --> 02:17:43,320
go back to the clip now. Here it is. So you think I was right then telling Piers Morgan

1575
02:17:43,320 --> 02:17:46,560
if they try to confiscate the guns, it will start 1776 part two.

1576
02:17:46,560 --> 02:17:50,520
Well, I don't know whether I put them in the same words, but I think I said something very

1577
02:17:50,520 --> 02:17:54,600
similar to what you're saying. Well, God bless you, sir. I hope we can get you back again

1578
02:17:54,600 --> 02:17:56,160
in a month. Very good.

1579
02:17:56,160 --> 02:17:59,320
What are any other websites that are important to plug? Just campaignforliberty.org. That's

1580
02:17:59,320 --> 02:18:04,800
the short clip. And there's a full clip right before that that we should probably hear on

1581
02:18:04,800 --> 02:18:09,680
the nightly news tonight. The full clip's up on info-words.com where he talked about

1582
02:18:09,680 --> 02:18:15,120
the line in the sand being the gun. So there's a full part. Okay, so we're gonna play that

1583
02:18:15,120 --> 02:18:17,880
later once we find that because it's so important.

1584
02:18:17,880 --> 02:18:22,560
Sure, we'll go ahead and play it now. Go ahead. Will you turn in your semi-autos?

1585
02:18:22,560 --> 02:18:30,680
Well, I might not even have anything to turn in for that purpose, but I don't think the

1586
02:18:30,680 --> 02:18:36,840
American people will. I've always assumed that the line in the sand may well be drawn.

1587
02:18:36,840 --> 02:18:42,080
If the federal agent marches in unannounced and they say, well, give me your gun and give

1588
02:18:42,080 --> 02:18:50,740
me your gold, I don't think we'll do that calmly. I think the American people will highly

1589
02:18:50,740 --> 02:18:52,800
resent it and resist.

1590
02:18:52,800 --> 02:19:00,260
Yeah, I mean, this isn't a game. We've got radical Marxist hired by foreign banks. By

1591
02:19:00,260 --> 02:19:04,320
the way, it is the most incredible article I've ever read, and I will read this after

1592
02:19:04,320 --> 02:19:10,320
I take some calls. This Pravda article that we've posted in full, and probably used to

1593
02:19:10,320 --> 02:19:14,720
be the total Soviet mouthpiece, now it's the opposite, probably used to be known as a joke

1594
02:19:14,720 --> 02:19:16,160
of lying media.

1595
02:19:16,160 --> 02:19:21,560
And it comes out and says, the banks that have hijacked your country put Stalin first

1596
02:19:21,560 --> 02:19:26,380
Lenin in here and took our guns. We were just like you, we all had rifles and shotguns.

1597
02:19:26,380 --> 02:19:31,280
And we fought back, we were the White Russians and they killed us. And Pravda says, the same

1598
02:19:31,280 --> 02:19:35,920
banks. I actually got tears in my eyes reading it this morning. I saw it yesterday and didn't

1599
02:19:35,920 --> 02:19:41,960
read it. And I know the history is true and here are the Russians, the Russians saying

1600
02:19:41,960 --> 02:19:45,760
you're run by big banks, they're gonna take your guns, they're gonna kill you.

1601
02:19:45,760 --> 02:19:50,700
Your banks did this to us in 1917, America, watch out, they're gonna put you in camps,

1602
02:19:50,700 --> 02:19:57,240
they're gonna kill you. I mean, it is incredible information. I'm gonna read this on air, it

1603
02:19:57,240 --> 02:20:01,840
is so incredible.

1604
02:20:01,840 --> 02:20:08,240
Hello I'm Alex Jones, myself, my family, the Infowars.com team want to relay to you and

1605
02:20:08,240 --> 02:20:14,480
your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalist on every front.

1606
02:20:14,480 --> 02:20:20,120
Infowars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats, but we can't do that without

1607
02:20:20,120 --> 02:20:21,120
your help.

1608
02:20:21,120 --> 02:20:26,360
By getting the films, bumper stickers and t-shirts at Infowars.com, you will wake up

1609
02:20:26,360 --> 02:20:32,920
people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level. We need your

1610
02:20:32,920 --> 02:20:38,520
help to spread the word like never before. They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic

1611
02:20:38,520 --> 02:20:42,080
battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.

1612
02:20:42,080 --> 02:20:49,540
You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization

1613
02:20:49,540 --> 02:20:58,560
and ultimate extermination. The war is here. It's an info war. The spirit of 1776 versus

1614
02:20:58,560 --> 02:21:01,600
the mindset of 1984.

1615
02:21:01,600 --> 02:21:05,440
My name is Stephen Heuer. After 22 years of nutritional counseling, I've observed that

1616
02:21:05,440 --> 02:21:10,160
most brain malfunctions have at their roots some form of toxicity and brain damage. So

1617
02:21:10,160 --> 02:21:14,260
whether it is poor memory, poor focus, lack of creative thinking or more serious matters

1618
02:21:14,260 --> 02:21:18,660
like inability to focus, speak normally or remember things, the emphasis to getting one's

1619
02:21:18,660 --> 02:21:23,680
brain working optimally needs to be on detoxification. One World Way supports your body's number

1620
02:21:23,680 --> 02:21:27,200
one means of detoxification, which is glutathione production.

1621
02:21:27,200 --> 02:21:32,200
My name is Angie and my son has suffered from borderline autism and constipation. I got

1622
02:21:32,200 --> 02:21:37,640
him on One World Way and in two months his constipation is gone. He has become friendlier.

1623
02:21:37,640 --> 02:21:42,000
He can carry on a normal conversation with me and he has made his first friend. He's

1624
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:46,520
doing great and he looks forward to taking One World Way every day. He could offer him

1625
02:21:46,520 --> 02:21:50,440
a present or a cake and he would prefer the One World Way.

1626
02:21:50,440 --> 02:22:01,440
Go to oneworldway.com. That's oneworldwhey.com or call 888-988-3325. That's 888-988-3325.

1632
02:22:30,560 --> 02:22:35,000
Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered why banks, stock workers, investment advisors

1633
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:40,120
won't talk about gold IRAs? They've been available since 1986 yet the financial industry won't

1634
02:22:40,120 --> 02:22:44,680
recognize the value of gold for your retirement. Gold is outperformed paper investments yet

1635
02:22:44,680 --> 02:22:51,240
no word about IRAs. If you would like to have gold for your retirement call 800-686-2237.

1636
02:22:51,240 --> 02:22:57,080
Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns call 800-686-2237. Secure

1637
02:22:57,080 --> 02:23:04,040
your future and call 1-800-686-2237. Hi there. My name is Frank Bates. What I'm about to

1638
02:23:04,040 --> 02:23:08,540
tell you in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble. I just created a free

1639
02:23:08,540 --> 02:23:14,680
video presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity monopolies and government

1640
02:23:14,680 --> 02:23:19,480
agencies for what they really are. Incompetent line crooks that are counting on your ignorance

1641
02:23:19,480 --> 02:23:25,520
and fear to keep your power bills criminally high. Some have called this a conspiracy.

1642
02:23:25,520 --> 02:23:30,240
Others have called it a cover up and you will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy

1643
02:23:30,240 --> 02:23:36,840
goes. My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat

1644
02:23:36,840 --> 02:23:41,400
them and how you can beat them too. Watch the controversial video that thousands of

1645
02:23:41,400 --> 02:23:46,720
other smart patriots have already seen in the last three months. Go to 123coverup.com and

1646
02:23:46,720 --> 02:23:52,080
discover one weird trick to slash your power bill and protect your home. Go watch my video

1647
02:23:52,080 --> 02:23:59,520
now at 123coverup.com before they force me to shut it down. Again, that's 123coverup.com.

1648
02:23:59,520 --> 02:24:09,040
I want to say something to everybody. I want to thank those of you that have prayed for

1649
02:24:09,040 --> 02:24:12,640
us. I want to thank those of you that have supported us. I want to thank all of you that

1650
02:24:12,640 --> 02:24:16,120
have put up with me over the years because you know, in your discernment, I'm just doing

1651
02:24:16,120 --> 02:24:20,720
the best job I can. And I don't think I always have the answers. In fact, I know I don't.

1652
02:24:20,720 --> 02:24:27,560
I make a lot of mistakes and I'm just fighting as hard as I can. And that's all I can do.

1653
02:24:27,560 --> 02:24:34,360
That's all I can do. And I get very angry at the globalist because I know who they are.

1654
02:24:34,360 --> 02:24:39,120
And I, at a selfish level, I'm very mad that it's in my blood and that I can't help but

1655
02:24:39,120 --> 02:24:44,960
resist them. I mean, I've tried to think about before backing off and I just, it just feels

1656
02:24:44,960 --> 02:24:50,400
so horrible that I just can't do it. And then I realized things are just going to get worse

1657
02:24:50,400 --> 02:24:55,520
and then I get really angry because I'm not backing off. My ancestors didn't back down.

1658
02:24:55,520 --> 02:25:00,120
I'm not backing down. And the only reason we've had wealth and liberty and freedom and

1659
02:25:00,120 --> 02:25:08,520
lived the longest and had the most money was because our ancestors were meaner than rattlesnakes.

1660
02:25:08,520 --> 02:25:14,780
And a grizzly bear. And acting like a bunch of sheep, you're going to have wolves come.

1661
02:25:14,780 --> 02:25:19,200
And that's all I can say. I mean, we act like a bunch of cowards and bow down to government

1662
02:25:19,200 --> 02:25:27,040
like it's royalty. We're going to get treated like slaves. And that's why I'm so angry.

1663
02:25:27,040 --> 02:25:32,400
Is because I realized I've been around about all this and then some and it really is upsetting.

1664
02:25:32,400 --> 02:25:35,760
I know why people want to think things aren't as bad as I say, because then you'd have to

1665
02:25:35,760 --> 02:25:39,720
do something about it, wouldn't you? And I know there's a lot of you out there doing

1666
02:25:39,720 --> 02:25:44,040
a lot and you can't get through to me and you try to call and I whatever and you get

1667
02:25:44,040 --> 02:25:46,400
mad at me because you've got an idea that would fix everything.

1668
02:25:46,400 --> 02:25:54,280
Look, I'm totally overwhelmed. Okay, I can't do it all. And I try to take time off. I try

1669
02:25:54,280 --> 02:25:58,920
to rest. I try to not get angry. And I did probably need to take a vacation. I'll be

1670
02:25:58,920 --> 02:26:02,960
honest with people because I never take off. Any race car has got to pull over and get

1671
02:26:02,960 --> 02:26:06,720
its oil changed and get new tires on it and stuff. I'm only a human.

1672
02:26:06,720 --> 02:26:12,240
But I do appreciate all the prayers and things. But I told you, I feel this quickening coming

1673
02:26:12,240 --> 02:26:16,860
and see it building the last few months and now you see it all happening. My gut now it's

1674
02:26:16,860 --> 02:26:25,080
ten times what it was a week ago. It's just man, we're in trouble. And I just want to

1675
02:26:25,080 --> 02:26:26,080
turn things around.

1676
02:26:26,080 --> 02:26:31,560
I just don't want us to be taken over by pure authoritarians. Jacobson just gave me an article

1677
02:26:31,560 --> 02:26:36,980
about searches the examiner reports as liberals proposed gun control, Google searches on Hitler

1678
02:26:36,980 --> 02:26:42,360
gun control spike. One of the top searches yesterday because Drudge told it like it was.

1679
02:26:42,360 --> 02:26:46,960
When I saw this yesterday, I said that's the spirit. Putting Stalin and Hitler up there

1680
02:26:46,960 --> 02:26:51,040
where Obama was talking about using executive orders to take our guns.

1681
02:26:51,040 --> 02:26:56,280
Why is that so powerful? Because you've got to be radical in the face of their radicalism.

1682
02:26:56,280 --> 02:27:02,040
You've got to tell them where this is leading. Because they are radicals and they tell us,

1683
02:27:02,040 --> 02:27:06,960
don't be radical. Don't be radical that discredits you. No, you're the radicals and extremists

1684
02:27:06,960 --> 02:27:12,160
in defense of liberty is no vice, as Barry Goldwater said.

1685
02:27:12,160 --> 02:27:18,840
Laying down to charity is not golden, it's yellow. Silence isn't golden, it's yellow.

1686
02:27:18,840 --> 02:27:23,480
Like somebody pee in their pants. That's what cowards do and they get real scared. They

1687
02:27:23,480 --> 02:27:27,720
fall down. Don't hurt me and pee on themselves. I'm not gonna do that, man. I don't know how

1688
02:27:27,720 --> 02:27:38,240
to do that. Let's go to phone calls. I'll come back in the break, take more. Let's talk

1689
02:27:38,240 --> 02:27:41,080
to Glenn in Michigan. Glenn, you're on the air, go ahead.

1690
02:27:41,080 --> 02:27:42,080
Hey buddy.

1691
02:27:42,080 --> 02:27:47,120
Alex, it's a privilege to be on the phone with you. You can count on our prayers up

1692
02:27:47,120 --> 02:27:55,280
here in Michigan. And I just want to tell you, I want to encourage you, what you're

1693
02:27:55,280 --> 02:28:00,160
going through and what's happened reminds me so much of what happened, the situation

1694
02:28:00,160 --> 02:28:07,520
with a family member of mine who was Thanksgiving. I'm a little nervous, sorry Alex. But I'm

1695
02:28:07,520 --> 02:28:13,920
a reluctantly confrontational person. I've had to confront a member of my family that

1696
02:28:13,920 --> 02:28:25,040
I love so much, an alcoholic. And I prayed about what to say. And to be honest with you,

1697
02:28:25,040 --> 02:28:33,600
God gave me words to say to him, but it came out very brutal. And really wrecked our Thanksgiving,

1698
02:28:33,600 --> 02:28:44,800
if you want to say that. The family was mad at me, but that guy has given his life to

1699
02:28:44,800 --> 02:28:47,560
Christ and he has got a drink, so.

1700
02:28:47,560 --> 02:28:51,640
Absolutely, you did an intervention. Instead of watching your brother or whoever it was

1701
02:28:51,640 --> 02:28:56,240
drink themselves to death. It was like an intervention with Piers Morgan. They were

1702
02:28:56,240 --> 02:29:00,920
crying, none of the national TVs invited me on. They're totally freaked out, because they

1703
02:29:00,920 --> 02:29:05,320
all know it's about enslavement. And I'm like, look, you don't care about these kids, you

1704
02:29:05,320 --> 02:29:06,320
want tyranny.

1705
02:29:06,320 --> 02:29:10,680
Watch it, you're on notice. And that scared a lot of mainline conservatives, cuz they

1706
02:29:10,680 --> 02:29:15,840
all deep down know where this is headed. Hey folks, only admitting how real it is, is gonna

1707
02:29:15,840 --> 02:29:23,440
save us. I hope everybody gets that. My pastor has told me for years when you speak the truth

1708
02:29:23,440 --> 02:29:29,760
to somebody and confront them, it's like holding up a mirror to them and showing them what

1709
02:29:29,760 --> 02:29:30,760
they're like.

1710
02:29:30,760 --> 02:29:35,400
And it shocks them. And I agree with you, God bless you, brother. I gotta jump, we got

1711
02:29:35,400 --> 02:29:38,000
more calls coming up, but you're right. No, I mean, that's a lot of people say that it's

1712
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:42,160
like an intervention. It was shocking. A lot of people didn't like it, because they are

1713
02:29:42,160 --> 02:29:47,720
in trances. Folks, you need to get angry. That's the beginning, like Howard Beale says

1714
02:29:47,720 --> 02:29:54,880
in network. First you've got to get mad. We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex

1715
02:29:54,880 --> 02:30:01,960
Jones and the GCN radio network.

1716
02:30:01,960 --> 02:30:05,940
Millions of people are going to get sick this winter from colds, flu and other illnesses.

1717
02:30:05,940 --> 02:30:10,720
Don't be one of them. Protect yourself with Supernatural Silver, a revolutionary new broad

1718
02:30:10,720 --> 02:30:15,880
spectrum antibacterial solution. Recent advances in silver technology have resulted in a silver

1719
02:30:15,880 --> 02:30:20,720
solution that can be used daily to prevent bacteria, viruses, mold and food poisoning

1720
02:30:20,720 --> 02:30:25,600
and help improve wound healing. Supernatural Silver is safe enough to consume every day

1721
02:30:25,600 --> 02:30:30,640
while powerful enough to destroy the causes of many serious diseases such as stress, death,

1722
02:30:30,640 --> 02:30:35,920
pneumonia, colds, flus and other harmful pathogens. This new technology has the ability to terminate

1723
02:30:35,920 --> 02:30:40,760
entire colonies of harmful bacteria at several hundred times the effectiveness of colloidal

Tyranny is here. The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.

1739
02:32:10,800 --> 02:32:13,200
It really says that the state is God.

1740
02:32:13,200 --> 02:32:17,720
The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most impressive police states

1741
02:32:17,720 --> 02:32:23,320
on earth. This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps

1742
02:32:23,320 --> 02:32:28,760
now being expanded nationwide. This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program

1743
02:32:28,760 --> 02:32:33,520
has established an all powerful shadow state. Police state four chronicles the sickening

depth to which our republic has fallen. Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency

1745
02:32:38,840 --> 02:32:44,800
dictatorship, body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on

1746
02:32:44,800 --> 02:32:49,520
every street corner. It's only the beginning of the new world order's hellish plan. The

1747

police state isn't coming. It's here. Secure your copy today at InfoWars.com or see it

1749
02:33:01,880 --> 02:33:07,920
I don't have to tell you things are bad. Everybody knows things are bad. It's a depression. Everybody's

1750
02:33:07,920 --> 02:33:14,240
out of work or scared of losing their job. The dollar buys a nickel's worth. Banks are

1751
02:33:14,240 --> 02:33:19,040
going bust. Shopkeepers keep a gun under the counter. Punks are running wild in the street

1752
02:33:19,040 --> 02:33:24,120
and there's nobody anywhere who seems to know what to do and there's no end to it. We know

1753
02:33:24,120 --> 02:33:29,840
the air is unfit to breathe. Our food is unfit to eat. We sit watching our TVs while some

1754
02:33:29,840 --> 02:33:35,400
local newscaster tells us that today we had 15 homicides and 63 violent crimes as if that's

1755
02:33:35,400 --> 02:33:40,520
the way it's supposed to be. We know things are bad, worse than bad. They're crazy. It's

1756
02:33:40,520 --> 02:33:44,320
like everything everywhere is going crazy so we don't go out anymore. We sit in the

1757
02:33:44,320 --> 02:33:48,480
house and slowly the world we're living in is getting smaller and all we say is please

1758
02:33:48,480 --> 02:33:53,340
at least leave us alone in our living rooms. Let me have my toaster and my TV and my steel

1759
02:33:53,340 --> 02:33:57,200
belt and radios and I won't say anything. Just leave us alone. Well I'm not going to

1760
02:33:57,200 --> 02:34:02,560
leave you alone. I want you to get mad. I don't want you to protest. I don't want you

1761
02:34:02,560 --> 02:34:05,400
to riot. I don't want you to write to your congressmen because I wouldn't know what to

1762
02:34:05,400 --> 02:34:08,920
tell you to write. I don't know what to do about the depression and the inflation and

1763
02:34:08,920 --> 02:34:13,080
the Russians and the crime in the street. All I know is that first you've got to get

1764
02:34:13,080 --> 02:34:22,360
mad. You've got to say I'm a human being. My life has value. I want you to get up now.

1765
02:34:22,360 --> 02:34:28,040
I want all of you to get up out of your chairs. I want you to get up right now and go to the

1766
02:34:28,040 --> 02:34:35,200
window, open it and stick your head out and yell I'm as bad as hell and I'm not going

1767
02:34:35,200 --> 02:34:42,160
to take this anymore. I want you to get up right now. Get up, go to your windows, open

1768
02:34:42,160 --> 02:34:49,680
them and stick your head out and yell. I'm as bad as hell and I'm not going to take this

1769
02:34:49,680 --> 02:34:55,920
anymore. That's right. I'm your host, Alex Jones. We'll get to your calls. I want you

1770
02:34:55,920 --> 02:35:00,720
to do this prompt article. We have some more clips that I want to play right now, but that's

1771
02:35:00,720 --> 02:35:04,780
why they're so scared and that's why they're trying to say, oh, that's a losing tactic

1772
02:35:04,780 --> 02:35:08,320
to get angry because I'm not here to make you love me.

1773
02:35:08,320 --> 02:35:15,540
I'm here to get you to realize you're being usurped. I mean, they are cold bloodedly hammering

1774
02:35:15,540 --> 02:35:22,940
these dead kids deaths to get our guns to enslave us. They're going to come and take

1775
02:35:22,940 --> 02:35:26,760
our guns. They're going to raise our taxes again and again. They're going to reduce us

1776
02:35:26,760 --> 02:35:30,920
to absolute despotism. They're going to eat out our substance, the power to tax and the

1777
02:35:30,920 --> 02:35:32,040
power to destroy.

1778
02:35:32,040 --> 02:35:36,400
I'm angry about that. I don't want to have to flee the United States. There's nowhere

1779
02:35:36,400 --> 02:35:43,300
to run. I know who these people are. And we're never going to get out of this if we don't

1780
02:35:43,300 --> 02:35:47,320
get angry about it. And all of you that have decided to serve the system, I mean, come

1781
02:35:47,320 --> 02:35:55,840
on. You think you've picked the winning side and oh, so what, we're going to have tyranny.

1782
02:35:55,840 --> 02:36:01,160
You're idiots. Do you know what real evil is? Because you've signed on to it.

1783
02:36:01,160 --> 02:36:05,040
And I think if you really knew what's going on and what's at the head of this thing, you

1784
02:36:05,040 --> 02:36:10,640
would not want to be under its wings. I mean, I'll tell you right now. And I know a lot

1785
02:36:10,640 --> 02:36:14,680
of you are dumbered in dirt out there that support the system or you're childlike and

1786
02:36:14,680 --> 02:36:20,040
you like to have fantasy that Obama's your friend and the government's your friend. No,

1787
02:36:20,040 --> 02:36:27,200
it's not. The only reason this tyranny hadn't taken over quicker is there's good people

1788
02:36:27,200 --> 02:36:29,200
outside and inside the system.

1789
02:36:29,200 --> 02:36:35,080
Let me read to you this Pravda article or at least part of it because I saw this yesterday,

1790
02:36:35,080 --> 02:36:38,000
didn't have time to read it, read it this morning and it just blew me away. Because

1791
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:41,640
I know everything in this article in the first five or six paragraphs is absolutely true

1792
02:36:41,640 --> 02:36:49,560
and documented. These days, this is written by Stanislav Mission, who by the way, boys,

1793
02:36:49,560 --> 02:36:54,580
you want bonuses, get me Stanislav on with an interpreter, whatever it takes.

1794
02:36:54,580 --> 02:36:58,640
Might speak English, a lot of Russians do. These days, there are few things to admire

1795
02:36:58,640 --> 02:37:05,960
about the socialist, bankrupt and culturally degenerating USA. But at least so far, one

1796
02:37:05,960 --> 02:37:10,040
thing remains, the right to keep and bear arms and use deadly force to defend oneself

1797
02:37:10,040 --> 02:37:11,040
and possessions.

1798
02:37:11,040 --> 02:37:15,160
Yeah, it's the only beachhead of liberty really left right now. And people are clinging to

1799
02:37:15,160 --> 02:37:18,900
it and it's actually growing the movement and awakening. And they hate the statistics

1800
02:37:18,900 --> 02:37:22,940
that areas that have guns have lower crime rates. They hate that. If they don't kill

1801
02:37:22,940 --> 02:37:27,360
our gun movement, it's over, okay? I don't need their supercomputers to look into the

1802
02:37:27,360 --> 02:37:31,520
future. I can historically, culturally, and with the brain God gave me, look for it.

1803
02:37:31,520 --> 02:37:37,360
And of course, they even say now what I've said, that they've got a nippus in the bud.

1804
02:37:37,360 --> 02:37:41,960
You don't get, you've already lost globalist. This is not gonna be like Russia. This will

1805
02:37:41,960 --> 02:37:49,160
not be like China. This will not be like other areas. By the way, the Russians did give one

1806
02:37:49,160 --> 02:37:54,800
hell of a fight. And if you don't know the history of that, the White Russians, nothing

1807
02:37:54,800 --> 02:37:58,640
new with white people, folks. They were all white. Some of them are Asian on the East

1808
02:37:58,640 --> 02:37:59,640
side.

1809
02:37:59,640 --> 02:38:04,280
The point is, they were the pro-Zarists. And you can say what you wanted about the Zars.

1810
02:38:04,280 --> 02:38:08,800
It was medieval, and it was a dictatorship of royalty. But people had private property

1811
02:38:08,800 --> 02:38:12,880
and the poorest people could feed themselves, and they could have guns, and they were treated

1812
02:38:12,880 --> 02:38:19,200
with respect. They starved to death, more than 50 million of them shot, killed, worked

1813
02:38:19,200 --> 02:38:24,920
them to death in just the first few decades, and they killed another 15 million after that.

1814
02:38:24,920 --> 02:38:28,640
And if you look at the globalist takeover model, as this article points out, it's designed

1815
02:38:28,640 --> 02:38:34,440
just off this Stalinist, Leninist takeover. See, that's what I tried to say earlier, folks.

1816
02:38:34,440 --> 02:38:38,280
If this was just good old boy corruption, I wouldn't be risking my life to fight them.

1817
02:38:38,280 --> 02:38:42,120
I'd just be saying it's wrong and exposing it. And I'm here desperately trying to get

1818
02:38:42,120 --> 02:38:47,800
you to realize that even if they wipe me out, God forbid, or bad things come in the future.

1819
02:38:47,800 --> 02:38:52,000
Listen, knowing this information could stop them down the road from really bad stuff.

1820
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:55,000
They wanna cut all the food and water off, that's what they're setting up. They wanna

1821
02:38:55,000 --> 02:39:00,920
kill millions of us. And I mean, I've got the FBI's own testimony where they were in

1822
02:39:00,920 --> 02:39:04,520
there with Obama's handlers. And they were in there saying, we're gonna put 50 million

1823
02:39:04,520 --> 02:39:07,320
in forced labor camps, we're gonna kill 25 million of them.

1824
02:39:07,320 --> 02:39:11,560
I mean, this is their plan, now they've set those up. They'll collapse things and advertise

1825
02:39:11,560 --> 02:39:17,280
it as good though, you have to understand. And there's all these sickos and wannabe sadists

1826
02:39:17,280 --> 02:39:23,560
who wanna run these things. And I mean, I'm sorry, I am not gonna go in there, okay? You're

1827
02:39:23,560 --> 02:39:34,000
gonna have to pay for it. And America knows you're coming. They didn't sell 10 million

1828
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:37,640
guns last month, and now it's gonna be on track even more this month cuz people don't

1829
02:39:37,640 --> 02:39:38,640
know.

1830
02:39:38,640 --> 02:39:44,520
They know who you are, their gut knows who that you are. I'm gonna shut up, let me get

1831
02:39:44,520 --> 02:39:50,260
back to this. These days, there are a few things to admire about the socialist bankrupt

1832
02:39:50,260 --> 02:39:55,560
and culturally degenerating USA. But at least so far, one thing remains, the right to bear

1833
02:39:55,560 --> 02:40:01,160
arms and use deadly force to defend oneself and possessions.

1834
02:40:01,160 --> 02:40:07,880
This probably comes as a total shock to most of my Western readers. But at one point, Russia

1835
02:40:07,880 --> 02:40:12,260
was one of the most heavily armed societies on Earth. This was, of course, when we were

1836
02:40:12,260 --> 02:40:17,900
free under the czar. Weapons from swords to spears and pistols and rifles and shotguns

1837
02:40:17,900 --> 02:40:18,900
were everywhere.

1838
02:40:18,900 --> 02:40:23,100
Yeah, in fact, you weren't a man unless you carried a pistol. Common items, people carried

1839
02:40:23,100 --> 02:40:27,260
them concealed, they carried them holstered. Fighting knives were the prominent part of

1840
02:40:27,260 --> 02:40:34,380
many traditional attires and those little tubes, Chris's, crossing on the costumes of

1841
02:40:34,380 --> 02:40:43,060
Cossacks in various caucus and peoples. Well, those bullets were for rifles, that's why

1842
02:40:43,060 --> 02:40:44,060
it's part of their dress.

1843
02:40:44,060 --> 02:40:50,000
You always see them with the bullets on them. Various armies such as the Poles during the

1844
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:55,920
times of troubles, or Napoleon, or the Germans, even as the czar estate collapsed on the way

1845
02:40:55,920 --> 02:41:01,480
to World War I and Wall Street money. Found that holding Russian lands was much, much

1846
02:41:01,480 --> 02:41:08,220
harder than taking them. And that it was no easy walk in the park, but a bloodbath on

1847
02:41:08,220 --> 02:41:09,220
its own.

1848
02:41:09,220 --> 02:41:12,860
That's right, that's why when the West tried to collapse Russia at the end of World War

1849
02:41:12,860 --> 02:41:16,460
I, they couldn't do it cuz they had guns. And Napoleon couldn't do it, he'd beaten everybody,

1850
02:41:16,460 --> 02:41:21,820
but he couldn't beat the Russians, because their citizens would sit there and snipe you.

1851
02:41:21,820 --> 02:41:28,680
So Western banks on record declassified congressional hearings in the 70s, sent 25 million in gold

1852
02:41:28,680 --> 02:41:36,120
in with more than 10,000 New Yorkers trained with rifles with Lenin to take over. And they

1853
02:41:36,120 --> 02:41:41,420
took over Moscow, and then our media said, Uncle Lenin has taken over, he's a great man.

1854
02:41:41,420 --> 02:41:47,980
And then they went in and just killed everybody. Because it was the government, they got the

1855
02:41:47,980 --> 02:41:50,460
central government under control, it wasn't an open outsider.

1856
02:41:50,460 --> 02:41:55,420
See, if you can't realize that, you can't beat these people. Various armies such as

1857
02:41:55,420 --> 02:42:00,000
the Poles during the times of trouble, or Napoleon, or the Germans, even as the czar

1858
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:06,140
estate collapsed with the weight of World War I, and Wall Street money. Found that holding

1859
02:42:06,140 --> 02:42:10,780
Russian lands was much harder, let me see a document cam shot of this, I'm gonna show

1860
02:42:10,780 --> 02:42:12,400
folks this article.

1861
02:42:12,400 --> 02:42:19,700
Was much harder than taking them, and taking was no easy walk in the park, but a bloodbath

1862
02:42:19,700 --> 02:42:28,700
all its own. In holding one faced an extremely well armed and aggressive population hell

1863
02:42:28,700 --> 02:42:35,780
bent on exterminating or driving out the aggressor. This well armed population was what allowed

1864
02:42:35,780 --> 02:42:42,100
the various white factions to rise up, no matter how disorganized politically or militarily

1865
02:42:42,100 --> 02:42:43,900
they were in 1918.

1866
02:42:43,900 --> 02:42:47,940
And waged a savage civil war against the reds that went on for more than 15 years off and

1867
02:42:47,940 --> 02:42:53,380
on. And that's why finally when Stalin had wiped them all out, then he killed 50 million

1868
02:42:53,380 --> 02:42:59,300
people. Once he'd gotten full control, it took him decades to kill everybody. And they've

1869
02:42:59,300 --> 02:43:01,140
got the same plan under agenda 21.

1870
02:43:01,140 --> 02:43:05,660
That's why you can't have a garden in your front yard or backyard. This is all a Russian

1871
02:43:05,660 --> 02:43:12,700
takeover because it was a banker takeover. American money did that to the Russians. It

1872
02:43:12,700 --> 02:43:17,300
should be noted that many of these armies were armed peasants, villagers, farmers and

1873
02:43:17,300 --> 02:43:24,300
merchants protecting their own. It had not been for Washington's clandestine support

1874
02:43:24,300 --> 02:43:28,060
of the reds, history would have gone quite differently.

1875
02:43:28,060 --> 02:43:32,820
Just like our government funded just now in 49, that's not declassified. He killed over

1876
02:43:32,820 --> 02:43:37,860
80 million people, depending on which number you look at, 60 to 80. Moscow fell, for example,

1877
02:43:37,860 --> 02:43:44,780
not from lack of weapons to defend it, but from lying guile the reds. 10,000 reds took

1878
02:43:44,780 --> 02:43:52,180
Moscow and were opposed only by some few hundred officer cadets and their instructors.

1879
02:43:52,180 --> 02:43:56,580
Even then the battle was fierce and losses high. However, in the city alone at the time

1880
02:43:56,580 --> 02:44:03,860
lived 30,000 military officers, both active and retired, all with their own issued weapons

1881
02:44:03,860 --> 02:44:07,620
and ammunition. Plus tens of thousands of other citizens were armed. The Soviets promised

1882
02:44:07,620 --> 02:44:11,660
to leave them all alone if they did not intervene.

1883
02:44:11,660 --> 02:44:16,920
They did not and for what we were asked afterwards to come register themselves and their weapons

1884
02:44:16,920 --> 02:44:23,340
where they were promptly shot. And the Russians go on to explain to them they are murdering

1885
02:44:23,340 --> 02:44:27,060
liars, they are about to do to you what it does. That's right, you study the Russian

1886
02:44:27,060 --> 02:44:32,780
Revolution and then you look at the Trotskyites who finally Stalin double crossed the Lenin

1887
02:44:32,780 --> 02:44:36,020
Trotskyites and sent them over here to Mexico and the US.

1888
02:44:36,020 --> 02:44:41,900
They took over and became the neo cons. Go look it up, the founder of it, Crystal's dad

1889
02:44:41,900 --> 02:44:49,420
was a top commie general. And they said, okay, we got kicked out over here, we're gonna come

1890
02:44:49,420 --> 02:44:55,580
over here, we're in so much trouble. They're gonna follow an exact Soviet blueprint. And

1891
02:44:55,580 --> 02:44:57,140
it really is just hard to deal with.

1892
02:44:57,140 --> 02:45:02,540
I understand why a lot of you can't believe this is happening because it's so horrible.

1893
02:45:02,540 --> 02:45:08,320
Folks, they wanna break us forever. Okay, the Russians were just as armed as the Americans.

1894
02:45:08,320 --> 02:45:15,700
They beat Napoleon and they beat the Reds at first until our government sent a bunch

1895
02:45:15,700 --> 02:45:20,300
of armed US citizens over there that knew how to shoot.

1896
02:45:20,300 --> 02:45:24,420
Army veterans and people, it's just so evil. As you know, American citizens helped take

1897
02:45:24,420 --> 02:45:29,340
Moscow. And see, as soon as McCarthy, it's now been declassified by the Russian file,

1898
02:45:29,340 --> 02:45:34,260
said, our army runs the Soviets. My gosh, he was destroyed but in one day. When he was

1899
02:45:34,260 --> 02:45:37,900
being used to just persecute liberals and people and set up a police state, see, they

1900
02:45:37,900 --> 02:45:42,500
used the threat they created to take our rights over here as well.

1901
02:45:42,500 --> 02:45:47,160
Just like in episode three, the emperor becomes the emperor by staging attacks against his

1902
02:45:47,160 --> 02:45:52,840
own bases. See, that's a child's movie, explain to you how false flag works. Now, the globalists

1903
02:45:52,840 --> 02:45:57,600
this time are gonna use Muslim extremists as the pretext to have the cover of the takeover.

1904
02:45:57,600 --> 02:46:02,220
But then the real manuals, which are now public, are all about gun owners. The whole thing

1905
02:46:02,220 --> 02:46:06,700
is about checkpoints, grid points, locking down the food, coming and getting our guns.

1906
02:46:06,700 --> 02:46:11,440
I mean, they plan it. And they're gonna call him Lincoln, they're not gonna call him Lenin.

1907
02:46:11,440 --> 02:46:15,620
Obama will be, you better remember the day you heard all this, cuz if we don't beat him

1908
02:46:15,620 --> 02:46:21,060
politically, this is what's gonna happen. They're gonna call this Lenin-esque takeover

1909
02:46:21,060 --> 02:46:26,180
Obama, he's their man. They plan on making him a full dictator, there's no doubt now.

1910
02:46:26,180 --> 02:46:31,820
They plan on making him the new Lenin, that'll be what he's called privately. They're gonna

1911
02:46:31,820 --> 02:46:35,940
call him Abraham Lincoln. And I knew this was coming because of the build up and all

1912
02:46:35,940 --> 02:46:41,160
the other points whenever they were advertising him as the new Lincoln and all these movies

1913
02:46:41,160 --> 02:46:42,160
and TV shows.

1914
02:46:42,160 --> 02:46:45,600
And I said, they're going to say that he's gonna crush the states and the right wingers.

1915
02:46:45,600 --> 02:46:50,020
And now that's in daily costs and others, they go, you bet he's Lincoln, we're coming

1916
02:46:50,020 --> 02:46:54,020
for your guns, get ready. And they're talking about federal militias that are gonna round

1917
02:46:54,020 --> 02:46:59,200
us up. You see, they want our guns cuz they fantasize like Piers Morgan agreed. He said,

1918
02:46:59,200 --> 02:47:02,400
I'm gonna get in a uniform and I'm gonna blow Alex Jones' brains out.

1919
02:47:02,400 --> 02:47:08,280
And the media is like, you bet, kill Alex Jones. But there was nobody outside harassing

1920
02:47:08,280 --> 02:47:13,000
me, no, no, no. They just said they wanna kill me on TV and talked about my kids, hope

1921
02:47:13,000 --> 02:47:21,440
they don't get killed. And I'm not even, listen, I'm not worried about myself or even my family

1922
02:47:21,440 --> 02:47:25,120
cuz they have no future if we don't beat them.

1923
02:47:25,120 --> 02:47:28,920
My flesh says just leave the country. I've warned you, I've done my part, I've been on

1924
02:47:28,920 --> 02:47:32,240
the front line, bye, I'm out of here, I'll broadcast from Switzerland or some other place.

1925
02:47:32,240 --> 02:47:36,760
Not that they're perfect, but get out of here. I'm not doing that, I'm staying, I'm going

1926
02:47:36,760 --> 02:47:41,320
all the way up against these people and I pray that God reprieve us.

1927
02:47:41,320 --> 02:47:45,080
But you know what, the White Russians weren't aborting 50 plus million babies. The Russians

1928
02:47:45,080 --> 02:47:49,640
were pretty moral people, folks, about as moral as you could get, culturally. They went

1929
02:47:49,640 --> 02:47:54,640
to church like 15 hours on Sundays and two hours a night every other night of the week

1930
02:47:54,640 --> 02:47:55,640
and everything else.

1931
02:47:55,640 --> 02:48:00,000
I mean, hard working people. And they were turned over by our filthy government and foreign

1932
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:07,800
banks to be murdered and butchered. And now they wanna do that here to us. And it's just

1933
02:48:07,800 --> 02:48:15,360
so horrible. It's so horrible, they're gonna do this. They're gonna call us terrorists

1934
02:48:15,360 --> 02:48:17,660
and they're gonna set up a Soviet takeover of America.

1935
02:48:17,660 --> 02:48:21,160
The Red Terror is gonna come to America. That's what Homeland Security is, is the Red Terror

1936
02:48:21,160 --> 02:48:25,680
force. Mike and Mash here on the air, go ahead.

1937
02:48:25,680 --> 02:48:32,720
Yeah, Alex, I got an article for you to pull up titled Linsky, L-I-N-S-K-Y, Linsky taking

1938
02:48:32,720 --> 02:48:38,120
new slant on gun control. Here in Massachusetts, a state rep, David Paul Linsky, he wants to

1939
02:48:38,120 --> 02:48:43,240
introduce legislation that calls for liability insurance for gun owners, storage of assault

1940
02:48:43,240 --> 02:48:46,000
weapons at only gun clubs, can't have them in your home.

1941
02:48:46,000 --> 02:48:49,080
No, no, that's the plan. It's British style. That's what the commission's gonna say. Biden's

1942
02:48:49,080 --> 02:48:53,680
already saying it. Everyone must re-register, quote, as a new background check. You can't

1943
02:48:53,680 --> 02:48:58,280
give your son a gun. Any guns given to you by anybody else will be retroactively illegal

1944
02:48:58,280 --> 02:49:01,400
and they're gonna make you go get, quote, insurance on them. Yes, that's the plan.

1945
02:49:01,400 --> 02:49:06,800
Yeah, and you know what? I just got off the phone with the staffer for the state rep and

1946
02:49:06,800 --> 02:49:11,760
she confirmed it's not, the bill isn't written up yet, but they're working it out. But she

1947
02:49:11,760 --> 02:49:16,280
confirmed that they want insurance. They want storage of assault weapons in gun clubs and

1948
02:49:16,280 --> 02:49:20,200
they want full mental disclosure that you have to sign a waiver before you apply for

1949
02:49:20,200 --> 02:49:24,640
your license so that the issuing officer can get any mental health screening.

1950
02:49:24,640 --> 02:49:29,520
And that just reminds me of Brandon Robb. It's a total gun purge, you know?

1951
02:49:29,520 --> 02:49:33,600
No, listen, they're coming. What did I say two months ago? Drums, drums in the deep,

1952
02:49:33,600 --> 02:49:37,120
they are coming. I mean, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. I can hear the drums. I can see

1953
02:49:37,120 --> 02:49:44,040
all the signs. Now they're at the door. We're now here, okay? And they're not just gonna

1954
02:49:44,040 --> 02:49:45,040
shoot up schools.

1955
02:49:45,040 --> 02:49:48,880
They're gonna blow stuff up and blame it on us. I mean, folks, this is it. And listen,

1956
02:49:48,880 --> 02:49:51,760
a lot of you are just gonna go along with it, listen to Glenn Beck and sit there and

1957
02:49:51,760 --> 02:49:56,040
they're just gonna talk, be nice and not say the government's bad. They're going to take

1958
02:49:56,040 --> 02:50:04,400
everything. This is a Soviet 1970 takeover. I've studied their battle plan. It is a Soviet

1959
02:50:04,400 --> 02:50:09,960
takeover. The Rothschild Rockefeller banks wrote the Russian takeover plan.

1960
02:50:09,960 --> 02:50:14,280
This is their plan refined. Look at the plan in Libya. Look at the plan in Syria. Look

1961
02:50:14,280 --> 02:50:18,280
at the plan in Iraq. They're doing it here. They went to all, I'm sorry, go ahead, sir.

1962
02:50:18,280 --> 02:50:22,280
Yeah, if you wouldn't mind, I'd like to give out the phone number for people to call in

1963
02:50:22,280 --> 02:50:23,280
on this guy.

1964
02:50:23,280 --> 02:50:27,080
Well, listen, listen, I believe in your voice sounds good, but I've always got to check

1965
02:50:27,080 --> 02:50:29,600
numbers before we give them out on air. People can call in with the wrong number to some

1966
02:50:29,600 --> 02:50:33,240
old lady and then we're in deep trouble. Email me the number, we'll look at doing that. We're

1967
02:50:33,240 --> 02:50:37,840
trying. And again, by the end of the show, I've got this chest cold or whatever it is.

1968
02:50:37,840 --> 02:50:42,880
So it's hard for me not to have packing attacks. I'm not as eloquent as I normally am. The

1969
02:50:42,880 --> 02:50:49,320
Russians and the previously Russian run government run Pravda is saying, do not turn your guns

1970
02:50:49,320 --> 02:50:50,320
in.

1971
02:50:50,320 --> 02:50:53,640
They're planning a red tear that your own banks financed. We've seen this before. Don't

1972
02:50:53,640 --> 02:50:56,260
turn them in. And by the way, they're going to tell the police and military to turn their

1973
02:50:56,260 --> 02:51:00,400
guns in. That's in the 7277 State Department plan. After our guns are taken, yours are

1974
02:51:00,400 --> 02:51:01,400
taken.

1975
02:51:01,400 --> 02:51:06,000
Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid

1976
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:11,160
seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that in a real meltdown,

1977
02:51:11,160 --> 02:51:14,800
non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold? It's true, seeds have

1978
02:51:14,800 --> 02:51:18,160
outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could

1979
02:51:18,160 --> 02:51:22,720
even happen again. So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect

1980
02:51:22,720 --> 02:51:29,140
mix of non-hybrid seeds. They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply

1981
02:51:29,140 --> 02:51:33,480
of nutrient dense food for you and your family. And here's the best part. These seeds have

1982
02:51:33,480 --> 02:51:37,600
not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant

1983
02:51:37,600 --> 02:51:44,960
a full acre crisis garden. So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com

1984
02:51:44,960 --> 02:51:56,000
or give them a call at 877-327-0365. That's 877-327-0365. Remember, in a real crisis,

1985
02:51:56,000 --> 02:52:00,800
non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item. This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.

President could obtain this world-class healer. Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are

System from Tarragonics.com. Tarragonics, life's getting better.

2008
02:54:11,700 --> 02:54:15,240
By the way, you know what? You just heard me break down. I need to do more eloquently

2009
02:54:15,240 --> 02:54:20,440
in some special reports, but you've heard me say this many times. It's the Soviet style

2010
02:54:20,440 --> 02:54:29,540
1917 Red Terror takeover. And sure, the Soviet Union didn't come till later. You know, technically

2011
02:54:29,540 --> 02:54:36,020
it's just a Red's takeover. Red Terror would be the proper term. And again, you're saying,

2012
02:54:36,020 --> 02:54:40,660
well, are they communists? What are they? It's mega banks. It's the same very banks

2013
02:54:40,660 --> 02:54:45,440
that did this, that always wanted to take down Russia because it wasn't controlled by

2014
02:54:45,440 --> 02:54:50,500
their system. And then Russia kind of got away from them for a while under Stalin. He

2015
02:54:50,500 --> 02:54:56,780
double-crossed them. And then Gorbachev was a globalist agent. And then now they're trying

2016
02:54:56,780 --> 02:55:01,540
to merge the EU with Russia. It's just a horrible situation all around. Let's take some more

2017
02:55:01,540 --> 02:55:07,260
calls. I appreciate you holding. Let's talk to a Heretic from Washington and

2018
02:55:07,260 --> 02:55:14,980
then we'll go to Chris and others. We'll do some overdrive. Go ahead, Heretic. Okay, he's

2019
02:55:14,980 --> 02:55:17,980
gone. Let's talk to Chris in Oklahoma. You're on the air. Go ahead.

2020
02:55:17,980 --> 02:55:20,980
Hey, Alex. How's it going? Good, buddy.

2021
02:55:20,980 --> 02:55:25,820
I just wanted to call in and give people kind of a mindset into somebody who is actually

2022
02:55:25,820 --> 02:55:30,620
a conflict schedule weapons. I was with the 45th Infantry Brigade and Delta Company, first

2023
02:55:30,620 --> 02:55:35,660
the 279 during Hurricane Katrina. We were really the first boots on the ground. And

2024
02:55:35,660 --> 02:55:42,220
keep in mind, we were an infantry brigade and we were called there for security. Saving

2025
02:55:42,220 --> 02:55:47,460
lives would have been nice or whatever, but that's just not what we do. And when we come

2026
02:55:47,460 --> 02:55:52,540
up to your house, it's just a hell of a scene. It's just like something out of a movie. It's

2027
02:55:52,540 --> 02:55:58,260
five trucks. Everyone departs. They stack right on the outside of the frame of the door

2028
02:55:58,260 --> 02:56:03,060
and then they come through. Well, every now and then we would knock and yell, does anyone

2029
02:56:03,060 --> 02:56:06,060
need any assistance? But that's how I'm booting in the door.

2030
02:56:06,060 --> 02:56:10,840
Well, that's the psych warfare thing. We're here to assist you. I mean, that's all. This

2031
02:56:10,840 --> 02:56:15,940
is not an attack. And this happened on record. Again, this is the training. This is the test.

2032
02:56:15,940 --> 02:56:18,940
I think you called a few years ago and told the whole story, didn't you?

2033
02:56:18,940 --> 02:56:23,940
Yeah, it was a couple of months ago. I called in and I was talking to Rob, the health ranger

2034
02:56:23,940 --> 02:56:27,140
it was. Okay, so finish your story. I mean, describe

2035
02:56:27,140 --> 02:56:31,260
to people, yeah. And then ABC News said if someone resisted, you killed them.

2036
02:56:31,260 --> 02:56:38,180
Yes, sir. What happened, I was called up in the middle of the night and literally at 2

2037
02:56:38,180 --> 02:56:42,500
a.m. I reported to the unit at 4 a.m. We were told immediately that there's news reports

2038
02:56:42,500 --> 02:56:47,980
and reports on the ground that people are firing at rescue helicopters. The city is

2039
02:56:47,980 --> 02:56:52,900
descended into total chaos and we're gonna come in there and put our boot up some butt.

2040
02:56:52,900 --> 02:56:55,460
Yeah, exactly. Notice the cover story with you at society.

2041
02:56:55,460 --> 02:57:00,460
Now we're gonna go find and shoot in helicopters later made up. We're just gonna go take everybody's

2042
02:57:00,460 --> 02:57:04,220
guns at their houses. Yeah, we're going to secure the city at any

2043
02:57:04,220 --> 02:57:10,180
and all costs. We'll meet aggression with aggression. And that's how it was to be done.

2044
02:57:10,180 --> 02:57:13,660
And we're like this, right wing terrorists just nuked the major city. All of them are

2045
02:57:13,660 --> 02:57:17,220
to be killed on sight. They don't turn the guns in. We're gonna round up the troll makers

2046
02:57:17,220 --> 02:57:22,740
as well. You're the willows and you're dead. Hail Obama, King of Earth. Sorry, go ahead.

2047
02:57:22,740 --> 02:57:27,380
Oh, sorry. They used that whole situation. I figured this out later. I'm not in the military

2048
02:57:27,380 --> 02:57:31,700
anymore. And this plagues me every day that I went around and actually did this. It didn't

2049
02:57:31,700 --> 02:57:35,420
occur to me till later what I was what I was doing. I know it sounds like an ignorant cop

2050
02:57:35,420 --> 02:57:39,140
out, but no, no, no, no, no. You just walk up and suddenly you're being

2051
02:57:39,140 --> 02:57:43,180
groped by TSA. You just walk up one day and they say, take your shoes off. You walk up

2052
02:57:43,180 --> 02:57:46,300
one day and they say, go get in the ditch and they shoot you in the back of the head.

2053
02:57:46,300 --> 02:57:50,660
But I mean, look, they are planning this and then they're going to call gun owners terrorist.

2054
02:57:50,660 --> 02:57:55,260
And then I hope people understand they plan a red style takeover. If people submit to

2055
02:57:55,260 --> 02:57:58,660
this, it's over. If you could imagine what this, you know,

2056
02:57:58,660 --> 02:58:03,500
the geoengineering and things that go on, whatever you could say about Katrina, it happened.

2057
02:58:03,500 --> 02:58:08,700
And it's just that emergency situation where everybody's hyped up. You know, my whole unit

2058
02:58:08,700 --> 02:58:13,900
is is on fire to do this mission. And me as a young soldier who had had some disciplinary

2059
02:58:13,900 --> 02:58:18,020
problems, I'm eager to prove myself. You know what I mean? I'm eager to show that I'm combat

2060
02:58:18,020 --> 02:58:23,060
ready and I'm ready to go. You know, I just did it. I didn't. I wasn't there to exactly.

2061
02:58:23,060 --> 02:58:26,820
I mean, I think we should all just turn our guns into Obama and have one hundred percent

2062
02:58:26,820 --> 02:58:30,980
tax and all live in forced collectives like Mao did. And I think 80 million of us should

2063
02:58:30,980 --> 02:58:35,940
be killed by Mao. And I think Mao is God there. Now I can be on Piers Morgan and I can be

2064
02:58:35,940 --> 02:58:40,940
popular. We have a guy claiming he was a Piers Morgan audience member. Stay with us.

Coming back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive from natural disasters

2067
02:58:56,820 --> 02:59:01,380
like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on

2068
02:59:01,380 --> 02:59:06,340
by a disastrous economy? Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything. At E Foods

wrote, Almost all the grocery stores are closed, but I managed to get my foods just in time

2072
02:59:20,780 --> 02:59:25,500
to be able to help my sister and niece. It is better to be prepared ten years too early

2079
03:00:15,300 --> 03:00:23,660
Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones. All right,

2080
03:00:23,660 --> 03:00:29,900
folks, we're now into overdrive here. We've got a fellow who says he was a previous audience

2081
03:00:29,900 --> 03:00:34,140
member. They didn't have a studio audience when I was there, but they do sometimes. Derek

2082
03:00:34,140 --> 03:00:40,340
in New Jersey. That was a scary last phone call. Then we got James. We'll try to cram

2083
03:00:40,340 --> 03:00:46,420
in. But real fast, Derek, what's your story? Hey, Alex, how you doing? Good. Hey, I was

2084
03:00:46,420 --> 03:00:52,740
an audience member back in September when Jesse Ventura was the guest. I was actually

2085
03:00:52,740 --> 03:00:56,100
one of the audience members. I got to ask him a question. That was the first audience

2086
03:00:56,100 --> 03:01:05,300
member. Getting a little nervous. My experience on that show was that they filled the audience.

2087
03:01:05,300 --> 03:01:08,580
You can't really see it from the angles that they shot it at, but they filled the audience

2088
03:01:08,580 --> 03:01:13,140
with people, interns, people from other floors. They were pulling people out of the street.

2089
03:01:13,140 --> 03:01:19,340
They couldn't fill the entire audience, all the seats. There were a bunch of empty seats.

2090
03:01:19,340 --> 03:01:24,280
The guy next to me who asked the second question about the Navy seal book, they pulled him

2091
03:01:24,280 --> 03:01:28,740
off the street. I swear this happened. They pulled him off the street because we were

2092
03:01:28,740 --> 03:01:33,180
talking to my brother and I. My brother even pointed it out to one of the producer people

2093
03:01:33,180 --> 03:01:36,100
who comes over. He said, oh, you're pulling people off the street. She gave him a snide

2094
03:01:36,100 --> 03:01:41,780
remark and the guy, they said, here's your question. They handed him the car. They said,

2095
03:01:41,780 --> 03:01:44,380
they went through it. They practiced it. I was right next to the guy and they said, here

2096
03:01:44,380 --> 03:01:46,980
you go. Here's what you're going to ask him. And he asked him the question. They didn't

2097
03:01:46,980 --> 03:01:51,740
even get to the other audience members that were picked to ask questions.

2098
03:01:51,740 --> 03:01:57,020
Sir, they had people on a rooftop in Atlanta with a green screen saying they were under

2099
03:01:57,020 --> 03:02:01,900
nerve gas attack. I mean, have you, no, I mean it's CIA and they're not even, did you

2100
03:02:01,900 --> 03:02:06,580
notice that how, how the place looks shabby and was rotting. It was disgusting. I actually

2101
03:02:06,580 --> 03:02:12,300
used that bathroom. It was, I couldn't believe it. Wow. So you, you, you saw the poop on

2102
03:02:12,300 --> 03:02:16,500
the walls. It was terrible. They, they, yeah, before, before the show went, they said, if

2103
03:02:16,500 --> 03:02:20,020
anyone needs to use the bathroom, come with us. My brother went to, it was, I couldn't

2104
03:02:20,020 --> 03:02:23,820
believe it. You sound credible. We can go to the last Ventura interview and see if it

2105
03:02:23,820 --> 03:02:29,100
matches your voice and people will do that later when this goes online.

2106
03:02:29,100 --> 03:02:32,740
Describe the layout of the Piers Morgan set. When you come in out of the hallway, how was

2107
03:02:32,740 --> 03:02:33,740
it laid out?

2108
03:02:33,740 --> 03:02:38,020
Well, the way he had it set up there was kind of like a round table. So everyone was sitting

2109
03:02:38,020 --> 03:02:40,980
in the middle. Before you go in the studio, what's, what's right outside the door. They

2110
03:02:40,980 --> 03:02:41,980
brought you in.

2111
03:02:41,980 --> 03:02:47,900
Yeah, it was like a cruddy white walls or the ceiling was caved in. It was terrible

2112
03:02:47,900 --> 03:02:52,180
lighting. There was, I mean, it looked like you were in a, I mean, it looked like they

2113
03:02:52,180 --> 03:02:57,420
bring the trash through there every day, but what was the layout? What was the layout of

2114
03:02:57,420 --> 03:03:02,780
the, of the green room? And then the, what was beside it?

2115
03:03:02,780 --> 03:03:07,220
Well, we just, I just went to the restroom. It was through the, through the doors and

2116
03:03:07,220 --> 03:03:09,340
I didn't quite go past through the green rooms.

2117
03:03:09,340 --> 03:03:12,140
It was white walls. By the way, that's not the common restroom. I'm talking about the

2118
03:03:12,140 --> 03:03:16,140
green room restroom was dirty too. I appreciate your call, sir. Good to hear from you. Let's

2119
03:03:16,140 --> 03:03:20,380
talk to James in Minnesota with vital info and XM listener. Go ahead.

2120
03:03:20,380 --> 03:03:25,900
Hey Alex, this is James. Thank you so much for taking my call. A long time listener.

2121
03:03:25,900 --> 03:03:33,300
First time caller. I just want to say that I do hereby solemnly swear and affirm that

2122
03:03:33,300 --> 03:03:38,260
I am prepared to die for the public. I am prepared to die for Liberty. I'm a us infantry

2123
03:03:38,260 --> 03:03:43,320
army show army soldier. I am prepared to die in the defense of this Republic. And I stand

2124
03:03:43,320 --> 03:03:44,320
on that.

2125
03:03:44,320 --> 03:03:48,940
What do you think about the Russians saying, don't turn in your guns. Like our military

2126
03:03:48,940 --> 03:03:51,980
did, you know, under the state department memorandum after they get our guns, they have

2127
03:03:51,980 --> 03:03:54,780
the general army stand down and turn their guns in.

2128
03:03:54,780 --> 03:04:00,740
Oh, absolutely. I mean, that's, that's what they've done in every, every communist revolution

2129
03:04:00,740 --> 03:04:04,740
is always a purge of the military after they're done being useful idiots after they're done

2130
03:04:04,740 --> 03:04:09,700
using us to enact their agenda, they murder us. And I'm telling you right now, everyone

2131
03:04:09,700 --> 03:04:13,700
listening to this, everyone who can hear my voice right now, you are in the military.

2132
03:04:13,700 --> 03:04:19,220
If you do not stand against this, you will die. They will murder you. You are their enemy.

2133
03:04:19,220 --> 03:04:25,420
They hate you. Now look, I have, I have a message of tragedy and hope. I, I have seen

2134
03:04:25,420 --> 03:04:28,980
the enemy and I have looked into his eyes and I know who he is, but I know how to defeat

2135
03:04:28,980 --> 03:04:29,980
him.

2136
03:04:29,980 --> 03:04:35,740
And I'm going to share that with you right now. Are you prepared? All right. Last night

2137
03:04:35,740 --> 03:04:43,180
I spoke with tier one special operations officer. He looked me square in the eyes. We're going

2138
03:04:43,180 --> 03:04:47,060
into extra overdrive. This is too important. We'll go to more calls as well. Don't hang

2139
03:04:47,060 --> 03:04:53,260
up. Don't hang up. James folks, I've studied history. I know this attack pattern. That's

2140
03:04:53,260 --> 03:04:57,540
why I keep telling you what's coming next. I guess I just got chills. This is a red Soviet

2141
03:04:57,540 --> 03:05:15,220
style takeover by mega banks, not the Russians.

2142
03:05:15,220 --> 03:05:27,980
Joe Biden is, is leading the fight against the technocrats, but we can't do that without

2143
03:05:27,980 --> 03:05:28,980
your help. By getting the films, bumper stickers, and t-shirts and info wars.com. It will wake

2144
03:05:28,980 --> 03:05:33,320
up people in your area and support our operation. As we move to the next level, we need your

2145
03:05:33,320 --> 03:05:38,900
help to spread the word. Like never before, they wish to hide themselves during this tectonic

today from his central texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues

2169
03:08:09,780 --> 03:08:15,620
it's alex jones and the gcn radio network so they announced yesterday they were going to use

2170
03:08:15,620 --> 03:08:20,260
executive orders to ban semi-autos other things and because it was a huge backlash they came out

2171
03:08:20,260 --> 03:08:26,820
today i saw on msnbc and cnn both globalist channels collaborator channels saying nobody's

2172
03:08:26,820 --> 03:08:32,100
going to take your guns through executive orders the executive order only activates interpretations

2173
03:08:32,100 --> 03:08:38,500
of existing laws so the new thing is yes a dictator would use executive orders to take guns

2174
03:08:39,060 --> 03:08:44,740
our executive orders only interpret laws that already exist that's what we've said they could

2175
03:08:44,740 --> 03:08:49,620
use some street sweeper legislation to expand to all semi-autos and then claim under rulemaking

2176
03:08:49,620 --> 03:08:53,540
you got to turn them in that's what larry pratt said a month ago on the show they can also harass

2177
03:08:53,540 --> 03:08:57,540
with rule making the gun shops and make it impossible and make them you know well under

2178
03:08:57,540 --> 03:09:02,580
atf rules you got to have 50 million in insurance they in fact they said they're going to target

2179
03:09:02,580 --> 03:09:08,100
manufacturers with rules so and again they're just getting you ready where they have the moral

2180
03:09:08,100 --> 03:09:12,500
high ground where every time there's a mass shooting that they advertise and and and hype

2181
03:09:12,500 --> 03:09:19,140
up with copycats that it's your fault you collectively have the guilt you did it like

2182
03:09:19,140 --> 03:09:23,140
you told larry pratt yesterday he said don't you feel anything for what's happened don't you feel

2183
03:09:23,140 --> 03:09:28,820
any empathy like he's done it and i would have said i wouldn't have been so mad of course he

2184
03:09:28,820 --> 03:09:33,540
didn't bring that up to me because i knew he'd say something like that i plan to say you mean

2185
03:09:33,540 --> 03:09:37,380
you're the ones that made them victim disarmament zones and advertise it's the place to go kill

2186
03:09:37,380 --> 03:09:43,060
people i did get that part out you're the ones you're the ones using 20 dead which is terrible

2187
03:09:43,060 --> 03:09:47,940
but statistically very low probability why don't you use all the other horrible stories out there

2188
03:09:47,940 --> 03:09:51,860
because you've got an agenda now i want to shut up go back to your calls james in minnesota says

2189
03:09:51,860 --> 03:09:57,700
he's an army infantryman and he wanted to get into talking to some people last night in the

2190
03:09:57,700 --> 03:10:04,100
military and what he was hearing he's listening on xm james go ahead hey alex thanks for uh going

2191
03:10:04,100 --> 03:10:09,460
back to me hey you better recap what you said recap what you said and then cover it all right

2192
03:10:09,460 --> 03:10:15,460
last night i was uh speaking to a friend of mine this guy is tier one alex this is u.s army special

2193
03:10:15,460 --> 03:10:21,460
operations this guy's been in he's seen it from every angle and i just asked him straight up i

2194
03:10:21,460 --> 03:10:29,140
said hey um if it comes to it are you seriously willing to look me in the eye and kill me and he

2195
03:10:29,140 --> 03:10:34,260
said this to me he saw you right to my face and the face of my wife he said yes i would i would

2196
03:10:34,260 --> 03:10:40,500
come to your house i would kick in your door and i would kill you to take your gun and the moment

2197
03:10:40,500 --> 03:10:47,380
he said that to me the you know god just revealed this to me in a glorious flash light this is how

2198
03:10:47,380 --> 03:10:51,940
we are going to defeat these people alex we're going to call their bluff we're going to turn

2199
03:10:51,940 --> 03:10:58,180
their threats back on them i haven't i had this idea for a campaign we're going to call it we are

2200
03:10:58,180 --> 03:11:03,860
the dead we're going to have a massive facebook campaign we're going to get people who are willing

2201
03:11:03,860 --> 03:11:07,940
to stand with the public with republic we're willing to stand with democracy we're going to

2202
03:11:07,940 --> 03:11:13,300
get them to delete their facebook pages in mass if they want to treat us like unpersons but they

2203
03:11:13,300 --> 03:11:17,780
want to dehumanize us we're going to pull out from their system we're going to reject them

2204
03:11:17,780 --> 03:11:24,260
i want to get a massive advertising campaign going i want t-shirts i want bumper stickers we are the

2205
03:11:24,260 --> 03:11:32,420
dead we are the 1.5 million if one percent resisted 1.5 million who would die if these

2206
03:11:32,420 --> 03:11:38,740
laws are enacted we're going to call their bluff and i want 1.5 million patriots to march on

2207
03:11:38,740 --> 03:11:45,540
washington dc in mass and we're going to stand there in a silent protest and at the stroke of 12

2208
03:11:45,540 --> 03:11:49,620
we're all going to light candles and we're going to blow them out one by one and we're just going

2209
03:11:49,620 --> 03:11:54,820
to stand there well that's powerful you should shoot a youtube video describing your idea no i

2210
03:11:54,820 --> 03:12:00,180
mean that's what i've done on air is i've i've said okay i'm not going along with this and that's

2211
03:12:00,180 --> 03:12:05,540
why i got morgan's face is because i've had to go across that line i'm public they've now made me

2212
03:12:05,540 --> 03:12:09,540
the poster boy to take down when they blow up stuff you better believe they're going to blame me

2213
03:12:10,580 --> 03:12:14,180
and they're going to try to get all the other cowards out there who are libertarians or whatever

2214
03:12:14,180 --> 03:12:19,060
to then come criticize me and and when they do that they're benedict arnolds

2215
03:12:19,060 --> 03:12:23,860
okay our forebears went through this you know don't be so angry at the new world order don't

2216
03:12:23,860 --> 03:12:28,900
get in their face don't you know go along don't don't say you know that's what this is coming down

2217
03:12:28,900 --> 03:12:34,500
to and listen i've had the calls i've talked to a lot of military folks where they said their

2218
03:12:34,500 --> 03:12:38,820
commanders are like yes we will kill americans they don't turn their guns in so now it's gone

2219
03:12:38,820 --> 03:12:44,180
from it'll never happen to we're going to kill the americans i mean it's total treason and oh

2220
03:12:44,180 --> 03:12:48,500
by the way it won't be sob stories for us that are dead and i just want the military and police to

2221
03:12:48,500 --> 03:12:56,740
know once this starts i i mean it they just have no idea and usually militaries throughout history

2222
03:12:56,740 --> 03:13:01,700
usually do this and then they're called out as well i mean i i don't know what it would be like

2223
03:13:01,700 --> 03:13:06,020
if this guy looked at you and said i'll come kill your family i mean he's been psychologically

2224
03:13:06,020 --> 03:13:11,140
profiled and chosen for this so he i mean i guess there's no order he wouldn't follow just anything

2225
03:13:11,140 --> 03:13:16,500
he'll do it and alex this is why we have to call their bluff look i'm telling you man well what

2226
03:13:16,500 --> 03:13:22,580
did you say to him when he said this i i just i just said well you know what if if a faceless

2227
03:13:22,580 --> 03:13:28,580
corporate fascist regime means more to you than the lives of of human beings then the lord bless

2228
03:13:28,580 --> 03:13:32,900
you and keep you that's all i could say to him that's all that's honestly all i could say to him

2229
03:13:32,900 --> 03:13:40,660
because yeah these guys think being evil is manly and and it's the opposite i mean i mean alex look

2230
03:13:40,660 --> 03:13:46,500
i'm telling you we're not the best but we're all that's left i want to work for you man i want to

2231
03:13:46,500 --> 03:13:51,940
come to austin i want to make this a reality i want one point five well well here's the issue

2232
03:13:51,940 --> 03:13:55,620
if you try to have people march on washington they put provocateurs and it would never even

2233
03:13:55,620 --> 03:14:01,780
the point is we need a million marches in every town and city every day with banner hangs and

2234
03:14:01,780 --> 03:14:06,980
people doing youtube videos and other ideas and people saying i'm not turning my guns in this is

2235
03:14:06,980 --> 03:14:11,300
about despotism and you know drudge putting up the fact that hitler wanted the guns and stalin

2236
03:14:11,300 --> 03:14:16,100
one of the guns we need to call them what they are authoritarians using dead kids for their agenda

2237
03:14:16,100 --> 03:14:21,940
i appreciate your call i mean i think most of the military i talk to aren't going to go along with

2238
03:14:21,940 --> 03:14:29,620
this but uh the ones that they're going to put in command are and i've analyzed it it is a vicious

2239
03:14:29,620 --> 03:14:35,220
takeover plan and a lot of people say man you're scary i guess you're just cowards then because

2240
03:14:35,220 --> 03:14:42,420
you know i'm telling you what i really think it is so we can face it and i i i mean my instinct

2241
03:14:42,420 --> 03:14:48,180
my gut my intellect everything points towards resist this get back in its face or it wins

2242
03:14:48,180 --> 03:14:53,940
my fear is letting them take over so i'm running around like a chicken with my head cut off

2243
03:14:55,780 --> 03:15:01,540
trying to warn people and as radical as this show sounds we're getting new affiliates in fact

2244
03:15:01,540 --> 03:15:10,260
here's a couple of them every week khnc 1360 am the lion port collins colorada 10 000 water

2245
03:15:10,260 --> 03:15:17,780
and that's one we're featuring that's been an affiliate uh and wjnl 12 10 am

2246
03:15:19,460 --> 03:15:25,700
traver city michigan 50 000 watts thanks to pd and gm and the great stations and i think those

2247
03:15:25,700 --> 03:15:30,340
are two stations we already had so this is this is a station in focus this is not the new affiliates

2248
03:15:30,340 --> 03:15:34,900
that that list is somewhere else but i need to have the affiliates in focus thing once a week as

2249
03:15:34,900 --> 03:15:40,340
well uh but but it's it's all very very exciting i just came in and said hey here's some new

2250
03:15:40,340 --> 03:15:46,100
affiliates and that's actually the new stations in focus deal um but we have gained several new

2251
03:15:46,100 --> 03:15:51,220
affiliates this week as well the point is the broadcast is steadily steadily growing here

2252
03:15:51,220 --> 03:15:58,900
let's talk to chris in california uh wants to talk he's listening on xm chris what's your take on all

2253
03:15:58,900 --> 03:16:05,860
this and man i think that this is all something that you predicted from the beginning i'm a one

2254
03:16:05,860 --> 03:16:11,300
year listener first time caller and that piece of garbage going back is always preaching about

2255
03:16:11,300 --> 03:16:15,540
doing your homework and doing your research and last night i did my research and went on youtube

2256
03:16:15,540 --> 03:16:22,820
now you've been talking about this since july 25th 2001 i mean you called 9 11 on the spot

2257
03:16:22,820 --> 03:16:27,860
you know you you know we got i i appreciate everything you're doing alex and and uh i'm

2258
03:16:27,860 --> 03:16:32,180
getting my mother my brothers my friends everybody's getting into the show i'm trying to

2259
03:16:32,180 --> 03:16:37,540
get them on info wars this is all you know i'm ready man i never thought anything like this could

2260
03:16:37,540 --> 03:16:42,180
be possible my last time i was hoping it wouldn't but well no i mean it's a foreign banking takeover

2261
03:16:42,180 --> 03:16:46,660
to label all gun owners as terrorists and then and then the gun grabbers is sweet people that love

2262
03:16:46,660 --> 03:16:52,020
children and they're sending men in black uniforms to get our guns it's their excuse to start a civil

2263
03:16:52,020 --> 03:17:00,020
war so they can then like the regs uh take over i mean that's their plan and and listen i i just

2264
03:17:00,020 --> 03:17:04,180
really quick i think that it's going to be quite as simple as i don't think obama knows that he

2265
03:17:04,180 --> 03:17:09,700
can't take our guns yet but this is all a setup and i think what did what python was saying yesterday

2266
03:17:09,700 --> 03:17:13,940
i think the setup is they're just going to make it more difficult for people like you and i

2267
03:17:13,940 --> 03:17:19,300
to take to carry our guns around you know more gun no gun zones and that so when that happens

2268
03:17:19,300 --> 03:17:22,420
that's when they're going to be able to confiscate the guns because all of these

2269
03:17:22,420 --> 03:17:26,740
movies are going to start shooting people and blowing people up and blaming on people like us

2270
03:17:26,740 --> 03:17:31,220
who you know just wanted to they're going to make it more difficult for us to defend ourselves well

2271
03:17:31,220 --> 03:17:37,700
god bless you let's go to eric uh in canada real quick go ahead hey alex first time call i've been

2272
03:17:37,700 --> 03:17:43,700
following you since 2004 and you're awesome um i gotta tell you since all of this stuff has been

2273
03:17:43,700 --> 03:17:48,660
going on and after watching what happened on pierce morgan the other night um me and my wife

2274
03:17:48,660 --> 03:17:52,500
are going out to start buying guns and i don't know if you know what canada is about but we

2275
03:17:52,500 --> 03:17:58,980
we don't have a very big gun population up here but as much as this stuff is going on state side

2276
03:17:58,980 --> 03:18:05,060
this stuff is going on canada side to uh the idol no more movement which is being held by the natives

2277
03:18:05,060 --> 03:18:10,500
so on and so forth you know alex i gotta tell you my friend you know we will stand there we

2278
03:18:10,500 --> 03:18:15,620
will stand in front of you we will not allow these guys to take you down and from your brothers from

2279
03:18:15,620 --> 03:18:22,180
the north i swear to god we're here for you guys well that touches my heart and again i'm certainly

2280
03:18:22,180 --> 03:18:26,420
an imperfect vessel to be right up at the tip of the spear we're all up there together i'm trying

2281
03:18:26,420 --> 03:18:31,620
my best thank you for the support uh they're going to demonize us they're going to use all of this

2282
03:18:31,620 --> 03:18:37,700
