1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:20,720
he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.

3
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:43,920
Ladies and gentlemen, it is Thursday, the third day of the new year, 2013. And we are

4
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,040
going to be here, Lord willing, for the next three hours. We do have Dr. Jerome Corsi joining

5
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:53,440
us. They are going ahead with the North American Union NAPA superhighway program, despite telling

6
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,800
the public that first it didn't exist, and then the legislature shot it down twice.

7
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,160
It affects the entire nation, but begins down in Mexico through Texas up into Canada. They

8
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,920
even have the whole highway planned out with the highway markers for all the way into Canada.

9
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:12,740
But then when you talk about it, they say it doesn't exist. And that's part of the psychological

10
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:21,480
warfare tactic they use in general. The legislation is introduced and is passed out of committee

11
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:28,840
in Illinois to ban all semi-autos, even pump shotguns, pump rifles. I saw a comment on

12
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,840
infowars.com.

13
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,340
They said pump rifles. There's actually a lot of pump rifles. Now, the point is is that

14
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:42,960
it's everything but bolt action. And the NRA, of course, is responding to it. And it looks

15
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:50,340
like it's gonna pass very, very close today. And Obama is quoted as saying he wants to

16
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,660
quickly go for immigration reform, totally open borders, end of America, just not even

17
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,400
having a country.

18
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:03,720
No other country lets you do that. It's globalism, it's New World Order, and gun control. So

19
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:13,080
it's hammer down. And you notice that in mainline, quote, conservative circles, they're not even

20
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,420
discussing this. They're talking about tax increases in the fiscal cliff, which is important,

21
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,880
but the power to tax is the power to destroy.

22
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:24,540
But this pales in significance. And I didn't even get to it yesterday, cuz it's so well

23
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:28,600
known that Obama's one of the greatest liars in history. Just because we've gotten deeper

24
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:33,400
into the corruption, he's just a puppet. But the system is lying through their mouthpiece

25
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,780
where he said, I'll never raise your payroll taxes, I'll never raise this tax, that tax.

26
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:44,600
They're raising payroll taxes, you name it, a whole bunch of new taxes, fines, fees, regulations.

27
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:51,080
One of the crew members calculated on their paycheck what the new payroll tax is that

28
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:57,640
started. And it comes out to about 200, a little over $200 a month. So we're gonna do

29
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:04,460
a news piece on that. Or I guess whoever volunteers around here, we can black out their pay stub

30
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,460
and all that.

31
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:10,440
But government knows when you work for a company, they can just keep adding fees and regulations

32
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:19,880
and surcharges onto things. One of my crew members got pulled over literally two days

33
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:25,080
after his insurance expired, cuz he was gonna sell the truck, cuz he did, he did sell the

34
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:31,280
truck. The illegal aliens, of course, are released, they're allowed to not have insurance.

35
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:38,040
And I think he's gonna do a news piece on it, it's not a secret, but it was a $300 ticket.

36
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,640
It's all automated, turned out the cops had cameras that were scanning and reading it,

37
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:48,040
that's why they pulled him over. And then they said there's gonna be another surcharge

38
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:53,200
whenever you go to get your license of between 300 and $1,000 next time he renews it.

39
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,920
And then he got another $500 charge in the mail and it says you are convicted and they're

40
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,600
just starting to send him more and more bills. That's the new system where you're never out

41
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:10,080
of it. To be a US citizen is to be seen, you've seen those cartoons where the wolf looks at

42
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:16,480
the rabbit or looks at the chicken and then actually sees it as like a skinned piece of

43
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:20,400
meat on a spit and then starts drooling.

44
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:27,980
When government sees you, that's what they see is a meal and they see a mark. Americans

45
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:35,040
are now known as planetary chumps, we are now known as dinner. And all of us more and

46
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,200
more have to do whatever we can to get out of the system, sabotage the system, not go

47
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,120
along with it, because it's totally illegitimate.

48
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:47,400
You guys pull me the article Steve Watson did about checkpoints all over the highways.

49
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,520
By the way, now they're gang checkpoints where they search your vehicle. I mean, this country

50
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:57,760
is in martial law. It's what degree of it and we've got forced inoculation news as well

51
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:01,480
coming up.

52
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:05,960
We have witnessed two terrible storms in the east, but we are still in the eye of the perfect

53
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:10,960
storm. The most devastating economic conditions since the Great Depression, America's worst

54
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:16,200
drought in agricultural history, and now the economic results of the presidential election.

55
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:21,160
This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply. I just doubled down and got even

00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:25,600

Up from the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones. A new world order. What

88
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:39,880
we are looking at is good and evil, right and wrong. A new world order. A new world

89
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:54,240
order. A new world order. A new world order. A new world order. Ladies and gentlemen, we

90
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:05,680
are live. It is Thursday, the third day of January, 2013. And we are going to be here

91
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:12,600
for the next three hours. Wow, where to begin? I have a personal story of here in our office

92
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:24,600
of just unmitigated, over the top oppression and tyranny going on with one of our crew

93
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,720
members who we're gonna keep anonymous at this point.

94
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:37,360
And I'm gonna tell that story calmly at the bottom of the hour. And I will tie it into

95
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,840
everything else that's happening. But you need to understand, ladies and gentlemen,

96
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:46,920
that the globalists are moving on every front. They are not just coming to confiscate the

97
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:56,020
guns. I am so busy working and spending time with my family and things that I never have

98
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,960
time to go out bird hunting or deer hunting.

99
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:03,720
I never even have time to really go to the shooting range, maybe two or three times a

100
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:08,020
year. I have time to go shooting now or I have people visit and they wanna shoot cuz

101
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:11,840
I live out in the country now. So I guess I'm shooting a little bit more than I used

102
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:21,720
to. Growing up, I shot every week and became a pretty good rifleman and even shot competitively

103
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,800
a little bit with rifles and handguns.

104
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:34,160
But that is a side issue rabbit trail. It's not that I'm freaked out about physically

105
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:40,200
Dianne Feinstein now introducing the bill today to confiscate most firearms. It's not

106
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:44,360
even the idea of going and laying them outside and the police come and inspect your house

107
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,360
without warrants.

108
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,780
That's what they're announcing. And they set up checkpoints on highways that are now searching

109
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:53,240
for firearms. That's now happening all over the country. They're even taking legal ones.

110
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,260
They don't care if the law says you could have a gun, they just take it right here in

111
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,260
Texas as well.

112
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:03,920
I mean, it's just martial law being phased in. It's that I know what comes with it and

113
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:10,720
it's going to be taxes increasing on everything. It's going to be VAT, it's going to be increased

114
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:17,720
sales taxes, it's gonna be increased taxes on energy. It is going to be increased payroll

115
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:23,840
taxes, that's already happening, surcharges, and it's designed. Some of the economists

116
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,640
say this will destroy the economy.

117
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:30,680
Well, that's the plan. I mean, they've got 100 plus million people on one form of welfare

118
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:35,320
or another. They wanna go up to 200 million. They've gone from 25 million on food stamps

119
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:41,880
to 49 million in four years. And they intend to double that. And they don't mince words

120
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:47,940
about it. This is your domestication. America has always been the target.

121
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:53,200
And we are to be fully brought down like Poland or Ukraine under Soviet occupation. And I've

122
00:11:53,200 --> 00:12:03,080
studied history in depth, that is the plan. And people could say, cuz I've tried to psychoanalyze

123
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:13,640
myself. Is it a macho action that I am going to stay behind in this country and go toe

124
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,640
to toe with this?

125
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:18,920
And no, that is not why I'm doing it. It's not out of some hatred of the New World Order

126
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:26,760
and what they do. It's out of an absolute duty and commitment and pledge to fight these

127
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:31,760
people. I just wanna get it across to you, ladies and gentlemen, that they're hurting

128
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,520
innocents all over the world.

129
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:43,040
And they're doing things that when you're even mildly informed, are so over the top

130
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:52,960
that it boggles the mind. They give premature babies vaccines now in this country and kill

131
00:12:52,960 --> 00:13:00,760
them. They know full well what they do. They give pregnant women vaccines and push them

132
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:06,200
and tell them in hospitals it's the law when they come in to get checkups, when there is

133
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,200
no law.

134
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:19,880
Guys, I sent you probably 50 IMs and it's clear there's a problem, you need to reload

135
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:25,760
that. Because I had the definitions in the history of gaslighting, it's a political term.

136
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:30,760
So if that's not in there, I need you to go get me just the top four or five up, the use

137
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:34,920
of gaslighting, the psychological term gaslighting, cuz I wanna cover gaslighting.

138
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:42,280
It's just one term to cover a game the globalists play, and they define it as gaslighting. And

139
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:49,880
it's when you walk in and you find your wife in bed with another man. And she says, there's

140
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:54,360
no man here and the guy gets up, dresses and walks out. They've psychologically found most

141
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,140
people will actually go, am I crazy?

142
00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:01,080
That's not a guy right there. And because of denial, how we've been programmed through

143
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:12,280
television, gaslighting is more and more effective today than it's ever been. So I'm gonna go

144
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:21,240
over gaslighting today, because I read that term years ago, but I came back across it.

145
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:26,520
And I'm like, that's a great term for what I've been trying to describe. So many times

146
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:30,380
you learn something and you forget it, and they've got different terms for it. They've

147
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:37,160
got Stockholm syndrome, I mean, there's a lot of different learned helplessness.

148
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:44,600
But they've been building the Napa superhighway from Mexico into Texas and up in Oklahoma.

149
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:48,880
It's all over the news here. And they go on CNN over the years, I've played the clips

150
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:53,880
and go, Ron Paul isn't sane. There is no trans Texas corridor, Napa superhighway. When it's

151
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:59,680
all department transportation and publicly admitted and billboards up everywhere, then

152
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,680
they go, it doesn't exist.

153
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:05,040
And then they say, we're not gonna build it now. And then they sign an order and bring

154
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,320
it back in, even though the legislature said no, cuz they're having the states go and pay

155
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:14,840
for it with taxpayer money. And then the globalists get the tax money off the toll roads. Or it's

156
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:23,560
like CBS, NBC, ABC, all of them saying, Wayne LaPierre is a liar, there are no guns in Israel,

157
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:27,560
there are no armed teachers, there are no armed citizens, that is a lie.

158
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:32,160
The answer to mass shootings is not arming people. And the media went, whoa, LaPierre

159
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:39,760
has got egg on his face, man, that guy's a liar. I mean, it's an absolute fact in triplicate

160
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:43,080
that since the 80s, they've armed the teachers. And then when they go on field trips, they've

161
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:50,080
got M16s, and it's in Haaretz, Jerusalem Post, anybody can go type, Israeli teachers

162
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,200
armed, Israeli citizens armed.

163
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:57,400
It's a known fact, you can go read the Israeli laws on the Knesset website, and we've done

164
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:03,120
newscast on it showing you. But see, we can't reach but a few million people a day. And

165
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:08,160
even those listening on radio, once they've been gas lit, once they've been manipulated,

166
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,740
once everything's been fogged, they're like, well, he says they got guns, but I've never

167
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,280
been there.

168
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:23,080
And it's just incredible. Yeah, there's Fox News showing the teachers with the armed teachers

169
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:29,280
guards bolster school security in Israel. That's from December 30th. As bad as Fox News

170
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,520
is, at least they didn't try to hoax their audience. That's why they got more audiences

171
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:36,580
than all the cable news channels combined, because they at least tell enough of the truth

172
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:42,200
so people don't think they're total operatives and actually watch them.

173
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:46,400
That's part of the hoax, though, with MSNBC and CNN, whose top shows have a half million

174
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:52,120
viewers a piece. I mean, there's big shows in Chicago and Dallas and New York that per

175
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:57,120
hour have over a half million listeners on one radio station. I mean, I can look at the

176
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,800
numbers on affiliates we've got. Some of our bigger affiliates, we have 110,000 listeners

177
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:06,220
an hour.

178
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:15,360
And that's right off the dash, instant meter computers, 100% people are listening. But

179
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:20,320
it doesn't matter, they get up there in these big giant glistening sets, and they tell you

180
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:25,840
authoritatively, you need to turn your guns in. And people just, well, my gosh, I mean,

181
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:30,740
Piers Morgan, he has that snot-nosed accent and he's such a big audience.

182
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:34,880
Even around here, when I told my crew that they've officially set me up for the seventh

183
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,360
with Piers Morgan, people are incredible. And of course, they're thinking it'll be a

184
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,960
big news event because we'll have an argument or something. And that is how Piers Morgan

185
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,820
actually does have an audience. His actual show doesn't have an audience. The derivative

186
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:49,560
of it does get picked up and put on a lot of other channels.

187
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:54,320
That's why he's number one on CNN, is that he at least knows to have enough controversy

188
00:17:54,320 --> 00:18:00,680
and people he disagrees with on to try to get some viewers. So I mean, it's a good move

189
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:05,780
by the Pentagon that on record runs CNN. That's come out Washington Post even, that it's run

190
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:09,920
by the Department of Defense and is basically a PSYOP operation out of Atlanta, New York

191
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,400
and Los Angeles and DC.

192
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:21,520
Well, not just a PSYOP, it's far beyond that. But still, there's the, my gosh, Piers Morgan,

193
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:26,200
you're gonna be on there? I mean, it's almost not worth it to go down to the satellite uplink

194
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:31,160
and do the interview. Seriously, and I'm not just saying that. Well, I turn down every

195
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:35,780
week offers, don't even call people back, I should, some other might be something good

196
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:36,780
comes along.

197
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:42,960
Reality TV shows, Discovery Channel, History Channel, BBC, and they send emails back going,

198
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,240
we're a huge show. Now, I did wanna go on BBC Radio last week, but I was out that day

199
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:52,200
and missed it. Because it was that World Service show that's on everywhere and it's live, that

200
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,560
I would have done. But I don't like tape stuff cuz they can manipulate it.

201
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:01,480
The point is, I'm not up here bragging, hey, I don't need them. It's that they are a hoax.

202
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:07,360
But in a way, I probably should go participate just because the general lemmings see it and

203
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:14,640
think, man, you've really arrived. I mean, my goodness, you were on The View. And The

204
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:20,600
View actually, I did get a big response out of, I've been on Fox, CNN, MSNBC, Discovery

205
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:28,560
Channel, History Channel, you name it, I've been on it, A&E, 60 Minutes, Extra Hard Copy,

206
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:33,240
you name it, I've been on it in 17 years.

207
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:38,480
And it just doesn't do anything, because you've got a bunch of zombies watching it. Now, when

208
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,760
we come back, but again, doesn't matter, it still creates the illusion that they're in

209
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:47,360
charge and that everybody believes them. So you've gotta understand, folks, it's a total

210
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,360
facade.

211
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:53,080
You ever seen those Hollywood facades to a tour of the studios where it looks like a

212
00:19:53,080 --> 00:20:01,800
house but it's just the front with boards propping it up behind it? It's a facade.

213
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:06,200
We have witnessed two terrible storms in the east, but we are still in the eye of the perfect

214
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:11,160
storm. The most devastating economic conditions since the Great Depression, America's worst

215
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:16,240
drought in agricultural history, and now the economic results of the presidential election.

216
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:21,140
This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply. I just doubled down and got even

Here's USA Today, Huffington Post, Bloomberg, Wall Street Journal. We can punch it up for

256
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:23,960
TV viewers that are watching on prisonplanet.tv or just type in tax increase on 77% and literally

257
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:30,640
dozens of articles will pop up. 77% of Americans to have their taxes increased and it'll just

258
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:37,220
be added on to your paycheck or taken out if you actually file your own taxes.

259
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:41,680
And we've got this clip of Obama here. That's just on payroll taxes right there. There's

260
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:47,440
a bunch of other taxes and the Obama surcharge on investments and 401Ks and that's just the

261
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:54,000
beginning. All totals like 14, 15 new taxes, but they call them surcharges and fees so

262
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,480
they're not. It's not global government that's being set up, it's global governance. Let's

263
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:04,320
go ahead and play Obama four years ago back during the campaign as saying, I pledge to

264
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,680
never raise your taxes. Here it is.

265
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:15,960
I can make a firm pledge under my plan. No family making less than $250,000 a year will

266
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:22,600
see any form of tax increase. Not your income tax, not your payroll tax, not your capital

267
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:27,200
gains taxes, not any of your taxes.

268
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:34,880
Okay, so capital gains went up in Obamacare and payroll taxes went up. I mean, he broke

269
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:41,220
every single pledge and that's all he does. And a lot of Obama people over the first three

270
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:44,680
years really woke up to him, his approval rating went down. But once it was the left

271
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:50,520
versus right, rah, rah, Obama, Romney, you're a racist if you don't like Obama, the yuppies

272
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:55,220
and trendies, everybody said, well, hey, Obama's gonna win.

273
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:58,960
And then when Obama won, which was fraud, it was fraud to begin with, the whole fix

274
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,400
was in. Just like with the Republicans and the tax increases right now, it was rigged

275
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:08,440
from who was in the race to the fact that Obama clearly didn't win. They didn't care,

276
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:14,960
he was the guy who could create the most division, so they put him in.

277
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:21,440
And people are like, hey, my guy won, just you're angry about it. And I'm like, do you

278
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:26,920
understand Paul Ryan and Mitt Romney work for the very same foreign banks? And literally

279
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:31,640
when Mitt Romney was governor, he supported abortion, of government abortion funding,

280
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:37,880
open borders, takings, all semi-auto, handguns and rifles, carbon taxes.

281
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:43,760
And they go, sure, you lost, I won. And it's like, listen, this is dangerous, okay? They're

282
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:50,120
gonna destroy the economy. Right, right, you're just a racist. And it used to be a white person

283
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:55,720
calling in or on the street telling me this or commenting or newscasters. And see they

284
00:26:55,720 --> 00:27:02,080
play along like they're part of the power structure, they're winning.

285
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:06,920
And now all over the country, in fact, guys, will you guys print me the article? I had

286
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:11,000
it on the nightly news last night, but I think it's on the other side. You can either jog

287
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:18,200
over there and then try to find it or just print me, teachers fired for not taking vaccines.

288
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:24,840
And there's another one, nurses fired. Suddenly all over the country, there's no law, and

289
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:29,160
they'd actually lost lawsuits before and it's racketeering when they make you do this.

290
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:32,840
But they just count on ignorance and they don't care if they lose lawsuits cuz it's

291
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:38,040
all government funded. It's about medical tyranny and forcing you to take shots. And

292
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:43,760
they're training police under the state's Model Health Emergency Powers Act to forcibly

293
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,960
inoculate you.

294
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,960
And that's what TSA putting their hands on you about, and that's what highway checkpoints

295
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:53,240
are all about, is they're getting you ready to put their hands on you. And I'm gonna get

296
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:58,320
into Feinstein's bill to physically confiscate your guns being introduced today. We told

297
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,880
you yesterday, Illinois was gonna introduce a bill, according to the NRA, they've done

298
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,880
it.

299
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:08,400
It's out of committee, set to pass today. Looks like it may pass right now to make all

300
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:14,360
people in Illinois turn their semi-autos in and pump everything that bolt action is gonna

301
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:18,880
be turned in. And they've got your void card, they know where to come get your gun, so they're

302
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:23,960
coming. It'll be on the news, the trucks and the police and people resisting being killed.

303
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:29,160
And it'll be patriotism to kill American gun owners, and they deserve it. They did Sandy

304
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:32,680
Hook and they're all Klan members anyways. Remember when that month ago they were calling

305
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,800
us Klan members and murderers?

306
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:38,280
You're like, that makes no sense, why are they just saying that? Cuz they're demonizing

307
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:45,640
us. Okay, see, you never saw demonization like that before, did you? See, they're taking

308
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:51,880
all the safeties off politically. They're announcing all of it. Here it is, nurses fired

309
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:58,560
for refusing flu shot all over the country. And now they're telling people that have children,

310
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:09,720
you're not gonna get your kid if you don't take the shot to my crew, to my crew.

311
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:13,000
Now we're recording them and stuff and not letting them know that it's my guy and they're

312
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:19,680
just to document all this nightmare, to get them. But the point is, is that I'm gonna,

313
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:24,940
it's just this country, folks. I've got mainstream news announcing checkpoints nationwide at

314
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:30,820
permanent highway checkpoints. Like you've had 100 miles into the border, nationwide

315
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:35,000
you're gonna drive up to police checkpoints, they're gonna search you, TSA is gonna be

316
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
there, it's been announced.

317
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:42,880
I've got those articles here. It's martial law, folks. And they're gonna set up machine

318
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:47,400
gun nest. You're gonna be under machine gun point when you pull up to these. We're going

319
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,760
under Fallujah control.

320
00:29:49,760 --> 00:30:02,320
Here on the march, the empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

330
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:06,240
We have witnessed two terrible storms in the east, but we are still in the eye of the perfect

331
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,800
storm. The most devastating economic condition since the Great Depression. America's worst

332
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:16,000
drought in agricultural history. And now the economic results of the presidential election.

333
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,960
This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply. I just doubled down and got even

more supplies from E Foods Direct and I recommend you do the same. It's time to get your own

Alex. Alex Jones here with a very important announcement for truth seekers. We've carried

342
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:09,120
a lot of amazing films and books over the years on the online video bookstore at Infowars.com.

343
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:14,640
And out of all the titles we've carried, one stands out because it is just so chillingly

344
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:21,420
convincing and that's Dreams from My Real Father by Joel Gilbert, available at Infowars.com.

345
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:25,600
This film exposes the fraud that Obama is like nothing I've seen. If you want to know

346
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:30,900
who Obama's real daddy is, this is the film for you. Don't forget, your purchase supports

347
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:36,200
our broadcast and our growing media network. You'll also find it at Infowarshop.com. None

348
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:40,640
dare call a conspiracy by Gary Allen, the book that woke me up. We're also carrying

349
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:46,720
Behind the Green Mask UN Agenda 21 by Rosa Corey. This book is coffin nails to the globalist

350
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:52,120
takeover. The Greater Good, the most professional and up-to-date film I've ever seen exposing

351
00:32:52,120 --> 00:33:02,120
the scourge that is vaccines. These titles and a lot more are all available at Infowarshop.com.

352
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:11,680
The Alex Jones Show. Some people say a man is made out of mud. A poor man's made out

353
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:18,560
of muscle and blood. Muscle and blood and skin and bones. A mind that's weak and a back

354
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:26,400
that's strong. You load 16 tons, what do you get? Another day older and deeper in depth.

355
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:34,320
St. Peter, don't you call me cause I can't go. I owe my soul to the company store. Monday

356
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:46,120
through Friday, from 12 noon to 3 p.m. Central, we're live back Sundays 4 to 6 p.m. And of

357
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:50,440
course don't forget ladies and gentlemen that we also have Infowars Nightly News 7 o'clock

358
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:54,480
Central every single evening.

359
00:33:54,480 --> 00:34:03,560
Every single evening at 7 o'clock Central and one membership to Infowarsnews.com helps

360
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:08,880
us pay for the bandwidth and expand the TV and filmmaking operations. And one membership

361
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:14,480
then gets an additional 10 people. So really it's a total of 11, the banners on Infowars.com

362
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:20,120
and prisonplanet.com. They say that it is get one membership and share it with 10 people.

363
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:28,360
That's technically 11 memberships. The same username and passcodes can be logged in simultaneously

364
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:36,000
from 11 different computers with the same username and passcode. That is less than 59

365
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,160
cents per person per month.

366
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:43,480
You've absolutely got to go get a prisonplanet.tv membership or buy five or six of them and

367
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:49,300
support us. And then put the username and passcode you create that's for the site. Simple

368
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:54,560
names so people can remember it and go give them maybe cards to your boss or your employees

369
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,720
or your church.

370
00:34:55,720 --> 00:35:02,920
I mean, you could go get three memberships that would be like, I guess $17, $18 a month.

371
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:11,840
And that would be 30 plus memberships. And then go out and get friends and family to

372
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:18,020
tune in every night. We put archives up in high def, all the films, ebooks, a bunch of

373
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:19,020
other documentaries.

374
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:23,320
We've been authorized to post up there. I mean, it really is a first class site now,

375
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:30,780
the new film, strategic relocation, special documentaries, all of it. This is the future

376
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:39,680
of the real medium. This is the real cutting edge. And we are continuing, I mean in perpetuity

377
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:45,060
that you can go get a monthly membership for 595 and 11 people can use it simultaneously.

378
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:50,480
And I'll tell you, most people aren't gonna tune in at the same time at seven o'clock

379
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,720
every night when the show goes on and then re-airs over and over again.

380
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:59,360
So I mean, you can probably get 20, 30 people. I mean, in fact, I think it's safe to give

381
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:04,120
like 20 people your username and passcode. Again, don't have the same username and passcode

382
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:09,240
as we say on the site. You have for other things, make it a unique one. And then email

383
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,240
it to friends and family.

384
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:13,660
Say, hey, here's my username and passcode. You can use it. They just go enter into the

385
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:22,520
username and passcode. Boom, they're in prisonplanet.tv or in fullwarsnews.com. We'll get them there.

386
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:27,440
And this is a really powerful initiative. If you've already got a membership, share

387
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:33,060
it with other people. If you wanna really support us, go get a couple more memberships

388
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:37,800
and print them up on cards, the username and passcode you create that's simple.

389
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:44,700
And then go give it to people, prisonplanet.tv. And I see that people are using this, people

390
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:53,840
are doing this and it is very, very exciting to see tons of people tuning in when the transmission

391
00:36:53,840 --> 00:37:02,840
premieres every single evening at seven o'clock central standard time. And then of course,

392
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:08,680
there's archives a few hours later in HD. You can watch it when you want, how you want,

393
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:09,680
where you want.

394
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:13,260
And we're just adding more and more features to it all the time, a big redesign of the

395
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:20,520
site. Okay, getting back into the news, let me just cover some of what's coming up here.

396
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:25,040
Obama to quickly go for immigration reform, that means total open borders. And this is

397
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:35,360
out of the weekly standard, and gun control. So every time we do the document cam, it's

398
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:40,560
just right here. This is the spot right here, it's right here, we can show the TV viewers,

399
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,080
there you go, it's right there.

400
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:49,580
Obama to quickly go for immigration reform and gun control, White House pledges action

401
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:59,560
this month. And it just continues to go over all of that draconian Illinois gun ban advances

402
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:09,760
to Senate floor. Effort to apply Chicago's disastrous gun policy across entire state

403
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,760
accelerates.

404
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:15,280
It hasn't been disastrous, it's been a mafia takeover, it's worked absolutely well, the

405
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:21,260
drug war is a big success. Record prison populations, the country converting to a prison culture,

406
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:31,240
largest prison population in world history. Giant mega banks laundering all the drug money,

407
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:40,360
the police totally corrupted in many areas, I mean, it's absolutely worked like a charm.

408
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:47,800
And continuing here with the news, deputy police chief calls for permanent DWI checkpoint

409
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:54,460
in Texas. And they're doing this all over the country, they have these individuals under

410
00:38:54,460 --> 00:39:01,360
federal grants. Every day I tune into local radio news and they're going, I think it's

411
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:06,400
the right thing to do to have checkpoints on the highways and just search everyone.

412
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,920
And Clinton called for this and signed an executive order, but obviously was unconstitutional

413
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,960
so it never got implemented. And they said, we're gonna set up hardened checkpoints on

414
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:16,440
the highways and we're gonna pull everybody over and search them. So to get everybody

415
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:21,440
ready up to 100 miles inside the border, they put these up to basically harass citizens

416
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:25,600
and dig through your car without a warrant claiming their constitution free zones.

417
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:29,920
More than half the population lives within 100 miles of a border or coastline. I think

418
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:35,940
it's like 70 plus percent if you pull up the numbers. So the point here is that they're

419
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:43,040
already doing it though. And under Clinton, I filmed this and have it in my film, Police

420
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:51,280
Day 2000. You can see I-35 at night backed up 20 miles from Kyle in South Austin, in

421
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:59,120
the suburbs, all the way to Georgetown, 20 miles traffic, 3 miles an hour, just to see

422
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,440
if they could do it.

423
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:05,680
And people sat there, and if you exited anywhere on the 20 miles, they said that was probable

424
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:11,800
cause to pull you over and search your vehicle on top of it. I mean you see 20 miles of traffic,

425
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:16,280
and we went and drove down the country roads, got out to the end of the checkpoint. Awesome

426
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:20,680
police remember this, and they tried and then the legislature said that's illegal, don't

427
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,680
do it anymore.

428
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:26,960
And the police now servile minions of the feds, at least the police chiefs. You've heard

429
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:33,920
it in Arkansas and Oklahoma and California and Michigan, Marines help run DWI checkpoints.

430
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:40,640
And it's in the newspapers in California and places and Marines with nine millimeter Berettas

431
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:46,720
on their hip and heavy machine guns in the backs of Humvees aiming at people.

432
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:52,920
There's a bank robbery outside Denver, so they shut down 50 something square miles and

433
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:59,840
dozens of roads and streets and have cops out with M-16s aiming them at everybody. Just

434
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:04,080
an act of domination, an act of piracy, an act of total control.

435
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:09,140
And now all over the country, they're pulling people over with the same glove. It's totally

436
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:12,640
illegal to search you without a warrant. They don't care, they just say women, get up against

437
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:19,880
the car. And then they take their hand and go in your body. They go in men's rectum,

438
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:24,340
they go in women's hind end, they go in the women's sexual organ.

439
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:29,580
And the women get sick and they get infections, they do it to multiple people. And they go

440
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:34,640
to the doctor and they just go shut up, shut up and get used to it. We'll use the same

441
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:41,720
glove and we're gonna stick our hands in you and you're gonna take it.

442
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:46,400
Just amazing, ladies and gentlemen. And so here's the article, deputy police chief, he's

443
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:52,000
been doing this like every day for six months, calls for permanent DWI checkpoints in Texas,

444
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,400
hardened points. And this is what Homeland Security is already announcing, they bought

445
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:59,720
thousands of these armored pillboxes that are like these armored 18-wheeler trailers.

446
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:03,120
And they just set them up, they've already done tests in Tennessee and other areas. We've

447
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:08,600
shown you newscast video, showing some of it now, and they just search you.

448
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:12,280
And by the way, folks, it's getting to the point, they're hiring cops, where you even

449
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:17,560
lip them. They just get you out and just go taser time, or they just roundhouse with a

450
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:22,400
big old punch, break your jaw, charge you with assaulting them, even though it's on

451
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:26,240
video. You videotape them, they club your head in, take you to jail, and it's just they're

452
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,600
gonna stomp your guts out, America.

453
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:33,640
They're gonna take your guns unless you wake up. I mean, I'm laying out what's really going

454
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:40,320
on here. I'm telling you where the end of the road goes, okay? I'm telling you where

455
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:47,160
the end of the road goes, okay? And the state police for two weeks, when they showed these

456
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:55,520
police just randomly, I'm gonna pull you over, happened to Darren McBreen's girlfriend.

457
00:42:55,520 --> 00:43:00,000
She's driving all the way out of West Texas to come here and see him. She's on the same

458
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,720
road, cops pull him over, and they go, I saw you not use a turn signal. And she said, I've

459
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:10,320
been on the same lane for over 100 miles, he goes, let me just see your eyes.

460
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:16,120
This is just a DWI, just apologize, just randomly checking here. It's a joke, I mean, cops pull

461
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:21,040
me over, know who I am and ask if I'm drinking or if I have drugs or guns. And I just go,

462
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:25,100
number one, I don't use products that your bosses ship in. Number two, I'm not dumb enough

463
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:26,620
to be drinking and driving.

464
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:40,240
And number three, I just don't even know what to say anymore. You know full well that you're

465
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:46,120
implying guns are illegal. It's gone, it's gone. We have the biggest prison population,

466
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:50,160
we have the highest cancer rate, they're killing us. We're being killed, okay? And I've got

467
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:54,680
all their White House science, our book, Eco Science, where they talk about how they kill

468
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:57,680
us with cancer and kill us with stuff in the water.

469
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:05,360
I mean, it just sterilizes our sperm counts down 87 to 89% and the women are dying. Highest

470
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:08,920
rate of breast cancer in the world and our kids are the most brain damaged in the world

471
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:15,160
from all the shots. And I'm a bad guy, I'm a mad dog for being upset about it. Let me

472
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:21,820
continue here. A deputy police chief in South Texas, South Texas is the second biggest city

473
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:22,820
in Texas.

474
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:26,200
What is it, like 5 million people, wants to set up permanent DWI checkpoints in order

475
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:32,080
to save lives. Well, I mean, how do I put cameras in our house? They're already proposing

476
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:35,960
that in Houston. It saves lives, raising the possibility that Texans would be forced to

477
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:40,160
show their papers, submit to breathalyzer tests, and even mandated to have blood drawn

478
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:42,160
whenever they drive down the street.

479
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:46,720
Yeah, the feds started this 15 years ago in Phoenix, and now they've done it everywhere.

480
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:53,500
And first they go, well, it's a holiday, no refusal to take blood. Listen, one of my graphics

481
00:44:53,500 --> 00:45:06,560
crew was out, and I happen to know she doesn't even drink. And they're out before New Year's,

482
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:10,840
it was after Christmas, and they're driving home and she's a designated driver going out

483
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:12,400
to eat.

484
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:17,720
And they get them out and they go, we're arresting you all, we can smell alcohol. And they go,

485
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:21,720
well, I haven't been drinking, I'm a designated driver. They said, well, do a bunch of sobriety

486
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:25,080
tests. She did one and said, look, I've not been drinking, I told you. They said, that's

487
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:30,860
it, you're DWI too. They wanna stick needles in you, and I'm gonna get to the forced inoculations

488
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:31,860
in a moment.

489
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:37,500
And it goes on, San Antonio Deputy Police Chief Antonio Trevino appeared Monday in Austin

490
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:43,240
before the Texas House Criminal Jurisprudence Committee. The San Antonio Express News reports

491
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:48,600
he urged legislators to allow law officers to stop drivers and do routine sobriety tests

492
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:51,880
near so-called drinking and driving hot spots, which is just everywhere.

493
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:55,880
Again, they let you go drinking the bars, humans have always done it. Texting and driving

494
00:45:55,880 --> 00:46:01,600
is five times more dangerous than MIT studies, that isn't what matters. It's all about getting

495
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:06,600
you into the system, but if you're an illegal alien, they let you go. He says local data

496
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:09,880
could be used to identify areas where such behavior is prevalent.

497
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:15,520
Okay, let me explain to you, they're already doing these illegally. Here's the next story,

498
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:22,800
Steve Watson, infowars.com, prisonplanet.com. Texas cops cite gangs as justification for

499
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:28,880
unconstitutional checkpoints. They set up highway checkpoints across South Texas, and

500
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:33,360
then just search your car, they admit it in the articles, the McKellen Monitor, and make

501
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:39,040
you take your shirt off on the side of the road and take photos of your tattoos.

502
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:44,980
And then the argument is, well, it's the Mexican drug gangs that are government trained and

503
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:49,880
ship guns to and launders the drug money for, well, COVID Wells Fargo on record. I mean,

504
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:54,480
it's all a joke. You made the drugs illegal, just like they made alcohol illegal, cuz you're

505
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:57,640
criminals, cuz you want a cut of it, and you've destroyed Mexico.

506
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:01,920
And now they're gonna declare martial law. I had a state senator on two years ago who

507
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:05,040
said they've already declared martial law on the border. Now it's coming all the way

508
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:11,360
up to San Antonio, almost 200 miles from the border. I mean, I've seen Border Patrol vehicles

509
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:19,440
pulling people over in Austin, and it's citizens. I've talked to people who've had TSA, we even

510
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:23,000
got photos of it, big black armored vehicles that say TSA.

511
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,300
And they'll come up and rouse women in a parking lot and ask them what they're doing. I mean,

512
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:36,200
it's just a bunch of goons like North Korea. And they go on to break down how they're doing

513
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:41,600
and that's out of the McAllen monitor. I mean, ladies and gentlemen, this is just unbelievable.

514
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:50,440
Now let me move along to this report right here. Nurses fired for refusing shot, KTXS.

515
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:57,720
This is all over the country. Hospital employees had filed appeals citing religious reasons.

516
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:02,640
Six nurses and other employees at hospital in Indiana are out of jobs refusing the flu

517
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:07,660
shot. I just feel like it's a toxin. Well, it says it on the insert, it can kill you.

518
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:12,440
And I don't want it in my body, she told the station. There are side effects. Says that

519
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:16,280
in the insert, I can show you. CDC saying it can kill you. There are no guarantees that

520
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:17,960
it's even going to protect you.

521
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:23,200
The flu shot has never been guessed a year early of what it's actually gonna be. And

522
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:26,600
it lowers your immunity by 50% each time you take it and gives you Alzheimer's. But that's

523
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:33,320
mainline studies. Now let me tell you the story, okay? And we're not ready to give out

524
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:38,680
the info yet because we wanna not play that card right now cuz I'm probably gonna help

525
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:41,040
him litigate.

526
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:49,560
One of my crew members wife had a two pound six ounce baby last week. The baby has brain

527
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:55,880
swelling, the baby has blood going cuz 300 heart beats per minute out of its ventricles

528
00:48:55,880 --> 00:49:02,820
into the lungs, the baby is in critical condition. What's going on at the hospital? And I warned

529
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:07,880
him too cuz it's a city affiliated when I said don't go near your life.

530
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:11,760
You gotta go where rich people go if you're gonna go to a hospital because they don't

531
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:16,960
feed on them yet. If you go to a big mainline mega hospital, folks, they see you as an animal.

532
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:23,200
Or you better show up in diamond rings and top hats because you have a birth plan or

533
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:26,120
whatever, you say on there no vaccines.

534
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:31,040
And the nurses try to pressure you do it, you go, no, I know there's no law, stop saying

535
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:34,760
there is. They're in there telling him, we're not gonna give you your baby. We're gonna

536
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:41,640
take your baby, which is in a lot of trouble. I want you to pray for the baby girl, we're

537
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:43,840
just gonna leave it at that.

538
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:51,960
This is a great guy and great lady, friends of mine, just really good people. And they

539
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:56,280
are in there day one going, you as parents must take the shots or you can't have your

540
00:49:56,280 --> 00:50:01,080
kid, hepatitis, flu, you name it. No law, but they're telling them it is. You understand

541
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:04,880
how criminal that is, but they just do it cuz they're backed up by the police and their

542
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:08,260
ignorance and their evil.

543
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:13,560
And they're in there saying basically that, well, I'm gonna break it down after break.

544
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:18,240
But you remember just four years ago, everybody knew you don't give a pregnant woman a vaccine

545
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:23,400
as the insert says and cause a miscarriage or brain damage the child. And it's just well

546
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:31,980
known for decades. And I got crew here who have wives who are nurses, where they're pregnant.

547
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:35,400
And the hospital's like, okay, you don't have to take the shot cuz you're pregnant cuz the

548
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:37,340
doctors still know that.

549
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:41,880
But now they've come out in the news and said, no, if you're pregnant, you need extra shots.

550
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:47,400
Folks, they wanna just see if they can kill us right out in the open. And they're there,

551
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:54,960
imagine when a mother is in these desperate straits. They forced her to take the shots

552
00:50:54,960 --> 00:51:00,040
outside of law, saying we'll take your baby. It's unbelievable.

553
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:05,960
Injuries, slow healing, aches and pains, constipation, weakness, fatigue are all common the older

554
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:10,240
one gets. The progressive deterioration of the body that occurs almost universally the

555
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:14,560
older one gets can partly to significantly be prevented with conscientious attention

556
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:20,120
to nutrition. If the Hanza men can play rugby in their 90s, then it is possible for everyone

557
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:24,640
in North America to experience a more youthful life as well. One key ingredient to warding

558
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:29,120
off aging and reversing some of it is the type and quality of protein consumed. All

559
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:33,920
protein foods or supplements you currently consume are heat damage, destroying 50 to

560
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:39,840
75% of your ability to utilize the bodybuilding amino acids. One world way is not heat damage

561
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:46,400
and allows your body to utilize 100% of the amino acids. This feat no one else has achieved.

562

585
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:19,320
Let me break down how evil, how criminal, how wicked the TSA, the hospital workers,

586
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:24,840
the police, the whole system, they gang up like gangs and say, we're going to drag you

587
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:28,720
off in a room and stick our hands down your pants. We're the state police. And we'll show

588
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:32,520
some video of that for TV viewers. We're going to pull women over and we're going to get

589
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:33,800
these good looking women out.

590
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:38,440
That's why this was, it's always the same. And we're going to take the same glove and

591
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:43,200
we're going to stick it inside your body. That's America, folks. And the sycophantic

592
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:50,920
fetish of worshiping government is so incredible that people are like, it's the right thing

593
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:55,020
to do. It's for our safety. And they're showing the video now and they go to the next woman.

594
00:54:55,020 --> 00:55:00,980
It's even more incredible. Now same glove, it's on record, here they go. That's on top

595
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:03,520
of all this.

596
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:09,240
Now let's expand on this. One of my crew members, probably the sweetest person that works up

597
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:17,680
here. In fact, no doubt the sweetest person that works up here. They're so excited about

598
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:25,240
having a baby. And of course, the system pushed to have ultrasounds over and over again. And

599
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:29,160
I was like warning them that it's study show that causes this.

600
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:34,720
But the point is, that goes on. There's a medical mafia. And then they're in there for

601
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:39,000
like a week now. And they come in and they go, you're not going to get your baby unless

602
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:43,040
you take shots. And this is somebody that works here and is smart. And they go, there's

603
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:44,040
no law.

604
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:49,280
They're like, yeah, there is. Well, show me the insert. There is no insert. Well, I want

605
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:53,680
the one without mercury. Just see what they go. There is no mercury. It's all just, you're

606
00:55:53,680 --> 00:56:01,520
like, well, yes, there is. It's all just savage lying. And it's called gaslighting. That's

607
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:05,960
one term used in psychology.

608
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:10,560
And it made me physically ill when he was up here with tears in his eyes yesterday.

609
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:16,260
And I just said, go in there, record it. And we'll save a lot of people's children when

610
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:23,560
we put all this out. I said, record it. Get them to all say it again. Record on your iPhone.

611
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:25,320
And we'll get them.

612
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:29,320
You gotta get aggressive with these people, okay? They will tell parents, it's the law,

613
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:34,040
your kids gotta take vaccines. They shoot them up from Alabama to California now without

614
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:39,220
parental consent. And when people sued in California, they got the legislature to pass

615
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:47,400
a law to shoot your kids up and not even tell you, saying the state is the parent.

616
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:52,840
I mean, that's crook. They're like, we got a law to do it. Really, you got a law to do

617
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:59,200
it, huh? Your law is a tyranny. Your law is a fraud. And I've got all the Supreme Court

618
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:04,600
cases, but everybody knows that. I mean, these people are a cult of yes men. And these mega

619
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:11,940
corporations that are eugenicist, they go out and they hire people who will do what

620
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:12,940
they're told.

621
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:17,320
They give you psychological profiles now to get a job at McDonald's. And those profiles

622
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:22,800
on record are set to make sure you'll go along with it. Gaslighting is a form of psychological

623
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:27,900
abuse in which false information is presented with the intent of making a victim doubt his

624
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:30,680
or her own memory, perception, and sanity.

625
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:35,520
That's where they go. They'll say, you have to take the shots as mommy and daddy. And

626
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:42,680
so does the baby. Instances may range simply from the denial by an abuser that previous

627
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:48,240
abuse incidents have occurred, up to the staging of bizarre events by the abuser with the intention

628
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:53,360
of disorienting the victim. And see, the globalist brag, Cass Sunseat at the White House says,

629
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:55,400
they want to disorient us.

630
00:57:55,400 --> 00:58:00,440
All this is like, our bill says we're gonna take your guns, but we're not going to. We're

631
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:06,620
building the trans Texas corridor, but it doesn't exist. And they play these mind games

632
00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:12,500
with people, and that's why people are disoriented. And you watch cartoons and TV. That's why

633
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:15,140
cartoons don't make sense and are all disjointed.

634
00:58:15,140 --> 00:58:20,460
It's on major studies. The kids brains are already wired wrong. They're brain damaged.

635
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:26,480
The general public's in a trance, folks. They've got military control grade systems that have

636
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:32,640
been proven in torture camps by the Chinese, the communist Russians, the Nazis in our government,

637
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:37,920
and they're using it on you. The police are pulling you over, putting their hands up your

638
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:51,240
rear end. This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.

639
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:55,920
Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our

640
00:58:55,920 --> 00:59:01,560
immunity and health. At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing

641
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:07,000
a full selection of silver based products. Our most popular silver based products are

642
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:12,760
the 32 ounce nano silver solutions, our two ounce nano silver nasal applicators as well

643
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:20,400
as our all natural silver soaps. Just released is our 100% natural silver gel. Our new silver

644
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:25,200
gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents which quickly evaporate and leave the silver

645
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:30,740
at the surface. But rather we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin nourishing

646
00:59:30,740 --> 00:59:35,800
chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the

647
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:43,920
silver more effectively. Visit www.silverlungs.com and click on our store page to find what silver

648

based products are best for you. That's www.silverlungs.com.

649
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:33,600
If you just joined us, it makes me physically ill because I empathize. I've told the story

650
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:44,560
of

651
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:49,220
I live out in the country, I can watch these geckos hunt like tigers or lions sitting there

652
01:00:49,220 --> 01:00:56,860
by the light coming out and eating mosquitoes, little fat pink things, a little lizards and

653
01:00:56,860 --> 01:00:58,440
skinks and others.

654
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:02,400
Some of them are like a foot and a half long, some of these lizards, it's like Wild Kingdom

655
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,640
out in the Texas Hill Country.

656
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:08,420
And undoubtedly a couple times a year, especially when it gets cold, they come in the house

657
01:01:08,420 --> 01:01:15,520
and I'll be in the bathroom at night and I feel a crunch.

658
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:19,580
And I turn the light on and there's a little smash gecko, his guts and brain smashed down

659
01:01:19,580 --> 01:01:21,680
and it hurts.

660
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:27,080
Because it's a pointless death and it's a cute little creature and I empathize with

661
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:28,080
it cuz I love life.

662
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:33,320
Now I have proper instincts, I understand to go out and shoot a deer that's a prey animal,

663
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:36,840
butcher it and then eat it, that is a natural progression.

664
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:40,080
If you don't, you get overpopulations of them and they're running out in front of cars everywhere

665
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:42,560
and starving to death, this is just happening in Austin.

666
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:44,720
You're like, where is this going?

667
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:48,160
What are you talking about before Dr. Corsi comes on to get into the Trans Texas corridor,

668
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:51,800
the attack on the Second Amendment, just unprecedented stuff happening, but we have a normalcy bias,

669
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:55,560
even I do now, to just accept it.

670
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:58,600
Warrantless checkpoints where they stick their hands inside your body, it's all being set

671
01:01:58,600 --> 01:01:59,600
up.

672
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:03,000
Then the cops pull you over and just laugh at you cuz they're in the uniform, they're

673
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,440
in the car, they got the power.

674
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:08,520
Doesn't matter they've already been implanted with cancer viruses in the flu shot, doesn't

675
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:13,360
matter they're gonna be in 10, 15 years dead of cancer, 45 years old, they'll never even

676
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:15,560
know what hit them.

677
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:21,480
So there's not even a, it's sad when you're looking at one of these zombies, cuz they're

678
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:27,400
just victims, but you can't get through to them, you can't get through.

679
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:32,640
You're not gonna get through to the zombies, 5% of our forebears said no to the corruption

680
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:37,360
and won, and there's way more than 5% of us really get what's going on, but I wanna say

681
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:41,960
something to mainline conservatives here.

682
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:53,120
It's time for you to realize that the left isn't the left, and the left isn't environmental

683
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:56,880
wackos or stupid or they don't know what they're doing.

684
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:01,920
They know taking guns makes crime go up, they wanna make you their slave.

685
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:09,800
And the reason I got off into empathy is that when I know somebody and their baby is in

686
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:12,680
critical condition fighting for their life.

687
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:20,040
And the nurses are there bullying them and telling the young mother, yeah, you gotta

688
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:24,520
take the shot or you don't get to have the baby, we'll take the baby.

689
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:28,520
That's like saying, come into somebody's door and saying, buy life insurance from me or

690
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:29,880
I'm gonna kidnap your kid.

691
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:36,320
I mean, it's the same thing, but it's, you're in a nurse uniform, well, I better do what

692
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:39,360
you say cuz the nurses have been forced to take it.

693
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:46,080
They're gonna now abuse you and force you to do it outside of law, assaulting you with

694
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:56,920
a deadly weapon proven to be hurting people.

695
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:59,200
It's amazing.

696
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:06,680
And they sit there with gaslighting and I'm telling you, gaslighting is a term used since

697
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:10,120
the 30s and there's other clinical names for it.

698
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:13,360
And it's in psychological warfare manuals that are declassified that I've gone and read

699
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:17,800
and training films that you can look on YouTube, army training psyop manuals of how when they

700
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:21,080
would take over a third world country, how they control people and round them up.

701
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:22,920
Our military has done that.

702
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:27,200
You go watch those psychological warfare videos, just type that in, army psychological warfare

703
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:30,080
videos, and you'll see them from the 50s and stuff.

704
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:34,480
And it's what they're setting up with the checkpoints and the tattletales and all this.

705
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:41,760
And they'll come to you and you're like, you just use the same glove to go in my hind end

706
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:45,920
and then in theirs, and they'll go, there's no glove.

707
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:53,040
And you're like, what do you mean there's no, cuz it never, it's a psych warfare technique.

708
01:04:53,040 --> 01:05:00,720
There's no trans Texas corridor, Israelis don't own guns.

709
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:04,760
Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as

710
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:06,320
you get sick and die?

711
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:08,520

up and use, doesn't require electricity, purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.

724
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:06,200
We have witnessed two terrible storms in the East, but we are still in the eye of the perfect

725
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:07,200
storm.

726
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:11,520
The most devastating economic conditions since the Great Depression, America's worst drought

727
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:16,420
in agricultural history, and now the economic results of the presidential election.

728
01:06:16,420 --> 01:06:19,720
This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.

729
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:24,000
I just doubled down and got even more supplies from eFoods Direct, and I recommend you do

730
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,000
the same.

731
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,640
It's time to get your own supply from eFoods Direct.

732
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:31,240
I know I won't be standing in a bread line trading my freedom for food.

733
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:35,640
I'm taking control of my future, and you're nuts if you don't do the same.

734
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:39,680
Go to eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex to find the specials, and you can start with

735
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:43,440
a holiday gift pack that's normally $80, now under 50 bucks.

736
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:46,040
Remember, I can warn you, but I can't feed you.

737
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:51,000
Call 800-409-5633 or eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.

738
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:55,280
Would you rather prepare six months too early or one day too late?

739
01:06:55,280 --> 01:07:00,080
409-5633 or eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.

740
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:02,920
Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.

741
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:08,120
A prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.

742
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:14,160
The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce

743
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:15,160
to the global takeover.

744
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:21,120
That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfowarsShop.com.

745
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:24,800
These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.

746
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:29,760
You've got the LifeStraw, so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.

747
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:34,600
The Ktor Hand Crank Generator to charge up key equipment during power outages or out

748
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:35,600
in the field.

749
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:38,560
Strategic Relocation, third edition by Joel Skousen.

750
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:41,000
When Disaster Strikes by Matthew Stein.

751
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:45,920
TheraSafe used by Homeland Security to protect yourself during any radiological event.

752
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:48,800
Hand Crank Shortwave AM-FM radios.

753
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:53,140
Everything that we've researched and found to be the best is available at InfowarsShop.com

754
01:07:53,140 --> 01:07:55,920
and your purchase makes our Infowar possible.

755
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:57,100
We're getting prepared.

756
01:07:57,100 --> 01:07:58,100
Are you?

757
01:07:58,100 --> 01:07:59,100
InfowarsShop.com.

758
01:07:59,100 --> 01:08:10,240
Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.

759
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:11,240
You want answers?

760
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:13,400
Well, so does he.

761
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:17,600
He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.

762
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:25,280
And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.

763
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:41,320
My friends, we are in extremely dark times.

764
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:44,080
The darkest of my 17 years on air.

765
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:48,120
And unfortunately, our worst analysis is coming true.

766
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:50,160
The worst case scenario is now unfolding.

767
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:53,840
You can probably tell I'm a lot more serious and focused on air.

768
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:56,920
I'm a lot more angry.

769
01:08:56,920 --> 01:09:00,900
And it's because the globalist are hammer down.

770
01:09:00,900 --> 01:09:03,440
They are going for broke right now.

771
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:06,740
As the big new Brzezinski has said in two council on foreign relations speeches, also

772
01:09:06,740 --> 01:09:11,160
another one in Poland, and in his new book that I read a few months ago.

773
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:15,460
The globalist are in trouble, worldwide there's an awakening.

774
01:09:15,460 --> 01:09:20,440
And so they are going to try to artificially trigger revolutions and put radical Muslims

775
01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:23,560
in charge to destabilize the whole world.

776
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:29,040
And then use that threat to take our liberties, it's the old British game of divide and conquer.

777
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:35,320
Expanding on that, it is in the Illinois Senate, the NRA says it looks like it may pass.

778
01:09:35,320 --> 01:09:39,280
The article is up at infowars.com.

779
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:47,960
It is a physical gun ban of all semi-automatics, revolvers, handguns.

780
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:48,960
You name it.

781
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:56,200
You can reach up infowars.com for viewers and people can actually see that article if

782
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:59,160
they're watching at prisonplanet.tv.

783
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:03,720
But gun ban bill advances to Senate floor.

784
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:08,540
Now notice they use the psychological warfare program of saying we never want your guns.

785
01:10:08,540 --> 01:10:09,920
We don't wanna make you turn them in.

786
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:10,920
That's preposterous.

787
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:13,800
I've played Joe Biden saying it's ridiculous.

788
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:16,460
Nobody's gonna try to take your handguns.

789
01:10:16,460 --> 01:10:18,120
Nobody's gonna try to take your shotgun.

790
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:22,300
He authored an even stronger assault weapons ban that called for them to physically be

791
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:27,480
turned in, that Dianne Feinstein originally turned in, that made you physically turn in

792
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:28,480
all semi-autos.

793
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:32,720
And we played the clip of her saying, I tried to get a bill where Mr. and Mrs. America have

794
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:35,640
to turn in their guns.

795
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:40,120
I'll play that clip later, but if you're a new listener, it was all over the news last

796
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:41,120
week.

797
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:45,620
But then they play this game of we're not doing that, we're not doing that, we're not

798
01:10:45,620 --> 01:10:46,620
doing that.

799
01:10:46,620 --> 01:10:50,200
Dianne Feinstein's introduced her bill that even mainline gun groups are going, it makes

800
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:54,360
you go in with your legally bought guns, and you go into the ATF and then they decide if

801
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:56,040
you can keep them, it's registration.

802
01:10:56,040 --> 01:11:00,200
No, the bill actually says that and a forced buyback.

803
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:06,120
And she's in the New York Times with Cuomo saying we're gonna make you turn them in.

804
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:11,800
And now in Illinois, the area that this mafia controls, Rahm Emanuel and others, we're on

805
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:15,160
the radio in Chicago right now fighting him, a lot of good people up there are exposing

806
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:17,200
it.

807
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:23,720
They're saying, yeah, all state holders of guns, handguns, rifles, revolvers, pump shotguns

808
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:24,720
and pump rifles.

809
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:30,080
Yeah, I saw somebody on infowars.com comment and go, there's such a thing as pump rifles.

810
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:34,040
Yeah, you didn't know there were a lot of pump rifles?

811
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:37,840
Actually some pretty good firearms out there.

812
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:39,720
Lever action, you name it.

813
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:44,400
They basically are banning everything but bolt action and single shot.

814
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:51,080
And they've got the Floyd registration, they always use registration to then confiscate.

815
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:55,520
And they want the Chicago model of a total gun ban for citizens, which has made it the

816
01:11:55,520 --> 01:12:02,120
murder capital of the world, 500 deaths last year, 512 they said.

817
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:03,120
And most of it's getting related.

818
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:08,020
The point is, this is the days of Al Capone, it's gangs killing each other, citizens have

819
01:12:08,020 --> 01:12:09,280
a right to defend themselves.

820
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:13,760
And a lot of those deaths were citizens defending themselves.

821
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:16,680
Dr. Jerome, of course, is gonna join us for the balance of the hour and I appreciate him

822
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:17,680
coming on.

823
01:12:17,680 --> 01:12:20,960
We're gonna get into this, we're gonna get into his article where Perry is still doing

824
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:25,520
public private partnerships, Trans Texas, Napa Super Highway in pieces.

825
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:29,120
And people say, I was on Man Cal yesterday and he said, well, why is it important if

826
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:30,120
it's in Texas?

827
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:35,120
He was asking a rhetorical question, he knew why, a really smart guy, Eric Muller.

828
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:42,400
And I said, Eric, there's 40 plus major interstate highways, another 40 other corollary roads

829
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:48,420
that they, in the official Department of Transportation documents, say they wanna take over, put taxes

830
01:12:48,420 --> 01:12:50,840
on and fund the North American Union with.

831
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:56,640
And it's an artery right down to the Pacific side of Mexico with the biggest port now in

832
01:12:56,640 --> 01:13:00,040
the hemisphere to bring in Chinese goods.

833
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:03,320
And it's an international corridor, like the Romans used roads to control things.

834
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:07,220
And I made the film Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, almost three hours long.

835
01:13:07,220 --> 01:13:11,120
About 30 minutes of it is on this subject and it shows Bush giving speeches saying,

836
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:14,760
we've merged the North American Union with the EU, all the agreements.

837
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:18,480
I mean, we're already way down the hole here.

838
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:21,320
So all of that's going on, and that's what this is about.

839
01:13:21,320 --> 01:13:24,260
We're already under a North American Union.

840
01:13:24,260 --> 01:13:27,120
But the states twice voted it down.

841
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:30,960
Texas is the main funding artery to fund it all the way up into Canada.

842
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:32,980
They've got mile markers all the way to Canada.

843
01:13:32,980 --> 01:13:38,000
It's marked for mile markers all the way for something like 2,000 miles.

844
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:46,280
But they just call it the I-35 shooter round outside Austin.

845
01:13:46,280 --> 01:13:49,120
But it goes all the way to San Antonio, it's there.

846
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:54,240
And CNN, I've played the clubs, you've seen it, would say Ron Paul four years ago is insane.

847
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:58,640
There is no Texas superhighway, there is no trans Texas corridor.

848
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:03,760
We had billboards all over the state with a cowboy going, I like the trans Texas corridor

849
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:04,760
and paying tolls.

850
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:09,720
And they had ads going, yeah, it's trans Texas corridor, Texas is proud to be part of the

851
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:10,720
NAP superhighway system.

852
01:14:10,720 --> 01:14:16,800
I'd go to movies and see ads before the movies going, Texas is a proud part of the North

853
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:19,120
American Union, appreciate all you're doing.

854
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:21,960
Meanwhile, we go, hey, we don't want this, it doesn't exist.

855
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:27,920
And that's a psychological warfare term called gaslighting, is a form of psychological abuse

856
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:33,000
in which false information is presented with the intent of making a victim doubt his or

857
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,560
her own memory, perception, and sanity.

858
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:41,080
Instances may range simply from the denial by an abuser that previous abuse incidents

859
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:46,720
ever occurred, or even the staging of bizarre events by the abuser with the intention of

860
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:47,960
disorienting the victim.

861
01:14:47,960 --> 01:14:51,240
That's why they'll have school drills unannounced where they aim guns at kids.

862
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:53,820
It happened to my crew, who's got kids in public school.

863
01:14:53,820 --> 01:14:57,500
They come and bang on the elementary and say, we're here to kill you, and the kids all cry

864
01:14:57,500 --> 01:14:58,500
and get scared.

865
01:14:58,500 --> 01:15:03,120
And the teachers go, following a manual, we're sorry we had to do this.

866
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:04,920
It's because of American gun owners.

867
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:08,360
In one manual in Michigan, the feds issued it was, we're sorry to do this.

868
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:11,820
This was due to homeschoolers and people against public education.

869
01:15:11,820 --> 01:15:16,640
That's AP, if you think I'm joking, they go, sorry, we just blew up a car in the front

870
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:19,080
parking lot and came and said we were going to kill you.

871
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:23,200
And children literally urinate on themselves, teachers have had to go to funny farms over

872
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:24,200
it.

873
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:27,400
Literally, this has been in the news, have breakdowns where they marched people out saying

874
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:30,060
they're gonna kill them and mask, and don't tell them it's a drill.

875
01:15:30,060 --> 01:15:31,440
That was in Minneapolis, St. Paul.

876
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:32,920
Okay, I'm ranting, we'll go to our guests.

877
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:37,640
I just wanna introduce this, cuz some stations just joined us in this hour.

878
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:42,360
That it is a psychological warfare program, and the police are being brainwashed too to

879
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:44,040
just accept this.

880
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:47,960
Now they're announcing checkpoints all over the country to stop gangs and look for illegal

881
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:48,960
guns.

882
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:52,400
The hammer's being dropped, and Dr. Corsi can break this down.

883
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:56,640
He, of course, has worked with the State Department and National Security in classified areas.

884
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:59,440
He has a Harvard PhD in political science.

885
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:04,240
He's worked for Fortune, top mega banks, you name it.

886
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:08,080
I'm not gonna go over his whole bio, he's, I don't know, three or four number one New

887
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:09,880
York Times bestsellers.

888
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:16,720
But this is the total takeover, and the Republicans, you notice, $1 of cuts for every $41 in tax

889
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:17,720
increases.

890
01:16:17,720 --> 01:16:21,760
77% of Americans, massive tax increases, Obama lying about that.

891
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:24,680
They're announcing total open borders, total legalization.

892
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:28,600
They're going for our guns everywhere, it's on, checkpoints, everything.

893
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:30,960
Dr. Corsi, how bad is it?

894
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:32,360
It's even worse than I thought it would be.

895
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:33,360
What is your take?

896
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:34,960
Why is it moving so quickly?

897
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:38,400
I mean, it is like the dam is broken.

898
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:42,080
Well, I think it's a rush to the finish line.

899
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:45,440
I think the new world order sees an opportunity.

900
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:53,140
With the article I wrote in the World Net Daily WND just over the holidays, it's clear

901
01:16:53,140 --> 01:16:58,200
that Governor Perry, with the trans Texas corridor, that it's back.

902
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:06,340
I mean, I researched it and found that now there's something like $20 billion in road

903
01:17:06,340 --> 01:17:12,480
work underway throughout Texas on these public-private partnerships.

904
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:15,560
That's the key idea, the public-private partnership.

905
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:22,440
In other words, and typically three of the one, three of these deals I looked at in particular,

906
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:33,960
is State Highway 130 near San Antonio, extensions of I-35 around Dallas-Fort Worth, Cintra C-I-N-T-R-A

907
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:39,200
in Spain, which was the company that was going to do the full development of the trans Texas

908
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:45,320
corridor, the 4,000 miles that Governor Perry proposed before we exposed it and they had

909
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:49,000
to withdraw the plan in disgrace.

910
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:55,840
But Cintra's going to build these highways on 50-year leases, where, for instance, let's

911
01:17:55,840 --> 01:18:03,880
say Cintra puts up $5 billion, the state of Texas subsidizes with a billion dollars, Cintra

912
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:11,500
builds the extension to the road, now they're doing it piece by piece, and Cintra gets to

913
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:18,680
run the toll road for 50 years on a 50-year lease, and Cintra in Spain collects the tolls

914
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:22,760
from the motorists driving in Texas.

915
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:27,400
And again, this was something that Governor Perry said he'd put an end to.

916
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:32,120
2009, there was a pledge to end the trans Texas corridor with Cintra.

917
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:35,720
Don't forget, you've seen the collapse where CNN just said it didn't even exist.

918
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:36,720
Right, exactly.

919
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:42,120
I mean, they're still denying that any of this planning exists or that Winnipeg up in

920
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:49,080
Canada has been declared by Prime Minister Harper to be an inland port, and they're building

921
01:18:49,080 --> 01:18:50,080
the same infrastructure.

922
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:54,600
What's incredible is the meetings, the maps, all of it's 100% public, and then they first

923
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:58,480
announced it even in Time Magazine, and then when we don't like it, they go, you're crazy,

924
01:18:58,480 --> 01:18:59,480
that doesn't exist.

925
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:01,680
Well, they deny it, they laugh about it.

926
01:19:01,680 --> 01:19:11,880
If you remember up in Montebello in Canada, when they were asked, Harper and Bush at that

927
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:17,680
time, the president of Mexico, three of them meeting in the Security and Prosperity Partnership,

928
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:24,800
if there was going to be a NAFTA super highway that was going to combine three nations and

929
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:31,400
this continent, North America, into an international transportation system, and Harper laughed

930
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:35,760
at it and he said, oh yes, it may be interplanetary.

931
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:41,080
And then of course he comes out and announces that Winnipeg is going to be an inland port

932
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:46,600
and that the government of Canada is committed to building an international transportation

933
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:50,000
structure that ties into trade in China.

934
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:53,600
Well, it's all in the SPP documents.

935
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:56,120
We're going to be right back to get into this, but then I want to get into the guns with

936
01:19:56,120 --> 01:20:02,080
you, and I want to get into the Middle East, Benghazi, because you're an expert on this.

937
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:06,880
We have witnessed two terrible storms in the East, but we are still in the eye of the perfect

938
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:07,880
storm.

939
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:11,760
The most devastating economic condition since the Great Depression, America's worst drought

940
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:16,560
in agricultural history, and now the economic results of the presidential election.

941
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:19,800
This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.

942
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:24,080
I just doubled down and got even more supplies from E Foods Direct, and I recommend you do

943
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:25,080
the same.

944
01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:27,600
It's time to get your own supply from E Foods Direct.

945
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:31,120
I know I won't be standing in a bread line trading my freedom for food.

946
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:35,480
I'm taking control of my future, and you're nuts if you don't do the same.

947
01:20:35,480 --> 01:20:39,440
Go to efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex to find the specials, and you can start with

952

forward slash Alex.

953
01:21:02,160 --> 01:21:07,640
You land in Buenos Aires, then a shuttle to Santa Rosa, where a nicely furnished cabin

954
01:21:07,640 --> 01:21:13,520
with all amenities, Wi-Fi, executive food and wine, and laundry service awaits.

955
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:16,680
After a good night's sleep, your adventure begins.

956
01:21:16,680 --> 01:21:24,400
You're on a golden stag safari for big game, but it's not Africa, it's Argentina.

The adventure of a lifetime starts at goldenstagsafaris.com, the big game hunting ranch, goldenstagsafaris.com.

962
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:06,480
That's the sound of your door being kicked in by an intruder with a single kick.

963
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:11,640
That's the sound of the same door now protected by the door sentinel at mysafedoor.com.

That's mysafedoor.com.

968
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:30,680
Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

969
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:34,400
Have you ever wondered why banks, stock workers, investment advisors won't talk about gold

970
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:35,400
IRAs?

971
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:39,460
They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value

972
01:22:39,460 --> 01:22:41,160
of gold for your retirement.

973
01:22:41,160 --> 01:22:44,640
Gold is outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

974
01:22:44,640 --> 01:22:49,620
If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.

977
01:22:58,280 --> 01:23:00,440
Hi there.

978
01:23:00,440 --> 01:23:01,440
My name is Frank Bates.

979
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:05,720
What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble.

980
01:23:05,720 --> 01:23:11,960
I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity

981
01:23:11,960 --> 01:23:16,560
monopolies and government agencies for what they really are, incompetent, lying crooks

982
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:21,800
that are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high.

983
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:25,800
Some have called this a conspiracy, others have called it a coverup, and you will be

984
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:29,700
shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy goes.

985
01:23:29,700 --> 01:23:35,360
My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them

986
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:37,680
and how you can beat them too.

987
01:23:37,680 --> 01:23:41,520
Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen

988
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:43,240
in the last three months.

989
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:48,640
Go to 123coverup.com and discover one weird trick to slash your power bill and protect

990
01:23:48,640 --> 01:23:49,640
your home.

991
01:23:49,640 --> 01:23:55,480
Go watch my video now at 123coverup.com before they force me to shut it down.

992
01:23:55,480 --> 01:24:20,080
Again, that's 123coverup.com.

993
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:24,000
To be kind to Dr. Jerome Corsi, who's with us again, I'm your host, Alex Jones.

994
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:29,080
I've been right up front in this, going to the Campo board meetings, watching the takeover,

995
01:24:29,080 --> 01:24:32,120
reading the SPP documents that Judicial Watch sued and got.

996
01:24:32,120 --> 01:24:38,080
And I know Dr. Corsi's been on this even more than I have, but watching in Texas, they don't

997
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:39,720
even follow their agreements.

998
01:24:39,720 --> 01:24:44,680
In fact, most of the new toll road stuff is built off existing toll roads on roads they're

999
01:24:44,680 --> 01:24:46,100
not even supposed to put them on.

1000
01:24:46,100 --> 01:24:48,040
They break the law and do that.

1001
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:51,240
Bush signed an executive order, I guess they say that makes it all right.

1002
01:24:51,240 --> 01:24:56,200
I guess they could sign an executive order saying the moon was made of cheese.

1003
01:24:56,200 --> 01:25:00,680
And then most of these new roads get paid for with taxpayer money, and then Central

1004
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:01,680
just gets the money.

1005
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:04,680
But I wanna get into that, and that's why I originally asked the guys to get you on

1006
01:25:04,680 --> 01:25:06,440
Dr. Corsi, and I appreciate you coming on.

1007
01:25:06,440 --> 01:25:09,360
But what about the overall, I'm gonna go back into it.

1008
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:14,040
I know you're focused on this now, but what about the overall going after the guns?

1009
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:20,160
I know you've been writing about that, and the Republicans selling out to massive tax

1010
01:25:20,160 --> 01:25:21,160
increases.

1011
01:25:21,160 --> 01:25:25,520
I mean, they're trying to collectivize this country, they know massive tax increases are

1012
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:27,200
gonna shut the economy off.

1013
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:30,480
But I guess that's the plan to get people on welfare.

1014
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:31,480
Let's first deal with the guns.

1015
01:25:31,480 --> 01:25:39,320
I mean, I wrote an article also sent it in to your producers there on the shooting that

1016
01:25:39,320 --> 01:25:46,040
was the recent shooting in the elementary school in Sandy Hook.

1017
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:51,640
And I interviewed some of the top psychiatrists in the world, Dr. David Healy, who was in

1018
01:25:51,640 --> 01:25:57,940
Great Britain, Peter Bragan, Harvard-trained, formerly full-time consultant to the National

1019
01:25:57,940 --> 01:26:00,320
Institute of Mental Health.

1020
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:07,200
And they universally told me that these kids who are shooting in the schools, these incidences

1021
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:15,080
are almost 90% linked with the medications prescribed to these kids by psychiatrists.

1022
01:26:15,080 --> 01:26:20,240
In other words, what happens is the school shootings, a kid, let's say, in school is

1023
01:26:20,240 --> 01:26:24,480
a little bit difficult to deal with and maybe has some problems at home.

1024
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:30,380
So immediately, the doctors come in and they diagnose the kid as having some psychological

1025
01:26:30,380 --> 01:26:33,420
disorder or an attention deficit disorder.

1026
01:26:33,420 --> 01:26:39,240
They put him, get him psychiatric treatment and put him on forced medication, Ritalin

1027
01:26:39,240 --> 01:26:44,820
or Prozac or any number of other very powerful drugs.

1028
01:26:44,820 --> 01:26:51,040
And these are psychotropic drugs that they produce, especially in these adolescents,

1029
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:57,200
a form of suicidal and violent outbursts.

1030
01:26:57,200 --> 01:27:04,200
So if you look at the incidents that have occurred and track down who these shooters

1031
01:27:04,200 --> 01:27:09,760
are, you're going to find that about 90%, especially the high-profile cases, these kids

1032
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:16,160
were on medication prescribed by psychiatrists, on behavioral problems, which may or may not

1033
01:27:16,160 --> 01:27:21,680
have been real or may have just been an attempt to control a difficult kid in a school environment.

1034
01:27:21,680 --> 01:27:23,960
And by the way, I covered your article last week.

1035
01:27:23,960 --> 01:27:28,500
And when you say 90%, that these scientists, these doctors are being conservative, they

1036
01:27:28,500 --> 01:27:33,840
count the few gang-related shootings where three or four people shoot each other as in

1037
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:34,840
that.

1038
01:27:34,840 --> 01:27:38,000
And in those cases, they're usually just drug dealers.

1039
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,020
So that's why it goes down to 90.

1040
01:27:40,020 --> 01:27:47,360
If you look at the real mass shootings, it's always goth whites or Hispanics who are avowed

1041
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:48,360
devil worshipers.

1042
01:27:48,360 --> 01:27:54,500
I mean, every case, they are into the occult, they are avowed devil worshipers, and they

1043
01:27:54,500 --> 01:27:56,080
are on psychotropic drugs.

1044
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:58,000
I mean, it's more like 100%.

1045
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:03,500
In fact, I can't find cases where the real mass shooters where it's like 10, 15, 20 people

1046
01:28:03,500 --> 01:28:05,960
and it's not gang-related aren't on these drugs.

1047
01:28:05,960 --> 01:28:09,960
Well, in fact, Dr. Bragan was particularly good.

1048
01:28:09,960 --> 01:28:14,240
He said a lot of these kids are just kids that in a normal environment, you go back

1049
01:28:14,240 --> 01:28:19,920
40, 50 years, first of all, you'd have God in the school, you'd have parents around that

1050
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:21,720
could be involved.

1051
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:25,440
The kid might need some attention, might be a lonely kid.

1052
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:29,800
Now the school, which doesn't really want to deal with the kids in general, in particular,

1053
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:34,040
they don't want to spend any teacher time, the teachers aren't trained.

1054
01:28:34,040 --> 01:28:39,000
So they get the psychiatrist involved, they prescribe these extremely powerful drugs.

1055
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:44,320
They put them on suicide pills, the insert says cause you to commit mass murder and suicide.

1056
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:49,360
And these pills are extremely dangerous, psychotropic effects, which produce the suicidal tendencies

1057
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:51,040
of the violent tendencies.

1058
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:57,520
The kids further withdraw, they withdraw into these video games, which are killing video

1059
01:28:57,520 --> 01:29:02,760
games in this created world of fantasy of killing and violence.

1060
01:29:02,760 --> 01:29:08,640
And then when these kids acted out in reality in a school, people are surprised.

1061
01:29:08,640 --> 01:29:10,400
I mean, there's no reason to be surprised.

1062
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:18,640
Doctor, doctor, if you study Chinese style mind control and CIA, it's drugging with scenarios.

1063
01:29:18,640 --> 01:29:24,240
These video games were designed to create instinctive killing by the US military, non-thinking.

1064
01:29:24,240 --> 01:29:29,640
You put them on mind control drugs and put them on a Pentagon killing simulator.

1065
01:29:29,640 --> 01:29:30,840
What do you think you're going to get?

1066
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:35,760
Well, and in fact, a lot of these video games were created by the military in order to increase

1067
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:40,960
the percentage of soldiers in combat that would actually use lethal force.

1068
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:46,720
It's one of the little, little appreciated secrets of combat going back to the...

1069
01:29:46,720 --> 01:29:50,080
Break this down, doctor, break it down on the other side, we'll be right back.

1070
01:29:50,080 --> 01:30:00,680
We're on the march, the empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.

1071
01:30:00,680 --> 01:30:04,960
Millions of people are going to get sick this winter from colds, flu and other illnesses.

1072
01:30:04,960 --> 01:30:06,040
Don't be one of them.

other harmful pathogens.

This new technology has the ability to terminate entire colonies of harmful bacteria at several

1082

hundred times the effectiveness of colloidal or ionic silver solutions.

1119
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:05,840
There's an old saying in Tennessee, I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee, that

1120
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:11,720
says fool me once, shame on me.

1121
01:33:11,720 --> 01:33:12,720
Shame on you.

1122
01:33:12,720 --> 01:33:15,600
If you fool me, you can't get fooled again.

1123
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:21,400
He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.

1124
01:33:21,400 --> 01:33:25,440
You're listening to Alex Jones.

1125
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:32,760
You know, Dr. Corsi is probably more qualified to talk about Benghazi than anybody I probably

1126
01:33:32,760 --> 01:33:33,760
know.

1127
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:36,800
And I should have gotten him on the last few months about that, it's just that it gets

1128
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:41,000
lost in the shuffle, and I'm jumping in, chomping at the bit, wanting to back up everything

1129
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,320
he says because it's so on target.

1130
01:33:43,320 --> 01:33:48,280
I wanna get into that and Hillary's feigned garbage and all this other stuff that's going

1131
01:33:48,280 --> 01:33:51,520
on and where he sees America in general going.

1132
01:33:51,520 --> 01:33:56,840
I mean, does he agree with my analysis that it is just runaway train right now?

1133
01:33:56,840 --> 01:33:59,040
Is there any way to stop the takeover?

1134
01:33:59,040 --> 01:34:00,920
Why do the globalists think it's their opportunity?

1135
01:34:00,920 --> 01:34:03,820
Is it a response to seeing an awakening happening?

1136
01:34:03,820 --> 01:34:06,560
They're trying to head us off at the pass.

1137
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:07,720
I wanna get his take on that.

1138
01:34:07,720 --> 01:34:14,320
I wanna go back into the Napa superhighway because it ties in to this tactic now that

1139
01:34:14,320 --> 01:34:19,440
those of us that are awake go, this is ridiculous and discrediting that they announced there's

1140
01:34:19,440 --> 01:34:21,440
no global government being formed.

1141
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:24,920
But in hundreds of financial papers, they brag how they're forming a world government

1142
01:34:24,920 --> 01:34:26,740
run by private banks.

1143
01:34:26,740 --> 01:34:28,640
So why are they doing that?

1144
01:34:28,640 --> 01:34:32,840
Well, cuz we're informed the general public folks doesn't know where their state capital

1145
01:34:32,840 --> 01:34:33,840
is.

1146
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:38,000
You have to understand, people think of knowing things as work.

1147
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:42,980
They never discover that knowing things is addictive and is what really being alive is.

1148
01:34:42,980 --> 01:34:50,680
And so you gotta understand, I mean, the general public is just not even dumb, they're ignorant.

1149
01:34:50,680 --> 01:34:58,080
And this tactic of just lying, I mean, at hospitals everywhere, everybody I know goes

1150
01:34:58,080 --> 01:35:01,600
into the hospital and they say, we're not gonna fix your broken leg till you take a

1151
01:35:01,600 --> 01:35:02,600
flu shot.

1152
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:06,280
And they're like, but you have to render care and they go, we're not going to, get out.

1153
01:35:06,280 --> 01:35:12,040
I mean, it's totally illegal on so many fronts, I mean, I've had lawyers on, it's unbelievable.

1154
01:35:12,040 --> 01:35:17,640
That's what tyranny is, it's a willful criminal oppression.

1155
01:35:17,640 --> 01:35:20,380
And they're just doing it.

1156
01:35:20,380 --> 01:35:24,220
And now they're gonna set up armored checkpoints all over the highways to quote, check for

1157
01:35:24,220 --> 01:35:26,320
gang members.

1158
01:35:26,320 --> 01:35:27,320
It's just incredible.

1159
01:35:27,320 --> 01:35:31,280
Dr. Corsi, getting back to what you were gonna talk about with, for those that don't know,

1160
01:35:31,280 --> 01:35:36,720
the statistics from World War I, World War II, on troops wouldn't kill people up close.

1161
01:35:36,720 --> 01:35:41,580
So the Department of Defense developed, and you're right, this is something even foreign

1162
01:35:41,580 --> 01:35:43,620
governments really didn't pick up on for a while.

1163
01:35:43,620 --> 01:35:49,480
It's given the quote, United States the edge, murder simulators, killer simulators, tell

1164
01:35:49,480 --> 01:35:50,480
people about that.

1165
01:35:50,480 --> 01:35:56,680
Well, these original combat video games were developed by the military around the time

1166
01:35:56,680 --> 01:35:58,520
of Vietnam.

1167
01:35:58,520 --> 01:36:03,680
Because the little known secret is that in combat, most of the killing in person is done

1168
01:36:03,680 --> 01:36:05,280
by two or three percent of the troops.

1169
01:36:05,280 --> 01:36:10,680
A lot of troops will not use violence, lethal violence where they can actually see the enemy,

1170
01:36:10,680 --> 01:36:13,120
even when they're in danger themselves.

1171
01:36:13,120 --> 01:36:19,280
So in Vietnam, our troops exposed to these kinds of games were able to get the kill ratio

1172
01:36:19,280 --> 01:36:20,280
up to about 90%.

1173
01:36:20,280 --> 01:36:24,960
90% of the people in combat would be willing to use lethal force.

1174
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:30,280
And that's where these games started, because psychologically, they engineered desensitization,

1175
01:36:30,280 --> 01:36:36,000
their desensitized process to where killing another human being or using lethal force

1176
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:39,320
against another human being is no longer repugnant.

1177
01:36:39,320 --> 01:36:44,240
It becomes acceptable in the frame of behavior for the person to find for themselves.

1178
01:36:44,240 --> 01:36:50,960
That in combination with the type of psychotropic drugs that we are regularly handing out in

1179
01:36:50,960 --> 01:36:54,200
our schools is a formula for disaster.

1180
01:36:54,200 --> 01:37:00,360
These kids play these games, get programmed for violence, take the drugs, the drugs affect

1181
01:37:00,360 --> 01:37:04,400
their psychology, their thinking, they become suicidal and violent.

1182
01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:06,480
And then we wonder why we have the incidents of the schools.

1183
01:37:06,480 --> 01:37:10,080
And we wonder why the military has record suicide, and we wonder why the US, the number

1184
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:12,760
one cause of death now is suicide.

1185
01:37:12,760 --> 01:37:17,120
Wasn't in the top 10, 50 years ago, in fact, folks, you can show ABC News, number one cause

1186
01:37:17,120 --> 01:37:19,240
of unnatural death, now suicide.

1187
01:37:19,240 --> 01:37:24,920
You're a nation on suicide mass murder pills, and the social engineers know this full well.

1188
01:37:24,920 --> 01:37:26,720
Of course they do.

1189
01:37:26,720 --> 01:37:31,520
And I want to skip to, with the time we've got, I've been writing again about the economics.

1190
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:38,120
I have an article out today that Ben Bernanke, in the time he's been in the Fed, which started

1191
01:37:38,120 --> 01:37:46,600
in February 1, 2006, on December 12th, which is when they announced this QE4, another round

1192
01:37:46,600 --> 01:37:48,920
of buying our own debt.

1193
01:37:48,920 --> 01:37:57,760
That period of time, from 2006 to December 12th, 2012, Bernanke doubled the amount of

1194
01:37:57,760 --> 01:37:59,320
national debt.

1195
01:37:59,320 --> 01:38:07,840
We went from $8.13 trillion to $16.4 trillion.

1196
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:13,560
And this is, again, another conscious process of destroying the United States.

1197
01:38:13,560 --> 01:38:21,840
The QE4, Quantitative Easing 4, which is the economist's term for it, means that we're

1198
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:31,240
going to be buying monthly $85 billion of our own treasury securities and mortgage backed

1199
01:38:31,240 --> 01:38:39,520
securities, which keeps interest rates artificially low, but is essentially creating so much liquidity

1200
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:45,720
that the dollar is becoming debased, and it's setting up the precondition for hyperinflation.

1201
01:38:45,720 --> 01:38:48,460
Hyperinflation is now an inevitability.

1202
01:38:48,460 --> 01:38:50,120
It's built into the system.

1203
01:38:50,120 --> 01:38:55,940
And again, the economists know this, because in the crisis of hyperinflation, crisis of

1204
01:38:55,940 --> 01:39:00,840
all these mountains of debt, the Americans will give up freedom, they'll move into an

1205
01:39:00,840 --> 01:39:03,080
international environment, they'll allow the-

1206
01:39:03,080 --> 01:39:08,560
And by the way, you worked in banking at the highest level, so again, you are uniquely

1207
01:39:08,560 --> 01:39:09,720
able to speak to this.

1208
01:39:09,720 --> 01:39:10,720
What's the timeframe?

1209
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:11,720
How bad is it going to get?

1210
01:39:11,720 --> 01:39:16,560
Well, it's going to get, first of all, we're going to be at a point where we may double

1211
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:23,240
again the national debt, not within, may not take us six years this time.

1212
01:39:23,240 --> 01:39:26,080
We may do it within three or four years.

1213
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:31,160
Certainly, we're going to be over $20 trillion by 2014.

1214
01:39:31,160 --> 01:39:37,760
And when we get over $20 trillion, remember, our gross national product is under $16 trillion.

1215
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:38,800
Unbelievable.

1216
01:39:38,800 --> 01:39:46,400
So by the end of 2014, which is in two years, when we're coming up with the next congressional

1217
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:51,400
election, I expect us to be in another economic crisis of hyperinflation.

1218
01:39:51,400 --> 01:39:54,780
And this whole deal of fiscal cliff is a fiction.

1219
01:39:54,780 --> 01:39:59,260
We went over the fiscal cliff a long time ago.

1220
01:39:59,260 --> 01:40:05,420
This recent legislation did nothing to solve the fiscal crisis of the United States.

1221
01:40:05,420 --> 01:40:10,280
We actually have more spending in the bill that was just signed, just passed, in this

1222
01:40:10,280 --> 01:40:12,560
emergency fashion.

1223
01:40:12,560 --> 01:40:16,160
And the idea that people, again, lies were rampant.

1224
01:40:16,160 --> 01:40:20,120
Obama was saying that no middle class taxes were going to be increased.

1225
01:40:20,120 --> 01:40:26,240
77% of Americans who pay taxes are going to have an increase because of the phasing out

1226
01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:33,800
of the 2% relief that was granted on the FICA reductions on payroll taxes.

1227
01:40:33,800 --> 01:40:36,160
That's going back in.

1228
01:40:36,160 --> 01:40:40,600
Even though this lie was told, Obama will say, well, I didn't mean that.

1229
01:40:40,600 --> 01:40:44,680
But people are still going to get smaller take home pay, and they can judge for themselves

1230
01:40:44,680 --> 01:40:46,520
whether they were lied to.

1231
01:40:46,520 --> 01:40:48,640
The federal government lies to us regularly.

1232
01:40:48,640 --> 01:40:56,040
The Obama now lies boldly and doesn't even get called for it by the mainstream media.

1233
01:40:56,040 --> 01:41:01,600
And this whole idea of increasing our debt to a proportion that's unprecedented in the

1234
01:41:01,600 --> 01:41:06,440
history of the world, you know, buying our own debt, I mean, you have to get your mind

1235
01:41:06,440 --> 01:41:12,640
around the Treasury is issuing debt and we are buying it in the Federal Reserve.

1236
01:41:12,640 --> 01:41:14,640
It's so insane.

1237
01:41:14,640 --> 01:41:17,840
And at some point or other, you can't keep doing this.

1238
01:41:17,840 --> 01:41:20,320
You can't keep printing money.

1239
01:41:20,320 --> 01:41:22,960
This is just blatantly printing money.

1240
01:41:22,960 --> 01:41:27,600
And the liquidity may boost the stock market, but eventually, like the Weimar Republic,

1241
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:33,720
you get into hyperinflation, and the authorities doing this, including Ben Bernanke, know that

1242
01:41:33,720 --> 01:41:36,880
it is inevitable that they're going to debase the dollar.

1243
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:40,080
In fact, it's a plan to debase the dollar.

1244
01:41:40,080 --> 01:41:43,600
You can't look at it any other way.

1245
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:48,880
Now I wrote, I mean, I've also got, I sent in the links, I just published a book on Obama's

1246
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:56,100
plan to bankrupt the United States, and this goes to the Cloward-Piven theory, and I really

1247
01:41:56,100 --> 01:41:58,480
think it's critical people understand what the Cloward-

1248
01:41:58,480 --> 01:42:01,760
And we're gonna put your new book up, and we've been showing WorldNetDaily and the information.

1249
01:42:01,760 --> 01:42:05,240
In fact, I wanna get this book, I haven't read it yet, we've carried your other books,

1250
01:42:05,240 --> 01:42:10,240
but I know this is gonna be powerful because I know they're game playing as well, and what's

1251
01:42:10,240 --> 01:42:15,140
incredible is, and I know you know about this, you've written about it, they brag that they're

1252
01:42:15,140 --> 01:42:16,760
bankrupting us.

1253
01:42:16,760 --> 01:42:19,940
Communists don't bankrupt things on accident.

1254
01:42:19,940 --> 01:42:24,280
We always say communists are bad managers, and quote, things don't work.

1255
01:42:24,280 --> 01:42:29,280
Because of the incredible production of the last 100 years and science, even in a communist

1256
01:42:29,280 --> 01:42:35,160
system that wasn't run by devils, it'd be horrible and it would be unfair, but everything

1257
01:42:35,160 --> 01:42:36,700
wouldn't collapse.

1258
01:42:36,700 --> 01:42:39,920
They collapsed Ukraine and Poland on purpose.

1259
01:42:39,920 --> 01:42:41,680
This is not a secret.

1260
01:42:41,680 --> 01:42:47,220
They collapsed China and killed between 60 and 80 million people, they debate the numbers,

1261
01:42:47,220 --> 01:42:50,160
to radically transform forever.

1262
01:42:50,160 --> 01:42:52,940
They understand you've gotta break eggs to make an omelet.

1263
01:42:52,940 --> 01:42:58,040
It's about the control, and so the goal is going well.

1264
01:42:58,040 --> 01:43:02,960
More people in prison, more people on welfare, paying to ship General Motors to China.

1265
01:43:02,960 --> 01:43:07,680
I mean, this is a plan, and I've read the review of your book, I know it breaks down

1266
01:43:07,680 --> 01:43:09,920
where they say it's their plan.

1267
01:43:09,920 --> 01:43:15,840
So explain to people, California when they raise taxes over and over again, that's meant

1268
01:43:15,840 --> 01:43:17,080
to bankrupt the state.

1269
01:43:17,080 --> 01:43:18,920
I mean, explain this to people.

1270
01:43:18,920 --> 01:43:24,360
Concord and Piven were two sociologists at Columbia when Obama was there, when Brzezinski

1271
01:43:24,360 --> 01:43:25,560
was there.

1272
01:43:25,560 --> 01:43:32,640
And their whole idea was that to destroy capitalism, you create social welfare programs, all the

1273
01:43:32,640 --> 01:43:39,360
unemployment insurance, the Obama phones, the entire list of programs where the government

1274
01:43:39,360 --> 01:43:42,280
is paying checks to people.

1275
01:43:42,280 --> 01:43:48,320
And you build this system to the point where it is so huge, you've gotta raise the tax

1276
01:43:48,320 --> 01:43:55,480
base in order to pay these welfare payments, social welfare payments, entitlements, that

1277
01:43:55,480 --> 01:44:02,240
the system collapses because the taxes destroy the economic activity, the tax base decreases,

1278
01:44:02,240 --> 01:44:04,520
the system goes into bankruptcy.

1279
01:44:04,520 --> 01:44:09,100
And then the, Cloward and Piven, the sociologists said that this is the time when we really

1280
01:44:09,100 --> 01:44:17,000
have the opportunity to create a true socialist, read communist state, in which the principles

1281
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:23,480
of social justice, meaning destroying private property, destroying the family, having government

1282
01:44:23,480 --> 01:44:28,480
control of every aspect of your life, having the bureaucrats make all decisions, including

1283
01:44:28,480 --> 01:44:34,800
death panels on health insurance, 100% government control of all the means of production.

1284
01:44:34,800 --> 01:44:38,640
This is what the communist dream has been, and the Cloward and Piven theory is a way

1285
01:44:38,640 --> 01:44:47,880
to make the Democratic Party essentially advocate the socialist themes, welfare.

1286
01:44:47,880 --> 01:44:52,200
We're trying to help you, we care about you, want unemployment insurance.

1287
01:44:52,200 --> 01:44:57,240
And then by putting the tax burden to these unreasonable levels, having debt go beyond

1288
01:44:57,240 --> 01:45:01,760
the ability to pay the debt off, the system goes into bankruptcy, collapses, and then

1289
01:45:01,760 --> 01:45:07,120
the ashes, out of the ashes is born a true socialist communist state.

1290
01:45:07,120 --> 01:45:08,120
That's the goal, that's Obama's-

1291
01:45:08,120 --> 01:45:13,640
And they're gonna look to the 90% that don't have jobs anymore from over taxation and say,

1292
01:45:13,640 --> 01:45:19,400
we gotta kill the old people, they're already saying this in slate and Soros outfits.

1293
01:45:19,400 --> 01:45:24,600
I mean, it's so diabolical, and remember doctor, they always said, there's no death panels

1294
01:45:24,600 --> 01:45:25,980
or like it's in the bill.

1295
01:45:25,980 --> 01:45:28,840
No, there's not, there's no NAFTA highway.

1296
01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:34,520
What do you make of them coming out and saying that Israelis don't own guns and they don't

1297
01:45:34,520 --> 01:45:35,520
arm teachers?

1298
01:45:35,520 --> 01:45:41,240
I mean, the level of lying, these people make the Politburo look honest.

1299
01:45:41,240 --> 01:45:49,160
In fact, the Democrats were gonna propose this legislation, in themselves own guns that

1300
01:45:49,160 --> 01:45:51,320
are protected by guns.

1301
01:45:51,320 --> 01:45:55,320
If you go into a federal building, you try to go into the US Congress, you're gonna go

1302
01:45:55,320 --> 01:46:00,840
through metal detectors, you're gonna go through all kinds of federal agencies with badges,

1303
01:46:00,840 --> 01:46:04,400
with guns, examining everything you've got before you get in that building.

1304
01:46:04,400 --> 01:46:07,120
Why don't you know where you're gonna go?

1305
01:46:07,120 --> 01:46:14,160
The bureaucrats that want these gun-free environments don't themselves operate in a gun-free environment

1306
01:46:14,160 --> 01:46:16,080
because they know how dangerous it would be.

1307
01:46:16,080 --> 01:46:18,480
Well, they're mafia, mafia always wants to disarm its slaves.

1308
01:46:18,480 --> 01:46:21,520
Here's my question, what is the general prognosis?

1309
01:46:21,520 --> 01:46:26,680
Am I right, and Larry Pratt saying this is the worst assault ever, Ron Paul, I mean,

1310
01:46:26,680 --> 01:46:29,040
I want your view on this and then your analysis.

1311
01:46:29,040 --> 01:46:35,480
How bad is it because they now look gleeful and are attacking on every front and the Republican

1312
01:46:35,480 --> 01:46:40,280
leadership is collapsing and just saying, yes, this is what we're gonna do because the

1313
01:46:40,280 --> 01:46:43,400
foreign banks are buying both sides.

1314
01:46:43,400 --> 01:46:51,520
The GOP is in disarray, the globalists and the socialists who, the far left, the bill

1315
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:56,640
of errors crowd has stolen the leadership of the Democratic Party.

1316
01:46:56,640 --> 01:47:03,600
This is not the Democratic Party of Jack Kennedy or Hubert Humphrey or Harry Truman.

1317
01:47:03,600 --> 01:47:05,240
That party's dead.

1318
01:47:05,240 --> 01:47:12,880
This is the radical left, the socialists, read communists, hijacking the Democratic

1319
01:47:12,880 --> 01:47:16,240
Party and putting their agenda in the name of progressive.

1320
01:47:16,240 --> 01:47:21,480
I saw another slight article today calling to get rid of our free speech.

1321
01:47:21,480 --> 01:47:24,360
I mean, these people are monsters.

1322
01:47:24,360 --> 01:47:32,000
Diets are gonna be left and right, you get a Sandy Hook coming on immediately, the new

1323
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:37,080
world order agenda jumps on this for gun legislation, the worst possible thing.

1324
01:47:37,080 --> 01:47:42,640
And then when the NRA tries to hold a press conference, they get ridiculed by the mainstream

1325
01:47:42,640 --> 01:47:48,360
media, there's demonstrations, the acting up, the agenda is not heard, the lies are

1326
01:47:48,360 --> 01:47:53,280
being told, yes, teachers are armed in Israel.

1327
01:47:53,280 --> 01:48:01,280
Yes, if you walk around Israel, there are automatic weapons being held by off duty military

1328
01:48:01,280 --> 01:48:02,960
in uniform.

1329
01:48:02,960 --> 01:48:07,200
It's a very militarized environment because it's the only way it's safe.

1330
01:48:07,200 --> 01:48:13,080
And in fact, if you do create these gun free zones, the truth is like Chicago, you're gonna

1331
01:48:13,080 --> 01:48:15,560
create a free killing zone.

1332
01:48:15,560 --> 01:48:17,600
And then they bring the military in as the answer.

1333
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:18,600
See how they do it?

1334
01:48:18,600 --> 01:48:23,040
They take the citizens' guns, it becomes a crime system, then they bring in troops, which

1335
01:48:23,040 --> 01:48:24,800
is they're now doing.

1336
01:48:24,800 --> 01:48:29,560
Rely on the government to protect you, which is exactly, our founding fathers' advice is

1337
01:48:29,560 --> 01:48:33,040
do not rely on the government to do anything for you.

1338
01:48:33,040 --> 01:48:34,880
Let me ask you this, are they going to win?

1339
01:48:34,880 --> 01:48:36,360
I mean, how bad is it?

1340
01:48:36,360 --> 01:48:42,840
Well, it's gonna be, it's the closest to the globalist and the socialist communists left

1341
01:48:42,840 --> 01:48:47,000
winning, and they're using the Saul Alinsky agenda.

1342
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:51,560
Obama is gonna, again, you've gotta read these two ebooks I wrote, the one on the Saul Alinsky,

1343
01:48:51,560 --> 01:48:56,960
the evil genius behind Obama, and Obama's plan to bankrupt the USA, the Cloward-Pippin

1344
01:48:56,960 --> 01:49:00,280
theory, cuz it explains what they're doing.

1345
01:49:00,280 --> 01:49:06,400
They're using the class warfare, resentment against the rich, we've gotta tax the rich.

1346
01:49:06,400 --> 01:49:12,760
Even with Obama getting this agreement on the fiscal cliff, he's already saying in videotape

1347
01:49:12,760 --> 01:49:19,940
presentations to his constituency, the Obama for America crowd, that he hasn't taxed, which

1348
01:49:19,940 --> 01:49:21,880
are still not paying their fair share.

1349
01:49:21,880 --> 01:49:22,880
They won't have-

1350
01:49:22,880 --> 01:49:26,160
Howard Dean came out and said the poorest people need to pay more taxes.

1351
01:49:26,160 --> 01:49:32,240
Well, in fact, the point is that the socialist agenda, nobody in the end owns any private

1352
01:49:32,240 --> 01:49:33,240
property.

1353
01:49:33,240 --> 01:49:37,720
Except the master bureaucrats who are exempt from all the rules.

1354
01:49:37,720 --> 01:49:43,440
And are protected by the military, do not themselves live in gun-free zones, don't give

1355
01:49:43,440 --> 01:49:45,840
up their weapons, but in fact-

1356
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:49,800
No, no, they all have bodyguards, that's a status symbol of them.

1357
01:49:49,800 --> 01:49:57,920
Bodyguards, go into a federal building that you don't have to go through a metal detector

1358
01:49:57,920 --> 01:49:58,920
with badges and guns-

1359
01:49:58,920 --> 01:50:03,680
Michael Moore has five to six bodyguards every time I've seen him, it appears Morgan has

1360
01:50:03,680 --> 01:50:06,760
armed bodyguards, I mean, it's all on record.

1361
01:50:06,760 --> 01:50:13,880
Hypocrisy and the lying of the New World Order and this Bill Ayers left, that Obama left,

1362
01:50:13,880 --> 01:50:15,560
has never been greater.

1363
01:50:15,560 --> 01:50:20,480
They're lying about everything saying, although we don't have a NAFTA superhighway, there's

1364
01:50:20,480 --> 01:50:22,320
no public-private partnerships here.

1365
01:50:22,320 --> 01:50:28,880
Then you look and you find there's $20 billion of deals that Governor Perry has signed with

1366
01:50:28,880 --> 01:50:30,040
Central and Spain.

1367
01:50:30,040 --> 01:50:36,280
No, no, they bragged in the AP years ago, they said Perry's just going ahead in chunks.

1368
01:50:36,280 --> 01:50:41,520
I mean, it's not a secret, they just laugh at us and incredible, incredible, just stay

1369
01:50:41,520 --> 01:50:45,520
there Doc, we gotta get a break, I wanna come back and get more into just the economy.

1370
01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:47,960
I mean, is there any way to turn this around?

1371
01:50:47,960 --> 01:50:48,960
How bad is it gonna get?

1372
01:50:48,960 --> 01:50:53,400
And then we'll have the third hour with a bunch of special reports we're gonna premiere

1373
01:50:53,400 --> 01:50:58,360
here and a bunch of news and so much more, we just gotta get the word out.

1374
01:50:58,360 --> 01:51:02,400
These people are such authoritarians, ladies and gentlemen.

1375
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:06,900
Big business has discovered the preparedness market and that makes it difficult to know

1376
01:51:06,900 --> 01:51:09,120
where to go and who to trust.

1389
01:51:59,160 --> 01:52:04,280
Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the bestselling book, Cancer Step Outside the

1390
01:52:04,280 --> 01:52:05,280
Box.

1391
01:52:05,280 --> 01:52:08,240
I want you to know some very important information.

1392
01:52:08,240 --> 01:52:13,040
In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White

1393
01:52:13,040 --> 01:52:17,360
House at a time when only the President could obtain its world class healer.

1394
01:52:17,360 --> 01:52:22,920
Now 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.

1395
01:52:22,920 --> 01:52:28,000
Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of super bugs with 17 naturally

1396
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:33,140
occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single

1397
01:52:33,140 --> 01:52:34,280
normal cell.

1398
01:52:34,280 --> 01:52:37,960
If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune

1399
01:52:37,960 --> 01:52:42,040
cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.

1400
01:52:42,040 --> 01:52:49,960
Call 1-866-VENUSFLY or order from Carnivora.com, that's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A dot com.

1401
01:52:49,960 --> 01:52:57,320
That's 1-866-836-8735, 1-866-VENUSFLY or visit Carnivora.com.

1402
01:52:57,320 --> 01:53:00,120
Protect your immune system, it's the only one you've got.

1403
01:53:00,120 --> 01:53:04,400
Weakened by GMOs, stressed out about money and blasted by the electric environment.

1404
01:53:04,400 --> 01:53:09,240
Hi, I'm Pastor Ginny and that was the state I was in back in 2010.

1405
01:53:09,240 --> 01:53:11,240
Then I learned about RNA drops.

1406
01:53:11,240 --> 01:53:16,920
I learned that 97% of my DNA that scientists have called junk is actually packed with millions

1407
01:53:16,920 --> 01:53:21,680
of gene switches that play a critical role in controlling how my cells, organs and other

1408
01:53:21,680 --> 01:53:22,840
tissues behave.

1409
01:53:22,840 --> 01:53:26,840
I learned I don't have to put up with disease decay or decline like I've been conditioned

1410
01:53:26,840 --> 01:53:27,840
to believe.

1411
01:53:27,840 --> 01:53:33,640
I began taking RNA drops, a 100% natural formula designed to turn on those switches and provide

1412
01:53:33,640 --> 01:53:35,800
me with amazing health and joy.

1417
01:54:08,520 --> 01:54:14,720
We've got an extremely powerful video piece we did to counter Mayor Bloomberg's piece

1418
01:54:14,720 --> 01:54:19,120
with all the different actors saying turn your guns in.

1419
01:54:19,120 --> 01:54:23,400
One of our listeners, again, I'm proud that our listeners are so active, put out a video

1420
01:54:23,400 --> 01:54:27,780
showing how each actor in there is in these movies involved in gratuitous mass murder

1421
01:54:27,780 --> 01:54:30,240
and shooting.

1422
01:54:30,240 --> 01:54:33,720
Which then anti-gunners who aren't even gun owners, cuz there's not just the predatory

1423
01:54:33,720 --> 01:54:37,480
anti-gunners who know they wanna disarm us and make us slaves.

1424
01:54:37,480 --> 01:54:42,320
There's folks who've never had guns and they think of guns like Hollywood that every time

1425
01:54:42,320 --> 01:54:47,320
a gun's out somebody's oozing someone and they're real scared of them.

1426
01:54:47,320 --> 01:54:49,920
And Hollywood helps do that.

1427
01:54:49,920 --> 01:54:53,740
And one of our listeners put out a video that's had millions of views cuz DrudgeReport.com

1428
01:54:53,740 --> 01:54:57,440
linked to it and then Fox News picked it up and all these other channels.

1429
01:54:57,440 --> 01:55:03,140
That's what I keep telling listeners, I'm nobody special folks and I've reached 15 million

1430
01:55:03,140 --> 01:55:06,540
people a week now one way or another, okay?

1431
01:55:06,540 --> 01:55:10,160
People like Dr. Corsi, who's well researched and smart, he reaches millions every week

1432
01:55:10,160 --> 01:55:12,680
in interviews and his books.

1433
01:55:12,680 --> 01:55:17,080
One of our listeners, cuz I went to his channel and saw that he listens to the show and some

1434
01:55:17,080 --> 01:55:22,920
of his videos, went and did something that's been seen by tens of millions now.

1435
01:55:22,920 --> 01:55:26,880
And we're gonna put a video out that hopefully will get seen by millions that really counters

1436
01:55:26,880 --> 01:55:28,140
Bloomberg.

1437
01:55:28,140 --> 01:55:30,040
It's up to you though.

1438
01:55:30,040 --> 01:55:34,120
And just thank God for Drudge, listen, I gotta say something Dr. Corsi, I'm not just kissing

1439
01:55:34,120 --> 01:55:37,040
the rumpus of DrudgeReport.com.

1440
01:55:37,040 --> 01:55:44,560
I've been tracking it, and more and more, it's WorldNet daily, it's Infowars, but we're

1441
01:55:44,560 --> 01:55:50,560
like Junior when it comes to really just every time Drudge is able to take our information

1442
01:55:50,560 --> 01:55:54,720
and others and his research and really force it out there.

1443
01:55:54,720 --> 01:55:59,280
And I see the system always demonizing Drudge, because they don't like it.

1444
01:55:59,280 --> 01:56:05,440
And I think it's a tale and an example, an allegory of the fact that we can win.

1445
01:56:05,440 --> 01:56:09,880
If we get aggressive now, so let me ask you solutions in this segment and five and in

1446
01:56:09,880 --> 01:56:11,760
the next hour, I know you've got to go.

1447
01:56:11,760 --> 01:56:14,780
What can we do to really beat these people?

1448
01:56:14,780 --> 01:56:20,340
Because even a lot of folks don't like socialism, but their jobs have been shipped overseas,

1449
01:56:20,340 --> 01:56:22,340
they're disabled.

1450
01:56:22,340 --> 01:56:26,400
And Obama's gonna give them money until he fully takes over, then he's gonna euthanize

1451
01:56:26,400 --> 01:56:27,400
you.

1452
01:56:27,400 --> 01:56:28,640
What can we do as solutions, Dr. Corsi?

1453
01:56:28,640 --> 01:56:34,240
Well, I think first of all, you're right about Drudge, Drudge is doing yeoman's work, and

1454
01:56:34,240 --> 01:56:36,240
so are you, Alex.

1455
01:56:36,240 --> 01:56:41,280
We're in the battle, we're doing it every day as well at WND.

1456
01:56:41,280 --> 01:56:47,600
The weapon we've got is the truth, and we've got to keep developing and presenting the

1457
01:56:47,600 --> 01:56:49,720
truth to the American people.

1458
01:56:49,720 --> 01:56:54,520
We've got the advantages of being able to communicate with millions of people through

1459
01:56:54,520 --> 01:56:59,800
the internet, we've got the ability to get the word out, and people are reading and paying

1460
01:56:59,800 --> 01:57:00,800
attention.

1461
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:05,960
In the next few years, we're gonna have to learn how to even use social media more effectively,

1462
01:57:05,960 --> 01:57:11,880
how to use all these techniques of reaching people one by one in their homes, knowing

1463
01:57:11,880 --> 01:57:14,080
who our listeners are.

1464
01:57:14,080 --> 01:57:19,320
There's great advances coming, and the ability, I believe, to technologically reach people

1465
01:57:19,320 --> 01:57:23,960
and communicate with people individually, but in large numbers.

1466
01:57:23,960 --> 01:57:28,880
But the advantage we've got is the truth, and I think if we keep going back to it, I

1467
01:57:28,880 --> 01:57:33,400
mean, every one of the articles I write, Alex, I footnote, I've got all kinds, you can go

1468
01:57:33,400 --> 01:57:35,320
look at the original sources.

1469
01:57:35,320 --> 01:57:39,920
That's what made the Articles of the North American Union, going back to when I was writing

1470
01:57:39,920 --> 01:57:47,080
the late, great USA in 2005, 2006, so powerful, was I linked to their own documents, the government's

1471
01:57:47,080 --> 01:57:48,080
own documents.

1472
01:57:48,080 --> 01:57:54,680
If you look at the article I have on Bernanke increasing our debt, I linked to the Federal

1473
01:57:54,680 --> 01:57:59,640
Reserve minutes in which that is announced, which is a document that's boring, most people

1474
01:57:59,640 --> 01:58:04,640
don't want to read it, but when you see it, it's startling, because there, the Federal

1475
01:58:04,640 --> 01:58:12,040
Reserve is telling you they're going to buy $85 billion a month, it's staggering.

1476
01:58:12,040 --> 01:58:18,200
It's like, we're going to buy a trillion dollars of our own debt, and as if that's, you know,

1477
01:58:18,200 --> 01:58:23,160
buying your own debt is like having a, you know, a printing press in your basement, so

1478
01:58:23,160 --> 01:58:26,560
checks come in, don't worry about it, we'll just keep printing money and send out, pay

1479
01:58:26,560 --> 01:58:27,560
the bills.

1480
01:58:27,560 --> 01:58:32,240
Well, it's a globalist, they get real goods for that, and then we get handed the debt

1481
01:58:32,240 --> 01:58:34,240
when most of its derivatives stay there.

1482
01:58:34,240 --> 01:58:37,680
Again, we're bailing the bankers out, we're going to do five more minutes, I want to hear

1483
01:58:37,680 --> 01:58:38,680
more solutions.

02:00:11,440 --> 02:00:13,560
Well, so does he.

1501
02:00:13,560 --> 02:00:23,480
He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.

1502
02:00:23,480 --> 02:00:24,480
What is your own course?

1503
02:00:24,480 --> 02:00:25,480
He's got to leave in about four or five minutes.

1504
02:00:25,480 --> 02:00:29,480
He's got another interview coming up and again, I've been covering the whole field here, throwing

1505
02:00:29,480 --> 02:00:34,280
stuff at him, but finishing up with solutions.

1506
02:00:34,280 --> 02:00:40,720
I guess the solution is the truth, as you said, and knowing what their plans are.

1507
02:00:40,720 --> 02:00:41,720
Bankrupting America.

1508
02:00:41,720 --> 02:00:44,080
How do you expect things to go?

1509
02:00:44,080 --> 02:00:50,240
Sure people are waking up, but the power structure is accelerating things in your gut.

1510
02:00:50,240 --> 02:00:54,760
How do you see things ending and in your gut, are you the most concerned you've ever been?

1511
02:00:54,760 --> 02:00:58,000
I'm the most concerned I've ever been.

1512
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:05,720
And we're going to have a series of crises that are produced that the only solution offered

1513
02:01:05,720 --> 02:01:12,520
is more government control by both parties, Democrats and Republicans alike.

1514
02:01:12,520 --> 02:01:17,840
This is where the Tea Party has got to recognize that the Republican Party is not necessarily

1515
02:01:17,840 --> 02:01:21,920
a natural home for a conservative movement.

1516
02:01:21,920 --> 02:01:27,400
It's not only exposing the truth, which we've got to do, but it's exposing the hypocrisy

1517
02:01:27,400 --> 02:01:30,560
of the socialists, the communists, the Obamas.

1518
02:01:30,560 --> 02:01:35,040
Obama lives, he's talking about the rich don't pay their fair share.

1519
02:01:35,040 --> 02:01:41,920
Well, Obama's living a life that would make most kings and queens in history pale in comparison

1520
02:01:41,920 --> 02:01:44,560
to the privileges he gives himself and his family.

1521
02:01:44,560 --> 02:01:46,360
We've got to expose this.

1522
02:01:46,360 --> 02:01:51,280
Michael Moore does not live a carbon efficient life.

1523
02:01:51,280 --> 02:01:52,280
None of these people.

1524
02:01:52,280 --> 02:01:59,800
Michael Moore is protected by weapons as is Nancy Pelosi, as is Senator Feinstein and

1525
02:01:59,800 --> 02:02:01,360
Chuck Schumer.

1526
02:02:01,360 --> 02:02:05,120
All these people go into a federal building to work all day where you go through a metal

1527
02:02:05,120 --> 02:02:10,360
detector and there's guards all over the place to protect them.

1528
02:02:10,360 --> 02:02:17,200
The hypocrisy is what exposes the New World Order, the lies and the hypocrisy.

1529
02:02:17,200 --> 02:02:22,880
The crises are what I'm concerned about because the capability of producing, people got to

1530
02:02:22,880 --> 02:02:28,360
understand this power pivot theory, that the engineered bankruptcy that we're in, this

1531
02:02:28,360 --> 02:02:32,120
expansion of the entitlement programs is a plan.

1532
02:02:32,120 --> 02:02:36,200
It's a plan to cause capitalism to crumble so people will give up freedom.

1533
02:02:36,200 --> 02:02:41,760
And then they blame capitalism when we've left capitalism and this is crony fascist

1534
02:02:41,760 --> 02:02:43,080
socialism.

1535
02:02:43,080 --> 02:02:44,880
Removal of God from everywhere.

1536
02:02:44,880 --> 02:02:47,040
This is a major theme.

1537
02:02:47,040 --> 02:02:53,080
The school in which the kid who's on, you know, psychiatrically prescribed drugs, playing

1538
02:02:53,080 --> 02:02:56,760
all day video games at his home, comes into that school.

1539
02:02:56,760 --> 02:03:00,400
You couldn't even use the word God in that school without being arrested.

1540
02:03:00,400 --> 02:03:04,720
But then Obama would pray once it came time, they still give us the old thing every once

1541
02:03:04,720 --> 02:03:08,320
in a while like it's a treat they give us to then punch our buttons.

1542
02:03:08,320 --> 02:03:11,600
It's all masterfully done and you get back to that.

1543
02:03:11,600 --> 02:03:14,120
When you remove God, the devil comes in.

1544
02:03:14,120 --> 02:03:18,280
You know, it's funny all these killers, they're not atheists, they're devil worshipers.

1545
02:03:18,280 --> 02:03:24,280
Play the God theme like music on, you know, in Oregon to get our emotions going.

1546
02:03:24,280 --> 02:03:27,560
So we say, oh, isn't it horrible, we've got to get the guns out of the schools.

1547
02:03:27,560 --> 02:03:31,800
No, you've got to get armed guards in the schools.

1548
02:03:31,800 --> 02:03:33,400
You got to get these kids.

1549
02:03:33,400 --> 02:03:37,860
So the teachers in the teachers union who don't want to spend any time dealing with

1550
02:03:37,860 --> 02:03:43,040
problem children, can't just send them off to a psychiatrist and give them Ritalin or

1551
02:03:43,040 --> 02:03:44,320
Prozac or some other-

1552
02:03:44,320 --> 02:03:48,920
Well, look, I'll say this, it'd be better to put kids in a boot camp to get their butts

1553
02:03:48,920 --> 02:03:54,160
kicked than assault them with Prozac and Ritalin that literally destroys their hearts and brains

1554
02:03:54,160 --> 02:03:55,160
and organs.

1555
02:03:55,160 --> 02:03:56,580
And again, that's the problem.

1556
02:03:56,580 --> 02:04:00,320
When I did stuff wrong, I got my butt whipped, the coaches whipped my butt, they'd make me

1557
02:04:00,320 --> 02:04:01,840
run till I threw up.

1558
02:04:01,840 --> 02:04:04,480
And thank God they did, or I'd have probably been in prison.

1559
02:04:04,480 --> 02:04:05,480
These kids need discipline.

1560
02:04:05,480 --> 02:04:10,320
And the social engineers, Dr. Spock and all them, they bragged, they knew, they knew what

1561
02:04:10,320 --> 02:04:11,720
they were doing.

1562
02:04:11,720 --> 02:04:13,560
They knew exactly what they're doing.

1563
02:04:13,560 --> 02:04:20,200
This is no longer freedom, it's no longer producing character, it's about control.

1564
02:04:20,200 --> 02:04:21,200
Producing control.

1565
02:04:21,200 --> 02:04:27,000
So those in power, the teachers union, the socialists running the Democratic Party, they

1566
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:28,200
control everyone.

1567
02:04:28,200 --> 02:04:34,200
And whenever they want more control or more power, they create a crisis, a bunch of people

1568
02:04:34,200 --> 02:04:40,400
are killed, people are starving, they bring out God, roll out God for 20 minutes.

1569
02:04:40,400 --> 02:04:43,720
Barack Obama's not gonna let God be on the horizon.

1570
02:04:43,720 --> 02:04:45,800
Watch how many times he refers to God in the second inaugural.

1571
02:04:45,800 --> 02:04:48,200
No, he says we are not a Christian nation.

1572
02:04:48,200 --> 02:04:49,480
God bless you, sir.

1573
02:04:49,480 --> 02:04:51,520
We'll talk to you again soon.

1574
02:04:51,520 --> 02:04:53,200
The battle for the republic is now.

1575
02:04:53,200 --> 02:04:54,520
Thank you, Dr. Corsi.

1576
02:04:54,520 --> 02:04:55,520
Thank you, Alex.

1577
02:04:55,520 --> 02:04:56,520
Keep up the fight.

1578
02:04:56,520 --> 02:04:57,520
I will, sir.

1579
02:04:57,520 --> 02:05:00,920
We'll be back with masses of key information.

1580
02:05:00,920 --> 02:05:03,960
Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.

1581
02:05:03,960 --> 02:05:08,960
The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.

1582
02:05:08,960 --> 02:05:15,000
The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce

1583
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:16,000
to the global takeover.

1584
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:22,000
That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at infowarshop.com.

1598
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:05,460
Millions of people are going to get sick this winter from colds, flu and other illnesses.

1599
02:06:05,460 --> 02:06:06,840
Don't be one of them.

1600
02:06:06,840 --> 02:06:11,520

02:06:12,520 --> 02:06:16,340

02:06:31,800 --> 02:06:33,200
harmful pathogens.

1608
02:06:33,200 --> 02:06:38,080
This new technology has the ability to terminate entire colonies of harmful bacteria at several

02:06:38,080 --> 02:06:42,200
hundred times the effectiveness of colloidal or ionic silver solutions.

1610
02:06:42,200 --> 02:06:45,880
The Science Digest Journal says silver is our mightiest germ fighter.

1611

We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.

1632
02:08:08,880 --> 02:08:20,320
You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.

1633
02:08:20,320 --> 02:08:26,360
Alright we've had listeners begging for this more than anything I've probably ever seen

1634
02:08:26,360 --> 02:08:33,080
and because I know at a sick level it's entertaining but it's also revealing and the incredible

1635
02:08:33,080 --> 02:08:37,560
thing is we sit here and talk about them and then they still call in but some of them have

1636
02:08:37,560 --> 02:08:39,040
a halfway valid point.

1637
02:08:39,040 --> 02:08:41,680
They go, look, I don't like Mitt Romney.

1638
02:08:41,680 --> 02:08:42,680
I know he's evil.

1639
02:08:42,680 --> 02:08:43,680
I know Obama's evil.

1640
02:08:43,680 --> 02:08:50,040
He's a lesser of two evils but those are people that have, in my view, a fallacy in their

1641
02:08:50,040 --> 02:08:55,120
understanding and they don't understand what we're saying but when you get real Obama supporters

1642
02:08:55,120 --> 02:09:01,800
calling in, they say you're racist, you're bad, basically the talking points but they

1643
02:09:01,800 --> 02:09:02,800
really believe it.

1644
02:09:02,800 --> 02:09:06,480
I mean, they're freaked out, they're mad, they think I'm trying to keep them from some

1645
02:09:06,480 --> 02:09:13,280
wonderful world under collectivism under the eugenicist because this isn't just collectivism.

1646
02:09:13,280 --> 02:09:19,080
It's eugenics run collectivism but see all collectivism in the last 200 years has been

1647
02:09:19,080 --> 02:09:24,680
eugenics run because the British government ran this big empire and they made a big study

1648
02:09:24,680 --> 02:09:28,000
on record with a whole bunch of different scientists.

1649
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:32,720
That's why all the major sciences came out of eugenics the last 160 years.

1650
02:09:32,720 --> 02:09:33,960
We cover this in the film Endgame.

1651
02:09:33,960 --> 02:09:38,280
It's free online, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement and it's the key to understanding

1652
02:09:38,280 --> 02:09:46,040
what's happening that they wanted to domesticate people and basically create a false reality.

1653
02:09:46,040 --> 02:09:51,000
Create an artificial system where you can't think outside that box and never escape because

1654
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:55,640
they want that control box so they can reduce your numbers and people say, well, they haven't

1655
02:09:55,640 --> 02:09:57,400
done a very good job of it.

1656
02:09:57,400 --> 02:10:04,480
There are different paths and different forces in the world.

1657
02:10:04,480 --> 02:10:06,480
That's the thing, the globalist aren't all powerful.

1658
02:10:06,480 --> 02:10:12,600
They will be if they get that global technocracy in place, which they're really pushing for.

1659
02:10:12,600 --> 02:10:15,500
They could easily fail, they failed before.

1660
02:10:15,500 --> 02:10:19,940
They admit they're behind, that's why they're working so hard right now.

1661
02:10:19,940 --> 02:10:22,700
And some of you will go, well, there are too many people, have you seen how dumb the general

1662
02:10:22,700 --> 02:10:23,700
public is?

1663
02:10:23,700 --> 02:10:25,760
Okay, but you need to understand something.

1664
02:10:25,760 --> 02:10:28,520
Yes, there's truth to some of the eugenics argument.

1665
02:10:28,520 --> 02:10:31,920
And I've never really talked about this on air, this is such a complex issue and I wanna

1666
02:10:31,920 --> 02:10:33,920
make a whole film about it.

1667
02:10:33,920 --> 02:10:40,520
But when you really look at it, they've been there sabotaging things all the way, doing

1668
02:10:40,520 --> 02:10:53,660
things that actually increase the population and increased the population's systems, forms

1669
02:10:53,660 --> 02:10:59,040
of their systems to where it was more destructive on the environment.

1670
02:10:59,040 --> 02:11:00,040
It's incredibly complex.

1671
02:11:00,040 --> 02:11:06,520
I shouldn't even have gotten off into all this because the point is, they're trying

1672
02:11:06,520 --> 02:11:12,380
to dumb people down and they want more dumb people than smart people until they get control

1673
02:11:12,380 --> 02:11:15,400
and then they're gonna wipe almost everybody out.

1674
02:11:15,400 --> 02:11:16,680
It's all divide and conquer.

1675
02:11:16,680 --> 02:11:21,540
It's all play nation states off against each other, races, religions off against each other.

1676
02:11:21,540 --> 02:11:24,240
It's all a destabilization program.

1677
02:11:24,240 --> 02:11:26,280
I forgot to get Corsi's take on Benghazi.

1678
02:11:26,280 --> 02:11:29,640
We sent him back up next week for 30 minutes just on Benghazi.

1679
02:11:29,640 --> 02:11:31,080
I forgot to get to that.

1680
02:11:31,080 --> 02:11:38,400
The point is, is that it all goes back to eugenics and the government is attacking and

1681
02:11:38,400 --> 02:11:40,640
going after smart people.

1682
02:11:40,640 --> 02:11:47,720
You have to understand that eugenics is sold to yuppies and to intelligentsia like, hey,

1683
02:11:47,720 --> 02:11:50,480
there's too many dumb people and they cost too much money.

1684
02:11:50,480 --> 02:11:53,360
Let's go ahead and abort all their kids and get rid of them.

1685
02:11:53,360 --> 02:11:55,320
It's the humane thing to do.

1686
02:11:55,320 --> 02:11:57,200
Let's tell people we're liberals, we're really eugenicists.

1687
02:11:57,200 --> 02:11:58,360
Okay, we'll do that.

1688
02:11:58,360 --> 02:12:02,440
No, I understand, act non-threatening, exactly, sneak up on them.

1689
02:12:02,440 --> 02:12:04,360
All right, let's do that.

1690
02:12:04,360 --> 02:12:10,440
Meanwhile, the entire system, as if that isn't bad enough, is really targeted at smart people

1691
02:12:10,440 --> 02:12:15,360
who aren't part of the power structure or a surplus of smart people.

1692
02:12:15,360 --> 02:12:22,600
Or a surplus of aggressive people who they use to project their force, but who they fear.

1693
02:12:22,600 --> 02:12:28,680
So like a cannon after a war, they decommission and spike and cut up into pieces and melt

1694
02:12:28,680 --> 02:12:29,680
down.

1695
02:12:29,680 --> 02:12:32,520
They do that to our military after they've used you, and now they're just going towards

1696
02:12:32,520 --> 02:12:36,280
robots and drones where you're not even needed.

1697
02:12:36,280 --> 02:12:41,000
And then they write books to the heads of the big computer companies, write books and

1698
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:44,160
articles in Wired Magazine how they're doing it to you.

1699
02:12:44,160 --> 02:12:48,000
I mean, it's not my opinion is what's frustrating about this.

1700
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:53,000
I would have rather gone in the last 100 years, truly industrialized the third world equitably

1701
02:12:53,000 --> 02:13:00,560
to try to build up a system, have technology export that actually built up the first world,

1702
02:13:00,560 --> 02:13:03,600
while empowering the third world.

1703
02:13:03,600 --> 02:13:09,520
Basically no federal welfare, only local welfare, cuz I've studied economic systems at work.

1704
02:13:09,520 --> 02:13:14,920
But those systems create high education, true education, not indoctrination.

1705
02:13:14,920 --> 02:13:20,120
Notice the more education we get, the dumber we get, the more ignorant.

1706
02:13:20,120 --> 02:13:25,480
Again I said I'd take Obama calls and I just go off into a trillion different issues.

1707
02:13:25,480 --> 02:13:27,560
I really want good things for humanity.

1708
02:13:27,560 --> 02:13:29,760
I really have studied history.

1709
02:13:29,760 --> 02:13:34,100
It's not hard, it's not like I have my opinion about what works and they have their opinion

1710
02:13:34,100 --> 02:13:35,100
about what works.

1711
02:13:35,100 --> 02:13:38,000
They don't want collectivism to empower you.

1712
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:43,200
They want collectivism so they have you under their control paying your electric bill and

1713
02:13:43,200 --> 02:13:50,840
paying for your tiny house, your agenda 21 jail cell, so that they can dictate you're

1714
02:13:50,840 --> 02:13:56,000
gonna take shots that are gonna actuary when you die to kill you early.

1715
02:13:56,000 --> 02:14:02,800
And so they can fully control your life and use you and expend you as a cog because they

1716
02:14:02,800 --> 02:14:06,220
are a religion, the priest of power.

1717
02:14:06,220 --> 02:14:13,060
Their whole religion is about organizing groups of people.

1718
02:14:13,060 --> 02:14:16,760
And I don't like it, and I don't like them.

1719
02:14:16,760 --> 02:14:23,080
I mean these globalists are very, very sick people and it is the ultimate sin in the British

1720
02:14:23,080 --> 02:14:24,560
Commission on Population.

1721
02:14:24,560 --> 02:14:30,040
I'm gonna give the number out only for Obama supporters here in a moment and call in on

1722
02:14:30,040 --> 02:14:37,320
their Obama phones.

1723
02:14:37,320 --> 02:14:39,880
I'll just go ahead and give the number out now cuz I'll keep pontificating and the whole

1724
02:14:39,880 --> 02:14:40,880
hour will go by.

1725
02:14:40,880 --> 02:14:43,760
I got a bunch of news to get to and some incredible videos we're gonna premiere.

1726
02:14:43,760 --> 02:14:45,120
One of them is absolutely amazing.

1727
02:14:45,120 --> 02:14:48,460
I hope you're a prisonplanet.tv viewer, but for radio listeners, it'll be posted later

1728
02:14:48,460 --> 02:14:53,200
this afternoon at mfallwars.com and prisonplanet.com, I wanna get it out to everybody.

1729
02:14:53,200 --> 02:15:01,040
It's gonna be the featured video on the YouTube channel and it'll be in HD at prisonplanet.tv.

1730
02:15:01,040 --> 02:15:07,360
How am I gonna save the fluoride heads that have probably had 150 shots in their life?

1731
02:15:07,360 --> 02:15:11,640
Let's say an average 30-year-old inner city woman, black, white, Hispanic, probably had

1732
02:15:11,640 --> 02:15:15,920
150 shots on average, been drinking higher levels of fluoride.

1733
02:15:15,920 --> 02:15:19,360
They've done national studies where in the minority areas it's a lot higher cuz they're

1734
02:15:19,360 --> 02:15:21,400
putting it even higher in your area.

1735
02:15:21,400 --> 02:15:23,840
And that's how actuated out this is, folks.

1736
02:15:23,840 --> 02:15:27,360
And the people in the water district don't ask questions, they're just told to distribute

1737
02:15:27,360 --> 02:15:28,360
it this way.

1738
02:15:28,360 --> 02:15:31,280
That's why some have blown the whistle.

1739
02:15:31,280 --> 02:15:36,800
See, I was able five years ago to start beating the drum about how they're adding radioactive

1740
02:15:36,800 --> 02:15:42,200
isotopes in the so-called sodium fluoride from the phosphate mines.

1741
02:15:42,200 --> 02:15:45,380
It's toxic waste they'd have to store, so they make you pay for it.

1742
02:15:45,380 --> 02:15:48,480
Some cities, millions a year, like Austin.

1743
02:15:48,480 --> 02:15:52,300
And I knew in the studies that the stuff they buy out of Florida, the stuff they buy out

1744
02:15:52,300 --> 02:16:02,080
of Colorado, the stuff they buy out of Mongolia, China, is full of five or six different radioactive

1745
02:16:02,080 --> 02:16:03,080
isotopes.

1746
02:16:03,080 --> 02:16:11,760
I mean, you want kidney cancer, you want bladder cancer, baby, get ready.

1747
02:16:11,760 --> 02:16:15,220
I mean, in some studies, it gives you over 50 times chance of getting, and that's why

1748
02:16:15,220 --> 02:16:16,360
that's all off the chart.

1749
02:16:16,360 --> 02:16:19,880
So I just get up here, did reports, talked about it, read the ingredients.

1750
02:16:19,880 --> 02:16:24,280
Took me probably 30, 40 times talking about it to get suddenly local newscasts all over

1751
02:16:24,280 --> 02:16:25,280
the country.

1752
02:16:25,280 --> 02:16:26,280
You can look these up.

1753
02:16:26,280 --> 02:16:30,720
Would go and would stick a Geiger counter up against the pipes, and they would just

1754
02:16:30,720 --> 02:16:32,000
go off the chart.

1755
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:36,260
And the government spun it, it must be radiation in the aquifer, which is true.

1756
02:16:36,260 --> 02:16:42,360
They're mining limestone for phosphates, where they then take the toxic waste derivative

1757
02:16:42,360 --> 02:16:43,740
and put it in our water.

1758
02:16:43,740 --> 02:16:47,640
It's the same thing that's in some of the aquifers, but in very low levels.

1759
02:16:47,640 --> 02:16:53,520
So see, their spin, I tried my hardest to make sure you wouldn't get killed, but I can't,

1760
02:16:53,520 --> 02:16:55,240
I can't help you.

1761
02:16:55,240 --> 02:16:57,300
Because they're just gonna hit you with a disinfo off.

1762
02:16:57,300 --> 02:17:00,360
The feds all come in, it turned out Rick Perry made it secret.

1763
02:17:00,360 --> 02:17:06,600
As soon as I started exposing it, signed an executive order, in fact, it was an executive

1764
02:17:06,600 --> 02:17:10,880
directive to keep the findings, cuz the state started investigating when I talked about

1765
02:17:10,880 --> 02:17:11,880
it.

1766
02:17:11,880 --> 02:17:15,160
They put an order on it, blocking it out, then folks blew the whistle inside.

1767
02:17:15,160 --> 02:17:19,860
See, there are good people in government corporations, they just don't have intelligence.

1768
02:17:19,860 --> 02:17:24,960
And by intelligence, I don't mean native electrochemical intelligence in their cerebral cortex.

1769
02:17:24,960 --> 02:17:27,060
I mean, they don't know.

1770
02:17:27,060 --> 02:17:29,720
They would never give people radioactive isotopes.

1771
02:17:29,720 --> 02:17:31,720
So they hear me, they go, this guy's crazy.

1772
02:17:31,720 --> 02:17:36,940
They go stick a Geiger counter up to it and to a bag of fluoride coming in out of China.

1773
02:17:36,940 --> 02:17:41,400
And it's 20, 30, 40, 50, 100 times.

1774
02:17:41,400 --> 02:17:43,680
I mean, it's pegging the meters.

1775
02:17:43,680 --> 02:17:48,140
It's Chernobyl.

1776
02:17:48,140 --> 02:17:51,640
And now you see the newscast, yeah, our water's radioactive in Austin.

1777
02:17:51,640 --> 02:17:52,640
We don't know why.

1778
02:17:52,640 --> 02:17:53,640
Don't worry about it.

1779
02:17:53,640 --> 02:17:54,640
Our water, all outside Austin.

1780
02:17:54,640 --> 02:17:56,280
So it's radioactive in Houston.

1781
02:17:56,280 --> 02:17:58,360
It's radioactive in San Antonio.

1782
02:17:58,360 --> 02:18:01,560
All over the country, radioactive, even when you're not even getting it from aquifers.

1783
02:18:01,560 --> 02:18:03,080
They're like, well, how is this happening?

1784
02:18:03,080 --> 02:18:04,500
We're getting it out of a lake.

1785
02:18:04,500 --> 02:18:06,280
They're adding it.

1786
02:18:06,280 --> 02:18:07,280
They're adding it.

1787
02:18:07,280 --> 02:18:08,840
And it's on record, they're adding it.

1788
02:18:08,840 --> 02:18:13,680
I mean, if a cop pulls me over for no reason, if I said they're putting radiation in your

1789
02:18:13,680 --> 02:18:16,640
water, he'll go, I don't care, here's the ticket.

1790
02:18:16,640 --> 02:18:20,200
I mean, it's like, how do you, and it's the same thing with Obama supporters.

1791
02:18:20,200 --> 02:18:22,040
I get up here and criticize Obama.

1792
02:18:22,040 --> 02:18:24,200
They think I'm saying I'm for Mitt Romney.

1793
02:18:24,200 --> 02:18:29,080
No, the fix was in like a Don King boxing match, that that's the winner.

1794
02:18:29,080 --> 02:18:30,120
That's the puppet.

1795
02:18:30,120 --> 02:18:31,120
That's the guy.

1796
02:18:31,120 --> 02:18:32,120
That's what he's gonna do.

1797
02:18:32,120 --> 02:18:36,720
But then they still tear down liberty by having Romney claim he's for good things.

1798
02:18:36,720 --> 02:18:42,400
So that can be discredited through fraud, so he won't defend it.

1799
02:18:42,400 --> 02:18:46,240
So see, then it forces you to defend Romney when he's saying, no, small businesses did

1800
02:18:46,240 --> 02:18:47,240
build America.

1801
02:18:47,240 --> 02:18:50,240
But he's still a bad guy, but I'm forced to defend him.

1802
02:18:50,240 --> 02:18:53,200
And then you hear that, you go, you're defending Romney.

1803
02:18:53,200 --> 02:18:57,640
Listen, I'm not defending Romney when I tell you there's radiation being put in your water.

1804
02:18:57,640 --> 02:18:58,640
Radioactive isotopes.

1805
02:18:58,640 --> 02:19:03,480
See, this is what's so crazy about this, is can you grasp that in your brains if you're

1806
02:19:03,480 --> 02:19:07,160
an Obama supporter, or if you're a right winger or whatever?

1807
02:19:07,160 --> 02:19:08,880
Do you understand the fix is in?

1808
02:19:08,880 --> 02:19:11,580
Do you get that through your head?

1809
02:19:11,580 --> 02:19:16,020
The system wants to suck the energy out of you while they get ready to go to the next

1810
02:19:16,020 --> 02:19:18,380
wave robotic system.

1811
02:19:18,380 --> 02:19:20,240
They don't need us anymore.

1812
02:19:20,240 --> 02:19:25,000
They say you used to be cheap, life used to be cheap, now you're a negative.

1813
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:28,800
And Brzezinski in a speech he gave a few months ago, you can pull it up, said, I saw it even

1814
02:19:28,800 --> 02:19:29,800
quoted in the news.

1815
02:19:29,800 --> 02:19:35,080
He said, he said 20 years ago, to paraphrase, we find the exact quote, he goes, it was easier

1816
02:19:35,080 --> 02:19:41,480
to just spend a million dollars or a billion dollars to brainwash people to follow what

1817
02:19:41,480 --> 02:19:42,480
you said.

1818
02:19:42,480 --> 02:19:44,760
Now it's just cheaper to kill them.

1819
02:19:44,760 --> 02:19:51,880
See, this is what I'm trying to get across to you, folks.

1820
02:19:51,880 --> 02:19:52,880
You're under attack.

1821
02:19:52,880 --> 02:19:59,480
800, I'll give the number out when we come back, 800-25-99231, Obama supporters.

1822
02:19:59,480 --> 02:20:07,480
Hello, I'm Alex Jones, myself, my family, the Infowars.com team want to relay to you

1823
02:20:07,480 --> 02:20:12,560
and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalist on every

1824
02:20:12,560 --> 02:20:19,520
front Infowars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats, but we can't do that without

1825
02:20:19,520 --> 02:20:20,520
your help.

1826
02:20:20,520 --> 02:20:25,760
By getting the films, bumper stickers and T-shirts at Infowars.com, you will wake up

1827
02:20:25,760 --> 02:20:31,800
people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.

1828
02:20:31,800 --> 02:20:35,260
We need your help to spread the word like never before.

1829
02:20:35,260 --> 02:20:41,480
They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.

1830
02:20:41,480 --> 02:20:48,920
You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization

1831
02:20:48,920 --> 02:20:50,680
and ultimate extermination.

1832
02:20:50,680 --> 02:20:52,840
The war is here.

1833
02:20:52,840 --> 02:21:00,360
It's an Infowar, the spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.

1834
02:21:00,360 --> 02:21:04,600
Hey there, Frank Bates here.

1835
02:21:04,600 --> 02:21:09,680
Have you heard about the weird device that could wipe out 280 million Americans?

1836
02:21:09,680 --> 02:21:11,720
This is really scary stuff.

1837
02:21:11,720 --> 02:21:16,680
Defense experts warn that this odd device poses the greatest threat we've ever known.

1838
02:21:16,680 --> 02:21:20,960
In fact, just a few weeks ago, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich wrote an op-ed

1839
02:21:20,960 --> 02:21:24,200
piece for the Washington Post warning about this deadly threat.

1840
02:21:24,200 --> 02:21:27,520
I can't believe that more people aren't talking about this.

1841
02:21:27,520 --> 02:21:31,400
It may be because the liberals and the government are trying to cover it up.

1842
02:21:31,400 --> 02:21:37,080
That's why my friend just created a free video at weirddevice.com that exposes this threat

1843
02:21:37,080 --> 02:21:39,880
and blows the doors off the conspiracy.

1844
02:21:39,880 --> 02:21:45,720
Go watch the shocking video at weirddevice.com right now to discover exactly what it is plus

1845
02:21:45,720 --> 02:21:50,160
discover the number one way you and your family can survive this deadly attack.

1846
02:21:50,160 --> 02:21:55,240
I'm not sure how long this video will be online, so go to weirddevice.com before it's gone

1847
02:21:55,240 --> 02:21:56,240
forever.

1848
02:21:56,240 --> 02:22:00,040
Again, that's weirddevice.com.

1849
02:22:00,040 --> 02:22:04,240
On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth

1850
02:22:04,240 --> 02:22:06,760
to retire and live out their golden years.

1851
02:22:06,760 --> 02:22:11,800
Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many

1852
02:22:11,800 --> 02:22:14,820
retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.

1853
02:22:14,820 --> 02:22:19,120
Is this a flaw-free enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing

1854
02:22:19,120 --> 02:22:23,040
us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?

1855
02:22:23,040 --> 02:22:26,800
These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature

1856
02:22:26,800 --> 02:22:28,480
from Jekyll Island.

1857
02:22:28,480 --> 02:22:32,200
Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank

1858
02:22:32,200 --> 02:22:37,240
power, a gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.

1859
02:22:37,240 --> 02:22:38,640
Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

1860
02:22:38,640 --> 02:22:43,360
I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.

1862
02:22:48,160 --> 02:22:51,280
It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

02:22:51,280 --> 02:22:56,040
Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.

That's 1-800-686-2237.

1865
02:22:57,040 --> 02:23:02,840
Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the bestselling book, Cancer Step Outside the

1866
02:23:02,840 --> 02:23:03,840
Box.

1867
02:23:03,840 --> 02:23:06,760
I want you to know some very important information.

1868
02:23:06,760 --> 02:23:11,560
In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White

1869
02:23:11,560 --> 02:23:15,720
House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.

1870
02:23:15,720 --> 02:23:21,120
Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.

1871
02:23:21,120 --> 02:23:26,520
Now, you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally

1872
02:23:26,520 --> 02:23:31,660
occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single

1873
02:23:31,660 --> 02:23:32,800
normal cell.

1874
02:23:32,800 --> 02:23:36,480
If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune

1875
02:23:36,480 --> 02:23:40,560
cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.

1876
02:23:40,560 --> 02:23:48,520
Call 1-866-VenusFly or order from Carnivora.com, that's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A dot com.

1877
02:23:48,520 --> 02:23:55,880
That's 1-866-836-8735, 1-866-VenusFly or visit Carnivora.com.

1878
02:23:55,880 --> 02:23:56,880
Protect your immune system.

1879
02:23:56,880 --> 02:23:58,880
It's the only one you've got.

1880
02:23:58,880 --> 02:24:07,280
Don't worry, this show is documented.

1881
02:24:07,280 --> 02:24:10,800
I'm Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.

1882
02:24:10,800 --> 02:24:18,640
Yeah, if you type in radioactive isotopes found in water supplies, you'll see newscasts

1883
02:24:18,640 --> 02:24:22,200
all over the country.

1884
02:24:22,200 --> 02:24:26,360
And guys also type in, as I mentioned, it's been a while since I've covered this, type

1885
02:24:26,360 --> 02:24:33,920
in Rick Perry covered up radiation water or Rick Perry ordered radiation and water cover

1886
02:24:33,920 --> 02:24:34,920
up.

1887
02:24:34,920 --> 02:24:40,880
And again, my point is we're able to get a story out and go, by the way, they're putting

1888
02:24:40,880 --> 02:24:44,080
radiation and radioactive isotopes in your water.

1889
02:24:44,080 --> 02:24:47,680
We're able to get that out, but then they just give it a cover story.

1890
02:24:47,680 --> 02:24:51,440
I mean, we know where it's coming from and they have all these investigations.

1891
02:24:51,440 --> 02:24:52,440
Where's it coming from?

1892
02:24:52,440 --> 02:24:53,440
Where's it coming from?

1893
02:24:53,440 --> 02:24:57,760
And they've got enough globalist managers out there that no newscast ever said, it's

1894
02:24:57,760 --> 02:25:01,920
in the bag of fluoride right here.

1895
02:25:01,920 --> 02:25:10,440
When it's in government studies and state studies and federal stuff, it's all known.

1896
02:25:10,440 --> 02:25:11,480
And see, that's an example.

1897
02:25:11,480 --> 02:25:16,200
You will take vaccines from government controlled hospitals with a government that's been caught

1898
02:25:16,200 --> 02:25:17,200
testing.

1899
02:25:17,200 --> 02:25:21,360
Everybody knows about syphilis in black people because it was a big deal and came out.

1900
02:25:21,360 --> 02:25:25,360
But there's like thousands of studies, thousands of things like that, black, white, you name

1901
02:25:25,360 --> 02:25:26,360
it.

1902
02:25:26,360 --> 02:25:32,600
I mean, Obama is a globalist New World Order eugenicist.

1903
02:25:32,600 --> 02:25:33,600
They all are.

1904
02:25:33,600 --> 02:25:37,640
The point is they're gonna use the leftist takeover of collectivism to get control of

1905
02:25:37,640 --> 02:25:40,080
you so they can put whatever they want in your body.

1906
02:25:40,080 --> 02:25:46,680
Obama supporters, 800-259-9231, they are feeling good right now.

1907
02:25:46,680 --> 02:25:48,440
They're celebrating everywhere.

1908
02:25:48,440 --> 02:25:49,840
The government's their friend.

1909
02:25:49,840 --> 02:25:51,880
They've got a big ego now.

1910
02:25:51,880 --> 02:25:55,200
They're under the dark wings of the New World Order.

1911
02:25:55,200 --> 02:25:59,120
And let's talk to Mac in New Hampshire who's an Obama supporter.

1912
02:25:59,120 --> 02:26:00,120
Some of these will be sarcastic.

1913
02:26:00,120 --> 02:26:01,120
Go ahead, Mac.

1914
02:26:01,120 --> 02:26:02,120
Hey, why not, Alex?

1915
02:26:02,120 --> 02:26:03,120
I mean, think about it.

1916
02:26:03,120 --> 02:26:12,080
You sell gold for the New World Order, so why can't I support Obama?

1917
02:26:12,080 --> 02:26:14,560
Okay, so I guess that's it.

1918
02:26:14,560 --> 02:26:15,560
I'm convicted.

1919
02:26:15,560 --> 02:26:17,800
I sell gold for the New World Order.

1920
02:26:17,800 --> 02:26:20,560
Who owns all the gold?

1921
02:26:20,560 --> 02:26:22,560
The Rothschilds, right?

1922
02:26:22,560 --> 02:26:29,120
They own a lot of it, but they're trying to drive down the price of it and hoard it.

1923
02:26:29,120 --> 02:26:34,760
They actually, openly, all the big mega banks and people wanna keep gold down, so while

1924
02:26:34,760 --> 02:26:37,840
they buy it, they're always bad mouthing it.

1925
02:26:37,840 --> 02:26:44,400
And I told people buy gold at 260 bucks an ounce, and then it doubled, tripled, quadrupled.

1926
02:26:44,400 --> 02:26:46,240
I personally believe in gold and silver.

1927
02:26:46,240 --> 02:26:51,040
I guess everything I do is bad, so that's why you support Obama.

1928
02:26:51,040 --> 02:26:53,760
I'm not saying everything you do is bad.

1929
02:26:53,760 --> 02:26:57,240
No, no, no, hold on, no, no, no, it's a moral equivalency.

1930
02:26:57,240 --> 02:27:01,560
You're saying I support Obama, I guess cuz you think he gives you something free, I guess

1931
02:27:01,560 --> 02:27:02,560
that's the message.

1932
02:27:02,560 --> 02:27:08,160
And then you're saying I'm immoral, I sell gold when I have a sponsor, Midas Resources

1933
02:27:08,160 --> 02:27:13,040
where I get my gold, who has great deals on it, so that when the fiat currency goes belly

1934
02:27:13,040 --> 02:27:14,200
up, people are prepared.

1935
02:27:14,200 --> 02:27:19,320
See, I sell things I believe in to fund my operation because I try to be a moral person.

1936
02:27:19,320 --> 02:27:24,960
So whatever I think's really hot, like Propure Water Filters discounted at info.store.com

1937
02:27:24,960 --> 02:27:30,200
or Midas Resources, Frank's or whatever, I promote the bullion.

1938
02:27:30,200 --> 02:27:33,880
Even though sponsorship wise, I could make more if I promoted the numismatics, and there

1939
02:27:33,880 --> 02:27:35,280
are some good deals on that.

1940
02:27:35,280 --> 02:27:39,440
It's just hard to really know what you're doing, I promote bullion.

1941
02:27:39,440 --> 02:27:44,360
Even though I have sponsors knocking my doors down to promote numismatics with 200% markups

1942
02:27:44,360 --> 02:27:46,320
that other talk show hosts promote all day.

1943
02:27:46,320 --> 02:27:47,320
Do you hear me do that?

1944
02:27:47,320 --> 02:27:48,320
No, you don't.

1945
02:27:48,320 --> 02:27:51,480
So why do you like Obama?

1946
02:27:51,480 --> 02:27:52,480
We've heard how I'm evil.

1947
02:27:52,480 --> 02:27:53,480
Okay, I'm bad.

1948
02:27:53,480 --> 02:27:57,760
Now, you tell us, you're in charge, aren't you?

1949
02:27:57,760 --> 02:28:00,600
You kind of feel good about this big government right now, don't you?

1950
02:28:00,600 --> 02:28:03,720
Well, I look at it this way.

1951
02:28:03,720 --> 02:28:07,840
One way or the other, I don't care.

1952
02:28:07,840 --> 02:28:12,440
What's Obama gonna do that any other president hasn't done already to us?

1953
02:28:12,440 --> 02:28:13,440
Exactly.

1954
02:28:13,440 --> 02:28:17,520
You're like, I'm old, I'm getting my government money and I'm just gonna laugh at it and that

1955
02:28:17,520 --> 02:28:19,160
gives me power over it.

1956
02:28:19,160 --> 02:28:25,600
Well, I mean, let's face it, every other president, right, has screwed up, am I right?

1957
02:28:25,600 --> 02:28:29,760
No, no, no, since they murdered Kennedy and they were good and bad and he wasn't perfect,

1958
02:28:29,760 --> 02:28:33,880
we've been run by foreign banks, so things are getting progressively worse.

1959
02:28:33,880 --> 02:28:39,140
The president's a puppet, see, I can't get that through to you, we're in a foreign takeover.

1960
02:28:39,140 --> 02:28:40,900
Do you know what they've done in Greece and places?

1961
02:28:40,900 --> 02:28:42,460
They're gonna do that here.

1962
02:28:42,460 --> 02:28:47,280
You understand, you're gonna end up not getting your money or social security down this road.

1963
02:28:47,280 --> 02:28:51,840
Let me ask you this, if you think any president was ever good, right, then how come you never

1964
02:28:51,840 --> 02:28:58,840
mentioned on your radio show that the Constitution was suspended in 1933 and no one's ever re-suspended

1965
02:28:58,840 --> 02:28:59,840
it?

1966
02:28:59,840 --> 02:29:01,320
How come you never mentioned that?

1967
02:29:01,320 --> 02:29:07,000
Well, sir, that's in my films, the Emergency Powers Act of 1933, and that's when they put

1968
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:11,120
us under emergency and that every year they re-enact the emergency and that we've had

1969
02:29:11,120 --> 02:29:16,160
martial law since then as a beachhead and that they've been slowly turning the heat

1970

up.

a seven and a half, I've written articles about it, so I guess you must have missed

1973
02:29:23,400 --> 02:29:24,400
that show.

1974
02:29:24,400 --> 02:29:28,640

02:29:28,640 --> 02:29:29,640
a government?

1976

1978
02:29:40,520 --> 02:29:41,520
support Obama?

1979
02:29:41,520 --> 02:29:42,520
It's not.

1980
02:29:42,520 --> 02:29:48,040
Of course not, he's not gonna do anything more than any other president has ever done.

1981
02:29:48,040 --> 02:29:49,040
Are you kidding?

That is just some of the news.

2039
02:33:59,880 --> 02:34:02,800
I want to go back to the Obama supporters.

2040
02:34:02,800 --> 02:34:04,360
That's what I found.

2041
02:34:04,360 --> 02:34:08,900
They just have an arrogance and he's all right.

2042
02:34:08,900 --> 02:34:11,880
And they like how he talks and they like his baloney.

2043
02:34:11,880 --> 02:34:12,880
Will you queue up?

2044
02:34:12,880 --> 02:34:17,240
I've got to tell you this, the Obama clip where he pledged not to raise taxes on payroll

2045
02:34:17,240 --> 02:34:22,360
taxes or any other taxes on people below a quarter million dollars a year because there's

2046
02:34:22,360 --> 02:34:28,920
like 14 different new taxes, fines, fees, and was covering it yesterday, 14 different

2047
02:34:28,920 --> 02:34:36,640
ones out of the new Congress that he robo signed yesterday.

2048
02:34:36,640 --> 02:34:40,160
And 12 billion in cuts, I mean, that's a joke.

2049
02:34:40,160 --> 02:34:41,480
They want to bankrupt us.

2050
02:34:41,480 --> 02:34:43,440
They're not screwing up in Washington.

2051
02:34:43,440 --> 02:34:47,240
Let's go ahead, I mean, I should have played this for that Obama supporter.

2052
02:34:47,240 --> 02:34:52,440
I mean, do you like being lied to and they go, that's just the way I'll do it.

2053
02:34:52,440 --> 02:34:56,320
Well, why the Democrats get so upset about drones and killing and wars?

2054
02:34:56,320 --> 02:34:57,800
I got upset when Bush was doing it.

2055
02:34:57,800 --> 02:35:03,080
I'm upset now, cuz see, that's being done in my name and my tax money is going to do

2056
02:35:03,080 --> 02:35:04,080
that.

2057
02:35:04,080 --> 02:35:05,080
So I feel responsible.

2058
02:35:05,080 --> 02:35:09,920
So I mean, I feel bad about it.

2059
02:35:09,920 --> 02:35:14,200
I can't control some Prozac head who stole guns from mommy and goes and kills people.

2060
02:35:14,200 --> 02:35:17,600
The folks that put them on the drugs in the schools, the people that push all this and

2061
02:35:17,600 --> 02:35:19,840
know it's gonna happen, I don't like them.

2062
02:35:19,840 --> 02:35:21,420
They're the ones that help this happen.

2063
02:35:21,420 --> 02:35:26,440
But I'm not guilty for Adam Lanza because I want to protect my family and my Second

2064
02:35:26,440 --> 02:35:27,440
Amendment birthright.

2065
02:35:27,440 --> 02:35:33,160
Well, let me tell you something, I do share some of the blame for not doing enough to

2066
02:35:33,160 --> 02:35:34,600
stop these wars and things.

2067
02:35:34,600 --> 02:35:38,720
And then just to watch you Democrats who would get so upset about Bush, cuz it was just moral

2068
02:35:38,720 --> 02:35:40,160
power for you.

2069
02:35:40,160 --> 02:35:42,280
Now when Obama does it, you love it.

2070
02:35:42,280 --> 02:35:43,400
I see him defend it.

2071
02:35:43,400 --> 02:35:47,720
I put a video out showing kids Obama killed with drones and they were like, good, kill

2072
02:35:47,720 --> 02:35:48,720
them.

2073
02:35:48,720 --> 02:35:49,720
They were real Democrats.

2074
02:35:49,720 --> 02:35:50,720
I mean, you're just sick.

2075
02:35:50,720 --> 02:35:56,000
You think you're on a winning team when Obama is a front man for a guy putting fluoride

2076
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:59,360
in your drinking water, putting cancer viruses in your vaccine.

2077
02:35:59,360 --> 02:36:03,120
You're like, I ain't been doing it a long time.

2078
02:36:03,120 --> 02:36:04,920
You are living in fantasy land.

2079
02:36:04,920 --> 02:36:09,160
I'm gonna move quickly here through Obama supporters 80025 at 99231.

2080
02:36:09,160 --> 02:36:11,920
We've got our answer to demand a plan that's gonna premiere here.

2081
02:36:11,920 --> 02:36:16,840
It's pretty powerful, audio and video, and it'll be posted in the next few hours in infowars.com

2082
02:36:16,840 --> 02:36:19,000
for the radio listeners.

2083
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:22,280
Obama supporter listening on 90.1 FM in Austin, go ahead.

2084
02:36:22,280 --> 02:36:24,440
Wait, wait, wait, put them on hold.

2085
02:36:24,440 --> 02:36:28,200
I forgot we have a station owner or manager who wanted to say something about Obama.

2086
02:36:28,200 --> 02:36:29,800
I apologize, I'm out of control.

2087
02:36:29,800 --> 02:36:32,240
I'm doing stuff during the breaks is the problem.

2088
02:36:32,240 --> 02:36:43,720
Greg, I think his name is Lesher, operates 1540 AM, KYAH, yeah, 540, I'm so out of my

2089
02:36:43,720 --> 02:36:46,560
mind folks, operates 540.

2090
02:36:46,560 --> 02:36:47,560
You know what it is?

2091
02:36:47,560 --> 02:36:50,720
We gotta move this TV closer to me with the calls cuz I got good eyes.

2092
02:36:50,720 --> 02:36:55,480
But since we put it on a smaller monitor, I can't read, I mean, my eyes are going.

2093
02:36:55,480 --> 02:36:58,920
I've always had like 2015 vision and I can't read this.

2094
02:36:58,920 --> 02:37:07,800
Again, Greg operates 540 AM, KYAH, another one of our great affiliates across the United

2095
02:37:07,800 --> 02:37:08,800
States.

2096
02:37:08,800 --> 02:37:12,560
Greg, what is your take today, sir, on all this?

2097
02:37:12,560 --> 02:37:15,440
Okay, you're sitting down, I hope.

2098
02:37:15,440 --> 02:37:18,240
I am sitting down, sir.

2099
02:37:18,240 --> 02:37:25,040
Okay, when a forest fire gets going, the best way that they fight it is create a backfire

2100
02:37:25,040 --> 02:37:26,880
so they can burn up all the fuel.

2101
02:37:26,880 --> 02:37:35,280
And they've done that with this birth certificate malarkey, okay?

2102
02:37:35,280 --> 02:37:38,400
It doesn't matter where the man was born.

2103
02:37:38,400 --> 02:37:40,680
He could have been born on the high seas.

2104
02:37:40,680 --> 02:37:42,720
He understands this.

2105
02:37:42,720 --> 02:37:48,080
But in order to qualify to be a candidate for the United States President, or to be

2106
02:37:48,080 --> 02:37:57,200
the President, you have to have natural born citizens, both parents.

2107
02:37:57,200 --> 02:38:05,800
And even according to the United Nations laws, because his father was a British citizen,

2108
02:38:05,800 --> 02:38:08,000
he is a British citizen himself.

2109
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:10,120
Yes, he's a dual citizen.

2110
02:38:10,120 --> 02:38:11,120
I knew that.

2111
02:38:11,120 --> 02:38:12,280
No, actually, I knew that.

2112
02:38:12,280 --> 02:38:13,280
It's never gotten attention.

2113
02:38:13,280 --> 02:38:20,520
And the laws, when he was born, said you had to have both parents be citizens who were

2114
02:38:20,520 --> 02:38:21,520
actually born here.

2115
02:38:21,520 --> 02:38:24,160
They've since, I believe, changed the law going from memory.

2116
02:38:24,160 --> 02:38:28,600
But no, he is illegitimate, and they used the whole thing about where is he really from

2117
02:38:28,600 --> 02:38:29,920
as a distraction.

2118
02:38:29,920 --> 02:38:33,560
Yeah, no, laws are not changed.

2119
02:38:33,560 --> 02:38:37,640
You have to be a natural born citizen, or your parents at least have to be naturalized

2120
02:38:37,640 --> 02:38:39,640
citizens before your- Both of them.

2121
02:38:39,640 --> 02:38:41,480
Yes, both of them.

2122
02:38:41,480 --> 02:38:45,120
It's in the Constitution, okay?

2123
02:38:45,120 --> 02:38:46,120
That's the way it is.

2124
02:38:46,120 --> 02:38:47,120
No, no, you're right.

2125
02:38:47,120 --> 02:38:50,400
But I believe at the time that was the law, and you're right, it's in the Constitution.

2126
02:38:50,400 --> 02:38:53,520
I think they claim they have a law that changed it, but you're right.

2127
02:38:53,520 --> 02:38:54,520
It's in the Constitution.

2128
02:38:54,520 --> 02:38:58,080
You can't do that without a constitutional convention.

2129
02:38:58,080 --> 02:39:03,960
Well, that's why they got this, the artificial birth certificate.

2130
02:39:03,960 --> 02:39:04,960
That's not the issue.

2131
02:39:04,960 --> 02:39:05,960
The issue isn't where he was born.

2132
02:39:05,960 --> 02:39:06,960
It doesn't matter.

2133
02:39:06,960 --> 02:39:11,120
As long as both your parents are citizens, you can be born on a high seas.

2134
02:39:11,120 --> 02:39:13,240
You can be born in space.

2135
02:39:13,240 --> 02:39:16,040
You are a natural born citizen.

2136
02:39:16,040 --> 02:39:21,960
What we're talking about here is a native born, and that has nothing to do with the

2137
02:39:21,960 --> 02:39:22,960
law.

2138
02:39:22,960 --> 02:39:26,360
You have to be a natural born citizen, and here's what's happened.

2139
02:39:26,360 --> 02:39:28,400
He has already served his four years.

2140
02:39:28,400 --> 02:39:36,960
Now, we're in a critical time period, very critical, because tomorrow, Congress sits

2141
02:39:36,960 --> 02:39:40,520
down and they go ahead with the election and accept it.

2142
02:39:40,520 --> 02:39:42,000
Now, here's the deal.

2143
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:49,540
A quo warranto action has been started with the Attorney General, and people need to get

2144
02:39:49,540 --> 02:39:55,800
behind this and get overnight letters to their senators tonight, today, before the post office

2145
02:39:55,800 --> 02:39:57,920
closes.

2146
02:39:57,920 --> 02:40:01,800
What they need to do is they need to go to teamlaw.net.

2147
02:40:01,800 --> 02:40:05,120
There's a news flash, call to action.

2148
02:40:05,120 --> 02:40:06,680
Click on that.

2149
02:40:06,680 --> 02:40:09,800
Read the article.

2150
02:40:09,800 --> 02:40:16,120
We actually did the one who started this quo warranto action, and actually, Eric Madsen

2151
02:40:16,120 --> 02:40:20,880
there at team law has actually quo warrantoed judges numerous times and got them off the

2152
02:40:20,880 --> 02:40:21,880
bench.

2153
02:40:21,880 --> 02:40:22,880
They understand-

2154
02:40:22,880 --> 02:40:23,880
No, no, I'm aware of that.

2155
02:40:23,880 --> 02:40:27,760
And again, John McCain was born on a ship in the Panama Canal, but both his parents

2156
02:40:27,760 --> 02:40:29,600
were known to be US citizens.

2157
02:40:29,600 --> 02:40:31,600
So obviously, he's a citizen.

2158
02:40:31,600 --> 02:40:33,120
It's not where you're born.

2159
02:40:33,120 --> 02:40:39,440
It's that you have parents that are both born in the United States, and it's the same thing.

2160
02:40:39,440 --> 02:40:40,440
And you're right.

2161
02:40:40,440 --> 02:40:41,440
That's been looked into.

2162
02:40:41,440 --> 02:40:46,120
It was part of England when he was born.

2163
02:40:46,120 --> 02:40:50,560
And so his supposed dad, that makes him a British citizen.

2164
02:40:50,560 --> 02:40:57,120
And up till now, nobody's done, they've investigated what has been done, and nothing has been brought

2165
02:40:57,120 --> 02:41:00,940
into the proper venue until now.

2166
02:41:00,940 --> 02:41:06,200
And once this gets started, and once these people send these things to their senators

2167
02:41:06,200 --> 02:41:12,520
in Washington, because that's where they are right now, and overnight them, your listeners,

2168
02:41:12,520 --> 02:41:18,160
we could create truckloads of these, and the attorney general will be flooded with these.

2169
02:41:18,160 --> 02:41:21,160
The attorney general's job is basically done, okay?

2170
02:41:21,160 --> 02:41:28,920
Because even if he refuses to proceed with this, Zane Gray, who started this, becomes

2171
02:41:28,920 --> 02:41:35,280
the special prosecutor for the United States, and then it becomes the United States against

2172
02:41:35,280 --> 02:41:36,280
Barack Obama.

2173
02:41:36,280 --> 02:41:38,440
That's what the court document will read.

2174
02:41:38,440 --> 02:41:42,720
And it will begin the core warrantal action, and there is no way that Obama can get out

2175
02:41:42,720 --> 02:41:47,360
of it, because he cannot argue the fact that he's already said his father was from Kenya.

2176
02:41:47,360 --> 02:41:48,920
He's a Kenyan, okay?

2177
02:41:48,920 --> 02:41:54,600
Well, let me ask you this, are people waking up there in Delta, Utah, to what's going on?

2178
02:41:54,600 --> 02:41:55,600
Oh, absolutely.

2179
02:41:55,600 --> 02:41:57,900
We just had a two-hour program.

2180
02:41:57,900 --> 02:42:01,840
We had Eric Madsen with Team Lawn, and by the way, Eric Madsen will be on with Butch

2181
02:42:01,840 --> 02:42:04,640
Pot tonight on Call to Decision.

2182
02:42:04,640 --> 02:42:07,140
We had a two-hour meeting, and Zane Gray was on there.

2183
02:42:07,140 --> 02:42:08,880
We talked about this in great detail.

2184
02:42:08,880 --> 02:42:13,640
I will actually send you that two-hour program, if you wanna put it on your website, so people

2185
02:42:13,640 --> 02:42:15,400
can listen to this.

2186
02:42:15,400 --> 02:42:18,400
And I mean, it's just fantastic.

2187
02:42:18,400 --> 02:42:20,840
This is the time when we can stop the whole thing.

2188
02:42:20,840 --> 02:42:26,640
We can get this man out of office, because he will be going in there illegally, against

2189
02:42:26,640 --> 02:42:27,640
the Constitution.

2190
02:42:27,640 --> 02:42:28,640
He is not a citizen.

2191
02:42:28,640 --> 02:42:32,960
Well, I'll tell you what, I'll get your name and number.

2192
02:42:32,960 --> 02:42:37,720
We appreciate you carrying the show, and maybe we should get those guys on as well.

2193
02:42:37,720 --> 02:42:39,760
God bless you, and I appreciate you calling in.

2194
02:42:39,760 --> 02:42:43,100
I said I was gonna go to Obama supporters here, but I wanted to hear from one of the

2195
02:42:43,100 --> 02:42:46,080
station owners out there in Utah.

2196
02:42:46,080 --> 02:42:50,600
Now, let's go back to Karen, now in Texas, an Obama supporter.

2197
02:42:50,600 --> 02:42:52,600
Go ahead, ma'am, you're on the air.

2198
02:42:52,600 --> 02:43:01,240
Okay, well, it was the Republicans that put these toll roads into Austin, and we were

2199
02:43:01,240 --> 02:43:03,200
trying to fight that.

2200
02:43:03,200 --> 02:43:10,480
And when I originally voted for Obama, we thought that he would keep us out of a war,

2201
02:43:10,480 --> 02:43:11,480
okay?

2202
02:43:11,480 --> 02:43:16,240
And we thought that maybe he was better than McCain.

2203
02:43:16,240 --> 02:43:19,200
So now he ran against Mitt Romney.

2204
02:43:19,200 --> 02:43:25,920
Well, they wouldn't let us vote for Ron Paul, and we didn't know who else to vote for.

2205
02:43:25,920 --> 02:43:27,400
So what are we supposed to do?

2206
02:43:27,400 --> 02:43:31,240
No, no, see, this is a reasonable Obama supporter calling in.

2207
02:43:31,240 --> 02:43:35,440
No, I get it, the Republicans run horrible people, so you don't have a choice.

2208
02:43:35,440 --> 02:43:41,520
The point is Obama is really, really bad is my point, because he gets away with the wars,

2209
02:43:41,520 --> 02:43:45,080
he gets away with the torture, he gets away with everything.

2210
02:43:45,080 --> 02:43:49,960
And they don't use him to bring people together, they use him to create division, Karen, I

2211
02:43:49,960 --> 02:43:50,960
appreciate your call.

2212
02:43:50,960 --> 02:43:54,280
And look, we get obsessed with personalities.

2213
02:43:54,280 --> 02:44:00,200
My point is that the Obama supporters that cheerlead for Obama and who really think he's

2214
02:44:00,200 --> 02:44:06,040
like a movie star and go, and I'm like, listen, he's really bad, you just lost.

2215
02:44:06,040 --> 02:44:07,720
That's who we're talking about.

2216
02:44:07,720 --> 02:44:12,280
Those are people that are really dangerous because they're so stupid.

2217
02:44:12,280 --> 02:44:15,960
And that's who we're wanting to talk to, I'll be honest with you, we had one earlier.

2218
02:44:15,960 --> 02:44:18,680
Joe in Florida, you're on the air, go ahead.

2219
02:44:18,680 --> 02:44:19,680
Hello?

2220
02:44:19,680 --> 02:44:21,680
Yes, sir, go ahead.

2221
02:44:21,680 --> 02:44:23,560
Sorry about that.

2222
02:44:23,560 --> 02:44:29,800
First things first, I would just like everybody to research an AD psyop created called Mind

2223
02:44:29,800 --> 02:44:34,200
Wars, and how Infowars is a manifestation of that.

2224
02:44:34,200 --> 02:44:37,520
Number two- Now, sir, now, sir, obviously, I use the

2225
02:44:37,520 --> 02:44:44,640
term infowars.com to say the global issues information lies against us, we use truth

2226
02:44:44,640 --> 02:44:45,640
against them.

2227
02:44:45,640 --> 02:44:51,980
See, the word propaganda just means information to get something political done you want.

2228
02:44:51,980 --> 02:44:57,400
Black propaganda means lies, white propaganda means truth, gray propaganda means spin.

2229
02:44:57,400 --> 02:45:03,120
I use white propaganda, so I want to be clear about terms out there.

2230
02:45:03,120 --> 02:45:10,680
When I talk about violence lowering after gun ownership increases, and I have the FBI

2231
02:45:10,680 --> 02:45:12,680
statistics, that's white propaganda.

2232
02:45:12,680 --> 02:45:17,260
Okay, so I want to be specific about that, go ahead.

2233
02:45:17,260 --> 02:45:23,120
I understand that, and the message certainly use the term bear fruits.

2234
02:45:23,120 --> 02:45:27,600
The fruit that is bared from the message is certainly true, but what I'd like to point

2235
02:45:27,600 --> 02:45:29,720
out is that you have to be careful.

2236
02:45:29,720 --> 02:45:35,880
A lot of the times in the entertainment industry especially, 75% of the truth is reported with

2237
02:45:35,880 --> 02:45:38,760
15% careful- Listen, I agree with you, listen, we're taking

2238
02:45:38,760 --> 02:45:43,400
calls from Obama supporters, will you tell us, do you support Obama or was that a way

2239
02:45:43,400 --> 02:45:44,400
to get on the air?

2240
02:45:44,400 --> 02:45:46,600
No, I do have a point about Obama.

2241
02:45:46,600 --> 02:45:51,400
Now, you'd have to be completely unaware of the situation, what's really going on with

2242
02:45:51,400 --> 02:45:52,880
the politics.

2243
02:45:52,880 --> 02:45:55,840
Whether you're for or against Obama is irrelevant.

2244
02:45:55,840 --> 02:46:01,160
If you go by the fruits of what their actions bear, you'd have to be an idiot to support

2245
02:46:01,160 --> 02:46:02,160
them.

2246
02:46:02,160 --> 02:46:06,720
All we're seeing the government do is wars, and we're seeing corruption and robbery of

2247
02:46:06,720 --> 02:46:07,720
taxpayers.

2248
02:46:07,720 --> 02:46:12,400
Obama is merely, that's what you should focus more on, and I do agree with that.

2249
02:46:12,400 --> 02:46:14,680
Well, the globalist wanted Obama.

2250
02:46:14,680 --> 02:46:15,680
Why is that?

2251
02:46:15,680 --> 02:46:19,440
Well, if the globalists want to open borders, I can intellectually tell you why it's bad,

2252
02:46:19,440 --> 02:46:20,960
but I just automatically am against it.

2253
02:46:20,960 --> 02:46:24,800
If the globalists want our guns, I can tell you intellectually why I'm against it, but

2254
02:46:24,800 --> 02:46:27,400
they're against it, I'm against them.

2255
02:46:27,400 --> 02:46:30,080
You see, I'm pro-gun because they're anti-gun.

2256
02:46:30,080 --> 02:46:33,640
I'm pro-sovereignty because they're anti-sovereignty, and I have all my reasons for that.

2257
02:46:33,640 --> 02:46:34,640
They have their reasons.

2258
02:46:34,640 --> 02:46:37,440
I don't know what you're getting at, Joe, I appreciate your call.

2259
02:46:37,440 --> 02:46:43,640
I mean, these Obama supporters, just God bless them, you know Republicans are pretty dumbed

2260
02:46:43,640 --> 02:46:50,360
down as well, but at least they say they want smaller government and no collectivism ruins

2261
02:46:50,360 --> 02:46:51,360
people.

2262
02:46:51,360 --> 02:46:55,000
And the Republicans are just basically the other side of the system and they just move

2263
02:46:55,000 --> 02:46:56,640
forward as well.

2264
02:46:56,640 --> 02:46:59,560
But I mean, Democrats, I mean, it's about being part of a club.

2265
02:46:59,560 --> 02:47:04,000
It's about having the Obama sticker and people go, you're liberal, you're good.

2266
02:47:04,000 --> 02:47:11,120
No, you support a front guy, a pitchman for a globalist operation feeding us GMO and fluoride

2267
02:47:11,120 --> 02:47:17,000
and cancer viruses in the vaccines and radioactive isotopes in the water and launching wars all

2268
02:47:17,000 --> 02:47:18,440
over the place.

2269
02:47:18,440 --> 02:47:21,960
And I have Obama supporters, I go, listen, these wars are wrong in person.

2270
02:47:21,960 --> 02:47:26,520
They go, you're just sad you lost and I'm like, no, no, listen, they're expanding wars.

2271
02:47:26,520 --> 02:47:27,520
It's really bad.

2272
02:47:27,520 --> 02:47:32,580
Oh, yeah, you wish Romney would have been better and I'm like, you need to recognize

2273
02:47:32,580 --> 02:47:34,520
it's wrong what Obama's doing.

2274
02:47:34,520 --> 02:47:35,520
Can you at least do that?

2275
02:47:35,520 --> 02:47:39,360
They go, no, you're just trying to use that against him, but you don't like him.

2276
02:47:39,360 --> 02:47:43,520
I'm just like, man, and it's the helplessness of them.

2277
02:47:43,520 --> 02:47:48,280
Jamie in New Mexico, Obama supporter, go ahead, you're on the air.

2278
02:47:48,280 --> 02:47:53,520
Yes, first time caller, long time listener.

2279
02:47:53,520 --> 02:48:01,680
I am forced to support Obama because I am living off of welfare and food stamps.

2280
02:48:01,680 --> 02:48:05,880
It is real easy to get food stamps.

2281
02:48:05,880 --> 02:48:09,960
And depending on your employer, it's really easy to get unemployment benefits.

2282
02:48:09,960 --> 02:48:13,760
I'm making about $100 less than I was.

2283
02:48:13,760 --> 02:48:18,320
And right now it's a good thing because I'd probably be on the streets.

2284
02:48:18,320 --> 02:48:21,240
I'd probably be living with my mom or my brother.

2285
02:48:21,240 --> 02:48:25,560
You realize with 50 million people on food stamps, it destroys all the small businesses

2286
02:48:25,560 --> 02:48:29,800
because only the big businesses are designed to take the money and the cards.

2287
02:48:29,800 --> 02:48:31,680
And you understand in the end, you're going to get nothing.

2288
02:48:31,680 --> 02:48:40,720
I mean, you understand, have you heard my story of how you domesticate hogs, bald hogs?

2289
02:48:40,720 --> 02:48:45,440
The reason why, it's only for this month, because I am looking currently-

2290
02:48:45,440 --> 02:48:47,400
Listen, I'm not saying you're bad.

2291
02:48:47,400 --> 02:48:50,940
Listen, if people are really downing out the churches or state government, there should

2292
02:48:50,940 --> 02:48:53,440
be some form of safety net.

2293
02:48:53,440 --> 02:48:57,760
This isn't a safety net, this is a safety news, sir.

2294
02:48:57,760 --> 02:49:05,600
And again, you say you support Obama, he's only doing all this to get you dependent so

2295
02:49:05,600 --> 02:49:07,880
he can get the guns and then drop the hammer.

2296
02:49:07,880 --> 02:49:11,240
They've already done this in Europe and Mexico and everywhere else.

2297
02:49:11,240 --> 02:49:14,040
Just so long as you know, it's a trap.

2298
02:49:14,040 --> 02:49:18,760
I mean, look, there are calories in a butterscotch candy.

2299
02:49:18,760 --> 02:49:22,400
A small butterscotch candy probably has 50 calories, okay?

2300
02:49:22,400 --> 02:49:24,080
Do you agree with me on that?

2301
02:49:24,080 --> 02:49:25,080
Yes.

2302
02:49:25,080 --> 02:49:28,600
Now, a butterscotch candy is not bad in and of itself.

2303
02:49:28,600 --> 02:49:32,320
If a man opens a van door at a playground and tells a three-year-old his parents aren't

2304
02:49:32,320 --> 02:49:37,160
watching him, get in the car, I got butterscotch, should the child get in the car for the butterscotch

2305
02:49:37,160 --> 02:49:38,160
candy?

2306
02:49:38,160 --> 02:49:39,160
Negative.

2307
02:49:39,160 --> 02:49:43,880
But I mean, it's a free candy.

2308
02:49:43,880 --> 02:49:47,440
I see your point.

2309
02:49:47,440 --> 02:49:53,120
I was at the EBT, the food stamp place yesterday.

2310
02:49:53,120 --> 02:49:58,320
People purposefully have kids to get on welfare.

2311
02:49:58,320 --> 02:50:02,920
People purposefully quit their jobs to get on unemployment.

2312
02:50:02,920 --> 02:50:04,760
It's too easy.

2313
02:50:04,760 --> 02:50:06,600
That's why I'm not understanding.

2314
02:50:06,600 --> 02:50:08,240
No, I really respect you.

2315
02:50:08,240 --> 02:50:13,280
Listen, I respect you because when we open these phones up for Obama people, the really

2316
02:50:13,280 --> 02:50:18,240
arrogant ones call in and are very entertaining, but it's sad to hear real Obama supporters

2317
02:50:18,240 --> 02:50:21,320
calling and go, I don't have a job and I won't have food.

2318
02:50:21,320 --> 02:50:25,800
That's what they've done to America that 50 years ago could feed the whole world.

2319
02:50:25,800 --> 02:50:28,200
And now we can't even feed ourselves.

2320
02:50:28,200 --> 02:50:29,680
I'm going to skip this network break.

2321
02:50:29,680 --> 02:50:31,280
I'm bankrupting the network doing this.

2322
02:50:31,280 --> 02:50:32,280
God bless you, sir.

2323
02:50:32,280 --> 02:50:33,280
I appreciate your call.

2324
02:50:33,280 --> 02:50:37,080
I'm going to skip this network break because I've got to premiere this special report here

2325
02:50:37,080 --> 02:50:39,520
in a moment and finish up with your calls.

2326
02:50:39,520 --> 02:50:43,040
And briefly, there'll come a time when the country's so poor, people won't even be able

2327
02:50:43,040 --> 02:50:44,880
to support us with sponsorship.

2328
02:50:44,880 --> 02:50:47,500
You won't even be able, your dollar will be so worthless, you won't be able to even get

2329
02:50:47,500 --> 02:50:48,800
a water filtration system.

2330
02:50:48,800 --> 02:50:51,640
You won't be able to buy the magazine in bulk to give it out to people.

2331
02:50:51,640 --> 02:50:52,640
That's their plan.

2332
02:50:52,640 --> 02:50:55,640
The Bilderberg Group has bragged, Paul has an article out today that they want to make

2333
02:50:55,640 --> 02:50:58,680
us poor to control us.

2334
02:50:58,680 --> 02:51:01,160
Making you poor is a tool of total control.

2335
02:51:01,160 --> 02:51:04,160
And they've done everything they can to shut this country down.

2336
02:51:04,160 --> 02:51:07,740
Believe me, I know.

2337
02:51:07,740 --> 02:51:12,960
And it is very, very sad.

2338
02:51:12,960 --> 02:51:17,280
I just hope listeners will support the broadcast, A, by spreading the word about the AM and

2339
02:51:17,280 --> 02:51:22,680
FM stations you're listening to, Global Shortwave, Internet Streams, and Infowars.com, the video

2340
02:51:22,680 --> 02:51:24,000
streams at prisonplanet.tv.

2341
02:51:24,000 --> 02:51:27,920
I hope you'll send it out to your email list, your Facebook, your Twitter.

2342
02:51:27,920 --> 02:51:32,000
Get our stories out, folks, retweet the articles we send out at Real Alex Jones.

2343
02:51:32,000 --> 02:51:36,720
You have the power, but you have to get aggressive and vote with your dollars and your energy

2344
02:51:36,720 --> 02:51:42,560
to promote broadcasts like this, these oases of truth, so that we can get the information

2345
02:51:42,560 --> 02:51:44,800
out to checkmate the globalists.

2346
02:51:44,800 --> 02:51:45,800
And we're close.

2347
02:51:45,800 --> 02:51:49,760
I tell you, we're in the fight.

2348
02:51:49,760 --> 02:51:51,880
That's why they're coming down on us, okay?

2349
02:51:51,880 --> 02:51:56,680
But I mean, it's kind of like a bully starts beating you up, and you get a good lick in,

2350
02:51:56,680 --> 02:51:58,880
and they go, whoa, this guy can fight.

2351
02:51:58,880 --> 02:52:02,200
Now the real fight's about to start, okay?

2352
02:52:02,200 --> 02:52:04,480
So I mean, it's on, all right?

2353
02:52:04,480 --> 02:52:08,320
I mean, I'm here to tell you, this is it.

2354
02:52:08,320 --> 02:52:14,560
Every expert we talk to says their spotty sense, I just got a complete chill, is off

2355
02:52:14,560 --> 02:52:16,280
the chart right now.

2356
02:52:16,280 --> 02:52:20,640
Gosh, I got goosebumps on my face, look at that.

2357
02:52:20,640 --> 02:52:23,840
I mean, this is not a game, ladies and gentlemen.

2358
02:52:23,840 --> 02:52:25,980
This is gut check time, okay?

2359
02:52:25,980 --> 02:52:28,960
This is not theatrics here on the radio.

2360
02:52:28,960 --> 02:52:32,480
This is not a game.

2361
02:52:32,480 --> 02:52:35,600
And they're gonna bankrupt us forever, very soon, and put us under agenda 21.

2362
02:52:35,600 --> 02:52:42,720
They want you on welfare to make you go live in a 200 square foot house room.

2363
02:52:42,720 --> 02:52:47,560
They're already making welfare recipients take unlimited shots, like 50 a year.

2364
02:52:47,560 --> 02:52:52,800
All right, I'm gonna go to this special report, it's very powerful.

2365
02:52:52,800 --> 02:52:56,920
We're gonna give it a title in the next hour and put it up at infoawars.com.

2366
02:52:56,920 --> 02:53:01,420
Get it, Facebook it, put it out on Twitter, put it out on YouTube, talk it up, get it

2367
02:53:01,420 --> 02:53:02,420
out there.

2368
02:53:02,420 --> 02:53:05,960
Fight the COINTELPRO trying to block our videos, trying to distract people.

2369
02:53:05,960 --> 02:53:08,280
You cannot be stopped if you take action.

2370
02:53:08,280 --> 02:53:10,280
Little things turn into big things.

2371
02:53:10,280 --> 02:53:15,180
Small things can grow like a mustard seed.

2372
02:53:15,180 --> 02:53:16,640
Big things have small beginnings.

2373
02:53:16,640 --> 02:53:23,000
So this video is our answer to the demand a plan Hollywood Bloomberg turning the guns

2374
02:53:23,000 --> 02:53:24,000
video.

2375
02:53:24,000 --> 02:53:29,240
And it gets into false flag democide, you name it, put together by Melissa Melton and

2376
02:53:29,240 --> 02:53:31,080
the rest of our crew.

2377
02:53:31,080 --> 02:53:32,080
Here it is.

2378
02:53:32,080 --> 02:53:33,080
Northwoods.

2379
02:53:33,080 --> 02:53:34,080
Gulf of Tonkin.

2380
02:53:34,080 --> 02:53:35,080
Gladio.

2381
02:53:35,080 --> 02:53:36,080
Kent State.

2382
02:53:36,080 --> 02:53:37,080
Ruby Ridge.

2383
02:53:37,080 --> 02:53:38,080
Waco.

2384
02:53:38,080 --> 02:53:39,260
Oklahoma City.

2385
02:53:39,260 --> 02:53:40,840
The World Trade Center.

2386
02:53:40,840 --> 02:53:41,840
The Pentagon.

2387
02:53:41,840 --> 02:53:42,840
Shanksville.

2388
02:53:42,840 --> 02:53:44,720
Hurricane Katrina.

2389
02:53:44,720 --> 02:53:46,560
Fast and furious.

2390
02:53:46,560 --> 02:53:48,260
Fast and furious.

2391
02:53:48,260 --> 02:53:49,500
Fast and furious.

2392
02:53:49,500 --> 02:53:50,440
How many more?

2393
02:53:50,440 --> 02:53:51,440
How many more?

2394
02:53:51,440 --> 02:53:53,500
How many more false flags?

2395
02:53:53,500 --> 02:53:54,500
How many more?

2396
02:53:54,500 --> 02:53:56,840
How many more government buildings?

2397
02:53:56,840 --> 02:53:58,840
How many more innocent people?

2398
02:53:58,840 --> 02:53:59,960
How many more?

2399
02:53:59,960 --> 02:54:00,960
How many more?

2400
02:54:00,960 --> 02:54:04,760
What has been the number one cause of unnatural death in history?

2401
02:54:04,760 --> 02:54:09,200
Democide or death by government has killed 290 million people on record.

2402
02:54:09,200 --> 02:54:17,640
Two hundred and ninety million people killed killed 290 million killed by government.

2403
02:54:17,640 --> 02:54:25,960
The government, the number one killer in history is democide, democide, democide death by government.

2404
02:54:25,960 --> 02:54:26,960
Look it up.

2405
02:54:26,960 --> 02:54:27,960
Go look it up.

2406
02:54:27,960 --> 02:54:32,160
In the 20th century, government murdered four times as many people as were killed in all

2407
02:54:32,160 --> 02:54:35,520
the international and domestic wars combined.

2408
02:54:35,520 --> 02:54:41,200
USSR, 61,911,000 people killed.

2409
02:54:41,200 --> 02:54:45,040
Hitler's Germany, nearly 21 million people killed.

2410
02:54:45,040 --> 02:54:49,760
Japan's imperialism, nearly 6 million people killed.

2411
02:54:49,760 --> 02:54:53,280
Western colonization killed over 50 million people.

2412
02:54:53,280 --> 02:54:58,960
Pol Pot's Cambodia, funded by the US government, 2 million people killed.

2413
02:54:58,960 --> 02:55:06,160
China's Communist Party, as many as 76 million people killed between 1949 and 1987.

2414
02:55:06,160 --> 02:55:09,120
And the list goes on and on.

2415
02:55:09,120 --> 02:55:14,120
So now you know the most dangerous thing to you and your family in the world is government.

2416
02:55:14,120 --> 02:55:19,000
Because mass murderers agree, gun control works.

2417
02:55:19,000 --> 02:55:21,360
Disarming citizens is democide.

2418
02:55:21,360 --> 02:55:23,800
Disarming citizens is democide.

2419
02:55:23,800 --> 02:55:25,240
Disarming people is democide.

2420
02:55:25,240 --> 02:55:28,520
How many people have died because of Fast and Furious?

2421
02:55:28,520 --> 02:55:30,720
No more false flags.

2422
02:55:30,720 --> 02:55:31,720
Enough.

2423
02:55:31,720 --> 02:55:32,720
Enough.

2424
02:55:32,720 --> 02:55:33,800
It's enough.

2425
02:55:33,800 --> 02:55:35,000
Now is the time.

2426
02:55:35,000 --> 02:55:36,000
It's time.

2427
02:55:36,000 --> 02:55:40,920
It's time to realize that when the government takes your guns, people die.

2428
02:55:40,920 --> 02:55:45,160
It's time to realize the biggest threat to you and your family is government.

2429
02:55:45,160 --> 02:55:49,560
It's time to recognize government is the greatest killer of all time.

2430
02:55:49,560 --> 02:55:50,560
It's time.

2431
02:55:50,560 --> 02:55:51,920
Demand a plan.

2432
02:55:51,920 --> 02:55:52,920
Demand.

2433
02:55:52,920 --> 02:55:53,920
Demand a plan.

2434
02:55:53,920 --> 02:55:56,080
Demand a plan right now.

2435
02:55:56,080 --> 02:55:57,600
As a free human being.

2436
02:55:57,600 --> 02:55:58,800
As an American.

2437
02:55:58,800 --> 02:56:00,000
As an American.

2438
02:56:00,000 --> 02:56:01,640
As an American citizen.

2439
02:56:01,640 --> 02:56:02,820
As a patriot.

2440
02:56:02,820 --> 02:56:04,320
For your children.

2441
02:56:04,320 --> 02:56:09,800
Demand to know why you and your children are forced into gun-free zones while government

2442
02:56:09,800 --> 02:56:15,480
officials, celebrities, and their children are protected by armed guards.

2443
02:56:15,480 --> 02:56:18,400
Demand they show you the word hunting in the Second Amendment.

2444
02:56:18,400 --> 02:56:22,620
Demand to know why the government shipped thousands of guns to Mexican drug cartels.

2445
02:56:22,620 --> 02:56:26,200
Demand our government stops blowing up federal buildings.

2446
02:56:26,200 --> 02:56:31,640
Demand that our troops stop protecting opium fields in Afghanistan and come home.

2447
02:56:31,640 --> 02:56:34,240
Demand the government stop this phony drug war.

2448
02:56:34,240 --> 02:56:38,920
Demand to know why the Department of Homeland Security bought more than 1.6 billion hollow

2449
02:56:38,920 --> 02:56:41,200
point bullets with our money.

2450
02:56:41,200 --> 02:56:45,880
Demand our government stop poisoning our food supply with genetically modified organisms.

2451
02:56:45,880 --> 02:56:50,520
Demand that President Obama stops killing innocent women and children all around the

2452
02:56:50,520 --> 02:56:53,600
world with his illegal drone attacks.

2453
02:56:53,600 --> 02:56:56,620
Demand an end to these unconstitutional wars.

2454
02:56:56,620 --> 02:57:00,240
Demand that the TSA stop groping our genitals at the airport.

2455
02:57:00,240 --> 02:57:04,720
Demand that the NSA stop illegally spying on all of us all the time.

2456
02:57:04,720 --> 02:57:08,020
Demand that toxic fluoride be removed from the water supply.

2457
02:57:08,020 --> 02:57:13,580
Demand our politicians uphold the Constitution and Bill of Rights as they swore to when they

2458
02:57:13,580 --> 02:57:14,920
took office.

2459
02:57:14,920 --> 02:57:15,920
It's time.

2460
02:57:15,920 --> 02:57:19,880
It's time for our leaders to act like leaders.

2461
02:57:19,880 --> 02:57:23,200
It's time for our leaders to read the Constitution.

2462
02:57:23,200 --> 02:57:26,600
It's time for our leaders to obey the Constitution.

2463
02:57:26,600 --> 02:57:27,680
The Constitution.

2464
02:57:27,680 --> 02:57:29,220
The Constitution.

2465
02:57:29,220 --> 02:57:33,840
Because a well regulated militia with 10 round magazines wouldn't last very long.

2466
02:57:33,840 --> 02:57:36,600
Demand an end to citizen disarmament.

2467
02:57:36,600 --> 02:57:38,260
Government sponsored terror.

2468
02:57:38,260 --> 02:57:39,560
And democide.

2469
02:57:39,560 --> 02:57:42,040
Democide, death by government.

2470
02:57:42,040 --> 02:57:43,600
Right now.

2471
02:57:43,600 --> 02:57:44,760
Right now.

2472
02:57:44,760 --> 02:57:46,140
Right now.

2473
02:57:46,140 --> 02:57:52,400
We are sick and tired of our tyrannical government taking away our rights.

2474
02:57:52,400 --> 02:57:54,080
Stop stealing our rights.

2475
02:57:54,080 --> 02:57:55,200
Our rights.

2476
02:57:55,200 --> 02:57:56,200
Our rights.

2477
02:57:56,200 --> 02:57:59,240
How many more people does government have to kill?

2478
02:57:59,240 --> 02:58:00,240
Enough.

2479
02:58:00,240 --> 02:58:01,240
Enough.

2480
02:58:01,240 --> 02:58:02,240
Enough already.

2481
02:58:02,240 --> 02:58:03,240
Enough.

2482
02:58:03,240 --> 02:58:04,240
Enough.

2483
02:58:04,240 --> 02:58:05,240
Enough.

2484
02:58:05,240 --> 02:58:06,240
Enough.

2485
02:58:06,240 --> 02:58:07,240
Enough.

2486
02:58:07,240 --> 02:58:13,640
Enough of the people laying down and letting government kill them in mass after disarming

2487
02:58:13,640 --> 02:58:17,640
them as they've done throughout history over and over again.

2488
02:58:17,640 --> 02:58:24,400
Enough, enough to laying down and letting these criminals use us up like slaves.

2489
02:58:24,400 --> 02:58:32,160
All right, folks, the full video with all the documentation is going up at Infowars.com

2490
02:58:32,160 --> 02:58:34,040
the next 10 minutes.

2491
02:58:34,040 --> 02:58:36,320
Get it out to everyone you know.

2492
02:58:36,320 --> 02:58:46,080
Thank you for listening to GCN.

Visit GCNlive.com today.

2494
02:58:52,400 --> 02:58:56,880
We have witnessed two terrible storms in the east, but we are still in the eye of the perfect

2495
02:58:56,880 --> 02:58:57,880
storm.

2496
02:58:57,880 --> 02:59:01,480
The most devastating economic conditions since the Great Depression.

2497
02:59:01,480 --> 02:59:04,080
America's worst drought in agricultural history.

2498
02:59:04,080 --> 02:59:07,120
And now the economic results of the presidential election.

2499
02:59:07,120 --> 02:59:10,400
This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.

2500
02:59:10,400 --> 02:59:14,680
I just doubled down and got even more supplies from Eastwood Direct and I recommend you do

2501
02:59:14,680 --> 02:59:15,680
the same.

2502
02:59:15,680 --> 02:59:18,360
It's time to get your own supply from E Foods Direct.

2503
02:59:18,360 --> 02:59:21,960
I know I won't be standing in a bread line trading my freedom for food.

2504
02:59:21,960 --> 02:59:26,360
I'm taking control of my future and you're nuts if you don't do the same.

2505
02:59:26,360 --> 02:59:30,400
Go to efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex to find the specials and you can start with

2506
02:59:30,400 --> 02:59:34,160
a holiday gift pack that's normally $80 now under 50 bucks.

2507
02:59:34,160 --> 02:59:36,760
Remember, I can warn you, but I can't feed you.

2508
02:59:36,760 --> 02:59:41,720
Call 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.

2509
02:59:41,720 --> 02:59:45,360
Would you rather prepare six months too early or one day too late?

2510
02:59:45,360 --> 02:59:52,320
Call 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.

2511
02:59:52,320 --> 02:59:55,800
Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.

2512
02:59:55,800 --> 03:00:09,400
You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.

2513
03:00:09,400 --> 03:00:18,120
We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.

2514
03:00:18,120 --> 03:00:24,600
Rallying patriots worldwide.

2515
03:00:24,600 --> 03:00:27,440
You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.

2516
03:00:27,440 --> 03:00:32,880
When populations get decadent and decide it's cool to lay down a big government, everything

2517
03:00:32,880 --> 03:00:37,800
collapses and you get put in forced labor brigades and the people that were on the welfare

2518
03:00:37,800 --> 03:00:39,680
usually right in there in the forced labor.

2519
03:00:39,680 --> 03:00:43,080
Of course, people that actually work usually make better workers, so it's the former welfare

2520
03:00:43,080 --> 03:00:46,960
folks with their machine guns prodding us around like the Soviet Union.

2521
03:00:46,960 --> 03:00:50,240
Let's go to Jeannie who says she's a real Obama supporter.

2522
03:00:50,240 --> 03:00:51,720
She's a KLBJ 590 listener.

2523
03:00:51,720 --> 03:00:54,760
I guess she's listening on 90.1 though right now.

2524
03:00:54,760 --> 03:00:56,360
Jeannie, show up.

2525
03:00:56,360 --> 03:00:58,120
Tell me about how great Obama is.

2526
03:00:58,120 --> 03:01:03,440
Well, I mean, I'm not going to say how great, but Alex, I was a Ron Paul supporter.

2527
03:01:03,440 --> 03:01:09,040
When he came out of the president election, I had to, who else was I going to vote for?

2528
03:01:09,040 --> 03:01:10,040
Think about it.

2529
03:01:10,040 --> 03:01:15,080
To me, Romney, all the Republicans, I feel like he wanted to take women's rights away

2530
03:01:15,080 --> 03:01:16,080
and all this.

2531
03:01:16,080 --> 03:01:17,080
I could not-

2532
03:01:17,080 --> 03:01:21,320
Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, we're not even saying you should have voted

2533
03:01:21,320 --> 03:01:22,320
for Romney.

2534
03:01:22,320 --> 03:01:27,660
It's the endorsement of Obama and people feeling like they had a victory because he's in there

2535
03:01:27,660 --> 03:01:30,120
now and he's your president.

2536
03:01:30,120 --> 03:01:31,600
It was all rigged.

2537
03:01:31,600 --> 03:01:36,560
Okay, that's what I'm telling you is that it's rigged and it is wrong what they did

2538
03:01:36,560 --> 03:01:37,560
to Ron Paul.

2539
03:01:37,560 --> 03:01:41,680
It's probably why Romney overtly lost, but there's election fraud as well.

2540
03:01:41,680 --> 03:01:47,000
My point is, is that America is going in a socialist direction and socialism, ma'am,

2541
03:01:47,000 --> 03:01:48,000
is a nightmare.

2542
03:01:48,000 --> 03:01:55,160
I mean, France now has over 80% taxes with a 75% tax on everything above that.

2543
03:01:55,160 --> 03:01:59,960
You make over a million dollars, you pay 80% plus 75 on any money you keep.

2544
03:01:59,960 --> 03:02:04,160
I mean, should taxes be at 99% or 100%?

2545
03:02:04,160 --> 03:02:08,680
Alex, I wanna say something controversial and I don't care if it gets everyone mad,

2546
03:02:08,680 --> 03:02:13,800
but I'm gonna say to me, the reason this country is going to you know where is because of old

2547
03:02:13,800 --> 03:02:17,520
white men who are running the Senate and Congress who have been running it.

2548
03:02:17,520 --> 03:02:22,720
We have what, 1% of Mexicans and black people that are in the Congress Senate?

2549
03:02:22,720 --> 03:02:25,760
No, it's not, are you kidding?

2550
03:02:25,760 --> 03:02:27,160
It's all time record high.

2551
03:02:27,160 --> 03:02:29,080
There's like 20 women in the Senate alone.

2552
03:02:29,080 --> 03:02:33,800
White, old men running this country, the Senate and Congress-

2553
03:02:33,800 --> 03:02:35,560
All right, ma'am, ma'am, hold on, ma'am.

2554
03:02:35,560 --> 03:02:40,400
Are you really this ding-dang bad where it's just fun to, hold on, I know the Democrats

2555
03:02:40,400 --> 03:02:41,400
are all about race.

2556
03:02:41,400 --> 03:02:43,220
You sound like a white lady, I don't know who you are.

2557
03:02:43,220 --> 03:02:46,720
But the point is, it's like just fun to put down white people and I get that's fun.

2558
03:02:46,720 --> 03:02:48,760
I mean, that's the new trendy thing.

2559
03:02:48,760 --> 03:02:49,760
I get it.

2560
03:02:49,760 --> 03:02:52,540
Jumping off cliffs is fun too.

2561
03:02:52,540 --> 03:02:59,360
The point is, is that certainly, you know, ma'am, that Dianne Feinstein is a quote white

2562
03:02:59,360 --> 03:03:01,840
lady and she's saying turn our guns in.

2563
03:03:01,840 --> 03:03:05,480
So if she's white, if being white is bad, I guess she's a woman though, I must make

2564
03:03:05,480 --> 03:03:06,480
it okay.

2565
03:03:06,480 --> 03:03:08,400
Do you support us turning our guns in?

2566
03:03:08,400 --> 03:03:10,400
No, I don't, I don't.

2567
03:03:10,400 --> 03:03:12,800
I mean, I really don't, I'm against that.

2568
03:03:12,800 --> 03:03:18,200
But to me, that's my opinion as a 49 year old Mexican woman living in Texas, I feel

2569
03:03:18,200 --> 03:03:23,640
the reason this country is going to crap is because of all white men running it.

2570
03:03:23,640 --> 03:03:29,200
Let me be clear, okay, so why is Nigeria, that's all black people running that, why

2571
03:03:29,200 --> 03:03:30,200
is that going to hell?

2572
03:03:30,200 --> 03:03:35,520
Or let me ask you a question, why is Mexico, I guess Mexico is doing really good, cuz there's,

2573
03:03:35,520 --> 03:03:42,000
I bet I mean Mexico, I mean, is that the fault of all white men?

2574
03:03:42,000 --> 03:03:45,640
How many people are that are white, older men running the Congress and Senate?

2575
03:03:45,640 --> 03:03:48,400
Can you tell me why we are in this situation?

2576
03:03:48,400 --> 03:03:53,640
Well, Japan is in a total depression for about 15 years, and I mean, is that the fault of

2577
03:03:53,640 --> 03:03:54,640
all white men?

2578
03:03:54,640 --> 03:03:59,640
I wonder who, that's Steve, president, but- Well, ma'am, ma'am, I mean, listen, I'm asking

2579
03:03:59,640 --> 03:04:04,000
you something here, cuz you know white skin is only a lack of pigment.

2580
03:04:04,000 --> 03:04:09,620
Yeah, Alex, look, I'm being honest- But I mean, hold on, I understand, I got it,

2581
03:04:09,620 --> 03:04:11,080
is it racist to own guns?

2582
03:04:11,080 --> 03:04:15,760
Start putting him down also, if it was a Mexican president, and we were in this situation,

2583
03:04:15,760 --> 03:04:21,720
I have no problem saying, he's a problem- Hold on, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, did you hear

2584
03:04:21,720 --> 03:04:22,720
me?

2585
03:04:22,720 --> 03:04:27,120
The president is a puppet, we're talking about how you're supporting a puppet.

2586
03:04:27,120 --> 03:04:33,720
Alex, we can agree to disagree- No, no, but say you like Obama, but you don't

2587
03:04:33,720 --> 03:04:34,720
like turning your guns in.

2588
03:04:34,720 --> 03:04:41,040
No, I'm not gonna- I'm gonna ask you a question, should we get rid of our Congress and put

2589
03:04:41,040 --> 03:04:43,400
in the Mexican Congress, would that make things better?

2590
03:04:43,400 --> 03:04:48,240
No, I think we should start all over- But wait a minute, you just said, maybe we

2591
03:04:48,240 --> 03:04:52,720
should go down to Mexico, that's kinda what the North American Union is, and bring all

2592
03:04:52,720 --> 03:04:57,680
those great people, cuz they're Hispanic, up here to run, they would do a better job.

2593
03:04:57,680 --> 03:05:01,240
I think she's actually right, folks, we gotta continue here, let's continue.

2594
03:05:01,240 --> 03:05:07,760
Hello, I'm Alex Jones, myself, my family, the Infowars.com team want to relay to you

2595
03:05:07,760 --> 03:05:13,040
and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalist on every

2596
03:05:13,040 --> 03:05:14,040
front.

2597
03:05:14,040 --> 03:05:19,800
Infowars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats, but we can't do that without

2598
03:05:19,800 --> 03:05:20,800
your help.

2599
03:05:20,800 --> 03:05:26,040
By getting the films, bumper stickers, and t-shirts at Infowars.com, you will wake up

2600
03:05:26,040 --> 03:05:32,060
people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.

2601
03:05:32,060 --> 03:05:37,000
We need your help to spread the word like never before, they wish to hide themselves

2602
03:05:37,000 --> 03:05:41,760
during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.

2603
03:05:41,760 --> 03:05:49,200
You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization

2604
03:05:49,200 --> 03:05:50,760
and ultimate extermination.

2605
03:05:50,760 --> 03:06:01,440
The war is here, it's an Infowar, the spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.

2606
03:06:01,440 --> 03:06:05,200
Who wants to be disease-free, full of energy, and vibrant health?

2607
03:06:05,200 --> 03:06:09,300
Two reasons you may feel constantly tired and run down could be that your body's acid

2608
03:06:09,300 --> 03:06:11,920
level is high and your pH level is low.

2609
03:06:11,920 --> 03:06:13,400
How does acid enter your body?

2610
03:06:13,400 --> 03:06:18,760
A cup of coffee, a sandwich, tap water, stress, and cell phones, plus your own body produces

2611
03:06:18,760 --> 03:06:20,320
acid on a regular basis.

2612
03:06:20,320 --> 03:06:25,140
Alkavision plasma pH drops alkalize the water you drink and raise your pH level.

2613
03:06:25,140 --> 03:06:29,320
They promote more oxygen in your system, higher energy potential, and many other documented

2614
03:06:29,320 --> 03:06:30,320

2620
03:07:02,360 --> 03:07:07,120
We have witnessed two terrible storms in the east, but we are still in the eye of the perfect

2621
03:07:07,120 --> 03:07:08,120
storm.

2622
03:07:08,120 --> 03:07:12,000
The most devastating economic conditions since the Great Depression, America's worst drought

2623
03:07:12,000 --> 03:07:16,800
in agricultural history, and now the economic results of the presidential election.

2624
03:07:16,800 --> 03:07:20,040
This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.

2625
03:07:20,040 --> 03:07:24,240
I just doubled down and got even more supplies from E Foods Direct, and I recommend you do

2626
03:07:24,240 --> 03:07:25,240
the same.

2627
03:07:25,240 --> 03:07:27,840
It's time to get your own supply from E Foods Direct.

2628
03:07:27,840 --> 03:07:31,360
I know I won't be standing in a bread line trading my freedom for food.

2629
03:07:31,360 --> 03:07:35,720
I'm taking control of my future, and you're nuts if you don't do the same.

Go to efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex to find the specials, and you can start with

2633
03:07:49,800 --> 03:07:50,800
forward slash Alex.

2634
03:07:50,800 --> 03:07:54,800
Would you rather prepare six months too early, or one day too late?

2635
03:07:54,800 --> 03:08:00,360
Call 800-409-5633, or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.

2636
03:08:00,360 --> 03:08:06,040
The answer to 1984 is 1776.

2637
03:08:06,040 --> 03:08:26,440
You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.

2638
03:08:26,440 --> 03:08:31,840
Ladies and gentlemen, if you just joined us, you missed an incredible phone call.

2639
03:08:31,840 --> 03:08:37,360
The woman called in, and she said, I am a real Obama supporter, she was real.

2640
03:08:37,360 --> 03:08:42,600
And she said, there are too many white people in Congress, and that's why America's in trouble,

2641
03:08:42,600 --> 03:08:43,960
and that's why I support Obama.

2642
03:08:43,960 --> 03:08:46,880
She said she was Hispanic.

2643
03:08:46,880 --> 03:08:50,600
And I said, so Mexico, should we take the Mexican Congress, one of the most corrupt

2644
03:08:50,600 --> 03:08:53,280
governments in the world, and bring it up here?

2645
03:08:53,280 --> 03:08:56,480
Governments are corrupt, whether you're in Africa, or whether you're in Iran, or whether

2646
03:08:56,480 --> 03:08:59,280
you're in Israel, or whether you're in Russia.

2647
03:08:59,280 --> 03:09:04,820
You read the Bible, it talks about government being wicked, and wickedness in high places,

2648
03:09:04,820 --> 03:09:05,820
and the god of this world.

2649
03:09:05,820 --> 03:09:10,440
Now, whether you believe in a physical devil or not, the issue is, historically, most governments

2650
03:09:10,440 --> 03:09:16,020
are bad, and they tend to get worse, and worse, and worse the longer they're in.

2651
03:09:16,020 --> 03:09:20,760
And I gotta be honest with you, I mean, the ignorance of Obama supporters, we got David

2652
03:09:20,760 --> 03:09:24,560
Montana says he's an Obama supporter, I'm gonna continue to take Obama supporter calls

2653
03:09:24,560 --> 03:09:33,880
right now on this third day of January 2013, 800-259-9231.

2654
03:09:33,880 --> 03:09:39,740
Program note, there is a video we just premiered that is one of the most powerful short pieces

2655
03:09:39,740 --> 03:09:44,620
we've done in a long time, collaboration between the whole crew, but John Bount and Melissa

2656
03:09:44,620 --> 03:09:46,440
Melton kinda came up with it.

2657
03:09:46,440 --> 03:09:51,200
Or I think simultaneously, Bount said we should do a knockoff of the demand to plan Bloomberg

2658
03:09:51,200 --> 03:09:55,520
thing with all the stars saying turn your guns in.

2659
03:09:55,520 --> 03:10:00,300
And then others have the idea, but the point is, I also had the idea to show Hollywood

2660
03:10:00,300 --> 03:10:02,340
violence and them shooting people.

2661
03:10:02,340 --> 03:10:05,860
And then one of our listeners had that idea, and I never talked about it on air.

2662
03:10:05,860 --> 03:10:10,020
People just have the same thoughts when you're looking at hypocrisy.

2663
03:10:10,020 --> 03:10:14,120
So we put out a new video pointing out that government's been the biggest chiller in history,

2664
03:10:14,120 --> 03:10:15,920
and it shows all the statistics at the end.

2665
03:10:15,920 --> 03:10:19,500
We're gonna put an article up in the next ten minutes or so, they're putting it together

2666
03:10:19,500 --> 03:10:26,940
right now that shows from the University of Hawaii study, cuz I keep saying 260 plus million,

2667
03:10:26,940 --> 03:10:30,540
they corrected me, it was 290 plus million.

2668
03:10:30,540 --> 03:10:35,900
Sometimes I get factoids off, usually to the lower number, my mind tends to underestimate.

2669
03:10:35,900 --> 03:10:40,980
That's why people think I'm exaggerating sometimes, most of the time, I mean, I would literally

2670
03:10:40,980 --> 03:10:47,180
say over 95% of the time, I underestimate.

2671
03:10:47,180 --> 03:10:51,460
Or sometimes I flip numbers, it's almost like dyslexia.

2672
03:10:51,460 --> 03:10:56,540
But side issue, I just want you to know, if you hear me say something wrong sometimes,

2673
03:10:56,540 --> 03:11:03,420
earlier I said 1540, a station was calling in and it was 540.

2674
03:11:03,420 --> 03:11:07,400
The fact is, I'm not following a teleprompter, I'm not following a script here, I'm really

2675
03:11:07,400 --> 03:11:08,400
telling you what I think.

2676
03:11:08,400 --> 03:11:12,580
So you're gonna see some of that, but the point is, government non-military casualties

2677
03:11:12,580 --> 03:11:22,020
200, 290 plus million people killed last century, and so we say demand a plan to stop

2678
03:11:22,020 --> 03:11:25,060
government mass murder.

2679
03:11:25,060 --> 03:11:29,660
And the video will go up at infowars.com for everybody to see it, and I want you to send

2680
03:11:29,660 --> 03:11:32,340
it out on email, Twitter, Facebook, everywhere.

2681
03:11:32,340 --> 03:11:40,140
Get it out to local talk stations, get it out to everybody, and again, it's now live

2682
03:11:40,140 --> 03:11:44,020
on YouTube, Demand a Real Plan is what we call it.

2683
03:11:44,020 --> 03:11:50,300
Demand a Real Plan, Demand a Real Plan, and we're gonna have the statistics that we have

2684
03:11:50,300 --> 03:11:51,540
in it posted under it.

2685
03:11:51,540 --> 03:11:57,860
She's also writing another article that'll be done soon that basically goes with it.

2686
03:11:57,860 --> 03:12:09,900
But for Obama supporters, call in on your Obama phones, 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231.

2687
03:12:09,900 --> 03:12:13,380
Let's go ahead and talk to Dave in Montana.

2688
03:12:13,380 --> 03:12:15,300
Dave, go ahead, you're on the air.

2689
03:12:15,300 --> 03:12:25,100
Alex, I support Obama because I hate the Republicans so much because they hate the 10th Amendment.

2690
03:12:25,100 --> 03:12:29,140
They could have been in office, they could have ran away with the election.

2691
03:12:29,140 --> 03:12:36,500
All they had to do was back up the 17 states that exercised the 10th Amendment-

2692
03:12:36,500 --> 03:12:37,500
For marijuana.

2693
03:12:37,500 --> 03:12:46,740
Allowed their people to use medical cannabis and to use cannabis to hemp, rutialis part

2694
03:12:46,740 --> 03:12:53,060
of the cannabis for industry and jobs and- All right.

2695
03:12:53,060 --> 03:12:54,060
And liberty.

2696
03:12:54,060 --> 03:12:57,940
No, no, I hear you, I'm gonna go back to you, Dave, I'm gonna go back to you.

2697
03:12:57,940 --> 03:13:02,580
This is the best Obama supporter call we've gotten in the five or six shows or sections

2698
03:13:02,580 --> 03:13:06,180
of broadcasts that we've done cuz he actually has an issue.

2699
03:13:06,180 --> 03:13:11,500
That thing about, the Republicans wanna take women's rights, I mean, that's just a pure

2700
03:13:11,500 --> 03:13:13,000
political distraction.

2701
03:13:13,000 --> 03:13:17,580
The state's rights issue, and I've supported decriminalization, I've supported legalization,

2702
03:13:17,580 --> 03:13:19,220
I'm a libertarian.

2703
03:13:19,220 --> 03:13:24,740
And I know all you do is get low quality marijuana full of pesticides and let the corrupt mafia

2704
03:13:24,740 --> 03:13:29,140
and government get a percentage of it by making it illegal, just like in prohibition.

2705
03:13:29,140 --> 03:13:33,020
I'm not a big supporter of alcohol, I think it's more destructive than marijuana.

2706
03:13:33,020 --> 03:13:37,540
And I'm for drug decriminalization, but also I think the state shouldn't be involved in

2707
03:13:37,540 --> 03:13:38,540
alcohol.

2708
03:13:38,540 --> 03:13:40,500
It should be a local thing, a criminal thing.

2709
03:13:40,500 --> 03:13:44,420
You poison somebody with alcohol you sold, you're going to prison.

2710
03:13:44,420 --> 03:13:48,180
Now you poison somebody with alcohol, you just get a fine.

2711
03:13:48,180 --> 03:13:52,620
But side issue, the thing I'm trying to get at here is Obama tripled the raids in California

2712
03:13:52,620 --> 03:13:55,340
on medical cannabis.

2713
03:13:55,340 --> 03:14:00,460
Triple the raids, look it up, I've had all the activists gone.

2714
03:14:00,460 --> 03:14:05,900
So that's the bottom line on that front is that they did noises like they support.

2715
03:14:05,900 --> 03:14:10,300
He said he was against the NDAA, but he actually wrote it, and then said he wouldn't sign it

2716
03:14:10,300 --> 03:14:11,300
but did.

2717
03:14:11,300 --> 03:14:14,460
See Obama, I'll tell you what Obama does.

2718
03:14:14,460 --> 03:14:24,300
He gives you 15 pain pills to put you under, you pass out before he slits your throat.

2719
03:14:24,300 --> 03:14:30,860
The Republicans, they want to just stab you in the back a couple times.

2720
03:14:30,860 --> 03:14:34,860
But they don't give you any painkillers, and if you want to use that analogy.

2721
03:14:34,860 --> 03:14:39,100
And that's the thing about it, it's not, I want to hear from Obama supporters why you

2722
03:14:39,100 --> 03:14:40,100
think he's good.

2723
03:14:40,100 --> 03:14:43,660
I mean, if you say, I don't like him either, but at least he did this, but see you're even

2724
03:14:43,660 --> 03:14:45,300
really wrong about that.

2725
03:14:45,300 --> 03:14:50,260
But I at least understand you had a thought, you had a reason in your mind you thought

2726
03:14:50,260 --> 03:14:51,260
something was going on.

2727
03:14:51,260 --> 03:14:52,420
Let me explain something.

2728
03:14:52,420 --> 03:14:54,980
The globalists are gutting the economy, they're in control of that.

2729
03:14:54,980 --> 03:14:58,860
They're 85 billion of themselves every month, on top of the trillions they already stole.

2730
03:14:58,860 --> 03:15:03,420
And they're gonna pass on the inflation to us, I mean, it's both parties doing it.

2731
03:15:03,420 --> 03:15:07,980
That's why I said, Boehner's gonna sell us out on tax increases, 77% of households got

2732
03:15:07,980 --> 03:15:12,260
a tax increase, more than ten of them.

2733
03:15:12,260 --> 03:15:16,540
Okay, so do you want to tell me how bad the Republicans are?

2734
03:15:16,540 --> 03:15:22,120
The point is the Republicans represent the best people in this country.

2735
03:15:22,120 --> 03:15:28,700
They are the people that soak up the energy of the libertarians, conservatives, constitutionalists

2736
03:15:28,700 --> 03:15:36,940
who compared to the average Democrat are more productive, are more pro-human, pro-life,

2737
03:15:36,940 --> 03:15:37,940
real people.

2738
03:15:37,940 --> 03:15:47,940
Okay, I mean, the average Democrat I know is a helpless, disconnected from reality,

2739
03:15:47,940 --> 03:15:52,620
visibly weak, stupid person who thinks they're real smart.

2740
03:15:52,620 --> 03:16:00,320
The average Republican is a reactive, but hardworking person who's been conned as well,

2741
03:16:00,320 --> 03:16:04,300
but at least believes in private property and the Second Amendment and national sovereignty.

2742
03:16:04,300 --> 03:16:11,260
Sure, they've become territorially supportive of the Republicans, even though they don't

2743
03:16:11,260 --> 03:16:12,260
really like them.

2744
03:16:12,260 --> 03:16:14,860
It's kind of like a husband who doesn't really like their wife, but better not say something

2745
03:16:14,860 --> 03:16:19,300
to my wife, buddy, or I'll punch your lights out.

2746
03:16:19,300 --> 03:16:22,380
And the Democrats know they've taken over and they know the Republicans are bought off,

2747
03:16:22,380 --> 03:16:26,940
so they know that conservatives are gonna leave Republicans and the whole party's just

2748
03:16:26,940 --> 03:16:27,940
gonna die.

2749
03:16:27,940 --> 03:16:32,380
And then it's gonna be a giant Democratic Party dictatorship to split in two, and that's

2750
03:16:32,380 --> 03:16:36,140
actually been their plan, they're talking about that.

2751
03:16:36,140 --> 03:16:40,220
Cancer divides, and they're just gonna hammer us up one side and down the other.

2752
03:16:40,220 --> 03:16:44,340
When they legalize the 30 million illegals and let them bring in their families to have

2753
03:16:44,340 --> 03:16:48,500
anchor babies paid for and everything, it's gonna further bankrupt stuff, drive down wages,

2754
03:16:48,500 --> 03:16:50,140
they're exempt from all the laws.

2755
03:16:50,140 --> 03:16:54,140
Again, not that they're bad people, they're leaving a country brought down by globalism

2756
03:16:54,140 --> 03:16:55,140
as well.

2757
03:16:55,140 --> 03:16:57,500
It's that they're given this free ride.

2758
03:16:57,500 --> 03:17:00,100
Well, it's the same thing with any other group.

2759
03:17:00,100 --> 03:17:05,620
You've got some Hispanic Mexicans who work harder than anybody I've ever seen, who are

2760
03:17:05,620 --> 03:17:09,940
incredibly smart, know how to fix everything, politically know what's going on, and are

2761
03:17:09,940 --> 03:17:11,940
good people.

2762
03:17:11,940 --> 03:17:14,660
And they will not, cuz they're Christians, they're always Christians.

2763
03:17:14,660 --> 03:17:19,660
They won't go take welfare, they're too prideful, they understand it's bad.

2764
03:17:19,660 --> 03:17:23,020
And then you've got the other group, just like with whites or blacks, that wants the

2765
03:17:23,020 --> 03:17:24,700
free ride.

2766
03:17:24,700 --> 03:17:28,380
And it's just disgusting, and everybody's gonna have their future destroyed.

2767
03:17:28,380 --> 03:17:32,580
All I'm telling you is, the people running things are super bad news.

2768
03:17:32,580 --> 03:17:36,500
Let's go to Gordon in Canada, he is a Obama supporter, Gordon, go ahead.

2769
03:17:36,500 --> 03:17:40,060
I was gonna go back to the other guy, but he hung up, go ahead, Gordon.

2770
03:17:40,060 --> 03:17:46,340
Yeah, you mentioned that you believe the president is basically a puppet, is that correct?

2771
03:17:46,340 --> 03:17:50,820
My gosh, he's an absolute New World Order puppet, but he enjoys his work.

2772
03:17:50,820 --> 03:17:58,020
Okay, so we both agree on one thing, at least today, that the president is basically a puppet.

2773
03:17:58,020 --> 03:18:04,260
And really, as a puppet, would you agree that he's basically ineffectual as a president,

2774
03:18:04,260 --> 03:18:06,260
he's merely a puppet?

2775
03:18:06,260 --> 03:18:13,860
Yeah, just like John Boner, John Boehner, but the spectacle of him being the leader,

2776
03:18:13,860 --> 03:18:18,100
that's used to pacify people and to create a false debate.

2777
03:18:18,100 --> 03:18:27,100
I think that as a leader, Obama has been one of the most influential leaders that the United

2778
03:18:27,100 --> 03:18:28,420
States has ever seen.

2779
03:18:28,420 --> 03:18:33,580
Yeah, no, no, Kissinger said that, he said Obama's gonna bring in the New World Order.

2780
03:18:33,580 --> 03:18:39,220
Well, unfortunately, I probably would disagree with you there and say that it was probably

2781
03:18:39,220 --> 03:18:43,700
Franklin Delano Roosevelt that brought in the New World Order a long time ago.

2782
03:18:43,700 --> 03:18:47,460
Yeah, but a beachhead is not true domination.

2783
03:18:47,460 --> 03:18:52,540
See, this country had so much wealth and so much power and was so wild, it's taken them

2784
03:18:52,540 --> 03:18:54,980
80 years to get to this point.

2785
03:18:54,980 --> 03:19:01,660
So see, that's an argument about, they may have declared a federal emergency and set

2786
03:19:01,660 --> 03:19:04,900
up state police or a really federal police, I'm gonna skip this break and then go to the

2787
03:19:04,900 --> 03:19:05,900
bottom of the hour.

2788
03:19:05,900 --> 03:19:09,620
Go ahead and make your point, I'm gonna let you talk.

2789
03:19:09,620 --> 03:19:15,660
Mr. Jones, I just flew into Canada, a very small country of 32 million people.

2790
03:19:15,660 --> 03:19:20,380
I was relatively unaccosted at both security sides of the border.

2791
03:19:20,380 --> 03:19:27,860
I enjoy a job that is based on free market society and the only reason that I'm able

2792
03:19:27,860 --> 03:19:32,700
to enjoy the level of, or the standard of living that I do enjoy in the United States

2793
03:19:32,700 --> 03:19:37,660
is because we have a stable government and right now, the United States government is

2794
03:19:37,660 --> 03:19:42,580
one of the most stable governments in the Western Hemisphere and as long as the President

2795
03:19:42,580 --> 03:19:46,980
of the United States is in power right now, I will continue to enjoy that standard of

2796
03:19:46,980 --> 03:19:47,980
living.

2797
03:19:47,980 --> 03:19:52,900
When I was living under the previous administration's standard of living, it was atrocious.

2798
03:19:52,900 --> 03:19:55,740
The police state was far more worse than it is today.

2799
03:19:55,740 --> 03:20:00,340
I understand where you're coming from, I do believe that we've probably stepped over the

2800
03:20:00,340 --> 03:20:02,220
line in terms of personal liberty.

2801
03:20:02,220 --> 03:20:08,460
But the goal so far is to start labeling the president or to question the president as

2802
03:20:08,460 --> 03:20:10,700
integrity as a man.

2803
03:20:10,700 --> 03:20:15,060
You and I really don't have the luxury of knowing the person or the human being.

2804
03:20:15,060 --> 03:20:23,860
I disagree with that, you will know them by their fruits and the obsession over most Obama

2805
03:20:23,860 --> 03:20:28,420
supporters I talked to who are intelligent will say the things you're saying.

2806
03:20:28,420 --> 03:20:31,580
And then they'll say plus you don't know the man, you don't know what he's going through.

2807
03:20:31,580 --> 03:20:39,020
Listen, I've really watched Obama carefully and I've read his earlier writings and he

2808
03:20:39,020 --> 03:20:44,060
is just another narcissist wanting to dominate people and he's reading off teleprompters.

2809
03:20:44,060 --> 03:20:48,660
I'm saying what Obama signifies and the time we're entering, by the way, I know a lot of

2810
03:20:48,660 --> 03:20:53,540
folks have been in Canada lately, they say it was the worst security they ever went through.

2811
03:20:53,540 --> 03:20:56,340
Now they must have you profiled, that's part of the police state and they're leaving you

2812
03:20:56,340 --> 03:21:00,380
alone cuz your business, you go back and forth.

2813
03:21:00,380 --> 03:21:05,620
Canada just worst experience I ever had at the hands of the quote police, well, not the

2814
03:21:05,620 --> 03:21:11,980
worst but the worst as an adult, as a non teenager was there in Canada.

2815
03:21:11,980 --> 03:21:15,620
So I mean, just to say I'm doing great, I'm doing good.

2816
03:21:15,620 --> 03:21:22,120
All the financial metrics show the Republican and Democratic leadership are hand in glove

2817
03:21:22,120 --> 03:21:24,580
with this banking takeover.

2818
03:21:24,580 --> 03:21:32,280
And for certain people, the economy is doing better but overall worldwide, globalism is

2819
03:21:32,280 --> 03:21:35,940
designed to render us bankrupt.

2820
03:21:35,940 --> 03:21:44,180
And I mean, the globalist state they're using this to bankrupt us and Obama's trying to

2821
03:21:44,180 --> 03:21:49,060
get carbon taxes through worldwide that are designed to block development in the third

2822
03:21:49,060 --> 03:21:53,860
world clean development, cuz they don't want them ever becoming self sufficient.

2823
03:21:53,860 --> 03:21:57,300
They want them poor, or they can hand pick cherry pick who they want to come into the

2824
03:21:57,300 --> 03:22:02,220
armored compounds at the factories with the suicide nets, and then have forced abortions

2825
03:22:02,220 --> 03:22:03,220
inside.

2826
03:22:03,220 --> 03:22:08,420
I mean, I just know too much about the globalist, I mean, people tend to judge things by I mean,

2827
03:22:08,420 --> 03:22:12,680
I guess I could sit here and say, I know a lot of conservative talk show hosts, libertarian

2828
03:22:12,680 --> 03:22:16,620
talk shows, they go well, Alex, things are real bad, but at least, we're gonna get bigger

2829
03:22:16,620 --> 03:22:18,140
audiences during this.

2830
03:22:18,140 --> 03:22:22,980
And that's like saying, like if I own stock in a company that sold chemotherapy stuff

2831
03:22:22,980 --> 03:22:27,220
and one of my kids had cancer and I'm like, well, at least I'm making money off the chemotherapy

2832
03:22:27,220 --> 03:22:29,020
I just bought cuz I have stock in it.

2833
03:22:29,020 --> 03:22:35,780
I mean, it's super hyper predatory and I've read all these books and papers by the top

2834
03:22:35,780 --> 03:22:39,500
technocrats saying they're gonna set up a world government.

2835
03:22:39,500 --> 03:22:43,100
They're gonna make it all look sexy and make it look like the bad stuff they're fighting,

2836
03:22:43,100 --> 03:22:47,500
the good stuff they created, they're gonna shut the economies down.

2837
03:22:47,500 --> 03:22:51,760
And they're going to forcibly reduce population.

2838
03:22:51,760 --> 03:22:54,980
And then I talked to so called lefties and they go, well, there are old people do spend

2839
03:22:54,980 --> 03:22:57,100
too much money at end of life.

2840
03:22:57,100 --> 03:22:59,100
We are collectivist, let's get rid of them.

2841
03:22:59,100 --> 03:23:04,460
I mean, that money that gets spent goes into the system to begin with and funds people.

2842
03:23:04,460 --> 03:23:05,740
Is the medical system corrupt?

2843
03:23:05,740 --> 03:23:07,260
Yeah, because they're teamed up with government.

2844
03:23:07,260 --> 03:23:08,860
I mean, are there reforms?

2845
03:23:08,860 --> 03:23:12,460
Yes, not the ones we're doing, it's gonna double the cost of health care.

2846
03:23:12,460 --> 03:23:17,020
They talk about, see, it's gonna give you less care and charge you more for it.

2847
03:23:17,020 --> 03:23:23,120
It's like you're gonna live in a 250 square foot house and pay 90% or 80% of your money

2848
03:23:23,120 --> 03:23:24,820
in property tax.

2849
03:23:24,820 --> 03:23:29,620
Whereas you put that same amount of energy you expended into work could have lived in

2850
03:23:29,620 --> 03:23:31,580
a 3,000 square foot house.

2851
03:23:31,580 --> 03:23:34,460
I mean, it's just diabolical.

2852
03:23:34,460 --> 03:23:39,140
And I mean, look, they put cancer viruses and vaccines, I can show you all the documents

2853
03:23:39,140 --> 03:23:41,000
I have before many times.

2854
03:23:41,000 --> 03:23:42,460
These are bad people.

2855
03:23:42,460 --> 03:23:48,020
They're doing medical experiments on kids in New York right now, on record.

2856
03:23:48,020 --> 03:23:53,580
And people are like, but Obama, I got an Obama phone or people think the government made

2857
03:23:53,580 --> 03:23:55,540
the economy good when they're in.

2858
03:23:55,540 --> 03:23:59,000
And plus the economy is not good by most metrics.

2859
03:23:59,000 --> 03:24:02,980
Just because you're doing good, I mean, here I am a talk show host reaching millions of

2860
03:24:02,980 --> 03:24:06,340
people, have a big operation, you would call me successful.

2861
03:24:06,340 --> 03:24:08,820
I feel successful for waking people up.

2862
03:24:08,820 --> 03:24:13,580
I don't feel successful because I've got a new Ford pickup truck.

2863
03:24:13,580 --> 03:24:18,540
I don't feel successful because people pull chairs out for me because I'm, quote, a celebrity.

2864
03:24:18,540 --> 03:24:20,300
I mean, how do you gauge success?

2865
03:24:20,300 --> 03:24:21,300
Go ahead.

2866
03:24:21,300 --> 03:24:28,020
Success by the caliber of a person and the integrity of that person, not by his wallet.

2867
03:24:28,020 --> 03:24:34,580
Mr. Jones, I have no doubt that your view of a world government is as such as it is.

2868
03:24:34,580 --> 03:24:37,540
I've been listening to you for a number of years now.

2869
03:24:37,540 --> 03:24:39,580
And I respect your opinions and views.

2870
03:24:39,580 --> 03:24:47,260
However, I do disagree with you with regard to your sense of how quickly we're about to

2871
03:24:47,260 --> 03:24:49,140
go over any precipice.

2872
03:24:49,140 --> 03:24:52,700
When I travel around the world, one of the best countries that I'm always pleased to

2873
03:24:52,700 --> 03:24:55,900
come back to is the United States of America.

2874
03:24:55,900 --> 03:24:58,740
Yes, we have a very- But that's not the government.

2875
03:24:58,740 --> 03:24:59,740
That's not the government.

2876
03:24:59,740 --> 03:25:03,020
Everybody acts like the government made America.

2877
03:25:03,020 --> 03:25:04,660
Guns made America, buddy.

2878
03:25:04,660 --> 03:25:06,140
Whiskey made America.

2879
03:25:06,140 --> 03:25:07,140
Freebooting.

2880
03:25:07,140 --> 03:25:10,620
Pitching people's teeth in made this country.

2881
03:25:10,620 --> 03:25:12,220
Obama did not make this.

2882
03:25:12,220 --> 03:25:13,860
We made this country.

2883
03:25:13,860 --> 03:25:21,420
But when we begin to target one individual and blame him for our collective woes, and

2884
03:25:21,420 --> 03:25:26,420
incessantly, I mean, and constantly, I think we're really truly missing the target.

2885
03:25:26,420 --> 03:25:27,820
Let me ask you a question.

2886
03:25:27,820 --> 03:25:31,740
Do you think it's good to use taxpayer money to ship General Motors, Cadillac, and Volt

2887
03:25:31,740 --> 03:25:34,500
factories to China?

2888
03:25:34,500 --> 03:25:38,980
I understand that there are decisions that are being made in boardrooms all over the

2889
03:25:38,980 --> 03:25:44,580
United States of America that are being made by individuals who are actually being controlled

2890
03:25:44,580 --> 03:25:50,220
by individuals such as the big new Brzezinski, Henry Kissinger, and the likes of the law

2891
03:25:50,220 --> 03:25:51,220
class.

2892
03:25:51,220 --> 03:25:52,820
Exactly, and Obama is their golden child.

2893
03:25:52,820 --> 03:25:54,260
I appreciate your call.

2894
03:25:54,260 --> 03:25:58,020
It's, you know, tomorrow, we'll try to take more calls.

2895
03:25:58,020 --> 03:26:02,700
And I just, you can talk in circles with each other all day.

2896
03:26:02,700 --> 03:26:07,340
I mean, I don't even know what to say anymore.

2897
03:26:07,340 --> 03:26:13,540
I'm not saying Mitt Romney would have been better.

2898
03:26:13,540 --> 03:26:17,740
What is Cynthia McKinney, who's been so demonized with the corporate media say because she exposed

2899
03:26:17,740 --> 03:26:22,660
government slave rings and things, sex slave rings, white slave rings, and the public so

2900
03:26:22,660 --> 03:26:26,220
dumb they always send me emails saying, I see them printed out.

2901
03:26:26,220 --> 03:26:27,720
What about black slaves?

2902
03:26:27,720 --> 03:26:30,060
Sex slavery is called white slavery, folks.

2903
03:26:30,060 --> 03:26:38,020
The point is, is that she says Obama is the more effective evil.

2904
03:26:38,020 --> 03:26:42,700
He's not the lesser, he's not the greater, he's the more effective.

2905
03:26:42,700 --> 03:26:44,720
It's real simple, okay, folks?

2906
03:26:44,720 --> 03:26:48,260
If the globalists want your guns, you want guns.

2907
03:26:48,260 --> 03:26:50,820
If the globalists say don't buy gold, you want gold.

2908
03:26:50,820 --> 03:26:55,900
If the globalists say don't eat organic food, you want organic food.

2909
03:26:55,900 --> 03:27:00,700
If the globalists say it's good to radiate your food, it's bad to radiate your food.

2910
03:27:00,700 --> 03:27:03,060
And then you can go look at the reasons it's bad.

2911
03:27:03,060 --> 03:27:07,140
But in every case, if they say something's good, you better believe it's bad.

2912
03:27:07,140 --> 03:27:12,420
I mean, they call this modern world empowering women.

2913
03:27:12,420 --> 03:27:16,660
Women aren't empowered, they look like they've been run over.

2914
03:27:16,660 --> 03:27:20,920
They've been gaslighted into thinking they're ugly and they don't have any value when their

2915
03:27:20,920 --> 03:27:25,260
family and everything is waiting for them and worshiping them.

2916
03:27:25,260 --> 03:27:26,940
And they're running everything.

2917
03:27:26,940 --> 03:27:29,020
Women have always been the center of everything.

2918
03:27:29,020 --> 03:27:32,940
Women are running everything and they think they don't have anything, cuz the television

2919
03:27:32,940 --> 03:27:36,140
is there showing them this imaginary Hollywood world.

2920
03:27:36,140 --> 03:27:38,900
Let me tell you, that isn't what Hollywood's like.

2921
03:27:38,900 --> 03:27:44,560
You can't keep me far, I'm not bragging, I get invited, not in as much as I used to.

2922
03:27:44,560 --> 03:27:54,260
But I get invited to behind the scenes, huge world events, world concerts.

2923
03:27:54,260 --> 03:28:02,260
You know, sky boxes at Formula One with the top five world rock band and he constantly,

2924
03:28:02,260 --> 03:28:04,580
and it's not that I'm against those people, they're listeners.

2925
03:28:04,580 --> 03:28:08,380
They wanna, maybe I should go meet with them and stand around all fancy with bodyguards

2926
03:28:08,380 --> 03:28:09,380
and preen.

2927
03:28:09,380 --> 03:28:13,300
I mean, I guess that is success, but that is not what I'm into.

2928
03:28:13,300 --> 03:28:18,860
And not because I don't like status, I want status amongst thinkers.

2929
03:28:18,860 --> 03:28:21,540
I want status amongst strong men and women.

2930
03:28:21,540 --> 03:28:29,380
I want status amongst artists, not to be a peacock, but I want to influence them because

2931
03:28:29,380 --> 03:28:37,500
I have a vein of primal human liberty that I want to infect people with.

2932
03:28:37,500 --> 03:28:45,780
You understand, I don't just wanna have 15 children because I'm vain and like siring

2933
03:28:45,780 --> 03:28:46,780
children.

2934
03:28:46,780 --> 03:28:49,020
I want life, I wanna live forever.

2935
03:28:49,020 --> 03:28:53,580
I wanna hug them and train them and see the electricity in their eyes.

2936
03:28:53,580 --> 03:28:58,980
And I want their great, great grandchildren to be on Alpha Centuris, living to be 1,000

2937
03:28:58,980 --> 03:29:02,940
years old, doing things that the eye has not seen or ear has not heard.

2938
03:29:02,940 --> 03:29:09,860
I want to live, I want to produce, I want to let it all hang out.

2939
03:29:09,860 --> 03:29:13,820
I don't wanna run around in some primitive monkey behavior and sit up on the top of the

2940
03:29:13,820 --> 03:29:18,180
highest part of the tree like a chimpanzee with, I mean, you'll see arrogant chimpanzees

2941
03:29:18,180 --> 03:29:22,820
or baboons acting just like humans sitting up there cuz the top one will sit there just

2942
03:29:22,820 --> 03:29:27,000
lounge like a king, I'm in charge.

2943
03:29:27,000 --> 03:29:33,420
That doesn't do anything for me, spacecraft, mathematics, art, beauty, that into the next

2944
03:29:33,420 --> 03:29:35,220
level is what I want.

2945
03:29:35,220 --> 03:29:41,620
I wanna see you win, the globalists wanna see you fall, I mean, it's real simple.

2946
03:29:41,620 --> 03:29:44,980
The government is not your friend, it's cancer.

2947
03:29:44,980 --> 03:29:48,340
Get the video at Infowars.com, get it out to everybody, the gun grabber video is now

2948
03:29:48,340 --> 03:29:49,860
up there right now.

2949
03:29:49,860 --> 03:30:18,860
On the march, the empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
