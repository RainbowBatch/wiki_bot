Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
Ladies and gentlemen, get ready, because this is going to be a power pack transmission.
The first Friday transmission of 2013. It is the fourth day of January 2013, and we're
gonna be live here for the next three hours, Lord willing. Gerald Cilente hadn't been on
in about, I don't know, three weeks, always informative.
We're gonna get his take on Sandy Hook, the economy, the fiscal cliff, the government
funding Al Qaeda publicly in Libya and Syria, all of the craziness. Gerald Cilente is on
in the third hour. Larry Pratt popping in on short notice via cell phone will be joining
us to give us the latest on Dianne Feinstein's new bill that has gun confiscation in it and
is getting almost no attention.
The Illinois bill that only has today to pass, and they claim they're not gonna try to pass
that they lost the votes they needed. But look out, that could be a playing possum event.
I've seen this more than once. They claim they're like ten votes short. They had the
votes they needed just two days ago. You shot it down. I've gotta give infowars.com radio
listeners credit.
I gotta give drudgereport.com credit. I gotta give the NRA credit and governors of America
and just all of you. We did a great job. They had the votes and they now are freaking out
that they couldn't ban them. I mean, it banned everything but bolt action rifles, pump shotguns,
pump rifles, semi autos, revolvers. They have the foid cards in Illinois, so you're registered
would have made you turn them in.
That's why we don't want registration in the other states cuz they always use them to try
to confiscate and everywhere else in the world are successful. That's why the new bill that
Feinstein's introduced has shut down the gun shows, shut down being able to give your grandson
a firearm, shut down being able to buy your dad a firearm.
We all buy each other firearms, don't we? At least I know my dad's probably bought me
four or five firearms in my life or more, I've bought him four or five firearms. The
point is, is that give each other knives, bows, hunting jackets, I mean, it's what men
do.
Well, not anymore according to these people. And it just absolutely registers all other
gun owners. You have to take guns you've already legally bought and go in like you're a criminal
and be fingerprinted. That has been introduced. And it hadn't shown up in thomas.loc.gov as
of this morning, but they say they've introduced it.
So we're gonna be tracking that kind of like on Wednesday, they said they introduced the
bill in the State House in Illinois, but we couldn't find it. And then it got defeated
yesterday and now it's popped up in the registry today. And it's exactly what the NRA said
was in it from their sources in the legislature that were able to get an advance copy.
So they're gonna try to sneak bills in and pass them same day. They're gonna try to keep
you from seeing the bills. And they can try to attach this gun grab bill to debt ceiling
increases. They can try to put it into defense spending, you name it, you name it. So we're
facing a lot of big issues here. Obviously, I'm not gonna make a big deal out of it.
But we are gonna do a general article about Al Jazeera, Russia Today, BBC, Piers Morgan
on CNN. All these foreign media outlets and foreign governments calling to take our guns
and our free speech. And so, I mean, RT really, I saw a video that they did yesterday, really
trying to defame me.
And it was just so pathetic, I don't know if I'll respond to it. I mean, they know we
have a bigger audience domestically than they do, so it's an attempt at that. But RT the
last eight months has really taken a turn towards authoritarianism and is shameful.
But I mean, I go on any media outlet, it's like Dave Stills, Piers Morgan's producers
trying to get me to fly to New York. I told them no. No, I was flown to New York once
to be on a television show and it was canceled. That's why I don't do that. I said, I'll do
satellite and they said, okay, we'll do satellite.
I'd like to be in studio with him, I just don't have the time or the energy and I'm
not going there to be chumped. I've been in the car more than ten times driving to a satellite
uplink when CNN has canceled it when I'm in the car, almost like it's a joke to mess with
me and waste my time.
And they send a car to make sure you're gonna be there. So you're driving in the car, got
some guy chauffeuring you, it's just all ridiculous. But the point is, I'm gonna go on CNN, doesn't
mean I agree with CNN. People say, why do you go on RT? Well, I mean, I go anywhere
to get the truth out.
It's my message that counts. We'll be right back. Alex Jones here with a very important
announcement for truth seekers. We've carried a lot of amazing films and books over the

Remember all I'm offering is the truth, nothing more.
The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
Ladies and gentlemen, it is Friday, the fourth day of January 2013. I am your host Alex Jones,
the head of governors of America with the latest attacks as we track the defense of
the republic against the globalist Larry Pratt will be popping in at the bottom of the hour,
Gerald Salonte in the third hour today. We will have open phones as well.
Okay, where to begin? There is massive harassment going on. You've seen it in the media saying
all gun owners helped kill children. So you are child killers. You're also Klan members
and you're also racist and you're also hateful. And Michael Moore, MSNBC, literally you've
seen it dozens of places say white people are bad and guns are bad.
So the only thing worse than white people is guns. And we had people calling in yesterday,
one lady who said she was Hispanic and she said the problem is white people. So the media
with their dumbed down Obama heads is really having an effect. You're like, that doesn't
make any sense saying white people are bad and they own guns and let's get the white
people and get their guns.
With folks that have been indoctrinated into race based lib tyranny, lib tarred tyranny
as they call it. For them, you really are guns are racist. Because you can't take responsibility
for the gang banger culture, people killing each other. It's got to be a white person's
fault. And again, folks, we try to bring people together under liberty and under the Constitution,
under family, under God, under private property, all the things that make you healthy, wealthy
and wise.
But the system really is pulling out all the stops to demonize gun owners. Here's a headline
out of NBC and they report this like it's a good thing. Lawmakers propose publicizing
gun owners names. And you already saw the newspaper in New York, the Journal News publish
where they live and the guns they have by getting the records from the state where they
make you registered.
Now they know that causes people to be robbed. In fact, newspapers have done this for decades.
They always get sued over it and stuff, but they hate gun owners so much that they terrorize
you and say John Smith or Tom Hernandez or Carol Scott. I mean, these are random names
I'm throwing out. They live at this address and they've got nine permits for guns and
thieves go and rob them.
Now there haven't even been threats, but because of complaints by thousands of gun owners and
threats of lawsuits, the newspaper has hired armed guards after publishing gun owners address.
And of course, that came out days ago. What's amazing now is in Connecticut and other states,
the lawmakers are saying, let's give newspapers cover since they can't terrorize, I mean,
Hitler did this.
He would publish by law under regulations by 35, he started doing this, he got in at
33, where Jews lived and the businesses they had. So all armed thugs, brown shirts, quasi
government like TSA could come and knock out your windows and burn down your business.
And there's famous Nazi film reels of that for folks that tonight went on, they were
very proud of it. And they'd come and paint the star on your business or throw furniture
through the windows.
And then a year later they said, for your safety, cuz everybody's beating you up and
you can't pay your property tax. We want you to, yeah, Germany had property tax for we
did as a feudal state, going back to feudalism. German slaves, white slaves were not released
until the 1860s. But the media never tells you about that cuz then it can't be a black
white thing over slavery.
Germans were actual slaves in many areas, but it wasn't even called Germany. It was
Germania in general, Austrian Hungarian Empire, and had 77 sub counties with 14 major districts,
but you can go look up all that up for yourself. That people won't believe it, you type year,
the German serfs were free, the German slaves were freed.
And it was from the 1840s through the 70s, I just said the 1860 cuz that was the main.
And that was another reason over here people were saying, we gotta free slaves here too.
In Poland, they're freeing the slaves, in Germany, they're freeing the slaves. But I'm
digressing ladies and gentlemen, they can't terrorize gun owners properly.
And so now they wanna make it the law that you've got guns so people can rob you and
so you can be hated like you're a sex offender. It's like publishing, in fact, they said that,
they said, we wanna publish your names like you're sex offenders. And there's a special
report that Melissa Melton and Jakari Jackson are going to be putting out on the Nightly
News tonight, for Infowars Nightly News, 7 o'clock Central, about a 15 minute report
into all the mainstream news.
Last week it was The Economist, yesterday it was Vanity Fair, Huffington Post, literally
scores of major publications, the same talking point, repeal the Second Amendment. So we're
gonna be going over that. Now before they said the Second Amendment doesn't mean you
have a right to own guns. Now they just say, you know what, you're right, we lied about
that, you do have a right, we're gonna repeal it.
And they're not playing games. Now here's the good news, two days ago the local, we've
had them on many times, great patriots, we should get them back on. The Illinois Rifle
Association, a subgroup of the NRA, but they're hard chargers. The main NRA could learn from
them. They got the subsections of the bill from a legislator before it was introduced
and were able to head it off at the pass, because they had the votes.
They had more of the votes than they needed, and it's now being reported on. I have the
articles here, they're up at infowars.com. They had the votes, the local papers are reporting.
And because of tens of thousands of phone calls and people going to the State House
and visiting their legislatures, the Democrats caved in for now. Now they do, they could
be playing possum.
They've still got today in the legislative session to get that done, but here's Kurt
Nemo's article that links to the mainstream articles. Illinois Democrats lose bid to pass
firearms confiscation bill. So some good news, because even Chicagoland run by the Don Rahm
Emanuel and run by the Obama gangster gang, they need that.
Because what they were proposing is what Feinstein is, ban almost all guns, make it turn them
in. That's in her bill. Talks about making you re-register, but also, or we may just
do a forced buyback. It's right there, and the funding for it. But it's a footnote written
by these lawyers.
So first they'll do it with people that say they have criminal records or whatever to
make it look reasonable, and then go after everybody. They're gonna pick you off at checkpoints.
I was talking to one of my law enforcement forces yesterday here in Texas, pretty high
level. They were saying, no, exactly what you're saying is what we're being told. If
it passes, we're just gonna set up these statewide checkpoints they're now announcing and search
everybody's cars.
They call them gang task force checkpoints. They just search you. Well, this is a semi-auto.
That's federal law, and then they call the feds and they come and arrest you. I mean,
we're talking paddy wagons of gun owners here. And you're like, well, I'll just bury my guns.
Well, that kills the gun culture. They don't want you shooting. They don't want money going
to the reloaders, going to the ammo producers.
They wanna freeze it out and then demonize it and hunt us down. That's why you don't
just bury guns and get ready to shoot gun confiscators. If you do that, you're falling
in the globalist's hands. We don't want a civil war. The globalists want a civil war.
They want police and military to be killed trying to confiscate our firearms. And remember,
Alex, you're a fair monger. They'll never try to get our guns. And I said, you watch,
there's gonna be mass shootings.
There's gonna be false flags. A month before Sandy Hook, I said, this is the season, get
ready. I'm seeing them roll out the propaganda now beforehand. Just like before Gulf of Tonkin
in 63 and 64, they're like, we need to go ahead and put troops in. They already had
tens of thousands of advisors. 6,000 already died from 60 to 64. We need to go in, we need
to go in.
They were already building up the pretext to then stage the Gulf of Tonkin that never
happened. Our ships were never attacked, that's now been declassified. It's the same thing.
Before 9-11, they're like, we're gonna be hit by terrorists and when we are, give your
rights up. And I was reading Rand Corporation public stuff where they said, soon we'll be
hit by large terrorist attack.
The PENAC documents with Dick Cheney were saying, there's gonna be a huge Pearl Harbor
event. Pearl Harbor killed 3,000, 9-11 did. And they said this catalyzing event, whether
real or manufactured, go read it, it's public, their own website. And they said down the
road we'll then use race specific bio weapons. But we've got to get the media to legitimize
their use.
I mean, it's like, whoa, and I've got to give our own globalist local paper, the Austin
American Statesman credit. They were the only national paper that I saw, big paper in the
country that actually did an editorial a week after. This was back in 2000 when the PENAC
document came out saying this is crazy.
Former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, he wasn't even vice president yet, this was in 2000.
He says use race weapons. I mean, folks, the stuff they write about, they think you're
totally stupid. They're like, Alex, don't fear monger about Dick Cheney and race weapons.
I mean, he wrote it in the September 20th, 2000, Rebuilding America's Defenses. I mean,
I just gave you the name of the paper, National Archives, you can pull it up in ten seconds.
Rebuilding America's Defenses, PENAC. And there's 25 authors total, but he is credited
with that paper.
I mean, it is a blueprint for 9-11. And you can say, Alex, come on, the government didn't
do 9-11. I didn't say the whole government, I said criminal elements, bare minimum, knew
and let it happen. I mean, that's been confirmed. Just like the government ran Al Qaeda against
the Russians, and then against the Serbs.
And then they ran Al Qaeda, of course, against, this is the pretext, to take our liberties.
And now they're running them against Libya and Syria on record and giving them missiles
and letting them kill people. And the media is saying it's a great, good, wonderful, wholesome
thing.
I mean, this is going on. Those things are real, whether you want to believe it or not.
Yeah, there it is. Rebuilding America's Defenses, Strategy, Forces and Resources for a New Century.
A report to the project, a New American Century, September 2000.
Yeah, the actual publishing day is September 20th. I mean, look, it's all there. They think
you're stupid. We're gonna have a big Pearl Harbor event and take everybody's rights.
And then now who they admit the target of all the 9-11 stuff is? Gun owners, conservatives,
returning veterans.
We have witnessed two terrible storms in the East, but we are still in the eye of the perfect
storm. The most devastating economic conditions since the Great Depression. America's worst
drought in agricultural history. And now the economic results of the presidential election.

No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now. No matter how hard you try, you can't
stop us now. We're the renegades, it is the time of age. Folks, here's an example of how
we can have victory. The globalists order police all the time. The police have all been
basically federalized for all intents and purposes in all the big departments at least
to go out and do things like set up a checkpoint, randomly search everybody's vehicles.
Doesn't matter if the courts have ruled over and over again, it's totally unconstitutional.
Serious felony crimes, they just exercise the power. Kind of like I was talking to one
of the crew members that after she had a baby and she already said no to vaccines, she woke
up with them jabbing a needle in her arm giving her a vaccine. And then they say, it's the
law, there is no law, they just do what they want.
They set the precedent and hide their actions in plain view. So more and more of the state
police in Texas pull you over, put gloves on, pull you over speeding, you name it and
shove their hands inside your body. And then we'll go to the next person, cuz why not?
They're already breaking the law. And the state police came out and defended it. Well,
because no one bought it, they went, okay, we'll suspend her with pay while there's a
lawsuit. But the head of the DPS defended it, first her local commander defended it.
I mean, these are crazy people, crazy people. I'm not saying the average person in the state
police is a crazy person, but I've lived in Texas my whole life, born here. State police
were all really nice when I was a kid, a teenager, even the last 15 years ago, protesting things.
They're different now, bugging their eyes out at you, coming over and saying, you can't
film on the grounds of the Capitol. Just making it up and going, okay, go ahead and arrest
me.
And then they go, I'm getting my commander and then, well, and then a nice one walks
over and goes, well, yeah, they're allowed to film, what's going on? We have that on
tape with Aaron Dykes. They're hiring goons. And they're gonna phase out the good guys
and the good women and they're gonna come and stick their hands in our bodies. I mean,
and if you don't like it, they'll taser you or shoot you. They're crazy people.
Because the globalist wants to dominate, but here's the good news. People got so upset
that now the state police are like, well, we'll have to review this then. It's a power
grab. And I'm telling you, if you let government just tell you what to do, in every case, they'll
start saying, all right, show up on Saturdays to dig ditches.
It's part of your compulsory national service. By the way, Rahm Emanuel as White House chief
of staff, it's in my film Martial Law. It's in my film Fall of the Republic, excuse me.
He says on C-SPAN and on another show, he says, we're gonna have compulsory national
service.
You're gonna come out a few months out of the year and you're gonna serve the government.
And they've got all the proposals. You're gonna dig ditches. But they're gonna first
collapse society and say, here's your government card with money. Here's your government housing.
But you've gotta go out and do work now. You've gotta go out and pick up trash on the highway.
And people are like, well, good, make welfare people work. You don't get it. They wear these
red uniforms now, these red jackets through AmeriCorps, FEMA Corps, all these different
groups that we cover.
You've seen the video where they're marching and they're doing the dance going, salute
Obama. Obama's gonna give us free healthcare. Obama's gonna take over. Obama is our commander.
And you're like, well, those people are a bunch of dumbed down goons, so what? Doesn't
matter, folks, a wall of those people, just like the Soviet Union, will overrun you.
And they've got the Boy Scouts training for gun confiscation, all of this. I mean, this
is freakazoid level. But see, I'm here pointing out this is all freakazoid. They're like,
come on, don't fear monger.
Show Texas is announcing statewide checkpoints to see if you're a gang member. They set up
a checkpoint on the highway, pull you out of your car, photograph you, search your vehicle
at a warrant. I mean, come on, that's not a big deal. First, it was Alex, you're a fear
monger that checkpoints are coming to search everybody.
Then they come with TSA checkpoints as well. They're like, okay, well, you're a fear monger
not liking it. You're a fear monger, Alex, nobody's ever gonna come for our guys. Nobody's
gonna try to physically make you turn them in. Now they've got the bills introduced all
over the place. All right, well, you're a fear monger, now I wanna turn them in, you
don't need those guns.
Hey, here's the New York Times calling for world government and global carbon tax. Well,
you're a fear monger not liking that. I thought I was a fear monger, it didn't exist. No,
you're a fear monger, it's a good thing. Hey, I don't like foreign media, British, Russian,
Chinese now on US cable systems, just saying turn our guns in and get rid of free speech
and stuff.
They're like, shut up, what's wrong with having foreign media tell you to turn your guns in?
That's normal. Even USA Today and Paul Watson to an article on this came out yesterday and
said, what's with Al Jazeera saying turn our guns in? What's with Russian TV saying turn
our guns in?
I mean, every show now, and then see, I don't like it. And so the Russian TV comes out and
says, Alex Jones just in it for money, and he's a fear monger, those are quotes. What,
I mean, I don't get my money from Putin, so I'm bad. I get my money from you that buy
our good products.
See, we're bad for being Americans. And we're like sex offenders here. Our names get published
in the newspaper. And I'm like, hey, this is really dangerous. People are getting robbed
and stuff. Shut up, fear monger. So we're saying you're a Klan member cuz you own guns.
We're going to publish your name in the newspaper. We're going to make you turn your guns in.
And we're setting up checkpoints to take them.
Here on the march, the empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

Command Center in the heart of the resistance. You're listening to the Alex Jones Show. Ladies
and gentlemen, we are back live coming up the third hour, always informative. He had
been on this in about three weeks, a lot to cover on the economy. Sandy Hook, the police
state, Gerald Cilente of Trans Research will be joining us.
We're gonna have open phones in the second hour and a ton of geopolitical and economic
news. Joining us for the next 20 minutes or so is Larry Pratt, executive director of Gun
Owners of America, gunowners.org. And if it wasn't for Larry Pratt and Gun Owners of America
and the members, we would have already lost the Second Amendment. And if it wasn't for
them, the NRA wouldn't have been kept honest.
The NRA is better than they were ten years ago. But Larry has been forced before to point
out they were founded by the federal government after the Civil War and actually supported
the 68 Gun Control Act. But keeping our gun lobbies honest, never had to do that with
Gun Owners of America, perfect record. Keeping the other groups honest is key, key to not
let Benedict Arnold sneak in.
We've had some big victories in Illinois, they can still sneak it back in today. But
it is a big victory, they had the votes two days ago. But gun owners physically went there
to their offices and called by the tens of thousands as local Chicago and other newspapers
report. Those stories are all up at infowars.com.
But here's some of the news, Connecticut town to burn violent video games. That's a little
too much like book burning, but how about you just don't let your kids play them? Lawmaker
proposes publicizing gun owners names, that's trying to terrorize us. That's kind of stuff
Hitler did. Illinois Dems pull measure to ban weapons, not enough votes.
Marine warns Feinstein, I will not be disarmed. I've said publicly, I'm just not turning them
in. Not registering, it's my line in the sand, done. Homeland Security buys another 200,000
hollow point bullets on top of the 1.6 billion they bought in the last 14 months. And that's
now over 12 times any previous one year purchase.
And it just goes on and on. That's all up at drudgereport.com. We've got reports up
at infowars.com as well that I'll go over once Larry leaves us here at the end of the
hour. But DHS buys 200,000 more rounds of ammunition, more people killed with hammers
and clubs than rifles. This is all info weapons, it's all truth.
Ram it down the enemy's throat. Put it out on Facebook, Twitter, email, local talk radio,
don't stop. We can use their attack to actually have a counter offensive and may actually
route the gun grabbers to a great extent and shut the door on them. Won't be the first
time in history a major offensive turns into a route against an enemy.
Democide, how many people will government kill this year? Has an incredible video we
produced giving the history of government killing 290 plus million, I kept saying 260
million in the 20th century. Crass Obama photo op exploits Sandy Hook massacre, proven that
it's staged photos dealing with the dead kids.
Just incredibly evil along with his fake crime. Government democide and disarmament, the greatest
threats to just a bunch of key videos, articles up at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com. But
Larry Pratt joins us here today to talk about a host of issues. First off, I wanna get into
Dianne Feinstein and her bill, where she actually says forced buyback and or forced registration,
what's happening there?
How much trouble we're in? But then Chicago and Illinois being their model, going for
almost a total ban there. How big a deal is it that we've shot that down for now? Larry
Pratt, executive director, gun owners of America. It's good to be with you.
Good to be with you, sir. Well, they're gonna try and what I have to say is I wish there
were guys on our side that would be as tenacious and in the face of tough fights and willing
to just keep the battle going even if there isn't that much chance of success at the moment.
And that's the way I see Feinstein. She probably can't get something out of the Senate, let
alone the House, but that doesn't keep her from stopping because she understands that
if you don't keep the debate going, you're not gonna be able to eventually change the
terms of the debate. And that's one reason why our answer to the massacre in Newtown
was not just an armed guard, which frankly we think would be, well I guess it's better
than nothing, but it's very expensive and it means that there would be an identifiable
person that would presumably be the one person with a gun at a school. And if somebody wants
to commit mass murder, begin with the armed guard that's identified as the armed guard
carrying the gun presumably right out there on the hip like armed guards almost always
do. And once he's down, or she's down, then it's Katie Barr the door on the rest of them
and once again you're forced to wait for some 20 minutes until the police are able to get
there. Now the better solution would be to encourage everybody on staff at these schools,
no matter whether they're teachers or administrators or support like janitors, whatever it might
be, and any parent that might be visiting, if you're qualified for concealed carry, you
all come and you're welcome to come with your gun.
Right now that's illegal. That is so stuck on stupid.
Because the mass shooters, you're gonna break the law, they're ready to kill kids. All you
do is keep the law abiding citizens out. Well, what about Harold ISD that in 2007 used the
state law to arm more than 10 teachers. That way somebody's always there, multiple people,
and on the one in a billion chance a teacher went crazy, there'd be other teachers.
A crazy teacher could already sneak a gun in. It's kind of like not arming the pilots.
You trust them with a 100 ton weapon that's thousands of times more deadly than a gun,
but you don't trust them with a gun when these are about the most proficient people with
machinery and equipment and tools out there.
And in a situation where you've got a mass murder underway to complain that the teacher
may not be professionally trained, excuse me, even when the shooter was, all these mass
shootings are done at very close range. And so self-defense is not something that requires
Annie Oakley.
It simply requires that a good guy has a gun.
Well, I mean, the so-called left always implies that women can't shoot, which is incredibly
sexist. You know in shooting competition, women are as good or now statistically in
the Olympics better than men.
Hey, listen, I hate to admit it, but they pay attention better than most of us men and
they learn better. It's not something that we can disregard. And the fact is, look at
what that one brave woman did. I guess she was a teacher, Victoria Soto.
She had the presence of mind to hide away the kids and then she was out running where
she became a target. Why not have her have a gun, for goodness sake?
Oh, imagine what she would have done.
She's got the presence of mind to use it. Well, here's the issue. They know that the
gun culture was the bedrock of the Republic along with the First Amendment, free speech,
and that it was growing and becoming very popular, so they're striking back now.
But expanding on that, they know when there's another mass shooting and the way they're
advertising it, there will undoubtedly, unfortunately, be some copycats. So we're in a race to get
the teachers armed now, but they know when there's the next shooting that if they can
just get them registered now, like she wants, then she'll be able to physically get them
like her and Cuomo are trying and like they've tried in Illinois.
What's your breakdown on that, Larry?
Well, that's why I think it's really important that our side not be simply playing defense.
I mean, there are times when you can't do anything, but even now, we can be talking
about the 20 years of insanity that have led to the same result, and we keep expecting
a different result every time. We create a gun-free zone, and oh, how could that person
go and shoot all those people? Well, hello? We put up a sign that said, free firing zone
here, come on over. I mean, they're like magnets for the scum. These people are evil.
They're not stupid. And yet, by contrast, look what happened, and maybe some of, although
your listeners are better informed than almost anybody, but still, there wasn't very much
attention given to what happened at the Clackamas Mall outside of Portland three days before
Newtown. There, a guy had brought a gun into the mall, which was posted no guns, which
they can do under state law, even if you had a concealed carry, and he killed two people,
wounded another. Hearing that, a good guy with a gun, I'll presume that he didn't see
the posting of no guns, ran to the sound of the shots, which in itself is quite remarkable.
It was seen by the shooter as the shooter was unjamming his gun, so instead of getting
to kill any more people, nobody having rushed him during the time he was fiddling with his
gun, he then committed suicide because he saw the good guy with a gun. And my guess
is that we're not going to have any prosecutions of the good guy, because that wouldn't look
too good on the prosecutor's resume.
Larry, we have the UN treaty coming up in March that they wanna ram through the Senate,
and in it, and in the original State Department memorandum 7277, it states that once they've
disarmed the people, then they're going to disarm our military and only allow there to
be brigades and units assigned to the UN and NATO.
We already now have the spectacle last year in 2012 of three different congressional hearings
where the committees were told that NATO and the UN was commanding Obama to launch these
wars and that Congress was not involved in war making or military operations now. I mean,
just over the top unconstitutional treason. And this is about guns. Feinstein in a speech
last week said, well, in a letter she put out, she said, well, this is embarrassing
worldwide that we own guns.
And even the New York Times has said, foreign governments don't like us owning guns, we
need to get rid of them, it's embarrassing. But here's USA Today, their columnist in the
article reports for all the complaints about the leftward tilt in American journalism,
it's nothing compared to news operations around the globe.
Piers Morgan points to a bigger issue, and it says, why is Russian TV broadcast here
in the US transmitted? Arab News, Al Jazeera, you name it, BBC, Piers Morgan, why are the
Chinese government, why are they calling for our guns? And why does our media give this
attention and act like it's legitimate? I'm now being criticized by Russian TV because
I'm pro-gun.
I mean, no one would ever put up with this, but this really is this globalization. And
I think that if we get the word out to gun owners through GOA and others, and I'm putting
an article out with Watson today, pointing out that foreign governments and media are
telling Americans what to do. I think this could really backfire on them if we push this
information because it's just outrageous. Your take on that?
It's very outrageous. Almost immediately after Newtown, the Chinese perhaps were the first
ones in the chorus to start singing this anti-American, anti-Second Amendment song, calling for too
many guns in the United States, blah, blah. Well, of course, there would be too many guns
from their point of view because we would use our guns to shoot the very people like
them, who would ever attempt any kind of government like the communist dictatorship in China being
imposed here in the United States.
It makes them nervous to think that there's any place in the world where the people are
trusted with guns.
Yeah, they're tyrants, they're tyrants. I mean, the communist Chinese official People's
Daily and their TV came out and said, Obama, we support you, quote, wage a war on the Second
Amendment. Foreign governments saying wage war on us and Obama's doing it.
Yeah, not that he really needed any encouragement, but I guess they can't resist it. They are
so offended. I mean, there are lots of things that I'm offended about. Communist China,
thugocracy, Russia, on down the list.
Suicide nets, forced abortions, yeah.
Yeah, yeah. But I don't expect my government to be making a big deal about it unless, well,
and maybe if we stop trading with them and started treating them the way they should
be, we could be the kind of thing to talk about. So we'd have in mind what kind of people
they are. But, you know, I don't tell the Chinese what kind of food to eat and I don't
expect them to tell me anything about freedom because they obviously don't understand or
care to know anything about freedom. It's certainly not their government that was issuing
this offense.
Well, that's a good point. Just 20 years ago, our government would criticize China for its
criminal activity. Now they won't do it because our government is adopting their policies.
Exactly.
Well, Larry, I mean, even USA Today, Piers Morgan points to bigger issues. They point
out that it is our own media piling up with foreign governments and foreigners who are
flooding the social media lobbying to take our guns. This is really, it'd be sedition
if they were citizens, this is subversion, but we're so accustomed to it, we don't even
call it that.
I call it subversion to have Russian and Chinese media published in this country saying take
my rights. That is outrageous.
And I guess the silence that is kind of deafening is the silence of our government not telling
the Chinese that we really don't need their comments about a free society since they obviously
don't understand freedom. That's about as polite as I'm putting it.
No, no, our media says we've got to do it because they say so. It's incredible. Dianne
Feinstein says that. What do you expect them to try to do, not just with her bill, but
others? What's the timeframe? Obama said yesterday his priority is open borders and gutting the
Second Amendment. What's your battle plan?
There's a bunch of anti-Second Amendment bills in. I don't expect them to be successfully
pursued either in the Senate or the House. What we have seen is that yesterday and now
today, two bills pretty much the same have been filed to do away with gun-free school
zones. And I think that's terrific. Congressman Stocklin was the first one in, and he has
taken the offensive. He's not talking about, oh, you shouldn't be taking our semiautomatic.
Well, of course they shouldn't. We know that. But what we should be doing is working to
get rid of the invitation that's posted around every school for mass murder. No guns beyond
this point. This is a gun-free zone. Sure it is. That's just insanity. And that's defined
as repeating the same thing and expecting a different result each time.
And if they want to believe something like that, that's fine. But as for the rest of
us, we've got to say, no, we're not playing by those rules.
I agree. We've got to get on the offense and point out that it's the government and the
liberals, the tyrants, because they're not really liberals, creating the gun-free zones
and advertising it. That is absolutely responsible for this.
And then they want to blame us gun owners after they created the zone that was the shooting
fish in the barrel zone. For those that don't know, more than 10 bills
have now been introduced in Congress. How many do you expect to be introduced before
this session is up? It'll be a lot. But I think there's going to be some even more coming
from the good guys.
And those have a chance because even as Senator Coburn put a measure on a spending bill, it
was a credit card bill, actually a horrible bill, but he knew it was going to pass because
the president really wanted it. And he was able to get the long time ban on guns in national
parks done away with. He took a house measure, put it on an amendment to a spending measure,
finance measure, and off it went. The president signed it.
No, no, you're right. Instead of defending against him, we do that 50%, the other 50
offense to get them off balance. I'm going to talk about more ways to get on the offense
in our final segment with Larry Pratt, executive director of Gun Owners of America. Get over
there and join it today and get the free alerts.

and more opposition because we're having an effect. Now, Gunners of America Chairman Larry
Pratt is with us.
It's also important to join gun owners, or at least sign up for the free email alerts
up to the minute on the gun grabs. You can defend the Republic. We're having victories
like in Illinois yesterday. Moving fast, why not get on the offense too, sir, with bringing
up Fast and Furious? Hey, Obama, why don't you cry for all the dead Mexican kids you
killed shipping guns into Mexico?
The idea that guns need to be banned in the United States, such as Diane Feinstein and
other members of Congress are proposing, and not a word about having armed the Mexican
cartel thanks to a United States government program, Fast and Furious. These people, they
understand staying on offense. You catch them red-handed and all they tell you is, so do
you believe me? Are you lying eyes?
Oh, I mean the incredible amount of lying. What has it done though where they denied
they wanted our guns all these years when we had their own publication saying they want
total abolition, that now they're out in the open. I see this if we seize the moment, totally
blowing up in their face and reversing everything they've done.
I think so too. I've had that sense that maybe my good friend Piers Morgan, I maybe haven't
told you, but I'm thinking of setting up a fan club and I'll be the head of it. He brought
us more new members than we've had in a long time at one time. I think that so has outraged
people and frankly, I think it showed some, when I've talked to other conservative groups
in Washington, it really encouraged them to realize that we don't have to just sit there
and be sort of a captive, tied to a chair and take our beating.
Exactly. These fake liberals aren't liberals, they're authoritarians, call them authoritarians
and don't let them sit in the position of authority, in fake moral authority and always
put us on the defense and tell us we're child killers when they're the child killers. I
mean, if we're child killers, they're 10 times the child killer.
Yeah, well, first of all, we don't support abortion, most of us. There's a big exemption
right there. And a lot of children get killed in the genocides of dictatorial governments
all around the world. And the pattern was very clear. The guns and other weapons were
collected first before the real killing got started.
We've got an article up at Infowars.com that has a special video we did, Larry, exposing
democide governments killing 290 plus million people in the last century after gun control.
And it's got all the proof and all the facts. Very important to get that out to people.
In closing, in the one minute we have left, anything else you want to warn people about?
Oh, during the break, you said executive orders. He may still do that, though.
That is a real problem. He could simply say, you can't buy a handgun over a certain caliber
and on up and you can't buy a long gun if it takes a detachable magazine. That would
be illegal, it would be unconstitutional, but that doesn't seem to be a problem for
this president. And we'd eventually beat him in court, but the dealers would have no choice
but to comply because if he pulls their license, they're out of business that second.
That's right.
That's quite a barrel to have us over.
You know, I just thought of something. We need a gun owners, a gun shop union so that
they can stand up to the ATF because you know how brutal they are to nice mom and pops,
you name it. I mean, they really are gangsters because I've experienced them repeatedly.
And people I've never been around feds that act like people out of Goodfellas. I mean,
tell you, the ATF is a joke. Larry Pratt, thank you so much. Gun owners of America.
Thank you, sir. We'll talk to you again soon. Have a great weekend.

Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex
Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
Aaron Dykes here on January 1st, 2013. Now, Alex Jones talked on the show today about
how the system views us as human resources. And this is happening more and more under
the eugenics model, more and more here in the United States as we adopt Obamacare, as
we move towards a planned economy where there's limited economic options and less and less
freedom all the time. Now, I just want to point out they really do consider us human
resources. I'm going to play you a clip from a 1974 family planning clip called Communicate,
Speak, They Are Listening. Family planning is, of course, code for eugenics. It's the
softer side of Sears, the softer side of eugenics. Let's go to that clip right now.
In Kenya, the Minister of Finance and Development offers valuable support. Well, my views, which
really are government views, is that family planning is an integral part of development
planning. It is an essential part for the reason that you cannot hope to plan other
forms of production if you cannot plan the production of the main resource, human beings.
We view it as an aspect of human freedom. Incredibly, you see this Finance and Development
claim that it's the state's role to decide how many people reproduce, who and when, because
they are human resources, part of the overall planned economy system, which time and again
leads to limited freedom and basically totally slavery. But on top of that, you see this
incredible 1984 Orwellian backwards doublespeak where freedom is slavery. Somehow when the
state tells you if you can breed or not, that's freedom from the natural restrictions on breeding
that otherwise occur. So that is not slave to just natural forces. And this is what I
said in Swahili to these people, that we view family planning education as an extension
of personal liberty. And you can find that film in the National Archives, signing off
for Infowars.com. And there is just one of the little nightly news vignettes that are
turned out every night. Infowars Nightly News some days is like three hours long. Usually
it's about an hour and a half. Soon it will go to an hour with a few commercial breaks
so that it can be put out on cable and television systems.
It already is. We're already very thankful to cable systems overseas and domestically
that pick it up, edit down the high def file the next day and air it on cable systems.
It's great for folks with access television shows around the country too to pick out special
reports, things you like from prisonplanet.tv and then put it out in your area. Because
the truth is so much more powerful than lies, a thimble of truth trumps a bucket of lies.
And the globalists are discredited now, they're in trouble. They've got a bunch of brain numbed,
tranced out, drugged out zombies that follow them, that giggle at you. I mean, they're
victims. I mean, if you pull up and there's a homeless person who's obviously schizophrenic,
been on drugs their whole life, bombed out of their brain.
And they're going, you're the devil, you're the devil or talking to themselves. You don't
get mad. Now, if your neighbor who you've been friends with for 20 years came over and
said you're scum, you're the devil, you might get offended because that's someone who is
you thought cognitively together, or you'd be worried about them.
But it doesn't hurt my ego at all when a victim laughs at me. Or when these even establishment
media people following the same old laundry list scripts try to attack us with buzzwords
and stuff. Because we have the thinkers, they have the stinkers. We have the people that
understand history and are rugged and love liberty and they've got a bunch of losers.
So I for one know that liberty is on the march. You see, things are so dark, I saw some emails
going, Alex says we're on the march, the empire's on the run. The empire's on the march. Yeah,
but if we take the fight to them, we can use their offensive as a way to defeat them.

And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live and liberty lovers are back on the offense. We
have smashed the most draconian gun control legislation ever seen in the Midwest or even
in the West itself. Only New York City has trumped the almost total gun ban that the
entire state of Illinois was trying to ram through.
They were trying to take the Chicago-style gun ban and take it right through the entire
state of Illinois. And Illinois, I've been up there many times, have family that lives
up there, works in Chicago. There is no way that the farmers and ranchers and hardworking
people that live in the rural areas are turning their guns in.
And decades ago, they warned people in Illinois, and the people in Illinois warned the legislators.
They said if you ever register our guns, which they've done through the Floyd card, you are
simply going to allow the government to come confiscate legally owned guns. Cuz it's been
done all over the world and in the US and Canada.
And we've got Vanity Fair, we've got London Guardian, we've got Huffington Post, we've
got them all calling for the repeal of the Second Amendment. Here's the Vanity Fair headline.
Let's repeal the Second Amendment. Same thing out of London Guardian. Here's Huffington
Post, repealing the Second Amendment would make us better than this.
And again, that's George Soros connected Huffington Post. I sit here and talk about Chinese media
that's on some cable systems here in the US, government controlled. And I talk about it
being foreign agents, clearly illegal, when they're engaged in our domestic operations.
They wouldn't put up with it. No government does that, no people put up with that. I talk
about Russia today. You can have foreign Russian government funded news, but when it starts
saying repeal the Second Amendment or open your borders up like they're doing or bring
in socialism, they're trying to cause a Russian revolution in this country.
And I'm too busy to monitor it, but because I was hearing from listeners it was happening,
so I started spot checking it. And man, they're tearing me down, they're tearing America down,
they're tearing constitutionalists down, they're tearing Ron Paul down now. I mean, it is bad
what's on Russia today, bad.
And it's worse than CNN or MSNBC now. And I guess for a while they operated and posed
as patriots to get an audience and are now doing this. But I mean, it's hard to deal
with. And people are like, well, let them have their First Amendment. Listen, if I went
to Russia and set up a media operation with $100 million a year, let's say I had that,
that's what RT gets roughly, one of the federal filings that are out there.
They would arrest me so fast it would make my head spin. And that's because Russia is
very authoritarian and getting more authoritarian, unfortunately. But the license would be revoked
even back a decade ago when Russia wasn't as authoritarian. They're taking the Iranians
license to be on cable away in England and in Europe. And by the way, Press TV is milquetoast
compared to even my show covering political issues.
And I get invited on Iranian TV, it's worldwide. So it's worthwhile to do cuz it's in English
and it's in cable systems all over the world. And I can go and talk about the New World
Order, the Second Amendment, liberty, freedom, whatever I want. And so it's my message. And
so even if those things are state run to a certain extent, it's my message getting out.
So I turned down going on Japanese TV or Brazilian TV or Iranian TV just cuz I'm too busy. And
Japanese TV and Iranian TV always want me to go down to a satellite uplink facility
downtown, which takes 30 minutes to go down there and then find parking.
And then, I mean, Austin's very metropolitan now, it's hard to find parking. Or it's outrageously
$10 to park for two hours. And then I gotta get in the building and go through security
and go through all the trouble and sit there for 30 minutes before and go on. I would do
RT because they do Skype, boom, turn it on, do 10 minutes, I'm done.
And it was almost a nuisance, so they wanted me on there every week. But I can talk about
the New World Order, the Patriot Act, the NDAA, Al Qaeda being government run. I could
really get some good done, so I'd do it. But I'd bad mouth Stalin and communism as well,
and they didn't like that.
And I haven't been on there in eight months, which is, again, no skin off my back. I've
just ignored it. I mean, I've been in New York before, supposed to go on Fox News and
they go, sorry, higher ups don't want you on now. Well, let's give blame where it's
due. It was Glenn Beck that time was throwing fits over it. The point is, is it's no sweat
off my back. I mean, it's not like, I get to go on television.
Like they say, I'm on Piers Morgan, the seventh when it gets back. If they cancel it, I'm
not even worried about it. In fact, I'm kind of lazy at night, that's fine. Not really
lazy, I get so tired, I don't care when stuff gets canceled. They're trying to get me to
fly up there right now. And I'm like, no, no, no, well, we'll give you three segments
if you do.
Right now you've got 12 minutes, we'll give you 16 minutes. And I'm like, no, just do
it via satellite, that way if you cancel it, I just drive home 30 minutes, I don't have
to miss my family. Cuz I only see him a few hours at night when I do, didn't even see
my children yesterday, except in the morning.
And I'm not complaining, it's just that I'm not criticizing RT now, because I haven't
been on there in eight months. Cuz some people are like, Alex, you go on RT, you must work
for Putin. And I'm like, no, it is state run, state funded, but they don't control what
I say. I'll go on there and talk about foreign banks taking the US over, but something changed
eight months ago.
And it's now come out in the EU, it was in the news last week. Hermann von Rompi, one
of the heads of the EU, the head of the commission, has been in meetings with Putin and others.
And they're gonna merge the European Union as a new Soviet, and even the president of
the Czech Republic has said this, but it's now official, with the old USSR. And they're
putting the hammers and sickles back on the tanks.
The old timers were right, Russia played possum. And so there were different policies just
a year ago. Now it is full bore, merged with Obama, the authoritarians uniting against
our Second Amendment. And I find it outrageous that you've got Al Jazeera, state run media
out of Qatar, on record, who even funds CNN, that's come out with the Amber Lyon news.
You've got other state run media funded directly by the Kremlin, on record, 100 million a year
on average, dollars, RT America. You've got BBC, you've got Piers Morgan over on CNN.
In fact, USA Today lists a whole bunch of others here, and points out why are foreign
governments and state run media calling for us to turn our guns in? Now granted, USA Today
will have like 15 anti-gun editorials for every editorial like this.
This is a good editorial by Dan Gaynor of the Boone Pickens Media Fellow, and vice president
of business and culture. I mean, he's saying, man, this is over the top, and it really is
over the top. I mean, the Japanese would not put up with an American, much less government
run.
Imagine if I showed up with 100 million US dollars a year, and set up a TV station in
Russia, or in Japan, or in Saudi Arabia, or in Brazil, or Mexico, anywhere. And started
telling them what to do and bad mouthing George Washington. Ladies and gentlemen, you wouldn't
have to have the government throw them out.
The people would go and physically throw you out, guaranteed. Bilderberg met two years
ago in Switzerland, a year and a half ago, and people showed up with torches to throw
them out. And a member of the EU Parliament went in and got beat up by police, and then
the police got orders to stand down.
So the Bilderberg group panicked and flew out on helicopters when presidents of three
cantons showed up. And the cantons are the states, but they actually run the federal
government there. So the equivalent of super senators showed up and said, you are to stand
down.
And helicopters, dozens of them landed, and the top Bilderbergs fled. And that actually
came out again in the news yesterday that indeed, they are freaked out and may not even
meet in Europe again next year, certainly never against Switzerland. Because the government
of Switzerland started turning against them and going, yeah, what are a bunch of foreigners
here trying to get rid of our sovereignty?
They were meeting, part of the agenda was how to get rid of Swiss sovereignty. The Swiss
aren't gonna put up with that, because they understand that's why they're wealthy and
powerful cuz they don't have foreign banks sucking off of them. And because the vampires
have sucked everybody else dry, they run to the one place they don't completely run to
live because they haven't polluted it with their policies.
Everybody's fleeing France to Switzerland right now, and Belgium for lower taxes. The
football stars, the soccer stars, as they're properly called, all of it. And so my issue
is, here's the talking points, cuz it's the facts, I go with the truth. We've got the
truth, we can destroy these people or at least make them back off, okay?
It's time to let RT and all of them know, and I knew this a few weeks ago, so they're
really attacking me now, which is great. I mean, you're such fools, America is totally
lining up behind me right now. I saw some of the votes on one of the videos, like 90%
in favor of us, when the Russian government starts attacking Alex Jones and the Second
Amendment.
Good, good, call me bad, call me evil, attack me, Russia, good. I'm not immoral like your
government. When the globalists tried to start a war with you in 2008, I was against it because
it was wrong morally. And I know America is run by foreign banks. I want my government
back.
I want my country back, and I don't want foreign banks taking my government over. I don't want
the Russian government manipulating my life. I don't want the Chinese government manipulating
my life. I don't like the Mexican government trying to dictate my life. I don't like the
federal government trying to run my life, okay? I'm a sovereign, I'm free. You got that?
I stand with the truth. I stand with what I really believe is morally right. I don't
sit there and try to manipulate my audience and use buzzwords on them over and over again
like Alex Jones the Fairmonger, Alex Jones the Fairmonger, Alex Jones the Fairmonger
like 10 times in one report.
You think that works? Everybody sees right through you, okay? You're not going to get
our guns, Russians. You understand that, Vladimir Putin? You're not going to destroy America.
You understand that?

Hi there. My name is Frank Bates. What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could
get me in a lot of trouble. I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com
that exposes the electricity monopolies and government agencies for what they really are,
incompetent line crooks that are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power
bills criminally high. Some have called this a conspiracy. Others have called it a cover-up
and you will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy goes. My video at 123coverup.com
exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them and how you can beat them
too. Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen
in the last three months. Go to 123coverup.com and discover one weird trick to slash your
power bill and protect your home. Go watch my video now at 123coverup.com before they
force me to shut it down. Again, that's 123coverup.com.
You're going to find out who's who right now. You're going to see people who claim they
were patriots, anti-New World Order, come out of the woodwork against info wars, against
yours truly, Alex Jones. You're going to see a foreign media come out against us as they're
doing all over foreign newspapers across Europe, across England, China, you name it.
They are attacking yours truly because they know that we are able to take basic facts
and hypocrisies and get them out to the public. And they see the articles we put out going
viral worldwide and hurting them.
The enemy has identified us as a key point. You're going to find out who's who now as
Europe lines up with Russia and Obama to set up a world government. The globalists are
bringing their system in right now. And the different alignments are being made in the
power structure. I ought to get Joel Skousen on, he is really smart when it comes to breaking
all this down. I concur with a lot of his analysis, but I'm really seeing, I want to
get what he thinks.
Give him a call. I know Cilentes coming up. See if he can come on for like five minutes
a day, but like an hour next week, just to give me his take on this Russia really snuggling
up to Obama right now. But that's a side issue. The point is that all of this is beginning
to unfold. All of this is beginning to accelerate.
And if we can beat Dianne Feinstein and her gun ban bill, if we can beat things like what
the Illinois legislature thought they had the votes to do, but we defeated, you defeated.
We're on like three affiliates in Illinois, including Chicago. If we're able to do this
together, and if we turn this around against them and then use this as a way to get more
guns into schools and more guns in the gun free zones, and then you're gonna have more
cases that were shooters going to kill people and get taken out.
There should be nowhere criminals and shooters are safe. I mean, you look at the higher gun
ownership in areas like Texas and Arizona, they don't have home invasions at anywhere
near the numbers of places like England where they've taken all the guns. England has triple
the violent crime rate that we have, look it up.
But our media lies and actually creates fake graphs, just like they tell you Israelis don't
have guns in school. You know they have guns in school, you can go to Haaretz or Jerusalem
Post, type in guns in Israeli schools, see articles going back over decades, see new
articles.
They lie to you, ladies and gentlemen. They think you're stupid because it's all they've
got. We've got the truth, they've got the lies. And you're going to find out who's who.
But also, people that have been on the fence for decades are suddenly coming out against
the New World Order, are coming out in support of the Second Amendment.
You're going to see who the good guys are right now as well. People you thought were
just milk toasters suddenly getting hardcore because they realize that now there's no hope
unless we get serious. That's it. We either get hardcore and stop playing games or it's
over.
And you know what, when we get hardcore, we win. When we get angry, we win. When we get
aggressive, we win. When we stand up and fight, we win. Fight against that? No, we will run
and we will live. Sure, fight and you may die, run and you'll live at least a while.
But someday, lying in your beds, you'll wish that you had done the right thing now and
could come back here and tell our enemies that you can take our lives, but you'll never
take our freedom. The globalists have done everything they can to gut our economy, sell
us out, globalize us.
The UN tells our military what to do, NATO tells us, foreign governments tell us what
to do, foreign media tells us what to do, illegal aliens come here. I don't hate them.
I hate how they're being used and get a free kidney, over $200,000, paid for by taxpayers
and Loyola together. And then the guy complained and said, it's not enough. I want all my other
immigrant friends to have free stuff.
You're only being given free stuff as an advertisement. Come to America, can have your baby for free.
Come to America, you can get a free kidney when citizens don't get that. And why is that?
To drive down the wages and implode us, just like the globalists use China to implode our
wages.
Doesn't help the Chinese people, they're worse off than they were. Suicide nets around the
factories forced abortions. Mexico's worse off than it was 20 years ago under NAFTA and
the UN down there forcing everybody off their land up to Mexico City to live like slaves.
I fight against that. I want the Mexican people to be wealthy and strong and to have freedom.
Because I want them to be free, but also doing the right thing, also intellectually is always
good for you.
Because then it would be a wonderfully wealthy, good, happy, productive place that would not
be a time bomb helping the globalists bring down America. You understand that, folks?
You can't have our neighbors to the south living in squalor and not have it implode
us. And let me tell you, bringing all those poor people up here is gonna implode us. It's
gonna flood our lifeboat, it's not gonna help them.
And the globalists know that, that's why they want our guns, they want open borders, they
want socialist healthcare for the state to run our healthcare. They're control freaks
that wanna run our lives. 800-259-9231, wide open phones, 800-259-9231, I'm Alex Jones
defending the republic, join me.

Tyranny is here. The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.

now being expanded nationwide. This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program
has established an all powerful shadow state. Police state four chronicles the sickening
depth to which our republic has fallen. Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency
dictatorship, body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on
every street corner.
It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan. The police state isn't coming.

Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live. And I think the one reason we've been successful
here, well, there's a lot of God's good grace, research, doggedness, but also the fact that
I'm naturally excitable when I'm dealing with tyranny. And we've been able to translate
that energy into others to get America moving out of our inertia, to get America understanding
we're under attack and to get people into the mindset of not just taking it but standing
up.
And big things have small beginnings. Once we start the ball rolling, it's very hard
to get it rolling, but now it's starting to roll. And I was thinking about it. They've
had Mexico, the Mexican president come out the last few years and say ban the Second
Amendment and blame crime in Mexico on it when they have a total gun ban down there.
And most of the violence is full auto stuff shipped in by big banks who've been caught
flying guns in, drugs out.
Major banks, it's all over the news, hand grenades, rocket launchers. The drug cartels
have tanks. They're not buying tanks from gun shops. Fast and Furious was staged to
blame the Second Amendment and it came out in the memo that they were gonna blame the
Second Amendment and blame the violence in Mexico for it and try to go after it.
Well even though they got caught, the White House still went forward with that. They were
going to have press conferences with the poor women talking about their dead children just
like they're doing Sandy Hook. But because it turned out they were the ones behind it,
they had to kind of back off halfway and it fizzled.
But right on time Sandy Hook happened. And I saw some more of the foreign media going
conspiracy theorists say that there were multiple shooters. Well, the media always
reports multiple shooters cuz little kids were seeing people and making the reports.
No, we've aired the newscast. It was helicopters and footage and surveillance cameras of multiple
guys in camo arrested out in the woods. It wasn't little kids filing these reports, there's
video of it.
And they said he had an AR-15 M4 inside and it was in the car. I mean, they staged Gulf
of Tonkin, our government staged mass shootings in Iran in 53 to blame it on Mohammad Mosaddegh
in mass shootings that they blamed on the government. Declassified, 1999, declassified.
Decades and decades later, led by Kermit Roosevelt, grandson of Teddy Roosevelt and MI6 and OSS.
Well, it turned into CIA by then. And Operation Gladio, where the Pentagon and NATO launched
hundreds of mass shootings and bombings in Europe to demonize their political opposition,
whether it be left wing or right wing, that's been declassified by the Italian Parliament.
Their operations with NATO. I mean, mass shootings are in Operation Northwoods, type in Operation
Northwoods.
Guys, will you do that PDFs at the National Archives and go in there and it says the Pentagon
would conduct mass shootings at shopping malls, at markets and on the streets and would shoot
Americans and blame it on the Cubans as a pretext to invade. But Kennedy said no. Bobby
liked the plan.
As much as people lionized Bobby Kennedy, he actually supported bombing the US Embassy
in Honduras as a pretext to invade and his brother overruled that as well. Kennedy's
weren't perfect by any stretch of the amount. By the way, that's all declassified, just
type in, I think it's like BBC, AP, you name it.
It's been declassified, it's not debatable. So when I see something like this right on
time and it has the earmarks, I'm like, yeah, they could have staged that. I mean, with
the Batman thing, people keep saying, why are we connecting this to Batman, mainstream
corporate foreign press and others?
It's not like we said Batman would be connected to shootings after it. We said before it had
clear triggers. And they mailed out these bane letters to media showing bane attack
points that name things like Sandy Hook and Hinkley, one of the shooters. And the Batman
shooter was in a government mind control program, that's in the Colorado newspapers, that he
was in a special DARPA defense program of brain interface with machines to take over
the cognitive abilities.
Thought helmets, like in the movies where they put the helmet on and it picks up your
brain waves. He was in a super advanced top secret Pentagon funded program with a top
Air Force psychiatrist as his handler. You wanna keep going about an hour and a half
here?
Cuz I mean, it just goes boom, boom, boom, boom. I don't know, maybe that is a coincidence.
Maybe it's a coincidence I said, I believe the Batman movie coming out will be a trigger
for bombings and shootings. I mean, I'm on record months before it came out, who put
out Batman?
Warner Brothers even tried to get our video taken off YouTube, breaking it down, tried
to claim copyright on it. We went and refiled and it's fair use, we were just exposing scenes
in the trailer. I said it's trying to invoke a subconscious blueprint for revolution. And
Bane symbolizes the Illuminati, fire goes up, and how they leak that beforehand.
See, these little brains of the New World Order think we're all stupid and don't see
what they're doing. All right, I said I'd go to your phone calls. The point is the globalist
are coming after the Second Amendment right now. And they're gonna come after the pension
funds and they're trying to set up all over the country you're hearing.
In California, in Oklahoma, in Virginia, in Tennessee, in Texas, the police are setting
up federally funded gang checkpoints where, let me see, you got any tattoos? Get out,
I don't wanna look at your tattoos. No judge, no jury, no probable cause, no reasonable
suspicion. Let me search your car.
By the way, we're gonna look for guns now. That's in the news. By the way, we're gonna
do a cavity search now. This is martial law. I'm not saying martial law is coming, martial
law is here. The police state isn't coming, the police state is here. That's the tagline
from Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA came out two years ago.
And I've got state reps and governors and army colonels on admitting gun confiscation
drills. Remember they had gun confiscation drills in Arcadia, Iowa, where they practiced
writing the local gun shop going door to door with the citizens taking their guns in a drill.
The town of 650, and I had the colonel on, he goes, well, yeah, we are doing this drill,
but what's wrong with that? And the media called me a conspiracy theorist. It said,
yeah, they're doing a gun confiscation drill, but Alex Jones is still a conspiracy theorist.
So it's like, well, yeah, we're doing the gun confiscation drill, but it's not like
he gets laurels thrown at him. You were right. Thank you for warning us. Let's stop this
nightmare. It's, no, he's bad.
Alex Jones said they were gonna start having the TSA on the streets. Now it's happening.
My gosh, man, you were right. Tell us more. It's like, you fair monger. Because that's
all they've got. But people aren't listening to them anymore. But they don't care. They're
arrogant. They're there in their big fancy CNN and RT and MSNBC facilities and they really
believe it.
When The View called me a few years ago and said, we want you to come here. And I said,
I wanna do it on satellite. They said, we don't do satellite. And I said, I know, I
just don't wanna do it. They said, you're kidding. You don't wanna do The View. I mean,
the president's wanna come on here. And I said, nope. And they said, listen, we'll pay
for your ticket, direct flight, everything.
And then a bunch of other media called to get me to New York. So I said, okay, I'll
come to New York. Cuz that way I figured they wouldn't cancel me cuz that was my concern.
I'm not gonna be chumped or schmucked into that. And then I go, well, I want first class
tickets, sir, I'm not going. It's ABC's money. They go, sorry, we never bought anyone first
class.
And I said, I'm not doing it. They go, we're calling your bluff. We're not doing it. You're
not on the show. I said, good, click. They call back, okay, we'll buy you first class
tickets. My point is, they hate it that I don't care about them. They absolutely cannot
stand it that I don't worship them.
And they hate the fact that you don't worship them anymore either. They hate the fact that
you're awake to their fraud. It's like the Emperor's New Clothes, I'm gonna go to your
calls. Do you know that old parable of these scammers end up coming to the king and they
say, we're gonna weave you the most fine linen, but only the most royal can see this gold
linen.
So they sit there for hours, imaginarily weaving. And he's royal, surely he could, so he thinks,
maybe I'm not royal. Maybe I'm an imposter, I better not say I don't see it. So they put
it on him and he goes out and he's in his underwear. He's not really wearing clothes.
But no one wants to say that the Emperor is naked. Well, finally, he gets totally naked
by the third garment and is in a parade naked and no one wants to say he's naked.
And finally, a three year old steps forward and laughs and says the Emperor has no clothes
and everyone dies laughing. And that's how this works with these people, okay? The Emperor
has no clothes. Laugh at them like you laugh at a rattlesnake that's rattling its rattle
at you when you've got space age technology and you know this rattler isn't gonna make
it.
You think I'm gonna reach down and let you bite me? No, no, no, I have a shotgun and
I'm talking about politically. I have a shotgun rattlesnake. I'm gonna step back about 20
feet. I'm gonna put a bead right dead center. And you're not gonna be as uppity after I
pull this trigger.
They can feel Liberty's fingers wrapping around their throats. To use another analogy, we're
like a giant boa constrictor that's wrapped around them. And they're busy telling us how
powerful they are and all they're gonna do to us, call their bluff. Call their bluff
and mean it.
It's like, I'm not saying playing chicken's good, but that's just what it's all about.
You're not turning off and you're ready to die. You're gonna win the $20,000 prize. And
people bet and play chicken, they're that crazy. Why don't people that are that crazy
get crazy for Liberty and we can beat these people very, very quickly.
Why not just say I'm all in, I'm done, that's it, I'm committed. See, that scares them.
That scares them. The will scares the globalist. And it's now time to have the will and realize
they're gonna take everything we got anyways. We might as well start getting aggressive
with these people.
All right, let's go to your phone calls. Angela in Nebraska, you're on the air about media
propaganda. Go ahead.
Hi, Alex. There's an artist that I love. I'm keeping it really quick. Her name is Santigold
and I don't know if you've seen this video, but it's called The Keepers. And all of the
food at the dinner table is poisoned and they all have cancer wigs on or wigs. And the mother's
pumping the wig and the chicken has breast on it because it's over hormone. And Santi
White, the director and artist Santigold is trying to basically expose the fact that we're
all being poisoned with their hormones and the oil spills and the radioactive food. And
he can't use the word cancer, but I can see through it because my mom died of cancer and
wore the cancer wigs.
Well, what happens is the system intimidates you and says, you can't do this, you can't
do that. They tried to sue milk producers that put no GMO in it, but they counter sued
and won the right to say, our milk doesn't have growth hormone in it. So absolutely,
our girls are going into puberty now at an average age of 10, that used to be 14.
Our boys are going into puberty late. I mean, they're killing us, the cancer rates are off
the chart. It's funny to them and they just wanna go, come on conspiracy theorist, no
one's poisoning you. That's the new thing. Russia Today was saying there's no chemtrails.
I mean, the government admits they're spraying barium salts, aluminum dioxide and other stuff
on record in massive tests everywhere. One got stopped a few months ago out in New Mexico
because the whistle got blown on Bill and Melinda Gates.
We're gonna spray a bunch of stuff on a town. And they're just like, there's no secret testing
on you when everybody knows about the thousands of tests, including lethal ones, we're done.
You don't just sit here and tell us this isn't going on and cuz you're the authority, we
sit here and bend over to it. God bless you, ma'am, I appreciate your call. Let's talk
to Sean in Arizona. Let's talk about the Russians listening on WWCR. Go ahead.
Thank you, Alex. I haven't talked to you in a while. I have a great story from back in
1989 in Jackson Hole. There was a summit there in the third week of September with Russian
Foreign Minister, Sherba Natsi and James Baker, our Secretary of State. The Russian Secret
Service or equivalent came into Jackson Hole Valley three weeks beforehand. At the end
of August, they were there for a month. In that area of Wyoming, hunting season starts
in some areas on the 28th of August. The Russian Secret Service equivalent told the people
up in Teton County and the state people that were working with our federal and their federal
people, the Russians let it be known that they were very unsettled, that they had always
been told that the Americans had a lot of guns.
But what they were seeing, one and two loaded rifles in the rifle racks, in the cabs of
pickups continuously, all day, wherever they were in the valley, some of them were even
afraid. So- Well, yeah, because that very crew of Russians had just killed 67 million
people, raped their wives, beat their brains out, worked people to death in work camps.
They were used to being in total power and everybody's scared of them. And seeing real
human beings armed who weren't scared of them totally freaks them out because they're cowards.
Authoritarians are cowards and the Israeli government's been bad mouthing our guns when
we pay for theirs. The Russians, the Chinese, the British government, all of them can go
straight back to North Korea.
I'm sorry, finish your story. I have one other point here because I've been studying this
thing since the late 70s. You are absolutely right that the kibosh is on for our freedom
in everything. I'd like to make a quick point on what happened with the markets yesterday.
There was a release of a statement by the feds that panicked the whole markets. And
I believe the reason they let it out at this time was because they want, of course, more
money.
Look, I predicted Monday on air, we gotta find the clip, when the market went up 200
points, or was it Tuesday, cuz of the fiscal cliff deal. I said that's a fake sugar high.
The plunge protection team controls it. They're gonna jack it up and then run it right back
down because they're the insiders on record. Congress, they say, is allowed to insider
trade.
Of course, they're not, but they say they are, cuz they're criminals, the ones that
are involved. And they all know, so of course they run it up and run it down and then run
it back up. Go ahead.
And the last thing, I sat and watched C-SPAN last night, watched Joe Biden swear in the
new senators. And it's a shame, a lot of those folks have young families. And they'll just
be turned every which way but loose and never really know what's going on in the country.
It takes effort, I've studied it for 40 years and you've studied it for 30. It takes effort
to research these things, to really understand what is going on.
Why do you think the globalist claim they were fighting with the Russians just a year
ago, two years ago, and now they're all chummy. And the Russians are over here saying, let's
get rid of freedom, let's take the guns. Anybody that criticizes the government's evil, I mean,
why do you think they're doing that?
Well, because now is the time. I mean, we're at this point where we're the most vulnerable.
We've got an administration that is more sympathetic to globalist causes than we ever had. And
the kibosh is on, just like you say every day. You're absolutely right.
Well, I wanna say 17 years on air and two decades of research, I've never been one tenth
as concerned. And I just hope listeners get that. I mean, this is the time where just
cuz we think we're winning the Second Amendment battle right now, that's cuz we got on the
offensive. I guarantee you they're getting ready for false flags, all the signs are there.
And they're going to blame it on us. And we've got to instantly come out and not take the
guilt they put on us. Minute one, when they blame us, we gotta go, well, hey, you did
it then.
And they go, how dare you? Well, you're saying we did it. No, we don't believe a thing you
say, you did it. And they'll go, well, that's outrageous. Well, you just said we did it.
You did it, you did it, you did it. You have the history of staging stuff, you did it.
You're the suspect. You're the suspect. You're the suspect government. You're the foreign
bank run collaborators. Get out of our country. Get out, get out, get out.

presents the Alex Jones Show because there's a war on for your mind. And I've been ranting
about foreign governments and media teaming up against the American people. This is a
big deal.
And the globalists just think that because we're Americans, we have such hospitality.
That's what it is. You go ahead Russians and Chinese communists and corrupt Mexican government,
you know, we'll turn our guns and we're sorry we killed those kids. Yeah, publish our names
in the newspaper like we're criminals. Yeah, you know what, we'll prove we're good. That's
the mind game.
But we take the fact that foreign governments are in our face. If we take that fact and
point it out, we can use their outrageous attempt to take over, to totally turn this
debate around. And it's starting to happen. If you go to Infowars.com, Obama teams up
with foreign media and governments to destroy Second Amendment, Paul Watson and Alex Jones.
Russian, British, Australian talking heads. Yeah, and the Israelis didn't back us up on
the Second Amendment, their foreign ministry at least. We need to demand a full statement
on that to correct that. And of course, it's in there, Al Jazeera is coming out against
the Second Amendment.
I mean, it's ridiculous. And of course, they don't speak for the Australians. They don't
speak for the Israelis. They don't speak for the Russians. We're not against the Chinese
or Russian people. It's their corrupt governments. Get your stinking hands off my guns. Okay,
you understand that? You understand that? Just like I told our corrupt government when
they tried to start a war with Russia, don't do it.
That is what this is all about, ladies and gentlemen. Gerald Cilente is coming up. I'm
gonna go to some more of your calls as well. We've got a listener with solutions on KKGM
1630 up in Dallas. Great affiliate up there, covers Dallas, Fort Worth. Everybody needs
to spread the word to friends and family about all of our affiliates you're listening on.
Also, don't forget, we are listener supported. We need your prayers more than anything. I
mean, you can see it, you can feel it. We're at the tip of the spear. We need your prayers.
And we need your financial support buying books, videos, t-shirts, the magazine, which
is at cost, but it gets the word out. All of it, Infowarshop.com, high quality propure

Just all of the information, strategic relocation, breaking down the global threat, that new
film we produced, all of it at Infowarshop.com, or 888-253-3139. Let's go to Ryan in Texas.
Again, a 1630 AM listener who has some quick solutions. Go ahead.
Actually, I don't have solutions. I wanted to talk to you about them. I've been the listener
for a while. You have a ton of knowledge. And I know that your main message is really
to spread the word. So taking that knowledge, I started my own teacher company, so obviously
just to spread the word. Like you said a few minutes ago, to quote you, I'm in, I'm committed.
I wanted to talk about real solutions because I listen to you all the time and I hear and
I gain knowledge all the time, but- Okay, well so much of this is a moral issue.
They're moral, we're murderers of children. After saying to you, well, we have to go,
wait a minute, you're the ones that took the guns out of the school. See, so much of it
is about selling tyranny. So we said, call the State House in Illinois, stop the gun
ban.
We put articles out, others did. We flooded them and they knew the villagers were coming
with pitchforks, so they backed off. Same thing, we introduced bills to arm the teachers
in the school. So this stops, then it actually fixes things. So you're saying, what are the
solutions?
Call us the private Federal Reserve, bring the power of the Treasury, of the purse back
into the Treasury. Get constitutionalists elected. I mean, there's so many, run for
office yourself locally, educate people. So much of it is just getting the word out, sir.
See, they wanna keep this gun grab under the radar. We're not gonna let that happen. You
see what I'm saying?
Yes, sir, I just feel helpless. I feel like we never win and we're always on the defense.
So what you're saying about going on the offense, you know, writing letters, suing them and
all that, these all sound great. I just don't know how to do them. I've written letters
to my Congress.
All right, well listen, you can sue any city you're in that's putting so-called sodium
fluoride in the water. Stay there, I'll come back to you, then I'll go to others.

We have a caller asking for solutions and saying he doesn't know how to take action.
All over the world and in the U.S. there have been successful lawsuits pointing out that
not only sodium fluoride is out of the water but a bunch of other chemicals. So you do
a four year request, you get where they're getting the fluoride, you document, you get
in, you take photos of it at the water plant with a skull and crossbones for the exhibit.
You have to go file this to do this. You put them on notice you're gonna sue them because
they're hitting you with a dangerous chemical weapon and making you pay for it. And then
you just copy the lawsuits that have been successful in other states and counties and
you file a suit on the city.
And you go in city council and you talk about it during the citizens communication to draw
attention to it and then local media will report on it. And usually there's already
an activist group locally that's sick of it. You get aggressive. They're assaulting you
with a chemical weapon. You assault them with a court. Courts are meant to take a caveman
system of violence when somebody's violent to you, you can only be violent back and to
go and do it through a court.
But we've abandoned the courts. So there's a solution. Take our video we put up yesterday,
demand a real plan. It's had 64,000 views. It'll probably get about 300, 400,000 views
at the rate it's going. In the next few days, it needs to get 10 million views. But the
point is we just churn videos out, pointing out that government's the number one threat.
Government's the danger. Don't turn your guns in. Then politically people have the will
to not turn their guns in.
And then we say, look, I came on air and I said, I'm not turning them in, come and get
them. And it's one thing to say that to your buddy at the bar. I said it on the radio to
3 million people, okay? That's where the real power is saying, you know what? You gotta
go through my body.
I'm done playing games, okay? You're criminals. You're unconstitutional. You've committed
all these crimes. Cease and desist now. And it gives moral support to the good police
and military. Most of them are good men and women who know this is wrong and they need
our moral support. We need theirs. And everybody else, you've got to stand.
So I hope that answers your question, Ryan. God bless you. Let's talk to Ken in Pennsylvania.
You're on the air. Go ahead.
I'm here, Alex.
Hey, buddy.
I ran out of my longevity products a couple weeks ago running around from the holidays
and all that. Didn't reorder in time. And because of my job, I'm up and down the ladders
all day. I was getting soreness in my legs and my ankles. Anyway, my new packages came
in like a few days ago and it's gone. I'm back to fighting weight, fighting the-
The products at Infowarshealth.com, this isn't a planned call. The guy's just calling in
about this. The products we've assembled and put together at Infowarshealth.com are the
best out there from our research. And the dramatic effects for Aaron Dykes, myself and

Ease the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
For the balance of the hour today we are joined by Gerald Cilente. We'll also continue with
some of the phone callers that are already on hold because Gerald can speak about any
issue. He's a very well researched best selling author. Worked as a consultant. Worked in
a political circles as well. I really need no introduction here. Trendsresearch.com.
Gerald is an American Trends forecaster, publisher of Trends Journal, business consultant
and author who makes predictions about global financial markets and other events of historical
importance. Cilente has described himself as a political atheist and a citizen of the
world. He's appeared basically on everything under the sun and he is a regular guest with
us. Something we really appreciate and his quarterly Trends Journal and his daily and
weekly trends updates are invaluable. Everyone should also support real media and real analysis
and go and become subscribers and then hand off the great color magazine to folks that
you know.
It's got the great art of Anthony Frida in it. He's also got Dr. Paul Craig Roberts riding
with him. Roberts has pointed out recently that so is USA Today of all people, of all
outfits that the Israeli government didn't defend our second amendment and said, we don't
have armed teachers. No, you shouldn't have guns. When we pay to arm the teachers in Israel,
that's on record they do.
The Russian media has come out and said we should not have our guns and they attack me.
We've had the Chinese government come out through their media and say we shouldn't have
guns and quote, there should be a war against gun owners, Piers Morgan. All this media,
BBC, Australian news, it's despicable that all these authoritarian systems want our guns.
And I wanted to talk to Gerald about this first because I wanna get his take and his
view on it.
Then we'll get into his latest forecasting and fine tuning cuz so much of what he said
is coming true like clockwork. What he sees unfolding now in 2013 to 2014 as the economy
continues to deteriorate. They've announced in states all over the country federally funded
local police checkpoints looking for criminals and gangs.
And they search for guns while they're at it, legal guns. They drag you out of your
car and take photos of your tattoos. That's mainstream news in Texas. We're going into
a deeper level of incremental martial law. And is that happening because the hammer is
about to drop financially?
It's all accelerating basically and Gerald Salente joins us to be able to speak about
this. Gerald, a lot's happened since you were on three or four weeks ago, my friend. Good
to have you on.
Thanks for having me and happy new year to you and everyone.
You too. What is your take on the shooting there in Connecticut very close to you and
how they're publishing names of gun owners so we can be robbed and so we can be demonized.
How they're saying all gun owners are racist Klan members. These are quotes. It looks like
they really are coming after us.
Yeah, they are. And it's what you said before. Matter of fact, we're finishing up the winter
edition of the Trends Journal and we go into all the laws and restrictions that they're
putting out there to control us. And it is because to use your phrase, the hammer is
falling. And on the gun control issue, let's play this back. When did we first start seeing
these kind of uncontrollable lunatics losing their minds in mass killings of people?
I mentioned that when I was a young man, I remember this this movie, a young kid, actually,
in cold blood by Truman Capote. And this guy killed like, you know, four people or something
in a farm village in Iowa or someplace. And he was whacked out on aspirin. When you look
and see when this mass murder trend began, it began with the issuance. It's all there.
You could look at the data. It began with the issuance of these psychotropic drugs.
And as you follow what went on in Newtown, there's very little talk, if anything, about
what this kid was whacked out on. And they're saying that he was suffering from Asperger's
disease or syndrome. And consequently, it is assumed that he was on psychotropic drugs.
And they're keeping that sealed because in every case it keeps coming out. The shooters
were on all sorts of these drugs that in the insert says causes you to kill people and
kill yourself. Just like our militaries at record suicides, they give them suicide pills.
I mean, what do you expect is gonna happen?
Not only that, when you look at the latest data coming out on how much money the military
is spending on these drugs and prescription drugs, it's absurd. It's obscene. And again,
you don't even have to read the label of Zoloft or Ritalin or Prozac. Just tune in to any
TV station and listen to the ads from the prescription drugs that they're selling.
And after they show the person romping through the fields and bluebirds flying everywhere
and how great life is, and they go through what the side effects of these drugs are,
you'll hear suicide come up more frequently than not. So it's not an issue of gun control.
It's an issue of drug control. And it's not an issue of marijuana. It's an issue of the
pharmaceutical industry that are killing the brains of the nation. And then when we look
at the other issue, and I hear all these politicians come out, the Dianne Feinstein's, the not-so-Feinstein's,
the Obama's, all of them, one after another, saying what we have to do to stop this cycle
of violence.
I got an idea. Why don't we start at the top? You want to talk about murder? Hey, you blow
some people off in a school. How about wiping out entire villages? I got one for you. You
want to talk about a cycle of violence? How about that wonderful war that you senators
and you congressmen voted to send our people to to go kill other people by the millions?
You want to talk about a cycle of violence? Hey, let's wait for Tuesday. Yeah, terror
Tuesday. You know that day when Obama signs off on what drones to send over to foreign
countries and kill people? Oh, and the wives and the kids around them, just call them collateral
damage. It's a culture of cruelty. Why shouldn't people do this? They'll see it coming from
the top and the fish rots from the head down.
And I want to mention about what happened over here with this newspaper in Rockland
County, not far from us. This is beautiful. This is great. You want to talk about imbeciles
and cowards, the editor of this, the publisher of that newspaper, a coward, a little slimy
piece of crap, publishing people's names that have guns. And why am I calling her a slimy
little piece of crap? Because right here in the Turlet Paper of Record, newspaper that
put gun permit map online hires armed guards.
Check that out for hypocrisy. No, you can't arm yourself, you little weenie, disgusting
individual. You need somebody to protect you. You need an armed guard. I got an armed guard
for you. Check this line out. The safety of my staff is my top priority, Ms. Hansen said
in a telephone interview. Guess what? The safety of my staff is their own priority.
If you can't stand up for your life, you don't deserve to have it if you're gonna call somebody
out and start a fight. And that's what these people do. They start a fight and then they
call armed guards in because they don't have the courage, the dignity, the respect to defend
themselves.
Gerald, I've studied a lot of history, so have you, because to know what's gonna happen
currently in the future, you have to know history. The hypocrisy of the so-called liberals,
these are not liberals. It's not that the conservatives are good either, the mainline
ones.
They're authoritarians too, but this group of Obamanoids, they've all got bodyguards.
They've all got concealed carries, Dianne Feinstein admits it. But then she says, Mr.
and Mrs. America, this is a quote, I'm gonna make you turn all your guns in. I'm sure you've
seen that video. It's crazy. It's like they're gonna have guns, but then say we're trash
and publish where we live, cuz they're doing this all over the country with government
list of concealed carry people.
And this has been done before and people get robbed. And I hope they get sued for doing
this because this is harassment. This is a terroristic action. I mean, they are the scum
of the earth. They've got armed guards, Gerald, but they'll publish that you've got guns.
Yeah, I know, I mean, who's making this crap up, an armed guard? Why can't you arm yourself?
You gotta hire somebody? Yeah, what kind of, who made this crap up? And then they brag
about it. We hired armed guards? Doesn't anybody see the disconnect here?
They are pathetic, disgusting jellyfish. And again, up top, they want our guns to enslave
us. But the general liberal is really a chicken neck who's never been in a, I walk on the
hike and bike trail and I could tell who real liberals are, who love liberty, they're outgoing.
But the fake liberals are literally scared chicken necks of everything. They are scared
of their own shadows. And so they want us to live like disarmed slaves like they do.
All right, now let's put this all into perspective to make it real at another level. Let's suppose
they pass gun control. How effective is it going to be with some 300 million guns out
there? Who's going to have the guns? I'll tell you how effective it's going to be. It's
going to be as effective as prohibition was. I'll tell you how effective it's going to
be. It's going to be as effective as the war on drugs. Who can, what are they going to
do? They're not going to be able to control this.
I'll tell you how effective it is in countries like Brazil and other places where it's almost
impossible to get guns. You know who has the guns? The criminals. And they're running loose.
That's who's going to have the guns. Stay there, sir. You're right. Let's talk
about that. That hasn't been looked at. The crime rate will explode, which is what the
big city mafia wants. It's absolutely heartbreaking. All over America,

It's the only one you've got. On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping
to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years. Unfortunately, with
taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing and medical, many retirees are forced
to live below the poverty line. Is this a flaw of free enterprise or is our monetary
unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation
and higher taxes? These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's
book, The Creature from Jekyll Island. Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American
needs to know about central bank power, a gripping adventure into the secret world of
international banking cartel. Hi, this is Ted Anderson. I will give a silver dollar

Hey there, Frank Bates here. Have you heard about the weird device that could wipe out
280 million Americans? This is really scary stuff. Defense experts warn that this odd
device poses the greatest threat we've ever known. In fact, just a few weeks ago, former
Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich wrote an op-ed piece for the Washington Post warning
about this deadly threat. I can't believe that more people aren't talking about this.
It may be because the liberals and the government are trying to cover it up. That's why my friend
just created a free video at weirddevice.com that exposes this threat and blows the doors
off the conspiracy. Go watch the shocking video at weirddevice.com right now to discover
exactly what it is, plus discover the number one way you and your family can survive this
deadly attack. I'm not sure how long this video will be online, so go to weirddevice.com
before it's gone forever. Again, that's weirddevice.com.
Gerald Salente is our guest. Gerald, I want to get back to the point you were making about
crime rates exploding in Chicago, New York, everywhere they take the people's arms. I
mean, it's common sense. This idea of let's don't arm the pilots, they can be trusted
to fly the plane, but let's literally get a $20 an hour security guard who's had a couple
of firearms classes that anybody could take, and let's have them come guard us.
Or let's put federal air marshals on all the planes to spy on everybody instead of, I mean,
it's this idea that only government specialists can do it. It's all about a government monopoly,
but doesn't the power structure, I want to get back into the point you were making, but
then I want to ask you this central question. We can see where this is going, you've talked
about it, you've wrote about it, history, we've seen it.
Yeah, they may get half the public to want to turn the guns in, and half the public to
suck their thumbs, and think government really cares about them, and maybe the government
can come and wipe their hind ends. But a lot of us, 10, 15, 20, 30% know what's going on,
we're not gonna go along, we're done.
So they can't put us all in prison, I mean, the system obviously knows it's gonna cause
a civil war if Obama signs an executive order to try to confiscate guns, Gerald Cilente.
Well, yeah, they're going to try something, I don't believe they're gonna go that far
with it, because I think they know that they're not gonna get away with it. And we even saw
in Chicago, what was it, in Illinois, they tried passing some legislation I saw on your
website on the Prison Planet website.
Yes, we shot it down.
You're following that?
Yes.
And they didn't pass it. I think what they're going to do is they'll come up with some other
kind of restriction, and it'll only go so far. They'll keep playing out this political
capital for as much as they can get from it. But in the end, I don't think they're going
to succeed. There will be more restrictions guaranteed.
And again, the stupidity, for example, there was just a guy in Switzerland that killed
three people or four people the other day. Everybody in Switzerland is allowed to have
a gun, they all have guns. They're not killing each other. This has nothing to do with having
the gun. It has to do with a society that's out of control, a society that's over medicated.
And again, let's stay on that issue for just a moment. Now, you've been following this
closer than anybody that I know. And you're looking at every piece of information coming
out. What drugs was this kid on? Why do we have to hear from some police superintendent
or inspector whoever say, we have the information, but we're keeping it private because we don't
want you to know anything.
I mean, who can make this? What's wrong? Why don't we know? Why aren't the books open?
Why can't we say what drug tipped this kid out of his mind? Hey, all of those wankers
out there that have been screaming about marijuana over all the years and how it could become
a gateway drug and lead to worse things.
Why aren't you screaming out against all of these psychotropic drugs that they're pumping
into all of these kids? And now it's getting even worse. Here's what's going on. A kid
grows up in a family of which there are tens of millions in this country. His mother's
whacked out on meth. He doesn't know who his father is. He's living in this drama, this
situation that's hell every day. He goes to school, oh, he becomes unruly.
So what do they do? Well, there are no social programs anymore. When I was a kid, there
was CYOs, there were PALS, police athletic leagues, there were YMCAs. The kids had a
place to go. If things are uneasy, you had a little support, the churches, whatever.
Now you're on your own. You know what they're doing to these kids? They're feeding them
drugs to calm them down. That's right. Millions and millions of kids getting drugged up by
big pharma, their minds are being blown.
So for this, they say we need gun control. And as I said, if we're going to have gun
control, start with Obama, start with Bush, start with Clinton. Bombs away over everybody,
kill millions. But take the guns away from people because they could become dangerous.
But wait a minute, Gerald. Obama fake cried and couldn't squeeze tears out and now has
released another fake photo of him sad over the dead children. Just like the fake Situation
Room photo, they had to admit, I mean, the milking of this, he isn't crying over the
hundreds of dead Mexican kids from Fast and Furious, is he?
Now how about the million people the United States killed in Iraq? How about the ongoing
slaughter in Afghanistan? Just yesterday, another predator drone killed the military.
There's eight other people that happened to be around them.
I bet Obama cried over that. He signed the death order. We'll be right back with Gerald
Cilenti.

We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
You're listening to the Alex Jones Show. Here's some of the top stories at Infowars.com. Police
kicked out of Bellaville Denny's. Am I pronouncing that right? For being armed. CBS News. I saw
that this morning. It just blew me away. And the newscast acts like it's kind of reasonable.
So the anti-gunners, the rank and file are so scared of guns that now they're even scared
with police with guns. Actually, we have that clip of the DEA guy shooting himself. Maybe
we should play that brief clip for Gerald here if we can find it.
But the issue here is if you're gonna trust police with guns, you gotta trust firefighters
with guns. I think they should have them as backup when they get shot at sometimes during
riots. You should trust the citizens with guns. You should have the pilots with guns.
The answer is armed good people, okay? And that's been known throughout history. And
the areas that have the highest crime are the areas where they've taken the guns. But
here it is, police kicked out of Denny's for being armed. The police chief, Bill Clay,
and by the way, we have a police chief coming on the Sunday show who's calling for a Second
Amendment zone.
He says he's gonna nullify all the federal laws. People say, well, you can't do that.
Really? You've got 800 plus cities that nullify the illegal alien laws that are actually constitutional.
How about we nullify laws that are unconstitutional? The new orders come after a New Year's Day
clash between five detectives and one Denny's manager.
The department says the detectives were out of uniform but were wearing their badges when
manager David Rice asked them to either leave or put their guns in the vehicle. And of course,
they argued with them but left. Rice told detectives that one of their weapons, specifically
a female detective's gun, was making another diner feel uncomfortable.
As the officers were leaving without their food, General Manager Michael Van walked up
and corrected the manager and said it was fine for them to stay. But officers said it
would be too awkward. And I found a file, this must be another article. I had another
one here in my stack where the police chief called it crazy politics.
And I wanted his full quote. The point is, ladies and gentlemen, I had a carpet cleaner
guy. I've told this story 100 times. I'm not gonna keep Gerald on holding longer, but I
don't want his take on this. I had the carpet cleaner there and my girlfriend lived with
me.
We got married. It's my wife, very, very evil, but we were about to get married. She just
moved in. And we're getting a house, a little house, carpet cleaned, and my studio, and
I didn't have any kids yet. There was a shotgun up in a 243 and some stuff. And the guy said,
I can't clean in there.
Well, and the assistant was from Texas. He goes, no, man, guns are legal here. The guy
goes, no, no, and he leaves. And I had to call him and go, well, we've stopped him calling
the police, but yes, he's not comfortable. We'll send another crew. And I'm like, you
know what, just forget it.
But this is the attitude where these people think guns come out at night and kill people.
And here's another headline, Boston mayor, vice president, guaranteed gun control before
Sandy Hook shooting. Leading gun control advocate, we'll get it done by the end of January. I
told you, they plan with even an executive order.
The head of Gunners of America says they may actually try it. Gerald Cilente, what is your
take on the citizens so scared now that they call the police when they see a gun in your
gun rack or they see a gun in your gun case? Or police now are having people freak out
when they've got guns.
Well it's fear and hysteria. Look what happened down in Maryland the other day. The little
kid six years old went pow, pow, pow, and they threw him out of school. I said, good
thing the kid didn't go bang, bang, bang. They would have the SWAT teams in there shooting
him.
Now the country's lost its mind. I mean, look at every level it's breaking down. This whole
thing of it's fear and hysteria. Look what they did with the fiscal cliff. Pick the cat
category. How they had the people freaked out since election day. I mean, it's still
going on. So you have a society that's lost its dignity, its respect, its courage, its
passion, and they're living unfulfilled lives.
So when you live these unfulfilled lives and have nothing going for you, you start making
life miserable for other people around you. And again, this gun issue to me is more of
a prescription drug issue and people refuse to hold onto it and they keep avoiding the
fact. And the fact is that all of these drugs make a lot of people that are already over
the edge, pushing them even further. And it's well documented and well known.
Gerald, I wanna get into the economy and some issues and then take some wildcard phone calls
questions for you here. But look, in the 1980 study of Prozac, they admitted a 14 or was
it 15 time increase in suicide, that's mainstream news. A decade ago, we finally forced all
serotonin reuptake inhibitors or SSRIs or SRIs to put in there that it causes mania,
schizophrenia, mass murder, violence, suicide, I mean, it's all in these drugs insert.
And in almost every shooting, they try to suppress it, but it always comes out later
they were on it. Like this time that it was under psychiatric care, give me a break, he's
on it. It says when you have Asperger's, they try to put you on. Prozac is actually the
one they recommend, one of the oldest.
So we know these pills do it. And then we always wonder, it's always a goth, devil worshipper
obsessed with shoot them up video games, who is literally taking hallucinogenic drugs who
does this. It's open and shut, it's the drugs. Why do I have to lose my guns because mommy
likes to jack her kid up on a bunch of drugs instead of giving them a spanking or making
them carry out the trash?
I mean, why can't we have discipline for these kids?
Again, you nailed it. That's what I'm saying. So the discussion starts to lose its focus
because it keeps going into all these different areas. Again, for me, the two areas are very
simple. One is drugs and the other is a culture of cruelty. We have presidents that get out
there and brag how they kill people. Hey, Obama got Osama. Hey, wasn't that great?
Hillary bragged about Gaddafi. She goes, I came, I saw, he died.
Yeah, so it's a culture of violence and it's a culture of prescription drug addicted society.
Where do you predict it's going to go? And then let's shift into your latest trends and
what's really front and center in the new Trends Journal. Everybody's got to go to the
site with all the videos and the material, trendsresearch.com. I stop there daily, trendsresearch.com.
People can go there and subscribe and support what Gerald's doing, but really get the magazine,
the journals, you can then give it to others.
This is the type of thing you want to leave at the dental office. This is the type of
thing you want to pay forward. Again, Trends Journal, ladies and gentlemen, available at
trendsresearch.com or trendsjournal.com. What else do you see on the radar? What else is
front and center?
Our front and center war, and they're leading us to it. Remember, you've heard me say this
before, we're watching a parallel universe happen. The crash of 1929, the Great Depression,
currency wars, trade wars, world war, the panic of 08, the Great Depression. There's
a depression going on in a lot of countries worldwide, including here. If you're out of
work and you're starving and things are terrible, it's a depression and there are a lot of people
in it. Currency wars. Last year we heard Guido Montega and this year from Brazil saying there's
a currency war. We just heard Mervyn King, the outgoing head of the Bank of England in
New York. There's a currency war going on. Now we have a new prime minister of Japan,
Abe. There's a currency war. What's the first thing he did when he got elected? He told
the Bank of Japan, do what they're doing in the United States. Do what they're doing in
Europe. Do what they're doing in China. Do what they're doing all over the world. Print
more money. Devalue the currency because there's a war on and the war is for exports. If your
currency is too strong, your manufacturers can't push product out of the country. So
Japan do like they've done in the USA. Devalue the currency so that their exporters could
export more. Stage next trade wars. They're heating up and world war and anybody out there
that doesn't believe that the United States currency has been devalued. Well, take a look
at gold prices from where they are now and where they were 10 years ago. So what is going
on for the our forecast is economics more of the same, but worse. They're going to continue
to print money. That's the only way that they're keeping this going. And by doing so, keeping
interest rates at or near zero, which they are coming out of the Fed. So the banks are
getting all the dough that they can. And then you put the other piece on top, low interest
rates. Okay. The housing market's in its worst decline since the Great Depression. What's
holding it up? Oh, you can get, you know, you can get a loan now for what on residential
2.77%. So now we can see how they key. Oh, and by the way, on that new fiscal cliff deal,
they extended the mortgage tax deductions. So that is a $600 billion cost that helps
the mortgage investment. That's right. They didn't do that to help mom and pop. They did
that to help the banksters again who loan this out of nothing. And what's amazing is
Obama saying no new payroll taxes. He swore it, but 77% of American workers got that tax
increase and he raised a bunch of other taxes. That's exactly right. So this keeping this
mortgage deduction in there, that helps the mortgage business. That's all that was for.
So and it's guaranteed. I mean, who makes this thing up? I'll be a bank. I'll loan you
money to buy a house. You default on the loan. Okay, don't worry about the FHA, Freddie Mac
and Fannie Mae. We'll cover the bet that the bank made that made a bad bet and they get
to take your house and then resell it. Anyway, moving back to the war because it's all connected.
When all else fails, they take you to war and they're going to take us to war, I believe,
with Syria and that is the gateway to go into Iran. So when I talk about the first great
war, do the math. There's a war in Libya. There's a war in Syria. There's a war that's
heating up again, a revolution in Egypt. The Muslim Brotherhood took over, which by the
way, had nothing, nothing to do with the so-called Arab Spring. They were not on the streets.
Same thing in Tunisia. After they overthrew that government, whoop, here's the Muslim
Brotherhood. Oh, and by the way, take over, take a trip over to Yemen. Not far away. A
civil war going on there. Corrupt government that we, the American taxpayer, are supporting
and President Obama sending in predator drones. Check out Bahrain, not too far. A civil war
going on, but don't say anything bad about Bahrain because the United States has the
fifth fleet there.
Hey, it came out that Bahrain actually pays money and others to CNN for fake reports.
The whistle got blew by Amber Lyon, who's won three Emmys for her news reporting, and
it never even became a news issue. That CNN isn't just connected to the Pentagon, and
PsyOps just came out 12 years ago. They're actually foreign funded.
Of course they are. Look what's going on what just happened with Al Gore, just selling his
current TV. Who did he sell it to? Al Jazeera. Who owns Al Jazeera? Hey, it couldn't be to
cut a government, could it?
Well, and again, what do you make of all these foreign TV stations domestically saying America
needs to turn its guns in? Why are they all ganging up on us?
Well, because they're controlling the people and they don't want it. They don't want the
people to have any freedom.
So all these slimy governments are in it together, basically.
Well, again, going back to Qatar, these are the people that started, and by the way, there's
a link that subscribers get. I was on China Today with the Al Jazeera Washington bureau
chief prior to the Libyan war. You got to check this out. We'll put the link up there
for everybody. We'll put it on YouTube on the Gerald Cilenti or Trends Journal channels.
And this is prior to the war. You want to see this easy talking guy lose it at the end.
It's a comic book. What happened was that the Arab Little League, all of these kings,
emirs, dictators by any other name, are the ones that are destabilizing the area and sending
all of the arms in that are supporting these Islamist Al Qaeda wackos that the United States,
of course, began supporting under Jimmy Carter called the Mujahideen that's overthrowing
these governments.
So now going back to Al Gore, he just scored a hundred million bucks because his worthless
current TV didn't have anybody watching it when they had as low as 40,000 people tuning
in.
By the way, that's a political payoff, having foreign governments later pay you for something
that's not really worth it. That's the oldest trick in the book. I mean, this is just, look
at Congress saying they're allowed to insider trade and then passing a law that actually
lets them insider trade, claiming the law outlaws them insider trading.
I mean, it is just unbelievable how much trouble we're in.
But it's perfect for a piece of crap like Al Gore. He just sold us out and brought Al
Jazeera in to do propaganda for us. This is the same slimeball that sold out America and
sent out all our jobs overseas with NAFTA.
And he's got the young turds on there that show young Turks calling to take our guns.
It's all just a bunch of foreign traders. I mean, how much will we put up with?
He traded the country out on that debate with Ross Perot back in the early 90s. And people
don't understand that Ronald Reagan couldn't push NAFTA through because the Democrats were
against it. They knew that labor would lose all its jobs. George Bush Sr. couldn't push
NAFTA through because the Democrats knew that it would suck out all our jobs.
But as long as Al Gore and Clinton did it, it's cute. Democrats love getting destroyed
as long as they feel like they're winning and their party's in. They love it.
As long as one of them destroys them, Clinton pulled off what the other ones couldn't. So
Al Gore is the perfect metaphor for selling out the country, whether it's selling out
our freedom to hear great programming and not be propagandized by the Qatar government
that's starting wars throughout the Middle East.
And that's their perfect cut out. And of course, they're connected to British intelligence.
I mean, I think it's time to really look at these foreign-run TV stations domestically
because they're running around trying to overthrow our republic. I mean, what do you call that
when foreign governments come in? Cuz Al Jazeera says turn our guns in. I say Al Jazeera needs
to get out of our country.
And that's what I'm saying, that Al Gore is the same guy that sold out the country, that
took our jobs overseas, and now he's grabbing some more dough. So going back to the wars-
I'll tell you what, we gotta go to break. We'll come right back and I promise go to
some calls here. General Salente is our guest. It's just unbelievable. I hadn't even gotten
to the Al Gore Man Bear Pignage. What a piece of trash.
We have witnessed two terrible storms in the East, but we are still in the eye of the perfect
storm. The most devastating economic conditions since the Great Depression, America's worst
drought in agricultural history, and now the economic results of the presidential election.
This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply. I just doubled down and got even
more supplies from E Foods Direct, and I recommend you do the same. It's time to get your own
supply from E Foods Direct. I know I won't be standing in a bread line trading my freedom
for food. I'm taking control of my future, and you're nuts if you don't do the same.

Hi, my name is Annette, and due to menopause symptoms for nearly two years, I suffered
loss of beer hot flashes, which prevented me from sleeping all night. It was so hard
to work because I continued all day to have the hot flashes from hell. I was exhausted
and depleted. After only three weeks on one world weight, I have no hot flashes, and I'm
sleeping normally again. I feel energized and strong. This is an amazing product.
It is a little known fact that every single cell of your body is supposed to produce 10%
of its protein content as glutathione. But due to toxicity and aging, it does not. Could
your glutathione be a missing factor in optimal cell function for your entire body? If you
restore the optimal glutathione levels in your cells, especially your glands and organs,
then as a result, your glands and organs work better. Imagine the quality of life improvement
you might have. To order One World Whey, call 888-988-3325. That's 888-988-3325. Or visit

All right, we're going to jam in a few phone calls in this next segment and the next, and
I'm going into overdrive in the next hour to play some special reports and take more
calls. Gerald Cilente is our guest. I'm Alex Jones, if you just tuned in. I said I would
announce two big contests today, but I'm going to shoot a video that'll air on the nightly
news tonight where I break down the new contest we're going to have.
We're going to have a $5,000 contest. We got two $1,000 contests I'm about to pay out on
next week. We've had like over 20 contests now over the years. We're going to have one
that's $5,000 that I'll be announcing and another that's $100,000. And the reason I'm
doing this is to get the word out and it will reach tens upon tens of millions of people
with the message of liberty.
Wait till you hear about these contests. It's going to be big. But I've got to codify my
thoughts. I haven't written up the rules yet, so I'll announce it tonight in a special video
the next week officially. Kick it off because we've got to turn loose the power of the people.
Continuing here, this is everything we're talking about. Globalism is foreign financial
interests that are authoritarian coming in and buying off your government and then having
the government give the tax money and no bid contracts to them. And then they want to secure
that.
So now they want our guns too and our freedom. It's just mafia. It's organized crime. That's
what the new world order is. And that's what we've become. And now we are such a joke that
all these foreign governments are here propagandizing us and paying for CNN and paying for what's
on current TV and lecturing us on all these channels that we need to give our guns up.
And it's enough, okay? It's enough. Gerald, have they miscalculated here? Or will America
just put up with anything?
Well, what I'd like to do is come back at another time shortly and go over our top trends
for 2013. And one of them is the Great Awakening. There was before this revolution in this country,
there was an awakening. And part of the Great Awakening was that people woke up to the idea
that they should not bow to nobility, that they weren't better than the rest of the commoners.
It became also something where people realized that their salvation was dependent upon their
actions on how they behaved, what they did, and how they would bring themselves up to
the highest level to be the best human beings they could be. A lot of, by the way, Thomas
Paine's work is written in the context of the Great Awakening. And there was a religious
element to it as well. But forgetting the religious element, I believe we're going to
answer your question. We're going to have another Great Awakening. The nobility had
become this red carpet crowd. They never show up without a red carpet. Do you know how sick
and tired I am of watching Hillary Clinton or somebody, the president, waving from their
jumbo jets?
Who are they waving to? A bunch of prostitutes down below? A bunch of flaky, flunky aides?
But yet you see these pictures.
No, they're behaving like royalty. They're saying, I'm God, you're nothing. And by the
way, I'm gonna take your guns. And by the way, I'm gonna take 85 million a month and
put it in my pocket. And if you don't like it, a SWAT team's gonna drop by.
Exactly, so now the people are going to start rebelling against the royalty. All of the
charade is down. How could any self-respecting human being listen to a McConnell or a Reid
or a Pelosi or a Bonner or an Obama or a Laurel and Hardy? That's all it is and everyone knows
it. The charade is coming very clear to many.
And then when you go overseas, it's no different. The Great Awakening is beginning to happen.
You have a guy like this Roy over there in Spain or Merkel or three card Monty who just
stepped down in Italy. And one after another, when do these people, Hollande or Cameron-
Hold on Gerald, stay there, we're gonna take a couple of calls.
Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNlive.com today.
Yeah.
That's kind of a weekend.

Coast to coast, direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want to stop tyranny? Well,
so does he. Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
All right, let's jam in a few quick calls for Gerald Cilente. I want to invite him back
because I want to get his trends for the new year next week if he wants. So the week after
that, whenever Gerald wants, he's on. I always love listening to him, so do our listeners.
Great information, really points out the hypocrisy and accurately predicts what's going to come
in the future. And I agree with him. People finding their dignity. Everything the globalists
do is about dominating us, breaking our will like a pimp does to a woman he's drug off
into slavery. And we have got to stop letting government dominate us. It's doing it everywhere
because it knows what it's doing.
Let's go to George in Connecticut. No, no, no. George is at first. John in Wyoming on
Feinstein listening on WWCR. Go ahead, John.
Thank you, Alex, and thank you for having your great guest Gerald Cilente on today.
You bet.
I had something happen yesterday that both of you will enjoy. I called Dianne Feinstein's
office in Washington, D.C., and one of her young male staffers answered the phone. I
said, as per the gun control measure Ms. Feinstein is introducing today, I said, please give
her my congratulations. I had no idea she was a supporter of the Fuhrer. I said, Adolf
Hitler did the same thing to his people in 1934, and then we saw what he did to his people
after he disarmed them. So I just wanted to give her a very hearty congratulations for
following her guide, the Fuhrer. And I said, by the way, if you think that anyone is going
to be obeying your gun control edicts, ask her how many murderers, rapists, armed robbers,
drug dealers or gang bangers are going to turn in their firearms. I said the answer
is like her credibility. Zero. I said, we saw how well the alcohol prohibition worked.
We saw how well the drug prohibition has worked. And now you expect different results with
the gun prohibition. I said criminals don't obey the law.
And what did the creature on the other end of the line say?
He started hollering, what zip code are you calling in from? I said, never mind that.
I said, I'm not a constituent. But since she introduced this legislation, I thought I would
call up- Yeah, they'll also imply that if you're not
in their state, she's trying to take our rights nationwide. Shut up, Feinstein, you represent
everybody. That's the stuff they pull as well. You need to call her and let her know. Thanks
for waking everybody up, you pig witch. I'm sorry, go ahead, Gerald.
Bravo, that was perfect. What he said was perfect. Not a word minced and not a word
wasted. And by the way, on the Feinstein issue, I was just talking about Al Gore before and
the deal that they made to get their station on all their worthless current TV on all these
cable companies that would never normally carry it, but because of his connections.
Do you know what are the investors in there? Dianne Feinstein's husband.
Isn't that a coincidence? Who gets banker bailout money and all the insider trading
stuff that mommy's involved in. But she got the Senate Ethics Committee to tell her it
was okay. Said the news said, she's allowed the insider trade, but you go to jail if you
do, but she's better than us. She walks on red carpets.
Exactly, and again, that goes back to the Great Awakening. But that caller, that was
perfect what he said because it covered all the points perfectly. Yeah, like you said,
the gangbangers, all these, the rapists, the robbers, they're gonna give up their guns.
Hey, Gerald, I wanna tell people right now, cuz you've gotta leave us, I know. You just
offered to come on and break down your trends that we don't have time to get to. Is your
book there?
Can I tell folks now when you're gonna be on for an hour next week?
I don't know the exact date, but we'll get it to you later on today.
Okay, but just sometime next week you will grace us with your problems.
I promise sometime next week we will make the time to be on.
If I have a red carpet for you. Then it could be tomorrow.
No, listen, I was joking. I'm just having bling and like red carpets, maybe all the-
Yeah, no, I want a red carpet when I show up. No, and it's true because every time you
see these dictators, we'll call them presidents or prime ministers, they always have some
flunky over there dressed up in a costume.
And they're all lined up and they're saluting. Who made this crap up? Who's paying for this?
Get these guys to work.
They're very embarrassing. Gerald, thank you so much. More calls and news, special reports
coming up. There goes Gerald Cilente.

The Alex Jones Show, because there is a war on for your mind.
If you go to infoawars.com or prisonplanet.com, we have different articles up there with the
video in it titled, Demand a Real Plan, documenting that government has been the biggest murderer
in history in the last century, killed over 290 million. I kept saying 260 million. My
memory failed. It was 290 plus million from the university studies that we show in the
Demand a Real Plan five-minute breakdown.
And then under the YouTube video, we have links to the university studies and also comparable
information compiled by Jews, the preservation of firearms ownership. And again, I wanna
thank you for joining us. We are live. It is the fourth day of January 2013. 2013, man,
wow, here we are.
Time is a flying. How fast will this year go by? Now, I went into overdrive so we can
take some more of your phone calls and get some of these special reports. Because these
are the type of reports that are being filed daily on the nightly news, 7 o'clock central.
By the way, you get 11 memberships for 5.95 a month. So you can go create one membership
username passcode, share it with 10 more people who can simultaneously use it.
Social films, the nightly news, so much more, prisonplanet.tv and the tiny bit of money
we make helps fund this operation. So if you're not a member, join us with Operation Awaken
the Sleeping Giant. And again, I'm gonna launch Operation Paul Revere. I'm gonna shoot a video
about it today that'll be on the nightly news and we'll have official rules next week.
This is so much money, $100,000 in the prize that I'm just gonna have a lawyer double check
it cuz I wanna be sure people can be litigious out there. We always pay out on our products.
But I wanna make sure people understand that you're gonna have to officially enter with
us and officially have a contest form you sign up with.
This isn't gonna be just all over the map. $100,000 prize and then the chance to have
us put out your next film with a, I gotta look at the budget, but we're looking at like
a half million dollars for production and promotion. And I know how to put films in
theaters. I've never done it. I'm just too busy to make films. I am planning to make
one this year.
We're gonna try to put it in some theaters, but that takes a lot of work for anybody.
You gotta go on tour, you gotta show it, you gotta do it. So we're here to, the contest
is 100,000 for a film you make, then you just get $100,000. And then we'll also, it fits
all the criteria, put it out and sell it. But I've gotta develop all those final parts
of the plan.
But then you get in the running from the top people in the contest to, we're probably gonna
have three or four different people at the top and come in and make a bunch of films
and try to finance them. That's why it's important to buy the books, the videos, the propure
water filters, the support our sponsors, to become prisonplanet.tv members.
Cuz we take that money and put it back into getting the word out. I mean, I'm up here
saying I'm not turning my guns in no matter what. I mean, I'm willing to have the globalists
come after me and kill me, put me in prison for this, folks. So I mean, I'm doing whatever
I think will devastate the enemy. I mean, we are here to dominate the globalists.
We're not here for status. We're not here for power trips. We're not here for all the
normal worldly stuff. We are here to savagely defend liberty with the First Amendment, savagely
and viciously with no apologies, and with any means legally necessary ahead of civil
war. We're trying to stop that. And so we wanna turn your creative power loose. Look
at how we did a contest for reporters, 5,000 for a female, 5,000 for a male.
Hired three or four other reporters that were in the running. Got them here, the great job
they're doing. Well, the next contest is 100,000, okay? All right, I'm already starting to get
into this. And again, I'm just so busy up here late every night doing news reports and
stuff. I haven't codified the whole rules yet, but I've thought it out.
And so I'll make a video about the generalities and then I'll absolutely get the rules out
by like next Wednesday. We worked over the holidays too. We were here New Year's, day
before New Year's, all that, day after Christmas, whatever. We're not playing games, okay? And
because we understand this is real and the prize we want's liberty.
Our blood, our name, our treasure, it's all on the line, everything. Now I wanna go to
David Knight's report. You just heard Gerald Cilente talking about how this great turning
is coming, this great awakening historically in a cycle. And it's not just one theory that
proves this, there's actually dozens.
But one book that came out in the 80s breaks down the fourth turning. And he's got a clip
from the 90s where they predict the implosion of the market, how it would happen, what would
come out of it, the tyranny, the awakening, the cycles. And there's different ways to
interpret the cycles, but they're definitely there.
And the globalists know their cycles. Brzezinski writes about it. So we're gonna play this
then go to your calls. We're going to the bottom of the hour here at least that long
in overdrive and then back into retransmission at the bottom of the hour when Larry Pratt
joined us, very important intel.
Let's go to David Knight, our reporter and researcher's report, the fourth turning. Full
video for radio listeners posted at prisonplanet.tv right now.
I'm David Knight with the Nightly News. Now this quote was written nine years before the
financial crisis of 2008. But it came from a book that was written in 1990, had the same
ideas from the same authors, 18 years before the financial crisis. The fourth turning is
due to begin shortly after the new millennium, midway through the 00 decade. About the year
2005, a sudden spark will catalyze a crisis mood. Remnants of the old social order will
disintegrate. Political and economic trust will implode. Real hardship will beset the
land with severe distress that could involve questions of class, race, nation and empire.
The very survival of the nation will feel at stake. Sometime before the year 2025, America
will pass through a great gate in history commensurate with the American Revolution,
Civil War and twin emergencies of the Great Depression and World War II. The basis of
this prediction is a cyclical view of history that Strauss and Howe discovered by going
back through American and English history back to the mid 1400s. And they discovered
that just as we have seasons of weather, we have seasons of society. And just as we don't
know the exact date that winter is going to come, or whether it's going to be a harsh
or mild winter, we do know that it's going to follow fall. And we do know the approximate
time that it's going to come. We take a close look at the rhythms of American history. And
in our book, we make the following big prediction that beginning about 10 years from now, America
is due to enter a era of crisis, an era of political and social upheaval that will last
around 20 years or so until the late 2020s. We call this era of fourth turning, and we
think it's going to be a big threshold for the history of our nation. It's going to be
something on par with World War II and the Great Depression are going back the length
of a human lifespan before then the Civil War, the going back the length of another
human lifespan, the American Revolution, it could be a time of tragedy or a time of great
opportunity. What they found was that society will go through four phases of high, awakening,
unraveling and crisis. Humans go through four phases of life, childhood, young adult, midlife
and elderhood. And they noticed generations where people have shared experiences and attitudes
are spaced about 20 years apart. And generations are shaped by where their childhood falls
within the phases of society. Now this got my attention because I noticed that there
was a repeating pattern of about 72 years between significant dates in American history
as well as some other histories. For example, if you go from the time the US Constitution
was written in 1789 to the beginning of the Civil War, 1861, that's 72 years. Another
72 years takes us to 1933, the beginning of the New Deal, another major transformation
of American society. If you go another 72 years, that took us to about 2005, exactly
where Strauss and Howe had predicted a major crisis and change would occur. And in addition,
if you look at the Russian Revolution, from 1917 to 1989 was about 72 years. So it seemed
to fit with a life cycle of humans. In a cycle, four generations, 20 years apart, are shaped
by when their childhood falls within that cycle. And the names they use in their book,
The Fourth Turning, come from the biblical account of Exodus. For example, we have one
generation as a prophet generation. Now think of Moses calling a generation to change, the
next generation, the nomad generation, wandering in the wilderness, a period of crisis and
restlessness. The following generation would be a hero generation. Think of the Joshua
generation taking a promised land. That often involves a major war. And then finally, an
artist generation, the generation that builds a new society. Well, where does Strauss and
Howe think that we are in this cycle? The researchers see the millennial generation,
those born between 1982 to 2004, as the hero generation. And they see our society entering
a fourth turning, a crisis period where society will be fundamentally transformed as it was
with the American Revolution, the Civil War, or the New Deal. And the last time we faced
a fourth turning was the Great Depression and World War Two. Strauss and Howe's predictions
of 22 years ago now look prescient. We can see the storm surge coming in our society
at our time, just as if a hurricane was approaching the shore. Now our government has been undermining
the foundations of liberty for a long time. And the question is, will you be a sandbag
to help hold up and protect liberty? Or will you stand by as it gets swept away and we
enter a new dark age of authoritarianism? I'm David Knight for the Infowars Nightly
News.
Excellent job, David Knight. We're gonna skip this network break and take phone calls
here. Again, lot of other special reports right now being filed every couple hours at
prisonplanet.tv as we fight the construction of the prison planet. So we have to recognize
what's bad to then enter the new.
We've studied history. People say, what's the solution? Recognize evil and then stand
against it. What allows evil to take over? Laying down. You want solution? Stop kissing
government rumpus. The government is now run by evil. Does it mean every representative
of it is an evil person?
No, but they are forces of Mordor. We've been taken. America's run by foreign banks. Wake
up to that, restore the republic. Don't wake up, no hope. Very simple. You give aid and
comfort to the foreign occupation forces when you sit there and make excuses for it. Or
think anything it's doing is reasonable or nice.
It's all about controlling you, Georgia and Connecticut. Contest for gun control, he has
some comments on that. Go ahead and thanks for holding, sir.
Good speaking to you. I think this whole thing is basically engineered because they're trying
to, because of the financial collapse. I mean, so they can basically get the little gangs
that can basically come into our communities once we're gun-free and able to be victimized
so that we have to run to these big gangsters, Mr. Big, for the collapse.
No, no, that's it. I don't know. Absolutely. They admit that's the plan, yeah?
So I mean, most people got to be, we've got to raise the awareness of everybody. And I'm
glad you're having a contest, but I think we should also have something like, why not
get, say the Sandy Hook, or Sandy, is it Sandy Hook? Not again, Sandy-
Sandy Hook.
Whatever, where the shooting was done in Connecticut. Have them brought together with people from
Waco and Ruby Ridge and people like that, and the people who have survived shootings
where they had guns, and say, look, this is where it should go.
Sure, well that's why they let the media harass them, then the police take over, and won't
let anybody get near the families so they can control the narrative. That's problem
reaction solution, but here's the deal. We're gonna have a $5,000 one month contest to do
this quickly. $5,000, one winner, that'll be announced tonight as well, and people can
start going right now, but it doesn't matter, everybody wins.
Putting out a video, demand a plan video, that basically defends the Second Amendment
along the lines of the video we put out. It can be anything you want, any style, anything,
a $5,000 contest for the Second Amendment. Then we're going to have a $100,000 contest
where you can make any film on any liberty issue you want, one minute, two hours, whatever,
fiction, non-fiction. And then I will judge, as the sole judge, who the winner is.
And then out of that, you'll get hundreds of great films made. Everybody wins by getting
the word out, fighting tyranny and creativity. Somebody else gets $100,000, and then I take
the top five or six people. And the top person, because the winner won't necessarily get the
film deal, we have to work that out.
But we're gonna try to put out a bunch of different films of different budgets, depending
on how much money we have. But we're planning to just launch everything at the enemy. We've
got our platform ready now, and we're just gonna have a major offensive. And it doesn't
mean that our offensive will win, but we will inspire others to have offensives.
I mean, just like this guy this last week who put out a video showing all these Hollywood
stars shooting people in movies, cut between saying turn our guns in. That's been all over
TV everywhere, it's totally destroying the enemy. And it's just another punch. We're
gonna fire, and fire, and fire, and fire, and fire, and fire. Anything else, sir?
Yeah, I thought we should also put poison pills in every one of their bills. How about
adding on to each one of these gun bills that they're trying to put in there that they have
to repeal, what is it, the NDAA?
NDAA, yeah, or abolish the Federal Reserve. Or that all federal buildings have to be gun
free and they can't have bodyguards, disarm the Secret Service. And they'll go, well,
that's ridiculous. Exactly, leave our guns alone, filth. You've already sucked the country
dry.
Well, we know you hate us. You're not getting our guns, we know you're criminals. Shut up,
shut up, the game's over. Shut up, Chelsea. Shut up, Stalin. Shut up, New World Order.
Shut up, Queen of England. Shut up, Al Jazeera. Shut up, RT. Shut up, Chinese government.
Shut up, shut up. We're not putting up with it anymore. I appreciate your call. Shut
up, scum. Let's go ahead and talk to Julio in Illinois. Thanks for holding her on the
air.
Happy New Year, Alex, and everyone listening. I was planning on heading out to your neck
of the woods this weekend out in Austin. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like I'll be able to do so.
But there's a major conference, the American Meteorological Society is having a conference
beginning Sunday through Thursday-
I'm glad you raised this. I told them months ago I want to send reporters and the problem
is we forget. Yes, our reporters work like seven days a week by choosing because they
love liberty so much. Somebody needs to go to the weather modification conference because
RT came out yesterday and said, we're making it up.
There's no weather mod. They're not spraying anything. Did you know that, Julio? The Russians
said, shut up. So shut up. Sorry.
No worries, Alex. I saw that video this morning and I've been planning research for the last
couple of months in preparation for this conference and there's going to be people from various
universities throughout the country as well as-
Conference doesn't exist. There's no NAFTA highway. They're not coming for our guns.
We're bad people. We shouldn't be upset, Julio. We should just trust our government and turn
everything over to them. And of course, we need to go to government facilities and work
in labor together. Together, aren't you for the people? Don't you want to prove you're
for America and go work in a forced labor camp, Julio?
I mean, the army manual says they're setting them up. I mean, what's wrong with a FEMA
camp? What's wrong with quote, reeducation centers? We shouldn't be upset about that,
Julio. Are you ready to apologize?
I am apologizing, Alex. Actually, remember I called your show back in November of 2011.
I think during the Cancun conference, the UN climate change conference in Cancun, they
said that they want to move us into mass camps in large urban areas.
No, no, that's in the official document. But no, the UN doesn't exist either. You're a
conspiracy theorist. No, none of it exists. They're good people. I appreciate your call.
How dare you say government doesn't do anything but good. When the government goes and gets
on the toilet, flowers come out, okay? And if you say anything else, you're a terrorist.
I think it's normal to put gun owners' names in the paper and tell people where to go rob
them and say they're scum and say that all gun owners are Klan members. Obviously, that's
true. I mean, the government is good.
Patty in Wyoming, how are you doing, ma'am?
Hi, Alex, how are you? God bless you. And God is calling out his army and we all need
to pray for each other. And I really enjoyed the commentary with you and Gerald. It was
very informative and a real privilege to listen to such brilliant men.
Ma'am, you know where roses come from, right? I'm sorry, go ahead.
I'm sorry.
That's okay. Listen, I just wanted to reiterate and agree with what Gerald said earlier about
psychotropic drugs. I'm a registered nurse and I actually experience that weekly in my
profession that the inappropriate prescribing of these medications, the over-prescribing
of these medications, and especially, most criminally, prescribing these medications
to children.
Yeah, I've been reading where they're giving anti-psychotics to three-year-olds now. What's
wrong with that? I mean, next you're gonna say it wasn't good to shoot 15,000 black people
up with live syphilis?
Yeah, it's criminal. It's absolutely-
No, you're a criminal for not liking it. The government did it. And the government injects
black people to kill them. It's good.
Yeah.
I mean, what are you, a fear monger? You don't trust the government?
No, I guess I am. I'm just a bee vendetta, mask-wearing, radical nut who needs to go
to a re-education camp.
Ma'am, I agree with you. Ecoscience says they've been poisoning our water and I think it's
good. Of course, we need to be poisoned by the government. The government's poisoning.
It's good.
It's very biblical. The truth has become the lie and the lie has become the truth in the
end times and I really believe that.
That's right. And Diane Feinstein wants our guns cuz she cares about us. Thank you, extremist.
That lady was so extreme. ABC Angel, you're on the air. Go ahead.
Yeah, Alex, this is Archangel in Pittsburgh.
Go ahead.
Hey, I was just had a long talk with Mark Kessler, who's the Gilbertan chief of police.
We had a long talk and by the way, you neglected his direct no phone number, his 570-
Hold on, let's not give the police chief's number out.
Said it would be fine.
No, no, let's not. We got millions of listeners, bro. You're talking about the police chief
that's saying he's gonna have a pro-second amendment zone in his town.
Yeah.
He's on the show Sunday. I didn't wanna announce it, cuz I like surprises, but he's on the
show Sunday, right? He's already set up?
Yeah, he was really happy. We had a long discussion about it. I told him about my ideas. He said
he had sent it out to other mayors. I had said about the legislature and the Senate,
the Governor Tom Corbett also mentioned that in the 70s or 80s years, they made the legal
militia illegal.
Sir, that police chief does not exist and this phone call does not exist. And Piers
Morgan cares about you and your family.
The Pennsylvania House and Senate reinstate the legal militia. That would give it to Bill
Teeth, cuz there's over 2 million hunters and sportsmen registered just to hunt in Pennsylvania.
I agree. We need more police chiefs to come out and say, we are gonna defend the Constitution
and Bill of Rights.
And we need the states to defend our borders. It's time to understand we have an occupied
government. And this has happened dozens of times in modern history, like Romania and
places where everybody just stops complying, okay? And police, you name it, they can't
get you all.
I know they persecute police that aren't oppressive in most areas. You've got to just get together
and start saying no, cuz there's no future. The globalists will steal everything if we
don't stand up against them right now. Let's go to Ron in New York real fast. Ron, you're
on the air.
Yeah, hi, Alex. Alex, a few things. How come there's been no real consequential journalistic
vetting of Adam Lanza's mother? I mean, after all, according to the press, she played a
central part-
Listen, the whole thing, if you ask me, my gut tells me it's all staged, and the Batman
shooting too, and we've got the proof. But I don't know if the public can handle it.
The entire thing is scripted, yes.
Second question is, why is the mayor of New York City, the mayor of a city, having a quote
secret meeting with the former representative Gabrielle Giffords and her husband Mark, as
though he's sending her out on some secret mission they won't discuss? And an interesting
thing about her husband Mark, back in the 90s, the man was nothing more than a naval
aviator. Nothing more than a naval aviator, and I can't see the connection. He was part
of a trade, some kind of a trade group that went to the People's Republic of China, government
sanctions-
Absolutely. God bless you, brother. We're out of time.
