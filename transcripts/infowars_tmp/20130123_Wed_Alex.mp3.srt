1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:32,160
he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.

3
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:38,080
I spent some of the morning watching C-SPAN and Rand Paul grilling Hillary Clinton,

4
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:45,600
pointing out that if he was the president, he would have relieved her of her position.

5
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:52,240
We have that clip coming up. And that's the point. When quote, government screwed up in the past,

6
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:59,200
or in any other country for that matter, the people responsible for it resign or go to jail.

7
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,360
But nowadays, the answer is give us more funding. And that's what Hillary Clinton said.

8
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:11,680
That's why whenever FEMA ordered the police to stand down during Katrina on Bush's watch,

9
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,120
FEMA then got even more funding saying we need more power.

10
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:23,040
They've engineered that into the system. It's just an amazing level of corruption.

11
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:30,800
But you see, watching the Senate hearings with Hillary, only part of it is being covered.

12
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:38,160
Because our government armed the Libyan al-Qaeda rebels out of Saudi Arabia,

13
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:42,240
who first came from Saudi Arabia and other countries, into Benghazi two years ago,

14
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:48,560
to destabilize and take down Libya. They were on the BBC saying, next stop, Damascus, Syria.

15
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,640
They've been there. They've been given heat-seeking missiles.

16
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,040
Some numbers are as high as 15,000. Most numbers are around 12,000.

17
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:02,480
10,000 of those heat seekers, pretty high tech. Take down any jet airliner you want.

18
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:07,200
They've been attacking jet airliners, shooting them up, passenger liners.

19
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,880
And then the media thinks you're so stupid, they go, we have to give our rights up and

20
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:17,920
invade all over Africa and Algeria and Mali because al-Qaeda's there.

21
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,960
And then our criminal-occupied government uses that as a pretext with NATO and France

22
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:28,480
to invade Mali and Algeria and other areas. I mean, it's amazing. We predicted,

23
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,120
four years ago in the Obama deception, they would use al-Qaeda that they control

24
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,240
to invade all over Africa because we know how they operate. And we saw the buildup of AFRICON.

25
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:45,520
So the truth is 100% in plain sight. The truth is 100% in plain sight.

26
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:51,920
The truth is 100% in plain view, but it's so over the top, everyone would have to say,

27
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,400
you're right, Alex, we apologize. The globalists have hijacked our country around al-Qaeda.

28
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,120
And the media spins that and says, you're saying George W. Bush had a plunger at the World Trade

29
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,920
Center. You're saying everybody in the government, the guy that delivers letters to your post office

30
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:12,880
box, he's behind it. That's the games they play. No, criminal, globalist, cartel elements,

31
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:17,840
infiltrating the CIA, FBI, NSA, the National Security Council.

32
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,680
They financed the politicians that get into power, the foreign banks.

33
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:27,600
They have put their people in, and they're using al-Qaeda to destabilize and overthrow governments

34
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:32,160
or attack Western governments as a pretext for the Western government to then crack down

35
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,800
the general population. And I've been saying that for 11 years, and now it's all public.

36
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:44,080
Oh, don't worry about al-Qaeda. This is now for the general public.

37
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,760
So we're going to be breaking all of that down today. And then there's articles like

38
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:54,480
this out of CNS News. Former Special Forces Commander, top general, was US running guns

39
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:02,960
to Syrian rebels via Benghazi? CIA says no. General Boykin goes on to say that the evidence

40
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:09,040
points towards them doing this. Well, the evidence doesn't point towards it, it's on

41
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:15,840
record that our government, NATO, all run by the mega banks, on record, brought al-Qaeda

42
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,000
into Libya, then brought them into Syria, invaded from three different countries, and

43
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,200
have had Turkish artillery backing them up, and CIA commandos, and British commandos,

44
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:34,560
and Saudi Arabian commandos, in there, helping attack, over the last 20 plus months, Syria.

45
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:40,160
I mean, the Turkish ambassador was there, the missile cache was there, there was some

46
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,400
double cross, or they wanted to get rid of the witness to it, and they killed the ambassador

47
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,400
in order to stand down for eight hours. And the people they used to kill in the al-Qaeda

48
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:55,360
forces were the US certified, NATO certified security for Benghazi. Okay, that's what happened,

49
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:19,840
open and shut, period, done, and the whole government knows it.

50
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,240
Destroy the causes of many serious diseases, such as strep, staph, pneumonia, colds,

51
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,120
flus, and other harmful pathogens. This new technology has the ability to terminate entire

52
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:40,320
colonies of harmful bacteria at several hundred times the effectiveness of colloidal or ionic

53
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,960
silver solutions. The Science Digest Journal says silver is our mightiest germ fighter.

72

Rallying patriots worldwide. You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.

73
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:36,720
Welcome ladies and gentlemen. It is the 23rd day of January 2013 on this Wednesday edition.

74
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,200
Coming up at the bottom of the hour because we're tracking it live right now. We'll give

75
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:48,080
you the latest on Hillary Clinton's testimony to the Senate Committee. Rand Paul to Hillary

76
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,800
Clinton. If I were a president, I would have relieved you of your post. We're going to be

77
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:59,520
going over that. Former Special Forces Commander, retired General William G. Boykin,

78
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:06,880
who literally was at the heart of the CIA and black operations, is saying that he believes

79
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:13,840
that they were funding and giving missiles and weapons to Al Qaeda-based Syrian rebels.

80
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,120
Well, I mean, that's not even debatable. That's like saying, I believe the sun came up this

81
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:25,280
morning. I mean, it's New York Times, Associated Press, LA Times in the last six months, Council

82
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:29,280
on Foreign Relations. We told you about it 22 months ago when the whole thing started.

83
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:35,920
It's a plan to turn the entire Middle East over to Wahhabist, Al Qaeda run by Saudi Arabia,

84
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:41,520
itself run by the mega banks. So at the bottom of the hour, I'll do a special report on that

85
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:45,040
and give you the latest. In fact, we have a skeleton crew today. One of our guys is out

86
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:52,800
taking care of a sick child. It's in yesterday's stack. Can you guys re-pull the London Independent

87
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:58,000
and a couple others where the Prime Minister of Algeria is saying the West is behind these

88
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,320
stage terror attacks as a pretext to invade our countries? There's guys with blonde hair and blue

89
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:08,000
eyes attacking our facilities. And then they pull out and then the West gets to come in.

90
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,440
See, I've seen this over and over again. Operation Gladio, Ajax, Tonkin,

91
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:19,760
staging events are even having real attacks. Northwoods talks about shooting up Americans

92
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:26,800
in shopping malls and movie theaters and on the streets. Declassified in 2000, September 2000.

93
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:32,640
And the plan was killed by President Kennedy, but later given a new name and engaged him.

94
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,520
That's why we have to say, could these events be staged? And then when they have the telltale signs,

95
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:44,960
then it moves into, it's a probability they are, especially Colorado. I mean, that is cartoon level

96
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:50,160
where he's getting DARPA funding and mind control. He's got a top Air Force psychiatrist who'd been

97
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:56,000
the head of whole operations at entire bases in San Antonio. Over him, meeting with him multiple

98
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,360
times a week. They're talking about national security and the police don't want. It released

99
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:07,920
his workbook with her, where he reportedly was planning to do all this. You want me to keep going?

100
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:13,200
Witnesses of multiple shooters, all the rest of it. Him in the jail saying, I don't remember who

101
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:19,040
I am, obviously drugged out of his mind. I mean, we already knew this, but it came out in the LA

102
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:29,120
Times that Theodore Kaczynski, the Unabomber, was under CIA mind control. And it was declassified

103
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:36,960
that he had been a volunteer to MK Ultra and had disappeared into the program for close to 30

104
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:42,960
years. He entered it in the mid 60s as a PhD student, disappears for decades, and starts

105
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:52,240
bombing prominent scientists and people. And his letters are how we've got to exterminate

106
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,960
the majority of humanity or they're going to destroy the Earth, but the elite are planning

107
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:00,160
to kill us anyways, so we've got to stop that. I mean, what is this?

108
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:08,880
And the media is like, Alex Jones thinks it's mind control, no such thing. I mean,

109
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:13,840
they probably had more than 30 mainstream articles, Daily Beast, you name it. Time

110
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:19,360
Magazine saying for some reason, Jones went and watched Batman and found Sandy Hook in it,

111
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:25,600
and now says it's behind it. No, no, we said before Batman came out that from analyzing it

112
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,560
and the previous franchise, it is a film full of psychological triggers.

113
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:35,920
And then the movie comes out and Sandy Hook's in it. And then we find out hundreds of media people

114
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:42,480
were mailed Bain command charts showing the mass terror attack points like Sandy Hook and others.

115
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:49,440
They're like, well, this is bizarre. I know it's bizarre. This is the gang signs

116
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,760
the globalists also use to communicate with each other. I don't believe in all this,

117
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,880
they do. I don't go to Bohemian Grove and worship a big owl.

118
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:06,400
I'm not Jimmy Savelle, the top royal confidant, who it turns out is a Satanist and a mass child

119
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:11,360
molester running big children's charities and hanging out and having keys and the highest

120
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:17,120
national security clearances into the royal family and bragging, I supply them things.

121
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:23,280
And they've declared national security on that. They just declared national security on him,

122
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:30,160
quote, supplying things. He publicly brag at elite parties with the Prime Minister's

123
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:37,760
and the Queen and Prince Charles and all of them. And the guy is a devil worshiping pedophile.

124
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,280
And by the way, I've analyzed that the main banking structure is moving to Frankfurt,

125
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:53,600
Germany. This is high level blackmail by the European Illuminati against the British Empire.

126
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,280
High level wars going on. That's why this is being released now that he's dead.

127
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:02,400
This has been known for decades at the BBC where he worked. And they're now going,

128
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:06,800
you're gonna do what we say, we're gonna run the New World Order. Cuz the Skeksis are all battling

129
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:13,920
over the throne right now. The New World Order is almost complete. It's entering the endgame.

130
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,880
It's entering the endgame. And now they're gonna start battling over who gets the throne,

131
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,560
who gets the ring of Mordor, of Morgoth.

132
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,840
And you wonder why everything they do is so diabolical and so twisted and so

133
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:36,320
evil and so sick and so filthy. I mean, if you're a new listener and you're like, well,

134
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:45,920
who's Jimmy Savelle? Well, who's Jerry Sandusky? Raping children in front of people at high noon

135
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:51,280
in a field house, which is like the main entrance of an airport.

136
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,560
You've never been inside a field house. I mean, it's people coming and going constantly,

137
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,640
even at night, especially to college.

138
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,760
And then of course it came out higher, the whole top of the university was covering it up.

139
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:11,520
Of course, he was just the procurer of the children. You're like, man, Alex,

140
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:16,480
why are you telling us this? Because they're monsters, that's why. You don't get into the

141
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:22,800
club with these people unless you are very, very, very, very sick.

142
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,040
And I've talked a lot about this because he wrote about it. Hitler loved to go to the front

143
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:35,120
in Poland and France and then with Russia until they started getting beaten.

144
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,600
Then he pulled back to the wolf's lair, the wolf's den,

145
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:50,880
his forest bunkers. And he would sit there with big telescopes from 10 miles away.

146
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,560
But with a big telescope, crystal clear, watching people getting killed,

147
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:59,920
watching things burn, watching people jumping out of tall windows. And they say he would stay up

148
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:07,040
sometimes for days taking amphetamines and eating pastry after pastry. He could not draw himself

149
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:14,800
away from watching his bombers bomb and burn major cities. And he just described it as absolutely

150
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:26,080
beautiful. And so you need to figure out, folks, if you don't tie government down with the chains

151
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:31,440
of the Bill of Rights and Constitution, if you don't put government on a very short leash,

152
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:38,960
it will put you on one. And I just went off into,

153
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:47,120
and I'll cover it at the bottom of the hour after I get to Nightline at the bottom of the hour.

154
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:53,840
I heard that last week, but then I was leaving town Thursday night to go out to the desert to

155
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:59,360
do some hiking with my son and others. And would have brought my daughter, they're too

156
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,880
little to hike four miles up a mountain. I'm surprised he did it, he did a pretty good job.

157
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,680
We were ready to turn back anytime he wanted to, but he said he wanted to go to the top.

158
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:19,760
Rob Dew's son, who's even younger, climbed it too. So I heard you had Nightline

159
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:25,520
did a piece on you, and I just figured it would be the piece they did two and a half years ago.

160
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,720
And it is the old piece, but they added some new stuff to it.

161
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:40,320
And it's another window into the mindset of these guys, because in the piece coming up,

162
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:46,960
and I'm gonna recap this, you'll notice that he says, now I say, well, first you guys said

163
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,920
there wasn't a world government. And now you're just saying, well, it's not a bad world government.

164
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:57,520
And he goes, I'm not even saying there is a world government. Like what he says is what makes

165
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:03,760
reality. Like when your child tells you, I didn't drink milk out of the jug, and you've got a

166
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:12,000
mustache, I just saw you do it. Don't lie to me. And it's the same thing, and I say, that's why

167
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,920
you're discredited. See, what you don't know is, 30 minutes before, they wanted to go shoot outside

168
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:24,320
of the local park. 30 minutes before, we're in my office, right in out there, with a bunch of clips

169
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,800
lined up of world leaders describing world government, congressional record on world government,

170
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:34,960
CFR quotes, where they said it, what bi-monthly foreign affairs journal they said it.

171
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,960
And I had it all for him, and he watched a few clips, and he goes, well, that's a different

172
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,680
world government. That's a good world government, not the world government you're talking about.

173
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:47,680
So 30 minutes later, I'm out there in a park where they wanna do a different part of the interview.

174
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,440
And I go, first you say there's no world government, now you're saying it's not a bad

175
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,200
world government, it's a different world government. He goes, no, I'm not even agreeing

176
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:00,720
that there is one. And that's why I say, that's why you're discredited.

177
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:07,120
But people watching that, see, I'm talking to him like he's a real person. And then he said,

178
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:12,400
I went to dinner with him and I was nice. So that discredits me cuz I'm not this wild man

179
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:18,240
in person. I was trying as a human to communicate with them cuz the guy's the host of ABC Nightly

180
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:23,920
News. And that's still got four or five million viewers a night.

181
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:28,000
That's still got some of the big old numbers of Dinosaur Media, one of the only bastions

182
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:36,400
of it. Nightline has got two or three million. And I'm sitting there, and I'm sitting there

183
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:42,240
like, and then they use that in the piece like, behind the scenes he was nice. And look,

184
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,640
here he is throwing a football and he doesn't know anybody's watching. And my memory serves,

185
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,640
they go, what's this football? You play football like that was bad. I go, yeah, with my son.

186
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:56,000
We're like, here, let's toss it. I mean, they knew that that was being videotaped.

187
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,920
They imply that I was secretly throwing a football. I mean, it's bizarre.

188
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:06,320
Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive from natural disasters like Hurricane

189
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:11,200
Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on by a disastrous

190
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:16,080
economy? Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything. At eFoods Direct, we hear from

193
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:31,600
are closed, but I managed to get my eFoods just in time to be able to help my sister and niece.

194
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:36,480

208
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,440
going to see economic growth, slide into a recession, or at worst, depression? Hi, Ted

209
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:12,480
Anderson from Midas Resources. We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves

210
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:17,200
in a move towards safety is prudent. When the market becomes volatile, US Treasuries are a safe

211
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:22,560
haven. But what do you do when the US government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?

212
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:27,920
Many investors are turning toward gold as a common sense alternative to traditional paper investments.

213
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:33,280

out about money and blasted by the electric environment. Hi, I'm Pastor Jenny and that was

219
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:12,640
the state I was in back in 2010. Then I learned about RNA drops. I learned that 97% of my DNA

220
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,520
that scientists have called junk is actually packed with millions of gene switches that play

221
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:22,640
a critical role in controlling how my cells, organs, and other tissues behave. I learned

222
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,720
I don't have to put up with disease decay or decline like I'd been conditioned to believe.

223
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:32,880
I began taking RNA drops, a 100% natural formula designed to turn on those switches and provide

224
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:38,160
me with amazing health and joy. Learn more about RNA drops and order a free sample today.

228
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:28,160
And when the system honors people that are subservient and go along to get along,

229
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:34,720
it creates a perfect environment for the pathogen of very despotic megalomaniacal

230
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:42,960
tyranny and tyrants to take control. And that's history. And that's what's so frustrating is that

231
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:48,000
I sat there this morning for about an hour playing with my four-year-old daughter.

232
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:57,120
And playing with the stuffed animals and playing with my little pony and playing hide-and-go-seek.

233
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,640
And I sat there while she was in her room after about an hour of playing with her. And I was

234
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,880
going to tell her I had to go. I knew she was going to beg me not to leave. And I just thought,

235
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:14,880
how do I take this stillness, this understanding that I have right now of how the world works

236
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:22,640
and this deep sorrow and pain that is such a strength? And how do I transmit that and

237
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:29,840
decipher that and encode that in words so that the general public can understand what I'm saying?

238
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:34,400
But I know that by saying that fathers and mothers and grandmothers and grandfathers

239
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:39,920
and brothers and sisters and sons and daughters, once the man, twice the child taking care of

240
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:45,280
their parents, you know what I'm talking about, that all I wanna do is protect her.

241
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:55,280
All I wanna do is have a good world for her. All I wanna do is lift up others so that she can

242
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:59,920
commune with them and her grandchildren with their grandchildren and their grandchildren with

243
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:08,000
their great-great-grandchildren. And it hurts me to my core that humanity may not make it.

244
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,960
We may not get to the point of a type one civilization, meaning we could survive if

245
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:20,880
this planet was destroyed, and the incredible destiny that God has for us. If we don't stand

246
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:26,640
up and do the right thing, God gave us a brain, God gave us a soul, a heart, and the power of

247
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:34,640
his image as creators to build amazing things. And I know how great humanity is.

248
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:41,360
And I can't imagine the world we would be in if the leaders of this planet were actually trying

249
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:47,280
to empower humanity. They claim all day that their mission is to empower people. They claim

250
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:51,200
all day, I watch clips, I've already seen them, but I watched a compilation

251
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:58,560
at about 7 AM this morning of Joe Biden, we have it, if we have time later, we're gonna play it.

252
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:04,160
Joe Biden, we have it, if we have time later, we're gonna play it.

253
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:11,120
Of Joe Biden with relish, I mean, when you have discernment, it's not even discernment,

254
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:17,200
anybody would see it. The relish he has when he talks about these beautiful children,

255
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:24,800
shawl, shot up, just riddled with holes, riddled with holes. And he's clearly using it,

256
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,560
pressing on the wound, putting salt in the wound, feeding off of it.

257
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:33,120
I know his history, I know his background, I know how evil he is, I know how he works to

258
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:38,800
deindustrialize America. I know how bad these guys are, I know their mindset, their code.

259
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,680
And he's sitting there just sticking his finger in the wound like a bullet hole.

260
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:49,360
And you say, I know it hurts. We finally, the image of these four-year-olds aren't even four.

261
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:56,160
All shot up full of bullet holes. This with the parents, we're gonna get this done. And I realize

262
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:02,160
they got drones killing in one country alone last year, 200 plus kids, Pakistan. Just seeing all

263
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:07,120
collateral damage and putting al-Qaeda in Libya and Syria, 40,000 dead at least.

264
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:13,440
Lining up blacks, videos of black men, women and children with al-Qaeda, because it's cheaper to

265
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:18,080
use machetes. And plus they have more fun doing it, just hacking them up, just hacking their

266
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:23,360
noses off, hacking their arms as they beg. I mean, stuff we won't even show you, it's on YouTube.

267
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:27,280
They try to take it down as fast as they can, taking Christians and throwing them off

268
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:31,360
five-story buildings and chopping their heads off and celebrating and saying,

269
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:36,240
we're gonna destroy America, a la Akbar 9-11. We're coming, we've got the missiles,

270
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:42,080
we're gonna kill you next. And our government, foreign banks, that's who they are, the occupiers,

271
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:47,440
are doing this. And then I go and TSA wants me to take my shoes off and grope me to see if I'm

272
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:53,680
al-Qaeda. I mean, I'm like, look, game over, joke over, scam over, no, no, no, no.

273
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:59,120
And I realized why I blew up at Piers Morgan, I am physically angry.

274
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:04,800
And not even at a hate level, it's more of just the anger of trying to burst through a foot of

275
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:09,440
ice that you're trapped under. If you fall through a frozen lake, I mean, it's that kind of anger.

276
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:15,680
I want out of here, I don't like this, get off my back. It's that feeling where two or three bullies

277
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:20,240
are beating you up, and they get you down and they got you tackled. And you get beyond mad,

278
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:24,320
you go, these people aren't gonna be on me in a minute. And you just decide to get up and stomp

279
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:29,440
them. It's that kind of feeling like, I don't care anymore what happens to me. You people want

280
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:36,240
to abuse children. You're a bunch of sick filth, and I will not stand here and watch you like

281
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:42,080
ghouls use those little kids' deaths to disarm the American people. By the way, Australia took

282
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:48,080
everything but single shot bolt action. They're now set to ban those. It's always the same story.

283
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:56,400
We'll be back. We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.

284
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:04,560
You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.

285
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:09,680
Tyranny is here. The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.

286
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:14,720
It really says that the state is God. The United States is now recognized globally

287
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:19,680
as one of the most impressive police states on earth. This film conclusively proves the

288
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:25,440
existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide. This documentary

289
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:30,400
exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all powerful shadow state.

290
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:34,640
Police state four chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.

292
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:46,560
citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner. It's only the beginning of the New

293
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:53,200

300
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:34,720
gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and leave the silver at the surface. But rather,

301
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:39,920
we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera

302
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:44,560
to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the silver more effectively.

That's www.supernaturalsilver.com.

314
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:54,620
dot com is really on top of it. They're not bringing up, hey, why did our government use

315
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:57,200
al-Qaeda to overthrow Libya to begin with?

316
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:03,320
I mean, it's on record that NATO is arming them, and our military is the heart of NATO.

317
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:09,640
So we need to be honest with ourselves about this, because if all this information is forced

318
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:15,340
out there into the general consciousness and general awareness, it's game over. The establishment

319
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:21,240
thinks you're so unconscious, so stupid, they're using real al-Qaeda out of Saudi Arabia, Qatar

320
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:26,560
and other countries, brought in over two years ago to Libya to start a almost year-long civil

321
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:34,480
war with air raids and bombings of major cities and laying waste to whole neighborhoods.

322
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:47,600
And it was called humanitarian because Obama is a Peace Prize winner. Just amazing. And

323
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:51,720
then they use that same group and publicly exported them to Turkey, Jordan, and other

324
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:56,600
areas to have them infiltrate the country publicly in attack. And they've got, this

325
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:00,000
has been admitted for over a year in mainstream media, but it's back in the newspaper that

326
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,040
Western commandos are advising them and training them. I mean, there are US bases in Turkey

327
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:09,580
right on the border, and then the Syrians battle back against them.

328
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:15,360
And so they open up for a few weeks with artillery to clear the area to send in the jihadis.

329
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:24,960
And then I've seen some conservatives go, well, good, we got Arabs killing Arabs. And

330
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:30,120
that's some bad karma right there. I don't mean karma in the Indian fashion, but you

331
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:36,200
reap what you sow, what comes around goes around. I mean, really? That kind of so-called

332
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,680
conservative is not a conservative.

333
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:47,440
They are a fascistic, warped, dehumanizing person who has visions of power and reflected

334
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:53,260
glory by smart bombs and artillery. I bet you a million dollars if you took one of those

335
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:57,580
so-called good old boys, cuz most of them aren't really good old boys. And you stuck

336
00:35:57,580 --> 00:36:02,840
a gun in their hand and lined up ten little Afghan kids with snot coming out their nose

337
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:05,120
or little eyes looking up at you.

338
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:12,120
So ignorant that most of them can't even find the US on a map. I mean, these are like cavemen.

339
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:16,000
I bet you those people would not have the nerve to pull the trigger on one of those

340
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:21,200
kids, much less all ten of them. And if they did, they'd be basket cases and commit suicide

341
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:24,280
later, like our troops do, by the way.

342
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:28,320
You're not meant to go and kill a bunch of innocent kids. Your body, unless you're a

343
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:35,120
full-born psychopath, genetically, if you're not totally evil and totally given over to

344
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:42,260
evil from birth, doing evil things like that will destroy you. You will destroy yourself.

345
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:47,400
Your body will hit the self-destruct switch. When you do good, you feel empowered and the

346
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:53,520
universe opens up to you. When you do evil, you destroy yourself. That's a universal law.

347
00:36:53,520 --> 00:37:01,060
You don't have to even believe in God to know that that's the case.

348
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:04,480
And our military men and women, most of them got in because they were poor or they had

349
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:09,200
military background families or they genuinely cared about society and wanted to help. A

350
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:14,840
small percentage, they become the contractors in a lot of cases, enjoy psychopathic killing.

351
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:20,760
It's a place where they can go out and kill and get paid to do it. And they believe it's

352
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:29,800
manly. Well, it might be manly if you've got to fight for your tribe to fight other men.

353
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:35,020
But it is not manly to be like basically aliens from another planet with incredibly super

354
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:41,360
high-tech weapons to come into Stone Age areas with people that don't even know who you are

355
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:45,560
or your country is. They've done studies who will fight you just because they're still

356
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,560
humans.

357
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:51,600
They're primitive humans, but they still have their human programming. If there are invaders,

358
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:59,180
I better fight them, which is what any group of humans has always done. And the globalist

359
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:03,520
hire a bunch of Muslim terrorists to stage attacks, to carry out real attacks, or to

360
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,960
take the Blamford attacks to attack the West so they can take all of our liberties.

361
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,880
And I'm already getting into Benghazi now. We got two big guests today. We have Dr.

362
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:16,560
Jim Garib, who's run the program to save 30 plus thousand Chinese girls. He's been nominated

363
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:22,360
for the Nobel Prize. He says he's talked to a top military retired officer who told him

364
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:26,180
that Obama is doing a litmus test, will you fire on US citizens?

365
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:29,320
Now I believe he talked to this person, they told him that. In the article he wrote about

366
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:35,200
it, adds the fact that they're buying a billion six bullets, armored vehicles, and the new

367
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:40,760
army manuals. And so 10 say, train them to court in cities, confiscate guns, and shoot

368
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:47,120
Americans. I can play ABC Nightly News in Katrina with the army officer saying, if you

369
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,160
don't turn your guns in, we kill Americans.

370
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:55,600
And by the way, a lot of that went on. It's the same ABC piece where the police chief

371
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:59,120
says, all the guns will be taken, no one will be allowed to be armed. You just type in gun

372
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:04,280
confiscation, New Orleans, there's NRA videos with millions of views on YouTube. If you're

373
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:07,080
a new listener, I'm not gonna play it again, I've probably played it 100 times in the last

374
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,960
six, seven years since Katrina, I'm not playing it again.

375
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:15,080
You know it's there. For a couple of weeks, people denied gun confiscation was even happening.

376
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:21,600
So he's gonna be joining us and then the main host of the Young Turks, Sink, is gonna be

377
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:28,040
coming on the broadcast. We look forward to that for a lively discussion. And if we have

378
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:34,040
time while he's on, Melissa Melton, I told her, one of our reporters and researchers,

379
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:41,160
she actually in college, part of her degree is stats. So I said, listen, I just guesstimated

380
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:48,800
off these FBI numbers, 49% and 21% drop in overall violent crime and gun crime.

381
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:53,240
So I had her spend the last couple days breaking it down at FBI.gov. She's trying to export

382
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:58,000
the video right now for radio. Listeners will post on Infowars, where we can show you that

383
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:04,520
indeed my mental math was correct. Of course, I also saw them flash the numbers on Fox News

384
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,520
and went and double checked it.

385
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:14,160
They didn't even show the graphs. We're gonna show all those off FBI.gov. 49% drop, and

386
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:17,880
I was wrong. I misunderstood it when I saw it on Fox. When I looked at the numbers myself,

387
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:24,640
they just showed numbers. It's 49 in violent crime total in the last 20 years since 1991

388
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:28,000
because the numbers are always about a year behind.

389
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:35,320
Last numbers we have is 11, so they say since 1991. And then we have the other numbers.

390
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:41,040
It's even higher. Illegal acts with guns has gone on even more because America's swimming

391
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:45,000
in guns. Criminals have got their heads down. They go into immigrant areas where they know

392
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:50,240
people aren't armed. The Chinese triads go and feed on the Chinese immigrants they know

393
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:55,380
don't have a gun culture. The Mexican mafia goes and feeds on the poor Mexicans they know

394
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:58,760
most of them don't have guns.

395
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:01,840
Chicago, New York where the guns have been taken, the correct criminals go and feed on

396
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:07,440
you and your family. I mean criminals do not do home invasions. I was looking at the numbers.

397
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:13,280
It was over 100 times more common in Chicago than say in a small town in West Texas or

398
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:17,000
even a big city like Dallas. I mean, they don't home invade while you're there. They

399
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:22,480
make sure you're not there and then they still don't cuz I mean every day I read in the back

400
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,320
of the paper where people kill somebody in their house.

401
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:29,400
These criminals are so dumb the ones that are dumb enough in her house. They'll be like

402
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:33,120
stop I have a gun and they keep coming with a machete or whatever. And they're always

403
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:37,120
whacked out on drugs and they die. The criminals are on the run and that's why they're big

404
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:44,320
overlord criminals. The big daddy criminals like Chicago mob boss, the godfather as he's

405
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,880
called, Emanuel and Obama.

406
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:51,960
Their instinct is don't hurt our criminal brethren. And they want the fear, they want

407
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:55,560
to lock doors. They want you to have to call for more police which they then hire their

408
00:41:55,560 --> 00:42:00,300
own criminals to eat and then dominate you. They don't like the fact that most police

409
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:04,400
are awake now. They don't like the fact that most forces aren't corrupt in the country.

410
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,640
They want to convert us to a mafia system where they're above the law and safe and our

411
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:12,560
gun culture is winning and taking over. Even Clinton said this last week, I'm yet to play

412
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:15,960
the video, it was up at mfallwars.com.

413
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:20,460
So they understand this is a desperate gamble for them. They've gotta kill the gun culture

414
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:25,360
now because it's cancer to them, it's growing. This is a big surgery, they don't know they're

415
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:29,380
gonna make it. They're in their doctor, can we cut out the Constitution? Rangel said it's

416
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:32,440
our ultimate goal to get over the Constitution and Southerners.

417
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:38,460
I love how they try to say it's Southerners that want guns. Folks, it's people all over

418
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:45,440
this country want guns. I just saw a Tiananmen Square video from one of the hundreds of gun

419
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:50,440
rallies of people with guns at the capitals, loaded in many cases, exercising the right.

420
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:55,240
See, the system can't stand that. They wanna shame you and act like guns are already illegal.

421
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:57,960
So when the carpet cleaners at your house, they call the cops on you. That's what these

422
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:02,620
new laws they're proposing and new executive orders say is that if someone feels threatened

423
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:04,560
by a gun at your house, go ahead and call the cops.

424
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:08,800
They'll go ahead and take your guns, and then they'll make you go to a psychological evaluation.

425
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:13,280
And they say just wanting guns is a sign of mental illness or not trusting government.

426
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:17,160
Well, then America was founded on mental illness, and then we just got all the wealth and all

427
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:21,600
the power cuz we had the liberty. I guess mental illness, you know what, if that's crazy,

428
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:28,680
throw me in there, okay? You're right, you control free criminals, I absolutely hate

429
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:30,900
you and know who you are, and I want nothing to do with you.

430
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:38,000
And if you call that crazy, you bet I am. I'm as crazy as the day is long, you bet.

431
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:45,240
Now let's go to this piece. This is Nightline. And this was two and a half years ago they

432
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:57,380
came here. And you notice they don't even say, at least on the version I saw, yeah,

433
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:58,680
and point out this is two and a half years old.

434
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:02,560
It's like, we went and talked to Alex. And then they cut in the Piers Morgan appearance.

435
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:07,360
And at the end they say, he'll now be under a lot of scrutiny, implying it was evil for

436
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:14,520
me to say I have 50 guns. It was just a guesstimation, as if, my gosh, he's dangerous.

437
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:21,040
And then they show me throwing the football. And then they imply, he's not always this

438
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:28,000
crazy in person, it's all an act. Because there's a football in the back of the car

439
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
and we're getting in it.

440
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:33,040
They're like, you got a football, what's that? You relax. I go, well, yeah, of course I do.

441
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:38,080
I have children, it's my son's football. And I'm like, here, you wanna catch it? And they

442
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:41,420
cut it in going, when he didn't know the camera was rolling, he was playing football. That's

443
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:43,420
not true.

444
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:47,720
And then they say, he talked about many things with us not related to the New World Order.

445
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:51,740
Talked about their family, stuff like that, went to dinner with them. I've told that story.

446
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:59,820
But the point is, well, let's go ahead and start the piece. Here is Nightline implying

447
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:04,480
I take bits and pieces. Here's that clip.

448
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:10,280
We begin with America and its guns. As President Obama prepares to announce his sweeping plan

449
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:12,160
to curb gun violence tomorrow.

450
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:16,800
It paused, it paused. Back to the start, I've gotta just analyze the whole thing. I'm sorry,

451
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:21,600
it'll take a few segments. Talk about a woman who loves the sound of her voice.

452
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:29,360
America's guns, President Obama, President Obama. It's like some kind of weird confidence

453
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:34,000
game. These people are a joke, reading off her teleprompter. And then they cut to the

454
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,720
host of ABC Nightline as you came down here.

455
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:44,320
And again, listen to this. And then they say, hey, that CNN piece about one child policies,

456
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:49,880
that was tongue in cheeky, jokey. And you read the article, no, it wasn't. They just

457
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:53,800
held turning like, yeah, drones are killing people. It's real cool, yeah. Yeah, we're

458
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:58,880
setting up checkpoints on the highway to take blood, see, it's all done.

459
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:04,240
That's part of their psych warfare. Everything's fine, see. Let's go back to the clip. Here

460
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:05,240
it is.

461
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:10,400
We begin with America and its guns. As President Obama prepares to announce his sweeping plan

462
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:15,360
to curb gun violence tomorrow. Across the country, millions have already rushed out

463
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:21,720
to buy a record number of new guns. And one man who thinks that's a very good thing, radio

464
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:24,080
shock jock, Alex Jones.

465
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:28,440
He made national headlines last week with a fiery pro-gun tirade that quickly-

466
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:36,000
Backing up a few seconds, thank you. I'm a shock jock cuz, I mean, I think it's shocking

467
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,240
that Rangel says we've got to overcome the Constitution and that Southerners are just

468
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:41,080
bad people, period.

469
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:49,560
I mean, wow. Imagine if he said Northeasterners, they're trash. I mean, it's just, it's ridiculous.

470
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:53,960
And the Constitution is bad. I mean, Australian gun grabbers target bolt action rifles. They

471
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:58,400
always take the semi-autos first, then the handguns, then the pistols, then the bolt

472
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,760
actions, then the single shot.

473
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:03,600
They want all guns turned in. We knew that was coming, they do that everywhere. This

474
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:12,000
is how they do it. See, I find that shocking. I find it shocking that they pass the NDAA

475
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,160
to secretly arrest and kill and disappear US citizens. I find it shocking that mega

476
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:19,160
banks have been caught laundering hundreds of billions of dollars of drug money and don't

477
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:20,160
get in trouble.

478
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:24,920
But see, I'm a shock jock cuz I'm here going, wake up America, we're going into tyranny.

479
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:29,520
But they just want you to be easy and cool and go watch a sitcom, have a martini. Hey

480
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:33,160
man, everything's fine. I'm here to get you out of your coma. You see, that's why it was

481
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:34,160
so shocking.

482
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:37,000
They thought I was gonna come on and debate the First Amendment and should he be deported

483
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:41,240
and they wanted talking points and we're gonna stick to this, aren't we? And he had Alan

484
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:45,840
Dershowitz ready in the next segment. I went off the script, folks. It wasn't, they got

485
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:50,440
me on there cuz they knew I'd blow up.

486
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:55,240
They picked that up and broadcast that everywhere before they realized, wait a minute, this

487
00:47:55,240 --> 00:48:01,000
is actually waking people up, which it did, see. No weapon formed against us will prosper.

488
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:06,280
Let's go back to Nightline with a recycled, re-edited piece. Here it is.

489
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:12,000
Headlines last week with a fiery pro-gun tirade that quickly went viral. And that's not all

490
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,480
he's got to say. Here's ABC's Dan Harris.

491
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:21,160
Are you for Hitler or against Hitler? Whatever they say is the opposite. They never tell

492
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:22,160
me.

493
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,720
Let's just back it up to, I mean, what does that even mean? My point was you're either

494
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:29,200
for Stalin or against Stalin. You're either for Hitler or against Hitler. You're either

495
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:33,600
against this New World Order and all this ternary, or you're either for it or you're

496
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:34,600
against it.

497
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:40,560
It's very simple, but they just have a thing about Hitler. So people go, Hitler. I saw

498
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:50,360
a piece David Knight did. It was one of the crew about Martin Luther King, it was Mike

499
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:56,520
Adams. Martin Luther King and how he wouldn't support Obama. And I saw people commenting

500
00:48:56,520 --> 00:49:01,400
in there and they were serious. They go, are they bashing Martin Luther King in this piece?

501
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:07,120
Because at the end, Mike Adams says America doesn't want kings anymore. And we're talking

502
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:09,800
about King George III and we don't want King Obama.

503
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:14,040
And then people thought it was code against Martin Luther King. I mean, whoa, New World

504
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:20,680
Order is coming down on people at a million miles an hour and people are looking for codes.

505
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:23,360
But I'm gonna shut up though, cuz I wanna break here in a minute and a half. Let's start

506
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:25,280
with this clip. Here it is.

507
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:30,280
Are you for Hitler or against Hitler? Whatever they say is the opposite. They never tell

508
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:34,880
the truth. Tonight as millions of Americans worry about the government taking away their

509
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:39,680
guns, this man, Alex Jones, is pushing a lot of buttons.

510
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:45,120
And I'm here to tell you, 1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms. We

511
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:50,160
will not relinquish them. Do you understand? The republic will rise again when you attempt

512
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:51,160
to take our guns.

513
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:58,920
When Jones went on CNN's Piers Morgan Tonight, to discuss gun control in the wake of the

514
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:06,760
Sandy Hook massacre, he created a sensation. This video went massively viral.

515
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:11,080
And I wanna say this right here. You think you're a tough guy? Have me back with a boxing

516
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:12,200
ring in here.

517
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:14,400
But who is Alex Jones?

518
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:17,480
We've got ABC Nightly News slash Nightline here.

519
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:22,540
Despite his mistrust of the so-called mainstream media, Jones agreed to let us into his world

520
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:23,540
for a day.

521
00:50:23,540 --> 00:50:28,820
Hey, we're just soldiers looking across each other on the picket line here.

522
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:33,320
America has been captured. America is being robbed. We are now being looted like a third

523
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:37,520
world nation. Well, I'm not gonna sit down and shut up.

524
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:42,920
Jones is arguably the nation's premier purveyor of what could be called paranoia porn.

525
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:47,920
All right, applause. Yeah, we were paranoid porn pushers when we said they were gonna

526
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:52,800
come for your guns. We were paranoid porn pushers when we said that they would raise

527
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,040
taxes on poor people, which they've now done.

528
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:58,160
We were paranoid porn pushers when we said foreign countries would take their gold out

529
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,740
of the US. It's all happening, all happening.

530
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:04,480
If you've ever wanted one of our best selling generators, but we're waiting for an offer

531
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:09,440
so crazy you couldn't refuse, then you're not gonna wanna miss this exciting message.

532
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:14,920
Here's why. Our solar generators provide life-saving electrical power. And unlike gas generators,

533
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:20,360
solar generators run quietly, emit no fumes, and produce electricity from the sun. So when

534
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:23,480
the lights go out, you'll always have the power you need.

535
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:28,840
Now here's the best part. Every year we accumulate a few solar generators that we just can't

536
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:34,560
sell as new. We put them in a special spot in our warehouse, and we discount them heavily

537
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:39,120
at the end of each year. We call them scratch and dent units, but they're really just like

538
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:45,000
new. Each unit comes with a full factory warranty and special bonuses you just won't believe.

539
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:51,280
Don't wait, they go fast. Go to scratchanddentsolar.com, that's scratchanddentsolar.com. For the craziest

00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:16,600
the point is they're up there on the site. So I need to discuss that probably at another

573
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:22,640
point. Great way to wake people up is to have skateboards with infowars.com and the Alien

574
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:24,920
Workshop artwork on it.

575
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:28,760
Okay, let's get back to the night line and I gotta get into Benghazi after this guest

576
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:32,560
comes on. And we got the head of the Young Turks coming on the broadcast here today and

577
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:39,000
a lot of other important economic news. But first, let's go ahead and go back to the night

578
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,600
line piece. Here it is.

579
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:46,480
The truth strikes back. I'm live in 30 seconds. All right. Out of his studios near Austin,

580
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:51,520
Texas, his radio show and webcast reach an estimated 1 million people a day.

581
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:54,320
This federal intrusion is out of control.

582
00:55:54,320 --> 00:56:00,040
And on YouTube and elsewhere, Jones estimates 200 million people have seen his various documentaries.

583
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:01,040
No, that's one YouTube channel.

584
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:05,880
You're taking our destiny back. You're not our gods or our masters.

585
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:11,320
With titles like The Fall of the Republic, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement

586
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:13,200
and The Obama Deception.

587
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:15,520
Do you actually believe everything you say?

588
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:18,040
I believe all of it, absolutely. What I'm telling is the truth.

589
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:21,480
None of it is, you know, a shtick, a show at all?

590
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:23,040
No, it's all true.

591
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:25,080
You think Obama is a criminal?

592
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:27,960
Barack Obama is definitely an unconstitutional criminal.

593
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:33,600
Jones espouses a litany of conspiracy theories, although he thinks that term belittles his

594
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:34,600
reporting.

595
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:36,040
FEMA is running concentration camps?

596
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:37,040
Shutting them up.

597
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:41,560
They have designated sports stadiums. They have designated fields for the American people.

598
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:43,560
The manuals are public. I gave them to him.

599
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:45,200
The government's poisoning the water?

600
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:48,960
Absolutely. I have all these other government documents where the government...

601
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:49,960
Hit pause.

602
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:53,760
And again, I sat there and showed them the book, showed them the clothes, showed them

603
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:56,400
the plans, and they didn't want to look at it.

604
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:59,040
So they cut all that out when I'm giving proof.

605
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:00,040
Just this guy's crazy.

606
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:02,480
Next, they're going to say they injected black people with syphilis.

607
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:03,480
Oh, they did that.

608
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:06,680
Next, they're going to say that they and a bunch of kids just got paralyzed again from

609
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:08,760
the Bill Gates meningitis shots.

610
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:10,160
Oh, never mind.

611
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:13,680
Oh, next they'll say they radiated the troops and killed a bunch of them.

612
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:14,680
Oh, they did that.

613
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:17,760
Next, they'll say they sterilized a half million women without their consent.

614
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:18,760
Oh, they did that.

615
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:22,400
Next, they're going to say that the troops were exposed to sarin gas and it got covered

616
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,840
up in the Gulf War, and tens of thousands died.

617
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:25,840
Oh, that happened.

618
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:28,200
Let's go back to it.

619
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:29,200
Here it is.

620
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:33,200
Government think tanks propose poisoning the water to dumb down the population, make it

621
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:34,600
more easily manageable.

622
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:36,560
9-11 was an inside job?

623
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:38,800
Yes, 9-11 was an inside job.

624
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:42,920
It was a staged event to launch the Iraq war and to set up a domestic police state here

625
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:43,920
in the United States.

626
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:47,880
All I'm calling for is a real investigation, and the people of Oklahoma City have been

627
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:49,360
calling for an investigation.

628
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:54,640
Jones, who's 38, got his start with a local cable access show in the 1990s.

629
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:59,080
He now has a huge fan base, which at various times has included celebrities like Willie

630
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:01,600
Nelson, Jesse Ventura, Charlie Sheen.

631
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:03,320
We want our country back, Mr. President.

632
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:09,920
I'm calling on each and every American citizen to wake up, stand up, and demand the truth.

633
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:13,480
And reality stars Spencer Pratt and Heidi Montag.

634
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:15,480
Spencer Pratt, good to have you on with us today.

635
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:16,480
Thank you so much.

636
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:19,040
I'm so honored to be on with you.

637
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:21,040
You are a true legend, a true man.

638
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:22,040
All right.

639
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,040
That's enough.

640
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:24,040
The whole video's online.

641
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:30,200
It's called The Return of Alex Jones, but I mean, I didn't have time to get to it where

642
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:31,200
I'm throwing the football.

643
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:32,880
We'll have to play it later.

644
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:35,640
It's like, this is secret footage of him throwing a football.

645
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:38,720
I mean, it's just unbelievable hit piece.

646
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:51,080
This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.

647
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:55,800
You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms, but if you don't have a home security

648
00:58:55,800 --> 00:59:00,560
system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.

649
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:04,280
When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?

650
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:06,000
Check out Simply Safe.

651
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:10,440
It's a new do-it-yourself home security system that is completely wireless.

652

00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:15,880

654
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:20,280
It runs on battery power, so even if the grid goes down, you are protected.

655
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:25,080
It's completely customizable, so you can use it in your home, business, boat, trailer,

656
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:27,000
storage unit, or shed.

657
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,440
GetSimplySafe.com.

658

659
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:36,620
need to let a stranger into your home.

660
00:59:36,620 --> 00:59:40,720
If you move or need to relocate, you can take the system with you wherever you go.

663
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:53,640
Again, that's GetSimplySafe.com.

664
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:55,860
Waging war on corruption.

665
00:59:55,860 --> 01:00:05,360
Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.

666
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:10,200
Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.

667
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:11,200
You want answers?

668
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:13,360
Well, so does he.

669
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:17,560
He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.

670
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:26,200
And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.

671
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:28,800
Earlier in the last hour, I said our guest has saved 35,000.

672
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:29,800
That was an old number.

673
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:31,800
It's 45,000 Chinese girls.

674
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:36,480
They estimate there's something like 20-something million more men in China.

675
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:41,640
Last time I saw, it may even be higher than there are women, because they're killing the

676
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:42,640
young women.

677
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:44,840
Supposed to be about 51% women.

678
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:49,120
Women live a little bit longer, so that goes into the actuary, but also, there's slightly

679
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:50,120
more.

680
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:56,080
If you do international studies, baby girls born than baby boys.

681
01:00:56,080 --> 01:01:00,080
Kind of something God designed in there, so there's more women out there.

682
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:04,520
So we can have a leg up as a mammalian species, but that's a side issue.

683
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:05,520
Again, Alex Jones here.

684
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:09,560
Thanks for joining us, Dr. James Garrow, PhD.

685
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:13,480
Well-known, I've heard of him many times, Canadian teacher and businessman who founded

686
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:18,840
a big institute in China back in the 60s, discovered how they were killing the children

687
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:21,360
with the one-child policy, which is now on record.

688
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:22,920
In fact, his work helped expose that.

689
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:27,280
He's coming up in the next segment, because he was told by a retired high-level military

690
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:30,820
officer that the litmus test is, will you fire on US citizens?

691
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:36,480
And I just thought, I probably should have done more research, not more research, more.

692
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:38,080
That's not the work, cuz I've done the research.

693
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:43,400
I should have done more polling data and sources to show you here, because I can show you all

694
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:46,840
the army manuals where they're training for gun confiscation.

695
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:49,280
I can show you all of that where they're training to shoot Americans.

696
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:51,800
I mean, that's on the news now.

697
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:55,200
So you understand, it's not just him talking to this source we're gonna try to find out

698
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:56,600
about.

699
01:01:56,600 --> 01:02:00,240
It's that it's already hiding in plain view.

700
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:04,600
And the 1.6 billion bullets and the end deposit commentatas and the troops on the streets

701
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:06,920
and all the rest of it, that's coming up in the next segment.

702
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:09,520
He'll be with us for about 35, 40 minutes.

703
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:12,640
And then I will get into Benghazi, cuz that's very important.

704
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:14,080
And I wanna break down what's really behind that.

705
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:18,360
I mentioned some of it last hour, but it's key that's coming up.

706
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:23,000
And then I'm seeing articles like this every two or three days, well, actually every day,

707
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,000
really.

708
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,160
Cuz every couple days I'll see two or three at one time, so I guess it's about every day.

709
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:31,000
There's probably seven of these stories a week I'd have to guesstimate.

710
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:35,600
Elementary school girl threatened with arrest over paper gun.

711
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:39,040
And you hear about people saying, career day, right about your dad or mom.

712
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:42,120
Well, my dad's in the Marines, here's a picture of him with his M-16.

713
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:46,400
Boom, you're arrested, take it in for psychiatric questioning as a 10-year-old.

714
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:52,720
Doesn't matter, you're the star quarterback or whatever, I've never been in trouble.

715
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:57,040
It's just crazy, or you bring a Dixie plastic knife to spread butter, your mother drops

716
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:58,040
in the lunchbox.

717
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:01,960
My mother did that, boom, you're arrested.

718
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:05,160
But government stomps around in Darth Vader outfits all day.

719
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:08,940
Elementary school girl threatened with arrest over paper gun hysteria and aftermath of Sandy

720
01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:10,800
Hook reaches new heights.

721
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:13,560
That's an Infowars.com article out of Philadelphia Elementary.

722
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:18,640
Now, of course, in Philadelphia, came out five years ago, they've got laptops they give

723
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:21,200
you, watching you at home.

724
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:24,560
And they're the ones that announced that, they're very proud of it.

725
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:28,000
We play the clubs for the teachers doing interviews, that's how it broke going, yeah, we watch

726
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,920
you when you're at home, what you're doing, look out.

727
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:34,280
Like there's Santa Claus or Demon Claus or something.

728
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:39,680
This is the total demonization of a boy's playing with an orange and green Nerf gun

729
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:42,560
in his front yard with kids, SWAT team is called.

730
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:47,200
The anti-gunners are so anti-gun, they say they don't believe boys should be able to

731
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:48,840
play with guns.

732
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:53,160
You hear about kids getting in trouble for making bang bang, using their fingers as a

733
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:54,160
gun.

734
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:57,960
But the so-called leftists who are really authoritarians, they want checkpoints, they

735
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:02,640
want a billion six bullets, they want armored vehicles, they want TSA hands on the pants.

736
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:09,200
They wanna bomb Benghazi and bomb Syria, they wanna do all this, they love force.

737
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:15,680
Some Belgrade, go after the Serbs, but that cuz it's loving when they do it, they love

738
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:16,680
force.

739
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:20,920
I mean, you know these people when they see an orange gun and kids running around the

740
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:23,640
front yard, you see everywhere.

741
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:27,720
You know that they know that's not a real gun when they see a six year old doing it

742
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:28,720
and they call the police.

743
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:35,880
It's like neighbors in Oklahoma saw the upstanding middle class families, three year old pee

744
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:38,120
up against a tree in the front yard.

745
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:42,000
They came and they gave them a ticket and threatened them with arrest and stuff, and

746
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,560
they fired that cop and they should have.

747
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:49,280
I mean everybody knows that three year olds pee in the yard, but again it's this idea

748
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:52,400
of get us all in the system, get us in trouble.

749
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:55,720
I mean, fucks, I'll be honest with you, I pee in my backyard, I mean who doesn't?

750
01:04:55,720 --> 01:05:00,880
Of course this was in the front yard, I don't know.

751
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:05,720
Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves how did we ever survive from natural disasters

752
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:10,320
like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on

753
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:12,160
by a disastrous economy.

754
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:14,880
Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything.

755
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:18,680
At e Foods Direct, we hear from customers every day that are fortunate enough to weather

756
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:21,600
life's storm by having a supply of food on hand.

757
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:26,140
After Hurricane Sandy, Danny from New York City wrote, almost all the grocery stores

758
01:05:26,140 --> 01:05:30,960
are closed, but I managed to get my e Foods just in time to be able to help my sister

759
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:31,960
and niece.

760
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:35,760
It is better to be prepared 10 years too early than one day too late.

761
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:38,000
I can warn you, but I can't feed you.

Supernatural Silver is safe enough to consume every day, while powerful enough to destroy

775
01:06:25,980 --> 01:06:31,080
the causes of many serious diseases such as stress, staph, pneumonia, colds, flus, and

776
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:32,640
other harmful pathogens.

777
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:37,520
This new technology has the ability to terminate entire colonies of harmful bacteria at several

778
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:41,660
hundred times the effectiveness of colloidal or ionic silver solutions.

779
01:06:41,660 --> 01:06:45,320
The Science Digest Journal says silver is our mightiest germ fighter.

780
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:49,180
It is virtually non-toxic and is emerging as a wonder of modern medicine.

01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:11,360
You want answers?

797
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:13,520
Well, so does he.

798
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:17,720
He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.

799
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:22,800
And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.

800
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:37,720
All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are into the second hour of worldwide broadcast.

801
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:44,120
The main host of the Young Turks, Sink, is going to be joining us in the next hour.

802
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,800
Coming up in about 30, 40 minutes.

803
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:50,360
I'm going to break down the latest on what really happened in Benghazi and the aftermath

804
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:55,320
of Hillary Clinton's ridiculous testimony and Rand Paul saying that if he was Obama,

805
01:08:55,320 --> 01:08:59,000
she should have been relieved of her office, of her position.

806
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,120
I mean, they're all in on it.

807
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:04,360
They ordered a stand down in Benghazi to cover up what was really happening there.

808
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:05,600
Eight hours.

809
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:10,680
Their own Al-Qaeda security they hired to run Benghazi are the ones that killed them.

810
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:12,000
I mean, this is incredible.

811
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,800
And none of the senators will bring that up.

812
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:19,600
I mean, it's hiding in plain view, but their whole narrative falls apart.

813
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:23,520
And they can't take our rights anymore if they point out that elements of the government,

814
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:27,620
criminal elements, are running Al-Qaeda.

815
01:09:27,620 --> 01:09:28,620
Not the whole government.

816
01:09:28,620 --> 01:09:30,800
See, they go, you're a 9-11 truther.

817
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:32,640
You're not saying there's not any Muslim extremists.

818
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:34,080
That's not what I'm saying.

819
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:38,180
I'm saying our government uses them to take down countries and uses them to then menace

820
01:09:38,180 --> 01:09:39,640
America and take our liberties.

821
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:42,000
That's coming up.

822
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:46,360
Now Dr. James Garrow, PhD, is a Canadian teacher and businessman.

823
01:09:46,360 --> 01:09:51,960
And in 1968, he founded the Bethune Institute, legendary language school, the People's Republic

824
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:57,200
of China, named after the Canadian surgeon, Dr. Norman Bethune.

825
01:09:57,200 --> 01:09:59,240
I think I'm pronouncing that right.

826
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:04,920
One day in 2000, Dr. Jim Garrow, executive director of the institute's popular Pink Pagoda

827
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:08,960
schools in China, found his assistant weeping.

828
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:13,280
The woman told him how her sister's husband was insisting that the couple's newborn daughter

829
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:17,720
be smothered to make way for a son under China's one-child policy.

830
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:19,600
And this has now all been confirmed.

831
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:21,200
Years ago, they would deny it.

832
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:25,800
Garrow's promised to help and was able to place the infant with an adoptive couple.

833
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:31,040
That's why you see so many Chinese girls in America now, mainly adopted by evil white

834
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:36,340
people, of course, because all whites are evil, according to people like, I've got a

835
01:10:36,340 --> 01:10:44,280
bizarre Daily Beast article here, we're gonna get to later, where they, well, just wait

836
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:45,280
till I cover it.

837
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:52,960
It's absolutely, absolutely astounding when you see it, admitting that they're getting

838
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:54,800
rid of America and getting rid of our sovereignty.

839
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:55,800
It's incredible.

840
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:57,920
I've got to cover that today.

841
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:04,800
But Dr. James Garrow joins us because if you're up at Infowars.com, you can see this article,

842
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:07,840
also punch it up for people watching on television.

843
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:14,040
Nobel Peace Prize nominee Obama asked military leaders if they will fire on US citizens.

844
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:17,600
Shock claim purported to come from one of America's foremost military leaders.

845
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:22,800
Well, we've already got General Boykin, former head of Special Forces, saying our government,

846
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:25,120
he believes, was giving weapons to Al-Qaeda.

847
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:26,720
And that's what Benghazi is, is a cover-up.

848
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:29,020
He believes, it's admitted.

849
01:11:29,020 --> 01:11:31,400
That's what's so incredible here.

850
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:32,400
We don't know if it's Boykin.

851
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:33,400
I'm gonna try to find out here.

852
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:36,480
The point is, if you go to our article, and there was other articles that actually broke

853
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:39,760
it in the Examiner and a couple others the day before.

854
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:41,200
And I'm giving them credit.

855
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:48,520
Our articles, they'll back it up with the Army training manuals from 2010 FM 3-39.40

856
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:49,520
internment resettlement.

857
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:52,400
It also has gun confiscation, how to take over cities.

858
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:54,400
You can click on that and read that.

859
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:58,780
The clergy response teams, the backup that, hey, this guy's credible.

860
01:11:58,780 --> 01:11:59,780
That's why we got him on.

861
01:11:59,780 --> 01:12:00,860
And I believe he's telling the truth.

862
01:12:00,860 --> 01:12:08,000
But I've talked to Colonel Roberts, whose nephew graduated from West Point, was in these

863
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:12,080
Army meetings telling him, 10 years ago, we're training to confiscate guns.

864
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:14,120
I've been to the urban warfare drills.

865
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:18,240
I mean, there's hundreds of data points.

866
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:21,800
The Army National Guard trained in Iowa and Arcadia to confiscate guns.

867
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:22,840
That was in the news.

868
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:23,840
You know about this.

869
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:25,940
You saw Katrina.

870
01:12:25,940 --> 01:12:29,980
But the litmus test is, will you fire on US citizens?

871
01:12:29,980 --> 01:12:32,320
And they tried it in Katrina.

872
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:33,840
They're doing the drills everywhere.

873
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:36,360
But now they've bought the 1.6 billion bullets.

874
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:40,660
Now they're hiring people out of the military to move them into Homeland Security as a militarized

875
01:12:40,660 --> 01:12:41,840
domestic force.

876
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:46,440
New York Times, scouts trained to fight terrorists and more three and a half years ago.

877
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:50,520
Those 14-year-old explorer scouts are now 17 and a half, training to, quote, take on

878
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:53,280
disgruntled vets that wouldn't turn their guns in.

879
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:58,240
First paragraph of the New York Times, with dozens of color photos showing the simulated

880
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:04,200
killing with paintball guns of veterans in America.

881
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:09,320
I've talked to ROTC people on air and confirmed, they don't train to fight Al-Qaeda, they train

882
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:10,960
to fight US militias.

883
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:14,920
They've got four TV shows coming out this year, demonizing American gun owners and how

884
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:16,600
we're gonna be the new terror force.

885
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:19,840
Homeland Security is now converting over to the American people.

886
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:21,600
Now I'm gonna shut up and go to our guest.

887
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:24,080
I wanted to back that up for people.

888
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:28,960
So you can go to our article, Nobel Peace Prize nominee, Obama asked military leaders,

889
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:31,520
they will fire on US citizens.

890
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:37,240
Now we're gonna find out from the man himself who talked to this individual, Dr. James Garrow,

891
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:38,240
PhD.

892
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:42,040
Number one, I would say this military officer, he says the foremost out there, needs to go

893
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:46,740
public or they may die in a kayak accident like the former CIA director who exposed Waco

894
01:13:46,740 --> 01:13:50,640
and leaked the Fleer footage because he was upset about it.

895
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:54,520
A, he better go or she better go public with this right now.

896
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:58,160
And I think it's better for you to do that because the system knows when a general or

897
01:13:58,160 --> 01:14:01,680
even a Pat Tillman, someone well known comes out, that's the danger.

898
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:04,940
If I'm up here showing army manuals, they know the average person isn't gonna go look

899
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:06,720
those up and find that I'm telling the truth.

900
01:14:06,720 --> 01:14:09,940
So I'm gonna go to you, Dr. James Garrow, PhD.

901
01:14:09,940 --> 01:14:15,720
Tell us how the story unfolds, what you were told, then I wanna get into saving Chinese

902
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:18,820
girls before they get smothered or used for medical experiments.

903
01:14:18,820 --> 01:14:19,820
Thank you for joining us.

904
01:14:19,820 --> 01:14:20,820
Well, thanks, Alex.

905
01:14:20,820 --> 01:14:21,820
I hope you can hear me fine.

906
01:14:21,820 --> 01:14:22,820
Yes, sir.

907
01:14:22,820 --> 01:14:25,360
We got your video Skype and got you on phone.

908
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:30,660
Tell us a little bit about yourself, for those that don't know, and then get into what this

909
01:14:30,660 --> 01:14:33,040
military officer told you, this individual.

910
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:34,560
Well, okay.

911
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:37,680
And first of all, I'm an educator, but a businessman.

912
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:40,800
I operate schools in China.

913
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:46,220
And in the past, I've been a college president and the teacher's college principal here in

914
01:14:46,220 --> 01:14:47,220
Canada.

915
01:14:47,220 --> 01:14:51,800
My background is education, but I also am involved in business, of course, in the country

916
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:52,800
of China.

917
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:58,760
I probably have the largest network of schools, foreign language schools, in China.

918
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:00,560
And the elites send their kids to our schools.

919
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:05,760
So we know a lot about what's going on directly from the Chinese elite, the leaders.

920
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:11,520
Hu Jintao's niece was in one of my schools, and the current leader, Xi Lingping, his daughter

921
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:16,480
was in one of my schools, and of course, is now in Harvard, but that's beside the point.

922
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:20,200
So that gives you a little bit of background on me.

923
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:28,040
And I should have added, you've gotten 45,000 plus, and we actually, David Knight has adopted

924
01:15:28,040 --> 01:15:31,720
children from China who would have been disposed of girls.

925
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:36,200
So he vouches for you as well, and I mean, I know who you are, but he says you're certainly

926
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:37,200
the bona fide.

927
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:42,000
So thank you for that information, saving 45,000 girls at the UN and the eugenicists

928
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,240
say are worth nothing, because they're such big feminists.

929
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:51,360
Now let's get into this officer, what they told you, and elaborate on this information.

930
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:52,360
Shall do.

931
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:59,440
I got a call the day before yesterday in the morning from this officer, a former officer,

932
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:04,760
he's retired, but he was quite upset that one of the people he'd encouraged to join

933
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:10,360
the military was being squeezed out, that he was forced to resign his commission.

934
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:13,840
And it was because a question was asked of him.

935
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:18,280
Now I've called it a litmus test, but basically what it is, he was asked if in a scenario,

936
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:25,760
if in a situation where the military was called upon to go and confront people who were armed,

937
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:30,640
American citizens who would not relinquish their arms, in spite of the second amendment

938
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:36,400
right to hold arms, would you fire on American citizens?

939
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:42,080
This gentleman related to me that the officer was totally flummoxed that he would be asked

940
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:48,880
this question, and he said his answer was no, I would not fire on American citizens.

941
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:52,600
And he was forced to resign his commission immediately.

942
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:54,640
Amazing.

943
01:16:54,640 --> 01:17:00,520
Tell us more about, I mean, to quote you here from the article, you basically described

944
01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:07,880
him as one of America's most foremost military heroes.

945
01:17:07,880 --> 01:17:09,600
Can you give us an idea about this person?

946
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:11,200
Is this person going to go public?

947
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:13,440
Can you tell us what else he relayed to you?

948
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:20,640
Well, we had an hour long conversation, so it ran the gamut from talking about the transparency

949
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:26,640
or lack of, the manipulation of the mindset of the public as a result of a media that

950
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:35,440
no longer actually reports news, but now spouts the Obamaism, there was that part of the conversation.

951
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:40,540
His concern though was that the military was going to be put in an awful position where

952
01:17:40,540 --> 01:17:46,240
they had to look at the oath they had taken, look at the officers who were also required

953
01:17:46,240 --> 01:17:51,300
to give an oath to obey the orders given by those above them, including the commander

954
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:53,880
in chief, which would make it Obama.

955
01:17:53,880 --> 01:18:00,300
And if those orders were in fact to kill American civilians because they would not give up something

956
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:05,960
they had a constitutional right to in the second amendment, namely their guns, he was

957
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:13,320
afraid that so many would be leaving the military that it would leave a vacuum actually in fact

958
01:18:13,320 --> 01:18:20,920
for people who would really be swearing allegiance to a new king, a new dictator, Obama.

959
01:18:20,920 --> 01:18:22,560
And that was his concern.

960
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:27,120
This man is a legend, yes, you would know his name, every American would know his name,

961
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:31,400
and no, he will not be coming public, he'll not be bringing it out in public.

962
01:18:31,400 --> 01:18:35,280
He thought that the best thing he could do is put it out in a different way.

963
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:39,400
I was honored that he called me.

964
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:43,480
So it's not somebody like Boykin?

965
01:18:43,480 --> 01:18:49,600
I can't give you the name, he's asked me not to, so in honoring that request, I won't

966
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:50,600
answer that.

967
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:53,920
I know several generals and he'd be at the top of the list, and by knowing them, I know

968
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:56,920
people that have worked with them, made films with some of these generals, and there's only

969
01:18:56,920 --> 01:19:01,840
a list of four or five that I know that would probably start talking about something like

970
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:02,840
this.

971
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:06,160
I know they're training for it, I have the video, I have the training manuals, it's really

972
01:19:06,160 --> 01:19:07,160
not a secret.

973
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:10,720
And I've had military call in who said, we've been asked, are we gonna fire on citizens,

974
01:19:10,720 --> 01:19:13,680
and then we're shipped overseas if we won't, or kicked out.

975
01:19:13,680 --> 01:19:19,440
And they're forming, and then basically sheep dipping, making them quasi-CIA, Homeland Security,

976
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:22,720
domestic, kind of NKVD units.

977
01:19:22,720 --> 01:19:28,320
And I got news for the establishment, you'll be able to kill Alex Jones, take out Ron Paul

978
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:29,680
in the first wave.

979
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:34,720
But once you kill the Canaries, I would not wanna be anybody in a government uniform at

980
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:35,720
that point.

981
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:37,560
And that's part of the plan too, a civil war.

982
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:41,560
I wanna talk about your hour long conversation with this person, and where the military's

983
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:43,640
trying to kill us and take our guns.

984
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:50,600
I mean, obviously, Obama's controllers, the foreign globalist, they know this is designed

985
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:53,040
to destroy the military and police, which is what you said.

986
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:57,560
It gets rid of them, because you're still gonna have bad officers commanding them, and

987
01:19:57,560 --> 01:20:01,000
then brings in the new forces.

988
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:04,720
If you've ever wanted one of our best selling generators, but we're waiting for an offer

989
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:09,680
so crazy you couldn't refuse, then you're not gonna wanna miss this exciting message.

990
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:10,680
Here's why.

991
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:13,760
Our solar generators provide life saving electrical power.

992
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:19,400
And unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no fumes, and produce electricity

993
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:20,400
from the sun.

994
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:23,840
So when the lights go out, you'll always have the power you need.

995
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:25,460
Now here's the best part.

996
01:20:25,460 --> 01:20:30,140
Every year we accumulate a few solar generators that we just can't sell as new.

997
01:20:30,140 --> 01:20:35,320
We put them in a special spot in our warehouse, and we discount them heavily at the end of

998
01:20:35,320 --> 01:20:36,320
each year.

999
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:40,040
We call them scratch and dent units, but they're really just like new.

1000
01:20:40,040 --> 01:20:45,240
Each unit comes with a full factory warranty and special bonuses you just won't believe.

1001
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:46,800

counterfeit then carting to a private bank, having it lead back at interest, forcing taxes

1033
01:22:38,540 --> 01:22:39,540
to service debt.

1034
01:22:39,540 --> 01:22:43,060
This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public

1035
01:22:43,060 --> 01:22:46,440
currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?

girls that would have been smothered, ground, or medical experiments.

1053
01:24:16,680 --> 01:24:20,480
Now they just come and pick them up, the state picks them up, and they just disappear off

1054
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:25,640
into a labyrinth of hell, just like the Falun Gong being blood-typed and harvested for the

1055
01:24:25,640 --> 01:24:26,640
elites for their organs.

1056
01:24:26,640 --> 01:24:31,040
We're going to get into that in the next segment with our guest, Hunter James Garrow, PhD,

1057
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:35,400
very highly respected individual.

1058
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:39,120
My guess, if I have to say who it is, is that it'd be somebody like General, Lieutenant

1059
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:43,400
General William Boykin, who's also exposing right now that our government's giving weapons

1060
01:24:43,400 --> 01:24:44,400
to Al-Qaeda.

1061
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:48,000
And that's in the news today, that's coming up after our guest leaves us, and by the way,

1062
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:53,120
that's in the film, Behold a Pale Horse, America's Last Chance, starring country music legend

1063
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:55,600
Charlie Daniels, and Boykin is in that film.

1064
01:24:55,600 --> 01:25:00,560
That's why I'm guessing it'd be somebody like Boykin, because you can disagree with some

1065
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:05,380
of his views in the past, but he is overall a patriot who's anti-New World order and pro-sovereignty

1066
01:25:05,380 --> 01:25:07,640
and that's about the only kind of guy I'd see exposing that.

1067
01:25:07,640 --> 01:25:13,520
Somebody like Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, who was in government, exposes this type of stuff.

1068
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:19,080
Another Roberts, Lieutenant Colonel Roberts out of Oklahoma, he's exposed things like

1069
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:20,440
this, but it's all out there.

1070
01:25:20,440 --> 01:25:25,960
We're going to get into China coming up in the next segment, but what else, Dr. Garrow,

1071
01:25:25,960 --> 01:25:33,560
can you relay to us in this hour-long conversation, and why did this senior household name for

1072
01:25:33,560 --> 01:25:39,640
anybody that knows military, one of America's foremost military heroes, to quote you, why

1073
01:25:39,640 --> 01:25:45,720
would they come to you, I mean, I know he knows you, and tell you this information,

1074
01:25:45,720 --> 01:25:51,200
and then say, get it out there, but I can't say, and then relay other things that he told

1075
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:52,200
you?

1076
01:25:52,200 --> 01:25:58,560
Well, I would suggest that he's talking in fear, that he knows that the Obama administration

1077
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:03,720
has a circle of death around them in terms of, I use that term because that has been

1078
01:26:03,720 --> 01:26:11,280
said to me, because there are people who have met with an unfortunate fate, who have dared

1079
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:18,880
to cross Obama, but this gentleman came to me, I've known him for about 17 years, and

1080
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:24,440
he came to me as a result of the fact that he had read the book that I had just written

1081
01:26:24,440 --> 01:26:32,440
about my work, Saving Baby Girls in China, and he had called me about three months ago

1082
01:26:32,440 --> 01:26:36,960
saying, hey, I bought a copy of your book, it's wonderful, da-da-da-da, and that made

1083
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:42,400
the connection, so the other day when he called me, he was just saying, Jim, look, I know

1084
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:45,600
you're connected with all sorts of people, you're on the net, you know how to do all

1085
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:48,400
these things, would you put this out for me?

1086
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:53,360
And I said that it would be an honour for me to do that.

1087
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:58,760
Well obviously, he's risking his life putting this out, because the info's out there, and

1088
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:02,520
a lot of these older generals, and it came to you because he doesn't understand the internet

1089
01:27:02,520 --> 01:27:07,480
completely, and how it works, they still, I mean obviously he knows the NSA's gonna

1090
01:27:07,480 --> 01:27:14,340
track this back, they're gonna know the relationship, Obama knows, and I mean, I guess he thinks

1091
01:27:14,340 --> 01:27:18,460
that if he just puts it out there in intermediary, they won't go after him, the danger is now

1092
01:27:18,460 --> 01:27:22,120
not going public full bore, that's when they come after you.

1093
01:27:22,120 --> 01:27:30,880
But if they kill this foremost military hero, living hero, then everybody will know.

1094
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:34,420
So I mean, in a way, I guess it's good that he did talk to you, but what else did he say

1095
01:27:34,420 --> 01:27:38,480
about this other person he got to join the military years ago, now being asked if they'd

1096
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:43,680
fire on US citizens, I mean, what else did he tell you about the plan to come after us?

1097
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:49,360
Well that's basically it, he was reflecting back to me what was being said to him, about

1098
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:54,080
this poor fella who he'd encouraged to get involved in the military, and the man who'd

1099
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:59,120
gone up the ranks, suddenly this litmus test was being put in front of him, and it was

1100
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:02,960
either, you know, you're gonna agree or you're not, you're gonna get squeezed out.

1101
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:11,600
So his concern was that good, loyal Americans who had decided to give their lives to the

1102
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:15,400
country in the service of the country, were being put in such an awful position.

1103
01:28:15,400 --> 01:28:20,360
I mean, this is the kind of thing that you would expect to have, a test of loyalty as

1104
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:27,440
it were, for people who were involved in Mao's regime, or down in Chavez's regime, or somewhere

1105
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:31,360
else, like the Nazis, this is the kind of thing they would have done, this isn't what

1106
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:36,760
happens in a democracy, this isn't what happens with people in the services, serving the nation,

1107
01:28:36,760 --> 01:28:39,760
putting their lives on the line, this is just not what happens.

1108
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:45,880
So the shock here is the knowledge that this isn't just one person it's happening to, this

1109
01:28:45,880 --> 01:28:51,040
person came forward, this person is somebody of integrity, but my goodness, it's not just

1110
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:56,920
this one gentleman, it's others, and women who were put in this position of, and are

1111
01:28:56,920 --> 01:29:00,880
now being asked the question, would you in fact do this?

1112
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:04,880
And that was the shock for this well-known American hero.

1113
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:09,720
We're gonna go to break, come back in a long segment and get into what's happening in China,

1114
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:14,720
and the authoritarianism over there, and what you've dealt with, with the killing of these

1115
01:29:14,720 --> 01:29:16,740
little girls that you've been saving.

1116
01:29:16,740 --> 01:29:20,240
But the countless millions you haven't been able to save, unfortunately.

1117
01:29:20,240 --> 01:29:24,120
But I'm gonna briefly, when we come back, break down for people, and then get your take

1118
01:29:24,120 --> 01:29:25,880
on this.

1119
01:29:25,880 --> 01:29:29,840
That the military, and I've noticed even senior brass, they're experts in their area, but

1120
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:31,040
not in full spectrum.

1121
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:35,760
I know what the globalists are planning, cuz I watch their propaganda, and they prepare

1122
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:37,960
the ground first before they do it.

1123
01:29:37,960 --> 01:29:40,800
They have billed Obama as Lincoln.

1124
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:45,760
And now they're, and I said this four years ago, now they're saying that he's gonna have

1125
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:50,240
a civil war and be our god, be our king, that they've got this set up.

1126
01:29:50,240 --> 01:29:53,920
We're on the march, the empire's on the run.

1127
01:29:53,920 --> 01:30:01,160

leave the silver at the surface, but rather we have formulated our silver gel using the

1150

natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the

1155
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:05,600
Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive from natural disasters

1156
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:10,200
like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on

1157
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:12,040
by a disastrous economy?

1158
01:32:12,040 --> 01:32:14,760
Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything.

At eFoods Direct, we hear from customers every day that are fortunate enough to weather life's

1160
01:32:18,920 --> 01:32:21,480
storm by having a supply of food on hand.

1161
01:32:21,480 --> 01:32:26,020
After Hurricane Sandy, Danny from New York City wrote, almost all of the grocery stores

1162
01:32:26,020 --> 01:32:30,840
are closed, but I managed to get my eFoods just in time to be able to help my sister

1163
01:32:30,840 --> 01:32:31,840
and niece.

1164
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:35,640
It is better to be prepared 10 years too early than one day too late.

1165
01:32:35,640 --> 01:32:37,880

From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.

1172
01:33:11,080 --> 01:33:20,240
I'm going to get into what we're facing here in just a moment.

1173
01:33:20,240 --> 01:33:24,320
And I tell you, I know about some of the few generals that have actually been anti New

1174
01:33:24,320 --> 01:33:25,960
World Order to some extent.

1175
01:33:25,960 --> 01:33:29,520
I know about a few of the generals that have met with people that I know who've been woken

1176
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:32,800
up now, mainly retired generals.

1177
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:36,880
I know about generals and admirals that have been shot and killed in the chest and in the

1178
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:41,160
head multiple times and it's ruled suicides the last few years.

1179
01:33:41,160 --> 01:33:46,040
All the generals you've seen having to resign, having to step down or resign their commissions,

1180
01:33:46,040 --> 01:33:47,800
admirals, heads of CENTCOM.

1181
01:33:47,800 --> 01:33:51,380
The truth is our military keeps saying no, no, no, no, no.

1182
01:33:51,380 --> 01:33:56,840
Even handpicked guys from West Point in the military 30 years who've got whole careers

1183
01:33:56,840 --> 01:33:59,280
and everything ahead of them the last few years.

1184
01:33:59,280 --> 01:34:00,280
They are resigning.

1185
01:34:00,280 --> 01:34:02,800
We're going to talk about that in a moment.

1186
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:08,440
Briefly, we are a listener supported radio, filmmaking, news organization and when you

1187
01:34:08,440 --> 01:34:14,520
buy books and videos and materials at Infowarsstore.com, you get the very lowest prices on things like

1188
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:19,760
propure stainless steel water filters with promo code, water you get 10% off.

1189
01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:22,080
And you support the transmission.

1190
01:34:22,080 --> 01:34:23,500
Wars are not cheap.

1191
01:34:23,500 --> 01:34:25,620
Wars take money and this is an infowar.

1192
01:34:25,620 --> 01:34:30,040
We know the truth will set us free and that all the evil men in tires need to flourish

1193
01:34:30,040 --> 01:34:32,120
is that good men and women do nothing.

1194
01:34:32,120 --> 01:34:37,860
So again, we have the new t-shirt, come and take it.

1195
01:34:37,860 --> 01:34:43,080
And inside the AK-47 it says, the right to keep mere arms shall not be infringed.

1196
01:34:43,080 --> 01:34:49,620
And we also have behold a pale horse that has General Boykin in it, a patriot exposing

1197
01:34:49,620 --> 01:34:54,120
agenda 21 and the entire New World Order system.

1198
01:34:54,120 --> 01:34:59,720
So be sure and get all of that at Infowarsstore.com and spread the word about the broadcast.

1199
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:04,360
I'm up here risking my life to get the word out because I realize how evil the globalists

1200
01:35:04,360 --> 01:35:05,360
are.

1201
01:35:05,360 --> 01:35:06,800
I realize there's no future if we don't beat them.

1202
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:12,340
They plan and now shifting gears back to our guest, Dr. Jim Garrow, the big plan is this

1203
01:35:12,340 --> 01:35:13,720
and I've studied history.

1204
01:35:13,720 --> 01:35:16,060
I've studied the Rand Corporation's writings.

1205
01:35:16,060 --> 01:35:21,100
I've studied the writings of the leftist finance by the big banks that want to collectivist

1206
01:35:21,100 --> 01:35:25,900
system for the grassroots where the globalists are exempt from all the laws offshore.

1207
01:35:25,900 --> 01:35:30,920
So they can then take our tax money as corporate welfare offshore, invest our pension funds

1208
01:35:30,920 --> 01:35:35,840
in their fraudulent derivative scams to hold the entire financial system hostage.

1209
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:36,920
That's it in a nutshell.

1210
01:35:36,920 --> 01:35:44,720
It's a corporate fashions system, a crony anti-free market capitalist monopoly system

1211
01:35:44,720 --> 01:35:51,480
sitting on top of a lower tier socialism communism, social engineering program.

1212
01:35:51,480 --> 01:35:56,200
And I started seeing this five years ago and I'm on record in Obama deception four years

1213
01:35:56,200 --> 01:35:57,200
ago.

1214
01:35:57,200 --> 01:36:01,200
I'm on record in Fall of the Republic three and a half years ago, two films about Obama

1215
01:36:01,200 --> 01:36:04,040
saying they're building him up as a messianic Christ.

1216
01:36:04,040 --> 01:36:05,540
They keep saying he's Lincoln.

1217
01:36:05,540 --> 01:36:06,540
He's Lincoln.

1218
01:36:06,540 --> 01:36:07,540
He's somebody like Lincoln.

1219
01:36:07,540 --> 01:36:08,540
You'll see.

1220
01:36:08,540 --> 01:36:12,760
And I said, they're doing that to later if they decide to bring in martial law, say he's

1221
01:36:12,760 --> 01:36:14,720
Lincoln who will crush the states.

1222
01:36:14,720 --> 01:36:18,560
Then he creates the 10 region governors to say, I don't need 50 states.

1223
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:20,040
I've got 10 appointed governors.

1224
01:36:20,040 --> 01:36:24,840
He creates the rural council over communities all over the country and I get our guest take

1225
01:36:24,840 --> 01:36:26,560
on this.

1226
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:30,360
And says Homeland Security and the Pentagon is over that and then we get the training

1227
01:36:30,360 --> 01:36:31,360
manuals for it.

1228
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:33,360
It's gun confiscation, okay?

1229
01:36:33,360 --> 01:36:37,460
So this is totally, absolutely creepy.

1230
01:36:37,460 --> 01:36:41,420
And I've done reports on this, we're gonna do another this week cuz it's Paramount.

1231
01:36:41,420 --> 01:36:45,400
They're saying he's Lincoln, let the states, and I even have an article here today.

1232
01:36:45,400 --> 01:36:47,000
Let the states not turn their guns in.

1233
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,280
Let the legislature say no.

1234
01:36:49,280 --> 01:36:51,840
He's Lincoln and will crush a new civil war.

1235
01:36:51,840 --> 01:36:54,200
Well, we're not gonna start a war.

1236
01:36:54,200 --> 01:36:58,560
They're gonna go out and try to take the guns, provocateur stuff, a new Waco if they have

1237
01:36:58,560 --> 01:36:59,560
to.

1238
01:36:59,560 --> 01:37:02,980
And they're going to try to elicit a 1776.

1239
01:37:02,980 --> 01:37:05,520
So that's why I got it out in the open on Piers Morgan.

1240
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:08,720
And said it will trigger a new 1776.

1241
01:37:08,720 --> 01:37:14,360
Not to cause one, but to point out to everybody out there in TV land, hey, this isn't gonna

1242
01:37:14,360 --> 01:37:15,360
be fun.

1243
01:37:15,360 --> 01:37:17,560
Now, I'm gonna shut up and go to our guest.

1244
01:37:17,560 --> 01:37:21,240
As we went to break and I said that, he was nodding his head going, absolutely, that's

1245
01:37:21,240 --> 01:37:22,240
what he said.

1246
01:37:22,240 --> 01:37:27,040
So what did the general, cuz we know who you're talking about, I know who goes in these Christian

1247
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:28,040
circles.

1248
01:37:28,040 --> 01:37:29,040
I went and did some searching.

1249
01:37:29,040 --> 01:37:33,840
I think I know who the foremost military hero is.

1250
01:37:33,840 --> 01:37:38,880
But again, I think he's made a mistake only going through you as 17 year friend.

1251
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:42,640
The system, if I can figure this out in about five minutes, the system knows without even

1252
01:37:42,640 --> 01:37:44,840
using phone tracking systems.

1253
01:37:44,840 --> 01:37:48,620
So tell the general, he's not stupid that he needs to go completely public.

1254
01:37:48,620 --> 01:37:53,560
But going back to you here, sir, what is your take on what I just said of the master plan?

1255
01:37:53,560 --> 01:37:59,480
They plan to start a war using guns to then label all conservatives and libertarians the

1256
01:37:59,480 --> 01:38:03,960
enemy, which is in all the Homeland Security training manuals that we got from state police

1257
01:38:03,960 --> 01:38:04,960
and federal marshals.

1258
01:38:04,960 --> 01:38:05,960
Go ahead.

1259
01:38:05,960 --> 01:38:10,760
You know, Alex, the only time I've ever seen you, and I'm not a watcher of programs like

1260
01:38:10,760 --> 01:38:11,760
yours.

1261
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:15,160
But the only time I've seen you was when I went and did a little bit of research and

1262
01:38:15,160 --> 01:38:20,000
I ran across this thing where you took on this British guy, Piers Morgan.

1263
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:21,500
You just mentioned him.

1264
01:38:21,500 --> 01:38:24,560
And I thought, you know, you just fried the guy.

1265
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:25,560
You just fried him.

1266
01:38:25,560 --> 01:38:29,400
But you put it out there with such intensity that thought, you know, maybe I'm going to

1267
01:38:29,400 --> 01:38:30,400
get fried today.

1268
01:38:30,400 --> 01:38:31,400
I don't know.

1269
01:38:31,400 --> 01:38:32,400
But you know what?

1270
01:38:32,400 --> 01:38:33,400
You're hot, man.

1271
01:38:33,400 --> 01:38:34,400
You're on the money.

1272
01:38:34,400 --> 01:38:39,120
When you talk about them setting it up to take away the guns and they're looking for

1273
01:38:39,120 --> 01:38:40,120
the crisis.

1274
01:38:40,120 --> 01:38:41,120
Come on.

1275
01:38:41,120 --> 01:38:45,240
That's what Valerie Jarrett has been pushing Obama to create a crisis.

1276
01:38:45,240 --> 01:38:50,080
And your military friends, they all are aware of what's going on.

1277
01:38:50,080 --> 01:38:56,160
The nightmare for them, the nightmare scenario is having to turn their guns on American civilians

1278
01:38:56,160 --> 01:39:01,200
because the new emperor, or at least the guy who thinks he's the new potentate, thinks

1279
01:39:01,200 --> 01:39:07,140
that he can just go out there, crush the Second Amendment, crush the Constitution, and then

1280
01:39:07,140 --> 01:39:09,520
crush anyone who gets in his way.

1281
01:39:09,520 --> 01:39:11,720
What's been the pattern, Alex, so far?

1282
01:39:11,720 --> 01:39:16,100
When people get in his way, what happens to them?

1283
01:39:16,100 --> 01:39:18,700
And that's because the globalists are taking over everywhere.

1284
01:39:18,700 --> 01:39:19,700
He's their puppet.

1285
01:39:19,700 --> 01:39:24,160
I saw a video of the Speaker of the House at a dinner groveling to Michelle Obama and

1286
01:39:24,160 --> 01:39:26,640
her rolling her eyes and batting him away.

1287
01:39:26,640 --> 01:39:33,280
It is pathetic how Congress, sycophantically through fear, is lining up to serve Obama.

1288
01:39:33,280 --> 01:39:35,320
What did your military source say?

1289
01:39:35,320 --> 01:39:38,960
Because when I walked out after the break, you were saying, that's dead on.

1290
01:39:38,960 --> 01:39:40,160
That's what it is.

1291
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:43,320
Was the military source saying they want a civil war?

1292
01:39:43,320 --> 01:39:46,480
Or were you agreeing with my analysis because we have all these top Democrats saying, we

1293
01:39:46,480 --> 01:39:48,560
need a big crisis to make you king?

1294
01:39:48,560 --> 01:39:54,040
Alex, it was my military contact who said it is so obvious to him, so obvious to the

1295
01:39:54,040 --> 01:40:00,360
man that was resigning, that what they were setting up was a takeover, a total takeover,

1296
01:40:00,360 --> 01:40:04,680
by Obama, and using the military to have it happen.

1297
01:40:04,680 --> 01:40:09,600
And if the military will not, if they'll not give the right answer to this litmus test,

1298
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:13,880
they've got a whole army of young kids who don't know any better, ready to move in.

1299
01:40:13,880 --> 01:40:18,920
And keep in mind, who are the people who get away with in the despotic times?

1300
01:40:18,920 --> 01:40:21,480
Who are the ones that they rely on in the end?

1301
01:40:21,480 --> 01:40:25,320
It's the young kids who don't know any better, but who can point a gun and kill people.

1302
01:40:25,320 --> 01:40:26,320
Wait a minute.

1303
01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:29,320
So your military source knows about the FEMA Corps.

1304
01:40:29,320 --> 01:40:33,120
Now, this isn't secret, but it's not well known to the public.

1305
01:40:33,120 --> 01:40:39,040
Describe what he told you about that, about the Uighan squads from about 17 down to 14.

1306
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:41,200
Well, his words exactly were.

1307
01:40:41,200 --> 01:40:46,640
Here's the Hitler Youth being resurrected now under this name of Obama Corps.

1308
01:40:46,640 --> 01:40:47,960
That's exactly what he said.

1309
01:40:47,960 --> 01:40:50,040
Mike, this is devastating.

1310
01:40:50,040 --> 01:40:52,040
This is devastating.

1311
01:40:52,040 --> 01:40:54,920
Because I've gone and looked this up before I got you on, and I know the big Christian

1312
01:40:54,920 --> 01:40:55,920
circles you're in.

1313
01:40:55,920 --> 01:41:00,560
99% I know, and I've talked to you off air, and you're just like, nope, I'm not talking.

1314
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:02,240
But I know who this is.

1315
01:41:02,240 --> 01:41:05,560
And I know other military officers, colonels and others that are saying the same thing.

1316
01:41:05,560 --> 01:41:09,080
I've got family that told me years ago I was right about everything, but now won't even

1317
01:41:09,080 --> 01:41:11,320
talk to me who's in the army.

1318
01:41:11,320 --> 01:41:15,480
I mean, this is because they've been passed over promotion just because they're related

1319
01:41:15,480 --> 01:41:16,480
to me.

1320
01:41:16,480 --> 01:41:20,000
And I mean, this is amazing that this is going on.

1321
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:21,760
I mean- Are you armed?

1322
01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:22,760
Are you armed?

1323
01:41:22,760 --> 01:41:23,760
Do you have armament?

1324
01:41:23,760 --> 01:41:24,760
Yes, I do.

1325
01:41:24,760 --> 01:41:25,760
Do you have guns?

1326
01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:26,760
Yes, I do.

1327
01:41:26,760 --> 01:41:27,760
Well, you need them.

1328
01:41:27,760 --> 01:41:32,160
And you know, the vice president of my company in the US is a guy named Eric Rush, who happens

1329
01:41:32,160 --> 01:41:35,400
to be a black guy who's a journalist in your country.

1330
01:41:35,400 --> 01:41:38,040
Well, you know what I did for him yesterday?

1331
01:41:38,040 --> 01:41:44,520
I purchased him an AR-15 and a sidearm because I am so worried about the things that are

1332
01:41:44,520 --> 01:41:45,640
being said right now.

1333
01:41:45,640 --> 01:41:51,760
He's out there putting it out through WorldNetDaily, I think's the name, putting the word out,

1334
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:57,400
letting people know the dangers of what, are you ready for this, what China is demanding

1335
01:41:57,400 --> 01:41:58,400
of Obama.

1336
01:41:58,400 --> 01:41:59,400
No, no, no.

1337
01:41:59,400 --> 01:42:03,080
China, China, we broke it a month ago, the Drudge Report, DrudgeReport.com linked to

1338
01:42:03,080 --> 01:42:04,080
it.

1339
01:42:04,080 --> 01:42:05,080
They're People's Daily.

1340
01:42:05,080 --> 01:42:06,640
I know you're in China and been there, you know it.

1341
01:42:06,640 --> 01:42:10,640
Their TV said, you will, quote, have a war against your gun owners.

1342
01:42:10,640 --> 01:42:11,640
We're ready to back you.

1343
01:42:11,640 --> 01:42:13,040
They're the biggest owner of the debt.

1344
01:42:13,040 --> 01:42:18,060
And then I've got a Daily Beast article where they said, it's good that Piers Morgan is

1345
01:42:18,060 --> 01:42:19,480
leading the anti-gun deal.

1346
01:42:19,480 --> 01:42:22,800
We need to get Americans used to foreigners running things.

1347
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:25,000
I mean, this is insane.

1348
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,680
Break down what's happening in China.

1349
01:42:27,680 --> 01:42:31,760
What's happening in China is they know, well, first of all, do you know that the Chinese

1350
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:34,520
call Obama the monkey man?

1351
01:42:34,520 --> 01:42:35,720
Do you know that?

1352
01:42:35,720 --> 01:42:37,460
I've seen that in the news, yes.

1353
01:42:37,460 --> 01:42:39,160
It has nothing to do with him being black.

1354
01:42:39,160 --> 01:42:42,440
It has everything to do with the way they treat monkeys.

1355
01:42:42,440 --> 01:42:44,800
Monkeys are like puppets in China.

1356
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:48,480
So Obama is looked upon as a puppet of China.

1357
01:42:48,480 --> 01:42:49,920
That's how he's looked upon.

1358
01:42:49,920 --> 01:42:55,480
And they know full well that when he comes hat in hand begging for more dollars, they're

1359
01:42:55,480 --> 01:42:56,480
going to make more demand.

1360
01:42:56,480 --> 01:43:01,160
Were you the one who broke the news about the fact that in Idaho, they've set up this

1361
01:43:01,160 --> 01:43:06,480
thing very much like Shenzhen, China, a special economic zone?

1362
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:08,480
Was that you, Alex?

1363
01:43:08,480 --> 01:43:13,360
Yes, we're one of the ones, and now Jerome Corsi has confirmed that all over the US,

1364
01:43:13,360 --> 01:43:17,240
I actually visited some of these in my first film, they're setting up these economic zones

1365
01:43:17,240 --> 01:43:21,960
where the government lets the Chinese government be tax free, but then citizens aren't.

1366
01:43:21,960 --> 01:43:23,880
That's the model in the future.

1367
01:43:23,880 --> 01:43:27,280
Globalist will be tax free, but we will be under Agenda 21.

1368
01:43:27,280 --> 01:43:30,440
Well, you know, I've talked to Joseph Farah about that.

1369
01:43:30,440 --> 01:43:33,720
I've talked to Jerome Corsi about that very thing.

1370
01:43:33,720 --> 01:43:40,400
You know, Jerry Corsi, he endorsed my book, and my book came out through Joseph Farah.

1371
01:43:40,400 --> 01:43:44,740
But I'm telling you, the information that's available to some people about what's going

1372
01:43:44,740 --> 01:43:52,760
on in China and how they're treating the American land and the American resources,

1373
01:43:52,760 --> 01:43:58,800
they're treating it as something which they will be able to grab sometime soon.

1374
01:43:58,800 --> 01:44:05,160
And so the fact that they now have five special economic zones throughout the United States,

1375
01:44:05,160 --> 01:44:06,760
you've got to be aware of what's happening.

1376
01:44:06,760 --> 01:44:13,680
The fact that discussions have taken place with Obama and some of his officials in China

1377
01:44:13,680 --> 01:44:14,680
to talk about...

1378
01:44:14,680 --> 01:44:19,600
The NAFTA superhighway is their invasion route from the Pacific side of Mexico right into

1379
01:44:19,600 --> 01:44:21,320
the US, and they're going to be brought in.

1380
01:44:21,320 --> 01:44:26,040
I've talked to top officers, let's see, in the Washington Post, agreements to bring in

1381
01:44:26,040 --> 01:44:31,160
under NLE 09, troops from 15 nations to quell domestic unrest.

1382
01:44:31,160 --> 01:44:33,640
That's at FEMA.gov.

1383
01:44:33,640 --> 01:44:36,160
And guess who was on the list of the 15 nations?

1384
01:44:36,160 --> 01:44:37,160
Who?

1385
01:44:37,160 --> 01:44:39,000
Wouldn't be China, would it?

1386
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:40,000
Oh, yeah.

1387
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:41,080
That's what I'm telling listeners.

1388
01:44:41,080 --> 01:44:42,200
It's all...

1389
01:44:42,200 --> 01:44:44,240
And people say that'll never happen.

1390
01:44:44,240 --> 01:44:46,040
Once they start a civil war, it will.

1391
01:44:46,040 --> 01:44:47,480
Yeah, it's already happening.

1392
01:44:47,480 --> 01:44:49,480
They're setting it up for civil war.

1393
01:44:49,480 --> 01:44:53,980
They're setting it up to take away the freedom of the American people.

1394
01:44:53,980 --> 01:44:56,200
And Obama, he doesn't believe in freedom.

1395
01:44:56,200 --> 01:45:00,360
He doesn't believe you should ever have a gun.

1396
01:45:00,360 --> 01:45:01,840
What else is your military source?

1397
01:45:01,840 --> 01:45:06,720
Because, again, if you're a new listener, folks, China officially said, quote, have

1398
01:45:06,720 --> 01:45:11,280
a war against your gun owners, we will back you, in their biggest TV state run and the

1399
01:45:11,280 --> 01:45:12,280
People's Daily.

1400
01:45:12,280 --> 01:45:16,880
I mean, they're openly saying this and saying, we own your debt, you take their guns.

1401
01:45:16,880 --> 01:45:21,640
I mean, and then I've got a Daily Beast article saying it's good that foreigners are telling

1402
01:45:21,640 --> 01:45:22,640
us what to do.

1403
01:45:22,640 --> 01:45:24,520
I'm going to dig it up here, I'm trying to find it.

1404
01:45:24,520 --> 01:45:26,800
No, and you're absolutely correct, Alex.

1405
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:28,240
It's exactly what's going on.

1406
01:45:28,240 --> 01:45:33,640
The Chinese are demanding that Obama take control of the guns because as they move in

1407
01:45:33,640 --> 01:45:39,800
and steal the resources of America, buy them, buy them out in satisfaction of the debt,

1408
01:45:39,800 --> 01:45:42,480
which Obama knows full well he cannot pay.

1409
01:45:42,480 --> 01:45:45,400
When you know you're not going to be able to pay your credit card, why don't you run

1410
01:45:45,400 --> 01:45:50,840
it up as far as you can, as long as they're saying yes, get as much goodies as you possibly

1411
01:45:50,840 --> 01:45:51,840
can.

1412
01:45:51,840 --> 01:45:52,840
That's the mindset of Obama.

1413
01:45:52,840 --> 01:45:57,000
Well, he knows full well he will never have to actually pay the debt.

1414
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:01,300
All he has to do is say, hey, we've already shut down the oil industry.

1415
01:46:01,300 --> 01:46:03,960
They're not drilling, we'll give you permission to drill.

1416
01:46:03,960 --> 01:46:06,720
We've already destroyed the coal industry in America.

1417
01:46:06,720 --> 01:46:10,840
So come take the coal, you can use it, it's a better coal than you have in China.

1418
01:46:10,840 --> 01:46:14,240
They need it, they need the resources of America.

1419
01:46:14,240 --> 01:46:17,140
And that's what they are demanding from Obama.

1420
01:46:17,140 --> 01:46:19,500
And let's be clear about this.

1421
01:46:19,500 --> 01:46:23,160
China has been maneuvered to be the biggest owner of our debt by the Federal Reserve who

1422
01:46:23,160 --> 01:46:27,200
set this up when they could have just monetized and paid the debt that way.

1423
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:32,280
Instead, they had the Chinese communists come in who kill millions of their dissidents on

1424
01:46:32,280 --> 01:46:34,480
record because they're the model of globalism.

1425
01:46:34,480 --> 01:46:39,400
We're told by the CFR, China is the model, not the Chinese people, the authoritarianism.

1426
01:46:39,400 --> 01:46:45,560
They use the slave wages, the Apple factories with the suicide nets, so no one can compete

1427
01:46:45,560 --> 01:46:49,860
in the West to consolidate power in globalist hands.

1428
01:46:49,860 --> 01:46:53,760
And then the Chinese People's Daily and their biggest TV station, we did a news article

1429
01:46:53,760 --> 01:46:55,000
linked to it.

1430
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:59,480
Paul Watson was aware of it because his wife is Chinese and she first alerted it.

1431
01:46:59,480 --> 01:47:02,600
Paul went and found the actual English version of it.

1432
01:47:02,600 --> 01:47:05,560
And they say, I've read this on air, listeners can go pull it up.

1433
01:47:05,560 --> 01:47:11,600
In fact, guys, the headline's something like Chinese state-run media tells Obama to take

1434
01:47:11,600 --> 01:47:12,600
the guns.

1435
01:47:12,600 --> 01:47:14,040
Pull up the info words for me, guys, good job.

1436
01:47:14,040 --> 01:47:16,720
I wanna show viewers, radio listeners, pull it up.

1437
01:47:16,720 --> 01:47:22,960
And they say, quote, wage war against the gun owners, do whatever it takes, it's key.

1438
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:26,760
We've given you money, and again, they're gonna be given the national parks, the land

1439
01:47:26,760 --> 01:47:28,520
is collateral, that's all official.

1440
01:47:28,520 --> 01:47:33,640
The Chinese communists were being conquered and they're saying, hey, we own your people

1441
01:47:33,640 --> 01:47:36,180
now, you take their guns.

1442
01:47:36,180 --> 01:47:40,400
And now the UN treaties coming up, this is the master plan, it's so evil.

1443
01:47:40,400 --> 01:47:44,560
Yeah, you know, it's funny, but I was told, when I checked with my friends, I said, have

1444
01:47:44,560 --> 01:47:46,780
you ever heard of this guy, Alex Jones?

1445
01:47:46,780 --> 01:47:50,240
And one of my American friends said, well, you know, he's a bit of a conspiracy theory

1446
01:47:50,240 --> 01:47:51,240
nut.

1447
01:47:51,240 --> 01:47:55,180
And, you know, now I've come on, I've listened to what you've had to say, and I'm sitting

1448
01:47:55,180 --> 01:47:58,520
here going, wow, this guy's not a nut?

1449
01:47:58,520 --> 01:47:59,520
You have the information.

1450
01:47:59,520 --> 01:48:03,520
I don't know where you're getting this, but I'm telling you, you are right on the money.

1451
01:48:03,520 --> 01:48:08,660
And keep in mind something, Yamamoto was right when he said, you don't wanna invade America

1452
01:48:08,660 --> 01:48:11,680
because behind every blade of grass, there'll be a gun.

1453
01:48:11,680 --> 01:48:16,280
And you know, the Chinese know full well, that's exactly the situation with America

1454
01:48:16,280 --> 01:48:17,280
right now.

1455
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:19,720
Obama knows, he's got his marching orders.

1456
01:48:19,720 --> 01:48:25,020
He's been told to take your guns, he's been told to have your people crushed so that the

1457
01:48:25,020 --> 01:48:27,360
Chinese can do what they want.

1458
01:48:27,360 --> 01:48:28,360
You're right.

1459
01:48:28,360 --> 01:48:33,600
And we did find that People's Daily, one of the articles where it says innocent blood

1460
01:48:33,600 --> 01:48:37,520
demands gun control, and then it talks about waging war against American gun owners.

1461
01:48:37,520 --> 01:48:41,640
So here's the article, peers pressure, believe it or not, Morgan is a great spokesman for

1462
01:48:41,640 --> 01:48:42,640
gun control.

1463
01:48:42,640 --> 01:48:49,120
And the article goes on to say, he is globalization 2.0, you know, teaching us to basically go

1464
01:48:49,120 --> 01:48:53,680
under global government, and it will only survive if we submit to this.

1465
01:48:53,680 --> 01:48:57,080
I mean, this is amazing what they've done to us.

1466
01:48:57,080 --> 01:48:58,360
Oh, absolutely.

1467
01:48:58,360 --> 01:49:01,000
You've been manipulated every which way but loose.

1468
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:06,320
They know full well that the, here's the other thing, the United Nations and the World Bank

1469
01:49:06,320 --> 01:49:13,000
in collusion with Obama, suppose he turns around and says to them or to the world community,

1470
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,080
you know what, we cannot meet the debt.

1471
01:49:15,080 --> 01:49:16,240
Could you help us out here?

1472
01:49:16,240 --> 01:49:25,000
Could you help us broker a fair solution and pay off the debt in some way possible in whatever

1473
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:26,000
way possible?

1474
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:31,040
And the United Nations and the World Bank will be glad to say yes, we'll come in.

1475
01:49:31,040 --> 01:49:33,280
In fact, let's just do this.

1476
01:49:33,280 --> 01:49:34,400
Let's look at Idaho.

1477
01:49:34,400 --> 01:49:35,400
Look what you've got out there.

1478
01:49:35,400 --> 01:49:36,400
You got all this open space.

1479
01:49:36,400 --> 01:49:38,280
Let's look at Kansas.

1480
01:49:38,280 --> 01:49:39,720
We need the breadbasket.

1481
01:49:39,720 --> 01:49:41,960
We need to be able to grow great.

1482
01:49:41,960 --> 01:49:45,240
And that's why they've got to have Obama as the head of the UN Security Council violating

1483
01:49:45,240 --> 01:49:47,360
Article 1 Section 9 Clause 8.

1484
01:49:47,360 --> 01:49:52,800
That's why they admit in this Daily Beast article by Peter Beinart, who really shows

1485
01:49:52,800 --> 01:49:55,680
he's a globalist, they've got to get us used to this.

1486
01:49:55,680 --> 01:49:58,640
They've got to get us ready to go under world government.

1487
01:49:58,640 --> 01:50:03,240
It's so incredibly sick that they've maneuvered us to this point.

1488
01:50:03,240 --> 01:50:05,000
And by the way, they found it in the People's Daily.

1489
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:06,360
Punch it back up for me, guys.

1490
01:50:06,360 --> 01:50:11,400
They found where it said Obama needs to engage in a protracted war.

1491
01:50:11,400 --> 01:50:12,400
You guys just had it.

1492
01:50:12,400 --> 01:50:15,020
You had it right on the spot with the war part.

1493
01:50:15,020 --> 01:50:16,480
That's what I wanted to read on air.

1494
01:50:16,480 --> 01:50:17,480
TV viewers saw it.

1495
01:50:17,480 --> 01:50:18,480
There it is.

1496
01:50:18,480 --> 01:50:19,480
Action speaks louder than words.

1497
01:50:19,480 --> 01:50:23,680
If Obama wants to take practical measures to control guns, he has to make preparation

1498
01:50:23,680 --> 01:50:28,000
for a protracted war and considerable political cost.

1499
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,840
Then they go on to say the Chinese government's ready to help.

1500
01:50:30,840 --> 01:50:31,840
What do you make of that?

1501
01:50:31,840 --> 01:50:33,480
I mean, that is just in our face.

1502
01:50:33,480 --> 01:50:38,720
Yeah, well, keep in mind, yeah, it's an incremental thing.

1503
01:50:38,720 --> 01:50:40,040
And that's what this guy is.

1504
01:50:40,040 --> 01:50:41,040
Obama's all about incrementalism.

1505
01:50:41,040 --> 01:50:43,960
What's he done to the American public?

1506
01:50:43,960 --> 01:50:48,960
If you ever would you ever countenance for one minute, any man putting their hands on

1507
01:50:48,960 --> 01:50:49,960
your wife?

1508
01:50:49,960 --> 01:50:53,600
Would you ever wouldn't you detect the person who do that?

1509
01:50:53,600 --> 01:50:54,960
But now you do TSA.

1510
01:50:54,960 --> 01:50:58,840
Every time you go into the airport, every time stay there, we're gonna come back, we're

1511
01:50:58,840 --> 01:50:59,840
gonna come back.

1512
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:01,160
You know what's going on.

1513
01:51:01,160 --> 01:51:05,160
Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive?

1514
01:51:05,160 --> 01:51:09,200
From natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the

1515
01:51:09,200 --> 01:51:12,600
family hardships brought on by a disastrous economy.

1516
01:51:12,600 --> 01:51:15,300
Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything.

1517
01:51:15,300 --> 01:51:19,480
At eFoods Direct, we hear from customers every day that are fortunate enough to weather life's

1518
01:51:19,480 --> 01:51:22,020
storm by having a supply of food on hand.

1519
01:51:22,020 --> 01:51:26,560
After Hurricane Sandy, Danny from New York City wrote, almost all the grocery stores

1520
01:51:26,560 --> 01:51:31,360
are closed, but I managed to get my eFoods just in time to be able to help my sister

1521
01:51:31,360 --> 01:51:32,360
and niece.

1522
01:51:32,360 --> 01:51:36,160
It is better to be prepared 10 years too early than one day too late.

1523
01:51:36,160 --> 01:51:38,400
I can warn you, but I can't feed you.

1524
01:51:38,400 --> 01:51:40,760

1529
01:52:00,720 --> 01:52:04,440
Hey there, Frank Bates here.

1530
01:52:04,440 --> 01:52:09,520
Have you heard about the weird device that could wipe out 280 million Americans?

1531
01:52:09,520 --> 01:52:11,560
This is really scary stuff.

1532
01:52:11,560 --> 01:52:16,520
Defense experts warn that this odd device poses the gravest threat we've ever known.

1533
01:52:16,520 --> 01:52:20,820
In fact, just a few weeks ago, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich wrote an op-ed

1534
01:52:20,820 --> 01:52:24,480
piece for the Washington Post warning about this deadly threat.

1535
01:52:24,480 --> 01:52:27,360
I can't believe that more people aren't talking about this.

1536
01:52:27,360 --> 01:52:31,240
It may be because the liberals and the government are trying to cover it up.

1537
01:52:31,240 --> 01:52:36,920
That's why my friend just created a free video at WeirdDevice.com that exposes this threat

1538
01:52:36,920 --> 01:52:39,720
and blows the doors off the conspiracy.

1539
01:52:39,720 --> 01:52:45,560
Go watch the shocking video at WeirdDevice.com right now to discover exactly what it is plus

1540
01:52:45,560 --> 01:52:50,000
discover the number one way you and your family can survive this deadly attack.

1541
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:55,080
I'm not sure how long this video will be online, so go to WeirdDevice.com before it's gone

1542
01:52:55,080 --> 01:52:56,080
forever.

1543
01:52:56,080 --> 01:53:00,360
Again, that's WeirdDevice.com.

1544
01:53:00,360 --> 01:53:01,360
Food storage?

1545
01:53:01,360 --> 01:53:02,360
Check.

1546
01:53:02,360 --> 01:53:03,360
Survival tools?

1547
01:53:03,360 --> 01:53:04,360
Check.

1548
01:53:04,360 --> 01:53:05,360
Weapons and water filters?

1549
01:53:05,360 --> 01:53:06,360
Check.

1550
01:53:06,360 --> 01:53:09,520
But what about a permanent source of cooking power that can run forever without buying

1551
01:53:09,520 --> 01:53:11,320
fuel or paying for maintenance?

1552
01:53:11,320 --> 01:53:15,700

Cook hot meals with just a handful of sticks.

1562
01:54:00,120 --> 01:54:05,200
Well, this is the end of our interview.

1563
01:54:05,200 --> 01:54:10,560
You're in about six minutes with Jim Garrow, but I want to get him back on for a full hour

1564
01:54:10,560 --> 01:54:13,000
next week or as soon as he can.

1565
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:22,600
He saved over 45,000 young newborn baby Chinese girls that would have been killed.

1566
01:54:22,600 --> 01:54:24,820
And he joins us right now.

1567
01:54:24,820 --> 01:54:27,080
Here's the Daily Beast, okay?

1568
01:54:27,080 --> 01:54:33,640
And there are literally dozens of similar articles by Peter Beinart, how you pronounce

1569
01:54:33,640 --> 01:54:38,280
it, and this is, of course, Newsweek's biggest publication online.

1570
01:54:38,280 --> 01:54:42,800
And they say, we got to get Americans used to globalism, you got to go read it.

1571
01:54:42,800 --> 01:54:47,320
And that we're preparing everybody and that America's power is in decline, globalization

1572
01:54:47,320 --> 01:54:51,320
means that other nations will influence and judge us, and we must basically do what they

1573
01:54:51,320 --> 01:54:52,320
say.

1574
01:54:52,320 --> 01:54:59,320
And they go on to say, Chinese officials are lecturing us, and that's good, that's a quote.

1575
01:54:59,320 --> 01:55:04,200
Mexican billionaires are lecturing us, that's good, you got to go read this.

1576
01:55:04,200 --> 01:55:07,960
And then it goes on to say Al Jazeera's purchased current TV, that's good, it's good for us

1577
01:55:07,960 --> 01:55:09,760
to go under foreign control.

1578
01:55:09,760 --> 01:55:15,360
And then he says somewhere, Alex Jones is readying his flamethrower, let him.

1579
01:55:15,360 --> 01:55:20,160
Because in the next round of the culture war, we will likely not just pit black and brown

1580
01:55:20,160 --> 01:55:21,160
versus white.

1581
01:55:21,160 --> 01:55:25,520
That's why they get on the news and say, gun owning is racist, we're gonna get the whites.

1582
01:55:25,520 --> 01:55:29,740
That's why Rangel's saying, whites are the enemy, southerners are the enemy, gun owners

1583
01:55:29,740 --> 01:55:30,740
are the enemy.

1584
01:55:30,740 --> 01:55:33,280
And you're like, that's really crazy.

1585
01:55:33,280 --> 01:55:39,080
Political correctness teaches everybody to be nice, but then again, this is all a plan.

1586
01:55:39,080 --> 01:55:41,040
It's secular versus religious.

1587
01:55:41,040 --> 01:55:47,720
It will pit those Americans who can't accept the increased, let's just go to our guest.

1588
01:55:47,720 --> 01:55:51,720
It says Alex is readying his flamethrower, let him, they basically just say they're gonna

1589
01:55:51,720 --> 01:55:53,000
smash us.

1590
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:57,000
I'm seeing this everywhere, and I've seen this in the Weatherman FBI trials where some

1591
01:55:57,000 --> 01:56:02,480
of them admitted to being in these meetings, where they said, we're gonna kill the libertarians

1592
01:56:02,480 --> 01:56:03,480
and conservatives.

1593
01:56:03,480 --> 01:56:06,160
They said, we're gonna put them in reeducation camps, we're gonna bring the Chinese in to

1594
01:56:06,160 --> 01:56:07,160
do this.

1595
01:56:07,160 --> 01:56:09,200
I mean, this is insanity.

1596
01:56:09,200 --> 01:56:13,280
But they're really, it looks like going to try it with the Civil War as the cover kicked

1597
01:56:13,280 --> 01:56:14,320
off by taking the guns.

1598
01:56:14,320 --> 01:56:18,600
I just read that where they say, Alex showed us our enemy, don't worry, we're gonna get

1599
01:56:18,600 --> 01:56:19,600
him.

1600
01:56:19,600 --> 01:56:21,760
I mean, Piers Morgan has said he wants to shoot me.

1601
01:56:21,760 --> 01:56:22,760
What do you make of these people?

1602
01:56:22,760 --> 01:56:29,320
Well, the founding fathers knew exactly what was going to come down the pipe if ever people

1603
01:56:29,320 --> 01:56:34,960
lost sight of why the Constitution was built the way it was, why the Republic was framed

1604
01:56:34,960 --> 01:56:36,400
the way it was.

1605
01:56:36,400 --> 01:56:42,240
And what you're doing, you are actually, again, I'm back to this thing of where is this nut

1606
01:56:42,240 --> 01:56:44,640
case, Alex Jones, coming from?

1607
01:56:44,640 --> 01:56:45,640
Well, you're not.

1608
01:56:45,640 --> 01:56:47,200
You're on the money.

1609
01:56:47,200 --> 01:56:52,480
And you are providing the protection that the Fifth Estate, that the people in the media

1610
01:56:52,480 --> 01:56:56,920
should be providing the people of the United States by exposing the very things that you're

1611
01:56:56,920 --> 01:56:57,920
talking about.

1612
01:56:57,920 --> 01:57:03,360
There's a huge, I'm gonna say it because there's the word, there's conspiracy, there's complicity

1613
01:57:03,360 --> 01:57:05,160
all over the United States.

1614
01:57:05,160 --> 01:57:09,800
And you know, your poor military people are sitting there, they know, they are aware,

1615
01:57:09,800 --> 01:57:14,600
they know the manipulation, they know the expectations that they will be called upon

1616
01:57:14,600 --> 01:57:16,920
to move against the American people.

1617
01:57:16,920 --> 01:57:18,880
These people are heartsick.

1618
01:57:18,880 --> 01:57:25,160
They're heartsick of the portent of having to turn their guns against their own people.

1619
01:57:25,160 --> 01:57:30,080
And so they're walking out in droves, Alex, which is part of the plan because they already

1620
01:57:30,080 --> 01:57:33,520
have the collaborators lined up ready to take over.

1621
01:57:33,520 --> 01:57:34,520
That's right.

1622
01:57:34,520 --> 01:57:35,520
One of the first people-

1623
01:57:35,520 --> 01:57:37,840
Well, they should say yes, they will.

1624
01:57:37,840 --> 01:57:42,160
They should say yes, they will in this situation and infiltrate the New World Order.

1625
01:57:42,160 --> 01:57:47,640
I mean, that's completely biblical, just like the spies visiting the city and I mean, that's

1626
01:57:47,640 --> 01:57:48,640
gotta be done.

1627
01:57:48,640 --> 01:57:52,560
I say, just say, yeah, I'll fire on them, and then sit there and warn everybody behind

1628
01:57:52,560 --> 01:57:53,560
the scenes.

1629
01:57:53,560 --> 01:57:54,960
And I think that's the answer here.

1630
01:57:54,960 --> 01:57:59,980
Well, it would be great if they were left to that, if they weren't put in positions

1631
01:57:59,980 --> 01:58:03,480
where they have to actually say no all over the place.

1632
01:58:03,480 --> 01:58:04,960
And remember, these people are crafty.

1633
01:58:04,960 --> 01:58:05,960
Look at Obama.

1634
01:58:05,960 --> 01:58:12,160
Has anyone ever made Obama stand up in public where he was actually questioned about everything

1635
01:58:12,160 --> 01:58:13,160
in his past?

1636
01:58:13,160 --> 01:58:14,160
No, everything's always staged.

1637
01:58:14,160 --> 01:58:18,000
I mean, he's got three different names, everything's sealed.

1638
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,680
Yeah, what's with this?

1639
01:58:20,680 --> 01:58:26,800
What happened to a legal system that pulls back the onion and everyone has justice applied

1640
01:58:26,800 --> 01:58:27,800
to them equally?

1641
01:58:27,800 --> 01:58:31,200
Well, Obama, golly, gee, what's gone on with him?

1642
01:58:31,200 --> 01:58:32,200
Amazing.

1643
01:58:32,200 --> 01:58:34,920
So we've got to have you back up again soon.

1644
01:58:34,920 --> 01:58:35,920
Thank you so much, sir.

1645
01:58:35,920 --> 01:58:36,920
Thank you, Alex.

Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.

1650
01:58:53,880 --> 01:58:59,000
The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.

1651
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:05,040
The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce

1652
01:59:05,040 --> 01:59:06,040
to the global takeover.

1653
01:59:06,040 --> 01:59:12,040
That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.

1654
01:59:12,040 --> 01:59:15,720
These are items that I did research on that I personally use.

1655
01:59:15,720 --> 01:59:20,680
You've got the life straw so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.

1656
01:59:20,680 --> 01:59:25,400
The Ktor hand crank generator to charge up key equipment during power outages are out

1657
01:59:25,400 --> 01:59:26,400
in the field.

1658
01:59:26,400 --> 01:59:29,480
Strategic Relocation, third edition by Joel Skousen.

01:59:36,840 --> 01:59:39,720
Hand crank shortwave AM-FM radios.

1667
01:59:54,040 --> 02:00:05,640
Reaching war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.

1668
02:00:05,640 --> 02:00:10,520
Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.

1669
02:00:10,520 --> 02:00:11,520
You want answers?

1670
02:00:11,520 --> 02:00:13,640
Well, so does he.

1671
02:00:13,640 --> 02:00:17,840
He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.

1672
02:00:17,840 --> 02:00:24,480
And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.

1673
02:00:24,480 --> 02:00:37,640
That was such an amazing interview with Jim Garo.

1674
02:00:37,640 --> 02:00:42,040
And we've done some research on him the last 48 hours and were able to connect dots and

1675
02:00:42,040 --> 02:00:45,080
I was able to talk to him off air and get his response.

1676
02:00:45,080 --> 02:00:53,400
And I believe with about 97% certainty, actually I'm completely certain, that the individual

1677
02:00:53,400 --> 02:00:59,320
that told him that high-level military people that he recruited and gotten in special forces,

1678
02:00:59,320 --> 02:01:04,680
that the person that they're talking about is the man that's in the film Behold a Pale

1679
02:01:04,680 --> 02:01:10,960
Horse, available by the way at InfoWarsStore.com if you wanna get it there and support us.

1680
02:01:10,960 --> 02:01:18,200
But we're talking about retired former head of special forces, General William Boykin.

1681
02:01:18,200 --> 02:01:21,960
Because of the Christian circles and I happen to know Boykin's been involved trying to help

1682
02:01:21,960 --> 02:01:26,820
get Chinese girls out of China so they're not aborted.

1683
02:01:26,820 --> 02:01:31,520
After birth, they kill them up a couple years, parents hide them and stuff.

1684
02:01:31,520 --> 02:01:33,800
And it kind of freaked him out out there when I went out there and said, is it Boykin?

1685
02:01:33,800 --> 02:01:37,360
And the guy's like, I'm not gonna sit there and do this question and answer.

1686
02:01:37,360 --> 02:01:41,720
Boy, you really are smart, how do you know?

1687
02:01:41,720 --> 02:01:46,320
So the point is, is that, well, there's not many people that even have the courage to,

1688
02:01:46,320 --> 02:01:50,960
and of course, it's on record that he runs in the circles of Boykin and they know each

1689
02:01:50,960 --> 02:01:51,960
other.

1690
02:01:51,960 --> 02:01:56,200
And obviously, Boykin knows, the government knows that.

1691
02:01:56,200 --> 02:02:00,400
And I'm not saying he's not a really smart guy, but at the same time, he went to this

1692
02:02:00,400 --> 02:02:05,400
fella because he's like, well, you know about the internet, can I work through you?

1693
02:02:05,400 --> 02:02:08,920
We need to get a hold of the filmmaker, he's been trying to get a hold of me, I've just

1694
02:02:08,920 --> 02:02:09,920
been too busy to talk to him.

1695
02:02:09,920 --> 02:02:14,720
I've been too busy to even call my other source, I'm just completely overwhelmed at this point.

1696
02:02:14,720 --> 02:02:18,000
I mean, I'm gonna be honest with everybody, but I already know their battle plan.

1697
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:23,200
And I just continue to get more intel and more data on them and it's a bold move.

1698
02:02:23,200 --> 02:02:29,460
Fortune favors the bold and the globalist are bold, that's why I'm bold.

1699
02:02:29,460 --> 02:02:33,640
And Pat Tillman found out they were growing drugs and doing all this evil stuff in Afghanistan,

1700
02:02:33,640 --> 02:02:34,640
he was gonna go public.

1701
02:02:34,640 --> 02:02:36,880
So they killed him.

1702
02:02:36,880 --> 02:02:41,000
And I think General Boykin, he's already gone public and behold a pale horse.

1703
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:42,000
He's already exposed.

1704
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:48,700
Well, actually Boykin is in CNS news today saying our government is arming with Al-Qaeda

1705
02:02:48,700 --> 02:02:51,200
and giving them weapons in Syria.

1706
02:02:51,200 --> 02:02:54,520
So that's actually in the news today.

1707
02:02:54,520 --> 02:03:03,260
So it's Boykin, 97%, and I guess we need to get a hold of Boykin.

1708
02:03:03,260 --> 02:03:04,400
We know who to call to get his number.

1709
02:03:04,400 --> 02:03:06,840
I don't know why I haven't tried to get Boykin on to begin with.

1710
02:03:06,840 --> 02:03:11,680
And we need to just, I need to talk to him and go, look, General, it's time to just go

1711
02:03:11,680 --> 02:03:12,680
all the way.

1712
02:03:12,680 --> 02:03:15,820
It's time to get your missiles launched before they blow you up on the pad.

1713
02:03:15,820 --> 02:03:19,280
And I'm just telling you right now, ladies and gentlemen, that's what we gotta do.

1714
02:03:19,280 --> 02:03:21,880
And me, I'm in God's hands, I'm not worried about it.

1715
02:03:21,880 --> 02:03:27,640
He said the military living legend is scared.

1716
02:03:27,640 --> 02:03:32,320
And I guess when you're an old man admitting all that combat earlier and it's not even

1717
02:03:32,320 --> 02:03:34,300
scared, it's sad, freaked out.

1718
02:03:34,300 --> 02:03:36,240
It's like, wow, it's really happening.

1719
02:03:36,240 --> 02:03:39,320
They're really getting the military ready to come confiscate guns, have a civil war

1720
02:03:39,320 --> 02:03:41,040
and bring in the Chinese communist.

1721
02:03:41,040 --> 02:03:46,720
Let me tell you, a lot of mainline conservatives are all talk folks, they'll get out and salute

1722
02:03:46,720 --> 02:03:49,240
the Reds if they came in here, I'm telling you right now.

1723
02:03:49,240 --> 02:03:55,000
I mean, they'd line up, I mean, look, all the TV shows bad mouth George Washington.

1724
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:59,880
I mean, if they had a public hanging in Austin, for me, people get out there and salute while

1725
02:03:59,880 --> 02:04:01,520
they hung my butt.

1726
02:04:01,520 --> 02:04:07,520
I guarantee it, most people are cowards and they love evil, but I got news for the New

1727
02:04:07,520 --> 02:04:08,520
World Order.

1728
02:04:08,520 --> 02:04:14,200
There's a good 15% of people aren't gonna back down, and they're men and women.

1729
02:04:14,200 --> 02:04:20,200
And so good luck with that big highway that just got completed, almost all of it from

1730
02:04:20,200 --> 02:04:24,640
the southern Pacific side of Mexico right up into Texas.

1731
02:04:24,640 --> 02:04:29,720
And they've built it right up into San Antonio and right up to the extension around town.

1732
02:04:29,720 --> 02:04:34,520
And we stopped it just north of here, fighting it as hard as we could.

1733
02:04:34,520 --> 02:04:39,760
That globalist taxation control grid to run the Chinese troops up, we killed it dead just

1734
02:04:39,760 --> 02:04:41,480
north of Austin.

1735
02:04:41,480 --> 02:04:43,840
And here we are fighting as hard as we can.

1736
02:04:43,840 --> 02:04:49,640
And most people cannot believe how serious this is, how real this is, but you're gonna

1737
02:04:49,640 --> 02:04:51,440
find out.

1738
02:04:51,440 --> 02:05:01,080
We're trying to stop them, but if we don't stop them, boy, just remember you were warned.

1739
02:05:01,080 --> 02:05:05,360
Millions of people are going to get sick this winter from colds, flu, and other illnesses.

1740
02:05:05,360 --> 02:05:06,440
Don't be one of them.

1741
02:05:06,440 --> 02:05:11,440

1748
02:05:31,560 --> 02:05:33,120
other harmful pathogens.

1749
02:05:33,120 --> 02:05:38,000
This new technology has the ability to terminate entire colonies of harmful bacteria at several

1750
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:42,140
hundred times the effectiveness of colloidal or ionic silver solutions.

1751

Tyranny is here.

1770
02:07:06,220 --> 02:07:10,120
The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.

1771
02:07:10,120 --> 02:07:12,540
It really says that the state is God.

1772
02:07:12,540 --> 02:07:17,080
The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most impressive police states

1773
02:07:17,080 --> 02:07:18,320
on earth.

1774
02:07:18,320 --> 02:07:23,140
This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being

1775
02:07:23,140 --> 02:07:24,980
expanded nationwide.

1776

This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all

1777
02:07:29,160 --> 02:07:31,080
powerful shadow state.

1778
02:07:31,080 --> 02:07:35,440

1786
02:08:07,560 --> 02:08:22,360
That's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.

1787
02:08:22,360 --> 02:08:38,680
All right.

1788
02:08:38,680 --> 02:09:00,240
Students, what they think of President Obama's assault weapons ban.

1789
02:09:00,240 --> 02:09:03,680
If the feds start confiscating assault weapons, will you turn your guns in?

1790
02:09:03,680 --> 02:09:04,680
Absolutely not.

1791
02:09:04,680 --> 02:09:05,680
No chance.

1792
02:09:05,680 --> 02:09:11,080
I completely disagree with what President Obama said the other day in his order and

1793
02:09:11,080 --> 02:09:12,080
all that.

1794
02:09:12,080 --> 02:09:15,320
And I will not turn any of my guns in and there's nothing they can really do that will

1795
02:09:15,320 --> 02:09:16,640
change my mind about that.

1796
02:09:16,640 --> 02:09:22,800
Well, personally, I don't have any guns on me, but if I did, I probably wouldn't.

1797
02:09:22,800 --> 02:09:27,240
Just a matter of protection for myself or if I had a family for my family.

1798
02:09:27,240 --> 02:09:32,440
I don't own any guns, so I don't have any to turn in.

1799
02:09:32,440 --> 02:09:34,280
Do you think other people should turn them in?

1800
02:09:34,280 --> 02:09:35,280
I do.

1801
02:09:35,280 --> 02:09:39,200
I think you should follow the law and also I'm kind of against assault weapon guns and

1802
02:09:39,200 --> 02:09:43,400
guns in general and I don't see that there's that much of a need for them.

1803
02:09:43,400 --> 02:09:47,400
If everyone turns them in, then you won't need them to defend against other people with.

1804
02:09:47,400 --> 02:09:53,000
I don't own any assault weapons, but I am a gun owner and my guns would be in compliance

1805
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:56,400
with those new laws and so it wouldn't personally affect me.

1806
02:09:56,400 --> 02:10:03,120
But if I did own assault weapons, I would comply with the law because I don't think

1807
02:10:03,120 --> 02:10:09,300
that other than the headstrong southern attitude that what's mine is mine, there's no reason

1808
02:10:09,300 --> 02:10:13,520
to be owning assault weapons in a just personal setting.

1809
02:10:13,520 --> 02:10:18,720
How do you feel about President Obama bringing children on stage as he talks about gun control,

1810
02:10:18,720 --> 02:10:22,720
yet he's killed at least 168 kids in drone attacks in Pakistan?

1811
02:10:22,720 --> 02:10:27,840
I think national security and domestic security are two different issues and that security

1812
02:10:27,840 --> 02:10:32,080
abroad is a separate issue entirely from security inside the nation.

1813
02:10:32,080 --> 02:10:35,720
I feel that's kind of almost super critical in a way.

1814
02:10:35,720 --> 02:10:37,120
Yeah, I don't agree with that.

1815
02:10:37,120 --> 02:10:40,560
I think that dragging kids into it and having them listen to all this stuff, they do need

1816
02:10:40,560 --> 02:10:44,000
to be educated, but I think they're way too young and I think that's wrong.

1817
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:45,160
I don't agree with that at all.

1818
02:10:45,160 --> 02:10:48,400
I mean, I don't think it's fair to bring kids onto the stage as he talks about it.

1819
02:10:48,400 --> 02:10:53,840
It's kind of unfair to make his point that way, but I think a life's a life and it shouldn't

1820
02:10:53,840 --> 02:10:55,000
be lost either way.

1821
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:58,000
So I think it needs to be on both sides.

1822
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:03,240
It needs to value the life of the children as much as Pakistani civilians.

1823
02:11:03,240 --> 02:11:07,800
Maybe he feels bad about all the kids that he has unintentionally killed and he's trying

1824
02:11:07,800 --> 02:11:11,920
to make up for that by saying that, by bringing the kids on stage.

1825
02:11:11,920 --> 02:11:18,200
No one is... He's not... In the way of asking the question, that way you're making the blame

1826
02:11:18,200 --> 02:11:22,480
go specifically on a single person on the President of the United States when it's a

1827
02:11:22,480 --> 02:11:27,120
much more complicated and complex issue and then in those sort of situations you can't

1828
02:11:27,120 --> 02:11:28,960
place the blame on one person.

1829
02:11:28,960 --> 02:11:32,440
Yes, people have died, but people die in any sort of conflict.

1830
02:11:32,440 --> 02:11:36,240
I don't personally agree with our presence in the Middle East, but I'm going to support

1831
02:11:36,240 --> 02:11:40,040
our President in the sort of decisions he makes and I think that having drones in the

1832
02:11:40,040 --> 02:11:45,400
Middle East saves American lives and when it comes down to it, American lives are what

1833
02:11:45,400 --> 02:11:47,720
our policies are about saving.

1834
02:11:47,720 --> 02:11:52,080
Now do you think it's un-American if local or state governments push back on the feds

1835
02:11:52,080 --> 02:11:54,960
in relation to the assault weapons ban?

1836
02:11:54,960 --> 02:11:56,080
No.

1837
02:11:56,080 --> 02:12:01,800
I don't think it's un-American just because I think that within America each state does

1838
02:12:01,800 --> 02:12:06,960
have its right to make their own laws.

1839
02:12:06,960 --> 02:12:09,680
I don't think that it's un-American.

1840
02:12:09,680 --> 02:12:20,440
I find that states, when they have enough reason to stray away from the national government,

1841
02:12:20,440 --> 02:12:22,640
it is their right to do that.

1842
02:12:22,640 --> 02:12:27,040
I guess it would be considered un-American to push the feds back because these are the

1843
02:12:27,040 --> 02:12:30,960
same people that we expect to protect us and we're the same people who we expect to watch

1844
02:12:30,960 --> 02:12:34,120
our homeland security.

1845
02:12:34,120 --> 02:12:36,800
And lastly, can you recite the Second Amendment?

1846
02:12:36,800 --> 02:12:38,440
The Second Amendment.

1847
02:12:38,440 --> 02:12:40,800
No, I cannot at this point.

1848
02:12:40,800 --> 02:12:41,800
I forgot clearly.

1849
02:12:41,800 --> 02:12:49,360
On the first one, freedom of speech, the second one should be right to the press, isn't it?

1850
02:12:49,360 --> 02:12:50,360
Right to press.

1851
02:12:50,360 --> 02:12:52,800
Or it's probably that.

1852
02:12:52,800 --> 02:12:56,880
I should feel ashamed of myself, though, wanting to be a lawyer.

1853
02:12:56,880 --> 02:12:58,540
The right to bear arms.

1854
02:12:58,540 --> 02:13:01,480
Every citizen should have the right to bear arms.

1855
02:13:01,480 --> 02:13:06,000
And it mentions in there something about a militia.

1856
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:07,800
I used to know it.

1857
02:13:07,800 --> 02:13:09,600
I'm sorry.

1858
02:13:09,600 --> 02:13:10,600
The right to bear arms.

1859
02:13:10,600 --> 02:13:11,600
Okay.

1860
02:13:11,600 --> 02:13:16,160
And it mentions something about a militia in the Second Amendment.

1861
02:13:16,160 --> 02:13:17,160
Okay.

1862
02:13:17,160 --> 02:13:20,920
No, I have no idea what it is.

1863
02:13:20,920 --> 02:13:24,320
Could you say it to me?

1864
02:13:24,320 --> 02:13:25,640
I cannot.

1865
02:13:25,640 --> 02:13:33,000
Reporting for InfoWars Nightly News, I'm David Ortiz.

1866
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:47,480
There will be pundits and politicians and special interest lobbyists publicly warning

1867
02:13:47,480 --> 02:13:51,680
of a tyrannical all-out assault on liberty.

1868
02:13:51,680 --> 02:13:55,680
Alex Jones here for InfoWars.com with a special report.

1869
02:13:55,680 --> 02:14:00,600
Most people that watch television or even YouTube know that last Monday I debated Piers

1870
02:14:00,600 --> 02:14:05,960
Morgan and got in his face and said, look, you're coming for our guns to enslave us.

1871
02:14:05,960 --> 02:14:08,800
America is becoming a police state tyranny.

1872
02:14:08,800 --> 02:14:10,360
Back off.

1873
02:14:10,360 --> 02:14:11,600
Hitler took the guns.

1874
02:14:11,600 --> 02:14:12,920
Stalin took the guns.

1875
02:14:12,920 --> 02:14:13,920
Mao took the guns.

1876
02:14:13,920 --> 02:14:15,400
Fidel Castro took the guns.

1877
02:14:15,400 --> 02:14:16,880
Hugo Chavez took the guns.

1878
02:14:16,880 --> 02:14:22,480
And I'm here to tell you, 1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms.

1879
02:14:22,480 --> 02:14:25,680
Doesn't matter how many lemmings you get out there on the street begging for them to have

1880
02:14:25,680 --> 02:14:26,840
their guns taken.

1881
02:14:26,840 --> 02:14:28,320
We will not relinquish them.

1882
02:14:28,320 --> 02:14:30,280
Do you understand?

1883
02:14:30,280 --> 02:14:34,240
Two days later, Ron Paul came on my show, outgoing congressman, and he agreed.

1884
02:14:34,240 --> 02:14:40,400
He said, if they come for the guns, it's going to cause a civil war, 1776, part two.

1885
02:14:40,400 --> 02:14:42,400
Will you turn in your semi-autos?

1886
02:14:42,400 --> 02:14:50,520
Well, I might not even have anything to turn in for that purpose, but I don't think the

1887
02:14:50,520 --> 02:14:52,000
American people will.

1888
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:56,680
I've always assumed that the line in the sand may well be drawn.

1889
02:14:56,680 --> 02:15:01,920
If the federal agent marches in unannounced and they say, well, give me your gun and give

1890
02:15:01,920 --> 02:15:08,280
me your gold, I don't think that we'll do that, you know, in a calm way.

1891
02:15:08,280 --> 02:15:12,840
I think the American people will highly resent it and resist.

1892
02:15:12,840 --> 02:15:18,000
Now, as soon as I got off Piers Morgan, the White House released a press release and said

1893
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:24,160
they were watching and responded to our petition, your petition, to deport Piers Morgan for

1894
02:15:24,160 --> 02:15:30,580
engaging in political subterfuge and trying to overthrow our Bill of Rights and Constitution.

1895
02:15:30,580 --> 02:15:32,000
So we know they were watching.

1896
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:35,720
It became the biggest story in the country and the biggest story on Twitter for two days

1897
02:15:35,720 --> 02:15:36,720
straight.

1898
02:15:36,720 --> 02:15:39,360
It's had like 15 million views online on YouTube alone.

1899
02:15:39,360 --> 02:15:41,400
So we know the White House is watching.

1900
02:15:41,400 --> 02:15:46,600
We also know that it's come out in Homeland Security documents that myself and Matt Drudge

1901
02:15:46,600 --> 02:15:51,720
have been basically investigated and surveilled and are in secret documents concerning the

1902
02:15:51,720 --> 02:15:56,180
TSA because we've been covering their out of control violations of the Fourth Amendment

1903
02:15:56,180 --> 02:15:59,100
and conditioning the public to basically be slaves.

1904
02:15:59,100 --> 02:16:04,160
But then today I'm watching his speech while I'm live on the radio playing it.

1905
02:16:04,160 --> 02:16:08,360
And he talks about these pundits out there who just want to make money.

1906
02:16:08,360 --> 02:16:09,360
And they say that.

1907
02:16:09,360 --> 02:16:12,920
All right, ladies and gentlemen, we had some technical difficulties with the Skype, but

1908
02:16:12,920 --> 02:16:13,920
he's with us via phone.

1909
02:16:13,920 --> 02:16:17,320
So we were doing a retransmission of some special reports there for the rest of the

1910
02:16:17,320 --> 02:16:18,400
hour.

1911
02:16:18,400 --> 02:16:19,400
He's a busy guy.

1912
02:16:19,400 --> 02:16:25,160
Cenk Uygur, of course, founder and host of The Young Turks, theyoungturks.com, is on

1913
02:16:25,160 --> 02:16:26,160
with us.

1914
02:16:26,160 --> 02:16:30,000
He, of course, left MSNBC for several different reasons we're gonna talk about.

1915
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:35,080
He went over to Current TV with Al Gore involved and the Hyatts and others.

1916
02:16:35,080 --> 02:16:37,920
And then now that's been bought out by Al Jazeera.

1917
02:16:37,920 --> 02:16:39,360
And he joins us.

1918
02:16:39,360 --> 02:16:44,380
He has one of the biggest media networks on the Internet out there, probably only rivaled

1919
02:16:44,380 --> 02:16:50,600
by Infowars.com or what Glenn Beck has developed over there with The Blaze.

1920
02:16:50,600 --> 02:16:54,100
And then, of course, there's the big granddaddy of all the real alternative media and that's

1921
02:16:54,100 --> 02:16:55,100
DrudgeReport.com.

1922
02:16:55,100 --> 02:16:57,880
But, Cenk, it is good to have you on with us.

1923
02:16:57,880 --> 02:17:00,920
I was looking forward to the full hour, but you promised to come back soon, as soon as

1924
02:17:00,920 --> 02:17:03,080
we can get your Skype going for the TV viewers.

1925
02:17:03,080 --> 02:17:07,240
But the radio listeners out there excited to hear you on the broadcast.

1926
02:17:07,240 --> 02:17:11,960
Where should we begin in this discussion today?

1927
02:17:11,960 --> 02:17:19,400
You tell me, Alex, we can talk policy, we can talk shows, politics, you let me know.

1928
02:17:19,400 --> 02:17:20,720
Let's talk about you a little bit.

1929
02:17:20,720 --> 02:17:21,720
Most of the audience knows who you are.

1930
02:17:21,720 --> 02:17:22,720
But, I mean, how did you get started?

1931
02:17:22,720 --> 02:17:24,920
How did you form your political beliefs?

1932
02:17:24,920 --> 02:17:26,960
Good question.

1933
02:17:26,960 --> 02:17:31,280
So when I was growing up, I was a liberal Republican in the Northeast that, of course,

1934
02:17:31,280 --> 02:17:32,800
doesn't exist anymore.

1935
02:17:32,800 --> 02:17:33,800
But it did back in the day.

1936
02:17:33,800 --> 02:17:34,800
I voted for Tom Kane.

1937
02:17:34,800 --> 02:17:41,720
Not voted for, I was too young, but supported Tom Kane, Whitman, etc., right?

1938
02:17:41,720 --> 02:17:45,480
And then the Republicans lost me during George W. Bush.

1939
02:17:45,480 --> 02:17:50,360
Gore was actually the first Democrat I ever voted for in 2000.

1940
02:17:50,360 --> 02:17:52,880
They lost me on a couple things.

1941
02:17:52,880 --> 02:17:57,760
The Clinton affair was fun and funny, but I thought it was crazy to impeach a president

1942
02:17:57,760 --> 02:17:58,760
over that.

1943
02:17:58,760 --> 02:18:04,600
Then they really lost me during the Iraq War, and then they really lost me during torture,

1944
02:18:04,600 --> 02:18:10,680
and then they went down the spider hole of, you know, warrantless wiretapping, gigantic

1945
02:18:10,680 --> 02:18:16,560
abuses of our rights and civil liberties, etc., and I consider myself an independent.

1946
02:18:16,560 --> 02:18:19,640
The Democrats drive me absolutely crazy.

1947
02:18:19,640 --> 02:18:25,280
I am a progressive, meaning that I believe in expansion of freedom.

1948
02:18:25,280 --> 02:18:31,560
I believe in protecting the middle class, etc., and there are some progressives in Congress,

1949
02:18:31,560 --> 02:18:35,500
but not much, and Obama, I think, is nowhere near a progressive.

1950
02:18:35,500 --> 02:18:37,000
So that's your, in a nutshell.

1951
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:38,000
All right.

1952
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:42,560
We got you on later today, I'm gonna skip this network break coming up, because I wanna

1953
02:18:42,560 --> 02:18:44,760
get down to brass tax with you.

1954
02:18:44,760 --> 02:18:49,400
You're obviously a smart guy, and so you know that both parties are bought and paid for

1955
02:18:49,400 --> 02:18:54,600
by some of the very same globalist above the law, don't pay taxes interest.

1956
02:18:54,600 --> 02:18:59,520
And that, I mean, who can deny the police state has been continued and accelerated by

1957
02:18:59,520 --> 02:19:05,440
Obama with NDAA, they found torture camps in Benghazi, the rendition flights, all of

1958
02:19:05,440 --> 02:19:06,960
it is continuing.

1959
02:19:06,960 --> 02:19:12,300
And I've seen the so-called left suddenly become cheerleaders for it.

1960
02:19:12,300 --> 02:19:17,720
You not so much, but I mean, still, it's just another wing of the same carrion bird.

1961
02:19:17,720 --> 02:19:21,800
And then I come on your show and you're like, man, do you need mental help?

1962
02:19:21,800 --> 02:19:24,760
You're so upset about all this, I don't think it's a conspiracy.

1963
02:19:24,760 --> 02:19:26,960
Well, it's an open conspiracy.

1964
02:19:26,960 --> 02:19:31,480
I mean, don't you care about your family, Cenk, you're a smart guy.

1965
02:19:31,480 --> 02:19:36,840
You've got to know that if you've looked at history, the United States is absolutely headed

1966
02:19:36,840 --> 02:19:40,400
over the edge of a cliff, politically, economically, culturally.

1967
02:19:40,400 --> 02:19:48,560
I mean, this country is rotting socioeconomically on so many fronts morally, and the police

1968
02:19:48,560 --> 02:19:52,020
are dressed in Darth Vader outfits, the NSA spying on us.

1969
02:19:52,020 --> 02:19:55,600
And they're talking about Obama's gonna be the new Lincoln and crush the states, I mean,

1970
02:19:55,600 --> 02:19:56,600
this is creepy.

1971
02:19:56,600 --> 02:20:01,760
All right, so, Alex, I actually totally agree with you on three out of four things.

1972
02:20:01,760 --> 02:20:05,840
It's just the fourth one, we have a wild, complete disagreement, okay?

1973
02:20:05,840 --> 02:20:07,760
So let me tell you what I agree with you on.

1974
02:20:07,760 --> 02:20:10,360
So does money control politics?

1975
02:20:10,360 --> 02:20:11,920
Of course it does.

1976
02:20:11,920 --> 02:20:18,320
And watching television drives me crazy, where they talk about, oh, Joe Lieberman had this

1977
02:20:18,320 --> 02:20:24,520
policy idea and Senator X cares about this ideology, that's nonsense.

1978
02:20:24,520 --> 02:20:27,640
The only thing that matters is what their donors tell them to do.

1979
02:20:27,640 --> 02:20:32,200
I mean, New York Times had a brilliant article about how this pharmaceutical company, Amgen,

1980
02:20:32,200 --> 02:20:38,320
just bought a $500 million exemption in the latest fiscal cliff deal.

1981
02:20:38,320 --> 02:20:39,320
It makes me sick.

1982
02:20:39,320 --> 02:20:40,480
And by the way, who'd they buy?

1983
02:20:40,480 --> 02:20:46,320
They bought Republicans and Democrats, Max Baucus, Obama, McConnell, and Orrin Hatch.

1984
02:20:46,320 --> 02:20:48,440
So I totally agree on that.

1985
02:20:48,440 --> 02:20:52,240
Well, take Al Gore, take Al Gore getting all that oil money.

1986
02:20:52,240 --> 02:20:56,760
I mean, how many, tens of millions, what is it, 100 million some estimates?

1987
02:20:56,760 --> 02:21:02,280
And we all know that Al Jazeera is backed by a government.

1988
02:21:02,280 --> 02:21:05,040
Well, let me leave that aside for now.

1989
02:21:05,040 --> 02:21:08,640
We can get back into it because I don't think it's as directly pertinent to our current

1990
02:21:08,640 --> 02:21:12,280
sitting politicians that take the money for specific acts.

1991
02:21:12,280 --> 02:21:14,480
But let me just finish real quick.

1992
02:21:14,480 --> 02:21:19,680
Police state, I agree with you, the NDAA, warrantless wiretapping, it's encroaching

1993
02:21:19,680 --> 02:21:25,920
power begets power, and there's never an end to how much power they can have, okay?

1994
02:21:25,920 --> 02:21:30,200
So I agree with you on that, too.

1995
02:21:30,200 --> 02:21:34,760
But the final piece of the puzzle, when you talk about the reasons why, that's where

1996
02:21:34,760 --> 02:21:36,320
we have the huge disagreement, Alex.

1997
02:21:36,320 --> 02:21:38,480
And look, I think the reasons are super obvious.

1998
02:21:38,480 --> 02:21:44,200
I mean, you said a conspiracy out in the open, I mean, if you want to talk about a conspiracy

1999
02:21:44,200 --> 02:21:50,040
out in the open, the lobbyists say, we will give $100,000 to this guy, and we will hire

2000
02:21:50,040 --> 02:21:53,240
his chief of staff, and we will hire him after he retires.

2001
02:21:53,240 --> 02:21:56,880
They funnel all this money, and then they get the money back.

2002
02:21:56,880 --> 02:22:03,240
And then you've got Congress insider trading, so the power is all massing, and foreign corporations

2003
02:22:03,240 --> 02:22:06,200
and global corporations are taking control.

2004
02:22:06,200 --> 02:22:11,760
Don't you see then the wisdom for the people to be armed as a balance of power, as a check

2005
02:22:11,760 --> 02:22:12,760
and a balance?

2006
02:22:12,760 --> 02:22:16,680
I understand what you're saying there, Alex, but I think it's unrealistic in a couple of

2007
02:22:16,680 --> 02:22:20,440
different ways, and I think it has a huge downside, okay?

2008
02:22:20,440 --> 02:22:25,520
So number one, when I say it's unrealistic, look, man, we can have all the guns you want,

2009
02:22:25,520 --> 02:22:29,040
and we could be out in the woods when the government comes with drones, if they want

2010
02:22:29,040 --> 02:22:30,040
to do that.

2011
02:22:30,040 --> 02:22:33,760
I don't think they're gonna do that, but if they wanted to do that, I mean, they'd blow

2012
02:22:33,760 --> 02:22:34,760
us out of the sky.

2013
02:22:34,760 --> 02:22:38,280
You can have 28 AK-47s, you're never gonna be a drone.

2014
02:22:38,280 --> 02:22:39,280
Really?

2015
02:22:39,280 --> 02:22:40,280
Really?

2016
02:22:40,280 --> 02:22:41,280
200,000 US troops couldn't hold Baghdad.

2017
02:22:41,280 --> 02:22:45,120
I believe you're wrong about that, and our people are inside the military.

2018
02:22:45,120 --> 02:22:51,000
If they start trying to use the drones, even if they're automated and controlled by the

2019
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:55,080
globalist, the people in the military are gonna wreck those systems.

2020
02:22:55,080 --> 02:23:00,520
Humans are powerful machines, there's hundreds of millions of us, again, I've been to the

2021
02:23:00,520 --> 02:23:05,280
urban warfare drills where the military trains against US role players to confiscate guns

2022
02:23:05,280 --> 02:23:06,680
in US cities, Cenk.

2023
02:23:06,680 --> 02:23:11,880
I have the army manuals, in fact, I can give you one of them for gun confiscation in FEMA

2024
02:23:11,880 --> 02:23:17,840
camps and how to round up civil disturbance operations, FM3-39.40.

2025
02:23:17,840 --> 02:23:23,040
I mean, there I am giving you the actual document number, you can look it up.

2026
02:23:23,040 --> 02:23:25,060
This is real is what I'm telling you.

2027
02:23:25,060 --> 02:23:27,280
The 1.6 billion bullets the government bought.

2028
02:23:27,280 --> 02:23:31,000
I mean, if they've got drones, why do they want 1.6 billion bullets?

2029
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:33,840
Because it's boots on the ground, they're gonna have to come in our houses.

2030
02:23:33,840 --> 02:23:38,840
Well, I can answer why they want the 1.6 billion bullets, cuz somebody made money off of it.

2031
02:23:38,840 --> 02:23:44,520
There's a bullet maker, they bribed the legalized bribery that they do of politicians, and so

2032
02:23:44,520 --> 02:23:47,320
the government bought 1.6 billion bullets they don't need.

2033
02:23:47,320 --> 02:23:51,160
Like, there's one other point of agreement we have, which is that I think there's gonna

2034
02:23:51,160 --> 02:23:55,600
be a gigantic collapse coming, and I think what happens after the collapse is enormously

2035
02:23:55,600 --> 02:23:56,600
important.

2036
02:23:56,600 --> 02:24:02,360
And we might disagree as to why that collapse is coming, but our main point of disagreement

2037
02:24:02,360 --> 02:24:04,800
is when you start talking about the FEMA camps, et cetera.

2038
02:24:04,800 --> 02:24:09,200
Look, I don't think there's a government plan to put us in FEMA camps, or to kill us, or

2039
02:24:09,200 --> 02:24:12,160
to take us over, cuz they don't need it.

2040
02:24:12,160 --> 02:24:16,480
They already have the government, look, Alex, the only thing they care about is making more

2041
02:24:16,480 --> 02:24:17,480
money.

2042
02:24:17,480 --> 02:24:20,720
And right now, they have almost 100% control of the government, and they can make all the

2043
02:24:20,720 --> 02:24:21,920
money they want.

2044
02:24:21,920 --> 02:24:24,640
Why would they wanna disturb that system?

2045
02:24:24,640 --> 02:24:28,240
They're milking us dry on that count anyway.

2046
02:24:28,240 --> 02:24:34,200
Well, I get the points you're making, and it's true that we've already been taken over,

2047
02:24:34,200 --> 02:24:36,880
they're already looting us, so why physically do it?

2048
02:24:36,880 --> 02:24:40,120
It is the instinct of tyrants to fully dominate.

2049
02:24:40,120 --> 02:24:44,400
I mean, why did Hitler, after he'd already taken France, just not stop there?

2050
02:24:44,400 --> 02:24:48,640
Why did he turn off into Russia, where Napoleon and every other empire went to die?

2051
02:24:48,640 --> 02:24:53,520
It is the nature of these people, so you come off as a real guy, and I'm a pretty good judge

2052
02:24:53,520 --> 02:24:58,960
of people, and so you are judging other people by how you operate.

2053
02:24:58,960 --> 02:25:03,940
And I don't blame you not wanting to talk about Al Gore and people, but I mean, Al Gore

2054
02:25:03,940 --> 02:25:09,600
has the carbon trading company over in London, and would literally make money off of every

2055
02:25:09,600 --> 02:25:12,520
human activity we make if he gets carbon taxes through.

2056
02:25:12,520 --> 02:25:16,080
I mean, that isn't about the environment, it's about a power grab.

2057
02:25:16,080 --> 02:25:20,680
No, no, Alex, I don't mind talking about Gore, I wanted to talk about your specific question

2058
02:25:20,680 --> 02:25:21,680
first.

2059
02:25:21,680 --> 02:25:25,960
But look, I don't know all the investments that Al Gore has at all, right?

2060
02:25:25,960 --> 02:25:29,960
I do know somebody comes in, like Al just heard, and they make an offer that appears

2061
02:25:29,960 --> 02:25:35,000
to be fantastic, above market value, if you ask me, and I don't know the specifics, I'm

2062
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:38,720
just guessing from the outside, I'm not involved in the deal at all.

2063
02:25:38,720 --> 02:25:39,880
Anybody would have taken it.

2064
02:25:39,880 --> 02:25:44,400
So does that, I mean, he's not in power anymore politically, I don't, you know, so there isn't

2065
02:25:44,400 --> 02:25:49,080
any, I don't think any extra favors to be had, he just got an awesome price and he took

2066
02:25:49,080 --> 02:25:50,080
it.

2067
02:25:50,080 --> 02:25:57,680
Now, the carbon tax thing, look, I just don't believe at all that it's meant to be a money-making

2068
02:25:57,680 --> 02:26:03,440
enterprise, and I've talked to him at length for a long, long time, the man deeply cares

2069
02:26:03,440 --> 02:26:04,440
about global warming.

2070
02:26:04,440 --> 02:26:06,040
Now, you might disagree with him.

2071
02:26:06,040 --> 02:26:10,040
No, he deeply cares about the carbon's writing he'll make billions off of, of course he does.

2072
02:26:10,040 --> 02:26:14,000
He deeply cares about the Apple, Foxcom, suicide nets.

2073
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:15,000
Does he deeply care about the-

2074
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:17,760
Now, you told me you do the same thing, though, and here, let me explain what I mean by that.

2075
02:26:17,760 --> 02:26:22,480
Like, for example, you think the economy is in trouble, so you invest in gold, right?

2076
02:26:22,480 --> 02:26:23,480
We talked about that before.

2077
02:26:23,480 --> 02:26:24,480
Yes.

2078
02:26:24,480 --> 02:26:25,480
So then you make money off of that.

2079
02:26:25,480 --> 02:26:28,600
Well, if that makes sense to you, that's where you thought the economy was going.

2080
02:26:28,600 --> 02:26:32,040
I don't even blame the hedge fund guys like John Paulson, who thought, wait a minute,

2081
02:26:32,040 --> 02:26:36,040
these toxic mortgages are crap, I'm gonna bet against them, and they made billions off

2082
02:26:36,040 --> 02:26:37,120
of that, right?

2083
02:26:37,120 --> 02:26:42,320
So if Al Gore sees that this fossil fuel industry is unsustainable, and he's right about that,

2084
02:26:42,320 --> 02:26:47,040
and it's hurting our health, our wealth, everything else, and he bets in the opposite direction,

2085
02:26:47,040 --> 02:26:49,040
well, that's logical, I'd do the same thing.

2086
02:26:49,040 --> 02:26:53,240
Yeah, but carbon taxes are selectively enforced only against the West and designed to shut

2087
02:26:53,240 --> 02:26:56,880
down our development, and then move it to Chinese investments and Indian investments

2088
02:26:56,880 --> 02:26:58,640
that people like Al Gore have.

2089
02:26:58,640 --> 02:27:05,520
It's a managed crony capitalist economy, and it's completely cold-blooded.

2090
02:27:05,520 --> 02:27:10,000
It was Gore that got up there on Larry King Live and said, it's a great deal, Larry, I

2091
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:12,120
deeply believe in NAFTA and GATT.

2092
02:27:12,120 --> 02:27:14,080
How has NAFTA and GATT been for us?

2093
02:27:14,080 --> 02:27:19,800
Well, look, I was in favor of NAFTA, and I thought, even though I was a Republican at

2094
02:27:19,800 --> 02:27:25,400
the time, I thought Gore clearly won the debate against Ross Perot on that issue, et cetera,

2095
02:27:25,400 --> 02:27:29,960
but NAFTA has had some significant downsides, there's no question about that, and I'll tell

2096
02:27:29,960 --> 02:27:36,000
you, at this point, I get that a lot of the global trade deals are done for the benefit

2097
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:42,160
of corporations, and to our great detriment, I mean, look, I'll tell you, I'll give you

2098
02:27:42,160 --> 02:27:46,500
one example that really proves that case, it's the Panama deal, there's almost no trade

2099
02:27:46,500 --> 02:27:52,800
with Panama in terms of business, commodities, et cetera, but Panama protects the bankers,

2100
02:27:52,800 --> 02:27:58,120
and so recent trade deal that Obama did, he included Panama in the deal with other countries,

2101
02:27:58,120 --> 02:27:59,120
why?

2102
02:27:59,120 --> 02:28:03,040
Because it created a giant loophole for the bankers to pay no taxes.

2103
02:28:03,040 --> 02:28:05,000
Now, come on, why would you do that?

2104
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:09,560
I mean, especially if you're claiming to be a progressive, liberal Democrat, and you give

2105
02:28:09,560 --> 02:28:16,080
the bankers this giant, multi-billion dollar loophole, no, it's because the corporations

2106
02:28:16,080 --> 02:28:20,960
run the place, Dick Durbin said it, he said, the banks own Capitol Hill.

2107
02:28:20,960 --> 02:28:24,600
So on that count, there's no question.

2108
02:28:24,600 --> 02:28:34,020
We're talking to the founder of the popular internet and TV and radio empire, Jink joins

2109
02:28:34,020 --> 02:28:41,320
us right now, theyoungturks.com is the main website, one of many they have.

2110
02:28:41,320 --> 02:28:45,600
Look, here's how my brain works.

2111
02:28:45,600 --> 02:28:48,040
They're sitting there going, come on.

2112
02:28:48,040 --> 02:28:52,720
So Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, a few others, they knew the derivatives were garbage, so

2113
02:28:52,720 --> 02:28:53,720
they bet against them.

2114
02:28:53,720 --> 02:29:00,280
Yeah, but they also sold them to their clients and originally got the law changed in 99 to

2115
02:29:00,280 --> 02:29:01,840
be able to sell the crap.

2116
02:29:01,840 --> 02:29:02,840
So they-

2117
02:29:02,840 --> 02:29:03,840
Totally true.

2118
02:29:03,840 --> 02:29:04,840
Totally true.

2119
02:29:04,840 --> 02:29:05,840
That was fraud.

2120
02:29:05,840 --> 02:29:09,800
And so when you talk about the guys who sold it to their clients and then shorted it and

2121
02:29:09,800 --> 02:29:12,360
then bet against it, well, that's just outright fraud.

2122
02:29:12,360 --> 02:29:17,000
Those guys should be in jail and Goldman Sachs and all those guys did it and then John Polson,

2123
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:24,720
so I might've picked a poor example because he worked with Goldman Sachs to sell the toxic

2124
02:29:24,720 --> 02:29:27,440
stuff to other people while he was betting against it.

2125
02:29:27,440 --> 02:29:32,920
But there were some people, like if you read the big short by, was it Michael Lewis?

2126
02:29:32,920 --> 02:29:37,760
Stay there, Jink, Uger is our guest and we're going to be right back, founder and head of

2127
02:29:37,760 --> 02:29:38,760
the Young Turks.

2128
02:29:38,760 --> 02:29:42,120
We're going to get into a whole bunch of other issues, second amendment, you name it.

2129
02:29:42,120 --> 02:29:44,520
And what he thinks the collapse is going to look like.

2130
02:29:44,520 --> 02:29:46,480
And is he worried about martial law?

2131
02:29:46,480 --> 02:29:50,640
All this and more coming up.

2132
02:29:50,640 --> 02:29:51,920
We're on the march.

2133
02:29:51,920 --> 02:29:54,320
The empire's on the run.

2134
02:29:54,320 --> 02:30:01,920
Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.

2135
02:30:01,920 --> 02:30:06,760
Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive from natural disasters

2136
02:30:06,760 --> 02:30:11,340
like hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on

2137
02:30:11,340 --> 02:30:13,200
by a disastrous economy?

2138
02:30:13,200 --> 02:30:15,920
Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything.

2139
02:30:15,920 --> 02:30:19,720
At e foods direct, we hear from customers every day that are fortunate enough to weather

2140
02:30:19,720 --> 02:30:22,640
life storm by having a supply of food on hand.

2141
02:30:22,640 --> 02:30:27,180
After hurricane Sandy, Danny from New York city wrote, almost all the grocery stores

2142
02:30:27,180 --> 02:30:32,000
are closed, but I managed to get my e foods just in time to be able to help my sister

2143
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:33,000
and niece.

2144
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:36,800
It is better to be prepared 10 years too early than one day too late.

2145
02:30:36,800 --> 02:30:39,040
I can warn you, but I can't feed you.

The empire is on the run.

2181
02:33:08,400 --> 02:33:12,200
Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

2182
02:33:12,200 --> 02:33:20,520
Jinky Uygur of the Young Turks is our guest and they've had a lot of fun with me over

2183
02:33:20,520 --> 02:33:22,800
the years making jokes out of things.

2184
02:33:22,800 --> 02:33:30,520
Talk about the CPS taking people's kids, we can discuss that.

2185
02:33:30,520 --> 02:33:35,240
Also the so-called liberal media is running like a four year old video of me talking about

2186
02:33:35,240 --> 02:33:38,880
juice boxes to make you gay and they take it out of context.

2187
02:33:38,880 --> 02:33:45,360
I'm pointing out that animals, mammals, you name it, are becoming sterile or bisexual

2188
02:33:45,360 --> 02:33:47,120
or having both organs.

2189
02:33:47,120 --> 02:33:53,260
Girls are going into puberty now at average of age 10, used to be 14, boys, testicles

2190
02:33:53,260 --> 02:33:57,360
are not dropping, genitals are smaller, they're becoming feminine, women are becoming hyper

2191
02:33:57,360 --> 02:34:04,400
feminine, the bisphenol and other things are directly linked to cancer and infertility.

2192
02:34:04,400 --> 02:34:07,860
All of this and the media just says, you're making fun of gay people, it has nothing to

2193
02:34:07,860 --> 02:34:08,860
do with that.

2194
02:34:08,860 --> 02:34:13,440
It's a way to get the news out to say, are the juice boxes making you gay coming up?

2195
02:34:13,440 --> 02:34:16,400
And then I'm like, well, actually it's doing a bunch of stuff.

2196
02:34:16,400 --> 02:34:18,600
But what's your take on that, Jink?

2197
02:34:18,600 --> 02:34:27,020
All right, so first of all, I'm joking around with stuff and we drive people crazy and people

2198
02:34:27,020 --> 02:34:30,520
don't like it when we joke around about them, but we do it all the time and we do it to

2199
02:34:30,520 --> 02:34:31,520
everybody.

2200
02:34:31,520 --> 02:34:32,520
Okay.

2201
02:34:32,520 --> 02:34:36,240
And the audience likes serious stuff, but they like lighthearted stuff too.

2202
02:34:36,240 --> 02:34:41,160
And so, and Paul Krugman the other day got all hurt over John Stewart making fun of him,

2203
02:34:41,160 --> 02:34:44,120
but that's just life and everybody's got to get used to that.

2204
02:34:44,120 --> 02:34:47,840
People make fun of us all the time and that just rolls off my back.

2205
02:34:47,840 --> 02:34:51,240
No, no, I don't mind you making fun of me, I mean, I'm a funny guy as well, I think you're

2206
02:34:51,240 --> 02:34:52,240
a funny guy.

2207
02:34:52,240 --> 02:34:55,520
I mean, how does that tie into the juice box stuff?

2208
02:34:55,520 --> 02:34:56,520
Okay.

2209
02:34:56,520 --> 02:34:57,520
They're really saying that I'm-

2210
02:34:57,520 --> 02:35:02,080
Okay, so on that front, on that front, look, you know, you mentioned three different things

2211
02:35:02,080 --> 02:35:03,080
there.

2212
02:35:03,080 --> 02:35:04,080
Let me take child protective services.

2213
02:35:04,080 --> 02:35:09,960
Now, this is, again, it goes to our fundamental disagreement, Alex, like if you say that child

2214
02:35:09,960 --> 02:35:14,520
protective services goes too far in some instances, I'm going to totally agree with you.

2215
02:35:14,520 --> 02:35:19,280
And I bet you could find five, 10, 20, 100 cases throughout the country where you say,

2216
02:35:19,280 --> 02:35:20,680
look at this, look at this, look at this.

2217
02:35:20,680 --> 02:35:24,760
Now, if you think child protection services is some sort of conspiracy where they're all

2218
02:35:24,760 --> 02:35:29,120
coordinating with one another to take people's kids, that's where I totally disagree with

2219
02:35:29,120 --> 02:35:30,120
you.

2220
02:35:30,120 --> 02:35:33,880
I got a neighbor who's in that, my wife used to be in that, there's no conspiracy.

2221
02:35:33,880 --> 02:35:37,280
They're trying to do the best they can, and a lot of times people screw up.

2222
02:35:37,280 --> 02:35:38,280
That's it.

2223
02:35:38,280 --> 02:35:39,520
Well, let me add my point.

2224
02:35:39,520 --> 02:35:44,560
Half of CPS roughly, about 54% nationally, people can look these numbers up, turns over.

2225
02:35:44,560 --> 02:35:49,040
Because people get in it for the right reasons, and it's so bad most people quit.

2226
02:35:49,040 --> 02:35:50,440
Sounds like your wife did.

2227
02:35:50,440 --> 02:35:53,440
I know there's about 50% or more that are good people.

2228
02:35:53,440 --> 02:35:57,200
But you are five times more likely, according to the Justice Department, even Time Magazine's

2229
02:35:57,200 --> 02:36:03,480
covered this, to be abused in government custody, CPS, than you are in anybody else's custody.

2230
02:36:03,480 --> 02:36:09,520
They put the average foster child on seven psychotropics, 67% are on psychotropics.

2231
02:36:09,520 --> 02:36:10,920
I mean, it is a mill.

2232
02:36:10,920 --> 02:36:12,760
But Alex, that's not a conspiracy.

2233
02:36:12,760 --> 02:36:16,440
So they over-prescribe, I agree with you, and if you're talking about, hey, there's

2234
02:36:16,440 --> 02:36:22,120
a financial incentive for the drug companies to set up an incentive system so they over-prescribe,

2235
02:36:22,120 --> 02:36:23,120
I'm with you.

2236
02:36:23,120 --> 02:36:25,560
And I think they over-prescribe, right?

2237
02:36:25,560 --> 02:36:29,320
But it's not like the government's saying, okay, ha, ha, ha, we will get these kids and

2238
02:36:29,320 --> 02:36:32,720
we'll put them on psychotropic drugs and we will, you know.

2239
02:36:32,720 --> 02:36:34,920
It doesn't work on that way.

2240
02:36:34,920 --> 02:36:38,400
It's actually in some ways more malicious than that in the sense that once you set up

2241
02:36:38,400 --> 02:36:41,520
a machine to do X, it will keep doing X.

2242
02:36:41,520 --> 02:36:45,160
And so they've turned government into a money-making machine.

2243
02:36:45,160 --> 02:36:49,920
So there is no smoke-filled room where CPS got together and said, let's drug up the kids.

2244
02:36:49,920 --> 02:36:54,600
It's just, if the drug companies have the financial incentive, they buy the politicians,

2245
02:36:54,600 --> 02:36:55,600
the politicians write the rules-

2246
02:36:55,600 --> 02:36:56,600
Okay.

2247
02:36:56,600 --> 02:36:57,600
Then my point is-

2248
02:36:57,600 --> 02:36:58,600
They wind up having more drugs.

2249
02:36:58,600 --> 02:37:02,700
Regardless then, it's going on, we should stand up and say it's wrong.

2250
02:37:02,700 --> 02:37:08,120
But the Democrats generally are pro-government and so, no, let's not criticize the government.

2251
02:37:08,120 --> 02:37:09,600
Let's just let it continue on.

2252
02:37:09,600 --> 02:37:12,160
The Republicans are pro-government to their buddies.

2253
02:37:12,160 --> 02:37:14,060
They don't want their stuff cut either.

2254
02:37:14,060 --> 02:37:19,000
And all I'm saying is, like Nixon said, it is a big out of control beast.

2255
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:23,840
It is an out of control machine that nobody can control except the establishment on top

2256
02:37:23,840 --> 02:37:27,680
is trying to ride the beast and we're being trampled under it.

2257
02:37:27,680 --> 02:37:34,240
Yeah, and look, when people ask, is government too big, too small, that's my favorite question

2258
02:37:34,240 --> 02:37:36,000
because it makes no sense.

2259
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:38,280
It's like saying, all right, how big a pipe do you need?

2260
02:37:38,280 --> 02:37:39,840
Well, I don't know.

2261
02:37:39,840 --> 02:37:40,840
What's the job we're doing?

2262
02:37:40,840 --> 02:37:41,840
Are we carrying oil?

2263
02:37:41,840 --> 02:37:43,840
Are we carrying a tiny amount of water?

2264
02:37:43,840 --> 02:37:44,840
What do you mean?

2265
02:37:44,840 --> 02:37:46,560
Well, how big is the pipe you want, right?

2266
02:37:46,560 --> 02:37:50,040
So it depends on the job that the government is doing.

2267
02:37:50,040 --> 02:37:55,480
So is the government too large when it has this enormously bloated Defense Department?

2268
02:37:55,480 --> 02:37:56,800
It starts aggressive wars?

2269
02:37:56,800 --> 02:37:58,880
Hell yeah, it's too large.

2270
02:37:58,880 --> 02:38:01,280
Is it too large when it gets into our private lives?

2271
02:38:01,280 --> 02:38:04,120
In my case, I think, you know, I'm pro-choice.

2272
02:38:04,120 --> 02:38:10,040
I think them getting between us and our doctor is way too large, you know, and so you can

2273
02:38:10,040 --> 02:38:11,840
list a dozen ways that it's too large.

2274
02:38:11,840 --> 02:38:14,680
You can also list a dozen ways that I think it's too small.

2275
02:38:14,680 --> 02:38:19,800
Like, for example, the whole reason why I'm not a small-time olive picker in the middle

2276
02:38:19,800 --> 02:38:24,660
of southeastern Turkey is because the Turkish government allowed my dad to get a free education

2277
02:38:24,660 --> 02:38:27,520
because he scored high on an interest exam.

2278
02:38:27,520 --> 02:38:31,800
That's the government saying, hey, we're going to give everybody an opportunity with their

2279
02:38:31,800 --> 02:38:32,800
poor...

2280
02:38:32,800 --> 02:38:36,800
They do that to find, under the eugenics model, and I'm not saying, I'm not judging Turkey's

2281
02:38:36,800 --> 02:38:37,800
models.

2282
02:38:37,800 --> 02:38:41,520
I'm not enough of an expert on it, you know, 60 years ago or whatever, though I know quite

2283
02:38:41,520 --> 02:38:44,160
a bit more than the general public does about the history of it.

2284
02:38:44,160 --> 02:38:49,760
My issue is they do that to pick and find the brains to make sure that there aren't

2285
02:38:49,760 --> 02:38:55,600
what they call wild sons or bad sons out there that grow up and get power outside of the

2286
02:38:55,600 --> 02:38:56,840
power structure.

2287
02:38:56,840 --> 02:38:57,840
Let's expand on this.

2288
02:38:57,840 --> 02:39:05,480
Golfer Phil Mickelson pays over 63, 64% in federal and just state income tax.

2289
02:39:05,480 --> 02:39:10,480
If you add in the property tax and all the other taxes, it's over about 74% for somebody

2290
02:39:10,480 --> 02:39:12,280
making as much money as he does.

2291
02:39:12,280 --> 02:39:13,280
Come on.

2292
02:39:13,280 --> 02:39:14,280
I don't believe that.

2293
02:39:14,280 --> 02:39:15,280
I don't believe that.

2294
02:39:15,280 --> 02:39:16,280
Well, I mean...

2295
02:39:16,280 --> 02:39:17,480
I don't think that's accurate at all.

2296
02:39:17,480 --> 02:39:20,200
I pay close to 60% in taxes.

2297
02:39:20,200 --> 02:39:26,360
Yeah, I mean, look, if you're adding everything, if you're adding local taxes, property taxes,

2298
02:39:26,360 --> 02:39:30,560
which is a whole different ballgame, sales tax, you might get the 60%.

2299
02:39:30,560 --> 02:39:33,760
But if you've got the 60%, that means you're making a hell of a good living.

2300
02:39:33,760 --> 02:39:38,920
I mean, I got friends making millions of dollars and then they say that in the end, and they

2301
02:39:38,920 --> 02:39:42,000
live in New York, which is heavily taxed, they're at around 50%.

2302
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:44,040
Yeah, worse than that.

2303
02:39:44,040 --> 02:39:45,040
Are you kidding?

2304
02:39:45,040 --> 02:39:46,040
In New York?

2305
02:39:46,040 --> 02:39:54,720
Hey, Obama just hired that French researcher, top economist lady, to help tune international

2306
02:39:54,720 --> 02:39:56,480
economics with the US.

2307
02:39:56,480 --> 02:40:02,400
That woman is somebody pushing for the 75% taxes on top of everything you make above

2308
02:40:02,400 --> 02:40:03,400
75%.

2309
02:40:03,400 --> 02:40:05,840
I mean, the government needs 90%.

2310
02:40:05,840 --> 02:40:07,080
France is the model.

2311
02:40:07,080 --> 02:40:10,960
Futile serfs only paid 10% in ancient Europe.

2312
02:40:10,960 --> 02:40:15,840
But Alex, if you remember the golden years of America from about 1945 to 1980, when our

2313
02:40:15,840 --> 02:40:22,080
economy did the best, more accurately, probably 45 to 75, the tax rate was anywhere between

2314
02:40:22,080 --> 02:40:23,080
71 to 94%.

2315
02:40:23,080 --> 02:40:27,120
But the loopholes were so big, that's not actually the case.

2316
02:40:27,120 --> 02:40:30,200
Kennedy cut some of the highest tax rates by 35%.

2317
02:40:30,200 --> 02:40:32,560
The median tax income by 50%.

2318
02:40:32,560 --> 02:40:33,640
Tax receipts doubled.

2319
02:40:33,640 --> 02:40:37,920
Why does government want higher taxes when they know generally tax cuts increases revenue?

2320
02:40:37,920 --> 02:40:39,720
Or do you disagree with that?

2321
02:40:39,720 --> 02:40:41,280
I do disagree with that.

2322
02:40:41,280 --> 02:40:45,520
So when Kennedy cut taxes, they were still above 70%.

2323
02:40:45,520 --> 02:40:47,840
And remember, that's for the highest marginal tax rate.

2324
02:40:47,840 --> 02:40:52,940
So that's for every dollar above whatever the threshold is, right?

2325
02:40:52,940 --> 02:40:59,000
So if Kennedy doubled the revenue and he was at 70% for the highest marginal tax rate,

2326
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:00,000
well, that's not so bad.

2327
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:01,660
Now, look, I think that's too high.

2328
02:41:01,660 --> 02:41:07,160
For my personal taste, I think, and that's why my family supported Reagan when we first

2329
02:41:07,160 --> 02:41:08,160
came here.

2330
02:41:08,160 --> 02:41:11,520
Because at that time, if you remember before Reagan, the highest marginal tax rate was

2331
02:41:11,520 --> 02:41:12,520
70%.

2332
02:41:12,520 --> 02:41:14,440
I thought that was outrageously high.

2333
02:41:14,440 --> 02:41:17,280
But now we've got it to a point where it's far too low.

2334
02:41:17,280 --> 02:41:21,960
Look, when Clinton raised the taxes to 39% for the top rate, what happened?

2335
02:41:21,960 --> 02:41:24,640
The economy, boom, we added 23 million jobs.

2336
02:41:24,640 --> 02:41:27,120
Bush cut it, also Obama cut it.

2337
02:41:27,120 --> 02:41:28,120
And what happened?

2338
02:41:28,120 --> 02:41:29,120
We lost jobs.

2339
02:41:29,120 --> 02:41:30,120
We didn't gain jobs.

2340
02:41:30,120 --> 02:41:31,120
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

2341
02:41:31,120 --> 02:41:36,240
Obama promised not to increase payroll tax, and he increased it on 77% of Americans.

2342
02:41:36,240 --> 02:41:39,940
People making $30,000 got an increase, what, 3.8%.

2343
02:41:39,940 --> 02:41:42,400
There's all sorts of taxes being increased.

2344
02:41:42,400 --> 02:41:43,960
Here's my big issue with taxes.

2345
02:41:43,960 --> 02:41:48,920
If you had an angel, a good angel, distributing it all, it would still make people slaves

2346
02:41:48,920 --> 02:41:52,580
in the final equation and not make you independent and make you domesticated.

2347
02:41:52,580 --> 02:41:57,040
The establishment, the richest people in the world, come and lobby for higher taxes cuz

2348
02:41:57,040 --> 02:42:01,080
they know they're always gonna have loopholes and are exempt, Warren Buffett and people

2349
02:42:01,080 --> 02:42:02,080
like that.

2350
02:42:02,080 --> 02:42:04,920
And then they end up getting the money in banker bailouts and corporate welfare.

2351
02:42:04,920 --> 02:42:10,840
They're trying to shut down the Small Business Association in the federal government administration.

2352
02:42:10,840 --> 02:42:14,880
They take our tax money and then they give it back to select insiders.

2353
02:42:14,880 --> 02:42:16,920
I mean, that's what's going on here.

2354
02:42:16,920 --> 02:42:18,680
Some of that is true.

2355
02:42:18,680 --> 02:42:23,080
For example, the role of how big business crushes small business is one of the most

2356
02:42:23,080 --> 02:42:27,080
underreported stories in the country because they want a competitive advantage so they

2357
02:42:27,080 --> 02:42:32,240
set the rules in the government so that it is to their advantage and against small businesses.

2358
02:42:32,240 --> 02:42:36,640
But no, overall, most of the rich don't want higher taxes at all.

2359
02:42:36,640 --> 02:42:40,600
Warren Buffett is someone that everybody talks about cuz he's such an exception.

2360
02:42:40,600 --> 02:42:45,760
All the hedge fund guys, the private equity guys on Wall Street, cry bloody murder if

2361
02:42:45,760 --> 02:42:50,760
you touch their taxes by 1% and they're paying 15%, which is outrageously low.

2362
02:42:50,760 --> 02:42:52,480
Yeah, they wrote the laws.

2363
02:42:52,480 --> 02:42:53,480
They wrote the laws.

2364
02:42:53,480 --> 02:42:57,680
And it's the very same mega banks and Wall Street people that fund the Democrats and

2365
02:42:57,680 --> 02:42:58,680
Republicans.

2366
02:42:58,680 --> 02:42:59,680
I mean, look at Romney.

2367
02:42:59,680 --> 02:43:03,880
He was funded by the exact same groups, except for the Koch brothers, so you guys always

2368
02:43:03,880 --> 02:43:05,420
use them all day.

2369
02:43:05,420 --> 02:43:07,920
But the point is, is that now they flipped against the Republicans.

2370
02:43:07,920 --> 02:43:13,840
I mean, it's just such a cynical game and any big government is gonna create that trough

2371
02:43:13,840 --> 02:43:16,680
for the fraud, waste, and abuse to take place.

2372
02:43:16,680 --> 02:43:17,680
That's totally true.

2373
02:43:17,680 --> 02:43:23,760
And the Democrats and Republicans are playing us all day long and Fox News and MSNBC set

2374
02:43:23,760 --> 02:43:28,680
up this false debate, this false drama, my God, is it gonna be the Democrats, is it gonna

2375
02:43:28,680 --> 02:43:29,920
be the Republicans?

2376
02:43:29,920 --> 02:43:30,920
What difference does it make?

2377
02:43:30,920 --> 02:43:36,400
Obama renewed, in fact, he didn't just renew, he made the Bush tax cuts permanent for 99%

2378
02:43:36,400 --> 02:43:37,400
of Americans.

2379
02:43:37,400 --> 02:43:39,480
So that's the 1% change we voted for.

2380
02:43:39,480 --> 02:43:41,040
I mean, look, you're upset.

2381
02:43:41,040 --> 02:43:46,880
If you're a progressive, we're 10 times more upset cuz they never do anything progressive.

2382
02:43:46,880 --> 02:43:47,880
Never, why?

2383
02:43:47,880 --> 02:43:51,800
Cuz Wall Street and the guys who pay the politicians aren't progressive at all.

2384
02:43:51,800 --> 02:43:53,040
They're massively conservative.

2385
02:43:53,040 --> 02:43:54,680
No, they're selective.

2386
02:43:54,680 --> 02:43:59,040
They selectively enforce it on the general public and then they're exempt from it all.

2387
02:43:59,040 --> 02:44:03,360
So cynical with Bill Gates and all them up there talking about, race taxes, rich people

2388
02:44:03,360 --> 02:44:04,480
don't pay enough.

2389
02:44:04,480 --> 02:44:08,360
Knowing it's all written where they can be tax-free in their tax-free foundations.

2390
02:44:08,360 --> 02:44:09,360
Look-

2391
02:44:09,360 --> 02:44:15,320
Alex, let me ask you a more fundamental question, and I always wonder this about libertarians.

2392
02:44:15,320 --> 02:44:17,240
So how much government do you believe in?

2393
02:44:17,240 --> 02:44:19,040
So I mean, you gotta have some government, right?

2394
02:44:19,040 --> 02:44:21,840
You gotta have police, firemen, teachers, etc.

2395
02:44:21,840 --> 02:44:25,520
So we obviously have to have some taxes to support that government.

2396
02:44:25,520 --> 02:44:28,880
So what do you think is an ideal tax rate and how much government would you want?

2397
02:44:28,880 --> 02:44:32,880
Well, that is a huge discussion, incredibly complex.

2398
02:44:32,880 --> 02:44:36,520
Cuz like Ron Paul stated, we've gotten so domesticated, it'll take 50 years to even

2399
02:44:36,520 --> 02:44:37,960
wean off this.

2400
02:44:37,960 --> 02:44:42,440
But if we don't turn the ship around and start going back at least in a partially different

2401
02:44:42,440 --> 02:44:46,760
direction, we know it's all going bankrupt and gonna collapse and then there'll be nothing,

2402
02:44:46,760 --> 02:44:47,760
Cenk.

2403
02:44:47,760 --> 02:44:50,800
Yeah, but it isn't gonna collapse because of these things.

2404
02:44:50,800 --> 02:44:55,400
The main reason that it's gonna collapse is because we allow the banks to do unlimited

2405
02:44:55,400 --> 02:44:56,400
gambling.

2406
02:44:56,400 --> 02:44:59,200
And unfortunately, they control such a huge percentage of our GDP.

2407
02:44:59,200 --> 02:45:04,840
And then government backs and guarantees it, government then backs and signs us onto it.

2408
02:45:04,840 --> 02:45:07,360
No, look, again, that's our fundamental agreement.

2409
02:45:07,360 --> 02:45:12,600
They've captured the government and JP Morgan alone, and this is in an Atlantic article

2410
02:45:12,600 --> 02:45:18,800
you can read, well, it's public in a range you can see anywhere, trades $74 trillion

2411
02:45:18,800 --> 02:45:19,800
worth of derivatives.

2412
02:45:19,800 --> 02:45:23,040
Now, that doesn't mean they're risking $74 trillion.

2413
02:45:23,040 --> 02:45:26,400
But it does mean that is the number of the amount of trading they're doing.

2414
02:45:26,400 --> 02:45:32,080
So any slight error is gonna lead to enormous uncontrollable losses.

2415
02:45:32,080 --> 02:45:36,080
And any gambler will tell you, if you take enough risks, at some point, you're gonna

2416
02:45:36,080 --> 02:45:37,080
blow it.

2417
02:45:37,080 --> 02:45:39,720
And these guys are definitely going to blow it.

2418
02:45:39,720 --> 02:45:45,560
Your $74 trillion is five times the size of the US economy, and that's just one bank.

2419
02:45:45,560 --> 02:45:50,560
By the way, you know worldwide, it's estimated by the Washington Post to be 1.5 quadrille.

2420
02:45:50,560 --> 02:45:52,600
Yeah, it's insanity.

2421
02:45:52,600 --> 02:45:54,360
So that's gonna blow up.

2422
02:45:54,360 --> 02:45:57,120
It's gonna take the whole world economy down with it.

2423
02:45:57,120 --> 02:46:01,440
What I'm afraid of is that people are gonna take that and then misinterpret what happened

2424
02:46:01,440 --> 02:46:02,440
there.

2425
02:46:02,440 --> 02:46:05,480
And the answer in that case, Alex, isn't less government.

2426
02:46:05,480 --> 02:46:08,640
The answer is more regulation, more honest government.

2427
02:46:08,640 --> 02:46:12,120
Yeah, after the bankers have collapsed and taken everything over, they shut the game

2428
02:46:12,120 --> 02:46:14,800
down so nobody else can even basically do anything.

2429
02:46:14,800 --> 02:46:16,080
See, that's the problem.

2430
02:46:16,080 --> 02:46:17,440
They know this is gonna screw up.

2431
02:46:17,440 --> 02:46:18,680
They signed us onto it.

2432
02:46:18,680 --> 02:46:22,000
Then they implode it, then they pose as saviors, then they bring government in.

2433
02:46:22,000 --> 02:46:26,440
We go from 25 million on food stamps to 50 million to 100 million, and then we're all

2434
02:46:26,440 --> 02:46:30,080
completely domesticated, and the social engineers win.

2435
02:46:30,080 --> 02:46:32,500
Let me shift gears with you.

2436
02:46:32,500 --> 02:46:39,240
General Boykin, former head of Special Forces Command, is in CNS news today talking about

2437
02:46:39,240 --> 02:46:41,520
how there's evidence that our government's arming al-Qaeda.

2438
02:46:41,520 --> 02:46:47,400
Well, come on, that's in the New York Times even, against Libya, in Benghazi, now in Syria.

2439
02:46:47,400 --> 02:46:48,580
They're doing horrible things.

2440
02:46:48,580 --> 02:46:51,220
They're making sure the Arab Spring doesn't become something good.

2441
02:46:51,220 --> 02:46:54,000
They're making sure that Saudi Arabia runs it.

2442
02:46:54,000 --> 02:46:57,300
Where you're from, Turkey, so I know you have knowledge about this, is helping bring them

2443
02:46:57,300 --> 02:46:59,520
in with the US and NATO.

2444
02:46:59,520 --> 02:47:03,780
And I'm not saying Assad's a good guy, but compared to al-Qaeda, he's a wonderful guy.

2445
02:47:03,780 --> 02:47:07,960
And they are killing Christians, they are killing Alawite minority Muslims.

2446
02:47:07,960 --> 02:47:08,960
It is unprecedented.

2447
02:47:08,960 --> 02:47:12,440
Obama, it was called peace bombs when he did Libya.

2448
02:47:12,440 --> 02:47:17,160
I mean, what is your take on where this is going, where the TSA wants to look for bin

2449
02:47:17,160 --> 02:47:24,040
Laden in my underwear, and in my wife's brassiere, and in my daughter's underwear, and my son's

2450
02:47:24,040 --> 02:47:29,900
underwear, but then the government is openly funding and CFR admits those groups are led

2451
02:47:29,900 --> 02:47:30,900
by al-Qaeda.

2452
02:47:30,900 --> 02:47:32,280
I mean, what about that?

2453
02:47:32,280 --> 02:47:34,560
I mean, should we give Obama another peace prize?

2454
02:47:34,560 --> 02:47:37,620
How about 10 more?

2455
02:47:37,620 --> 02:47:39,400
I'm really conflicted on this one.

2456
02:47:39,400 --> 02:47:41,380
I'm not conflicted on this peace prize.

2457
02:47:41,380 --> 02:47:42,380
That was insanity.

2458
02:47:42,380 --> 02:47:46,520
He hadn't even done anything yet, and once he did something, we found out he wasn't altogether

2459
02:47:46,520 --> 02:47:48,920
that interested in peace.

2460
02:47:48,920 --> 02:47:55,200
But look, when I see Qaddafi oppressing and killing and butchering his own people, and

2461
02:47:55,200 --> 02:47:58,600
I see it with Assad, I want to do something about it.

2462
02:47:58,600 --> 02:48:03,220
But doing something is a really hard question.

2463
02:48:03,220 --> 02:48:04,860
What are you supposed to do?

2464
02:48:04,860 --> 02:48:09,800
And I totally understand that the more we get involved, and I think here Ron Paul makes

2465
02:48:09,800 --> 02:48:17,280
a lot of good points, the more blowback we get, and we constantly seem to be funding

2466
02:48:17,280 --> 02:48:19,320
and training the wrong people.

2467
02:48:19,320 --> 02:48:22,160
Look at what happened in Mali.

2468
02:48:22,160 --> 02:48:24,000
We trained some of the guys in Libya.

2469
02:48:24,000 --> 02:48:25,840
They go over to Mali, and then they turn off.

2470
02:48:25,840 --> 02:48:26,840
Oh, it's all an accident.

2471
02:48:26,840 --> 02:48:27,840
Then we got to invade.

2472
02:48:27,840 --> 02:48:31,240
Oh, we got to invade all of Africa with Africa now.

2473
02:48:31,240 --> 02:48:35,360
I said four years ago in Obama deception, they'd use al-Qaeda to invade those very countries

2474
02:48:35,360 --> 02:48:36,360
and do this.

2475
02:48:36,360 --> 02:48:37,360
You know how I knew?

2476
02:48:37,360 --> 02:48:39,000
There's Pentagon public white papers.

2477
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:44,760
They think we're so, see, Cenk, I've got West Point documents from four years ago, and last

2478
02:48:44,760 --> 02:48:48,400
year, and now this year, where they're trying to take on gun owners and take our guns.

2479
02:48:48,400 --> 02:48:53,000
That's why I know, Cenk, they're coming, because I have the army manuals.

2480
02:48:53,000 --> 02:48:54,720
I have the army sources.

2481
02:48:54,720 --> 02:48:58,560
Do you understand what's gonna happen when they come for the guns, bro?

2482
02:48:58,560 --> 02:49:01,720
Okay, I just, I keep going back to it.

2483
02:49:01,720 --> 02:49:04,160
It is totally unnecessary.

2484
02:49:04,160 --> 02:49:08,360
What they would do if they came for guns is they would stir up the biggest S storm you

2485
02:49:08,360 --> 02:49:09,360
ever seen-

2486
02:49:09,360 --> 02:49:10,360
They're trying right now.

2487
02:49:10,360 --> 02:49:11,360
The five star-

2488
02:49:11,360 --> 02:49:14,560
Why would they bother doing that when they've already got the whole system on lockdown?

2489
02:49:14,560 --> 02:49:15,560
I mean-

2490
02:49:15,560 --> 02:49:16,560
They're not.

2491
02:49:16,560 --> 02:49:17,560
No, no, you don't know about the-

2492
02:49:17,560 --> 02:49:19,880
They can't bring a single dollar out of us if they possibly can.

2493
02:49:19,880 --> 02:49:22,400
Mao said political power goes out of the barrel of a gun.

2494
02:49:22,400 --> 02:49:24,480
Our four founders knew that as well.

2495
02:49:24,480 --> 02:49:26,480
They just wanted the people to have the power.

2496
02:49:26,480 --> 02:49:27,640
Don't you get that, man?

2497
02:49:27,640 --> 02:49:28,640
Don't you trust yourself?

2498
02:49:28,640 --> 02:49:33,760
I mean, Alex, think about what kind of, look, you can't do through guns and violence if

2499
02:49:33,760 --> 02:49:35,680
you're gonna fight back against the government.

2500
02:49:35,680 --> 02:49:40,440
You've gotta do it the King way, the Gandhi way, because if you try to outgun them, you

2501
02:49:40,440 --> 02:49:41,440
know what Gandhi said?

2502
02:49:41,440 --> 02:49:45,400
He said, part of the reason we didn't use guns is because we didn't have them.

2503
02:49:45,400 --> 02:49:47,760
Now, you would take that as an example for your side.

2504
02:49:47,760 --> 02:49:52,600
I actually say, well, of course Gandhi was never going to beat the British with weapons.

2505
02:49:52,600 --> 02:49:54,720
They have so many more weapons.

2506
02:49:54,720 --> 02:49:57,440
The way you beat them is by other means.

2507
02:49:57,440 --> 02:50:01,320
And so if you do it democratically, you do it politically, and you get people riled up

2508
02:50:01,320 --> 02:50:02,320
and you say-

2509
02:50:02,320 --> 02:50:04,960
Cenk, Cenk, how much military history have you studied?

2510
02:50:04,960 --> 02:50:09,120
Listen, we couldn't, our entire military couldn't defeat the North Vietnamese cuz they had a

2511
02:50:09,120 --> 02:50:10,120
will to fight.

2512
02:50:10,120 --> 02:50:13,200
The rifleman is the power, okay?

2513
02:50:13,200 --> 02:50:17,560
There are 160 million gun owners plus in this country.

2514
02:50:17,560 --> 02:50:19,920
Alex, you're gonna give them an excuse to kill you, okay?

2515
02:50:19,920 --> 02:50:25,880
I mean, the minute you pick up a gun, they're gonna feel absolutely justified in striking

2516
02:50:25,880 --> 02:50:26,880
back against you everywhere possible.

2517
02:50:26,880 --> 02:50:27,880
Cenk, Cenk, there you go, there you go.

2518
02:50:27,880 --> 02:50:29,400
I'm not picking up a gun.

2519
02:50:29,400 --> 02:50:31,760
I don't wanna have a physical conflict.

2520
02:50:31,760 --> 02:50:36,020
They are preparing to try to confiscate the guns and demonize gun owners as in the Homeland

2521
02:50:36,020 --> 02:50:39,100
Security documents that we broke three and a half years ago.

2522
02:50:39,100 --> 02:50:43,600
They wanna start a civil war and then call us terrorists, and you'll be like, well, they

2523
02:50:43,600 --> 02:50:45,360
killed Ron Paul and Alex Jones.

2524
02:50:45,360 --> 02:50:47,540
They had to, they were gonna lead a revolution.

2525
02:50:47,540 --> 02:50:48,540
See how that spinning works?

2526
02:50:48,540 --> 02:50:51,640
I wanna give you some statistics when we come back.

2527
02:50:51,640 --> 02:50:53,280
I can't wait to have you back on Skype.

2528
02:50:53,280 --> 02:50:55,780
I saw how great your Skype looked before it failed.

2529
02:50:55,780 --> 02:51:01,460
There in your Young Turks studio, theyoungturks.com, I'm Alex Jones.

2530
02:51:01,460 --> 02:51:03,720
It's time for a home security quiz.

2531
02:51:03,720 --> 02:51:04,720
Answer this.

2532
02:51:04,720 --> 02:51:08,920
What effective home security device is smaller than a coffee cup fakes out burglars into

2533
02:51:08,920 --> 02:51:13,500
thinking someone is home at your house while you're away, plugs into any wall outlet, is

2534
02:51:13,500 --> 02:51:17,720
recommended by many police departments, and sells for less than $35?

2535
02:51:17,720 --> 02:51:19,640
Yes, it's fake TV.

2536
02:51:19,640 --> 02:51:24,760
This year, about one in every 50 US homes will have a break-in, with burglars usually

2537
02:51:24,760 --> 02:51:29,220
picking the easy target, a dark house that looks like no one is home.

2538
02:51:29,220 --> 02:51:34,120
Fake TV is a small electronic security device that makes it look like someone is home watching

2539
02:51:34,120 --> 02:51:37,200
TV by simulating the light from a real TV.

2540
02:51:37,200 --> 02:51:40,200
It's like a lamp on a timer, but far more convincing.

2541
02:51:40,200 --> 02:51:44,920
And for only $34.95, fake TV could be the difference between coming home to a secure

2542
02:51:44,920 --> 02:51:47,200
house or one that's been ransacked.

2543
02:51:47,200 --> 02:51:58,360
Go to faketv.com or call 1-877-5FAKETV, that's 877-532-5388, or go to faketv.com.

2544
02:51:58,360 --> 02:52:00,680
Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.

2545
02:52:00,680 --> 02:52:02,240
Hi there.

2546
02:52:02,240 --> 02:52:03,240
My name is Frank Bates.

2547
02:52:03,240 --> 02:52:07,200
What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble.

2548
02:52:07,200 --> 02:52:13,760
I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity

2549
02:52:13,760 --> 02:52:18,480
monopolies and government agencies for what they really are, incompetent line crooks that

2550
02:52:18,480 --> 02:52:23,600
are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high.

2551
02:52:23,600 --> 02:52:25,800
Some have called this a conspiracy.

2552
02:52:25,800 --> 02:52:30,440
Others have called it a cover-up, and you will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy

2553
02:52:30,440 --> 02:52:31,520
goes.

2554
02:52:31,520 --> 02:52:37,160
My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them

2555
02:52:37,160 --> 02:52:39,600
and how you can beat them too.

2556
02:52:39,600 --> 02:52:43,360
Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen

2557
02:52:43,360 --> 02:52:45,080
in the last three months.

2558
02:52:45,080 --> 02:52:50,440
Go to 123coverup.com and discover one weird trick to slash your power bill and protect

2559
02:52:50,440 --> 02:52:51,560
your home.

2560
02:52:51,560 --> 02:52:57,520
So watch my video now at 123coverup.com before they force me to shut it down.

2561
02:52:57,520 --> 02:53:01,520
Again, that's 123coverup.com.

2562
02:53:01,520 --> 02:53:05,060
Digestive health is the key to wellness and elimination of toxins.

2563
02:53:05,060 --> 02:53:06,440
That bears repeating.

2564
02:53:06,440 --> 02:53:09,960
Digestive health is the key to wellness and elimination of toxins.

2565
02:53:09,960 --> 02:53:14,520

2577
02:53:55,200 --> 02:54:12,720
All right, we got him five minutes into the next hour, and he promises after he does his

2578
02:54:12,720 --> 02:54:18,600
big DC trip next month, he'll come back with us in March or so via video Skype.

2579
02:54:18,600 --> 02:54:24,580
This is the last sin that you've ever seen that has ever been revealed.

2580
02:54:24,580 --> 02:54:26,960
He's going to be immediately confirmed.

2581
02:54:26,960 --> 02:54:33,000
You can go to the network on YouTube, you can watch this.

2582
02:54:33,000 --> 02:54:39,120
He's going to be a man in a car, he's going to be a woman in a car, who's going to get

2583
02:54:39,120 --> 02:54:44,660
But I brought Melissa Melton in because she was gonna be on earlier today, but then I ran out of time and Melissa

2584
02:54:44,700 --> 02:54:50,520
We've got FBI statistics from fbi.gov for TV viewers. We're gonna be putting these up on screen for radio listeners

2585
02:54:50,520 --> 02:54:56,560
The video will be posted later today and info wars calm go over these statistics for jink so he can respond

2586
02:54:56,920 --> 02:55:02,820
Well, the situation is that we have a lot of media and politicians that are throwing out statistics and they don't cite their sources

2587
02:55:02,840 --> 02:55:07,720
So we don't know if those are coming from think tanks or special interest groups. This is from the fbi.gov

2588
02:55:07,720 --> 02:55:13,500
They collect this data from 18,000 law enforcement agencies across the country every and private groups have studied

2589
02:55:13,500 --> 02:55:16,740
It's some of the most accurate numbers out there what they're not usually fans of government numbers

2590
02:55:16,740 --> 02:55:18,300
But but this is this is what we have

2591
02:55:18,300 --> 02:55:22,740
It's the most consistent over the years and using basic calculations for percentages

2592
02:55:22,740 --> 02:55:26,020
You can see by that their own data that goes back to 1992

2593
02:55:26,240 --> 02:55:32,080
the uniform crime report shows violent crime has been cut in half since 1992 and if you take the

2594
02:55:32,080 --> 02:55:38,200
1992 violent crime rate per 100,000 people of seven five seven point seven you subtract the 2011 violent crime rate of

2595
02:55:38,440 --> 02:55:45,080
386 point three you get three seventy one point four if you divide this by the original 1992 rate you get point four nine

2596
02:55:45,080 --> 02:55:51,800
Oh two multiply that out and you're gonna have a decrease right there of forty nine point zero two percent in violent crime between

2597
02:55:52,120 --> 02:55:58,400
1992 and 2011 and the murder rate shows the same decrease as well. Actually we can go to that

2598
02:55:58,400 --> 02:56:02,160
So people think it's the end of the world and everybody's dying

2599
02:56:02,600 --> 02:56:08,440
But the truth is the only thing going up is mass school shootings and that's 88 a year about half of those gangbangers killing each

2600
02:56:08,440 --> 02:56:14,080
Other it's still a bad thing. But I mean Biden going riddled with holes beautiful children. I mean, it's so exploitive

2601
02:56:14,080 --> 02:56:18,020
We're gonna go to more numbers here in a moment. Hit pause on that but jink rubbing respond

2602
02:56:18,020 --> 02:56:23,920
I mean almost a 50% cut as more guns get bought as the criminals get scared in the last 20 years

2603
02:56:23,920 --> 02:56:29,880
So Alex, there's about 12 different possibilities as to why the crime rate started going down in the early 1990s

2604
02:56:29,880 --> 02:56:34,080
I wrote a I should say I read a brilliant article in Mother Jones about this

2605
02:56:34,280 --> 02:56:39,700
And we have the Kevin drum on the show to talk about it and I was really skeptical about it

2606
02:56:39,840 --> 02:56:46,460
But it turns out the one thing that correlates with crime increases and decrease is lead

2607
02:56:46,640 --> 02:56:51,920
Okay, and so the leaded gasoline really screwed this country up in a big big way now

2608
02:56:51,920 --> 02:56:56,400
To me I get that the crime rate is going down and that's terrific thing

2609
02:56:56,400 --> 02:57:00,040
And again, there's a lot of is that why we all beat the hell out of each other in the 80s

2610
02:57:03,920 --> 02:57:05,920
Anyway, I'm sorry. Go ahead

2611
02:57:06,440 --> 02:57:07,640
but

2612
02:57:07,640 --> 02:57:09,800
the problem with with the guns isn't

2613
02:57:10,640 --> 02:57:15,800
necessarily the crime rate as much as it is gun homicides and of course these massacres and then you know

2614
02:57:15,800 --> 02:57:19,880
You look at the international rates and you know, you've got Japan you've got

2615
02:57:19,880 --> 02:57:27,280
Australia and you know, they've passed the their ban in Australia in 96. They haven't had a single massacre since in Japan

2616
02:57:27,280 --> 02:57:33,960
Oh, yeah, now they're trying to take the bolt-action guns now there. Okay. Let me throw this at you long after leaded gas was out

2617
02:57:33,960 --> 02:57:39,140
They did concealed carry and that's when the real drop started. So it's not the lead. That's a small part. I agree

2618
02:57:39,140 --> 02:57:43,200
I've seen the studies. That's a small part from the complete rage of the 70s and 80s

2619
02:57:43,540 --> 02:57:47,400
Okay, but but in the 90s, it's concealed carry more guns less crime

2620
02:57:47,400 --> 02:57:52,560
You can use Japan where nobody robs each other when there's a tsunami and say look they have lower crime

2621
02:57:52,560 --> 02:57:55,420
I mean, it's just it's a different culture is my point

2622
02:57:56,360 --> 02:58:02,120
Look at Japan for one second. They they have in the ballpark of two to ten gun homicides

2623
02:58:02,880 --> 02:58:09,880
Over the last six years or so. Okay per year, which is and and Japan is a smaller country than us, but

2624
02:58:10,400 --> 02:58:14,440
They're significantly large and if a samurai told a villager to get on their knees

2625
02:58:14,440 --> 02:58:18,040
Because they had disrespected him and to let them cut their head off

2626
02:58:18,040 --> 02:58:22,680
They would not resist that has been a programming and the culture of feudal Japan

2627
02:58:22,680 --> 02:58:26,980
They're great smart people, but that's leftovers of that the total submission

2628
02:58:27,760 --> 02:58:30,260
And and and they don't have guns Alex

2629
02:58:32,040 --> 02:58:38,080
But they got guys that go in schools and stab people with knives the government wants the guns to enslave us stay there back in

2630
02:58:38,080 --> 02:58:40,080

2644
03:00:05,600 --> 03:00:07,280
Big brother

2645
03:00:07,280 --> 03:00:09,000
mainstream media

2646
03:00:09,000 --> 03:00:11,480
Government cover-ups you want answers

2647
03:00:12,000 --> 03:00:17,520
Well, so does he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network

2648
03:00:17,520 --> 03:00:21,920
And now live from Austin Texas alex jones

2649
03:00:22,520 --> 03:00:29,300
All right, it is our final little segment with jake huger of the young Turks calm to the kid radio TV host

2650
03:00:29,560 --> 03:00:31,560
And star of YouTube with their news

2651
03:00:32,080 --> 03:00:38,080
Pretty entertaining, but I don't agree with a lot of it. I mean, I'll say that up front because oh, it's an accident

2652
03:00:38,080 --> 03:00:40,080
Oh, it's corrupt. Oh, whatever

2653
03:00:40,120 --> 03:00:47,200
But at least the guy is not one of these Skeletor demons like the mainline Democrats are that I've met behind the scenes

2654
03:00:47,200 --> 03:00:52,360
I mean, at least you'll admit that it's wrong that Obama. I mean, did you think that was sneaky how he said don't worry?

2655
03:00:52,360 --> 03:00:53,200
I'm gonna veto

2656
03:00:53,200 --> 03:00:58,680
NDAA so you don't have to fight it and then he blamed the Senate so they released the letters where his lawyers wrote it

2657
03:00:58,680 --> 03:01:02,000
And Obama demanded it then he said don't worry. I won't sign it and he did

2658
03:01:02,000 --> 03:01:08,400
I mean, it's the way Obama gets you to feel good when he walks you out behind the barn and slits your throat

2659
03:01:08,400 --> 03:01:10,400
I mean, it's it's really creepy

2660
03:01:10,400 --> 03:01:16,960
It is a great show or there was on stars called boss Kelsey Grammer was the star

2661
03:01:16,960 --> 03:01:19,880
But I don't agree with Kelsey's politics, but damn he's brilliant

2662
03:01:19,880 --> 03:01:24,120
I thought he was the best actor on TV and there's a great line in there about politics

2663
03:01:24,120 --> 03:01:30,000
They say the donors say we want change on the outside and continuity on the inside

2664
03:01:30,000 --> 03:01:33,120
And that right there is Obama in a nutshell

2665
03:01:33,120 --> 03:01:37,280
He sells you change and then he just keeps the machine rolling

2666
03:01:37,280 --> 03:01:43,360
We give kind of wrestling nicknames to people sometimes Obama's nickname is the establishment

2667
03:01:43,960 --> 03:01:50,320
and God, he does a brilliant job of pretending he's given you historic change while he

2668
03:01:51,560 --> 03:01:57,840
Ups the ante honestly on the police state and the warrantless wiretapping and the NDAA. I don't know why he does it

2669
03:01:57,840 --> 03:02:00,780
I mean, you know, I'm not a psychologist, but I do know he does do it

2670
03:02:01,160 --> 03:02:03,520
Well, he's bought and paid for by the very same interest

2671
03:02:03,520 --> 03:02:08,080
I mean we already went over that but I would just ask you to do this because I know you care about the children

2672
03:02:09,160 --> 03:02:13,920
The vaccines in most cases like flu do not protect you from what it does on the insert

2673
03:02:13,920 --> 03:02:15,920
It says it can kill you give you narcolepsy

2674
03:02:16,320 --> 03:02:18,960
you name it and all over the world with the

2675
03:02:19,840 --> 03:02:25,440
Meningitis and and other shots they're giving kids polio shots. It's killing them. I've got articles up at info wars calm right now

2676
03:02:25,440 --> 03:02:30,520
Well, if I send you the actual studies and reports about vaccines killing kids

2677
03:02:30,520 --> 03:02:34,840
Well, will the young Turks cover that or would you get kicked off the Al Jazeera TV?

2678
03:02:36,500 --> 03:02:39,000
Well right now we don't have any deal with Al Jazeera

2679
03:02:39,000 --> 03:02:44,800
I mean, I'm continuing on my old contract and I'm I've never been worried about getting kicked off of anything as you might know

2680
03:02:45,280 --> 03:02:48,560
But but on the police, so will I read it? Of course. Will I cover it?

2681
03:02:48,560 --> 03:02:52,440
I don't know. It depends on what's in it because you know, look, I don't know anything about it

2682
03:02:52,440 --> 03:02:57,880
I'm not an expert on it, but every single doctor I know says that they believe in the vaccines

2683
03:02:57,880 --> 03:03:01,440
They think a polio vaccine is enormously important before they've been brainwashed

2684
03:03:01,440 --> 03:03:05,240
They've been brainwashed by it and they're told to do that by the medical companies

2685
03:03:05,240 --> 03:03:10,520
They work for I have to know doctors that are pushed and given kickbacks for how many people they give shots

2686
03:03:10,520 --> 03:03:15,040
Well in closing tell us about young Turks calm and now what you guys are going to be covering tonight

2687
03:03:16,080 --> 03:03:22,260
So, you know, we do our live show 9 o'clock to 11 o'clock Eastern on the young Turks calm

2688
03:03:22,260 --> 03:03:24,260
You could also see it on youtube.com

2689
03:03:24,260 --> 03:03:29,500
Slash TYT and especially on youtube.com slash TYT. You got all the clips

2690
03:03:29,660 --> 03:03:34,180
so if you like a story about guns or you like a story about the NDAA you will

2691
03:03:34,220 --> 03:03:40,700
Be able to watch that in about five minutes and not necessarily have to watch the whole show and we do all the news

2692
03:03:40,700 --> 03:03:44,420
So we got pop culture. We got policy really really serious

2693
03:03:44,940 --> 03:03:46,940
politics foreign policy and

2694
03:03:47,340 --> 03:03:51,060
We and then we've got a network of about 20 channels on YouTube as well

2695
03:03:51,060 --> 03:03:56,580
So you can watch sports or any of the other topics that you like. So youtube.com slash TYT

2696
03:03:56,580 --> 03:04:02,940
Yeah, you certainly pioneered things Glenn Beck's trying to copy what I've done, but also what you've done in closing

2697
03:04:02,940 --> 03:04:07,180
Look, I know the New World Order is real. I've studied what they plan. It's a eugenics program

2698
03:04:07,180 --> 03:04:08,860
Just like injecting black people with syphilis

2699
03:04:08,860 --> 03:04:14,300
That's the tip of the iceberg and I'm telling you they're evil if you care about your children you have children, right?

2700
03:04:14,540 --> 03:04:19,160
Yep, if you care about your children the GMO the top companies are on record

2701
03:04:19,160 --> 03:04:24,980
It's designed to sterilize you if you care about your kids look into the vaccines if you care about what's happening

2702
03:04:24,980 --> 03:04:26,900
I'm telling you. This is not my opinion

2703
03:04:26,900 --> 03:04:32,020
The reason I get so upset jink is because I know this stuff's real and I think you might have a heart and a soul

2704
03:04:32,300 --> 03:04:35,660
So I'm asking you don't sell out to the New World Order

2705
03:04:35,660 --> 03:04:39,860
You've shown you left MSNBC because you were against the war and stuff and the things they're doing

2706
03:04:40,420 --> 03:04:46,240
Go all the way. You don't need the system come out against the New World Order. I'm telling you look into what I've covered

2707
03:04:46,240 --> 03:04:49,240
It's real

2708
03:04:50,000 --> 03:04:55,120
So far I disagree with you on that Alex, but I'm always open to reading things all right jink

2709
03:04:55,120 --> 03:04:57,240
I'll say bye to you during the break. Thank you for spending so much time us

2710
03:04:57,240 --> 03:05:00,000
We're gonna come back with a special report more on those statistics on the guns

2711
03:05:01,360 --> 03:05:09,600
Hello, I'm Alex Jones myself my family the info wars dot-com team want to relay to you and your families that we are

2712
03:05:09,600 --> 03:05:17,520

2713
03:05:17,840 --> 03:05:24,560
But we can't do that without your help by getting the films bumper stickers and t-shirts and info wars

Operation as we move to the next level we need your help to spread the word like never before

2716
03:05:34,960 --> 03:05:40,920
They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness

2717
03:05:41,520 --> 03:05:48,120
You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics

2718
03:05:48,640 --> 03:05:50,640
dehumanization and ultimate

2719
03:05:50,800 --> 03:05:55,920
Extermination the war is here. It's an info war the spirit of

2720
03:05:57,000 --> 03:05:59,480
1776 versus the mindset of

2721
03:05:59,480 --> 03:06:04,560
1984 my name is Stephen Huir after 22 years of nutritional counseling

2722
03:06:04,560 --> 03:06:09,760
I've observed that most brain malfunctions have at their roots some form of toxicity and brain damage

2723
03:06:09,760 --> 03:06:15,280
So whether it is poor memory or focus lack of creative thinking or more serious matters like inability to focus

2724
03:06:15,480 --> 03:06:21,360
Speak normally or remember things the emphasis to getting one's brain working optimally needs to be on detoxification

2725
03:06:21,520 --> 03:06:26,800
One world way support your body's number one means of detoxification, which is glutathione production

2726
03:06:26,800 --> 03:06:31,640
My name is Angie and my son has suffered from borderline autism and constipation

2727
03:06:31,640 --> 03:06:37,120
I got him on one world way and in two months his constipation is gone. He's become friendlier

2728
03:06:37,120 --> 03:06:41,200
He can carry on a normal conversation with me and he has made his first friend

2729
03:06:41,360 --> 03:06:45,400
He's doing great and he looks forward to taking one real way every day

2730
03:06:45,400 --> 03:06:52,400
You could offer him a present or cake and he would prefer the one real way go to one world way calm

2731

That's one world WH e y.com or call eight eight eight nine eight eight three three two five

2733
03:07:04,240 --> 03:07:08,360
Step outside the box. I want you to know some very important information in

2734
03:07:09,160 --> 03:07:13,720
1985 president Ronald Reagan requested that carnivore be sent directly to the White House

2735
03:07:14,000 --> 03:07:18,120
At a time when only the president could obtain this world-class healer now

2736
03:07:18,120 --> 03:07:22,720
Twenty seven years later carnivore capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy

2737
03:07:23,120 --> 03:07:27,880
Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17

2738
03:07:28,200 --> 03:07:35,600
Naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell if you want to stay healthy

2739
03:07:35,920 --> 03:07:41,820
Now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body

2740
03:07:42,240 --> 03:07:46,720
Call one eight six six Venus fly or order from carnivore calm

2743
03:07:59,980 --> 03:08:16,300
He's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network

2744
03:08:16,300 --> 03:08:21,460
All right, if you just joined us from the last hour we had Jake Uyghur of the Young Turks on

2745
03:08:21,980 --> 03:08:27,120
And I don't think he's an evil person a bad person at heart like appears Morgan

2746
03:08:28,100 --> 03:08:29,320
but

2747
03:08:29,320 --> 03:08:35,260
he just makes excuses after the excuses after excuses and I was talking to Melissa Melton during the break and

2748
03:08:36,020 --> 03:08:41,140
We were talking about how everybody's getting these allergies and they're getting worse and worse people that never had them are getting them to like

2749
03:08:41,380 --> 03:08:47,820
Normal foods even stuff that isn't GMO and it's because we're being biologically manipulated and I have

2750
03:08:48,520 --> 03:08:54,880
More than a hundred eugenics books written by the top scientists the heads of IBM the the White House science are

2751
03:08:54,880 --> 03:08:59,280
How they would engineer this in the 30s 40s 50s 60s 70s 80s 90s

2752
03:08:59,840 --> 03:09:04,040
We're gonna do some gun statistics here as we go into the fourth hour of overdrive with Melissa Melton

2753
03:09:04,360 --> 03:09:07,640
But you were telling me a story and I said, well, can you tell that story on air?

2754
03:09:07,640 --> 03:09:13,520
And you said yes, you would you had to take your son to the emergency room last night and I'm telling Jake

2755
03:09:13,520 --> 03:09:15,520
I'm going listen. Don't give your kids vaccines

2756
03:09:15,520 --> 03:09:19,600
I'd like to send you the inserts and and listen this GMO was really designed and he's like

2757
03:09:19,600 --> 03:09:23,960
I don't believe they want to do that to me. I'm like, what about black men and syphilis? What about the atomic soldiers?

2758
03:09:23,960 --> 03:09:26,960
They're just not listening. Okay, there's a global scientific

2759
03:09:27,840 --> 03:09:29,840
Dictatorship, it's a plan and

2760
03:09:30,480 --> 03:09:34,080
99% of people are not in on it. It's a very small technocratic group

2761
03:09:34,080 --> 03:09:38,080
But just like they have the times of London Bill Gates Oprah Winfrey

2762
03:09:38,680 --> 03:09:42,760
Warren Buffett Soros about 30 of them met at

2763
03:09:43,000 --> 03:09:49,920
Rockefeller University quote secret meeting to discuss global government to reduce our population that it's always the same

2764
03:09:49,920 --> 03:09:55,360
I mean when I say I've read a hundred books, okay, I'm not exaggerating a hundred books

2765
03:09:55,360 --> 03:10:01,080
They've read it's more than a hundred where they admit their global government plan where they admit they're killing us

2766
03:10:02,040 --> 03:10:06,840
cancer is I mean that that Miss America contestants having both her breasts removed and

2767
03:10:08,720 --> 03:10:13,840
She's wondering why her mother and all her family's dying of breast cancer. Why is breast cancer up 3,000 something percent?

2768
03:10:13,840 --> 03:10:18,560
Why is the u.s. Leading it worldwide in the increase? There's never discussion. Why is it exploding?

2769
03:10:18,560 --> 03:10:22,760
Why is it exploding? Why are all these other autism all these other cancers?

2770
03:10:22,880 --> 03:10:28,880
Why why why why why why why but you give your kid a vaccine they have a convulsion right there now the doctors are taught

2771
03:10:28,880 --> 03:10:33,440
This is in the news to say that's normal to have a convulsion really and your two-year-old never talks again

2772
03:10:34,280 --> 03:10:39,320
Now and again, it's around 18 months to two years when they all build up the 50-something vaccines now

2773
03:10:39,320 --> 03:10:42,560
it's gonna be a hundred and then 200 they're talking about by age two and

2774
03:10:43,400 --> 03:10:46,280
Yeah, let's turn her mic on go ahead and say what you said again

2775
03:10:46,280 --> 03:10:50,400
Oh, the u.s. Has the most aggressive vaccine schedule in the world. It's unprecedented

2776
03:10:50,520 --> 03:10:56,080
We have so many vaccines that are given and it is amazing. I think it's like 69 by 18

2777
03:10:56,320 --> 03:10:58,320
You're supposed to take now 50 something by two

2778
03:10:58,480 --> 03:10:58,960
Yeah

2779
03:10:58,960 --> 03:11:00,120
It just keeps going up

2780
03:11:00,120 --> 03:11:03,520
So and they just keep adding more and Bill Gates is funding putting it in the food

2781
03:11:03,760 --> 03:11:10,160
Pears and bananas where you you're gonna take and mosquitoes that come bite you you don't have a choice Bill Gates says he even has

2782
03:11:10,160 --> 03:11:14,760
A clothing thing now that's gonna have nanotech in it. That's gonna dispense medication. Oh, that doesn't sound like it's dangerous

2783
03:11:14,760 --> 03:11:20,760
Yeah, that sounds great. No, everything's fine. There's not a plan. You know, the globalists just took over and are launching drones

2784
03:11:20,760 --> 03:11:27,240
They admit humans won't even be in the equation soon. Only the elite let's build giant robot armies for eugenics-based elite

2785
03:11:27,240 --> 03:11:30,900
That sounds wonderful. Yes, and then we'll all wear their Medicaid tell folks what happened to your son

2786
03:11:31,160 --> 03:11:36,040
My ex decided to take him to a well-known fast-food restaurant and get him say the name Burger King

2787
03:11:36,040 --> 03:11:41,400
It was Burger King and get him some onion rings and within probably 20 minutes of eating these onion rings his whole body just

2788
03:11:41,400 --> 03:11:48,200
welled up with huge rashes and blisters and he had to go to the emergency room because his eyes were swelling shut a

2789
03:11:49,360 --> 03:11:55,920
Couple years ago, we'd be on a road trip and you know now we always pack all our food period period and find out

2790
03:11:55,920 --> 03:11:57,920
We're you know, at least semi-organic

2791
03:11:58,400 --> 03:12:01,280
Store is somewhere around there or we pack it all on a road trip

2792
03:12:01,960 --> 03:12:04,580
Because every time I give in all right

2793
03:12:04,580 --> 03:12:08,800
I guess we'll pull into one of the big names my children get sick and act like demons

2794
03:12:08,800 --> 03:12:13,480
Mm-hmm. And the thing is it's been shown to be addictive because McDonald's and others by law

2795
03:12:13,480 --> 03:12:18,960
They call it an additive. It has silicone and a lot of the frying agents says I mean silicone silicone

2796
03:12:18,960 --> 03:12:24,320
And then high fructose corn syrup and everything too and it's just the whole combination of all those chemicals all at once hitting a small

2797
03:12:24,320 --> 03:12:29,760
Child, it's just amazing. But yeah, I've never I mean even when we've ever gone there

2798
03:12:29,760 --> 03:12:30,520
I mean we eat it

2799
03:12:30,520 --> 03:12:32,440
We always feel crappy like you said

2800
03:12:32,440 --> 03:12:36,920
But this is the first time this has ever happened and I we will not be eating there ever again

2801
03:12:36,920 --> 03:12:40,860
I mean it was scary. It really scared me. They thought his throat might swell shut

2802
03:12:40,860 --> 03:12:43,960
They had to give him two medications and the hospital said it was an allergic reaction

2803
03:12:43,960 --> 03:12:49,120
It was an allergic reaction and that was the only thing that he'd ingested or any and again 20 years ago

2804
03:12:49,120 --> 03:12:53,520
There might have been one or two food allergies. Now. It's hundreds of things eat a mango die

2805
03:12:54,240 --> 03:12:58,000
One in five Americans are allergic to wheat. They have wheat gluten issues now

2806
03:12:58,320 --> 03:13:03,760
And again didn't used to be the case my grandmother almost nine never had allergies has horrible ones always lived here

2807
03:13:03,760 --> 03:13:07,720
It's everybody I know I mean listen, I've been exercising

2808
03:13:07,800 --> 03:13:12,000
I've been eating almost no GMO really working hard to do this up when I'm on the road then it's hard

2809
03:13:12,000 --> 03:13:12,960
It's a habit

2810
03:13:12,960 --> 03:13:17,480
I have been swimming two miles a day back when I could still go swimming for it was too cold

2811
03:13:17,880 --> 03:13:21,360
Jogging hiking climbing mountains my muscles get bigger and stuff

2812
03:13:21,360 --> 03:13:27,480
But I've got allergies now to cedar where I may have to leave in the winter and go remote do the show from another city

2813
03:13:27,480 --> 03:13:31,280
I mean, I'm actually looking at it and nothing will get rid of it. I just gnashed my teeth together

2814
03:13:31,280 --> 03:13:35,800
I'm so angry about it so bad. I mean I mean this whole thing is out of control Melissa

2815
03:13:35,960 --> 03:13:38,480
Well, and then when you go you have all these random symptoms

2816
03:13:38,480 --> 03:13:43,120
And they want to give you more and more medications and tell you you have more and more disorders and not tell you what it

2817
03:13:43,120 --> 03:13:44,480
actually is

2818
03:13:44,480 --> 03:13:47,000
Well, I mean the doctors don't know they're not specialists

2819
03:13:47,000 --> 03:13:52,600
But the endocrinologist the allergist the the the the scientists that study the brain blood barrier

2820
03:13:52,960 --> 03:13:56,000
Dr. Blaylock all of them will tell you this stuff is killing us

2821
03:13:56,000 --> 03:13:59,560
I mean listen take all the different BT varieties of corn and stuff

2822
03:13:59,560 --> 03:14:04,720
There's a bunch of companies put it out on just Monsanto it all is designed where when bugs eat it they die

2823
03:14:04,720 --> 03:14:08,360
They die, but they say but it's safe for you to excuse me, and they go well. It's natural

2824
03:14:08,360 --> 03:14:12,740
They took a fungus or in one case of bacteria and soup it up thousands of times

2825
03:14:13,520 --> 03:14:20,000
The the poisonous bacteria or fungus and then it's two different varieties, and then we're supposed to eat that everything's fine

2826
03:14:20,000 --> 03:14:24,440
Don't matter all the bowel diseases are exploding does it matter your IQs are dropping doesn't matter

2827
03:14:24,440 --> 03:14:28,800
You're getting cancer doesn't matter of the studies that killed all the monkeys and rats everything's fine, Melissa

2828
03:14:28,800 --> 03:14:32,160
Everything's okay tune into the Young Turks man the government loves us

2829
03:14:32,160 --> 03:14:37,440
Yeah, why wouldn't you want to eat a food that produces its own pesticide that sounds great. That's healthy for everyone

2830
03:14:37,440 --> 03:14:44,080
I actually read one of the people from the American Academy of Pediatrics said that there's no long-term study to show that eating less

2831
03:14:44,160 --> 03:14:45,600
Pesticide is healthier for you

2832
03:14:45,600 --> 03:14:48,880
So if there's no long-term study to tell you that it's bad for you

2833
03:14:48,880 --> 03:14:51,800
Then that means it must be good for them, and they don't do the human studies

2834
03:14:51,800 --> 03:14:58,840
But then they do the monkeys the guinea pigs the rats the mice within three generations with with multiple new

2835
03:14:59,840 --> 03:15:05,980
GMO potatoes you name it the rats are almost all sterile or mentally retarded or dead or have giant cancers or no

2836
03:15:05,980 --> 03:15:10,460
Genitals or genitals on their head. I mean it is stuff you can't it isn't and it's all

2837
03:15:11,040 --> 03:15:15,240
All these companies Monsanto on the board of McDonald's tied into Bill and Melinda Gates

2838
03:15:15,400 --> 03:15:16,800
Bill Gates bought into Monsanto

2839
03:15:16,800 --> 03:15:22,600
And then you go track the founders and the heads all eugenicist all going and giving speeches how they want to kill us

2840
03:15:23,160 --> 03:15:25,040
Exactly Bill Gates gets up at TED TV

2841
03:15:25,040 --> 03:15:31,600
We've got to lower this h2o equation from the humans down to zero that means zero this shows zero humans and the whole crowd laughs

2842
03:15:31,600 --> 03:15:33,600
and gets off

2843
03:15:36,360 --> 03:15:40,100
Knowing they're in on the joke that thrills them as little control freaks

2844
03:15:40,280 --> 03:15:45,160
Because they don't like going to the Grand Canyon and seeing you see zero right there on screen

2845
03:15:45,160 --> 03:15:47,160
Now the numbers up to 80

2846
03:15:47,900 --> 03:15:53,980
European children develop narcolepsy of receiving h1n1 vaccine, and then you go back boom Bill Gates

2847
03:15:53,980 --> 03:15:59,940
It was 60 something thousand India got sterilized 50 African children paralyzed after receiving Bill Gates

2848
03:16:00,460 --> 03:16:04,140
Back to meningitis vaccine. Oh, but everything's fine

2849
03:16:04,620 --> 03:16:09,180
Everything's good isn't that just precious Melissa. Yeah, when you look into his foundation

2850
03:16:09,180 --> 03:16:15,460
They own stock in all the companies Monsanto McDonald's Burger King big he owned and then he owns stock in the pioneering companies who treat

2851
03:16:15,540 --> 03:16:18,740
Autism and treat gut disorders, so they hit it on both sides

2852
03:16:19,060 --> 03:16:24,020
They're gonna suck the money out of you while you're debilitated and tortured so they don't want to just kill you

2853
03:16:24,060 --> 03:16:27,660
It's important to watch humanity mutate and die and be in pain

2854
03:16:28,060 --> 03:16:31,820
Because I mean that's why Joe Biden talks about those beautiful children riddled with holes

2855
03:16:33,180 --> 03:16:38,060
Have you seen that where he's like obviously getting off on it. I mean anyone can look and go perv

2856
03:16:38,060 --> 03:16:43,100
Perv perv. I saw him in a park. I would creep away from him. Yeah

2857
03:16:43,100 --> 03:16:44,860
I wouldn't want to go down a dark alley with that guy

2858
03:16:44,860 --> 03:16:48,740
I haven't seen that particular clip, but I can barely watch it. I mean it's so hard to even see you guys

2859
03:16:48,740 --> 03:16:50,740
Have the Joe Biden I sent you

2860
03:16:51,300 --> 03:16:53,540
Cue it up. This is just part of it all right

2861
03:16:53,540 --> 03:16:56,660
And we're gonna go to break and cover the statistics in the five minutes after that

2862
03:16:56,820 --> 03:17:02,860
You know we were giving those statistics most the drop was not in the 80s. No. It's consistently over the last 20 years

2863
03:17:03,060 --> 03:17:07,460
Yeah, and I phased the lead out starting like 180 to 86 or so the lead study

2864
03:17:07,460 --> 03:17:09,340
Yeah, but that can't be accounted for it

2865
03:17:09,340 --> 03:17:14,940
Just continually dropping for the last it accelerated the last nine with the proliferation of concealed carry

2866
03:17:14,940 --> 03:17:18,180
And they have the local we took stats in college

2867
03:17:18,540 --> 03:17:23,740
Yeah, I mean to say that that's all it is is just I think there's no way you can do that when you look at

2868
03:17:23,740 --> 03:17:25,780
The whole big picture of all of well they can't stand it

2869
03:17:25,780 --> 03:17:28,420
They're like look at the children like Stalin said one person dies

2870
03:17:28,420 --> 03:17:33,420
It's a tragedy a million die or 10,000 die different quote its statistics

2871
03:17:33,420 --> 03:17:38,900
They know that I mean they got drones murdering blowing kids lower mandibles off hell-raiser type stuff

2872
03:17:38,900 --> 03:17:43,420
It's all cute and funny, but then all the children give us your guns. It's for the Obama

2873
03:17:43,420 --> 03:17:49,100
I'll get the guns for you the little kid high-five me. I mean the exploitiveness of it well

2874
03:17:49,100 --> 03:17:53,260
He's killing hundreds of kids in other countries. That's fine. No one cares about that. We have the perv Club

2875
03:17:54,980 --> 03:17:57,440
Okay play the perv here's the pervert different meetings

2876
03:17:57,440 --> 03:18:03,480
There is nothing that has gone to the heart of the matter more than

2877
03:18:03,920 --> 03:18:07,840
The visual image people have a little curve next to his riddle

2878
03:18:08,720 --> 03:18:10,760
Not shot in the street

2879
03:18:12,840 --> 03:18:18,760
Riddle and one of the guys in that meeting son planned a mass shooting the local cops stopped see how this works

2880
03:18:18,760 --> 03:18:25,280
It's like he's salivating over the word riddle. He don't know he has that look

2881
03:18:33,520 --> 03:18:37,680
We're gonna riddle you once we get him that's the kind of person you got cranking back up

2882
03:18:37,680 --> 03:18:40,640
Have you heard all the clips of piers morgan? I'm not killing Babel. Yes

2883
03:18:40,640 --> 03:18:46,600
I mean riddle riddle riddle kids riddle riddle

2884
03:18:49,280 --> 03:18:53,640
That's the kind of person you get up on if you're sitting next to on a bus and look at the guy next to it

2885
03:18:53,640 --> 03:18:59,360
These are government control freak pervs my pervs. They want to pervert liberty look at that pervs smacking his lips

2886
03:18:59,920 --> 03:19:01,920
next to him

2887
03:19:01,920 --> 03:19:09,680
With that guy Melissa, oh god, I'm so sick of these people that guy it's like it's like general boy gets scared of him

2888
03:19:09,680 --> 03:19:13,000
I don't I'm just way past it. You guys don't control me. I don't care what you do

2889
03:19:13,000 --> 03:19:15,160
I'm gonna make sure you go down with me. How's that sound?

2890
03:19:16,400 --> 03:19:20,000
All right, that's enough of pervo. All right, we're gonna mean is it fine

2891
03:19:21,000 --> 03:19:25,920
Did you see him during the speech with Obama last week the salivating and the he kept fighting the small going?

2892
03:19:25,920 --> 03:19:27,920
I

2893
03:19:30,600 --> 03:19:34,280
Gotta feed the trolls here on here when I do these little pieces they take it out of context

2894
03:19:34,760 --> 03:19:37,860
They've got it clipped together and dubbed my voice saying racist stuff, too

2895
03:19:37,860 --> 03:19:42,300
Oh wonderful, but it doesn't all it does is just credit them. Basically. It's a good way to spend your time

2896
03:19:42,720 --> 03:19:46,240
Hey good for them. Yeah, they're gonna die cancer early, too

2897
03:19:46,240 --> 03:19:51,560
They probably when they beg retching their guts out about to take the all express elevator straight to hell

2898
03:19:51,560 --> 03:19:56,320
where the devil and all his angels are waiting to roll with your soul like a

2899
03:19:56,520 --> 03:20:00,040
Millstone and take you right to the center of the frozen lake in the Ninth Circle

2900
03:20:00,440 --> 03:20:06,120
Gun statistics if you've ever wanted one of our best-selling generators, but we're waiting for an offer so crazy

2901
03:20:06,120 --> 03:20:09,920
You couldn't refuse then you're not gonna want to miss this exciting message

2902
03:20:09,920 --> 03:20:17,120
Here's why our solar generators provide life-saving electrical power and unlike gas generators solar generators run quietly

2903
03:20:17,120 --> 03:20:24,480
Amid no fumes and produce electricity from the Sun. So when the lights go out, you'll always have the power you need now

2904
03:20:24,480 --> 03:20:30,320
Here's the best part every year. We accumulate a few solar generators that we just can't sell as new

2905
03:20:30,320 --> 03:20:36,360

Now I want to go over these gun statistics with Melissa Melton here from FBI.gov I've talked a lot about these

2946
03:24:10,440 --> 03:24:12,440
I just looked at some of the statistics

2947
03:24:12,760 --> 03:24:15,160
21% drop in violent crime the last seven years

2948
03:24:16,160 --> 03:24:20,720
And then I saw Fox say 49, but they didn't give the actual proof. I went looked it up

2949
03:24:20,720 --> 03:24:22,720
They were being accurate 49 plus

2950
03:24:23,440 --> 03:24:31,200
Percent since 1991 Melissa Melton's here to cover that that'll hit a few of the headlines up at info wars.com for TV viewers

2951
03:24:31,200 --> 03:24:33,200
We're putting graphics up

2952
03:24:33,560 --> 03:24:37,080
Showing from FBI.gov and then we break down the numbers and again

2953
03:24:37,080 --> 03:24:39,200
This is what you went to college for along with journalism

2954
03:24:39,200 --> 03:24:42,240
So you've been helping us crack these numbers, but anybody can go check them for themselves

2955
03:24:42,240 --> 03:24:45,120
And then some will say I thought you don't like government numbers

2956
03:24:45,120 --> 03:24:48,620
We know which ones are fake from economists and others like the unemployment numbers

2957
03:24:48,620 --> 03:24:53,460
Or numbers on inflation they used to be accurate 20 years ago, and they've gotten worse and worse

2958
03:24:53,460 --> 03:24:58,580
So we know how they cook them the crime statistics are very accurate as they're compiled locally

2959
03:24:58,580 --> 03:25:02,460
And then they're cross referenced by a lot of different universities and others

2960
03:25:02,460 --> 03:25:07,180
But the uniform crime statistics go over these for people well these statistics come from

2961
03:25:07,820 --> 03:25:12,600
18,000 law enforcement agencies across the whole country and you're talking City College County State

2962
03:25:12,600 --> 03:25:20,560
Tribal federal agencies all over so 18,000 they compile this data every single year, and they've been putting it up as from court records

2963
03:25:20,560 --> 03:25:27,400
It's all filed the arrest that what was reported to the FBI their reporting system that they've had for many decades

2964
03:25:27,400 --> 03:25:29,920
So you got 18,000 groups that can cross-check their info

2965
03:25:29,920 --> 03:25:32,080
It's been found to be some of the most accurate numbers out there

2966
03:25:32,080 --> 03:25:37,120
Everybody uses this is our most consistent crime data that we have in this country it comes from these numbers in fact

2967
03:25:37,120 --> 03:25:41,760
Do they do anything they've been caught inflating it to get money, so it's probably even lower than what they're saying but go over it

2968
03:25:41,760 --> 03:25:47,920
Well, okay, so what they have up right now is is from 1992 and if you use the basic calculation for percentages

2969
03:25:47,920 --> 03:25:55,560
You'll see that violent crime will start with that has been cut in half since 1992 the 1992 violent crime rate per 100,000 people was

2970
03:25:56,000 --> 03:26:02,480
757.7 if you subtract the 2011 violent crime rate that's 386.3 you get 371.4

2971
03:26:02,480 --> 03:26:06,560
You divide this by your original 1992 rate that gives you 0.49

2972
03:26:06,560 --> 03:26:13,340
Oh to multiply that out to find your percentage, and you're gonna have a decrease of forty nine point zero two percent in violent crime between

2973
03:26:13,680 --> 03:26:15,180
1992 and

2974
03:26:15,180 --> 03:26:22,920
2011 incredible and the murder rate shows the actually the same decrease from 1992 to 2011 in 1992 the rate was

2975
03:26:23,160 --> 03:26:24,440
9.3 in

2976
03:26:24,440 --> 03:26:30,820
2011 it fell to 4.7 if you subtract you get 4.6 divide that by your 1992 base rate and again you get a

2977
03:26:30,820 --> 03:26:38,380
49% decrease in murder rates in this country from 1992 to 2011 so it's cut in half we have half and

2978
03:26:39,180 --> 03:26:41,940
Actually all the major crime categories that the FBI does

2979
03:26:43,460 --> 03:26:47,820
Collects all this data for have dropped significantly between 1992 and 2011

2980
03:26:48,540 --> 03:26:49,940
As you can see here

2981
03:26:49,940 --> 03:26:57,580
I've got all the numbers up there every single one of those numbers has dropped every single one every one the only crime statistics

2982
03:26:57,580 --> 03:27:01,180
We see another report on this is the petty crime because criminals are afraid to home invade

2983
03:27:01,420 --> 03:27:04,220
Karjak now or knock a woman on the head and that was just

2984
03:27:04,860 --> 03:27:08,220
Prolific decades ago because they're scared of getting blown away now you look at

2985
03:27:08,460 --> 03:27:11,900
What you ought to do in the next few days is do this versus British crime rates

2986
03:27:11,900 --> 03:27:18,140
They've got those numbers just the muggings the stabbings are just off of the charts a much higher rate of rape there than we do

2987
03:27:18,140 --> 03:27:22,940
Here also their rape is going off the charts. I mean a lot of their stuff their violent crime is going off the charts

2988
03:27:22,940 --> 03:27:26,340
It's much they estimate many states a third of women are packing heat in their purse

2989
03:27:26,340 --> 03:27:28,220
You're gonna try to rape her in the parking garage

2990
03:27:28,220 --> 03:27:29,260
Well, they're there

2991
03:27:29,260 --> 03:27:35,940
They've calling Britain the violent crime capital of the UK because it's higher their rates are higher for violent crime than I believe

2992
03:27:36,220 --> 03:27:40,860
Australia South Africa here and Canada so we cover all the statistics

2993
03:27:41,060 --> 03:27:44,980
Yeah, that's and that's all the the graphics that I have here all these different statistics

2994
03:27:44,980 --> 03:27:50,520
But I mean all of these are consistently down every single thing is consistently down anybody can go they can get these reports

2995
03:27:50,520 --> 03:27:53,380
They can see they've put them up every year for the last 20 years

2996
03:27:53,380 --> 03:27:57,980
So they can go to the FBI they can download all of it. They can download it for their state

2997
03:27:57,980 --> 03:28:03,020
They can look at all of this different information right down, and then you can double-check. Let's say you live in

2998
03:28:03,980 --> 03:28:09,540
Fresno, California, or let's say you live in get your specific city, and you can clear water, Florida

2999
03:28:09,540 --> 03:28:13,060
You can go check those numbers check it with the newspapers 20 years

3000
03:28:13,060 --> 03:28:19,020
You can look at that and they do this every single year and like I said this is used every time a criminal justice study

3001
03:28:19,020 --> 03:28:21,040
Is done it's pretty much used every class

3002
03:28:21,040 --> 03:28:26,860
I had in grad school we use this data because this is the most consistent data that we have and some people like to detract

3003
03:28:26,860 --> 03:28:32,220
And argue about this data and say well it crime is underreported, but if anything I would say

3004
03:28:32,820 --> 03:28:37,840
This is the bit was underreported them, and there are obviously some unreported crimes, but that's a constant

3005
03:28:37,840 --> 03:28:39,940
Yeah in the pool a lot of statistics

3006
03:28:39,940 --> 03:28:41,740
I've read of show it's more reported now

3007
03:28:41,740 --> 03:28:45,820
It's easier to report as the internet or report and they let you do it with anonymity which is

3008
03:28:46,020 --> 03:28:51,020
unconstitutional in the past you had to go face your accuser right and over the years the FBI has made their system of

3009
03:28:51,020 --> 03:28:56,060
Reporting from these local agencies easier for them to report their data as well and have a much more consistent

3010
03:28:56,060 --> 03:28:59,220
Well everybody knows there's less crime when I was growing up in Dallas

3011
03:28:59,220 --> 03:29:02,140
I remember some weeks when they were like 60 something dead

3012
03:29:02,700 --> 03:29:07,240
And because you know in the 60s and 70s everything got real anti-gun and gunnership went way down

3013
03:29:07,240 --> 03:29:11,140
They were winning their war body was getting rid of their guns crime exploded all over

3014
03:29:11,140 --> 03:29:16,660
But then guns came back and criminals are scared, but any police will tell you that I mean look

3015
03:29:16,660 --> 03:29:19,480
You come you you home invade in Texas. You're probably gonna die

3016
03:29:19,480 --> 03:29:23,480
Yeah, I mean I've read I read a statistic say and I didn't bring this one in here with me

3017
03:29:23,480 --> 03:29:28,080
But assault weapons are only used in what 0.6% of all murders

3018
03:29:28,080 --> 03:29:31,680
I know and I kept trying to tell it's kind of kept trying to tell pierce morgan

3019
03:29:31,680 --> 03:29:37,480
Hey, these aren't even used you're using this as just a tiny example to blow it up to pull on people's heartstrings

3020
03:29:37,480 --> 03:29:41,480
He's like how many murders in England with guns, and I'm like how many murders with knives

3021
03:29:41,480 --> 03:29:46,680
And he didn't even cite his sources and then Ben Swann went on and did a report to show all of his sources were incorrect

3022
03:29:46,680 --> 03:29:49,580
Anyway, that was a lot higher in England than what he said great job
