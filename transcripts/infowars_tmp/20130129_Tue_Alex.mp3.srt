1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,520
Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does

2
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:21,640
he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.

3
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:33,800
All right, ladies and gentlemen, it is the 29th day of January, 2013. I'm your host,

4
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:38,480
Alex Jones. And again, I've told the producers, no guess today, because I want to be able

5
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,120
to play a lot of different clips and analyze them and take your phone calls.

6
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:47,960
We're going to open the phones up for first-time callers throughout the broadcast today. That's

7
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:52,520
first-time callers, and I'll give the number out coming up the next segment. And I'm gonna

8
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:59,360
try again, almost always fail, to go to them early in the shower. If you go up to prisonplanet.com

9
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:03,360
or infowars.com, our news website, you'll notice some of the headlines.

10
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:10,420
DHS boss praises trampling a posse commentatis at National Police Confab. They had another

11
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:18,080
Army Special Forces drill, unannounced, next to a school, terrorizing people in Houston.

12
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,440
The day before that, it was Miami, all part of martial law conditioning. Chinese Communist

13
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:28,040
Party mouthpiece demands Obama disarm Americans again.

14
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:32,560
Watson did a great job writing that article, but I think I'm gonna, as editor here, just

15
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:44,080
make the call that we need to add to that again. But this is the official People's Daily,

16
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:51,240
just amazing, a subsidiary of the People's Daily. Ron Paul, US action in Mali is another

17
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,840
undeclared war, absolutely.

18
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,760
Houston residents, I mentioned this, rattled by government gunfire and helicopters. And

19
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:08,440
again, that's powerful, but when you read the actual article, it's the Army, the Army.

20
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:14,320
Here's the headline out of ABC News, Army drill scares residents on Houston's south

21
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:21,040
side. Amazing, this stuff's happening every couple days now.

22
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,640
But I thought black helicopters didn't exist. In fact, I was seeing the local Miami TV station

23
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:30,120
video on YouTube yesterday. I meant to play it whenever it got to it, cuz we've been conditioned

24
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,920
to accept it, I guess. It's not even news anymore. And it showed these black helicopters

25
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,680
flying through the city and firing machine guns and all the rest of it.

26
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:44,800
And people in the comments are like, I thought the black helicopters didn't exist. Because

27
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:50,940
back in about 1995, when I first got on air on Access TV, people would call me and they'd

28
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,560
say, man, we just had black helicopters here. They blew up a warehouse. And I'd say, now

29
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,040
those don't exist, come on, cuz the Internet didn't really operate very well then.

30
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:07,580
But people would mail me, wasn't very prolific then, Johnny on the spot at that point, like

31
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:15,480
it is now. I would be mailed local news articles out of South Texas, out of California, out

32
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:22,440
of St. Louis, Missouri, out of you name it. And then I'd go on air just locally on TV

33
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,440
and then just locally by 96 on radio.

34
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,800
And I'd say, here's this newspaper reporting on 100 commandos blowing up the old police

35
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:35,400
station and this lady had a heart attack. And they actually had the local paper come

36
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:41,840
out and say I was insane, none of it existed. Again, knowing their audience said, do you

37
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,920
believe the Austin American statesmen, big respected newspaper, or that crazy guy on

38
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,480
the radio?

39
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,160
And so I kinda got obsessed with black helicopters. Not because I was obsessed with the black

40
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:59,000
helicopters themselves, but I became known by many as the black helicopter man. The media

41
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,200
called me that on hard copy and extra. And Jay Leno called me the black helicopter man

42
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:10,520
couple times. And so I was like, no, no, the helicopters are real.

43
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:15,480
So I started going to drills I was tipped off about by the army. So I'd say on air I'd

44
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,780
say army, folks at Fort Hood, next time you're doing a drill with the Fort Benning, Georgia

45
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:26,280
Night Stalkers or Delta Force or somebody, let me know. Well, needless to say, army special

46
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,800
operations did not like that and that's when the dirty tricks began.

47
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,660
Didn't matter though, I got the black helicopters on tape, you didn't stop me. And now they're

48
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:41,260
just everywhere. So that's a side issue that's coming up as well. Big sis addressed the big

49
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:45,560
law enforcement association and said, we're gonna use the army on the American people.

50
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,800
The number one threat is extremist. And she went on to say, the extremists are the ones

51
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,840
doing the mass shootings. So she's blaming constitutionalist for the school shootings

52
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,120
now.

53
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:01,560
Just an unbelievably degenerate piece of trash.

54
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:06,240
Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our

55

at the surface. But rather we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin nourishing

61

85
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:32,400
to Alex Jones.

86
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:53,400
There is no turning back on the run. What an enchanting voice. Hard to turn that off.

87
00:08:53,400 --> 00:09:02,480
Monday through Friday, ladies and gentlemen, we are here 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central Standard

88
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:09,840
Time. That's Robert Plant, if you don't know who it is, 1983. The song is Big Log.

89
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:18,760
Okay, ladies and gentlemen, it is Tuesday, the 29th day of January 2013. Again, hard

90
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:25,720
to believe the first month of 2013 is almost gone. Here's the deal. I run into so many

91
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:30,280
people who say we like what you're doing with the radio show and the TV show.

92
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:34,360
We don't know what it is, but you've upped your game. You're more intense, you're more

93
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:39,260
focused, you cover more news. It's just getting better all around. And I chalk that up to

94
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:44,200
the times are so dangerous, the shadows are so long, nightfall here that it's got me a

95
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:48,180
little more focused, a little more serious, though we still have some fun. And of course,

96
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,400
the crew is upping their game as well.

97
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:55,560
Our supporters have been helping us get the word out. So many new M&FM affiliates, I have

98
00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:01,880
a couple more to announce today, are picking us up. And so we are very, very blessed that

99
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:08,000
in this time of corruption, for every action, there is a equal and opposite reaction. And

100
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,920
we are that reaction. So the one thing I haven't really gotten better at, and I say this almost

101
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:20,220
every day, because I'm like in a rut, it's a pattern I follow, is that when I do say

102
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:24,060
I'm going to your calls, I don't tend to do it.

103
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:29,160
Because I've got so much incredible news here that I tend to just go off and all that instead

104
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:34,460
of taking the calls that so many times call in and mention news items I'm not aware of

105
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:38,760
or that I forgot to cover. And quite frankly, when I'm listening to rebroadcast, I think

106
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,760
that's some of the best and most informative radio we do.

107
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:48,520
So here's the deal, first time callers today, all three hours, first time callers, ladies

108
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:55,680
and gentlemen, any issue you wanna raise, any topic you wanna bring up, 800-259-9231,

109
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:02,960
800-259-9231. We've got a bunch of special reports we're gonna be premiering here on

110
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,960
air as well.

111
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:09,840
One of them is satirical, speaking of having fun, but it's not fun. I mean, I had an idea

112
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:17,480
last Friday, and I'm gonna air this at the bottom of the hour. While we were shooting

113
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:23,520
the news and things at about six o'clock at night, I said, you know what? I've got more

114
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:28,960
articles of people being arrested or threatened with arrest for bubble guns, Hello Kitty things,

115
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:37,560
super soakers, bright orange Nerf guns in their front yards, panics, just incredible

116
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,560
stuff.

117
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,960
There's an article today where a guy put on Facebook him holding his one-year-old and

118
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:48,040
had a BB gun in his hand. I mean, I can't tell you how many family photos we've got

119
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:52,680
where I'm sitting in grandpa's lap and he's got a shotgun. I mean, everybody's taking

120
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:57,180
the Old West photos, at least most people I know have been in their houses, they've

121
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,180
got them.

122
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:01,840
I remember being in Tombstone when I was about seven years old, my parents, and we went and

123
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:06,440
sat down as a family and my dad had a shotgun and my mom had a pistol in her hand and you

124
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:12,320
put on the old Western clothes. This guy had an unloaded BB gun, put it on his Facebook

125
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,460
and got SWAT teamed and arrested.

126
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:19,920
And I read all the time, I know you see it in the news where it's always the same MO,

127
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:25,160
some old vet lives out in the country where the edge of the city's growing. And they're

128
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:29,720
cleaning guns in their garage and the SWAT team comes and arrest him and says, he's arrested,

129
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:33,920
he had 25 guns. They're all legal, but we call this an arsenal.

130
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:44,120
Well, then how'd you arrest him? It's a hysteria. And I had the idea to have us all get in the

131
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:48,640
conference room and act like they're having a meeting about the news cuz we do have meetings

132
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:53,240
about what's coming up the next week and what we think we wanna focus on and ideas.

133
00:12:53,240 --> 00:13:00,520
It's kinda like a newsroom pitch to the editor. We have those a couple days a week. A lot

134
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:04,600
of times we have them in the hallway. We'll just discuss things we're gonna be working

135
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:10,440
and ideas. So we did it in one take and it's been pretty popular. Alex Jones goes on Rampage

136
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,640
with bubble gun.

137
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:16,720
But a lot of people said, yeah, this is really funny. Thank God it's not like this. No, no,

138
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:22,400
you don't understand. It's based on real people being SWAT teamed for playing with Nerf guns

139
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:30,500
in their front yard. I mean, I've seen reports where a kid has a slingshot in their backyard

140
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:35,840
and the police are called, or a little kid says bang bang in the pickup truck driving

141
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,640
by somebody and the police are called.

142
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:43,340
It's about saying we're all suspects, we're all bad, we're all corrupt. Everybody is under

143
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:47,380
suspicion except for the government. You see, in a free society, the government is under

144
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:52,800
suspicion. It's kept small, it's kept on a short leash in a tyranny that is the norm

145
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,560
throughout history. And I make that point cuz it's hard to have liberty.

146
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:01,240
You better work for it. And you get liberty and you get prosperity, you become decadent

147
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,240
and go back into slavery. That's the only problem with liberty is it produces so much

148
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:11,420
wealth that, well, people's kids become spoiled brats and then their kids become tyrants.

149
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:17,360
So we shot this video and a lot of people thought, this is really funny how people are

150
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,640
freaking out about guns, but this is a bubble gun. No, no, no, no, this is based on real

151
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:27,320
stuff that happened. So I'm gonna air it here on air. It's even more funny with the video,

152
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,720
but I'm gonna air it coming up.

153
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:36,120
The video is up at infowars.com. It's already rolled off the front page into the featured

154
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:43,000

Or if it doesn't work on this computer, we can just punch it up right there. Yeah, exactly.

159
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:12,080
If it ever doesn't work on here, we can just do it in there. It's infowars.com. Okay, anyways,

00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:16,760

00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:28,480
area right there for all of the news feed.

163
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:36,240
But we're gonna be playing that piece coming up. Now, going over this, DHS boss praises

164
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:44,520
trampling a posse commentatis at National Police Confab. That's Janet Big Sis Napolitano.

165
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:52,120
Chinese Communist Party mouthpiece demands Obama disarm Americans again. This is an official

166
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:59,840
sub publication of the People's Daily, the official Communist Party mouthpiece. Ron Paul,

167
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:03,120
US Action in Mali is another undeclared war, no kidding.

168
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:08,320
Houston residents rattled by government gunfire and helicopters. By the way, by the army.

169
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:13,560
Here's ABC News, army drills scares residents on Houston's south side. And again, they just

170
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:21,640
had the army drill two days ago in Miami. So Sunday, it's in Miami and Monday, it's

171
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:27,600
in Houston. And we're now getting reports of other unannounced army drills where they

172
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,500
set buildings on fire, blow things up.

173
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:37,360
What they do is they covertly lease a facility. A lot of times it's the police department

174
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:42,960
or part of it and then they attack it. And in the role playing, they train to take on

175
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:47,280
the American people. Now, I would tell you this 15 years ago, ten years ago, I would

176
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:52,000
show you the documents, the proof, people said there's no way that's real.

177
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,400
Now, what's really happening here is you're just being acclimated. They have huge bases,

178
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:02,520
facilities everywhere. I've talked to the emergency managers who were let in on what's

179
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:11,280
happening. I've talked to the army officers. I've talked to all of them from every different

180
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:16,640
angle and facet of this. And it is to acclimate the military, the police, and the public that

181
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,800
it's normal to have troops on the streets.

182
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:24,720
And we have an article out today by Kurt Nemo, DHS boss praises trampling and posse comitatus

183
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:33,100
at national police confab. And actually have her remarks printed off. It's also linked

184
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:40,200
in the article. And she talks about the new threat is gun owners and the same story, the

185
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:45,360
extremist. And she goes on to say extremist and mass shootings.

186
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:56,040
So there are no cases of what they call anti-government people in the last 15, 16, 17 years I can

187
00:17:56,040 --> 00:18:02,520
think of. And Oklahoma City was a bombing that was staged where a patriot or a returning

188
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:08,360
veteran has gone in and shot up a school. But they are now deploying the army. That's

189
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:13,580
what happened in Houston. It was a drill at a school to fight active shooters as if the

190
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:17,240
police couldn't do that.

191
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:21,800
And they are deploying the army of the Kentucky Derby, the army and all these big cities,

192
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:32,640
the army at the airports, the subways, the Marines. In my film Road to Tyranny, we show

193
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:38,480
countless clips of this that we shot in the film. I'm just giving you sources to look

194
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,440
it up, the 2007 film Endgame.

195
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,760
I'm in New York, and we're in a restaurant about 10 o'clock at night. And they go, hey,

196
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:55,600
the army's running around outside. So we go outside, and the army is dancing and partying

197
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:01,400
across the street with a bunch of professional wrestlers. I mean, it was like clownish cuz

198
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:05,720
Madison Square Garden was right there, professional wrestlers were getting off buses going in.

199
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:10,680
And there were these white vans. Well, you can see the video. And they see me and start

200
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:16,280
cussing, and they've got, I know they're supposed to carry Berettas.

201
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:22,960
They look like blue slash stainless steel 45s to me. People said, Alex, that's ridiculous.

202
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:28,240
Instead of just looking at the video, they go, don't say it was 45s cuz they carry Berettas.

203
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:33,480
I know that. They look like 45s to me. They run over and start cussing and get in my face.

204
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:39,200
I said, come on. I mean, that's the point we're getting to. We're the Baghdad people.

205
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,520
See, this is an occupation. Now, the average person, that's when the army's used against

206
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,360
us. Now, who's the army training to fight? The veterans, who they know were older and

207
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,780
more seasoned, who are gonna wake up.

208
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:53,240
So I haven't even gotten to the news. We're gonna go to your phone calls first, and then

209
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:56,880
I'll just get into all of it. It's all off the charts, and it's all online right now

211
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:06,000
Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive? From natural disasters

212
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,580
like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought, to the family hardships brought on

213
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:15,680
by a disastrous economy. Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything. At eFoods

216
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:29,060
wrote, almost all of the grocery stores are closed, but I managed to get my eFoods just

217
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:34,720
in time to be able to help my sister and niece. It is better to be prepared 10 years too early

Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors

238
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,840
want to talk about gold IRAs? They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry

239
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:43,520
won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement. Gold has outperformed paper investments,

240

yet no word about IRAs. If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.

257
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:35,640
You rarely see anything truthful coming out of Al Jazeera, it's the globalist propaganda

258
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:41,560
front. But they interviewed the president of Iceland, the only country to not collapse

259
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:45,900
under banker austerity, and they asked him why. And he basically said, we arrested the

260
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,160
bankers cuz it wasn't our debt.

261
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:53,200
See, they signed us on to 644 trillion, that's a three year old number out of the Washington

262
00:24:53,200 --> 00:25:00,220
Post of the 1.5 global quadrillion, it's 1,500 trillion. And they tell us we owe 16 trillion

263
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:05,520
and that we're bankrupted. By the way, Governor Rick Perry is set to give a press conference

264
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:10,360
in a few minutes, calling to give $12 billion in the rainy day fund, I'm gonna cover this

265
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:13,760
coming up, back to Texans.

266
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:17,520
That'll just be a free check to everybody, so everybody thinks he'll be a popular guy

267
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:22,280
to vote for for president. He's a globalist and I'm gonna explain why coming up. Why not

268
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:28,880
give us the money in the comprehensive annual financial report slush funds? The public doesn't

269
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:33,880
know that over 70% of the tax money goes to offshore private banks, and you can even get

270
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:37,000
reports from your own state and local governments on it.

271
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:43,360
Folks, you're living in a matrix of deceit, it is mind blowing. All right, I promise to

272
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:47,520
go to your calls, we're gonna take a lot of them today, intersperse with the news and

273
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:53,640
all the clips. Let's go ahead and talk to Travis in Indiana, you're on the air, welcome.

274
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,040
What's up, Alex?

275
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,040
Hey, buddy.

276
00:25:56,040 --> 00:26:00,680
Hey, I had some friends talking about some explosions that were happening here in Indianapolis

277
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:05,320
a couple weeks ago. And when I did some research online and looked into it, I found this YouTube

278
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:10,160
video, I sent it to show tips. I just wanted you to look at it, analyze it, and let me

279
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:14,160
know what you think it is.

280
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:19,200
They're having military drills in basically every city, they have about 1,000 a year we

281
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,720
know of. Some of them where they have the Boy Scouts helping do door to door gun confiscation

282
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:28,200
simulations and I have that on film. And even in the New York Times Renew Listener, I'm

283
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:33,600
not joking, the Boy Scouts trying to take your guns and do other things now.

284
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:39,960
But I see in the comment you said military drill sent video, what's on the video?

285
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:44,680
The video is, it's like some lights or orbs in the sky and then it looks to be some sort

286
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:49,320
of like a fire trail almost like a missile. And when you hear it, it sounds almost like

287
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:54,240
a missile and then the impact sets all the car alarms off, the dogs start going crazy.

288
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,920
It's just out of this world.

289
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:02,440
Yeah, well, send it again to showtipsatinfoawards.com. Sometimes we miss stuff and we don't respond.

290
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:07,200
Send it again and let us know it's urgent. Thank you so much. I'll look at that video,

291
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,880
send it again right now if you can. Look, since you bring this up and since I got back

292
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:18,520
into black helicopters because I realized yesterday I mentioned the Miami assault drill

293
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:26,800
and I mentioned that the army was involved in Houston again yesterday.

294
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:35,040
I was the leading expert on this. Again, just because my listeners in 95, 96, when I first

295
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:43,120
got on air, would call in and say, my cousin lives in St. Louis and there were 15 black

296
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:48,160
helicopters there and they burned a building down. And I'd say, okay, get them to mail

297
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:51,880
it to me and it would come in the mail and it'd be the local paper.

298
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:56,280
And it would say residents claim they saw black helicopters and troops. A building did

299
00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:02,800
burn down, but nothing happened. And I'd go, okay, and then people started sending me video

300
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:08,480
and it's in my films. You'd see black helicopters, guys coming down off ropes, stuff blowing

301
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,680
up. And then I'd cover it and people'd say that doesn't exist.

302
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:18,040
And then Delta Force crashed in Houston, people got killed. Soldier of Fortune wrote a story

303
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:22,600
about it. Houston Chronicle said it didn't happen and didn't exist. So it's a way to

304
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:28,360
see will the media play national security with the military industrial complex? Can

305
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:35,040
they have, I mean, I've seen drills where they have 1,000 or more Marines in a small

306
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:39,400
Alabama town walking around in people's yards.

307
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,640
And husbands come out and say, what are you doing? They just put handcuffs on you and

308
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:48,760
take it to jail. And then that's not in the news. It's all just to see what they can do.

309
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:53,520
And they've done countless drills. I staked one of these out in Corpus Christi. That did

310
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:58,080
get in the paper by like 99 or so, they started covering it, cuz World Net Daily was covering

311
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,640
it at the time and no one could ignore it.

312
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:04,000
And I was feeding World Net Daily videos and photos. Who was their writer then covering?

313
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:09,960
It was like David Bresnahan was his name. And that's the frustration. You're there,

314
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:13,860
you're in San Antonio, the police chief says Delta Force came in here with a bag of money

315
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:20,080
to buy me off. And then I have the video and people say that's not really the police chief.

316
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:26,680
Or we're down in San Antonio and MPs come up with guns and take our cameras away. I

317
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:31,240
mean that happened to us.

318
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:35,320
And then the media says you're insane, it doesn't exist. It's all an acclamation for

319
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:40,480
martial law. So that they can missile attack or assassinate whoever they want, kill whoever

320
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:45,800
they want. And everybody's just been taught, hey, you didn't see those black helicopters.

321
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:50,280
That's a conspiracy theory. That's crazy.

322
00:29:50,280 --> 00:30:01,360
There on the march, the empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection. When you're sleeping

We are on the march. The empire is on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.

358
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:21,800
You see, because the public doesn't research legislation or read publications put out by

359
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:28,080
MIT and Rand Corporation, they just hear a guy saying, hey, there's black helicopters

360
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:32,980
doing urban warfare drills. And people say, well, that's not true. The media makes fun

361
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:38,860
of that. That doesn't exist. You're insane. In fact, I happened to come across a Democratic

362
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:44,320
Party operative radio show yesterday and I was sitting there in the car listening for

363
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,240
about 15 minutes.

364
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,840
And they were talking about how crazy I was and that I believe that the Federal Reserve

365
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:54,880
is private. And that I believe, I'd mentioned the name, but I wanna give them attention.

366
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:59,400
That's how small they are. And that I'm tempted to get the author on. They had an author on

367
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:05,240
with them, who's written a book about how we're all crazy. And that I believe in black

368
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,240
helicopters.

369
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:13,240
No, I just, I read about, let's not exaggerate. I scan over probably 400 articles a day. I

370
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:24,840
probably read 100. And every week for 17 years on air, I have been mailed or read a

371
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:31,200
lot online, mainstream news about urban warfare and black helicopters. And then people sit

372
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,400
there with a straight face going, we define reality.

373
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:40,520
The Federal Reserve isn't private. There are no black helicopters. There is no world government.

374
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:45,060
And I'm like, but I have 15 clips of world leaders calling for world government. I have

375
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:53,500
a whole stack of news here. And ABC Nightline was here two years ago. And I knew they were

376
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:56,600
gonna say that because they told me some of the questions before they got here.

377
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:59,720
And I brought them in there. I've told the story 100 times. And I said, here's the clip

378
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:05,160
of Herman Van Rompuy. Here's Gordon Brown. Here's David Rockefeller. And I showed him

379
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:08,600
a couple of clips. He goes, I don't need to see anymore. That's a different world government

380
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:13,120
than what you're talking about.

381
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:17,600
And that's why then 30 minutes later, we left here to go shoot another interview at a park

382
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:21,240
down the street. And I said, well, you first said world government doesn't exist. Now you're

383
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:25,340
saying it's a good thing. And he goes, I don't even agree they're forming a world government.

384
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:29,700
And that's why I said, well, that's why you're discredited. But see, they edited all that

385
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:30,700
out.

386
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:34,180
I said, well, I just showed you all the videos and all their admissions and their definition

387
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:39,600
of world government. You can't tell me they're not getting rid of posse commentatas to put

388
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:45,260
troops on the streets. Now it's all happened, you notice. You can't tell me that they're

389
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:47,220
not going to set up TSA checkpoints.

390
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:52,460
It's now happening everywhere. You can't tell me they're not going to keep raising all the

391
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:58,200
different taxes till we're bankrupt. But again, they sit there with confidence as confidence

392
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:04,820
men and go, there's no world government. There's no black helicopters. And that is so fundamentally

393
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:09,720
frustrating because if the general public was informed, even when the black helicopters

394
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:14,280
come and attack your city to condition you.

395
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:19,420
The media, when they now admit it will go, well, they're just here for our safety. But

396
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:24,540
they'll never say, I guess the black helicopter people were right. You've all heard the term

397
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:29,700
black helicopter people. Anybody that doesn't trust government, that's called common sense.

398
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:35,300
You're a black helicopter person. And if you ever saw one, or one ever flew over your house

399
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:41,420
has happened to so many people with infrared sensors scanning your home, or ground penetrating

400
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:44,900
radar, which they now admit they're doing. We knew they were doing it 15 years ago, they

401
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,100
now admit it.

402
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:51,900
Well, now you're a black helicopter person if you don't like the black helicopter. Before

403
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:57,660
you were a kook, if you said they existed, but instead of, you were right about everything.

404
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:04,620
Tell us what else is happening. You were correct, we apologize. Instead, it's your bad. In fact,

405
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:08,140
you're even worse than you've ever been.

406
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:12,940
Because people think that if they're just delusional and tell themselves everything

407
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:21,140
is okay, it's gonna be okay. No, it's not gonna be okay. And I've got Janet Napolitano

408
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:26,180
saying the number one threat again at the big police chief and sheriff's association

409
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:31,580
meeting that all the other globalist leadership was at.

410
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:36,420
The people that have conquered this country through fraud and propaganda, they're brainwashing

411
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:41,300
the police. And we have it linked in Kurt Nemo's article, DHS boss praises trampling

412
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:46,100
and posse comitatus at national police confab. Yeah, trampling of the 10th Amendment as well.

413
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:49,900
And her speech as well, we're merging the federal government with the local government.

414
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:53,840
We're working together well, and we're now ready to face the number one threat, gun owners

415
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:56,260
and extremists using guns.

416
00:37:56,260 --> 00:38:01,100
There are no militia patriots. You don't see it anywhere. I mean, what, there have been

417
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:07,900
a couple, I guess, of events where cops pull somebody over with warrants who says they're

418
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:11,100
a sovereign citizen and the cops get shot. I guess there have been a couple of those

419
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:13,700
events, but statistically incredibly rare.

420
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:19,280
No mass shootings at schools, but she ties it into that. And they got four TV shows now

421
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:25,260
coming out or airing in the next month where there's militias that are the new terrorists.

422
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:30,420
It's not Jack Bauer's got to torture people cuz Habib is a terrorist. Well, that's a foreign

423
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:32,300
or torture him, according to the media.

424
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:38,780
No, no, no, now it's that veteran down the street. He's a terrorist. So it's a full rollout

425
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:45,540
with military drills and checkpoints intensifying to a level we've never seen. Armored vehicles,

426
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:52,240
urban assault vehicles, huge surveillance trucks breaking into our phones, Google cars

427
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:56,020
driving around spying, Homeland Security grants.

428
00:38:56,020 --> 00:39:02,420
In every major city, putting microphones and cameras in the buses and even in the cabs

429
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:06,580
with government grants to listen to you and record everything you're doing. Government

430
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:11,900
grants after the shootings for gunshot detectors that are really shotgun mics to listen to

431
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:12,900
everybody.

432
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:16,840
This is happening at an accelerated rate. Let's go to your phone calls. Scott in Vermont,

433
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,840
you're on the air.

434
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:18,840
Hello, Alex.

435
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:19,840
Hey, buddy.

436
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:25,360
Talk to you again. A couple quick ideas to throw at you about Tom Hartman and the Obama

437
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:30,460
phone lady. It was a great show and I tried to call in with this. My idea was that InfoWars

438
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:37,940
puts together a video exposing how Obama and our Pentagon and Leon Panetta throw that in

439
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:42,860
there about how he's admitted that Congress is basically ceremonial, showing how he's

440
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:48,340
killed over 3,000 innocent people in Pakistan and Yemen, many of them children, with the

441
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:49,340
drones.

442
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:54,820
And you can have Michelle come back and narrate the video. And in the name of the video and

443
00:39:54,820 --> 00:40:00,200
at the beginning, she can announce the Obama drone and that funny voice of hers where she

444
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:07,460
did the Obama phone thing. But that and Tom Hartman, you need to get on his show or you've

445
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:12,820
had him on your show once before, I think. And you need to do that again and rip into

446
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:18,820
him about the... He's been demonizing the militia as being racist in origin and twisting

447
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:20,780
the whole meaning of the Second Amendment and the Constitution.

448
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:26,580
No, no, they all go off a PR sheet that gun owners are racist, they're gonna kill everybody.

449
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:30,460
And I'm fully aware of it. I mean, it's the same sheet of music. These guys are going

450
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:34,300
off talking points. You might as well just get the sheet and repeat it to yourself over

451
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,300
and over again.

452
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:40,660
Listen, I appreciate your points there. Thank you for the call. Yeah, we're gonna get a

453
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:47,820
icon of Paul Revere up at the top of infoawars.com the next day or so. It'll be a little horse

454
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:53,380
with a bullhorn, a tri-cornered hat, minute man riding a horse with a bullhorn. And you'll

455
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:59,220
click on that and it will take you to infoawars.com forward slash contest.

456
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:06,840
You've now got three months exactly today until April 30th to get your film, whether

457
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:15,540
it's a short film or long film, produced and emailed to paulrevere at infoawars.com. And

458
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:20,220
to then also print off and sign and agree to the contest rules.

459
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:27,020
And you can win $100,000 first place, but it's not about ideas for us. I'm not gonna

460
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:32,500
make the film. And I see so many people saying I wish I had a film degree. I don't have a

461
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:37,020
film degree, folks, and my films have been seen. Let's be conservative. All my films

462
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:46,560
and special reports, 600 million times. I just said that number and I can't even believe

463
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,100
I just said that number.

464
00:41:48,100 --> 00:42:05,180
And by the way, that's conservative, 600 million times on YouTube alone. 600 million times,

465
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:10,420
the special reports, the films, all of it, conservatively. Last night I was going through

466
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:15,300
people's channels that host the show and there were hundreds of them that had a couple million

467
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,800
views per channel, all my stuff.

468
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:21,740
And then one of our big channels right at 300 million. And then other channels we've

469
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:26,900
got 50 million, 40 million, 20 million, 10 million, 18 million, 17 million. I mean, it's

470
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:32,140
just, it's unbelievable. 600 million is a conservative number. So what I'm doing is

471
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:38,460
I'm turning you loose and the real prize is not winning $100,000.

472
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:44,420
It's fighting the globalist. Even if you don't win, you win by getting involved. You win

473
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:51,100
by taking action. You win by resisting. And then the real prize is we're gonna hire crews

474
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:58,540
or produce crews that has produced films out of the top people. You understand that, folks?

475
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:03,940
This is a big deal. This is a big deal. This is, who is the next great documentary filmmakers?

476
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:08,540
Okay, cuz I'll be frank with you. I'm up here a lot of days till six, seven, eight at night

477
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:09,940
and then I'm working when I get home.

478
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:14,460
I'm working on the weekends. I'm not complaining about it. It's just that I don't have time.

479
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:18,540
I will not just make, and I've made some powerful films, but there are clips of this, clips

480
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:23,140
of that, clips of interviews I did, some scenery. If I ever do another film, I wanna do one

481
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:28,900
where it's full production and I really, cuz I love film, I really wanna make a powerful

482
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:32,460
cinematic film.

483
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:36,420
I'm not gonna sell wine until it's time, as Orson Welles used to say, we will sell no

484
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:40,820
wine until it's time. I got great crew making many documentaries, making great reports.

485
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:45,580
We're getting better and better. We're reaching more people. I wanna turn you loose. So go

486
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:54,860
to mfoawars.com forward slash contest and join Operation Paul Revere now. Let's go to,

487
00:43:54,860 --> 00:44:02,180
I don't know how to pronounce that. Is it Bessemembra? Besimbria in Louisiana. You're

488
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:03,660
on the air, go ahead.

489
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:11,580
Hi Alex, how are you? I'm fine, thank you. Wonderful. I don't wanna get tongue tied or

490
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:17,940
get messed up here, but I just wanted to go back to chapter 12, page 225, and behold a

491
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:25,340
pale white horse. And the insert right here says, the government encouraged the manufacture

492
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:31,740
importation of military firearms for the criminals to use. This is intended to foster a feeling

493
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:36,260
of insecurity that will lead the American people to voluntary disarm themselves by passing

494
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:43,060
laws against firearms. Using drugs and hypnosis on mental patients and a process called Orion,

495
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:49,280
the CIA inculcated the desire to these people to open fire on schoolyards, thus inflame

496
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:54,900
the anti-gun lobby. This plan is well underway and so far it's working perfectly. The middle

497
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:59,180
class is beginning the government to do away with the second amendment. This book was written

498
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:07,740
in 1991, okay? The murder of Rabbi Meir Khan, the Stockton, California massacre, the school

499
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:13,420
shootings in the women's school in Canada, every one of the shooters were all mental

500
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:15,460
patients on the drug Prozac.

501
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:20,900
And then after that book was written, it was Buford Furrow, all of them, he had an address

502
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:26,900
in an Air Force base, was on drugs. About 99% of the time they're on psychotropics and

503
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:30,820
most of the time they're being handled by government psychiatrists. And yes, a bunch

504
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:37,680
of these are windup toys. They find a mentally ill person, I'm no psychiatrist. I could go

505
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:41,380
out in Austin, hypothetically, I'm not saying I'd do this, or they'll spin it and cut it

506
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:43,140
out of context.

507
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:48,300
You or I could go out and find a schizophrenic, give them all the money, drugs, whatever they

508
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:53,940
wanted and convince them to go shoot people, guaranteed. But they wouldn't do a very good

509
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:58,900
job of it, so you'd have to have somebody there dressed the same to really do the shooting,

510
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:01,620
then you shoot the schizophrenic in the back of the head.

511
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:07,460
Or they're so drugged up and you give them amnesics, like Sirhan Sirhan or the Batman

512
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:12,700
shooter of Aurora, and they won't even remember who they were.

513
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:16,980
And that's the thing, and that's what I was telling whoever answered the phone this morning.

514
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:21,700
I just started a new page through my Facebook and it's called America Fights Back. I got

515
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:26,540
a message from Facebook telling me that if I don't chill out with my tone with the stuff

516
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:29,340
that I'm posting on my page, they're gonna deactivate my account.

517
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:33,300
No, no, absolutely, ma'am, and I appreciate your call. Send us a copy of that message

518
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:39,700
to showtipsatinfoawars.com. Darren McBrain documented this, we've gotten these. We will

519
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:46,900
send out, we sent out Navy Seals Group's little meme. A meme is, again, just a little photo

520
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:48,060
with a short message.

521
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:54,740
And it was, we got Bin Laden, which itself is baloney, but we got Bin Laden and then,

522
00:46:54,740 --> 00:47:02,380
or we got baloney, and then you didn't save us in Benghazi. And Facebook deleted a bunch

523
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:07,020
of accounts, suspended accounts, and told us you will not send that out. And it was

524
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:10,620
actually one of our listeners had posted it on our account and sent it out.

525
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:16,700
But yeah, yeah, mild pro second amendment. Facebook is a joke. People say, well, then

526
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:22,860
why are you on it? We're using the enemy operation, the enemy combine, the enemy system, the enemy

527
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:29,300
data relay to jack into their matrix and try to warn people inside of it. And that's what

528
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:31,500
it is, folks, this is a war.

529
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:34,780
And if I can seize their weapons systems and use them against them, I'll do it all day

530
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:42,820
long. This isn't a game. The globalists are hardcore criminals coming down on us. William,

531
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:44,700
in California, you're on the air.

532
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:51,140
Hello, Alex. Hey, buddy. Hey, wow. This is, this is fantastic. I finally get to talk to

533
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:56,660
GI Jones. I just wanted to call you and let you know what a positive impact you've had

534
00:47:56,660 --> 00:48:03,900
on my life. A couple years ago, I had given up on everything, this country, my family,

535
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:09,620
everything. And I didn't believe you. I've been watching your show for about five years

536
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:14,440
now. I didn't believe anything you said. A couple of years ago, I started taking your

537
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:15,780
tangy tangerine.

538
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:22,740
I started really paying attention to the reports you do. And it's changing my life completely.

539
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:26,780
And I just wanted to let you know, I'm disabled. I've been disabled since birth. And we're

540
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:34,180
not all mind controlled drones. We're not all idiots. And I just wanted to tell you,

541
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:37,140
thank God you're here. And thank you for what you're doing.

542
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:42,100
Well, thank you, sir. That means a lot to me. Look, I became aware of this stuff as

543
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:48,260
a mainline libertarian, mainline Republican who was upset about Waco in Oklahoma City.

544
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:53,500
And then I saw all the urban warfare training, which the media said didn't exist. And I learned,

545
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:57,700
wow, the media knows this is going on and is lying.

546
00:48:57,700 --> 00:49:01,900
This is a takeover because I'd read history books. I knew what a takeover looked like.

547
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:05,820
And now we're deep into the takeover. They've already robbed the accounts, the dollar, the

548
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:10,480
future. The stock market's hopped up cuz it's on cheap dollars. It's really worth about

549
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,780
half of what it was a decade ago.

550
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:19,180
And this is real. I mean, that's all I can say to people is very bad people are in control.

551
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:23,740
But there are good people in corporations and government who don't know what's happening.

552
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:29,300
If we give them the rest of the story, they won't be compartmentalized and this conspiracy

553
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:30,300
can't succeed.

554
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:37,500
It is vital to decompartmentalize police, military, bureaucrats, and others. But don't

555
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:43,900
just count on government. We, in the private sector, have to assault the corrupt system

556
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:48,580
with the truth. We have to be aggressive. I mean, look, if they're really putting cancer

557
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:52,820
viruses in the vaccines and deadly fluoride in the water to brain damage us, and if the

558
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:57,580
White House science czar writes books bragging about it, which he has like eco science, we

559
00:49:57,580 --> 00:49:59,380
should be angry, shouldn't we?

560
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:04,120
Well, you know what? I am angry. This is a normal response. In fact, the more and more

561
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:08,260
I think about Piers Morgan, I'm so glad I was mean to him and I wish I would have been

562
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:14,420
meaner to him. Being nice has gotten us into this position. I wish I would have said more

563
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:19,220
that he was a hatchet man and a globalist front guy for eugenics.

564
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:21,780
So God bless you. Anything else you want to add?

565
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:28,500
Yeah, I completely agree. I just wanted to tell everybody I live on a $900 a month income.

566
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:34,340
I spend as much money as I can on Infowars.com. Last month I bought almost every one of your

567
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:40,140
shirts. I bought every one of your hats. Anything. I'm going to join the Paul Revere contest.

568
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:45,340
I'm going to do anything. I'm considering moving to Austin just to just to be closer

569
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:48,100
to your operation and do whatever I can.

570
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:51,940
Well, God bless you, sir. But remember, wherever you are is an important area to fight the

571
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:56,020
tyranny. And I wish people that didn't have money would not try to support us. It's the

572
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:59,460
folks out there that still have money. You better support liberty or you're going to

573
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:01,100
lose everything.

574
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:04,840
If you've ever wanted one of our best selling generators, but we're waiting for an offer

575
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:09,780
so crazy you couldn't refuse, then you're not going to want to miss this exciting message.

576
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:15,620
Here's why. Our solar generators provide life saving electrical power. And unlike gas generators,

577
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:20,700
solar generators run quietly, emit no fumes and produce electricity from the sun. So when

578
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:25,580
the lights go out, you'll always have the power you need. Now, here's the best part.

579
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:30,760
Every year we accumulate a few solar generators that we just can't sell as new. We put them

580

593
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:06,600
Is 2013 your year to achieve more? More vitality, more health, more well-being? Hi, this is

594
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:11,580
Pastor Jenny. For 25 years, I spent my life's work teaching others how to achieve more.

595
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:17,300
But in 2010, I got a lesson of my own about RNA drops. I learned that there are millions

596
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:21,940
of gene switches latent in every single cell of my body that are waiting for an activator.

597
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:27,060
I learned by taking RNA drops, I can begin to activate that power in my cells and achieve

598
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:31,340
the more that I desire. I'd like to share what I discovered with you and send you a

599
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:37,220
free 30-day supply of RNA drops valued at $50 for just the cost of shipping and handling.

602
00:53:55,060 --> 00:54:17,140
Come, you masters of war, here to build the big guns, here to build the death planes,

603
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:24,060
here to build all the bombs. The globalists say that, Chuck, Legoland,

604
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:30,980
Jabba the Hutt said is anti-Muslim. It's not meant to make sense. It's meant to get you

605
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:37,140
trained to be guilty whenever they say you're guilty, and to say, do whatever you want.

606
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:42,140
Raise my taxes, I'm not racist. Take my guns, I'm not racist. Okay, you're gonna arrest

607
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:46,700
my seven-year-old for playing with a Nerf gun in the front yard? That's reasonable.

608
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:52,060
A dad poses with a gun, a BB gun on Facebook, arrest him. We got a jury, we'll put him in

609
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:56,860
jail for something. It's not illegal to film police in public. Still, arrest everybody.

610
00:54:56,860 --> 00:55:01,820
I mean, do bureaucrats and people on their little petty power trips, are you smart enough

611
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:08,020
to understand that if the globalist will invade Iraq and kill a million plus people just to

612
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:13,020
control the oil, and actually cut off the supply of it to jack up prices?

613
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:19,460
There's more than one way to make money off something. Do you think they care about you?

614
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:25,100
If the government 12 years ago stole the death benefits of the entire military, and it was

615
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:29,500
a minor footnote in the back of the newspaper, do you think they care about you? See if there's

616
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:34,740
no checks and balances for the general public, and for other people, there's not gonna be

617
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:37,240
any checks and balances for you.

618
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:42,080
There's no lobby for basic liberty. The only reason we still got guns is cuz there's a

619
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:49,180
gun lobby. And there's money to be made by select corporations off gun sales. The globalist

620
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:52,940
have always sold weapons to everybody. And so they're kind of schizophrenic on the issue

621
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:57,680
of guns, because they want total control, but they also like to sell guns.

622
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:01,820
The only reason we still got a Second Amendment is because our forebearers fought for it.

623
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:07,420
It's been tribally handed down as a tradition. And you've been active and it's something

624
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:12,220
you physically understand. You know your gun, you know your rights, so you still got it

625
00:56:12,220 --> 00:56:16,620
to a certain extent. But you don't know about the 10th Amendment, so it's gone. You don't

626
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:20,580
know about the 4th, so it's gone. You don't know much about the 1st.

627
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:23,940
You know it's about freedom of speech. I'm talking to new listeners. You know it's about

628
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:31,180
freedom of religion, assembly, protest, redress of grievances. Government can make no law

629
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:38,500
respecting religion. That's why Southwestern Indians can take all the hallucinogens they

630
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:42,740
ever want and nobody can arrest them, because it's part of their religion.

631
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:46,600
You don't have to agree with it. I don't have to agree with it. But they've got freedom

632
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:51,460
of religion. So the Supreme Court ruled back in the 50s, the Hopi Indians could take peyote

633
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:57,500
because that'd been their religion for thousands of years. So how is government then regulating

634
00:56:57,500 --> 00:57:01,620
churches and saying they can't be involved in politics or they can't say they're against

635
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:02,900
gun control?

636
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:09,140
That's all a hoax. It's all a giant hoax. It's all illegal to have troops on the streets.

637
00:57:09,140 --> 00:57:13,860
It's all illegal to have warrantless checkpoints. And remember, I told you over and over again

638
00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:18,680
that was coming and I was a kook. It didn't exist, even when I had the documents. Now

639
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:23,260
it's here. Now will you believe me about the next phase or we lose everything?

640
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:26,920
I'm gonna come back and go to more of your calls and then I'll get to that Hello Kitty

641
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:31,000
bubble gun piece we did. It's satire, but it's not really satire because it's what's

642
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:38,820
really is happening. I'm gonna get to Switzerland and some of the things that are happening

643
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:45,500
there with the Davos Forum and what the president of Iceland has done to the banksters.

644
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:50,940
Really key clip there. Big next two hours coming up. Briefly, you heard the last guy

645
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:57,180
who's disabled and he says, I support the Infowar by buying your ball caps, your t-shirts,

646
00:57:57,180 --> 00:57:58,180
even though I don't have the money.

647
00:57:58,180 --> 00:58:02,180
You know what? I'm gonna tell somebody like that. It's good to get a t-shirt because then

648
00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:06,700
you can wear it and meet like minded people and educate folks when they ask what is Infowars.

649
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:14,100
But I'm gonna tell you, some of our biggest supporters are people who don't have anything

650
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:16,660
and we do have great products and things. So if you're gonna buy the products, buy them

651
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:21,420
from us anyways. But you know what? The middle class, the wealthy people, you're going to

652
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:26,680
lose everything if you don't start supporting the real media.

653
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:31,420
And it's up to people like that to buy 100 copies of a film and hand them out or to do

654
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:35,420
things like that. And they are supporting us. So that's how we're able to do what we

655
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:38,780
do. But be sure and support us at infowarsstore.com.

00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:51,100

657
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:55,940
Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive from natural disasters

658
00:58:55,940 --> 00:59:00,540
like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on

659
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:05,620
by a disastrous economy? Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything. At eFoods

660
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:09,740

661
00:59:09,740 --> 00:59:14,260

662
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:19,020
wrote, almost all of the grocery stores are closed, but I managed to get my eFoods just

663
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:24,700
in time to be able to help my sister and niece. It is better to be prepared 10 years too early

664
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:29,280
than one day too late. I can warn you, but I can't feed you. Heed the warnings and do

Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.

669
01:00:05,740 --> 01:00:12,740
Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does

he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.

671
01:00:22,540 --> 01:00:26,340
All right, I've gotten into a cross-section of some of the most important news, but I'm

672
01:00:26,340 --> 01:00:30,300
going to drill into it more in-depth at the bottom of the hour. Then we'll continue with

673
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:34,460
calls. We're going to premiere a couple of video pieces here in a moment as well and

674
01:00:34,460 --> 01:00:42,180
get into what's happening at Davos Forum. But right now, let's go ahead and talk to

675
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:47,500
more of the callers here. Let's talk to John in Texas. John, you're on the air. Welcome.

676
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:56,060
You can't have no power. Folks don't know radio is delayed like 10 seconds, so that

677
01:00:56,060 --> 01:01:00,420
always happens. Or he's listening on an iPhone app or something. Hey, John, you there in

678
01:01:00,420 --> 01:01:02,580
Texas, buddy? You want to talk about drones and terror?

679
01:01:02,580 --> 01:01:06,820
Sorry. Yes, sir. I'm sorry about that. Somebody stopped me here.

680
01:01:06,820 --> 01:01:09,420
It's okay. We don't need to have a long discussion about it. Go ahead.

681
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:15,380
Okay, yes, sir. I was going to ask you if you saw the Nova special on drones. It was

682
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:22,860
all aired about a week ago. And I just thought the way they were dehumanizing people by calling

683
01:01:22,860 --> 01:01:27,260
an attack on someone over, I mean, it was in another country, but they were practicing

684
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:33,100
here. They called the attacks flashes. And I just thought they're dehumanizing people

685
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:34,100
with that.

686
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:38,940
Well, no, of course, all the terms were human resources. We're flashes. We're not even the

687
01:01:38,940 --> 01:01:44,340
target. We're a flash in the pan. All of this, and then they've got Prince Harry in the news

688
01:01:44,340 --> 01:01:50,700
every day. He could taste the blood. He loves to kill. It's like a game. He's such a man.

689
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:55,660
They're training us not to have empathy with each other. So that the new robot armies and

690
01:01:55,660 --> 01:02:00,220
that's not just me saying that the British Ministry of Defense came out and said, yeah,

691
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:01,940
these are gonna be the robot wars.

692
01:02:01,940 --> 01:02:08,020
Our tax money, it's not just in the sky. It's drone submarines, drone ships, drone tanks,

693
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:14,620
drone cars, drone trucks, drone insects. This is why government's so arrogant. But they

694
01:02:14,620 --> 01:02:21,180
know our projectile weapons, cuz there's billions of us, hundreds of millions here in the US,

695
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:22,980
will be able to resist them.

696
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:28,640
They've done the actuaries. So that's why they wanna get our guns before they turn Skynet

697
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:29,640
loose on us.

698
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:34,620
Well, it was actually splash. I'm sorry, it wasn't flash. They called it a splash. And

699
01:02:34,620 --> 01:02:38,580
I thought, wow, they're just dehumanizing the targets while they're sitting over there

700
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:39,580
for a little while.

701
01:02:39,580 --> 01:02:43,660
I've seen the nomenclature. There's a bunch of terms they use. In fact, a lot of articles

702
01:02:43,660 --> 01:02:48,220
have been written about it. Let me look up. What do they call a drone kill? I thought

703
01:02:48,220 --> 01:02:50,900
it was something else entirely. Go ahead.

704
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:56,980
Yes, sir. Well, no, they were showing these young men sitting over there in their Air

705
01:02:56,980 --> 01:03:01,340
Force uniforms in these little air conditioned pods. I forgot what Air Force base it was.

706
01:03:01,340 --> 01:03:05,780
But they're just sitting there controlling it like a video game. And they said, oh, that's

707
01:03:05,780 --> 01:03:11,500
a good splash right there. And it was a human being being blown to bits. And they actually

708
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:15,620
showed some of the videos from I think it was Iraq or Afghanistan. I'm not sure which.

709
01:03:15,620 --> 01:03:21,300
But you know, Nova was just going along like, oh, yes, this is just so wonderful.

710
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:25,940
But I did have another point. I wanted to ask you if you've ever heard of a man named

711
01:03:25,940 --> 01:03:26,940
Waleed Shubat.

712
01:03:26,940 --> 01:03:27,940
No, I haven't.

713
01:03:27,940 --> 01:03:37,100
He wrote a book called God's War on Terror. And he's a former Muslim terrorist. And anyway,

714
01:03:37,100 --> 01:03:43,020
I just thought he would be a really good interview for you to have him on. He basically the conversion

715
01:03:43,020 --> 01:03:47,300
that he had to Christianity was amazing. I mean, because he was a full blown I mean,

716
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:52,900
he was, you know, killing people for Islam. But you really ought to read that book God's

717
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:53,900
War on Terror.

718
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:56,500
No, I hear you. I will certainly look into it. Thank you for the call. And God bless

719
01:03:56,500 --> 01:04:00,980
you, sir. Glad you got on. For TV viewers, if we punch up my search here, I typed in

720
01:04:00,980 --> 01:04:08,340
autonomous drones. And you can see something new to worry about. Murderous autonomous drones.

721
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:12,980
Here's Nextgov. Autonomous drones pose no technology changes or challenges for the Navy.

722
01:04:12,980 --> 01:04:19,420
US military test first autonomous drone. Folks, they've had autonomous space plane drones

723
01:04:19,420 --> 01:04:21,620
in the skies since the 60s and 70s.

724
01:04:21,620 --> 01:04:29,220
I mean, this is just ridiculous. But I was reading one out of England yesterday. It's

725
01:04:29,220 --> 01:04:35,540
called the new tyrannous drone, which means tyranny. What a perfect name for it. Just

726
01:04:35,540 --> 01:04:41,140
absolutely disgusting. And again, this cuts the military out of it so that humans can't

727
01:04:41,140 --> 01:04:43,940
say no to carry on an unlawful order.

728
01:04:43,940 --> 01:04:49,980
An 18 wheeler pulls up that's robot driven. The backslides down and 15 combat robots get

729
01:04:49,980 --> 01:04:54,860
off the back. And they've got nerve gas. They've got weapons. They've got lasers. They've got

730
01:04:54,860 --> 01:04:58,820
everything. And the globalists sit back and kill you and your family. And it's autonomous.

731
01:04:58,820 --> 01:05:03,980
It's not even an operator.

732

01:06:04,180 --> 01:06:09,740
lovers. The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse. The

742
01:06:09,740 --> 01:06:15,780
globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce

743
01:06:15,780 --> 01:06:19,900

We've got an incredible breaking story up at infowars.com right now. Washington Post

766
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:41,000
report. The new Secretary of Defense nominee Hagel warned Obama about a new world order.

Secretary of Defense nominee pointed to rogue elements within the military. Find out about

768

that right now at prisonplanet.com and infowars.com. We'll get to it in a moment. DHS boss trampling

769
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:58,040
a posse commentatis at National Police Confab openly says just the main threat is gun owners

770
01:08:58,040 --> 01:09:00,400
and that that's what Homeland Security is for.

771
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:05,840
Chinese Communist Party mouthpiece demands Obama disarm Americans again. The official

772
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:11,840
People's Daily. That is just some of the news. US Army runs drills in Houston. They ran drills

773
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:18,060
two nights ago in Miami. This is all to condition everyone to accept martial law. Amazing photos

774
01:09:18,060 --> 01:09:25,040
in this article up at infowars.com. Backfire. Seattle gun buyback turns into gun show. Collectors

775
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:28,080
waved wads of cash at those in line.

776
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:33,200
Yeah, I've seen some of the purdy shotguns that are literally worth like $10,000 apiece.

777
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:37,160
I've seen this on the news. You'll see an old woman. It's generally old women when they're

778
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:41,300
when they're old World War Two vet or Korean War vet husband dies. These poor women have

779
01:09:41,300 --> 01:09:48,640
no idea these firearms. Even old 22s are worth 300 bucks. Gear rifles, 500 bucks. You'll

780
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:56,680
see him turning in carved shotguns that are worth $3,000, $5,000, $10,000.

781
01:09:56,680 --> 01:10:00,760
And the cops are there salivating. That's why they constantly catch police. You see

782
01:10:00,760 --> 01:10:05,480
it in the news all the time. Shelling gun buyback guns. I'm not for police corruption.

783
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:10,660
In fact, I hate it. But let me tell you something. I don't blame them. I mean, you're gonna turn

784
01:10:10,660 --> 01:10:17,400
over like an AR-15 that's worth $2,000 to be run over by a steamroller? You're gonna

785
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:23,980
turn over a purdy $10,000 shotgun because some idiot came and got $100 or a $50 gift

786
01:10:23,980 --> 01:10:24,980
card for it?

787
01:10:24,980 --> 01:10:30,040
I mean, man, I watched those videos of them melting down and steamrolling those guns.

788
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:35,520
It makes me sick. They are so valuable. And people paid money for those. And I've checked

789
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:40,580
the MO. A few years ago, Austinites, we ought to find the clip. What's old is new and add

790
01:10:40,580 --> 01:10:46,800
it to this article. Austinites went out. Memory serves, I think it was that guy named John

791
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:47,800
Bush.

792
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:51,480
And he's got what, Texas for Accountable Government. I think that, if memory serves that's who

793
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:56,840
did it. They went out and would try to buy the guns back and actually did. And the police

794
01:10:56,840 --> 01:11:00,600
go, we don't like it, but it's legal if it's a private sale.

795
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:08,800
Just amazing photos up there. And just extremely painful to watch. Now, a lot of margins total

796
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:13,200
junker guns that don't even work and people are just getting $100 or whatever. But still,

797
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:17,720
it's to create the image of guns being handed in.

798
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:24,040
Yeah, there it is. First ever Austinites outbid police in gun buyback counter program. That

799
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:34,720
was in February of 2011, so a while back. All right, ladies and gentlemen, now let's

800
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:40,960
continue here with some of the other news that is coming up.

801
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:46,040
We're gonna get into five year old girl suspended for terroristic threat to shoot classmates

802
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:50,040
with pink bubble. We're gonna do that here in just a moment. But first off, let me give

803
01:11:50,040 --> 01:12:01,560
you the toll free number to join us, 800-259-9231. Now, you see the reports every day where somebody's

804
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:04,440
playing with a Nerf gun in their front yard and the police are called.

805
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:09,800
A pink, orange, blue, bright colored guns, yellow, orange, you name it. My kids have

806
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:15,160
all got them. Your children have them probably. Or you read about a kid says bang bang with

807
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:22,240
their fingers and then the SWAT team comes. Or every day or two, someone talks about,

808
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:27,200
hey, let's go play with our Nerf guns after school.

809
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:31,720
And the SWAT team is called and everybody panics. This is the hysteria. People aren't

810
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:37,120
panicking over going to the hospital where 190 something thousand die a year from infections,

811
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:42,680
close to 200,000 die from bad drug interactions. 40 something thousand die from car wrecks.

812
01:12:42,680 --> 01:12:48,040
What is it, like 400 and something thousand from alcohol abuse? No, no, all those real

813
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:53,400
things that are dangerous, huge numbers die from falling and hitting their head in the

814
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:55,560
shower, dying in the pool.

815
01:12:55,560 --> 01:13:01,160
The pool is, last time I checked, I forget, it's just astronomically more dangerous than

816
01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:06,360
guns in your house. A pool is like super deadly, better have a fence around it. Cuz your little

817
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:09,680
kids out there, even they're a good swimmer, they fall, hit their head, they're dead. You

818
01:13:09,680 --> 01:13:15,120
pull in from work, your child's dead. A creek behind your house, good way to die, but still

819
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:19,880
I'm not saying don't live by a creek, I do, it's a good way to die.

820
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:24,200
That creek behind my house is, you can pull up the numbers. I wanna say it's something

821
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:29,320
like 70 something times more dangerous than a gun in the house. The point is, it's all

822
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:33,680
in the world almanac, you can look up these numbers. Being near a water source that's

823
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:38,480
deeper than a foot deep, people die all the time hitting their head and falling in a puddle.

824
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:43,420
They are super deadly. The point is, it's total and complete absolute hysteria. FBI

825
01:13:43,420 --> 01:13:51,600
crime statistics gathered from 18,000 jurisdictions, 49% drop in violent crime since 1991. 49%

826
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:58,480
drop, 21 points of that has accelerated since 07. We've done the official breakdowns, our

827
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:01,000
videos are up at infoawards.com.

828
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:05,460
It's called the gun statistics Obama doesn't want you to see. We show fbi.gov, we crack

829
01:14:05,460 --> 01:14:10,040
the numbers right there, what they don't want you to know. So you'd think they'd be, hey,

830
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:16,680
look, more guns, less crime, no, no, no. They have such hysteria now that you are not allowed

831
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:20,680
to play dodgeball because it's aggressive, you're not allowed to jog or wrestle during

832
01:14:20,680 --> 01:14:21,680
recess.

833
01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:26,520
Now you're not allowed to even shake hands at most government training centers. These

834
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:34,080
are the equivalent of medium security presence. And then there's this article, this article

835
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:43,500
up on infoawards.com from last week. Five-year-old girl suspended for terroristic threat to shoot

836
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:53,500
classmates with pink bubble gun, with pink bubble gun, with pink bubble gun.

837
01:14:53,500 --> 01:15:03,560
And the little girls said after school we ought to get our bubble projectors. And I've

838
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:06,840
actually bought these for party favors for one of my daughters when they're friends at

839
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:14,320
a party. And the girl was brought in three different times with police, was expelled,

840
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:15,920
and they called it terrorism.

841
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:20,240
Okay, this is the reality. And now there's a new article that's red linked that just

842
01:15:20,240 --> 01:15:27,100
went up. This is not the one last week. This is the new one this week. Discussion about

843
01:15:27,100 --> 01:15:33,800
toy nerf gun causes lockdown at Bronx Elementary School. What did the Attorney General say?

844
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:38,600
He goes, we need to demonize guns where people have a phobia of them, literally brainwash

845
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:42,000
people against guns.

846
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,280
And they know kids are getting into these nerf guns. We have great wars with them all

847
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:49,120
the time. The only problem with the nerf guns is they break so easily. It's talking

848
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:53,120
about planned obsolescence to rip you off. Probably about ten of these things for each

849
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:55,720
child in the last five, six years cuz they're constantly breaking.

850
01:15:55,720 --> 01:16:00,080
The point is, is they have a lot of really fun systems. We play laser tag too. And their

851
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:05,120
friends come over and play laser tag in the backyard. This is such a hysteria that they're

852
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:10,160
now pressuring retailers not to sell these. They're now saying, my gosh, the symbol of

853
01:16:10,160 --> 01:16:11,160
a gun.

854
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:15,080
And they've done this in areas of Europe. They banned toy guns, then they banned the

855
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:21,040
real guns. Many jurisdictions in the US have actually banned BB guns because there's no

856
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:26,400
lobby to protect BB guns in the jurisdiction, but guns are legal. You see, cuz there's no

857
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:28,000
lobby to defend them.

858
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:33,480
This is a new case. Discussion about toy nerf gun causes lockdown at Bronx Elementary School.

859
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:38,480
Hysteria, police with assault rifles, helicopters, hunted for non-existent object as parents

860
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:43,360
panicked. It's always been their plan to get your kids, get them in a public school, have

861
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:48,420
mass shooter drills, stage mass shootings, provocateur mass shootings, hype up mass shootings

862
01:16:48,420 --> 01:16:54,800
for copycats, and then just create absolute hysteria and fear.

863
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:59,040
Where you see it all the time where some guy puts his deer rifle in the back of his car,

864
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:04,160
even in rural areas to go shooting, and somebody driving by sees a gun being put in the trunk.

865
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:09,840
I mean, that's why no one dare put a gun in their gun rack. You'd be swatting so fast

866
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:14,600
your head would spin. See how they've conditioned us to, let's hide our guns, while they sit

867
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:17,480
there and operate and imply that guns are totally illegal.

868
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:22,200
A discussion between two children about a toy nerf gun caused a lockdown and a massive

869
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:26,680
armed police response as two elementary schools in the Bronx today. And yet another example

870
01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:31,440
of how hysteria is sweeping American education system in the aftermath of Sandy Hook shooting.

871
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:34,360
That's artificial hysteria.

872
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:39,080
Parents rushed to two schools in Fulton Avenue and East 174th Street. And CNN had it and

873
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:43,240
it wasn't happening again, again, a way to reconjure the fear. Like when a gas main blows

874
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:47,840
up or a steam main in New York, they shut down half the city and earn fear. Today, after

875
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:51,280
heavily armed police were called to reports of a gun on campus.

876
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:56,760
The alarm was caused by a campus aide overhearing a student say something about a gun. It's

877
01:17:56,760 --> 01:18:03,000
the word gun, except government's armed, black uniforms, helicopters, Delta Force raids,

878
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:10,960
checkpoints, open borders, 57,000 dead, hundreds of heads chopped off a year in Texas and Arizona,

879
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:15,320
mass death killing. That's no issue, don't worry about a real crisis, killed more people

880
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:18,600
than died in the ten years of Vietnam, just the last five and a half, six years.

881
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:21,440
No, no, no, we're gonna skip this network break, cuz I gotta have time to play this

882
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:27,360
piece and then go to your calls. All of this is going on, all of this is happening. And

883
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:35,840
it is clear, total, and complete mind control. That's what it is. And that's why, in fact,

884
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:37,360
I'm gonna do a piece on it.

885
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:41,600
Will somebody grab me that Lego over there? I can't get to it, thank you, it's right there.

886
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:48,880
Last week, the Turkish Association of Austria, yeah, it's just right there in the corner.

887
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:51,520
The door's locked again, I'm gonna have a lock taken off that door, I'm not locking

888
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:55,480
it. I don't know what keeps happening, but whatever. Anyways, getting back to what I

889
01:18:55,480 --> 01:19:00,720
was breaking down here, they came out and said the Jabba the Hutt is supposed to be

890
01:19:00,720 --> 01:19:01,720
an Arab and is racist.

891
01:19:01,720 --> 01:19:06,480
And there's talk of suing Lego and the Austrian government's very concerned. You go, well,

892
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:10,400
that's ridiculous. Jabba the Hutt has nothing to do with Arabs and Legos, I mean, what is

893
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:16,120
this? Or Muslims. It's about, hey, if you don't give your guns up, you're a racist.

894
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:20,860
You're like, well, I guess I'm not a racist, here's my guns. It's meant to be asinine,

895
01:19:20,860 --> 01:19:26,000
it's meant to be over the top, it's meant to be ridiculous, it's meant to be out of

896
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:29,580
control, it's meant to be ridiculously sickening.

897
01:19:29,580 --> 01:19:35,720
It's meant to just absolutely get you to do whatever ridiculous order you're told. In

898
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:40,640
fact, they phased this out because it's sub-politically incorrect. But the Marine Corps, what you

899
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:46,760
see in films like Full Metal Jacket, most of that was impromptu cuz the guy they hired

900
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:52,680
to play the drill instructor really was a drill instructor, and in the Marines as well.

901
01:19:52,680 --> 01:19:58,940
And so grabbing their genitals, marching around for an hour, basically masturbating or getting

902
01:19:58,940 --> 01:20:03,880
close to it, saying this is my rifle, this is my gun, this is for fighting, this is for

903
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:09,640
fun. And sleeping with their rifles, giving it a woman's name, and basically telling them,

904
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:13,440
you're supposed to, I only wanna get into the secrets of the Marine Corps, it's pretty

905
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:14,440
weird.

906
01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:19,160
And a lot of it's been phased out the last 20 years. The point is, is it was meant to

907
01:20:19,160 --> 01:20:24,000
be done to just, people didn't wanna do it. They said, listen, you're gonna hump on your

908
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:31,200
rifle or you're not in the Marine Corps. You're gonna do what you're told, is that clear scumbag?

909
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:34,720
And if we tell you to go beat people up, we're gonna do it. In the old days of the Marine

910
01:20:34,720 --> 01:20:38,600
Corps, people who didn't play ball, you didn't get beat up with soap, folks, they killed

911
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:39,600
you.

912
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:44,120
They'd send you out going over a gorge or something, and they just cut the rope, and

913
01:20:44,120 --> 01:20:48,000
then everybody would be part of the blood cement, the cover up of killing the person

914
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:53,200
that gave people problems. That's the real Marine Corps, folks. You know why the Marine

915
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:57,320
Corps has been known worldwide for being so tough, and why even the Nazis feared them?

916
01:20:57,320 --> 01:21:01,960
The Nazis killed people in training too, because that's what you did. The devil dogs killed

917
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:07,680
people in training. People died in every class generally, okay? You can actually go look

918
01:21:07,680 --> 01:21:09,520
it up historically, it's been leaked.

919
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:15,680
But anyways, I'm digressing. This whole thing is about mind control. If I tell you to get

920
01:21:15,680 --> 01:21:21,480
your rifle and to start rolling around in bed with it, you're gonna do it, is that clear?

921
01:21:21,480 --> 01:21:26,680
Okay? And it's the same thing. If I tell you you're going to jail or the SWAT team's coming

922
01:21:26,680 --> 01:21:31,520
because you drew a picture of a gun, or you said the word gun, you're gonna happen.

923
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:36,840
You're not gonna have a Hello Kitty bubble gun. Do you understand that? Do you get that

924
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:42,640
through your stinking head, is that clear? Do you get that through your head? If we tell

925
01:21:42,640 --> 01:21:48,160
you to walk around in a circle for an hour grabbing your genitals with other men, you're

926
01:21:48,160 --> 01:21:52,480
going to do it, is that clear?

927
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:57,720
The ancients would say, you will give us your child to be sacrificed. Every culture, the

928
01:21:57,720 --> 01:22:05,200
Druids, the Aztecs, the Babylonians, all cultures, the Greeks had human sacrifice. Most are subcultures

929
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:12,100
in city states. When you're ordered to kill people, you're gonna do it. And what's the

930
01:22:12,100 --> 01:22:14,160
ultimate thing government can demand?

931
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:19,680
Give us your first born to be chopped open, to be burned in a fire, to be put inside a

932
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:24,160
wicker man and burned. The priest class had such control in most cultures, they would

933
01:22:24,160 --> 01:22:32,680
routinely demand a prince be killed or even the king be killed. And again, I know this

934
01:22:32,680 --> 01:22:41,360
all sounds wild, history is wild, history is crazy. Full metal jacket with them walking

935
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:50,000
around sleeping with their M14, with them grabbing their genitals.

936
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:56,640
That's what goes on and then some. And again, you're like, well, that's ridiculous. No,

937
01:22:56,640 --> 01:23:02,280
it's about doing what you're told, following orders no matter what it is. Training the

938
01:23:02,280 --> 01:23:07,200
men that if a hand grenade gets thrown, whoever's closest to it jumps on it, so that the rest

939
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:13,600
of the unit lives. You're like, well, that's suicide. That's kamikaze. Exactly, ladies

940
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:15,880
and gentlemen, it's total programming.

941
01:23:15,880 --> 01:23:19,720
And the whole culture is a giant reeducation camp. Now here's the piece, if you wanna see

942
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:23,980
the video as a radio listener, it's up at infoawars.com. We put out an earlier piece

943
01:23:23,980 --> 01:23:28,260
with this last week and people said, they're not sending police for bubble guns. This is

944
01:23:28,260 --> 01:23:33,940
based on true stories. This piece put together by the crew, we did this in one take live

945
01:23:33,940 --> 01:23:37,760
and then added Melissa Melton's comments to the beginning of it. Along with clips of real

946
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:43,880
newscast where people are getting arrested or detained or expelled for toy guns.

947
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:52,640
Here it is. Citizens of the homeland. We here at the ministry apologize for the disturbing

948
01:23:52,640 --> 01:23:59,040
footage you are about to see. The extremist Alec Jones has been permanently detained under

949
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:07,880
the NDAA for an armed rampage with a bubble gun. Such behavior will not be tolerated.

950
01:24:07,880 --> 01:24:13,720
Citizens everywhere are vigilantly reporting other criminals and their terroristic weapons,

951
01:24:13,720 --> 01:24:20,560
such as plastic toy guns, guns drawn by hand on paper. And yes, even the vicious Hello

952
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:27,460
Kitty bubble gun. Should you see children so armed, be sure to report them and their

953
01:24:27,460 --> 01:24:32,440
parents to the homeland for immediate rendition and reeducation.

954
01:24:32,440 --> 01:24:38,680
Remember citizens, the founding fathers were pig enemies of the state. The people are the

955
01:24:38,680 --> 01:24:45,440
true threat. Government force is freedom. We must thank God for the superstate and do

956
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:51,080
not worry as we have armed ourselves with over 1.6 billion bullets, fully automatic

957
01:24:51,080 --> 01:24:59,280
weapons and armored checkpoints. The homeland is here to keep you safe. Trust no one else.

958
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:05,920
Soon we will be one absorbed into the great collective until they continue to be vigilant.

959
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:11,440
And if you see something, say something. We bring you now this graphic footage of Alex

960
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:16,580
Jones bubble gun rampage in its entirety. This is Melissa Melton with the Department

961
01:25:16,580 --> 01:25:23,360
of Homeland Security out. Hi, I'm Janet Napolitano, Secretary of the

962
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:30,000
Department of Homeland Security. Homeland Security begins with hometown security.

963
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,640
You're rolling? Yeah.

964
01:25:32,640 --> 01:25:36,760
Okay. I want to thank everybody for coming here for the staff meeting. Alex will be joining

965
01:25:36,760 --> 01:25:40,440
us in just a few minutes. I'd like to thank my new assistant, Rob Dougal, who's been demoted

966
01:25:40,440 --> 01:25:44,480
for this purpose. Now I have a few stories I'd like to go over, but first, Darren McBreen,

967
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:47,480
what do you have there? Well, it's kind of interesting that the Chinese

968
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:52,080
government recommends that our government starts confiscating-

969
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:59,160
Hold on, I'm sorry I'm late. Look at this. Alex, check it out, man. We've got that office

970
01:25:59,160 --> 01:26:02,720
party and, you know, I gave presents to all the kids at the Christmas party. I think that

971
01:26:02,720 --> 01:26:08,720
office party is coming up. I'm thinking we'll have these as party papers. Check this out.

972
01:26:08,720 --> 01:26:18,560
The bubble touches me. You're going to be arrested for assault. Do you understand me?

973
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:22,280
Bubbles. Alex, I have this article right here. That's

974
01:26:22,280 --> 01:26:26,980
a bubble gun. A five-year-old girl was suspended after a terroristic threat when she brought

975
01:26:26,980 --> 01:26:32,620
a pink bubble gun, just like that. Was this the weapon of choice for a new kind

976
01:26:32,620 --> 01:26:39,800
of terrorist? Terror by bubbles. The small pink Hello Kitty toy gun is an automatic bubble

977
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:45,080
blower. But just days ago, when a five-year-old girl said she and a classmate should shoot

978
01:26:45,080 --> 01:26:50,200
each other with bubbles, the school called it a terrorist threat.

979
01:26:50,200 --> 01:26:52,200
What is this, a prank or something? Or someone's going to be having a meeting.

980
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:54,200
That's a bubble gun. You can't have that stuff, Alex.

981
01:26:54,200 --> 01:26:57,200
Is that a spooky? You can't bring that around, Alex.

982
01:26:57,200 --> 01:27:02,720
That is a fully automatic bubble gun. Listen, Jigar, I know you're joking. There's

983
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:04,960
no story. All right, look, Alex, hold on, hold on. Let

984
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:07,480
me talk to Melissa. Melissa, what's going on? I don't know what's going on.

985
01:27:07,480 --> 01:27:09,480
That's a bubble gun. They were almost arrested in elementary school

986
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:14,320
girl last week for having a paper gun in school. Well, Thomas, this is all about a fifth grader

987
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:18,920
that brought a piece of paper to class that many say looked like a gun. And it's what

988
01:27:18,920 --> 01:27:24,160
happened next that has her family crying foul. She pulled out a paper gun last week and says

989
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:29,320
an administrator scolded her in front of the class. Her mom says staff even searched her

990
01:27:29,320 --> 01:27:34,480
with other kids watching the whole time. That's that's what is this about a bubble

991
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:40,760
gun? The have a kitty thing? Yes. I thought that was a joke. It's not a joke.

992
01:27:40,760 --> 01:27:45,000
This is not a joke. Terroristic threat. The school took this so seriously that administrators

993
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:49,200
even ordered that the five year old receive a psychological evaluation.

994
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:55,680
Alex, I'm not going to be subjected to this. It's a detergent. Come on, it's a bubble gun.

995
01:27:55,680 --> 01:28:01,120
If that detergent gets in my eye, I'm in. That's assault. Turn it off, turn it off.

996
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:04,560
It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. We're going to back that up because we have real

997
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:08,900
clips of cops where people have bubbles and flowers about peace and love. And the cops

998
01:28:08,900 --> 01:28:13,200
are like, if that touches us, you're going to jail for assault with detergent.

999
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:17,720
And even some of the cops are laughing. I mean, it's just this mental illness where

1000
01:28:17,720 --> 01:28:22,040
the public's bad, the government's good. And so we're actually reenacting what now happens

1001
01:28:22,040 --> 01:28:26,400
in America, where I have a bubble gun and everyone is just shaking in fear. Again, you

1002
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:30,720
shake in fear at bubble gums. But whenever black helicopters come out of the sky or there's

1003
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:32,920
a checkpoint, now that's freedom.

1004
01:28:32,920 --> 01:28:37,320
You're supposed to be scared of that. That's North Korea. But no, that's a good thing.

1005
01:28:37,320 --> 01:28:42,040
But citizens with a bubble gun or a Nerf gun, save me, government. Let's go back to the

1006
01:28:42,040 --> 01:28:48,760
clip touches me.

1007
01:28:48,760 --> 01:28:56,800
I have a bubble gun. A five year old girl was suspended after a terroristic threat when

1008
01:28:56,800 --> 01:29:00,320
she brought a pink bubble gun just like that.

1009
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:06,200
Was this the weapon of choice for a new kind of terrorists? Terror by bubbles. The small

1010
01:29:06,200 --> 01:29:12,440
pink Hello Kitty toy gun is an automatic bubble blower. But just days ago, when a five year

1011
01:29:12,440 --> 01:29:20,120
old girl said she and a classmate should shoot each other with bubbles, a terrorist threat.

1012
01:29:20,120 --> 01:29:24,320
That's about half the report. The end is really the best part, but it's really visual. So

1013
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:30,160
if you're a radio listener, go to info wars dot com. It's in the tiles up there. Man goes

1014
01:29:30,160 --> 01:29:35,180
on bubble gum rampage caught on tape. And you can see where they call 911 on me, which

1015
01:29:35,180 --> 01:29:36,760
really goes on in the real world.

1016
01:29:36,760 --> 01:29:41,020
We're illustrating this, reenacting it for the vicious bubble gun. But foreign banks

1017
01:29:41,020 --> 01:29:45,640
running things and saying they're gonna kill the dollar. That's not a threat. Bubble guns.

1018
01:29:45,640 --> 01:29:48,880
That's the real threat. Don't be worried about big government. Our founders said be worried

1019
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:50,600
about it. They were bad.

1020
01:29:50,600 --> 01:30:01,160
We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.

1021
01:30:01,160 --> 01:30:05,240

1057
01:33:46,680 --> 01:34:03,280
all in. We are back. I am your host, Alex Jones. Thank you so much for joining us. Okay,

1058
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:08,680
let's race through a bunch of your calls right now. Then I'll get to the top story at infowars.com.

1059
01:34:08,680 --> 01:34:15,760
Washington Post reporter Hagel warned Obama about New World Order. Secretary of Defense

1060
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:22,480
nominee pointed to rogue elements within the military. So again, they call a New World

1061
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:27,160
Order anything that isn't their system. They want a new system of global government. They

1062
01:34:27,160 --> 01:34:29,120
call that a New World Order.

1063
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:33,480
Then Ahmadinejad says, I want a Muslim New World Order, a Shiite New World Order. And

1064
01:34:33,480 --> 01:34:40,560
then the Saudis say we want a Wahhabist New World Order. Putin says he wants a Russian

1065
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:45,240
centric New World Order. The communist Chinese say we want a Chinese New World Order. Well,

1066
01:34:45,240 --> 01:34:49,800
now they're worried that the military can't be trusted. Remember Panetta? I think I'm

1067
01:34:49,800 --> 01:34:51,960
gonna have Steve add this to his article.

1068
01:34:51,960 --> 01:34:59,400
Panetta last year wouldn't go to bases around even US officers if they had weapons. Never

1069
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:05,160
in US history has the Secretary of Defense or a top general not wanted to be around the

1070
01:35:05,160 --> 01:35:12,240
troops with guns. A little bit in Vietnam, some of the mid-level officers started really

1071
01:35:12,240 --> 01:35:17,040
getting concerned with something they could do about being fragged. Wow, just incredible.

1072
01:35:17,040 --> 01:35:23,720
We're gonna be getting to that. It's all overwhelming here. We're gonna have news blitz in the third

1073
01:35:23,720 --> 01:35:25,120
hour coming up as well.

1074
01:35:25,120 --> 01:35:32,080
Right now, let's go to, how do you pronounce that? Reginaldo? Reginaldo. You know what's

1075
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:37,580
happening? I've always had 2015 vision. Undoubtedly, when we move that screen all the way to the

1076
01:35:37,580 --> 01:35:40,520
end of the wall, I just can't read it anymore.

1077
01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:45,920
So I need to, we've talked about this before. I need a bigger television set with the collars

1078
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:51,120
on it. Cuz see, I could run the collars myself and sit here and hit the buttons, but then

1079
01:35:51,120 --> 01:35:54,840
that gets distracting. But it almost gets more distracting if I'm not. Maybe I should

1080
01:35:54,840 --> 01:36:00,720
just have the computer put in the front of the table here, like regular radio, and then

1081
01:36:00,720 --> 01:36:07,280
I go to the calls right here cuz, or I could unplug that monitor and then that would make

1082
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:08,520
us get a big TV in there.

1083
01:36:08,520 --> 01:36:15,560
I don't know. Who did you say it was again? Reginald in Tennessee, you're on the air,

1084
01:36:15,560 --> 01:36:16,560
go ahead.

1085
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:23,520
Hello, my name is actually Reginald Cook. And I would like to speak to you about some

1086
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:28,160
of the things you've mentioned because I studied as a barrister in, I suppose you can tell

1087
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:31,160
I'm not actually from Tennessee. Can you guess where I'm from?

1088
01:36:31,160 --> 01:36:34,640
I can guess that you're from Britannia.

1089
01:36:34,640 --> 01:36:35,640
Well how did you know?

1090
01:36:35,640 --> 01:36:38,720
Sounds like your voice, it sounds like a fake accent, buddy.

1091
01:36:38,720 --> 01:36:43,800
That's not actually. I'm actually from Sussex. But I've been in the States for 10 years.

1092
01:36:43,800 --> 01:36:47,520
Well welcome, welcome, welcome. What's on your mind today?

1093
01:36:47,520 --> 01:36:54,520
Well, the thing is, I don't agree with everything you say, but I do agree with certain aspects

1094
01:36:54,520 --> 01:37:01,080
of it. That would be that certain peoples are trying to manipulate governments and market

1095
01:37:01,080 --> 01:37:02,080
them.

1096
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:05,680
No, no, there's no special interests. That's another conspiracy, there is.

1097
01:37:05,680 --> 01:37:11,240
Well unfortunately, I've seen laws change. You see, as I said, I studied to be a barrister,

1098
01:37:11,240 --> 01:37:12,240
a lawyer.

1099
01:37:12,240 --> 01:37:15,240
Well don't worry, once we turn our guns in, the government's gonna take real good care

1100
01:37:15,240 --> 01:37:17,640
of us. They're good people.

1101
01:37:17,640 --> 01:37:20,360
This is not what happened in England, actually.

1102
01:37:20,360 --> 01:37:23,200
Ah, I'm sorry, go ahead.

1103
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:29,040
Anyway, well the part I disagree with is, of course I understand it, you're an American.

1104
01:37:29,040 --> 01:37:36,440
I don't really disapprove of aristocracy and monarchy. I'm a monarchist, sorry. I've actually

1105
01:37:36,440 --> 01:37:40,640
met a nice aristocrat as well. Mainly the problem is-

1106
01:37:40,640 --> 01:37:42,640
Did they pat you on the head?

1107
01:37:42,640 --> 01:37:45,840
No, actually. Why would they do that?

1108
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:49,240
I don't know, that's what happens to lap dogs.

1109
01:37:49,240 --> 01:37:50,240
I'm not a lap dog.

1110
01:37:50,240 --> 01:37:55,640
All right, I'm gonna stop being mean to you. Look, I get the argument, take UKIP, pro-sovereignty,

1111
01:37:55,640 --> 01:38:00,640
anti-new world order, they're royalist. So I can take the little bit of bad with all

1112
01:38:00,640 --> 01:38:05,640
the good, because they understand the EU is setting itself up as a new royalty.

1113
01:38:05,640 --> 01:38:11,360
They'd rather have the old vestigial monarchy, because at least people think it's British,

1114
01:38:11,360 --> 01:38:16,700
and then have some feeling of patriotism, some basic nationalism. So I actually get

1115
01:38:16,700 --> 01:38:23,740
the subtleties of all of that. It's just that at the heart of so much of the new world order

1116
01:38:23,740 --> 01:38:29,840
we see being pushed, is the Transylvanian royalty that you've got perched over there

1117
01:38:29,840 --> 01:38:30,840
in London.

1118
01:38:30,840 --> 01:38:36,480
It's not actually Transylvanian, it's actually a German family. But at the same time, there

1119
01:38:36,480 --> 01:38:43,400
is British as anyone else that moved to Britain 200 years ago. But that's not the way I called

1120
01:38:43,400 --> 01:38:50,120
in. The point is, I think that, and like I said, the accent's a little-

1121
01:38:50,120 --> 01:38:54,200
You know the German house they hail out of is originally Transylvanian.

1122
01:38:54,200 --> 01:38:58,680
Actually, it's kind of more mixed than that.

1123
01:38:58,680 --> 01:39:04,400
Well, it is mixed, but I mean, one of their oldest bloodlines is Transylvanian, and that's

1124
01:39:04,400 --> 01:39:10,200
the one Prince Charles says he's most proud of. He says he's Transylvanian in news articles,

1125
01:39:10,200 --> 01:39:14,200
and you know he's moved there, and then runs around in the woods.

1126
01:39:14,200 --> 01:39:18,360
On the other hand, I have descended from the Stewarts, so I wouldn't concern myself too

1127
01:39:18,360 --> 01:39:19,360
much.

1128
01:39:19,360 --> 01:39:20,360
Ah, you are a royal.

1129
01:39:20,360 --> 01:39:23,560
No, no, because they were kicked out.

1130
01:39:23,560 --> 01:39:24,960
So you like Henry VIII?

1131
01:39:24,960 --> 01:39:26,880
No, that's the Tudors.

1132
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:30,760
The Stewarts, the Tudors, the Pooters, go ahead.

1133
01:39:30,760 --> 01:39:40,360
The point is, I came to America, actually it was 10 years ago, it's not recent, largely

1134
01:39:40,360 --> 01:39:46,160
because I saw certain changes in law. And those changes weren't based on traditional

1135
01:39:46,160 --> 01:39:51,280
monarchy, they weren't based on traditional British common law, the regular law. They

1136
01:39:51,280 --> 01:39:54,640
were based on something I started learning in college.

1137
01:39:54,640 --> 01:39:59,760
Called Admiralty Law or Administrative Law, and that's what Tony Blair said in like 1997.

1138
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:02,440
He said, we're gonna quote, get rid of Magna Carta.

1139
01:40:02,440 --> 01:40:08,040
What's more than the Magna Carta, they don't even like the monarchy, they don't like anything

1140
01:40:08,040 --> 01:40:09,040
traditionally British.

1141
01:40:09,040 --> 01:40:11,040
No, cuz that's because they're gonna be the new royalty.

1142
01:40:11,040 --> 01:40:17,520
Let me get to the point, please. This is the important part. They don't like people being

1143
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:19,080
British in Britain.

1144
01:40:19,080 --> 01:40:20,080
I agree.

1145
01:40:20,080 --> 01:40:26,840
They don't like people being American in America. Because, and if I can play the villain for

1146
01:40:26,840 --> 01:40:30,520
just a moment, if you don't mind.

1147
01:40:30,520 --> 01:40:32,720
No, please do.

1148
01:40:32,720 --> 01:40:43,040
Okay, it's very simple. And Stalin even had this done. If I can get you to hate America,

1149
01:40:43,040 --> 01:40:46,680
because America's done bad things, and let's be honest, it has done bad things. Every country

1150
01:40:46,680 --> 01:40:51,940
in the world has. In fact, individual people have done bad things.

1151
01:40:51,940 --> 01:40:53,800
America has peed in the bed.

1152
01:40:53,800 --> 01:40:58,320
Yes, so all I have to do is get you to focus on those bad things. In fact, you can do this

1153
01:40:58,320 --> 01:41:04,240
on an individual level. And people do this when they reprogram people, when they capture

1154
01:41:04,240 --> 01:41:05,240
them in wars.

1155
01:41:05,240 --> 01:41:10,680
You see, I don't want you to like yourself. I want you to realize that you're a bad person,

1156
01:41:10,680 --> 01:41:11,960
but I can make you good by doing-

1157
01:41:11,960 --> 01:41:17,120
No, that's what all this is about. The Homeland Security, the TSA, the Hello Kitty guns being

1158
01:41:17,120 --> 01:41:18,120
evil.

1159
01:41:18,120 --> 01:41:22,180
It's we're bad, government's good, and you're right. The globalists say they wanna get rid

1160
01:41:22,180 --> 01:41:28,200
of all national identity. And even if the British monarchy is parasitic, it is still

1161
01:41:28,200 --> 01:41:35,460
a vestigial sign of old sovereignty and must be removed. And I absolutely agree with what

1162
01:41:35,460 --> 01:41:39,200
you're saying on that front. You are right.

1163
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:44,560
Because that's sort of the thing. The one thing though, I don't think it's a specific

1164
01:41:44,560 --> 01:41:50,320
conspiracy so much as these people actually believe they're helping the world evolve.

1165
01:41:50,320 --> 01:41:55,160
It's part of the 19th century progressivist idea. It came out of the 19th century-

1166
01:41:55,160 --> 01:42:00,240
Well, no, no, no. They always sell the progressivist idea to get well-meaning people to join them

1167
01:42:00,240 --> 01:42:06,480
and empower the inner conspiracy. But if you read the different programs, just intelligence

1168
01:42:06,480 --> 01:42:09,880
documents, I don't have to read Illuminati documents that have been made public over

1169
01:42:09,880 --> 01:42:16,120
the last 200 years, 200 plus years with people being killed by bolts of lightning or delivering

1170
01:42:16,120 --> 01:42:22,720
manuscripts and things like that in Germany. We know that always there's a good claim to

1171
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:24,740
get the good guys on your side.

1172
01:42:24,740 --> 01:42:29,780
You wanna keep your friends close, your enemies closer. And so the power structure surrounds

1173
01:42:29,780 --> 01:42:36,120
itself with a bunch of people that actually mean well and go out and work for the cover

1174
01:42:36,120 --> 01:42:42,040
story. But I'll assure you, the people running this wanna get rid of national sovereignty,

1175
01:42:42,040 --> 01:42:46,520
transfer that power to offshore mega systems that have their own global military.

1176
01:42:46,520 --> 01:42:52,420
And then they want that, all the nuclear weapons gathered up, so there won't be a big nuclear

1177
01:42:52,420 --> 01:42:57,680
war when they release the bio weapon that kills 99% of people. See, they tell their

1178
01:42:57,680 --> 01:43:01,480
minions, we're only gonna kill 80%. You and your family may be able to live. They've had

1179
01:43:01,480 --> 01:43:05,520
professors talk about this. I hope I work hard enough for the Earth and that I may be

1180
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:08,360
allowed to live when they release the airborne Ebola.

1181
01:43:08,360 --> 01:43:12,240
That's the UT professor talking about that and the FBI wouldn't visit him. But the point

1182
01:43:12,240 --> 01:43:18,000
is that, and then higher levels, 90% will be killed. And then higher level, it's no,

1183
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:23,340
5% will live. At the highest levels, they talk about killing everyone. And then the

1184
01:43:23,340 --> 01:43:27,000
last globalist will merge with the mega computer and become God.

1185
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:32,420
Now I'm not saying that's gonna actually happen. But do you think two New World Order Skeksis

1186
01:43:32,420 --> 01:43:38,840
up in their ivory tower, if they actually succeed in this program, merging with cybernetic

1187
01:43:38,840 --> 01:43:42,960
systems are not gonna kill each other? I mean, do you really think that?

1188
01:43:42,960 --> 01:43:49,280
Well, actually what I really think is that most of what you're seeing comes from H.G.

1189
01:43:49,280 --> 01:43:51,240
Wells and Bertrand Russell.

1190
01:43:51,240 --> 01:43:52,840
Yep, that's right. They all wrote about it.

1191
01:43:52,840 --> 01:43:56,320
I only heard of you three months ago, so I have no idea if you've even covered this or

1192
01:43:56,320 --> 01:44:01,640
not. But if you look at the history, when I say progressive, I don't mean the modern,

1193
01:44:01,640 --> 01:44:07,160
what came in America around the 20s, I think, 30s. I'm talking about the old 19th century

1194
01:44:07,160 --> 01:44:08,160
progressives.

1195
01:44:08,160 --> 01:44:11,760
You're getting out of your accent. Listen, I gotta jump. You're an interesting call,

1196
01:44:11,760 --> 01:44:14,960
but I promise to get to other people. That's why it's hard to go to calls. They're all

1197
01:44:14,960 --> 01:44:22,400
interesting. Oh, boy. We're in so much trouble. I mean, I go look at the general public. They

1198
01:44:22,400 --> 01:44:26,640
just go to their job. They just wanna go home and watch TV and drink beer. And I don't blame

1199
01:44:26,640 --> 01:44:31,800
you. But you are under attack. Your kids are under attack.

1200
01:44:31,800 --> 01:44:37,400
And I just can't believe that it doesn't wake everybody up that the media said there's no

1201
01:44:37,400 --> 01:44:42,660
world government, no black helicopters, no TSA checkpoints. I've got articles here I

1202
01:44:42,660 --> 01:44:47,280
haven't even gotten to yet. And again, I was aware of this. It's like I'm constantly reminded

1203
01:44:47,280 --> 01:44:51,360
by tyranny that I had just forgotten about.

1204
01:44:51,360 --> 01:44:56,760
And that's what's so frustrating, is that today I went up to infowars.com this morning

1205
01:44:56,760 --> 01:45:02,520
and saw Washington's blog linked up there. And he had boiled down Wall Street Journal.

1206
01:45:02,520 --> 01:45:06,320
Let me just actually get the article. Wall Street Journal with quotes. That's why I like

1207
01:45:06,320 --> 01:45:13,120
Washington's blog, cuz he adds a bunch of footnotes to it. He's got 15 mainstream and

1208
01:45:13,120 --> 01:45:27,320
government announcements. Wall Street Journal, Counterpunch, house.gov with the bill, and

1209
01:45:27,320 --> 01:45:29,320
the article's up at infowars.com.

1210
01:45:29,320 --> 01:45:39,240
Government to dispose of radioactive waste by putting it in your silverware. Now, 60-something

1211
01:45:39,240 --> 01:45:43,280
years ago, they had all this deadly fluoride sitting around. They were at the store. They

1212
01:45:43,280 --> 01:45:48,320
had big spills of it that killed entire rivers in Tennessee. It's well known. They're at

1213
01:45:48,320 --> 01:45:49,320
the nuclear plants.

1214
01:45:49,320 --> 01:45:53,920
So they just started, cuz it's used in the purification of uranium. They just started

1215
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:57,860
putting it in the water. It's all a big joke to the establishment. You go to any elitist

1216
01:45:57,860 --> 01:46:01,340
house or read any globalist publication, or they have articles about the Communist Chinese

1217
01:46:01,340 --> 01:46:07,160
Party only drinks purified water. They got caught with giant secret farms, where they

1218
01:46:07,160 --> 01:46:11,200
can grow stuff in greenhouses cuz of what's falling on the food.

1219
01:46:11,200 --> 01:46:17,680
I mean, they ship in dirt from other countries and grow it in greenhouses and have trucks

1220
01:46:17,680 --> 01:46:21,760
that follow the elite around and jet aircraft just like the Rockefellers, not to eat what

1221
01:46:21,760 --> 01:46:25,520
you're eating and not to drink it while they're telling you, it's good for you. Never mind

1222
01:46:25,520 --> 01:46:27,520
all the studies that's gonna do this to you.

1223
01:46:27,520 --> 01:46:32,840
Now they wanna take the uranium, which I remember learning like ten years ago, they put depleted

1224
01:46:32,840 --> 01:46:41,060
uranium in rebar now. They put it in quick-set concrete. I mean, we're just, folks, it's

1225
01:46:41,060 --> 01:46:46,740
so far gone right now. The Chinese executed government officials who got caught going

1226
01:46:46,740 --> 01:46:50,200
along with bribes to put melamine in powdered milk.

1227
01:46:50,200 --> 01:46:54,320
Here the FDA came out with four years ago during the scandal and said, you know what?

1228
01:46:54,320 --> 01:46:58,000
Melamine's not bad for you. When your kids die of kidney failure, they just put them

1229
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:03,200
on dialysis and they're not even gonna do a test to see what's in their kidneys. Now,

1230
01:47:03,200 --> 01:47:07,620
if you fed your kid melamine consciously, the cops would put you in jail for life.

1231
01:47:07,620 --> 01:47:15,280
But as long as it's from the store, it's okay. And why shouldn't they put radioactive waste

1232
01:47:15,280 --> 01:47:20,160
in the utensils you eat off of, which they admit gives you a lot of trace amounts of

1233
01:47:20,160 --> 01:47:24,120
it. And they got all this, they tried to pass this twice already in the last decade and

1234
01:47:24,120 --> 01:47:25,120
all that's linked to this.

1235
01:47:25,120 --> 01:47:32,120
I could spend all day on this one article, and I've got hundreds here. And what was the

1236
01:47:32,120 --> 01:47:38,520
other point I wanted to make about this? Yeah, just like it's been well known for 50 something

1237
01:47:38,520 --> 01:47:43,400
years that where they get this fluoride, the main fluoride they use isn't just from aluminum

1238
01:47:43,400 --> 01:47:45,800
or plutonium purification.

1239
01:47:45,800 --> 01:47:52,100
It's from, but you mind them, the uranium out of the limestone deposits that actually

1240
01:47:52,100 --> 01:47:56,760
has the phosphates. But the good phosphate goes to be on the cornfield or whatever, the

1241
01:47:56,760 --> 01:48:01,840
wheat field, the maize field, the canola field, whatever the case is. The bad phosphate they

1242
01:48:01,840 --> 01:48:03,440
can't sell goes in your water.

1243
01:48:03,440 --> 01:48:07,680
What else is in the phosphate? Where they mine it. That's why you also get the same

1244
01:48:07,680 --> 01:48:12,240
stuff they put in your water from a uranium purification facility that you get from a

1245
01:48:12,240 --> 01:48:18,640
phosphate fertilizer facility. Because it's the same, you mine uranium out of limestone.

1246
01:48:18,640 --> 01:48:21,540
That's where you get it in Colorado and Florida and other areas.

1247
01:48:21,540 --> 01:48:26,960
So here's the fun part about it. They just put it in the water. And it's an absolute

1248
01:48:26,960 --> 01:48:32,760
fact. I mean, I saw numbers, you can pull them up depending on which study, about kidney

1249
01:48:32,760 --> 01:48:42,960
and also bladder cancer from this. And hey, you know what? We're animals, we're scum,

1250
01:48:42,960 --> 01:48:46,160
so we're gonna be killed, globalist or boss.

1251
01:48:46,160 --> 01:48:50,160
And I'm a bad man for even telling you about it. I'm sorry I'm an extremist, you're right.

1252
01:48:50,160 --> 01:48:55,000
The national talk show host I heard yesterday, so-called liberal, talking about how I imagine

1253
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:59,240
black helicopters in a private solar reserve. You're right, you're right. They're not putting

1254
01:48:59,240 --> 01:49:02,520
uranium and plutonium and radon and all that.

1255
01:49:02,520 --> 01:49:06,600
You know what, you're right, you're right, you know what? You're right, everything's

1256
01:49:06,600 --> 01:49:11,600
fine. Just enjoy your camp. I mean, they're killing us, folks, and they're crazy. The

1257
01:49:11,600 --> 01:49:17,640
elite were crazy 50 years ago, but they didn't try to put uranium and plutonium in your stinking

1258
01:49:17,640 --> 01:49:23,920
spoons. I mean, and if they can get away with that, they can get away with expelling your

1259
01:49:23,920 --> 01:49:31,400
kids for talking about a Hello Kitty bubble projector. Why not?

1260
01:49:31,400 --> 01:49:33,920
Darryl and Tennessee are on the air, go ahead.

1261
01:49:33,920 --> 01:49:35,920
Good afternoon to you, Alex.

1262
01:49:35,920 --> 01:49:37,920
How you doing, buddy?

1263
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:45,200
I'm doing fine. First time caller, long time listener. I am tired of the United States

1264
01:49:45,200 --> 01:49:50,960
government infringing our Second Amendment. Because of that, I started a petition on the

1265
01:49:50,960 --> 01:49:55,480
White House website. And that's the saying we demand that any infringement of our Second

1266
01:49:55,480 --> 01:50:03,280
Amendment be an immediate impeachable offense with absolutely no exceptions.

1267
01:50:03,280 --> 01:50:08,080
I agree, Walter Jones, it's time to start the impeachment. Where is the impeachment?

1268
01:50:08,080 --> 01:50:12,560
It should be started now. The minute Dianne Feinstein introduced a bill saying Congress

1269
01:50:12,560 --> 01:50:16,920
can keep their guns, but we can't. That violates Article 1, Section 9, Clause 8, and a bunch

1270
01:50:16,920 --> 01:50:23,120
of others, unjust weights and measures. She should be immediately impeached. I mean, what

1271
01:50:23,120 --> 01:50:24,400
else won't we put up with?

1272
01:50:24,400 --> 01:50:28,520
I mean, it's almost like we put up with uranium in our water. I guess we do.

1273
01:50:28,520 --> 01:50:37,720
Exactly. Well, I have almost 3,000 signatures. I need another 97,000. So we have until February

1274
01:50:37,720 --> 01:50:40,040
22nd to try to get a-

1275
01:50:40,040 --> 01:50:44,080
Well, great job. Tell us the name of it.

1276
01:50:44,080 --> 01:50:49,120
We the people of the United States demand any infringement of our Second Amendment to

1277
01:50:49,120 --> 01:50:50,520
be an impeachable offense.

1278
01:50:50,520 --> 01:50:54,720
Yeah, great job. We'll get behind that. We've got our own petition coming out. It just got

1279
01:50:54,720 --> 01:50:59,120
filed. It's gonna be posted at infowars.com. Wait till you hear about this. We'll tell

1280
01:50:59,120 --> 01:51:01,120
you about it on the other side.

1281
01:51:01,120 --> 01:51:06,200
Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the bestselling book Cancer Step Outside the Box.

1282
01:51:06,200 --> 01:51:12,000
I want you to know some very important information. In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested

1283
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:16,280
that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could

1284
01:51:16,280 --> 01:51:21,760
obtain this world-class healer. Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around

1285
01:51:21,760 --> 01:51:26,200
the world to keep people healthy. Now, you can protect yourself and your loved ones in

1286
01:51:26,200 --> 01:51:32,040
this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal

1287
01:51:32,040 --> 01:51:36,920
cells only without harming a single normal cell. If you want to stay healthy, now's your

1288
01:51:36,920 --> 01:51:41,080

It's the only one you've got.

1292
01:52:05,200 --> 01:52:11,120
In the U.S., one in every 50 homes will have a break in this year. Burglars call it smash

1293
01:52:11,120 --> 01:52:18,680
and grab. Police call it robbery. We call it avoidable. We are Fake TV, a simple electronic

1294
01:52:18,680 --> 01:52:25,080
device that can fool even professional burglars. Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet and simulates

1295
01:52:25,080 --> 01:52:29,800
the changing colors of a television. To a burglar, it looks like someone must be home

1296
01:52:29,800 --> 01:52:36,280
watching TV, so they'll likely move on to an easier target. At only $34.95, Fake TV

1297
01:52:36,280 --> 01:52:40,920
costs less than a month of most alarm monitoring plants, and it's perfect if you're traveling

1298
01:52:40,920 --> 01:52:52,960
or away from home. Order your Fake TV by calling 877-5FAKETV or go to Faketv.com. That's 877-532-5388

1299
01:52:52,960 --> 01:53:00,680
or Faketv.com. Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.

1300
01:53:00,680 --> 01:53:04,960
We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water

1301
01:53:04,960 --> 01:53:09,440

All right, here's the deal. We always have a jam-packed third hour, but I have got to

1312
01:54:15,720 --> 01:54:21,320
start the third hour and take 20 phone calls in the first 30 minutes, or I am going to

1313
01:54:21,320 --> 01:54:29,040
tell Chris in there to put a shock collar on me and basically send me to Gitmo. I want

1314
01:54:29,040 --> 01:54:31,680
to take a bunch of your calls, rapid fire. We're going to do that. We've already taken

1315
01:54:31,680 --> 01:54:38,080
quite a few today. Then I'm going to get into the communist Chinese government again through

1316
01:54:38,080 --> 01:54:43,280
their People's Daily is saying take the American people's guns. A lot of other very, very important

1317
01:54:43,280 --> 01:54:49,720
news on that front. And we're going to get to some other special reports. Just a whole

1318
01:54:49,720 --> 01:54:53,960
host of issues on the economy. I need to talk about the economy and what's really happening

1319
01:54:53,960 --> 01:54:59,240
with the stock market on that front. But I wanted to bring Richard Reeves in here. Richard,

1320
01:54:59,240 --> 01:55:03,840
of course, you've seen co-host the show before, who's been a talk show host for about 10 years.

1321
01:55:03,840 --> 01:55:10,000
He works here in the office heading up InfowarsHealth.com and really testing and talking to the crew

1322
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:15,560
and other people about which of the 300, 400, whatever it is, the longevity products we

1323
01:55:15,560 --> 01:55:17,340
think are the very best.

1324
01:55:17,340 --> 01:55:20,880
The problem is there are so many that are really amazing. And I've been on a few of

1325
01:55:20,880 --> 01:55:25,560
the products. Aaron's been on about 10 of them and lost 97 pounds and just had a total

1326
01:55:25,560 --> 01:55:29,000
transformation. We're now launching a whole program today where Richard's going to make

1327
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:33,800
sure I take all my longevity and do all this. So we'll see what happens with that. I did

1328
01:55:33,800 --> 01:55:37,680
it about a year ago for about six months religiously and had amazing effects. Kind of ended up working

1329
01:55:37,680 --> 01:55:41,440
18 hours a day again and getting off some of it. We're going back on it. So Richard,

1330
01:55:41,440 --> 01:55:44,960
once a week will pop in with us with some of the new products, but also some of the

1331
01:55:44,960 --> 01:55:49,760
old products at InfowarsHealth.com. And Richard, in the few minutes we've got, tell us about

1332
01:55:49,760 --> 01:55:51,320
some of the products.

1333
01:55:51,320 --> 01:55:55,520
Well when talking about some of the old products, I remember back in January 2011 when you had

1334
01:55:55,520 --> 01:56:00,640
Doc Wallach on for the first time, talking about Young Jody. And that's when I basically

1335
01:56:00,640 --> 01:56:06,000
started every month without fail ordering a Healthy Start Pack or a version of the Healthy

1336
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:12,760
Start Pack. They've got the Healthy Start Pack with the digestive additional ingredients.

1337
01:56:12,760 --> 01:56:18,520
They've got the brain and heart. They've also got the Healthy Blood Sugar Pack. So bare

1338
01:56:18,520 --> 01:56:23,800
minimum, in my opinion, if you're interested in being prepared for what's coming up, if

1339
01:56:23,800 --> 01:56:31,040
our guns get taken away and really the stuff hits the fan, being healthy and prepared is

1340
01:56:31,040 --> 01:56:32,040
a big part of it.

1341
01:56:32,040 --> 01:56:35,780
The hospitals are killing people now. I mean, we have the worst health in the world. It's

1342
01:56:35,780 --> 01:56:40,160
time for all of us to get healthy. It doesn't mean any of us are perfect because everybody's

1343
01:56:40,160 --> 01:56:42,640
working hard, but we've got to all try.

1344
01:56:42,640 --> 01:56:47,160
That's it. Yeah, we're all working too many hours. We're all overstressed. So the Healthy

1345
01:56:47,160 --> 01:56:50,160
Start Pack, bare minimum. But one of the new products that everybody here at the office

1346
01:56:50,160 --> 01:56:53,360
really loves, and I know you like it too, is that Root Beer Belly.

1347
01:56:53,360 --> 01:56:56,360
I've taken a lot of probiotics. This one has a dramatic. I mean, it really works.

1348
01:56:56,360 --> 01:57:00,240
Well, that's great. And the microencapsulation is one of the biggest differences that the

1349
01:57:00,240 --> 01:57:06,560
Root Beer Belly has. The probiotics, the good bacteria for your gut is microencapsulated

1350
01:57:06,560 --> 01:57:10,320
in this product. And that way, it has a better opportunity to make it through your digestive.

1351
01:57:10,320 --> 01:57:11,720
It makes it through the stomach acid.

1352
01:57:11,720 --> 01:57:15,600
Through the stomach acid, exactly, to get down in your intestines where it can do the

1353
01:57:15,600 --> 01:57:20,320
work that it needs to do. So this is a really good product. The kids like it. It's tasty.

1354
01:57:20,320 --> 01:57:23,760
You just sprinkle it on your tongue and then swallow it. It does taste like Root Beer.

1355
01:57:23,760 --> 01:57:27,360
And that's why it's called Root Beer Belly. And it's really great. Here's one of the brochures

1356
01:57:27,360 --> 01:57:33,840
for it. But the people here at the office, just unanimously, I had a little box like

1357
01:57:33,840 --> 01:57:35,360
this open there in my office.

1358
01:57:35,360 --> 01:57:36,920
Everybody's always raiding my supplies.

1359
01:57:36,920 --> 01:57:38,600
I invited them. Well, I

1360
01:57:38,600 --> 01:57:39,600
I'm just teasing.

1361
01:57:39,600 --> 01:57:42,200
Well, for that purpose, I actually ordered some extra.

1362
01:57:42,200 --> 01:57:45,520
And there's also the Polymer's Plus that I've endorsed.

1363
01:57:45,520 --> 01:57:49,520
Right. The Polymer's Plus is the best sports drink, energy drink out there. Totally healthy

1364
01:57:49,520 --> 01:57:53,840
with all the B vitamins, the rest of it. The essential fatty acids complex that Wallach's

1365
01:57:53,840 --> 01:57:59,400
put out and so many other products at Infowarshealth.com. Tell folks about that little baby right there.

1366
01:57:59,400 --> 01:58:03,520
That's what's getting the rave reviews from the tens of thousands of people that shop

1367
01:58:03,520 --> 01:58:05,020
at Infowarshealth.com.

1368
01:58:05,020 --> 01:58:12,440
That's right, folks. This is called ASAP. It's an acronym for As Slim As Possible. And folks

1369
01:58:12,440 --> 01:58:16,040
are really having great success on that. I'm hoping to finally get Alex on this product.

1370
01:58:16,040 --> 01:58:19,240
I've been mentioning it to him for two, three months here, but I think finally we're going

1371
01:58:19,240 --> 01:58:25,240
to be able to get Alex going on it. And it helps you. It has protein fractions and amino

1372
01:58:25,240 --> 01:58:32,000
acids that help support the release of adipose fat. And it really helps you lose weight.

1373
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:33,000
We've had some people.

1374
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:36,600
People can find out more or call and get their questions answered. The phone numbers are

1375
01:58:36,600 --> 01:58:39,200
on the site. Infowarshealth.com. We'll be back.

1377
01:58:52,120 --> 01:58:56,800
Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our

1378
01:58:56,800 --> 01:59:02,440
immunity and health. At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing

1379
01:59:02,440 --> 01:59:07,880
a full selection of silver-based products. Our most popular silver-based products are

1380
01:59:07,880 --> 01:59:13,800
the 32-ounce nano-silver solutions, our 2-ounce nano-silver nasal applicators, as well as

1381
01:59:13,800 --> 01:59:21,300
our all-natural silver soaps. Just released is our 100% natural silver gel. Our new silver

1382
01:59:21,300 --> 01:59:26,120
gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and leave the silver

1383
01:59:26,120 --> 01:59:31,640
at the surface. But rather, we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin-nourishing

1384
01:59:31,640 --> 01:59:36,720
chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the

1385
01:59:36,720 --> 01:59:45,120
silver more effectively. Visit www.silverlungs.com and click on our store page to find what silver-based

products are best for you. That's www.silverlungs.com.

Aging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. Big brother, mainstream

1388
02:00:07,720 --> 02:00:16,000
media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the

1389
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:24,400
GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.

1390
02:00:24,400 --> 02:00:31,160
All right, I'm going to your calls in the next segment. That's eight minutes away. We're

1391
02:00:31,160 --> 02:00:35,360
going to go to James, John, Brian, Joseph, John and others. I appreciate you holding.

1392
02:00:35,360 --> 02:00:40,160
We're going to go fast to your calls, I promise, and then a blitz of news. But I wanted to

1393
02:00:40,160 --> 02:00:44,640
get Richard in here for like three minutes once a week just to plug some of the different

1394
02:00:44,640 --> 02:00:49,040
products we never talk about at Infowarshealth.com, because these are the best products we put

1395
02:00:49,040 --> 02:00:53,080
in one place. You can get discounts there when you sign up to be a distributor. It's

1396
02:00:53,080 --> 02:00:58,680
a great business opportunity as well, Infowarsteam.com. But at the same time, I mean, this is the

1397
02:00:58,680 --> 02:01:02,720
big group. This is the, it's why I never really endorse vitamins and minerals until I found

1398
02:01:02,720 --> 02:01:06,720
these folks, because they know what they're talking about.

1399
02:01:06,720 --> 02:01:10,400
And now they went and got a big Clemson University study that they've been talking about doing,

1400
02:01:10,400 --> 02:01:15,480
they've been, you know, researching the last year. Tell people what they found just on

1401
02:01:15,480 --> 02:01:19,740
the colon cancer certified by a major university. This is Breakthrough.

1402
02:01:19,740 --> 02:01:24,120
This is Breakthrough. I tell you, folks, I cannot stress how really important this is.

1403
02:01:24,120 --> 02:01:29,320
But here is from a press release, this release a couple days ago, this Beyond Tang Tendering

1404
02:01:29,320 --> 02:01:33,900
and Ultimate Classic were administered to healthy human colon cells. There was no significant

1405
02:01:33,900 --> 02:01:40,320
death of healthy human cells compared to cancerous colon cells. Ultimate Classic killed 95% of

1406
02:01:40,320 --> 02:01:46,680
cancerous colon cells, 65% of cancerous liver cells, 65% of cancerous stomach cells, and

1407
02:01:46,680 --> 02:01:49,140
30% of cancerous breast cells.

1408
02:01:49,140 --> 02:01:54,480
And Beyond Tang Tendering killed 60% of cancerous colon cells, 65% of cancerous liver and stomach

1409
02:01:54,480 --> 02:01:57,560
cells, and 30% of cancerous breast cells.

1410
02:01:57,560 --> 02:02:01,600
And by the way, I know we were gonna post this tomorrow, but go ahead and have a don.

1411
02:02:01,600 --> 02:02:06,160
Post the Ben Fuchs interview on how to get off Prozac-type drugs. But go ahead and post

1412
02:02:06,160 --> 02:02:11,120
that press release with links right after this cuz I wanna send people there. This is

1413
02:02:11,120 --> 02:02:16,160
a major scientific study in the laboratory on record. And again, this has already been

1414
02:02:16,160 --> 02:02:17,480
backed up by other studies.

1415
02:02:17,480 --> 02:02:23,160
They know what mega dosage is of vitamin C and B vitamins and things due to cancer. Linus

1416
02:02:23,160 --> 02:02:27,040
Pauling won the Nobel Prize for it. They do not want people knowing this.

1417
02:02:27,040 --> 02:02:32,620
No, they don't, you're right. And I don't think I ever recall seeing any kind of a study

1418
02:02:32,620 --> 02:02:38,120
result like this where they're talking about vitamin, minerals, supplements actually killing

1419
02:02:38,120 --> 02:02:39,720
cancer cells. I don't recall ever seeing-

1420
02:02:39,720 --> 02:02:44,600
Here, let me see the Yahoo News press release. Can I see the whole page in the front? I wanna

1421
02:02:44,600 --> 02:02:49,120
show people the headlines so they can find it wherever they want. Here it is out of Yahoo

1422
02:02:49,120 --> 02:02:56,160
Finance, ladies and gentlemen. Okay, AL International, that's the longevity parent company, announces

1423
02:02:56,160 --> 02:03:01,080
results of the longevity clinical research study performance by Clemson University Institute

1424
02:03:01,080 --> 02:03:07,280
of Nutritional Research. I mean, this is groundbreaking. And we'll post this right now at infowars.com

1425
02:03:07,280 --> 02:03:12,320
and prisonplanet.com. And ask them once it's posted with the video, send it out at real

1426
02:03:12,320 --> 02:03:15,600
Alex Jones on Twitter, Richard. I mean, that's a big deal.

1427
02:03:15,600 --> 02:03:20,080
It is a big deal, I agree. It's a huge deal and so I can't encourage people enough.

1428
02:03:20,080 --> 02:03:23,720
Well, it's what Ben Fuchs said. I lost 40 pounds, and even though it's unadvertised

1429
02:03:23,720 --> 02:03:27,680
as weight loss, when I followed most of it for a couple months. Then I got off of it

1430
02:03:27,680 --> 02:03:31,720
cuz I'm just not in the habit, my kid's wife are doing it. I do it some. And then I talk

1431
02:03:31,720 --> 02:03:36,160
to Fuchs and that's what others say. It's the gut flora, I've gotta totally change that

1432
02:03:36,160 --> 02:03:41,560
like Aaron did, or I won't get the full results. So now we're going to go on the full program

1433
02:03:41,560 --> 02:03:42,560
here.

1434
02:03:42,560 --> 02:03:45,960
Well, anybody's out there that's getting the healthy start pack and not getting results,

1435
02:03:45,960 --> 02:03:49,880
the digestive tract issues, you gotta look at it. That's what we've got, Root Beer Belly

1436
02:03:49,880 --> 02:03:54,960
is one of the great probiotics that Young Jevity carries. And infowarshealth.com carries,

1437
02:03:54,960 --> 02:04:06,160
go to infowarshealth.com and infowarsteam.com to sign up. You can call in and order at 888-789-9277.

1438
02:04:06,160 --> 02:04:14,040
That's the Infowars Health product order line 888-789-9277. At bare minimum, folks, you're

1439
02:04:14,040 --> 02:04:19,240
already spending money on food and supplements and things like that at your chain supermarkets

1440
02:04:19,240 --> 02:04:21,200
and chain drugstores and all that.

1441
02:04:21,200 --> 02:04:25,000
You've got to, at bare minimum, be on one of the healthy start packs.

1442
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:29,040
Yeah, this stuff totally blows anything we've seen away. That's why we went out and picked

1443
02:04:29,040 --> 02:04:32,520

1471
02:07:01,600 --> 02:07:06,440
Coming back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive? From natural disasters

1472
02:07:06,440 --> 02:07:11,000
like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on

1473
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:16,120
by a disastrous economy. Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything. At eFoods

1474
02:07:16,120 --> 02:07:20,200
Direct, we hear from customers every day that are fortunate enough to weather a life storm

1475
02:07:20,200 --> 02:07:24,720
by having a supply of food on hand. After Hurricane Sandy, Danny from New York City

1476
02:07:24,720 --> 02:07:30,400
wrote, almost all the grocery stores are closed but I managed to get my eFoods just in time

1477
02:07:30,400 --> 02:07:35,160
to be able to help my sister and niece. It is better to be prepared 10 years too early

1478
02:07:35,160 --> 02:07:39,760
than one day too late. I can warn you but I can't feed you. Heed the warnings and do

1482
02:08:22,720 --> 02:08:29,720
We are turning our atmosphere into their atmosphere. We are like a natural resource to them. To

1483
02:08:29,720 --> 02:08:36,720
keep the planet, move on to another. They want benign indifference. They want us drugging.

1484
02:08:36,720 --> 02:08:45,720
We could be pets. We could be food. But all we really are is lifestyle. Our impulses are

1485
02:08:45,720 --> 02:08:51,720
being redirected. We are living in an artificially induced state of consciousness that resembles

1486
02:08:51,720 --> 02:09:01,720
sleep. We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the

1487
02:09:01,720 --> 02:09:08,720
resistance. Alex Jones here back live going straight to your phone calls and then I'm

1488
02:09:08,720 --> 02:09:13,720
going to give you some really good news. I'm sure you heard yesterday Gatorade is responding

1489
02:09:13,720 --> 02:09:23,720
to a young girl's petition. She got 200,000 signatures to get Gatorade to remove a chemical

1490
02:09:23,720 --> 02:09:30,720
BVO directly connected to behavioral problems, cancer, you name it. And folks, they don't

1491
02:09:30,720 --> 02:09:36,720
put this stuff in there by accident. I want to explain to you that Bertrand Russell, all

1492
02:09:36,720 --> 02:09:41,720
of them, literally hundreds of these guys, all wrote in the 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s,

1493
02:09:41,720 --> 02:09:47,720
like the current White House science czar did, about manipulating things to then create

1494
02:09:47,720 --> 02:09:49,720
behavioral control.

1495
02:09:49,720 --> 02:09:55,720
It makes you very, very submissive. So we're going to be going over that. But it's an example

1496
02:09:55,720 --> 02:10:00,720
of solution, people fighting back. All that and more is coming up. And I haven't gotten

1497
02:10:00,720 --> 02:10:06,720
to the Icelandic president at Davos, how he saved his country. It's an amazing short club.

1498
02:10:06,720 --> 02:10:10,720
But right now, let's go quickly to your calls. James in Pennsylvania, thank you for holding.

1499
02:10:10,720 --> 02:10:11,720
Sir, you're on the air.

1500
02:10:11,720 --> 02:10:13,720
Hey, how are you doing?

1501
02:10:13,720 --> 02:10:14,720
Good.

1502
02:10:14,720 --> 02:10:20,720
The man speaking out in the darkness in the wilderness. Hey, I just like this Constitution.

1503
02:10:20,720 --> 02:10:25,720
Like, you know, a lot of people just isn't educated on the Constitution. And I've been

1504
02:10:25,720 --> 02:10:31,720
going around just making copies of the Constitution. You know, as far as the Second Amendment goes,

1505
02:10:31,720 --> 02:10:36,720
they don't really understand. And a lot of them just haven't been educated on it. Far

1506
02:10:36,720 --> 02:10:40,720
as I could see, you know, I talked to some friends and stuff. They don't even know what

1507
02:10:40,720 --> 02:10:45,720
all the gun laws is all about and stuff. They just think, you know, to bear arms and to

1508
02:10:45,720 --> 02:10:46,720
protect your home.

1509
02:10:46,720 --> 02:10:53,720
Well, I mean, here's the problem. And then you can elaborate. The people running the

1510
02:10:53,720 --> 02:10:59,720
system and controlling our tax money, Eisenhower said this in his farewell address in 61. Back

1511
02:10:59,720 --> 02:11:06,720
then, it was close to 90 percent. Now it's over 90 percent. Eighty seven percent in 61.

1512
02:11:06,720 --> 02:11:10,720
Now it's like 93. Last time I checked of all research, public and private is taxpayer funded

1513
02:11:10,720 --> 02:11:11,720
and controlled by DARPA.

1514
02:11:11,720 --> 02:11:16,720
And there are a bunch of eugenicists at the top of it. A lot of good scientists work there,

1515
02:11:16,720 --> 02:11:22,720
but they are able to shape the world and play God. And that's the problem is that these

1516
02:11:22,720 --> 02:11:28,720
globalist are bad people. So something can have a good cover story of why it's happening.

1517
02:11:28,720 --> 02:11:34,720
But it always fits into something larger that's being set up, not for our own good.

1518
02:11:34,720 --> 02:11:38,720
And these autonomous drones and robots and the surveillance, we should not be letting

1519
02:11:38,720 --> 02:11:43,720
our money go to this. Our tax money is building our own prison. Sorry, go ahead.

1520
02:11:43,720 --> 02:11:48,720
Well, I totally agree with everything you say. Like I said, I've been listening to you

1521
02:11:48,720 --> 02:11:50,720
for at least about 12 years. God bless you.

1522
02:11:50,720 --> 02:11:55,720
And I mean, I can't really stop. I can't turn my phone off. Only reason I pay a phone bill

1523
02:11:55,720 --> 02:12:02,720
is just to listen to you. But like I say, it's like people just isn't educated. You

1524
02:12:02,720 --> 02:12:07,720
know, I mean, they messed the education system up. They don't teach the Constitution in schools.

1525
02:12:07,720 --> 02:12:11,720
And I'm thinking like the way they have these little Bibles in the hotels and stuff, why

1526
02:12:11,720 --> 02:12:16,720
don't they put the Constitution in the motels and hotels at the bedside?

1527
02:12:16,720 --> 02:12:22,720
I agree with you, but here's the problem. They've dumbed most people down so far, they

1528
02:12:22,720 --> 02:12:26,720
don't even understand the Constitution. There are major studies out. Let's just randomly

1529
02:12:26,720 --> 02:12:32,720
show people one. Type in the average vocabulary is shrinking, not just here, but worldwide.

1530
02:12:32,720 --> 02:12:39,720
Ours is shrinking the fastest. Young people, they admit computers rewire their brains where

1531
02:12:39,720 --> 02:12:44,720
they can't even communicate with humans and have all these fractured thought processes.

1532
02:12:44,720 --> 02:12:50,720
And again, this has been scientifically deployed. I mean, they're telling people they just created

1533
02:12:50,720 --> 02:12:56,720
autonomous drones last year that make their own decisions. They had pre-programmed drones

1534
02:12:56,720 --> 02:13:03,720
like Voyager and Viking and others that went to foreign planets, pre-programmed.

1535
02:13:03,720 --> 02:13:08,720
And they had autonomous stuff that was working very well 15 years ago, where you could say

1536
02:13:08,720 --> 02:13:13,720
it was truly autonomous. I mean, what do you think that means for the ruling elite that

1537
02:13:13,720 --> 02:13:17,720
they're gonna have all these robot armies we pay for that don't even have a human to

1538
02:13:17,720 --> 02:13:22,720
say no? It's not even humans even picking the targets or pulling the trigger now. How

1539
02:13:22,720 --> 02:13:26,720
bad is it gonna be in 10 years? And again, the people running the show are not people

1540
02:13:26,720 --> 02:13:28,720
that are good. I'm sorry, go ahead.

1541
02:13:28,720 --> 02:13:33,720
Oh, I mean, I totally agree with you on that too. Like I'm saying this stuff, it's like

1542
02:13:33,720 --> 02:13:39,720
a big cloud over the whole world, the whole earth. And people are just totally walking

1543
02:13:39,720 --> 02:13:44,720
in darkness. I mean, I don't even know how I even see what's going on. It's like, wow,

1544
02:13:44,720 --> 02:13:49,720
you know, every time I'm listening to you, I could see that. I mean, it just opened my

1545
02:13:49,720 --> 02:13:53,720
mind up, the whole world is like, I mean, it's just an evil world.

1546
02:13:53,720 --> 02:13:57,720
It is, sir, but there's good people in it like you, God bless you. Let me just say this.

1547
02:13:57,720 --> 02:14:04,720
The young lady in the United States, in Mississippi, discovered that they had this manipulated,

1548
02:14:04,720 --> 02:14:08,720
romanated vegetable oil. You can take vegetable oil, make anything you want. And it's very

1549
02:14:08,720 --> 02:14:10,720
bad, according to just countless studies.

1550
02:14:10,720 --> 02:14:15,720
She exposed it and because of the public picking up on it because of the Internet, they're

1551
02:14:15,720 --> 02:14:22,720
now gonna remove it out of all of the Gatorade, okay? Now, why do they wanna put toxins in

1552
02:14:22,720 --> 02:14:27,720
drinks and foods? Most toxins become addictive, your body gets used to operating with them.

1553
02:14:27,720 --> 02:14:32,720
So they put toxins in the food to make it addictive, like aspartame and the rest of

1554
02:14:32,720 --> 02:14:35,720
it. Now, that's a solution right there.

1555
02:14:35,720 --> 02:14:42,720
Well, I'm gonna talk about it after we go to the calls. It's just that I exposed, not

1556
02:14:42,720 --> 02:14:46,720
because I'm a hero, I don't like this happening to anybody. I have empathy. If it happens

1557
02:14:46,720 --> 02:14:53,720
to you, it can happen to me, that they put radioactive isotopes in the so-called fluoride,

1558
02:14:53,720 --> 02:14:58,720
the hydrofluorosolic acid that you drink, out of the uranium mines that are also the

1559
02:14:58,720 --> 02:15:01,720
fertilizer mines, same mines, same mines.

1560
02:15:01,720 --> 02:15:06,720
They just purify it out, and they put the poison in our water as a big joke and make

1561
02:15:06,720 --> 02:15:12,720
us pay for it. Austin's like $1,200,000 a year to pay for stuff that's a toxic waste.

1562
02:15:12,720 --> 02:15:18,720
Now, there's a Wall Street Journal article out, and we've got it up at infowars.com,

1563
02:15:18,720 --> 02:15:25,720
where I talked about this last hour, that they're putting different radioactive isotopes

1564
02:15:25,720 --> 02:15:34,720
like uranium and different isotopes of uranium in, they're already putting them in forklifts

1565
02:15:34,720 --> 02:15:39,720
and quickcrete and all this other stuff, the fast-setting concrete.

1566
02:15:39,720 --> 02:15:43,720
Now, they're gonna put it in your furniture and your knives and spoons, and so they're

1567
02:15:43,720 --> 02:15:48,720
calling for knives and spoons to go all the way. If we can get people to eat off this,

1568
02:15:48,720 --> 02:15:55,720
they'll do anything. See, it's all about if we can ban Hello Kitty bubble projectors,

1569
02:15:55,720 --> 02:15:57,720
we can ban anything.

1570
02:15:57,720 --> 02:16:02,720
See, it's all about how much can they grab, how crazy can it get? Imagine 20 years ago

1571
02:16:02,720 --> 02:16:06,720
saying, you'll go to the airport and they'll stick their hands down your pants and put

1572
02:16:06,720 --> 02:16:10,720
you on a body scanner, and you'll put your hands up. It's all about you're a criminal.

1573
02:16:10,720 --> 02:16:20,720
And it's just amazing that we put up with this. Let's talk to Jonathan or John in Louisiana.

1574
02:16:20,720 --> 02:16:22,720
You're on the air, sir, go ahead.

1575
02:16:22,720 --> 02:16:30,720
Hi, Alex. I was listening about a year, the last year sometime, you mentioned your uncle

1576
02:16:30,720 --> 02:16:34,720
got, took a tetanus shot and almost killed him.

1577
02:16:34,720 --> 02:16:35,720
Yep.

1578
02:16:35,720 --> 02:16:41,720
It was a similar experience. My doctor, who's a friend of my brother, who's also a doctor,

1579
02:16:41,720 --> 02:16:45,720
wanted, he wanted to give me a flu shot and I said, no, I'm not doing that for obvious

1580
02:16:45,720 --> 02:16:51,720
reasons. And so he wanted me to take a tetanus shot instead. So I didn't see any harm in

1581
02:16:51,720 --> 02:16:57,720
it, so I took the tetanus shot. And it felt like that evening, like I got hit by a freight

1582
02:16:57,720 --> 02:17:02,720
train on the side where I got the shot, and I developed a fever that lasted about 12 hours.

1583
02:17:02,720 --> 02:17:07,720
Two weeks later, I'm back at the doctor's office with a cardiac problem.

1584
02:17:07,720 --> 02:17:14,720
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. It causes an autoimmune response. I'm not a doctor, I had brain surgeons

1585
02:17:14,720 --> 02:17:22,720
on. It causes brain swelling, that's the headache, and then later it causes swelling in the different

1586
02:17:22,720 --> 02:17:27,720
valves of the heart. I mean, that's CDC. And that doctor will tell you there are no side

1587
02:17:27,720 --> 02:17:33,720
effects. You know why they had to stop the smallpox vaccinations in 2002 for the military?

1588
02:17:33,720 --> 02:17:39,720
Cuz so many died. Remember the NBC reporter took the shot and died an hour later? Had

1589
02:17:39,720 --> 02:17:45,720
no heart, your heart, it's not just your throat that'll swell shut with an autoimmune response.

1590
02:17:45,720 --> 02:17:50,720
It's your heart does, and I'm sorry, yeah, yeah, same thing happened to my uncle. He

1591
02:17:50,720 --> 02:17:55,720
couldn't breathe, had to go to the hospital, swole up, had heart palpitations, brain swelling.

1592
02:17:55,720 --> 02:17:58,720
And of course, this was 20 something years ago, and they said it was his tetanus shot,

1593
02:17:58,720 --> 02:17:59,720
but sorry, go ahead.

1594
02:17:59,720 --> 02:18:04,720
Well, the thing was is I didn't know it, but in a tetanus shot, they throw in a whooping

1595
02:18:04,720 --> 02:18:06,720
cough vaccine. I didn't know that.

1596
02:18:06,720 --> 02:18:10,720
Oh, they gave you a combo, or yeah, yeah, no, medical stuff's all about deceiving you

1597
02:18:10,720 --> 02:18:15,720
now. Yeah, no, they have a lot of triple jabs. So how did it end? Does your heart get okay

1598
02:18:15,720 --> 02:18:16,720
after they tried to kill you?

1599
02:18:16,720 --> 02:18:23,720
Well, I've been taking Dr. Wallach, well, because of you and Dr. Wallach, I'm taking

1600
02:18:23,720 --> 02:18:30,720
the Alex Pack, and when the Alex Pack says, I order it in bulk, they sent me these stiffs

1601
02:18:30,720 --> 02:18:36,720
from Dr. Wallach on Hell's Kitchen, just like a radio show that he did or something.

1602
02:18:36,720 --> 02:18:37,720
Yes, mm-hmm.

1603
02:18:37,720 --> 02:18:42,720
And they talk about, I had type 2 diabetes, and he says, well, you can cure that with

1604
02:18:42,720 --> 02:18:47,720
the deficiency of chromium and vanadium. He's got a product for that, I take that too.

1605
02:18:47,720 --> 02:18:53,720
And here's the $64 million question, did the Infowars Health products help you?

1606
02:18:53,720 --> 02:18:58,720
Absolutely, as a matter of fact, I'm getting ready to kiss off my cardiologist and get

1607
02:18:58,720 --> 02:19:00,720
out of the medical program altogether.

1608
02:19:00,720 --> 02:19:05,720
By the way, they found the article about the NBC reporter who died of the smallpox shot,

1609
02:19:05,720 --> 02:19:09,720
the World Net Daily, the guys actually just put that on screen. No, no, I mean, it's incredible.

1610
02:19:09,720 --> 02:19:14,720
Listen, they've tried three separate times to make the military take the experimental

1611
02:19:14,720 --> 02:19:20,720
anthrax shot, but it always kills so many people, their own doctors refuse. Listen,

1612
02:19:20,720 --> 02:19:26,720
they did an H1N1 variant shot a year before in Europe, five years ago, and it killed,

1613
02:19:26,720 --> 02:19:31,720
at one homeless shelter, 23 of the 30 people that were given it, okay?

1614
02:19:31,720 --> 02:19:36,720
And then again, the whole hoax is, we're wearing white lab coats, there is no adverse reaction,

1615
02:19:36,720 --> 02:19:41,720
don't be a conspiracy theorist. So what did your doctor say after you had all these problems

1616
02:19:41,720 --> 02:19:44,720
from the tetanus shot? Did he tell you you were a conspiracy theorist?

1617
02:19:44,720 --> 02:19:50,720
Well, no, he was kind of shocked, but I don't think he really knew he was going to do me any harm.

1618
02:19:50,720 --> 02:19:53,720
Oh yeah, they always act like that, they know full well what they're doing.

1619
02:19:53,720 --> 02:19:57,720
They get kickbacks, okay? They get kickbacks to push vaccines.

1620
02:19:57,720 --> 02:20:00,720
My dad's a dentist and he's had offers and said no.

1621
02:20:00,720 --> 02:20:05,720
Hi there, my name is Frank Bates. What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could

1622
02:20:05,720 --> 02:20:10,720
get me in a lot of trouble. I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com.

1623
02:20:10,720 --> 02:20:15,720
That exposes the electricity monopolies and government agencies for what they really are.

1624
02:20:15,720 --> 02:20:22,720
Incompetent line crooks that are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high.

1625
02:20:22,720 --> 02:20:27,720
Some have called this a conspiracy, others have called it a cover up, and you will be shocked

1626
02:20:27,720 --> 02:20:34,720
to find out how deep the conspiracy goes. My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth

1627
02:20:34,720 --> 02:20:38,720
and shows you the secret of how I beat them and how you can beat them too.

1628
02:20:38,720 --> 02:20:44,720
Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen in the last three months.

1631
02:20:56,720 --> 02:20:59,720
Again, that's 123coverup.com.

1632
02:20:59,720 --> 02:21:12,720
You land in Buenos Aires, then a shuttle to Santa Rosa, where a nicely furnished cabin with all amenities, Wi-Fi, executive food and wine, and laundry service awaits.

1633
02:21:12,720 --> 02:21:20,720

We the people grow cotton, we fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it lead back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.

1642
02:22:38,720 --> 02:22:45,720
This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?

1643
02:22:45,720 --> 02:22:53,720

And we are back. I'm going to get into the economy and get into immigration reform as they're calling it.

1655
02:24:11,720 --> 02:24:18,720
Totally open borders. Hey, how about Mexico? Let US citizens come there unlimited and give us free welfare and have our kids for free.

1656
02:24:18,720 --> 02:24:26,720
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. It's only the US that needs to do that because we need to be bankrupted. The global is starting to completely run Mexico.

1657
02:24:26,720 --> 02:24:30,720
Brian in Ohio, you're on the air. Welcome.

1658
02:24:30,720 --> 02:24:31,720
Hi, Alex. How are you doing?

1659
02:24:31,720 --> 02:24:33,720
Good, brother.

1660
02:24:33,720 --> 02:24:44,720
Hey, I got a couple of questions for you, Alex. The first question is what percent of the US military do you think would actually turn a fire on the people that most of them turned up to protect?

1661
02:24:44,720 --> 02:24:50,720
I would say about 80%. They've actually done studies, 29 Palms, but many other more modern ones.

1662
02:24:50,720 --> 02:24:59,720
When they're sitting around doing a survey and not ordered to fire on US citizens if they're asked if they will, 75, 80, 85% say no.

1663
02:24:59,720 --> 02:25:07,720
But in peer pressure, after the evil right wing group has blown up some schools and killed military and there's a propaganda piece,

1664
02:25:07,720 --> 02:25:19,720
I would say about 70% will fire on citizens, at least in the first waves, and then it'll all be advertised like it was a great thing they did.

1665
02:25:19,720 --> 02:25:28,720
But then people will remember the history of what's happened and folks will start analyzing what went on.

1666
02:25:28,720 --> 02:25:38,720
And if it actually gets to that point, it'll be a civil war. And the general public that's awake to the New World Order, they're not going to be going after police and military unless they get in their way.

1667
02:25:38,720 --> 02:25:50,720
They're going to be going after globalists. And so I hope it doesn't go there, but the police will probably follow orders, a lot of the military will, to try to protect the globalists and it won't matter at that point.

1668
02:25:50,720 --> 02:25:59,720
And I hope it doesn't go there, but the real globalists are going to set off shore while their minions carry this out.

1669
02:25:59,720 --> 02:26:07,720
But their entire force structure, the training, the preparation, like in the Cold War, the government trained to fight the Russians.

1670
02:26:07,720 --> 02:26:17,720
And we were told on the surface the last 12 years we were training to fight Al Qaeda, turns out the globalists run Al Qaeda, and behind the scenes they were trying to take on We the People.

1671
02:26:17,720 --> 02:26:26,720
This is a foreign banking cartel takeover and it's a fact. They train 24-7 to take our guns and put us in reeducation camps.

1672
02:26:26,720 --> 02:26:31,720
And there are millions of people who aren't going to go to a reeducation camp. And so there's going to be a war.

1673
02:26:31,720 --> 02:26:39,720
And they don't want to have a war where they started and don't have the moral authority. They'll go out and blow stuff up and blame it on us to say we started it.

1674
02:26:39,720 --> 02:26:48,720
And so just be aware of that psy-op. And I'm sorry it's come down to this, but they're lining up their people everywhere to launch something very, very soon, I'm afraid.

1675
02:26:48,720 --> 02:26:58,720
Okay, Alex, my second question is about the whole banking system. I mean, do you personally have money in a bank account?

1676
02:26:58,720 --> 02:27:09,720
Absolutely. I have quite a few bank accounts for the operation because I operate within the system. Individuals can get out of the system.

1677
02:27:09,720 --> 02:27:21,720
And I think that's a good way to go for a lot of people. It's your decision to make. I am totally in the system because I'm operating an operation with 50 crew members roughly and infrastructure.

1678
02:27:21,720 --> 02:27:31,720
I've decided to be fully exposed to the system so that I can actively engage it, kind of like jacking into the matrix.

1679
02:27:31,720 --> 02:27:42,720
But I personally don't have that many assets. The assets I do have are mainly in land and a little bit of backup cash and gold and silver.

1680
02:27:42,720 --> 02:27:48,720
Okay, sir. Well, God bless you, Alex, and thanks for accepting my call.

1681
02:27:48,720 --> 02:27:57,720
Absolutely. But callers always say thank you for accepting my call. Thanks for getting me on because they screen people so heavily.

1682
02:27:57,720 --> 02:28:05,720
Now, we don't screen calls. We get some goofy ones, but we also get some great ones. If you volunteer where you're listening from and what you want to bring up, that's a good thing.

1683
02:28:05,720 --> 02:28:13,720
Or I screen calls by saying I'm going to have people call in on this subject, and then obviously people need to call in on that subject.

1684
02:28:13,720 --> 02:28:21,720
You don't need to thank me for letting you on the air. Look, don't thank me for fighting the New World Order, folks. I'm just not insane.

1685
02:28:21,720 --> 02:28:31,720
I mean, they're putting radioactive isotopes in your drinking water. Our cancer rates are exploding. They're killing us, and they write books like Eco Science bragging how they're doing it.

1686
02:28:31,720 --> 02:28:41,720
I'm fundamentally upset about that. I'm risking my life here, not because I'm a hero, folks. There's no future if we don't get out of this.

1687
02:28:41,720 --> 02:28:49,720
You've heard my analogy a thousand times. Let's go to John in Arkansas. You're on the air. Go ahead.

1688
02:28:49,720 --> 02:28:51,720
Hello. Hey, John.

1689
02:28:51,720 --> 02:29:02,720
Hey, Alex. Just a couple of pieces of information there for you. Good job with Piers Morgan there, and I didn't know about you until you went on that show, so that was a great benefit to me.

1690
02:29:02,720 --> 02:29:08,720
Oh, yeah. It's not that his show was big. It's that it was on every other TV show in the world. It got huge. I mean, that was big.

1691
02:29:08,720 --> 02:29:21,720
Yeah, I caught wind of it on Fox myself. Second thing I was going to throw out there to you is Portsmouth, Arkansas, has got an international guard base, which has been running fighter planes for the past 30 or 40 years.

1692
02:29:21,720 --> 02:29:30,720
And they had a general come in a couple of weeks ago, and they're going to take away the manned aircraft and give us the unmanned aircraft now.

1693
02:29:30,720 --> 02:29:39,720
Stay there. I want to break this down because it ties into the economy. I'm going to come back to you, then I'm going to cover news, then I'm going to go back to calls.

1694
02:29:39,720 --> 02:29:49,720
But John in Arkansas, stay there. Listen, the entire military force is going to go to robots, not just the aircraft. Everything. It's the official plan.

1695
02:29:49,720 --> 02:30:00,720
We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

1712
02:33:00,720 --> 02:33:26,720
We are on the march. The empire is on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

1713
02:33:26,720 --> 02:33:37,720
All right, I'm going to go through a ton of news here in a moment, but I want to segue into the financial news off of what this caller John in Arkansas is talking about.

1714
02:33:37,720 --> 02:33:49,720
And I've seen the reports all over the place where they're talking about, oh, yeah, we're getting rid of the F-16s.

1715
02:33:49,720 --> 02:33:56,720
We're getting rid of the F-18s, whatever the case is, and it's all going to drone.

1716
02:33:56,720 --> 02:34:01,720
And I'm going to tie that in to the rest of the economy and where this is all going.

1717
02:34:01,720 --> 02:34:12,720
But the globalists have said on record in things like Wired magazine with Bill Joy that I've talked about probably 300 times since the April issue 2000,

1718
02:34:12,720 --> 02:34:22,720
where he said, yeah, I went to a meeting of a couple hundred top computer company owners and our debate was, do we just give you games and fun things to play and make you a bunch of idiots?

1719
02:34:22,720 --> 02:34:29,720
But let you keep destroying the resources or do we kill everybody? And the consensus is we're going to kill everybody.

1720
02:34:29,720 --> 02:34:39,720
So I'm just going to tell you that what the Unabomber said was right. Once this technocracy takes over, humans will be obsolete.

1721
02:34:39,720 --> 02:34:48,720
And you see, if you read that by one guy who's worth I don't know how many billions of dollars and a top software engineer and everything, you're like, oh, that's one guy.

1722
02:34:48,720 --> 02:34:53,720
That's all they talk about. That's what all their books talk about. It's what they joke about.

1723
02:34:53,720 --> 02:34:59,720
It's Ted Turner talks about it. Bill Gates, all of them.

1724
02:34:59,720 --> 02:35:10,720
And, you know, I see the general public hardworking people in this system who've paid and worked to build this system, but still very childlike.

1725
02:35:10,720 --> 02:35:16,720
And they just have no idea that we've we've built the house of the New World Order.

1726
02:35:16,720 --> 02:35:24,720
And when they're done building the house completely and they're and they're hanging the paintings up right now, they're you know, they're getting ready to put the vase on the central table and put flowers in it.

1727
02:35:24,720 --> 02:35:29,720
And they're turning towards us, the workers that built it. They're like, we don't want you in the house.

1728
02:35:29,720 --> 02:35:34,720
And the house is the whole planet. We're like, what does that mean? You see these men in black uniforms?

1729
02:35:34,720 --> 02:35:40,720
They're going to escort you. And then they look to the men in black uniforms after you're done escorting him out, shoot him in the back of the head.

1730
02:35:40,720 --> 02:35:49,720
You see these robots right here? They're going to escort you. And you know what? The guys in black uniforms are going to go with them because it's a religion of serving tyranny.

1731
02:35:49,720 --> 02:35:58,720
Each psychopath worships the psychopath above them. And it's very, very sad. I mean, I know the plan they're trying to build.

1732
02:35:58,720 --> 02:36:07,720
They've written countless books and white papers on it. I know where we're going. And the Pentagon said in the 70s that by 2010, you can look this up.

1733
02:36:07,720 --> 02:36:14,720
They wanted to convert everything to drones or half the force to drones. And then now they've got reports out.

1734
02:36:14,720 --> 02:36:24,720
We're on schedule by 2020. We want the entire combat force to be drone, autonomous operated. And we're talking seven years away.

1735
02:36:24,720 --> 02:36:32,720
And they're coming out with combat robots on the ground that have been classified. But now they're declassifying what I was told about by Marine Corps sources.

1736
02:36:32,720 --> 02:36:46,720
I mean, folks, I had Marines march in to access television in 1999, one month after I got back from Operation Urban Warrior.

1737
02:36:46,720 --> 02:36:56,720
Because they had a family member who had a show down there. I'm not going to say who. They're probably even listening.

1738
02:36:56,720 --> 02:37:05,720
And they came in with a VHS that they dumped off as a feed. And they said, we just want you to know you were under surveillance the whole time you were there.

1739
02:37:05,720 --> 02:37:18,720
And I said, can I show this? They said, obviously not. And it was a drone watching us, but also simulating killing militias outside of the big public drills in Oakland, San Francisco, where they were doing gun confiscation drills.

1740
02:37:18,720 --> 02:37:35,720
They knew we were coming, so they wrote us into the simulation as terrorists. And they had Navy SEALs simulating like they were terrorist militias trying to come up in rubber dinghies and stuff to fight the US military.

1741
02:37:35,720 --> 02:37:49,720
I mean, this country's so gone. I mean, that's what I mean. And it's like, can I please show people this? And they're like, no. But that was 14 years ago, and they were calling the drone over us Death Star.

1742
02:37:49,720 --> 02:38:05,720
Because it even had the audio chatter of EC2, fly 4000 feet, move into operation, Death Star, Death Star. And it would cut to different feeds of different drones. And they're like, okay, you got to see that. Bye.

1743
02:38:05,720 --> 02:38:14,720
We're not all bad guys, but we snuck out to show you that and then took the video and left. The point is, this has been going on for so long.

1744
02:38:14,720 --> 02:38:25,720
And they're using our energy and our work. The best analogy of this is, I lived in a middle class neighborhood.

1745
02:38:25,720 --> 02:38:29,720
I don't know, seven years ago.

1746
02:38:29,720 --> 02:38:44,720
And so many stalkers came to my house. We moved. I mean, I wasn't particularly afraid of them. I mean, my wife and I were just going to have to defend ourselves and air them out if they ever actually came in the house, actually have to defend ourselves, didn't want to have to do that.

1747
02:38:44,720 --> 02:39:00,720
And so we moved. But the point was, most of the friends I knew in the area were engineers with IBM and advanced micro devices and things. And they had the two degrees from the University of Texas or the degree from MIT and then another degree.

1748
02:39:00,720 --> 02:39:20,720
And they were all there, really smart people, worked their whole life to live in little four bedroom houses. I'd say it was lower middle class because, you know, the idea of middle class is having a nice car. No, I mean, middle class is making $100,000 a year, bare minimum or more.

1749
02:39:20,720 --> 02:39:32,720
They'll say that's the upper echelon. $100,000 isn't worth what it used to be. And I'm gonna go back to you, Serge. I just am now kind of on a roll telling the story, at least in my own mind.

1750
02:39:32,720 --> 02:39:42,720
And I ran into those guys, all of them, one time or another on the streets of Austin, ran into some of them a few weeks ago on the hike and bike trail.

1751
02:39:42,720 --> 02:39:57,720
And when I lived by all these engineers, it was mainly engineers in the neighborhood for whatever reason, they were all training their Indian counterparts who would work for a third as much and who were given visas to come in.

1752
02:39:57,720 --> 02:40:06,720
And then the last time I talked to them, the Indians have been let go because they can just build it in China and they've got computers doing the diagnostics running it.

1753
02:40:06,720 --> 02:40:17,720
And listen, I get the whole thing of, well, that's just technology humans aren't needed, but the government isn't trying to find things for us to do or having a big space program or having, you know, other things.

1754
02:40:17,720 --> 02:40:26,720
They're setting up an agenda 21 just to get rid of human society. And so let me just make the announcement to all of you.

1755
02:40:26,720 --> 02:40:42,720
The establishment has said on record that they're going to establish world government, they're going to set taxes to a point that are selectively enforced to consolidate the wealth in less than 20 families and less than 6000 super minions.

1756
02:40:42,720 --> 02:40:58,720
That's what Rothkopp at the Kissinger Group calls it in his book, Superclass. 6000 super govers, about 19 families, they're going to consolidate everything and then they're going to set up police state control grids.

1757
02:40:58,720 --> 02:41:09,720
And those are just to do the orderly bio weapons releasing. And look, I know most of you won't listen now. I understand that. New listeners, you will when this all happens.

1758
02:41:09,720 --> 02:41:18,720
See, I'm setting time bombs into the future against these people. OK, that's all that matters to me is that is that humanity make it out of this.

1759
02:41:18,720 --> 02:41:30,720
That which doesn't kill us all only make the species stronger. I understand the decadence. I understand all the fact that humanity is rotting, but the globalist aren't trying to make us stronger with adversity.

1760
02:41:30,720 --> 02:41:45,720
They are ultimately selfish and greedy, inbred and very unhappy themselves. And all they do is fantasize and talk about the great time that's coming and the world without us and how they're going to live.

1761
02:41:45,720 --> 02:42:00,720
For hundreds of years, and then they can do that, they can live basically eternally, how they're going to copy their consciousnesses into all these other biological androids, how they are going to blast their consciousness. It's not just Ray Kurzweil, it's all of them.

1762
02:42:00,720 --> 02:42:11,720
Often to the cosmos and how they will soon achieve godhood will be like a bug and then we don't matter and that they're just going to kill everybody.

1763
02:42:11,720 --> 02:42:21,720
And so they've accepted this is the evolutionary curve of humanity. They've decided this is what it is. They discovered genetics because they wanted the keys to this.

1764
02:42:21,720 --> 02:42:27,720
They financed all the science, all of our modern sciences came out of eugenics. This is our world.

1765
02:42:27,720 --> 02:42:46,720
And I am the obsolete man. You are the obsolete man to them and they enjoy hurting even the best of us. They're not surface eugenics. They want to make humanity stronger, live longer, be better, get rid of the dumb down, get rid of the sick, get rid of the ugly, all the rest of this.

1766
02:42:46,720 --> 02:43:03,720
But you always know it ends up being everybody. The truth is just an excuse to play god, play mad scientist and really hurt people bad because they've tried to dumb people down and tried to lower their horizons and tried to make people these addled, mind controlled, and those aren't words, that's real.

1767
02:43:03,720 --> 02:43:20,720
In a trance, drooling fools. It's just a horrible, horrible vandalism. I mean, it really hurts me bad to see all the lost opportunity and to see how they've hurt us all and made us all so ugly and poisoned.

1768
02:43:20,720 --> 02:43:35,720
And also they can be top dogs. So yeah, they're going to shut down all the military bases when they're done and the bases will be robot factories.

1769
02:43:35,720 --> 02:43:53,720
And then your money will be paid under national security into it. Japan's already putting robot police on street corners to surveil people just to get you conditioned to it. The really hardcore combat robots don't so much look like C3PO or something out of.

1770
02:43:53,720 --> 02:44:05,720
I'll just put it to you this way. All the stuff you see in the Terminator stuff, that's art imitating life. That's the kind of stuff from my Marine Corps sources and then some others.

1771
02:44:05,720 --> 02:44:15,720
Where I was given highly classified information about 14 years ago by a Marine Corps officer.

1772
02:44:15,720 --> 02:44:24,720
Who I just happened to run into, and that was the only time and I later looked the person up and indeed it was who they said they were. And man, they got stuff right out of judgment day folks.

1773
02:44:24,720 --> 02:44:36,720
They've got like wheeled tanks that are like small, the size of a four wheel with all these guns, and then they'll have like a big skull head on top of it just to scare people.

1774
02:44:36,720 --> 02:44:50,720
So it looks like something out of judgment. It's going to be horrible, man. And again, they're going to phase out the pilots. Then they're going to have humans already controlling everything with the computers, watching them learning in a simulator to learn everything.

1775
02:44:50,720 --> 02:44:59,720
And then humans are already being unplugged from them, and they're autonomous things that are then programmed by master programmers. And I know I've talked a lot about this.

1776
02:44:59,720 --> 02:45:10,720
It's just that the robots that were described to me, this guy told me about a thing that looks like the size of a large Ford truck with a sloped front with a bunch of guns on the front.

1777
02:45:10,720 --> 02:45:18,720
With solar panels, but also with batteries in it that can be delivered out of the back of a 18 wheeler.

1778
02:45:18,720 --> 02:45:31,720
And then like five years after he told me about this in the Honolulu Advertiser, they showed the thing he described and said that the Marines displayed it, but didn't give details.

1779
02:45:31,720 --> 02:45:44,720
He told me a lot of it's just psyops. Like he said, the plan is to start deploying robots that are really just surveillance pods with cameras and stuff because they don't want them to hurt anybody up front.

1780
02:45:44,720 --> 02:45:54,720
So they'll mainly just be like a toy, a pre-programmed toy that stays within a little box on the street corner and runs feeds and then makes announcements for humans through it.

1781
02:45:54,720 --> 02:46:02,720
Because they want humans to be sold on it and how it's a great thing. Humans will sit back and I was told about this and then happened a few years later.

1782
02:46:02,720 --> 02:46:11,720
Where there's a camera on the street pole, but then there's also a screen that has a person's face on it saying don't do that. I'm watching you.

1783
02:46:11,720 --> 02:46:16,720
And so humans will now, this is already in Tokyo, they will give orders through the robot.

1784
02:46:16,720 --> 02:46:25,720
Like a lot of these globalist bosses have a robot in their office when they're in a different city or different country and the robot rolls around with a camera and stuff on it.

1785
02:46:25,720 --> 02:46:34,720
And it oversees everybody and it's the boss. And then a human uses that to have a physical presence through the suit.

1786
02:46:34,720 --> 02:46:42,720
And again, they're going to have humans as backup in the combat suits and you see it all in the movies.

1787
02:46:42,720 --> 02:46:48,720
They're just getting everybody ready for it. Yeah, well you guys show the new Tyranus drone.

1788
02:46:48,720 --> 02:46:59,720
It was something like, just type in danger of robot wars, click news. It's London Guardian, London Telegraph I think yesterday and it shows their new system Tyranus.

1789
02:46:59,720 --> 02:47:04,720
Yeah, let's have something called the Tyrant. That's a really good name for it because that's what it is.

1790
02:47:04,720 --> 02:47:23,720
And we pay for it, we build it and then soon, just like the IBM engineers and others and Dell engineers and everybody else, they are just rolling all this out.

1791
02:47:23,720 --> 02:47:34,720
They go train their human replacements and then the human replacements train computer diagnostic systems where it's just a technician and then the engineers are just out of the game.

1792
02:47:34,720 --> 02:47:42,720
But see, that wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't all designed like that, designed to take your job, designed to take your future.

1793
02:47:42,720 --> 02:47:46,720
And that's what ties into this. I mean punchupdrugreport.com for folks up there.

1794
02:47:46,720 --> 02:47:57,720
While they're busy with reports of Fed's probe for new MLB doping scandal, New York Times A-Rod named in books of anti-aging clinic, CBS on Lance Armstrong.

1795
02:47:57,720 --> 02:48:03,720
He'd like to think it's over but it's not. See, let's fry some little people and make you think we're getting the corrupt.

1796
02:48:03,720 --> 02:48:07,720
You know, Martha Stewart while Congress insider trades, but look at the Dow Jones Industrial.

1797
02:48:07,720 --> 02:48:16,720
$13,960, it's getting close to. $14,000, that's because the dollar's been so devalued it takes more dollars to buy it.

1798
02:48:16,720 --> 02:48:25,720
It's a total hoax. But see, everything is a hoax. Fed shut down coal plants, heat capital with coal.

1799
02:48:25,720 --> 02:48:30,720
Well, yeah, they're not going to have, you know, they're not going to not have power.

1800
02:48:30,720 --> 02:48:39,720
Illegal immigration on the rise again. Yeah. And again, it's meant to bankrupt us.

1801
02:48:39,720 --> 02:48:45,720
Payroll tax saps consumer confidence hitting poor Americans.

1802
02:48:45,720 --> 02:48:58,720
See, this is all the giant scam. And it's so painful to watch all this unfold and to know it's an engineered scientific fraud that Eisenhower.

1803
02:48:58,720 --> 02:49:06,720
You know, he didn't just warn about the military industrial complex. He talked about the scientific and technocratic elite that control it because he'd been around them.

1804
02:49:06,720 --> 02:49:13,720
They came to Eisenhower and said, we're going to set up a world government and kill everybody. We have a long term 50 year plan.

1805
02:49:13,720 --> 02:49:20,720
Oh, you found Tyrannus. Yeah, go back up to the top of that. I want to read the name of it.

1806
02:49:20,720 --> 02:49:23,720
It's named after the Celtic god of thunder.

1807
02:49:23,720 --> 02:49:28,720
That may be a different one. Warns of robot wars. Or how do you say that?

1808
02:49:28,720 --> 02:49:30,720
Tyrannus.

1809
02:49:30,720 --> 02:49:33,720
Tyrannus, which I guess.

1810
02:49:33,720 --> 02:49:37,720
Most Celtic god of thunder.

1811
02:49:37,720 --> 02:49:42,720
It's all a sick joke. I must have misread it. It wasn't Tyrannus.

1812
02:49:42,720 --> 02:49:46,720
Oh, man, help me. OK, I'm going to shut up, caller. John Arkansas, finish up your point.

1813
02:49:46,720 --> 02:49:54,720
You just got a whole dissertation on that. So you've got the new robot system there in your area. How are people liking that?

1814
02:49:54,720 --> 02:50:04,720
Well, they just announced that they're going to do it. We still got the ATMs here right now, but they said they said the manless planes are coming to get ready for it.

1815
02:50:04,720 --> 02:50:11,720
Well, yeah, you can't have pilots making decisions. It's got to be robots controlled by globalist.

1816
02:50:11,720 --> 02:50:18,720
What else is on your mind, brother?

1817
02:50:18,720 --> 02:50:24,720
He might have dropped off. I put him on hold so he could finish up his point. Anyways, I answered his question. Thank you so much, John.

1818
02:50:24,720 --> 02:50:31,720
And again, I get up here and just rattle off all this. I wish it wasn't true. I wish I wasn't having to tell you this.

1819
02:50:31,720 --> 02:50:36,720
The plan is to make everything automated, and it's called a technocracy.

1820
02:50:36,720 --> 02:50:42,720
The globalists like Zbigniew Brzezinski call themselves technocrats. I mean, they're so arrogant.

1821
02:50:42,720 --> 02:50:50,720
They have introduced legislation where the Congress and the government bureaucrats are exempt and can have any guns they want.

1822
02:50:50,720 --> 02:50:55,720
But you turn yours in. I mean, come on. We've got to wake up to the full horror.

1823
02:50:55,720 --> 02:51:10,720
We've got to remove these criminals and have a public debate about the technocracy.

1824
02:51:25,720 --> 02:51:30,720
Every year we accumulate a few solar generators that we just can't sell as new.

1825
02:51:30,720 --> 02:51:36,720
We put them in a special spot in our warehouse and we discount them heavily at the end of each year.

1826
02:51:36,720 --> 02:51:40,720
We call them scratch and dent units, but they're really just like new.

1827
02:51:40,720 --> 02:51:45,720
Each unit comes with a full factory warranty and special bonuses you just won't believe.

1828

1838

Hey there. Frank Bates here.

1839
02:53:03,720 --> 02:53:08,720
Have you heard about the weird device that could wipe out 280 million Americans?

1840
02:53:08,720 --> 02:53:10,720
This is really scary stuff.

1841
02:53:10,720 --> 02:53:15,720
Defense experts warn that this odd device poses the gravest threat we've ever known.

1842
02:53:15,720 --> 02:53:21,720
In fact, just a few weeks ago, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich wrote an op-ed piece for the Washington Post

1843
02:53:21,720 --> 02:53:23,720
warning about this deadly threat.

1844
02:53:23,720 --> 02:53:26,720
I can't believe that more people aren't talking about this.

1845
02:53:26,720 --> 02:53:30,720
It may be because the liberals and the government are trying to cover it up.

1846
02:53:30,720 --> 02:53:34,720
That's why my friend just created a free video at weirddevice.com

1847
02:53:34,720 --> 02:53:38,720
that exposes this threat and blows the doors off the conspiracy.

1848
02:53:38,720 --> 02:53:44,720
Go watch the shocking video at weirddevice.com right now to discover exactly what it is

1849
02:53:44,720 --> 02:53:49,720
plus discover the number one way you and your family can survive this deadly attack.

1850
02:53:49,720 --> 02:53:54,720
I'm not sure how long this video will be online, so go to weirddevice.com before it's gone forever.

1851
02:53:54,720 --> 02:53:57,720
Again, that's weirddevice.com.

1852
02:54:03,720 --> 02:54:07,720
I mean, folks, we need treaties right now to not go to robot systems

1853
02:54:07,720 --> 02:54:13,720
because it allows tiny elites to countermand common sense by the officers and do war crimes.

1854
02:54:13,720 --> 02:54:16,720
Imagine if Hitler, what about an army of robots?

1855
02:54:16,720 --> 02:54:20,720
He basically did, a bunch of people that followed his orders, but this is worse than that.

1856
02:54:20,720 --> 02:54:24,720
By the way, Al Sharpton's out. The video's up at infowars.com

1857
02:54:24,720 --> 02:54:27,720
saying, you know, you basically don't have a Second Amendment.

1858
02:54:27,720 --> 02:54:30,720
But I mentioned this all day talking about the economy.

1859
02:54:30,720 --> 02:54:34,720
They're getting rid of the economy to make you dependent on government.

1860
02:54:34,720 --> 02:54:39,720
And because of mass production, they can still have robotic-type systems

1861
02:54:39,720 --> 02:54:43,720
from farming right through to manufacturing produce the baubles for you.

1862
02:54:43,720 --> 02:54:48,720
But it's all done to not just control a country or a culture, to control humans

1863
02:54:48,720 --> 02:54:52,720
because the globalists see us as a disease and a cancer.

1864
02:54:52,720 --> 02:54:55,720
And you run into all these people, you know, who are well-meaning,

1865
02:54:55,720 --> 02:54:58,720
Joe Rogan, Jesse Ventura, they go, well, there are too many of us.

1866
02:54:58,720 --> 02:55:00,720
Okay, are you going to kill your family?

1867
02:55:00,720 --> 02:55:05,720
You see, the point is, is that this program is going on.

1868
02:55:05,720 --> 02:55:09,720
Sure, I see a bunch of lazy slobs out there, a bunch of welfare queens.

1869
02:55:09,720 --> 02:55:13,720
That was done to make them weak so they could then be destroyed,

1870
02:55:13,720 --> 02:55:17,720
so they could be used as a horde of people to take my rights away

1871
02:55:17,720 --> 02:55:20,720
by voting my Second Amendment away.

1872
02:55:20,720 --> 02:55:23,720
They bring the illegal aliens in from Mexico, let them vote.

1873
02:55:23,720 --> 02:55:27,720
The Republicans are saying, this is how we'll win, it's unbelievable.

1874
02:55:27,720 --> 02:55:32,720
Here's this clip from Davos of the president of Iceland

1875
02:55:32,720 --> 02:55:36,720
saying, how did we turn our economy around when nobody else could?

1876
02:55:36,720 --> 02:55:38,720
Well, we didn't owe this debt.

1877
02:55:38,720 --> 02:55:41,720
It was all the foreign bankers' debt they'd had their people sign on.

1878
02:55:41,720 --> 02:55:43,720
They arrested the head bankers.

1879
02:55:43,720 --> 02:55:45,720
It turned out it was all a fraud, just like in America.

1880
02:55:45,720 --> 02:55:48,720
Most of the debt isn't ours. Let's play that clip.

1881
02:55:48,720 --> 02:55:53,720
Well, so far, the only bit of hope that's come out of this Davos conference this year

1882
02:55:53,720 --> 02:55:58,720
is from the Icelandic president who's standing alongside me, Olafur Ragnar Grimsson.

1883
02:55:58,720 --> 02:56:01,720
Mr. President, why are you such a beacon of hope?

1884
02:56:01,720 --> 02:56:05,720
Why has Iceland survived where Europe has failed?

1885
02:56:05,720 --> 02:56:06,720
What are you doing differently?

1886
02:56:06,720 --> 02:56:09,720
I think it surprises a lot of people that four years ago

1887
02:56:09,720 --> 02:56:14,720
we were accepted number one of a failed financial system.

1888
02:56:14,720 --> 02:56:19,720
But now we are back on recovery with economic growth and very little unemployment.

1889
02:56:19,720 --> 02:56:23,720
And I think the primary reason is that we were wise enough

1890
02:56:23,720 --> 02:56:27,720
to realise this was also a fundamental social and political crisis.

1891
02:56:27,720 --> 02:56:34,720
But above all, we didn't follow the traditional prevailing orthodoxies

1892
02:56:34,720 --> 02:56:37,720
of the Western world in the last 30 years.

1893
02:56:37,720 --> 02:56:41,720
We introduced currency controls. We let the banks fail.

1894
02:56:41,720 --> 02:56:44,720
We provided support for the poor.

1895
02:56:44,720 --> 02:56:49,720
We didn't introduce austerity measures of the scale you're seeing here in Europe.

1896
02:56:49,720 --> 02:56:56,720
And the end result four years later is that Iceland is enjoying progress and recovery

1897
02:56:56,720 --> 02:57:00,720
very different from the other European countries that suffered from the financial crisis.

1898
02:57:00,720 --> 02:57:01,720
That's enough.

1899
02:57:01,720 --> 02:57:04,720
And the key to the whole thing is

1900
02:57:04,720 --> 02:57:10,720
93% of the debt that they were told was theirs was actually foreign banks.

1901
02:57:10,720 --> 02:57:12,720
So they just arrested the people.

1902
02:57:12,720 --> 02:57:14,720
That's what you're supposed to do. You're supposed to arrest them.

1903
02:57:14,720 --> 02:57:16,720
The globalists have signed us onto their debt.

1904
02:57:16,720 --> 02:57:19,720
But see, the globalists want our guns to make sure we're really their property

1905
02:57:19,720 --> 02:57:23,720
to prop up their debt so they can hold us hostage, saying too big to fail.

1906
02:57:23,720 --> 02:57:27,720
We fail if we tie ourselves to this bowling ball and jump into the ocean.

1907
02:57:27,720 --> 02:57:31,720
Here's Al Sharpton on your constitution and your guns.

1908
02:57:31,720 --> 02:57:33,720
I mean, if you look at the Second Amendment,

1909
02:57:33,720 --> 02:57:40,720
it was that you would have militia to protect yourself in case the government came and attacked citizens.

1910
02:57:40,720 --> 02:57:44,720
First of all, if the government were to come to disarm you,

1911
02:57:44,720 --> 02:57:48,720
you would not be able to use an automatic weapon to defend yourself.

1912
02:57:48,720 --> 02:57:51,720
Let's be serious. We're in a world of drones now.

1913
02:57:51,720 --> 02:57:56,720
So the Second Amendment would not help you in that area.

1914
02:57:56,720 --> 02:58:00,720
We're talking about people do not have the right to unregulated rights.

1915
02:58:00,720 --> 02:58:03,720
All right, let's stop right there. There you go.

1916
02:58:03,720 --> 02:58:05,720
You do not have the right to unregulated rights.

1917
02:58:05,720 --> 02:58:07,720
Folks, see, it's all about the drone.

1918
02:58:07,720 --> 02:58:09,720
By the way, the globalists couldn't hold Baghdad.

1919
02:58:09,720 --> 02:58:11,720
They couldn't hold Afghanistan. That's another.

1920
02:58:11,720 --> 02:58:14,720
But the left, as they're authoritarians, always says,

1921
02:58:14,720 --> 02:58:16,720
we got the drones now.

1922
02:58:16,720 --> 02:58:19,720
Listen, you can't stand up against us.

1923
02:58:19,720 --> 02:58:22,720
So forget the Second Amendment being for the government.

1924
02:58:22,720 --> 02:58:24,720
We got more force than you now. No, you don't.

1925
02:58:24,720 --> 02:58:27,720
And you don't have the moral right.

1926
02:58:27,720 --> 02:58:30,720
Al Sharpton is literally another gutter rat,

1927
02:58:30,720 --> 02:58:33,720
just like Chuck Schumer and all these other gangster scum.

1928
02:58:33,720 --> 02:58:36,720
A little bit of overdrive and take your calls, but just amazing.

1929
02:58:36,720 --> 02:58:42,720
We've got to turn off the technocracy and pull the plug on this thing now.

1930
02:58:42,720 --> 02:58:46,720

1932
02:59:16,720 --> 02:59:20,720
Just released is our 100% natural silver gel.

1933
02:59:20,720 --> 02:59:24,720
Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents,

1934
02:59:24,720 --> 02:59:27,720
which quickly evaporate and leave the silver at the surface.

1935
02:59:27,720 --> 02:59:30,720
But rather, we have formulated our silver gel

1936
02:59:30,720 --> 02:59:33,720
using the natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera

1937
02:59:33,720 --> 02:59:36,720
to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin

1938
02:59:36,720 --> 02:59:39,720
while delivering the silver more effectively.

Coast to coast, direct from Austin.

1944
02:59:55,720 --> 03:00:00,720
You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.

1945
03:00:05,720 --> 03:00:10,720
Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups.

1946
03:00:10,720 --> 03:00:13,720
You want answers? Well, so does he.

1947
03:00:13,720 --> 03:00:17,720
He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.

1948
03:00:17,720 --> 03:00:22,720
And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.

1949
03:00:31,720 --> 03:00:34,720
Alright, taking some calls here in overdrive.

1950
03:00:34,720 --> 03:00:37,720
And I hear the stuff I'm talking about on this show

1951
03:00:37,720 --> 03:00:39,720
and it sounds crazy, but it's all admitted.

1952
03:00:39,720 --> 03:00:42,720
I mean, the globalists are just absolutely conquering us

1953
03:00:42,720 --> 03:00:44,720
and they're running this hoax that

1954
03:00:44,720 --> 03:00:48,720
Republicans now understand we need to be for total socialism

1955
03:00:48,720 --> 03:00:51,720
and open borders and that's what will get the Republicans elected.

1956
03:00:51,720 --> 03:00:54,720
Well, good, who needs to get you elected then?

1957
03:00:54,720 --> 03:00:57,720
It's all election fraud. It's all scams now.

1958
03:00:57,720 --> 03:01:00,720
They just want to convince you to turn your guns in.

1959
03:01:00,720 --> 03:01:05,720
I mean, we just got to wake up and we got taken over or it's all over.

1960
03:01:05,720 --> 03:01:08,720
Mike in Illinois, you're on the air. Go ahead.

1961
03:01:08,720 --> 03:01:11,720
Hey, Alex. Great. I'm glad you're here. Glad you took my call.

1962
03:01:11,720 --> 03:01:15,720
I don't know if you're aware of the National Institute of Standards and Technology's

1963
03:01:15,720 --> 03:01:18,720
Freedom of Information Act that they just sued for.

1964
03:01:18,720 --> 03:01:21,720
They've been on YouTube for about two years, a little bit less,

1965
03:01:21,720 --> 03:01:24,720
but I've been doing a lot of troving and searching.

1966
03:01:24,720 --> 03:01:29,720
And if you look up the CBS-net dub buyers of World Trade Center

1967
03:01:29,720 --> 03:01:35,720
between 340 and 410, you will see the streets of Greenwich and Barclay

1968
03:01:35,720 --> 03:01:38,720
full of nothing but exploded automobiles.

1969
03:01:38,720 --> 03:01:43,720
Yeah, I don't know what happened to the over a thousand automobiles that got toasted.

1970
03:01:43,720 --> 03:01:48,720
We've talked a lot about the toasted cars since September 12th when I noticed them.

1971
03:01:48,720 --> 03:01:51,720
And I've talked about building seven, the controlled demolition.

1972
03:01:51,720 --> 03:01:55,720
I mean, everybody focuses on mystery. Everybody loves a mystery like toasted cars.

1973
03:01:55,720 --> 03:01:58,720
What about the police saying, get back there, bringing seven down

1974
03:01:58,720 --> 03:02:04,720
and BBC and CNN reporting building seven had fallen an hour before it fell into its own footprint.

1975
03:02:04,720 --> 03:02:09,720
I mean, what about NORAD standing down? What about Panetta's testimony?

1976
03:02:09,720 --> 03:02:12,720
Transportation Secretary that Cheney ordered to stand down.

1977
03:02:12,720 --> 03:02:14,720
What about the head of the U.S. embassies?

1978
03:02:14,720 --> 03:02:17,720
People saying they were ordered to let the hijackers back in the U.S.

1979
03:02:17,720 --> 03:02:19,720
and that they were trained at U.S. military bases.

1980
03:02:19,720 --> 03:02:23,720
What about Al Qaeda being flown out to safety after the Afghan stage war?

1981
03:02:23,720 --> 03:02:25,720
Just amazing.

1982
03:02:25,720 --> 03:02:29,720
Oh, no, I agree. I mean, if you take a look at those videos, start trolling through them,

1983
03:02:29,720 --> 03:02:33,720
you're going to see how those buildings were on fire for two or three floors

1984
03:02:33,720 --> 03:02:35,720
and not on fire for two or three floors.

1985
03:02:35,720 --> 03:02:39,720
And as you get to the bottom, there was a CBS cameraman, and I believe his first name was Vince,

1986
03:02:39,720 --> 03:02:43,720
that you should probably look up and find out what happened to him and get him on your show

1987
03:02:43,720 --> 03:02:45,720
because he'd be the last or the first person.

1988
03:02:45,720 --> 03:02:48,720
Well, look, look, look, I mean, we already know what I mean.

1989
03:02:48,720 --> 03:02:52,720
Look, the firefighters reported the fires were basically out in both buildings

1990
03:02:52,720 --> 03:02:56,720
or people standing, waving their hands with a handkerchief for help.

1991
03:02:56,720 --> 03:02:59,720
And then the column right next to him blows up.

1992
03:02:59,720 --> 03:03:04,720
I mean, I mean, they blew it sky high, criminal elements working with Al Qaeda,

1993
03:03:04,720 --> 03:03:06,720
so Al Qaeda would take the blame.

1994
03:03:06,720 --> 03:03:08,720
And then they run the Al Qaeda today.

1995
03:03:08,720 --> 03:03:14,720
I mean, it's just we keep just piling evidence on the official story is totally ridiculous.

1996
03:03:14,720 --> 03:03:15,720
And we know who had the motive.

1997
03:03:15,720 --> 03:03:19,720
Roy in Oklahoma, you're on the air. Go ahead.

1998
03:03:19,720 --> 03:03:22,720
Go ahead, Roy, you're on the air from Oklahoma.

1999
03:03:22,720 --> 03:03:29,720
Yeah, on the phone because I believe in our amendments and stuff and I ain't giving up my guns to nobody.

2000
03:03:29,720 --> 03:03:31,720
I hear you, your phone's not working too well.

2001
03:03:31,720 --> 03:03:33,720
Can you talk right into it?

2002
03:03:33,720 --> 03:03:35,720
Yeah.

2003
03:03:35,720 --> 03:03:37,720
Yeah, that'll work a lot better. Go ahead.

2004
03:03:37,720 --> 03:03:39,720
I ain't giving up my guns.

2005
03:03:39,720 --> 03:03:42,720
I don't expect anybody else to give up theirs.

2006
03:03:42,720 --> 03:03:48,720
You know, those amendments and the Constitution is there written for us from years and years ago,

2007
03:03:48,720 --> 03:03:50,720
and we need to stand up for it now.

2008
03:03:50,720 --> 03:03:53,720
I agree with you. We got to get aggressive, but here's the deal.

2009
03:03:53,720 --> 03:03:56,720
It's not just that. It's taken our money for the drone.

2010
03:03:56,720 --> 03:04:03,720
They got drone ships, drone police boats, drone submarines, tiny little drones that they're getting to watch us.

2011
03:04:03,720 --> 03:04:05,720
They're spying on us without warrants.

2012
03:04:05,720 --> 03:04:07,720
They're converting everything.

2013
03:04:07,720 --> 03:04:10,720
Smart meters that tie into all our appliances and control them.

2014
03:04:10,720 --> 03:04:12,720
I mean, this is diabolical.

2015
03:04:12,720 --> 03:04:16,720
This is a science fiction movie, and it's about to get worse.

2016
03:04:16,720 --> 03:04:18,720
We've got to wake up now.

2017
03:04:18,720 --> 03:04:21,720
Yeah, they're building drones right here in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma right now.

2018
03:04:21,720 --> 03:04:24,720
Look like little helicopters for the police.

2019
03:04:24,720 --> 03:04:26,720
I know. It's just hellish.

2020
03:04:26,720 --> 03:04:30,720
And everybody's a warrior, and the warriors are going to fight our wives and children.

2021
03:04:30,720 --> 03:04:33,720
They're such tough guys, but they're all dead already, too.

2022
03:04:33,720 --> 03:04:35,720
They're all taking deadly shots, drinking fluoride.

2023
03:04:35,720 --> 03:04:40,720
That's why I can't even get mad at the stupid enforcers, because they're just walking dead.

2024
03:04:40,720 --> 03:04:42,720
I mean, that's what I mean.

2025
03:04:42,720 --> 03:04:46,720
We're so into this, so deep into the nightmare.

2026
03:04:46,720 --> 03:04:48,720
How do you wake people up?

2027
03:04:48,720 --> 03:04:50,720
That's why the globalists haven't killed me.

2028
03:04:50,720 --> 03:04:52,720
It's all a big program, an experiment.

2029
03:04:52,720 --> 03:04:55,720
And they just let me sit here, and they use me as like a radar ping.

2030
03:04:55,720 --> 03:04:57,720
It's just all scientifically established.

2031
03:04:57,720 --> 03:04:59,720
It's unbelievably diabolical.

2032
03:04:59,720 --> 03:05:17,720
Oh, man.
