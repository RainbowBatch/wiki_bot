1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,720
Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does

2
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:12,720
he.

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,840
All right, ladies and gentlemen, we interrupt the normal intro to the broadcast to bring

4
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:24,720
you the would-be dictator-in-chief, shamelessly exploiting children, looking like a bad guy

5
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:31,980
of a dystopic movie, Barack Obama up there with the other thug, gangster Joe Biden, just

6
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,000
getting ready with 23 executive actions.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,160
And yes, they're now leaking, and he's about to announce it. They're gonna go after gun

8
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,480
owners. They're gonna try to ban our ammo. They're gonna try to make you register. They're

9
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,160
gonna try to make you come turn your guns in. They are gonna release hell on us and

10
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:55,160
try to get a bunch of bans passed in Congress on top of it. So it's on.

11
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:59,920
First they take your guns, then they take your property, then they take your children,

12
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,040
then they put you in a forced labor camp, then they take your life. And they are collapsing

13
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:08,840
America. You see the militarization of police. Dressing like Darth Vader, you see the 1.6

14
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:13,680
million bullets. We are going into a total collapse and they wanna get our guns beforehand,

15
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,120
or at least say all gun owners are terrorists.

16
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:20,560
This is the way they're gonna designate conservatives and libertarians the enemy. This is the plan.

17
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:26,520
We've got to impeach now. I take you to the scumbag in chief, the fraud, the New World

18
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,120
Order minion that's gutting this country and raising taxes on poor people to mercilessly

19
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,120
bankrupt them.

20
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:37,960
They've got laws passed, so companies cut people's hours from 40 to 29. Just the man

21
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:44,480
who wants you bankrupt, Mr. agenda 21, himself using dead children. The sickening vampire,

22
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:51,200
the psychic vampire pig, Barack Hussein Obama with his other thug, Biden. Here it is.

23
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:57,680
One thing we can do to reduce this violence. If there's even one life that can be saved.

24
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,960
We've got to please Biden this.

25
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:04,720
Then we've got an obligation to try. Really, all the Prozac the kids are on? Number one

26
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:09,920
cause of death, now suicide, cuz you people putting 60 million people on psychotropics.

27
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:15,320
At that desk and I will sign a directive giving law enforcement, schools, mental health professionals

28
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:20,600
and the public health community some of the tools they need to help reduce gun violence.

29
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,720
The Federal Thought Police, it's the New York bill.

30
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,040
It will make it easier to keep guns out of the hands of criminals.

31
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,040
The New York bill.

32
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,480
By strengthening the background check system.

33
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,640
Oh really, this guy tried to get a gun five times.

34
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,520
We will help schools hire more resource officers.

35
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,520
And couldn't.

36
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,520
If they want them.

37
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,660
Resource officers to spy on the kids, not to protect them.

38
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:41,400
We will make sure mental health professionals know their options for reporting threats of

39
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,400
violence.

40
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,400
That's right.

41
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:48,160
Then the more more psychiatrists in the schools are more likely kids on psychotropics than

42
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,160
the perpetrator.

43
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,380
They're gonna stage more shootings.

44
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,380
They're behind it.

45
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,380
You can just see.

46
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,380
Year after year.

47
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:59,560
Those who oppose even modest gun safety measures have threatened to defund scientific or medical

48
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,560
research.

49
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,000
This guy has always said he wants to take all our guns.

50
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,560
They want all the guns.

51
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,720
It isn't reasonable what you want, you liar.

52
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,560
There's ways to reduce it.

53
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,960
And Congress should fund research into the effects that violent video games have on young

54
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,960
minds.

55
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,960
They'll never stop them.

56
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,440
We don't benefit from ignorance.

57
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:25,800
We don't benefit from not knowing the science of this epidemic of violence.

58
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,800
You know the science.

59
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,720
You know they were developed for murder fantasizing.

60
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:33,200
These are a few of the 23 executive actions that I'm announcing today.

61
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,200
But as important as these steps are.

62
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,760
You know they're murder simulators.

63
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,840
They are in no way a substitute for action for members of Congress.

64
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,020
You know they were given to the military so they'd kill up close.

65
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:45,520
To make a real and lasting difference.

66
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,280
Get the Prozac heads off the Prozac.

67
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,280
And Congress must act.

68
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,460
Stop pushing murder suicide pills.

69
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,460
You new world order scumbag.

70
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,460
I'm calling on Congress to pass some very specific proposals-

71
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,740
Take the floor out of the water.

72
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:56,740
Stop giving kids blue shots.

73
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:59,040
It's killing them.

74
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,040
Stop killing kids with drones all over the world.

75
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:04,320
First, it's time for Congress to require a universal background check for anyone trying

76
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,320
to buy a gun.

77
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,320
That means transferring it to your family.

78
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,320
That's right.

79
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,320
General control.

80
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,320
Shutting down.

81
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:13,280
And they're going to say guns are retroactively illegal.

82
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,280
That you legally bought.

83
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,280
Look at that parade in those little kids.

84
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,640
They're already required as licensed gun dealers to run background checks.

85
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:23,120
And over the last 14 years that's kept 1.5 million of the wrong people from getting their

86
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,700
hands on a gun.

87
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:31,880
But it's hard to enforce that law when as many as 40% of all gun purchases are conducted

88
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,880
without a background check.

89
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,880
Yeah, they're going to start raiding people.

90
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,880
They've already announced this.

91
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,880
That's not safe.

92
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,440
And saying your guns are illegal and saying where'd you get them?

93
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,680
It's not fair to responsible gun buyers or sellers.

94
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,800
And he's going to talk about expanding the size of the ATF.

95
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,880
If you want to buy a gun, whether it's from a licensed dealer or a private seller, you

96
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,800
should at least have to show you are not a felon.

97
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,800
We're going to break here.

98
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,800
We'll come back with more of the aftermath.

99
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,080
This is common sense.

100
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,640
You notice I'm wearing camo.

101
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,840
I'm part of the citizen militia.

102
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,260
I have a right to own guns.

103
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:08,560

Looking back on 2012 we ask ourselves how did we ever survive from natural disasters

129
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:09,520
like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on

130
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,400
by a disastrous economy.

131
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,100
Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything.

133
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,560
storm by having a supply of food on hand.

134
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,360
After Hurricane Sandy, Danny from New York City wrote, almost all of the grocery stores

135
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,160
are closed but I managed to get my eFoods just in time to be able to help my sister

136
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,160
and niece.

137
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,960
It is better to be prepared ten years too early than one day too late.

138
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,200
I can warn you but I can't feed you.

145
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:14,400
The right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.

146
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:20,440
It is the 16th day of January, 2013.

147
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:26,020
We have been watching and taking notes, it's exactly what we thought, 23 devastating attacks

148
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:30,360
with executive actions and executive orders on the Second Amendment.

149
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:35,420
Doctors are going to spy on people and report to the CPS.

150
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:39,800
If you own guns in the home, even though they're not illegal, they are to harass gun owners.

151
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,320
They are to swat team gun owners' homes.

152
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,160
If you sell a gun to any friends or family, they're gonna claim that's a felony.

153
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,840
They're gonna try to make you retroactively prove the providence of your guns.

154
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,200
They are going to try to put taxes on ammo.

155
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,120
They're gonna massively expand the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms so they can

156
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:00,320
ship more guns into Mexico to kill more people in false flags so they can blame the Second

157
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,440
Amendment.

158
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,520
He's rattling this all off while pimping out poor little children that he's exploiting

159
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:10,920
up there on the stage, knowing the federal government made the schools gun-free zones.

160
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:15,480
And then the media hyped, hey, an option for crazies on Prozac or other drugs who play

161
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,280
shoot-em-up games all day, go to the school and kill people.

162
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:24,840
And they're trying to put, collectively, the guilt of dead kids on us for our Second Amendment.

163
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:28,040
Because they want us to live like folks do in Chicago and New York with the highest crime

164
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,000
rates in the world.

165
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,320
Because the victims have been disarmed with thug cops everywhere, feeding on people along

166
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,800
with thugs in the streets.

167
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:40,000
Meanwhile, good cops all over the US in cities and towns saying, we're not gonna enforce

168
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,080
this, guns make us safer.

169
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,720
They want us to be like they are in other areas like Chicago and LA, where everybody

170
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,720
lives in fear.

171
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,400
And they're like in Oakland, big shoot-em-ups every night.

172
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,320
Because they're a mafia, let's go back to this thug exploiting these children.

173
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,560
When he swore to never go after our guns, here it is.

174
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:02,000
The only way we can change is if the American people demand it.

175
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
He wants to rally everybody.

176
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,880
And by the way, that doesn't just mean from certain parts of the country.

177
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,800
They're organizing on a jihad after our guns.

178
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:14,800
We're gonna need voices in those areas, in those congressional districts where the tradition

179
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,200
of gun ownership is strong.

180
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,200
The fight is on folks.

181
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,200
To speak up.

182
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,200
If they can take the guns, they can take everything.

183
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,000
They're gonna take the pension funds.

184
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,440
It can't just be the usual suspects.

185
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,760
They're gonna totally bankrupt us.

186
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,960
That's why they're militarizing the police, armored vehicles, billions of bullets.

187
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,960
We have to examine ourselves and our hearts.

188
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,960
Yeah, examine your hearts.

189
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,960
We have to examine ourselves.

190
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,480
Just cuz you got a peace prize and you're supposedly half black, doesn't mean you get

191
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,480
to be a dictator.

192
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,480
This will not happen unless the American people demand it.

193
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,160
All the stupid trendies think it's so cute.

194
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,160
Yeah, and you know what?

195
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,200
They put themselves in the moral high ground position knowing there's gonna be more mass

196
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,200
shootings.

197
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,840
And if they have to, they'll stage them.

198
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,840
Like Larry Pratt said.

199
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,840
Responsible gun owners, if Americans of every background stand up and say, enough.

200
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,680
If they'd staged fast and furious, they'd stage this.

201
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,800
They'd stage Aurora.

202
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:59,720
Too much pain and care too much about our children to allow this to continue, then change

203
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,720
will come.

204
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,840
Look at Biden.

205
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:08,640
That's what it's gonna take.

206
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:17,080
On the letter that Julia wrote me, she said, I know that laws have to be passed by Congress,

207
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:24,160
but I beg you to try very hard.

208
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,840
Julia I will try very hard.

209
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,400
Folks, this is so sick.

210
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,760
He's now looking at the little children.

211
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,240
Now the children are gonna tell us turn our guns in.

212
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,640
The government- They need to bring these proposals up for a vote.

213
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,640
Goes and says the kids say do this.

214
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,400
Make sure that they do.

215
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:45,560
Unbelievable the president rallying to overturn the Second Amendment and using five and six

216
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,560
year old children.

217
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,560
No background checks to keep guns out of the wrong place.

218
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,560
Fade that down.

219
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:54,080
Ask them if they- That's killing private transfer, giving guns as gifts, which they know.

220
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,920
Ladies and gentlemen, this government shipped guns into Mexico to cause carnage.

221
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,400
The CBS News got the memos to blame the Second Amendment.

222
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:05,080
They killed thousands over there, hundreds over here, including five police officers,

223
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,800
three of them border patrol, conservatively.

224
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,200
They are so cold blooded.

225
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,580
And these sweet little kids up there he's using, again, this is what Al Gore said a

226
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,580
few years ago.

227
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:18,320
He went to public schools and said, you heard the audio, you tell your parents pay carbon

228
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,320
taxes.

229
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,160
You tell them, you know best.

230
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:25,800
Every authoritarian society goes to the kids and says, you tell your parents what to do.

231
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,720
This is outrageous.

232
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:32,480
And so they handpicked kids' letters that have been mailed in, Million Mom March kids

233
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,480
and other people.

234
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,680
And then they sit there and display them and go, I'm gonna get the guns for you, little

235
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,680
kid.

236
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:41,080
And now you're against the little kids if you don't take the guns.

237
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,800
I mean, this is so transparent.

238
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:47,800
This is a guy that lied to everybody and said, I will not raise taxes unless you make a quarter

239
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,800
million a year.

240
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,240
And he raised it on people making 30,000 a year.

241
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:57,000
And even lower in some actuaries, Obama phone lady got her latest paycheck.

242
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,180
And they took even more out.

243
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:01,860
Everybody in my office gets more taken out now.

244
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,800
And that's just the beginning.

245
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,480
It's all these lies.

246
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:09,680
It's like being informed is like torturous.

247
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,680
Let's go back.

248
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:14,680
Let's go back right now back to the would be dictator who again is saying Congress needs

249
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,680
to do this.

250
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,680
But I do have-

251
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,680
The right to worship freely and safely.

252
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:23,040
That right was denied to Sikhs in Oak Creek, Wisconsin.

253
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,560
The right to assemble peaceably.

254
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,560
That right was denied-

255
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:31,640
Now he's saying the Second Amendment is attacking all our other rights.

256
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:35,760
No, the drug war has created a thug culture.

257
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,600
The giant prisons are colleges of crime.

258
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,240
And we've got guns that are holding your crime wave back.

259
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,240
Fading down.

260
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,240
That were denied.

261
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:48,240
We are holding your crime wave back and you hate the fact that crime using guns in the

262
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,920
last 16, 17 years has dropped 49%.

263
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,820
And that overall violent crimes dropped 21% fbi.gov.

264
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:58,160
Real local numbers compiled and filed.

265
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:02,200
You hate that concealed carry is pushing back your urban crime wave.

266
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:06,760
You hate the fact that people in big cities illegally have guns to protect themselves.

267
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,980
You hate it.

268
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:12,800
You want total control to do to us whatever you want, you gangster thug.

269
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:17,560
And that's why I've written a citizen's move.

270
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:22,000
And people ask me, well, how are you saying citizens, like citizen arrest?

271
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:28,280
I filed articles of impeachment publicly at prisonplanet.com and infowars.com that I wrote

272
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:32,240
last night in consultation with Paul Watson and Aaron Dykes.

273
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,800
Where I lay out where congressmen and others have shown we're in the Constitution.

274
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:40,000
Obama is done impeachable offenses clearly on their face.

275
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,040
Saying the UN runs our military and Congress isn't over war now.

276
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,480
Saying he can shut down coal power plants without a law, telling Congress to fly a kite.

277
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,480
Saying he can launch Libya and Syria attacks and telling Congress to go to hell.

278
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,120
Saying he's gonna have orders to restrict guns outside of law.

279
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,660
Running fast and furious, caught lying about that.

280
00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:00,200
It's all listed there and that's meant now to get that passed around.

281
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,800
It's kinda like when a state passes a law and then other states pick up the law.

282
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,560
And even if that state doesn't pass it, the law being written may be adopted by others.

283
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:13,480
I've just put out a basic template to everybody and god bless drudgereport.com last night

284
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,040
for linking to it and getting it up there.

285
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:20,520
Infowars is getting its record all time, 15 year traffic right now.

286
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,320
That Infowars 15 years but on there 17.

287
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:28,720
Record since 1997, record traffic right now and the site is up and down.

288
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,320
And I'm trying to hire more IT folks to help the guys I got, they're like Scotty in the

289
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,320
engine room.

290
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:37,480
And we're hiring consultants, you name it, but I mean, it's just sustained set of a million

291
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,200
visitors between the sites every day that we normally get.

292
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,360
It's like two, three million a day.

293
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:47,840
And so we're trying to keep it up, but my citizens petition.

294
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:51,520
Citizen files petition to impeach Obama.

295
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:58,680
Citizen files, in fact, let me give you the exact headline.

296
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,640
Here it was up on Drudge Report, it was up there since last night, it may have been taken

297
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,640
down.

298
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:07,320
My own headline is on there because my site had gone down.

299
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:13,440
The point is that it's up on infowars.com and it is right there.

300
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,080
Citizens file articles of impeachment against Obama.

301
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:22,080
We can actually put that up on screen for everybody and it goes through it all.

302
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:26,280
Right there, ladies and gentlemen, the government is massing armaments against us, illegally

303
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:30,400
spying on us, buying billions of bullets, launching drones in the air, training kids

304
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:35,440
to spy on their parents, turning the entire system on its head, going down a list of tyrannical

305
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,840
actions and just checking them off.

306
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:42,480
Training the police and military for gun confiscation, in official army manuals.

307
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,480
In fact, we need to add that as articles of impeachment.

308
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:51,480
Since 2010, Obama has directed the Secretary of Defense to add this training for domestic

309
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,480
operations.

310
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,280
Here he is shaking hands with the poor little kids, let's put it back up there.

311
00:16:55,280 --> 00:17:00,360
Those poor little victims, take the guns or you don't support these kids, totally disgusting.

312
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,880
We've got it all recorded.

313
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:05,680
We're gonna be playing clips of this throughout the broadcast, but citizens file articles

314
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,760
of impeachment against Obama.

315
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:15,400
It is up on infowars.com and again, if the site is down for you, you can simply type

316
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:21,840
in citizens file articles of impeachment against Obama and it's signed by Alex Jones.

317
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:26,240
Just like I can go in and swear out an affidavit that I saw my neighbor burying somebody in

318
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:34,480
their backyard, just like I can go swear out an affidavit that I saw my neighbor dumping

319
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,120
poison in the well.

320
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:39,780
Just like you can swear out an affidavit that yes, you saw this guy run out of the liquor

321
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,840
store with a bag of money in his hand.

322
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,560
Well, I've seen treason, I've studied the Bill of Rights and Constitution, and I've

323
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,840
gone and seen what the constitutional lawyers are saying and members of Congress.

324
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,320
This is all impeachable.

325
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,560
He's already done a bunch of impeachable stuff.

326
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,420
We're always like, if you do more, we're gonna start impeachment.

327
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:58,860
If you do more, and they tell people in Congress, you want your airplane to blow up?

328
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,640
You want your car to run off the road?

329
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,640
Because these are gangsters.

330
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,640
Well, you know what?

331
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,640
I'm here.

332
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,640
You know what?

333
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,640
They kill me.

334
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,640
That's the way it is.

335
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,640
I'm like my forebears.

336
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,640
I cannot be a slave.

337
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:13,480
I know tyrants when I see it and I am not gonna, let me tell you this.

338
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:17,120
You either leave the country and it's a global government, they're taking over everywhere.

339
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:22,060
The same corporate fraud, the same corporate fascism, using socialism to indenture us,

340
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,780
to enslave us, to domesticate us.

341
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:28,040
You either leave the country or you fight back.

342
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,120
Because let me tell you something, they are gonna drop the hammer.

343
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:33,360
Folks, they've signed us on to 1,500 trillion.

344
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,680
The Chinese government, communists that have, folks type in Bloomberg, I wanna show them

345
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:42,060
a photo of it, suicide nets at Apple factories.

346
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:45,660
The 20 story factories where they drug them and they do forced abortions.

347
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:50,120
So all they do, by the hundreds, we're jumping off to commit suicide.

348
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,720
So they put nets there.

349
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:57,460
One person jumps, everybody copycats and goes up to jump because they're there.

350
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:58,460
They're drugged.

351
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:00,260
They're made to work 18 hours a day.

352
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:05,720
They put help me notes in the packages inside Apple's Foxconn factories that Al Gore's on

353
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,720
the board.

354
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:12,580
He's the one that demands they have the worst pay in China, slave labor.

355
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:14,640
Suicide nets installed at the dorms, okay?

356
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:19,060
They live in 100 square foot cubicles just like Bloomberg wants to set up.

357
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,060
This is a plan.

358
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:24,220
The globalists made a deal with China in the 70s to have the lowest standard in the world

359
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:27,120
to leverage out the United States and to buy our debt.

360
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,740
The globalists are clients with the Chinese government against the American people, against

361
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:31,740
their own people.

362
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:36,440
And the Chinese government came out three weeks ago and said, we own your debt, take

363
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,440
the guns.

364
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,900
That's an order.

365
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,760
That is a UN order through the Chinese.

366
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,440
I mean, they said, you will take the guns, we own your debt.

367
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,960
And Obama is hell-bent to get them.

368
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,920
Of course, they sent mercenaries in there to do that.

369
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,280
It's the oldest trick in the book.

370
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,280
Same thing with Colorado, has all the signs.

371
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:55,320
You send in the shooters, have the mental patient saying, I don't know who I am drugged

372
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,760
up in the parking lot, or you shoot the drug head in the back of the head and your guys

373
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,360
get out.

374
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:05,360
Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive from natural disasters

375
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:09,940
like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on

376
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,800
by a disastrous economy?

377
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,520
Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything.

378
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:18,320
At e Foods Direct, we hear from customers every day that are fortunate enough to weather

379
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,240
a life storm by having a supply of food on hand.

380
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:25,800
After Hurricane Sandy, Danny from New York City wrote, almost all of the grocery stores

381
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:30,600
are closed, but I managed to get my e Foods just in time to be able to help my sister

382
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,600
and niece.

383
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,400
It is better to be prepared 10 years too early than one day too late.

384
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,640
I can warn you, but I can't feed you.

Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

418
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:34,640
Have you ever wondered why banks, stock workers, investment advisors won't talk about gold

419
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,640
IRAs?

420
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:39,640
They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value

421
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,360
of gold for your retirement.

422
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,840

444
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:28,320
I'm gonna try to settle down here and be as calm as I can about all of this, but you have

445
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,620
to understand something.

446
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:36,200
They have passed laws, what, five years ago where they can basically take private pension

447
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,200
funds.

448
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,480
They haven't started the full move to get them.

449
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,520
They've done some tests.

450
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,360
They're talking about taking federal pension funds.

451
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,160
You notice in Europe this is happening.

452
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:50,440
You notice that they got massive tax increases through, including on the poorest working

453
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:57,600
Americans, 14 different taxes in the last raft of legislation that they rammed through

454
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,720
in the fake financial cliff.

455
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,520
Now they're back saying, we're in debt again.

456
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:07,120
Bernanke, the real head of this country, the head of the private Federal Reserve said yesterday,

457
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:12,060
let's just get rid of a debt ceiling entirely.

458
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:13,960
They've decided to go Weimar Republic.

459
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:17,000
They've decided to go Zimbabwe.

460
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
And do you know what that means?

461
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,960
It means hyperinflation.

462
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:26,300
But stag hyperinflation because you're not gonna have jobs on top of things increasing

463
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,360
in price.

464
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:32,080
And you're going to go from 25 million to 50 million on food stamps.

465
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,280
We've now crossed that Rubicon to 100 million.

466
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,580
And crime is just going to explode.

467
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:40,980
But see, these big city mafia types, they know what they do.

468
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:44,720
They shut things off, get people dependent, ship in the drugs.

469
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,720
Government ships in most of the drugs.

470
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:51,160
That's on record congressional hearings, 1997, Solicitor General, the CIA, it's on record.

471
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,600
Everybody knows that.

472
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:57,560
They destabilize the society, the working people, the middle class gets scared to say,

473
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:02,880
take whatever rights you want, just keep me safe from the street thugs.

474
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,080
And they know exactly what they're doing.

475
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:13,480
The problem is, you've had gun ownership in all 50 states go off the chart in the last

476
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,320
20 years roughly.

477
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,880
Gun ownership has exploded, the gun culture has exploded.

478
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:23,560
And so you've seen a 49%, I did a report on this last week, I'm gonna do another one today

479
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,560
or tomorrow with the fbi.gov numbers.

480
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:31,920
Cuz you know, I kept showing violent crime down 21% in the last 15, 16 years, 11 points

481
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:36,320
of that in the last, what, since 2007, last six years roughly.

482
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:43,920
So it's accelerating the drop in overall violent crime, mugging, stabbings, beatings, shootings.

483
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:50,440
And then I was there watching Fox News, and they were at fbi.gov, and they showed crime

484
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:56,040
with guns down a whopping 49%.

485
00:26:56,040 --> 00:27:01,080
You go to fbi.gov, I know the media is listening, go look it up, Fox News had it on.

486
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:05,600
I got my iPad, typed it in, went and found it.

487
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:11,400
People were saying to me, Alex, it's higher crime rate drop than what you said.

488
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,560
Why are you putting out this info?

489
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:17,960
I was going off one statistic, 49.

490
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:23,080
They cannot stand that, folks, that you're in charge, that you've got a gun, that criminals

491
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,880
are scared, that every day there's a new 911 tape in the news.

492
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:31,720
But it's always just local, never national, where the woman's on 911 going, don't come

493
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,720
in.

494
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,720
Okay, he's busted down the front door.

495
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,720
I'm going in the bathroom.

496
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,500
911's like, yes, yes, don't engage him, go in the bathroom and hide.

497
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:42,000
He's busting down this door, his arm's coming through a hole, he opened it.

498
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,840
I'm gonna shoot him, boom, boom, boom, boom, dead.

499
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:49,560
Or the guy crawls out and dies on the street, or crawls out and is bleeding and the cops

500
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,680
come and get him.

501
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,800
That's what we're talking about.

502
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:59,320
You see it constantly because of sites like infowars.com and worldnetdaily.com and drudgereport.com

503
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:02,360
that break the establishment media blockade.

504
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:15,800
ABC, NBC, CBS, they will never, ever, ever, ever, ever show you that information, 49?

505
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,520
I didn't even know that.

506
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:22,400
I mean, I'd heard the numbers and seen them over the years, a 20 plus percent reduction

507
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:26,840
in violent crime within three years after a concealed carry went in in Florida, same

508
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:27,880
number in Texas.

509
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:33,840
But I guess it's been compounding now over the last decade or more, 49.

510
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,960
I was sitting there and I go, that can't be true, 49.

511
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:43,120
That's almost a 50% cut in crimes using guns.

512
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:49,720
And this criminal is up there on TV using kids, and let me tell you, I had him faded

513
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,720
down.

514
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,720
It's a good thing when it was live.

515
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:55,220
During the break, they were queuing it up back there, we're gonna get it ready for you.

516
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:58,480
Instant high def off the TV, we gotta break it down to play it here on the radio and streaming

517
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,480
on the web.

518
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:03,000
Point is, we can't just instantly convert that high def.

519
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,960
We should set up where we can instantly play high def out here once it's been taped, but

520
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:06,960
whatever.

521
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:13,480
The point is, you saw it, he high fived the kids with a big stinking smile, and Biden

522
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,720
could hardly stop smiling.

523
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,720
He was trying to have a serious look, and I wanna do a piece on that, alert to the real

524
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,720
media out there.

525
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:24,340
Biden, a bunch, was going, especially when he was first introducing Obama, he was trying

526
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:25,340
not to smile.

527
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:26,340
He was going.

528
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:29,340
Yeah, I'm gonna get that gun, baby.

529
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:39,440
Yeah, I'm a gangster, I mean, Biden is a gangster, he is a thug, and so is Obama.

530
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,280
They're a bunch of slick thugs.

531
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:46,880
Let me tell you something, your Chicago, New York gangster crap doesn't fly in Texas.

532
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,680
You got that, scum?

533
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:53,360
We're on the march, the empire's on the run.

534
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:57,160

543
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:39,440
leave the silver at the surface, but rather we have formulated our silver gel using the

544
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:44,000
natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the

545
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
skin while delivering the silver more effectively.

558
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:34,480
require electricity, purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.

00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,640

579
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,520
I was trained in firearms.

580
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,640
I carried a concealed weapon.

581
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:12,840
I made the determination that if somebody was going to try to take me out, I was going

582
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:16,760
to take them with me.

583
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:24,800
If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban,

584
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:31,800
picking up every one of them, Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in, I would have done

585
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,800
it.

586
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:37,560
Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.

587
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:43,920
That's Alex Jones.

588
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:54,600
I'm going to try to settle down here as best I can.

589
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,200
I want to open the phones up so you can respond to this.

590
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:02,960
David Knight's got the transcript, one of our reporters in there, of Obama and Biden's

591
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:03,960
speech.

592
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:09,720
There were 23 executive actions and executive orders.

593
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,280
They didn't give any particulars.

594
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,000
Well, here's the deal.

595
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:21,840
If you go watch the two hour long C-SPAN last week of Rahm Emanuel and others at that socialist

596
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,480
think tank.

597
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:26,600
We posted the whole video on Infowars.com a few days ago.

598
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,240
They lay out the whole plan.

599
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,600
He says we're just gonna let police take the guns.

600
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:34,480
We're gonna just target gun owners and claim they have the guns illegally.

601
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:38,480
We're gonna shut down the gun manufacturers, we're gonna lean on the gun sellers.

602
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,200
We're gonna use mafia tactics, that's what he's saying.

603
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:46,680
And again, they're gonna deputize the medical tyranny, the same people that are already

604
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:52,920
giving kids shots without parental consent, to basically call in endangerment orders when

605
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:55,440
they call your kid aside and ask him about guns.

606
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:59,880
They had to pass a law on the healthcare bill that conservatives put in there to where it

607
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,760
made it illegal for them to do that.

608
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,640
But Obama doesn't care.

609
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:07,020
He says I'm telling doctors you do this.

610
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:13,400
It was doctors that put that guy Lanza and Holmes on all those psychotropic drugs and

611
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:17,520
Harris and Kleibold and the list goes on and on.

612
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,760
And nothing was said about drugs in that speech.

613
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,760
I've got the transcript.

614
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:26,720
I didn't watch the whole thing cuz I was talking over it, but correct?

615
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:31,240
And I mean, let me have that transcript, I forgot and left it out there, thank you.

616
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,880
I mean, that is just amazing.

617
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:39,160
By the way, drudgereport.com, it has all the latest stuff on this, so does infowars.com.

618
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:44,320
The problem is infowars is up and down because of the incredible traffic.

619
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,080
Kurt thought it was a denial of service attack.

620
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:51,360
They looked at the traffic, no, it's all time record traffic, which I'm not happy about.

621
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:56,200
If we turn this country around, I would literally have a show about science and a show about

622
00:35:56,200 --> 00:36:00,400
literature and movies and about camping and stuff.

623
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:04,680
I would have a once a week, three hour radio, TV show, variety show.

624
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:07,600
I mean, I'd have like magicians on and stuff.

625
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:11,640
I would have a interesting, it'd be like a Johnny Carson show, okay?

626
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:19,880
I don't like having to do this, but I am completely possessed with resistance to tyranny.

627
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,640
I am completely animated.

628
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,000
I cannot control myself.

629
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:28,280
I can hardly sleep because I know we're dealing with criminal tyrants.

630
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:34,000
Drudgereport.com, there it is, citizens file articles of impeachment against Obama.

631
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:39,620
And then you go to infowars.com and it is right there.

632
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:44,520
And again, I wrote this, I wrote articles of impeachment a year ago that didn't get

633
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,520
any attention.

634
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,960
I wrote this with Paul Watson over the telephone last night because he can type better than

635
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,960
I can.

636
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:54,280
It would take me five hours if I typed it myself cuz I just make mistakes and go back

637
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,680
and use a spell checker.

638
00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:00,280
So we wrote this in about two hours together on the phone, but I think I probably need

639
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:03,040
to get Watson on the phone during a break.

640
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:08,800
And just add, so people understand, the original Declaration of Independence started as citizens'

641
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:15,400
petitions called Bill of Particulars in all of the 13 colonies circulated listing the

642
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:20,280
crimes that government was committing against the free rights of an Englishman that they'd

643
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:25,960
fought in 1215 to get and then again with the Parliament Act.

644
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:30,700
Most of the Parliament supported our secession until the King of England basically threatened

645
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,160
to arrest a bunch of them.

646
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:36,480
And King George III rode to Parliament and addressed Parliament that was unheard of and

647
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:42,560
said your duty as Englishman is to get in there and take down these rebels.

648
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:46,760
And they again threatened to arrest more people if they didn't get in line.

649
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:51,440
So the king bullied, they would have kept the colonies, we'd still be part of England

650
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:55,140
folks if they, but hey, I'm a British citizen.

651
00:37:55,140 --> 00:38:00,760
My ancestors fought for the right for me to have guns and swords and cannons.

652
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:06,220
And I need these to protect myself from the French and the Spanish and the Indians.

653
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:07,400
They were all fighting each other.

654
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,960
They were all teaming up together at different times.

655
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,200
I mean, it was amazing.

656
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,280
There were wars where you'd have 10,000 people get killed.

657
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:22,840
I mean, the westerns all advertise everything that happened from the 1860s on with the Comanche

658
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:25,540
and the Apaches, that was nothing.

659
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:34,120
There were wars with weird rebel settler groups like something out of Conan the Barbarian.

660
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:44,720
And 20,000 Indians with groups of whites and escaped slaves in Andrew Jackson's time and

661
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:48,840
before that would come pouring down out of the Illinois territory.

662
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:54,920
And just huge wars and whole towns and cities burned and tens of thousands dead.

663
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,560
No one even knows this history.

664
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:00,020
I mean, it was just Conan the Barbarian.

665
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:04,960
They never make movies out of any of that because that's not what they wanted to popularize

666
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,160
because the real history is so incredible.

667
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,400
My point is nobody was good in that.

668
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,540
Everybody was barbarous.

669
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:12,380
Everybody was making side deals.

670
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:16,200
This Indian tribe coming and saying, English, help me take out these guys with the French

671
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:20,200
and I'll help you divide and conquer the whole nine yards.

672
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:25,280
And the redcoats came and said, we're coming to confiscate your guns.

673
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:32,380
And another thing is the Englishman didn't like the militarized police and the checkpoints

674
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:36,420
and their wives being searched physically.

675
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:41,520
And so they would go and beat up redcoats and redcoats would come and shoot the brigands

676
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,580
as they call them.

677
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:44,240
And then the men would go ahead and shoot back.

678
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,560
And then the redcoats said, that's it, people are starting to shoot back.

679
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:50,220
We're coming to take your guns, line up and turn them in.

680
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:52,240
And about half the population turned their guns in.

681
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,320
But if they were Tories, pro-king, you can keep your gun.

682
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:58,960
In fact, you're now in the king's militia, go and kill whoever you want.

683
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:06,620
And it was the abuses and it was the outrages and it was the king's militias abusing and

684
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:12,920
raping and burning and stealing and shaking people down that turned the colonies against

685
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,440
the king and the redcoats.

686
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:18,440
This went on for 15 years roughly.

687
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:22,840
Imagine you're taking apples to town for sale and you come up and there is a government

688
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:29,880
auxiliary SWAT team aiming a cannon at you out of the back of the wagon and they got

689
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:32,160
guns and they say get out.

690
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:36,340
And they come and they steal your apples and they reach into your purse, your wallet and

691
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,340
take your money.

692
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:40,340
And you're like, I've got to have that to buy seeds for next year.

693
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:42,760
That's everything I've worked for for a year.

694
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:48,260
And they're just like, stand him up, break his jaw.

695
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:52,480
And if you complained about it, they take your wife and kids and they put them in stocks

696
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,480
till they died.

697
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,820
A torture apparatus with your head and arms in it.

698
00:40:55,820 --> 00:41:01,380
You know how Andrew Jackson, Andrew Jackson, you know how his mother and brother died?

699
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:03,160
In a concentration camp.

700
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:09,620
So he joined the rebellion when he was 11 years old and ran messages and he wouldn't

701
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:10,620
brag about it.

702
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:13,680
So the history is 100% nailed down, but also snipered British soldiers.

703
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:17,260
He's 11, 12, 13, 14 years old, okay?

704
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:19,840
That's where our country came from, ladies and gentlemen.

705
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,820
That's what our country was born out of.

706
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:27,620
People's mothers tied up in a concentration camp to die, okay?

707
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:30,540
And that's where every government ends up going.

708
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:35,940
In Russia, in Germany, in China, in Cuba, and in England has had these wars over and

709
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:38,340
over again.

710
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:43,060
The reason the British are so polite is that it goes back to the age of chivalry in the

711
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:45,200
15th, 16th, 17th century.

712
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:49,660
If you were rude to someone, and it all came out of the enlightenment and people becoming

713
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:54,780
free, it was I don't care who you are, you insult me, you be a lord, you be anybody.

714
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:57,720
You're gonna get in a fight with me, I'm gonna call you out.

715
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:01,840
And no one's gonna associate with you ever again if you don't pull your sword or walk

716
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:06,500
your 20 paces and we're gonna fight to the death right now, okay?

717
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:11,340
You just insulted me, you just acted like a tough gang banger, get out in the street,

718
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:16,180
somebody's gonna die right now.

719
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:23,780
An armed society is a polite society, and if you're watching me on TV today, if you're

720
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:32,220
watching the radio streams on TV right now, you notice I'm wearing my camouflage duck

721
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:33,220
hunting jacket.

722
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:39,060
And of course, in a real urban warfare situation, camouflage would be a sports jacket, suit

723
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:44,060
and tie, all right?

724
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:49,980
With a collapsible rifle in the small of my back.

725
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:56,620
I am not an offensive military person, even though I have the basic skills of a rifleman

726
00:42:56,620 --> 00:43:01,020
passed on since the founding of this country and before.

727
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:06,360
But the reason I'm wearing camouflage and the new t-shirt that we're selling that by

728
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:11,500
the way has blown away any shirt we've ever sold, it's an AK-47 says come and take it.

729
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:14,660
What my ancestor said at Gonzales, Texas, you come and take it.

730
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:18,660
You wanna take our guns, Santa Ana, you come and take them.

731
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:23,380
That was only 50 years or less after the Revolutionary War.

732
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:29,220
And it says inside the AK-47, the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.

733
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:35,780
Boom, that is the all time bestseller and you support our info war, it's a war bond.

734
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:39,420
It's got infoawars.com on the back, wear your colors proud, meet like minded patriots.

735
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:43,920
And let me tell you, the reason I'm so focused, the reason I'm so angry is also I am risking

736
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:50,500
my life, my treasure, my name to be out front and say, let's have the second American Revolution,

737
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:54,420
have the state secede, pull out, re-upload the republic, which is in the Declaration

738
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:55,420
of Independence.

739
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:59,300
It's not our right, it's our duty to absolve the government and then create a new one.

740
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:00,380
Well, we want our republic back.

741
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:05,580
So you're not real, you're global sympathizers, you're Vici French to the Nazis, get out.

742
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:07,300
We re-upload the republic.

743
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:11,640
And I've had top constitutional lawyers that advise Congress, advise Ron Paul, Harvard

744
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:14,280
lawyers on, they agree with my analysis, okay?

745
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:19,660
Cuz it's not my analysis, it's 1776, it's Declaration of Independence, it's July 4th,

746
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:20,740
it's everything.

747
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:32,300
But I gotta tell you, it's inbred, all these Texans that you see, like Stockton and Toth

748
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:37,780
and all the rest of them, I've gone and looked into these people.

749
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:43,900
They've all been five, six, seven, eight generation Texans, who were the very frontline of the

750
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:52,460
most radical, violent, but smart and aggressive, adventurous Americans in frontier expansion.

751
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:56,740
And some of the most vicious ongoing wars went on here, Indian wars, you name it.

752
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:59,980
And so it's not a macho thing that Texans are saying.

753
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:04,060
And notice it's Texans saying, hey, it isn't happening, it's that it's genetic.

754
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:08,340
I don't care if you're black, white, Hispanic, who you are.

755
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:13,900
If you're a Texan and your ancestors go back, you are hot blooded and you're ready because

756
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:17,260
your ancestors were willing to be in the violent frontier.

757
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:21,180
You know Pancho Villa, there was a long civil war in the north of Mexico.

758
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:25,700
The Mexican government tried to take their guns, and what was it, a ten year civil war?

759
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:29,700
Killed hundreds of thousands of people, it's estimated, it was incredible.

760
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:32,700
Because up in the north of Mexico was just as wild as Texas.

761
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:36,780
People are like, you're gonna take my gun when there's wolves and coyotes and bandits

762
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:37,780
and everybody?

763
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:38,840
You're not taking my gun?

764
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:42,280
And the central government said, we are gonna take your guns.

765
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:46,060
There was a civil war in Mexico, a couple of them.

766
00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:49,960
You know what, they didn't win, Mexico didn't win against Guatemala and they had guns.

767
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:51,440
That's why Guatemala is Guatemala.

768
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:54,980
The point is everybody wants their guns.

769
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:57,900
Because folks, it's bold that he's going after the guns.

770
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:01,320
When he wants the moral high ground, they're gonna stage something else.

771
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:06,940
White House readies 23 executive actions developing, press doctors to ask patients about guns at

772
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:11,220
home, healthcare providers to offer gun safety tips, counselors in schools.

773
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:14,620
It'll be a big gun demonization thing where kids say bang, bang with their fingers, have

774
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:15,660
a Nerf gun.

775
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:22,340
They shut down whole blocks and arrest the kid, I mean, at least 4.5 billion in new spending

776
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:26,780
to demonize and prosecute and harass gun owners and hold us up like we're child molesters,

777
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:29,060
which is what the Attorney General said they do.

778
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:34,300
Ignores violent movies, video games, pro-gun senator vows to push new gun laws.

779
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:37,300
See, there's all these disgusting defections.

780
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:41,780
White House releases letters from pleading children and then high fives them.

781
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:47,100
They couldn't help but smile.

782
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:50,420
Hospitals to stop delivering babies because of Obamacare.

783
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:52,460
Man, that's incredible.

784
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:53,460
Look at this.

785
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:55,340
NRA plans fight of the century.

786
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:57,860
Citizens file articles of impeachment against Obama.

787
00:46:57,860 --> 00:47:01,300
Again, that's top right hand side of drugsreport.com.

788
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:03,260
Easiest way to find it, get it.

789
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:06,800
And again, I'm gonna call Watson during a break.

790
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:13,140
And I'm going to basically add the point at the top so that laymen out there don't understand

791
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:17,180
that I've had constitutional lawyers on that agree with this premise.

792
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:21,760
You've got to first put out what's impeachable, and then we link to proof and lawyers and

793
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:25,180
news articles admitting it's impeachable.

794
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:28,620
I mean, him becoming the head of the UN Security Council, which they admitted on the news,

795
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:33,020
violated Article I, Section 9 of the Constitution, to serve a foreign power or to hold another

796
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:36,300
office at the same time of government.

797
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:37,300
Totally illegal.

798
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:39,700
I mean, it's a felony.

799
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:43,420
Article I, Section 9, boom, got you right there, boom, got you right there.

800
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:45,660
I mean, we got you over and over again.

801
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:52,780
It'd be like a cop driving by and seeing somebody cooking methamphetamine in their front yard

802
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:53,780
in a bathtub.

803
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:54,780
And you can smell it.

804
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:55,780
You walk up.

805
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:56,780
Is that methamphetamine?

806
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:57,780
Yeah, it's methamphetamine.

807
00:47:57,780 --> 00:47:58,780
Boom, you're going to jail.

808
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:02,660
I mean, it's an absolute red-handed.

809
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:06,820
It'd be like catching Jerry Sandusky in the showers raping a kid.

810
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:09,320
Of course, he didn't get in trouble cuz it was a giant pedophile command base.

811
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,500
But the point is, that's what it's like.

812
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:14,620
I mean, it is in the act.

813
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:20,540
It is caught in the act, caught in the bank with a gun saying, give me the money.

814
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:23,900
And an off-duty cop pulls a gun or a concealed carry person and says, hands up.

815
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:29,260
And you got security cameras, you got witnesses, you got everybody sought, forgotten country.

816
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:32,340
You were in there saying, give me the money or I'm gonna shoot you.

817
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:34,940
Boom, you're going to prison.

818
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:37,940
There's no doubting it, okay?

819
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:40,620
All we've got to do, see, this is what dictators did.

820
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:42,060
Hitler did it, others have done it.

821
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:44,360
Lenin didn't grab all the power right away.

822
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:46,960
They slowly get away with whatever they want.

823
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:51,340
They slowly do whatever they want.

824
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:55,020
And listen, even in East Germany, one of the greatest police states ever, they had all

825
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:58,260
these great rights and liberties in their constitution, just no one followed them.

826
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:04,340
And it took citizens not complying, saying no, criticizing the system, whisper campaigns,

827
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:09,260
supporting good police, going against bad police, until it finally just collapsed.

828
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:13,860
I'm gonna take a few phone calls in this segment and the next, then we're gonna get Pastor

829
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:15,820
Manning on with his take on this show.

830
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:18,540
He prayed for me when I was in New York and he prayed when we were getting stalked by

831
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:19,540
Bloomberg thugs.

832
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:23,940
And I wanna get his take on all this cuz he said, you watch, Obama's gonna try to become

833
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:24,940
a dictator.

834
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:25,940
And I was naive four years ago.

835
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:29,040
I knew he was bad, but I didn't think they'd move this quick.

836
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:35,340
And then we're gonna have Representative Steven Toth, or Toth as he pronounces it, on, who

837
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:40,620
I just saw on, and that is somebody who needs to be in Congress, he's state rep.

838
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:47,380
I just saw him on Wolf Blitzer when I was in the coffee room for about two minutes.

839
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:52,780
And I mean, he was well-spoken, had incredible demeanor, looked super sharp, that is what

840
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:53,780
we need.

841
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:57,580
And he explained, look, I don't care if you pass laws in Congress saying you can take

842
00:49:57,580 --> 00:49:59,660
the guns, it would take an amendment.

843
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:03,100
And even that would be unconstitutional cuz it only points out on the right that already

844
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:04,100
exist.

845
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:08,180
We're not gonna put up with this, and Texas is gonna nullify this.

846
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:10,620
And Wolf Blitzer's like, you can't do that.

847
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:16,300
Really, how come all these states then let the illegal aliens be not arrested?

848
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:21,260
He knows what he's talking about, and I haven't talked to him yet, but it sounds like he's

849
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:22,260
a listener.

850
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:23,900
So again, that's what I'm doing here.

851
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:26,700
Let me tell you the real power of this broadcast, by the grace of God.

852
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:30,940
For all my problems, I am a real person who loves liberty and is willing to die for it

853
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:32,580
if it takes that.

854
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:37,100
And I'm on the line here, and the info I'm putting out more and more is getting to other

855
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:38,100
people.

856
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:41,920
And that's exactly what's happening right now, thanks to DrudgeReport.com, Citizens

857
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:44,220
File Articles of Impeachment Against Obama.

858
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:48,880
And I need to write a first line in there that I'm gonna add just explaining.

859
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:52,100
This is how our original Declaration of Independence started.

860
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:57,340
They were Bill of Particulars passed around showing the use of patience in crimes.

861
00:50:57,340 --> 00:51:00,520
This can now be picked up by Congress or added to.

862
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:04,260
If you've ever wanted one of our best selling generators, but were waiting for an offer

863
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:09,220
so crazy you couldn't refuse, then you're not gonna wanna miss this exciting message.

864
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:10,220
Here's why.

865
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:15,540
Solar generators provide life-saving electrical power, and unlike gas generators, solar generators

866
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:19,940
run quietly, emit no fumes, and produce electricity from the sun.

867
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:23,380
So when the lights go out, you'll always have the power you need.

868
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:24,980
Now here's the best part.

869
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:29,660
Every year, we accumulate a few solar generators that we just can't sell as new.

870
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:34,840
We put them in a special spot in our warehouse, and we discount them heavily at the end of

871
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:35,840
each year.

872
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:39,580
We call them scratch and dent units, but they're really just like new.

873
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:44,780
Each unit comes with a full factory warranty and special bonuses you just won't believe.

874
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:45,780
Don't wait.

875
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:46,780
They go fast.

876
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:50,220
Go to scratchanddentsolar.com, that's scratchanddentsolar.com.

877
00:51:50,220 --> 00:52:00,480
For the craziest offer we've ever made, go to scratchanddentsolar.com, that's scratchanddentsolar.com.

878
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:01,860
Don't throw away leftovers.

879
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:06,460
Instead, throw all your leftovers, vegetable peels, eggshells, coffee grounds, pizza crusts,

880
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:08,000
and more into the Bokashi.

881
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,580
If you love to garden and compost but don't like the hassle of turning a compost bin or

882
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:16,060
the smell, then check out the EM Bokashi Food Waste Recycling System from Tereganics.

883
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:20,500
Finally, a way to recycle all your food and plant waste safely and effectively and stop

884
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:24,300
using fertilizers, the EM Bokashi Food Waste Recycling System.

885
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:28,480
Rather than decomposition, the Bokashi system uses fermentation to break down waste, so

886
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:32,740
it takes less time to create nutrient-dense humus for crops or gardens with no turning

887
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:34,420
and no obnoxious odors.

894
00:52:56,580 --> 00:52:59,840
Tereganics, life's getting better.

895
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:04,460
Weakened by GMOs, stressed out about money, and blasted by the electric environment.

896
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:08,980
Hi, I'm Pastor Jenny, and that was the state I was in back in 2010.

897
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:10,980
Then I learned about RNA drops.

898
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:16,660
I learned that 97% of my DNA that scientists have called junk is actually packed with millions

899
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:21,440
of gene switches that play a critical role in controlling how my cells, organs, and other

900
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:22,580
tissues behave.

901
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:26,580
I learned I don't have to put up with disease decay or decline like I'd been conditioned

902
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:27,580
to believe.

903
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:33,420
I began taking RNA drops, a 100% natural formula designed to turn on those switches and provide

904
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:35,580
me with amazing health and joy.

910
00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:23,100
Well, the globalists have really gambled.

911
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:30,100
It was mentioned 49 times and drugs were mentioned zero times, when the drugs are the main cause,

912
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:33,700
the main cause, guaranteed, on record.

913
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:37,060
And Representative Steve Stockman of Obama violates the Constitution, a lot of people

914
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:43,180
will call for his impeachment, NRA ad we're gonna be playing, Obama is elitist hypocrite,

915

toll-free number to join us, 800-259-9231 for you to respond to what the globalists

916
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:53,420
are doing.

917
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:59,260
I just wanna say this, I wanna thank God for my provision and protection, and I wanna thank

918
00:54:59,260 --> 00:55:04,900
all of you, the listeners, and I wanna thank our AM&FM affiliates, because I know reality

919
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:08,160
is a crazy thing, and I know it sounds wild even having me on the air, and I appreciate

920
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:11,380
all of our stations, we're getting a lot more by the grace of God.

921
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:17,660
I wanna thank the real media, not the state-run media, that have helped us over the years,

922
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:24,860
George Norrie really helped us get to a higher level, DrudgeReport.com just obviously resonates

923
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:30,860
with our analysis, and it's just turbo charging, it's not even the word what we're doing, probably

924
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:34,740
get me killed, this keeps going, but whatever, at least we're gonna beat the globalist.

925
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:38,800
Because I mean, can you imagine, it's like Alex Jones at Infowars.com, it's already a

926
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:42,900
force with a giant rocket strapped to its butt.

927
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:47,740
And so I'm like Wile E. Cody on top of the big rocket lighting the fuse, or Matt Drudge

928
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:49,580
is back there.

929
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:55,100
So I wanna thank you for loving liberty, and listen, when it's all said and done, I know

930
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:58,500
we don't do this because of ego, we do it because we don't wanna be slaves.

931
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:03,500
It's our instinct to get really upset about a bunch of lying crooks trying to disarm us.

932
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:06,820
But when it's all said and done, the people that have fought this tyranny, none of us

933
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:08,940
are perfect.

934
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:15,100
But the folks over at WorldNetDaily, people like Drudge and his crew, my crew, man, there's

935
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:16,100
so few.

936
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:19,140
I mean, I've gotta be honest, there's so few that really are hardcore, that really know

937
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:20,140
what's going on.

938
00:56:20,140 --> 00:56:25,900
He's not perfect in many ways, but he defends the Bill of Rights, Michael Savage, I mean,

939
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:26,900
there's just not many.

940
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:31,700
Glenn Beck does nasty stuff to me on the side, but he does a lot of good work.

941
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:32,700
So you know what?

942
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:36,380
As long as he doesn't say Ron Paul's supporters should be arrested again, like he said four

943
00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:39,780
years ago, I wanna bury the hatchet with Glenn Beck.

944
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:44,940
I say that a lot and then he comes out and says I'm a fascist, but you know what?

945
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:47,260
Fascists wear fancy suits, they don't wear camo.

946
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:49,040
The devil comes as an angel of light.

947
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:53,940
The devil comes acting all fair and friendly and beautiful, but can you smell the stench

948
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:54,940
of death?

949
00:56:54,940 --> 00:57:02,980
I mean, listen, this is so real, folks, we've got to circle the wagons if you want any future.

950
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:06,100
And the issue is we resonate with the public, the public.

951
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:09,360
But the public that's awake and has street smarts.

952
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:13,880
And when you look at the general public, I mean, they're putting out all these fake polls

953
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:17,420
saying only 15% wanna keep their guns, pure bull.

954
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:22,260
I've got scores of scientific polls where the vast majority are pro-gun.

955
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:26,580
The gun culture has been taking over, but people emotionally when they say if it stops

956
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:30,820
the death of little children, would you want more reasonable restrictions?

957
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:35,720
And they call telephone trees of people they know have answered questions before, that's

958
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:38,580
how Rasmussen and all these guys work.

959
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:41,940
And they call up the welfare lady and say, do you want less gun violence?

960
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:49,100
I sure do, take the guns, it doesn't matter if 99% said that I had to be fed to the sharks

961
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:52,980
for no reason, you can't do that in a republic, we're not a pure democracy.

962
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:57,220
The Greeks had a pure democracy for a while in some of their city states, they'd have

963
00:57:57,220 --> 00:58:02,040
a bucket of white rocks for a yes vote, black rocks for a no vote.

964
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:08,460
And the voters would go and put their rocks in there.

965
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:11,460
Only the upper gentry got to vote, but that was a democracy of the elite.

966
00:58:11,460 --> 00:58:15,740
And who doesn't like what Aesop just said?

967
00:58:15,740 --> 00:58:21,060
I don't like it, well, the rocks say, 90% of the rocks say, Aesop, we're gonna throw

968
00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:23,660
you off that cliff, we're gonna make you drink hemlock.

969
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:28,180
I mix them all together, most of the famous philosophers you hear about were killed.

970
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:32,020
You know what, we don't like what you say, you're gonna die.

971
00:58:32,020 --> 00:58:36,060
How's that sound, see, cuz the pen is mightier than the sword.

972
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:43,220
But when they come for the sword, you know they're dropping the hammer.

973
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:50,340
This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.

974
00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:53,420
Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.

975
00:58:53,420 --> 00:58:58,420
The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.

976
00:58:58,420 --> 00:59:04,460
The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce

977
00:59:04,460 --> 00:59:05,460
to the global takeover.

978
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:11,460
That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at infowarshop.com.

979
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:15,100
These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.

980
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:20,100
We've got the life straw, so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.

981
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:24,820
The Ktor hand crank generator to charge up key equipment during power outages or out

982
00:59:24,820 --> 00:59:25,820
in the field.

983
00:59:25,820 --> 00:59:28,900
Strategic Relocation, third edition by Joel Skousen.

984
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:31,340
When disaster strikes by Matthew Stein.

985
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:36,260
TheraSafe used by Homeland Security to protect yourself during any radiological event.

986
00:59:36,260 --> 00:59:39,120
Hand crank shortwave AM-FM radios.

987
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:43,580
Everything that we've researched and found to be the best is available at infowarshop.com,

988
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:46,260
and your purchase makes our Infowar possible.

989
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:47,420
We're getting prepared.

990
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:48,420
Are you?

991
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:49,420
Infowarshop.com.

992
00:59:49,420 --> 01:00:05,180
Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.

993
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:09,980
Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.

994
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:10,980
You want answers?

995
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:13,100
Well, so does he.

996
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:17,300
He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.

997
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:21,220
And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.

998
01:00:21,220 --> 01:00:27,620
All right, we're going to be taking your calls now, and when Pastor Manning and when the

999
01:00:27,620 --> 01:00:32,660
state rep comes on, who's been fighting the globalist.

1000
01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:40,660
Most of the resistance is right here out of Texas, Wyoming, a little bit out of Tennessee.

1001
01:00:40,660 --> 01:00:46,500
And it's all people who know that their ancestors fought to protect the Second Amendment.

1002
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:50,360
And there's resistance out of Kentucky, there's resistance out of Oregon.

1003
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:53,700
Let's go to some phone calls right now.

1004
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:57,380
Remember folks, if we beat these people, you're all gonna be remembered as the next generation

1005
01:00:57,380 --> 01:00:59,020
of founding fathers and mothers.

1006
01:00:59,020 --> 01:01:02,620
I mean, this is the same kind of battle against even more evil people.

1007
01:01:02,620 --> 01:01:06,780
I mean, and the King of England was a cupcake compared to what we got.

1008
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:09,460
Patriot poet in Michigan, you're on the air.

1009
01:01:09,460 --> 01:01:11,340
Yeah, Alex.

1010
01:01:11,340 --> 01:01:12,740
Go ahead, sir.

1011
01:01:12,740 --> 01:01:16,100
Hey, this is Google Bomb guy, man.

1012
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:17,100
You're from Michigan.

1013
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:18,100
Yes, sir.

1014
01:01:18,100 --> 01:01:19,380
You're the guy that came up with the idea for the Google Bomb.

1015
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:20,380
Yes, sir.

1016
01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:21,380
How you been?

1017
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:22,380
I had to take a break, Alex.

1018
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:24,260
Things got so crazy.

1019
01:01:24,260 --> 01:01:26,940
But I got back as a member.

1020
01:01:26,940 --> 01:01:27,940
I can't get on the site.

1021
01:01:27,940 --> 01:01:28,940
Prison Planet's just jammed up.

1022
01:01:28,940 --> 01:01:29,940
I had you on through Infowars.

1023
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:38,780
That's the only way I could get a feed was to listen, and I'm a member on prisonplanet.tv.

1024
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:40,780
Well, I'm sorry.

1025
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:44,700
You need to send a customer service email over there, and they'll try to get back to

1026
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:45,700
you on that.

1027
01:01:45,700 --> 01:01:49,260
We've changed the configuration of it, works a little bit better, but thank you for the

1028
01:01:49,260 --> 01:01:50,260
support.

1029
01:01:50,260 --> 01:01:51,260
Listen, we're going to run out of time real quick.

1030
01:01:51,260 --> 01:01:54,900
It's good to talk to you, like we're sitting around here at the gas station on the bench,

1031
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:58,220
but do you got any comments about what's just been announced that happened?

1032
01:01:58,220 --> 01:02:03,020
Yeah, what I wanted to share with you is how far they've reached in, not just only with

1033
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:07,540
the Second Amendment, but a total takeover.

1034
01:02:07,540 --> 01:02:09,860
I want to show you how far this tyranny has reached in.

1035
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:11,420
This happened this morning, Alex.

1036
01:02:11,420 --> 01:02:13,100
I got to share this with you.

1037
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:21,340
The big conglomerate in Michigan for energy is DTE, which was Detroit Edison, right?

1038
01:02:21,340 --> 01:02:27,380
Well, they've got this program running where they'll come in your home, and they'll change

1039
01:02:27,380 --> 01:02:32,100
all your light bulbs out to those energy star compact fluorescent light bulbs.

1040
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:33,100
No, no, no, no.

1041
01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:36,900
And then later, they come by law, and you get fined if you don't have those light bulbs,

1042
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:38,140
and then it's forced from inspections.

1043
01:02:38,140 --> 01:02:40,020
They're just getting you used to it.

1044
01:02:40,020 --> 01:02:41,020
Right.

1045
01:02:41,020 --> 01:02:46,180
And they tried to walk, listen to this, with the maintenance man, they came trying to enter

1046
01:02:46,180 --> 01:02:53,740
my girlfriend's apartment without her permission, they were with the maintenance guy with the

1047
01:02:53,740 --> 01:02:57,780
keys to their apartment without even calling her, and they tried to just literally walk

1048
01:02:57,780 --> 01:02:58,780
to her-

1049
01:02:58,780 --> 01:03:01,800
No, no, listen, we're about five years behind Australia and England.

1050
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:05,740
They always start this stuff as voluntary, then it becomes mandatory.

1051
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:06,740
I appreciate your call, brother.

1052
01:03:06,740 --> 01:03:07,740
Good to hear from you.

1053
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:11,180
Send an email to customerservice at prisonplanet.tv.

1054
01:03:11,180 --> 01:03:14,460
Okay, let's go to Shannon in Ohio.

1055
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:15,460
You're on the air.

1056
01:03:15,460 --> 01:03:16,460
Yeah, I'm here.

1057
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:17,460
Go ahead, sir.

1058
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:22,700
Yeah, I've been listening to you for about five years now, Alex, and I woke a lot of

1059
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:23,700
guys up.

1060
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:24,700
I wasn't being a freak.

1061
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:29,300
I come at them slow just to open them up a little bit, and I bet with just me reaching

1062
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:32,700
out, I probably touched like 2,000 people.

1063
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:35,300
I've got some guys that are ready.

1064
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:36,300
We're all sitting back waiting.

1065
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:37,300
We're all fathers.

1066
01:03:37,300 --> 01:03:40,100
We take care of our kids, and we're ready.

1067
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:42,660
We know that we all got to stand up.

1068
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:46,580
I've been a boxer my whole life, I've fought professional fighters.

1069
01:03:46,580 --> 01:03:49,460
All I can tell these guys is don't be scared.

1070
01:03:49,460 --> 01:03:55,100
Once you break the ice and stuff hits the fan, just be ready, and trust me, the spirit

1071
01:03:55,100 --> 01:04:01,140
of our founding fathers will be with you and give you the strength to see you through,

1072
01:04:01,140 --> 01:04:02,140
okay?

1073
01:04:02,140 --> 01:04:04,920
Well, that is the good part about a fight, not that I'm a professional fighter, but it's

1074
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:06,260
like that in anything.

1075
01:04:06,260 --> 01:04:10,140
You're concerned until it starts, but boy, once it starts, it's like a duck to water,

1076
01:04:10,140 --> 01:04:11,140
isn't it?

1077
01:04:11,140 --> 01:04:12,140
Yes, it does.

1078
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:17,580
It's just your body takes over, and you're capable of doing so much that you just got

1079
01:04:17,580 --> 01:04:18,580
to break the ice.

1080
01:04:18,580 --> 01:04:19,580
Don't be scared.

1081
01:04:19,580 --> 01:04:23,140
Don't be scared, anybody, because I tell you what right now, I'd rather stand and fight

1082
01:04:23,140 --> 01:04:27,140
than get down on my knees like a coward and let them do what they want to do.

1083
01:04:27,140 --> 01:04:28,140
Well, here's the deal.

1084
01:04:28,140 --> 01:04:31,220
They're not well-meaning, reasonable guys that want to take guns for little kids.

1085
01:04:31,220 --> 01:04:33,940
They have those little kids up there to make them look like good guys.

1086
01:04:33,940 --> 01:04:38,460
These are mafia scum that have sworn to get all our guns to make us slaves.

1087
01:04:38,460 --> 01:04:40,560
And listen, I know you're ready to physically fight.

1088
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:44,700
Put that energy like you already said you did, my brother, into info war.

1089
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:48,380
Redouble, redouble, redouble again, waking people up.

1090
01:04:48,380 --> 01:04:49,980
You are the Paul Revere.

1091
01:04:49,980 --> 01:04:51,940
You are the resistance.

1092
01:04:51,940 --> 01:04:52,940
God bless you.

1093
01:04:52,940 --> 01:04:54,660
Shannon, good to hear from you.

1094
01:04:54,660 --> 01:05:00,760
George, Andy, Bill, Chris, your calls are all coming up, and Pastor Manning as well.

1095
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:04,740
Tons of people are going to get sick this winter from colds, flu, and other illnesses.

1096
01:05:04,740 --> 01:05:05,820
Don't be one of them.

1097
01:05:05,820 --> 01:05:10,940
Protect yourself with Supernatural Silver, a revolutionary new broad spectrum antibacterial

1098
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:11,940
solution.

1099
01:05:11,940 --> 01:05:15,620
Recent advances in silver technology have resulted in a silver solution that can be

1100
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:20,740
used daily to prevent bacteria, viruses, mold, and food poisoning, and help improve wound

1101
01:05:20,740 --> 01:05:21,740
healing.

1102
01:05:21,740 --> 01:05:25,840
Supernatural Silver is safe enough to consume every day, while powerful enough to destroy

1103
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:30,940
the causes of many serious diseases such as strep, staph, pneumonia, colds, flus, and

1104
01:05:30,940 --> 01:05:32,500
other harmful pathogens.

1105
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:37,380
This new technology has the ability to terminate entire colonies of harmful bacteria at several

1106
01:05:37,380 --> 01:05:41,520
hundred times the effectiveness of colloidal or ionic silver solutions.

1107
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:45,180
The Science Digest Journal says silver is our mightiest germ fighter.

1108
01:05:45,180 --> 01:05:49,040
It is virtually non-toxic and is emerging as a wonder of modern medicine.

1112
01:06:59,980 --> 01:07:04,820
Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves how did we ever survive from natural disasters

1113
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:09,420
like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on

1114
01:07:09,420 --> 01:07:11,280
by a disastrous economy.

1115
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:13,980
Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything.

At e Foods Direct, we hear from customers every day that are fortunate enough to weather

1117
01:07:17,780 --> 01:07:20,700
life's storm by having a supply of food on hand.

1118
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:25,260
After Hurricane Sandy, Danny from New York City wrote, almost all of the grocery stores

1119
01:07:25,260 --> 01:07:30,060
are closed, but I managed to get my e Foods just in time to be able to help my sister

1120
01:07:30,060 --> 01:07:31,060
and niece.

1121
01:07:31,060 --> 01:07:34,860
It is better to be prepared 10 years too early than one day too late.

1122
01:07:34,860 --> 01:07:37,100
I can warn you, but I can't feed you.

1123
01:07:37,100 --> 01:07:39,460

In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence,

1129
01:08:13,100 --> 01:08:17,940
whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial complex.

1130
01:08:17,940 --> 01:08:22,900
In Dallas, Texas, three shots were fired at President Kennedy's motorcade in downtown

1131
01:08:22,900 --> 01:08:23,900
Dallas.

1132
01:08:23,900 --> 01:08:29,900
The first reports say that President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by this shooting.

1133
01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:33,900
It is a big idea, a new world order.

1134
01:08:33,900 --> 01:08:40,100
It was almost as if there were planned implosions.

1135
01:08:40,100 --> 01:08:42,100
It just pancakes.

1136
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:49,100
Either you were with us or you were with the terrorists.

1137
01:08:49,100 --> 01:09:05,100
But I also believe that a lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in the hands

1138
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:11,100
of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals.

1139
01:09:11,100 --> 01:09:12,100
The guns will be taken.

1140
01:09:12,100 --> 01:09:13,100
No one will ever be armed.

1141
01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:14,100
We're going to take all guns.

1142
01:09:14,100 --> 01:09:15,100
For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American

1143
01:09:15,100 --> 01:09:16,100
city.

1144
01:09:16,100 --> 01:09:17,100
Is global governance at last?

1145
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:18,100
Is it one world the central bank is in charge?

1146
01:09:18,100 --> 01:09:19,100
But aren't we all just living and dying for what the central banks do?

1147
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:20,100
And for me, give me liberty or give me death!

1148
01:09:20,100 --> 01:09:41,580
Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.

1149
01:09:41,580 --> 01:09:43,140
I am committed.

1150
01:09:43,140 --> 01:09:44,800
Give me liberty or give me death.

1151
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:49,520
And now we've got police chiefs, sheriffs all across the United States from Texas to

1152
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:57,500
Washington State to Kentucky, sending letters to Obama saying, I am declaring a declaration

1153
01:09:57,500 --> 01:09:59,900
of independence against your tyranny.

1154
01:09:59,900 --> 01:10:03,380
I will not follow unlawful orders.

1155
01:10:03,380 --> 01:10:08,060
And we need more towns, more cities, more county judges like Judge Head in Lubbock,

1156
01:10:08,060 --> 01:10:12,300
who were getting on the show, talked to his office yesterday, to stand up and say, we're

1157
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:14,380
not going to comply with this.

1158
01:10:14,380 --> 01:10:17,220
And when Wolf Blitzer and people say, well, you've got to comply with whatever the federal

1159
01:10:17,220 --> 01:10:20,660
government says, why, Obama's the second coming of Abraham Lincoln.

1160
01:10:20,660 --> 01:10:23,020
Notice they've been saying that for five years.

1161
01:10:23,020 --> 01:10:26,180
And I said, because they're getting ready for insurrection in the states.

1162
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:28,860
And now they're saying, yeah, he's gonna be Lincoln.

1163
01:10:28,860 --> 01:10:31,260
He's gonna do whatever he wants.

1164
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:33,940
They want to cause a physical civil war.

1165
01:10:33,940 --> 01:10:34,940
I got an idea.

1166
01:10:34,940 --> 01:10:37,220
How about we have an info civil war?

1167
01:10:37,220 --> 01:10:40,260
Okay, how about we stand up and say no?

1168
01:10:40,260 --> 01:10:44,480
Just like what Pastor Manning did last year, where he had a public trial that got a lot

1169
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:48,460
of the news, laying out Obama and his criminal activities.

1170
01:10:48,460 --> 01:10:51,020
People go, well, what's the point of his citizens trial?

1171
01:10:51,020 --> 01:10:55,500
You put publicly out there what the person's done.

1172
01:10:55,500 --> 01:11:00,320
Many times people write a book exposing some criminal thing someone's done, and years later

1173
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:02,980
they get brought to justice.

1174
01:11:02,980 --> 01:11:05,880
We've had police officers and others on that are trying to bring Bill Ayers and others

1175
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:07,760
to justice for bombings.

1176
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:11,900
They have evidence they were connected to but didn't stay in prison for.

1177
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:16,680
And they've got witnesses, and it's the same thing.

1178
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:23,660
You've got to keep going after them, and that's why I put out a citizen's filing of articles

1179
01:11:23,660 --> 01:11:24,800
of impeachment.

1180
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:30,560
Because it lists from deep research from constitutional lawyers, all of the different things he's

1181
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:35,140
done that are impeachable on their face and beyond that.

1182
01:11:35,140 --> 01:11:42,440
There's a new hostage crisis, Al Qaeda Link Group says seven Americans among 41 hostages

1183
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:44,860
seized in Algeria attacked.

1184
01:11:44,860 --> 01:11:50,120
Our government is giving unlimited weapons in Libya and Syria to Al Qaeda jihadis who

1185
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:52,540
were then running all over Africa attacking people.

1186
01:11:52,540 --> 01:11:56,380
I mean, that's one of the articles of impeachment, it's admitted.

1187
01:11:56,380 --> 01:11:59,160
Our government is giving heat-seeking missiles to these people.

1188
01:11:59,160 --> 01:12:02,180
They're putting the Muslim Brotherhood in all these countries.

1189
01:12:02,180 --> 01:12:05,460
And then saying the TSA needs to go down my pants because of them.

1190
01:12:05,460 --> 01:12:10,880
Look at DrudgeReport.com, citizens file articles of impeachment against Obama.

1191
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:16,240
Second congressmen suggest impeachment, see, one said impeachment yesterday if he tries

1192
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:18,520
executive orders.

1193
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:22,840
And see, notice Obama made all these announcements, but he won't say what the particulars are.

1194
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:24,000
Well, guess what?

1195
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:27,400
We've written the articles from the different Democratic Party meetings they've had with

1196
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:31,000
Emanuel and Attorney General Holder, and they've said what it's gonna be.

1197
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:34,840
Okay, so he's gonna do executive orders on ammo, on importation.

1198
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:38,040
I'm gonna go over that after Pastor Manning leaves us cuz I don't wanna hog the time we've

1199
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:39,600
got with him.

1200
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:42,480
But citizens file articles of impeachment against Obama.

1201
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:46,040
I put out the fact that I'm a citizen, Alex Jones, signed by me.

1202
01:12:46,040 --> 01:12:51,720
I'm putting out in the court of public opinion in the decade leading up to 1775, 1776.

1203
01:12:51,720 --> 01:12:56,680
That's what the colonies did is they circulated petitions to government saying you better

1204
01:12:56,680 --> 01:12:57,840
stop, you better stop.

1205
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:00,120
So I'm putting out what you've done.

1206
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:05,040
I have a media platform like a newspaper and I'm saying you're committing crimes, I want

1207
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:06,040
you impeached.

1208
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:11,960
My name's John Hancock, my name's Alex Jones, and I don't wanna be a founding father in

1209
01:13:11,960 --> 01:13:12,960
Rebirth of the Republic.

1210
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:18,000
I'm just doing my job, but believe me, all of you fighting these tyrants are the John

1211
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:22,040
Handcocks, are the Patrick Henrys, are the Sam Adams.

1212
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:25,840
All of us that are in the media are like Sam Adams.

1213
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:28,880
The folks at The Drudge Report are like Sam Adams, people at World Net Daily are like

1214
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:29,920
Sam Adams.

1215
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:32,660
You're like Sam Adams, you're like Sam Adams.

1216
01:13:32,660 --> 01:13:35,340
We've gotta hit them with the info war, the truth.

1217
01:13:35,340 --> 01:13:40,080
Now I give you James David Manning, a chief pastor at the Atla World Missionary Church,

1218
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:44,180
reaches millions of people every month online in a big church there in town and has a huge

1219
01:13:44,180 --> 01:13:45,280
soup kitchen program.

1220
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:48,640
It's non-government run for the citizens of the area.

1221
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:53,320
And of course, they attacked the welfare state, that's why the establishment hates them, on

1222
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:59,720
the 123rd Street in New York City and has been an atlas since 1981.

1223
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:03,120
And he's a very well-spoken gentleman and very knowledgeable.

1224
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:06,840
I didn't think Obama was as bad as he was saying five years ago when I had him on and

1225
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:10,080
then three years ago, but it's certainly starting to get really scary.

1226
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:14,920
And he prayed for me, and I appreciate that, when we were in New York.

1227
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:19,480
And he prayed because what he laid out is exactly true, and I wanted to repeat that.

1228
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:22,520
Because I had that same feeling before I saw his video, I had this thought.

1229
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:27,940
God laid it into my mind, my spirit, hey buddy, you're anti-gun.

1230
01:14:27,940 --> 01:14:29,960
You're fighting the anti-gun guys.

1231
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:37,340
They will use a anti-gunner to kill you crazy to then say, see, even this pro-gunner got

1232
01:14:37,340 --> 01:14:39,260
killed by somebody with a gun.

1233
01:14:39,260 --> 01:14:43,700
And he said God laid that upon his heart, so I wanted to get him on to talk about this

1234
01:14:43,700 --> 01:14:45,840
and give his basic take on what's happening.

1235
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:47,680
Pastor, thanks for popping in with us today.

1236
01:14:47,680 --> 01:14:50,280
Thanks, Alex, thanks for having me today.

1237
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:51,600
Glad to be on your broadcast.

1238
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:53,080
Well, I've been ranting and raving.

1239
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:55,960
You've just seen the speech, high-fiving, using kids.

1240
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:58,080
What is your take on what's happening?

1241
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:00,360
Well, several things have happened.

1242
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:07,040
Let me just point out the fact that I am convinced that the CNN conference panel, the interview

1243
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:12,360
that they had after you were being on there with Piers Morgan, was a direct attempt to

1244
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:16,760
suggest to some crazy loon out there to take you out.

1245
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:18,840
I'm confident of that.

1246
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:20,080
And that's the reason why I prayed.

1247
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:23,920
I think all Americans need to understand what they're trying to do.

1248
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:25,060
They want to silence you.

1249
01:15:25,060 --> 01:15:31,040
You have become the voice for patriots and Americans, for gun owners and Americans, for

1250
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:32,240
the Second Amendment.

1251
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:34,360
You are indeed the spokesman for that.

1252
01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:39,080
I'm surprised that the NRA has not called you over and enlisted you to help them to

1253
01:15:39,080 --> 01:15:41,700
protect Americans and their rights to own guns.

1254
01:15:41,700 --> 01:15:45,000
You are the spokesman for a well-armed militia.

1255
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,440
And Obama doesn't want that.

1256
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:51,440
We need to be aware of the fact that Obama is the type of person, and the people we're

1257
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:55,920
dealing with at present, they are the type of people that will take you out.

1258
01:15:55,920 --> 01:16:00,460
They have no problems seeing you put in a grave and sending someone to take you out,

1259
01:16:00,460 --> 01:16:06,520
or even sending someone perhaps from the military or some other organization to take you out.

1260
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:08,400
So that's the reason why I prayed, Alex.

1261
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:12,360
Now, you asked me another question a few moments ago about what's happening with Obama using

1262
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:16,920
children as a shield, like Saddam Hussein did in his conference today.

1263
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:18,920
Is that what you're asking me about?

1264
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:19,920
Yes, sir.

1265
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:20,920
Yeah.

1266
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:23,200
That's what he did.

1267
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:29,720
I think that he is tear-jerking the American people, tugging at their heartstrings by putting

1268
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:32,680
those children up there and using them as pawns.

1269
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:38,600
It looked like a chess game with Obama being the king and Joe Breakdancer Biden being the

1270
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:43,720
queen and those little children being the pawns around him, pushing forward his executive

1271
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:46,880
orders on gun control, taking our weapons.

1272
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:50,440
That's what that was all about today.

1273
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:52,800
How did you know Obama was gonna be so bad?

1274
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:58,640
Because I mean, I didn't support him, but I didn't imagine he was this evil four years

1275
01:16:58,640 --> 01:16:59,640
ago.

1276
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:04,240
You know, one of the things, Alex, I tell people all the time that I am a spiritual

1277
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:08,760
individual and a lot of people have problems with that, some people are able to understand

1278
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:09,760
it.

1279
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:16,240
But I saw spiritually, Alex, in this band, the depths of the evil that he represents

1280
01:17:16,240 --> 01:17:18,200
and that's what he would do to this nation.

1281
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:24,600
And I began to scream as loud as I could when I first saw him appear on the scene and then

1282
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:31,000
as he moved closer to winning the office of presidency, although illegally, and the hysteria

1283
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:32,000
around him.

1284
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:36,320
I saw that this is an evil man and, Alex, it ain't over with yet.

1285
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:38,320
It ain't hardly over with yet.

1286
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:42,240
We have a lot more evil coming from this man that we have to endure.

1287
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:47,480
But I can say this, I'm confident that we will prevail, that he will not win.

1288
01:17:47,480 --> 01:17:53,280
We will get the victory in this process, but it will not be easily won.

1289
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:59,160
And it will not be for the faint of heart to persevere against what Obama is trying

1290
01:17:59,160 --> 01:18:00,560
to do to us as a people.

1291
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:05,120
Did you notice that Biden could hardly stop smiling?

1292
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:10,760
He was fighting, smiling, and Obama was trying to act sad, but he acted like that, you know,

1293
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:12,840
he was at the Kentucky Derby in front row seats.

1294
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:15,160
I mean, he acted like a pig and you know what?

1295
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:21,240
Well, I think that Biden finally feels that he's given some recognition, something that

1296
01:18:21,240 --> 01:18:22,560
will give him a legacy.

1297
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:26,800
I'm not sure exactly what Biden was up about today.

1298
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:28,400
Obama was very coy today.

1299
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:34,360
He was not his usual, I bully himself, and he wasn't quite as arrogant today as he normally

1300
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:35,360
is as well.

1301
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:38,440
I'll have to look at that again and really read what went on there.

1302
01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:44,600
Well, I saw the cover he was acting coy, but in the eyes, he looked evil.

1303
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:47,360
I mean, in fact, we're hearing more of this from his people.

1304
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:48,960
You saw the nice Obama.

1305
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:50,520
Now you're going to see the real Obama.

1306
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:51,840
Well, that's the thing.

1307
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:57,180
I think this this so-called second term that he is employing, that we're going to see the

1308
01:18:57,180 --> 01:18:58,180
real Obama.

1309
01:18:58,180 --> 01:19:01,920
We're going to see really what he's made of and the evil.

1310
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:05,120
I don't think he's going to make any attempts to hide anything.

1311
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:11,360
I'm not surprised that he's not probably promoting Muslim Brotherhood and Islamic ideas more.

1312
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:12,920
We're going to see who he really is in this.

1313
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:17,160
I saw this four years ago.

1314
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:18,160
It's amazing.

1315
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:22,980
We're going to go to break, but I want to ask your take on ways to oppose him and to

1316
01:19:22,980 --> 01:19:23,980
push for impeachment.

1317
01:19:23,980 --> 01:19:28,960
I mean, don't we need to list all the impeachable crimes he's committed and really press Congress

1318
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:31,400
to start the impeachment trial?

1319
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:39,320
Well, you know, I had a CIA Columbia Obama Sedition and Treason trial regarding his forged

1320
01:19:39,320 --> 01:19:42,520
certificate of graduation from Columbia.

1321
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:50,000
I explored in depth, Alex, his participation with the CIA, with the Mujahideens in Afghanistan

1322
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:54,240
when the Soviet Union invaded them back in nineteen seventy nine, I think it was.

1323
01:19:54,240 --> 01:19:58,320
I went through that step by step and I discovered that Obama...

1324
01:19:58,320 --> 01:19:59,320
Stay there.

1325
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:00,320
I want to talk about this.

1326
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:01,320
You got a federal visit.

1327
01:20:01,320 --> 01:20:05,760
Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive from natural disasters

1328
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:10,360
like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on

1329
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:12,200
by a disastrous economy?

1330
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:14,920
Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything.

1331
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:18,720
At E Foods Direct, we hear from customers every day that are fortunate enough to weather

1332
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:21,640
life's storm by having a supply of food on hand.

1333
01:20:21,640 --> 01:20:26,200
After Hurricane Sandy, Danny from New York City wrote, Almost all the grocery stores

1334
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:31,000
are closed, but I managed to get my E Foods just in time to be able to help my sister

1335
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,000
and niece.

1336
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:35,800
It is better to be prepared 10 years too early than one day too late.

1337
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:38,040
I can warn you, but I can't feed you.

1338
01:20:38,040 --> 01:20:40,400

1343
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:05,680
We travel so much and having a fake TV, well, it gives added peace of mind.

1344
01:21:05,680 --> 01:21:11,960
Burglars look for houses that appear to be easy targets, but fake TV can fool even professional

1345
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:15,560
burglars into thinking someone is home watching television.

1346
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:20,600
As a recent widow living alone, it gives me great peace of mind to set my fake TV near

1347
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:25,120
a window and know that passing motorists and pedestrians will think someone is home watching

1348
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:28,120
TV when I'm actually away from home.

1349
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:32,760
Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet just like a light on a timer.

1350
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:34,480
And they're so easy to use.

1351
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:36,520
You just plug them in and they're ready to go.

1352
01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:40,680
Plus, they're so affordable that we have one upstairs and downstairs.

1353
01:21:40,680 --> 01:21:43,760
Fake TV is only $34.95.

1356

Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

1364
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:34,720
Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold

1365
01:22:34,720 --> 01:22:35,720
IRAs?

1366
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:39,800
They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value

1367
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:41,480
of gold for your retirement.

1368
01:22:41,480 --> 01:22:44,960
Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

1369
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:49,960
If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.

1372
01:22:57,960 --> 01:23:03,600
Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the bestselling book, Cancer Step Outside the

1373
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:04,600
Box.

1374
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:07,520
I want you to know some very important information.

1375
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:12,320
In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White

1376
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:16,640
House at a time when only the President could obtain its world-class healer.

1377
01:23:16,640 --> 01:23:22,200
Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.

1378
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:27,280
Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally

1379
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:32,420
occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single

1380
01:23:32,420 --> 01:23:33,560
normal cell.

1381
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:37,320
If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune

1382
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:41,320
cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.

1383
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:49,240
Call 1-866-VENUSFLY or order from Carnivora.com, that's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A dot com.

1384
01:23:49,240 --> 01:23:56,600
That's 1-866-836-8735, 1-866-VENUSFLY or visit Carnivora.com.

1385
01:23:56,600 --> 01:23:57,600
That's your immune system.

1386
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:00,120
It's the only one you've got.

1387
01:24:00,120 --> 01:24:18,840
Pastor Manning is our guest for one more segment.

1388
01:24:18,840 --> 01:24:21,360
I want to get him back in the next few weeks for a full hour.

1389
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:25,560
ATLA.org is his website, A-T-L-A-H.

1390
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:31,680
In the next segment, we are now analyzing the vague statements of Obama, but they track

1391
01:24:31,680 --> 01:24:36,040
and follow exactly what we thought in the proposal.

1392
01:24:36,040 --> 01:24:39,680
I have this from the Washington Times, where they're just gonna take guns whenever they

1393
01:24:39,680 --> 01:24:43,400
find them in your car, even if they're legal, and you have no warrants.

1394
01:24:43,400 --> 01:24:48,680
And then they're going to decide if you get them back, and it's a no-fly, no-buy list.

1395
01:24:48,680 --> 01:24:52,220
They're just gonna put you on a no-gun list.

1396
01:24:52,220 --> 01:24:57,760
And it's official, DHS to expand and formalize coordination on gun control efforts.

1397
01:24:57,760 --> 01:25:03,560
Homeland Security is the takeover arm, and it will now be used to go after gun owners.

1398
01:25:03,560 --> 01:25:09,440
Okay, Pastor Manning, you got cut off by the break, and you were getting into the public

1399
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:12,540
trial you put on to demonstrate all this.

1400
01:25:12,540 --> 01:25:17,080
It's the same thing with a move towards impeachment, getting behind congressmen that are talking

1401
01:25:17,080 --> 01:25:20,920
about it, getting the points out about why we should impeach.

1402
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:22,640
We've got to get on the offensive.

1403
01:25:22,640 --> 01:25:28,000
What is your take on ways to turn the tide, because these guys are coming for us?

1404
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:31,800
Well, the impeachment idea is a good idea.

1405
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:36,640
Whether or not we can succeed with that is the question, because the Senate has to approve

1406
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:37,840
of it.

1407
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:41,880
And the Senate is right now controlled by the Democrats, Harry Reid, and so I'm not

1408
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:46,200
sure you're gonna be able to actually put an impeachment through on Obama.

1409
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:51,860
But it will be at least something to keep the nation aware of the fact that this man

1410
01:25:51,860 --> 01:25:57,760
is indeed evil, and probably force him to make a move, or force the American people

1411
01:25:57,760 --> 01:26:03,200
to just outright reject him, no confidence in him, whether the impeachment goes forward

1412
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:04,200
or not.

1413
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:05,920
So I think the action is a good action.

1414
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:09,620
Absolutely, well, nobody thought the Senate was gonna go after Nixon, but then they got

1415
01:26:09,620 --> 01:26:10,620
the votes.

1416
01:26:10,620 --> 01:26:14,360
It never even had to go to the Senate, because they had the hearings in the House.

1417
01:26:14,360 --> 01:26:16,640
We need real fast and furious hearings.

1418
01:26:16,640 --> 01:26:19,260
We need real hearings on the psychotropic drugs.

1419
01:26:19,260 --> 01:26:24,480
We need real hearings on all of his insider trading and the Democrats' insider trading.

1420
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:26,720
We need to get on the offensive with these guys.

1421
01:26:26,720 --> 01:26:28,560
Well, yeah, you're absolutely right.

1422
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:31,860
And that's the move I think is most important, that we go on the offense.

1423
01:26:31,860 --> 01:26:35,520
Right now, we've been defending against the thing, he comes out and does something, and

1424
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:36,520
we react to it.

1425
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:39,200
Well, that needs to stop, it needs to stop immediately.

1426
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:44,520
And we need to move against him confidently, not being afraid of all the stereotypes and

1427
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:47,600
all the things that have protected him over the past three years.

1428
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:53,040
So offense is indeed the defense that we need to employ against Obama at this time.

1429
01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:54,960
Why do you think they're in such a hurry to get the guns?

1430
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:57,400
I mean, the Germans are demanding their gold back.

1431
01:26:57,400 --> 01:27:00,840
We know that they're raising taxes, the economy's gonna crater.

1432
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:03,040
I mean, what is Obama's endgame?

1433
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:08,560
I think the economy getting ready to crater is perhaps one of the pressing reasons why

1434
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:13,000
Obama wants to take the guns, because we're gonna see ourselves in another year or so

1435
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:18,000
out in the streets begging for bread, or at least the economy being so cratered that people

1436
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:21,680
will be unemployed and people will be ready to take to the streets.

1437
01:27:21,680 --> 01:27:24,120
So that's the reason why he needs guns out of the hands of people.

1438
01:27:24,120 --> 01:27:29,080
But the other thing, Alex, I told you that when I was on your broadcast, I think three

1439
01:27:29,080 --> 01:27:34,000
or four years ago, that Obama does not want to give up this power that he has.

1440
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:40,100
But unlike any other president, he is closer to and employs more power than any other president

1441
01:27:40,100 --> 01:27:42,400
in the history of this nation.

1442
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:47,880
And he very possibly sees the opportunity to stay in office as long as he possibly can.

1443
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:52,720
Martial law is one way, and if calling for martial law, he can have guns on the street.

1444
01:27:52,720 --> 01:27:56,620
So take them out of the way right away, remove that obstacle, and then deploy the other kinds

1445
01:27:56,620 --> 01:27:58,800
of things he wants to do.

1446
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:03,520
You know, a congressman has pointed it out, you pointed it out so eloquently about Obama's

1447
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:07,160
the king, Biden's his queen, the little kids are pawns.

1448
01:28:07,160 --> 01:28:11,200
We've got to come up with a 3D graphic of that or something for the nightly news pastor.

1449
01:28:11,200 --> 01:28:15,760
But I mean, I think Obama's got a problem overreaching using these little kids like

1450
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:16,760
pawns.

1451
01:28:16,760 --> 01:28:19,120
I mean, this was a sickening display.

1452
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:22,200
That's exactly the kind of stuff Saddam Hussein pulled.

1453
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:25,800
Normally, I can stomach a lot of stuff, Alex.

1454
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:30,840
And when Obama has crowds of black people or Hispanic people or whoever behind him,

1455
01:28:30,840 --> 01:28:31,840
women or whoever.

1456
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:37,160
I mean, I can deal with it, it's just politics, he's promoting himself, they want an opportunity

1457
01:28:37,160 --> 01:28:38,160
to be there.

1458
01:28:38,160 --> 01:28:43,600
But this was a terrible misuse, a bastard misuse of these children today.

1459
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:48,840
And calling their names and using them to promote his diabolical plans, I thought was

1460
01:28:48,840 --> 01:28:51,400
just off the charts.

1461
01:28:51,400 --> 01:28:55,160
Well you're right, again, Pastor Manning, we've only got about a minute left, anything

1462
01:28:55,160 --> 01:28:57,440
else you think is important to add for folks?

1463
01:28:57,440 --> 01:29:00,200
Well, I want to ask America to pray for you, Alex.

1464
01:29:00,200 --> 01:29:05,800
I mean, I don't think people realize just how serious this issue is.

1465
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:11,420
Obama wants our guns, he wants this nation, he wants to trash the Constitution and you

1466
01:29:11,420 --> 01:29:15,800
are a powerful voice that have fired up the American people.

1467
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:21,000
And people need to stand with you, they need to pray for you, that God will sustain you

1468
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:22,640
through this battle that's ahead of us.

1469
01:29:22,640 --> 01:29:27,200
So my one request before leaving today is that all Americans would bow their knee and

1470
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:32,920
their heads in continual prayer for your safety and your abilities to keep doing what you're

1471
01:29:32,920 --> 01:29:33,920
doing.

1472
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:34,920
Wow, thank you, Pastor.

1473
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:37,800
We need to pray for you as well and for everybody fighting against evil.

1474
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:39,720
But I know it's the prayers that are sustaining me.

1475
01:29:39,720 --> 01:29:42,920
From the bottom of my heart, I feel that connection with you, Pastor.

1476
01:29:42,920 --> 01:29:43,920
Thank you, sir.

1477
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:44,920
God bless you, sir.

1478
01:29:44,920 --> 01:29:45,920
God bless you.

1479
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:50,120
Man, we'll be right back with State Rep who's fighting.

1480
01:29:50,120 --> 01:30:02,680

The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.

1495
01:31:08,320 --> 01:31:14,360
The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce

1496
01:31:14,360 --> 01:31:15,360
to the global takeover.

Millions of people are going to get sick this winter from colds, flu and other illnesses.

1528
01:33:11,800 --> 01:33:31,680
You are listening to the Alex Jones Show.

1529
01:33:31,680 --> 01:33:34,940
Ladies and gentlemen, we're joined for the balance of the hour and I promise everybody

1530
01:33:34,940 --> 01:33:40,120
holding, we're gonna get to all your calls for the entire third hour and cover this foggy

1531
01:33:40,120 --> 01:33:44,040
legislation but it's not foggy and so I have this huge responsibility.

1532
01:33:44,040 --> 01:33:47,500
I'm gonna go back to all our articles we've written the last two weeks, well even before

1533
01:33:47,500 --> 01:33:52,680
that the last month where we went back through Handgun Control Incorporated and these different

1534
01:33:52,680 --> 01:33:56,920
meetings they've had that have been on C-SPAN with the Attorney General and others and they've

1535
01:33:56,920 --> 01:33:58,760
laid out what they're gonna do.

1536
01:33:58,760 --> 01:34:03,560
And they're just gonna pull over gun owners and harass you.

1537
01:34:03,560 --> 01:34:07,240
They're going to raid people's houses claiming you've got illegal guns.

1538
01:34:07,240 --> 01:34:12,240
They're going to just say, we say you're mentally ill, you can't own a gun now.

1539
01:34:12,240 --> 01:34:16,520
They're gonna, upwards of $5 billion additional funding to harass gun owners.

1540
01:34:16,520 --> 01:34:20,280
They're gonna try to ram through legislation to physically make you turn them in, Dianne

1541
01:34:20,280 --> 01:34:22,440
Feinstein has that.

1542
01:34:22,440 --> 01:34:28,660
And it's totally, absolutely unconstitutional.

1543
01:34:28,660 --> 01:34:32,200
And it's unconstitutional on its face and we have President Obama running four years

1544
01:34:32,200 --> 01:34:35,380
ago pledging to never try to take any guns.

1545
01:34:35,380 --> 01:34:39,660
And you have the FBI crime statistics of gun crime the last 15, 16 years, we're gonna show

1546
01:34:39,660 --> 01:34:45,820
these again in a moment, down 49% nationwide on average and 20 plus percent reduction in

1547
01:34:45,820 --> 01:34:47,320
total violent crime.

1548
01:34:47,320 --> 01:34:52,320
I mean, the big secret is crime where guns are used is going way down, but I don't wanna

1549
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:54,040
hog the time here.

1550
01:34:54,040 --> 01:35:01,200
Representative Steve Toth joins us and he's made national news coming up with a legislative

1551
01:35:01,200 --> 01:35:08,000
plan to battle back against this and for the state of Texas to not recognize unconstitutional

1552
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:09,160
federal laws.

1553
01:35:09,160 --> 01:35:12,200
Even if they tried to get, just to explain to people cuz I was watching them on both

1554
01:35:12,200 --> 01:35:15,280
Blitzer and he'll be able to elaborate on this, Blitzer was interrupting him, acting

1555
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:17,640
like it was just preposterous.

1556
01:35:17,640 --> 01:35:21,280
Congress could pass a law saying turn your guns in, it's really unconstitutional and

1557
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:24,960
abhorrent and you'd have to get a constitutional amendment.

1558
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:29,600
And even that is highly debatable because it doesn't give you the right, it points out

1559
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:34,080
the unalienable, unalienable right that's already there.

1560
01:35:34,080 --> 01:35:39,520
So he joins us, his career began at a company, a Johnson and Johnson company and led to work

1561
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:43,360
as a regional trainer where he developed in a practice management consulting program called

1562
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:45,520
a residency to retirement.

1563
01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:51,040
He served as director of marketing for Apple, it goes on 99.

1564
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:54,800
The point is he is a entrepreneur out there and not one of these sponges.

1565
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:58,840
And he's been involved with the Tea Party and involved in a lot of different community

1566
01:35:58,840 --> 01:36:00,640
and church organizations.

1567
01:36:00,640 --> 01:36:05,160
And it's just really exciting to have him join us.

1568
01:36:05,160 --> 01:36:08,960
State Representative Steve Toth, thank you so much for coming on, sir.

1569
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:11,520
Hey, Alex, thanks so much for having me.

1570
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:12,520
You bet.

1571
01:36:12,520 --> 01:36:15,120
I mean, I'm chomping at the bit here because this is so outrageous.

1572
01:36:15,120 --> 01:36:18,040
Why do you think Obama's coming for the guns?

1573
01:36:18,040 --> 01:36:21,680
And what do you think of him like Saddam Hussein surrounding himself with children, and then

1574
01:36:21,680 --> 01:36:22,680
we'll move into your legislation?

1575
01:36:22,680 --> 01:36:26,440
Well, I mean, it goes all the way back to Rahm Emanuel.

1576
01:36:26,440 --> 01:36:30,040
Don't let any crisis go to waste.

1577
01:36:30,040 --> 01:36:31,040
This is part of their agenda.

1578
01:36:31,040 --> 01:36:37,240
This has always been part of their agenda to make it difficult for law abiding citizens

1579
01:36:37,240 --> 01:36:41,480
to own a gun.

1580
01:36:41,480 --> 01:36:42,480
What was your take?

1581
01:36:42,480 --> 01:36:45,400
Did you have a chance to watch his speech?

1582
01:36:45,400 --> 01:36:46,880
Yeah, I did.

1583
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:51,480
I was actually in the studio here in Austin while he was giving the speech.

1584
01:36:51,480 --> 01:36:57,160
And again, it's funny because Wolf Blitzer said, after it was done, he said he gave it

1585
01:36:57,160 --> 01:36:58,160
in great detail.

1586
01:36:58,160 --> 01:37:03,560
Well, I'm sorry, there are 23 things, and he laid out maybe three or four of them.

1587
01:37:03,560 --> 01:37:06,560
And at the end of the day, this is no different than Obamacare.

1588
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:11,080
You deliver a bill that's 4,000 pages that no one has a chance to read, it gets voted

1589
01:37:11,080 --> 01:37:17,120
in, and then it goes miraculously, it goes from 4,000 pages to 40,000 pages.

1590
01:37:17,120 --> 01:37:19,080
And this is how he does things.

1591
01:37:19,080 --> 01:37:25,480
It's just, at some point, we've got to say enough is enough, and stand up and say our

1592
01:37:25,480 --> 01:37:26,480
Constitution matters.

1593
01:37:26,480 --> 01:37:32,200
We're not a democracy, we're a constitutional republic.

1594
01:37:32,200 --> 01:37:34,680
We don't vote on whether or not we have liberty.

1595
01:37:34,680 --> 01:37:39,120
We don't vote on whether or not you can or can't do something.

1596
01:37:39,120 --> 01:37:44,320
We have this article, it's called the Constitution, our rights come from God and are enumerated

1597
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:45,320
in that document.

1598
01:37:45,320 --> 01:37:50,040
And it's very clear about what we can and can't do.

1599
01:37:50,040 --> 01:37:56,240
I agree with you, and your call for the Second Amendment Preservation Act here in Texas has

1600
01:37:56,240 --> 01:37:57,800
become a big national story.

1601
01:37:57,800 --> 01:38:04,220
A lot of other states are saying they're gonna try to introduce similar legislation.

1602
01:38:04,220 --> 01:38:08,840
And the Wolf Blitzer was trying to interrupt you so that you couldn't explain the constitutionality

1603
01:38:08,840 --> 01:38:13,180
of this and how it works, but I want you to be able to elaborate on it.

1604
01:38:13,180 --> 01:38:19,000
But expanding on that, 800 plus cities, 30-something states last time I checked, don't arrest illegal

1605
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:22,320
aliens for even drunk driving because they're just above the law.

1606
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:25,760
They don't arrest them for being illegal, they don't even take them to be deported.

1607
01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:29,800
They won't deport most of them most of the time now because Obama signed an order.

1608
01:38:29,800 --> 01:38:34,360
Now that's all unconstitutional with the feds and the states ignoring the law.

1609
01:38:34,360 --> 01:38:38,160
Well, why can't we ignore federal laws if they're clearly unconstitutional?

1610
01:38:38,160 --> 01:38:43,320
Exactly, I mean, you nailed it, you absolutely nailed it.

1611
01:38:43,320 --> 01:38:46,800
At some point you've got to draw a line in the sand and say, enough is enough, we're

1612
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:53,400
not sliding anymore towards a king.

1613
01:38:53,400 --> 01:38:55,840
I grew up in upstate New York.

1614
01:38:55,840 --> 01:39:02,400
I moved my family here because we believed it was the greatest state in the nation, greatest

1615
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:07,520
opportunity to raise our children in freedom and prosperity.

1616
01:39:07,520 --> 01:39:12,160
And the thing that gets me about what's going on in New York right now, where they're

1617
01:39:12,160 --> 01:39:19,760
limiting lawful people to own a gun, make it more difficult for them to get a gun, it

1618
01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:25,760
was just three or four weeks ago that this crazed killer, this is a guy that beat his

1619
01:39:25,760 --> 01:39:30,520
mother to death with a hammer, he beat his mother to death with a hammer, bludgeoned

1620
01:39:30,520 --> 01:39:31,520
her head with a hammer.

1621
01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:39,400
And oh, by the way, more people died from being bludgeoned with a hammer than any kind

1622
01:39:39,400 --> 01:39:41,320
of rifle, let alone an assault rifle.

1623
01:39:41,320 --> 01:39:42,320
That's right.

1624
01:39:42,320 --> 01:39:44,840
He beat his mother to death with a hammer.

1625
01:39:44,840 --> 01:39:55,000
And then the libs in New York sent him to jail, where they promptly let him out.

1626
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:56,000
They promptly let him out.

1627
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:57,000
What did he do?

1628
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:03,800
He set his house on fire a few weeks ago, shot two volunteer firefighters, first responders,

1629
01:40:03,800 --> 01:40:06,680
people that, you know, give their lives to save others.

1630
01:40:06,680 --> 01:40:10,160
He shot them like a coward that he is.

1631
01:40:10,160 --> 01:40:11,880
He shot them dead.

1632
01:40:11,880 --> 01:40:15,240
And what does New York state legislation do?

1633
01:40:15,240 --> 01:40:19,100
Rather than getting on TV and saying, boy, we blew it.

1634
01:40:19,100 --> 01:40:22,520
We haven't made it tough enough on criminals.

1635
01:40:22,520 --> 01:40:24,880
We should have locked this guy away and thrown away the key.

1636
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:29,280
We should have put legislation in place to ensure that this guy would never see another

1637
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:30,280
sunset again.

1638
01:40:30,280 --> 01:40:32,280
Instead, what do they do?

1639
01:40:32,280 --> 01:40:34,400
It's this baloney.

1640
01:40:34,400 --> 01:40:37,560
They go and create legislation that has nothing to do.

1641
01:40:37,560 --> 01:40:38,560
This guy got this gun illegally.

1642
01:40:38,560 --> 01:40:40,560
He didn't buy it at a gun show.

1643
01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:43,360
He didn't buy it at a shop.

1644
01:40:43,360 --> 01:40:45,360
This was a stolen weapon.

1645
01:40:45,360 --> 01:40:50,700
And just, we don't want to have a real discussion about what to do.

1646
01:40:50,700 --> 01:40:51,960
We just want theatrics.

1647
01:40:51,960 --> 01:40:53,640
We just want games.

1648
01:40:53,640 --> 01:40:58,600
And it's just, again, it's just another opportunity to erode our rights.

1649
01:40:58,600 --> 01:40:59,600
I agree.

1650
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:04,520
State representative hailing from Texas, Steve Toth, is our guest.

1651
01:41:04,520 --> 01:41:07,640
And we're going to give you his website as well as you want to get behind him and support

1652
01:41:07,640 --> 01:41:08,640
him.

1653
01:41:08,640 --> 01:41:10,040
But here's the bottom line.

1654
01:41:10,040 --> 01:41:14,860
We either get on the offensive like you're doing or it's over because they are going

1655
01:41:14,860 --> 01:41:16,240
to use these dead children.

1656
01:41:16,240 --> 01:41:20,040
They are going to wrap themselves around this tragedy.

1657
01:41:20,040 --> 01:41:26,560
They are going to bill all gun owners as responsible, calling the NRA mass murder enablers, saying

1658
01:41:26,560 --> 01:41:32,440
gun owners are all secretly Ku Klux Klan as Fox Sports, has said, we either get on the

1659
01:41:32,440 --> 01:41:36,920
offensive and say, in every case, and it's now come out with a Batman shooter that he

1660
01:41:36,920 --> 01:41:38,720
was on a bunch of psychotropic drugs.

1661
01:41:38,720 --> 01:41:42,880
They've been on drugs where the inserts say they can cause you to commit mass murder or

1662
01:41:42,880 --> 01:41:44,760
kill yourself, a massive increase.

1663
01:41:44,760 --> 01:41:50,480
The guy that shot an Austin cop for no reason, no reason at a Walmart, was bombed out of

1664
01:41:50,480 --> 01:41:53,040
his brain on Xanax.

1665
01:41:53,040 --> 01:41:57,720
He was a Xanax addict, taking more than what you're even supposed to.

1666
01:41:57,720 --> 01:42:00,360
I mean, I've known people on Xanax, it destroys their lives.

1667
01:42:00,360 --> 01:42:03,480
I mean, I've talked to doctors who will not prescribe it.

1668
01:42:03,480 --> 01:42:06,200
And of course, I mean, I heard this guy shot a cop for no reason.

1669
01:42:06,200 --> 01:42:07,920
I said, I bet that guy's on psychotropics.

1670
01:42:07,920 --> 01:42:11,400
Boom, he was on antipsychotic, basically.

1671
01:42:11,400 --> 01:42:16,280
And now the Batman shooter, Harris, Kleibold, in like 99% of the cases, they're trying to

1672
01:42:16,280 --> 01:42:21,280
suppress the file on Lanza, who tried to buy a gun, not once, not twice, not three times,

1673
01:42:21,280 --> 01:42:25,000
not four times, five times the month before, couldn't.

1674
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:28,920
His mother had gone through some of the strictest gun laws in the country to get these semi-autos,

1675
01:42:28,920 --> 01:42:30,840
if you believe the story.

1676
01:42:30,840 --> 01:42:35,840
And again, they ignore all that and say, because a guy that murdered his mother with a hammer

1677
01:42:35,840 --> 01:42:39,720
went and got an illegal gun and shot people, I've gotta give my guns up.

1678
01:42:39,720 --> 01:42:44,300
Because a guy went and killed his mommy and went and killed, it's always devil-worshipping

1679
01:42:44,300 --> 01:42:45,600
goths on drugs.

1680
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:48,880
I mean, if anybody needs to be profiled, it's these guys.

1681
01:42:48,880 --> 01:42:50,960
Instead, I've gotta lose my rights.

1682
01:42:50,960 --> 01:42:53,800
So what about getting on the offensive here?

1683
01:42:53,800 --> 01:42:57,080
Yeah, that's it, exactly.

1684
01:42:57,080 --> 01:43:01,520
I mean, everyone in every state has gotta take an interest in this thing.

1685
01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:04,600
If you think that this is just about guns, you're crazy.

1686
01:43:04,600 --> 01:43:08,440
This is about eroding all of your rights.

1687
01:43:08,440 --> 01:43:14,120
And I said to Governor Perry last night, and he's behind this as well, and I had such great

1688
01:43:14,120 --> 01:43:15,120
discussion with him.

1689
01:43:15,120 --> 01:43:20,200
He walked up to me when I was talking to him about the bill and he grabbed me by both arms

1690
01:43:20,200 --> 01:43:25,440
and he said, he said, Steve, this isn't about hunting, this isn't about my right to be a

1691
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:26,440
sportsman.

1692
01:43:26,440 --> 01:43:30,480
If I want to use an assault-style rifle to kill hogs, that's my right.

1693
01:43:30,480 --> 01:43:34,280
And if I don't want to kill hogs and I just want to have that in my gun safe in case I

1694
01:43:34,280 --> 01:43:38,840
need it against the federal government or whatever, that's my right.

1695
01:43:38,840 --> 01:43:39,840
He is just a liberty-loving.

1696
01:43:39,840 --> 01:43:40,840
Absolutely.

1697
01:43:40,840 --> 01:43:46,720
And I'm thankful he's my governor, but the deal is y'all need to reach out to your elected

1698
01:43:46,720 --> 01:43:47,720
officials.

1699
01:43:47,720 --> 01:43:51,720
This is a fight that we all need to be involved in, and it's not just about guns, it's how

1700
01:43:51,720 --> 01:43:57,200
we educate our children, it's the kind of food that we eat and drink, it's everything.

1701
01:43:57,200 --> 01:43:59,320
We've gotta stop this and we've gotta stop it now.

1702
01:43:59,320 --> 01:44:03,080
Well, I mean, I disagree with Rick Perry on quite a few things like the NAFTA highway

1703
01:44:03,080 --> 01:44:11,760
and stuff, but the governor has been resisting and really defending the Second Amendment.

1704
01:44:11,760 --> 01:44:13,680
And we need to see more of that.

1705
01:44:13,680 --> 01:44:19,320
And I've gotta say, I'm proud of Texas, but also Kentucky, Washington State, many other

1706
01:44:19,320 --> 01:44:21,080
states that are resisting.

1707
01:44:21,080 --> 01:44:27,120
But I have introduced into the public forum articles of impeachment.

1708
01:44:27,120 --> 01:44:32,520
And we've got a Texas congressman who has said he will introduce articles of impeachment.

1709
01:44:32,520 --> 01:44:38,100
If Obama tries to use executive orders, well, now he's saying 23 executive orders, but like

1710
01:44:38,100 --> 01:44:40,880
you said earlier, won't tell us what they are.

1711
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:46,620
Well, I know what they've said they're gonna do, because the anti-gun groups have press

1712
01:44:46,620 --> 01:44:47,620
conferences on C-SPAN.

1713
01:44:47,620 --> 01:44:49,800
I mean, I know what they're gonna do.

1714
01:44:49,800 --> 01:44:54,600
They're just gonna have the federal government put you on a list, no judge, no jury, and

1715
01:44:54,600 --> 01:44:55,880
say you can't own a gun.

1716
01:44:55,880 --> 01:44:56,880
They're gonna ban importation.

1717
01:44:56,880 --> 01:44:57,880
Go ahead.

1718
01:44:57,880 --> 01:45:05,960
A couple days ago, he was talking about there's got to be an administrative fix or solution.

1719
01:45:05,960 --> 01:45:07,800
That's code for registering our guns.

1720
01:45:07,800 --> 01:45:08,800
I'm just here to tell you.

1721
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:09,800
No, that's it.

1722
01:45:09,800 --> 01:45:10,800
Yeah.

1723
01:45:10,800 --> 01:45:11,800
That's it in a nutshell.

1724
01:45:11,800 --> 01:45:15,600
And when that happens, we're done.

1725
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:16,600
We're just done.

1726
01:45:16,600 --> 01:45:21,980
And, you know, frankly, there needs to be some outrage for those of you that are listening

1727
01:45:21,980 --> 01:45:29,800
in New York, and again, Sheldon Silver and the outrageous leadership that he has demonstrated

1728
01:45:29,800 --> 01:45:35,200
in the state of New York, what he's brought that state down to, it's just a shame.

1729
01:45:35,200 --> 01:45:41,840
Well, it's so creepy that Bloomberg and Cuomo and all these people, Diane Feinstein is introduced

1730
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:46,600
to Bill, that says you'll have to come re-register your guns and they can, quote, do a forced

1731
01:45:46,600 --> 01:45:50,740
buyback if they want, all this vague, really draconian language.

1732
01:45:50,740 --> 01:45:54,440
They've all got concealed carry, I've played clips for admitting it, and bodyguards.

1733
01:45:54,440 --> 01:45:58,360
I mean, she's worth $100 million in her financial filings.

1734
01:45:58,360 --> 01:46:02,560
Most people, I mean, I'm a successful talk show host, but I mean, I don't have the money

1735
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:04,040
to have bodyguards and stuff.

1736
01:46:04,040 --> 01:46:07,440
I mean, I know you don't have the money to have bodyguards, I would guess.

1737
01:46:07,440 --> 01:46:08,440
I don't either.

1738
01:46:08,440 --> 01:46:12,520
My campaign manager two years ago was walking through the, Bruce, if you're listening, love

1739
01:46:12,520 --> 01:46:18,880
you buddy, but as he was walking through the parking lot at the Woodlands Mall, two guys

1740
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:23,880
started following him, so he starts taking the circuitous route around cars and everything,

1741
01:46:23,880 --> 01:46:25,200
and sure enough, they're still following him.

1742
01:46:25,200 --> 01:46:31,040
He walks around a van, drops a package, draws, and as they came around the corner, he looked

1743
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:34,120
at these two guys and said, yes, can I help you?

1744
01:46:34,120 --> 01:46:35,800
And they took off running.

1745
01:46:35,800 --> 01:46:44,760
He immediately called 911, and like any good concealed handgun licensed owner, he said,

1746
01:46:44,760 --> 01:46:46,000
I was in fear of my life.

1747
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:50,920
Two men were coming after me, and I drew, and the police arrived.

1748
01:46:50,920 --> 01:46:55,440
He described them, and he said, you know, those two guys, we've been trying to catch

1749
01:46:55,440 --> 01:46:56,440
them.

1750
01:46:56,440 --> 01:46:59,600
Good thing you didn't shoot them, but we've been trying to catch those guys.

1751
01:46:59,600 --> 01:47:07,480
They mugged two people that day, so evidently the president and Nancy Pelosi and Dianne

1752
01:47:07,480 --> 01:47:15,720
Feinstein, they're allowed to have protection, but I'm not allowed to protect myself.

1753
01:47:15,720 --> 01:47:16,720
It's incredible.

1754
01:47:16,720 --> 01:47:22,640
I mean, we have crime maps from local governments compiled then by the FBI, and you can see

1755
01:47:22,640 --> 01:47:27,360
where you have increased gun ownership, you have lower home invasions, lower crime rates,

1756
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:32,440
lower muggings, lower carjackings, and the area where people are disarmed is where this

1757
01:47:32,440 --> 01:47:33,440
happens.

1758
01:47:33,440 --> 01:47:37,640
I mean, I've been in New York myself, and I weigh 260 pounds, and I'm a pretty strong

1759
01:47:37,640 --> 01:47:38,640
guy.

1760
01:47:38,640 --> 01:47:43,160
I mean, I'm not like He-Man or something, but I can bench press 350 pounds, stuff like

1761
01:47:43,160 --> 01:47:44,160
that.

1762
01:47:44,160 --> 01:47:48,200
I've had guys come and sit on both sides of me and ask me what's in my bag and stuff and

1763
01:47:48,200 --> 01:47:49,200
try to intimidate me.

1764
01:47:49,200 --> 01:47:50,200
Yeah.

1765
01:47:50,200 --> 01:47:55,640
I mean, this is not the way I want to live, and it's just so despicable that these mob

1766
01:47:55,640 --> 01:48:02,440
boss types like Rahm Emanuel and people consciously have this criminal instinct to want to disarm

1767
01:48:02,440 --> 01:48:03,440
us.

1768
01:48:03,440 --> 01:48:04,440
Right.

1769
01:48:04,440 --> 01:48:06,400
That's it in a nutshell.

1770
01:48:06,400 --> 01:48:10,760
Anything that they can do, you know, we don't have the Second Amendment for hunting.

1771
01:48:10,760 --> 01:48:15,360
We don't have the Second Amendment for putting trophy guns on our wall.

1772
01:48:15,360 --> 01:48:20,000
We have the Second Amendment so that we can preserve the First Amendment, which is the

1773
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:23,040
free right to assemble and free speech.

1774
01:48:23,040 --> 01:48:26,360
And when people live in fear of the government, we will have tyranny.

1775
01:48:26,360 --> 01:48:32,640
And as soon as they take our guns away from us, and again, this is a slow erosion, we

1776
01:48:32,640 --> 01:48:34,440
will lose that freedom.

1777
01:48:34,440 --> 01:48:37,840
And we've got to get to the point where we say enough is enough and stand up.

1778
01:48:37,840 --> 01:48:42,280
Well, sure, if the federal government wasn't buying 1.6 billion hollow point bullets, if

1779
01:48:42,280 --> 01:48:45,960
they weren't deploying armored personnel carriers, if they weren't dressing like Darth Vader,

1780
01:48:45,960 --> 01:48:49,480
and they weren't trying to gut our borders and calling for world government, if they

1781
01:48:49,480 --> 01:48:56,280
didn't have four network TV shows bad mouthing the founding fathers, I mean, these are obvious

1782
01:48:56,280 --> 01:48:57,280
usurpers.

1783
01:48:57,280 --> 01:49:01,720
They're going down the list of things tyrants do and double checking every box.

1784
01:49:01,720 --> 01:49:06,400
So that's all the more reasons, like Jesse Ventura said, when the government disarms

1785
01:49:06,400 --> 01:49:09,320
and the government lays down its guns, then I'll think about it.

1786
01:49:09,320 --> 01:49:11,040
And obviously, that's tongue in cheek.

1787
01:49:11,040 --> 01:49:14,800
The point is, is that they are arming against us.

1788
01:49:14,800 --> 01:49:17,160
We need our guns to protect ourselves.

1789
01:49:17,160 --> 01:49:22,200
And the media always tries to act like, wow, the state rep just said we need guns to protect

1790
01:49:22,200 --> 01:49:23,200
ourselves from the federal government.

1791
01:49:23,200 --> 01:49:25,200
Well, that's what the founders said.

1792
01:49:25,200 --> 01:49:27,320
And if you don't like that, you're not an American.

1793
01:49:27,320 --> 01:49:29,920
No, I mean, that's not like a new thought.

1794
01:49:29,920 --> 01:49:38,440
I mean, this is something that our founding fathers knew that just like gravity, you know,

1795
01:49:38,440 --> 01:49:41,440
you hold something in there and you drop it, it's going to hit the ground.

1796
01:49:41,440 --> 01:49:47,040
Our liberty, our freedom will erode from the gravity of tyranny.

1797
01:49:47,040 --> 01:49:48,040
It's the slow erosion.

1798
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:49,760
It's not a quick on off switch.

1799
01:49:49,760 --> 01:49:51,600
It's the slow erosion.

1800
01:49:51,600 --> 01:49:55,920
And we have got to be on guard against it.

1801
01:49:55,920 --> 01:50:00,720
It is speeding up at an astronomical rate, exponential rate.

1802
01:50:00,720 --> 01:50:07,520
So yeah, I mean, and yes, our founding fathers said, when government lives in fear of the

1803
01:50:07,520 --> 01:50:09,160
people, there's liberty.

1804
01:50:09,160 --> 01:50:11,560
When people live in fear of the government, there's tyranny.

1805
01:50:11,560 --> 01:50:12,560
They understood that.

1806
01:50:12,560 --> 01:50:16,420
They understood it well because of what they endured through King George.

1807
01:50:16,420 --> 01:50:17,420
We don't want another king.

1808
01:50:17,420 --> 01:50:23,280
When we come back, I know listeners already have heard your report on on the WOAI.

1809
01:50:23,280 --> 01:50:24,280
It's already made national news.

1810
01:50:24,280 --> 01:50:27,080
They have the drugs report dot com and info wars dot com.

1811
01:50:27,080 --> 01:50:28,480
But I want to come back and give out your website.

1812
01:50:28,480 --> 01:50:33,800
But I also want to talk about what your piece of proposed legislation would do and how we

1813
01:50:33,800 --> 01:50:35,040
would implement it.

1814
01:50:35,040 --> 01:50:36,040
And it's very, very simple.

1815
01:50:36,040 --> 01:50:39,400
I mean, the feds won't even pick up the illegal aliens and police do arrest them.

1816
01:50:39,400 --> 01:50:43,760
I've talked to the police has been on the news show if that's illegal and unconstitutional

1817
01:50:43,760 --> 01:50:47,920
because that's something you're supposed to do, then how can the states get in trouble

1818
01:50:47,920 --> 01:50:50,760
if they don't do something that's unconstitutional?

1819
01:50:50,760 --> 01:50:54,680
So we're going to talk about your piece of legislation and how we can get it duplicated

1820
01:50:54,680 --> 01:50:58,720
and different ways we can get on the offense against this tyranny with the representative

1821
01:50:58,720 --> 01:51:00,920
from Texas.

1822
01:51:00,920 --> 01:51:07,040

Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

1828
01:51:31,760 --> 01:51:35,560
Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold

1829
01:51:35,560 --> 01:51:36,560
IRAs?

1830
01:51:36,560 --> 01:51:40,560
They've been available since 1986 yet the financial industry won't recognize the value

1831
01:51:40,560 --> 01:51:42,260
of gold for your retirement.

1832
01:51:42,260 --> 01:51:45,740
Gold is outperformed paper investments yet no word about IRAs.

1833
01:51:45,740 --> 01:51:51,560
If you would like to have gold for your retirement call 800-686-2237 don't get left behind by

1835
01:52:01,960 --> 01:52:04,240
Hey there, Frank Bates here.

1836
01:52:04,240 --> 01:52:09,320
Have you heard about the weird device that could wipe out 280 million Americans?

1837
01:52:09,320 --> 01:52:11,380
This is really scary stuff.

1838
01:52:11,380 --> 01:52:16,340
Vince experts warn that this odd device poses the greatest threat we've ever known.

1839
01:52:16,340 --> 01:52:20,640
In fact, just a few weeks ago former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich wrote an op-ed

1840
01:52:20,640 --> 01:52:23,880
piece for the Washington Post warning about this deadly threat.

1841
01:52:23,880 --> 01:52:27,180
I can't believe that more people aren't talking about this.

1842
01:52:27,180 --> 01:52:31,080
It may be because the liberals and the government are trying to cover it up.

1843
01:52:31,080 --> 01:52:36,760
That's why my friend just created a free video at weirddevice.com that exposes this threat

1844
01:52:36,760 --> 01:52:39,560
and blows the doors off the conspiracy.

Again, that's weirddevice.com.

1850
01:52:59,720 --> 01:53:04,000

1865
01:54:08,880 --> 01:54:29,480
Now you noticed Obama just said, I want to give everybody free healthcare, you deserve

1866
01:54:29,480 --> 01:54:30,480
it.

1867
01:54:30,480 --> 01:54:34,000
And then we finally get the bill, it's death panels, it's written by the insurance companies

1868
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:38,520
to double your rates, doesn't give anybody free healthcare.

1869
01:54:38,520 --> 01:54:41,880
Obama says, I'm not gonna raise taxes unless you make a quarter million dollars a year,

1870
01:54:41,880 --> 01:54:42,880
I promise.

1871
01:54:42,880 --> 01:54:47,200
Raises a bunch of taxes on poor people, massively.

1872
01:54:47,200 --> 01:54:51,480
I have a responsibility because they bragged to the Washington Post, I've read their quotes,

1873
01:54:51,480 --> 01:54:53,620
I've watched their press conferences.

1874
01:54:53,620 --> 01:54:58,260
We know their attack profile, we know what the 23 executive actions are gonna be.

1875
01:54:58,260 --> 01:55:02,760
We know, and he hinted at a bunch of them in the speech, but I was talking to state

1876
01:55:02,760 --> 01:55:08,100
representative here from Texas who's introduced the Firearms Preservation Act.

1877
01:55:08,100 --> 01:55:14,320
And Steve, continuing with what you were breaking down during the break describing what Obama's

1878
01:55:14,320 --> 01:55:15,320
doing masterfully.

1879
01:55:15,320 --> 01:55:17,720
He's like, hey, I just don't want little kids to get killed.

1880
01:55:17,720 --> 01:55:23,320
I'm here, I'm gonna propose something, DHS is gonna run it nationwide, $5 billion, get

1881
01:55:23,320 --> 01:55:24,320
ready.

1882
01:55:24,320 --> 01:55:27,320
Yeah, I mean, he's masterful at this.

1883
01:55:27,320 --> 01:55:33,200
It's smoke and mirrors, you hide behind children, you pull the heartstrings to make an emotional

1884
01:55:33,200 --> 01:55:36,160
connection with moms and dads.

1885
01:55:36,160 --> 01:55:44,720
And then you introduce this nebulous legislation, and then once the ne'er-do-wells in Washington

1886
01:55:44,720 --> 01:55:52,020
pass it, then what he does is he takes his bureaucrats, the only thing worse than a politician

1887
01:55:52,020 --> 01:55:56,880
that has been in office too long is a bureaucrat that has been in office too long.

1888
01:55:56,880 --> 01:56:01,720
And these bureaucrats are the ones that craft the legislation once it's passed.

1889
01:56:01,720 --> 01:56:05,640
Obamacare was only about 4,000 pages only, right?

1890
01:56:05,640 --> 01:56:12,480
But once it was the bill that you had to pass before you read it, well, that thing is upwards

1891
01:56:12,480 --> 01:56:15,440
of 40,000 pages of regulation today.

1892
01:56:15,440 --> 01:56:19,440
And the devil in this thing is really truly in the details, and you won't find out what

1893
01:56:19,440 --> 01:56:22,960
the details are, this is the way he does things.

1894
01:56:22,960 --> 01:56:27,360
The thing is that they're just too controversial to make it onto the House floor or the well

1895
01:56:27,360 --> 01:56:28,360
of the Senate.

1896
01:56:28,360 --> 01:56:33,380
That stuff isn't seen, it's not gonna be addressed in this legislation.

1897
01:56:33,380 --> 01:56:39,480
And so they're gonna keep it nice and nebulous, warm, fuzzy, children, puppies, and then pass

1898
01:56:39,480 --> 01:56:40,480
this.

1899
01:56:40,480 --> 01:56:44,320
And then you pass it and you find out that our guns are registered and they're being

1900
01:56:44,320 --> 01:56:45,320
taken away.

1901
01:56:45,320 --> 01:56:49,600
And by the way, that's what makes me so angry is that Dianne Feinstein, we have the clip

1902
01:56:49,600 --> 01:56:53,760
of her saying, if I have my way, all your guns are turned in, Mr. and Mrs. America.

1903
01:56:53,760 --> 01:56:58,720
And then I have her new bill where it says, yeah, you gotta come re-register them, we'll

1904
01:56:58,720 --> 01:57:02,600
decide if you can keep them, but we need money for a forced buyback.

1905
01:57:02,600 --> 01:57:07,680
And then Obama's up there going, it's just reasonable, we just want crazy people not

1906
01:57:07,680 --> 01:57:08,680
to have guns.

1907
01:57:08,680 --> 01:57:12,600
I mean, it's such a deception.

1908
01:57:12,600 --> 01:57:17,280
You'd think once the public learned that they lie so much, then everyone would turn against

1909
01:57:17,280 --> 01:57:18,280
them.

1910
01:57:18,280 --> 01:57:20,360
But it's almost like people have just gotten used to being lied to.

1911
01:57:20,360 --> 01:57:25,200
Well, check this out.

1912
01:57:25,200 --> 01:57:32,000
When the liberals say that the war on drugs has been an abject failure, they say it's

1913
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,200
because interdiction is impossible.

1914
01:57:34,200 --> 01:57:36,280
You can't keep drugs out of the country.

1915
01:57:36,280 --> 01:57:39,720
You can't keep drugs out of the hands of someone that wants drugs.

1916
01:57:39,720 --> 01:57:44,720
But evidently, they think you can't keep firearms out of the hands of criminals.

1917
01:57:44,720 --> 01:57:49,240
I mean, it's just pure- Well, that was my next point.

1918
01:57:49,240 --> 01:57:51,800
They're announcing Homeland Security's main duty.

1919
01:57:51,800 --> 01:57:53,240
It's not Al-Qaeda anymore.

1920
01:57:53,240 --> 01:57:57,600
You've seen the training manuals, gun owners, returning veterans, conservatives.

1921
01:57:57,600 --> 01:58:02,200
They're now announcing this is what Homeland Security is, is a new thing to harass and

1922
01:58:02,200 --> 01:58:07,580
nickel and dime gun owners, where somebody's got a legal AR-15, not modified, guy has no

1923
01:58:07,580 --> 01:58:10,760
criminal record, businessman, what was it in Minnesota.

1924
01:58:10,760 --> 01:58:16,140
He pulls the trigger at the shooting range, it goes full auto, they rat on him, and he

1925
01:58:16,140 --> 01:58:17,140
goes to jail.

1926
01:58:17,140 --> 01:58:21,680
And the ATF says, we know he didn't do it on purpose, but we still wanna put you in

1927
01:58:21,680 --> 01:58:22,680
jail.

1928
01:58:22,680 --> 01:58:23,680
Do five more minutes with us.

1929
01:58:23,680 --> 01:58:27,000
I know you've gotta go, but I wanna talk about your Firearms Preservation Act, how people

1930
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:28,000
find it.

1931
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,840
Fire out the best website, sir.

1932
01:58:30,840 --> 01:58:35,560
The best way to get ahold of us at this point is just on Facebook.

1933
01:58:35,560 --> 01:58:37,560
Steve for House District 15.

Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.

1949
01:59:24,800 --> 01:59:27,960
This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.

1950
01:59:27,960 --> 01:59:32,320
Save money by not buying bottled water and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.

1951
01:59:32,320 --> 01:59:35,000
ProPure is the best gravity fed filter out there.

1952
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:37,000
It's what my family uses.

1953

01:59:53,720 --> 02:00:05,400
Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.

1957
02:00:05,400 --> 02:00:10,240
Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.

1958
02:00:10,240 --> 02:00:11,240
You want answers?

1959
02:00:11,240 --> 02:00:13,360
Well, so does he.

1960
02:00:13,360 --> 02:00:17,560
He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.

1961
02:00:17,560 --> 02:00:23,520
And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.

1962
02:00:23,520 --> 02:00:28,520
State representative from Texas, Steve Toth, represents District 15.

1963
02:00:28,520 --> 02:00:30,560
And he is almost for five more minutes.

1964
02:00:30,560 --> 02:00:34,040
I've got some big breaking news after he leaves us in the next segment.

1965
02:00:34,040 --> 02:00:35,840
I'm just gonna leave it at that.

1966
02:00:35,840 --> 02:00:37,640
Big breaking news.

1967
02:00:37,640 --> 02:00:38,640
And this is confirmed.

1968
02:00:38,640 --> 02:00:43,360
This is, well, we'll break it down on the other side and go over what this means.

1969
02:00:43,360 --> 02:00:46,960
Getting into your State Preservation Act, tell people about that.

1970
02:00:46,960 --> 02:00:48,840
I guess they can go to Steve.

1971
02:00:48,840 --> 02:00:56,280
Steve Toth for House District 15 on Facebook.

1972
02:00:56,280 --> 02:01:00,680
So that's the best place to visit and- Yeah, that's the best place.

1973
02:01:00,680 --> 02:01:03,480
How do people find a piece of legislation?

1974
02:01:03,480 --> 02:01:06,080
How do they find a copy of it so they can get it to the-

1975
02:01:06,080 --> 02:01:09,160
Yeah, we're not out of legislative council yet.

1976
02:01:09,160 --> 02:01:11,880
So it's being drafted right now.

1977
02:01:11,880 --> 02:01:15,760
And we've been told that alleged counsel will be done Friday and then it's gonna be in the

1978
02:01:15,760 --> 02:01:17,760
hands of the Attorney General.

1979
02:01:17,760 --> 02:01:24,040
Reason being, we wanna make sure that it's buttoned up as best we can.

1980
02:01:24,040 --> 02:01:29,040
We're gonna put it in his hands and let him dot the I's and cross the T's and then we'll

1981
02:01:29,040 --> 02:01:30,680
go from there.

1982
02:01:30,680 --> 02:01:34,320
We only serve in Texas 140 days every two years.

1983
02:01:34,320 --> 02:01:37,320
And we can't introduce legislation in the first couple months.

1984
02:01:37,320 --> 02:01:43,120
So the neat thing about this, and you're probably familiar with the TSA bill that Representative

1985
02:01:43,120 --> 02:01:45,120
Simpson put through a couple years ago.

1986
02:01:45,120 --> 02:01:46,120
Absolutely.

1987
02:01:46,120 --> 02:01:48,080
What's the background?

1988
02:01:48,080 --> 02:01:54,280
Well, in the local radio station there in Houston said, well, I hope this isn't like

1989
02:01:54,280 --> 02:01:55,280
the TSA bill.

1990
02:01:55,280 --> 02:01:56,280
It didn't get passed.

1991
02:01:56,280 --> 02:02:01,840
Well, the TSA bill didn't catch fire until April or May last year.

1992
02:02:01,840 --> 02:02:03,240
It's January.

1993
02:02:03,240 --> 02:02:10,280
So the nice thing about where we're at right now is that, and thanks to Texans that have

1994
02:02:10,280 --> 02:02:14,320
just shown so much support for this thing that they're calling their elected officials

1995
02:02:14,320 --> 02:02:18,560
and saying, we're behind this, they're respectfully calling their officials and saying, we're

1996
02:02:18,560 --> 02:02:20,840
behind this and we appreciate it, you'd be behind it.

1997
02:02:20,840 --> 02:02:25,800
And that's the best way to talk to one of these people because at the end of the day,

1998
02:02:25,800 --> 02:02:28,800
we serve here.

1999
02:02:28,800 --> 02:02:33,360
It's really not even, I have a full time job, I own the company, I have employees, and I

2000
02:02:33,360 --> 02:02:37,840
do this on the side, I'm paid $600 a month, it barely covers your expense.

2001
02:02:37,840 --> 02:02:41,120
No, you're a statesman, you're what we need in there.

2002
02:02:41,120 --> 02:02:45,560
And I just appreciate you being on the front lines of this and we've got a good chance

2003
02:02:45,560 --> 02:02:50,800
to get this ram through and it will take time and we've got a good chance to get other states

2004
02:02:50,800 --> 02:02:58,160
to pick it up because what are, in closing, a few other areas we can get on the offense?

2005
02:02:58,160 --> 02:03:03,000
Reach out through social media to people and start the discussion.

2006
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:09,080
I'm amazed when you get under a liberal skin, they're calling my office right now, F bomb

2007
02:03:09,080 --> 02:03:11,800
after F bomb after F bomb.

2008
02:03:11,800 --> 02:03:17,320
Because they can't have an intellectual discussion around this because their position is just

2009
02:03:17,320 --> 02:03:18,320
so weak.

2010
02:03:18,320 --> 02:03:19,320
Well, they're authoritarians.

2011
02:03:19,320 --> 02:03:20,320
Unbelievable.

2012
02:03:20,320 --> 02:03:27,440
So yeah, I mean, we just need to ramp up the discussion and we need to do it with integrity

2013
02:03:27,440 --> 02:03:28,440
and honesty.

2014
02:03:28,440 --> 02:03:33,360
And I mean, I want to put it back on them too, stop saying we have blood on our hands.

2015
02:03:33,360 --> 02:03:37,480
If anybody has blood on their hands, it's the drug manufacturers putting mentally ill

2016
02:03:37,480 --> 02:03:42,840
people on stuff that's known to cause psychotic outbreaks and it's making public schools gun

2017
02:03:42,840 --> 02:03:43,840
free zones.

2018
02:03:43,840 --> 02:03:46,400
I love the NRA's new ad.

2019
02:03:46,400 --> 02:03:50,320
It's just a soft target and Wayne LaPierre hit the nail right on the head.

2020
02:03:50,320 --> 02:03:54,840
The only way to stop an evil person with a gun is a good person with a gun.

2021
02:03:54,840 --> 02:03:56,200
It's the only way it happens.

2022
02:03:56,200 --> 02:04:01,040
You look at all of these shootings that have happened as of late and it wasn't until an

2023
02:04:01,040 --> 02:04:05,840
armed citizen or a police officer stopped them.

2024
02:04:05,840 --> 02:04:06,840
Well said.

2025
02:04:06,840 --> 02:04:07,840
Period.

2026
02:04:07,840 --> 02:04:08,840
So.

2027
02:04:08,840 --> 02:04:11,120
Appreciate you, Representative.

2028
02:04:11,120 --> 02:04:15,000
Thank you so much for spending time with us and thank you for being a leader for Texas

2029
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:16,000
and America.

2030
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:17,000
We'll talk to you again soon.

2031
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:18,000
Appreciate it.

2032
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:19,000
Thanks so much.

2033
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:20,000
Thank you.

2034
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:23,000
He'll know more tomorrow, by the way, as as more of Obama's plans leak out.

2035
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:27,880
Let me tell you, that's what makes this so much worse is that they are going with a sneaky

2036
02:04:27,880 --> 02:04:29,120
angle.

2037
02:04:29,120 --> 02:04:30,140
But that's what they always do.

2038
02:04:30,140 --> 02:04:35,200
He writes the NDA, then says he's against it, then says, don't worry if it passes.

2039
02:04:35,200 --> 02:04:36,200
I'll veto it.

2040
02:04:36,200 --> 02:04:37,440
Then he doesn't veto it.

2041
02:04:37,440 --> 02:04:38,440
He signs it.

2042
02:04:38,440 --> 02:04:39,440
It turns out he wrote it.

2043
02:04:39,440 --> 02:04:42,240
That was all the plan.

2044
02:04:42,240 --> 02:04:45,720
So there's no telling what they're going to do and then they're going to get the legislation

2045
02:04:45,720 --> 02:04:49,720
written up separately and then have another mass shooting and then just sign a bunch of

2046
02:04:49,720 --> 02:04:50,800
executive orders.

2047
02:04:50,800 --> 02:04:55,280
But we've got some very important news I'll announce after the break.

2048
02:04:55,280 --> 02:04:58,560
Then we'll go to all the callers that are holding eight hundred to five at nine nine

2049

2050

2051
02:05:09,080 --> 02:05:10,760

Tyranny is here.

2065
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:09,600
The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.

2066
02:06:09,600 --> 02:06:12,280
It really says that the state is God.

2067
02:06:12,280 --> 02:06:16,800
The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most impressive police states

2068
02:06:16,800 --> 02:06:18,040
on Earth.

2069
02:06:18,040 --> 02:06:22,860
This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being

2070
02:06:22,860 --> 02:06:24,680
expanded nationwide.

2071
02:06:24,680 --> 02:06:28,840
This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all

2072
02:06:28,840 --> 02:06:30,800
powerful shadow state.

2073
02:06:30,800 --> 02:06:35,120
Police state four chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.

2074
02:06:35,120 --> 02:06:40,960
Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship, body scammers, sound cameras,

2075
02:06:40,960 --> 02:06:45,080
citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.

2076
02:06:45,080 --> 02:06:48,560
It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.

2077
02:06:48,560 --> 02:06:50,600
The police state isn't coming.

2078
02:06:50,600 --> 02:06:51,600
It's here.

leave the silver at the surface, but rather we have formulated our silver gel using the

2090
02:07:39,560 --> 02:07:44,120
natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the

2091
02:07:44,120 --> 02:07:47,840
skin while delivering the silver more effectively.

2095
02:08:05,600 --> 02:08:10,400
Big brother, mainstream media, government cover ups.

2096
02:08:10,400 --> 02:08:11,400
You want answers?

2097
02:08:11,400 --> 02:08:13,520
Well, so does he.

2098
02:08:13,520 --> 02:08:22,200
He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.

2099
02:08:22,200 --> 02:08:30,440
All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to go to your phone calls here to respond

2100
02:08:30,440 --> 02:08:32,840
to the president's nebulous announcement.

2101
02:08:32,840 --> 02:08:38,720
They have told us 23 orders and executive orders, legislation.

2102
02:08:38,720 --> 02:08:39,860
We know the plan.

2103
02:08:39,860 --> 02:08:41,760
It's Dianne Feinstein's bill.

2104
02:08:41,760 --> 02:08:47,160
It's the other ten bills that are in Congress, taxes on ammo, background checks on ammo,

2105
02:08:47,160 --> 02:08:50,200
re-gun registration, can't sell guns to anybody.

2106
02:08:50,200 --> 02:08:53,820
When you die, you've got to turn your guns in.

2107
02:08:53,820 --> 02:08:59,120
Can't transfer anything semi-auto, can't even sell it to a gun dealer.

2108
02:08:59,120 --> 02:09:03,320
Government wants to put you on a no gun buy list, no judge, no jury, you're just on it.

2109
02:09:03,320 --> 02:09:07,060
They said last week in a press conference on C-SPAN what they were gonna do.

2110
02:09:07,060 --> 02:09:12,220
The attorney general, the Chicago mob boss, Rahm Emanuel, all of them.

2111
02:09:12,220 --> 02:09:14,920
And they got up there and they laid it out.

2112
02:09:14,920 --> 02:09:18,620
And we've gone over it, but I'm gonna have my writers go back through and just say, here's

2113
02:09:18,620 --> 02:09:19,620
the plan.

2114
02:09:19,620 --> 02:09:23,120
I mean, if you had the December issue of the magazine, even before Sandy Hook, we tell

2115
02:09:23,120 --> 02:09:24,120
you the plan.

2116
02:09:24,120 --> 02:09:28,760
It's been the same plan Dianne Feinstein's had for 20 years, where she says, if I ever

2117
02:09:28,760 --> 02:09:33,000
get the votes, Mr. and Mrs. America, you're gonna turn your guns in, okay?

2118
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:35,480
And then we're like, hey, folks, Obama's gonna try to take your guns.

2119
02:09:35,480 --> 02:09:40,600
He said he'd never take any of my guns, that's a firm pledge.

2120
02:09:40,600 --> 02:09:45,480
He also pledged to not raise anybody's payroll taxes, but some of the lowest paid Americans

2121
02:09:45,480 --> 02:09:49,400
got them, 77% of tax paying Americans have their payroll tax raised.

2122
02:09:49,400 --> 02:09:53,180
He will make them $30,000 a year.

2123
02:09:53,180 --> 02:10:01,120
And it's so sad, these gullible people, because they look at you like, you're just mad cuz

2124
02:10:01,120 --> 02:10:02,700
you're not on the winning team.

2125
02:10:02,700 --> 02:10:05,520
And then meanwhile, Obama is totally chomping these people.

2126
02:10:05,520 --> 02:10:09,840
I mean, they really think, their guy got in, everything's great.

2127
02:10:09,840 --> 02:10:14,480
I've got the Washington Times here breaking down his point.

2128
02:10:14,480 --> 02:10:18,100
And it just goes over, it's basically just track everybody's guns and get them all registered

2129
02:10:18,100 --> 02:10:23,140
so they can take your guns and harass gun owners and go after everybody.

2130
02:10:23,140 --> 02:10:25,460
Also then we're going to your calls here.

2131
02:10:25,460 --> 02:10:32,640
Also we've got DHS to expand formalized coordination on gun efforts, gun control efforts.

2132
02:10:32,640 --> 02:10:37,360
So I told you, internally, they're all about getting our guns, it's not about Al-Qaeda,

2133
02:10:37,360 --> 02:10:39,840
which they use in Libya and Syria.

2134
02:10:39,840 --> 02:10:43,080
Or who they let get on the plane to come over here so they can put naked body scanners in.

2135
02:10:43,080 --> 02:10:46,720
Al-Qaeda is used to take your liberties, okay, period.

2136
02:10:46,720 --> 02:10:51,480
And DHS does one thing, they train to take on veterans and gun owners, libertarians,

2137
02:10:51,480 --> 02:10:53,600
conservatives, and rural communities.

2138
02:10:53,600 --> 02:10:58,160
They see you as the undomesticated who don't wanna be a little collectivist with them,

2139
02:10:58,160 --> 02:10:59,160
okay?

2140
02:10:59,160 --> 02:11:04,600
They want you dumbed down, on welfare, begging for an Obama phone.

2141
02:11:04,600 --> 02:11:07,240
And by the way, you want welfare, you gotta take these shots that kill you better than

2142
02:11:07,240 --> 02:11:09,240
a hammer down the road.

2143
02:11:09,240 --> 02:11:12,480
Here's the Daily Caller reporting.

2144
02:11:12,480 --> 02:11:17,000
There is now a second congressman, second GOP congressman suggests impeachment over

2145
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:19,160
executive action for gun control.

2146
02:11:19,160 --> 02:11:21,040
And see, Obama blinked.

2147
02:11:21,040 --> 02:11:23,600
He said he's gonna have executive orders and said it's for the kids.

2148
02:11:23,600 --> 02:11:27,400
That way they can just say, hey, we gotta do something, it's for the kids, aren't I

2149
02:11:27,400 --> 02:11:28,400
sweet?

2150
02:11:28,400 --> 02:11:31,440
It's for the kids, like Saddam Hussein high-fiving kids.

2151
02:11:31,440 --> 02:11:36,320
I high-five the kids, I high-five, we're gonna show you that video coming up.

2152
02:11:36,320 --> 02:11:40,280
It's on YouTube, we got it up at infoawards.com.

2153
02:11:40,280 --> 02:11:45,020
We are gonna do a great job, we high-fived.

2154
02:11:45,020 --> 02:11:49,040
And then meanwhile, well, you gotta get behind the bill, and it's a gun confiscation bill.

2155
02:11:49,040 --> 02:11:56,320
But they never even say that, knowing most of the public doesn't go and read legislation.

2156
02:11:56,320 --> 02:12:01,840
So there is all of that info, and that is exactly what we expected.

2157
02:12:01,840 --> 02:12:06,600
Now here's the announcement, and I'm going to your phone calls.

2158
02:12:06,600 --> 02:12:11,280
Something that absolutely, yeah, there it is, totally disgusting if you're a radio listener

2159
02:12:11,280 --> 02:12:16,200
and the crowd is clapping, and the kids high-five Obama.

2160
02:12:16,200 --> 02:12:21,680
He looks to the kids and he says, I'm gonna get it done for you, because you've written

2161
02:12:21,680 --> 02:12:24,100
me letters and this is what you want.

2162
02:12:24,100 --> 02:12:30,240
He wants to steal their birthright, so they live in a big mega city being raped and robbed

2163
02:12:30,240 --> 02:12:31,640
and taxed into oblivion.

2164
02:12:31,640 --> 02:12:35,600
I mean, this is the global government that does medical experiments on little kids, nerve

2165
02:12:35,600 --> 02:12:39,720
gases our own troops, injects black people with syphilis, totally ruthless, that's who's

2166
02:12:39,720 --> 02:12:40,720
hijacked the country.

2167
02:12:40,720 --> 02:12:45,400
And here's Obama, the gangster expression of it.

2168
02:12:45,400 --> 02:12:49,000
And if you don't turn your guns in, you're not for these cute little kids.

2169
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:55,000
I mean, this is the worst, most hollow, mindless exploitation meant to manipulate women, to

2170
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:57,440
get women to be anti-gun, cuz they're panicking.

2171
02:12:57,440 --> 02:13:01,380
The gun culture's taking over, women are out buying guns, crime rates are dropping.

2172
02:13:01,380 --> 02:13:05,200
They've gotta hide that and point out that school shootings are going up, while everything

2173
02:13:05,200 --> 02:13:09,480
else is going down, because they've been hyping the daylights out of it.

2174
02:13:09,480 --> 02:13:15,680
Now, here is the announcement, I don't just get up here.

2175
02:13:15,680 --> 02:13:21,120
Most websites have an IT problem, and they say we got hacked, we got this or that.

2176
02:13:21,120 --> 02:13:25,140
Years ago, somebody hacked our website and posted an image of a naked woman on a motorcycle

2177
02:13:25,140 --> 02:13:27,920
on the front page.

2178
02:13:27,920 --> 02:13:32,820
We've had plenty of denial of service attacks coming out of China, coming out of Japan,

2179
02:13:32,820 --> 02:13:37,400
but out of US military bases, they use them to basically zombie the computers to then

2180
02:13:37,400 --> 02:13:38,400
attack us.

2181
02:13:38,400 --> 02:13:41,880
We've had all sorts of attacks that go on, I don't talk about it.

2182
02:13:41,880 --> 02:13:46,560
But I've had senior cyber security people who've been in government and out of government

2183
02:13:46,560 --> 02:13:47,880
say, I don't know how you keep your side up.

2184
02:13:47,880 --> 02:13:51,400
There's been a lot of hackers out there that have also given us tips and helped us, and

2185
02:13:51,400 --> 02:13:54,520
we're eternally thankful for that.

2186
02:13:54,520 --> 02:13:57,160
We've got some great IT people.

2187
02:13:57,160 --> 02:14:04,400
But in the last two weeks, we've had two different dirty tricks done that are very sophisticated.

2188
02:14:04,400 --> 02:14:08,160
I'm not gonna get into what they did or what they exploited, but it's government level

2189
02:14:08,160 --> 02:14:10,160
type stuff.

2190
02:14:10,160 --> 02:14:15,680
And it's very sophisticated.

2191
02:14:15,680 --> 02:14:18,240
And so we've got to basically watch the site 24 hours a day now.

2192
02:14:18,240 --> 02:14:21,360
I'm having to hire more IT people just to watch 24 hours a day.

2193
02:14:21,360 --> 02:14:25,960
I'm hiring an outside consulting firm to be able to deal with this.

2194
02:14:25,960 --> 02:14:29,340
And then they went ahead to hit us with an old fashioned denial of service attack.

2195
02:14:29,340 --> 02:14:32,960
It's undoubtedly, we are getting a lot of traffic today.

2196
02:14:32,960 --> 02:14:35,440
And traffic's much higher than it's ever been.

2197
02:14:35,440 --> 02:14:39,080
But we were thinking early on, this is an all time record traffic, which it pretty much

2198
02:14:39,080 --> 02:14:41,560
would be, or almost a record.

2199
02:14:41,560 --> 02:14:45,280
But we can see, and they've got graphs in there, like I want them to get shots, that's

2200
02:14:45,280 --> 02:14:50,840
a new report, cuz this is newsworthy, showing that it's denial of service from a whole bunch

2201
02:14:50,840 --> 02:14:56,280
of zombie computers, government computers, hijacked university computers, you name it.

2202
02:14:56,280 --> 02:15:02,080
The minute Obama started speaking today, about five minutes before he did when Joe Biden

2203
02:15:02,080 --> 02:15:06,480
was up there is when this started, the site is up right now for now.

2204
02:15:06,480 --> 02:15:11,520
And it appears they're very upset about the move to impeach Obama.

2205
02:15:11,520 --> 02:15:16,120
And I mean, listen, the globalists kill and assassinate people all over the world.

2206
02:15:16,120 --> 02:15:18,920
I am ready for them to kill me, okay?

2207
02:15:18,920 --> 02:15:22,560
And I don't think it's gonna happen because I'm so outspoken, and my grandma's praying

2208
02:15:22,560 --> 02:15:25,760
real hard for me, and I don't wanna die.

2209
02:15:25,760 --> 02:15:33,680
I'll never commit suicide, but I mean, seriously, I've not made a big deal over the years about

2210
02:15:33,680 --> 02:15:36,960
some of the other stuff that's going on, because it just sounds like a movie, and people aren't

2211
02:15:36,960 --> 02:15:37,960
gonna believe it.

2212
02:15:37,960 --> 02:15:41,720
Now, other media people I've talked to, they're like, no, I know that's happened to me or

2213
02:15:41,720 --> 02:15:42,720
that's happened to people I know.

2214
02:15:42,720 --> 02:15:46,680
A lot of folks get intimidated like this and they just go away.

2215
02:15:46,680 --> 02:15:48,880
All I know how to do is fight harder.

2216
02:15:48,880 --> 02:15:53,560
I get death threats, I start doing videos at 2 AM, I mean, I start working 18, 20 hours

2217
02:15:53,560 --> 02:15:54,560
a day.

2218
02:15:54,560 --> 02:16:02,500
I'm like, wow, these people really are criminals, I better do something, I better work harder.

2219
02:16:02,500 --> 02:16:06,240
And it's my upbringing, it's my instincts, it's just who I am.

2220
02:16:06,240 --> 02:16:10,260
I mean, I'm not bragging about it, I'm proud of my ancestors, though they were all the

2221
02:16:10,260 --> 02:16:11,640
same way I am.

2222
02:16:11,640 --> 02:16:17,560
I mean, I'm probably like some of the more extreme examples, but the point is, it doesn't

2223
02:16:17,560 --> 02:16:18,560
intimidate me.

2224
02:16:18,560 --> 02:16:21,240
I mean, I am not afraid.

2225
02:16:21,240 --> 02:16:27,360
I'm afraid of being a buffoon, I'm afraid of stumbling over things, I'm afraid of getting

2226
02:16:27,360 --> 02:16:28,360
things wrong.

2227
02:16:28,360 --> 02:16:32,480
I'm afraid of overworking and getting tired and not doing a good job.

2228
02:16:32,480 --> 02:16:37,640
I'm afraid to look at myself in the mirror, I mean, I'm just doing the best I can, and

2229
02:16:37,640 --> 02:16:38,960
that resonates with people.

2230
02:16:38,960 --> 02:16:46,040
For all my warts, was it Lord Wellington, no, it was Lord Nelson said, you've gotta

2231
02:16:46,040 --> 02:16:47,680
take me, warts and all.

2232
02:16:47,680 --> 02:16:51,720
I know people are resonating with the fact that I'm real.

2233
02:16:51,720 --> 02:16:57,200
And I just want you to know, this is the big thing we're doing, and they are upset.

2234
02:16:57,200 --> 02:17:03,120
Look, when they death threat us or they do sophisticated hacks, even against third parties

2235
02:17:03,120 --> 02:17:09,400
to try to get into our system, when they call up and tell my wife or myself what we were

2236
02:17:09,400 --> 02:17:18,640
just talking about on the phone to freak us out, like a movie, that just confirms everything,

2237
02:17:18,640 --> 02:17:20,640
okay?

2238
02:17:20,640 --> 02:17:24,760
And these people are criminals, and the reason they are doing denial of service attacks,

2239
02:17:24,760 --> 02:17:31,280
the reason they are doing very complex governmental exploits, developed by French companies and

2240
02:17:31,280 --> 02:17:34,800
others that openly only sell to governments.

2241
02:17:34,800 --> 02:17:39,800
The fact that these are institutional attacks we're having against mfallwars.com, and whenever

2242
02:17:39,800 --> 02:17:42,800
that site's having problems, you can go to prisonplanet.com.

2243
02:17:42,800 --> 02:17:47,360
But make no mistake, what's happening right now is historical.

2244
02:17:47,360 --> 02:17:51,580
And a lot of people joke and say, you're the only one dumb enough to get in this system's

2245
02:17:51,580 --> 02:17:52,580
face like this.

2246
02:17:52,580 --> 02:17:58,040
No, no, no, let it in, I mean, sometimes when I've been death threaded or messages

2247
02:17:58,040 --> 02:18:01,200
are related, it's like, look, do you understand we can kill you?

2248
02:18:01,200 --> 02:18:03,720
What you just think, I've been doing all this and I didn't know that?

2249
02:18:03,720 --> 02:18:08,540
You think I'm like you, New World Order, most of you guys, go join the evil because you

2250
02:18:08,540 --> 02:18:09,800
think it's the winning team.

2251
02:18:09,800 --> 02:18:13,240
I cannot join you, okay?

2252
02:18:13,240 --> 02:18:19,040
It's not even a question of, not comparing myself to one of the prophets, but things

2253
02:18:19,040 --> 02:18:20,240
historically like this.

2254
02:18:20,240 --> 02:18:23,320
Ezekiel, they're threatening to kill him cuz he's getting in the corrupt's faces.

2255
02:18:23,320 --> 02:18:28,860
And he says to God, he goes, God, they're gonna kill me if I keep getting in their faces,

2256
02:18:28,860 --> 02:18:32,000
but it's burning in my bones, I think that was Ezekiel.

2257
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:35,760
And that's what it's like, I am not in control of myself, okay?

2258
02:18:35,760 --> 02:18:41,520
I want everybody to understand that I cannot give up, I cannot give in, I cannot stop,

2259
02:18:41,520 --> 02:18:42,520
okay?

2260
02:18:42,520 --> 02:18:50,000
It is a overriding drive, and it may be ugly sometimes, but it's the best I can do, okay?

2261
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:51,120
And that's it.

2262
02:18:51,120 --> 02:18:57,000
But these fools think that dirty tricks, death threats, denial of service attacks, sophisticated

2263
02:18:57,000 --> 02:19:02,900
hacks, all sorts of other crud, cognitive infiltration, COINTELPRO stuff's gonna get

2264
02:19:02,900 --> 02:19:06,480
to me, saying where I live and saying come kill me.

2265
02:19:06,480 --> 02:19:10,880
All this kinda crap on the news saying, I hope his kids don't get killed, I think we

2266
02:19:10,880 --> 02:19:14,520
should kill him, yeah, we'll do it in a uniform, ha ha ha ha.

2267
02:19:14,520 --> 02:19:22,080
Look, I know you're a bunch of Jerry Sandusky, Jimmy Savelle wannabes, okay?

2268
02:19:22,080 --> 02:19:25,840
And look, I'm not ever going to bow to you, you understand that?

2269
02:19:25,840 --> 02:19:30,780
I'm never gonna shut up, I'm never gonna back down, I'm never gonna stop.

2270
02:19:30,780 --> 02:19:35,560
And all my critics, hey, I know it's ugly sometimes, it is what it is, okay?

2271
02:19:35,560 --> 02:19:41,400
I'm in the arena, and I'm in the arena with people like State Representative Koth.

2272
02:19:41,400 --> 02:19:45,680
I'm in the arena with people like Ron Paul, I'm in the arena with people like Matt Drudge,

2273
02:19:45,680 --> 02:19:48,800
I'm in the arena with people like you that want liberty.

2274
02:19:48,800 --> 02:19:56,200
I'm never backing down, I signed my John Hancock on the Declaration of Independence 2012, and

2275
02:19:56,200 --> 02:20:00,920
I'm never backing down, never giving in.

2276
02:20:00,920 --> 02:20:04,680
If you've ever wanted one of our best selling generators, but were waiting for an offer

2277
02:20:04,680 --> 02:20:09,640
so crazy you couldn't refuse, then you're not gonna wanna miss this exciting message.

2278
02:20:09,640 --> 02:20:10,640
Here's why.

2279
02:20:10,640 --> 02:20:15,960
Solar generators provide life-saving electrical power, and unlike gas generators, solar generators

2280
02:20:15,960 --> 02:20:20,360
run quietly, emit no fumes, and produce electricity from the sun.

2281
02:20:20,360 --> 02:20:23,720
So when the lights go out, you'll always have the power you need.

2282
02:20:23,720 --> 02:20:25,400
Now here's the best part.

2283
02:20:25,400 --> 02:20:30,080
Every year we accumulate a few solar generators that we just can't sell as new.

2284
02:20:30,080 --> 02:20:35,260
We put them in a special spot in our warehouse, and we discount them heavily at the end of

2285
02:20:35,260 --> 02:20:36,260
each year.

2286
02:20:36,260 --> 02:20:40,000
We call them scratch and dent units, but they're really just like new.

2287
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:45,200
Each unit comes with a full factory warranty, and special bonuses you just won't believe.

2288
02:20:45,200 --> 02:20:46,760
Don't wait, they go fast.

2289
02:20:46,760 --> 02:20:50,640
Go to scratchanddentsolar.com, that's scratchanddentsolar.com.

2290
02:20:50,640 --> 02:20:57,200
For the craziest offer we've ever made, go to scratchanddentsolar.com, that's scratchanddentsolar.com.

2291
02:20:57,200 --> 02:21:07,880
You land in Buenos Aires, then a shuttle to Santa Rosa, where a nicely furnished cabin

2292
02:21:07,880 --> 02:21:13,720
with all amenities, Wi-Fi, executive food and wine, and laundry service awaits.

2293
02:21:13,720 --> 02:21:16,920
After a good night's sleep, your adventure begins.

2294
02:21:16,920 --> 02:21:24,600
You're on a golden stag safari for big game, but it's not Africa, it's Argentina.

2295
02:21:24,600 --> 02:21:30,880
One-on-one guided hunts for water buffalo, huger, bighorn rams, wild boar, and the biggest

2296
02:21:30,880 --> 02:21:33,280
stag deer in South America.

2297
02:21:33,280 --> 02:21:38,560
All gold medal quality, all the action you can handle.

2298
02:21:38,560 --> 02:21:43,920
Land rovers, top rental guns with scopes, all food, beverages, hunting guides, ground

2299
02:21:43,920 --> 02:21:49,420
transportation included, and more, all more affordable than you can imagine.

2300
02:21:49,420 --> 02:22:00,200
The adventure of a lifetime starts at goldenstagsafaris.com, the big game hunting ranch, goldenstagsafaris.com.

2301
02:22:00,200 --> 02:22:03,080
Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors.

2302
02:22:03,080 --> 02:22:07,080
Are we going to see economic growth, slide into a recession, or at worst, depression?

2303
02:22:07,080 --> 02:22:09,520
Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.

2304
02:22:09,520 --> 02:22:13,800
We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety

2305
02:22:13,800 --> 02:22:14,800
is prudent.

2306
02:22:14,800 --> 02:22:18,080
When the market becomes volatile, U.S. treasuries are a safe haven.

2307
02:22:18,080 --> 02:22:23,000
But what do you do when the U.S. government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?

2308
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:26,840
Many investors are turning toward gold as a common sense alternative to traditional

2309
02:22:26,840 --> 02:22:28,240
paper investments.

2310
02:22:28,240 --> 02:22:32,760
Midas Resources has put together a powerful book titled Ten Reasons to Own Gold, discussing

2311
02:22:32,760 --> 02:22:37,600
costs, benefits, risks, featuring full-color illustrations, weights, and measures.

2317
02:22:57,240 --> 02:23:03,640
Feeling like there are too many pressures and demands on you?

2318
02:23:03,640 --> 02:23:07,400
Losing sleep, worrying about tests and schoolwork, leaving you on the run because your schedule

2319
02:23:07,400 --> 02:23:09,520
is just too busy?

2320
02:23:09,520 --> 02:23:13,560

2329
02:23:56,880 --> 02:24:16,040
Okay, you guys have been holding long enough, I appreciate you holding.

2330
02:24:16,040 --> 02:24:22,680
I just can't believe that so many people are fundamentally scared of this criminal government

2331
02:24:22,680 --> 02:24:29,560
so then the criminal government wins and takes over.

2332
02:24:29,560 --> 02:24:31,680
Because we act like sheep, they then win.

2333
02:24:31,680 --> 02:24:35,640
Instead of acting like men, America is in a trance, man.

2334
02:24:35,640 --> 02:24:38,960
Even people that know what's going on, you talk to them, you can't get through to them.

2335
02:24:38,960 --> 02:24:43,560
It's television watching has turned people into jellyfish.

2336
02:24:43,560 --> 02:24:44,920
Let's go to George in Texas.

2337
02:24:44,920 --> 02:24:47,560
George, you're on the air, go ahead.

2338
02:24:47,560 --> 02:24:49,760
Thank you, Alex, for taking my call.

2339
02:24:49,760 --> 02:24:53,560
I know there's been a buzz going around the Internet saying January 19th is going to be

2340
02:24:53,560 --> 02:24:55,920
Gun Appreciation Day.

2341
02:24:55,920 --> 02:25:01,760
I'm calling on the audience, let's have a Gun Owners of America membership bomb to send

2342
02:25:01,760 --> 02:25:04,640
the message that we're not throwing down our weapons.

2343
02:25:04,640 --> 02:25:09,360
I agree, I mean, I've said I'm not turning my guns in, I'm done.

2344
02:25:09,360 --> 02:25:10,360
That's why I'm so upset.

2345
02:25:10,360 --> 02:25:16,120
I've got to sit here as a law abiding person and tell the criminal government, who's exploiting

2346
02:25:16,120 --> 02:25:21,200
dead children, you're not getting my semi-automatic rifles, you had incredible draconian gun laws

2347
02:25:21,200 --> 02:25:23,020
in Connecticut and this happened.

2348
02:25:23,020 --> 02:25:26,640
They probably staged it, they staged Fast and Furious.

2349
02:25:26,640 --> 02:25:27,640
That's why I get so angry.

2350
02:25:27,640 --> 02:25:34,000
Well, I'm just saying Larry Pratt has been on the fight for a long time, even when public

2351
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:35,200
opinion was against him.

2352
02:25:35,200 --> 02:25:38,280
He has held his ground and I think he needs our support.

2353
02:25:38,280 --> 02:25:41,920
So I'm saying January 19th, $20 a year membership bomb.

2354
02:25:41,920 --> 02:25:47,060
Well, I agree, they've gotten a quarter million new members in the last month with the NRA.

2355
02:25:47,060 --> 02:25:50,680
And the NRA got real milquetoast for a while because they were being infiltrated.

2356
02:25:50,680 --> 02:25:53,000
We put pressure on them, they've gotten a lot better.

2357
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:56,840
But yeah, Gun Owners of America, I mean, I need to ask Larry, they've gotten a lot of

2358
02:25:56,840 --> 02:26:00,160
new members, but they should have gotten a quarter million new members.

2359
02:26:00,160 --> 02:26:04,520
And we have NRA board members on and stuff like Bob Barr and stuff, I'm not knocking

2360
02:26:04,520 --> 02:26:05,520
them.

2361
02:26:05,520 --> 02:26:06,640
I mean, overall, they're getting better.

2362
02:26:06,640 --> 02:26:10,820
It's just that they used to, they supported the 68 Gun Control Act that got us into this

2363
02:26:10,820 --> 02:26:12,120
mess to begin with.

2364
02:26:12,120 --> 02:26:13,120
Thank you so much, George.

2365
02:26:13,120 --> 02:26:14,120
Good point.

2366
02:26:14,120 --> 02:26:16,120
Bill in North Carolina, you're on the air.

2367
02:26:16,120 --> 02:26:18,440
Hey, Alex, thank you for taking my call.

2368
02:26:18,440 --> 02:26:19,440
Can you hear me?

2369
02:26:19,440 --> 02:26:20,440
Yes, I can.

2370
02:26:20,440 --> 02:26:23,960
Alex, first off, I pray for you every day.

2371
02:26:23,960 --> 02:26:25,200
I love what you're doing.

2372
02:26:25,200 --> 02:26:26,600
You've been incredible.

2373
02:26:26,600 --> 02:26:30,800
And the night you went on Piers Morgan, I think that woke a lot of people up.

2374
02:26:30,800 --> 02:26:33,000
And I just wanna make a quick point today.

2375
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:37,160
Recently I moved from one town in North Carolina to right outside Camp Lejeune.

2376
02:26:37,160 --> 02:26:41,880
And when I got here, I thought the young Marines were gonna be just sheep.

2377
02:26:41,880 --> 02:26:48,160
And when I found out, the 19-year-olds, the 20s, the 28-year-olds, they know what's going

2378
02:26:48,160 --> 02:26:49,160
on.

2379
02:26:49,160 --> 02:26:52,640
They knew about Benghazi, they knew about Fast and Furious, they knew about the discrepancies

2380
02:26:52,640 --> 02:26:55,520
in Sandy Hook, and they're gonna stand down.

2381
02:26:55,520 --> 02:26:59,520
The ones I'm talking with, if they go in, they get told to confiscate, they're either

2382
02:26:59,520 --> 02:27:03,720
gonna stand down, they're gonna pull out of rank, or they're not gonna show up for work.

2383
02:27:03,720 --> 02:27:07,700
So I think one of the ways people can get on the offense is talk to your people, call

2384
02:27:07,700 --> 02:27:11,920
your local sheriffs like I do, ask their opinion, find out what they're doing.

2385
02:27:11,920 --> 02:27:17,280
Call Congressman Stockton, thank him, call Sheriff Merrill, because those guys need the

2386
02:27:17,280 --> 02:27:21,400
prayers and they need people to support them because they're going out on a limb.

2387
02:27:21,400 --> 02:27:26,640
And we need those guys to be a light out in the open for other representatives and other

2388
02:27:26,640 --> 02:27:30,000
people in our legal system and sheriffs to follow.

2389
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:34,440
Absolutely, I wanna get both these sheriffs, one in Kentucky, one in Washington State on,

2390
02:27:34,440 --> 02:27:37,240
one of them wrote a letter just saying, look, what you're doing is unconstitutional, I'm

2391
02:27:37,240 --> 02:27:38,760
not gonna be part of it.

2392
02:27:38,760 --> 02:27:43,400
And it's gotta get to that point, but all this unconstitutional stuff, it's all out

2393
02:27:43,400 --> 02:27:45,240
of control.

2394
02:27:45,240 --> 02:27:51,780
And again, when I found that the FBI statistics from the locals was 21% reduction in violent

2395
02:27:51,780 --> 02:27:58,240
crime generally, 49 in crimes with guns, that is the most powerful statistic.

2396
02:27:58,240 --> 02:28:01,200
And again, I've criticized Fox News in the past, but they were showing the statistic

2397
02:28:01,200 --> 02:28:05,600
last weekend, or late last week, and I went and looked it up and it was a statistic I

2398
02:28:05,600 --> 02:28:07,240
hadn't seen or heard.

2399
02:28:07,240 --> 02:28:15,920
And it was compiled from local governments, 49% drop in gun crime, 49%, I mean, and they

2400
02:28:15,920 --> 02:28:20,240
want our guns and are parading and high-fying and going, you're beautiful children, the

2401
02:28:20,240 --> 02:28:25,480
families here, you lost your beautiful children, like a vampire using the deaths of those kids.

2402
02:28:25,480 --> 02:28:28,760
I mean, did it make you nauseated to watch that press conference?

2403
02:28:28,760 --> 02:28:34,200
Alex, disgusting, I was sitting here chomping at the bit, I'm listening to and to exploit

2404
02:28:34,200 --> 02:28:40,240
those children, it's a psyop, it's disgusting, because we know, those of us who are awake

2405
02:28:40,240 --> 02:28:46,240
and those of us who have prior military experience know exactly what he's doing and why he's

2406
02:28:46,240 --> 02:28:50,040
doing it, and it's just disgusting to watch.

2407
02:28:50,040 --> 02:28:54,800
And one other thing too that I'm seeing too is the hypocrisy, a lot of times when I'm

2408
02:28:54,800 --> 02:28:58,920
talking to the liberals out there, it's a matter of their opinion, it's like, look guys,

2409
02:28:58,920 --> 02:29:03,360
it's not about your opinion, these are the impeachable offenses, you're Benghazi, you're

2410
02:29:03,360 --> 02:29:07,560
Fast and Furious, you're Sandy Hooks, so what you were able to put down in those article

2411
02:29:07,560 --> 02:29:11,960
impeachments, I'm able to get out to Facebook and share that with my friends and family

2412
02:29:11,960 --> 02:29:17,440
because it's not a matter of opinion, it's a matter of constitutional doctrine.

2413
02:29:17,440 --> 02:29:22,560
So keep it up, Alex, I love you, I pray for you and your staff, my brother, keep on keeping

2414
02:29:22,560 --> 02:29:23,560
on, brother.

2415
02:29:23,560 --> 02:29:30,520
Thank you, my friend as well, and again folks, if they were real dummies that wanted guns

2416
02:29:30,520 --> 02:29:36,960
to keep us safe, it wouldn't be as bad, these are mobster gangster crooks that suckered

2417
02:29:36,960 --> 02:29:41,480
their own people and said we're not going to raise your taxes and then massively hammered

2418
02:29:41,480 --> 02:29:46,240
them, and then almost all the working poor are going down to 29 hours from 40 or 50,

2419
02:29:46,240 --> 02:29:50,280
I mean, it's so mean.

2420
02:29:50,280 --> 02:30:01,760

convincing and that's Dreams from My Real Father by Joel Gilbert, available at Infowars.com.

These titles and a lot more are all available at Infowarshop.com.

2444
02:32:01,320 --> 02:32:06,160
Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive from natural disasters

2445
02:32:06,160 --> 02:32:10,760
like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on

2446
02:32:10,760 --> 02:32:12,600
by a disastrous economy?

2447
02:32:12,600 --> 02:32:15,320
Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything.

2448
02:32:15,320 --> 02:32:19,120
At E Foods Direct, we hear from customers every day that are fortunate enough to weather

life's storm by having a supply of food on hand.

2450
02:32:22,040 --> 02:32:26,600
After Hurricane Sandy, Danny from New York City wrote, almost all the grocery stores

2451
02:32:26,600 --> 02:32:31,440
are closed, but I managed to get my E Foods just in time to be able to help my sister

2452
02:32:31,440 --> 02:32:32,440
and niece.

2453
02:32:32,440 --> 02:32:36,240
It is better to be prepared 10 years too early than one day too late.

2454
02:32:36,240 --> 02:32:38,480

2460
02:33:09,760 --> 02:33:14,480
From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.

2461
02:33:14,480 --> 02:33:35,960
It is really hard to do this radio show because really what I want to be doing is going back

2462
02:33:35,960 --> 02:33:39,920
and getting all their statements and video clips and press conferences where they say

2463
02:33:39,920 --> 02:33:40,920
what their plan is.

2464
02:33:40,920 --> 02:33:45,560
And then I can show you, I say 11 or 12 bills, it's like 20 something now they've introduced

2465
02:33:45,560 --> 02:33:49,820
in Congress, but they're all incredibly nasty.

2466
02:33:49,820 --> 02:33:52,920
And so no one even knows what the plan is now.

2467
02:33:52,920 --> 02:33:57,960
It's just, hey, I'm up here with kids high-fying, any more kids get killed, it's you gun owners,

2468
02:33:57,960 --> 02:34:02,320
it's your fault if you don't do what I want, I'm the good guy.

2469
02:34:02,320 --> 02:34:04,160
And it's just such a mindless psyop.

2470
02:34:04,160 --> 02:34:08,520
It's like saying, turn your cars in or the next time there's a car wreck, it's your fault.

2471
02:34:08,520 --> 02:34:12,080
I mean, it is just, yeah, let's get some audio while he's high-fying.

2472
02:34:12,080 --> 02:34:18,040
I mean, exploiting those little sweetie pies, man, I tell you, people used to show me photos

2473
02:34:18,040 --> 02:34:21,440
of their kids when I was young and I'd be like, why are you showing me photos of your

2474
02:34:21,440 --> 02:34:22,440
kids?

2475
02:34:22,440 --> 02:34:25,360
Now I've got children, people want to show me their wallet full of pictures, I want to

2476
02:34:25,360 --> 02:34:26,360
see it.

2477
02:34:26,360 --> 02:34:27,360
You know what I mean?

2478
02:34:27,360 --> 02:34:31,280
I just, it makes me sick whenever people use kids for something.

2479
02:34:31,280 --> 02:34:37,520
I just love children so much because their little minds ready to be filled with information

2480
02:34:37,520 --> 02:34:39,560
and for the adventure of life.

2481
02:34:39,560 --> 02:34:45,400
And then I think of people like Sandusky and Saville and these globalist scum and the things

2482
02:34:45,400 --> 02:34:49,480
they do to children and it makes me sick.

2483
02:34:49,480 --> 02:34:54,320
It makes me sick, it's like people that want to hurt innocent animals like dogs and cats.

2484
02:34:54,320 --> 02:34:57,820
I mean, you read about people that it's like some fetish where good looking women beat

2485
02:34:57,820 --> 02:35:00,280
animals to death, some kind of snuff porn.

2486
02:35:00,280 --> 02:35:06,920
I mean, it's little puppies, kids, but kids, it's like 10 times more angering than puppies.

2487
02:35:06,920 --> 02:35:08,720
It's like, who are these people?

2488
02:35:08,720 --> 02:35:14,800
And they're always, these perverts and pedophiles and government types are always real fake

2489
02:35:14,800 --> 02:35:19,920
and psychopathic and come off like nice guys, but you can see it in their eyes and in their

2490
02:35:19,920 --> 02:35:20,980
actions.

2491
02:35:20,980 --> 02:35:25,560
And when Obama talks about those beautiful children that got killed, they always call

2492
02:35:25,560 --> 02:35:26,560
them beautiful.

2493
02:35:26,560 --> 02:35:31,120
I mean, what a pervert, man, okay, I'm going too far what I really think about Obama.

2494
02:35:31,120 --> 02:35:34,400
That guy is a demonic pervert.

2495
02:35:34,400 --> 02:35:37,920
He wants to pervert our Constitution, he wants to pervert our republic.

2496
02:35:37,920 --> 02:35:41,880
He wants to be a Peace Prize winner and launch all these illegal wars.

2497
02:35:41,880 --> 02:35:46,800
And the left is just all sick and gets into the death and destruction and all of it.

2498
02:35:46,800 --> 02:35:52,320
I mean, I'm just sick of them.

2499
02:35:52,320 --> 02:35:57,120
And Joe Biden is such a gangster.

2500
02:35:57,120 --> 02:36:01,000
And Rahm Emanuel looks like a cartoon character gangster.

2501
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:06,040
I mean, did you see him in that press conference yesterday, sweating and looking all nuts?

2502
02:36:06,040 --> 02:36:10,640
I mean, that guy is crazy.

2503
02:36:10,640 --> 02:36:14,480
And you've got all these like San Francisco and New York saying how big your Coca-Cola

2504
02:36:14,480 --> 02:36:17,720
can be, how big your apartment can be now.

2505
02:36:17,720 --> 02:36:22,240
I mean, just a bunch of control freaks, they just wanna run everybody's lives.

2506
02:36:22,240 --> 02:36:27,160
They want everybody living in fear, not need of stuff that statistically isn't a threat.

2507
02:36:27,160 --> 02:36:31,480
If my kids went to public school, I'd be worried about them being beat up by bullies, turning

2508
02:36:31,480 --> 02:36:37,560
into mindless TV heads, turning into emotional wrecks cuz a bunch of mean kids telling them

2509
02:36:37,560 --> 02:36:44,000
they're not cool, instead of their minds being filled with science and sports and discovery.

2510
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:46,400
I'd be scared of the state pushing drugs on them.

2511
02:36:46,400 --> 02:36:48,600
I'd be scared of stuff like that.

2512
02:36:48,600 --> 02:36:53,080
I wouldn't be scared if my kids went to public school of a mass shooting.

2513
02:36:53,080 --> 02:36:59,200
88 people die a year, and last year was a record year.

2514
02:36:59,200 --> 02:37:03,080
All the other crimes dropping but those, cuz the media advertises it, of a Sikh temple,

2515
02:37:03,080 --> 02:37:09,320
a movie theater, a couple schools, 88 people dead.

2516
02:37:09,320 --> 02:37:14,880
I mean, ladies and gentlemen, that doesn't even register in the top 100 causes of death.

2517
02:37:14,880 --> 02:37:19,240
But they've got people thinking, I mean, I got news reports pouring out where people

2518
02:37:19,240 --> 02:37:22,840
see a kid with a Nerf gun in their front yard that sold at Target and Walmart.

2519
02:37:22,840 --> 02:37:26,360
My kids have probably had ten of them over the years cuz they break so easy, and we were

2520
02:37:26,360 --> 02:37:27,360
having a Nerf battle this weekend.

2521
02:37:27,360 --> 02:37:31,080
I mean, you drive through any suburban neighborhood, it's Nerf war.

2522
02:37:31,080 --> 02:37:33,860
Your car gets shot with Nerf darts.

2523
02:37:33,860 --> 02:37:35,360
Your car gets hit with footballs.

2524
02:37:35,360 --> 02:37:41,920
I mean, people now see orange and yellow and green Nerf guns, and the police are called

2525
02:37:41,920 --> 02:37:44,880
and they lock down the area and play along with it.

2526
02:37:44,880 --> 02:37:51,520
I mean, it is just sick how they are turning us into a bunch of cowards.

2527
02:37:51,520 --> 02:37:55,080
And believe me, everything Obama said in that press conference is a target.

2528
02:37:55,080 --> 02:37:57,720
There it is, Nerf gun found after Long Island school lockdown.

2529
02:37:57,720 --> 02:38:00,960
I mean, there's a bunch of these happening.

2530
02:38:00,960 --> 02:38:05,040
That whole speech was targeting shocker moms about, here's the sweet kids, we don't want

2531
02:38:05,040 --> 02:38:06,120
them to get killed.

2532
02:38:06,120 --> 02:38:11,440
I got some reasonable stuff I'm gonna be announcing, goodbye, goodbye, high five, high five.

2533
02:38:11,440 --> 02:38:16,320
I got an Obamacare, there's no death panels, no, it doesn't increase your premiums.

2534
02:38:16,320 --> 02:38:20,800
That's a right wing lie, blah, blah, more like, here it is, here it is.

2535
02:38:20,800 --> 02:38:21,800
It's in a bill.

2536
02:38:21,800 --> 02:38:24,320
But see, they never say it in press conferences.

2537
02:38:24,320 --> 02:38:29,840
So I have to sit here, that's why I'm getting so angry, is this is like Groundhog Day.

2538
02:38:29,840 --> 02:38:38,800
You ever seen that great movie, Groundhog Day, with Bill Murray?

2539
02:38:38,800 --> 02:38:43,520
And he just, I mean, it's the same day over and over again.

2540
02:38:43,520 --> 02:38:46,040
No matter what he does, he has to relive this day over and over again.

2541
02:38:46,040 --> 02:38:53,000
And I have to watch people get conned and bamboozled and manipulated and snookered and

2542
02:38:53,000 --> 02:38:55,000
conned over and over and over again.

2543
02:38:55,000 --> 02:38:58,320
And I know exactly what they're doing, and I'm not even smart.

2544
02:38:58,320 --> 02:39:02,200
I mean, that was an incredibly exploitive press conference.

2545
02:39:02,200 --> 02:39:10,120
Biden was trying to hold back a smile the entire time, was literally having a you know

2546
02:39:10,120 --> 02:39:12,280
what dream up there.

2547
02:39:12,280 --> 02:39:16,200
Obama was trying to act somber and look like the devil.

2548
02:39:16,200 --> 02:39:21,160
All right, I'm gonna stop.

2549
02:39:21,160 --> 02:39:23,240
Andy in Africa, I didn't know somebody was calling from Africa.

2550
02:39:23,240 --> 02:39:26,080
Where are you calling us from Africa?

2551
02:39:26,080 --> 02:39:28,040
I'm calling from Africa, Alex.

2552
02:39:28,040 --> 02:39:29,400
Welcome, you're on the air.

2553
02:39:29,400 --> 02:39:32,720
Where are you calling from in Africa?

2554
02:39:32,720 --> 02:39:35,400
The good part, the southern part.

2555
02:39:35,400 --> 02:39:36,400
South Africa?

2556
02:39:36,400 --> 02:39:39,080
That's it, that's right, Alex.

2557
02:39:39,080 --> 02:39:42,700
To start out, I just wanna say thanks for making people aware of some of the really

2558
02:39:42,700 --> 02:39:44,440
important issues like gun control.

2559
02:39:44,440 --> 02:39:48,160
I really like how you've upgraded the show, and hello to all the listeners out there.

2560
02:39:48,160 --> 02:39:50,040
May Yahushua bless you all.

2561
02:39:50,040 --> 02:39:51,240
Well, thank you.

2562
02:39:51,240 --> 02:39:53,160
How do we upgrade the show?

2563
02:39:53,160 --> 02:39:56,800
Okay, no, just the new graphics and the TV.

2564
02:39:56,800 --> 02:40:00,440
I've watched your show for about, I've seen your show, I wouldn't listen to it for about

2565
02:40:00,440 --> 02:40:01,920
five, six, seven years now.

2566
02:40:01,920 --> 02:40:02,920
So it's looking good.

2567
02:40:02,920 --> 02:40:08,400
We're gonna keep upgrading, but I gotta say, CJ and Chris are just upping their game.

2568
02:40:08,400 --> 02:40:13,720
John Bound, the hardest place to work is in here with me, cuz I get in a rampage, and

2569
02:40:13,720 --> 02:40:15,080
so I pray for them as well.

2570
02:40:15,080 --> 02:40:16,520
They're doing overall a great job.

2571
02:40:16,520 --> 02:40:18,680
They really upped their game, so we're thankful for that.

2572
02:40:18,680 --> 02:40:20,400
Go ahead, sir, I'll shut up.

2573
02:40:20,400 --> 02:40:22,240
No worries, no worries, no worries.

2574
02:40:22,240 --> 02:40:24,520
You mentioned your web servers have been going down.

2575
02:40:24,520 --> 02:40:26,760
Well, you're not the only one, so to speak.

2576
02:40:26,760 --> 02:40:31,520
I am a web developer and researcher, and I'm here to tell you that the Illuminati is back

2577
02:40:31,520 --> 02:40:32,520
online.

2578
02:40:32,520 --> 02:40:33,520
Breaking news.

2579
02:40:33,520 --> 02:40:35,940
Now, what do I mean by that?

2580
02:40:35,940 --> 02:40:39,320
You remember the Illuminati card game, right?

2581
02:40:39,320 --> 02:40:40,320
Yes.

2582
02:40:40,320 --> 02:40:46,160
Okay, interesting thing is this card game started out as an online game, okay?

2583
02:40:46,160 --> 02:40:51,520
Running on what we would call an Illuminati server, I guess, which was a DDS system.

2584
02:40:51,520 --> 02:40:56,600
So the game started on a server, and then Steve Jackson's games was raided by the Secret

2585
02:40:56,600 --> 02:41:01,040
Service, and they confiscated the server and the data that was on that server.

2586
02:41:01,040 --> 02:41:05,520
The game was never supposed to get out, according to Stephen Dolan's said to be an ex-Satanist

2587
02:41:05,520 --> 02:41:07,840
anti-priest, who exposed the game in the Prophets of God.

2588
02:41:07,840 --> 02:41:13,440
By the way, the maker of the Illuminati card game and the video game developer, he has

2589
02:41:13,440 --> 02:41:16,000
his offices about two miles from us.

2590
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:19,080
We've called him, no exaggeration, probably 40 times.

2591
02:41:19,080 --> 02:41:22,920
I keep saying when we get time, we're gonna go over there.

2592
02:41:22,920 --> 02:41:26,760
And also, in the past, I know where he lived, cuz my parents lived close to him in North

2593
02:41:26,760 --> 02:41:30,280
Austin, and he'd have these weird Halloween parties where he'd let all the neighborhood

2594
02:41:30,280 --> 02:41:32,240
kids in, run through his castle house.

2595
02:41:32,240 --> 02:41:34,800
I never went over there, but I read about it in the paper.

2596
02:41:34,800 --> 02:41:39,560
Back when I was in high school, actually, we're talking about like in 1992, yeah, his

2597
02:41:39,560 --> 02:41:41,800
card game predicts everything.

2598
02:41:41,800 --> 02:41:43,600
And I don't know how they did it.

2599
02:41:43,600 --> 02:41:44,600
It's bizarre.

2600
02:41:44,600 --> 02:41:49,720
Well, that's pretty interesting, cuz possibly Stephen Dolan's had insider knowledge being

2601
02:41:49,720 --> 02:41:50,720
a Satanist anti-priest.

2602
02:41:50,720 --> 02:41:55,520
So anyhow, Steve Jackson's games, this is where it gets really interesting, Alex.

2603
02:41:55,520 --> 02:42:01,720
Steve Jackson games, PrismNet, used to own a domain called io.com, and that's Illuminati

2604
02:42:01,720 --> 02:42:02,720
Online.

2605
02:42:02,720 --> 02:42:07,720
Now, this domain name actually led to the creation of the Electronic Frontier Foundation,

2606
02:42:07,720 --> 02:42:12,400
according to Flashdot.com, and they got their servers back, which they probably weren't

2607
02:42:12,400 --> 02:42:17,520
supposed to, and the big part of the hacker movement actually is the EFF, Electronic Frontier

2608
02:42:17,520 --> 02:42:18,520
Foundation.

2609
02:42:18,520 --> 02:42:19,520
Perhaps they could help you guys out.

2610
02:42:19,520 --> 02:42:27,440
In any case, July 1st, 2011, Richards & Richards sold the domain to an unnamed party, okay?

2611
02:42:27,440 --> 02:42:33,000
Now io.com is being sold, and it seems perhaps the Illuminati is back online in a big way

2612
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:36,960
cuz io.com now points to io data centers.

2613
02:42:36,960 --> 02:42:41,960
Get this, io is Goldman Sachs' worldwide vendor of choice for advanced data storage.

2614
02:42:41,960 --> 02:42:45,080
Listen, what you gotta do is you wanna shoot a YouTube video about this, you wanna write

2615
02:42:45,080 --> 02:42:49,040
an article about this, because it's complex, I'm not following it all.

2616
02:42:49,040 --> 02:42:53,080
Plus, I don't know if this video game maker is a devil high priest, cuz somebody said

2617
02:42:53,080 --> 02:42:54,080
so.

2618
02:42:54,080 --> 02:42:58,560
I'm a devil high priest, or a ninja warlock, cuz we joked about it once, they actually

2619
02:42:58,560 --> 02:43:03,920
think that's real now, that I'm a Vatican assassin ninja warlock, I mean, it's a joke.

2620
02:43:03,920 --> 02:43:07,680
But yeah, they have some deep knowledge about things for that card game.

2621
02:43:07,680 --> 02:43:12,480
But I mean, then people go too far, there's one card, looks like myself and Ron Paul in

2622
02:43:12,480 --> 02:43:15,360
it, and so that's proof that we're part of it.

2623
02:43:15,360 --> 02:43:21,280
I mean, but it is bizarre, I mean, cuz I've collected now, well, I haven't collected,

2624
02:43:21,280 --> 02:43:25,400
listeners have meld us the entire set, which is pretty rare, I think it's three or four

2625
02:43:25,400 --> 02:43:26,400
sets.

2626
02:43:26,400 --> 02:43:29,960
And you look at this, and it was made like 20 years ago, and you're like, how did they

2627
02:43:29,960 --> 02:43:30,960
do this?

2628
02:43:30,960 --> 02:43:31,960
How did they predict all this?

2629
02:43:31,960 --> 02:43:38,160
The tower's getting blown up, the Pentagon hit just like it got hit, staging terror,

2630
02:43:38,160 --> 02:43:43,360
COINTELPRO, I mean, it's just, wow, this guy really knew what he was talking about, but

2631
02:43:43,360 --> 02:43:45,760
he won't come on the show.

2632
02:43:45,760 --> 02:43:48,960
And so it's becoming an issue, thank you so much, I gotta move quick here now.

2633
02:43:48,960 --> 02:43:53,080
I wanna play some of these clips of Obama that David Knight worked to clip out from

2634
02:43:53,080 --> 02:43:55,040
the disgusting press conference.

2635
02:43:55,040 --> 02:43:57,400
Chris in Florida, you're on the air, welcome.

2636
02:43:57,400 --> 02:44:02,880
Well, Gun Appreciation Day, that'd be January 19th, as the last previous caller mentioned,

2637
02:44:02,880 --> 02:44:07,720
that was Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s 84th birthday.

2638
02:44:07,720 --> 02:44:11,040
And we- By the way, he went and got a concealed carry

2639
02:44:11,040 --> 02:44:12,040
permit.

2640
02:44:12,040 --> 02:44:14,640
He went and was trying to get a gun permit right before they killed him.

2641
02:44:14,640 --> 02:44:19,440
Absolutely, and the deacons of defense who provided security for him from the KKK and

2642
02:44:19,440 --> 02:44:23,920
other government-sponsored race-baitors, but we need to demand an apology from our government.

2643
02:44:23,920 --> 02:44:29,920
Of course, you know about the 1999 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. family's court case at the

2644
02:44:29,920 --> 02:44:35,520
kingcenter.org, a unanimous jury decision that his assassination was a conspiracy by

2645
02:44:35,520 --> 02:44:43,320
state, local, and federal officials, and this was after expert testimony, 70 witnesses,

2646
02:44:43,320 --> 02:44:49,560
and a civil trial in Memphis, Tennessee, unanimous decision on December 8th, 1999, after about

2647
02:44:49,560 --> 02:44:51,560
an hour of deliberation.

2648
02:44:51,560 --> 02:44:58,040
So that's one point I wanna mention, and also the FDA has their adverse event reporting

2649
02:44:58,040 --> 02:45:03,440
system on 31 drugs that are disproportionately linked to the reports of violent behavior

2650
02:45:03,440 --> 02:45:04,440
towards others.

2651
02:45:04,440 --> 02:45:08,840
Now, we have a two-year-old Time magazine article that lists the top 10, it's entitled

2652
02:45:08,840 --> 02:45:14,040
Top 10 Illegal Drugs Linked to Violence, and four of which are fluorinated.

2653
02:45:14,040 --> 02:45:16,840
That'd be Prozac, Luvox, Effexor, and Paxil.

2654
02:45:16,840 --> 02:45:23,560
Next, I would like to also mention that Cheers Morgan is in violation, subject to life sentence

2655
02:45:23,560 --> 02:45:28,920
or death penalty, for the death threat against you, Alex, Title 18, Section 241 and 242.

2656
02:45:28,920 --> 02:45:34,360
That would also include those co-conspirators on the air, Buzz Buzzinger, sports columnist

2657
02:45:34,360 --> 02:45:39,680
for the Daily Beef, and Abby Huntsman of the Huffington Post, they have not redacted their

2658
02:45:39,680 --> 02:45:44,560
conspiracy against you, Alex, and that's something that ought to be harped on.

2659
02:45:44,560 --> 02:45:48,840
Joyce Riley showed this morning, was also very good on the Hensah-Neewick Elementary

2660
02:45:48,840 --> 02:45:52,720
School shooting, she spent two hours with a private investigator, so check out the Power

2661
02:45:52,720 --> 02:45:55,600
Hour, and that's a lot of awesome research.

2662
02:45:55,600 --> 02:45:59,720
All right, buddy, I really appreciate your call, that's a lot of info, boy, my head wasn't

2663
02:45:59,720 --> 02:46:01,080
spinning it is now.

2664
02:46:01,080 --> 02:46:06,800
Here's the breaking news, document cam, please, now is the time, the President's plan to protect

2665
02:46:06,800 --> 02:46:10,160
our children and our communities by reducing gun violence.

2666
02:46:10,160 --> 02:46:14,840
And Aaron Dykes, since this came out about 30 minutes ago, he and David Knight, both

2667
02:46:14,840 --> 02:46:19,920
crack researchers, have gone over it and indexed it, it is exactly what they already claimed

2668
02:46:19,920 --> 02:46:22,280
they were going to do.

2669
02:46:22,280 --> 02:46:26,680
It has created total gun hysteria, tie it to insurance, to get insurance you'll have

2670
02:46:26,680 --> 02:46:31,900
to have police brainwashing, active shooter drills, but never wear your arm to protect

2671
02:46:31,900 --> 02:46:38,080
yourself to teach you how to go lay in a corner so the executioner can kill you a little bit

2672
02:46:38,080 --> 02:46:39,080
more easily.

2673
02:46:39,080 --> 02:46:44,080
The BBC has called my phone, no exaggeration, 30, 40 times a day, I'm gonna take this right

2674
02:46:44,080 --> 02:46:45,080
now.

2675
02:46:45,080 --> 02:46:48,080
Hello, is this the BBC?

2676
02:46:48,080 --> 02:46:52,840
ITV, that's out of Canada, right?

2677
02:46:52,840 --> 02:46:58,480
Ma'am, ma'am, I lost my phone and I never put the voicemail back on it, just do me a

2678
02:46:58,480 --> 02:46:59,480
favor.

2679
02:46:59,480 --> 02:47:02,880
I'm gonna be off the air in about 15 minutes or so, why don't you text this?

2680
02:47:02,880 --> 02:47:08,240
Yeah, exactly, just text this number, your name and number and I or somebody will get

2681
02:47:08,240 --> 02:47:11,360
back with you, okay?

2682
02:47:11,360 --> 02:47:19,400
Thank you, this rings nonstop at every TV station you can imagine, I should be doing

2683
02:47:19,400 --> 02:47:23,160
all these interviews, but I'm just too burnt out, man.

2684
02:47:23,160 --> 02:47:27,080
And another thing is I get on these TV shows, I just wanna blow up at them, cuz I know we

2685
02:47:27,080 --> 02:47:32,780
got mafia running things, people are in a trance, and the whole system wants us to just

2686
02:47:32,780 --> 02:47:35,280
play along and just be real calm about it.

2687
02:47:35,280 --> 02:47:40,480
And then we need to be calm, no, the time for being calm is over, we got into this situation

2688
02:47:40,480 --> 02:47:41,480
by being calm.

2689
02:47:41,480 --> 02:47:45,820
I've intellectually been calm, I've analyzed the data, these people are criminals, I'm

2690
02:47:45,820 --> 02:47:48,820
done with them.

2691
02:47:48,820 --> 02:47:54,240
Excuse me, now the irritating thing is I was doing radio interviews driving in this morning

2692
02:47:54,240 --> 02:47:58,040
and TV stations would not stop calling it where I couldn't even do the radio interviews.

2693
02:47:58,040 --> 02:48:07,360
In fact, I was on our 50,000 watt KMJ and they literally, literally called 15 times

2694
02:48:07,360 --> 02:48:10,760
while I was on that 10 minute interview where the interview was worthless.

2695
02:48:10,760 --> 02:48:13,860
My wife's like, well, you gotta put the do not disturb on here, which I don't remember

2696
02:48:13,860 --> 02:48:17,200
to do, I'm not complaining on air, I didn't answer the phone to act powerful.

2697
02:48:17,200 --> 02:48:24,000
I'm just angry about this cuz they've been calling, see I'm angry, I shouldn't have guns,

2698
02:48:24,000 --> 02:48:25,280
I'm angry, I'm angry.

2699
02:48:25,280 --> 02:48:28,200
You wouldn't have a country if your forebearers weren't angry.

2700
02:48:28,200 --> 02:48:31,760
By the way, the reason we've had so much wealth, we haven't been perfect, we've been at our

2701
02:48:31,760 --> 02:48:32,760
own problems.

2702
02:48:32,760 --> 02:48:36,620
The reason we've had so much wealth is because we didn't let thugs get in control of us and

2703
02:48:36,620 --> 02:48:41,500
turn us into the other slaves, okay?

2704
02:48:41,500 --> 02:48:45,520
Our ancestors wouldn't put up with anybody's garbage and so there was a lot of private

2705
02:48:45,520 --> 02:48:50,480
independent operators and a free market got developed and we all got super rich.

2706
02:48:50,480 --> 02:48:55,360
Now we've gotten super decadent, we got taken over, now we're gonna get super poor again.

2707
02:48:55,360 --> 02:49:00,500
Because despots make everybody poor on purpose, plus they screw everything up, but they don't

2708
02:49:00,500 --> 02:49:02,600
care cuz they got theirs.

2709
02:49:02,600 --> 02:49:12,200
Anyways, they have analyzed it and it is used the healthcare law to force everybody to pay

2710
02:49:12,200 --> 02:49:14,400
for anti-gun training and anti-gun brainwashing.

2711
02:49:14,400 --> 02:49:18,760
So it's gonna be an anti-gun tax in Obamacare, cuz Obamacare is written where they can do

2712
02:49:18,760 --> 02:49:20,320
whatever they want.

2713
02:49:20,320 --> 02:49:26,840
That's probably the biggest thing here, turn the doctors into spies, have a national demonization

2714
02:49:26,840 --> 02:49:32,880
campaign run by Holder, national dialogue, talking about just putting people on lists

2715
02:49:32,880 --> 02:49:39,760
without any proof that they can't own guns, banning all private sales, physically banning

2716
02:49:39,760 --> 02:49:44,800
semi-autos and handguns if they can get it legislatively.

2717
02:49:44,800 --> 02:49:48,720
Arresting anybody that sells a gun to a neighbor, claiming all your guns retroactively to prove

2718
02:49:48,720 --> 02:49:50,280
where you got them.

2719
02:49:50,280 --> 02:49:55,320
They want you to have to come in and re-register them, active shooter training everywhere to

2720
02:49:55,320 --> 02:49:57,480
create more hype about mass shooting.

2721
02:49:57,480 --> 02:50:00,880
So all these mentally ill people just get told about mass shooting and shown how to

2722
02:50:00,880 --> 02:50:01,880
do it all day.

2723
02:50:01,880 --> 02:50:05,280
It's like the DARE program, it proved, made kids use more drugs.

2724
02:50:05,280 --> 02:50:10,160
It's like sex ed, I remember sitting there in seventh grader in sex ed, and they're sitting

2725
02:50:10,160 --> 02:50:13,520
there talking about sex and I'm looking over at the cheerleader next to me, and she's looking

2726
02:50:13,520 --> 02:50:14,520
over at me.

2727
02:50:14,520 --> 02:50:18,400
Just like, I think the point is it makes everybody go have sex, folks.

2728
02:50:18,400 --> 02:50:22,120
Well, it's the same thing here, you gotta tell the mentally ill people, hey, you wanna

2729
02:50:22,120 --> 02:50:23,120
go out with a bang?

2730
02:50:23,120 --> 02:50:25,560
Go to a school, shoot some people.

2731
02:50:25,560 --> 02:50:30,040
Model emergency response, FEMA involved, they want churches, campuses, everything to be

2732
02:50:30,040 --> 02:50:31,040
brainwashed.

2733
02:50:31,040 --> 02:50:37,240
They're gonna try to force gun manufacturers to put biometrics on all the guns.

2734
02:50:37,240 --> 02:50:42,160
They want high school resource anti-gun brainwashing officers who aren't armed.

2735
02:50:42,160 --> 02:50:45,880
But if they are to be armed, they're gonna be federal people in the schools turning into

2736
02:50:45,880 --> 02:50:49,800
a prison and a tattletale squad.

2737
02:50:49,800 --> 02:50:53,340
And this is how they totally, just like they converted the airports into police state zones

2738
02:50:53,340 --> 02:50:55,600
off of some staged events, they're doing the same thing here.

2739
02:50:55,600 --> 02:51:01,200
All right, we'll be back with more of your calls, stay with us.

2740
02:51:01,200 --> 02:51:04,920
If you've ever wanted one of our best selling generators, but we're waiting for an offer

2741
02:51:04,920 --> 02:51:09,960
so crazy you couldn't refuse, then you're not gonna wanna miss this exciting message.

2742
02:51:09,960 --> 02:51:10,960
Here's why.

2743
02:51:10,960 --> 02:51:13,960
Our solar generators provide life saving electrical power.

2744
02:51:13,960 --> 02:51:19,600
And unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no fumes, and produce electricity

2745
02:51:19,600 --> 02:51:20,600
from the sun.

2746
02:51:20,600 --> 02:51:24,040
So when the lights go out, you'll always have the power you need.

2747
02:51:24,040 --> 02:51:29,320
Now here's the best part, every year we accumulate a few solar generators that we just can't

2748
02:51:29,320 --> 02:51:30,320
sell as new.

2749
02:51:30,320 --> 02:51:35,520
We put them in a special spot in our warehouse and we discount them heavily at the end of

2750
02:51:35,520 --> 02:51:36,520
each year.

2751
02:51:36,520 --> 02:51:40,260
We call them scratch and dent units, but they're really just like new.

2752
02:51:40,260 --> 02:51:45,480
Each unit comes with a full factory warranty and special bonuses you just won't believe.

2753
02:51:45,480 --> 02:51:47,000
Don't wait, they go fast.

2754
02:51:47,000 --> 02:51:50,880
Go to scratchanddentsolar.com, that's scratchanddentsolar.com.

2755
02:51:50,880 --> 02:51:57,240
For the craziest offer we've ever made, go to scratchanddentsolar.com, that's scratchanddentsolar.com.

2756
02:51:57,240 --> 02:52:03,480
Hi there, my name is Frank Bates.

2757
02:52:03,480 --> 02:52:07,160
What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble.

2758
02:52:07,160 --> 02:52:13,400
I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity

2759
02:52:13,400 --> 02:52:18,160
monopolies and government agencies for what they really are, incompetent line crooks that

2760
02:52:18,160 --> 02:52:23,280
are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high.

2761
02:52:23,280 --> 02:52:27,280
Some have called this a conspiracy, others have called it a cover-up and you will be

2762
02:52:27,280 --> 02:52:31,160
shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy goes.

2763
02:52:31,160 --> 02:52:36,820
My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them

2764
02:52:36,820 --> 02:52:39,240
and how you can beat them too.

2765
02:52:39,240 --> 02:52:43,000
Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen

2766
02:52:43,000 --> 02:52:44,720
in the last three months.

2767
02:52:44,720 --> 02:52:50,080
Go to 123coverup.com and discover one weird trick to slash your power bill and protect

2768
02:52:50,080 --> 02:52:51,080
your home.

2769
02:52:51,080 --> 02:52:57,240
Go watch my video now at 123coverup.com before they force me to shut it down.

2770
02:52:57,240 --> 02:52:59,240
Again, that's 123coverup.com.

2771
02:52:59,240 --> 02:53:05,920
Injuries, slow healing, aches and pains, constipation, weakness, fatigue are all common the older

2772
02:53:05,920 --> 02:53:06,920
one gets.

2773
02:53:06,920 --> 02:53:10,560
The progressive deterioration of the body that occurs almost universally the older one

2774
02:53:10,560 --> 02:53:16,200
gets can partly to significantly be prevented with conscientious attention to nutrition.

2775
02:53:16,200 --> 02:53:20,420
If the Hanza men can play rugby in their 90s, then it is possible for everyone in North

2776
02:53:20,420 --> 02:53:23,460
America to experience a more youthful life as well.

2777
02:53:23,460 --> 02:53:27,640
One key ingredient to warding off aging and reversing some of it is the type and quality

2778
02:53:27,640 --> 02:53:29,080
of protein consumed.

2779
02:53:29,080 --> 02:53:33,520
All protein foods or supplements you currently consume are heat damaged, destroying 50 to

2780
02:53:33,520 --> 02:53:38,220
75% of your ability to utilize the bodybuilding amino acids.

2781
02:53:38,220 --> 02:53:43,940
One World Way is not heat damaged and allows your body to utilize 100% of the amino acids.

2782
02:53:43,940 --> 02:53:46,320
This feat no one else has achieved.

2783
02:53:46,320 --> 02:53:49,200
The results to your health can be amazing.

2784
02:53:49,200 --> 02:53:51,740
Call 888-988-3325.

2785
02:53:51,740 --> 02:53:54,520
That's 888-988-3325.

2786
02:53:54,520 --> 02:53:56,840
Or visit OneWorldWay.com.

2787
02:53:56,840 --> 02:54:20,160
That's OneWorldWay.com Listen, I've got to go over the Obama speech.

2788
02:54:20,160 --> 02:54:21,160
We've got all the clips.

2789
02:54:21,160 --> 02:54:25,000
We're going to go into overdrive here today and we've got all these callers that are holding

2790
02:54:25,000 --> 02:54:27,760
like Mike in Texas and so many others.

2791
02:54:27,760 --> 02:54:30,760
And we will take a ton of your calls in the next hour.

2792
02:54:30,760 --> 02:54:34,760
And of course, Infowars Nightly News tonight is going to have my good friend and gun dealer

2793
02:54:34,760 --> 02:54:39,740
and New American Magazine researcher and writer Bob Dacy is going to be here analyzing it.

2794
02:54:39,740 --> 02:54:42,320
This is all about the UN treaty coming up.

2795
02:54:42,320 --> 02:54:44,560
And Aaron Dykes was just showing me more.

2796
02:54:44,560 --> 02:54:46,200
It's really bad.

2797
02:54:46,200 --> 02:54:50,080
They're going to just have Health and Human Services.

2798
02:54:50,080 --> 02:54:53,280
If you're handicapped, you're not going to be able to have a gun.

2799
02:54:53,280 --> 02:54:57,320
And what I just read, and it's directly from Health and Human Services, it's why it's hard

2800
02:54:57,320 --> 02:55:00,600
to do the show right now because I'm out there reading stuff during the breaks and then it's

2801
02:55:00,600 --> 02:55:01,600
just overwhelming.

2802
02:55:01,600 --> 02:55:06,760
It looks like they're going to try to take handicapped people's weapons, not even mentally

2803
02:55:06,760 --> 02:55:07,760
handicapped.

2804
02:55:07,760 --> 02:55:10,640
I mean, it's unbelievable.

2805
02:55:10,640 --> 02:55:11,640
It's unbelievable.

2806
02:55:11,640 --> 02:55:16,200
And then they're just going to pick and choose gun owners to come harass and SWAT team and

2807
02:55:16,200 --> 02:55:17,200
stuff.

2808
02:55:17,200 --> 02:55:22,400
And then just have a huge unending brainwashing campaign like the Attorney General said against

2809
02:55:22,400 --> 02:55:23,400
Republicans.

2810
02:55:23,400 --> 02:55:27,480
All I know is we've got to get aggressive, have national days where we have our guns

2811
02:55:27,480 --> 02:55:28,480
out in public.

2812
02:55:28,480 --> 02:55:32,640
They hate that because they like to have TV act like guns are already illegal.

2813
02:55:32,640 --> 02:55:36,960
We've been fighting back and we've got good sheriffs, good police that are servants that

2814
02:55:36,960 --> 02:55:40,360
by the way, I noticed her dressed like police and not army commandos.

2815
02:55:40,360 --> 02:55:46,760
You can always see the good cops are dressed like dignified public servants and not like

2816
02:55:46,760 --> 02:55:47,760
goons.

2817
02:55:47,760 --> 02:55:53,240
But side issue, I was on Porter Stansbury's radio show this morning and he lives in Miami

2818
02:55:53,240 --> 02:55:56,880
during the winter.

2819
02:55:56,880 --> 02:55:58,880
Not a bad idea, beautiful.

2820
02:55:58,880 --> 02:56:03,080
And my allergies are so bad from the cedar during the winter.

2821
02:56:03,080 --> 02:56:06,640
I'm thinking about going to Miami or something for three months out of the year and remoting

2822
02:56:06,640 --> 02:56:08,880
into the office because of these cedar allergies.

2823
02:56:08,880 --> 02:56:13,320
But the point is that he said, yeah, I really like the cops around here.

2824
02:56:13,320 --> 02:56:17,240
They dress in just nice conservative outfits, they're real nice.

2825
02:56:17,240 --> 02:56:21,560
He goes, I came down now, they're like Darth Vader cars, Darth Vader outfits.

2826
02:56:21,560 --> 02:56:25,340
They pull over families and get their shotguns out when they walk up.

2827
02:56:25,340 --> 02:56:28,280
And he doesn't even know if he wants to stay there anymore.

2828
02:56:28,280 --> 02:56:30,680
I mean, it's just, that's one thing I got to say for R.D.

2829
02:56:30,680 --> 02:56:31,680
Cevita.

2830
02:56:31,680 --> 02:56:35,660
He's trying to put the police back in old fashioned police uniforms and old fashioned

2831
02:56:35,660 --> 02:56:39,200
police cars and have them act like old fashioned cops.

2832
02:56:39,200 --> 02:56:45,640
I mean, can't we just have that, do we have to have people playing Rambo all day and then

2833
02:56:45,640 --> 02:56:47,280
acting like we're the enemy?

2834
02:56:47,280 --> 02:56:49,040
A military fights an enemy.

2835
02:56:49,040 --> 02:56:52,200
I don't want my police to look like a military.

2836
02:56:52,200 --> 02:56:57,280
I want my military to look like a military, and I don't want my military operating domestically.

2837
02:56:57,280 --> 02:57:01,840
But support the broadcast, get the Propure water filters, 10% off the promo code water.

2838
02:57:01,840 --> 02:57:07,720
They're the best side by side comparison against the leading competitors, available at Infowarshop.com.

2839
02:57:07,720 --> 02:57:09,560
And we've got more of these in now.

2840
02:57:09,560 --> 02:57:12,460
We've been selling hundreds of these a day and that helps get the word out and fund the

2841
02:57:12,460 --> 02:57:19,160
operation that come and take it, new t-shirts are out with an AK-47 with the Second Amendment

2842
02:57:19,160 --> 02:57:21,540
printed inside the AK-47.

2843
02:57:21,540 --> 02:57:26,160
The best seller, $19.95, available at Infowarshop.com.

2844
02:57:26,160 --> 02:57:32,040
So you support the broadcast and you support the Second Amendment at the same time.

2845
02:57:32,040 --> 02:57:35,600
Okay, let's just go to calls next hour cuz I don't wanna go to somebody and cut them

2846
02:57:35,600 --> 02:57:36,960
off short.

2847
02:57:36,960 --> 02:57:43,160
Mike and Antoine and Craig and Jim and Joseph and everybody else, the toll free number to

2848
02:57:43,160 --> 02:57:47,040
join us, 800-25-99231.

2849
02:57:47,040 --> 02:57:50,880
And just have your point ready, we'll try to go to the next person as best I can.

2850
02:57:50,880 --> 02:57:54,360
Again, my head is spinning right now.

2851
02:57:54,360 --> 02:57:57,720
Aaron Dykes and the entire team are in there.

2852
02:57:57,720 --> 02:58:03,920
Steve Watson, Paul Watson, Don Salazar, Kurt Nemo, Mike Adams is basically an unofficial

2853
02:58:03,920 --> 02:58:06,780
member of the team, hammering through this.

2854
02:58:06,780 --> 02:58:12,520
And it's all nebulous, but we got them because with each thing they've called for nebulous,

2855
02:58:12,520 --> 02:58:17,160
we have previous policy and bills they've introduced by the very people on this board

2856
02:58:17,160 --> 02:58:20,680
in some cases, we know their attack profile.

2857
02:58:20,680 --> 02:58:26,800
You already know what it is, register, confiscate, shut down ammo manufacturers, harass gun dealers,

2858
02:58:26,800 --> 02:58:32,720
harass gun manufacturers, sue gun manufacturers, ban importation, put you on no buy list with

2859
02:58:32,720 --> 02:58:38,800
no proof for no reason, SWAT team and harass gun owners, demonize gun ownership everywhere,

2860
02:58:38,800 --> 02:58:39,800
unbelievable.

2871
02:59:21,760 --> 02:59:23,160
harmful pathogens.

2872
02:59:23,160 --> 02:59:28,040
This new technology has the ability to terminate entire colonies of harmful bacteria at several

2873
02:59:28,040 --> 02:59:32,180
hundred times the effectiveness of colloidal or ionic silver solutions.

2874
02:59:32,180 --> 02:59:35,840

2879
02:59:55,760 --> 03:00:05,760
You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.

2880
03:00:05,760 --> 03:00:10,600
Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.

2881
03:00:10,600 --> 03:00:11,600
You want answers?

2882
03:00:11,600 --> 03:00:13,720
Well, so does he.

2883
03:00:13,720 --> 03:00:17,920
He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.

2884
03:00:17,920 --> 03:00:26,000
And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.

2885
03:00:26,000 --> 03:00:30,360
Folks, if you go up to infoawards.com, it's been up and down today under a coordinated

2886
03:00:30,360 --> 03:00:34,240
denial of service attack, the biggest we've ever seen.

2887
03:00:34,240 --> 03:00:35,240
Does it matter?

2888
03:00:35,240 --> 03:00:37,280
We'll just start even more backup websites.

2889
03:00:37,280 --> 03:00:40,800
Our listeners will just get the impeachment articles out to even more people, get them

2890
03:00:40,800 --> 03:00:42,600
out to every member of Congress.

2891
03:00:42,600 --> 03:00:45,760
I'll talk about it after we take calls and I got some clips of the president we're going

2892
03:00:45,760 --> 03:00:46,840
to analyze coming up here.

2893
03:00:46,840 --> 03:00:51,000
But it's the same thing with Obamacare, left it nebulous, and now he's just going to do

2894
03:00:51,000 --> 03:00:54,160
whatever he wants.

2895
03:00:54,160 --> 03:00:55,720
And they are licking their chops.

2896
03:00:55,720 --> 03:01:01,000
I mean, they know there's going to be another mass shooting with all this media hype, guaranteed.

2897
03:01:01,000 --> 03:01:02,640
And it's just a matter of time.

2898
03:01:02,640 --> 03:01:04,080
And if they're in, they'll stage one.

2899
03:01:04,080 --> 03:01:07,920
And like Larry Pratt said, you notice the media won't attack Larry Pratt for that.

2900
03:01:07,920 --> 03:01:09,560
They tried and dropped it.

2901
03:01:09,560 --> 03:01:13,800
Remember Larry Pratt after Aurora, he said on my show and others, and it made national

2902
03:01:13,800 --> 03:01:18,040
news, but then they backed off, Larry Pratt says the government could have staged this.

2903
03:01:18,040 --> 03:01:21,280
What he said was if they staged Fast and Furious, they could have staged this.

2904
03:01:21,280 --> 03:01:23,360
Ladies and gentlemen, they're the prime suspects.

2905
03:01:23,360 --> 03:01:27,360
And then each event has so many earmarks.

2906
03:01:27,360 --> 03:01:32,600
It'd be like if you were a cop and you're driving by a bank and you see guys running

2907
03:01:32,600 --> 03:01:37,360
out with masks on and bags over their shoulders and guns in their belts.

2908
03:01:37,360 --> 03:01:42,720
I mean, that's probable cause, they're bank robbers.

2909
03:01:42,720 --> 03:01:46,240
I mean, if they don't stop, you can shoot them.

2910
03:01:46,240 --> 03:01:49,560
I mean, it's the same deal.

2911
03:01:49,560 --> 03:01:53,720
I mean, they have done this stuff before, they stand to gain from it.

2912
03:01:53,720 --> 03:01:58,360
And all the anomalies and the things involved, I don't just say this because I want to think

2913
03:01:58,360 --> 03:02:00,520
this, it's overwhelming.

2914
03:02:00,520 --> 03:02:06,800
And I haven't even been touching it a lot, people are mad at me.

2915
03:02:06,800 --> 03:02:08,560
Because people are like, yeah, this is blaringly staged.

2916
03:02:08,560 --> 03:02:11,800
Yeah, of course it's staged, of course it's staged.

2917
03:02:11,800 --> 03:02:15,200
There's some real mass school shootings, but these things, you get a mental patient in

2918
03:02:15,200 --> 03:02:16,200
there, you shoot them.

2919
03:02:16,200 --> 03:02:18,120
You have organized crime, shoot some kids.

2920
03:02:18,120 --> 03:02:19,120
They get out.

2921
03:02:19,120 --> 03:02:23,200
Even if they get caught, the feds say, let them go, and then you just change the story

2922
03:02:23,200 --> 03:02:24,200
around.

2923
03:02:24,200 --> 03:02:26,560
And I haven't even gotten into homes.

2924
03:02:26,560 --> 03:02:28,000
I mean, that is incredible.

2925
03:02:28,000 --> 03:02:30,400
Mike in Texas, you're on the air, thanks for holding.

2926
03:02:30,400 --> 03:02:32,000
Guns and Obama, you're on the air.

2927
03:02:32,000 --> 03:02:33,000
Go ahead.

2928
03:02:33,000 --> 03:02:38,720
Hey, Alex, my family and I are praying for you, you're doing the yeoman's job there.

2929
03:02:38,720 --> 03:02:42,640
I hope that nothing happens.

2930
03:02:42,640 --> 03:02:44,000
I hope everything stays peaceful.

2931
03:02:44,000 --> 03:02:48,320
Well, listen, I only whine about it and I've gotten my will redone and stuff, because there

2932
03:02:48,320 --> 03:02:50,560
is a chance they may set me up or do something.

2933
03:02:50,560 --> 03:02:52,680
I'm just letting people know this is real.

2934
03:02:52,680 --> 03:02:57,600
I'm not putting it out there, ooh, the show's spooky, and oh man, I mean, these are criminals.

2935
03:02:57,600 --> 03:03:01,420
And a lot of people aren't fighting them because they know they're criminals.

2936
03:03:01,420 --> 03:03:03,680
And I'm just saying, let's just get this out in the open.

2937
03:03:03,680 --> 03:03:05,320
Sorry, go ahead.

2938
03:03:05,320 --> 03:03:10,800
Well, you know, we are the cops out in front of the bank, and these guys are the robbers.

2939
03:03:10,800 --> 03:03:15,480
They just ran out, they got the masks on, they got the guns, and they're saying, hey,

2940
03:03:15,480 --> 03:03:19,400
you know, we'll just go ahead and gaslight these people and say, hey, turn over your

2941
03:03:19,400 --> 03:03:20,400
guns.

2942
03:03:20,400 --> 03:03:24,080
You can't get us, we just robbed the bank, you can't do anything about it.

2943
03:03:24,080 --> 03:03:29,720
But the one thing I called in about is, you know, Obama sounds real reasonable to the

2944
03:03:29,720 --> 03:03:36,680
soccer moms and to everybody that wants to obey the law and has empathy for the parents

2945
03:03:36,680 --> 03:03:39,880
and the children that were killed and all of that.

2946
03:03:39,880 --> 03:03:42,280
Everything he says is real reasonable.

2947
03:03:42,280 --> 03:03:49,280
The only problem is, you know, he works for us, and he wants a background check so that

2948
03:03:49,280 --> 03:03:50,860
we can have our guns.

2949
03:03:50,860 --> 03:03:54,760
What about, he's working for us, we need a background check on him.

2950
03:03:54,760 --> 03:03:57,720
He has access to weapons of mass destruction.

2951
03:03:57,720 --> 03:04:00,880
He has access to predator drones.

2952
03:04:00,880 --> 03:04:05,240
Exactly, he won't release any of his college records, he won't release any of it.

2953
03:04:05,240 --> 03:04:07,280
He's got multiple names on record.

2954
03:04:07,280 --> 03:04:10,320
He's in college magazines under other names.

2955
03:04:10,320 --> 03:04:12,020
We don't know who this guy is.

2956
03:04:12,020 --> 03:04:13,840
For all I know, he could be a robot.

2957
03:04:13,840 --> 03:04:17,740
I mean, I'm joking when I say that, but I mean, he is Mr. Mystery.

2958
03:04:17,740 --> 03:04:19,560
That's why more and more I'm getting freaked out by him.

2959
03:04:19,560 --> 03:04:24,240
I mean, I, man, I tell you, we're in trouble, that's all I can tell you.

2960
03:04:24,240 --> 03:04:25,920
Yeah, why are we putting up with this?

2961
03:04:25,920 --> 03:04:30,720
I mean, you know, this is the thing that should be put out there.

2962
03:04:30,720 --> 03:04:35,880
You know, he's never gone through a background check here, you know?

2963
03:04:35,880 --> 03:04:36,880
We know he's bad.

2964
03:04:36,880 --> 03:04:37,880
No, it's true.

2965
03:04:37,880 --> 03:04:41,240
In fact, they've had news articles saying, to work at the post office, you'd have to

2966
03:04:41,240 --> 03:04:44,280
have more of a background check than Obama's had.

2967
03:04:44,280 --> 03:04:48,760
And that's why they've got him in there, is because who knows who he really is?

2968
03:04:48,760 --> 03:04:53,000
Barry Sotero, who knows who his dad really is?

2969
03:04:53,000 --> 03:04:57,840
All these other names, he's got at least three different names that have been his name on

2970
03:04:57,840 --> 03:04:58,840
record.

2971
03:04:58,840 --> 03:04:59,840
We'll be right back.

2972
03:04:59,840 --> 03:05:07,680
Hello, I'm Alex Jones, myself, my family, the Infowars.com team want to relay to you

2973
03:05:07,680 --> 03:05:12,920
and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalist on every

2974
03:05:12,920 --> 03:05:13,920
front.

2975
03:05:13,920 --> 03:05:19,720
Infowars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats, but we can't do that without

2976
03:05:19,720 --> 03:05:25,720
your help by getting the films, bumper stickers and T-shirts at Infowars.com, you will wake

2977
03:05:25,720 --> 03:05:31,960
up people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.

2978
03:05:31,960 --> 03:05:35,440
We need your help to spread the word like never before.

2979
03:05:35,440 --> 03:05:41,640
They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.

2980
03:05:41,640 --> 03:05:49,080
You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization

2981
03:05:49,080 --> 03:05:50,560
and ultimate extermination.

2982
03:05:50,560 --> 03:05:53,000
The war is here.

2983
03:05:53,000 --> 03:05:54,840
It's an info war.

2984
03:05:54,840 --> 03:06:02,560
The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.

2985
03:06:02,560 --> 03:06:07,920
Fight back this cold and flu season with the world's best garlic extract, Ali-C. Why Ali-C?

2986
03:06:07,920 --> 03:06:11,200
Because it helps your body fight viruses, bacteria and fungi.

2987
03:06:11,200 --> 03:06:16,180
Ali-C has been scientifically proven in double blind studies using low doses to greatly reduce

2988
03:06:16,180 --> 03:06:19,240
the number, severity and duration of common colds.

2989
03:06:19,240 --> 03:06:24,320
Ali-C contains 300 milligrams of stabilized allicin, the active ingredient in crushed

2990
03:06:24,320 --> 03:06:25,320
garlic.

2991
03:06:25,320 --> 03:06:30,200
Studies show Ali-C is effective against MRSA, bacterial, fungal and viral infections.

2992
03:06:30,200 --> 03:06:33,720
One tablet of Ali-C has the equivalent of 40 cloves of garlic.

2993
03:06:33,720 --> 03:06:38,360
Ali-C supports your body's resistance to all types of conditions and can help lower high

2994
03:06:38,360 --> 03:06:40,240
blood pressure and high cholesterol.

3000

level is high and your pH level is low.

3001
03:07:11,320 --> 03:07:12,800
How does acid enter your body?

3002
03:07:12,800 --> 03:07:18,160
A cup of coffee, a sandwich, tap water, stress and cell phones, plus your own body produces

3003
03:07:18,160 --> 03:07:19,720
acid on a regular basis.

he.

3014
03:08:14,000 --> 03:08:22,320
He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.

3015
03:08:22,320 --> 03:08:31,560
All right, it's official, we're trying to get the full text of all of them, we're live

3016
03:08:31,560 --> 03:08:34,720
here at 208 Central.

3017
03:08:34,720 --> 03:08:41,520
Obama signs 23 executive orders to curb gun violence, urges Congress to act.

3018
03:08:41,520 --> 03:08:46,120
And we're gonna be going over all of this and playing some of the clips and then going

3019
03:08:46,120 --> 03:08:47,120
back to your phone calls.

3020
03:08:47,120 --> 03:08:54,480
The latest is all up at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com, we'll have a lot more tonight, 7 o'clock

3021
03:08:54,480 --> 03:09:03,440
Central for the Infowars Nightly News at infowarsnews.com.

3022
03:09:03,440 --> 03:09:07,840
Now if you go up to infowars.com, it's scrolled down to the bottom of the featured news area,

3023
03:09:07,840 --> 03:09:11,800
it's citizens file articles of impeachment against Obama.

3024
03:09:11,800 --> 03:09:16,000
And again, most people get it, some are saying, well, how do you file that?

3025
03:09:16,000 --> 03:09:21,120
I'm publicly putting out with links to the lawyers and congressmen and women's statements

3026
03:09:21,120 --> 03:09:26,600
and with the text of the Constitution where Obama is clearly violating Article I, Section

3027
03:09:26,600 --> 03:09:27,600
9.

3028
03:09:27,600 --> 03:09:32,440
And I just go on and on and on, showing all the high crimes and misdemeanors and what

3029
03:09:32,440 --> 03:09:33,840
Congress is to do.

3030
03:09:33,840 --> 03:09:38,720
And I think I'll go in there and add some statements as well and show some more of the

3031
03:09:38,720 --> 03:09:39,720
Constitution at the bottom of the article.

3032
03:09:39,720 --> 03:09:45,040
Then I have a video breaking it down there, but citizens file articles of impeachment

3033
03:09:45,040 --> 03:09:46,280
against Obama.

3034
03:09:46,280 --> 03:09:49,240
Where you really wanna go is drudgereport.com, that's where I go.

3035
03:09:49,240 --> 03:09:55,760
And if you go there, it's got all the latest too, as it's breaking, but the ammo shortages

3036
03:09:55,760 --> 03:09:58,480
are so bad cuz of citizens buying ammo.

3037
03:09:58,480 --> 03:10:02,240
And now you know Homeland Security bought 1.6 billion bullets, more than they'd use

3038
03:10:02,240 --> 03:10:05,600
for target practice in a decade, that's 1.6 billion bullets.

3039
03:10:05,600 --> 03:10:10,560
That's enough bullets to shoot every person in America more than four times.

3040
03:10:10,560 --> 03:10:17,480
Hollow points, 223, 308, hollow point 40, they did all this because they knew this was

3041
03:10:17,480 --> 03:10:18,480
coming.

3042
03:10:18,480 --> 03:10:22,320
And Obama's on record, that's the thing I get so mad about.

3043
03:10:22,320 --> 03:10:26,960
They all admit they've always wanted total abolition of our guns, the UN treaty pushes

3044
03:10:26,960 --> 03:10:27,960
that.

3045
03:10:27,960 --> 03:10:34,100
The abolition of civilian ownership of firearms, because civilian ownership of firearms threatens

3046
03:10:34,100 --> 03:10:36,820
the legitimate power monopoly of the state.

3047
03:10:36,820 --> 03:10:43,720
That's a quote from Unideer and the treaty in July 7th, 2001.

3048
03:10:43,720 --> 03:10:46,520
And it's the same treaty today, they just added to it.

3049
03:10:46,520 --> 03:10:52,340
This is their goal, don't say it's about the dead kids, it's about domination.

3050
03:10:52,340 --> 03:10:55,120
Because every country where they take the guns, the cops are running around in black

3051
03:10:55,120 --> 03:11:00,280
masks with machine guns and torturing people and arresting everybody in giant prisons,

3052
03:11:00,280 --> 03:11:01,280
okay?

3053
03:11:01,280 --> 03:11:04,040
We know what this is about.

3054
03:11:04,040 --> 03:11:06,800
Let's start going to some of these clips, and we'll have more of these on the nightly

3055
03:11:06,800 --> 03:11:07,800
news tonight.

3056
03:11:07,800 --> 03:11:10,960
Jacari Jax is doing it, but undoubtedly I'll do some special reports as well.

3057
03:11:10,960 --> 03:11:15,000
Cuz as soon as the broadcast is over, I'm gonna put my head in all this and come up

3058
03:11:15,000 --> 03:11:16,000
with some statements.

3059
03:11:16,000 --> 03:11:20,120
It's exactly what we thought, but even bigger, they're gonna swarm us with our own tax money

3060
03:11:20,120 --> 03:11:22,220
to take our guns at every level.

3061
03:11:22,220 --> 03:11:29,000
They're gonna make the entire homeland security hysteria and fear about guns.

3062
03:11:29,000 --> 03:11:33,320
They're trying to kill the gun culture, and I got news for you, it's gonna backfire.

3063
03:11:33,320 --> 03:11:37,260
Currently, there's gonna be more mass shootings, though.

3064
03:11:37,260 --> 03:11:40,800
That's why they're so confident, they've got something really nasty planned.

3065
03:11:40,800 --> 03:11:45,560
Like Fast and Furious was when the Second Amendment, thousands of dead Mexicans conservatively,

3066
03:11:45,560 --> 03:11:49,020
hundreds of dead Americans conservatively, five dead law enforcement conservatively on

3067
03:11:49,020 --> 03:11:51,760
our side, hundreds on their side.

3068
03:11:51,760 --> 03:11:58,400
Thousands of citizens, civilians, as we're called, these are cold-blooded mafia dons.

3069
03:11:58,400 --> 03:12:03,640
I mean, Obama admits he signs death orders, what is it, every Tuesday for hundreds of

3070
03:12:03,640 --> 03:12:08,380
drone strikes, because it's okay when he does, even though it violates international law.

3071
03:12:08,380 --> 03:12:11,920
In all these countries we're not even at war with, that Congress hasn't authorized, and

3072
03:12:11,920 --> 03:12:16,280
they'll blow up an entire apartment building to get one bad guy, they say.

3073
03:12:16,280 --> 03:12:19,000
And it's like, well, that's collateral damage, yeah, dead kids.

3074
03:12:19,000 --> 03:12:27,000
Go out and play golf, smoke cigarettes, drink whiskey, you know what Obama does.

3075
03:12:27,000 --> 03:12:32,760
I mean, this is disgusting exploitation, and the high-fying makes me wanna throw up.

3076
03:12:32,760 --> 03:12:36,040
Drudge has a photo of that up on his site, we can play it here for viewers.

3077
03:12:36,040 --> 03:12:39,160
But radio listeners, we've got it linked up at info-wars.com as well.

3078
03:12:39,160 --> 03:12:41,660
Yeah, there's the clapping and all of it.

3079
03:12:41,660 --> 03:12:45,240
Here's the first clip, universal background checks, okay?

3080
03:12:45,240 --> 03:12:51,600
Obama, we're gonna go to the clip, 11 minutes into his speech, he says 40% not checked,

3081
03:12:51,600 --> 03:12:54,680
yeah, when you sell it to your neighbor, or they sell it to you.

3082
03:12:54,680 --> 03:13:00,240
I mean, criminals are always gonna get guns, they bust cops all the time selling guns they've

3083
03:13:00,240 --> 03:13:01,240
gotten in buybacks.

3084
03:13:01,240 --> 03:13:05,360
So here's the universal background check comment by Obama.

3085
03:13:05,360 --> 03:13:10,020
First, it's time for Congress to require a universal background check for anyone trying

3086
03:13:10,020 --> 03:13:11,020
to buy a gun.

3087
03:13:11,020 --> 03:13:14,960
The law already requires licensed gun dealers to run background checks, and over the last

3088
03:13:14,960 --> 03:13:19,640
14 years, that's kept 1.5 million of the wrong people from getting their hands on a gun.

3089
03:13:19,640 --> 03:13:21,120
All right, that's enough.

3090
03:13:21,120 --> 03:13:22,120
But it's hard to enforce that, though.

3091
03:13:22,120 --> 03:13:26,320
Yeah, but Adam Lanza, your patsy- When as many as 40% of all gun purchases are

3092
03:13:26,320 --> 03:13:28,880
conducted- That's good, I'm gonna go back to the air.

3093
03:13:28,880 --> 03:13:36,040
Adam Lanza, your patsy, I guess they're so used to me in the first hour talking over

3094
03:13:36,040 --> 03:13:37,040
him, I'm doing it again.

3095
03:13:37,040 --> 03:13:38,440
Yes, you're right.

3096
03:13:38,440 --> 03:13:46,080
Adam Lanza, the patsy, or whoever he is, the whacked out of his mind, the cover of a Hollywood

3097
03:13:46,080 --> 03:13:49,760
movie about mind control, same look in all these guys' eyes.

3098
03:13:49,760 --> 03:13:55,280
On psychotropics, under psychiatric care, they fought like a devil to keep that from

3099
03:13:55,280 --> 03:14:00,400
coming out, but his family's on record now.

3100
03:14:00,400 --> 03:14:03,160
He tried to buy a gun five times and couldn't get one.

3101
03:14:03,160 --> 03:14:08,400
I mean, obviously, going to gun shop, plus his mental illness was in the health record.

3102
03:14:08,400 --> 03:14:12,080
They got filed, and he looked like he was whacked out of his brain.

3103
03:14:12,080 --> 03:14:15,960
I've been at gun shows with private dealers, somebody selling off their collection.

3104
03:14:15,960 --> 03:14:19,280
They don't sell to people that look like they're illegal aliens, they don't sell to people

3105
03:14:19,280 --> 03:14:20,280
that don't.

3106
03:14:20,280 --> 03:14:21,720
They'll talk to you before they sell you a gun.

3107
03:14:21,720 --> 03:14:23,320
And so what if you're a felon?

3108
03:14:23,320 --> 03:14:24,920
Most felons were innocent.

3109
03:14:24,920 --> 03:14:28,240
Or who's to say if somebody did a white collar crime 20 years ago, they can't have a gun

3110
03:14:28,240 --> 03:14:29,240
to protect themselves?

3111
03:14:29,240 --> 03:14:33,920
Look, here's the deal, you try to take somebody's guns, they're gonna try to take your guns,

3112
03:14:33,920 --> 03:14:34,920
it's real simple.

3113
03:14:34,920 --> 03:14:38,260
In the old days, when you got let out of prison, if you were arrested with a gun that you legally

3114
03:14:38,260 --> 03:14:43,200
owned, your gun until the 50s in most states was given back to you.

3115
03:14:43,200 --> 03:14:47,640
Here's your shotgun you were arrested with, you bought down at Sears and Roebuck.

3116
03:14:47,640 --> 03:14:54,180
Don't try to use that illegally, because people got it, a criminal's gonna get a gun anyways.

3117
03:14:54,180 --> 03:14:59,320
And I understand it's a way to put criminals back in jail if you catch them with guns again.

3118
03:14:59,320 --> 03:15:05,360
Look, all that should be in prison is violent offenders and white collar criminals, and

3119
03:15:05,360 --> 03:15:06,880
you shouldn't be getting out.

3120
03:15:06,880 --> 03:15:10,760
It was a lot less crime in this country back in the 30s and 40s and things.

3121
03:15:10,760 --> 03:15:16,440
When if you did a robbery or something, you're gonna be in jail for ten years, busting rocks.

3122
03:15:16,440 --> 03:15:18,600
Now it's like a college of criminal activity.

3123
03:15:18,600 --> 03:15:23,000
Let's go ahead and go to a Second Amendment right of individuals to own for sport, hunting,

3124
03:15:23,000 --> 03:15:24,000
protection, and collection.

3125
03:15:24,000 --> 03:15:27,320
Notice he had to stick protection in there.

3126
03:15:27,320 --> 03:15:31,440
But how am I gonna protect myself from six or seven gang bangers if I don't have a semi-auto?

3127
03:15:31,440 --> 03:15:34,900
And we've seen those countless videos of store owners and others.

3128
03:15:34,900 --> 03:15:37,920
So this is Obama's version of the Second Amendment, here it is.

3129
03:15:37,920 --> 03:15:42,320
Like most Americans, I believe the Second Amendment guarantees an individual right to

3130
03:15:42,320 --> 03:15:43,800
bear arms.

3131
03:15:43,800 --> 03:15:51,640
I respect our strong tradition of gun ownership and the rights of hunters and sportsmen.

3132
03:15:51,640 --> 03:15:56,840
There are millions of responsible, law-abiding gun owners in America who cherish their right

3133
03:15:56,840 --> 03:16:02,660
to bear arms for hunting or sport or protection or collection.

3134
03:16:02,660 --> 03:16:07,040
Like most Americans, I believe the Second Amendment guarantees an individual right to

3135
03:16:07,040 --> 03:16:08,040
bear arms.

3136
03:16:08,040 --> 03:16:09,440
Hit pause for a moment.

3137
03:16:09,440 --> 03:16:15,040
I respect our strong- The crew was asking me where was the smiling.

3138
03:16:15,040 --> 03:16:16,040
There it was right there.

3139
03:16:16,040 --> 03:16:19,400
I only watched about half of it cuz I was busy talking over it.

3140
03:16:19,400 --> 03:16:22,560
And I turned it off a few times cuz I couldn't listen to it.

3141
03:16:22,560 --> 03:16:26,320
Just while I was watching the continued smirking.

3142
03:16:26,320 --> 03:16:33,080
It's like when you get caught doing something bad and it's funny, and your dad's going,

3143
03:16:33,080 --> 03:16:34,080
I know you did it.

3144
03:16:34,080 --> 03:16:38,280
I know, you know, don't lie and you're going, and it's like funny.

3145
03:16:38,280 --> 03:16:43,620
I mean, this guy could not get the, you know what, eat and grin off his face.

3146
03:16:43,620 --> 03:16:44,920
And the crew was asking me where it's at.

3147
03:16:44,920 --> 03:16:48,860
I saw it like five, six times in just half of it I've watched.

3148
03:16:48,860 --> 03:16:50,080
But I mean, there it is.

3149
03:16:50,080 --> 03:16:51,080
Let's roll that again.

3150
03:16:51,080 --> 03:16:53,360
Here it is.

3151
03:16:53,360 --> 03:16:56,720
He's an individual right to bear arms.

3152
03:16:56,720 --> 03:17:01,640
I respect our strong tradition of gun ownership- Did you see him hold the smile down?

3153
03:17:01,640 --> 03:17:02,640
And the rights of hunters and sportsmen.

3154
03:17:02,640 --> 03:17:06,720
He is so happy, he had to fight- There are millions of responsible law abiding

3155
03:17:06,720 --> 03:17:13,040
gun owners in America who cherish their right to bear arms for hunting, or sport, or protection,

3156
03:17:13,040 --> 03:17:14,040
or collection.

3157
03:17:14,040 --> 03:17:15,040
There goes another smile.

3158
03:17:15,040 --> 03:17:17,320
I mean, this is insane.

3159
03:17:17,320 --> 03:17:22,320
And then he goes on to say at the 1554 Club, I wanna play that one.

3160
03:17:22,320 --> 03:17:26,480
He says, we can respect the Second Amendment while keeping an irresponsible law breaking

3161
03:17:26,480 --> 03:17:29,040
few from inflicting harm on a massive scale.

3162
03:17:29,040 --> 03:17:32,440
Yeah, by arming people in the school.

3163
03:17:32,440 --> 03:17:36,640
The government has psychological profiles to know who's steadfast, who's always been

3164
03:17:36,640 --> 03:17:41,920
to work on time, generally who's got a military style background or an Eagle Scout, people

3165
03:17:41,920 --> 03:17:42,920
that are into duty.

3166
03:17:42,920 --> 03:17:45,720
I mean, I'll tell you who you are, you are the football coaches.

3167
03:17:45,720 --> 03:17:48,960
I mean, this is a no brainer.

3168
03:17:48,960 --> 03:17:54,360
You arm honorable people, obviously the weird science teacher, who everybody knows is a

3169
03:17:54,360 --> 03:17:56,720
perv or whatever.

3170
03:17:56,720 --> 03:18:02,440
And you give them a psychological evaluation, I mean, I'm all for that just cuz you might

3171
03:18:02,440 --> 03:18:04,880
end up getting a crazy someday as a teacher that kills people.

3172
03:18:04,880 --> 03:18:07,760
Plus the kids are so out of control, who knows what will happen, you're getting assaulted.

3173
03:18:07,760 --> 03:18:14,320
My point is to do psychological profiling and arm the teachers, or have retired cops

3174
03:18:14,320 --> 03:18:15,320
who wanna work as janitors.

3175
03:18:15,320 --> 03:18:19,760
Believe it, they would come and be happy to sweep the floors, be undercover and protect

3176
03:18:19,760 --> 03:18:23,600
kids and put a couple of retired cops at every school.

3177
03:18:23,600 --> 03:18:28,280
I mean, I bet you get cops that would do it for free, but you don't wanna do that, you

3178
03:18:28,280 --> 03:18:29,280
wanna just pay them.

3179
03:18:29,280 --> 03:18:33,880
I mean, this is a no brainer, but I don't want the police in there doing the anti-drug

3180
03:18:33,880 --> 03:18:36,000
stuff and harassing people and things.

3181
03:18:36,000 --> 03:18:39,840
Dealing with bullies, things like that's fine, but I guarantee you, they're saying they're

3182
03:18:39,840 --> 03:18:43,200
gonna have federal police in there, we're gonna skip this break coming up.

3183
03:18:43,200 --> 03:18:48,320
I guarantee you, they're gonna just turn this into a federal brainwashing, federal spying,

3184
03:18:48,320 --> 03:18:52,840
federal anti-gun officers, which is actually what they're proposing.

3185
03:18:52,840 --> 03:18:57,400
Instead of arm the teachers, and if the schools are too cowardly to do that, like Texas and

3186
03:18:57,400 --> 03:19:00,080
other states are doing.

3187
03:19:00,080 --> 03:19:04,280
I had that state superintendent on from that Texas town where they're 30 minutes from the

3188
03:19:04,280 --> 03:19:07,120
local police department, but it's a big school out in the country.

3189
03:19:07,120 --> 03:19:12,640
And he said, we saw mass shootings in 2007, and we're not gonna wait 30 minutes, and we're

3190
03:19:12,640 --> 03:19:15,400
not gonna have our teachers illegally carrying guns in principle.

3191
03:19:15,400 --> 03:19:19,200
So we have people that have concealed carry that we do some private training with the

3192
03:19:19,200 --> 03:19:23,040
police and some building clearings tile stuff.

3193
03:19:23,040 --> 03:19:27,600
But the feds don't want that, they want mass shooting training where you go get in a ball.

3194
03:19:27,600 --> 03:19:31,660
And in every mass shooting, a teacher finally knocks the window out and tries to claw out

3195
03:19:31,660 --> 03:19:33,800
the burglar bars to go out the window.

3196
03:19:33,800 --> 03:19:39,940
I mean, if you hear boom, boom, boom shooting, it should be, if you really wanted to be serious

3197
03:19:39,940 --> 03:19:47,840
for something that's still very rare, you would have collapsible stairs, a step ladder

3198
03:19:47,840 --> 03:19:48,840
that was right there.

3199
03:19:48,840 --> 03:19:52,760
And you'd open it and make sure the windows were openable from the inside to go out the

3200
03:19:52,760 --> 03:19:54,760
window.

3201
03:19:54,760 --> 03:19:58,600
We're skipping the break.

3202
03:19:58,600 --> 03:20:08,520
I mean, it is just amazing, absolutely amazing what's going on here.

3203
03:20:08,520 --> 03:20:14,840
I mean, they used to tell people, if you hear a nuclear bomb sirens go off, get under your

3204
03:20:14,840 --> 03:20:15,840
desk.

3205
03:20:15,840 --> 03:20:19,200
And it was just all about creating fear.

3206
03:20:19,200 --> 03:20:22,520
But at least with that, the ceiling might fall on you, that actually might protect you.

3207
03:20:22,520 --> 03:20:25,760
There was some reality there, even though it was done for fair mongering, that was later

3208
03:20:25,760 --> 03:20:28,760
declassified.

3209
03:20:28,760 --> 03:20:37,280
Getting in a ball when someone's coming to kill you is the last thing you wanna do.

3210
03:20:37,280 --> 03:20:41,960
You've seen that lawyer where the guy's trying to kill him and the lawyer's dodging and he's

3211
03:20:41,960 --> 03:20:45,440
getting shot in the arms, but he still gets all the way up on him and then hides behind

3212
03:20:45,440 --> 03:20:46,440
a tree.

3213
03:20:46,440 --> 03:20:52,400
I mean, if you're cornered, you're better to fight than just sit there and be a sitting

3214
03:20:52,400 --> 03:20:54,400
duck.

3215
03:20:54,400 --> 03:21:00,280
I thought that was Remo Williams, remember that movie, Remo Williams, pretty good B movie

3216
03:21:00,280 --> 03:21:07,600
where the guy, yeah, Fred Ward, where the Japanese karate master knows how to dodge

3217
03:21:07,600 --> 03:21:08,600
bullets.

3218
03:21:08,600 --> 03:21:11,440
You've seen that footage of the lawyer, he dodges a bunch of them.

3219
03:21:11,440 --> 03:21:13,440
That guy's got a revolver and he's like dodging it.

3220
03:21:13,440 --> 03:21:17,160
I mean, if somebody pulls a gun on me and I don't have a gun, that's what's gonna happen,

3221
03:21:17,160 --> 03:21:19,120
is that I'm gonna dodge him.

3222
03:21:19,120 --> 03:21:24,120
And if somebody came into my house and I couldn't get to a gun or a restaurant, I guarantee

3223
03:21:24,120 --> 03:21:28,600
you without thinking I would go throw myself at them, just like Susanna Hupp's dad did

3224
03:21:28,600 --> 03:21:30,640
in that Luby saving a bunch of people.

3225
03:21:30,640 --> 03:21:35,360
Not because I'm a hero, folks, you couldn't control me.

3226
03:21:35,360 --> 03:21:38,480
And I just don't know how we've gotten to the point where a lot of people just kneel

3227
03:21:38,480 --> 03:21:39,480
down.

3228
03:21:39,480 --> 03:21:42,240
You're shooting people and they just, you're shooting them in a row?

3229
03:21:42,240 --> 03:21:44,560
Let me just get ready and put my head down.

3230
03:21:44,560 --> 03:21:46,960
Let me put my head down while you shoot me.

3231
03:21:46,960 --> 03:21:50,520
I mean, where is the survival instinct?

3232
03:21:50,520 --> 03:21:53,520
Every mammal I know.

3233
03:21:53,520 --> 03:21:58,360
I remember I was about five, six years old, my grandmother had these mousetraps out for

3234
03:21:58,360 --> 03:22:01,320
mice and rats out in the country they were getting in the house.

3235
03:22:01,320 --> 03:22:04,240
And I never even told them about this story, cuz it didn't really even break the flesh,

3236
03:22:04,240 --> 03:22:05,240
like partially did.

3237
03:22:05,240 --> 03:22:08,280
I was like three, four, five, I don't remember how old I was, it was real little.

3238
03:22:08,280 --> 03:22:11,560
It was on the back porch and there was a bucket and there was a rat in it.

3239
03:22:11,560 --> 03:22:13,560
It had fallen in the bucket, it was trying to get out.

3240
03:22:13,560 --> 03:22:15,940
And I wanted to be nice and help him get out.

3241
03:22:15,940 --> 03:22:19,160
And I reached in there and that rat bit me.

3242
03:22:19,160 --> 03:22:23,240
One time a honeybee was in the baby pool and I wanted to say that it stung me and I really

3243
03:22:23,240 --> 03:22:24,240
cried.

3244
03:22:24,240 --> 03:22:26,720
My dad said, it was one of my first memories, I was about two and a half, cuz I wanted to

3245
03:22:26,720 --> 03:22:29,800
help the bee and it stung me, I didn't know why it was mean to me.

3246
03:22:29,800 --> 03:22:36,080
But the point is, is that a rat will bite you, a raccoon will bite you, a dog will bite

3247
03:22:36,080 --> 03:22:44,040
you, a seal will bite you, a woodchuck will bite you, a otter will bite you, a wildcat

3248
03:22:44,040 --> 03:22:50,160
will bite you, a puma will bite you, a cow will bite you and head bite you.

3249
03:22:50,160 --> 03:22:54,880
A bunny rabbit will bite you, a deer will bite and kick you.

3250
03:22:54,880 --> 03:22:59,960
Every mammal fights back, it's automatic if you're cornered.

3251
03:22:59,960 --> 03:23:04,040
And they're trying to take our basic instinct of defending ourselves away.

3252
03:23:04,040 --> 03:23:12,960
And that's why they hate the gun culture because it's helping us redevelop and rediscover that.

3253
03:23:12,960 --> 03:23:19,180
Let's go to this bizarre 1647 clip, pundits saying it's all about all out assault by tyrants

3254
03:23:19,180 --> 03:23:20,320
on liberty.

3255
03:23:20,320 --> 03:23:23,100
Let's go to Obama responding to his critics, here it is.

3256
03:23:23,100 --> 03:23:25,780
This will be difficult.

3257
03:23:25,780 --> 03:23:30,200
There will be pundits and politicians and special interest lobbyists publicly warning

3258
03:23:30,200 --> 03:23:35,520
of a tyrannical all out assault on liberty.

3259
03:23:35,520 --> 03:23:44,300
Not because that's true, but because they want to gin up fear or higher ratings or revenue

3260
03:23:44,300 --> 03:23:45,300
for themselves.

3261
03:23:45,300 --> 03:23:47,820
Oh, I wonder who you're talking about, punk.

3262
03:23:47,820 --> 03:23:52,640
And behind the scenes, they'll do everything they can to block any common sense reform

3263
03:23:52,640 --> 03:23:55,240
and make sure nothing changes whatsoever.

3264
03:23:55,240 --> 03:23:57,240
Yeah.

3265
03:23:57,240 --> 03:24:02,520
The only way we will be able to change is if their audience, their constituents, their

3266
03:24:02,520 --> 03:24:06,240
members- Let's stop right there.

3267
03:24:06,240 --> 03:24:08,200
That is a profound statement.

3268
03:24:08,200 --> 03:24:11,400
And he's thinking about Alex Jones.

3269
03:24:11,400 --> 03:24:13,680
He's thinking about Matt Drudge.

3270
03:24:13,680 --> 03:24:15,960
He's thinking about Glenn Beck.

3271
03:24:15,960 --> 03:24:21,040
He's thinking about Larry Pratt, Wayne LaPierre.

3272
03:24:21,040 --> 03:24:25,240
I mean, guaranteed, cuz the White House has responded to me before.

3273
03:24:25,240 --> 03:24:28,760
And it's come out that Homeland Security's got files on Matt Drudge and Alex Jones and

3274
03:24:28,760 --> 03:24:29,760
all this stuff.

3275
03:24:29,760 --> 03:24:33,360
And there's been lawsuits over, but they won't release them by InfraGard, that's a board

3276
03:24:33,360 --> 03:24:36,840
member of the NRA, Bob Barr, former congressman.

3277
03:24:36,840 --> 03:24:41,800
I mean, they're talking about us, cuz that's incredible.

3278
03:24:41,800 --> 03:24:47,600
While they're up there, they know we know they're crooks.

3279
03:24:47,600 --> 03:24:52,840
I mean, these people shipped 20,000 plus guns into Mexico.

3280
03:24:52,840 --> 03:24:57,160
The gun dealers allowing guns to walk under ATF orders, that's just the least of it, so

3281
03:24:57,160 --> 03:24:59,520
the media focused on that to divert.

3282
03:24:59,520 --> 03:25:00,700
They shipped hand grenades.

3283
03:25:00,700 --> 03:25:05,760
They had the US Army get weapons down there, 18 wheelers, rocket launchers, to try to just

3284
03:25:05,760 --> 03:25:10,920
wreck Mexico so they could then say there's a bunch of US guns doing it to blame our Second

3285
03:25:10,920 --> 03:25:11,920
Amendment.

3286
03:25:11,920 --> 03:25:14,200
And again, that all came out.

3287
03:25:14,200 --> 03:25:15,920
You know how gangster that is?

3288
03:25:15,920 --> 03:25:20,860
That is a false flag.

3289
03:25:20,860 --> 03:25:26,640
And they're doing the same thing right now.

3290
03:25:26,640 --> 03:25:29,960
And I'm gonna be honest with you, again, I didn't watch that full speech, and I was only

3291
03:25:29,960 --> 03:25:30,960
reading these quotes.

3292
03:25:30,960 --> 03:25:32,360
That was a stunning quote.

3293
03:25:32,360 --> 03:25:34,520
We're gonna do overdrive the whole hour.

3294
03:25:34,520 --> 03:25:37,880
Guys, back that back up for me if you can, and I know you've moved to the next clip.

3295
03:25:37,880 --> 03:25:41,100
I wanna go back to 1647, that is just stunning.

3296
03:25:41,100 --> 03:25:45,920
And you can see him holding back his mafia smirk, hey, that Goodfella business, Biden

3297
03:25:45,920 --> 03:25:50,040
might work for you in New York and Chicago and places, okay, nothing against New Yorkers

3298
03:25:50,040 --> 03:25:51,040
or Chicagoans.

3299
03:25:51,040 --> 03:25:55,080
They're great people, but because they've been such wealthy areas, the criminals all

3300
03:25:55,080 --> 03:25:57,720
ran there and they've run your areas for 100 years.

3301
03:25:57,720 --> 03:26:04,000
I mean, all that Goodfella crud and your shark skin suits and all that may intimidate people.

3302
03:26:04,000 --> 03:26:07,600
And you may think it's funny to sit there with your, I mean, they look like Robert DeNiro

3303
03:26:07,600 --> 03:26:09,200
and Goodfellas.

3304
03:26:09,200 --> 03:26:10,400
Great Martin Scorsese movie.

3305
03:26:10,400 --> 03:26:14,120
I watched it again, it's a true story, with my wife Saturday night.

3306
03:26:14,120 --> 03:26:20,320
And that same fake confidence makes my blood literally boil.

3307
03:26:20,320 --> 03:26:25,520
And they cannot stand the fact that I got up there and said, you wanna take our guns,

3308
03:26:25,520 --> 03:26:26,520
you wanna enslave us.

3309
03:26:26,520 --> 03:26:29,040
And that was the number one story in the country for two days.

3310
03:26:29,040 --> 03:26:37,320
They were talking about Alex Jones first and foremost.

3311
03:26:37,320 --> 03:26:41,520
That's why we need your prayers, because they go, you're discredited, you're yelling at

3312
03:26:41,520 --> 03:26:43,080
us, you're calling us criminals.

3313
03:26:43,080 --> 03:26:44,400
That's not a real debate.

3314
03:26:44,400 --> 03:26:46,840
You're not a real person having a real debate.

3315
03:26:46,840 --> 03:26:52,020
You're not like my neighbor coming over and going, hey, we don't have enough land to have

3316
03:26:52,020 --> 03:26:53,440
an agriculture exemption.

3317
03:26:53,440 --> 03:26:58,040
But if we combine together and get an agriculture exemption, we can get off on our taxes.

3318
03:26:58,040 --> 03:27:02,960
If we put honeybees on it or maybe a cow or two, how's that sound?

3319
03:27:02,960 --> 03:27:03,960
You wanna do that?

3320
03:27:03,960 --> 03:27:04,960
Man, that's a really good idea.

3321
03:27:04,960 --> 03:27:06,240
Yeah, that'll lower our taxes massively.

3322
03:27:06,240 --> 03:27:10,600
I've been so busy, I really haven't had time to go talk to you, I'm glad you reached out

3323
03:27:10,600 --> 03:27:11,600
to do that.

3324
03:27:11,600 --> 03:27:12,600
Yeah, let's do that.

3325
03:27:12,600 --> 03:27:15,800
I waited so long, the neighbor went ahead and just bought some more properties they

3326
03:27:15,800 --> 03:27:16,800
could do it, but they're still nice enough.

3327
03:27:16,800 --> 03:27:19,320
I'm gonna talk to them, but let me merge in with them.

3328
03:27:19,320 --> 03:27:22,360
But the point is, that's a negotiation, that's a good faith.

3329
03:27:22,360 --> 03:27:31,000
I'm talking to my neighbor, hey, how you doing there, Jesse, or whoever the neighbor is,

3330
03:27:31,000 --> 03:27:32,120
how are you doing today?

3331
03:27:32,120 --> 03:27:36,640
Let's talk about, as regular people, nice calm voices, hey, come on in and have a cup

3332
03:27:36,640 --> 03:27:38,200
of coffee.

3333
03:27:38,200 --> 03:27:42,480
When somebody is a known liar, telling me they don't want my guns when they're sworn

3334
03:27:42,480 --> 03:27:43,720
to get them.

3335
03:27:43,720 --> 03:27:48,200
And there are a bunch of crooks that cause mass murder in Mexico and the US Southwest

3336
03:27:48,200 --> 03:27:52,680
to blame the Second Amendment and scapegoat gun owners and use a bunch of dead Mexican

3337
03:27:52,680 --> 03:27:53,680
kids.

3338
03:27:53,680 --> 03:27:57,320
Mexico has press conferences, Calderon did it, we gotta do a piece on that.

3339
03:27:57,320 --> 03:28:02,200
He got a bunch of Mexican kids around him and said, America, we ban your guns, it's

3340
03:28:02,200 --> 03:28:03,200
your fault.

3341
03:28:03,200 --> 03:28:07,680
I mean, it's the most ridiculous script, and the White House did it, and the guy that did

3342
03:28:07,680 --> 03:28:13,360
it, killing thousands of people and hundreds of children, is trying to blame you and I

3343
03:28:13,360 --> 03:28:14,360
for it.

3344
03:28:14,360 --> 03:28:18,720
And then we get angry and they go, you're discredited, and only the sheep go, yeah,

3345
03:28:18,720 --> 03:28:20,280
you're discredited when you get angry.

3346
03:28:20,280 --> 03:28:29,080
But when they go have rallies with Cuomo and gangsters like the godfather of Chicago, Emanuel,

3347
03:28:29,080 --> 03:28:33,040
they start going, we're gonna do it, yeah, yeah, we're gonna get the guns.

3348
03:28:33,040 --> 03:28:38,040
But with us, no, don't get excited, hold on, you just sit right there and you take a deep

3349
03:28:38,040 --> 03:28:41,520
breath and you calm down and you're discredited, okay?

3350
03:28:41,520 --> 03:28:46,340
But you notice the president in his press conference, what did he say?

3351
03:28:46,340 --> 03:28:49,580
He said, there are gonna be people saying this is tyranny, there are gonna be people

3352
03:28:49,580 --> 03:28:50,920
saying the government's evil.

3353
03:28:50,920 --> 03:28:56,880
And he does this little gangster satisfaction, he's not even a good liar now, he goes, and

3354
03:28:56,880 --> 03:29:03,640
they're lying, they're wrong, I mean, that is the most incredible thing, the President

3355
03:29:03,640 --> 03:29:10,480
of the United States is directly responding to us, there's no doubt, no doubt.

3356
03:29:10,480 --> 03:29:17,120
And I've entered this insane vortex where I've got all these pundits on, and they're

3357
03:29:17,120 --> 03:29:21,400
saying, yeah, Alex, you're pretty much the most prominent voice now, I didn't even want

3358
03:29:21,400 --> 03:29:22,400
that.

3359
03:29:22,400 --> 03:29:27,920
I mean, this is creepville on steroids, cuz let me tell you, I'm a macho guy and I don't

3360
03:29:27,920 --> 03:29:34,000
like tyrants, but I gotta be honest, it is creepy to have the president responding to

3361
03:29:34,000 --> 03:29:35,000
you.

3362
03:29:35,000 --> 03:29:37,560
And let me tell you, they're thinking about a group of people there, but right in the

3363
03:29:37,560 --> 03:29:42,240
middle is me, I mean, he's thinking about a group of people.

3364
03:29:42,240 --> 03:29:48,920
And cuz it's come out that we're in their internal stuff, but I mean, it's just unbelievable,

3365
03:29:48,920 --> 03:29:50,600
that criminal now responding to me.

3366
03:29:50,600 --> 03:29:57,760
We're on the march, the empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

3367
03:29:57,760 --> 03:30:07,760
Hello, I'm Alex Jones, myself, my family, the Infowars.com team want to relay to you

3368
03:30:07,760 --> 03:30:13,040

3369
03:30:13,040 --> 03:30:14,040
front.

3375
03:30:35,520 --> 03:30:41,760
They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.

3376
03:30:41,760 --> 03:30:49,200
You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization

3377
03:30:49,200 --> 03:30:50,680
and ultimate extermination.

3378
03:30:50,680 --> 03:30:53,080
The war is here.

3379
03:30:53,080 --> 03:30:54,960

than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood

sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?

them.

3400
03:32:16,840 --> 03:32:18,320
It's called heart and body extract.

3401
03:32:18,320 --> 03:32:22,680
Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract, talks about the positive effects

3402
03:32:22,680 --> 03:32:24,160
of heart and body extract.

3403
03:32:24,160 --> 03:32:28,400
What happens with the formula heart and body extract is it's giving the body the necessary

3404
03:32:28,400 --> 03:32:34,160
vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.

3405
03:32:34,160 --> 03:32:38,720
And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol,

3406
03:32:38,720 --> 03:32:40,080
clean and unclog the arteries.

3407
03:32:40,080 --> 03:32:44,160
It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetic stuff.

3408
03:32:44,160 --> 03:32:46,000
The body is an amazing thing.

3409
03:32:46,000 --> 03:32:49,260

3413
03:33:26,720 --> 03:33:33,960
What these psycho dungeon keepers really like is putting innocent people in jails.

3414
03:33:33,960 --> 03:33:38,760
You know, when freedom fails, the best men rot in filthy jails and those that cried appease

3415
03:33:38,760 --> 03:33:44,040
appease are hung by those they tried to please.

3416
03:33:44,040 --> 03:33:45,040
I'm not afraid of dying.

3417
03:33:45,040 --> 03:33:47,400
I don't want to be locked up in one of their dungeons, man.

3418
03:33:47,400 --> 03:33:50,160
If they ever lock me up in one of their dungeons, I'm innocent.

3419
03:33:50,160 --> 03:33:51,160
Get me out.

3420
03:33:51,160 --> 03:33:52,160
Oh, man.

3421
03:33:52,160 --> 03:33:56,080
Again, I hadn't seen the whole speech.

3422
03:33:56,080 --> 03:33:59,680
I was reading over the transcripts and now we're playing clips of it and the whole crew

3423
03:33:59,680 --> 03:34:00,920
said they were back there having lunch.

3424
03:34:00,920 --> 03:34:04,760
Well, part of the crew, the TV crew, they said, no, no, we knew they were talking about

3425
03:34:04,760 --> 03:34:07,520
you because obviously I came out saying it's tyranny.

3426
03:34:07,520 --> 03:34:09,120
It's a takeover last week.

3427
03:34:09,120 --> 03:34:10,200
That was the big story.

3428
03:34:10,200 --> 03:34:16,800
The White House responded at the end of Piers Morgan to my petition and denied it as if

3429
03:34:16,800 --> 03:34:19,720
they could have ever deported him because I asked anyways.

3430
03:34:19,720 --> 03:34:23,200
We were just showing how your whole petition's a fraud anyways.

3431
03:34:23,200 --> 03:34:24,200
You're not a dictator.

3432
03:34:24,200 --> 03:34:26,040
You're trying to be one.

3433
03:34:26,040 --> 03:34:29,840
Any country where you give a petition to the president and they can do whatever they want,

3434
03:34:29,840 --> 03:34:32,680
that's not called a president, it's called a dictator.

3435
03:34:32,680 --> 03:34:37,160
And by the way, Rand Paul, two congressmen, more congressmen, they're calling him a dictator,

3436
03:34:37,160 --> 03:34:38,160
a king.

3437
03:34:38,160 --> 03:34:41,360
They're talking about impeachment and they're talking about how they're gonna impeach him.

3438
03:34:41,360 --> 03:34:42,480
Let's go.

3439
03:34:42,480 --> 03:34:45,280
It's not, hey, if you keep pushing, we're gonna impeach you.

3440
03:34:45,280 --> 03:34:50,400
We've got a grandstander up there telling us it's our fault when more kids get killed

3441
03:34:50,400 --> 03:34:53,560
when they're the ones trying to block armed guards in the schools.

3442
03:34:53,560 --> 03:34:54,560
Remember that?

3443
03:34:54,560 --> 03:34:59,360
And he's trying to get the people organized to overthrow their own Bill of Rights and

3444
03:34:59,360 --> 03:35:00,360
Constitution.

3445
03:35:00,360 --> 03:35:02,360
That is sedition.

3446
03:35:02,360 --> 03:35:08,400
He is trying to turn all of our cities into crime-ridden, mafia-dawn areas like he controls,

3447
03:35:08,400 --> 03:35:11,840
and we don't want any part of it.

3448
03:35:11,840 --> 03:35:17,240
White House now requires we the people petitions to have 100,000 signatures for official response.

3449
03:35:17,240 --> 03:35:20,760
Yeah, well, they responded to the states' rights ones that had hundreds of thousands

3450
03:35:20,760 --> 03:35:22,880
and he said, no, there are no states.

3451
03:35:22,880 --> 03:35:23,880
I am your Supreme Leader.

3452
03:35:23,880 --> 03:35:27,080
All right, I wanna go to your phone calls, but let's play this clip again.

3453
03:35:27,080 --> 03:35:30,040
Pundits saying it's all about assault by tyrants.

3454
03:35:30,040 --> 03:35:36,160
I mean, Obama brought in unconstitutional Obamacare openly.

3455
03:35:36,160 --> 03:35:45,380
Hey, guys, will you come, hold on one second, man, will you come, guys, talk to this Canadian

3456
03:35:45,380 --> 03:35:48,320
TV thing cuz I'm doing overdrive and just set me up for Skype.

3457
03:35:48,320 --> 03:35:49,320
Ma'am, hold on one second.

3458
03:35:49,320 --> 03:35:50,320
Here you go.

3459
03:35:50,320 --> 03:35:54,640
I mean, they just all have gotten my cell phone number somehow, they're just calling

3460
03:35:54,640 --> 03:35:58,000
and calling and BBC's on there too.

3461
03:35:58,000 --> 03:36:00,800
And then Good Morning America's on there, I never even told you this morning about it.

3462
03:36:00,800 --> 03:36:04,760
So I gotta deal with that, I gotta get more producers, more people, they're working hard

3463
03:36:04,760 --> 03:36:05,760
in there.

3464
03:36:05,760 --> 03:36:07,600
There's just too much going on.

3465
03:36:07,600 --> 03:36:08,600
What was I getting into?

3466
03:36:08,600 --> 03:36:12,000
I told, yeah, pundits, we're gonna play pundits.

3467
03:36:12,000 --> 03:36:15,340
I know there's gonna be idiots on YouTube in places that aren't listening to the radio

3468
03:36:15,340 --> 03:36:16,920
or not watching us on prisonplanet.tv.

3469
03:36:16,920 --> 03:36:21,320
Look at this crazy guy, he says the White House is responding to him.

3470
03:36:21,320 --> 03:36:27,600
They responded to my petition and said they were watching Piers Morgan, Jay Carney did.

3471
03:36:27,600 --> 03:36:29,200
That's the White House press secretary.

3472
03:36:29,200 --> 03:36:34,660
Myself, Matt Drudge and others have come out that Homeland Security has files on us just

3473
03:36:34,660 --> 03:36:36,600
for our covering the TSA.

3474
03:36:36,600 --> 03:36:40,660
Big Sis has responded and talked about Matt Drudge, the White House has.

3475
03:36:40,660 --> 03:36:46,800
We have the tens of millions of listeners and viewers and readers.

3476
03:36:46,800 --> 03:36:52,280
Piers Morgan has half a million until I went on his show and went up to a million.

3477
03:36:52,280 --> 03:36:54,240
And then tens of millions cuz it was aired everywhere else.

3478
03:36:54,240 --> 03:37:02,600
I mean, it's an illusion that the president is a nobody punk, he's not our president.

3479
03:37:02,600 --> 03:37:06,320
And then they try this just cuz you're racist folks, if there was a black guy that was like

3480
03:37:06,320 --> 03:37:08,920
George Washington, I'd wash his feet.

3481
03:37:08,920 --> 03:37:14,360
I'm so sick of what color people are, I don't care about their hearts and their minds, the

3482
03:37:14,360 --> 03:37:15,760
character of their deeds.

3483
03:37:15,760 --> 03:37:19,520
And I'm sick of these racists standing behind a race, they're not even racist though, they

3484
03:37:19,520 --> 03:37:22,040
use it to manipulate.

3485
03:37:22,040 --> 03:37:25,440
And Obama is a clear and present danger to this republic.

3486
03:37:25,440 --> 03:37:30,840
And I'm saying second American Revolution, peaceful secession, boom, people are listening.

3487
03:37:30,840 --> 03:37:35,160
I'm saying it's time to impeach his butt, okay?

3488
03:37:35,160 --> 03:37:39,480
And he's responding to us and they are hacking our site and doing every dirty trick you can

3489
03:37:39,480 --> 03:37:40,480
imagine.

3490
03:37:40,480 --> 03:37:47,320
We need people to help us, if they bring infowars.com down, it doesn't matter, we'll just set up

3491
03:37:47,320 --> 03:37:51,480
alternate backup sites and we'll get our news out one way or the other.

3492
03:37:51,480 --> 03:37:54,720
You're not gonna stop any of us, okay?

3493
03:37:54,720 --> 03:37:58,000
But if these are sophisticated, obviously governmental things going on, I'm not gonna

3494
03:37:58,000 --> 03:37:59,480
get into the nature of them.

3495
03:37:59,480 --> 03:38:03,360
I saw there's one a piggyback on the exploitations, but it is not fun.

3496
03:38:03,360 --> 03:38:07,080
And we have people up 24 hours a day, we're gonna put more on the job and it'll just make

3497
03:38:07,080 --> 03:38:09,720
us stronger by the grace of God.

3498
03:38:09,720 --> 03:38:14,140
But they're mad, because no one will call them what they are, low down gangster thug

3499
03:38:14,140 --> 03:38:18,840
criminals and waging war against our Bill of Rights and Constitution.

3500
03:38:18,840 --> 03:38:23,720
Putting us under UN command, passing Obamacare, raising taxes on poor people.

3501
03:38:23,720 --> 03:38:29,960
Man, I tell you, that makes me these helpless, sad, a lot of people laugh at these Obama

3502
03:38:29,960 --> 03:38:34,440
noise and I've done it to myself cuz it's funny.

3503
03:38:34,440 --> 03:38:36,160
It's funny cuz they sound funny.

3504
03:38:36,160 --> 03:38:39,200
I told the Obama lady, I said, you sound like a Muppet.

3505
03:38:39,200 --> 03:38:42,200
I said, I have laughed at you, but I care about you as a human.

3506
03:38:42,200 --> 03:38:44,000
I don't know if I should laugh or cry.

3507
03:38:44,000 --> 03:38:48,040
And then I showed her how he lied and said he wouldn't raise taxes and how he lied and

3508
03:38:48,040 --> 03:38:49,040
said he wouldn't come after the gun.

3509
03:38:49,040 --> 03:38:51,560
She goes, wow, I never saw that, he is a liar.

3510
03:38:51,560 --> 03:38:56,160
And my whole point is I want her to have a future, I want her to have a country, I want

3511
03:38:56,160 --> 03:39:01,920
her to be free, I care about her soul, her mind.

3512
03:39:01,920 --> 03:39:04,400
And the media just says, no, you're racist if you don't vote for Obama.

3513
03:39:04,400 --> 03:39:07,800
I mean, it's just such a dumbed down, how obvious does it have to get?

3514
03:39:07,800 --> 03:39:11,160
Here's the kids, I'm high-fiving, I'm gonna get the guns for you kids.

3515
03:39:11,160 --> 03:39:15,240
The kids said, you're against the little five-year-old if you don't give me my guns.

3516
03:39:15,240 --> 03:39:18,640
But I'm not, I'm not a tyrant.

3517
03:39:18,640 --> 03:39:23,000
There's no tyranny, there's nothing wrong going on anywhere.

3518
03:39:23,000 --> 03:39:27,280
I mean, this is insane.

3519
03:39:27,280 --> 03:39:33,080
They are attacking me and others because we're aggressive.

3520
03:39:33,080 --> 03:39:35,400
And they wanna just normalize all this tyranny.

3521
03:39:35,400 --> 03:39:37,560
Let's go to this clip one more time, here it is.

3522
03:39:37,560 --> 03:39:40,240
This will be difficult.

3523
03:39:40,240 --> 03:39:44,660
There will be pundits and politicians and special interest lobbyists publicly warning

3524
03:39:44,660 --> 03:39:49,960
of a tyrannical all-out assault on liberty.

3525
03:39:49,960 --> 03:39:58,760
Not because that's true, but because they wanna gin up fear or higher ratings or revenue

3526
03:39:58,760 --> 03:40:02,280
for themselves.

3527
03:40:02,280 --> 03:40:07,080
And behind the scenes, they'll do everything they can to block any common sense reform

3528
03:40:07,080 --> 03:40:09,240
and make sure nothing changes whatsoever.

3529
03:40:09,240 --> 03:40:11,680
No, that's not true.

3530
03:40:11,680 --> 03:40:17,000
The only way we will be able to change is if their audience, their constituents, their

3531
03:40:17,000 --> 03:40:22,600
membership says this time must be different.

3532
03:40:22,600 --> 03:40:31,700
And that's what they call it, now is the time and his executive orders that are now out.

3533
03:40:31,700 --> 03:40:35,080
Up there with those dead kids trying to blame gun owners for it.

3534
03:40:35,080 --> 03:40:38,300
And we've said, don't make schools victim disarmament zones.

3535
03:40:38,300 --> 03:40:46,080
We've said, get people off these Prozac type drugs that 20% of the country's on roughly.

3536
03:40:46,080 --> 03:40:50,440
Don't have the federal government demand that foster kids be put on psychotropics, 67% of

3537
03:40:50,440 --> 03:40:51,440
them.

3538
03:40:51,440 --> 03:40:54,840
I mean, they know the vaccines are killing people, it's on the inserts, they can kill

3539
03:40:54,840 --> 03:40:55,840
you.

3540
03:40:55,840 --> 03:40:59,120
And they get on the news and go, there are no side effects, that's a conspiracy theory.

3541
03:40:59,120 --> 03:41:01,440
I've shown you news clips, I've shown you news articles.

3542
03:41:01,440 --> 03:41:04,360
These people do not care about you.

3543
03:41:04,360 --> 03:41:10,360
And he represents Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan.

3544
03:41:10,360 --> 03:41:12,920
We've got to start a protest, those guys start pulling money out of them.

3545
03:41:12,920 --> 03:41:16,480
I guess that's the answer is just go after the banks.

3546
03:41:16,480 --> 03:41:19,300
The foreign banks, I mean, I guess that's it, he's just their agent.

3547
03:41:19,300 --> 03:41:23,020
And they've taken the country over by fraud and now they don't want us armed to ever be

3548
03:41:23,020 --> 03:41:26,080
able to get our country back because they're planning real tyranny.

3549
03:41:26,080 --> 03:41:29,960
They want those guns so bad because they're in a race before everything collapses.

3550
03:41:29,960 --> 03:41:34,040
Because if it all collapses, they'll use it to be able to take over and get control.

3551
03:41:34,040 --> 03:41:38,840
But if we have guns and fight off the roving hordes of welfare people burning things, that

3552
03:41:38,840 --> 03:41:40,760
won't play into their hands, will it?

3553
03:41:40,760 --> 03:41:44,880
So they've got to get guns demonized so they can have cover to wage their homeland security

3554
03:41:44,880 --> 03:41:49,080
war on gun owners, and that's the plan.

3555
03:41:49,080 --> 03:41:55,040
The NSA, the whole homeland security system and giant anti-gun checkpoints, and that's

3556
03:41:55,040 --> 03:41:59,040
what these federally funded quote gang checkpoints are all over the country.

3557
03:41:59,040 --> 03:42:01,440
Texas is heading it up, totally unconstitutional.

3558
03:42:01,440 --> 03:42:06,360
But see, Texas thinks conservative means police state, no, it means the opposite.

3559
03:42:06,360 --> 03:42:10,080
So they're like, well, yeah, we have crimes, we're gonna have checkpoints to look for gang

3560
03:42:10,080 --> 03:42:11,080
members.

3561
03:42:11,080 --> 03:42:12,080
No, it's just a search our cars.

3562
03:42:12,080 --> 03:42:15,180
You know where the gang members are, I can take it to them right now selling crack cocaine

3563
03:42:15,180 --> 03:42:16,180
five miles from here.

3564
03:42:16,180 --> 03:42:19,920
Let's go to a few more clubs than your calls.

3565
03:42:19,920 --> 03:42:25,260
Let's just say I can't just be the usual suspects.

3566
03:42:25,260 --> 03:42:29,040
Let's play that club, here it is.

3567
03:42:29,040 --> 03:42:30,040
That's 18-

3568
03:42:30,040 --> 03:42:34,840
We are responsible for each other.

3569
03:42:34,840 --> 03:42:36,400
It's okay, go ahead and play that one.

3570
03:42:36,400 --> 03:42:37,400
It's all right, guys.

3571
03:42:37,400 --> 03:42:38,400
I know we got a bunch of clips here.

3572
03:42:38,400 --> 03:42:40,400
We are responsible for each other.

3573
03:42:40,400 --> 03:42:49,800
Okay, do you wanna play 18-12 now or, got a whole bunch of clips there in our primitive

3574
03:42:49,800 --> 03:42:50,800
computers.

3575
03:42:50,800 --> 03:42:55,600
Well, it just says 18-12, I can't just pass the usual suspects, we've got them highlighted

3576
03:42:55,600 --> 03:42:56,600
right here.

3577
03:42:56,600 --> 03:42:58,400
I was just going off the ones I highlighted.

3578
03:42:58,400 --> 03:43:00,360
It doesn't matter, hey, that's great.

3579
03:43:00,360 --> 03:43:02,360
Which one can we go to next?

3580
03:43:02,360 --> 03:43:09,760
Okay, well, let's just go ahead and play the next clip, yeah, let's go ahead and play it.

3581
03:43:09,760 --> 03:43:13,920
Soon as I'm finished speaking here, I will sit at that desk and I will sign a directive

3582
03:43:13,920 --> 03:43:20,000
giving law enforcement, schools, mental health professionals, and the public health community

3583
03:43:20,000 --> 03:43:24,840
some of the tools they need to help reduce gun violence.

3584
03:43:24,840 --> 03:43:28,580
We will make it easier to keep guns out of the hands of criminals by strengthening the

3585
03:43:28,580 --> 03:43:31,520
background check system.

3586
03:43:31,520 --> 03:43:37,920
We will help schools hire more resource officers if they want them and develop emergency preparedness

3587
03:43:37,920 --> 03:43:39,980
plans.

3588
03:43:39,980 --> 03:43:43,720
We will make sure mental health professionals know their options for reporting threats of

3589
03:43:43,720 --> 03:43:48,760
violence even as we acknowledge that someone with a mental illness is far more likely to

3590
03:43:48,760 --> 03:43:51,160
be a victim of violent crime than the perpetrator.

3591
03:43:51,160 --> 03:43:53,520
All right, let's stop right there.

3592
03:43:53,520 --> 03:43:57,880
Their main mission is to say everybody's mentally ill, or get you on welfare, or get you in

3593
03:43:57,880 --> 03:44:01,840
the criminal justice system to say now you don't have your rights and make you a slave

3594
03:44:01,840 --> 03:44:02,840
of the state.

3595
03:44:02,840 --> 03:44:06,240
This is just modern forms of slavery.

3596
03:44:06,240 --> 03:44:10,520
They know exactly what they're doing and they exempt themselves from all their garbage.

3597
03:44:10,520 --> 03:44:14,040
They've got get out of jail free cards, literally.

3598
03:44:14,040 --> 03:44:17,440
Congress gets caught insider trading, they go, guess what, we'll pass a law to make it

3599
03:44:17,440 --> 03:44:18,440
illegal.

3600
03:44:18,440 --> 03:44:19,440
It was already illegal.

3601
03:44:19,440 --> 03:44:28,880
Then the law they pass legalizes them insider trading if the House or Senate Ethics Committee

3602
03:44:28,880 --> 03:44:34,000
run by some of the worst offenders, it's like, well, if the other fox says that I'm allowed

3603
03:44:34,000 --> 03:44:35,680
to go eat the hens, it's okay.

3604
03:44:35,680 --> 03:44:40,600
It'd be like Stalin saying, well, if the Politburo says I can kill 10 million Ukrainians, I can,

3605
03:44:40,600 --> 03:44:41,600
that makes it legal.

3606
03:44:41,600 --> 03:44:46,960
Or it'd be like Heinrich Himmler saying, well, we can kill all these people in death camps

3607
03:44:46,960 --> 03:44:49,880
if Hitler says it's okay.

3608
03:44:49,880 --> 03:44:54,640
Mr Hitler of Der Fuehrer, can you sign this order to make it all legal?

3609
03:44:54,640 --> 03:44:58,320
Mr President, can you sign this order for drone attacks to legally bomb countries and

3610
03:44:58,320 --> 03:45:00,680
kill innocent people?

3611
03:45:00,680 --> 03:45:05,320
You signed the order, you didn't have authority, you say NATO gave it to you, not Congress.

3612
03:45:05,320 --> 03:45:08,000
Okay, they're our boss now.

3613
03:45:08,000 --> 03:45:10,400
One more clip, one more clip.

3614
03:45:10,400 --> 03:45:12,140
This is really creepy collectivism.

3615
03:45:12,140 --> 03:45:15,240
You heard, we have rights to be safe in our schools.

3616
03:45:15,240 --> 03:45:17,480
We have rights to be safe in our churches.

3617
03:45:17,480 --> 03:45:22,320
We have rights to be safe in Chicago, where we've taken all the guns and the mafia runs

3618
03:45:22,320 --> 03:45:23,320
things.

3619
03:45:23,320 --> 03:45:25,320
I didn't mean to say that.

3620
03:45:25,320 --> 03:45:30,800
See, it's this collectivism where you as a group of gun owners, you are responsible for

3621
03:45:30,800 --> 03:45:31,800
the dead kids.

3622
03:45:31,800 --> 03:45:35,720
And he's had his pundits come out and say that, and that makes me mad.

3623
03:45:35,720 --> 03:45:41,960
They're trying to guilt me into giving up my rights when he's nothing but a lowdown

3624
03:45:41,960 --> 03:45:42,960
criminal.

3625
03:45:42,960 --> 03:45:45,680
And again, I've listed the articles of impeachment.

3626
03:45:45,680 --> 03:45:50,920
He is a criminal, and I've listed the proof at infoawards.com.

3627
03:45:50,920 --> 03:45:53,060
We are responsible for each other.

3628
03:45:53,060 --> 03:45:57,040
Listen to this weirdness now, this stazzy state they're announcing, where everybody's

3629
03:45:57,040 --> 03:45:59,520
spying and cuddling, and it's collective.

3630
03:45:59,520 --> 03:46:03,360
We're all in socialist healthcare now, so you're not allowed to eat that steak cuz I

3631
03:46:03,360 --> 03:46:04,840
gotta pay for your healthcare.

3632
03:46:04,840 --> 03:46:08,920
You're not allowed to drink that Coca-Cola or that beer now, because I say it's bad for

3633
03:46:08,920 --> 03:46:09,920
you.

3634
03:46:09,920 --> 03:46:13,200
And it's a nanny state, and we're the collective.

3635
03:46:13,200 --> 03:46:18,080
And we're gonna get the gun manufacturers, NRA here, not the Second Amendment, but stakeholders

3636
03:46:18,080 --> 03:46:20,120
to decide if we're gonna ban the guns.

3637
03:46:20,120 --> 03:46:23,040
All this UN talk, let's go to that clip.

3638
03:46:23,040 --> 03:46:27,480
We are responsible for each other.

3639
03:46:27,480 --> 03:46:34,960
Again, we are responsible for each other, and it ties into all the rest of the garbage.

3640
03:46:34,960 --> 03:46:38,920
We're gonna be playing more of these clips tonight on the transmission.

3641
03:46:38,920 --> 03:46:41,280
Let's just go to more calls here.

3642
03:46:41,280 --> 03:46:44,280
Antoine in Florida, you're on the air, go ahead.

3643
03:46:44,280 --> 03:46:45,280
Hey, buddy.

3644
03:46:45,280 --> 03:46:54,360
I just wanna get a couple points for us, just I think we need to get on the offensive.

3645
03:46:54,360 --> 03:47:00,600
I think I was talking to a couple friends, I think we should march on DC with fake guns

3646
03:47:00,600 --> 03:47:04,720
cuz I don't want them to put a real person with a gun and say that we shoot people just

3647
03:47:04,720 --> 03:47:08,360
to symbolize the guns that we have.

3648
03:47:08,360 --> 03:47:12,120
And we should also, I also think you should do a special report cuz your special reports

3649
03:47:12,120 --> 03:47:13,120
are very effective.

3650
03:47:13,120 --> 03:47:15,880
I was able to wake up a lot of people through your special reports.

3651
03:47:15,880 --> 03:47:20,720
If you could somehow, I know you're very busy, and make a really good special report showing

3652
03:47:20,720 --> 03:47:23,720
everything that you talked about, how we got here, that'd be really great.

3653
03:47:23,720 --> 03:47:27,080
I mean, Facebook or social media, I've woken up a lot of people, just like you woke up

3654
03:47:27,080 --> 03:47:31,040
that lady, the Obama phone lady, right there on the air in front of us all.

3655
03:47:31,040 --> 03:47:32,400
I've done that to a lot.

3656
03:47:32,400 --> 03:47:36,920
I'm African American myself, and personally, every African American that I know that's

3657
03:47:36,920 --> 03:47:38,960
under 30 knows that he's a crook.

3658
03:47:38,960 --> 03:47:41,800
Now, the ones that are above 30 think he's God.

3659
03:47:41,800 --> 03:47:45,840
Well, that's what I've noticed cuz I do get obsessed reading YouTube comments.

3660
03:47:45,840 --> 03:47:50,280
And I go to the channels and look, and it's like most of the comments not just on my YouTube

3661
03:47:50,280 --> 03:47:54,160
channel, but others are like, this is a crook, we warned you, he's coming.

3662
03:47:54,160 --> 03:47:59,960
It's black people criticizing him, but then the media says 95% of blacks support Obama.

3663
03:47:59,960 --> 03:48:05,360
I don't think that's true, and I don't think these polls we hear that only 15% don't wanna

3664
03:48:05,360 --> 03:48:06,920
turn their guns in.

3665
03:48:06,920 --> 03:48:08,720
I mean, that's not what I'm seeing or hearing.

3666
03:48:08,720 --> 03:48:11,680
I don't believe these polls.

3667
03:48:11,680 --> 03:48:15,600
And trust me, I'm in the black community, I mean, my grandmother cried cuz I wouldn't

3668
03:48:15,600 --> 03:48:16,600
vote for Obama.

3669
03:48:16,600 --> 03:48:19,600
That's how bad it is to vote for Obama.

3670
03:48:19,600 --> 03:48:24,040
Okay, I was playing it to her all, and it was really weird.

3671
03:48:24,040 --> 03:48:28,760
They were contradicting themselves while I'm laying out the hardcore facts in their face.

3672
03:48:28,760 --> 03:48:32,520
You know, I've talked to folks who told their parents he's coming for the guns, and they

3673
03:48:32,520 --> 03:48:33,520
didn't agree.

3674
03:48:33,520 --> 03:48:34,520
But now he's coming for them.

3675
03:48:34,520 --> 03:48:36,480
You're right, but see, it's kind of too late.

3676
03:48:36,480 --> 03:48:39,800
But I mean, look, he said he wouldn't raise taxes on working class folks.

3677
03:48:39,800 --> 03:48:45,240
I mean, they're raising taxes on the poorest people in America that are the working poor.

3678
03:48:45,240 --> 03:48:48,180
That's pretty cold blooded, isn't it, when you claim you're this big communist that wants

3679
03:48:48,180 --> 03:48:49,180
to help everybody.

3680
03:48:49,180 --> 03:48:50,180
That's true.

3681
03:48:50,180 --> 03:48:55,600
And another thing I noticed too, as I'm an African American, and you get an action card,

3682
03:48:55,600 --> 03:48:57,240
he'll tell you the same thing.

3683
03:48:57,240 --> 03:49:01,280
The more educated black people have a hard time believing it, cuz they've been in college

3684
03:49:01,280 --> 03:49:02,280
and stuff.

3685
03:49:02,280 --> 03:49:06,000
But in the same way, look, look, look, these educated idiot yuppies, I don't care what

3686
03:49:06,000 --> 03:49:07,600
color they are, are dumb.

3687
03:49:07,600 --> 03:49:11,400
They won't listen to facts, cuz they're too busy laughing at you, cuz they're so smart.

3688
03:49:11,400 --> 03:49:15,080
I know, it's a joke, I appreciate your call, my friend.

3689
03:49:15,080 --> 03:49:17,920
Let's talk to Joseph in Texas, thanks for holding her on the air.

3690
03:49:17,920 --> 03:49:22,240
Hey, Alex, I've been listening to you for a while.

3691
03:49:22,240 --> 03:49:27,040
The question is, does everybody realize that history is repeating itself?

3692
03:49:27,040 --> 03:49:28,920
A lot of people do, that's why I'm freaking out.

3693
03:49:28,920 --> 03:49:33,960
We are repeating history, we're in trouble.

3694
03:49:33,960 --> 03:49:37,880
You need to actually, the one thing that you need to realize is that he's gonna present

3695
03:49:37,880 --> 03:49:39,880
four arguments.

3696
03:49:39,880 --> 03:49:44,080
The four arguments are gonna run along the political, which they're already doing.

3697
03:49:44,080 --> 03:49:47,400
The social with the children that he parades out.

3698
03:49:47,400 --> 03:49:51,240
You watch, next thing he's gonna come out with, and they're gonna cherry pick the data,

3699
03:49:51,240 --> 03:49:54,200
is gonna be medical and economic.

3700
03:49:54,200 --> 03:49:56,800
No, he's already doing that.

3701
03:49:56,800 --> 03:50:01,840
He's gonna turn Obamacare into a funding mechanism for gun grabbing, because Obamacare is written

3702
03:50:01,840 --> 03:50:04,360
to where he can do anything he wants.

3703
03:50:04,360 --> 03:50:11,120
Yep, but history's repeating itself, and it seems whenever there's a new bad thing, right

3704
03:50:11,120 --> 03:50:16,760
now guns with a new smoking, they're bad, according to the government.

3705
03:50:16,760 --> 03:50:21,560
They break out these four arguments, and the only way to fight them is basically say, quit

3706
03:50:21,560 --> 03:50:24,400
cherry picking the data, let me see the entire report.

3707
03:50:24,400 --> 03:50:27,040
Well, it's more than that, I got a right to defend myself.

3708
03:50:27,040 --> 03:50:31,400
I don't care what you say, you're not getting my gun, cuz I'm not guilty for what somebody

3709
03:50:31,400 --> 03:50:32,400
else did.

3710
03:50:32,400 --> 03:50:37,840
That, and do they honestly think, do the people in New York, these legislators in New York

3711
03:50:37,840 --> 03:50:42,560
who passed all these gun control laws, do they honestly think criminals are so stupid

3712
03:50:42,560 --> 03:50:46,880
that they're going to be stuck in getting guns from the street?

3713
03:50:46,880 --> 03:50:49,400
No, they're gonna go across state lines.

3714
03:50:49,400 --> 03:50:51,080
The criminals are gonna rejoice.

3715
03:50:51,080 --> 03:50:55,640
I mean, the criminals are on the run right now, because they're getting their butt shot

3716
03:50:55,640 --> 03:50:57,040
off by the police and the citizens.

3717
03:50:57,040 --> 03:51:03,200
We'll be right back, stay with us.

3718
03:51:03,200 --> 03:51:08,720
You land in Buenos Aires, then a shuttle to Santa Rosa, where a nicely furnished cabin

3719
03:51:08,720 --> 03:51:14,840
with all amenities, Wi-Fi, executive food and wine, and laundry service awaits.

3720
03:51:14,840 --> 03:51:18,240
After a good night's sleep, your adventure begins.

3721
03:51:18,240 --> 03:51:25,440
We're on a golden stag safari for big game, but it's not Africa, it's Argentina.

3744
03:53:00,760 --> 03:53:01,760
My name is Steven Heuer.

3745
03:53:01,760 --> 03:53:05,880
After 22 years of nutritional counseling, I've observed that most brain malfunctions

3746
03:53:05,880 --> 03:53:09,200
have at their roots some form of toxicity and brain damage.

3747
03:53:09,200 --> 03:53:13,040
So whether it is poor memory, poor focus, lack of creative thinking, or more serious

3748
03:53:13,040 --> 03:53:17,560
matters like inability to focus, speak normally, or remember things, the emphasis to getting

3749
03:53:17,560 --> 03:53:21,240
one's brain working optimally needs to be on detoxification.

3750
03:53:21,240 --> 03:53:25,640
One World Way supports your body's number one means of detoxification, which is glutathione

3751
03:53:25,640 --> 03:53:26,640
production.

3752
03:53:26,640 --> 03:53:30,640
My name is Angie, and my son has suffered from borderline autism and constipation.

3753
03:53:30,640 --> 03:53:35,400
I got him on One World Way, and in two months, his constipation is gone.

3754
03:53:35,400 --> 03:53:39,520
He has become friendlier, he can carry on a normal conversation with me, and he has

3755
03:53:39,520 --> 03:53:40,520
made his first friend.

3756
03:53:40,520 --> 03:53:44,680
He's doing great, and he looks forward to taking One World Way every day.

3757
03:53:44,680 --> 03:53:49,600
You could offer him a present or a cake, and he would prefer the One World Way.

3758
03:53:49,600 --> 03:54:10,800
Go to oneworldway.com, that's oneworldway.com, or call 888-988-3325, that's 888-988-3325.

3759
03:54:19,600 --> 03:54:27,000
We're gonna have a big info wars nightly news tonight, 7 o'clock central.

3760
03:54:27,000 --> 03:54:30,200
You can get 11 memberships for the price of one.

3761
03:54:30,200 --> 03:54:35,400
Just go create the username passcode and share it with people, that's how we get the word

3762
03:54:35,400 --> 03:54:36,400
out more.

3763
03:54:36,400 --> 03:54:40,840
Yeah, no more Mr. Nice Guy, the globalists are dropping the hammer because they're behind

3764
03:54:40,840 --> 03:54:44,820
schedule and they've got to kill our gun culture.

3765
03:54:44,820 --> 03:54:50,880
It's very positive that they're being this nasty, and it really shows we're hurting them.

3766
03:54:50,880 --> 03:54:54,400
And so they're gonna try to get their legislation through without ever really admitting, here's

3767
03:54:54,400 --> 03:54:57,480
a little kid, I don't want your guns, well, the bill says it.

3768
03:54:57,480 --> 03:55:02,240
Here's a little kid, hey, your Obamacare has death panels, no, it doesn't, yeah, it's right

3769
03:55:02,240 --> 03:55:03,240
here in subsections.

3770
03:55:03,240 --> 03:55:04,240
Shut up, racist.

3771
03:55:04,240 --> 03:55:09,920
I remember actually watching Chris Matthews call people racist, and they'd be like, I

3772
03:55:09,920 --> 03:55:12,480
see you are, you're racist.

3773
03:55:12,480 --> 03:55:14,840
How does not wanting death panels mean I'm racist?

3774
03:55:14,840 --> 03:55:19,720
Well, of course a racist wouldn't say they were racist, I mean, it's, look, little kids

3775
03:55:19,720 --> 03:55:20,720
turn on your guns.

3776
03:55:20,720 --> 03:55:29,440
The little kids want them turned in, don't worry, Jimmy, I'll get the guns.

3777
03:55:29,440 --> 03:55:37,440
I mean, it's so transparent, Obama takes our tax money and wages war against us and gives

3778
03:55:37,440 --> 03:55:38,440
it to foreign banks.

3779
03:55:38,440 --> 03:55:42,800
And then I try to sell t-shirts like the new come and take it one to fund my media operation.

3780
03:55:42,800 --> 03:55:46,320
And yeah, there's evil pro gun people that make money.

3781
03:55:46,320 --> 03:55:48,440
And him and Biden are like, that's really terrible.

3782
03:55:48,440 --> 03:55:51,640
Yeah, we didn't make it out of insider trading like you and Dianne Feinstein.

3783
03:55:51,640 --> 03:55:54,320
Yeah, Biden, gosh, she's incredible.

3784
03:55:54,320 --> 03:55:57,440
Jim in California, you're on the air, go ahead.

3785
03:55:57,440 --> 03:56:02,400
Hey, mega dittos, Alex, if you're not fan of me before the end of this, ask me about

3786
03:56:02,400 --> 03:56:05,440
the Paris Morgan thing, I have some constructive criticism.

3787
03:56:05,440 --> 03:56:09,440
But the reason I called, I think regarding the Second Amendment, we could clear up all

3788
03:56:09,440 --> 03:56:13,520
the confusion of terms, intent, and reason if everybody would just go get a copy of Unintended

3789
03:56:13,520 --> 03:56:15,680
Consequences and read it cover to cover.

3790
03:56:15,680 --> 03:56:17,000
Yeah, it's an excellent book.

3791
03:56:17,000 --> 03:56:18,000
It's an excellent book.

3792
03:56:18,000 --> 03:56:22,720
And I think later I'm gonna mail my copy to Barry Hussein, highlight it, might get me

3793
03:56:22,720 --> 03:56:24,360
killed but might be worth it.

3794
03:56:24,360 --> 03:56:30,400
But this whole discussion about 1776 and we're all gonna go have a gun battle in the street

3795
03:56:30,400 --> 03:56:36,680
and stuff, before we get to that point, it seems to me that it would be smart by trying

3796
03:56:36,680 --> 03:56:39,640
the intelligent approach first.

3797
03:56:39,640 --> 03:56:43,680
But if everybody that went out and bought guns and bought ammo and had background checks

3798
03:56:43,680 --> 03:56:49,040
and did all that stuff, would just stop paying their taxes, most of these problems would

3799
03:56:49,040 --> 03:56:50,040
go away.

3800
03:56:50,040 --> 03:56:51,240
Hey, brother, let's get something straight.

3801
03:56:51,240 --> 03:56:53,560
I'm trying to stop the Civil War.

3802
03:56:53,560 --> 03:56:56,840
Believe me, I'm gonna be the first person killed or locked up.

3803
03:56:56,840 --> 03:56:59,200
I don't want this, okay?

3804
03:56:59,200 --> 03:57:03,760
I'm saying they want to get it started while having kids around them going, we just wanna

3805
03:57:03,760 --> 03:57:05,040
be reasonable.

3806
03:57:05,040 --> 03:57:06,840
I'm telling you, we're in danger.

3807
03:57:06,840 --> 03:57:07,840
What's your constructive criticism?

3808
03:57:07,840 --> 03:57:08,840
Okay, I'll skip there at some point.

3809
03:57:08,840 --> 03:57:09,840
But constructive criticism, I'm Paris Morgan.

3810
03:57:09,840 --> 03:57:10,840
You were great.

3811
03:57:10,840 --> 03:57:11,840
I love you.

3812
03:57:11,840 --> 03:57:12,840
You're preaching to the choir.

3813
03:57:12,840 --> 03:57:13,840
But I'm not the guy when you go on Paris Morgan, you should be talking to, you should be talking

3814
03:57:13,840 --> 03:57:14,840
to my mom and dad and my neighbors and whoever.

3815
03:57:14,840 --> 03:57:18,440
I tried to share with other people and they couldn't get past the tone and the indignation,

3816
03:57:18,440 --> 03:57:19,440
which I totally get this.

3817
03:57:19,440 --> 03:57:31,000
Totally justified.

3818
03:57:31,000 --> 03:57:34,760
But I think you need to put on a little bit of a dog and pony show to get a few more people

3819
03:57:34,760 --> 03:57:35,760
over on your side.

3820
03:57:35,760 --> 03:57:40,320
You've already won the Over a Marty list and I'm already calling your show.

3821
03:57:40,320 --> 03:57:42,320
I'm not the target audience when you go on Paris Morgan.

3822
03:57:42,320 --> 03:57:47,280
It's the little old lady who sits and drinks the Kool-Aid all day that you need to be kind

3823
03:57:47,280 --> 03:57:48,280
of that-

3824
03:57:48,280 --> 03:57:51,880
Let me get to a certain point, but I found if you slap them upside the head, down the

3825
03:57:51,880 --> 03:57:53,160
road they wake up.

3826
03:57:53,160 --> 03:57:54,160
It's like a delayed action.

3827
03:57:54,160 --> 03:57:55,760
And I didn't even do that on purpose.

3828
03:57:55,760 --> 03:57:58,520
I just got mad at the sniveling lying.

3829
03:57:58,520 --> 03:58:01,400
Christ overturned the tables and beat the money changers.

3830
03:58:01,400 --> 03:58:04,260
Paul Revere rode around saying get your weapons and shoot people.

3831
03:58:04,260 --> 03:58:05,260
I'm not doing any of that.

3832
03:58:05,260 --> 03:58:06,540
I didn't overturn the table.

3833
03:58:06,540 --> 03:58:08,300
I'm not saying shoot people.

3834
03:58:08,300 --> 03:58:13,360
I'm saying look, look, you want my guns, you little tyrant, okay?

3835
03:58:13,360 --> 03:58:14,900
And I'm sick of you.

3836
03:58:14,900 --> 03:58:18,240
And I'm sick of your propaganda, all right?

3837
03:58:18,240 --> 03:58:23,640
Now, if you'd like to learn more, we'll be covering all this tonight, seven o'clock central.

3838
03:58:23,640 --> 03:58:28,080
We take you now to Klandathu, where our forces are winning an incredible battle against the

3839
03:58:28,080 --> 03:58:29,080
Obamanoids.

3840
03:58:29,080 --> 03:58:30,800
Alex Jones signing off.

3841
03:58:30,800 --> 03:58:34,520
That's a Starship Troopers plug there.

3842
03:58:34,520 --> 03:58:48,480
And I'm not going crazy before the New York Times talks about Klandathu.
