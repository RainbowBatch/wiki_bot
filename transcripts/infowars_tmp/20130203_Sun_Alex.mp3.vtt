WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
We've got it

00:07.440 --> 00:09.560
Waging war on corruption

00:11.400 --> 00:17.480
It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war

00:24.520 --> 00:27.680
It's the day of the big game

00:27.680 --> 00:33.800
And during the big game Super Bowl 2013

00:35.800 --> 00:37.800
From the season of 2012

00:38.400 --> 00:40.320
technically Super Bowl 2012

00:40.320 --> 00:45.680
We are going to be brainwashed by ads against the Second Amendment

00:47.240 --> 00:51.280
Financed by the globalists and other collaborators against our liberty and the

00:52.440 --> 00:53.720
exploited

00:53.720 --> 00:57.680
children of Sandy Hook survivors with their choir

00:58.520 --> 01:01.960
to tear-jerk and demonize the Second Amendment

01:03.720 --> 01:05.280
Unbelievably

01:05.280 --> 01:07.280
opportunistic and disgusting but

01:07.520 --> 01:14.440
Don't ever expect the criminals that run this system to not be opportunistic and over-the-top. They think you are stupid

01:14.520 --> 01:16.840
They think you are utterly

01:17.360 --> 01:21.560
And totally mindless they think there's nothing you won't buy

01:21.560 --> 01:25.760
We're gonna be going over the latest on the Second Amendment today

01:26.440 --> 01:32.600
but there is an article out of Forbes that's excellent that we have linked up at infowars.com and

01:33.000 --> 01:34.280
prisonplanet.com

01:34.280 --> 01:37.920
It's also I found it at drudgereport.com on the left-hand side

01:38.240 --> 01:42.680
NRA winning the influence battle over gun control

01:42.840 --> 01:49.120
And I don't just believe polls when I hear them or see them. I've studied polls. I've studied statistics

01:49.120 --> 01:56.080
I've studied how they work and I'm able to gauge polls over a long period of time from what I read in quasi

01:56.440 --> 01:58.440
internal government white papers

01:58.920 --> 02:00.920
plus what I see on the streets and

02:01.200 --> 02:06.600
This told me what I already knew they went to one of the biggest and most respected data mining companies

02:06.600 --> 02:13.080
And that's really the polling agency of the future and found that it is a total route of

02:13.520 --> 02:16.240
the anti-gunners the victim disarmament

02:16.240 --> 02:19.520
a kleptocratic crowd that wants to disarm their quarry

02:20.440 --> 02:22.800
In fact, they find with military precision

02:23.960 --> 02:25.240
organically

02:25.240 --> 02:27.240
individual gun owners

02:27.560 --> 02:29.560
supported through the

02:29.800 --> 02:34.000
NRA that we've taken control of it was under globalist control about 20 years ago

02:34.000 --> 02:38.000
There's there's no doubt and Larry Pratt agrees with me that that with laser

02:38.680 --> 02:42.160
Military laser like focus is the quote that we are

02:42.160 --> 02:46.320
Annihilating the enemy now that that that's a big plush

02:47.120 --> 02:52.720
And it's because we realize they're an enemy a deceptive group who don't want to take guns to keep kids safe

02:52.960 --> 02:58.740
Don't want to register guns to actually stop criminals. They want to target the American people

02:58.920 --> 03:03.240
We've seen them take the guns in any city the global is during control of we've seen them

03:03.440 --> 03:10.040
Disarmed people in more than 30-something nations the last 50 years or so. We know their game plan. We know their program

03:10.040 --> 03:12.040
we know how it works and

03:12.960 --> 03:15.760
Because we're one of the last countries to hold out like Switzerland

03:15.800 --> 03:20.640
We've we've gotten to have front-row seats to all the tricks and the globalist are global

03:20.640 --> 03:25.560
They run the same program the same plays they switch them up a little bit

03:25.560 --> 03:28.360
But it's basically the same playbook in country after country

03:28.360 --> 03:32.200
They try to take over and not just on guns when they go for the guns

03:32.560 --> 03:38.720
it means they're insecure and they're afraid and politically that they're not going to get away what they've done and

03:38.720 --> 03:44.280
And it means they want to use authoritarianism on the public now that said we're gonna be getting into that

03:44.480 --> 03:49.540
We're gonna be getting into an amazing report up at infowars.com

03:49.920 --> 03:53.940
That ties into like seven other links just to the article that Kurt Nemo did

03:54.240 --> 03:57.580
And I was even able to find some more we're gonna play some of these clips coming up

03:58.320 --> 04:00.320
Reverend Jesse Jackson

04:00.840 --> 04:02.840
To rip off Rush Limbaugh's

04:02.840 --> 04:09.040
He says it but well, that's how Reverend Jackson always says it the Reverend Jesse Jackson

04:10.080 --> 04:12.080
says gun supporters are

04:12.800 --> 04:14.800
Domestic terrorist. I shouldn't laugh

04:15.720 --> 04:22.440
There was a video saying on the on the comments at info wars calm right for Showtime like 10 minutes for air

04:22.440 --> 04:24.520
I laugh so hard. I could hardly go on air

04:25.280 --> 04:28.360
You ever laugh so hard it makes you start coughing and you can't quit

04:28.360 --> 04:33.400
It said Jesse Jackson responds to infowars.com and I thought well

04:33.400 --> 04:39.280
Let me put that we put that YouTube URL in and it was chunk from the goonies

04:40.480 --> 04:42.480
And then I realized that actually

04:43.000 --> 04:47.120
There is a resemblance to Jesse Jackson. I couldn't believe that. Oh

04:47.120 --> 04:59.120
Oh my gosh, he's the black chunk. Sorry. We're gonna be right back. Stay with us.

04:59.120 --> 05:02.160
You prepare by purchasing gold food and firearms

05:02.520 --> 05:04.800
But if you don't have a home security system

05:04.800 --> 05:10.520
Then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection when you're sleeping or away from home

05:10.520 --> 05:14.020
Who's watching out for intruders? Check out simply safe

05:14.020 --> 05:20.880
It's a new do-it-yourself home security system that is completely wireless go to get simply safe calm

05:21.400 --> 05:28.120
Simply safe is independent and off the grid. It runs on battery power. So even if the grid goes down you are protected

It's completely customizable so you can use it in your home business boat trailer storage unit or shed get simply safe calm

05:37.480 --> 05:41.880
Simply safe is also ridiculously easy to install yourself in under 20 minutes

So there's no need to let a stranger into your home

05:44.440 --> 05:48.540
If you move or need to relocate you can take the system with you wherever you go

05:48.680 --> 05:55.320
You aren't always at home, but simply safe will stand guard protecting your property 24 hours a day seven days a week

05:55.840 --> 05:58.240
Again, that's get simply safe calm

05:58.240 --> 06:08.000
Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network

06:24.840 --> 06:26.840
Nobody rides for free

06:26.840 --> 06:28.840
Nobody rides for free

06:30.800 --> 06:35.380
The globalists are not going to make our servicemen women mainly men

06:35.720 --> 06:43.080
Serve two three four five six seven eight nine tours in the last 12 years and not have massive

06:43.640 --> 06:45.080
suicides

06:45.080 --> 06:46.440
massive

06:46.440 --> 06:50.560
Mental problems massive health problems as well

06:50.560 --> 06:53.880
Did you know that they make US military personnel?

06:53.880 --> 06:59.800
You can look this up go into combat and force them back into combat when they've had legs blown off

06:59.800 --> 07:04.300
Oh, you didn't know that. Thank you for joining us. Ladies and gentlemen, it is

07:05.440 --> 07:09.920
Sunday Sunday the third day of February

07:11.720 --> 07:19.500
2013 I am Alex Jones your syndicated radio talk show host and I am very very thankful that you have joined us today

07:19.500 --> 07:27.620
Wow where to begin number one, there's new numbers out new numbers out 22

07:28.620 --> 07:32.980
Servicemen and women commit suicide every single day

07:33.900 --> 07:39.380
That is more than seven times the previous record from the end of the Vietnam War in

07:39.980 --> 07:43.780
1973 74 75 when they had bad suicides that is

07:44.620 --> 07:46.660
22 military veterans commit suicide

07:46.660 --> 07:53.140
Every day and I want you to know they're gonna talk about the veterans and talk about how great they are and talk about how

07:53.140 --> 08:00.020
They love them and and try to connect the veterans and their valor and their their heroism in many cases

08:00.860 --> 08:02.400
to the

08:02.400 --> 08:07.060
Establishment and the criminals that run our government from both political parties and the whole police state

08:07.060 --> 08:12.600
They're setting up and even though a lot of these wars have been fraudulent and wrong and have been done for globalist interest

08:12.600 --> 08:18.960
Still the men and women of the military that I've met that I know that I've talked to that I've researched

08:19.140 --> 08:22.860
they are the most focused awake people out there and

08:23.700 --> 08:30.220
They joined because they wanted to defend this republic and I am sick of all the fake

08:30.840 --> 08:36.780
Patriotism of oh, thank you for your service to the you know to the country and then okay. Well, can I have a job?

08:36.780 --> 08:43.980
Oh, I gotta go. I gotta go. There is a demonization program going on behind the scenes against veterans

08:43.980 --> 08:46.700
that's now busting out into the surface and

08:47.460 --> 08:54.500
There is a public cover that all the government and the media and the system loves veterans

08:55.140 --> 08:59.720
There's a lot of charities out there that have been caught raising money for veterans. It really doesn't go to the veterans

08:59.720 --> 09:05.300
And so I just wanted to mention up front today that we're gonna see lots of stuff tonight at the Super Bowl

09:05.300 --> 09:13.300
Connecting football and mom and apple pie, you know to the veterans and in and trying to make the political system look good

09:13.300 --> 09:19.480
They want you to have the memory of America and the Republic and the Bill of Rights and Constitution that our troops reportedly

09:20.060 --> 09:21.980
protect

09:21.980 --> 09:25.840
While they dismantle the entire thing in the background

09:27.180 --> 09:30.900
While they go to combat ground robots, not just drones in the air

09:30.900 --> 09:36.260
Humans, the globalists believe the ruling technocratic class are obsolete

09:36.740 --> 09:40.580
We are not obsolete. The tyrants are obsolete the old

09:41.260 --> 09:48.220
oligarchical systems of control that have pledged humanity in every civilization and every culture for more than 6,000 years are

09:48.620 --> 09:53.820
obsolete we either end this this system of dumbing down the public and

09:53.820 --> 10:01.100
Of playing grips off against each other and balkanization in divide and conquer or humanity isn't going to make it

10:02.300 --> 10:06.340
All right. We've got a big broadcast lined up for you again

10:06.340 --> 10:13.180
I'm live here on the all-holy day of Super Bowl Super Bowl Sunday, and I'm here because

10:14.020 --> 10:20.580
Football is not America football is not freedom football is a game that has been turned into nothing

10:20.580 --> 10:26.860
But a giant propaganda arm of the globalist and you're going to see ads paid for by the billionaire Bloomberg

10:26.860 --> 10:29.980
Who got his money from insider operations on the stock exchange?

10:30.300 --> 10:34.780
The gangsters got armed guards and helicopters and the rest of it who flies above us

10:35.140 --> 10:40.340
He is sponsoring. He's the main guy giving money to mayors against gun violence like the guns did it themselves

10:40.900 --> 10:47.060
And we're gonna play this ad coming up. He's running an ad there's other ads and they're and they're trying to get donations

10:47.060 --> 10:53.220
Out there to create an anti-gun anti-second amendment move across the country. They're gonna have

10:54.020 --> 11:00.220
The little children of Sandy Hook from the choir are being exploited by the globalist mafia

11:00.260 --> 11:02.260
They're gonna be singing during the halftime

11:02.660 --> 11:05.200
This is this is something I personally

11:06.060 --> 11:09.980
personally and boycotting our country's in deep trouble folks and

11:10.300 --> 11:15.100
I hear all these other talk show hosts about man the good thing about being America's Super Bowl

11:15.100 --> 11:21.620
I'm gonna savor this big game. I'm gonna I want my Bill of Rights and Constitution. I want my factories back

11:21.620 --> 11:27.540
I want my jobs back. I don't want the government shutting down our power plants while China builds three new ones a week

11:27.540 --> 11:32.900
I think going into depression is a bad thing. I'm not watching games. I'm defending my

11:33.740 --> 11:39.900
Constitutional Republic on this Sunday broadcast and I'm not I don't need to be thanked for coming in on a Sunday

11:40.140 --> 11:41.780
It's an honor to be here

11:41.780 --> 11:48.980
It's an honor to be on the radio six days a week broadcasting all over the world warning not just the United States

11:48.980 --> 11:54.140
But the planet about the global private crime syndicate known as the New World Order

11:54.340 --> 11:54.820
Okay

11:54.820 --> 11:59.320
Let me stop right there and tell you what's coming up on the Second Amendment front today

11:59.500 --> 12:05.860
Not just the Super Bowl being turned into a giant anti-gun extravaganza anti-liberty extravaganza

12:05.860 --> 12:12.460
So Reverend Jesse Jackson says gun supporters are domestic terrorists. The video is up there

12:12.460 --> 12:14.460
He told the Wall Street Journal this

12:15.220 --> 12:19.340
Four days ago and it made it into two newspapers

12:20.020 --> 12:23.140
about Jesse Jackson on gun violence and economic summit

12:24.620 --> 12:31.220
And the big bombshell is he says we're gonna have to have reconstruction we're gonna have to have the North take over the South

12:31.220 --> 12:35.320
Gun owners are racist. They're the new they're the new

12:36.500 --> 12:40.860
What do you call it a confederacy and gay and again, that's a talking point

12:40.860 --> 12:41.800
I got a bunch of clips

12:41.800 --> 12:46.860
We're gonna play right now and then coming into the next segment where on all these different shows you've seen it

12:46.860 --> 12:49.280
You've read it race has nothing to do with it

12:51.500 --> 12:56.020
And they're just injecting this to create division it is

12:57.340 --> 12:58.900
unprecedented and

12:58.900 --> 13:04.260
You've got Bob Schaeffer on CBS saying we defeated Hitler and the Nazis we can defeat gun owners

13:04.260 --> 13:06.260
We can take their guns on CBS

13:06.260 --> 13:11.140
He said the president defeated Hitler or the Nazis know our grandparents and great-grandparents did

13:11.860 --> 13:17.860
Just amazing. We've got other clips of Fox Sports saying look, you know, the NRA gun owners of the Ku Klux Klan

13:18.260 --> 13:20.300
We've got Jesse Jackson saying

13:21.340 --> 13:25.180
And then meanwhile, I see this every few days now. This is just from a few days ago

13:25.180 --> 13:31.740
MSNBC has host on mainly white house saying oh the racist crackers need to give their guns up

13:31.820 --> 13:34.460
Yeah, the Republicans are all just racist crackers

13:34.460 --> 13:40.920
I'd be like using the n-word talk about black people and it's meant to fire up racial division

13:41.420 --> 13:45.580
In this country and then politically correct groups can slam

13:46.260 --> 13:50.380
Anybody that says hey, I don't like you, you know trying to put me down and everybody else will just through guilt

13:50.900 --> 13:53.000
Basically submit to that so that's coming up

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
also, Chris Kyle

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
the

13:58.320 --> 14:03.360
Sniper the Navy SEAL sniper was gunned down yesterday up outside, Dallas

14:04.240 --> 14:10.920
With with the head of his foundation and a PTSD marine they reportedly taken out there. He's been arrested there

14:10.920 --> 14:12.840
They've charged him today

14:12.840 --> 14:16.120
And they're saying that this individual and I'll give you his name

14:16.520 --> 14:21.560
This individual who had PTSD and was under psychiatric care Eddie Ray Roth

14:21.560 --> 14:25.160
Is the main suspect in the killing as a three million dollar bond?

14:25.960 --> 14:29.600
Now again, you have 22 service people killing themselves a day

14:29.600 --> 14:33.120
And that's why I brought that up and then every couple of weeks

14:33.120 --> 14:37.320
You'll hear about a service person killing their wife or their boss or something

14:37.920 --> 14:39.560
statistically out of

14:39.560 --> 14:44.920
300 and it's now 20 million people. I mean statistically we've shown the statistics FBI gov

14:46.160 --> 14:48.160
Mass shootings are 88 a year

14:48.160 --> 14:51.040
88 people about half those gang related

14:52.040 --> 14:56.320
Veterans killing people is not even a thousand a year sounds like a big number

14:56.320 --> 15:01.400
But it's not even the top hundred causes of death in this country

15:01.400 --> 15:06.880
But the media creates this illusion and I remember seeing these Homeland Security reports four years ago

15:07.040 --> 15:12.400
When Obama got in suddenly saying veterans gun owners conservatives libertarians, they're the terrorists

15:12.400 --> 15:17.560
They're gonna attack veterans will use IEDs at every city to bomb police departments

15:17.560 --> 15:20.600
Remember that they were given the cops the training and I thought well that doesn't make sense

15:21.600 --> 15:26.760
Sure, you've got troops committing suicide. You've got them putting them on psychotropics that say on the insert

15:26.760 --> 15:30.240
They can make you commit suicide or go on a psychotic rampage

15:30.600 --> 15:33.600
that's there but still those numbers won't be high enough to

15:34.320 --> 15:41.000
The point is they're going to initiate and stage events. I've been saying that I'm not saying this is staged, but it fits the mo

15:41.960 --> 15:43.840
with the psych

15:43.840 --> 15:49.080
Psychotropically hopped up mind control subjects to start this stuff and look who it is. It's Chris Kyle

15:49.200 --> 15:57.240
We're gonna break that down as well all this and more coming up today. I'm Alex Jones info Wars dot-coms the new site

16:00.320 --> 16:06.120
Introducing pro one all of your filtration in one system portable on the go no more

16:06.120 --> 16:10.080
Do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride?

16:10.080 --> 16:16.680
You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosolic acid advanced

16:17.000 --> 16:21.200
manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new

16:21.720 --> 16:27.200
Aquametics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all in one filter element

16:27.200 --> 16:29.960
It is the only one that does it and out of the gates

Disinformation it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network

20:31.380 --> 20:36.940
All right, we are back live here. I'm gonna race through the key developments in the battle

20:37.100 --> 20:40.660
that's happening right now for the Second Amendment, and we're winning the

20:41.460 --> 20:47.540
War right now, but that doesn't mean we'll continue to win unless we continue to fight and Forbes is a big article

20:47.540 --> 20:49.940
Where they contracted a large data mining firm?

20:49.940 --> 20:57.980
It's actually tracking what you're saying not just what fake polls are putting out and they find that we are routing them on the Second

20:57.980 --> 21:00.620
Amendment, but we were routing them on Obamacare and

21:01.420 --> 21:08.180
The fact that it was written by the insurance companies as a forced corporate tax to rip people off and would double premiums the first

21:08.180 --> 21:10.180
Year, that's this year. It's now happening

21:11.020 --> 21:14.300
and have the average family yearly premium be

21:15.860 --> 21:17.500
$20,000 a year by

21:17.500 --> 21:20.740
2016 that's now official, but it doesn't matter they got it in place

21:20.740 --> 21:26.540
They're gonna ram it down your throat just because we're winning the fight for hearts and minds doesn't mean we're winning

21:26.540 --> 21:28.180
We have to go a step further night

21:28.180 --> 21:35.060
I'm going to get to that Forbes article coming up in our a winning the influence battle over gun control

21:35.060 --> 21:40.220
I'm gonna explain how most of these big polls are fake now. You can tell them a poll is accurate or not

21:40.780 --> 21:42.780
Okay, let's just stop right there

21:42.780 --> 21:47.780
Again up at info wars calm and our other sister site prison planet calm

21:48.220 --> 21:51.140
Reverend Jesse Jackson says gun supporters are

21:51.880 --> 21:55.460
domestic terrorists and the full interview and video

21:56.220 --> 21:59.660
Is up there, but first I wanted to play some other clips

22:00.220 --> 22:03.380
Here is Jason Whitlock of Fox Sports

22:04.940 --> 22:09.740
Elaborating on how he believes the NRA that means gun owners. It's never the Second Amendment

22:09.740 --> 22:12.420
Does it have to talk about that? It's the NRA

22:13.260 --> 22:18.940
It's never we the people that's the NRA speaks for us, and they're the new KKK

22:19.680 --> 22:24.240
Nothing racially involved the NRA shut up to train at the end of the Civil War

22:24.980 --> 22:27.040
Northern recruits and soldiers how to shoot

22:27.740 --> 22:33.140
Including blacks has nothing to do with the KKK never has the KKK in the south

22:33.500 --> 22:35.780
Got the first gun control laws passed in

22:35.780 --> 22:42.680
1868 because they didn't want blacks who were newly freed to get guns the truth is the anti-gunners have the KKK history, but

22:43.700 --> 22:45.620
It's just amazing

22:45.620 --> 22:48.020
It's just it's just so incredible. Let's go to that Club

22:48.020 --> 22:53.300
I did not go as far as I would like to go because my thoughts on the NRA

22:54.580 --> 23:02.940
And America's gun culture. I believe the NRA is the new KKK and that the the arming of so many black youth

23:02.940 --> 23:04.940
and

23:05.420 --> 23:12.380
Blowing up our communities with drugs, and then just having an open shooting gallery is the work of people that you know

23:12.380 --> 23:15.540
Obviously don't have our best interests. You know what's funny, and you know what's funny

23:17.140 --> 23:20.100
It drugs in this country when they started crimped

23:20.580 --> 23:26.020
Making me legal in the 30s the first places it was kind of left alone was the lower income areas

23:26.020 --> 23:28.860
So in a way what this guy's actually saying is true

23:28.860 --> 23:36.620
That the drugs were allowed in the minority communities and because it was a pretext to you know basically get control of those communities

23:36.620 --> 23:38.620
But that's corrupt mafias

23:39.480 --> 23:42.780
Knowing they could operate somewhere because others would say not in my backyard

23:42.940 --> 23:46.220
They always try to build the chemical plant in the poor neighborhood

23:46.220 --> 23:50.540
They always try to I mean it didn't matter if it's India and all it is is Indians living there

23:50.540 --> 23:52.540
They go put the chemical plant in the poor neighborhood

23:52.940 --> 23:57.380
Thought about race so much as it is about not in my backyard of the rich people

23:57.380 --> 24:01.400
But just injecting the NRA is the new

24:02.100 --> 24:03.060
KKK

24:03.060 --> 24:09.900
No, sir the people in New York and Chicago in the last 55 60 years that took all the guns out of your cities

24:09.900 --> 24:15.900
So that only criminals have them so you have the highest crime rates in the world in places like Chicago and New York

24:16.340 --> 24:17.500
Chicago's number one

24:17.500 --> 24:23.660
That's what allowed this culture and MTV promoting gangster rap and cop killer rap

24:23.660 --> 24:29.380
Where I just saw some other famous rappers just shot each other last week. I mean I mean, it's crazy

24:30.620 --> 24:37.900
That's that's that's black rappers putting that out and then the media and Sumner Redstone putting it out via Viacom and

24:38.540 --> 24:40.340
MTV

24:40.340 --> 24:45.860
That's not my fault. I don't want you to die. I'm sick and tired of hearing because I'm white

24:45.860 --> 24:50.220
I inherently don't like you now a lot of whites who weren't racist hear all this and go well

24:50.220 --> 24:54.340
you know what I don't like you either, but you know what I'm not gonna stoop to the level of Jesse Jackson and

24:55.660 --> 24:59.060
People like the individual Jason Whitlock

24:59.060 --> 25:03.100
I mean these people are a joke and they're they're the racist it's clear

25:03.100 --> 25:07.460
And it's how they sit there and are in our in our identity politic people

25:08.020 --> 25:13.980
And notice they always tell whites and conservatives don't be identity politic. You know why they say that because that's effective

25:14.580 --> 25:17.180
It's effective, but see I don't want to just be some gang

25:17.180 --> 25:21.900
I want people to identify with the Bill of Rights and Constitution and

25:22.300 --> 25:27.420
Declaration of Independence and freedom and all men are created equal endowed by their Creator an

25:28.700 --> 25:32.740
idea our founders had that didn't even get expressed to the last few decades I

25:34.340 --> 25:37.940
Have a dream that will judge people by the character of their deeds

25:38.660 --> 25:41.900
The content of what they stand for not off what color they are

25:41.900 --> 25:48.860
but let me tell you something the Democratic Party is now the party of institutional racism and aggression and

25:49.740 --> 25:56.740
It's disgusting. Let's go ahead and go to another clip. Here's Jesse Jackson bumbling around, but if you listen to it. He implies that

25:57.860 --> 26:00.140
States rights movement, it's inherently racist

26:00.940 --> 26:02.940
It's the new Confederacy

26:03.580 --> 26:06.900
Well, what do you call it when the federal government's run by foreign banks?

26:06.900 --> 26:12.740
Overturning the entire Bill of Rights Constitution the states are supposed to step in with a check and a balance. That's the

26:13.260 --> 26:16.540
Three branches of government and then those two are splitting the two again

26:17.460 --> 26:23.000
Just like the legislative split in two. It's meant so you don't get a dictator, but oh no. It's just racist

26:23.000 --> 26:29.340
You're Jesse Jackson these weapons. We're not talking about guns for your house and guns for hunting these military pause

26:30.340 --> 26:32.780
It's always the same script back it up, please

26:32.780 --> 26:35.820
I'm not about guns for your house guns for hunting

26:36.340 --> 26:43.020
Chicago New York and a bunch of other cities where these people run things with a globalist liberal socialist collectivist authoritarians

26:43.020 --> 26:47.300
they're not really liberals where they run things they take all the guns and then people like

26:48.020 --> 26:56.440
Jesse Jackson has bodyguards and a concealed carry and Diane Feinstein does and Bloomberg does and and and Michael Moore has guns and bodyguards

26:57.100 --> 27:01.060
Charlie Sheen who I know well for seven years you'll probably stay at this house 20 times

27:01.060 --> 27:04.100
You know he's like well. I got bodyguards, so nobody needs guns

27:04.100 --> 27:07.980
Hey, Charlie, and I told him this not everybody makes three million dollars a week like you, bro

27:09.020 --> 27:11.100
It's all about oh we feel sorry for the kids

27:11.100 --> 27:12.980
Let's turn the guns in just as a sign

27:12.980 --> 27:16.520
We're sad for him the globalist we should be mad at the globalist the PR

27:16.740 --> 27:19.440
propaganda is using the dead kids to go after our guns

27:20.580 --> 27:23.540
Again here is Jesse Jackson. Oh, we don't want your guns

27:23.540 --> 27:28.140
Which is not for hunting the Second Amendment in for that you know it's a script folks. He knows that

27:28.140 --> 27:34.980
He's following a script. They want the government to be able to totally take over while it arms of the teeth against us

27:35.780 --> 27:37.780
Let's go back to that clip here it is

27:38.620 --> 27:44.420
I'm not the hot guy's house who killed the people at Aurora. He was right near the airport

27:45.140 --> 27:47.660
Runway he could blow up airplanes with that stuff

27:48.340 --> 27:54.820
Well, we're waiting for that. That's like the next step these anti-american people. We're really arming

27:54.820 --> 28:01.740
To stop the government from taking our taken they're fighting the government. This is a confederate ideology. This is like serious

28:03.060 --> 28:05.900
So with power to do something about how they feel

28:07.060 --> 28:10.620
And it's places like Chicago. We need Homeland Security not just the local police

28:11.700 --> 28:14.520
Local police if this is Chicago

28:14.860 --> 28:20.260
And this is Chuck's gun shop right here have all guns are killed put the last five years come from this gun shop

28:20.620 --> 28:22.620
Thinking to them and look at it

28:22.620 --> 28:25.820
They know they know what if this is Iraq. You know the guns are made

28:27.020 --> 28:29.180
We're gonna go to break come back with the rest of it

28:29.180 --> 28:35.380
I got a bunch of other clips where MSNBC's Finney says you know it's the crackers everything's their fault white people

28:35.900 --> 28:41.720
Evil flows from white people I mean the ultimate bigotry unit just like the Nazis saying evil flows from the Jews

28:41.740 --> 28:48.100
But it's okay because it's the Democratic Party run by foreign banks who want to get a race war going in this country

28:48.100 --> 28:52.700
That's their goal. There ain't no doubt. We'll be right back these people are terrorists

28:56.940 --> 28:58.940

We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance

33:19.020 --> 33:21.660
You're listening to the Alex Jones show

33:21.660 --> 33:26.940
I will give the number out coming up here in the next segment. We'll have open phones in the second hour

33:26.940 --> 33:28.940
We are into the first hour

33:29.260 --> 33:34.140
Early three minutes into it right now. Okay. We just joined us. I played a clip of

33:34.700 --> 33:36.700
Fox Sports

33:36.700 --> 33:42.460
Caster Jason Whitlock is also syndicated columnist saying the NRA is the new KKK and I have

33:43.100 --> 33:47.580
similar clips here by well we had Al Sharpton and

33:47.580 --> 33:51.180
Say quote, but I forgot to get that clip queued up. We'll play that

33:51.740 --> 33:59.660
After these clips if you can find it say that we've got to overcome the south and whites and the Constitution

33:59.660 --> 34:04.620
He even said the Constitution you saw that a few weeks ago on the niche and it's every couple days

34:04.620 --> 34:10.620
I see prominently the talking point by white black Hispanic commentators you name it

34:11.260 --> 34:13.660
That that gun ownership is right there

34:13.660 --> 34:17.740
And they know how politically correct Americans are if they said put your child

34:18.380 --> 34:24.540
In ongoing traffic or throw your child into the oven or the microwave or you're racist

34:24.540 --> 34:30.460
I think most Americans would probably go stick their child in the microwave and turn it on and I'm not even being sarcastic

34:30.460 --> 34:34.300
I think we've gotten the politically correct point that if they came to your house and said

34:34.700 --> 34:38.940
Slit your rest or your racist the average white American would slit their rest

34:38.940 --> 34:42.860
They would they would absolutely do that

34:43.420 --> 34:48.700
All right, let's go ahead and go back to the Jesse Jackson clip. Here it is. I mean you break it you break up the trail

34:49.260 --> 34:51.260
We used to guns made in Barrington

34:52.140 --> 34:53.500
Rock Island

34:53.500 --> 35:00.060
So the chucks and put us up they make them to sit in they kill we stand around feeling helpless

35:01.420 --> 35:07.580
And so you've got some combination in this drug thing and so you've got some combination in this drug thing

35:07.580 --> 35:12.300
And this gun thing of of territorial fights the gun fights over that

35:12.780 --> 35:14.620
Maybe the four percent would kill assault weapons

35:14.620 --> 35:18.380
They kill these other these locks in these magazines where the killing is taking place there

35:18.700 --> 35:22.060
Some others is just shoot out because just because the culture is into

35:23.180 --> 35:28.620
Guns as a remedy my point is probably focused on fiscal clever and debt ceiling over here is this stuff

35:29.180 --> 35:33.660
Is not on the table and it matters it's metastasizing and it's festering

35:33.660 --> 35:36.960
So we're trying to put some focus on this issue of reconstruction

35:37.500 --> 35:41.420
Not just and we need target job for these zones of heavy unemployment

35:41.820 --> 35:46.300
With black males in chicago and new york member around 50 percent employer around 50 big number here in new york

35:46.860 --> 35:53.180
But so beyond just the job some plan for reconstruction and we know how to do it. We've done it and we do it around the world

35:54.700 --> 36:01.180
All right, let's go ahead and go to msnbc just a few days ago talking about the real problem in america here it is

36:01.180 --> 36:08.540
Those, you know crazy crackers on the right like if they start with their very hateful language that is going to kill them in the same

36:08.860 --> 36:12.780
06 the death now for republicans is the tone of this conversation

36:12.860 --> 36:18.240
They absolutely we had evangelical latinos wanting to meet with howard dean at the dnc

36:19.260 --> 36:21.340
I mean i'm just saying like that's a shift right?

36:22.860 --> 36:27.740
Now this is part of the hoax that the republican party's gone conservatism's dead

36:27.740 --> 36:31.740
Everybody really wants total socialism. Wow. This is a mandate

36:32.220 --> 36:36.220
I'm going to talk about that at the end of the segment when I want to go back to some of these clips

36:36.860 --> 36:38.860
here first

36:38.860 --> 36:40.860
Let's go to this next

36:41.100 --> 36:45.500
Clip, this is bob shafer on cbs saying presidents could defeat

36:46.380 --> 36:48.380
racism

36:48.380 --> 36:53.980
The presidents could defeat the nazis. They can defeat the nra i.e

36:53.980 --> 36:58.140
The nazis they can defeat the nra i.e gun owners

36:58.300 --> 37:02.220
They don't want to say gun owners or the second amendment or the bill of rights. They say the nra

37:03.020 --> 37:05.660
First they demonize the nra. They're nazis. They're scum

37:05.900 --> 37:11.580
They're kkk and then by extension you and then now homeland security met on monday with the

37:12.060 --> 37:14.700
Top mayors and sheriffs and police chiefs as you know

37:14.940 --> 37:18.300
And i've got those reports coming up and said no the new terror threat is not al-qaeda

37:18.540 --> 37:22.800
It's gun owners conservatives libertarians what they call domestic extremists

37:22.800 --> 37:24.800
They're returning veterans

37:25.040 --> 37:28.080
And they're just hyping that of tens of millions of veterans

37:28.080 --> 37:33.680
They'll use every week a veteran robs a bank a veteran shoots somebody. Well all veterans did that

37:34.160 --> 37:39.040
Oh, somebody does a mass shooting gets the guns illegally on a bunch of psychotropic drugs doesn't matter

37:39.680 --> 37:42.240
Doesn't matter. It's gun owners killed the children

37:43.600 --> 37:50.960
The veteran kills his wife veterans did that doesn't matter statistically and you can look this up at fbi.gov. We've done reports on it

37:50.960 --> 37:54.400
Uh, they've got it broken down in racial groups demographics everything

37:54.880 --> 38:02.480
You know that uh veterans are one of the most law-abiding groups out there. Does it matter what reality is you are bad?

38:03.120 --> 38:07.040
You are bad. Let's go ahead and go to this next clip with bob shafer

38:07.600 --> 38:14.500
What happened in newtown was probably the worst day in this country's history since 9 11

38:14.880 --> 38:19.520
We found osama bin laden. We tracked him down. We changed the way

38:19.520 --> 38:21.840
Uh that we dealt with that problem

38:22.560 --> 38:30.320
Surely finding osama bin laden surely passing civil rights legislation as linden johnson was able to do and before that

38:30.720 --> 38:37.680
Surely defeating the nazis, uh was a much more formidable task than taking on the gun lobby

38:38.080 --> 38:45.200
Uh, this is a turning point, uh in this country and uh, the president is going to have to do more than just make

38:45.280 --> 38:48.800
A speech about it. This is one of the best features i've ever heard him deliver

38:48.800 --> 38:53.280
But it's going to take more than that from the white house. He's going to have to get his hands dirty

38:53.280 --> 38:58.160
He's going to have to get in there and and work this problem until he gets it done

38:58.720 --> 39:00.160
but uh

39:00.160 --> 39:06.640
Unless we figure out a way to make sure that something like newtown never happens again

39:07.280 --> 39:14.400
Uh, we're not the country that we once were I think we still are I think there's hope I think something's going to happen

39:14.400 --> 39:18.880
Well, there you go the president, you know, he overcame the nazis so

39:19.440 --> 39:26.080
So he can overcome the gun owners. See we are now the nazis. We they take you are kkk you are nazis

39:27.040 --> 39:32.880
Uh, every time i'm see a clip of of msnbc they're saying whites are inherently bad

39:34.560 --> 39:39.360
In fact, i've been hearing it's it's over for conservatives white women support obama

39:39.360 --> 39:47.520
White women support obama black support obama hispanics asians and then the media does this victory dance. Oh, it's over

39:48.960 --> 39:51.940
It's all over for the unknown soldier

39:52.800 --> 39:55.440
And this big victory dance that oh man

39:56.000 --> 40:03.200
It's over and again foreign banks are raping you financially. They're robbing you they've raised the different taxes across the board

40:04.000 --> 40:07.040
They've raised the payroll taxes on people making thirty thousand dollars a year

40:07.040 --> 40:09.280
They've raised all these other investment taxes

40:10.400 --> 40:18.480
The obamacare plan sets it up where the companies cut their full-time employees back to 25 hours. They don't have to get the uh insurance

40:19.280 --> 40:26.080
And the gdp is already shrinking massively. That's the plan get you on welfare, but it matters as long as you feel like you're winning

40:27.200 --> 40:29.200
now the truth is

40:29.280 --> 40:33.120
The fix was in as I clearly broke down and it's done hard to break down

40:33.120 --> 40:39.920
Mitt romney's a globalist mitt romney was for gun control. He helped write the assault weapons ban that passed in his state

40:40.460 --> 40:41.840
semi-auto ban

40:41.840 --> 40:45.360
The truth is he supported carbon taxes. He supported open borders

40:46.000 --> 40:48.160
He supported abortion. Do you want to keep going?

40:49.920 --> 40:53.300
But they they put out the two guys who were almost identical in reality

40:54.400 --> 40:59.600
But they have a political fight with each other romney then becomes a conservative says some good things

40:59.600 --> 41:06.400
But it's all for show like a don king boxing match and then obama wins and there's evidence of massive election fraud

41:06.400 --> 41:09.760
I don't just say that there was evidence of fraud against al gore in 2000

41:09.760 --> 41:13.600
I hate al gore, but i'm on record saying there was evidence of fraud against him

41:13.840 --> 41:19.300
There is overwhelming evidence that mitt romney really won bev harris a black box voting. He's been a big democrat

41:20.000 --> 41:25.840
It would help make the hbo documentary hacking democracy said she saw a lot more fraud towards romney than towards obama

41:25.840 --> 41:30.020
The fix was in so the republican leadership gendel

41:30.800 --> 41:32.800
And and even rand who's a good guy

41:33.280 --> 41:37.700
Could be told to come out by their consultants and say we've got to get with the times

41:38.240 --> 41:43.760
And then we'll start winning I guess get with the times become left of mal say tongue on the false paradigm

41:45.280 --> 41:53.540
Because that's what's going on in this country. That's what's happening. That's the bill of goods that we've been sold as a society

41:53.540 --> 41:55.060
And it makes me physically

41:55.860 --> 42:01.380
Physically nauseous to see this unfolding the truth is congress for about six years. You can look this up

42:02.020 --> 42:08.340
Just type it in congress has a nine percent approval rating and some numbers in data mining companies have put out

42:08.340 --> 42:14.180
I'm going to go over some of that in the next hour show or maybe the next segment show that it might be as low as

42:14.180 --> 42:15.700
three percent

42:15.700 --> 42:18.340
So ninety something percent of people conservatively

42:18.820 --> 42:22.420
Ninety-one percent conservatively probably more don't like the government

42:22.420 --> 42:24.420
Don't like the government

42:24.500 --> 42:26.420
but if they can get it in a

42:26.420 --> 42:34.820
Coke pepsi ford chevy red skin cowboy seattle seahawks versus the eagles, you know, whatever if they can get a fight going

42:35.940 --> 42:40.580
Between two groups then they can get you to join a bandwagon and kind of join one side

42:40.820 --> 42:42.820
total con game oldest trick in the book

42:43.140 --> 42:45.140
false choice

42:45.540 --> 42:46.820
And that's what they've sold

42:46.820 --> 42:51.540
So there are a lot of weak-minded kind of bandwagon folks that have gotten away from obama the last four years

42:51.540 --> 42:53.540
When he didn't deliver all the free goods

42:54.260 --> 42:58.820
They kind of got back on the bandwagon because they want to be winners. Well by saying you like obama. You're a winner

43:00.260 --> 43:03.460

Um in the article up at infowars.com linkedin read in the featured news area

48:19.580 --> 48:22.620
reverend jesse jackson says gun supporters are

48:23.720 --> 48:26.780
domestic terrorist and and basically that the you know

48:26.780 --> 48:33.500
The new radicalism the new extremism is this new confederacy and that the gun thing's being used to try to again

48:33.580 --> 48:35.980
It's it's just more of what you've heard of well

48:36.780 --> 48:39.840
fox sports commentators saying the nra is the new kkk

48:39.840 --> 48:45.200
And and that's what said if you don't like obamacare, you're a racist if you don't like globalism

48:45.200 --> 48:49.360
You're a racist if you don't want to give it up your liberty. You're a racist. It's racial politics

48:50.560 --> 48:52.480
because this country now

48:52.480 --> 49:00.000
If in the under 20s is way more quote minority than it is white, but if there's uh again under this system now

49:00.480 --> 49:03.300
That's fine. They don't want whites having racial politics

49:03.840 --> 49:06.320
Okay, regardless of which side of that thing you're on

49:06.320 --> 49:11.440
There's a lot of different sides, but they certainly are going to create racial politics and notice

49:11.440 --> 49:17.440
It's a bunch of white limousine liberals who are leading it because they represent these foreign mega banks

49:17.680 --> 49:23.540
That have signed us on to debt slavery. That's the real civil rights violation that we're going under agenda 21

49:24.160 --> 49:29.460
Where globalist corporations are exempt from all these regulations and taxes designed to shut down their competition

49:30.400 --> 49:32.800
That china could have three new coal power plants a week

49:32.800 --> 49:38.800
We can't have any and hundreds have already been shut down the last four years and our power prices are going up and our economy's

49:38.800 --> 49:42.400
Shutting down. So the whole gun thing is also about scripting obama

49:43.040 --> 49:49.440
There should never be another child shot again. And if there is it's gun owners fault. He puts out that false idea

49:51.360 --> 49:56.240
And then diverts everyone from his drone killings arming al-qaeda and libya and syria

49:56.240 --> 50:02.340
Uh, the police state the secret arrest the ndaa the continuing torture the banker bailouts

50:03.040 --> 50:06.720
All of this tyranny. They don't want us getting in a populist movement

50:07.420 --> 50:13.060
Unified by the bill of rights and constitution and freedom together. They want to unify

50:13.600 --> 50:17.600
Disparate racial groups under a socialist ideology where their chief

50:18.160 --> 50:23.920
Is government versus the middle class which the establishment sees as predominantly white

50:23.920 --> 50:29.360
and so it is a racial ideology and a racial system for the

50:30.160 --> 50:36.560
Globalist in what they're doing. They are they are welding together a racial coalition and i've known

50:37.120 --> 50:41.840
so-called progressives that are really smart people and know what's going on, uh, and

50:43.600 --> 50:49.680
They they now will people I used to have on as guests they will sit there and say it is racist to not turn your guns

50:49.680 --> 50:54.240
in it is it is racist to not support obamacare

50:54.960 --> 50:59.280
even though it's a rip-off written by insurance companies it is and and it's like a cult they are just

51:00.060 --> 51:02.060
absorbing into the hive borg

51:02.480 --> 51:09.120
These are authoritarians and they get a wild reflected glory a lot of humans are designed

51:09.600 --> 51:17.280
To get wild reflected group think group power out of tribalism and the government is the big overarching tribe

51:17.280 --> 51:22.500
Welding in all these different groups and it doesn't matter if the government's screwing them

51:22.580 --> 51:27.540
It doesn't matter if the government's destroying their future doesn't matter if the government's injecting them with deadly vaccines

51:27.540 --> 51:30.660
full of cancer viruses and aspartame and thousands of foods

51:30.980 --> 51:37.380
It doesn't matter because they feel like winners and that's what matters to them

51:38.820 --> 51:40.340
They feel

51:40.340 --> 51:42.340
Like hey the government's my government

51:42.420 --> 51:45.300
In fact, we have an al sharp and clip coming up that we will play that one

51:45.300 --> 51:49.140
They're finding the one where he says we've got to get you know, defeat the Constitution

51:49.140 --> 51:53.140
He says we've got a we've got to defeat the Constitution. We've got to defeat the South

51:54.140 --> 51:55.460
Played that last week

51:55.460 --> 52:01.160
We have a clip of sharp and coming up after I play this mayor clip of this new mayor's against gun violence ad

52:01.540 --> 52:05.460
Where he says hey forget the Second Amendment. Yeah, it was there to protect you from the government

52:05.460 --> 52:13.100
But we got drones now the government's got drones and that's what they say when I'm on these different so-called liberal shows

52:13.100 --> 52:16.420
He's authoritarian shows in in in liberal clothing

52:17.100 --> 52:20.980
Thomas Jefferson was a liberal these aren't liberals. I know I say that every day is so true

52:20.980 --> 52:23.380
You got to get that through your head folks, and I'm sitting there

52:24.500 --> 52:27.980
Even before I went on CNN, they're like, oh we don't want to hear it's for guns

52:27.980 --> 52:31.460
the producer was saying to protect you from government the government has drones and

52:32.260 --> 52:36.140
I've been on countless shows you hear it everywhere where they say well the government has drones

52:36.960 --> 52:41.340
Yeah, and humans pilot those and they're under quote the Bill of Rights and Constitution

52:41.340 --> 52:45.500
They're not they're not under the declaration of war by Congress. They are illegal

52:45.580 --> 52:49.380
They're attacking countries illegally, but the point is we could get back control of them

52:50.100 --> 52:55.940
Our government couldn't take over Vietnam our government running our military couldn't couldn't hold Baghdad

52:56.540 --> 53:02.780
So I don't want to hear that because there's drones that you know forget it the hive Borg you will be assimilated

53:03.060 --> 53:10.020
Nothing can defeat the New World Order. It's our tax money our energy that built this giant military now

53:10.020 --> 53:14.460
They're getting rid of posse commentatis. They've they announced last week. They're gonna use the military

53:15.260 --> 53:18.020
for domestic operations to fight terrorists and

53:18.860 --> 53:25.700
Now any gun crime any crime where a gun is used is considered terrorism. That's the big announcement in the news

53:25.700 --> 53:27.700
I told you years ago. It was coming

53:27.820 --> 53:35.860
So you're now the terrorists the spying the data mining the checkpoints they've announced they're gonna use the NSA to target quote gun crime

53:35.860 --> 53:39.780
They've announced they're gonna use it to target domestic extremists remember

53:39.780 --> 53:45.420
They weren't spying on us five years ago, and then well we're doing it to fight al-qaeda and now forget about al-qaeda

53:45.420 --> 53:49.180
I've never seen an article. I'm gonna get to where they say al-qaeda is on an issue now

53:49.180 --> 53:54.020
Well yeah, cuz it works for the globalist publicly even general boykins come out and expose that now

53:55.220 --> 54:02.540
Former head of special forces no no no it's you you're the terrorist well no kidding the thing was always set up for us

54:02.540 --> 54:06.980
It was always set up for the federal government to absorb the states and now they're saying

54:07.260 --> 54:13.500
Obama is the new Lincoln anyone that opposes what he does is a confederate and now you're seeing it on CNN

54:13.620 --> 54:20.580
Fox Wall Street Journal all these different pundits saying the new confederacy is any state that resists

54:21.660 --> 54:24.420
Obama is here. He is coming. He knows best

54:24.420 --> 54:31.260
You know they're gonna shut down the plants shut down the factories raise the taxes till they bankrupt everything except insiders that are exempt

54:31.260 --> 54:37.540
And then you'll go on food stamps. You'll go on government assistance, and they're gonna have national compulsory service

54:37.540 --> 54:40.540
They're already announcing it and the Conservatives will say hey

54:40.540 --> 54:46.660
don't let those liberals not work since you know a hundred million two hundred million will be on welfare by the time they're done and

54:47.300 --> 54:49.300
Then you're in forced labor

54:50.460 --> 54:56.580
They did it under Roosevelt. They're already calling to bring it back, but ten times worse. They're not going to be building national park

54:56.580 --> 55:01.900
Lodges this time they're going to absolutely have gun control

55:02.420 --> 55:08.940
Checkpoints that's in the FEMA Corps documents from nine years ago in the Baltimore Sun in the Philadelphia Inquirer

55:09.100 --> 55:16.020
How they were training the small units of FEMA Corps college students to assist the police in

55:16.500 --> 55:23.540
Finding illegal guns and radioing them in and they have these weird red uniforms black trousers and red uniforms

55:23.540 --> 55:30.380
Completely fascist you've seen the videos Obama says we need a national you know a defense force a

55:31.140 --> 55:36.460
Domestic force just as big and just as strong as our military and then the videos of the training course

55:37.340 --> 55:44.660
Sitting there worshipping Obama like it's North Korea doing chants about Obama and doing military drills. I mean it's our typally

55:45.580 --> 55:47.180
authoritarian and

55:47.180 --> 55:51.520
Bloomberg who made two billion dollars off of insider deals the evidence is clear in the stock market

55:51.520 --> 55:56.640
who wants to tell you what you can drink and what you can eat and what you can do as illegal checkpoints and now body

55:56.640 --> 55:58.880
Scanners all over New York City a goon

55:59.400 --> 56:06.480
With his own private security force that that roughs people up in DC the talk radio network reporter who politely asked him a question

56:06.480 --> 56:09.440
Last week this goon wants your guns

56:09.960 --> 56:13.320
To ensure that his quarry his property is defanged

56:13.880 --> 56:18.320
To make sure you're gelded and now today during the Super Bowl coming up

56:18.320 --> 56:21.640
They're gonna air this ad like we're children. Please take the guns

56:21.720 --> 56:26.640
Please have a background check when they have background checks in 97% of the sales

56:26.840 --> 56:33.400
They want it for when you sell to your neighbor or give a gun to somebody where you can't ever transfer a gun again

56:33.400 --> 56:38.100
That's what her bill says and every time they register they then confiscate

56:38.520 --> 56:45.400
Criminals aren't gonna follow the law anyways, but the children, please take the guns for us. This is how sick it is

56:45.400 --> 56:48.400
Here's that clip from the upcoming ad today?

56:50.400 --> 56:52.400
Shows cute little children

56:52.960 --> 56:57.540
Once supported background and they play patriotic music in the background when they're globalist

56:57.700 --> 57:05.160
We think it's reasonable to provide mandatory instant criminal background checks for every sale at every gun show

57:05.600 --> 57:08.280
No loopholes anywhere for anyone

57:08.280 --> 57:14.360
Oh America can do this for us America can do it, please

57:16.240 --> 57:18.720
And and folks 20 years ago

57:19.320 --> 57:26.760
20 years ago lop here said that lop ears now said it doesn't work criminals still get guns and he went further

57:27.280 --> 57:30.720
He said the people don't trust the system anymore. That's right

57:30.760 --> 57:35.700
They don't want background checks because they're angels and really want to save kids the globalist could care less

57:35.700 --> 57:40.700
The government shipped guns into Mexico to blame the Second Amendment and killed tens of thousands of people

57:41.400 --> 57:47.860
Several thousand confirmed almost 60,000 dead the last six years in Mexico where they've taken all the guns already

Economic system runs from bad to worse the globalist model is to shut down societies and starve

59:23.720 --> 59:30.600

Coast-to-coast direct from Austin you're listening to the alex jones broadcasting network

01:00:00.100 --> 01:00:06.180
From his Central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues

01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:09.860
It's alex jones and the GCN radio network

01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:14.060
All right, I haven't even scratched the tip of the iceberg, but I'm not gonna make callers wait

01:00:14.060 --> 01:00:20.500
I'm gonna get to the strange death the very suspicious death of Chris Kyle

01:00:21.460 --> 01:00:26.620
Who Jesse Ventura has been suing and winning in court Kyle has had no witnesses

01:00:27.980 --> 01:00:32.540
Jesse had I think like six eyewitnesses that he came he went he spoke at the commencement he left

01:00:33.300 --> 01:00:36.660
Why would he come to a thing full of seals and say I'm glad seals are dying

01:00:36.660 --> 01:00:40.340
He never talks like that and then no witnesses to him being beat up

01:00:40.980 --> 01:00:42.300
Kyle

01:00:42.300 --> 01:00:46.580
Really was gonna probably expose some big wigs in the lawsuit

01:00:46.580 --> 01:00:51.300
And then he took a lot of vets out who would contact him say they had problems

01:00:51.300 --> 01:00:57.600
They probably sent a wind-up toy out on him, which has been declassified. They've got these people Sirhan Sirhan you name it

01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:02.100
I'm gonna give you my to and I don't just say that okay. It's got a lot of telltale signs

01:01:03.700 --> 01:01:11.000
But a real PTSD crazy would have those sides to we know he's under psychiatric care so the drugs alone do it

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:14.880
We're gonna look at that. Also the good news out of Forbes

01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:23.680
Where it breaks down from data mining not polling real data mining the gun grabbers are getting their head handed to them

01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:27.700
Politically though they could still go forward. They don't care

01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:32.480
But this is the big fight. This is the big issue as I said before Obama got reelected

01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:35.580
Well, I'll tell you doesn't Wayne LaPierre and others

01:01:35.580 --> 01:01:43.660
You get a lot of credibility, you know what remind me tomorrow with the nightly news John go get the clips where?

01:01:44.220 --> 01:01:46.220
Bob

01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:51.260
Chapman before he died talked about this too, but the head of the head of gun owners of

01:01:52.260 --> 01:01:54.260
America and the head of the NRA

01:01:55.060 --> 01:01:58.780
Who by the way the head of gun owners of America's back on tomorrow on the nightly news?

01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:02.740
They all said that we have our Intel

01:02:02.740 --> 01:02:07.740
There'll be a huge attack on the Second Amendment once Obama gets back in and Obama and the media said that's a conspiracy theory

01:02:07.740 --> 01:02:09.740
And then now look what's happened

01:02:10.180 --> 01:02:12.180
So pretty pretty darn

01:02:12.380 --> 01:02:14.340
pretty darn

01:02:14.340 --> 01:02:19.900
Amazing that Larry Pratt and so many others said that and it indeed happened, and then we're going to get into

01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:26.340
This whole skeet shooting thing and I haven't talked too much about the last few shows because I had

01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:28.580
So many other things on the front burner

01:02:28.580 --> 01:02:34.100
But Obama says I've been out skeet shooting I've never seen a shotgun like that

01:02:34.100 --> 01:02:35.620
He's shooting really weird

01:02:35.620 --> 01:02:42.140
Looks like a smoke gun or something like a pop gun and the White House put it out and said you're not authorized to use

01:02:42.140 --> 01:02:44.580
This photo it's only for press and media

01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:49.620
You can't put something out and vaguely say press and media can use it and then nobody else can

01:02:50.740 --> 01:02:52.340
Plus it was taken

01:02:52.340 --> 01:02:57.500
I actually checked into the law and the regulations and precedent on this with fair use if

01:02:57.500 --> 01:03:02.180
Taxpayer money pays for a film production on a percent taxpayer funded

01:03:02.740 --> 01:03:04.740
or if a tax

01:03:05.660 --> 01:03:07.660
funded operation

01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:09.580
Put something out there in public domain

01:03:09.580 --> 01:03:16.060
They can't selectively say who can't use it and the claim that no one has a right to use or alter the photo

01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:20.940
Knowing people would photoshop it and people thought it was almost a joke like they were baiting people

01:03:21.460 --> 01:03:25.420
To create a new meme of Obama shooting the gun. No the White House photos

01:03:25.420 --> 01:03:30.500
I've been on there now say copyright, and you can't use these well of course we use them

01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:35.700
I mean just because these criminals say we can't use our property now there

01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:42.740
It is Obama mocked for releasing skeet shooting photo during gun control debate and people have got him shooting at the Constitution and

01:03:43.740 --> 01:03:48.820
Like Looney Tunes where the flag comes out of the comes out of the shotgun look at that weird-looking shotgun

01:03:48.820 --> 01:03:50.820
I got to say that looks like fake smoke

01:03:50.820 --> 01:03:55.260
That looks I've never seen I've videoed a lot of guns firing

01:03:55.260 --> 01:03:58.340
I've never seen a shotgun with that weird white thing on the end

01:03:58.420 --> 01:04:04.140
It looks like a rubber stopper, and then there's that smoke looks fake, and then the porting

01:04:04.140 --> 01:04:06.140
I know they've got ports on the side, but

01:04:06.700 --> 01:04:08.700
And something's weird

01:04:08.980 --> 01:04:13.380
Something and it's almost like they put this fake stuff out to create the debate

01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:18.340
I mean like that it wasn't just that they put that out in layers with a computer program problem

01:04:18.340 --> 01:04:23.540
It had different type fonts within the same typeset, and it was a fake font

01:04:23.540 --> 01:04:25.700
That's meant to look like old-fashioned typewriter

01:04:25.700 --> 01:04:32.620
But the C's the D's all the letters had the same splats around them with a real typewriter each splat is different even with the

01:04:32.620 --> 01:04:37.540
Same letter because it's like a fingerprint or a snowflake. I mean it's just it's a hundred percent fake

01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:38.860
I mean you understand

01:04:38.860 --> 01:04:45.460
There's no debating fake fake fake fake fake fake fake and and I've got a good eye anybody's got a good eye

01:04:45.460 --> 01:04:49.940
That's work for Photoshop that photo looks fake that photo looks fake

01:04:49.940 --> 01:04:54.060
Okay, that I've shot more skeet than I'd care to even remember that looks fake

01:04:54.500 --> 01:04:57.140
What kind of gun is that we'll be right back with your calls?

01:04:59.420 --> 01:05:02.860
You prepare by purchasing gold food and firearms

01:05:02.860 --> 01:05:05.060
But if you don't have a home security system

01:05:05.060 --> 01:05:10.780
And you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection when you're sleeping or away from home

We are on the march the Empire is on the run

01:06:03.140 --> 01:06:06.820
Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

01:06:10.820 --> 01:06:14.060
All right, we're into the second hour here of the Sunday transmission

01:06:14.060 --> 01:06:17.940
I'm back weekdays 12 noon to 3 p.m. Eastern time

01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:25.940
We're going to be right back with a look at what's going on in the world. We're going to be right back with a look at what's going on in the world

01:06:25.940 --> 01:06:30.580
I'm back weekdays 12 noon to 3 p.m. Eastern that's 11 a.m.. To 2 p.m.. Central

01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:34.820
Thank you so much again for joining us on this Sunday broadcast

01:06:34.820 --> 01:06:38.140
I'm gonna go to your calls for the next two segments or so

01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:43.740
Then I'm gonna get back into Second Amendment news, and then I've also got some Postal Service news

01:06:43.740 --> 01:06:48.900
They say they're now immune from local traffic laws and when I saw this

01:06:49.820 --> 01:06:51.220
Yahoo

01:06:51.220 --> 01:06:53.980
Headline I thought a cop must have given them a ticket

01:06:53.980 --> 01:06:55.820
for

01:06:55.820 --> 01:07:01.380
Being stopped in a no stopping zone, but they're able to stop as they're putting mail out

01:07:02.380 --> 01:07:06.300
and then I read the article and it was about them running red lights and

01:07:06.980 --> 01:07:10.620
speeding through school zones with kids almost being run over and

01:07:11.140 --> 01:07:15.140
The judges ruled they're immune that is again the new royalty I

01:07:16.060 --> 01:07:20.100
Mean and again on average post men and women are really good people

01:07:20.100 --> 01:07:25.820
I I'm not a big fan of government institutions, but this is one of the first American institutions

01:07:25.820 --> 01:07:29.300
It's pioneering our postal system invented by Benjamin Franklin

01:07:30.020 --> 01:07:32.980
And I like the competition that there's a bunch of companies out there

01:07:33.380 --> 01:07:38.660
Like FedEx and and UPS and then a government one you know where they can all compete against each other

01:07:38.660 --> 01:07:40.600
I don't like the fact that it's subsidized now

01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:43.420
I think it kind of subsidizes the other guys in a way

01:07:43.420 --> 01:07:48.300
But the point is is that the fact that a judge has ruled there above the law

01:07:48.300 --> 01:07:51.220
Katie bar the door it's the same with the cops

01:07:51.700 --> 01:07:54.620
They don't get in trouble when they're speeding and it's not an emergency

01:07:54.620 --> 01:07:55.300
I mean

01:07:55.300 --> 01:08:00.380
This is the new governing class where they're above the law and the UN has diplomatic immunity all the rest of it

01:08:00.380 --> 01:08:05.780
I guess I already got to that didn't I there it is postal services. It's immune from local traffic laws

01:08:07.340 --> 01:08:09.340
Running red lights and

01:08:09.860 --> 01:08:11.460
speeding in

01:08:11.460 --> 01:08:13.460
school zones

01:08:13.460 --> 01:08:16.540
You know I was never a big speeder in neighborhoods, but now that I have children

01:08:16.540 --> 01:08:18.540
I mean, I just drive like five miles an hour

01:08:18.860 --> 01:08:24.300
When I'm going through neighborhoods, and I still almost have run over people on bikes little kids run out in front of you

01:08:25.660 --> 01:08:29.900
Just this week. I was cutting through a neighbor going about ten miles an hour and little kids

01:08:30.420 --> 01:08:34.260
Came shooting out in front of me on their scooters a little kick scooters

01:08:34.260 --> 01:08:40.020
And I was one like six miles an hour and thank God. I was right. I almost hit one of them

01:08:40.020 --> 01:08:42.020
I was going six miles an hour

01:08:42.020 --> 01:08:47.300
And it makes your heart stop it certainly does CJ. Yeah, there it is Postal Service

01:08:47.300 --> 01:08:52.460
We're immune from local traffic laws my favorite example is the UPS truck driver delivering mail while naked

01:08:53.260 --> 01:08:56.380
Or USPS excuse me for I did not mean to defame

01:08:57.420 --> 01:08:59.420
UPS is a USPS

01:08:59.420 --> 01:09:04.620
Okay, yeah, I guess the the USPS is immune, but not FedEx and

01:09:05.380 --> 01:09:08.340
Not UPS okay. I'm gonna go to your calls

01:09:08.340 --> 01:09:13.340
Then I'm gonna get to NRA winning the influence battle over gun control. I don't just believe an op-ed

01:09:13.340 --> 01:09:16.580
I don't just believe a poll unless I've done my own back research

01:09:17.100 --> 01:09:23.060
Because you have internal market studies you can get out that are pretty accurate see corporations want internal market research

01:09:24.260 --> 01:09:26.380
That's where you find the really accurate stuff

01:09:27.700 --> 01:09:33.500
Now I'm gonna be getting to some of that a big data mining company. We are routing them on the gun issue, but for one reason

01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:37.740
We are sustained and they admit in their algorithms

01:09:37.740 --> 01:09:42.500
we're gonna lose the Second Amendment if we don't keep pushing, so they're telling the the

01:09:44.500 --> 01:09:47.260
Anti-gun groups just just you know it's a war of stamina

01:09:49.220 --> 01:09:54.660
And so that's coming up as well and the Chris Kyle Navy SEAL that Ventura suing

01:09:55.220 --> 01:09:59.820
He got shot and killed yesterday very suspicious. We're gonna be looking at that some but right now

01:09:59.820 --> 01:10:06.340
Let's go to some of your calls Kim Michael Darryl Zane Jose John Frank Zach Glenn Dan

01:10:06.860 --> 01:10:09.740
Scott and others we're going to go to you

01:10:09.740 --> 01:10:16.200
Let's start at the bottom of the calls this time set at the top. Let's go to Scott in Colorado. You're on the air welcome Scott

01:10:17.180 --> 01:10:20.620
Are you doing Alex? I'm doing all right, but I tell you it's getting crazy

01:10:21.900 --> 01:10:24.060
Absolutely is Obama's taking over. I

01:10:25.060 --> 01:10:27.060
Gotta say that I've never

01:10:27.060 --> 01:10:31.700
Thought it would move this quick, but but yeah, he says the UN's over our military

01:10:31.780 --> 01:10:39.300
He can secretly arrest us if he wants. He's arresting good whistleblowers that expose any government criminal activities

01:10:39.300 --> 01:10:41.300
It's unprecedented. I

01:10:41.500 --> 01:10:43.620
Have a question for you Alex. Yes

01:10:44.500 --> 01:10:46.500
Who's Mallory Mahoney?

01:10:48.300 --> 01:10:51.460
Mallory Mahoney is one of our graphics people that works here at the office

01:10:51.460 --> 01:10:57.140
Wasn't she formerly with Stratford? Yeah, you guys are mentally ill and I appreciate your call

01:10:57.260 --> 01:11:04.780
you know whenever we hired six graphics people for the magazine and for working in here and the University of Texas is here in

01:11:04.780 --> 01:11:06.780
Austin Stratford is like a

01:11:08.220 --> 01:11:11.940
Private intelligence gathering firm that in my opinion puts out propaganda

01:11:12.300 --> 01:11:18.660
It's like a feedback loop to like agree with the Pentagon's they can say look this private group said it somebody worked there for a month

01:11:18.660 --> 01:11:22.340
And a half is a unpaid intern and helped write a paper on China

01:11:22.340 --> 01:11:26.180
And and I mean what am I gonna do if somebody was ever in the military or somebody ever?

01:11:26.580 --> 01:11:30.180
In come you how many people you know about a third of the UT?

01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:35.980
Journalism people that we bring in here for interviews because we heard a couple from UT actually three of them from UT

01:11:35.980 --> 01:11:39.980
Did you know about half of them or more at war had an internship there?

01:11:39.980 --> 01:11:44.260
There's not many places to get a media internship the Austin American Statesman

01:11:44.260 --> 01:11:48.740
The Austin Chronicle, this is for print the Houston

01:11:49.540 --> 01:11:56.040
Or the Texas Observer or whatever it's called that's small and then Stratford because it's mainly writing thousands of things a day that is

01:11:56.220 --> 01:11:59.580
Mental illness you see we're not worried about the New World Order

01:11:59.580 --> 01:12:02.700
We're not worried about everything else listen people say I work for the government

01:12:02.700 --> 01:12:10.280
Okay, I wouldn't get up here and say don't take the vaccines the government's pushing that I wouldn't get up here and say criminal elements

01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:15.220
Of our government were involved in 9-11 because they were or they're running al-qaeda and libya and syria

01:12:15.220 --> 01:12:16.700
I mean just use your brain

01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:21.400
You know what if I work for the government then I'm the worst government agent the planets ever seen

01:12:21.860 --> 01:12:28.040
Total mental illness and people always say you need to answer this or you need to answer that and no matter how many times I?

01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:33.600
Answer something I will still be asked the same mentally ill question over and over again people are looking

01:12:34.380 --> 01:12:38.340
See what's happened is the public has lost faith in the mainstream media and the government which?

01:12:38.340 --> 01:12:43.420
Overall is a healthy thing the founding father stated that history shows that but they had judgment

01:12:43.420 --> 01:12:46.420
It doesn't mean that then everything is fake

01:12:47.700 --> 01:12:55.160
It doesn't mean that I'm I'm Bill Hicks or that I'm I'm really an actor and the professor in

01:12:55.420 --> 01:13:02.440
Florida who says that Sandy Hook may have been staged with crisis actors, which they really have that I'm him. I mean mental illness

01:13:03.100 --> 01:13:04.860
mental illness

01:13:04.860 --> 01:13:07.360
But I understand in a society in crisis

01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:09.080
you

01:13:09.080 --> 01:13:11.880
Know just doesn't believe anything anymore mental illness

Let's go ahead and talk to

01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:18.920

01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:23.480
Thank you, sir

01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:28.200
I'm a caller and I got a serious story here a fellow member of we are change

01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:31.400
New Jersey has just been arrested here in Jersey City

01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:39.120
and they're also trying to link this for gun possession and they're trying to link this to the info wars Obama dictator poster contest that

01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:46.400
We participated in saying that it's extreme to print out print posters of Obama with dictator scum posted at the bottom of this

01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:48.880
So they're saying in the Jersey Journal. It says right here

01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:56.480
MJ comm Jersey City police say man had illegal rifle handguns as well as prohibited bullets

01:13:56.480 --> 01:13:58.760
And so they're getting him for the muzzle

01:13:58.760 --> 01:14:04.440
Modification the flash suppressor making it an illegal weapon in New Jersey. Yeah for those who don't know there now

01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:08.520
They're no magazine. Sure. Sure. I'm glad you called in about this and listen

01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:12.600
I've told everybody I didn't just say that last hour to have fun

01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:18.480
They've officially announced gun owners are the number one new terror group along with returning veterans

01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:24.520
libertarians and conservatives the government is so authoritarian so of so

01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:31.160
Absolutely Marxist at the grassroots of the government. It's foreign banks at the top, but they'll use whoever they've got

01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:33.400
They are so out of control

01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:38.440
They're openly saying and I've already seen this not the article you're talking about that anyone

01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:46.160
Criticizing Obama's a terrorist anybody who owns the guns are racist and that we're the new terrorists not al-qaeda and Homeland Security's main job

01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:48.040
I'm gonna say that again

01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:52.200
Homeland Security's main job is going after the American people now

01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:55.720

Coast-to-coast direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network

01:20:13.080 --> 01:20:15.720
Crashing through the lies and disinformation

01:20:16.200 --> 01:20:20.840
It's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network

01:20:21.840 --> 01:20:25.780
We have to politically get good members of the House and Senate federally

01:20:25.780 --> 01:20:32.400
But also state legislatures to come out authoritatively and say look these purges are wrong in Connecticut, New Jersey

01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:35.400
California New York and other states

01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:41.920
What's happening is and I see these articles all the time now. We're gonna go over a few of them here in just a moment

01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:44.380
where

01:20:44.380 --> 01:20:50.880
Not even the the ban of over 10 capacity magazines where you can't physically possess them

01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:55.480
Hadn't even fully gone into effect yet and a army veteran no criminal record

01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:01.800
Who actually ran a charity for other veterans? They they have a license plate reading software now

01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:06.440
most police cars in in in major cities have them and

01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:12.720
They admit because it's on the Southern Poverty Law Center watch list and ADL watch list that whoever they say

01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:17.480
Is a group you now are a terrorist you now have no rights returning veterans

01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:24.040
gun owners we are change is a group that spun off from one of my listeners Luke Rudowski that just goes out and asks

01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:26.480
journalists you know citizen questions

01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:29.800
I'm in there

01:21:29.800 --> 01:21:36.680
People that don't like the Federal Reserve are in there and and these foreign globalist organizations like the Southern Poverty Law Center and ADL

01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:41.800
They're there saying if you believe in a new world order you're a terrorist and they brainwash the cops

01:21:41.960 --> 01:21:44.860
They tell them the founding fathers are bad. I'm not joking

01:21:44.860 --> 01:21:48.720
I have the training videos in my film road to tyranny they tell them all this

01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:52.960
They have four shows now airing on TV. We're set to air this year

01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:56.480
Demonizing the founders

01:21:56.560 --> 01:21:59.640
Whole sitcoms dramas like I hate Paul Revere

01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:05.020
This is the new cool thing as Al Sharpton said we quote must is the quote

01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:07.720
Overcome the founding fathers

01:22:08.200 --> 01:22:10.400
Overcome the Constitution was his exact quote

01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:18.320
And you're like, but it doesn't make sense we're racist cuz we own guns well a lot of people that aren't white-owned guns

01:22:18.320 --> 01:22:22.760
What it's about individualism. It doesn't matter. They're just gonna demonize you so in the news

01:22:22.760 --> 01:22:24.920
They say an extremist was arrested now

01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:30.200
He brought this up and I actually have the article we can punch it up on screen or go to the document cam shot here

01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:32.200
for people

01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:35.600
Jersey City police say man had illegal rifle

01:22:35.600 --> 01:22:41.200
prohibited bullets at home, and they're saying he had over a 10-round mag and

01:22:41.760 --> 01:22:43.880
they're saying that he had a

01:22:45.160 --> 01:22:50.960
Flash depressor on it, which does nothing so this is it. They're gonna come after the gun owners

01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:54.760
And they're now even in the places that don't have a lot of gun laws

01:22:55.000 --> 01:23:00.640
SWAT teaming people because the neighbors said they saw a gun and going you'll never get your hundred guns back because you shouldn't add a

01:23:00.640 --> 01:23:04.160
Hundred or just like New Orleans where they went to the high and dry areas and took the guns

01:23:04.160 --> 01:23:06.160
So so here it is out of Forbes

01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:12.520
NRA winning the influence battle over gun control yes, we're winning in the scientific polls

01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:17.240
We're winning in the inner research. We're winning on the internet scans, but they don't care

01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:20.800
They're just gonna say we're terrorists and turn homeland security loose on us

01:23:21.320 --> 01:23:23.380
the government shipped

01:23:23.380 --> 01:23:29.360
20,000 guns and hand grenades into Mexico the memos came out to blame the Second Amendment. They're ruthless

01:23:29.360 --> 01:23:35.720
they want our guns while they buy 1.6 billion bullets and armored vehicles and build emergency centers and

01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:41.740
federalize the police and set up warrantless checkpoints now like they have in Austin with the the TSA

01:23:42.200 --> 01:23:48.840
Totally illegal totally unconstitutional. They're just doing it huge military drills every day in major cities

01:23:50.080 --> 01:23:56.600
Terrorizing the public getting us ready for military occupation Army Times admits. They're preparing to have troops on the streets

01:23:56.600 --> 01:24:02.120
It's already happening everything. I warned you about 15 16 17 years ago is happening

01:24:02.940 --> 01:24:09.120
Because they announced it today government to take control of private pension funds to protect them

01:24:09.480 --> 01:24:11.680
That's the headline at info wars comm

01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:17.800
big government announcement Friday and there will be a special tax on top of the

01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:24.580
3.8% tax already there on top of pension funds in Obamacare and the 3.8% increase in

01:24:24.580 --> 01:24:28.620
Payroll tax and all the new taxes because they love you

01:24:29.020 --> 01:24:34.540
No, it's the governing class is going to take everything. We've got it's happened hundreds of times in other nations

01:24:34.540 --> 01:24:38.140
It's getting ready to happen here now. I got to get to all the callers, but Glenn in, New Jersey

01:24:38.820 --> 01:24:42.060
I'll put you on hold after you go. You can give me all the names and facts

01:24:42.060 --> 01:24:48.340
I did find where the other blog where they're talking about yeah, this guy who had the 30-round mag

01:24:48.780 --> 01:24:54.300
He he had he was part of a poster contest where they put up posters saying Obama was bad

01:24:54.300 --> 01:25:00.340
It should be illegal these are extremists. Oh my gosh. You don't say somebody the government's bad in America

01:25:00.340 --> 01:25:04.340
You don't have freedom of speech, so yes. Thank you for giving us a heads up about that

01:25:05.260 --> 01:25:09.880
As you were saying during the break when I talked to you. They are going to try a purge of gun owners

01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:11.260
They're testing it right now

01:25:11.260 --> 01:25:16.380
We've got to get back in their face and go you're the terrorist coming in and taking over our country

01:25:16.380 --> 01:25:21.460
Saying our military is under foreign control. That's official and saying our guns are illegal go ahead

01:25:21.460 --> 01:25:23.420
absolutely

01:25:23.420 --> 01:25:27.820
Thank you Alex Jones for having me. Don't thank me. I won't have time to get all the other callers

01:25:27.820 --> 01:25:32.740
Yeah, no more. I'm gonna put you on hold. I'm gonna put you on hold Rush Limbaugh did this 20 years ago

01:25:32.740 --> 01:25:36.260
I got to do it. You just got to say dittos folks all we do is say how great I am

01:25:36.260 --> 01:25:40.060
I am not great. Okay. I'm angry. I want to keep my liberties

01:25:40.060 --> 01:25:44.740
I don't like a bunch of crooks taking over and running my life. Okay. I'm sorry go ahead caller

01:25:45.300 --> 01:25:49.100
Yeah, they basically look. He's in jail right now. He is a friend of mine

01:25:49.100 --> 01:25:53.740
We did the poster contest his other blog the Pope post is one of us question mark

01:25:53.740 --> 01:25:56.740
And it says part of his legal troubles might be linked to this video

01:25:56.860 --> 01:26:02.700
That he and a friend made in Jersey City and a link to the Facebook post of the Obama poster contest that we entered in

01:26:02.700 --> 01:26:03.980
So yeah, they're kind of smear us

01:26:03.980 --> 01:26:05.380
They're trying to do a purge right now

01:26:05.380 --> 01:26:10.500
Anyone who listens to Alex Jones info wars anyone who supports liberty and I don't even own any firearms

01:26:10.500 --> 01:26:14.220
And that's the whole problem here is that I'm just putting up posters out there

01:26:14.220 --> 01:26:21.460
On behalf of your poster contest or any other posters. I've done posters on my own exactly look we have an authoritarian government

01:26:22.180 --> 01:26:27.660
Obviously authoritarians don't like their slaves being armed the last thing they've taken is our guns

01:26:27.740 --> 01:26:34.220
That's the last they've already taken the bank accounts the dollar. They're gonna take everything they need those guns first though

01:26:34.700 --> 01:26:38.100
They're gonna go ahead with it and have a civil war they want to get as many

01:26:38.100 --> 01:26:44.460
Voluntarily as they can we've got a Stalin or a Hitler in control, but it's bigger than Obama

01:26:44.460 --> 01:26:49.780
The Republican leadership's been told you better go along with it. That's why they're saying. Oh, we got a broken wing

01:26:49.940 --> 01:26:56.160
We've got to do whatever big government says it's a mandate socialism turn your guns in because they're controlled

01:26:56.160 --> 01:27:00.260
I'm gonna put you on hold I want to get all the info if you write a blurb about it

01:27:00.260 --> 01:27:03.080
We can link to it. You're gonna be okay. Don't let them scare you

01:27:03.080 --> 01:27:08.840
This is going on where the crime bosses run everything, New York, Chicago areas of Jersey

01:27:08.920 --> 01:27:13.080
This is what it's turned into let's jam in another call here. I gotta get to more of these

01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:16.780
Let's talk to Zach in Tennessee. You're on the air Zach

01:27:20.240 --> 01:27:23.560
Yeah, if you need to I don't know if you call the thing today

01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:27.600
It says three well-known Second Amendment supporters young business owners

01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:32.480
And I know you've covered them all on your show Chris Kyle Keith Ratliff the FPS rusher guy

01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:39.280
And then also the John the Vinsky and they said they all died under mysterious circumstances within one month

01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:41.440
But that's not even that important

01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:45.320
Listen it's really starting to emerge that they've got killings

01:27:45.320 --> 01:27:52.800
I mean SPS Russian producer was tied up and killed execution style there are more and more pro-gun people getting killed

01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:58.720
There's this video out right now called Yolo it was all over YouTube last weekend

01:27:58.720 --> 01:28:04.000
Basically, it's demonizing preppers and saying that anyone who you know doesn't live life on the edge

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:08.000
It's basically a call to a young generation to do whatever they want and live recklessly

01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:12.240
And then I know you covered the Milwaukee Sheriff on Piers Morgan

01:28:12.240 --> 01:28:14.920
I was going to comment on that but more importantly than that

01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:18.760
Bill Maher was demonizing conspiracy theorists about a week or two ago

01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:22.340
And you know they were basically he had all these left and rightists on there

01:28:22.340 --> 01:28:27.600
And they were saying you know 9-11 shooters are from the left and whoever thinks the birthday thing is fake

01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:30.160
Then you know they're from the right, so they're just playing no

01:28:30.440 --> 01:28:34.880
They're saying you're a bad guy if you don't believe the known liars

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:41.440
But being a conspiracy theorist means I don't believe a government and a mainstream media system caught lying

01:28:41.640 --> 01:28:48.640
Thousands of times to me that's what it is today if you question if you don't just on the surface believe whatever they say look

01:28:49.020 --> 01:28:54.700
How do you know if media is good you judge the tree by its fruits look at the fruits of the political system?

01:28:54.700 --> 01:28:57.260

You're listening to the Alex Jones Show

01:33:36.940 --> 01:33:43.940
Alright we're back here and you can hear the frantic voices of the people calling in

01:33:43.940 --> 01:33:47.940
The power structure doesn't want to go after criminals they are criminals

01:33:47.940 --> 01:33:53.940
The power structure and it's really bad on the East Coast and other crime syndicate controlled areas obviously

01:33:53.940 --> 01:34:00.940
They want to target the little guys and teach us that they're basically our owners

01:34:00.940 --> 01:34:03.940
That's what all of this is about

01:34:03.940 --> 01:34:14.940
Now up on screen if you are a TV viewer I have an article out of the Smithsonian magazine

01:34:14.940 --> 01:34:21.940
For forty years the Russian family was cut off from all human contact unaware of World War II

01:34:21.940 --> 01:34:29.940
In the 1930s they came to their Christian village the Soviet atheist and they mowed down their families mercilessly

01:34:29.940 --> 01:34:32.940
This has been declassified by the archives

01:34:32.940 --> 01:34:42.940
And in 1978 geologists were flying around looking for outcroppings a hundred and fifty miles from even the smallest town

01:34:42.940 --> 01:34:51.940
And the helicopter picked up what tended to look like tilled fields I want to do a whole report on this

01:34:51.940 --> 01:34:58.940
And this family of five lived there the mother had starved to death when her children were small one winter

01:34:58.940 --> 01:35:03.940
Refusing to eat so they'd have the only food and they were dressed like cavemen everything

01:35:03.940 --> 01:35:10.940
They had walked more than five hundred miles total from their original village because the Soviets were always hunting

01:35:10.940 --> 01:35:14.940
They wanted to kill every Christian they could get to didn't matter how much money needed to be spent

01:35:14.940 --> 01:35:19.940
And you can go read the full annals of this it was so important to kill Christians

01:35:19.940 --> 01:35:26.940
And these were just poor villagers and it describes how they ran into the woods with just a bag of seeds

01:35:26.940 --> 01:35:32.940
And then a blight killed their rye crops the mother starved to death but a year later

01:35:32.940 --> 01:35:39.940
They live in different camps over the decades that it took them to get a hundred and fifty miles out in the middle of nowhere

01:35:39.940 --> 01:35:48.940
And the Soviets killed conservatively off and on around 50 million people from 1917 through the 1980s

01:35:48.940 --> 01:35:56.940
And before the Soviets could basically get to most of them they caught pneumonia probably because their immune systems were so debilitated

01:35:56.940 --> 01:36:03.940
Once other humans came around with new strains of viruses most of them died one of them is living today one of the daughters

01:36:03.940 --> 01:36:14.940
But you read about you know the things they've said and what they went through and there were tens of thousands they ended up finding decades later in the woods

01:36:14.940 --> 01:36:19.940
And exterminated because even though you're living out in the middle of nowhere 50 miles 100 miles it doesn't matter

01:36:19.940 --> 01:36:26.940
You need to die because the all-powerful atheist state says so and of course the atheists come and they're gonna have guns

01:36:26.940 --> 01:36:32.940
Piers Morgan said he'd like to shoot me and a lot of Buzz Bissinger said he'd like to shoot me

01:36:32.940 --> 01:36:38.940
And a lot of others they talk about how they want to kill us these are horrible people very very horrible people

01:36:38.940 --> 01:36:47.940
But America is that's why they demonize preppers that's why if you don't trust the system and you want to be self-sufficient they don't like you

01:36:47.940 --> 01:36:52.940
They want you under their control like Bob Dylan wrote in 1983

01:36:52.940 --> 01:36:57.940
Yeah I can see someday when even having your own garden they'll be against the law

01:36:57.940 --> 01:37:06.940
Yeah it's sundown on the union what was made in the USA sure sounded like a good idea until things got in the way

01:37:06.940 --> 01:37:13.940
Yeah we used to grow corn in Kansas now we grow it on the moon and eat it raw

01:37:13.940 --> 01:37:20.940
Talk about somebody that saw the future and that's what's going on here that's what's happening

01:37:20.940 --> 01:37:28.940
That's why they want you shut down when you punch it back up on screen for folks I want to show the viewers out there people watching at Infowarsnews.com

01:37:28.940 --> 01:37:37.940
The 40 years the Russian family was cut off from all human contact unaware and just amazing helicopter photos of their little shack they built

01:37:37.940 --> 01:37:46.940
No hammers no nails little daughters that were tiny girls when they ran and I was looking at some of the other photos on the deeper in the Smithsonian site

01:37:46.940 --> 01:37:56.940
Showing the aerial shots there it is of the terraces they put up on the side of the gorge to grow the few plants that they had they could also keep the seeds from

01:37:56.940 --> 01:38:01.940
In the future you run to the hills with your seeds they'll only grow once then they don't grow the next year

01:38:01.940 --> 01:38:06.940
It's all about patenting life all about centralized control that's the name of the game

01:38:06.940 --> 01:38:13.940
And that's why they don't want you self-sufficient that's why all over the country now they're saying you can't have a backyard garden you might grow marijuana

01:38:13.940 --> 01:38:22.940
You might see you're guilty until proven innocent you can't trust a prisoner we're all prisoners now that try to grow a garden in your backyard

01:38:22.940 --> 01:38:30.940
Don't trust that in America government's got to come look government it's all secret building bunkers and buying billions around ammo but you

01:38:30.940 --> 01:38:35.940
Well they're now saying to see something say something main program is do you see guns in people's houses

01:38:35.940 --> 01:38:44.940
And the average anti-gunner is such a dumb mindless domesticated creature that they come in your house they see a gun case they call the police

01:38:44.940 --> 01:38:51.940
And the police come and take it even though it's not illegal and they go well there was just a report you may sue us try to get your guns back you see that in the news

01:38:51.940 --> 01:39:01.940
Well we've decided you might be a danger the government is here to break us and I'm telling you folks if you don't wake up and realize how much trouble we're in it's all over

01:39:01.940 --> 01:39:08.940
This transcends liberal conservative garbage it's down to freedom versus slavery let's talk to Kim in Florida Kim you're on the air

01:39:08.940 --> 01:39:21.940
Hello Alex I just want to say the same exact thing that people better wake up because it's unbelievable I just had a very recent visit from ATF

01:39:21.940 --> 01:39:29.940
They I wasn't home at the time but they knew exactly where I was even the name of the company that I work at

01:39:29.940 --> 01:39:39.940
Oh it's incredible I had the ATF like a decade ago say that a gun I had didn't have a right serial number randomly they wanted me to come down there

01:39:39.940 --> 01:39:44.940
And it's just a way to harass you if you're not a Mexican drug cartel ship the narcotics and you're a bad guy

01:39:44.940 --> 01:39:51.940
And now it is a purge we are the new criminals they want to fill all their new private presence it's us the gun owners

01:39:51.940 --> 01:39:56.940
And we're in trouble the cops want to keep their jobs they'll put us in jail all day long

01:39:56.940 --> 01:40:07.940
Oh yeah and you know we were led to believe like ATF works with the police and when we did some inquiring they said well we don't know what ATF is doing

01:40:07.940 --> 01:40:09.940
They could be doing whatever they want to do

01:40:09.940 --> 01:40:12.940
What was their claim we need to check a serial number or something?

01:40:12.940 --> 01:40:18.940
No I guess because we had purchased several guns in a short period of time

01:40:18.940 --> 01:40:27.940
Oh yeah that's the new thing if you buy even a hundred rounds of ammo they come and visit you like you're dirty and create a bad it's all harassment

01:40:27.940 --> 01:40:33.940
I mean I see the reports all over the news where a veteran visited after he bought two new rifles

01:40:33.940 --> 01:40:43.940
And again it's all about you're bad you're the perp you're a criminal you did something wrong it's this new psychology that we're now going to learn how to do the perp walk

01:40:43.940 --> 01:40:47.940
That's what TSA is all about learning about lining up learn about them putting their hands on you

01:40:47.940 --> 01:40:54.940
Where I live now has TSA checkpoints totally illegal violates the tenth amendment the fourth amendment they don't care

01:40:54.940 --> 01:41:07.940
Yeah and my whole reason for calling today is what would be your advice on how to deal with this situation because at the time I wasn't home and they spoke to my husband

01:41:07.940 --> 01:41:14.940
Which I was the one that purchased the firearms and as far as I'm concerned they got all the information they needed to know

01:41:14.940 --> 01:41:22.940
That's exactly it you say this isn't a straw purchase I bought the guns for us but I bought them legal and lawfully

01:41:22.940 --> 01:41:31.940
You're here to try to create a criminal account a criminal file on us you know full well so just get on out of here

01:41:31.940 --> 01:41:38.940
And again these are the ones that ship the guns to Mexico and outside of law they tell it was the gun shop that did it to you

01:41:38.940 --> 01:41:44.940
When you buy two or more and they wanted a law two years ago they couldn't get it passed so they just did it extra legislatively

01:41:44.940 --> 01:41:52.940
This is a big issue now they're saying they may just ban guns without a law just with a rule making and that's what they do

01:41:52.940 --> 01:41:58.940
And then they think you're ignorant most of these gun arrests I'm seeing for a flash suppressor or something they're not even illegal

01:41:58.940 --> 01:42:06.940
But the juries are so stupid they'll put you in jail for a wrong statute and the lawyers are also corrupt

01:42:06.940 --> 01:42:13.940
They'll put you in jail and make you think you got a deal they want to give gun owners a record I'm telling you folks it's a criminal purge

01:42:13.940 --> 01:42:19.940
And listen you could turn your guns in they're not gonna stop they're gonna take look listen

01:42:19.940 --> 01:42:26.940
The heirs and others that were Obama's mentors this came out in trials we played the video clip of it being broken down

01:42:26.940 --> 01:42:31.940
They said we're gonna put 50 million Americans in forced labor and we're gonna kill 25 million of them

01:42:31.940 --> 01:42:38.940
Their goal is to put us in camps and blow our heads off I mean they want to do what they did in the Soviet Union and they will do it

01:42:38.940 --> 01:42:44.940
And the neo cons are all a bunch of Trotskyites who helped Trotsky do what he did and they all ran over here

01:42:44.940 --> 01:42:50.940
As Stalin kicked them out they're gonna try the same thing these are authoritarians folks this isn't rhetoric

01:42:50.940 --> 01:42:58.940

The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse

01:46:07.940 --> 01:46:14.940

We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center

01:47:21.940 --> 01:47:26.940
Thomas Jefferson said the level of tyranny that you will live under is the exact amount you put up with

01:47:26.940 --> 01:47:30.940
The government is run by real live authoritarians

01:47:30.940 --> 01:47:34.940
Who have robbed countless third world countries, the IMF and World Bank

01:47:34.940 --> 01:47:37.940
They want to re-educate America

01:47:37.940 --> 01:47:42.940
They want to start a civil war, Homeland Security was set up for the American people

01:47:42.940 --> 01:47:43.940
It's a lot bigger than Obama

01:47:43.940 --> 01:47:45.940
This is a long term strategic plan

01:47:45.940 --> 01:47:49.940
The reason the Republican leadership is going along with all this globalism

01:47:49.940 --> 01:47:53.940
Is because they're bought and paid for by Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and others

01:47:53.940 --> 01:47:57.940
Now I'm not saying this year they're going to come arrest all the gun owners

01:47:57.940 --> 01:47:59.940
Though they're harassing them and arresting veterans

01:47:59.940 --> 01:48:02.940
In fact, here's one of the articles right here

01:48:02.940 --> 01:48:06.940
It was just up on Infowars.com, I actually was doing a search on it

01:48:06.940 --> 01:48:10.940
Where army veteran arrested for 30-pound mag in New York State

01:48:10.940 --> 01:48:13.940
Faces five felonies, had no criminal record

01:48:13.940 --> 01:48:15.940
Those mags are illegal now

01:48:15.940 --> 01:48:18.940
And people are saying, well we're going to defy it

01:48:18.940 --> 01:48:20.940
And gun shops are saying, we're going to protest

01:48:20.940 --> 01:48:22.940
They're like, good, we'll fill the prisons

01:48:22.940 --> 01:48:24.940
And they will, they don't care

01:48:24.940 --> 01:48:28.940
It's up to juries to nullify unconstitutional laws

01:48:28.940 --> 01:48:31.940
And it's time for these politicians to start getting arrested

01:48:31.940 --> 01:48:34.940
They're setting themselves up as God

01:48:34.940 --> 01:48:35.940
It happens everywhere else

01:48:35.940 --> 01:48:37.940
Look how decadent America is

01:48:37.940 --> 01:48:40.940
But we're not all individually decadent

01:48:40.940 --> 01:48:42.940
And they think America's dumb

01:48:42.940 --> 01:48:44.940
They think we're done

01:48:44.940 --> 01:48:45.940
They think they can take over

01:48:45.940 --> 01:48:49.940
And I'm telling you, they're saying gun owners are responsible for all crime

01:48:49.940 --> 01:48:52.940
We're Nazis, we're scum, we're trash

01:48:52.940 --> 01:48:55.940
The government needs to defeat us

01:48:55.940 --> 01:48:58.940
This is the nomenclature

01:48:58.940 --> 01:49:02.940
Hitler didn't even say things about Jews like that

01:49:02.940 --> 01:49:04.940
Until he'd been in office two or three years

01:49:04.940 --> 01:49:07.940
He didn't even write things that radical

01:49:07.940 --> 01:49:10.940
They're saying things publicly

01:49:10.940 --> 01:49:14.940
That Stalin didn't even say about groups he was wiping out

01:49:14.940 --> 01:49:16.940
So we're being demonized

01:49:16.940 --> 01:49:19.940
I mean, can you imagine if they got up on the TV

01:49:19.940 --> 01:49:21.940
And called black people the n-word

01:49:21.940 --> 01:49:23.940
When they're calling whites crackers

01:49:23.940 --> 01:49:24.940
Whites are on there to create division

01:49:24.940 --> 01:49:26.940
And they're calling gun owners Nazis

01:49:26.940 --> 01:49:28.940
You're being demonized

01:49:28.940 --> 01:49:30.940
But you have American hospitality

01:49:30.940 --> 01:49:33.940
You're like, oh shucks, go ahead now

01:49:33.940 --> 01:49:35.940
And I mean, it's flooding in

01:49:35.940 --> 01:49:38.940
People buying ammo are getting ATF visits

01:49:38.940 --> 01:49:40.940
And they go to people with no criminal records

01:49:40.940 --> 01:49:43.940
Upstanding members of the society

01:49:43.940 --> 01:49:45.940
I even saw an article where they visited a cop's house

01:49:45.940 --> 01:49:47.940
Who bought 500 rounds of ammo

01:49:47.940 --> 01:49:50.940
It's the idea that we're all bad, government's good

01:49:50.940 --> 01:49:53.940
And the small federal family, as they call it

01:49:53.940 --> 01:49:55.940
Janet calls it the federal family

01:49:55.940 --> 01:49:57.940
What are they, Sicilian?

01:49:57.940 --> 01:50:00.940
I mean, it's just amazing

01:50:00.940 --> 01:50:03.940
Michael, Ian, Genesee, you're on the air

01:50:03.940 --> 01:50:05.940
Thanks for holding

01:50:05.940 --> 01:50:07.940
Yes, I had a really quick idea

01:50:07.940 --> 01:50:10.940
I think you ought to put a news sticker

01:50:10.940 --> 01:50:13.940
At the bottom of your new screen there

01:50:13.940 --> 01:50:15.940
That has the Bill of Rights

01:50:15.940 --> 01:50:17.940
Or you could also put the Constitution

01:50:17.940 --> 01:50:19.940
Because I'm an avid reader

01:50:19.940 --> 01:50:20.940
I know a lot of people read

01:50:20.940 --> 01:50:22.940
And you have a lot of information

01:50:22.940 --> 01:50:24.940
And this way it would just kind of

01:50:24.940 --> 01:50:27.940
Nail it into these people's heads

01:50:27.940 --> 01:50:29.940
I agree, you're talking about on the TV show

01:50:29.940 --> 01:50:31.940
Start having a scroll?

01:50:31.940 --> 01:50:33.940
Yes

01:50:33.940 --> 01:50:34.940
That makes sense

01:50:34.940 --> 01:50:37.940
What do you think about the accelerating gun purge?

01:50:37.940 --> 01:50:39.940
Change and all that

01:50:39.940 --> 01:50:41.940
I'm sorry, caller?

01:50:41.940 --> 01:50:43.940
I said yes, you know, like they do

01:50:43.940 --> 01:50:47.940
A news sticker for the New York Stock Exchange

01:50:47.940 --> 01:50:49.940
And they do updates and all that

01:50:49.940 --> 01:50:53.940
On the Bill of Rights or the Constitution

01:50:53.940 --> 01:50:55.940
Is that what you called in about?

01:50:55.940 --> 01:50:57.940
Yes, that was one of the things

01:50:57.940 --> 01:50:59.940
And the other thing is

01:50:59.940 --> 01:51:02.940
You know, I remembered watching a movie

01:51:02.940 --> 01:51:06.940
Where it was called Kingdom of Heaven or something

01:51:06.940 --> 01:51:09.940
And the knight had everyone kneel

01:51:09.940 --> 01:51:12.940
And he said, as of this day, I'm knighting

01:51:12.940 --> 01:51:15.940
You all just get out on one knee and make this vote

01:51:15.940 --> 01:51:18.940
I think deputies ought to just deputize

01:51:18.940 --> 01:51:21.940
Their public like Barney Fife

01:51:21.940 --> 01:51:23.940
And Andy Griffith used to do

01:51:23.940 --> 01:51:26.940
The problem is they've taken over most of the police departments

01:51:26.940 --> 01:51:28.940
We've got a lot of good sheriff's departments

01:51:28.940 --> 01:51:30.940
Because they at least know about the Constitution

01:51:30.940 --> 01:51:32.940
And they're elected, that's the difference

01:51:32.940 --> 01:51:34.940
They want to represent the people more and more

01:51:34.940 --> 01:51:36.940
It's time for all of us to deputize ourselves

01:51:36.940 --> 01:51:38.940
Before God and country

01:51:38.940 --> 01:51:40.940
To understand real authoritarianism

01:51:40.940 --> 01:51:42.940
Has come to our shores

01:51:42.940 --> 01:51:44.940
And the globalists think they can totally take over

01:51:44.940 --> 01:51:45.940
God bless you Michael

01:51:45.940 --> 01:51:47.940
Let's go to Dan in Pennsylvania

01:51:47.940 --> 01:51:49.940
Dan, you're on the air, welcome

01:51:49.940 --> 01:51:50.940
Hey, how are you doing Alex

01:51:50.940 --> 01:51:51.940
Good sir, thanks

01:51:51.940 --> 01:51:52.940
You and your crew

01:51:52.940 --> 01:51:53.940
Thank you for holding

01:51:53.940 --> 01:51:55.940
Yeah, I just was wondering if

01:51:55.940 --> 01:52:00.940
If you've seen House Resolution that was introduced 437

01:52:00.940 --> 01:52:03.940
It's the assault weapons ban of 2013

01:52:03.940 --> 01:52:05.940
And also 449

01:52:05.940 --> 01:52:09.940
It helps, it provides amnesty for the veterans

01:52:09.940 --> 01:52:11.940
To turn in their guns

01:52:11.940 --> 01:52:13.940
And register them and for other purposes

01:52:13.940 --> 01:52:15.940
It's really draconian

01:52:15.940 --> 01:52:17.940
I know, I know, it talks about

01:52:17.940 --> 01:52:21.940
There's a bunch of gun confiscation and assault weapons bans in there

01:52:21.940 --> 01:52:24.940
It was in Feinstein's first version

01:52:24.940 --> 01:52:26.940
And it's got language in it

01:52:26.940 --> 01:52:28.940
People understand, they're like

01:52:28.940 --> 01:52:30.940
We just want to have reasonable background checks

01:52:30.940 --> 01:52:32.940
And they've got gun bans

01:52:32.940 --> 01:52:34.940
Where you've got to turn them in like New York just passed

01:52:34.940 --> 01:52:36.940
Their goal is take our guns

01:52:36.940 --> 01:52:38.940
While they sit there going, we don't want to take your guns

01:52:38.940 --> 01:52:41.940
We don't want to take your guns, they've done that everywhere

01:52:41.940 --> 01:52:44.940
You know, they're now taking the single shots and bolt actions in Australia

01:52:44.940 --> 01:52:46.940
See, first they take the semi-auto

01:52:46.940 --> 01:52:47.940
Then they take everything

01:52:47.940 --> 01:52:50.940
What was the particular bill number on that one?

01:52:50.940 --> 01:52:52.940
That was 437

01:52:52.940 --> 01:52:55.940
It's the assault weapons ban of 2013

01:52:55.940 --> 01:52:57.940
And it has the text up online

01:52:57.940 --> 01:52:59.940
But there was also one other one

01:52:59.940 --> 01:53:02.940
It's the House Resolution 40, I believe

01:53:02.940 --> 01:53:04.940
I was trying to find it online again

01:53:04.940 --> 01:53:05.940
And my computer froze

01:53:05.940 --> 01:53:06.940
Yeah, we found it, punch it up

01:53:06.940 --> 01:53:08.940
No, I've seen that one, punch it back up for TV viewers

01:53:08.940 --> 01:53:11.940
For radio listeners, just go to the Library of Congress

01:53:11.940 --> 01:53:13.940
It's HR 437

01:53:13.940 --> 01:53:17.940
I armed the military in DC

01:53:17.940 --> 01:53:19.940
There's a bill in there that says

01:53:19.940 --> 01:53:23.940
You know, to arm the military in the District of Columbia

01:53:23.940 --> 01:53:24.940
No, I know

01:53:24.940 --> 01:53:27.940
And that's like Caesar bringing his troops into Rome

01:53:27.940 --> 01:53:31.940
Look, in the NDAA bill that passed last year

01:53:31.940 --> 01:53:33.940
To supposedly reform it

01:53:33.940 --> 01:53:35.940
It continues the secret arrest provision

01:53:35.940 --> 01:53:37.940
And just gets rid of posse commentatis

01:53:37.940 --> 01:53:39.940
That's what I'm telling people, folks

01:53:39.940 --> 01:53:41.940
They are going whole hog

01:53:41.940 --> 01:53:43.940
Republicans have gotten real scared

01:53:43.940 --> 01:53:44.940
Yes sir, we'll do whatever we're told

01:53:44.940 --> 01:53:45.940
You're right, we're bad

01:53:45.940 --> 01:53:46.940
You're right, you've got a mandate

01:53:46.940 --> 01:53:49.940
It's because it is hammer down

01:53:49.940 --> 01:53:51.940
I mean, I've never been this concerned

01:53:51.940 --> 01:53:53.940
This is not a game

01:53:53.940 --> 01:53:56.940
This is a revolution by foreign banks

01:53:56.940 --> 01:53:57.940
This is espionage

01:53:57.940 --> 01:53:58.940
God bless you

01:53:58.940 --> 01:53:59.940
Yes, thank you for bringing that up

01:53:59.940 --> 01:54:01.940
Yes, I'm aware of it

01:54:01.940 --> 01:54:04.940
That's what I'm telling people

01:54:04.940 --> 01:54:06.940
This isn't a game

01:54:06.940 --> 01:54:10.940
By the way, you can buy the February issue of Infowars Magazine

01:54:10.940 --> 01:54:12.940
On the cover it says

01:54:12.940 --> 01:54:13.940
Why the tyrants want your guns

01:54:13.940 --> 01:54:17.940
About 80% of the 60 page glossy magazine is on that subject

01:54:17.940 --> 01:54:19.940
It explains how they're going to take your guns

01:54:19.940 --> 01:54:21.940
Why they want to take your guns

01:54:21.940 --> 01:54:22.940
Their strategy to do it

01:54:22.940 --> 01:54:23.940
Their strategy to beat them

01:54:23.940 --> 01:54:26.940
It is available at InfowarsStore.com

01:54:26.940 --> 01:54:28.940

01:54:30.940 --> 01:54:31.940
Also gets you there

01:54:31.940 --> 01:54:32.940
And it's at cost

01:54:32.940 --> 01:54:34.940
You can buy them in groups of 10

01:54:34.940 --> 01:54:35.940
Up to 100

01:54:35.940 --> 01:54:38.940
In fact, John Bowne was at the public library

01:54:38.940 --> 01:54:39.940
Getting books for his daughter yesterday

01:54:39.940 --> 01:54:40.940
And said he saw a stack of them

01:54:40.940 --> 01:54:41.940
Somebody put in there

01:54:41.940 --> 01:54:42.940
So good job folks

01:54:42.940 --> 01:54:44.940
You can also get subscriptions at cost

01:54:44.940 --> 01:54:46.940
And you can give subscriptions

01:54:46.940 --> 01:54:48.940
Give subscriptions to people you want to wake up

01:54:48.940 --> 01:54:49.940
Imagine 12 issues

01:54:49.940 --> 01:54:52.940
Good chance of waking them up

01:54:52.940 --> 01:54:54.940

Or call 888-253-3139

We've brought back the Obama Joker Tyrant shirt

01:54:59.940 --> 01:55:00.940
Redesigned

01:55:00.940 --> 01:55:02.940
Because the first one was a limited edition

01:55:02.940 --> 01:55:03.940
Show is this one

01:55:03.940 --> 01:55:04.940
Your purchase supports the broadcast

01:55:04.940 --> 01:55:07.940
Let's talk to Zach in Tennessee

01:55:07.940 --> 01:55:10.940
Zach in Tennessee

01:55:10.940 --> 01:55:11.940
You are on the air

01:55:11.940 --> 01:55:13.940
Zach, what is on your mind today?

01:55:13.940 --> 01:55:14.940
Yes sir

01:55:14.940 --> 01:55:16.940
I was just holding from earlier

01:55:16.940 --> 01:55:17.940
But I was going to tell you

01:55:17.940 --> 01:55:19.940
Did you see the Bill Gates article

01:55:19.940 --> 01:55:21.940
That he doesn't care about money

01:55:21.940 --> 01:55:22.940
And he goes on to say

01:55:22.940 --> 01:55:24.940
He's spiritual but doesn't believe in religion

01:55:24.940 --> 01:55:26.940
Did you see that one?

01:55:26.940 --> 01:55:27.940
Yes I did

01:55:27.940 --> 01:55:28.940
Yes I did

01:55:28.940 --> 01:55:30.940
They're bringing in an entire system

01:55:30.940 --> 01:55:31.940
We'll look more into that

01:55:31.940 --> 01:55:32.940
I'm telling you

01:55:32.940 --> 01:55:33.940
It's a total global revolution

01:55:33.940 --> 01:55:34.940
Ladies and gentlemen

01:55:34.940 --> 01:55:36.940
Designing high tech to enslave us

01:55:36.940 --> 01:55:37.940
Not to empower us

01:55:37.940 --> 01:55:38.940
It's a total blueprint

01:55:38.940 --> 01:55:40.940
It's called a technocracy

01:55:40.940 --> 01:55:41.940
In their own words

01:55:41.940 --> 01:55:43.940
Let's talk to Zane in FEMA Region 3

01:55:43.940 --> 01:55:45.940
Formerly Virginia

01:55:45.940 --> 01:55:47.940
Now globalist occupied territory

01:55:47.940 --> 01:55:48.940
Go ahead Zane

01:55:48.940 --> 01:55:49.940
You're welcome to the airwaves

01:55:49.940 --> 01:55:50.940
Hey Alex

01:55:50.940 --> 01:55:51.940
How's it going?

01:55:51.940 --> 01:55:52.940
Pretty good

01:55:52.940 --> 01:55:53.940
I read an article

01:55:53.940 --> 01:55:55.940
I work in one of the few factories

01:55:55.940 --> 01:55:56.940
Left here in Virginia

01:55:56.940 --> 01:55:59.940
And someone had posted this article

01:55:59.940 --> 01:56:01.940
It was out of a magazine

01:56:01.940 --> 01:56:02.940
And it was saying that

01:56:02.940 --> 01:56:04.940
The way they're going to get the gun grab

01:56:04.940 --> 01:56:05.940
Is they're going to make it

01:56:05.940 --> 01:56:07.940
Where you can't afford to have a gun

01:56:07.940 --> 01:56:09.940
They're going to make you get insurance

01:56:09.940 --> 01:56:10.940
On your guns

01:56:10.940 --> 01:56:11.940
Have you heard anything about that?

01:56:11.940 --> 01:56:12.940
Yes, no

01:56:12.940 --> 01:56:14.940
They've got state and federal bills

01:56:14.940 --> 01:56:15.940
Insurance is a power to tax

01:56:15.940 --> 01:56:17.940
The power to tax is the power to destroy

01:56:17.940 --> 01:56:20.940
They're hitting us with a thousand torpedoes right now

01:56:20.940 --> 01:56:23.940
They're hitting us from every single angle

01:56:23.940 --> 01:56:25.940
And we've got to take their attack

01:56:25.940 --> 01:56:27.940
And show how they're authoritarians

01:56:27.940 --> 01:56:28.940
With bodyguards

01:56:28.940 --> 01:56:30.940
And how they've taken guns everywhere else

01:56:30.940 --> 01:56:32.940
And how this is a plan to enslave us

01:56:32.940 --> 01:56:33.940
And turn it back on them

01:56:33.940 --> 01:56:35.940
We have to go on the offense

01:56:35.940 --> 01:56:36.940
Or we're going to lose everything

01:56:36.940 --> 01:56:37.940
Well that's for sure

01:56:37.940 --> 01:56:39.940
I am sick and I am tired

01:56:39.940 --> 01:56:41.940
And everybody that hears this

01:56:41.940 --> 01:56:43.940
Needs to be sick and tired

01:56:43.940 --> 01:56:44.940
Exactly

01:56:44.940 --> 01:56:46.940
I mean we are being enslaved

01:56:46.940 --> 01:56:48.940
Being upset is what got us our liberty

01:56:48.940 --> 01:56:50.940
We need to get upset and awake again

01:56:50.940 --> 01:56:51.940
God bless you

01:56:51.940 --> 01:56:52.940
And I meant to get to this

01:56:52.940 --> 01:56:53.940
And I didn't

01:56:53.940 --> 01:56:54.940
I'll cover it tomorrow on the weekday show

01:56:54.940 --> 01:56:56.940
NRA winning the influence battle

01:56:56.940 --> 01:56:58.940
Over gun control

01:56:58.940 --> 01:56:59.940
Appinions

01:56:59.940 --> 01:57:00.940
Appinions

01:57:00.940 --> 01:57:02.940
Is one of the biggest data mining

01:57:02.940 --> 01:57:03.940
Public groups

01:57:03.940 --> 01:57:07.940
And the company breaks down

01:57:07.940 --> 01:57:09.940
Off a variety of data mining

01:57:09.940 --> 01:57:10.940
What they found

01:57:10.940 --> 01:57:12.940
And they have found that second amendment advocates

01:57:12.940 --> 01:57:15.940
Are absolutely trouncing the gun grabbers

01:57:15.940 --> 01:57:16.940
And this is a

01:57:16.940 --> 01:57:18.940
Again non-partisan

01:57:18.940 --> 01:57:20.940
Non-political analysis of it

01:57:20.940 --> 01:57:22.940
And it says gun rights advocates

01:57:22.940 --> 01:57:24.940
Have more stamina than gun control advocates

01:57:24.940 --> 01:57:27.940
Gun rights advocates show military coordination

01:57:27.940 --> 01:57:28.940
With laser focus

01:57:28.940 --> 01:57:30.940
Well yeah because we're people that actually work

01:57:30.940 --> 01:57:31.940
And live in the real world

01:57:31.940 --> 01:57:34.940
Any mainline person that supports gun control

01:57:34.940 --> 01:57:35.940
Who isn't a tyrant

01:57:35.940 --> 01:57:37.940
Is just a jellyfish

01:57:37.940 --> 01:57:38.940
They think the government loves them

01:57:38.940 --> 01:57:39.940
And wants to help them

01:57:39.940 --> 01:57:42.940
Government wants to inject you with cancer viruses

01:57:42.940 --> 01:57:43.940
And put you six feet under

01:57:43.940 --> 01:57:44.940
After you're done working

01:57:44.940 --> 01:57:46.940
Alright I'll see you back tomorrow

01:57:46.940 --> 01:57:48.940
11am central info wars dot com

01:57:48.940 --> 01:58:04.940
Great job crew
