1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
You want answers?

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Well, so does he.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It is 2013.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We are here, at least on the Gregorian calendar.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The Chinese New Year, I guess, starts in about a month.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
It'll be the fitting year of the snake.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Year of the New World Order.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And I guess the Age of Aquarius has kicked off as well.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The Illuminati believes that they are about to ascend to power.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Whether you believe in that or not, they believe in it.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And that is why they are moving on every single front.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Again, ladies and gentlemen, we are live here.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And we are going to be here for the next three hours on this New Year's Day.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The globalists are not just gonna try to strangle the Second Amendment.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Using the deaths of the poor children at Sandy Hook.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
They are going to annihilate publicly the entire Bill of Rights and Constitution.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
And basically have a political orgy in the blood.

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And here is one of the headlines.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Democrats crank up death panel talk following Obama win.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
That's a curtain, MOMfallwars.com headline.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Here's the actual slate headline by a George Soros operative.

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
The case for death panels.

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Remember the headline in, what was it, Newsweek?

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The case for killing Granny.

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
While they, but that was after Obamacare passed.

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Before they said, conspiracy theory, we would never.

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
That is preposterous.

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Wayne LaPierre comes out and says, we need to arm the school teachers like Israel.

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
That stopped their mass shootings in schools.

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
That's ridiculous.

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Israel doesn't have any guns.

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Guns are outlawed there.

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Talking to you like you've got a 55 IQ.

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And you know what, it works on people.

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Because the average person isn't even so much stupid as they're incredibly coddling and

39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
lazy.

40
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And just get into, the hype, the soap opera, the cover of People Magazine, the dead children,

41
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
tuning in and lighting candles.

42
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
But if you go, hey, they're killing kids with drones.

43
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Hey, thousands die a year from the inoculations in the US alone.

44
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Tens of thousands of kids per Asian country get paralyzed with a polio shot.

45
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Shut up, extremist.

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It doesn't exist.

47
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
See if there's any inkling of responsibility for jellyfish people, they say it doesn't

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
exist.

49
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,000
But if it's like the big mainstream media, time to get sad, time to get upset, time to

50
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
do something, let's do something right now.

51
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:13,500
And so you've got the domesticated mass literally sucking their Prozac thumbs, sitting on their

52
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,600
Prozac thumbs, looking at us.

53
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,920
The people that at least know that we're in deep trouble and the society's in a very decadent

54
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,920
downward spiral.

55
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:27,600
And they're looking at us going, men with guns, go get their guns, they shouldn't have

56
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,600
them.

57
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,600
I'm scared of them with guns, but I like your black uniform.

58
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:38,000
I like it, I like checkpoints, it makes me feel safe.

59
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,680
Hey, did you know government killed 260 plus million people?

60
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:47,560
Measuring university studies like University of Hawaii?

61
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:54,400
Whatever conspiracy there is, there's no death panels, but there are.

62
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,400
So here it is, the case for death panels.

63
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,620
There's a bunch of articles outgoing, you wanna fix the economy, kill old people.

64
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:08,160
And so I wanna after a special guest, remember Susanna Hupp, who was one of the Luby's Massacre

65
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,520
Survivors, former state rep after that.

66
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:14,760
Old talk show host on our local affiliate 590 AM, and she's gonna be popping in later

67
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,840
in the second hour of about 15, 20 minutes.

68
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:21,400
Remember she testified to Congress, she said, we have our guns to protect us from you, they're

69
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,280
not for duck hunting.

70
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,320
So yeah, that's the lady, she's gonna be joining us, a fellow Texan.

71
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:32,360
But other than that, we're gonna have open phones today and I'm going to wait till later

72
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:38,040
in the broadcast to get into agenda 21 and what it really means, how it means eugenics,

73
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,040
how it means death panels.

74
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,880
So that is all coming up today.

75
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:50,560
And they're also declaring war on the Constitution, calling it evil.

76
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:56,080
The Obama noise are so like a case of hemorrhoids, the Obama noise will be right back or worse

77
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:01,200
than hemorrhoids, I actually.

78
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:05,880
Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our

79
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,920
immunity and health.

80
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:12,520
With silver lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing a full selection of

81
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,680
silver based products.

82
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:20,040
Our most popular silver based products are the 32 ounce nano silver solutions, our two

83
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:25,760
ounce nano silver nasal applicators, as well as our all natural silver soaps.

84
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,780
Just released is our 100% natural silver gel.

85
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:34,400
Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and

86
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,280
leave the silver at the surface.

87
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:41,200
But rather, we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin nourishing chemistry

88
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:46,440
of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the silver more

89
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,120
effectively.

90
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:54,640

That's www.silverlungs.com.

93
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,440
We have witnessed two terrible storms in the east, but we are still in the eye of the perfect

94
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,440
storm.

95
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,680
The most devastating economic conditions since the Great Depression, America's worst drought

96
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,560
in agricultural history, and now the economic results of the presidential election.

97
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,840
This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.

98
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,120
I just doubled down and got even more supplies from E Foods Direct, and I recommend you do

99
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,120
the same.

100
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,800
It's time to get your own supply from E Foods Direct.

101
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,400
I know I won't be standing in a bread line trading my freedom for food.

102
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,800
I'm taking control of my future, and you're nuts if you don't do the same.

103
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,840
Go to efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex to find the specials, and you can start with

104
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,360
a holiday gift pack that's normally $80, now under $50.

105
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:50,120
Remember, I can warn you, but I can't feed you, call 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com

106
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,120
forward slash Alex.

107
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,720
Would you rather prepare six months too early or one day too late?

108
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:02,720
Call 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.

109
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:31,040
E Foods can reduce fluoride up to 95%, easy to set up and use, doesn't require electricity,

110
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,360
purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.

111
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,520
This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.

112
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:42,120
Save money by not buying bottled water and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.

113
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,560
Propure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.

114
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,560
It's what my family uses.

115
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,840
Infowars.com already has the lowest price on Propure, but if you add the promo code

116
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:55,240
water at checkout, you get an additional 10% off at infowars.com.

117
00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:05,760
You can also call to order 888-253-3139.

118
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:11,800
We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.

119
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:20,240
You are listening to the Alex Jones Show.

120
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,800
Here we are, ladies and gentlemen.

121
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,800
We are live.

122
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:30,680
It is the first day of January, 2013.

123
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:38,400
In the Chinese zodiac, the year of the snake kicks off on the 23rd, a fitting title.

124
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:42,280
And for the globalist, it is to tyranny and beyond.

125
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,760
You know, Buzz Lightyear says to infinity and beyond.

126
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:52,320
For the globalist, tyranny is just the beginning of their absolute takeover and re-engineering

127
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,600
of what's left of humanity in an ultimate act of complete domination.

128
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:01,960
And the globalist in all their publications brag how they have generationally worked to

129
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:09,160
take over much of the planet so that they can fully, irrevocably, savage humanity and

130
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:12,020
reduce the population down to almost nothing.

131
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:17,220
Show that they can take full control of human development and basically use those of us

132
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:23,400
that are left as playthings or as test subjects for life extension technologies and other

133
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,960
systems.

134
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:34,080
And that is what we face in 2013 is the velvet glove being taken off of the iron fist.

135
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:40,440
I had a caller yesterday who asked me, why do you sound so irritated sometimes when you

136
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,740
are taking phone calls?

137
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:49,040
And it's because of a lot of things, because sometimes I hear the rebroadcast and I sound

138
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:54,920
friendly and nice and answer the questions and I'm congenial.

139
00:09:54,920 --> 00:10:00,200
Other times I hear rebroadcast occasionally when I can stomach listening to myself.

140
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:05,120
And I sound pained, I sound rude.

141
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:13,840
And it's really because I am exhausted at many core levels, but also energized at core

142
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,120
levels.

143
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:21,280
So I've got a big heart for the fight against the globalist, but physically, especially

144
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:26,720
I don't get enough sleep or don't eat enough, or I get overly angry at the globalist.

145
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:34,800
I tend to kind of overheat like a race car engine and well, explode.

146
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,240
And so that's the answer to the fellow's question as I thought about that last night.

147
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:44,200
And I've had this as a resolution many times because back when I was first on talk radio

148
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:49,040
17 years ago, I was pretty much a call driven show.

149
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:55,280
I would do a two, three hour radio show every day and 80% of it was phone calls because

150
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,800
I enjoyed the phone calls.

151
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:03,240
Now I've always got so many things on my mind and so much news that I'm frustrated that

152
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:07,200
I'm not getting to all the news that I've researched and wanna cover.

153
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:14,240
I'm frustrated because of the spoken words limitations to describe fully what an article

154
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,720
or a piece of news signifies.

155
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:22,000
And I'm frustrated that I wanna take a lot of your calls, but that I then tend to not

156
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
go to your calls.

157
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,760
And when I do, they're complex questions or complex issues.

158
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:37,740
And I basically throw little mini temper tantrums because it's almost like an interrogation.

159
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,600
I love going out and meeting listeners.

160
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,040
I love going out and doing events, but at the same time, I hate it because it's very

161
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,040
exhausting.

162
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,720
If I go out and talk to a couple thousand people after an event and shake hands for

163
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:54,020
three hours and listen to their questions and listen to their comments, it's draining.

164
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:59,800
Because I actually listen to you, I actually gauge you, I actually read you as a person.

165
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:04,560
And that's very tiring.

166
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,840
And it's the same thing with all this news.

167
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,800
I mean, I researched news last night, I researched it this morning.

168
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:15,200
I have stacks over 100 articles here I wanna get into, huge piles of video clips I wanna

169
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,300
analyze.

170
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:23,120
But each article, when I pick up one of these articles or I pick up one of these quotes,

171
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:31,800
I have to summon the data in my mind associated with that information.

172
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:36,600
And so that itself is a frustrating event.

173
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:45,800
And I mean, just thinking about it right now is making me nauseated.

174
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:50,620
I'm not like running on the air, happy I've got a clip of Dianne Feinstein saying her

175
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:54,840
goal is to disarm the general population, quote, Mr. And Mrs. America.

176
00:12:54,840 --> 00:13:00,080
I already knew that was her goal and read her quotes over the years, but it's painful

177
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,240
to look at, it's painful.

178
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:08,280
And then it's painful to try to put all the evidence on display for you.

179
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,920
But enough about that, I'm gonna give the number out here and I don't want people to

180
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:15,040
call in and go, we appreciate you, you're great.

181
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,240
That's not why I'm whining about this on air.

182
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:21,800
I'm telling you about this so you'll understand where I come from, so you can put up with

183
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,800
me.

184
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,600
Some of you that get irritated by hearing the irritation of my voice, it's not with

185
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,860
you.

186
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:34,420
It's with that I know I'm right, I know that I understand the enemy.

187
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:37,900
The enemy is so arrogant, they brag about their plans everywhere.

188
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,560
And I am fundamentally upset.

189
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,860
I'm upset with the globalist, I'm upset with the general public being weak minded.

190
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:50,600
I'm upset with myself not being able to fully articulate what I know and understand.

191
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:54,240
Because if you knew what I knew, if you could see what I see, our troubles would be over

192
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,780
very, very quickly.

193
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:04,920
But then I realized the general public is literally being swallowed by fraud.

194
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:12,400
The alternative media, as bad as it is, because at least it's real and it's human.

195
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:18,420
When the globalists try to inject cognitive infiltration that Cass Sunstein talked about

196
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:22,700
at the White House in to create infighting and kind of a background noise to nullify

197
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,700
us.

198
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:28,580
But it still isn't working because there's an over driving human survival instinct that

199
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:38,900
still beats in the most unconscious of people.

200
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:45,420
But my goal is to really try to awaken humanity and to try to reverse our course.

201
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:48,980
Because the course we're headed on is oblivion.

202
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:58,660
It is anathema to everything good and wholesome.

203
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:02,820
People say, why does evil always get in control throughout time?

204
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:07,900
Because it has the desire for the power.

205
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:14,340
And I study the scientific crafting of the system where they roll out certain technologies

206
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,940
and certain systems.

207
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:24,020
And then we beg and clamor and pay for them as status symbols when they are tools of control.

208
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:34,380
But then to even reach in to the matrix, proto-matrix system that the general public has already

209
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:39,660
fallen to, you must use the tools of the enemy.

210
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:44,980
I am not against technology, but again to use a Lord of the Rings analogy because that

211
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:49,660
seems to get through to people.

212
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:56,100
Rings are made for all the races in Middle Earth, for the elves, for the dwarves, for

213
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:59,140
the men.

214
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:09,260
The rings are made by the older creations of the entity, the god that created the universe.

215
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:15,300
So it basically has kind of a Christian timeline in Tolkien's writings.

216
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:19,820
If you get deeper into it, it's an analogy, an allegory.

217
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:24,300
And the rings are forged, and the nine rings are given to men, and a certain amount are

218
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,900
given to the elves and the dwarves.

219
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:34,980
And they have incredible power in them inherently, and it's given to them by an angelic creature.

220
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:47,420
But the angelic creature has decided to become destructive, Lucifer, Morgoth against Mordor.

221
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:54,220
And Morgoth falls and is reincarnated as Sauron, but the point is that the rings are given

222
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:58,500
and you take the rings, you take the cell phone, you take the smart meter.

223
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,940
You go into the gym and they go, discount if you thumbprint to sign up.

224
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:06,900
And you do it all Pavlovianly set up like a chicken pecking a tic-tac-toe machine to

225
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,640
get grain.

226
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:16,140
And it is a system of total control designed to get you into an electronic straitjacket

227
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:21,060
to cut off self-sufficiency, to shut down the family farms, to make you dependent, to

228
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:27,420
bring you into model compact 2021 cities that are advertised again as cool and fun.

229
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:34,220
To then have a controlled bioweapon attacks that are released as people go into more authoritarian

230
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:38,760
control in the name of avoiding the biological warfare attacks that they claim terrorists

231
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:42,140
are going to launch.

232
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:48,360
As we sit there huddled in our compact cities, watching the general third world population

233
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:54,860
wiped out in the future, you need to understand that it is the globalist orchestrating all

234
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:55,860
of this.

235
00:17:55,860 --> 00:18:01,340
And anything they give you, anything we use, anything in our culture that has been rolled

236
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:10,460
out and promoted by the system is a ring of power.

237
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:15,060
You guys print me the intro to the Lord of the Rings book.

238
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:19,740
It's one ring to bind them in the darkness, bind them.

239
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:22,360
I want that full quote when we come back if we can.

240
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:26,360
One ring to rule them all, because that's really what it is.

241
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,040
And in the darkness bind them.

242
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:33,700
We are fighting adherence of death and destruction and ugliness.

243
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:37,260
It is what they resonate with, it is what they will create.

244
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:42,420
And it's in their globalist literature, it's in everything they say, everything they do.

245
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:47,160
And so later I'm gonna get into that, I'm gonna get into top professors demonizing the

246
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,920
Constitution and calling it evil and saying get rid of it.

247
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:55,340
They're openly saying yes, kill the old people now, all over the news.

248
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:57,940
You see, they're not just gonna go after the guns.

249
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:03,180
The fact that they're going after them and saying openly we want you to turn them in

250
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:10,380
is the signal that the real third act has begun.

251
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:15,140
And if you look at the arrogance and the fire in the enemy's eyes right now, they're on

252
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,940
the march.

253
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:21,300
They have decided to drop the hammer and I can tell you, along with that will be false

254
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:26,160
flag stage terror attacks blamed on us.

255
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,880
So you're thinking they'll never get away with this.

256
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,060
They're going to attack themselves and blame it on us.

257
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:36,980
A great time of evil is upon us, ladies and gentlemen.

258
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:39,440
And you better decide which side you're on.

259
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,900
My New Year's resolution is when I give the number out, I'm gonna take the calls.

260
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:46,600
And if I don't get to them, we're gonna wipe the phones out till I do go to calls.

261
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:53,580
We're gonna take your calls on any issue you wanna discuss straight ahead, 800-259-9231.

262
00:19:53,580 --> 00:20:02,020
It is January 1st, 2013, that'll take some getting used to, 800-259-9231.

263
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:06,860
We have witnessed two terrible storms in the east, but we are still in the eye of the perfect

264
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:07,860
storm.

265
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:11,700
The most devastating economic conditions since the Great Depression, America's worst drought

266
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:16,500
in agricultural history, and now the economic results of the presidential election.

267
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,740
This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.

268
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:23,940
I just doubled down and got even more supplies from eFoods Direct, and I recommend you do

269

270

It's time to get your own supply from eFoods Direct.

271
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:31,060
I know I won't be standing in a bread line trading my freedom for food.

272
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:35,420
I'm taking control of my future, and you're nuts if you don't do the same.

Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

303
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:34,820
Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold

304
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:35,820
IRAs?

305
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:39,900
They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value

306
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,580
of gold for your retirement.

307
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:44,980
Gold is outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:50,060

311
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,900
Hi there.

312
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:01,900
My name is Frank Bates.

313
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:06,180
What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble.

314
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:12,420
I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity

315
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:17,180
monopolies and government agencies for what they really are, incompetent line crooks that

316
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:22,260
are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high.

317
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:24,380
Some have called this a conspiracy.

318
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:29,100
Others have called it a cover-up, and you will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy

319
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,180
goes.

320
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:35,820
My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them

321
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:38,260
and how you can beat them too.

322
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:41,980
Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen

323
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,700
in the last three months.

324
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:49,100
Go to 123coverup.com and discover one weird trick to slash your power bill and protect

325
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,220
your home.

326
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:56,100
Go watch my video now at 123coverup.com before they force me to shut it down.

327
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,660
Again, that's 123coverup.com.

328
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:04,260
It began with the forging of the great rings.

329
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:11,820
Three were given to the elves, immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings.

330
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:19,260
Seven to the dwarf lords, great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls.

331
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:28,820
And nine, nine rings were gifted to the race of men who above all else desire power.

332
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:35,580
For within these rings was bound the strength and will to govern each race.

333
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:41,940
But they were all of them deceived, for another ring was made.

334
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:48,960
In the land of Mordor, in the fires of Mount Doom, the Dark Lord Sauron forged in secret

335
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:56,940
a master ring to control all others, and into this ring he poured his cruelty, his malice

336
00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:02,300
and his will to dominate all life.

337
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:09,060
One ring to rule them all.

338
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:17,500
Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.

339
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:25,220
It is the first day of 2013, I've been a lot of soul searching and I want to commit to

340
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:30,380
you in this year that I'm going to put out the greatest output of information and of

341
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:34,020
the highest quality that we have ever produced.

342
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:39,460
I am going to make a new official film this year, I've not announced that yet, I will

343
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:40,460
on Friday.

344
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:46,420
I meant to do it a few weeks ago but got behind, announced the biggest contest we've ever done.

345
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:52,860
It'll be $100,000 contest and it is key to our Paul Revere operation, that's what I intend

346
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:56,100
to call it, Operation Paul Revere.

347
00:25:56,100 --> 00:26:04,260
We are going to launch the TV show onto the satellites and I am going to create informational

348
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:10,580
videos on certain key subjects explaining how things work.

349
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:17,360
Only keys to unlocking the secrets of the New World Order and how to defeat them.

350
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:23,620
Because I do understand their operations, I understand all of their operations.

351
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:28,340
It does not mean that I could consciously at one time grasp the entire compendium of

352
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:29,340
their system.

353
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:34,300
But if I focus on particular sub sectors of it, I can see right down to the bone on what

354
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,760
they're doing.

355
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:42,140
Because they've published their operational manuals and only thinly veil and compartmentalize

356
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,380
their true goals.

357
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:47,140
In fact, in many cases they openly brag.

358
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:52,800
Also many of the servants of total evil are very twisted and weak people.

359
00:26:52,800 --> 00:27:00,060
And they almost reflexively in the control systems are used to dealing with the zombified

360
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:02,200
public that is in a trance state.

361
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:07,500
So those of us that are in different degrees of awakening, it's like watching people in

362
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,620
slow motion.

363
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:15,560
And so don't ever forget how much power you've really got if by the grace of God, your consciousness

364
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,540
has not been shuttered.

365
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:25,060
Again, my friends, it is Tuesday, the first day of January 2013.

366
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:31,100
We come back from break, I will go to your phone calls at 800-25-99231.

367
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,100
And just be ready.

368
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:36,000
I've said this over and over again, but it's my New Year's resolution.

369
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,780
To make your point, I'm gonna try to go to the next person.

370
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:42,220
It's just sometimes the calls are so incredible or they're breaking such amazing news.

371
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:47,120
Like the caller yesterday going, yeah, they've got hidden cameras in the VA in the smoke

372
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,060
detectors in Tampa.

373
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:51,580
And we search engine it, and there it is in the Tampa newspaper.

374
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:54,420
And they're like, we're allowed to secretly watch you.

375
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:59,700
Well, yeah, I mean, they got cameras in the bathrooms at public schools for 15 years.

376
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,740
Government issued laptops, watch you at home.

377
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:06,140
I mean, it's just all over the top.

378
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:09,300
And that's just what you know about.

379
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:14,260
I mean, I don't just get up here and say almost every vaccine they look at has cancer viruses

380
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,940
in it on purpose.

381
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:18,940
I've got the top scientist bragging.

382
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:23,820
I've played the video clips of the polio developer going, yeah, we knew we gave 100 million Americans

383
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:28,780
the first round cancer viruses and it's killed tens of millions and they laugh about it on

384
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:29,780
PBS.

385
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:34,860
On the PBS station in Boston, I mean, when you get these globalists together like on

386
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:39,260
TED TV, Bill Gates gets up there and goes, we're gonna reduce the carbon output.

387
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:43,820
That means reduce this down to zero and he puts an image of stick figures of a family

388
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:49,860
up there and the TED TV conference elitist all laugh.

389
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:53,020
They're not liberals, they're killers.

390
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:56,220
You don't get in the club unless you go, yeah, I see the public as animals.

391
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,220
I wanna kill them.

392
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:02,300
They go, good, you're part of the team, you have the will to be cold blooded and understand

393
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,420
survival of the fittest.

394
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:07,580
Know what you are is going to be used and destroyed.

395
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:16,300
I will assure you, I will assure all of you that you will be destroyed.

396
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:22,580
You will not get a seat at this table, you understand that?

397
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:26,340
One ring to rule them all, one ring to find them, one ring to bring them all and in the

398
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:27,380
darkness bind them.

399
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:33,860
Is that not the technocratic surveillance smart grid tracking everything we do?

400
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:38,660
One ring to rule them all, one ring to find them, one ring to bring them all and in the

401
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:43,540
darkness bind them for taxation and control.

402
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:46,100
They also kill you with the wireless systems as well.

403
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:49,940
Stay with us, we'll be back.

404
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:51,220
We're on the march.

405
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:53,620
The empire's on the run.

406
00:29:53,620 --> 00:30:00,940
Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

407
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:04,920
Millions of people are going to get sick this winter from colds, flu and other illnesses.

408
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,300
Don't be one of them.

409
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:11,420
Protect yourself with Supernatural Silver, a revolutionary new broad spectrum antibacterial

410
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:12,420
solution.

411
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:15,800
Recent advances in silver technology have resulted in a silver solution that can be

412
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:20,820
used daily to prevent bacteria, viruses, mold and food poisoning and help improve wound

413
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:21,820
healing.

414
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:26,060
Supernatural Silver is safe enough to consume every day while powerful enough to destroy

415
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:31,320
the causes of many serious diseases such as strep, staph, pneumonia, colds, flus and other

416
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,740
harmful pathogens.

417
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:37,600
This new technology has the ability to terminate entire colonies of harmful bacteria at several

418
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:41,740
hundred times the effectiveness of colloidal or ionic silver solutions.

419
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:45,420
The Science Digest Journal says silver is our mightiest germ fighter.

420
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:49,260
It is virtually non-toxic and is emerging as a wonder of modern medicine.

435
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:06,100
We have witnessed two terrible storms in the east but we are still in the eye of the perfect

436
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,100
storm.

437
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:11,440
The most devastating economic conditions since the Great Depression, America's worst drought

438
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:16,340
in agricultural history and now the economic results of the presidential election.

439
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:19,620
This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.

440
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:23,900
I just doubled down and got even more supplies from eFoods Direct and I recommend you do

441
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:24,900
the same.

442
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:27,540
It's time to get your own supply from eFoods Direct.

443
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:31,140
I know I won't be standing in a bread line trading my freedom for food.

444
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:35,540
I'm taking control of my future and you're nuts if you don't do the same.

445
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:39,580
Go to efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex to find the specials and you can start with

446
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:43,220
a holiday gift pack that's normally $80, now under $50.

forward slash Alex.

449
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:58,020
Would you rather prepare six months too early or one day too late, 409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com

450
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:02,020
forward slash Alex.

451
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:17,740
You've got a business, you didn't build that, somebody else made that happen.

452
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:26,900
Coming up, defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.

453
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:30,460
That's right, coming up, the defense of the republic.

454
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:33,860
Okay, I'm gonna go directly to your calls.

455
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:37,740
And then Rick Perry has signed an order that's got no attention to bring in the Trans Texas

456
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:43,500
Napa Superhighway even though our state representatives have voted it down twice.

457
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:50,100
What Mordor wants, Mordor gets until the public awakens.

458
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:55,460
And we have top Georgetown professors, advisors to Obama, saying the Constitution is just

459
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:56,820
a criminal document.

460
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,580
Those are some of the quotes.

461
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:00,240
We're gonna be going over all that.

462
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,540
They're openly announcing all over the place that we need to kill all people, get rid of

463
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:05,540
them.

464
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:11,700
I'm gonna explain to you how the collectivist model works, and there is no doubt that collectivism

465
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:12,700
is a nightmare.

466
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:16,980
It sounds good, it'll make you feel good up front at the beginning like the first time

467
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:27,020
you inject heroin, but it leads to absolute ruination and domestication and dehumanization.

468
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:31,180
But it's like the ring of power, people believe because they're good, they could have a big

469
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:33,860
government that would redistribute wealth.

470
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:38,680
My friends, the globalists that have set up collectivism and that run the world economy

471
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:46,140
are absolutely cold-blooded, exterminist, ultra-Hitlerian eugenicist.

472
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:53,300
And anything they do with taxes will be turned towards bad in the end.

473
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:57,740
And we told you that once they got health care in, they would start the death panels

474
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:00,180
because they've done it in dozens of other countries.

475
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,940
They follow a program.

476
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:08,020
We can look at scores of nations further down the line than we are.

477
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:09,020
It's a blueprint.

478
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:13,280
It's like a movie we've already seen over and over again, and that's what's so frustrating.

479
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,740
They teach the general public that everything is your opinion.

480
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:18,940
No, this is not my opinion.

481
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:23,220
This is not my opinion.

482
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:28,100
If you walk out on the top of a 50-story building without a parachute, and you jump off that

483
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:35,740
thing and swan dive towards the concrete below, you are going to die.

484
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:39,020
That is not my opinion.

485
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:45,500
And if you let the globalists execute their plan, it's like steps downwards into hell.

486
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:51,380
We know where each step goes, just like a detailed road map.

487
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:53,460
There is no debate.

488
00:35:53,460 --> 00:36:00,380
I'm going to go to your phone calls.

489
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:02,820
Justin in Missouri, you're on the air.

490
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:03,820
Welcome.

491
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:05,900
Hey, thanks for taking my call.

492
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:10,740
I just wanted to ask you what you think they're going to sneak into that fiscal negotiation

493
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,540
regarding the Second Amendment.

494
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,700
Oh, that's a good point.

495
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:18,380
They can have the government shut down, the welfare checks, or credits not be put on the

496
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:19,380
cards.

497
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:27,500
And then Feinstein, who is key on the committee to be able to control what bills can go in

498
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:34,180
and out or what agreements, they're saying that her bill, she's the one that wrote it

499
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:38,580
and got it rammed through with Biden in 1993, they're saying it's her bill.

500
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:44,620
I mean, she's the person that Obama's going to hand the ball to, she's the running back.

501
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:51,340
And they're running the play to try to engage in 100-yard drive against us, and they intend

502
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:52,340
to do it.

503
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:56,100
And again, the fiscal clip has been done in Iceland, everywhere else, we said this was

504
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,100
coming.

505
00:36:57,100 --> 00:37:00,340
They say, my gosh, we're holding up the budget, everything will collapse, the street lights

506
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:02,420
won't be on, the police won't get paid.

507
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:07,820
It's all over, we'll lose our credit rating if we don't raise taxes and increase the national

508
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:08,820
debt.

509
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:14,100
And this is all maneuvering us into abject collapse, which is what a group of loan-sharking

510
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:18,420
foreign banks who are loaning us our own money back would do.

511
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:24,880
So it is rack and ruin, it is a direct course, and that's why I got so angry on the hike

512
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,880
and bike trail.

513
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:34,060
I had to start wearing earplugs or something last Friday because I'm sitting there, or

514
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:37,200
was it Saturday, and I've run to the top of a hill and I'm stretching.

515
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:41,660
And I hear these three guys who were obviously in state government cuz I could hear how they

516
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:43,380
were talking, and they were manager level.

517
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:48,540
They all thought they were really smart, their whole bearing, and they were just bragging

518
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:52,500
that, don't worry, Obama knows how to deal with them.

519
00:37:52,500 --> 00:38:00,100
Boehner's on the team, once the third comes, he'll be elected to leadership and then he

520
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:07,220
can do whatever he wants, Boehner can, and the economy isn't gonna go down.

521
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:12,020
They actually believe Obama's their buddy, and they're supporting it, and they're trying

522
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:19,020
to fix things, I mean, the government puts cancer viruses in shots and tries to get you

523
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:24,380
to take them, you dumb idiot, they wanna kill you.

524
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:29,140
And I just looked at the guys, and I turned on the charisma, not on purpose, a much more

525
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,180
charismatic in person.

526
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:35,180
And I just literally said, well, I mean, I already talked about it on air, I broke it

527
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:39,700
down and at the end, those guys were shaking, and they should be cuz they just heard truth.

528
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:44,380
And they went, yeah, like Greece, yeah, yeah, you're right, I was like, well, do something

529
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:45,380
about it.

530
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:50,500
I told them, I said, you know the truth, see, you just knew the truth, but you were up here

531
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:55,540
having what you thought was a politically correct discussion, like children in dress

532
00:38:55,540 --> 00:39:00,540
up pretending they're the lone ranger in Tonto.

533
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:08,060
You're a real human alive in 2013, this was 2012, there's a real war going on, wake up

534
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:11,700
and get involved in it now, stop living a fantasy land.

535
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,700
I'm sorry, sir, go ahead.

536
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:21,020
Yeah, I thought it was gonna be another, gotta read it to see what's in it, like the health

537
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:22,020
care bill.

538
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:25,940
And it wouldn't shock me at all if they try to completely go after the Second Amendment

539
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:27,980
in little sneaky ways in there.

540
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:31,820
No, God bless you, sir, I appreciate your call.

541
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:39,700
First caller of 2013, my friend, Chet in New York, Chet, you're on the air, welcome.

542
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,940
Happy New Year's, Alex and Bunch.

543
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:46,780
Hey, yeah, I'm up here in the new Rome, actually, now it was New York, but now that we have

544
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:54,740
Emperor Cuomo involved with his new degree of gun confiscation, which he's right in line

545
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:57,180
with Diane Frankenstein there.

546
00:39:57,180 --> 00:40:02,940
Yeah, he said he may issue a gubernatorial executive order and just have you hand them

547
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:03,940
in.

548
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:04,940
How's that sound?

549
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:08,540
Shocking, the thing is, I think the rest of the country, they look at New York like that

550
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:11,820
liberal part, New York City, Manhattan, you've been around there.

551
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:14,980
A lot of nice people, but it's the politics.

552
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:21,500
New York's got a lot of rural areas, hunters, etc., and people have been massing arms all

553
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,500
over the country.

554
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:27,140
No, I know, listen, upstate New York and rural areas of New York, I've been there many times,

555
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:35,340
I know the culture absolutely is about as country boy can survive as Alabama or East

556
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:39,820
Texas or same thing with Northern California.

557
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:43,500
Anywhere where people actually live in the countryside, in the real world and actually

558
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:46,980
work, they understand that you need guns to protect yourself.

559
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:53,860
And we've got all the people in the city who are domesticated, who are delusional and really

560
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:56,540
think the government's their friend.

561
00:40:56,540 --> 00:41:01,500
I agree 100%, like you said, I think you guys hit the point before where nobody's calling

562
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:07,700
for violence on our end, but it looks like they're really pushing their little, I think

563
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:11,780
their explosion button on themselves because there's a lot of people that are just not

564
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:14,580
going to give their guns up because I've spoke with them.

565
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:19,540
So I just figured I'd throw it at you, my friend, and hey, great work you're doing.

566
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:23,740
A lot of other people get in on this New Year's, but I'm staying optimistic because there's

567
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:24,740
so many of us now.

568
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:32,980
I appreciate your call, my friend, look, I'll just say this, everybody needs to be involved

569
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:47,340
in a maximum effort now to engage government and collaborator globalist occupation medium.

570
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:52,860
And let them know, hey, we know you're authoritarian criminals that want to disarm us.

571
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:57,340
You don't call up and say, hey, you know, guns actually protect people 80 plus times

572
00:41:57,340 --> 00:42:00,500
more often than they're using the commission of a crime.

573
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:06,300
Hey, areas that have more guns have lower crime, hey, England's crime rate tripled,

574
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:10,140
I kept saying doubled, it tripled, and is the highest in Europe since they took the

575
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:12,060
guns 15, 16 years ago.

576
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:17,780
Same thing with Australia and New Zealand, they know that, they're predators.

577
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:21,060
All those media people getting paid millions of dollars a year have bodyguards, they lived

578
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:23,940
in armed areas, their kids go to schools with armed guards.

579
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:28,860
They know, they sit around and talk about how you're dumb and how you're scum.

580
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:33,180
They can't even contain it on MSNBC, anyone that lives in the Southwest, anyone that lives

581
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:39,860
in the South, Midwest, that's like 80% of the country, you are scum, you are filth.

582
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:44,860
If you're a white person, they say you're dumb, you're ugly, you're scum, you're stupid.

583
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:47,620
And that if you don't accept socialism, you're a racist.

584
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:51,380
It is a total delusional elitist attitude.

585
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:59,420
I've been behind the scenes at CNN, you name it, over the years, and these are cold blooded

586
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:04,900
mercenaries, these are mercs.

587
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:11,880
And their uniform is a camouflage of non-threatening hippieism, folks, they're not hippies, they

588
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:19,140
are shock troops, stormtroopers, the army of death, okay?

589
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:24,380
And they learned, as Margaret Sanger under the advisement of Eber Bernays and the Rockefeller

590
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:32,540
Foundation, go read their quotes, to pose as non-threatening egalitarian philanthropist.

591
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:37,140
They have the moral high ground, they care, well, there's no death panels, really the

592
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:38,220
bill has it.

593
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:44,140
The books written by Daschle that wrote it says it, wrote those provisions, no, no, no,

594
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:45,140
that's not in the book.

595
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:48,060
Don't listen to him knowing no one's gonna go read it and find out we're telling the

596
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:49,060
truth.

597
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:51,620
That the Israelis don't own guns, don't listen to him.

598
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:52,620
There's no world government.

599
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:56,180
Well, I have hundreds of announcements out of the Bilderberg and Davos of world government,

600
00:43:56,180 --> 00:44:02,060
world taxes, those don't exist, children, children, they talk, and they go, we talk

601
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:03,820
with a soft NPR voice.

602
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:08,820
You ever tune into NPR and every person on there?

603
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:13,260
I was one time being interviewed by NPR and they said, can you talk softer?

604
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:14,260
Can you settle down?

605
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:20,420
During the interview, they taped it down at UT, that's down there where their local studios

606
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:24,020
are, this is like 13 years ago or something.

607
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:27,540
And they're coming over the ISDN line going, sir, can you try to talk in a softer voice?

608
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:28,540
I wasn't even yelling.

609
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:29,860
I go, well, this is what my voice sounds like.

610
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:32,600
They're like, well, can you just sound softer?

611
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:38,020
And the woman was on the line going, can you relax, relax?

612
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:43,500
You know, I grew up around rural folks, many months out of the year being sent down to

613
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:46,360
work on the ranch from the time I was about 11 on.

614
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:53,180
And I've talked to people that deal with horses and what you deal when a horse gets old is

615
00:44:53,180 --> 00:45:00,180
you do have a trailer come pick it up to take it to the Elmer's Glue factory.

616
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:04,300
And I was never there when they sold horses or got rid of them.

617
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:11,460
But you sit there and the trailer pulls up and you walk over and you, because horses

618
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:12,460
are real smart.

619
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:14,900
They're just real instinctive, that's when people think they're stupid.

620
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:17,900
No, they're real smart, but their instincts are really strong.

621
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:20,700
So it's like they have a mind, but they can't use it.

622
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:25,020
And they know, you may have loaded that horse in a trailer 10 times in that year, but you're

623
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:28,260
loading them in a trailer to go butcher them.

624
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:30,260
You're not gonna wanna get in the trailer.

625
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:36,020
And you just come over and you shh, shh, shh, here's some range cubes, here's some apple.

626
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:44,500
Come on, come on, let's get in the trailer, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, hi, this is NPR.

627
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:49,620
Just get in the trailer, hey, little girl, hey, little boy, come get in the van, I got

628
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:50,620
candy.

629
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:57,820
Hi, little, I got a puppy, I got candy, I got some free healthcare for you.

630
00:45:57,820 --> 00:46:03,260
I'm gonna give you some more welfare, I got an Obama phone, get in the car, we got some

631
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:05,380
shots for you, it's something you don't get sick.

632
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:10,820
Come on, come on, get in the car, get in the van, yeah, but my mommy says don't, it's all

633
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:11,820
right.

634
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:19,780
Mommy's in the van, mommy's in the van, your government, it's nice, come on.

635
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:24,060
We wouldn't stage Sandy Hook, no, no, get on in the van.

636
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:28,620
Get on in, get on in, sweetie.

637
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:37,580
Van door slams, eat the candy, well, I want my mommy, it's okay, eat the candy.

638
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:41,780
And then the tape comes out around the head, and then they tie you up, tie the three year

639
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:46,720
old up, yes, that's how it works.

640
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:51,620
Let's go ahead and talk to Alice in Kansas, Alice, you're on the air, should I talk in

641
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:57,500
an NPR voice, hi, Alice, good to have you on with us on All Things Considered, welcome.

642
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:02,860
Hi, Alex, I've been listening to you for 15 years and I feel your exhaustion and your

643
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:08,540
pain, I understand where you're coming from, and I just felt a leading of the Holy Spirit

644
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:11,620
to give you something that might comfort you, it should take less than two minutes.

645
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:16,940
There are five points, I just want you to maybe listen and consider in your prayer time.

646
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:22,900
I wanted to tell you that you are a warrior of the Lord, He has chosen you, and in the

647
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:27,460
end, you answer only to the Lord, it doesn't matter what any man thinks of you.

648
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:33,700
Number two, you are the teacher, listeners are the students, it is a privilege for the

649
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:40,020
student to come to your class, you give it out, and the wind blows where it will.

650
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:45,820
They either get it or they don't, you have fulfilled your vow and responsibility to God,

651
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:48,220
and that's who you answer to, period.

652
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:53,860
Number three, you don't just justify yourself to any man anymore, if they don't like your

653
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:59,540
class, they can leave it and turn it off, they can address the issues, but they cannot

654
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:07,420
attack your character as soon as they attempt to assault you, that ends the call, no exceptions,

655
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:11,460
and do not address it further, just go to the next call like you would if someone was

656
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:13,940
using foul language, I'm nervous.

657
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:18,780
Let me just add this, ma'am, your kind words, I think we're all teaching each other, life

658
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:28,020
is a great college, and I have asked God, my prayer is, God, I'm weak, I'm evil, I'm

659
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:32,940
a sinner, please help me be a good person, and in these desperate times, please use me

660
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:38,660
to be a vessel to stand against people that wanna hurt innocents, I'm weak, will you please

661
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:41,500
give me the strength to do what has to be done?

662
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:49,540
That's my prayer, and that's what I stand for, and that's basically all I can do, and

663
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:53,500
I think that's all anybody else can do, but my great calling, God's letter on my heart,

664
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:58,260
is to get other people to stand up and be leaders as well, and I know there are people

665
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:05,180
out there listening who feel the calling to stand against evil, but you're so humble,

666
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:09,500
you're like, well, I'm not a leader, and I think what you're saying to me is I am a leader,

667
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:14,100
I need to stop being not so much humble, humble's good, but not let that get in the way of standing

668
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:19,260
up and really resisting, and I say that to others, we have a job to do, and it doesn't

669
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:25,300
mean we're gonna do it perfect, we just gotta ask God, help us do the right thing, and then

670
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:29,540
let God sort it out, we've gotta give it to God, but that doesn't mean just give it to

671
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:34,780
God and then do nothing, it means God, lead me, and I'm telling you, folks, if you ask

672
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:39,100
God for discernment, and if you ask God to open the universe up to you, it will happen.

673
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:45,420
Now, I wanna warn people, though, when the universe really opens up, it is mind-blowing,

674
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:47,740
and it only intensifies, do you see my point?

675
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:52,220
Yes, I see your point, I have two more things to say.

676
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:53,220
Go ahead.

677
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:59,180
Okay, the fourth one is be aware of the wiles of the devil, Satan comes but to rob, kill,

678
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:03,780
and destroy, and every time you allow a caller to assault your character, you waste the next

679
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:08,980
20 minutes of valuable air time that God gave you, explaining your righteousness, it gets

680
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:14,100
you all upset, it makes you physically ill, and it hurts your body, it exhausts you, what

681
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:20,380
a great weapon he uses against you, and he uses it frequently, so draw your sword, put

682
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:26,420
up your shield, and allow it no further, and then your peace will come back to you.

683
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:31,580
Number five, don't allow the pressures, I mean, don't allow the praises of men, men

684
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:37,640
betray but God will never betray, it too is a weapon of warfare and used against you,

685
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:41,260
if you will let it, it can alter your ego, ego may the praise of God be with you.

686
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:45,980
I agree, Allison, I'm out of time, great call, God bless you, and this new year's resolution

687
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:55,660
to take more calls and to work harder is the way to go, what's the saying, duty is a mountain,

688
00:50:55,660 --> 00:51:00,900
death is a feather, we'll be back with more of your calls, stay with us.

689
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:05,540
This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.

690
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:09,900
Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.

691
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:14,540
Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows

692
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:20,160
you to have, it's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology

693
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,240
is coming.

694
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:25,540
Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded,

695
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:29,580
and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.

696
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:33,900
Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids, every year thousands

697
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:36,580
of families lose their power from weather-related outages.

698
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:41,340
Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.

699
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:45,300
Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,

700
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:46,660

You're on a golden stag safari for big game.

But it's not Africa.

722
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:23,860
It's Argentina.

723
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:30,660
One-on-one guided hunts for water buffalo, huger, bighorn rams, wild boar, and the biggest

Yeah, I've been watching.

734
00:53:58,660 --> 00:53:59,660
I've been waiting.

735
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:00,660
Welcome back.

736
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:01,660
Monday through Friday, 12 noon to 3 p.m. Eastern.

737
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:25,060
What is that, 9 to noon Pacific?

738
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:26,980
We are here live, ladies and gentlemen.

739
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:28,620
I am Alex Jones, your host.

740
00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:33,180
This segment and the next, then Representative Susanna Hupp is scheduled to pop in with us.

741
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:38,540
She's the one of the survivors of the Luby Massacre, who spoke out in Congress eloquently.

742
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:39,540
Always good to have her pop in.

743
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:41,300
She's been on a few times over the years.

744
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:45,100
And then at the bottom of the next hour, we'll continue with calls and news.

745
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:51,460
After I get into a breakdown, where I need to be calm and try to go over what is 21 really

746
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:56,420
is, not just they're gonna make you live in a 250 square foot thing and double your taxes.

747
00:54:56,420 --> 00:54:57,420
It's more than that.

748
00:54:57,420 --> 00:55:00,140
It's designed to destroy civilization.

749
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:08,140
It was Oliver Wendell Holmes that, to paraphrase, basically said that taxes are the cost of

750
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:09,140
civilization.

751
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:15,980
Well, what about when your taxes are used to create a Malthusian destructive civilization?

752
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:20,900
So we're gonna be breaking that down here today.

753
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:25,140
The exact quote is taxes are the price we pay for civilization.

754
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:29,180
Briefly here, ladies and gentlemen, the new Infowars magazine is out.

755
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:32,980
It's available to buy in bulk at cost in groups of 10 up to 100.

756
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:38,020
Big color, the size of the old Rolling Stone, full of graphics, documents, articles.

757
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:40,340
2013, the year America dies, you can buy them in bulk.

758
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:42,220
So I give them something like a color book, basically.

759
00:55:42,220 --> 00:55:45,660
And as print goes out, we go into print.

760
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:46,660
Because we should be balanced.

761
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:47,880
We shouldn't just be Internet only.

762
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:50,020
We should have hard copies of things.

763
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:53,620
And so I've committed that we're going to always put out hard copies of whatever we

764
00:55:53,620 --> 00:55:57,140
produce, whether it's films or you name it.

765
00:55:57,140 --> 00:55:58,460
Very important.

766
00:55:58,460 --> 00:56:02,860
And so you can get the January issue, 2013, the year America dies, question mark.

767
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:04,780
Very powerful issue.

778
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:43,500
Al in Delaware.

779
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:44,500
Al, you're on the air.

780
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:45,500
Thanks for holding.

781
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:50,500
Hey, Alex, congratulations on making it to 2013.

782
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:51,500
You're a trooper, my man.

783
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:53,220
You're the son I never had.

784
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:57,940
You are the light at the end of the tunnel, haven't talked to you in a couple of years.

785
00:56:57,940 --> 00:57:02,820
I got to tell you, you're the reason I was able to take my home from the bank.

786
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:08,380
You're the reason that I've been able to survive this long, preparing and getting ready.

787
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:12,940
These people are bad-eared warlocks, rabid dogs off the leash.

788
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:17,220
No such thing as a politician, as a politician, they're plotiticians.

789
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:21,100
Alex, you've taken me places I could have never gone elsewhere.

790
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:27,220
I've lost all my friends, but I've got you and three little dogs and I couldn't be happier.

791
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:28,220
Thank you.

792
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:31,900
Well, your friends are in the matrix and wearing an Infowars t-shirt, you'll find like-minded

793
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:33,660
people in your area.

794
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:37,540
But yeah, folks that bought gold when we said buy it at 300 have done well.

795
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:39,860
We've taught folks how the banks run scams.

796
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:44,940
I've had countless people show up at events where we just told them about mineral supplementation,

797
00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:49,620
where they're literally healthy now from death's doorstep.

798
00:57:49,620 --> 00:57:51,220
And none of it is a secret.

799
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:54,420
The globalists know all this.

800
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:56,680
That's what's so frustrating about it all.

801
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:57,680
But you know what?

802
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:59,260
Liberty is the light at the end of the tunnel.

803
00:57:59,260 --> 00:58:02,300
We are just a window into liberty and freedom, my friend.

804
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:04,100
Anything else you'd like to add here?

805
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:07,980
Yeah, the truth is driving people crazy.

806
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:09,300
They just can't take it.

807
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:10,300
Well, I'll tell you something.

808
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:15,740
They called me a drug dealer at settlement and I said, oh, no, you don't after 30 years

809
00:58:15,740 --> 00:58:16,740
of a builder.

810
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:21,500
I got a woman and a half an hour they gave me my house right after starting the Patriot

811
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:22,500
Act.

812
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:24,500
And I served in the military.

813
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:30,820
These are corrupt, dangerous, hell on wheels, nightmarish people there.

814
00:58:30,820 --> 00:58:32,460
I tell you what, stay there.

815
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:33,460
I want to come back to you.

816
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:34,460
You're on fire.

817
00:58:34,460 --> 00:58:35,460
You're right.

818
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:39,460
They are rabid dog warlocks in giant hordes like locusts.

819
00:58:39,460 --> 00:58:50,660
This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.

820
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:54,260
Alex Jones here with a very important announcement for truth seekers.

821
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:58,700
We've carried a lot of amazing films and books over the years on the online video bookstore

822
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:04,020
at Infowars.com and out of all the titles we've carried, one stands out because it is

823
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:06,780
just so chillingly convincing.

824
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:12,500
And that's Dreams from My Real Father by Joel Gilbert, available at Infowars.com.

825
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:16,060
This film exposes the fraud that Obama is like nothing I've seen.

826
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:20,240
If you want to know who Obama's real daddy is, this is the film for you.

827
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:24,740
Don't forget your purchase supports our broadcast and our growing media network.

828
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:27,100
You'll also find it in infowarshop.com.

829
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:30,860
None Dare Call a Conspiracy by Gary Allen, the book that woke me up.

830
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:35,540
We're also carrying Behind the Green Mask, you in Agenda 21 by Rosa Corey.

831
00:59:35,540 --> 00:59:38,420
This book is coffin nails to the globalist takeover.

832
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:43,300
The Greater Good, the most professional and up-to-date film I've ever seen, exposing the

833
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:45,340
scourge that is vaccines.

834
00:59:45,340 --> 00:59:53,780
These titles and a lot more are all available at infowarshop.com.

835
00:59:53,780 --> 01:00:05,460
Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.

836
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:10,220
Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.

837
01:00:10,220 --> 01:00:11,220
You want answers?

838
01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:13,580
Well, so does he.

839
01:00:13,580 --> 01:00:17,580
He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.

840
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:22,180
And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.

841
01:00:22,180 --> 01:00:28,740
Ladies and gentlemen, we are now into hour number two.

842
01:00:28,740 --> 01:00:36,780
We have former state rep and Blue Beast Massacre survivor, Susanna Hough, joining us.

843
01:00:36,780 --> 01:00:39,940
And then we're gonna continue with your phone calls, but right now we're talking to Allen,

844
01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:40,940
Delaware.

845
01:00:40,940 --> 01:00:42,940
He was talking about how they use the Patriot Act.

846
01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:47,620
Yeah, they'll just come in and foreclose on a house that's even paid for, where they don't

847
01:00:47,620 --> 01:00:49,520
even have a note in some cases.

848
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:51,300
And they'll just say, you're a drug dealer.

849
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:55,500
I mean, the cops pull you over now and just say, we're gonna search you.

850
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:56,500
We think you're a drug dealer.

851
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:59,820
The government ships it all in, they play all sorts of crazy games.

852
01:00:59,820 --> 01:01:04,100
This whole Patriot Act, the whole Homeland Security system, it was always set up and

853
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:07,980
designed and aimed at the American people.

854
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:09,420
That's always been the case.

855
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:13,740
And now they're just gonna let you know in the next four years, it's official.

856
01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:15,900
They're announcing death panels to kill old people.

857
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:18,580
They're saying the Constitution is evil and must be overthrown.

858
01:01:18,580 --> 01:01:20,180
I've got articles, that's coming up.

859
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:23,300
Add any other points, Al, you needed to make.

860
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:28,460
Well, the points I want to make is that every time we turn around, the government is hijacking

861
01:01:28,460 --> 01:01:29,460
industry.

862
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:32,500
They're hijacking every last one of us now.

863
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:35,980
They have literally shanghaied the Constitution.

864
01:01:35,980 --> 01:01:42,060
They're coming at us in such an evil, evil and just utterly egregious, I call them fleas,

865
01:01:42,060 --> 01:01:43,060
Alex.

866
01:01:43,060 --> 01:01:46,860
These are felonious litigators, egregiously attacking society.

867
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:50,580
And let me tell you something, you work your whole life to build up your wealth and you

868
01:01:50,580 --> 01:01:53,300
think for one minute they're not coming to get it?

869
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:58,180
You think for one minute they're not gonna addict you to some bogus financial product

870
01:01:58,180 --> 01:02:01,700
and then you're gonna build your wealth, you're gonna renovate your homes, you're gonna put

871
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:04,660
your children through college for what?

872
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:10,460
Let me tell you what it's for, it's the shackles of debt and lies and this is where we're at.

873
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:16,020
They've not just done this country, Alex, they've done the whole world, the entire world.

874
01:02:16,020 --> 01:02:18,660
No, they follow the blueprint.

875
01:02:18,660 --> 01:02:23,660
That's what I'm telling the domesticated people that are in this delusion that the overall

876
01:02:23,660 --> 01:02:26,120
controllers of the system are their friends.

877
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:31,600
They are totally ruthless and just like Susanna Hupp said, 15, 16 years ago to Congress that

878
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:35,380
she owns firearms to protect herself from government.

879
01:02:35,380 --> 01:02:39,060
That's what the founding fathers said, and that's what it's all about.

880
01:02:39,060 --> 01:02:43,060
And everywhere they've taken the guns, the crime rate explodes, they love it.

881
01:02:43,060 --> 01:02:48,240
This is a criminal energy, a criminal force that, I mean, look at Congress involved in

882
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:49,240
insider trading.

883
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:53,580
When they got caught, they said, well, we'll pass a law to outlaw it, which actually legalized

884
01:02:53,580 --> 01:02:55,300
it where they can just get a waiver.

885
01:02:55,300 --> 01:02:58,700
I mean, it is insane what we're dealing with.

886
01:02:58,700 --> 01:03:02,300
The laws they create are lies, we know our documents.

887
01:03:02,300 --> 01:03:06,480
Look, we're naked, we don't have a Justice Department, Alex.

888
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:13,260
We don't have, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue is nothing but a crow's nest.

889
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:18,780
These people are so far gone plotting their next move on you.

890
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:23,860
And everybody's walking around like, everything's gonna be fine, the economy will turn around.

891
01:03:23,860 --> 01:03:26,060
And socialism's not so bad.

892
01:03:26,060 --> 01:03:29,020
I just about can't take another minute.

893
01:03:29,020 --> 01:03:33,460
No, no, they sell them, they throw America in the water and then throw the life raft

894
01:03:33,460 --> 01:03:37,020
out of socialism when it's actually a bowling ball to take you to the bottom.

895
01:03:37,020 --> 01:03:40,700
When you get to the bottom, they go, here's another bowling ball.

896
01:03:40,700 --> 01:03:47,340
And again, the truth is that people are in two camps, they're either waking up or they're

897
01:03:47,340 --> 01:03:48,340
asleep.

898
01:03:48,340 --> 01:03:54,100
And God help us because they are demonizing gun owners, calling them Nazis, Klan members,

899
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:56,100
baby killers, scum of the earth.

900
01:03:56,100 --> 01:04:00,560
They demonize a group before they come after you and they want a purge of gun owners.

901
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:04,260
We have former representative Susanna Hupp on the line with us.

902
01:04:04,260 --> 01:04:08,260
We're gonna come back from break and talk to her and play that short clip of her from

903
01:04:08,260 --> 01:04:12,860
her longer testimony that's so famous before Congress telling Chuck Schumer and others,

904
01:04:12,860 --> 01:04:16,100
hey, we don't have these guns, I'm sick of hearing about how it's for duck hunting.

905
01:04:16,100 --> 01:04:22,300
It's to protect us from you guys up there, aka Waco and events like that and the full

906
01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:25,060
testimony we've posted up at infowars.com.

907
01:04:25,060 --> 01:04:32,700
But I wanted to get her take on the other side about this unprecedented Diane Feinstein,

908
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:37,140
our video, still posted at drugsreport.com on the right hand side.

909
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:41,780
This video of Diane Feinstein saying, Mr. and Mrs. America, turn in your guns.

910
01:04:41,780 --> 01:04:43,300
That's a quote.

911
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:44,300
Let's get that clip ready.

912
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:45,700
I want to play that for her.

913
01:04:45,700 --> 01:04:50,380
She's also a talk show host on 590, one of my affiliates, one of our 140 plus.

914
01:04:50,380 --> 01:04:53,060
We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, stay with us.

915
01:04:53,060 --> 01:05:01,620
We'll be back.

916
01:05:01,620 --> 01:05:06,300
Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our

917
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:08,340
immunity and health.

918
01:05:08,340 --> 01:05:12,940
At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing a full selection of

919
01:05:12,940 --> 01:05:15,100
silver based products.

920

Our most popular silver based products are the 32 ounce nano silver solutions, our two

921
01:05:20,460 --> 01:05:26,180
ounce nano silver nasal applicators, as well as our all natural silver soaps.

922
01:05:26,180 --> 01:05:30,220
Just released is our 100% natural silver gel.

923
01:05:30,220 --> 01:05:34,860
Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and

924
01:05:34,860 --> 01:05:40,020
leave the silver at the surface, but rather we have formulated our silver gel using the

925
01:05:40,020 --> 01:05:44,580
natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the

926
01:05:44,580 --> 01:05:48,580
skin while delivering the silver more effectively.

927
01:05:48,580 --> 01:05:55,100

That's www.silverlungs.com.

930
01:06:00,620 --> 01:06:04,900
Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as

931
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:06,300
you get sick and die?

932
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:08,480
Start purifying your water with ProPure.

933
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:13,060
My friends, I've done a lot of research and the best gravity filter out there bar none

934
01:06:13,060 --> 01:06:17,640
is ProPure and it's available discounted at infowars.com.

935
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:21,100
Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.

936
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:22,780
There's no priming required.

937
01:06:22,780 --> 01:06:24,860
It's NSF 42 certified.

938
01:06:24,860 --> 01:06:28,460
Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.

939
01:06:28,460 --> 01:06:30,020
Easy to set up and use.

940
01:06:30,020 --> 01:06:31,500
It doesn't require electricity.

941
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:34,820
Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.

942
01:06:34,820 --> 01:06:37,980
This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.

943
01:06:37,980 --> 01:06:42,300
Save money by not buying bottled water and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.

944
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:45,020
ProPure is the best gravity fed filter out there.

945
01:06:45,020 --> 01:06:47,020
It's what my family uses.

946
01:06:47,020 --> 01:06:51,300

01:07:01,780 --> 01:07:06,380
We have witnessed two terrible storms in the East, but we are still in the eye of the perfect

950
01:07:06,380 --> 01:07:07,380
storm.

951
01:07:07,380 --> 01:07:11,620
The most devastating economic conditions since the Great Depression, America's worst drought

952
01:07:11,620 --> 01:07:16,500
in agricultural history, and now the economic results of the presidential election.

953
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:19,780
This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.

954
01:07:19,780 --> 01:07:24,060
I just doubled down and got even more supplies from E Foods Direct and I recommend you do

955
01:07:24,060 --> 01:07:25,060
the same.

956
01:07:25,060 --> 01:07:27,740
It's time to get your own supply from E Foods Direct.

957
01:07:27,740 --> 01:07:31,340
I know I won't be standing in a bread line trading my freedom for food.

958
01:07:31,340 --> 01:07:35,740
I'm taking control of my future and you're nuts if you don't do the same.

959
01:07:35,740 --> 01:07:39,780
Go to efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex to find the specials and you can start with

960
01:07:39,780 --> 01:07:43,540
a holiday gift pack that's normally $80, now under 50 bucks.

961
01:07:43,540 --> 01:07:46,140
Remember, I can warn you, but I can't feed you.

962
01:07:46,140 --> 01:07:51,100
Call 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.

963
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:54,700
Would you rather prepare six months too early or one day too late?

964
01:07:54,700 --> 01:08:05,620
400-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.

965
01:08:05,620 --> 01:08:10,420
Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.

966
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:11,420
You want answers?

967
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:13,540
Well, so does he.

968
01:08:13,540 --> 01:08:26,220
He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.

969
01:08:26,220 --> 01:08:30,340
Representative Susanna Grasha Hupp, former representative.

970
01:08:30,340 --> 01:08:33,820
She's a survivor of the Luby's massacre, some of her family was killed.

971
01:08:33,820 --> 01:08:39,420
She famously testified before Congress to Chuck Schumer that, hey, our guns aren't for

972
01:08:39,420 --> 01:08:40,540
duck hunting.

973
01:08:40,540 --> 01:08:44,400
The full testimony's up at infoawards.com right now.

974
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:46,100
We just reposted it up there.

975
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:49,660
She said it's to protect us from you guys up there.

976
01:08:49,660 --> 01:08:54,180
And I wanted to get her on the air because she was instrumental nationwide testifying

977
01:08:54,180 --> 01:08:56,420
before legislatures everywhere.

978
01:08:56,420 --> 01:09:01,380
Not just the Texas legislature that she later chaired committees on to get concealed carry-in.

979
01:09:01,380 --> 01:09:06,300
And we've seen 25, 30% or more reductions in every state that's done it.

980
01:09:06,300 --> 01:09:09,780
So she'll be joining us to the bottom of the hour here in just a moment.

981
01:09:09,780 --> 01:09:14,140
Here is just a short excerpt of her testimony before Congress.

982
01:09:14,140 --> 01:09:17,980
The Second Amendment is not about duck hunting.

983
01:09:17,980 --> 01:09:22,860
And I know I'm not gonna make very many friends saying this.

984
01:09:22,860 --> 01:09:28,380
But it's about all right, all of our right to be able to protect ourselves from all of

985
01:09:28,380 --> 01:09:31,460
you guys up there.

986
01:09:31,460 --> 01:09:35,420
Man, and boy, that was what back in the mid 1990s.

987
01:09:35,420 --> 01:09:37,820
And here we are in 2013.

988
01:09:37,820 --> 01:09:43,000
Great way to kick off the new year with a champion of liberty, who I've gotta say if

989
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:47,700
any one person got concealed carry-in, you can say what you want about it turning a right

990
01:09:47,700 --> 01:09:48,820
into a privilege.

991
01:09:48,820 --> 01:09:54,300
The point is, is that it put guns on the street in law abiding citizens' hands and the criminals

992
01:09:54,300 --> 01:09:56,420
are keeping their heads down.

993
01:09:56,420 --> 01:09:59,500
Violent crime down over 20% nationwide on average since then.

994
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:03,460
We've shown the new FBI statistics, except in areas where they've taken the guns, crime

995
01:10:03,460 --> 01:10:04,460
is up.

996
01:10:04,460 --> 01:10:10,740
Former representative, talk show host on 590 AM, you name it, best-selling author.

997
01:10:10,740 --> 01:10:12,300
Mrs. Hupp, good to have you on with us.

998
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:14,700
Hey, happy new year to you, Alex.

999
01:10:14,700 --> 01:10:17,580
Wow, I am excited.

1000
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:22,380
What's your take on everything that's happening and the open calls now and the Feinstein bill

1001
01:10:22,380 --> 01:10:24,980
to physically make you turn guns in?

1002
01:10:24,980 --> 01:10:27,660
It's a scary thing, isn't it?

1003
01:10:27,660 --> 01:10:33,340
I've talked to a lot of friends of mine who, we all trying to talk big.

1004
01:10:33,340 --> 01:10:39,460
You hear the, from my cold dead fingers comments, but the truth of the matter is, if a bunch

1005
01:10:39,460 --> 01:10:45,860
of jack-looted thugs show up at my door and put a gun to my child's head and says, turn

1006
01:10:45,860 --> 01:10:52,260
over all your guns or else, I'm probably going to turn over my guns.

1007
01:10:52,260 --> 01:10:59,460
So I think it's really important and I think this is why so often revolutions are mostly

1008
01:10:59,460 --> 01:11:02,980
about young people and young people without extended families.

1009
01:11:02,980 --> 01:11:05,580
You know what I mean?

1010
01:11:05,580 --> 01:11:09,340
It's a scary world right now.

1011
01:11:09,340 --> 01:11:13,260
It certainly is, but there's 160 plus million gun owners.

1012
01:11:13,260 --> 01:11:17,020
If 1% fight back, that's 1.5 million soldiers.

1013
01:11:17,020 --> 01:11:21,460
I agree, most people are going to turn them in, at least in the first wave, but the tyranny

1014
01:11:21,460 --> 01:11:24,580
that follows is going to result in a civil war.

1015
01:11:24,580 --> 01:11:28,900
And if you notice all the branding of Obama as the new Lincoln and how he's going to kick

1016
01:11:28,900 --> 01:11:30,820
the butt of the states, it's pretty creepy.

1017
01:11:30,820 --> 01:11:33,420
It is, it's very frightening.

1018
01:11:33,420 --> 01:11:37,660
And when I talk about people turning in their guns, I think there are an awful lot of people

1019
01:11:37,660 --> 01:11:43,780
that are going out of their way to purchase guns that don't have a track record, that

1020
01:11:43,780 --> 01:11:45,500
can't be traced to them.

1021
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:48,940
And those guns are going to be hidden and buried all over the place.

1022
01:11:48,940 --> 01:11:54,260
And we might be some of those people, Alex.

1023
01:11:54,260 --> 01:11:58,460
You and I are going to be the first doors that they knock on.

1024
01:11:58,460 --> 01:11:59,460
You're right.

1025
01:11:59,460 --> 01:12:01,260
We're going to make examples of people.

1026
01:12:01,260 --> 01:12:06,340
Why do you think, for listeners that just joined us, we have the club, Diane Feinstein

1027
01:12:06,340 --> 01:12:12,140
and others are saying, Mr. and Mrs. America, get ready to turn your guns in.

1028
01:12:12,140 --> 01:12:13,140
Why do I think she's doing that?

1029
01:12:13,140 --> 01:12:19,380
I think because she's absolutely clear that she has the backing of the president.

1030
01:12:19,380 --> 01:12:26,180
And she now has, I would say, 70% of the media firmly behind her.

1031
01:12:26,180 --> 01:12:30,700
I was actually sitting, getting a manicure a few days ago, and there was a lady kind

1032
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:32,820
of across from me, somebody I didn't know at all.

1033
01:12:32,820 --> 01:12:36,420
And she got to talking about the guns and the shooting in Connecticut.

1034
01:12:36,420 --> 01:12:40,500
And she turned to me and said, well, I just think we should get rid of all the guns.

1035
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:41,500
What do you think?

1036
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:43,940
Of course, that was a mistake, right?

1037
01:12:43,940 --> 01:12:48,420
No, I took it very easy on her and I didn't tell her any of my background or anything.

1038
01:12:48,420 --> 01:12:51,860
And I simply said, well, you know, I've thought about it.

1039
01:12:51,860 --> 01:12:57,460
But it seems to me that not one single one of these mass shootings has ever occurred

1040
01:12:57,460 --> 01:13:00,060
where guns were allowed.

1041
01:13:00,060 --> 01:13:02,380
And she stopped and she kind of blinked.

1042
01:13:02,380 --> 01:13:05,780
And she got up and she went and washed her hands and then came back and sat down and

1043
01:13:05,780 --> 01:13:10,580
looked at me and she said, you know, I never thought about that, but you're right.

1044
01:13:10,580 --> 01:13:16,300
So I think there are an awful lot of people out there that you can't grab with statistics.

1045
01:13:16,300 --> 01:13:19,660
You can't grab with logic.

1046
01:13:19,660 --> 01:13:24,340
I think there are a lot of people out there that you have to put them in the position

1047
01:13:24,340 --> 01:13:30,340
of being, you know, as close as you can, put them mentally in the position of being completely

1048
01:13:30,340 --> 01:13:35,460
helpless and then ask them if they would rather have somebody with them, even if they choose

1049
01:13:35,460 --> 01:13:39,100
not to have a gun, if they would rather have somebody with them that knows how to use one

1050
01:13:39,100 --> 01:13:40,100
or not.

1051
01:13:40,100 --> 01:13:48,060
You know, even if they won't defend themselves, most people are willing to defend their child.

1052
01:13:48,060 --> 01:13:51,980
So I do my best to talk about that sort of thing.

1053
01:13:51,980 --> 01:13:55,480
I know it's hard for you to talk about it, but you do to save other lives.

1054
01:13:55,480 --> 01:13:58,860
And I've got to commend you again, as you know, people can pull up the uniform crime

1055
01:13:58,860 --> 01:13:59,860
statistics.

1056
01:13:59,860 --> 01:14:04,500
Since concealed carry became ubiquitous in most states, crime rates on average around

1057
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:05,500
24 to 25%.

1058
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:09,960
National, it's only about 20 because of some of the gun-free zones like Chicago and New

1059
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:10,960
York.

1060
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:16,100
But the Luby's massacre was a mass murder that took place October 16, 1991 in Killeen,

1061
01:14:16,100 --> 01:14:18,300
Texas, United States.

1062
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:24,180
When George Hennard crashed his pickup truck through the front window, got to ban pickup

1063
01:14:24,180 --> 01:14:30,180
trucks, on a Luby's cafeteria and shot 50 people, killing 23, exchanged shots with responding

1064
01:14:30,180 --> 01:14:33,820
officers and then hid in a bathroom and fatally shot himself.

1065
01:14:33,820 --> 01:14:36,100
You were there, you lost your parents.

1066
01:14:36,100 --> 01:14:40,460
I know it's tough to talk about, but we've now seen fathers that lost children in the

1067
01:14:40,460 --> 01:14:45,060
last few shootings come out and say, don't use this to take people's guns.

1068
01:14:45,060 --> 01:14:47,340
But the media tries to ignore them.

1069
01:14:47,340 --> 01:14:51,740
You as a survivor, I mean, you more than anybody have a right to lay out the record.

1070
01:14:51,740 --> 01:14:55,980
Can you, for people that don't know, describe what happened and what would have happened

1071
01:14:55,980 --> 01:14:57,980
if you would have had a firearm?

1072
01:14:57,980 --> 01:15:05,380
Well, to try to keep it brief for you folks, my parents and I, I was about 31 I think at

1073
01:15:05,380 --> 01:15:08,500
the time, where I just dated myself.

1074
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:13,580
My parents and I had gone to a local cafeteria and we were actually eating with the manager

1075
01:15:13,580 --> 01:15:19,340
of the cafeteria, the place was packed, it was bosses day, it was the day after payday,

1076
01:15:19,340 --> 01:15:25,380
middle of the day, beautiful day, and this guy drove his truck through the window, it

1077
01:15:25,380 --> 01:15:30,820
was a floor-to-ceiling window, and crashed into a number of tables and came to a jerking

1078
01:15:30,820 --> 01:15:34,220
halt, pretty much in the middle of the restaurant.

1079
01:15:34,220 --> 01:15:36,420
And of course you think it's an accident.

1080
01:15:36,420 --> 01:15:42,300
And we began to rise up to go help people they had knocked over and we heard gunshots.

1081
01:15:42,300 --> 01:15:48,300
I was on the passenger side of the vehicle and it was maybe 15 feet away from me.

1082
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:52,300
My father and I immediately got down on the floor and put the table, turned the table

1083
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:57,700
up on its side in front of us, my mom was down behind us, and the shooting continued.

1084
01:15:57,700 --> 01:16:03,020
I realized this was 1991 and these mass shootings weren't occurring back then, so it wasn't

1085
01:16:03,020 --> 01:16:05,380
the first thing that comes to your mind.

1086
01:16:05,380 --> 01:16:08,580
We were waiting for him to say something like, alright, everybody put your wallets up on

1087
01:16:08,580 --> 01:16:13,180
the table, or something like that.

1088
01:16:13,180 --> 01:16:18,540
But that didn't happen, he just kept shooting, and when he worked his way around the front

1089
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:25,300
of the truck and he was working toward us, a full, I'm gonna say 45 seconds had passed,

1090
01:16:25,300 --> 01:16:30,020
and I realized he was just executing people.

1091
01:16:30,020 --> 01:16:35,940
And it just, 45 seconds, Alex, 45 seconds is an eternity.

1092
01:16:35,940 --> 01:16:39,780
And I did realize that I reached for my purse that had fallen on the floor next to me.

1093
01:16:39,780 --> 01:16:42,740
I thought, I've got it, I've got this guy.

1094
01:16:42,740 --> 01:16:49,820
I used to carry a gun in my purse illegally because an assistant VA out of Houston that

1095
01:16:49,820 --> 01:16:54,340
was a patient of mine convinced me to carry it illegally.

1096
01:16:54,340 --> 01:16:57,700
But I did like most people, you know, you think, eh, what are the odds, if I need a

1097
01:16:57,700 --> 01:17:00,900
gun it's gonna be if I break down on a back road somewhere.

1098
01:17:00,900 --> 01:17:07,020
It sure as heck not gonna be in a crowded restaurant in the middle of the day.

1099
01:17:07,020 --> 01:17:13,180
But my gun was 100 yards away in my car where I had begun dutifully leaving it.

1100
01:17:13,180 --> 01:17:19,420
So long story short, at that point, my dad started to break free from my grip and said,

1101
01:17:19,420 --> 01:17:23,180
I've gotta do something, I've gotta do something, he's gonna kill everybody in here.

1102
01:17:23,180 --> 01:17:30,860
And he made a run at the guy, and the guy just turned and shot my father in the chest,

1103
01:17:30,860 --> 01:17:34,580
again, I apologize, I'm trying to make it a short story.

1104
01:17:34,580 --> 01:17:39,420
No, it's important, thank you for sharing it.

1105
01:17:39,420 --> 01:17:43,660
The good news with that, my dad was mortally wounded, I mean, he had covered maybe half

1106
01:17:43,660 --> 01:17:47,340
the distance, he was seven, eight feet from me, but he was still alive.

1107
01:17:47,340 --> 01:17:50,620
The good thing about that was it made the gunman change directions and he had to go

1108
01:17:50,620 --> 01:17:55,940
off to my left instead of continuing directly toward me.

1109
01:17:55,940 --> 01:17:59,380
Somebody way at the back of the restaurant broke out on one of the windows back there

1110
01:17:59,380 --> 01:18:02,220
and began to escape through that window.

1111
01:18:02,220 --> 01:18:04,940
People were able to escape that way.

1112
01:18:04,940 --> 01:18:08,460
We were kind of up in the front corner and couldn't get out.

1113
01:18:08,460 --> 01:18:12,260
When I saw what I thought was the chance, the gunman had his back turned toward me,

1114
01:18:12,260 --> 01:18:15,860
I stood up, I grabbed my mother by the shirt collar, I said, come on, come on, we gotta

1115
01:18:15,860 --> 01:18:19,860
run, we gotta get out of here, and my feet grew wings.

1116
01:18:19,860 --> 01:18:28,100
And to circle it back around, my mom did not follow me out, and I didn't know that until

1117
01:18:28,100 --> 01:18:31,380
after, literally, I was outside of the restaurant.

1118
01:18:31,380 --> 01:18:33,260
She was staying with your dad, wasn't she?

1119
01:18:33,260 --> 01:18:38,020
The police officers later told me what happened to her, they said that, and a number of them

1120
01:18:38,020 --> 01:18:43,180
were patients of mine, and they took me and my family to lunch about a week later and

1121
01:18:43,180 --> 01:18:44,180
told us.

1122
01:18:44,180 --> 01:18:52,000
They said that when they got into the front, they saw a woman on her knees cradling a mortally

1123
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:55,660
wounded man, and they didn't know who the gunman was.

1124
01:18:55,660 --> 01:18:59,980
And they saw this 30-something-year-old man walk up to her, they said, he put a gun to

1125
01:18:59,980 --> 01:19:04,580
her head, she looked up at him, put her head down, and he pulled the trigger.

1126
01:19:04,580 --> 01:19:09,620
And they said all they had to do was fire a shot into the ceiling, and this guy rabbited

1127
01:19:09,620 --> 01:19:14,340
to a back bathroom alcove area, as he said, exchanged a little gunfire with him, and then

1128
01:19:14,340 --> 01:19:16,620
put a bullet in his own head.

1129
01:19:16,620 --> 01:19:21,180
My parents had just had their 47th wedding anniversary a couple of weeks prior to this,

1130
01:19:21,180 --> 01:19:25,380
and it just didn't occur to me while I was running, mom, mom wasn't going anywhere

1131
01:19:25,380 --> 01:19:27,780
without dad.

1132
01:19:27,780 --> 01:19:35,060
So I was really angry, Alex, I was really, I was really angry, I felt very guilty.

1133
01:19:35,060 --> 01:19:39,980
I was very angry, and I know people think I made this up later, but you can check that

1134
01:19:39,980 --> 01:19:44,580
the newspapers from the second day, I said I was angry at my legislators, because they

1135
01:19:44,580 --> 01:19:49,580
had legislated me out of the right to protect myself and my family.

1136
01:19:49,580 --> 01:19:52,380
And you can say, well, Susanna, you could have missed.

1137
01:19:52,380 --> 01:19:53,380
Yeah, I could have.

1138
01:19:53,380 --> 01:19:55,380
Your gun could have jammed.

1139
01:19:55,380 --> 01:20:00,380
Well, okay, it's possible, it was a revolver, not likely, but it's possible.

1140
01:20:00,380 --> 01:20:05,380
But the one thing you can't argue with is it would have changed the odds.

1141
01:20:05,380 --> 01:20:12,380
I can't begin to tell you how frustrating it is to sit there and wait for it to be your

1142
01:20:12,380 --> 01:20:16,380
turn, and having no way, no means of defending yourself.

1143
01:20:16,380 --> 01:20:22,380
I can't imagine being in that position again and having my children or my grandchildren

1144
01:20:22,380 --> 01:20:26,380
with me and having no way of defending them makes me physically ill.

1145
01:20:26,380 --> 01:20:31,780
Well, we now have countless cases since you went public back in 91, 92, 93, where people

1146
01:20:31,780 --> 01:20:34,980
have at churches and everywhere else stopped gunmen.

1147
01:20:34,980 --> 01:20:40,260
Just happened down in San Antonio, it's just happened other places just since the Sandy

1148
01:20:40,260 --> 01:20:44,820
Hook shooting, and the media will not cover it nationally.

1149
01:20:44,820 --> 01:20:48,980
And we see these countless local news videos of gunmen coming in trying to shoot people

1150
01:20:48,980 --> 01:20:54,180
for no reason at shops and concealed carry folks that know how to use them, take them

1151
01:20:54,180 --> 01:20:55,180
out.

1152
01:20:55,180 --> 01:20:59,460
And I see the gun grabbers rushing in to try to ban guns right now, because they know the

1153
01:20:59,460 --> 01:21:04,820
gun culture and the self-defense culture is taking over society, all the top rated TV

1154
01:21:04,820 --> 01:21:05,820
shows.

1155
01:21:05,820 --> 01:21:13,580
Women out buying guns, liberal women's magazines show women with guns now, not because they

1156
01:21:13,580 --> 01:21:18,100
want guns, the liberal owners, but because they realize women have woken up.

1157
01:21:18,100 --> 01:21:22,740
They're losing, that's why they're launching this offensive against the Second Amendment.

1158
01:21:22,740 --> 01:21:25,740
Would you like to elaborate on that statement, do you agree or disagree?

1159
01:21:25,740 --> 01:21:33,500
I agree with you, but I do think that they see an opportunity here because of the Connecticut

1160
01:21:33,500 --> 01:21:34,500
shooting.

1161
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:42,740
It's so hard for any of us to imagine that all those little children being just executed

1162
01:21:42,740 --> 01:21:47,140
like that, it's just, you want a way-

1163
01:21:47,140 --> 01:21:48,820
And they put the guilt onto us.

1164
01:21:48,820 --> 01:21:55,380
Have you ever seen such demonization of gun owners where they say, we're Klan, we're Nazis,

1165
01:21:55,380 --> 01:22:00,340
we helped kill those children when it was a gun free zone and the media advertising

1166
01:22:00,340 --> 01:22:02,780
crazies go to schools and kill people.

1167
01:22:02,780 --> 01:22:05,340
If anybody has blood on their hands, it's them.

1168
01:22:05,340 --> 01:22:06,740
Isn't that the truth?

1169
01:22:06,740 --> 01:22:11,140
That's something that I've advocated for for years is for teachers to be able to carry.

1170
01:22:11,140 --> 01:22:15,420
And of course, here in Texas, individual schools can make that decision.

1171
01:22:15,420 --> 01:22:19,780
My school does not allow the teachers to carry, but I can tell you that I know a few that

1172
01:22:19,780 --> 01:22:20,780
carry anyway.

1173
01:22:20,780 --> 01:22:24,940
They just keep their mouth shut and do it, thank God.

1174
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:30,640
The bad guys, I don't know why people don't get this, bad guys like that want a high body

1175
01:22:30,640 --> 01:22:31,640
bag count.

1176
01:22:31,640 --> 01:22:36,380
They're gonna go where they think they can shoot as many people as possible without anybody

1177
01:22:36,380 --> 01:22:38,840
shooting back at them.

1178
01:22:38,840 --> 01:22:44,180
Nobody knows these cowards like you, no doubt your father saved your life.

1179
01:22:44,180 --> 01:22:49,380
Nobody knows these evil people like you, Susanna Hupp, a survivor of the Luby's Massacre, are

1180
01:22:49,380 --> 01:22:50,380
with us.

1181
01:22:50,380 --> 01:22:55,100
And really, the grandmother of the concealed carry movement, no doubt, not to use the term

1182
01:22:55,100 --> 01:22:59,740
grandmother like she's old, but she's the person that really started it.

1183
01:22:59,740 --> 01:23:01,840
Thank God and saved countless lives.

1184
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:05,940
Why do these cowards always commit suicide as soon as the cops show up?

1185
01:23:05,940 --> 01:23:11,780
I mean, it just shows they really are ghoulish demons that they all act exactly the same.

1186
01:23:11,780 --> 01:23:20,340
You know, I'm trying to teach my children, I have two boys, 16 and 14, and I think society

1187
01:23:20,340 --> 01:23:27,780
in general tries to teach people that these bad guys are just misunderstood, or they've

1188
01:23:27,780 --> 01:23:33,220
had a hard life, or all the various of thundery excuses that you can come up with for them.

1189
01:23:33,220 --> 01:23:38,180
I mean, I've actually literally had people asking me, why didn't you try to talk the

1190
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:39,180
guy down?

1191
01:23:39,180 --> 01:23:40,180
Like, really?

1192
01:23:40,180 --> 01:23:43,660
I mean, I can't even argue with that, it's such a stupid statement.

1193
01:23:43,660 --> 01:23:46,660
Yeah, just shot your dad in the chest, and then you're gonna go talk to him.

1194
01:23:46,660 --> 01:23:51,020
Let me go talk to this guy about his childhood.

1195
01:23:51,020 --> 01:23:57,140
What I'm trying to teach my children is that there certainly are criminals, I would say

1196
01:23:57,140 --> 01:24:02,340
the vast majority of criminals in the world that were created, they did have bad childhoods

1197
01:24:02,340 --> 01:24:03,340
and whatnot.

1198
01:24:03,340 --> 01:24:05,700
But there's also evil.

1199
01:24:05,700 --> 01:24:12,100
I honestly believe there is absolute evil that exists in the world.

1200
01:24:12,100 --> 01:24:13,100
That's my next point.

1201
01:24:13,100 --> 01:24:20,300
Have you noticed that with Son of Sam, Ramirez, the Night Stalker, Harrison Kleibold, Lanza,

1202
01:24:20,300 --> 01:24:24,580
and the guy that just shot the firefighters, they were all admitted devil worshipers.

1203
01:24:24,580 --> 01:24:28,180
Shouldn't we be profiling them?

1204
01:24:28,180 --> 01:24:31,580
I did not know that, but I'm not even slightly surprised.

1205
01:24:31,580 --> 01:24:36,700
Okay, maybe mildly surprised, but not shocked, have I passed?

1206
01:24:36,700 --> 01:24:37,700
It's incredible.

1207
01:24:37,700 --> 01:24:46,420
Evil exists, and I believe that you must do your best to stand between evil and innocent

1208
01:24:46,420 --> 01:24:47,420
evil.

1209
01:24:47,420 --> 01:24:51,220
And it doesn't mean, again, I want to make this clear, because I'll tell you what one

1210
01:24:51,220 --> 01:24:53,380
of my biggest fears is, Alex.

1211
01:24:53,380 --> 01:24:58,580
One of my biggest fears is that I'm gonna be in some position that I get shot and killed

1212
01:24:58,580 --> 01:25:05,780
by a bad guy, and I'm not able to get a round off for some reason.

1213
01:25:05,780 --> 01:25:11,340
And I'm so afraid that the other side is gonna say, see, her gun didn't help her.

1214
01:25:11,340 --> 01:25:18,500
And I've said it a million times, it's not a guarantee, it changes the odds.

1215
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:24,140
It means you're not a helpless prey animal to be fed upon by devil worshipers and psychopaths.

1216
01:25:24,140 --> 01:25:27,580
At least I'm not gonna be an easy target, I'm gonna do my best.

1217
01:25:27,580 --> 01:25:30,620
I'm gonna do my best to bloody them.

1218
01:25:30,620 --> 01:25:34,300
They might take me out, but I'm gonna do my best to put them in the hospital, at the very

1219
01:25:34,300 --> 01:25:35,300
least.

1220
01:25:35,300 --> 01:25:39,060
Everybody's gonna know who the bad guy is.

1221
01:25:39,060 --> 01:25:42,020
Here's the headline, Daily Mail, it's also in AP.

1222
01:25:42,020 --> 01:25:48,140
I am the devil, former classmate reveals school gunman had online devil worshiping page as

1223
01:25:48,140 --> 01:25:53,700
childhood barber recounts how he never spoke and just stared at floors.

1224
01:25:53,700 --> 01:26:00,840
And that's the shooter of the firefighters with Lanza, it's the same story.

1225
01:26:00,840 --> 01:26:03,540
So this just goes on and on.

1226
01:26:03,540 --> 01:26:12,660
So all of them, devil worshipers, here it is, Satan worship, the Sandy Hook, on and

1227
01:26:12,660 --> 01:26:13,660
on and on.

1228
01:26:13,660 --> 01:26:17,540
Son of Sam, Night Stalker, list goes on and on, it's amazing.

1229
01:26:17,540 --> 01:26:20,940
In the time we have here, cuz I know you've gotta go, maybe you can do five more minutes

1230
01:26:20,940 --> 01:26:25,220
after the break to talk about your book, which I need to carry at the Infowars online bookstore

1231
01:26:25,220 --> 01:26:26,980
because I know it's so important.

1232
01:26:26,980 --> 01:26:30,300
We all need to reach out to the dumbed down people that really think turning their guns

1233
01:26:30,300 --> 01:26:32,180
in is gonna protect them.

1234
01:26:32,180 --> 01:26:38,100
But looking at Dianne Feinstein, have you seen the testimony in Congress where she admits

1235
01:26:38,100 --> 01:26:41,420
she has a concealed carry but doesn't want you to be able?

1236
01:26:41,420 --> 01:26:46,820
I have seen written quotes from it, but I have not actually seen it, no.

1237
01:26:46,820 --> 01:26:47,820
It's amazing, though.

1238
01:26:47,820 --> 01:26:51,340
I mean, how can they all have bodyguards and she can be worth 100 billion bucks, but then

1239
01:26:51,340 --> 01:26:54,220
we're not supposed to have guns?

1240
01:26:54,220 --> 01:27:00,660
I remember being on CNN or one of those shows when Rosie O'Donnell, there had been some

1241
01:27:00,660 --> 01:27:06,820
incident with one of her adopted children and a bodyguard protected the child.

1242
01:27:06,820 --> 01:27:13,580
And I went on the air and said, she must be horribly, horribly, feel awfully silly at

1243
01:27:13,580 --> 01:27:17,980
the moment because she's telling all of us to disarm and most of us don't have her kind

1244
01:27:17,980 --> 01:27:24,100
of money that we can hire personal bodyguards for our kids and she must be terribly embarrassed.

1245
01:27:24,100 --> 01:27:28,980
But I feel that way pretty much about Feinstein and most of them, it's just an elitist attitude.

1246
01:27:28,980 --> 01:27:33,020
It's okay for me, but it's not for you because I don't trust you.

1247
01:27:33,020 --> 01:27:36,980
Well if you notice, I've even got Christian Science Monitor admitting, I have an article

1248
01:27:36,980 --> 01:27:41,540
that our government's trying to restrict free speech online and going the way of China.

1249
01:27:41,540 --> 01:27:46,180
I've got an article after you leave us, we're gonna go over where top Georgetown professors

1250
01:27:46,180 --> 01:27:49,300
saying yeah, go ahead and kill old people, death panels.

1251
01:27:49,300 --> 01:27:52,860
I mean, they're not just going after the Second Amendment, do you see it as a big canary in

1252
01:27:52,860 --> 01:28:01,860
the coal mine that they are this open and brazen right now?

1253
01:28:01,860 --> 01:28:05,340
Here's what I really think, Alex.

1254
01:28:05,340 --> 01:28:07,480
I don't think Obama is the problem.

1255
01:28:07,480 --> 01:28:10,200
I don't think Feinstein is the problem.

1256
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:16,700
I honestly believe that our public education system is the problem because those are the

1257
01:28:16,700 --> 01:28:22,020
people that are growing up to run for office that think socialism and Marxism is a good

1258
01:28:22,020 --> 01:28:23,020
thing.

1259
01:28:23,020 --> 01:28:27,980
They're the ones that grow up and vote for the Obamas and the Feinstein's.

1260
01:28:27,980 --> 01:28:34,580
So I truly believe, you know, you and I tend to attack this and a lot of partisans tend

1261
01:28:34,580 --> 01:28:38,780
to attack this at the top, you know, when we have to get so and so out of office or

1262
01:28:38,780 --> 01:28:40,460
into office.

1263
01:28:40,460 --> 01:28:46,980
And I really hope that the problem is down in the school system.

1264
01:28:46,980 --> 01:28:50,540
Have we crossed the Rubicon of becoming a collectivist society where they've got so

1265
01:28:50,540 --> 01:28:52,660
many people domesticated?

1266
01:28:52,660 --> 01:28:56,380
You know, they're like squirrels you feed in your backyard after a while, they don't

1267
01:28:56,380 --> 01:28:58,380
know how to go out and get their own food.

1268
01:28:58,380 --> 01:29:03,060
Yes, yes, and I was talking about this last night on the radio show, in fact, on the one

1269
01:29:03,060 --> 01:29:05,580
that I was filling in on in Austin.

1270
01:29:05,580 --> 01:29:12,020
Yes, I, unfortunately, I, I think we have hit the tipping point.

1271
01:29:12,020 --> 01:29:18,820
I and I think that's evidenced in this last presidential run.

1272
01:29:18,820 --> 01:29:24,100
I just think there are now more, you know, we were a little bit sheltered here in Texas,

1273
01:29:24,100 --> 01:29:27,100
because Texas is still a pretty Republican conservative.

1274
01:29:27,100 --> 01:29:30,540
I'll tell you what, I know you got to go, but we're gonna go to break, come back and

1275
01:29:30,540 --> 01:29:33,700
do five more minutes with us, and then we'll let you get back to work because I want to

1276
01:29:33,700 --> 01:29:38,220
finish up with the tipping point solutions and your book because there are ways to beat

1277
01:29:38,220 --> 01:29:39,220
this.

1278
01:29:39,220 --> 01:29:42,660
But it's just like in Poland, it's called non-compliance, we've got to do everything

1279
01:29:42,660 --> 01:29:44,580
we can before this becomes a shooting war.

1280
01:29:44,580 --> 01:29:50,340
We'll be right back with Susanna Hupp.

1281
01:29:50,340 --> 01:30:00,740
We're on the march, the empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

1282
01:30:00,740 --> 01:30:03,820
Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.

1283
01:30:03,820 --> 01:30:08,820
The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.

1284
01:30:08,820 --> 01:30:14,860
The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce

1285
01:30:14,860 --> 01:30:15,860
to the global takeover.

1286
01:30:15,860 --> 01:30:21,860

harmful pathogens.

hundred times the effectiveness of colloidal or ionic silver solutions.

It's Alex Jones.

1334
01:33:15,060 --> 01:33:34,860
Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live and we're finishing up with an interview we're

1335
01:33:34,860 --> 01:33:40,780
doing with Representative Susanna Hupp, former representative survivor of the Luby's Massacre.

1336
01:33:40,780 --> 01:33:46,740
Our book is from Luby's, the legislature, very highly rated at Amazon in the reviews

1337
01:33:46,740 --> 01:33:51,380
and is really good for people out there who don't understand what's going on.

1338
01:33:51,380 --> 01:33:56,020
We either reach out to the domesticated Obama-noids or it's over.

1339
01:33:56,020 --> 01:33:58,260
And the collectivist are very arrogant.

1340
01:33:58,260 --> 01:34:03,260
She just said people in Texas or other more constitutional areas, where the economy by

1341
01:34:03,260 --> 01:34:07,420
the way is still operating cuz we're not socialists completely, are in a bubble.

1342
01:34:07,420 --> 01:34:10,580
We think, they'll never have government run healthcare, they'll never make us pay for

1343
01:34:10,580 --> 01:34:11,580
abortions.

1344
01:34:11,580 --> 01:34:14,180
They'll never take over the Catholic Church and make them pay for abortions.

1345
01:34:14,180 --> 01:34:15,580
It's all happening.

1346
01:34:15,580 --> 01:34:17,260
They'll never do this, they'll never do that.

1347
01:34:17,260 --> 01:34:19,100
Really they've done this in every other country.

1348
01:34:19,100 --> 01:34:21,460
They're following a model.

1349
01:34:21,460 --> 01:34:24,000
And they're powerful corporate interests that want monopolies.

1350
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:29,020
They want a quasi-socialist system with a fascist system on top of it.

1351
01:34:29,020 --> 01:34:32,780
And there's also some hoaxing going on where they say this is a mandate for socialism cuz

1352
01:34:32,780 --> 01:34:34,220
Obama won again.

1353
01:34:34,220 --> 01:34:40,940
No, they ran a neo-con socialist Obamacare writing Mitt Romney.

1354
01:34:40,940 --> 01:34:43,060
So the fix is in is the problem.

1355
01:34:43,060 --> 01:34:46,980
Representative, I wanted to talk about your book some, but first, solutions.

1356
01:34:46,980 --> 01:34:52,580
If we have reached the tipping point of domestication, we know the solution is wait till it rots

1357
01:34:52,580 --> 01:34:54,700
and collapses like the Soviet Union.

1358
01:34:54,700 --> 01:34:56,140
Well that's gonna be authoritarianism.

1359
01:34:56,140 --> 01:34:58,620
I don't wanna be sent to the Gulag Archipelago.

1360
01:34:58,620 --> 01:35:04,140
How do we short circuit it before it gets really, really bad?

1361
01:35:04,140 --> 01:35:08,540
Well, you're not gonna like my answer.

1362
01:35:08,540 --> 01:35:10,540
I guess my answer is two-fold.

1363
01:35:10,540 --> 01:35:18,620
Number one, we truly, truly need to get into the school system and begin to re-teach what

1364
01:35:18,620 --> 01:35:22,860
made America great because they're not teaching it now.

1365
01:35:22,860 --> 01:35:25,060
They're teaching that socialism and Marxism is good.

1366
01:35:25,060 --> 01:35:27,100
What do you mean I don't like your answer?

1367
01:35:27,100 --> 01:35:29,680
I mean, I love, I mean, absolutely.

1368
01:35:29,680 --> 01:35:31,340
And look, the government's taken over.

1369
01:35:31,340 --> 01:35:33,540
It's time for us to do what the socialists did.

1370
01:35:33,540 --> 01:35:39,020
I think people should infiltrate government and do whatever you have to to get in there

1371
01:35:39,020 --> 01:35:41,660
to report on these people and sabotage these people.

1372
01:35:41,660 --> 01:35:43,660
Yes, yes, that's very well put.

1373
01:35:43,660 --> 01:35:49,660
Well, I said that you wouldn't like it because unfortunately, it's not a glamorous answer

1374
01:35:49,660 --> 01:35:53,580
and it's a slow task to make changes in the school system.

1375
01:35:53,580 --> 01:35:59,140
The second thing that you do brilliantly is teach people to be prepared.

1376
01:35:59,140 --> 01:36:05,780
And it used to be only us crazies that would stockpile food or stockpile water or ammunition

1377
01:36:05,780 --> 01:36:06,780
or whatever.

1378
01:36:06,780 --> 01:36:09,220
But now they actually have television shows about it.

1379
01:36:09,220 --> 01:36:13,860
It's not just crazies, it's not just people that are living for their front teeth.

1380
01:36:13,860 --> 01:36:16,060
But our grandparents all did that.

1381
01:36:16,060 --> 01:36:17,060
It's normal.

1382
01:36:17,060 --> 01:36:19,460
All mammals store some food.

1383
01:36:19,460 --> 01:36:22,260
I mean, even grasshoppers do it and they're insects.

1384
01:36:22,260 --> 01:36:28,620
I mean, you're crazy to just live day to day in some supermax prison-style grid.

1385
01:36:28,620 --> 01:36:31,380
Let me ask you this, then we'll talk about the book and let you go and hopefully get

1386
01:36:31,380 --> 01:36:32,780
you back soon.

1387
01:36:32,780 --> 01:36:37,020
I have a clip in my film In Game Blueprint for Global Enslavement.

1388
01:36:37,020 --> 01:36:40,820
And in it, it's you talking to the head of the psychiatry association.

1389
01:36:40,820 --> 01:36:48,500
And you say, why are 67% at that time of foster kids on psychotropics?

1390
01:36:48,500 --> 01:36:50,980
And you were heading up the committee and it was a big investigation.

1391
01:36:50,980 --> 01:36:52,820
And he says, they come from bad gene pools.

1392
01:36:52,820 --> 01:36:54,980
Well, A, that's what Hitler said.

1393
01:36:54,980 --> 01:36:58,600
B, they don't even do blood tests, quote, gene pools.

1394
01:36:58,600 --> 01:37:03,100
I mean, no, they grab kids from their parents and then drug them, as doctors have said.

1395
01:37:03,100 --> 01:37:04,420
What do you make of that?

1396
01:37:04,420 --> 01:37:06,860
That's not liberal drugging kids.

1397
01:37:06,860 --> 01:37:07,860
That's evil.

1398
01:37:07,860 --> 01:37:14,780
Yes, and in many, many, many cases, those children were on more than three psychotropic

1399
01:37:14,780 --> 01:37:15,780
drugs.

1400
01:37:15,780 --> 01:37:21,900
And many of them weren't even okay for children of the age that they were giving them to.

1401
01:37:21,900 --> 01:37:25,260
I'm deeply concerned with the drug culture.

1402
01:37:25,260 --> 01:37:28,700
And I don't want to, look, I don't want a bad mouthful of drugs.

1403
01:37:28,700 --> 01:37:32,140
Look, I just got off a run of antibiotics for a sinus infection, but there are good

1404
01:37:32,140 --> 01:37:33,140
drugs out there.

1405
01:37:33,140 --> 01:37:40,300
The problem is, this is one of the things that can be tricky in a free society.

1406
01:37:40,300 --> 01:37:46,660
We do have these enormous drug companies that push this stuff and actually get it wrapped

1407
01:37:46,660 --> 01:37:52,060
into the government system, where the doctors that are working on the foster kids, for instance,

1408
01:37:52,060 --> 01:37:55,820
have to follow a particular protocol in what drugs they use.

1409
01:37:55,820 --> 01:37:57,940
They can't deviate from that protocol.

1410
01:37:57,940 --> 01:38:04,340
So it's very interconnected and very difficult to unravel, quite frankly.

1411
01:38:04,340 --> 01:38:09,500
Well, that's right, in the public schools, it turns out, get more federal funding, the

1412
01:38:09,500 --> 01:38:12,700
more kids are, quote, special need on the drugs.

1413
01:38:12,700 --> 01:38:17,860
In fact, the WOAI investigation that spurred the state investigation, if you remember,

1414
01:38:17,860 --> 01:38:24,220
found that the national average was 67% of foster children are on psychotropics, and

1415
01:38:24,220 --> 01:38:29,460
the average child was on seven drugs.

1416
01:38:29,460 --> 01:38:30,460
Seven drugs.

1417
01:38:30,460 --> 01:38:31,460
Yeah, which is crazy.

1418
01:38:31,460 --> 01:38:35,940
I mean, that in and of itself is crazy.

1419
01:38:35,940 --> 01:38:44,020
And there is absolutely, my husband is a neuropsychologist, so I would go to him and use him for information

1420
01:38:44,020 --> 01:38:45,420
on a regular basis.

1421
01:38:45,420 --> 01:38:51,620
And you're right, unfortunately, there is a financial benefit to not only the school

1422
01:38:51,620 --> 01:38:53,620
system, but the parents.

1423
01:38:53,620 --> 01:39:01,900
There was a kind of a negative, basically, they would go in and a lot of them, not all

1424
01:39:01,900 --> 01:39:05,340
of them, but a lot of them would go in and say, well, this kid's creating a lot of problems

1425
01:39:05,340 --> 01:39:07,780
for me, he really needs to be on medication.

1426
01:39:07,780 --> 01:39:11,740
Somebody would put him on medication, and the foster family would get more money per

1427
01:39:11,740 --> 01:39:13,220
day because of it.

1428
01:39:13,220 --> 01:39:17,180
And then the medication makes them worse, so the answer is not get them off drugs, get

1429
01:39:17,180 --> 01:39:18,180
them on more.

1430
01:39:18,180 --> 01:39:21,580
They're eating Twinkies, they're drinking Cokes with caffeine, they're eating, I mean,

1431
01:39:21,580 --> 01:39:26,100
my children, if they get red dye or something in a candy on vacation, we let them eat it

1432
01:39:26,100 --> 01:39:27,100
or something.

1433
01:39:27,100 --> 01:39:28,100
They go nuts, don't they?

1434
01:39:28,100 --> 01:39:29,100
They go crazy.

1435
01:39:29,100 --> 01:39:32,460
And then it turns out those dyes have a drug effect.

1436
01:39:32,460 --> 01:39:37,420
The kids are bouncing off the walls cuz they should be eating steak and potatoes and broccoli

1437
01:39:37,420 --> 01:39:39,300
and exercising all day.

1438
01:39:39,300 --> 01:39:44,020
Instead, I mean, if I drank Cokes and ate Twinkies, when I come down off of it, I've

1439
01:39:44,020 --> 01:39:46,420
done it a few times, I wanna beat the hell out of people.

1440
01:39:46,420 --> 01:39:47,420
I mean, no wonder the-

1441
01:39:47,420 --> 01:39:48,420
Particularly young boys.

1442
01:39:48,420 --> 01:39:49,420
Particularly young boys.

1443
01:39:49,420 --> 01:39:54,620
I mean, it used to amaze me to watch the teachers, they were taught to give the little boys time

1444
01:39:54,620 --> 01:39:55,620
out.

1445
01:39:55,620 --> 01:40:00,900
Instead of what they should be doing is telling them to go outside and run around with schools

1446
01:40:00,900 --> 01:40:01,900
five times.

1447
01:40:01,900 --> 01:40:05,580
Well, you know public schools first got rid of dodge ball, now most of them have banned

1448
01:40:05,580 --> 01:40:06,580
running.

1449
01:40:06,580 --> 01:40:11,980
So I mean, of course, young mammals, I mean, that'd be like drugging a puppy because it

1450
01:40:11,980 --> 01:40:14,140
runs around and chews on the other puppy.

1451
01:40:14,140 --> 01:40:15,140
Yes.

1452
01:40:15,140 --> 01:40:17,020
I mean, baby mammals all act the same.

1453
01:40:17,020 --> 01:40:18,540
Ma'am, you're amazing.

1454
01:40:18,540 --> 01:40:22,540
Thank you for your time and thank you for getting your testimony out there that the

1455
01:40:22,540 --> 01:40:25,940
answer is more guns, less crime.

1456
01:40:25,940 --> 01:40:29,100
Tell us briefly about your book.

1457
01:40:29,100 --> 01:40:37,020
I wrote that book for the average person to read and be able to make the arguments with

1458
01:40:37,020 --> 01:40:38,020
their neighbors and friends.

1459
01:40:38,020 --> 01:40:41,540
It's also a great book to pass on- You know who I really wrote that book for?

1460
01:40:41,540 --> 01:40:47,420
I wrote that book for a housewife that just aren't sure how they feel about guns.

1461
01:40:47,420 --> 01:40:52,180
You know, they're not into going out and blasting Bambi and they're just uncomfortable

1462
01:40:52,180 --> 01:40:54,900
with things that go make a loud bang.

1463
01:40:54,900 --> 01:40:58,020
And I understand that, I completely understand that.

1464
01:40:58,020 --> 01:41:02,180
And I'm a mother and I've been there, I understand, I'm not into going out and blasting Bambi

1465
01:41:02,180 --> 01:41:03,180
either.

1466
01:41:03,180 --> 01:41:06,940
But it's a quick, easy read and it's for those people.

1467
01:41:06,940 --> 01:41:07,940
Absolutely.

1468
01:41:07,940 --> 01:41:11,780
Well, you know, you've got two sons, I've got two daughters and a son and I love them

1469
01:41:11,780 --> 01:41:14,060
like life itself or more.

1470
01:41:14,060 --> 01:41:18,780
But it is really a good feeling now that my eight year old is shooting and hitting bull's

1471
01:41:18,780 --> 01:41:20,460
eye at 50 yards.

1472
01:41:20,460 --> 01:41:22,420
We haven't trained the four year old yet.

1473
01:41:22,420 --> 01:41:25,980
And it's such a good feeling that my girls are tough.

1474
01:41:25,980 --> 01:41:28,620
Because they punch me when we're playing and it really hurts.

1475
01:41:28,620 --> 01:41:32,660
And that they're not putting up with anybody trying to rape them or attack them.

1476
01:41:32,660 --> 01:41:35,980
And then I'm gonna defend the Second Amendment so when they go off to college or when they

1477
01:41:35,980 --> 01:41:40,160
get married and they live, some guy bust into their apartment or into their house to try

1478
01:41:40,160 --> 01:41:42,760
to beat them up or rape them, they're dead.

1479
01:41:42,760 --> 01:41:45,360
And that's real empowerment.

1480
01:41:45,360 --> 01:41:50,140
And it's not feminism, it's survival, it's basic common sense.

1481
01:41:50,140 --> 01:41:55,180
And as I said, our culture of liberty, the women's magazines, the Austin Chronicle's

1482
01:41:55,180 --> 01:41:57,380
been having articles about women's shooting.

1483
01:41:57,380 --> 01:42:03,220
Not because the Socialist Anti-American Chronicle, run by a horrible guy who I know, wants to

1484
01:42:03,220 --> 01:42:04,220
do that.

1485
01:42:04,220 --> 01:42:07,840
They're being forced to do that if people are gonna pick up their magazines.

1486
01:42:07,840 --> 01:42:12,300
And our culture of liberty and self empowerment is growing.

1487
01:42:12,300 --> 01:42:14,500
And so that's why the empire is striking back.

1488
01:42:14,500 --> 01:42:18,420
And your book breaks that down and I hope everybody gets it and gives it to women who

1489
01:42:18,420 --> 01:42:21,300
are anti-gun in their family or who are on the fence.

1490
01:42:21,300 --> 01:42:22,820
Thank you very much.

1491
01:42:22,820 --> 01:42:27,780
All right, we'll have a great week coming up and I always enjoy getting to hear you

1492
01:42:27,780 --> 01:42:29,420
on 590 AM when you're filling in.

1493
01:42:29,420 --> 01:42:30,420
God bless.

1494
01:42:30,420 --> 01:42:31,420
Thank you very much.

1495
01:42:31,420 --> 01:42:32,420
Happy New Year.

1496
01:42:32,420 --> 01:42:33,420
You too.

1497
01:42:33,420 --> 01:42:34,420
There it goes.

1498
01:42:34,420 --> 01:42:36,700
Our representative, Susanna Hupp, survivor of the Luby's massacre.

1499
01:42:36,700 --> 01:42:38,900
We're gonna get her back on in a few months.

1500
01:42:38,900 --> 01:42:40,940
Maybe even sometime have her come in and fill in.

1501
01:42:40,940 --> 01:42:42,580
She lives on there, Austin.

1502
01:42:42,580 --> 01:42:45,420
She does that for our local affiliate, just an amazing lady.

1503
01:42:45,420 --> 01:42:49,540
Boy, I tell you.

1504
01:42:49,540 --> 01:42:55,060
Ladies and gentlemen, I said that I would get into agenda 21 because I was really brainstorming

1505
01:42:55,060 --> 01:42:57,220
on it last night and this morning.

1506
01:42:57,220 --> 01:43:01,640
And how it ties into things, what the Obamacare means, what the death panels mean, what life

1507
01:43:01,640 --> 01:43:02,640
is really gonna be like.

1508
01:43:02,640 --> 01:43:06,060
Cuz I always mention this or that or say I'm gonna break it down and I've done some special

1509
01:43:06,060 --> 01:43:07,060
reports.

1510
01:43:07,060 --> 01:43:14,700
But then I get an hour and 43 minutes into this and I'm not so much exhausted as that

1511
01:43:14,700 --> 01:43:19,100
it's a feeling of I can't do this justice.

1512
01:43:19,100 --> 01:43:20,400
I can't do this justice.

1513
01:43:20,400 --> 01:43:26,900
So what I wanna do is I'm gonna go to your calls until eight after next hour, seven after.

1514
01:43:26,900 --> 01:43:29,740
And then I'll cover this for a segment and continue with your calls, pardon my New Year's

1515
01:43:29,740 --> 01:43:30,740
resolution.

1516
01:43:30,740 --> 01:43:35,060
And I want the crew in there cuz I don't have a quote producer that tells me what to do.

1517
01:43:35,060 --> 01:43:40,020
I kind of have radio bookers and a great crew that runs the TV and does research.

1518
01:43:40,020 --> 01:43:45,820
But I need you guys to make me that when I say I'm taking calls, get to them, get to

1519
01:43:45,820 --> 01:43:47,460
them quick, cycle through them.

1520
01:43:47,460 --> 01:43:50,660
Cuz it brings up a lot of really important angles and issues.

1521
01:43:50,660 --> 01:43:51,900
And I like taking calls.

1522
01:43:51,900 --> 01:43:55,820
Whenever I'm listening to rebroadcast, I'm like, I wish you'd take calls, Alex.

1523
01:43:55,820 --> 01:44:01,900
But again, it's just that I've got so much information I wanna get to you.

1524
01:44:01,900 --> 01:44:08,580
Agenda 21 is taking civilization and militarizing it against the people.

1525
01:44:08,580 --> 01:44:13,780
And it is the strangulation of humanity.

1526
01:44:13,780 --> 01:44:20,980
It is the scientific exterminism, an ultra-Hitlerian, incremental, scientifically controlled kill

1527
01:44:20,980 --> 01:44:23,860
grid.

1528
01:44:23,860 --> 01:44:27,420
And I'm gonna attempt to really talk about it and give you some examples and tell you

1529
01:44:27,420 --> 01:44:28,420
where it's going.

1530
01:44:28,420 --> 01:44:35,780
And remember, I told you 15 years ago the printer ink was tracking everything you do.

1531
01:44:35,780 --> 01:44:39,340
And putting where you bought the printer, what you did, a whole record of it on there.

1532
01:44:39,340 --> 01:44:43,420
I told you that 10 years ago smart meters were going in that would control your temperature

1533
01:44:43,420 --> 01:44:47,980
and track everything you do and be later used to charge you more.

1534
01:44:47,980 --> 01:44:52,060
And interface with all your appliances that all have spy tech being built into them.

1535
01:44:52,060 --> 01:44:55,020
Now it's mainstream news because it's ubiquitous.

1536
01:44:55,020 --> 01:45:00,340
See, they always say, that's crazy counting on you being ignorant when it's first going

1537
01:45:00,340 --> 01:45:03,700
in cuz they don't want you to resist it at that point.

1538
01:45:03,700 --> 01:45:07,500
But once it's ubiquitous, they go, yeah, we are listening to you with the NSA, all of

1539
01:45:07,500 --> 01:45:08,500
you.

1540
01:45:08,500 --> 01:45:11,180
Yeah, the NSA is tracking everything you do.

1541
01:45:11,180 --> 01:45:12,780
Yeah, we are reading what you say.

1542
01:45:12,780 --> 01:45:20,980
You know what, the post office is opening some of your letters.

1543
01:45:20,980 --> 01:45:25,180
You know what, yeah, okay, well, government apologizes for shooting kids up in Guatemala

1544
01:45:25,180 --> 01:45:26,180
with live syphilis.

1545
01:45:26,180 --> 01:45:29,900
We're sorry, but we're gonna keep doing it.

1546
01:45:29,900 --> 01:45:35,500
I mean, I sit here looking at all the admissions, these are not my opinions.

1547
01:45:35,500 --> 01:45:38,500
And then I go study, let me see who that bank chairman is.

1548
01:45:38,500 --> 01:45:41,900
Let's go see if he gives money to eugenics organizations.

1549
01:45:41,900 --> 01:45:48,140
You go look it up, population reduction funds, and Nature Conservancy, and Sierra Club, and

1550
01:45:48,140 --> 01:45:51,660
all these anti-human groups that claim they care about the Earth.

1551
01:45:51,660 --> 01:45:52,660
It's always the same.

1552
01:45:52,660 --> 01:46:00,220
There's only a few thousand of them, and they're all, all into the same thing.

1553
01:46:00,220 --> 01:46:01,220
All of them.

1554
01:46:01,220 --> 01:46:05,680
I can randomly pick some globalist calling for gun control and go find out they're calling

1555
01:46:05,680 --> 01:46:07,420
for the end of the First Amendment authoritarianism.

1556
01:46:07,420 --> 01:46:14,380
I mean, these are monsters who have a mesmerized population watching television all day.

1557
01:46:14,380 --> 01:46:20,620
The television and the false culture is like a black hole destroying the real world.

1558
01:46:20,620 --> 01:46:23,100
It's sucking it in and wrecking minds.

1559
01:46:23,100 --> 01:46:26,420
And there are people that really think television's their friends.

1560
01:46:26,420 --> 01:46:29,140
They're imaginary friends on their favorite show.

1561
01:46:29,140 --> 01:46:33,540
And they sit there and basically talk to the television, and they get sad when they give

1562
01:46:33,540 --> 01:46:35,260
them the cue to about the dead kids.

1563
01:46:35,260 --> 01:46:39,940
It's Sandy Hook, but not sad when somebody protests and jumps up during a meeting about

1564
01:46:39,940 --> 01:46:44,220
thousands of dead kids from military strikes.

1565
01:46:44,220 --> 01:46:46,900
And they're just programmable biological androids.

1566
01:46:46,900 --> 01:46:48,340
That's what the globalists call you.

1567
01:46:48,340 --> 01:46:52,940
They call you human resources programmable, and I'm not a programmable.

1568
01:46:52,940 --> 01:46:57,040
Let me tell you something, you psychopaths are the most programmable.

1569
01:46:57,040 --> 01:47:01,600
You sit there and look at a regular folks who are weak minded and childlike because

1570
01:47:01,600 --> 01:47:04,540
you got them when they were babies in front of the television.

1571
01:47:04,540 --> 01:47:08,820
And you think you're powerful because you're socially engineering people with subliminals

1572
01:47:08,820 --> 01:47:09,820
and all the rest of it.

1573
01:47:09,820 --> 01:47:15,380
I've studied psychopaths and their servant sociopaths and their mercenaries and the different

1574
01:47:15,380 --> 01:47:18,860
classes that serve them, different criminal classes that serve darkness because they get

1575
01:47:18,860 --> 01:47:22,540
to engage in their particular poison.

1576
01:47:22,540 --> 01:47:27,700
You guys are totally obsessive compulsive, if you wanna use that limited term.

1577
01:47:27,700 --> 01:47:30,340
It doesn't fully describe it, but it's a term people can get.

1578
01:47:30,340 --> 01:47:31,460
It's similar to that.

1579
01:47:31,460 --> 01:47:33,140
You guys are ritualistic.

1580
01:47:33,140 --> 01:47:34,620
You guys aren't alive.

1581
01:47:34,620 --> 01:47:38,700
You're not really creating, you're twisting.

1582
01:47:38,700 --> 01:47:41,380
You are not creating literature, music.

1583
01:47:41,380 --> 01:47:43,060
You are not creating art.

1584
01:47:43,060 --> 01:47:44,980
You are not creating beauty.

1585
01:47:44,980 --> 01:47:45,980
You are not.

1586
01:47:45,980 --> 01:47:47,260
You guys are missing out.

1587
01:47:47,260 --> 01:47:50,220
And a lot of you, it is from inbreeding and things.

1588
01:47:50,220 --> 01:47:53,900
There is such a thing as genetic psychopaths.

1589
01:47:53,900 --> 01:47:57,140
Most of them are genetic.

1590
01:47:57,140 --> 01:48:01,620
Royalty takes really aggressive, generally psychopaths are very manipulative dominance

1591
01:48:01,620 --> 01:48:03,220
and breeds them into psychopaths.

1592
01:48:03,220 --> 01:48:07,660
That's why you get these robotic classes that are just ready to do anything.

1593
01:48:07,660 --> 01:48:13,260
And they always like the same thing, black uniforms, burning cities, torturing children.

1594
01:48:13,260 --> 01:48:15,340
They all do it through, I mean, you studied history?

1595
01:48:15,340 --> 01:48:16,340
Any of you?

1596
01:48:16,340 --> 01:48:21,940
Every culture, black uniforms, burning children on fires, mass death.

1597
01:48:21,940 --> 01:48:27,060
Because good people don't have the sheepdog instinct to get in there and deal with these

1598
01:48:27,060 --> 01:48:28,060
people.

1599
01:48:28,060 --> 01:48:31,500
And by the way, we're a lot stronger and more inventive and powerful.

1600
01:48:31,500 --> 01:48:35,740
And by the way, we have levers that we don't enjoy crushing, we don't enjoy killing, but

1601
01:48:35,740 --> 01:48:38,500
we can do it a lot better than they can.

1602
01:48:38,500 --> 01:48:41,340
That's the thing, a lot of people get into evil because they feel weak.

1603
01:48:41,340 --> 01:48:43,500
They're not really psychopaths or sociopaths.

1604
01:48:43,500 --> 01:48:46,300
They get into evil believing it will give them power.

1605
01:48:46,300 --> 01:48:50,140
And then by example and modeling, they're able to do outrageous things, which is kinda

1606
01:48:50,140 --> 01:48:51,140
like building their self-confidence.

1607
01:48:51,140 --> 01:48:55,500
Honestly, just go take a Toastmasters, and I've never taken one of those, but I've read

1608
01:48:55,500 --> 01:48:59,900
about them, course for something if you wanna be confident, instead of going out and doing

1609
01:48:59,900 --> 01:49:01,860
evil things.

1610
01:49:01,860 --> 01:49:05,700
And those of us, see, evil people only have what they call evil.

1611
01:49:05,700 --> 01:49:13,220
And they do bad things and hurtful things for the power and the enjoyment.

1612
01:49:13,220 --> 01:49:17,540
The Bible says thou shalt not murder, and it's mistranslated as kill, cuz the whole

1613
01:49:17,540 --> 01:49:23,540
Bible's about go out and defend yourself, go out and kill the enemy that's attacking

1614
01:49:23,540 --> 01:49:24,540
you.

1615
01:49:24,540 --> 01:49:28,620
It's murder, premeditated, an innocent, knocking somebody on the head who's walking through

1616
01:49:28,620 --> 01:49:32,820
the path who's got a bag of food you want 3,000 years ago.

1617
01:49:32,820 --> 01:49:35,260
That's murder.

1618
01:49:35,260 --> 01:49:41,020
But to kill, to defend yourself is what God demands.

1619
01:49:41,020 --> 01:49:46,860
Because if you don't, the wolves take over when you act like a sheep.

1620
01:49:46,860 --> 01:49:50,420
So I'll come back, take a few calls in the next two segments, then get into agenda 21.

1621
01:49:50,420 --> 01:49:56,080
But you need to understand, folks, that you have innate power.

1622
01:49:56,080 --> 01:50:00,740
You have an entire electrochemical software system and all the instincts, and it's been

1623
01:50:00,740 --> 01:50:07,020
proven scientifically, the racial memories that are more just like essence data.

1624
01:50:07,020 --> 01:50:10,960
It's not like an actual exact memory.

1625
01:50:10,960 --> 01:50:14,240
You have all of this, you only have to access it.

1626
01:50:14,240 --> 01:50:16,060
You're not accessing your programming.

1627
01:50:16,060 --> 01:50:21,180
I mean, you ask God, the universe, whatever you believe it is, to help you be someone

1628
01:50:21,180 --> 01:50:25,120
who stands up for good.

1629
01:50:25,120 --> 01:50:31,940
You're also asking your subconscious to activate.

1630
01:50:31,940 --> 01:50:39,120
And then once you open the door, God can spiritually energize you, because you are a biological

1631
01:50:39,120 --> 01:50:41,860
android with a spirit.

1632
01:50:41,860 --> 01:50:48,060
This is an Earth suit, but you've got to open the door and say, okay, programming activated,

1633
01:50:48,060 --> 01:50:52,300
and then ask the creator of the universe, because God's for free will.

1634
01:50:52,300 --> 01:50:54,740
You've got to say, I'm ready.

1635
01:50:54,740 --> 01:50:55,740
You understand?

1636
01:50:55,740 --> 01:50:56,740
Give me the knowledge.

1637
01:50:56,740 --> 01:50:57,740
Please, for good.

1638
01:50:57,740 --> 01:50:58,740
I'm ready.

1639
01:50:58,740 --> 01:50:59,740
I'm ready.

1640
01:50:59,740 --> 01:51:04,900
Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the bestselling book, Cancer Step Outside the

1641
01:51:04,900 --> 01:51:05,900
Box.

1642
01:51:05,900 --> 01:51:08,820
I want you to know some very important information.

1643
01:51:08,820 --> 01:51:13,620
In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White

1644
01:51:13,620 --> 01:51:17,940
House at a time when only the president could obtain this world class healer.

1645
01:51:17,940 --> 01:51:23,520
Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.

1646
01:51:23,520 --> 01:51:28,580
Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally

1647
01:51:28,580 --> 01:51:33,740
occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single

1648
01:51:33,740 --> 01:51:34,880
normal cell.

1649
01:51:34,880 --> 01:51:38,620
If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune

1650
01:51:38,620 --> 01:51:42,620
cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.

1651
01:51:42,620 --> 01:51:53,580
Call 1-866-VenusFly or order from Carnivora.com, that's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A.com.

1652
01:51:53,580 --> 01:51:57,940
That's 1-866-836-8735, 1-866-VenusFly or visit Carnivora.com.

1653
01:51:57,940 --> 01:51:58,940
Protect your immune system.

1654
01:51:58,940 --> 01:52:00,820
It's the only one you've got.

1655
01:52:00,820 --> 01:52:04,220
Hey there, Frank Bates here.

1656
01:52:04,220 --> 01:52:09,300
Have you heard about the weird device that could wipe out 280 million Americans?

1657
01:52:09,300 --> 01:52:11,340
This is really scary stuff.

1658
01:52:11,340 --> 01:52:16,300
Bates experts warn that this odd device poses the gravest threat we've ever known.

1659
01:52:16,300 --> 01:52:20,600
In fact, just a few weeks ago, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich wrote an op-ed

1660
01:52:20,600 --> 01:52:23,780
piece for the Washington Post warning about this deadly threat.

1661
01:52:23,780 --> 01:52:27,140
I can't believe that more people aren't talking about this.

1662
01:52:27,140 --> 01:52:31,040
It may be because the liberals and the government are trying to cover it up.

1663
01:52:31,040 --> 01:52:36,700
That's why my friend just created a free video at weirddevice.com that exposes this threat

1664
01:52:36,700 --> 01:52:39,500
and blows the doors off the conspiracy.

1665
01:52:39,500 --> 01:52:45,360
Go watch the shocking video at weirddevice.com right now to discover exactly what it is plus

1666
01:52:45,360 --> 01:52:49,900
discover the number one way you and your family can survive this deadly attack.

1667
01:52:49,900 --> 01:52:54,820
I'm not sure how long this video will be online, so go to weirddevice.com before it's gone

1668
01:52:54,820 --> 01:52:55,820
forever.

1669
01:52:55,820 --> 01:52:57,820
Again, that's weirddevice.com.

1670
01:52:57,820 --> 01:53:04,580
Hi, my name is Annette and due to menopause symptoms for nearly two years, I suffered

1671
01:53:04,580 --> 01:53:07,940
severe heart clashes which prevented me from sleeping all night.

1672
01:53:07,940 --> 01:53:12,300
It was so hard to work because I continued all day to have the hot flashes from hell.

1673
01:53:12,300 --> 01:53:14,980
I was exhausted and depleted.

1674
01:53:14,980 --> 01:53:19,380
After only three weeks on one world weight, I have no hot flashes and I'm sleeping normally

1675
01:53:19,380 --> 01:53:20,380
again.

1676
01:53:20,380 --> 01:53:22,500
I feel energized and strong.

1677
01:53:22,500 --> 01:53:23,820
This is an amazing product.

1678
01:53:23,820 --> 01:53:27,300
It is a little known fact that every single cell of your body is supposed to produce ten

1679
01:53:27,300 --> 01:53:33,400
percent of its protein content as glutathione, but due to toxicity and aging, it does not.

1680
01:53:33,400 --> 01:53:37,580
Could glutathione be a missing factor in optimal cell function for your entire body?

1681
01:53:37,580 --> 01:53:41,420
If you restore the optimal glutathione levels in your cells, especially your glands and

1682
01:53:41,420 --> 01:53:44,660
organs, then as a result, your glands and organs work better.

1683
01:53:44,660 --> 01:53:47,420
Imagine the quality of life improvement you might have.

1684
01:53:47,420 --> 01:53:51,660
To order One World Way, call 888-988-3325.

1685
01:53:51,660 --> 01:53:54,380
That's 888-988-3325.

1686
01:53:54,380 --> 01:53:56,380
Or visit oneworldway.com.

1687
01:53:56,380 --> 01:54:01,980
That's one world W-H-E-Y dot com.

1688
01:54:01,980 --> 01:54:08,300
The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show, because there's

1689
01:54:08,300 --> 01:54:11,820
a war on for your mind.

1690
01:54:11,820 --> 01:54:25,900
By the way, the petition to deport Piers Morgan has reached 114,000 right now.

1691
01:54:25,900 --> 01:54:29,940
I bet we can probably punch that up on screen for viewers.

1692
01:54:29,940 --> 01:54:34,000
It's also linked up at the drugsreport.com, or at least it was.

1693
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:40,700
So now it's 100,139, since we printed this off a few minutes ago, another 100 or so signatures.

1694
01:54:40,700 --> 01:54:44,020
By the way, just to be clear, cuz my own crew thought this, they're all like, we didn't

1695
01:54:44,020 --> 01:54:45,780
see you on Piers Morgan last night.

1696
01:54:45,780 --> 01:54:51,920
I told the crew, I said, when Piers Morgan comes back from vacation, I'm supposedly on

1697
01:54:51,920 --> 01:54:54,660
his show the 7th, but I said, don't hold your breath.

1698
01:54:54,660 --> 01:54:58,340
I said that on air as well, so people may not have heard that right on air.

1699
01:54:58,340 --> 01:55:02,220
It's the 7th on there, and I bet they check it out.

1700
01:55:02,220 --> 01:55:05,620
I really could care less, it's not that big of an audience, but it would be an Internet

1701
01:55:05,620 --> 01:55:09,180
hit to go in there and obscure him.

1702
01:55:09,180 --> 01:55:13,540
And you'll hear him call me a pathetic person and stuff, that's just ridiculous.

1703
01:55:13,540 --> 01:55:18,940
Let's go ahead and go to John in New Hampshire, welcome, sir, thanks for holding.

1704
01:55:18,940 --> 01:55:22,340
Okay, Alex, Temple Warrior from New Hampshire.

1705
01:55:22,340 --> 01:55:28,660
I listened to you from the start when you started, and I know you made a lot of good

1706
01:55:28,660 --> 01:55:37,340
points with me, how I'm a former law enforcement official and now I'm a selectman in New Hampshire.

1707
01:55:37,340 --> 01:55:45,020
And the thing that got to me was we have to take back all these local town and city positions

1708
01:55:45,020 --> 01:55:47,180
and get back, take back our government.

1709
01:55:47,180 --> 01:55:55,020
So I ran for selectman, I was elected, and they stuck in, tried to sneak in that UN Agenda

1710
01:55:55,020 --> 01:56:00,820
21 into our town with a grant and all these promises, and I had been enlightened from

1711
01:56:00,820 --> 01:56:07,400
your show, and then when it came up, I questioned it, and naturally when I brought up anything

1712
01:56:07,400 --> 01:56:14,100
with the word UN Agenda 21, they thought I was crazy, but when it came down to the vote,

1713
01:56:14,100 --> 01:56:17,740
it was a split vote and my vote was a deciding vote and-

1714
01:56:17,740 --> 01:56:22,360
And by the way, you know that's all an act, they now say we're insane, Israeli citizens

1715
01:56:22,360 --> 01:56:24,820
can't own guns and teachers aren't armed.

1716
01:56:24,820 --> 01:56:30,060
It's a known fact they are, they just go, no, because we'd win the debate that Israel

1717
01:56:30,060 --> 01:56:32,740
ended its school shootings by arming the teachers.

1718
01:56:32,740 --> 01:56:37,800
So they go, instead of debating us on that, they go, no, Israel doesn't have guns.

1719
01:56:37,800 --> 01:56:41,780
So it's the same thing, they put out talking point manuals, it's even come out in the New

1720
01:56:41,780 --> 01:56:46,720
York Times on how to deal with you, to act like it doesn't exist.

1721
01:56:46,720 --> 01:56:52,620
That laughing at you and all that is part of the mind game, but again, you kept getting

1722
01:56:52,620 --> 01:56:58,700
the word out and all these masters owning things are authoritarian, they're designed

1723
01:56:58,700 --> 01:57:04,260
for any town, China and India and Mexico don't have these rules, the globalist all run those

1724
01:57:04,260 --> 01:57:07,220
countries, it's forcing all our industry out, it's a takeover.

1725
01:57:07,220 --> 01:57:08,740
I'm sorry, go ahead and finish your point.

1726
01:57:08,740 --> 01:57:14,980
So I came down to a split vote and I was the deciding vote and I shut it down, and you

1727
01:57:14,980 --> 01:57:19,900
would have thought I was Jack the Ripper, but I felt great that day and I told them

1728
01:57:19,900 --> 01:57:23,500
they're not gonna get it back as long as I'm on the selectman's board.

1729
01:57:23,500 --> 01:57:26,540
So did I hear you right that you were a police officer, now you've run and gotten into the

1730
01:57:26,540 --> 01:57:30,620
selectmen or city council, what a beautiful story.

1731
01:57:30,620 --> 01:57:35,300
And patriots, now I'm never a person for deception, I think you should be honest that you're a

1732
01:57:35,300 --> 01:57:41,420
libertarian or constitutionalist or whatever you call yourself, a liberty lover.

1733
01:57:41,420 --> 01:57:47,980
But I think it's good to get in, see they infiltrated us by acting like they were just

1734
01:57:47,980 --> 01:57:50,460
liberals when they're really authoritarians.

1735
01:57:50,460 --> 01:57:55,620
I think it's important to get our people in acting like we're not that threatening to

1736
01:57:55,620 --> 01:58:00,020
get in and then it's a lot easier to stay in, what's your take on that?

1737
01:58:00,020 --> 01:58:05,540
That's exactly what I did when I was first in town, some of the leftist organizations

1738
01:58:05,540 --> 01:58:10,020
invited me to state who I was and what I had in mind.

1739
01:58:10,020 --> 01:58:16,920
And I just yest them to death and let them believe I was a good person, which I am.

1740
01:58:16,920 --> 01:58:23,900
And then when the key votes came in town, we get a constitutional chief of police and

1741
01:58:23,900 --> 01:58:27,540
we just put in a great town administrator and I'm sure they're-

1742
01:58:27,540 --> 01:58:29,660
That's it, exactly, exactly.

1743
01:58:29,660 --> 01:58:34,060
And again, most of the mainline liberals are well-meaning, they're just helpless fools,

1744
01:58:34,060 --> 01:58:35,340
but again, exactly.

1745
01:58:35,340 --> 01:58:40,700
And then once you get in, you can educate them, we've got to use the enemy's tactics.

1746

Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.

1762
02:00:05,740 --> 02:00:10,580
Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.

1763
02:00:10,580 --> 02:00:11,580
You want answers?

1764
02:00:11,580 --> 02:00:13,700
Well, so does he.

1765
02:00:13,700 --> 02:00:17,900
He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.

1766
02:00:17,900 --> 02:00:24,860
And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.

1767
02:00:24,860 --> 02:00:30,060
And to quantify what I was just saying, I don't mean to use all their tactics, but you

1768
02:00:30,060 --> 02:00:32,740
got to know when to hold them, know when to fold them, know when to walk away, know when

1769
02:00:32,740 --> 02:00:33,740
to run.

1770
02:00:33,740 --> 02:00:39,540
I would have never gotten into Bohemian Grove if when I was questioned by the feds and others,

1771
02:00:39,540 --> 02:00:42,960
I didn't say, I'm with hillbillies.

1772
02:00:42,960 --> 02:00:46,820
And technically, that's the name of one of the clubs inside the Grove, and I guess I

1773
02:00:46,820 --> 02:00:51,140
am kind of a hillbilly, I'm from a bunch of East Texas blood, I mean, that's pretty hillbilly.

1774
02:00:51,140 --> 02:00:56,740
But the point is, it's all semantical, because this is a foreign occupying globalist force.

1775
02:00:56,740 --> 02:01:00,460
I think running for office and being open about the New World Order is a great way to

1776
02:01:00,460 --> 02:01:04,980
do it as well, just to educate people.

1777
02:01:04,980 --> 02:01:12,020
But knowing when to hold them, knowing when to fold them, when you're really trying to

1778
02:01:12,020 --> 02:01:15,980
get in and defeat the enemy, it's a complex issue.

1779
02:01:15,980 --> 02:01:21,060
Let's go to Brian in New Mexico, you're on the air, go ahead.

1780
02:01:21,060 --> 02:01:24,140
Thank you, Alex, for taking my call, and first of all, I want to wish you a Happy New Year

1781
02:01:24,140 --> 02:01:25,140
for your family.

1782
02:01:25,140 --> 02:01:27,900
You too, brother, God bless you.

1783
02:01:27,900 --> 02:01:32,460
My biggest concern, I think, is with the media.

1784
02:01:32,460 --> 02:01:37,300
There's a lot of evil and crookedness, people, you know, with their backroom deals and such.

1785
02:01:37,300 --> 02:01:43,660
But the media who knows it and perpetuates it and misguides people, I think is the key

1786
02:01:43,660 --> 02:01:50,620
problem that we're facing, not even the technical brainwave changing patterns of TV and such.

1787
02:01:50,620 --> 02:01:56,220
All the advertisements are there to make you feel fragmented, broken, weak, and if we don't

1788
02:01:56,220 --> 02:02:00,140
use the right toothpaste, we're not going to be able to do whatever, you know, we want

1789
02:02:00,140 --> 02:02:01,140
to do.

1790
02:02:01,140 --> 02:02:07,100
We are incredibly powerful beings, and yes, we are being drugged and manipulated in order

1791
02:02:07,100 --> 02:02:10,700
that we don't tap into our greatness and our power.

1792
02:02:10,700 --> 02:02:17,780
But even in the most drug-down, mentally deficient person, there is a spark that the globalists,

1793
02:02:17,780 --> 02:02:23,300
I think that's what they're ultimately afraid of, is a few thousand people have taken control

1794
02:02:23,300 --> 02:02:29,380
over the whole population of this planet, and they do it subconsciously.

1795
02:02:29,380 --> 02:02:33,640
They can't physically control us, at least not yet, so they do everything they can to

1796
02:02:33,640 --> 02:02:39,940
make us feel, you know, like we're worthless, but we are incredible beings.

1797
02:02:39,940 --> 02:02:45,580
Just last year, I've been producing a television show, a public access TV show here in Albuquerque,

1798
02:02:45,580 --> 02:02:49,220
and through backroom deals with the corrupt mayor and the city council, basically they

1799
02:02:49,220 --> 02:02:56,140
gave control to a for-profit group that is now censoring all live things, and they're

1800
02:02:56,140 --> 02:03:02,400
not allowing any controversial topics, so I'm basically out of a viewpoint, or an outlet

1801
02:03:02,400 --> 02:03:08,780
to express my viewpoint, but still just talking to people day-to-day, you never know how just

1802
02:03:08,780 --> 02:03:12,380
the simplest conversation will have huge ripples.

1803
02:03:12,380 --> 02:03:16,900
Going back to the gun thing, I was at the dog park, and some guy was saying, well, we

1804
02:03:16,900 --> 02:03:20,460
don't need guns, and he's going, brrr, you don't need that to hunt deer.

1805
02:03:20,460 --> 02:03:24,660
I said, first of all, you don't have a gun, or you would know that you can't hunt deer

1806
02:03:24,660 --> 02:03:28,980
with it, you can't get an automatic weapon, but they're in this mindset of what they see

1807
02:03:28,980 --> 02:03:34,940
on television, and really, I think the biggest thing that people need to do is get rid of

1808
02:03:34,940 --> 02:03:39,980
their television, or if they do watch it for research or whatever, know how they're being

1809
02:03:39,980 --> 02:03:46,300
manipulated, and really spend more time with your kids, talk radio, just more real life

1810
02:03:46,300 --> 02:03:47,980
things is what I think this population really needs.

1811
02:03:47,980 --> 02:03:53,180
Yeah, that's why they ain't talk radio, is that it's not scripted, especially shows like

1812
02:03:53,180 --> 02:04:00,380
this, but even mainline talk radio is not scripted compared to mainline globalist type

1813
02:04:00,380 --> 02:04:01,940
propaganda.

1814
02:04:01,940 --> 02:04:06,680
But all over the country, they're trying to shut down access TV, people should use it

1815
02:04:06,680 --> 02:04:09,820
while it's still there, people should defend it.

1816
02:04:09,820 --> 02:04:15,540
They tried hard to keep me off of it, it's a great way to reach locals and organize things,

1817
02:04:15,540 --> 02:04:20,300
but there's other ways, most AM and FM stations are begging for people that wanna come in

1818
02:04:20,300 --> 02:04:23,060
into an hour or two on the weekend.

1819
02:04:23,060 --> 02:04:30,140
So do a YouTube channel first to show that you can talk, and then use that to say, hey,

1820
02:04:30,140 --> 02:04:36,340
here's my local internet show, I do local news, and volunteer to come in and say, and

1821
02:04:36,340 --> 02:04:41,780
I'll try to get sponsors, and then you can be a salesman as well, just on spec.

1822
02:04:41,780 --> 02:04:47,900
And most stations, if you're well-spoken at all, will give you a weekend show, and then

1823
02:04:47,900 --> 02:04:51,300
you're reaching a lot of people, then you start telling folks about your show, you get

1824
02:04:51,300 --> 02:04:55,980
them tuning in, then there's a buzz, pretty soon you're filling in for the weekday show,

1825
02:04:55,980 --> 02:05:03,260
pretty soon you got your own weekday show, pretty soon you're syndicated, pretty soon.

1826
02:05:03,260 --> 02:05:09,580

The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.

1840
02:06:08,860 --> 02:06:14,900
The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce

1841
02:06:14,900 --> 02:06:15,900
to the global takeover.

other harmful pathogens.

hundred times the effectiveness of colloidal or ionic silver solutions.

whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial complex.

Dallas.

1876
02:08:24,180 --> 02:08:30,140
The first reports say that President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by this shooting.

1877
02:08:30,140 --> 02:08:38,260
It is a big idea, a new world order.

1878
02:08:38,260 --> 02:08:44,260
It was almost as if it were a planned implosion, it just pancakes.

1879
02:08:44,260 --> 02:09:01,220
Either you were with us or you were with the terrorists.

1880
02:09:01,220 --> 02:09:05,740
I also believe that a lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers

1881
02:09:05,740 --> 02:09:06,740
not in the hands of criminals.

1882
02:09:06,740 --> 02:09:15,060
Guns will be caked and no one will be able to be armed, we're going to take all of them.

1883
02:09:15,060 --> 02:09:19,420
For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American

1884
02:09:19,420 --> 02:09:20,420
city.

1885
02:09:20,420 --> 02:09:24,420
Global governance at last, is it one world the central bank is in charge, but aren't

1886
02:09:24,420 --> 02:09:28,020
we all just living and dying for what the central banks do?

1887
02:09:28,020 --> 02:09:34,060
And for me, give me liberty or give me death!

1888
02:09:34,060 --> 02:09:49,860
Ladies and gentlemen, I want to break down just a snapshot of the premeditated evil that

1889
02:09:49,860 --> 02:09:52,860
is Agenda 21 implemented.

1890
02:09:52,860 --> 02:10:03,020
And then we'll go to your phone calls continuing on this live first day of January 2013 transmission.

1891
02:10:03,020 --> 02:10:10,580
But I want to read a quote here of Oliver Wendell Holmes, a Supreme Court Justice, taxes

1892
02:10:10,580 --> 02:10:14,780
of the price we pay for civilization.

1893
02:10:14,780 --> 02:10:24,020
And that is what the collectivist will always put in your face when you come out and point

1894
02:10:24,020 --> 02:10:32,340
out that we are having our basic liberties and freedoms eradicated.

1895
02:10:32,340 --> 02:10:43,020
Here is another headline, Georgetown Law Professor, scrap, archaic, idiosyncratic and downright

1896
02:10:43,020 --> 02:10:46,540
evil, those are quotes, Constitution.

1897
02:10:46,540 --> 02:10:57,900
And that is a top Georgetown Law Professor in the New York Times saying that, Louis Michael

1898
02:10:57,900 --> 02:11:03,140
Seidman, and of course, a big Obama supporter.

1899
02:11:03,140 --> 02:11:11,180
We have other articles up at infullwars.com that are just snapshots into how all of this

1900
02:11:11,180 --> 02:11:12,180
works.

1901
02:11:12,180 --> 02:11:19,840
Here's one by Kurt Nemo, Democratic operatives crank up death panel talk following Obama

1902
02:11:19,840 --> 02:11:25,660
win and put out their twisted graphs showing how much US healthcare costs versus other

1903
02:11:25,660 --> 02:11:26,660
countries.

1904
02:11:26,660 --> 02:11:31,740
And when you go read the article by George Soros operative at Slate, their headline is

1905
02:11:31,740 --> 02:11:35,540
the case for death panels.

1906
02:11:35,540 --> 02:11:39,780
You hear the same talking point, the case for killing Granny.

1907
02:11:39,780 --> 02:11:55,340
And of course, we have the clip as well from people out there like the host of the HBO

1908
02:11:55,340 --> 02:12:01,420
show Bill Maher, where he says more death is what we need, get rid of more people.

1909
02:12:01,420 --> 02:12:05,460
But then he says turn your guns in for the poor 20 dead children.

1910
02:12:05,460 --> 02:12:11,660
They can selectively turn it on and selectively turn it off.

1911
02:12:11,660 --> 02:12:13,420
This is all agenda 21.

1912
02:12:13,420 --> 02:12:19,860
Let me explain how collectivism has worked in every country and why the true robber baron

1913
02:12:19,860 --> 02:12:27,100
elites in the last 150 years or so have put their full weight behind it.

1914
02:12:27,100 --> 02:12:34,660
A, it makes people dependent, B, the globalist always exempt themselves internationally from

1915
02:12:34,660 --> 02:12:37,940
the laws they put on people in subsectors.

1916
02:12:37,940 --> 02:12:49,100
What national sovereignty they allow to continue, they play off against the other nation states.

1917
02:12:49,100 --> 02:12:59,460
And in the White House Science Czar's book, Ecoscience, you can read it online, it's free,

1918
02:12:59,460 --> 02:13:02,140
close to 1,000 pages long.

1919
02:13:02,140 --> 02:13:18,620
And in all of their other publications, they openly talk about how they're going to set

1920
02:13:18,620 --> 02:13:23,420
up a government control system to make you dependent on government.

1921
02:13:23,420 --> 02:13:28,980
And to quote, have a police state like China, that's Dr. Bianca at UT who calls for 90%

1922
02:13:28,980 --> 02:13:34,500
of us to be exterminated by an airborne release of weaponized airborne Ebola.

1923
02:13:34,500 --> 02:13:37,260
They all say the same thing.

1924
02:13:37,260 --> 02:13:41,860
In fact, guys, I don't see it over there on the bookshelf, Ecoscience is a big giant white

1925
02:13:41,860 --> 02:13:42,860
book.

1926
02:13:42,860 --> 02:13:44,140
It's always been over there.

1927
02:13:44,140 --> 02:13:45,140
You guys go see what's there.

1928
02:13:45,140 --> 02:13:48,940
I think Aaron's here today, if not, go back and get it, cuz the reason I'm staring is

1929
02:13:48,940 --> 02:13:51,580
I'm wondering where's my book?

1930
02:13:51,580 --> 02:13:52,580
It's always been over there.

1931
02:13:52,580 --> 02:13:56,420
You guys can walk in front of the cameras, I don't care, I just don't see it.

1932
02:13:56,420 --> 02:13:59,980
Very hard to get a physical copy of that nowadays.

1933
02:13:59,980 --> 02:14:09,920
The point is, ladies and gentlemen, is this is a fact we're talking about.

1934
02:14:09,920 --> 02:14:17,700
And Agenda 21 has to be dealt with because it is a system of turning off the society.

1935
02:14:17,700 --> 02:14:25,260
What do you do when the civilization and the government is a purely predatory group?

1936
02:14:25,260 --> 02:14:29,860
And that's the norm throughout history, who have taken tyranny and codified it into a

1937
02:14:29,860 --> 02:14:36,900
political system where they, with scientific expertise through insurance models and other

1938
02:14:36,900 --> 02:14:48,340
systems, go after you and even actuary out the implosion of the society in orchestrated

1939
02:14:48,340 --> 02:14:50,940
systems.

1940
02:14:50,940 --> 02:14:54,540
Thank you, they found it, it was under my desk.

1941
02:14:54,540 --> 02:15:00,980
We did a video breakdown on this with Webster Tarpley, where he called the views in this

1942
02:15:00,980 --> 02:15:08,220
book ultra-Hitlerian, titled what the elites master plan for global extermination.

1943
02:15:08,220 --> 02:15:11,420
It's free online, it's an emergency SOS to everyone.

1944
02:15:11,420 --> 02:15:15,940
And here's the problem, we have over 100 books, we ought to do a review of these books sometime

1945
02:15:15,940 --> 02:15:20,420
over an hour just reading quotes, where it's all the same thing basically plagiarized and

1946
02:15:20,420 --> 02:15:21,780
repeated over and over again.

1947
02:15:21,780 --> 02:15:27,260
I don't know who plagiarized too, but sometimes it's word for word.

1948
02:15:27,260 --> 02:15:30,700
It's kind of like the Bible, there's a hundred different versions, but a lot of it's pretty

1949
02:15:30,700 --> 02:15:31,700
much the same.

1950
02:15:31,700 --> 02:15:34,220
I mean, it's amazing.

1951
02:15:34,220 --> 02:15:44,560
And they set themselves up as the saviors of the world in the name of tyranny.

1952
02:15:44,560 --> 02:15:48,060
They're the saviors of the world, and now they're gonna kill you, they're gonna dumb

1953
02:15:48,060 --> 02:15:50,060
you down, they're gonna cut off your resources.

1954
02:15:50,060 --> 02:15:55,540
When really it's the parasitic establishment saying, France will now go without lights

1955
02:15:55,540 --> 02:15:58,660
at night because everything's collapsing.

1956
02:15:58,660 --> 02:16:02,540
They're gonna turn the lights off in Australia at night.

1957
02:16:02,540 --> 02:16:07,300
Major cities in the US aren't gonna have lights and your smart meters are gonna charge you

1958
02:16:07,300 --> 02:16:11,300
more during the day for electricity.

1959
02:16:11,300 --> 02:16:17,460
And then you go read their own books, they say, we use too much energy, we need to make

1960
02:16:17,460 --> 02:16:20,880
people more frugal.

1961
02:16:20,880 --> 02:16:26,860
It's altruistic to be poor, it's beautiful to live under austerity, you go to Whole Foods

1962
02:16:26,860 --> 02:16:31,720
and half the magazines say it, how sexy it is to be poor.

1963
02:16:31,720 --> 02:16:36,740
And it's not being sold to make you get back to the earth and actually be self-sufficient,

1964
02:16:36,740 --> 02:16:37,740
that's one thing.

1965
02:16:37,740 --> 02:16:38,740
No, it's the opposite.

1966
02:16:38,740 --> 02:16:42,660
They put everything in to make you where you can't be self-sufficient, but then come and

1967
02:16:42,660 --> 02:16:44,720
cut your resources off.

1968
02:16:44,720 --> 02:16:49,100
And then say you're gonna work even harder in a 250 square foot apartment with your whole

1969
02:16:49,100 --> 02:16:55,940
family to where you can't take care of yourself even though you have two jobs, so you get

1970
02:16:55,940 --> 02:17:03,140
a supplemental government card with big robotic farming and manufacturing operations with

1971
02:17:03,140 --> 02:17:06,240
robots giving you goods you need to survive.

1972
02:17:06,240 --> 02:17:13,700
This is the plan, show that you're forced to take inoculations, I mean, they say in

1973
02:17:13,700 --> 02:17:17,540
all their publications that they're going to put all of us that don't take the shots

1974
02:17:17,540 --> 02:17:20,420
and don't do this in ghettos.

1975
02:17:20,420 --> 02:17:26,580
And then just like Malthus wrote 200 and something years ago, they're going to pump pathogens

1976
02:17:26,580 --> 02:17:29,220
in to kill us in the ghettos.

1977
02:17:29,220 --> 02:17:35,380
They say we're gonna put you in ghettos if you won't go along with all this and then

1978
02:17:35,380 --> 02:17:39,540
there's gonna be some outbreaks and then you actually read deeper they go we're gonna release

1979
02:17:39,540 --> 02:17:40,540
it on you.

1980
02:17:40,540 --> 02:17:45,340
I mean, this is a nightmare where they're hunting us and that's what happens in corrupt

1981
02:17:45,340 --> 02:17:50,700
psychopathic civilizations is that corrupt elites get into control who are ruthless and

1982
02:17:50,700 --> 02:17:55,700
they make a sport and a game out of incrementally shutting down the society.

1983
02:17:55,700 --> 02:18:00,780
But they take their time cuz they enjoy their work, but also so that you never struggle

1984
02:18:00,780 --> 02:18:03,300
out of the net.

1985
02:18:03,300 --> 02:18:08,020
And they're openly now saying if the IRS run by foreign banks says you haven't paid your

1986
02:18:08,020 --> 02:18:13,300
taxes, no judge, no jury, no due process, your car is not gonna start.

1987
02:18:13,300 --> 02:18:16,540
All the new cars with kill switches built into them electronically is basically a cell

1988
02:18:16,540 --> 02:18:20,220
phone component, all the new cars.

1989
02:18:20,220 --> 02:18:24,380
Not just the black boxes in them, but other kill switches that's on record.

1990
02:18:24,380 --> 02:18:28,420
All printers, they have a record of when you bought it, who you were, they just turned

1991
02:18:28,420 --> 02:18:29,420
them off.

1992
02:18:29,420 --> 02:18:33,020
Your printer will turn off, your computer will stop working, you're gonna be face scanned

1993
02:18:33,020 --> 02:18:34,060
off the cameras.

1994
02:18:34,060 --> 02:18:39,820
The computer won't turn on unless the camera is uncovered and unless the face scan authenticates

1995
02:18:39,820 --> 02:18:40,900
when you turn it on.

1996
02:18:40,900 --> 02:18:45,380
If you try to go to the store to buy food, even with cash, cash will still be there.

1997
02:18:45,380 --> 02:18:49,740
It's just the face scan instant, this is already going in everywhere, by the way, told you

1998
02:18:49,740 --> 02:18:53,840
this 15 years ago because MIT said it was the Pentagon plan for total control.

1999
02:18:53,840 --> 02:18:58,060
Now it's in, remember all that'll never happen, that's fair mongering.

2000
02:18:58,060 --> 02:19:02,980
Face scanning to go to college, forced inoculations to go to college, no law, they just make you

2001
02:19:02,980 --> 02:19:03,980
do it.

2002
02:19:03,980 --> 02:19:06,120
They say it's policy.

2003
02:19:06,120 --> 02:19:15,620
Total control and then lots of mindless entertainment and peer pressure dumbing people down while

2004
02:19:15,620 --> 02:19:20,020
your neighbors are dying of cancer and your kids brain damage from shots.

2005
02:19:20,020 --> 02:19:23,480
And you've got all these health problems even though you supposedly eat healthy and exercise

2006
02:19:23,480 --> 02:19:26,540
all the time and everybody's got asthma and allergies.

2007
02:19:26,540 --> 02:19:31,940
And the cancer rates gone up almost 3,000% for adults, it goes up 10,000% like it already

2008
02:19:31,940 --> 02:19:34,220
is for kids and nobody asked why it's happening.

2009
02:19:34,220 --> 02:19:36,900
And they all talk about how they're going to kill us with the cancer and how they put

2010
02:19:36,900 --> 02:19:37,900
the stuff in the water.

2011
02:19:37,900 --> 02:19:42,640
And you sit here and read stuff they wrote in the 70s and it's happening now.

2012
02:19:42,640 --> 02:19:46,020
And you're like, hey, you go up to the cops and say, hey, don't you want to fight the

2013
02:19:46,020 --> 02:19:47,020
new war?

2014
02:19:47,020 --> 02:19:48,020
They're like, I got a uniform, I feel powerful.

2015
02:19:48,020 --> 02:19:50,740
I'm like, do you have any kids at home that are retarded?

2016
02:19:50,740 --> 02:19:52,940
Well, yeah, actually I do.

2017
02:19:52,940 --> 02:19:56,620
Do you know they did that to you, chances are, I really don't care.

2018
02:19:56,620 --> 02:20:01,300
See, it's learning how to love your own destruction, Saul.

2019
02:20:01,300 --> 02:20:04,300
You know what happens to your digestive health around the holidays?

2020
02:20:04,300 --> 02:20:05,300
Right.

2021
02:20:05,300 --> 02:20:09,620

Terriganix, life's getting better.

2034
02:21:00,420 --> 02:21:01,980
Hi there.

2035
02:21:01,980 --> 02:21:02,980
My name is Frank Bates.

2036
02:21:02,980 --> 02:21:07,220
What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble.

2037
02:21:07,220 --> 02:21:13,500
I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity

2038
02:21:13,500 --> 02:21:18,220
monopolies and government agencies for what they really are, incompetent line crooks that

2039
02:21:18,220 --> 02:21:23,340
are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high.

2040
02:21:23,340 --> 02:21:25,460
Some have called this a conspiracy.

2041
02:21:25,460 --> 02:21:30,180
Others have called it a cover-up and you will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy

2042
02:21:30,180 --> 02:21:31,260
goes.

2043
02:21:31,260 --> 02:21:36,900
My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them

2044
02:21:36,900 --> 02:21:39,340
and how you can beat them too.

2045
02:21:39,340 --> 02:21:43,220
Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patrons have already seen in

2046
02:21:43,220 --> 02:21:44,220
the last three months.

2047
02:21:44,220 --> 02:21:50,180
Go to 123coverup.com and discover one weird trick to slash your power bill and protect

2048
02:21:50,180 --> 02:21:51,180
your home.

2049
02:21:51,180 --> 02:21:57,260
Go watch my video now at 123coverup.com before they force me to shut it down.

2050
02:21:57,260 --> 02:21:59,260
Again, that's 123coverup.com.

2051
02:21:59,260 --> 02:22:04,340
Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the bestselling book, Cancer Step Outside the

2052
02:22:04,340 --> 02:22:05,340
Box.

2053
02:22:05,340 --> 02:22:08,260
I want you to know some very important information.

2054
02:22:08,260 --> 02:22:13,060
In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White

2055
02:22:13,060 --> 02:22:17,380
House at a time when only the president could obtain this world-class healer.

2056
02:22:17,380 --> 02:22:22,940
Now 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.

2057
02:22:22,940 --> 02:22:28,020
Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally

2058
02:22:28,020 --> 02:22:33,160
occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single

2059
02:22:33,160 --> 02:22:34,300
normal cell.

2060
02:22:34,300 --> 02:22:38,060
If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune

2061
02:22:38,060 --> 02:22:42,060
cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.

2063

That's 1-866-836-8735, 1-866-VENUSFLY or visit Carnivora.com.

2064
02:22:57,380 --> 02:23:00,140
Protect your immune system, it's the only one you've got.

2065
02:23:00,140 --> 02:23:05,300
Quantitative easing, unemployment at depression levels, Europe financial system falling apart,

2066
02:23:05,300 --> 02:23:07,400
China getting out of U.S. Treasuries.

2067
02:23:07,400 --> 02:23:12,420
At the end of 2008, the time of TARP, the national debt was at 11 trillion gold trading

2068
02:23:12,420 --> 02:23:14,900
around $850 per ounce.

2069
02:23:14,900 --> 02:23:21,420
Close to 2012, the national debt exceeded 16.4 trillion, gold doubled to $1600 per ounce.

2070
02:23:21,420 --> 02:23:24,660
The 20 trillion threshold for the national debt is inevitable.

2071
02:23:24,660 --> 02:23:28,900
Politicians in Washington have a ferocious appetite for spending and stimulus.

2072
02:23:28,900 --> 02:23:31,140
What's worse, a printing press to finance.

2073
02:23:31,140 --> 02:23:36,020
100 years ago, we had a gold standard to limit this madness, but now you have to adopt your

2074
02:23:36,020 --> 02:23:37,380
own gold standard.

2075
02:23:37,380 --> 02:23:39,140
Don't be fooled with paper promises.

2076
02:23:39,140 --> 02:23:45,580

2078

the next economic crisis.

2081
02:24:14,140 --> 02:24:19,740
You know a lot of people see videos produced in partnership with the British government,

2082
02:24:19,740 --> 02:24:25,580
the UK government, for plannedopolis and it's where everybody lives in the ghettos that

2083
02:24:25,580 --> 02:24:27,220
won't accept total control.

2084
02:24:27,220 --> 02:24:29,740
Everybody else is controlled by central computers.

2085
02:24:29,740 --> 02:24:33,680
Nobody's allowed to have cars but the elites.

2086
02:24:33,680 --> 02:24:37,380
And people would see these videos and think it was a joke.

2087
02:24:37,380 --> 02:24:41,100
But this is what they really plan.

2088
02:24:41,100 --> 02:24:46,300
And when you've got over 100 books written by top globalist, talking about how they're

2089
02:24:46,300 --> 02:24:52,420
soft killing us, and talking about how once they get us in the compact cities, they can

2090
02:24:52,420 --> 02:24:57,980
then wipe out the third world, the people in the compact cities will then beg the government

2091
02:24:57,980 --> 02:25:01,820
to give them even more control.

2092
02:25:01,820 --> 02:25:06,820
And then they're planning to wipe out the people in the mega cities.

2093
02:25:06,820 --> 02:25:12,460
And they sit there and they brag about all this and you're sitting there reading psychopaths

2094
02:25:12,460 --> 02:25:17,940
telling you what they're gonna do, in many cases not even veiled.

2095
02:25:17,940 --> 02:25:22,740
And then you go out to the public and you go, hey, Europe's got death panels.

2096
02:25:22,740 --> 02:25:24,020
And people go, that doesn't exist.

2097
02:25:24,020 --> 02:25:25,020
I heard you're a liar.

2098
02:25:25,020 --> 02:25:27,860
You're like, no, let me show you a video clip or let me show you their own book.

2099
02:25:27,860 --> 02:25:29,940
No, I don't believe that crazy.

2100
02:25:29,940 --> 02:25:32,940
Now that they get healthcare in, government healthcare, they're like, yeah, of course

2101
02:25:32,940 --> 02:25:34,980
there's death panels.

2102
02:25:34,980 --> 02:25:42,700
And here's how the trap of collectivism works to get you into this system, okay?

2103
02:25:42,700 --> 02:25:46,060
I was just looking at plannedopolis where the government decides the route of where

2104
02:25:46,060 --> 02:25:48,740
you're gonna go to allow you to leave your house.

2105
02:25:48,740 --> 02:25:51,900
You have to get the computer to authorize it, that it's been approved.

2106
02:25:51,900 --> 02:25:57,180
I mean, this is how totally sick these people are.

2107
02:25:57,180 --> 02:26:02,340
And again, they think you're so rudderless now that they put out classic authoritarianism

2108
02:26:02,340 --> 02:26:06,420
with a high-tech icing as if it's a good thing.

2109
02:26:06,420 --> 02:26:08,340
But here's how collectivism works.

2110
02:26:08,340 --> 02:26:11,900
They say, okay, everybody pays for everybody else's healthcare now.

2111
02:26:11,900 --> 02:26:15,660
So healthcare costs are too high, cuz when you put government money into something it

2112
02:26:15,660 --> 02:26:17,300
drives up the price.

2113
02:26:17,300 --> 02:26:23,260
And so we're gonna say what you can eat and how much you've gotta exercise and that you

2114
02:26:23,260 --> 02:26:27,860
can only eat meat once a year, which they're openly announcing under the UN World Food

2115
02:26:27,860 --> 02:26:28,860
Council.

2116
02:26:28,860 --> 02:26:31,620
I'm showing their UN video right now on screen for TV viewers.

2117
02:26:31,620 --> 02:26:35,540
I mean, you cannot make this up.

2118
02:26:35,540 --> 02:26:39,220
It's just unbelievable, folks, to see how dumbed down the public is.

2119
02:26:39,220 --> 02:26:41,900
They have no idea how much trouble they're in.

2120
02:26:41,900 --> 02:26:47,940
They're already jacking the food, the water, everything, and bragging about it.

2121
02:26:47,940 --> 02:26:51,540
And the trap works that once they say, well, things are collectivized, well, I'm paying

2122
02:26:51,540 --> 02:26:54,380
for it, so I say how much you're gonna weigh.

2123
02:26:54,380 --> 02:26:59,660
And they use an example of a 700-pound woman on welfare and say there ought to be rules.

2124
02:26:59,660 --> 02:27:06,420
But then you find the rules, say 860 calories for breakfast and lunch, and then another

2125
02:27:06,420 --> 02:27:08,940
500 for dinner, which is basically starvation level.

2126
02:27:08,940 --> 02:27:12,660
And if you're 1% above their fat index, the state takes your kids.

2127
02:27:12,660 --> 02:27:17,240
I mean, you read what they're gonna push, it's unbelievable.

2128
02:27:17,240 --> 02:27:20,980
And parents can't pack school lunches, and that's already rolling out.

2129
02:27:20,980 --> 02:27:24,740
I mean, just three years ago, I was reporting on them not letting people pack their own

2130
02:27:24,740 --> 02:27:26,520
lunches in Chicago and other areas.

2131
02:27:26,520 --> 02:27:28,420
People didn't believe me, and now it's going in everywhere.

2132
02:27:28,420 --> 02:27:32,540
I remember 15 years ago reporting on them banning dodgeball, people didn't believe it.

2133
02:27:32,540 --> 02:27:35,620
Now schools everywhere don't even let you run at recess.

2134
02:27:35,620 --> 02:27:38,580
It's total prison control.

2135
02:27:38,580 --> 02:27:43,940
And so now, and I've got articles breaking this down, they come out in all these George

2136
02:27:43,940 --> 02:27:50,380
Soros-connected outfits like Slate and have their operatives, in this one case, say the

2137
02:27:50,380 --> 02:27:52,580
case for death panels in one chart.

2138
02:27:52,580 --> 02:27:54,980
You guys punch this up on screen.

2139
02:27:54,980 --> 02:28:00,740
And it shows a skewed and manipulated chart to begin with, because they're showing end-of-life

2140
02:28:00,740 --> 02:28:06,820
care, specifically not overall healthcare, percentage of GDP.

2141
02:28:06,820 --> 02:28:10,780
And they don't have family in healthcare, they haven't researched it.

2142
02:28:10,780 --> 02:28:13,460
They're here deceiving people.

2143
02:28:13,460 --> 02:28:17,780
And it's the same line Bill Gates puts out that will play after the break where he says,

2144
02:28:17,780 --> 02:28:21,580
kill granny, hire ten teachers.

2145
02:28:21,580 --> 02:28:25,420
They don't explain to you that the insurance companies owned by foreign banks have set

2146
02:28:25,420 --> 02:28:30,860
this up, that when you've got insurance, it's three to four to five times more than if you

2147
02:28:30,860 --> 02:28:33,020
didn't have insurance, depending on the hospital.

2148
02:28:33,020 --> 02:28:35,780
Sometimes if you don't, it's three or four or five times more.

2149
02:28:35,780 --> 02:28:37,660
You see, it's all a scam.

2150
02:28:37,660 --> 02:28:44,380
I had a friend's mom get bit by a rattlesnake on Town Lake here in Austin, on the edge of

2151
02:28:44,380 --> 02:28:47,000
Town Lake.

2152
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:54,140
And because they had top of the line insurance, and because they knew that they were wealthy,

2153
02:28:54,140 --> 02:28:56,580
they charged them $300,000.

2154
02:28:56,580 --> 02:29:00,700
They negotiated it down, I think they said $170,000.

2155
02:29:00,700 --> 02:29:03,340
And she went to the hospital, didn't have a problem, gave them antivenom that costs

2156
02:29:03,340 --> 02:29:05,060
like $50.

2157
02:29:05,060 --> 02:29:09,380
But because they didn't negotiate it, they tried to charge them $300,000 because they

2158
02:29:09,380 --> 02:29:13,380
had top of the line insurance and were worth just buku money.

2159
02:29:13,380 --> 02:29:15,660
That's how this stuff operates.

2160
02:29:15,660 --> 02:29:19,980
I have insurance, my fingers cut off, I go to the hospital, illegal aliens are going

2161
02:29:19,980 --> 02:29:23,300
in front of me for an hour.

2162
02:29:23,300 --> 02:29:27,500
No insurance, no nothing, not even checking their names, your God, your God, your God,

2163
02:29:27,500 --> 02:29:29,180
you're here to bankrupt the system.

2164
02:29:29,180 --> 02:29:32,260
You want to come and have a free baby, boom, it's paid for.

2165
02:29:32,260 --> 02:29:36,820
But citizens, you can't get healthcare even when you have the insurance, and that's how

2166
02:29:36,820 --> 02:29:37,920
it is in England.

2167
02:29:37,920 --> 02:29:42,300
I've watched the C-SPAN debates in British Parliament, where you wait 18 months for an

2168
02:29:42,300 --> 02:29:50,580
operable brain tumor that isn't operable in one year, stay with us.

2169
02:29:50,580 --> 02:30:01,580
We're on the march, the empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

2170
02:30:01,580 --> 02:30:02,580
It's me.

2171
02:30:02,580 --> 02:30:06,220
Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as

2172
02:30:06,220 --> 02:30:07,780
you get sick and die?

2173
02:30:07,780 --> 02:30:09,980
Start purifying your water with ProPure.

2174
02:30:09,980 --> 02:30:14,540
My friends, I've done a lot of research, and the best gravity filter out there bar none

2175
02:30:14,540 --> 02:30:19,120
is ProPure, and it's available discounted at infowars.com.

2176
02:30:19,120 --> 02:30:22,580
Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.

2177
02:30:22,580 --> 02:30:24,260
There's no priming required.

2178
02:30:24,260 --> 02:30:30,620
It's NSF 42 certified, optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%, easy to set

2179
02:30:30,620 --> 02:30:36,260
up and use, doesn't require electricity, purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.

2180
02:30:36,260 --> 02:30:39,660
This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.

2181
02:30:39,660 --> 02:30:43,780
Save money by not buying bottled water and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.

2182
02:30:43,780 --> 02:30:46,460
ProPure is the best gravity fed filter out there.

2183
02:30:46,460 --> 02:30:48,460
It's what my family uses.

2184
02:30:48,460 --> 02:30:52,740

There's a need for a new world order, but it has different characteristics in different

2207
02:33:10,980 --> 02:33:15,460
parts of the world.

2208
02:33:15,460 --> 02:33:24,480
Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.

2209
02:33:24,480 --> 02:33:28,380
So you've got these poor people out there, US citizens, they can be Hispanic, black,

2210
02:33:28,380 --> 02:33:30,740
white, you name it.

2211
02:33:30,740 --> 02:33:34,920
They don't know under the Hippocratic Oath and the entire history of Western medicine

2212
02:33:34,920 --> 02:33:42,980
that a third of the healthcare a doctor provides as an honorable profession was to be free.

2213
02:33:42,980 --> 02:33:44,800
Free.

2214
02:33:44,800 --> 02:33:48,860
And then the wealthy were supposed to give endowment and money to tax-free hospitals.

2215
02:33:48,860 --> 02:33:51,380
This is just a window into agenda 21.

2216
02:33:51,380 --> 02:33:54,900
The Rockefellers by the 20s start taking over medicine.

2217
02:33:54,900 --> 02:33:59,380
They are the biggest owners and controllers in their tax-free foundations of the charity

2218
02:33:59,380 --> 02:34:00,380
hospitals.

2219
02:34:00,380 --> 02:34:03,620
They don't tell you it's charity hospital when you go in it.

2220
02:34:03,620 --> 02:34:08,440
So they're tax-exempt, but they run a money-making operation.

2221
02:34:08,440 --> 02:34:12,940
And we had a crew member, he was a contractor for me six, seven years ago, probably gonna

2222
02:34:12,940 --> 02:34:14,260
die of Crohn's disease.

2223
02:34:14,260 --> 02:34:17,780
He'd been kicked off insurance, couldn't even get it.

2224
02:34:17,780 --> 02:34:18,900
And I had to argue with him.

2225
02:34:18,900 --> 02:34:23,020
I said, I know you've been to 10 hospitals, 15 doctors.

2226
02:34:23,020 --> 02:34:27,500
You're losing weight, basically go home and maybe die.

2227
02:34:27,500 --> 02:34:33,500
I said, listen, I know that you have to go in and explain and show them your financials

2228
02:34:33,500 --> 02:34:35,380
that you can't get insurance.

2229
02:34:35,380 --> 02:34:36,380
And there's charity care.

2230
02:34:36,380 --> 02:34:39,660
He said, I don't believe you that I've gone in and told them this and they tell me it

2231
02:34:39,660 --> 02:34:40,660
doesn't exist.

2232
02:34:40,660 --> 02:34:43,740
And I said, listen, you gotta keep doing it.

2233
02:34:43,740 --> 02:34:46,920
And I was just talking to CJ out there about years ago.

2234
02:34:46,920 --> 02:34:51,460
He looked into this to help somebody he knew for charity care with dental stuff.

2235
02:34:51,460 --> 02:34:57,100
And by the way, my dad manages 18 dental offices, okay, I happen to know about this.

2236
02:34:57,100 --> 02:35:02,300
And now these big conglomerates will tell the dentists, don't tell people about this.

2237
02:35:02,300 --> 02:35:08,520
They don't do the Hippocratic oath anymore for about 20 years, do no harm, Hippocrates.

2238
02:35:08,520 --> 02:35:12,260
So under Obamacare, they're getting rid of charity care.

2239
02:35:12,260 --> 02:35:15,160
And they're making everybody go buy insurance even if we can't afford it.

2240
02:35:15,160 --> 02:35:20,960
And now it's gonna double the premiums this year, that's Bloomberg and AP reporting that.

2241
02:35:20,960 --> 02:35:25,700
And then it lets the government control what health care you get through the death panels.

2242
02:35:25,700 --> 02:35:29,500
And they use an example of an old lady who's gonna get a million dollars of care, and that's

2243
02:35:29,500 --> 02:35:34,900
all jacked up in a bad example, a cherry picked example, to say you're gonna lose your job

2244
02:35:34,900 --> 02:35:37,500
as a teacher now cuz she's gonna get health care.

2245
02:35:37,500 --> 02:35:41,740
Well, see next, you're gonna lose your job if we give this 65-year-old person an eye

2246
02:35:41,740 --> 02:35:43,540
surgery.

2247
02:35:43,540 --> 02:35:49,360
And it's all this idea of the pie is one size, cuz the globalists say within just ten years,

2248
02:35:49,360 --> 02:35:55,660
they already have this, they'll have robot machines that for $100 can sit there and give

2249
02:35:55,660 --> 02:35:59,080
you an eye surgery to correct your vision.

2250
02:35:59,080 --> 02:36:01,260
Life extension is gonna be totally cheap.

2251
02:36:01,260 --> 02:36:06,100
They've gotta bring us back into a dark age for the general population, except for what

2252
02:36:06,100 --> 02:36:12,760
they call megacity or city-state reservations, high-tech reservations.

2253
02:36:12,760 --> 02:36:13,760
This is now being announced.

2254
02:36:13,760 --> 02:36:16,860
People are like, how did you know this 15 years ago?

2255
02:36:16,860 --> 02:36:20,860
They wrote books about it, non-fiction.

2256
02:36:20,860 --> 02:36:21,860
It's all planned.

2257
02:36:21,860 --> 02:36:25,060
I don't know how else to explain this to you.

2258
02:36:25,060 --> 02:36:29,060
And you've got these fools waddling around going, I want my old on the phone, I want

2259
02:36:29,060 --> 02:36:31,560
my free health care.

2260
02:36:31,560 --> 02:36:37,460
And I was just talking to CJ about how, yeah, he found in Austin, the only places that advertise

2261
02:36:37,460 --> 02:36:39,620
charity care were in Spanish.

2262
02:36:39,620 --> 02:36:44,780
And they're getting endowment money, they're getting government grants, taxpayer money.

2263
02:36:44,780 --> 02:36:46,420
It's not supposed to run like that.

2264
02:36:46,420 --> 02:36:49,740
You got a hospital that has regular care, regular prices.

2265
02:36:49,740 --> 02:36:52,660
They look at how much you make, and it goes on a scale.

2266
02:36:52,660 --> 02:36:56,640
And then the doctors, like Ron Paul did for a decade, he would go two nights a week and

2267
02:36:56,640 --> 02:37:01,140
work at the poor hospital for $2 a night.

2268
02:37:01,140 --> 02:37:05,860
And that was customary, cuz that would pay for your food and gas, because he was a real

2269
02:37:05,860 --> 02:37:06,860
servant.

2270
02:37:06,860 --> 02:37:11,940
He got into it under the Hippocratic oath that you were taught as a physician, you're

2271
02:37:11,940 --> 02:37:18,760
doing this to serve people the highest calling, to wash people's feet.

2272
02:37:18,760 --> 02:37:21,280
It was Christian, ladies and gentlemen.

2273
02:37:21,280 --> 02:37:26,940
It was Christian, the first hospitals were the hospitallers, Christian sect.

2274
02:37:26,940 --> 02:37:34,440
Before, just go die, or go to the local medicine woman.

2275
02:37:34,440 --> 02:37:42,540
And so that's the issue, is that you are meant to provide the care.

2276
02:37:42,540 --> 02:37:48,160
You are meant to, let's say if you're having to get people crowns and stuff, you're supposed

2277
02:37:48,160 --> 02:37:51,540
to call up companies and go, we'll give you all our business for crowns.

2278
02:37:51,540 --> 02:37:57,640
But are you gonna provide us a certain percentage of free stuff so we can give it to the poor?

2279
02:37:57,640 --> 02:38:01,500
She used to, everybody just did that, understanding it's what you had to do.

2280
02:38:01,500 --> 02:38:03,900
Now that's all gone, churches are gone.

2281
02:38:03,900 --> 02:38:07,460
They're now 501c3, it's all gone.

2282
02:38:07,460 --> 02:38:13,460
So again, they come out and say, taxes are what you pay to have a civilization.

2283
02:38:13,460 --> 02:38:15,020
That's actually not true.

2284
02:38:15,020 --> 02:38:19,780
Local taxes are what you do, you locally agree on some taxes if there's a big problem, a

2285
02:38:19,780 --> 02:38:20,780
special problem.

2286
02:38:20,780 --> 02:38:26,460
Or hey, we wanna build dikes to expand our shipping area, like the Dutch, and then locally

2287
02:38:26,460 --> 02:38:28,900
you vote and you pay to do it.

2288
02:38:28,900 --> 02:38:36,600
And then those jobs get paid locally to merchants and for people to expand the building of it.

2289
02:38:36,600 --> 02:38:39,100
But globalism is everything to these development zones.

2290
02:38:39,100 --> 02:38:43,980
I mean, they all wrote books about it, Rollerball, James Caan in the 70s, there's a fiction movie

2291
02:38:43,980 --> 02:38:52,300
about this where you've got Energy City, Manufacturing City, Computer City, Military City, all corporate

2292
02:38:52,300 --> 02:38:57,600
cities run by the same guys where the corporate super elite land in these jet copters and

2293
02:38:57,600 --> 02:39:02,660
they want the top Rollerball world champion's wife.

2294
02:39:02,660 --> 02:39:03,660
And why?

2295
02:39:03,660 --> 02:39:07,220
Because they're jealous of him and it's an exercise of power.

2296
02:39:07,220 --> 02:39:12,540
This actually happened in Rome and other cultures, they would come to the top, sports heroes,

2297
02:39:12,540 --> 02:39:15,900
you name it, say, I want your wife, and you had to give it to them.

2298
02:39:15,900 --> 02:39:20,400
Folks, this stuff happens over and over and over again.

2299
02:39:20,400 --> 02:39:26,940
What Prema Noctu, where they would in the Middle Ages come and demand your wife on the

2300
02:39:26,940 --> 02:39:29,460
wedding night.

2301
02:39:29,460 --> 02:39:33,860
This stuff has happened, that's what the TSA down your pants, all of it is an exact historical

2302
02:39:33,860 --> 02:39:36,580
blueprint with a high tech overlay.

2303
02:39:36,580 --> 02:39:40,360
And so they get you into the cities, they do all this, and look at this commenter in

2304
02:39:40,360 --> 02:39:45,740
our article, Democrats crank up death panel talk following Obama win.

2305
02:39:45,740 --> 02:39:50,140
And I'm gonna play this clip here in a minute, but look at this commenter, he was commenter

2306
02:39:50,140 --> 02:39:54,580
number 30, printed this this morning, it's a lot more comments now.

2307
02:39:54,580 --> 02:39:59,140
I have to agree with Bill Gates on this one, the American people cannot afford to spend

2308
02:39:59,140 --> 02:40:05,060
1 million to keep a terminally ill patient alive in their later years.

2309
02:40:05,060 --> 02:40:10,740
Someone who is 80 years old has lived a long life, and they also say kill babies up to

2310
02:40:10,740 --> 02:40:11,940
age three now.

2311
02:40:11,940 --> 02:40:15,420
We cannot print money forever, and music will stop sometimes.

2312
02:40:15,420 --> 02:40:21,540
The analogy of laying off teachers is a good one, because we need to focus on the children

2313
02:40:21,540 --> 02:40:24,060
which are the only hope that we have for the future.

2314
02:40:24,060 --> 02:40:30,180
Man, that is a classic eugenic statement, that is carousel Logan's run, my mother's

2315
02:40:30,180 --> 02:40:33,020
in that movie, by the way.

2316
02:40:33,020 --> 02:40:39,100
The point is, is that she never tried to be in a movie, one of her friends was going to

2317
02:40:39,100 --> 02:40:43,260
be in Logan's run and she's in it a couple times, find those clips and play, it's pretty

2318
02:40:43,260 --> 02:40:44,260
interesting.

2319
02:40:44,260 --> 02:40:48,180
The point is, is that when you hit 30, they kill you, they send you up in a gladiatorial

2320
02:40:48,180 --> 02:40:53,500
event, a laser beam blows you to bits.

2321
02:40:53,500 --> 02:40:59,220
All these things are in your face, Zardosh, where there's an elite that lives forever

2322
02:40:59,220 --> 02:41:01,060
with high technology.

2323
02:41:01,060 --> 02:41:09,100
And they have compact megacities where they then send out hunter killer drones to go out

2324
02:41:09,100 --> 02:41:12,660
and kill the wild humans so their populations don't go up too high.

2325
02:41:12,660 --> 02:41:15,220
I think you heard that, it's called Hunger Games.

2326
02:41:15,220 --> 02:41:21,020
They're throwing it in your face over and over again, and it all has been written about

2327
02:41:21,020 --> 02:41:29,500
200 years ago by Malthus, picked up 160 years ago by Galton, put out 100 years ago by HG

2328
02:41:29,500 --> 02:41:34,420
Wells, who wrote scores of nonfiction books, I happen to have read them.

2329
02:41:34,420 --> 02:41:38,460
In the movie Things to Come that came out what in the 30s, we guys find Things to Come,

2330
02:41:38,460 --> 02:41:46,020
they've got B2 bombers, bat wing bombers of the world government flying around blowing

2331
02:41:46,020 --> 02:41:49,900
up the holdout nation states and attacking gun owners.

2332
02:41:49,900 --> 02:42:00,180
And it's clearly American gun owners being killed in the book and the movie.

2333
02:42:00,180 --> 02:42:02,220
When do you write Things to Come in the 30s?

2334
02:42:02,220 --> 02:42:06,660
Like in 1901, he wrote a book where they had atomic weapons.

2335
02:42:06,660 --> 02:42:12,780
They already had the equations to build atomic weapons in the 1830s, ladies and gentlemen.

2336
02:42:12,780 --> 02:42:17,180
They are suppressing all of this stuff and they think they're God.

2337
02:42:17,180 --> 02:42:20,900
And agenda 21 is not to help you.

2338
02:42:20,900 --> 02:42:26,740
They take model cities, take the building restrictions off, take the taxes off to build

2339
02:42:26,740 --> 02:42:30,060
all a bunch of high rises and make them beautiful and make them sexy.

2340
02:42:30,060 --> 02:42:32,460
Austin is the world model of agenda 21.

2341
02:42:32,460 --> 02:42:37,140
You already take a great first class city, great people, low taxes, everything, build

2342
02:42:37,140 --> 02:42:43,260
it all fancy and say this is agenda 21 like a piece of cheese on a rat trap to bring the

2343
02:42:43,260 --> 02:42:45,660
rat in so it claps on his head.

2344
02:42:45,660 --> 02:42:47,780
Cheese smells good, cheese looks good.

2345
02:42:47,780 --> 02:42:51,060
And by the way, sometimes rats get really smart.

2346
02:42:51,060 --> 02:42:55,900
An old trick, an old wives tale trick, and I've had to do it, drop a few other pieces

2347
02:42:55,900 --> 02:43:01,220
of cheese on the ground lining up when they start seeing other rats get hit or mice get

2348
02:43:01,220 --> 02:43:04,360
hit by the trap and get clapped.

2349
02:43:04,360 --> 02:43:07,180
They stopped going and taking the cheese with the peanut butter.

2350
02:43:07,180 --> 02:43:09,540
Well, you know what you do?

2351
02:43:09,540 --> 02:43:13,020
You start putting other foods out because they associate the smell of that food with

2352
02:43:13,020 --> 02:43:14,020
getting killed.

2353
02:43:14,020 --> 02:43:18,580
Try this, does this, like the devil's always got this different sin.

2354
02:43:18,580 --> 02:43:19,580
That didn't work?

2355
02:43:19,580 --> 02:43:20,580
How about this?

2356
02:43:20,580 --> 02:43:22,700
Is this the lever I find to move you?

2357
02:43:22,700 --> 02:43:26,140
Well, if they stopped doing that, if you've killed 10 of the rats, you got to, they're

2358
02:43:26,140 --> 02:43:28,900
crapping in your attic, make stinking your house up.

2359
02:43:28,900 --> 02:43:29,900
What do you do next?

2360
02:43:29,900 --> 02:43:31,940
It happens to anybody who lives in the country.

2361
02:43:31,940 --> 02:43:36,720
You dribble a few pieces of cheese out on the floor knowing they're gonna eat a couple

2362
02:43:36,720 --> 02:43:38,940
pieces and think this is good.

2363
02:43:38,940 --> 02:43:40,260
This is good.

2364
02:43:40,260 --> 02:43:41,260
This is good.

2365
02:43:41,260 --> 02:43:45,900
I'm gonna get that last big piece, bam, you're dead.

2366
02:43:45,900 --> 02:43:49,780
Boom, you're dead.

2367
02:43:49,780 --> 02:43:54,060
Kill you and your rat family.

2368
02:43:54,060 --> 02:43:55,780
You don't buy his DVD.

2369
02:43:55,780 --> 02:44:00,020
It's an inside joke, one of my favorite videos out there.

2370
02:44:00,020 --> 02:44:04,860
All right, continuing here, ladies and gentlemen, I said I'd go to your phone calls and I need

2371
02:44:04,860 --> 02:44:05,860
to.

2372
02:44:05,860 --> 02:44:07,340
See, I could talk for 10 hours about Gen 21.

2373
02:44:07,340 --> 02:44:09,660
I haven't even gotten into all the evidence.

2374
02:44:09,660 --> 02:44:13,460
It's diabolical.

2375
02:44:13,460 --> 02:44:18,140
And I mean, here's an example of the system and how evil it is.

2376
02:44:18,140 --> 02:44:21,700
Did you know they're announcing in the United States if you are a sperm donor, they're going

2377
02:44:21,700 --> 02:44:29,460
to give your information over and make you pay child support?

2378
02:44:29,460 --> 02:44:33,020
That's a Gen 21, everything's a con game.

2379
02:44:33,020 --> 02:44:36,900
Sperm donor forced to pay child support to lesbian couple despite giving up parental

2380
02:44:36,900 --> 02:44:42,380
rights to the baby before she was born.

2381
02:44:42,380 --> 02:44:48,700
It turns out the women broke up and the woman went into the state.

2382
02:44:48,700 --> 02:44:49,700
And guess what?

2383
02:44:49,700 --> 02:44:50,700
The woman don't have to pay.

2384
02:44:50,700 --> 02:44:53,500
You gonna pay, Jack.

2385
02:44:53,500 --> 02:44:55,460
You gonna pay, Jack.

2386
02:44:55,460 --> 02:45:00,740
See, it's all about injustice.

2387
02:45:00,740 --> 02:45:01,740
All about injustice.

2388
02:45:01,740 --> 02:45:06,180
See, cuz he's a family man and produces and has some money.

2389
02:45:06,180 --> 02:45:09,740
You gonna pay.

2390
02:45:09,740 --> 02:45:14,780
And that's why they're racing to shut everything down because once they shut it down, they've

2391
02:45:14,780 --> 02:45:15,780
got you.

2392
02:45:15,780 --> 02:45:18,280
And, my gosh, we're going bankrupt.

2393
02:45:18,280 --> 02:45:20,140
We need to kill old people.

2394
02:45:20,140 --> 02:45:24,140
And yeah, are there doctors that greedily know they've got a brain dead woman or man,

2395
02:45:24,140 --> 02:45:30,300
79 years old, and they'll do double hip replacements and put 12 stints in their heart and do a

2396
02:45:30,300 --> 02:45:31,780
brain surgery?

2397
02:45:31,780 --> 02:45:38,780
Yep, and it's up to the state board to prosecute those people, not the feds who are ten times

2398
02:45:38,780 --> 02:45:39,780
more corrupt.

2399
02:45:39,780 --> 02:45:42,520
See, they can always point at little local corruption.

2400
02:45:42,520 --> 02:45:47,140
There are million dollar cases where they go and take somebody who can't be saved and

2401
02:45:47,140 --> 02:45:48,140
sit there and do this.

2402
02:45:48,140 --> 02:45:53,500
But that's why you can't have a free country that's not moral.

2403
02:45:53,500 --> 02:45:55,420
Rob Jacobson was talking to me during the last break.

2404
02:45:55,420 --> 02:46:00,540
And he said, why can't we arm teachers, but we're gonna arm cops and trust them?

2405
02:46:00,540 --> 02:46:04,700
And my example was, well, what about not arming pilots?

2406
02:46:04,700 --> 02:46:11,300
You trust them to fly this giant, multi-ton, giant, 100-ton aircraft, giant missile, tens

2407
02:46:11,300 --> 02:46:14,860
of thousands of times the power of a handgun or rifle, but you don't trust them to have

2408
02:46:14,860 --> 02:46:16,340
a gun in the cockpit.

2409
02:46:16,340 --> 02:46:22,060
Cuz the message is you can't protect yourself and you can't take care of anything.

2410
02:46:22,060 --> 02:46:28,660
And that's what a Gen 21 is, is the electronic kill grid, an attack on all civilization in

2411
02:46:28,660 --> 02:46:31,780
the name of a new civilization.

2412
02:46:31,780 --> 02:46:35,760
Because the globalists can't let us chart the course of technology in a good direction

2413
02:46:35,760 --> 02:46:41,260
because it will empower us to a level that will transcend the ancient psychopath guilds

2414
02:46:41,260 --> 02:46:46,220
that set up predatory subunits and prey on their own species.

2415
02:46:46,220 --> 02:46:55,780
We have decadent, degenerate, cancerous subspecies, homo sapiens psychopathicus, I don't know

2416
02:46:55,780 --> 02:46:58,540
what you wanna call it.

2417
02:46:58,540 --> 02:47:03,660
We must transcend them by knowledge and teaching and understanding.

2418
02:47:03,660 --> 02:47:10,060
Instead, we're letting these people play God because we don't crave being in charge, we

2419
02:47:10,060 --> 02:47:11,820
give the world to them.

2420
02:47:11,820 --> 02:47:16,220
You must first get over your fear and then you must move against the enemy or there's

2421
02:47:16,220 --> 02:47:17,220
no future.

2422
02:47:17,220 --> 02:47:21,580
You think it's fun to get up on the nightly news last night and have Stuart Rhodes say

2423
02:47:21,580 --> 02:47:22,700
the things he said on air?

2424
02:47:22,700 --> 02:47:24,700
It's very serious.

2425
02:47:24,700 --> 02:47:26,020
He's a serious person and so am I.

2426
02:47:26,020 --> 02:47:33,540
Now this isn't a game, this isn't a drill, this isn't a joke, this is the real deal.

2427
02:47:33,540 --> 02:47:34,920
You're being targeted.

2428
02:47:34,920 --> 02:47:38,460
They learned with Hitler, he moved too quick.

2429
02:47:38,460 --> 02:47:42,460
They know how to kill you quietly and softly now and they've got all these little subsets

2430
02:47:42,460 --> 02:47:43,460
of criminals.

2431
02:47:43,460 --> 02:47:48,940
They even rate in computer systems, mid-level minions and what type they are and their psychological

2432
02:47:48,940 --> 02:47:49,940
breakdown.

2433
02:47:49,940 --> 02:47:55,340
It's all there in the giant globalist NSA data banks and they place the different psychology

2434
02:47:55,340 --> 02:47:59,780
types in different formations, all because they have the fruits of our labor.

2435
02:47:59,780 --> 02:48:03,340
And soon they won't need the fruits of our labor because of robotics.

2436
02:48:03,340 --> 02:48:08,140
But they're gonna use the robotics in farming and manufacturing to first make us purely

2437
02:48:08,140 --> 02:48:15,300
dependent where we'll do anything to get those bobbles and trinkets of rank and social standing

2438
02:48:15,300 --> 02:48:17,380
but also survival.

2439
02:48:17,380 --> 02:48:21,020
And then all the trinkets we're given will have a backdoor control to dehumanize us and

2440
02:48:21,020 --> 02:48:28,820
track us and in the darkness bind us.

2441
02:48:28,820 --> 02:48:32,660
And so we must understand that they're gonna go, you're right, we can't trust pilots to

2442
02:48:32,660 --> 02:48:33,660
fly planes.

2443
02:48:33,660 --> 02:48:37,220
That's why they're robotic, who programs the robot.

2444
02:48:37,220 --> 02:48:42,900
We're entering a psycho world run by technocrats, you're in a science fiction movie.

2445
02:48:42,900 --> 02:48:49,620
And let me tell you, Gangnam style, I mean, all that stuff is rhythmically designed to

2446
02:48:49,620 --> 02:48:54,060
distract you, to divert you, all the little goofy programmed world where everything's

2447
02:48:54,060 --> 02:48:55,060
fun.

2448
02:48:55,060 --> 02:48:59,300
Everything's funny, don't worry, it's all fun, it's all good, government loves me.

2449
02:48:59,300 --> 02:49:00,300
It's a fraud.

2450
02:49:00,300 --> 02:49:04,060
They're not gonna stop just killing the old people.

2451
02:49:04,060 --> 02:49:06,740
They're gonna kill you and they're already killing you.

2452
02:49:06,740 --> 02:49:10,720
And they're already introducing the idea of, all of Africa just died from that airborne

2453
02:49:10,720 --> 02:49:12,500
Ebola or that mouse box.

2454
02:49:12,500 --> 02:49:16,260
We've gotta lock down our cities, thank God we're safe.

2455
02:49:16,260 --> 02:49:21,660
And yeah, yeah, well, you've retired now and we don't need you anymore, you're obsolete

2456
02:49:21,660 --> 02:49:23,060
so we're gonna get rid of you.

2457
02:49:23,060 --> 02:49:25,340
That's actually the plan.

2458
02:49:25,340 --> 02:49:29,380
Let's go to Bill Gates talking about it, here it is.

2459
02:49:29,380 --> 02:49:37,460
Bill Gates breaking it down, ladies and gentlemen.

2460
02:49:37,460 --> 02:49:40,660
We had a tricaster heart attack, all day we've been prepared to play this.

2461
02:49:40,660 --> 02:49:46,460
This is a trade-off society is making because of very, very high medical costs and a lack

2462
02:49:46,460 --> 02:49:51,180
of willingness to say, is spending a million dollars on that last three months of life

2463
02:49:51,180 --> 02:49:58,620
for that patient, would it be better not to lay off those 10 teachers and to make that

2464
02:49:58,620 --> 02:49:59,800
trade-off in medical costs?

2465
02:49:59,800 --> 02:50:04,180
But that's called the death panel and you're not supposed to have that discussion.

2466
02:50:04,180 --> 02:50:05,180
So you...

2467
02:50:05,180 --> 02:50:06,180
Of course...

2468
02:50:06,180 --> 02:50:10,700
Is it more interesting than you just said, would you just, the last three months in life

2469
02:50:10,700 --> 02:50:16,100
for one person or something, because we haven't had a discussion of how to allocate that money,

2470
02:50:16,100 --> 02:50:18,620
it means we lay off three teachers to do so.

2471
02:50:18,620 --> 02:50:22,780
I mean, in other words, we haven't had this type of allocation.

2472
02:50:22,780 --> 02:50:28,400
We're making that trade-off because of huge medical costs that are not examined to see

2473
02:50:28,400 --> 02:50:29,400
what...

2474
02:50:29,400 --> 02:50:30,400
That's enough.

2475
02:50:30,400 --> 02:50:34,980
And then you let a guy whose dad, it was the head of Planned Parenthood, an open eugenicist,

2476
02:50:34,980 --> 02:50:38,940
so is Bill and his wife, you let a guy run your healthcare.

2477
02:50:38,940 --> 02:50:43,620
The mistake we made was letting government and foreign corporations take over the healthcare

2478
02:50:43,620 --> 02:50:46,800
and now they can totally engineer us.

2479
02:50:46,800 --> 02:50:50,540
And I was talking to CJ during the last break, he'll come back and talk about it, about the

2480
02:50:50,540 --> 02:50:55,060
illegal aliens are the only one that get charity care now because they're a client group meant

2481
02:50:55,060 --> 02:50:59,940
to drive down the wages here domestically, just like prison labor.

2482
02:50:59,940 --> 02:51:02,860
Hi, this is Alex Jones.

2483
02:51:02,860 --> 02:51:06,820
Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage

2484
02:51:06,820 --> 02:51:08,460
vaults near the Arctic Circle?

2485
02:51:08,460 --> 02:51:12,500
Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver

2486
02:51:12,500 --> 02:51:13,500
or gold?

2487
02:51:13,500 --> 02:51:16,860
It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's

2488
02:51:16,860 --> 02:51:19,040
possible that could even happen again.

2489
02:51:19,040 --> 02:51:23,220
So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid

2490
02:51:23,220 --> 02:51:24,220
seeds.

2491
02:51:24,220 --> 02:51:29,500
They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense

2492
02:51:29,500 --> 02:51:31,380
food for you and your family.

2493
02:51:31,380 --> 02:51:35,260
And here's the best part, these seeds have not been genetically modified in any way,

2494
02:51:35,260 --> 02:51:39,180
and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.

2495
02:51:39,180 --> 02:51:44,860
So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com, that's survivalseedbank.com, or give them

2513
02:53:05,220 --> 02:53:10,020
Hi, I'm Pastor Ginny, and that was the state I was in back in 2010.

2514
02:53:10,020 --> 02:53:12,020
Then I learned about RNA drops.

2515
02:53:12,020 --> 02:53:17,720
I learned that 97% of my DNA that scientists have called junk is actually packed with millions

2516
02:53:17,720 --> 02:53:22,900
of gene switches that play a critical role in controlling how my cells, organs, and other

2517
02:53:22,900 --> 02:53:23,900
tissues behave.

2518
02:53:23,900 --> 02:53:27,640
I learned I don't have to put up with disease decay or decline like I'd been conditioned

2519
02:53:27,640 --> 02:53:28,640
to believe.

2520
02:53:28,640 --> 02:53:34,460
I began taking RNA drops, a 100% natural formula designed to turn on those switches and provide

2521
02:53:34,460 --> 02:53:36,620
me with amazing health and joy.

Ease the T-Rex of political talk.

2527
02:54:04,540 --> 02:54:07,380
Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.

2528
02:54:07,380 --> 02:54:14,300
Today there's an article in the New York Times, no, not the one calling for us to turn all

2529
02:54:14,300 --> 02:54:21,460
our guns in, literally, Georgetown law professor scrap archaic, idiosyncratic, and downright

2530
02:54:21,460 --> 02:54:22,460
evil constitution.

2531
02:54:22,460 --> 02:54:23,940
That's a quote.

2532
02:54:23,940 --> 02:54:30,300
Well, of course, a tyrant would call something that keeps separation of powers and checks

2533
02:54:30,300 --> 02:54:32,860
and balances evil.

2534
02:54:32,860 --> 02:54:37,620
As the nation teeters on the edge of fiscal chaos, observers are reaching the conclusion

2535
02:54:37,620 --> 02:54:40,180
that the American system of government is broken.

2536
02:54:40,180 --> 02:54:45,260
Cuz globalists have infiltrated it and maneuvered us towards being bankrupt, and the Republicans

2537
02:54:45,260 --> 02:54:49,940
and Democrats are arguing over how much to increase taxes and how much to gut the country.

2538
02:54:49,940 --> 02:54:56,420
Yeah, it's broken cuz you can't fully bankrupt us ten times over like you've done Greece.

2539
02:54:56,420 --> 02:55:01,620
They wanna wreck us, folks, as the nation teeters on the edge of fiscal chaos.

2540
02:55:01,620 --> 02:55:06,020
Yeah, by you people, observers are reaching the conclusion.

2541
02:55:06,020 --> 02:55:09,500
And then the weak-minded go, yeah, I am, I'm mad about the Constitution.

2542
02:55:09,500 --> 02:55:15,060
Darn it with property rights and juries and freedom and everything that made the country

2543
02:55:15,060 --> 02:55:16,060
so wealthy.

2544
02:55:16,060 --> 02:55:17,900
I want what they've got in North Korea.

2545
02:55:17,900 --> 02:55:22,500
I want instant access with one hereditary dictator with big fat cheeks running everything.

2546
02:55:22,500 --> 02:55:25,680
Hey, Hans, how you doing, Hans Blix?

2547
02:55:25,680 --> 02:55:27,700
Come on in, Hans.

2548
02:55:27,700 --> 02:55:30,220
We wanna resurrect Kim Jong-il, put him in charge.

2549
02:55:30,220 --> 02:55:32,780
Yeah, he'll get things done.

2550
02:55:32,780 --> 02:55:35,420
And this guy, it's not a dumb liberal.

2551
02:55:35,420 --> 02:55:38,300
It's not a liberal saying get rid of our Constitution.

2552
02:55:38,300 --> 02:55:41,340
They're pig tyrants.

2553
02:55:41,340 --> 02:55:43,300
But they walk around with the NPR voice.

2554
02:55:43,300 --> 02:55:45,380
Hi, I'm real friendly.

2555
02:55:45,380 --> 02:55:46,380
Get in the car, little kid.

2556
02:55:46,380 --> 02:55:47,380
It's the same thing.

2557
02:55:47,380 --> 02:55:50,620
Shh, kid, no, get in the glue truck, little Orsi.

2558
02:55:50,620 --> 02:55:54,580
I talk real soft and act non-threatening.

2559
02:55:54,580 --> 02:55:58,140
Though we got the government arming against you, we want your guns.

2560
02:55:58,140 --> 02:56:01,460
Yeah, we're real friendly.

2561
02:56:01,460 --> 02:56:02,460
We're real liberal.

2562
02:56:02,460 --> 02:56:03,460
Yeah.

2563
02:56:03,460 --> 02:56:09,300
You know, I get around these people and behind the scenes they're like, when we get you in

2564
02:56:09,300 --> 02:56:14,460
the feet of the cabs, we're gonna stomp your guts out and rape your wife.

2565
02:56:14,460 --> 02:56:16,820
But in public, I'm liberal.

2566
02:56:16,820 --> 02:56:21,900
I mean, just look at these people as the nation teeters.

2567
02:56:21,900 --> 02:56:27,540
Let me do it in the Ted Knight voice, as the nation teeters on the edge of financial chaos.

2568
02:56:27,540 --> 02:56:32,980
Observers are reaching the conclusion that the American system of government is broken.

2569
02:56:32,980 --> 02:56:37,100
Seidman wrote, but almost no one blames the culprit.

2570
02:56:37,100 --> 02:56:44,440
Our insistence on obedience to the Constitution with all its archaic, idiosyncratic, and downright

2571
02:56:44,440 --> 02:56:46,220
evil provisions.

2572
02:56:46,220 --> 02:56:47,820
Time to scrap it.

2573
02:56:47,820 --> 02:56:51,600
Time to scrap you, parasite.

2574
02:56:51,600 --> 02:56:57,580
Some nobody professor perched in there with Obama at Georgetown, perched in there like

2575
02:56:57,580 --> 02:57:05,020
an elitist, seeing all of us like salami sandwiches in the coal case to be eaten off of and figuring

2576
02:57:05,020 --> 02:57:09,980
out ways in the government empire that if we could just increase taxes and increase

2577
02:57:09,980 --> 02:57:18,300
productivity, we would be able to have a higher standard of living for us, the governing class.

2578
02:57:18,300 --> 02:57:23,620
All I know how to do is sit around and act powerful and official all day.

2579
02:57:23,620 --> 02:57:29,820
I mean, these people that run this government promote torture, murder, death, and then you

2580
02:57:29,820 --> 02:57:35,820
see the lazy eyed Obama supporter, the average idiot, literally stumbling around half dead

2581
02:57:35,820 --> 02:57:37,580
from vaccines and GMO.

2582
02:57:37,580 --> 02:57:41,780
When they're 30 years old, they look like they're 50, they're killing us all.

2583
02:57:41,780 --> 02:57:47,340
Just look at the kids look like dead slobs everywhere, rich neighborhoods, poor neighborhoods.

2584
02:57:47,340 --> 02:57:49,780
They're just killing all of us, just zombies.

2585
02:57:49,780 --> 02:57:53,140
And that's what I tell us were zombies always movies because we're turning into zombies

2586
02:57:53,140 --> 02:57:57,340
and it can be a simulation of there's always video games where you torture zombies now

2587
02:57:57,340 --> 02:58:00,260
and the zombies are getting more and more human.

2588
02:58:00,260 --> 02:58:02,500
And again, it's all stimulants to dehumanize us.

2589
02:58:02,500 --> 02:58:04,860
They're telling us you're garbage, you're undead.

2590
02:58:04,860 --> 02:58:08,140
We don't need you because see, they don't need biological androids anymore.

2591
02:58:08,140 --> 02:58:10,300
They've got machines now.

2592
02:58:10,300 --> 02:58:14,020
Doesn't mean they won't take their time and have fun cutting off your resources and having

2593
02:58:14,020 --> 02:58:17,660
your daughters, you know, get in the backs of their limousines to service them.

2594
02:58:17,660 --> 02:58:22,780
All the elite literally defecate on them in many cases, you know, you know, see your daughter

2595
02:58:22,780 --> 02:58:23,780
can get some money.

2596
02:58:23,780 --> 02:58:24,780
It won't matter.

2597
02:58:24,780 --> 02:58:29,860
Oh, they're going to take their time psychopathically America and the world is one giant basement

2598
02:58:29,860 --> 02:58:33,900
where a psychopath has all of us just having their way with us and they really want to

2599
02:58:33,900 --> 02:58:35,300
have their way with us now.

2600
02:58:35,300 --> 02:58:41,220
But the second amendment stands on their way of gang raping and pulling our teeth out with

2601
02:58:41,220 --> 02:58:42,220
pliers.

2602
02:58:42,220 --> 02:58:46,340

2611
02:59:20,700 --> 02:59:25,340
Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents which quickly evaporate and

2612
02:59:25,340 --> 02:59:30,500
leave the silver at the surface, but rather we have formulated our silver gel using the

2613
02:59:30,500 --> 02:59:35,060
natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the

2614
02:59:35,060 --> 02:59:39,060
skin while delivering the silver more effectively.

You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.

2620
03:00:12,700 --> 03:00:17,140
By the way, I'm not joking and I've been in DC and other areas and I watched the cream.

2621
03:00:17,140 --> 03:00:19,500
These women are more beautiful than Miss America.

2622
03:00:19,500 --> 03:00:26,300
Loading in to all the UN vehicles and ambassador vehicles to go to the different globalist

2623
03:00:26,300 --> 03:00:31,340
facilities and literally, because you can read about statistically what the globalist

2624
03:00:31,340 --> 03:00:35,260
are into, their art, everything, to absolutely desecrate beauty.

2625
03:00:35,260 --> 03:00:38,220
That's what they live for.

2626
03:00:38,220 --> 03:00:45,380
And because it's an act of domination because these are nasty demons and I for one am done

2627
03:00:45,380 --> 03:00:46,380
with them.

2628
03:00:46,380 --> 03:00:51,580
And I just wanna make sure that when the globalists implode our country, everybody knows who did

2629
03:00:51,580 --> 03:00:52,580
it.

2630
03:00:52,580 --> 03:00:54,900
Cuz what matters is who wins in the end.

2631
03:00:54,900 --> 03:00:57,900
All's well that ends well, hmm?

2632
03:00:57,900 --> 03:00:58,900
That's right.

2633
03:00:58,900 --> 03:01:04,780
Did you think the universe would not organically generate things to resist you?

2634
03:01:04,780 --> 03:01:08,920
You think your stupid computers that you can't even read are gonna be able to predict what

2635
03:01:08,920 --> 03:01:10,460
humans are gonna do?

2636
03:01:10,460 --> 03:01:12,900
You will destroy yourselves.

2637
03:01:12,900 --> 03:01:16,640
Let me consciously tell you the truth.

2638
03:01:16,640 --> 03:01:20,140
Your body is already ordering you dead.

2639
03:01:20,140 --> 03:01:25,580
Because even though you're consciously a psychopath and inhabited by dark evil, your body, your

2640
03:01:25,580 --> 03:01:30,300
flesh even cries out against you.

2641
03:01:30,300 --> 03:01:33,900
Because it was made by the creator and that's why you're so miserable and why you're so

2642
03:01:33,900 --> 03:01:35,700
sick all you evil people.

2643
03:01:35,700 --> 03:01:39,660
That's why you wanna make us sick cuz you're inherently spiritually sick.

2644
03:01:39,660 --> 03:01:42,980
Well, let me tell you, the pit you've dug, you will fall into it.

2645
03:01:42,980 --> 03:01:43,980
We will not.

2646
03:01:43,980 --> 03:01:47,420
Feinstein and the militia, Jay, you're on the air, go ahead.

2647
03:01:47,420 --> 03:01:50,380
Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call.

2648
03:01:50,380 --> 03:01:52,380
Thank you, sir, for holding my call.

2649
03:01:52,380 --> 03:01:58,780
I wanted to mention a video on YouTube I saw a while back about the militia, the American

2650
03:01:58,780 --> 03:02:11,060
militia movement in 1995 confronting the Senate subcommittee on terrorism with Dianne Feinstein.

2651
03:02:11,060 --> 03:02:16,500
And they basically go up there a couple months after the Oklahoma City bombings-

2652
03:02:16,500 --> 03:02:18,580
No, and they blame gun owners as terrorists.

2653
03:02:18,580 --> 03:02:20,420
In fact, I saw those hearings live.

2654
03:02:20,420 --> 03:02:21,780
What was the name of them?

2655
03:02:21,780 --> 03:02:24,340
It was the Senate subcommittee on what?

2656
03:02:24,340 --> 03:02:28,900
It was the United States Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Terrorism.

2657
03:02:28,900 --> 03:02:32,020
And I think it might have changed names a couple times or something.

2658
03:02:32,020 --> 03:02:44,320
But anyway, it's just a perfect example of Mrs. Feinstein using race and demonizing the

2659
03:02:44,320 --> 03:02:47,260
militia movement after this bombing happened.

2660
03:02:47,260 --> 03:02:48,260
It's a really good video.

2661
03:02:48,260 --> 03:02:55,020
You can see her, she asked them, each one to answer the question, do you think in any

2662
03:02:55,020 --> 03:02:58,180
circumstance it is okay to bomb a building?

2663
03:02:58,180 --> 03:03:01,060
And they get mad, and it's such a dumb question.

2664
03:03:01,060 --> 03:03:03,500
I've seen those famous militia hearings.

2665
03:03:03,500 --> 03:03:06,420
We ought to re-air some of those tomorrow.

2666
03:03:06,420 --> 03:03:10,220
It's Senate militia hearings, and there was a couple of them, but they're pretty powerful.

2667
03:03:10,220 --> 03:03:13,420
And then there's a black militia guy, and they're asking if he hates black people, talking

2668
03:03:13,420 --> 03:03:14,420
about that one?

2669
03:03:14,420 --> 03:03:15,420
It's so stupid.

2670
03:03:15,420 --> 03:03:22,820
Well, absolutely, no, no, no, I've seen the hearings, I will get to it.

2671
03:03:22,820 --> 03:03:25,180
Thank you so much, God bless you, I'm glad you brought that up.

2672
03:03:25,180 --> 03:03:28,780
Heck, that's the hearing where she's talking about concealed carry.

2673
03:03:28,780 --> 03:03:33,220
Sabra in Washington, last person we have time to get to, thanks for holding her on the air.

2674
03:03:33,220 --> 03:03:40,380
Oh, Alex, Alex, this is Klingon from Washington State, Alex, I love you, Alex, you're Elijah,

2675
03:03:40,380 --> 03:03:41,380
Alex.

2676
03:03:41,380 --> 03:03:44,420
Alex, Alex, you're Elijah, you got the saints backing you up.

2677
03:03:44,420 --> 03:03:50,660
Now listen to me, last night on George Norridge, 1247, Pacific time, he said his granddaughter,

2678
03:03:50,660 --> 03:03:55,780
Rhianna, 18 years old, was run off the road yesterday, twirled around down an embankment.

2679
03:03:55,780 --> 03:03:56,780
He was very upset.

2680
03:03:56,780 --> 03:03:57,780
December 15th, Alex, are you listening, darling?

2681
03:03:57,780 --> 03:03:58,780
Do you hear me?

2682
03:03:58,780 --> 03:03:59,780
Yes.

2683
03:03:59,780 --> 03:04:00,780
They wait for me, Alex.

2684
03:04:00,780 --> 03:04:01,780
They tried to rendition me, Alex.

2685
03:04:01,780 --> 03:04:02,780
Do you remember me?

2686
03:04:02,780 --> 03:04:03,780
I'm Klingon from Yahoo!

2687
03:04:03,780 --> 03:04:04,780
Chat.

2688
03:04:04,780 --> 03:04:05,780
I'm Sabra.

2689
03:04:05,780 --> 03:04:06,780
I raise and train Rottweilers.

2690
03:04:06,780 --> 03:04:07,780
Yeah, yeah, what happened to you?

2691
03:04:07,780 --> 03:04:08,780
What happened to you?

2692
03:04:08,780 --> 03:04:16,780
Oh, Alex, this was their technique, this was their technique.

2693
03:04:16,780 --> 03:04:20,460
I only get off the property two or three times a year, we live on 30 acres, we're always

2694
03:04:20,460 --> 03:04:24,580
working against the Satanists, always, trust me, we're really busy.

2695
03:04:24,580 --> 03:04:28,380
Two or three years I get off the property, I went out for the first time in four months,

2696
03:04:28,380 --> 03:04:33,860
they're on me, I'm coming back home, I'm at a stop sign, out of town, we live south of

2697
03:04:33,860 --> 03:04:34,860
Bellingham, Washington.

2698
03:04:34,860 --> 03:04:35,860
And what happened?

2699
03:04:35,860 --> 03:04:41,820
Yes, I'm at the light, it didn't turn red, I got a big one-ton van, sucks in behind me,

2700
03:04:41,820 --> 03:04:47,540
an E-350 Mercedes is in front of me, I noticed right away, something was different.

2701
03:04:47,540 --> 03:04:48,540
What'd they do?

2702
03:04:48,540 --> 03:04:49,540
What'd they do to you?

2703
03:04:49,540 --> 03:04:50,540
We're almost out of time.

2704
03:04:50,540 --> 03:04:54,780
Oh, Alex, they tried to kill me, when they couldn't rendition me and stop me, they tried

2705
03:04:54,780 --> 03:04:56,940
to run me into a pile of 20 cars.

2706
03:04:56,940 --> 03:05:06,700
No, they got their black ops everywhere, everybody better be ready.
