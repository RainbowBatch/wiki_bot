1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:28,920
he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.

3
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:36,520
Here we are, Monday, already the fourth day of February, 2013. I am your host, Alex Jones.

4
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:43,440
All right, here's what's going to happen. We've got Lord Monckton, who is over in Australia,

5
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,880
popping in for 30 minutes at the tail end of the broadcast today. He's going to be joining

6
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:56,760
us to talk about agenda 21, four or five years ahead of us, because Australia, more than

7
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:02,800
any other country, except for maybe England, is implementing this neo-feudalistic form

8
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,800
of serfdom.

9
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:09,440
And that's the UN's own words. They've called for a fake environmentalism to bring in serfdom

10
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:23,640
to control the population. So that's coming up. Now, we are going to open the phones up

11
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:30,840
and take your phone calls here today as well. Yesterday, on the Sunday broadcast, I said

12
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:39,560
that I was going to cover the mysterious death of Chris Kyle, the highly decorated Navy SEAL,

13
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:44,680
who was involved in all sorts of clandestine black ops, obviously, and wrote the Navy's

14
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,240
official sniper manual, their new sniper manual.

15
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,640
They didn't have one previous to that. They used the Marine Corps sniper manual. But he

16
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,880
wrote an updated manual, and he was deep into the system, obviously, and was the head trainer

17
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:03,400
for the Navy SEALs in their sharpshooting program. We saw the Navy SEALs helicopter

18
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:08,040
and SEAL Team 6 blow up with 20-something of them aboard. We saw the other helicopter

19
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,560
blow up in the fake bin Laden raid.

20
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,140
So much of this is domestic shy ops. And the SEALs more and more are used as a political

21
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:23,520
core with the new SEAL Team 6 Zero Dark Thirty movie, which they admit is basically fiction.

22
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,700
We're being bombarded with lies. And I gotta tell you, the fact that he was pushing to

23
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:35,520
put guns in schools and armed teachers, and the fact that he knew so many secrets, and

24
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,360
then somebody he takes up to the range with PTSD trying to help him.

25
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,680
That's the story we're told. We don't know if any of this is true. We're being told this

26
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:49,280
by the government, and then he's killed. You see, I'm not a conspiracy theorist in the

27
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:57,400
way the media uses it. When known liars, certified liars, who've been caught lying over and over

28
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:02,360
and over again and caught staging things, tell me something, I don't just immediately

29
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,640
believe it.

30
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:08,240
That doesn't mean the official story isn't true, because sometimes you get people who

31
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:16,100
are not corrupt in the system, or it's a real event. Sometimes the truth comes out because

32
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:21,880
you've got good people in media, good people in government, and it's not a staged event.

33
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,740
And so you'll have regular folks involved.

34
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:30,360
But when it is a staged event, you'll see key players involved and key scripting, and

35
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:36,520
you'll see an official story being put out very, very quickly. And the shaping immediately

36
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:41,960
and the preparation and the unification of the propaganda is a telltale sign. We saw

37
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:46,880
that with the Aurora shooting in Colorado, and then all the other telltale signs.

38
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:51,760
And we do see it in Sandy Hook to a great extent. I believe there was a shooting there.

39
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:57,200
It's like we say there's an inside job on 9-11. That just means criminal elements of

40
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,300
the globalist structure somehow open the door, allowed it to happen, ordered stand downs.

41
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:07,660
We know that happened. We know the official story's a lie. Does it mean there aren't quote

42
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:08,660
Muslim extremists?

43
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:13,600
But see, the system comes out and has their operatives say, there were no planes. And

44
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:20,560
the originator of that, it later turned out, worked for the CIA. Very strange. See, so

45
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:26,920
when I say there could be government involvement or criminal involvement by other actors, yet

46
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:33,800
Sandy Hook, the spin is, you're saying nobody died. No, I'm saying people did die.

47
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,960
But there's clear scripting and things. So it's a complex issue, but we're gonna be getting

48
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:44,320
into that. The power outage, it appeared to be staged by yours truly. They're getting

49
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,880
you ready, and they've said this, to have more and more power outages across America.

50
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:54,520
This is gonna be a new way of life, just as it was in Romania under Ceausescu. So we're

51
00:04:54,520 --> 00:05:00,600
gonna break that down as well. In the latest Second Amendment news, it is all key.

52
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:05,320
Looking back on 2012, I know personally I'm thanking God that my family and I made it

53
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:09,280
through the year. From natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer

54
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,520
drought to the family hardships brought on by a disastrous economy. Our hearts go out

55
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,600
to those that have lost everything. My friends at eFoods Direct hear from customers every

56
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,840
day that are fortunate to weather life's storm by having a supply of food on hand. Danny

57
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,320
from New York City wrote in following Hurricane Sandy and said, Almost all the grocery stores

58
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,400
are closed, but I managed to get my eFoods just in time to be able to help my sister

59
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,520
and my niece. Bottom line, it's better to be prepared 10 years too early than one day

87
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:56,460
Don't tread on me. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this live Monday

88
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:06,640
edition. Marines to invade South Carolina. That is just the daily news as large expeditionary

89
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:15,260
forces of the army, the Marines, the TSA, you name it. Practice taking over capital

90
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:20,980
buildings, practice taking over schools, practice taking over malls. And I have been to many

91
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:25,420
of these urban warfare training events, but we also see it now currently reported in the

92
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,420
news.

93
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:33,580
In many of the drills they practice mowing down human wave attacks. They are simulating

94
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:39,580
killing, in some cases, unarmed American citizens. And when the public videotapes it and gets

95
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:47,100
upset, they say, it's a zombie drill. It's a joke. That's why we've got 1000 Marines

96
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:53,960
landing in San Diego a few months ago to practice killing zombies. That's why there's black

97
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:58,740
helicopters that lease a building in the middle of town and then blow it up and catch it on

98
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:04,740
fire and men are repelling down off ropes and the police are involved. It's all to acclimate

99
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:10,080
and condition the public on record for martial law.

100
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:16,580
It's all official in the army training manuals, in the army times, in Stars and Stripes, brigade

101
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:24,620
homeland since 2008 has been officially announced. And they plan to have troop force up to 370

102
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:28,820
plus thousand troops, that is the goal. And they're gonna pull them out of Iraq, out of

103
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:32,140
Afghanistan, and they're gonna be the new domestic military.

104
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:37,420
And you're going to have Obama, we have a clip of that coming up in a moment, running

105
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:45,420
around, giving more speeches saying, we need a domestic security force, just as big, just

106
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:53,020
as strong as our military. You've all seen and heard that quote over and over and over

107
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:59,100
again. And we should do another special report this week showing top brass talking about

108
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,420
it on C-SPAN.

109
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:07,140
The Pentagon talking about it in Pentagon videos online. You've got not just Rahm Emanuel

110
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:10,740
in two different speeches saying you'll have national service. But now you're seeing all

111
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:16,140
these other groups pushing for it and they're telling high schoolers, hey, it's gonna be

112
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:19,440
compulsory that you serve in the new FEMA Corps.

113
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:25,220
But it's not gonna be planting trees. It's not gonna be building national park bunk houses

114
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:29,780
like they had in the 30s and 40s with the national make work programs. It's gonna be

115
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:37,340
unpaid compulsory volunteerism, which is another Orwellian term. This is the insanity of the

116
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:39,180
world that we live in.

117
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:47,540
Look at this other article up at infoawars.com. Robots replace waiters in China. That's right.

118
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:52,980
They're not just going to replace manufacturing jobs and have robots working on the robots.

119
00:11:52,980 --> 00:12:01,620
No, now they're going to replace people as waiters. And again, the globalist have decided

120
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:08,860
to go with this angle to make humans obsolete.

121
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:19,140
To make humans obsolete, to fully get control of the civilization, and to have a technocratic

122
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:24,340
centralized system. And people say, this is a terrible future you're telling us about.

123
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:30,380
I'm not the one manifesting this. The globalist are engineering it in that direction. We're

124
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,780
gonna be going over that report.

125
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:39,260
Reuters report contradicts Obama skeet shooting photo. I don't even know what to say about

126
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:45,780
this other than it's definitely a shy up. And this is cognitive dissonance that Cass

127
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:58,280
Sunstein talked about and that Cass Sunstein engaged in, what, four years ago in public

128
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:01,780
white papers. And that's why he was hired and brought into the White House. He's now

129
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,960
left the White House for four years.

130
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:14,580
He was the head of their policy board. He was the czar, the regulation czar. I know

131
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:27,500
shotguns. And I have photographed and videotaped, even as a novice before I had a TV show, firing

132
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:34,460
shotguns and firing rifles and firing handguns over and over again. And I can tell you right

133
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:39,680
now, that looks like a fake photo to me.

134
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:45,660
And I actually noticed that first there's a controversy that, he doesn't really skeet

135
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:50,820
shooter like guns, which they kinda stirred up. And then the White House over the weekend,

136
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:54,460
and I'm gonna cover this, I have it here in the stack once we get over some of the top

137
00:13:54,460 --> 00:14:02,380
news. The White House comes out and says, don't you claim this isn't real?

138
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:06,980
And then another little comment, they say, by the way, this is copyright, no one is allowed

139
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:13,500
to Photoshop this. This is only for media. Knowing that that will stir people up and

140
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:17,540
make them go out and Photoshop it. And by the way, I've looked at the precedent, I've

141
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:23,340
looked at the law, White House photos are public domain, you paid for it.

142
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:27,060
That's why you can go to the National Archives and just pay for the copying, pay for the

143
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:34,860
cost of copying and the tape, or now the hard drive, and get all of the gun pod footage,

144
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:40,100
get all of the hydrogen bombs going off. Companies take it and then remaster it and then call

145
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:44,660
it copyright, or the voiceover is copyright on Discovery Channel or History Channel, but

146
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,180
not the footage.

147
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:50,540
And so I've actually looked into this, I've actually purchased National Archive film.

148
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:55,860
I've actually, you have to actually get it through another company or go and you have

149
00:14:55,860 --> 00:15:00,300
to send someone in with the archivist and that's how you buy it and get it. So I've

150
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:04,020
actually been through the process, I know. Why would they come out and say, you will

151
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:06,740
not use this, you will not Photoshop that?

152
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:11,620
Cass Sunstein said, we'll go in and stir them up, we'll put out fake conspiracies. We'll

153
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:17,500
get everybody hyped up, we'll get everybody diverted, we'll get everybody to look at fake

154
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:21,100
conspiracy theories or conspiracy theories that don't matter.

155
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:26,520
He wrote two papers on it, one for Chicago Business School, the Neocon outfit, and one

156
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:31,460
for Harvard, look them up. He wrote them six years ago and then wrote more papers when

157
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:37,540
he got in the White House in 2009. I mean, just look it up, Cass Sunstein, cognitive

158
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,540
infiltration.

159
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:45,440
I always say cognitive dissonance, it's cognitive infiltration. And that's what they're doing

160
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:51,100
here. They put out a blatantly fake birth certificate, show that we'd run around and

161
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:57,020
talk about it all day knowing the public would just choose sides or get confused. While the

162
00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:02,380
insider trading goes on by Congress, while the UN openly is in command of our military

163
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:07,920
along with NATO, while our government publicly arms and commands al-Qaeda in Libya and Syria

164
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:12,280
and Mali and a bunch of other places.

165
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:23,380
LTSA occupies every major city from Seattle to LA to Dallas, Austin, Texas, Houston, Texas,

166
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:31,660
Kansas City, Chicago, New York City, Boston, you name it. You name it, they're there. I

167
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:40,340
mean, they're now there with quote spot checks on South Lamar at the bus terminals and the

168
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:44,440
train terminals, but they also are doing it to people on the highway now.

169
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:48,700
And it's totally illegal, and they search everybody's bags without warrants. And they're

170
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:57,740
out of their jurisdiction, and it's all just a probing operation. And that ties in to this

171
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:06,380
information that's coming up. Why is the government stockpiling guns and ammo? Joseph Farah, Worldnet

172
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:11,660
Daily asked. And he says, why is the government gearing up for war?

173
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:15,000
Why are they buying billions of bullets? Why are they buying only automatic weapons? Why

174
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,400
are they buying armored vehicles? He says it's about the civilian National Security

175
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:26,480
Force as big, as strong, as well-funded as the Defense Department, to quote Barack Obama.

176
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:36,200
And Farah says that's what he believes is going on. He says, I have some theories. Those

177
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:41,940
of us that have been right all along need to stop saying we have theories. I'm gonna

178
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:48,520
get Joseph Farah back on. I'm gonna get him back on this week or next week, because it's

179
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,520
all there.

180
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:55,820
It's like you walk into your living room, there's a giant elephant sitting there on

181
00:17:55,820 --> 00:18:01,800
top of a pile of crap, excuse my French. And you're like, I don't know, I got a theory,

182
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:05,620
that looks like an elephant. You're like, well, it's got big ears, it's just a gray,

183
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:12,580
it's got hair, it's got giant feet, it's got cusks. I don't know, though. Look, it's all

184
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:15,560
in the army memos, the army manuals.

185
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:19,440
Maybe Farah's just a good writer and he knows people like a mystery. I notice everybody

186
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,180
always calls me with, I think there's a FEMA camp in my neighborhood. I mean, under the

187
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:27,400
Model States Health Emergency Powers Act, they designate the centers. And then you can

188
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:33,120
cross-reference it with the Emergency Centers Establishment Act that just was giving more

189
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,340
funding to already existing facilities and plans.

190
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:42,520
And then it matches up to the 2002 FEMA plan. And you can look up all the clergy response

191
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:46,000
team training, what they're training the preachers for, to quote, go to the FEMA camp, take the

192
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,860
shots, turn your guns in when you're told, this is all official. And then five years,

193
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:58,120
four years after we break the news here on Genesis, it's mainstream media, and InfraGuard,

194
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:02,360
and Brigade Homeland, and Army Times, and all the countless drills.

195
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:07,720
And I've talked to the Delta Force people off record. They talked to Lieutenant Beck

196
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:12,920
here in town. He gave me info, so they ran him out of the SWAT team. Vietnam veteran,

197
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:17,060
patriot, great guy, ran him out, kicked him out of the Travis County SWAT team because

198
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:22,520
he gave me information that was not classified.

199
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:25,480
I went in his office two years before and I said, you're gonna be approached by Delta

200
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:29,960
Force. And when they do, you need to understand it's illegal. And they're gonna offer you

201
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:34,040
money. And this is part of a corruption program, just like they corrupt third world countries.

202
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:38,480
That's how they took over Iraq. And I said, next, they're gonna be asking you to deal

203
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:44,320
drugs. And he said, get out of here. That's posse comitatus. I'm a Vietnam sniper vet.

204
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,960
That's unconstitutional. It'll never happen. You're nuts. And I said, they're approaching

205
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:52,000
every city in the country. They will approach you. He calls me up two years ago, just can

206
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,200
you come in my office, please? Delta Force card, everything he said I said was, of course

207
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:00,520
I'm right. I know what I'm talking about. This is martial law.

208
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:05,320
Looking back on 2012, I know personally I'm thanking God that my family and I made it

209
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:09,320
through the year from natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer

210
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:13,540
drought to the family hardships brought on by a disastrous economy. Our hearts go out

211
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:17,640

00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:21,880

213
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:26,160
from New York City wrote in following Hurricane Sandy and said, Almost all the grocery stores

214
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:30,400
are closed, but I managed to get my E Foods just in time to be able to help my sister

215
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,520
and my niece. Bottom line, it's better to be prepared 10 years too early and one day

216
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,520
too late.

The leader in lawsuit self-help since 1997. Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered

241
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:35,620
why banks, stock workers, investment advisors want to talk about gold IRAs? They've been

242
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:40,440
available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your

243
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:45,240
retirement. Gold is outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs. If you would like

244
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:51,600
to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237. Don't get left behind by rising inflation

Alex Jones here back live. I'm going to open the phones up on the Super Bowl power outage.

255
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:26,960
What do you think that was all about? I've got some news concerning it, it's pretty amazing.

256
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:33,720
I'm going to get to, even mainstream news is reporting is an Illuminati conspiracy.

257
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:42,180
Because the singer flashes an Illuminati hand sign and then the power goes out. And it's

258
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:48,600
just all part of them extending it out, having more time for ads and getting everybody ready

259
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:55,760
for the power to start going out. In fact, in Europe and worldwide, they have Earth Day

260
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,120
where everybody turns their lights out.

261
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:03,560
For the day, for the evening, for one hour, they have a lot of different special greeny

262
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:09,800
holidays where they want to accustom you to, everybody has their power go out. Because

263
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:14,840
only the government districts are going to have the power. And see, for a new listener

264
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:18,800
it's like, man, is everything a conspiracy with this guy?

265
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:23,080
I have so much knowledge on this, it's very frustrating. I'm not bragging, hey, I have

266
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:28,120
knowledge. It's freaking me out that the general public doesn't have 1 one hundredth of the

267
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:32,000
information I have. Because you're focused on making money and doing your job and trying

268
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,360
to take care of your kids and trying to have a good life.

269
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:39,500
I don't blame you, I get it. You work hard, you want to go watch a football game. You

270
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:43,920
work hard, you want to be left alone. You work hard, you want to go get in your sports

271
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:48,940
car and go drive 100 miles an hour out in the countryside. I get it. You work hard,

272
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:53,800
you want to go out and go water skiing or you want to go out and have some fun, go out

273
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,080
and party.

274
00:25:55,080 --> 00:26:00,140
The problem is we've been taken over and things are going to get very, very bad. But as things

275
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:05,600
get worse and worse, people are going to say, well, let me just have my entertainment. Just

276
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:12,520
leave me alone. In fact, statistics and history shows, as things get worse, people tend to

277
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:16,160
get even more into entertainment and more into escapism.

278
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:26,320
And the social engineers know that. But what they can't get over is tribal images and archetypes

279
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:35,760
and signants, runes of power. And that's what guns are, that's what property is, that's

280
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:42,000
what parenthood is. It's real things like weapons and children and property. This is

281
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,340
all real.

282
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:50,020
And they can't get rid of that last little pieces, the family, men and women, and their

283
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:56,640
desire for one another. Friendship, people standing up for one another. That's why all

284
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,480
the messages are don't stand up for people, screw other people, cheat other people. Get

285
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:05,480
ahead, get ahead, show that you're all atomized and can't come together.

286
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:11,720
I mean, when I get up here and say the Super Bowl power outage looks staged, you have to

287
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:16,520
understand, ladies and gentlemen, that I know. In fact, I wanna do a special report on this.

288
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:21,500
It's just that I wanna do a special report on everything. I wanna document everything

289
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:25,920
and every article I cover. Every one of these 200 articles is probably more than, can we

290
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,320
have a document, guys?

291
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:32,960
There's probably 200 different articles here. Every one of them I could spend three hours

292
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:39,140
on and then give you supporting backup information on each and every one of them, proving why

293
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:45,460
I believe what I believe, why I say what I say, what I'm going over, what I'm breaking

294
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:55,500
down, okay? I mean, here's an example. I have the UN proclamations in the 1960s and 70s

295
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:59,680
saying they wanted to train people to not have electricity and to not expect electricity

296
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:05,260
24 hours a day and to not accept running water and to not accept things.

297
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:11,880
And that the globalist could charge us more money for a gallon of water than for 10,000

298
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:18,200
gallons of it. And that society was set up wrong and that wealth was making us too free

299
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:22,840
and the social engineers were going to lose control of technological development and their

300
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:29,680
global monopoly of power if they didn't bring the general population back into feudal serfdom.

301
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:34,140
And that's why all the trendy resorts and all the trendy restaurants all over the country

302
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:39,020
and other countries I've been to, you go in and they're not low flush toilets. There is

303
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:44,840
no water. They're not low flush urinals. There is no water. And you're at a five star restaurant

304
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:48,980
and the bathroom stinks like a gas station because the urine's going down into a cistern

305
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:54,120
below that gets processed and turned into fertilizer and stuff, okay?

306
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:58,840
They make it trendy to be a slave. Just like the ancient Chinese emperors, they were told

307
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:03,600
it's stylish to not be able to walk. It's stylish to not be able to feed yourself. And

308
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:10,080
the ruling power behind the throne fully took over. This is the system. They tell you it's

309
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:14,360
stylish to be a slave. They tell you it's stylish not to be manly. They tell you it's

310
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,560
stylish not to be a classical mother.

311
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:21,800
They tell you all of this not to empower you but to enslave you. So see, I know this was

312
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:34,200
a stunt. I know in my gut and I know their MO. 99% chance, okay? 99% chance because I

313
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:39,800
happen to remember other stunts where they had official sporting events go dark in the

314
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:46,000
past and I predict next Super Bowl they'll say, we're now going to make this a tradition

315
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,840
to have the power go out. Watch, we come back.

316
00:29:49,840 --> 00:30:00,720
There on the march, the empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

317
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,720
Millions of people are going to get sick this winter from colds, flu and other illnesses.

318
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:09,460
Don't be one of them. Protect yourself with Supernatural Silver, a revolutionary new broad

319
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:14,640
spectrum antibacterial solution. Recent advances in silver technology have resulted in a silver

We are on the march. The empire is on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.

350
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:20,120
All right, finishing up. Before I give out the number and get into some other news, then

351
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:27,320
go to your phone calls. They were billing the Super Bowl as the most green friendly

352
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:32,280
ever. But green friendly for me means not having genetically modified organisms being

353
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:38,000
manufactured by the thousand every year, not having human genetics put into sheep, cows,

354
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:45,320
you name it, so that you can then have cross-species zoological transference of pathogens, bacteria

355
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:50,240
and virus. And it gives rise to dangerous mutations, not having toxic waste dumped in

356
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:56,080
our food supply, not having dangerous experiments going on with any matter.

357
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,680
These are the things that could actually destroy the planet, destroy us. Not carbon dioxide

358
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:07,280
plants breathe, not where it's bad to have electricity, it's bad to flush your toilet.

359
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:12,360
When all your toilet does if you have say a septic system is send it out through a bacteria

360
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:22,640
tank and then sends fertilized water out to your green yard, creating a recycled ecosystem.

361
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:28,160
It's all renewable. Humans are bad, humans are evil. You're saying how do I know this

362
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,160
was staged?

363
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:34,200
Well, I went back and reviewed the video right before it happened. I saw the way they were

364
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:39,520
behaving some of the things they did right when it happened, the way they behaved once

365
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:45,720
it unfolded. Most people obviously weren't in on it, but it's all about to see if they

366
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:48,880
can get away with it.

367
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:54,080
And how do I know this? Well, the UN has called for this. In fact, guys, we use search engine

368
00:34:54,080 --> 00:35:02,160
Enron staged blackouts. And then you all hear about it on Earth Day and World Day and all

369
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:08,280
these other days they have where simultaneously nations turn their lights out.

370
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:11,640
They're getting you trained. And Enron said in its internal memos that came out in the

371
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:18,140
federal trial that, well, we found if we cut the power, it creates the artificial perception

372
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:24,040
of scarcity. The perception so that we can have artificial scarcity. Yeah, there's Wall

373
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,040
Street Journal.

374
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:31,660
Enron linked to California blackouts. Traders said manipulation began energy crisis. Yeah.

375
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:37,080
And then it came out in the federal court. That's from 2002. It came out that they would

376
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:43,840
do it. And some days they'd make $1 billion extra, some weeks $3 or $4 billion extra all

377
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:48,620
over the West Coast, but mainly in California, saying there isn't enough power.

378
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:54,740
There isn't enough power. My gosh, okay, you want power? You went without power for six

379
00:35:54,740 --> 00:36:00,080
hours today, Los Angeles. We're gonna have to charge you more. Give me my power then.

380
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:05,720
All right, it's free market. Truth is they had a glut of power. The truth is they were

381
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:09,560
telling their switching stations, calling them on the phone, because all these people

382
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,340
weren't conspirators.

383
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:16,040
They were just told by Enron that had the contracts over the agreement. Okay, start

384
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:22,540
cutting power over the next 24 hours, cut it down to almost nothing. I mean, they have

385
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:28,060
to build the grid up, have actuaries of how much is gonna be used, prepare and guess with

386
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:32,840
computers. In the old days, they did it with big thick pads of paper, and they would sit

387
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:36,200
there and guess, okay, this time of year, generally this much power gets used.

388
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,360
We know when it gets hot, they're gonna use more air conditioners. We know when it's cold,

389
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:44,600
okay, this many people on average have electric power. They're not using a gas or, okay, we

390
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:48,080
have this much power used last year, we guess there's gonna be that much. And then if there's

391
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:54,000
extra power, it has to then be stored in big giant batteries and other systems.

392
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:01,800
That power is destructive, it will blow things up. They've got it all dialed in. And the

393
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:06,260
Soviets would do this in their satellites to control people. Romanian places, they had

394
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:09,880
policies to just get it to where there were a couple hours of power a day, and then only

395
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:13,840
select factories and government buildings, they had power 24 hours a day.

396
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:17,880
And they're already setting up the actuaries. See, I've studied this issue. I've talked

397
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:23,880
to people that work as engineers in scores of power plants. I've talked to plant managers.

398
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:28,460
I've researched it at every level. I've got a lot of family that works in power plant

399
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:34,480
management and power storage. Yeah, tapes reveal Enron's secret role in California Power

400
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,400
Blackhouse, London Guardian, boom.

401
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:41,960
See, and this is one stinking data point. I have hundreds. Do you know what it's like

402
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:48,240
to be sure of their criminal activity and not be able to stop them? But see, you know

403
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:52,460
they want your guns to enslave you. People saw it worldwide and they've seen it in cities

404
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:55,080
these globalist mafia people run.

405
00:37:55,080 --> 00:38:00,480
So see on that one issue, you know not to trust them so they're not victorious. Even

406
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,040
though they're trying everything they got to go after our guns, and they're trying to

407
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:11,160
launch out of control outside of law purges against gun owners, it still doesn't matter

408
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:16,140
because on one issue, you're not backing down, you're angry, you're upset, and you're not

409
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:19,720
gonna play games, okay?

410
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:24,560
All you've got to do is figure out their scam on every other issue and it's over, okay?

411
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:29,640
It's over. Let me continue. In fact, I'm gonna do a report on this. I could show you right

412
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:37,720
now. It would just take the whole hour. Type in UN calls for controlled blackouts to lower

413
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,200
carbon footprint.

414
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:46,360
Type in carbon footprint is a depression is good for a carbon footprint. You can go read

415
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:52,720
the UN admitting that the mega banks are engineering this, but it's all in academic level above

416
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:58,120
PhD. You don't get taught this stuff at the London School of Economics. You don't get

417
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,720
taught this stuff at Harvard.

418
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:04,000
You don't get taught this stuff at Yale. I've interviewed people. There's only one a year

419
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:10,200
that goes through the special Rockefeller Foundation program that Henry Kissinger was

420
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:15,120
the first graduate of to be a super gopher for them. You don't go through that until

421
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,720
you've got two PhDs and are selected.

422
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:26,880
And I have interviewed one of the people who's got that special above PhD level degree. Francis

423
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:33,760
Boyle, constitutional lawyer. Dr. Boyle, professor, who they've got on a no fly list. He's not

424
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:38,360
even allowed to fly. They hate him so much cuz he turned against him. He got all the

425
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:42,560
way to the highest level, played along with them, and they let him into all of it.

426
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:49,280
This is how it works. Major universities may graduate five of these people a year, okay?

427
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:53,720
And it's Chicago business, it's Yale, it's Harvard, it's Princeton. The University of

428
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:58,520
Texas has got the former NSA head running it. They're hatching them out. And Aaron Dykes

429
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:03,440
got into the political science higher level, not the highest level.

430
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:08,300
But they were wanting to go for his PhD and stuff cuz he had high grades. And he got right

431
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:11,760
up in there and it was, yeah, world government's real. We're gonna get rid of the family, everything

432
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:18,000
else. I mean, my dad got into the lower mid levels of this and they all told him. Folks,

433
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:23,360
this is an absolute 100% fact, okay?

434
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:27,400
They turned the power off at the Super Bowl to get you ready for more power outages. Remember

435
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:32,080
my article two years ago? Thedrudgereport.com picked up and went viral everywhere and the

436
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:36,320
White House, Jay Carney, responded. I guess it was a year and a half ago when he first

437
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:39,840
got in there and replaced the other idiot, Gibbs.

438
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:42,840
And they responded, so that's ridiculous. There's not gonna be rolling blackouts cuz

439
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:46,800
of us. We're not shutting down power plants, even though they already shut down a couple

440
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:51,960
hundred. Texas now has rolling blackouts when it gets colder, when it gets hot. We have

441
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:56,200
to buy the power from Mexico, dirty plants, the globalist don't.

442
00:40:56,200 --> 00:41:00,880
And there it is, depression good for reducing carbon emissions. Bloomberg, that's an Infowars.com

443
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,600
article. But if you click Bloomberg, that blue link right there, it'll show you. And

444
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:12,340
the UN says, use public events in their, pull it up. They say, we will use public events

445
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:17,640
to turn the power off to teach everyone it's good and we will ritualize not having running

446
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,760
water, not having electricity.

447
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:25,200
They're going to turn your electricity off. You're not going to have it. In the actuary

448
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:32,420
agreements in San Francisco and Austin and Okinawa, these sister model UN cities under

449
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:39,000
immunization plans, just go look it up. Austin special model UN city, thousands of pages,

450
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:45,560
UN website. They say the central governing districts and the central governing zoning

451
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:48,040
areas will never lose power.

452
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:52,520
That's why all the elite where I live, doesn't matter there's houses 10 times as big, outside

453
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:56,920
town for cheaper. They move into little bitty houses in Tarrytown. I say little bitty, little

454
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:01,160
bitty for these people, billionaires are down there. They move into three and four and five

455
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:05,960
bedroom houses, because that's where the police protection zone is.

456
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:10,600
You've heard the police calling and confirm this. The police captains know where the special

457
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:15,720
zones are at. Those places will not have their power cut off. The reason they're tearing

458
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:19,160
up the roads and putting in bus lanes and stuff and bike lanes is they're going to shut

459
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,920
everything off in the future.

460
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:26,360
They're not playing games is my point. You understand what it's like to know of this

461
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:31,820
criminal activity? A bunch of seedy slime bags playing God because we stand down and

462
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:39,440
let them run all over us. The UN maps presented in Congress, I'm showing one on screen right

463
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:44,200
now, half the country, right at half, completely off limits.

464
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:49,560
And folks in Burma and other areas, I saw it in 1999. I've got to find it, it was about

465
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:59,280
Asia, and it showed UN zones, biosphere zones, and it showed men with machine guns who shoot

466
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:04,280
anyone that enters them. They kill you if you enter it. They're already doing this in

467
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,560
Africa and Latin America.

468
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:10,900
Look it up, even the New York Times, African people and others and Latin Americans are

469
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:16,300
being killed for UN programs to quote, reclaim land to the earth, kicking people off their

470
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:26,640
ancestral land, forcing them into giant megacities, to then work for two cents an hour. And then

471
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:32,480
the government says, guess what, just get sterilized, do this and that, and we will

472
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:36,800
give you $5,000, the equivalent of what they'd make in three or four or five years, and they

473
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:37,800
do it.

474
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:42,640
You're like, good, sterilize them, there's too many people. You idiots, you idiot yuppies.

475
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:46,660
You're not white racists, cuz that's not what they are. They're on power trips like they're

476
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:51,060
scientists and they've been let in on the program, because it is, everybody's let in

477
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:52,060
on it.

478
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:57,740
You go to any cocktail party, even just mainline people that don't even have their four year

479
00:43:57,740 --> 00:44:02,100
science degree yet, and start talking about, we need to get rid of people, we need to reduce

480
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:07,440
population and they'll start singing from the same sheet of music. Don't you get it,

481
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:11,720
you morons, they're putting it in your food, they're putting it in your water, they're

482
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:15,720
putting it in your air, they're soft killing you as well.

483
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:19,960
They just can't do it as openly and as fast because we have something of a free press

484
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:26,500
left that would report on it. I mean, I remember two years ago, I saw major pro-life sites

485
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:37,360
that are highly respected saying, Pepsi is using aborted fetus body parts to produce

486
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:42,040
specially grown cultured flavor enhancer.

487
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:50,200
It's basically a genetically engineered flavor, they wanna be able to just drop a vial of

488
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:57,960
it into a soup and ferment the flavor, okay? Just like aspartame is E. coli. And I saw

489
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:01,440
that and I said, that's not true, and I went looked it up and it was true. And then the

490
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:06,440
Obama administration ruled for PepsiCo that the shareholders didn't have to be told where

491
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,200
the babies were coming from.

492
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:12,800
And then it all came out, in fact, you can even type in, it happened last year, PepsiCo

493
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:17,880
agrees to stop using fetal tissue. People didn't believe it, I didn't believe it, but

494
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:25,800
actually I should have believed it, I already knew it. They had cloned humans 20 years ago,

495
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:29,600
they just don't call it a human because they kill the baby before it's born.

496
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:35,280
They grow them in artificial wombs and then they say it's not a human because it was changed.

497
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:41,080
They add 1% pig, 1% cow, 1%, look this up, this has already been going on for 20 years.

498
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:47,600
And then it's not a human and it's not a clone, they give it other semantical names and then

499
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:52,900
they suck them dry and use them. Yeah, PepsiCo says it will halt use of aborted fetal cells

500
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:56,360
in flavor research, it's also in the Washington Times.

501
00:45:56,360 --> 00:46:02,480
And they go, technically, we're not feeding you babies, we grow the culture out of the

502
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:07,560
stem cell line from the dead babies. That's right, that's right, for whatever reason,

503
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:14,080
I guess I gotta admit veal tastes really good. Something about baby flesh tastes pretty good.

504
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:19,160
When I go out and I go hunting, if I'm gonna shoot something, it isn't a big buck, I'm

505
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:26,360
gonna shoot a yearling doe and I'm gonna take it and I'm gonna have it cut into steaks.

506
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:32,800
If I hunt, if I hunt to eat it, if I see a big ugly old jackrabbit, I'm not going, that

507
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:38,120
thing's gonna have fleas all over them and it tastes like, but if I see a little fluffy

508
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:43,800
jackrabbit hopping around, my 22-250 is gonna shoot you about 200 yards and I'm gonna eat

509
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:44,800
you.

510
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,920
Back when I had time to be a woodsman and do such things like that, my true love, it's

511
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:54,000
any man's true love, you ever go out and do it. And so it's sick, you're eating a flavor

512
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:01,560
enhancement from a baby, from a baby and you don't even care. Just like they have suicide

513
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:06,680
nets, not just at Foxconn, but dozens of other, I mean, I don't know, I looked at them something

514
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:11,760
like 30 major companies have built in China around their dorm suicide nets.

515
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:15,760
And they're saying, don't worry, Foxconn said, we're just gonna go to robots, but they still

516
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:20,860
need human technicians to work on the robots. See, they don't need us, they don't want us,

517
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:25,600
they took the world over through fraud and they're coming for everyone.

518
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:31,800
And they've had other global soccer games, type in power turned off, lights go dark at

519
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:37,080
soccer game to mark Earth Day, just type that in, I wanna show them. This is the program,

520
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:42,600
I know them, they have blueprints, they have handbooks. And so once their robot armies

521
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:49,440
are in place, robot engineers, robot sewer repair, robot street repair, robot security,

522
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:54,480
robot combat, once that's all in, and we're only talking five to ten years, they're gonna

523
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:59,040
probably let it go a little bit further than that to make sure all systems are good.

524
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:02,880
They're going to launch a Skynet attack on us, but it's not gonna be nuclear, it's gonna

525
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:08,800
be biological and chemical. And that it's humans running Skynet, okay? And again, you

526
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:13,840
can pull this up in the 70s, the Pentagon called it and it's actually in my book, that's

527
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:18,600
out of print now, but it's on prisonplanet.tv and m4news.com. They actually call it Skynet

528
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:20,840
and a control grid.

529
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:26,560
See, people see this info who are in Hollywood and in between the CIA and Hollywood that's

530
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:30,680
like two peas in a pod, and then they put the culture out to get you ready. But it's

531
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:36,120
not machines coming commanded by machines, it is elite globalists who believe they're

532
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:38,200
going to merge with the machines.

533
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:44,240
They believe the evolutionary path has already been predestined, they've chosen this path.

534
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:49,200
They have chosen the best possible path to immortality is cybernetic merger. And they're

535
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:55,160
offering the greatest intelligentsia of the world entree into that system if they will

536
00:48:55,160 --> 00:49:01,080
serve it. Number one, you reap what you sow, you're not going to get this immortality.

537
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:05,160
Number two, it's horrible what you're doing. And number three, you can't trust the globalists

538
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:11,400
that engineered this thing. You think they're going to let people like you stay around that

539
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:16,960
are a lot smarter than them? Do you think they're going to keep you around? You are

540
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,800
gravely mistaken. This is not good.

541
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:25,960
We should offer the technology to everyone. We should be honest about what's going on

542
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:33,200
and we should have giant global initiatives that are accepted at the nation state level

543
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:39,220
and accepted and voted on by the people of goals of off world colonies and bring out

544
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:41,720
all this technology and be honest about it.

545
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:45,900
And we can people the stars together. But I'm telling you that that decision has been

546
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:49,880
cut off. That is not happening. That is not the direction we're going. You're slated for

547
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:54,760
death. And as soon as their grids in place, they're going to release the bio weapons and

548
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:57,760
the chemical weapons and all of you people that have served the system and think you're

549
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:58,760
part of it.

550
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:05,560
You're going to die. I hope you understand that's the program. That's the plan. And I've

551
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:09,160
warned you and I've warned you and it's why I'm not worried about getting killed or being

552
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:16,340
put in prison. There's no future if we don't turn this around. And we need to have an intervention

553
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:22,280
with ourselves and realize this system and what people think about you and all the TV

554
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:23,360
and the culture.

555
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:30,600
It means nothing. Sitting there, I brought by a party last night when I was invited to

556
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:36,720
it was a nice group of people. And I just watched him and a lot of more listeners. Super

557
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:42,240
Bowl party was at a restaurant. They shut down for the party. And I watched all these

558
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:43,240
nice people.

559
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:51,000
Steiner Steakhouse. And I watched all these people sit there and watch the watch the the

560
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:56,920
fake thing rolled out for them, whereas they all were having a lot more fun before we stop

561
00:50:56,920 --> 00:51:02,640
and sort of watching the game. Well, it doesn't matter. Attention gardeners and patriots drought

562
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:07,320
conditions in our nation's heartland and massive Federal Reserve debt monetizing are creating

591
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:23,340
in for one segment we've got the author of the fixes in he says one of the most corrupt

592
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:30,160
outfits is the NFL staging things and he's been in the FBI files it's been documented

593
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:33,780
the question is how much is staged well how much will you put up with he's going to pop

594
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:37,600
in to give us his take on the power outage with the game in general because if I talk

595
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:44,080
about the Super Bowl and then use it as a way to get people to think about larger issues

596
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:50,880
we can take a globalist tool of propaganda and actually turn it around against them here's

597
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:56,960
something I want to get across to you the decision has been made at MIT the United Nations

598
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:03,040
the club of Rome the Bilderberg group anyone who reads science magazines knows this 15

599
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:07,660
years ago I was reading white papers where they said this was the plan and those were

600
00:55:07,660 --> 00:55:13,640
white papers from decades before in some cases but I'd never seen it in Scientific American

601
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:21,200
I'd never seen it in the Journal of Nature I'd never seen it in MIT magazine now they're

602
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:25,260
going no there will be no need for humans and we don't know what to do with you and

603
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:29,380
everything will be robotic and the elites are going to merge with machines and the decision

604
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:34,320
has basically been that we're not even going to have humans deployed to space and the manned

605
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:43,240
space program is over and everything is robots that is a decision that humans are obsolete

606
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:48,160
humans are a failure humans are a joke and the globalists are going to take full control

607
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:54,520
of human evolution in their words and think of what a total revolution that is where they

608
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:59,560
just ignore what we want they ignore what we say they put out a fake Hollywood sports

609
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:07,440
system they suck everyone into it while above us a technocratic matrix engineer core is

610
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:14,800
trying to build a matrix we're not in total false reality yet they put out fake shotgun

611
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:19,720
photos they do Illuminati signs right before they turn the power off you know Janet Jackson

612
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:24,120
it was an accident my breast came out with the Illuminati Sun sign on her I mean all

613
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:29,880
staged oh was it staged gee did a bear go in the woods and go to the bathroom do fish

614
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:36,420
live in the water I mean again they do it all to just exercise authority over us where

615
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:40,280
they publicly run al-qaeda and admit they do but say you've got to give your liberties

616
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:46,720
up because of al-qaeda they just publicly do all of this to where even those of us that

617
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:51,560
know it's going on it's kind of like oh well I knew TSA checkpoints were coming oh there's

618
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:57,760

619
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:02,800

a gun and call the SWAT team a Hello Kitty well that's ridiculous it's meant to be ridiculous

623
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:26,600
it's meant to just turn everything on its head until everything if the government's

624
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:30,680
totally secret but you have no privacy that's backwards government's supposed to be wide

661
01:01:28,220 --> 01:01:32,060
then in the third hour i am just going i've got to go through all this news i mean it

662
01:01:32,060 --> 01:01:38,300
also gets to me that i read all this stuff and scan over it and then i don't uh ever

663
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:43,060
cover but about i don't know 10 of it i've got to get to what i think happened with chris

664
01:01:43,060 --> 01:01:50,420
kyle the uh i mean how crazy is come on you know that smells come on come on the timing

665
01:01:50,420 --> 01:01:58,740
that guy of all people i mean what is the probability something's going on um or maybe

666
01:01:58,740 --> 01:02:02,360
it is that they've had people serve five six seven ters and put them on psychotropics this

667
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:06,300
guy was under psychiatric care and the government did it to him that way either i mean it's

668
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:12,000
government whether they staged it or not i mean we see extraordinary craziness happen

669
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:17,460
because it's crazy and it's going to get crazier all the more reason we should have water filters

670
01:02:17,460 --> 01:02:22,060
guns be prepared try to move to the suburbs at least try to move out in the country if

671
01:02:22,060 --> 01:02:27,820
you can that's what all the elite are doing but when we do it oh it's weird uh he he's

672
01:02:27,820 --> 01:02:33,700
he's got guns and he's he's concerned about his security and uh and they even told their

673
01:02:33,700 --> 01:02:39,140
kids don't trust the government i'm sorry i i don't trust the government anymore because

674
01:02:39,140 --> 01:02:43,520
at the top it's run by bad people and more and more i see it trickling down more and

675
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:48,540
more even if people in the government don't like it they're following unconstitutional

676
01:02:48,540 --> 01:02:58,140
orders they're following unconstitutional orders

677
01:02:58,140 --> 01:03:05,780
and i understand sometimes it isn't a perfect world or you know the nobody's perfect but

678
01:03:05,780 --> 01:03:12,540
i mean the system is really corrupt and don't you instinctively working for the system not

679
01:03:12,540 --> 01:03:17,000
want your kids and grandkids growing up in this i mean look i've said this a million

680
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:25,940
times you'll probably never meet your great great grandson or daughter but if you could

681
01:03:25,940 --> 01:03:28,940
wouldn't you love them as much as your son or daughter today or your grandchildren today

682
01:03:28,940 --> 01:03:34,440
you know you would in fact there'd be a strange pride it wouldn't i mean i know my grandmother

683
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:43,580
almost 90 years old my last grandparent living still sharp as a tack

684
01:03:43,580 --> 01:03:49,420
she really gets satisfaction you can see it in her eyes looking at her great-grandchildren

685
01:03:49,420 --> 01:03:59,180
think about it that's the woman who had my mother who had me and now i have children

686
01:03:59,180 --> 01:04:04,280
but if you think about it i touch my mother my mother touches her mother it's my children

687
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:10,520
came out of my genetics my wife and i and then i come from my mother she comes from

688
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:14,820
her mother she comes from her mother she comes from her mother and and you're only talking

689

690

the days of christ we are touching those that you know that lived under the chin dynasty

692
01:04:30,420 --> 01:04:38,620
in china you are touching the the old uh african kings if you're from africa you you are directly

693
01:04:38,620 --> 01:04:45,380
that you are these people you are literally their flesh and blood the love they transferred

694
01:04:45,380 --> 01:04:51,820
magically it is spiritual i mean good magic like magic in the world beauty wonder they

695
01:04:51,820 --> 01:04:57,180
are transferring that down in through the generations in a direct line that's why this

731
01:08:38,300 --> 01:08:46,220
2013 we've got a guest coming up the author of the Fix is In Brian Toohey is going to

732
01:08:46,220 --> 01:08:50,620
be coming on to get his take on the Super Bowl the power outage that looked pretty darn

733
01:08:50,620 --> 01:09:01,840
staged even Yahoo Sports says did Illuminati sign was it a signal that it the power was

734
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:06,040
to go out how do you pronounce that woman's name I'm embarrassed I don't even know the

735
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:11,100
name of these pop idiots Beyonce that's what I thought did Beyonce flash and Illuminati

736
01:09:11,100 --> 01:09:18,400
sign why did the Superdome power go out your Super Bowl mysteries solved so we're going

737
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:24,980
to be going over that and again all a conspiracy theorist is now is someone who questions known

738
01:09:24,980 --> 01:09:31,000
liars in corporate globalist media and in a corrupt government now because people lost

739
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:35,500
total faith in the system it doesn't mean that everybody out there with their own theory

740
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:39,740
is right it doesn't mean all the alternative media is right it doesn't mean that I'm always

741
01:09:39,740 --> 01:09:47,440
right we're all imperfect creatures but we know the system has an authoritarian bent

742
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:54,060
and a goal that it's pushing Reuters report contradicts Obama skeet shooting photo story

743
01:09:54,060 --> 01:09:59,500
said Obama played golf on August 4th retired for dinner and I gotta say Cass Sunstein the

744
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:03,880
White House said we'll do cognitive infiltration we'll put out our own ridiculous conspiracy

745
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:08,560
theories that are actually true but don't matter to just get everyone fighting over

746
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:15,540
something and this doesn't look like any shotgun blast I've ever seen it looks like a smoke

747
01:10:15,540 --> 01:10:20,380
pop gun or something and I'm not saying Obama would you shoot a gun Obama's all about guns

748
01:10:20,380 --> 01:10:24,940
he's a gangster he's a globalist but just like they put out a fake birth certificate

749
01:10:24,940 --> 01:10:30,380
to get us all debating about it and then it turns out no he really was probably born in

750
01:10:30,380 --> 01:10:36,220
Hawaii but to a famous communist and they did cover up where he came from and have sealed

751
01:10:36,220 --> 01:10:40,540
his records and he had all these other different names and his mother was into all this weird

752
01:10:40,540 --> 01:10:48,300
stuff and that's why they say in his Harvard dissertation and when he was the head of the

753
01:10:48,300 --> 01:10:55,120
law review and just scores of publications he said for 17 years he was born in Kenya

754
01:10:55,120 --> 01:11:00,100
his wife said it and all that is to tantalize us they know that they throw that out they

755
01:11:00,100 --> 01:11:07,540
know that's a lie there's so many lies you can't get to the truth because it's just lies

756
01:11:07,540 --> 01:11:14,260
on lies on lies on lies during the break we had Fox News on out there and I saw Obama

757
01:11:14,260 --> 01:11:19,580
getting off Air Force One with Al Franken and I saw the Air Force officer walk over

758
01:11:19,580 --> 01:11:24,700
and greet them and everyone's sycophantically looking at them and groveling and Obama's

759
01:11:24,700 --> 01:11:30,660
getting off on the narcissistic power trip Al Franken is shaking with pleasure I remember

760
01:11:30,660 --> 01:11:37,860
reading about how Dennis Kucinich sold out on Obamacare and a bunch of other stuff so

761
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:45,260
that so that he could get a ride on Air Force One I mean are we peacocks or are we humans

762
01:11:45,260 --> 01:11:50,020
are we preening sycophantic peacocks I guess a lot of us are and I looked at everyone there

763
01:11:50,020 --> 01:11:54,620
they they were just getting off on the power getting off and the Air Force officer was

764
01:11:54,620 --> 01:12:00,840
Mr. President a bunch of sycophants and the Marines were getting off on it and Franken

765
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:08,240
it was all a big joke what a big armored Cadillac and a Air Force One so you can shell out humanity

766
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:15,220
and feel powerful about yourselves the stars are in the sky the universe incredible beauty

767
01:12:15,220 --> 01:12:23,300
your family your children everything good literature art these politicians and people

768
01:12:23,300 --> 01:12:28,340
they're not rock stars you know the reason people have admired literature and artists

769
01:12:28,340 --> 01:12:34,140
and actors and philosophers is because they do offer something beautiful music beautiful

770
01:12:34,140 --> 01:12:40,300
plays ideas they express things that touch our soul and build us up Shakespeare deserves

771
01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:46,500
to be admired you may say they're you know evil or whatever it doesn't matter the point

772
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:54,220
is it's beautiful things like Led Zeppelin Beethoven and and different things touch different

773
01:12:54,220 --> 01:13:03,280
people that I would be giddy to be around somebody like Robert Plant not because he's

774
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:14,220
a celebrity but because his voice has touched me so many times do you understand the difference

775
01:13:14,220 --> 01:13:24,820
and but then it's strange when you admire someone you then don't want to meet them because

776
01:13:24,820 --> 01:13:33,560
that would that would damage the the the the spiritual relationship understand the difference

777
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:40,100
of what I'm saying here like I know where Robert Plant goes every week at a certain

778
01:13:40,100 --> 01:13:45,500
time here in Austin I would never go there to try to meet him and I'm not some big fan

779
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:49,260
of Robert Plant it's just I'm trying to think who do what I want to meet I would want to

780
01:13:49,260 --> 01:13:57,340
meet somebody like Mother Teresa who helped people I would want to meet Ernest Borgnine

781
01:13:57,340 --> 01:14:03,940
which I had a chance to do was too busy and didn't do because I'm just not into it who

782
01:14:03,940 --> 01:14:08,740
Ted Knight I would love there you go I think I've said that Ted Knight you don't know who

783
01:14:08,740 --> 01:14:16,380
Ted Knight is oh don't fire me Lou look I said I'd go to your calls the point is that

784
01:14:16,380 --> 01:14:20,060
we're selling out for nothing in fact you guys actually taped it can you show when they

785
01:14:20,060 --> 01:14:25,940
get to the bottom of the game a gangplank walking down the steps they're off Air Force

786
01:14:25,940 --> 01:14:32,180
One and just the the the the faces they're making again if you're a radio listener you

787
01:14:32,180 --> 01:14:35,340
obviously can't see this but I'm showing it to TV viewers who are watching over info wars

788
01:14:35,340 --> 01:14:42,180
news.com and it just shows all of the satisfaction and I know the looks on faces those aren't

789
01:14:42,180 --> 01:14:47,580
looks of oh it's an exciting day or we just heard a funny joke or we're going somewhere

790
01:14:47,580 --> 01:14:53,340
really cool it's like we're with the cool president who's jogging we're all out here

791
01:14:53,340 --> 01:14:59,860
in the power structure you know we're I mean the Secret Service are all into their get-ups

792
01:14:59,860 --> 01:15:04,020
they're they're they're black trench coats and their submachine guns under them and see

793
01:15:04,020 --> 01:15:08,340
they don't like the fact that we have guns you see they want the exclusivity of having

794
01:15:08,340 --> 01:15:11,980
electricity and you're not going to have it they're going to turn your electricity off

795
01:15:11,980 --> 01:15:15,500
but in the government district they're going to have it they're going to be allowed to

796
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:20,780
have kids you're not they're going to go places and fly over you and fly over country while

797
01:15:20,780 --> 01:15:25,780
you cling your Bibles because you're not going to have your guns they say you're bitter clingers

798
01:15:25,780 --> 01:15:35,660
you don't like them you're not in on the delusion and it's so incredibly empty it's so incredibly

799
01:15:35,660 --> 01:15:40,980
empty that's why I can't bring myself even though we're doing it building big fancy sets

800
01:15:40,980 --> 01:15:45,780
and going and getting fitted for a bunch of fancy suits but I've got to do it because

801
01:15:45,780 --> 01:15:50,620
if it'll get people to listen to what I'm saying so I can warn them I will wear a waiter

802
01:15:50,620 --> 01:15:55,820
outfit I will wear a high signet power in fact I was even thinking about it and then

803
01:15:55,820 --> 01:16:00,500
was amazed to see another talk show us do it where we could build a fake Oval Office

804
01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:04,340
and sit there and Brian broadcast from that and then everyone would fall down and do whatever

805
01:16:04,340 --> 01:16:10,060
I said but I don't want to manipulate through symbols I want you to become aware of the

806
01:16:10,060 --> 01:16:15,800
manipulation and become really conscious so that humanity can be risen up instead of driven

807
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:24,640
down but just watching the faces of the just cringing with shaking with the power trip

808
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:30,980
of we're exclusive we're here we've made it we've arrived and I've noticed all these sycophants

809
01:16:30,980 --> 01:16:36,580
is the same looks in North Korea and I've watched old film reels of other dictatorships

810
01:16:36,580 --> 01:16:41,140
and things going back a hundred years the people all look at the dictator or look at

811
01:16:41,140 --> 01:16:45,620
the puppet because through that they get their reflective power they have people that then

812
01:16:45,620 --> 01:16:52,940
under them look at them with this weird sycophantic strangeness I can't stand it people do it

813
01:16:52,940 --> 01:17:03,140
to me and it's just like pathetic I mean I would have loved to have met Stanley

814
01:17:03,140 --> 01:17:12,320
Kubrick I would have loved to have met Ernest Hemingway not that I even agree with his politics

815
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:18,140
but his writing touched my heart his writing told things that I'd experience a different

816
01:17:18,140 --> 01:17:31,780
ways and I communed with his soul the truth is humans aren't pathetic failed creatures

817
01:17:31,780 --> 01:17:36,260
one side of this is but the globalists want to put us artificially into that we need to

818
01:17:36,260 --> 01:17:40,140
reach for the stars ladies and gentlemen all right I got a bunch of news coming up I said

819
01:17:40,140 --> 01:17:44,060
I'd go to your calls Eric in Colorado you're on the air you want to comment on the Super

820
01:17:44,060 --> 01:17:55,460
Bowl go ahead he dropped off okay let's go to Darren in Florida news reports and daughters

821

meds okay go ahead well Alex can you hear me yes I can yes I wanted to first talk about

822
01:18:02,140 --> 01:18:09,060
Chris Kyle if I might the sniper go ahead okay sir because of what's been going on and

823
01:18:09,060 --> 01:18:13,620
listening to you and thanks ditto from what everybody says a great job you're doing I've

824
01:18:13,620 --> 01:18:17,940
begun to see a lot of things I hadn't really paid attention to before and my son who's

825
01:18:17,940 --> 01:18:22,340
in the ROTC called me late Saturday night to tell me about Chris Kyle I just couldn't

826
01:18:22,340 --> 01:18:27,500
believe it so yesterday morning before church I got up and started looking at all the all

827
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:32,220
the news the local news paying very good attention to the local news that I could and I started

828
01:18:32,220 --> 01:18:35,780
noticing some inconsistencies right off and I wanted to review them real quick with you

829
01:18:35,780 --> 01:18:43,340
if I could and your listeners one the initial reports were saying that the suspect was was

830
01:18:43,340 --> 01:18:48,300
witnessed they heard gunshots about between three thirty four o'clock and then they saw

831
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:53,260
someone driving off in a truck but no one actually saw the suspect shoot him this the

832
01:18:53,260 --> 01:18:58,340
second news thing came later saying that a hunter came to the lodge at five o'clock and

833
01:18:58,340 --> 01:19:05,020
found him dead well that's a pretty big inconsistency right there even more important the initial

834
01:19:05,020 --> 01:19:11,500
reports on fox five news and I listed the news but that's immaterial stated that he

835
01:19:11,500 --> 01:19:16,860
was apprehended on a stretch of highway I believe it was I-35 by Camp Wisdom Road and

836
01:19:16,860 --> 01:19:20,960
they showed they showed the cameras there on the police cars in the dark with the lights

837
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:26,340
flashing however just like Sandy Hook they were not allowed to go up and view the person

838
01:19:26,340 --> 01:19:29,820
that they had in custody in the vehicle they said they got him out of the truck he's in

839
01:19:29,820 --> 01:19:35,820
the vehicle but the news persons were not allowed to show the guy's face on the camera

840
01:19:35,820 --> 01:19:40,220
listen listen the whole thing's suspicious what's the chance that Chris Kyle who's definitely

841
01:19:40,220 --> 01:19:45,680
involved in psyops against the American people but highly decorated ends up getting killed

842
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:50,740
the whole thing is very very very suspicious I'm gonna come back and let you finish those

843
01:19:50,740 --> 01:19:54,780
points then we'll go to all the rest of the callers we got Nick in Ireland who wants to

01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:23,280
deadly sniper in US history self-billed a guy who in his book I'm not trying to run

893
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:26,800
a dead guy down but you know I've had my problems and I've talked to Chris Kyle at length

894
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:32,940
and being sued by Ventura he admitted in his book that he had lied to people about other

895
01:24:32,940 --> 01:24:37,800
stuff changed his story about Ventura later said it was outside nobody had basically seen

896
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:43,640
it he has no witnesses Ventura has all these witnesses that it never happened the lawsuit

897
01:24:43,640 --> 01:24:50,480
was going forward and this guy was high up and he was published by a division of News

898
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:59,760
Corp it was going to come out who put him up to this this psi up against Ventura and

899
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:04,320
I talked to him at length on the Opie and Anthony show and he sounded like a nice guy

900
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:09,720
on the surface and I don't know if he was set up I don't know what happened but the

901
01:25:09,720 --> 01:25:15,040
fact that he's killed and there's no witnesses and I looked up this lodge hundreds of people

902
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:21,720
are there at any one time very suspicious that nobody saw it on a Saturday at three

903
01:25:21,720 --> 01:25:27,680
thirty in the afternoon yeah a lot of stuff and then you find the classic PTSD Marine

904
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:34,720
at his house and I guess he'll come out and say he did it I mean we know the government

905
01:25:34,720 --> 01:25:38,960
got the underwear bomber on the plane that came out in Congress we know they order to

906
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:43,800
stand down on seven seven we know they ran drills of the exact same trains being bombed

907
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:53,160
at the exact same time and exact same locations so again they have a history of this yes you're

908
01:25:53,160 --> 01:25:56,920
not wrong to say they could have staged it because if they staged other mass shootings

909
01:25:56,920 --> 01:26:02,100
Operation Northwoods describes how to do it and how to even blame patsies just type in

910
01:26:02,100 --> 01:26:06,640
Operation Northwoods you'll be at the Library of Congress and you can read a what twelve

911
01:26:06,640 --> 01:26:12,200
page declassified memorandum green-lighted by LL M and sir chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff

912
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:18,520
to JFK's desk who vetoed it and then Bobby came back this has since been declassified

913
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:23,840
it's even on frontline on PBS I've read this it was declassified about 15 years ago but

914
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:27,640
it came out a few years ago mainstream news you can look it up Bobby Kennedy wanted to

915
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:36,080
run a false flag against Nicaragua also they talked about bombing the Honduran Embassy

916
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:40,140
and blaming it on the Honduran government don't believe me just type RFK wanted to run

917
01:26:40,140 --> 01:26:49,040
false flag against Honduras and Nicaragua look it up so yeah they do this stuff they're

918
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:54,240
the people that do this out of thousands of graduate seals the last decade thousands and

919
01:26:54,240 --> 01:26:59,900
thousands it happens to this guy come on and seal team six the helicopter with 23 of them

920
01:26:59,900 --> 01:27:04,160
which they never put and said they were suspicious the mission was weird they weren't told where

921
01:27:04,160 --> 01:27:08,960
they were going they always basically are there was no planning this came out they were

922
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:14,080
told get on the helicopter and we were told more evidence they were killed they went to

923
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:19,680
save Army Rangers pinned down turned out that wasn't true see when they have a PR thing

924
01:27:19,680 --> 01:27:25,000
like yeah Pat Tillman was charging up an al-qaeda hill taking out al-qaeda turns out they murdered

925
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:29,440
him but private Lynch was charged into the enemy territory at the convoy turned out she

926
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:33,780
was cowering in fear rest of her unit fought the Iraqis the unit started speaking outs they

927
01:27:33,780 --> 01:27:38,840
killed four of them in one week car accidents shot in the back of the head one guy was barbecuing

928
01:27:38,840 --> 01:27:44,400
in Phoenix and a guy pops up in a black head to toe black uniform double taps him in the

929
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:48,920
head at about 30 yards away and disappears and the police are like oh it's no big deal

930
01:27:48,920 --> 01:27:53,520
you know guy just pops up in a ninja outfit double taps you in the head that's not a government

931
01:27:53,520 --> 01:28:01,700
sniper or anything that's just exact training precision kill and private Lynch she went

932
01:28:01,700 --> 01:28:06,840
public I said you better go public or you're dead I don't know if she got the warning she

933
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:09,920
came out three days later after those four people got killed in her unit that were speaking

934
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:13,960
out she said it's all fake Pentagon told me to lie Jerry Bruckheimer was producing it

935
01:28:13,960 --> 01:28:18,000
Jerry Bruckheimer was scripting and telling him what to say and what to do when they did

936
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:24,880
the fake raid on the hospital he was on a sat connection video sat telling the commander

937
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:31,240
what to do on that raid how to stage it as she hid underneath the gurney three days after

938
01:28:31,240 --> 01:28:36,140
the Iraqi Republican Guard had pulled out three days after the doctors had come and

939
01:28:36,140 --> 01:28:41,320
said hey this area is open come she's here they sent people found it was true pulled

940
01:28:41,320 --> 01:28:46,240
back Jerry Bruckheimer directed the whole thing that's on record BBC even admitted it

941
01:28:46,240 --> 01:28:51,800
now there's the BBC admitting and they just meant as a footnote oh by the way it was directed

942
01:28:51,800 --> 01:29:00,280
by Jerry Bruckheimer directed by the director of Black Hawk Down now you think things might

943
01:29:00,280 --> 01:29:04,080
be fake I don't know caller go ahead and finish your point we only got a minute it's just

944
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:08,480
and that's only the tip of the iceberg go ahead Alex it's just like you said you know

945
01:29:08,480 --> 01:29:13,080
then then the police found him at his home and they had footage of the cops by Holmes

946
01:29:13,080 --> 01:29:16,320
all in a row with the police car they were at the tape around it so which was he was

947
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:20,200

1030
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:06,160
they should do it get aggressive ladies and gentlemen get a fighting spirit think that

1031
01:37:06,160 --> 01:37:10,320
we can win realize we can win and then get out there and we're going to take down the

1032
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:16,360
globalist it's understanding that we don't have a choice and it's exhilarating to stand

1033
01:37:16,360 --> 01:37:20,600
up against tyranny don't let it crush you down don't make it let you feel like you don't

1034
01:37:20,600 --> 01:37:25,760
have any power you've got incredible power that's why they're scared of you and ninety-nine

1035
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:31,080
percent of the people that serve evil are compartmentalized and don't even know it sometimes

1036
01:37:31,080 --> 01:37:34,800
it's easier to wake up somebody who actually works on the inside than the outside because

1037
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:40,880
they know it's true police are the easiest to wake up because they listen and they know

1038
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:43,840
man this guy knows what he's talking about how does he know all this this is what I've

1039
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:48,760
done for 17 years I know what you're going to be told before you get told it I know all

1040
01:37:48,760 --> 01:37:54,640
the training the programs the brainwashing all of it okay military people this show is

1041
01:37:54,640 --> 01:38:00,280
incredibly popular with the military unbelievably so it blows me away anytime I walk into a

1042
01:38:00,280 --> 01:38:05,040
restaurant there's troops almost every time they come over in our listeners and I and

1043
01:38:05,040 --> 01:38:10,280
they tell me how their whole unit listens and all bass listens and how I'm banned and

1044
01:38:10,280 --> 01:38:13,400
how they tell them don't listen so everybody starts listening that's been going on for

1045
01:38:13,400 --> 01:38:17,800
like 15 years I'm gonna go to our guests and then your calls I'm gonna go to Brendan and

1046
01:38:17,800 --> 01:38:21,640
Donna and Eric and Eric and Derek we're gonna get to all of you our guest is just on for

1047
01:38:21,640 --> 01:38:27,200
10 minutes with us the point is is that we've got a chance to really hurt the globalist

1048
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:31,920
and by the grace of God and your prayers I'm still alive and because there's a lot of good

1049
01:38:31,920 --> 01:38:37,800
people in the system as well who've been compartmentalized we've got to get those compartmentalization

1050
01:38:37,800 --> 01:38:43,580
membranes those bulkheads out of there so people can see for miles and miles not just

1051
01:38:43,580 --> 01:38:47,600
what's right in front of them what's being shoved in front of them you got blinders on

1052
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:51,400
and they just shove under the tiny little blinder what you're allowed to see we need

1053
01:38:51,400 --> 01:38:57,880
to get people seeing all around them we need to believe in humanity again God's creations

1054
01:38:57,880 --> 01:39:02,200
we need to know God made us in his image to be leaders and builders not to be slaves of

1055
01:39:02,200 --> 01:39:08,760
the devil in this system all right now that said we're gonna go to our guest I interviewed

1056
01:39:08,760 --> 01:39:12,320
him a few months ago people really asked us to have him back so he is back the fix is

1057
01:39:12,320 --> 01:39:18,720
in the showbiz manipulation of the NFL Major League Baseball NBA NHL and NASCAR and more

1058
01:39:18,720 --> 01:39:23,280
and when I asked him what's the most corrupt is it boxing he said no not really it's probably

1059
01:39:23,280 --> 01:39:30,960
basketball and again it is getting more and more corrupt because it is the new religion

1060
01:39:30,960 --> 01:39:38,040
and people say don't touch my religion it is just unbelievable and we saw the power

1061
01:39:38,040 --> 01:39:44,800
go off last night and you know they're saying this moment of electrifying football comedy

1062
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:48,880
brought to you by the greenest game in Super Bowl history and they're getting you used

1063
01:39:48,880 --> 01:39:53,600
to it well green energy goes off but it's for the earth and they have global earth day

1064
01:39:53,600 --> 01:39:57,360
and earth hour and all these other days turn your power off they've had other sporting

1065
01:39:57,360 --> 01:40:02,340
events where they turn it off on purpose Enron got caught turning power off to condition

1066
01:40:02,340 --> 01:40:06,800
people that there's not enough power so everyone will accept higher power prices all over the

1067
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:12,220
country power prices are going up and all over the world they precipitate power prices

1068
01:40:12,220 --> 01:40:18,440
going up by turning the power off on purpose to create the perception of scarcity it is

1069
01:40:18,440 --> 01:40:23,600
a mass hoax and I believe from knowing what I know and I covered it last hour that this

1070
01:40:23,600 --> 01:40:31,900
was probably staged I don't know Brian Toohey's take on this but we're going to get his take

1071
01:40:31,900 --> 01:40:36,940
he's the author of the fixes in the showbiz manipulators of sports recognizes America's

1072
01:40:36,940 --> 01:40:44,600
leading expert on game fixing and sports he's been interviewed by everything XM ESPN you

1073
01:40:44,600 --> 01:40:50,840
name it this show Coast to Coast AM with George Norie you name it and he joins us and of course

1074
01:40:50,840 --> 01:40:55,120
sports is used to have little kids from Sandy Hook to demonize the Second Amendment exploit

1075
01:40:55,120 --> 01:40:59,560
them and to have ads running against the Second Amendment it's like the running man in the

1076
01:40:59,560 --> 01:41:04,800
Stephen King novel the running man that got turned into a movie the short story that's

1077
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:10,480
what it is sports has always been the heart of the Nazi regime the heart of the Soviet

1078
01:41:10,480 --> 01:41:15,920
regime the heart of the Roman regime the heart of society's manipulating people it's the

1079
01:41:15,920 --> 01:41:22,480
big grand pageant so the globalists the controllers can inject their propaganda I'm not even saying

1080
01:41:22,480 --> 01:41:27,680
sport if you're in sports they're great I think sports are the best thing for children

1081
01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:32,160
I think they're one of the few wholesome things left but at the top it's rotten at the top

1082
01:41:32,160 --> 01:41:40,000
it's disgusting at the at the top it's Lance Armstrong it's a dirty joke well the Bible

1083
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:44,360
says wickedness is in high places so of the book the fixes in available discounted at

1084
01:41:44,360 --> 01:41:48,800
info or shop calm support the author support us get the truth out he joins us now what

1085
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:53,660
was your take overall first on the Super Bowl and then the blackout did you see any any

1086
01:41:53,660 --> 01:41:57,440
signs there you know one team's winning and then the blackout happens and then the momentum

1087
01:41:57,440 --> 01:42:01,800
changes to me that's not where the real fixes would be but you're the expert Brian good

1088
01:42:01,800 --> 01:42:06,680
to have you it's good to be on again Alex good to hear from you with the Super Bowl

1089
01:42:06,680 --> 01:42:10,160
before we get into that quick I don't know did you happen to see the sports page of the

1090
01:42:10,160 --> 01:42:15,520
New York Times today at all no I didn't okay there's a big thing in soccer which is the

1091
01:42:15,520 --> 01:42:20,280
world's game literally the world's game most popular game in the world they had a big announcement

1092
01:42:20,280 --> 01:42:26,160
regarding over probably 600 different soccer matches that have been fixed worldwide recently

1093
01:42:26,160 --> 01:42:30,800
and they think it's all pinpointed perhaps to one guy in Singapore and I mean these are

1094
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:34,800
literally soccer matches that every letter full all the way up to the World Cup which

1095
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:38,760
is even bigger than the Super Bowl and so I hear from a lot of people say well you know

1096
01:42:38,760 --> 01:42:43,400
you can't fix the game well here's a little proof that games have been fixed literally

1097
01:42:43,400 --> 01:42:48,240
worldwide literally in the biggest sport and the biggest stage out there and yet people

1098
01:42:48,240 --> 01:42:52,160
think you know nobody can mess with the Super Bowl and I just find that absurd because you

1099
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:56,640
look at what happened last night and you've seen that the referees made calls that should

1100
01:42:56,640 --> 01:43:01,320
have not been made it there calls that they overlooked that should have been made and

1101
01:43:01,320 --> 01:43:04,720
then you had this whole blackout which you know literally has everybody in the country

1102
01:43:04,720 --> 01:43:09,440
talking about the Super Bowl whether you want to or not and we did find that article we'll

1103
01:43:09,440 --> 01:43:15,660
put it back up on screen for TV viewers over at mfallwarsnews.com investigation finds suspected

1104
01:43:15,660 --> 01:43:23,120
fixing in 680 soccer matches and scanning over that while you were talking I noticed

1105
01:43:23,120 --> 01:43:27,080
that it's exactly what you wrote in your book how they're doing it because you've read the

1106
01:43:27,080 --> 01:43:28,080
FBI files.

1107
01:43:28,080 --> 01:43:32,800
Well exactly I mean I know that I know that games in the NFL have been fixed I know games

1108
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:36,760
in the NBA have been fixed in Major League Baseball and I know that they're still investigating

1109
01:43:36,760 --> 01:43:41,360
potential fixed games today the problem is you don't hear about it because they don't

1110
01:43:41,360 --> 01:43:44,120
want you to hear about it because they don't want you to think that something like this

1111
01:43:44,120 --> 01:43:48,120
could be corrupted because they want to distract you and they want to entertain you and they

1112
01:43:48,120 --> 01:43:51,560
don't want you to think about this sort of corruption within the game but it's true that

1113
01:43:51,560 --> 01:43:56,840
it has to be there I mean the NFL says we've never had a game fixed by anyone ever and

1114
01:43:56,840 --> 01:44:02,200
I've talked to numerous guys in sports books on both sides of the you know both sides of

1115
01:44:02,200 --> 01:44:05,600
the window guys who booked the bets guys who are making the bets and they'll say to a man

1116
01:44:05,600 --> 01:44:09,680
that that's absurd that of course games have been fixed but you can't prove these things

1117
01:44:09,680 --> 01:44:13,480
because you can't find the proof you can't find the evidence because there is no concrete

1118
01:44:13,480 --> 01:44:18,320
evidence of this sort of behavior so this is a big deal last night and you see that

1119
01:44:18,320 --> 01:44:22,080
game you know it's very likely that last night's game was manipulated to keep it interesting

1120
01:44:22,080 --> 01:44:26,680
to the very end to literally the last play of the game because it made CBS happy that

1121
01:44:26,680 --> 01:44:33,000
made the advertisers happy and it made the NFL happy go over the numbers on sports betting

1122
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:38,200
just in the United States well sports betting there's no been no good estimate because it's

1123
01:44:38,200 --> 01:44:42,840
all illegal I mean literally only perhaps as much as one percent of the amount of money

1124
01:44:42,840 --> 01:44:48,480
gambled on sporting events the United States has done legally in Las Vegas and Nevada otherwise

1125
01:44:48,480 --> 01:44:54,600
they estimate anywhere from 80 to 380 billion dollars is wagered illegally on this country

1126
01:44:54,600 --> 01:45:01,800
on sporting events each year which even if you take the low estimate the 80 billion dollars

1127
01:45:01,800 --> 01:45:06,040
it's nearly four times as much money as the NFL, NBA, Major League Baseball and the National

1128
01:45:06,040 --> 01:45:10,960
Hockey League combined.

1129
01:45:10,960 --> 01:45:17,560
It's amazing numbers we're talking about here did you see any signs overtly of manipulation

1130
01:45:17,560 --> 01:45:22,160
last night I mean I guess you're saying you did break down how they do that well the main

1131
01:45:22,160 --> 01:45:27,860
thing the legal way and it's the scary part is it is legal for like if the NFL wanted

1132
01:45:27,860 --> 01:45:31,360
to fix its own game if they wanted to fix the Super Bowl last night or manipulate it

1133
01:45:31,360 --> 01:45:35,640
they can do so legally because there's no law that prevents them from doing that and

1134
01:45:35,640 --> 01:45:38,880
the easiest way to do it would be through the referees now last night they had this

1135
01:45:38,880 --> 01:45:44,520
referee named Boger who was admittedly probably one of the middle ranked of their own officiating

1136
01:45:44,520 --> 01:45:49,240
crew and yet he wanted to officiate in the biggest game of the year which is not the

1137
01:45:49,240 --> 01:45:53,480
way the NFL is supposed to do it but a lot of people think because he was African American

1138
01:45:53,480 --> 01:45:57,720
that he got put on this main stage just because of that and now you have this guy on this

1139
01:45:57,720 --> 01:46:01,760
big stage and then you see clearly like especially late in the game calls that should have been

1140
01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:05,560
made penalties that should have been called on the Ravens that weren't called that weren't

1141
01:46:05,560 --> 01:46:10,200
assessed and you had guys like Phil Simms on CBS broadcast at first saying oh that was

1142
01:46:10,200 --> 01:46:15,120
a good no call and then as the game progressed he said well maybe they should have made that

1143
01:46:15,120 --> 01:46:18,360
call but I guess they're just letting them play out there well apparently if you have

1144
01:46:18,360 --> 01:46:22,920
a rule book in the NFL it doesn't always apply you can apply the rules when you want to and

1145
01:46:22,920 --> 01:46:28,760
obviously obviously he's been told to do this if it is fixed and so he's not going to get

1146
01:46:28,760 --> 01:46:35,520
in trouble and that's why you see these obvious calls that are meant to keep the game close

1147
01:46:35,520 --> 01:46:41,760
or longer exactly and that benefits everybody involved everybody is making more money because

1148
01:46:41,760 --> 01:46:45,880
of that because you know when's the last time we had a Super Bowl that wasn't really interesting

1149
01:46:45,880 --> 01:46:50,440
there was a blow-off it's been over a decade since that happened and I just don't I don't

1150
01:46:50,440 --> 01:46:55,320
believe in coincidence when billions of dollars are at stake and notice they say that this

1151
01:46:55,320 --> 01:47:00,300
was the highest rated and made the most money ever well and the scary part is I mean how

1152
01:47:00,300 --> 01:47:06,160
many people voted in the last presidential election like 126 million I think give or

1153
01:47:06,160 --> 01:47:11,400
take and that's probably pretty much the same amount of people in the United States who

1154
01:47:11,400 --> 01:47:16,720
watch a Super Bowl last night does that say something about our country and in not necessarily

1155
01:47:16,720 --> 01:47:20,880
the best of ways that we're more interested in a football game than perhaps who is in

1156
01:47:20,880 --> 01:47:24,480
control of our government

1157
01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:29,680
it is the modern bread and circus the opiate of the masses now what about the power outage

1158
01:47:29,680 --> 01:47:34,920
that's like the clue game or everybody's at the castle and the lights go off and somebody's

1159
01:47:34,920 --> 01:47:39,000
got a steak knife stuck in their chest and then the rest of the you know movie you're

1160
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:43,960
trying to find out who did it and then oh it's green energy we've got to get used to

1161
01:47:43,960 --> 01:47:50,280
the power going off I've seen them turn the power off for a few minutes to show that energy

1162
01:47:50,280 --> 01:47:56,060
is bad at soccer games in Europe and things I think it was staged I think they did this

1163
01:47:56,060 --> 01:48:03,060
on purpose to keep the game going to make everybody hyped them their awareness to have

1164
01:48:03,060 --> 01:48:08,600
something different go on what do you think I agree with you I don't think it was necessarily

1165
01:48:08,600 --> 01:48:13,880
legit but in fact that it was really truly just somebody screwed up somewhere I mean

1166
01:48:13,880 --> 01:48:17,480
I've heard real people say that the NFL did it on purpose like you say to make it more

1167
01:48:17,480 --> 01:48:22,000
interesting to get people talking about the game I've heard people say that city New Orleans

1168
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:27,600
did it basically as revenge against the NFL because of the bounty skate bounty gate scandal

1169
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:32,360
within the NFL that really punished the New Orleans Saints I've heard a lot of different

1170
01:48:32,360 --> 01:48:36,360
things and nobody it's amazing that nobody even from the city of New Orleans from the

1171
01:48:36,360 --> 01:48:41,640
power company there has said publicly what happened well you would think by now they

1172
01:48:41,640 --> 01:48:45,040
would have been pretty easy to figure it out because they got the lights back on within

1173
01:48:45,040 --> 01:48:50,340
30 minutes so it couldn't have been that big of a deal well here's the issue here's the

1174
01:48:50,340 --> 01:48:56,160
issue they turn the lights on all the time they know what they're doing and it just shows

1175
01:48:56,160 --> 01:49:00,700
the arrogance of the system that things like this happen but hey people don't just believe

1176
01:49:00,700 --> 01:49:05,700
now the official story they're told anymore that it was just a snafu that shows the power

1177
01:49:05,700 --> 01:49:10,600
structure is losing all its credibility where do you see this going for sports just bigger

1178
01:49:10,600 --> 01:49:14,680
and bigger and maybe you know the games get even more tight and it gets more obvious but

1179
01:49:14,680 --> 01:49:19,280
people don't care because the ticket says it's only entertainment well that's the main

1180
01:49:19,280 --> 01:49:23,560
thing it is only entertainment it is just show business but i think at a certain point

1181
01:49:23,560 --> 01:49:28,520
in time these things at least the united states has to reach a saturation level where it can't

1182
01:49:28,520 --> 01:49:33,280
get much bigger unless they put on more and more of a production where it becomes more

1183
01:49:33,280 --> 01:49:38,400
than sport which is fine where but where it becomes like you say show business where it's

1184
01:49:38,400 --> 01:49:42,080
not fine and where people start seeing through it i mean you know you only watch so much

1185
01:49:42,080 --> 01:49:46,800
reality tv before you realize well you know this isn't all real you know they're staging

1186
01:49:46,800 --> 01:49:50,360
some of this they're making these things occur because they have to keep the show interesting

1187
01:49:50,360 --> 01:49:54,560
well that's exactly what i think they do with sports that they stage certain things they

1188
01:49:54,560 --> 01:49:58,720
promote certain teams they promote certain players and make sure those teams and players

1189
01:49:58,720 --> 01:50:03,680
succeed because they think it makes it a better production it makes people well they're also

1190
01:50:03,680 --> 01:50:09,160
blurring the lines between reality and fiction where the zero dark 30 they have the white

1191
01:50:09,160 --> 01:50:13,880
house and the senate come out and say hardly any of this is accurate this is all wrong

1192
01:50:13,880 --> 01:50:19,240
but it's the original fake story the white house put out but then they put a disclaimer

1193
01:50:19,240 --> 01:50:24,160
oh this is inaccurate but people go and i've sat there in restaurants repeatedly because

1194
01:50:24,160 --> 01:50:27,760
i've gone to a restaurant twice right by a movie theater and i heard people talk about

1195
01:50:27,760 --> 01:50:33,520
oh it's a true story it's so incredible we just saw zero dark 30 and the thing is literally

1196
01:50:33,520 --> 01:50:37,920
a work of fiction yeah and that's why i think you know your sporting events are going the

1197

same way do one more segment with us i want to ask what else is on the radar screen and

1230
01:53:59,760 --> 01:54:12,160
you know i gotta be honest with you i only talked to chris kyle once for about 45 minutes

1231
01:54:12,160 --> 01:54:19,960
or so i guess i liked him i mean he came off like a real guy i guess he's from dallas like

1232
01:54:19,960 --> 01:54:29,120
i am or outside dallas like i am and i but i know jesse ventura never talks about wanting

1233
01:54:29,120 --> 01:54:33,440
troops to die and i've actually seen him tear up before all this happened talking and driving

1234
01:54:33,440 --> 01:54:37,400
in my car talking about troops being killed because he really loves the military all these

1235
01:54:37,400 --> 01:54:42,320
guys do did and that's ventura first said i think his gut was right he goes do you think

1236
01:54:42,320 --> 01:54:47,520
they had a double as a setup to set him up that's the first thing jesse ventura said

1237
01:54:47,520 --> 01:54:51,820
last year when i called him and he had to go into town to send an email to get on the

1238
01:54:51,820 --> 01:54:59,640
phone with me and he's like alex he had his wife there and he had it on speaker i guess

1239
01:54:59,640 --> 01:55:02,920
in a hotel room or whatever he's like alex ah you know you're joking this isn't real

1240
01:55:02,920 --> 01:55:09,360
lee come on and so i know ventura didn't do this and i just don't know what they did to

1241
01:55:09,360 --> 01:55:14,600
chris kyle but i think they killed him i mean just i was here reading this new article that

1242
01:55:14,600 --> 01:55:20,880
just went up at info wars.com just went up murdered navy seal was obama gun control foe

1243
01:55:20,880 --> 01:55:24,760
and i've actually seen this video this weekend where he was he was working and going to a

1244
01:55:24,760 --> 01:55:30,480
national campaign to get armed teachers and they just do not want somebody out there who's

1245
01:55:30,480 --> 01:55:34,840
got that type of credibility just like pat tillman was going to come home and bad mouth

1246
01:55:34,840 --> 01:55:40,360
the opium and stuff and they killed him murdered navy seal chris kyle gunned down at point

1247
01:55:40,360 --> 01:55:45,680
blank range in texas this past weekend was emerging as a prominent gun control critic

1248
01:55:45,680 --> 01:55:50,760
working to place armed guards in schools in the aftermath of the sandy hook massacre very

1249
01:55:50,760 --> 01:55:58,260
important article by paul watson and i it's not just that he's dead i mean i i i've said

1250
01:55:58,260 --> 01:56:01,760
bad things about him like you know he talks about lying in his book he talks about lying

1251
01:56:01,760 --> 01:56:07,880
for operations or whatever um it's not good to talk ill of the dead especially if you

1252
01:56:07,880 --> 01:56:14,840
don't know they were a bad person i just am just really really upset right now by the

1253
01:56:14,840 --> 01:56:19,760
way a lot of prominent pro-gun people are being killed and if this continues we know

1254
01:56:19,760 --> 01:56:25,040
there's a purge and atf is visiting gun owners that buy just one gun two guns buy ammo they're

1255
01:56:25,040 --> 01:56:29,680
harassing people uh homeland security says we're the new terrorist and man this is this

1256
01:56:29,680 --> 01:56:35,040
is bad this is bad they say returning vets are the number one enemy and obama's got an

1257
01:56:35,040 --> 01:56:38,880
nda we're going to come back the next hour go directly to brenda and others that are

1258
01:56:38,880 --> 01:56:44,600
holding the fix is in brown we got about three minutes how big is this soccer situation where

1259
01:56:44,600 --> 01:56:50,720
it's now coming out okay lance armstrong did dope okay yeah the soccer games are fixed

1260
01:56:50,720 --> 01:56:55,100
uh i mean this is this is a big deal if this ever starts coming out will it hurt things

1261
01:56:55,100 --> 01:56:58,600
or will it just be like going to disney world to watch a football game you know it's fake

1262
01:56:58,600 --> 01:57:04,440
but you know that uh sky mountain or whatever still is pretty fun i think you look at professional

1263
01:57:04,440 --> 01:57:08,280
wrestling and you can see that where people don't necessarily care that it's fake but

1264
01:57:08,280 --> 01:57:12,680
it's still a good entertainment it's still you know good show of physical prowess on

1265
01:57:12,680 --> 01:57:16,720
these people apart but you look at soccer like you say the thing that worries me the

1266
01:57:16,720 --> 01:57:20,800
thing that scares me it should scare a lot of sports fans in this country is if you can

1267
01:57:20,800 --> 01:57:24,360
look around the world and you can see as many games have been fixed apparently in soccer

1268
01:57:24,360 --> 01:57:29,200
there's i think 680 they mentioned that article alone and that's not covering everything that's

1269
01:57:29,200 --> 01:57:33,320
just one investigation i mean you look at tennis has been fixed you look at cricket

1270
01:57:33,320 --> 01:57:36,960
that's been fixed rugby games have been fixed but then you look here in the united states

1271
01:57:36,960 --> 01:57:41,160
and supposedly everything's fine you know nothing no football no baseball no basketball

1272
01:57:41,160 --> 01:57:45,880
no hockey well we're a free country i mean come on nothing the government private corporations

1273
01:57:45,880 --> 01:57:52,000
i mean jaeger hoover said the mafia was a conspiracy theory in 1952 well exactly and

1274
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:56,840
that's that's the part that should be frightening sports fans because you can't look at these

1275
01:57:56,840 --> 01:58:00,800
games and say they can't be fixed not when there's that much money being illegally gambled

1276
01:58:00,800 --> 01:58:05,400
out there that money has the power to corrupt because it's all going to organize crime they're

1277
01:58:05,400 --> 01:58:11,920
the ones who will run these illegal bookmakers and the power is crazy and zabigda brzezinski

1278
01:58:11,920 --> 01:58:16,360

on the air welcome brenda brenda actually brenda alex thanks uh you know i i stopped

1303
02:01:14,680 --> 02:01:20,400
watching uh grown adults watched their chase balls around on fields years ago when i became

1304
02:01:20,400 --> 02:01:26,600
much more of an infowars uh listener and fan and i thank you for that um uh but i did tune

1305
02:01:26,600 --> 02:01:35,240
in last night with my girlfriend who um knows that many of the things that uh info warriors

1306
02:01:35,240 --> 02:01:41,000
talk about are true but doesn't always want to deal with the uh thought process so i said

1307
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:46,160
hey look we gotta watch the halftime show i know it's gonna be schlocky but i really

1308
02:01:46,160 --> 02:01:51,580
want to see based off of last year's show how many overt illuminati signs there would

1309
02:01:51,580 --> 02:02:00,120
be and so it's going on you know as it progressed not many um light show pyramids and eyeballs

1310
02:02:00,120 --> 02:02:03,880
and stuff but then you see all these people in the crowd sticking their hands up there

1311
02:02:03,880 --> 02:02:10,640
the tallest people in the crowd i'm sure planted there and they're doing their pyramid you

1312
02:02:10,640 --> 02:02:16,920
know hand signs i said and i i told her about that ahead of time and uh she said no you're

1313
02:02:16,920 --> 02:02:21,000
just making you know it's funny you say that because again i dropped by a party for about

1314
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:26,240
an hour last night at a restaurant that shut down for the super bowl and so i went to a

1315
02:02:26,240 --> 02:02:30,360
crew party that i was invited to uh over at that restaurant nice restaurant the point

1316
02:02:30,360 --> 02:02:35,080
is putting a plug for steiner steakhouse and i'm over there with shane steiner and i'm

1317
02:02:35,080 --> 02:02:41,200
sitting there and one of the only times i was watching i looked up and i see the crowd

1318
02:02:41,200 --> 02:02:45,440
them showing people doing illuminati signs and my critics will now take that as a still

1319
02:02:45,440 --> 02:02:52,200
and say i'm doing that uh but sure enough you just called in about it and i'm so conditioned

1320
02:02:52,200 --> 02:02:57,440
i got in today and i'm not even telling my crew hey go get the halftime show show people

1321
02:02:57,440 --> 02:03:03,640
this that's how they get you it's like now it's an open secret they had weirdos standing

1322
02:03:03,640 --> 02:03:10,200
up everywhere and then beyonce show a document cam shot of this if you can she does the illuminati

1323
02:03:10,200 --> 02:03:15,160
symbol tell folks what you saw because i barely watched and caught some of that and i'm like

1324
02:03:15,160 --> 02:03:20,340
really did i just see that tell folks what you saw and i and i have more points on that

1325
02:03:20,340 --> 02:03:25,480
as well because you know tell me what you saw tell me what you saw i definitely i definitely

1326
02:03:25,480 --> 02:03:30,640
saw the tallest people in the crowd with gold you'll see this year the whole theme is gold

1327
02:03:30,640 --> 02:03:36,440
and black every award show everything going on in the gold bracelet doing clear pyramid

1328
02:03:36,440 --> 02:03:42,640
hand signs right in the camera shot the tallest people there are in those hands are the ones

1329
02:03:42,640 --> 02:03:47,480
that are lit up by the lights not only that i said she said well i want to see don't and

1330
02:03:47,480 --> 02:03:51,760
abby if the power's out and i said it doesn't matter turn back turn back to the super bowl

1331
02:03:51,760 --> 02:03:57,760
after 33 minutes oh my gosh it was a ritual they turned the light off and of course it

1332
02:03:57,760 --> 02:04:02,880
always has multiple uses just coming too fast now and then they're the thousand points of

1333
02:04:02,880 --> 02:04:07,920
light that's the highest illuminati type operation scallom bones george bush senior talks about

1334
02:04:07,920 --> 02:04:13,280
it and so they have a thousand people stand up and do the illuminati sign when the lights

1335
02:04:13,280 --> 02:04:20,320
off saying we're going to bring the light back yeah and the play-by-play guy at 27 minutes

1336
02:04:20,320 --> 02:04:25,320
if anyone who's t-bowed this i haven't gone back to it one of the guys says he trips himself

1337
02:04:25,320 --> 02:04:30,680
up and he says we're now in the 27th minute of power outage and blah blah and my girlfriend

1338
02:04:30,680 --> 02:04:35,000
said well can i flip it down to abby i said sure you know give five more minutes we got

1339
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:40,240
to go back to it that's when it'll be back on and she thinks that i'm full of baloney

1340
02:04:40,240 --> 02:04:46,040
and uh and sure enough that's what happened but at the 27th minute when i checked the

1341
02:04:46,040 --> 02:04:51,440
guy trips himself up and he starts to say we're now 27 minutes into it and then he starts

hogan have a group called the new world order after bush started talking about it bush senior

1434
02:14:08,440 --> 02:14:11,360
then people go oh you're talking about the new world order they've got to acclimate you

1435
02:14:11,360 --> 02:14:16,280
that it's non-threatening and a joke and then yahoo's like people claim there's something

1436
02:14:16,280 --> 02:14:21,360
called the illuminati it's a historical fact it's just one branch of illusiferian order

1437
02:14:21,360 --> 02:14:26,920
who publicly it's mainline history founded skull and bones the illuminati founded skull

1438
02:14:26,920 --> 02:14:34,040
and bones in 1832 it's chapter 322 which means the uncompleted because it's below the 33rd

1439
02:14:34,040 --> 02:14:41,920
32 degree you know that's masonic yes the general masons have not been satanic themselves

1440
02:14:41,920 --> 02:14:46,440
but an ancient construction guild with hidden knowledge but it predates judaism and christianity

1441
02:14:46,440 --> 02:14:52,600
so it is a cultic it was christianized you didn't just get into a university and learn

1442
02:14:52,600 --> 02:14:57,720
mathematics that was valuable so it got guarded by an intelligence agency you call it a secret

1443
02:14:57,720 --> 02:15:01,960
society because if you just indict masons you drive them away from the truth to being

1444
02:15:01,960 --> 02:15:07,320
honest about the fact that there's a war inside of the system with the illuminati trying to

1445
02:15:07,320 --> 02:15:17,520
take it over this is so disgusting see the most evil people know that really good truly

1446
02:15:17,520 --> 02:15:22,360
enlightened real illuminated people that just means awoken by god's light are going to

1447
02:15:22,360 --> 02:15:25,680
stand up for human liberty try to build it up so the evil comes in and says oh we're

1448
02:15:25,680 --> 02:15:31,680
good too we want to empower humanity join our order it's the real it's above the 33rd

1449
02:15:31,680 --> 02:15:41,000
degree you see and they're just doing giant rituals just

1450
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:48,360
like david ike said i mean they do these giant rituals they admit their rituals at the big

1451
02:15:48,360 --> 02:15:58,120
events out there like the olympics and now they have a 33 minute darkness with with weirdos

1452
02:15:58,120 --> 02:16:04,800
standing up in the crowd doing the hand sign magnifying with her up on the stage who did

1453
02:16:04,800 --> 02:16:11,920
the hand sign during the darkness during the 33 minutes i mean this was a stinking ritual

1454
02:16:11,920 --> 02:16:15,880
and the media is going to pick this up and call me crazy because they know they don't

1455
02:16:15,880 --> 02:16:20,800
want you to know they want to initiate your subconscious so you're in their cult but never

1456
02:16:20,800 --> 02:16:26,520
consciously new they don't want you to have free will they america is under a dark spell

1457
02:16:26,520 --> 02:16:32,520
we are under witchcraft folks this is real they've proven it it's scientific the ancients

1458
02:16:32,520 --> 02:16:42,360
just called it witchcraft we've been mesmerized hypnotized put into this and it's right there

1459
02:16:42,360 --> 02:16:48,640
they're all big on top big pyramids flashing illuminati signs with the lights going out

1460
02:16:48,640 --> 02:16:53,880
and i'm the conspiracy theorist there it is there it is what is this like five super bowls

1461
02:16:53,880 --> 02:16:58,480
in a row they've done this janet jackson's breast pops out oh she goes oops and there's

1462
02:16:58,480 --> 02:17:05,040
a sun sign and all the rest of this garbage they've got to do it they want your attention

1463
02:17:05,040 --> 02:17:09,040
they are doing rituals because they believe they're affecting you know whether you believe

1464
02:17:09,040 --> 02:17:13,480
in god or not believe in the spiritual world they teach you it's smart to not believe in

1465
02:17:13,480 --> 02:17:18,340
the spiritual world because you can't see it well this this this domain this five senses

1466
02:17:18,340 --> 02:17:23,600
third dimension is is only one it's been proven mathematically what all the ancients said

1467
02:17:23,600 --> 02:17:29,400
there are all these other layers above us all this full spectrum it's there and whether

1468
02:17:29,400 --> 02:17:36,600
it's real or not whether there's things inhabiting that or not intelligences the elites believe

1469
02:17:36,600 --> 02:17:41,680
it's giving them power they believe they are in contact with entities across the void they

1470
02:17:41,680 --> 02:17:46,860
believe they've got power from it so they are in power whether they believe they got

1471
02:17:46,860 --> 02:17:50,860
the power from it and just had confidence from it or whether they really are getting

1472
02:17:50,860 --> 02:17:57,320
the power from it you cannot debate the fact they are worshipping devilish entities and

1473
02:17:57,320 --> 02:18:00,860
look at what the elite does look at how they're trying to wreck the family how they're trying

1474
02:18:00,860 --> 02:18:04,660
to wreck liberty how they're trying to bring in tyranny how they're doing all of this they're

1475
02:18:04,660 --> 02:18:09,000
doing all of this in your face and see i'm so sick of it and i was watching this when

1476
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:13,680
i was calm last night i was put under a little bit of a trance i wasn't even going to come

1477
02:18:13,680 --> 02:18:20,120
in and cover it until the caller called in and shifted me back into being aware you see

1478
02:18:20,120 --> 02:18:27,900
how dangerous it is to watch stuff like that wow what an epiphany i just had brendan in

1479
02:18:27,900 --> 02:18:31,240
wisconsin you only got about a minute and a half recap your points and then finish the

1480
02:18:31,240 --> 02:18:37,800
other ones okay i'm i'm gonna recap that yeah you see the illuminati hand signs but the

1481
02:18:37,800 --> 02:18:42,720
triangles from the crowd it's of the people right and the and the and the spotlights are

1482
02:18:42,720 --> 02:18:47,840
only hitting those really tall hands right in the front that's one point 33 minutes the

1483
02:18:47,840 --> 02:18:53,520
nfl or cbs was saying 34 minutes no no i looked it up this morning it was 33 minutes usa today

1484
02:18:53,520 --> 02:18:58,920
i'll be 33.55 now we timed it now specifically because we're gonna go pull it up i saw it

1485
02:18:58,920 --> 02:19:04,600
when were they holding the hands up in the illuminati ritual not not her when when were

1486
02:19:04,600 --> 02:19:11,760
the plants doing it what time was that uh that was that was right during the halftime

1487
02:19:11,760 --> 02:19:17,620
show which i really can't stand to watch nor could i last year but you have awakened me

1488
02:19:17,620 --> 02:19:22,640
and other people have awakened me so now i force myself to watch that garbage um there

1489
02:19:22,640 --> 02:19:29,840
are a few other key points that the the power went out with 13 22 3 2 2 13 22 on the clock

1490
02:19:29,840 --> 02:19:35,120
i don't know if that's significant 3 2 2 now it's all significant it's all staged and i

1491
02:19:35,120 --> 02:19:40,520
have a couple more points if you have time go start making them okay and also psyops

1492
02:19:40,520 --> 02:19:47,160
always occur every time there's focused attention around the world and i talked to uh professor

1540
02:24:51,760 --> 02:24:59,520
uh let's talk to derek in texas derek you're on the air welcome alex thank you it's an

1541
02:24:59,520 --> 02:25:05,280
honor to speak to you 13 year listener first time caller god bless i'll call it i'm calling

1542
02:25:05,280 --> 02:25:09,320
this find out your opinion about piers morgan coming here to tactical firearms in katie

1543
02:25:09,320 --> 02:25:16,080
texas he's coming here to report tonight apparently about uh he's gonna be shooting a gun there

1544
02:25:16,080 --> 02:25:23,480
and i heard that the owner of the tactical firearms was once deported an ammunition van

1545
02:25:23,480 --> 02:25:29,640
say that again the owner of tactical fire no start over at the beginning usually they're

1546
02:25:29,640 --> 02:25:32,840
not telling me stuff and it's not their fault they're supposed to talk to me they're telling

1547
02:25:32,840 --> 02:25:37,640
me lord monkton was there and i missed the first part of what she said start over i'm

1548
02:25:37,640 --> 02:25:43,400
sorry piers morgan is supposed to be reporting at tactical firearms in katie texas tonight

1549
02:25:43,400 --> 02:25:48,600
he's supposed he's supposed to be shooting a gun talking about um background checks mental

1550
02:25:48,600 --> 02:25:54,760
health and uh i think it's interesting because the owner of tactical firearms has once been

1551
02:25:54,760 --> 02:26:01,160
on the radio supporting an ammunition ban i didn't know that slime morgan was going

1552
02:26:01,160 --> 02:26:06,280
to be here because again he doesn't have a big audience sometimes the stuff on his show

1553
02:26:06,280 --> 02:26:11,840
gets played on other shows so it only has a big audience when what he does is a derivative

1554
02:26:11,840 --> 02:26:18,200
and then he gets a tiny amount of actual viewers to his show from that he has biggest shows

1555
02:26:18,200 --> 02:26:22,200
like half a million when i was on like a million and 800,000 the next day and then it went

1556
02:26:22,200 --> 02:26:29,920
down from there uh but katie texas uh he's gonna be uh he's gonna be there himself shooting

1557
02:26:29,920 --> 02:26:36,280
so that's that's the room the rumor had it that he was coming to a gun gun shop in texas

1558
02:26:36,280 --> 02:26:42,680
and then uh he proved it on his twitter account two days ago he is coming to tactical firearms

1559
02:26:42,680 --> 02:26:46,320
and uh it's happening right down the street from me i was just curious if anybody from

1560
02:26:46,320 --> 02:26:50,080
your crew is going to be there reporting or if i should go try to get some photos or what

1561
02:26:50,080 --> 02:26:55,000
i haven't gotten any response from tactical firearms themselves i don't really know uh

1562
02:26:55,000 --> 02:27:01,240
the full details but um i was shocked to hear it and uh i just i just hope someone in your

1563
02:27:01,240 --> 02:27:07,400
crew is covering it well katie's katie's pretty close to texas no no he's saying the guy put

1564
02:27:07,400 --> 02:27:13,080
a twitter out he's saying go to piers morgan's twitter guys that's how you confirm it um

1565
02:27:13,080 --> 02:27:19,560
so piers morgan you're saying put it out on twitter yes piers piers morgan is coming to

1566
02:27:19,560 --> 02:27:27,200
houston let's put that back up on screen for viewers tactical firearms is very very proud

1567
02:27:27,200 --> 02:27:35,200
of that and he's going to a facility where they support restricting our second amendment

1568
02:27:35,200 --> 02:27:42,000
isn't that just classic yeah are you have you been aware of the of that owner um you

1569
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:47,200
know uh being supportive of all this gun control legislation and whatnot and then no i wasn't

1570
02:27:47,200 --> 02:27:50,160
aware of that but you know what they're gonna do they're gonna come down here and go i'm

1571
02:27:50,160 --> 02:27:54,180
here in the heart of the crazy texans but even these texans want to turn their guns

1572
02:27:54,180 --> 02:28:00,520
in i don't dislike texans sure i'm a red coat while your ancestors trounced the filthy king

1573
02:28:00,520 --> 02:28:06,960
i worship i mean just unbelievable i felt exactly the same way when i woke up i was

1574
02:28:06,960 --> 02:28:12,800
furious i couldn't believe that well listen everybody should go you know it's a private

1575
02:28:12,800 --> 02:28:17,960
facility so it's private property but everybody should go and be part of it and try to be

1576
02:28:17,960 --> 02:28:23,000
interviewed by cnn and i think people ought to be across the street from it it's a free

1577
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:28,640
country bullhorning piers morgan and protesting his butt i don't know if i've got time to

1578
02:28:28,640 --> 02:28:34,200
get in the car and get down there i mean how far away is katie from austin it's only about

1579
02:28:34,200 --> 02:28:39,920
an hour and 45 minutes on a good drive from you um i was just shocked yeah why are they

1580
02:28:39,920 --> 02:28:44,520
saying houston cnn doesn't even know when i heard katie and then the news said houston

1581
02:28:44,520 --> 02:28:50,240
i'm like katie's not houston well exactly i actually live right in right where he where

1582
02:28:50,240 --> 02:28:56,040

1656
02:36:17,620 --> 02:36:21,780
you for coming on with us alex it's a real pleasure to be with you and congratulations

1657
02:36:21,780 --> 02:36:26,460
on your wonderful interview with piers morgan on gun control i wonder how many tens of millions

1658
02:36:26,460 --> 02:36:31,380
have seen it now uh it is tens of millions airing on every tv station out there and also

1659
02:36:31,380 --> 02:36:34,940
tens of millions online but but you know i actually was under the weather that day and

1660
02:36:34,940 --> 02:36:40,300
blew up at him but i'm glad i did because it got people out of their coma we need to

1661
02:36:40,300 --> 02:36:45,360
get aggressive with these people and he tried to spin it that i'm being anti-uk i'm actually

1662
02:36:45,360 --> 02:36:51,420
pro-uk in england i want you to be a sovereign country not under eu domination my ancestors

1663
02:36:51,420 --> 02:36:56,860
uh... come from uh... wales in england and scotland ireland piers morgan's tried to

1664
02:36:56,860 --> 02:37:03,140
spin it though and so so is the british press that i'm i'm being anti anti-british i'm anti

1665
02:37:03,140 --> 02:37:07,980
being disarmed it's not british to have your weapons taken in fact you guys always had

1666
02:37:07,980 --> 02:37:12,260
the right to keep mere arms until it was taken by the collectivist you want to briefly speak

1667
02:37:12,260 --> 02:37:17,860
to that well certainly i mean we we had a shooting incident like the one that has provoked

1668
02:37:17,860 --> 02:37:23,460
the latest round of demands for gun control in the u s this was a done blaine in scotland

1669
02:37:23,460 --> 02:37:28,020
and unfortunately it happened during a socialist government and of course whenever the socialists

1670
02:37:28,020 --> 02:37:33,900
get the chance to tighten up on legislation they will and so there was a knee-jerk reaction

1671
02:37:33,900 --> 02:37:40,820
in parliament and a law was passed to take away our hand guns which were almost entirely

1672
02:37:40,820 --> 02:37:46,220
held in private collections and were shot privately on ranges under supervision it was

1673
02:37:46,220 --> 02:37:51,260
all very well control as you can imagine in the uk and anyway all of that was swept away

1674
02:37:51,260 --> 02:37:58,740
but the result was the interesting thing crime involving hand guns went up by forty percent

1675
02:37:58,740 --> 02:38:05,440
the moment they took our hand guns away because once you drive the ownership of guns underground

1676
02:38:05,440 --> 02:38:10,380
then all you do is you criminalize it and that increases the use of guns in crime it

1677
02:38:10,380 --> 02:38:18,180
does not reduce it it certainly does now you talk about that the the the new face of fascism

1678
02:38:18,180 --> 02:38:22,220
agenda 21 people are starting to wake up to it but you've traveled australia that's been

1679
02:38:22,220 --> 02:38:26,320
captured uh by this even though the people are awake and don't like it in polls i've

1680
02:38:26,320 --> 02:38:31,540
seen it doesn't matter what government they put in it just continues break down how draconian

1681
02:38:31,540 --> 02:38:38,620
it is in a country what four five years ahead of uh other nations well that's right see

1682
02:38:38,620 --> 02:38:45,540
the european dictatorship and the dictatorship of julia gillard the communist from wales

1683
02:38:45,540 --> 02:38:52,140
who runs australia at the moment and is at the moment herself facing an extremely serious

1684
02:38:52,140 --> 02:38:57,060
criminal investigation which is getting very very close to her and that's one of the reasons

1685
02:38:57,060 --> 02:39:02,220
why she's announced the um election uh that they're about to have and she's announced

1686
02:39:02,220 --> 02:39:07,380
it seven months before is going to be held the other reason why she's announced an earlier

1687
02:39:07,380 --> 02:39:13,300
question incidentally is that kevin rudd the man whom she displaced with an internal coup

1688
02:39:13,300 --> 02:39:17,540
in the labor party is the kind of thing that communists do to each other all the time uh

1689
02:39:17,540 --> 02:39:22,380
she had heard that next month he was going to mount a leadership challenge to get back

1690
02:39:22,380 --> 02:39:28,520
the premiership from her and that he had the numbers to do it she's become very unpopular

1691
02:39:28,520 --> 02:39:33,500
even within her own party and of course she's uh even more unpopular i think than obama

1692
02:39:33,500 --> 02:39:39,720
uh with her opponents here and so she heard he was mounting this challenge and that he'd

1693
02:39:39,720 --> 02:39:44,940
got the numbers in the parliamentary labor party to to to win and so what she did was

1694
02:39:44,940 --> 02:39:49,780
to announce the date of the election very hastily because then if he were to announce

1695
02:39:49,780 --> 02:39:54,820
a leadership challenge it would seem to the party like downright disloyalty not just to

1696
02:39:54,820 --> 02:39:59,780
her but to the party as a whole and then he wouldn't have the numbers so it was a master

1697
02:39:59,780 --> 02:40:05,180
stroke on her part and of course she can also take advantage of the fact that during the

1698
02:40:05,180 --> 02:40:10,020
campaigning which has effectively already begun she can do all of her campaigning on

1699
02:40:10,020 --> 02:40:14,820
the government's dime while the opposition can't so she's hoping to gain advantage from

1700
02:40:14,820 --> 02:40:20,540
it but she is getting very close to having her collar felt in a criminal investigation

1701
02:40:20,540 --> 02:40:26,300
i can't give more details over the air but it's certainly something which i'm not sure

1702
02:40:26,300 --> 02:40:31,960
she'll even last out until september because they are getting that close to her now but

1703
02:40:31,960 --> 02:40:36,740
in the meantime she and her government introduced what is called a carbon tax they were originally

1704
02:40:36,740 --> 02:40:41,660
going to charge larger companies and fossil fuel companies and big manufacturers and farmers

1705
02:40:41,660 --> 02:40:49,220
and miners and fishermen they were going to charge them 23 dollars for every ton of carbon

1706
02:40:49,220 --> 02:40:55,420
dioxide they emitted as part of the their electricity use it was going to be enormously

1707
02:40:55,420 --> 02:41:01,980
cripplingly expensive it was going to shut down the economy of australia unfortunately

1708
02:41:01,980 --> 02:41:07,940
uh the opposition here led by tony abbott who is a very thoughtful quiet and extremely

1709
02:41:07,940 --> 02:41:14,260
determined man managed to divert her away from doing that and in the end she cut and

1710
02:41:14,260 --> 02:41:20,420
ran and said no we can't charge 23 dollars a ton when the rest of the world is only paying

1711
02:41:20,420 --> 02:41:24,140
or at least the eu which is the only other place that's really got a carbon tax is only

1712
02:41:24,140 --> 02:41:30,020
paying at the moment kind of two or three dollars a ton and so she decided to link the

1713
02:41:30,020 --> 02:41:36,700
carbon tax here with the european trading scheme so that the same price is charged for

1714
02:41:36,700 --> 02:41:41,720
carbon dioxide here as in europe and of course she will go on the television and say that

1715
02:41:41,720 --> 02:41:47,200
what she's demonstrating is leadership in doing this but the rest of the world is conspicuously

1716
02:41:47,200 --> 02:41:53,300
not following even of course obama's united states is not going to have the cab and text

1717
02:41:53,300 --> 02:41:58,380
and of course if you go further north to canada where stephen harper now has as a conservative

1718
02:41:58,380 --> 02:42:02,900
an overall majority as prime minister a rare thing in their electoral system he is shutting

1719
02:42:02,900 --> 02:42:09,100
down all this environmental nonsense all these creepy agencies that are going around trying

1720
02:42:09,100 --> 02:42:14,740
to close down the the economies of the west while here in australia of course these agencies

1721
02:42:14,740 --> 02:42:20,740
are rampant i'm speaking to you at the moment from the summit of mount lofty in australia

1722
02:42:20,740 --> 02:42:25,340
just in south australia around the back of adelaide it's the most beautiful country

1723
02:42:25,340 --> 02:42:30,180
around here but of course this is the middle of their summer so it's fairly dry and they

1724
02:42:30,180 --> 02:42:35,860
all have all the farmers up here i'm staying with one of them they all keep small dams

1725
02:42:35,860 --> 02:42:40,020
that they've built to retain a bit of water to make sure that their stock and their crops

1726
02:42:40,020 --> 02:42:44,220
can be watered when the rains don't come which they don't come for six months of the year

1727
02:42:44,220 --> 02:42:50,740
and sometimes for seven years at a time and what is happening is that in has come the

1728
02:42:50,740 --> 02:42:55,260
natural resources management board of south australia one of the most hated bureaucracies

1729
02:42:55,260 --> 02:43:00,500
on earth and it's going around interfering with people's right to take water from the

1730
02:43:00,500 --> 02:43:06,140
dams that they and their ancestors have built as a result farms are closing at so large

1731
02:43:06,140 --> 02:43:11,540
a rate but since the 1970s something like a hundred thousand farmers in australia have

1732
02:43:11,540 --> 02:43:16,340
already gone out of business not because they can't make money in farming because they're

1733
02:43:16,340 --> 02:43:21,660
pretty good at it out here it's it's the biggest industry in australia no it's because they're

1734
02:43:21,660 --> 02:43:27,540
being pestered by so many bureaucrats just down the road from where i'm speaking a few

1735
02:43:27,540 --> 02:43:33,700
years ago there was a guy extracting the water from his his dam or in fact it was from a

1736
02:43:33,700 --> 02:43:39,060
neighbor's dam but he had permission to do it so that he could water his stock and there

1737
02:43:39,060 --> 02:43:43,980
were snoopers this is how they do it snoopers have been hiding for weeks behind a hedge

1738
02:43:43,980 --> 02:43:50,140
on a hill nearby watching him through binoculars they didn't realize that he was supplying

1739
02:43:50,140 --> 02:43:57,340
this water to his stock and they eventually did a raid at 11 o'clock at night while he

1740
02:43:57,340 --> 02:44:02,780
was working on one of the pumps that wasn't functioning they punched on him they drove

1741
02:44:02,780 --> 02:44:08,700
their utility vehicle at him which had a rhubarb on the front they hit him with that and he

1742
02:44:08,700 --> 02:44:15,540
still has pain from that to this day six years later and then they left him for dead and

1743
02:44:15,540 --> 02:44:20,780
the next thing they did realizing they'd done wrong was to go and report that he had done

1744
02:44:20,780 --> 02:44:26,620
to them what they had done to him so when he went a week later to the two weeks later

1745
02:44:26,620 --> 02:44:30,700
to the police station after he got out of hospital to say that he'd been attacked in

1746
02:44:30,700 --> 02:44:35,500
this way he was immediately arrested on the ground quite specious that he had attacked

1747
02:44:35,500 --> 02:44:40,940
them that's what's going on here i am now investigating this case and i'm about to do

1748
02:44:40,940 --> 02:44:46,100
an amicus curiae brief to the court that eventually convicted him of illegally taking water from

1749
02:44:46,100 --> 02:44:51,160
that creek because the conviction was wrong i've already established that he had taken

1750
02:44:51,160 --> 02:44:55,780
none of the water they said he'd taken for any purpose other than supplying his stock

1751
02:44:55,780 --> 02:45:00,460
which he had written permission from the government to do well what's incredible is they're harassing

1752
02:45:00,460 --> 02:45:05,580
everybody i mean i see the australian it's alex because uh... what we're going to do

1753
02:45:05,580 --> 02:45:09,100
is it looks to me at the moment and i've got to do a little bit of further investigation

1754
02:45:09,100 --> 02:45:14,060
it looks to me at the at the moment as though these three agents of the natural resources

1755
02:45:14,060 --> 02:45:19,100
management board committed attempted murder because that's what it is if you drive your

1756
02:45:19,100 --> 02:45:25,300
vehicle at somebody you knock them down and you leave them for dead that's attempted murder

1757
02:45:25,300 --> 02:45:29,800
so we're not going to be patsies out here anymore i've been talking to farmers all over

1758
02:45:29,800 --> 02:45:34,340
the state they're absolutely boiling furious at what's being done and if you notice now

1759
02:45:34,340 --> 02:45:39,340
the government that took the the semi-auto rifles now they want the bolt action in single

1760
02:45:39,340 --> 02:45:44,220
shot this is an authoritarian takeover they're handing the entire continent over to the communist

1761
02:45:44,220 --> 02:45:49,220
chinese uh... that's on record ninety nine percent of their rare earth minerals of australia

1762
02:45:49,220 --> 02:45:56,700
now run by state-run chinese communist operations but i see the newscast mainline tv out of

1763
02:45:56,700 --> 02:46:01,700
australia you've been there many times i've never been there where they show sheep farmers

1764
02:46:01,700 --> 02:46:07,080
who own the land and they say sorry you can't graze anymore uh... this has to be off use

1765
02:46:07,080 --> 02:46:12,940
for the earth your sheep's flatulence is bad for the atmosphere i mean this is a real hard

1766
02:46:12,940 --> 02:46:14,020
core tyranny

1767
02:46:14,020 --> 02:46:16,400
uh... if you want to know what it takes

1768
02:46:16,400 --> 02:46:20,260
there is a notorious case here that of peter spencer who actually went on hunger strike

1769
02:46:20,260 --> 02:46:24,840
to draw attention that's right that tied himself to a tower has been farming the land for three

1770
02:46:24,840 --> 02:46:31,700
generations and then in order to comply with some useless uh... obligation under the now

1771
02:46:31,700 --> 02:46:38,340
expired kyoto protocol the australian government arbitrarily said right we're taking away your

1772
02:46:38,340 --> 02:46:43,700
right to farm your land because it's been designated as a carbon sink and of course

1773
02:46:43,700 --> 02:46:48,020
they're doing this all over australia they're driving farmers off their own land and of

1774
02:46:48,020 --> 02:46:53,740
course the uh... property right in australia is protected by the constitution so what they're

1775
02:46:53,740 --> 02:46:57,860
craftily doing is they're just saying we're not taking away your land we're just telling

1776
02:46:57,860 --> 02:47:02,460
you can't actually farm it that of course renders the land worthless and therefore in

1777
02:47:02,460 --> 02:47:06,900
effect they have taken away your property right but they've managed to dodge and duck

1778
02:47:06,900 --> 02:47:11,860
and dive and unfortunately the courts here rather like in the united states are poodles

1779
02:47:11,860 --> 02:47:16,860
of the government that pays their lavish salaries and pensions and they will just not find against

1780
02:47:16,860 --> 02:47:20,620
the government when the government behaves in this way all right lord logton let me stop

1781
02:47:20,620 --> 02:47:26,500
you for the mineral class the three big industries are far mining and fishing all three of these

1782
02:47:26,500 --> 02:47:32,140
are now up in arms because the australian government and its various sinister agencies

1783
02:47:32,140 --> 02:47:37,140
is attacking and attacking and attacking they're trying to close australia down in the background

1784
02:47:37,140 --> 02:47:43,060
to this alex is agenda twenty one this u n program all forty chapters of it which was

1785
02:47:43,060 --> 02:47:48,380
first produced in nineteen ninety two but that ridiculous rio earth summit and the idea

1786
02:47:48,380 --> 02:47:54,620
of agenda twenty one is to close down the economies of the west by saying that in the

1787
02:47:54,620 --> 02:47:59,980
name of the environment we must reduce the population of the earth by nine tenths and

1788
02:47:59,980 --> 02:48:05,500
we must do that according to bill gates by vaccination he actually said it in a lecture

1789
02:48:05,500 --> 02:48:11,060
i've seen on the internet i i couldn't believe it until i watched it these people are completely

02:55:24,280 --> 02:55:29,800
and invite him hey if this was so discrediting my interview with you why would you have me

1869
02:55:29,800 --> 02:55:35,440
back on lord monkton what do you think i should say to piers morgan if i see him again i mean

1870
02:55:35,440 --> 02:55:40,020
didn't he get run out of your country well i think what you should say to him is that

1871
02:55:40,020 --> 02:55:45,640
he should go back where he came from and not try to interfere in the internal affairs of

1872
02:55:45,640 --> 02:55:51,120
the united states i mean yes you know all these lefties are the same in the media they

1873
02:55:51,120 --> 02:55:55,920
all think that nobody should be allowed guns that the the police state should be allowed

1874
02:55:55,920 --> 02:56:01,080
to push everybody around and well you and i rather disagree with that alex and you know

1875
02:56:01,080 --> 02:56:08,120
it has been said by some that you are right on the extreme fringe well hey somebody occasionally

1876
02:56:08,120 --> 02:56:12,800
has to stand out a little bit from the crowd to try and warn the crowd of what's about

1877
02:56:12,800 --> 02:56:19,000
to hit them and there is no doubt now that the governing class worldwide is increasingly

1878
02:56:19,000 --> 02:56:26,700
tying itself together using the excuses such as climate change agenda went 21 environment

1879
02:56:26,700 --> 02:56:30,880
using gun control is something we can all unite behind this is the kind of slogan you

1880
02:56:30,880 --> 02:56:38,200
hear and so piers morgan is just part if you like of the establishment or the governing

1881
02:56:38,200 --> 02:56:45,520
class or what the french call the class politique who are increasingly remote and cut off from

1882
02:56:45,520 --> 02:56:50,400
ordinary people like z and me who are simply trying to get on and do a job of work and

1883
02:56:50,400 --> 02:56:56,000
not be interfered with by our rulers and of course the whole idea of the united states

1884
02:56:56,000 --> 02:57:02,120
was not to be interfered with by your rulers and unfortunately now even in the united states

1885
02:57:02,120 --> 02:57:07,640
your government is trying to turn itself into a tyranny the environmental protection agency

1886
02:57:07,640 --> 02:57:15,240
just like the south australia bureau of natural resources management is trying to take over

1887
02:57:15,240 --> 02:57:20,980
and interfere and effectively to legislate by the back door and to push people around

1888
02:57:20,980 --> 02:57:26,200
and you have these little tin pot officials in their shiny shoes and their polished suits

1889
02:57:26,200 --> 02:57:32,040
rushing around in government cars you know pestering farmers all over the place and the

1890
02:57:32,040 --> 02:57:37,280
lord monkton foundation which has been established here in australia is going as its first battle

1891
02:57:37,280 --> 02:57:43,440
to take these people on and say if you go around bullying farmers for instance and threatening

1892
02:57:43,440 --> 02:57:49,320
them that you will drive them off their land and that's one farmer i've talked already

1893
02:57:49,320 --> 02:57:55,560
has been threatened with that if you go around and treat them by saying that their reservoirs

1894
02:57:55,560 --> 02:58:00,920
are 10 million liters when they're only five million liters because if they're over 10

1895
02:58:00,920 --> 02:58:06,400
million you're allowed to regulate and interfere if you go around cheating like that in future

1896
02:58:06,400 --> 02:58:11,360
we will have you for it you will be up in either the civil or more probably the criminal

1897
02:58:11,360 --> 02:58:15,960
court all right let me stop you lord mountain put him put him on hold real quick now mike

1898
02:58:15,960 --> 02:58:19,920
adams who i really trust says he knows tactical firearms and they're great guys so this is

1899
02:58:19,920 --> 02:58:25,360
all moving quick and that they don't support bullet bands so maybe that's not true and

1900
02:58:25,360 --> 02:58:29,180
if that's the case i apologize that's not right this is all moving quick i know piers

1901
02:58:29,180 --> 02:58:33,880
morgan has been bragging he's going to go to a place that's pro gun control uh so again

1902
02:58:33,880 --> 02:58:37,800
tactical firearms may be great guys in fact i was looking at photos of them with guns

1919
03:00:27,240 --> 03:00:32,160
things move quick and i was told and i had to print out some of the news reports that

1920
03:00:32,160 --> 03:00:37,400
were misconstrued that the tactical firearms was having piers morgan down because they

1921
03:00:37,400 --> 03:00:42,240
agreed with restricting bullets when you buy a bunch getting a background check and that

1922
03:00:42,240 --> 03:00:47,200
is not what they believe mike adams says he knows the owner for five years and that those

1923
03:00:47,200 --> 03:00:52,280
news reports are incorrect so i apologize the tactical firearms tactical firearms dot

1924
03:00:52,280 --> 03:00:57,440
us so that was uh incorrect the point is we know piers morgan uh is anti-gun there are

1925
03:00:57,440 --> 03:01:01,640
some gun shops and gun people that are so scared of the atf they are rolling over and

1926
03:01:01,640 --> 03:01:06,440
that's who i was talking about there but mike adams is 100 second amendment says they're

1927
03:01:06,440 --> 03:01:09,600
great then i'm sure they're great so people should definitely support them in the houston

1928
03:01:09,600 --> 03:01:16,220
area uh and i've also confirmed piers morgan piers morgan is like taping between about

1929
03:01:16,220 --> 03:01:24,840
three and six so i'm on my way piers soon as the show ends i'm coming i am coming to

1930
03:01:24,840 --> 03:01:29,120
to protest you coming here telling me i should give my guns up now if you were coming here

1931
03:01:29,120 --> 03:01:33,520
saying you wanted to help me have my freedom i'd say well you know join the club uh but

1932
03:01:33,520 --> 03:01:36,840
truly disgusting uh finishing up with lord montan sorry to cut you off there at the end

1933
03:01:36,840 --> 03:01:40,960
of the hour but i want to see everybody down there at tactical firearms tonight folks start

1934
03:01:40,960 --> 03:01:44,340
getting over there right now the next few hours other points you'd like to make lord

1935
03:01:44,340 --> 03:01:49,480
montan about where this attack uh worldwide is going people are starting to wake up to

1936
03:01:49,480 --> 03:01:55,320
agenda 21 but is it enough what do we do well i think the first thing is keep a very close

1937
03:01:55,320 --> 03:02:03,040
eye on every environmental law that gets passed because you'll find that what agenda 21 does

1938
03:02:03,040 --> 03:02:09,040
is that it works chiefly at local level what these agents of the un have done is they've

1939
03:02:09,040 --> 03:02:15,360
gone round to local authorities and convinced them one by one that they should implement

1940
03:02:15,360 --> 03:02:21,120
agenda 21 because no national government would go as far as that and there's an outfit called

1941
03:02:21,120 --> 03:02:28,200
ichli i c l e i and if your local authority belongs to that organization then boy are

1942
03:02:28,200 --> 03:02:37,280
you in trouble these are the new dictators they operate by stealth and their vice-chair

1943
03:02:37,280 --> 03:02:44,000
and recently said that in future the individual must subject himself to the collective and

1944
03:02:44,000 --> 03:02:49,800
so this is straightforward outright in your face communism dressed up as though it were

1945
03:02:49,800 --> 03:02:54,820
to do with the environment i call them the traffic light tendency the greens too yellow

1946
03:02:54,820 --> 03:03:00,600
to admit they're really reds but they're operating bureaucratically through your local authority

1947
03:03:00,600 --> 03:03:04,720
and you need to find out and you need to get onto your local authority representatives

1948
03:03:04,720 --> 03:03:10,800
your local councillors etcetera and you need to say to them but if they belong to ichli

1949
03:03:10,800 --> 03:03:16,000
you will vote for whichever party says that it will leave that organization and have nothing

1950
03:03:16,000 --> 03:03:24,080
to do with agenda 21 you have to get agenda 21 onto the agenda of local elections and

1951
03:03:24,080 --> 03:03:30,560
make it clear that any candidate who supported agenda 21 will not get elected by you and

1952
03:03:30,560 --> 03:03:37,160
once they all begin to realize that agenda 21 is hated and feared by the people as it

1953
03:03:37,160 --> 03:03:42,840
should be then they will uh break free and just to let you know uh one piece of rather

1954
03:03:42,840 --> 03:03:49,480
interesting news a map was produced by ichli of the united states which showed the places

1955
03:03:49,480 --> 03:03:55,080
where humans could and could not go more than half the map was covered in red where humans

1956
03:03:55,080 --> 03:03:59,840
were allowed to go under no circumstances at all nearly all the remainder was colored

1957
03:03:59,840 --> 03:04:04,700
in yellow where you could go with a permit from the socialist state if you were very

1958
03:04:04,700 --> 03:04:11,200
lucky and if they agreed to give you one but there were a few tiny areas most of the military

1959
03:04:11,200 --> 03:04:17,400
installations to keep the people in line and only a few effectively concentration camps

1960
03:04:17,400 --> 03:04:22,800
where all the population of america would in future have to reside and opponents of

1961
03:04:22,800 --> 03:04:27,360
agenda 21 took that map they got hold of it at the last minute they took that map to the

1962
03:04:27,360 --> 03:04:33,680
u.s senate and they showed it to senators and their staff hours before the senate was

1963
03:04:33,680 --> 03:04:38,080
and it shot it down we're out of time lord monses we're out of time i don't think you
