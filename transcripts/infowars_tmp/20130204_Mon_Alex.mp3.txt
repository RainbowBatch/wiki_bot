Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
Here we are, Monday, already the fourth day of February, 2013. I am your host, Alex Jones.
All right, here's what's going to happen. We've got Lord Monckton, who is over in Australia,
popping in for 30 minutes at the tail end of the broadcast today. He's going to be joining
us to talk about agenda 21, four or five years ahead of us, because Australia, more than
any other country, except for maybe England, is implementing this neo-feudalistic form
of serfdom.
And that's the UN's own words. They've called for a fake environmentalism to bring in serfdom
to control the population. So that's coming up. Now, we are going to open the phones up
and take your phone calls here today as well. Yesterday, on the Sunday broadcast, I said
that I was going to cover the mysterious death of Chris Kyle, the highly decorated Navy SEAL,
who was involved in all sorts of clandestine black ops, obviously, and wrote the Navy's
official sniper manual, their new sniper manual.
They didn't have one previous to that. They used the Marine Corps sniper manual. But he
wrote an updated manual, and he was deep into the system, obviously, and was the head trainer
for the Navy SEALs in their sharpshooting program. We saw the Navy SEALs helicopter
and SEAL Team 6 blow up with 20-something of them aboard. We saw the other helicopter
blow up in the fake bin Laden raid.
So much of this is domestic shy ops. And the SEALs more and more are used as a political
core with the new SEAL Team 6 Zero Dark Thirty movie, which they admit is basically fiction.
We're being bombarded with lies. And I gotta tell you, the fact that he was pushing to
put guns in schools and armed teachers, and the fact that he knew so many secrets, and
then somebody he takes up to the range with PTSD trying to help him.
That's the story we're told. We don't know if any of this is true. We're being told this
by the government, and then he's killed. You see, I'm not a conspiracy theorist in the
way the media uses it. When known liars, certified liars, who've been caught lying over and over
and over again and caught staging things, tell me something, I don't just immediately
believe it.
That doesn't mean the official story isn't true, because sometimes you get people who
are not corrupt in the system, or it's a real event. Sometimes the truth comes out because
you've got good people in media, good people in government, and it's not a staged event.
And so you'll have regular folks involved.
But when it is a staged event, you'll see key players involved and key scripting, and
you'll see an official story being put out very, very quickly. And the shaping immediately
and the preparation and the unification of the propaganda is a telltale sign. We saw
that with the Aurora shooting in Colorado, and then all the other telltale signs.
And we do see it in Sandy Hook to a great extent. I believe there was a shooting there.
It's like we say there's an inside job on 9-11. That just means criminal elements of
the globalist structure somehow open the door, allowed it to happen, ordered stand downs.
We know that happened. We know the official story's a lie. Does it mean there aren't quote
Muslim extremists?
But see, the system comes out and has their operatives say, there were no planes. And
the originator of that, it later turned out, worked for the CIA. Very strange. See, so
when I say there could be government involvement or criminal involvement by other actors, yet
Sandy Hook, the spin is, you're saying nobody died. No, I'm saying people did die.
But there's clear scripting and things. So it's a complex issue, but we're gonna be getting
into that. The power outage, it appeared to be staged by yours truly. They're getting
you ready, and they've said this, to have more and more power outages across America.
This is gonna be a new way of life, just as it was in Romania under Ceausescu. So we're
gonna break that down as well. In the latest Second Amendment news, it is all key.
Looking back on 2012, I know personally I'm thanking God that my family and I made it
through the year. From natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer
drought to the family hardships brought on by a disastrous economy. Our hearts go out
to those that have lost everything. My friends at eFoods Direct hear from customers every
day that are fortunate to weather life's storm by having a supply of food on hand. Danny
from New York City wrote in following Hurricane Sandy and said, Almost all the grocery stores
are closed, but I managed to get my eFoods just in time to be able to help my sister
and my niece. Bottom line, it's better to be prepared 10 years too early than one day
too late. Feed common sense as warning and do what I've done. Call 800-409-5633 today

Alex Jones.
Don't tread on me. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this live Monday
edition. Marines to invade South Carolina. That is just the daily news as large expeditionary
forces of the army, the Marines, the TSA, you name it. Practice taking over capital
buildings, practice taking over schools, practice taking over malls. And I have been to many
of these urban warfare training events, but we also see it now currently reported in the
news.
In many of the drills they practice mowing down human wave attacks. They are simulating
killing, in some cases, unarmed American citizens. And when the public videotapes it and gets
upset, they say, it's a zombie drill. It's a joke. That's why we've got 1000 Marines
landing in San Diego a few months ago to practice killing zombies. That's why there's black
helicopters that lease a building in the middle of town and then blow it up and catch it on
fire and men are repelling down off ropes and the police are involved. It's all to acclimate
and condition the public on record for martial law.
It's all official in the army training manuals, in the army times, in Stars and Stripes, brigade
homeland since 2008 has been officially announced. And they plan to have troop force up to 370
plus thousand troops, that is the goal. And they're gonna pull them out of Iraq, out of
Afghanistan, and they're gonna be the new domestic military.
And you're going to have Obama, we have a clip of that coming up in a moment, running
around, giving more speeches saying, we need a domestic security force, just as big, just
as strong as our military. You've all seen and heard that quote over and over and over
again. And we should do another special report this week showing top brass talking about
it on C-SPAN.
The Pentagon talking about it in Pentagon videos online. You've got not just Rahm Emanuel
in two different speeches saying you'll have national service. But now you're seeing all
these other groups pushing for it and they're telling high schoolers, hey, it's gonna be
compulsory that you serve in the new FEMA Corps.
But it's not gonna be planting trees. It's not gonna be building national park bunk houses
like they had in the 30s and 40s with the national make work programs. It's gonna be
unpaid compulsory volunteerism, which is another Orwellian term. This is the insanity of the
world that we live in.
Look at this other article up at infoawars.com. Robots replace waiters in China. That's right.
They're not just going to replace manufacturing jobs and have robots working on the robots.
No, now they're going to replace people as waiters. And again, the globalist have decided
to go with this angle to make humans obsolete.
To make humans obsolete, to fully get control of the civilization, and to have a technocratic
centralized system. And people say, this is a terrible future you're telling us about.
I'm not the one manifesting this. The globalist are engineering it in that direction. We're
gonna be going over that report.
Reuters report contradicts Obama skeet shooting photo. I don't even know what to say about
this other than it's definitely a shy up. And this is cognitive dissonance that Cass
Sunstein talked about and that Cass Sunstein engaged in, what, four years ago in public
white papers. And that's why he was hired and brought into the White House. He's now
left the White House for four years.
He was the head of their policy board. He was the czar, the regulation czar. I know
shotguns. And I have photographed and videotaped, even as a novice before I had a TV show, firing
shotguns and firing rifles and firing handguns over and over again. And I can tell you right
now, that looks like a fake photo to me.
And I actually noticed that first there's a controversy that, he doesn't really skeet
shooter like guns, which they kinda stirred up. And then the White House over the weekend,
and I'm gonna cover this, I have it here in the stack once we get over some of the top
news. The White House comes out and says, don't you claim this isn't real?
And then another little comment, they say, by the way, this is copyright, no one is allowed
to Photoshop this. This is only for media. Knowing that that will stir people up and
make them go out and Photoshop it. And by the way, I've looked at the precedent, I've
looked at the law, White House photos are public domain, you paid for it.
That's why you can go to the National Archives and just pay for the copying, pay for the
cost of copying and the tape, or now the hard drive, and get all of the gun pod footage,
get all of the hydrogen bombs going off. Companies take it and then remaster it and then call
it copyright, or the voiceover is copyright on Discovery Channel or History Channel, but
not the footage.
And so I've actually looked into this, I've actually purchased National Archive film.
I've actually, you have to actually get it through another company or go and you have
to send someone in with the archivist and that's how you buy it and get it. So I've
actually been through the process, I know. Why would they come out and say, you will
not use this, you will not Photoshop that?
Cass Sunstein said, we'll go in and stir them up, we'll put out fake conspiracies. We'll
get everybody hyped up, we'll get everybody diverted, we'll get everybody to look at fake
conspiracy theories or conspiracy theories that don't matter.
He wrote two papers on it, one for Chicago Business School, the Neocon outfit, and one
for Harvard, look them up. He wrote them six years ago and then wrote more papers when
he got in the White House in 2009. I mean, just look it up, Cass Sunstein, cognitive
infiltration.
I always say cognitive dissonance, it's cognitive infiltration. And that's what they're doing
here. They put out a blatantly fake birth certificate, show that we'd run around and
talk about it all day knowing the public would just choose sides or get confused. While the
insider trading goes on by Congress, while the UN openly is in command of our military
along with NATO, while our government publicly arms and commands al-Qaeda in Libya and Syria
and Mali and a bunch of other places.
LTSA occupies every major city from Seattle to LA to Dallas, Austin, Texas, Houston, Texas,
Kansas City, Chicago, New York City, Boston, you name it. You name it, they're there. I
mean, they're now there with quote spot checks on South Lamar at the bus terminals and the
train terminals, but they also are doing it to people on the highway now.
And it's totally illegal, and they search everybody's bags without warrants. And they're
out of their jurisdiction, and it's all just a probing operation. And that ties in to this
information that's coming up. Why is the government stockpiling guns and ammo? Joseph Farah, Worldnet
Daily asked. And he says, why is the government gearing up for war?
Why are they buying billions of bullets? Why are they buying only automatic weapons? Why
are they buying armored vehicles? He says it's about the civilian National Security
Force as big, as strong, as well-funded as the Defense Department, to quote Barack Obama.
And Farah says that's what he believes is going on. He says, I have some theories. Those
of us that have been right all along need to stop saying we have theories. I'm gonna
get Joseph Farah back on. I'm gonna get him back on this week or next week, because it's
all there.
It's like you walk into your living room, there's a giant elephant sitting there on
top of a pile of crap, excuse my French. And you're like, I don't know, I got a theory,
that looks like an elephant. You're like, well, it's got big ears, it's just a gray,
it's got hair, it's got giant feet, it's got cusks. I don't know, though. Look, it's all
in the army memos, the army manuals.
Maybe Farah's just a good writer and he knows people like a mystery. I notice everybody
always calls me with, I think there's a FEMA camp in my neighborhood. I mean, under the
Model States Health Emergency Powers Act, they designate the centers. And then you can
cross-reference it with the Emergency Centers Establishment Act that just was giving more
funding to already existing facilities and plans.
And then it matches up to the 2002 FEMA plan. And you can look up all the clergy response
team training, what they're training the preachers for, to quote, go to the FEMA camp, take the
shots, turn your guns in when you're told, this is all official. And then five years,
four years after we break the news here on Genesis, it's mainstream media, and InfraGuard,
and Brigade Homeland, and Army Times, and all the countless drills.
And I've talked to the Delta Force people off record. They talked to Lieutenant Beck
here in town. He gave me info, so they ran him out of the SWAT team. Vietnam veteran,
patriot, great guy, ran him out, kicked him out of the Travis County SWAT team because
he gave me information that was not classified.
I went in his office two years before and I said, you're gonna be approached by Delta
Force. And when they do, you need to understand it's illegal. And they're gonna offer you
money. And this is part of a corruption program, just like they corrupt third world countries.
That's how they took over Iraq. And I said, next, they're gonna be asking you to deal
drugs. And he said, get out of here. That's posse comitatus. I'm a Vietnam sniper vet.
That's unconstitutional. It'll never happen. You're nuts. And I said, they're approaching
every city in the country. They will approach you. He calls me up two years ago, just can
you come in my office, please? Delta Force card, everything he said I said was, of course
I'm right. I know what I'm talking about. This is martial law.
Looking back on 2012, I know personally I'm thanking God that my family and I made it

Alex Jones here back live. I'm going to open the phones up on the Super Bowl power outage.
What do you think that was all about? I've got some news concerning it, it's pretty amazing.
I'm going to get to, even mainstream news is reporting is an Illuminati conspiracy.
Because the singer flashes an Illuminati hand sign and then the power goes out. And it's
just all part of them extending it out, having more time for ads and getting everybody ready
for the power to start going out. In fact, in Europe and worldwide, they have Earth Day
where everybody turns their lights out.
For the day, for the evening, for one hour, they have a lot of different special greeny
holidays where they want to accustom you to, everybody has their power go out. Because
only the government districts are going to have the power. And see, for a new listener
it's like, man, is everything a conspiracy with this guy?
I have so much knowledge on this, it's very frustrating. I'm not bragging, hey, I have
knowledge. It's freaking me out that the general public doesn't have 1 one hundredth of the
information I have. Because you're focused on making money and doing your job and trying
to take care of your kids and trying to have a good life.
I don't blame you, I get it. You work hard, you want to go watch a football game. You
work hard, you want to be left alone. You work hard, you want to go get in your sports
car and go drive 100 miles an hour out in the countryside. I get it. You work hard,
you want to go out and go water skiing or you want to go out and have some fun, go out
and party.
The problem is we've been taken over and things are going to get very, very bad. But as things
get worse and worse, people are going to say, well, let me just have my entertainment. Just
leave me alone. In fact, statistics and history shows, as things get worse, people tend to
get even more into entertainment and more into escapism.
And the social engineers know that. But what they can't get over is tribal images and archetypes
and signants, runes of power. And that's what guns are, that's what property is, that's
what parenthood is. It's real things like weapons and children and property. This is
all real.
And they can't get rid of that last little pieces, the family, men and women, and their
desire for one another. Friendship, people standing up for one another. That's why all
the messages are don't stand up for people, screw other people, cheat other people. Get
ahead, get ahead, show that you're all atomized and can't come together.
I mean, when I get up here and say the Super Bowl power outage looks staged, you have to
understand, ladies and gentlemen, that I know. In fact, I wanna do a special report on this.
It's just that I wanna do a special report on everything. I wanna document everything
and every article I cover. Every one of these 200 articles is probably more than, can we
have a document, guys?
There's probably 200 different articles here. Every one of them I could spend three hours
on and then give you supporting backup information on each and every one of them, proving why
I believe what I believe, why I say what I say, what I'm going over, what I'm breaking
down, okay? I mean, here's an example. I have the UN proclamations in the 1960s and 70s
saying they wanted to train people to not have electricity and to not expect electricity
24 hours a day and to not accept running water and to not accept things.
And that the globalist could charge us more money for a gallon of water than for 10,000
gallons of it. And that society was set up wrong and that wealth was making us too free
and the social engineers were going to lose control of technological development and their
global monopoly of power if they didn't bring the general population back into feudal serfdom.
And that's why all the trendy resorts and all the trendy restaurants all over the country
and other countries I've been to, you go in and they're not low flush toilets. There is
no water. They're not low flush urinals. There is no water. And you're at a five star restaurant
and the bathroom stinks like a gas station because the urine's going down into a cistern
below that gets processed and turned into fertilizer and stuff, okay?
They make it trendy to be a slave. Just like the ancient Chinese emperors, they were told
it's stylish to not be able to walk. It's stylish to not be able to feed yourself. And
the ruling power behind the throne fully took over. This is the system. They tell you it's
stylish to be a slave. They tell you it's stylish not to be manly. They tell you it's
stylish not to be a classical mother.
They tell you all of this not to empower you but to enslave you. So see, I know this was
a stunt. I know in my gut and I know their MO. 99% chance, okay? 99% chance because I
happen to remember other stunts where they had official sporting events go dark in the
past and I predict next Super Bowl they'll say, we're now going to make this a tradition
to have the power go out. Watch, we come back.
There on the march, the empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

We are on the march. The empire is on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
All right, finishing up. Before I give out the number and get into some other news, then
go to your phone calls. They were billing the Super Bowl as the most green friendly
ever. But green friendly for me means not having genetically modified organisms being
manufactured by the thousand every year, not having human genetics put into sheep, cows,
you name it, so that you can then have cross-species zoological transference of pathogens, bacteria
and virus. And it gives rise to dangerous mutations, not having toxic waste dumped in
our food supply, not having dangerous experiments going on with any matter.
These are the things that could actually destroy the planet, destroy us. Not carbon dioxide
plants breathe, not where it's bad to have electricity, it's bad to flush your toilet.
When all your toilet does if you have say a septic system is send it out through a bacteria
tank and then sends fertilized water out to your green yard, creating a recycled ecosystem.
It's all renewable. Humans are bad, humans are evil. You're saying how do I know this
was staged?
Well, I went back and reviewed the video right before it happened. I saw the way they were
behaving some of the things they did right when it happened, the way they behaved once
it unfolded. Most people obviously weren't in on it, but it's all about to see if they
can get away with it.
And how do I know this? Well, the UN has called for this. In fact, guys, we use search engine
Enron staged blackouts. And then you all hear about it on Earth Day and World Day and all
these other days they have where simultaneously nations turn their lights out.
They're getting you trained. And Enron said in its internal memos that came out in the
federal trial that, well, we found if we cut the power, it creates the artificial perception
of scarcity. The perception so that we can have artificial scarcity. Yeah, there's Wall
Street Journal.
Enron linked to California blackouts. Traders said manipulation began energy crisis. Yeah.
And then it came out in the federal court. That's from 2002. It came out that they would
do it. And some days they'd make $1 billion extra, some weeks $3 or $4 billion extra all
over the West Coast, but mainly in California, saying there isn't enough power.
There isn't enough power. My gosh, okay, you want power? You went without power for six
hours today, Los Angeles. We're gonna have to charge you more. Give me my power then.
All right, it's free market. Truth is they had a glut of power. The truth is they were
telling their switching stations, calling them on the phone, because all these people
weren't conspirators.
They were just told by Enron that had the contracts over the agreement. Okay, start
cutting power over the next 24 hours, cut it down to almost nothing. I mean, they have
to build the grid up, have actuaries of how much is gonna be used, prepare and guess with
computers. In the old days, they did it with big thick pads of paper, and they would sit
there and guess, okay, this time of year, generally this much power gets used.
We know when it gets hot, they're gonna use more air conditioners. We know when it's cold,
okay, this many people on average have electric power. They're not using a gas or, okay, we
have this much power used last year, we guess there's gonna be that much. And then if there's
extra power, it has to then be stored in big giant batteries and other systems.
That power is destructive, it will blow things up. They've got it all dialed in. And the
Soviets would do this in their satellites to control people. Romanian places, they had
policies to just get it to where there were a couple hours of power a day, and then only
select factories and government buildings, they had power 24 hours a day.
And they're already setting up the actuaries. See, I've studied this issue. I've talked
to people that work as engineers in scores of power plants. I've talked to plant managers.
I've researched it at every level. I've got a lot of family that works in power plant
management and power storage. Yeah, tapes reveal Enron's secret role in California Power
Blackhouse, London Guardian, boom.
See, and this is one stinking data point. I have hundreds. Do you know what it's like
to be sure of their criminal activity and not be able to stop them? But see, you know
they want your guns to enslave you. People saw it worldwide and they've seen it in cities
these globalist mafia people run.
So see on that one issue, you know not to trust them so they're not victorious. Even
though they're trying everything they got to go after our guns, and they're trying to
launch out of control outside of law purges against gun owners, it still doesn't matter
because on one issue, you're not backing down, you're angry, you're upset, and you're not
gonna play games, okay?
All you've got to do is figure out their scam on every other issue and it's over, okay?
It's over. Let me continue. In fact, I'm gonna do a report on this. I could show you right
now. It would just take the whole hour. Type in UN calls for controlled blackouts to lower
carbon footprint.
Type in carbon footprint is a depression is good for a carbon footprint. You can go read
the UN admitting that the mega banks are engineering this, but it's all in academic level above
PhD. You don't get taught this stuff at the London School of Economics. You don't get
taught this stuff at Harvard.
You don't get taught this stuff at Yale. I've interviewed people. There's only one a year
that goes through the special Rockefeller Foundation program that Henry Kissinger was
the first graduate of to be a super gopher for them. You don't go through that until
you've got two PhDs and are selected.
And I have interviewed one of the people who's got that special above PhD level degree. Francis
Boyle, constitutional lawyer. Dr. Boyle, professor, who they've got on a no fly list. He's not
even allowed to fly. They hate him so much cuz he turned against him. He got all the
way to the highest level, played along with them, and they let him into all of it.
This is how it works. Major universities may graduate five of these people a year, okay?
And it's Chicago business, it's Yale, it's Harvard, it's Princeton. The University of
Texas has got the former NSA head running it. They're hatching them out. And Aaron Dykes
got into the political science higher level, not the highest level.
But they were wanting to go for his PhD and stuff cuz he had high grades. And he got right
up in there and it was, yeah, world government's real. We're gonna get rid of the family, everything
else. I mean, my dad got into the lower mid levels of this and they all told him. Folks,
this is an absolute 100% fact, okay?
They turned the power off at the Super Bowl to get you ready for more power outages. Remember
my article two years ago? Thedrudgereport.com picked up and went viral everywhere and the
White House, Jay Carney, responded. I guess it was a year and a half ago when he first
got in there and replaced the other idiot, Gibbs.
And they responded, so that's ridiculous. There's not gonna be rolling blackouts cuz
of us. We're not shutting down power plants, even though they already shut down a couple
hundred. Texas now has rolling blackouts when it gets colder, when it gets hot. We have
to buy the power from Mexico, dirty plants, the globalist don't.
And there it is, depression good for reducing carbon emissions. Bloomberg, that's an Infowars.com
article. But if you click Bloomberg, that blue link right there, it'll show you. And
the UN says, use public events in their, pull it up. They say, we will use public events
to turn the power off to teach everyone it's good and we will ritualize not having running
water, not having electricity.
They're going to turn your electricity off. You're not going to have it. In the actuary
agreements in San Francisco and Austin and Okinawa, these sister model UN cities under
immunization plans, just go look it up. Austin special model UN city, thousands of pages,
UN website. They say the central governing districts and the central governing zoning
areas will never lose power.
That's why all the elite where I live, doesn't matter there's houses 10 times as big, outside
town for cheaper. They move into little bitty houses in Tarrytown. I say little bitty, little
bitty for these people, billionaires are down there. They move into three and four and five
bedroom houses, because that's where the police protection zone is.
You've heard the police calling and confirm this. The police captains know where the special
zones are at. Those places will not have their power cut off. The reason they're tearing
up the roads and putting in bus lanes and stuff and bike lanes is they're going to shut
everything off in the future.
They're not playing games is my point. You understand what it's like to know of this
criminal activity? A bunch of seedy slime bags playing God because we stand down and
let them run all over us. The UN maps presented in Congress, I'm showing one on screen right
now, half the country, right at half, completely off limits.
And folks in Burma and other areas, I saw it in 1999. I've got to find it, it was about
Asia, and it showed UN zones, biosphere zones, and it showed men with machine guns who shoot
anyone that enters them. They kill you if you enter it. They're already doing this in
Africa and Latin America.
Look it up, even the New York Times, African people and others and Latin Americans are
being killed for UN programs to quote, reclaim land to the earth, kicking people off their
ancestral land, forcing them into giant megacities, to then work for two cents an hour. And then
the government says, guess what, just get sterilized, do this and that, and we will
give you $5,000, the equivalent of what they'd make in three or four or five years, and they
do it.
You're like, good, sterilize them, there's too many people. You idiots, you idiot yuppies.
You're not white racists, cuz that's not what they are. They're on power trips like they're
scientists and they've been let in on the program, because it is, everybody's let in
on it.
You go to any cocktail party, even just mainline people that don't even have their four year
science degree yet, and start talking about, we need to get rid of people, we need to reduce
population and they'll start singing from the same sheet of music. Don't you get it,
you morons, they're putting it in your food, they're putting it in your water, they're
putting it in your air, they're soft killing you as well.
They just can't do it as openly and as fast because we have something of a free press
left that would report on it. I mean, I remember two years ago, I saw major pro-life sites
that are highly respected saying, Pepsi is using aborted fetus body parts to produce
specially grown cultured flavor enhancer.
It's basically a genetically engineered flavor, they wanna be able to just drop a vial of
it into a soup and ferment the flavor, okay? Just like aspartame is E. coli. And I saw
that and I said, that's not true, and I went looked it up and it was true. And then the
Obama administration ruled for PepsiCo that the shareholders didn't have to be told where
the babies were coming from.
And then it all came out, in fact, you can even type in, it happened last year, PepsiCo
agrees to stop using fetal tissue. People didn't believe it, I didn't believe it, but
actually I should have believed it, I already knew it. They had cloned humans 20 years ago,
they just don't call it a human because they kill the baby before it's born.
They grow them in artificial wombs and then they say it's not a human because it was changed.
They add 1% pig, 1% cow, 1%, look this up, this has already been going on for 20 years.
And then it's not a human and it's not a clone, they give it other semantical names and then
they suck them dry and use them. Yeah, PepsiCo says it will halt use of aborted fetal cells
in flavor research, it's also in the Washington Times.
And they go, technically, we're not feeding you babies, we grow the culture out of the
stem cell line from the dead babies. That's right, that's right, for whatever reason,
I guess I gotta admit veal tastes really good. Something about baby flesh tastes pretty good.
When I go out and I go hunting, if I'm gonna shoot something, it isn't a big buck, I'm
gonna shoot a yearling doe and I'm gonna take it and I'm gonna have it cut into steaks.
If I hunt, if I hunt to eat it, if I see a big ugly old jackrabbit, I'm not going, that
thing's gonna have fleas all over them and it tastes like, but if I see a little fluffy
jackrabbit hopping around, my 22-250 is gonna shoot you about 200 yards and I'm gonna eat
you.
Back when I had time to be a woodsman and do such things like that, my true love, it's
any man's true love, you ever go out and do it. And so it's sick, you're eating a flavor
enhancement from a baby, from a baby and you don't even care. Just like they have suicide
nets, not just at Foxconn, but dozens of other, I mean, I don't know, I looked at them something
like 30 major companies have built in China around their dorm suicide nets.
And they're saying, don't worry, Foxconn said, we're just gonna go to robots, but they still
need human technicians to work on the robots. See, they don't need us, they don't want us,
they took the world over through fraud and they're coming for everyone.
And they've had other global soccer games, type in power turned off, lights go dark at
soccer game to mark Earth Day, just type that in, I wanna show them. This is the program,
I know them, they have blueprints, they have handbooks. And so once their robot armies
are in place, robot engineers, robot sewer repair, robot street repair, robot security,
robot combat, once that's all in, and we're only talking five to ten years, they're gonna
probably let it go a little bit further than that to make sure all systems are good.
They're going to launch a Skynet attack on us, but it's not gonna be nuclear, it's gonna
be biological and chemical. And that it's humans running Skynet, okay? And again, you
can pull this up in the 70s, the Pentagon called it and it's actually in my book, that's
out of print now, but it's on prisonplanet.tv and m4news.com. They actually call it Skynet
and a control grid.
See, people see this info who are in Hollywood and in between the CIA and Hollywood that's
like two peas in a pod, and then they put the culture out to get you ready. But it's
not machines coming commanded by machines, it is elite globalists who believe they're
going to merge with the machines.
They believe the evolutionary path has already been predestined, they've chosen this path.
They have chosen the best possible path to immortality is cybernetic merger. And they're
offering the greatest intelligentsia of the world entree into that system if they will
serve it. Number one, you reap what you sow, you're not going to get this immortality.
Number two, it's horrible what you're doing. And number three, you can't trust the globalists
that engineered this thing. You think they're going to let people like you stay around that
are a lot smarter than them? Do you think they're going to keep you around? You are
gravely mistaken. This is not good.
We should offer the technology to everyone. We should be honest about what's going on
and we should have giant global initiatives that are accepted at the nation state level
and accepted and voted on by the people of goals of off world colonies and bring out
all this technology and be honest about it.
And we can people the stars together. But I'm telling you that that decision has been
cut off. That is not happening. That is not the direction we're going. You're slated for
death. And as soon as their grids in place, they're going to release the bio weapons and
the chemical weapons and all of you people that have served the system and think you're
part of it.
You're going to die. I hope you understand that's the program. That's the plan. And I've
warned you and I've warned you and it's why I'm not worried about getting killed or being
put in prison. There's no future if we don't turn this around. And we need to have an intervention
with ourselves and realize this system and what people think about you and all the TV
and the culture.
It means nothing. Sitting there, I brought by a party last night when I was invited to
it was a nice group of people. And I just watched him and a lot of more listeners. Super
Bowl party was at a restaurant. They shut down for the party. And I watched all these
nice people.
Steiner Steakhouse. And I watched all these people sit there and watch the watch the the
fake thing rolled out for them, whereas they all were having a lot more fun before we stop
and sort of watching the game. Well, it doesn't matter. Attention gardeners and patriots drought

all right when we start the next hour I'll start taking your phone calls he's popping
in for one segment we've got the author of the fixes in he says one of the most corrupt
outfits is the NFL staging things and he's been in the FBI files it's been documented
the question is how much is staged well how much will you put up with he's going to pop
in to give us his take on the power outage with the game in general because if I talk
about the Super Bowl and then use it as a way to get people to think about larger issues
we can take a globalist tool of propaganda and actually turn it around against them here's
something I want to get across to you the decision has been made at MIT the United Nations
the club of Rome the Bilderberg group anyone who reads science magazines knows this 15
years ago I was reading white papers where they said this was the plan and those were
white papers from decades before in some cases but I'd never seen it in Scientific American
I'd never seen it in the Journal of Nature I'd never seen it in MIT magazine now they're
going no there will be no need for humans and we don't know what to do with you and
everything will be robotic and the elites are going to merge with machines and the decision
has basically been that we're not even going to have humans deployed to space and the manned
space program is over and everything is robots that is a decision that humans are obsolete
humans are a failure humans are a joke and the globalists are going to take full control
of human evolution in their words and think of what a total revolution that is where they
just ignore what we want they ignore what we say they put out a fake Hollywood sports
system they suck everyone into it while above us a technocratic matrix engineer core is
trying to build a matrix we're not in total false reality yet they put out fake shotgun
photos they do Illuminati signs right before they turn the power off you know Janet Jackson
it was an accident my breast came out with the Illuminati Sun sign on her I mean all
staged oh was it staged gee did a bear go in the woods and go to the bathroom do fish
live in the water I mean again they do it all to just exercise authority over us where
they publicly run al-qaeda and admit they do but say you've got to give your liberties
up because of al-qaeda they just publicly do all of this to where even those of us that
know it's going on it's kind of like oh well I knew TSA checkpoints were coming oh there's
one oh they're gonna search me they've got guns now oh oh it's for my safety oh sure
it is yeah it's looking for drugs which the government is on record shipping the majority
of in and and even the TSA all laugh and go hi no hi this is our job again it's about
following orders oh you've got a bubble thing that projects bubbles we're gonna call it
a gun and call the SWAT team a Hello Kitty well that's ridiculous it's meant to be ridiculous
it's meant to just turn everything on its head until everything if the government's
totally secret but you have no privacy that's backwards government's supposed to be wide
open you've got total privacy unless there's an eyewitness naming the place person and
things shining and affidavit swearing they saw this and if they're liars they're going
to jail that's what you've got to do to spy on me that's what you've got to do to come
in my house that's what you've got to do to put your hands on my person but now oh no

cover but about i don't know 10 of it i've got to get to what i think happened with chris
kyle the uh i mean how crazy is come on you know that smells come on come on the timing
that guy of all people i mean what is the probability something's going on um or maybe
it is that they've had people serve five six seven ters and put them on psychotropics this
guy was under psychiatric care and the government did it to him that way either i mean it's
government whether they staged it or not i mean we see extraordinary craziness happen
because it's crazy and it's going to get crazier all the more reason we should have water filters
guns be prepared try to move to the suburbs at least try to move out in the country if
you can that's what all the elite are doing but when we do it oh it's weird uh he he's
he's got guns and he's he's concerned about his security and uh and they even told their
kids don't trust the government i'm sorry i i don't trust the government anymore because
at the top it's run by bad people and more and more i see it trickling down more and
more even if people in the government don't like it they're following unconstitutional
orders they're following unconstitutional orders
and i understand sometimes it isn't a perfect world or you know the nobody's perfect but
i mean the system is really corrupt and don't you instinctively working for the system not

2013 we've got a guest coming up the author of the Fix is In Brian Toohey is going to
be coming on to get his take on the Super Bowl the power outage that looked pretty darn
staged even Yahoo Sports says did Illuminati sign was it a signal that it the power was
to go out how do you pronounce that woman's name I'm embarrassed I don't even know the
name of these pop idiots Beyonce that's what I thought did Beyonce flash and Illuminati
sign why did the Superdome power go out your Super Bowl mysteries solved so we're going
to be going over that and again all a conspiracy theorist is now is someone who questions known
liars in corporate globalist media and in a corrupt government now because people lost
total faith in the system it doesn't mean that everybody out there with their own theory
is right it doesn't mean all the alternative media is right it doesn't mean that I'm always
right we're all imperfect creatures but we know the system has an authoritarian bent
and a goal that it's pushing Reuters report contradicts Obama skeet shooting photo story
said Obama played golf on August 4th retired for dinner and I gotta say Cass Sunstein the
White House said we'll do cognitive infiltration we'll put out our own ridiculous conspiracy
theories that are actually true but don't matter to just get everyone fighting over
something and this doesn't look like any shotgun blast I've ever seen it looks like a smoke
pop gun or something and I'm not saying Obama would you shoot a gun Obama's all about guns
he's a gangster he's a globalist but just like they put out a fake birth certificate
to get us all debating about it and then it turns out no he really was probably born in
Hawaii but to a famous communist and they did cover up where he came from and have sealed
his records and he had all these other different names and his mother was into all this weird
stuff and that's why they say in his Harvard dissertation and when he was the head of the
law review and just scores of publications he said for 17 years he was born in Kenya
his wife said it and all that is to tantalize us they know that they throw that out they
know that's a lie there's so many lies you can't get to the truth because it's just lies
on lies on lies on lies during the break we had Fox News on out there and I saw Obama
getting off Air Force One with Al Franken and I saw the Air Force officer walk over
and greet them and everyone's sycophantically looking at them and groveling and Obama's
getting off on the narcissistic power trip Al Franken is shaking with pleasure I remember
reading about how Dennis Kucinich sold out on Obamacare and a bunch of other stuff so
that so that he could get a ride on Air Force One I mean are we peacocks or are we humans
are we preening sycophantic peacocks I guess a lot of us are and I looked at everyone there
they they were just getting off on the power getting off and the Air Force officer was
Mr. President a bunch of sycophants and the Marines were getting off on it and Franken
it was all a big joke what a big armored Cadillac and a Air Force One so you can shell out humanity
and feel powerful about yourselves the stars are in the sky the universe incredible beauty
your family your children everything good literature art these politicians and people
they're not rock stars you know the reason people have admired literature and artists
and actors and philosophers is because they do offer something beautiful music beautiful
plays ideas they express things that touch our soul and build us up Shakespeare deserves
to be admired you may say they're you know evil or whatever it doesn't matter the point
is it's beautiful things like Led Zeppelin Beethoven and and different things touch different
people that I would be giddy to be around somebody like Robert Plant not because he's
a celebrity but because his voice has touched me so many times do you understand the difference
and but then it's strange when you admire someone you then don't want to meet them because
that would that would damage the the the the spiritual relationship understand the difference
of what I'm saying here like I know where Robert Plant goes every week at a certain
time here in Austin I would never go there to try to meet him and I'm not some big fan
of Robert Plant it's just I'm trying to think who do what I want to meet I would want to
meet somebody like Mother Teresa who helped people I would want to meet Ernest Borgnine
which I had a chance to do was too busy and didn't do because I'm just not into it who
Ted Knight I would love there you go I think I've said that Ted Knight you don't know who
Ted Knight is oh don't fire me Lou look I said I'd go to your calls the point is that
we're selling out for nothing in fact you guys actually taped it can you show when they
get to the bottom of the game a gangplank walking down the steps they're off Air Force
One and just the the the the faces they're making again if you're a radio listener you
obviously can't see this but I'm showing it to TV viewers who are watching over info wars
news.com and it just shows all of the satisfaction and I know the looks on faces those aren't
looks of oh it's an exciting day or we just heard a funny joke or we're going somewhere
really cool it's like we're with the cool president who's jogging we're all out here
in the power structure you know we're I mean the Secret Service are all into their get-ups
they're they're they're black trench coats and their submachine guns under them and see
they don't like the fact that we have guns you see they want the exclusivity of having
electricity and you're not going to have it they're going to turn your electricity off
but in the government district they're going to have it they're going to be allowed to
have kids you're not they're going to go places and fly over you and fly over country while
you cling your Bibles because you're not going to have your guns they say you're bitter clingers
you don't like them you're not in on the delusion and it's so incredibly empty it's so incredibly
empty that's why I can't bring myself even though we're doing it building big fancy sets
and going and getting fitted for a bunch of fancy suits but I've got to do it because
if it'll get people to listen to what I'm saying so I can warn them I will wear a waiter
outfit I will wear a high signet power in fact I was even thinking about it and then
was amazed to see another talk show us do it where we could build a fake Oval Office
and sit there and Brian broadcast from that and then everyone would fall down and do whatever
I said but I don't want to manipulate through symbols I want you to become aware of the
manipulation and become really conscious so that humanity can be risen up instead of driven
down but just watching the faces of the just cringing with shaking with the power trip
of we're exclusive we're here we've made it we've arrived and I've noticed all these sycophants
is the same looks in North Korea and I've watched old film reels of other dictatorships
and things going back a hundred years the people all look at the dictator or look at
the puppet because through that they get their reflective power they have people that then
under them look at them with this weird sycophantic strangeness I can't stand it people do it
to me and it's just like pathetic I mean I would have loved to have met Stanley
Kubrick I would have loved to have met Ernest Hemingway not that I even agree with his politics
but his writing touched my heart his writing told things that I'd experience a different
ways and I communed with his soul the truth is humans aren't pathetic failed creatures
one side of this is but the globalists want to put us artificially into that we need to
reach for the stars ladies and gentlemen all right I got a bunch of news coming up I said
I'd go to your calls Eric in Colorado you're on the air you want to comment on the Super
Bowl go ahead he dropped off okay let's go to Darren in Florida news reports and daughters
meds okay go ahead well Alex can you hear me yes I can yes I wanted to first talk about
Chris Kyle if I might the sniper go ahead okay sir because of what's been going on and
listening to you and thanks ditto from what everybody says a great job you're doing I've
begun to see a lot of things I hadn't really paid attention to before and my son who's
in the ROTC called me late Saturday night to tell me about Chris Kyle I just couldn't
believe it so yesterday morning before church I got up and started looking at all the all
the news the local news paying very good attention to the local news that I could and I started
noticing some inconsistencies right off and I wanted to review them real quick with you
if I could and your listeners one the initial reports were saying that the suspect was was
witnessed they heard gunshots about between three thirty four o'clock and then they saw
someone driving off in a truck but no one actually saw the suspect shoot him this the
second news thing came later saying that a hunter came to the lodge at five o'clock and
found him dead well that's a pretty big inconsistency right there even more important the initial
reports on fox five news and I listed the news but that's immaterial stated that he
was apprehended on a stretch of highway I believe it was I-35 by Camp Wisdom Road and
they showed they showed the cameras there on the police cars in the dark with the lights
flashing however just like Sandy Hook they were not allowed to go up and view the person
that they had in custody in the vehicle they said they got him out of the truck he's in
the vehicle but the news persons were not allowed to show the guy's face on the camera
listen listen the whole thing's suspicious what's the chance that Chris Kyle who's definitely
involved in psyops against the American people but highly decorated ends up getting killed
the whole thing is very very very suspicious I'm gonna come back and let you finish those
points then we'll go to all the rest of the callers we got Nick in Ireland who wants to
talk about the hostage crisis stay with us

the only one you've got it looks like something out of central casting you've got the most
deadly sniper in US history self-billed a guy who in his book I'm not trying to run
a dead guy down but you know I've had my problems and I've talked to Chris Kyle at length
and being sued by Ventura he admitted in his book that he had lied to people about other
stuff changed his story about Ventura later said it was outside nobody had basically seen
it he has no witnesses Ventura has all these witnesses that it never happened the lawsuit
was going forward and this guy was high up and he was published by a division of News
Corp it was going to come out who put him up to this this psi up against Ventura and
I talked to him at length on the Opie and Anthony show and he sounded like a nice guy
on the surface and I don't know if he was set up I don't know what happened but the
fact that he's killed and there's no witnesses and I looked up this lodge hundreds of people
are there at any one time very suspicious that nobody saw it on a Saturday at three
thirty in the afternoon yeah a lot of stuff and then you find the classic PTSD Marine
at his house and I guess he'll come out and say he did it I mean we know the government
got the underwear bomber on the plane that came out in Congress we know they order to
stand down on seven seven we know they ran drills of the exact same trains being bombed
at the exact same time and exact same locations so again they have a history of this yes you're
not wrong to say they could have staged it because if they staged other mass shootings
Operation Northwoods describes how to do it and how to even blame patsies just type in
Operation Northwoods you'll be at the Library of Congress and you can read a what twelve
page declassified memorandum green-lighted by LL M and sir chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff
to JFK's desk who vetoed it and then Bobby came back this has since been declassified
it's even on frontline on PBS I've read this it was declassified about 15 years ago but
it came out a few years ago mainstream news you can look it up Bobby Kennedy wanted to
run a false flag against Nicaragua also they talked about bombing the Honduran Embassy
and blaming it on the Honduran government don't believe me just type RFK wanted to run
false flag against Honduras and Nicaragua look it up so yeah they do this stuff they're
the people that do this out of thousands of graduate seals the last decade thousands and
thousands it happens to this guy come on and seal team six the helicopter with 23 of them
which they never put and said they were suspicious the mission was weird they weren't told where
they were going they always basically are there was no planning this came out they were
told get on the helicopter and we were told more evidence they were killed they went to
save Army Rangers pinned down turned out that wasn't true see when they have a PR thing
like yeah Pat Tillman was charging up an al-qaeda hill taking out al-qaeda turns out they murdered
him but private Lynch was charged into the enemy territory at the convoy turned out she
was cowering in fear rest of her unit fought the Iraqis the unit started speaking outs they
killed four of them in one week car accidents shot in the back of the head one guy was barbecuing
in Phoenix and a guy pops up in a black head to toe black uniform double taps him in the
head at about 30 yards away and disappears and the police are like oh it's no big deal
you know guy just pops up in a ninja outfit double taps you in the head that's not a government
sniper or anything that's just exact training precision kill and private Lynch she went
public I said you better go public or you're dead I don't know if she got the warning she
came out three days later after those four people got killed in her unit that were speaking
out she said it's all fake Pentagon told me to lie Jerry Bruckheimer was producing it
Jerry Bruckheimer was scripting and telling him what to say and what to do when they did
the fake raid on the hospital he was on a sat connection video sat telling the commander
what to do on that raid how to stage it as she hid underneath the gurney three days after
the Iraqi Republican Guard had pulled out three days after the doctors had come and
said hey this area is open come she's here they sent people found it was true pulled
back Jerry Bruckheimer directed the whole thing that's on record BBC even admitted it
now there's the BBC admitting and they just meant as a footnote oh by the way it was directed
by Jerry Bruckheimer directed by the director of Black Hawk Down now you think things might
be fake I don't know caller go ahead and finish your point we only got a minute it's just
and that's only the tip of the iceberg go ahead Alex it's just like you said you know
then then the police found him at his home and they had footage of the cops by Holmes
all in a row with the police car they were at the tape around it so which was he was
he on the highway or was he caught at his home and all these inconsistent well you're
always gonna get inconsistencies but but when it follows the pattern who this guy is
come on folks if we don't think if we don't investigate that this was a setup we're chumps
it might have been real what one chance out of ten what's your gut tell you what's your
gut tell you on this my gut tells me they whacked him my gut tells me it's all staged
they're gonna blame some mental patient and blame the Second Amendment and they're now

globalist it's understanding that we don't have a choice and it's exhilarating to stand
up against tyranny don't let it crush you down don't make it let you feel like you don't
have any power you've got incredible power that's why they're scared of you and ninety-nine
percent of the people that serve evil are compartmentalized and don't even know it sometimes
it's easier to wake up somebody who actually works on the inside than the outside because
they know it's true police are the easiest to wake up because they listen and they know
man this guy knows what he's talking about how does he know all this this is what I've
done for 17 years I know what you're going to be told before you get told it I know all
the training the programs the brainwashing all of it okay military people this show is
incredibly popular with the military unbelievably so it blows me away anytime I walk into a
restaurant there's troops almost every time they come over in our listeners and I and
they tell me how their whole unit listens and all bass listens and how I'm banned and
how they tell them don't listen so everybody starts listening that's been going on for
like 15 years I'm gonna go to our guests and then your calls I'm gonna go to Brendan and
Donna and Eric and Eric and Derek we're gonna get to all of you our guest is just on for
10 minutes with us the point is is that we've got a chance to really hurt the globalist
and by the grace of God and your prayers I'm still alive and because there's a lot of good
people in the system as well who've been compartmentalized we've got to get those compartmentalization
membranes those bulkheads out of there so people can see for miles and miles not just
what's right in front of them what's being shoved in front of them you got blinders on
and they just shove under the tiny little blinder what you're allowed to see we need
to get people seeing all around them we need to believe in humanity again God's creations
we need to know God made us in his image to be leaders and builders not to be slaves of
the devil in this system all right now that said we're gonna go to our guest I interviewed
him a few months ago people really asked us to have him back so he is back the fix is
in the showbiz manipulation of the NFL Major League Baseball NBA NHL and NASCAR and more
and when I asked him what's the most corrupt is it boxing he said no not really it's probably
basketball and again it is getting more and more corrupt because it is the new religion
and people say don't touch my religion it is just unbelievable and we saw the power
go off last night and you know they're saying this moment of electrifying football comedy
brought to you by the greenest game in Super Bowl history and they're getting you used
to it well green energy goes off but it's for the earth and they have global earth day
and earth hour and all these other days turn your power off they've had other sporting
events where they turn it off on purpose Enron got caught turning power off to condition
people that there's not enough power so everyone will accept higher power prices all over the
country power prices are going up and all over the world they precipitate power prices
going up by turning the power off on purpose to create the perception of scarcity it is
a mass hoax and I believe from knowing what I know and I covered it last hour that this
was probably staged I don't know Brian Toohey's take on this but we're going to get his take
he's the author of the fixes in the showbiz manipulators of sports recognizes America's
leading expert on game fixing and sports he's been interviewed by everything XM ESPN you
name it this show Coast to Coast AM with George Norie you name it and he joins us and of course
sports is used to have little kids from Sandy Hook to demonize the Second Amendment exploit
them and to have ads running against the Second Amendment it's like the running man in the
Stephen King novel the running man that got turned into a movie the short story that's
what it is sports has always been the heart of the Nazi regime the heart of the Soviet
regime the heart of the Roman regime the heart of society's manipulating people it's the
big grand pageant so the globalists the controllers can inject their propaganda I'm not even saying
sport if you're in sports they're great I think sports are the best thing for children
I think they're one of the few wholesome things left but at the top it's rotten at the top
it's disgusting at the at the top it's Lance Armstrong it's a dirty joke well the Bible
says wickedness is in high places so of the book the fixes in available discounted at
info or shop calm support the author support us get the truth out he joins us now what
was your take overall first on the Super Bowl and then the blackout did you see any any
signs there you know one team's winning and then the blackout happens and then the momentum
changes to me that's not where the real fixes would be but you're the expert Brian good
to have you it's good to be on again Alex good to hear from you with the Super Bowl
before we get into that quick I don't know did you happen to see the sports page of the
New York Times today at all no I didn't okay there's a big thing in soccer which is the
world's game literally the world's game most popular game in the world they had a big announcement
regarding over probably 600 different soccer matches that have been fixed worldwide recently
and they think it's all pinpointed perhaps to one guy in Singapore and I mean these are
literally soccer matches that every letter full all the way up to the World Cup which
is even bigger than the Super Bowl and so I hear from a lot of people say well you know
you can't fix the game well here's a little proof that games have been fixed literally
worldwide literally in the biggest sport and the biggest stage out there and yet people
think you know nobody can mess with the Super Bowl and I just find that absurd because you
look at what happened last night and you've seen that the referees made calls that should
have not been made it there calls that they overlooked that should have been made and
then you had this whole blackout which you know literally has everybody in the country
talking about the Super Bowl whether you want to or not and we did find that article we'll
put it back up on screen for TV viewers over at mfallwarsnews.com investigation finds suspected
fixing in 680 soccer matches and scanning over that while you were talking I noticed
that it's exactly what you wrote in your book how they're doing it because you've read the
FBI files.
Well exactly I mean I know that I know that games in the NFL have been fixed I know games
in the NBA have been fixed in Major League Baseball and I know that they're still investigating
potential fixed games today the problem is you don't hear about it because they don't
want you to hear about it because they don't want you to think that something like this
could be corrupted because they want to distract you and they want to entertain you and they
don't want you to think about this sort of corruption within the game but it's true that
it has to be there I mean the NFL says we've never had a game fixed by anyone ever and
I've talked to numerous guys in sports books on both sides of the you know both sides of
the window guys who booked the bets guys who are making the bets and they'll say to a man
that that's absurd that of course games have been fixed but you can't prove these things
because you can't find the proof you can't find the evidence because there is no concrete
evidence of this sort of behavior so this is a big deal last night and you see that
game you know it's very likely that last night's game was manipulated to keep it interesting
to the very end to literally the last play of the game because it made CBS happy that
made the advertisers happy and it made the NFL happy go over the numbers on sports betting
just in the United States well sports betting there's no been no good estimate because it's
all illegal I mean literally only perhaps as much as one percent of the amount of money
gambled on sporting events the United States has done legally in Las Vegas and Nevada otherwise
they estimate anywhere from 80 to 380 billion dollars is wagered illegally on this country
on sporting events each year which even if you take the low estimate the 80 billion dollars
it's nearly four times as much money as the NFL, NBA, Major League Baseball and the National
Hockey League combined.
It's amazing numbers we're talking about here did you see any signs overtly of manipulation
last night I mean I guess you're saying you did break down how they do that well the main
thing the legal way and it's the scary part is it is legal for like if the NFL wanted
to fix its own game if they wanted to fix the Super Bowl last night or manipulate it
they can do so legally because there's no law that prevents them from doing that and
the easiest way to do it would be through the referees now last night they had this
referee named Boger who was admittedly probably one of the middle ranked of their own officiating
crew and yet he wanted to officiate in the biggest game of the year which is not the
way the NFL is supposed to do it but a lot of people think because he was African American
that he got put on this main stage just because of that and now you have this guy on this
big stage and then you see clearly like especially late in the game calls that should have been
made penalties that should have been called on the Ravens that weren't called that weren't
assessed and you had guys like Phil Simms on CBS broadcast at first saying oh that was
a good no call and then as the game progressed he said well maybe they should have made that
call but I guess they're just letting them play out there well apparently if you have
a rule book in the NFL it doesn't always apply you can apply the rules when you want to and
obviously obviously he's been told to do this if it is fixed and so he's not going to get
in trouble and that's why you see these obvious calls that are meant to keep the game close
or longer exactly and that benefits everybody involved everybody is making more money because
of that because you know when's the last time we had a Super Bowl that wasn't really interesting
there was a blow-off it's been over a decade since that happened and I just don't I don't
believe in coincidence when billions of dollars are at stake and notice they say that this
was the highest rated and made the most money ever well and the scary part is I mean how
many people voted in the last presidential election like 126 million I think give or
take and that's probably pretty much the same amount of people in the United States who
watch a Super Bowl last night does that say something about our country and in not necessarily
the best of ways that we're more interested in a football game than perhaps who is in
control of our government
it is the modern bread and circus the opiate of the masses now what about the power outage
that's like the clue game or everybody's at the castle and the lights go off and somebody's
got a steak knife stuck in their chest and then the rest of the you know movie you're
trying to find out who did it and then oh it's green energy we've got to get used to
the power going off I've seen them turn the power off for a few minutes to show that energy
is bad at soccer games in Europe and things I think it was staged I think they did this
on purpose to keep the game going to make everybody hyped them their awareness to have
something different go on what do you think I agree with you I don't think it was necessarily
legit but in fact that it was really truly just somebody screwed up somewhere I mean
I've heard real people say that the NFL did it on purpose like you say to make it more
interesting to get people talking about the game I've heard people say that city New Orleans
did it basically as revenge against the NFL because of the bounty skate bounty gate scandal
within the NFL that really punished the New Orleans Saints I've heard a lot of different
things and nobody it's amazing that nobody even from the city of New Orleans from the
power company there has said publicly what happened well you would think by now they
would have been pretty easy to figure it out because they got the lights back on within
30 minutes so it couldn't have been that big of a deal well here's the issue here's the
issue they turn the lights on all the time they know what they're doing and it just shows
the arrogance of the system that things like this happen but hey people don't just believe
now the official story they're told anymore that it was just a snafu that shows the power
structure is losing all its credibility where do you see this going for sports just bigger
and bigger and maybe you know the games get even more tight and it gets more obvious but
people don't care because the ticket says it's only entertainment well that's the main
thing it is only entertainment it is just show business but i think at a certain point
in time these things at least the united states has to reach a saturation level where it can't
get much bigger unless they put on more and more of a production where it becomes more
than sport which is fine where but where it becomes like you say show business where it's
not fine and where people start seeing through it i mean you know you only watch so much
reality tv before you realize well you know this isn't all real you know they're staging
some of this they're making these things occur because they have to keep the show interesting
well that's exactly what i think they do with sports that they stage certain things they
promote certain teams they promote certain players and make sure those teams and players
succeed because they think it makes it a better production it makes people well they're also
blurring the lines between reality and fiction where the zero dark 30 they have the white
house and the senate come out and say hardly any of this is accurate this is all wrong
but it's the original fake story the white house put out but then they put a disclaimer
oh this is inaccurate but people go and i've sat there in restaurants repeatedly because
i've gone to a restaurant twice right by a movie theater and i heard people talk about
oh it's a true story it's so incredible we just saw zero dark 30 and the thing is literally
a work of fiction yeah and that's why i think you know your sporting events are going the
same way do one more segment with us i want to ask what else is on the radar screen and
what this big soccer report absolutely validating what you've been saying means to this this

you know i gotta be honest with you i only talked to chris kyle once for about 45 minutes
or so i guess i liked him i mean he came off like a real guy i guess he's from dallas like
i am or outside dallas like i am and i but i know jesse ventura never talks about wanting
troops to die and i've actually seen him tear up before all this happened talking and driving
in my car talking about troops being killed because he really loves the military all these
guys do did and that's ventura first said i think his gut was right he goes do you think
they had a double as a setup to set him up that's the first thing jesse ventura said
last year when i called him and he had to go into town to send an email to get on the
phone with me and he's like alex he had his wife there and he had it on speaker i guess
in a hotel room or whatever he's like alex ah you know you're joking this isn't real
lee come on and so i know ventura didn't do this and i just don't know what they did to
chris kyle but i think they killed him i mean just i was here reading this new article that
just went up at info wars.com just went up murdered navy seal was obama gun control foe
and i've actually seen this video this weekend where he was he was working and going to a
national campaign to get armed teachers and they just do not want somebody out there who's
got that type of credibility just like pat tillman was going to come home and bad mouth
the opium and stuff and they killed him murdered navy seal chris kyle gunned down at point
blank range in texas this past weekend was emerging as a prominent gun control critic
working to place armed guards in schools in the aftermath of the sandy hook massacre very
important article by paul watson and i it's not just that he's dead i mean i i i've said
bad things about him like you know he talks about lying in his book he talks about lying
for operations or whatever um it's not good to talk ill of the dead especially if you
don't know they were a bad person i just am just really really upset right now by the
way a lot of prominent pro-gun people are being killed and if this continues we know
there's a purge and atf is visiting gun owners that buy just one gun two guns buy ammo they're
harassing people uh homeland security says we're the new terrorist and man this is this
is bad this is bad they say returning vets are the number one enemy and obama's got an
nda we're going to come back the next hour go directly to brenda and others that are
holding the fix is in brown we got about three minutes how big is this soccer situation where
it's now coming out okay lance armstrong did dope okay yeah the soccer games are fixed
uh i mean this is this is a big deal if this ever starts coming out will it hurt things
or will it just be like going to disney world to watch a football game you know it's fake
but you know that uh sky mountain or whatever still is pretty fun i think you look at professional
wrestling and you can see that where people don't necessarily care that it's fake but
it's still a good entertainment it's still you know good show of physical prowess on
these people apart but you look at soccer like you say the thing that worries me the
thing that scares me it should scare a lot of sports fans in this country is if you can
look around the world and you can see as many games have been fixed apparently in soccer
there's i think 680 they mentioned that article alone and that's not covering everything that's
just one investigation i mean you look at tennis has been fixed you look at cricket
that's been fixed rugby games have been fixed but then you look here in the united states
and supposedly everything's fine you know nothing no football no baseball no basketball
no hockey well we're a free country i mean come on nothing the government private corporations
i mean jaeger hoover said the mafia was a conspiracy theory in 1952 well exactly and
that's that's the part that should be frightening sports fans because you can't look at these
games and say they can't be fixed not when there's that much money being illegally gambled
out there that money has the power to corrupt because it's all going to organize crime they're

mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's alex jones
on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones we did a special report
the nightly news on friday titled taylor swift dirty little secret the eight-minute video
has since begun to go viral a raw story actually did a fair report on aspartame admitting that
studies show it's bad for you alex jones taylor swift loves genetically modified bacteria
poop gotta love that headline and people say well beer all that you know that's yeast let's
plants putting it off not e.coli bacteria that are fed different substances that then
poop it out like to talk about poop all day but anything to keep people from getting big
fat brain tumors from aspartame let's go to brenda in wisconsin thanks for holding you're
on the air welcome brenda brenda actually brenda alex thanks uh you know i i stopped
watching uh grown adults watched their chase balls around on fields years ago when i became
much more of an infowars uh listener and fan and i thank you for that um uh but i did tune
in last night with my girlfriend who um knows that many of the things that uh info warriors
talk about are true but doesn't always want to deal with the uh thought process so i said
hey look we gotta watch the halftime show i know it's gonna be schlocky but i really
want to see based off of last year's show how many overt illuminati signs there would
be and so it's going on you know as it progressed not many um light show pyramids and eyeballs
and stuff but then you see all these people in the crowd sticking their hands up there
the tallest people in the crowd i'm sure planted there and they're doing their pyramid you
know hand signs i said and i i told her about that ahead of time and uh she said no you're
just making you know it's funny you say that because again i dropped by a party for about
an hour last night at a restaurant that shut down for the super bowl and so i went to a
crew party that i was invited to uh over at that restaurant nice restaurant the point
is putting a plug for steiner steakhouse and i'm over there with shane steiner and i'm
sitting there and one of the only times i was watching i looked up and i see the crowd
them showing people doing illuminati signs and my critics will now take that as a still
and say i'm doing that uh but sure enough you just called in about it and i'm so conditioned
i got in today and i'm not even telling my crew hey go get the halftime show show people
this that's how they get you it's like now it's an open secret they had weirdos standing
up everywhere and then beyonce show a document cam shot of this if you can she does the illuminati
symbol tell folks what you saw because i barely watched and caught some of that and i'm like
really did i just see that tell folks what you saw and i and i have more points on that
as well because you know tell me what you saw tell me what you saw i definitely i definitely
saw the tallest people in the crowd with gold you'll see this year the whole theme is gold
and black every award show everything going on in the gold bracelet doing clear pyramid
hand signs right in the camera shot the tallest people there are in those hands are the ones
that are lit up by the lights not only that i said she said well i want to see don't and
abby if the power's out and i said it doesn't matter turn back turn back to the super bowl
after 33 minutes oh my gosh it was a ritual they turned the light off and of course it
always has multiple uses just coming too fast now and then they're the thousand points of
light that's the highest illuminati type operation scallom bones george bush senior talks about
it and so they have a thousand people stand up and do the illuminati sign when the lights
off saying we're going to bring the light back yeah and the play-by-play guy at 27 minutes
if anyone who's t-bowed this i haven't gone back to it one of the guys says he trips himself
up and he says we're now in the 27th minute of power outage and blah blah and my girlfriend
said well can i flip it down to abby i said sure you know give five more minutes we got
to go back to it that's when it'll be back on and she thinks that i'm full of baloney
and uh and sure enough that's what happened but at the 27th minute when i checked the
guy trips himself up and he starts to say we're now 27 minutes into it and then he starts
to say 30 blah blah blah and he cuts himself off stay there oh my gosh they believe they
get power off these the olympics is a ritual alex jones here with a message to fellow freedom

hitler admitted that the modern olympics that germany first launched in the thirties hitler
drew the rings together that was going to be the original nazi symbol was the rings
the colored rings and they admitted that that was a ritual of nordic power now always going
back to the greeks the romans but the aztecs sports was highly ritualized and religious
the druids had games and the loser was killed but the aztecs a lot of times the winners
got killed in the ball playing court i visited at chichen itza amazing to see the different
images of the winners faces carved in the stone the skulls with flesh rotting off their
faces carved on the in the stone incredibly powerful in fact i'll google that and show
some of the tv viewers or just type in chichen itza skulls ball playing court skulls but
but side issues see when i get up here and say it's illuminati here is yahoo sports did
beyonce flash illuminati sign what did the super dome power go out your super bowl mystery
solve and they make fun of anybody that questions it imagine last year you've got madonna on
giant gold and black pyramids doing all sorts of illuminati hand signs with all sorts of
demonic stuff everywhere all highly babylon mystery religion egyptian mystery religion
that's where the illuminati comes from in your face she is the goddess in fact she's
the goddess if you put it into greek eulogia that they worship at skull and bones and skull
and bones have been broken into before that's been confirmed we got their internal documents
via anthony sutton who got them from charlotte iserby but the point is is that she oh yeah
there's the ball playing court people that thought i was kidding if you're watching on
tv imagine the magnitude of this that at 33 minutes in right after she's done doing an
illuminati high sign right after they're done doing that do the exact science she did it
was that okay again of your radio listener it's the top was the top story on yahoo they've
pulled it but we're gonna do a special report on this tonight and they throw all this in
your face and guess what the illuminati high holy number is it's 33 because it in the sun
rooms in the egyptian temples where they worship the sun 33.3 dials in to the sun calculations
of six six six will you guys print me my article on that that we did we did an article whose
article is that and i'll plug the source of it because that that was some key intel you
had there we were just showing viewers all the illuminati signs that madonna did illuminati
supermole halftime show symbolism explained madonna go ahead and scroll down yeah we need
to get we had a video report last year on this we need to get that get it together with
the crew and have it out tonight print me that please see and see i can't work all the
time i feel guilty even when i take off for 10 minutes to play with my children and last
night i'm driving home at about seven and my buddy calls me goes hey we're having a
private party over at the restaurant why don't you come over and you know have a beer or
something and and and barbecue so i pull in there i go in halftime goes on a little later
and i'm looking up and there's a power outage and i look up and i see people standing up
doing illuminati signs and i just looked down and i just said man this world's getting too
weird how it's all just out in the open and then they say oh you didn't see anything see
it's out in the open but it's meant to hit the subconscious public who's on awake when
we're awake and we go hey hey look illuminati ritual it goes dark for 33 minutes we looked
it up 33 minutes 55 seconds just shy of 34 minutes and she does bathomet squatting all
of this god help us god help us god help us i mean they are doing giant babylonian satanic
egyptian rituals in front of everyone and it is just so completely out of control that
we've come down to this and see the caller calls in if you didn't hear it i'm going to
go back to him to recap everything he said then i'll go to others because we've got to
hurry against the rest of the callers before lord montan pops in and i'm i wasn't even
going to cover this i came in this morning okay they did the illuminati symbols they
tell all the hip-hop people do that to sell it is cool just like they told you know hulk
hogan have a group called the new world order after bush started talking about it bush senior
then people go oh you're talking about the new world order they've got to acclimate you
that it's non-threatening and a joke and then yahoo's like people claim there's something
called the illuminati it's a historical fact it's just one branch of illusiferian order
who publicly it's mainline history founded skull and bones the illuminati founded skull
and bones in 1832 it's chapter 322 which means the uncompleted because it's below the 33rd
32 degree you know that's masonic yes the general masons have not been satanic themselves
but an ancient construction guild with hidden knowledge but it predates judaism and christianity
so it is a cultic it was christianized you didn't just get into a university and learn
mathematics that was valuable so it got guarded by an intelligence agency you call it a secret
society because if you just indict masons you drive them away from the truth to being
honest about the fact that there's a war inside of the system with the illuminati trying to
take it over this is so disgusting see the most evil people know that really good truly
enlightened real illuminated people that just means awoken by god's light are going to
stand up for human liberty try to build it up so the evil comes in and says oh we're
good too we want to empower humanity join our order it's the real it's above the 33rd
degree you see and they're just doing giant rituals just
like david ike said i mean they do these giant rituals they admit their rituals at the big
events out there like the olympics and now they have a 33 minute darkness with with weirdos
standing up in the crowd doing the hand sign magnifying with her up on the stage who did
the hand sign during the darkness during the 33 minutes i mean this was a stinking ritual
and the media is going to pick this up and call me crazy because they know they don't
want you to know they want to initiate your subconscious so you're in their cult but never
consciously new they don't want you to have free will they america is under a dark spell
we are under witchcraft folks this is real they've proven it it's scientific the ancients
just called it witchcraft we've been mesmerized hypnotized put into this and it's right there
they're all big on top big pyramids flashing illuminati signs with the lights going out
and i'm the conspiracy theorist there it is there it is what is this like five super bowls
in a row they've done this janet jackson's breast pops out oh she goes oops and there's
a sun sign and all the rest of this garbage they've got to do it they want your attention
they are doing rituals because they believe they're affecting you know whether you believe
in god or not believe in the spiritual world they teach you it's smart to not believe in
the spiritual world because you can't see it well this this this domain this five senses
third dimension is is only one it's been proven mathematically what all the ancients said
there are all these other layers above us all this full spectrum it's there and whether
it's real or not whether there's things inhabiting that or not intelligences the elites believe
it's giving them power they believe they are in contact with entities across the void they
believe they've got power from it so they are in power whether they believe they got
the power from it and just had confidence from it or whether they really are getting
the power from it you cannot debate the fact they are worshipping devilish entities and
look at what the elite does look at how they're trying to wreck the family how they're trying
to wreck liberty how they're trying to bring in tyranny how they're doing all of this they're
doing all of this in your face and see i'm so sick of it and i was watching this when
i was calm last night i was put under a little bit of a trance i wasn't even going to come
in and cover it until the caller called in and shifted me back into being aware you see
how dangerous it is to watch stuff like that wow what an epiphany i just had brendan in
wisconsin you only got about a minute and a half recap your points and then finish the
other ones okay i'm i'm gonna recap that yeah you see the illuminati hand signs but the
triangles from the crowd it's of the people right and the and the and the spotlights are
only hitting those really tall hands right in the front that's one point 33 minutes the
nfl or cbs was saying 34 minutes no no i looked it up this morning it was 33 minutes usa today
i'll be 33.55 now we timed it now specifically because we're gonna go pull it up i saw it
when were they holding the hands up in the illuminati ritual not not her when when were
the plants doing it what time was that uh that was that was right during the halftime
show which i really can't stand to watch nor could i last year but you have awakened me
and other people have awakened me so now i force myself to watch that garbage um there
are a few other key points that the the power went out with 13 22 3 2 2 13 22 on the clock
i don't know if that's significant 3 2 2 now it's all significant it's all staged and i
have a couple more points if you have time go start making them okay and also psyops
always occur every time there's focused attention around the world and i talked to uh professor
griff in my establishment i invited him to town and he told me all about the illuminati
in the music yeah no i want to get professor griff on and he plugs my films but we need
to know how to get in contact with him hold on stay there introducing pro one all of your

uh let's talk to derek in texas derek you're on the air welcome alex thank you it's an
honor to speak to you 13 year listener first time caller god bless i'll call it i'm calling
this find out your opinion about piers morgan coming here to tactical firearms in katie
texas he's coming here to report tonight apparently about uh he's gonna be shooting a gun there
and i heard that the owner of the tactical firearms was once deported an ammunition van
say that again the owner of tactical fire no start over at the beginning usually they're
not telling me stuff and it's not their fault they're supposed to talk to me they're telling
me lord monkton was there and i missed the first part of what she said start over i'm
sorry piers morgan is supposed to be reporting at tactical firearms in katie texas tonight
he's supposed he's supposed to be shooting a gun talking about um background checks mental
health and uh i think it's interesting because the owner of tactical firearms has once been
on the radio supporting an ammunition ban i didn't know that slime morgan was going
to be here because again he doesn't have a big audience sometimes the stuff on his show
gets played on other shows so it only has a big audience when what he does is a derivative
and then he gets a tiny amount of actual viewers to his show from that he has biggest shows
like half a million when i was on like a million and 800,000 the next day and then it went
down from there uh but katie texas uh he's gonna be uh he's gonna be there himself shooting
so that's that's the room the rumor had it that he was coming to a gun gun shop in texas
and then uh he proved it on his twitter account two days ago he is coming to tactical firearms
and uh it's happening right down the street from me i was just curious if anybody from
your crew is going to be there reporting or if i should go try to get some photos or what
i haven't gotten any response from tactical firearms themselves i don't really know uh
the full details but um i was shocked to hear it and uh i just i just hope someone in your
crew is covering it well katie's katie's pretty close to texas no no he's saying the guy put
a twitter out he's saying go to piers morgan's twitter guys that's how you confirm it um
so piers morgan you're saying put it out on twitter yes piers piers morgan is coming to
houston let's put that back up on screen for viewers tactical firearms is very very proud
of that and he's going to a facility where they support restricting our second amendment
isn't that just classic yeah are you have you been aware of the of that owner um you
know uh being supportive of all this gun control legislation and whatnot and then no i wasn't
aware of that but you know what they're gonna do they're gonna come down here and go i'm
here in the heart of the crazy texans but even these texans want to turn their guns
in i don't dislike texans sure i'm a red coat while your ancestors trounced the filthy king
i worship i mean just unbelievable i felt exactly the same way when i woke up i was
furious i couldn't believe that well listen everybody should go you know it's a private
facility so it's private property but everybody should go and be part of it and try to be
interviewed by cnn and i think people ought to be across the street from it it's a free
country bullhorning piers morgan and protesting his butt i don't know if i've got time to
get in the car and get down there i mean how far away is katie from austin it's only about
an hour and 45 minutes on a good drive from you um i was just shocked yeah why are they
saying houston cnn doesn't even know when i heard katie and then the news said houston
i'm like katie's not houston well exactly i actually live right in right where he where
it's going to be and katie it's zoned in uh in houston like we're technically houston
but i have to put katie in all my addresses so it's it's in uh harris county oh that's
why it seems like it's closer to austin it's out west of there towards austin and houston
so huge that once you're uh outside there wow that's about two hours away isn't it yeah
it's a lot closer to you than than uh downtown houston i guess technically they could then
say houston because houston's a mega giant punch it back up folks tactical firearms everybody
needs to get over there and get in his face you know and he likes to spin it like it's
an anti-british thing that we're saying go home they don't want him over there the british
folks are great people but we've got one of them coming up on the other side of this break

basic rights that came out of the magna carta and common law we'll be back we're on the

territory piers morgan pushing the disarmament of the american people uh and i guess they
found some gunshot shop let's let's punch them back up for tv viewers um that uh is

public policy christopher monkton and brenchley joins us and he is over in australia to see
what agenda 21 is really like agenda 21 fascism's new face they're a few years ahead of us in
australia under the climate tyranny and he joins us to break it down lord monkton thank
you for coming on with us alex it's a real pleasure to be with you and congratulations
on your wonderful interview with piers morgan on gun control i wonder how many tens of millions
have seen it now uh it is tens of millions airing on every tv station out there and also
tens of millions online but but you know i actually was under the weather that day and
blew up at him but i'm glad i did because it got people out of their coma we need to
get aggressive with these people and he tried to spin it that i'm being anti-uk i'm actually
pro-uk in england i want you to be a sovereign country not under eu domination my ancestors
uh... come from uh... wales in england and scotland ireland piers morgan's tried to
spin it though and so so is the british press that i'm i'm being anti anti-british i'm anti
being disarmed it's not british to have your weapons taken in fact you guys always had
the right to keep mere arms until it was taken by the collectivist you want to briefly speak
to that well certainly i mean we we had a shooting incident like the one that has provoked
the latest round of demands for gun control in the u s this was a done blaine in scotland
and unfortunately it happened during a socialist government and of course whenever the socialists
get the chance to tighten up on legislation they will and so there was a knee-jerk reaction
in parliament and a law was passed to take away our hand guns which were almost entirely
held in private collections and were shot privately on ranges under supervision it was
all very well control as you can imagine in the uk and anyway all of that was swept away
but the result was the interesting thing crime involving hand guns went up by forty percent
the moment they took our hand guns away because once you drive the ownership of guns underground
then all you do is you criminalize it and that increases the use of guns in crime it
does not reduce it it certainly does now you talk about that the the the new face of fascism
agenda 21 people are starting to wake up to it but you've traveled australia that's been
captured uh by this even though the people are awake and don't like it in polls i've
seen it doesn't matter what government they put in it just continues break down how draconian
it is in a country what four five years ahead of uh other nations well that's right see
the european dictatorship and the dictatorship of julia gillard the communist from wales
who runs australia at the moment and is at the moment herself facing an extremely serious
criminal investigation which is getting very very close to her and that's one of the reasons
why she's announced the um election uh that they're about to have and she's announced
it seven months before is going to be held the other reason why she's announced an earlier
question incidentally is that kevin rudd the man whom she displaced with an internal coup
in the labor party is the kind of thing that communists do to each other all the time uh
she had heard that next month he was going to mount a leadership challenge to get back
the premiership from her and that he had the numbers to do it she's become very unpopular
even within her own party and of course she's uh even more unpopular i think than obama
uh with her opponents here and so she heard he was mounting this challenge and that he'd
got the numbers in the parliamentary labor party to to to win and so what she did was
to announce the date of the election very hastily because then if he were to announce
a leadership challenge it would seem to the party like downright disloyalty not just to
her but to the party as a whole and then he wouldn't have the numbers so it was a master
stroke on her part and of course she can also take advantage of the fact that during the
campaigning which has effectively already begun she can do all of her campaigning on
the government's dime while the opposition can't so she's hoping to gain advantage from
it but she is getting very close to having her collar felt in a criminal investigation
i can't give more details over the air but it's certainly something which i'm not sure
she'll even last out until september because they are getting that close to her now but
in the meantime she and her government introduced what is called a carbon tax they were originally
going to charge larger companies and fossil fuel companies and big manufacturers and farmers
and miners and fishermen they were going to charge them 23 dollars for every ton of carbon
dioxide they emitted as part of the their electricity use it was going to be enormously
cripplingly expensive it was going to shut down the economy of australia unfortunately
uh the opposition here led by tony abbott who is a very thoughtful quiet and extremely
determined man managed to divert her away from doing that and in the end she cut and
ran and said no we can't charge 23 dollars a ton when the rest of the world is only paying
or at least the eu which is the only other place that's really got a carbon tax is only
paying at the moment kind of two or three dollars a ton and so she decided to link the
carbon tax here with the european trading scheme so that the same price is charged for
carbon dioxide here as in europe and of course she will go on the television and say that
what she's demonstrating is leadership in doing this but the rest of the world is conspicuously
not following even of course obama's united states is not going to have the cab and text
and of course if you go further north to canada where stephen harper now has as a conservative
an overall majority as prime minister a rare thing in their electoral system he is shutting
down all this environmental nonsense all these creepy agencies that are going around trying
to close down the the economies of the west while here in australia of course these agencies
are rampant i'm speaking to you at the moment from the summit of mount lofty in australia
just in south australia around the back of adelaide it's the most beautiful country
around here but of course this is the middle of their summer so it's fairly dry and they
all have all the farmers up here i'm staying with one of them they all keep small dams
that they've built to retain a bit of water to make sure that their stock and their crops
can be watered when the rains don't come which they don't come for six months of the year
and sometimes for seven years at a time and what is happening is that in has come the
natural resources management board of south australia one of the most hated bureaucracies
on earth and it's going around interfering with people's right to take water from the
dams that they and their ancestors have built as a result farms are closing at so large
a rate but since the 1970s something like a hundred thousand farmers in australia have
already gone out of business not because they can't make money in farming because they're
pretty good at it out here it's it's the biggest industry in australia no it's because they're
being pestered by so many bureaucrats just down the road from where i'm speaking a few
years ago there was a guy extracting the water from his his dam or in fact it was from a
neighbor's dam but he had permission to do it so that he could water his stock and there
were snoopers this is how they do it snoopers have been hiding for weeks behind a hedge
on a hill nearby watching him through binoculars they didn't realize that he was supplying
this water to his stock and they eventually did a raid at 11 o'clock at night while he
was working on one of the pumps that wasn't functioning they punched on him they drove
their utility vehicle at him which had a rhubarb on the front they hit him with that and he
still has pain from that to this day six years later and then they left him for dead and
the next thing they did realizing they'd done wrong was to go and report that he had done
to them what they had done to him so when he went a week later to the two weeks later
to the police station after he got out of hospital to say that he'd been attacked in
this way he was immediately arrested on the ground quite specious that he had attacked
them that's what's going on here i am now investigating this case and i'm about to do
an amicus curiae brief to the court that eventually convicted him of illegally taking water from
that creek because the conviction was wrong i've already established that he had taken
none of the water they said he'd taken for any purpose other than supplying his stock
which he had written permission from the government to do well what's incredible is they're harassing
everybody i mean i see the australian it's alex because uh... what we're going to do
is it looks to me at the moment and i've got to do a little bit of further investigation
it looks to me at the at the moment as though these three agents of the natural resources
management board committed attempted murder because that's what it is if you drive your
vehicle at somebody you knock them down and you leave them for dead that's attempted murder
so we're not going to be patsies out here anymore i've been talking to farmers all over
the state they're absolutely boiling furious at what's being done and if you notice now
the government that took the the semi-auto rifles now they want the bolt action in single
shot this is an authoritarian takeover they're handing the entire continent over to the communist
chinese uh... that's on record ninety nine percent of their rare earth minerals of australia
now run by state-run chinese communist operations but i see the newscast mainline tv out of
australia you've been there many times i've never been there where they show sheep farmers
who own the land and they say sorry you can't graze anymore uh... this has to be off use
for the earth your sheep's flatulence is bad for the atmosphere i mean this is a real hard
core tyranny
uh... if you want to know what it takes
there is a notorious case here that of peter spencer who actually went on hunger strike
to draw attention that's right that tied himself to a tower has been farming the land for three
generations and then in order to comply with some useless uh... obligation under the now
expired kyoto protocol the australian government arbitrarily said right we're taking away your
right to farm your land because it's been designated as a carbon sink and of course
they're doing this all over australia they're driving farmers off their own land and of
course the uh... property right in australia is protected by the constitution so what they're
craftily doing is they're just saying we're not taking away your land we're just telling
you can't actually farm it that of course renders the land worthless and therefore in
effect they have taken away your property right but they've managed to dodge and duck
and dive and unfortunately the courts here rather like in the united states are poodles
of the government that pays their lavish salaries and pensions and they will just not find against
the government when the government behaves in this way all right lord logton let me stop
you for the mineral class the three big industries are far mining and fishing all three of these
are now up in arms because the australian government and its various sinister agencies
is attacking and attacking and attacking they're trying to close australia down in the background
to this alex is agenda twenty one this u n program all forty chapters of it which was
first produced in nineteen ninety two but that ridiculous rio earth summit and the idea
of agenda twenty one is to close down the economies of the west by saying that in the
name of the environment we must reduce the population of the earth by nine tenths and
we must do that according to bill gates by vaccination he actually said it in a lecture
i've seen on the internet i i couldn't believe it until i watched it these people are completely
out of control and i've made a speech just last night in one of the farming villages
here and the people in the audience were astonished when i told them this and at first they thought
you know is monkton some kind of a flaming nutter is alex jones some kind of a nutter
no we're upset about what's happening i've got to stop you sir we're going to break we're
going to come back and have you continue lord christopher monkton is our guest ladies and
gentlemen we have confirmed from local news station that we actually have a relationship
with the big news station in houston i'm a frequent guest on there that indeed piers
morgan is there in houston he is on the outskirts of it in the little town of katie and he said
i'll be in an unnamed place three days ago we know the name of the place because they
bragged about it tactical firearms tactical firearms now we've called them and they're
denying it and you said so no way he's going to be there and they're like well we're just
not going to say but we found out local news is there am 740 ktrh did an interview with
him and we're going to post this up on infowars.com where the owner of tactical firearms said
that he believes people should be registered to get ammo registered i mean this is incredible
so it's one of these big gun shops there's a lot of these that just want to do what the
atf says they just want to operate a few more years and they'll do whatever hey you want
my guns i'll turn them in you want my guns i'll turn them in we're gonna go to break
come back with lord monkton i mean this is a anti-gun gun shop that that is groveling

so we don't cut into all the key intel that uh lord montan's giving us look they're they're
having the piers morgan event in katie texas we have a huge listenership all over texas
i don't care if you're in dallas i don't care if you're in austin i don't care if you're
in houston i don't care where you are if you're in austin you're like two hours away from
katie as half the time getting to houston is the hour end of the city it's so big it's
way out on the edge in the in the you know on the edge of town and looking at this place
it looks like it only caters to cops so they want to convert to that model or only you
know only the government uh has guns and we know and so this is has been a anti-gun gun
shop and believe me they've got them who are like hey we'll do whatever you want if it's
pop guns we can sell we'll sell those because they're just going to sell to the cops and
that's that's where he's going to be and that's where he's going now piers morgan is such
a coward that he may just freak out and go somewhere else for all i know but i'm going
i'm going and um i want to see you there to bullhorn them from across the street uh and
and invite him hey if this was so discrediting my interview with you why would you have me
back on lord monkton what do you think i should say to piers morgan if i see him again i mean
didn't he get run out of your country well i think what you should say to him is that
he should go back where he came from and not try to interfere in the internal affairs of
the united states i mean yes you know all these lefties are the same in the media they
all think that nobody should be allowed guns that the the police state should be allowed
to push everybody around and well you and i rather disagree with that alex and you know
it has been said by some that you are right on the extreme fringe well hey somebody occasionally
has to stand out a little bit from the crowd to try and warn the crowd of what's about
to hit them and there is no doubt now that the governing class worldwide is increasingly
tying itself together using the excuses such as climate change agenda went 21 environment
using gun control is something we can all unite behind this is the kind of slogan you
hear and so piers morgan is just part if you like of the establishment or the governing
class or what the french call the class politique who are increasingly remote and cut off from
ordinary people like z and me who are simply trying to get on and do a job of work and
not be interfered with by our rulers and of course the whole idea of the united states
was not to be interfered with by your rulers and unfortunately now even in the united states
your government is trying to turn itself into a tyranny the environmental protection agency
just like the south australia bureau of natural resources management is trying to take over
and interfere and effectively to legislate by the back door and to push people around
and you have these little tin pot officials in their shiny shoes and their polished suits
rushing around in government cars you know pestering farmers all over the place and the
lord monkton foundation which has been established here in australia is going as its first battle
to take these people on and say if you go around bullying farmers for instance and threatening
them that you will drive them off their land and that's one farmer i've talked already
has been threatened with that if you go around and treat them by saying that their reservoirs
are 10 million liters when they're only five million liters because if they're over 10
million you're allowed to regulate and interfere if you go around cheating like that in future
we will have you for it you will be up in either the civil or more probably the criminal
court all right let me stop you lord mountain put him put him on hold real quick now mike
adams who i really trust says he knows tactical firearms and they're great guys so this is
all moving quick and that they don't support bullet bands so maybe that's not true and
if that's the case i apologize that's not right this is all moving quick i know piers
morgan has been bragging he's going to go to a place that's pro gun control uh so again
tactical firearms may be great guys in fact i was looking at photos of them with guns
on their sides it looks pretty pretty good there thank you for listening to gcn visit

coast direct from austin you're listening to the alex jones broadcasting network network
big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's alex
jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones all right folks
things move quick and i was told and i had to print out some of the news reports that
were misconstrued that the tactical firearms was having piers morgan down because they
agreed with restricting bullets when you buy a bunch getting a background check and that
is not what they believe mike adams says he knows the owner for five years and that those
news reports are incorrect so i apologize the tactical firearms tactical firearms dot
us so that was uh incorrect the point is we know piers morgan uh is anti-gun there are
some gun shops and gun people that are so scared of the atf they are rolling over and
that's who i was talking about there but mike adams is 100 second amendment says they're
great then i'm sure they're great so people should definitely support them in the houston
area uh and i've also confirmed piers morgan piers morgan is like taping between about
three and six so i'm on my way piers soon as the show ends i'm coming i am coming to
to protest you coming here telling me i should give my guns up now if you were coming here
saying you wanted to help me have my freedom i'd say well you know join the club uh but
truly disgusting uh finishing up with lord montan sorry to cut you off there at the end
of the hour but i want to see everybody down there at tactical firearms tonight folks start
getting over there right now the next few hours other points you'd like to make lord
montan about where this attack uh worldwide is going people are starting to wake up to
agenda 21 but is it enough what do we do well i think the first thing is keep a very close
eye on every environmental law that gets passed because you'll find that what agenda 21 does
is that it works chiefly at local level what these agents of the un have done is they've
gone round to local authorities and convinced them one by one that they should implement
agenda 21 because no national government would go as far as that and there's an outfit called
ichli i c l e i and if your local authority belongs to that organization then boy are
you in trouble these are the new dictators they operate by stealth and their vice-chair
and recently said that in future the individual must subject himself to the collective and
so this is straightforward outright in your face communism dressed up as though it were
to do with the environment i call them the traffic light tendency the greens too yellow
to admit they're really reds but they're operating bureaucratically through your local authority
and you need to find out and you need to get onto your local authority representatives
your local councillors etcetera and you need to say to them but if they belong to ichli
you will vote for whichever party says that it will leave that organization and have nothing
to do with agenda 21 you have to get agenda 21 onto the agenda of local elections and
make it clear that any candidate who supported agenda 21 will not get elected by you and
once they all begin to realize that agenda 21 is hated and feared by the people as it
should be then they will uh break free and just to let you know uh one piece of rather
interesting news a map was produced by ichli of the united states which showed the places
where humans could and could not go more than half the map was covered in red where humans
were allowed to go under no circumstances at all nearly all the remainder was colored
in yellow where you could go with a permit from the socialist state if you were very
lucky and if they agreed to give you one but there were a few tiny areas most of the military
installations to keep the people in line and only a few effectively concentration camps
where all the population of america would in future have to reside and opponents of
agenda 21 took that map they got hold of it at the last minute they took that map to the
u.s senate and they showed it to senators and their staff hours before the senate was
and it shot it down we're out of time lord monses we're out of time i don't think you
can hear me over skype when i talk to you at first god bless you thank you so much for
the time sir okay all the best all right we'll talk to him again soon folks i'm going to
texas uh i'm already in texas i'm going to the piers morgan deal i confirmed inside sources
inside piers morgan is going to be there katie texas we're going to protest peacefully saddle
up texans right now the red coat is at the gate
