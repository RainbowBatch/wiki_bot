1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:20,720
he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.

3
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:47,560
Ladies and gentlemen, we are so busy, I literally just slid into the chair here. I was busy

4
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:52,560
in there in the other office watching a two-minute excerpt of the Obama phone lady from the show

5
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:57,360
yesterday. You can't go to mfullwars.com. We're rebooting the site right now, but it

6
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,640
is linked on drugsreport.com, halfway down the right-hand side.

7
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,400
Nice little excerpt of the Obama phone lady here in town with us yesterday. We need to

8
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,920
go through all the interviews that she did and kind of boil it down, because the average

9
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,240
person can't watch an hour and a half of it. I'm glad somebody on YouTube got a clip out.

10
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,360
We need to get the clips from her on the TV show last night, cuz she was so nervous in

11
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:29,120
here in studio with us yesterday. She was so incredibly nervous that she, it was kind

12
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:34,920
of subdued. But when she got on the TV show, she really talked about a lot of important

13
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,360
issues and we played the clips of Obama lying to folks.

14
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:43,360
So that certainly woke her up as an example of what we can do for others. Okay, here's

15
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:51,200
the deal. The news that we've got is so incredible that words really can't even describe how

16
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:59,720
serious our situation is right now. But I will do the best job I can when we come back

17
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:05,800
from break and I'm kind of officially kick off the broadcast today to go over all of

18
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,000
this.

19
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,960
This is so amazing when I'm looking at Joe Biden, White House eyeing 19 executive actions

20
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:24,840
on guns. Politico, CBS News, New York Assembly Speaker Silver, we are going to ban assault

21
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,040
weapons, period. And the governor said, first they make you come in and register them, then

22
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,200
they'll order them, hand it in.

23
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:39,000
And that is what the bill says. It's now passed the Senate in the New York legislature and

24
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
it's going to the full house. So we are in deep trouble, ladies and gentlemen. By decree

25
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,120
of the king, there are some steps that we can take that don't require legislation. That's

26
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,160
a video clip of Obama in his press conference yesterday.

27
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,480
Rahm Emanuel, we played this clip yesterday, says take American people out of the Second

28
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:02,680
Amendment debate. We have that that's gonna be coming up. I'm gonna play all these clips

29
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,440
coming up in the next segment.

30
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:10,360
And New York's also preparing to put gun owners in mental hospitals. I mean, you just can't

31
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:15,520
make up the magnitude of this takeover. All over the country, governors, legislatures,

32
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:20,880
they're all declaring war on the Second Amendment. New York Senate passes draconian gun bill.

33
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,480
We've got some good news though, sheriffs all over the US are going public and we have

34
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,400
one particular video we're gonna play coming up. Sheriff says teachers should be armed,

35
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,160
Second Amendment shall not be infringed.

36
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:37,440
And Aaron Dykes' video report is up on our YouTube channel and at prisonplanet.tv. That's

37
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,640
why we have those auxiliary sites so that when in full war is down, people are able

38
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:49,440
to get there. Rand Paul slams King Obama over executive order. And there's also talk in

39
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:55,920
the Congress of impeachment against Obama. In fact, guys, will you go to the search engine

40
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,920
and type in impeachment?

41
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:02,280
Cuz I saw several articles this morning that I forgot to print out or send to you. And

42
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:09,480
I wanna be able to show those news articles that there's multiple people in Congress now

43
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:14,560
talking about impeachment. And that is the only way. I mean, that should have happened

44
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,880
when Obama's get fast and furious or when they said that our military was under NATO

45
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,520
command and Congress should sit down and shut up.

46
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:28,360
GOP congressman threatens impeachment if Obama uses executive action for gun control. That

47
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:37,680
is a report there that we're gonna be going over as well today. That is just some of what

48
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:45,120
we're going to be breaking down. But this is it. This is the big enchilada. And I hope

49
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,640
that everybody realizes that this is the time to put up or shut up beside which side of

50
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,080
the republic that we are on.

51
00:04:53,080 --> 00:05:00,600
We'll be right back. Stay with us.

52
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,560
Millions of people are going to get sick this winter from colds, flu and other illnesses.

We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.

83
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:30,320
Ladies and gentlemen, these are the times that try men's souls. It's times that we all

84
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:35,680
have to have a gut check and get right with God. Everything that we have unfortunately

85
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:42,120
predicted these globalists would do is now unfolding and soon the gun confiscation will

86
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,360
be in the present.

87
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:48,960
It's in the near future right now and then soon we will be in the aftermath of whatever

88
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:54,720
comes out of this. Now, ladies and gentlemen, the corporate media in collusion with the

89
00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:02,480
politicians and their globalist owners are openly saying in the news, the president is

90
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,880
allowed to take guns by executive order.

91
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:10,880
The president is allowed to shut down gun shows by executive order. The president is

92
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:16,520
allowed to order you to turn your semi-autos in. And they are passing or are in the process

93
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:21,940
of passing outright gun confiscation in multiple states right now. We're going to be going

94
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:28,440
over all of it. Now, if you go to DrudgeReport.com, you see the big headline up there, Congressman

95
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:38,200
threatens Obama with impeachment if he tries to use executive action to restrict the Second

96
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:43,080
Amendment. And if you click on that report, it's from the Daily Caller.

97
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:48,200
We have our own reports obviously predicting this the last few months because the gun control

98
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:52,720
group said, don't worry, once he gets reelected, we're going to use executive action. People

99
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:58,240
are like, Alex, don't fear monger, that's unconstitutional, he won't do that. Texas

100
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:03,320
Republican Representative Steve Stockman, who you notice Larry Pratt has pointed out

101
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:07,840
would be our champion and had told him privately he would do this, threatened Monday afternoon

102
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,000
that he would file articles of impeachment.

103
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,280
Let's get it going, let's go, against President Barack Obama if he institutes gun control

104
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:20,640
measures with an executive order. Stockman warned that such executive orders will be

105
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,560
unconstitutional and infringe on our constitutionally protected right to keep and bear arms. And

106
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:31,880
he went on to say that I will seek to thwart this action by any means necessary, including

107
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:37,060
but not limited to, eliminating funding for implementation, defunding the White House

108
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,760
and even filing articles of impeachment.

109
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,880
Stockman said in a statement, boy, he didn't wanna get on the airplanes anytime soon, we

110
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:49,360
need more people to come out and support him now, like Rand Paul, now, not later. That

111
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,160
this is late they're doing this, this should have been done a long time ago. At his press

112
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:57,840
conference Monday, Obama floated the possibility of using executive action to enact policies

113
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,240
aimed at reducing gun violence.

114
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:04,640
He didn't float it, look, look, you see this magazine, this was published in late November.

115
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:12,040
And it says this man wants your guns, December issue of Enforce Magazine. And in the article,

116
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:20,240
go read it, we sent out an e-version of it to everybody. We have 10 predictions for 2013

117
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,760
and it's they would be coming for our guns by Mike Adams. In fact, the prediction in

118
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,560
here is that they would use executive action to do it, boom, that happened.

119
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,760
You've got the article, Obama wants your guns and the rest of your freedoms. And we go on

120
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:39,720
to say they will use executive action to get our guns. Why? Because they said they would

121
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:45,440
do that, okay? Now, here we are, and some of the more timid mainline conservatives are

122
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:50,280
like, how dare you get in a red coat's face and say, look, it's gonna cause a civil war

123
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:54,720
if you do this.

124
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,220
It's not that we want one of these civil wars, it's that they have set up Homeland Security

125
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:03,280
and put it in a posture where they say gun owners, conservatives, libertarians, returning

126
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:10,960
veterans are the enemy. And they've got the state police all over the United States training

127
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,960
for gun confiscation.

128
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:16,840
The new army manuals that we've listed and shown over 100 times here, they talk about

129
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:25,840
gun confiscation in US cities. This is now happening, this is now unfolding, this isn't

130
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:33,160
a game, this isn't a joke, this isn't a drill, this is the real deal. In fact, as soon as

131
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:41,960
infoawards.com is back up, we're rebooting it and doing some scans of the site.

132
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:47,440
As soon as it's back up, I'm gonna have Kurt Nemo, Paul Watson, I'm gonna have all of them.

133
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,360
Cuz I called Paul Watson about 7 this morning, even before I saw the Daily Caller. And I

134
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,840
said, we need to do a report on this congressman saying impeachment. And I said, impeachment

135
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,400
is the way to go.

136
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:05,020
And I said, now we've got to get on the offensive and we've got them on Fast and Furious, lying.

137
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:08,080
The Republicans could gut the Democratic Party right now for all the stuff they've done.

138
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,400
They don't want to cuz they're bought and paid for at the top by the same people, Boehner

139
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:15,440
and all the rest of them. They're traitors, they're Benedict Arnold's.

140
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,080
Three hearings last year where they told Congress NATO is now over the military and tells the

141
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:24,840
president what to do. We don't come to Congress, boom, instant impeachment. Obama ordering

142
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:29,520
the Department of Energy to shut down coal power plants outside of law, massively increasing

143
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:37,120
our power prices outside of congressional law, boom, impeachable right there.

144
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,940
And so I want Paul Watson, and I want Kurt Nemo, and I want Adan Salazar, and I want

145
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:46,520
Steve Watson. And I want all the rest of our riders, everybody else out there should be

146
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:53,840
beating the drum, beating the drum for all out impeachment. And we're gonna impeach Obama

147
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,840
publicly.

148
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:59,120
Hold on, Watson, listen, remember this morning I called you and I said the way to go is to

149
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,040
go after him and call for impeachment for all the stuff they've done. We need to put

150
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,480
out our own articles of impeachment. And I'm gonna talk about the articles of impeachment

151
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,760
on air in the next hour.

152
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:12,600
Okay, and you can go check everything I say historically and pull it up. There's at least

153
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:17,240
ten reasons, people always like the number ten, ten reasons to impeach Obama, that we

154
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:23,040
must impeach Obama now. Okay, we've gotta get on the offense. And we've gotta get behind

155
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,800
this Texas congressman and others, okay?

156
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:32,920
Because it's just all out. And by the way, while Infowars is down, you can go to prisonplanet.com.

157
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:37,080
And again, we're trying to upgrade and revamp the site so they can handle the increased

158
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:41,800
traffic. We're getting like three times the traffic we used to the last week and a half.

159
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:48,960
And it's just sustained. And the ad servers just can't handle it, so I'm suspending outside

160
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,960
ads.

161
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:54,100
So let's have our own house ads up there just to get the info out. So they're busy reloading

162
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:57,920
the site right now and everything else. And I'm just telling the listeners that right

163
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:02,920
now, prisonplanet.com is the backup auxiliary, be sure and go there. And Paul, we just need

164
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:07,920
to go through also, you and Steve are always good at ferreting out old articles.

165
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,240
How many articles did we write the last year saying he would become a dictator, he would

166
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:16,840
use executive orders and we have to impeach now. We need to also flashback so people understand

167
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:20,700
not hey, look, we're smart. Hey, look, we know what we're talking about, better listen

168
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,700
to us, okay?

169
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:29,800
So have somebody do a report on that, okay? All right, God bless you, my friend. Thank

170
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:35,960
you. All right, by the way, ladies and gentlemen, I guess Infowars is back up now. That was

171
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:42,040
Prison Planet, okay, Infowars should be back up soon.

172
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:47,700
New York State Senator, gun bill passed in the middle of the night turns law abiding

173
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:52,600
citizens into criminals. That's how mafia does it. New York Senate passes tough gun

174
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:58,360
control law. Paul, most Americans support new gun control measures after Newtown massacre.

175
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:03,360
By the way, this is how they play it. The Washington Post puts out some fraudulent poll.

176
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,240
Post polls show the majority of people are pro second amendment all the way. And it doesn't

177
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:13,900
matter if 51% say they wanna put me in chains and make me pull a plow, I don't have to do

178
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,080
it under natural law.

179
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:21,080
If 51% say I gotta turn my guns and I don't have to. If 51% say they support Obama becoming

180
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:26,040
a dictator, it's not just my right, it's my duty to resist. Do you understand the globalist

181
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:32,680
have installed dictators over multiple European countries? Do you understand we're going head

182
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,040
long into tyranny?

183
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:40,640
Look at this, Politico, Joe Biden, White House eyeing 19 executive actions on guns. Iowa

184
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:48,560
lawmaker calls for retroactive gun ban, confiscation of semi-automatic weapons. New York Assembly

185
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:56,920
Speaker Silver, we are going to ban assault weapons. Boom, gonna ban them, make you turn

186
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:01,920
them in. And see, that's what the bill that's passed the Senate in New York says.

187
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,520
That's what Cuomo said two weeks ago in the New York Times. People are like, this can't

188
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:10,200
be true. I mean, he's on the radio saying it. The New York Times wrote about it. We

189
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,280
wrote a story about it and people couldn't believe it. They wouldn't even follow the

190
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,360
links to find out it was true.

191
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:21,320
Because you can't believe it's actually coming to this. Yes, they're coming, they're coming,

192
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:26,920
they're coming for us. They want to get a shooting war started. That's why I went on

193
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:34,120
CNN and said don't start this. Because people need to know where this is going. People need

194
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:39,200
a heads up, ladies and gentlemen.

195
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:45,840
Let's play Rand Paul on gun control. And again, it's not gun control, folks. It's victim disarmament.

196
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:51,720
It's enslavement. We need to stop using their terms. Here's Rand Paul saying King Obama.

197
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,720
And Rand Paul-

198
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,800
I think it's having a king. I think having a monarch is what we fought the American Revolution

199
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:04,000
over. And someone who wants to bypass the Constitution, bypass Congress, that's someone

200
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,160
who wants to act like a king or a monarch. I've been opposed to executive orders, even

201
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:13,320
with Republican president. But one that wants to infringe on the Second Amendment, we will

202
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:19,320
fight tooth and nail. And I promise you there'll be no rock left unturned as far as trying

203
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:25,920
to stop him from usurping the Constitution, running roughshod over Congress. And you will

204
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:30,320
see one heck of a debate if he decides to try to do this.

205
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,820
Senator Paul spoke to us in our Jerusalem bureau. Look for more of his comments on the

206
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:37,960
Middle East and Israel in the days ahead.

207
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:46,240
That's not strong enough, Rand. Okay, you need to do what the Texas Congressman Steve

208
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:57,520
Stockman has done. Okay, you need to get aggressive right now. And we need to start, not threatening

209
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,880
impeachment. The president is saying he's gonna sign 19 executive orders taking our

210
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,180
guns, okay?

211
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:09,920
Now this is not a game. We've gotta come out and say this is illegal. The dictator word,

212
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:14,240
not the king word, the dictator, it's here, it's happening. Let's go out to break with

213
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,240
Rand Paul, here it is, one more time.

214
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:23,800
I'm against having a king. I think having a monarch is what we fought the American Revolution

215
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:30,000
over. And someone who wants to bypass the Constitution, bypass Congress, that's someone

216
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,520
who wants to act like a king or a monarch.

217
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,840
I've been opposed to executive orders even with Republicans.

218
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,320
That's good, we're gonna go to break, but listen to me and listen good. Dictator, we

219
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:45,160
are segueing into a dictatorship. People are like, well, wait, he got elected, Hitler got

220
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:49,400
elected. If you get elected and then overthrow the checks and balances, it's called a dictator.

221
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:54,920
The office is becoming a dictatorship. The executive run by the globalist, we're under

222
00:19:54,920 --> 00:20:00,600
occupation. Okay, those aren't words, that's the truth, we're occupied.

223
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:05,440
Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive from natural disasters

224
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:10,020
like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on

225
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:15,120
by a disastrous economy? Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything. At eFoods

228

wrote, almost all of the grocery stores are closed, but I managed to get my eFoods just

229
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:34,160

Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors

253
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:38,640
won't talk about gold IRAs? They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't

268
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:28,040
Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live here. Yesterday, I was on air talking about what

269
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:34,500
would Paul Revere do during this entire period of history. Mainline conservatives would call

270
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:38,080
him a traitor, and if he rode down the street saying to arms to arms, the redcoats are coming

271
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:42,320
to confiscate our guns, the average neocon would step out with pleasure and shoot him

272
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:47,320
from the horse, guaranteed, and then salute the redcoats.

273
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:51,360
And that's what some conservatives said about me. They said, you shouldn't yell, you shouldn't

274
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:58,840
get upset. Really, our forebears killed people. When someone comes to usurp and enslave you,

275
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,720
that's the response or you become a slave. I'm just trying to peacefully fix things.

276
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:09,560
I'm a wimp compared to Paul Revere. But then the super wimps call me bad. And here is Boston

277
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:19,560
Magazine, AMC is developing a show called We Hate Paul Revere.

278
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:26,080
Isn't that just cute? And it's all over TV and the culture bad mouthing the founders.

279
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:30,680
And they've got three or four different TV shows now that have just come out airing.

280
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:34,040
One's called Founding Fathers, where anybody who's a patriot's evil. And guess who they

281
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:40,800
waged war against? Gun owners during gun confiscation, and the gun owners are all horrible scum.

282
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:46,320
And the army infiltrates them and takes them down in Texas. They've actuated this out.

283
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:52,120
They knew it'd be Texas congressmen that resisted them like Steve Stockman. They knew, and so

284
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:57,960
they've got all these TV shows on ABC, NBC, all airing, where the bad guys are the gun

285
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:04,040
owning libertarians. They were all being developed last year.

286
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:07,960
That's why I said they're coming for the guns next year, because of that and hundreds of

287
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:17,560
other data points. They pre-program us, they get us ready. This is brainwashing. AMC is

288
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:22,800
not satisfied with Mad Men's foray in the 1960s is setting a new comedy in colonial

289
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:30,400
Boston and titling it We Hate Paul Revere.

290
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:35,500
And it's basically about two brothers who are not fans of industrialist and activist

291
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:40,480
Paul Revere. And then the show reportedly from Deadline Hollywood just makes the founders

292
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:47,160
look bad. I mean, whoa, a bunch of TV shows demonizing the founders. This is what a foreign

293
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:54,560
occupation force does. That isn't rhetoric, okay? And Obama's not becoming a king, he's

294
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:57,060
becoming a dictator.

295
00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:00,240
And that's why the Republicans are going, you know what, we'll legalize the illegals.

296
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,080
You know what, we will go for some gun control. You know what, we will raise taxes. You know

297
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:09,040
what, we are gonna go for Obamacare. Because they've been told, you sit down and you shut

298
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,040
up and you get in line.

299
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:14,360
We know about your insider trading, we know about your girlfriend, we know about your

300
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:21,320
boyfriend. A mafia takeover is taking place and I'm here going, hey man, we're in trouble.

301
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:27,320
I'm here having to do this, which is not fun, but it's my duty, and I will not be a slave.

302
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:30,640
And then I get to watch all these armchair quarterbacks going, man, you're going a little

303
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:36,600
far, don't raise your voice. Okay, fine, folks, they're gonna take everything, okay? You got

304
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,600
that?

305
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,280
They're gonna gut the country, open North American Union, toll roads on all the roads,

306
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:47,080
doubling, tripling water prices, energy prices. They are going to rape us. They've said they're

307
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:52,260
going to rape us. And as things get worse and worse, I was on Current TV with The Young

308
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,260
Turks last night.

309
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:57,680
And he's like, come on, all right, they secretly arrest us. They've got more wireless wiretapping.

310
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:02,960
They're setting up highway checkpoints. You're right, but still, do you need mental health?

311
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:08,600
You shouldn't get upset about this. And I'm like, you know what, you're mentally ill.

312
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:13,400
If I was in Nazi Germany in 1941 saying this is wrong, I would have been called insane.

313
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:17,320
If I was in the Aztec Kingdom 500 years ago, I would have been called insane for saying

314
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:22,680
don't have human sacrifices. That's what I said to him. He just laughed at me, man. It's

315
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:25,120
funny to these people.

316
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:29,200
All this is happening. It's all happening. It's all gonna get worse and worse. There's

317
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:35,600
army manuals on FEMA camps. There's army manuals on gun confiscation. And people are so cowardly

318
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:41,360
they flip it around and go, it's not that bad. Real cowards lie to themselves and say

319
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,480
something isn't happening or it's okay.

320
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:49,760
Yeah, all this is happening, but it's not that bad. And then I am mentally ill. Because

321
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:54,620
I see straight, I know history, I'm concerned, and I've got enough courage to get up here

322
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:59,440
and put my name, my honor, everything on the line. Folks, they're testing us right now.

323
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:05,120
If we bend over, ladies and gentlemen, if we lay down, they are gonna run right over

324
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:09,920
the top of us. Again, a lot of people hear this show and they go, man, you're scaring

325
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,920
me.

326
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:14,520
Why are you trying to scare us? I don't think you're cowards. I mean, look, if you're in

327
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:21,260
a parking lot and a guy comes up to you, and another guy behind you, and they go, we're

328
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:24,640
gonna beat the daylights out of you, might as well go ahead and fight. There's nowhere

329
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,840
to run, we're cornered in an alley.

330
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:31,880
I'm not gonna lay down while they can kick me in the teeth. I mean, it just isn't happening.

331
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:38,800
It's not an issue of courage. These are authoritarians who wanna gut this country. They're not liberals,

332
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:45,540
they're authoritarian monsters. And their minions will soon be saying, so they're arresting

333
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:49,720
right wingers, big deal, cuz they're now talking about that, just getting rid of us all.

334
00:29:49,720 --> 00:30:01,120
Here on the march, the empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

335
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:05,800
Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our

336
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:11,440

as our all natural silver soaps. Just released is our 100% natural silver gel. Our new silver

340
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:35,120
gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and leave the silver

341
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:40,660
at the surface. But rather, we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin nourishing

342
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:45,720
chemistry of aloe vera, to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin, while delivering the

343
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:54,160
silver more effectively. Visit www.silverlungs.com and click on our store page to find what silver-based

345
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:05,440
Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive? From natural disasters

346
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:10,020
like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought, to the family hardships brought on

347
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:14,960
by a disastrous economy. Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything. At eFoods

348
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:19,200

350
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:28,480
wrote, almost all of the grocery stores are closed, but I managed to get my eFoods just

351
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:34,160
in time to be able to help my sister and niece. It is better to be prepared 10 years too early

352
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:38,740
than one day too late. I can warn you, but I can't feed you. Heed the warnings and do

356
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:05,560
Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers. The prognosis for the entire planetary

357
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:11,160
economic system runs from bad to worse. The globalist model is to shut down societies

358
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:16,320
and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover. That's why we've assembled

359
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:21,860
the most vital and important preparedness items at infowarsshop.com. These are items

360
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:27,280
that I did research on, that I personally use. We've got the LifeStraw, so you can turn

361
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:32,560
fetid water into safe water anywhere you go. The Ktor hand crank generator to charge up

362
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:37,120
key equipment during power outages or out in the field. Strategic Relocation, third

363
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:42,720
edition by Joel Skousen. When Disaster Strikes by Matthew Stein. TheraSafe used by Homeland

364
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:48,960
Security to protect yourself during any radiological event. Hand crank shortwave AM-FM radios.

367
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:05,720
There's an old saying in Tennessee, I know it's in Texas probably in Tennessee that says

368
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:16,720
fool me once, shame on me, shame on you. Fool me, we can't get fooled again. He aligns himself

369
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:26,880
with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side. You're listening to Alex Jones. Again,

370
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:33,120
there are four different TV shows airing or about to air on broadcast TV and cable bad

371
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,840
mouthing the founding fathers.

372
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:41,280
Situational comedies running them down. I hate Paul Revere. Shows like founding fathers

373
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:47,700
and others coming out where they admit in the variety write ups that gun owners during

374
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:53,840
gun confiscation resist and they are dealt with. And the average yuppie will sit there

375
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:58,420
now and fantasize about being the SWAT teams hunting us down.

376
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:02,600
And most of these shows are based again in Texas. The globalists know where their resistance

377
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:09,200
is gonna come from. Because here's the deal, I can't give in to these people. Okay, I've

378
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:18,660
said I'm not turning my guns in. I am a political information person. I don't plan in the early

379
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:24,120
stages of this cuz I'm not gonna give them what they want, armed resistance.

380
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:28,200
You know, I'm not sitting there watching my back. If they pull up and take my guns after

381
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:33,540
they're banned, that will be something I'll try to fight through the courts and politically.

382
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:37,420
But they're not gonna stop there. They're all over the news saying lock up gun owners

383
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:40,780
and mental institutions. We're mentally ill because we don't wanna give up the Bill of

384
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:41,780
Rights.

385
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:47,480
When I was on Al Gore's foreign owned TV network owned by the Arabs last night, he sold it.

386
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:52,600
They were saying, do you need mental help? And I'm like, why? Because we have the NDAA

387
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:57,800
and secret arrest and army manuals training for gun confiscation and FEMA camps and all

388
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:01,800
this stuff coming true.

389
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:10,440
In fact, Bloomberg, here's one of the headlines. Bloomberg urged Obama to take executive action

390
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:17,000
and to ban guns outside of Congress. He urged him to defy Congress. That's Bloomberg, the

391
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,420
guy that wants to tell you what you can eat, where you can sleep, how big a house you can

392
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:24,620
live in, how many painkillers hospitals can give out.

393
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:30,120
He just has orders in New York. I order the hospitals not to distribute painkillers to

394
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:34,720
people. I mean, it's just, I'm God. I tell you what to eat. I tell doctors what to do.

395
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:42,060
It's called a dictator pig who swore he wouldn't run for reelection and then got the law changed.

396
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:49,140
He helped passed on term limits. I mean, it's just a fraud. A guy with armed guards, a gangster.

397
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:53,840
There have been 50 plus thousand signatures signed in Mexico to the Mexican government

398
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:58,500
calling for the US citizens to have all our guns taken like the poor Mexican people who've

399
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:03,900
had total gun bans and the highest crime rate in the world, almost 60,000 dead the last

400
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:06,340
five years.

401
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:11,400
Just mercilessly under the control of mafia and mafia government and our government saying,

402
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:15,000
yes, the Mexicans want us to turn our guns and we better do it. And we've got the British

403
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:20,660
government and we've got Piers Morgan and the Russian TV and the Chinese TV, all saying

404
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:28,060
take their guns. And the UN treaty coming up in March. They've got the whole world guns

405
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:34,900
confiscated and they've got to get us in line with global governance.

406
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:40,140
And again, the impeachment must start now for Obama three times last year in a letter

407
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:44,580
and three congressional committees saying NATO is over our military. And Congress said,

408
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:50,060
no, wait, we fund the military. We direct all that and the president executes it like

409
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:52,240
the football coach.

410
00:36:52,240 --> 00:37:02,180
But he's given the playbook agreed upon by the general manager. And they said, no, we're

411
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:09,260
going to be under NATO command. Boom, impeach him for that. Obama needs to be impeached

412
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:12,820
for Fast and Furious. They've all been caught perjuring themselves and lying. We have them

413
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:16,420
doing press conferences before they even got caught shipping the guns in, talking about

414
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:21,260
the Operation Gunwalker and Fast and Furious.

415
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:23,740
People that said they never knew about it were doing press conferences on it when they

416
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:28,340
were promoting it, when the public didn't know the full extent of it. Boom, perjury

417
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:33,260
right there. Obama shutting down power plants so that his buddies in General Electric make

418
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:35,380
bigger profits and increasing our power prices.

419
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:39,860
When Congress didn't pass his carbon tax legislation three years ago, he's still just doing it

420
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:46,700
by executive fiat. We need to start the impeachment of Obama for directing the auto bailout to

421
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:52,140
spend $20 plus billion to ship General Motors, Volt, and Cadillac factories to Eastern Europe,

422
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:58,060
China, and Brazil. Boom, impeach for that economic espionage against this country.

423
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:07,740
Get impeachment for his environmental departments and people involved in using shadow email

424
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:12,540
systems throughout his administration. Start the impeachment hearings now and start the

425
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:20,780
impeachment hearing saying he can use executive orders to restrict our Second Amendment.

426
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:27,000
And actively promoting that sedition and that treason against our republic. What more evidence

427
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:39,740
do you need? And the executive power grabs just go on from there. The conflicts of interest.

428
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:44,100
He needs to be impeached. Of course, Congress is involved in treason as well. But it doesn't

429
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:49,100
mean you can't have good members that voted against it on the NDAA to secretly arrest

430
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,100
Americans.

431
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:57,940
Here's a big one. His secret order on cybersecurity, which then the EU and others bragged, that

432
00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:01,900
gives him control of the Internet. He's gonna give the UN control of the Internet. Congress

433
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:08,420
being told two months ago, you can't see my secret order, my secret cyber order when Congress

434
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:13,700
has the power of the purse and the power over the agencies as a checks and balance.

435
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:21,360
He said, I signed a secret order. And the impeachable offenses go on and on and on.

436
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:30,260
But chief amongst them is Obama saying he's preparing to act with executive orders. Also,

437
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:36,360
he had the ATF last year with a rule, rulemaking order gun shops when they sold more than two

438
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:41,500
guns to report it to ATF as a suspicious transaction to order a criminal investigation.

439
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:45,620
And to open that when it's already on record that you bought firearms through the instant

440
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:55,300
check, and that's law. What they did is outside of law, extrajudicial. I mean, there's many

441
00:39:55,300 --> 00:40:00,500
other examples, and many a constitutional lawyer has pointed this out. And by the way,

442
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,780
I wanna get Edwin Viera on.

443
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:11,620
I wanna get Lou Rockwell back on. I wanna get constitutional lawyer Fine back on to

444
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:17,740
pick their brains and other examples, and we need to codify articles of impeachment.

445
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:23,700
I want Paul Watson to take the points I just put together. Write the article, I'll approve

446
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:29,660
it during the broadcast later, slap my name on it, my John Hancock on it, and we'll put

447
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:34,700
that out there. Just an example to people, because we gotta ride out like Paul Revere

448
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:37,980
and at least point out the treason that's going on.

449
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:45,500
I mean, are there any men left in this country? Is there anybody that cares about freedom

450
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:52,660
left in this country? I got another one for you. Obama last year signed a directive, not

451
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:59,860
an executive order, not a national security order, not a PDD, presidential decision directive.

452
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:10,940
Just a directive, just a letter to ICE saying this large swath of illegal aliens, do we

453
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:11,940
forget this?

454
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:17,220
This is why he's now saying he'll just take our guns, cuz he's gotten away with it. He

455
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:20,980
comes out and he says, I'm gonna sign this order saying we're just gonna go ahead and

456
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:27,860
legalize these illegal aliens kids who weren't born here, but they're under 18. And so we're

457
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:35,220
just gonna legalize you, we're just gonna say you're legal now.

458
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:38,580
And now he's talking about an executive order just legalizing all the illegal aliens that

459
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:42,300
are here and then letting them bring their families here. And then they're all gonna

460
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:46,100
be on welfare, and then they're all going to be able to go vote illegally. We all know

461
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:48,380
that goes on all day long.

462
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:52,060
Cuz they give them driver's licenses everywhere, you got driver's licenses, you vote. And it's,

463
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:59,500
hey, we already got 56,000 Mexicans being reported, signing a petition. I mean, look

464
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:04,140
at these headlines, Joe Biden, White House eyeing 19 executive actions on guns. They're

465
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:09,220
eyeing executive actions and they're saying, we're gonna lean on gun manufacturers, lean

466
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:10,860
on the retailers.

467
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:16,260
What did Chuck Schumer say? They've said their plan, they've gone and had public meetings.

468
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:24,620
We saw Rahm Emanuel say, the police are over, who can have guns now. The public isn't part

469
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:29,700
of that discussion now. I'm gonna play that clip in a moment. Joe Biden, White House eyeing

470
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:33,420
19 executive actions on guns, Politico.

471
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:38,780
Iowa lawmaker calls for retroactive gun ban, confiscation of semi-automatic weapons, door-to-door

472
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:46,460
confiscation. Daily Times Herald out of Iowa. New York Assembly Speaker, Silver, we are

473
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:51,780
going to ban assault weapons, CBS News, and make you physically turn them in. Boom, you

474
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:52,780
hearing this?

475
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:57,740
I thought I was a fear monger. By decree of the king, there are some steps we can take

476
00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:01,460
that don't require legislation. That's Obama. We're gonna play that clip in a minute. Rahm

477
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:05,980
Emanuel, quote, take American people out of Second Amendment debate. Let me keep going

478
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:13,460
here. In New York, preparing to put gun owners in mental hospitals.

479
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:18,700
New York Senate passes draconian gun bill. Sheriff says teachers should be armed, Second

480
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:23,500
Amendment shall not be infringed. That's in Kentucky. Folks are standing, that sheriff

481
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:28,180
starts crying a little bit. He goes, I'm ashamed of the founding fathers were here. But he's

482
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:31,100
freaking out cuz he realizes he's committed.

483
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:35,780
He's drawn his line in the sand and he gets sad, not because he's scared. He's realizing

484
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:41,460
what's happened here. How much trouble we're in. All you people out there need to get your

485
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:46,540
heads out of the sand, folks. They're going for this cuz they think you're weak. That's

486
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:47,540
what I told Piers Morgan.

487
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:52,460
I said, there's gonna be some of us aren't going along. I'm not gonna play into your

488
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:58,580
hands. They come to me and take me out, folks. I'm not planning to resist. I want that on

489
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:02,900
record because the minute I said I would resist them, they'll come kill me. And they don't

490
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:08,340
care about the minions that come. I'm out in the open here. But this is the waters we've

491
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:09,340
entered.

492
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:14,980
This is it. We're entering DEFCON 1 for the Second Amendment, ladies and gentlemen. If

493
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:25,260
you don't know what DEFCON is, DEFCON, you better find out. Rand Paul slams King Obama

494
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:34,220
over executive order threat. Report, Walmart forbids new ammunition orders.

495
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:40,580
Mike Adams, war, thou son of hell. As America stands on the verge of domestic war, my heart

496
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:49,100
sobs for histories. And history harshly learned. And then I've got my articles here in the

497
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:57,420
stack. In fact, I had that in my stack where it's up on infowars.com, it's now back up.

498
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:03,860
Here it is, 54,000 Mexicans signed petition, that's out of Fox News, for US gun control

499
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:09,420
and for us to have our guns taken. Oakland leaders have lost grip on violence. Everything's

500
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:15,900
disintegrating.

501
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:18,580
And a lot of people are just like, well, I'll just do what they want. I'll just turn them

502
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:22,780
around. They're gonna take everything, folks. They are already doubling power prices in

503
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:25,980
many areas of the country, shutting down the power plants that are city and state owned,

504
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:27,540
that are totally clean.

505
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:31,820
So General Electric makes huge profits. They wanna bankrupt you, they want you poor. This

506
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:36,300
is like Stalin shutting off the food and not letting farmers produce their own food in

507
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:42,420
Ukraine. Let's start going to these clips. Let's go to Rand Paul one more time, saying

508
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:48,220
King Obama. And then we'll go to Obama saying, I can accomplish through executive order.

509
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:49,460
Let's go to that.

510
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:54,820
I'm against having a king. I think having a monarch is what we fought the American Revolution

511
00:45:54,820 --> 00:46:01,260
over. And someone who wants to bypass the Constitution, bypass Congress, that's someone

512
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:03,220
who wants to act like a king or a monarch.

513
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:04,220
All right, that's enough.

514
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:05,220
I've been opposed to executive order.

515
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:08,820
And he goes on to say, he'll do whatever he can in the law and Congress will fight him.

516
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:13,020
No, impeach now. And by the way, people are like, why are they so arrogant? This is so

517
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:18,540
illegal what they're doing. They're going to stage false flags and blame it on the Patriots.

518
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:22,540
You can bet your bottom dollar that they're gonna blow stuff up and then play clips of

519
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:25,740
people like myself saying 1776 will commence.

520
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:30,700
And we've got to have people on the ground the minute stuff happens videotaping. That's

521
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:34,540
one thing holding them back is when they did the underwear bombing thing when they staged

522
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:39,300
that. We had witnesses that were there and saw it and later it came out in Congress that

523
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:41,020
indeed it was a government operation.

524
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:48,620
Yeah, that came out. So again, ladies and gentlemen, they're gonna hit more schools.

525
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:52,300
I have no doubt they were behind Sandy Hook. You can see it all riding on the wall. All

526
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:58,620
the evidence is there. Look it up for yourself. And this is their season. They're going for

527
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:06,020
broke. And police and military better understand the plan is for us to kill each other.

528
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:14,480
Okay, let's go to the next clip here. This is Obama in his press conference yesterday.

529
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:21,420
And Biden's saying it's 19 orders he's planning. 19 things. This is a purge against gun owners.

530
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:25,700
They want a war. That's why they're now saying he is Lincoln. I told you four years ago this

531
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:26,700
was a plan.

532
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:32,980
He is Lincoln, his face on Lincoln. He is Lincoln. He will crush us. He will show us.

533
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:37,080
He will show us the federal power. Here is Lincoln right now.

534
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:42,220
My understanding is the vice president's gonna provide a range of steps that we can take

535
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:47,820
to reduce gun violence. Some of them will require legislation. Some of them I can accomplish

536
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:53,140
through executive action. And so I'll be reviewing those today. And as I said, I'll speak in

537
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:58,640
more detail to what we're gonna go ahead and propose later in the week.

538
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:03,300
But I'm confident that there's some steps that we can take that don't require legislation

539
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:11,660
and that are within my authority as president. And where you get a step that has the opportunity

540
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:14,420
to reduce the possibility of gun violence.

541
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:18,540
That's enough. It all goes on, the articles up at mfullwars.com and prisonblonded.com

542
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:26,260
right now. He says he can have warrantless wiretapping without law of you cuz he's God.

543
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:30,780
He says he can shut down our power plants without law. He's God. He can give waivers

544
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:33,900
to his friends and not have to get Obamacare for their employees. He's God. He can say

545
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:35,300
that well, he's not God.

546
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:40,180
The UN and NATO are God and they say he can launch wars cuz he's a peace prize winner.

547
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:44,300
The plan is to try to start a civil war and use homeland security that was set up day

548
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:50,840
one to attack the states, legislatures and the people. And this is pre-Obama. The John

549
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:56,460
Warren Defense Authorization Act of 2007. Now six years ago, five and a half years ago,

550
00:48:56,460 --> 00:49:00,540
states for insurrection by the states and legislatures.

551
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:05,700
Obama was scripted for his role of Lincoln from the beginning. And now they admit it.

552
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:10,220
He's gonna be our Lincoln, but not Lincoln for a north versus south that you can debate.

553
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:14,340
And Lincoln was a tyrant. You can't debate the fact that he arrested hundreds of newspaper

554
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:19,940
editors, members of Congress, you name it. It was martial law by a dictator. He overturned

555
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:26,940
theirs. This is a occupying dictator under a foreign corporate takeover and they've already

556
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:35,360
got countries like Spain, to a great extent, but the ones that are 100% are Italy and Greece

557
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:41,440
where they appoint the technocratic leaders, the former Goldman Sachs heads.

558
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:46,220
And they're gonna do it. And they want war with the American people. Let's go to one

559
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:53,540
more clip here. This is Obama. I won't take your guns away. I won't take your guns.

560
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:57,060
When y'all go home and you're talking to your buddies and they say, he wants to take my

561
00:49:57,060 --> 00:50:04,460
gun away. You've heard it here. I'm on television, so everybody knows it. I believe in the Second

562
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:11,900
Amendment. I believe in people's lawful right to bear arms. I will not take your shotgun

563
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:19,620
away. I will not take your rifle away. I won't take your handgun away.

564
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:26,460
But they're now saying that they're going to order everyone under executive order, that's

565
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:30,080
what they're floating in the Washington Post, you name it, to come and get your lawfully

566
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:35,500
already bought guns or guns your grandfather gave you when he died, some semi-auto from

567
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:40,500
the 50s. And you're gonna go in while gangsters, let me tell you, they're gangsters, I've been

568
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:44,700
around them. They're going to say, all right, hey, you're looking at me wrong. You got a

569
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:52,460
problem? I'll arrest you right now. Line up. Get the serial number. Now get out, get out

570
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:57,540
of here, you American trash. That's how they talk to you. Get out of here. They're gangsters.

571
00:50:57,540 --> 00:51:00,620
They know they got to be in your face to keep you down.

572
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:04,360
If you've ever wanted one of our best selling generators, but we're waiting for an offer

573
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:09,300
so crazy you couldn't refuse, then you're not going to want to miss this exciting message.

574
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:15,120
Here's why. Our solar generators provide life-saving electrical power. And unlike gas generators,

575
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:20,220
solar generators run quietly, emit no fumes, and produce electricity from the sun. So when

576
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:25,060
the lights go out, you'll always have the power you need. Now here's the best part.

577
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:30,260
Every year we accumulate a few solar generators that we just can't sell as new. We put them

578
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:35,600
in a special spot in our warehouse, and we discount them heavily at the end of each year.

579
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:40,500
We call them scratch and dent units, but they're really just like new. Each unit comes with

580
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:45,500
a full factory warranty and special bonuses you just won't believe. Don't wait. They go

581
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:51,100
fast. Go to scratchanddentsolar.com. That's scratchanddentsolar.com. For the craziest

582
00:51:51,100 --> 00:52:00,300
offer we've ever made, go to scratchanddentsolar.com. That's scratchanddentsolar.com.

583
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:05,320
We can buy GMOs stressed out about money and blasted by the electric environment. Hi, I'm

584
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:10,780
Pastor Ginny, and that was the state I was in back in 2010. Then I learned about RNA

585
00:52:10,780 --> 00:52:17,140
drops. I learned that 97% of my DNA that scientists have called junk is actually packed with millions

586
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:21,900
of gene switches that play a critical role in controlling how my cells, organs, and other

587
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:26,140
tissues behave. I learned I don't have to put up with disease decay or decline like

I'd been conditioned to believe. I began taking RNA drops, a 100% natural formula designed

Box. I want you to know some very important information. In 1985, President Ronald Reagan

595
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:14,000

596
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:19,580
president could obtain its world-class healer. Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are

597

It's the only one you've got.

604
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:40,580
So I defended myself. I shot the sheriff.

605
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:59,980
He's done his self-defense. Let's cue up Obama one more time. We'll play it in a second saying

606
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:05,360
I won't take your guns because it's now official. They've told the establishment a mouthpiece

607
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:10,140
Washington Post where they've been announcing all their plans. White House to announce gun

608
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:16,540
plans Wednesday, which they said they do before New Haven even happened, before Sandy Hook

609
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:21,340
happened, before Aurora happened. President Obama will unveil a sweeping set of gun control

610
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:27,700
proposals, victim disarmament, at midday Wednesday, high noon, including an assault weapons ban.

611
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:32,060
And they're saying it's going to be a physical turn in. Universal background checks and limits

612
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:36,700
on the number of bullets magazines can hold, according to sources familiar with the plans.

613
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:40,500
The announcement to be delivered by the White House is also expected to include a slate

614
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:48,180
of up to 19 executive actions that the Obama administration can take on its own to attempt

615
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:53,340
to limit gun violence. The White House has invited key lawmakers as well as gun control

616
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:58,300
advocates to appear at Wednesday's policy rollout, according to two officials who have

617
00:55:58,300 --> 00:55:59,780
been invited to the event.

618
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:03,980
Obama said at the news conference Monday that he would present his gun proposals later this

619
00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:12,100
week. A White House spokesman said Tuesday morning that he could not confirm the plans.

620
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:17,540
And ladies and gentlemen, Bloomberg is out, there's video of it, running around saying

621
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:24,900
just defy Congress, take them. Man, I mean, whoa, the headline should read Bloomberg calls

622
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:27,700
for Obama to become open dictator.

623
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:34,940
And I'll say this, and I've said it a million times, I will not bow to this. I am not going

624
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:39,980
along with this. I may selfishly get my family out of the country. It just continues to degenerate

625
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:45,480
this fast. But I am gonna stay here and deal with this. And believe me, that's not some

626
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:46,480
macho thing.

627
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:51,660
I'm not happy about this. I'm really sad. And folks, you should be freaked out. If your

628
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:55,180
preachers are telling you go along with this, they're scum, leave that church. If your local

629
00:56:55,180 --> 00:57:00,660
talk show host is going along with this, they're scum. Now's the time to say no, no, no, you

630
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:02,300
shall not pass.

631
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:09,040
You shall not pass this gate. You shall not do this. Folks, there are a bunch of lawless

632
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:13,720
globalists that strip countries down ruthlessly. If they'll do this to us, they'll do anything,

633
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:17,980
and they are, they're gutting everything. They've already taken 47 trillion from us

634
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:19,220
offshore.

635
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:26,620
They're bankrupting us. We're going into bondage. It's world government. They're like, but they

636
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:30,780
already run everything. Why are they doing this? Because they want war. They want domination.

637
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:35,620
They want control. They hate you. They hate real Americans. They know you're not gonna

638
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:42,700
turn your guns in. They want this to happen. They want a civil war.

639
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:45,820
I just hope that when the history of this is written and these people end up losing

640
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:51,260
that we have, like they supposedly had Nazi hunters, I hope these people are hunted down

641
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:56,900
worldwide and brought to justice. No matter what happens to me, do not let them run to

642
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:58,700
South America.

643
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:03,900
Do not let them run to other countries. These people need to be held accountable. Nuremberg

644
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:08,020
trials for all of them. Let's go out to break with Obama's pledge that he wasn't coming

645
00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:10,860
after any of your guns. Here it is.

646
00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:16,940
When y'all go home and you're talking to your buddies and he wants to take my gun away.

647
00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:23,660
You've heard it here. I'm on television. Everybody knows it. I believe in the Second Amendment.

648
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:30,220
I believe in people's lawful right to bear arms. I will not take your shotgun away. I

649
00:58:30,220 --> 00:58:35,420
will not take your rifle away. I won't take your handgun away.

650
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:41,900
We'll be back. I have a stack of articles saying they're going to confiscate our guns.

651
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:50,900
This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.

652
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:54,900
Millions of people are going to get sick this winter from colds, flu and other illnesses.

653
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:59,660

665
01:00:11,580 --> 01:00:20,420
Well so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now live from Austin, Texas,

666
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:32,820
Alex Jones. America is being completely overthrown. There's been a lot of attacks on us. Our health

667
01:00:32,820 --> 01:00:42,300
freedom, forced inoculations going on outside of law. The open borders, all of it.

668
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:46,900
But now they're talking about executive orders to restrict our Second Amendment. There's

669
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:51,580
an all out call for Obama to basically be a dictator. It's very, very sad. I've had

670
01:00:51,580 --> 01:00:56,340
him scheduled for a few weeks. We're gonna talk to him about 30, 40 minutes and then

671
01:00:56,340 --> 01:01:00,660
we'll get back into how we need to move with articles of impeachment.

672
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:07,020
And I wanted to get him on about what gluten does in the gut. Cuz I'm trying to go gluten

673
01:01:07,020 --> 01:01:13,420
free myself. And my wife's done it and had some amazing results and also wanted to get

674
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:20,700
his take on the flu. And they admit they never guess which flu vaccine needs to be formulated

675
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:26,000
to actually give you some protection from the flu, so it's a total hoax.

676
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:30,700
And so it was such a popular interview we did about six months ago that I have twisted

677
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:37,460
the arm of Theo Ratliff, the just now retired famous NBA star. Back on, well, this is coming

678
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:41,980
up in the next segment, and Doc Wallach, to just talk about health news in general, but

679
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:47,080
also talk about the fact that the establishment knows that we've got mineral and vitamin deficiencies

680
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:48,420
and trace element deficiencies.

681
01:01:48,420 --> 01:01:54,260
But out of the gates, Dr. Wallach, what is your take on the move to disarm the American

682
01:01:54,260 --> 01:01:57,460
people with executive orders? I mean, if they can take the guns, they're gonna be able to

683
01:01:57,460 --> 01:01:58,460
take the supplements.

684
01:01:58,460 --> 01:02:04,180
Well, exactly right. Basically, I don't think the American people are gonna allow that to

685
01:02:04,180 --> 01:02:09,580
happen. I don't care what the Congress does. I deal a lot with farmers. I deal a lot with

686
01:02:09,580 --> 01:02:14,900
the average person. I'm out there giving 300 free lectures a year, Alex, all across this

687
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:15,900
planet.

688
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:22,580
And what we find out is that absolutely the American public is not gonna tolerate their

689
01:02:22,580 --> 01:02:28,420
weapons being taken away for self-defense. It is not gonna happen.

690
01:02:28,420 --> 01:02:31,820
What are folks telling you out there across the country you talk to?

691
01:02:31,820 --> 01:02:36,940
Well, people are digging holes and putting their weapons in. People are buying from each

692
01:02:36,940 --> 01:02:43,420
other as opposed to official areas. They're accumulating guns from, grandmas and grandpas

693
01:02:43,420 --> 01:02:44,900
aren't gonna use them.

694
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:52,060
And they're actually accumulating weapons from private sales as opposed to sales from

695
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:58,380
a Walmart or a Costco's or maybe a big sporting store, you know, these big five stores and

696
01:02:58,380 --> 01:03:03,100
things like that that sell weapons. So they're going to private sales.

697
01:03:03,100 --> 01:03:10,740
Well, I tell you, these are the times that tries people's souls. Why do you think the

698
01:03:10,740 --> 01:03:15,500
system is so bold to actually try to go after our guns right now, Dr. Wallach?

699
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:18,780
Didn't Eric Holder say that crisis is a terrible thing to waste?

700
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:24,180
Yeah, they've all said things, Rahm Emanuel, you name it.

701
01:03:24,180 --> 01:03:31,060
And so basically what they're doing is they're using this tragic story of this new town,

702
01:03:31,060 --> 01:03:35,060
what is it, Connecticut, where these kids were all shot.

703
01:03:35,060 --> 01:03:37,340
Yeah, Sandy Hook, it's outside there, yeah.

704
01:03:37,340 --> 01:03:42,500
Yeah, okay. And so basically, they missed the whole point. Really, when you look back

705
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:47,260
and actually in the book, Rare Earths Been Cures, which you have in your bookstore, Rare

706
01:03:47,260 --> 01:03:53,420
Earths Been Cures, there's a whole section on these types of mass murders. And basically,

707
01:03:53,420 --> 01:03:59,820
they are caused by psychologists who don't want to give up their weekly check from talk

708
01:03:59,820 --> 01:04:04,180
therapy. They know, and there's actually laws in the cities and then the counties and in

709
01:04:04,180 --> 01:04:10,140
the states and federal government, where a caregiver who is a psychologist or psychiatrist

710
01:04:10,140 --> 01:04:15,180
can, in fact, have somebody institutionalized that they feel they're of eminent danger to

711
01:04:15,180 --> 01:04:20,060
themselves or the community. But the psychologists and psychiatrists say, you know, if I just

712
01:04:20,060 --> 01:04:24,740
put them on one more drug, I can keep them out of the institution because they give up

713
01:04:24,740 --> 01:04:28,100
their weekly check if they put them in an institution.

714
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:34,060
And when you look at the records of these people who are managing these individuals

715
01:04:34,060 --> 01:04:37,620
who do the mass murder of serial killers, they've been working with them for a long

716
01:04:37,620 --> 01:04:40,180
time. It's not like it's any mystery that these people are dangerous.

717
01:04:40,180 --> 01:04:44,180
They know exactly, you know what, I want to recap that. And then obviously get Theo's

718
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:48,740
take on this because it's such big news right now. And then we'll get into, you know, ADHD,

719
01:04:48,740 --> 01:04:51,420
you name it. I mean, they know vitamins and minerals are the answer. They know getting

720
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:54,540
people off the the dyes of the answer. And I'm gonna talk about some of the incredible

721

products as well from Young Jevity available at Infowarshealth.com.

01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:20,100
one of the most impressive police states on Earth. This film conclusively proves the existence

735
01:06:20,100 --> 01:06:25,900
of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide. This documentary exposes

736
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:30,660
how the continuity of government program has established an all powerful shadow state.

737
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:35,260
Police state four chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen. Prepare

738
01:06:35,260 --> 01:06:41,140
to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship, body scanners, sound cameras,

739
01:06:41,140 --> 01:06:45,780
citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner. It's only the beginning

740
01:06:45,780 --> 01:06:51,900
of the New World Order's hellish plan. The police state isn't coming. It's here. Secure

742
01:07:00,340 --> 01:07:05,220
Coming back on 2012, we ask ourselves how did we ever survive from natural disasters

743
01:07:05,220 --> 01:07:09,780
like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on

744
01:07:09,780 --> 01:07:14,740
by a disastrous economy. Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything. At E Foods

745
01:07:14,740 --> 01:07:18,980
Direct we hear from customers every day that are fortunate enough to weather life's storm

746
01:07:18,980 --> 01:07:23,500
by having a supply of food on hand. After Hurricane Sandy, Danny from New York City

747
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:29,180
wrote almost all the grocery stores are closed but I managed to get my E Foods just in time

748
01:07:29,180 --> 01:07:33,940
to be able to help my sister and niece. It is better to be prepared ten years too early

749
01:07:33,940 --> 01:07:38,540
than one day too late. I can warn you but I can't feed you. Heed the warnings and do

753
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:28,500
You know we're all about solutions on this broadcast. Thank you for joining us. I'm your

754
01:08:35,180 --> 01:08:42,100
host Alex Jones. It is Tuesday the 15th day of January 2013. And if you just tuned in,

755
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:46,860
the White House is talking about 19 executive orders to restrict the Second Amendment. Joe

756
01:08:46,860 --> 01:08:52,460
Biden headline, White House eyeing 19 executive actions on guns.

757
01:08:52,460 --> 01:08:56,820
Multiple Congress people now are coming out saying that more and more the executive branch

758
01:08:56,820 --> 01:09:01,660
is becoming a dictatorship or a king. New York Assembly Speaker says we are going to

759
01:09:01,660 --> 01:09:08,980
ban assault weapons. That's all semi-autos. Continuing here, just incredible news. Rahm

760
01:09:08,980 --> 01:09:12,900
Emanuel, we haven't played this clip again yet. We're gonna play it later in the hour.

761
01:09:12,900 --> 01:09:16,580
He says hey, the people don't have a right to even debate guns. The police will run things

762
01:09:16,580 --> 01:09:22,180
now. They'll decide. I mean, that's called dictatorship. That's the Chicago mob boss

763
01:09:22,180 --> 01:09:23,180
Emanuel.

764
01:09:23,180 --> 01:09:26,280
Now that is just some of what's coming up. And in about 40 minutes, I'll play a special

765
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:32,300
report by Aaron showing different sheriffs and police saying they're not gonna be part

766
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:40,180
of this. So this is a big, big deal. The articles are all up at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.

767
01:09:40,180 --> 01:09:44,940
But I also wanted to talk about solutions here today. And a few weeks ago, it was one

768
01:09:44,940 --> 01:09:47,700
of the most popular interviews we've done on health.

769
01:09:47,700 --> 01:09:52,900
I wanted to get Theo Ratliff on the broadcast. He just retired. He was able to stay in the

770
01:09:52,900 --> 01:09:58,500
NBA 10 years more than he would have with Dr. Joel Wallach's research. And we promote

771
01:09:58,500 --> 01:10:02,300
all the products that they've developed at infowarshealth.com. When you purchase them

772
01:10:02,300 --> 01:10:05,340
there, it also supports our transmission.

773
01:10:05,340 --> 01:10:09,980
So I've got Theo back on to talk about his experience just with minerals and vitamins

774
01:10:09,980 --> 01:10:15,380
with proprietary systems that have been developed by Dr. Wallach. He's an American former professional

775
01:10:15,380 --> 01:10:20,420
basketball player who played last with the NBA Los Angeles Lakers, primarily a center.

776
01:10:20,420 --> 01:10:25,420
He was an excellent shot blocker who's led the league three times in blocks per game.

777
01:10:25,420 --> 01:10:32,140
As of 2011, he's ranked 18th all time in career blocks and 13th all time for career blocks

778
01:10:32,140 --> 01:10:33,140
per game.

779
01:10:33,140 --> 01:10:38,100
Also a great rebounder. And of course, Ratliff played basketball at Dinopoulos High School

780
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:44,460
and later graduated from University of Wyoming. And again, he is one of the people that work

781
01:10:44,460 --> 01:10:48,900
with Dr. Wallach and others to develop the product Rebound, the ultimate sports drink

782
01:10:48,900 --> 01:10:52,980
that I know my wife, who's a sports addict, absolutely swears by.

783
01:10:52,980 --> 01:10:58,020
I personally am a big Polymers Plus guy and beyond tangy tangerine. And again, all of

784
01:10:58,020 --> 01:11:04,060
them discounted. Occasionally we do infomercial here amongst the info at infowarshealth.com.

785
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:07,900
You can sign up there and get free shipping or become a distributor and get discounts

786
01:11:07,900 --> 01:11:12,940
at infowarshealth.com. But the plugging out of the way, there's a cornucopia of things

787
01:11:12,940 --> 01:11:18,900
I wanted to get both these men on the broadcast about, and we'll get Theo to talk about his

788
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:21,320
experiences and what's happened with him.

789
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:30,540
But number one, Dr. Wallach, I mean, yesterday we posted an article with Samjay Gupta, how

790
01:11:30,540 --> 01:11:36,220
do you pronounce his name? Gupta, yeah, the brain surgeon on CNN saying almost all these

791
01:11:36,220 --> 01:11:40,460
shooters have been on psychotropics Prozac type drugs. And then the former head of Homeland

792
01:11:40,460 --> 01:11:45,140
Security came out, Governor Ridge, and said we should look at these drugs.

793
01:11:45,140 --> 01:11:48,580
Because in almost every case, these are involved. And of course, for those that don't know who

794
01:11:48,580 --> 01:11:55,820
Dr. Wallach is, I'm not gonna go over his entire giant bio. But he is a doctor of veterinary

795
01:11:55,820 --> 01:11:59,340
medicine that worked for the federal government and did all these autopsies and found out

796
01:11:59,340 --> 01:12:01,580
a lot of stuff because of mineral deficiencies.

797
01:12:01,580 --> 01:12:06,300
He's also got several other doctor's degrees on top of it. Some reason I don't have his

798
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:10,620
bio here in front of me today, but it's lengthy and it's up at info.warshealth.com. There's

799
01:12:10,620 --> 01:12:20,220
other videos there where that's all introduced. But he joins us now. Dr. Wallach, also a lot

800
01:12:20,220 --> 01:12:24,100
of these behavioral things they admit are the dyes in the processed foods.

801
01:12:24,100 --> 01:12:29,180
And the chemicals that are in the processed foods like McNuggets, they admit have, well,

802
01:12:29,180 --> 01:12:33,980
but basically it is silicone, like you have in breast implants. How do they get away with

803
01:12:33,980 --> 01:12:38,220
this? And as more and more kids drink Cokes all day and eat Snickers bars, and then they're

804
01:12:38,220 --> 01:12:42,700
bound, I mean, if I eat a Snickers bar and then crash an hour later, I wanna beat somebody

805
01:12:42,700 --> 01:12:43,700
up.

806
01:12:43,700 --> 01:12:46,980
I mean, I'm in a horrible mood. If I eat a well-balanced meal, drink some Beyond Tangy

807
01:12:46,980 --> 01:12:51,140
Tangerine, I mean, I feel great. And I can work a lot harder because of Beyond Tangy

808
01:12:51,140 --> 01:12:55,940
Tangerine and the essential fatty acids. The system knows this, but they don't want, they

809
01:12:55,940 --> 01:13:00,100
don't, you were talking in the last segment about what psychiatrists and psychologists

810
01:13:00,100 --> 01:13:03,740
are doing, people that should be locked up.

811
01:13:03,740 --> 01:13:08,820
This woman, she had her guns through background checks, registration, draconian gun laws in

812
01:13:08,820 --> 01:13:13,340
Connecticut. None of these gun laws would have stopped this guy, but they're blaming

813
01:13:13,340 --> 01:13:18,780
gun owners now. What's happening on that front? Then we'll get Theo's take on that and then

814
01:13:18,780 --> 01:13:19,780
give his testimonial.

815
01:13:19,780 --> 01:13:26,100
Sure. Well, certainly gun owners are not default here. Basically, it's the medical system.

816
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:30,860
You've hit the nail on the head again, Alex, you're just a genius at this kind of stuff.

817
01:13:30,860 --> 01:13:34,940
But it's the medical system that has failed us terribly. There was a wonderful study that

818
01:13:34,940 --> 01:13:39,700
was done in Texas in your state where they looked at two counties, and I get those counties

819
01:13:39,700 --> 01:13:44,400
for you, where they looked at the violent crime, they looked at domestic violence, they

820
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:48,880
looked at suicides, and two adjoining counties, one of them had an enormous amount of minerals,

821
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:53,500
particularly natural lithium, which is not a drug, it's really a trace mineral, in the

822
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:58,580
water compared to the adjacent county that had none in the water. And of course, it was

823
01:13:58,580 --> 01:14:02,380
like night and day. The county that had lots of natural lithium in the drinking water,

824
01:14:02,380 --> 01:14:06,740
the amount of domestic violence, violent crime, rapes, murders, suicides, all that kind of

825
01:14:06,740 --> 01:14:11,660
stuff was nearly like 10% of the neighboring county that didn't have any lithium in the

826
01:14:11,660 --> 01:14:12,660
drinking water.

827
01:14:12,660 --> 01:14:17,900
The nice thing about the Healthy Start Pack, or the Alex Pack, is that the Alex Pack has

828
01:14:17,900 --> 01:14:22,020
a significant amount of natural lithium in there, and that's why you and I are such nice

829
01:14:22,020 --> 01:14:28,460
guys. And if everybody in America would take the 90 essential nutrients, they would avoid

830
01:14:28,460 --> 01:14:34,500
the need for all these terrible psychotropic drugs. The combination of bad food, psychotropic

831
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:41,700
drugs, and nutritional deficiencies is an explosive mix. And the medical system has

832
01:14:41,700 --> 01:14:45,820
brought all this together for two reasons. Number one, there's insurance, which allows

833
01:14:45,820 --> 01:14:52,220
them to do whatever they want to do for the money. And then they're a protective monopoly.

834
01:14:52,220 --> 01:14:57,860
The medical system is the only monopoly in America. And so they have no competition.

835
01:14:57,860 --> 01:15:02,020
And so this is where I just really applaud you for bringing this stuff to the surface.

836
01:15:02,020 --> 01:15:05,420
Because without you, Alex, this is not going to get out there. It's a combination of bad

837
01:15:05,420 --> 01:15:10,140
food, psychotropic drugs, and nutritional deficiencies. We solve all that. There won't

838
01:15:10,140 --> 01:15:15,140
be any more of our military people coming back home and committing suicide and being

839
01:15:15,140 --> 01:15:19,780
involved in domestic violence. If we do all this, there won't be another mass murder.

840
01:15:19,780 --> 01:15:24,220
And actually, in the book, Rarest Performing Cures, there's several chapters, four, five,

841
01:15:24,220 --> 01:15:31,060
and six, that deal with serial killers and mass murders. And half of them firebomb churches

842
01:15:31,060 --> 01:15:36,300
by throwing Molotov cocktails. They drive cars through malls and run over people. Half

843
01:15:36,300 --> 01:15:40,500
of them don't even use guns. Guns are not the problem. It's a basic trilogy, I would

844
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:45,260
call it, of bad food, psychotropic drugs, and nutritional deficiencies. And you've hit

845
01:15:45,260 --> 01:15:46,260
the nail on the head once.

846
01:15:46,260 --> 01:15:50,500
Well, you know about the lead conspiracy, which they've proven. I'd love to say guns

847
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:54,900
is what has made crime drop so much since the 70s and 80s. And that has been part of

848
01:15:54,900 --> 01:15:57,740
it. More guns means less crime in the general population.

849
01:15:57,740 --> 01:15:59,300
That is correct.

850
01:15:59,300 --> 01:16:04,900
But the lead was making people mad as a hatter. And they've got direct correlations of lead,

851
01:16:04,900 --> 01:16:09,980
lower IQ, more violent. So you get the lead out of everything, people start becoming less

852
01:16:09,980 --> 01:16:10,980
violent.

853
01:16:10,980 --> 01:16:16,100
You're exactly right. Of course, toxic metals like lead and mercury, the medical system

854
01:16:16,100 --> 01:16:22,860
actually uses mercury as a treatment. And it's just really sort of backwards. And so

855
01:16:22,860 --> 01:16:28,460
this is where you're educating people on these subjects. It's just genius on your part. Because

856
01:16:28,460 --> 01:16:34,460
if we educate America, the average American is a pretty commonsensical person. And they

857
01:16:34,460 --> 01:16:38,060
will find a way to survive. It's that old song, that old country went through the song,

858
01:16:38,060 --> 01:16:44,420
every boy will survive. And people are going to have their guns. If you depend on the government

859
01:16:44,420 --> 01:16:48,540
taking away guns, they're not going to get all the guns away from the bad guys. I like

860
01:16:48,540 --> 01:16:52,740
the idea. I spent almost 20 years in the military, Alex, and the only way to stop a bad guy with

861
01:16:52,740 --> 01:16:59,300
a gun is have a good guy with a gun. And you point out again, when you have the ability

862
01:16:59,300 --> 01:17:04,620
to carry, you have a permit to carry a concealed weapon, everybody gets real nice. They tip

863
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:09,420
their hand to the lazies, they open the doors, because you don't know who's carrying a gun.

864
01:17:09,420 --> 01:17:11,740
And so that's a good thing.

865
01:17:11,740 --> 01:17:16,780
Now I want to shift gears into another area. Again, we have Theo Ratliff here, a retired

866
01:17:16,780 --> 01:17:24,540
basketball player, star, just to get people the idea that minerals, vitamins, trace elements

867
01:17:24,540 --> 01:17:30,100
are more powerful than drugs. They're what were actually designed to use. And it's so

868
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:37,420
much the food we have as adulterated. Shifting gears, Theo, tell folks how you woke up to

869
01:17:37,420 --> 01:17:42,220
this, how you met Dr. Wallach, how it enabled you to stay in the NBA longer, and really

870
01:17:42,220 --> 01:17:43,220
how miraculous.

871
01:17:43,220 --> 01:17:48,420
I mean, this didn't talk, folks, this is true, that the proprietary blends developed by Dr.

872
01:17:48,420 --> 01:17:51,660
Wallach and Young Jebrady were for you, sir.

873
01:17:51,660 --> 01:17:57,500
Well, thanks, Alex, for having me on your show once again. I had a great time last time

874
01:17:57,500 --> 01:18:03,220
we had a chance to speak and, you know, always great to be with the great Dr. Wallach and

875
01:18:03,220 --> 01:18:08,720
all his people over there at Young Jebrady do a great job of just trying to keep people

876
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:11,140
informed and keep people healthy.

877
01:18:11,140 --> 01:18:18,020
My situation was, you know, I was, I've been playing basketball all my life. And I got

878
01:18:18,020 --> 01:18:24,980
to the point where I had made it to the NBA, doing a great job, taking care of my body,

879
01:18:24,980 --> 01:18:30,740
doing all the necessary things, taking the drugs they give me, the supplement, different

880
01:18:30,740 --> 01:18:35,300
things, and was at a stellar career.

881
01:18:35,300 --> 01:18:41,540
Got to the point where I got all the way to being an All-Star. And as I became an All-Star,

882
01:18:41,540 --> 01:18:49,220
I started breaking things just out of the blue. I broke my hand, had a knee fracture,

883
01:18:49,220 --> 01:18:55,080
had a hip fracture, and all these things was going on. And I tried to condition myself

884
01:18:55,080 --> 01:19:01,020
that bleep, bleep, discipline, no drinking alcohol, taking the right supplements, but

885
01:19:01,020 --> 01:19:08,300
it wasn't the wrong supplements, turned out, and just try to stay focused on my craft as

886
01:19:08,300 --> 01:19:14,180
far as being an NBA player and trying to be the best that I can be.

887
01:19:14,180 --> 01:19:20,180
Then it turns to once I broke my hip, had to go into surgery, felt that my career was

888
01:19:20,180 --> 01:19:25,060
about to be over with because it was hard because I had a labrum tear in my hip and

889
01:19:25,060 --> 01:19:35,340
had congenital arthritis in my knees. So just constantly dealing with that and microfracture

890
01:19:35,340 --> 01:19:39,640
and different things that was just thing after thing after thing.

891
01:19:39,640 --> 01:19:45,780
So I had the honor of once I got here with the Hawks here in Atlanta to meet with the

892
01:19:45,780 --> 01:19:53,340
great Mike Glenn, the Stinger, and the great and late Phil Oliver that introduced me to

893
01:19:53,340 --> 01:20:00,700
Dr. Wylie. And they spoke to me about the mental deficiencies that athletes have and

894
01:20:00,700 --> 01:20:05,100
what I was going through. And the light turned on, the light bulb turned on in my head. It

895
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:11,120
was like, wow, I've been doing all this stuff and having the best doctors and no one has

896
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:18,180
ever told me about minerals and how minerals work within your body and athletes and how

897
01:20:18,180 --> 01:20:24,020
we sweat out our memories, not just salt, but all 90 nutrients that we put into our

898
01:20:24,020 --> 01:20:25,520
body, we sweat them out.

899
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:31,660
And as you deplete them, your body started deteriorating. So you become a lot older as

900
01:20:31,660 --> 01:20:36,620
the more and more you play the game. And that's why you see a lot of people once they retire

901
01:20:36,620 --> 01:20:42,660
not walking with the canes, knees back, hip replacements, blase, blase, go on and on.

902
01:20:42,660 --> 01:20:51,780
So with me being able to get with Phil, Dr. Wylie, and the Stinger, I got on the 90 nutrients,

903
01:20:51,780 --> 01:20:59,460
great program, built my body up, got back to my old self, led the league three years

904
01:20:59,460 --> 01:21:05,460
in a row after I came back and shot blocked, was up for the defensive player of the year.

905
01:21:05,460 --> 01:21:12,540
Two of those years went on to have a stellar career, went on to go in and sign another

906
01:21:12,540 --> 01:21:22,540
$40 million contract. And it was just a blessing, a blessing to basically receive what Dr. Wylie

907
01:21:22,540 --> 01:21:27,900
has prepared within Young's equity in the minerals and also having an opportunity to

908
01:21:27,900 --> 01:21:35,660
formulate an energy drink because I did so well, reformulated the rebound FX energy drink

909
01:21:35,660 --> 01:21:40,980
so I can sustain my energy throughout the game when the guys in the fourth quarter are

910
01:21:40,980 --> 01:21:43,540
dwelling down and their energy is going away.

911
01:21:43,540 --> 01:21:49,620
I'm still at my highest level. And guys, up until this day, until I stopped playing, always

912
01:21:49,620 --> 01:21:55,540
asked, man, you out here 38 years old, how you still running out here with these 20 year

913
01:21:55,540 --> 01:22:01,740
olds? And I tell them every time I take my minerals, I take my supplements, my 90 nutrients

914
01:22:01,740 --> 01:22:05,180
every day, and I'm running on this rebound.

915
01:22:05,180 --> 01:22:09,700
How many of the players have listened to you? Because I've noticed that, and this is real,

916
01:22:09,700 --> 01:22:15,100
this really works. They've done studies with rats decades ago where they know if it's a

917
01:22:15,100 --> 01:22:20,300
super high level, a full spectrum of vitamins, minerals, and trace elements that the rats

918
01:22:20,300 --> 01:22:26,540
live twice as long. In some studies, worms have lived four to five times longer. Anybody

919
01:22:26,540 --> 01:22:27,660
can pull those studies up.

920
01:22:27,660 --> 01:22:32,740
I mean, the system knows this and they know that all these different degenerative diseases

921
01:22:32,740 --> 01:22:36,540
are connected to this. They know that all these new diseases that are happening that

922
01:22:36,540 --> 01:22:42,380
they make up the system. Dr. Wallach, how many doctors out there know this or how many

923
01:22:42,380 --> 01:22:46,980
are just ignorant? Because I was reading about basketball players die so young, doctors die

924
01:22:46,980 --> 01:22:51,180
so young. I guess a lot of them just actually don't know this.

925
01:22:51,180 --> 01:22:57,220
Well they have access to the information Alex, and the problem is they get taught to use

926
01:22:57,220 --> 01:23:00,740
the insurance system. The insurance is probably the worst possible thing for the American

927
01:23:00,740 --> 01:23:06,860
public when it comes to health because there's no law or ethical canon that requires the

928
01:23:06,860 --> 01:23:11,380
medical doctor to cure you if there's a cure available. And so they don't. What they do

929
01:23:11,380 --> 01:23:17,060
is they figure out the best way to get every penny of your insurance money. If they, for

930
01:23:17,060 --> 01:23:20,460
instance, rheumatoid arthritis, if they cure you, they're going to make $300 in office

931
01:23:20,460 --> 01:23:24,140
calls. I can cure rheumatoid arthritis in two weeks. And that sounds bizarre, but it's

932
01:23:24,140 --> 01:23:28,380
an infection with antibiotics. You can kill the bug. It'll take 90 days to rebuild the

933
01:23:28,380 --> 01:23:32,820
damage from rheumatoid arthritis, and it's that simple. But a doctor doesn't have to

934
01:23:32,820 --> 01:23:36,580
do that, even though the cure is available by killing that bug, the mycoplasma bug that

935
01:23:36,580 --> 01:23:40,900
caused the rheumatoid arthritis. They choose to do joint replacements. They use methotrexate,

936
01:23:40,900 --> 01:23:47,500
gold shot injections, and they run up a bill over 25 years of $750,000 versus $300,000.

937
01:23:47,500 --> 01:23:50,500
Well it's well known that, I mean, not just what you develop, but I worked for a large

938
01:23:50,500 --> 01:23:55,260
animal vet off and on in high school. And when winter was coming up, they'd say, now

939
01:23:55,260 --> 01:23:59,900
put them on this mineral mix so you don't lose cattle in the cold weather. You just

940
01:23:59,900 --> 01:24:03,900
give them more of the minerals, I forget which ones they were, and the cows wouldn't freeze

941
01:24:03,900 --> 01:24:10,300
to death. What are those minerals? Well, it'd be selenium is the primary one. And of course

942
01:24:10,300 --> 01:24:14,900
you're looking at calcium is another good one. Magnesium is another good one. And those

943
01:24:14,900 --> 01:24:16,540
would be the three big ones for livestock.

944
01:24:16,540 --> 01:24:21,420
Well see, vets know this because their job is actually to deliver food, beef, and things

945
01:24:21,420 --> 01:24:26,900
to the market and not have it die, not bankrupt the industry. So that's why you get real medicine

946
01:24:26,900 --> 01:24:31,100
there. Theo, I asked you a question and then interrupted going to Dr. Wallach. I mean,

947
01:24:31,100 --> 01:24:34,840
how many people in the NBA around you, where you were about to have to retire, saw you

948
01:24:34,840 --> 01:24:39,440
get what, almost 11 years more because of the minerals? I mean, I would think it would

949
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:41,820
just sweep the entire industry.

950
01:24:41,820 --> 01:24:48,620
Well that's the problem. I mean, you can tell the story, but you know who control those

951
01:24:48,620 --> 01:24:55,580
guys are the trainers and the doctors. So like I said, I had the best of the doctors

952
01:24:55,580 --> 01:25:02,260
and the best of the trainers, but they have their own way of doing things, their own mechanism

953
01:25:02,260 --> 01:25:07,300
and which how they give supplements and who they listen to.

954
01:25:07,300 --> 01:25:11,300
Some of them do listen, but some of them won't take that leap of faith.

955
01:25:11,300 --> 01:25:16,980
Well what's incredible is Ted Anderson, the owner of the Genesis Network we're on, a couple

956
01:25:16,980 --> 01:25:20,740
of years ago we start promoting the longevity adds good products. It was just a side issue.

957
01:25:20,740 --> 01:25:26,020
Okay, great. You know, vitamins, minerals. I knew it was true. But Ted then went and

958
01:25:26,020 --> 01:25:30,740
he was going to have knee surgery, went to three doctors and he finally got all the products,

959
01:25:30,740 --> 01:25:36,100
the osteo FX, the beyond tangy tangerine, the essential fatty acids, all of it.

960
01:25:36,100 --> 01:25:40,340
And his knees totally better. What happened there, Dr. Wallett?

961
01:25:40,340 --> 01:25:44,420
Well, actually when you look at that, but we can actually regrow cartilage. The medical

962
01:25:44,420 --> 01:25:48,620
system says you cannot regrow cartilage if you have bone to bone arthritis. You're the

963
01:25:48,620 --> 01:25:53,340
perfect candidate for knee replacement, hip replacement, shoulder replacement, when in

964
01:25:53,340 --> 01:25:56,700
fact you can regrow cartilage. It's very simple. You give it the body, the right nutrition,

965
01:25:56,700 --> 01:26:02,920
the body will rebuild itself. We're constructed to do that. And so what I did, I took everything

966
01:26:02,920 --> 01:26:08,140
I learned from the veterinary industry where we don't have insurance. There's no incentive

967
01:26:08,140 --> 01:26:12,180
for a veterinarian to treat you any longer, treat your livestock any longer than he has

968
01:26:12,180 --> 01:26:17,300
to, because you'll figure out a way to do it yourself if, you know, he starts dragging

969
01:26:17,300 --> 01:26:23,660
it out and obviously using it for an ATM machine. Or in the human health industry, there's insurance

970
01:26:23,660 --> 01:26:27,140
either through the government or private. And so the medical doctors try to get every

971
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:30,740
penny in your insurance policy and they don't feel they're hurting you because insurance

972
01:26:30,740 --> 01:26:33,060
pays is the way they say. This doesn't hurt the patient.

973
01:26:33,060 --> 01:26:37,980
Listen, I know multiple women, I'll just leave it at that, who were not even that old and

974
01:26:37,980 --> 01:26:42,960
had their hair falling out. That's an epidemic now. And one of them even had a thyroid problem

975
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:46,860
and began taking beyond tangy tangerine, the other products at Infowars Health and their

976
01:26:46,860 --> 01:26:52,500
hair came back. I mean, you know, Wallach, Doc, why are women's hair falling out all

977
01:26:52,500 --> 01:26:53,500
over the place?

978
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:58,080
Well, their thyroid gland requires all 90 essential nutrients. The medical doctors want

979
01:26:58,080 --> 01:27:02,780
you to believe that all you need is iodine to make your thyroid healthy. And of course,

980
01:27:02,780 --> 01:27:08,140
low thyroid issues can cause loss of hair. But there's a bigger problem with gluten intolerance,

981
01:27:08,140 --> 01:27:11,980
which results oftentimes in low thyroid, because you can't absorb nutrients when you have a

982
01:27:11,980 --> 01:27:21,380
gluten intolerance. And according to Mayo Clinic, a 2009 study, 30%, 100 million Americans

983
01:27:21,380 --> 01:27:25,740
are gluten intolerant. And this is why people are losing their hair, they're getting 14

984
01:27:25,740 --> 01:27:29,420
diseases they didn't have before, because they're all nutritional deficiencies, including

985
01:27:29,420 --> 01:27:35,060
obesity, diabetes, fibromyalgia, which they call it lupus, which they call a autoimmune

986
01:27:35,060 --> 01:27:40,420
disease, it's nonsense. This is all a gluten intolerance. And then you can't absorb your

987
01:27:40,420 --> 01:27:44,300
nutrients and so you wind up with all these nutritional deficiencies diseases.

988
01:27:44,300 --> 01:27:49,220
Absolutely. And folks, I am plugging this and we do fund the Infowar to defend the Second

989
01:27:49,220 --> 01:27:53,540
Amendment and property rights and our sovereignty, promoting things I believe in, whether it's

990
01:27:53,540 --> 01:27:58,320
propure water filters that we have discounted at infowarshop.com, or whether it's come and

991
01:27:58,320 --> 01:28:04,220
take it, pro Second Amendment t-shirts. But you've never heard me promote supplements

992
01:28:04,220 --> 01:28:09,460
like this, because I've never run into anything this incredible. And that's why Dr. Wallach

993
01:28:09,460 --> 01:28:14,060
and Young-Jebedee is one of the biggest companies out there in the last 15, 16 years, because

994
01:28:14,060 --> 01:28:16,100
they know what they're doing.

995
01:28:16,100 --> 01:28:20,260
They've got the researchers, they've got the products. If you wanna call and you're a new

999
01:28:45,860 --> 01:28:49,620
And there's great interviews and videos. You see what happened with Aaron Dykes. He actually

1000
01:28:49,620 --> 01:28:54,940
followed the whole program and lost 97 pounds. It looks like a new person. I work 18 hours

1001
01:28:54,940 --> 01:28:59,900
a day and I've never been a pill person and a vitamin person. I do about 20% of what I

1002
01:28:59,900 --> 01:29:02,380
should and I've just had energy increase.

1003
01:29:02,380 --> 01:29:06,740
Unfortunately, it's made me get more aggressive. I'm gonna be honest, the side effect is, it's

1004
01:29:06,740 --> 01:29:10,060
like I'm 20 again and almost have road rage and stuff. So I'm gonna be honest with people.

1005
01:29:10,060 --> 01:29:13,940
And I'm gonna come back and talk to Theo about that. What happened with him once he got on

1006
01:29:13,940 --> 01:29:17,980
this stuff? Cuz I feel like I'm 20 again. Problem is when I was 20, I didn't take anything

1007
01:29:17,980 --> 01:29:21,380
off anybody. And I don't know how vitamins and minerals make me more aggressive, they

1008
01:29:21,380 --> 01:29:22,380
just do.

1009
01:29:22,380 --> 01:29:25,260
Dr. Wallach says that doesn't happen with most people, but I'm gonna be honest. Well,

1010
01:29:25,260 --> 01:29:29,260
you've seen the difference last year here on air. And then we're gonna get some more

1011

1046
01:33:17,860 --> 01:33:27,260
NBA multi multi multi time all star Theo Ratliff is our guest. He was able to stay in the NBA

1047
01:33:27,260 --> 01:33:33,620
10 plus years longer, according to his testimony, and it's on record, then he would have been

1048
01:33:33,620 --> 01:33:37,260
able to under traditional vitamins and minerals.

1049
01:33:37,260 --> 01:33:40,560
And I wanted to raise this for you, Theo, because I'm throwing in a lot of questions.

1050
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:46,700
So is Doc Wallach. You've got a lot of knowledge. What do you want to impart to people in your

1051
01:33:46,700 --> 01:33:54,940
testimony? What what were the sports doctors? And nutritionist giving you versus what you

1052
01:33:54,940 --> 01:33:57,940
discovered with Dr Wallach and Young Jeavity.

1053
01:33:57,940 --> 01:34:05,520
Well, there are a lot of the synthetic drugs, you know, the you know, the different pain

1054
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:10,860
killers and the different masking agents, basically, you know, it wasn't anything that

1055
01:34:10,860 --> 01:34:15,800
was helping you to cure your problem. It was only helping to mask the problem and take

1056
01:34:15,800 --> 01:34:20,380
the pain away. So you can go out there, you can play ball, but then you go and sit down.

1057
01:34:20,380 --> 01:34:27,500
You can't walk. So that's not good. So we're with the product, with the Gluco gel and the

1058
01:34:27,500 --> 01:34:34,880
osteo FX and all these different natural products is actually absorbing into your body and helping

1059
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:36,020
to heal your body.

1060
01:34:36,020 --> 01:34:42,740
Like Dr Wallach said, it's healing. It's not just creating a temporary heal. It's creating

1061
01:34:42,740 --> 01:34:47,540
a lifetime here. So you don't have, I don't have any issues. I don't have back issues.

1062
01:34:47,540 --> 01:34:51,460
I don't have any of that stuff right now. Whereas most guys, when they retire, they

1063
01:34:51,460 --> 01:34:56,180
got all kind of different problems going on because they don't have the proper nutrients

1064
01:34:56,180 --> 01:34:57,180
more in their bodies.

1065
01:34:57,180 --> 01:35:03,780
And now I'm having the opportunity to be in front of a lot of the retired guys because

1066
01:35:03,780 --> 01:35:11,420
I'm one of those guys and I'm going to make it my mission to try to explain to guys about

1067
01:35:11,420 --> 01:35:17,660
what this product is and what it's about and how it changed my life and give my testimony

1068
01:35:17,660 --> 01:35:21,860
to them in order to help them in their future.

1069
01:35:21,860 --> 01:35:26,700
Because it's not over with. A lot of people think, okay, just because I got to get this

1070
01:35:26,700 --> 01:35:31,460
knee replacement and I'm on bone on bone that I'm going to have to live with this for the

1071
01:35:31,460 --> 01:35:37,700
rest of my life. But it don't have to be that way. You just have to use the proper things

1072
01:35:37,700 --> 01:35:45,340
in your body to help rebuild that correlation and maintain that bone density and in the

1073
01:35:45,340 --> 01:35:47,700
longevity product is the product that does that.

1074
01:35:47,700 --> 01:35:52,460
By the way, it's not just Dr. Wallach pioneering this and talking about it. Dr. Blalock, who's

1075
01:35:52,460 --> 01:35:56,860
a top retired brain surgeon, he talks about and writes about, and he's got studies that

1076
01:35:56,860 --> 01:36:01,700
are published, many of them and a lot of the terms he's developed like excitotoxin are

1077
01:36:01,700 --> 01:36:04,940
now mainline terms used in the scientific community.

1078
01:36:04,940 --> 01:36:11,540
He says so many problems are just deficiencies and their chronic irritation, inflammation

1079
01:36:11,540 --> 01:36:18,140
from the additives. And we think of fancy drugs as something special, but it's almost

1080
01:36:18,140 --> 01:36:22,860
like white bread in the 40s and 50s. White bread came out, everybody saw it as fancy.

1081
01:36:22,860 --> 01:36:28,500
When it wasn't even bread, it was bleached poison. But it's high tech, it's white bread.

1082
01:36:28,500 --> 01:36:32,680
That's almost what these drugs are like. When meanwhile, the real nutrients, it's what we

1083
01:36:32,680 --> 01:36:38,960
eat. It's what we're designed for. That's what we really need. And the soils are so

1084
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:41,300
depleted that we're just not getting what we need.

1085
01:36:41,300 --> 01:36:46,300
And that was my question for Dr. Wallach. Why did it make me feel, I mean, I was always

1086
01:36:46,300 --> 01:36:49,860
naturally kind of an aggressive guy. I'm angry some of the time and stuff, but I mean, not

1087
01:36:49,860 --> 01:36:55,540
in a bad way. Why would I take beyond tany tangerine, essential fatty acids, and things

1088
01:36:55,540 --> 01:36:57,060
like rebound and stuff?

1089
01:36:57,060 --> 01:37:01,420
Why does it make me bounce off the walls and have so much more energy?

1090
01:37:01,420 --> 01:37:09,300
Well, because your testicles, Alex, God love them, require all 90 essential nutrients to

1091
01:37:09,300 --> 01:37:13,940
make testosterone. So if you're eating four to six eggs a day, you're taking the Alex

1092
01:37:13,940 --> 01:37:18,920
pack twice a day because you're a big guy, you're going to produce enough testosterone

1093
01:37:18,920 --> 01:37:23,540
to make an elephant happy. And so you don't need to do any doping here. You don't need

1094
01:37:23,540 --> 01:37:27,980
to take testosterone patches and all that kind of stuff. You just give your body what

1095
01:37:27,980 --> 01:37:32,380
it needs and you'll make enough testosterone that you will be a man's man. And that's what's

1096
01:37:32,380 --> 01:37:36,540
happening to you. You've noticed that. And this is why the Olympic athletes, we have

1097
01:37:36,540 --> 01:37:44,220
Olympic athletes that have four gold medals. We have one gal, Delicia Jones. She is a woman's

1098
01:37:44,220 --> 01:37:49,660
woman, but women like testosterone too, because that's what gives them libido. When a woman

1099
01:37:49,660 --> 01:37:53,680
goes for menopause, she stops making not only estrogen and progesterone, but she also stops

1100
01:37:53,680 --> 01:37:59,460
making testosterone. And so you get these aggressive women basketball players or football

1101
01:37:59,460 --> 01:38:04,220
players or soccer players and they have lots of testosterone because they're eating four

1102
01:38:04,220 --> 01:38:08,660
to six eggs a day, they're taking the Alex pack twice a day, and they wind up with gold

1103
01:38:08,660 --> 01:38:14,500
medals because they have enough testosterone for muscle strength, for energy, stamina,

1104
01:38:14,500 --> 01:38:18,980
and the proper amount of aggression. Women, if you look at who does the killing in the

1105
01:38:18,980 --> 01:38:25,180
animal world, it's the female lion. The lioness does the killing. The male just sort of lays

1106
01:38:25,180 --> 01:38:30,460
there, looks beautiful. And the female does most of the killing. And so that's the way

1107
01:38:30,460 --> 01:38:35,300
it is with humans too. Women should be very aggressive, but then there's times for them

1108
01:38:35,300 --> 01:38:39,260
to be very feminine and wear long gowns and put on their makeup. And then there's time

1109
01:38:39,260 --> 01:38:43,660
for them to be aggressive, to save their kids. And of course, right now, women aren't supposed

1110
01:38:43,660 --> 01:38:48,680
to be feigning and all domesticated. That's a modern affectation of control. Going back

1111
01:38:48,680 --> 01:38:54,860
to Theo, what did you notice? Go back in the timeframe of when you were breaking down,

1112
01:38:54,860 --> 01:38:56,940
you were gonna have to get out.

1113
01:38:56,940 --> 01:39:00,580
It was about 10 years, right, that the products helped you continue. Describe what happened

1114
01:39:00,580 --> 01:39:05,980
with your focus. I mean, was it just your body or did you experience getting the old

1115
01:39:05,980 --> 01:39:06,980
stamina back?

1116
01:39:06,980 --> 01:39:14,700
Yeah, I mean, a lot of the times, before I started taking the product, if I came home

1117
01:39:14,700 --> 01:39:20,740
from practice, it was immediately, I gotta go take a nap. And just trying to stay up

1118
01:39:20,740 --> 01:39:26,500
and read a book, different things in nature, it was pretty much impossible without me just

1119
01:39:26,500 --> 01:39:29,500
falling asleep while reading.

1120
01:39:29,500 --> 01:39:38,180
But once I started taking the minerals and the rebound effects, everything just became

1121
01:39:38,180 --> 01:39:45,020
clear. It became more clear as far as when I'm reading, understanding, being able to

1122
01:39:45,020 --> 01:39:51,100
maintain your focus. And that's what I liked about it a lot because when you're tired,

1123
01:39:51,100 --> 01:39:52,100
you lose focus.

1124
01:39:52,100 --> 01:39:56,900
And when you're playing in the game, the most critical time in a basketball game is the

1125
01:39:56,900 --> 01:40:03,260
last four or five minutes of the game. And if you look at most NBA games, the teams that

1126
01:40:03,260 --> 01:40:12,060
have that better focus and that better game plan, usually win those games. And if you're

1127
01:40:12,060 --> 01:40:20,020
tired, you're gonna lose that focus, which helps, which attributes to you losing games.

1128
01:40:20,020 --> 01:40:25,140
And that's something that it did for me as far as on the basketball court. Like I said,

1129
01:40:25,140 --> 01:40:31,980
as far as my personal life and being able to focus and concentrate on doing deals and

1130
01:40:31,980 --> 01:40:36,500
being able to sit down, read prospectus and different things of that nature, which people

1131
01:40:36,500 --> 01:40:37,500
consider boring.

1132
01:40:37,500 --> 01:40:44,740
I was able to do it and really focus in on it and help propel my entrepreneurial side

1133
01:40:44,740 --> 01:40:45,740
at the same time.

1134
01:40:45,740 --> 01:40:51,100
That's right, you're involved in a whole bunch of stuff and very successful. I mean, how

1135
01:40:51,100 --> 01:40:54,940
much money does you total make being able to stay in the NBA 10 more years?

1136
01:40:54,940 --> 01:41:06,100
Well, like I said, I signed another $40 million contract, so I hit the lottery again, so to

1137
01:41:06,100 --> 01:41:07,100
speak.

1138
01:41:07,100 --> 01:41:14,380
Well, that's just amazing. And again, the other stories we see, but I mean, Dr. Wallach

1139
01:41:14,380 --> 01:41:19,940
and also Theo, do the sports medicine people not know about this? Or are they so set that

1140
01:41:19,940 --> 01:41:22,220
their thing is right, they won't look at it?

1141
01:41:22,220 --> 01:41:26,660
Or is there an evil motive? Cuz I can't imagine the average doctor, I mean, they're dying

1142
01:41:26,660 --> 01:41:30,020
young too. I mean, I just think they're ignorant most of them.

1143
01:41:30,020 --> 01:41:35,720
Well, I mean, you're talking about people that's going to these high level schools,

1144
01:41:35,720 --> 01:41:42,740
and they're seeing patients every single day. And they did all these different studies on

1145
01:41:42,740 --> 01:41:50,500
what creates, what helps what person that has this disease and that disease.

1146
01:41:50,500 --> 01:41:56,540
So when you're speaking of that, when you don't blow, come off the street. They've never

1147
01:41:56,540 --> 01:42:03,460
been to medical school or anything to be able to come and tell them something that's better

1148
01:42:03,460 --> 01:42:08,740
for their patient. Nine times out of ten, they really not gonna listen.

1149
01:42:08,740 --> 01:42:13,700
Incredible, I think that's absolutely what's happening. Dr. Wallach, your take on that.

1150
01:42:13,700 --> 01:42:18,780
Okay, well, basically, in 14 years of medical school, Alex, the medical doctors do not get

1151
01:42:18,780 --> 01:42:24,380
30 minutes of nutritional training. And so it's not a piece of their language, it's not

1152
01:42:24,380 --> 01:42:29,340
something they recognize as being functional. In their brains, they think if you eat variety

1153
01:42:29,340 --> 01:42:33,740
and put four different colors on your plate, that you're doing okay. They have no earthly

1154
01:42:33,740 --> 01:42:40,060
idea that nutrition can help your body maintain itself. And so when you have a high performance

1155
01:42:40,060 --> 01:42:44,980
athlete or somebody who's doing a lot of physical work, they're looking at you down the line

1156
01:42:44,980 --> 01:42:51,060
as a knee replacement, a hip replacement, a disc surgery in your back, a shoulder surgery.

1157
01:42:51,060 --> 01:42:56,100
And this is what they look at. And so their whole focus is on surgery, surgery, surgery,

1158
01:42:56,100 --> 01:42:57,100
surgery.

1159
01:42:57,100 --> 01:43:01,260
Every little school kid gets taught, I hope they still get taught, your skin goes away

1160
01:43:01,260 --> 01:43:04,820
every 28 days and it replaces itself. But the same thing is true with your cartilage,

1161
01:43:04,820 --> 01:43:08,780
your ligaments, your tendons, your bones, your liver, your kidneys, your heart, your

1162
01:43:08,780 --> 01:43:13,860
lungs, your muscles, skin, everything goes away. And if you don't have the raw materials

1163
01:43:13,860 --> 01:43:18,700
to replace it, then you get disease. And of course, the more high performance you are,

1164
01:43:18,700 --> 01:43:23,100
like an athlete, as Theo pointed out, you're sweating out these nutrients. And so you actually

1165
01:43:23,100 --> 01:43:29,540
break down faster than a librarian. For instance, there's hundreds of librarians every year

1166
01:43:29,540 --> 01:43:35,500
who reach 100 years of age. The average lifespan of a professional athlete in America is 62.

1167
01:43:35,500 --> 01:43:39,260
A football player, the average professional football player in America, lives to be 51.

1168
01:43:39,260 --> 01:43:42,980
With the exception of a couple of black guys in the old Negro baseball league days, there's

1169
01:43:42,980 --> 01:43:47,380
never been a professional athlete ever lived to be 100. The people who you find living

1170
01:43:47,380 --> 01:43:52,620
to be 100 are these little old ladies living out in the swamps Louisiana with no utilities,

1171
01:43:52,620 --> 01:43:58,580
no education, never see a doctor, and they live to be 114. And librarians, they don't

1172
01:43:58,580 --> 01:44:03,500
have knee replacements, and they live to be 100. And they don't exercise. They sit on

1173
01:44:03,500 --> 01:44:07,380
a chair and they work on the computer all day in an air conditioned place. They don't

1174
01:44:07,380 --> 01:44:12,140
sweat. And it's not because of genetics, it's because they don't need as many nutrients

1175
01:44:12,140 --> 01:44:18,580
to maintain themselves as somebody who's a high performance athlete like a guy like Theo.

1176
01:44:18,580 --> 01:44:24,420
Just amazing. And again, it's common sense that you need more minerals and vitamins.

1177
01:44:24,420 --> 01:44:28,100
And it's common sense that if you don't get vitamin C, you get scurvy and your skin rots

1178
01:44:28,100 --> 01:44:33,540
off. I mean, it's common sense, but it's hiding there just in plain view in front of everyone.

1179
01:44:33,540 --> 01:44:39,300
And I can say this more than anything about the longevity products, that the more I take

1180
01:44:39,300 --> 01:44:43,260
of them, the better I feel. I'm trying to habitualize myself like friends and family

1181
01:44:43,260 --> 01:44:46,580
have done to take it all, but I've just never been good at that.

1182
01:44:46,580 --> 01:44:51,340
But I can tell you the big thing is just energy. And it's just been amazing. And I hope listeners

1183
01:44:51,340 --> 01:44:56,780

1188
01:45:20,740 --> 01:45:26,460
Gentlemen, thank you so much for spending time with us today. I'm sorry, I rescheduled

1189
01:45:26,460 --> 01:45:32,260
last week when I had to fly up to New York to be on CNN. And hopefully we can get Theo

1190
01:45:32,260 --> 01:45:37,500
back sometime just to tell some NBA stories. But I'll say this in closing. Theo, a couple

1191
01:45:37,500 --> 01:45:44,220
times when I was out in Hollywood, I got taken to parties and saw a lot of retired NBA players,

1192
01:45:44,220 --> 01:45:45,780
some of them very famous.

1193
01:45:45,780 --> 01:45:49,300
And I noticed that when you see them on ESPN, they're not hobbling with canes. But these

1194
01:45:49,300 --> 01:45:52,900
are guys that weren't even that old and all of them were kind of hobbling and you could

1195
01:45:52,900 --> 01:45:57,220
tell were in pain. And so what you were saying, I didn't know that. They kind of cover that

1196
01:45:57,220 --> 01:46:02,660
up. You're on the inside of this. How many of these guys that are only 45, 50, can't

1197
01:46:02,660 --> 01:46:03,660
even walk?

1198
01:46:03,660 --> 01:46:10,100
There's a lot. I mean, you wouldn't believe the numbers because a lot of guys end up retiring

1199
01:46:10,100 --> 01:46:17,460
early because of an injury. So that injury doesn't rehabilitate themselves just because

1200
01:46:17,460 --> 01:46:23,360
they retire. And they end up, like I said, with the knee replacements, the hip replacements

1201
01:46:23,360 --> 01:46:31,380
and different joint diseases. So that's why it's my mission to go and make sure I at least

1202
01:46:31,380 --> 01:46:35,420
disseminate the information and try to get some of these guys healthy.

1203
01:46:35,420 --> 01:46:40,620
All right, well, thank you so much for spending time with us. And I really appreciate it.

1204
01:46:40,620 --> 01:46:45,900
We look forward to having you guys back on. Find out more about Rebound FX in the liquid

1205
01:46:45,900 --> 01:46:51,620
and the powder available at mfolwarshealth.com. Theo and Dr. Wallach, thank you so much, gentlemen.

1206
01:46:51,620 --> 01:46:54,180
All right. Thank you. Super job.

1207
01:46:54,180 --> 01:46:59,020
Thank you, sir. God bless you. Okay. Again, I had those guys shut up last week. We have

1208
01:46:59,020 --> 01:47:02,680
somebody off from Young Jevity at least once a month. I really believe in it. And it supports

1209
01:47:02,680 --> 01:47:06,260
the info war. We're not like the government that takes your tax money and then gives it

1210
01:47:06,260 --> 01:47:16,340
to MSNBC or CNN or the governments of Bahrain giving money to folks over at CNN.

1211
01:47:16,340 --> 01:47:21,600
That's come out with Amber Lyon. All of that. We're gonna open the phones up in the third

1212
01:47:21,600 --> 01:47:29,020
hour. I'm gonna be honest with you. I am so shell shocked by the Second Amendment stuff

1213
01:47:29,020 --> 01:47:34,000
happening and all coming true, nightmare coming true that I was glad we had that health interview

1214
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:35,000
shut up.

1215
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:39,020
Normally, I would have just canceled it again because the news is so serious. I was glad

1216
01:47:39,020 --> 01:47:45,660
to become distracted with something I can do like go jog or take a vitamin drink or

1217
01:47:45,660 --> 01:47:51,900
something and try to help people because I am just completely freaked out. And I know

1218
01:47:51,900 --> 01:47:55,380
you're freaked out too.

1219
01:47:55,380 --> 01:47:58,140
It's just that sinking feeling. It's like I told you three months ago, I said I got

1220
01:47:58,140 --> 01:48:01,780
a bad feeling and I've never had one like this. And of course, it's intellectual too

1221
01:48:01,780 --> 01:48:05,820
with all the political information I had. I've been all over the map with you guys with

1222
01:48:05,820 --> 01:48:07,420
the clips of what's coming up next.

1223
01:48:07,420 --> 01:48:12,080
We're gonna come back from break and play a very important report Aaron Dykes did that's

1224
01:48:12,080 --> 01:48:16,860
just unbelievably important. Sheriff says teachers should be armed. Second Amendment

1225
01:48:16,860 --> 01:48:20,380
shall not be infringed. We're gonna play that but right now before we go to break cuz it

1226
01:48:20,380 --> 01:48:23,140
ties into the sheriff saying the same thing basically.

1227
01:48:23,140 --> 01:48:33,600
Here's Judge Head over one of the big West Texas towns. Lubbock, this is before the election

1228
01:48:33,600 --> 01:48:40,600
saying look, they're gonna try gun confiscation. There's gonna be a 1776 and I need more deputies

1229
01:48:40,600 --> 01:48:42,180
to get ready for this.

1230
01:48:42,180 --> 01:48:45,820
We're not gonna turn the guns in and then suddenly there's sheriffs and police chiefs

1231
01:48:45,820 --> 01:48:50,300
all over the country and city councils who are now moving in this direction. In fact,

1232
01:48:50,300 --> 01:48:54,540
so many of these are coming in. I can't even keep track of them right now. And you watch

1233
01:48:54,540 --> 01:48:57,260
the sheriff and he starts to cry.

1234
01:48:57,260 --> 01:49:01,940
You can hear him cuz he realizes what he's committing to. It's the sadness. He says I'm

1235
01:49:01,940 --> 01:49:11,980
so sad. It's not a fear of Obama. It's very sad. And that's the sound I feel like I should

1236
01:49:11,980 --> 01:49:18,140
make just. Man, they're gonna take everything. The fact they're going after the guns that

1237
01:49:18,140 --> 01:49:21,620
means they mean business.

1238
01:49:21,620 --> 01:49:25,300
It's time to pray. I'm gonna tell you right now because listen, they're gonna push till

1239
01:49:25,300 --> 01:49:31,280
you resist. They want you to resist. There's no way out of this. You understand that? There's

1240
01:49:31,280 --> 01:49:39,180
no way out. The only hope we've got is breaking the trance, breaking the spell, getting angry.

1241
01:49:39,180 --> 01:49:42,820
Now here's Judge Head. We come back, I'll play the other sheriff and others that are

1242
01:49:42,820 --> 01:49:43,820
coming out.

1243
01:49:43,820 --> 01:49:48,100
And I was watching this clip last night. I watched this morning, this sheriff. And you

1244
01:49:48,100 --> 01:49:52,060
can hear him getting chills. You hear him when he's talking and go, and it's not fear.

1245
01:49:52,060 --> 01:49:57,100
It's man, because everybody knows in their gut. That's why everybody's out buying 10

1246
01:49:57,100 --> 01:50:01,820
million guns a month right now. But you hear the, let's go to Judge Head. Here it is.

1247
01:50:01,820 --> 01:50:06,880
He is gonna try to hand over the sovereignty of the United States to the UN. Okay, what's

1248
01:50:06,880 --> 01:50:10,140
gonna happen when that happens? I'm thinking worst case scenario.

1249
01:50:10,140 --> 01:50:11,140
Right, right.

1250
01:50:11,140 --> 01:50:17,020
Civil unrest, civil disobedience, civil war, maybe. And we're not talking just a few riots

1251
01:50:17,020 --> 01:50:23,940
here and demonstrations. We're talking Lexington, Concord, take up arms and get rid of the guy.

1252
01:50:23,940 --> 01:50:28,620
Okay, now what's gonna happen if we do that? If the public decides to do that? He's gonna

1253
01:50:28,620 --> 01:50:34,820
send in UN troops. I don't want them in Lubbock County. Okay, so I'm gonna stand in front

1254
01:50:34,820 --> 01:50:39,300
of their armored personnel carriers and say, you're not coming in here. And the sheriff,

1255
01:50:39,300 --> 01:50:42,300
I've already asked him, I said, you're gonna back me? He said, yeah, I'll back you. Well,

1256
01:50:42,300 --> 01:50:43,860
I don't want a bunch of rookies back there.

1257
01:50:43,860 --> 01:50:44,860
All right.

1258
01:50:44,860 --> 01:50:45,860
True.

1259
01:50:45,860 --> 01:50:46,860
I want trained.

1260
01:50:46,860 --> 01:50:50,420
Full clip is up at infowars.com, so they're having to get ready. People say that guy's

1261
01:50:50,420 --> 01:50:54,060
crazy and never happened. No, that's the guy who knows what's going on. That's an American

1262
01:50:54,060 --> 01:50:58,980
right there. You either capitulate to the globalist and say, I give up, occupy us, carry

1263
01:50:58,980 --> 01:51:01,220
on a Gena 21 or resist.

1264
01:51:01,220 --> 01:51:07,220
Hey there, Frank Bates here. Have you heard about the weird device that could wipe out

1265
01:51:07,220 --> 01:51:13,300
280 million Americans? This is really scary stuff. Defense experts warn that this odd

1266
01:51:13,300 --> 01:51:18,580
device poses the gravest threat we've ever known. In fact, just a few weeks ago, former

1267
01:51:18,580 --> 01:51:22,660
speaker of the house Newt Gingrich wrote an op-ed piece for the Washington Post warning

1268
01:51:22,660 --> 01:51:27,500
about this deadly threat. I can't believe that more people aren't talking about this.

1269
01:51:27,500 --> 01:51:32,200
It may be because the liberals and the government are trying to cover it up. That's why my friend

1270
01:51:32,200 --> 01:51:38,300
just created a free video at weirddevice.com that exposes this threat and blows the doors

1271
01:51:38,300 --> 01:51:43,980
off the conspiracy. Go watch the shocking video at weirddevice.com right now to discover

1272
01:51:43,980 --> 01:51:49,180
exactly what it is, plus discover the number one way you and your family can survive this

1273
01:51:49,180 --> 01:51:54,420
deadly attack. I'm not sure how long this video will be online, so go to weirddevice.com

1274

before it's gone forever. Again, that's weirddevice.com.

1275
01:51:58,060 --> 01:52:07,280
You land in Buenos Aires, then a shuttle to Santa Rosa, where a nicely furnished cabin

1295
01:53:58,900 --> 01:54:12,540
My friends, do you want to be conquered? You want to be run by fire and ruthless, eugenicist

1296
01:54:12,540 --> 01:54:18,180
based banks who've wrecked every other country they dominate as a tool of control? Well,

1297
01:54:18,180 --> 01:54:22,820
you're going to get what you want. Everybody else better get real aggressive. Just like

1298
01:54:22,820 --> 01:54:28,620
I said a couple months ago when I said 1776, part two, we got to get politically aggressive.

1299
01:54:28,620 --> 01:54:34,060
We got to move for secession because the federal government's been taken over. Succede to re-upload

1300
01:54:34,060 --> 01:54:39,500
the republic, not to get rid of the republic. They're going to act like Obama used the George

1301
01:54:39,500 --> 01:54:45,940
Washington rolled into Lincoln and is there to save us.

1302
01:54:45,940 --> 01:54:49,300
That's how they're billing him and now they're officially saying that. He's going to take

1303
01:54:49,300 --> 01:54:53,860
your guns. Lincoln was a dictator. Obama can do it. That's the sales pitch and they're

1304
01:54:53,860 --> 01:54:57,760
trying to see if he can get away with it right now. They want to take this country over right

1305
01:54:57,760 --> 01:55:03,380
now. This is the biggest news since 1776. What's happening right now? They're going

1306
01:55:03,380 --> 01:55:04,380
for broke, okay?

1307
01:55:04,380 --> 01:55:07,820
Let's go ahead and go to Aaron Dykes special report on this. Here it is.

1308
01:55:07,820 --> 01:55:12,780
Aaron Dykes for infowars.com. Now we've already seen a big pushback against the system's gun

1309
01:55:12,780 --> 01:55:17,340
control agenda. Now we're hearing from Rahm Emanuel that if you're not in law enforcement,

1310
01:55:17,340 --> 01:55:21,500
if you're not a police officer, you need to shut your mouth and not weigh in on the Second

1311
01:55:21,500 --> 01:55:22,500
Amendment.

1312
01:55:22,500 --> 01:55:26,860
Put the police chief in the law enforcement community front and center. Everybody else

1313
01:55:26,860 --> 01:55:31,500
from politician to whatever, take a back seat because the police chiefs have a credibility

1314
01:55:31,500 --> 01:55:33,300
and authority and a voice on this.

1315
01:55:33,300 --> 01:55:36,660
First of all, we're not going to give up our First Amendment as you try to destroy the

1316
01:55:36,660 --> 01:55:40,340
Second Amendment. We will never give up our First Amendment. We will never give up our

1317
01:55:40,340 --> 01:55:44,740
Second Amendment. They're inalienable rights. They are not to be infringed. We're not going

1318
01:55:44,740 --> 01:55:49,380
to be lectured to by the mayor of the murder capital of the world, Chicago, as you try

1319
01:55:49,380 --> 01:55:54,140
to get these insane policies passed all around the country. But second of all, you haven't

1320
01:55:54,140 --> 01:55:58,300
been listening to law enforcement who've been speaking up across the country saying we will

1321
01:55:58,300 --> 01:55:59,460
not infringe.

1322
01:55:59,460 --> 01:56:03,960
We will not enforce any unconstitutional gun laws. We heard a week and a half, two weeks

1323
01:56:03,960 --> 01:56:08,340
ago from the Pennsylvania police chief of the small town who's introducing a Second

1324
01:56:08,340 --> 01:56:12,340
Amendment defense ordinance to protect and keep the Second Amendment and saying they're

1325
01:56:12,340 --> 01:56:17,860
going to nullify any laws which are unconstitutional and otherwise trying to infringe. We've seen

1326
01:56:17,860 --> 01:56:23,100
Wyoming lawmakers and others trying to introduce legislation upholding the Second Amendment

1327
01:56:23,100 --> 01:56:27,340
and reminding and sending the message back to Washington that they too will not be in

1328
01:56:27,340 --> 01:56:30,780
part of infringing on the Second Amendment.

1329
01:56:30,780 --> 01:56:35,900
And that's really what we need. We need people recognizing their legal jurisdiction at the

1330
01:56:35,900 --> 01:56:40,700
state, local and county level and saying no, we're not going to cooperate with the feds.

1331
01:56:40,700 --> 01:56:45,500
We will not participate in destroying our God given and guaranteed rights. Now we're

1332
01:56:45,500 --> 01:56:50,880
hearing from Sheriff Denny Payman of Jackson County, Kentucky. He too is saying he will

1333
01:56:50,880 --> 01:56:55,480
not enforce federal gun grabbing laws. He's standing up for his oath. He's recognizing

1334
01:56:55,480 --> 01:57:01,420
the fact that he is the highest law enforcement officer in his jurisdiction at the county

1335
01:57:01,420 --> 01:57:06,520
level and that even the feds do not have higher jurisdiction there and cannot tell him what

1336
01:57:06,520 --> 01:57:07,520
to do.

1337
01:57:07,520 --> 01:57:12,580
If Obama passes this, it doesn't matter what he passes. The sheriff has more power than

1338
01:57:12,580 --> 01:57:17,660
the federal people. They need to go back and they study that. We're a commonwealth. I can

1339
01:57:17,660 --> 01:57:21,180
ask the federal people to leave. They have to leave. I can ask state people to leave.

1340
01:57:21,180 --> 01:57:22,180
They have to leave.

1341
01:57:22,180 --> 01:57:27,200
And he's being asked by journalists how he's going to participate in confiscating guns

1342
01:57:27,200 --> 01:57:28,200
that dangerous task.

1343
01:57:28,200 --> 01:57:32,540
You're never going to pull a gun from Jackson County. I can't get their equipment to help

1344
01:57:32,540 --> 01:57:36,540
those people. My best help to them is to let them keep their firearm. I can't do it for

1345
01:57:36,540 --> 01:57:41,020
the other counties. I can't stand up for them, but I can't stand up for my people. And you

1346
01:57:41,020 --> 01:57:44,060
know, I was one of the first people to say, I think they need to arm school teachers.

1347
01:57:44,060 --> 01:57:48,040
Not all of them, but they need, there's somebody that needs to have a weapon.

1348
01:57:48,040 --> 01:57:52,020
And it's so clear what's going on that this sheriff is saying the founding fathers will

1349
01:57:52,020 --> 01:57:53,980
be turning over in their graves.

1350
01:57:53,980 --> 01:57:57,980
Second amendment, they said very clear and our forefathers made that very clear. Otherwise

1351
01:57:57,980 --> 01:58:01,980
they would have been so high on the amendment. It would have been down the list someplace

1352
01:58:01,980 --> 01:58:07,980
to me. And I would be ashamed if one of them was in this room right now and having to listen

1353
01:58:07,980 --> 01:58:12,300
to what we're having to talk about. I would be ashamed to have them sit here and listen

1354
01:58:12,300 --> 01:58:18,540
to all the people that have given their lives for this right for us. And we just give it

1355
01:58:18,540 --> 01:58:21,360
up so flippantly just because somebody says so.

1356
01:58:21,360 --> 01:58:26,140
First of all, you shouldn't want to participate in destroying the things that make this country

1357
01:58:26,140 --> 01:58:29,580
great. Our country was different. That's why the bill of rights and the constitution gave

1358
01:58:29,580 --> 01:58:35,700
us the quote 5,000 year leap. Second of all, this whole time, that full report is up at

1371
02:00:31,420 --> 02:00:37,780
We are now into our number three. I am calling for the states. I'm calling for members of

1372
02:00:37,780 --> 02:00:45,540
Congress, everybody to circulate their own bill of particulars dealing with the crimes

1373
02:00:45,540 --> 02:00:56,060
of this administration and impeachable offenses. We need to issue a petition for the executive

1374
02:00:56,060 --> 02:01:00,940
wannabe dictator to be impeached.

1375
02:01:00,940 --> 02:01:08,820
Let's not talk about starting impeachment proceedings. We need to list the bill of impeachment.

1376
02:01:08,820 --> 02:01:12,860
That's what we'll call it at mfullawards.com with our points in case people don't know

1377
02:01:12,860 --> 02:01:18,220
all the stuff this president's done. I was sitting here thinking during the last few

1378
02:01:18,220 --> 02:01:27,380
hours during the breaks about all the different things, all the different things that Obama

1379
02:01:27,380 --> 02:01:31,940
has done that are completely unconstitutional.

1380
02:01:31,940 --> 02:01:36,180
The secret orders on cyber security and telling Congress they can't see him. Saying our troops

1381
02:01:36,180 --> 02:01:43,060
are under UN control and that Congress has no authority over that. Now saying you'll

1382
02:01:43,060 --> 02:01:48,660
sign executive orders on guns, lying to Congress, fast and furious. Congress not doing anything

1383
02:01:48,660 --> 02:01:54,140
about it. I know Congress is bad, but it's their job to impeach this guy. Do it, start

1384
02:01:54,140 --> 02:01:57,540
it now. This is super creepy.

1385
02:01:57,540 --> 02:02:02,580
You've got an armed to the teeth, crazy government, working for a bunch of foreign banks, training

1386
02:02:02,580 --> 02:02:09,660
at all these military drills to kill role players and John Deere hats and overalls.

1387
02:02:09,660 --> 02:02:12,900
And they practice killing grandpa, folks. I've been to the drills, I've shot video,

1388
02:02:12,900 --> 02:02:17,860
you've seen them. Troops have called in, yeah, no, we practice killing rural people. They

1389
02:02:17,860 --> 02:02:22,500
practice killing my granddaddy. They practice killing old men on tractors.

1390
02:02:22,500 --> 02:02:26,660
They know who isn't gonna go along with this. There's not many Americans left, I guess.

1391
02:02:26,660 --> 02:02:32,180
Go wipe out old country people. Bunch of sick traders, man, I cannot believe we've gotten

1392
02:02:32,180 --> 02:02:41,020
this low in this country. And I mean, is there nothing we won't put up with? Secret arrest,

1393
02:02:41,020 --> 02:02:44,660
warrantless wiretapping, torture, the government, we're running Al-Qaeda.

1394
02:02:44,660 --> 02:02:48,960
That's another thing, I wanna start impeachment over the Libya and Syria attacks when Congress

1395
02:02:48,960 --> 02:02:53,340
said don't do it and the president did it. And then impeachment for our government giving

1396
02:02:53,340 --> 02:03:01,820
weapons to Al-Qaeda, that's the big one. Now arming Al-Qaeda, arming Al-Qaeda. Let's go,

1397
02:03:01,820 --> 02:03:02,820
let's go.

1398
02:03:02,820 --> 02:03:09,900
Look, I don't like to get up here and say 1776 part two, states secede to get rid of

1399
02:03:09,900 --> 02:03:14,780
the federal government and then re-upload it. A novel approach to what's constitutional,

1400
02:03:14,780 --> 02:03:20,540
I've had constitutional scholars on to agree with my analysis. I told you months ago, people

1401
02:03:20,540 --> 02:03:22,300
are like, why are you calling for his impeachment now?

1402
02:03:22,300 --> 02:03:26,380
Why are you calling for 1776? Because they were saying what they were gonna do. And then

1403
02:03:26,380 --> 02:03:34,960
right on time, the enabling crisis comes and it smells to high heaven. So when we come

1404
02:03:34,960 --> 02:03:42,220
back, we're gonna be taking your phone calls here today. Specifically on what do you think

1405
02:03:42,220 --> 02:03:44,740
you should be impeached for? Or do you disagree with me?

1406
02:03:44,740 --> 02:03:48,820
And there's so many things that are impeachable. I'm thinking of new ones every few minutes.

1407
02:03:48,820 --> 02:03:55,580
So you call in with what we should call it. I mean, the Bill of Particulars, the Bill

1408
02:03:55,580 --> 02:03:59,700
of Impeachment for Barack Hussein Obama, that's what it's called, starts in the House. They

1409
02:03:59,700 --> 02:04:06,180
vote to then have a trial in the Senate. I mean, it's time to go after Obama. He's their

1410
02:04:06,180 --> 02:04:09,460
front man, he's their puppet, but he's the usurper.

1411
02:04:09,460 --> 02:04:14,620
And look, I'm not some macho guy looking for trouble, but I'm not gonna be a slave. And

1412
02:04:14,620 --> 02:04:23,940
I know what's going on. 800-259-9231 on this issue of treason, the executive orders. And

1413
02:04:23,940 --> 02:04:27,380
they're playing this game of, yeah, I can do an executive order. I can't take everything

1414
02:04:27,380 --> 02:04:29,360
with executive order, but I can take some stuff.

1415
02:04:29,360 --> 02:04:35,260
You can't take anything. The Congress can't even pass a law to take our guns, folks, because

1416
02:04:35,260 --> 02:04:43,740
it is unalienable. You cannot put a lien on it, inalienable. The Bill of Rights points

1417
02:04:43,740 --> 02:04:48,540
out what's already there organically. I am not your slave. You are not getting my guns.

1418
02:04:48,540 --> 02:04:54,340
And it's not the obsession over the guns, okay? My guns aren't even locked and loaded

1419
02:04:54,340 --> 02:04:58,780
except for handguns and stuff for self-defense. It's the bellwether, the canary in the coal

1420
02:04:58,780 --> 02:05:00,780
mine.

1421
02:05:00,780 --> 02:05:04,860

you get sick and die? Start purifying your water with ProPure. My friends, I've done

Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers. The prognosis for the entire planetary

1433
02:06:05,760 --> 02:06:11,460
economic system runs from bad to worse. The globalist model is to shut down societies

1434
02:06:11,460 --> 02:06:16,620
and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover. That's why we've assembled

1443
02:07:00,540 --> 02:07:05,640
Looking back on 2012 we ask ourselves how did we ever survive from natural disasters

1444
02:07:05,640 --> 02:07:10,220
like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on

1445
02:07:10,220 --> 02:07:15,180
by a disastrous economy. Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything. At eFoods

1446

1447
02:07:19,420 --> 02:07:24,420
by having a supply of food on hand. After Hurricane Sandy Danny from New York City wrote

1448
02:07:24,420 --> 02:07:29,700
almost all the grocery stores are closed but I managed to get my eFoods just in time to

1449
02:07:29,700 --> 02:07:34,500
be able to help my sister and niece. It is better to be prepared 10 years too early than

1450
02:07:34,500 --> 02:07:39,540
one day too late. I can warn you but I can't feed you. Heed the warnings and do what Alex

1454
02:08:21,900 --> 02:08:44,500
From the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones. Well all of you claimed you'd

1455
02:08:44,500 --> 02:08:50,860
fight back if they came to confiscate the guns. Obama thinks you're weak and he thinks

1456
02:08:50,860 --> 02:08:58,260
you're going to turn them in.

1457
02:08:58,260 --> 02:09:01,260
Coming to you from the front lines of the info war and we're trying to keep it an info

1458
02:09:01,260 --> 02:09:07,880
war. Bloomberg is in the news. Those articles are up at Infowars.com saying defy Congress.

1459
02:09:07,880 --> 02:09:14,900
Just take the guns. The legislature has passed in the Senate a outright assault weapons confiscation.

1460
02:09:14,900 --> 02:09:22,500
Here's the Biden headline. Joe Biden. White House eyeing 19 executive actions on guns.

1461
02:09:22,500 --> 02:09:26,780
Executive orders. White House to announce the executive orders tomorrow. They are to

1462
02:09:26,780 --> 02:09:33,980
include assault weapons ban. Ban of magazines that hold more than seven rounds. It's the

1463
02:09:33,980 --> 02:09:40,940
Chicago gun ban. It's the Illinois gun ban. It's the universal background checks and limits

1464
02:09:40,940 --> 02:09:45,460
on the number of bullets magazines can hold. And that's retroactive. They're saying you

1465
02:09:45,460 --> 02:09:48,620
can't, you have to come in and register all your guns because you're not allowed now to

1466
02:09:48,620 --> 02:09:50,420
sell it to your neighbor ever.

1467
02:09:50,420 --> 02:09:56,340
According to sources familiar with the White House, or people working for the White House.

1468
02:09:56,340 --> 02:10:01,860
Iowa lawmaker calls for retroactive gun ban, house to house gun confiscation of all semi-autos.

1469
02:10:01,860 --> 02:10:07,880
CBS News, New York Assembly, Speaker, Silver. We are going to ban assault weapons, all semi-autos

1470
02:10:07,880 --> 02:10:21,260
to be turned in. And the bill has passed the Senate. It's in the legislative session in

1471
02:10:21,260 --> 02:10:25,580
the House. This is just unprecedented. And it says you come in and register them and

1472
02:10:25,580 --> 02:10:27,500
we can take them on the spot if we want.

1473
02:10:27,500 --> 02:10:31,560
That's what Cuomo called for two and a half weeks ago, remember? I mean, they got a plan.

1474
02:10:31,560 --> 02:10:38,120
We know what it is. And then they'll get most the guns in this push, then there'll be more

1475
02:10:38,120 --> 02:10:41,620
mass shootings. And they'll say that's it, just turn them in. And then they know there'll

1476
02:10:41,620 --> 02:10:46,220
be resistance. Let me explain what's happening everybody here, okay?

1477
02:10:46,220 --> 02:10:57,700
The toll free number to join us on air is 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231. And we will get

1478
02:10:57,700 --> 02:11:06,860
you up and on the air today. A foreign criminal banking mafia took over the United States

1479
02:11:06,860 --> 02:11:10,780
with the Federal Reserve with a beachhead in 1913. They used our energy, our power,

1480
02:11:10,780 --> 02:11:14,440
our taxes to dominate most of the world and set up a world government.

1481
02:11:14,440 --> 02:11:18,340
It's European banks, that's why we're merging with the EU basically. Those very same banks

1482
02:11:18,340 --> 02:11:23,020
funded Lenin to get him into power, to get rid of that national sovereignty the Russians

1483
02:11:23,020 --> 02:11:28,940
had. That's now been declassified. The same banks put Mao in to kill over 60 million people,

1484
02:11:28,940 --> 02:11:33,540
some estimates are 80 plus mil, and to bring in that tyranny, that's a deal.

1485
02:11:33,540 --> 02:11:38,140
They set up tyrannies all over the world. They put Muslim extremists in Libya and Syria.

1486
02:11:38,140 --> 02:11:42,980
They're bad, their fruits are bad. They're really vicious. The people running our government

1487
02:11:42,980 --> 02:11:48,940
have put real al-Qaeda in with al-Qaeda flags, al-Qaeda brigades, black uniforms with al-Qaeda

1488
02:11:48,940 --> 02:11:54,260
patches. They are cutting Christians heads off on camera, the news thinks it's great.

1489
02:11:54,260 --> 02:11:58,420
They are making father's suicide bomb or they kill their whole families. They are shooting

1490
02:11:58,420 --> 02:12:06,060
at passenger airliners and blowing them up. And our media is like good, al-Qaeda is good.

1491
02:12:06,060 --> 02:12:10,580
Back of the newspaper, al-Qaeda is doing a great job attacking Assad, who didn't do anything

1492
02:12:10,580 --> 02:12:12,580
to anybody.

1493
02:12:12,580 --> 02:12:17,420
That's how bold and how evil they are, okay? They think you're so dumb, the people running

1494
02:12:17,420 --> 02:12:25,300
our country run al-Qaeda. And that's mainstream news. And even Glenn Beck admits that now,

1495
02:12:25,300 --> 02:12:28,700
but calls me a traitor for saying our government runs al-Qaeda all these years. Why don't I

1496
02:12:28,700 --> 02:12:31,940
get an apology?

1497
02:12:31,940 --> 02:12:38,020
This isn't our government. And they have stolen 1.5 quadrillion in fake derivative money and

1498
02:12:38,020 --> 02:12:41,340
they've signed us onto it. And it's hundreds of times what we could ever pay back. It's

1499
02:12:41,340 --> 02:12:46,020
not our debt. Our real debt's about 16 trillion. And they use that to control us and tell us

1500
02:12:46,020 --> 02:12:49,460
how we're debtors all day from the most wealthy nation in the world to the biggest debtor

1501
02:12:49,460 --> 02:12:51,580
nation in the world in 50 years.

1502
02:12:51,580 --> 02:12:55,220
From the highest test scores to the lowest, from the lowest cancer rate to the highest.

1503
02:12:55,220 --> 02:13:01,340
We are a cursed, overtaken nation of debt slaves. They're now starting forced inoculations

1504
02:13:01,340 --> 02:13:06,780
all over the country of school children outside of parental consent, abortions without parental

1505
02:13:06,780 --> 02:13:10,980
consent. They just do what they want. And it's a felony every time they do it. No one

1506
02:13:10,980 --> 02:13:17,380
will enforce. No attorney general will go after them. No county attorney, no city attorney,

1507
02:13:17,380 --> 02:13:21,220
no one will stand up.

1508
02:13:21,220 --> 02:13:25,940
Now we're starting to see state reps and federal, mainly people in Texas, Kentucky, Wyoming,

1509
02:13:25,940 --> 02:13:30,620
places like that, places that the television demonizes, places the occupier collaborators

1510
02:13:30,620 --> 02:13:36,160
demonize. They're starting to say, look, this is gonna go 1776. We're gonna nullify taking

1511
02:13:36,160 --> 02:13:38,180
guns. Don't come in the state and do this.

1512
02:13:38,180 --> 02:13:42,420
Don't, don't do this. Don't, don't, don't. Cuz everybody knows they, when they come for

1513
02:13:42,420 --> 02:13:47,820
the guns, they're super bold, and they're gonna drop the hammer on 100 different fronts.

1514
02:13:47,820 --> 02:13:53,580
The globalists are all going to go to prison unless they go for it all. The Chicago mafia,

1515
02:13:53,580 --> 02:14:01,020
Emanuel, the DC mafia, the New York mafia, Bloomberg. They are the government mafia.

1516
02:14:01,020 --> 02:14:05,300
They are the federal family. So that's what Janet calls them in letters. You are the federal

1517
02:14:05,300 --> 02:14:12,860
family. The federal cancer, the federal family is taking over. The federal family is gonna

1518
02:14:12,860 --> 02:14:17,460
double your power prices. The federal family is gonna triple your, they do the same thing

1519
02:14:17,460 --> 02:14:20,020
in every other country, okay?

1520
02:14:20,020 --> 02:14:25,120
They have an IMF World Bank 112 point plan. They're gonna implement it, all of it, right

1521
02:14:25,120 --> 02:14:29,940
down the middle. And when you go bankrupt, they're gonna say, we got food stamps for

1522
02:14:29,940 --> 02:14:36,340
you. We got full steps. We got social security. They want you broke. And then they're gonna

1523
02:14:36,340 --> 02:14:40,100
have the conservatives say, make all these people hundreds of millions on welfare work.

1524
02:14:40,100 --> 02:14:43,980
Now you're gonna be in government work brigades. Now you're gonna be government security brigades.

1525
02:14:43,980 --> 02:14:48,020
This is the takeover. This is the collectivization. That's why they're going after farmers. That's

1526
02:14:48,020 --> 02:14:52,020
why they're going after ranchers. That's why they're going after anybody that's self-sufficient.

1527
02:14:52,020 --> 02:14:56,020
That's why they outlawed two years ago cash and secondhand sales in Louisiana. And they're

1528
02:14:56,020 --> 02:15:00,060
actually putting people in jail for using cash. That's why they're surveilling us. That's

1529
02:15:00,060 --> 02:15:01,500
why they're opening the borders.

1530
02:15:01,500 --> 02:15:04,380
That's why they're getting ready to legalize all the illegal aliens, because they're gonna

1531
02:15:04,380 --> 02:15:09,740
break this country. And they know you're not gonna turn your guns in and they're gonna

1532
02:15:09,740 --> 02:15:13,600
pick you off one at a time. And they know some of you are gonna start fighting back

1533
02:15:13,600 --> 02:15:17,380
and you're gonna be called terrorist on the news.

1534
02:15:17,380 --> 02:15:20,920
And as they see patriots getting arrested, as they see police chiefs getting killed that

1535
02:15:20,920 --> 02:15:27,460
don't play ball, as they see federal troops enter legislatures, they are gonna be on the

1536
02:15:27,460 --> 02:15:34,580
news calling us terrorist and calling Obama Abraham Lincoln part two.

1537
02:15:34,580 --> 02:15:39,740
Texas threatens to arrest any feds who try enforcing new gun rags. White House readies

1538
02:15:39,740 --> 02:15:45,060
19 executive orders. Obama to surround himself with children to announce the new gun controls.

1539
02:15:45,060 --> 02:15:49,300
See, it's for the children while he kills kids with the drones. Click on that top article.

1540
02:15:49,300 --> 02:15:57,180
It's also up at mfallwars.com. W-O-A-I, TV and radio, Texas proposal, jail any federal

1541
02:15:57,180 --> 02:16:00,180
officials trying to enforce new gun restrictions in the state.

1542
02:16:00,180 --> 02:16:04,940
And what did the feds say last year when the House voted unanimously to not let the TSA

1543
02:16:04,940 --> 02:16:09,620
grab our genitals and enforce party laws on the books? They said we'll have an armed F-16

1544
02:16:09,620 --> 02:16:14,900
blockade and we will shoot down aircraft entering or flying out of your state. Bring it, come

1545
02:16:14,900 --> 02:16:19,300
on, Obama. You already got Al Qaeda shooting down airlines in Europe or threatening to

1546
02:16:19,300 --> 02:16:21,660
and shooting them down in Middle East.

1547
02:16:21,660 --> 02:16:26,420
Go ahead, do it, you scum. You're an American usurper, you filth. We put that article back

1548
02:16:26,420 --> 02:16:32,420
up there. I mean, it's on. A Texas lawmaker says, I want them on right now, guys, call

1549
02:16:32,420 --> 02:16:36,000
them. A Texas lawmaker says, it's gonna be impossible in an hour. Everybody call that

1550
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:37,420
number right now, get them on.

1551
02:16:37,420 --> 02:16:41,460
A Texas lawmaker says he plans to file the Firearms Protection Act, which would make

1552
02:16:41,460 --> 02:16:46,260
any federal laws that may be passed, yeah, we reported on this yesterday, by Congress

1553
02:16:46,260 --> 02:16:50,620
or imposed by presidential order, which would ban or restrict ownership of semi-automatic

1554
02:16:50,620 --> 02:16:54,940
firearms or the limit the size of the gun magazines illegal in the state.

1555
02:16:54,940 --> 02:17:04,860
WOAI 1200 reports, Republican Representative Steve Toth, good for him, says his measure

1556
02:17:04,860 --> 02:17:09,980
also calls for felony charges to be filed against internal federal official, how about

1557
02:17:09,980 --> 02:17:15,100
servant who tries to enforce the rule in the state. If a federal official comes to the

1558
02:17:15,100 --> 02:17:18,460
state of Texas to enforce the federal executive order, they already have all the states and

1559
02:17:18,460 --> 02:17:21,100
counties on arresting legal aliens, that's constitutional.

1560
02:17:21,100 --> 02:17:27,720
Why can't we do this? See, if a federal official comes into the state of Texas to enforce the

1561
02:17:27,720 --> 02:17:35,620
federal executive order, that person is subject to criminal prosecution. Toth told 1200 WOAI

1562
02:17:35,620 --> 02:17:42,380
Joe Pags, listen to Joe Pags on the morning. I heard Joe Pags say it's okay to pay off

1563
02:17:42,380 --> 02:17:45,620
the police when they want payoffs last week, I couldn't believe it.

1564
02:17:45,620 --> 02:17:50,060
Let's go back to that, let's just go back to that article, thank you. Toth told 1200

1565
02:17:50,060 --> 02:17:57,180
WOAI Joe Pags, he says his bill would make attempting to enforce a federal gun ban in

1566
02:17:57,180 --> 02:18:03,260
Texas punishable by $50,000 five years in prison. Toth says he will file the measure

1567
02:18:03,260 --> 02:18:06,940
after speaking with the state Republican Attorney General, Greg Abbott, who has already vowed

1568
02:18:06,940 --> 02:18:10,900
to fight any federal measures which call for restrictions on weapons possession.

1569
02:18:10,900 --> 02:18:17,140
Toth concedes that he would welcome a legal fight over his proposals. At some point, there

1570
02:18:17,140 --> 02:18:20,420
needs to be a showdown between the state and the federal government over the supremacy

1571
02:18:20,420 --> 02:18:26,660
clause, he said. Darn right, I want Toth on. You know what Toth means, and what is it,

1572
02:18:26,660 --> 02:18:27,660
Hungarian?

1573
02:18:27,660 --> 02:18:39,300
That's death to gun control right there. Dr. Death for the gun bill. Man, ladies and gentlemen,

1574
02:18:39,300 --> 02:18:47,980
we need to deal with this. I got a new favorite person, this state rep. I want him on, I want

1575
02:18:47,980 --> 02:18:54,780
him on, I want him on. We gotta get on the offensive now. It's gonna be horrible, Obama's

1576
02:18:54,780 --> 02:18:57,900
gonna be surrounded by little kids when we have to protect him. How about from government

1577
02:18:57,900 --> 02:18:58,900
tyranny?

1578
02:18:58,900 --> 02:19:03,460
How about from all the kids you've been drone attacking? It's for the kids. I mean, how

1579
02:19:03,460 --> 02:19:10,220
manipulative, how evil. We need to have counter demonstrations and counter press conferences

1580
02:19:10,220 --> 02:19:15,900
with children. And say the federal government took guns out of schools and then the media

1581
02:19:15,900 --> 02:19:17,520
advertise it as shooting zones.

1582
02:19:17,520 --> 02:19:22,820
The blood's on your hands. The blood's on your hands, man, I'm so glad I got in the

1583
02:19:22,820 --> 02:19:28,620
face of Piers Morgan. I'm so glad I raised the Paul Revere alarm. I'm so glad. That's

1584
02:19:28,620 --> 02:19:39,700
what's gonna beat him is getting hardcore, not backing off to this. 800-25-99231, 800-25-99231.

1585
02:19:39,700 --> 02:19:44,620
They're coming, they're coming, drums, drums, drums in the deep. Now they're here. Told

1586
02:19:44,620 --> 02:19:47,220
you I heard the drums, now they're here.

1587
02:19:47,220 --> 02:19:51,900
They are coming, they are coming. Your call straight ahead, straight ahead. Stay with

1588
02:19:51,900 --> 02:19:56,940
us. Spread the word. Everybody tune in now. Key intel coming up and I'm calling for the

1589
02:19:56,940 --> 02:20:01,020
impeachment. I'm writing the bill of impeachment.

1590
02:20:01,020 --> 02:20:04,860
My name is Stephen Huir. After 22 years of nutritional counseling, I've observed that

1591
02:20:04,860 --> 02:20:09,580
most brain malfunctions have at their roots some form of toxicity and brain damage. So

1592
02:20:09,580 --> 02:20:13,680
whether it is poor memory, poor focus, lack of creative thinking, or more serious matters

1593
02:20:13,680 --> 02:20:18,060
like inability to focus, speak normally, or remember things, the emphasis to getting one's

1594
02:20:18,060 --> 02:20:23,080
brain working optimally needs to be on detoxification. One World Way supports your body's number

1595
02:20:23,080 --> 02:20:26,600
one means of detoxification, which is glutathione production.

1596
02:20:26,600 --> 02:20:31,580
My name is Angie and my son has suffered from borderline autism and constipation. I got

1597
02:20:31,580 --> 02:20:36,500
him on One World Way and in two months his constipation is gone. He has become friendlier,

1598
02:20:36,500 --> 02:20:41,380
he can carry on a normal conversation with me, and he has made his first friend. He's

1599
02:20:41,380 --> 02:20:45,900
doing great and he looks forward to taking One World Way every day. You could offer him

1600
02:20:45,900 --> 02:20:49,820
a present or a cake and he would prefer the One World Way.

1601
02:20:49,820 --> 02:21:00,780
Go to OneWorldWay.com, that's OneWorldW-H-E-Y.com or call 888-988-3325, that's 888-988-3325.

1602
02:21:00,780 --> 02:21:06,300
We travel so much and having a fake TV gives added peace of mind.

1603
02:21:06,300 --> 02:21:12,180
Burglars look for houses that appear to be easy targets, but fake TV can fool even professional

1604
02:21:12,180 --> 02:21:15,780
burglars into thinking someone is home watching television.

1605
02:21:15,780 --> 02:21:20,820
As a recent widow living alone, it gives me great peace of mind to set my fake TV near

1606
02:21:20,820 --> 02:21:25,340
a window and know that passing motorists and pedestrians will think someone is home watching

1607
02:21:25,340 --> 02:21:28,340
TV when I'm actually away from home.

1608
02:21:28,340 --> 02:21:32,700
Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet, just like a light on a timer.

1609
02:21:32,700 --> 02:21:37,260
And they're so easy to use, you just plug them in and they're ready to go. Plus, they're

1610
02:21:37,260 --> 02:21:40,900
so affordable that we have one upstairs and downstairs.

1611
02:21:40,900 --> 02:21:50,740
Fake TV is only $34.95. Order your fake TV by calling 877-5FAKETV or go to Faketv.com.

1612
02:21:50,740 --> 02:21:57,140
That's 877-532-5388 or Faketv.com.

1613
02:21:57,140 --> 02:21:59,780
Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.

1614
02:21:59,780 --> 02:22:04,580
Gold, it's like nothing else on earth. From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the

1615
02:22:04,580 --> 02:22:10,740
industrial age to the space age, gold has weathered the test of time. For 6,000 years,

1616
02:22:10,740 --> 02:22:14,620
gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth. According to the World Gold Council and the

1617
02:22:14,620 --> 02:22:19,440
U.S. Mint, demand is at an all-time high. The stage is being set for the reemergence

1618
02:22:19,440 --> 02:22:24,620
of gold as the common sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every

1619
02:22:24,620 --> 02:22:25,620
day.

1620

1636
02:24:10,420 --> 02:24:21,140
Okay, I'm gonna go to your phone calls as promised and Paul Watson out here in the brakes

1637
02:24:21,140 --> 02:24:27,980
are working on a bill of impeachment for Obama. So people can take our research and get it

1638
02:24:27,980 --> 02:24:35,140
into official documents. And that is the point of this. Bill of impeachment of Obama for

1639
02:24:35,140 --> 02:24:40,820
sedition and treason against the Republic of the United States of America. Boom, that's

1640
02:24:40,820 --> 02:24:41,820
your headline.

1641
02:24:41,820 --> 02:24:46,200
And then you take the Declaration of Independence and you basically rewrite it at the top. It's

1642
02:24:46,200 --> 02:24:50,620
the same thing. Whereas we've seen a long train of abuses against the Bill of Rights,

1643
02:24:50,620 --> 02:24:56,320
the Constitution, a president who's used his office to turn us over to NATO and UN control

1644
02:24:56,320 --> 02:25:03,300
that has publicly told Congress that the UN gives him orders and not the Congress who

1645
02:25:03,300 --> 02:25:12,940
has openly been fomenting and working with media, including foreign media, to overthrow

1646
02:25:12,940 --> 02:25:16,560
our Second Amendment.

1647
02:25:16,560 --> 02:25:22,280
And then you just break down the fact that it is an absolute imperative for Congress

1648
02:25:22,280 --> 02:25:30,700
not to have all of their just powers completely usurped. That Obama has signed secret directives

1649
02:25:30,700 --> 02:25:36,220
on cybersecurity and blocked Congress from seeing it when it is their right and their

1650
02:25:36,220 --> 02:25:42,380
duty. I mean, I've listed a whole laundry list of this, but it's two or three paragraphs

1651
02:25:42,380 --> 02:25:44,660
written like the Declaration of Independence.

1652
02:25:44,660 --> 02:25:50,700
You can read Clinton's bill of impeachment. It just states what he's done. That Obama

1653
02:25:50,700 --> 02:25:56,380
lied to Congress and lied to the people saying he didn't want the NDAA passed when he had

1654
02:25:56,380 --> 02:26:02,860
written it. And then said he wouldn't sign it and then did, lying. That's the president

1655
02:26:02,860 --> 02:26:07,420
lying to Congress. He wrote letters to Congress saying don't pass this when behind the scenes

1656
02:26:07,420 --> 02:26:09,280
he'd written letters saying pass it.

1657
02:26:09,280 --> 02:26:17,660
That's lying, that's perjury. Violating his oath of office on so many fronts, shutting

1658
02:26:17,660 --> 02:26:22,700
down power plants, implementing Kyoto protocols, even though Congress three years ago did not

1659
02:26:22,700 --> 02:26:29,540
pass the Kyoto greenhouse gas legislation. I mean, it's incredible. Giving selective

1660
02:26:29,540 --> 02:26:35,280
waivers to thousands of companies that are donors for that under Obamacare.

1661
02:26:35,280 --> 02:26:42,580
I mean, the list goes on and on here. I know Watson's listening right now. He's codifying

1662
02:26:42,580 --> 02:26:45,700
it all and I'll work with him more when the show's over. But we're gonna get this out

1663
02:26:45,700 --> 02:26:54,860
on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com. And it is absolutely essential that you get this

1664
02:26:54,860 --> 02:26:59,080
bill of impeachment because that's how impeachment works.

1665
02:26:59,080 --> 02:27:04,620
It goes through the House for a vote and you have a trial in the Senate. And if there was

1666
02:27:04,620 --> 02:27:09,140
any justice in this world, Obama would be impeached. We're gonna list Fast and Furious

1667
02:27:09,140 --> 02:27:14,480
and the lying to Congress about that. Look, look, look, he's getting away with everything.

1668
02:27:14,480 --> 02:27:21,340
And they're going to go for broke. And then finally, we need to state in the declaration

1669
02:27:21,340 --> 02:27:29,200
that we know that the criminals are moving, the usurpers, the occupiers for these corporate

1670
02:27:29,200 --> 02:27:32,540
foreign banks are doing this because they think they can win.

1671
02:27:32,540 --> 02:27:36,880
They think they've got enough dirt, enough blackmail, and enough everything that they

1672
02:27:36,880 --> 02:27:43,720
can get this through. And even if they can't, it gets us used to the idea of a dictator.

1673
02:27:43,720 --> 02:27:50,240
And whereas members of the Senate have pointed out that he's becoming a king, that's right.

1674
02:27:50,240 --> 02:27:57,520
And we kicked a king out of here in 1776, we've got to do it again.

1675
02:27:57,520 --> 02:28:01,780
And whereas Obama is trying to block arming the schools so they can protect themselves

1676
02:28:01,780 --> 02:28:08,320
and trying to bar the public from their ancient common right, common law right to self-defense,

1677
02:28:08,320 --> 02:28:12,960
he must be removed. And again, people say, well, Obama's a puppet.

1678
02:28:12,960 --> 02:28:17,440
Yes, they've all been puppets for a long time. But this guy is the head puppet and he's the

1679
02:28:17,440 --> 02:28:24,520
titular head of this treason. He's moving at warp speed. And Mitt Romney supported banning

1680
02:28:24,520 --> 02:28:25,520
guns as well.

1681
02:28:25,520 --> 02:28:31,720
I warned you folks that the fix was in either way you slice it. And if you think you're

1682
02:28:31,720 --> 02:28:35,820
just gonna turn your guns in and this is all gonna stop, you're gravely mistaken. There

1683
02:28:35,820 --> 02:28:42,160
will be people that resist this. And if there isn't, they will manufacture it to call them

1684
02:28:42,160 --> 02:28:51,240
terrorists to start the great purge. Homeland Security is a Soviet-style NKVD, okay?

1685
02:28:51,240 --> 02:28:56,520
That's what it is. That's why they popularized torture. By the way, he used to be impeached

1686
02:28:56,520 --> 02:29:00,120
for Benghazi, lying about that, saying he didn't know. Turned out they did know, add

1687
02:29:00,120 --> 02:29:07,880
that to the bill of impeachment. Missiles being sent to Al Qaeda with the Turkish ambassador,

1688
02:29:07,880 --> 02:29:09,800
add it to the impeachment, all of it.

1689
02:29:09,800 --> 02:29:13,560
There are crimes out in the open. Don't you wrap a bunch of kids up there around you on

1690
02:29:13,560 --> 02:29:17,560
the stage and say, I'm coming for your guns. Here's my executive order to see if you can

1691
02:29:17,560 --> 02:29:22,040
get away with this. Don't you do it. They want world government. These foreign banks

1692
02:29:22,040 --> 02:29:25,280
want unified, 80% worldwide taxes.

1693
02:29:25,280 --> 02:29:30,840
They can't stand the mafia in Chicago and New York that people are running down to places

1694
02:29:30,840 --> 02:29:36,040
like Texas and other areas that have lower taxes and more freedom. They want a worldwide

1695
02:29:36,040 --> 02:29:39,920
mafia where they're armed, you're not, and they can do whatever they want to you. Well,

1696
02:29:39,920 --> 02:29:46,640
I got news, thugs. You're going to lose. You've miscalculated. The sleeping giant is awakening.

1697
02:29:46,640 --> 02:29:50,360
10 million guns are getting sold a month.

1698
02:29:50,360 --> 02:29:58,480
We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.

1724
02:33:16,840 --> 02:33:29,880
Traveling patriots worldwide. You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.

1725
02:33:29,880 --> 02:33:35,040
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm proud of Texas. We're not perfect, but you notice we're national

1726
02:33:35,040 --> 02:33:42,080
news everywhere. Texas has the bill to arrest feds down here trying to take our guns. Texas

1727
02:33:42,080 --> 02:33:47,200
tried to get the bill passed, got killed by Perry at the top, unanimously in the house,

1728
02:33:47,200 --> 02:33:50,800
passed it to arrest the TSA.

1729
02:33:50,800 --> 02:33:55,800
Texas just introduced the legislation and our state representatives calling for the

1730
02:33:55,800 --> 02:34:03,640
impeachment of Barack Obama for high crimes and misdemeanors. It's happening. And I come

1731
02:34:03,640 --> 02:34:11,500
to you from the capital of Texas, Austin. I come to you from the heart of the resistance.

1732
02:34:11,500 --> 02:34:16,840
We are here. We are standing to the end. This is only the beginning, ladies and gentlemen.

1733
02:34:16,840 --> 02:34:22,820
This is only the beginning. And again, if we give the guns up, it's over. If you give

1734
02:34:22,820 --> 02:34:27,840
the guns up, they're gonna take everything. They will steal everything. They will shut

1735
02:34:27,840 --> 02:34:28,840
the economy down.

1736
02:34:28,840 --> 02:34:38,200
That is the Agenda 21 plan. These are hardcore criminals in government. I know a lot of congressmen

1737
02:34:38,200 --> 02:34:42,200
and women listen to this show in Tennessee and Virginia, you name it. I know I've talked

1738
02:34:42,200 --> 02:34:46,040
to them off air. I've had them on as guests, a lot of them. And they know, they privately

1739
02:34:46,040 --> 02:34:47,040
completely agree with me.

1740
02:34:47,040 --> 02:34:51,440
Well, it's now time to go public. Time to get up there on the floor of the house and

1741
02:34:51,440 --> 02:34:57,880
go, you are a crook, Obama. Okay, we either get in their face hardcore right now, or they're

1742
02:34:57,880 --> 02:35:03,200
gonna bring in tyranny, martial law. They're gonna hunt us down. They are gonna one by

1743
02:35:03,200 --> 02:35:05,200
one come after us.

1744
02:35:05,200 --> 02:35:08,940
And then if we resist to defend ourselves, we're gonna be called terrorist. We have got

1745
02:35:08,940 --> 02:35:13,640
to hit them while we still have the Internet and we still have talk radio with everything

1746
02:35:13,640 --> 02:35:20,400
we've got and stop playing Mr. Nicey Pants. Paul Revere rode through saying, to arms,

1747
02:35:20,400 --> 02:35:22,120
to arms, the redcoats are coming.

1748
02:35:22,120 --> 02:35:27,120
All I did was go on stand and say, you're on notice. You know this is gonna start 1776

1749
02:35:27,120 --> 02:35:34,520
part two if you try this. You redcoat? He's a redcoat. A guy fleeing justice in England.

1750
02:35:34,520 --> 02:35:46,480
I mean, give me a pirate. I'm here where my family's been for 300 plus years in the United

1751
02:35:46,480 --> 02:35:47,480
States.

1752
02:35:47,480 --> 02:35:53,840
I'm here in Texas where we've been since 1830 or even before. I'm here. I'm here. I'm in

1753
02:35:53,840 --> 02:35:58,800
a corner. I've got a right to self defense. I'm not your slave. I declare that natural

1754
02:35:58,800 --> 02:36:04,560
right before God in the universe. And it's time you declare it as well. By the way, the

1755
02:36:04,560 --> 02:36:07,000
Bundesbank's pulling their gold out of the US.

1756
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:12,960
How many countries? It's more than 20 countries in the last year, since early 2012, that have

1757
02:36:12,960 --> 02:36:19,520
pulled their gold out of the US. That article's up at infullwars.com. German Bundesbank to

1758
02:36:19,520 --> 02:36:25,140
repatriate gold from New York Fed. Trust in central banks by other central banks is ending.

1759
02:36:25,140 --> 02:36:31,920
That's a mainstream media headline by the New York Fed. The trust is over. That's why

1760
02:36:31,920 --> 02:36:36,000
they want the guns. These people are crooks. They should all be in jail like Bernie Madoff.

1761
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:41,720
You put Ken Lay and Bernie Madoff in jail. You put all these banksters, these Federal

1762
02:36:41,720 --> 02:36:46,120
Reserve top board members, a lot of their own board members have been saying it's tyranny.

1763
02:36:46,120 --> 02:36:48,820
Even board members have been saying what's happening is wrong, cuz they realize they're

1764
02:36:48,820 --> 02:36:51,920
gonna bring the whole thing down.

1765
02:36:51,920 --> 02:36:54,920
You know they've had the Dallas Fed head, the Kansas City Fed head, and others come

1766
02:36:54,920 --> 02:37:01,360
out and say what the Fed's doing is criminal? Their own people are saying it's criminal

1767
02:37:01,360 --> 02:37:11,360
publicly, because it's criminal. And listen, I'm not asking, I'm commanding police and

1768
02:37:11,360 --> 02:37:14,880
military as a sovereign citizen.

1769
02:37:14,880 --> 02:37:19,400
Just like you have citizens arrest, I'm giving you a citizens order to another citizen. You

1770
02:37:19,400 --> 02:37:25,080
know why I give you that order? You swore before God and man to protect and defend the

1771
02:37:25,080 --> 02:37:31,260
Constitution from all enemies foreign and domestic. And our Constitution is in shreds

1772
02:37:31,260 --> 02:37:32,260
right now.

1773
02:37:32,260 --> 02:37:37,520
They're trying to burn what's left of it. And if you won't hit the streets right now

1774
02:37:37,520 --> 02:37:42,300
aggressively, I don't care what you've got to do. I'm thinking about putting bullhorns

1775
02:37:42,300 --> 02:37:46,640
on the top of my car and driving around at 2 AM in neighborhoods bullhorning. And when

1776
02:37:46,640 --> 02:37:49,760
the cops pull up with their lights on and jump out and freak out, I'm gonna go, what

1777
02:37:49,760 --> 02:37:51,920
am I supposed to do?

1778
02:37:51,920 --> 02:37:55,780
I'm just Paul Revere driving through the night saying you're in danger. Our government's

1779
02:37:55,780 --> 02:38:01,000
been taken over by foreign powers. And see, that's a psy-op of truth. People only pay

1780
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:05,920
attention cuz they've never been warned in their sleep. I'm serious, I may put bullhorns

1781
02:38:05,920 --> 02:38:10,460
on my truck tonight and drive around announcing to people that the redcoats are coming.

1782
02:38:10,460 --> 02:38:15,680
Not saying the arms to arms, to info arms, because people will wake up. See, they're

1783
02:38:15,680 --> 02:38:20,000
in a comfort zone. They've got a normalcy bias. They've got a Stockholm syndrome, a

1784
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:26,320
learned helplessness to put up with anything. I wouldn't ask you to do that. I am intending

1785
02:38:26,320 --> 02:38:28,760
soon to start doing midnight rides.

1786
02:38:28,760 --> 02:38:36,480
I'm gonna start driving through neighborhoods. And if the cops arrest me, so be it. Because

1787
02:38:36,480 --> 02:38:39,240
I'm gonna start telling people, get up, get up when they come out. I'm gonna get out with

1788
02:38:39,240 --> 02:38:42,480
a bullhorn at night and say, Paul Revere, road to warn you what was happening.

1789
02:38:42,480 --> 02:38:46,160
Our country's been taken over by foreign banks. They're like, what are you doing, crazy man?

1790
02:38:46,160 --> 02:38:50,280
I'm crazy. You think you're gonna be free watching ESPN all day? You think you're gonna

1791
02:38:50,280 --> 02:38:54,400
be free not knowing about politics and not being involved? No, you're gonna be overrun

1792
02:38:54,400 --> 02:38:59,640
and made a slave if you don't defend your freedom, Thomas Jefferson.

1793
02:38:59,640 --> 02:39:04,260
That's how domesticated and sick the public is, that they see it weird when you hang a

1794
02:39:04,260 --> 02:39:09,040
banner hang on the highway about tyranny. Or when you call into radio and get upset.

1795
02:39:09,040 --> 02:39:13,680
I was on The Young Turks on Al Gore's foreign-owned TV thing last night. And they're going, you

1796
02:39:13,680 --> 02:39:21,720
need mental help. You need to go, yeah, I need mental help, don't I? I need mental help

1797
02:39:21,720 --> 02:39:24,960
because I know they're putting cancer viruses in the vaccines.

1798
02:39:24,960 --> 02:39:30,240
The top friend of the royal family, it's now being confirmed doing satanic rituals with

1799
02:39:30,240 --> 02:39:35,680
little kids. And it's not even a news item that why was this guy given total access to

1800
02:39:35,680 --> 02:39:41,080
the royal family? And it just confirms everything I already know. These are a bunch of child

1801
02:39:41,080 --> 02:39:44,600
molesting devil worshipers that run the New World Order.

1802
02:39:44,600 --> 02:39:49,320
They're evil. And people are like, that sounds crazy, really, that you don't know history.

1803
02:39:49,320 --> 02:39:57,680
Have you studied any historical groups? Scum always gets in control. That's why our forebearers

1804
02:39:57,680 --> 02:40:03,760
were this multi-thousand year leap forward, pointing out the evil and corruption of humankind,

1805
02:40:03,760 --> 02:40:07,600
especially at the top, and systems to tie that down and control it.

1806
02:40:07,600 --> 02:40:14,520
And now those final bulwarks are under absolute Alamo-level assault right now. I mean, this

1807
02:40:14,520 --> 02:40:20,880
is it, okay? This is a full-on assault. I know that we've got eugenicist criminals running

1808
02:40:20,880 --> 02:40:24,440
things. I've read countless books, they wrote how they're poisoning our food and water.

1809
02:40:24,440 --> 02:40:30,160
They think you're so dumb, they write confessions how they're killing us. And they know using

1810
02:40:30,160 --> 02:40:35,640
psychology how to hide it in plain view. Every cop, every military person, I command you

1811
02:40:35,640 --> 02:40:40,480
to follow your oath and to speak out and to resist this tyranny.

1812
02:40:40,480 --> 02:40:47,120
I command you, who have taken oaths to protect and defend, to speak out about what's happening.

1813
02:40:47,120 --> 02:40:52,040
I command the union heads, the politicians, all of the people that aren't pure evil, you

1814
02:40:52,040 --> 02:40:56,480
better decide what side you're on right now. And I command you, in the name of the Bill

1815
02:40:56,480 --> 02:41:00,080
of Rights, the Constitution, and the Declaration of Independence, not just the military and

1816
02:41:00,080 --> 02:41:01,080
the police.

1817
02:41:01,080 --> 02:41:07,960
But the public who has sat there on your hind ends, I command you, if you claim you're good

1818
02:41:07,960 --> 02:41:13,920
and you serve justice, I command you, in the name of the Republic, to activate now and

1819
02:41:13,920 --> 02:41:21,040
to stand up and to get in a posture of total resistance. But you think I came out and called

1820
02:41:21,040 --> 02:41:24,640
for a second American Revolution a few months ago cuz I was playing games?

1821
02:41:24,640 --> 02:41:31,760
I know what's happening. I know what's going on. I know what's happening. Listen, if we

1822
02:41:31,760 --> 02:41:36,560
just had regular old corrupt groups in who were really misguided and all this stuff,

1823
02:41:36,560 --> 02:41:40,400
I would not be this freaked out. Because I would say politically, we can fix it down

1824
02:41:40,400 --> 02:41:41,400
the road.

1825
02:41:41,400 --> 02:41:45,100
You're not gonna fix any of this. The pendulum isn't gonna swing back. The pendulum already

1826
02:41:45,100 --> 02:41:48,940
swung back. They know you hate them. They know you don't trust them. They didn't really

1827
02:41:48,940 --> 02:41:56,840
elect Obama. It's all a fraud, and they're coming for everybody. They want a hot takeover.

1828
02:41:56,840 --> 02:42:00,080
And if you don't know what a hot takeover is, look at what the Soviets did in the Ukraine

1829
02:42:00,080 --> 02:42:01,080
and Czechoslovakia.

1830
02:42:01,080 --> 02:42:07,080
Look at what Hitler did in Poland. If you don't know what a hot takeover is, it means

1831
02:42:07,080 --> 02:42:13,340
absolute war, guaranteed, and the globalists want the police to be killed. That's part

1832
02:42:13,340 --> 02:42:19,960
of the plan. Then they'll bring their scum in as the second wave. Let me tell you, I

1833
02:42:19,960 --> 02:42:21,040
can see it in their eyes.

1834
02:42:21,040 --> 02:42:24,840
The globalists are excited now. They're engaged. They're confident. And you know why they're

1835
02:42:24,840 --> 02:42:28,840
confident? They've been on the defensive. They're confident now because they're going

1836
02:42:28,840 --> 02:42:33,980
operational. They've already jumped out of the back of the plane, folks. They're already

1837
02:42:33,980 --> 02:42:37,680
coming in. They already pulled the trigger.

1838
02:42:37,680 --> 02:42:46,320
It's on. It's on. It is on. It is on. It is on. False flags, all of it. It is on. It

1839
02:42:46,320 --> 02:42:54,540
is on. It is on. You understand? These people put in the newspapers, they run Al-Qaeda.

1840
02:42:54,540 --> 02:42:57,920
And they saw the public suck their thumb. They went, okay, we're gonna take your guns

1841
02:42:57,920 --> 02:42:58,920
now.

1842
02:42:58,920 --> 02:43:01,800
We're gonna give your kids shots without telling you. We're gonna take your 12-year-old, give

1843
02:43:01,800 --> 02:43:07,040
them an abortion without telling you. We will raise your taxes. They're already saying they're

1844
02:43:07,040 --> 02:43:13,700
gonna raise the taxes again. They're already raising the payroll taxes on the entire population

1845
02:43:13,700 --> 02:43:23,180
that works. Man, they're sick. Let's go to the calls. Michelle, that's Michael in Canada.

1846
02:43:23,180 --> 02:43:24,180
You're on the air. Go ahead.

1847
02:43:24,180 --> 02:43:30,200
Hey, listen, Alex. First of all, I wanna say a couple of things about your appearances

1848
02:43:30,200 --> 02:43:36,720
on mainstream media lately. And number one is I cannot believe what a slimeball coward

1849
02:43:36,720 --> 02:43:42,920
that Piers Morgan is. To drag out the victim's families, to hide behind and throw rocks at

1850
02:43:42,920 --> 02:43:50,280
you from, what an act of absolute cowardice, betraying their very nature. Next thing I

1851
02:43:50,280 --> 02:43:59,400
wanna say about it is you have no idea still yet just what effect you are having with your

1852
02:43:59,400 --> 02:44:04,880
anger on the mainstream media. It is awakening and anger that's been there the whole time.

1853
02:44:04,880 --> 02:44:09,920
You are rousing people, giving them the permission themselves to get angry. And it's gonna unleash

1854
02:44:09,920 --> 02:44:13,760
their reaction and the response needed at this time.

1855
02:44:13,760 --> 02:44:19,080
Well, I just said, God, whatever you want me to do on the air, do it. And I just got

1856
02:44:19,080 --> 02:44:23,280
mad at that guy and that's what I did. And it's up to you guys what happens out of all

1857
02:44:23,280 --> 02:44:27,000
this. I mean, I am right up on the tip of the spear. I need everybody's prayers, but

1858
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:29,320
whatever happens, I'm not in fear.

1859
02:44:29,320 --> 02:44:33,480
I'm only in fear that I won't work hard enough, I won't do a good enough job. We've gotta

1860
02:44:33,480 --> 02:44:39,660
get America out of the trance. America is in a ninnying trance. The average American

1861
02:44:39,660 --> 02:44:44,480
would come out and shoot Paul Revere today. Okay, we've got to get out of this trance,

1862
02:44:44,480 --> 02:44:47,620
this learned helplessness. God bless you, Michael.

1863
02:44:47,620 --> 02:44:53,160
Let's go ahead and talk to who's up next here. Let's go ahead and talk to Mark in Kansas.

1864
02:44:53,160 --> 02:44:56,680
Mark in Kansas, you're on the air, go ahead.

1865
02:44:56,680 --> 02:45:03,720
Yes, Alex. Thanks for taking the call. I just want to first off say that my family prays

1866
02:45:03,720 --> 02:45:12,960
for your family every day and we appreciate everything you do. The local Prestitude Media

1867
02:45:12,960 --> 02:45:22,560
broke a story today that Walmart is offering to employ any veteran that wants a job here

1868
02:45:22,560 --> 02:45:30,240
on the local media. And I just want to call attention to that. I hope that our veterans

1869
02:45:30,240 --> 02:45:38,000
don't fall for this McDonald's trinket in the Happy Meal bobble that they're gonna hang

1870
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:41,400
out there in front of them and fall for that crap.

1871
02:45:41,400 --> 02:45:46,800
Walmart shouldn't have sold the slave goods all these years and been used to deindustrialize

1872
02:45:46,800 --> 02:45:51,240
our country. And Walmart shouldn't have promoted NAFTA and GATT. But no, yeah, exactly. They've

1873
02:45:51,240 --> 02:45:55,900
domesticated you now and we're down here in the pits kind of like telling us rub the lotion

1874
02:45:55,900 --> 02:45:58,900
on our skin.

1875
02:45:58,900 --> 02:46:02,400
They just want a good skin when they skin us.

1876
02:46:02,400 --> 02:46:08,800
Better way to surveil and keep a thumb on our veterans than to try and bring them into

1877
02:46:08,800 --> 02:46:15,880
the fold for 29 hours a week so that they don't have to pay the Obamacare tax on them

1878
02:46:15,880 --> 02:46:23,000
again. That being said, I hope our military and our veterans understand what that's all

1879
02:46:23,000 --> 02:46:24,240
about.

1880
02:46:24,240 --> 02:46:31,840
The other thing is I just implore that your listeners do anything that they can with their

1881
02:46:31,840 --> 02:46:37,000
state legislatures to try and get them to abolish.

1882
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:41,160
Everyone should be driving to their state house now, whether it's in session or not,

1883
02:46:41,160 --> 02:46:45,120
and running up and down the halls getting in everybody's faces. Everybody should be

1884
02:46:45,120 --> 02:46:50,760
doing banner hangs. Everyone should be spending hours a day fighting, okay?

1885
02:46:50,760 --> 02:46:55,560
I mean, and again, just get aggressive, get the buzz going, wake up America, and just

1886
02:46:55,560 --> 02:47:00,200
keep pointing out criminals run Washington. They're not misguided liberals. These are

1887
02:47:00,200 --> 02:47:03,560
horrible authoritarian mafia thugs.

1888
02:47:03,560 --> 02:47:12,600
Yeah, the listeners need to understand we are financing our own enslavement. And just

1889
02:47:12,600 --> 02:47:19,400
one thought in getting off the air, when we can no longer feed the beast, the beast is

1890
02:47:19,400 --> 02:47:22,280
gonna feed on us, and we're almost there.

1891
02:47:22,280 --> 02:47:27,680
Well, that's how it always works. You're absolutely right. You're absolutely right. And that's

1892
02:47:27,680 --> 02:47:32,840
where it always goes to forced labor camps because the parasites always destroy everything.

1893
02:47:32,840 --> 02:47:36,440
And then finally just say, okay, you're gonna work in a forced labor camp for me.

1894
02:47:36,440 --> 02:47:40,000
And then there's never even goods there, so they always invade the next country to loot

1895
02:47:40,000 --> 02:47:45,720
them. I mean, this is what we have been overrun by absolute criminals. God bless you. Yeah,

1896
02:47:45,720 --> 02:47:49,640
I was looking at impeachment reasons in the Constitution. We're gonna add to the article

1897
02:47:49,640 --> 02:47:54,600
that Paul Watson and I are putting together, impeachment for high crimes and misdemeanors.

1898
02:47:54,600 --> 02:48:00,000
Perjury of oath. Swear to uphold the Constitution, authorize for war. I mean, boom, right there.

1899
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:06,200
Said that the UN and NATO runs it, not Congress. Second Amendment, NATO. Birth certificate

1900
02:48:06,200 --> 02:48:12,960
issues, NDAA. Abuse of authority, Second Amendment, Libya, Fast and Furious, TSA, Fourth Amendment,

1901
02:48:12,960 --> 02:48:13,960
NDAA hoax.

1902
02:48:13,960 --> 02:48:18,840
EPA versus Cole, lying to Congress, abuse of executive orders to circumvent Congress

1903
02:48:18,840 --> 02:48:26,040
and bragging about it to the press. Missiles to Al-Qaeda, Libya, Syria. Bribery. I mean,

1904
02:48:26,040 --> 02:48:30,320
what do you call it when he gives waivers to companies that give him campaign donations?

1905
02:48:30,320 --> 02:48:37,360
Intimidations, Valerie Jarrett, misuse of assets, the vacations, the selective waivers

1906
02:48:37,360 --> 02:48:42,560
for EPA versus Cole, failures to supervise Fast and Furious. So you don't even have to

1907
02:48:42,560 --> 02:48:47,600
be consciously doing it, just dereliction of duty. Get out of here, you scum. Okay,

1908
02:48:47,600 --> 02:48:49,520
you got caught lying to Congress about Fast and Furious.

1909
02:48:49,520 --> 02:48:53,480
How about you killed all those people in Mexico and the US, you're impeached for that, along

1910
02:48:53,480 --> 02:48:59,580
with your stinking Attorney General. Fast and Furious, lying about Benghazi, missiles

1911
02:48:59,580 --> 02:49:06,560
to Al-Qaeda, lying about radiation dangers in the wake of Fukushima. And the 48 leaking

1912
02:49:06,560 --> 02:49:12,640
nuclear power plants, dereliction of duty goes on. Conduct unbecoming, and we go through

1913
02:49:12,640 --> 02:49:17,240
a big list of those, refusal to obey a lawful order, authorization for war.

1914
02:49:17,240 --> 02:49:20,840
Congress sent him a letter, said you can't do this, he still did it. Said I don't need

1915
02:49:20,840 --> 02:49:27,400
you, he was belligerent to Congress. Man, man, they're planning something big, they're coming

1916
02:49:27,400 --> 02:49:32,200
after the guns. I can just see when they blow up some buildings and then pose as saviors,

1917
02:49:32,200 --> 02:49:37,360
it's gonna be so sick. And the public's so soft too. Mark in Oregon, you're on the air,

1918
02:49:37,360 --> 02:49:38,360
go ahead.

1919
02:49:38,360 --> 02:49:39,360
Hello, brother Alex.

1920
02:49:39,360 --> 02:49:41,360
Good, go ahead sir, welcome.

1921
02:49:41,360 --> 02:49:48,200
Alex, I've got what I think are two of the most important points that could be made at

1922
02:49:48,200 --> 02:49:54,600
this point in time. And number one is simply that Joyce Riley is having an expose of all

1923
02:49:54,600 --> 02:50:00,160
of the gross inconsistencies of the Sandy Hook shooting, including the big red circle

1924
02:50:00,160 --> 02:50:03,280
around Sandy Hook on the map in the Batman movie.

1925
02:50:03,280 --> 02:50:09,600
Today or tomorrow, I thought maybe you'd have her on and she could go over things with him.

1926
02:50:09,600 --> 02:50:14,480
Yeah, that's an interesting idea. We've done some expose of that, we pretty much broke

1927
02:50:14,480 --> 02:50:20,400
the Batman information. Before it happened, we said Batman's a trigger movie. And the

1928
02:50:20,400 --> 02:50:25,160
media is like, why are they pointing at Batman now? Like we just randomly went and looked

1929
02:50:25,160 --> 02:50:27,280
in Batman and found Sandy Hook.

1930
02:50:27,280 --> 02:50:33,300
Bain mailed out, the movie producers had Bain mail out to hundreds of different media groups

1931
02:50:33,300 --> 02:50:38,920
a map of targets and one of them Sandy Hook. And then the other movie, before it had a

1932
02:50:38,920 --> 02:50:43,000
bunch of triggers in it, so I hear you, I hear you. Look, I just haven't gone there

1933
02:50:43,000 --> 02:50:48,880
because the general public doesn't understand why they do this stuff, it's too esoteric.

1934
02:50:48,880 --> 02:50:53,040
Obviously there were other shooters, obviously the Batman shooting. Again, that happened

1935
02:50:53,040 --> 02:50:59,280
with the Batman film. You get it, it's Batman, Batman in Colorado. He was under government

1936
02:50:59,280 --> 02:51:00,280
funding.

1937
02:51:00,280 --> 02:51:06,480
Feeling like there are too many pressures and demands on you? Losing sleep, worrying

1938
02:51:06,480 --> 02:51:11,380
about tests and school work, either on the run because your schedule is just too busy?

1946
02:52:00,960 --> 02:52:05,480
Hi there, my name is Frank Bates. What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could

1947
02:52:05,480 --> 02:52:12,240
get me in a lot of trouble. I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com

1948
02:52:12,240 --> 02:52:16,480
that exposes the electricity monopolies and government agencies for what they really are,

1949
02:52:16,480 --> 02:52:21,120
incompetent line crooks that are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power

1950
02:52:21,120 --> 02:52:26,640
bills criminally high. Some have called this a conspiracy, others have called it a cover-up

1951
02:52:26,640 --> 02:52:33,580
and you will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy goes. My video at 123coverup.com

too. Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen

1957

Digestive health is the key to wellness and elimination of toxins. That bears repeating.

or call toll free, 866-369-3678. That's 866-369-3678. ProEM-1, the raw probiotic.

1967
02:54:18,080 --> 02:54:25,720
I give you our leader Rahm Emanuel, our king. He says we don't need the people to be involved

1968
02:54:25,720 --> 02:54:30,760
in the debate. You're just scum. The police are God and they'll decide to take the guns.

1969
02:54:30,760 --> 02:54:35,760
Here is the Chicago Don Rahm Emanuel, Israeli officer. Here he is.

1970
02:54:35,760 --> 02:54:40,800
One, it's all about criminal access. It's not about gun control. It's about criminal

1971
02:54:40,800 --> 02:54:47,440
access to guns. That changes the debate. Two, put the police chief in the law enforcement

1972
02:54:47,440 --> 02:54:53,560
community front and center. Everybody else, from politician to whatever, take a back seat,

1973
02:54:53,560 --> 02:54:57,080
because the police chiefs have a credibility and authority and a voice on this, which is

1974
02:54:57,080 --> 02:55:02,260
why they're all there. I do believe, as it relates to both the type of weapon being an

1975
02:55:02,260 --> 02:55:07,440
assault weapon in this case, or the assault magazine, as Mike has, I think, strenuously

1976
02:55:07,440 --> 02:55:14,580
focused us on message on that, because the difference between a magazine that holds ten

1977
02:55:14,580 --> 02:55:19,640
and a magazine that holds 20 or 30 is a lot of different type of damage that's done.

1978
02:55:19,640 --> 02:55:21,520
And those are the three things I do think-

1979
02:55:21,520 --> 02:55:28,400
All right, folks, so there you go. The government has credibility. The police do. Even elected

1980
02:55:28,400 --> 02:55:32,480
representatives, you take a back seat, pandering to the police. These police chiefs are all

1981
02:55:32,480 --> 02:55:39,440
basically federal minions, almost all the big ones are. Just amazing that we've gotten

1982
02:55:39,440 --> 02:55:44,580
to this point in this country. And it's gonna get bad, but the offshore banks, they want

1983
02:55:44,580 --> 02:55:45,580
a civil war.

1984
02:55:45,580 --> 02:55:50,280
That's part of the plan. It's not that they don't care if you die. They want you to die

1985
02:55:50,280 --> 02:55:55,760
in a war with the American people. It's essential to call Congress, to call your state reps,

1986
02:55:55,760 --> 02:56:01,500
but to travel there physically. It is essential to print off news articles from mfallwars.com

1987
02:56:01,500 --> 02:56:05,520
and to physically bring them to the local radio station, the local TV station.

1988
02:56:05,520 --> 02:56:12,640
It is essential when these articles of impeachment, this bill of impeachment, but it will be articles

1989
02:56:12,640 --> 02:56:17,900
of impeachment. That's what we'll call it. That's the proper term. Go everywhere. It'll

1990
02:56:17,900 --> 02:56:29,180
be up the next hour or so at mfallwars.com and prisonplanet.com. It's essential. Let's

1991
02:56:29,180 --> 02:56:31,640
go ahead and go to John in Texas.

1992
02:56:31,640 --> 02:56:38,600
John, you're on the air. I'm not doing too good, man. They wouldn't be doing this if

1993
02:56:38,600 --> 02:56:41,440
they're not planning something else. They're gonna probably shoot up some more schools

1994
02:56:41,440 --> 02:56:44,960
and probably blow up some federal buildings to make themselves look like heroes.

1995
02:56:44,960 --> 02:56:50,800
That's true. Hey, I'm a professional dog trainer here out of Dallas, Texas. And I was in the

1996
02:56:50,800 --> 02:56:55,760
middle of one of my sessions the other day. And there was a lady, one of my clients, she

1997
02:56:55,760 --> 02:56:58,640
had a problem with her dog jumping on the couch.

1998
02:56:58,640 --> 02:57:03,720
That's a very simple thing to solve. And she kept telling me, she yells at the dog. She

1999
02:57:03,720 --> 02:57:07,640
tried to get treats to reel the dog off into the floor. And I just simply went up to the

2000
02:57:07,640 --> 02:57:12,120
dog and did a little, and just gave him a little poke and he got off the couch. He never

2001
02:57:12,120 --> 02:57:16,520
got back on the couch again. And she was amazed at how quickly I trained her dog.

2002
02:57:16,520 --> 02:57:21,140
These criminals are running wild. They're trying to intimidate us with all the weapons

2003
02:57:21,140 --> 02:57:25,160
and stuff that we paid for. And they need to be put in line.

2004
02:57:25,160 --> 02:57:31,920
Here's my point, Alex. This topic about our guns and the Second Amendment is not up for

2005
02:57:31,920 --> 02:57:36,120
debate. The dog on the couch, we don't have a debate with the dog. We don't ask him to

2006
02:57:36,120 --> 02:57:40,680
get off the couch. We are here to tell the government, do not take our guns. It's our

2007
02:57:40,680 --> 02:57:45,440
Second Amendment. It's in law. It's in stone. We know our rights. It's not up to you. We

2008
02:57:45,440 --> 02:57:50,680
don't belong to you. You belong to us. We pay our taxes for your salary. You got that?

2009
02:57:50,680 --> 02:57:55,280
I agree. Everybody should call Obama and call all their media publications and get aggressive

2010
02:57:55,280 --> 02:58:01,100
with them. Say, look, you gangster scum. You're not gonna run a New York operation here. You

2011
02:58:01,100 --> 02:58:02,100
got that?

2012
02:58:02,100 --> 02:58:10,120
We don't need to call them. They're listening to this right now. Better believe it.

2013
02:58:10,120 --> 02:58:14,380
It's important to put it into action. Listen, if you're not an approved little protest group,

2014
02:58:14,380 --> 02:58:18,440
they arrest you trying to hold a sign in front of the White House. They wanna turn America

2015
02:58:18,440 --> 02:58:24,120
into North Korea. And I wanna tell everybody something. They're already shutting the economy

2016
02:58:24,120 --> 02:58:27,280
off. They're already gonna shut your power off and increase the power prices. They're

2017
02:58:27,280 --> 02:58:31,320
already gonna, listen, they just want the guns because they wanna get a physical fight

2018
02:58:31,320 --> 02:58:37,000
going with us. The new world order has occupied America. The federal government is overrun

2019
02:58:37,000 --> 02:58:39,160
and captured. Red alert.

02:59:52,240 --> 02:59:58,760
Coast to coast, direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.

2034
02:59:58,760 --> 03:00:12,760
Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does

2035
03:00:12,760 --> 03:00:21,760
he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.

2036
03:00:21,760 --> 03:00:29,200
Ladies and gentlemen, they're gonna devalue the dollar down to nothing. It's already started.

2037
03:00:29,200 --> 03:00:32,960
Foreign countries everywhere like Germany are jerking their gold out of the Federal

2038
03:00:32,960 --> 03:00:38,640
Reserve. Everybody knows America is run by evil. Everybody knows our government runs

2039
03:00:38,640 --> 03:00:45,800
Al-Qaeda. And I wish that wasn't the case. But I am proud of Texas. We got state reps

2040
03:00:45,800 --> 03:00:47,960
and federal reps fighting hard.

2041
03:00:47,960 --> 03:00:52,720
Those articles are all up at Infowars.com. Obama's anti-Second Amendment executive orders

2042
03:00:52,720 --> 03:00:58,760
may result in articles of impeachment. And we are putting out our own articles of impeachment.

2043
03:00:58,760 --> 03:01:04,580
I mean, the people's articles of impeachment, that's what I'm gonna call it. Where'd my

2044
03:01:04,580 --> 03:01:09,320
cell phone go? I was just, you had it with Watson out there on it. I gotta finish writing

2045
03:01:09,320 --> 03:01:10,320
this with him.

2046
03:01:10,320 --> 03:01:16,200
A German boondess bank to repatriate gold from New York Fed. Texas Congressman threatens

2047
03:01:16,200 --> 03:01:22,400
Obama with impeachment if he uses executive orders on guns. New York State Senator gun

2048
03:01:22,400 --> 03:01:27,440
bill passed in the middle of the night, turns law-abiding citizens into criminals. New York

2049
03:01:27,440 --> 03:01:33,920
Senate passes draconian gun bill. Walmart forbids new ammunition orders. Yes, that's

2050
03:01:33,920 --> 03:01:35,600
Chuck Schumer's order.

2051
03:01:35,600 --> 03:01:39,760
By decree of the king, there are some steps that we can take that don't require legislation.

2052
03:01:39,760 --> 03:01:47,080
I mean, it is just on, on, on, on, on. And folks, I mean, if they can take the guns,

2053
03:01:47,080 --> 03:01:54,660
they can do anything. Man, it's gonna be like a new drug war. I guess you'll get your guns

2054
03:01:54,660 --> 03:01:58,200
from the government in the future, like you get your drugs from the government.

2055
03:01:58,200 --> 03:02:03,400
You'll still get your guns, they can lock up whoever they want selectively. But I guess

2056
03:02:03,400 --> 03:02:10,800
you'll buy your guns from the corrupt police now. So ridiculous. Man, I have seen this

2057
03:02:10,800 --> 03:02:16,580
from every angle. I know exactly where it's going. Who's up next here? Let's talk to Jed

2058
03:02:16,580 --> 03:02:17,580
in Michigan.

2059
03:02:17,580 --> 03:02:20,840
And you disagree with impeaching our Lord and Savior Obama?

2060
03:02:20,840 --> 03:02:27,520
Yes, sir, I do. I don't think he should be impeached. I think he should be arrested immediately,

2061
03:02:27,520 --> 03:02:31,200
thrown into chains, tied to a pole, whatever you wanna call it.

2062
03:02:31,200 --> 03:02:37,600
He's a puppet, but his office is evil. And Obama does hate liberty. He is an authoritarian

2063
03:02:37,600 --> 03:02:42,920
scum who thinks he's better than everybody. And you can see him, like he said, I'm not

2064
03:02:42,920 --> 03:02:46,560
gonna act nice anymore. Now the mean Obama, when he has those little kids out there tomorrow

2065
03:02:46,560 --> 03:02:49,800
though, he's sure gonna use them, isn't he?

2066
03:02:49,800 --> 03:02:55,920
Yeah, he will use every single little avenue that he can. But every time somebody talks

2067
03:02:55,920 --> 03:03:01,640
about impeaching him, it reminds me of an example of if a McDonald employee was to give

2068
03:03:01,640 --> 03:03:04,680
me the keys in the middle of the night and I go in there and rob the place. And then

2069
03:03:04,680 --> 03:03:08,520
they think about, there's a debate on whether or not the guy should be fired from McDonald's

2070
03:03:08,520 --> 03:03:09,520
or not.

2071
03:03:09,520 --> 03:03:14,280
And by the way, Obama wants background checks to buy bullets and is gonna make it illegal

2072
03:03:14,280 --> 03:03:18,080
all your retroactive bullets. Look at the Washington Post right here. They're announcing

2073
03:03:18,080 --> 03:03:23,760
all the evil that's gonna be announced tomorrow. Unbelievable. Obama to Unville, broad gun

2074
03:03:23,760 --> 03:03:32,320
plan, including going after the bullets with executive orders. I mean, I'm sorry, go ahead.

2075
03:03:32,320 --> 03:03:37,360
Two days after Ron Paul gave his farewell speech, and during his farewell speech, he

2076
03:03:37,360 --> 03:03:42,600
said that he made a comment that the Constitution has failed. And I heard you agree with him,

2077
03:03:42,600 --> 03:03:45,760
and I love you, man, but the Constitution has not failed, okay?

2078
03:03:45,760 --> 03:03:48,800
We the people have failed the Constitution. And-

2079
03:03:48,800 --> 03:03:51,760
Wait, I didn't say the Constitution's failed.

2080
03:03:51,760 --> 03:03:54,680
You might have to go back, cuz I could have swore to God that you-

2081
03:03:54,680 --> 03:04:00,640
No, no, I say all the time, people say the Constitution or capitalism failed. We failed.

2082
03:04:00,640 --> 03:04:03,880
We're not following it is why things are getting so bad.

2083
03:04:03,880 --> 03:04:10,440
We the people have allowed this to happen. I mean, at every point in time in history,

2084
03:04:10,440 --> 03:04:16,480
we could have prevented this, but we don't have the fire under us, I guess, to do that.

2085
03:04:16,480 --> 03:04:22,080
You know, when Obama gave a little speech saying that he's not gonna, don't worry, I'm

2086
03:04:22,080 --> 03:04:26,440
not gonna come get your gun. I'm sitting there saying, don't worry, you ain't got the manpower

2087
03:04:26,440 --> 03:04:28,160
to come get our guns, all right?

2088
03:04:28,160 --> 03:04:32,800
There's 100 million of us. What are we gonna do? We don't even need guns. We can all just

2089
03:04:32,800 --> 03:04:38,360
pick up stone, throw it at the same time, and that's over.

2090
03:04:38,360 --> 03:04:44,600
It's just to order all gun owners licensed every five years. Bloomberg urges Obama to

2091
03:04:44,600 --> 03:04:51,120
defy Congress, 54,000 Mexican sign petition to take our guns. My gosh, I mean, this is

2092
03:04:51,120 --> 03:04:56,720
so bad. Feds delay arrest of illegal immigrant and registered sex offender working for senator

2093
03:04:56,720 --> 03:04:57,720
until after election.

2094
03:04:57,720 --> 03:05:17,400
They're a bunch of scum.
