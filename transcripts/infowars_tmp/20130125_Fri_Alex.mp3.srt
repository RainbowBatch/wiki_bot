1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:36,080
he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.

3
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:40,920
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us. This is going to be a particularly

4
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,720
powerful broadcast today. Dr. Jerome Corsi of WorldNetDaily, and of course, of all the

5
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:50,240
New York Times, number one bestsellers, is scheduled to be in studio with us coming up

6
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:54,040
later in the hour.

7
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:58,560
And obviously, I'm gonna be covering a lot of important news in the meantime. The news

8
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:05,880
is all so completely out of control and over the top that I don't even know how to respond

9
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:12,720
at this point. If you go up to Infowars.com, airport terror announcements now being played

10
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,720
in hotels.

11
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:18,680
I mean, this is beyond 1984, where Big Brother's only in government buildings saying, watch

12
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:23,380
your neighbors, look out for terrorists. This is now in the hotels. And they spy on the

13
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:29,340
patrons and fill out data sheets on you even while you're eating. This is 5,000 plus major

14
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,720
US hotels signed on to do this, all official.

15
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:38,840
TSA is now conducting random warrantless checkpoints on South Lamar, that's about a mile and a

16
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:45,360
half from where I'm sitting, and are searching people's persons and bags. And they announced

17
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,300
they're just gonna do whatever they want. And I was told this about three months ago

18
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,920
by a senior Austin police officer.

19
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:56,520
He said they'd been told that they can't search someone without a warrant, but that the federal

20
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:01,000
government is basically putting us under a civil emergency quietly. And that they're

21
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,880
being told that you can do it when the TSA is there with you. And Austin police bullied

22
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:14,600
people into being groped. And it's on local ABC News, we have the clip up there.

23
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:21,960
This is going on yesterday while I'm on the radio. And reportedly, they're gonna be back.

24
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:26,760
So it's gonna be a semi-permanent deal, just like Dallas and Houston. And I tell people

25
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,580
five years ago TSA was showing up in Dallas and people said, that's not true, I haven't

26
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:31,580
seen it on the news.

27
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:35,080
But I talked to family that saw it. And about two years ago, they started having it in the

28
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:39,280
news. There's no way you're gonna have feds searching people on the side of the road.

29
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,360
Well, it's going on right now. And I mean, they had the army out at public events searching

30
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:48,880
us in Austin, and they never announced it. It's there to acclimate in condition. All

31
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:52,440
the border is wide open. In fact, I have video, we haven't even aired yet, we've been so overwhelmed

32
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:58,560
and busy of illegal aliens just crossing in droves on the Texas-Mexico border.

33
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:05,200
While the border patrol backs up park rangers harassing a UT alumni group of lawyers sitting

34
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,080
around drinking a few courage lights. And they were writing them tickets, everything

35
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:16,560
else. And I'm like, hey, there's illegal aliens right there, and just laughing at me. And

36
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:22,080
then driving 70 miles from up by the border into the US and coming to a checkpoint where

37
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,400
they wanted to search the vehicle.

38
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,360
But I basically got in their face and told them, no, well, we've got all the footage

39
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:34,160
of this. I mean, it's us, we comply, so we are slaves. And then I have off the chart

40
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:44,400
video in Illinois where the neighbor and the homeowner, the police come and go over their

41
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,560
fence without a warrant with the power company to put smart meters on that on record eavesdrop

42
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,560
on you.

43
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,900
And dial into all your new smart appliances on record and control how hot or cold your

44
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:00,060
house can be and double charge you and all the rest of this garbage. It was developed

45
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:07,120
by Enron 15 years ago as part of their fraud program. And the police, they're standing

46
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,680
on the street and the police say, I don't give you authorization to fill me. The woman

47
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:15,940
put it on YouTube and the police came, this is in the Chicago Tribune, and arrested her

48
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,080
and are charging her with resisting.

49
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:24,320
They say, in the affidavit, talking to them was resisting. And the woman's like, you don't

50
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,480
have a right to be in my backyard. I don't want this smart meter. I've told them I don't

51
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:33,520
want it. And the police say, we'll do whatever we want. And they look like total guns. And

52
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,000
then they came and arrested her and they said, you're lucky we're not charging with a felony.

53
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,820
Actually, the courts have thrown it out over 100 times in Illinois. They're doing it as

54
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:46,840
the misdemeanor so they can trick her in the regular court to not getting her jury trial.

55
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:52,880
I mean, this government is absolutely rapacious and criminal. We're all in grave danger. The

56
00:04:52,880 --> 00:05:00,400
founders warned us, keep government on a short leash or it'll put you on a leash.

57
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,440

that the state is God. The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most

79
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,480
impressive police states on earth. This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret

80
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:26,560
network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide. This documentary exposes how the continuity

81
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,520
of government program has established an all powerful shadow state. Police state four chronicles

88
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:19,360
to the Alex Jones show. It is Friday, the 25th day of January 2013. I am your host,

89
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,720
Alex Jones, and we're going to be here live for the next three hours. Dr. Jerome Corsi

90
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:28,080
is here. He'll be in studio with us coming up in about 25 minutes, and we have other

91
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,400
guests today coming up as well.

92
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:37,840
Okay, where to start? Number one, Dianne Feinstein's gun confiscation bill, because that's basically

93
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:46,360
what it does, and it bans hundreds and hundreds of guns, not 150, exempts police and retired

94
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:55,600
police and other government workers for life from these laws. This is a title of nobility.

95
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:01,120
That's what nobility was. You could be signed up as a sir, was the lowest level, and then

96
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:09,200
ride up to lords and dukes and barons. If you would serve the system, well, you're exempt

97
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,940
from all the laws.

98
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:17,440
And that's what one of the Rockefellers told the late, great filmmaker Aaron Russo in Hollywood.

99
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,320
He told him, look, we're all gonna have a microchip that says, kiss my butt, using the

100
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,940
more pejorative term, kiss my you know what. Where we're just above the law, national security,

101
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:32,720
we go around the checkpoints, around the body scanners, around the control, we're exempt,

102
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,720
you're not.

103
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:38,320
You'll all be face scanned and controlled. Well, Rand Corporation, MIT, they've all said

104
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:46,960
that is the plan. And we are going under martial law, incrementally, checkpoints all over the

105
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:53,560
highways, police taking blood without warrants. Now gang gun checkpoints all over the country

106
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:57,800
where they randomly from New York to Texas, pull you over and search your car.

107
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:02,680
Totally illegal, but it's being announced. We got the video coming up with this and the

108
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:09,000
audio for radio listeners, the article's up at infowars.com right now. TSA conducts random

109
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,960
checks at Austin train station. Well, actually, they did it out on South Lamar on the road

110
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:20,420
downtown. And we have the video, that is coming up.

111
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:26,680
We have, again, Feinstein gun control bill to exempt government officials. That's anybody

112
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:30,640
in government, federal government, for life and police. See, the police are like, well,

113
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,680
I don't wanna give my guns up when I retire. Well, they're saying, don't worry, you're

114
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,680
gonna be exempt.

115
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:41,360
They told the Russian military and the Russian federal police the same thing in 1917. And

116
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,840
so they went along with the gun confiscation of the general public. And of course, you

117
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:49,600
know what happened to the police and military after that. This is a totally unconstitutional

118
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:56,800
discriminatory, but see, you're taught discrimination is black, white, North, South, man, woman,

119
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,680
Hispanic, white, Catholic, Protestant. You're taught all that.

120
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:06,080
No, discrimination is the big mega banks exempt from taxes, lobbying to have your taxes raised

121
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:14,120
to give themselves corporate welfare your money. Discrimination is governments exempt

122
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:22,480
from smart meter corporate taxes, but you are double, triple charged. Smart meters,

123
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:28,620
and all of this are the tools of total control. And we actually have articles here out of

124
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:35,140
the Daily Caller, but also one out of the Huffington Post where they quote the Democrats

125
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:39,860
and Governor Cuomo and others is saying, it doesn't exclude retired police officers.

126
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:45,040
So all of them have to turn in their guns and magazines and stuff like that. He said,

127
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:52,200
what they did is disarm the good guys and make sure the bad guys outlaw them. That was

128
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:57,640
said by a police officer. But so now they're talking about trying to pass a law in New

129
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:02,400
York so the police can keep their guns. Here's another one, Feinstein gun control bill to

130
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:08,400
exempt government officials. Not everyone will have and be able to abide by Senator

131
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,080
Dianne Feinstein's gun control bill.

132
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:15,020
If the proposed legislation becomes law, government officials, not servants, they are officials,

133
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:23,040
they are royalty. Red carpets, everything, and others will be exempt. And it goes on

134
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:30,440
to say feds, police, and others that can get a federal waiver. So see, that's out of the

135
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:35,040
weekly standard. Ladies and gentlemen, this is what our forebears revolted against.

136
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:42,600
You could not buy land unless you were nobility in the colonies, large pieces of land. You

137
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:46,480
couldn't get an export license or an import license unless you were, quote, part of the

138
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:54,640
gentry nobility, a sir or above, a lord's son. And so everybody sat there, not able

139
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:59,880
to do business, not able to live, watching lesser men run everything.

140
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:06,200
George Washington couldn't manufacture carriages, he wanted to. He had to buy at five, six times

141
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:12,360
what they cost in England on top of the shipping, his gentleman's carriage. You had to buy

142
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:16,440
the finished clothes from England. There were laws, you couldn't make firearms, you couldn't

143
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:20,200
make hammers, you couldn't make nails, you couldn't have finished goods here.

144
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:25,020
As a globalist tool, mercantile tool, to not let development take place and to make everything

145
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:29,480
be back in the home country where the globalist, where the empire controlled things. Just like

146
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:34,480
today, it can only be made in China because of regulations here that make it impossible

147
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,480
to be competitive.

148
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:40,080
Well, back then, they just outright outlawed it. This is why our forebears were willing

149
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:46,560
to lose everything and die because they were sick of literally being spit on by the royals.

150
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:51,540
And now government with the red carpets and the officials and the titles. I mean, I saw

151
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:56,780
Dianne Feinstein and all of her minions up there yesterday with all of the traitor police

152
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:59,920
chiefs or the big city crime syndicates that they brought in.

153
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,680
And they had two cordons in front of the guns going, we have to have two cordons in front

154
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:08,880
of this. None of the media could even walk by the assault weapons, the semi-autos, because

155
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,960
they're so dangerous. I actually have CNN saying this, we're gonna play the clip later.

156
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:16,120
Just total mind control, talking to us like we're three years old, saying the boogeyman's

157
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:21,400
over there. And Feinstein saying, I got a special waiver to even have these unloaded

158
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,400
guns here.

159
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,640
Like, they're so deadly. Again, I've always told you they have these sitcoms and dramas

160
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:30,540
based in New York where guns are banned. Where everybody sees the image of guns being illegal

161
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:34,720
and people going to jail for having guns to wear a carpet cleaners in your house, sees

162
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:39,000
a gun case and calls the police in Texas or Arizona.

163
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,820
This happens all the time. And the future, they're saying Homeland Security will respond

164
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:48,820
to any reports of even legal guns and go ahead and take them to, quote, make sure you're

165
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:53,240
not a criminal and then make you go through psychiatric evaluation if anyone calls on

166
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,560
you saying you have guns.

167
00:14:54,560 --> 00:15:00,560
This has all been announced, okay, so they know what they're doing. Behind two cordons,

168
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:08,940
we have the guns, they're so deadly. And these police chiefs say, ban them. And they themselves,

169
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:13,520
the New York Police Department, it's in the news right here in my stack, is lobbying to

170
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:18,760
have a new bill passed so they can keep their guns when they retire.

171
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:24,840
Unbelievably wicked criminals, vicious, hateful. And they say in these quotes, we've gotta

172
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:30,320
protect ourselves from criminals once we retire. There's a quote in the Huffington Post, the

173
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:35,000
irony is not lost on anybody saying, well, I mean, once we retire, we gotta have guns

174
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
to protect ourselves.

175
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:43,400
The criminals are still gonna have guns. Really? The criminals are still gonna have, you're

176
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:51,960
gonna have guns because you're the new royalty. You're the officials. You're the authorities,

177
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:58,720
not the servants, not the peace officers. You are the law enforcement officers and the

178
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:03,280
movies and the culture show nothing but the citizens groveling to the police.

179
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:08,240
Now, I'm gonna get to the TSA checkpoints where I live. See, the army was out a few

180
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:13,760
months ago. And Austinites should just rise up and go to the city council and the state

181
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:20,080
capital. This is all illegal. I want them out. This is illegal. And it's all getting

182
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,680
you ready. Why are they getting you ready for trips on the streets and TSA checkpoints?

183
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:30,560
I mean, down the street from me, on the road, searching people. Illegally, violation of

184
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:37,920
the Fourth Amendment, Tenth Amendment, Ninth Amendment. Why are they doing this?

185
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:42,320
Ladies and gentlemen, because they're criminals. They're collapsing the whole society and they

186
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,480
know they're all going to jail if they don't totally take over and arrest their opposition.

187
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,680
They've stolen tens of trillions of derivatives. The people running things make Ken Lay look

188
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:59,040
like a choir boy, an angel, literally. They are total ruthless mafia and they know that

189
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,040
we're waking up to them.

190
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:05,040
They know there's a 9% approval rating. New evidence has come out on CNN that I'm gonna

191
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:08,840
be airing tonight. That's all I've got to say concerning the Sandy Hook shooting. You

192
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,840
know I have questions about it. I always do. They have a history of staging these things.

193
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:15,880
So I believe and know people were killed there from the evidence we have. But there was definitely

194
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,600
all the signs this is being managed.

195
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,480
In fact, now it's pretty conclusive. I'm gonna air that tonight. I'm shaken to my core right

196
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:28,600
now. I mean, again, every instinct I've got is to flee this country right now. And I know

197
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:33,140
others are bad as well. But I mean, this country is gonna be the center of the nastiest stuff

198
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:37,120
the world has ever seen if these crooks get their way.

199
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:41,640
And all of you that serve the system, you're gonna wish later you'd done something. The

200
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:47,440
prosperity, everything, it's gone. It's gonna be totally gone, like oxygen out of the room.

201
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:55,040
I saw footage this morning when I got up at about 6 AM at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com

202
00:17:55,040 --> 00:18:01,480
that Paul Watson did an article on that really hurt me. Now I've had the people on charge

203
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:06,560
with life in prison for filming cops in public in Illinois.

204
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:11,240
Courts throw it out, state appeals, they wanna put you in jail for life for filming them.

205
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:15,600
This is an upscale neighborhood, the footage up at infowars.com. The neighbors friends

206
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:23,000
with the attractive redheaded housewife. And the police are going over their fence, putting

207
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,560
in the smart meter, and she goes, look, wireless makes my son sick.

208
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:31,920
We've discovered this, I've discovered it, it's certainly happening. But regardless,

209
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:35,920
the things spy on you on record and tie into all the new electronics, they admit that,

210
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:40,560
that are designed so they tie into it. They brag about this. And the police look like

211
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:51,800
total scary goons. And they are now charging her with resisting police for talking to her,

212
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,920
I've got the affidavit.

213
00:18:53,920 --> 00:19:00,720
And they're charging her for eavesdropping, and they arrested her. They came back and

214
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,880
said we saw that on YouTube, you didn't have a right to film me in public while they film

215
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,660
us and put smart meters on the spy on us. And break the law crossing their property

216
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:14,360
to put this on their house, while she's telling them don't do it.

217
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:21,440
And then the police chief of the town, I have it all listed here, it's also the Chicago

218
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:26,600
Tribune, they're reporting it like it's good, came and arrested the neighbor who was there,

219
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:31,760
her friend called her. The woman's barefooted in the cold, cuz her neighbor called her and

220
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,560
she's like, please, you don't have a right to be on my property.

221
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:40,840
The cops just pushed past her, bust open the fence, go in, they're placing it. The woman's

222
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:45,760
standing on the street filming and they imagine the police came and arrested her. Next, they're

223
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:51,560
going to disappear us and they want life in prison for the woman. Life in prison, we have

224
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:56,560
links to them, life in prison for filming them on the sidewalk.

225
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:00,760
Now folks, tell me we're not living in a FEMA camp.

226
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:05,600
Coming back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive? From natural disasters

227
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:10,160
like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought, to the family hardships brought on

228
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:15,280
by a disastrous economy. Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything. At eFoods

229
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,360

230

231
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:29,560
wrote, almost all the grocery stores are closed, but I managed to get my eFoods just in time

232
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:34,320
to be able to help my sister and niece. It is better to be prepared 10 years too early

00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,920

245
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,040
Do you know how much the dollar has lost in its value against other currencies in the

246
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:09,320
last 90 days? Ever think about how inflation will change your life, your savings, your

247
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:14,960
retirement plans? Remember inflation in Zimbabwe, Argentina, the Weimar Republic? Put another

248
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:20,960
way. Who cares if your investments go up 10% but you lose 40% of your purchasing power?

249
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:25,640
Gold is the only monetary asset as no one else's liability. Gold still buys the same

250
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:30,580
amount of stuff it always did. Gold does not require trust in a third party. You can possess

251
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:35,560
it in your hand. You can take it with you. Gold is real money. Gold is honest money.

255
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:05,740
Is 2013 your year to achieve more? More vitality? More health? More well-being? Hi, this is

256
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:10,720
Pastor Jenny. For 25 years, I spent my life's work teaching others how to achieve more.

257
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:16,440
But in 2010, I got a lesson of my own about RNA drops. I learned that there are millions

258
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:21,120
of gene switches latent in every single cell of my body that are waiting for an activator.

259
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:26,220
I learned by taking RNA drops, I could begin to activate that power in my cells and achieve

260
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:30,520
the more that I desire. I'd like to share what I discovered with you and send you a

261
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:36,400
free 30-day supply of RNA drops valued at $50 for just the cost of shipping and handling.

262

264
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:12,520
Ladies and gentlemen, we even have video of it. Alex Jones here back live at 5,500 plus

265
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:17,680
major hotels in the US. We have the press releases up there from the companies. They

266
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:21,400
are now announcing what we first showed you about two years ago with the FEMA training

267
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:24,220
videos for TSA.

268
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:29,600
Where you walk around the hotel and it says, look for terrorists, report suspicious things.

269
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:34,200
Or you go on the Walmarts and there's the telescreens. They're now going in everywhere.

270
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:38,600
And when you go up, not just to get a rent car, but to check in, they ask you, who you

271
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:43,840
coming to see? What's going on? They are entering it into a Homeland Security database. So imagine

272
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,100
everything is a police conversation.

273
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:54,920
This makes the East German Stasi look like cavemen when it came to spying. And it's all

274
00:24:54,920 --> 00:25:00,120
happening quote for Al-Qaeda, who our government publicly now runs. Do I get an apology from

275
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:03,240
everybody? Britain's and other westerners told to leave Benghazi after imminent terror

276
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,960
threat by Al-Qaeda, the same Al-Qaeda they gave Libya.

277
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:10,000
And they think you're so dumb you won't remember that. Now they're saying we've got to have

278
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,720
checkpoints on highways as I predicted. In fact, I have that because Al-Qaeda may have

279
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:17,680
gotten heat seeking missiles out of Libya. I don't even have time to toot my horn. How

280
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:21,720
many times I told you in the last year since they got all those heat seekers, 10,000 plus

281
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:25,940
of them, they'd be saying that now they're saying heat seeking missiles.

282
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:29,880
Our government gives them the heat seeking missiles and now is gonna run checkpoints

283
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:35,700
where I live. And I will not put up with it, you terrorist. I know you did it. And again,

284
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,840
it's not, quote, even our government. Most of the government's compartmentalized. It's

285
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:43,040
the foreign mega banks. This is how they're gonna take over. They tell you it's for Al-Qaeda,

286
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,040
it's for the American people.

287
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:48,080
Now, Illinois is the worst about this. We're on several stations in Illinois, including

288
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:53,680
Chicago. And I see these videos. We've had people on from Illinois who've been charged

289
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:58,400
with life imprisonment, got thrown out by the judge. But the state came and did a brief

290
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:04,080
and said, no, we want this guy in jail. Now this woman calls her neighbor, she comes up

291
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,600
with her filming. If you're a radio listener, I'm gonna narrate it for you.

292
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:13,920
They go, a very nice neighborhood. It looks like they're $500,000 houses or more. Nice,

293
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:20,440
and again, my point is nice, attractive, conservative looking women. I mean, no one's safe, folks,

294
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:25,120
okay? And the police look like total goons. They have that arrogant sly look, like we

295
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,120
do whatever we want.

296
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:30,380
They have the look of gangsters. I mean, I've been to towns where they got good police.

297
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:34,320
You can instantly see they're good guys. They're baring how they act. They're humble, but

298
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:40,720
they're serious. These are thugs, in my view, just watching them. And then they go across,

299
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:46,120
violate her Fourth Amendment, put it in, the video's up at Infowars.com, it's so incredible.

300
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:55,560
It's gotta go viral. And her neighbor films it for her and their friends talking from

301
00:26:55,560 --> 00:27:03,560
the sidewalk. And they're now charging her with, well, I'll read the article in a moment.

302
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:07,080
Here is just some of the audio for radio listeners and video for people watching us right now

303
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:10,760
at Infowarsnews.com, here it is.

304
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:14,240
Here's UPA installers crossing over locked fences.

305
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,760
Climbing them over. Against consent.

306
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,760
Bolt cutters.

307
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:25,520
They are going onto people's properties with police permission. They are crossing.

308
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,840
The permission? Well, the government's gone.

309
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,240
Laura, do you give consent to have this-

310
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:35,600
No, absolutely not. This is putting my child in harm's way. My child has a chronic illness

311
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:40,560
and it could affect her illness and make it worse. And I absolutely don't agree.

312
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:44,080
Can I step away from the fence for a minute?

313
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,080
Why?

314
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,080
So I can get through.

315
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:51,280
Okay, so police are now crossing locked fences without homeowner's consent.

316
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,440
Just do whatever they want.

317
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,640
And opening. Laura, do you give consent?

318
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,960
Those look like million dollar houses, actually.

319
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:58,960
82 million dollar.

320
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,960
Protecting the city. It's like a dictatorship.

321
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,080
Guarantee these women are listeners. We're gonna get them on.

322
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,680
Officer, do you feel comfortable with what you're doing?

323
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,680
No, he doesn't.

324
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:14,960
We're already saying they're not gonna be putting smart meters on your house, ladies.

325
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,240
So, Laura, you're the homeowner? Those two men that are on your property-

326
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,480
They take what they want. They always do in history.

327
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,540
Knowing that my daughter is chronically ill and this could affect her illness.

328
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:29,600
That's enough. The whole video's up there. There's a lot more of it. And you can go read

329
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:33,600
the article here. The Chicago Tribune is very excited about wanting to put this woman in

330
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,600
jail.

331
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:38,880
Illinois, cuz that'll teach the slaves. Cuz people are part of the ruling class. This

332
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:47,200
is fun to route us. It says, Illinois, citizens still being arrested for filming police despite

333
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,560
court ruling which blocked unconstitutional law. So in your own property, you don't film

334
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,560
God.

335
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:56,500
Illinois citizens are still being arrested for recording police officers despite a Seventh

336
00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:01,080
Circuit Court of Appeals ruling last year that blocked the enforcement of the law on

337
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:05,600
the grounds that it was unconstitutional. They say public filming is eavesdropping.

338
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:11,800
Following yesterday's story concerning residents of Naperville who attempted to resist utility

339
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:16,480
workers by speaking to them, invading their private property to install so-called smart

340
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,960
meters which have been linked with health issues. It emerged that one of the Refuseniks,

341
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:26,760
Malia Kim-Vandis, was arrested on attempted eavesdropping charges for recording police

342
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,000
officers during the incident.

343
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,920
They charge her for other stuff too. The irony of citizens being arrested for supposedly

344
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:36,840
eavesdropping on cops in public where there is no expectation of privacy while simultaneously

345
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:41,440
the government forcibly installs devices on people's property on record that do eavesdrop

346
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:45,520
and spy on everything you're doing in your home is incredible. We'll be right back with

347
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,960
a lot more It Gets Worse.

348
00:30:45,520 --> 00:31:00,760

369
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:05,320
There's an old saying in Tennessee, I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee, that

370
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:15,160
says, fool me once, shame on, shame on you. Fool me, we can't get fooled again.

371
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:21,160
He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side. You're listening

372
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,160
to Alex Jones.

373
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:41,200
All right, we're going to be joined here in just a moment. He's sitting around next to

374
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,200
me by Dr. Jerome Corsi, a WorldNetDaily best-selling author, worked with the State Department and

375
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:50,640
other intelligence agencies. He can certainly speak to Benghazi and the whitewash there.

376
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:56,480
Several zones that Communist Chinese are setting up, Inside America, NAFTA and GATT, expanding

377
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,360
the North American Union, the gun grabbing that's going on. We're gonna talk about all

378
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,900
of it with him in just a moment.

379
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:06,960
But first off, I said I would announce this a few weeks ago, I've just been too busy,

380
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:16,360
but it is the biggest contest we've ever had. And it is for $115,000, our new film contest,

381
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:23,240
$115,000, first place $100,000 cash prize, second place $10,000, third place $5,000.

382
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:29,040
And then you will be in a pool in the running to have Infowars.com and our news operation

383
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:33,920
finance your film to then put it out not just on the Internet for free like I've done with

384
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:39,280
all my others, but what we've seen Dinesh D'Souza and others do, putting them in theaters.

385
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:43,020
Now I've always known how to do this. And it's not that I shrink from work, it's just

386
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:48,760
that I know the model, I have a lot of Hollywood contacts, as people know. And so that is going

387
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:54,160
to be the plan. Now they may shut everything down by then, but regardless, $100,000 sounds

388
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,380
like a lot of money and it is.

389
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:59,960
The biggest contest out there is Doritos, it's 100,000. So this is the biggest contest

390
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:06,440
next to Doritos, Twin Peaks up there. And with the other 15,000, it's the biggest. But

391
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:12,280
for the bang for the buck Liberty films that are put on YouTube, whether they're three

392
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:15,800
minutes or two hours, that's the rules between three and two hours long.

393
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:20,360
It can be history, it can be drama, it can be fiction, nonfiction, Gena 21, Second Amendment,

394
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:23,400
you name it. I'm gonna talk about that at the bottom of the next hour when Dr. Courtney

395
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:26,580
leaves us. He's with us for the rest of the hour and then half of the next hour. And I'll

396
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:31,160
play the special video announcement that will be posted in the next 30 minutes or so up

397
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,800
at Infowars.com.

398
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:41,000
I'll play that four minute announcement for everybody up at Infowars.com. So that press

399
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:49,280
release and more coming in T-minus about 56 minutes from now. That will go live at prisonplanet.com

400
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:55,120
and infowars.com. And again, for $100,000 or $115,000, they'll probably be 500 films

401
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,280
made. A couple hundred of them are gonna be excellent.

402
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,920
A few of them will be off the chart and it'll be a win-win. Everybody that enters is gonna

403
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:06,680
be a winner, cuz you get the word out about The Globalist. This is Operation All Revere.

404
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:11,040
And the Bombay doors are open. We're over The Globalist. We drop the bomb, the info

405
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:16,520
weapon, in T-minus 55 minutes and counting. We're gonna turn loose the power of the people.

406
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:22,640
This will be our 22nd contest. We've already paid out over $150,000 over the years of these

407
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:26,640
contests. We're gonna do that basically all in one fail swoop. And then you'll have a

408
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:32,080
chance to be part of the production of three films a year, big films and over a dozen smaller

409
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,080
films.

410
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:37,680
We've put everything into this fight. So keep buying the books, the videos, the t-shirts,

411
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:42,360
the propure water filters at infowarstore.com. Keep supporting our sponsors. Keep spreading

412
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:46,680
the word because we're taking those Federal Reserve notes in and turning it right back

413
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,880
against the enemy. Wars cost money.

414
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:53,480
And the reason we've been so successful is we have history, we're dogged, we're focused,

415
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:59,480
and we are putting the money back into the fight, not into private jets. Okay, so that's

416
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:06,240
what's happening here, ladies and gentlemen. Now, Dr. Jerome Corsi joins us here in studio.

417
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:10,920
He received a PhD from Harvard University in political science at 72. And he's also

418
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:15,000
currently a senior staff reporter for WorldNetDaily. He's had a whole bunch of number one best

419
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,960
sellers like Unfit for Command and others.

420
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:23,080
And again, he's had five number one New York Times best sellers, I guess. He's just amazing.

421
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:27,200
And he also worked in security and other highly classified areas for the State Department

422
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:32,760
and for unnamed intelligence agencies. And he joins us here to break down what's happening.

423
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:36,400
Doc, before we get into Benghazi, before we get into agenda 21, before we get into the

424
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:41,040
total rush that's happening and Feinstein saying titles of nobility to government people

425
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:45,600
to be exempt from gun laws even after they're out of office and police.

426
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:51,320
Before we get into all of that, what do you make of airport terror announcements now in

427
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:56,240
hotels, highway checkpoints here in Austin now looking for terrorists while the borders

428
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:00,200
are wide open? I mean, they are really accelerating things. What's happening?

429
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:04,480
Well, I think it's a whole clamp down, the whole decision by the government to get as

430
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:10,080
much information on the populace as they can get. I mean, you gotta remember, it wasn't

431
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:16,280
just the Nazis confiscated guns. The Nazis were experts in censuses and getting people

432
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:19,520
to tell them what they owned, where it was.

433
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:25,360
When the Nazis came to take the Jews away, they could say, where is that bracelet you

434
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:29,800
described in such and such a census? And you said you used to keep it in this drawer, where

435
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:33,680
is it now? I mean, it got down to that kind of specific information.

436
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,360
Everyone just loves submitting.

437
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:39,320
And submitting, people say, we gotta fill out all these forms, we gotta do all these

438
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:45,400
census reports. And by the way, Alex, I never worked as an employee of the government, I

439
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,400
worked with these agents.

440
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,400
You were a consultant.

441
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,800
Consultant, I just wanted to make that clear so people didn't think I was misrepresenting

442
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,360
anything I've done. I'm always precise on that.

443
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,600
And you've worked in finance for some of the big outfits.

444
00:38:55,600 --> 00:39:01,280
25 years in finance for banks around the world and still have all my securities and insurance

445
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,280
licenses.

446
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:05,760
Well, we know all the real agents actually aren't in the agencies.

447
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:10,940
It's better not to be in the agencies. But anyway, look, the whole purpose right now

448
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:17,680
is to collect information. My corporations, we just got forms coming from, I believe,

449
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:23,040
the Census Bureau or the Commerce Department, all kinds of detailed information.

450
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,640
My point was, you worked high level in the State Department in security. Tell folks,

451
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,640
since we never brought that up, what you did do in that area.

452
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:35,440
It was a period of time I was working with some top psychiatrists here, actually in Dallas.

453
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:39,620
And we went into the State Department and trained State Department personnel on hostage

454
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:45,400
survival techniques. This was right after the takeover of the embassy in Tehran.

455
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:52,520
I spent almost two years doing high level work on survival of terrorist incidents and

456
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:56,400
developed protocol for the State Department and the State Department employees around

457
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,400
the world.

458
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:02,020
A lot of that information is being used today. I developed a computer model that predicted

459
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:06,280
the outcome of terrorist events, published it in an international journal of conflict

460
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,640
resolution at Yale.

461
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:11,960
My point is, you can really speak to Benghazi. That's why I brought all this up. I mean,

462
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:14,400
we've even got General Boykin coming out. Let's get into that now.

463
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:19,640
Well, I mean, first of all, the Benghazi issue is one that we have to, first of all, figure

464
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:24,200
out what they were doing there. And what they were doing, as far as I can figure out, Stevens

465
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:29,000
and the others, is they were, it was another kind of fast and furious operation bringing

466
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,280
weapons into Libya.

467
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:35,600
With the ultimate intent, they were gonna end up with Al-Qaeda. And a lot of those weapons

468
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:40,600
today are ending up in Syria. The same weapons, if we could track them, I would believe the

469
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:44,360
weapons that were brought in by the US government through Libya-

470
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:47,620
Well, that's what the former head of Special Forces Boykin, General Boykin's saying.

471
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:53,680
I think some of them were used by the Mali Al-Qaeda terrorists in that attack. But if

472
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,160
we could find and track those weapons, you've got-

473
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:00,000
Why would the State Department want, because they had a huge weapons cash at that safe

474
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
house.

475
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Yes.

476
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,280
And then why would for eight hours the White House be caught lying? We now know, order

477
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:10,040
a stand down. Were they trying to get rid of people after the transaction? Or was it

478
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:13,680
a double cross by the Al-Qaeda security they hired to run Benghazi?

479
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:18,560
Well, see, first of all, I think there's so many games going on on this. First of all,

480
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:25,040
Stevens, you remember, came into Benghazi when Gaddafi was in power. He came in through

481
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,760
a cargo ship or something. He kind of snuck in.

482
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,760
Tripoli.

483
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:31,480
Yeah, Tripoli. He came into Tripoli, ended up in Benghazi.

484
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:33,060
Yeah, the Commando invasion.

485
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:41,600
And was funding and providing weapons to eliminate Gaddafi. So these people who ended up killing

486
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:48,200
Stevens were actually funded and gotten weapons to them and to their allies. But then now,

487
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:53,200
see, Stevens is turning on them. We realized we're missing maybe a million weapons. We

488
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:57,320
don't know where they are. And Stevens is trying to find out where those weapons are.

489
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:01,720
Al-Qaeda was taking and shipping those weapons into Syria. We're beginning to find out these

490
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:02,720
weapons are-

491
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,080
Well, of course, the West wants that. They're running the whole attack.

492
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:10,680
And in fact, it's the same thing as we did in Fast and Furious. We provided the weapons.

493
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:15,680
The weapons ended up in the hands of the gun cartels. Look, I just did this big expose

494
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:24,760
on HSBC Bank. HSBC Bank doing major money laundering for the Mexican drug cartels. They

495
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:30,920
just paid something like a billion dollars in fines on the information that we helped

496
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:31,920
to develop.

497
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:37,880
It comes to the final realization, look, we are the drug cartels. You don't money launder

498
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:43,600
a billion dollars of money, bring it to the Tijuana branch in $100 bills and having it

499
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:46,640
put into an account without the federal government knowing about it.

500
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:52,320
When I take $1,000 out of the bank, they act suspicious and ask me what I'm doing. I get

501
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:56,200
the big argument with them. It's none of your business. I mean, they won't even let Gerald

502
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,640
Salente get 10,000 out.

503
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:02,040
The idea that we're preventing terrorism, and we're running the terrorist operation.

504
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:07,580
They get the law to know everything about your business and collect the data.

505
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:12,300
So just like Fast and Furious was to be blamed on the Second Amendment to take that away,

506
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:16,300
they give Al-Qaeda all these missiles, let them take out the Syrians, then we gotta take

507
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:18,880
your rights cuz there's 10,000 heat-seeking missiles missing.

508
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:24,000
Exactly, and we've gotta make sure that we clamp down on guns in America because look

509
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
at the violent level.

510
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:30,200
And now they're saying Homeland Security is now for guns, not for Al-Qaeda. It's for the

511
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:33,800
gun owners, it's for the libertarians, it's for the conservatives, it's for the returning

512
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:34,800
veterans.

513
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:39,600
See, we're gonna be defined as anyone who doesn't go along with the agenda, anyone who

514
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:44,480
objects, anyone who raises questions, immediately you're on the suspect list.

515
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:48,840
How do we respond to that? Because again, I mean, you've been there at the highest levels

516
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:52,900
of the system in banking and in consulting and everything. You've written books that

517
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:56,640
brought down your major presidential candidates. You're a big insider. You don't say that,

518
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:00,100
but let's just admit you are, Dr. Corsi, Jerome Corsi.

519
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:04,840
Where are we going? Cuz I see this as a Vichy French sympathizer takeover where the foreign

520
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:10,080
banks are like the Vichy French. The generals stand down, they turn America over to it,

521
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,920
and that's what I see. I mean, they admit it.

522
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:17,500
Well, first of all, Alex, you're doing a great job. And we at WND, we work with you, we support

523
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:22,760
you, we think you're doing a great job. We're on the same team. The first job is you're

524
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:27,320
exposing, you're calling the agenda and you're opening people's eyes.

525
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,600
So what is the agenda? I mean, do you concur with my analysis?

526
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:34,300
The agenda, absolutely. The agenda is complete domination of the American people. It's totalitarianism.

527
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:35,300
This is the-

528
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:37,160
And there's no doubt now. It's 100% naked.

529
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:41,760
This is the left, it's most bald ever running to the finish line.

530
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:45,560
I mean, yeah, I mean, every instinct I've got is get out of the country.

531
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:52,240
They're saying, next we'll take your property. I mean, the whole agenda here, collectivism.

532
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,480
You don't own that. The government-

533
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:55,480
You didn't build that.

534
00:44:55,480 --> 00:45:01,440
We didn't build that. We own it. We need this to redistribute it. The whole plan of getting

535
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,440
people out of their houses-

536
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:07,260
Okay, well, I've studied the 1917 takeover, as you have. From everything I know, they're

537
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:11,080
using that plan. And I'm not just saying that for theatrics, you've got the floor. I want

538
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:14,660
you to break that down. From everything I'm seeing, they're planning to try to start a

539
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:16,880
civil war and call him Lincoln.

540
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:24,400
It is always the same plan. The plan is disarm the people. The plan is call the people the

541
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:30,160
terrorists. Get information on the people. And then divide, find out which is the group.

542
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:34,360
Is it gonna be the Jews? Who's it gonna be this time? There's a scapegoat group that

543
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:38,280
has to be collected. It's gonna be the white militia.

544
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:39,280
They're now saying that.

545
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:44,280
It's gonna be anyone white who still believes in Jesus Christ and professes religious.

546
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:46,520
Wow, they actually say that.

547
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:47,520
Sure.

548
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:48,520
No, it's in the manuals.

549
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:51,720
This is the plan. These are the people that are gonna march-

550
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:56,720
No, no, no, no. The peer's pressure thing article actually said, let them get ready.

551
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:02,360
We're coming for you. And the communist Chinese are gonna help. That's Newsweek. It says Newsweek

552
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:05,280
on the byline is saying they're that confident.

553
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:09,400
Well, look, the whole plan of the United States being bankrupt. I just wrote a short book

554
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:13,800
on the power pivot theory. That it's a plan to bankrupt the United States.

555
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:14,800
Yeah.

556
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:19,320
And with the Chinese owning as much of our debt as the Federal Reserve owns, they're

557
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:25,160
one and two and competitors. China is saying already, we'll take equity instead of the

558
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:31,680
debt. We'll manage your ports. We'll take land. We'll have occupation zones within the

559
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:34,440
United States that we create as free trade zones.

560
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:41,840
I wrote an article this week in WND where China is buying oil rights in the United States

561
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:47,080
that George W. Bush prevented China from doing with the UNICAL deal saying it was a national

562
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:48,920
security threat.

563
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:54,440
Now today under Obama, China's signing left and right, oil and natural gas deals. Well,

564
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:56,960
we're still dependent on foreign oil.

565
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:01,000
He won't let us develop, does everything he can to block it, while giving huge swaths

566
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
to the-

567
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
China.

568
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,680
China just bought the biggest oil fields in Texas, hundreds of thousands of different

569
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:10,080
acres. I can drive 20 miles and show you Chinese owned areas.

570
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:14,600
And China just made a big deal, bought one of the major companies in Canada, which owns

571
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:23,120
rigs in the Gulf of Mexico, in US territory. China is going to own and operate those rigs.

572
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:30,040
China is gonna be essentially producing oil out of resources while we're buying oil and

573
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:33,680
natural gas, especially oil, on foreign markets.

574
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:38,720
It makes no sense at all. Why are we buying foreign oil and letting the Chinese? Well,

575
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,640
because again, the plan-

576
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:44,440
That's why they gave them the Panama Canal. That's why they give them all the industry.

577
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:46,200
That's why, I mean, this is so diabolical.

578
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:50,520
Take a look at this little ebook I wrote. I wrote two ebooks, I think are very important.

579
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:56,440
One is on Saul Alinsky, the evil genius behind Obama. And the second was on the coward pivot

580
00:47:56,440 --> 00:48:02,200
theory, which is the plan, Obama's plan to bankrupt the United States. That's what it's

581
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:03,200
called.

582
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:09,200
These two sociologists came up with the conclusion the only way to transform America into a socialist

583
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:15,040
state was to bring it to its knees economically by overloading the welfare of the welfare

584
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,440
state with obligations that could not be met.

585
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:22,800
That's the plan. Look at the Daily Peace article. It says we need the Communist Chinese government

586
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:26,760
to tell us what to do. This is globalism. We've got to get Americans ready to have our

587
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:30,000
TV foreign owned like current TV.

588
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,800
Somewhere Alex Jones is readying his flamethrower. Let him. And they go on to say we're gonna

589
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:40,920
use the minorities and basically racial division and we're gonna use women. They're actually

590
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:45,880
admitting what Rush Limbaugh finally said yesterday, they want a race war in this country.

591
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:53,640
Look at how the campaign was run. Obama ran a race war campaign. Saul Alinsky, the rich

592
00:48:53,640 --> 00:49:00,360
are not paying their fair share. So you flame the economic resentment, get all the minorities

593
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:05,160
to feel the white majority has stolen your money. They made you-

594
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:08,960
And have Obama raise taxes on poor people, so they're hurting even worse.

595
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:11,640
Well, and again, it's part of the plan to bankrupt everybody.

596
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:12,640
Yeah, exactly.

597
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:18,760
Because under the lie that he wasn't gonna raise taxes, he did raise taxes, 87% of the

598
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:19,760
workers in the country.

599
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:22,280
Yeah, exactly. It's so diabolical. It is so diabolical.

600
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:23,720
Lying, lying, lying all the time.

601
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:27,720
So how do we stop them? Because I mean, this is a real Soviet style takeover.

602
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:28,720
Yes, in fact-

603
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:32,480
John Brown just came out and said Obama only is faithful to the Soviet Constitution.

604
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:37,480
In fact, go back and ask, what has Obama done for the African Americans? Look at the unemployment

605
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:39,880
rate among African Americans. What has he done-

606
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:40,880
They've been hurt the worst.

607
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:45,080
The worst. Look, what has he done for the youth who have voted for him? Highest unemployment

608
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:51,040
rate, the slimmest chances of jobs of any generation that we've ever had in America.

609
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:53,880
These are the Obama zombies that in college-

610
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:58,000
And he re-legalized US funding for basically forced abortions in China, where they give

611
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,280
the women money if they get aborted.

612
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:06,640
And kill the babies left and right, force women to have abortions in China. China, look,

613
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:11,120
you go try to bring a Bible and profess the religion of Jesus Christ in China, you'll

614
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:12,840
be in prison. China-

615
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:17,680
But I mean, Doc, even though I know all this stuff we're going to break, I can't believe

616
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:18,680
it's really happening.

617
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:23,560
The Bank of China has had meetings with the United States government. The plan is set

618
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:28,840
for China to transfer its debt into equity, own parts of the United States, manage-

619
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:29,840
That's official.

620
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:31,400
It's official. The meetings have happened.

621
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:34,280
That's why they said in the People's Daily a month ago, you will take the guns.

622
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:35,640
The meetings have happened.

623
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:38,120
So they want the property, they know we're going to fight.

624
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:41,280
And China wants to disarm the United States before this plan is implemented.

625
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:43,960
We are being conquered by the globalists leveraging China.

626
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:47,520
Absolutely. China wants us to have no weapons.

627
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:51,020
I mean, this is so- and I want to talk about the military.

628
00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:55,520
It's a plan. The Howard Piven theory, Obama's plan to bankrupt-

629
00:50:55,520 --> 00:51:00,720
A Soviet globalist comming plan. We'll be back.

630
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:04,460
If you've ever wanted one of our best selling generators, but we're waiting for an offer

631
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:09,200
so crazy you couldn't refuse, then you're not going to want to miss this exciting message.

632
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:15,240
Here's why. Our solar generators provide life-saving electrical power. And unlike gas generators,

633
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:20,320
solar generators run quietly, emit no fumes, and produce electricity from the sun. So when

634
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:23,480
the lights go out, you'll always have the power you need.

635
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:28,800
Now here's the best part. Every year we accumulate a few solar generators that we just can't

636
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:34,520
sell as new. We put them in a special spot in our warehouse, and we discount them heavily

637
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:39,080
at the end of each year. We call them scratch and dent units, but they're really just like

638
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:44,760
new. Each unit comes with a full factory warranty and special bonuses you just won't believe.

639
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:51,240
Don't wait. They go fast. Go to scratchanddentsolar.com. That's scratchanddentsolar.com. For the craziest

640
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:57,240

650
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:04,960
It's time for a home security quiz. Answer this. What effective home security device

651
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:09,280
is smaller than a coffee cup fakes out burglars into thinking someone is home at your house

652
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:14,280
while you're away, plugs into any wall outlet, is recommended by many police departments,

653
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:21,240
and sells for less than $35? Yes, it's fake TV. This year, about one in every 50 US homes

654
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:26,000
will have a break-in, with burglars usually picking the easy target, a dark house that

655
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:31,040
looks like no one is home. Fake TV is a small electronic security device that makes it look

656
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:36,440
like someone is home watching TV by simulating the light from a real TV. It's like a lamp

657
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:42,040
on a timer, but far more convincing. And for only $34.95, fake TV could be the difference

658
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:47,620
between coming home to a secure house or one that's been ransacked. Go to faketv.com or

659
00:53:47,620 --> 00:54:00,840
call 1-877-5FAKETV. That's 877-532-5388, or go to faketv.com. Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.

660
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:08,720
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now.

661
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:12,240
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now.

662
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:16,560
Folks, the reason I keep talking about since yesterday, this Piers Pressure article that

663
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:21,160
I came out January 21st, I didn't see till the 24th, is that I haven't had time to read

664
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:26,520
it on air yet. And it says, yeah, we're getting rid of America, we're getting rid of sovereignty.

665
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:29,880
We're going under globalization, new world order, and the gun owners are gonna have to

666
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:35,000
turn their guns in. And the communist Chinese, thank God other governments are gonna help.

667
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:39,120
I mean, it's everything I saw in the weatherman trials, going back and seeing the old footage

668
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:43,440
where they plan to bring in the Chinese and all this. And it sounds crazy, here we are

669
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:48,000
30, 40 years later, and they're really gonna try it. I mean, and I believe they're gonna

670
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,720
fail, but there's gonna be a civil war.

671
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:54,520
Ron Paul agreed last week with us on air. Countless others, every analyst I've talked

672
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:59,740
to, let me ask you that, Dr. Corsi, best selling author here in studio with us. Hey, how are

673
00:54:59,740 --> 00:55:04,680
things going for them? They're teamed up with China, that much is clear. Do you think they're

674
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:07,440
able to actually execute this?

675
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:12,680
How do we defeat them? What is the timeframe? Well, first of all, exposing them is critical.

676
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:17,840
What you're doing every day is critical. The timeframe is now, it's immediate. The plan

677
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:23,100
to bankrupt America is ongoing today. Cloward Piven theory is in-

678
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:26,120
22 billion to ship General Motors overseas.

679
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:31,760
Not to read the Cloward Piven theory, I wrote it out in this little ebook. And it explains

680
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:37,120
you bankrupt the United States by overloading welfare with demands that welfare can never

681
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:43,020
meet, including Obamacare, including, wait, they'll take the student tuitions and forgive

682
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:44,020
all those loans.

683
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:45,480
It's all designed to bankrupt.

684
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:51,080
All designed to bankrupt. China has had meetings, China wants assets. And see, the New World

685
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:56,640
Order people say, well, China's the future. Why? Cuz China's communist, but they combine

686
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:59,520
capitalism under communism and a model-

687
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:00,920
And the elites are exempt.

688
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:06,360
Then the elites are exempt. The elites get to lead a privileged life with weapons, go

689
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:11,040
into any federal building. What do you find? You find armed guards, you go through metal

690
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:16,000
detectors, all your property is searched. The federal government's gonna be well protected

691
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,960
and they're gonna have weapons everywhere.

692
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:22,840
And they're gonna take our weapons because China does not wanna take over the United

693
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:24,520
States with an armed citizen.

694
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:29,040
It's unbelievable. And they're planning to just have a slow motion red dawn with all

695
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:32,960
the infra, and give China tax incentives, as they've announced, in these free trade

696
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:34,560
zones where no one can compete.

697
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:40,440
Look, I wrote about, you've even got Governor Perry back with Sintra rebuilding the parts

698
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:41,920
of the trans Texas corridor.

699
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:43,000
That was super highway.

700
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,960
Super highways. They're coming back in with toll roads. They're under the radar. They

701
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:48,520
signed something like $20 billion.

702
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:51,400
Everything is bankrupt. How is it going for them?

703
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:56,400
Done incrementally so you can't see that it's happening in little pieces. It's going well.

704
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:02,840
I mean, Obama reelected, they've got a socialist agenda set out. They got the Republicans on

705
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:08,240
the run. What's gonna stop them is the Second Amendment and the American people finally

706
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:10,280
waking up and saying no.

707
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:15,680
And Alex, you're playing a big role in this. Every day getting the information, we at WND,

708
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:19,800
every day getting the information in front of the people, the truth. Look, I just wrote

709
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:26,360
about the fact of oil. We are selling to the Chinese oil rights throughout the United States.

710
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:27,360
For nothing.

711
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:32,280
For nothing. And George W Bush would not, remember, UNICAL was gonna be taken over by

712
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:33,280
I think 2005.

713
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:36,120
And that's what government land is all about, so they can just give it away.

714
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:37,120
They can give it away.

715
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:41,320
I remember 15 years ago reading about the UN World Heritage sites where they admitted

716
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:45,300
the buffer zones, hundreds of thousands of square miles around it, was being pledged

717
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:47,680
to the national debt. And who owns the debt?

718
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:49,240
China wants to manage the ports.

719
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:50,240
China.

720
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:54,000
China wants to manage the ports. They're managing the ports right now.

721
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,680
No, that's the deal. We'll use your dollars for slave goods our slaves make with suicide

722
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:04,160
nets around the factories. But you give us the Long Beach and the Panama Canal and the

723
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:05,720
infrastructure and the oil.

724
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:08,720
The Panama Canal, China is. They're managing the zone.

725
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:09,720
Everything, everything.

726
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:15,940
Tanzania. They're ready to manage Los Angeles. And they want free trade zones in the United

727
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:18,880
States where communist Chinese can come in and set up business.

728
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:19,880
This is a takeover.

729
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:25,760
It's a takeover. It's a step-by-step takeover. And it's happening. And our debt is giving

730
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:29,240
China the leverage they need to demand assets.

731
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:33,240
And in the global issues, our military, what's left of it, has the leverage point to keep

732
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:34,840
the commie Chinese in line.

733
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:37,360
We don't have to have a military. China has one.

734
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:43,320
We'll be right back.

735
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:50,800
This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.

736
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:55,660
Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive? From natural disasters

737
00:58:55,660 --> 00:59:00,240
like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on

738
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:05,200
by a disastrous economy. Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything. At eFoods

739
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:09,420

741
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:16,080
After Hurricane Sandy, Danny from New York City wrote, Almost all the grocery stores

742
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:20,900
are closed, but I managed to get my eFoods just in time to be able to help my sister

749
00:59:50,160 --> 01:00:07,120
Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. Big brother, mainstream

750
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:16,440
media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN

751
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:23,640
Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.

752
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:33,200
Big things afoot here in Texas. You know, Dr. Corsi, I'm noticing there's like a gathering

753
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:38,000
in Texas. It's also happening in other states like New Hampshire, but everybody is really

754
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:42,640
moving to Texas and the globalists see Texas as the resistance to their new world order

755
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:46,600
takeover. And I know they've got to get the guns, but I think as the founders said, you

756
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:49,840
won't need the Second Amendment until they try to take it. As Thomas Jefferson said,

757
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:54,480
elaborate on what you mean by the Second Amendment is going to save us. And you were telling

758
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:57,880
me during the break, people are finally starting to get it. This has been great banter we're

759
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:58,880
having.

760
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:02,840
Well, I think, first of all, the broadcast you're doing, at WND, getting the word out.

761
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:07,500
People are understanding that, oh, it's a conspiracy theory. It's not a conspiracy.

762
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:12,880
It's a conscious plan to bankrupt the United States, conscious plan to take away our freedoms.

763
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:18,760
You get the Patriot Act coming in after 9-11. You get now the, you know, terrorism is expanding,

764
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:24,160
so we've got to be able to take guns away, school killings. All these fear elements end

765
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:30,440
up in taking fundamental rights from the American people while we're being indebted to China.

766
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:36,360
And China wants the assets. The new world order people, communist socialists, say China's

767
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:41,600
the future cuz China is communist, but they've figured out, you know, the Obama people-

768
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:43,080
Well, they're really just slave masters.

769
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:44,480
Capitalism, they're slave masters.

770
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:47,840
Yeah, yeah, communism for the slaves, palaces for the controllers.

771
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:51,720
I mean, you know, Obama gets, you know, multimillion dollar vacations.

772
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:55,400
$10 million vacations, red carpets, they're the new Hollywood.

773
01:01:55,400 --> 01:02:00,680
And celebrities, and, you know, so does Nancy Pelosi. You go into a federal building, you're

774
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:05,360
gonna have to go through a metal detector. Your property is gonna be looked at. They're

775
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:10,200
all gonna be protected, the federal government, by guns and weapons. And by the way, they're

776
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:14,320
not part of Obamacare. Nobody in the Senate and the House is part of Obamacare. Nobody

777
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:18,280
in the Senate and the House will be part of any gun restrictions. When China comes in-

778
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:19,280
Unbelievable.

779
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:20,280
China comes in-

780
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:21,280
Unbelievable.

781
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:26,160
And the Trans-Texas Corridor was the first salvo in this. And out of it, look, China

782
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:31,120
is still managing the Panama Canal. They're managing these ports in Mexico like Lazaro

783
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:36,960
Cardenas in Manzanilla. China wants ports. The Bank of China has met with the federal

784
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:43,600
government. They've said, we want assets now for our debt. We'll get it. And the coward

785
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:49,280
pivot theory drives this. Because the coward pivot, two sociologists who had a plan, they

786
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:57,160
bankrupt New York in the 70s with this idea, overloading welfare. So capitalism crashes.

787
01:02:57,160 --> 01:03:01,840
You blame capitalism. You reconstruct socialism. Let the Chinese come in and show us how to

788
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:07,100
do it. The Chinese understand capitalism the way it works. And we're just being prepared

789
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:08,100
for it.

790
01:03:08,100 --> 01:03:15,040
The discussion today in the Senate about guns is to sensitize people. Remember, same sex

791
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:20,960
marriage. 20 years ago, people were offended. Now everybody's desensitized. The same with

792
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:28,120
a gun takeover. You introduce the idea. You show Newton, all these school. You wanna protect

793
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:31,940
the schools, put armed guards in them. That's what they do in the federal buildings. It

794
01:03:31,940 --> 01:03:32,940
works for the federal.

795
01:03:32,940 --> 01:03:39,700
Federal buildings are not no gun zones. The federal troops have federal officers in every

796
01:03:39,700 --> 01:03:40,700
House and Senate-

797
01:03:40,700 --> 01:03:43,640
But how do you beat it when they've got all the illegal aliens voting and everything?

798
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:48,560
What they don't have is you've got the people of the United States, those left in America

799
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:51,600
who understand that the founding fathers created-

800
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:55,840
We have to get aggressive and realize how much trouble we're in and go after them politically,

801
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:58,040
legally. People have got to make this a full-time deal.

802
01:03:58,040 --> 01:03:59,040
And take it seriously.

803
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:00,040
Yeah, this isn't a joke.

804
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:06,680
It's not a joke. I mean, this is now when pre-prepared, all these, the census data,

805
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:08,200
the data about filling out all this-

806
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:09,960
The smart meters watching everything you're doing.

807
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:13,560
They're collecting data right now to know where everything is. So when they come to

808
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:17,720
get the guns, they all say, well, give us the one you got in that closet. You registered

809
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:22,680
it. We know you've got it. Hand it over. You know, this is where the information-

810
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:26,120
And they know when people fight back, then it'll be, oh, there's a new terrorist threat.

811
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:30,360
All we want to do is register the guns. What's wrong with that? Well, as soon as you've registered-

812
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:31,360
Then they take them.

813
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:32,360
They know where they are.

814
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:35,240
They go, but you can keep your bolt action. Now Australia is banning bolt action.

815
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:39,200
Well, and again, what's an assault rifle? Well, the assault rifle is going to be anything

816
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:40,360
they decide is an assault rifle.

817
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:42,800
That's why they're now saying, oh, it's handguns too we're going to ban.

818
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:47,440
Anything you want is an assault rifle. And again, the Second Amendment was designed for

819
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:50,200
this very situation for people to stay there.

820
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:53,280
We got to talk about what the Second Amendment was designed for with Dr. Jerome Corsi coming

821
01:04:53,280 --> 01:05:01,040
up, and then we'll get into all the other huge issues taking place right now.

822
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:05,000
Millions of people are going to get sick this winter from colds, flu, and other illnesses.

823
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:09,760

Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does

854
01:08:12,540 --> 01:08:21,820
he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.

855
01:08:21,820 --> 01:08:29,660
Again, it's Friday, the 25th day of January, 2013. We've got Dr. Jerome Corsi here with

856
01:08:29,660 --> 01:08:34,540
us for another 25 minutes or so and then he's got to leave and get on an airplane. Again,

857
01:08:34,540 --> 01:08:39,820
he is a Ph.D. from Harvard University in political science. I work with the State Department

858
01:08:39,820 --> 01:08:43,980
and other agencies in highly classified areas as a consultant and of course has written

859
01:08:43,980 --> 01:08:50,140
five New York Times bestselling non-fiction books, many of them number one and he writes

860
01:08:50,140 --> 01:08:53,220
for World Net Daily and he's got a bunch of ebooks out right now.

861
01:08:53,220 --> 01:08:57,540
And yes, there are a lot of different sociologists and that's how communists operate during the

862
01:08:57,540 --> 01:09:02,820
infiltration phase because they want to bankrupt things, then blame free market and they get

863
01:09:02,820 --> 01:09:07,300
so many dependent they can take over. Now, Doc, we've had great banner, everybody's saying

864
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:14,580
powerful radio earlier, but I want to be able to now just sit back and have you recap everything

865
01:09:14,580 --> 01:09:20,100
you've said that this is the global mega banks, anti-free market with the socialists and the

866
01:09:20,100 --> 01:09:21,100
communists.

867
01:09:21,100 --> 01:09:26,180
To recap last hour, leveraging with the communist Chinese using limited capitalism where they

868
01:09:26,180 --> 01:09:31,300
exempt themselves from the rules, basically modern slavery to take over and how we beat

869
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:35,180
them and what we're facing and how they use the drugs, how the big banks are behind that.

870
01:09:35,180 --> 01:09:38,300
You wanted to talk about that. I'm going to just sit back now. You've got the floor.

871
01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:41,900
I mean, there's so many. First of all, I want to start out with the Second Amendment. I

872
01:09:41,900 --> 01:09:45,700
want to say this about the Second Amendment. Second Amendment was written for a time like

873
01:09:45,700 --> 01:09:51,260
this. It was written for a time, you know, Revolutionary War was when the British were

874
01:09:51,260 --> 01:09:55,580
taking everything over, British making a final play to dominate the colonies.

875
01:09:55,580 --> 01:10:01,340
And the militias then at that point, people being armed were critical. An armed public

876
01:10:01,340 --> 01:10:06,900
today, Second Amendment is a powerful tool. It's why it's being attacked. It's critical

877
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:12,300
to maintain. Now, the next thing I want to say is, look, and Alex, we are the drug cartels,

878
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:18,140
the government of the United States. You got the NSA, which is reading everybody's emails.

879
01:10:18,140 --> 01:10:24,380
Now, you mean to say, and I showed and published with John Cruz, the whistleblower, the information

880
01:10:24,380 --> 01:10:30,780
about HSBC money laundering, money coming from the drug cartels. That has to happen

881
01:10:30,780 --> 01:10:37,940
with the US government knowing about it. You mean Treasury, Federal Reserve, NSA, CIA didn't

882
01:10:37,940 --> 01:10:44,580
know that Mexican drug launderers were driving into Tijuana with a truckload of $100 bills

883
01:10:44,580 --> 01:10:49,620
sitting in the high net worth area, drinking espresso while that's being processed into

884
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:55,160
the bank and shoveled all over the world on behalf of the drug cartels.

885
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:59,220
We facilitated that. I've talked to the Air Force and Army officers who sit there with

886
01:10:59,220 --> 01:11:03,700
the surveillance blimps and the aircraft, and they're told let that through, let that,

887
01:11:03,700 --> 01:11:08,180
stop that. Why do we have more heroin coming out of Afghanistan

888
01:11:08,180 --> 01:11:15,940
today than when the Taliban ran Afghanistan? Again, we are the drug cartels. We are the

889
01:11:15,940 --> 01:11:21,260
gun runners of the world. Fast and Furious was just the tip of the iceberg. You mean

890
01:11:21,260 --> 01:11:26,580
guns are being run worldwide and the NSA and the CIA doesn't know what's happening and

891
01:11:26,580 --> 01:11:32,460
can't catch anybody. It's nonsense. Drug cartels penetrating into the United States. You mean

892
01:11:32,460 --> 01:11:36,660
we're able to sell billions of dollars, I'd say the drug business may be a trillion dollar

893
01:11:36,660 --> 01:11:37,660
business-

894
01:11:37,660 --> 01:11:38,660
It is.

895
01:11:38,660 --> 01:11:44,500
To drug addicts in the streets of Colorado and every other city of America, and the CIA

896
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:46,500
and the FBI can't find them?

897
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:52,100
Well, I mean, Wells Fargo with Warren Buffett got caught laundering $378 million two years

898
01:11:52,100 --> 01:11:53,780
ago with Wachovia.

899
01:11:53,780 --> 01:11:58,020
The major profits I think today being made in the banking system worldwide come from

900
01:11:58,020 --> 01:12:03,540
money laundering. The money laundering laws that are out there are not to catch the drug

901
01:12:03,540 --> 01:12:04,540
cartel.

902
01:12:04,540 --> 01:12:05,540
They're to harass us.

903
01:12:05,540 --> 01:12:09,360
They basically permit the federal government to track everything you're doing in the bank

904
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:15,660
where your money is. Make sure you're not using any cash. The catch who's being caught

905
01:12:15,660 --> 01:12:20,020
with the Patriot Act are legitimate citizens who just do one or two things wrong.

906
01:12:20,020 --> 01:12:25,380
No, no, no, I know someone in Texas who has a successful business, no criminal record,

907
01:12:25,380 --> 01:12:30,580
and over two decades had saved up a couple $100,000 in cash, went to put it back in the

908
01:12:30,580 --> 01:12:31,580
bank-

909
01:12:31,580 --> 01:12:32,580
They'll be harassed.

910
01:12:32,580 --> 01:12:33,580
Or was arrested.

911
01:12:33,580 --> 01:12:38,220
Yeah, right, exactly. And see, but yet you come into Tijuana with a truckload $100 bills,

912
01:12:38,220 --> 01:12:43,140
hey, you're a preferred customer. And that money is gonna pass right through the entire

913
01:12:43,140 --> 01:12:48,740
system, gonna come through banks. HSBC was money laundering in Long Island.

914
01:12:48,740 --> 01:12:54,300
We had the data stealing people's social security numbers, creating false accounts, running

915
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:59,860
millions of dollars through these false accounts, closing the accounts. So there was no trace

916
01:12:59,860 --> 01:13:05,020
of them. We turned the information, John Cruz, the whistleblower, I wrote about it in WND.

917
01:13:05,020 --> 01:13:10,220
We went into the Department of Homeland Security in New York, turned over this information,

918
01:13:10,220 --> 01:13:12,460
turned it over to the Congress.

919
01:13:12,460 --> 01:13:17,420
And nobody was doing anything until we started publicizing it, writing the articles about

920
01:13:17,420 --> 01:13:26,100
it, exposing it. I've exposed HSBC in India, all around the world, HSBC is a criminal bank.

921
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:31,260
It's engaging in these activities. And if HSBC wants to sue me, hey, I'll save them

922
01:13:31,260 --> 01:13:32,260
the problem.

923
01:13:32,260 --> 01:13:35,200
But I mean, wait a minute, it's in the news. It's in the news that all the big Federal

924
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:37,700
Reserve member banks and others have been caught.

925
01:13:37,700 --> 01:13:42,020
Laundering money. They are laundering, it's the only way the drug business-

926
01:13:42,020 --> 01:13:44,540
That's why they keep it illegal to keep the price up.

927
01:13:44,540 --> 01:13:48,420
You can't have a drug business if the governments don't cooperate.

928
01:13:48,420 --> 01:13:49,420
Now doctor-

929
01:13:49,420 --> 01:13:55,780
It's the same with the guns. The guns are the same. The federal government wants a monopoly

930
01:13:55,780 --> 01:13:59,880
on the weapons so that they can put the weapons where they want them.

931
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:01,320
And selectively arrest us.

932
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:04,860
And selectively arrest us if we dare have any. But they'll be happy to get them in the

933
01:14:04,860 --> 01:14:08,540
hands of Al-Qaeda. Where does Al-Qaeda get the weapons?

934
01:14:08,540 --> 01:14:09,540
Missiles.

935
01:14:09,540 --> 01:14:12,440
Let's track the weapons that were used in Mali. Let's track the weapons that are used

936
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:15,660
in Syria. And find out they track right back to the state department.

937
01:14:15,660 --> 01:14:19,100
Now let me bring this up since you said that. People always in the mainstream media spin

938
01:14:19,100 --> 01:14:23,620
it. That I'm saying, and this is a quote of Chris Matthews, that Bush was at the towers

939
01:14:23,620 --> 01:14:24,620
with a plunger.

940
01:14:24,620 --> 01:14:28,380
Bush is a teleprompter reading puppet like Obama to many levels. Though Obama and more

941
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:31,820
and more we're learning is actually enjoying what's happening and in there running some

942
01:14:31,820 --> 01:14:32,820
of the things.

943
01:14:32,820 --> 01:14:38,820
I've always said criminal globalist elements are financing and using Al-Qaeda as a pretext

944
01:14:38,820 --> 01:14:43,460
to menace us into slavery. And as a pretext to bring in a police state and look at the

945
01:14:43,460 --> 01:14:47,420
homeland documents. It's all about returning veterans gun owners. I mean, don't I get an

946
01:14:47,420 --> 01:14:51,220
apology from the national conservatives out there who spun it?

947
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:53,700
That I was saying the whole government was doing 9-11?

948
01:14:53,700 --> 01:14:59,100
I would say forget about it. The issue is that you're right in tracking the information

949
01:14:59,100 --> 01:15:02,340
and getting it out. This is, apologies whether you'll ever get-

950
01:15:02,340 --> 01:15:06,120
Sure, sure, I don't even want that. My point is, is I'm saying there's a criminal globalist

951
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:08,260
element in the government using Al-Qaeda.

952
01:15:08,260 --> 01:15:13,820
We have a criminal government. Our government is running drugs, permitting it to happen

953
01:15:13,820 --> 01:15:15,540
and running guns.

954
01:15:15,540 --> 01:15:16,540
And running Al-Qaeda.

955
01:15:16,540 --> 01:15:21,740
And running Al-Qaeda. We are the drug cartels. We are Al-Qaeda. This is a fundamental-

956
01:15:21,740 --> 01:15:26,020
You know 100 miles into the Texas border, all over the state, anywhere I have to go,

957
01:15:26,020 --> 01:15:28,500
they have border patrol checkpoints. And when I pull up now and they go, I want to search

958
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:31,860
your car, I go, you know the government ships the drugs. And they go, all right, you can

959
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:33,760
go. I mean, they all know it.

960
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:39,540
And look, Al-Qaeda right now, we have a group of expatriates out of Libya. They've been

961
01:15:39,540 --> 01:15:43,900
sending us information. Al-Qaeda has taken over Libya.

962
01:15:43,900 --> 01:15:45,580
They fly the flags there.

963
01:15:45,580 --> 01:15:51,100
And they are, in fact, raging a tribal war where they're killing other tribes that were

964
01:15:51,100 --> 01:15:56,460
favorable to Qaddafi. We're not saying, we've got to use this doctrine to protect people

965
01:15:56,460 --> 01:15:57,460
as the UN go in.

966
01:15:57,460 --> 01:15:59,180
Well, they're ethically closing the blacks.

967
01:15:59,180 --> 01:16:04,660
Because as long as Al-Qaeda is killing people, our government's gonna stand down. I mean,

968
01:16:04,660 --> 01:16:10,420
the whole Arab Spring was a takeover by the Muslim Brotherhood of all these countries,

969
01:16:10,420 --> 01:16:11,420
one after the other.

970
01:16:11,420 --> 01:16:12,820
So where's it all going? How do we beat this?

971
01:16:12,820 --> 01:16:18,040
Well, again, exposing it is fundamental. People waking up and understanding that we've got

972
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:22,540
a criminal government. It demands investigation. When you were calling for investigations,

973
01:16:22,540 --> 01:16:26,620
Alex, you need to have you on the investigating committee.

974
01:16:26,620 --> 01:16:33,460
Get some Warren Commission that you get the State Department and the Justice Department

975
01:16:33,460 --> 01:16:38,380
saying for the first 24 hours, we gotta make sure Lee Harvey Oswald's found as the culprit.

976
01:16:38,380 --> 01:16:44,300
Paper over it. Put the critics on the investigating committees, give them the power, and let's

977
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:46,540
prosecute the federal officials.

978
01:16:46,540 --> 01:16:51,820
How about Nancy Pelosi? How about Barack Obama? In terms of criminal activity-

979
01:16:51,820 --> 01:16:56,660
Rand Paul said bare minimum, Hillary should have to step down. Obviously, the White House

980
01:16:56,660 --> 01:16:57,660
has been caught lying.

981
01:16:57,660 --> 01:17:02,940
Quit lying. I wanna know, for the eight hours this embassy was under attack and we had drones

982
01:17:02,940 --> 01:17:05,460
there, do they sit and watch it in the State Department House?

983
01:17:05,460 --> 01:17:06,460
Of course they did.

984
01:17:06,460 --> 01:17:12,780
Do they go to bed and let our people die in the field over there? While in fact, we had

985
01:17:12,780 --> 01:17:17,300
Al-Qaeda attacking and we were running drugs. We'd rather have those ambassadors die than

986
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:22,380
admit they were there with guns that were run, that was a cache of guns that were illegally

987
01:17:22,380 --> 01:17:26,980
brought into the United States by the United States headed to Syria.

988
01:17:26,980 --> 01:17:32,980
If they didn't die, we were gonna expose our own gun running. So the White House and over

989
01:17:32,980 --> 01:17:38,340
in Pentagon and CIA, they watched them die rather than call in military-

990
01:17:38,340 --> 01:17:41,580
And ordered the CIA torture base down the road to not help.

991
01:17:41,580 --> 01:17:47,900
And stand down. Some of the, I believe at least two of them, the government official,

992
01:17:47,900 --> 01:17:53,180
the military that were there dying in Benghazi, basically violated orders and went in.

993
01:17:53,180 --> 01:17:54,660
That's right, yeah, the Navy SEALs-

994
01:17:54,660 --> 01:17:59,580
Navy SEALs violated orders, they weren't gonna stand for this. They were there begging for

995
01:17:59,580 --> 01:18:06,420
help. They were calling in trajectories, giving target locations. Well, that was because the

996
01:18:06,420 --> 01:18:08,140
drones around there had to be armed.

997
01:18:08,140 --> 01:18:13,300
For eight hours, you had up to 500 people with anti-aircraft guns cranked down to the

998
01:18:13,300 --> 01:18:15,380
ground, firing into the building.

999
01:18:15,380 --> 01:18:21,260
What does Obama and Hillary come? They say, it's because of a movie. Again, using the

1000
01:18:21,260 --> 01:18:27,260
incident to try to quash free speech. They were insulted over this movie.

1001
01:18:27,260 --> 01:18:29,660
Well, they recycle everything they do to attack freedom.

1002
01:18:29,660 --> 01:18:34,580
Attack freedom, it's all back on attack the United States citizens. Take the guns away,

1003
01:18:34,580 --> 01:18:38,660
take the First Amendment away, and use any incident that happens.

1004
01:18:38,660 --> 01:18:42,540
Let me ask you this, if we don't stop them studying this worldwide, reading their own

1005
01:18:42,540 --> 01:18:47,500
white papers, their own sociologists, where does it go if we don't stop them?

1006
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:52,860
If it doesn't stop them, we might as well read Nazi Germany again, cuz we're gonna be

1007
01:18:52,860 --> 01:18:55,860
the victims in another Nazi Germany. There's gonna be no place to go.

1008
01:18:55,860 --> 01:18:56,860
These are authoritarians.

1009
01:18:56,860 --> 01:19:01,420
Yeah, and let's let Congress know that if Congress doesn't listen, everybody in Congress,

1010
01:19:01,420 --> 01:19:03,900
we vote out. Anybody who's there, we just vote out.

1011
01:19:03,900 --> 01:19:07,220
It's time to be freaking out. I mean, this is openly-

1012
01:19:07,220 --> 01:19:13,300
And demand hearings, demand investigations, press the information. Every day, Alex, when

1013
01:19:13,300 --> 01:19:18,100
you're out there, showing people what's really in the news, your audience, what we're doing

1014
01:19:18,100 --> 01:19:22,600
at WND, this is an extremely important function.

1015
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:27,740
Get the truth, the trans-Texas corridor, when people realize that they were gonna take four

1016
01:19:27,740 --> 01:19:33,060
football fields wide to Texas, and give it to Spain to develop as high-

1017
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:34,620
That's globalism.

1018
01:19:34,620 --> 01:19:40,060
And finally, Texans came out of these meetings, they told Rick Perry and the Texas Department

1019
01:19:40,060 --> 01:19:42,540
of Transportation, they could shove this plant.

1020
01:19:42,540 --> 01:19:44,860
But six years later, like a roach, he creeps back.

1021
01:19:44,860 --> 01:19:48,940
Come back, it's constant vigilance. Jefferson was right, constant-

1022
01:19:48,940 --> 01:19:51,540
And anyone who approaches the jewel is an enemy.

1023
01:19:51,540 --> 01:19:54,020
And they will target us as the enemy.

1024
01:19:54,020 --> 01:19:57,220
That's fine, we're committed, we're going all the way. We'll be back with a final segment

1025
01:19:57,220 --> 01:20:01,020
to talk about the new royalty. Stay with us.

1026
01:20:01,020 --> 01:20:05,860
Coming back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive? From natural disasters

1027
01:20:05,860 --> 01:20:10,460
like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought, to the family hardships brought on

1028
01:20:10,460 --> 01:20:15,020
by a disastrous economy. Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything.

1029
01:20:15,020 --> 01:20:18,820
At e Foods Direct, we hear from customers every day that are fortunate enough to weather

1030
01:20:18,820 --> 01:20:21,740
life's storm by having a supply of food on hand.

1031
01:20:21,740 --> 01:20:26,300
After Hurricane Sandy, Danny from New York City wrote, almost all of the grocery stores

1032
01:20:26,300 --> 01:20:31,100
are closed, but I managed to get my e Foods just in time to be able to help my sister

1033
01:20:31,100 --> 01:20:32,100
and niece.

1034
01:20:32,100 --> 01:20:35,900
It is better to be prepared ten years too early than one day too late.

1035
01:20:35,900 --> 01:20:38,020
I can warn you, but I can't feed you.

1036
01:20:38,020 --> 01:20:40,340

1041
01:21:01,900 --> 01:21:04,180
Hey there, Frank Bates here.

1042
01:21:04,180 --> 01:21:09,260
Have you heard about the weird device that could wipe out 280 million Americans?

1043
01:21:09,260 --> 01:21:11,020
This is really scary stuff.

1044
01:21:11,020 --> 01:21:16,260
Defense experts warn that this odd device poses the greatest threat we've ever known.

1045
01:21:16,260 --> 01:21:20,580
In fact, just a few weeks ago, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich wrote an op-ed

1046
01:21:20,580 --> 01:21:24,220
piece for the Washington Post warning about this deadly threat.

1047
01:21:24,220 --> 01:21:27,100
I can't believe that more people aren't talking about this.

1048
01:21:27,100 --> 01:21:30,980
It may be because the liberals and the government are trying to cover it up.

1049
01:21:30,980 --> 01:21:36,660
That's why my friend just created a free video at weirddevice.com that exposes this threat

1050
01:21:36,660 --> 01:21:39,460
and blows the doors off the conspiracy.

We the people grow cotton, wheat fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from

1065
01:22:33,460 --> 01:22:37,680
counterfeit and carting to a private bank, having it lead back at interest, forcing taxes

1066
01:22:37,680 --> 01:22:38,680
to service debt.

1067
01:22:38,680 --> 01:22:42,200
This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public

1068
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:45,580
currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?

1069
01:22:45,580 --> 01:22:46,580

1075
01:22:57,820 --> 01:23:03,180
Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the bestselling book, Cancer Step Outside the

1076
01:23:03,180 --> 01:23:04,180
Box.

1077
01:23:04,180 --> 01:23:07,140
I want you to know some very important information.

1078
01:23:07,140 --> 01:23:11,940
In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White

1079
01:23:11,940 --> 01:23:16,260
House at a time when only the president could obtain this world-class healer.

1080
01:23:16,260 --> 01:23:21,840
Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.

1081
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:26,900
Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of super bugs with 17 naturally

1082
01:23:26,900 --> 01:23:32,060
occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single

1083
01:23:32,060 --> 01:23:33,180
normal cell.

1084
01:23:33,180 --> 01:23:36,860
If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune

1085
01:23:36,860 --> 01:23:40,940

1088
01:23:56,220 --> 01:23:57,220
Protect your immune system.

1089
01:23:57,220 --> 01:23:58,220
It's the only one you've got.

1090
01:23:58,220 --> 01:24:14,580
Final segment with Dr. Jerome Corsi, he's got a big book coming out in a couple of months

1091
01:24:14,580 --> 01:24:19,940
exposing just the death panels that didn't exist and that they now are saying are so

1092
01:24:19,940 --> 01:24:20,940
great.

1093
01:24:20,940 --> 01:24:26,260
It is just unspeakable how evil these authoritarians are and it's not authoritarianism for domination

1094
01:24:26,260 --> 01:24:28,740
because they have some grand plan to help people.

1095
01:24:28,740 --> 01:24:31,580
The globalists, I've studied them, really hate humanity.

1096
01:24:31,580 --> 01:24:35,260
They're very unhappy, nasty people, but you mentioned something earlier I wanted to flesh

1097
01:24:35,260 --> 01:24:36,260
out here.

1098
01:24:36,260 --> 01:24:43,140
Here's the weekly standard and it is in the new bill, Feinstein Gun Control Bill to Exempt

1099
01:24:43,140 --> 01:24:44,140
Government Officials.

1100
01:24:44,140 --> 01:24:50,740
And I have the Huffington Post here with one of the police patrolman associations in New

1101
01:24:50,740 --> 01:24:54,600
York saying, well, we need guns to protect ourselves from criminals.

1102
01:24:54,600 --> 01:25:00,580
So the police now under this federal bill are saying, well, we're gonna take all of

1103
01:25:00,580 --> 01:25:04,100
your guns, but we'll still be able to have guns to protect ourselves cuz criminals won't

1104
01:25:04,100 --> 01:25:05,500
follow laws.

1105
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:07,140
This is new titles of nobility.

1106
01:25:07,140 --> 01:25:12,760
This is what our founders fought because the police and all former feds, just like you

1107
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:15,700
said earlier, Congress exempts itself from Obamacare.

1108
01:25:15,700 --> 01:25:16,700
Exactly.

1109
01:25:16,700 --> 01:25:19,220
I mean, that is so discriminatory.

1110
01:25:19,220 --> 01:25:22,680
Obama gets to have all the vacations he wants, travel anywhere he wants to go.

1111
01:25:22,680 --> 01:25:25,060
Look at how Nancy Pelosi flies around.

1112
01:25:25,060 --> 01:25:28,320
This is all, they have their own health system in Congress.

1113
01:25:28,320 --> 01:25:33,000
They have their own lifestyle, their own parking lot, their own restaurants.

1114
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:37,380
It's a scenic cure for life, pensions forever if you're in for one term.

1115
01:25:37,380 --> 01:25:42,840
You know, look, Alex, this entire plan, the entire attack on God, that's what my new book

1116
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:44,660
is on, the ACLU.

1117
01:25:44,660 --> 01:25:48,220
It's on the plan to remove God, it's called the Bad Samaritan.

1118
01:25:48,220 --> 01:25:51,700
Gloria Steinem wears shirts saying, I got an abortion, it's beautiful.

1119
01:25:51,700 --> 01:25:53,340
We're celebrating abortions.

1120
01:25:53,340 --> 01:25:58,200
Now the next thing, if we're celebrating abortions, the next plan will be to celebrate the killing

1121
01:25:58,200 --> 01:25:59,200
of the old.

1122
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:00,980
You must not watch a mainline new TV.

1123
01:26:00,980 --> 01:26:06,020
No, no, no, the sexy thing is to talk about how ugly old people are and how great it is

1124
01:26:06,020 --> 01:26:07,020
to kill them.

1125
01:26:07,020 --> 01:26:08,020
Right, because they're useless.

1126
01:26:08,020 --> 01:26:11,660
They're just wasted, they're old, they can't do anything, they can't contribute, kill them.

1127
01:26:11,660 --> 01:26:17,580
But at the same time, all the groups that are supporting Obama, all the leftist-oriented

1128
01:26:17,580 --> 01:26:21,160
groups, the minorities, are being used as dupes.

1129
01:26:21,160 --> 01:26:22,520
Nothing is in return to them.

1130
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:23,520
Go into the-

1131
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:24,520
Obama won't even go talk to them.

1132
01:26:24,520 --> 01:26:25,820
Remember what Maxine Waters said.

1133
01:26:25,820 --> 01:26:28,740
Go to the African-American communities, look at the highest unemployment.

1134
01:26:28,740 --> 01:26:32,980
Look at the biggest crime and drug use, dropouts from schools-

1135
01:26:32,980 --> 01:26:33,980
Exploding.

1136
01:26:33,980 --> 01:26:34,980
Families.

1137
01:26:34,980 --> 01:26:37,420
What is any federal government doing to, you know, the-

1138
01:26:37,420 --> 01:26:40,380
Chicago, where the dawn runs, thanks.

1139
01:26:40,380 --> 01:26:42,020
Go into Detroit.

1140
01:26:42,020 --> 01:26:46,280
Take a look at the comparison, it's circulating in the Internet, between Detroit and Hiroshima

1141
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:47,820
at the end of World War II.

1142
01:26:47,820 --> 01:26:52,660
Hiroshima is a thriving community, Detroit, under socialism, is devastated.

1143
01:26:52,660 --> 01:26:55,820
That's the future of America under socialism, Detroit.

1144
01:26:55,820 --> 01:26:56,820
Go look at it.

1145
01:26:56,820 --> 01:27:02,860
No jobs, the jobs to China, everybody in poverty, everybody facing either go into the drug-

1146
01:27:02,860 --> 01:27:06,980
And when I say to socialists that are mid-level and really mean well, they go, everything's

1147
01:27:06,980 --> 01:27:10,980
gonna collapse, austerity, you wanna kill old people, and meanwhile it's the eugenicists

1148
01:27:10,980 --> 01:27:12,980
saying they're gonna kill the old people.

1149
01:27:12,980 --> 01:27:17,020
And my book, this whole thing, gotta look at the Cloward Piven theory.

1150
01:27:17,020 --> 01:27:25,260
The plan is to so bankrupt the United States with new entitlement programs, Obamacare,

1151
01:27:25,260 --> 01:27:29,740
you've got, you know, all the food stamps you want, well, they'll roll out entitlement

1152
01:27:29,740 --> 01:27:35,020
after entitlement, because the idea is we'll never be able to pay for them, we'll be bankrupt,

1153
01:27:35,020 --> 01:27:38,980
and the collapse of the United States, they'll blame capitalism, then they'll open the door

1154
01:27:38,980 --> 01:27:42,300
for the Chinese, the Chinese will own the debt, and the socialists-

1155
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:43,300
They already do.

1156
01:27:43,300 --> 01:27:46,580
The Chinese know how to run capitalism, we'll just use the Chinese system.

1157
01:27:46,580 --> 01:27:49,140
Constitution's an old document, we've already had the Georgia-

1158
01:27:49,140 --> 01:27:54,940
They're already saying that in the Piers Pressure article, do one on this.

1159
01:27:54,940 --> 01:28:00,220
This article says we need to do what the communist Chinese say, read it, and then I'll be dealt

1160
01:28:00,220 --> 01:28:01,220
with.

1161
01:28:01,220 --> 01:28:04,940
And that's gonna be for everybody right here.

1162
01:28:04,940 --> 01:28:07,660
Actually, did you see Piers Morgan say he wants to shoot me?

1163
01:28:07,660 --> 01:28:10,500
Yes, I saw that, I saw the entire series-

1164
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:13,180
Have you been around the so-called liberals privately where all they were talking about

1165
01:28:13,180 --> 01:28:14,180
is killing people?

1166
01:28:14,180 --> 01:28:19,940
Look, the whole agenda is a death agenda, it's killing babies, how are we gonna celebrate

1167
01:28:19,940 --> 01:28:20,940
killing babies?

1168
01:28:20,940 --> 01:28:21,940
Killing old people.

1169
01:28:21,940 --> 01:28:22,940
Killing old people.

1170
01:28:22,940 --> 01:28:26,060
How could the free market pay for everybody, and now socialism, nothing can be paid for?

1171
01:28:26,060 --> 01:28:31,460
In fact, look, people don't understand, this is not an economic downturn we're in.

1172
01:28:31,460 --> 01:28:37,380
This is a created, manipulated, structural unemployment, where even if the economy improves,

1173
01:28:37,380 --> 01:28:38,900
the jobs created are in China.

1174
01:28:38,900 --> 01:28:41,460
They've doubled the food stamps, that's on goal.

1175
01:28:41,460 --> 01:28:44,660
They've had increasing dependency on the federal government.

1176
01:28:44,660 --> 01:28:48,140
And they're saying, and they've even got Rand Paul going, we've gotta adapt or die, that's

1177
01:28:48,140 --> 01:28:52,420
psy-op to make the Republican Party just the right wing of the left.

1178
01:28:52,420 --> 01:28:55,060
The Republican Party and the Democratic Party are essentially one party.

1179
01:28:55,060 --> 01:28:56,060
It's a psy-op.

1180
01:28:56,060 --> 01:28:57,060
It's one party.

1181
01:28:57,060 --> 01:28:58,580
People are rejecting socialism.

1182
01:28:58,580 --> 01:29:01,460
And people have gotta continue to reject socialism.

1183
01:29:01,460 --> 01:29:04,820
People have gotta start taking strong measures, demanding-

1184
01:29:04,820 --> 01:29:05,860
And it's time to start-

1185
01:29:05,860 --> 01:29:06,860
Federal investigations.

1186
01:29:06,860 --> 01:29:09,940
I agree, but isn't it start to not complying as well?

1187
01:29:09,940 --> 01:29:13,660
It's also, first of all, the Second Amendment is fundamental.

1188
01:29:13,660 --> 01:29:15,940
People have got to retain their guns.

1189
01:29:15,940 --> 01:29:19,940
The Second Amendment was created for times when tyranny is on the run.

1190
01:29:19,940 --> 01:29:20,940
And it's here.

1191
01:29:20,940 --> 01:29:21,940
It's here.

1192
01:29:21,940 --> 01:29:22,940
And it's here, and it's on the move.

1193
01:29:22,940 --> 01:29:25,600
You know, our founders are fighting for us from the grave.

1194
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:30,140
And we've gotta listen, because the words that they gave us, the instructions and the

1195
01:29:30,140 --> 01:29:32,220
tools are right there.

1196
01:29:32,220 --> 01:29:36,260
First Amendment, Second Amendment, and we've gotta demand the federal government as a criminal

1197
01:29:36,260 --> 01:29:38,460
government running drug cartels-

1198
01:29:38,460 --> 01:29:41,580
Tell you what, come back and do five more minutes with us in the big announcement.

1199
01:29:41,580 --> 01:29:44,660
I want you to finish up plans to turn this around.

1200
01:29:44,660 --> 01:29:50,060
Okay, fantastic, here we go.

1201
01:29:50,060 --> 01:29:51,340
We're on the march.

1202
01:29:51,340 --> 01:29:53,740
The empire's on the run.

1203
01:29:53,740 --> 01:30:02,380
Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

1204
01:30:02,380 --> 01:30:07,060
Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our

1205
01:30:07,060 --> 01:30:09,100
immunity and health.

1206
01:30:09,100 --> 01:30:13,700

01:30:30,980 --> 01:30:35,620
Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and

1212
01:30:35,620 --> 01:30:40,780
leave the silver at the surface, but rather we have formulated our silver gel using the

1213
01:30:40,780 --> 01:30:45,340
natural skin-nourishing chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the

1214
01:30:45,340 --> 01:30:49,340
skin while delivering the silver more effectively.

1215

That's www.silverlungs.com.

1218
01:31:01,460 --> 01:31:06,440
Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive from natural disasters

1219
01:31:06,440 --> 01:31:11,020
like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on

1220
01:31:11,020 --> 01:31:12,900
by a disastrous economy?

1221
01:31:12,900 --> 01:31:15,600
Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything.

1222
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:19,780
At eFoods Direct, we hear from customers every day that are fortunate enough to weather life's

1223
01:31:19,780 --> 01:31:22,060
storm by having a supply of food on hand.

1224
01:31:22,060 --> 01:31:26,860
After Hurricane Sandy, Danny from New York City wrote, almost all the grocery stores

1225
01:31:26,860 --> 01:31:31,660
are closed, but I managed to get my eFoods just in time to be able to help my sister

1226
01:31:31,660 --> 01:31:32,660
and niece.

1227
01:31:32,660 --> 01:31:36,460
It is better to be prepared 10 years too early than one day too late.

1228
01:31:36,460 --> 01:31:38,700
I can warn you, but I can't feed you.

1229
01:31:38,700 --> 01:31:41,060

1234
01:32:01,460 --> 01:32:04,260
Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.

1235
01:32:04,260 --> 01:32:09,500
The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.

1236
01:32:09,500 --> 01:32:15,540
The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce

1237
01:32:15,540 --> 01:32:16,540
to the global takeover.

1238
01:32:16,540 --> 01:32:22,420
That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at infowarshop.com.

1239
01:32:22,420 --> 01:32:26,140
These are items that I did research on that I personally use.

1240
01:32:26,140 --> 01:32:31,140
You've got the LifeStraw so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.

1241
01:32:31,140 --> 01:32:35,900
The Ktor Handcrank Generator to charge up key equipment during power outages or out

1242
01:32:35,900 --> 01:32:36,900
in the field.

1243
01:32:36,900 --> 01:32:39,940
Strategic Relocation, third edition by Joel Skousen.

1244
01:32:39,940 --> 01:32:42,380
When Disaster Strikes by Matthew Stein.

1245
01:32:42,380 --> 01:32:47,140
TheraSafe used by Homeland Security to protect yourself during any radiological event.

1246
01:32:47,140 --> 01:32:50,160
Handcrank shortwave AM-FM radios.

1247
01:32:50,160 --> 01:32:54,500
Everything that we've researched and found to be the best is available at infowarshop.com

1248
01:32:54,500 --> 01:32:57,300
and your purchase makes our info war possible.

1249
01:32:57,300 --> 01:32:58,460
We're getting prepared.

1250
01:32:58,460 --> 01:32:59,460
Are you?

1251
01:32:59,460 --> 01:33:00,460
Infowarsshop.com.

1252
01:33:00,460 --> 01:33:09,700
Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide.

1253
01:33:09,700 --> 01:33:11,740
It's Alex Jones.

1254
01:33:11,740 --> 01:33:18,340
Here's a surprise, tyrants.

1255
01:33:18,340 --> 01:33:19,340
We can see you.

1256
01:33:19,340 --> 01:33:25,860
We can see for miles and miles and miles and we know your playbook.

1257
01:33:25,860 --> 01:33:30,460
We've been warning people for decades and now that we're coming down to the wire, people

1258
01:33:30,460 --> 01:33:37,780
are going, wait, Ron Paul, Dr. Corsi, Alex Jones, G. Edward Griffin, countless others,

1259
01:33:37,780 --> 01:33:41,220
Bob Chapman, the list goes on and on, Lou Rockwell.

1260
01:33:41,220 --> 01:33:45,820
They all warned us about this and exactly what they said is now happening.

1261
01:33:45,820 --> 01:33:49,060
They told us 10 years ago the smart meters were going to hook into all our electronics

1262
01:33:49,060 --> 01:33:52,780
and track us in taxes and surveillance and the government said it was a conspiracy theory

1263
01:33:52,780 --> 01:33:53,780
but now it's admitted.

1264
01:33:53,780 --> 01:33:57,900
Well, wait, Alex said the NSA was spying on us 10 years ago without warrants, non-terror

1265
01:33:57,900 --> 01:33:58,900
related.

1266
01:33:58,900 --> 01:33:59,900
Now they admit it.

1267
01:33:59,900 --> 01:34:02,380
Alex said that it was really for the American people, Homeland Security.

1268
01:34:02,380 --> 01:34:03,380
Now it's admitted.

1269
01:34:03,380 --> 01:34:06,140
Again, it's all happening.

1270
01:34:06,140 --> 01:34:09,900
We've got a chance to beat these people if you realize they're really bad people.

1271
01:34:09,900 --> 01:34:14,100
They're not misguided liberals, environmental wackos.

1272
01:34:14,100 --> 01:34:17,500
I wish Rush Limbaugh would stop saying they're idiot wackos.

1273
01:34:17,500 --> 01:34:20,940
These are, cuz I've been in hundreds of their events and they always come over when the

1274
01:34:20,940 --> 01:34:24,580
cameras off and punch you in the arm or grab your shirt and say I'm gonna get you.

1275
01:34:24,580 --> 01:34:25,660
One day we're gonna get you.

1276
01:34:25,660 --> 01:34:27,340
I'm sure that's happened to you, Dr. Corsi.

1277
01:34:27,340 --> 01:34:30,580
In closing, we've got some huge news coming up after you go.

1278
01:34:30,580 --> 01:34:34,100
Kissinger predicts nuclear war with Iran, infowars.com.

1279
01:34:34,100 --> 01:34:38,040
Holder begins gun control push trying to raise money for the Democratic Party on the back

1280
01:34:38,040 --> 01:34:43,020
of it, fireside chats, assault weapon ban lacks Democratic votes to pass Senate.

1281
01:34:43,020 --> 01:34:45,380
Don't think they won't have another shooting, ladies and gentlemen.

1282
01:34:45,380 --> 01:34:47,620
Now that is just some of the stuff we've got here.

1283
01:34:47,620 --> 01:34:52,380
We're gonna make the big announcement on the $115,000 biggest contest ever after he leaves

1284
01:34:52,380 --> 01:34:54,100
his operation, Paul Revere.

1285
01:34:54,100 --> 01:35:00,000
That's going live with a red link right now at infowars.com and we'll post it to prisonplanet.com

1286
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,260
as a backup.

1287
01:35:01,260 --> 01:35:03,940
But doctor, we've had great banner for the last hour.

1288
01:35:03,940 --> 01:35:08,100
Other points you wanna add about solutions, I just wanna first get your take on this.

1289
01:35:08,100 --> 01:35:13,740
Look, if this is real, I mean, you're more steeled than ever knowing it's real.

1290
01:35:13,740 --> 01:35:15,020
We've talked privately.

1291
01:35:15,020 --> 01:35:18,900
It's now all manifesting, our worst analysis being proven right.

1292
01:35:18,900 --> 01:35:21,620
Again, people better take this serious.

1293
01:35:21,620 --> 01:35:23,700
What can you say to police and military?

1294
01:35:23,700 --> 01:35:28,100
I'm talking to police and military, and they're either totally waking up, and the majority

1295
01:35:28,100 --> 01:35:31,180
of them are, or they're deciding to just sign on to evil.

1296
01:35:31,180 --> 01:35:32,900
How will the system deal with that?

1297
01:35:32,900 --> 01:35:38,000
Well, the police and the military have got to the oath keepers, the whole plan to reach

1298
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:43,300
out and say, look, because the new world order will turn on the police as well.

1299
01:35:43,300 --> 01:35:44,300
They always do.

1300
01:35:44,300 --> 01:35:48,060
But if they don't sign on, they'll be equally victims in this.

1301
01:35:48,060 --> 01:35:50,860
But again, Alex, it's a plan.

1302
01:35:50,860 --> 01:35:52,900
The Obama plan to bankrupt America.

1303
01:35:52,900 --> 01:35:53,900
Your book.

1304
01:35:53,900 --> 01:35:58,300
That's what I've been pushing that people to read, you understand that once we are indebted

1305
01:35:58,300 --> 01:36:01,740
to China, we can't tell China to stay out.

1306
01:36:01,740 --> 01:36:07,820
Once you've sold current TV to Al Jazeera, Al Jazeera owns the airwaves.

1307
01:36:07,820 --> 01:36:10,340
That's globalism, have foreigners come in and buy everything.

1308
01:36:10,340 --> 01:36:12,740
And I wrote a book America for sale.

1309
01:36:12,740 --> 01:36:17,780
I warn people, you're gonna be reduced down to living in the safe places where you can

1310
01:36:17,780 --> 01:36:22,860
find to live, burying your guns, having food to live, and even that's not safe.

1311
01:36:22,860 --> 01:36:23,860
How long are you gonna last?

1312
01:36:23,860 --> 01:36:25,580
No, they know we've got the food.

1313
01:36:25,580 --> 01:36:28,740
But people can understand what you've been saying is true.

1314
01:36:28,740 --> 01:36:31,660
Fast and Furious occurred from the top.

1315
01:36:31,660 --> 01:36:37,920
It was a administration concocted plan by Eric Holder to take the guns away, to attack

1316
01:36:37,920 --> 01:36:38,920
the Second Amendment.

1317
01:36:38,920 --> 01:36:45,660
They have these guns show up at events, killings and murders and say, look, the guns are being

1318
01:36:45,660 --> 01:36:46,660
sold.

1319
01:36:46,660 --> 01:36:47,660
That came out in the memos.

1320
01:36:47,660 --> 01:36:49,660
It was out and he tried to get the truth.

1321
01:36:49,660 --> 01:36:51,500
The memos won't be released.

1322
01:36:51,500 --> 01:36:57,580
The testimony, even Hillary's testimony, lying testimony, testimony where Hillary did not

1323
01:36:57,580 --> 01:37:00,420
say, where are the 25 people who survived Benghazi?

1324
01:37:00,420 --> 01:37:01,980
Why can't we talk to them?

1325
01:37:01,980 --> 01:37:06,340
What was the White House doing and the CIA for the eight hours of this attack?

1326
01:37:06,340 --> 01:37:10,500
Were they watching it occur and not sending in the military to save our troops?

1327
01:37:10,500 --> 01:37:16,060
Why do the two SEALs have to essentially disobey orders to go to protect Stevens?

1328
01:37:16,060 --> 01:37:18,820
Again, what were the guns we were running there?

1329
01:37:18,820 --> 01:37:25,860
You do not launder billions of dollars through HSBC for the Mexican drug cartels.

1330
01:37:25,860 --> 01:37:28,140
All admitted, fines now out there.

1331
01:37:28,140 --> 01:37:30,740
We've been publishing it in WND without the government knowing-

1332
01:37:30,740 --> 01:37:35,220
The cartel leaders said in trials, hey, we have a national security pass.

1333
01:37:35,220 --> 01:37:36,720
We were doing this with the government.

1334
01:37:36,720 --> 01:37:38,840
We are the drug cartels.

1335
01:37:38,840 --> 01:37:40,060
We are Al-Qaeda.

1336
01:37:40,060 --> 01:37:41,380
We're arming Al-Qaeda.

1337
01:37:41,380 --> 01:37:45,960
We're arming the drug cartels and you've got to have, let's have criminal investigations

1338
01:37:45,960 --> 01:37:46,960
of Hillary.

1339
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:48,180
Let's get the documents.

1340
01:37:48,180 --> 01:37:49,540
Let's demand the documents.

1341
01:37:49,540 --> 01:37:50,740
Why are they so bold?

1342
01:37:50,740 --> 01:37:55,220
How could they publicly use Al-Qaeda in Libya and Syria and then go on the news and say,

1343
01:37:55,220 --> 01:37:57,060
you got to give your rights up.

1344
01:37:57,060 --> 01:37:58,060
Al-Qaeda got weapons in Libya.

1345
01:37:58,060 --> 01:38:02,660
Well, the compliant press with Piers Morgan, with all these other people, Piers, bring

1346
01:38:02,660 --> 01:38:05,300
the foreigners in here and have them lecture to us on gun control.

1347
01:38:05,300 --> 01:38:07,380
They actually says that and they're going to get me.

1348
01:38:07,380 --> 01:38:08,380
Yeah, exactly.

1349
01:38:08,380 --> 01:38:12,580
And the whole idea is avoid investigation.

1350
01:38:12,580 --> 01:38:15,420
That's what the government wants to do, no memos.

1351
01:38:15,420 --> 01:38:18,340
Where are the memos and the investigation on Ben Gotti?

1352
01:38:18,340 --> 01:38:22,980
Take the head of the EPA when they caught her using a dummy email.

1353
01:38:22,980 --> 01:38:24,340
HSBC, let's have a hearing.

1354
01:38:24,340 --> 01:38:25,720
How did that happen?

1355
01:38:25,720 --> 01:38:28,020
And the Federal Reserve and didn't know about it.

1356
01:38:28,020 --> 01:38:29,500
Why won't the Congress do it?

1357
01:38:29,500 --> 01:38:30,500
Blackmail threatened?

1358
01:38:30,500 --> 01:38:32,140
Look, the Congress is part of the deal.

1359
01:38:32,140 --> 01:38:36,420
Congress is being offered the lifetime royalty, as you say.

1360
01:38:36,420 --> 01:38:37,420
They've got their positions.

1361
01:38:37,420 --> 01:38:40,380
The Democratic and Republican Party are basically in agreement.

1362
01:38:40,380 --> 01:38:42,700
And now they're offering the cops lifetime royalty.

1363
01:38:42,700 --> 01:38:43,700
Take the people's guns.

1364
01:38:43,700 --> 01:38:45,180
You can keep yours after you retire.

1365
01:38:45,180 --> 01:38:48,120
Cops, if you believe that, you're idiots.

1366
01:38:48,120 --> 01:38:53,340
And just as believing the fact that if we let them go on this one, why don't we have

1367
01:38:53,340 --> 01:38:57,780
a Watergate style investigation of the entire Obama administration?

1368
01:38:57,780 --> 01:38:58,780
I agree.

1369
01:38:58,780 --> 01:39:02,340
They admit, it was done 1,000 times what Nixon did, 10,000 times.

1370
01:39:02,340 --> 01:39:06,500
They admit it's the cops holding up, going after the guns, cuz the cops know they're

1371
01:39:06,500 --> 01:39:10,220
gonna have their guns taken and the cops know it's gonna be a civil war.

1372
01:39:10,220 --> 01:39:13,340
Cops better protect us because the cops are next.

1373
01:39:13,340 --> 01:39:14,340
That's the point.

1374
01:39:14,340 --> 01:39:18,980
The Communist Chinese would be happy to come in here with their military and tell the local

1375
01:39:18,980 --> 01:39:20,500
law enforcement, we don't need you anymore.

1376
01:39:20,500 --> 01:39:22,500
Well, they'll tell them, turn your guns and then they're gonna kill them.

1377
01:39:22,500 --> 01:39:24,180
But look, you've got the NSA.

1378
01:39:24,180 --> 01:39:28,020
The NSA can read your emails, read my emails.

1379
01:39:28,020 --> 01:39:32,340
You mean they couldn't read the emails of HSBC laundering money?

1380
01:39:32,340 --> 01:39:36,980
They couldn't read the emails of the drug cartels coming across the border?

1381
01:39:36,980 --> 01:39:42,900
They couldn't read the emails from Ambassador Stevens saying, we're not protected here running

1382
01:39:42,900 --> 01:39:45,340
guns without kind of taking over.

1383
01:39:45,340 --> 01:39:49,380
You talk to a lot of corporate and government people, are they concerned right now?

1384
01:39:49,380 --> 01:39:53,780
Increasingly, because again, the corporations, the whole idea is, well, corporations will

1385
01:39:53,780 --> 01:39:54,780
be fine in globalism.

1386
01:39:54,780 --> 01:39:57,260
They use all the labor from China.

1387
01:39:57,260 --> 01:40:00,300
So they don't need American labor.

1388
01:40:00,300 --> 01:40:02,460
American labor is useless.

1389
01:40:02,460 --> 01:40:04,500
It's a detail.

1390
01:40:04,500 --> 01:40:06,860
Don't need expensive American or European-

1391
01:40:06,860 --> 01:40:09,380
Don't all these rich people know they're gonna get double-crossed?

1392
01:40:09,380 --> 01:40:11,180
That's the whole point.

1393
01:40:11,180 --> 01:40:13,220
You're not gonna be safe by being ignorant.

1394
01:40:13,220 --> 01:40:14,220
They're idiots.

1395
01:40:14,220 --> 01:40:15,220
You're not gonna be-

1396
01:40:15,220 --> 01:40:17,260
The governing class is gonna slit their throats.

1397
01:40:17,260 --> 01:40:21,180
And this is the big move towards globalism.

1398
01:40:21,180 --> 01:40:25,860
It's the one chance where they think if they can just bankrupt the United States, eliminate

1399
01:40:25,860 --> 01:40:28,940
the military, step by step, China will move in.

1400
01:40:28,940 --> 01:40:32,940
We become a colony to Communist China.

1401
01:40:32,940 --> 01:40:34,460
We become the globalists.

1402
01:40:34,460 --> 01:40:36,860
That's why Dinesh D'Souza's film gets it wrong.

1403
01:40:36,860 --> 01:40:41,580
It's not that Obama hates nation states and is an anti-colonialist.

1404
01:40:41,580 --> 01:40:44,060
Well, no, he does hate nation states.

1405
01:40:44,060 --> 01:40:49,780
It's that this is a reverse colonialism of the globalist and collectivist governing class

1406
01:40:49,780 --> 01:40:53,980
to get rid of the nations and create a giant world government.

1407
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:59,100
Even when the Georgetown professor says the Constitution's an old document, ignore it.

1408
01:40:59,100 --> 01:41:03,700
Because they think nation states, God, they think God is old.

1409
01:41:03,700 --> 01:41:05,180
How is D'Souza's film wrong?

1410
01:41:05,180 --> 01:41:09,940
Well, D'Souza's film is wrong in that we want to colonialize America.

1411
01:41:09,940 --> 01:41:10,940
Obama-

1412
01:41:10,940 --> 01:41:11,940
That's right.

1413
01:41:11,940 --> 01:41:12,940
America's been colonialized by the globalists.

1414
01:41:12,940 --> 01:41:16,140
Obama doesn't mind colonialism as long as he's the one doing the colonizing.

1415
01:41:16,140 --> 01:41:17,140
Exactly.

1416
01:41:17,140 --> 01:41:18,140
It's a total lie.

1417
01:41:18,140 --> 01:41:21,140
Globalism is corporate colonization using communist methods.

1418
01:41:21,140 --> 01:41:24,820
Let the banks do it because the banks will control the money.

1419
01:41:24,820 --> 01:41:28,660
If England thinks it's going to vote out of the EU, they're not going to get a chance

1420
01:41:28,660 --> 01:41:29,660
to do that.

1421
01:41:29,660 --> 01:41:30,900
That's not going to happen.

1422
01:41:30,900 --> 01:41:34,980
The EU, again, bankrupting the EU, bankrupting-

1423
01:41:34,980 --> 01:41:37,280
And their own documents admit it was designed to bankrupt.

1424
01:41:37,280 --> 01:41:42,820
It puts more power in the hands of the global bankers who want to say, we'll be just fine.

1425
01:41:42,820 --> 01:41:45,940
And the EU bureaucrats are all exempt from the taxes.

1426
01:41:45,940 --> 01:41:46,940
Look at the money.

1427
01:41:46,940 --> 01:41:47,940
Same deal.

1428
01:41:47,940 --> 01:41:52,340
The only money in the United States today is held by the Chinese of the richest country

1429
01:41:52,340 --> 01:41:53,340
in the world.

1430
01:41:53,340 --> 01:41:57,260
The drug cartels have more money than the corporations of the federal government.

1431
01:41:57,260 --> 01:41:59,900
The federal government has been intentionally bankrupt.

1432
01:41:59,900 --> 01:42:01,340
A criminal takeover.

1433
01:42:01,340 --> 01:42:02,340
Criminal takeover.

1434
01:42:02,340 --> 01:42:04,700
It's a criminal takeover by the globalists of the federal government.

1435
01:42:04,700 --> 01:42:06,420
And they're just criminals.

1436
01:42:06,420 --> 01:42:08,300
That's why they use criminal tactics.

1437
01:42:08,300 --> 01:42:10,700
Obama is heading a coup d'etat from within.

1438
01:42:10,700 --> 01:42:14,420
A criminal cartel, foreign criminal cartel coup d'etat.

1439
01:42:14,420 --> 01:42:18,300
We are, the United States government is the drug cartel.

1440
01:42:18,300 --> 01:42:19,900
We are the drug cartels.

1441
01:42:19,900 --> 01:42:22,020
We are Al-Qaeda.

1442
01:42:22,020 --> 01:42:23,140
We're funding Al-Qaeda.

1443
01:42:23,140 --> 01:42:26,460
We're putting guns- Again, the criminal groups that have come in and hijacked are.

1444
01:42:26,460 --> 01:42:27,460
Right.

1445
01:42:27,460 --> 01:42:28,460
And killing Qaddafi.

1446
01:42:28,460 --> 01:42:30,860
I mean, Obama, why did Obama turn on Qaddafi?

1447
01:42:30,860 --> 01:42:32,340
He'd come in and worked with him.

1448
01:42:32,340 --> 01:42:35,780
Qaddafi funded Obama through Louis Farrakhan.

1449
01:42:35,780 --> 01:42:37,540
Reverend Wright met with Qaddafi.

1450
01:42:37,540 --> 01:42:39,500
He funded Sarkozy.

1451
01:42:39,500 --> 01:42:40,580
That's even come out in the news.

1452
01:42:40,580 --> 01:42:44,340
And then Obama turns- They double-crossed their own guy.

1453
01:42:44,340 --> 01:42:48,220
Grew Qaddafi to the wolves because he had Al-Qaeda coming to the floor.

1454
01:42:48,220 --> 01:42:52,820
Al-Qaeda's taken over all the criminal groups- Which, again, is Saudi Arabia.

1455
01:42:52,820 --> 01:42:54,300
The whole idea- That's the deal.

1456
01:42:54,300 --> 01:42:57,980
The whole idea this Arab Spring- Turn everything over to the Saudis.

1457
01:42:57,980 --> 01:43:03,140
Only more of the Muslim Brotherhood, the radicals, taking over all of North Africa.

1458
01:43:03,140 --> 01:43:08,600
So it's Saudi Arabia, the communist Chinese, and the mega banks all teamed up against any

1459
01:43:08,600 --> 01:43:09,700
country they don't control.

1460
01:43:09,700 --> 01:43:11,500
Any country they don't control.

1461
01:43:11,500 --> 01:43:14,980
And bankrupting the United States people, making the United States people feel like

1462
01:43:14,980 --> 01:43:18,700
if they don't get their social security checks, look at the number of people that are on the

1463
01:43:18,700 --> 01:43:21,100
verge of bankruptcy in the United States.

1464
01:43:21,100 --> 01:43:23,340
Number of people facing losing their homes.

1465
01:43:23,340 --> 01:43:26,680
The plan is to take the homes away from Americans.

1466
01:43:26,680 --> 01:43:28,340
And nationalize that.

1467
01:43:28,340 --> 01:43:31,260
Plan is to reduce Americans to poverty.

1468
01:43:31,260 --> 01:43:36,620
And this whole Claubert Piven theory is a conscious attempt to bankrupt the United States

1469
01:43:36,620 --> 01:43:38,980
in order for globalists to gain power.

1470
01:43:38,980 --> 01:43:40,540
It's domestication for slaughter.

1471
01:43:40,540 --> 01:43:43,140
Dr. Corsi, you've got to go catch an airplane.

1472
01:43:43,140 --> 01:43:45,820
We're going to have you back on very, very soon when the new book comes out.

1473
01:43:45,820 --> 01:43:48,660
In fact, I want to tell Weldon Henson back there over our department.

1474
01:43:48,660 --> 01:43:51,660
I want to carry- Bad Samaritans, bad Samaritans, you'll have

1475
01:43:51,660 --> 01:43:52,660
it.

1476
01:43:52,660 --> 01:43:53,660
I want to carry all your new books.

1477
01:43:53,660 --> 01:43:55,740
All right, Dr. Corsi, thank you for being with us.

1478
01:43:55,740 --> 01:43:56,980
Alex, you're doing God's work.

1479
01:43:56,980 --> 01:43:57,980
Keep it up.

1480
01:43:57,980 --> 01:43:58,980
Thank you, sir.

1481
01:43:58,980 --> 01:43:59,980
Wow.

1482
01:43:59,980 --> 01:44:01,300
Ladies and gentlemen, he's got to leave us to go get on an airplane.

1483
01:44:01,300 --> 01:44:02,300
There it goes.

1484
01:44:02,300 --> 01:44:05,100
Dr. Corsi will help him get unhooked in here.

1485
01:44:05,100 --> 01:44:11,260
And just amazing times that we live in, absolutely amazing times.

1486
01:44:11,260 --> 01:44:12,260
And I've studied history.

1487
01:44:12,260 --> 01:44:17,180
I became obsessed with history when I was about 10 years old and became a good reader.

1488
01:44:17,180 --> 01:44:20,180
And I've studied communism, fascism, socialism.

1489
01:44:20,180 --> 01:44:24,780
I've read the books of Dr. Carol Quigley, the books of the White House Science Czar,

1490
01:44:24,780 --> 01:44:30,700
the books of the Rockefellers, their foundations, their statements, everything that they stand

1491
01:44:30,700 --> 01:44:31,700
for.

1492
01:44:31,700 --> 01:44:33,800
And their game plan is 100% public.

1493
01:44:33,800 --> 01:44:36,780
So when people ask, how do I know that TSA was coming to Austin?

1494
01:44:36,780 --> 01:44:39,820
Well, they've announced they're gonna be in every city, and now they're here running checkpoints

1495
01:44:39,820 --> 01:44:40,820
on the road.

1496
01:44:40,820 --> 01:44:42,340
I also have my police sources.

1497
01:44:42,340 --> 01:44:46,300
I mean, people ask, how did I know they'd start putting smart meters on with armed police?

1498
01:44:46,300 --> 01:44:47,620
Well, they announced they would.

1499
01:44:47,620 --> 01:44:51,500
How did I know they would start double and triple charging during peak times with smart

1500
01:44:51,500 --> 01:44:52,500
meters?

1501
01:44:52,500 --> 01:44:56,660
And then smart meters would dial in to all the new appliances 15 years ago.

1502
01:44:56,660 --> 01:45:00,300
And now it's just happening, cuz it was all MIT documents.

1503
01:45:00,300 --> 01:45:05,260
You can't go buy a dishwasher now, or any major appliance that doesn't have Bluetooth

1504
01:45:05,260 --> 01:45:09,900
or wireless hookups, TVs, you name it, with cameras on them, dialing in through the smart

1505
01:45:09,900 --> 01:45:12,620
meter, watching and listening to you.

1506
01:45:12,620 --> 01:45:16,820
I mean, it's beyond 1984.

1507
01:45:16,820 --> 01:45:21,300
Cancer viruses and the vaccines, thousands of documents, sterilizing people, killing

1508
01:45:21,300 --> 01:45:22,300
people.

1509
01:45:22,300 --> 01:45:25,420
I mean, we're living in a stinking nightmare, but it's all scientifically rolled out.

1510
01:45:25,420 --> 01:45:29,580
And 95% of the government people in corporate don't know all this.

1511
01:45:29,580 --> 01:45:31,460
That's why they haven't killed me.

1512
01:45:31,460 --> 01:45:34,260
Because it's all a joke, go listen to that loud Texan.

1513
01:45:34,260 --> 01:45:36,580
Wouldn't you be loud if all this was true and you knew it?

1514
01:45:36,580 --> 01:45:38,220
Well, it is true.

1515
01:45:38,220 --> 01:45:41,980
Of course I'm upset, man, I'm on the front lines of this thing.

1516
01:45:41,980 --> 01:45:46,440
And if you'll just get out of your stinking coma, we can turn this thing around.

1517
01:45:46,440 --> 01:45:50,580
Now I wanna make a big announcement, Roger, I have to skip this network break.

1518
01:45:50,580 --> 01:45:54,140
You know what, I'll make the announcement with this video, and then come back and make

1519
01:45:54,140 --> 01:45:55,700
some other comments.

1520
01:45:55,700 --> 01:46:01,500
The video just went up at infowars.com with the contest details and rules.

1521
01:46:01,500 --> 01:46:09,700
It's all up at infowars.com right now, red linked in the featured news area and at prisonplanet.com.

1522
01:46:09,700 --> 01:46:13,060
Infowars launches operation Paul Revere.

1523
01:46:13,060 --> 01:46:18,020
Here it is, this will be a huge blow against the globalists, here it is.

1524
01:46:18,020 --> 01:46:25,860
If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.

1525
01:46:25,860 --> 01:46:31,580
Fellow freedom lovers, Alex Jones here with the biggest contest announcement we've ever

1526
01:46:31,580 --> 01:46:32,580
made.

1527
01:46:32,580 --> 01:46:35,220
This is so incredibly exciting.

1528
01:46:35,220 --> 01:46:39,860
We are launching operation Paul Revere.

1529
01:46:39,860 --> 01:46:41,420
What did Paul Revere do?

1530
01:46:41,420 --> 01:46:49,020
He rode through the countryside in New England saying, to arms, to arms, the redcoats are

1531
01:46:49,020 --> 01:46:50,020
coming.

1532
01:46:50,020 --> 01:46:51,780
One is by land, two is by sea.

1533
01:46:51,780 --> 01:46:56,340
And all that evil men and tyrants need to flourish is that good men and women do nothing.

1534
01:46:56,340 --> 01:47:05,340
Let me officially announce operation Paul Revere, a $100,000 cash first place winner

1535
01:47:05,340 --> 01:47:09,260
to be judged by yours truly, Alex Jones.

1536
01:47:09,260 --> 01:47:12,420
The film can be three minutes, it can be up to two hours.

1537
01:47:12,420 --> 01:47:16,580
It can be fiction, nonfiction, documentary, drama.

1538
01:47:16,580 --> 01:47:21,680
It's got to promote liberty and freedom and expose tyranny and oppression.

1539
01:47:21,680 --> 01:47:25,260
And it's not just people in the US that can enter, it's folks worldwide.

1540
01:47:25,260 --> 01:47:29,900
The rules, the details are at infowars.com forward slash contest.

1541
01:47:29,900 --> 01:47:35,100
You have to read the rules and officially sign up for this because it's a $100,000 prize

1542
01:47:35,100 --> 01:47:40,820
first place, $10,000 second place, $5,000 third place.

1543
01:47:40,820 --> 01:47:45,860
But just as I did last year with a reporter contest, we are going to crowdsource from

1544
01:47:45,860 --> 01:47:52,400
the pool of incredible talent out there and hire several official crews to be directors

1545
01:47:52,400 --> 01:47:59,140
and writers and camera people in infowars.com produced major films and documentaries that

1546
01:47:59,140 --> 01:48:03,140
will be put in movie theaters and on cable and I've got all the connections to get it

1547
01:48:03,140 --> 01:48:04,140
done.

1548
01:48:04,140 --> 01:48:06,340
So we're going to really give the new world order hell.

1549
01:48:06,340 --> 01:48:07,340
This is extremely exciting.

1550
01:48:07,340 --> 01:48:10,960
I've made over 20 films, one of them alone has reached more than 40 million people on

1551
01:48:10,960 --> 01:48:12,280
YouTube and Google Video.

1552
01:48:12,280 --> 01:48:17,180
The Obama deception, Endgame, Father of Public, Road to Tyranny.

1553
01:48:17,180 --> 01:48:21,120
Films are the most effective thing I do, but they're very time consuming.

1554
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:26,820
And so I want to turn the power of we the people loose here and your art, your research,

1555
01:48:26,820 --> 01:48:29,780
your ideas are unstoppable.

1556
01:48:29,780 --> 01:48:35,500
We're officially kicking the contest off this Friday and you've got a little more than three

1557
01:48:35,500 --> 01:48:42,420
months until April 30th, just a little more than three months to produce your documentary

1558
01:48:42,420 --> 01:48:48,020
or your film and get it out and it will absolutely reach tens of millions of people.

1559
01:48:48,020 --> 01:48:50,420
Our normal contest get about 500 entries.

1560
01:48:50,420 --> 01:48:52,460
That's what $10,000 prizes.

1561
01:48:52,460 --> 01:48:55,660
This is 10 times that 100,000 for first place.

1562
01:48:55,660 --> 01:48:57,420
That's one of the biggest contest out there.

1563
01:48:57,420 --> 01:49:01,780
In fact, it's the biggest next to Doritos that has $100,000.

1564
01:49:01,780 --> 01:49:08,260
This is huge, ladies and gentlemen, $115,000 in cash prizes and a shot to have your film

1565
01:49:08,260 --> 01:49:11,740
produced and financed by Infowars.com.

1566
01:49:11,740 --> 01:49:17,560
Edit it, upload it to YouTube and one other alternate public video site and send your

1567
01:49:17,560 --> 01:49:21,020
entry to Paul Revere at Infowars.com.

1568
01:49:21,020 --> 01:49:26,120
The animating contest of liberty that Thomas Jefferson talked about is happening right

1569
01:49:26,120 --> 01:49:27,120
now.

1570
01:49:27,120 --> 01:49:30,620
The modern battlefield is in the mind more than ever.

1571
01:49:30,620 --> 01:49:33,820
We use truth, the globalists use lies and deception.

1572
01:49:33,820 --> 01:49:38,380
The corruption and oppression and high tech police state is in our face, but the controllers

1573
01:49:38,380 --> 01:49:39,380
are scared.

1574
01:49:39,380 --> 01:49:43,180
They intended to use the Internet to dominate and control humanity and surveillance, but

1575
01:49:43,180 --> 01:49:45,640
we've turned their system against them.

1576
01:49:45,640 --> 01:49:51,780
This is a historic crossroads that we have reached and I ask you to ride in the year

1577
01:49:51,780 --> 01:49:58,140
2013, just as one of the founders of this republic did back in 1775.

1578
01:49:58,140 --> 01:50:04,780
I'm calling you to arms in the Infowar because the pen and the video camera is mightier than

1579
01:50:04,780 --> 01:50:05,780
the sword.

1580
01:50:05,780 --> 01:50:11,060
Let's go in there and rescue humanity and awaken them and set brush fires in the minds

1581
01:50:11,060 --> 01:50:12,380
of men and women everywhere.

1582
01:50:12,380 --> 01:50:16,060
Be part of this contest, you've got three months, put your hat in the ring.

1583
01:50:16,060 --> 01:50:19,360
Be part of the solution to the corruption and oppression.

1584
01:50:19,360 --> 01:50:21,700
Be part of the resistance to tyranny.

1585
01:50:21,700 --> 01:50:26,900
We're looking for the Paul Revere's that will drive a stake for the New World Order's wicked

1586
01:50:26,900 --> 01:50:27,900
heart.

1587
01:50:27,900 --> 01:50:32,740
All right, we're going to break and when we come back, I'll give you more details of this

1588
01:50:32,740 --> 01:50:34,700
and then I get into some of the other news.

1589
01:50:34,700 --> 01:50:38,900
But again, I'm even shaken up right now by how fast this is moving.

1590
01:50:38,900 --> 01:50:41,980
If you're a new listener and you're going, what is this all about?

1591
01:50:41,980 --> 01:50:44,120
Read history, read about tyranny.

1592
01:50:44,120 --> 01:50:45,120
That's what it's all about.

1593
01:50:45,120 --> 01:50:50,460
Okay, now, there will probably be 1000 entries to this, this will probably reach 100 million

1594
01:50:50,460 --> 01:50:51,460
people.

1595
01:50:51,460 --> 01:50:53,820
This will be the best 115,000 ever spent.

1596
01:50:53,820 --> 01:50:56,060
All of you win by entering the contest.

1597
01:50:56,060 --> 01:51:00,980
Get involved now, infowars.com has it red linked at the top.

1598
01:51:00,980 --> 01:51:04,720
If you've ever wanted one of our best selling generators, but we're waiting for an offer

1599
01:51:04,720 --> 01:51:09,660
so crazy you couldn't refuse, then you're not going to want to miss this exciting message.

1600
01:51:09,660 --> 01:51:10,660
Here's why.

1601
01:51:10,660 --> 01:51:16,000
Our solar generators provide life saving electrical power and unlike gas generators, solar generators

1602
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:20,400
run quietly, emit no fumes and produce electricity from the sun.

1603
01:51:20,400 --> 01:51:23,820
So when the lights go out, you'll always have the power you need.

1604
01:51:23,820 --> 01:51:29,080
Now here's the best part, every year we accumulate a few solar generators that we just can't

1605
01:51:29,080 --> 01:51:30,120
sell as new.

1606
01:51:30,120 --> 01:51:35,300
We put them in a special spot in our warehouse and we discount them heavily at the end of

1607
01:51:35,300 --> 01:51:36,300
each year.

1608
01:51:36,300 --> 01:51:40,020
We call them scratch and dent units, but they're really just like new.

1609
01:51:40,020 --> 01:51:45,260
Each unit comes with a full factory warranty and special bonuses you just won't believe.

1610
01:51:45,260 --> 01:51:46,780
Don't wait, they go fast.

1611
01:51:46,780 --> 01:51:50,660
Go to scratchanddentsolar.com, that's scratchanddentsolar.com.

1612
01:51:50,660 --> 01:52:01,180

1613
01:52:01,180 --> 01:52:04,720
Digestive health is the key to wellness and elimination of toxins.

1614
01:52:04,720 --> 01:52:06,100
That bears repeating.

1615
01:52:06,100 --> 01:52:09,620
Digestive health is the key to wellness and elimination of toxins.

1616
01:52:09,620 --> 01:52:14,140
And ProEM-1 daily probiotic cleanse is the key to digestive health.

1617
01:52:14,140 --> 01:52:19,420

1618

1620
01:52:25,100 --> 01:52:29,380

1622
01:52:32,900 --> 01:52:37,860
infections, is never freeze dried, and uses three groups of live viable beneficial microbes

1623
01:52:37,860 --> 01:52:39,500
to cleanse and remove toxins.

1624

1627
01:53:00,300 --> 01:53:04,580
We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water

1628
01:53:04,580 --> 01:53:05,580
filtration.

1629

Your own personal Jesus.

1643
01:54:38,740 --> 01:54:43,620
Monday through Friday, 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. central.

1644
01:54:43,620 --> 01:54:47,860
Again, any historian would look at what's happening and would say, my gosh, we're going

1645
01:54:47,860 --> 01:54:50,140
into total fascism.

1646
01:54:50,140 --> 01:54:54,420
But it's really eugenics, eugenicism, I've got to come up with a word for this.

1647
01:54:54,420 --> 01:54:57,440
It's a technocratic hell.

1648
01:54:57,440 --> 01:55:04,100
And everything, once you study it, is a psych warfare program to get you to submit to them.

1649
01:55:04,100 --> 01:55:05,820
And to get you to take on the idea that you're guilty.

1650
01:55:05,820 --> 01:55:10,620
I mean, look at these headlines up at infowars.com, you're a radio listener.

1651
01:55:10,620 --> 01:55:13,540
Airport terror announcements now being played in hotels.

1652
01:55:13,540 --> 01:55:17,340
And the article by Paul Watson and myself, we wrote this article together this morning.

1653
01:55:17,340 --> 01:55:20,620
Paul's already written three articles today, I don't tell him to do that.

1654
01:55:20,620 --> 01:55:26,100
He's passionate and works about 16 hours a day, because he understands how bad it is.

1655
01:55:26,100 --> 01:55:33,700
And when he's very clean cut, his family are very nice, well-spoken people that look even

1656
01:55:33,700 --> 01:55:35,660
aristocratic almost.

1657
01:55:35,660 --> 01:55:38,780
And they go out in London and walk down the street, the police walk over and ask who you

1658
01:55:38,780 --> 01:55:41,060
are, line up, you're a terrorist.

1659
01:55:41,060 --> 01:55:47,380
It's when you look handsome or smart, you're the enemy, okay?

1660
01:55:47,380 --> 01:55:49,940
It's when you care, the enemy senses it.

1661
01:55:49,940 --> 01:55:55,940
If you look like a zombie, that's how I know how to infiltrate things, cuz I can pull it

1662
01:55:55,940 --> 01:55:56,940
off.

1663
01:55:56,940 --> 01:56:00,700
I can actually get in the mode of a low IQ and gonna, and then the system doesn't even

1664
01:56:00,700 --> 01:56:01,700
notice you.

1665
01:56:01,700 --> 01:56:04,700
They hate you when you're strong.

1666
01:56:04,700 --> 01:56:08,980
And people like Watson and his brothers will be out with their wives or girlfriend, depending

1667
01:56:08,980 --> 01:56:09,980
on which one.

1668
01:56:09,980 --> 01:56:14,380
And it's just always the police come over and line up, gonna ask you some questions

1669
01:56:14,380 --> 01:56:16,340
that happened to me when I was in London.

1670
01:56:16,340 --> 01:56:21,280
And this is how they operate.

1671
01:56:21,280 --> 01:56:25,140
And they told me in England, they said, don't be here at the tube station, out on the street

1672
01:56:25,140 --> 01:56:26,140
at the entrance.

1673
01:56:26,140 --> 01:56:27,140
Don't ask people questions here.

1674
01:56:27,140 --> 01:56:29,220
Move along or we'll have you thrown out.

1675
01:56:29,220 --> 01:56:30,900
They do that to people that are born in England.

1676
01:56:30,900 --> 01:56:32,900
England's not a free country anymore.

1677
01:56:32,900 --> 01:56:34,420
Paul Watson knows that.

1678
01:56:34,420 --> 01:56:41,020
So he sits in his house, 16 hours a day conservatively, some days 18, fighting the New World Order

1679
01:56:41,020 --> 01:56:46,140
at a computer.

1680
01:56:46,140 --> 01:56:48,260
Because he understands and he doesn't like being a slave.

1681
01:56:48,260 --> 01:56:50,240
He doesn't like that it's getting worse every minute.

1682
01:56:50,240 --> 01:56:52,900
He doesn't like the oxygen is leaving the room.

1683
01:56:52,900 --> 01:57:00,540
He knows, it's like the old swashbuckler archeologist movies that came out in the 30s, 40s and 50s

1684
01:57:00,540 --> 01:57:04,900
that Indiana Jones Raiders of the Lost Ark is based on.

1685
01:57:04,900 --> 01:57:08,100
Where you're in the temple and the water's coming in rising up, you've got to get out

1686
01:57:08,100 --> 01:57:12,700
of your debt or the walls are coming in on you or sands pouring in.

1687
01:57:12,700 --> 01:57:15,220
We got to get out of this.

1688
01:57:15,220 --> 01:57:20,620
And I'll be driving home looking at the trees, looking at the moon, the beauty of the world,

1689
01:57:20,620 --> 01:57:21,780
loving my wife, my children.

1690
01:57:21,780 --> 01:57:24,820
I don't want to die.

1691
01:57:24,820 --> 01:57:25,820
I don't want to die.

1692
01:57:25,820 --> 01:57:30,300
I mean, I know there's a probability they'll kill me or put me in prison.

1693
01:57:30,300 --> 01:57:33,940
I mean, I wish I wasn't right.

1694
01:57:33,940 --> 01:57:39,220
I wish I wasn't having to be up here launching a huge contest with hundreds of films to defeat

1695
01:57:39,220 --> 01:57:40,300
the enemy.

1696
01:57:40,300 --> 01:57:45,260
I wish I didn't have to be so effective because you know how dangerous that is?

1697
01:57:45,260 --> 01:57:47,380
I destroyed Piers Morgan, the proofs of the pudding.

1698
01:57:47,380 --> 01:57:49,160
They won't have me on any other shows.

1699
01:57:49,160 --> 01:57:52,580
They're scared to death.

1700
01:57:52,580 --> 01:57:56,900
Because they know I'll shake people out of their coma, not because I'm anybody special,

1701
01:57:56,900 --> 01:57:59,880
but because I am primitive.

1702
01:57:59,880 --> 01:58:01,140
It's a primitive response.

1703
01:58:01,140 --> 01:58:04,720
They don't want you in your normal response to being oppressed to go, I'm not your slave.

1704
01:58:04,720 --> 01:58:07,860
They want you to just go along with it, comply.

1705
01:58:07,860 --> 01:58:10,400
Now is the time to get involved.

1706
01:58:10,400 --> 01:58:12,080
Now is the time to take on the globalists.

1707
01:58:12,080 --> 01:58:17,380
Now is the time to decide for what you serve, evil or good.

1708
01:58:17,380 --> 01:58:24,020
And by the way, if we defend liberty, all the prosperity will come back.

1709
01:58:24,020 --> 01:58:25,300
That's the thing.

1710
01:58:25,300 --> 01:58:27,880
All of you that are part of the power structure and think this is going to be a beautiful

1711

dark ride and you've got these visions of yourself with all these powers of the state,

1712

1720

used daily to prevent bacteria, viruses, mold and food poisoning and help improve wound

1721

healing.

1724
01:59:21,420 --> 01:59:23,000
other harmful pathogens.

1725
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:27,880
This new technology has the ability to terminate entire colonies of harmful bacteria at several

1726
01:59:27,880 --> 01:59:32,020
hundred times the effectiveness of colloidal or ionic silver solutions.

1727
01:59:32,020 --> 01:59:35,700
The Science Digest Journal says silver is our mightiest germ fighter.

01:59:53,820 --> 02:00:05,620
Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.

1732
02:00:05,620 --> 02:00:10,460
Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.

You want answers?

1734
02:00:11,460 --> 02:00:13,620
Well, so does he.

1735
02:00:13,620 --> 02:00:21,740
He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.

1736
02:00:21,740 --> 02:00:32,460
I want to look at the mass shootings in this country that have slightly increased the last

1737
02:00:32,460 --> 02:00:33,460
20 years.

1738
02:00:33,460 --> 02:00:38,260
I say slightly increased because they're still incredibly rare, but it's one of the only

1739
02:00:38,260 --> 02:00:40,300
violent crime statistics going up.

1740
02:00:40,300 --> 02:00:47,580
In fact, we can reload those statistics from FBI.gov that Melissa Melton collated in that

1741
02:00:47,580 --> 02:00:51,180
slide show when Armistice Ben Fuchs joins us.

1742
02:00:51,180 --> 02:00:54,660
Because I was listening to his show, I think it was Tuesday or Wednesday.

1743
02:00:54,660 --> 02:00:56,860
And I actually sat in the car because I used to get ready at home.

1744
02:00:56,860 --> 02:01:02,260
I sat in the car as I was driving into the office and I only got here about 40 minutes

1745
02:01:02,260 --> 02:01:06,340
before airtime, but I sat there for about 10 minutes wanting to listen to what he was

1746
02:01:06,340 --> 02:01:07,340
saying.

1747
02:01:07,340 --> 02:01:13,980
Cuz I've interviewed so many brain surgeons, endocrinologists, different scientists, that

1748
02:01:13,980 --> 02:01:16,780
I knew everything he was saying was true, it was just reminding me of it all.

1749
02:01:16,780 --> 02:01:21,340
But he was putting it together so concisely and I said, can you come on Friday, I'll talk

1750
02:01:21,340 --> 02:01:22,340
about this when we come back.

1751
02:01:22,340 --> 02:01:29,860
I said, can you send me something on drug interactions with SSRIs or SRIs and mass murdering

1752
02:01:29,860 --> 02:01:30,860
and killing?

1753
02:01:30,860 --> 02:01:35,420
That's what he sent me, all these documents and articles and inserts as a pharmacist,

1754
02:01:35,420 --> 02:01:38,780
a compounding pharmacist, one of the most successful in Colorado, he was a mainline

1755
02:01:38,780 --> 02:01:39,780
pharmacist before that.

1756
02:01:39,780 --> 02:01:43,780
That guy looks 20 years younger than he is, but I got some other questions about allergies.

1757
02:01:43,780 --> 02:01:49,860
I wanna ask him after that, cuz I've been on longevity steadily, but only a few of the

1758
02:01:49,860 --> 02:01:50,860
products.

1759
02:01:50,860 --> 02:01:53,420
I've never been a big supplement person, I'm just not in the habit for about a year and

1760
02:01:53,420 --> 02:01:55,780
I've lost about 25, 30 pounds.

1761
02:01:55,780 --> 02:02:00,620
It was about 40, but I gained some back cuz I never remember to do it all.

1762
02:02:00,620 --> 02:02:05,080
And my muscle levels gone up, standing there naked in my bathroom, I look a lot better

1763
02:02:05,080 --> 02:02:07,460
than I used to.

1764
02:02:07,460 --> 02:02:12,260
But the muscle weighs a couple times more than fat, so there's been that conversion.

1765
02:02:12,260 --> 02:02:17,420
But what do I do with supplements?

1766
02:02:17,420 --> 02:02:21,300
By the way, a university study on the M4's health supplements here that just came out

1767
02:02:21,300 --> 02:02:25,060
from Yahoo Finance, just about how amazing they are.

1768
02:02:25,060 --> 02:02:28,840
This is groundbreaking stuff, I wouldn't be promoting it.

1769
02:02:28,840 --> 02:02:35,460
And my mountain juniper, they call it cedar allergy, that plagues half of Austin on average,

1770
02:02:35,460 --> 02:02:41,780
has gotten so bad living here for 20 something years, since high school, 22 years.

1771
02:02:41,780 --> 02:02:47,620
And most plants pop during the spring or summer.

1772
02:02:47,620 --> 02:02:51,500
This thing goes off in the winter, December, January, February.

1773
02:02:51,500 --> 02:02:59,060
It's so bad this year that I'm talking about going to Seattle or Miami Beach or somewhere

1774
02:02:59,060 --> 02:03:02,300
for those months to do the show next year, because it's a living hell.

1775
02:03:02,300 --> 02:03:04,540
So I wanna ask him, are there supplements?

1776
02:03:04,540 --> 02:03:05,540
What can I do?

1777
02:03:05,540 --> 02:03:09,180
And I've just gotta get religious, cuz every time I do what he says, it works.

1778
02:03:09,180 --> 02:03:15,500
Look at Aaron, lost 95 pounds without going into one of those clinics and taking speed.

1779
02:03:15,500 --> 02:03:20,700
My wife's had dramatic response, my mother, my dad, if I will just follow this, then I'll

1780
02:03:20,700 --> 02:03:21,700
have a great response.

1781
02:03:21,700 --> 02:03:27,640
So I'm gonna come back and get into the shootings and how he recommends people are able to phase

1782
02:03:27,640 --> 02:03:31,140
off of serotonin reuptake inhibitors, cuz going right off of them, the inserts tell

1783
02:03:31,140 --> 02:03:35,620
you, that'll make even go more daffy duck where he bounces around and shoots off into

1784
02:03:35,620 --> 02:03:39,780
the atmosphere or over the horizon.

1785
02:03:39,780 --> 02:03:44,120
So I'm no medical doctor, the medical doctors we've had on, and the psychologists, psychiatrists

1786
02:03:44,120 --> 02:03:47,860
have said that are awake, do not go off East cold turkey.

1787
02:03:47,860 --> 02:03:51,060
Whatever you do, I'm not giving that advice, that's what they say.

1788
02:03:51,060 --> 02:03:54,820
I'm not giving any medical advice here, I'm just going off the research and what I would

1789
02:03:54,820 --> 02:03:55,820
do.

1790
02:03:55,820 --> 02:03:59,620
So we're gonna talk about the mass shootings, how to get off of it, and then natural things

1791
02:03:59,620 --> 02:04:04,580
that the, by the way, the FDA wants to ban, that in the placebo studies I've seen five,

1792
02:04:04,580 --> 02:04:09,500
six, seven, eight, ten times more effective in some cases.

1793
02:04:09,500 --> 02:04:16,500
And it's not just melatonin, so also good news for people that are depressed or whatever.

1794
02:04:16,500 --> 02:04:20,140
So this, we're all about solutions here, so that's why he's gonna be joining us.

1795
02:04:20,140 --> 02:04:24,600
And also, we're gonna do some midair refueling, when you buy the quality, longevity products

1796
02:04:24,600 --> 02:04:30,620
discounted at the lowest price available at mfowarshealth.com or mfowarestore.com.

1797
02:04:30,620 --> 02:04:33,820
You get stuff like free shipping when you sign up for auto ship, you can sign up and

1798
02:04:33,820 --> 02:04:38,660
pay 10 bucks, get discounts to be a distributor, get distributor prices, wholesale prices.

1799
02:04:38,660 --> 02:04:44,440
When you do that, it funds mfowars operation, so we can have $100,000 contest, people to

1800
02:04:44,440 --> 02:04:47,700
make films to wake up America, operation Paul Revere.

1801
02:04:47,700 --> 02:04:52,140
So the funding that comes in lets us continue and expand and do more aggressive stuff in

1802
02:04:52,140 --> 02:04:53,140
the face of the new world order.

1803
02:04:53,140 --> 02:04:56,100
Because if I'm gonna get killed fighting these people, which I hope doesn't happen, knock

1804
02:04:56,100 --> 02:05:01,300
on wood, pray to Jesus, I'm gonna go all the way.

1805
02:05:01,300 --> 02:05:06,540

It really says that the state is God.

1822
02:06:12,500 --> 02:06:17,060
The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states

1823
02:06:17,060 --> 02:06:18,280
on earth.

1824
02:06:18,280 --> 02:06:23,100

expanded nationwide.

powerful shadow state.

1831
02:06:45,300 --> 02:06:48,800

1832
02:06:48,800 --> 02:06:50,820
The police state isn't coming.

1833

1835
02:07:00,600 --> 02:07:05,580
Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive from natural disasters

1836
02:07:05,580 --> 02:07:10,180
like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on

1837
02:07:10,180 --> 02:07:12,040
by a disastrous economy?

1838
02:07:12,040 --> 02:07:14,740
Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything.

1839
02:07:14,740 --> 02:07:18,540
At E Foods Direct, we hear from customers every day that are fortunate enough to weather

1840
02:07:18,540 --> 02:07:21,460
life's storm by having a supply of food on hand.

1841
02:07:21,460 --> 02:07:26,020
After Hurricane Sandy, Danny from New York City wrote, almost all the grocery stores

1842
02:07:26,020 --> 02:07:30,820
are closed, but I managed to get my E Foods just in time to be able to help my sister

1843
02:07:30,820 --> 02:07:31,820
and niece.

1844
02:07:31,820 --> 02:07:35,620
It is better to be prepared 10 years too early than one day too late.

1853
02:08:55,580 --> 02:08:59,580
of the New World Order are spreading across the planet.

1854
02:08:59,580 --> 02:09:03,580
Every form of tyranny is exploding into huge flames

1855
02:09:03,580 --> 02:09:07,580
and it's generating all that is good.

1856
02:09:07,580 --> 02:09:11,580
The general public is under scientific conditioning,

1857
02:09:11,580 --> 02:09:15,580
completely programmed. It's up to us not to laugh at them

1858
02:09:15,580 --> 02:09:19,580
or to even get angry with them. It's up to us to shake them out of their trance.

1859
02:09:19,580 --> 02:09:23,580
To shake them out of the spell. To awaken

1860
02:09:23,580 --> 02:09:27,580
the brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere. That's why we've launched

1861
02:09:27,580 --> 02:09:31,580
Operation Awaken the Sleeping Giant

1862
02:09:31,580 --> 02:09:35,580
where you can get 11 prisonplanet.tv memberships

1863
02:09:35,580 --> 02:09:39,580
for the price of one, $5.95 a month. That's less than $0.59

1864
02:09:39,580 --> 02:09:43,580
per person per month. You can create a username and passcode, give it

1865
02:09:43,580 --> 02:09:47,580
to up to 10 more people. And that many can be simultaneously

1866
02:09:47,580 --> 02:09:51,580
logged on to see the nightly news, to see all my films, to hear the show.

1867
02:09:51,580 --> 02:09:55,580
We're having a huge effect already. But quite frankly, Operation Awaken the Sleeping Giant

1868
02:09:55,580 --> 02:09:59,580
is nothing compared to Operation Paul Revere

1869
02:09:59,580 --> 02:10:03,580
launched about 25 minutes ago, last hour

1870
02:10:03,580 --> 02:10:07,580
at prisonplanet.com and at infowars.com

1871
02:10:07,580 --> 02:10:11,580
Operation Paul Revere, Operation Paul Revere

1872
02:10:11,580 --> 02:10:15,580
to just absolutely turn loose, tens of thousands

1873
02:10:15,580 --> 02:10:19,580
they have tens of thousands of entries for the Doritos contest

1874
02:10:19,580 --> 02:10:23,580
$100,000 for a stupid Doritos MSG ad.

1875
02:10:23,580 --> 02:10:27,580
Okay, this is $100,000 first place cash.

1876
02:10:27,580 --> 02:10:31,580
So you've got to jump through more stuff with the Doritos. It's got to air, it's got to get certain ratings

1877
02:10:31,580 --> 02:10:35,580
on the Super Bowl, sometimes it doesn't so you don't get all the money. This is just $100,000

1878
02:10:35,580 --> 02:10:39,580
I judge it. You've got three months to produce

1879
02:10:39,580 --> 02:10:43,580
the film. It can be three minutes long or two hours long. Three minutes to two hours

1880
02:10:43,580 --> 02:10:47,580
that's the area. It can be fiction, non-fiction. It's got to expose tyranny, promote

1881
02:10:47,580 --> 02:10:51,580
liberty. The rules are up at infowars.com. And all of you

1882
02:10:51,580 --> 02:10:55,580
will win by exposing the globalist. We're launching this right now.

1883
02:10:55,580 --> 02:10:59,580
All of us will win by resisting. Thousands of films are going to get made. It's going to flood

1884
02:10:59,580 --> 02:11:03,580
YouTube and one other online free video site.

1885
02:11:03,580 --> 02:11:07,580
Pick the other. Pick whichever one you want.

1886
02:11:07,580 --> 02:11:11,580
And just flood the internet. We all win. It's a giant rush.

1887
02:11:11,580 --> 02:11:15,580
It's Operation Paul Revere. Ride out as Paul Revere. I mean one example

1888
02:11:15,580 --> 02:11:19,580
of a film is you could dress up like Paul Revere and actually ride around in the city at night

1889
02:11:19,580 --> 02:11:23,580
warning people that tyranny is happening and handing out from horseback documents

1890
02:11:23,580 --> 02:11:27,580
about the new world order takeover. I'm not saying that'll be the winner. It's just there's unlimited

1891
02:11:27,580 --> 02:11:31,580
ideas. I'm actually planning to do that. I just if I get the time. I've got a thousand

1892
02:11:31,580 --> 02:11:35,580
ideas. I know how to bring these people down. I know how to turn you loose. You know

1893
02:11:35,580 --> 02:11:39,580
how to turn yourself loose. Operation Paul Revere.

1894
02:11:39,580 --> 02:11:43,580
Operation Paul Revere. Operation Paul Revere.

1895
02:11:43,580 --> 02:11:47,580
Operation Paul Revere. Launch. Dropped. And again taking

1896
02:11:47,580 --> 02:11:51,580
the capital that comes in. What's the best thing we can do? Launch a news program. Make

1897
02:11:51,580 --> 02:11:55,580
films. Come out with a magazine. Make viral reports.

1898
02:11:55,580 --> 02:11:59,580
I mean I get 15 million listeners conservatively

1899
02:11:59,580 --> 02:12:03,580
every week and that's growing. That's an old number. 140 stations.

1900
02:12:03,580 --> 02:12:07,580
Gaining a couple new ones a week. In fact I've got news stations I'm supposed to plug today. The week's gone by.

1901
02:12:07,580 --> 02:12:11,580
I mean it's incredible. We're having an effect. And with good cheer

1902
02:12:11,580 --> 02:12:15,580
I stand against the enemy. If they kill me or set me up or whatever

1903
02:12:15,580 --> 02:12:19,580
take care of my family. Keep the Infowars operation going. We've got a plan for that.

1904
02:12:19,580 --> 02:12:23,580
But don't. But understand that's a sign of victory against the enemy.

1905
02:12:23,580 --> 02:12:27,580
I hope that doesn't happen. The reason they have it is because they don't want to underline and highlight everything

1906
02:12:27,580 --> 02:12:31,580
I've said. The point is that this is a fight. This is the fight I was born for.

1907
02:12:31,580 --> 02:12:35,580
This is the fight you were born for. You're not meant to just watch TV and drink

1908
02:12:35,580 --> 02:12:39,580
beer all day and have a good time and then get euthanized at some government facility.

1909
02:12:39,580 --> 02:12:43,580
You're not meant to be some bureaucrat feeding on people all day. You're not meant

1910
02:12:43,580 --> 02:12:47,580
to live like this. You're not meant to put your kids on Prozac

1911
02:12:47,580 --> 02:12:51,580
and Ritalin. We're not meant to live like this. And this is the animating

1912
02:12:51,580 --> 02:12:55,580
contest for liberty. I'm not happy about the tyranny getting so obvious

1913
02:12:55,580 --> 02:12:59,580
because I know how dark it is. But you know what? If that's the case, good. It's now out in the open.

1914
02:12:59,580 --> 02:13:03,580
Okay.

1915
02:13:03,580 --> 02:13:07,580
We're going to go now for the balance of the hour to one of my favorite guests

1916
02:13:07,580 --> 02:13:11,580
and one of our listeners' favorite guest. He is

1917
02:13:11,580 --> 02:13:15,580
pharmacist Ben Fuchs. He was a mainline pharmacist for many years

1918
02:13:15,580 --> 02:13:19,580
until he saw what it was doing to people. And he's developed many

1919
02:13:19,580 --> 02:13:23,580
different products, different vitamin and mineral

1920
02:13:23,580 --> 02:13:27,580
systems, skin systems, you name it. He's the host of the nationally syndicated radio program

1921
02:13:27,580 --> 02:13:31,580
on GCN, The Bright Side. The Bright Side, again, is on GCN the hour before

1922
02:13:31,580 --> 02:13:35,580
I am. Fuchs is a registered pharmacist, nutritionist, cosmetic chemist,

1923
02:13:35,580 --> 02:13:39,580
and founder of the Ocono Comp Pharmacy and Rocky

1924
02:13:39,580 --> 02:13:43,580
Mountain Natural Laboratories. He's very successful pharmacist Ben.com

1925
02:13:43,580 --> 02:13:47,580
BrightSideBen.com. And I'll just recap this if you just joined us. I'm

1926
02:13:47,580 --> 02:13:51,580
driving in Tuesday morning. And I get ready at home. So it's

1927
02:13:51,580 --> 02:13:55,580
about 10 o'clock I leave. It's about 10.30 to get to the office.

1928
02:13:55,580 --> 02:13:59,580
I got to get in and do the show. I couldn't. I had to keep listening because he was covering what

1929
02:13:59,580 --> 02:14:03,580
serotonin reuptake inhibitors do to the brain. What SRIs do.

1930
02:14:03,580 --> 02:14:07,580
Serotonin, you know, just the basic systems.

1931
02:14:07,580 --> 02:14:11,580
He was breaking it down. And so I called him. I had Richard call him and I said,

1932
02:14:11,580 --> 02:14:15,580
I want to get you on about what you were breaking down because I've had all these brain surgeons and scientists on.

1933
02:14:15,580 --> 02:14:19,580
They said the same thing. You say it's so concise. Send me the documentation

1934
02:14:19,580 --> 02:14:23,580
on that. I mean, I already know it, but send it to me. So he sent me this giant stack

1935
02:14:23,580 --> 02:14:27,580
of inserts and documents and even mainstream news about

1936
02:14:27,580 --> 02:14:31,580
placebos doing better than Prozac for you. And then many natural things

1937
02:14:31,580 --> 02:14:35,580
really helping people that are depressed. So this is about

1938
02:14:35,580 --> 02:14:39,580
solutions. And this is how people can safely from the research

1939
02:14:39,580 --> 02:14:43,580
get off serotonin reuptake inhibitors and the natural things out there the FDA

1940
02:14:43,580 --> 02:14:47,580
is trying to block you from getting. Then I'm going to ask him about things that help with allergies.

1941
02:14:47,580 --> 02:14:51,580
But again, I also have this report and I'll show TV viewers a document

1942
02:14:51,580 --> 02:14:55,580
cam shot. Yahoo Finance, Alabama

1943
02:14:55,580 --> 02:14:59,580
International or AL International announces results

1944
02:14:59,580 --> 02:15:03,580
of Younggeviti clinical research studies performed by Clemson University

1945
02:15:03,580 --> 02:15:07,580
Institute of Nutraceutical Research. Unbelievable

1946
02:15:07,580 --> 02:15:11,580
findings and scientific double blind studies. And yes,

1947
02:15:11,580 --> 02:15:15,580
we'll also do some pitching here to fund the operation. It's a win win. I promote

1948
02:15:15,580 --> 02:15:19,580
what I believe in. I like government that takes your money at gunpoint that uses it against you and gives it

1949
02:15:19,580 --> 02:15:23,580
MSNBC or state run media out of Qatar coming in and

1950
02:15:23,580 --> 02:15:27,580
buying Al Gore's network to brainwash us. We're here saying, hey,

1951
02:15:27,580 --> 02:15:31,580
we believe in this. These products are incredible. Infowarshealth.com and he's going to go through

1952
02:15:31,580 --> 02:15:35,580
many of the things he formulated available at Infowarshealth.com that

1953
02:15:35,580 --> 02:15:39,580
have had unbelievable responses out there. Okay, so we're going to go over this

1954
02:15:39,580 --> 02:15:43,580
also talk about what he would do for, say, cedar allergy or really mountain

1955
02:15:43,580 --> 02:15:47,580
juniper, but they call it cedar allergy. I'm going to pick his brain about that.

1956
02:15:47,580 --> 02:15:51,580
And again, Ben joins us and I've got some of the questions. I said, send me

1957
02:15:51,580 --> 02:15:55,580
questions that I should ask so I can understand this better and for people. So let's

1958
02:15:55,580 --> 02:15:59,580
talk about the shootings. Let's talk about what SSRIs are doing

1959
02:15:59,580 --> 02:16:03,580
and other psychotropics and antipsychotics that roughly 20% of the country is on.

1960
02:16:03,580 --> 02:16:07,580
And then let's talk about, from his research, what has successfully

1961
02:16:07,580 --> 02:16:11,580
helped people get off these and actually helped people not be depressed

1962
02:16:11,580 --> 02:16:15,580
in this Orwellian system. What the FDA doesn't want you to know about.

1963
02:16:15,580 --> 02:16:19,580
Okay, so pharmacist Ben joins us right now. Thank you

1964
02:16:19,580 --> 02:16:23,580
for coming on. Thank you for having me, Alex. It's a pleasure. Okay, we're going to break

1965
02:16:23,580 --> 02:16:27,580
in about four minutes, so start getting into these chemicals, what they're doing, the inserts

1966
02:16:27,580 --> 02:16:31,580
say they make you mass murder. Why? The answer is give big pharma

1967
02:16:31,580 --> 02:16:35,580
more money, more access to kids to stop mass shootings always connected to these

1968
02:16:35,580 --> 02:16:39,580
drugs. Well, the most important thing, Alex, for people to recognize is that far

1969
02:16:39,580 --> 02:16:43,580
from the happy, bliss-inducing, joy-inducing neurotransmitter

1970
02:16:43,580 --> 02:16:47,580
hormone substance that serotonin is portrayed to be by the mainstream

1971
02:16:47,580 --> 02:16:51,580
media and by mainstream medical professionals, it turns out that serotonin

1972
02:16:51,580 --> 02:16:55,580
is a hormone of vigilance. It's a hormone of awareness. It's a hormone

1973
02:16:55,580 --> 02:16:59,580
that's designed to keep us on our toes, so to speak. It's a daytime

1974
02:16:59,580 --> 02:17:03,580
hormone that's designed to keep us able to handle the ups and downs and the

1975
02:17:03,580 --> 02:17:07,580
vicissitudes of day-to-day life. So when you start to monkey around with

1976
02:17:07,580 --> 02:17:11,580
this serotonin system, what you're monkeying around with is the awareness

1977
02:17:11,580 --> 02:17:15,580
system, and the end result of too much serotonin is hyper-awareness,

1978
02:17:15,580 --> 02:17:19,580
hyper-vigilance, paranoia, and this sense that

1979
02:17:19,580 --> 02:17:23,580
this hyper-focused sense that people have when they're freaking out.

1980
02:17:23,580 --> 02:17:27,580
Artificial schizophrenia. It's like a type of schizophrenia. In fact,

1981
02:17:27,580 --> 02:17:31,580
LSD is very similar to serotonin. It's in the same

1982
02:17:31,580 --> 02:17:35,580
class. Same class, basically the same substance. Basically,

1983
02:17:35,580 --> 02:17:39,580
it's the same molecule, and if you want to know what the effects of

1984
02:17:39,580 --> 02:17:43,580
too much serotonin are, the kind of effects that you get when you start to manipulate the serotonin

1985
02:17:43,580 --> 02:17:47,580
clearing system, which is how these SSRI drugs are,

1986
02:17:47,580 --> 02:17:51,580
think of the last time you saw somebody on some kind of LSD trip.

1987
02:17:51,580 --> 02:17:55,580
LSD was actually researched, was discovered when they were

1988
02:17:55,580 --> 02:17:59,580
researching ways to manipulate this serotonin system. So

1989
02:17:59,580 --> 02:18:03,580
serotonin is a neurotransmitter

1990
02:18:03,580 --> 02:18:07,580
that is involved with the vigilance response. Now, you obviously need to have this

1991
02:18:07,580 --> 02:18:11,580
vigilance response, but you've got to be very, very careful with it. In addition,

1992
02:18:11,580 --> 02:18:15,580
serotonin is largely produced by stress

1993
02:18:15,580 --> 02:18:19,580
cells in the digestive system. Your digestive system is always

1994
02:18:19,580 --> 02:18:23,580
on the alert for poisons and for toxins, and you have these stress cells,

1995
02:18:23,580 --> 02:18:27,580
cells that are literally similar to adrenal cells, that produce

1996
02:18:27,580 --> 02:18:31,580
serotonin, just waiting for you to eat some kind of poison or some kind of toxin.

1997
02:18:31,580 --> 02:18:35,580
Is that why Prozac is linked to diabetes? Prozac is linked

1998
02:18:35,580 --> 02:18:39,580
to diabetes for other reasons. We can get into that in a moment. That's

1999
02:18:39,580 --> 02:18:43,580
a very important point, but that's why Prozac is used as an appetite

2000
02:18:43,580 --> 02:18:47,580
medicine. Prozac and serotonin has an effect on the digestive system

2001
02:18:47,580 --> 02:18:51,580
that is much bigger than the effect that it has on the brain. In fact, 90%

2002
02:18:51,580 --> 02:18:55,580
plus of the serotonin in your body is actually produced by these stress cells

2003
02:18:55,580 --> 02:18:59,580
in the digestive system. So this feeling of butterflies in your stomach,

2004
02:18:59,580 --> 02:19:03,580
the feeling of nervousness that you have before you have a date or if you have stage fright,

2005
02:19:03,580 --> 02:19:07,580
these are all serotonin mediated. They are the alert response

2006
02:19:07,580 --> 02:19:11,580
that's produced by serotonin in these digestive stress cells.

2007
02:19:11,580 --> 02:19:15,580
In the brain, serotonin is involved in the wakefulness

2008
02:19:15,580 --> 02:19:19,580
response, and if you want to know what serotonin really does, think about melatonin,

2009
02:19:19,580 --> 02:19:23,580
which is the exact opposite of serotonin, and we all know that when you take

2010
02:19:23,580 --> 02:19:27,580
melatonin, you feel groggy, you feel sleepy, you feel relaxed. Well, serotonin does

2011
02:19:27,580 --> 02:19:31,580
the exact opposite. Melatonin is the antagonistic.

2012
02:19:31,580 --> 02:19:35,580
Alright, we've got to go to break, but from my research, because you're the big pharmacist and the expert,

2013
02:19:35,580 --> 02:19:39,580
other experts have told me, after you've been on these drugs a while, though, it burns you out,

2014
02:19:39,580 --> 02:19:43,580
and they put you usually on more, then you're in a hyper awake form

2015
02:19:43,580 --> 02:19:47,580
of sleep. You're in a dream state or daydreaming state,

2016
02:19:47,580 --> 02:19:51,580
but hyper awake, having a hallucination, and that's why people then go and use

2017
02:19:51,580 --> 02:19:55,580
a meat cleaver to chop up their one year old baby and drink the blood when the woman

2018
02:19:55,580 --> 02:20:23,580
is a Sunday schoolteacher. We'll be right back. Stay with us.

2022
02:20:37,580 --> 02:20:41,580
tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.

2023
02:20:41,580 --> 02:20:45,580
You are the response to the globalist technocrats and

2024
02:20:45,580 --> 02:20:49,580
their program of global eugenics dehumanization and

2025
02:20:49,580 --> 02:20:53,580
ultimate extermination. The war is here. It's an info

2026
02:20:53,580 --> 02:20:57,580
war. The spirit of 1776

2027
02:20:57,580 --> 02:21:01,580
versus the mindset of 1984.

And it's just incredible I forgot to tell you the Communist Party USA

2072
02:33:29,580 --> 02:33:33,580
who I've caught on video in New York some of their

2073
02:33:33,580 --> 02:33:37,580
reported members that's in my film Martial Law

2074
02:33:37,580 --> 02:33:41,580
just saying get out of here. And they went on to say you know we're going to

2075
02:33:41,580 --> 02:33:45,580
kill you like Stalin did and I've told this story and it's no exaggeration

2076
02:33:45,580 --> 02:33:49,580
let me just be conservative. 20 times I can remember or more.

2077
02:33:49,580 --> 02:33:53,580
I've had communists come up and tell me that when they take over I'm dead. I mean their religion

2078
02:33:53,580 --> 02:33:57,580
is how they're going to kill us. And so again that's

2079
02:33:57,580 --> 02:34:01,580
also at NewAmerican.com but up at drugsreport.com

2080
02:34:01,580 --> 02:34:05,580
communists cheer on Obama's gun grab

2081
02:34:05,580 --> 02:34:09,580
and there it is right there and we syndicate some of their

2082
02:34:09,580 --> 02:34:13,580
better reports and even had Bob Dacy one of their writers in studio last week

2083
02:34:13,580 --> 02:34:17,580
a fellow Austinite and it's got links to all of it

2084
02:34:17,580 --> 02:34:21,580
and to the official peoplesworld.org saying take our guns

2085
02:34:21,580 --> 02:34:25,580
Unbelievable information up at drugsreport.com

2086
02:34:25,580 --> 02:34:29,580
easiest place to find it because I think this is already scrolled off our featured news

2087
02:34:29,580 --> 02:34:33,580
from this morning. Which is a problem with Infowars. It's not a problem but

2088
02:34:33,580 --> 02:34:37,580
we're going to redesign Prison Planet as a test with a big official company

2089
02:34:37,580 --> 02:34:41,580
and then redesign some things and if that works then we're going to go to Infowars with a redesign

2090
02:34:41,580 --> 02:34:45,580
still the basic look that's popular. But if you go to the top of Infowars.com which we can punch you up

2091
02:34:45,580 --> 02:34:49,580
you'll see two links here. Breaking News that's the total

2092
02:34:49,580 --> 02:34:53,580
RSS news feed and I think I'm going to change that red link to the

2093
02:34:53,580 --> 02:34:57,580
top stories because the stories we write are the stuff that we think is most important

2094
02:34:57,580 --> 02:35:01,580
probably twenty or thirty of them a day depending on how many we put out go in this

2095
02:35:01,580 --> 02:35:05,580
and every five or six hours on average the top six or seven stories scroll

2096
02:35:05,580 --> 02:35:09,580
through

2097
02:35:09,580 --> 02:35:13,580
well I just noticed that the top story area

2098
02:35:13,580 --> 02:35:17,580
or he must have just written a new article about that

2099
02:35:17,580 --> 02:35:21,580

standing up all over this great land from the north to the south to the east to the west

2115
02:36:21,580 --> 02:36:25,580
they're trying to say owning guns is a southern thing and trying to play us off against each other

2116
02:36:25,580 --> 02:36:29,580
New Yorkers and everybody else are coming together and saying how dare you bash people

2117
02:36:29,580 --> 02:36:33,580
in the south, we're all Americans, we're not hyphenated like you want us to be

2118
02:36:33,580 --> 02:36:37,580
we're not going to have a race war like you want, you're not getting our guns and I've seen so many

2119
02:36:37,580 --> 02:36:41,580
black folks and veterans mainly all over YouTube, I'm not even looking for it

2120
02:36:41,580 --> 02:36:45,580
I see like 20 really strong

2121
02:36:45,580 --> 02:36:49,580
smart, super well spoken, ought to have a radio show, black guys

2122
02:36:49,580 --> 02:36:53,580
just all over YouTube going on, we're not socialists, we're not globalists

2123
02:36:53,580 --> 02:36:57,580
we're not turning our guns in, we know what's going on, we know what's happening

2124
02:36:57,580 --> 02:37:01,580
we know the fraud, we know about eugenics, I mean it's exciting

2125
02:37:01,580 --> 02:37:05,580
it's exciting, okay I'm going to shut up and go back to our guest, Ben Fuchs

2126
02:37:05,580 --> 02:37:09,580
I'm glad Drudge linked to that because I saw that article this morning, I wanted to talk about it

2127
02:37:09,580 --> 02:37:13,580
look at all these stacks, I mean there's hundreds of articles, it's all insane

2128
02:37:13,580 --> 02:37:17,580
I'm going to cover a lot of special stuff tonight on the nightly news, we've got the reporters doing the news

2129
02:37:17,580 --> 02:37:21,580
but I'm going to have a special report on a couple things, Ben Fuchs

2130
02:37:21,580 --> 02:37:25,580
like this is your radio show now because I'm actually going to turn off my microphone and walk out of the room

2131
02:37:25,580 --> 02:37:29,580
because this gets me so angry and so excited that I'll start cutting into you

2132
02:37:29,580 --> 02:37:33,580
in the rest of this segment, get into the tryptophan

2133
02:37:33,580 --> 02:37:37,580
and the fact that they don't, you know what's in meat, they don't want us

2134
02:37:37,580 --> 02:37:41,580
getting that, explain to somebody on Prozac, I know you're not their doctor or pharmacist

2135
02:37:41,580 --> 02:37:45,580
but what you would do personally, I say Prozac, the whole class of dozens

2136
02:37:45,580 --> 02:37:49,580
of what is it 30 or 40 of these on the market or more right now, some numbers are over

2137
02:37:49,580 --> 02:37:53,580
70 but they're not quite in the same class, well you're the pharmacist, break down

2138
02:37:53,580 --> 02:37:57,580
what's not in our body, how they know this, why it says on the insert

2139
02:37:57,580 --> 02:38:01,580
could make you cause mass murder, have schizophrenic

2140
02:38:01,580 --> 02:38:05,580
mania, I've known women on it in college that were

2141
02:38:05,580 --> 02:38:09,580
every woman I knew on it was a nymphomaniac, I don't want to get into details here but I didn't like

2142
02:38:09,580 --> 02:38:13,580
that, I want the real woman, I want the real personality, not like some biological

2143
02:38:13,580 --> 02:38:17,580
android, what's, why does this, obviously they want more crazy

2144
02:38:17,580 --> 02:38:21,580
people so they want to put you on something that makes you crazy, what are things out there

2145
02:38:21,580 --> 02:38:25,580
naturally that would actually help people because of the deficiencies in this

2146
02:38:25,580 --> 02:38:29,580
toxic system, you have the floor, break it down. Well there's so many things, there's so

2147
02:38:29,580 --> 02:38:33,580
many ways and we'll talk about that in a second but I want people on SSRIs to understand this

2148
02:38:33,580 --> 02:38:37,580
the chemical imbalance theory of depression, the idea

2149
02:38:37,580 --> 02:38:41,580
that depression is caused by a lack of serotonin and that you build your

2150
02:38:41,580 --> 02:38:45,580
serotonin, you're not depressed, number one it's simplistic and naive and number two it's

2151
02:38:45,580 --> 02:38:49,580
never been shown to be the case, in fact drugs

2152
02:38:49,580 --> 02:38:53,580
that block serotonin have been shown to have anti-depressant activity just

2153
02:38:53,580 --> 02:38:57,580
as well as drugs that increase serotonin so please do not be fooled

2154
02:38:57,580 --> 02:39:01,580
by the simplistic idea that all you do is raise your serotonin levels

2155
02:39:01,580 --> 02:39:05,580
and you're not depressed anymore, that is drug company propaganda

2156
02:39:05,580 --> 02:39:09,580
that is marketing and advertising information that has never been

2157
02:39:09,580 --> 02:39:13,580
shown to be the case, that's first of all, what has been shown to

2158
02:39:13,580 --> 02:39:17,580
be the case is that elevations in serotonin, super high levels of serotonin

2159
02:39:17,580 --> 02:39:21,580
such as the kind that are caused by artificially manipulating

2160
02:39:21,580 --> 02:39:25,580
the serotonin system are associated with agitation, with restlessness

2161
02:39:25,580 --> 02:39:29,580
with diarrhea, with hallucinations, with fast heartbeat

2162
02:39:29,580 --> 02:39:33,580
serotonin itself, the very word serotonin

2163
02:39:33,580 --> 02:39:37,580
means sero for blood, tonin for tightening

2164
02:39:37,580 --> 02:39:41,580
that's because serotonin's classic effect is blood clotting

2165
02:39:41,580 --> 02:39:45,580
and hypertension, let me say that again, serotonin's classic

2166
02:39:45,580 --> 02:39:49,580
effect on the body is blood clotting and hypertension and it's in the

2167
02:39:49,580 --> 02:39:53,580
very name serotonin, now blood clotting and hypertension are two

2168
02:39:53,580 --> 02:39:57,580
iconic signs of the body's stress response

2169
02:39:57,580 --> 02:40:01,580
and given the fact that 80 million or more Americans are hypertensive

2170
02:40:01,580 --> 02:40:05,580
and some of the best selling drugs on the planet are blood thinning

2171
02:40:05,580 --> 02:40:09,580
drugs and among the most toxic drugs, so clearly blood clotting and hypertension

2172
02:40:09,580 --> 02:40:13,580
are big problems in this country, it seems to me that anybody who's considering

2173
02:40:13,580 --> 02:40:17,580
taking a drug that would manipulate serotonin levels, that would up

2174
02:40:17,580 --> 02:40:21,580
serotonin levels, that would increase the amount of this neurotransmitter

2175
02:40:21,580 --> 02:40:25,580
that's associated with blood clotting and hypertension would want to think twice

2176
02:40:25,580 --> 02:40:29,580
especially considering that this chemical imbalance theory has never been shown

2177
02:40:29,580 --> 02:40:33,580
to be the case, now what we do know is that serotonin is a hormone of

2178
02:40:33,580 --> 02:40:37,580
awareness, it's a hormone of vigilance, it is a summertime hormone

2179
02:40:37,580 --> 02:40:41,580
it is a daytime hormone, it is associated with

2180
02:40:41,580 --> 02:40:45,580
the sun and it's associated with light, which is why the best way to get

2181
02:40:45,580 --> 02:40:49,580
your serotonin is to make sure you're getting some sunlight and not only that

2182
02:40:49,580 --> 02:40:53,580
take your sunglasses off and make sure you're looking at the sun

2183
02:40:53,580 --> 02:40:57,580
the rays from the sun, the photonic energy from the sun will go through

2184
02:40:57,580 --> 02:41:01,580
your eyes, it'll go into your brain and it will help up-regulate

2185
02:41:01,580 --> 02:41:05,580
serotonin production, in addition Alex as you mentioned there's wonderful

2186
02:41:05,580 --> 02:41:09,580
wonderful nutritional strategies that you can use to up-regulate your

2187
02:41:09,580 --> 02:41:13,580
serotonin system, earlier we talked about how digestive

2188
02:41:13,580 --> 02:41:17,580
stress cells are called interochromatin cells, they're the largest

2189
02:41:17,580 --> 02:41:21,580
producers of serotonin in the body, one of the best ways that you can

2190
02:41:21,580 --> 02:41:25,580
make sure that your serotonin system is running cleanly is to eliminate

2191
02:41:25,580 --> 02:41:29,580
problem foods number one, and that means any kind of foods that the body will perceive

2192
02:41:29,580 --> 02:41:33,580
as a toxin, that is processed foods, that is things like excitotoxins

2193
02:41:33,580 --> 02:41:37,580
MSG for example, artificial flavors, and secondly

2194
02:41:37,580 --> 02:41:41,580
make sure you're addressing something called H. pylori

2195
02:41:41,580 --> 02:41:45,580
H. pylori is a bacteria that overgrows in the digestive tract

2196
02:41:45,580 --> 02:41:49,580
as we get older and as our digestive system becomes more compromised

2197
02:41:49,580 --> 02:41:53,580
as our acid production in our digestive system and our stomach starts to become compromised

2198
02:41:53,580 --> 02:41:57,580
this bacteria overgrows and that is a big time stressor on

2199
02:41:57,580 --> 02:42:01,580
the serotonin system, the digestive serotonin system, so addressing

2200
02:42:01,580 --> 02:42:05,580
your digestive system by clearing out H. pylori using things like apple cider

2201
02:42:05,580 --> 02:42:09,580
vinegar for example, digestive enzymes for example, probiotics

2202
02:42:09,580 --> 02:42:13,580
unbelievably important for supporting digestive health and supporting

2203
02:42:13,580 --> 02:42:17,580
the serotonin, the digestive serotonin system, then there's the supplements

2204
02:42:17,580 --> 02:42:21,580
that you could take, you mentioned 5-HTP and tryptophan, well

2205
02:42:21,580 --> 02:42:25,580
in order to understand the importance of tryptophan and 5-HTP when it comes

2206
02:42:25,580 --> 02:42:29,580
to serotonin, we have to understand a little bit about how biochemistry works

2207
02:42:29,580 --> 02:42:33,580
in the body, the body is always taking chemical A, turning it into chemical B

2208
02:42:33,580 --> 02:42:37,580
turning it into chemical C, turning it into chemical D, sort of like tinker toys

2209
02:42:37,580 --> 02:42:41,580
imagine when you were a kid you used to play with tinker toys, you stick a little piece in the tinker toy

2210
02:42:41,580 --> 02:42:45,580
and you create some kind of little constructive piece and then you put another

2211
02:42:45,580 --> 02:42:49,580
piece on and it's a different constructive unit that you've created

2212
02:42:49,580 --> 02:42:53,580
you put another piece on and you've created a different constructive unit and this is how chemicals

2213
02:42:53,580 --> 02:42:57,580
work in the body, well serotonin starts

2214
02:42:57,580 --> 02:43:01,580
off with tryptophan, tryptophan gets one piece stuck on and it becomes

2215
02:43:01,580 --> 02:43:05,580
5-HTP or 5-hydroxytryptophan, you stick

2216
02:43:05,580 --> 02:43:09,580
another piece on it and it becomes serotonin, but it all starts

2217
02:43:09,580 --> 02:43:13,580
from tryptophan, so you say well gosh tryptophan must be important stuff and you better

2218
02:43:13,580 --> 02:43:17,580
believe it's important stuff, not only is tryptophan critical for

2219
02:43:17,580 --> 02:43:21,580
making serotonin, but tryptophan is an essential

2220
02:43:21,580 --> 02:43:25,580
amino acid which means it must come in from the diet, you have

2221
02:43:25,580 --> 02:43:29,580
to be eating tryptophan and tryptophan is found exclusively

2222
02:43:29,580 --> 02:43:33,580
in high protein foods, you could find a little bit perhaps

2223
02:43:33,580 --> 02:43:37,580
in broccoli and asparagus and you'll find some in soy, but most

2224
02:43:37,580 --> 02:43:41,580
especially it's found in dairy and it's found in meat and it's especially

2225
02:43:41,580 --> 02:43:45,580
found in high concentrations in whey protein, in fact for anybody who's dealing

2226
02:43:45,580 --> 02:43:49,580
with SSRIs or wants to get off of SSRIs

2227
02:43:49,580 --> 02:43:53,580
the first thing you want to think about is getting yourself on some good whey

2228
02:43:53,580 --> 02:43:57,580
protein, a good whey protein supplement, if you can't handle it from a digestive standpoint

2229
02:43:57,580 --> 02:44:01,580
make sure you take it with digestive enzymes and a little bit of apple cider vinegar

2230
02:44:01,580 --> 02:44:05,580
just briefly tell us about that new product, tryptophan will boost your serotonin levels

2231
02:44:05,580 --> 02:44:09,580
but there's another way that you can boost your serotonin levels and that's by taking the

2232
02:44:09,580 --> 02:44:13,580
direct precursor to serotonin which is this stuff 5-HTP

2233
02:44:13,580 --> 02:44:17,580
now 5-HTP is unbelievably important and helpful

2234
02:44:17,580 --> 02:44:21,580
for people who are dealing with depression, anxiety, it's a wonderful sleep aid

2235
02:44:21,580 --> 02:44:25,580
it's a wonderful anti-apatite or appetite suppressant, it'll help you

2236
02:44:25,580 --> 02:44:29,580
lose weight, it's crazy cheap, it's like 10 or 15 bucks

2237
02:44:29,580 --> 02:44:33,580
for a 3 month supply, you take about 100 milligrams or 200

2238
02:44:33,580 --> 02:44:37,580
milligrams a night and that too will boost your serotonin, now when it comes to

2239
02:44:37,580 --> 02:44:41,580
making serotonin in the brain, it's not just protein, even though serotonin

2240
02:44:41,580 --> 02:44:45,580
comes from tryptophan, it's not just protein foods that help you

2241
02:44:45,580 --> 02:44:49,580
build serotonin, you actually have to have carbohydrate

2242
02:44:49,580 --> 02:44:53,580
with your protein, so you want to make sure that you're getting carbohydrates but you

2243
02:44:53,580 --> 02:44:57,580
want to make sure it's not super fast burning carbohydrates like

2244
02:44:57,580 --> 02:45:01,580
processed foods and soda pop and desserts, you want to make sure it's a carbohydrate that's got a lot of

2245
02:45:01,580 --> 02:45:05,580
fiber in it, especially vegetable carbohydrates, there's a big big

2246
02:45:05,580 --> 02:45:09,580
problem and there's an important relationship between sugar intake and serotonin

2247
02:45:09,580 --> 02:45:13,580
when you eat sugar, this is perceived biochemically by the body

2248
02:45:13,580 --> 02:45:17,580
as a major stress, sugar is very very explosive stuff

2249
02:45:17,580 --> 02:45:21,580
if you ever put a marshmallow in a fire and you see the marshmallow go poof

2250
02:45:21,580 --> 02:45:25,580
you can see how explosive sugar is, well in the body that same kind of

2251
02:45:25,580 --> 02:45:29,580
explosivity, that same kind of explosive reaction occurs

2252
02:45:29,580 --> 02:45:33,580
and so when you eat sugar, especially fast burning sugars, dessert kinds of

2253
02:45:33,580 --> 02:45:37,580
sugars, soda pop kinds of sugars, the body's stress response

2254
02:45:37,580 --> 02:45:41,580
is triggered and this stress response involves serotonin

2255
02:45:41,580 --> 02:45:45,580
in fact the hormone insulin and the hormone serotonin work

2256
02:45:45,580 --> 02:45:49,580
hand in hand and today we have a big problem, maybe the biggest

2257
02:45:49,580 --> 02:45:53,580
health crisis of all is something called insulin resistance and this is

2258
02:45:53,580 --> 02:45:57,580
when the body stops listening to insulin and going hand in hand with

2259
02:45:57,580 --> 02:46:01,580
insulin resistance is serotonin resistance and just like insulin

2260
02:46:01,580 --> 02:46:05,580
resistance will keep the body from listening to insulin, serotonin resistance will keep the

2261
02:46:05,580 --> 02:46:09,580
body from listening to serotonin, of course then you're going to go to the doctor and he's going to give you

2262
02:46:09,580 --> 02:46:13,580
an SSRI drug and all you really need to do is

2263
02:46:13,580 --> 02:46:17,580
reset this insulin system by reducing your intake of fast burning sugars

2264
02:46:17,580 --> 02:46:21,580
so you want to make sure you're having some carbohydrate with your protein, you want to make sure it's

2265
02:46:21,580 --> 02:46:25,580
fibery carbohydrate, you want to make sure you're getting enough protein, especially tryptophan

2266
02:46:25,580 --> 02:46:29,580
containing protein and you want to make sure that you're getting 5 HTP, now in addition

2267
02:46:29,580 --> 02:46:33,580
to all of this, there are co-factors that the brain uses, the body

2268
02:46:33,580 --> 02:46:37,580
uses to help make serotonin, chief among these is vitamin

2269
02:46:37,580 --> 02:46:41,580
C and the B complex, especially vitamin B6 and to a little bit

2270
02:46:41,580 --> 02:46:45,580
lesser extent minerals like zinc and magnesium, and that's why you need to take the Beyond Tangy Tangerine

2271
02:46:45,580 --> 02:46:49,580
and infowarshealth.com, I mean it's simple, my children act like demons

2272
02:46:49,580 --> 02:46:53,580
and I let them have processed sugar but when we are on the job and only feed them organic

2273
02:46:53,580 --> 02:46:57,580
and healthy food, they're little angels and everything's great, if I'm on the road

2274
02:46:57,580 --> 02:47:01,580
and I'm dumb enough to eat a piece of cake or something, I feel like I have a hangover the next day

2275
02:47:01,580 --> 02:47:05,580
going over this and people go to infowarshealth.com, there's many of the products, you and

2276
02:47:05,580 --> 02:47:09,580
others and Dr. Wallach have formulated and this is no joke folks

2277
02:47:09,580 --> 02:47:13,580
what would you, again we're not giving them the advice, they should, because it's

2278
02:47:13,580 --> 02:47:17,580
very dangerous to go off the serotonin reuptake inhibitors and we have a report

2279
02:47:17,580 --> 02:47:21,580
here, we're going to show people in a moment, what would you do

2280
02:47:21,580 --> 02:47:25,580
if you were say a 35 year old man or woman who's been

2281
02:47:25,580 --> 02:47:29,580
on psychotropics for say 6 years, they've got you on 3 of them

2282
02:47:29,580 --> 02:47:33,580
because the others didn't work and you don't know

2283
02:47:33,580 --> 02:47:37,580
who you are anymore and you're kind of eating a regular McDonald's

2284
02:47:37,580 --> 02:47:41,580
diet, what would be just the brief process that Ben Fuchs, and again my dad's

2285
02:47:41,580 --> 02:47:45,580
a dentist and oral surgeon, the people he respects more than anybody aren't

2286
02:47:45,580 --> 02:47:49,580
even doctors of people, it's pharmacists because he knows especially long time

2287
02:47:49,580 --> 02:47:53,580
master pharmacist, you guys kill people if you make a mistake and so

2288
02:47:53,580 --> 02:47:57,580
you guys really went to school to actually know what the drugs do, you know

2289
02:47:57,580 --> 02:48:01,580
I don't know 20, 30 times what doctors do, so that's why you're the

2290
02:48:01,580 --> 02:48:05,580
guy to talk to on this, what are the dangers of going off the serotonin

2291
02:48:05,580 --> 02:48:09,580
reuptake inhibitors or other anti-psychotic classes?

2292
02:48:09,580 --> 02:48:13,580
Well first of all we have to understand how serotonin reuptake inhibitors work, when the brain

2293
02:48:13,580 --> 02:48:17,580
secretes serotonin it immediately sucks that serotonin back up again

2294
02:48:17,580 --> 02:48:21,580
so the serotonin will get released and then it will get uptaken

2295
02:48:21,580 --> 02:48:25,580
it will get sucked back up again into the

2296
02:48:25,580 --> 02:48:29,580
nerves so that it doesn't have too much of an effect, this is called reuptake and it's a

2297
02:48:29,580 --> 02:48:33,580
standard process that occurs in the body or in the brain

2298
02:48:33,580 --> 02:48:37,580
reuptake inhibitors inhibit that

2299
02:48:37,580 --> 02:48:41,580
process so the serotonin stays in the system

2300
02:48:41,580 --> 02:48:45,580
a major chemical imbalance, that serotonin is artificially

2301
02:48:45,580 --> 02:48:49,580
kept active, so you get off your serotonin reuptake inhibitors and because

2302
02:48:49,580 --> 02:48:53,580
this uptake mechanism has been shut down, now you've got all of this

2303
02:48:53,580 --> 02:48:57,580
serotonin that has left the nerve cells, you run into

2304
02:48:57,580 --> 02:49:01,580
a major, major risk of serotonin depletion because the serotonin

2305
02:49:01,580 --> 02:49:05,580
is not getting taken up back into the cell, so you want to make

2306
02:49:05,580 --> 02:49:09,580
sure if you're going to get off of serotonin reuptake inhibitors that you

2307
02:49:09,580 --> 02:49:13,580
wean yourself off of them very slowly and you build your

2308
02:49:13,580 --> 02:49:17,580
serotonin levels back up by number one, making sure you're getting out in

2309
02:49:17,580 --> 02:49:21,580
the sun, make sure you get 10 or 15 minutes of sun 3 or 4 days a week

2310
02:49:21,580 --> 02:49:25,580
you don't want to burn, but you want to make sure that you're getting some sun

2311
02:49:25,580 --> 02:49:29,580
yeah the ultimate prozac is climbing mountains, I'm telling you right now

2312
02:49:29,580 --> 02:49:33,580
absolutely, ultimate prozac is the great outdoors, nature and the divine force, that's the prozac

2313
02:49:33,580 --> 02:49:37,580
oh my god, I want more of it!

2314
02:49:37,580 --> 02:49:41,580
right, you get out in the sun, don't we all feel better when we're out in the sun?

2315
02:49:41,580 --> 02:49:45,580
are you kidding, if I had my way all I'd do is climb mountains

2316
02:49:45,580 --> 02:49:49,580
with a demon in the sky that's hell-bent on our destruction

2317
02:49:49,580 --> 02:49:53,580
we've been bamboozled and entranced and we believe this nonsense

2318
02:49:53,580 --> 02:49:57,580
and then as you point out, when we don't have the vitamins and minerals, we do get sunburned

2319
02:49:57,580 --> 02:50:01,580
well that's another thing, if you want to prevent yourself from getting sunburned, make sure you're getting nutrients

2320
02:50:01,580 --> 02:50:05,580
that get stored in your skin to protect you from the sun, carotenes, flavonoids

2321
02:50:05,580 --> 02:50:09,580
vitamin c, zinc, vitamin e, they literally get deposited in your skin

2322
02:50:09,580 --> 02:50:13,580
to protect you from the sun, and let me tell you something, skin cancer rates

2323
02:50:13,580 --> 02:50:17,580
are increasing dramatically, despite the fact that

2324
02:50:17,580 --> 02:50:21,580
how do you like that? the sun is actually protective against skin cancer

2325
02:50:21,580 --> 02:50:25,580
the sun is protective against skin cancer, and people are using sunscreens

2326
02:50:25,580 --> 02:50:29,580
like they're going out of style, and skin cancer rates are increasing by 100%

2327
02:50:29,580 --> 02:50:33,580
aluminum based, we're going to come back, I want to talk about

2328
02:50:33,580 --> 02:50:37,580
again, somebody on these drugs, because I've got a schedule here from

2329
02:50:37,580 --> 02:50:41,580
ssrstories.com, and it talks about warning, going off this

2330
02:50:41,580 --> 02:50:45,580
is a big deal, I mean folks, you're on a LSD molecule

2331
02:50:45,580 --> 02:50:49,580
so we're going to come back, and we're extremists

2332
02:50:49,580 --> 02:50:53,580
we're saying LSD is bad to give to kids, especially

2333
02:50:53,580 --> 02:50:57,580
they're going to have a bad trip, and almost all these shooters and mothers

2334
02:50:57,580 --> 02:51:21,580
that kill their kids, they're on it, why don't we send them to jail?

2335
02:51:27,580 --> 02:51:31,580
is only compounding the problem

2336
02:51:31,580 --> 02:51:35,580
dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids

2337
02:51:35,580 --> 02:51:39,580
a solar power generator provides

2338
02:51:39,580 --> 02:51:43,580

education

We don't need

2376
02:54:11,580 --> 02:54:15,580
no thought control

2377
02:54:15,580 --> 02:54:19,580
Again, ladies and gentlemen, I don't have a dairy, I don't sell milk

2378
02:54:19,580 --> 02:54:23,580
I don't sell eggs, I don't sell beef steak

2379
02:54:23,580 --> 02:54:27,580
There's a lot of contaminants in the beef and stuff now, as you know

2380
02:54:27,580 --> 02:54:31,580
There's some downsides to a bunch of meat, and even though I love every piece of it

2381
02:54:31,580 --> 02:54:35,580
Because of the industrial system, we've got high quality whey available

2382
02:54:35,580 --> 02:54:39,580
Obviously, so I guess we do sell that in the way at Infowarshealth.com

2383
02:54:39,580 --> 02:54:43,580

I'm using this myself, that's available, tastes great

2389
02:55:03,580 --> 02:55:07,580
Kids love it, they can put it in water and stir it up

2390
02:55:07,580 --> 02:55:11,580
Tastes just like root beer, well I guess it is root beer, without the sugar and stuff

For people, Catherine at Infowars.com

2400
02:55:47,580 --> 02:55:51,580
And we have a whole team there of people, some of them pharmacists and others, when they answer the phone

2401
02:55:51,580 --> 02:55:55,580
Others are just trained by them to answer your questions, Infowarshealth.com

2402
02:55:55,580 --> 02:55:59,580
This is a revolution though, because I'll tell you this, Beyond Tangy Tangerine

2403
02:55:59,580 --> 02:56:03,580
Polymers Plus, the essential fatty acids, all of it

2404
02:56:03,580 --> 02:56:07,580
What it's giving me is more energy

2405
02:56:07,580 --> 02:56:11,580
Something magic to give us energy, no, we're designed for the minerals

2406
02:56:11,580 --> 02:56:15,580
The trace elements, the things we need, the government says we need 40-something vitamins and minerals

2407
02:56:15,580 --> 02:56:19,580
We need 90, and it's all available at Infowarshealth.com

2408
02:56:19,580 --> 02:56:23,580
Okay, so continuing, basically you're saying get out in the sunshine

2409
02:56:23,580 --> 02:56:27,580
While you wean yourself off, there's different regimens online

2410
02:56:27,580 --> 02:56:31,580
Doctors say it takes about two months generally, depending on the type

2411
02:56:31,580 --> 02:56:35,580
Obviously consult one of the physicians, the problem is these psychologists aren't really physicians

2412
02:56:35,580 --> 02:56:39,580
They'll tell you, stay on it, or their answer is more of it, well this isn't working

2413
02:56:39,580 --> 02:56:43,580
We'll stack them, that'll fix it, so we're not telling you what to do

2414
02:56:43,580 --> 02:56:47,580
I'm saying get out, exercise fresh air

2415
02:56:47,580 --> 02:56:51,580
Pray to God, if you don't believe in that, meditate, all the studies show it works

2416
02:56:51,580 --> 02:56:55,580
For whatever reason, praying helps, there are no atheists and foxholes

2417
02:56:55,580 --> 02:56:59,580
Ben, why do the studies show, I've got them right here, that the

2418
02:56:59,580 --> 02:57:03,580
Praying helps? Well, relaxation response

2419
02:57:03,580 --> 02:57:07,580
That's the reason why people have religion in the first place, is this idea that there's something

2420
02:57:07,580 --> 02:57:11,580
That can help them, that can take control over their lives

2421
02:57:11,580 --> 02:57:15,580
I'm not a particular religious person, but I'm a very spiritual person, and there's a lot of

2422
02:57:15,580 --> 02:57:17,580
A lot of good that can be had by people

2423
02:57:17,580 --> 02:57:21,580
When you pray, what are you focusing on? The great void, the great unknown, the universe

2424
02:57:21,580 --> 02:57:23,580
You're forgetting all this, you're ah

2425
02:57:23,580 --> 02:57:27,580
The magic of the body, the amazingness of nature, the cosmos

2426
02:57:27,580 --> 02:57:31,580
There's a hundred trillion cells in your body, and each one of them has 18 feet

2427
02:57:31,580 --> 02:57:35,580
Of DNA, if you added all the DNA in your body, it would go 300 billion miles

2428
02:57:35,580 --> 02:57:39,580
You have a coordinated, tightly choreographed

2429
02:57:39,580 --> 02:57:43,580
System that is beyond belief, just in a tiny cell of which you have a hundred trillion

2430
02:57:43,580 --> 02:57:47,580
It's unbelievable, Alex, we are the most unbelievable

2431
02:57:47,580 --> 02:57:51,580
We're the most unbelievable creatures, we should be only focusing on that

2432
02:57:51,580 --> 02:57:55,580
Let alone the cosmos that is trillions upon trillions

2433
02:57:55,580 --> 02:57:59,580
Look, one piece of human DNA as you know, three billion long

2434
02:57:59,580 --> 02:58:03,580
One piece, we are incredible

2435
02:58:03,580 --> 02:58:07,580
Incredible, Alex, you know what a cell is? A cell is a tiny, we talk about cells so glibly

2436
02:58:07,580 --> 02:58:11,580
But what is this thing? It's a tiny little animal that if you took it out of your body

2437
02:58:11,580 --> 02:58:15,580
And put it in a petri dish, it would walk to food, it would run away from poison

2438
02:58:15,580 --> 02:58:19,580
It excretes, it reproduces, it has a skeletal system, and it's one one hundredth

2439
02:58:19,580 --> 02:58:23,580
No, no, we're just like jellyfish, we are a colony creature

2440
02:58:23,580 --> 02:58:27,580
You know about that, don't you? The fact that our tissues make up a colony

2441
02:58:27,580 --> 02:58:31,580
We are a colony, that's right, we're a hundred trillion cell colony, that's exactly right

2442
02:58:31,580 --> 02:58:35,580
With DNA that resonates from signals from space

2443
02:58:35,580 --> 02:58:39,580
Proven, antennas, spiritual antennas, we'll be back

2444

2462
03:00:17,580 --> 03:00:21,580
And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones

2463
03:00:21,580 --> 03:00:25,580
I promise you this, unless I get run over by a car

2464
03:00:25,580 --> 03:00:29,580
The next couple of weeks we'll get Ben back to take an hour or two of calls

2465
03:00:29,580 --> 03:00:33,580
On allergies, on getting off serotonin reuptake inhibitors, on weight loss, everything

2466
03:00:33,580 --> 03:00:37,580
And again, we're doing a few minutes in for marshaling here, but really this is all hey, go eat more eggs

2467
03:00:37,580 --> 03:00:41,580
Folks, drink more milk, I mean healthy milk

2468
03:00:41,580 --> 03:00:45,580
It's really more sunlight

2469
03:00:45,580 --> 03:00:49,580
Now we do have SleepEase that does have the

2470
03:00:49,580 --> 03:00:53,580
Chemicals, the 5-HTP in it

2471
03:00:53,580 --> 03:00:57,580
That then I guess gets converted over to the tryptophan

2472
03:00:57,580 --> 03:01:01,580
And other things that the EPA took off the market with a fake scare a few decades ago

2473
03:01:01,580 --> 03:01:05,580
But the precursor of it, SleepEase, available at InfowarsHealth.com

2474
03:01:05,580 --> 03:01:09,580
Right now, there in the huge catalog

2475
03:01:09,580 --> 03:01:13,580
But Ben, you've agreed to stay another 20 minutes, what I'm going to do is we're going to come back in the next

2476
03:01:13,580 --> 03:01:17,580
Segment, I'm going to throw it to you to cover areas of this in general

2477
03:01:17,580 --> 03:01:21,580
Then I'm going to come back in the final segment, we're in overdrive right now

2478
03:01:21,580 --> 03:01:25,580
The reason I get so excited about all this is the truth is laying around all

2479
03:01:25,580 --> 03:01:29,580
In front of us, and it really makes me mad at the power structure, because you're a nice guy

2480
03:01:29,580 --> 03:01:33,580
You say, well, most doctors and people don't know this, and that's actually true, because I know a lot of

2481
03:01:33,580 --> 03:01:37,580
Doctors, my dad knows a lot of them, but a lot of them in the power

2482
03:01:37,580 --> 03:01:41,580
Structure, they do know, and it's very cold blooded that

2483
03:01:41,580 --> 03:01:45,580
Double blind studies, sugar pills, better than Prozac, and actually makes, I mean

2484
03:01:45,580 --> 03:01:49,580
What's happening in Harris and Kleibold and all these guys who are on these drugs

2485
03:01:49,580 --> 03:01:53,580
When they go crazy and have that same million mile stare, you know, crazy

2486
03:01:53,580 --> 03:01:57,580
Man look on their face, what's happening to them

2487
03:01:57,580 --> 03:02:01,580
When they're playing murder simulator video games and they're on four or five drugs

2488
03:02:01,580 --> 03:02:05,580
And an amphetamine drug on top of it usually, and they go and kill everybody

2489
03:02:05,580 --> 03:02:07,580
I mean, they're highly suggestible

2490
03:02:07,580 --> 03:02:11,580
Violence and paranoia are part of the hypervigilant response

2491
03:02:11,580 --> 03:02:15,580
Vigilance is important, you know, you've got to be aware, but this hypervigilant

2492
03:02:15,580 --> 03:02:19,580
Response is akin to paranoia, what we call paranoia can be defined as hypervigilance

2493
03:02:19,580 --> 03:02:23,580
When you start messing around with serotonin, pharmacologically manipulating

2494
03:02:23,580 --> 03:02:27,580
Its levels, keeping serotonin activity high artificially

2495
03:02:27,580 --> 03:02:31,580
You run the risk of this kind of paranoia hypervigilance, which is where

2496
03:02:31,580 --> 03:02:35,580
Rage comes from and rageful behavior comes from, you can't mess around

2497
03:02:35,580 --> 03:02:39,580
With your brain chemistry artificially and not expect to create

2498
03:02:39,580 --> 03:02:43,580
Problems, and this whole idea of chemical imbalance, manipulating the brain

2499
03:02:43,580 --> 03:02:47,580
Alex, do you think there's a test for serotonin, do you think you go to a psychiatrist and he

2500
03:02:47,580 --> 03:02:51,580
Does a test to see how high your serotonin level goes, they just give it to you

2501
03:02:51,580 --> 03:02:55,580
They just give them to you, that's exactly right, they give them to you like they're M&M's or like they're candy

2502
03:02:55,580 --> 03:02:59,580
The fact of the matter is the history of psychiatry is not very pretty, the history of medicine

2503
03:02:59,580 --> 03:03:03,580
In general is not very pretty, the inventor of the lobotomy as you know a hundred years ago did thousands

2504
03:03:03,580 --> 03:03:07,580
Thousands where he would go before a carnival and take a mentally

2505
03:03:07,580 --> 03:03:11,580
Retarded person and jam an ice pick in their brain in front of people

2506
03:03:11,580 --> 03:03:15,580
That's how they do, that's how they used to cure depression, they would hack your brain out

2507
03:03:15,580 --> 03:03:19,580
Or electroconvulsive therapy where they shock you into being happy, this is the

2508
03:03:19,580 --> 03:03:23,580
History of psychiatry, but Alex the question is, why are we complicit

2509
03:03:23,580 --> 03:03:27,580
Why do we participate, why do we listen to anything they tell us

2510
03:03:27,580 --> 03:03:31,580
When like you say, the information is right there in plain sight

2511
03:03:31,580 --> 03:03:35,580
Perhaps hidden in plain sight, but it's in plain sight, I sent you a stack of information

2512
03:03:35,580 --> 03:03:39,580
It took me all of 15 or 20 minutes to gather that information

2513
03:03:39,580 --> 03:03:43,580
It's everywhere, the fact of the matter is if you do your research you will see

2514
03:03:43,580 --> 03:03:47,580
Serotonin is a sunlight, daylight, awareness, vigilance, hormone

2515
03:03:47,580 --> 03:03:51,580
This is another very important point, serotonin absorbs

2516
03:03:51,580 --> 03:03:55,580
Light, serotonin contains, serotonin contains tryptophan

2517
03:03:55,580 --> 03:03:59,580
Or a tryptophan like shape, tryptophan itself contains like chlorophyll

2518
03:03:59,580 --> 03:04:03,580
Which is the ultimate light absorbing substance, gets its light absorbing power

2519
03:04:03,580 --> 03:04:07,580
From tryptophan, so when you eat tryptophan, not only do you upregulate

2520
03:04:07,580 --> 03:04:11,580
Serotonin, but you help your body utilize light, Alex we are

2521
03:04:11,580 --> 03:04:15,580
Photosynthetic beings, we absorb light from the sun

2522
03:04:15,580 --> 03:04:19,580
That sunlight gets turned into batteries, it gets turned into biochemistry

2523
03:04:19,580 --> 03:04:23,580
It gets turned into physical matter, most especially serotonin

2524
03:04:23,580 --> 03:04:27,580
In fact, by the way, tryptophan is a part of our visual pigment

2525
03:04:27,580 --> 03:04:31,580
We actually see via the activity of tryptophan, we receive light from the sun in our eyes

2526
03:04:31,580 --> 03:04:35,580
Via the activity of tryptophan, by the way I'm showing people images

2527
03:04:35,580 --> 03:04:39,580
Of public lobotomies, if you even misbehave

2528
03:04:39,580 --> 03:04:43,580
They just take you down and jam an ice pick up through the eyelid

2529
03:04:43,580 --> 03:04:47,580
And right into your brain, into the cerebral cortex and just randomly

2530
03:04:47,580 --> 03:04:51,580
Punching holes into your brain with pleasure

2531
03:04:51,580 --> 03:05:19,580
Come back and continue to break this down with pharmacist Ben Fuchs, InfowarsHealth.com

2532
03:05:21,580 --> 03:05:31,580
You will wake up people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level

2533
03:05:31,580 --> 03:05:35,580
We need your help to spread the word like never before

2534
03:05:35,580 --> 03:05:41,580
They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness

2535
03:05:41,580 --> 03:05:45,580
You are the response to the globalist technocrats

2536
03:05:45,580 --> 03:05:49,580
And their program of global eugenics dehumanization

2537
03:05:49,580 --> 03:05:55,580
Ultimate extermination, the war is here, it's an Infowar

2538
03:05:55,580 --> 03:06:01,580
The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984

2539
03:06:01,580 --> 03:06:05,580

LASIG e-cigarettes for today's modern smoker

2553
03:07:00,580 --> 03:07:06,580
Injuries, slow healing, aches and pains, constipation, weakness, fatigue are all common the older one gets

2554
03:07:06,580 --> 03:07:15,580
The progressive deterioration of the body that occurs almost universally the older one gets can partly to significantly be prevented with conscientious attention to nutrition

2555
03:07:15,580 --> 03:07:23,580
If the Hanza men can play rugby in their 90s then it is possible for everyone in North America to experience a more youthful life as well

2556
03:07:23,580 --> 03:07:28,580
One key ingredient to warding off aging and reversing some of it is the type and quality of protein consumed

2557
03:07:28,580 --> 03:07:37,580
All protein foods or supplements you currently consume are heat damaged destroying 50 to 75% of your ability to utilize the body building amino acids

2558
03:07:37,580 --> 03:07:43,580
One World Way is not heat damaged and allows your body to utilize 100% of the amino acids

2559
03:07:43,580 --> 03:07:46,580
This feat no one else has achieved

2560
03:07:46,580 --> 03:07:48,580

The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show

2565
03:08:06,580 --> 03:08:09,580
Because there's a war on for your mind

2566
03:08:09,580 --> 03:08:25,580
We're back live, pharmacist Ben Fuchs, compounding pharmacist is our guest

2567
03:08:25,580 --> 03:08:31,580
We're doing one more segment with him here on this Friday edition and I'll be back this Sunday

2568
03:08:31,580 --> 03:08:39,580
4 to 6 p.m. Central live in studio we ran a best of with some new stuff that had there but also some tidbits of best of last Sunday 4 to 6

2569
03:08:39,580 --> 03:08:43,580
About once a month it's a rebroadcast, about three times a month it's live

2570
03:08:43,580 --> 03:08:47,580
One of the hardest working guys in media because I know there's no future if we don't turn this around

2571
03:08:47,580 --> 03:08:51,580
I'm going to shoot a couple of reports that are going to be on the nightly news tonight of extreme import

2572
03:08:51,580 --> 03:08:57,580
And that's 7 o'clock central, prisonplanet.tv, you can get 11 memberships for $5.95 a month and share them

2573
03:08:57,580 --> 03:09:00,580
I mean nobody offers that, that just pays for the bandwidth

2574
03:09:00,580 --> 03:09:07,580
Our goal is to get the word out, we have the $115,000 contest we're able to do because you're supporting us

2575
03:09:07,580 --> 03:09:14,580
For people to make films, thousand films I guess will be made, it will reach I'd guess 50 to 100 million people

2576
03:09:14,580 --> 03:09:17,580
That's my goal is 100 million, I'd be happy with 50 million

2577
03:09:17,580 --> 03:09:24,580
There will be some great films made, great resistance to tyranny and the winner gets $100,000, second place $10,000

2578
03:09:24,580 --> 03:09:30,580
Operation of Paul Revere, third place $5,000 and then it shot that pool of not just the winners but others

2579
03:09:30,580 --> 03:09:35,580
To come here and be financed by infowars.com, producing it to make a flotilla of films

2580
03:09:35,580 --> 03:09:40,580
Because I could make some really good films and I have obviously mega viral films

2581
03:09:40,580 --> 03:09:45,580
But we want to go to the next level and just expand the team in the face of this, it's all in

2582
03:09:45,580 --> 03:09:50,580
It's a total commitment against the new world order and we couldn't have done it without your support

2583
03:09:50,580 --> 03:09:57,580
If you support us in a win win, buying pro pure water filters discounted with promo code water at infowarsstore.com

2584
03:09:57,580 --> 03:10:03,580
Or going to infowarshealth.com and getting the best supplements that we've assembled all in one spot via Younggebity

2585
03:10:03,580 --> 03:10:07,580
Discounted, infowarshealth.com, this is how we do it

2586
03:10:07,580 --> 03:10:15,580
And by the way I'm not being a bad guy here because I'm against Genesis, Genesis is great

2587
03:10:15,580 --> 03:10:19,580
Most radio networks and stations take any advertising, Genesis has a lot of standards

2588
03:10:19,580 --> 03:10:24,580
But I'm approached all the time by supplement companies and they'll say

2589
03:10:24,580 --> 03:10:29,580
We'll pay you $100,000 to endorse this product and I go see the claims and I can't prove it

2590
03:10:29,580 --> 03:10:35,580
And I go sorry I'm not going to do that and then they come back and go we'll pay you $500,000 right now

2591
03:10:35,580 --> 03:10:41,580
These are things you hear nationwide not just on Genesis and I go I'm sorry I just can't prove these things

2592
03:10:41,580 --> 03:10:49,580
And so no, I have to do money bombs or sell memberships or whatever but everything I do is about getting the word out

2593
03:10:49,580 --> 03:10:52,580
If it's a t-shirt it's about defending the second amendment or property rights

2594
03:10:52,580 --> 03:10:55,580
If it's a film it's about exposing agenda 21

2595
03:10:55,580 --> 03:10:59,580
Everything we do is a win win win win win and Infowarshealth is just amazing

2596
03:10:59,580 --> 03:11:04,580
So get your beyond tangy tangerine, your polymers plus that bears my name on it, I like it so much

2597
03:11:04,580 --> 03:11:10,580
All the different supplements are available there, the essential fatty acids, everything

2598
03:11:10,580 --> 03:11:13,580
Infowarshealth.com and know you're supporting us

2599
03:11:13,580 --> 03:11:19,580
Now Ben I'm going to give you the rest of this segment about 10 minutes to get into other facets

2600
03:11:19,580 --> 03:11:23,580
What you would do, why allergies are increasing, how people should detox

2601
03:11:23,580 --> 03:11:27,580
Other things about what Prozac and other drugs are doing to people

2602
03:11:27,580 --> 03:11:31,580
What you would do with a child who's obviously bouncing off the walls

2603
03:11:31,580 --> 03:11:34,580
It's usually they admit what they've been eating

2604
03:11:34,580 --> 03:11:37,580
You've got the floor for the balance of this segment

2605
03:11:37,580 --> 03:11:40,580
Alex there's two great movements in the body

2606
03:11:40,580 --> 03:11:44,580
You have the movement towards stress and vigilance and awareness and fear

2607
03:11:44,580 --> 03:11:47,580
And you have the relaxation response

2608
03:11:47,580 --> 03:11:54,580
Growth and repair and anti-aging and healing all occur when the body is relaxed

2609
03:11:54,580 --> 03:11:58,580
Anything that exacerbates or exaggerates the stress response

2610
03:11:58,580 --> 03:12:03,580
Serotonin for example, prescription drugs for example, sugar and processed food for example

2611
03:12:03,580 --> 03:12:09,580
Anything that exacerbates the stress response, this fear response is going to shut down growth and repair

2612
03:12:09,580 --> 03:12:14,580
And this is why it seems to me like there's this almost this insidious conspiracy

2613
03:12:14,580 --> 03:12:19,580
To keep us from being able to grow, to keep us sick, to keep us from being able to repair

2614
03:12:19,580 --> 03:12:24,580
To accelerate the aging process and this is why it's so, so, so important

2615
03:12:24,580 --> 03:12:28,580
To avoid interacting with prescription drugs at all times

2616
03:12:28,580 --> 03:12:31,580
With the exception perhaps of pain pills if you're in pain

2617
03:12:31,580 --> 03:12:36,580
Antibiotics obviously although these days we hear about the problems with antibiotic resistance

2618
03:12:36,580 --> 03:12:40,580
Anybody who understands anything about antibiotics could have seen this one coming

2619
03:12:40,580 --> 03:12:45,580
But still there's times when you need antibiotics perhaps aside from antibiotics and pain pills and perhaps chemotherapy

2620
03:12:45,580 --> 03:12:49,580
Any prescription drugs need to be avoided like the plague

2621
03:12:49,580 --> 03:12:51,580
Literally like the plague

2622
03:12:51,580 --> 03:12:56,580
If you're on an SSRI drug, if you're considering an SSRI drug please consider the alternatives

2623
03:12:56,580 --> 03:12:59,580
Number one, get yourself out in the sun

2624
03:12:59,580 --> 03:13:02,580
Number two, make sure you're practicing deep breathing techniques

2625
03:13:02,580 --> 03:13:06,580
Number three, make sure you're getting enough salt for your adrenal glands

2626
03:13:06,580 --> 03:13:09,580
This is another hideous idea that we have to avoid salt

2627
03:13:09,580 --> 03:13:14,580
The fact of the matter is salt is very important for helping the adrenal glands

2628
03:13:14,580 --> 03:13:18,580
And keeping your body from going into this fight or flight response

2629
03:13:18,580 --> 03:13:21,580
Make sure that you're using a nutritional supplement program

2630
03:13:21,580 --> 03:13:25,580
Especially the B complex which is not only important for making serotonin

2631
03:13:25,580 --> 03:13:29,580
But it's important for the stress response and it's important for mental health as well

2632
03:13:29,580 --> 03:13:33,580
Make sure you're focusing on digestive wellness

2633
03:13:33,580 --> 03:13:36,580
The immune system is the digestive system in many ways

2634
03:13:36,580 --> 03:13:41,580
In fact 80-90% of your immune system is located in the digestive tract

2635
03:13:41,580 --> 03:13:44,580
You talk about allergies, the number one cause of allergies

2636
03:13:44,580 --> 03:13:49,580
Whether it's to cedarwood or whether it's to juniper or whether it's to pollen or whether it's to anything else

2637
03:13:49,580 --> 03:13:52,580
The number one cause is a stressed out immune system

2638
03:13:52,580 --> 03:13:55,580
Especially considering the kind of foods that we're eating

2639
03:13:55,580 --> 03:13:57,580
If you're dealing with H. pylori bacteria

2640
03:13:57,580 --> 03:14:02,580
This is one of the main reasons why the body goes into a stress response

2641
03:14:02,580 --> 03:14:06,580
Address your H. pylori, that means get on probiotics

2642
03:14:06,580 --> 03:14:08,580
That means eat fermented foods

2643
03:14:08,580 --> 03:14:13,580
That means make sure that you're staying away from anything that has a negative effect on the digestive system

2644
03:14:13,580 --> 03:14:17,580
And use apple cider vinegar and digestive enzymes after your meals

2645
03:14:17,580 --> 03:14:20,580
If you have your gallbladder, keep it

2646
03:14:20,580 --> 03:14:24,580
Focus on fat absorption, that is the absorption of essential fatty acids

2647
03:14:24,580 --> 03:14:27,580
And the absorption of fatty vitamins

2648
03:14:27,580 --> 03:14:30,580
If somebody tries to talk you into having your gallbladder removed

2649
03:14:30,580 --> 03:14:34,580
Don't do it unless you have cancer in there, you need your gallbladder

2650
03:14:34,580 --> 03:14:39,580
80 million Americans are dealing with fatty liver disease

2651
03:14:39,580 --> 03:14:41,580
If you go to a doctor today he'll tell you

2652
03:14:41,580 --> 03:14:43,580
Oh it's just a normal part of aging

2653
03:14:43,580 --> 03:14:45,580
No it's not a normal part of aging

2654
03:14:45,580 --> 03:14:49,580
In fact they call it non-alcoholic fatty liver disease

2655
03:14:49,580 --> 03:14:53,580
They have to distinguish it from the kind of fatty liver disease that you used to have to drink

2656
03:14:53,580 --> 03:14:55,580
A pint of Jack Daniels to get

2657
03:14:55,580 --> 03:14:57,580
A pint of Jack Daniels every day to get

2658
03:14:57,580 --> 03:14:59,580
Today we're all getting that kind of disease

2659
03:14:59,580 --> 03:15:03,580
Focus on liver wellness by eliminating processed foods

2660
03:15:03,580 --> 03:15:07,580
Make sure you're eating less calories and you're getting more nutrients

2661
03:15:07,580 --> 03:15:12,580
And this is one of the major reasons why a nutritional supplement program is so important

2662
03:15:12,580 --> 03:15:16,580
Use liquid nutrients and use liquid foods as much as possible

2663
03:15:16,580 --> 03:15:19,580
It will remove the load off of your digestive tract

2664
03:15:19,580 --> 03:15:22,580
Give yourself a food holiday periodically

2665
03:15:22,580 --> 03:15:24,580
Practice intermittent fasting

2666
03:15:24,580 --> 03:15:29,580
In fact one of the most anabolic building strategies you could ever use

2667
03:15:29,580 --> 03:15:31,580
Is to practice intermittent fasting

2668
03:15:31,580 --> 03:15:34,580
Where you take a food holiday, you take a day off from food once a month

2669
03:15:34,580 --> 03:15:40,580
Once every couple of weeks it will actually stimulate the production of building hormones

2670
03:15:40,580 --> 03:15:44,580
Do everything you can do to turn on the building response

2671
03:15:44,580 --> 03:15:48,580
The body is a healing system, it's a regenerating system

2672
03:15:48,580 --> 03:15:52,580
You are witness to this healing and regenerating system every time you cut yourself

2673
03:15:52,580 --> 03:15:54,580
You can see how the skin heals

2674
03:15:54,580 --> 03:15:57,580
Well that same healing system that takes place in the skin

2675
03:15:57,580 --> 03:16:00,580
Takes place in the bones, takes place in the digestive tract

2676
03:16:00,580 --> 03:16:04,580
Takes place in the nervous system, takes place in the liver and throughout the body

2677
03:16:04,580 --> 03:16:07,580
Access this healing response that is your birth right

2678
03:16:07,580 --> 03:16:11,580
Nobody has to have a degenerative disease

2679
03:16:11,580 --> 03:16:17,580
In fact we know that there is a 1200 different disease states

2680
03:16:17,580 --> 03:16:21,580
Well really there is only one disease state and that is the disease of degeneration

2681
03:16:21,580 --> 03:16:24,580
And given that the body is a healing and regenerating system

2682
03:16:24,580 --> 03:16:28,580
Nobody has to deal with this degenerative process

2683
03:16:28,580 --> 03:16:31,580
However we have to participate

2684
03:16:31,580 --> 03:16:34,580
We have to take a role in our health

2685
03:16:34,580 --> 03:16:36,580
And that means not listening to the medical model

2686
03:16:36,580 --> 03:16:40,580
We have more doctors in this country per capita than any other country in the world

2687
03:16:40,580 --> 03:16:42,580
Than any other country in the history of the world

2688
03:16:42,580 --> 03:16:44,580
We spend more money per capita on health

2689
03:16:44,580 --> 03:16:49,580
Yet we are the sickest culture ever in the history of mankind

2690
03:16:49,580 --> 03:16:53,580
Clearly the modern medical model has failed us

2691
03:16:53,580 --> 03:16:58,580
Ambulatory medicine, not heroic medicine where you get stitched up after you get hit by a car

2692
03:16:58,580 --> 03:17:02,580
But ambulatory medicine, this idea that you can go to the doctor for your blood pressure

2693
03:17:02,580 --> 03:17:04,580
You can go to the doctor for your depression

2694
03:17:04,580 --> 03:17:07,580
You can go to the doctor for whatever kind of illness you have

2695
03:17:07,580 --> 03:17:10,580
Ambulatory medicine is not the answer

2696
03:17:10,580 --> 03:17:13,580
We are the answer, the divine force is the answer

2697
03:17:13,580 --> 03:17:16,580
And it works through simple things like deep breathing

2698
03:17:16,580 --> 03:17:18,580
Simple things like getting out in the sun

2699
03:17:18,580 --> 03:17:20,580
Simple things like eating whole food

2700
03:17:20,580 --> 03:17:23,580
Simple things like getting on a nutritional supplement program

2701
03:17:23,580 --> 03:17:26,580
And simple things like spirituality and praying as well

2702
03:17:26,580 --> 03:17:34,580
And truly health is a multidimensional process that works spiritually, mentally, emotionally and physically

2703
03:17:34,580 --> 03:17:36,580
All the dimensions have to be addressed

2704
03:17:36,580 --> 03:17:38,580
Spirituality is your business

2705
03:17:38,580 --> 03:17:41,580
Mentality means thinking correct thoughts

2706
03:17:41,580 --> 03:17:44,580
Every time you think a thought, Alex, it gets turned into biochemistry

2707
03:17:44,580 --> 03:17:47,580
Every time you feel a feeling, it gets turned into biochemistry

2708
03:17:47,580 --> 03:17:49,580
So making sure you're thinking clearly

2709
03:17:49,580 --> 03:17:50,580
You're not thinking fear thoughts

2710
03:17:50,580 --> 03:17:52,580
You're thinking powerful thoughts

2711
03:17:52,580 --> 03:17:55,580
Making sure you're addressing the emotional aspects of reality of your life

2712
03:17:55,580 --> 03:17:59,580
And making sure that you're focusing on physical well-being

2713
03:17:59,580 --> 03:18:02,580
Through the correct foods, through sunlight, through oxygen

2714
03:18:02,580 --> 03:18:04,580
And don't forget about a good exercise program

2715
03:18:04,580 --> 03:18:09,580
The body thrives under conditions of small amounts of stress

2716
03:18:09,580 --> 03:18:11,580
Stress is not a four-letter word

2717
03:18:11,580 --> 03:18:15,580
Small amounts of stress actually turn on this building process

2718
03:18:15,580 --> 03:18:18,580
The body likes small amounts of stress

2719
03:18:18,580 --> 03:18:22,580
And long, luscious, long periods of rest

2720
03:18:22,580 --> 03:18:24,580
And this combination of stress and rest

2721
03:18:24,580 --> 03:18:27,580
With appropriate nutrition and nutritional strategies

2722
03:18:27,580 --> 03:18:29,580
Along with mental and emotional strategies

2723
03:18:29,580 --> 03:18:31,580
Is the key to wellness and the key to health

2724
03:18:31,580 --> 03:18:35,580
And nobody, nobody, nobody has to deal with degenerative disease

2725
03:18:35,580 --> 03:18:39,580
They're all reversible, including cancer, FYI

2726
03:18:39,580 --> 03:18:41,580
Amazing information

2727
03:18:41,580 --> 03:18:43,580
In fact, let's do one more segment and come back with this

2728
03:18:43,580 --> 03:18:46,580
Younggevity news that I've got

2729
03:18:46,580 --> 03:18:47,580
Here it is

2730
03:18:47,580 --> 03:18:49,580
This is out of Yahoo Finance

2731
03:18:49,580 --> 03:18:55,580
AEL International announces results of Younggevity clinical research studies

2732
03:18:55,580 --> 03:18:59,580
Performed by Clemson University Institute of Neuromedical Research

2733
03:18:59,580 --> 03:19:00,580
Have you seen this?

2734
03:19:00,580 --> 03:19:01,580
I love it, Alex

2735
03:19:01,580 --> 03:19:05,580
I used to, you know, medical professionals, they need to see paperwork

2736
03:19:05,580 --> 03:19:06,580
Fine, there's the paperwork

2737
03:19:06,580 --> 03:19:08,580
I've been seeing it for 20 years

2738
03:19:08,580 --> 03:19:09,580
The paperwork I get is letters

2739
03:19:09,580 --> 03:19:10,580
That's my paperwork

2740
03:19:10,580 --> 03:19:13,580
Letters from people who tried to be on tangy tangerines

2741
03:19:13,580 --> 03:19:15,580
So now there's credentialed letters

2742
03:19:15,580 --> 03:19:19,580
There's credentialed information from Clemson University

2743
03:19:19,580 --> 03:19:21,580
And I love it and that's some powerful stuff, Alex

2744
03:19:21,580 --> 03:19:22,580
And they're the best

2745
03:19:22,580 --> 03:19:25,580
And that's what we carry at infowarshealth.com

2746
03:19:25,580 --> 03:19:26,580
And you support the broadcast

2747
03:19:26,580 --> 03:19:33,580
So we can launch Operation Paul Revere, $115,000 in cash prizes

2748
03:19:33,580 --> 03:19:35,580
$100,000 first place

2749
03:19:35,580 --> 03:19:37,580
I mean, there'll be a thousand entries

2750
03:19:37,580 --> 03:19:40,580
It'll reach tens upon tens of millions of people

2751
03:19:40,580 --> 03:19:44,580
ProLiberty Films, fiction, non-fiction, short, long

2752
03:19:44,580 --> 03:19:46,580
Go read the rules right now, launch today

2753

infowars.com, prisonplanet.com

2754
03:19:50,580 --> 03:19:53,580
A devastating blow exposing the globalist agenda

2755
03:19:53,580 --> 03:19:56,580
Whether it's the gun grabbing, all of it, you make the film

2756
03:19:56,580 --> 03:19:58,580
I'll judge it, you'll win

2757
03:19:58,580 --> 03:19:59,580
We'll be right back

2758
03:19:59,580 --> 03:20:01,580
People will wake up, that's the key

2759
03:20:01,580 --> 03:20:02,580
Hello, I'm Alex Jones

2760
03:20:02,580 --> 03:20:05,580
Myself, my family, the infowars.com team

2761
03:20:05,580 --> 03:20:08,580
Want to relay to you and your families

2762
03:20:08,580 --> 03:20:13,580
That we are intensifying our efforts against the globalist on every front

2763
03:20:13,580 --> 03:20:17,580
Infowars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats

2764
03:20:17,580 --> 03:20:20,580
But we can't do that without your help

2765
03:20:20,580 --> 03:20:24,580
By getting the films, bumper stickers and t-shirts at infowars.com

2766
03:20:24,580 --> 03:20:29,580
You will wake up people in your area and support our operation

2767
03:20:29,580 --> 03:20:31,580
As we move to the next level

2768
03:20:31,580 --> 03:20:35,580
We need your help to spread the word like never before

2769
03:20:35,580 --> 03:20:38,580
They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle

2770
03:20:38,580 --> 03:20:41,580
Between the forces of freedom and darkness

2771
03:20:41,580 --> 03:20:45,580
You are the response to the globalist technocrats

2772
03:20:45,580 --> 03:20:48,580
And their program of global eugenics dehumanization

2773
03:20:48,580 --> 03:20:50,580
And ultimate extermination

2774
03:20:50,580 --> 03:20:54,580
The war is here, it's an infowar

2775
03:20:54,580 --> 03:21:00,580
The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984

2776
03:21:02,580 --> 03:21:04,580

Hi this is Ted Anderson

2808
03:22:31,580 --> 03:22:34,580
Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors

2809
03:22:34,580 --> 03:22:36,580
Won't talk about gold IRAs?

2810
03:22:36,580 --> 03:22:38,580
They've been available since 1986

2811
03:22:38,580 --> 03:22:41,580
Yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement

2812
03:22:41,580 --> 03:22:45,580
Gold has outperformed paper investments yet no word about IRAs

2813
03:22:45,580 --> 03:22:47,580
If you would like to have gold for your retirement

2818
03:23:00,580 --> 03:23:02,580
Looking back on 2012 we ask ourselves

2819
03:23:02,580 --> 03:23:04,580
How did we ever survive?

2820
03:23:04,580 --> 03:23:06,580
From natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy

2821
03:23:06,580 --> 03:23:08,580
And the devastating summer drought

2822
03:23:08,580 --> 03:23:11,580
To the family hardships brought on by a disastrous economy

2823
03:23:11,580 --> 03:23:14,580
Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything

2824
03:23:14,580 --> 03:23:17,580
At eFoods Direct we hear from customers every day

2825
03:23:17,580 --> 03:23:19,580
That are fortunate enough to weather life's storm

2826
03:23:19,580 --> 03:23:21,580
By having a supply of food on hand

2827
03:23:21,580 --> 03:23:22,580
After Hurricane Sandy

2828
03:23:22,580 --> 03:23:24,580
Danny from New York City wrote

2829
03:23:24,580 --> 03:23:26,580
Almost all the grocery stores are closed

2830
03:23:26,580 --> 03:23:29,580
But I managed to get my eFoods just in time

2831
03:23:29,580 --> 03:23:31,580
To be able to help my sister and niece

2832
03:23:31,580 --> 03:23:34,580
It is better to be prepared 10 years too early

2833
03:23:34,580 --> 03:23:35,580
Than one day too late

2834
03:23:35,580 --> 03:23:37,580
I can warn you but I can't feed you

03:23:37,580 --> 03:23:39,580

2844

Yeah the Communist Party USA

2845
03:24:44,580 --> 03:24:47,580
Says they want us to turn our guns in

2846
03:24:47,580 --> 03:24:49,580
You know they're not going to be turning theirs in

2847
03:24:49,580 --> 03:24:52,580
No, no, they keep theirs, you turn yours in

2848
03:24:52,580 --> 03:24:56,580
They're real nice people

2849
03:24:56,580 --> 03:24:58,580
Oh boy, it doesn't matter, communists have killed

2850
03:24:58,580 --> 03:25:03,580
What about seven, eight times worldwide what Hitler did?

2851
03:25:03,580 --> 03:25:05,580
Wow, look at that, we ought to put their official logo

2852
03:25:05,580 --> 03:25:07,580
In that article we've got linked on Drudge at the top

2853
03:25:07,580 --> 03:25:10,580
That one that says CPUSA

2854
03:25:10,580 --> 03:25:12,580
And maybe we should slap that right up there

2855
03:25:12,580 --> 03:25:14,580
At the top of that article because it really says it all

2856
03:25:14,580 --> 03:25:16,580
And hey, they're working with Obama

2857
03:25:16,580 --> 03:25:18,580
There he is right there

2858
03:25:18,580 --> 03:25:20,580
Oh, we're in a lot of trouble right now

2859
03:25:20,580 --> 03:25:22,580
Oh, this is a good image right here

2860
03:25:22,580 --> 03:25:24,580
That actually ought to be added right there

2861
03:25:24,580 --> 03:25:26,580
That's the one right there

2862
03:25:26,580 --> 03:25:28,580
I'm going to have that added to the article

2863
03:25:28,580 --> 03:25:32,580
In closing, pharmacist Ben Fuchs is here with us

2864
03:25:32,580 --> 03:25:35,580
And this information is just amazing

2865
03:25:35,580 --> 03:25:38,580
And he looks 20 years younger than he actually is

2866
03:25:38,580 --> 03:25:41,580
Infowarshealth.com

2867
03:25:41,580 --> 03:25:43,580
I'm going to get this press release added up there to that site

2868
03:25:43,580 --> 03:25:45,580
I'm also going to get it added to Infowars.com

2869
03:25:45,580 --> 03:25:48,580
Briefly tell us about the announcement by the

2870
03:25:48,580 --> 03:25:51,580
Clinical research studies performed by Clemson University

2871
03:25:51,580 --> 03:25:54,580
And what they found about Beyond Tangy Tangerine

2872
03:25:54,580 --> 03:25:57,580
And some of the other products at Infowarshealth.com

2873
03:25:57,580 --> 03:25:59,580
Let me tell you something, Alex

2874
03:25:59,580 --> 03:26:02,580
People always want to know if they want one thing that they could do

2875
03:26:02,580 --> 03:26:04,580
Just to see how well this stuff works

2876
03:26:04,580 --> 03:26:07,580
And I'm telling you, if you try the Beyond Tangy Tangerine

2877
03:26:07,580 --> 03:26:10,580
There's no way you will not become a believer in nutrition

2878
03:26:10,580 --> 03:26:13,580
And it's because of this unbelievable concentration of nutrients

2879
03:26:13,580 --> 03:26:15,580
In a liquid format

2880
03:26:15,580 --> 03:26:18,580
The digestive system, the system that's designed

2881
03:26:18,580 --> 03:26:21,580
By nature to absorb nutrients over time

2882
03:26:21,580 --> 03:26:23,580
Becomes so overwhelmed that no matter what we're eating

2883
03:26:23,580 --> 03:26:25,580
No matter what we're taking

2884
03:26:25,580 --> 03:26:27,580
Especially in terms of nutritional supplements that come in pills

2885
03:26:27,580 --> 03:26:32,580
And the nutritional value of foods

2886
03:26:32,580 --> 03:26:34,580
We don't get the benefit of these things

2887
03:26:34,580 --> 03:26:36,580
Because our digestive system starts to break down

2888
03:26:36,580 --> 03:26:39,580
When you get your nutrients in a liquid format

2889
03:26:39,580 --> 03:26:43,580
Whether you're talking about soups or smoothies

2890
03:26:43,580 --> 03:26:45,580
Or vegetable juices

2891
03:26:45,580 --> 03:26:47,580
Or the Beyond Tangy Tangerine

2892
03:26:47,580 --> 03:26:50,580
You give your body nutrients with no work

2893
03:26:50,580 --> 03:26:52,580
That's why when you're sick you want the chicken soup

2894
03:26:52,580 --> 03:26:54,580
Exactly

2895
03:26:54,580 --> 03:26:56,580
You hit the nail on the head

2896
03:26:56,580 --> 03:26:58,580
When you're sick you want the Jewish penicillin

2897
03:26:58,580 --> 03:27:00,580
You want the chicken soup

2898
03:27:00,580 --> 03:27:03,580
Because you're getting the protein and you're getting the immune factors

2899
03:27:03,580 --> 03:27:05,580
And you're getting the sugars

2900
03:27:05,580 --> 03:27:07,580
The complex sugars

2901
03:27:07,580 --> 03:27:09,580
And you're getting that chemical that's so key

2902
03:27:09,580 --> 03:27:11,580
That's in the meat

2903
03:27:11,580 --> 03:27:13,580
I'm not sure which one that is

2904
03:27:13,580 --> 03:27:15,580
But you're getting lots of great protein in the meat

2905
03:27:15,580 --> 03:27:17,580
And you're getting it in a liquid format

2906
03:27:17,580 --> 03:27:19,580
You know the one that's in Turkey, it keeps escaping

2907
03:27:19,580 --> 03:27:21,580
You're talking about tryptophan

2908
03:27:21,580 --> 03:27:23,580
That's the famous tryptophan that we're talking about

2909
03:27:23,580 --> 03:27:26,580
And that's why they talk about tryptophan as being a sleepy kind of substance

2910
03:27:26,580 --> 03:27:28,580
Because it's so relaxing

2911
03:27:28,580 --> 03:27:30,580
That's another story

2912
03:27:30,580 --> 03:27:32,580
See how that's the real Prozac right there

2913
03:27:32,580 --> 03:27:34,580
That's your natural Prozac

2914
03:27:34,580 --> 03:27:36,580
5-HTP and tryptophan

2915
03:27:36,580 --> 03:27:38,580
Not that you're sleepy, you've finally gotten relaxed

2916
03:27:38,580 --> 03:27:40,580
You're relaxed, exactly

2917
03:27:40,580 --> 03:27:42,580
But back to your question about this Clemson study

2918
03:27:42,580 --> 03:27:44,580
What they found was

2919
03:27:44,580 --> 03:27:46,580
And exactly what I've been saying for years

2920
03:27:46,580 --> 03:27:48,580
Since I started using the young Japanese products back in the late 90's

2921
03:27:48,580 --> 03:27:51,580
When you take your nutrients in a liquid fashion

2922
03:27:51,580 --> 03:27:53,580
You notice results

2923
03:27:53,580 --> 03:27:55,580
And you notice them quickly

2924
03:27:55,580 --> 03:27:57,580
And the kind of results you get are global results

2925
03:27:57,580 --> 03:27:59,580
They're non-specific results

2926
03:27:59,580 --> 03:28:01,580
You lose weight

2927
03:28:01,580 --> 03:28:03,580
You have more energy

2928
03:28:03,580 --> 03:28:05,580
You feel better

2929
03:28:05,580 --> 03:28:07,580
You're not sleeping as much

2930
03:28:07,580 --> 03:28:09,580
You're not sick as much

2931
03:28:09,580 --> 03:28:11,580
That just affect the entire body

2932
03:28:11,580 --> 03:28:13,580
And that's why people lose weight without even trying

2933
03:28:13,580 --> 03:28:15,580
Do you know, Alex, that's the number one thing people say

2934
03:28:15,580 --> 03:28:17,580
When they're on the Beyond Tangy Tangerine

2935
03:28:17,580 --> 03:28:19,580
They lost weight and it wasn't even hard

2936
03:28:19,580 --> 03:28:22,580
And that is the beauty of a nutritional supplement program

2937
03:28:22,580 --> 03:28:24,580
You get healthy

2938
03:28:24,580 --> 03:28:26,580
And it doesn't require a lot of work

2939
03:28:26,580 --> 03:28:28,580
Because you know what?

2940
03:28:28,580 --> 03:28:30,580
It's your birthright

2941
03:28:30,580 --> 03:28:32,580
It's our birthright

2942
03:28:32,580 --> 03:28:35,580
This healing system is built into every one of the 100 trillion cells of the body

2943
03:28:35,580 --> 03:28:37,580
And let nobody tell you

2944
03:28:37,580 --> 03:28:39,580
That you have to take a drug

2945
03:28:39,580 --> 03:28:41,580
Or you have to have surgery

2946
03:28:41,580 --> 03:28:43,580
Or you have to have some doctor's interference

2947
03:28:43,580 --> 03:28:46,580
In order for you to be able to access this healing power

2948
03:28:46,580 --> 03:28:48,580
Armistice, Ben Fuchs

2949
03:28:48,580 --> 03:28:50,580
Thanks for spending an hour and a half with us today

2950
03:28:50,580 --> 03:28:52,580
Or almost that much time

2951
03:28:52,580 --> 03:28:54,580
And we'll talk to you very, very soon

2952
03:28:54,580 --> 03:28:56,580
Thank you for all you do

2953
03:28:56,580 --> 03:28:58,580
Thank you, my pleasure, Alex

2954
03:28:58,580 --> 03:29:00,580
Alright, folks, that's it for the live segment of the transmission

2955
03:29:00,580 --> 03:29:02,580
The in-studio interview with Dr. Jerome Corsi

2956
03:29:02,580 --> 03:29:04,580
Halfway in the first hour is coming up

2957
03:29:04,580 --> 03:29:06,580
You have your station tuned in and saying, I don't understand

2958
03:29:06,580 --> 03:29:08,580
It's been four hours, some days were three hours

2959
03:29:08,580 --> 03:29:10,580
Some days were three and a half hours

2960
03:29:10,580 --> 03:29:12,580
We sent out four hours

2961
03:29:12,580 --> 03:29:14,580
And for, I don't know, 15 years or so

2962
03:29:14,580 --> 03:29:16,580
14 years I did three hours

2963
03:29:16,580 --> 03:29:18,580
And for a couple years I did

2964
03:29:18,580 --> 03:29:20,580
I did four hours

2965
03:29:20,580 --> 03:29:22,580
But with the nightly news and the stuff

2966
03:29:22,580 --> 03:29:24,580
It just sometimes burned me out too bad

2967
03:29:24,580 --> 03:29:26,580
But now that I'm back

2968
03:29:26,580 --> 03:29:28,580
I've gotten on vitamins and minerals

2969
03:29:28,580 --> 03:29:30,580
I have more energy

2970
03:29:30,580 --> 03:29:32,580
So I'm kind of leaning towards four hours

2971
03:29:32,580 --> 03:29:34,580
Just officially again

2972
03:29:34,580 --> 03:29:36,580
789-9277

2973
03:29:36,580 --> 03:29:38,580
888-789-9277

2974
03:29:38,580 --> 03:29:40,580
Or 888-636-9277

2975
03:29:40,580 --> 03:29:42,580
And get others to go

2976
03:29:42,580 --> 03:29:44,580
And sign up as distributors

2977
03:29:44,580 --> 03:29:46,580
To get discounts at infowarshealth.com

2978
03:29:46,580 --> 03:29:48,580
It is a revolution

2979
03:29:48,580 --> 03:29:50,580
Information is power, the people perish

2980
03:29:50,580 --> 03:30:04,580
We're on the march, the empire's on the run, Alex Jones at the GCN Radio Network
