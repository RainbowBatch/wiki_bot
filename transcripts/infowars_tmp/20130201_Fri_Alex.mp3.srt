1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:37,040
he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.

3
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:43,120
Ladies and gentlemen, get ready, strap yourselves in. It is Friday, the first day of February

4
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:49,040
2013. We're gonna be here for the next three hours, and then we'll return, Lord willing,

5
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:56,000
this Sunday, as I always do, 4 to 6 PM Central Standard Time, 5 to 7 PM Eastern for the Sunday

6
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
transmission.

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,440
She hadn't been on in about four or five months. Rosa Corey, who's one of the best researched,

8
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:08,680
well-spoken firebrands hailing from, where, San Francisco, and the author of Behind the

9
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:15,640
Green Mask, U.N. Agenda 21. She will be joining us coming up in the second hour to talk all

10
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,160
things Agenda 21.

11
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:24,480
Because that is the global treaty to bring in deindustrialization in a system designed,

12
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:33,280
economies designed to implode in concentric rings down to a feudal system where we are

13
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:42,680
under total social engineer control. And again, everything is Agenda 21, everything is eugenics.

14
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:49,760
And as I do more and more research, it just slams me like a ton of bricks how accurate

15
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,760
we are.

16
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:55,120
And I'm not saying we're accurate, we're good people. I'm saying we know what we're talking

17
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:03,160
about. We've got them, we have them. This morning, I was almost late to work, because

18
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:07,760
in amongst my other duties in the morning, I ended up watching about 45 minutes of the

19
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:14,000
video that is academic and very dry, but bone-shilling.

20
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,180
And the article is up at infowars.com. Population control propagandist, this is at Yale. We

21
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:28,400
get very little opposition from the public through the sitcoms, drama, and TV. We get

22
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:34,660
very little opposition of the public because of the very gradual evolution of the characters.

23
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:39,640
And here they are admitting what we already know, that the dramas, the sitcoms, the soap

24
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:46,600
operas, not just here, but worldwide, are globalist-financed. ABC, NBC, CBS all get

25
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,640
Melba Melinda Gates money that ends up going to these shows.

26
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:55,000
And it's the same thing in Africa, Asia, you name it, to demonize the family, to demonize

27
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:03,820
private property, to demonize liberty. And it's the ultra mega rich on record doing this.

28
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:09,000
And what's sick is, yes, you can argue there are areas that are overpopulated, like some

29
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:16,560
areas of India are absolutely hellish, areas of China absolutely hellish. That's not debatable.

30
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,200
It's that they use the pretext of dealing with population to bring in a total control

31
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:27,000
grid and actually target the middle class and the nouveau riche and the real intelligentsia

32
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,480
that are threats to the old robber barons.

33
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:34,840
And they're using this whole population thing as a cover to bring in a new dark age that

34
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:40,920
they're exempt from in their technological reservations. I mean, this is earth shattering

35
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:51,320
key, key, key, key, key, key information. I mean, this is the real way the world works.

36
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:56,980
This is why everything's happening. We have a socially engineered system where the general

37
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:02,080
population is obsolete. They don't just plan to try to have clean industries put in where

38
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,680
people end up only having two children on average or less. And population goes into

39
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,640
a negative push, whether it's Japan, the US, Italy, Germany, every country is the same.

40
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,680
You see, I've actually read the population reports. I've actually read Ehrlich's books.

41
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:20,000
I've actually read Paul Ehrlich's books and the rest of them. And the Henry Kissinger

42
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,280
documents memorandum 200, State Department memorandum 200, 7277, all of them. I mean,

43
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,160
I see all of them, thousands. I mean, that's all I do.

44
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:34,140
So much I can't even, I don't even remember 10% of what I've read. I mean, it's so mountainous.

45
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:40,200
It's so congruent. It's so mechanized. It's so clear cut. It's so diagrammed. And I can

46
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:44,960
walk out and see it in the billboards, the culture, the TV. I don't even need to, I can

47
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,960
see what they're doing.

48
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:50,000
Let me go type in and look for a white paper saying this. And I go type it in. I know their

49
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,740
language. I find the exact white paper with the exact words I just envisioned of them

50
00:04:54,740 --> 00:05:01,760
talking about how they planned five years ago, what I'm looking at now.

51
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:06,600
Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive from natural disasters

52
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,200
like hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on

53
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:16,280
by a disastrous economy? Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything. At eFoods

54
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:20,360
Direct, we hear from customers every day that are fortunate enough to weather life's storm

55
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:24,900

56
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:29,680
wrote, almost all of the grocery stores are closed, but I managed to get my eFoods just

57
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:35,340
in time to be able to help my sister and niece. It is better to be prepared 10 years too early

58
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:39,920
than one day too late. I can warn you, but I can't feed you. Heed the warnings and do

Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty, it's Alex Jones.

87
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:28,360
Thank you for joining us, listening across the United States, whether it's on our 150

88
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:34,880
plus AM and FM affiliates, Global Shortwave, the internet at Infowars.com or prisonplanet.com

or watching us at Infowarsnews.com, the TV version of the radio transmission, or of course

90
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:45,080
listening by the internet or shortwave all across the world.

91
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:52,720
Thank you so much for tuning in on this Friday, the first day of February, 2013. Probably

92
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:59,460
one of the most well-spoken, focused fighters against the eugenics, new dark age, global

93
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:05,000
government system of Agenda 21. Rosa Corey will be joining us, hadn't been on in about

94
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
four months.

95
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,440
She was on the nightly news a few months ago, but hadn't been on with me in about four or

96
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:13,380
five months. She's going to be joining us in the second hour and in studio. Pastor Steve

97
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:18,500
Anderson is one of the people in an amazing new film that we're carrying. He's the preacher

98
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:25,160
who lives in Arizona and has to drive through a border patrol checkpoint 100 miles in.

99
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,160
They all know who he is and always want to search his vehicle. And he says, why don't

100
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,660
you do something about the illegals? So they beat him up. That's not why he's joining us,

101
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:35,300
but that video has been seen millions of times online. A lot of folks know him because of

102
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,300
that.

103
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:43,580
Also, he has prayed for the downfall of President Obama before, which is biblical, and he's

104
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:46,720
been demonized nationally for that. That's probably how some of you will know him. But

105
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:52,400
after the tribulation, Let No Man Deceive You, powerful new Christian film. And even if you're

106
00:09:52,400 --> 00:10:00,080
not a Christian, what are there? A billion, 200 million Catholics and another billion

107
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,560
or so other sects of Christians.

108
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:07,580
So that's two billion plus Christians out there. People who claim they're Christians,

109
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:12,500
some estimates are 80% of Americans identify themselves as Christians, though not really

110
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:20,080
practicing, but still believe in God and identify with Christ. Christians from the lion's den,

111
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:25,440
and of course that was Jews, but that's what Christianity came out of right through to

112
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:34,500
all the prophets, right through to 50, 60, 70, 100 years after Christ in Rome.

113
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,000
The Christians said slavery was wrong, and it was mainly white slaves that were slaves

114
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,120
from all over. You weren't Roman, you could be a slave. It was the Christians that helped

115
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:47,160
phase out slavery 2000 years ago. It was Christians who wouldn't worship other gods and were thrown

116
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:53,380
to the lions. And this is all on record. Why do Christians submit to tyranny today? Why

117
00:10:53,380 --> 00:11:00,000
did Christians found America by saying no king but King Jesus, King George is a tyrant,

118
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,260
and led that rebellion, but today why do they submit?

119
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:10,000
And the biggest issue is they teach a pre-tribulation rapture. So we're gonna examine that. And

120
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,400
again, even if you're not a Christian, this is important anthropology, important sociology,

121
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:19,900
important psychology. The globalists study all the groups out there, and then they manipulate

122
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,080
us against each other.

123
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:26,440
So I study Islam, I study Christianity, I study it all. I study Satanism, the occult.

124
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:36,120
I am a Christian. I studied it all, animism, atheism, agnostics, Rosicrucianism, Aleister

125
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:43,540
Crowley, baloney stuff, all of it. And I'm telling you, the globalists believe in God,

126
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:47,480
and they believe in spiritual forces. I mean, how do you know when somebody's looking at

127
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,480
you?

128
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,920
You can be walking through the woods on your own property on 1,000 acres. I know I've been

129
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:56,820
doing that before on my family's property in East Texas. And repeatedly, I know when

130
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:00,800
somebody's looking at me, and I'm always right. You always know in the restaurant, you feel

131
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,860
somebody staring at you, turn around and somebody's looking at you. And it's somebody you knew

132
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:10,640
years before, they're like, I thought that was you, Bob, thought that was you, Carol.

133
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:16,000
They've proven, that's how a monarch butterfly, four generations can fly to northern Canada,

134
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,880
and then one flies all the way back using the sun and magnetic systems, windage, everything,

135
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:26,920
flying at 10,000 feet all the way to Mexico. That's the incredible cells they found in

136
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:33,440
fish, they found in birds, and they're in humans as well, that are electromagnetic,

137
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:40,920
and that are picking up on all sorts of not just magnetic systems, but cells they don't

138
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,240
know exactly what they do, but that are antennas.

139
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:50,440
I mean, you're picking things up, the globalists know this, they're obsessed with it. And they

140
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:55,080
want you to be dumbed down and unaware of it. Most of the major atheist movements, the

141
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:59,880
low level atheist, think they know it all and are real intellectual, and they never

142
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:03,360
believe it, even in government corruption, that couldn't exist. Things that are admitted

143
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:09,680
can't exist, it's a very one dimensional, dried, stale perspective, I don't blame people

144
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,680
wanting to be atheist.

145
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:14,480
You look at establishment religion, boy, that would make me an atheist any day, or at least

146
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:20,920
an agnostic. But the spiritual, it's definitely real, and humans for our entire history have

147
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:26,560
known this, so there's always priest, a priesthood who tries to get between you and the universe,

148
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:34,360
you and God. You and God's creation, the universe, there's always that priesthood that wants

149
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:42,160
to get between you and your creator, you and the power that is God's creation.

150
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:52,040
Because that's where the proof of the civilization, the proof of the intelligence is the civilization,

151
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:58,000
is the creation, is the master builder. People say, that's Illuminati, master builder, great

152
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:04,780
architect. God is called the great architect and the master builder in the Bible, the Luciferians

153
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:14,360
take everything and they take it onto themselves, every symbol, every name, they take it and

154
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:18,120
then there's no symbols left, there's no names left, they've taken them all, they've stolen

155
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,120
them.

156
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,160
Oh, you're talking about something that's the devil, no, you are looking at the counterfeit.

157
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:27,440
Now, I'm not gonna preach cuz I got a bunch of news to cover, we'll get to that coming

158
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,680
up with the pastor in studio with us today. He's also gonna be on the Nightly News with

159
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:35,120
Darren McBrain for an in-depth commercial free, commercial free during the interview,

160
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:43,520
as commercials, as bookends on the TV show of 7 o'clock central every night, Infowarsnews.com.

161
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:47,560
But the new film is available, Let No Man Deceive You after the tribulation and it goes

162
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:52,000
well with Romans 13, The True Meaning of Submission by Chuck Baldwin and his constitutional lawyer

163
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,680
son Timothy Baldwin.

164
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,560
Great to give to every preacher, filled with the, I don't know, it's gotta be a hundred

165
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:01,920
Bible verses about it's your job to stand up against evil and corruption and bullies

166
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:06,920
and thugs. And that if you don't, God will absolutely hate you more than anybody else,

167
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:12,480
that you knew innocents were being hurt and you weren't evil but you were a coward.

168
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:18,280
God hates a coward, you need to get that straight. Justice hates a coward, common sense hate

169
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:25,480
a coward, women hate a coward, children hate a coward, and cowards hate themselves. A man

170
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:31,240
who has courage only dies a single death. Cowards die thousands of deaths. Every day

171
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,680
is fear, fear of people think, fear of what's gonna happen.

172
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:47,080
I absolutely hate fear. I absolutely despise it, because it does kill your intellect. It

173
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:56,520
is the mind killer, to quote a great writer and I'd say philosopher, Frank Herbert. Fear

174
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:02,520
is the mind killer, fear is the little death. You let it pass through you, over you, around

175
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:07,400
you, past you, behind you. Get behind me Satan, get behind me. People say, what does that

176
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,600
mean get behind me?

177
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:15,320
Get out of my way, get out of the road, get out of my way, stop it, get out, get out.

178
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:21,240
The devil accuses, tells us all day how we're bad, we're evil, we're guilty. And we all

179
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:25,040
are guilty one way or another, but are our hearts guilty? Are we doing it on purpose?

180
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:31,040
Do we love evil? No, and that's why, that's why the system tells you you're bad so that

181
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:37,480
you feel guilty, so you step aside. When you run into the devil on the road, there is no

182
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:43,560
turning back, there is no turning back on the road. There is no turning back on the

183
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,160
run.

184
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:57,920
But we're not running from the devil, we're trying to run to God. Because it's a race,

185
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:03,600
and the devil, whatever you wanna call it, doesn't want us to achieve that level of awakening

186
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:09,640
and understanding. Consciousness, the system wants to keep you within this control box

187
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:15,960
feeling small, feeling ugly, feeling powerless, feeling scared so that you don't break out.

188
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:22,840
Climb to the surface, come out of the cave, Plato's cave, THX 1138, Robert Duvall climbs

189
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:32,640
to the top, allegory of the cave and sees the world. Logan's run, climbs out from the

190
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:43,400
subterranean system of control, the technocracy, and sees the open earth.

191
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:49,440
An artificial system to control us. And again, there's an hour and a half video, excuse me,

192
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:58,320
an hour and 50 minute video up at infowars.com right now. Population control propaganda,

193
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,920
we get very little opposition from the public. And they go on to say, we get very little

194
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:05,040
opposition from the public because of our television programs.

195
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:10,000
They are a very gradual evolution of the characters. And what do they say, to end the family, to

196
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:16,040
end fealty, to end any type of honor, where you're just a nobody that's programmed by

197
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:21,000
the television, by the culture. And they say, by increment, we do it. And it's everything

198
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,140
I've talked about, it's everything Alan Watts talked about, because it's all in Eber Bernays'

199
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,080
three books.

200
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:32,220
The father of modern propaganda, Sigmund Freud's nephew. When you go watch it, they're sitting

201
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:37,280
around giggling and getting off on the fact that they're manipulating you because you're

202
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:45,440
trusting. And you look at these men, these are weak, power grasping, shaking men who

203
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:52,260
have a look of egomania in their eyes, that they are world controllers, that they are

204
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,840
engineering you, that they have taken control.

205
00:18:54,840 --> 00:19:01,560
And they are world saviors, and they're there to all these PhD students doing their dissertation

206
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:05,200
in this Yale hour 50 minute thing. It's a nightmare, I haven't even watched the whole

207
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,840
thing yet. I watched about half of it, it was very painful. Cuz I already knew it 100

208
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:15,120
times over, but just to see them smacking the lips and doddering around. These people

209
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:22,760
are all cold and intelligent to one level, but they miss any depth or variety or versatility.

210
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:27,520
Or they would absolutely run the other direction. And they talk about the Rockefellers, everybody

211
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:34,540
funding them, and Maurice Strong, and Paul Ehrlich, and John P. Holdren, and all of it.

212
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:39,320
And how I was just here 40 years ago like you, and I've led the worldwide program for

213
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:46,200
the engineering program in television to break down the family, to help the family. And you

214
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:51,440
will soon be in this force. I mean, it's all there, and you're just like watching soldiers,

215
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,440
armies built, and they're not even actually trying to reduce population.

216
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:01,520
I'll tell you about that when we come back and then get into all the other big news.

217
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:06,320
Looking back on 2012, I know personally I'm thanking God that my family and I made it

218
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:10,280
through the year from natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer

219
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:14,520
drought to the family hardships brought on by a disastrous economy. Our hearts go out

220
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:18,600
to those that have lost everything. My friends at eFoods Direct hear from customers every

221
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:22,840
day that are fortunate to weather life's storm by having a supply of food on hand. Danny

222
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:27,320
from New York City wrote in following Hurricane Sandy and said, almost all the grocery stores

223
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:31,400
are closed, but I managed to get my eFoods just in time to be able to help my sister

224
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:35,520
and my niece. Bottom line, it's better to be prepared 10 years too early than one day

225
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,520
too late.

231
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:07,440
Is 2013 your year to achieve more? More vitality, more health, more well-being? Hi, this is

232
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:12,400
Pastor Jenny. For 25 years, I spent my life's work teaching others how to achieve more.

233
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:18,160
But in 2010, I got a lesson of my own about RNA drops. I learned that there are millions

234
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:22,800
of gene switches latent in every single cell of my body that are waiting for an activator.

235
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:28,000
I learned by taking RNA drops, I could begin to activate that power in my cells and achieve

236
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,240
the more that I desire. I'd like to share what I discovered with you and send you a

237
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:38,080
free 30-day supply of RNA drops valued at $50 for just the cost of shipping and handling.

245
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:36,900
why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs? They've been available

246
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:42,240
since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.

247
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,520
Gold is outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs. If you would like to have

264
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:19,840
You have found it, the tip of the spear in the fight to awaken free humanity, not just

265
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:25,880
in the US or North America, but worldwide. I am your host, Alex Jones. And remember if

266
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:30,100
you're a new listener tuning into us on AM and FM stations all across the country, those

267
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,160
are precious affiliates.

268
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:36,840
And the fact that this broadcast is exploding, even though we come from a smaller independent

269
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:41,800
radio network, not one of the big three giants, is unprecedented in the history of modern

270
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:48,260
radio. And it's because station managers, owners, and sponsors in your area understand

271
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:52,340
that a lot of what I've talked about unfortunately is now coming true. They realize we're in

272
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:56,760
trouble and they want to get this information out to you as a service.

273
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:00,800
So be sure and spread the word about all the stations you're listening to. And be sure

274
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:06,560
and sponsor the local station if you're a business owner. And be sure and support the

275
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:14,560
sponsors and let them know you appreciate it. That is so important. That is so important.

276
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:19,720
Because people at Yale, Yale's come out recently and said, let's kill babies, some of the professors

277
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:24,280
up to age three, even if they're healthy. It's been in the Journal of Bioethics. That's

278
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:29,720
the new death panel groups where they get their walking orders.

279
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:33,760
They say, well, the death panel, the bioethics board, says it's okay, so now we can kill

280
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:38,020
you. And then the police go, well, they're wearing a white lab coat, it must be okay.

281
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:41,680
That's how Hitler did it. He got his first tyranny into the medical system. And I'll

282
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:44,800
get more into this with Rosa Corey coming up on June 21. I want to get into all the

283
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:50,300
other economic news that is incredibly important. Huge purges of gun owners have begun, legal

284
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,360
gun owners.

285
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,480
This is moving faster than I thought. More giant military drills on a stage. We've never

286
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:59,920
seen anything. This is an order of magnitudes bigger. There's huge drills every day in major

287
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:06,520
cities terrorizing people to acclimate the public for military occupation. It's all coming

288
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,520
up.

289
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,500
But here's what I want to explain to you. And we covered a lot in my film, it's been

out six years, in game blueprint for global enslavement. Available on DVD at info wars.com

291
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:21,440
but in higher quality or in prisonplanet.tv, but it's free on YouTube, folks. But don't

292
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,780
have it be pearls before swine, okay?

293
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:29,480
Go watch it. It has an online bibliography. What is the endgame.com? What is the endgame.com

294
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:35,040
so you can double check every 30 seconds. We have it marked on the time code with a

295
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:40,400
bibliography. Where the UN says they want to exterminate at least 80% of the public,

296
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:45,880
where they state it's US government policy, the British Royal Commission on population.

297
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:50,220
Anything we quote in the film, it's right there. Even if it's George Herbert Walker

298
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:55,360
Bush calling for world government, new world order, everybody knows he did that.

299
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:59,160
And we show the State of the Union, we still give the date, where they said it and where

300
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:07,640
we got it. The date in Congress of the United States, State of the Union. I mean everything

301
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:13,880
documented, it's like an online film book. Here's my basic indictment. We've had the

302
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:17,160
different population associations on that have broken down the numbers. These numbers

303
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:20,460
are fact, you can look them up.

304
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:29,480
The eugenicist 150 years ago, well actually about 163 years ago now, by 1850, the robber

305
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:35,900
baron British royalty and others, even the other financial elite were interbreeding.

306
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:41,520
So they were having a lot of deformed children, mentally ill children. The reason they started

307
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:48,520
marrying commoners by the 1930s or so was because Queen Elizabeth has a bunch of siblings

308
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:54,160
and all of them had to get locked up, just completely insane and deformed and it's a

309
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,720
very sad story.

310
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,420
But that's why they've now been forced to marry commoners. See, they're so elite they

311
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:04,760
can't even have kids because of the psychos inbreeding together. And I mean psychos, they've

312
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:10,080
inbred psychopathic traits to create, certain breeds of dogs are overbred and completely

313
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:17,200
insane and everybody knows that. It's many times worse with humans. I mean most Egyptians,

314
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:24,600
that's why they would have a dynasties collapse over and over again.

315
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:30,640
Because the oldest live would live to be about 20. And imagine these would be completely

316
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:38,640
mentally retarded, king, sterile, unable to talk, totally deformed, and they would prop

317
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:43,400
them up and worship them as God. And then whatever utterances came from their mouth,

318
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,600
they would then follow immediately.

319
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:50,920
And this is what we go through. So they were obsessed with, why are we dying? Why are we

320
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:54,800
deformed? And so all their scientists said, we're gonna discover it. So they discovered

321
00:28:54,800 --> 00:29:04,760
genetics out of it, came eugenics, well, first eugenics, then genetics, then bioethics, biometrics

322
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,600
is over 100 years old.

323
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:11,520
Everything you know, the first computers, IBM was commissioned by the Rothschilds and

324
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:16,680
Rockefellers to create computers to try to track why the elites were having, most of

325
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:21,640
their kids were dying at stillbirth. And this is all on record, race studies, the Hollerith

326
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:25,440
machines, it was IBM machines, the Nazis had to put the tattoos on people.

327
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,480
I'm gonna come back and finish this. I say I'll do it simply, but it's just incredible.

328
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:33,920
This is everything. This is why it's all like this. And they've made the decision to cut

329
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:40,440
off the resources incrementally over time, cuz they've learned you can't resist that.

330
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:43,720
I'm gonna explain it all when we come back and then get into why all this other stuff

331
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:50,440
is happening. Because if you don't know this basic foundation, you won't know anything.

332
00:29:50,440 --> 00:30:03,320

He's bounding down. Are we going to do what they say? Ladies and gentlemen, I have reverse

365
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:21,760
engineered this entire thing and it isn't hard. The global list of all written books

366
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:28,000
going back over 160 years describing the problems, why they've done what they've done, why they

367
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:33,160
made the decisions because they see the general public as absolute dumb animals.

368
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:39,520
Really the general public just isn't lusting after power. The general public is a mix of

369
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:47,480
good people, bad people, ugly people, evil people, sweet people, creative people, eccentric

370
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:54,160
people. It takes all kinds to make the world go round. But hereditary power always ends

371
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:58,120
up taking over whether it's North Korea, whether it's the kings of Europe, whether it's the

372
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:02,560
kings of Japan, the emperors, whether it's been the kings of the Chinese.

373
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:07,520
The communist always just end up turning the Politburo into an above the law hereditary

374
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:13,640
royalty. You go to places like North Korea, they're now in some cases four generations

375
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:19,800
into people who are given the seat on the government council or given the seat in the

376
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:26,360
local government job. And given the house that their grandfather had that was given

377
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:29,560
to them by the communist.

378
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:34,160
And this is what they set up. And so imagine you've got inbred groups already inbreeding

379
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:40,320
for being aggressive, being ruthless, being cunning, being smart. Let's say if your ancestor

380
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:46,320
is William the Conqueror, who was particularly powerful king, obviously out of France, was

381
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:52,200
France today, because he was from a commoner.

382
00:34:52,200 --> 00:35:01,600
A king in that area mated with a particularly aggressive barbarian woman. And so then you

383
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:08,720
get William the Bastard, as he was known, and he then goes into England and takes over.

384
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:12,500
So they weren't all psychopaths, but they were cunning, smart, aggressive. Then you

385
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:16,960
inbreed psychopaths, control freaks, sadists, because they're willing to do the horrible

386
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:17,960
things to stay in power.

387
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:24,920
In fact, they enjoy it. So it's an attribute for their type of cancer to take control,

388
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:30,240
to see the general public as cattle, the prey animal, they the Morlocks, we the Eloi. They

389
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:34,360
use an H.G. Wells analogy, which he wrote nonfiction books admitting that was an analogy

390
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:39,600
of the ruling class and the general population. That we were pure, that we were beautiful,

391
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,880
that we were sweet, didn't matter.

392
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:47,960
You won't rule things from the subterranean keep like the Morlocks. You're going to be

393
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:52,920
fed on. And when one of you gets grabbed and drug away, the others will just run and hide

394
00:35:52,920 --> 00:36:00,480
in the bushes but come back out. And so that's what they do, that they see us like animals.

395
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:07,000
They say we're animals. And the entire technological system, unlimited money, the unlimited stolen

396
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:13,880
money of countries and peoples and tribes and other empires has all been poured.

397
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:20,040
Imagine you're the elite. You say all my kids are dying. My royal line is dying. We've got

398
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:27,580
massive mental illness. That's why this whole government system, this train that's already

399
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:33,160
been built, that we've been put on, that's a self-oiling mechanized perpetual motion

400
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,260
system.

401
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:40,240
That's why it just continues forward because thousands of trillions in the aggregate and

402
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:47,460
that's conservative, has been pumped into it in the last 160 plus years. And a melding

403
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:52,800
of the ancient empires, a melding of the ancient royal systems, the corruptions, all the corrupt

404
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:57,960
minions that served and climbed into the ranks to become lords.

405
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:04,080
And then to add their genetics to the pool of the super shark, super aggressive cancer.

406
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:09,600
It's a cancer cell in a body system. They're right, we are a collective, but the individual's

407
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:14,560
what makes us strong. An individual operating correctly is the opposite of the collective

408
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,000
but is within the collective.

409
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,780
They create a false collective where a cancer program is overlaid. And they know it's a

410
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:25,520
cancer and know it will destroy the old system, which they live off of. So they decided to

411
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:31,400
fully re-engineer the entire old system where everything else is eradicated and it's only

412
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:37,520
cancer. And this is not going to work. It's never worked, but they believe technology

413
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,240
is going to allow them and they all talk about this.

414
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:47,000
Bertrand Russell and Ted Turner and Paul Ehrlich, they all write these papers. I've listed them

415
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,720
here, I've made films about them where they sit and talk about this. It just thinly, thinly

416
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:57,920
in many cases not even failed. And so that's why they've gone to a system now where they're

417
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:02,040
gonna shut off the resources incrementally to bankrupt you and make you go under their

418
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:07,680
control so they can then sterilize you, so they can then death panel you, so they can

419
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,040
then euthanize you.

420
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:13,920
And that's why they brag that they fund and run most of the big sitcoms, movies, dramas

421
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:18,720
with product placement, propaganda placement, that they're now, you hear it on the shock

422
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:24,640
radio. You see it in the movies, making fun of old people, making fun of babies, saying

423
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:30,440
children are gross, being married is stupid. Men are all dumb, women are in charge, not

424
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:34,200
to empower women to isolate them and to make them be under state control and only trust

425
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,600
the state as their husband.

426
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:42,040
And that's what they say, the state will be the husband. And so they're taking control

427
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:46,960
of the human system at a subconscious level. And they even write about this, they realize

428
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:54,000
it because they hate the strength of the unwashed masses. They hate the vigor, they hate the

429
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:01,100
hybrid power. They hate it to the ends of the earth, it is a glaring light to them.

430
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:05,040
And they want it blotted out. So really, this is why I indict them and I'll give the rest

431
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:10,520
of the news. The globalists know that once you industrialize a country and even bring

432
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:15,960
in clean industry, that the population, I said goes down to about, for every two adults

433
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,480
they have on average two children.

434
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:23,260
That's not actually accurate. In the entire industrialized world, it's about 1.5. The

435
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:28,820
US is right at two people for every two, but that's because of the 10 million or so immigrants

436
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:33,340
brought in every five years. We're actually imploding as well. I mean, it's different

437
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:38,000
numbers every year, but it's about 1.3 children for every two children in Italy, about 1.3

438
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,480
to 1.2 in Japan.

439
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:50,240
It's about 1.5 in Germany. It's about 1.3, 1.4 in Russia. It's about 1.3 in Britain,

440
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:57,320
if you cut out the immigrant influx. So the West is dying. And this was done through social

441
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:03,000
engineering, done through the 50s and 60s, social revolution sold as empowerment but

442
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,840
actually destroyed the family, to get both people working.

443
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:10,840
So now the state raises your children, very diabolical plan. Now, that's the plan they're

444
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:17,080
going with in the West. They have a surface plan in Africa, Asia, Latin America claiming

445
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:21,840
that through the sitcoms and dramas and conditioning. And they admit it's all conditioning and laugh.

446
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:25,200
Look at the little animals, they don't know we're doing this. And they stand around. I

447
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,640
mean, I got a video posted at info wars.com.

448
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:31,200
Top professors, top globalist, the head of the UN program, and they just sit there and

449
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:35,080
laugh at you that this is all public. And they talk about how they're gonna incrementally

450
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:40,080
do this. And they've got all the PhDs out there, all the people about to get their PhDs

451
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:44,560
in the graduate program, sitting there listening to this getting off on it.

452
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:49,420
And they go to TED TV events and they have the intelligentsia there, the technocrats

453
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:53,060
there, the mid-level technocrats. And they say, yeah, we're gonna reduce this number

454
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:58,760
and show an equation of humans with carbon dioxide and show it going to zero, which means

455
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:04,180
zero humans. Everybody laughs and Bill Gates laughs. See, it's all a laugh because that's

456
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:05,480
gang sign.

457
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:09,560
It's like they speak another language. It's an equation, very simple equation. But they

458
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:13,760
know people watching that, how are they even gonna know an equation? They don't know what

459
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,560
the three branches of government are. They show an equation that they're going to kill

460
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:22,740
us. And he actually says, we've gotta get this number down to zero, using vaccines to

461
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:24,060
lower their population.

462
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:31,320
He even says it, shows the equation, and then they all laugh. Yeah, it's funny to them,

463
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:36,320
cuz they're not really trying to save the planet. That's how they get the low-level

464
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:41,920
people into this. They're a bunch of inbred psychopath sadists up top. And you read the

465
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:47,000
1949 Royal Commission on Population, that's the blueprint of all the modern stuff we followed.

466
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,800
Ehrlich, the UN, agenda 21, UNESCO, all of it.

467
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:58,560
You read all of that, Biological Diversity Assessment 96, all of it. They say, well,

468
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:04,040
if we go in and do clean industry, or even give them basic horticulture, and drill wells

469
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:11,720
for them, water wells. They talk about how the Christian missionaries are going in and

470
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:14,080
actually helping people, and that's gonna be a problem.

471
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:18,000
They go, we've gotta come in claiming we're helping, but we've gotta block all this development,

472
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,720
even though it'll lower their population. And they'll start having less than two kids,

473
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:27,000
because they'll be informed, they'll wanna have some more wealth. They won't need ten

474
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,560
kids, cuz half of them are gonna die to take care of them in their old age.

475
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:34,360
Plus, the only wealth you have as being really poor is children. By the way, it is the real

476
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:39,520
wealth. But the point is, is that the globalists all know they've all got five, six, seven,

477
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:44,680
eight, nine, ten kids, they all know that. Ted Turner's got five, biggest landowner and

478
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:50,840
15 jet airplanes, all the rest of it. You're a useless eater, he's not, according to his

479
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,340
mindset.

480
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:58,240
So you've got all this going on, they blocked, and they say this in the 1949 Commission on

481
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:03,480
Population. You can pull up the synopsis online, you've gotta go to a big library to find it.

482
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:07,440
We've done it, we've shown it in film, shown the screenshots. They admit, they just say,

483
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,640
we're just gonna keep them from industrializing.

484
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:15,800
That'll cause a population explosion, but we'll then just mitigate that. And of course,

485
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:20,560
that's the vaccines and programs at a certain point, but we wanna use that cheap labor pool

486
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:27,040
in select development zones with a mercantile model, that's globalism, 2.0 is globalism

487
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,040
of mercantile.

488
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:33,760
A selective system, a selective insider crony system where they pick the winners to leverage

489
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:39,920
out the West so we can then social engineer them. So they wanna social engineer the West

490
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:47,120
cuz we're the real target. Highest education, highest IQ, genetically in the studies, whatever

491
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:50,880
issue you wanna look at, that's the main target.

492
00:43:50,880 --> 00:44:01,600
Of course, these are all averages. And they're also targeting the Chinese, again, they're

493
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:07,640
also targeting the Japanese, but they're targeting every other country, ladies and gentlemen.

494
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:11,860
And countries like Africa are just slated for extermination. That's why some countries

495
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:18,340
have lost half their population in the last 30 years. I mean, this is so diabolical.

496
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:23,820
To grow a giant people bomb, point out the problem, offer your solution, globalism, which

497
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:28,320
is really blocking clean energies that are developed while claiming you're promoting

498
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:29,320
them.

499
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:32,760
And then only using that as wealth transfers in boondoggles that aren't even supposed to

500
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:40,860
work on record. Solyndra and others where they don't even build anything and fake electric

501
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:46,280
cars while blocking carburetors in the 70s that got 100 miles to the gallon on record.

502
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:56,120
I mean, this is so evil, ladies and gentlemen, because they're cheating. They're not smarter

503
00:44:56,120 --> 00:45:02,160
than us that they're in control. These royals in almost every dynasty, no matter which group

504
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,800
they were, African royals, and there were plenty of those.

505
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,520
There was a King of Africa that ruled the Middle East for a while, probably richest

506
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:12,980
man in history. So you can look that up and show that richest man in world history was

507
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:18,760
African. The Asians had their kings, all of it, it's the same system that they are willing

508
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:24,960
to then always kill whoever became the king or the queen would then kill or lock up their

509
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:28,200
family members.

510
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:33,680
Meet Manza Musa, the first of Mali, the richest human being in all of history. And there's

511
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:38,880
an example and a painting of him. Okay, so this is the type of stuff that goes on and

512
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:43,440
they all operate the same. So just like a grizzly bear will go and smell, a male grizzly

513
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:50,520
bear will go and smell a male baby and try to kill it.

514
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:55,860
Because he sees it as a threat later in territory and food and mates, just like lions and tigers

515
00:45:55,860 --> 00:46:01,940
do that. The system is doing that, but to all of us in a power grab, they see us as,

516
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:07,880
and we can show the article out of the UN just last week, as locust, as a horde of locust.

517
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:15,160
Grasshoppers coming and eating all the plants down to the roots. They see us as a disease

518
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:17,700
because this is their world they've conquered.

519
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:23,520
But then the sick thing is they actually increased populations, kept them from stabilizing as

520
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:30,600
a people bomb to leverage out the West and sell the West on eugenics ideas. Cuz most

521
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:33,920
trendies will tell you, of course there's too many people, of course, yeah, of course

522
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,360
they're putting stuff in the water.

523
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:39,040
What do you think we've got to do this for the Earth? They're not even doing it for that.

524
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:45,640
They're doing it to just control everybody and their main target. It's come out a decade

525
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:49,200
ago or more. They have school study tests where they give them to sixth and seventh

526
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:53,920
graders and the boys that show the highest aptitude, black, white, doesn't matter, and

527
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,600
who show the leadership traits.

528
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:59,320
Those are the ones that get flagged. You get called into the principal's office or the

529
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:04,280
nurse's office and they say, you're a troublemaker, we wanna put you on Ritalin. Even when the

530
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:08,620
people aren't troublemakers, they try to put them on it because it's targeted to cause

531
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:13,300
neuron death, brain shrinkage, and also organ problems.

532
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:17,480
The heart gets larger and has ventricle issues. That's just a few of the side effects. This

533
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:24,520
is a scientific program laid out in grids like we're animals in a coyote extermination

534
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:31,480
program or something. They're trying to wipe people out, dumb down their opposition, neutralize,

535
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:37,100
put the public in a trance, and then carry out the orderly, gradual, ambient extermination

536
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:38,760
of the general population.

537
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:43,140
Now there's Margaret Sanger quote, the most merciful thing that a family does to one of

538
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:49,740
its infant members is to kill it. She was talking about kids period. This is a death

539
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:56,160
cult. And so these people stand around like they're saviors of the world. They're not

540
00:47:56,160 --> 00:48:00,560
saviors of the world, they are stealing the world.

541
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:04,760
And by the way, it's the globalists doing open air genetic planting all over the planet.

542
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:09,200
They're the ones with thousands of laboratories, thousands firing gene guns into random plant

543
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:16,760
animal, bacterial, you name it, organisms to create mutations. They're the ones releasing

544
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:21,160
the ingredients to mousepox for humans that kills over 90% of those that come in contact

545
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:22,880
with it, and it's airborne.

546
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:28,160
They're the ones, these UT professor Pianca and Dr. Peter Singer, what at Princeton, go

547
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:33,360
look up any head of a biology department, type in eugenics population control. You're

548
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:38,940
not let in to the club unless you're for this. That's why Pianca, remember this famously

549
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:43,280
five years ago, gave a speech to the Texas Academy of Sciences. He got their highest

550
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:44,280
award.

551
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:49,240
It's been to Europe. And he said, I look forward to the airborne Ebola being released and 90%

552
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:54,040
of us dying, including my family. It's sad, but it's for the better. And there was a standing

553
00:48:54,040 --> 00:49:07,720
three minute ovation. Photos were taken, newspapers reported with crying. Even my family's gonna

554
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:15,000
die. And everyone was so moved by it. Yes, all the top Texas Academy of Sciences people.

555
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,640
I talked to the reporters that were there. They were taking photos and covered it. And

556
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:24,960
they estimated 90% stood in the ovation and it went on for three minutes as he projected

557
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:33,440
on the PowerPoint a giant screen of pile of red skulls, red skulls.

558
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:39,120
He actually went and did a Google search later of that photo. It's a Rwandan pile of skulls.

559
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:44,520
You can actually do the image search. Giant red pile of skulls and they're in their church.

560
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:53,760
They're in their church standing ovation, standing ovation, standing ovation. It's their

561
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:57,120
church. It's their time to cry. It's their time to have a sacrament. It's their time

562
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:59,500
to take the blood of Satan, not the blood of Jesus.

563
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:04,840
It's their time to take communion. It's their time, it's their time, it's their time, their

564
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:09,960
time. And as your factory shut down, as your businesses shut down, as things bankrupt and

565
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:14,760
rot, they see it as a victory. As Detroit falls, they see it as a victory. And then

566
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:20,360
they all are building a Gen 21 compact subsystem districts that are openly known in the planned

567
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:26,720
Opelis documents in all their statements as the governing corporate stakeholder zone.

568
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:32,280
Those will be armored. Those will be lavished. The latest medical systems, the latest entertainment,

569
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:37,040
unlimited power. Those areas are exempt from the rolling blackouts already globally going

570
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:41,760
in. They turn our power off now on rolling blackouts in Austin to the point we have to

571
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:42,760
have generators.

572
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:46,760
They're talking about taxes on those, but the quote government district downtown and

573
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:53,000
the key agenda 21 new high rises, they are exempt and they're exempt from the increased

574
00:50:53,000 --> 00:51:01,840
power prices. The city of Austin decides what you pay according to your needs. They decide

575
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:07,040
food storage, check survival tools, check weapons and water filters, check. But what

576
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:11,640

603
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:29,580
Folks, I know I'm ranting. You should be ranting, too. You should be really upset,

604
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:35,820
as well. I mean, this is all public. I mean, if you go to infowars.com or prisonplanet.com

605
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:40,700
in the featured news section, population control propaganda, we get very little opposition

606
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:46,920
from the public because we are very gradual evolving the characters on the TV shows.

607
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:51,580
This is going on all over the world. And it's got the quotes in there about how they're

608
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:57,200
basically breaking up society and the family to save the earth from population and how

609
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:02,700
it's all Paul Ehrlich's plan and how it's the UN plan. And this is at Yale. And there

610
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:08,820
are literally thousands of these videos where they sit around and the Yale put this on its

611
00:55:08,820 --> 00:55:12,720
science section website. They're not hiding this, okay?

612
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:16,380
Cuz they know the average person that watches TV, you tell them, hey, there's messages in

613
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:19,860
there, there's messages in there. They're like, yeah, right, there's messages where

614
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:25,300
we live in the Soviet Union. That's why you've got all the anti-gun messages, all the anti-founding

615
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:30,620
father messages. I was last night up here working and I saw a clip of that Milwaukee

616
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:35,820
sheriff on Piers Morgan, I guess on Monday, I'd missed it, or Tuesday.

617
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:41,900
It'd been a few days ago and Piers Morgan was sitting there talking to him about, why

618
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:47,780
aren't you for any background checks? Why don't you wanna close the loopholes? And the

619
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:53,060
sheriff's like, because it doesn't work. Criminals are still gonna get guns. And that's the whole

620
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:56,960
point. There's already background checks on law abiding citizens.

621
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:02,980
But they're using that to come after us. And I've got gun purge news where that's happening

622
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:06,620
of people with no criminal record, veterans and others, getting arrested and charged with

623
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:13,900
felonies in New York before the law even went into effect. Checkpoints where it's a routine

624
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:21,940
vehicle check. You have a 30 mag clip in a bag in your backseat and you're going to jail.

625
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:27,540
That's to a veteran who's involved running a program raising money for other veterans.

626
00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:31,020
One big awards in the community and people are like, he's a veteran, he wins awards.

627
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:36,140
Why is the sheriff's department, why is the grand jury throwing the book at him? You're

628
00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:40,620
the enemy. You're a robot that's now to be decommissioned. You've gone out and fought

629
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:44,580
for the New World Order and shot up with the deadly vaccines and they're not killing you

630
00:56:44,580 --> 00:56:45,580
fast enough.

631
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:51,940
The DU isn't killing you fast enough. You're supposed to come back here and die or go to

632
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:56,060
prison. You're the number one enemy. You're what Homeland Security is targeting. I've

633
00:56:56,060 --> 00:56:59,460
got all these articles where vets are getting targeted. It's like it's weird, they're pulling

634
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:02,860
vets over. The cops just say they're pulling me over for no reason.

635
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:07,660
They've got your license plate scanned. You're in a database. It's telling them in many of

636
00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:13,300
these major cities to pull you over. See now it's not just warrants or priors with these

637
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:18,300
scanners. It's now vet. That's a vet, pull him over. And they know when they're vets,

638
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:19,300
they walk over.

639
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:26,900
So you're a vet, got back from Iraq last year. Get out of the car. I'm gonna search it. Look,

640
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:31,380
look, they're coming for everybody, okay? They're coming for us. They wanna start a

641
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:35,880
civil war. They've got a purge going. I've got a stack of articles on that front. This

642
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:41,380
is social engineering, where they hire cops now that'll follow orders and show they'll

643
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:42,380
follow orders.

644
00:57:42,380 --> 00:57:44,900
And they put them on the street and a lot of them will do whatever they're told. You've

645
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:48,780
either got departments run by good people that are saying, get guns, protect yourself.

646
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:52,700
This is tyranny. You got 1,000 plus Green Berets signing a public letter saying they're

647
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:57,380
gonna resist this and it's tyranny. You've got people showing whose side they're on.

648
00:57:57,380 --> 00:58:01,340
You're either gonna kneel to this or you're gonna resist it. And we better resist it in

649
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:09,340
the Infowars right now. By the way, we go to infowarsstore.com. We are giving away 150,000

650

Reaching war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.

668
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:13,060
Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does

669
01:00:13,060 --> 01:00:24,660
he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.

670
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:34,780
All right, Rosa Corey, firebrand, great research author. He's going to be joining us in the

671
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:39,780
next segment. Give us an update on Gena 21, the latest info there. I haven't even gotten

672
01:00:39,780 --> 01:00:45,860
into all the news. I'll intersperse it in this hour and the next. Pastor Steven Anderson

673
01:00:45,860 --> 01:00:49,740
is going to be joining us in studio as well with a new film we're going to be talking

674
01:00:49,740 --> 01:00:50,740
about.

675
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:56,540
I haven't even gotten into all the other news yet. I mean, just look at this financial news.

676
01:00:56,540 --> 01:01:02,700
It's just amazing. Another Harvard study finally getting attention out of the Huffington Post.

677
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:06,580
I thought it's a conspiracy theory, Huffington Post. Harvard study confirms fluoride reduced

678
01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:14,980
to children's IQ massively, reviewing more than 27 other studies by governments and major

679
01:01:14,980 --> 01:01:16,620
universities.

680
01:01:16,620 --> 01:01:21,620
Reduces IQ, increases cancer. And of course, that's just sodium fluoride when they put

681
01:01:21,620 --> 01:01:27,980
in the hydrofluorosolic acid. Of course, Paul Ehrlich and the Lighthouse Science are John

682
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:32,240
V. Holder, and I mean, they talked about that. It's an adjuvant to accelerate all the other

683
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:38,780
soft kills. The bisphenol A's accelerates those, turbo charges them.

684
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:44,300
The aluminum dioxide they're spraying on us, all the other goody goods. And then of course,

685
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:50,140
the globalist all religiously like the plague. On record, the Chinese elite, the US elite,

686
01:01:50,140 --> 01:01:56,980
you're appealing, they all literally obsess on purified water organics religiously. But

687
01:01:56,980 --> 01:02:03,820
they want you to have it, cuz they care about you and your family.

688
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:07,220
They're good people. Now, I started plugging this, but ten seconds does not have to plug

689
01:02:07,220 --> 01:02:15,660
it. If you go to infowarsstore.com, and you go to the bumper sticker area, you'll see

690
01:02:15,660 --> 01:02:23,460
it says free stickers. You can also buy them at cost, at cost, like 4.99 for 50 stickers.

691
01:02:23,460 --> 01:02:30,580
But if you wanna get them totally free, no shipping, no money, 0, 0, 0, 0. Might be one-tenth

692
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:35,460
of a cent the amount of computer energy you use, electricity, while you're on the website.

693
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:39,180
So I guess it may cost you about one-tenth of a penny. But that's your own money or electricity

694
01:02:39,180 --> 01:02:42,900
bill. I guess I lied, it's not totally free. But I'm not charging you anything. If you

695
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:47,260
wanna start splitting hairs, how many angels can dance on the head of a possum?

696
01:02:47,260 --> 01:02:50,860
All of this type of stuff, how many chimpanzees can dance on the head of a pin? I've made

697
01:02:50,860 --> 01:02:55,240
that term famous now. You can go there and we've got, I don't know, like six or seven

698
01:02:55,240 --> 01:03:00,940
new bumper stickers that are also available for sale. But you can get these for free,

699
01:03:00,940 --> 01:03:07,740
50 of them. But you've got to copy the pledge and send it back to our email for our liability.

700
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:12,600
Cuz I already have homemade stickers where LA sends me a bill saying someone stuck a

701
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:13,600
homemade sticker up.

702
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:17,520
If somebody sticks an Obama sticker up in LA, do they send me $100 bill saying they'll

703
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:21,300
arrest me? Of course, obviously, I'm not gonna pay it, it's made up. It's not even one of

704
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:24,800
our stickers. Everybody gets to sell bumper stickers to put on people's cars. It's not

705
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:30,420
my fault if somebody buys a can of Coca-Cola and goes and throws it at somebody.

706
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:35,020
Are we gonna blame the Coca-Cola company? I mean, again, that's an example of what we're

707
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:39,980
talking about here. But you have to just be over the top, just wherever you want it sent,

708
01:03:39,980 --> 01:03:44,660
you just send the email back with the attached PDF, pledging to put it on your own property

709
01:03:44,660 --> 01:03:47,740
or to give it to others who wanna put it on their property.

710
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:52,740
And it's 50 stickers, that's easy to give out. It's a great conversation piece. It's

711
01:03:52,740 --> 01:03:56,660
all available at infoawastore.com. Now, I put it on YouTube last night, we can give

712
01:03:56,660 --> 01:04:05,160
out about 3,000 groups of 50. As of this morning, about 1,600 had already been given out. So

713
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:08,220
by the time I plug this, everyone's gonna rush in there.

714
01:04:08,220 --> 01:04:10,980
So that doesn't mean everybody's gonna get them free. We'll probably pull the offer by

715
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:18,140
the end of the show. But youareindangerinfoawastore.com, that'll get people talking. It's a great conversation.

716
01:04:18,140 --> 01:04:26,100
There are so many great new stickers. And again, we got 150,000 printed, another 30,000

717
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:32,860
of the same stickers for sale at cost, at cost, at cost. You pay the shipping and 4.99

718
01:04:32,860 --> 01:04:36,220
or 4.95 for 50, and that is the cost.

719
01:04:36,220 --> 01:04:41,660
I had them break it down. That is the cost. That is the cost. Bumper stickers at cost

720
01:04:41,660 --> 01:04:46,300
for those that wanna help us do more. And if we get donations and we get financial support

721
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:51,880
and the money comes in, I'll start doing this every month. Cost is like $20,000, I think,

722
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:53,900
to get the stickers and ship them.

723
01:04:53,900 --> 01:04:58,940
I think Weldon said 30,000, but the point is, it'll reach tens of millions conservatively.

724
01:04:58,940 --> 01:05:01,340
It's part of Operation Paul Revere.

725
01:05:01,340 --> 01:05:06,600
Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers. The prognosis for the entire planetary

726
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:12,300
economic system runs from bad to worse. The globalist model is to shut down societies

727
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:17,460
and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover. That's why we've assembled

728

756
01:08:12,660 --> 01:08:20,180
Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin,

757
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:22,180
Texas, Alex Jones.

758
01:08:22,180 --> 01:08:42,580
Ladies and gentlemen, it is Friday, the first day of February, 2013, and we're going to

759
01:08:42,580 --> 01:08:47,380
be going to a very special guest, the author of Behind the Green Mask, U.N. Agenda 21,

760
01:08:47,380 --> 01:08:56,020
Rosa Corey, a book we sell at the mfowarstore.com online book video slash patriot bookstore.

761
01:08:56,020 --> 01:09:02,540
Very important to get that book and get that out to county commissioners, sheriffs, police,

762
01:09:02,540 --> 01:09:07,220
city planners, cuz most people are following agenda 21. They just don't know because they're

763
01:09:07,220 --> 01:09:08,660
compartmentalized.

764
01:09:08,660 --> 01:09:16,660
This is basically the red pill with a green cover. Okay, the green red pill. Now, before

765
01:09:16,660 --> 01:09:23,260
we go to her, this is the type of news that I have here in front of me. And this is all

766
01:09:23,260 --> 01:09:28,540
up at prisonplanet.com and mfowars.com. This is now every day. I've never seen the magnitude

767
01:09:28,540 --> 01:09:34,340
of huge invasions, practicing taking over government buildings, universities, facilities,

768
01:09:34,340 --> 01:09:39,500
public schools. They're now saying the army will respond to, quote, domestic terrorism.

769
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:43,340
And they're calling terrorism, quote, gun crime. The whole homeland security system

770
01:09:43,340 --> 01:09:47,900
officially to go after gun owners. This is a way to purge people. And speaking of that,

771
01:09:47,900 --> 01:09:53,960
also up at mfowars.com, and this is in the local news, decorated combat veteran arrested

772
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:58,540
charged with five felonies for possession of an AR magazine.

773
01:09:58,540 --> 01:10:03,100
Those are now illegal in New York State. And it turns out his family's just now speaking

774
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:09,340
out, this happened before it was even officially implemented. They don't care. And it said

775
01:10:09,340 --> 01:10:13,980
a routine vehicle check. They have checkpoints all over New York now, folks. They now have

776
01:10:13,980 --> 01:10:18,900
them in Texas. They're gun checkpoints. They call them gang checkpoints, vehicle checkpoints.

777
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:23,960
And they know you're a vet, it's in the computers, and they're going after you. And again, it's

778
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:27,740
not every jurisdiction, but some of these jurisdictions have really evil police.

779
01:10:27,740 --> 01:10:31,500
They're now hunting the veterans, and that's on record. Department of Homeland Security

780
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:36,860
targets gun collector. And the KRQE piece I wanna play later, they're like, well, they

781
01:10:36,860 --> 01:10:41,140
caught him by this. And then it goes on to say he hadn't done anything wrong, and then

782
01:10:41,140 --> 01:10:43,500
he's a firearms importer of decades.

783
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:49,920
And they claim a serial number might not have been properly on one rifle. And it's a local

784
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:54,540
gun dealer. And they go, well, he might not have filled out all his forms right. And the

785
01:10:54,540 --> 01:10:59,300
news acts like he's the, and they have a neighbor woman. You gotta see the video at mfowars.com

786
01:10:59,300 --> 01:11:04,780
on the KRQE going, he's just so evil, I mean, my gosh, I saw the guns, I saw them bringing

787
01:11:04,780 --> 01:11:05,780
the guns out.

788
01:11:05,780 --> 01:11:12,780
I hope something's done about him. I mean, just amazing. So we've got that, Newtown calls

789
01:11:12,780 --> 01:11:20,740
for armed school officers. Gun control officials set sights on ammunition and background checks

790
01:11:20,740 --> 01:11:27,700
now to take those guns. Teams shot at Atlanta school, but they had an armed police officer

791
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:30,020
there, so it got stopped, so that's the answer.

792
01:11:30,020 --> 01:11:34,220
Suspect suicide bombing kills two at US Embassy in Turkey. Well, that's really heating up

793
01:11:34,220 --> 01:11:39,100
over there. That's some of the news on that front we're gonna be getting into. DHS revamping

794
01:11:39,100 --> 01:11:44,500
immigrant welcome materials set to include Obamacare, how you don't just get your babies

795
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:47,720
paid for now, free Obamacare.

796
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:52,780
But citizens have to buy the insurance, and the official IRS website says they may make

797
01:11:52,780 --> 01:11:58,440
families buy up to $20,000 a year as a new average within three years. This year, premiums

798
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:06,380
are set to double from average of 5,000 to 10,000 per person. Within three years, 20,000

799
01:12:06,380 --> 01:12:13,540
per family, cuz it's mandated, written by the insurance companies, my gosh, unbelievable.

800
01:12:13,540 --> 01:12:18,940
That's CNS news, Obamacare to soon cost average American family 20,000 a year, natural news

801
01:12:18,940 --> 01:12:26,300
story up at infowars.com by Mike Adams. Stocks jolted by jobs data, Dow briefly test 14,000,

802
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:30,940
that's cuz of dollar devaluation, the real economy is going into free fall.

803
01:12:30,940 --> 01:12:39,380
Excuse me, gas prices heading up again. Yep, now it's time for inflation, 8.5 million Americans

804
01:12:39,380 --> 01:12:45,380
left labor force in the last four years. 169,000 Americans drop out of labor force in January

805
01:12:45,380 --> 01:12:49,540
alone. Yeah, hey, listen, I was realizing I was about to hire some more crew members,

806
01:12:49,540 --> 01:12:51,940
but I just realized they're gonna force me to get Obamacare.

807
01:12:51,940 --> 01:12:57,180
I don't know if I can keep who I've got. Anyways, all part of the agenda 21 shutting down the

808
01:12:57,180 --> 01:13:01,840
economy. You can have a coal power plant, but we're gonna bankrupt it. Again, this is

809
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:08,260
the admitted program to bankrupt us because only the insiders are exempt from everything.

810
01:13:08,260 --> 01:13:14,680
Now joining us is a lady that more and more, other than maybe myself or somebody like Glenn

811
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:21,540
Beck is out there really exposing agenda 21, something I've been covering for 17 years.

812
01:13:21,540 --> 01:13:24,460
And I'm proud of the fact that we forced this out in the open.

813
01:13:24,460 --> 01:13:28,660
She wrote the best little book, cuz other books out there are like fiction and stuff

814
01:13:28,660 --> 01:13:36,260
about this, so really weird. Hers is nonfiction, it's only 168 pages long, great bibliography

815
01:13:36,260 --> 01:13:42,500
at the bottom of each page. Behind the green mask, you want agenda 21, all the information

816
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:46,260
you need to understand what is happening in your town, why it's happening, who's behind

817
01:13:46,260 --> 01:13:48,100
it, and what you can do to stop it.

818
01:13:48,100 --> 01:13:53,720
Awareness is the first step in resistance. She is a ASA forensic commercial real estate

819
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:59,100
developer and appraiser specializing in eminent domain valuation. Only 30 years of experience

820
01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:02,860
analyzing land use and property, now it's over 30 years, enabled her to recognize the

821
01:14:02,860 --> 01:14:07,100
planning revolution sweeping the nation while fighting to stop huge development project

822
01:14:07,100 --> 01:14:08,100
in her city.

823
01:14:08,100 --> 01:14:12,700
She researched the corporate, political, and financial interests behind it and found Unigine21.

824
01:14:12,700 --> 01:14:20,100
Rosa speaks across the nation and is a regular blogger on her website, DemocratsAgainstUnigine21.com.

825
01:14:20,100 --> 01:14:25,940
Now again, we sell her book at InfowarsStore.com. My point here is, and we're gonna go to her

826
01:14:25,940 --> 01:14:29,220
and give her the floor for the first few segments, and I've got some questions and I wanna open

827
01:14:29,220 --> 01:14:31,820
the phones up for your questions.

828
01:14:31,820 --> 01:14:35,980
We've gone every town around Austin, Austin's a command base of this, every town's being

829
01:14:35,980 --> 01:14:40,980
taken over by it. And what it means is, you can't build an office on your house you've

830
01:14:40,980 --> 01:14:46,260
owned for 30 years and got two acres. Your property taxes are gonna go up, your power

831
01:14:46,260 --> 01:14:47,700
prices are gonna double.

832
01:14:47,700 --> 01:14:53,460
But the selective insiders who get waivers, their power bill gets cut. That's happening

833
01:14:53,460 --> 01:14:58,180
in Austin, that's happening in San Francisco. Government has the lowest rate. Next is groups

834
01:14:58,180 --> 01:15:02,500
that get certified by the local environmental council, but you can't get certified unless

835
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:08,520
some payoffs get made. This is open criminal mafia, but they act like trendy liberals,

836
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:09,520
so it's a cover.

837
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:14,700
But you go to their meetings, it's the Dallas Cowboys are there locally, retired ones, big

838
01:15:14,700 --> 01:15:19,840
bank heads, Republicans. That's why all the Republicans leadership's behind this, Mitt

839
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:26,360
Romney, you name it. It is bipartisan, global screw job. Now, you can't cut a tree what

840
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:30,420
ten inches around in Austin, even if it's an invasive cedar, they'll come and find you.

841
01:15:30,420 --> 01:15:35,860
I know one guy got to find something like $50,000 in a week for cutting invasive cedars

842
01:15:35,860 --> 01:15:38,140
growing up under his fence at his wrecking yard.

843
01:15:38,140 --> 01:15:44,680
So it's not even a plant from here, but they can cut down giant five foot around oaks if

844
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:48,820
they wanna build something. So that's just the tip of the iceberg. I'll take you now

845
01:15:48,820 --> 01:15:54,740
to Rosa Corey joining us via phone cuz she's on the road. She's traveling the entire US,

846
01:15:54,740 --> 01:16:00,180
battling them. And she's been very, very effective because on many other issues, she's what you

847
01:16:00,180 --> 01:16:01,660
call a liberal.

848
01:16:01,660 --> 01:16:06,020
But a real liberal, someone who's more like Thomas Jefferson, who wants everybody to have

849
01:16:06,020 --> 01:16:12,140
equality and freedom. The system that calls itself liberal, they are the globalist operatives

850
01:16:12,140 --> 01:16:18,000
using that as camouflage. And she joins us now, and we're gonna break in four minutes.

851
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:23,100
But roll through the basics of what it is, how they're adapting to our counter strike

852
01:16:23,100 --> 01:16:27,520
against them, and some of the biggest criminal actions they're engaged in right now, Rosa

853
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:28,520
Corey.

854
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:33,860
Hey, Alex. You know, what we're talking about here is the erection of a totalitarian state

855
01:16:33,860 --> 01:16:41,020
right in front of us. This is what globalization is. It's the standardization of all systems.

856
01:16:41,020 --> 01:16:46,380
And so you're seeing it in every possible element, every possible aspect of your life

857
01:16:46,380 --> 01:16:53,060
from healthcare to law enforcement to schools to land use, water use, restrictions. This

858
01:16:53,060 --> 01:16:59,860
is the way that corporations take over. This is the corporatocracy. So what do corporations

859
01:16:59,860 --> 01:17:05,820
want? They want low wage workers, global markets, standardized systems, and they want to destroy

860
01:17:05,820 --> 01:17:11,140
competition. And this is what we're getting here. This is artificial scarcity all over

861
01:17:11,140 --> 01:17:17,740
the world, whether you're in the UK or Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United States, EU,

862
01:17:17,740 --> 01:17:24,580
wherever you are, this is the globalization of all systems. And we're experiencing this

863
01:17:24,580 --> 01:17:29,300
now because we have a long way to fall in the United States in order to bring us to

864
01:17:29,300 --> 01:17:35,220
the same level as developing nations. So when you think about corporatocracy, it's about

865
01:17:35,220 --> 01:17:41,140
developing new markets. There's no loyalty to existing markets. So if we collapsed into

866
01:17:41,140 --> 01:17:48,980
poverty or slightly below the median for the entire world, that is of no concern to the

867
01:17:48,980 --> 01:17:55,380
huge corporations. What they're looking for is to bring up the very low third world

868
01:17:55,380 --> 01:17:59,900
nations so that they can buy their goods and work cheaply. This is what we're looking

869
01:17:59,900 --> 01:18:06,420
at. This is what we're dealing with here. This is a totalitarian state being erected

870
01:18:06,420 --> 01:18:12,960
because they need to control all system inventory and control. That's what this is about.

871
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:17,020
And the cover is it's for the earth. But I've been to the smart growth conferences as early

872
01:18:17,020 --> 01:18:21,180
as 97. In fact, we have some bombshell video that Mike Hanson has that he needs to upload

873
01:18:21,180 --> 01:18:25,260
to his YouTube channel, my camera guy at the time, where they were just admitting it's

874
01:18:25,260 --> 01:18:29,860
a takeover. They'd laugh when my camera was off and just go, of course, it's a takeover.

875
01:18:29,860 --> 01:18:34,940
And I had some really mean Dallas cowboy guy. I forget his name. He's famous, big white

876
01:18:34,940 --> 01:18:39,140
guy with long, long gray hair. Just push me out of the way. Just like, yeah, you better

877
01:18:39,140 --> 01:18:43,860
get out of my way. I mean, they know what they're doing. Yes, they do know what they're

878
01:18:43,860 --> 01:18:48,260
doing. And that's, you know, this is really hard for people to believe. They think, well,

879
01:18:48,260 --> 01:18:52,380
you know, this can't be possible. How can this be going on, for instance, in the United

880
01:18:52,380 --> 01:18:58,420
States, the totalitarian, you know, dictatorship happening. But this is what it looks like.

881
01:18:58,420 --> 01:19:02,500
People are not aware that this is what it looks like in your town. They're not going

882
01:19:02,500 --> 01:19:08,660
to call it agenda 21. They'll call it sustainable development. They'll call it regional plans.

883
01:19:08,660 --> 01:19:16,380
You'll see it as water and land use restrictions, smart growth, wild lands project, common core

884
01:19:16,380 --> 01:19:20,260
in the schools, that standardization of your school. And they'll lie and say, we're going

885
01:19:20,260 --> 01:19:24,300
to give you park land. We're going to take this farmer's land is 5000 acres and not pay

886
01:19:24,300 --> 01:19:28,020
him anything. We're just going to take it. Then they turn around and build condos on

887
01:19:28,020 --> 01:19:32,700
it that that the mayor who takes it his buddy builds the houses. I mean, it's it's just

888
01:19:32,700 --> 01:19:33,700
unbelievable.

889
01:19:33,700 --> 01:19:38,380
Yeah, this is about what they're doing is it's a completely unlevel playing field because

890
01:19:38,380 --> 01:19:44,500
they're using your taxes to subsidize low income development and high density transit

891
01:19:44,500 --> 01:19:45,500
oriented.

892
01:19:45,500 --> 01:19:49,260
So they can raise the general public's taxes even more. That's what Bloomberg says. Let's

893
01:19:49,260 --> 01:19:52,580
talk about that. You're going to live in a 250 square foot San Francisco is doing it

894
01:19:52,580 --> 01:19:57,980
to apartment. They're going to raise your taxes in an actuary to force you into that.

895
01:19:57,980 --> 01:20:00,900
We'll be right back with the incredible social engineering.

896
01:20:00,900 --> 01:20:06,980
Injuries, slow healing, aches and pains, constipation, weakness, fatigue are all common. The older

897
01:20:06,980 --> 01:20:11,260
one gets the progressive deterioration of the body that occurs almost universally. The

898
01:20:11,260 --> 01:20:15,580
older one gets can partly to significantly be prevented with conscientious attention

899
01:20:15,580 --> 01:20:21,180
to nutrition. If the Hanselman can play rugby in their 90s, then it is possible for everyone

900
01:20:21,180 --> 01:20:25,700
in North America to experience a more youthful life as well. One key ingredient to warding

901
01:20:25,700 --> 01:20:30,580
off aging and reversing some of it is the type and quality of protein consumed all protein

902
01:20:30,580 --> 01:20:35,740
foods or supplements you currently consume are heat damage, destroying 50 to 75% of your

903
01:20:35,740 --> 01:20:41,140
ability to utilize the bodybuilding amino acids. One world way is not heat damage and

904
01:20:41,140 --> 01:20:47,400
allows your body to utilize 100% of the amino acids. This feat no one else has achieved.

905
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:55,620

918
01:22:00,740 --> 01:22:04,940
On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth

919
01:22:04,940 --> 01:22:09,940
to retire and live out their golden years. Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost

920
01:22:09,940 --> 01:22:14,780
of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty

921
01:22:14,780 --> 01:22:19,140
line. Is this a flaw for the enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve

922
01:22:19,140 --> 01:22:24,260
Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes? These questions

923
01:22:24,260 --> 01:22:28,700
and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.

924
01:22:28,700 --> 01:22:32,920
Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank

925
01:22:32,920 --> 01:22:38,500
power. A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel. Hi,

926
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:42,340
this is Ted Anderson. I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who

927
01:22:42,340 --> 01:22:49,620
purchases this book. Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today. It's critical that the

928
01:22:49,620 --> 01:22:56,960
public be made aware of the system. Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237. That's

929
01:22:56,960 --> 01:23:03,820
1-800-686-2237. Hey there. Frank Bates here. Have you heard

930
01:23:03,820 --> 01:23:09,540
about the weird device that could wipe out 280 million Americans? This is really scary

931
01:23:09,540 --> 01:23:14,740
stuff. Defense experts warn that this odd device poses the gravest threat we've ever

932
01:23:14,740 --> 01:23:19,420
known. In fact, just a few weeks ago, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich wrote an

933
01:23:19,420 --> 01:23:24,100
op-ed piece for the Washington Post warning about this deadly threat. I can't believe

934
01:23:24,100 --> 01:23:28,460
that more people aren't talking about this. It may be because the liberals and the government

935
01:23:28,460 --> 01:23:34,560
are trying to cover it up. That's why my friend just created a free video at weirddevice.com

936
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:39,660
that exposes this threat and blows the doors off the conspiracy. Go watch the shocking

937
01:23:39,660 --> 01:23:45,620
video at weirddevice.com right now to discover exactly what it is, plus discover the number

938
01:23:45,620 --> 01:23:50,620
one way you and your family can survive this deadly attack. I'm not sure how long this

939
01:23:50,620 --> 01:24:05,900
video will be online, so go to weirddevice.com before it's gone forever. Again, that's

940
01:24:05,900 --> 01:24:24,660
all

941
01:24:24,660 --> 01:24:30,760
All right, Rosa Corey is one of these guests where I just find it so hard to shut up because

942
01:24:30,760 --> 01:24:33,120
everything she's saying is true.

943
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:38,240
Everything she talks about gives me flashbacks of 16 years, 17 on air.

944
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:40,560
But listeners were like, have you seen these UN documents?

945
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:43,320
Have you seen the Rio meeting four or five years ago?

946
01:24:43,320 --> 01:24:53,600
This is in 1996 or so, 1997, cuz they just had the Rio meeting in 1992.

947
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:57,680
And so I've been on this forever, and then I know how criminal it is.

948
01:24:57,680 --> 01:25:01,280
I'm not up here with rhetoric, okay, calling them criminals.

949
01:25:01,280 --> 01:25:07,840
It's diabolical mafia takeover through zoning, through government, all selectively enforced.

950
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:10,320
Let's go back now to Rosa Corey.

951
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:14,760
Rosa, we were getting into these new compact coffin apartments.

952
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:18,200
Continue, this is a short segment breaking down what we're facing.

953
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:20,160
Great, well, this stuff sounds great.

954
01:25:20,160 --> 01:25:23,160
If it didn't sound so good, we wouldn't be falling for it.

955
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:27,960
I mean, who doesn't want walkable, bikeable transit neighborhoods, you know?

956
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:33,280
Sounds so great, but smart growth is the hardscape for your future poverty.

957
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:38,440
It is for a failed economy and a loss of private property that they're designing these small

958
01:25:38,440 --> 01:25:44,960
apartments stacked in the center of your town so that you supposedly don't need a vehicle.

959
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:49,320
But the fact is that you will only be able to go where that train line that may or may

960
01:25:49,320 --> 01:25:51,520
not exist goes.

961
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:58,760
But the idea is that you will be restricted to city centers, mega-regions, mega-cities,

962
01:25:58,760 --> 01:26:03,440
and you will not be able to get out into the rural and suburban areas.

963
01:26:03,440 --> 01:26:09,320
This plan is about bringing people out of rural and suburban areas into city centers

964
01:26:09,320 --> 01:26:14,200
where they can be more easily controlled, monitored, and surveilled.

965
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:17,400
That is what this is about, more eyes on the street.

966
01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:20,320
Community-oriented policing is Department of Justice.

967
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:26,240
This is about creating more crime, calling it community crime, and then being able to

968
01:26:26,240 --> 01:26:27,600
jail more people.

969
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:29,760
Those prisons are public-private partnership.

970
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:36,200
So this is what we're looking at, is a combination of non-profits, corporations, and government.

971
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:40,240
This is how government has taken over.

972
01:26:40,240 --> 01:26:44,400
And again, right here where I live in Austin, they now have TSA checkpoints downtown and

973
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:48,160
at the train, and they admit, you're not going to have the money to have a car.

974
01:26:48,160 --> 01:26:52,320
You're going to be on a bike or in these compact cities, and guess what they're doing out in

975
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:53,840
Elgin and other areas?

976
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:58,840
They're going to use federal taxpayer money to build 10-story high-rises in the country,

977
01:26:58,840 --> 01:27:03,200
make everybody move into them, and they say they'll then be a factory off the back like

978
01:27:03,200 --> 01:27:04,200
China.

979
01:27:04,200 --> 01:27:05,840
Yes, it's the Chinese model.

980
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:07,200
That's exactly what it is.

981
01:27:07,200 --> 01:27:09,480
With the suicide nets, I guess.

982
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:15,080
And you know, the Walton Family Foundation, the Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation,

983
01:27:15,080 --> 01:27:21,440
many huge foundations are funding non-profits that then pressure your government and partner

984
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:23,280
with corporations to make this happen.

985
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:26,080
This is what it's about, but we have power.

986
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:31,640
The people have power, and we can stop it, but we need to work together.

987
01:27:31,640 --> 01:27:36,400
And by the way, for those that don't know, the globalist Al Bragg, China is the model,

988
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:40,760
and it's an anti-human system, not meant to build up a civilization, meant to destroy

989
01:27:40,760 --> 01:27:42,600
it, to reduce population.

990
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:46,280
It's not that, oh, there's horrible labor in China before they get built up, like our

991
01:27:46,280 --> 01:27:51,600
industrial revolution 150 years ago, the globalist didn't get to fully take over.

992
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:55,600
The robber barons got beaten back in the 20s and 30s and 40s and 50s.

993
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:57,800
This is their massive counter-strike.

994
01:27:57,800 --> 01:27:58,800
This is their move.

995
01:27:58,800 --> 01:27:59,800
Mm-hmm, that's right.

996
01:27:59,800 --> 01:28:04,560
You know, this is, if you look at who the large corporations are behind this, some of

997
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:09,280
them, like Siemens and IBM, are a continuation of the Nazi plan.

998
01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:15,680
This is exactly what we're looking at, control, management of information, and restriction

999
01:28:15,680 --> 01:28:22,240
on your use of land, water, and minerals, and every aspect of human life is going to

1000
01:28:22,240 --> 01:28:26,720
be controlled, and it is in the process right now.

1001
01:28:26,720 --> 01:28:30,440
And by the way, they talk about once all the robotics is fully in and they have robots

1002
01:28:30,440 --> 01:28:34,320
fixing the robots, which they're almost done with, a bunch of big tech companies see the

1003
01:28:34,320 --> 01:28:38,420
ads on CNN bragging, soon robots will fix the robots that fix the robots.

1004
01:28:38,420 --> 01:28:40,360
They won't put suicide nets up anymore.

1005
01:28:40,360 --> 01:28:42,600
They'll tell you, go right on up and jump off.

1006
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:44,660
We have so little value.

1007
01:28:44,660 --> 01:28:50,720
And the pig demon, Al Gore, the fake liberal, he's the guy on the board of Apple who's made

1008
01:28:50,720 --> 01:28:53,920
sure they don't pay people a living wage in China.

1009
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:55,480
I mean, what a monster.

1010
01:28:55,480 --> 01:28:56,480
Mm-hmm.

1011
01:28:56,480 --> 01:29:00,600
Yeah, you know, if you take a look at what the largest job growth, what the largest industry

1012
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:06,080
growth is over the next 20 years projected, it's retinal scanning and imaging machines,

1013
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:12,200
secure data storage, satellite imaging, and of course, social networking, so none of your

1014
01:29:12,200 --> 01:29:15,520
information is private.

1015
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:16,520
It's just incredible.

1016
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:20,860
And I think about the Foxconn workers for Apple and just the devastating things they've

1017
01:29:20,860 --> 01:29:21,860
gone through.

1018
01:29:21,860 --> 01:29:27,400
I've got an image up for TV viewers of these innocent young people, I mean, total slaves,

1019
01:29:27,400 --> 01:29:32,360
absolute total slaves, and look how skinny they are, but it shows how powerful humans

1020
01:29:32,360 --> 01:29:33,360
are.

1021
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:36,800
They're pretty darn healthy despite the horrible, and they still have their human dignity.

1022
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:40,240
They have pretty makeup on and stuff, the girls do, but they live in these facilities.

1023
01:29:40,240 --> 01:29:43,560
They have forced abortions inside.

1024
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:44,560
That's on record.

1025
01:29:44,560 --> 01:29:46,440
They do a scan every month.

1026
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:48,280
These people, these poor people, pray for them, folks.

1027
01:29:48,280 --> 01:29:50,960
We'll be right back with Rosa Corey.

1028
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:52,240
We're on the march.

1029
01:29:52,240 --> 01:29:54,640
The empire's on the run.

1030
01:29:54,640 --> 01:30:01,760
Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

1031
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:06,440
Coming back on 2012, I know personally I'm thanking God that my family and I made it

1032
01:30:06,440 --> 01:30:07,440
through the year.

1033
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:11,160
From natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the

1034
01:30:11,160 --> 01:30:15,320
family hardships brought on by a disastrous economy, our hearts go out to those that have

1035
01:30:15,320 --> 01:30:16,320
lost everything.

1036
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:20,600
My friends at eFoods Direct hear from customers every day that are fortunate to weather life's

1037
01:30:20,600 --> 01:30:22,760
storm by having a supply of food on hand.

1038
01:30:22,760 --> 01:30:27,200
Danny from New York City wrote in following Hurricane Sandy and said, almost all the grocery

1039
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:31,200
stores are closed, but I managed to get my eFoods just in time to be able to help my

1040
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:32,200
sister and my niece.

1041
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:36,440
Bottom line, it's better to be prepared 10 years too early than one day too late.

1042
01:30:36,440 --> 01:30:39,080
Heed common sense's warning and do what I've done.

Alex Jones here with a very important announcement for Truth Speakers.

1050
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:09,400
We've carried a lot of amazing films and books over the years on the online video bookstore

1051
01:31:09,400 --> 01:31:10,400
at Infowars.com.

1052
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:16,400
And out of all the titles we've carried, one stands out because it is just so chillingly

1053
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:23,200
convincing and that's Dreams From My Real Father by Joel Gilbert, available at Infowars.com.

1054
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:26,800
This film exposes the fraud that Obama is like nothing I've seen.

1055
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:30,940
If you want to know who Obama's real daddy is, this is the film for you.

1058
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:41,760
None Dare Call a Conspiracy by Gary Allen, the book that woke me up.

1059
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:46,240
We're also carrying Behind the Green Mask, UN Agenda 21 by Rosa Corey.

1060
01:31:46,240 --> 01:31:49,120
This book is coffin nails to the globalist takeover.

1061
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:54,000
The Greater Good, the most professional and up-to-date film I've ever seen, exposing the

1062
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,040
scourge that is vaccines.

1063
01:31:56,040 --> 01:32:01,320
These titles and a lot more are all available at Infowarshop.com.

You've got a business, you didn't build that.

1077
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:21,720
Somebody else made that happen.

1078
01:33:21,720 --> 01:33:31,920
Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.

1079
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:35,520
Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to go back to Rosa Corey here in just a moment.

1080
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:38,560
I'm going to give the number out if you've got questions or comments for her, she'll

1081
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:43,160
be with us till about five after next hour, then we've got our next guest in studio.

1082
01:33:43,160 --> 01:33:50,120
The toll free number to join us is 800-259-9231, first time callers on this Friday.

1083
01:33:50,120 --> 01:33:53,920
Your questions or your statements on agenda 21.

1084
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:57,240
And this is global governance, it's all under UNESCO.

1085
01:33:57,240 --> 01:34:02,480
That's why it's global standardized training on every front, on every issue, social, cultural,

1086
01:34:02,480 --> 01:34:05,640
religious, economic, it's so diabolical.

1087
01:34:05,640 --> 01:34:10,440
Now again, the book behind the green mask, UN agenda 21 is available, the lowest price

1088
01:34:10,440 --> 01:34:16,000
you're going to find anywhere matching her price at Infowarsstore.com and your purchase

1089
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:17,560
supports our work.

1090
01:34:17,560 --> 01:34:23,560
You ought to buy these by the cases and give them to city planners and others to identify

1091
01:34:23,560 --> 01:34:28,440
if they're a conscious operative or a lot of them read it and wake up and resist and

1092
01:34:28,440 --> 01:34:29,760
Rosa can talk about that.

1093
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:36,520
So the good news is, this is so diabolical and so on record that if we just expose them

1094
01:34:36,520 --> 01:34:40,280
and resist them, we're beating them all over the place and that's why they are screaming

1095
01:34:40,280 --> 01:34:41,280
bloody murder.

1096
01:34:41,280 --> 01:34:44,760
A year ago they said this didn't exist, now they're going, of course it exists, it's good

1097
01:34:44,760 --> 01:34:48,440
and you people are stopping us, we're gonna be talking about that in a moment.

1098
01:34:48,440 --> 01:34:55,240
Now the new issue, the February issue of Infowars magazine is out, the hard copy, 60 page big

1099
01:34:55,240 --> 01:35:02,680
color glossy with an image of the 50 states forming a gun, why the tyrants want your guns.

1100
01:35:02,680 --> 01:35:07,280
And this is guaranteed to sell out, sometimes the magazine sells out in four or five days.

1101
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:11,720
We put 70,000 on the streets in Texas and sell 30,000, we hold back some.

1102
01:35:11,720 --> 01:35:16,080
You can either buy them in bulk in groups of 10 up to 100 at cost or get a one year

1103
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:18,040
subscription.

1104
01:35:18,040 --> 01:35:24,920
And when you get the one year subscription while supplies last, we are also able to then

1105
01:35:24,920 --> 01:35:28,240
generally put in the last issue, a few that we hold back.

1106
01:35:28,240 --> 01:35:33,320
So you can subscribe at infowarsstore.com or you can buy them in bulk while supplies

1107
01:35:33,320 --> 01:35:45,880
last at infowarsstore.com or you can call toll free 888-253-3139, again that's 888-253-3139.

1108
01:35:45,880 --> 01:35:50,880
An amazing magazine, people are blown away by it and it's a pamphlet, it's a 60 page

1109
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:58,480
color pamphlet that you can buy at cost to give to people to wake them up, it is an info

1110
01:35:58,480 --> 01:35:59,480
war.

1111
01:35:59,480 --> 01:36:09,240
And finally, four years ago, we sold the Obama Joker socialism shirt.

1112
01:36:09,240 --> 01:36:13,160
Really it's fascism, so we had both variants, but we only sold it for about a year and then

1113
01:36:13,160 --> 01:36:16,960
I said I'm never gonna sell it again, we may sell a different design later.

1114
01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:23,120
Our great graphics designer Janee Meadows, she put together the Obama Tyrant shirt that

1115
01:36:23,120 --> 01:36:26,080
I'm holding here in my hands.

1116
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:30,000
And it is Obama the Joker and it says Tyrant, infowars.com.

1117
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:35,440
When people then ask you what it's about, it's a great conversation piece to wake them

1118
01:36:35,440 --> 01:36:36,440
up.

1119
01:36:36,440 --> 01:36:40,800
And on the back, we've taken our most popular t-shirt ever and put that on the back, infowars.com.

1120
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:45,500
An AK-47 with the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed on the back and the

1121
01:36:45,500 --> 01:36:47,520
words come and take it.

1122
01:36:47,520 --> 01:36:51,320
So I think this is gonna end up being the best t-shirt most popular ever and that's

1123
01:36:51,320 --> 01:36:54,800
how we fund our news operation and everything here and fight these globalists.

1124
01:36:54,800 --> 01:37:00,200
Now, before I go back to Rosa, I wanna say this about guns.

1125
01:37:00,200 --> 01:37:05,120
The NRA, I saw a statement they put out yesterday and in the past they were like, yeah, we think

1126
01:37:05,120 --> 01:37:07,980
there should be background checks for everybody.

1127
01:37:07,980 --> 01:37:10,400
Get rid of private sales even to your neighbor of a gun.

1128
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:13,640
And they were asked, why have you changed and said you're not against private sales

1129
01:37:13,640 --> 01:37:14,640
now?

1130
01:37:14,640 --> 01:37:18,320
Because the system doesn't work, criminals will still have guns.

1131
01:37:18,320 --> 01:37:21,200
Well, let me take that one further and then we're gonna go to our guest.

1132
01:37:21,200 --> 01:37:23,880
Let me take that one further.

1133
01:37:23,880 --> 01:37:25,400
We don't trust the system.

1134
01:37:25,400 --> 01:37:29,760
Yeah, it sounds reasonable to have a mental background check and a bunch of background

1135
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:31,320
checks to get a gun.

1136
01:37:31,320 --> 01:37:35,280
And if angels were running things, the good angels, then I would be for it.

1137
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:39,380
The globalists have taken the guns everywhere in the world while they arm against us, they

1138
01:37:39,380 --> 01:37:40,640
are taking our guns.

1139
01:37:40,640 --> 01:37:45,240
Australia took all the semi-autos, now they're taking the bolt action.

1140
01:37:45,240 --> 01:37:46,920
It's happened everywhere.

1141
01:37:46,920 --> 01:37:50,480
These globalists are on record saying they're going to have the abolition of our guns.

1142
01:37:50,480 --> 01:37:54,100
The UN is on record while they engage in atrocities worldwide.

1143
01:37:54,100 --> 01:37:55,100
It's the same thing.

1144
01:37:55,100 --> 01:37:56,400
I like bike lanes.

1145
01:37:56,400 --> 01:38:04,040
I like a city ordinance saying you get a tax discount if you put a garden on your roof.

1146
01:38:04,040 --> 01:38:06,520
I like things like that.

1147
01:38:06,520 --> 01:38:12,120
The problem is they take all this good stuff and make it global and selectively enforce

1148
01:38:12,120 --> 01:38:13,120
it.

1149
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:16,080
And that's just the window dressing for all the bad stuff that goes on.

1150
01:38:16,080 --> 01:38:18,920
I wanna give her the floor for about ten minutes before we go to calls.

1151
01:38:18,920 --> 01:38:21,960
I'll have to stick a sock in my mouth cuz information is so important because I know

1152
01:38:21,960 --> 01:38:22,960
it's real.

1153
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:23,960
I know it's a criminal takeover.

1154
01:38:23,960 --> 01:38:29,760
It's like if I saw a guy robbing my neighbors, I'd be like going, hey, Bob, somebody's in

1155
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:31,600
your garage.

1156
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:34,280
But this is our liberty, our freedom, our economy.

1157
01:38:34,280 --> 01:38:35,520
They wanna wreck it.

1158
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:38,040
They're on record wanting to wreck it.

1159
01:38:38,040 --> 01:38:41,640
And it's not that environmental stuff isn't reasonable.

1160
01:38:41,640 --> 01:38:44,880
That's the sugar coating on the cyanide pill to make it taste good.

1161
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:48,840
You can give somebody Kool-Aid, Jim Jones, but it had cyanide in it.

1162
01:38:48,840 --> 01:38:51,100
Tastes like grape Kool-Aid gonna kill you better than a hammer.

1163
01:38:51,100 --> 01:38:52,680
Tastes real good like antifreeze.

1164
01:38:52,680 --> 01:38:53,680
It tastes good.

1165
01:38:53,680 --> 01:38:54,840
It'll kill you.

1166
01:38:54,840 --> 01:38:58,360
And that's what's frustrating is that they all wanna sound reasonable and they want us

1167
01:38:58,360 --> 01:39:02,000
to sit back and be nice and debate with them in a false paradigm.

1168
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:06,000
No, it's time to get aggressive to shake people out of their trance.

1169
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:10,920
That's why they're now admitting Piers Morgan was a defeat when I blew up.

1170
01:39:10,920 --> 01:39:14,080
For him, they're now admitting, this is the way to get.

1171
01:39:14,080 --> 01:39:15,400
Being aggressive does work.

1172
01:39:15,400 --> 01:39:16,560
Of course it works.

1173
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:18,140
They're aggressive.

1174
01:39:18,140 --> 01:39:19,320
Get aggressive or get overrun.

1175
01:39:19,320 --> 01:39:22,720
Now, Rosa, I'm gonna shut up for ten minutes, then we're gonna take a few calls for you.

1176
01:39:22,720 --> 01:39:28,880
But break down, again, the latest on what they're doing, our victories, how we beat

1177
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:30,200
them, where you see this going.

1178
01:39:30,200 --> 01:39:31,200
Rosa Corey.

1179
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:35,280
Well, you know, first of all, I wanna make sure that people know this is the hijacking

1180
01:39:35,280 --> 01:39:36,560
of the environmental movement.

1181
01:39:36,560 --> 01:39:40,920
That's why I called my book Behind the Green Mask, because if it didn't look good

1182
01:39:40,920 --> 01:39:43,920
and sound good, then we wouldn't be going for it.

1183
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:49,440
So there is a political and social ideology that goes, you know, that's sort of overarching

1184
01:39:49,440 --> 01:39:52,280
on this, and it's communitarianism.

1185
01:39:52,280 --> 01:39:55,360
And Dan Jones just called Obama a communitarian.

1186
01:39:55,360 --> 01:40:02,040
He said that we've gone way too far in the individualistic direction, and we have to

1187
01:40:02,040 --> 01:40:06,240
pull it back to rebalance towards communitarianism.

1188
01:40:06,240 --> 01:40:12,160
And what that means is that your individual rights are balanced with the so-called community,

1189
01:40:12,160 --> 01:40:14,600
and the community can change at any time.

1190
01:40:14,600 --> 01:40:22,120
What this is about is about taking away your right to privacy, to your freedom, to live

1191
01:40:22,120 --> 01:40:27,280
where you wish, to move freely, and to instate instead the power of the community.

1192
01:40:27,280 --> 01:40:33,600
So this is why it's about consensus and the Delphi technique, where you get invited

1193
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:38,880
to give your opinion on a new plan in the center of your town, but if you don't agree

1194
01:40:38,880 --> 01:40:43,000
with what the direction of that plan is, what the goal is, then you're considered to be

1195
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,840
fringe, and you are ignored.

1196
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:47,320
And that's what this is all about.

1197
01:40:47,320 --> 01:40:52,840
It's about artificial consensus and giving the illusion of community buy-in.

1198
01:40:52,840 --> 01:40:58,680
So that's why I say awareness is the first step in the resistance, because people need

1199
01:40:58,680 --> 01:41:03,800
to educate themselves about what this looks like in their town, because you're going

1200
01:41:03,800 --> 01:41:06,040
to see it called many different things.

1201
01:41:06,040 --> 01:41:11,760
Your smart meters, you might see it as the international codes, you'll see it as whatever

1202
01:41:11,760 --> 01:41:17,320
that plan is called, Vision 2025, or One Valley, One Vision, or whatever they're calling

1203
01:41:17,320 --> 01:41:18,320
it in your town.

1204
01:41:18,320 --> 01:41:27,120
It's the same plan all across the world, and Agenda 21 is the action plan to inventory

1205
01:41:27,120 --> 01:41:35,920
and control all land, water, minerals, plants, animals, means of construction, education,

1206
01:41:35,920 --> 01:41:40,680
energy, and information, and human beings in the world.

1207
01:41:40,680 --> 01:41:42,720
That's what this plan is about.

1208
01:41:42,720 --> 01:41:45,240
Now, we have a chance to fight this.

1209
01:41:45,240 --> 01:41:51,680
I believe that 2013 is the year of critical awareness all over the world, and we are really

1210
01:41:51,680 --> 01:41:52,680
breaking through.

1211
01:41:52,680 --> 01:41:58,200
This is the year where people are understanding that this is a global, regional neighborhood

1212
01:41:58,200 --> 01:41:59,200
plan.

1213
01:41:59,200 --> 01:42:03,640
It's global, designed to look like it's coming up from the grassroots, and it is not.

1214
01:42:03,640 --> 01:42:05,280
So it's up to us.

1215
01:42:05,280 --> 01:42:08,360
There's no heroes, nobody on the sidelines here.

1216
01:42:08,360 --> 01:42:12,480
You know, we've got to get out there and expose these public-private partnerships in

1217
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:14,800
our local communities and our towns.

1218
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:19,520
We want to educate our local officials and let them know that we will support them if

1219
01:42:19,520 --> 01:42:25,720
they refuse to take federal grants for partnership for sustainable community grants.

1220
01:42:25,720 --> 01:42:30,480
We will support them, but if they don't, if they don't listen to us, we will take

1221
01:42:30,480 --> 01:42:31,720
them out.

1222
01:42:31,720 --> 01:42:34,000
We need to recognize that we have power.

1223
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:38,800
So what we're doing is we are getting active in the resistance.

1224
01:42:38,800 --> 01:42:42,000
We're understanding that you don't wait until it gets violent.

1225
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,600
You want to call a halt to it while you can.

1226
01:42:44,600 --> 01:42:47,320
So you want to stop redevelopment projects.

1227
01:42:47,320 --> 01:42:53,580
This is so-called urban renewal, which actually directs you into city centers.

1228
01:42:53,580 --> 01:42:57,720
You want to stop them from pulverizing your rural roads to gravel.

1229
01:42:57,720 --> 01:43:02,600
You want to get out there and protect those farmers that are out there being restricted

1230
01:43:02,600 --> 01:43:04,160
and regulated to death.

1231
01:43:04,160 --> 01:43:08,920
They're putting monitoring on wells, private wells.

1232
01:43:08,920 --> 01:43:13,000
What is happening with your government is that you are looking at treason.

1233
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:17,800
Treason is happening in every town all across the world.

1234
01:43:17,800 --> 01:43:20,720
There are people who think that they're doing the right thing.

1235
01:43:20,720 --> 01:43:26,040
It's up to us as the informed electorate to let our elected officials know that they

1236
01:43:26,040 --> 01:43:32,280
are committing treason, and treason has no statute of limitations.

1237
01:43:32,280 --> 01:43:36,960
There is no statute of limitations, so these people will be held to account.

1238
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:38,640
And this is our job.

1239
01:43:38,640 --> 01:43:41,360
There are way more of us than there are of them.

1240
01:43:41,360 --> 01:43:48,040
And we need to expose collaborators, speak out, anti-Delphi these meetings, and work

1241
01:43:48,040 --> 01:43:53,800
together to break that left-right paradigm, because that terrifies those who are in power.

1242
01:43:53,800 --> 01:43:54,800
And we can do it.

1243
01:43:54,800 --> 01:43:57,280
We are doing it all over the world.

1244
01:43:57,280 --> 01:43:59,760
I'll actually be in Texas in March.

1245
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:04,640
I'm traveling all across the country speaking out, and people are joining me.

1246
01:44:04,640 --> 01:44:05,920
This is tremendous.

1247
01:44:05,920 --> 01:44:09,580
We are really getting movement across the world.

1248
01:44:09,580 --> 01:44:13,560
And by the way, the globalists operate like we don't read their own websites and white

1249
01:44:13,560 --> 01:44:14,560
papers.

1250
01:44:14,560 --> 01:44:15,560
Talk about their panic button.

1251
01:44:15,560 --> 01:44:20,400
They're not just freaking out in the Washington Post, New York Times, admitting we're fighting

1252
01:44:20,400 --> 01:44:21,400
them globally.

1253
01:44:21,400 --> 01:44:25,040
They are panicking in their own white papers right now.

1254
01:44:25,040 --> 01:44:26,040
What's hurting them the worst?

1255
01:44:26,040 --> 01:44:31,360
I mean, I guess just exposure, people go to the meetings, no one's allowed to even talk.

1256
01:44:31,360 --> 01:44:35,920
They just tell you what to believe, or even if you do, they then certify it.

1257
01:44:35,920 --> 01:44:38,120
I mean, people understand what's happening here.

1258
01:44:38,120 --> 01:44:44,280
Well, you know, we have a series of videos online called Near Riot at Delphi meetings,

1259
01:44:44,280 --> 01:44:45,960
which are really great.

1260
01:44:45,960 --> 01:44:50,760
And the thing is that people now are beginning to recognize what it looks like, because they've

1261
01:44:50,760 --> 01:44:56,120
been told, you know, these controlled opposition people will tell you not to talk about Agenda

1262
01:44:56,120 --> 01:44:57,120
21.

1263
01:44:57,120 --> 01:45:01,640
And, you know, you're being directed by people who are infiltrating your...

1264
01:45:01,640 --> 01:45:02,640
Exactly.

1265
01:45:02,640 --> 01:45:07,680
They'll say it's discrediting to talk about Agenda 21 and the UN biological diversity

1266
01:45:07,680 --> 01:45:08,680
assessments.

1267
01:45:08,680 --> 01:45:10,260
It's just, don't do that.

1268
01:45:10,260 --> 01:45:12,120
That is how they're controlling people.

1269
01:45:12,120 --> 01:45:15,240
Yeah, that's what controlled opposition looks like.

1270
01:45:15,240 --> 01:45:20,640
So you need to show up and occupy those government meetings and talk about Agenda 21 sustainable

1271
01:45:20,640 --> 01:45:21,640
development.

1272
01:45:21,640 --> 01:45:23,960
Let them know that you know what it is.

1273
01:45:23,960 --> 01:45:29,600
Those three pillars of Agenda 21 are economy, ecology, and social equity.

1274
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:34,240
And when you see that together, you want to break that down, and you want to advise your

1275
01:45:34,240 --> 01:45:39,160
elected officials that you are going to take them out if they don't drop this out.

1276
01:45:39,160 --> 01:45:47,400
You've got to remove yourself from this, what it is, is money coming from the federal government

1277
01:45:47,400 --> 01:45:49,160
that is funding these plants.

1278
01:45:49,160 --> 01:45:52,800
And then that money is coming from corporations and nonprofits.

1279
01:45:52,800 --> 01:45:57,760
So what you want to do is break that cycle and refuse to participate.

1280
01:45:57,760 --> 01:45:58,760
You want to be the resistance.

1281
01:45:58,760 --> 01:45:59,760
That's right.

1282
01:45:59,760 --> 01:46:00,760
That's right.

1283
01:46:00,760 --> 01:46:04,220
All the big mega corporations, they put tiny seed money in to get the politicians.

1284
01:46:04,220 --> 01:46:08,520
They conduit federal HUD money and others just like Acorn, but in a hundred other groups

1285
01:46:08,520 --> 01:46:14,840
plus back to them to then let them take over the local government, take over the infrastructure,

1286
01:46:14,840 --> 01:46:20,640
and then have their buildings subsidized and go tax-free while not letting you fix your

1287
01:46:20,640 --> 01:46:21,640
roof.

1288
01:46:21,640 --> 01:46:22,640
You know, that's right.

1289
01:46:22,640 --> 01:46:26,960
And it's not only, hey, it's not only in land use, we're talking about education with a

1290
01:46:26,960 --> 01:46:33,120
common core standards where teachers no longer can teach, where students are being restricted.

1291
01:46:33,120 --> 01:46:37,720
I'm sure, Alex, you know about those little kids, the 60-year-olds who got suspended from

1292
01:46:37,720 --> 01:46:40,640
school for using their fingers like guns and saying, dang, dang.

1293
01:46:40,640 --> 01:46:42,800
It's total Soviet mind control.

1294
01:46:42,800 --> 01:46:43,800
Right.

1295
01:46:43,800 --> 01:46:49,840
So what we're talking about is actually social engineering and restricting human beings so

1296
01:46:49,840 --> 01:46:53,080
that they literally don't know what is right and what is wrong.

1297
01:46:53,080 --> 01:46:55,160
And this is how you break down a society.

1298
01:46:55,160 --> 01:46:57,160
We want to talk about a hostile takeover.

1299
01:46:57,160 --> 01:46:58,760
That's what this is.

1300
01:46:58,760 --> 01:47:04,200
The authoritarians, I've read countless books, Bernays and others, they say we tell them

1301
01:47:04,200 --> 01:47:06,260
ridiculous things are bad.

1302
01:47:06,260 --> 01:47:08,600
We tell them common sense things are bad.

1303
01:47:08,600 --> 01:47:13,000
We tell them good things are bad so they feel guilty and off balance and will do whatever

1304
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:14,040
we say.

1305
01:47:14,040 --> 01:47:16,640
They're giving them a guilt complex.

1306
01:47:16,640 --> 01:47:17,840
And again, the teachers don't know.

1307
01:47:17,840 --> 01:47:23,360
They're just given the programming, the handbooks, it is meant to prepare children to believe

1308
01:47:23,360 --> 01:47:24,360
they're criminals.

1309
01:47:24,360 --> 01:47:25,680
It is pure evil.

1310
01:47:25,680 --> 01:47:26,680
That's right.

1311
01:47:26,680 --> 01:47:29,640
We need to refuse to participate.

1312
01:47:29,640 --> 01:47:37,600
Refuse to give your personal information, refuse to collaborate, refuse to pay nonprofits,

1313
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:40,420
refuse to give donations and refuse to volunteer.

1314
01:47:40,420 --> 01:47:42,580
If you're a teacher, refuse.

1315
01:47:42,580 --> 01:47:44,200
We need to do this together.

1316
01:47:44,200 --> 01:47:46,440
There are so many of us who are becoming aware.

1317
01:47:46,440 --> 01:47:52,040
We need to stand tall, stand together and refuse this indoctrination that we're getting.

1318
01:47:52,040 --> 01:47:54,040
How freaked out is the enemy right now?

1319
01:47:54,040 --> 01:47:55,720
They are so freaked out.

1320
01:47:55,720 --> 01:47:56,720
It's incredible.

1321
01:47:56,720 --> 01:48:00,840
They were thinking they were going to pull this off and be able to, they're in the end

1322
01:48:00,840 --> 01:48:01,840
game.

1323
01:48:01,840 --> 01:48:02,840
But you know what?

1324
01:48:02,840 --> 01:48:07,240
We are giving them a run for their money and we will prevail because this is not going

1325
01:48:07,240 --> 01:48:08,240
to fly.

1326
01:48:08,240 --> 01:48:13,200
People are not willing to allow their entire culture to be destroyed in order to be moved

1327
01:48:13,200 --> 01:48:16,160
into these mega units and centers of cities.

1328
01:48:16,160 --> 01:48:21,560
You know, your town, whatever your little town is, that is a collector feeder town and

1329
01:48:21,560 --> 01:48:25,240
that will be closed down and you'll be moved into the huge city.

1330
01:48:25,240 --> 01:48:27,600
Take a look at mega regions on our website.

1331
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:29,280
This is a project.

1332
01:48:29,280 --> 01:48:30,840
Oh, they've openly announced it.

1333
01:48:30,840 --> 01:48:34,880
I'm in this particular mega region and they admit that you're not going to live in these

1334
01:48:34,880 --> 01:48:37,420
little towns unless you have special permits.

1335
01:48:37,420 --> 01:48:41,280
It's all under the original UN maps where half the country's off limits.

1336
01:48:41,280 --> 01:48:43,600
I mean, this is so diabolical.

1337
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:44,720
It's true, but you know what?

1338
01:48:44,720 --> 01:48:46,320
We do have them on the run.

1339
01:48:46,320 --> 01:48:50,240
When you start seeing this, you know, they're vilifying me in the press.

1340
01:48:50,240 --> 01:48:51,640
That's when I know I'm winning.

1341
01:48:51,640 --> 01:48:56,160
When they're actually out there talking about this and they're saying, oh, that agenda 21,

1342
01:48:56,160 --> 01:48:57,160
that's a good thing.

1343
01:48:57,160 --> 01:49:01,920
When they wouldn't even admit that it existed for 20 years, you know, then you know you're

1344
01:49:01,920 --> 01:49:02,920
winning.

1345
01:49:02,920 --> 01:49:03,920
We are out there.

1346
01:49:03,920 --> 01:49:07,760
We are bringing up the troops and nobody is going to be left behind.

1347
01:49:07,760 --> 01:49:09,980
Nobody on the sidelines, no heroes.

1348
01:49:09,980 --> 01:49:10,980
We all work together.

1349
01:49:10,980 --> 01:49:11,980
That's another reason.

1350
01:49:11,980 --> 01:49:12,980
You know what?

1351
01:49:12,980 --> 01:49:17,680
My book is a great opportunity for you to get up to speed on this quickly and we've

1352
01:49:17,680 --> 01:49:20,520
got 20 pages in the back on what you can do.

1353
01:49:20,520 --> 01:49:24,560
So you want to educate yourself and others as quickly as you can.

1354
01:49:24,560 --> 01:49:25,560
Absolutely.

1355
01:49:25,560 --> 01:49:30,260
I want to come back and take two short segments of calls and we have a pastor, Steven Anderson

1356
01:49:30,260 --> 01:49:34,600
in here talking about the police state in a new film and a lot more, but Rosa Corry

1357
01:49:34,600 --> 01:49:39,680
is our guest, author of Behind the Green Mask, available at Infowarsstore.com or by calling

1358
01:49:39,680 --> 01:49:40,680
888-253-3139.

1359
01:49:40,680 --> 01:49:45,280
We're about to go to break in about a minute.

1360
01:49:45,280 --> 01:49:47,840
Any other key points you want to relay to people right now?

1361
01:49:47,840 --> 01:49:48,840
Yeah.

1362
01:49:48,840 --> 01:49:51,720
You know, this plan is predicated on sharing information.

1363
01:49:51,720 --> 01:49:53,580
That's part of agenda 21.

1364
01:49:53,580 --> 01:49:55,600
It's all about sharing our info through technology.

1365
01:49:55,600 --> 01:49:57,080
This is a technocracy.

1366
01:49:57,080 --> 01:49:58,080
It is.

1367
01:49:58,080 --> 01:50:00,880
So every part of your life is being shared.

1368
01:50:00,880 --> 01:50:02,720
You have no personal privacy.

1369
01:50:02,720 --> 01:50:06,360
You need to break that paradigm and refuse to cooperate.

1370
01:50:06,360 --> 01:50:10,200
That's why they want you in the mega-opolises with the face-scanning cameras, the controls

1371
01:50:10,200 --> 01:50:15,960
where they can turn the taxes up to bankrupt anybody they want and literally render you

1372
01:50:15,960 --> 01:50:18,320
down to people living in jail cells.

1373
01:50:18,320 --> 01:50:19,320
That's their plan.

1374
01:50:19,320 --> 01:50:23,160
Turn the cities into giant, medium security prison grids.

1375
01:50:23,160 --> 01:50:28,560
I mean, it's while the elite live in the country and are exempt flying there by jet copter.

1376
01:50:28,560 --> 01:50:29,560
That's exactly right.

1377
01:50:29,560 --> 01:50:36,680
This is about controlling populations, restricting ability to move freely and to speak out.

1378
01:50:36,680 --> 01:50:41,980
But they're going to have model, and Austin is it, model megacities where the elite lives

1379
01:50:41,980 --> 01:50:43,840
that are quasi-exempt.

1380
01:50:43,840 --> 01:50:44,840
It's so incredible.

1381
01:50:44,840 --> 01:50:47,160
I mean, these people, it's a science fiction movie, folks.

1382
01:50:47,160 --> 01:50:49,240
You're living in a science fiction movie.

1383
01:50:49,240 --> 01:50:50,600
You've got to read her book.

1384
01:50:50,600 --> 01:50:53,640
You've got to see my film, End Game, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.

1385
01:50:53,640 --> 01:50:56,220
This is a stated on-the-record program.

1386
01:50:56,220 --> 01:50:58,200
These are criminal authoritarians.

1387
01:50:58,200 --> 01:51:01,740
You've got to realize they are your mortal enemies.

1388
01:51:01,740 --> 01:51:06,380
This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.

1389
01:51:06,380 --> 01:51:10,720
Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.

1390
01:51:10,720 --> 01:51:15,360
Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows

1391
01:51:15,360 --> 01:51:16,360
you to have.

1392
01:51:16,360 --> 01:51:17,360
It's true.

1393
01:51:17,360 --> 01:51:22,040
The government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.

1394
01:51:22,040 --> 01:51:26,400
Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.

1395
01:51:26,400 --> 01:51:30,400
And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.

1396
01:51:30,400 --> 01:51:33,880
Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.

1397
01:51:33,880 --> 01:51:37,580
Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.

1398
01:51:37,580 --> 01:51:42,200
Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.

1399
01:51:42,200 --> 01:51:46,120
Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,

1400
01:51:46,120 --> 01:51:47,500
one of my oldest sponsors.

1401
01:51:47,500 --> 01:51:51,760

01:52:03,480 --> 01:52:06,840
And it's an MRE Smorgasbord at longlifefood.com.

1406
01:52:06,840 --> 01:52:11,600
In 1983, Long Life Food Depot was one of the first to sell MRE pouches to the public.

1407
01:52:11,600 --> 01:52:14,280
And we're still selling them almost 30 years later.

1408
01:52:14,280 --> 01:52:18,320
Today, Long Life Food Depot has the world's most complete MRE online buffet.

1409
01:52:18,320 --> 01:52:20,200
Because MREs are all we do.

1410
01:52:20,200 --> 01:52:25,240
Tasty varieties of chicken, beef, salmon, and pasta entrees, plus sandwiches and our

1411
01:52:25,240 --> 01:52:26,640
easy-to-use pouches.

Full moisture, long shelf life, and ready-to-eat hot or cold.

1413
01:52:29,920 --> 01:52:33,240
We sell by the pouch or case, so the choices are endless.

1414
01:52:33,240 --> 01:52:35,560
And so are the graduated quantity discounts.

1415
01:52:35,560 --> 01:52:37,720

1421
01:52:59,800 --> 01:53:04,720
Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the bestselling book, Cancer Step Outside the

1422
01:53:04,720 --> 01:53:05,720
Box.

1423
01:53:05,720 --> 01:53:08,640
I want you to know some very important information.

1424
01:53:08,640 --> 01:53:13,460
In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White

1425
01:53:13,460 --> 01:53:17,800
House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.

1426
01:53:17,800 --> 01:53:23,360
Now 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.

1427
01:53:23,360 --> 01:53:28,420
Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally

1428
01:53:28,420 --> 01:53:33,560
occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single

1429
01:53:33,560 --> 01:53:34,720
normal cell.

1430
01:53:34,720 --> 01:53:38,480
If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune

1431
01:53:38,480 --> 01:53:42,480
cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.

1432
01:53:42,480 --> 01:53:50,400
Call 1-866-VenusFly or order from Carnivora.com, that's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A.com.

1433
01:53:50,400 --> 01:53:57,760
That's 1-866-836-8735, 1-866-VenusFly or visit Carnivora.com.

1434
01:53:57,760 --> 01:54:01,280
Protect your immune system, it's the only one you've got.

1435
01:54:01,280 --> 01:54:12,200
I read part of the Telecommunications Act in 96 and it said by October 1st, 2001, all

1436
01:54:12,200 --> 01:54:17,400
cell phones had to have a trackership in them to track you via satellite triangulation via

1437
01:54:17,400 --> 01:54:21,040
the cell towers and that the government would be able to dial in and listen to your phone

1438
01:54:21,040 --> 01:54:22,040
even when it's off.

1439
01:54:22,040 --> 01:54:28,280
It was all there and that they would start sending you messages onto your phone and it

1440
01:54:28,280 --> 01:54:32,800
described text messages and others, it described smartphones, they're like 30 years ahead of

1441
01:54:32,800 --> 01:54:33,800
us.

1442
01:54:33,800 --> 01:54:39,520
Here's Fox News, text on missing kids startle cell users and this is out of Los Angeles.

1443
01:54:39,520 --> 01:54:43,320
They first tested on the East Coast, now the West Coast, now it's happening in Austin,

1444
01:54:43,320 --> 01:54:45,000
my crew are getting these.

1445
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:48,680
And they say now it's gonna be presidential announcements, your smartphone will break

1446
01:54:48,680 --> 01:54:50,720
in and it'll be Obama.

1447
01:54:50,720 --> 01:54:56,880
I mean, people of Earth, we are the Glaxian Empire, I mean, it's total control.

1448
01:54:56,880 --> 01:55:00,400
The police are being trained to set up checkpoints to take your guns, it's already happening

1449
01:55:00,400 --> 01:55:02,480
to veterans in New York, checkpoints.

1450
01:55:02,480 --> 01:55:07,600
They just randomly pull you over a checkpoint, search your car, 30 round mag, five felonies.

1451
01:55:07,600 --> 01:55:09,960
I mean, they're coming, this is how they're gonna purge us.

1452
01:55:09,960 --> 01:55:13,340
And you're like, well, I'll just turn my guns in, they're still coming.

1453
01:55:13,340 --> 01:55:20,360
These are authoritarians, we're in so much trouble, I just can't believe it's actually

1454
01:55:20,360 --> 01:55:21,800
happening.

1455
01:55:21,800 --> 01:55:26,080
And there are a lot of people that want power, here it is, FEMA implements special chip and

1456
01:55:26,080 --> 01:55:27,920
cell phones to send out alerts.

1457
01:55:27,920 --> 01:55:33,080
I've told people about this 16 years ago, and they looked at me like I was a space alien.

1458
01:55:33,080 --> 01:55:36,480
Ladies and gentlemen, they're running army checkpoints all over the country, they're

1459
01:55:36,480 --> 01:55:41,640
having hardcore army drills everywhere and saying the army's gonna respond to extremists

1460
01:55:41,640 --> 01:55:43,000
now in America.

1461
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:47,720
They're getting ready for the organized collapse where they'll pose as the saviors and try

1462
01:55:47,720 --> 01:55:50,280
to then bring us under their control.

1463
01:55:50,280 --> 01:55:53,240
That's part of the plan, is a stepped process of collapses.

1464
01:55:53,240 --> 01:55:56,640
Rosa Corey, we're gonna take a few calls, but your comment on what I just covered.

1465
01:55:56,640 --> 01:56:03,300
Well, it goes worse than that because there's something called mandatory volunteering.

1466
01:56:03,300 --> 01:56:06,840
And if you haven't caught on to that, it's basically slavery.

1467
01:56:06,840 --> 01:56:12,400
This is the trend where you're going to be expected to do your mandatory volunteering

1468
01:56:12,400 --> 01:56:15,480
if you wanna get anything from the so-called community.

1469
01:56:15,480 --> 01:56:19,400
So we're talking about restrictions on every aspect of your life.

1470
01:56:19,400 --> 01:56:22,840
It's not enough to pay 70% on average if you actually work for the government one way or

1471
01:56:22,840 --> 01:56:23,840
another.

1472
01:56:23,840 --> 01:56:27,960
Well, Rahm Emanuel said you're gonna serve at least two months every year, up to age

1473
01:56:27,960 --> 01:56:28,960
65.

1474
01:56:28,960 --> 01:56:29,960
Yeah, that's right.

1475
01:56:29,960 --> 01:56:32,960
Lifelong learning and participation in your community.

1476
01:56:32,960 --> 01:56:33,960
Which means brainwashing.

1477
01:56:33,960 --> 01:56:34,960
Giving back.

1478
01:56:34,960 --> 01:56:35,960
Giving back.

1479
01:56:35,960 --> 01:56:36,960
That's it.

1480
01:56:36,960 --> 01:56:37,960
Yeah, we're not doing enough.

1481
01:56:37,960 --> 01:56:40,280
We're not doing enough.

1482
01:56:40,280 --> 01:56:46,360
Let's go ahead and take a call from a listener who's listening on KKGM up in Dallas-Fort

1483
01:56:46,360 --> 01:56:47,360
Worth, 1630.

1484
01:56:47,360 --> 01:56:49,080
Ryan, you're on the air.

1485
01:56:49,080 --> 01:56:50,080
Go.

1486
01:56:50,080 --> 01:56:51,080
Hi.

1487
01:56:51,080 --> 01:56:55,560
There is two ladies that recently got arrested for their smart meters.

1488
01:56:55,560 --> 01:56:58,560
I wanna know, Rosa, did you hear anything about that?

1489
01:56:58,560 --> 01:56:59,960
Cuz I have a similar story.

1490
01:56:59,960 --> 01:57:00,960
Yeah, sure.

1491
01:57:00,960 --> 01:57:07,880
That's in Naperville, and a very good friend of mine, Thelma Tarmena in Houston, actually

1492
01:57:07,880 --> 01:57:11,520
held a gun on the guy who was gonna put one on her house.

1493
01:57:11,520 --> 01:57:16,280
So people are resisting and fighting smart meters.

1494
01:57:16,280 --> 01:57:19,960
Smart meters are, of course, part of United Nations Agenda 21.

1495
01:57:19,960 --> 01:57:25,040
And for those that don't know, they admit that, and all the new appliances, and the

1496
01:57:25,040 --> 01:57:28,760
CIA director admitted, Petraeus said, we're spying on you through your, quote, washing

1497
01:57:28,760 --> 01:57:29,760
machine.

1498
01:57:29,760 --> 01:57:32,720
And all the new ones, it dials in and monitors you.

1499
01:57:32,720 --> 01:57:35,680
I mean, they're putting a giant eavesdropper on your house.

1500
01:57:35,680 --> 01:57:36,680
Check this out, Alex.

1501
01:57:36,680 --> 01:57:40,000
I don't know if you knew this, but you know how they crushed the old cars?

1502
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:45,160
Well, they're going into, you know, like Goodwills and stuff and buying up old appliances and

1503
01:57:45,160 --> 01:57:49,520
crushing those so that you can't get, you won't be able to get an old appliance that

1504
01:57:49,520 --> 01:57:51,000
doesn't have a chip in it.

1505
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:52,520
They know what they're doing, boy.

1506
01:57:52,520 --> 01:57:53,520
Mm-hm.

1507
01:57:53,520 --> 01:57:54,520
That's what the design is, so.

1508
01:57:54,520 --> 01:57:57,160
Think of the diabolical evil, folks.

1509
01:57:57,160 --> 01:57:59,880
I mean, this is a nightmare.

1510
01:57:59,880 --> 01:58:01,640
Yeah, but you know what?

1511
01:58:01,640 --> 01:58:03,240
We are going to win this.

1512
01:58:03,240 --> 01:58:04,240
We need to work together.

1513
01:58:04,240 --> 01:58:05,240
I agree.

1514
01:58:05,240 --> 01:58:06,240
Let's get the information out to people.

1515
01:58:06,240 --> 01:58:07,240
I agree.

1516
01:58:07,240 --> 01:58:09,640
Ryan, what happened to you real fast?

1517
01:58:09,640 --> 01:58:10,640
I had a sign.

1518
01:58:10,640 --> 01:58:16,880
I listened to the lady from Democrats versus Agenda 21, the lady that you have on.

1519
01:58:16,880 --> 01:58:18,600
Anyways, I put a sign on.

1520
01:58:18,600 --> 01:58:21,560
I wrote a bunch of letters to the proper officials.

1521
01:58:21,560 --> 01:58:25,640
I even put a lock onto the smart meter.

1522
01:58:25,640 --> 01:58:30,240
They came through trespass, you know, with the sign said exclusively that you're allowed

1523
01:58:30,240 --> 01:58:32,920
on my property, but not to switch out the meter.

1524
01:58:32,920 --> 01:58:36,520
They ripped the sign down, took off the log, put in the smart meter.

1525
01:58:36,520 --> 01:58:39,200
I called the lady, actually talked to the PR people.

1526
01:58:39,200 --> 01:58:40,200
Stay there.

1527
01:58:40,200 --> 01:58:41,200
Stay there.

Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.

1539
02:00:06,480 --> 02:00:11,280
Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.

1540
02:00:11,280 --> 02:00:12,280
You want answers?

1541
02:00:12,280 --> 02:00:14,400
Well, so does he.

1542
02:00:14,400 --> 02:00:18,600
He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.

1543
02:00:18,600 --> 02:00:22,880
And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.

1544
02:00:22,880 --> 02:00:26,280
Oh, man, I want to go to more of your calls.

1545
02:00:26,280 --> 02:00:27,280
We're almost out of time.

1546
02:00:27,280 --> 02:00:29,800
We've got a powerful in-studio guest as well.

1547
02:00:29,800 --> 02:00:30,800
But she's coming to Texas.

1548
02:00:30,800 --> 02:00:33,600
We'll get her in here for two hours at that time.

1549
02:00:33,600 --> 02:00:37,320
Rosa Corey is our guest, author of Behind the Green Mask.

1550
02:00:37,320 --> 02:00:41,760
Ryan in Texas, yeah, no, it's illegal for them to come across your property and do this.

1551
02:00:41,760 --> 02:00:43,360
They could just turn your power off, I guess.

1552
02:00:43,360 --> 02:00:44,760
Then you've got to argue with them on that.

1553
02:00:44,760 --> 02:00:48,440
That's why they have laws trying to block real solar power you control, they want it

1554
02:00:48,440 --> 02:00:49,440
in their grid.

1555
02:00:49,440 --> 02:00:53,040
And that's really the answer here, is to get out of the system.

1556
02:00:53,040 --> 02:00:58,560
Real sustainability, their sustainability is the opposite of sustainability, it's slavery.

1557
02:00:58,560 --> 02:01:00,880
But what happened when you said you violated my rights?

1558
02:01:00,880 --> 02:01:06,440
They said, well, by law, that we can come in and do whatever we want, that's our property.

1559
02:01:06,440 --> 02:01:10,120
And I said, well, you know what, I want your property removed.

1560
02:01:10,120 --> 02:01:15,400
And I'm gonna take it out, and I'm gonna go on eBay and buy myself a little analog meter

1561
02:01:15,400 --> 02:01:16,400
and replace it.

1562
02:01:16,400 --> 02:01:19,880
And they say, well, if you even touch it, that's tampering and we'll have you arrested.

1563
02:01:19,880 --> 02:01:21,200
And I go, well, I want it out.

1564
02:01:21,200 --> 02:01:24,240
And they go, the only option is for you to go solar.

1565
02:01:24,240 --> 02:01:30,360
And anybody that refuses to have the smart meter installed in the beginning quarter of

1566
02:01:30,360 --> 02:01:33,800
this year, they're just gonna start turning people's powers off.

1567
02:01:33,800 --> 02:01:39,160
You know what, I say go dark, and then they're gonna send the health department saying you're

1568
02:01:39,160 --> 02:01:43,880
unsanitary and stuff, and say, hey, get a civil rights lawsuit, and then bring out that

1569
02:01:43,880 --> 02:01:47,800
they're dialing into everything you're doing, watching and listening to you, including jacking

1570
02:01:47,800 --> 02:01:48,800
your computers.

1571
02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:53,920
This is on record, folks, in the Google Patents and dialing into your camera and microphone.

1572
02:01:53,920 --> 02:01:54,920
God bless you, sir.

1573
02:01:54,920 --> 02:01:56,480
Let's go get a quick comment from Rosa Corey.

1574
02:01:56,480 --> 02:02:00,920
Yeah, this is what the smart grid is about, is about controlling everything that is related

1575
02:02:00,920 --> 02:02:01,920
to technology.

1576
02:02:01,920 --> 02:02:06,960
So your internet, your phone, your electricity, everything.

1577
02:02:06,960 --> 02:02:12,520
And also, it's about, as you said, Alex, it's about identifying people who are dissenters

1578
02:02:12,520 --> 02:02:14,640
and then shutting off their power.

1579
02:02:14,640 --> 02:02:19,640
It's about being able to control, but you do need to resist, I agree, go dark, and then

1580
02:02:19,640 --> 02:02:20,640
fight them.

1581
02:02:20,640 --> 02:02:23,920
We need to do this as a nation, stop it, refuse to collaborate.

1582
02:02:23,920 --> 02:02:27,440
It's time to get back to that anyways, get the candles out, go dark.

1583
02:02:27,440 --> 02:02:32,520
Yeah, I lived like that for a long time in Mexico, it's great.

1584
02:02:32,520 --> 02:02:33,520
It's like camping.

1585
02:02:33,520 --> 02:02:35,760
I mean, go dark, folks, go dark.

1586
02:02:35,760 --> 02:02:37,640
We either fight, and it's only gonna get worse, okay?

1587
02:02:37,640 --> 02:02:41,000
This is a scientific, in their words, technocracy.

1588
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:44,640
They think they've got it all planned out, and they're counting on you to be lazy.

1589
02:02:44,640 --> 02:02:46,200
God bless you, sir.

1590
02:02:46,200 --> 02:02:48,000
Go dark, sue them, fight them.

1591
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:49,400
This is the new civil rights movement.

1592
02:02:49,400 --> 02:02:53,240
While they're busy saying, if you don't wanna turn your guns in, you're a cracker, and that's

1593
02:02:53,240 --> 02:02:56,500
on MSNBC, Total Racism, to create racial division.

1594
02:02:56,500 --> 02:03:00,000
The real discrimination's going on against all of us by the globalist.

1595
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,400
Mike in New Hampshire, you're on the air, welcome.

1596
02:03:02,400 --> 02:03:04,920
Hey, how are you, Alex?

1597
02:03:04,920 --> 02:03:05,920
Good, sir.

1598
02:03:05,920 --> 02:03:06,920
How you doing?

1599
02:03:06,920 --> 02:03:08,920
I got a quick question for you.

1600
02:03:08,920 --> 02:03:09,920
Geez.

1601
02:03:09,920 --> 02:03:13,160
You're almost out of time.

1602
02:03:13,160 --> 02:03:14,160
Almost out of time.

1603
02:03:14,160 --> 02:03:15,160
Yep, yep, yep.

1604
02:03:15,160 --> 02:03:20,240
You know, I'm 36 years old, and I have three children up here, I'm very invested in what's

1605
02:03:20,240 --> 02:03:21,240
going on.

1606
02:03:21,240 --> 02:03:25,440
I would like some sort of brochure that I would commit to knock on every door in my

1607
02:03:25,440 --> 02:03:29,920
town here in Epping, New Hampshire, and telling them about Agenda 21, which I find-

1608
02:03:29,920 --> 02:03:34,120
Okay, look, let me tell you, we have those flyers for you on our website.

1609
02:03:34,120 --> 02:03:42,480
Democrats against UNAgenda21.com, those flyers are called What's Wrong with Sustainable Development,

1610
02:03:42,480 --> 02:03:45,240
and Why Is Everyone Talking About Agenda 21?

1611
02:03:45,240 --> 02:03:48,800
Make those flyers, you can make 100 flyers for six bucks, walk them around, get that

1612
02:03:48,800 --> 02:03:50,520
info out to everyone.

1613
02:03:50,520 --> 02:03:53,280
Absolutely, it's time to hit them and hit them hard.

1614
02:03:53,280 --> 02:03:55,620
And you said you've got children, that's what this is about.

1615
02:03:55,620 --> 02:04:00,560
This is the Chinese communist slave model with a tiny elite on top that are free market

1616
02:04:00,560 --> 02:04:01,560
and get the money.

1617
02:04:01,560 --> 02:04:07,880
The globalist, the CFR admits, the deal they made with the Chinese communist is the plan

1618
02:04:07,880 --> 02:04:08,880
here.

1619
02:04:08,880 --> 02:04:09,880
They've done this in China.

1620
02:04:09,880 --> 02:04:10,880
Rosa?

1621
02:04:10,880 --> 02:04:11,880
Yeah, and that's it.

1622
02:04:11,880 --> 02:04:12,880
This is what we're fighting.

1623
02:04:12,880 --> 02:04:17,920
One great thing is that this year, I am being invited to speak to governors, to Congress

1624
02:04:17,920 --> 02:04:21,280
people, to senators, all across the country.

1625
02:04:21,280 --> 02:04:26,200
So people are getting through to their elected officials, we want to draw this down, we want

1626
02:04:26,200 --> 02:04:27,200
to block it.

1627
02:04:27,200 --> 02:04:29,680
This is an ideology and we will stop it.

1628
02:04:29,680 --> 02:04:33,920
Three people never submit to this kind of tyranny.

1629
02:04:33,920 --> 02:04:34,920
No they don't.

1630
02:04:34,920 --> 02:04:36,200
Rosa Corey, we're going to talk to you again soon.

1631
02:04:36,200 --> 02:04:37,200
Callers, I'll get to you.

1632
02:04:37,200 --> 02:04:39,320
I get to talk to Pastor Williams, we can talk agenda 21.

1633
02:04:39,320 --> 02:04:44,060
The book behind the green mask, UN agenda 21, Rosa Corey available at infoawars.com

1634
02:04:44,060 --> 02:04:45,060
right now.

1635
02:04:45,060 --> 02:04:49,520
But go to her site, print off the flyers in your printer and get them out to people.

1636
02:04:49,520 --> 02:04:51,880
Give the website out one more time.

1637
02:04:51,880 --> 02:04:56,160
Democrats against UN agenda 21.com.

1638
02:04:56,160 --> 02:04:57,160
Great job.

1639
02:04:57,160 --> 02:04:58,160
Great job.

1640
02:04:58,160 --> 02:04:59,160
We'll talk to you soon in studio.

1641
02:04:59,160 --> 02:05:00,160
Thank you.

1642
02:05:00,160 --> 02:05:01,160
Thank you.

1643
02:05:01,160 --> 02:05:02,160
Thank you.

1644
02:05:02,160 --> 02:05:03,160
Thank you.

1645
02:05:03,160 --> 02:05:04,160
Thank you.

1646
02:05:04,160 --> 02:05:10,080

1658
02:06:02,040 --> 02:06:05,440
You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms.

1659
02:06:05,440 --> 02:06:09,400
But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your

1660
02:06:09,400 --> 02:06:11,500
arsenal for home protection.

1661
02:06:11,500 --> 02:06:15,240
When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?

Again, that's GetSimplySafe.com.

1676
02:07:01,440 --> 02:07:06,280
Looking back on 2012, I know personally I'm thanking God that my family and I made it

1677
02:07:06,280 --> 02:07:07,280
through the year.

1678
02:07:07,280 --> 02:07:10,960
From natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the

1679
02:07:10,960 --> 02:07:13,800
family hardships brought on by a disastrous economy.

1680
02:07:13,800 --> 02:07:16,160
Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything.

1681
02:07:16,160 --> 02:07:20,400
My friends at eFoods Direct hear from customers every day that are fortunate to weather life's

1682
02:07:20,400 --> 02:07:22,560
storm by having a supply of food on hand.

1683
02:07:22,560 --> 02:07:27,020
Danny from New York City wrote in following Hurricane Sandy and said, almost all the grocery

1684
02:07:27,020 --> 02:07:31,000
stores are closed, but I managed to get my eFoods just in time to be able to help my

1685
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:32,160
sister and my niece.

1686
02:07:32,160 --> 02:07:36,280
Bottom line, it's better to be prepared 10 years too early than one day too late.

1687
02:07:36,280 --> 02:07:38,920
Heed common sense's warning and do what I've done.

1694
02:08:14,160 --> 02:08:27,600
We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.

1695
02:08:27,600 --> 02:08:32,280
Thank you for joining us again on this Friday, February 1st, 2013 edition.

1696
02:08:32,280 --> 02:08:38,960
I am your host, Alex Jones, and wow, we just had Rosa Corey on with Unigena21, the book,

1697
02:08:38,960 --> 02:08:41,200
and everything she's saying is totally true.

1698
02:08:41,200 --> 02:08:46,640
I mean, we're calling them total eugenics, world government, population reduction, turning

1699
02:08:46,640 --> 02:08:52,960
the cities into total prisons, where everything surveilled beyond 1984, forced abortions,

1700
02:08:52,960 --> 02:09:00,520
suicide nets around the agenda 21 factories, all of it's true and then some.

1701
02:09:00,520 --> 02:09:06,240
And we've just had it so good because of liberty, they can point out the problems with America,

1702
02:09:06,240 --> 02:09:10,040
but compared to other countries, 5% of the population, half the world's wealth.

1703
02:09:10,040 --> 02:09:17,360
Now as the liberty is taken, now as the Constitution is ignored, now as the Bible is ignored, everything's

1704
02:09:17,360 --> 02:09:19,000
going to hell in a handbasket.

1705
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:23,440
And you can't deny that, whether you believe in God or not, when you become decadent, when

1706
02:09:23,440 --> 02:09:28,360
you don't care about other people, when you don't make a stand, when you don't take action,

1707
02:09:28,360 --> 02:09:34,520
you are rudderless and a ship without a rudder just goes around wherever the wind blows it.

1708
02:09:34,520 --> 02:09:40,720
And that's why I have a article up at infowars.com, population control propagandist, this is at

1709
02:09:40,720 --> 02:09:43,280
Yale with top UN officials.

1710
02:09:43,280 --> 02:09:47,680
We get very little opposition from the public because via the television programs, we have

1711
02:09:47,680 --> 02:09:53,920
very gradual evolution of the characters, it's an hour and 50 something minute video,

1712
02:09:53,920 --> 02:09:54,920
you can go watch it.

1713
02:09:54,920 --> 02:09:59,440
Go do it, go watch them laugh about you, go watch them talk about how they're conditioning

1714
02:09:59,440 --> 02:10:00,440
you with the television.

1715
02:10:00,440 --> 02:10:06,000
I mean, you go see those messages that are anti-man, anti-family, anti-liberty, that

1716
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,560
are savage.

1717
02:10:08,560 --> 02:10:11,720
That's because they want to screw you up, they wanna have you be alone.

1718
02:10:11,720 --> 02:10:15,520
And they say that if you go after other groups, you hate them, no, no, no, no.

1719
02:10:15,520 --> 02:10:19,720
What's happening is they want to make us all under the state's control.

1720
02:10:19,720 --> 02:10:24,920
They want to bankrupt us and the Democratic Party officially has adopted by the 60s, the

1721
02:10:24,920 --> 02:10:30,800
Cloward and Piven strategy that we've talked about for 15, 16 years that's become now widely

1722
02:10:30,800 --> 02:10:33,920
understood just like agenda 21.

1723
02:10:33,920 --> 02:10:38,100
Where the top sociologists for the Democratic Party said we're gonna bankrupt things in

1724
02:10:38,100 --> 02:10:42,880
the name of the poor, but it's meant to bankrupt things to bring in our socialist society,

1725
02:10:42,880 --> 02:10:44,040
which isn't even socialist.

1726
02:10:44,040 --> 02:10:48,760
When you hear socialism, that means get control of you so you can be under eugenics.

1727
02:10:48,760 --> 02:10:53,800
Now, I know we got loaded phones, we're gonna get to so many that are patiently holding

1728
02:10:53,800 --> 02:10:57,680
like Sean in Australia, I didn't even notice we had a caller from Australia, William, Eric,

1729
02:10:57,680 --> 02:11:01,240
and we'll probably go into overdrive next hour, cuz our guest is here all the way from

1730
02:11:01,240 --> 02:11:02,240
Arizona.

1731
02:11:02,240 --> 02:11:10,000
I shot a video talking about this last night, Weldon Henson, a few weeks ago, who does research

1732
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:11,000
over what we carry.

1733
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:14,420
Either I watch and read something and like it or have an idea or he's going over stuff

1734
02:11:14,420 --> 02:11:15,720
we're sent and brings it to me.

1735
02:11:15,720 --> 02:11:20,080
And he said, hey, I really like this after the tribulation, let no man be deceived.

1736
02:11:20,080 --> 02:11:21,080
Do you know who these guys are?

1737
02:11:21,080 --> 02:11:25,520
And yes, I know who all three of the men are that are featured in it.

1738
02:11:25,520 --> 02:11:30,120
And it's a very well done film, and it's after the tribulation, let no man be deceived.

1739
02:11:30,120 --> 02:11:32,160
Now, I wanna explain something here.

1740
02:11:32,160 --> 02:11:35,060
Let's say you don't believe in God, you don't believe in a sixth sense.

1741
02:11:35,060 --> 02:11:40,000
You don't know why you know when you're walking through an empty place, you feel somebody

1742
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,760
looking at you and there's a guy behind you.

1743
02:11:42,760 --> 02:11:46,800
You don't know why all that happens, why a monarch butterfly can fly to Canada and back

1744
02:11:46,800 --> 02:11:47,880
or whatever.

1745
02:11:47,880 --> 02:11:52,160
You just think all that is here, the TV is the reality, whatever.

1746
02:11:52,160 --> 02:11:55,400
The elites are all very, very spiritual.

1747
02:11:55,400 --> 02:11:59,080
And let me tell you, they worship something that looks a lot like the devil of the Bible.

1748
02:11:59,080 --> 02:12:03,320
In fact, they say that's who they worship, they believe Lucifer is God.

1749
02:12:03,320 --> 02:12:07,080
And I was brought up a Christian and I have had spiritual experiences and we've got that

1750
02:12:07,080 --> 02:12:09,200
part of our brain connected to our spirit.

1751
02:12:09,200 --> 02:12:12,740
But you get a little bit older and you hear all this, but then when I went to Bohemian

1752
02:12:12,740 --> 02:12:18,840
Grove and saw 1,000 plus world leaders in religious rapture that I'd experienced in

1753
02:12:18,840 --> 02:12:22,240
Baptist and Evangelical churches I went to as a child.

1754
02:12:22,240 --> 02:12:27,680
But on a dark side, people really, in a religious experience, an average atheist goes, they're

1755
02:12:27,680 --> 02:12:32,260
just having fun worshiping the big owl and doing a mock sacrifice to it.

1756
02:12:32,260 --> 02:12:35,720
But you see, when you're there, you know it's not just a play.

1757
02:12:35,720 --> 02:12:40,640
Plays come from religious events thousands of years ago, the stage, the people watching.

1758
02:12:40,640 --> 02:12:44,040
The whole world's a stage, each of us, players upon it, you find out, man, there's something

1759
02:12:44,040 --> 02:12:45,040
going on here.

1760
02:12:45,040 --> 02:12:49,960
But I know this, it was Christians that said no to slavery in Rome 2,000 years ago, it

1761
02:12:49,960 --> 02:12:55,240
got thrown to the lions, going to be technical about 1,960 years ago is what was really going

1762
02:12:55,240 --> 02:12:56,240
on.

1763
02:12:56,240 --> 02:12:59,200
It was Christians said no to slavery in Europe and then finally here.

1764
02:12:59,200 --> 02:13:03,400
Now there's some Bohemian Grove footage from Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, we're

1765
02:13:03,400 --> 02:13:05,480
showing TV viewers.

1766
02:13:05,480 --> 02:13:09,440
The point is, is that if you're a new listener, yes, I snuck into Bohemian Grove where the

1767
02:13:09,440 --> 02:13:12,760
big boys of Skull and Bones go when they're old men.

1768
02:13:12,760 --> 02:13:17,240
And the point I wanna make to everybody out there who's watching, who's viewing us right

1769
02:13:17,240 --> 02:13:22,440
now is that even if you don't believe in a spiritual realm, you have to understand the

1770
02:13:22,440 --> 02:13:26,840
New World Order's greatest tool is convincing you it doesn't exist.

1771
02:13:26,840 --> 02:13:29,880
Because they don't want you looking into it because they believe all the power is there,

1772
02:13:29,880 --> 02:13:31,900
whether it's real or not.

1773
02:13:31,900 --> 02:13:36,280
They don't want you knowing about it and have written that they have pushed atheism and

1774
02:13:36,280 --> 02:13:40,760
agnostic stuff so that you don't even ever think about it.

1775
02:13:40,760 --> 02:13:46,260
It's like the Screwtape letters, a demon talking to a low level demon was written by a great

1776
02:13:46,260 --> 02:13:51,400
British writer, popped my head in a minute, C.S. Lewis.

1777
02:13:51,400 --> 02:13:55,000
They don't even want you getting into the big evils, they just don't want you ever thinking

1778
02:13:55,000 --> 02:14:00,520
outside the box and feeling that connection or they wanna misdirect it if you do discover

1779
02:14:00,520 --> 02:14:01,520
that.

1780
02:14:01,520 --> 02:14:08,120
But regardless, it has been the rapture doctrine that's, what, 150 years old max or so?

1781
02:14:08,120 --> 02:14:10,540
We got a theologian here who can break it down.

1782
02:14:10,540 --> 02:14:16,080
No Christians ever believed, I guess there were a few small groups later in Rome who

1783
02:14:16,080 --> 02:14:23,420
did for a certain period, that it was the end of the world or, don't worry about evil,

1784
02:14:23,420 --> 02:14:24,560
it's the end of the world.

1785
02:14:24,560 --> 02:14:29,040
Our founders are now criticized by TV preachers who are getting government funding and clergy

1786
02:14:29,040 --> 02:14:34,320
response team FEMA money to say, the Christians, I've got the clips, you can just go to YouTube.

1787
02:14:34,320 --> 02:14:40,900
TV preacher says that we shouldn't have, Christians should have obeyed and worshiped the gods

1788
02:14:40,900 --> 02:14:44,560
and shouldn't have been thrown to the lions, twisting Romans 13.

1789
02:14:44,560 --> 02:14:48,060
They teach our founders were bad, they should have followed King George.

1790
02:14:48,060 --> 02:14:51,300
That's all diametrically opposed to everything in the Bible.

1791
02:14:51,300 --> 02:14:55,060
So understand, if you wanna know why we got in this position where the government now

1792
02:14:55,060 --> 02:14:58,380
runs the churches that violates the First Amendment and common sense, this country was

1793
02:14:58,380 --> 02:14:59,440
founded on.

1794
02:14:59,440 --> 02:15:03,640
It's because the leadership got bought off by the World Council of Churches, the National

1795
02:15:03,640 --> 02:15:07,360
Council of Churches, the same Rockefeller groups, go look it up.

1796
02:15:07,360 --> 02:15:12,560
And so from an anthropologist or sociologist view, you need to see after the tribulation

1797
02:15:12,560 --> 02:15:21,080
because the Bible clearly states, the tribulation comes after the devil wages war on the saints

1798
02:15:21,080 --> 02:15:24,940
and overcomes them and chops off their heads by the millions and all of this.

1799
02:15:24,940 --> 02:15:29,240
And I understand why Christians go, no, no, I'm gonna get jet packed out of here, a golden

1800
02:15:29,240 --> 02:15:33,760
rope's gonna come down, Scotty's up there on the enterprise, he's gonna teleport me

1801
02:15:33,760 --> 02:15:34,760
out of here.

1802
02:15:34,760 --> 02:15:38,320
Well, let me tell you something, the Bible from front to back, nobody gets teleported

1803
02:15:38,320 --> 02:15:42,100
out except for one guy who'd been so good, God picked him up.

1804
02:15:42,100 --> 02:15:47,680
But the point is, and he wasn't getting teleported out to escape something, he'd already gone

1805
02:15:47,680 --> 02:15:48,680
through the fire.

1806
02:15:48,680 --> 02:15:52,440
Okay, so I wanna explain some, of course in Christ, of course he did as well, but that

1807
02:15:52,440 --> 02:15:55,200
wasn't really a man, you can go back and forth.

1808
02:15:55,200 --> 02:15:58,560
The point is, is God in man's body.

1809
02:15:58,560 --> 02:16:04,100
The point is, this is the real deal, ladies and gentlemen, okay?

1810
02:16:04,100 --> 02:16:07,840
And they hate Christians and they hate gun owners because they know we understand what's

1811
02:16:07,840 --> 02:16:08,840
going on.

1812
02:16:08,840 --> 02:16:11,640
That's the litmus test that we know they're authoritarians.

1813
02:16:11,640 --> 02:16:15,360
Now he's with us for this hour and a little bit into the next hour.

1814
02:16:15,360 --> 02:16:20,320
After the tribulation, a film that they even did an info war style trailer without us even

1815
02:16:20,320 --> 02:16:24,560
saying it, so I went ahead and tagged on my own promo onto it, it's up at infoawars.com

1816
02:16:24,560 --> 02:16:25,560
right now.

1817
02:16:25,560 --> 02:16:28,160
But after the tribulation, let no man deceive you.

1818
02:16:28,160 --> 02:16:32,960
Everyone needs to buy this at infoawarsstore.com and go give it to their pastor, their preachers

1819
02:16:32,960 --> 02:16:34,040
and others.

1820
02:16:34,040 --> 02:16:39,400
And again, Pastor Steve Anderson is famously 100 mile in checkpoints, he's been beat up

1821
02:16:39,400 --> 02:16:41,600
for asking questions, we'll play some of that later.

1822
02:16:41,600 --> 02:16:46,200
He's the guy that said he prays for Obama to be brought down, which is biblical, got

1823
02:16:46,200 --> 02:16:47,440
demonized for that.

1824
02:16:47,440 --> 02:16:51,020
The pastor of Steven Anderson was born and raised in Sacramento, California.

1825
02:16:51,020 --> 02:16:52,520
He's married with seven beautiful children.

1826
02:16:52,520 --> 02:16:56,920
At age 18, he traveled throughout Germany and Eastern Europe with Baptist churches studying

1827
02:16:56,920 --> 02:16:59,520
foreign languages and getting experience in the ministry.

1828
02:16:59,520 --> 02:17:03,920
Pastor Anderson started a totally independent Baptist church, Faithful World Baptist Church

1829
02:17:03,920 --> 02:17:11,840
on December 25th, 2005, so I guess seven, eight years old now and faithfulworldbaptist.org

1830
02:17:11,840 --> 02:17:12,840
is the website.

1831
02:17:12,840 --> 02:17:14,200
Okay, we're going to break in a few minutes.

1832
02:17:14,200 --> 02:17:19,320
Great to have you here, but let's get right in to this film and the scriptures and where

1833
02:17:19,320 --> 02:17:25,800
this doctrine came that it's a pre-tribulation rapture, so nobody's got to worry about anything.

1834
02:17:25,800 --> 02:17:30,040
All the other Christians had to go through the fire, but this generation, as it's all

1835
02:17:30,040 --> 02:17:31,800
coming down, we're going to be left alone.

1836
02:17:31,800 --> 02:17:33,720
Hey, thanks for having me on, Alex.

1837
02:17:33,720 --> 02:17:34,720
Good to be here.

1838
02:17:34,720 --> 02:17:39,920
I think this film is most important because if you want to know why Christians are asleep

1839
02:17:39,920 --> 02:17:43,160
right now, if you want to know why the vast majority of Christians don't want to hear

1840
02:17:43,160 --> 02:17:46,920
about the New World Order, they don't care when you warn them about global government

1841
02:17:46,920 --> 02:17:49,800
or police state, it's because of this doctrine.

1842
02:17:49,800 --> 02:17:54,920
This pre-trib rapture doctrine makes everybody believe that it doesn't really matter what's

1843
02:17:54,920 --> 02:17:56,920
going on because we're all going to be out of here.

1844
02:17:56,920 --> 02:18:01,280
And there was a pastor in Arizona that I know who recently said to me, as soon as he found

1845
02:18:01,280 --> 02:18:06,140
out that I didn't believe in this pre-tribulation rapture, he said, well, now I understand why

1846
02:18:06,140 --> 02:18:08,440
you're so paranoid about government.

1847
02:18:08,440 --> 02:18:09,440
Because he'd seen all the stuff with-

1848
02:18:09,440 --> 02:18:13,640
Yeah, that's sick that they don't care about, even if they were going to be teleported out.

1849
02:18:13,640 --> 02:18:15,240
Don't they care about all the people now?

1850
02:18:15,240 --> 02:18:16,240
No, they don't.

1851
02:18:16,240 --> 02:18:17,240
They sit around at country clubs.

1852
02:18:17,240 --> 02:18:21,040
Yeah, so he said, now I see why you're so paranoid about government, but I'd like to

1853
02:18:21,040 --> 02:18:25,160
turn that around on him and say, now I see why you don't give a rip about anything that's

1854
02:18:25,160 --> 02:18:26,160
going on.

1855
02:18:26,160 --> 02:18:30,120
Now I see why you trust the government so much because you believe this fairy tale that

1856
02:18:30,120 --> 02:18:32,560
we're going to be taken out of here before-

1857
02:18:32,560 --> 02:18:37,720
Homeland Security is now saying the number one enemy of the groups is the Christians.

1858
02:18:37,720 --> 02:18:42,680
Remember Janet Reno said, a believer that believes in the second coming of Christ, that

1859
02:18:42,680 --> 02:18:44,280
is a mentally ill cult member.

1860
02:18:44,280 --> 02:18:46,560
Yeah, and this is all prophesied in the Bible.

1861
02:18:46,560 --> 02:18:49,240
The Bible's real clear that eventually Christians are going to be-

1862
02:18:49,240 --> 02:18:53,760
The smart meters, the chips, the face scanning, the hands, all of it, world government, the

1863
02:18:53,760 --> 02:18:56,640
exact empires, the name of it, everything.

1864
02:18:56,640 --> 02:19:00,980
It's all in the Bible, and the amazing thing is that people 100 years ago might have read

1865
02:19:00,980 --> 02:19:04,000
the Bible and wondered, how could this be implemented?

1866
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:07,120
How do you stop people from buying or selling?

1867
02:19:07,120 --> 02:19:10,840
How do you take this kind of global power over every single nation in the world?

1868
02:19:10,840 --> 02:19:12,280
But now we can see it happen.

1869
02:19:12,280 --> 02:19:15,840
The UN says 10 kingdoms, they call it 10 kingdoms.

1870
02:19:15,840 --> 02:19:16,840
Right.

1871
02:19:16,840 --> 02:19:17,840
It's all there.

1872
02:19:17,840 --> 02:19:18,840
It's all, I mean, they're following it.

1873
02:19:18,840 --> 02:19:21,920
The only other argument is, well, they're using it as a template of control, like it's

1874
02:19:21,920 --> 02:19:24,680
a science fiction book and they go, ooh, this is a good plan.

1875
02:19:24,680 --> 02:19:27,080
Oh, and they worship the devil on top of it?

1876
02:19:27,080 --> 02:19:29,320
But that's a joke too, I guess.

1877
02:19:29,320 --> 02:19:30,320
There's no way.

1878
02:19:30,320 --> 02:19:33,960
I mean, obviously the Bible has been talking about this stuff since hundreds and hundreds

1879
02:19:33,960 --> 02:19:35,060
of years ago.

1880
02:19:35,060 --> 02:19:36,060
It's crystal clear.

1881
02:19:36,060 --> 02:19:40,760
It's like reading a newspaper when you read the Bible about the one world government,

1882
02:19:40,760 --> 02:19:44,440
global warfare, the engineered famines that...

1883
02:19:44,440 --> 02:19:45,880
Bioweapons, weather control.

1884
02:19:45,880 --> 02:19:47,240
All of it.

1885
02:19:47,240 --> 02:19:53,160
Metal insects that drop things that turn into mountains of fire, columns, hydrogen bombs.

1886
02:19:53,160 --> 02:19:54,160
I mean, it's all there.

1887
02:19:54,160 --> 02:19:55,160
It's all there.

1888
02:19:55,160 --> 02:20:00,440
I mean, the people having these visions were like, I saw metal giant insects, mountains

1889
02:20:00,440 --> 02:20:01,440
of flame.

1890
02:20:01,440 --> 02:20:02,440
I mean...

1891
02:20:02,440 --> 02:20:05,680
If you've ever wanted one of our best selling generators, but we're waiting for an offer

1892
02:20:05,680 --> 02:20:10,680
so crazy you couldn't refuse, then you're not going to want to miss this exciting message.

1893
02:20:10,680 --> 02:20:11,680
Here's why.

1894
02:20:11,680 --> 02:20:16,960
Our solar generators provide life saving electrical power and unlike gas generators, solar generators

1895
02:20:16,960 --> 02:20:21,360
run quietly, emit no fumes and produce electricity from the sun.

1896
02:20:21,360 --> 02:20:24,760
So when the lights go out, you'll always have the power you need.

1897
02:20:24,760 --> 02:20:26,400
Now here's the best part.

1898
02:20:26,400 --> 02:20:31,080
Every year we accumulate a few solar generators that we just can't sell as new.

1899
02:20:31,080 --> 02:20:36,260
We put them in a special spot in our warehouse and we discount them heavily at the end of

1900
02:20:36,260 --> 02:20:37,260
each year.

1901
02:20:37,260 --> 02:20:41,000
We call them scratch and dent units, but they're really just like new.

1902
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:46,200
Each unit comes with a full factory warranty and special bonuses you just won't believe.

1903
02:20:46,200 --> 02:20:47,200
Don't wait.

1904
02:20:47,200 --> 02:20:48,200
They go fast.

1905
02:20:48,200 --> 02:20:51,640
Go to scratchanddentsolar.com, that's scratchanddentsolar.com.

1906
02:20:51,640 --> 02:21:03,320
For the craziest offer we've ever made, go to scratchanddentsolar.com, that's scratchanddentsolar.com.

1907
02:21:03,320 --> 02:21:08,840
You land in Buenos Aires, then a shuttle to Santa Rosa where a nicely furnished cabin

1908
02:21:08,840 --> 02:21:14,960
with all amenities, Wi-Fi, executive food and wine and laundry service awaits.

1909
02:21:14,960 --> 02:21:18,360
After a good night's sleep, your adventure begins.

1910
02:21:18,360 --> 02:21:25,560
We're on a golden stag safari for big game, but it's not Africa, it's Argentina.

1911
02:21:25,560 --> 02:21:31,840
One-on-one guided hunts for water buffalo, huger, bighorn rams, wild boar and the biggest

1912
02:21:31,840 --> 02:21:39,520
stag deer in South America, all gold medal quality, all the action you can handle.

1913
02:21:39,520 --> 02:21:44,860
Land rovers, top rental guns with scopes, all food, beverages, hunting guides, ground

1914
02:21:44,860 --> 02:21:50,360
transportation included and more, all more affordable than you can imagine.

1915
02:21:50,360 --> 02:21:55,520
The adventure of a lifetime starts at goldenstagsafaris.com.

1916
02:21:55,520 --> 02:21:59,480
The big game hunting ranch, goldenstagsafaris.com.

1917
02:21:59,480 --> 02:22:03,120
Oh, great, now I've got to go to court.

1918
02:22:03,120 --> 02:22:05,760
Meet Tina, now facing a future court date.

1919
02:22:05,760 --> 02:22:07,560
I can't afford an attorney.

1920
02:22:07,560 --> 02:22:11,760
Then learn how to represent yourself in court step by step without a lawyer.

1921

The leader in lawsuit self-help since 1997.

1928
02:22:30,200 --> 02:22:32,160
Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

1929
02:22:32,160 --> 02:22:35,920
Have you ever wondered why banks, stock workers, investment advisors won't talk about gold

1930
02:22:35,920 --> 02:22:36,920
IRAs?

1931
02:22:36,920 --> 02:22:40,900
They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value

1932
02:22:40,900 --> 02:22:42,560
of gold for your retirement.

1933
02:22:42,560 --> 02:22:46,040
Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

1934
02:22:46,040 --> 02:22:51,000
If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.

1935
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:56,600
Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns, call 800-686-2237.

1936
02:22:56,600 --> 02:22:59,600
Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.

1937
02:22:59,600 --> 02:23:02,640
Hi there.

1938
02:23:02,640 --> 02:23:03,640
My name is Frank Bates.

1939
02:23:03,640 --> 02:23:07,920
What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble.

1940
02:23:07,920 --> 02:23:14,160
I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity

1941
02:23:14,160 --> 02:23:18,760
monopolies and government agencies for what they really are, incompetent, lying crooks

1942
02:23:18,760 --> 02:23:24,000
that are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high.

1943
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:28,020
Some have called this a conspiracy, others have called it a cover-up, and you will be

1944
02:23:28,020 --> 02:23:31,920
shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy goes.

1945
02:23:31,920 --> 02:23:37,560
My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them

1946
02:23:37,560 --> 02:23:40,000
and how you can beat them too.

1947
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:43,760
Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen

1948
02:23:43,760 --> 02:23:45,480
in the last three months.

1949
02:23:45,480 --> 02:23:50,840
Go to 123coverup.com and discover one weird trick to slash your power bill and protect

1950
02:23:50,840 --> 02:23:51,960
your home.

1951
02:23:51,960 --> 02:23:57,760
Go watch my video now at 123coverup.com before they force me to shut it down.

1952
02:23:57,760 --> 02:24:17,800
Again, that's 123coverup.com.

1953
02:24:17,800 --> 02:24:22,000
Pastor Steve Anderson, who's one of the people in this great new film, After the Tribulation

1954
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:23,000
is our guest.

1955
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:26,000
Okay, I'm ranting and raving.

1956
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:29,080
Starting with the points you were making during the break, and let's get into what the Bible

1957
02:24:29,080 --> 02:24:30,080
really says.

1958
02:24:30,080 --> 02:24:33,940
And again, even if you're not a Christian, this is what governs over two billion people

1959
02:24:33,940 --> 02:24:38,480
on the planet who say they're one form of Christian or another, and they're all being

1960
02:24:38,480 --> 02:24:40,280
told you're all gonna be raptured.

1961
02:24:40,280 --> 02:24:44,560
Hollywood loves to promote it, it's what all the TV ads say, and it turns out they're all

1962
02:24:44,560 --> 02:24:48,080
basically clergy response team federal agents.

1963
02:24:48,080 --> 02:24:49,080
Go over it.

1964
02:24:49,080 --> 02:24:53,380
Yeah, let me just start out by saying that this doctrine of the pre-tribulation rapture

1965
02:24:53,380 --> 02:24:55,440
is not found in the Bible at all.

1966
02:24:55,440 --> 02:24:59,760
It's not derived from any scripture, and it's like the emperor's new clothes.

1967
02:24:59,760 --> 02:25:04,080
Everybody goes around saying, of course we believe in it, all the pastors preach it,

1968
02:25:04,080 --> 02:25:07,960
but nobody ever stops to ask themselves, wait a minute, is this even taught in the Bible?

1969
02:25:07,960 --> 02:25:13,200
And it all is relying upon one key point, that they teach that Jesus can come back at

1970
02:25:13,200 --> 02:25:14,460
any moment.

1971
02:25:14,460 --> 02:25:18,540
And you'll hear a lot of TV preachers saying, he may even come back before I'm done with

1972
02:25:18,540 --> 02:25:19,540
this sermon.

1973
02:25:19,540 --> 02:25:22,840
Come like a thief in the night, no man know the time.

1974
02:25:22,840 --> 02:25:25,060
Send your money now, you don't need it.

1975
02:25:25,060 --> 02:25:26,300
We could be gone tomorrow.

1976
02:25:26,300 --> 02:25:31,600
So this doctrine that says that Jesus is coming at any moment is not found in scripture at

1977
02:25:31,600 --> 02:25:32,600
all.

1978
02:25:32,600 --> 02:25:36,800
And what they're twisting is where Jesus Christ said in Matthew 24, of that day and hour,

1979
02:25:36,800 --> 02:25:40,920
he said, but of that day and hour, knoweth no man, know not the angels of heaven.

1980
02:25:40,920 --> 02:25:44,280
But what they forgot to tell you is that a couple of verses before that, he said it was

1981
02:25:44,280 --> 02:25:45,740
after the tribulation.

1982
02:25:45,740 --> 02:25:49,800
So he said after the tribulation, he's coming in the clouds, the trumpet's gonna sound.

1983
02:25:49,800 --> 02:25:50,800
Then a couple of verses later-

1984
02:25:50,800 --> 02:25:53,480
And he said no stone will be left unturned in this war.

1985
02:25:53,480 --> 02:25:57,840
A couple of verses later, he says, but of that day and hour, knoweth no man, know not

1986
02:25:57,840 --> 02:25:59,500
the angels of heaven, but my Father only.

1987
02:25:59,500 --> 02:26:02,160
So they quote that one verse hoping that you're too ignorant.

1988
02:26:02,160 --> 02:26:04,840
Yeah, quote the other voice, the earlier part.

1989
02:26:04,840 --> 02:26:10,680
Okay, it says in verse 29 of Matthew 24, immediately after the tribulation of those days, shall

1990
02:26:10,680 --> 02:26:15,160
the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from

1991
02:26:15,160 --> 02:26:18,160
the heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken.

1992
02:26:18,160 --> 02:26:19,180
You're gonna notice that.

1993
02:26:19,180 --> 02:26:22,620
This isn't some secret, left behind, everybody disappears thing.

1994
02:26:22,620 --> 02:26:23,620
It's talking about the sun and moon being-

1995
02:26:23,620 --> 02:26:25,160
Stop's gonna be blowing up.

1996
02:26:25,160 --> 02:26:29,360
And it says, then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven.

1997
02:26:29,360 --> 02:26:31,760
Son of man is what Jesus called himself on this earth.

1998
02:26:31,760 --> 02:26:35,260
And then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the son of man coming

1999
02:26:35,260 --> 02:26:38,820
in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory, and he shall send his angels with a

2000
02:26:38,820 --> 02:26:43,140
great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds from

2001
02:26:43,140 --> 02:26:44,220
one end of heaven to the other.

2002
02:26:44,220 --> 02:26:47,720
The elect in the New Testament is always referring to those that are believers, those that are

2003
02:26:47,720 --> 02:26:49,420
saved, those who believe in Christ.

2004
02:26:49,420 --> 02:26:54,040
So they totally skip over that part, and they jump down to verse 36, where it says, but

2005
02:26:54,040 --> 02:26:58,600
of that day and hour, knoweth no man know not the angels of heaven, but my Father only.

2006
02:26:58,600 --> 02:27:02,580
And again, I've read the Bible, the whole thing foreshadows in the Old Testament what's

2007
02:27:02,580 --> 02:27:03,580
going to happen.

2008
02:27:03,580 --> 02:27:07,780
It says in the New Testament, it says in Revelation, over and over again, it describes how the

2009
02:27:07,780 --> 02:27:11,440
devil goes after God's people, and they have to stand against it.

2010
02:27:11,440 --> 02:27:15,640
Because it's not about what happens to their body, it's about their soul and having the

2011
02:27:15,640 --> 02:27:16,640
courage.

2012
02:27:16,640 --> 02:27:21,940
It's ridiculous, it is the emperor's, is totally naked here.

2013
02:27:21,940 --> 02:27:24,260
Exactly, and there's no basis for it.

2014
02:27:24,260 --> 02:27:28,640
But anyway, the scripture that I just read for you, where it said, after the tribulation,

2015
02:27:28,640 --> 02:27:32,420
Christ comes in the clouds, he gathers the elect, the trumpet sounds.

2016
02:27:32,420 --> 02:27:36,820
When you try to show this to one of these pre-trib preachers, they'll tell you, well,

2017
02:27:36,820 --> 02:27:38,680
that's not even about the rapture.

2018
02:27:38,680 --> 02:27:42,140
But then these same people will turn around and quote you that no man knoweth the day

2019
02:27:42,140 --> 02:27:43,340
or the hour all day long.

2020
02:27:43,340 --> 02:27:45,320
No, I've had them do it to me in person.

2021
02:27:45,320 --> 02:27:48,800
Even though it's just a couple verses later, so it's like they just take that one verse

2022
02:27:48,800 --> 02:27:49,800
out of context.

2023
02:27:49,800 --> 02:27:53,380
Now, you brought up the part about the thief in the night, where they say, Jesus is coming

2024
02:27:53,380 --> 02:27:55,740
as a thief in the night, he can come at any moment.

2025
02:27:55,740 --> 02:28:00,020
But here's what's funny, if you actually go to that passage where it says that he's coming

2026
02:28:00,020 --> 02:28:02,940
as a thief in the night, in 1 Thessalonians 5.

2027
02:28:02,940 --> 02:28:08,540
If you go down two verses, it says, but ye, brethren, are not in darkness that that day

2028
02:28:08,540 --> 02:28:10,180
should overtake you as a thief.

2029
02:28:10,180 --> 02:28:13,060
Ye are all the children of the light and the children of the day.

2030
02:28:13,060 --> 02:28:14,860
We are not of the night nor of darkness.

2031
02:28:14,860 --> 02:28:18,900
Therefore, let us not sleep as do others, but let us watch and be sober.

2032
02:28:18,900 --> 02:28:22,140
It's saying the dumbed down masses won't know what hit them.

2033
02:28:22,140 --> 02:28:23,140
Exactly.

2034
02:28:23,140 --> 02:28:27,060
He says that it's coming upon those that do not believe, those who don't know.

2035
02:28:27,060 --> 02:28:29,660
We all know it's coming, we all see the freight train.

2036
02:28:29,660 --> 02:28:32,820
Why would it come upon us as a thief in the night when he's telling us exactly what's

2037
02:28:32,820 --> 02:28:33,820
gonna happen?

2038
02:28:33,820 --> 02:28:36,620
He says you're not in darkness that that day should overtake you.

2039
02:28:36,620 --> 02:28:37,620
Totally clear, totally clear.

2040
02:28:37,620 --> 02:28:38,620
Exactly.

2041
02:28:38,620 --> 02:28:41,040
That's why you gotta stop listening to preachers and read the Bible.

2042
02:28:41,040 --> 02:28:45,300
It's gonna overtake them as a thief because the Bible says they're asleep.

2043
02:28:45,300 --> 02:28:46,840
We're not asleep as others.

2044
02:28:46,840 --> 02:28:51,820
He said wake up, watch, be sober, read the Bible, know this is coming.

2045
02:28:51,820 --> 02:28:56,100
He says when you begin to see these things come to pass, then lift up your heads, look

2046
02:28:56,100 --> 02:28:57,980
up, your redemption draweth nigh.

2047
02:28:57,980 --> 02:29:01,180
But there's nothing in the Bible that teaches that Jesus can come at any moment.

2048
02:29:01,180 --> 02:29:04,060
He said, look, X, Y, and Z has to come first.

2049
02:29:04,060 --> 02:29:08,540
And what's funny is the two main passages I encourage people to read are Matthew 24

2050
02:29:08,540 --> 02:29:10,660
and 2 Thessalonians chapter 2.

2051
02:29:10,660 --> 02:29:15,260
And in both of these passages, he uses the term let no man deceive you.

2052
02:29:15,260 --> 02:29:21,060
And then he goes on to explain how his coming is not at any moment, and that first the tribulation

2053
02:29:21,060 --> 02:29:22,060
comes.

2054
02:29:22,060 --> 02:29:23,100
First the sun and moon are darkened.

2055
02:29:23,100 --> 02:29:25,020
So that tells me something's out to deceive us.

2056
02:29:25,020 --> 02:29:27,540
Christ is even saying now I'm gonna tell you when this is gonna happen, but people are

2057
02:29:27,540 --> 02:29:28,540
gonna try to deceive you on this.

2058
02:29:28,540 --> 02:29:29,540
Exactly.

2059
02:29:29,540 --> 02:29:30,540
Listen carefully.

2060
02:29:30,540 --> 02:29:31,540
Right.

2061
02:29:31,540 --> 02:29:32,540
And a five year old could tell what he's saying.

2062
02:29:32,540 --> 02:29:33,540
And these preachers twisted.

2063
02:29:33,540 --> 02:29:34,540
I figured it out when I was 12.

2064
02:29:34,540 --> 02:29:40,100
Well, we're gonna come right back and talk about, as you go back to this, this got pushed

2065
02:29:40,100 --> 02:29:41,940
by the globalists about 150 years ago.

2066
02:29:41,940 --> 02:29:42,940
Exactly.

2067
02:29:42,940 --> 02:29:44,660
Because they were sick of Christians always fighting evil.

2068
02:29:44,660 --> 02:29:49,580
They said, don't worry about it, go have us go have some fun.

2069
02:29:49,580 --> 02:29:50,580
Scotty's up there.

2070
02:29:50,580 --> 02:29:51,580
He's gonna beam you.

2071
02:29:51,580 --> 02:29:52,580
We're on the march.

2072
02:29:52,580 --> 02:29:54,900
The empire's on the run.

2073

02:33:12,620 --> 02:33:17,900
What he means is Old Testament, Mr. Mayor, real wrath of God type stuff, fire and brimstone

2122
02:33:17,900 --> 02:33:22,140
coming down from the skies, rivers and seas boiling, 40 years of darkness, earthquakes,

2123
02:33:22,140 --> 02:33:27,340
volcanoes, the dead rising from the grave, human sacrifice, dogs and cats living together,

2124
02:33:27,340 --> 02:33:28,340
the necessary.

2125
02:33:28,340 --> 02:33:37,260
I have sworn upon the altar of God, eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over

2126
02:33:37,260 --> 02:33:46,820
the mind of man, Thomas Jefferson, live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's

2127
02:33:46,820 --> 02:33:47,820
Alex Jones.

2128
02:33:47,820 --> 02:33:54,900
Sean in Australia, we're going to get to you, John, who disagrees, will be a pre-trip rapture,

2129
02:33:54,900 --> 02:33:58,020
we're going to get to him, we're going to get to everybody, I know people were holding

2130
02:33:58,020 --> 02:34:01,900
over from the last interview, but it all ties together this total control grid and we're

2131
02:34:01,900 --> 02:34:08,060
not judging people out there who are Christians and think there's going to be a pre-trip rapture.

2132
02:34:08,060 --> 02:34:11,920
You guys are getting freaked out by it because it's now doctrinal that you're going to hell

2133
02:34:11,920 --> 02:34:13,420
if you don't believe in this.

2134
02:34:13,420 --> 02:34:17,840
It's not about Jesus and the blood of Jesus, it's about the rapture happening before and

2135
02:34:17,840 --> 02:34:24,040
this is universal now across the board, especially in the Protestant circles.

2136
02:34:24,040 --> 02:34:30,580
This is it, it's not saved by grace alone, there's a pre-trip rapture because you've

2137
02:34:30,580 --> 02:34:35,420
got to think this so you stand down and go along with it.

2138
02:34:35,420 --> 02:34:37,980
And boy, are people in for a rude awakening.

2139
02:34:37,980 --> 02:34:41,340
I want to talk about the history of this, where it came from, what happened to you as

2140
02:34:41,340 --> 02:34:45,600
a Baptist preacher, you said you knew this when you were 12, reading the Bible, go through

2141
02:34:45,600 --> 02:34:47,320
that and then we'll go to some calls.

2142
02:34:47,320 --> 02:34:53,780
It's all covered in the film After the Tribulation, available at Infowarsshop.com or Infowarsstore.com,

2143
02:34:53,780 --> 02:34:55,500
both URLs will get you there.

2144
02:34:55,500 --> 02:35:00,820
And you know what, it's important to talk about this and to look at it because Christ,

2145
02:35:00,820 --> 02:35:04,020
I know he's not the preacher so he doesn't really count, he's kind of the back of the

2146
02:35:04,020 --> 02:35:06,340
bust saying that.

2147
02:35:06,340 --> 02:35:09,540
And I know it says the beast will wage war against the saints and overcome them and all

2148
02:35:09,540 --> 02:35:10,540
that.

2149
02:35:10,540 --> 02:35:13,900
And then it clearly says at the end of the tribulation when Christ comes back, the dead

2150
02:35:13,900 --> 02:35:16,120
are raised and all that, but that's the Bible.

2151
02:35:16,120 --> 02:35:20,260
The Bible takes a backseat to the preachers who were the clergy response team on FEMA

2152
02:35:20,260 --> 02:35:23,900
payroll, violating the First Amendment with the federal government controlling them.

2153
02:35:23,900 --> 02:35:25,580
But I guess they are my Pharisee kings.

2154
02:35:25,580 --> 02:35:26,820
Okay, I'm sorry, go ahead.

2155
02:35:26,820 --> 02:35:28,740
Okay, so here's the history on this.

2156
02:35:28,740 --> 02:35:34,460
Before the year 1830, every denomination, every type of Christianity taught that the

2157
02:35:34,460 --> 02:35:38,700
rapture took place after the tribulation because that's what the Bible explicitly says.

2158
02:35:38,700 --> 02:35:40,820
Why would anyone teach anything different?

2159
02:35:40,820 --> 02:35:45,300
But in the late 1830s, a man by the name of John Nelson Darby started teaching a doctrine

2160
02:35:45,300 --> 02:35:49,740
of what he called the secret rapture, which is this idea that people are gonna disappear,

2161
02:35:49,740 --> 02:35:54,820
nobody knows where they went, nobody knows what's going on, it happens before the tribulation.

2162
02:35:54,820 --> 02:35:58,220
Okay, he promoted and taught that doctrine throughout the 1800s.

2163
02:35:58,220 --> 02:36:02,620
He put out his own version of the Bible, the Darby translation, where he tampered with

2164
02:36:02,620 --> 02:36:05,180
key passages about the second coming of Christ.

2165
02:36:05,180 --> 02:36:06,380
He's famous for that.

2166
02:36:06,380 --> 02:36:07,380
Oh, yeah.

2167
02:36:07,380 --> 02:36:10,980
And then later on, it was picked up by a guy named Scofield.

2168
02:36:10,980 --> 02:36:14,580
And this guy Scofield put out a Scofield reference Bible.

2169
02:36:14,580 --> 02:36:19,080
And that is what is responsible for getting it to all the Baptists, all the seminaries

2170
02:36:19,080 --> 02:36:21,420
started really pushing the Scofield reference Bible.

2171
02:36:21,420 --> 02:36:25,260
I just got a call this week of people trying to sell me Scofield Bibles.

2172
02:36:25,260 --> 02:36:30,620
And so the Scofield Bible is all about getting the pre-trib rapture doctrine out to people.

2173
02:36:30,620 --> 02:36:34,860
Now, because this doctrine is not found in the Bible at all, there's no clear scripture

2174
02:36:34,860 --> 02:36:39,020
that anybody can point to that shows you, here's where it says before the tribulation,

2175
02:36:39,020 --> 02:36:41,300
Jesus comes in the clouds.

2176
02:36:41,300 --> 02:36:45,960
They have to rely on a lot of fear and intimidation to make sure that all the preachers walk in

2177
02:36:45,960 --> 02:36:46,960
line.

2178
02:36:46,960 --> 02:36:51,100
Now, just in my own personal life, I started pastoring seven years ago, and I was sent

2179
02:36:51,100 --> 02:36:55,140
out to start an independent Baptist church in Phoenix, Arizona, the church that sent

2180
02:36:55,140 --> 02:36:59,540
me out as soon as they found out that I did not believe in the pre-tribulation rapture

2181
02:36:59,540 --> 02:37:03,800
because I preached a sermon, you know, where I explained why it was false.

2182
02:37:03,800 --> 02:37:09,460
They immediately cut all ties with me cut all contact with me disowned me effectively.

2183
02:37:09,460 --> 02:37:14,220
And honestly, any pastor who preaches against the pre-tribulation rapture is going to pay

2184
02:37:14,220 --> 02:37:15,700
a big price.

2185
02:37:15,700 --> 02:37:19,220
They're going to lose their preacher friends, they're going to lose any kind of funding,

2186
02:37:19,220 --> 02:37:22,660
because if you are not pre-trib, you are not in the club.

2187
02:37:22,660 --> 02:37:27,300
And they have to rely on that blackballing of anybody who will question it in order to

2188
02:37:27,300 --> 02:37:33,820
make sure that every Baptist and every evangelical is in lockstep teaching the preacher rapture.

2189
02:37:33,820 --> 02:37:40,300
Let me tell you something, every single Baptist Bible college or Baptist seminary or evangelical

2190
02:37:40,300 --> 02:37:44,920
Bible college that I know of teaches the pre-tribulation rapture and they demand that their graduates

2191
02:37:44,920 --> 02:37:45,920
believe it.

2192
02:37:45,920 --> 02:37:49,020
And they even have Hollywood movies where the aliens come and take the good people away.

2193
02:37:49,020 --> 02:37:50,780
Even the Hollywoods pushing this.

2194
02:37:50,780 --> 02:37:55,100
And every single church I've ever been in had people who believed right on this.

2195
02:37:55,100 --> 02:37:57,660
Because you know, there are people who believe it or not, there are some people actually

2196
02:37:57,660 --> 02:37:58,980
read the Bible and believe it.

2197
02:37:58,980 --> 02:38:00,420
You were saying when you were 12.

2198
02:38:00,420 --> 02:38:03,040
When I was 12, I believed it right on this since I was 12.

2199
02:38:03,040 --> 02:38:06,560
I grew up being taught the pre-trib rapture in every church I've ever been to.

2200
02:38:06,560 --> 02:38:10,020
But when I was 12, I decided to read the Bible or I'm sorry, the New Testament, I wanted

2201
02:38:10,020 --> 02:38:11,940
to read cover to cover for the first time.

2202
02:38:11,940 --> 02:38:16,780
I started in Matthew and by the time I got to chapter 24 and read what Jesus said, it

2203
02:38:16,780 --> 02:38:20,620
was clear to me and I've never believed in the pre-trib rapture since since reading Matthew.

2204
02:38:20,620 --> 02:38:23,060
Well what does your gut and spirit tell you?

2205
02:38:23,060 --> 02:38:25,500
I mean God is going to put us through the fire.

2206
02:38:25,500 --> 02:38:30,500
Now if we go halfway, God sometimes protects his people, but you just don't get out of

2207
02:38:30,500 --> 02:38:31,500
the whole deal.

2208
02:38:31,500 --> 02:38:33,180
I mean none of the prophets did.

2209
02:38:33,180 --> 02:38:39,980
The Bible says ye and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.

2210
02:38:39,980 --> 02:38:44,500
And the Bible says, these things have I spoken unto you that in me you might have peace.

2211
02:38:44,500 --> 02:38:49,800
In the world you shall have tribulation, but be of good cheer, I've overcome the world.

2212
02:38:49,800 --> 02:38:51,340
The Bible warns us over and over again.

2213
02:38:51,340 --> 02:38:55,320
I would just encourage anybody who's listening and skeptical about what I'm saying, look

2214
02:38:55,320 --> 02:38:58,820
up in a concordance every time the Bible uses the word tribulation.

2215
02:38:58,820 --> 02:39:04,500
90% of the time the word tribulation is used in the New Testament, it's referring to believers

2216
02:39:04,500 --> 02:39:08,980
going through trials and tribulations and suffering and persecution because of them

2217
02:39:08,980 --> 02:39:11,100
taking a stand for the word of God.

2218
02:39:11,100 --> 02:39:14,780
Because if you take a stand and preach the word of God, you're gonna be persecuted.

2219
02:39:14,780 --> 02:39:18,400
The whole book of Acts is people being thrown in jail.

2220
02:39:18,400 --> 02:39:19,400
It's people being arrested.

2221
02:39:19,400 --> 02:39:23,340
Have you seen the big TV preachers, I played the clips now, saying the Christians were

2222
02:39:23,340 --> 02:39:26,100
wrong to not do what Rome said and worship those idols.

2223
02:39:26,100 --> 02:39:28,580
Romans 13, do what they say.

2224
02:39:28,580 --> 02:39:33,000
I haven't seen it, but I know from reading the book of Acts, the Jews were constantly

2225
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:34,660
persecuting the Christians.

2226
02:39:34,660 --> 02:39:37,420
They were taking them out of the synagogues, they were beating them, they were putting

2227
02:39:37,420 --> 02:39:38,420
them to death.

2228
02:39:38,420 --> 02:39:42,500
And all throughout the book of Acts, every Bible-believing preacher is getting arrested,

2229
02:39:42,500 --> 02:39:45,620
he's getting beaten, he's getting persecuted, he's getting in prison.

2230
02:39:45,620 --> 02:39:51,420
And yet we're taught that before the Antichrist comes, before the one-world governments in

2231
02:39:51,420 --> 02:39:56,140
place, before they start this law that says that if you won't worship the Antichrist,

2232
02:39:56,140 --> 02:39:57,140
you're gonna be killed.

2233
02:39:57,140 --> 02:40:01,020
You know, we're all gonna be out of here because they say, God would never allow his people

2234
02:40:01,020 --> 02:40:02,380
to go through something like that.

2235
02:40:02,380 --> 02:40:05,180
God loves us too much to allow us to suffer.

2236
02:40:05,180 --> 02:40:10,880
He would never allow us to go through tribulation, but yet every other generation of believers

2237
02:40:10,880 --> 02:40:11,880
have gone through tribulation.

2238
02:40:11,880 --> 02:40:16,260
Well, look at Paul, his job was to hunt down for the Sanhedrin, hunt down Christians.

2239
02:40:16,260 --> 02:40:20,460
And let me make it real clear, I do believe in the rapture, I'm not saying that the rapture

2240
02:40:20,460 --> 02:40:21,460
is a false god.

2241
02:40:21,460 --> 02:40:22,460
I know, they'll spin that too.

2242
02:40:22,460 --> 02:40:25,440
Yeah, this is what they'll do, you're saying there's no rapture.

2243
02:40:25,440 --> 02:40:29,940
Or they'll say, well, here's people before 1830 teaching that the rapture existed.

2244
02:40:29,940 --> 02:40:32,100
No, that's not what we're saying.

2245
02:40:32,100 --> 02:40:36,700
Before 1830, there was not a person on this planet who believed that the rapture came

2246
02:40:36,700 --> 02:40:39,440
after or before the tribulation.

2247
02:40:39,440 --> 02:40:43,300
The Bible says that the rapture happens after the tribulation.

2248
02:40:43,300 --> 02:40:44,620
That's when Christ comes in the clouds.

2249
02:40:44,620 --> 02:40:47,900
I wanna go to some, the point is the film covers all this.

2250
02:40:47,900 --> 02:40:50,180
And again, even if you're not a Christian, you need to see it.

2251
02:40:50,180 --> 02:40:55,940
It's very well done, because it explains why Christians will go along with anything now.

2252
02:40:55,940 --> 02:41:01,940
Well, you know what, and the film is important for a Christian and non-Christian alike.

2253
02:41:01,940 --> 02:41:06,380
First of all, if somebody's not a Christian, they need to watch the film and become a Christian,

2254
02:41:06,380 --> 02:41:09,140
because honestly, and that's explained at the end of the film.

2255
02:41:09,140 --> 02:41:13,060
But honestly, I don't understand how you can look around and see all these things happening

2256
02:41:13,060 --> 02:41:16,940
in the world today, and then look at the Bible and see that it's exactly what the Bible said

2257
02:41:16,940 --> 02:41:17,940
would happen, and then see-

2258
02:41:17,940 --> 02:41:21,540
Well, see, what I do is I just point out what the New World Order is doing, and I just say,

2259
02:41:21,540 --> 02:41:22,540
hey, you wanna see it?

2260
02:41:22,540 --> 02:41:24,200
And people will actually watch it.

2261
02:41:24,200 --> 02:41:28,100
My experience is you're gonna see this or go to hell, and they don't watch it, you know?

2262
02:41:28,100 --> 02:41:32,460
But here's the thing, even if you're not a Christian, I'm sure you have some Christian

2263
02:41:32,460 --> 02:41:37,900
friend who just refuses to wake up and refuses to understand what's going on with the global

2264
02:41:37,900 --> 02:41:41,220
government, the New World Order, the food supply, the water.

2265
02:41:41,220 --> 02:41:45,680
This film is the ultimate film for waking Christians up, because it's packed with Bible-

2266
02:41:45,680 --> 02:41:46,680
Well, look at Revelation.

2267
02:41:46,680 --> 02:41:53,040
It talks about the different passages, how the kings of the earth and the sorcerers manipulate

2268
02:41:53,040 --> 02:42:01,380
the pharmacia, the drugs, to drug the public and make us drunk on the blood of the innocents

2269
02:42:01,380 --> 02:42:04,900
Pepsi puts the dead baby parts in.

2270
02:42:04,900 --> 02:42:07,940
It's like the golden child, they're trying to get him to eat the bad things they can

2271
02:42:07,940 --> 02:42:10,060
like spiritually get at him.

2272
02:42:10,060 --> 02:42:15,100
But the point is they're sitting there point blank saying that they traffic in our souls.

2273
02:42:15,100 --> 02:42:16,240
That's what they want.

2274
02:42:16,240 --> 02:42:17,700
The globalists want our minds.

2275
02:42:17,700 --> 02:42:20,460
They're not after treasure and power, their minions are.

2276
02:42:20,460 --> 02:42:26,420
The high-level Luciferians aren't even into materialism, they want our souls.

2277
02:42:26,420 --> 02:42:27,520
Exactly right.

2278
02:42:27,520 --> 02:42:33,300
And this film, we spend about half the film just demolishing the pre-tribulation rapture

2279
02:42:33,300 --> 02:42:34,300
lie.

2280
02:42:34,300 --> 02:42:38,620
And that's like taking candy from a baby, because I mean, it's so clear in scripture.

2281
02:42:38,620 --> 02:42:42,460
And then we spend the other half of the film just explaining how this is all going to play

2282
02:42:42,460 --> 02:42:49,060
out and showing examples from now about the implantable chips, about the cashless society,

2283
02:42:49,060 --> 02:42:50,060
about-

2284
02:42:50,060 --> 02:42:51,060
How are they going in?

2285
02:42:51,060 --> 02:42:52,060
I mean, it's total control.

2286
02:42:52,060 --> 02:42:54,900
They're having police checkpoints with scanners.

2287
02:42:54,900 --> 02:42:59,820
I've got articles targeting, they know veterans off their license plate, scanned, no criminal

2288
02:42:59,820 --> 02:43:00,820
record.

2289
02:43:00,820 --> 02:43:04,260
The police are, this is a courtesy safety check, let me search your car without a warrant.

2290
02:43:04,260 --> 02:43:09,380
And then they're getting, in New York State, five felony counts facing 20 years in jail.

2291
02:43:09,380 --> 02:43:12,780
And they're saying, I'm a decorated veteran, I didn't even know that the law said this

2292
02:43:12,780 --> 02:43:13,780
was illegal.

2293
02:43:13,780 --> 02:43:16,020
They're like throwing the book at him saying, we're gonna get you.

2294
02:43:16,020 --> 02:43:18,660
I mean, they're going after good people now.

2295
02:43:18,660 --> 02:43:24,380
Oh, yeah, and all throughout the Bible, going back to the very beginning, Cain killed Abel.

2296
02:43:24,380 --> 02:43:26,700
All throughout the Bible, it's the bad guys killing the good people.

2297
02:43:26,700 --> 02:43:28,700
And evil wants high office to abuse.

2298
02:43:28,700 --> 02:43:29,700
Exactly.

2299
02:43:29,700 --> 02:43:33,860
And again, the whole Bible's about don't trust the government, stand up against it.

2300
02:43:33,860 --> 02:43:38,700
Romans 13 is totally taken out of context is why we sell the book, Romans 13, the true

2301
02:43:38,700 --> 02:43:43,120
meaning of submission by Chuck Baldwin and his constitutional lawyer's son breaks that

2302
02:43:43,120 --> 02:43:44,120
all down.

2303
02:43:44,120 --> 02:43:49,620
Every church I go to, it doesn't matter, Pentecostal, Evangelical, Baptist, my wife wants to go

2304
02:43:49,620 --> 02:43:50,620
to church.

2305
02:43:50,620 --> 02:43:53,820
You know, Christian friends, I go in, and at the end of the sermon, they go, we need

2306
02:43:53,820 --> 02:43:57,100
to do what the government says, and they're of the Lord, and there's gonna be some times

2307
02:43:57,100 --> 02:43:59,940
coming when the government needs to do some things, but it's of God.

2308
02:43:59,940 --> 02:44:03,140
And I know their clergy response team, and I go up and say, were you told to do that

2309
02:44:03,140 --> 02:44:04,980
by higher ups for FEMA?

2310
02:44:04,980 --> 02:44:08,580
I'm not gonna talk about that now, sonny boy there.

2311
02:44:08,580 --> 02:44:13,340
It's a federal agent there now, so devilish, so unconstitutional.

2312
02:44:13,340 --> 02:44:18,420
And they're not even bad men themselves, but they are now agents of the New World Order.

2313
02:44:18,420 --> 02:44:23,100
Well, you know, I actually used to attend a really big mega-type church, and when I

2314
02:44:23,100 --> 02:44:27,420
went to that really big church, the pastor was literally called to a meeting with George

2315
02:44:27,420 --> 02:44:31,460
W. Bush in Washington, DC, with a bunch of other big-time pastors.

2316
02:44:31,460 --> 02:44:35,460
And they sat him down and told him, we're on your team, you know, but you need to help

2317
02:44:35,460 --> 02:44:36,660
us, and here's what, you know.

2318
02:44:36,660 --> 02:44:40,300
And basically, these pastors are literally getting their marching orders from the government,

2319
02:44:40,300 --> 02:44:41,580
because the government's not stupid.

2320
02:44:41,580 --> 02:44:45,340
You know, they know that these big pastors that pastor really big churches-

2321
02:44:45,340 --> 02:44:46,580
It's over 100,000 now.

2322
02:44:46,580 --> 02:44:47,580
It's little ones.

2323
02:44:47,580 --> 02:44:48,580
I've got the manuals.

2324
02:44:48,580 --> 02:44:51,780
I'm sure you've seen our clergy response teams that we broke seven, eight years ago.

2325
02:44:51,780 --> 02:44:53,780
And since then, it's been declassified.

2326
02:44:53,780 --> 02:44:58,260
They've got them ready that when the time comes, turn your guns in, take the shots,

2327
02:44:58,260 --> 02:45:01,620
go to the camp, let them take your husband, it's of the Lord.

2328
02:45:01,620 --> 02:45:02,620
It's action.

2329
02:45:02,620 --> 02:45:04,140
And you know what's sad about that is that-

2330
02:45:04,140 --> 02:45:05,900
By the way, I'm not just saying that.

2331
02:45:05,900 --> 02:45:06,900
That's in the manuals.

2332
02:45:06,900 --> 02:45:07,900
Go ahead.

2333
02:45:07,900 --> 02:45:08,900
Oh, I know.

2334
02:45:08,900 --> 02:45:09,900
They plan on taking us away.

2335
02:45:09,900 --> 02:45:10,900
I've seen the evidence.

2336
02:45:10,900 --> 02:45:14,260
And the thing is, the thing that's sad about it, though, is that it turns a lot of people

2337
02:45:14,260 --> 02:45:19,300
off away from Christianity, because they see how basically a lot of these pastors are these

2338
02:45:19,300 --> 02:45:24,620
minions of the New World Order, and these minions of big government and global warfare

2339
02:45:24,620 --> 02:45:25,620
and all these different things-

2340
02:45:25,620 --> 02:45:26,620
Minions of the devil.

2341
02:45:26,620 --> 02:45:27,620
And minions of the devil.

2342
02:45:27,620 --> 02:45:31,160
And then they look at that, and it makes them turn against the Bible or turn against Jesus

2343
02:45:31,160 --> 02:45:35,260
Christ or not want to hear about it, when in reality, that's not the Bible or Jesus

2344
02:45:35,260 --> 02:45:36,260
talk.

2345
02:45:36,260 --> 02:45:37,620
And these guys don't know the Bible, you know?

2346
02:45:37,620 --> 02:45:41,020
And so if we could get some preachers that would stand up and preach what the Bible really

2347
02:45:41,020 --> 02:45:46,020
says, and warn people about these things, then maybe people would, you know-

2348
02:45:46,020 --> 02:45:47,020
I agree.

2349
02:45:47,020 --> 02:45:50,560
I'm going to go to, and again, people out there are Christians, like, how dare you even

2350
02:45:50,560 --> 02:45:51,700
talk about this?

2351
02:45:51,700 --> 02:45:52,700
What's wrong with talking?

2352
02:45:52,700 --> 02:45:54,300
See, this is the big taboo.

2353
02:45:54,300 --> 02:45:57,140
Let me tell all the Christians out there something.

2354
02:45:57,140 --> 02:46:01,100
In your life, if you've done the right thing and stood up against evil, God many times

2355
02:46:01,100 --> 02:46:03,940
will protect you, unless it's part of a larger plan.

2356
02:46:03,940 --> 02:46:06,500
I don't pray to God every day, hey, give me this, give me that, protect me.

2357
02:46:06,500 --> 02:46:12,420
I just say, look, I'm a sinner, I'm a dirty rag here, I'm trying to fight evil, my heart

2358
02:46:12,420 --> 02:46:13,420
loves good.

2359
02:46:13,420 --> 02:46:14,420
Will you help me be strong?

2360
02:46:14,420 --> 02:46:16,980
Will you help me not be a bad person?

2361
02:46:16,980 --> 02:46:20,100
There's all these Pharisees out there that want to make you obsess on the law, but not

2362
02:46:20,100 --> 02:46:21,140
the heart.

2363
02:46:21,140 --> 02:46:24,040
And the issue is, I'm going to tell Christians something out there.

2364
02:46:24,040 --> 02:46:27,900
You are not going to make it through this evil that's coming, believing you're going

2365
02:46:27,900 --> 02:46:29,260
to be teleported out of here.

2366
02:46:29,260 --> 02:46:31,460
I assure you, that's just not justice.

2367
02:46:31,460 --> 02:46:36,660
God is not going to let you sit there like a coward and be ejected out of this if you

2368
02:46:36,660 --> 02:46:38,260
don't stand up against evil.

2369
02:46:38,260 --> 02:46:42,400
I'm not saying God doesn't deliver people, but they have to go through the fire first.

2370
02:46:42,400 --> 02:46:44,340
Is that not biblical over and over again?

2371
02:46:44,340 --> 02:46:46,560
It's the same stories over and over again.

2372
02:46:46,560 --> 02:46:50,520
It's definitely biblical that every single Christian, according to the Bible, is appointed

2373
02:46:50,520 --> 02:46:54,060
to suffering, to go through trials, to go through tribulations.

2374
02:46:54,060 --> 02:46:55,420
You know, yeah, he's going to see us through.

2375
02:46:55,420 --> 02:46:58,740
The Bible says many of the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord deliver them out

2376
02:46:58,740 --> 02:46:59,740
of them all.

2377
02:46:59,740 --> 02:47:03,180
But it's not saying, you know, we're going to be delivered before the afflictions come.

2378
02:47:03,180 --> 02:47:04,180
You know, the Bible teaches...

2379
02:47:04,180 --> 02:47:05,180
What about Job?

2380
02:47:05,180 --> 02:47:07,020
You know, why did he just get delivered up front?

2381
02:47:07,020 --> 02:47:08,020
Exactly.

2382
02:47:08,020 --> 02:47:09,580
As Christians, we all have to fight.

2383
02:47:09,580 --> 02:47:12,220
And it's said he was as near perfect as any man.

2384
02:47:12,220 --> 02:47:15,940
He was the greatest man living on the earth at that time, is what the Bible says.

2385
02:47:15,940 --> 02:47:20,340
He was an upright man, and he went through the most suffering of anybody in the Bible.

2386
02:47:20,340 --> 02:47:21,340
Okay?

2387
02:47:21,340 --> 02:47:26,300
Because all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.

2388
02:47:26,300 --> 02:47:31,380
And Christians today, it's like you said, you know, the Christians today who don't see

2389
02:47:31,380 --> 02:47:35,420
this coming, they're not prepared for it, you know, it's going to catch them unawares.

2390
02:47:35,420 --> 02:47:37,060
It's going to catch them off guard.

2391
02:47:37,060 --> 02:47:38,060
They're going to panic.

2392
02:47:38,060 --> 02:47:39,060
They're going to be disillusioned.

2393
02:47:39,060 --> 02:47:43,320
You know, what happened to the rapture, I don't know what to do, I'm scared.

2394
02:47:43,320 --> 02:47:46,700
And you know, those of us that are awake, we're ready for it, you know?

2395
02:47:46,700 --> 02:47:52,140
They're already setting up checkpoints nationwide where they're looking for veterans, Christians,

2396
02:47:52,140 --> 02:47:56,380
landowners, second coming of Christ, believers, libertarians.

2397
02:47:56,380 --> 02:48:02,060
They know, I mean, the main homeland security and the same in Europe is for us.

2398
02:48:02,060 --> 02:48:05,620
I mean, there it is, these are really bad people.

2399
02:48:05,620 --> 02:48:10,220
I mean, I want to go to calls, we got a caller from Australia, he's been holding the longest.

2400
02:48:10,220 --> 02:48:12,940
I promise I'm going to get to you after the break, Sean, I'm going to give you time.

2401
02:48:12,940 --> 02:48:19,540
But John says he disagrees, he's listening on shortwave in Texas, WWCR World Service.

2402
02:48:19,540 --> 02:48:21,660
John, what do you disagree with, brother?

2403
02:48:21,660 --> 02:48:22,660
Hello?

2404
02:48:22,660 --> 02:48:23,660
Yes.

2405
02:48:23,660 --> 02:48:25,660
I'm approaching this conversation not hostile.

2406
02:48:25,660 --> 02:48:26,660
It's okay.

2407
02:48:26,660 --> 02:48:28,660
Tell us what you think, brother.

2408
02:48:28,660 --> 02:48:29,660
Okay.

2409
02:48:29,660 --> 02:48:32,300
I just didn't want you to understand I'm not coming at you hostile.

2410
02:48:32,300 --> 02:48:33,300
I don't mind that.

2411
02:48:33,300 --> 02:48:34,300
Go ahead.

2412
02:48:34,300 --> 02:48:35,300
Yes, sir.

2413
02:48:35,300 --> 02:48:45,500
In Pastor Anderson, in 2 Thessalonians chapter 3, or I'm sorry, chapter 2 verse 3, have you

2414
02:48:45,500 --> 02:48:48,060
ever read the Geneva Bible?

2415
02:48:48,060 --> 02:48:53,980
In that verse, they changed it in the Geneva Bible, and when they changed it in the King

2416
02:48:53,980 --> 02:48:59,260
James Version, they changed it to become a falling away.

2417
02:48:59,260 --> 02:49:02,420
And originally, it was a departing.

2418
02:49:02,420 --> 02:49:07,940
And that, to me, shows that there, you know, that there was, there has to be a departing

2419
02:49:07,940 --> 02:49:08,940
of something.

2420
02:49:08,940 --> 02:49:13,660
Okay, I've heard this theory that the falling away is actually a departure, meaning that

2421
02:49:13,660 --> 02:49:15,500
Christians are departing this earth.

2422
02:49:15,500 --> 02:49:18,260
The Greek word there is apostasia.

2423
02:49:18,260 --> 02:49:24,120
You actually expect me to believe that the Greek word apostasia should be translated

2424
02:49:24,120 --> 02:49:27,300
as departure, meaning departing in the rapture?

2425
02:49:27,300 --> 02:49:31,860
No, apostasy is when people fall away from the faith or depart from the faith.

2426
02:49:31,860 --> 02:49:35,620
The Bible says in the last days, some will depart from the faith.

2427
02:49:35,620 --> 02:49:40,540
Everyone knows a falling away means look at Europe, look at America, people, you know.

2428
02:49:40,540 --> 02:49:45,780
Look, I encourage you, the Greek word apostasia is where we get our English word apostasy.

2429
02:49:45,780 --> 02:49:50,400
And so when the Geneva Bible said a departure, it's talking about departing the faith.

2430
02:49:50,400 --> 02:49:53,200
Falling away means falling away from the truth.

2431
02:49:53,200 --> 02:49:55,020
And that's what we're seeing today, a lot of Christians.

2432
02:49:55,020 --> 02:49:58,380
How does the beast wage war on the saints and overcome them if there's, the Christians

2433
02:49:58,380 --> 02:49:59,380
are all gone?

2434
02:49:59,380 --> 02:50:05,260
But look, I've heard this so many times, wake up people, apostasy, apostasia, that is not

2435
02:50:05,260 --> 02:50:06,260
the rapture.

2436
02:50:06,260 --> 02:50:09,300
And look, this caller, I'm not trying to be rude to the caller, but this subject just

2437
02:50:09,300 --> 02:50:10,300
gets me fired up.

2438
02:50:10,300 --> 02:50:14,620
And let me tell you something, Christians today who believe in the pre-trib rapture,

2439
02:50:14,620 --> 02:50:17,500
this is the kind of ridiculous reasoning they use.

2440
02:50:17,500 --> 02:50:20,380
They're gonna take me to Second Thessalonians chapter 2 verse 3.

2441
02:50:20,380 --> 02:50:25,060
My gut in studying the world, they're planning to bring in world government and kill.

2442
02:50:25,060 --> 02:50:26,980
Their plan is over 90% of us, okay?

2443
02:50:26,980 --> 02:50:30,180
They're planning to kill people and they're a cultist and they're using microchips to

2444
02:50:30,180 --> 02:50:31,180
buy and sell.

2445
02:50:31,180 --> 02:50:32,540
I mean, it's on, folks.

2446
02:50:32,540 --> 02:50:35,860
So I'm here to tell you, all the Christians out there thinking you and your kids are getting

2447
02:50:35,860 --> 02:50:36,860
out of this.

2448
02:50:36,860 --> 02:50:41,140
There's none of you are getting out of this unless it means you die early before this

2449
02:50:41,140 --> 02:50:42,140
happens.

2450
02:50:42,140 --> 02:50:44,220
Okay, I got a warning for you right now.

2451
02:50:44,220 --> 02:50:45,220
You can put it in the bank.

2452
02:50:45,220 --> 02:50:47,940
Okay, you can put it in a pipe and smoke it.

2453
02:50:47,940 --> 02:50:52,100
Nobody, and I mean nobody rides for free.

2454
02:50:52,100 --> 02:50:54,700
Nobody's going in the kingdom of heaven without showing their metal.

2455
02:50:54,700 --> 02:50:57,940
The fire separates the garbage from the gold.

2456
02:50:57,940 --> 02:50:59,620
I'm gonna go back to that caller.

2457
02:50:59,620 --> 02:51:00,620
Stay there, sir.

2458
02:51:00,620 --> 02:51:02,020
I wanna give you a response back, John.

2459
02:51:02,020 --> 02:51:05,780
If you've ever wanted one of our best selling generators, but we're waiting for an offer

2460
02:51:05,780 --> 02:51:10,700
so crazy you couldn't refuse, then you're not gonna wanna miss this exciting message.

2461
02:51:10,700 --> 02:51:11,700
Here's why.

2462
02:51:11,700 --> 02:51:17,020
Our solar generators provide life-saving electrical power, and unlike gas generators, solar generators

2463
02:51:17,020 --> 02:51:21,420
run quietly, emit no fumes, and produce electricity from the sun.

2464
02:51:21,420 --> 02:51:24,700
So when the lights go out, you'll always have the power you need.

2465
02:51:24,700 --> 02:51:26,460
Now, here's the best part.

2466
02:51:26,460 --> 02:51:31,140
Every year, we accumulate a few solar generators that we just can't sell as new.

2467
02:51:31,140 --> 02:51:36,320
We put them in a special spot in our warehouse, and we discount them heavily at the end of

2468
02:51:36,320 --> 02:51:37,320
each year.

2469
02:51:37,320 --> 02:51:41,060
We call them scratch and dent units, but they're really just like new.

2470
02:51:41,060 --> 02:51:46,260
Each unit comes with a full factory warranty and special bonuses you just won't believe.

2471
02:51:46,260 --> 02:51:47,260
Don't wait.

2472
02:51:47,260 --> 02:51:48,260
They go fast.

2473
02:51:48,260 --> 02:51:51,700
Go to scratchanddentsolar.com, that's scratchanddentsolar.com.

2474
02:51:51,700 --> 02:52:01,660
For the craziest offer we've ever made, go to scratchanddentsolar.com, that's scratchanddentsolar.com.

2475
02:52:01,660 --> 02:52:03,900
It's time for a home security quiz.

2476
02:52:03,900 --> 02:52:04,900
Answer this.

2477
02:52:04,900 --> 02:52:09,420
What effective home security device is smaller than a coffee cup fakes up burglars into thinking

2478
02:52:09,420 --> 02:52:14,360
someone is home at your house while you're away, plugs into any wall outlet, is recommended

2479
02:52:14,360 --> 02:52:17,940
by many police departments, and sells for less than $35?

2480
02:52:17,940 --> 02:52:20,580
Yes, it's fake TV.

2481
02:52:20,580 --> 02:52:24,980
This year, about one in every 50 U.S. homes will have a break-in, with burglars usually

2482
02:52:24,980 --> 02:52:29,440
picking the easy target, a dark house that looks like no one is home.

2483
02:52:29,440 --> 02:52:34,340
Fake TV is a small electronic security device that makes it look like someone is home watching

2484
02:52:34,340 --> 02:52:37,420
TV by simulating the light from a real TV.

2485
02:52:37,420 --> 02:52:40,420
It's like a lamp on a timer, but far more convincing.

2486
02:52:40,420 --> 02:52:45,140
And for only $34.95, fake TV could be the difference between coming home to a secure

2487
02:52:45,140 --> 02:52:47,440
house or one that's been ransacked.

2488
02:52:47,440 --> 02:52:58,580
Go to faketv.com or call 1-877-5FAKETV, that's 877-532-5388, or go to faketv.com.

2489
02:52:58,580 --> 02:53:01,480
Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.

2490
02:53:01,480 --> 02:53:05,740

2491

2506
02:54:11,220 --> 02:54:15,960
By the way, everything we've talked about unfortunately is now starting to unfold.

2507
02:54:15,960 --> 02:54:19,240
And all over the country, they're getting Homeland Security grants starting with New

2508
02:54:19,240 --> 02:54:20,920
York and LA.

2509
02:54:20,920 --> 02:54:25,240
They now have naked body scanners that the police force people into on the street randomly.

2510
02:54:25,240 --> 02:54:30,420
They're doing something like half a million a year random searches without warrants.

2511
02:54:30,420 --> 02:54:35,860
Now that's up at infowars.com in New York, and now they're having warrantless checkpoints

2512
02:54:35,860 --> 02:54:36,860
here in Texas.

2513
02:54:36,860 --> 02:54:39,040
I mean, this is just unbelievable.

2514
02:54:39,040 --> 02:54:45,880
Engineer files lawsuit against New York Street body scanners, violation of the Fourth Amendment.

2515
02:54:45,880 --> 02:54:46,880
It's just incredible.

2516
02:54:46,880 --> 02:54:49,280
MSNBC urges viewers to boycott gun manufacturers.

2517
02:54:49,280 --> 02:54:52,400
I mean, this is a full racketeering operation.

2518
02:54:52,400 --> 02:54:57,680
McCain and Schumer moved to force Americans to use biometric ID for employment.

2519
02:54:57,680 --> 02:55:01,820
After the tribulation sneak peek, got the trailer up there, Department of Homeland Security

2520
02:55:01,820 --> 02:55:08,800
targets gun collector, decorated combat veteran arrested, charged with five felonies for possession

2521
02:55:08,800 --> 02:55:11,700
of AR-15 magazines in New York State.

2522
02:55:11,700 --> 02:55:12,700
Now illegal.

2523
02:55:12,700 --> 02:55:14,600
They say they're gonna throw him under the jail.

2524
02:55:14,600 --> 02:55:18,080
This is how they're gonna come after us, folks, and it is pure evil.

2525
02:55:18,080 --> 02:55:21,960
And we can be like Nineveh, I believe, and get a reprieve if we push this back.

2526
02:55:21,960 --> 02:55:26,680
I had a sheriff on the one in Kentucky who's now got hundreds of sheriffs by his honor

2527
02:55:26,680 --> 02:55:30,000
going public saying, I won't enforce this, I'm gonna stand against the gun confiscation.

2528
02:55:30,000 --> 02:55:33,640
Now hundreds, prominent ones are coming out saying they stand with him.

2529
02:55:33,640 --> 02:55:38,440
He said, look, he said, we might have had all this happen in the 70s when people stood

2530
02:55:38,440 --> 02:55:39,440
up.

2531
02:55:39,440 --> 02:55:40,440
It would have had to happen last year.

2532
02:55:40,440 --> 02:55:43,040
We're in the game, folks, and it's all in the Bible.

2533
02:55:43,040 --> 02:55:47,120
Whether you believe it or not, it's amazing philosophy, amazing information.

2534
02:55:47,120 --> 02:55:50,840
The media puts it down all day because they're scared of it.

2535
02:55:50,840 --> 02:55:54,400
And read the Bible and tell me, how did it predict all this with such precision?

2536
02:55:54,400 --> 02:55:56,880
I wanna go to Sean in Australia who's holding super patient.

2537
02:55:56,880 --> 02:55:58,360
I promise I'm gonna get to you.

2538
02:55:58,360 --> 02:56:03,020
But John in Texas who disagrees, the pastor got fired up there with you, you're very nice

2539
02:56:03,020 --> 02:56:04,020
to call in.

2540
02:56:04,020 --> 02:56:06,160
Do you wanna have a counterpoint back to him?

2541
02:56:06,160 --> 02:56:09,080
Yes, yes, thank you.

2542
02:56:09,080 --> 02:56:15,880
Pastor Anderson, have you ever read the book, Why So Many Churches by Dr. Noah Hutchings?

2543
02:56:15,880 --> 02:56:18,880
The reason I'm bringing this up is because I believe that-

2544
02:56:18,880 --> 02:56:22,440
I've read it, everybody fights over doctrine until everything splits.

2545
02:56:22,440 --> 02:56:23,440
Exactly.

2546
02:56:23,440 --> 02:56:25,720
And I don't have a bone to pick either way on this side.

2547
02:56:25,720 --> 02:56:29,560
If we're raptured out of here, I'm happy, I just know I'm insecure in Christ.

2548
02:56:29,560 --> 02:56:30,560
That's where I'm coming from.

2549
02:56:30,560 --> 02:56:34,060
No, no, I think that's key, but we need to be fighting this thing.

2550
02:56:34,060 --> 02:56:36,440
Because what matters is people's souls.

2551
02:56:36,440 --> 02:56:37,440
Go ahead, Pastor.

2552
02:56:37,440 --> 02:56:38,440
Comments?

2553
02:56:38,440 --> 02:56:43,000
Well, I appreciate the call and I'm sorry that I got a little fired up there, it's just

2554
02:56:43,000 --> 02:56:44,920
I'm really passionate about this.

2555
02:56:44,920 --> 02:56:46,560
Falling away means falling down, not up.

2556
02:56:46,560 --> 02:56:48,760
Yeah, if things fall, they fall down, they don't fall down.

2557
02:56:48,760 --> 02:56:50,400
We're not gonna be raptured to the center of the earth.

2558
02:56:50,400 --> 02:56:54,780
So the apostasia or falling away or departure is not the rapture.

2559
02:56:54,780 --> 02:56:58,360
But as far as the idea of not fighting over doctrine, I disagree with that.

2560
02:56:58,360 --> 02:57:00,460
I haven't read the book, I can't comment on it.

2561
02:57:00,460 --> 02:57:04,840
But I'm gonna fight over doctrine until I die, because I do want to fight over every

2562
02:57:04,840 --> 02:57:05,840
little doctrine.

2563
02:57:05,840 --> 02:57:08,360
Because if it wasn't important, it wouldn't have been in the Bible.

2564
02:57:08,360 --> 02:57:12,080
And let me tell you something, it's the New World Order that wants to unite everybody.

2565
02:57:12,080 --> 02:57:13,640
Have you known World Council of Churches?

2566
02:57:13,640 --> 02:57:16,740
Yeah, they want to unite all the churches, World Council of Churches.

2567
02:57:16,740 --> 02:57:18,400
They want the Baptist- Ecumenical.

2568
02:57:18,400 --> 02:57:23,200
Ecumenicalism, they want the Baptist, the Methodist, Presbyterian, Catholic, Mormon,

2569
02:57:23,200 --> 02:57:24,200
Jehovah's Witness.

2570
02:57:24,200 --> 02:57:25,920
They want them all to join up.

2571
02:57:25,920 --> 02:57:26,920
That's the New World Order.

2572
02:57:26,920 --> 02:57:27,920
Let's go to Australia real quick.

2573
02:57:27,920 --> 02:57:30,640
John in Australia, thanks for holding her on the air.

2574
02:57:30,640 --> 02:57:32,640
Alex, how are you?

2575
02:57:32,640 --> 02:57:37,800
Look, I want to speak to another book, another book written by Carol Quigley that I'm sure

2576
02:57:37,800 --> 02:57:39,360
you're familiar with, Tragedy and Hope.

2577
02:57:39,360 --> 02:57:40,360
Yes, sir.

2578
02:57:40,360 --> 02:57:45,440
There's actually a passage in there that actually gives you the historical framework for understanding

2579
02:57:45,440 --> 02:57:51,840
why weapons are needed in times of human civilization when there is enemies.

2580
02:57:51,840 --> 02:57:58,160
Now, if you give me just five minutes to read it, you can use this against anyone who argues

2581
02:57:58,160 --> 02:57:59,160
against you.

2582
02:57:59,160 --> 02:58:00,160
No, no.

2583
02:58:00,160 --> 02:58:02,680
We're going to go to overdrive in a moment, but go ahead and tell people the passage,

2584
02:58:02,680 --> 02:58:03,680
the page.

2585
02:58:03,680 --> 02:58:06,840
We even sell Tragedy and Hope, it's like 1,100 pages long.

2586
02:58:06,840 --> 02:58:11,920
This is top globalist admitting the whole program, Bill Clinton's mentor at Georgetown.

2587
02:58:11,920 --> 02:58:15,520
Give people the passage and page number, we'll come back and let you read it on air.

2588
02:58:15,520 --> 02:58:16,520
No worries.

2589
02:58:16,520 --> 02:58:20,920
Okay, I actually don't have the page number, I've just got to print it out right now.

2590
02:58:20,920 --> 02:58:24,760
No, I understand, but I'm saying if you give me the page number, I can actually go grab

2591
02:58:24,760 --> 02:58:30,880
the book right over there on the bookshelf and then show people, give me a couple words

2592
02:58:30,880 --> 02:58:35,600
out of it and then I can go to the, give me a name out of it and then I can go look up

2593
02:58:35,600 --> 02:58:38,360
the page number in the back of the book.

2594
02:58:38,360 --> 02:58:39,360
Stay there, we'll be right back.

2595
02:58:39,360 --> 02:58:40,360

2597
02:58:52,000 --> 02:58:56,840
Looking back on 2012, I know personally I'm thanking God that my family and I made it

2598
02:58:56,840 --> 02:59:00,800
through the year from natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer

2599
02:59:00,800 --> 02:59:04,360
drought to the family hardships brought on by a disastrous economy.

2600
02:59:04,360 --> 02:59:06,700
Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything.

2601
02:59:06,700 --> 02:59:10,880
My friends at eFoods Direct hear from customers every day that are fortunate to weather life's

2602
02:59:10,880 --> 02:59:13,120
storm by having a supply of food on hand.

2603
02:59:13,120 --> 02:59:17,560
Danny from New York City wrote in following Hurricane Sandy and said, almost all the grocery

2604
02:59:17,560 --> 02:59:21,560
stores are closed, but I managed to get my eFoods just in time to be able to help my

2605
02:59:21,560 --> 02:59:22,720
sister and my niece.

2606
02:59:22,720 --> 02:59:26,800
Bottom line, it's better to be prepared 10 years too early than one day too late.

2607
02:59:26,800 --> 02:59:29,480
Feed common sense as warning and do what I've done.

Coast to coast, direct from Austin.

2615
02:59:56,520 --> 03:00:06,640
You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.

2616
03:00:06,640 --> 03:00:11,480
Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.

2617
03:00:11,480 --> 03:00:12,480
You want answers?

2618
03:00:12,480 --> 03:00:14,600
Well, so does he.

2619
03:00:14,600 --> 03:00:18,840
He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.

2620
03:00:18,840 --> 03:00:23,040
And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.

2621
03:00:23,040 --> 03:00:26,840
All right, ladies and gentlemen, I was talking to Pastor Anderson.

2622
03:00:26,840 --> 03:00:31,520
He listens to us on XM 166, and they carry three hours that they come in at the second

2623
03:00:31,520 --> 03:00:33,760
hour to the second, third, and fourth hour.

2624
03:00:33,760 --> 03:00:37,680
For a while, I was doing four hours.

2625
03:00:37,680 --> 03:00:41,880
And a lot of days, we do do the fourth hour, and here we are doing it.

2626
03:00:41,880 --> 03:00:45,440
But we're talking to Sean in Australia.

2627
03:00:45,440 --> 03:00:48,220
This is about a five-minute segment, so you've got the floor.

2628
03:00:48,220 --> 03:00:51,480
Go ahead and read from Carol Quigley's Tragedy and Hope.

2629
03:00:51,480 --> 03:00:53,000
And then, guys, I don't see one over there.

2630
03:00:53,000 --> 03:00:55,400
Will you guys run me one in from the shipping department?

2631
03:00:55,400 --> 03:00:56,400
Thank you.

2632
03:00:56,400 --> 03:00:57,400
So, Sean, you've got four minutes.

2633
03:00:57,400 --> 03:00:58,400
Start reading.

2634
03:00:58,400 --> 03:01:02,840
Okay, so firstly, Colin, you've got to understand that this book was actually intended for the

2635
03:01:02,840 --> 03:01:05,560
intellectual community and for the elites themselves.

2636
03:01:05,560 --> 03:01:09,280
They never actually, really, it was never targeted for the general population.

2637
03:01:09,280 --> 03:01:12,360
So the general population can now use this as the weapon.

2638
03:01:12,360 --> 03:01:17,880
Yeah, this was a control manual for globalists to understand why they were left and right,

2639
03:01:17,880 --> 03:01:19,880
how they created the synthesis.

2640
03:01:19,880 --> 03:01:21,640
Go ahead.

2641
03:01:21,640 --> 03:01:25,080
Okay, so this is directly reading.

2642
03:01:25,080 --> 03:01:30,840
It's on the military level in Western civilization, the 20th century, that chief development has

2643
03:01:30,840 --> 03:01:35,640
been a steady increase in the complexity and the cost of weapons.

2644
03:01:35,640 --> 03:01:40,240
Weapons are cheap and easy to get and so easy to use that almost anyone can use them after

2645
03:01:40,240 --> 03:01:42,120
a short period of training.

2646
03:01:42,120 --> 03:01:46,400
Armies are generally made up of large masses of amateur soldiers.

2647
03:01:46,400 --> 03:01:52,160
Such weapons we call amateur weapons and such armies we might call mass armies of citizen

2648
03:01:52,160 --> 03:01:53,400
soldiers.

2649
03:01:53,400 --> 03:01:58,800
The age of Pericles in classical Greece and the 19th century in Western civilization were

2650
03:01:58,800 --> 03:02:05,080
periods of amateur weapons and citizen soldiers, but the 19th century was preceded, as was

2651
03:02:05,080 --> 03:02:10,640
the age of Pericles also, by a period in which weapons were expensive and required long training

2652
03:02:10,640 --> 03:02:12,200
in their use.

2653
03:02:12,200 --> 03:02:17,520
Such weapons we call specialist weapons, periods of specialist weapons are generally periods

2654
03:02:17,520 --> 03:02:20,200
of small armies of professional soldiers.

2655
03:02:20,200 --> 03:02:25,200
In a period of specialist weapons, the minority who have such weapons can usually force the

2656
03:02:25,200 --> 03:02:31,640
majority who lack them to obey, thus a period of specialist weapons tends to give rise to

2657
03:02:31,640 --> 03:02:37,120
a period of minority rule and authoritarian government, but a period of amateur weapons

2658
03:02:37,120 --> 03:02:41,000
is a period in which all men are roughly equal in military power.

2659
03:02:41,000 --> 03:02:46,960
A majority can compel a minority to yield and a majority rule or even democratic government

2660
03:02:46,960 --> 03:02:47,960
tends to rise.

2661
03:02:47,960 --> 03:02:52,880
So what you've got to realize here in this passage is he refers to specialist weapons.

2662
03:02:52,880 --> 03:02:54,040
Think about what we have right now.

2663
03:02:54,040 --> 03:02:57,880
We have Skynet, total lockdown of the skies.

2664
03:02:57,880 --> 03:03:01,140
We have specialist weapons, they're called drones.

2665
03:03:01,140 --> 03:03:05,920
We have the specialist weapons against us against our health, it's called eugenics.

2666
03:03:05,920 --> 03:03:08,520
So why do we need weapons?

2667
03:03:08,520 --> 03:03:13,440
Because as we all know it's not for hunting, it's to actually equalize power.

2668
03:03:13,440 --> 03:03:21,120
Now Carol Quigley characterizes that periods of specialist weapons which we are currently

2669
03:03:21,120 --> 03:03:27,520
in today, the present, 2013, it's a period of specialist weapons, tend to give rise to

2670
03:03:27,520 --> 03:03:30,560
a period of minority rule and authoritarian government.

2671
03:03:30,560 --> 03:03:32,920
Now the term authoritarian is actually incorrect.

2672
03:03:32,920 --> 03:03:34,560
Alex also uses it a lot.

2673
03:03:34,560 --> 03:03:38,880
You should actually refer to it as totalitarian government.

2674
03:03:38,880 --> 03:03:44,920
Now this totalitarian government is also in tandem with programs such as Agenda 21 and

2675
03:03:44,920 --> 03:03:50,000
everything like that and the underlying ideology of this I would actually like to speak to.

2676
03:03:50,000 --> 03:03:55,400
Alex was just talking before about how the elite or whatever you want to call them, worship

2677
03:03:55,400 --> 03:04:00,680
a specific religion, they worship certain ideologies.

2678
03:04:00,680 --> 03:04:06,520
They have basically, they recruit people into their organization through what I call the

2679
03:04:06,520 --> 03:04:12,280
most extreme form of nepotism where they actually recruit people based on their ideologies alone.

2680
03:04:12,280 --> 03:04:18,840
Now the undercurrent of ideology through all sciences, especially earth or environmental

2681
03:04:18,840 --> 03:04:23,360
sciences is actually something called conservatism.

2682
03:04:23,360 --> 03:04:29,320
The overwhelming belief from the scientific community is that the universe is entropic.

2683
03:04:29,320 --> 03:04:35,960
That means that with time, the universe eventually dies of a so-called heat death but if we look

2684
03:04:35,960 --> 03:04:40,640
at anything, anything in history, we actually see counter-entropic development.

2685
03:04:40,640 --> 03:04:42,000
Hey sir, let me stop you.

2686
03:04:42,000 --> 03:04:45,600
I've actually got the book here and its bibliography is big but not big enough.

2687
03:04:45,600 --> 03:04:49,240
I'm not finding the, I remember reading this many years ago.

2688
03:04:49,240 --> 03:04:50,440
Tell me where you found it.

2689
03:04:50,440 --> 03:04:55,200
Send your link to showtipsninfoawars.com or give me the basic page number because I want

2690
03:04:55,200 --> 03:04:56,760
to show TV viewers this.

2691
03:04:56,760 --> 03:04:57,760
You're right.

2692
03:04:57,760 --> 03:04:58,760
This is big news.

2693
03:04:58,760 --> 03:04:59,760
I'm going to come back to you.

2694
03:04:59,760 --> 03:05:00,760
Hello, I'm Alex Jones.

2695
03:05:00,760 --> 03:05:09,760
Myself, my family, the infoawars.com team want to relay to you and your families that

2696
03:05:09,760 --> 03:05:14,760
we are intensifying our efforts against the globalist on every front.

2697
03:05:14,760 --> 03:05:20,400
Infoawars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats but we can't do that without

2698
03:05:20,400 --> 03:05:21,400
your help.

2699
03:05:21,400 --> 03:05:26,640
By getting the films, bumper stickers and t-shirts at infoawars.com, you will wake up

2700
03:05:26,640 --> 03:05:32,680
people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.

2701
03:05:32,680 --> 03:05:36,140
We need your help to spread the word like never before.

2702
03:05:36,140 --> 03:05:42,360
They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.

2703
03:05:42,360 --> 03:05:49,800
You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization

2704
03:05:49,800 --> 03:05:51,360
and ultimate extermination.

2705
03:05:51,360 --> 03:05:53,720
The war is here.

2706
03:05:53,720 --> 03:05:55,560
It's an info war.

2707
03:05:55,560 --> 03:06:01,840
The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.

2708
03:06:01,840 --> 03:06:02,840
My name is Steven Huir.

2709
03:06:02,840 --> 03:06:06,960
After 22 years of nutritional counseling, I've observed that most brain malfunctions

2710
03:06:06,960 --> 03:06:10,280
have at their roots some form of toxicity and brain damage.

2711
03:06:10,280 --> 03:06:14,140
So whether it is poor memory, poor focus, lack of creative thinking or more serious

2712
03:06:14,140 --> 03:06:18,640
matters like inability to focus, speak normally or remember things, the emphasis to getting

2713
03:06:18,640 --> 03:06:22,320
one's brain working optimally needs to be on detoxification.

2714
03:06:22,320 --> 03:06:26,720
One World Way supports your body's number one means of detoxification, which is glutathione

2715
03:06:26,720 --> 03:06:27,720
production.

2716
03:06:27,720 --> 03:06:31,760
My name is Angie and my son has suffered from borderline autism and constipation.

2717
03:06:31,760 --> 03:06:36,200
I got him on One World Way and in two months his constipation is gone.

2718
03:06:36,200 --> 03:06:40,680
He has become friendlier, he can carry on a normal conversation with me and he has made

2719
03:06:40,680 --> 03:06:41,680
his first friend.

2720
03:06:41,680 --> 03:06:45,720
He's doing great and he looks forward to taking One World Way every day.

2721
03:06:45,720 --> 03:06:50,680
You could offer him a present or a cake and he would prefer the One World Way.

2722
03:06:50,680 --> 03:07:02,800
Go to Oneworldway.com, that's Oneworldway.com or call 888-988-3325, that's 888-988-3325.

2723
03:07:02,800 --> 03:07:06,800
In this unpredictable world, disaster can strike anyone.

2724
03:07:06,800 --> 03:07:13,060
That's why an essential part of any emergency survival plan must be stove in a can.

2725
03:07:13,060 --> 03:07:18,000

03:08:03,560 --> 03:08:10,120
From his Central Texas command center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.

2736
03:08:10,120 --> 03:08:16,160
It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

2737
03:08:16,160 --> 03:08:18,600
Ladies and gentlemen, we're going back to Sean in Australia.

2738
03:08:18,600 --> 03:08:23,560
If you just joined us, he brought up a tragedy and hope written by the head of political

2739
03:08:23,560 --> 03:08:26,720
science at one time at Georgetown University.

2740
03:08:26,720 --> 03:08:31,320
That's where the globalists send their people to get the inside scoop.

2741
03:08:31,320 --> 03:08:36,840
And only 1,000 copies of this book were originally printed back in the mid-1960s to be given

2742
03:08:36,840 --> 03:08:40,440
to the CIA section chief, State Department people.

2743
03:08:40,440 --> 03:08:47,800
It was commissioned over a decade by the Carnegie and Rockefeller Foundations, Quigley later

2744
03:08:47,800 --> 03:08:50,160
when this came out, had to admit that.

2745
03:08:50,160 --> 03:08:54,280
And he brags in the book, actually, that he was commissioned and allowed into the Annals,

2746
03:08:54,280 --> 03:08:57,200
the Bilderberg Group, and others.

2747
03:08:57,200 --> 03:08:59,560
And he says, I believe this should be an open conspiracy.

2748
03:08:59,560 --> 03:09:02,840
It's a great idea to have world government to engineer everybody.

2749
03:09:02,840 --> 03:09:06,240
And the book is, let me tell you how many pages long.

2750
03:09:06,240 --> 03:09:11,160
It's over 1,350 pages long.

2751
03:09:11,160 --> 03:09:13,480
Now the plates got out.

2752
03:09:13,480 --> 03:09:18,080
And Patriot groups associated with the John Birch Society and others printed tens of thousands

2753
03:09:18,080 --> 03:09:20,280
of these up in the 70s.

2754
03:09:20,280 --> 03:09:25,600
And there were even threats of legal actions and things, but the point is they backed off.

2755
03:09:25,600 --> 03:09:27,480
And we found the publisher that republished it.

2756
03:09:27,480 --> 03:09:31,400
We do, I wasn't getting to sell the book today, but the caller from Australia called in and

2757
03:09:31,400 --> 03:09:37,360
said, have you read what's on page 1,200, The Unfolding of Time?

2758
03:09:37,360 --> 03:09:43,640
And I'm gonna show view, and it's also in chapter two, The Unfolding of Time, but also

2759
03:09:43,640 --> 03:09:47,340
in chapter two, they say similar things.

2760
03:09:47,340 --> 03:09:51,920
And yes, I read most of this book, I'm gonna be honest with you, it's 1,300 pages long.

2761
03:09:51,920 --> 03:09:56,680
I read most of it back in about 1996, and a few years ago, I tried to read it again.

2762
03:09:56,680 --> 03:09:58,900
I'm gonna be honest, I haven't read the whole thing.

2763
03:09:58,900 --> 03:10:02,440
But the whole deal is how we control the left and the right, we want there to be the illusion

2764
03:10:02,440 --> 03:10:03,440
of choice.

2765
03:10:03,440 --> 03:10:06,960
We wanna bankrupt people, make them dependent, only we'll be able to operate.

2766
03:10:06,960 --> 03:10:09,820
We like fascism, we like socialism, we like communism.

2767
03:10:09,820 --> 03:10:14,600
As long as it centralizes, we hate libertarianism, we hate freedom cuz it makes people uppity.

2768
03:10:14,600 --> 03:10:18,340
And this caller was bringing this up, and I remember reading this when he was saying

2769
03:10:18,340 --> 03:10:24,120
it, I knew he wasn't lying because I had the remnants of the memory of that.

2770
03:10:24,120 --> 03:10:25,960
I guess that's what the beginning of wisdom is.

2771
03:10:25,960 --> 03:10:28,120
You don't remember it all, you just remember pieces.

2772
03:10:28,120 --> 03:10:29,880
You know the person's being accurate.

2773
03:10:29,880 --> 03:10:33,940
And he says right here, we don't want the general public having arms because it makes

2774
03:10:33,940 --> 03:10:36,520
it a free society and we can't stand up against them.

2775
03:10:36,520 --> 03:10:40,140
We want specialized armies to basically oppress them.

2776
03:10:40,140 --> 03:10:44,480
And he goes on to talk about how basically the founders wanted a citizen army in Western

2777
03:10:44,480 --> 03:10:48,040
civilization and freedom, and they don't want that.

2778
03:10:48,040 --> 03:10:51,960
And the caller's like, this will defeat the gun control debate.

2779
03:10:51,960 --> 03:10:54,960
Point out the tyrants want our guns, well, that is what's defeating them.

2780
03:10:54,960 --> 03:10:58,640
Sure, you could argue let's put mentally ill people in a registry so they can't own a gun.

2781
03:10:58,640 --> 03:10:59,640
They already have that.

2782
03:10:59,640 --> 03:11:04,640
Adam Lanza tried to buy guns five times, he failed, okay?

2783
03:11:04,640 --> 03:11:07,480
So they don't care, they want our guns.

2784
03:11:07,480 --> 03:11:11,600
They're gonna use anything reasonable to enslave us, they're not reasonable.

2785
03:11:11,600 --> 03:11:14,440
So their reason to want our guns is to enslave us.

2786
03:11:14,440 --> 03:11:18,800
They're arming to the teeth while telling us it's bad for us to have any guns.

2787
03:11:18,800 --> 03:11:25,740
I wanna go back to Pastor, who's here in studio with us today, and he's got the new, well,

2788
03:11:25,740 --> 03:11:30,160
he's part of the new film, Pastor Anderson, Let No Man Deceive You After the Tribulation

2789
03:11:30,160 --> 03:11:31,360
film.

2790
03:11:31,360 --> 03:11:38,280
What is your take on this Carol Quigley passage and what the caller was raising?

2791
03:11:38,280 --> 03:11:41,000
Well, it's all part of the same agenda.

2792
03:11:41,000 --> 03:11:45,080
In order to totally enslave people, you're gonna have to take away their guns, you're

2793
03:11:45,080 --> 03:11:46,320
gonna have to take away their weapons.

2794
03:11:46,320 --> 03:11:52,320
The Bible clearly says that the Antichrist is gonna make war with the saints and overcome

2795
03:11:52,320 --> 03:11:53,320
them.

2796
03:11:53,320 --> 03:11:54,320
Well, how's he gonna do that?

2797
03:11:54,320 --> 03:12:00,760
Obviously, he's gonna put us in a society where we have no freedom, where we're completely

2798
03:12:00,760 --> 03:12:04,000
controlled, completely surveilled, we're not gonna have any weapons, we're not gonna be

2799
03:12:04,000 --> 03:12:05,440
able to defend ourselves.

2800
03:12:05,440 --> 03:12:09,680
And that's why the Bible tells us that Christians are gonna be beheaded en masse because of

2801
03:12:09,680 --> 03:12:12,400
the fact that the government's gonna have the control to carry out that.

2802
03:12:12,400 --> 03:12:19,320
The TV preacher told me that Scottie's on the Enterprise is gonna beat me up.

2803
03:12:19,320 --> 03:12:21,760
That's about as true as Star Trek is true.

2804
03:12:21,760 --> 03:12:26,580
You know, I mean, the idea of the rapture taking place before the tribulation is about

2805
03:12:26,580 --> 03:12:31,880
as biblical as the Starship Enterprise picking us up before the tribulation.

2806
03:12:31,880 --> 03:12:32,880
All right, I wanna go back-

2807
03:12:32,880 --> 03:12:33,880
Number one is found in scripture.

2808
03:12:33,880 --> 03:12:37,080
I wanna go back to the caller, but if you just join us, I'm gonna read the passage from

2809
03:12:37,080 --> 03:12:40,700
page 1,200 that the caller was raising.

2810
03:12:40,700 --> 03:12:46,680
When weapons are of the amateur type of the 1880s, as they were in Greece in the 5th century

2811
03:12:46,680 --> 03:12:51,640
BC, they are widely possessed by citizens' power is similarly dispersed.

2812
03:12:51,640 --> 03:12:54,520
So dispersed power is everybody being armed.

2813
03:12:54,520 --> 03:12:55,520
And that sound good?

2814
03:12:55,520 --> 03:13:02,440
No, the UN says they want the abolition of civilian ownership of firearms, quote, because

2815
03:13:02,440 --> 03:13:07,720
it threatens a legitimate power monopoly of the state, UN treaty on general, small arms

2816
03:13:07,720 --> 03:13:14,520
assignment, ratified and accepted for full attempted passage at the full UN assembly,

2817
03:13:14,520 --> 03:13:16,600
July 7th, 2001.

2818
03:13:16,600 --> 03:13:21,000
I mean, this is their plan, they say, cuz they know people aren't reading what they're

2819
03:13:21,000 --> 03:13:22,000
saying.

2820
03:13:22,000 --> 03:13:24,800
I mean, they're like, we're gonna enslave these people, we're gonna cut their food off

2821
03:13:24,800 --> 03:13:26,040
so we can sterilize whoever we want.

2822
03:13:26,040 --> 03:13:29,040
Once we got them all on welfare, they'll all be social engineered.

2823
03:13:29,040 --> 03:13:31,080
We can just give them shots to kill their butt.

2824
03:13:31,080 --> 03:13:34,080
But we wanna kill them over a couple years, they don't know we killed them.

2825
03:13:34,080 --> 03:13:36,640
But then the Africans know to run at the villages when the UN shows up.

2826
03:13:36,640 --> 03:13:37,960
Let's continue.

2827
03:13:37,960 --> 03:13:40,640
And again, let's show people from the actual book.

2828
03:13:40,640 --> 03:13:45,920
If you guys can document Cam in on here, I wanna show people this right here, right here.

2829
03:13:45,920 --> 03:13:49,580
When the weapons, thank you, when the weapons are of an amateur type as the 1880s, as they

2830
03:13:49,580 --> 03:13:54,200
were in Greece in the 5th century BC, they are widely possessed by citizens' power is

2831
03:13:54,200 --> 03:13:55,920
similarly dispersed.

2832
03:13:55,920 --> 03:14:03,320
And no minority can compel the majority to yield to its will, globalist foreign bankers.

2833
03:14:03,320 --> 03:14:09,720
With such an amateur weapons system, that's what he calls it, in other conditions are

2834
03:14:09,720 --> 03:14:12,000
not totally unfavorable.

2835
03:14:12,000 --> 03:14:16,800
See that's saying it's a problem for the elite if people are armed.

2836
03:14:16,800 --> 03:14:23,740
We are likely to find majority rule, this is a big problem, and a relatively democratic

2837
03:14:23,740 --> 03:14:24,740
political system.

2838
03:14:24,740 --> 03:14:33,020
But on the contrary, when a period can be dominated by complex and expensive weapons

2839
03:14:33,020 --> 03:14:38,160
that only a few persons can afford to possess, robot armies, drones, or can learn to use,

2840
03:14:38,160 --> 03:14:43,680
we have a situation where the minority who controls such specialist weapons can dominate

2841
03:14:43,680 --> 03:14:48,840
the majority who lack them, and the minority is a eugenicist, Luciferian psycho group.

2842
03:14:48,840 --> 03:14:51,400
You might not want them to be the only ones with weapons, just an idea.

2843
03:14:51,400 --> 03:14:56,800
In such a society, sooner or later, an authoritarian political system that reflects the inequity

2844
03:14:56,800 --> 03:14:59,720
and control of weapons will be established.

2845
03:14:59,720 --> 03:15:04,320
At the present time, there are systems to be little reason to doubt that the specialist

2846
03:15:04,320 --> 03:15:07,960
weapons of the day will continue to dominate the military picture in the foreseeable future.

2847
03:15:07,960 --> 03:15:10,740
And I'm gonna do a whole piece on this, cuz it's so important.

2848
03:15:10,740 --> 03:15:15,440
He goes on to say how terrible it is that in the United States, we have guns.

2849
03:15:15,440 --> 03:15:19,760
That's right over here, cuz they're not gonna be able to have their social engineering system,

2850
03:15:19,760 --> 03:15:22,720
because of the United States and the guns, and England.

2851
03:15:22,720 --> 03:15:24,640
Well, forget that, they got the guns in England.

2852
03:15:24,640 --> 03:15:28,520
I'm not gonna spend all day on that, Pastor Anderson, another comment there and then we'll

2853
03:15:28,520 --> 03:15:29,520
go back to the caller.

2854
03:15:29,520 --> 03:15:34,000
He talks about the distribution of power amongst a lot of people versus being ruled by a small

2855
03:15:34,000 --> 03:15:35,000
minority.

2856
03:15:35,000 --> 03:15:38,440
Well, when we look at the book of Revelation, we see the end of this is that all the power

2857
03:15:38,440 --> 03:15:41,960
is gonna be concentrated in ten kings or ten leaders.

2858
03:15:41,960 --> 03:15:42,960
And then all of those-

2859
03:15:42,960 --> 03:15:44,280
Who give power unto the beast.

2860
03:15:44,280 --> 03:15:49,660
Exactly, then those ten kings will further give all their power to one man, who's called

2861
03:15:49,660 --> 03:15:50,800
the Antichrist.

2862
03:15:50,800 --> 03:15:54,640
And this man's gonna be given all of the power, he's gonna rule over the entire world.

2863
03:15:54,640 --> 03:15:57,120
And he's gonna have cures and diseases, life extension.

2864
03:15:57,120 --> 03:16:04,840
It says his image will be projected into all places, a hologram TV, it describes that.

2865
03:16:04,840 --> 03:16:08,440
Exactly, and so he is going to rule over everyone.

2866
03:16:08,440 --> 03:16:12,480
And not only is he gonna have all the political power, but he's also going to be worshipped

2867
03:16:12,480 --> 03:16:13,860
as God.

2868
03:16:13,860 --> 03:16:17,400
And the Christians are going to declare him to be the second coming of Jesus Christ, the

2869
03:16:17,400 --> 03:16:19,080
apostate Christians.

2870
03:16:19,080 --> 03:16:22,600
That's because they believe this must be the rapture or something.

2871
03:16:22,600 --> 03:16:24,720
Yeah, this is the second coming of Christ.

2872
03:16:24,720 --> 03:16:28,840
And then the Jews are gonna say, this is our Messiah, we've been waiting for.

2873
03:16:28,840 --> 03:16:35,760
And then the Islamic people, they will declare him to be the fifth Imam or whatever, or the

2874
03:16:35,760 --> 03:16:36,980
Imam Mahdi.

2875
03:16:36,980 --> 03:16:41,080
And then the Buddhists are gonna say, well, this is the new embodiment of the Dalai Lama

2876
03:16:41,080 --> 03:16:42,080
or whatever.

2877
03:16:42,080 --> 03:16:43,080
And so-

2878
03:16:43,080 --> 03:16:46,400
That's why the UN already says, you can have your religion, but it's gonna worship this.

2879
03:16:46,400 --> 03:16:52,400
Exactly, all of the major mainline religions, including apostate Christianity, are all going

2880
03:16:52,400 --> 03:16:53,400
to be brought-

2881
03:16:53,400 --> 03:16:56,560
Well, the Pope's been saying we need a one world religion and all the same.

2882
03:16:56,560 --> 03:16:57,560
Exactly.

2883
03:16:57,560 --> 03:16:58,560
And they're all lining it up.

2884
03:16:58,560 --> 03:17:03,880
Exactly, and all of these major false religions, they're all looking for some Messiah, okay?

2885
03:17:03,880 --> 03:17:08,200
Now, yes, we are looking for the second coming of Jesus Christ, but we know it comes after

2886
03:17:08,200 --> 03:17:09,200
the tribulation.

2887
03:17:09,200 --> 03:17:11,560
We know that the imposter comes first.

2888
03:17:11,560 --> 03:17:13,380
Now think about how evil this is.

2889
03:17:13,380 --> 03:17:18,280
The Bible teaches us that before the second coming of Christ, there's an imposter coming-

2890
03:17:18,280 --> 03:17:19,660
And a great delusion.

2891
03:17:19,660 --> 03:17:24,280
A great delusion, and an imposter who comes first and claims to be Jesus Christ before

2892
03:17:24,280 --> 03:17:26,180
the real Jesus Christ comes back.

2893
03:17:26,180 --> 03:17:28,840
And what is this pre-tribulation rapture doctrine teaching?

2894
03:17:28,840 --> 03:17:33,120
To expect Jesus to come at any moment, who's really coming, the antichrist.

2895
03:17:33,120 --> 03:17:38,220
Now, exactly, now let's explain this here in overdrive, powerful information.

2896
03:17:38,220 --> 03:17:42,840
If you're looking at this, this is the only argument that people can say to shoot this

2897
03:17:42,840 --> 03:17:44,320
down.

2898
03:17:44,320 --> 03:17:47,640
The elites looked at this science fiction book, the Bible, and said, this is a great

2899
03:17:47,640 --> 03:17:52,340
idea, this hallucination, the guy on the Isle of Patmos had, John had, John the Revelator

2900
03:17:52,340 --> 03:17:53,340
and stuff.

2901
03:17:53,340 --> 03:17:56,220
This is a great idea, let's just use this.

2902
03:17:56,220 --> 03:17:59,500
And then, let's go ahead and worship Lucifer, cuz I've studied the globalist, they do, they

2903
03:17:59,500 --> 03:18:01,120
are into the occult.

2904
03:18:01,120 --> 03:18:05,160
So they've just adopted it, they've just adopted the bad guy of the book as a self-fulfilling

2905
03:18:05,160 --> 03:18:06,160
prophecy.

2906
03:18:06,160 --> 03:18:07,160
What do you say to that?

2907
03:18:07,160 --> 03:18:10,480
Well, I say the fool had said in his heart, there is no God.

2908
03:18:10,480 --> 03:18:13,620
I'm a Bible-believing Christian, I believe every word of the Bible.

2909
03:18:13,620 --> 03:18:16,720
And I think it's hard to look at all the evil in this world.

2910
03:18:16,720 --> 03:18:17,960
And it's hard to look at that.

2911
03:18:17,960 --> 03:18:19,800
Well, there is a design that's above humans.

2912
03:18:19,800 --> 03:18:20,800
There's gotta be a design.

2913
03:18:20,800 --> 03:18:25,500
I'm sorry, but I do not believe that if we travel all the way to the top, we're just

2914
03:18:25,500 --> 03:18:26,580
gonna get to the bankers.

2915
03:18:26,580 --> 03:18:27,580
I know they're at the top.

2916
03:18:27,580 --> 03:18:31,580
No, no, no, no, I've studied it, there is a spirit behind it.

2917
03:18:31,580 --> 03:18:33,920
You can see it animating and working.

2918
03:18:33,920 --> 03:18:39,020
This conspiracy is multi-generational, it's been going on for hundreds of years.

2919
03:18:39,020 --> 03:18:45,680
And it is magic, I mean, the enemy has over the horizon radar, they've got a lot of tricks.

2920
03:18:45,680 --> 03:18:49,600
It's not just one man or one group of men or one family, this has been going on for

2921
03:18:49,600 --> 03:18:53,380
hundreds of years because Satan is at the top of that pyramid.

2922
03:18:53,380 --> 03:18:58,700
And the bankers and Bill Gates and these high up globalists, eugenicists, they are working

2923
03:18:58,700 --> 03:18:59,700
for him.

2924
03:18:59,700 --> 03:19:01,700
They are getting their marching orders from him.

2925
03:19:01,700 --> 03:19:03,840
And a lot of people who don't believe in these quote unquote-

2926
03:19:03,840 --> 03:19:07,760
I've studied all these people, they're all into weird secrets and stuff.

2927
03:19:07,760 --> 03:19:11,360
And a lot of people, the reason why they don't believe in so-called conspiracy theories,

2928
03:19:11,360 --> 03:19:14,440
you can't tell me that these people have gotten together and orchestrated this.

2929
03:19:14,440 --> 03:19:18,260
No, no, it's Satan that's directing them, not all of them might even know what their

2930
03:19:18,260 --> 03:19:19,260
part is.

2931
03:19:19,260 --> 03:19:20,260
No, no, they're compartmentalized, yeah.

2932
03:19:20,260 --> 03:19:21,260
They're compartmentalized.

2933
03:19:21,260 --> 03:19:25,720
And the Bible says, for we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities,

2934
03:19:25,720 --> 03:19:31,220
against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual

2935
03:19:31,220 --> 03:19:33,060
wickedness in high places.

2936
03:19:33,060 --> 03:19:34,060
Perfect description.

2937
03:19:34,060 --> 03:19:38,920
Yeah, the Bible warns us, rulers of the darkness of this world, spiritual wickedness in high

2938
03:19:38,920 --> 03:19:39,920
places.

2939
03:19:39,920 --> 03:19:43,140
That's what needs to be preached from the- And look at all, look at how they keep busting

2940
03:19:43,140 --> 03:19:44,960
senators with underage kids.

2941
03:19:44,960 --> 03:19:45,960
Exactly.

2942
03:19:45,960 --> 03:19:50,440
I mean, you don't even get in the door unless you like to hurt children.

2943
03:19:50,440 --> 03:19:51,440
Exactly.

2944
03:19:51,440 --> 03:19:52,440
Unbelievable.

2945
03:19:52,440 --> 03:19:55,800
We'll be back, I promise we're going to go back to Sean in Australia, then a bunch of

2946
03:19:55,800 --> 03:20:02,160
other people, XM listeners, you name it, we'll see the whole hour overdrive, get ready.

2947
03:20:02,160 --> 03:20:06,800
This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.

2948
03:20:06,800 --> 03:20:11,140
Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.

2949
03:20:11,140 --> 03:20:15,800
Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows

2950
03:20:15,800 --> 03:20:16,800
you to have.

2951
03:20:16,800 --> 03:20:22,480
It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.

2952
03:20:22,480 --> 03:20:26,820
Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded and

2953
03:20:26,820 --> 03:20:30,840
now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.

2954
03:20:30,840 --> 03:20:34,360
Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.

2955
03:20:34,360 --> 03:20:38,020
Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages.

2956
03:20:38,020 --> 03:20:42,600
Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.

2957
03:20:42,600 --> 03:20:46,560
Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,

2958
03:20:46,560 --> 03:20:47,920

Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold

2983
03:22:36,280 --> 03:22:37,280
IRAs?

2984
03:22:37,280 --> 03:22:41,320
They've been available since 1986 yet the financial industry won't recognize the value

03:22:41,320 --> 03:22:43,000
of gold for your retirement.

2986
03:22:43,000 --> 03:22:46,480

3005
03:24:08,280 --> 03:24:13,480
We have Steven L. Anderson, a pastor, and he's one of the very informative people in

3006
03:24:13,480 --> 03:24:16,800
this amazing film, After the Tribulation, Let No Man Seem You.

3007
03:24:16,800 --> 03:24:24,480
New film out available at InfowarsShop.com or link through at Infowars.com and also the

3008
03:24:24,480 --> 03:24:28,960
book by Chuck Baldwin and his constitutional lawyer son Timothy Baldwin, Romans 13, The

3009
03:24:28,960 --> 03:24:30,940
True Meaning of Submission.

3010
03:24:30,940 --> 03:24:34,280
Very important to get all your preachers out there, they'll probably curl up like snakes

3011
03:24:34,280 --> 03:24:38,140
and hiss at you and pull out a pitchfork, but no, most of them don't know.

3012
03:24:38,140 --> 03:24:40,000
It's our job to challenge them.

3013
03:24:40,000 --> 03:24:44,440
I'm not on some high horse either here, folks, I mean I'm Mr. Goody Two-Shoes, I know right

3014
03:24:44,440 --> 03:24:49,480
from wrong, I know deception from the truth, because I have discernment, I mean anybody

3015
03:24:49,480 --> 03:24:53,440
who has discernment would just be freaking out over all this, especially when you integrate

3016
03:24:53,440 --> 03:24:58,600
it with history and everything else and what the globalists are doing.

3017
03:24:58,600 --> 03:25:01,960
The more I learn about the New World Order and then the more I go to the Bible, it's

3018
03:25:01,960 --> 03:25:08,500
like oh my gosh, now I could only now, 38 years old, almost 39, 39 a couple days, actually

3019
03:25:08,500 --> 03:25:13,320
understand the Bible and it's just so deep now, unlike anything I've ever read, once

3020
03:25:13,320 --> 03:25:15,480
you understand that you know it is inspired.

3021
03:25:15,480 --> 03:25:19,560
And it is a warning, I mean God wouldn't put us through this to test us if he didn't give

3022
03:25:19,560 --> 03:25:20,560
us a handbook.

3023
03:25:20,560 --> 03:25:23,920
Okay, and I'm not trying to preach here, it's just that you have to understand, ladies and

3024
03:25:23,920 --> 03:25:28,840
gentlemen, we are facing an elite that believe they're being directed by spirits.

3025
03:25:28,840 --> 03:25:33,640
Skull and bones, Bohemian Grove, the UN has this Luciferian Chapel in New York in it,

3026
03:25:33,640 --> 03:25:34,640
it's real.

3027
03:25:34,640 --> 03:25:40,020
Okay, I'm gonna go to Ed, Eric, Nick, Nick, and others, but Sean in Australia, you got

3028
03:25:40,020 --> 03:25:45,400
us off on this thing about Carol Quigley's book, where they admit free peoples have weapons,

3029
03:25:45,400 --> 03:25:49,120
but we want a technocratic elite with super weapons because we want control.

3030
03:25:49,120 --> 03:25:55,260
Yes, amazing, here's one of their top statisticians, tacticians admitting this, but it's like admitting

3031
03:25:55,260 --> 03:25:59,940
the sun came up this morning, but yes, they want our guns to enslave us, not to keep the

3032
03:25:59,940 --> 03:26:00,940
children safe.

3033
03:26:00,940 --> 03:26:01,940
Go ahead.

3034
03:26:01,940 --> 03:26:10,360
Well, you see, this book, Tragedy and Hope, is an informed historical account, but what

3035
03:26:10,360 --> 03:26:17,120
it lacks is the actual understanding of the proper framework for understanding human history,

3036
03:26:17,120 --> 03:26:21,520
and that is looking at human history based on its developmental qualitative state.

3037
03:26:21,520 --> 03:26:26,080
Now, let me give the readers an example just based on this.

3038
03:26:26,080 --> 03:26:30,200
The point is they're saying we have the will to power, we're in charge, that gives us the

3039
03:26:30,200 --> 03:26:35,760
right to be authoritarian, as if some moral authoritarianism, it never works like that,

3040
03:26:35,760 --> 03:26:37,340
it always leads to total rot.

3041
03:26:37,340 --> 03:26:41,360
But of course, some academic feeling good about himself because he's invited into the

3042
03:26:41,360 --> 03:26:44,160
upper halls of power is delusional.

3043
03:26:44,160 --> 03:26:46,960
This person is not spiritually smart.

3044
03:26:46,960 --> 03:26:49,960
I gotta jump to other callers, go ahead and finish it up quick cuz we gotta go.

3045
03:26:49,960 --> 03:26:56,480
Let me give the callers a quick example, now for example, I'm talking about organizational

3046
03:26:56,480 --> 03:26:57,480
development in history.

3047
03:26:57,480 --> 03:27:03,360
If we look at his passage, he says, the medieval period in which the best weapon was usually

3048
03:27:03,360 --> 03:27:09,300
a mounted knight on horseback, clearly a specialist weapon, was a period of minority rule and

3049
03:27:09,300 --> 03:27:10,300
authoritarian government.

3050
03:27:10,300 --> 03:27:12,400
Once again, it should be totalitarian.

3051
03:27:12,400 --> 03:27:17,920
Even when the medieval knight was made obsolete, along with his stone castle, by the invention

3052
03:27:17,920 --> 03:27:22,840
of gunpowder and the appearance of firearms, these new weapons were so expensive and so

3053
03:27:22,840 --> 03:27:27,720
difficult to use until 1800, that the minority rule and authoritarian government continued,

3054
03:27:27,720 --> 03:27:31,880
even though that the government sought to enforce its rule, by shifting from mounted

3055
03:27:31,880 --> 03:27:34,280
knights to professional pikemen and musketeers.

3056
03:27:34,280 --> 03:27:37,960
Now this shift is a qualitative upshift in development.

3057
03:27:37,960 --> 03:27:42,520
You see, the new phase of technology, the gunpowder, is a higher-

3058
03:27:42,520 --> 03:27:47,080
No, I agree, this is all gonna leak out everywhere, the bioweapons everywhere, and they're gonna

3059
03:27:47,080 --> 03:27:49,080
kill everybody.

3060
03:27:49,080 --> 03:27:52,440
And is that where you're going, the elite are creating their own destruction by a global

3061
03:27:52,440 --> 03:27:53,440
arms race?

3062
03:27:53,440 --> 03:28:00,120
Well, where I'm going is that, if you look at human history, we see these changes.

3063
03:28:00,120 --> 03:28:07,040
Now, the scientists who actually have now taken the overall commanding, the overall

3064
03:28:07,040 --> 03:28:12,600
directing ideological position in this global-

3065
03:28:12,600 --> 03:28:14,600
Gotta finish up in 30 seconds.

3066
03:28:14,600 --> 03:28:18,240
They believe in something called, they believe in the second law of thermodynamics.

3067
03:28:18,240 --> 03:28:23,520
Now, I'll issue a challenge right now to every scientist worldwide who believes in the big

3068
03:28:23,520 --> 03:28:27,640
bang in the context of the second law of thermodynamics, if you want to hold me on for another-

3069
03:28:27,640 --> 03:28:31,680
Now I gotta go, listen, this is what I do with callers, I'll let one person on for a

3070
03:28:31,680 --> 03:28:34,120
long time and then everybody else can get on.

3071
03:28:34,120 --> 03:28:36,920
Sean, if I wouldn't have gotten to other callers, I never would have gotten to you, I gotta

3072
03:28:36,920 --> 03:28:37,920
let you go.

3073
03:28:37,920 --> 03:28:42,560
And we got a long segment coming up here, and I promise we're gonna get to Ed, Eric,

3074
03:28:42,560 --> 03:28:46,880
Nick, Nick, and then that's gonna be it for calls, our XM listeners and shortwave listeners

3075
03:28:46,880 --> 03:28:47,880
and AM and FM listeners.

3076
03:28:47,880 --> 03:28:51,200
We're gonna get to you, and then we're gonna give him some time to finish up some other

3077
03:28:51,200 --> 03:28:53,600
topics and some other news that I haven't gotten to.

3078
03:28:53,600 --> 03:28:56,760
But do you wanna comment on where he was going with all that?

3079
03:28:56,760 --> 03:29:03,480
Well, I mean, it's really interesting information and the Bible definitely is very clear that

3080
03:29:03,480 --> 03:29:05,480
every single person should have a weapon.

3081
03:29:05,480 --> 03:29:09,580
All the way back to the book of Deuteronomy, he talks about every single citizen having

3082
03:29:09,580 --> 03:29:12,760
a weapon and having a paddle on the back of their weapon and so forth.

3083
03:29:12,760 --> 03:29:13,960
Because it restrains evil.

3084
03:29:13,960 --> 03:29:18,120
And then also even Jesus Christ himself in the Garden of Gethsemane said, hey, if you

3085
03:29:18,120 --> 03:29:20,340
don't have a sword, you need to sell your coat.

3086
03:29:20,340 --> 03:29:23,800
And they try to spin that now and say it was misinterpreted.

3087
03:29:23,800 --> 03:29:25,840
He was talking about a literal sword.

3088
03:29:25,840 --> 03:29:29,400
They pulled out two literal swords and said, Lord, we have two swords, and he said it's

3089
03:29:29,400 --> 03:29:30,400
enough.

3090
03:29:30,400 --> 03:29:33,200
And so the disciples had swords.

3091
03:29:33,200 --> 03:29:35,600
Plus somebody just had their ear chopped off with a sword.

3092
03:29:35,600 --> 03:29:36,600
We're talking about swords.

3093
03:29:36,600 --> 03:29:39,520
Yeah, Peter pulled out a sword and chopped the ear off.

3094
03:29:39,520 --> 03:29:41,320
Don't tell me that was a metaphor for the Bible.

3095
03:29:41,320 --> 03:29:44,800
He didn't pull out his Bible and chop that guy's ears off with a with a paper cut with

3096
03:29:44,800 --> 03:29:45,800
a Bible.

3097
03:29:45,800 --> 03:29:47,800
It was a literal sword.

3098
03:29:47,800 --> 03:29:49,400
We'll be right back.

3099
03:29:49,400 --> 03:29:51,560
Stay with us.

3100

3128
03:32:00,480 --> 03:32:06,240
Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the bestselling book Cancer Step Outside the Box.

3129
03:32:06,240 --> 03:32:09,200
I want you to know some very important information.

3130
03:32:09,200 --> 03:32:14,000
In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White

3131
03:32:14,000 --> 03:32:18,320
House at a time when only the president could obtain this world class healer.

3132
03:32:18,320 --> 03:32:23,880
Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.

3133
03:32:23,880 --> 03:32:28,960
Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally

3134
03:32:28,960 --> 03:32:34,100
occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single

3135
03:32:34,100 --> 03:32:35,240
normal cell.

3136
03:32:35,240 --> 03:32:39,000
If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune

3137
03:32:39,000 --> 03:32:43,000
cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.

3138

That's 1-866-836-8735, 1-866-VENUSFLY or visit Carnivora dot com.

3140
03:32:58,280 --> 03:33:01,920
That's your immune system, it's the only one you've got.

3141
03:33:01,920 --> 03:33:10,920
I'd like to share a revelation that I've had during my time here.

3142
03:33:10,920 --> 03:33:19,000
It came to me when I tried to classify your species and I realized that you're not actually

3143
03:33:19,000 --> 03:33:21,360
mammals.

3144
03:33:21,360 --> 03:33:28,280
Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with the surrounding

3145
03:33:28,280 --> 03:33:31,600
environment, but you humans do not.

3146
03:33:31,600 --> 03:33:40,320
You move to an area and you multiply and multiply until every natural resource is consumed.

3147
03:33:40,320 --> 03:33:51,000
The only way you can survive is to spread to another area.

3148
03:33:51,000 --> 03:33:55,720
There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern.

3149
03:33:55,720 --> 03:33:58,840
Do you know what it is?

3150
03:33:58,840 --> 03:34:02,080
A virus.

3151
03:34:02,080 --> 03:34:17,520
Human beings are a disease, a cancer of this planet, you are a plague and we are the cure.

3152
03:34:17,520 --> 03:34:21,680
Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.

3153
03:34:21,680 --> 03:34:23,680
It's Alex Jones.

3154
03:34:23,680 --> 03:34:31,240
Yep, that's what the globalists think of us, but then they try to block development, so

3155
03:34:31,240 --> 03:34:34,920
it's a self-fulfilling prophecy that we are these dogs, they say we are, but I study the

3156
03:34:34,920 --> 03:34:35,920
globalists.

3157
03:34:35,920 --> 03:34:38,240
They're a bunch of inbred people that are psychopaths.

3158
03:34:38,240 --> 03:34:41,620
We're going to go to your calls right now.

3159
03:34:41,620 --> 03:34:43,120
We have a new t-shirt out.

3160
03:34:43,120 --> 03:34:45,360
We haven't sold this for over a year and a half.

3161
03:34:45,360 --> 03:34:50,720
We had a Obama joker symbol that went viral all over the world, and I said it was a limited

3162
03:34:50,720 --> 03:34:54,920
edition t-shirt of it, and we haven't sold it in over a year and a half.

3163
03:34:54,920 --> 03:34:58,080
So we've redesigned a new one because that was limited edition.

3164
03:34:58,080 --> 03:35:02,540
Janae Meadows, our star graphics person, they're all stars, but she's amazing.

3165
03:35:02,540 --> 03:35:08,080
She came up with this of a bunch that we did that is my favorite and it says, Tyrant Obama

3166
03:35:08,080 --> 03:35:10,240
and him as the Joker.

3167
03:35:10,240 --> 03:35:13,840
And Obama-noids will ask you what it means, others will, you can explain what a tyrant

3168
03:35:13,840 --> 03:35:14,840
is.

3169
03:35:14,840 --> 03:35:19,560
And in our most popular t-shirt and put it on the back, the come and take it AK-47 with

3170
03:35:19,560 --> 03:35:23,480
the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed, words inside of it.

3171
03:35:23,480 --> 03:35:26,200
This I believe is the best t-shirt we've ever come out with.

3172
03:35:26,200 --> 03:35:30,720
It is available at Infowars shop.com or Infowarsstore.com.

3173
03:35:30,720 --> 03:35:37,560
Both URLs take you to the same place or by calling 888-25-33139, and your purchase of

3174
03:35:37,560 --> 03:35:41,400
books and videos and materials funds our entire operation.

3175
03:35:41,400 --> 03:35:46,480
And look, I got 50 people here, 51, I wanna hire five or six more to quite frankly do

3176
03:35:46,480 --> 03:35:48,440
radio news cuz stations all want it.

3177
03:35:48,440 --> 03:35:52,360
And that first five, six minute segment, we're getting ready to get the show cut down to

3178
03:35:52,360 --> 03:35:55,560
its official version every day with the nightly news.

3179
03:35:55,560 --> 03:35:57,200
It's all happening.

3180
03:35:57,200 --> 03:36:02,160
It's all happening and we just put out 150,000 free bumper stickers in 50 packs with the

3181
03:36:02,160 --> 03:36:05,400
free shipping to anybody that wanted them at Infowarsstore.com.

3182
03:36:05,400 --> 03:36:09,440
I think all those slots are filled now, 3,000 of them.

3183
03:36:09,440 --> 03:36:14,160
I mean, I know it's coming down, it's in steps downwards.

3184
03:36:14,160 --> 03:36:18,280
We're gone into another big step and now another, and it's gonna accelerate, boom, boom, boom,

3185
03:36:18,280 --> 03:36:19,280
boom, boom.

3186
03:36:19,280 --> 03:36:23,880
So I'm just like, fire everything, hit them, go, boom.

3187
03:36:23,880 --> 03:36:28,720
My gut is what I follow, my spirit, and it tells me what to do off the intellectual things.

3188
03:36:28,720 --> 03:36:32,640
But what my gut tells me is also picked up by everything in front of me.

3189
03:36:32,640 --> 03:36:36,160
It's amazing, it knows what's around the corner and then boom, it's there.

3190
03:36:36,160 --> 03:36:41,440
And I trust but verify my gut, this will sell out as well as 30,000 of them available, 70,000

3191
03:36:41,440 --> 03:36:42,440
at the streets.

3192
03:36:42,440 --> 03:36:47,640
In key areas in Texas is the Infowar, but the tyrants, why the tyrants want the guns,

We've got all the films, we're putting stuff up there in HD now, most of it.

3200
03:37:16,120 --> 03:37:20,440
We're putting a lot of old archive stuff, ten years of prisonplanet.tv in April, 17

3201
03:37:20,440 --> 03:37:23,280
years on air, a lot of old stuff we're now putting there.

3202
03:37:23,280 --> 03:37:25,680
But the goal is to reach people.

3203
03:37:25,680 --> 03:37:29,600
So we're gonna start in the next few weeks on a limited basis, I wanna make sure it works

3204
03:37:29,600 --> 03:37:31,520
well and doesn't bankrupt me.

3205
03:37:31,520 --> 03:37:35,720
We're gonna have the three hour radio show in a medium quality, the high quality would

3206
03:37:35,720 --> 03:37:36,720
be for subscribers.

3207
03:37:36,720 --> 03:37:43,360
But the goal is to get the word out to people, prisonplanet.tv, the video feed of the three

3208
03:37:43,360 --> 03:37:46,300
hour today, it's a four hour radio show.

3209
03:37:46,300 --> 03:37:51,680
That will be fed out to everyone that signs up at infowars.com forward slash newsletter.

3210
03:37:51,680 --> 03:37:58,180
In a week or two, you'll get a link to the test beta streamed to make sure we can afford

3211
03:37:58,180 --> 03:38:00,160
it and everything.

3212
03:38:00,160 --> 03:38:06,440
And so we're definitely gonna test that out over a few months.

3213
03:38:06,440 --> 03:38:11,920
So again, I want to encourage everybody to sign up at infowars.com forward slash newsletter.

3214
03:38:11,920 --> 03:38:18,620
Now I promise to go to your calls and Pastor Steven Anderson is here also in studio with

3215
03:38:18,620 --> 03:38:20,660
us today.

3216
03:38:20,660 --> 03:38:25,360
But other points you'd like to add, you wanted to get into Plato's Republic, which is a key

3217
03:38:25,360 --> 03:38:26,360
globalist model.

3218
03:38:26,360 --> 03:38:30,440
You know, Tarpley will tell you that that's the model of the oligarchy in the New World,

3219
03:38:30,440 --> 03:38:31,440
or Plato's Republic.

3220
03:38:31,440 --> 03:38:34,440
We're gonna talk about that after we race through calls here.

3221
03:38:34,440 --> 03:38:41,880
But it's important to read the globalist intelligentsia's own manuals to not just believe us, but that

3222
03:38:41,880 --> 03:38:45,600
caller called in and said, hey, Tragedy and Hope says disarm the people to make them slaves,

3223
03:38:45,600 --> 03:38:46,600
top globalist book.

3224
03:38:46,600 --> 03:38:50,880
I go pull it off the shelf, sure enough, what he reads there, trust but verify.

3225
03:38:50,880 --> 03:38:54,480
And again, it's hundreds and hundreds of books I've read where they admit their plan for

3226
03:38:54,480 --> 03:38:56,440
global government and global enslavement.

3227
03:38:56,440 --> 03:39:01,560
Ed in New York, thanks for holding, you're listening on shortwave, go ahead.

3228
03:39:01,560 --> 03:39:08,200
Yes, I heard you describe that you have different products you have for sale just now for a

3229
03:39:08,200 --> 03:39:09,200
while.

3230
03:39:09,200 --> 03:39:16,520
And over the years, I thought that I had something to contribute to your show.

3231
03:39:16,520 --> 03:39:22,760
I thought it was the technology that Pat Flanagan has described in the book by Nick Bejic, Towards

3232
03:39:22,760 --> 03:39:29,240
a New Alchemy, where the neurophone he describes, I believe is miniaturized.

3233
03:39:29,240 --> 03:39:34,240
Yeah, they're now selling neurophones, they've got all sorts of new products.

3234
03:39:34,240 --> 03:39:39,600
The new Google Glasses have a neurophone and broadcast into your skull, into the middle

3235
03:39:39,600 --> 03:39:40,600
ear.

3236
03:39:40,600 --> 03:39:42,560
So that's the big technology they're going for.

3237
03:39:42,560 --> 03:39:46,760
Yeah, do you have any comments on that?

3238
03:39:46,760 --> 03:39:50,080
Neurophone only receives, it doesn't transmit.

3239
03:39:50,080 --> 03:39:56,640
Well, I'm talking about, guys, just type it in right now, Google Glasses broadcast sound

3240
03:39:56,640 --> 03:39:58,480
directly into the middle ear.

3241
03:39:58,480 --> 03:40:02,720
The point is that 15 years ago they had Coke machines in Japan that projected you, nobody

3242
03:40:02,720 --> 03:40:05,280
else can hear it, and it goes through to the skull.

3243
03:40:05,280 --> 03:40:10,040
All right, I appreciate your call, I'm not sure we're talking about neurophone, write

3244
03:40:10,040 --> 03:40:11,040
me a letter.

3245
03:40:11,040 --> 03:40:16,200
Okay, about that, let's go to Eric in Wyoming, then we're gonna go to Nick listening on XM.

3246
03:40:16,200 --> 03:40:17,920
Eric in Wyoming, you're on the air.

3247
03:40:17,920 --> 03:40:23,320
Good afternoon, Mr. Jones, my name is Eric Miller, I'm not hiding my identity.

3248
03:40:23,320 --> 03:40:26,040
We had an incident here at 1006 Plum Street.

3249
03:40:26,040 --> 03:40:29,640
Hold on, hold on, sir, sir, let me put you on hold.

3250
03:40:29,640 --> 03:40:32,920
We don't like people, nobody does this to talk radio.

3251
03:40:32,920 --> 03:40:35,520
Sometimes we get a lot of great calls, sometimes we get calls that are interesting, but they're

3252
03:40:35,520 --> 03:40:40,440
all over the map, especially when I go into a fourth hour and people have been holding.

3253
03:40:40,440 --> 03:40:45,520
Listen, you call in, you could be saying somebody else's name, I don't think you're a liar,

3254
03:40:45,520 --> 03:40:49,400
you sound like a reasonable guy, but other people can spoof and call in and say, I'm

3255
03:40:49,400 --> 03:40:52,520
this person at this address, this is happening.

3256
03:40:52,520 --> 03:40:56,040
And then we can get in trouble for letting that information go out.

3257
03:40:56,040 --> 03:40:59,700
You understand that's a dirty trick people do, so that's why we don't like people giving

3258
03:40:59,700 --> 03:41:01,160
out their last name.

3259
03:41:01,160 --> 03:41:04,520
Now they're a public figure and they call in and we think we recognize their voice,

3260
03:41:04,520 --> 03:41:06,760
we put them on hold, call them back, verify who they are.

3261
03:41:06,760 --> 03:41:10,880
Okay, now I'm not saying you're doing this, but just tell us about the incident, what

3262
03:41:10,880 --> 03:41:11,880
happened to you?

3263
03:41:11,880 --> 03:41:17,640
We got smart meters, we have Agenda 21 in the capital city of Cheyenne, Wyoming, we

3264
03:41:17,640 --> 03:41:22,720
got smart meters, we have Agenda 21, we have international building codes.

3265
03:41:22,720 --> 03:41:29,720
And we were forced, all right, by three Cheyenne Lightroom power workers and a deputy while

3266
03:41:29,720 --> 03:41:33,280
I was away, they came and threatened my wife.

3267
03:41:33,280 --> 03:41:37,720
Yeah, they put the eavesdropping that dowels into all your electronics on record and is

3268
03:41:37,720 --> 03:41:39,680
gonna quote, control your temperature.

3269
03:41:39,680 --> 03:41:42,760
They put the little, that's a little robot, it's a drone.

3270
03:41:42,760 --> 03:41:46,880
It's a, they admit they're going to robots, it just hit me.

3271
03:41:46,880 --> 03:41:51,560
The smart meter is a little robot that's plugged into the side of your house spying on you,

3272
03:41:51,560 --> 03:41:53,120
it's a robot spy.

3273
03:41:53,120 --> 03:41:54,400
Okay, what happened to you?

3274
03:41:54,400 --> 03:41:58,700
We're seeing the videos of the police coming with the smart meters and some are saying,

3275
03:41:58,700 --> 03:42:02,280
we don't care if you even turn your power off, you're going to have it slave, go ahead.

3276
03:42:02,280 --> 03:42:07,560
Yeah, so anyway, they forced away and I referred to them as the four cowards while I was away

3277
03:42:07,560 --> 03:42:12,440
from home, they came and intimidated my wife or else, all right?

3278
03:42:12,440 --> 03:42:18,600
Now, no man wants to come home and see his wife staring out the kitchen window in tears

3279
03:42:18,600 --> 03:42:21,820
and wondering what happened, just happened.

3280
03:42:21,820 --> 03:42:26,560
Now we got our smart meter, they also put a lock on it, which they took off later on

3281
03:42:26,560 --> 03:42:29,640
and two tags, a tag for the lock.

3282
03:42:29,640 --> 03:42:33,000
In other words, they were trying to demonize us for standing up.

3283
03:42:33,000 --> 03:42:37,400
No, I know, it's so weird, you don't want a smart meter admitted to rip you off?

3284
03:42:37,400 --> 03:42:41,360
It's on record, they use them to rip people off, that's San Francisco Chronicle, you name

3285
03:42:41,360 --> 03:42:42,360
it.

3286
03:42:42,360 --> 03:42:47,720
It dials into all new appliances, have digital wireless and your TV, this dials into and

3287
03:42:47,720 --> 03:42:50,280
it's all these health issues, you're weird.

3288
03:42:50,280 --> 03:42:54,520
You care what we're putting on your house, you're weird, it's weird to care about anything.

3289
03:42:54,520 --> 03:42:59,800
You don't like the army checkpoints on your highways and drills in every major city and

3290
03:42:59,800 --> 03:43:05,720
TSA, two miles from here, TSA runs checkpoints on the road now, but that's no big deal, that's

3291
03:43:05,720 --> 03:43:07,840
freedom, Pastor Anderson.

3292
03:43:07,840 --> 03:43:09,880
So how did this end, sir?

3293
03:43:09,880 --> 03:43:15,640
Well this ended with them forcing their way into my home and putting in the smart meter.

3294
03:43:15,640 --> 03:43:16,640
Into the home?

3295
03:43:16,640 --> 03:43:21,720
Yeah, well, they had to go to my home to get to my backyard cuz we have a fence that has

3296
03:43:21,720 --> 03:43:25,360
high privacy fence that's over six feet and it says-

3297
03:43:25,360 --> 03:43:30,960
Excuse me, this is a major felony, you've got a file suit on, official oppression, civil

3298
03:43:30,960 --> 03:43:34,840
rights violations, just sue them, okay?

3299
03:43:34,840 --> 03:43:40,160
And sir, you know what, I can tell you're a real guy, you wanna give out your name and

3300
03:43:40,160 --> 03:43:45,240
info for any constitutional lawyers that wanna stand up for you and your family in the state

3301
03:43:45,240 --> 03:43:46,240
of Washington?

3302
03:43:46,240 --> 03:43:47,240
Yes.

3303
03:43:47,240 --> 03:43:48,240
Okay, give out-

3304
03:43:48,240 --> 03:43:49,240
And Wyoming we're in.

3305
03:43:49,240 --> 03:43:50,240
Okay, what?

3306
03:43:50,240 --> 03:43:51,240
We're in the state of Wyoming.

3307
03:43:51,240 --> 03:43:52,240
Oh, okay, Wyoming, sorry, go ahead.

3308
03:43:52,240 --> 03:43:54,920
Most conservative state and Cheyenne is the capital.

3309
03:43:54,920 --> 03:43:57,360
I know, but this is happening to everybody right now.

3310
03:43:57,360 --> 03:43:59,040
So they forced their way into the house?

3311
03:43:59,040 --> 03:44:03,120
Well, they said or else, I got the phone call while I was up at the farm-

3312
03:44:03,120 --> 03:44:04,120
Or else, or else.

3313
03:44:04,120 --> 03:44:05,120
Or else.

3314
03:44:05,120 --> 03:44:06,120
That's free country.

3315
03:44:06,120 --> 03:44:07,120
Or else, and-

3316
03:44:07,120 --> 03:44:10,280
You know what the answer is, go dark.

3317
03:44:10,280 --> 03:44:14,280
You tell them you come remove it, you send them a cease and desist cuz courts like that,

3318
03:44:14,280 --> 03:44:16,840
then you sue them when they don't remove it, go dark.

3319
03:44:16,840 --> 03:44:19,720
Make a stand in the local news, make a big issue out of it.

3320
03:44:19,720 --> 03:44:23,200
Believe me, you're the new Rosa Parks, this is the new civil rights issue, they want us

3321
03:44:23,200 --> 03:44:26,200
fighting over race and all this stuff, this is what's happening.

3322
03:44:26,200 --> 03:44:29,960
Okay, how do people, do you have an email address or something so lawyers can help you

3323
03:44:29,960 --> 03:44:30,960
in Wyoming?

3324
03:44:30,960 --> 03:44:31,960
Yes, I do.

3325
03:44:31,960 --> 03:44:32,960
Give it to us.

3326
03:44:32,960 --> 03:44:45,160
All right, it's ebmcat9msn.com, Echo Victor Motel Charlie Alpha Tango 29 at msn.com.

3327
03:44:45,160 --> 03:44:54,480
Yeah, what happened is Halliburton, not Halliburton, though they're involved, Ken Lay, I'm so tired,

3328
03:44:54,480 --> 03:44:55,480
Enron.

3329
03:44:55,480 --> 03:44:59,920
Enron developed this in the mid 90s as a scam, they're convicted of scamming, and they can

3330
03:44:59,920 --> 03:45:05,480
control the prices, manipulate, gouge, and spy, this is all their smart growth plan.

3331
03:45:05,480 --> 03:45:08,940
And so you just get that together, you fight it in your local community, everybody has

3332
03:45:08,940 --> 03:45:13,080
to fight this because it's diabolical, God bless you, and I appreciate your call.

3333
03:45:13,080 --> 03:45:18,000
They're also using the smart meters that are up on polls that dial into your smart meter.

3334
03:45:18,000 --> 03:45:21,840
Those are hacking in, just like Google's been caught doing with their cars.

3335
03:45:21,840 --> 03:45:24,160
Pastor Anderson comments on what he was saying.

3336
03:45:24,160 --> 03:45:28,280
Well, unfortunately, I think I might have a smart meter at my house already.

3337
03:45:28,280 --> 03:45:31,880
No, no, that's what they do, they just show up, they come across your yard, they put it

3338
03:45:31,880 --> 03:45:32,880
on.

3339
03:45:32,880 --> 03:45:34,680
Yeah, they never even asked me about it.

3340
03:45:34,680 --> 03:45:37,680
It's just something that I think has just been installed a long time ago.

3341
03:45:37,680 --> 03:45:38,680
And there it is.

3342
03:45:38,680 --> 03:45:41,960
I don't really, you know, I think what they do is they charge you more when they feel

3343
03:45:41,960 --> 03:45:42,960
like it.

3344
03:45:42,960 --> 03:45:46,080
They track everything you're doing, and they grab all your wireless data, and they hack

3345
03:45:46,080 --> 03:45:47,080
your computers.

3346
03:45:47,080 --> 03:45:49,080
Well, I already know that I've been under surveillance.

3347
03:45:49,080 --> 03:45:50,080
No, I know.

3348
03:45:50,080 --> 03:45:52,880
But the point is, is that it's this total grid, right?

3349
03:45:52,880 --> 03:45:54,880
Oh, yeah, definitely.

3350
03:45:54,880 --> 03:45:56,560
And I mean, it has to be that way.

3351
03:45:56,560 --> 03:46:00,080
You know, it's like the Bible says, all these things must come to pass, but the end is not

3352
03:46:00,080 --> 03:46:01,080
yet.

3353
03:46:01,080 --> 03:46:02,500
You know, it has to be in place.

3354
03:46:02,500 --> 03:46:06,720
The control grid has to be in place in order to get all the power.

3355
03:46:06,720 --> 03:46:08,600
But we have to resist it.

3356
03:46:08,600 --> 03:46:09,600
Absolutely.

3357
03:46:09,600 --> 03:46:10,600
Of course we can.

3358
03:46:10,600 --> 03:46:12,840
I mean, folks, if you won't resist now, you're not gonna resist when they got a gun to your

3359
03:46:12,840 --> 03:46:13,840
head.

3360
03:46:13,840 --> 03:46:17,800
Look, the Bible verse I quoted earlier says, we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but

3361
03:46:17,800 --> 03:46:22,560
against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world.

3362
03:46:22,560 --> 03:46:26,360
So it's saying we do wrestle against the rulers of the darkness of this world.

3363
03:46:26,360 --> 03:46:29,760
We do wrestle against spiritual wickedness in high places.

3364
03:46:29,760 --> 03:46:33,880
But wait, I mean, but they twist Romans 13 to say that we should have submitted to Hitler.

3365
03:46:33,880 --> 03:46:36,360
You know, they now teach Hitler was of the Lord.

3366
03:46:36,360 --> 03:46:40,320
Well, you know, you can twist, you can take little tiny bits and pieces of the Bible and

3367
03:46:40,320 --> 03:46:42,040
twist them to say whatever you want.

3368
03:46:42,040 --> 03:46:45,620
But earlier in the chapter, it's all about resisting tyranny and people are being arrested

3369
03:46:45,620 --> 03:46:46,960
for not following orders.

3370
03:46:46,960 --> 03:46:52,180
Not only that, Romans 13 is really clear about what the purpose of government is.

3371
03:46:52,180 --> 03:46:57,180
The only purpose of government, which is the punishment of evildoers, evildoer meaning

3372
03:46:57,180 --> 03:47:00,120
someone, evil in the Bible means harming someone else.

3373
03:47:00,120 --> 03:47:01,120
So it's to punish people-

3374
03:47:01,120 --> 03:47:02,120
It's a libertarian-

3375
03:47:02,120 --> 03:47:04,960
Exactly, exactly right.

3376
03:47:04,960 --> 03:47:06,800
And so God never gave the government-

3377
03:47:06,800 --> 03:47:08,120
No initiation of force.

3378
03:47:08,120 --> 03:47:14,120
Exactly, and so God never gave the government the authority to regulate our lives.

3379
03:47:14,120 --> 03:47:18,480
But maybe Romans 13 and one of these mainline preachers say maybe the US senator caught

3380
03:47:18,480 --> 03:47:20,720
with all these little kids, maybe he's the government.

3381
03:47:20,720 --> 03:47:23,000
I mean, I don't agree with that, but I'm a devil.

3382
03:47:23,000 --> 03:47:26,040
See, I don't think that senator should be having sex with little kids.

3383
03:47:26,040 --> 03:47:28,400
I am now violating Romans 13.

3384
03:47:28,400 --> 03:47:33,920
Well, they try to claim that basically every single governor or government official is

3385
03:47:33,920 --> 03:47:38,920
ordained by God when what he's saying is that he ordained human government in general.

3386
03:47:38,920 --> 03:47:42,600
The Bible is teaching that God ordained, you know, parents to have authority over their

3387
03:47:42,600 --> 03:47:47,520
children and he ordained human government to be there to punish the evildoer.

3388
03:47:47,520 --> 03:47:49,480
You know, thieves, rapists, murderers.

3389
03:47:49,480 --> 03:47:53,360
But when it's an evil government, we have a duty to overthrow it.

3390
03:47:53,360 --> 03:47:54,360
Absolutely.

3391
03:47:54,360 --> 03:47:56,600
But wait a minute, that's of the devil.

3392
03:47:56,600 --> 03:48:00,560
I mean, Dominican prostitute says Senator Bob Menendez likes the youngest and newest

3393
03:48:00,560 --> 03:48:01,560
girls.

3394
03:48:01,560 --> 03:48:02,560
I mean, he's a senator.

3395
03:48:02,560 --> 03:48:04,040
I mean, maybe he's God.

3396
03:48:04,040 --> 03:48:05,960
I mean, they already say Congress is above the law.

3397
03:48:05,960 --> 03:48:10,400
According to a lot of these pastors, you know that guy, we need to submit to him and love

3398
03:48:10,400 --> 03:48:12,580
him and pray for him and think he's wonderful.

3399
03:48:12,580 --> 03:48:13,580
And bring him children.

3400
03:48:13,580 --> 03:48:18,080
If you read the book of Judges, all throughout the book of Judges, there are all kinds of

3401
03:48:18,080 --> 03:48:21,480
oppressive governments coming in, taking away the freedom.

3402
03:48:21,480 --> 03:48:24,920
And then men like Gideon and men like Samson are standing up to him.

3403
03:48:24,920 --> 03:48:25,920
Well, they were of the devil.

3404
03:48:25,920 --> 03:48:26,920
No, no, no, no.

3405
03:48:26,920 --> 03:48:27,920
They were devils.

3406
03:48:27,920 --> 03:48:28,920
Samson was of the devil.

3407
03:48:28,920 --> 03:48:30,740
Delilah was good.

3408
03:48:30,740 --> 03:48:32,360
She did what the government said.

3409
03:48:32,360 --> 03:48:33,360
Samson was bad.

3410
03:48:33,360 --> 03:48:34,360
Right.

3411
03:48:34,360 --> 03:48:35,360
And you know what?

3412
03:48:35,360 --> 03:48:36,360
They were coming to Samson saying, look.

3413
03:48:36,360 --> 03:48:38,880
The Pharisees were good and you know who else was bad.

3414
03:48:38,880 --> 03:48:39,880
And you know what?

3415
03:48:39,880 --> 03:48:40,880
They came to Samson.

3416
03:48:40,880 --> 03:48:45,360
The Israelites came to Samson and said, listen, Samson, you need to understand these people

3417
03:48:45,360 --> 03:48:46,360
rule over us.

3418
03:48:46,360 --> 03:48:48,240
The Philistines rule over us.

3419
03:48:48,240 --> 03:48:49,240
They're the government.

3420
03:48:49,240 --> 03:48:50,760
You need to obey the government.

3421
03:48:50,760 --> 03:48:52,560
And they're rebuking Samson.

3422
03:48:52,560 --> 03:48:55,940
But the Bible says that Samson was filled with the spirit of God.

3423
03:48:55,940 --> 03:48:57,240
And Samson brought freedom.

3424
03:48:57,240 --> 03:49:00,240
Now, he made mistakes along the way, obviously.

3425
03:49:00,240 --> 03:49:04,040
You know, his weakness was through women.

3426
03:49:04,040 --> 03:49:07,680
And that's what the government at the time, the Philistine government-

3427
03:49:07,680 --> 03:49:10,360
That was King David's weakness.

3428
03:49:10,360 --> 03:49:13,760
They exploited Samson's weakness of women.

3429
03:49:13,760 --> 03:49:17,040
But the Israelites are constantly telling Samson, you need to just shut up and do what

3430
03:49:17,040 --> 03:49:18,040
you're told.

3431
03:49:18,040 --> 03:49:19,040
These are our leaders.

3432
03:49:19,040 --> 03:49:20,040
These are our rulers.

3433
03:49:20,040 --> 03:49:22,680
And God's spirit was leading Samson to fight against the flu.

3434
03:49:22,680 --> 03:49:26,760
It's the same thing in Ezekiel where he says, God, they're going to kill me if I keep speaking

3435
03:49:26,760 --> 03:49:27,760
out.

3436
03:49:27,760 --> 03:49:28,760
But I can't help it.

3437
03:49:28,760 --> 03:49:29,760
It's burning in my bones.

3438
03:49:29,760 --> 03:49:30,760
Right.

3439
03:49:30,760 --> 03:49:31,760
Exactly.

3440
03:49:31,760 --> 03:49:32,760
Jeremiah, actually.

3441
03:49:32,760 --> 03:49:33,760
Yep.

3442
03:49:33,760 --> 03:49:34,760
Exactly.

3443
03:49:34,760 --> 03:49:35,760
Yeah, Jeremiah, you know, he finally-

3444
03:49:35,760 --> 03:49:36,760
But I mean, I think that's in Ezekiel, isn't it?

3445
03:49:36,760 --> 03:49:37,760
It's in Jeremiah.

3446
03:49:37,760 --> 03:49:42,820
But Jeremiah basically got frustrated with preaching and finally just said, I quit.

3447
03:49:42,820 --> 03:49:43,820
That's it.

3448
03:49:43,820 --> 03:49:45,040
And everybody was telling him to quit.

3449
03:49:45,040 --> 03:49:49,040
But then he said that the word of God was like a fire burning in his bones and he could

3450
03:49:49,040 --> 03:49:51,640
not stop preaching.

3451
03:49:51,640 --> 03:49:52,640
I believe you, I just-

3452
03:49:52,640 --> 03:49:55,280
That's the kind of preachers we need today.

3453
03:49:55,280 --> 03:49:56,280
We don't need-

3454
03:49:56,280 --> 03:49:57,280
That's Jeremiah.

3455
03:49:57,280 --> 03:49:58,880
Yeah, Jeremiah 20, verse 9.

3456
03:49:58,880 --> 03:50:06,880
We don't need these milk toast preachers that are prostitutes of propaganda of the federal

3457
03:50:06,880 --> 03:50:08,780
government lying to people.

3458
03:50:08,780 --> 03:50:15,320
We need people to preach the actual Bible stories and to take stands even that are unpopular

3459
03:50:15,320 --> 03:50:16,860
and to preach the truth today.

3460
03:50:16,860 --> 03:50:17,860
Because I tell you-

3461
03:50:17,860 --> 03:50:18,860
I just-

3462
03:50:18,860 --> 03:50:19,860
It's the pastors that are leading-

3463
03:50:19,860 --> 03:50:22,680
I just can't believe most people submit to evil just because they don't want to be looked

3464
03:50:22,680 --> 03:50:23,680
at bad by the world.

3465
03:50:23,680 --> 03:50:24,680
Right.

3466
03:50:24,680 --> 03:50:26,120
I mean, who cares what a bunch of idiots think about you?

3467
03:50:26,120 --> 03:50:27,840
Well, they crucified Jesus.

3468
03:50:27,840 --> 03:50:29,420
They killed all the prophets.

3469
03:50:29,420 --> 03:50:34,280
And you know, the thing about this movie after the tribulation is every Christian who's watching

3470
03:50:34,280 --> 03:50:35,420
it is convinced.

3471
03:50:35,420 --> 03:50:36,420
It's so clear.

3472
03:50:36,420 --> 03:50:39,200
When you show it to pastors, they're scared of it.

3473
03:50:39,200 --> 03:50:40,200
They don't want to accept-

3474
03:50:40,200 --> 03:50:45,160
Because they want their comfortable Cadillac and going to the cafeteria with a little-

3475
03:50:45,160 --> 03:50:48,680
And they're going to lose it if they take a stand on this because the pre-trib rapture

3476
03:50:48,680 --> 03:50:50,080
is the popular doctrine.

3477
03:50:50,080 --> 03:50:53,920
Well, what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul?

3478
03:50:53,920 --> 03:50:54,920
Exactly.

3479
03:50:54,920 --> 03:50:55,920
Yeah.

3480
03:50:55,920 --> 03:50:56,920
We'll be back with some more calls.

3481
03:50:56,920 --> 03:50:58,560
Nick and Nick lined up next.

3482
03:50:58,560 --> 03:51:00,560
Stay with us.

3483
03:51:00,560 --> 03:51:03,800
Hello, I'm Alex Jones.

3484
03:51:03,800 --> 03:51:10,080
Myself, my family, the Infowars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we

3485
03:51:10,080 --> 03:51:15,080
are intensifying our efforts against the globalist on every front.

3486
03:51:15,080 --> 03:51:20,720
Infowars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats, but we can't do that without

3487
03:51:20,720 --> 03:51:21,720
your help.

3488
03:51:21,720 --> 03:51:26,960
By getting the films, bumper stickers, and t-shirts at Infowars.com, you will wake up

3489
03:51:26,960 --> 03:51:33,000
people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.

3490
03:51:33,000 --> 03:51:36,460
We need your help to spread the word like never before.

3491
03:51:36,460 --> 03:51:42,680
They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.

3492
03:51:42,680 --> 03:51:50,120
You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization

3493
03:51:50,120 --> 03:51:51,680
and ultimate extermination.

3494
03:51:51,680 --> 03:51:54,040
The war is here.

3495
03:51:54,040 --> 03:51:55,880
It's an Infowar.

3496
03:51:55,880 --> 03:52:06,400
The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.

3497
03:52:06,400 --> 03:52:11,600
In the US, one in every 50 homes will have a break in this year.

3498
03:52:11,600 --> 03:52:13,680
Burglars call it smash and grab.

3499
03:52:13,680 --> 03:52:15,240
Police call it robbery.

3500
03:52:15,240 --> 03:52:17,140
We call it avoidable.

3501
03:52:17,140 --> 03:52:23,240
We are fake TV, a simple electronic device that can fool even professional burglars.

3502
03:52:23,240 --> 03:52:28,400
Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet and simulates the changing colors of a television.

3503
03:52:28,400 --> 03:52:33,240
To a burglar, it looks like someone must be home watching TV, so they'll likely move on

3504
03:52:33,240 --> 03:52:35,560
to an easier target.

3505
03:52:35,560 --> 03:52:40,800
At only $34.95, fake TV costs less than a month of most alarm monitoring plants and

3506
03:52:40,800 --> 03:52:43,360
it's perfect if you're traveling or away from home.

3507
03:52:43,360 --> 03:52:50,440
Order your fake TV by calling 877-5FAKETV or go to faketv.com.

3508
03:52:50,440 --> 03:52:56,600
That's 877-532-5388 or faketv.com.

3509
03:52:56,600 --> 03:53:04,680
Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.

3525
03:54:16,560 --> 03:54:20,800
We're going to go to Nick in California listening on XM 166 and one more Nick and we're out

3526
03:54:20,800 --> 03:54:21,800
of time.

3527
03:54:21,800 --> 03:54:25,520
But Pastor Anderson, you've been wanting to talk about Piers Morgan since you got here

3528
03:54:25,520 --> 03:54:28,760
and your take on that and you have a Bible scripture about that event.

3529
03:54:28,760 --> 03:54:29,760
Right.

3530
03:54:29,760 --> 03:54:33,840
So somebody sent me a link to your video of Piers Morgan and I just wanted to say that

3531
03:54:33,840 --> 03:54:37,880
I loved it because I know you were getting a lot of criticism, people saying you shouldn't

3532
03:54:37,880 --> 03:54:38,880
have gotten angry.

3533
03:54:38,880 --> 03:54:40,680
It was about 10%.

3534
03:54:40,680 --> 03:54:42,240
But let me tell you something.

3535
03:54:42,240 --> 03:54:45,680
We ought to get mad about evil.

3536
03:54:45,680 --> 03:54:47,040
And that's righteous indignation.

3537
03:54:47,040 --> 03:54:48,920
Jesus flipped over the tables.

3538
03:54:48,920 --> 03:54:53,360
I mean, yeah, we ought not get mad because of something small that, you know, our wife

3539
03:54:53,360 --> 03:54:54,360
squeezes.

3540
03:54:54,360 --> 03:54:56,520
Conscious evil is needs to be dealt with.

3541
03:54:56,520 --> 03:54:57,520
Read that verse.

3542
03:54:57,520 --> 03:54:58,520
Yeah.

3543
03:54:58,520 --> 03:54:59,520
So I found this verse for you.

3544
03:54:59,520 --> 03:55:00,520
Ecclesiastes 7-7.

3545
03:55:00,520 --> 03:55:06,200
It says, surely oppression maketh a wise man mad and a gift destroyeth the heart.

3546
03:55:06,200 --> 03:55:10,760
So the Bible says there that oppression makes a wise man mad.

3547
03:55:10,760 --> 03:55:12,000
And so it ought to make you mad.

3548
03:55:12,000 --> 03:55:15,680
Well, the media, the media, the staff tried to spin it like, oh, it was a defeat.

3549
03:55:15,680 --> 03:55:17,960
Alex got mad, but they don't have me back on.

3550
03:55:17,960 --> 03:55:18,960
They were scared.

3551
03:55:18,960 --> 03:55:19,960
They were upset.

3552
03:55:19,960 --> 03:55:20,960
They were shaking.

3553
03:55:20,960 --> 03:55:22,040
They were crying.

3554
03:55:22,040 --> 03:55:23,320
The head producer.

3555
03:55:23,320 --> 03:55:26,440
They know that they want to keep us in a calm coma.

3556
03:55:26,440 --> 03:55:27,440
Right.

3557
03:55:27,440 --> 03:55:28,440
They don't want us getting angry.

3558
03:55:28,440 --> 03:55:32,640
Well, and people get mad when preachers get mad and start yelling about sin.

3559
03:55:32,640 --> 03:55:37,440
Every preacher in the Bible yelled and raised his voice and and got mad and beat the pulpit.

3560
03:55:37,440 --> 03:55:39,000
That's the way the preachers in the Bible were.

3561
03:55:39,000 --> 03:55:40,640
Jesus was that way.

3562
03:55:40,640 --> 03:55:41,640
All of them.

3563
03:55:41,640 --> 03:55:43,920
But, you know, Jesus beat him with a whip.

3564
03:55:43,920 --> 03:55:44,920
Yeah.

3565
03:55:44,920 --> 03:55:46,560
He chased him out of the temple with a whip, flipped over the tables.

3566
03:55:46,560 --> 03:55:51,280
But, you know, every hair legged man that I know said that he loved that interview and

3567
03:55:51,280 --> 03:55:53,920
he loved to see somebody just take it to him.

3568
03:55:53,920 --> 03:55:56,320
Just just, you know, get mad.

3569
03:55:56,320 --> 03:55:59,400
And I mean, look, you were face to face with the enemy right there.

3570
03:55:59,400 --> 03:56:01,280
Oh, you should have seen it in the eye.

3571
03:56:01,280 --> 03:56:03,240
And you know, how can you not be angry?

3572
03:56:03,240 --> 03:56:06,240
The thing is, I'm real and he made me mad.

3573
03:56:06,240 --> 03:56:10,160
Let's go ahead and talk to Nick listening on XM, Nick in California.

3574
03:56:10,160 --> 03:56:11,160
You're on the air, Nick.

3575
03:56:11,160 --> 03:56:12,160
Go ahead.

3576
03:56:12,160 --> 03:56:13,160
Hi, Alex.

3577
03:56:13,160 --> 03:56:14,160
This is Nick.

3578
03:56:14,160 --> 03:56:15,160
Hey, buddy.

3579
03:56:15,160 --> 03:56:18,160
I'm calling about we're talking about religion and believing in God and everything, and I've

3580
03:56:18,160 --> 03:56:19,160
been praying a lot lately.

3581
03:56:19,160 --> 03:56:23,120
And I just wanted to bring this to your attention that maybe we could start a third party with

3582
03:56:23,120 --> 03:56:28,920
you in your camp and going back to his camp, because you both believe you both are against

3583
03:56:28,920 --> 03:56:29,920
abortion.

3584
03:56:29,920 --> 03:56:31,800
You're both against Agenda 21.

3585
03:56:31,800 --> 03:56:33,040
You both believe in God.

3586
03:56:33,040 --> 03:56:34,400
You both defend the Constitution.

3587
03:56:34,400 --> 03:56:38,560
Listen, Glenn Beck does a lot of really good work and he's gotten better over the years.

3588
03:56:38,560 --> 03:56:43,480
But he's done dirty tricks to us and I mean, I'm saying he is.

3589
03:56:43,480 --> 03:56:49,420
He's got some serious issues and he's always trying to paint it like I'm doing bad things

3590
03:56:49,420 --> 03:56:50,420
to people.

3591
03:56:50,420 --> 03:56:54,620
And look, I don't even attack Rush Limbaugh or people like Michael Savage or Sean Hannity.

3592
03:56:54,620 --> 03:56:58,000
I don't attack my quote competition because I'm not in competition with them.

3593
03:56:58,000 --> 03:56:59,840
I could care less about being a big shot.

3594
03:56:59,840 --> 03:57:01,000
I want to fight tyranny.

3595
03:57:01,000 --> 03:57:02,000
I'm risking my life.

3596
03:57:02,000 --> 03:57:06,880
And I wish Glenn would stop taking things out of context or twisting things.

3597
03:57:06,880 --> 03:57:10,440
And I'm glad he's been going in the right direction a lot.

3598
03:57:10,440 --> 03:57:12,020
And you want to say something, Pastor Anderson?

3599
03:57:12,020 --> 03:57:14,100
I don't like Glenn Beck at all.

3600
03:57:14,100 --> 03:57:15,720
And I do like you, Alex.

3601
03:57:15,720 --> 03:57:20,440
But to me, Glenn Beck is just too much of a neocon, Republican type.

3602
03:57:20,440 --> 03:57:22,520
And I- He's been getting better, though.

3603
03:57:22,520 --> 03:57:23,520
Has he?

3604
03:57:23,520 --> 03:57:25,840
Well, I quit listening to him, so I'm not seeing him.

3605
03:57:25,840 --> 03:57:29,720
Well, I think a lot of that's just like Gunners of America gets the NRA, to be honest.

3606
03:57:29,720 --> 03:57:30,720
That's what we're doing.

3607
03:57:30,720 --> 03:57:32,720
I mean, I hear stuff out of Limbaugh, him.

3608
03:57:32,720 --> 03:57:34,060
It's directly what I say.

3609
03:57:34,060 --> 03:57:35,060
And that's good.

3610
03:57:35,060 --> 03:57:37,520
I just, I really feel good when they rip me off.

3611
03:57:37,520 --> 03:57:39,160
But they twist it, so I don't like that.

3612
03:57:39,160 --> 03:57:40,480
Because wow, I'm getting a bigger megaphone.

3613
03:57:40,480 --> 03:57:42,440
I mean, that's me on the air now.

3614
03:57:42,440 --> 03:57:43,440
All those places.

3615
03:57:43,440 --> 03:57:46,880
I mean, that's really good, cuz I know we're forcing this stuff out there.

3616
03:57:46,880 --> 03:57:52,280
Well, it seemed like Glenn Beck was just trying to promote his fellow Mormon, Mitt Romney.

3617
03:57:52,280 --> 03:57:57,380
Well, he came out and attacked me when I went on Piers Morgan and said I was working with

3618
03:57:57,380 --> 03:57:58,380
him to discredit people.

3619
03:57:58,380 --> 03:58:00,920
Or what about in Police State Part 4?

3620
03:58:00,920 --> 03:58:03,560
Isn't there a whole- He says there's no FEMA camps.

3621
03:58:03,560 --> 03:58:04,680
There's no army plans.

3622
03:58:04,680 --> 03:58:05,680
It's all documented.

3623
03:58:05,680 --> 03:58:06,680
He says there isn't.

3624
03:58:06,680 --> 03:58:08,680
Well, does Glenn Beck stand for 9-11 truth?

3625
03:58:08,680 --> 03:58:12,600
Oh, he says Ron Paul supporters should have the army used against him.

3626
03:58:12,600 --> 03:58:16,520
Well, if he's not standing for 9-11 truth, then he's not standing for much as far as

3627
03:58:16,520 --> 03:58:18,400
a political talk show.

3628
03:58:18,400 --> 03:58:20,520
All right, listen, folks, we're out of time here.

3629
03:58:20,520 --> 03:58:21,520
Sorry to the other callers.

3630
03:58:21,520 --> 03:58:22,980
I wanted to go to Nick in Pennsylvania.

3631
03:58:22,980 --> 03:58:25,520
Last words from Nick in Pennsylvania, 30 seconds.

3632
03:58:25,520 --> 03:58:26,520
Take us out.

3633
03:58:26,520 --> 03:58:27,520
Nick, Nick.

3634
03:58:27,520 --> 03:58:31,840
Okay, Alex, I just wanted to say to you, God bless you.

3635
03:58:31,840 --> 03:58:34,840
God bless Pastor Anderson.

3636
03:58:34,840 --> 03:58:38,360
You, like Elvis, are a living legend.

3637
03:58:38,360 --> 03:58:39,720
No, no, you are.

3638
03:58:39,720 --> 03:58:42,760
See you this Sunday, 4 to 6 Central.

3639
03:58:42,760 --> 03:58:44,760
