8
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:07,640
segment here today more about why Max Keiser is going to be joining us and

00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:11,800
also Lloyd Chapman popping in Obama's considering shutting down the federal

00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:16,920
Small Business Bureau just amazing information I mean why even have it

11
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,680
there they already don't give the contracts of small businesses anyways

12
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,560
we're going to quick update on that continued destruction of our economy

13
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:27,320
while telling the public the government's doing everything it can to get

14
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:31,540
the economy going the name of the game is economic domination that's how we're

15
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:34,480
being dominated but the globalists want to back that up with a physical

16
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:40,120
domination sometimes I take off for three or four days and the so-called

17
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:46,240
vacation turns into more work than just you know staying at home but I was able

18
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:53,600
to take off three days and go down to Big Bend where I hadn't been in decades

19
00:01:53,600 --> 00:02:01,440
down on the Texas Mexico border in south west Texas very romantic scenery that

20
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:07,360
the desert speaks to a man's soul I guess just as the sea does and I just

21
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:13,360
had a lot of epiphanies clarification it's good to slow down sometimes and

22
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:19,560
and every time I do slow down I realize how much I do need to take a pit stop

23
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:26,720
just because then I'm more focused and and more clear and it's the same for

24
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,440
everybody but I feel completely rejuvenated and it's probably the high

25
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,720
mountain air and hiking up mountains and getting in the hot springs the natural

26
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,880
hot springs there by the Rio Grande and watching the Mexican ranchers ride

27
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:45,040
around on their horses look like right across the border look like something

28
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,120
right out of a Western just very romantic scenery and of course public

29
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,520
school educated people will think romantic means just like you take your

30
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,080
wife and do something romantic no I mean romantic of you for some people out

31
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,200
there who I know don't know what I mean by it cuz sometimes I get emails when

32
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:07,240
talking about something being romantic romantic the romantic novels or people

33
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:12,960
in ships and storms or astronauts going to the moon is romantic or beautiful

34
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:18,520
scenery or things that stir the heart and the soul that's romantic and just

35
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:23,760
very very good for the soul also there's no Wi-Fi there and cell phones don't

36
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,920
work anywhere but up close to the top of mountains I'd have to get up on a high

37
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,960
up on a mountain and sit there and transmit with my cell phones the two

38
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:37,200
videos I did shoot while I was there to the town 30 miles away at night with the

39
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,360
little blinking lights far away line of sight just amazing technology I'm gonna

40
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,540
attempt to get into all of the news when we come back and it's just more of the

41
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:52,280
same more confirmation of just how much trouble we're in but more facets of the

42
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:58,760
enemy as more detail is filled in as it gets closer and closer back to

43
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:02,880
in many cases the tyranny is not close anymore it's sitting on top of us

44
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:09,440
spitting in our faces it is all over even mainstream news that Western

45
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:14,040
governments are really running the al-qaeda groups in Africa who are

46
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:18,640
blowing up chemical plants and taking hostages and things like that

47
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:24,480
the african invasion was shut up four years ago even before Obama was put into

48
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:29,040
office four and a half years ago that's why he's the black face so they can sell

49
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,440
that so the left won't say anything cuz I mean he's black it must be okay and

50
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,720
they just use that as an emotional cover for what they're doing but it's pretty

51
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,400
amazing headline London Independent terror in North Africa our Westerners

resistance you are listening to the Alex Jones show

89
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:39,760
ladies and gentlemen I am your host Alex Jones I am a defender of Liberty I am

90
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:46,200
very upset about the tyrants that are taking over our planet and I am very

91
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:51,280
disgusted by their open attacks on all of our basic liberties not just the

92
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:55,800
Second Amendment and that's why I'm on air to try to set brush fires in the

93
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:02,520
minds of men and women everywhere to defend their freedoms that were hard

94
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:08,240
fought and hard won by our forebears now remember the United States

95
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,560
geographically is really a small country and we've only been five percent of the

96
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:17,400
world's population roughly in the last hundred years those numbers have stayed

97
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,600
about steady we're currently about five and a half percent of the world's

98
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:26,920
population but we had half of the world's wealth half of the world's

99
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:34,280
wealth and now we're losing that wealth why did five percent of the world's

100
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:39,160
population have half the wealth because we kicked the royalty out we kicked the

101
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:44,600
monopolies out we kicked the power combines out who always take over and

102
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:50,200
always seek to make everyone else poor and dependent and then incredible

103
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:56,400
poverty always follows that is what these oligarchs do that's what they set

104
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:01,640
up in the Mesoamerican kingdoms in Central and South America and southern

105
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:06,760
North America the Aztecs the Toltecs the whole Mayan culture that's what the

106
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:11,960
ancient Babylonians establishment it's what the Egyptians established it's what

107
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:18,240
the Romans established it's what every other culture establishes a form of

108
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:25,160
feudalism it is not an accident that they're trying to make us poor this is a

109
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:34,880
designed global engineered program all right I have got so much news that I

110
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:40,920
want to cover here today since I was out Friday Sunday and Monday and I want to

111
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:47,760
just thank Paul Joseph Watson and of course Mike Adams Rappaport and others

112
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:52,920
and the crew they all did a great job driving back from Big Ben yesterday when

113
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:58,240
I was able to get internet I tuned into the iPhone app and listened to large

114
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:07,880
portions of of Friday's transmission and just amazing information with Mike

115
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:15,440
Adams on that broadcast and obviously I called in on Thursdays or or Friday show

116
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:24,800
myself but there is just so much to cover and so let me just go over some of

117
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,160
the some of the headlines that we're going to be talking about here today

118
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:35,240
Nobel Prize nominee Obama asked military leaders if they will fire on US citizens

119
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:45,760
shot claim purported to come from one of America's foremost military heroes and

120
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,760
Paul then links to the army training manual from 2010 where they have begun

121
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:54,200
to openly train to take on American gun owners and confiscate our firearms

122
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:59,760
trainings predates that but now it's public and so I mean my point is why

123
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,720
even go with the claim even though we're tracking down this individual to get

124
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:08,800
them on I mean it's all right there out in the open already that's what Homeland

125
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,160
Security is as a system to wage war against American gun owners so we're

126
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:18,360
going to be going over that report also Obama's inaugural address Second

127
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:24,720
Amendment is obsolete he says that when the times change so must we I guess

128
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,480
we're going back to ancient Rome where slaves were disarmed so we've got that

129
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:36,240
report CNN communist Network trying to shove gun control down our throats we're

130
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,840
going to go over some of that new push and some more good news CBS news

131
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:46,120
reporting Missouri sheriff's sheriff's whole bunch of them pledge not to enforce

132
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:51,240
Obama's gun control law saying they're unconstitutional that's also being

133
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:55,680
reported by NBC

134
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:00,240
we now have

135
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:06,240
Texas sheriff's coming out and saying the same thing so it is spreading you

136
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,760
see the sheriff is a constitutional office

137
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:15,600
and sheriff's are elected representatives and sheriff's in an

138
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,840
emergency are the head honcho in the county they can actually declare

139
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:26,280
martial law but instead you've got the federal government trying to dissolve

140
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:33,920
sheriff's through the states trying to offer money if the counties and if the

141
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,400
cities will get together

142
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:44,080
and either get rid of the sheriff outright or if they can't do that make

143
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:49,440
them unelected and a creature of the system we're going to be going over that

144
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,880
report today and then coming up after I've had a chance to get into the Second

145
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,200
Amendment attack the latest developments there in the economy we're going to

146
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,960
cover the London Independent and several other mainstream articles terror in North

147
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:06,720
Africa our Westerners pulling strings and the Algerian Prime Minister has come

148
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,960
out and said basically these are white commandos commanding a bunch of jihadis

149
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:16,520
taking people hostage and blowing things up and then the West gets to go in and

150
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:22,400
invade the commandos pull out and the West then attacks empty facilities but

151
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:27,240
then gets to occupy in the name of defeating an enemy and and that's what

152
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,960
al-qaeda has always been it's a stimulant but the globalist have attack

153
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:34,640
or take the blame for an attack it's actually carried out by Western powers

154
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:38,840
the criminal elements that run us and and then you have the excuse to invade

155
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:43,160
and take over the region and every African country has either had a US

156
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:49,560
troops or NATO troops under Afrikan added to it or they've built up on the

157
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:55,000
borders of those countries and of course we told you an Obama deception at length

158
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,560
that there would be a major invasion of Africa to take over all of the natural

159
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:05,640
resources not already controlled by the West and it is neo-colonialism but

160
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:11,240
remember you don't get the stolen goods the stolen goods are used to be shipped

161
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:16,440
to China to be produced there under a monopoly deal where the West gets the

162
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:21,360
rare earths and gives it to China and then they use that to deindustrialize

163
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,960
the West so a lot of good old boys go well you know what let's go take it from

164
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:28,800
the Africans or let's go take the oil from the Muslims and that's actually

165
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,200
used to increase prices in fact if you go back to 1990 the real reason the UN

166
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:37,280
and the US was mad at Saddam who had worked for the quote United States and

167
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:41,960
attacking Iran and he was actually put into power by the CIA that's all

168
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:46,240
declassified congressional hearings on record he was actually a CIA trained

169
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:52,520
assassin in his when he was in his 20s and and then the US helped install a new

170
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,960
government he became the head of security then he helped run a Western

171
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:59,920
backed coup in 79 and then he was told go ahead and attack Iran and given

172
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,960
upwards of 40 billion dollars and and Saddam then wanted to become

173
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:09,520
independent kind of like Hosni Mubarak another puppet in Egypt and he actually

174
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:14,160
wanted to build up Iraq you say what you want about him but he did women got to

175
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,000
go to university they put rock and roll music on the radio Playboy in the stores

176
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,640
and not even saying that's a good thing but that's you know it was freedom

177
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:26,280
certainly I'm not saying you shouldn't be able to get Playboy or have rock and

178
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:31,600
roll my point is is that is that is that is that they westernized and they became

179
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,560
very wealthy and he stopped all the ethnic fighting that was going on and so

180
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,760
they set Saddam up and told him go ahead and invade quite we were not gonna get

181
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:43,160
involved you're our ally we don't get involved in inter-arab affairs that had

182
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:47,960
been his cues eight years before to attack Iran in the seven-year Iran Iraq

183
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:52,520
war so he went along with that so here's the problem with each article each each

184
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:56,960
each each little point I said I get to this later turns into a whole larger

185
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:01,640
story of what's happening and what's crazy is this is all publicly admitted

186
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:05,040
it's just not generally known just like a general public does not know the three

187
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:09,840
branches of government or does not know what sodium chloride is that's why most

188
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:15,200
surveys they say ban it it's of course salt or hydrogen dioxide most people in

189
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:19,640
surveys say ban that because it sounds scary it's it's water the people perish

190
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,960
for lack of knowledge the truth will set you free knowledge is power all those

191
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:28,960
maxims are so true and so central it's why I restate them so my point is

192
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:35,640
getting back to you don't get the goods of the spoils Saddam's big crime in 1990

193
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:40,640
and 1991 was he was paying off his 40 billion dollar debt and he was doing it

194
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,960
by flooding the market with oil and if you'll remember I mean gas was something

195
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:50,360
like what was gas prices pre pre-war it was something like 50 cents for just a

196
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,960
ridiculous number you could pull that number up I know it was way under a dollar

197
00:17:53,960 --> 00:18:01,920
now yeah 60 cents double-check that though I know your memories right mines

198
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:06,280
right yeah I was like 60 65 cents pre Desert Shield then it jacked up to a

199
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:10,400
dollar fifty or something and again you know the good old boys are like get that

200
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,760
oil get them Arabs oil ever gonna get it oh you got it all right

201
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,960
Saddam was flooding the market in a free market with oil to pay off his debts

202
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,640
OPEC went completely ape it was all over the Wall Street Journal I was even

203
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:28,440
reading it at the time you know I was in high school and I remember watching the

204
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,580
news because I was into CNN and c-span and I mean I was following it and I

205
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:37,520
remember that I remember that gas was 55 60 65 cent spending on where you lived

206
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:42,320
and then shot way over a dollar fifty once the war or even once the Desert

207
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:48,320
Shield started but my point is now you pay you know close to four bucks in many

208
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:53,920
areas so let me explain something when our troops go and back up other groups

209
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:58,800
to take over and destabilize African countries and when all this happens

210
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:03,040
you're not going to get any of the goods you pay to get the bankers the resources

211
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:09,080
and then they all use it to leverage the market to consolidate and destroy the

212
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,880
market because they're in an act of economic scorched earth total takeover

213
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,400
so we have these articles where as we told you they're using al-qaeda to

214
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:24,320
attack all over Africa and then the US military and NATO and the French and the

215
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,680
rest of them go in there under the cover of African invading the whole place and

216
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:32,600
even the African leaders are going these are blonde haired blue-eyed men with

217
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:37,500
with English accents they are attacking no we do not want you you you are doing

218
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:43,120
it no oh no we're invading because al-qaeda took US citizens hostage and

219
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,680
the whole thing is a theater deal and that happened with the invasion of

220
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,840
Panama remember that that turned out that was all staged there were no

221
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:55,320
hostages at the University same deal this is purely manufactured everywhere

222
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,360
we'll be right back stay with us

223
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:05,200
looking back on 2012 we asked ourselves how did we ever survive from natural

224
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,320

on the GCN radio network

276
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:16,640
you know I could have just simplified everything I covered in the last segment

277
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:23,800
and said Shaddam Hussein's big crime was that he was over pumping oil in 1990 to

278
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:28,440
pay off his debts to the West and they were telling him OPEC and the West was

279
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:32,560
saying stop doing that you're making oil prices too low we want to gouge people

280
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:36,000
and he said no I'm gonna pay my debts off first he said well then forgive my

281
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,360
debts or cut them I want to be a sovereign country and they said no

282
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:43,760
you're going to be under globalist control again we're conquered by these

283
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:49,160
foreign international mega banks foreign is even the word global outside the law

284
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:55,400
mafias who brag that they've conquered us and they'll go put people like Saddam

285
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:59,940
in or Hazi Mubarak and then later set them up and bring them down to

286
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:05,580
destabilize the country to have a civil war to destroy its economy so they can

287
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:10,020
come in and buy it up for pennies on the dollar and it's in the IMF World Bank

288
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:14,160
documents that got released when Joseph stick let's quit the World Bank in 2002

289
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:20,100
now ten plus years ago hard to believe time is flying that that fast see that's

290
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:23,680
why I'm frustrated I know how cold-blooded the globalist are I mean

291
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:29,060
these are military financial conquerors these are hardcore systematic

292
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:35,680
mechanized corporate criminals who hate the free market and want a global

293
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:41,440
monopoly run by them and then I've got to sit there and watch Joe Biden on TV

294
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:46,080
going we can't let one more child die not one more and then that way when one

295
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:50,360
more gets killed by a gun see another one see it's your fault putting that

296
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:56,000
guilt on us well how about just never be born then never drive a car I never have

297
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,160
emotions well that's their goal for the general public is to turn us into

298
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:06,240
biological androids to turn us under the new freedom initiative into a bunch of

299
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,760
drugged out zombies and that's only in the interim phase while we're being

300
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:15,080
phased out as the establishment goes to robotics and automation and that's their

301
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:19,600
words whether that really works or not whether this plan actually will succeed

302
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:24,040
people think oh man you know you claim this is happening this is not my claim

303
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:28,680
this is the establishment all they talk about their hundred plus year plan that

304
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:33,840
they're following and let me tell you it leads to a very horrible place see I'm

305
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:39,480
not telling you what I think is going to happen I'm not fans think I'm super

306
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:44,160
smart and that man how does he keep knowing what's going to happen and then

307
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:48,400
my detractors think I'm up here like writing science fiction on the air

308
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:55,080
telling you what I imagine is going to happen because it's so fantastical and

309
00:26:55,080 --> 00:27:01,400
it's neither one I've read hundreds of books and probably over a thousand

310
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:05,700
different white papers put out by the CFR put out by the Club of Rome you say

311
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:09,560
where are they what is the endgame.com has a bibliography on that film great

312
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:13,560
place to start watch my films I make a claim I show you the bill I show you the

313
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:18,360
document I go to the UT library and get the Club of Rome publication 1966

314
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:22,800
I show you where they say they're going to end the family

315
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:27,000
I show you where they say they're going to break down all of society and make us

316
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,840
basically drugged up brainwashed idiots before they release the control bio

317
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:37,520
plagues and wipe almost all of us out I show you the the training videos they

318
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:43,000
show kids in the UK about the planned Opelis and people watch it who aren't

319
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,520
children and think this is a satirical joke of a futuristic police state the

320
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:52,040
planned Opelis it's not it's an association with mainstream television

321
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:55,880
and newspapers and the British government putting out videos for kids

322
00:27:55,880 --> 00:28:01,560
where mommy's the boss robots tell you what you can do daddy's a joke and no

323
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:04,560
one's allowed to go outside without government authorization and you never

324
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:08,600
get meat anymore and you live in giant compact cities and anybody else that

325
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:13,920
won't lives in these giant urban controlled slums or drones surveil

326
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:19,520
everyone you go well that's the 1970s judge dread judge dread is only writing

327
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:23,440
about what the globalist actually plan you see that's what you've got to get

328
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:31,920
folks is that it's not art that that life is then imitating it is life that

329
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:37,800
art is imitating and it's so frustrating that these globalist want to take us to

330
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:41,760
this ugly place are doing everything they can to hurt us and then I've got to

331
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:48,600
sit there and see Time magazine the gun fighters and on the cover of it it shows

332
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:57,480
Biden Bloomberg and shooting victim Giffords and you know what's interesting

333
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:01,160
is she was pro-gun before she got it she pretty much still is I don't know how

334
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:07,120
they gotta be part of this I guess she's been obviously injured shot in the head

335
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:13,480
but the point is is that we're now going to they're the gun fighters they know

336
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:17,520
there's that romantic idea of Americana and guns so they turn it around these

337
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:22,440
are the gun fighters they're trying to take your guns actually they are arming

338
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:26,200
themselves the government is they are buying a billion six bullets they are

339
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:30,000
buying the armored vehicles they are training to make war against us while

340
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:36,000
collapsing the society they are the gun fighters they're coming with the guns

341
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,720
they're wearing the black hats not Giffords the puppet but the other two

342
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:45,320
certainly Bloomberg is the chief leader for the foreign banks in Wall Street to

343
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:50,120
dominate and disarm us so we can be fully occupied these are conquerors we're

344
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:58,400

00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:15,040

383
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:08,640
I was trained in firearms I carried a concealed weapon I made the

384
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:13,480
determination that if somebody was going to try to take me out I was going to

385
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:20,680
take them with me if I could have gotten 51 votes in the

386
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:26,480
Senate of the United States for an outright ban picking up every one of

387
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:33,720
them mr. and mrs. America turn them all in I would have done it defending the

388
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:40,720
Republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's Alex Jones

389
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,680
okay we're gonna get to a clip coming up in a little while of Obama saying

390
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:49,320
basically abolish the Second Amendment and the article on the text is up at

391
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:54,400
info Wars calm but if you're a radio listener I'm looking at the cover of

392
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:58,000
Time magazine the gun fighters kind of billionaire a vice president and a

393
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:03,120
shooting survivor stop the violence now imagine human violence has never stopped

394
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,640
if they really wanted to stop the violence Obama would have said

395
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:14,600
serotonin reuptake inhibitors and other psychotropics have been involved in 99

396
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:21,800
percent of these mass shootings and he would go on to say guns are good we've

397
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:26,860
seen a 49 percent the last 20 years FBI statistics from the local governments

398
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:30,960
very accurate numbers that's why they hide them

399
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:38,600
49 percent drop in crimes using guns 21 percent drop in the same period on

400
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:42,560
overall violent crime we've shown you those numbers at nauseum go to fbi.gov

401
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:46,840
and just go into it there's thousands of pages it'll blow you away all compiled

402
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:51,360
locally very accurate numbers murders muggings carjackings you name it I mean

403
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:56,760
imagine the level of this hoax imagine the level of what we're talking about

404
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:00,120
can they stop the violence and you notice they all keep saying we can never

405
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:04,400
have one more child shot I mean that's ridiculous never have one more child

406
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:08,600
dying a car wreck one more child drowned I mean the numbers like 15 something

407
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,600
times drowned every year would die from guns we're gonna ban swimming pools

408
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:17,320
gonna ban showers gonna ban people fall every day in every I mean it's more

409
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:20,160
probably every hour I mean the number is in the tens of thousands every year

410
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:26,040
falling and hitting their heads in the bathtub and dying but again they

411
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:30,280
emotionalize it they hype it they they stand on the graves of the children

412
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:34,600
Obama uses the children like human shields to sell his agenda and says I'll

413
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:39,760
get it done for you it is over the top that's why I get so angry but they're

414
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:43,280
targeting well-meaning dumbed-down Americans that like come on you care

415
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:47,840
about the kids right let's take the guns for them oh I guess you're right

416
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,800
but Bill Clinton came out over the weekend I thought we have a video clip

417
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:55,840
up at info wars calm saying don't trivialize the gun culture these people

418
00:35:55,840 --> 00:36:02,640
are hard to beat and they're getting mobilized because we understand it's the

419
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:07,360
final straw it's the bellwether it's the canary in the coal mine it shows the

420
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:16,920
system is going for broke absolutely going for broke in a big way

421
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:21,200
on every front and of course they're going after our liberties on every front

422
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:24,960
and our forebears warned us about this over and over again and history has

423
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:29,920
shown in other nations what this means that's why it's such a big deal and

424
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,920
while they want to control the debate they're not controlling the debate and

425
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:38,280
this is how wars happen because we're committed to our cause they're committed

426
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:41,960
to theirs that's why I want to talk to those in the middle the police and

427
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:45,300
military and say to you you're being trained to take our guns that's now

428
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:48,640
public you're being trained that veterans and gun owners and George

429
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:53,280
Washington are bad guys that's public now as well think of how otherworldly and

430
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:58,640
ridiculous that is and how absurdist but it's really happening

431
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:02,960
because they have to demonize us ahead of this civil war they want to start and

432
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:07,480
that's what Homeland Security I saw an article yesterday Aaron Dykes covered it

433
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:12,520
so the dead David Ortiz on the news where they said Oh nationwide they're

434
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:17,040
gonna put gunshot detectors up for Homeland Security to detect shooters and

435
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:22,040
I went and looked it up and sure enough it's microphones see oh we're gonna spy

436
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:28,200
on you cuz of guns but we're listening to you as well oh

437
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:31,920
everybody's got to go get a psychiatric evaluation and the government will

438
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:35,040
decide if you're mentally ill and by the way it's mentally ill to want to own a

439
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,800
gun notice you hear that and gun owners are Nazis and gun owners are clan

440
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:42,800
members and gun owners help kill the kids at Sandy Hook and gun owners are

441
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:47,680
scum and gun owners are trash and gun owners are filth I mean you're seeing

442
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:53,000
Bob Shafer we defeated Hitler we can defeat the gun owners CBS news and a

443
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,720
normal informed person goes man that that that's discrediting not if we don't

444
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:03,040
resist it to say how dare you they will normalize the idea that we are criminals

445
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:09,640
inherently because we own guns I mean that tells you how bad these

446
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:13,280
people are that every FEMA training manual and I've got video of it in road

447
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:17,040
to tyranny it's online they go and tell police and police have called in you've

448
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:20,840
heard them yeah no we get sent to training especially the officers you

449
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:24,120
know the sergeant sent up where they sit around for three days they send them off

450
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:29,560
to these resorts and the feds come in and they sit there and badmouth America

451
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:35,040
and tell them how bad America is I mean there's the enemy right there

452
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:39,320
imagine a movie where you know the feds call in the cops and go the founding

453
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:43,680
fathers are bad guns are bad families are bad you can't trust people that talk

454
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:47,760
about wanting sovereignty they're the enemy we've got a train to take their

455
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:51,600
guns I mean right there folks use the bad guy right there is the foreign

456
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:56,600
operative I mean it's so over the top but that's how tyrannies are Joseph

457
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:01,080
Goebbels Nazi propaganda minister and I've read many of his writings said over

458
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:05,840
and over again and he admired Edward Bernays u.s. propagandists but admired

459
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:09,120
him but wanted to kill him it was declassified they had plans that when

460
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:13,280
they took the u.s. by having a occupy government like you don't just come have

461
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:16,480
the French stand down you don't just have the American stand down they were

462
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,560
going to have a deal with an American government with Senator Bush Prescott

463
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:24,280
Bush this came out in McCormick Dickstein hearings we can read the

464
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:28,660
congressional record they were gonna have him and others led by Smedley

465
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:32,080
Butler as the president the two-time Congressional Medal of Honor winner two

466
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:36,000
star general who had very high approval ratings they were gonna have him as the

467
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,600
new dictator and he said listen I'm not gonna do that and help stop it but it

468
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:44,360
was so incredible it would have brought the whole system down so they they shut

469
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:49,360
it down and nobody went to jail except German spies who were actually German

470
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:53,920
again this is history when you know this there's no going back that's how the

471
00:39:53,920 --> 00:40:00,000
bankers have taken over is with collaborators but it's a corporate

472
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,480
takeover they've gotten very sophisticated the British Empire in the

473
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:07,040
last hundred years started losing militarily so they said we'll go into

474
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:11,000
the US we'll set up the CFR we'll take over their government not for the

475
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:18,400
British people the British corporate imperial model after World War one they

476
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,440
said we can't beat the Germans they've got all the science all the technology

477
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:25,240
they call it the German problem in their newspapers and Lord Milner said this was

478
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:30,440
in public newspapers he said we need to fund radicals in Germany help them

479
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:35,320
basically have a civil war which Germany had in the streets we'll put radicals in

480
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:39,280
and then we'll destroy them we'll give them weapons encourage them to attack

481
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:44,760
Europe after they wreck Europe we'll then take over this is all good go look

482
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:50,440
it up it was in the cover the front page of the Times of London I've read it the

483
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:58,680
online scans this was in all our newspapers at the time

484
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:05,640
just like they put Saddam in just like they create al-qaeda just like they're

485
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:10,440
trying to radicalize the militias and get us led by feds inside militias to

486
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:16,200
start an offensive fight they tried to start a civil war in 1993 and then again

487
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:21,400
in 95 but the police wouldn't go along with it so they couldn't fully carry it

488
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:25,640
out that's why they're trying to federalize see they they they know what

489
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:30,200
they're doing again I had family who were colonels and

490
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:37,200
people in the Confederacy but that doesn't mean that I was for the

491
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:44,880
Confederacy the Confederacy was a tyranny but so was Lincoln see see it's

492
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:49,880
not that one side was good one side was bad the south was wronged on tariffs

493
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:54,680
that ripped off the south and not the north tariffs on on on agricultural

494
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:59,720
goods not on finished goods not on industrial goods the taxes were wrong

495
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:04,400
there's a lot of stuff went on but the point and of course Lincoln was a tyrant

496
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:09,520
but he believed he was doing good the British came in and publicly financed

497
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:16,280
the south to to and of course the north went along with the manipulation and

498
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:21,720
and started the war with the south again the problem is it's all history if you

499
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:26,920
just knew history folks you'd understand how this works now Obama is different

500
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:31,040
he's not like Lincoln who was just trying to maintain control and went to

501
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:35,360
tyranny and then didn't and of course then Lincoln didn't want to abuse the

502
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:39,080
south with reconstruction so they killed him because they wanted the very same

503
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:43,640
interest one to loot the south the globalist want crime

504
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:53,000
the globalist want control the the globalist want chaos and they want a

505
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,760
civil war in this country and Ron Paul agrees with me it will cause a civil war

506
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:00,280
when they come for the guns it's guaranteed and they know that and the

507
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:04,040
only way to stop them is to go look we know you want to start a civil war we

508
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:07,520
know you're foreign occupiers we know what you're doing we know you're

509
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:12,280
illegitimate like the Vichy French again they didn't want to tell people in our

510
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:15,560
history books that the French see everybody says the French gave up in two

511
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:20,800
weeks there was only a few army groups that fought back in the French ninety

512
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:26,160
plus percent stood down and became the new Vichy French government run out of

513
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:30,440
Vichy France it was only the British that really fought a small expeditionary

514
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:36,320
group that then ran to Dunkirk and you had the famous evacuation and Hitler

515
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:40,200
still had a treaty with England that he thought they were going to follow to

516
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:43,840
divide up Europe with him that's how they set him up so Albert sphere of the

517
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:48,120
the vice Fuhrer the vice president flew over and parachuted in to meet with the

518
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:51,360
Lord who'd made the agreement with him that's why they locked him up in the

519
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:55,640
Tower of London never letting him talk to the media till he died

520
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:59,880
oh you didn't know about the treaty England had with Hitler see folks this

521
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:05,160
is all on the record but they won't put it on History Channel they put some of

522
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:09,640
it on there our government put Mao Zedong into power now declassified

523
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:15,820
John Birch society said that in the 50s declassified six years ago on History

524
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:20,180
Channel talking to the ancient CIA section chief about putting now in in

525
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:23,880
49 of course but you can't tell Americans that's the act like you're not

526
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:29,800
friends until the 70s when ambassador Bush is sent over to make the deal then

527
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:33,440
they use the Chinese slaves to leverage out the West and de-industrialize us

528
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:36,880
consolidating power again

529
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:43,360
and it's understanding all of this that will help us beat these globalist and so

530
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:46,600
that's why people are like come on Alex don't you want some sensible gun control

531
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:50,840
quotes you come part way yeah they always want us to give in something and

532
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:56,080
then we never give anything to them it they try to act reasonable all day these

533
00:44:56,080 --> 00:45:04,120
are craven gangsters and their dupes who are coming after us and so I get

534
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:11,440
mobilized I get angry I get upset it is not my wish to be up here at the tip of

535
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:15,840
the spear it is not a very safe position to be in but there is no future if we

536
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:18,060
don't beat these people let's go to some of these clips and then I'm gonna

537
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:21,600
premiere an amazing special report put together by Aaron Dykes and crew

538
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:26,160
founding fathers battle globalists from the grave we're gonna premiere this

539
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:30,520
special report here on air that everyone needs to see it hasn't been uploaded to

540
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:34,340
YouTube and high res yet I'm gonna have it uploaded the Alex Jones channel as

541
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:39,160
soon as we can in high res there's a medium res version out there but I want

542
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:42,820
to promote the high res one because it's such an important report and make it the

543
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:48,320
featured video as soon as it's available but I've told you many times before this

544
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:51,960
new piers Morgan thing happened that every time I'm at the DNC covering an

545
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:57,080
event or every time I'm covering anarchist hired by the police every time

546
00:45:57,080 --> 00:46:00,360
I'm at a so-called liberal event when the cameras off they'll come over and

547
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:06,520
grab me by the arm hoping I do something so the cops can arrest me I mean we've

548
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:09,360
caught the police working with the anarchists countless times and it's been

549
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:14,040
on record in Denver and other places they do this and they'll tell me they go

550
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:18,720
when we take over you're dead and I'll go so you you're here with the police

551
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:22,040
you'll see the cops watching ten feet away on little yeah you bet we are you

552
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:26,160
punk I've even had them punch me in the back and then I turn around and see the

553
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:31,480
cops waiting and then I know to control myself and Mike Hansen even caught some

554
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:36,920
of this on tape at the G it was the Forbes meeting I guess back in 99 here

555
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:42,640
in Austin but the point is is I've told you about this and you've also heard the

556
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:46,320
quote Democrats talk about how you know I want to kill this person I want to

557
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:51,960
kill that person Alec Baldwin and others I've actually been at the cocktail

558
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:54,960
parties of these people occasionally when I got invited into things when I

559
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:58,720
was against Bush not because I'm a socialist but because Bush was doing some

560
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:02,760
bad things they were so politically tribal that I would get invited in

561
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:07,360
Austin and New York and LA to cocktail parties with famous designers and

562
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:12,320
Hollywood folks and they they sit around talking about how they want to kill

563
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:17,520
conservatives and how disgusting the family is I mean this is what goes on

564
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:20,080
with these people

565
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:25,760
and so when I got there and in the day after I was on Piers Morgan they had

566
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:30,120
Piers Morgan and two of his guests talk about how how I need to be shot and

567
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:34,160
killed and how and how Piers Morgan will dress up in a uniform to do it I mean

568
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:38,520
only a criminal psychology would come up with that yes you'll wear a uniform he's

569
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:44,960
like yes I'll put on a uniform when I do it and you know it's the model you know

570
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:51,760
daughter of the ambassador Huntsman along with the Daily Beast writer and

571
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:56,320
Piers Morgan a Buzz Bissinger talking about you'll wear uniforms you do it

572
00:47:56,320 --> 00:48:01,080
yeah yeah I mean folks when you know criminology it's like whoa whoa

573
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:05,160
fantasizing about dressing up in uniform see it's the state's their power they

574
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:10,320
they step into the state and then it gives them all this power

575
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:15,880
and then we found another clip that's up at infowars.com a Paul Watson article

576
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:20,960
Piers Morgan used machine guns to take out critics and and then we get the

577
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:26,680
weatherman videos and this was confirmed in federal court and many of them pled

578
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:30,720
guilty to this they're in meetings saying we're gonna take over put 50

579
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:35,520
million in camps kill 25 mil and they lick their stinking lips folks these are

580
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:40,560
these are psychopaths these are fantasy killers because they're weak

581
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:45,560
these people are sheltered sheltered it's been proven historically and Victor

582
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:50,640
Hugo wrote about it prosperity makes monsters adversity makes men he actually

583
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:55,440
said adversity makes men prosperity makes monsters I flip his quote and it's

584
00:48:55,440 --> 00:49:00,440
true these people that's why cultures like Rome at the end where the Emperor's

585
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:04,080
were so decadent and disconnected from reality we're like kill him kill them

586
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:08,600
you know kill kill kill because they're just spoiled brats and to them it's real

587
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:13,000
sexy to talk about killing somebody that's why elites always get so decadent

588
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,960
and sick so here's Piers Piers Morgan the first time talking about how they

589
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:21,160
want to kill me and then we found a new clip how they want to kill all of us see

590
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:24,440
they want to kill you you have to understand they want to kill you in the

591
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:28,160
rape your wife not these people specifically individually but that's

592
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:32,280
where this leads that's what tyrants end up doing here it is but what do you need

593
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:36,960
a semi-automatic weapon for the only reason I think you need it is Pierce

594
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:41,680
challenge Alex Jones to a boxing match show up with a semi-automatic that you

595
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:48,480
got legally and pop them I'd love to see that and then Pierce goes goes y'all

596
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:51,600
wear my brother's uniform so again these guys are low-level minions they just

597
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:55,280
fantasize about you know shooting me but the higher level ones not not not these

598
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:59,400
little guys but history shows they want to burn cities loot take over let's go

599
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:02,720
out to break with this next Piers Morgan clip here he is talking about killing

600
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:07,720
all of us here it is Trini and in his like all of Britain's got talent they'll

601
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:10,520
do the respective kind of things that they're supposed to focus for you know

602
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:14,200
lots of us ranting about green credentials his love to sake jokes

603
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:17,600
Trini talking about what you guys are wearing how do you mark them how would

604
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:21,360
you scale them what I do is I've replaced the buzzers with a machine gun

605
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:25,480
and just take them all out and do the public a massive favor what I do is I've

606
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:29,040
replaced the buzzers with a machine gun and just take them all out and do the

607
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:33,840
public a massive favor there you go now now again Piers Morgan himself I was

608
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:37,880
saying not his guest but Piers Morgan mass death and he's dead serious and

609
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:41,800
he's biting his lip and he's getting excited and that's why physically when I

610
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:46,600
was around him I got very angry at a primitive level that's why I challenged

611
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:50,240
him I mean I you know I was like you think you're tough buddy I want to be

612
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:54,280
the champion of Liberty I'll stand against you I know who you are I know

613
00:50:54,280 --> 00:51:01,960
who you are you you rapacious would-be mass murderer if you've ever wanted one

614
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:05,960
of our best-selling generators but we're waiting for an offer so crazy you

615
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:09,280
couldn't refuse then you're not gonna want to miss this exciting message

616
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:14,080
here's why our solar generators provide life-saving electrical power and unlike

617
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:18,520

641
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:13,880
2010 then I learned about RNA drops I learned that 97% of my DNA that

642
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:17,920
scientists have called junk is actually packed with millions of gene switches

that play a critical role in controlling how my cells organs and other tissues

644
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:26,280

you

653
00:54:46,280 --> 00:55:06,600
better get that through your head this world is ruled by violence

654
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:10,840
and a man's gonna do what a man's got to do

655
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:15,080
look here's the bottom line folks if you act like a nation of sheep if you act

656
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:20,440
like a nation cowering the government even if there's good people in government

657
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:25,280
they will be replaced by people looking to dominate sheep and that process has

658
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:28,960
been going on that's why great nations that had a lot of freedom it takes a

659
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:33,120
long time for them to get rid of the old culture of freedom the old culture of

660
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:38,120
being honorable and again if I could give a brain transplant or like a Vulcan

661
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:42,480
mind-meld with all Americans or all people in the world and just let them

662
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:48,960
see what I've seen like the new Star Trek movie that came

663
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:54,320
out if I could just say here here's what I just saw and have you see all the

664
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:57,560
quotes and all the things and them grab in my arm and hey what's going on we're

665
00:55:57,560 --> 00:56:00,600
gonna kill you and we take over you know that the first time it happens you're

666
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:03,960
like man who are you I'm with them and we're taking over soon and I'll be our

667
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:08,720
time it's always some weird little wimp who would never face you except they've

668
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:13,680
got the cops there from the special unit not the general cops with the special

669
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:18,240
event unit ready to set you up their power is because they're a gang of

670
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:22,680
bullies lined up and then you go to the next event they come over and tell you

671
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:25,840
they're gonna kill you and I've even caught it on tape where the communists

672
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:32,640
are in New York and they say we're gonna kill you it's in my film martial law and

673
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:35,880
I'm like you're gonna kill me they're like yeah we're gonna we're gonna kill

674
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:40,720
all of you when we take over we're gonna kill you

675
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:44,280
and see it's not just folks when this is probably I don't want to exaggerate

676
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:48,800
probably 15 times I've had him tell me in person they're gonna kill me and then

677
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:52,880
and then now they get on the news and say they're going to kill me I hope his

678
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:57,840
kids don't get killed hope he didn't get that call some night and piers they cut

679
00:56:57,840 --> 00:57:03,280
to piers and he goes yes and I'm like oh that body language didn't look good I

680
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:06,840
watch like that's really creepy that's a threat and I'm like I'm not sure but it

681
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:09,840
looked like it my kids who normally don't scare easier like they're gonna

682
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:16,520
kill us I'm like no no no no and then five minutes later yeah we ought to kill

683
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:22,000
Alex yeah we'll dress up in uniforms and do it people like oh it's just a joke

684
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,480

685
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:33,360

the journey is the destination for them that's like linen they in many towns

691
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:03,640
they killed 50% the NKVD documents were declassified a few decades ago they'd

692
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:07,440
say sir we've killed about half the population shit the other quarter to

693
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:12,000
gulag slave labor thousand miles away there's only a small percentage of

694
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:16,920
people left now and we need them to basically supply us with food and then

695
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:21,240
be our servants he'd say no kill them and they'd say why sir and he would he

696
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:25,080
wrote orders more blood and they would say and he'd say and if you won't do it

697
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:29,480
I'm gonna kill you and then he would go into these things on the ground flopping

trip to the high mountains high mountain desert of southwest Texas just never had

01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:57,040
today popping in for one segment I just had to

718
01:00:57,040 --> 01:01:04,200
have him on he heads up the US Small Business Association Obama proposes to

719
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:08,080
close the Small Business Administration as predicted so they already illegally

720
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:12,320
don't do everything they can to not give government contracts to small businesses

721
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:15,920
and have a secret blacklist that he sued and exposed now they're just getting rid

722
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:19,120
of it period because they don't want anybody getting together and

723
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:24,160
communicating the giant screw job that's happening and here's an example not a

724
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:28,600
small business but big heavy industrial twenty two billion dollars was paid to

725
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:33,600
your taxpayer money to ship General Motors to South America China and Eastern

726
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:36,920
Europe and again it's not gonna help the Chinese and Eastern Europeans or the

727
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:40,080
Brazilians I'm not against them getting jobs because they ship it there to

728
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:43,800
actually lower the wages there and drag ours down it's a globalist plan it's

729
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:48,560
cold-blooded it's economic domination and see that's why they all push oh like

730
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:52,680
in World War Z the book how the great South African plan was that you know

731
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:55,740
just let the general public be killed and how cold-blooded and beautiful it

732
01:01:55,740 --> 01:01:59,800
was and how not being human is so great and how being cold-blooded let me tell

733
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:02,280
you these globalists want you to be cold-blooded they actually are

734
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:07,000
hot-blooded and enjoy hurting people and they actually care about their kids

735
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:12,000
listen I'm not gonna lay over and die so a bunch of hunchback buck-toothed bug

736
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:16,560
eyed inbred New World Order trash can have their way okay you people are

737
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:23,560
cancer and I declare info war on you and set my full will and my name and my life

738
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:30,080
and my soul on the altar of God and God recognizes that God gave us all power

739
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:35,080
we're just not using our power against the New World Order and greater he that

740
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:41,240
is in me than he that is in the world and in the only reason we had all this

741
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:45,600
liberty and all this wealth was because we were evil compared to other countries

742
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:53,320
we were more god-fearing America was the best the West is the best what developed

743
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:57,800
here what happened is the greatest expression of human liberty with all its

744
01:02:57,800 --> 01:03:01,880
warts and all its pot marks and all its problems and that's why the New World

745
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:06,080
Order seeks to expunge that and they send their horsemen their minions like

746
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:10,280
this piers morgan with his minions talking about shooting me here it is but

747
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:15,120
what do you need a semi-automatic weapon for the only reason I think you need it

748
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:18,920
is Pierce challenge Alex Jones to a boxing match show up with a

749
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:31,760
semi-automatic that you got legally and pop them I'd love to see that now a new

750
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:37,280
clip surfaced of him in England I guess while he was back visiting for two weeks

751
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:45,160
before all this happened and there he is sniveling about how line up the gun

752
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:49,440
owners and just machine gun us with a government gun you notice government gun

753
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:53,280
good citizen gun bad here it is theoretical situation you've got

754
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:57,800
Clarkson Trini and in his like all on Britain's got talent they all do the

755
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:00,360
respective kind of things that they're supposed to be famous for you know

756
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:04,040
lots of us ranting about green credentials there's lots of sake jokes

757
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:07,440
Trini talking about what you guys are wearing how do you mark them how would

758
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:11,140
you scale them and what would I do is I've replaced the buzzers with a machine

759
01:04:11,140 --> 01:04:15,040
gun and just take them all out and do the public a massive favor what I'd do

760
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:18,440
is I've replaced the buzzers with a machine gun and just take them all out

761
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:21,800
and do the public a massive favor

762
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:29,240
always fantasizing about shooting people and since then I've saw some other

763
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:33,320
videos I forgot to give you guys where he's talking about shooting people and

764
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:36,880
by the way I've been around these guys they think you can't even touch a gun

765
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:43,120
unless you're in a uniform they see a guy they go but then they see government

766
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:46,600
and black Darth Vader outfit that's what you should get concerned about not

767
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:50,440
scared of the guy the fact that he's trying to scare you you know when

768
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:54,160
government starts dressing in black Darth Vader outfits you're not in a free

769
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:59,920
country or you're going the direction of tyranny we'll be back stay with us

770

sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and

836
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:45,360
folks here is this amazing special report the Second Amendment to the

837
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:50,240
Constitution a well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a

838
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:54,160
free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be

839
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:59,200
infringed shall not be infringed shall not be infringed shall not be infringed

840
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:04,880
shall not be infringed the founding fathers agree armed citizens make good

841
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:10,880
government I asked her what is the militia it is the whole people who is

842
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:16,000
the militia are they not ourselves to disarm the people that is the best and

843
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:20,800
most effective way to enslave them George Mason Congress have no power to

844
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:26,080
disarm the militia their swords and every other terrible implement of the

845
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:32,280
soldier are the birthright of an American tench Cox 1788 the

846
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:36,920
Constitution preserves the advantage of being armed which Americans possess over

847
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:40,920
the people of almost every other nation where the governments are afraid to

848
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:46,200
trust the people with arms James Madison a federalist number 46 a free people

849
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:49,120
ought not only to be armed and disciplined but they should have

850
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:53,480
sufficient arms and ammunition to maintain a status of independence from

851
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:57,240
any who might attempt to abuse them which would include their own government

852
01:11:57,240 --> 01:12:02,200
George Washington the founding fathers created the Bill of Rights enshrined

853
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:06,200
individual protections including the Second Amendment because they

854
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:10,840
understood that power inherently corrupts the Bill of Rights was set up

855
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:15,400
to try to discourage bad behavior from government try to further restrain it

856
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:20,120
and try to head off what they knew would eventually become misinterpretations of

857
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:24,800
the law and attempts to misconstrue the intent of the founders but their quotes

858
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:29,160
here cannot be more clear if the representatives of the people betray

859
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:34,320
their constituents there is then no recourse left but in the exertion of

860
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:39,520
that original right of self-defense which is paramount to all positive forms

861
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:44,440
of government Alexander Hamilton the Federalist number 28 are we at last

862
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:48,640
brought to such a humiliating and debasing degradation that we cannot be

863
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:53,640
trusted with arms for our own defense Patrick Henry the Constitution shall

864
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:57,920
never be construed to authorize Congress to prevent the people of the United

865
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:03,200
States who are peaceable citizens from keeping their own arms Samuel Adams the

866
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:07,560
right of citizens to bear arms is just one more guarantee against arbitrary

867
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:11,920
government one more safeguard against the tyranny which now appears remote in

868
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:15,760
America but which historically has proved to be always possible

869
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:22,240
Hubert Humphrey 1960 when governments fear the people there is Liberty when

870
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:26,200
the people fear the government there is tyranny the strongest reason for the

871
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:31,760
people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is as a last resort to protect

872
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:37,520
themselves against tyranny in government Thomas Jefferson the best we can hope

873
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:42,760
for concerning the people at large is that they be properly armed Alexander

874
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:46,760
Hamilton the very atmosphere of firearms anywhere and everywhere

875
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:51,960
restrains evil interference they deserve a place of honor with all that is good

876
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:56,720
George Washington arms discourage and keep the invader and plunderer in awe

877
01:13:56,720 --> 01:14:01,040
and preserve order in the world as well as property forad mischief would ensue

878
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:05,640
were the law-abiding deprived of the use of them Thomas Paine to preserve Liberty

879
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:11,520
it is essential that the whole body of the people always possess arms and be

880
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:18,480
taught alike especially when young how to use them Richard Henry Lee 1778 a

881
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:22,760
free people claim their rights as derived from the laws of nature and not

882
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:27,760
as a gift of their chief magistrate Thomas Jefferson our Second Amendment

883
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:31,560
our free speech our gifts from God but the fact that they were pointed out

884
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:35,840
highlighted enumerated and strengthened in the Bill of Rights and Constitution

885
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:40,160
is our birthright you don't have to like guns you don't have to like the Second

886
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:44,360
Amendment to fight for it to stand up for it if we let it slip away we're

887
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:49,000
going to lose everything from free speech on down that light will be dimmed

888
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:52,920
if we allow them to encroach on the Second Amendment guard with jealous

889
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:57,200
attention the public liberty suspect everyone who approaches that jewel

890
01:14:57,200 --> 01:15:01,720
unfortunately nothing will preserve it but downright force wherever you give up

891
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:05,800
that force you are ruined the great object is that every man be armed

892
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:12,920
everyone who is able might have a gun Patrick Henry dictators and disarmed

893
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:18,180
populations go together the most foolish mistake we can possibly make would be to

894
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:23,400
allow the subject races to possess arms history shows that all conquerors who

895
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:27,680
have allowed their subject races to carry arms have prepared their own

896
01:15:27,680 --> 01:15:34,280
downfall by doing so Adolf Hitler April 1942 before standing army can rule the

897
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:39,320
people must be disarmed as they are in almost every kingdom in Europe Noah

898
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:46,520
Webster death solves all problems no man no problem Joseph Stalin in earlier

899
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:52,360
times it was easier to control 1 million people than to physically kill 1 million

900
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:59,000
people today it is infinitely easier to kill 1 million people than to control 1

901
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:04,960
million people Zignu Brzezinski if the opposition disarms well and good if it

902
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:10,340
refuses to disarm we shall disarm it ourselves Joseph Stalin one death is a

903
01:16:10,340 --> 01:16:16,680
tragedy 1 million is a statistic Joseph Stalin to disarm the people is the best

904
01:16:16,680 --> 01:16:21,960
and most effective way to enslave them George Mason and tyranny always follows

905
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:26,120
disarm populations it's the history of democide it's what naturally happens

906
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:31,320
when power is too concentrated in one man in one centralized government in one

907
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:35,480
tyrannical system as we now see worldwide we were supposed to set up

908
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:40,040
checks and balances in an attempt to create better government instead we let

909
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:44,200
our guard down and the corporations have taken over it is the duty of the Patriot

910
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:48,560
to protect his country from its government Thomas Paine the supreme

911
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:53,320
power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword because the whole body

912
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:58,800
of the people are armed you know Webster 1787 ideas are more powerful than guns

913
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:03,760
we would not let our enemies have guns why should we let them have ideas Joseph

914
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:08,200
Stalin those now possessing weapons and ammunition are at once to turn them over

915

to the local police authority firearms and ammunition found in a Jews

916
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:16,680
possession will be forfeited to the government without compensation whoever

917
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:21,040
willfully or negligently violates the provisions will be punished with

918

imprisonment and a fine Nazi law regulations against Jews possession of

Zedong the only real power comes out of a long rifle Joseph Stalin those who

921
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:40,840
beat their swords into plowshares usually end up plowing for those who

922
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:45,560
didn't Ben Franklin if gun laws in fact worked the sponsors of this type of

923
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:49,840
legislation should have no difficulty drawing upon long lists of examples of

924
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:54,880
crime rates reduced by such legislation that they cannot do so after a century

925
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:59,560
and a half of trying but they must sweep under the rug the southern attempts at

926
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:04,520
gun control in the 1870 to 1910 period the northeastern attempts in the 1920 to

927
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:11,320
1939 period the attempts at both federal and state levels in 1965 through 1976

928
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:16,240
establishes the repeated complete and inevitable failure of gun laws to

929
01:18:16,240 --> 01:18:21,000
control serious crime or in hatch and the right to keep and bear arms after a

930
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:24,960
shooting spree they always want to take guns away from the people who didn't do

931
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:29,160
it I sure as hell wouldn't want to live in a society where the only people

932
01:18:29,160 --> 01:18:33,600
allowed guns are the police and military William S burrows they've undermined our

933
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:37,160
economic system they've instituted the Federal Reserve they bought out

934
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:41,440
politicians and now they're coming for the final restraint on their total power

935
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:46,000
that is firearms that is guns that is the Second Amendment and if you let them

936
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:50,200
do it they're going to encroach on our entire lives if you want the right to

937
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:54,520
control your own life to pursue life liberty and the pursuit of happiness you

938
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:59,040
must politically stand up for the Second Amendment and say no to these attempts

939
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:03,560

Mickelson warns of drastic changes because of state of federal tax

1016
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:18,280
situation we've got Americans fleeing Hawaii fleeing California fleeing New

1017
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:26,240
York fleeing other high tax zones to places like Texas so that is coming up

1018
01:25:26,240 --> 01:25:31,480
right now let's go to a clip from Obama's coronation yesterday on the

1019
01:25:31,480 --> 01:25:37,360
Second Amendment and more through it all we have never relinquished our

1020
01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:43,160
skepticism of central authority nor have we succumbed to the fiction that all

1021
01:25:43,160 --> 01:25:49,960
society's ills can be cured through government alone our celebration of

1022
01:25:49,960 --> 01:25:55,800
initiative and enterprise our insistence on hard work and personal responsibility

1023
01:25:55,800 --> 01:26:03,320
these are constants in our character we have always understood that when times

1024
01:26:03,320 --> 01:26:10,240
change so must we that fidelity to our founding principles requires new

1025
01:26:10,240 --> 01:26:16,200
responses to new challenges the preserving our individual freedoms

1026
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:22,800
ultimately requires collective action for the American people can no more meet

1027
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:26,760
the demands of today's world by acting alone than American soldiers could have

1028
01:26:26,760 --> 01:26:30,880
met the forces of fascism or communism with muskets and militia that's global

1029
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:35,960
government no single person can train all the math and science teachers will

1030
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:40,760
need to equip our children pause back it up back in about 20 seconds I want to

1031
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:45,920
hear that musket part again they cut to the military shots of the military and

1032
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:51,080
then they say militias and muskets the message is you can't protect us really

1033
01:26:51,080 --> 01:26:54,840
the muskets in the militia are to protect us from you the founders are

1034
01:26:54,840 --> 01:26:59,400
clear I just played clips that are on record of what they said and they try to

1035
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:03,160
take the guns over and over again and now they've set up a paradigm where if

1036
01:27:03,160 --> 01:27:08,360
you don't give your guns up you're causing more children to die when the

1037
01:27:08,360 --> 01:27:12,720
government has made it gun free zones advertise it's a new thing to do go kill

1038
01:27:12,720 --> 01:27:18,640
kids and put people on drugs that on record gives them a compulsion to go out

1039
01:27:18,640 --> 01:27:22,720
and engage in mass murder while they advertise oh you're being given pills

1040
01:27:22,720 --> 01:27:26,960
that make you psychotic now we're going to push this let's go to this clip meet

1041
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:30,920
the demands of today's world by acting alone than American soldiers could have

1042
01:27:30,920 --> 01:27:37,600
met the forces of fascism or communism with muskets and militias no single

1043
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:41,000
person can train all the math and science teachers will need to equip our

1044
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:46,040
children that's enough of it or build the roads and networks and research labs

1045
01:27:46,040 --> 01:27:49,400
that will bring new jobs and businesses to our shores it's more you didn't build

1046
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:57,520
it garbage now more than ever we must do these things together as one nation

1047
01:27:57,520 --> 01:28:05,480
total communism that's enough now again if he came out and said we need to

1048
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:09,400
collectively get behind the Bill of Rights and Constitution to empower

1049
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:14,320
individualism you see because there is a collective of liberty but where the

1050
01:28:14,320 --> 01:28:18,240
individual is strong and makes the whole greater that's not their system the

1051
01:28:18,240 --> 01:28:22,360
collective is strong the individual needs to be weak it's the devil's

1052
01:28:22,360 --> 01:28:27,120
counterfeit and then meanwhile here's the key to all this we're going to come

1053
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:31,280
back and break this down they're saying we know things are tough come together

1054
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:34,760
and we'll get out of this and that's what they have the clergy response team

1055
01:28:34,760 --> 01:28:40,720
manuals say and we've seen clergy on TV talk about where they're told they're in

1056
01:28:40,720 --> 01:28:43,800
the crisis take the shot go to the FEMA camp do what you're told we'll get out

1057
01:28:43,800 --> 01:28:48,400
of this do what you're told we'll get you out of this collapsed mine do what

1058
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:51,960
you're told the economy will come back turn your guns in things will get better

1059
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:56,920
give us a third bailout grease and we'll turn the lights back on things only got

1060
01:28:56,920 --> 01:29:02,500
worse it's false hope it is a program where they implode things offer the

1061
01:29:02,500 --> 01:29:06,680
solution that's more government things implode more offer the solution more

1062
01:29:06,680 --> 01:29:11,120
government things implode more offer the solution more government things implode

1063
01:29:11,120 --> 01:29:16,360
more offer the solution more government and then they are exempt from the laws

1064
01:29:16,360 --> 01:29:20,800
and regulations and taxes so what happens they set up a system where you

1065
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:27,400
can't operate and only they can it's called monopoly tyranny very cold blood

1066
01:29:27,400 --> 01:29:30,920
and they all write white papers and talk about it in agenda 21 and how they're

1067
01:29:30,920 --> 01:29:34,800
gonna shut everything off while going things are getting bad it's come

1068
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:39,920
together behind me I'll fix them you see how cold-blooded that is while

1069
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:45,400
they do everything they can to make it impossible to live or be have a farm or

1070

1166
01:38:29,400 --> 01:38:38,440
140 a.m. and FM affiliates as of right now okay again it's hard for me to

1167
01:38:38,440 --> 01:38:42,560
get into a subject like this because I want to hit you with a thousand data

1168
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:50,040
points but our guest is holding waiting to cover the latest incredible outrage

1169
01:38:50,040 --> 01:38:58,880
that the system is pushing but Obama is looking to get rid of the u.s. small

1170
01:38:58,880 --> 01:39:04,360
business administration and consolidated basically in under Homeland Security

1171
01:39:04,360 --> 01:39:09,360
just the overall Gestapo and he's selling it like hey you want to get rid

1172
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:14,000
of federal agencies I will get rid of it now here's the issue you're supposed to

1173
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:18,640
have him and our guests will give you all the numbers the majority of money

1174
01:39:18,640 --> 01:39:22,960
taxpayer money when it is federal dollars is supposed to go back to small

1175
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:28,960
and local businesses so that at least the argument is if 30 40 percent of our

1176
01:39:28,960 --> 01:39:34,800
money is going to the feds it'll come back but that there's got to be a bid

1177
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:40,160
competition to ensure that we don't get ripped off and then that way if we're

1178
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:43,400
going to have a big government system at least our own tax money comes flowing

1179
01:39:43,400 --> 01:39:48,560
back to then build up of the economy now the problem with that always is big

1180
01:39:48,560 --> 01:39:52,200
government is going to end up having special interests mainly globalists come

1181
01:39:52,200 --> 01:39:55,480
in and pay them off and it's come out in the last few years he's filed dozens of

1182
01:39:55,480 --> 01:39:58,440
lawsuits dozens and dozens on the subject we'll get the actual numbers I

1183
01:39:58,440 --> 01:40:06,840
know it's a lot from him from our guest to to not let small businesses get any

1184
01:40:06,840 --> 01:40:10,720
of the money in fact most of them it turns out are foreigners and when the

1185
01:40:10,720 --> 01:40:14,000
public wakes up to this they go hey you're right there shouldn't be no bid

1186
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:18,840
contracts for French companies no no this is even American companies that

1187
01:40:18,840 --> 01:40:24,760
aren't even allowed to bid in the case of what we saw in Iraq is is that they

1188
01:40:24,760 --> 01:40:31,320
spun it as oh yeah you know it's no bid contracts for national security but

1189
01:40:31,320 --> 01:40:36,400
turned out it was foreign companies the point is there's just so many angles to

1190
01:40:36,400 --> 01:40:40,840
all of this it makes my head spin and you've seen some of the most famous

1191
01:40:40,840 --> 01:40:47,080
actors and soccer players in France leaving because they have a 75% income

1192
01:40:47,080 --> 01:40:53,360
tax and then on top of that any money that you get to keep over a million

1193
01:40:53,360 --> 01:41:00,160
euros another 75% tax in fact some people pay over 80% but 75 is what most

1194
01:41:00,160 --> 01:41:05,160
of the high-income earners pay so what's 75 and then 75 on top of that you have

1195
01:41:05,160 --> 01:41:09,400
25% left and you take 75 from that not counting all the local taxes I'm you're

1196
01:41:09,400 --> 01:41:14,240
talking about not even 10% of your money you keep and and by the way Obama has

1197
01:41:14,240 --> 01:41:18,560
hired the big French top economists to help run international and domestic

1198
01:41:18,560 --> 01:41:23,320
systems that was in the news two weeks ago and they're calling her this genius

1199
01:41:23,320 --> 01:41:27,840
oh it's so genius to have everybody basically working for the government and

1200
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:31,960
then that gives them total control over society well here's a new article out of

1201
01:41:31,960 --> 01:41:39,640
Yahoo Sports Phil Mickelson warns of drastic changes because of state federal

1202
01:41:39,640 --> 01:41:44,480
tax situation if you add up all the federal and you look at the disability

1203
01:41:44,480 --> 01:41:49,000
and the unemployment the Social Security and the state my tax rate is 62 63

1204
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:53,440
percent he said so I've got to make some decisions on what I'm going to do there

1205
01:41:53,440 --> 01:41:57,840
are going to be some drastic changes for me because I happen to be in the zone

1206
01:41:57,840 --> 01:42:01,280
that has been targeted both federally and by the state and you know it doesn't

1207
01:42:01,280 --> 01:42:04,720
work for me now he added so I'm going to have to make some changes and is saying

1208
01:42:04,720 --> 01:42:08,760
he may leave and take his business out of California the great exodus so the

1209
01:42:08,760 --> 01:42:16,160
globalists say that they need a global government show that you can't escape

1210
01:42:16,160 --> 01:42:20,520
them but then they at the global level they're exempt just like EU bureaucrats

1211
01:42:20,520 --> 01:42:27,040
are totally exempt from federal EU taxes but they have the head of the EU

1212
01:42:27,040 --> 01:42:31,920
bureaucrats the head of the IMF what's the La Grande Lagarde I always

1213
01:42:31,920 --> 01:42:35,320
mispronounce it she comes out member and says the Greeks aren't paying enough

1214
01:42:35,320 --> 01:42:41,080
taxes on average over 60% and then Howard Dean comes out and says poor

1215
01:42:41,080 --> 01:42:43,440
people need to pay more well guess what they are now

1216
01:42:43,440 --> 01:42:47,200
payroll taxes kicked in how you like that 3.8% on top of the 10% you were

1217
01:42:47,200 --> 01:42:52,320
paying that's almost 14% right there okay that's enough I'm gonna go to our

1218
01:42:52,320 --> 01:43:00,120
guest here and he joins us and guys I had the article here it is press release

1219
01:43:00,120 --> 01:43:04,160
Obama proposes to close the Small Business Administration as predicted

1220
01:43:04,160 --> 01:43:10,400
October 31st 2012 that's when that first came out well now he's back with it that

1221
01:43:10,400 --> 01:43:13,600
he's been sworn in so they've been predicting it since then and now

1222
01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:17,840
they're moving ahead with it Lloyd Chapman a frequent guest I don't have

1223
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:21,840
more time for him here today and I appreciate him joining us ASBL.com he

1224
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:27,280
joins us he's a private group who's been successfully lobbying for millions of

1225
01:43:27,280 --> 01:43:30,960
small businesses and he's the biggest small business organization outside of

1226
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:34,840
the Better Business Bureau and a few others in the Chamber of Commerce and

1227
01:43:34,840 --> 01:43:39,320
he's been exposing how they do everything they can to make sure small

1228
01:43:39,320 --> 01:43:43,080
businesses cannot get one dollar and it's and it's illegal what's happening

1229
01:43:43,080 --> 01:43:48,200
so now Obama wants no oversight and no group period to even dispense it okay so

1230
01:43:48,200 --> 01:43:52,400
Lloyd Chapman born and raised in Texas he began his career working of course

1231
01:43:52,400 --> 01:43:56,740
for Bob Bullock famous Democrat spent eight years the Texas Comptroller's

1232
01:43:56,740 --> 01:43:59,640
Office before moving to California to enter the computer industry and I'm not

1233
01:43:59,640 --> 01:44:03,520
going to go through how he launched successful technology firms and things

1234
01:44:03,520 --> 01:44:07,800
like that and how he was involved in congressional intervention and

1235
01:44:07,800 --> 01:44:11,120
investigations of f-22 stealth fighters and things like that he's gotten a lot

1236
01:44:11,120 --> 01:44:18,060
done how many lawsuits have you filed total oh probably about 40 40 so I said

1237
01:44:18,060 --> 01:44:22,080
dozens and dozens that was accurate okay I burn most the time here we got two

1238
01:44:22,080 --> 01:44:26,280
segments left run through what we're facing and what this means all right

1239
01:44:26,280 --> 01:44:30,140
well I like to I like to talk about the facts I'm trying to be persuasive so

1240
01:44:30,140 --> 01:44:34,480
according to the US Census Bureau small business in America responsible for over

1241
01:44:34,480 --> 01:44:39,800
90% of the net new jobs half the gross domestic product half the private sector

1242
01:44:39,800 --> 01:44:44,240
workforce and over 90% of all u.s. exporters so if you want to create jobs

1243
01:44:44,240 --> 01:44:48,080
you've got to do it through small businesses the Coppin Foundation at a

1244
01:44:48,080 --> 01:44:53,800
study a couple years ago that said small businesses have created 100% of the net

1245
01:44:53,800 --> 01:44:58,560
new job since 1980 that means fortune 1000 firms haven't created one net new

1246
01:44:58,560 --> 01:45:02,840
job in over 30 years so small businesses of a heart and soul of our nation's

1247
01:45:02,840 --> 01:45:07,240
economy there's one agency in Washington to help the small businesses that's the

1248
01:45:07,240 --> 01:45:11,200
Small Business Administration it's actually fairly small agency there's 28

1249
01:45:11,200 --> 01:45:15,400
million small businesses and Barack Obama is gonna try to close it which

1250
01:45:15,400 --> 01:45:21,720
would be economic suicide and I'm trying to stop him and I don't know why he

1251
01:45:21,720 --> 01:45:24,920
wants to close it I I guess the only reason he wants to close it is to cover

1252
01:45:24,920 --> 01:45:28,320
up the fraud and abuse that's going on during his administration I know if you

1253
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:32,480
saw the story but the New York Times in a story of a couple of months ago if the

1254
01:45:32,480 --> 01:45:39,040
Obama ministration gave 900 over 900 million in US government small business

1255
01:45:39,040 --> 01:45:42,760
contracts to a Russian-owned international arms dealer called rose

1256
01:45:42,760 --> 01:45:48,800
born exports that's the type of thing that Barack Obama's doing and there's

1257
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:52,120
been a number of federal investigation yes we did see that that was huge news

1258
01:45:52,120 --> 01:45:57,200
and that's only the tip of the iceberg absolutely the Inspector General for the

1259
01:45:57,200 --> 01:46:01,360
Small Business Administration that he appointed has stated every year of his

1260
01:46:01,360 --> 01:46:05,160
administration the number one challenge at the Small Business Administration is

1261
01:46:05,160 --> 01:46:09,640
the diversion of federal small business contracts to large corporations and

1262
01:46:09,640 --> 01:46:15,080
they've named it one of the largest challenges facing the entire country so

1263
01:46:15,080 --> 01:46:18,700
I think Obama's gonna try to close the SBA by combining it with probably the

1264
01:46:18,700 --> 01:46:22,440
Commerce Department and it's just an attempt on his part to cover up the

1265
01:46:22,440 --> 01:46:26,000
rampant fraud abuse and it's going to be devastating to our economy if he's

1266
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:30,440
successful and I hope people will join us in fighting the Obama administration

1267
01:46:30,440 --> 01:46:37,440
to save the only agency to help the middle class and as usual mr. Chapman

1268
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:42,600
there's all this spin that is involved at so many levels to this where Obama's

1269
01:46:42,600 --> 01:46:47,600
selling it like I'm gonna get rid of waste I'm gonna get rid of a bad agency

1270
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:51,760
and I'm gonna cut government but really this is the agency that makes sure

1271
01:46:51,760 --> 01:46:57,880
federal funds actually go to real US companies and ie small ones absolutely

1272
01:46:57,880 --> 01:47:01,920
federal law says a minimum of twenty three percent of the total value of all

1273
01:47:01,920 --> 01:47:04,920
federal contract should go to small businesses I don't think there's a

1274
01:47:04,920 --> 01:47:09,480
better way to invest our tax dollars in then to reinvest back into the companies

1275
01:47:09,480 --> 01:47:13,200
that create all the jobs companies were most Americans work and he wants to get

1276
01:47:13,200 --> 01:47:17,000
rid of that he says he's gonna save three hundred million dollars a year in

1277
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:22,840
the federal budget that's that's peanuts the Pentagon misplaces hundreds of

1278
01:47:22,840 --> 01:47:27,160
billions to put it into perspective he says he's gonna close the SBA to save

1279
01:47:27,160 --> 01:47:31,680
three hundred million a year it is gonna increase foreign aid by nine billion a

1280
01:47:31,680 --> 01:47:35,080
year that would be enough to do two things put an armed guard at every

1281
01:47:35,080 --> 01:47:40,600
school in America are run the SBA for a decade so his story about closing the

1282
01:47:40,600 --> 01:47:45,240
SBA to say three million a year is just ridiculous it's not believable and again

1283
01:47:45,240 --> 01:47:51,680
Lloyd Chapman joins us he is the head of the ASBL American Small Business League

1284
01:47:51,680 --> 01:47:54,960
really the only group out there kind of like Gunners of America that's that's

1285
01:47:54,960 --> 01:47:59,440
that's medium-sized and really fighting hard you know you're a nice guy and you

1286
01:47:59,440 --> 01:48:03,240
you're not a psychopath you're not a sociopath you're not a control freak so

1287
01:48:03,240 --> 01:48:06,640
you go I don't know why he's doing this well you know I mean you've helped break

1288
01:48:06,640 --> 01:48:11,200
it in the national news a few years ago where they create secret black lists for

1289
01:48:11,200 --> 01:48:14,520
small businesses where they're taking the majority the money and giving it not

1290
01:48:14,520 --> 01:48:19,520
just a mega corporations but foreign corporations he paid 22 billion of the

1291
01:48:19,520 --> 01:48:24,120
bailout money to General Motors to ship it to China vault Cadillac and and other

1292
01:48:24,120 --> 01:48:27,840
factories some others went to Brazil others Eastern Europe they're doing

1293
01:48:27,840 --> 01:48:31,920
everything they can we went from 25 million on food stamps to 49 million his

1294
01:48:31,920 --> 01:48:35,360
first four years they want us dependent they're globalists it's agenda 21

1295
01:48:35,360 --> 01:48:39,080
California knows when they raise taxes it's gonna kill the state I mean they

1296
01:48:39,080 --> 01:48:43,080
know what they're doing they want us bankrupt it's cold-blooded they want to

1297
01:48:43,080 --> 01:48:47,440
destroy this country they want to break us to bring us into collectivism they're

1298
01:48:47,440 --> 01:48:50,600
doing this period in fact what's the percentage I saw in the Wall Street

1299
01:48:50,600 --> 01:48:54,500
Journal in a report talking about you like a year ago how much of the small

1300
01:48:54,500 --> 01:49:01,440
business contracts actually goes to multinationals oh probably maybe half

1301
01:49:01,440 --> 01:49:05,600
and then total goes to big companies that's supposed to be going to small

1302
01:49:05,600 --> 01:49:10,200
ones right I mean I mean obviously if you're gonna have you know trillions of

1303
01:49:10,200 --> 01:49:13,840
dollars the federal government it better come back into America at least that

1304
01:49:13,840 --> 01:49:18,440
creates some jobs it gives them still control but I mean they're killing their

1305
01:49:18,440 --> 01:49:23,200
own golden goose here absolutely the Small Business Act is the most efficient

1306
01:49:23,200 --> 01:49:27,480
effective economic stimulus program in the history of America if Barack Obama

1307
01:49:27,480 --> 01:49:31,480
would simply quit giving federal small business contracts to fortune 500 firms

1308
01:49:31,480 --> 01:49:36,400
that not only are not creating jobs but shipping jobs overseas it would create

1309
01:49:36,400 --> 01:49:40,160
more jobs do more to boost the economy anything here President Bush ever spoke

1310
01:49:40,160 --> 01:49:44,720
of it's so simple he could do one executive order would take him five

1311
01:49:44,720 --> 01:49:47,680
minutes and just says a federal government would no longer report awards

1312
01:49:47,680 --> 01:49:50,080
to publicly traded companies or foreign-owned companies as small

1313
01:49:50,080 --> 01:49:56,320
business awards it would put as much as 200 billion a year an existing federal

1314
01:49:56,320 --> 01:50:00,240
infrastructure spinning back into the middle class but he's not going to do

1315
01:50:00,240 --> 01:50:07,840
that and he's going to destroy our economy there there's no logic behind

1316
01:50:07,840 --> 01:50:12,640
taking federal funds about largely going to the the middle class where most

1317
01:50:12,640 --> 01:50:16,160
people work and all the jobs are created and giving it to foreign-owned companies

1318
01:50:16,160 --> 01:50:20,880
that there's there's no way to justify totally illegal I mean again I kind of

1319
01:50:20,880 --> 01:50:24,280
bumbled it earlier we're going to break gonna come back and continue along this

1320
01:50:24,280 --> 01:50:28,320
but you know the point is the the no bid contracts came out in Iraq hundreds of

1321
01:50:28,320 --> 01:50:31,680
billions of dollars something was over a trillion total trillion seven like the

1322
01:50:31,680 --> 01:50:37,160
whole thing and still going but they're sitting there saying oh you know be

1323
01:50:37,160 --> 01:50:40,680
quiet we've got to have no bids for national security for American companies

1324
01:50:40,680 --> 01:50:45,040
it was foreign companies getting in a no bid I mean it's even worse but to the

1325
01:50:45,040 --> 01:50:48,400
general public oh we got to do it for national security for American companies

1326
01:50:48,400 --> 01:50:52,440
it's foreign companies I mean ladies and gentlemen the foreign companies come in

1327
01:50:52,440 --> 01:50:57,000
and lobby to take your tax money out of the country this is how we've been

1328
01:50:57,000 --> 01:51:02,320
occupied and conquered this is economic espionage if you've ever wanted one of

1329
01:51:02,320 --> 01:51:06,280
our best-selling generators but we're waiting for an offer so crazy you

1330
01:51:06,280 --> 01:51:09,400
couldn't refuse then you're not going to want to miss this exciting message

1331
01:51:09,400 --> 01:51:14,400
here's why our solar generators provide life-saving electrical power and unlike

1332
01:51:14,400 --> 01:51:18,840
gas generators solar generators run quietly emit no fumes and produce

1333
01:51:18,840 --> 01:51:22,960
electricity from the Sun so when the lights go out you'll always have the

1334
01:51:22,960 --> 01:51:27,600
power you need now here's the best part every year we accumulate a few solar

1335
01:51:27,600 --> 01:51:32,480
generators that we just can't sell as new we put them in a special spot in our

1336
01:51:32,480 --> 01:51:36,760
warehouse and we discount them heavily at the end of each year we call them

1337
01:51:36,760 --> 01:51:40,960
scratch and dead units but they're really just like new each unit comes

1338
01:51:40,960 --> 01:51:45,480
with a full factory warranty and special bonuses you just won't believe don't

1339
01:51:45,480 --> 01:51:49,800
wait they go fast go to scratch and then solar calm that scratch and then solar

1340
01:51:49,800 --> 01:51:55,440
calm for the craziest offer we've ever made go to scratch and then solar calm

1341
01:51:55,440 --> 01:51:59,680
that scratch and then solar calm

1342
01:52:01,280 --> 01:52:06,440
hey there Frank Bates here have you heard about the weird device that could

1343
01:52:06,440 --> 01:52:12,440
wipe out 280 million Americans this is really scary stuff defense experts warn

1344
01:52:12,440 --> 01:52:17,600
that this odd device poses the greatest threat we've ever known in fact just a

1345
01:52:17,600 --> 01:52:20,880
few weeks ago former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich wrote an op-ed

1346
01:52:20,880 --> 01:52:25,080
piece for the Washington Post warning about this deadly threat I can't believe

1347
01:52:25,080 --> 01:52:28,880
that more people aren't talking about this it may be because the liberals and

1348
01:52:28,880 --> 01:52:33,000
the government are trying to cover it up that's why my friend just created a free

1349
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:38,600

We got our guest a little bit into the next hour the Max Kaiser is joining us

1370
01:54:19,280 --> 01:54:24,680
on the economic front and a lot more

1371

attendees at Obama inauguration and and they searched them they groped their

1373

genitals and they did the the full frisk because you're a criminal government is

1374
01:54:39,760 --> 01:54:45,320
God you are bad and then you see people like Saddam Hussein and others they can

1375
01:54:45,320 --> 01:54:49,060
stand around with everybody thousands of people firing machine guns in the air no

1376
01:54:49,060 --> 01:54:53,800
one shoots them but but our supposed free leaders and again the globalists

1377
01:54:53,800 --> 01:54:57,280
selected who could run they put the billions of dollars in to put who they

1378
01:54:57,280 --> 01:55:01,780
wanted in both guys basically wanted the same thing one just paid lip service to

1379
01:55:01,780 --> 01:55:05,960
you did build that the other didn't

1380
01:55:05,960 --> 01:55:09,560
Romney was a placeholder

1381
01:55:09,560 --> 01:55:14,080
and now we're seeing the fruits of it so I'm gonna do a report this week that

1382
01:55:14,080 --> 01:55:18,720
Obama why Obama really is a dictator that is his office has become a

1383
01:55:18,720 --> 01:55:23,340
manufactured synthetic presidency and the only word for that is dictatorship

1384
01:55:23,340 --> 01:55:27,840
and he's acting dictatorial with all these edicts again normally I say get

1385
01:55:27,840 --> 01:55:31,000
rid of the Department of Education get rid of all these groups because we

1386
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:34,200
shouldn't have them running our local schools we should have taxes cut keep

1387
01:55:34,200 --> 01:55:40,360
the taxes in the state but I've got to say because the law plugs in to the

1388
01:55:40,360 --> 01:55:45,480
Small Business Administration it's designed to make sure the money does go

1389
01:55:45,480 --> 01:55:51,280
to the lowest bid contractor who has a good track record in the 50 states not

1390
01:55:51,280 --> 01:55:55,720
to foreign globalist so what will Obama's trying to shut this

1391
01:55:55,720 --> 01:56:05,700
administration down do you know when when you're talking about Obama there's

1392
01:56:05,700 --> 01:56:09,560
been a number of federal investigations during his administration and I'm just

1393
01:56:09,560 --> 01:56:14,920
reading these these reports and all the reports say that his administration is

1394
01:56:14,920 --> 01:56:18,320
diverting these federal funds and by law should be going to the middle class for

1395
01:56:18,320 --> 01:56:23,280
some of the biggest companies in the world you know Lockheed Boeing north north

1396
01:56:23,280 --> 01:56:30,720
of Raytheon Finn mechanic in Italy rose born in Russia companies and in South

1397
01:56:30,720 --> 01:56:34,960
Korea so it's just it's just a tragedy if you really want to know who Barack

1398
01:56:34,960 --> 01:56:40,480
Obama is he's he's a man in the middle of the worst economic downturn in 80

1399
01:56:40,480 --> 01:56:44,720
years when the statistics show irrefutably that small businesses create

1400
01:56:44,720 --> 01:56:49,600
between 99 percent of jobs he's doing everything he can to take that money and

1401
01:56:49,600 --> 01:56:54,280
divert it to the large businesses that most likely have created one job in 30

1402
01:56:54,280 --> 01:56:58,880
years and the law says he can't do that and remember the law he's breaking the

1403
01:56:58,880 --> 01:57:03,520
law to do that and the corporate whore media is barely starting to cover it I

1404
01:57:03,520 --> 01:57:06,380
want to warn everybody that works for the system you're not going to have a

1405
01:57:06,380 --> 01:57:10,520
country anymore if you don't stop things like this the reason we have you on five

1406
01:57:10,520 --> 01:57:14,180
or six times a year mr. Chapman is because what you're saying is a real

1407
01:57:14,180 --> 01:57:20,440
solution have the money go back to America it is a no-brainer it there

1408
01:57:20,440 --> 01:57:24,280
there's no logic I would love to have anybody in the country of Obama's

1409
01:57:24,280 --> 01:57:29,060
biggest supporter explain to me you know how it's good for America to take our

1410
01:57:29,060 --> 01:57:33,880
tax dollars that by law should be going to American companies and giving it to a

1411
01:57:33,880 --> 01:57:37,400
Russian-owned international arms dealer are some of the biggest companies in

1412
01:57:37,400 --> 01:57:42,880
Europe and Asia there there's no way to to to explain that by the way are you

1413
01:57:42,880 --> 01:57:46,200
are you familiar with Obama's Jobs Council I saw a story about that the

1414
01:57:46,200 --> 01:57:49,960
everyday tell folks about that oh well Obama's got a Jobs Council of all

1415
01:57:49,960 --> 01:57:54,600
fortune 500 firms now according to again the US Census Bureau and the Kauffman

1416
01:57:54,600 --> 01:58:00,320
Foundation it doesn't look like fortune 500 firms have created one job in 30

1417
01:58:00,320 --> 01:58:05,240
years and that's who Obama's Jobs Council the president was ahead of GE

1418
01:58:05,240 --> 01:58:10,120
GE is shipping more American jobs overseas the other company so it's

1419
01:58:10,120 --> 01:58:14,600
insane in a clear in the aggregate and then those are cut numbers is actually

1420
01:58:14,600 --> 01:58:18,640
worse we're losing jobs but in the aggregate not one new job from fortune

1421
01:58:18,640 --> 01:58:24,280
500 almost what is it 97% are made by the small businesses and then meanwhile

1422
01:58:24,280 --> 01:58:27,080
but see that's what he does oh we don't have 50 states anymore we have a

1423
01:58:27,080 --> 01:58:31,240
governor's council I appoint oh we don't have local counties anymore we have a

1424
01:58:31,240 --> 01:58:36,080
rural council I created that's what he does he creates a counterfeit that then

1425
01:58:36,080 --> 01:58:42,560
is represented by the globalist we'll be back stay with us you are listening to

Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN radio network

1440
02:00:05,240 --> 02:00:12,680
big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does

1441
02:00:12,680 --> 02:00:20,320
he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas

1442
02:00:20,320 --> 02:00:23,640
Alex Jones

1443
02:00:24,840 --> 02:00:30,400
all right Max Keiser is coming up to the balance of the hour after the break Lloyd

1444
02:00:30,400 --> 02:00:36,400
Chapman is our guest right now with the ASBL.com American Small Business League

1445
02:00:36,400 --> 02:00:44,840
the globalists are getting rid of all the agencies not the bureaucrats but the

1446
02:00:44,840 --> 02:00:48,840
command structure in the mandate because these agencies are mandated by law if

1447
02:00:48,840 --> 02:00:53,320
Obama creates a new agency it's still illegal but somehow he can put new

1448
02:00:53,320 --> 02:00:56,240
people in who will just do whatever he says because bureaucrats have got

1449
02:00:56,240 --> 02:00:59,880
problems but a lot of them are like yeah in fact in all their studies are like

1450
02:00:59,880 --> 02:01:02,680
yeah this is supposed to go to local businesses US businesses small

1451
02:01:02,680 --> 02:01:07,640
businesses it's not happening and so they don't even like their own agencies

1452
02:01:07,640 --> 02:01:12,600
so just get rid of it because you know as bad as some bureaucrats are they're

1453
02:01:12,600 --> 02:01:18,960
basically committing suicide politically and economically there's some other

1454
02:01:18,960 --> 02:01:24,960
breaking news up at infowars.com that is so incredible so incredible video

1455
02:01:24,960 --> 02:01:29,360
photographer attacked by Metro security for taking pictures and filming yeah

1456
02:01:29,360 --> 02:01:34,400
more and more police are and and security people are beating people up

1457
02:01:34,400 --> 02:01:38,280
even on the street corners or arresting them for filming I mean government does

1458
02:01:38,280 --> 02:01:43,040
not want you filming and this is crazy we'll have to show some of that and talk

1459
02:01:43,040 --> 02:01:47,640
about it as well that's up at infowars.com let's go back to Lloyd Chapman

1460
02:01:47,640 --> 02:01:50,160
look we're almost out of time I know you wanted to comment on the Piers Morgan

1461
02:01:50,160 --> 02:01:54,240
thing give us a quick comment on that and then what we can do to help defeat

1462
02:01:54,240 --> 02:01:59,800
Obama getting rid of this agency and ignoring the law I love you on Piers

1463
02:01:59,800 --> 02:02:03,600
Morgan by the way I've watched it several times I loved it now you told us

1464
02:02:03,600 --> 02:02:05,920
that in the email you wanted to make a comment so go ahead what's your take on

1465
02:02:05,920 --> 02:02:11,520
it well here's what Piers Morgan doesn't understand FBI says about 20 children a

1466
02:02:11,520 --> 02:02:18,160
year killed in schools 1,500 a year killed by their parents and parents

1467
02:02:18,160 --> 02:02:23,080
more children are killed by lightning if you've got a child in school they're

1468
02:02:23,080 --> 02:02:26,920
more likely to die from a lightning strike than they are in school a

1469
02:02:26,920 --> 02:02:34,600
thousand kids a year commit suicide more kids are killed by bee stings then guns

1470
02:02:34,600 --> 02:02:39,400
in schools and about the same number of children are killed by dogs every year

1471
02:02:39,400 --> 02:02:44,120
as they are guns in schools guns in schools are not a problem children being

1472
02:02:44,120 --> 02:02:49,240
killed by guns in school is not in the top ten reasons children die three

1473
02:02:49,240 --> 02:02:54,440
thousand children a year die from head injuries riding their bicycles so when

1474
02:02:54,440 --> 02:02:58,720
you talk about these average over the last decade of 21 children you're being

1475
02:02:58,720 --> 02:03:03,160
killed in schools it's statistically insignificant it's not even in the top

1476
02:03:03,160 --> 02:03:08,880
ten reasons on the Piers Morgan show you mentioned 11,000 people in America killed

1477
02:03:08,880 --> 02:03:16,360
by gun violence ten times as many people in America die from the known side

1478
02:03:16,360 --> 02:03:23,160
effects of properly prescribed and properly taken pharmaceutical drugs ten

1479
02:03:23,160 --> 02:03:27,240
times as many people it's a total fear-mongering hoax manipulating our

1480
02:03:27,240 --> 02:03:33,520
hearts absolutely it's a tragedy that those 20 children got killed but again

1481
02:03:33,520 --> 02:03:37,360
they're more there they're 75 times more likely to be killed by their parents

1482
02:03:37,360 --> 02:03:41,760
they're twice as likely to get struck by lightning so it's it's actually

1483
02:03:41,760 --> 02:03:46,280
statistically insignificant and if anybody like Piers Morgan wants to worry

1484
02:03:46,280 --> 02:03:50,080
about saving children he needs to you know launch a program to protect them

1485
02:03:50,080 --> 02:03:55,960
from these prescription drugs here's the problem they all know this stuff they

1486
02:03:55,960 --> 02:04:01,400
want to disarm us why do they want to disarm us in your view well I think that

1487
02:04:01,400 --> 02:04:06,160
you know when you look at the home of security buying you know 1.8 billion

1488
02:04:06,160 --> 02:04:10,680
rounds of hollow point bullets and urban assault vehicles and surveillance drones

1489
02:04:10,680 --> 02:04:15,600
they got something in mind that we don't know about and they want to disarm us

1490
02:04:15,600 --> 02:04:19,920
and of course as you've talked about a million times disarming the people's the

1491
02:04:19,920 --> 02:04:24,600
first thing that dictators always have always sent throughout history and it's

1492
02:04:24,600 --> 02:04:28,080
the opposite the founding fathers one of the founding fathers wanted us to have

1493
02:04:28,080 --> 02:04:31,640
the firepower to overthrow the government if ever if the government

1494
02:04:31,640 --> 02:04:35,360
came oppressive a pierce morgan talks about why do you need assault rifle why

1495
02:04:35,360 --> 02:04:38,840
you need 30 shot clip well when the government stormtroopers start kicking

1496
02:04:38,840 --> 02:04:42,560
in your front door with automatic weapons with 30 shot clips you're gonna

1497
02:04:42,560 --> 02:04:46,280
want you know an assault rifle 30 shot clip to try to defend you and your

1498
02:04:46,280 --> 02:04:50,740
family so people need to understand assault rifles and 30 shot clips are

1499
02:04:50,740 --> 02:04:54,020
not for hunting they're not to protect your home there to make sure that the

1555
02:09:43,960 --> 02:09:48,560
get you on about the economy because you know they're buying urban assault

1557
02:09:53,320 --> 02:09:57,240
declassified gearing up like it's the end of the world and you believe that by

1558
02:09:57,240 --> 02:10:01,360
the end of April we're gonna see the next phase and implosion we're already

1559
02:10:01,360 --> 02:10:07,520
in an implosion they just use more debt and welfare checks and you know the

1560
02:10:07,520 --> 02:10:12,480
government little credit cards to keep things going it's a consolidation

1561
02:10:12,480 --> 02:10:17,280
program but now we've seen a bunch of countries the biggest of which Germany

1562
02:10:17,280 --> 02:10:22,920
the key to the EU repatriating their gold saying saying in the news I saw in

1563
02:10:22,920 --> 02:10:27,880
the Financial Times we don't trust the US anymore so even the crux in running

1564
02:10:27,880 --> 02:10:32,440
Germany don't trust the crux over here so are we seeing that creeping towards

1565
02:10:32,440 --> 02:10:36,400
the exits that you've warned about then we'll get into the your take on the

1566
02:10:36,400 --> 02:10:41,680
Second Amendment what's coming up in the economy this African invasion or even

1567
02:10:41,680 --> 02:10:45,360
mainstream news is saying terror in North Africa our Westerners pulling the

1568
02:10:45,360 --> 02:10:49,680
strings of al-qaeda I mean even mainstream news now goes is is NATO in

1569
02:10:49,680 --> 02:10:55,040
the u.s. staging stuff to be able to invade duh duh look at Libya look at

1570
02:10:55,040 --> 02:11:00,520
Syria again joining us max Kaiser max so much is happening I hope that your bold

1571
02:11:00,520 --> 02:11:05,000
prediction is not true but unfortunately it looks like we're creeping towards the

1572
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:08,280
eve of financial collapse we'll talk about what that collapse will look like

1573
02:11:08,280 --> 02:11:14,680
as well max Kaiser yeah well nice to be on again and thanks for coming on my

1574
02:11:14,680 --> 02:11:21,120
show and I think you describe it well creeping toward the exits and this is

1575
02:11:21,120 --> 02:11:26,840
what the German gold repatriation story is all about and as you point out the

1576
02:11:26,840 --> 02:11:34,000
central banks have lost trust in each other and they are taking their gold out

1577
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:38,880
of banks in respective vaults around the world and they're bringing it all home

1578
02:11:38,880 --> 02:11:46,080
and they're doing this in a way that will precipitate and accelerate this

1579
02:11:46,080 --> 02:11:51,600
collapse that we've been talking about and to give you an idea for how this all

1580
02:11:51,600 --> 02:11:57,440
works in Britain for example the government says they have 300 tons of

1581
02:11:57,440 --> 02:12:02,520
gold here in Britain but my sources tell me that they have leased out or sold

1582
02:12:02,520 --> 02:12:09,480
over a thousand tons so we have a fractional gold standard around the

1583
02:12:09,480 --> 02:12:14,400
world that is keeping these central banks afloat and now that they all want

1584
02:12:14,400 --> 02:12:19,400
their gold back they find out that the gold's not there back when Germany took

1585
02:12:19,400 --> 02:12:26,760
900 tons from Britain back during the 2000 2001 period Gordon Brown to

1586
02:12:26,760 --> 02:12:32,240
satisfy Britain's dissatisfied Germany's demand for gold to be sent back in

1587
02:12:32,240 --> 02:12:39,120
Germany at that time he ended up having to sell 400 tons of Britain's gold so

1588
02:12:39,120 --> 02:12:43,880
Britain had to sell 400 tons and that's about over well over a trillion dollars

1589
02:12:43,880 --> 02:12:48,360
now that he gave away because the price of gold at that time was 250 dollars an

1590
02:12:48,360 --> 02:12:53,400
ounce now it's $1,700 an ounce and this is this is a problem going forward the

1591
02:12:53,400 --> 02:12:57,040
Netherlands want their gold Germany wants their gold China's buying gold but

1592
02:12:57,040 --> 02:13:00,240
these central banks that say that they have gold it's turned out that they

1593
02:13:00,240 --> 02:13:06,600
actually leased the gold which is a way for them to to put on their books that

1594
02:13:06,600 --> 02:13:10,360
they still own the gold when when the Fort Knox for example when they lease

1595
02:13:10,360 --> 02:13:15,880
the gold and they claim that that is as good as owning the gold itself but when

1596
02:13:15,880 --> 02:13:19,160
if you were to audit the Fort Knox you would find that most of the gold has

1597
02:13:19,160 --> 02:13:23,800
been leased and that means sold so when people come then to claim their gold

1598
02:13:23,800 --> 02:13:29,120
they find that it's not there the Bank of New York when Germany it says that

1599
02:13:29,120 --> 02:13:34,080
they want the gold over seven years well as a panic in the gold market builds

1600
02:13:34,080 --> 02:13:37,600
they're gonna want that gold a lot sooner and they're gonna be told that we

1601
02:13:37,600 --> 02:13:41,520
don't have the gold to give you because we sold it I want to stop you right

1602
02:13:41,520 --> 02:13:47,400
there because something I want to do when we're able to budget in hiring a

1603
02:13:47,400 --> 02:13:51,760
researcher or an archiver is when I have guests on like you I'm gonna have them

1604
02:13:51,760 --> 02:13:58,280
sit there and put the key points you say basically into a scroll at the bottom

1605
02:13:58,280 --> 02:14:03,080
like mainstream television but also put it on a computer so we can search a

1606
02:14:03,080 --> 02:14:08,680
database of when you've been on the radio slash TV show because max at

1607
02:14:08,680 --> 02:14:13,720
nauseum for about two years in almost every interview so there's probably 20

1608
02:14:13,720 --> 02:14:18,180
of these you have said that you'll know that it's about to collapse when they

1609
02:14:18,180 --> 02:14:24,040
start demanding gold from Britain and from the US and that they've leveraged

1610
02:14:24,040 --> 02:14:28,800
it at least ten to one in fractional reserve and that it's the fraud of the

1611
02:14:28,800 --> 02:14:32,880
silver and gold reserves that will finally bring them down and that they

1612
02:14:32,880 --> 02:14:36,320
want to have a controlled collapse without this happening but that if they

1613
02:14:36,320 --> 02:14:40,520
do go for the gold and silver this way that that's a signal that things are out

1614
02:14:40,520 --> 02:14:45,760
of control now now you've said that over and over and over again and my guests

1615
02:14:45,760 --> 02:14:48,640
through this all the time because we have guests on that are right they could

1616
02:14:48,640 --> 02:14:52,320
have guests on that were right on national TV here in mainstream news but

1617
02:14:52,320 --> 02:14:55,480
they don't want you to be right they don't want the slaves to know what they

1618
02:14:55,480 --> 02:14:59,280
know but max you're scaring me because you've said this over and over again

1619
02:14:59,280 --> 02:15:04,240
that this would be the sign and now it's not just Germany demanding the gold from

1620
02:15:04,240 --> 02:15:08,040
the US and England in places this is really scary so you've got the floor

1621
02:15:08,040 --> 02:15:11,760
till we got a break in five minutes break down how you knew this was coming

1622
02:15:11,760 --> 02:15:17,080
and what this signifies and how you think they'll satisfy at this time it

1623
02:15:17,080 --> 02:15:23,560
started really back in 2008 on March 17th of 2008 Stacy Herbert and I we were

1624
02:15:23,560 --> 02:15:27,520
making a documentary we were in Frankfurt Germany we were at the

1625
02:15:27,520 --> 02:15:32,640
boondis bank and we were talking to people at the boondis bank and this was

1626
02:15:32,640 --> 02:15:36,760
right when Bear Stearns was collapsing and gold shot up above a thousand

1627
02:15:36,760 --> 02:15:43,440
dollars an ounce and he ended up there at a very historic moment and I asked

1628
02:15:43,440 --> 02:15:47,920
you know I'd like to see the gold and the response from the boondis bank was

1629
02:15:47,920 --> 02:15:54,880
well you know most of it is in New York now that that film was later broadcast

1630
02:15:54,880 --> 02:16:00,840
Al Jazeera English and it was a shock to the people in Germany and another

1631
02:16:00,840 --> 02:16:05,840
journalist named Lars Scholl picked it picked up the ball and he's been

1632
02:16:05,840 --> 02:16:11,080
hammering journalists and bankers now every year for four years until the

1633
02:16:11,080 --> 02:16:15,520
point where boondis bank came out and said due to the popular pressure we are

1634
02:16:15,520 --> 02:16:21,440
we have have to admit that we have these huge gold positions held in the New York

1635
02:16:21,440 --> 02:16:25,600
Fed and we're going to now repatriate this gold we're taking the gold back and

1636
02:16:25,600 --> 02:16:30,400
then my sources tell me that the New York Fed said well we don't want you to

1637
02:16:30,400 --> 02:16:34,520
start a run on the gold market so we're gonna space this out over seven years

1638
02:16:34,520 --> 02:16:39,240
and but this was really going back to what we discovered in 2008 which is that

1639
02:16:39,240 --> 02:16:43,520
the gold that these banks say that they have they don't have and this set off a

1640
02:16:43,520 --> 02:16:49,080
fire you know a trigger now over the past four or five years what you have is

1641
02:16:49,080 --> 02:16:55,080
central banks and governments to keep the economies afloat have been

1642
02:16:55,080 --> 02:17:01,160
aggressively buying their own bonds they call it quantitative easing and you know

1643
02:17:01,160 --> 02:17:04,280
your other guests talk about this like Gerald Cilenti talks about this a lot

1644
02:17:04,280 --> 02:17:09,280
they buy their own bonds as a way to keep interest rates low or to keep bond

1645
02:17:09,280 --> 02:17:13,200
prices high now here's an amazing statistic the bond price in America has

1646
02:17:13,200 --> 02:17:19,560
not been as high as it is today in the 240 years that America has existed the

1647
02:17:19,560 --> 02:17:24,080
bond price the government bond price in the UK and Britain has not been as high

1648
02:17:24,080 --> 02:17:31,560
since 1694 when the Bank of England was created the bonds are where the dot-com

1649
02:17:31,560 --> 02:17:36,600
was in 2000 it's where the stock market was in 1987 it's where the real estate

1650
02:17:36,600 --> 02:17:42,920
market was in 2005 there it's a historic peak at a bubble peak now whether the

1651
02:17:42,920 --> 02:17:48,280
bonds collapse between now and April as I predicted on your show last year it

1652
02:17:48,280 --> 02:17:52,480
could happen I think it could happen I might be wrong but I won't be wrong by

1653
02:17:52,480 --> 02:17:56,520
much I could be wrong by a few weeks a few months but that's what we're going

1654
02:17:56,520 --> 02:18:01,520
to see we're going to see bonds collapse we're gonna see gold now panic buying in

1655
02:18:01,520 --> 02:18:06,880
the gold market taking gold a lot higher and of course it's all ties in to what

1656
02:18:06,880 --> 02:18:12,280
we launched on your show two years ago crash JP Morgan by silver the price of

1657
02:18:12,280 --> 02:18:17,320
silver was around 26 we at that time there was such a furor to buy silver it

1658
02:18:17,320 --> 02:18:22,240
moved up to be pulled back now to the low 30s but now we're seeing the price

1659
02:18:22,240 --> 02:18:27,040
of silver after this consolidation period now looks like it's going along

1660
02:18:27,040 --> 02:18:30,440
with gold you're going to see new highs and silver so silver will get over 50

1661
02:18:30,440 --> 02:18:34,920
60 70 dollars an ounce but that's that that those are individuals now who don't

1662
02:18:34,920 --> 02:18:38,480
trust the banking system they're not just governments and for individuals

1663
02:18:38,480 --> 02:18:43,360
they reach for silver because it's a lot easier to get it's cheaper and max the

1664
02:18:43,360 --> 02:18:48,200
public here going to break they're all buying survival goods shelters guns

1665
02:18:48,200 --> 02:18:53,240
they're voting with their purchases shelling they don't trust the system the

1666
02:18:53,240 --> 02:18:56,720
elites are all buying armored redoubts and getting bodyguards they don't trust

1667
02:18:56,720 --> 02:19:02,520
the system this looks like quite a mess we're going to enter well there's a good

1668
02:19:02,520 --> 02:19:06,840
point you're making there because it's the to contrast today with the 1930s

1669
02:19:06,840 --> 02:19:11,040
people say this is similar to 1930s there's a big difference between now

1670
02:19:11,040 --> 02:19:17,160
1930s in the 1930s there was a liquidity problem banks needed cash to keep their

1671
02:19:17,160 --> 02:19:21,960
business going for their deposits but today if that's not the problem the

1672
02:19:21,960 --> 02:19:28,440
problem is an insolvency issue these big to failed to too big to fail banks they

1673
02:19:28,440 --> 02:19:33,360
are technically insolvent they're zombie back they're being kept alive with this

1674
02:19:33,360 --> 02:19:36,800
money printing that they're the politicians tell us what we need to print

1675
02:19:36,800 --> 02:19:40,360
the money we don't want to repeat the mistakes of the 1930s that's false it's

1676
02:19:40,360 --> 02:19:44,560
not like the 1930s it's not a liquidity issue it's an insolvency issue and

1677
02:19:44,560 --> 02:19:48,400
they're keeping the banks alive with this cheap money and 0% interest rates

1678
02:19:48,400 --> 02:19:53,600
to keep their buddies afloat all right stay there stay there by the way kvue is

1679
02:19:53,600 --> 02:19:57,880
reporting CNN refuses to show live coverage very suspicious mass shooting

1680
02:19:57,880 --> 02:20:03,560
at Lone Star College in Houston we'll be back hello I'm Alex Jones myself my

develops at least three people shot at Lone Star College in Houston and and I

1728
02:24:28,080 --> 02:24:32,200
walked out there during the break and CNN's going we're not going to show live

1729

1730
02:24:39,720 --> 02:24:47,160
who is is KHOU so we need to go to their website KHOU and KVUE has it so we've

1731
02:24:47,160 --> 02:24:51,200
now reached the point where CNN will not show you what's happening oh because we

1732
02:24:51,200 --> 02:24:55,400
might see other shooters in camo getting arrested and then we're told oh no the

1733
02:24:55,400 --> 02:25:00,200
five-year-olds saw that we never put that on the news oh you know go back to

1734
02:25:00,200 --> 02:25:04,760
sleep this is an operation Gladio we're not we're not staging something I tell

1735
02:25:04,760 --> 02:25:08,080
you Max Keiser people can debate you know whether a gun culture is a good

1736
02:25:08,080 --> 02:25:11,040
thing or a bad thing when anti-state folks don't like guns we know they're

1737
02:25:11,040 --> 02:25:14,480
here to protect us from tyranny but why is the government arming to the teeth

1738
02:25:14,480 --> 02:25:18,040
while rushing to disarm us is it because they don't want us to be armed during

1739
02:25:18,040 --> 02:25:25,240
the collapse I think that's a pretty fair statement the the bond when the

1740
02:25:25,240 --> 02:25:29,160
bond market collapses as we've talked about because it's a bubble it's in a

1741
02:25:29,160 --> 02:25:33,680
300 year high bubble and I look at what's happening in the markets to give

1742
02:25:33,680 --> 02:25:38,600
me a clue what the big money is doing and I know that JP Morgan over the past

1743
02:25:38,600 --> 02:25:44,320
couple of years has been developing huge positions monopoly like positions and

1744
02:25:44,320 --> 02:25:51,880
food copper industrial metals and in precious metals and they're doing so

1745
02:25:51,880 --> 02:25:55,760
because they know what's coming that hyperinflation is coming and they want

1746
02:25:55,760 --> 02:25:59,760
to be able to totally control that market for example JP Morgan Justin got

1747
02:25:59,760 --> 02:26:05,760
involved in launching an exchange-traded fund for copper so that means and they

1748
02:26:05,760 --> 02:26:10,280
and before they did so they bought something like 20% of the world's copper

1749
02:26:10,280 --> 02:26:14,320
supply so now the price of copper is going to start going up aggressively

1750
02:26:14,320 --> 02:26:19,160
higher because it's being manipulated higher because JP Morgan and the bankers

1751
02:26:19,160 --> 02:26:22,880
on Wall Street there will want to make have a new way to make money it's going

1752
02:26:22,880 --> 02:26:26,560
to be on commodities they've made all the money they possibly can over 30

1753
02:26:26,560 --> 02:26:30,280
years in the bond market because the bond market the interest rate under Paul

1754
02:26:30,280 --> 02:26:35,080
Volcker got 15 to 16 percent on the 10-year bond it hit this huge high on the

1755
02:26:35,080 --> 02:26:39,360
interest rate and during the past 30 years now gone down to zero during that

1756
02:26:39,360 --> 02:26:43,840
30-year period was the biggest bull market on Wall Street in history selling

1757
02:26:43,840 --> 02:26:49,960
bonds and bond related equities and stocks and options etc now that 30-year

1758
02:26:49,960 --> 02:26:53,760
period is over and we're going to answer into a period of commodity price

1759
02:26:53,760 --> 02:26:58,240
appreciation JP Morgan already knows it Goldman Sachs already knows it and

1760
02:26:58,240 --> 02:27:03,200
they're buying huge positions into these markets and as far as what's going you

1761
02:27:03,200 --> 02:27:08,520
know in in the US if the price of food gets to a certain level it causes

1762
02:27:08,520 --> 02:27:13,440
riots we know historically that when the price of food gets to around 40% of an

1763
02:27:13,440 --> 02:27:18,320
individual's income you look for a riot that's the point that got to in Egypt

1764
02:27:18,320 --> 02:27:23,200
before the Egyptians staged a riot revolution in their country and they

1765
02:27:23,200 --> 02:27:26,800
don't want us armed so that we can't protect ourselves but that might

1766
02:27:26,800 --> 02:27:30,840
actually cause total rioting or even the government gets taken down but the

1767
02:27:30,840 --> 02:27:35,000
tyrant's instinct is to disarm us so much they still don't care but

1768
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:38,200
historically if they take the general public's guns that will make the

1769
02:27:38,200 --> 02:27:43,840
government even more unstable so in the u.s. the average American spends

1770
02:27:43,840 --> 02:27:48,680
something in the order of 12 to 15 percent of their income on food and

1771
02:27:48,680 --> 02:27:54,080
that's still you know it's not at 40% but as prices now begin to go up

1772
02:27:54,080 --> 02:27:58,720
because of the manipulation coming in the collapse of the bond market and the

1773
02:27:58,720 --> 02:28:02,080
loss of purchasing power from the dollar you're going to get to the point where

1774
02:28:02,080 --> 02:28:07,280
the food costs are going to be out of reach for a very very large percentage

1775
02:28:07,280 --> 02:28:11,160
of the population and so stay there stay there we gotta go to break but I've got

1776
02:28:11,160 --> 02:28:16,720
to play just a minute or so this is kho you and out there on dish Network and

1777
02:28:16,720 --> 02:28:20,320
the other cable we've got CNN says they won't show it live we're watching it

1778
02:28:20,320 --> 02:28:23,380
live they don't want you hearing the original eyewitness accounts this is

1779
02:28:23,380 --> 02:28:30,320
very suspicious turn it up and students are not right yeah correct so basically

1780
02:28:30,320 --> 02:28:36,240
uh this is live at 128 and soon as I heard the bullet the bullets flying

1781
02:28:36,240 --> 02:28:41,200
whatever the gun being you know fired off CNN will not let you see this you

1782
02:28:41,200 --> 02:28:46,520
know that was hit very suspicious so you ran right yeah I ran because uh

1783
02:28:46,520 --> 02:28:51,380
basically here's found that you know out of the ordinary you're gonna run so you

1784
02:28:51,380 --> 02:28:54,360
know that's just again why don't they want people to hear what happened live

1785
02:28:54,360 --> 02:28:57,480
get out the way because I don't want to be a you know victim or anything that's

1786
02:28:57,480 --> 02:29:02,080
a Brittany Mobley she's a student here at Lone Star College on the Northside

1787
02:29:02,080 --> 02:29:06,160
campus you can see there is still plenty of law enforcement activity here on the

1788
02:29:06,160 --> 02:29:10,360
scene they are allowing students to leave we're not sure how much

1789
02:29:10,360 --> 02:29:13,240
communication is going on to students other than they're being told that they

1790
02:29:13,240 --> 02:29:17,580
can leave but probably not come back today at are they supposed to get in the

1791
02:29:17,580 --> 02:29:21,340
fetal position as I can tell you look at me a higher death toll the road it's one

1792
02:29:21,340 --> 02:29:25,280
of the entrances off of Aldine Westfield there's another checkpoint all the way

1793
02:29:25,280 --> 02:29:28,960
down back here on the other side tell us how many dead point where we're told

1794
02:29:28,960 --> 02:29:33,220
that some vehicles potentially even all vehicles from students here on this

1795
02:29:33,220 --> 02:29:37,220
scene nobody's dead as they leave one officer did tell me I hope this

crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones on the

1839
02:33:07,280 --> 02:33:11,440
GCN radio network

1840
02:33:11,440 --> 02:33:16,160
you know why they want only a few globalist controlled national news

1841
02:33:16,160 --> 02:33:19,640
networks because they want to be able to control the narrative and tell you what

1842
02:33:19,640 --> 02:33:29,280
they want we are showing KHOU 11 on screen right now for TV viewers at

1843
02:33:29,280 --> 02:33:35,600
info Wars calm and of course we're doing it via fair use of a news event here in

1844
02:33:35,600 --> 02:33:40,000
our state to document what's happening CNN during the break we've got it

1845
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:44,200
recorded we're gonna have a report out on this said quote I just saw it again

1846
02:33:44,200 --> 02:33:50,520
we are not letting you see live feeds because of what you might see and it is

1847
02:33:50,520 --> 02:33:54,960
bodies laying on the ground with paramedics around them looks like from

1848
02:33:54,960 --> 02:34:00,000
helicopter with a shot where you can't even make out of their male or female I

1849
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:04,760
mean you got shoot-em-up video games mass murder on TV in the 60s they'd show

1850
02:34:04,760 --> 02:34:09,920
kids naked running down rice paddy roads with their skin hanging off because

1851
02:34:09,920 --> 02:34:15,560
it was documentary that's why in old radio they would allow cussing only if

1852
02:34:15,560 --> 02:34:19,240
it was a real event that happened not because people wanted to hear cussing

1853
02:34:19,240 --> 02:34:23,040
but because you want to hear what really happened for documentary purposes that's

1854
02:34:23,040 --> 02:34:26,040
why when I was a kid I'd watch PBS and they'd have some you know thing about a

1855
02:34:26,040 --> 02:34:30,520
historical event that happened the 50s and there'd be cussing on it because

1856
02:34:30,520 --> 02:34:36,560
it's real so of course we should see whatever this is in 2013 see they tell

1857
02:34:36,560 --> 02:34:41,720
you can see all the simulated torture and murder and death you want in movies

1858
02:34:41,720 --> 02:34:45,160
you name it I just like Time Warner's putting out all these violent movies but

1859
02:34:45,160 --> 02:34:50,760
now saying nobody can advertise guns on any Time Warner magazine TV show cable

1860
02:34:50,760 --> 02:34:54,760
network you name it Max Keiser is our guest he always seems to come on when

1861
02:34:54,760 --> 02:34:57,560
there's a big news event this happened like three times the last three times he

1862
02:34:57,560 --> 02:35:03,740
was on Max Keiser syndicated TV host radio host you name it max Keiser calm

1863
02:35:03,740 --> 02:35:08,440
max what do you make of this new phenomenon because I've never seen them

1864
02:35:08,440 --> 02:35:11,760
do this where they say oh it's too hurtful what like a little girl has a

1865
02:35:11,760 --> 02:35:17,720
Hello Kitty bubble machine I actually bought these for my kids you pull the

1866
02:35:17,720 --> 02:35:21,080
trigger and you stick it it's not even meant to be a quote gun it's a thing to

1867
02:35:21,080 --> 02:35:24,740
hold and put bubbles a little pink Hello Kitty deal and the police came and

1868
02:35:24,740 --> 02:35:28,940
grabbed the little girl because a bubble things she had kids are being arrest for

1869
02:35:28,940 --> 02:35:33,200
nerf guns that are orange or being being detained I mean this is like mind

1870
02:35:33,200 --> 02:35:37,480
control where you can have all the drones killing people all day that's

1871
02:35:37,480 --> 02:35:43,040
beautiful but but but but you're gonna get grabbed for Hello Kitty bubble toys

1872
02:35:43,040 --> 02:35:51,240
yeah well the media companies I think are panicking because the the frequency

1873
02:35:51,240 --> 02:35:57,360
of these mass shootings is getting is increasing and people's pointing

1874
02:35:57,360 --> 02:36:02,460
fingers in many directions including the big media companies so in the case they

1875
02:36:02,460 --> 02:36:07,500
they are conglomerates and they own film divisions they own TV divisions and they

1876
02:36:07,500 --> 02:36:14,400
own print divisions and they have movies that are showing an enormous amount of

1877
02:36:14,400 --> 02:36:18,240
mass slaughters and they've been making billions of dollars with these movies

1878
02:36:18,240 --> 02:36:22,080
and they also own news content divisions and now they're I think they're

1879
02:36:22,080 --> 02:36:28,380
completely stupefied because they don't want to upset their franchise selling

1880
02:36:28,380 --> 02:36:33,960
gory films by upsetting people by showing the real news I mean if you go

1881
02:36:33,960 --> 02:36:37,200
back the old history of the past 20 years there's a great film that came out

1882
02:36:37,200 --> 02:36:42,760
a while ago called fish show that Robert Redford made that show the transition

1883
02:36:42,760 --> 02:36:47,000
from news to game shows that happened in the 1950s and now we're going through a

1884
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:51,780
new transition where news has become and no news you're not allowed to see news

1885
02:36:51,780 --> 02:36:55,640
anymore you're only allowed to see simulated events and simulated news

1886
02:36:55,640 --> 02:37:00,680
because the real news would if you watch it and you're injured we can't it might

1887
02:37:00,680 --> 02:37:05,400
create a liability that we're then liable for only the controlled violence

1888
02:37:05,400 --> 02:37:11,440
that's completely insured are we able to show you so I see this as just another

1889
02:37:11,440 --> 02:37:16,640
symptom of a society the American society fueled with cheap money cheap

1890
02:37:16,640 --> 02:37:21,080
drugs and other than the rest of it it's just a break it's just a disintegrate

1891
02:37:21,080 --> 02:37:24,440
we're gonna go to a witness turn her up go ahead CNN doesn't want you to see

1892
02:37:24,440 --> 02:37:26,840
this here is for radio why don't you tell me what you saw no actually I

1893
02:37:26,840 --> 02:37:30,520
wasn't in the library was a friend in the lab that's right and they came she

1894
02:37:30,520 --> 02:37:36,680
came to our class 308 and to get somebody out of class and to tell them

1895
02:37:36,680 --> 02:37:40,920
that it was a lot of shooting going on well of course that scared us so what

1896
02:37:40,920 --> 02:37:46,600
what happened was that we all just cut off the lights we shut down all the

1897
02:37:46,600 --> 02:37:51,640
computers and the teacher told us is the closet just in case but to be quiet and

1898
02:37:51,640 --> 02:37:55,920
we was there for a while a long time and of course we started hearing the

1899
02:37:55,920 --> 02:38:01,800
helicopters but we finally got the internet on channel 11 and that's when

1900
02:38:01,800 --> 02:38:06,920
we found out what had actually happened I didn't hear the shooting but somebody

1901
02:38:06,920 --> 02:38:10,240
else did so because someone came into your classroom you hunkered down right

1902
02:38:10,240 --> 02:38:13,600
there in the classroom unbelievable that was the only way I will keep going back

1903
02:38:13,600 --> 02:38:17,120
to Max Kaiser while we run this video but let me just point out I've made the

1904
02:38:17,120 --> 02:38:21,600
point that why don't we just train people to line up back to back so one

1905
02:38:21,600 --> 02:38:25,280
bullet could kill three people because I mean that's the only step more

1906
02:38:25,280 --> 02:38:31,040
ridiculous than these these these colleges and public schools training

1907
02:38:31,040 --> 02:38:34,680
people to get in fetal positions and wait to be killed I mean if there's a

1908
02:38:34,680 --> 02:38:39,040
mass shooting people inside need to evacuate every time they knock the knock

1909
02:38:39,040 --> 02:38:43,960
the prison windows out toward is a prison to get out and and look overall

1910
02:38:43,960 --> 02:38:48,520
crime violent crimes going down FBI numbers but mass shootings are going up

1911
02:38:48,520 --> 02:38:51,920
because the media is advertising this and I want to point out what max is

1912
02:38:51,920 --> 02:38:56,480
talking about about fakeness presidents band pretended to punch up drugs here

1913
02:38:56,480 --> 02:39:02,440
for me turns out that was all fake Obama faked meeting with people faked videos

1914
02:39:02,440 --> 02:39:09,480
separate from the inauguration you know all recorded it's just again they the

1915
02:39:09,480 --> 02:39:13,760
establishment is going to everything being fake because real stuff might

1916
02:39:13,760 --> 02:39:18,960
get out of hand this shows the system is desperate you know I gotta say this max

1917
02:39:18,960 --> 02:39:24,480
is bad as things are right now the good news is I see panic and fear in the

1918
02:39:24,480 --> 02:39:28,840
establishment size they're power-grabbing right now and they're so

1919
02:39:28,840 --> 02:39:32,040
insulated I don't think this is going to go well for them I mean let me tell you

1920
02:39:32,040 --> 02:39:35,160
I'm not bragging about this I don't tell this story like I'm a big shot it's

1921
02:39:35,160 --> 02:39:39,240
actually pretty creepy and freaks me out and gives me anxiety I went to Big Bend

1922
02:39:39,240 --> 02:39:43,200
National Park on the Texas-Mexico border this weekend and there were people from

1923
02:39:43,200 --> 02:39:48,800
France there there were people from New York there California at some cases 80

1924
02:39:48,800 --> 02:39:53,320
percent of people if I stopped or something just you know to sit there and

1925
02:39:53,320 --> 02:39:58,160
take photos if I was in a congregated area would say Alex Jones Alex Jones and

1926
02:39:58,160 --> 02:40:00,880
it wasn't from really Piers Morgan I'd say how do you know about me I've been

1927
02:40:00,880 --> 02:40:06,320
listening for years listen when when when upwards of half or more of people

1928
02:40:06,320 --> 02:40:11,760
know who I am and say they agree no matter where I go now max I can go to

1929
02:40:11,760 --> 02:40:16,840
the hike and bike trail and in some cases everyone that comes by as a

1930
02:40:16,840 --> 02:40:21,600
listener I'm not bragging and saying I'm a big shot it's scary max because they

1931
02:40:21,600 --> 02:40:25,040
I mean that yeah I don't want to die they might come after me I don't know

1932
02:40:25,040 --> 02:40:29,440
how our numbers don't show we're this big yeah 15 million a week that the 15

1933
02:40:29,440 --> 02:40:33,000
million a week is not enough to have people from France knowing who you are

1934
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:37,200
yeah and then the next table knows who you are and then the waitress knows who

1935
02:40:37,200 --> 02:40:41,000
you are and it's and then one and then somebody else comes over I mean what's

1936
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:45,480
going on with that max well I've told you when I travel I've traveled in the

1937
02:40:45,480 --> 02:40:50,600
Mideast and around Europe and Asia and I people know me from the TV show and

1938
02:40:50,600 --> 02:40:56,520
almost invariably that people say and I watch Alex Jones and it's just the power

1939
02:40:56,520 --> 02:41:01,680
of the internet people watch your videos and the message resonates all over the

1940
02:41:01,680 --> 02:41:05,480
world and you're getting recognized all over and out I mean this is I mean the

1941
02:41:05,480 --> 02:41:10,440
establishment better be concerned well I think your message resonates outside of

1942
02:41:10,440 --> 02:41:14,320
America more than it does inside of America because people outside of

1943
02:41:14,320 --> 02:41:19,160
America have already been dealing with outright tyranny for decades for

1944
02:41:19,160 --> 02:41:23,560
generations and they know exactly what you're talking about it's only inside

1945
02:41:23,560 --> 02:41:28,640
America that your message falls on deaf ears in some cases because America has

1946
02:41:28,640 --> 02:41:34,520
been very quiet for decades now post World War two it's been a Shangri-La

1947
02:41:34,520 --> 02:41:39,800
it's been a happy town because we've benefited from winning that war and

1948
02:41:39,800 --> 02:41:45,800
we've had a 60-year run but that's coming to an end because a lot of the

1949
02:41:45,800 --> 02:41:50,360
trends that shape the good times are finishing and we're entering a new

1950
02:41:50,360 --> 02:41:54,360
period so it's it's funny that in your own country you're not as well

1951
02:41:54,360 --> 02:41:58,040
appreciated I think as you are it outside of your own country I can

1952
02:41:58,040 --> 02:42:01,840
anecdotally tell you that from traveling to these countries and hearing people

1953
02:42:01,840 --> 02:42:07,880
talk about you extremely with great fondness more so than I hear people from

1954
02:42:07,880 --> 02:42:11,880
the US well just to be clear I didn't even bring this up to say hey I'm really

1955
02:42:11,880 --> 02:42:18,520
big folks it's actually creepy because what I'm saying is is that the word is

1956
02:42:18,520 --> 02:42:21,680
getting out let me show people some of these headlines wrangle some of the

1957
02:42:21,680 --> 02:42:30,040
southern areas have cultures we have to overcome and CNS news even has video of

1958
02:42:30,040 --> 02:42:33,840
him saying this on the news I mean like like if you live in the south you're

1959
02:42:33,840 --> 02:42:37,680
just bad if you're a gun over you know you're a Nazi period lawmakers

1960
02:42:37,680 --> 02:42:41,240
introduced bills to ban high-capacity gun clips Texas sheriff's I will not

1961
02:42:41,240 --> 02:42:44,960
enforce law I consider unconstitutional same thing with Missouri sheriff's my

1962
02:42:44,960 --> 02:42:51,120
point is is look at this Sarkozy to move to London to avoid France's high taxes I

1963
02:42:51,120 --> 02:43:00,000
mean how far can these bureaucrats go till everything collapses this week in

1964
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:06,320
Switzerland of course it's Davos and Davos is really the the primo of all the

1965
02:43:06,320 --> 02:43:12,520
new world order get-togethers I think it might even be more influential than the

1966
02:43:12,520 --> 02:43:16,800
Bilderberg meetings because here you have in the highest mountains Switzerland

1967
02:43:16,800 --> 02:43:20,800
really the cream of the cream coming together and cutting deals and doing

1968
02:43:20,800 --> 02:43:26,280
deals and so it's happening this week and this is where now we'll find out a

1969
02:43:26,280 --> 02:43:30,840
couple of weeks what they decided to do in Davos and we'll find out what

1970
02:43:30,840 --> 02:43:35,640
companies got bought and who's who's gonna go after home and a lot of news

1971
02:43:35,640 --> 02:43:39,840
will come out out of it but I think Davos is really in in Europe is is the

1972
02:43:39,840 --> 02:43:45,000
number one event of the year for these guys these tyrants like Tim Geithner who

1973
02:43:45,000 --> 02:43:51,040
just came out the news that in 2008 2007 he was selling information to Wall

1974
02:43:51,040 --> 02:43:54,960
Street about which way the Fed and the Treasury were going to move interest

1975
02:43:54,960 --> 02:43:59,720
rates he was alerting the back you know private conversations essentially

1976
02:43:59,720 --> 02:44:03,720
selling information because that he go to Davos and he'll get paid a lot of

1977
02:44:03,720 --> 02:44:08,080
money from the folks that's where they the bag man you speeches as a way to get

1978
02:44:08,080 --> 02:44:12,000
paid off I remember you on the show with bags of money the Geithner and they're

1979
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:14,840
right there with their bank accounts you know he's already got caught cooking the

1980
02:44:14,840 --> 02:44:18,400
books for his own tax returns a few years ago so they take go to Davos

1981
02:44:18,400 --> 02:44:21,840
that's where they hand him the bag full of money you can stick it in one of the

1982
02:44:21,840 --> 02:44:25,160
private banks there and it's there now for the rest of his life that most is

1983
02:44:25,160 --> 02:44:30,520
where Tim Geithner gets the you know that 20 or 30 million dollars just

1984
02:44:30,520 --> 02:44:34,440
hand it to him in in precious metals or diamonds or cash and he stores it away

1985
02:44:34,440 --> 02:44:37,880
that's what they do in Davos that's what is there for that's what a new world

1986
02:44:37,880 --> 02:44:42,480
order gets paid today is payday for the new world order in Davos Switzerland

1987
02:44:42,480 --> 02:44:46,440
they worked all year they get their bonuses they get them today in Davos

1988
02:44:46,440 --> 02:44:51,120
this week in Davos Buffett gets his big satchel of cash Geithner gets his

1989
02:44:51,120 --> 02:44:55,360
satchel of cash everyone gets paid this week in Davos so let the party you know

1990
02:44:55,360 --> 02:45:00,360
let the parties flow I want to shift gears again ladies and gentlemen we're

1991
02:45:00,360 --> 02:45:03,440
obviously going to go into overdrive we're showing pictures here a live feed

1992
02:45:03,440 --> 02:45:06,840
from a helicopter that CNN says you're not allowed to see so we've entered a

1993
02:45:06,840 --> 02:45:13,640
new Orwellian level here where CNN and other cable news channels are saying

1994
02:45:13,640 --> 02:45:18,960
they're not going to show live feeds we have the KHOU feeds you can see it they

1995
02:45:18,960 --> 02:45:23,600
must have huge servers as this is being watched all over the country we have the

1996
02:45:23,600 --> 02:45:29,360
KHOU feed posted at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com right now but CIA

1997
02:45:29,360 --> 02:45:35,520
operative takes responsibility for Algerian gas plant attack in the video

1998
02:45:35,520 --> 02:45:41,600
Mo Qatar Bell Mo Qatar said to be the mastermind behind the terrorist attack

1999
02:45:41,600 --> 02:45:48,800
by the Islamic al Mujahideen brigade in the gas complex in Algeria takes credit

2000
02:45:48,800 --> 02:45:52,760
for the operation now let me show in the document cam viewers this a radio

2001
02:45:52,760 --> 02:45:55,880
listener should go to infowars.com this is confirming what the London

2002
02:45:55,880 --> 02:46:00,240
Independent was saying terror in northern Africa are Westerners pulling

2003
02:46:00,240 --> 02:46:06,280
the strings and it has the it has the Prime Minister Sayal telling reporters

2004
02:46:06,280 --> 02:46:11,440
that it's an English accent groups leading the Al Qaeda forces well we know

2005
02:46:11,440 --> 02:46:14,800
Al Qaeda works for the West they've given them Libya in Syria they've now

2006
02:46:14,800 --> 02:46:20,320
taken over Libya they're deploying into other areas and then using this as an

2007
02:46:20,320 --> 02:46:27,080
excuse for NATO through Afrikan to invade and and run raids into these

2008
02:46:27,080 --> 02:46:33,120
areas just absolutely amazing and US begins transporting French troops and

2009
02:46:33,120 --> 02:46:37,880
equipment into Mali with another staged event as a pretext I mean how unveiled

2010
02:46:37,880 --> 02:46:42,600
does this have to get where the West publicly runs Al Qaeda I mean does that

2011
02:46:42,600 --> 02:46:46,320
not add massive credibility to everybody that pointed out that government was

2012
02:46:46,320 --> 02:46:53,680
involved in 9-11 well Tony Blair you know he gave him credit for setting up

2013
02:46:53,680 --> 02:47:00,600
the collapse of Libya his relationship with Gaddafi he had him profited

2014
02:47:00,600 --> 02:47:06,480
handsomely from that he's a Davos guy Davos man Tony Blair he's cutting deals

2015
02:47:06,480 --> 02:47:11,800
all over the world and of course Mali is the the the collateral damage of Libya

2016
02:47:11,800 --> 02:47:15,040
because all those weapons suddenly found their way onto the street and into

2017
02:47:15,040 --> 02:47:18,800
Algeria and into Mali and so that there's a whole what they call the

2018
02:47:18,800 --> 02:47:26,560
Maghreb the North African region is now become you know controlled by those

2019
02:47:26,560 --> 02:47:33,520
folks that are at war with the banksters the Western interests that have been you

2020
02:47:33,520 --> 02:47:38,520
know screwing with them for a number of decades and the response from the US and

2021
02:47:38,520 --> 02:47:43,160
Britain seems to be completely wrong-headed they they don't understand

2022
02:47:43,160 --> 02:47:46,440
what the why the problem started they don't understand why the problem

2023
02:47:46,440 --> 02:47:49,440
continues and they have no idea how to end the problem so they're just going to

2024
02:47:49,440 --> 02:47:56,680
continue to foster continuation and spread of enemies you know when they go

2025
02:47:56,680 --> 02:48:01,480
they send drones into Pakistan or these places and just murder people

2026
02:48:01,480 --> 02:48:04,760
indiscriminately they're breeding problems and of course they don't have

2027
02:48:04,760 --> 02:48:07,440
the money to pay for all this so I have to borrow more money who are they

2028
02:48:07,440 --> 02:48:12,520
borrowing it from China China's now war with Japan who's who's allied with the

2029
02:48:12,520 --> 02:48:16,240
US so we're in World War three right now it's being fought in the currency pits

2030
02:48:16,240 --> 02:48:20,280
it's a currency war and it brings us back to the fundamental reality that

2031
02:48:20,280 --> 02:48:23,520
countries like Germany aren't repatriating their gold the Netherlands

2032
02:48:23,520 --> 02:48:27,000
is repatriating their gold because they don't trust that's anymore they want out

2033
02:48:27,000 --> 02:48:31,000
of Dodge they want their gold and they don't want to play this game anymore and

2034
02:48:31,000 --> 02:48:35,080
that's why gold is going to go to ten thousand dollars an ounce because the

2035
02:48:35,080 --> 02:48:39,640
gold is not in these walls to spend sold already to pay for these stupid

2036
02:48:39,640 --> 02:48:43,200
ridiculous how are they going to cover it now that these countries are all

2037
02:48:43,200 --> 02:48:46,440
demanding their gold out of the private Federal Reserve Geithner's over there

2038
02:48:46,440 --> 02:48:50,920
you know hanging out at Davos the public Bilderberg meeting I mean it's just

2039
02:48:50,920 --> 02:48:54,160
their craziness they're gonna cut them a check they're gonna cut them a check and

2040
02:48:54,160 --> 02:48:58,640
say okay you we owe you thirty billion dollars in gold here's a check for thirty

2041
02:48:58,640 --> 02:49:01,840
billion dollars and these countries will say wait a minute we want the gold and

2042
02:49:01,840 --> 02:49:06,040
they'll say sorry we don't have it the here's the check it you know sorry it's

2043
02:49:06,040 --> 02:49:09,800
tough luck and that's when they're going to that's when that's when all hell's

2044
02:49:09,800 --> 02:49:12,840
gonna break loose because then you're gonna realize that the gold has been

2045
02:49:12,840 --> 02:49:17,680
sold it's not there and you've got this reporter real fast talking to the police

2046
02:49:17,680 --> 02:49:22,240
she's getting the statements kind of find out what the latest and greatest

2047
02:49:22,240 --> 02:49:31,800
information may be as far as information we are going to bring that update to you

2048
02:49:31,800 --> 02:49:36,680
but just to sort of recap what we believe we do know at this point is the

2049
02:49:36,680 --> 02:49:40,840
before she was pulled away to get the latest information I did learn that the

2050
02:49:40,840 --> 02:49:45,280
person that they do have in custody they are unsure if that person is actually a

2051
02:49:45,280 --> 02:49:49,520
shooter or is actually a person who may have been involved in the altercation

2052
02:49:49,520 --> 02:49:53,600
that led to all of this at this point if this isn't stage you watch it's gonna be

2053
02:49:53,600 --> 02:49:58,400
gang related the ability of trying to get some of because 77% of the shootings

2054
02:49:58,400 --> 02:50:01,680
that call mass shootings are gang related which is still bad but it's to

2055
02:50:01,680 --> 02:50:05,600
adult shooting each other you know over the gangster culture that's so popular

2056
02:50:05,600 --> 02:50:11,960
also pushed I tell you max Kaiser is our guest this is just amazing max Kaiser

2057
02:50:11,960 --> 02:50:15,480
calm max we're gonna do a little bit of overdrive if you can do it because I've

2058
02:50:15,480 --> 02:50:19,080
been cutting you short here and I got so many questions when we come back what

2059
02:50:19,080 --> 02:50:23,480
will it look like as the countries say give us our money they say no that's

2060
02:50:23,480 --> 02:50:28,720
already happening what will that do will that create even more uncertainty with

2061
02:50:28,720 --> 02:50:32,720
the IO use and how long can the globalist pay off the Chinese the

2062
02:50:32,720 --> 02:50:36,640
Germans and others with bags of cash that is being devalued and what happens

2063
02:50:36,640 --> 02:50:41,440
once the dollar does lose its status I mean what type of bonker insanity these

2064
02:50:41,440 --> 02:50:46,040
dollars have been buying everybody off so far by the globalist I guess the

2065
02:50:46,040 --> 02:50:48,280
globalist will just move to another country and we'll get the blame for it I

2066
02:50:48,280 --> 02:50:51,360
think that's the answer but we're gonna find out you know there's max Kaiser

2067
02:50:51,360 --> 02:50:54,960
gonna be right in April or within a few months of that is it going to be the

2068
02:50:54,960 --> 02:50:59,120
next level of collapse and what will that signify I'm Alex Jones and this is

2069
02:50:59,120 --> 02:51:04,360
the end fall war if you've ever wanted one of our best-selling generators but

2070
02:51:04,360 --> 02:51:08,280
we're waiting for an offer so crazy you couldn't refuse then you're not gonna

2071
02:51:08,280 --> 02:51:12,240
want to miss this exciting message here's why our solar generators provide

2072
02:51:12,240 --> 02:51:16,840
life-saving electrical power and unlike gas generators solar generators run

2073
02:51:16,840 --> 02:51:21,280
quietly emit no fumes and produce electricity from the Sun so when the

2074
02:51:21,280 --> 02:51:25,360
lights go out you'll always have the power you need now here's the best part

2075
02:51:25,360 --> 02:51:30,080
every year we accumulate a few solar generators that we just can't sell as

2076
02:51:30,080 --> 02:51:35,160
new we put them in a special spot in our warehouse and we discount them heavily

2077
02:51:35,160 --> 02:51:38,960
at the end of each year we call them scratch and dead units but they're

2078
02:51:38,960 --> 02:51:42,920
really just like new each unit comes with a full factory warranty and

2079
02:51:42,920 --> 02:51:47,840
special bonuses you just won't believe don't wait they go fast go to scratch

02:54:17,480 --> 02:54:25,120
snow globe and when we shake it up was our Christmas present it's totally and

2111
02:54:25,120 --> 02:54:31,200

02:54:31,200 --> 02:54:36,840
there's bacteria or sewage in it let me let me shake this up for everybody and

present it turned out even better than we thought it came in the official

2115
02:54:46,520 --> 02:54:51,160
packaging and everything probably made in China and probably has like fetid

2116
02:54:51,160 --> 02:54:55,680
urine in it or something I don't know but there you go going back to Max

2117
02:54:55,680 --> 02:54:59,920
Kaiser of max Kaiser calm you can follow us on Twitter at real Alex Jones and

2118
02:54:59,920 --> 02:55:05,360
where is the best Twitter for you max there's several big ones out there well

2119
02:55:05,360 --> 02:55:10,680
just max Kaiser so it's Twitter forward slash max Kaiser okay you heard my

2120
02:55:10,680 --> 02:55:14,400
long-winded question before the break what is that what is the next stage of

2121
02:55:14,400 --> 02:55:18,800
collapse look like and what will happen well I'm just reading zero hedge they

2122
02:55:18,800 --> 02:55:22,760
got a story up right now Mervyn King Bank of England is talking about

2123
02:55:22,760 --> 02:55:30,080
rebalancing to avoid a currency war and that's that's a big that's it that's a

2124
02:55:30,080 --> 02:55:34,960
big moment because he acknowledges that we're in a currency war the UK pound is

2125
02:55:34,960 --> 02:55:38,760
gonna have to be revalued down sharply that means purchasing power in the UK

2126
02:55:38,760 --> 02:55:42,680
is going to collapse as you know I moved to London from Paris to observe and to

2127
02:55:42,680 --> 02:55:46,800
report on the collapse of the UK pound in the UK economy because it's one of

2128
02:55:46,800 --> 02:55:50,120
the most vulnerable economies in the world because they have so little gold

2129
02:55:50,120 --> 02:55:56,080
after Gordon Brown sold most of it back in 2001 so this is another shoe to drop

2130
02:55:56,080 --> 02:56:02,400
this is another chapter in the collapse of these paper money empires and of

2131
02:56:02,400 --> 02:56:06,760
course gold and silver are acting fantastically well so far this year and

2132
02:56:06,760 --> 02:56:11,160
it's just playing out exactly as we said it would over the past couple years and

2133
02:56:11,160 --> 02:56:15,960
2013 looks to be a continuation so looking into your crystal ball things

2134
02:56:15,960 --> 02:56:25,960
are right on schedule pretty much I say that the economy that growth needed to

2135
02:56:25,960 --> 02:56:33,800
pay the debt is a quantity that will never come to pass and I'll give you a

2136
02:56:33,800 --> 02:56:38,760
good example of how to determine that the the amount of debt in the world or

2137
02:56:38,760 --> 02:56:43,720
even in the u.s. with with its many many trillions of dollars of debt but to pay

2138
02:56:43,720 --> 02:56:50,080
that debt off it would of course be a subset of the tax being collected on

2139
02:56:50,080 --> 02:56:55,400
growth okay so how much tax and how much growth would be required to pay the debt

2140
02:56:55,400 --> 02:57:01,600
well all growth in the modern economy is tied to oil and if you were to burn a

2141
02:57:01,600 --> 02:57:06,080
trillion barrels of oil the approximately the same amount of barrels

2142
02:57:06,080 --> 02:57:10,560
of oil that have been burned so far in the last 100 years if you were to burn

2143
02:57:10,560 --> 02:57:14,880
another trillion barrels of oil you would not generate enough taxable income

2144
02:57:14,880 --> 02:57:20,080
to pay off the current debt doesn't give you an idea of how much debt there is so

2145
02:57:20,080 --> 02:57:25,080
in other words this debt is never going to be paid off jobs are never coming

2146
02:57:25,080 --> 02:57:31,200
back wages will continue to crash and the bond market collapse is coming and

2147
02:57:31,200 --> 02:57:35,240
gold and silver are gonna go a lot higher that there's just there's just no

2148
02:57:35,240 --> 02:57:41,040
way around it max we're in a little bit of overdrive here when we come back but

2149
02:57:41,040 --> 02:57:45,000
you know all I can say is this you look at how they've tried to destroy women

2150
02:57:45,000 --> 02:57:50,680
destroy the family how MTV has pushed gangster and jackass cultures on people

2151
02:57:50,680 --> 02:57:55,320
how it's been sold that men are supposed to be weak and stupid or thug like I

2152
02:57:55,320 --> 02:57:59,480
mean why would the system try to degenerate society I guess for the

2153
02:57:59,480 --> 02:58:03,680
casino gulag model that you talked about and it's all happening you said a moment

2154
02:58:03,680 --> 02:58:08,720
ago you talked about what's the endgame for the the elites I mean look what Glenn

2155
02:58:08,720 --> 02:58:12,600
Beck is doing he's trying to create it he's got two billion dollars he wants to

2156
02:58:12,600 --> 02:58:18,000
create his own village his own society down there in Texas the Koch brothers are

2157
02:58:18,000 --> 02:58:22,760
want to buy an island in Detroit and create their own you know their own

2158
02:58:22,760 --> 02:58:28,240
society you've got two or three examples now of these elites wanting to build

2159
02:58:28,240 --> 02:58:34,840
their own castles their own neo-feudal like it like they said that's the model

2160
02:58:34,840 --> 02:58:38,640
and then they're gonna call it libertarian globalism collapses things

2161
02:58:38,640 --> 02:58:42,840
then they exempt themselves from libertarian stay there we're gonna we're

2162
02:58:42,840 --> 02:58:50,640

entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse the globalist model is

2165
02:59:00,760 --> 02:59:05,800
to shut down societies and starve Patriots out until they acquiesce to the

2166
02:59:05,800 --> 02:59:09,080

Broadcasting Network

2178
03:00:05,520 --> 03:00:13,040
big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does

2179
03:00:13,040 --> 03:00:20,680
he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas

2180
03:00:20,680 --> 03:00:26,360
Alex Jones you see the globalist have exempted themselves from all the laws

2181
03:00:26,360 --> 03:00:31,400
regulations and rules that they've created and pushed so that only they can

2182
03:00:31,400 --> 03:00:35,280
operate and so they're gonna have city-states that are outside of the law

2183
03:00:35,280 --> 03:00:40,040
and given special licensure by the power structure so the elites can live in those

2184
03:00:40,040 --> 03:00:44,480
they're then gonna get the scared middle-class to pay exorbitant prices to

2185
03:00:44,480 --> 03:00:48,560
live within the castle walls and we actually covered that in a bunch of

2186
03:00:48,560 --> 03:00:53,400
recent reports we did last year breaking that down and again after they collapse

2187
03:00:53,400 --> 03:00:58,360
and suck everything together then like this big Bilderberg group member has

2188
03:00:58,360 --> 03:01:02,000
talked about the floating cities and all the rest of it then I'm gonna do a

2189
03:01:02,000 --> 03:01:06,160
special report on this then they exempt themselves and you've got to go live in

2190
03:01:06,160 --> 03:01:10,640
their system if you have any money I mean it they figured it all out that's

2191
03:01:10,640 --> 03:01:14,000
why they're getting rid of nation states with a global crime syndicate above it

2192
03:01:14,000 --> 03:01:17,680
who then will get their own private zones where they can operate however

2193
03:01:17,680 --> 03:01:21,560
they want and yeah can you imagine it's like zeitgeist living in Glenn Beck's

2194
03:01:21,560 --> 03:01:26,680
two billion dollar libertarian heaven in Texas and I knew they were looking at

2195
03:01:26,680 --> 03:01:29,720
stuff outside Austin I talked about the time to Glenn Beck was moving to Texas

2196
03:01:29,720 --> 03:01:33,800
before he did I said it could be Austin because they were looking at properties

2197
03:01:33,800 --> 03:01:37,960
here and I just hope he doesn't move and set up a bit I mean whatever it's a free

2198
03:01:37,960 --> 03:01:42,920
country I guess he can set up is is his utopia here I know I'm not gonna be

2199
03:01:42,920 --> 03:01:45,840
living in it but see if you're an insider you're gonna be able to get

2200
03:01:45,840 --> 03:01:50,440
deals as a stakeholder under general 21 to have lesser taxes to generate its own

2201
03:01:50,440 --> 03:01:55,320
power its own food so you live in kind of like the Glenn Beck gulag man I tell

2202
03:01:55,320 --> 03:01:59,960
you they've really thought all this out Max Kaiser I think you're gonna see one

2203
03:01:59,960 --> 03:02:03,440
of these whether it's the Koch brothers or Glenn Beck I think it's gonna be

2204
03:02:03,440 --> 03:02:08,840
another situation like the Hale-Bopp Comet cult or the Jim Jones

2205
03:02:08,840 --> 03:02:15,760
Yana cult they become very insular after 10 years people start going mad and then

2206
03:02:15,760 --> 03:02:19,240
there's mass suicide I mean that's where Glenn Beck is going we're gonna read

2207
03:02:19,240 --> 03:02:24,000
about him in 10 years as the guy who convinced you know a 2,000 people to

2208
03:02:24,000 --> 03:02:28,960
drink the Kool-Aid and commit suicide chasing his idea of whatever he's

2209
03:02:28,960 --> 03:02:32,720
mumbling on about because when you secede from society and you set yourself

2210
03:02:32,720 --> 03:02:40,720
up as in some way living according to an ethos that is completely divorced from

2211
03:02:40,720 --> 03:02:46,280
anything that we know and appreciate as a democratic system let's call it or an

2212
03:02:46,280 --> 03:02:53,840
American system or an egalitarian system you become prone to ego maniacal

2213
03:02:53,840 --> 03:02:59,960
dictator like psychopaths like Glenn Beck who rise up and realize that the

2214
03:02:59,960 --> 03:03:04,440
only way that he can escape facing the reality of his own shortcomings is to

2215
03:03:04,440 --> 03:03:08,200
convince everyone and himself to kill themselves and that's where he's headed

2216
03:03:08,200 --> 03:03:13,440
well I'm a January said it it's headed to sell real estate plan you know what's

2217
03:03:13,440 --> 03:03:17,600
incredible I was actually approached and I think oh my gosh I just remembered I

2218
03:03:17,600 --> 03:03:22,920
was approached by a bit successful businessman in Dallas about a month ago

2219
03:03:22,920 --> 03:03:27,520
actually for this plan I think Beck must have I know he was talking to Beck and

2220
03:03:27,520 --> 03:03:31,840
Beck I even know where it is oh my gosh see I don't even know about this you're

2221
03:03:31,840 --> 03:03:34,840
sort of talking about I've been out of town for three days four days I went and

2222
03:03:34,840 --> 03:03:39,040
looked it up and sure enough he's announcing it he's not saying where I

2223
03:03:39,040 --> 03:03:44,760
know where the idea came from oh my gosh I can't believe it it's a it's a it's a

2224
03:03:44,760 --> 03:03:50,400
shopping mall that's gone bankrupt outside Dallas that's breaking news

2225
03:03:50,400 --> 03:03:55,480
right there at least I know Beck is is looking at it oh my gosh can you imagine

2226
03:03:55,480 --> 03:04:00,320
going and living in a shut down shopping mall that has shops that then they're

2227
03:04:00,320 --> 03:04:03,920
gonna have stuff built around it where everybody moves which wouldn't be a bad

2228
03:04:03,920 --> 03:04:08,280
idea if it was his own incorporated city and I guess that's the plan wow I know

2229
03:04:08,280 --> 03:04:11,840
Glenn Beck's plan unless I'm wrong because I was called by a another

2230
03:04:11,840 --> 03:04:15,800
businessman who I know in the DFW area and he was telling me he was getting

2231
03:04:15,800 --> 03:04:19,760
together with other talk show host and then he'd recently met with Glenn Beck

2232
03:04:19,760 --> 03:04:26,600
well I understand that he's raised two billion dollars for this project so it

2233
03:04:26,600 --> 03:04:31,520
yeah it's a very well-funded real estate project they're going to live a

2234
03:04:31,520 --> 03:04:36,320
libertarian dream and as you as we were saying there's libertarianism and

2235
03:04:36,320 --> 03:04:41,520
there's fake libertarianism more segment can you do it yeah whatever man yeah

2236
03:04:41,520 --> 03:04:47,640
because I want to talk about this Peter Thiel the Bilderberg guy Glenn Beck now

2237
03:04:47,640 --> 03:04:51,240
says he is the leader of the libertarians while Ron Paul supporters

2238
03:04:51,240 --> 03:04:54,800
he said need to have the army used on him so that doesn't sound too libertarian

2239
03:04:54,800 --> 03:04:58,680
to me I will be right back my gosh I am flipping out because I actually know

2240
03:04:58,680 --> 03:05:00,960
about Glenn Beck's operation I forgot about this

2241
03:05:00,960 --> 03:05:07,280

03:08:05,520 --> 03:08:09,920
Jones on the GCN radio network

2280
03:08:09,920 --> 03:08:31,760
well it's a terrible shooting but not as bad as it could have been and as I said

2281
03:08:31,760 --> 03:08:36,720
if it's not staged or some mentally ill Prozac head copycat er I've been saying

2282
03:08:36,720 --> 03:08:40,520
this for over an hour since it broke and then we had no information only because

2283
03:08:40,520 --> 03:08:43,400
it's usually only one of three things it's not hard to make these predictions

2284
03:08:43,400 --> 03:08:48,720
CNN who says they'll decide what we're allowed to see and and would not show

2285
03:08:48,720 --> 03:08:52,880
live feeds of it as we have been doing for TV viewers playing clubs for radio

2286
03:08:52,880 --> 03:08:59,480
listeners two students wounded in Houston College shooting officials not

2287
03:08:59,480 --> 03:09:03,520
servants believe two students were wounded in crossfire as two people shot

2288
03:09:03,520 --> 03:09:08,000
at each other at a Texas Community College Tuesday so gang related folks

2289
03:09:08,000 --> 03:09:12,280
it's gonna nip me because the culture is be a cool gangster you know all these

2290
03:09:12,280 --> 03:09:16,280
rappers and people that end up shooting each other just to prove their men it's

2291
03:09:16,280 --> 03:09:20,620
so horrible and there you go one of the shooters was also injured and is in

2292
03:09:20,620 --> 03:09:25,840
custody in the North Harris campus of Lone Star College spokesman Jed Young

2293
03:09:25,840 --> 03:09:31,280
said the other shooter fled the campus he said the police believe the danger

2294
03:09:31,280 --> 03:09:35,880
has been mitigated so hundreds of police SWAT teams you name it and meanwhile

2295
03:09:35,880 --> 03:09:40,640
listen it's gonna be gang related I mean like I said most what they call mass

2296
03:09:40,640 --> 03:09:46,240
shootings are rival gangs shooting each other at least three shot at Houston

2297
03:09:46,240 --> 03:09:50,280
Area Community College they use the New York numbers so what was it nine people

2298
03:09:50,280 --> 03:09:57,160
shot the shooter shot his estranged boss and then was walking away and the police

2299
03:09:57,160 --> 03:10:01,880
shot a whole bunch of people in New York got nine people and then also some

2300
03:10:01,880 --> 03:10:05,200
repair guy was on the bridge doing repair and they just came up and shot

2301
03:10:05,200 --> 03:10:08,760
him and then another veterans car broke down they just pulled up and shot him

2302
03:10:08,760 --> 03:10:14,080
and they and they count those as the shooting numbers they'll call it a

2303
03:10:14,080 --> 03:10:17,440
criminal event now I mean they count those nine people in mass shooting

2304
03:10:17,440 --> 03:10:24,200
numbers just just incredible yeah at least three shot at Houston Area

2305
03:10:24,200 --> 03:10:27,800
Community College but one of them is the shoe is one of the shooters reportedly

2306
03:10:27,800 --> 03:10:32,200
one of the alleged shooters and two of them are people shot in the crossfire

2307
03:10:32,200 --> 03:10:39,600
thank God it wasn't another goth devil worshipper because you got the gut it's

2308
03:10:39,600 --> 03:10:47,720
always the same goth devil worshipper in psychiatric care seeing psychiatrists

2309
03:10:47,720 --> 03:10:52,240
and psychologists on serotonin reuptake inhibitors

2310
03:10:52,240 --> 03:10:58,040
I mean it's amazing Harrison Kleibel were into devil worship God and I'm not

2311
03:10:58,040 --> 03:11:00,960
bashing folks like to wear black and all that you know there's different groups

2312
03:11:00,960 --> 03:11:05,640
of people like that it's just that that's the mo Wow guaranteed it's gonna

2313
03:11:05,640 --> 03:11:10,000
come out now gang-related and that's terrible news but thank God it's not 30

2314
03:11:10,000 --> 03:11:14,600
dead people because they would really go to town with that and I still believe

2315
03:11:14,600 --> 03:11:17,280
with all the hype we're seeing that they're gonna stay some false flags

2316
03:11:17,280 --> 03:11:20,600
that's why they're so confident max Kaiser thanks for holding into

2317
03:11:20,600 --> 03:11:24,840
overdrive here with us again TV host syndicated radio host max Kaiser max

2318
03:11:24,840 --> 03:11:28,680
Kaiser calm you just tuned in I'm Alex Jones of prison planet calm and prison

2319
03:11:28,680 --> 03:11:34,760
planet TV max for those just joining us I don't want to sit here just for the

2320
03:11:34,760 --> 03:11:38,560
sake of it and bash Glenn Beck and and and you mentioned Glenn Beck says he

2321
03:11:38,560 --> 03:11:43,480
has two billion dollars and is gonna build a libertarian utopia I know he's

2322
03:11:43,480 --> 03:11:48,440
been looking at land outside Austin as I talked to one of the people involved

2323
03:11:48,440 --> 03:11:51,320
let's leave it at that and I was horrified by it then it was actually

2324
03:11:51,320 --> 03:11:57,080
Dallas that he moved to and then I got a call by a nice businessman I know who's

2325
03:11:57,080 --> 03:12:02,280
a patriot and he said that hey you know there's this shopping mall that's

2326
03:12:02,280 --> 03:12:06,880
bankrupt and we can make it all guns Patriots stuff survival stuff and and

2327
03:12:06,880 --> 03:12:10,160
then maybe have a community around that because the worst real estate is is

2328
03:12:10,160 --> 03:12:14,840
North Dallas you know in Texas it's just plunging that's the worst area in Texas

2329
03:12:14,840 --> 03:12:18,360
overall good state and it may not be the same deal by but I know this guy's met

2330
03:12:18,360 --> 03:12:21,240
with Glenn Beck because he told me about that too and I've got a singing

2331
03:12:21,240 --> 03:12:24,080
suspicion that's where he got the idea because Beck doesn't ever have his own

2332
03:12:24,080 --> 03:12:27,080
ideas it's always somebody else's I'm gonna make a phone call after the show

2333
03:12:27,080 --> 03:12:29,680
today but it's the idea of Peter teal the big

2334
03:12:29,680 --> 03:12:36,780
Bilderberg guy teal feel or teal always get it wrong yep say it again

2335
03:12:36,780 --> 03:12:40,080
yeah yeah that Mike's so bad I can't understand a word coming out of it hold

2336
03:12:40,080 --> 03:12:47,840
on feel yeah yeah th yeah the of that Bilderberg guy is the one you know

2337
03:12:47,840 --> 03:12:52,000
pushing this but again they bankrupt things then make themselves exempt from

2338
03:12:52,000 --> 03:12:56,160
the very taxes and then go live in these command bases that's what the globalist

2339
03:12:56,160 --> 03:12:59,960
have said is their model so I guess Glenn Beck's is trying to copy that now

2340
03:12:59,960 --> 03:13:05,120
I've been ranting go ahead Max Keiser well first of all is a carpetbagger who

2341
03:13:05,120 --> 03:13:09,280
wants his Yankee down in Austin Texas I mean don't you Texans have more

2342
03:13:09,280 --> 03:13:13,400
self-respect to this I mean you got to run this guy out of town shouldn't

2343
03:13:13,400 --> 03:13:19,160
there be I mean y'all got the guns y'all got the the manpower why are you letting

2344
03:13:19,160 --> 03:13:23,800
this carpetbagger come down to Austin Texas and set up his libertarian utopian

2345
03:13:23,800 --> 03:13:29,360
paradise which is gonna nothing but a scam media scam in your backyard that's

2346
03:13:29,360 --> 03:13:37,100
an insult Alex I'm just speechless here it's just things are getting so

2347
03:13:37,100 --> 03:13:43,400
just help it's an insult how dare he go move into the Holy Land of Austin Texas

2348
03:13:43,400 --> 03:13:47,440
you know it's not gonna be weird anymore instead of saying keep it weird Austin

2349
03:13:47,440 --> 03:13:51,320
Texas it's gonna be like welcome to Glenn Beckville where everybody is

2350
03:13:51,320 --> 03:13:57,760
boring media Jack idiot you know he's really lowered the value of that town

2351
03:13:57,760 --> 03:14:02,300
tremendously if you let this carpetbagger into town and can't you do

2352
03:14:02,300 --> 03:14:05,760
something you got listeners down there isn't there something you can do Alex we

2353
03:14:05,760 --> 03:14:10,560
need you to stop this from happening well I don't I don't know if he's

2354
03:14:10,560 --> 03:14:14,640
moving to Austin I know he was looking at stuff here and pieces of land and

2355
03:14:14,640 --> 03:14:20,640
stuff all I know is that I found out from people that worked in around him

2356
03:14:20,640 --> 03:14:23,820
that indeed he did focus on everything we did have people watching it and when

2357
03:14:23,820 --> 03:14:28,600
we see he takes what we do and then spins it and then he kind of just walks

2358
03:14:28,600 --> 03:14:32,980
around in these weird you know blue jeans a little nerd outfit all creepy

2359
03:14:32,980 --> 03:14:36,840
and and and and weird and a lot of his followers are good people but a big

2360
03:14:36,840 --> 03:14:41,200
contingent of them are like into the wimpiness and into the whole and then

2361
03:14:41,200 --> 03:14:46,960
he always sabotages libertarians at key points so I feel like he's on my six and

2362
03:14:46,960 --> 03:14:52,360
it just is creepy knowing what I know about him that that he is constantly

2363
03:14:52,360 --> 03:14:59,320
worried about what I'm up to and I just you know his whole career is based on a

2364
03:14:59,320 --> 03:15:04,880
bad imitation of Alex Jones I mean before Glenn Beck came on Fox News I

2365
03:15:04,880 --> 03:15:09,560
mean there was Alex Jones and you know you brought to the to the media and to

2366
03:15:09,560 --> 03:15:13,600
the media world somebody who wore their heart on their sleeve in a very obvious

2367
03:15:13,600 --> 03:15:20,080
way and then Glenn Beck did this on Fox News where he would well up and get very

2368
03:15:20,080 --> 03:15:24,520
emotional over things and he's basically doing an Alex Jones impression so but he

2369
03:15:24,520 --> 03:15:27,880
would not cover the stories that Alex Jones covers because of course he

2370
03:15:27,880 --> 03:15:31,760
doesn't want to upset Fox News and his media masters and he's parlayed that

2371
03:15:31,760 --> 03:15:36,520
into this new two billion dollar fandango down in Austin Texas so what I'm

2372
03:15:36,520 --> 03:15:40,760
hearing he's going to build this utopian version of what I call fake libertarianism

2373
03:15:40,760 --> 03:15:44,440
which means fake libertarianism means he'll say well I'm going to borrow two

2374
03:15:44,440 --> 03:15:48,080
billion dollars at zero percent interest rate and if this works I'm going to keep

2375
03:15:48,080 --> 03:15:51,780
all the profits and if it goes bust then everyone in Texas is going to have to

2376
03:15:51,780 --> 03:15:56,240
absorb the losses and you say well why do you get to borrow two billion dollars

2377
03:15:56,240 --> 03:16:01,000
at 0% they'll say oh I'm a libertarian that's not what libertarianism is.

2378
03:16:01,000 --> 03:16:06,720
He supported the banker bailout. Well yeah that's not libertarianism that's not

2379
03:16:06,720 --> 03:16:12,840
even capitalism that's outright fascism he's a fascist you know he accuses you

2380
03:16:12,840 --> 03:16:17,280
being a fascist and yet he's the guy engaged in a two billion dollar fascist

2381
03:16:17,280 --> 03:16:22,160
enterprise combining the banks with the land speculators in Austin that's

2382
03:16:22,160 --> 03:16:26,520
fascism he's right there in your neighborhood. Well he's looking at Austin

2383
03:16:26,520 --> 03:16:32,400
he's also looking at North the North Dallas suburbs area where it's probably.

2384
03:16:32,400 --> 03:16:37,800
If you were so concerned he should check out Libya or Mali why doesn't Glenn Beck go

2385
03:16:37,800 --> 03:16:42,160
there to build his libertarian paradise that's where it's needed you know if he

2386
03:16:42,160 --> 03:16:46,080
really believes in the in the power of capitalism libertarianism why doesn't he

2387
03:16:46,080 --> 03:16:49,880
go to to Mali and show the people there what Glenn Beck can do. But let's

2388
03:16:49,880 --> 03:16:53,760
elaborate on this let's elaborate on this we've actually done news reports on this

2389
03:16:53,760 --> 03:16:57,080
we cover it in Endgame people think of globalism as getting rid of countries

2390
03:16:57,080 --> 03:17:00,800
they actually break countries into smaller pieces to control them they

2391
03:17:00,800 --> 03:17:04,640
create regions like London or the Vatican that are outside of law and can

2392
03:17:04,640 --> 03:17:09,720
do whatever they want Israel's a similar thing they build their own zones and

2393
03:17:09,720 --> 03:17:14,560
that's what they're actually saying Peter Thiel and others is that they're

2394
03:17:14,560 --> 03:17:19,600
going to establish this it's just amazing that we're actually like you

2395
03:17:19,600 --> 03:17:24,160
said we're going back to feudalism. It is going back to feudalism and I have been

2396
03:17:24,160 --> 03:17:28,380
saying that for a few years neo-feudalism and but this Peter Thiel

2397
03:17:28,380 --> 03:17:32,560
character of course he made his money with PayPal and PayPal of course was

2398
03:17:32,560 --> 03:17:37,600
that along with Visa and MasterCard shutting down WikiLeaks when when it

2399
03:17:37,600 --> 03:17:41,920
became and they also are extra judiciously shutting people down that

2400
03:17:41,920 --> 03:17:47,080
they don't want them to get their views like you know with the with copyright

2401
03:17:47,080 --> 03:17:51,240
and other issues they just shut them down and that's where Peter Thiel

2402
03:17:51,240 --> 03:17:55,320
comes from so he he made his bones engaging with the banksters directly

2403
03:17:55,320 --> 03:17:58,400
through PayPal that's that's where he comes from so now he's going to take

2404
03:17:58,400 --> 03:18:01,560
that experience and he's with the Bilderberg group now he's with these

2405
03:18:01,560 --> 03:18:04,560
folks and they're meeting and they're doing their deals where they're going to

2406
03:18:04,560 --> 03:18:10,080
try to create these little cul-de-sacs these little Disney asks fantasy worlds

2407
03:18:10,080 --> 03:18:15,520
where they're going to be surrounded by an army you've got media ideologues like

2408
03:18:15,520 --> 03:18:19,840
Glenn Beck at the center and within five or six years all the children are gonna

2409
03:18:19,840 --> 03:18:23,440
look like Glenn Beck but they'll all be inbreeding so some will have three arms

2410
03:18:23,440 --> 03:18:27,400
all right that's enough I don't want to get into a Beck bashing fest it's just

2411
03:18:27,400 --> 03:18:32,800
that you know it's just incredible and he is out to get me and you notice I'm

2412
03:18:32,800 --> 03:18:35,560
not out to get Rush Limbaugh I'm not out to get Michael Savage I'm not I don't

2413
03:18:35,560 --> 03:18:42,160
talk about what's the other one's name I don't listen to it what's his name the

2414
03:18:42,160 --> 03:18:48,000
guy on Fox News Sean Hannah Bill O'Reilly yeah what is they're not after

2415
03:18:48,000 --> 03:18:52,880
me so I'm not talking about him it's Glenn Beck is always look how he moved

2416
03:18:52,880 --> 03:18:57,800
up the road from me I mean it's like Sam I mean I need to get this guy out of my

2417
03:18:57,800 --> 03:19:03,520
life he's super creepy well he's a stalker he's talking you so I mean you

2418
03:19:03,520 --> 03:19:08,280
know you've got to deal with it in some way you just got to be enough people in

2419
03:19:08,280 --> 03:19:12,200
Austin that support Alex Jones to do whatever it needs to be done to keep

2420
03:19:12,200 --> 03:19:16,480
Glenn Beck out oh stop it he'll take that just a serious thing no no if he

2421
03:19:16,480 --> 03:19:19,400
wants to buy property and do something to become a libertarian that's great in

2422
03:19:19,400 --> 03:19:23,040
fact I want to think that he's becoming a better guy the problem is he's still

2423
03:19:23,040 --> 03:19:27,120
you know really making stuff up about us I mean I'm not a fascist folks I'm a

2424
03:19:27,120 --> 03:19:31,400
wild liberal in the Thomas Jefferson vein none of these names mean anything

2425
03:19:31,400 --> 03:19:34,880
I'm called a right-winger today because I oppose Obama I am a true

2426
03:19:34,880 --> 03:19:38,920
constitutionalist max I'd like to believe you're the same thing I mean a classical

2427
