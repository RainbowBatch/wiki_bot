1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:36,320
he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.

3
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:45,960
Ladies and gentlemen, it is the 14th day of January, 2013. We're gonna be here live, Lord

4
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:51,420
willing, for the next three hours. And again, I am your host, Alex Jones. We do not have

5
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,840
any guests today except for the Obama phone lady.

6
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,000
And she is going to be in studio with us. She is here in Austin, Texas. If you go up

7
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,240
to infowars.com or prisonplanet.com, you can see there that it says, Obama phone lady comes

8
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:15,240
to Texas. And this is amazing because she's one of the most virally viewed and downloaded

9
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,320
videos ever.

10
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,080
And it's not just that what she's saying is ridiculous about free handouts from the government.

11
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:29,120
I know she's listening right now, she's a very sweet lady. It's that she's very funny.

12
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:34,040
And she's exactly what I thought she would be like when she flew in last night at about

13
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,040
630.

14
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,760
Her plane was late, flew in out of Cleveland via Houston and then to Austin, Texas. And

15
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:48,640
her husband is exactly what I imagined him to be like. Just really nice, funny, smart

16
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:58,280
people except childlike when it comes to trusting government. And she's just as funny and just

17
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:04,120
as charming in person as she is in that video.

18
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:11,920
That's only about a minute long, where she talks about you on social security, food stamps,

19
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:17,700
you get Obama phone. Everybody in Cleveland got Obama phone. Well, ladies and gentlemen,

20
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,560
we took her and her husband out to dinner last night and has had a great evening with

21
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,760
them.

22
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,080
And quite frankly, I haven't really hardly seen my children the last few days. I've been

23
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,200
drinking so much over the weekend. And I wanna go home and see them tonight. But I also wanna

24
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,240
take Obama phone lady out to dinner. You know what I'll do? I'll have my wife come meet

25
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,880
us for dinner.

26
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:44,400
And we'll take Obama phone lady and her husband. And we're gonna tell you her name and everything

27
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,480
here on air. In fact, if you don't know who Obama phone lady is, let's go ahead and cue

28
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,640
that up with audio. Can we cue that up and play the audio here in a moment?

29
00:02:51,640 --> 00:03:17,440
So, people are asking, why have you gotten Obama phone lady here? Well, number one, I

30
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:25,040
said to listeners, there'd be a $5,000 bounty for whoever got me a hold of her. That's some

31
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:30,320
good English there, that there would be a $5,000 bonus for whoever got us in touch with

32
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,320
her.

33
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:40,400
And then if we actually got her on air, $5,000 bounty. And I gotta talk to the guys that

34
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,720
actually ran into her at a store and did this and obviously asked them if they want any

35
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:54,080
of that bounty to go to her. But we flew her down here and she is here. And so in about

36
00:03:54,080 --> 00:04:00,720
an hour and a half from now, if we cover news and take your calls, we will have Obama phone

37
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,720
lady here.

38
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:06,360
And you notice last night when I picked her up, the video is up on infowars.com that I

39
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:12,460
wore a sports jacket. And you notice I'm wearing one now because I've got butterflies. This

40
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:18,640
is a big deal around here and I'm not joking. It's like the eagle has landed, okay? This

41
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,920
is the kind of stuff we get excited about.

42
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:25,960
I was not even excited about going on Piers Morgan, didn't even have butterflies. I didn't

43
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:30,380
wear a sports jacket. For Obama phone lady, I think I'll go put a tie on. I ought to put

44
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:34,720
some diamond cufflinks on. In fact, I'm wearing a short sleeve shirt, that's not respectful

45
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,600
enough. That's actually all I had back there in my wardrobe, I sent stuff away to be cleaned.

46
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:46,920
Anyway, she's coming. You may even get her husband in here with her. He's a character

47
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:52,640
too, but it's a big deal. And I'm telling you, this woman could be ready for standup

48
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:58,160
comedy on HBO right now. So who wants to manage her out there is the big question. We'll be

49
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,040
right back, ladies and gentlemen. Stay with us.

50
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:07,000
Millions of people are going to get sick this winter from colds, flu and other illnesses.

There's an old saying in Tennessee, I know it's in Texas probably in Tennessee that says

81
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:17,440
fool me once, shame on you. If you fool me you can't get fooled again.

82
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:23,920
He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side. You're listening

83
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,920
to Alex Jones.

84
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:43,640
A man's got to have a code, a creed to live by, John Wayne. And I tip my hat and take

85
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:51,040
a toast of coffee to John Wayne from my John Wayne coffee cup that I bought at his favorite

86
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:57,280
place in the world, Monument Valley, Utah, where he shot so many of his first westerns.

87
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:06,120
Mm, absolutely delicious. Thank you so much for joining us on this Monday edition worldwide

88
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,760
broadcast the 14th day of January 2013.

89
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:19,960
Wow, where to begin? Where to start? If you just tuned in to the broadcast, coming up

90
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:27,160
in the flesh and I'm still pinching myself that this isn't a dream. People on the YouTube

91
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:33,080
video that we posted late last night that Rob Dew and John Bowne did a great job getting

92
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:36,560
up even though he didn't get back from dinner with Obama phone lady till about 930.

93
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,160
They stayed up late to edit down our picking her up at the airport and taking her out to

94
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:47,640
dinner and some of the enjoyable antics that took place there. Don't worry, they'll be

95
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:52,600
full behind the scenes videos in the days to come and she's gonna be in studio today

96
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,400
with us on the radio show.

97
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:59,240
And then I think I'm gonna take her out around Austin today as well and shoot some more footage

98
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:05,400
weather. And a lot of people are obviously freaking out saying it's like reality is folding

99
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:12,960
in on itself. She goes out and talks about Obama gave us a phone, he's gonna do more.

100
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:19,240
Everybody in Cleveland got Obama phone. And it's not just that the video is obviously

101
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:24,840
ridiculous, the dependency and the idea that government's there to give us freebies.

102
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:34,220
But that she does have an electric personality. And I think this could be a story of somebody

103
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:39,480
who literally takes that flash in the pan 15 minutes of fame and turns it into something

104
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:46,760
bigger. I see her as a kind of a Sam Kennison style comic, because she's very funny in person,

105
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:52,560
very witty. But again, also tough love here, I told her this last night.

106
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,300
She's like, well, my son says you're a Republican, you're a big conservative, you're pro gun

107
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:01,240
and stuff. I don't really have the Internet, so I don't know. And I came anyways cuz so

108
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:05,680
many people after they heard I was coming on or was thinking about coming on said, yeah,

109
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,080
you gotta go on the Alex Jones show in her community.

110
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:13,680
And a lot of folks she knows said that I was a good guy. And I was honest with her. I said,

111
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:18,560
look, it's ridiculous that you want a free phone from the president and that that's your

112
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:25,360
idea of winning somehow when they take your whole future away with dependency and then

113
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:32,120
basically give us baubles. It's like a free toy and a happy meal.

114
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:40,680
But the fact from a sociological perspective, or a psychological perspective, as a sociologist

115
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:50,240
or as someone studying culture, that she is kind of the archetypal person who really thinks

116
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:55,680
the government cares about her and wants to help her get a leg up. There have been some

117
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,060
people in government that have tried to help folks.

118
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:03,160
There have been good people that have worked through government to help people. But the

119
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:11,040
controlling driving force of government is domestication, enslavement, and cultural destruction.

120
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,720
And no one can argue with the numbers of what welfare and big government has done, not just

121
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:22,200
to the black community, but communities across the board. And so it is my hope, and I'll

122
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:28,880
just be honest with you here about this, is that it is my hope to stay in contact with

123
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:34,620
Obama phone lady, and we'll give you her full name and stuff on air when she joins us.

124
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:40,340
And to try to basically maybe even have her as an auxiliary reporter. I haven't even told

125
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:49,840
her this yet, I'm just saying it all on air. And to try to educate her and inform her about

126
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:55,760
how we're all being inserted into a matrix like prison. So I wanna reach down to the

127
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,440
matrix like Morpheus to her a Neo.

128
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,880
Because as Eric Blair, aka George Arwell said, if there is any hope, will you guys print

129
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:11,460
me Orwell quotes, I meant to do that. Orwell quotes on the only hope lies with the proles.

130
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:15,280
And even though I don't subscribe to the communist ideology, the globalists are using communism

131
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:21,000
as a template of control. And it's the general public, George Arwell talked about, he actually

132
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,640
wrote nonfiction books on this subject, that obsess over lottery tickets or get rich quick

133
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,560
schemes or a hope and a prayer.

134
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:34,280
But just if Obama gets in there, he's gonna fix everything cuz the President can get it

135
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:38,680
done. And this woman really hopes that he's gonna turn the economy around. This woman

136
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:46,680
works for $8 an hour and can't live on that and I don't blame her in Cleveland. She goes

137
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:53,020
and cleans houses all day for $8 an hour, no one could live on that.

138
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:58,160
And they take taxes out of it, and she didn't even understand that. She didn't even understand

139
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:03,040
why her paycheck's getting smaller with the payroll taxes. I mean, let me tell you something,

140
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,720
my wife and other people in my family when they heard that she was coming to town last

141
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,260
week, they said, listen, Alex, you're mean, you don't get her on your show and make fun

142
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,260
of her.

143
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:15,760
And I said, what do you think, I'm an idiot? I don't wanna make fun of her, sure, it's

144
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:24,240
funny at one level, and she knows it's funny. My goal is to actually show this lady who's

145
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,080
actually an interesting human being and has a lot of spirit, a lot of heart, a lot of

146
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,600
guts, who's got real potential.

147
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,120
I guarantee you, ladies and gentlemen, you take somebody like that lady and you put her

148
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:42,400
on the frontier, you put her in adversity. You give her real opportunities to have a

149
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:46,640
future and to build a better world and to not be dumbed down by the television in this

150
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:54,400
sick culture, she would be an unbelievably powerful individual. I can see the potential

151
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,400
there.

152
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:59,800
And that's what makes me so bad about The Collectivist, is that they know human potential

153
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:05,040
and they wanna shutter it, they wanna shut it down. While telling us big government is

154
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:16,200
about getting Obama phone lady to her highest potential. And that is not the case. And if

155
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:22,400
you don't know who Obama phone lady is, can we cue that up one more time?

156
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:26,120
She's the lady who was one of the most viral videos last year. I mean, it's been seen,

157
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:30,160
let's be conservative. There's probably 50 million views in one form or another out there,

158
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,840
8 million here, 5 million there.

159
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:35,960
Keep Obama in president, you know, he gave us a phone.

160
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,960
He gave you a phone.

161
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,960
He's gonna do more.

162
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,960
How did he give you a phone?

163
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:46,640
You sign up and you on full stamps, you on social security, you got low income, you disability.

164
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,640
Okay, what's wrong with Rami again?

165
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,640
Rami, he sucks. Hey.

166
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,640
You got Obama phone?

167
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,640
Yes, everybody in Cleveland, low minority got Obama phone. Keep Obama in president,

168
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,640
you know.

169
00:15:52,640 --> 00:16:08,600
By the way, I put a $5,000 bounty out to find her. And I was surprised, cuz we have listeners

170
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:18,040
in every city. We're on a couple of stations in Ohio, lot of listeners in Cleveland. And

171
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:24,040
no one could find her until a listener ran into her in a store months and months later.

172
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:28,960
And guess what? The Democratic Party took her, same amount of money. She was working,

173
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:35,680
you know, paid canvasser. So we now know that. And they stuck her at a desk job and told

174
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:40,180
her stay out of the public eye. And then they lied to her and said, because you're just

175
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,180
too effective.

176
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:48,320
I mean, see, I'm not gonna lie to this lady. I told her it's hilarious what you did. I

177
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:54,240
don't agree with the dependency. I think if you play your cards right, and if you go to

178
00:16:54,240 --> 00:17:00,200
some small time comedy clubs and get under the right person's wing, you can develop comedy

179
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:06,140
pieces and probably become very famous. She's got natural talent. And there's nothing I'd

180
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,140
like better.

181
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:10,240
By the way, I didn't tell her this to get her here. I told her this once I was with

182
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,600
her in person. But I told her it'll take hard work. She's not gonna go right to the top

183
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:19,360
immediately. She's funny. And my instinct about her, she's exactly what I thought she'd

184
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:28,640
be like. Exactly what I thought she would be like.

185
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:33,560
And her husband was exactly what I thought they'd be like. And just really funny, interesting

186
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:42,080
people who are, again, smart at many levels, but also still buy into the fake dream. And

187
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:48,160
that's what this is all about, the fake dream of, you go to a casino, you're gonna get rich.

188
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,480
You buy a lottery ticket, you're gonna win. You get Obama in, all the problems are gonna

189
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,480
be fixed.

190
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:57,360
And I was sitting there talking to her last night. I know she's listening. I should just

191
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,520
leave it all and let it be fresh when she gets here. She's like, man, I voted for him,

192
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:06,000
voted for him twice. Things gotta get better. Obama's gonna get in trouble. If things don't

193
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,560
get better, honey, things aren't gonna get better.

194
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:15,360
This is Agenda 21 designed to destroy you. They don't bring in 30 million illegal aliens,

195
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,280
so you've got a future. And they don't bring them in so they get a future. They bring them

196
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:28,760
in to drive down the wages and make us poor as a political tool of control. And they also

197
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:33,340
understood that, well, Obama, like Nixon, he can just pump some money out there.

198
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:36,920
They understood Obama's got the printing press to turn up on high. And I said, have you noticed

199
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:42,900
prices have gone up? Notice the packages of potato chips and ice cream have gotten smaller.

200
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:49,600
Have you noticed that in almost every area, things are going up and up and up in price?

201
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,520
And they're like, yeah, we have noticed that. We just can't pay our bills. Her husband works

202
00:18:53,520 --> 00:19:05,080
as a plumber 12 hours a day. She works as a maid for $8 an hour. And again, no one's

203
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,140
ever taught her anything entrepreneurial.

204
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:12,120
No one has explained to her that the maid service she contracts through, I bet money

205
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:18,120
is getting 20, $25 an hour for. And all she's got to do is go hang up signs all around the

206
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:23,660
area that she wants to target, saying she'll come clean houses. And she'd get all that

207
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:28,000
clientele for herself and double or triple her money, just like that with pieces of paper

208
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,120
hung up on the wall.

209
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:34,900
No one is teaching these people anything. They don't teach any of that in school. They

210
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:48,340
don't want you to know that. Anyways, it's going to be a study of can we help somebody?

211
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:53,240
But it's not like the Eddie Murphy movie where they make a bet that they can't help somebody.

212
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:59,400
I know that we can probably try to help this lady and help others by her example. We'll

213
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:03,040
be right back. Stay with us.

214
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:07,900
Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive? From natural disasters

215
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:12,480
like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought, to the family hardships brought on

216
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,420
by a disastrous economy. Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything. At eFoods

217

219
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:31,860
wrote, almost all the grocery stores are closed, but I managed to get my eFoods just in time

220
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:36,620
to be able to help my sister and niece. It is better to be prepared 10 years too early

226
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:13,260
Pastor Ginny and that was the state I was in back in 2010. Then I learned about RNA

227
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:19,520
drops. I learned that 97% of my DNA that scientists have called junk is actually packed with millions

228
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:24,300
of gene switches that play a critical role in controlling how my cells, organs, and other

229
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:28,540
tissues behave. I learned I don't have to put up with disease decay or decline like

230
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:34,240
I've been conditioned to believe. I began taking RNA drops, a 100% natural formula designed

231

259
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:18,420
We're going to get into the news and open the phones up here in a moment. But first,

260
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:27,820
here's from page 60 of 1984 written by George Orwell. If there was hope, it must lie with

261
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:35,460
the proles, that's the common working class. Because only there in those swarming, disregarded

262
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:42,940
masses, 85% of the population of Oceania, that's England and the US, could be forced

263
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:45,700
to destroy the party ever be generated.

264
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:50,500
The party could not be overthrown from within. Its enemies, if ever it had any enemies, had

265
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:55,900
no way of coming together or even of identifying one another. Even if the legendary brotherhood

266
00:24:55,900 --> 00:25:02,020
existed as just a possibility it might, it was inconceivable that its members could ever

267
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:07,080
assemble in large numbers in more than twos and threes.

268
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:14,540
Rebellion meant a look in the eyes, an inflection of the voice, at the most an occasional whispered

269
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:20,300
word. But the proles, if only they could somehow become conscious of their own strength, would

270
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:25,540
have no need to conspire. They need only to rise up and shake themselves like a horse

271
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:28,140
shaking off flies.

272
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:33,580
If they chose, they could blow the party to pieces tomorrow morning. Surely, sooner or

273
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:46,300
later it must come to them to do it, and yet. And he goes through the strength of the proles

274
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:52,900
watching this grandmother out there hand washing the clothes in the slum. And the strength

275
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:58,500
of her sunburned face, and her big muscular shoulders, and sound of children giggling.

276
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:03,900
But the proles wouldn't spend their time studying how government or business worked. The proles

277
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:10,540
obsessed all day about lottery tickets, and lottery systems to win, and get rich schemes,

278
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:20,220
and pornography, and mindlessness, and entertainment put out by the party.

279
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:24,820
Big Brother didn't even need to police the proles. They were just dumbed down, and obsessed

280
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:31,220
with petty garbage, and didn't even exist. The party, the English Socialist Party, which

281
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:35,900
is really a Soviet party in the book. This is what George Arwell, aka real name Eric

282
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:42,940
Blair, who'd worked for the communist, and worked for MI6, and worked for OSS, and worked

283
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,860
as an imperial policeman before that.

284
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:51,340
And lived in the slums on purpose for years, contracting tuberculosis in Paris, and also

285
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:57,940
in London. Wrote a bunch of non-fiction books and essays, amazing stuff. I've read basically

286
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:04,260
all of Arwell's writings I could find in a period in my life when I was about 20. I learned

287
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:09,420
a lot through him not having to actually go live in a slum with people with tuberculosis.

288
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:17,060
He came from a well-to-do kind of establishment intelligentsia family.

289
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:22,100
And he thought communism would fight the ills he saw. And then he discovered, wait a minute,

290
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:26,740
fighting in the Spanish Civil War, that the communists were just as bad as the fascists.

291
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:36,180
They were just criminals, using a governmental term, a political term as a cover. And then

292
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:42,740
he went and worked at the BBC in propaganda. And the character Winston Smith is Eric Blair

293
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:49,620
at the BBC, one of their top propagandists, taking truths and rearranging them and smashing

294
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:50,620
them.

295
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:57,300
And then he discovers the British government is funding Hitler, that they'd funded Hitler.

296
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:02,680
Didn't run Hitler, they helped creating, helped put him in there. It was like a wind-up toy,

297
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:06,160
like one of these mentally ill mass shooters. They give government funds and have a government

298
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:11,020
psychiatrist and then, they go and attack.

299
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:16,660
And the book talks about government-sponsored terror, how the government itself was firing

300
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:23,700
missiles into London every day, randomly, just to scare people. And now everything else

301
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:29,160
was squalor and rack and ruin, but the giant, pyramidal-sized buildings that look like something

302
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:35,180
out of Blade Runner, with black helicopters coming in and out of armored command bases,

303
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:38,340
flying around, looking through your windows and your television screens, watching and

304
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:39,380
listening to you.

305
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:45,780
That is now a reality. They just haven't gone to the physical end of it yet. And here's

306
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:51,360
the good news, they are in check. And if you know chess, that means we've got them, we're

307
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:57,800
closed to fire, we're closed to beat them. Because the average gun shows out there are

308
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:05,620
reporting 10,000 people visiting them, organizers shocked as 10,000 attend gun show.

309
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:13,260
Piers Morgan is now chickened out of a debate he called for, part two, round two. Senator

310
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:17,900
Schumer is saying they'll just use executive power to basically lean on. This is what they've

311
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:21,660
already said they do, that's why we told you this was coming. Executive orders, rule-making,

312
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:27,780
and just tell Walmart and others not to sell semi-autos, and have the ATF come in and make

313
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:31,780
basically nickel and dime them and white glove inspect them till they do it.

314
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:34,620
You're saying, well, how do we have them in check? Doesn't mean we've won, they've still

315
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:39,340
got some moves. But I mean, we're up against them, we're right on their tail. They're not

316
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:43,940
on our tail, we're on their tail. When we come back, I'll explain to you why, go for

317
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:48,500
some news and then take your calls. But coming up at the bottom of the next hour, one hour

318
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:52,180
away, you will be transmitted.

319
00:29:52,180 --> 00:30:02,860
We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

320
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:07,700
Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive? From natural disasters

321
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:12,280
like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought, to the family hardships brought on

322
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:17,240
by a disastrous economy. Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything. At eFoods

323
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:21,460
Direct, we hear from customers every day that are fortunate enough to weather life's storm

324
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:25,980
by having a supply of food on hand. After Hurricane Sandy, Danny from New York City

325
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:31,660
wrote, almost all the grocery stores are closed, but I managed to get my eFoods just in time

326
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:36,420
to be able to help my sister and niece. It is better to be prepared 10 years too early

327
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:41,020
than one day too late. I can warn you, but I can't feed you. Heed the warnings and do

331
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:07,860
Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our

332
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:13,500
immunity and health. At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing

333
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:18,940
a full selection of silver-based products. Our most popular silver-based products are

334
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:24,860
the 32-ounce nano-silver solutions, our 2-ounce nano-silver nasal applicators, as well as

335
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:32,360
our all-natural silver soaps. Just released is our 100% natural silver gel. Our new silver

336
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:37,180
gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and leave the silver

337
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:42,700
at the surface. But rather, we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin-nourishing

338
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:47,780
chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the

339
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:56,180
silver more effectively. Visit www.silverlungs.com and click on our store page to find what silver-based

340
00:31:56,180 --> 00:32:26,060
products are best for you.

341
00:32:56,180 --> 00:33:14,820
In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwanted influence,

342
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:21,100
whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial commons. In Dallas, Texas, three

343
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:26,340
shots were fired at President Kennedy's motorcade in downtown Dallas. One man did it. First

344
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:31,780
reports say that President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by this shooting. It is

345
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:39,980
a big idea. A new world order. I thought that didn't exist. It was almost as if there were

346
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:59,420
planned implosions. It just pancakes. Either you were with us or you were with the terrorists.

347
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:22,100
And later you gave them, time Feinstein loves us. I also believe in a lot of gun owners

348
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:27,740
cut on. Vacationant got all falloc the police and guards. It is an uncomfortable job to

349
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:29,300
for what the central banks do.

350
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:35,500
And for me, give me liberty or give me death.

351
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:40,420
Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.

352
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:49,300
Yes, sir, I am he and it is the 14th day of January 2013.

353
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:55,260
And if you'd like to talk about all the incredible news taking place geopolitically, domestically,

354
00:34:55,260 --> 00:35:02,420
the economy, by the way, start sending your questions in at Real Alex Jones on Twitter.

355
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:08,580
And guys, will you start printing me or ask Christie, who helps run the Twitter account

356
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:10,820
does a great job.

357
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:16,340
Maybe ask her to print off questions for Obama phone lady.

358
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:22,880
Show that when Michelle, that's her first name, so that when Michelle is in here in

359
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:27,660
about an hour from now, we can also have some of your questions for Obama phone lady who

360
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:33,420
we've flown down to Austin, Texas, to really have the archetypal Obama supporter here in

361
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:36,280
studio with us.

362
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:41,860
And by the way, we've had archetypal Bush supporters on before, who thought it was conservative

363
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:45,080
to get rid of the Bill of Rights and were pro torture.

364
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:50,500
So they're just as nonsensical sometimes as well.

365
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:54,460
So we look forward to having her here just because we hope to try to be able to change

366
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,460
her mind.

367
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:58,540
And it doesn't mean we want her to go support Romney.

368
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:02,660
No, Romney sucks to quote Obama phone lady.

369
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,540
The point is, is that it was a rigged game.

370
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:07,300
So that is coming up if you just joined us.

371
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:08,880
Yes, you heard me right.

372
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:16,220
This is not a joke of the video of her arriving to Austin via aircraft is up on prisonplanet.com

373
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:17,220
and infowars.com.

374
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:20,780
In fact, have we tweeted Obama phone lady videos out?

375
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:22,060
I don't think I've even done that.

376
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:24,180
Will you guys tweet that out for me?

377
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:27,940
Cuz it's hard for me to walk and chew gum.

378
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:29,460
I've come here to do two things.

379
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:33,060
One thing is to kick butt and the other thing is to chew bubble gum and I'm all out of bubble

380
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,060
gum.

381
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:36,980
To quote, to paraphrase Rowdy Piper, okay, I'm being silly.

382
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:42,760
The point is, I wanna send out a tweet that Obama phone lady discovered, Obama phone lady's

383
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:45,580
identity discovered.

384
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:47,820
It's kind of dictation, I'm dictating the tweet there.

385
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:51,540
Okay, you can tell I'm excited about this, even though we've got a lot of bad news and

386
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:52,540
some good news here.

387
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:54,100
And we're gonna be going over.

388
00:36:54,100 --> 00:37:00,700
By the way, this shirt sold out, this shirt sold out, but they had a feeling it was gonna

389
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:01,700
sell out.

390
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:07,700
And so there is a truck coming, but tomorrow with more of these.

391
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:10,620
So you'll basically should be able to get it by next week.

392
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:12,420
Get your order in now.

393
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:14,140
We've never had a t-shirt sell like this.

394
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:20,140
It is a come and take it AK-47 with the Texas come and take it, Texas Revolutionary War

395
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:21,140
segment.

396
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:27,220
It says come and take it and inside of the AK-47 is the right to keep and bear arms shall

397
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:30,300
not be infringed.

398
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:35,100
And then it says infoawars.com handsomely on the back.

399
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:40,540
And we've got women asking for a woman's design, that'll take some time, but we got smalls

400
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:41,540
for women.

401
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:45,860
Yes, we're going to come out with some shirts for women, people been, I get requested on

402
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:46,860
the street all the time.

403
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:52,380
I never tell my folks, we gotta come out with women's shirts, and with the same messages,

404
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:55,280
but that are more contour form fitting.

405
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:00,020
My wife has said this, and so we've got to do it.

406
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:02,540
So there I'm multitasking here on air.

407
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:05,780
If you want the come and take it shirt, get your order in now.

408
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:11,100
And of course, we also have the second best selling, Victory or Death with the rattlesnake

409
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,100
on it.

410
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:16,940
Very powerful, we also have a camouflage one of those, not just the black on red one.

411
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:23,860
It's all up at infoawarsstore.com and your purchase of the books, the videos, the T-shirts,

412
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:28,300
all of it makes this broadcast possible.

413
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:33,580
So they're all up there on the site right now, be sure and get it today.

414
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:35,660
And again, continue to spread the word about the transmission.

415
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:40,620
I'm certainly risking my life, my treasure, my name, everything else in this fight.

416
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:43,780
So I'm not saying the least you can do, we appreciate your support.

417
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:47,740
And the point is, this isn't a game, we shouldn't take this platform for granted.

418
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:51,860
That's why I'm working so much harder than I ever have, because we've got to make hay

419
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:52,860
while the sun shines.

420
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:56,420
We've got to engage the globalists while we still have a lot of freedom left.

421
00:38:56,420 --> 00:39:02,900
Now, I told you before we went to break that, people are always saying, you never give the

422
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:03,900
number or the address out.

423
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:06,300
You're right, not everybody's on the internet or wants to order via the internet.

424
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:10,500
You can call and order any T-shirts or propure water filters discounted with promo code WATER

425
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:17,740
ALL of it, 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.

426
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:19,980
And you can also write to us here at P.O.

427
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:23,980
Box 19549, Austin, Texas, 78760, P.O.

428
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:27,780
Box 19549, Austin, Texas, 78760.

429
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:31,660
I give that out so rarely that I don't even have it memorized.

430
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:32,660
So P.O.

431
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:38,180
Box 19549, Austin, Texas, 78760, and we've had that address now for about six years.

432
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:41,460
So that'll give you an idea.

433
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:45,620
A lot of survival stuff, the best quality stuff out there.

434
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:54,880
We've got the very best essential oil systems put out by our friends over at Interfood.

435
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:59,980
We've got the Army Ranger style black caps, it's come to the Oathkeeper style in fullwars.com.

436
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:00,980
Okay, I'm done plugging.

437
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:02,980
I just haven't been plugging much the last month.

438
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:08,660
I've been so focused on defending the Second Amendment that I haven't even been midair

439
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:11,340
refueling our news operation system.

440
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:16,140
Cuz we're not like the mainstream media that gets government bailouts and tax exemptions

441
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:19,940
and then tries to overthrow the Republic, tries to get your taxes raised cuz they get

442
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:22,020
the corporate welfare bailout money.

443
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:24,460
They're subsidiaries of banks that do.

444
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:25,860
We just sell products we believe in.

445
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:29,700
And of course, the media says that's horrible, that's evil.

446
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:36,940
How dare us, how dare us, how dare us, how dare us, pay our own way, promoting high quality

447
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:38,480
products at great prices.

448
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,480
It's totally immoral.

449
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:45,680
And that's what they always say at CNN, you name it.

450
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:49,340
They always say the same thing, they say I'm evil.

451
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:53,360
And every time the national media comes to interview me, they go, how dare you make money?

452
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:56,380
This is a pretty big operation, you got a lot of crew members, you got a lot of equipment

453
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:57,380
here.

454
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:58,380
You're making money, that's bad.

455
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:01,660
I'm like, well, did you fly here, first class?

456
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:03,740
You did, didn't you?

457
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:04,740
You're in New York, aren't you?

458
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:06,140
How much you paid a year?

459
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:09,100
Oh, a million dollars, read off a teleprompter.

460
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:11,220
You're here lecturing me.

461
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:16,340
Anyway, side issue, just amazing how they play these mind games with us.

462
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:19,020
Here's the toll free number to join us.

463
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:29,540
It's 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231, and we'll get you up and on the air.

464
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:33,620
Well, that high def camera's so good, you can even see the dust on top, the live on

465
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:34,620
air right there.

466
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:35,620
No, that's okay.

467
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:37,620
It's not your job to clean in here.

468
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:38,620
I think we do have a cleaning crew.

469
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:39,940
I don't think they ever come in here though.

470
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:42,380
I guess because they see it as like the big studio.

471
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:43,780
Oh my gosh.

472
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:48,780
There's like a dead fruit fly over there or something.

473
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:56,820
We're to start here, 800-259-9231, on any issue you wish to discuss, I got a couple

474
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:57,820
of news items.

475
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:00,620
I want to hit them and then we're going to your phone calls.

476
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:07,980
And let me just show folks in the document cam, hey, hey guys, we got a camera mounted

477
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:08,980
in there.

478
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:09,980
Can we punch that up for viewers?

479
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:11,980
Here, come on over and say hi to folks.

480
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:14,340
No, no, just right there in that microphone.

481
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:17,540
Hello fans, Obama phone lady here.

482
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:18,980
How's that audio, Genesis?

483
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:19,980
Show today.

484
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:22,380
You better open your phones in your head.

485
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:25,500
Hey, can you give a shout out to everybody?

486
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:28,020
No, go ahead.

487
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:33,780
I'm going to give a shout out to everybody here in Austin, Texas.

488
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:35,900
I'm on the Alex Jones show.

489
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:40,500
I'm the Obama phone lady representing Alex Jones here today.

490
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,660
And I love that guy.

491
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:44,780
He's funny like me.

492
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:51,300
Oh my goodness, there's no doubt, and I'm not just saying this, you could do voiceovers

493
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:52,300
immediately.

494
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:55,740
I'm going to work on your radio station before I leave here.

495
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:56,740
I think you might.

496
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,140
Have you heard the news?

497
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:05,140
I'm going to officially offer you on air, at least an auxiliary paid job as a reporter.

498
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:08,780
All right, hallelujah, yes, thank you.

499
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:12,580
I also want to make sure you like the terms, I'm going to work it all out, but I'm very

500
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:13,580
glad you're excited.

501
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:16,380
I'm excited about that, I need a job.

502
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:19,020
Darn it, May, Obama, you see what you've done?

503
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:26,620
I'm moving up in the world, you're going to do your job, I'm going to set you down.

504
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:28,620
What do you think of the rest of the crew?

505
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:29,620
I love the crew.

506
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:33,300
You got your kids out, anytime you can go to work and bring your kids, that's the job.

507
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:34,740
That's what I'm trying to get to.

508
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:39,180
That's right, well, don't give out too many of our security issues, but yes, no, my son,

509
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:40,180
I'm just joking.

510
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:45,140
Jakari, what do you think of all this, Jakari Jackson back there?

511
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:50,660
This is quite a deal for me, Michelle and I have something in common, we just made a

512
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:57,780
YouTube video and somebody liked our voice enough to give us a job, so I can relate to

513
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:00,500
her on that.

514
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:02,100
Thank you, Jesus, well.

515
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:06,500
He's the man, he's the man, but Obama with the man with the plan, but we're going to

516
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:07,500
see what he's going to do.

517
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:11,780
If he don't do the right thing, I'm going to be the woman with the plan, Michelle Obama

518
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:13,580
and Michelle Dowery.

519
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:17,740
That's right, ladies and gentlemen, all right, you think I'm joking, she's here, some people

520
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:19,380
still think I'm joking.

521
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:23,780
I mean, I think everybody is more freaked out about you being here in a good way than

522
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:26,260
when I've had movie stars here walking around in the halls.

523
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:30,660
And I got the blood of Jesus, baby, I'm here, all right?

524
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:34,860
All right, we're very excited, ladies and gentlemen, she is in the house.

525
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:40,100
I'll tell you, guys, why don't we get her some lunch or something, or take her back

526
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:44,940
in the green room, because it's so exciting to have her here that I can barely even operate

527
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:45,940
right now.

528
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:50,980
All right, ladies and gentlemen, I'll tell you what, Michelle, run in here real quick.

529
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:55,980
Run in here real quick, Michelle, come on in the studio, come on, we got to give people

530
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:58,380
a taste of this right now.

531
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:00,820
Come on right around here.

532
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:03,260
That's right, no, no, come on right over here by my microphone, you're just going to pop

533
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:05,700
in for a moment, okay, come on in.

534
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:08,900
We've got the camera right over here, say hi to folks right there.

535
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:09,900
Hello, folks.

536
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:12,100
Let's go to this camera right here, guys.

537
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:14,700
Hello, folks, I'm here today, the Obama phone lady.

538
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:17,060
Here she is, here, here, talking the mic, oops, go ahead.

539
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:22,500
I'm here today, you guys, I'm here in Austin, Texas, I'm at the Alex Jones show, I want

540
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:27,740
you guys to represent, I'm here, the Obama phone lady, I arrive, I'm ready to get it

541
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:29,060
going on, let's do it.

542
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:31,620
All right, we'll see you in here in about an hour.

543
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:34,060
Good job, there you go, ladies and gentlemen.

544
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:39,040
That is proof of life, as they say, all right, absolutely, ladies and gentlemen, there she

545
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,040
is.

546
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:46,020
Okay, now let's shift gears into the really, really bad news.

547
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:52,140
And again, guys, I hear another mic open now, whatever's going on, okay, got that mic shut

548
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:56,740
down cuz you get that taken care of, you know what I'm gonna do?

549
00:45:56,740 --> 00:46:08,100
They're moving ahead right now with draconian moves, where they're just gonna tell, as I

550
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:12,940
told you, gun manufacturers, you can't manufacture this, no law, they're just gonna say it.

551
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:16,580
They're moving ahead with telling shops you just can't sell guns.

552
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:21,860
And Chuck Schumer has announced that, the article is up at infowars.com.

553
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:25,300
New York has tentative deal on gun control, they're just gonna throw anybody they want

554
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:28,880
in the nut house, no judge, no jury, you're just going to the nut house.

555
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:32,340
And Rahm Emanuel is announcing in the Washington Post what he said years ago, they'll just

556
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:37,860
put you on a no gun buy list, no judge, no jury, no proof, no nothing, you just disappear.

557
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:41,540
Like Brandon Robb, the Marine, who criticized Obama.

558
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:46,020
And so we are going to be discussing all of that today, but let me just go ahead and go

559
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:50,100
to your phone calls right now here, ladies and gentlemen.

560
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:53,660
Let's go ahead and talk to Dexter in Maryland.

561
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:56,540
Dexter, you're on the air.

562
00:46:56,540 --> 00:47:01,100
Yeah, your phone's really, really low, brother.

563
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:02,100
Is that an Obama phone?

564
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:03,100
Is this a little better?

565
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:04,100
Yes, sir, go ahead.

566
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:12,900
Okay, well, first of all, congratulations for Piers Morgan interview, that was epic.

567
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:17,220
I do believe he'll have you back around too, who could be so desperate for ratings, and

568
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:19,220
it would be huge.

569
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:23,340
But what I wanted to talk about was Sandy Hook.

570
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:27,420
I'm somebody that believes that there's some fishiness there, and I'd like to go through

571
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:28,420
a couple of things.

572
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:30,620
I'm not sure if you've seen all these things yet.

573
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:37,620
First, have you seen the video where the little girl's father comes out, like the first guy

574
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:39,580
that came out to give an interview?

575
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:42,620
Yeah, he's laughing and smiling, and he says, do I read off the card?

576
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:47,660
And then he turns the camera and then breaks, and then sits there and looks like he's forcing

577
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:48,660
himself to cry.

578
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:56,260
And then it looks like bad acting from the worst soap opera you've ever seen.

579
00:47:56,260 --> 00:48:02,300
But people act strange under incredible pressure, so none of us know what he's going through.

580
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:08,260
So my prayers go out to him and his family.

581
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:10,860
But yeah, a lot of people are investigating the whole thing.

582
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:17,020
Well, one thing that's weird about him is that his daughter, by the end of the day,

583
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:23,300
she had a Facebook page up that was a tribute that was already looking for money.

584
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:27,540
It seems kind of odd that so quickly, just a few hours after-

585
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:28,540
Well, listen, here's the deal.

586
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:29,540
I appreciate your call, bro.

587
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:35,380
Look, I don't know about that, and I'm not going to talk about parents of dead kids,

588
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:36,780
okay?

589
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:40,300
And see, I don't know if that's true.

590
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:41,740
That's something I haven't seen.

591
00:48:41,740 --> 00:48:46,980
And so it's just, I'm not gonna talk about somebody who lost his daughter.

592
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:51,940
Yes, there wasn't the AR-15 inside the school, yes, it was in the car, yes, there were multiple

593
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:53,220
shooters outside.

594
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:57,980
Mainstream media, RT has attacked me, saying, five-year-olds said they saw multiple shooters.

595
00:48:57,980 --> 00:49:02,260
No, it's on footage from the surveillance cameras, from the helicopter they put on the

596
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:05,740
news, showing them arresting people in the woods dressed like the supposed shooter.

597
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:06,980
And the whole thing's suspicious, okay?

598
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:09,140
And I'm not trying to jump on you, caller.

599
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:12,900
It's just that there are a lot of reports out there, a lot of people questioning the

600
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:13,900
whole thing.

601
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:17,740
But I'm not going to sit there and go after the dad.

602
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:24,300
It's just, I'm gonna let other people do their own research, I'm gonna leave it at that.

603
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:26,780
Jessica in Canada, you're on the air.

604
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:28,620
Hi, Alex.

605
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:29,620
Hey.

606
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:34,780
I just wanted to, you did a great job with peers, and I just wanted to bring you up to

607
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:38,620
date on a couple of things that are happening with Agenda 21 here in Canada.

608
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:40,020
Tell us about it.

609
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:45,940
Well, one, our environmental commissioner here in Ontario has decided that food waste

610
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:49,340
is an environmental problem.

611
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:52,740
And I just noticed that the UN has taken up this issue, so they're coming after our food,

612
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:53,740
Alex.

613
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:56,700
No, no, they're going to, they've already done this in England, and they're going to

614
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:59,900
tax you for everything that goes in the trash can.

615
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:04,200
And they're going to have RFID on all the products that is scanned, this is already

616
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:10,240
happening in London, to track, and they'll give you $3,000 fines for every attraction.

617
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:13,380
It's already on the books in several Florida cities.

618
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:16,140
And they go, don't worry, we'll never implement it.

619
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:20,500
Kind of like they put it on the books under federal grants, start taking blood without

620
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:24,100
warrants 15 years ago, now they're doing it.

621
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:28,860
So you're absolutely right, Agenda 21 is a total surveillance grid where all the appliances

622
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:34,060
track you, and where they tax you to the point of total bankruptcy.

623
00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:37,180
It's to make sure you stay poor.

624
00:50:37,180 --> 00:50:40,700
And that you have to go on government subsistence so they can then shoot you up with deadly

625
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:41,700
vaccines.

626
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:46,540
Have you looked into Idle No More, because it looks like the Tides Foundation is radicalizing

627
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:48,620
our natives up here.

628
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:52,180
Yeah, it's everywhere, the Tides Foundation is involved in a ton of stuff.

629
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:54,660
Did you have anything else you wanted to add on the agenda 21?

630
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:58,580
Nope, this is on Land Use Planner, and I've been fighting this for eight years.

631
00:50:58,580 --> 00:51:01,500
Well, good job, you give them hell.

632
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:06,820
Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the bestselling book, Cancer Step Outside the

633
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:07,820
Box.

634
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:10,780
I want you to know some very important information.

635
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:15,580
In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White

636
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:19,900
House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.

637
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:25,460
Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.

638
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:30,540
Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally

639
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:35,700
occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single

640
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:36,820
normal cell.

641
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:40,580
If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune

642
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:44,580
cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.

643
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:52,500

645
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:00,860
That's your immune system.

646
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:03,860
It's the only one you've got.

647
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:08,460
Big business has discovered the preparedness market, and that makes it difficult to know

648
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:10,660
where to go and who to trust.

660
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:02,220
MyPatriotsSupply.com.

661
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:07,740
We travel so much, and having a fake TV, well, it gives added peace of mind.

662
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:13,640
Burglars look for houses that appear to be easy targets, but fake TV can fool even professional

663
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:17,260
burglars into thinking someone is home watching television.

664
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:22,300
As a recent widow living alone, it gives me great peace of mind to set my fake TV near

665
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:26,780
a window and know that passing motorists and pedestrians will think someone is home watching

666
00:53:26,780 --> 00:53:29,820
TV when I'm actually away from home.

667
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:34,420
Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet, just like a light on a timer.

668
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:38,300
And they're so easy to use, you just plug them in and they're ready to go.

669
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:42,340
Plus, they're so affordable that we have one upstairs and downstairs.

670
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:45,420
Fake TV is only $34.95.

671
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:52,660
Order your fake TV by calling 877-5FAKETV or go to Faketv.com.

672
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:58,540
That's 877-532-5388 or Faketv.com.

673
00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:18,380
Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.

674
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:28,660
And he decides who to free and who to blame, everybody won't be treated all the same.

675
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:39,900
There'll be a golden letter reaching down when the man comes around.

676
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:40,900
We are back live.

677
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:42,540
The hairs on your arm will stand up.

678
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:44,540
Hi, I'm Alex Jones, your host.

679
00:54:44,540 --> 00:54:46,540
Let's go back to your phone calls.

680
00:54:46,540 --> 00:54:49,500
George in Texas, you're on the air.

681
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:53,140
I noticed you called in about gun control, you volunteered.

682
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:59,380
Are you excited that they're trial ballooning executive orders, ATF rulemaking, or just

683
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:04,700
Chuckie Schumer ordering Walmart and others to stop selling semi-autos?

684
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:09,780
I mean, they're really trying to see if they can just sell us on being dictators.

685
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:12,840
Yeah, I absolutely agree.

686
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:18,380
And I first wanted to congratulate you on your appearance with Piers Morgan on CNN,

687
00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:20,060
the state-run media.

688
00:55:20,060 --> 00:55:22,420
And I believe you did exactly what it takes.

689
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:25,260
I think they're scared because you broke the spell.

690
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:30,660
And I think this rush and this barrage of legislation, all the draconian legislation

691
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:35,540
that's coming out, I think it's very clear that you forced their hand.

692
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:36,540
And I don't think they were ready.

693
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:39,460
I think it's too early for them and that's why they're so upset.

694
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:43,460
Well, I don't think I did it, but I'm certainly part of it, and so are you.

695
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:45,820
We're all together in this.

696
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:48,940
But earlier I said I would get into the victory, get into what's positive.

697
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:54,060
I haven't really done that yet, but I've already said it before, 10 million guns sold last

698
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:55,060
month.

699
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:56,500
They're talking about more guns sold this month.

700
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:59,260
They're saying soon everything will be sold out.

701
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:02,380
There won't even be bolt action 22s.

702
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:04,620
Everything is going to be sold out.

703
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:06,940
The ammo is selling out everywhere.

704
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:08,540
That's the real vote.

705
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:12,540
America knows the government is criminal and can't be trusted.

706
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:16,460
America knows we're going into a depression and the state run media lies.

707
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:20,900
And we've talked about what to name the corporate globalist trader media.

708
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:21,900
That's it.

709
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:24,340
It's state run media.

710
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:26,580
That's the best term for it.

711
00:56:26,580 --> 00:56:31,240
And we're dealing with a global corporate fascist state that uses socialism at the grassroots

712
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:33,540
to control us like flypaper.

713
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:35,380
And there is a revolt.

714
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:37,060
People are waking up.

715
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:42,020
And that's why they're trying to act all confident and we've got a mandate for socialism now.

716
00:56:42,020 --> 00:56:43,960
Obama wasn't really reelected.

717
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:48,140
They had that thing fixed seven ways to Sunday, running him up against that political corpse

718
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:50,980
Romney election.

719
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:56,960
But even the evidence shows even though Romney was a dead horse, still he really beat Obama

720
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:00,600
of the election fraud evidence shows and not that that would have been good.

721
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:01,920
He's globalist as well.

722
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:04,700
They just think Obama can con people better.

723
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:05,700
I'm sorry, I'm ranting.

724
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:08,380
No, no, no, no, you're good.

725
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:10,140
And you know, I'd like to make two points with you.

726
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:14,540
I'd like you to explain to people just what a semiautomatic weapon actually is, because

727
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:19,260
I don't think a lot of people realize that it includes pistols and handguns.

728
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:24,420
I think they associate it with fully automatic and they associate it with assault rifles

729
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:26,420
and they don't understand exactly what.

730
00:57:26,420 --> 00:57:31,460
Well, Feinstein has called for even revolvers to be banned before, but technically a semiauto

731
00:57:31,460 --> 00:57:35,600
is pull the trigger once a bullet fires, pull it again, it fires again.

732
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:40,340
And they obsess over full auto that's worthless for actually killing people if you wanna be

733
00:57:40,340 --> 00:57:41,340
selective about it.

734
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:44,460
That's what the military doesn't use full auto, unless it's a heavy machine gun with

735
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:50,300
big boxes of ammo in emplacements to take out large numbers of infantry.

736
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:54,500
Or sometimes even used on the ground to mark targets in a primitive way for aircraft that

737
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:55,500
are coming in.

738
00:57:55,500 --> 00:58:02,500
They use tracers to mark targets and do other things, but that's another issue studying

739
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:04,160
military warfare.

740
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:08,700
The truth is, when they say ban semiautos, you don't need assault rifles and they show

741
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:14,860
a scary looking black M16, why people think that's scary, I don't know.

742
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:18,360
And then they are saying, let's just get rid of these, when really it gets rid of almost

743
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:21,200
all guns, almost all shotguns, everything.

744
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:26,260
Most guns are semiauto and they wanna get rid of them, but their new bills even get

745
00:58:26,260 --> 00:58:28,980
rid of pump shotguns.

746
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:33,100
So I mean, they're coming for almost everything, does that answer what you wanted me to do?

747
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:37,820
No, yeah, absolutely, and if I could, I'd like to tie that into an article you just

748
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:40,060
had run yesterday on the death of Aaron Schwart.

749
00:58:40,060 --> 00:58:41,060
Yeah, stay there.

750
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:53,300

01:00:12,460 --> 01:00:13,460
You want answers?

767
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:15,580
Well, so does he.

768
01:00:15,580 --> 01:00:19,780
He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.

769
01:00:19,780 --> 01:00:23,900
And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.

770
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:31,420
All right, we're taking your phone calls ahead of Obama phone lady joining us in studio.

771
01:00:31,420 --> 01:00:35,660
Now I'm going to have a serious talk with her.

772
01:00:35,660 --> 01:00:43,300
And sure, we will have her on as a example of collectivization.

773
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:47,940
And at the same time, though, that she's a smart lady and has humanity in her, like all

774
01:00:47,940 --> 01:00:52,580
of us do, and then hopefully I can get through to her about Obama.

775
01:00:52,580 --> 01:00:53,980
So that is coming up.

776
01:00:53,980 --> 01:00:59,300
But Georgia and Texas, yeah, Obama killed this critic found dead in New York City, prominent

777
01:00:59,300 --> 01:01:05,060
American blogger, and the guy that really headed up killing SOPA, the Internet takeover,

778
01:01:05,060 --> 01:01:06,460
found hung.

779
01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:13,820
And they were trying to put him in jail for 35 years for downloading some MIT policy papers,

780
01:01:13,820 --> 01:01:18,260
research papers that taxpayers paid for, and posting them for the public to have.

781
01:01:18,260 --> 01:01:21,500
Talk about military industrial complex, so they say, he committed suicide.

782
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:22,500
That's what they'll do.

783
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:24,940
They'll indict you, say you're depressed and kill you.

784
01:01:24,940 --> 01:01:28,260
Listen, if I ever get indicted, I'm going to fight it forever.

785
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:30,180
I will never commit suicide.

786
01:01:30,180 --> 01:01:33,860
And what they do is, even though the DC madam sat on my show, she never committed suicide.

787
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:36,940
And then I knew behind the scenes she was being followed, being harassed.

788
01:01:36,940 --> 01:01:41,420
And I even had her condo manager on saying he was friends with her and that he even gave

789
01:01:41,420 --> 01:01:42,420
me her handwriting.

790
01:01:42,420 --> 01:01:43,420
It wasn't her.

791
01:01:43,420 --> 01:01:46,020
They put out the suicide note, wasn't even close.

792
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:49,900
A totally different handwriting and that she was being followed by men, was bringing stuff

793
01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:50,900
over to her mothers.

794
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:54,380
She killed her and her mothers out in the shed.

795
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:57,420
And she said, I'll never commit suicide.

796
01:01:57,420 --> 01:01:59,740
And then of course, somebody says, I'll never commit suicide.

797
01:01:59,740 --> 01:02:04,460
They have a quote, friend, someone who doesn't even really know them, always comes out in

798
01:02:04,460 --> 01:02:08,860
the news and said, shit, she told me she was gonna commit suicide.

799
01:02:08,860 --> 01:02:09,860
So that's what will happen.

800
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:16,500
If they ever kill me, they'll have a friend come out and say, Alex told me he was.

801
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:21,040
And that person, that person was told by the killers and paid by the killer to do it.

802
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:24,620
That person, that's the person involved, okay?

803
01:02:24,620 --> 01:02:26,100
You understand that?

804
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:28,540
Cuz that's a bunch of baloney.

805
01:02:28,540 --> 01:02:32,700
If I was diagnosed with cancer, I will go with Darth Vader level surgeries and everything

806
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:33,700
else.

807
01:02:33,700 --> 01:02:34,700
Alternative, you name it, okay?

808
01:02:34,700 --> 01:02:42,420
I'm gonna go out of this world kicking and screaming and snapping like a crocodile, okay?

809
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:43,660
Let's just get that straight.

810
01:02:43,660 --> 01:02:45,940
I'm going all the way, okay?

811
01:02:45,940 --> 01:02:50,700
Darth Vader level medicine, brain surgery, you name it, lungs out on the table, open

812
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:53,300
heart surgery, whatever it is, I'm doing it.

813
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:55,220
Let's get that straight.

814
01:02:55,220 --> 01:03:00,740
I'm never gonna commit suicide, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never,

815
01:03:00,740 --> 01:03:03,100
never, never, never, never, never.

816
01:03:03,100 --> 01:03:06,500
And I would never murder, suicide my family.

817
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:11,140
That's one of their other favorites, just to wipe out a whole family.

818
01:03:11,140 --> 01:03:15,420
Never that ever happens, God forbid, knock on wood, pray to Jesus, it won't happen.

819
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:17,220
And you know I was killed.

820
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:20,020
Real fast, your comments on that, George?

821
01:03:20,020 --> 01:03:23,260
I'm glad you said that, cuz this is really a personal issue for me.

822
01:03:23,260 --> 01:03:26,620
The similarities between myself and Aaron Swartz, this is George from Austin.

823
01:03:26,620 --> 01:03:29,420
I was out at the drone mob event, you had me in studio.

824
01:03:29,420 --> 01:03:35,300
I did the drone peaceful protest, and I actually just made a video and uploaded it saying the

825
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:36,300
exact same thing.

826
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:40,100
I took a cue from you after the Piers Morgan show, yeah, I saw your videos when you're

827
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:43,100
in the hotel, you're being followed, I saw the security guy.

828
01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:48,420
And so I felt I had to make a video and post it up on YouTube saying the exact same thing.

829
01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:53,180
I'll never commit suicide, I love my life, I love my country, and I believe the solution

830
01:03:53,180 --> 01:03:59,980
to this is just to tell the truth, wake people up, political commentary, and you know, it's

831
01:03:59,980 --> 01:04:05,260
really sad that I'm in fear that I could end up in the exact same situation.

832
01:04:05,260 --> 01:04:09,420
And so I posted that video up on YouTube, and I don't know if you would allow me to,

833
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:12,860
but I'd really feel a lot safer if your listeners could go take a look at it.

834
01:04:12,860 --> 01:04:13,860
Sure, what's the name of it?

835
01:04:13,860 --> 01:04:17,580
This is your video, it's YouTube.com slash Young Truthers.

836
01:04:17,580 --> 01:04:24,140
All right, listen, I gotta jump, but listen, folks, the number one cause of death is automobile

837
01:04:24,140 --> 01:04:25,140
accidents.

838
01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:29,660
Well, not anymore now, it's suicide, people killing themselves, then it's cars.

839
01:04:29,660 --> 01:04:34,140
You're risking your life every day driving with cars going 70 in this lane, you're going

840
01:04:34,140 --> 01:04:35,140
70 in this lane.

841
01:04:35,140 --> 01:04:38,700
If you hit it's 140 mile an hour, you're dead, I don't care how many seatbelts you're wearing,

842
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:41,660
you're dead 99% of the time, okay, you're dead.

843
01:04:41,660 --> 01:04:45,620
I drive on roads where people die every week, okay?

844
01:04:45,620 --> 01:04:51,340
And I still do it cuz I like to drive, folks, take their power away, you're gonna die anyway

845
01:04:51,340 --> 01:04:52,340
someday.

846
01:04:52,340 --> 01:04:55,500
Let me tell you, they keep killing people like this, folks aren't gonna put up with

847
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:59,160
it, and I'm not calling for that, but New World Order folks are the ones better watch

848
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:02,820
their butts.

849
01:05:02,820 --> 01:05:05,780

How'd he give you a phone?

929
01:09:34,380 --> 01:09:42,140
By the way, guys, that's enough.

930
01:09:42,140 --> 01:09:47,120
We are playing her out of the studio and she's right there sitting behind him.

931
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:51,420
And I gotta be honest, I mean, I'm getting goosebumps here and butterflies.

932
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:54,100
Ma'am, can you please go to the green room?

933
01:09:54,100 --> 01:09:56,860
You're such a big star and I'm not joking for whatever reason.

934
01:09:56,860 --> 01:10:00,540
I'm having trouble continuing the broadcast here with you in there.

935
01:10:00,540 --> 01:10:06,100
Do you get that chocolate shake I got you?

936
01:10:06,100 --> 01:10:10,300
She's awesome, absolutely awesome.

937
01:10:10,300 --> 01:10:11,300
She's right there.

938
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:14,140
I see you, this is incredible.

939
01:10:14,140 --> 01:10:15,140
She's already in command.

940
01:10:15,140 --> 01:10:17,140
She's, all right, you can stay there, that's fine.

941
01:10:17,140 --> 01:10:19,940
I just, it's, man, it is distracting.

942
01:10:19,940 --> 01:10:22,980
I tell you, this is a real fringe benefit.

943
01:10:22,980 --> 01:10:26,780
It's like caviar, being able to have, that's one good thing about my job, I get to meet

944
01:10:26,780 --> 01:10:28,900
interesting people.

945
01:10:28,900 --> 01:10:33,580
And we've had a lot of famous people in this building, but I tell you, nobody like Obama

946
01:10:33,580 --> 01:10:37,700
phone lady, which by the way, the Democrats, she was working for them.

947
01:10:37,700 --> 01:10:42,420
They went and put her on the desk job after that viral video you just saw.

948
01:10:42,420 --> 01:10:47,740
So, but we're gonna break that blockade here on air today with the Obama phone lady, but

949
01:10:47,740 --> 01:10:51,880
actually get down to the core of what this lady really stands for.

950
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:56,540
And again, I sent the link out to the video when she was on the show at Real Alex Jones.

951
01:10:56,540 --> 01:11:00,860
Just go to Twitter, forward slash, Real Alex Jones, you wanna find the link to the video

952
01:11:00,860 --> 01:11:06,800
last night of us hanging out around Austin, Texas, that video now obviously going viral.

953
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:12,100
And we're going to print, again, dozens of questions that listeners are sending in for

954
01:11:12,100 --> 01:11:13,100
her.

955
01:11:13,100 --> 01:11:16,820
She'll be with us for an hour and a half while we take phone calls.

956
01:11:16,820 --> 01:11:19,220
We're gonna have her in studio and she's gonna do more.

957
01:11:19,220 --> 01:11:23,580
She's gonna answer your questions.

958
01:11:23,580 --> 01:11:27,140
She's gonna describe why Romney sucks and why he sucks bad.

959
01:11:27,140 --> 01:11:28,900
So let's go back to your calls.

960
01:11:28,900 --> 01:11:29,900
You know what?

961
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:34,820
Let me get one news item before I do that because I'll never get to it if I don't.

962
01:11:34,820 --> 01:11:39,780
Right here on the document cam if you're watching on television, radio listeners just search

963
01:11:39,780 --> 01:11:45,300
New York has tentative deal on gun control.

964
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:47,960
And that's out of the Associated Press.

965
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:54,860
And they're going to have mental health law that allows for civil confinement of people

966
01:11:54,860 --> 01:11:57,780
determined to be a threat to others.

967
01:11:57,780 --> 01:12:01,940
And they're saying that if you criticize the government, that's a sign of mental illness.

968
01:12:01,940 --> 01:12:05,120
They're saying wanting to own guns is mental illness.

969
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:11,980
And here is a article out of the Washington Post today, where again, the so-called liberals

970
01:12:11,980 --> 01:12:16,760
or really the authoritarians, they dictate reality.

971
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:23,260
They say that when I went on Piers Morgan, that that was wrong, that I got in his face

972
01:12:23,260 --> 01:12:28,100
and that it was abnormal to yell or raise my voice.

973
01:12:28,100 --> 01:12:31,820
Now Governor Cuomo raised his voice when he said we're gonna get the guns last week,

974
01:12:31,820 --> 01:12:34,380
started yelling and screaming, everybody was cheering.

975
01:12:34,380 --> 01:12:40,300
Well that's okay, that's okay because he's calling for our rights to be taken.

976
01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:43,580
But when I said listen, don't try to take the guns or it'll cause a civil war, do you

977
01:12:43,580 --> 01:12:44,660
understand that?

978
01:12:44,660 --> 01:12:47,360
Ron Paul agreed with me two days later last week.

979
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:51,580
Just search Ron Paul says, Second Amendment is the line in the sand, attempt to take guns

980
01:12:51,580 --> 01:12:53,900
will cause civil war.

981
01:12:53,900 --> 01:12:55,820
Well, that's bad too.

982
01:12:55,820 --> 01:13:00,180
But when you read this article, whom does Alex Jones represent?

983
01:13:00,180 --> 01:13:07,260
They play this game of saying, mainline conservatives, Alex Jones represents you and this is bad.

984
01:13:07,260 --> 01:13:11,180
You're discredited now, your Second Amendment's discredited.

985
01:13:11,180 --> 01:13:12,180
It's a total mind game.

986
01:13:12,180 --> 01:13:15,820
It's like them saying, there are no bills that take any of your guns, it's a conspiracy

987
01:13:15,820 --> 01:13:16,820
theory.

988
01:13:16,820 --> 01:13:19,100
Though this bill does take your guns, it's no big deal.

989
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:23,300
You're like, you just said you don't take my guns.

990
01:13:23,300 --> 01:13:30,140
But because they're the boss, they're on the throne, up above us, in the clouds, okay,

991
01:13:30,140 --> 01:13:37,700
you've introduced 11 bills that some of them even take pump shotguns federally and they're

992
01:13:37,700 --> 01:13:38,700
at state levels.

993
01:13:38,700 --> 01:13:43,020
And you've got state reps calling for door to door gun confiscation, mainstream news

994
01:13:43,020 --> 01:13:45,020
covered that yesterday.

995
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:49,660
All of this is going on, the military training manuals for confiscating guns, all this is

996
01:13:49,660 --> 01:13:53,020
happening and they go, nobody wants your guns.

997
01:13:53,020 --> 01:13:54,020
Nobody's coming after your guns.

998
01:13:54,020 --> 01:13:58,540
And when that tank was slamming into the Waco church, and they had troops behind it firing

999
01:13:58,540 --> 01:14:01,640
their M16s into the building, the flare footage is clear.

1000
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:04,020
They were saying, this is not an assault, come out with your hands up.

1001
01:14:04,020 --> 01:14:07,060
And there's footage of Davidians coming out with their hands up, you can see their body

1002
01:14:07,060 --> 01:14:10,920
resonance heat, the flare footage, and they just shoot them, they fall down, and the tank

1003
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:12,740
runs over them.

1004
01:14:12,740 --> 01:14:17,180
But they said, this is not an assault, come out with your hands up.

1005
01:14:17,180 --> 01:14:23,180
And when they would come out, this is too big of a distraction now, my son and Obama

1006
01:14:23,180 --> 01:14:29,500
lady together, hey, hey, hey, hey, everybody out of the studio, seriously, out, out, okay?

1007
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:31,620
Yeah, that goes to my son, okay?

1008
01:14:31,620 --> 01:14:36,820
It's a circus out there, man, I can't focus, there's all this stuff going on out there.

1009
01:14:36,820 --> 01:14:44,020
Well, talk about chomping at the bit to be on the radio, that's my son.

1010
01:14:44,020 --> 01:14:46,960
What is the point I was getting to here?

1011
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:52,560
They are selling everyone that they control reality.

1012
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:57,960
And so number one, if so-called conservatives don't agree with what I say, that's fine.

1013
01:14:57,960 --> 01:15:01,860
We're not collectivist, I don't speak for you, you don't speak for me.

1014
01:15:01,860 --> 01:15:06,780
But everybody's got to, we've got to be nice and turn some of our guns in, and we've got

1015
01:15:06,780 --> 01:15:10,500
to not raise our voices, and we've got to, yeah.

1016
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:15,260
How's that work for people that are constitutionalist, conservatives, libertarians, whatever you

1017
01:15:15,260 --> 01:15:16,260
want to call it?

1018
01:15:16,260 --> 01:15:23,460
I mean, Romney was for Obamacare, he wrote the thing for banning semi-autos, for open

1019
01:15:23,460 --> 01:15:31,300
borders, for carbon taxes, should I keep going on here?

1020
01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:37,300
And that's who they ran so he would lose, like a rigged Don King boxing match, I mean,

1021
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:38,780
come on, folks.

1022
01:15:38,780 --> 01:15:42,700
And so I get up there and I go, listen, stop saying you don't want our guns, and stop saying

1023
01:15:42,700 --> 01:15:45,580
this is about kids, this is about authoritarianism.

1024
01:15:45,580 --> 01:15:49,900
You're on notice, don't start the Civil War, is that clear?

1025
01:15:49,900 --> 01:15:53,800
You're a mouthpiece for globalist criminals, and I'm putting you on notice.

1026
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:57,620
That's exactly what, in fact, I wish I'd have been more hardcore, instead of even responding

1027
01:15:57,620 --> 01:16:00,740
to anything he was saying.

1028
01:16:00,740 --> 01:16:04,980
Now that hindsight's 20-20, I should have done more.

1029
01:16:04,980 --> 01:16:09,600
Paul Revere wrote through the countryside when they came for the guns, saying to arms,

1030
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:15,420
to arms, the British are coming, the redcoats are coming, one is my land, two is my sea.

1031
01:16:15,420 --> 01:16:20,300
Our forebears went out and killed people.

1032
01:16:20,300 --> 01:16:24,540
I'm not calling for that, I don't want that to start, I wanna fix this peacefully.

1033
01:16:24,540 --> 01:16:30,420
But if so-called libertarians and conservatives can't handle somebody going, listen, you twit,

1034
01:16:30,420 --> 01:16:33,260
go back to your country and stop telling me to turn my guns in.

1035
01:16:33,260 --> 01:16:43,220
If they can't handle it, then may your chains set lightly upon you, lick the hand that feeds

1036
01:16:43,220 --> 01:16:45,420
you, crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you.

1037
01:16:45,420 --> 01:16:48,780
Will you guys print me the Patrick Henry, liberty or death speech?

1038
01:16:48,780 --> 01:16:53,340
I mean, why does New Hampshire say liberty or death on the license plates?

1039
01:16:53,340 --> 01:16:56,620
Why do we get a tear in our eyes at the Star Spangled Banner?

1040
01:16:56,620 --> 01:16:57,620
What's that song about?

1041
01:16:57,620 --> 01:17:03,300
It's about people on a fort under bombardment, not giving up.

1042
01:17:03,300 --> 01:17:08,860
It's about ragtag farmers and people taking on a military that had defeated the Spanish,

1043
01:17:08,860 --> 01:17:13,180
the French, the Dutch, the Portuguese, you want me to keep going here?

1044
01:17:13,180 --> 01:17:24,860
I mean, the British Army a few years later beat Napoleon.

1045
01:17:24,860 --> 01:17:33,740
And our ancestors literally had to go bushwhack people by the end of the war to get ammo.

1046
01:17:33,740 --> 01:17:37,460
And they don't want you knowing about that, I'm up here just saying, hey, man, don't come

1047
01:17:37,460 --> 01:17:41,420
to my country and tell me turn my guns in and tell us collectively as gun owners that

1048
01:17:41,420 --> 01:17:44,420
it's our fault somebody died.

1049
01:17:44,420 --> 01:17:46,460
It's your fault for making that a gun free zone.

1050
01:17:46,460 --> 01:17:49,860
It's your fault for advertising the place to go kill people as a school.

1051
01:17:49,860 --> 01:17:51,220
Well, that really got to them.

1052
01:17:51,220 --> 01:17:55,380
They were going pull the plug when I said that they were no, no, no, cuz they know that

1053
01:17:55,380 --> 01:18:02,100
they know for their their hype in school shootings every single day on corporate New World Order

1054
01:18:02,100 --> 01:18:10,820
globalist run traitor media, hoping mentally ill people go into schools and shoot people.

1055
01:18:10,820 --> 01:18:14,780
I mean, they are hyping copycatters like it's going out of style.

1056
01:18:14,780 --> 01:18:17,840
And I put them on notice, man, they're trying to get more kids killed.

1057
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:19,300
They're the ones that set the whole thing up.

1058
01:18:19,300 --> 01:18:25,340
They know full well that the drug inserts on those drugs, by the way, I've got Samjay

1059
01:18:25,340 --> 01:18:30,260
Gupta, whoever he pronounces him the brain surgeon, Gupta and Tom Ridge.

1060
01:18:30,260 --> 01:18:34,460
I saw a natural news article today, always great reporters, but I didn't see where the

1061
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:40,780
links were to Samjay Gupta and Ridge saying drugs are probably the cause of these shootings.

1062
01:18:40,780 --> 01:18:44,980
So I went and searched what they said, it might have just been an oversight.

1063
01:18:44,980 --> 01:18:49,580
And I actually found everything they said, I actually found the transcripts and the videos.

1064
01:18:49,580 --> 01:18:54,300
I've got those, I told Paul Watson to add links to it.

1065
01:18:54,300 --> 01:18:56,500
So good for that former head of Homeland Security.

1066
01:18:56,500 --> 01:18:57,700
And what's going on with Tom Ridge?

1067
01:18:57,700 --> 01:18:59,900
That guy has got like a conscience.

1068
01:18:59,900 --> 01:19:05,020
He wrote a book saying Bush put out fake terror alerts as the pretext to take our liberties.

1069
01:19:05,020 --> 01:19:07,700
And now he's come out and said, we gotta look at these drugs.

1070
01:19:07,700 --> 01:19:12,260
That's the main unifying issue.

1071
01:19:12,260 --> 01:19:17,700
I mean, good job, former head of Homeland Security Ridge.

1072
01:19:17,700 --> 01:19:19,420
By the way, the head of Homeland Security is a puppet, folks.

1073
01:19:19,420 --> 01:19:22,180
They usually don't even know half of what's going on.

1074
01:19:22,180 --> 01:19:25,020
This is an outside shadow government, not the front guys, you see.

1075
01:19:25,020 --> 01:19:26,780
And I'm not saying Ridge is a perfect guy.

1076
01:19:26,780 --> 01:19:31,800
I'm seeing signs, though, that he's got a heart and a soul, and that's all I'm looking

1077
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:32,800
for.

1078
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:36,860
All right, we'll take some more calls and get Obama phone lady in here.

1079
01:19:36,860 --> 01:19:42,420
And the point is, is that they're telling you what is acceptable behavior.

1080
01:19:42,420 --> 01:19:43,780
They're telling you what reality is.

1081
01:19:43,780 --> 01:19:47,340
They're telling you, you killed those kids collectively, so you have guilt.

1082
01:19:47,340 --> 01:19:49,220
And that makes me angry.

1083
01:19:49,220 --> 01:19:53,740
And they're trying to get more kids killed, okay?

1084
01:19:53,740 --> 01:19:56,740
Now what would George Washington do?

1085
01:19:56,740 --> 01:19:59,820
Would George Washington cower, appears Morgan?

1086
01:19:59,820 --> 01:20:03,180
What would Thomas Paine do?

1087
01:20:03,180 --> 01:20:08,020
Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive from natural disasters

1088
01:20:08,020 --> 01:20:12,600
like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on

1089
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:14,460
by a disastrous economy?

1090
01:20:14,460 --> 01:20:17,180
Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything.

1091
01:20:17,180 --> 01:20:20,980
At e Foods Direct, we hear from customers every day that are fortunate enough to weather

1092
01:20:20,980 --> 01:20:23,900
life's storm by having a supply of food on hand.

1093
01:20:23,900 --> 01:20:28,440
After Hurricane Sandy, Danny from New York City wrote, almost all the grocery stores

1094
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:33,260
are closed, but I managed to get my e Foods just in time to be able to help my sister

1095
01:20:33,260 --> 01:20:34,260
and niece.

1096
01:20:34,260 --> 01:20:38,060
It is better to be prepared 10 years too early than one day too late.

1097
01:20:38,060 --> 01:20:40,300
I can warn you, but I can't feed you.

1103
01:21:02,780 --> 01:21:07,060

1119
01:22:02,340 --> 01:22:04,360
What's going on with food prices?

1120
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:08,740
Have you noticed how your favorite ice cream is now 14 ounces instead of a pint?

1121
01:22:08,740 --> 01:22:14,580
Round trip air fares into nine major cities has increased 44% in just one year.

1122
01:22:14,580 --> 01:22:20,820
Ask your 18 to 25 year old what it costs to buy some nice fashionable jeans, $300?

1123
01:22:20,820 --> 01:22:26,020
And yet not one person in a hundred realizes these prices reflect government spending and

1124
01:22:26,020 --> 01:22:28,480
Federal Reserve Bank dollar printing.

1125
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:34,580
Gold in the last 10 years has increased 450% while the dollar's purchasing power is declining

1126
01:22:34,580 --> 01:22:35,580
daily.

1127
01:22:35,580 --> 01:22:36,940
My name is Daniel Larson.

1128
01:22:36,940 --> 01:22:38,900
I work at Midas Resources.

1132
01:22:55,660 --> 01:23:01,700
Daniel Larson, 800-686-2237, extension 134.

1133
01:23:01,700 --> 01:23:05,660
Hey there, Frank Bates here.

1134
01:23:05,660 --> 01:23:10,740
Have you heard about the weird device that could wipe out 280 million Americans?

1135
01:23:10,740 --> 01:23:12,800
This is really scary stuff.

1136
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:17,740
Bates experts warn that this odd device poses the gravest threat we've ever known.

1137
01:23:17,740 --> 01:23:22,040
In fact, just a few weeks ago, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich wrote an op-ed

1138
01:23:22,040 --> 01:23:25,700
piece for the Washington Post warning about this deadly threat.

1139
01:23:25,700 --> 01:23:28,580
I can't believe that more people aren't talking about this.

1140
01:23:28,580 --> 01:23:32,460
It may be because the liberals and the government are trying to cover it up.

1141
01:23:32,460 --> 01:23:38,140
That's why my friend just created a free video at weirddevice.com that exposes this threat

1142
01:23:38,140 --> 01:23:40,940
and blows the doors off the conspiracy.

1143
01:23:40,940 --> 01:23:46,700
Go watch the shocking video at weirddevice.com right now to discover exactly what it is,

1144
01:23:46,700 --> 01:23:51,700
plus discover the number one way you and your family can survive this deadly attack.

1145
01:23:51,700 --> 01:23:56,300
I'm not sure how long this video will be online, so go to weirddevice.com before it's gone

1146
01:23:56,300 --> 01:23:57,300
forever.

1147
01:23:57,300 --> 01:24:11,100
And that's weirddevice.com.

1148
01:24:11,100 --> 01:24:27,500
Coming up, we're not going to be fighting, though, but we are building it up the eye

1149
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:29,060
of the tiger.

1150
01:24:29,060 --> 01:24:37,100
The Obama phone lady right here in Austin, Texas, rising up the thrill of the fight is

1151
01:24:37,100 --> 01:24:38,340
the eye of the tiger.

1152
01:24:38,340 --> 01:24:43,660
In fact, we'll just re-intro her with this again, kind of like her royal entrance whenever

1153
01:24:43,660 --> 01:24:45,020
she comes on the broadcast.

1154
01:24:45,020 --> 01:24:47,540
It's the eye of the tiger.

1155
01:24:47,540 --> 01:24:48,540
There it is.

1156
01:24:48,540 --> 01:24:49,540
Oh, yeah.

1157
01:24:49,540 --> 01:25:10,140
It's the eye of the tiger.

1158
01:25:10,140 --> 01:25:11,140
Let's go ahead.

1159
01:25:11,140 --> 01:25:14,140
Everybody, you know you love that song, even though it's cheesy.

1160
01:25:14,140 --> 01:25:20,540
Everybody knows when they're driving along, they turn this up.

1161
01:25:20,540 --> 01:25:21,540
We're playing that off YouTube.

1162
01:25:21,540 --> 01:25:22,540
It's not doing it justice.

1163
01:25:22,540 --> 01:25:23,540
Here it is.

1164
01:25:23,540 --> 01:25:24,540
Crank it up.

1165
01:25:24,540 --> 01:25:25,540
Hey, she rose to the challenge.

1166
01:25:25,540 --> 01:25:36,540
Put her down here to be with the crazy Texan.

1167
01:25:36,540 --> 01:25:48,820
All right, Billy in California, you want to talk about Satan?

1168
01:25:48,820 --> 01:25:49,980
Go ahead.

1169
01:25:49,980 --> 01:25:52,620
You're on the air.

1170
01:25:52,620 --> 01:25:54,620
Thank you, Joan, for having me on right now.

1171
01:25:54,620 --> 01:25:55,620
You bet, buddy.

1172
01:25:55,620 --> 01:25:56,620
Yeah.

1173
01:25:56,620 --> 01:26:01,820
Just just want to talk to you about Jimmy Fazil.

1174
01:26:01,820 --> 01:26:05,460
They just recently found out in the UK articles, the UK articles that he was involved with

1175
01:26:05,460 --> 01:26:11,220
for satanic ritualism, which is a really big shock, not to not to us, of course.

1176
01:26:11,220 --> 01:26:15,100
But no, David, I said over a decade ago that he was a pedophile and a Satanist, and that's

1177
01:26:15,100 --> 01:26:16,100
on record.

1178
01:26:16,100 --> 01:26:20,620
And he said about a bunch of other people, you know, David, I worked at the BBC.

1179
01:26:20,620 --> 01:26:24,660
You can say what you want about the guy, but, you know, like George Arwell, he worked at

1180
01:26:24,660 --> 01:26:27,100
the highest levels of the BBC.

1181
01:26:27,100 --> 01:26:28,100
And of course, Sevelle.

1182
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:29,100
Yeah, you're right.

1183
01:26:29,100 --> 01:26:30,100
That's now coming out the Satanism.

1184
01:26:30,100 --> 01:26:31,100
Yep.

1185
01:26:31,100 --> 01:26:36,740
Yeah, basically, I was hoping, I know you do talk about this, you know, often about

1186
01:26:36,740 --> 01:26:41,740
how Satanism is involved in this, and I was wondering maybe if you could do a future show

1187
01:26:41,740 --> 01:26:47,820
really focusing on how deep Satanism has gone, you know, whether it be in Nazism, in the

1188
01:26:47,820 --> 01:26:53,580
past, and how it's led America down this path of darkness, and just really showing

1189
01:26:53,580 --> 01:26:57,720
people that, you know, we really need to understand that we're dealing with some super high

1190
01:26:57,720 --> 01:27:02,940
level, dynamic activity here as it leads America down the path of destruction.

1191
01:27:02,940 --> 01:27:06,900
Well, I mean, you could take one look at Jimmy Sevelle.

1192
01:27:06,900 --> 01:27:12,980
I mean, I can tell pretty much if somebody's a real Luciferian, because they look like

1193
01:27:12,980 --> 01:27:13,980
that in the eyes.

1194
01:27:13,980 --> 01:27:16,500
I don't care if they're black, white, who they are.

1195
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:21,260
That's a guy that hung out with a royal family like no one else and hung out and quote supplied

1196
01:27:21,260 --> 01:27:22,260
things.

1197
01:27:22,260 --> 01:27:23,260
He would brag.

1198
01:27:23,260 --> 01:27:25,220
I supply special things to government parties.

1199
01:27:25,220 --> 01:27:29,580
And see, they don't trust you at the highest levels of government now, because here's the

1200
01:27:29,580 --> 01:27:30,580
news, folks.

1201
01:27:30,580 --> 01:27:33,020
They don't just hurt the children, okay?

1202
01:27:33,020 --> 01:27:40,140
If it all comes out on this guy from my sources, they don't just watch snuff films, and we

1203
01:27:40,140 --> 01:27:41,980
know that's a huge industry.

1204
01:27:41,980 --> 01:27:43,840
They produce them.

1205
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:46,140
Let's put him back on screen.

1206
01:27:46,140 --> 01:27:51,940
International Business Times, Jimmy Sevelle's satanic sex ring claim, star worship the devil.

1207
01:27:51,940 --> 01:27:54,780
And all these top reporters are coming out and saying, yeah, he would just brag about

1208
01:27:54,780 --> 01:27:58,440
worshiping the devil, how he was with the royal family.

1209
01:27:58,440 --> 01:28:02,340
This is a guy who could get into the royal palaces, had his own keys and stuff.

1210
01:28:02,340 --> 01:28:05,820
Nobody got that.

1211
01:28:05,820 --> 01:28:07,020
And I mean, that's who they are.

1212
01:28:07,020 --> 01:28:08,020
That's who we're fighting.

1213
01:28:08,020 --> 01:28:10,220
I mean, I sit here and that's why I should be so serious.

1214
01:28:10,220 --> 01:28:13,940
I joke around and stuff because I can't be serious all the time, or I'd go crazy.

1215
01:28:13,940 --> 01:28:18,820
But I mean, yes, we're dealing with Satanists that want to torture children to death.

1216
01:28:18,820 --> 01:28:20,400
I mean, that's who we're fighting.

1217
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:22,380
That's who runs the government.

1218
01:28:22,380 --> 01:28:25,540
And if people don't get that, there's no future.

1219
01:28:25,540 --> 01:28:32,900
Yeah, yeah, just basically when I talk to people about this stuff, that's eventually

1220
01:28:32,900 --> 01:28:34,980
where I lead them to, and they don't wanna believe it.

1221
01:28:34,980 --> 01:28:38,460
And then when they find out for themselves, they're like, wow, this is really happening.

1222
01:28:38,460 --> 01:28:39,460
It's really in front of myself.

1223
01:28:39,460 --> 01:28:41,060
I want people to learn to see the look.

1224
01:28:41,060 --> 01:28:42,300
Punch it back up.

1225
01:28:42,300 --> 01:28:43,940
You see that guy?

1226
01:28:43,940 --> 01:28:45,260
I have been to the court cases.

1227
01:28:45,260 --> 01:28:46,720
I've covered it with a CPS.

1228
01:28:46,720 --> 01:28:48,080
Half of them look like that.

1229
01:28:48,080 --> 01:28:52,220
Men or women, black or white, they look just like that.

1230
01:28:52,220 --> 01:28:56,140
When you're possessed by whatever demon is in those people, that's what it looks like

1231
01:28:56,140 --> 01:28:57,780
on your screen if you're a TV viewer.

1232
01:28:57,780 --> 01:29:02,580
If you don't know who Jimmy Savelle is, just search engine it and get ready.

1233
01:29:02,580 --> 01:29:10,140
And let me tell you, ladies and gentlemen, that is a demon of hell, a demon of hell.

1234
01:29:10,140 --> 01:29:13,340
And the only reason this is all coming out right now is the EU's blackmailing the British

1235
01:29:13,340 --> 01:29:17,220
government to bring down England and put them into the EU.

1236
01:29:17,220 --> 01:29:21,060
Yeah, you didn't know that's why this is all coming out right now?

1237
01:29:21,060 --> 01:29:22,340
Even more even may come out.

1238
01:29:22,340 --> 01:29:25,260
They may come out on the news someday and say, yeah, we chop kids' heads off and drink

1239
01:29:25,260 --> 01:29:28,500
their blood as it sprays out of their, you know, stump.

1240
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:31,500
They'll be like, well, that's good, but I don't want to do that.

1241
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:35,000
Well, you're an extremist, you know, because the Aztecs cut kids' hearts out every day

1242
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:36,000
when the sun came up.

1243
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,700
And if you didn't think that was normal, they'd kill you.

1244
01:29:38,700 --> 01:29:39,900
You're like, but that's crazy.

1245
01:29:39,900 --> 01:29:43,620
No, when you're in the devil worshiper kingdom, you're crazy.

1246
01:29:43,620 --> 01:29:47,100
See those of us that don't like all this and are like, hey, you're not getting my guns,

1247
01:29:47,100 --> 01:29:48,100
devil worshippers.

1248
01:29:48,100 --> 01:29:49,100
They're like, you're mentally ill.

1249
01:29:49,100 --> 01:29:52,420
We're going to have to put you in solitary.

1250
01:29:52,420 --> 01:29:53,700
We're on the march.

1251
01:29:53,700 --> 01:29:56,100

1253
01:30:03,140 --> 01:30:08,140
Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive from natural disasters

1254
01:30:08,140 --> 01:30:12,720
like hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on

1255
01:30:12,720 --> 01:30:14,580
by a disastrous economy?

01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:28,540
After hurricane Sandy, Danny from New York city wrote, almost all of the grocery stores

1260
01:30:28,540 --> 01:30:33,360
are closed, but I managed to get my e foods just in time to be able to help my sister

and niece.

Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.

1282
01:32:05,340 --> 01:32:10,540
The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.

1283
01:32:10,540 --> 01:32:16,580
The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce

1284
01:32:16,580 --> 01:32:17,580
to the global takeover.

1285
01:32:17,580 --> 01:32:23,560

Are you infowarsoap.com

1297
01:33:29,540 --> 01:33:44,700
Michelle Dowry is in studio with us, ladies and gentlemen, and we'll queue up the Obama

1298
01:33:44,700 --> 01:33:52,820
phone famous audio video here in a moment for folks.

1299
01:33:52,820 --> 01:33:58,300
So new listeners who don't know who she is can get a idea and be reminded.

1300
01:33:58,300 --> 01:34:02,140
But when she flew into town last night, there were people at the airport taking photos shooting

1301
01:34:02,140 --> 01:34:04,100
video of her.

1302
01:34:04,100 --> 01:34:07,980
Also there were people when we went out to eat who were coming over wanting to take photographs

1303
01:34:07,980 --> 01:34:08,980
with her.

1304
01:34:08,980 --> 01:34:11,640
I mean, that's the power of YouTube.

1305
01:34:11,640 --> 01:34:15,620
And it wasn't just that it was somebody on there saying I want Obama to give me something.

1306
01:34:15,620 --> 01:34:17,280
There's plenty of videos like that.

1307
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:19,620
It's that she was interesting and she was funny.

1308
01:34:19,620 --> 01:34:28,420
And so people ask why did you bring Obama phone lady down to Austin, Texas to be in

1309
01:34:28,420 --> 01:34:30,380
studio with us?

1310
01:34:30,380 --> 01:34:34,340
And her husband as well, who we've had a chance to hang out with, Harvey.

1311
01:34:34,340 --> 01:34:38,060
We brought her down here because she's a phenomenon.

1312
01:34:38,060 --> 01:34:44,820
And I guess the way she disappeared from being an obvious Democratic Party canvasser disappearing

1313
01:34:44,820 --> 01:34:47,980
that they had put her up in an office and that is indeed what she told me last night

1314
01:34:47,980 --> 01:34:50,460
on video.

1315
01:34:50,460 --> 01:34:55,940
And I thought, hey, let's actually hear from the person, the real person, not just a short

1316
01:34:55,940 --> 01:34:56,940
clip.

1317
01:34:56,940 --> 01:35:01,780
Let's see what she really stands for, what she really believes in, just from a sociology

1318
01:35:01,780 --> 01:35:09,420
perspective to really understand what is in the mind of someone who really thinks Obama's

1319
01:35:09,420 --> 01:35:10,420
a great guy.

1320
01:35:10,420 --> 01:35:13,180
There are a lot of people that think Mitt Romney was a great guy.

1321
01:35:13,180 --> 01:35:15,460
I didn't like Mitt Romney either.

1322
01:35:15,460 --> 01:35:19,620
Her son thinks that I'm a Republican because I don't like Obama.

1323
01:35:19,620 --> 01:35:22,820
Whenever a Republican gets in office, people think I'm a Democrat because I don't like

1324
01:35:22,820 --> 01:35:23,820
it.

1325
01:35:23,820 --> 01:35:29,660
When Republican presidents are torturing and wars and all this, I just marvel at how when

1326
01:35:29,660 --> 01:35:34,780
somebody's guy is in office, be they Republican or Democrat, they suddenly switch off their

1327
01:35:34,780 --> 01:35:35,780
thinking process.

1328
01:35:35,780 --> 01:35:38,420
And if the other party was doing that, they'd be upset.

1329
01:35:38,420 --> 01:35:43,060
But because it's seen as their guy, well then everything is great.

1330
01:35:43,060 --> 01:35:47,420
But here is the Obama phone lady clip.

1331
01:35:47,420 --> 01:35:48,420
Here it is.

1332
01:35:48,420 --> 01:35:49,420
You got Obama phone?

1333
01:35:49,420 --> 01:35:50,420
Yes, everybody in Cleveland, low minority, got Obama phone.

1334
01:35:50,420 --> 01:35:51,420
Keep Obama in president, you know.

1335
01:35:51,420 --> 01:35:52,420
He gave us a phone.

1336
01:35:52,420 --> 01:35:53,420
He gave you a phone.

1337
01:35:53,420 --> 01:35:54,420
He's gonna do more.

1338
01:35:54,420 --> 01:35:55,420
How'd he give you a phone?

1339
01:35:55,420 --> 01:35:56,420
You sign up, you're on full stamps, you're on Social Security.

1340
01:35:56,420 --> 01:35:57,420
You got low income, you disability.

1341
01:35:57,420 --> 01:35:58,420
Hey, listen.

1342
01:35:58,420 --> 01:35:59,420
Okay, what's wrong with Romney again?

1343
01:35:59,420 --> 01:36:00,420
Romney, he sucks.

1344
01:36:00,420 --> 01:36:01,420
Hey.

1345
01:36:01,420 --> 01:36:14,020
Obama.

1346
01:36:14,020 --> 01:36:15,020
You got Obama phone?

1347
01:36:15,020 --> 01:36:16,020
Yes, everybody in Cleveland, low minority.

1348
01:36:16,020 --> 01:36:21,300
Okay, now she's gonna be with us for the next hour and 20 minutes, maybe even into overdrive.

1349
01:36:21,300 --> 01:36:24,820
And yes, ladies and gentlemen, I know we've got callers on other issues holding, but you

1350
01:36:24,820 --> 01:36:28,160
can address your question to myself.

1351
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:33,580
And of course, to Michelle Dowry, who is here in studio with us.

1352
01:36:33,580 --> 01:36:39,660
But first off, Michelle, I wanna commend you for having the courage to come down here.

1353
01:36:39,660 --> 01:36:42,460
Describe that thinking process and how that happened, and then tell people a little bit

1354
01:36:42,460 --> 01:36:43,460
about yourself.

1355
01:36:43,460 --> 01:36:48,420
Okay, you fans, my name is Michelle Dowry, I live in Cleveland, Ohio.

1356
01:36:48,420 --> 01:36:53,220
I work for the Obama campaign.

1357
01:36:53,220 --> 01:36:58,340
The campaign was over November 11th.

1358
01:36:58,340 --> 01:37:04,500
I went out and campaigned for Obama to get voters in to vote for Obama.

1359
01:37:04,500 --> 01:37:08,780
One thing I liked what I did, this was like my second year campaigning.

1360
01:37:08,780 --> 01:37:12,980
You know, he won this the second four years, the first four years I did it and it's the

1361
01:37:12,980 --> 01:37:13,980
second.

1362
01:37:13,980 --> 01:37:16,220
A lot of people didn't know about voting.

1363
01:37:16,220 --> 01:37:19,220
They thought if you had a warrant for your arrest, you couldn't vote.

1364
01:37:19,220 --> 01:37:22,560
I explained to them that had anything to do with it.

1365
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:28,180
Some people wanted to vote, thought if they go get an ID that the police will get them,

1366
01:37:28,180 --> 01:37:29,180
no.

1367
01:37:29,180 --> 01:37:35,580
We had people that wasn't from this country, but they had foreign IDs, which they've been

1368
01:37:35,580 --> 01:37:37,060
here two, three years.

1369
01:37:37,060 --> 01:37:42,300
They need to go change it over and get a state ID to vote.

1370
01:37:42,300 --> 01:37:46,860
It was very nice, very interesting what I did.

1371
01:37:46,860 --> 01:37:52,580
When you talk about people, US citizens that have been out of the country?

1372
01:37:52,580 --> 01:37:58,180
We had people that was from overseas, a few of them that didn't even have Ohio state ID

1373
01:37:58,180 --> 01:37:59,780
and been here two, three years.

1374
01:37:59,780 --> 01:38:02,460
So I explained- Were they US citizens?

1375
01:38:02,460 --> 01:38:04,300
Yeah, they were not from Ohio.

1376
01:38:04,300 --> 01:38:06,620
But they were US citizens.

1377
01:38:06,620 --> 01:38:10,580
They were US citizens now, but they didn't even take the effort to get their state ID

1378
01:38:10,580 --> 01:38:11,580
yet.

1379
01:38:11,580 --> 01:38:15,980
So I opened some doors for a couple of them people too, because once I told them how you

1380
01:38:15,980 --> 01:38:22,400
had to have a state ID and a vote, they went and got a state ID and they voted.

1381
01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:24,180
Let me be honest with you.

1382
01:38:24,180 --> 01:38:28,100
The first thing that pops in some listeners minds and the first thing that pops in my

1383
01:38:28,100 --> 01:38:33,420
wife's mind was, the Obama phone lady, don't be mean to her.

1384
01:38:33,420 --> 01:38:36,220
Obviously, I'm not here to get you here to be mean to you.

1385
01:38:36,220 --> 01:38:40,980
In fact, contrary to that, I would like to try to see if I can communicate with you and

1386
01:38:40,980 --> 01:38:48,340
actually show you the fact that Obama is just as bad as the Republicans, probably even worse,

1387
01:38:48,340 --> 01:38:52,220
and that he does not have your best interest at heart and he's an incredible liar.

1388
01:38:52,220 --> 01:38:54,220
But again, that's my view.

1389
01:38:54,220 --> 01:38:57,900
Tell us why you like Obama.

1390
01:38:57,900 --> 01:39:00,100
I liked Obama.

1391
01:39:00,100 --> 01:39:08,340
I had seen him last year when and some things have went on by me being a minority and didn't

1392
01:39:08,340 --> 01:39:10,340
know no better.

1393
01:39:10,340 --> 01:39:13,660
I know he really didn't set the phones off.

1394
01:39:13,660 --> 01:39:21,460
Once I spoke on that on YouTube, they showed me that it was passed, but when Obama got

1395
01:39:21,460 --> 01:39:26,140
an election, it was Obama phones.

1396
01:39:26,140 --> 01:39:27,140
That's how-

1397
01:39:27,140 --> 01:39:28,540
Well, they radically increased the funding.

1398
01:39:28,540 --> 01:39:29,540
Right.

1399
01:39:29,540 --> 01:39:33,100
But he didn't put that bill out for us to get the Obama phone.

1400
01:39:33,100 --> 01:39:34,380
That was Clinton, right?

1401
01:39:34,380 --> 01:39:35,380
Yes.

1402
01:39:35,380 --> 01:39:36,380
Okay.

1403
01:39:36,380 --> 01:39:38,740
Did you know that my mother now calls her phone the Obama phone?

1404
01:39:38,740 --> 01:39:41,940
Well, everybody in Cleveland calls them Obama phones.

1405
01:39:41,940 --> 01:39:44,100
If you look on, and this is weird-

1406
01:39:44,100 --> 01:39:47,180
No, we just call cell phones Obama phones now, period.

1407
01:39:47,180 --> 01:39:48,180
Well, that's not-

1408
01:39:48,180 --> 01:39:52,180
It's like people don't call search engines search engines, they call them Googles.

1409
01:39:52,180 --> 01:39:57,640
Well, I never knew about it till I applied and I got one.

1410
01:39:57,640 --> 01:40:00,060
So they are called Obama's phone.

1411
01:40:00,060 --> 01:40:01,700
He got the name for them, but he didn't-

1412
01:40:01,700 --> 01:40:04,020
How many Obama phones do you have?

1413
01:40:04,020 --> 01:40:05,020
One.

1414
01:40:05,020 --> 01:40:10,940
But my sister has four or five of them, so that's what really pressed me to get them

1415
01:40:10,940 --> 01:40:13,420
because I work, my sister don't work.

1416
01:40:13,420 --> 01:40:17,700
She have no kids, she got four or five, she got three or four Obama phones and don't pay

1417
01:40:17,700 --> 01:40:18,700
a bill.

1418
01:40:18,700 --> 01:40:22,140
Here I am, I got Revo and I pay every month.

1419
01:40:22,140 --> 01:40:28,220
Now expanding on that, do you see the danger of people getting to where they're dependent

1420
01:40:28,220 --> 01:40:29,220
on the government?

1421
01:40:29,220 --> 01:40:33,460
Yes, I do, even myself, but I'm coming out of it.

1422
01:40:33,460 --> 01:40:34,780
Well, you've got a job.

1423
01:40:34,780 --> 01:40:43,180
Yes, I got a job, I started the day after Christmas, 26th of December.

1424
01:40:43,180 --> 01:40:50,580
My issue is obviously government at some levels needs to be there as a safety net, but government,

1425
01:40:50,580 --> 01:40:54,100
and I can actually after the show today show you some of their statements, about 100 years

1426
01:40:54,100 --> 01:40:58,760
ago said, we need to take control of society, we're going to do it by making people dependent.

1427
01:40:58,760 --> 01:41:03,020
And they didn't set up welfare and stuff to help people, they set it up to control people.

1428
01:41:03,020 --> 01:41:04,020
Right, right.

1429
01:41:04,020 --> 01:41:05,020
And that's true.

1430
01:41:05,020 --> 01:41:08,820
I've seen that with my own eyes in Cleveland, in Ohio.

1431
01:41:08,820 --> 01:41:13,660
They set it up to control you and have some where they can feed back and get you right

1432
01:41:13,660 --> 01:41:14,660
in.

1433
01:41:14,660 --> 01:41:18,820
I'm one of the ones, I got a child that I get child support for.

1434
01:41:18,820 --> 01:41:24,140
And by me getting the child support, here it is, the child is 10 years old, the dad

1435
01:41:24,140 --> 01:41:28,420
been working off and on, and we're not getting any money.

1436
01:41:28,420 --> 01:41:30,980
And I'm asking the child support people, what you mean?

1437
01:41:30,980 --> 01:41:31,980
Here he is working.

1438
01:41:31,980 --> 01:41:35,460
We need to send the channel news people in there because here he is working and he keeps

1439
01:41:35,460 --> 01:41:38,460
saying they're taking the money out, but we ain't getting none.

1440
01:41:38,460 --> 01:41:41,160
And we haven't got any, he's 10 years old.

1441
01:41:41,160 --> 01:41:45,740
So here I am right now, where's Obama now?

1442
01:41:45,740 --> 01:41:51,940
Like one thing, I'm glad he won the elections, but I want to see what he going to do.

1443
01:41:51,940 --> 01:41:56,880
You told me that last night, what do you expect Obama to do?

1444
01:41:56,880 --> 01:41:58,820
What could he do?

1445
01:41:58,820 --> 01:41:59,820
What could he do?

1446
01:41:59,820 --> 01:42:00,820
He could do a lot.

1447
01:42:00,820 --> 01:42:06,180
He's staying with the plan on the 25th of January, but is he going to do it?

1448
01:42:06,180 --> 01:42:09,060
And I know they keep saying it takes time, it takes time, it takes time.

1449
01:42:09,060 --> 01:42:14,900
Only thing I've seen he did, they passed the election and people calling Obama phones,

1450
01:42:14,900 --> 01:42:18,220
but for others in Ohio, I haven't seen him do too much.

1451
01:42:18,220 --> 01:42:23,420
He haven't even put up his office on Lee and Harvard, he's supposed to be rebuilding it

1452
01:42:23,420 --> 01:42:24,420
and everything.

1453
01:42:24,420 --> 01:42:25,420
You haven't did that yet.

1454
01:42:25,420 --> 01:42:27,660
Let me ask you a question.

1455
01:42:27,660 --> 01:42:30,340
Have you noticed prices have gone up on most products?

1456
01:42:30,340 --> 01:42:31,340
Hell yeah.

1457
01:42:31,340 --> 01:42:35,420
Oh yeah, prices, gas, cigarettes.

1458
01:42:35,420 --> 01:42:37,700
Do you know what the private fellow reserve is?

1459
01:42:37,700 --> 01:42:38,820
No, I don't.

1460
01:42:38,820 --> 01:42:43,460
Well, this country was taken over in 1913 by offshore European banks, and they've been

1461
01:42:43,460 --> 01:42:48,060
devaluing the dollar ever since, but most of the devaluations happened in the last 15

1462
01:42:48,060 --> 01:42:49,620
years or so.

1463
01:42:49,620 --> 01:42:55,420
And Obama has got the printing presses turned up on high, but all that's doing is devaluing

1464
01:42:55,420 --> 01:42:56,420
the dollar.

1465
01:42:56,420 --> 01:43:02,700
So the president really can't do anything for the people long term.

1466
01:43:02,700 --> 01:43:06,420
Anything he does do will end up being turned towards bad.

1467
01:43:06,420 --> 01:43:09,180
That's the problem with big government, that's why it doesn't work.

1468
01:43:09,180 --> 01:43:11,220
I heard that too.

1469
01:43:11,220 --> 01:43:17,140
Did you know that in communities, in the black community, that quote illegitimacy, that is

1470
01:43:17,140 --> 01:43:21,740
the parents getting divorced or the dad never being there, was less than 10% back in the

1471
01:43:21,740 --> 01:43:23,420
50s and now it's over 90%?

1472
01:43:23,420 --> 01:43:24,420
Yeah.

1473
01:43:24,420 --> 01:43:28,020
I mean, the state has taken over, but it's not just the black community, it's happening

1474
01:43:28,020 --> 01:43:29,020
everywhere now.

1475
01:43:29,020 --> 01:43:30,020
Right.

1476
01:43:30,020 --> 01:43:35,780
I mean, it's like a plague, wherever government takes over, so I mean, what will more government

1477
01:43:35,780 --> 01:43:38,300
money do?

1478
01:43:38,300 --> 01:43:46,360
Well, what I look at it is, well, what government money do is nothing, it's not doing anything.

1479
01:43:46,360 --> 01:43:52,220
Here I am as a living sacrifice and they haven't did anything to me, feed us and get bigger

1480
01:43:52,220 --> 01:43:57,020
and bigger with the food stamps, father's cash, they've been stopped the cash.

1481
01:43:57,020 --> 01:44:01,140
So he's not really doing anything right now.

1482
01:44:01,140 --> 01:44:04,900
But how do we go from being able to feed the whole world 50 years ago to where we can't

1483
01:44:04,900 --> 01:44:06,980
even produce our own food now?

1484
01:44:06,980 --> 01:44:10,820
See, globalism is poverty.

1485
01:44:10,820 --> 01:44:16,220
The policy is poverty, they want to make you poor so that they can control you.

1486
01:44:16,220 --> 01:44:20,180
Do you know how horses got domesticated?

1487
01:44:20,180 --> 01:44:21,700
Do you know how pigs got domesticated?

1488
01:44:21,700 --> 01:44:25,340
Do you know how cows got domesticated?

1489
01:44:25,340 --> 01:44:27,380
No, I don't.

1490
01:44:27,380 --> 01:44:31,140
Well, it's the same way we're becoming domesticated.

1491
01:44:31,140 --> 01:44:34,740
You simply set up an area and start putting food out for them, then they get used to eating

1492
01:44:34,740 --> 01:44:37,860
it, then you put a fence up around it but leave a gate open, then they start going in,

1493
01:44:37,860 --> 01:44:40,060
then you just go close the gate one day.

1494
01:44:40,060 --> 01:44:43,540
Then you make them come to you when they're starving to get the food.

1495
01:44:43,540 --> 01:44:47,380
And pretty soon you're on a spit being basically roasted.

1496
01:44:47,380 --> 01:44:50,660
That's being sent off to fight illegal wars.

1497
01:44:50,660 --> 01:44:57,820
Here's an example, to get welfare, in a lot of states they try to force you to take vaccines.

1498
01:44:57,820 --> 01:44:59,940
Do you know folks that are on welfare?

1499
01:44:59,940 --> 01:45:00,940
Yes.

1500
01:45:00,940 --> 01:45:03,580
Do they tell you that you've got to take vaccines?

1501
01:45:03,580 --> 01:45:04,580
No.

1502
01:45:04,580 --> 01:45:05,580
They don't?

1503
01:45:05,580 --> 01:45:06,580
No.

1504
01:45:06,580 --> 01:45:07,580
Do you take vaccines?

1505
01:45:07,580 --> 01:45:08,580
No.

1506
01:45:08,580 --> 01:45:09,580
You don't?

1507
01:45:09,580 --> 01:45:10,580
No.

1508
01:45:10,580 --> 01:45:11,580
Why?

1509
01:45:11,580 --> 01:45:12,580
Vaccines?

1510
01:45:12,580 --> 01:45:13,580
Yes.

1511
01:45:13,580 --> 01:45:14,580
Fascination shots?

1512
01:45:14,580 --> 01:45:15,580
Yeah.

1513
01:45:15,580 --> 01:45:16,580
Because I had all my shots.

1514
01:45:16,580 --> 01:45:22,260
What would you say if I told you that they put all sorts of deadly things in those shots?

1515
01:45:22,260 --> 01:45:24,900
Well, that's now.

1516
01:45:24,900 --> 01:45:28,100
I'm a little older, so I won't need no vaccination shots.

1517
01:45:28,100 --> 01:45:30,620
Well, they are starting to try to make adults take them.

1518
01:45:30,620 --> 01:45:32,700
Do you know about the Tuskegee experiments?

1519
01:45:32,700 --> 01:45:35,660
Where they put them in animals or something?

1520
01:45:35,660 --> 01:45:39,140
Hold on, I've got my phone going off here.

1521
01:45:39,140 --> 01:45:41,980
Got my Obama phone going off right here.

1522
01:45:41,980 --> 01:45:46,100
Anyways, now we're having a serious interview here all of a sudden.

1523
01:45:46,100 --> 01:45:47,900
You were pretty wound up last night, so was I.

1524
01:45:47,900 --> 01:45:49,860
I am still wound up.

1525
01:45:49,860 --> 01:45:53,060
Look, I've got so many questions here that I could ask.

1526
01:45:53,060 --> 01:45:55,220
I know we've got so many callers on so many fronts.

1527
01:45:55,220 --> 01:45:58,700
Let me just give you one example right here because I'm not here to beat you up because

1528
01:45:58,700 --> 01:45:59,860
you're an Obama supporter.

1529
01:45:59,860 --> 01:46:07,060
I mean, I get the argument of, well, the Republicans, they're torture, secret arrest, wars, lying,

1530
01:46:07,060 --> 01:46:10,940
corporate welfare, banker bailouts.

1531
01:46:10,940 --> 01:46:13,380
At least Obama says he wants to help me.

1532
01:46:13,380 --> 01:46:17,540
My issue is, did you hear how they paid $22 billion to ship General Motors Cadillac and

1533
01:46:17,540 --> 01:46:19,340
Volt plants to China?

1534
01:46:19,340 --> 01:46:23,780
Now, I mean, it's one thing if they left the country.

1535
01:46:23,780 --> 01:46:26,380
We paid to make them leave.

1536
01:46:26,380 --> 01:46:27,780
And there's hundreds of things like that.

1537
01:46:27,780 --> 01:46:31,820
Did you know Obama, Congress wouldn't pass a law that he's shutting down our coal power

1538
01:46:31,820 --> 01:46:36,580
plants and power prices are going up everywhere?

1539
01:46:36,580 --> 01:46:38,140
You know why that is?

1540
01:46:38,140 --> 01:46:39,140
No.

1541
01:46:39,140 --> 01:46:41,460
People, I don't know.

1542
01:46:41,460 --> 01:46:42,920
No, I don't.

1543
01:46:42,920 --> 01:46:49,460
My point is, Obama is a front man for some very dangerous criminal organizations.

1544
01:46:49,460 --> 01:46:50,900
Have you heard of the New World Order?

1545
01:46:50,900 --> 01:46:53,380
A little bit, I heard you talking.

1546
01:46:53,380 --> 01:46:56,420
Okay, these are people that want you dead.

1547
01:46:56,420 --> 01:46:59,980
Have you heard about the tens of thousands of experiments killing US troops, killing

1548
01:46:59,980 --> 01:47:00,980
foster children?

1549
01:47:00,980 --> 01:47:02,300
Yeah, I heard about it.

1550
01:47:02,300 --> 01:47:05,620
Yeah, I mean, they admit, they want you to know all day, we're the government, we kill

1551
01:47:05,620 --> 01:47:06,620
you.

1552
01:47:06,620 --> 01:47:07,620
Right.

1553
01:47:07,620 --> 01:47:09,860
Did you hear about the thousands of black people injected with syphilis?

1554
01:47:09,860 --> 01:47:10,860
Yeah.

1555
01:47:10,860 --> 01:47:11,860
That's Tuskegee.

1556
01:47:11,860 --> 01:47:12,860
Right.

1557
01:47:12,860 --> 01:47:16,700
And the reason I raised that, not cuz you're black, but because people have heard of that.

1558
01:47:16,700 --> 01:47:17,700
Right.

1559
01:47:17,700 --> 01:47:21,220
That was a 50 year program, okay, and nobody got in trouble for that.

1560
01:47:21,220 --> 01:47:22,220
Right.

1561
01:47:22,220 --> 01:47:28,260
Did you know the UN gave millions of kids in India vaccines last year and 60 plus thousand

1562
01:47:28,260 --> 01:47:30,260
of them got paralyzed?

1563
01:47:30,260 --> 01:47:34,620
I mean, those kids are never gonna run and play again, they're paralyzed, a lot of them

1564
01:47:34,620 --> 01:47:35,620
died.

1565
01:47:35,620 --> 01:47:37,420
Now, did you know they put that in the back of the paper like it was like they were talking

1566
01:47:37,420 --> 01:47:41,340
about the price of gasoline or something?

1567
01:47:41,340 --> 01:47:46,460
Now, why would the government put US troops in chambers and nerve gas them to death?

1568
01:47:46,460 --> 01:47:47,700
Guys hadn't done anything.

1569
01:47:47,700 --> 01:47:48,700
Right.

1570
01:47:48,700 --> 01:47:49,700
Black, white, kill you.

1571
01:47:49,700 --> 01:47:50,700
Mm-hm.

1572
01:47:50,700 --> 01:47:51,700
Why would we trust them?

1573
01:47:51,700 --> 01:47:54,980
In a way, I really don't.

1574
01:47:54,980 --> 01:48:01,460
As I'm a living sacrifice now here in America, and I did all this work for the help with

1575
01:48:01,460 --> 01:48:02,460
Obama.

1576
01:48:02,460 --> 01:48:07,060
You got paid a dollar sign nice and everything, but four years ago, he said what he was gonna

1577
01:48:07,060 --> 01:48:10,460
do and he still ain't dead, why is it taking so long?

1578
01:48:10,460 --> 01:48:15,940
He said the mothers that like me got kids, a 10 and a 15 year old, how should if I don't

1579
01:48:15,940 --> 01:48:20,140
have a job just getting food stamps, how could I live, how could I pay my rent?

1580
01:48:20,140 --> 01:48:24,620
You know, and these are people that press for you to win.

1581
01:48:24,620 --> 01:48:28,980
You know, and then I look at him like he'd be in a black president, at least he looked

1582
01:48:28,980 --> 01:48:33,620
out for the black minority who got you in this chair.

1583
01:48:33,620 --> 01:48:38,780
You know, cuz even with me doing what I did, you know, by being a lot of big shot white

1584
01:48:38,780 --> 01:48:44,780
guys around, they didn't really want to see me go from canvassing on the streets to an

1585
01:48:44,780 --> 01:48:46,180
office job.

1586
01:48:46,180 --> 01:48:52,080
Do you know right before it was over, they gave me that job in office maybe a week or

1587
01:48:52,080 --> 01:48:56,660
two at the last minute after I had already walked five or six miles?

1588
01:48:56,660 --> 01:48:58,740
Well, see, here's the thing, you're a really nice lady.

1589
01:48:58,740 --> 01:49:05,760
The way you described it to me, tell folks, I mean, tell us how they called you in after

1590
01:49:05,760 --> 01:49:08,300
the Obama phone video went viral.

1591
01:49:08,300 --> 01:49:11,060
I mean, describe that because you told me last night.

1592
01:49:11,060 --> 01:49:16,940
Okay, well, when I got the job that I was doing walking in the field service, they called

1593
01:49:16,940 --> 01:49:20,980
me in the office and they was like, do you know how you showed your ass?

1594
01:49:20,980 --> 01:49:26,060
You know how I really talked to the cameraman and I said what I said.

1595
01:49:26,060 --> 01:49:29,020
And I said, I said the first thing came to my heart.

1596
01:49:29,020 --> 01:49:31,720
And he was like, do you know that Obama didn't get the phone?

1597
01:49:31,720 --> 01:49:33,620
It don't matter.

1598
01:49:33,620 --> 01:49:39,780
You are walking around, even you, the job that I got, the phone you gave me say Obama.

1599
01:49:39,780 --> 01:49:44,740
So if this is all what we see and know, this is what people think of that.

1600
01:49:44,740 --> 01:49:46,220
And then you told me they put you in the office.

1601
01:49:46,220 --> 01:49:47,820
They gave me an office job.

1602
01:49:47,820 --> 01:49:49,200
So that you wouldn't be on the street.

1603
01:49:49,200 --> 01:49:50,200
That I wouldn't be on the street.

1604
01:49:50,200 --> 01:49:52,100
And then what did they tell you about that?

1605
01:49:52,100 --> 01:49:55,980
Well, when I got in the office job, they told me they didn't want me on the street because

1606
01:49:55,980 --> 01:49:59,060
I had so many voters for Obama.

1607
01:49:59,060 --> 01:50:03,520
You know, I was really going out there talking and knew because at the end of the day, turning

1608
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:07,680
your paperwork, I got over 75 to 100 people.

1609
01:50:07,680 --> 01:50:11,100
But do you really believe you did such a good job, we pulled you off it?

1610
01:50:11,100 --> 01:50:12,100
Right.

1611
01:50:12,100 --> 01:50:13,100
But I don't believe that.

1612
01:50:13,100 --> 01:50:16,340
I believe they pulled me off because he was full of stuff too.

1613
01:50:16,340 --> 01:50:20,740
Well, but see, the difference is here with me, Michelle, is I'm talking to you straight.

1614
01:50:20,740 --> 01:50:21,740
Right.

1615
01:50:21,740 --> 01:50:24,820
See, I don't see you as a human resource to be used.

1616
01:50:24,820 --> 01:50:25,820
Right.

1617
01:50:25,820 --> 01:50:29,940
I see you as a real person who has incredible potential.

1618
01:50:29,940 --> 01:50:30,940
Right.

1619
01:50:30,940 --> 01:50:35,300
And I want you to know that I have Margaret Sanger and all the documents where they said

1620
01:50:35,300 --> 01:50:38,800
about 100 years ago, they said, we're going to go in and take over the black community.

1621
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:43,300
We're going to hire their leaders and we're going to get abortion legalized so we can

1622
01:50:43,300 --> 01:50:44,540
kill these people.

1623
01:50:44,540 --> 01:50:49,620
The Democratic Party exists to put you six feet under.

1624
01:50:49,620 --> 01:50:53,580
The Republicans are a bunch of gangsters too, but the Democrats, a modern Democratic Party

1625
01:50:53,580 --> 01:50:55,860
is designed to kill black people.

1626
01:50:55,860 --> 01:50:56,860
We'll be right back.

1627
01:50:56,860 --> 01:50:57,860
Okay.

1628
01:50:57,860 --> 01:50:58,860
All right.

1629
01:50:58,860 --> 01:51:10,660
You land in Buenos Aires, then a shuttle to Santa Rosa, where a nicely furnished cabin

1630
01:51:10,660 --> 01:51:16,780
with all amenities, Wi-Fi, executive food and wine and laundry service awaits.

1631
01:51:16,780 --> 01:51:19,660
After a good night's sleep, your adventure begins.

1632
01:51:19,660 --> 01:51:24,580
You're on a golden stag safari for big game.

1633
01:51:24,580 --> 01:51:25,900
But it's not Africa.

1634
01:51:25,900 --> 01:51:26,900
It's Argentina.

1635
01:51:26,900 --> 01:51:33,740
One-on-one guided hunts for water buffalo, huger, bighorn rams, wild boar, and the biggest

1636
01:51:33,740 --> 01:51:41,380
stag deer in South America, all gold medal quality, all the action you can handle.

1637
01:51:41,380 --> 01:51:46,740
Land rovers, top rental guns with scopes, all food, beverages, hunting guides, ground

1638
01:51:46,740 --> 01:51:52,260
transportation included, and more, all more affordable than you can imagine.

1639
01:51:52,260 --> 01:51:57,380
The adventure of a lifetime starts at goldenstagsafaris.com.

1640
01:51:57,380 --> 01:52:01,380
The big game hunting ranch, goldenstagsafaris.com.

1641
01:52:01,380 --> 01:52:11,540
Balance, harmony, mental alertness, physical wellbeing.

1642
01:52:11,540 --> 01:52:16,940
If once you possess these qualities, but stress now weighs you down, you can get your mental

1652
01:53:02,720 --> 01:53:03,940
My name is Stephen Heuer.

1653
01:53:03,940 --> 01:53:07,740
After 22 years of nutritional counseling, I've observed that most brain malfunctions

1654
01:53:07,740 --> 01:53:11,160
have at their roots some form of toxicity and brain damage.

1655
01:53:11,160 --> 01:53:15,020
So whether it is poor memory, poor focus, lack of creative thinking, or more serious

1656
01:53:15,020 --> 01:53:19,540
matters like inability to focus, speak normally, or remember things, the emphasis to getting

1657
01:53:19,540 --> 01:53:23,220
one's brain working optimally needs to be on detoxification.

1658
01:53:23,220 --> 01:53:27,620
One World Way supports your body's number one means of detoxification, which is glutathione

1659
01:53:27,620 --> 01:53:28,620
production.

1660
01:53:28,620 --> 01:53:33,020
My name is Angie, and my son has suffered from borderline autism and constipation.

1661
01:53:33,020 --> 01:53:37,380
I got him on One World Way, and in two months, his constipation is gone.

1662
01:53:37,380 --> 01:53:41,540
He's become friendlier, he can carry on a normal conversation with me, and he has made

1663
01:53:41,540 --> 01:53:42,540
his first friend.

1664
01:53:42,540 --> 01:53:46,540
He's doing great, and he looks forward to taking One World Way every day.

1665
01:53:46,540 --> 01:53:51,540
You could offer him a present or a cake, and he would prefer the One World Way.

1666
01:53:51,540 --> 01:54:16,420
Go to OneWorldWay.com, that's OneWorldW-H-E-Y.com, or call 888-988-3325, that's 888-988-3325.

1667
01:54:16,420 --> 01:54:21,700
She was their old Obama phone lady self.

1668
01:54:21,700 --> 01:54:24,820
Michelle Dowry is here with us in the studio, a whole other hour coming up, and we will

1669
01:54:24,820 --> 01:54:29,340
also open the phones up as well.

1670
01:54:29,340 --> 01:54:38,220
But continuing here, I sent the guys over to McDonald's to get a Happy Meal, because,

1671
01:54:38,220 --> 01:54:41,380
and I don't do this to be condescending, I do this to get it all out in the open.

1672
01:54:41,380 --> 01:54:43,300
Wow, that's where I've never seen a Happy Meal where it's torn open.

1673
01:54:43,300 --> 01:54:47,180
My son must have been in this, seeing it's designed to get kids to go after it.

1674
01:54:47,180 --> 01:54:49,860
But it's the same thing with adults.

1675
01:54:49,860 --> 01:54:57,220
A free phone, it's like Indians selling Manhattan for a box full of glass beads that didn't

1676
01:54:57,220 --> 01:55:02,520
even cost half a pound, or British sterling.

1677
01:55:02,520 --> 01:55:04,620
It's selling your birthright for baubles.

1678
01:55:04,620 --> 01:55:08,500
The government shouldn't be the place we're getting phones from.

1679
01:55:08,500 --> 01:55:11,380
The government, guys, I don't think that door is completely shut.

1680
01:55:11,380 --> 01:55:17,340
Can we shut that door completely, thank you.

1681
01:55:17,340 --> 01:55:20,700
This is the type of issue that we're dealing with here.

1682
01:55:20,700 --> 01:55:25,760
And it is an artificial system.

1683
01:55:25,760 --> 01:55:33,140
Not only is this meant to lure kids in, bunch of GMO crud with Monsanto on the board of

1684
01:55:33,140 --> 01:55:35,040
this organization.

1685
01:55:35,040 --> 01:55:38,700
And it's a Happy Meal, but really what it is, is a spider's web.

1686
01:55:38,700 --> 01:55:45,940
So here's my issue, that's the same thing with the Obama phone, it's like a Happy Meal.

1687
01:55:45,940 --> 01:55:49,620
In fact, you've got the Obama phone right there, don't you?

1688
01:55:49,620 --> 01:55:50,620
Yes, sir.

1689
01:55:50,620 --> 01:55:53,820
It's like Excalibur, hold it up for the camera, people can see that.

1690
01:55:53,820 --> 01:55:57,340
There it is, ladies and gentlemen.

1691
01:55:57,340 --> 01:56:02,440
And again, just to be clear about this, the Republicans out there, half of them work for

1692
01:56:02,440 --> 01:56:05,540
defense contractors, they're getting government money too.

1693
01:56:05,540 --> 01:56:09,060
I'm not here judging you because you want an Obama phone.

1694
01:56:09,060 --> 01:56:10,500
What about all the corporate welfare?

1695
01:56:10,500 --> 01:56:12,520
What about the trillions in banker bailouts?

1696
01:56:12,520 --> 01:56:17,300
Did you know for every dollar that went to banker bailouts, they had like $1 in welfare?

1697
01:56:17,300 --> 01:56:23,480
Again, if we are gonna have a socialist system, the people are sure selling out cheap.

1698
01:56:23,480 --> 01:56:26,380
Why didn't you like Romney?

1699
01:56:26,380 --> 01:56:28,340
Romney was gonna take the food stamps.

1700
01:56:28,340 --> 01:56:34,860
He was gonna take the stamps, he was gonna make us work for the food stamps.

1701
01:56:34,860 --> 01:56:35,860
What else he said he was gonna do?

1702
01:56:35,860 --> 01:56:39,580
He was gonna cut our hours back.

1703
01:56:39,580 --> 01:56:47,920
In Ohio, they got the cameras, he was up on the camera with the speeding and Romney was

1704
01:56:47,920 --> 01:56:49,180
really on it.

1705
01:56:49,180 --> 01:56:53,320
I mean, Obama is continuing and expanding NSA spying.

1706
01:56:53,320 --> 01:56:57,620
Obama has signed a law where they can secretly disappear American citizens and even kill

1707
01:56:57,620 --> 01:56:59,900
us called the NDAA.

1708
01:56:59,900 --> 01:57:01,820
He's got drone attacks going on all over the world.

1709
01:57:01,820 --> 01:57:04,300
Again, I'm not saying Romney's good either.

1710
01:57:04,300 --> 01:57:08,260
My point is they're all really bad and Obama isn't your friend.

1711
01:57:08,260 --> 01:57:13,860
What do you think of Obama continuing torture?

1712
01:57:13,860 --> 01:57:16,020
What do I think he's continuing to torture?

1713
01:57:16,020 --> 01:57:18,020
Is that what you said?

1714
01:57:18,020 --> 01:57:21,620
Yes, I mean, are you aware of his foreign policy?

1715
01:57:21,620 --> 01:57:24,540
A little bit.

1716
01:57:24,540 --> 01:57:30,300
My point is that, I mean, do you think torture is okay?

1717
01:57:30,300 --> 01:57:32,420
No.

1718
01:57:32,420 --> 01:57:34,420
What about drone attacks?

1719
01:57:34,420 --> 01:57:35,420
No.

1720
01:57:35,420 --> 01:57:36,420
Where they're just bombing.

1721
01:57:36,420 --> 01:57:38,860
And by the way, the countries where they're bombing, it's illegal.

1722
01:57:38,860 --> 01:57:40,540
There's no declaration of war.

1723
01:57:40,540 --> 01:57:43,800
They're just flying around killing wherever they want.

1724
01:57:43,800 --> 01:57:47,780
Do you think Obama really cried on TV for the dead kids at Sandy Hook?

1725
01:57:47,780 --> 01:57:48,780
No.

1726
01:57:48,780 --> 01:57:51,260
Do you think it was fake?

1727
01:57:51,260 --> 01:57:56,080
A little bit, I mean, he got to play his part.

1728
01:57:56,080 --> 01:57:57,080
He's the president.

1729
01:57:57,080 --> 01:58:02,540
I mean, if he goes out and cry to every little situation, hell, he wouldn't have no tears

1730
01:58:02,540 --> 01:58:03,540
left.

1731
01:58:03,540 --> 01:58:06,300
He got to play his part too.

1732
01:58:06,300 --> 01:58:09,060
The whole world is a stage, each of his players upon it?

1733
01:58:09,060 --> 01:58:10,060
No.

1734
01:58:10,060 --> 01:58:12,380
I'm not going to agree on that one.

1735
01:58:12,380 --> 01:58:15,060
But you're saying, here's the deal, I don't play my part.

1736
01:58:15,060 --> 01:58:18,340
I mean, if I cry, I really am crying.

1737
01:58:18,340 --> 01:58:21,860
My point is they'll kill hundreds of innocent people at a wedding to get one bad guy they

1738
01:58:21,860 --> 01:58:23,860
claim.

1739
01:58:23,860 --> 01:58:25,940
And Obama doesn't cry for all those little kids.

1740
01:58:25,940 --> 01:58:29,380
Have you seen the video of little kids in Libya and Syria with their lower jaws blown

1741
01:58:29,380 --> 01:58:31,580
off and stuff, screaming for mommy?

1742
01:58:31,580 --> 01:58:32,580
Right.

1743
01:58:32,580 --> 01:58:34,060
Why is Obama crying for them?

1744
01:58:34,060 --> 01:58:37,420
Well, he probably felt sad and moved on.

1745
01:58:37,420 --> 01:58:39,020
But I think he could have did more.

1746
01:58:39,020 --> 01:58:40,420
Well, he is doing more.

1747
01:58:40,420 --> 01:58:41,420
He's bombing more countries.

1748
01:58:41,420 --> 01:58:42,420

01:58:55,860 --> 01:58:57,080
Go plastic.

1752
01:58:57,080 --> 01:58:58,620
Don't be one of them.

SuperNatural Silver is safe enough to consume every day while powerful enough to destroy

the causes of many serious diseases such as stress, strep, pneumonia, coals, flus and

1760
01:59:23,740 --> 01:59:25,340
other harmful pathogens.

1761
01:59:25,340 --> 01:59:30,200
This new technology has the ability to terminate entire colonies of harmful bacteria at several

1762
01:59:30,200 --> 01:59:34,340
hundred times the effectiveness of colloidal or ionic silver solutions.

The Science Digest Journal says silver is our mightiest germ fighter.

1764
01:59:38,020 --> 01:59:41,860
It is virtually non-toxic and is emerging as a wonder of modern medicine.

Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCM radio network.

1768
02:00:07,900 --> 02:00:12,780
Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.

1769
02:00:12,780 --> 02:00:13,780
You want answers?

1770
02:00:13,780 --> 02:00:15,900
Well, so does he.

1771
02:00:15,900 --> 02:00:20,100
He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.

1772
02:00:20,100 --> 02:00:23,860
And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.

1773
02:00:23,860 --> 02:00:28,620
I thought it would be fun to get the Obama phone lady in studio.

1774
02:00:28,620 --> 02:00:35,180
No one knew who she was, there was that one video, then she disappeared off the radar

1775
02:00:35,180 --> 02:00:36,180
screen.

1776
02:00:36,180 --> 02:00:38,980
Well, she's now down here with us in Austin, Texas.

1777
02:00:38,980 --> 02:00:40,380
We had a great time last night.

1778
02:00:40,380 --> 02:00:43,620
I don't want to say you're nervous, but you're real serious now.

1779
02:00:43,620 --> 02:00:45,900
During the breaks, you've been having a little bit more fun.

1780
02:00:45,900 --> 02:00:46,900
I want to go to some phone calls.

1781
02:00:46,900 --> 02:00:52,300
I want to go to a bunch of Twitter questions, a big stack of them that have also come in

1782
02:00:52,300 --> 02:00:53,300
here.

1783
02:00:53,300 --> 02:00:57,180
And I've got a bunch of other points I want to go over with you here today.

1784
02:00:57,180 --> 02:01:04,940
But you were talking about the hope that Obama will do things that will make your life, other

1785
02:01:04,940 --> 02:01:05,940
people's lives, better.

1786
02:01:05,940 --> 02:01:08,420
There's certainly nothing wrong with wanting a better life.

1787
02:01:08,420 --> 02:01:10,180
What do you think Obama can do?

1788
02:01:10,180 --> 02:01:12,540
He can do anything he want to do.

1789
02:01:12,540 --> 02:01:13,540
He's the president.

1790
02:01:13,540 --> 02:01:17,020
It might take a little time, but he can do anything.

1791
02:01:17,020 --> 02:01:23,180
The president, he wanted to build me a house from the ground, he could do that.

1792
02:01:23,180 --> 02:01:24,340
He's the president.

1793
02:01:24,340 --> 02:01:27,180
But he would have to take it from somebody else to do it.

1794
02:01:27,180 --> 02:01:28,180
Right?

1795
02:01:28,180 --> 02:01:29,180
That's like anybody else.

1796
02:01:29,180 --> 02:01:32,480
And then he would have to choose who got to build it, and of course, that'll be his friends.

1797
02:01:32,480 --> 02:01:36,900
But that's okay, he's the president, he got that pool to do whatever he can do to go that

1798
02:01:36,900 --> 02:01:37,900
Obama file.

1799
02:01:37,900 --> 02:01:39,900
Go ahead and take it.

1800
02:01:39,900 --> 02:01:43,060
All right there, hello?

1801
02:01:43,060 --> 02:01:45,100
I'm on the air, I can't talk to you guys.

1802
02:01:45,100 --> 02:01:47,900
My minutes are up my Obama phone.

1803
02:01:47,900 --> 02:01:55,620
Continue, so but don't you get that kings and presidents and others would say just do

1804
02:01:55,620 --> 02:01:57,460
it before, and it's called tyranny.

1805
02:01:57,460 --> 02:02:01,240
I mean, there's got to be rules that the president just can't do whatever he wants.

1806
02:02:01,240 --> 02:02:02,240
That's true.

1807
02:02:02,240 --> 02:02:08,060
He's the president, can't do everything he wants to do, but you know.

1808
02:02:08,060 --> 02:02:09,060
Did you see all the people?

1809
02:02:09,060 --> 02:02:10,060
Well, we'll talk about it later.

1810
02:02:10,060 --> 02:02:11,560
Let's take some phone calls right now.

1811
02:02:11,560 --> 02:02:18,340
Ryan in Texas, you were on the phone with the real live Obama phone lady, go ahead.

1812
02:02:18,340 --> 02:02:26,980
I was wanting to really know what deep down made you support Obama.

1813
02:02:26,980 --> 02:02:28,740
Deep down, why does she support Obama?

1814
02:02:28,740 --> 02:02:33,700
Yes, like the core reason why that makes her support Obama.

1815
02:02:33,700 --> 02:02:36,820
I mean, is it reflected, Glory?

1816
02:02:36,820 --> 02:02:40,580
Is it that you feel like you're part of something?

1817
02:02:40,580 --> 02:02:43,500
No, I didn't feel like I was part of anything.

1818
02:02:43,500 --> 02:02:45,580
I had a job to do.

1819
02:02:45,580 --> 02:02:51,780
Now I got a job, I'm making a little money, and when I did the campaign for Obama, I made

1820
02:02:51,780 --> 02:02:52,780
the big money.

1821
02:02:52,780 --> 02:02:59,820
But as I was out there campaigning to get voters to vote for Obama, one thing I pressed

1822
02:02:59,820 --> 02:03:02,180
was what kind of phone you got?

1823
02:03:02,180 --> 02:03:05,040
And it was like Obama phone, how you get it?

1824
02:03:05,040 --> 02:03:06,800
They didn't know like I didn't know.

1825
02:03:06,800 --> 02:03:12,060
So that was wrong led me to get them out there for the vote.

1826
02:03:12,060 --> 02:03:15,220
But if you really look at it, if you got a quarter, you ain't saying where the quarter

1827
02:03:15,220 --> 02:03:17,380
come from, it's just a quarter.

1828
02:03:17,380 --> 02:03:18,860
Just like the phones, they were free.

1829
02:03:18,860 --> 02:03:23,900
No, I understand, it's Pavlovian, I mean, the government is giving you something, therefore

1830
02:03:23,900 --> 02:03:25,460
it must be good.

1831
02:03:25,460 --> 02:03:30,260
But take your job you've got now, did you know the payroll taxes just went way up?

1832
02:03:30,260 --> 02:03:31,660
The amount of money they're taking out of your check?

1833
02:03:31,660 --> 02:03:33,540
Remember Obama said he wouldn't raise your taxes.

1834
02:03:33,540 --> 02:03:37,700
No, I didn't, I haven't got a check yet.

1835
02:03:37,700 --> 02:03:40,860
Well listen, we're gonna have to try to work this out cuz I'd like you to do some auxiliary

1836
02:03:40,860 --> 02:03:41,860
reporting for us.

1837
02:03:41,860 --> 02:03:47,920
But I first have to get you to the point where you understand, I mean, everybody's heard

1838
02:03:47,920 --> 02:03:50,180
about government doing medical experiments on people.

1839
02:03:50,180 --> 02:03:52,620
Caller, did you have anything else you wanted to add?

1840
02:03:52,620 --> 02:03:57,980
Yeah, I was also wanting to know her views on the gun control bill they're trying to

1841
02:03:57,980 --> 02:03:58,980
pass.

1842
02:03:58,980 --> 02:04:03,180
I'm gonna ask her that when we come back from break because that's a big one and I wanna

1843
02:04:03,180 --> 02:04:05,580
I want everybody to be able to respond to that.

1844
02:04:05,580 --> 02:04:08,620
When we come back from break, we'll get into the gun situation, I asked her about that

1845
02:04:08,620 --> 02:04:09,620
last night.

1846
02:04:09,620 --> 02:04:11,360
And we'll get to some of these Twitter questions as well.

1847
02:04:11,360 --> 02:04:12,360
Thank you for the call, Ryan.

1848
02:04:12,360 --> 02:04:17,140
We're gonna go to Jerry and others also on the other side of this quick break and she's

1849
02:04:17,140 --> 02:04:18,140
with us.

1850
02:04:18,140 --> 02:04:24,260
Michelle Dowry is in studio with us and she is the Obama phone lady.

1851
02:04:24,260 --> 02:04:28,700
And if you wanna see the quintessential Obama voter, I think she represents it.

1852
02:04:28,700 --> 02:04:32,740
She's a nice lady and I understand that this country's in a depression.

1853
02:04:32,740 --> 02:04:38,820
When you get to a point where the government is there providing for you, you start having

1854
02:04:38,820 --> 02:04:39,820
allegiance for it.

1855
02:04:39,820 --> 02:04:43,780
So pretty soon the government takes from one group, gives to another, they've got them

1856
02:04:43,780 --> 02:04:46,940
in a subsistence level, there's no real economy left.

1857
02:04:46,940 --> 02:04:50,140
Everybody's on the government plantation and game over, the globalists win.

1858
02:04:50,140 --> 02:04:54,420
We'll come right back with the one, the only, the Obama phone lady is very, very somber

1859
02:04:54,420 --> 02:04:55,420
in here.

1860
02:04:55,420 --> 02:04:57,100
And we've got a lot of video of her behind the scenes.

1861
02:04:57,100 --> 02:04:59,100
She's a crackerjack.

1862
02:04:59,100 --> 02:05:07,180
Sick of the globalist, eugenicist, control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing

1863
02:05:07,180 --> 02:05:08,900
as you get sick and die?

1864
02:05:08,900 --> 02:05:11,100
Start purifying your water with ProPure.

1865
02:05:11,100 --> 02:05:15,660
My friends, I've done a lot of research and the best gravity filter out there bar none

Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%, easy to set up and use, doesn't

1871
02:05:32,940 --> 02:05:37,380
require electricity, purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.

1872
02:05:37,380 --> 02:05:40,540
This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.

1873
02:05:40,540 --> 02:05:44,820
Save money by not buying bottled water and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.

1874
02:05:44,820 --> 02:05:47,580
ProPure is the best gravity fed filter out there.

1875
02:05:47,580 --> 02:05:49,580
It's what my family uses.

Tyranny is here.

1893
02:07:08,340 --> 02:07:11,980
The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.

1894
02:07:11,980 --> 02:07:14,660
It really says that the state is God.

1895
02:07:14,660 --> 02:07:19,220
The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states

1896
02:07:19,220 --> 02:07:20,440
on earth.

1897
02:07:20,440 --> 02:07:25,260
This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being

1898
02:07:25,260 --> 02:07:27,100
expanded nationwide.

1899
02:07:27,100 --> 02:07:31,260
This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all

1900
02:07:31,260 --> 02:07:33,200
powerful shadow state.

1901
02:07:33,200 --> 02:07:37,220
Police state four chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.

1902

citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.

1904
02:07:47,460 --> 02:07:50,980
It's only the beginning of the new world order's hellish plan.

1905
02:07:50,980 --> 02:07:53,020
The police state isn't coming.

1906
02:07:53,020 --> 02:07:54,020

1909
02:08:09,700 --> 02:08:18,460
That's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.

1910
02:08:18,460 --> 02:08:29,700
Yes, everybody in Cleveland, low minority got Obama phoned, keep Obama in president,

1911
02:08:29,700 --> 02:08:30,700
you know?

1912
02:08:30,700 --> 02:08:31,700
He gave us a phone.

1913
02:08:31,700 --> 02:08:32,700
He gave you a phone.

1914
02:08:32,700 --> 02:08:33,700
He's going to do more.

1915
02:08:33,700 --> 02:08:34,700
How did he give you a phone?

1916
02:08:34,700 --> 02:08:39,620
You sign up and you're on full stamps, you're on social security, you got low income, you

1917
02:08:39,620 --> 02:08:40,620
got disability.

1918
02:08:40,620 --> 02:08:43,180
Okay, what's wrong with Romney again?

1919
02:08:43,180 --> 02:08:44,180
Let's talk about it.

1920
02:08:44,180 --> 02:08:49,500
Okay, we're here with the real live Obama phone lady and now her name is revealed.

1921
02:08:49,500 --> 02:08:50,500
She's that mystery person.

1922
02:08:50,500 --> 02:08:52,460
I'm like, I want that lady on.

1923
02:08:52,460 --> 02:08:53,460
What's her name?

1924
02:08:53,460 --> 02:08:55,740
Let's find her and our listeners found her.

1925
02:08:55,740 --> 02:08:57,660
Now she's since been called by The View.

1926
02:08:57,660 --> 02:09:01,700
She's reportedly going to go on that soon and a bunch of other stations, but she's here

1927
02:09:01,700 --> 02:09:06,300
first with us and she's a little subdued today.

1928
02:09:06,300 --> 02:09:09,700
I think we had a few too many beers last night, I'm joking.

1929
02:09:09,700 --> 02:09:10,700
I'm joking.

1930
02:09:10,700 --> 02:09:11,700
We didn't know actually we did.

1931
02:09:11,700 --> 02:09:15,500
Anyways, but she's going to be on the nightly news with us tonight as well.

1932
02:09:15,500 --> 02:09:17,140
And I want to go back to your calls.

1933
02:09:17,140 --> 02:09:18,780
I want to go over a whole bunch of issues.

1934
02:09:18,780 --> 02:09:22,580
I want to take your Twitter questions here today.

1935
02:09:22,580 --> 02:09:25,940
But you heard the last caller, but we were going to break.

1936
02:09:25,940 --> 02:09:32,680
Where do you stand on the right to keep and bear arms?

1937
02:09:32,680 --> 02:09:36,160
You're not on a Perry Mason up on the courtroom.

1938
02:09:36,160 --> 02:09:39,260
We just want to know where you come from.

1939
02:09:39,260 --> 02:09:40,260
Where do you stand on the Second Amendment?

1940
02:09:40,260 --> 02:09:43,260
Where do you stand on the right to own guns?

1941
02:09:43,260 --> 02:09:45,300
I'm against that.

1942
02:09:45,300 --> 02:09:46,480
There you go.

1943
02:09:46,480 --> 02:09:51,680
So you want the government to have guns, but not the people?

1944
02:09:51,680 --> 02:09:53,400
No guns at all.

1945
02:09:53,400 --> 02:09:55,300
Have faith in God.

1946
02:09:55,300 --> 02:09:58,420
Well, God has faith in those that have faith in themselves.

1947
02:09:58,420 --> 02:10:05,860
See, I mean- I'm not into the guns, you know, and to me it's a lot of nonsense with that.

1948
02:10:05,860 --> 02:10:08,300
I'm not into guns with the government having them.

1949
02:10:08,300 --> 02:10:09,300
No.

1950
02:10:09,300 --> 02:10:14,460
I mean, the government has bought 1.6 billion bullets, armored vehicles, helicopters, SWAT

1951
02:10:14,460 --> 02:10:15,460
teams.

1952
02:10:15,460 --> 02:10:19,980
A SWAT team busted in and shot an innocent guy 16 times.

1953
02:10:19,980 --> 02:10:24,620
And they said it was justified because he was reaching to turn the light on.

1954
02:10:24,620 --> 02:10:26,780
And they lied and said he had four guns, which he didn't.

1955
02:10:26,780 --> 02:10:30,740
Even though they got caught lying, because it's about officer safety.

1956
02:10:30,740 --> 02:10:31,740
So I got an idea.

1957
02:10:31,740 --> 02:10:35,460
How about everyone on Earth but police commits suicide?

1958
02:10:35,460 --> 02:10:40,820
Six billion, 300 million people commit suicide, but the 15 million police are so worldwide

1959
02:10:40,820 --> 02:10:42,440
for their safety.

1960
02:10:42,440 --> 02:10:45,540
Because if they say, if they think it's their safety, they kill you?

1961
02:10:45,540 --> 02:10:48,460
How about everyone on Earth commits suicide so they're safe?

1962
02:10:48,460 --> 02:10:51,060
That's what the New World Order wants.

1963
02:10:51,060 --> 02:10:55,620
They want to have world government to set up a medical tyranny to force cancer virus

1964
02:10:55,620 --> 02:10:59,540
injections into us via vaccines, and GMO they force fetus.

1965
02:10:59,540 --> 02:11:02,640
And these globalists think we're so dumb, Michelle, they've written books how they're

1966
02:11:02,640 --> 02:11:05,380
doing it to us.

1967
02:11:05,380 --> 02:11:07,700
Do you know about, I mean, you know about Tuskegee?

1968
02:11:07,700 --> 02:11:12,620
Why do you trust a government that you know nerve gas for our own troops, that you know?

1969
02:11:12,620 --> 02:11:17,900
Did you hear about in New York City, how they were giving little kids, mainly black kids?

1970
02:11:17,900 --> 02:11:21,020
Cuz the government loves black kids so much, wants to give you free stuff.

1971
02:11:21,020 --> 02:11:22,100
No, they're not your friends.

1972
02:11:22,100 --> 02:11:25,220
I'm trying to really reach out to you here, and I understand they've shut the economy

1973
02:11:25,220 --> 02:11:26,220
down.

1974
02:11:26,220 --> 02:11:28,860
I understand things are desperate, I get all that.

1975
02:11:28,860 --> 02:11:30,620
I understand that.

1976
02:11:30,620 --> 02:11:35,060
And what I'm saying is, the New York Daily News six years ago reported they were testing

1977
02:11:35,060 --> 02:11:38,340
pesticides on little kids till they killed them.

1978
02:11:38,340 --> 02:11:42,740
Now, see, I happen to care about those kids no matter what color they are.

1979
02:11:42,740 --> 02:11:46,900
They happen to be mainly black, because for some reason in the liberal intelligentsia

1980
02:11:46,900 --> 02:11:47,900
it's okay.

1981
02:11:47,900 --> 02:11:52,780
But some of the CPS workers blew the whistle and said, you know, these kids are dying.

1982
02:11:52,780 --> 02:11:54,280
Is this okay?

1983
02:11:54,280 --> 02:11:55,280
Should we be killing them?

1984
02:11:55,280 --> 02:11:56,280
Cuz we're the government.

1985
02:11:56,280 --> 02:12:00,140
I mean, is it okay for the government to chain little black kids down and feed pesticides

1986
02:12:00,140 --> 02:12:02,140
to them?

1987
02:12:02,140 --> 02:12:03,140
Bug poison.

1988
02:12:03,140 --> 02:12:06,820
Now, I mean, I can show you all these articles.

1989
02:12:06,820 --> 02:12:10,020
Now, does that sound like a nice group of people there?

1990
02:12:10,020 --> 02:12:11,020
No.

1991
02:12:11,020 --> 02:12:17,420
Okay, you told me, you and Harvey told me why you want the guns taken last night, and

1992
02:12:17,420 --> 02:12:18,420
I understand it.

1993
02:12:18,420 --> 02:12:21,820
Why don't you repeat what you said?

1994
02:12:21,820 --> 02:12:28,960
Well, I don't want the guns for the president to get them.

1995
02:12:28,960 --> 02:12:33,820
The people out here, you could buy guns on the street, you could buy them from police

1996
02:12:33,820 --> 02:12:34,820
officers.

1997
02:12:34,820 --> 02:12:39,180
Yeah, I know, that's where you got to get drugs and everything, the police, yeah.

1998
02:12:39,180 --> 02:12:40,660
Right, right, right.

1999
02:12:40,660 --> 02:12:45,180
And just by me being on your talk show and thinking about it, them are the biggest cruel

2000
02:12:45,180 --> 02:12:48,100
people there is, you know?

2001
02:12:48,100 --> 02:12:54,240
Just by you saying about the guns, the president got all these guns and protected, but what

2002
02:12:54,240 --> 02:12:56,380
about the people that help you protect us?

2003
02:12:56,380 --> 02:12:57,900
Well, I mean, here's the deal.

2004
02:12:57,900 --> 02:13:02,620
I've talked to people at MTV, multiple people, who said in the mid 90s, they said, we're

2005
02:13:02,620 --> 02:13:06,060
gonna promote this gangster rap to take over the culture.

2006
02:13:06,060 --> 02:13:08,660
That's a time bomb, and the rappers are killing each other.

2007
02:13:08,660 --> 02:13:12,220
They'll have $50 million in the bank, but to be a man, they'll shoot somebody.

2008
02:13:12,220 --> 02:13:16,580
I get, cuz that's what Harvey, your husband, was saying, he goes, look, I've had nephews

2009
02:13:16,580 --> 02:13:17,580
killed.

2010
02:13:17,580 --> 02:13:20,080
I get that that's terrible and horrible.

2011
02:13:20,080 --> 02:13:23,500
And there's a lot of rappers like KRS1, who's one of my listeners, and others, and Professor

2012
02:13:23,500 --> 02:13:26,220
Griff, who are saying that's wrong.

2013
02:13:26,220 --> 02:13:29,440
And you know what, it is a program for blacks to kill each other.

2014
02:13:29,440 --> 02:13:35,680
So I'm against that inner city violence, believe me, but that isn't a reason for everybody

2015
02:13:35,680 --> 02:13:38,060
else to lose their guns.

2016
02:13:38,060 --> 02:13:40,500
Take Chicago, you know they have the highest crime rate in the world?

2017
02:13:40,500 --> 02:13:41,980
We're on the radio in Chicago.

2018
02:13:41,980 --> 02:13:43,920
That's not for them, you're right.

2019
02:13:43,920 --> 02:13:46,220
But they've taken the guns there.

2020
02:13:46,220 --> 02:13:49,860
Only law abiding citizens then gave their guns up.

2021
02:13:49,860 --> 02:13:53,980
So see, if I could walk through with Obama supporters, and it doesn't mean you go vote

2022
02:13:53,980 --> 02:13:54,980
for Romney.

2023
02:13:54,980 --> 02:13:56,220
They all were in so much trouble.

2024
02:13:56,220 --> 02:13:58,860
Did you know the very same interest fund, both men?

2025
02:13:58,860 --> 02:14:01,480
Yeah, I knew that.

2026
02:14:01,480 --> 02:14:05,460
But then Obama, he is charming, he's like, hey, I'm gonna take care of you.

2027
02:14:05,460 --> 02:14:08,900
You know what I'm gonna, did you see in the first campaign people going, thank you, Mr.

2028
02:14:08,900 --> 02:14:09,900
President.

2029
02:14:09,900 --> 02:14:10,900
I'm gonna get a free house.

2030
02:14:10,900 --> 02:14:11,900
I'm gonna get a free car.

2031
02:14:11,900 --> 02:14:12,900
Right.

2032
02:14:12,900 --> 02:14:13,900
Right.

2033
02:14:13,900 --> 02:14:14,900
And those people did not get free houses and free cars.

2034
02:14:14,900 --> 02:14:16,820
He didn't do nothing for Lee and Harvard.

2035
02:14:16,820 --> 02:14:21,060
He promised them people he was gonna get a big office if he win this time.

2036
02:14:21,060 --> 02:14:26,980
You heard him on the news say how he come back to Cleveland and Detroit and get us low

2037
02:14:26,980 --> 02:14:28,940
black minorities to vote.

2038
02:14:28,940 --> 02:14:34,300
But look how we living, Lee and Harvard and Cleveland, Ohio still where his office at

2039
02:14:34,300 --> 02:14:35,300
is still the same.

2040
02:14:35,300 --> 02:14:40,460
Well, I mean, and again, Obama said, I will not sign the NDAA, don't worry about beating

2041
02:14:40,460 --> 02:14:41,660
it.

2042
02:14:41,660 --> 02:14:44,700
Because there was opposition, it was gonna get beaten, but he said, but I'm gonna veto

2043
02:14:44,700 --> 02:14:45,700
it.

2044
02:14:45,700 --> 02:14:46,700
So people said, well, just let it pass.

2045
02:14:46,700 --> 02:14:47,700
Right.

2046
02:14:47,700 --> 02:14:48,700
Then he signed it.

2047
02:14:48,700 --> 02:14:49,700
Right.

2048
02:14:49,700 --> 02:14:50,700
So he went against our word and signed it anyway.

2049
02:14:50,700 --> 02:14:52,660
But the point is, it turned out he wrote it.

2050
02:14:52,660 --> 02:14:53,660
Right.

2051
02:14:53,660 --> 02:14:57,460
I mean, this guy makes, it's devilish lying.

2052
02:14:57,460 --> 02:15:00,300
Okay, and Romney's a devilish liar too.

2053
02:15:00,300 --> 02:15:04,900
The point is, is that it's how far gone we are, Michelle, is why things are getting worse

2054
02:15:04,900 --> 02:15:05,900
and worse.

2055
02:15:05,900 --> 02:15:07,340
Let me play you a clip here.

2056
02:15:07,340 --> 02:15:11,060
This is Obama saying your payroll tax, nothing's going up.

2057
02:15:11,060 --> 02:15:14,660
But you know, more than 14 taxes are going up.

2058
02:15:14,660 --> 02:15:17,380
And there's a 3.8% tax on investments.

2059
02:15:17,380 --> 02:15:19,260
There's another tax on payroll.

2060
02:15:19,260 --> 02:15:25,140
There's taxes across the board that have gone up on almost every American, every American

2061
02:15:25,140 --> 02:15:26,140
that works.

2062
02:15:26,140 --> 02:15:30,900
77% of Americans got a tax increase, you can just type that into a search engine.

2063
02:15:30,900 --> 02:15:35,740
Now when you get your next paycheck, I guess when you get back, I want you to notice in

2064
02:15:35,740 --> 02:15:38,500
there all the little things that are taken out, okay?

2065
02:15:38,500 --> 02:15:39,500
Now are you rich?

2066
02:15:39,500 --> 02:15:40,500
Heck no.

2067
02:15:40,500 --> 02:15:43,980
Did you know that Kennedy cut taxes by 50%?

2068
02:15:43,980 --> 02:15:46,780
Do you know what happened a year later?

2069
02:15:46,780 --> 02:15:48,660
Gave it back?

2070
02:15:48,660 --> 02:15:49,660
Tax receipts doubled.

2071
02:15:49,660 --> 02:15:54,300
Did you know the government knows if they cut taxes, there's a boom and that more money

2072
02:15:54,300 --> 02:15:55,940
comes in?

2073
02:15:55,940 --> 02:16:00,860
Michelle, why would they want to raise taxes?

2074
02:16:00,860 --> 02:16:06,540
Why would they want to chain kids down and dump pesticide down their throat?

2075
02:16:06,540 --> 02:16:12,060
See, did you see that news article about the top BBC presenter being a Satanist with kids?

2076
02:16:12,060 --> 02:16:14,060
Why would he want to do that to little kids?

2077
02:16:14,060 --> 02:16:16,700
He's a Satanist, that's why.

2078
02:16:16,700 --> 02:16:20,620
And see, the devil comes as an angel of light.

2079
02:16:20,620 --> 02:16:23,220
It's true, that's in the Bible.

2080
02:16:23,220 --> 02:16:26,460
And will speak scripture, okay?

2081
02:16:26,460 --> 02:16:30,420
This government is the most evil government the world's ever seen.

2082
02:16:30,420 --> 02:16:35,460
Our government funded Hitler and then destroyed him.

2083
02:16:35,460 --> 02:16:38,600
Our government created Lenin and Stalin.

2084
02:16:38,600 --> 02:16:39,600
Did you know that's declassified?

2085
02:16:39,600 --> 02:16:43,300
Do you know our government put Mao Tse Tung in?

2086
02:16:43,300 --> 02:16:44,660
Declassified.

2087
02:16:44,660 --> 02:16:49,460
Mao Tse Tung conservatively killed 66 million people.

2088
02:16:49,460 --> 02:16:51,180
The Chinese government says 80 plus million.

2089
02:16:51,180 --> 02:16:53,660
Do you know how many people that is?

2090
02:16:53,660 --> 02:16:55,900
A sports stadium is 100,000.

2091
02:16:55,900 --> 02:16:59,220
That's almost, moreover, 140, you got.

2092
02:16:59,220 --> 02:17:00,820
Yeah, 100,000 people.

2093
02:17:00,820 --> 02:17:04,220
How many sports stadiums is 80 million people?

2094
02:17:04,220 --> 02:17:06,900
Two, three.

2095
02:17:06,900 --> 02:17:08,460
Starved to death, lined up and shot.

2096
02:17:08,460 --> 02:17:14,420
Do you know our government shipped in shiploads of bullets so he could just mow them down?

2097
02:17:14,420 --> 02:17:17,420
It's not our government.

2098
02:17:17,420 --> 02:17:23,500
They're called eugenicists, eugenicists, they're scientific dictators.

2099
02:17:23,500 --> 02:17:26,700
Obama is reading off a teleprompter.

2100
02:17:26,700 --> 02:17:30,660
And we've got to realize that the entire system is evil.

2101
02:17:30,660 --> 02:17:31,900
And I don't wanna sit here and preach at you.

2102
02:17:31,900 --> 02:17:33,200
Let's play this first clip.

2103
02:17:33,200 --> 02:17:39,100
This is Obama four years ago saying, I will never raise your taxes, not $1, here it is.

2104
02:17:39,100 --> 02:17:48,740
And I can make a firm pledge under my plan, no family making less than $250,000 a year

2105
02:17:48,740 --> 02:17:55,060
will see any form of tax increase, not your income tax, not your payroll tax, not your

2106
02:17:55,060 --> 02:17:59,580
capital gains taxes, not any of your taxes.

2107
02:17:59,580 --> 02:18:00,580
That's a firm pledge.

2108
02:18:00,580 --> 02:18:04,620
Now, guys, just cuz he's here, I know I've only got two guys who are in the job, eight

2109
02:18:04,620 --> 02:18:05,620
people.

2110
02:18:05,620 --> 02:18:10,060
Five pins, 77% of Americans got payroll tax increase.

2111
02:18:10,060 --> 02:18:16,100
People making $30,000 or up, now is 30,000, 250,000?

2112
02:18:16,100 --> 02:18:17,100
Is that a lie right there?

2113
02:18:17,100 --> 02:18:18,100
That's a lie.

2114
02:18:18,100 --> 02:18:22,540
George Herbert Walker Bush got thrown out of office for reading my lips, no new taxes.

2115
02:18:22,540 --> 02:18:25,140
People tell me now, well, they just lie, it's what they do.

2116
02:18:25,140 --> 02:18:28,020
Well, I know they're liars, so I'm not gonna turn my guns in.

2117
02:18:28,020 --> 02:18:30,140
Let's go to the next clip here for you.

2118
02:18:30,140 --> 02:18:31,140
Let's play this clip.

2119
02:18:31,140 --> 02:18:34,260
This is him four years ago saying, I'm not coming after your handgun or your rifle or

2120
02:18:34,260 --> 02:18:35,540
your shotgun.

2121
02:18:35,540 --> 02:18:36,540
Here's that clip.

2122
02:18:36,540 --> 02:18:40,900
When y'all go home and you're talking to your buddies and they say, he wants to take my

2123
02:18:40,900 --> 02:18:41,900
gun away.

2124
02:18:41,900 --> 02:18:47,420
You've heard it here, I'm on television, so everybody knows it.

2125
02:18:47,420 --> 02:18:50,140
I believe in the Second Amendment.

2126
02:18:50,140 --> 02:18:54,220
I believe in people's lawful right to bear arms.

2127
02:18:54,220 --> 02:18:56,520
I will not take your shotgun away.

2128
02:18:56,520 --> 02:18:59,980
I will not take your rifle away.

2129
02:18:59,980 --> 02:19:02,860
I won't take your handgun away.

2130
02:19:02,860 --> 02:19:06,100
Now, what does the devil do?

2131
02:19:06,100 --> 02:19:07,100
What does the devil do?

2132
02:19:07,100 --> 02:19:08,100
The devil lies.

2133
02:19:08,100 --> 02:19:09,100
Lies, cheats.

2134
02:19:09,100 --> 02:19:11,300
What's the devil's number one name in the Bible?

2135
02:19:11,300 --> 02:19:12,700
The deceiver.

2136
02:19:12,700 --> 02:19:13,700
The deceiver.

2137
02:19:13,700 --> 02:19:14,700
The deceiver.

2138
02:19:14,700 --> 02:19:15,700
The deceiver.

2139
02:19:15,700 --> 02:19:16,700
The deceiver.

2140
02:19:16,700 --> 02:19:17,700
The enemy.

2141
02:19:17,700 --> 02:19:20,060
The enemy.

2142
02:19:20,060 --> 02:19:22,420
I know a deceiver and an enemy when I see one.

2143
02:19:22,420 --> 02:19:25,420
Now, if he just pledged to me, he wouldn't come after my guns.

2144
02:19:25,420 --> 02:19:31,220
Now they got bills he supports that will make me hand in all my semi-autos, my handguns.

2145
02:19:31,220 --> 02:19:34,660
Yep, he lied.

2146
02:19:34,660 --> 02:19:37,180
And here's what's even worse, Michelle.

2147
02:19:37,180 --> 02:19:40,860
They've all written papers in our public saying they want all our guns taken.

2148
02:19:40,860 --> 02:19:44,420
And then Piers Morgan sits there and says, nobody wants your guns.

2149
02:19:44,420 --> 02:19:45,420
That makes me mad.

2150
02:19:45,420 --> 02:19:46,940
He's lying to my face.

2151
02:19:46,940 --> 02:19:47,940
Right.

2152
02:19:47,940 --> 02:19:48,940
Okay.

2153
02:19:48,940 --> 02:19:53,980
Michelle, I'm going to give you some films covering eugenics and what they're really

2154
02:19:53,980 --> 02:19:55,540
doing, and then we're going to have you back on.

2155
02:19:55,540 --> 02:19:58,660
But when we come back, we're going to take more calls, get to more questions and more

2156
02:19:58,660 --> 02:19:59,660
lies.

2157
02:19:59,660 --> 02:20:01,660
For the Obama Phone Lady, I'm Alex Jones.

2158
02:20:01,660 --> 02:20:02,660
All right.

2159
02:20:02,660 --> 02:20:04,660
Hello, I'm Alex Jones.

2160
02:20:04,660 --> 02:20:11,180
Myself, my family, the Infowars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we

2161
02:20:11,180 --> 02:20:16,180
are intensifying our efforts against the globalist on every front.

2162
02:20:16,180 --> 02:20:20,100
Infowars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats.

2163
02:20:20,100 --> 02:20:22,780
But we can't do that without your help.

2164
02:20:22,780 --> 02:20:28,060
By getting the films, bumper stickers and T-shirts at Infowars.com, you will wake up

2165
02:20:28,060 --> 02:20:34,100
people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.

2166
02:20:34,100 --> 02:20:37,560
We need your help to spread the word like never before.

2167
02:20:37,560 --> 02:20:43,780
They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.

2168
02:20:43,780 --> 02:20:51,220
You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization

2169
02:20:51,220 --> 02:20:52,780
and ultimate extermination.

2170
02:20:52,780 --> 02:20:55,140
The war is here.

2171
02:20:55,140 --> 02:20:56,980
It's an info war.

2172
02:20:56,980 --> 02:21:03,700
The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.

2173
02:21:03,700 --> 02:21:04,980
Don't throw away leftovers.

2174
02:21:04,980 --> 02:21:09,540
Instead, throw all your leftovers, vegetable peels, eggshells, coffee grounds, pizza crusts

2175
02:21:09,540 --> 02:21:11,220
and more into the Bokashi.

2176
02:21:11,220 --> 02:21:14,800
If you love to garden and compost but don't like the hassle of turning a compost bin or

2177
02:21:14,800 --> 02:21:16,540
the smell, then check out the E.M.

2178
02:21:16,540 --> 02:21:19,140
Bokashi Food Waste Recycling System from Tereganics.

2179

Finally, a way to recycle all your food and plant waste safely and effectively and stop

2180
02:21:23,700 --> 02:21:25,080
using fertilizers.

2181
02:21:25,080 --> 02:21:27,500
The E.M. Bokashi Food Waste Recycling System.

2182
02:21:27,500 --> 02:21:31,820
Rather than decomposition, the Bokashi system uses fermentation to break down waste so it

2183
02:21:31,820 --> 02:21:36,300
takes less time to create nutrient-dense humus for crops or gardens with no turning and no

2184
02:21:36,300 --> 02:21:37,640
obnoxious odors.

2185

2191
02:21:59,780 --> 02:22:00,780
Tereganics.

2192
02:22:00,780 --> 02:22:02,960
Life's getting better.

2193
02:22:02,960 --> 02:22:07,140
On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth

2194
02:22:07,140 --> 02:22:09,660
to retire and live out their golden years.

2195
02:22:09,660 --> 02:22:14,700
Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing and medical, many

2196
02:22:14,700 --> 02:22:17,740
retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.

2197
02:22:17,740 --> 02:22:21,620
Is this a flaw of free enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve

2198
02:22:21,620 --> 02:22:25,980
Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?

2199
02:22:25,980 --> 02:22:29,740
These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature

2200
02:22:29,740 --> 02:22:31,260
from Jekyll Island.

2201
02:22:31,260 --> 02:22:35,140
Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank

2202
02:22:35,140 --> 02:22:40,140
power, a gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.

2203
02:22:40,140 --> 02:22:41,540
Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

2204

2206
02:22:51,100 --> 02:22:54,220

Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.

2209
02:23:00,980 --> 02:23:03,060
Hi there.

2210
02:23:03,060 --> 02:23:04,060
My name is Frank Bates.

2211
02:23:04,060 --> 02:23:08,300
What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble.

2212
02:23:08,300 --> 02:23:14,580
I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity

2213
02:23:14,580 --> 02:23:19,180
monopolies and government agencies for what they really are, incompetent, lying crooks

2214
02:23:19,180 --> 02:23:24,420
that are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high.

2215
02:23:24,420 --> 02:23:29,460
Some have called this a conspiracy, others have called it a coverup and you will be shocked

2216
02:23:29,460 --> 02:23:32,340
to find out how deep the conspiracy goes.

2217
02:23:32,340 --> 02:23:37,980
My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them

2218
02:23:37,980 --> 02:23:40,300
and how you can beat them too.

2219
02:23:40,300 --> 02:23:44,160
Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen

2220
02:23:44,160 --> 02:23:45,740
in the last three months.

2221
02:23:45,740 --> 02:23:51,260
Go to 123coverup.com and discover one weird trick to slash your power bill and protect

2222
02:23:51,260 --> 02:23:52,260
your home.

2223
02:23:52,260 --> 02:23:58,060
Go watch my video now at 123coverup.com before they force me to shut it down.

2224
02:23:58,060 --> 02:24:17,340
But again, that's 123coverup.com.

2225
02:24:17,340 --> 02:24:18,340
She's here.

2226
02:24:18,340 --> 02:24:19,340
She's the Obama lady.

2227
02:24:19,340 --> 02:24:22,580
I promise we're going to your calls here in just a moment and a bunch of your tweet questions.

2228
02:24:22,580 --> 02:24:27,180
But look, we're getting right down to the bottom of it here.

2229
02:24:27,180 --> 02:24:32,220
You know the government's corrupt and bad, and so you're like, there's all this emotion

2230
02:24:32,220 --> 02:24:33,220
about the poor kids.

2231
02:24:33,220 --> 02:24:37,540
Yeah, let's turn our guns in, but you start thinking about, hey, who's really running

2232
02:24:37,540 --> 02:24:38,540
things?

2233
02:24:38,540 --> 02:24:40,140
Is it good to have only the government with guns?

2234
02:24:40,140 --> 02:24:42,580
And then it sounds like you're starting to agree with me.

2235
02:24:42,580 --> 02:24:49,500
Well, then I learned and found out and you showed me in paperwork and on TV what he said.

2236
02:24:49,500 --> 02:24:52,060
You know, I don't put nothing past anybody.

2237
02:24:52,060 --> 02:24:58,500
I've been a mother of five kids, single mother, and they told me if I sign my name, they're

2238
02:24:58,500 --> 02:25:03,340
going to give me so much of food stamps, so much of cash.

2239
02:25:03,340 --> 02:25:06,740
But then they put me on a budget and say, this is it.

2240
02:25:06,740 --> 02:25:12,340
If the rent's 600, then you're only giving me 300, how am I going to make it with five

2241
02:25:12,340 --> 02:25:13,340
kids?

2242
02:25:13,340 --> 02:25:17,780
But see, that's the end of humanity where they break up our families and the state pays

2243
02:25:17,780 --> 02:25:19,780
for things and they control everything.

2244
02:25:19,780 --> 02:25:24,580
Well, you got a point there because I'm a living example right now.

2245
02:25:24,580 --> 02:25:25,860
When I lost that job-

2246
02:25:25,860 --> 02:25:30,460
You're a peace fellow, that's okay.

2247
02:25:30,460 --> 02:25:35,420
Hey, guys, come help her, please, cuz if she had it off, then I put it back in and I don't

2248
02:25:35,420 --> 02:25:36,420
really know how to do it.

2249
02:25:36,420 --> 02:25:40,940
Okay, well, here I go, that's- He's going to help you, go ahead.

2250
02:25:40,940 --> 02:25:41,940
It's good radio.

2251
02:25:41,940 --> 02:25:45,840
By the way, you're wound up during the breaks, just be yourself, go ahead.

2252
02:25:45,840 --> 02:25:48,380
I'm not telling you to be wound up, but you're wound up normally.

2253
02:25:48,380 --> 02:25:50,460
It's not like you're in a courtroom or something, go ahead.

2254
02:25:50,460 --> 02:25:53,420
Well, see, like I was saying, I don't hear anything.

2255
02:25:53,420 --> 02:25:55,260
That's cuz we're not taking calls right now, go ahead.

2256
02:25:55,260 --> 02:26:00,580
Well, see, like I was saying, listening to Alex Jones and he's telling me and I've seen

2257
02:26:00,580 --> 02:26:03,220
it on the news, that's true.

2258
02:26:03,220 --> 02:26:09,900
Because those people wired me up to work for $11 an hour and for a couple months, and then

2259
02:26:09,900 --> 02:26:11,100
they threw me out the door.

2260
02:26:11,100 --> 02:26:14,620
They got what they wanted from me and you're off.

2261
02:26:14,620 --> 02:26:19,140
And that's true because even when I got a paycheck, I went to the boss and I said, you

2262
02:26:19,140 --> 02:26:21,820
mean I worked and you didn't take out any taxes?

2263
02:26:21,820 --> 02:26:24,220
Now, how could you do that?

2264
02:26:24,220 --> 02:26:29,140
Cuz I'm working for Obama, he should get the same privileges I'm working for.

2265
02:26:29,140 --> 02:26:32,260
Well, you're a contractor is why it happened.

2266
02:26:32,260 --> 02:26:36,260
But I've noticed with the Obama folks, they won't even give people the tax forms cuz they're

2267
02:26:36,260 --> 02:26:37,820
above the law.

2268
02:26:37,820 --> 02:26:42,680
Well, we didn't get a tax form, they didn't take out any taxes, it didn't go, now I got

2269
02:26:42,680 --> 02:26:46,540
a job that hit right to the government with the welfare.

2270
02:26:46,540 --> 02:26:48,920
My stamps got cut, everything.

2271
02:26:48,920 --> 02:26:52,900
When I was working for Obama, I got everything off the trip.

2272
02:26:52,900 --> 02:26:55,500
That right there tell you that it's not right.

2273
02:26:55,500 --> 02:27:00,660
Well, look, all I can say is they're doing everything they can to make it not pay to

2274
02:27:00,660 --> 02:27:01,980
actually work.

2275
02:27:01,980 --> 02:27:03,860
Or if you do work, you can't live on it.

2276
02:27:03,860 --> 02:27:06,300
I can't, and that's true, sir.

2277
02:27:06,300 --> 02:27:11,460
I just got a job and I'm glad I met you, Alex Jones, I just got a job.

2278
02:27:11,460 --> 02:27:16,220
And I'm making a little bit, but it's not what I was making with Obama.

2279
02:27:16,220 --> 02:27:21,380
When I was with Obama, I was making a nice dollar to pay my rent here after November

2280
02:27:21,380 --> 02:27:23,740
was over, I'm out of a job.

2281
02:27:23,740 --> 02:27:27,060
I couldn't even apply for unemployment or any of that.

2282
02:27:27,060 --> 02:27:31,140
So like he was saying, like you say, Alex Jones, I believe that.

2283
02:27:31,140 --> 02:27:32,380
Because when I got out of work-

2284
02:27:32,380 --> 02:27:34,780
We'll fix your piece after the break, I'm sorry.

2285
02:27:34,780 --> 02:27:37,460
I'll get it plugged in properly and get you audio stuff, okay?

2286
02:27:37,460 --> 02:27:38,460
Keep talking?

2287
02:27:38,460 --> 02:27:40,980
No, it's okay, just don't worry about it, okay?

2288
02:27:40,980 --> 02:27:43,340
You just got up, got unplugged, never got plugged back in, right?

2289
02:27:43,340 --> 02:27:46,860
We're gonna get you audio during the next thing, or we can just do this whole segment

2290
02:27:46,860 --> 02:27:49,380
on it right now.

2291
02:27:49,380 --> 02:27:55,860
Again, this is a program of domination, a program of total control.

2292
02:27:55,860 --> 02:28:00,820
This is a program of domestication.

2293
02:28:00,820 --> 02:28:01,820
That's what's happening.

2294
02:28:01,820 --> 02:28:02,980
Let's jam a phone call in here.

2295
02:28:02,980 --> 02:28:05,700
Jerry in Connecticut, you're on the air, go ahead.

2296
02:28:05,700 --> 02:28:08,020
Hi there, Michelle.

2297
02:28:08,020 --> 02:28:11,780
You should check out Dick Gregory's interview with Alex Jones.

2298
02:28:11,780 --> 02:28:18,060
It'll clue you in a lot to what's really going on in the world and give you a better perspective.

2299
02:28:18,060 --> 02:28:22,580
Because you know Dick Gregory, he's been around for the civil rights movement, he's been part

2300
02:28:22,580 --> 02:28:27,780
of everything, he's seen everything, he's a man who knows the real world.

2301
02:28:27,780 --> 02:28:30,780
He knows 9-11 is an inside job.

2302
02:28:30,780 --> 02:28:36,100
He knows they killed JFK, RFK, and Martin Luther King.

2303
02:28:36,100 --> 02:28:41,660
And they're the people who want all the guns because they want to put us in the damn camps.

2304
02:28:41,660 --> 02:28:43,820
And that's the end of the story.

2305
02:28:43,820 --> 02:28:49,540
They want to make us dependent so we can't live on our own, we can't make our own money

2306
02:28:49,540 --> 02:28:50,540
and stuff like that.

2307
02:28:50,540 --> 02:28:53,340
And you got to realize, this is a sucker game.

2308
02:28:53,340 --> 02:28:54,940
And I'll give you one good example.

2309
02:28:54,940 --> 02:29:03,900
Guys who basically funded Romney and also funded Obama, Goldman Sachs, they played derivatives

2310
02:29:03,900 --> 02:29:06,860
on foods around the world.

2311
02:29:06,860 --> 02:29:10,860
And everybody's been screaming, every civil rights group, because they've been killing

2312
02:29:10,860 --> 02:29:12,420
millions of kids.

2313
02:29:12,420 --> 02:29:17,420
Because every time they push the prices of food up through their manipulation of the

2314
02:29:17,420 --> 02:29:23,900
food prices, they're killing millions of kids in Africa, in Asia, and Obama says nothing.

2315
02:29:23,900 --> 02:29:24,900
Yeah, exactly.

2316
02:29:24,900 --> 02:29:28,020
When food goes up like, this is a great call, I'm going to hold you over, sir.

2317
02:29:28,020 --> 02:29:30,260
Stay right there, I'm going to come back to you, Jerry.

2318
02:29:30,260 --> 02:29:31,260
He's exactly right.

2319
02:29:31,260 --> 02:29:36,340
The increased food price is 30, 40% here, people just might not get as much food.

2320
02:29:36,340 --> 02:29:40,660
Most people are living in a subsistence survival level, they starve to death.

2321
02:29:40,660 --> 02:29:44,820
And then the answer is, oh well, there's too many people who let them die anyways.

2322
02:29:44,820 --> 02:29:48,860
Okay, let's just say that's true, I don't agree with it.

2323
02:29:48,860 --> 02:29:51,740
The globalists see us exactly the same as well, they want us dead.

2324
02:29:51,740 --> 02:29:52,740
Stay there.

2325
02:29:52,740 --> 02:29:54,020
We're on the march.

2326
02:29:54,020 --> 02:29:56,420
The empire's on the run.

2327
02:29:56,420 --> 02:30:04,180

Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and

2336
02:30:37,420 --> 02:30:42,560
leave the silver at the surface, but rather we have formulated our silver gel using the

2337
02:30:42,560 --> 02:30:47,140
natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the

2338
02:30:47,140 --> 02:30:51,140
skin while delivering the silver more effectively.

02:32:55,980 --> 02:32:58,020
scourge that is vaccines.

2370
02:32:58,020 --> 02:33:14,100
These titles and a lot more are all available at infowarshop.com.

2371
02:33:14,100 --> 02:33:18,900
Go up to infowars.com, you can see some of the great Photoshop artwork by the Info Wars

2372
02:33:18,900 --> 02:33:20,740
graphics team.

2373
02:33:20,740 --> 02:33:26,740
It's Piers Morgan machine gunning the Bill of Rights and Constitution with an AR-15.

2374
02:33:26,740 --> 02:33:31,460
Rahm Emanuel, take American people out of Second Amendment debate.

2375
02:33:31,460 --> 02:33:35,780
And he is now announcing that they want to use executive orders.

2376
02:33:35,780 --> 02:33:38,180
Again, they're expanding that.

2377
02:33:38,180 --> 02:33:43,180
Chicago mayor limit access to guns, Chicago mayor and former Obama Chief of Staff Rahm

2378
02:33:43,180 --> 02:33:49,420
Emanuel has proposed restricting the discussion over firearms ownership in America to law

2379
02:33:49,420 --> 02:33:50,420
enforcement.

2380
02:33:50,420 --> 02:33:51,420
I mean, what a dictator.

2381
02:33:51,420 --> 02:33:53,620
Guys, will you get that audio for me?

2382
02:33:53,620 --> 02:33:56,300
It's just unbelievable.

2383
02:33:56,300 --> 02:33:57,780
It's up at infowars.com.

2384
02:33:57,780 --> 02:34:00,460
This is just off the chart.

2385
02:34:00,460 --> 02:34:03,540
And again, I covered this at the start of the show.

2386
02:34:03,540 --> 02:34:08,460
Ladies and gentlemen, they are saying they're gonna use executive orders, rule making.

2387
02:34:08,460 --> 02:34:12,540
But Schumer came out and said, we'll just order gun shops, do what we want.

2388
02:34:12,540 --> 02:34:15,340
And by the way, you're like, well, they can't do that outside law.

2389
02:34:15,340 --> 02:34:17,460
The ATF's already been doing that.

2390
02:34:17,460 --> 02:34:22,580
So Michelle, Obama phone lady, we're gonna go back to the caller, Jerry, and then hurry

2391
02:34:22,580 --> 02:34:24,260
through some others and get to some Twitter questions.

2392
02:34:24,260 --> 02:34:29,380
They're gonna be on the news with us tonight for a more lively discussion.

2393
02:34:29,380 --> 02:34:32,980
I know we're just a little more calm here except during the breaks.

2394
02:34:32,980 --> 02:34:34,620
Why are you so restrained right now?

2395
02:34:34,620 --> 02:34:35,620
Which is fine.

2396
02:34:35,620 --> 02:34:37,820
I mean, I guess we're having a serious discussion.

2397
02:34:37,820 --> 02:34:47,200
Well, I'm phenomenal about what's going on and I thank God that I came here because I

2398
02:34:47,200 --> 02:34:50,540
seen it with my own eyes.

2399
02:34:50,540 --> 02:34:56,220
I guess, I mean, you were saying you've never seen the footage of yourself except on smartphones.

2400
02:34:56,220 --> 02:34:57,940
You have a computer at home?

2401
02:34:57,940 --> 02:34:58,940
No.

2402
02:34:58,940 --> 02:35:01,380
So all you've got mainstream television.

2403
02:35:01,380 --> 02:35:04,940
Mainstream television and my Obama phone.

2404
02:35:04,940 --> 02:35:05,940
Which isn't a smartphone, right?

2405
02:35:05,940 --> 02:35:06,940
It's just a regular phone.

2406
02:35:06,940 --> 02:35:07,940
Regular phone.

2407
02:35:07,940 --> 02:35:09,220
So yeah, cuz we couldn't send you text messages.

2408
02:35:09,220 --> 02:35:10,900
So literally, what's the number?

2409
02:35:10,900 --> 02:35:14,940
I saw a number like 65 million Americans only have access to a television.

2410
02:35:14,940 --> 02:35:17,540
Oh, it's a lot of them.

2411
02:35:17,540 --> 02:35:20,780
How many people in your community did just only have a television?

2412
02:35:20,780 --> 02:35:27,060
A lot, a lot of people because- And so you didn't know he told all those lies?

2413
02:35:27,060 --> 02:35:28,060
No.

2414
02:35:28,060 --> 02:35:29,060
I've got a bunch of others.

2415
02:35:29,060 --> 02:35:34,940
But I knew that he lied because about four years ago when I worked for the Obama campaign,

2416
02:35:34,940 --> 02:35:39,600
he said he was gonna re-renovate Harvard and the Lee area.

2417
02:35:39,600 --> 02:35:42,980
And that's where he started when I started campaigning for him.

2418
02:35:42,980 --> 02:35:46,580
Here it is four years went on and now I'm at another four years.

2419
02:35:46,580 --> 02:35:48,060
And that place still looks the same.

2420
02:35:48,060 --> 02:35:51,700
Now they've only put a few hundred billion into infrastructure, which is if you are gonna

2421
02:35:51,700 --> 02:35:54,820
have government funding, that actually gets the economy going and gives people real people

2422
02:35:54,820 --> 02:35:55,820
jobs.

2423
02:35:55,820 --> 02:35:56,820
Right.

2424
02:35:56,820 --> 02:35:58,100
If it's not given to your select buddies only.

2425
02:35:58,100 --> 02:36:04,300
But they've spent, last time I saw something like 47 trillion has been, 47 trillion, you

2426
02:36:04,300 --> 02:36:12,380
have to understand the whole country's GDP is like 15, excuse me, 47 trillion.

2427
02:36:12,380 --> 02:36:15,700
I think I said billion, those numbers are so big.

2428
02:36:15,700 --> 02:36:22,260
He only spent a few hundred billion on infrastructure total in the last four years.

2429
02:36:22,260 --> 02:36:26,700
And then 47 trillion to offshore mega banks, you're like, well, where'd that money go?

2430
02:36:26,700 --> 02:36:27,700
Right.

2431
02:36:27,700 --> 02:36:28,700
It went into derivatives.

2432
02:36:28,700 --> 02:36:31,960
So it didn't even really go anywhere, it was propping up garbage.

2433
02:36:31,960 --> 02:36:34,700
And then you're like, well, okay, well, then why are they doing it?

2434
02:36:34,700 --> 02:36:37,940
Just suck real money out of the economy and get us into debt.

2435
02:36:37,940 --> 02:36:42,700
See, we've been signed on, it'd be like if I put a chain on your leg, okay, that was

2436
02:36:42,700 --> 02:36:48,860
impossible to get off, tied to, let's say a bowling ball that weighed 500 tons.

2437
02:36:48,860 --> 02:36:50,820
Are you gonna ever be able to pull out of that?

2438
02:36:50,820 --> 02:36:51,820
No.

2439
02:36:51,820 --> 02:36:54,740
Okay, what if I threw you over the edge of a dock with that on your leg?

2440
02:36:54,740 --> 02:36:55,740
No.

2441
02:36:55,740 --> 02:36:57,260
So now you're gonna be on the bottom of the lake.

2442
02:36:57,260 --> 02:36:58,260
Right, right.

2443
02:36:58,260 --> 02:37:00,900
It's impossible and it's not our debt.

2444
02:37:00,900 --> 02:37:04,600
So what I'm saying is, Michelle, they're predators, they're bad, they do everything they can to

2445
02:37:04,600 --> 02:37:10,220
bankrupt you so that you've got to go to them because they want control.

2446
02:37:10,220 --> 02:37:16,160
And that's true because, so for instance, how you say of control, I had a friend that

2447
02:37:16,160 --> 02:37:21,780
was a school teacher and when she lost her job, she went to apply for unemployment, they

2448
02:37:21,780 --> 02:37:22,780
turned her down.

2449
02:37:22,780 --> 02:37:25,780
When she went to the welfare, they gave her the money.

2450
02:37:25,780 --> 02:37:30,340
But by her not being, have you worked as a school teacher, now you're not working and

2451
02:37:30,340 --> 02:37:34,260
you're on government assistance, do you know how low that is?

2452
02:37:34,260 --> 02:37:39,100
So she dropped down that low, she started drinking beer.

2453
02:37:39,100 --> 02:37:43,980
They sell beer in the store, but she would get so drinking, I guess her mind went crazy,

2454
02:37:43,980 --> 02:37:49,220
but she would drink so much beer, then it got into what the system got in her life.

2455
02:37:49,220 --> 02:37:53,220
And I was like, well, how could they take that quick?

2456
02:37:53,220 --> 02:37:59,820
And just by her applying, losing her job, applying for the government, they contacted

2457
02:37:59,820 --> 02:38:04,540
her, took her kids, put them in foster care and all that.

2458
02:38:04,540 --> 02:38:09,380
And I'm like, here it is, a working woman, been a teacher for all these years, and it

2459
02:38:09,380 --> 02:38:12,380
wasn't enough money after she lost the job or laid off her-

2460
02:38:12,380 --> 02:38:13,380
And they took her kids.

2461
02:38:13,380 --> 02:38:19,580
And they took her kids, but if you go down the lane of how she got corrupted like that,

2462
02:38:19,580 --> 02:38:21,660
when she got corrupted, she started drinking.

2463
02:38:21,660 --> 02:38:25,100
When she got drinking, I'm like, it gotta be helped, let's see about putting her in

2464
02:38:25,100 --> 02:38:26,100
a place.

2465
02:38:26,100 --> 02:38:31,340
When we tried to put her in one of those detox place, by her being on welfare, she couldn't

2466
02:38:31,340 --> 02:38:32,340
get in.

2467
02:38:32,340 --> 02:38:37,620
Here it is, a woman need help just cuz of her welfare, she can't get in, but it really

2468
02:38:37,620 --> 02:38:40,060
hindered a friend of mine.

2469
02:38:40,060 --> 02:38:44,580
And I couldn't feel that she works 12, 13 years as a school teacher.

2470
02:38:44,580 --> 02:38:48,140
She bought the Samoogas house for these seven kids.

2471
02:38:48,140 --> 02:38:53,300
And today, right now, all seven of her kids, they went through that stage with that, but

2472
02:38:53,300 --> 02:38:55,780
they're doctors, social workers.

2473
02:38:55,780 --> 02:38:56,780
They really-

2474
02:38:56,780 --> 02:39:03,940
So the average foster child is on seven psychotropic drugs, about 67, 68%.

2475
02:39:03,940 --> 02:39:06,060
And those drugs are designed to fry their brains.

2476
02:39:06,060 --> 02:39:07,060
Right.

2477
02:39:07,060 --> 02:39:08,060
Did they put the kids on drugs?

2478
02:39:08,060 --> 02:39:09,060
They tried to get me.

2479
02:39:09,060 --> 02:39:11,940
I got a son that was tested of HHD.

2480
02:39:11,940 --> 02:39:12,940
Totally made up.

2481
02:39:12,940 --> 02:39:14,820
Totally, I got a doctor.

2482
02:39:14,820 --> 02:39:19,740
The gas get cut off by me, my family, and everybody going to Aknotaway, and I'm putting

2483
02:39:19,740 --> 02:39:20,740
her on there.

2484
02:39:20,740 --> 02:39:23,300
Aknotaway is a good doctor in Ohio.

2485
02:39:23,300 --> 02:39:28,980
She knew me, my parents, my parents' parents, it's like a generation went down.

2486
02:39:28,980 --> 02:39:29,980
And-

2487
02:39:29,980 --> 02:39:30,980
See, that's family.

2488
02:39:30,980 --> 02:39:31,980
Family is power.

2489
02:39:31,980 --> 02:39:32,980
Right.

2490
02:39:32,980 --> 02:39:33,980
The system wants to get rid of that.

2491
02:39:33,980 --> 02:39:39,900
And they want federalized healthcare so that doctor can't do what they want, the state

2492
02:39:39,900 --> 02:39:40,900
wants to be the doctor.

2493
02:39:40,900 --> 02:39:41,900
See, they're gonna take-

2494
02:39:41,900 --> 02:39:46,340
I believe that because the day right now, my doctor is getting old.

2495
02:39:46,340 --> 02:39:50,740
Her and her husband used to take care of me, now my kids go to her.

2496
02:39:50,740 --> 02:39:53,460
The husband has got a lot of arthritis going on.

2497
02:39:53,460 --> 02:39:55,420
He ain't in there no more, it's just her.

2498
02:39:55,420 --> 02:39:58,020
But people are smart, they're from China.

2499
02:39:58,020 --> 02:39:59,020
You know what they're doing?

2500
02:39:59,020 --> 02:40:02,820
They're sending a whole family to take up for what she's doing.

2501
02:40:02,820 --> 02:40:06,220
The mother, first it was the husband and wife, Aknotaway.

2502
02:40:06,220 --> 02:40:09,500
Now it's the kids, the husband and the wife being doctors.

2503
02:40:09,500 --> 02:40:13,380
Like I told you about Alex Jones show, that little kid of yours, he's gonna be the next

2504
02:40:13,380 --> 02:40:15,260
Alex Jones.

2505
02:40:15,260 --> 02:40:16,260
Believe that.

2506
02:40:16,260 --> 02:40:18,020
We get old, we can't keep going on and on.

2507
02:40:18,020 --> 02:40:19,400
That's the plan.

2508
02:40:19,400 --> 02:40:22,620
That's the plan, but I'm quite sure something happened to you.

2509
02:40:22,620 --> 02:40:25,020
This little kid gonna be here if this what he like doing.

2510
02:40:25,020 --> 02:40:26,780
That's all, you can't drag him away from it.

2511
02:40:26,780 --> 02:40:27,780
No.

2512
02:40:27,780 --> 02:40:28,780
He's a lot smarter than I am.

2513
02:40:28,780 --> 02:40:30,540
And just like they say is what we teach them.

2514
02:40:30,540 --> 02:40:33,700
I have kids now and they told me, you can't send that son.

2515
02:40:33,700 --> 02:40:40,060
I got a son that I grew up on welfare and a low black minority, single parent with five

2516
02:40:40,060 --> 02:40:41,060
kids.

2517
02:40:41,060 --> 02:40:43,100
That's, Satan the devil is a liar.

2518
02:40:43,100 --> 02:40:46,700
My son is Tyrone Mixon, he graduated from Hiram College.

2519
02:40:46,700 --> 02:40:50,820
He's a social worker, a VA social worker.

2520
02:40:50,820 --> 02:40:51,820
But-

2521
02:40:51,820 --> 02:40:54,220
But see how he survived the system, but now he works for the system.

2522
02:40:54,220 --> 02:41:00,540
Right, but only way that he got through was that for me being a low black minority with

2523
02:41:00,540 --> 02:41:05,960
my low income, cuz we couldn't use the dad income cuz he worked at Chevy Boulevard.

2524
02:41:05,960 --> 02:41:09,140
We had to use my income with my five kids.

2525
02:41:09,140 --> 02:41:14,260
I couldn't understand that, but as we kept going and he went to Hiram for four years,

2526
02:41:14,260 --> 02:41:15,260
we were eligible.

2527
02:41:15,260 --> 02:41:16,260
All right, let's go back to the calls.

2528
02:41:16,260 --> 02:41:17,260
This is amazing.

2529
02:41:17,260 --> 02:41:18,260
You're getting wound up now.

2530
02:41:18,260 --> 02:41:21,620
And we got a lot of great footage too, you're awesome.

2531
02:41:21,620 --> 02:41:25,420
Let's go ahead and again, Obama phone lady is here.

2532
02:41:25,420 --> 02:41:28,740
And some people online thought I was gonna get her here just to be mean to her.

2533
02:41:28,740 --> 02:41:34,080
Ladies and gentlemen, I don't need to be mean to people to feel powerful about myself.

2534
02:41:34,080 --> 02:41:35,080
It is upsetting.

2535
02:41:35,080 --> 02:41:39,620
You're saying I vote for Obama, I'm gonna get a free phone, he's gonna do more.

2536
02:41:39,620 --> 02:41:42,980
But there was that humanity and you knew it was funny when you were saying it.

2537
02:41:42,980 --> 02:41:47,060
And so yes, we're laughing, but we're not really laughing at you, we're laughing with

2538
02:41:47,060 --> 02:41:48,060
you.

2539
02:41:48,060 --> 02:41:50,660
What did you think I was gonna do when you got down here?

2540
02:41:50,660 --> 02:41:55,740
Well, one thing about it and two for show, can't nobody make you look funny if you don't

2541
02:41:55,740 --> 02:41:57,340
allow them to make you look funny?

2542
02:41:57,340 --> 02:42:04,120
I knew whatever thing I did on YouTube with Obama, the people were not happy.

2543
02:42:04,120 --> 02:42:07,460
And I don't know why, but I was happy.

2544
02:42:07,460 --> 02:42:12,940
Because I was out there campaigning and when it came time for that cameraman to run up

2545
02:42:12,940 --> 02:42:16,460
on me, I said, if he run up on me again, I'm talking.

2546
02:42:16,460 --> 02:42:18,220
And our bosses had already told us.

2547
02:42:18,220 --> 02:42:19,780
Hey, your bosses have told you?

2548
02:42:19,780 --> 02:42:20,780
Sorry.

2549
02:42:20,780 --> 02:42:23,380
Yeah, already told us, them cameraman's run up on you, you leave them alone.

2550
02:42:23,380 --> 02:42:29,140
I said, not me, walk two miles and the man keep brushing me with a camera, he pushed

2551
02:42:29,140 --> 02:42:30,140
me.

2552
02:42:30,140 --> 02:42:33,500
And the next time he pushed me, I got to talking, it was more than just me talking.

2553
02:42:33,500 --> 02:42:36,100
Wait a minute, that guy pushed you to get you mad.

2554
02:42:36,100 --> 02:42:39,740
He pushed me, and when he pushed me, he started talking, what are you going to do?

2555
02:42:39,740 --> 02:42:42,780
And Aranymi was just getting out of the truck.

2556
02:42:42,780 --> 02:42:44,940
Now you call him Aranymi.

2557
02:42:44,940 --> 02:42:49,060
Aranymi, Aranymo, Aranymi fool.

2558
02:42:49,060 --> 02:42:51,460
Tell us about, you saw him at Aranymi, tell the story.

2559
02:42:51,460 --> 02:42:56,940
Well, while I was campaigning, as you've seen on YouTube, we were walking in the circles.

2560
02:42:56,940 --> 02:43:02,060
But Aranymi was standing there and just got out of a truck entering the building.

2561
02:43:02,060 --> 02:43:07,940
And they told us to holler and hold our signs up and say more and more to him.

2562
02:43:07,940 --> 02:43:13,020
And if I can holler at Aranymi, what about this little man with this camera behind me?

2563
02:43:13,020 --> 02:43:17,040
So they kept on saying, don't talk, don't talk, keep it moving, keep it moving.

2564
02:43:17,040 --> 02:43:22,020
It's raining, we're walking, I done walked about two miles, and then he pushed up on

2565
02:43:22,020 --> 02:43:24,120
me again, and that's when I got to talking.

2566
02:43:24,120 --> 02:43:31,860
But when I got to the office, the next day, they was like, we need you in the office.

2567
02:43:31,860 --> 02:43:33,780
So I knew I had did something.

2568
02:43:33,780 --> 02:43:36,180
That's why they called me the Obama phone lady.

2569
02:43:36,180 --> 02:43:39,060
Uh-oh, now you're starting to wake up.

2570
02:43:39,060 --> 02:43:40,060
Look out.

2571
02:43:40,060 --> 02:43:42,740
What would you say to that camera guy if you could see him again?

2572
02:43:42,740 --> 02:43:48,180
Man, where the heck you at, and why you do me like that?

2573
02:43:48,180 --> 02:43:49,180
Cuz he ran off.

2574
02:43:49,180 --> 02:43:54,400
Now, that cameraman who got me on YouTube, he got whatever he got, he didn't give me

2575
02:43:54,400 --> 02:43:57,140
a name, number, card, anything.

2576
02:43:57,140 --> 02:43:59,820
But I thank you for getting me where you got me today.

2577
02:43:59,820 --> 02:44:03,100
In fact, when you got off the plane, you were thanking Obama.

2578
02:44:03,100 --> 02:44:05,900
I mean, I guess Obama is our great provider.

2579
02:44:05,900 --> 02:44:09,460
I don't know about all that right now.

2580
02:44:09,460 --> 02:44:10,460
Tell me about Obama.

2581
02:44:10,460 --> 02:44:11,460
You like him, don't you?

2582
02:44:11,460 --> 02:44:12,460
Well, I like Obama.

2583
02:44:12,460 --> 02:44:14,900
You think he's pretty handsome, don't you?

2584
02:44:14,900 --> 02:44:17,740
No, I think Harvey's handsome.

2585
02:44:17,740 --> 02:44:20,500
I wish Harvey, Harvey is pretty slick, actually.

2586
02:44:20,500 --> 02:44:21,500
I like him.

2587
02:44:21,500 --> 02:44:22,500
I love Harvey.

2588
02:44:22,500 --> 02:44:23,500
He looks like he could be in movies.

2589
02:44:23,500 --> 02:44:24,500
Okay.

2590
02:44:24,500 --> 02:44:25,500
Kind of a cool cat.

2591
02:44:25,500 --> 02:44:26,500
He is a cool cat.

2592
02:44:26,500 --> 02:44:27,500
I love Harvey.

2593
02:44:27,500 --> 02:44:34,220
But anyway, Obama, what I liked about Obama, and it's just for me.

2594
02:44:34,220 --> 02:44:39,700
When I campaigned this year, I was out in canvassing in the world of Cleveland, and

2595
02:44:39,700 --> 02:44:42,140
a lot of people didn't know a lot.

2596
02:44:42,140 --> 02:44:45,300
And one thing about it, I would be like, can I take your number?

2597
02:44:45,300 --> 02:44:48,220
And they'd be like, you can call me, but I can't talk back.

2598
02:44:48,220 --> 02:44:49,700
I'll call you at another phone.

2599
02:44:49,700 --> 02:44:50,980
I'm like, what?

2600
02:44:50,980 --> 02:44:51,980
This Obama phone.

2601
02:44:51,980 --> 02:44:55,980
And I was like, well, if a man gave you Obama phone, is you gonna vote for him?

2602
02:44:55,980 --> 02:44:56,980
Heck yeah.

2603
02:44:56,980 --> 02:45:00,140
I was like, plenty of people telling me, yeah, I'm gonna vote for Obama, but I don't even

2604
02:45:00,140 --> 02:45:01,140
got a state ID.

2605
02:45:01,140 --> 02:45:05,740
I had to show people how in Cleveland, you can get your birth certificate and stuff free

2606
02:45:05,740 --> 02:45:08,980
to get a state ID so you can vote for Obama.

2607
02:45:08,980 --> 02:45:10,860
Did you see any illegals vote?

2608
02:45:10,860 --> 02:45:11,860
Illegal?

2609
02:45:11,860 --> 02:45:13,660
People that aren't citizens.

2610
02:45:13,660 --> 02:45:15,860
Yeah, I even got them to vote.

2611
02:45:15,860 --> 02:45:16,860
No, hold on.

2612
02:45:16,860 --> 02:45:18,860
Seriously, I was just joking.

2613
02:45:18,860 --> 02:45:19,860
I did.

2614
02:45:19,860 --> 02:45:20,860
People that wasn't in our country.

2615
02:45:20,860 --> 02:45:21,860
No, no.

2616
02:45:21,860 --> 02:45:26,940
I had some people, foreign people, that had a paper stating that they were here.

2617
02:45:26,940 --> 02:45:31,820
They turned over from, they call them Arabs, Arabs.

2618
02:45:31,820 --> 02:45:34,460
In Cleveland, we call them Arabs.

2619
02:45:34,460 --> 02:45:38,780
And the Arabs on the store, they've been here two years or whatever, but they don't have

2620
02:45:38,780 --> 02:45:40,780
a state driver's license or a state ID.

2621
02:45:40,780 --> 02:45:44,180
You're saying in Ohio, they let people vote from other countries.

2622
02:45:44,180 --> 02:45:46,340
No, they had to get a state ID.

2623
02:45:46,340 --> 02:45:51,460
No, I understand, but getting the ID allowed them to vote.

2624
02:45:51,460 --> 02:45:52,460
Right.

2625
02:45:52,460 --> 02:45:53,460
Cuz they've been here.

2626
02:45:53,460 --> 02:45:58,500
And that dude told me he'd been here three, four years and he never voted cuz he foreign

2627
02:45:58,500 --> 02:46:00,060
or not from here.

2628
02:46:00,060 --> 02:46:01,780
And I said, how long you been here?

2629
02:46:01,780 --> 02:46:02,780
And he said two years.

2630
02:46:02,780 --> 02:46:04,780
And I said- And you're sure they weren't citizens?

2631
02:46:04,780 --> 02:46:06,680
No, they weren't citizens.

2632
02:46:06,680 --> 02:46:08,700
Not if you ain't from America.

2633
02:46:08,700 --> 02:46:14,460
They had IDs from Wyoming, W-Y-O-M-I-N-G, Wyoming or-

2634
02:46:14,460 --> 02:46:15,460
Yemen?

2635
02:46:15,460 --> 02:46:16,460
Something like that.

2636
02:46:16,460 --> 02:46:20,420
I knew they weren't cuz they talk like we talk, but they're not from here.

2637
02:46:20,420 --> 02:46:21,500
All right, Michelle, I just wanna be clear.

2638
02:46:21,500 --> 02:46:22,500
I like you.

2639
02:46:22,500 --> 02:46:24,580
I think you're a good person.

2640
02:46:24,580 --> 02:46:32,420
And I wanted to make sure earlier, just to be clear, you didn't know that people that

2641
02:46:32,420 --> 02:46:34,740
are foreigners aren't allowed to vote, right?

2642
02:46:34,740 --> 02:46:35,740
You didn't know that.

2643
02:46:35,740 --> 02:46:36,740
No.

2644
02:46:36,740 --> 02:46:41,100
But when they've been here in America so long, they could go get a state ID and vote.

2645
02:46:41,100 --> 02:46:43,940
I know, so they told you that was okay at the Democratic Party.

2646
02:46:43,940 --> 02:46:44,940
Yeah.

2647
02:46:44,940 --> 02:46:46,580
They said, go get them a driver's license.

2648
02:46:46,580 --> 02:46:50,940
They've been here for so amount of ups town cuz I had to check back with the office and

2649
02:46:50,940 --> 02:46:52,900
see how they can vote.

2650
02:46:52,900 --> 02:46:56,900
They're illegal American now, they've been here so long.

2651
02:46:56,900 --> 02:46:58,100
So they were citizens.

2652
02:46:58,100 --> 02:47:01,620
They were citizen, but they didn't know that they were citizen.

2653
02:47:01,620 --> 02:47:06,740
Well, I guess they did know because they still have foreign identification, but they've been

2654
02:47:06,740 --> 02:47:09,300
here a long time.

2655
02:47:09,300 --> 02:47:12,300
And then you would help them go get a driver's license that allowed them to vote.

2656
02:47:12,300 --> 02:47:13,300
Right.

2657
02:47:13,300 --> 02:47:14,300
State ID.

2658
02:47:14,300 --> 02:47:15,300
And they were able to vote.

2659
02:47:15,300 --> 02:47:16,300
They've been here for up some years.

2660
02:47:16,300 --> 02:47:20,100
He said he owned a store like four years, he never voted.

2661
02:47:20,100 --> 02:47:21,100
And I said, well, why?

2662
02:47:21,100 --> 02:47:23,620
He said he never even applied for a state ID.

2663
02:47:23,620 --> 02:47:26,180
Have you heard about the problem of illegal aliens voting?

2664
02:47:26,180 --> 02:47:27,180
No.

2665
02:47:27,180 --> 02:47:30,580
All right, well, let's just be clear.

2666
02:47:30,580 --> 02:47:32,460
You're not sure if they were citizens or not.

2667
02:47:32,460 --> 02:47:36,980
I believe they were citizens because I took them to get an ID and they were able to vote.

2668
02:47:36,980 --> 02:47:40,220
So they had to live here for a long time, a period of time, and just didn't know that.

2669
02:47:40,220 --> 02:47:42,220
Well, you know in California, they're giving illegals IDs.

2670
02:47:42,220 --> 02:47:43,620
I mean, they give them to them everywhere.

2671
02:47:43,620 --> 02:47:44,620
They give them to them in Texas.

2672
02:47:44,620 --> 02:47:46,340
Well, see, I didn't know that.

2673
02:47:46,340 --> 02:47:50,140
In Cleveland, I know, if you ain't got a state ID, that was my job title.

2674
02:47:50,140 --> 02:47:52,440
If you didn't have a state ID, you couldn't go vote.

2675
02:47:52,440 --> 02:47:55,620
But if I can go and get you, you can go with your birth certificate in Social Security

2676
02:47:55,620 --> 02:47:57,500
and get a state ID, you can vote.

2677
02:47:57,500 --> 02:48:00,060
So they had birth certificates and state IDs?

2678
02:48:00,060 --> 02:48:01,820
No, they didn't have state IDs.

2679
02:48:01,820 --> 02:48:04,760
They had them out of town IDs.

2680
02:48:04,760 --> 02:48:06,100
So they didn't have birth certificates?

2681
02:48:06,100 --> 02:48:08,260
They had birth certificates, but they had been here.

2682
02:48:08,260 --> 02:48:09,260
They're legal.

2683
02:48:09,260 --> 02:48:11,520
They're legal to be in Ohio.

2684
02:48:11,520 --> 02:48:13,420
But they didn't ever- They were legal immigrants.

2685
02:48:13,420 --> 02:48:14,420
Right.

2686
02:48:14,420 --> 02:48:15,420
They've been here a while.

2687
02:48:15,420 --> 02:48:16,420
They were citizens.

2688
02:48:16,420 --> 02:48:17,420
Yeah, they're citizens.

2689
02:48:17,420 --> 02:48:19,380
If they're legal, they're citizens.

2690
02:48:19,380 --> 02:48:22,180
They were citizens, but they didn't know nothing about getting a state ID.

2691
02:48:22,180 --> 02:48:23,180
All right, that makes sense.

2692
02:48:23,180 --> 02:48:24,180
Okay, they were citizens.

2693
02:48:24,180 --> 02:48:25,180
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

2694
02:48:25,180 --> 02:48:26,180
They were citizens.

2695
02:48:26,180 --> 02:48:27,180
They've been here, what, three, four years?

2696
02:48:27,180 --> 02:48:28,180
Yeah.

2697
02:48:28,180 --> 02:48:29,580
And then they didn't ever- I've had a couple of them like that.

2698
02:48:29,580 --> 02:48:31,460
I had people, girls 21.

2699
02:48:31,460 --> 02:48:33,660
I had a lot of young girls.

2700
02:48:33,660 --> 02:48:36,820
You know, they talking on Obama, living in the projects.

2701
02:48:36,820 --> 02:48:40,580
If that phone stop your minutes, what you going to do?

2702
02:48:40,580 --> 02:48:41,580
Go to a payphone.

2703
02:48:41,580 --> 02:48:44,140
She had no other choice.

2704
02:48:44,140 --> 02:48:48,940
But by him giving you that phone, this what I preached to him when I was in the field service.

2705
02:48:48,940 --> 02:48:52,460
By him giving you that phone, do you want to give him a vote?

2706
02:48:52,460 --> 02:48:56,420
She tell me, I don't know what Obama do, but you talking on his phone.

2707
02:48:56,420 --> 02:48:59,300
Open your phone and tell me what it say as soon as you open it.

2708
02:48:59,300 --> 02:49:03,460
She open and say, Obama, you know he's running for president right now?

2709
02:49:03,460 --> 02:49:04,460
That's how I got it.

2710
02:49:04,460 --> 02:49:06,780
And then you didn't even have to give me anything.

2711
02:49:06,780 --> 02:49:08,660
Do you got your state ID on you?

2712
02:49:08,660 --> 02:49:11,540
And they will say, yeah, all I need is the numbers.

2713
02:49:11,540 --> 02:49:15,900
I can take the numbers off that state ID and give her a blue form where you can mail it

2714
02:49:15,900 --> 02:49:16,900
in.

2715
02:49:16,900 --> 02:49:17,900
You don't even got to go to here.

2716
02:49:17,900 --> 02:49:18,900
I got warrants.

2717
02:49:18,900 --> 02:49:20,420
I'm not going to the Board of Elections.

2718
02:49:20,420 --> 02:49:21,420
You don't need to.

2719
02:49:21,420 --> 02:49:24,300
Let me fill this paper out and the ballot going to come to your house.

2720
02:49:24,300 --> 02:49:27,980
When the ballot come in, you fill it out and mail it right back.

2721
02:49:27,980 --> 02:49:28,980
Wow.

2722
02:49:28,980 --> 02:49:29,980
Amazing.

2723
02:49:29,980 --> 02:49:33,820
Stacks of people like that in Cleveland, you know?

2724
02:49:33,820 --> 02:49:35,140
Let's talk to Jerry.

2725
02:49:35,140 --> 02:49:37,940
This is long folks, Obama phone lady here in studio with us.

2726
02:49:37,940 --> 02:49:41,020
Jerry in Connecticut, finish up your point, my friend.

2727
02:49:41,020 --> 02:49:42,020
Yeah.

2728
02:49:42,020 --> 02:49:45,220
Michelle, you seem like you're a believing woman.

2729
02:49:45,220 --> 02:49:49,340
You realize we're in the latter days, I'm sure you do, from all the signs and things

2730
02:49:49,340 --> 02:49:50,340
like that, right?

2731
02:49:50,340 --> 02:49:51,340
Right.

2732
02:49:51,340 --> 02:49:59,380
Well, why don't you look up Obama and November 5th, Illinois State Lottery winning.

2733
02:49:59,380 --> 02:50:04,340
If God was going to give us an indication that this man is on the wrong side of this

2734
02:50:04,340 --> 02:50:10,660
battle for our souls, then look up November 5th, Illinois Lottery.

2735
02:50:10,660 --> 02:50:14,660
The number that came up for the pick three, three, and this is not a, I checked this out

2736
02:50:14,660 --> 02:50:20,060
myself on one of those, you know, check the numbers, you know, type of thing came up six,

2737
02:50:20,060 --> 02:50:21,060
six, six.

2738
02:50:21,060 --> 02:50:22,060
No, I remember.

2739
02:50:22,060 --> 02:50:24,900
And then some others came up six, six, six.

2740
02:50:24,900 --> 02:50:25,900
Right.

2741
02:50:25,900 --> 02:50:26,900
I remember that too.

2742
02:50:26,900 --> 02:50:27,900
Yeah.

2743
02:50:27,900 --> 02:50:33,380
Anyway, the other thing I wanted to mention is the Tuskegee situation kept talking about

2744
02:50:33,380 --> 02:50:38,340
now that guy that did that experiment and the Tuskegee, he's an equal opportunity guy.

2745
02:50:38,340 --> 02:50:39,620
They didn't put him in jail.

2746
02:50:39,620 --> 02:50:40,620
You know what they did?

2747
02:50:40,620 --> 02:50:45,700
They took him off to one of the nuclear plants out in, I think it was in Ohio.

2748
02:50:45,700 --> 02:50:52,460
And then he decided to do an experiment by releasing all those nice nuclear particles

2749
02:50:52,460 --> 02:50:55,580
in the air to see how they would affect other people in the entire region.

2750
02:50:55,580 --> 02:50:56,580
Isn't that nice?

2751
02:50:56,580 --> 02:50:58,180
Our government is really working for us.

2752
02:50:58,180 --> 02:50:59,180
Yeah, they're really good people.

2753
02:50:59,180 --> 02:51:01,980
I think we should turn our guns into more calls coming up.

2754
02:51:01,980 --> 02:51:10,020
Hello, I'm Alex Jones, myself, my family, the Infowars.com team want to relay to you

2755
02:51:10,020 --> 02:51:15,300
and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalist on every

2756
02:51:15,300 --> 02:51:16,300
front.

2757
02:51:16,300 --> 02:51:22,060
Infowars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats, but we can't do that without

2758
02:51:22,060 --> 02:51:23,060
your help.

2759
02:51:23,060 --> 02:51:28,300
By getting the films, bumper stickers and T-shirts at Infowars.com, you will wake up

2760
02:51:28,300 --> 02:51:34,320
people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.

2761
02:51:34,320 --> 02:51:37,780
We need your help to spread the word like never before.

2762
02:51:37,780 --> 02:51:43,980
They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.

2763
02:51:43,980 --> 02:51:51,420
You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization

2764
02:51:51,420 --> 02:51:52,980
and ultimate extermination.

2765
02:51:52,980 --> 02:51:55,340
The war is here.

2766
02:51:55,340 --> 02:52:02,660
It's an Infowar, the spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.

2767
02:52:02,660 --> 02:52:07,220
Hey there, Frank Bates here.

2768
02:52:07,220 --> 02:52:12,300
Have you heard about the weird device that could wipe out 280 million Americans?

2769
02:52:12,300 --> 02:52:14,060
This is really scary stuff.

2770
02:52:14,060 --> 02:52:19,300
Defense experts warn that this odd device poses the greatest threat we've ever known.

2771
02:52:19,300 --> 02:52:23,600
In fact, just a few weeks ago, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich wrote an op-ed

2772
02:52:23,600 --> 02:52:27,260
piece for the Washington Post warning about this deadly threat.

2773
02:52:27,260 --> 02:52:30,140
I can't believe that more people aren't talking about this.

2774
02:52:30,140 --> 02:52:34,020
It may be because the liberals and the government are trying to cover it up.

2775
02:52:34,020 --> 02:52:39,700
That's why my friend just created a free video at weirddevice.com that exposes this threat

2776
02:52:39,700 --> 02:52:42,500
and blows the doors off a conspiracy.

2777
02:52:42,500 --> 02:52:48,360
Go watch the shocking video at weirddevice.com right now to discover exactly what it is plus

2778
02:52:48,360 --> 02:52:53,260
discover the number one way you and your family can survive this deadly attack.

2779
02:52:53,260 --> 02:52:57,860
I'm not sure how long this video will be online, so go to weirddevice.com before it's gone

2780
02:52:57,860 --> 02:52:58,860
forever.

2781
02:52:58,860 --> 02:52:59,860
Again, that's weirddevice.com.

2782
02:52:59,860 --> 02:53:06,340
Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the

2783
02:53:06,340 --> 02:53:07,340
Box.

2784
02:53:07,340 --> 02:53:10,300
I want you to know some very important information.

2785
02:53:10,300 --> 02:53:15,100
In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the White

2786
02:53:15,100 --> 02:53:19,420
House at a time when only the president could obtain its world-class healer.

2787
02:53:19,420 --> 02:53:24,980
Now, 27 years later, carnivore capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.

2788
02:53:24,980 --> 02:53:30,040
Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally

2789
02:53:30,040 --> 02:53:35,180
occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single

2790
02:53:35,180 --> 02:53:36,320
normal cell.

2791
02:53:36,320 --> 02:53:40,080
If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune

2792
02:53:40,080 --> 02:53:44,060
cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.

2793
02:53:44,060 --> 02:53:48,420
Call 1-866-VenusFly or order from carnivora.com.

2794
02:53:48,420 --> 02:53:51,980
That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A dot com.

2795
02:53:51,980 --> 02:53:59,380
That's 1-866-836-8735, 1-866-VenusFly or visit carnivora.com.

2796
02:53:59,380 --> 02:54:00,380
Protect your immune system.

2797
02:54:00,380 --> 02:54:09,020
It's the only one you've got.

2798
02:54:09,020 --> 02:54:12,100
Obviously we're going to have to go into 20 minutes, 30 minutes of overdrive to get to

2799
02:54:12,100 --> 02:54:16,300
all your phone calls and get to all these Twitter questions.

2800
02:54:16,300 --> 02:54:17,300
There are so many.

2801
02:54:17,300 --> 02:54:18,940
I mean, I've got hundreds here and they're all so good.

2802
02:54:18,940 --> 02:54:23,940
I'm going to try to go through a bunch of quick questions for you and not dominate.

2803
02:54:23,940 --> 02:54:29,020
Obviously on the nightly news tonight, I think David Ortiz is doing the first part, but I'm

2804
02:54:29,020 --> 02:54:30,820
going to do the interview part.

2805
02:54:30,820 --> 02:54:33,260
She's warmed up now, folks.

2806
02:54:33,260 --> 02:54:36,300
We're going to air some excerpts to it when she got here yesterday on the nightly news,

2807
02:54:36,300 --> 02:54:38,020
seven o'clock central.

2808
02:54:38,020 --> 02:54:41,300
But I'm also going to cover, man, this is bad.

2809
02:54:41,300 --> 02:54:44,700
I covered some of it today, but I didn't get into all of it.

2810
02:54:44,700 --> 02:54:47,940
The announcement is they're just going to go with executive authority.

2811
02:54:47,940 --> 02:54:52,700
Executive orders, ordering gun shops to shut down, not to sell semi-autos.

2812
02:54:52,700 --> 02:54:57,580
And now Rahm Emanuel has said, citizens aren't even in the discussion about guns, the police

2813
02:54:57,580 --> 02:54:58,580
are.

2814
02:54:58,580 --> 02:54:59,580
Well, that's judge dread.

2815
02:54:59,580 --> 02:55:02,420
I mean, it might as well just become the Soviet Union.

2816
02:55:02,420 --> 02:55:06,300
And this is where big governments and big police forces always go, while we obsess over

2817
02:55:06,300 --> 02:55:07,300
the police.

2818
02:55:07,300 --> 02:55:11,180
There are a lot of good police and either a department's good or it's bad.

2819
02:55:11,180 --> 02:55:16,080
There's hardly ever an in between, but the feds want bad departments like the Chicago

2820
02:55:16,080 --> 02:55:23,180
mob run Rahm Emanuel system and Rahm Emanuel is a despicable person.

2821
02:55:23,180 --> 02:55:28,260
Here is the mayor of Chicago, very dangerous person, saying that he wants the American

2822
02:55:28,260 --> 02:55:31,540
people to not be able to have any input on their guns.

2823
02:55:31,540 --> 02:55:34,060
Hey, punk, it's called the Second Amendment, here it is.

2824
02:55:34,060 --> 02:55:39,140
One, it's all about criminal access, it's not about gun control, it's about criminal

2825
02:55:39,140 --> 02:55:40,860
access to guns.

2826
02:55:40,860 --> 02:55:42,740
That changes the debate.

2827
02:55:42,740 --> 02:55:48,900
Two, put the police chief in the law enforcement community front and center, everybody else

2828
02:55:48,900 --> 02:55:53,540
from politician to whatever, take a back seat, because the police chiefs have a credibility

2829
02:55:53,540 --> 02:55:57,420
and authority and a voice on this, which is why they're all there.

2830
02:55:57,420 --> 02:56:01,380
I do believe as it relates to both the type of weapon being an assault weapon in this

2831
02:56:01,380 --> 02:56:07,300
case or the assault magazine, as Mike has, I think, strenuously focused us on message

2832
02:56:07,300 --> 02:56:13,580
on that, because the difference between a magazine that holds 10 and a magazine that

2833
02:56:13,580 --> 02:56:17,980
holds 20 or 30 is a lot of different type of damage that's done.

2834
02:56:17,980 --> 02:56:23,820
And those are the three things I do think you can change this debate.

2835
02:56:23,820 --> 02:56:27,660
I also think the country's in a different place like it was when we did Brady.

2836
02:56:27,660 --> 02:56:33,940
Man, the older he gets, he looks like a twin brother of Bloomberg.

2837
02:56:33,940 --> 02:56:36,180
I was just sitting there looking at him.

2838
02:56:36,180 --> 02:56:40,460
Ladies and gentlemen, you just heard him say, now by the way, in major polls, 98% you can

2839
02:56:40,460 --> 02:56:43,100
pull this up of police are pro-Second Amendment.

2840
02:56:43,100 --> 02:56:45,980
Most of the police chiefs are anti-Second Amendment because they're getting federal

2841
02:56:45,980 --> 02:56:46,980
money.

2842
02:56:46,980 --> 02:56:52,700
And there is a guy up there who's an Israeli officer, by the way, it's just unbelievable,

2843
02:56:52,700 --> 02:56:57,540
saying, by the way, our tax money pays to get Israel guns, which I'm all for citizens

2844
02:56:57,540 --> 02:57:00,620
having guns wherever, Switzerland, Israel, wherever.

2845
02:57:00,620 --> 02:57:04,220
And then he doesn't want us to have guns, he wants us to be like Chicago where the citizens

2846
02:57:04,220 --> 02:57:05,340
don't have guns.

2847
02:57:05,340 --> 02:57:07,100
What do you think of that?

2848
02:57:07,100 --> 02:57:08,820
I think that sucks.

2849
02:57:08,820 --> 02:57:12,160
Well, there you go, you're becoming an info warrior.

2850
02:57:12,160 --> 02:57:14,920
He gets to have guns and bodyguards, but we don't?

2851
02:57:14,920 --> 02:57:15,920
We need the same thing.

2852
02:57:15,920 --> 02:57:18,420
And you say we need a Second Amendment bad.

2853
02:57:18,420 --> 02:57:21,300
We need a Second Amendment bad.

2854
02:57:21,300 --> 02:57:22,300
That's true.

2855
02:57:22,300 --> 02:57:23,300
How about an Obama gun?

2856
02:57:23,300 --> 02:57:26,540
He gave me an M4, he gonna do more.

2857
02:57:26,540 --> 02:57:30,980
That would be constitutional if the government issued us all weapons.

2858
02:57:30,980 --> 02:57:34,300
I'm serious, that's what taxes are for.

2859
02:57:34,300 --> 02:57:39,860
The state should be taking taxes out to issue everybody that wants to be in the state militia,

2860
02:57:39,860 --> 02:57:42,780
we should have grenade launchers, everything.

2861
02:57:42,780 --> 02:57:46,420
You know Switzerland has that, they don't have any crime, almost none.

2862
02:57:46,420 --> 02:57:48,660
That makes sense though.

2863
02:57:48,660 --> 02:57:51,060
Absolutely, we're the people, we're the government.

2864
02:57:51,060 --> 02:57:56,820
That's right, we got you in there, right, give us some, keep us safe, you feel me?

2865
02:57:56,820 --> 02:57:59,260
You think anybody's gonna be messing around, everybody's armed?

2866
02:57:59,260 --> 02:58:00,260
No.

2867
02:58:00,260 --> 02:58:02,860
No, they're not.

2868
02:58:02,860 --> 02:58:06,780
And of course, then all the tough guys will leave their guns at home, Bill, don't take

2869
02:58:06,780 --> 02:58:08,140
your guns to town.

2870
02:58:08,140 --> 02:58:09,140
Right.

2871
02:58:09,140 --> 02:58:11,940
You know that song Johnny Cash?

2872
02:58:11,940 --> 02:58:18,800
Don't take your guns to town, Bill, leave your guns at home, son.

2873
02:58:18,800 --> 02:58:19,800
It's Obama lady.

2874
02:58:19,800 --> 02:58:23,620
The Obama lady in town, Austin, Texas right here.

2875
02:58:23,620 --> 02:58:25,820
Can you say I got me an Obama M4?

2876
02:58:25,820 --> 02:58:28,020
What's that?

2877
02:58:28,020 --> 02:58:29,700
That's an M16.

2878
02:58:29,700 --> 02:58:33,820
I got me an Obama M4, and he's gonna do more, he's gonna get me a grenade launcher under

2879
02:58:33,820 --> 02:58:36,740
it.

2880
02:58:36,740 --> 02:58:41,140
Say hello to my little friend, Overdrive, your calls, tweet questions and more, stay

2881
02:58:41,140 --> 02:58:42,140
with us.

2882
02:58:42,140 --> 02:58:53,580
Thank you for listening to GCN, visit GCNlive.com today.

2883
02:58:53,580 --> 02:58:58,580
Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive from natural disasters

2884
02:58:58,580 --> 02:59:03,160
like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on

2885
02:59:03,160 --> 02:59:05,020
by a disastrous economy?

2886
02:59:05,020 --> 02:59:07,740
Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything.

2887
02:59:07,740 --> 02:59:11,540
At e Foods Direct, we hear from customers every day that are fortunate enough to weather

2888
02:59:11,540 --> 02:59:14,460
life's storm by having a supply of food on hand.

2889
02:59:14,460 --> 02:59:19,000
After Hurricane Sandy, Danny from New York City wrote, almost all the grocery stores

2890
02:59:19,000 --> 02:59:23,820
are closed, but I managed to get my e Foods just in time to be able to help my sister

2891
02:59:23,820 --> 02:59:24,820
and niece.

2892
02:59:24,820 --> 02:59:28,620
It is better to be prepared 10 years too early than one day too late.

2893
02:59:28,620 --> 02:59:30,860
I can warn you, but I can't feed you.

Coast to coast, direct from Austin, you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.

2900
03:00:25,460 --> 03:00:26,460
All right, Michelle, you're getting wound up.

2901
03:00:26,460 --> 03:00:27,460
There's callers want to talk to you.

2902
03:00:27,460 --> 03:00:30,140
We're going to them right now.

2903
03:00:30,140 --> 03:00:35,100
And who is that first caller?

2904
03:00:35,100 --> 03:00:38,060
Abdel in Arizona, you're on the air.

2905
03:00:38,060 --> 03:00:39,060
Welcome.

2906
03:00:39,060 --> 03:00:40,940
You're on the phone with Obama lady.

2907
03:00:40,940 --> 03:00:43,180
How are you doing, Alex?

2908
03:00:43,180 --> 03:00:44,180
Good, man.

2909
03:00:44,180 --> 03:00:45,180
What's on your mind?

2910
03:00:45,180 --> 03:00:46,180
Nothing much.

2911
03:00:46,180 --> 03:00:48,700
I just wanted to say hello to you and to Obama lady.

2912
03:00:48,700 --> 03:00:53,740
Here in Tucson, everybody calls it the same thing like we've been calling it since they

2913
03:00:53,740 --> 03:00:54,740
came out.

2914
03:00:54,740 --> 03:01:00,540
So it's kind of a spontaneous thing, I would believe to call the phone from the phone.

2915
03:01:00,540 --> 03:01:01,540
Yeah.

2916
03:01:01,540 --> 03:01:03,980
So yeah, I'm now everybody I know is calling their phone, the Obama phone.

2917
03:01:03,980 --> 03:01:04,980
Yeah.

2918
03:01:04,980 --> 03:01:09,860
It seems like anything that comes, socialist will go ahead and call it the Obama and whatever

2919
03:01:09,860 --> 03:01:10,860
it is.

2920
03:01:10,860 --> 03:01:14,060
And on that note, you know, I'm a long time listener.

2921
03:01:14,060 --> 03:01:16,300
I've been following you for about nine, 10 years.

2922
03:01:16,300 --> 03:01:21,140
I've had my own MK ultra experience here in Tucson that, you know, I would be for a different

2923
03:01:21,140 --> 03:01:26,740
call or whatnot, but yeah, you know, that's the thing is that even with me knowing the

2924
03:01:26,740 --> 03:01:30,940
whole situation with the new world order and everything, I still voted for him twice.

2925
03:01:30,940 --> 03:01:32,820
And I consider myself a libertarian.

2926
03:01:32,820 --> 03:01:33,820
I follow Ron Paul.

2927
03:01:33,820 --> 03:01:37,020
So that's how powerful and how dangerous he is.

2928
03:01:37,020 --> 03:01:38,020
Even me knowing better.

2929
03:01:38,020 --> 03:01:40,420
I still go ahead and vote for him.

2930
03:01:40,420 --> 03:01:42,140
That does sound like mind control.

2931
03:01:42,140 --> 03:01:44,500
My thing is you've got to call the whole thing as a fraud.

2932
03:01:44,500 --> 03:01:48,020
It's like when I got in, here's Morgan's face and said, look, the scams over, man, you want

2933
03:01:48,020 --> 03:01:49,020
my guns.

2934
03:01:49,020 --> 03:01:51,020
Shut up and stop saying, you know, they're like, well, you just want your guns.

2935
03:01:51,020 --> 03:01:52,020
We want something reasonable.

2936
03:01:52,020 --> 03:01:53,020
We just want some reasonable.

2937
03:01:53,020 --> 03:01:54,020
Here's the bill.

2938
03:01:54,020 --> 03:01:55,020
Gonna turn your guns in.

2939
03:01:55,020 --> 03:01:56,020
I'm like, shut up.

2940
03:01:56,020 --> 03:01:57,020
Stop lying to my face.

2941
03:01:57,020 --> 03:01:58,020
You punk.

2942
03:01:58,020 --> 03:01:59,020
Good job on that.

2943
03:01:59,020 --> 03:02:00,020
So that was awesome.

2944
03:02:00,020 --> 03:02:01,020
I got really excited.

2945
03:02:01,020 --> 03:02:02,020
I got it.

2946
03:02:02,020 --> 03:02:03,020
You know, the electric Liberty, you like to say kind of, you know, transcends through

2947
03:02:03,020 --> 03:02:04,020
the television.

2948
03:02:04,020 --> 03:02:05,020
And a lot of people saw that.

2949
03:02:05,020 --> 03:02:06,020
God bless you.

2950
03:02:06,020 --> 03:02:07,020
I appreciate you holding to say that.

2951
03:02:07,020 --> 03:02:08,020
What would you say to Piers Morgan?

2952
03:02:08,020 --> 03:02:09,020
Red coat.

2953
03:02:09,020 --> 03:02:10,020
What would you say to him coming over our country and saying, turn your guns in?

2954
03:02:10,020 --> 03:02:11,020
I'm like, shut up.

2955
03:02:11,020 --> 03:02:12,020
Shut up.

2956
03:02:12,020 --> 03:02:13,020
Shut up.

2957
03:02:13,020 --> 03:02:14,020
Shut up.

2958
03:02:14,020 --> 03:02:15,020
Shut up.

2959
03:02:15,020 --> 03:02:16,020
Shut up.

2960
03:02:16,020 --> 03:02:17,020
Shut up.

2961
03:02:17,020 --> 03:02:18,020
Shut up.

2962
03:02:18,020 --> 03:02:19,020
Shut up.

2963
03:02:19,020 --> 03:02:20,020
Shut up.

2964
03:02:20,020 --> 03:02:21,020
Shut up.

2965
03:02:21,020 --> 03:02:22,020
Shut up.

2966
03:02:22,020 --> 03:02:23,020
We got to keep it simple.

2967
03:02:23,020 --> 03:02:24,020
All of us are still in the country and say.

2968
03:02:24,020 --> 03:02:25,020
And turn your guns in.

2969
03:02:25,020 --> 03:02:26,020
Stop lying.

2970
03:02:26,020 --> 03:02:27,020
Take that stuff back to where you come from.

2971
03:02:27,020 --> 03:02:29,340
If you could be saved with a gun, we need to be saved with ours.

2972
03:02:29,340 --> 03:02:30,340
That's right.

2973
03:02:30,340 --> 03:02:32,780
So now you're being converted.

2974
03:02:32,780 --> 03:02:38,840
The Obama phone lady is now Obama M4 lady.

2975
03:02:38,840 --> 03:02:42,240
Protect me with Obama gun, Obama grenade.

2976
03:02:42,240 --> 03:02:45,740
Protection just like him.

2977
03:02:45,740 --> 03:02:46,780
There you go.

2978
03:02:46,780 --> 03:02:47,780
Common Sense.

2979
03:02:47,780 --> 03:02:48,780
That's right.

2980
03:02:48,780 --> 03:02:54,340
What do you think of Rahm Emanuel saying, let's take the gun laws out of the hands of

2981
03:02:54,340 --> 03:02:57,640
the people and just let the paramilitary take our guns?

2982
03:02:57,640 --> 03:02:58,640
No.

2983
03:02:58,640 --> 03:03:03,660
Doesn't Rahm Emanuel look like a bad guy out of a cartoon, like out of a-

2984
03:03:03,660 --> 03:03:04,660
He look like he drunk.

2985
03:03:04,660 --> 03:03:08,180
He look like he drinks, he's a little buzzin'.

2986
03:03:08,180 --> 03:03:09,180
Well he is a crazed maniac.

2987
03:03:09,180 --> 03:03:10,740
You know, he's a ballet dancer.

2988
03:03:10,740 --> 03:03:11,740
Is he?

2989
03:03:11,740 --> 03:03:18,180
Well, I wouldn't listen to nothing he say, any man step on they tiptoes a fool and don't

2990
03:03:18,180 --> 03:03:25,100
walk on tiptoes and get sewer and plumbing.

2991
03:03:25,100 --> 03:03:27,060
You like real men, don't you?

2992
03:03:27,060 --> 03:03:28,060
Yeah.

2993
03:03:28,060 --> 03:03:31,300
I want to punk Obama, you punk.

2994
03:03:31,300 --> 03:03:37,700
I think Obama's doing the punking of us.

2995
03:03:37,700 --> 03:03:38,700
He already did.

2996
03:03:38,700 --> 03:03:46,580
Look how those kids got killed in that school and he wasn't, I mean the tears look like,

2997
03:03:46,580 --> 03:03:52,260
you know, just dripping, but if I was a president and the man killed them kids like that, do

2998
03:03:52,260 --> 03:03:54,340
you know what I would have did?

2999
03:03:54,340 --> 03:03:55,340
Huh?

3000
03:03:55,340 --> 03:03:56,340
What?

3001
03:03:56,340 --> 03:04:00,340
I would have punked his ass by the balls, right in front of America.

3002
03:04:00,340 --> 03:04:03,740
I would have hung them straight up, see what you did?

3003
03:04:03,740 --> 03:04:09,100
Now look here, and all the boys there with the fruit rolls in their babies.

3004
03:04:09,100 --> 03:04:14,620
Could you imagine coming home, and I got five kids, I sent my kid thinking he's safe in

3005
03:04:14,620 --> 03:04:15,620
school.

3006
03:04:15,620 --> 03:04:20,380
Well hey, it's the government that advertises the place to go kill people is at a school

3007
03:04:20,380 --> 03:04:24,460
and then they take all the guns out and don't let the principals or anybody have guns.

3008
03:04:24,460 --> 03:04:28,020
The answer is they have instant access pistol safes that are biometric, you lay your hand

3009
03:04:28,020 --> 03:04:29,020
on it and it pops open.

3010
03:04:29,020 --> 03:04:30,380
I got them at home.

3011
03:04:30,380 --> 03:04:35,420
And I've also got a type of code into it, bam, bam, bam, boom, drawer pops open.

3012
03:04:35,420 --> 03:04:36,420
But you know what?

3013
03:04:36,420 --> 03:04:38,220
I'm really getting on you now.

3014
03:04:38,220 --> 03:04:42,580
I'm on the Alex Jones show now, because what you're saying is true.

3015
03:04:42,580 --> 03:04:47,860
Now I'm in Ohio, and I'm born and raised in the Heights, Cleveland Heights.

3016
03:04:47,860 --> 03:04:50,340
In Cleveland Heights, you got metal detectors and all that.

3017
03:04:50,340 --> 03:04:51,980
Hold on, I want to hear this when we get a break.

3018
03:04:51,980 --> 03:04:53,540
All the breaks are at the end of the hour, start of the hour.

3019
03:04:53,540 --> 03:04:55,500
She's like, what's going on with all these ads during the break?

3020
03:04:55,500 --> 03:04:56,580
It's commercial radio.

3021
03:04:56,580 --> 03:04:58,640
Most radio has 16 minutes of ads.

3022
03:04:58,640 --> 03:04:59,640
We only have 14.

3023
03:04:59,640 --> 03:05:00,640
I'm letting the audience know.

3024
03:05:00,640 --> 03:05:02,940
We'll be right back with Obama phone.

3025
03:05:02,940 --> 03:05:05,180
Hello, I'm Alex Jones.

3026
03:05:05,180 --> 03:05:11,460
Myself, my family, the Infowars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we

3027
03:05:11,460 --> 03:05:16,460

03:05:22,100 --> 03:05:23,100

people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.

3032
03:05:34,360 --> 03:05:37,820
We need your help to spread the word like never before.

3033
03:05:37,820 --> 03:05:44,020
They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.

3034
03:05:44,020 --> 03:05:51,500
You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization

3035
03:05:51,500 --> 03:05:52,980
and ultimate extermination.

3036
03:05:52,980 --> 03:05:55,380
The war is here.

3037
03:05:55,380 --> 03:06:04,780
It's an Infowar, the spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.

3038

3052
03:06:59,180 --> 03:07:03,140
natural healthcare industry.

3053
03:07:03,140 --> 03:07:05,380
It's time for a home security quiz.

3054
03:07:05,380 --> 03:07:06,380
Answer this.

3055
03:07:06,380 --> 03:07:10,580
What effective home security device is smaller than a coffee cup fakes out burglars into

3056
03:07:10,580 --> 03:07:15,180
thinking someone is home at your house while you're away, plugs into any wall outlet, is

3057
03:07:15,180 --> 03:07:19,460
recommended by many police departments and sells for less than $35?

3058
03:07:19,460 --> 03:07:22,060
Yes, it's fake TV.

3059
03:07:22,060 --> 03:07:26,420
This year, about one in every 50 U.S. homes will have a break-in, with burglars usually

3060
03:07:26,420 --> 03:07:30,880
picking the easy target, a dark house that looks like no one is home.

3061
03:07:30,880 --> 03:07:35,780
Fake TV is a small electronic security device that makes it look like someone is home watching

3062
03:07:35,780 --> 03:07:38,860
TV by simulating the light from a real TV.

3063
03:07:38,860 --> 03:07:41,860
It's like a lamp on a timer, but far more convincing.

3064
03:07:41,860 --> 03:07:46,580
And for only $34.95, fake TV could be the difference between coming home to a secure

3065
03:07:46,580 --> 03:07:48,860
house or one that's been ransacked.

3066
03:07:48,860 --> 03:07:54,140
Go to faketv.com or call 1-877-5FAKETV.

3067
03:07:54,140 --> 03:07:57,820
That's 877-532-5388.

3068
03:07:57,820 --> 03:08:00,060
Or go to faketv.com.

3069
03:08:00,060 --> 03:08:02,900
Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.

3070
03:08:02,900 --> 03:08:13,060
Ladies and gentlemen, directly from Cleveland, Ohio.

3071
03:08:13,060 --> 03:08:40,020
All right, we had a good time last night.

3072
03:08:40,020 --> 03:08:42,700
A lot of folks will ask, hey, we've had all this hardcore news.

3073
03:08:42,700 --> 03:08:43,700
All this stuff's going on.

3074
03:08:43,700 --> 03:08:45,060
Why is the Obama phone lady here?

3075
03:08:45,060 --> 03:08:47,660
And some thought, oh, he's gonna get her there and be mean to her.

3076
03:08:47,660 --> 03:08:49,980
No, I said, I bet she's a really interesting lady.

3077
03:08:49,980 --> 03:08:52,380
I could just tell from that video.

3078
03:08:52,380 --> 03:08:56,040
And I wanna try to say, listen, I get that Romney's not good either.

3079
03:08:56,040 --> 03:08:58,800
But let's just admit Obama doesn't care about us.

3080
03:08:58,800 --> 03:09:02,860
Let's just admit he's bought and paid for by a corrupt special interest.

3081
03:09:02,860 --> 03:09:06,340
Let's just admit they're trying to divide and conquer us.

3082
03:09:06,340 --> 03:09:09,840
And while we've been sitting here, I've been convincing you on the Second Amendment.

3083
03:09:09,840 --> 03:09:11,420
I've been convincing you on a bunch of other stuff.

3084
03:09:11,420 --> 03:09:14,420
And you were saying before the break, and we're going back to calls and Twitter questions

3085
03:09:14,420 --> 03:09:15,420
here.

3086
03:09:15,420 --> 03:09:18,460
And again, if you don't know who she is, folks, you know the thing about Obama.

3087
03:09:18,460 --> 03:09:20,580
I'm an Obama phone lady.

3088
03:09:20,580 --> 03:09:23,100
He gave us, well, repeat yourself there so they know who you are.

3089
03:09:23,100 --> 03:09:24,100
I'm an Obama phone lady.

3090
03:09:24,100 --> 03:09:27,380
He gave us a phone and he's gonna do more.

3091
03:09:27,380 --> 03:09:30,380
And now you're saying the government should actually only tax us to give us M-16s.

3092
03:09:30,380 --> 03:09:33,900
Oh, he should give me a gun and some grenades.

3093
03:09:33,900 --> 03:09:38,140
You know, you taking it away, but we need our force here too.

3094
03:09:38,140 --> 03:09:40,180
There you go, ladies and gentlemen.

3095
03:09:40,180 --> 03:09:42,620
No, but seriously, you wanted to say something about the Second Amendment.

3096
03:09:42,620 --> 03:09:47,500
I was pointing out that they've made the schools victim disarmament zones, then they advertise

3097
03:09:47,500 --> 03:09:48,500
for crazy people.

3098
03:09:48,500 --> 03:09:49,660
Hey, don't just kill yourself.

3099
03:09:49,660 --> 03:09:52,160
The option is going down to a school and do it.

3100
03:09:52,160 --> 03:09:54,500
That's what the real tough guys do.

3101
03:09:54,500 --> 03:09:58,860
I think that sucks because here we is, I got kids.

3102
03:09:58,860 --> 03:10:02,060
I put my kids in school and the first thing I think they're safe.

3103
03:10:02,060 --> 03:10:03,660
They're at school.

3104
03:10:03,660 --> 03:10:06,520
When I was growing up, they didn't have all this going on.

3105
03:10:06,520 --> 03:10:11,940
And I'm really believing you, the government, you gotta have control of it.

3106
03:10:11,940 --> 03:10:15,820
You know, that guy killed those kids in that school just recently.

3107
03:10:15,820 --> 03:10:20,380
If I was the president, I would put him on a bus and put his whole body up there, hung

3108
03:10:20,380 --> 03:10:23,380
him upside down, straight out.

3109
03:10:23,380 --> 03:10:24,380
And they're gonna do it.

3110
03:10:24,380 --> 03:10:28,180
He's gonna do it in jail and they're gonna take 15 years to give them time and just sit

3111
03:10:28,180 --> 03:10:29,180
and rot.

3112
03:10:29,180 --> 03:10:30,300
I'm gonna rot all right.

3113
03:10:30,300 --> 03:10:32,220
Killed those innocent kids.

3114
03:10:32,220 --> 03:10:34,340
But see, they use that and dangle them out in front of us.

3115
03:10:34,340 --> 03:10:37,340
And meanwhile, the president signs weekly the death orders where they'll blow up a whole

3116
03:10:37,340 --> 03:10:41,340
apartment building or a whole village or a whole wedding to get one guy who hadn't even

3117
03:10:41,340 --> 03:10:45,660
been convicted, illegally bombing another country and they blow those little kids arms

3118
03:10:45,660 --> 03:10:46,660
and legs off.

3119
03:10:46,660 --> 03:10:47,940
And Obama didn't cry about that.

3120
03:10:47,940 --> 03:10:49,340
My point is that they're cold blooded.

3121
03:10:49,340 --> 03:10:53,780
Did you know our government runs Al Qaeda in Libya and Syria now publicly?

3122
03:10:53,780 --> 03:10:56,900
And Obama went in and murdered Gaddafi.

3123
03:10:56,900 --> 03:11:00,420
And again, he wasn't a perfect guy, but compared to Al Qaeda, he'd been friends with the West

3124
03:11:00,420 --> 03:11:01,420
for about a decade.

3125
03:11:01,420 --> 03:11:02,420
You know, Gaddafi was-

3126
03:11:02,420 --> 03:11:07,060
I believe that, I believe he just did that to get where he got, where he's at.

3127
03:11:07,060 --> 03:11:09,980
He did that to talk to the people just like when I did.

3128
03:11:09,980 --> 03:11:14,620
I didn't know what Alex Jones teaching me about what's on TV.

3129
03:11:14,620 --> 03:11:15,940
But I seen it with my own eyes.

3130
03:11:15,940 --> 03:11:18,700
You pulled it up on YouTube or the TV thing.

3131
03:11:18,700 --> 03:11:19,700
Obama line?

3132
03:11:19,700 --> 03:11:20,700
Right, and it came up.

3133
03:11:20,700 --> 03:11:23,620
That was Obama saying what he won't do with the taxes.

3134
03:11:23,620 --> 03:11:28,420
Here I am just got a job as a maid and my first check is eating me to taxes, eating

3135
03:11:28,420 --> 03:11:30,460
the hell out of me.

3136
03:11:30,460 --> 03:11:31,460
First check.

3137
03:11:31,460 --> 03:11:32,460
It's going up.

3138
03:11:32,460 --> 03:11:33,460
It's going up.

3139
03:11:33,460 --> 03:11:34,460
But-

3140
03:11:34,460 --> 03:11:35,460
He said he wouldn't do that.

3141
03:11:35,460 --> 03:11:38,140
I seen it right here on your show, Alex Jones' show.

3142
03:11:38,140 --> 03:11:39,820
He said he wouldn't take the taxes.

3143
03:11:39,820 --> 03:11:44,980
But exactly, but just 20 years ago, if a president did that, they got run out on a rail.

3144
03:11:44,980 --> 03:11:45,980
Right.

3145
03:11:45,980 --> 03:11:47,980
There's some, you want to cover some code for you, honey?

3146
03:11:47,980 --> 03:11:49,060
You bet.

3147
03:11:49,060 --> 03:11:50,060
And let's go to calls.

3148
03:11:50,060 --> 03:11:51,060
I'm going to quit hogging her here.

3149
03:11:51,060 --> 03:11:52,060
This is-

3150
03:11:52,060 --> 03:11:53,060
Yeah, let's call some calls.

3151
03:11:53,060 --> 03:11:54,060
Let's go to Mike in Tennessee.

3152
03:11:54,060 --> 03:11:57,540
You're on the air listing on 1600 WMQM.

3153
03:11:57,540 --> 03:11:58,540
Go ahead, sir.

3154
03:11:58,540 --> 03:12:00,540
Good afternoon, Alex and Michelle.

3155
03:12:00,540 --> 03:12:06,380
First, I just real quickly want to say, Michelle, if you haven't seen the Obama deception documentary,

3156
03:12:06,380 --> 03:12:11,900
I highly recommend that Alex gets you a copy of that as well as all of his other documentaries,

3157
03:12:11,900 --> 03:12:16,620
a year subscription to his magazine, as well as access to InfoWars TV that she can view

3158
03:12:16,620 --> 03:12:20,020
from any computer anywhere, including the public libraries.

3159
03:12:20,020 --> 03:12:21,020
Absolutely.

3160
03:12:21,020 --> 03:12:25,020
In fact, you see that magazine there, that was the December issue that we finished the

3161
03:12:25,020 --> 03:12:26,460
last week of November.

3162
03:12:26,460 --> 03:12:30,320
It says this man wants your guns and it says he's going to use executive orders to come

3163
03:12:30,320 --> 03:12:31,320
after our guns.

3164
03:12:31,320 --> 03:12:32,320
How do you think I knew that?

3165
03:12:32,320 --> 03:12:34,180
Because I'm not smart.

3166
03:12:34,180 --> 03:12:35,580
They told us they would do all this.

3167
03:12:35,580 --> 03:12:36,580
They said that.

3168
03:12:36,580 --> 03:12:41,260
I've just seen them said it on the TV and Alex Jones show that he wouldn't raise our

3169
03:12:41,260 --> 03:12:42,260
taxes.

3170
03:12:42,260 --> 03:12:45,420
Exactly, but back then it was only in policy reports.

3171
03:12:45,420 --> 03:12:50,580
See, they're in policy reports like we don't even exist because they know the paid off

3172
03:12:50,580 --> 03:12:53,780
media will never go show their real plans.

3173
03:12:53,780 --> 03:12:55,660
So see, that's why I get so mad.

3174
03:12:55,660 --> 03:12:59,740
I know their whole plan because they wrote it down.

3175
03:12:59,740 --> 03:13:01,460
This is not rocket science.

3176
03:13:01,460 --> 03:13:03,780
I know what I'm talking about because they told me.

3177
03:13:03,780 --> 03:13:05,300
It's like a confession letter.

3178
03:13:05,300 --> 03:13:09,500
It's like a killer who videotapes themselves chopping up some kid and I've got the video

3179
03:13:09,500 --> 03:13:10,500
and I'm like, look, he did it.

3180
03:13:10,500 --> 03:13:11,500
Here's the video.

3181
03:13:11,500 --> 03:13:12,980
Oh, shut up, conspiracy theorist.

3182
03:13:12,980 --> 03:13:13,980
I'm sorry.

3183
03:13:13,980 --> 03:13:14,980
Go ahead.

3184
03:13:14,980 --> 03:13:15,980
Anything else, Mike?

3185
03:13:15,980 --> 03:13:21,780
Michelle, I'm 51 and I grew up in Memphis, Tennessee and I grew up in a neighborhood

3186
03:13:21,780 --> 03:13:25,740
that had black fathers and white fathers that went to work.

3187
03:13:25,740 --> 03:13:29,660
Some were carpenters, some were dentists, some were trash men.

3188
03:13:29,660 --> 03:13:33,780
They came home every night to a house with a wife who'd beat the fool out of the young

3189
03:13:33,780 --> 03:13:37,740
boys if they got out of line and if they were at the neighbor's home, the neighbor's mom

3190
03:13:37,740 --> 03:13:39,980
would get a hold of you, call your mother.

3191
03:13:39,980 --> 03:13:43,260
When you got home, she would get you and when dad got home, it was all over.

3192
03:13:43,260 --> 03:13:47,420
The way they stole your birthright was they took the fathers out of the home, replaced

3193
03:13:47,420 --> 03:13:51,420
them with a welfare check and they- Hallelujah, hallelujah.

3194
03:13:51,420 --> 03:13:52,420
You're exactly right.

3195
03:13:52,420 --> 03:13:56,820
And by the way, Margaret Sanger said, we're going to get these black weeds.

3196
03:13:56,820 --> 03:13:57,820
This is a quote.

3197
03:13:57,820 --> 03:14:01,260
We're going to pay off black leaders and we're going to break up their families and we're

3198
03:14:01,260 --> 03:14:05,020
going to get them dependent and we're going to chop them up, okay?

3199
03:14:05,020 --> 03:14:06,860
And that's what goes on.

3200
03:14:06,860 --> 03:14:10,260
And what they've done, like Tony Brown says in Tony Brown's journal on PBS, what they've

3201
03:14:10,260 --> 03:14:12,320
done to the black community is the model for everybody.

3202
03:14:12,320 --> 03:14:17,300
They just went after you because people would say, well, they don't have rights because

3203
03:14:17,300 --> 03:14:19,940
they use prejudice to hit you from both sides.

3204
03:14:19,940 --> 03:14:24,580
The open prejudice, but then the fake liberals, that's their plan.

3205
03:14:24,580 --> 03:14:29,820
And so my whole point is, is that they've gone from 10% illegitimacy to 90 plus percent

3206
03:14:29,820 --> 03:14:30,820
illegitimacy.

3207
03:14:30,820 --> 03:14:34,620
And Dr. Spock in those books, they said, don't spank your kids.

3208
03:14:34,620 --> 03:14:36,660
They said, let your kids do what they want.

3209
03:14:36,660 --> 03:14:38,860
So they'll be out of control.

3210
03:14:38,860 --> 03:14:42,020
So now they get tasered and shot by the cops.

3211
03:14:42,020 --> 03:14:48,220
Now their father figure is a big fat fake gangster, like Freeway Ricky Ross, not the

3212
03:14:48,220 --> 03:14:49,740
real Freeway Ricky.

3213
03:14:49,740 --> 03:14:52,780
Rick Ross, the fake guy, not even a real gangster.

3214
03:14:52,780 --> 03:14:55,140
By the way, he runs and hides from real gangsters.

3215
03:14:55,140 --> 03:14:59,040
He's up there saying the tough thing to do, kill, steal, do all this.

3216
03:14:59,040 --> 03:15:00,740
People think that's what we're supposed to do.

3217
03:15:00,740 --> 03:15:05,660
You basically put on a gangster uniform for the cops now to alert who are trained on you.

3218
03:15:05,660 --> 03:15:07,680
They're like attack dogs trained to get a rabbit.

3219
03:15:07,680 --> 03:15:12,220
You put on a rabbit's uniform to be sent to a prison where they then put everybody racially

3220
03:15:12,220 --> 03:15:16,680
in their gangs to create a race system of divide and conquer.

3221
03:15:16,680 --> 03:15:21,460
The real colleges in America are the prisons designed, what this guy's saying right here,

3222
03:15:21,460 --> 03:15:24,660
to destroy the birthright, to destroy the father.

3223
03:15:24,660 --> 03:15:27,760
And they've now done it, and they're doing it to everybody.

3224
03:15:27,760 --> 03:15:29,320
And that's what Obama's there to do.

3225
03:15:29,320 --> 03:15:34,220
You know Obama got all the money increased to make sure they abort more people.

3226
03:15:34,220 --> 03:15:35,900
And folks say, well, look how bad the communities are.

3227
03:15:35,900 --> 03:15:37,000
Let's abort these people.

3228
03:15:37,000 --> 03:15:38,300
See how they've sold us on that?

3229
03:15:38,300 --> 03:15:41,180
He says, hey, let's kill people.

3230
03:15:41,180 --> 03:15:44,340
Because if we kill an old lady and don't give her healthcare, we can hire teachers.

3231
03:15:44,340 --> 03:15:48,300
Now we've got the idea of killing people to get a job, when all we ever needed was liberty

3232
03:15:48,300 --> 03:15:51,340
and freedom and self-sufficiency.

3233
03:15:51,340 --> 03:15:53,760
But now we've had the self-sufficiency destroyed.

3234
03:15:53,760 --> 03:15:56,560
Now they've got us right where they want us, Michelle.

3235
03:15:56,560 --> 03:15:57,560
They think they do.

3236
03:15:57,560 --> 03:15:58,620
Anything else, caller?

3237
03:15:58,620 --> 03:16:00,180
You're laying out the genius here.

3238
03:16:00,180 --> 03:16:01,180
Mike.

3239
03:16:01,180 --> 03:16:06,020
Their biggest fear is independence and people taking individual responsibility.

3240
03:16:06,020 --> 03:16:10,900
And once you give up the Obama phone bobble, you take back your rightful place as a sovereign

3241
03:16:10,900 --> 03:16:14,300
human being, a child of God, they lose.

3242
03:16:14,300 --> 03:16:15,940
Right, they lose.

3243
03:16:15,940 --> 03:16:16,940
That's right.

3244
03:16:16,940 --> 03:16:23,860
Remember, the slicker devil, I mean Mitt Romney's trying to talk to mainline, middle class people,

3245
03:16:23,860 --> 03:16:24,860
whatever color they are.

3246
03:16:24,860 --> 03:16:26,660
He's like, I don't care about 47%.

3247
03:16:26,660 --> 03:16:27,660
They're gonna do whatever.

3248
03:16:27,660 --> 03:16:30,980
He goes, I'll keep your taxes low.

3249
03:16:30,980 --> 03:16:32,840
But his plan was to raise them too.

3250
03:16:32,840 --> 03:16:36,560
He's there to con the middle class and the white people and the wealthy black folks and

3251
03:16:36,560 --> 03:16:41,380
all the people that have made some money, okay, that get the government in their friend.

3252
03:16:41,380 --> 03:16:45,860
But just he'll tell them what they wanna hear, and then they can put Obama in and say it's

3253
03:16:45,860 --> 03:16:50,180
a defeat for the ideas Mitt Romney put out that weren't his real plans.

3254
03:16:50,180 --> 03:16:51,180
Right.

3255
03:16:51,180 --> 03:16:55,680
You see, it wasn't just rigged in getting Obama in, okay?

3256
03:16:55,680 --> 03:17:00,000
It was rigged in that they ran somebody who was a phony up against him to begin with.

3257
03:17:00,000 --> 03:17:02,780
Because they want you to believe in the system.

3258
03:17:02,780 --> 03:17:06,140
Cuz it's not enough for them to distill your future.

3259
03:17:06,140 --> 03:17:07,660
They want you to beg for it.

3260
03:17:07,660 --> 03:17:08,660
You understand that?

3261
03:17:08,660 --> 03:17:09,660
Right, right, right.

3262
03:17:09,660 --> 03:17:10,660
I do believe that.

3263
03:17:10,660 --> 03:17:12,220
Cuz it's free will universe.

3264
03:17:12,220 --> 03:17:13,220
Right.

3265
03:17:13,220 --> 03:17:16,380
And I'm not trying to preach at you, but I wanted to get you here because I could tell

3266
03:17:16,380 --> 03:17:17,380
you were an interesting lady.

3267
03:17:17,380 --> 03:17:18,380
Right.

3268
03:17:18,380 --> 03:17:20,620
And I really wanted to communicate with you at point blank range.

3269
03:17:20,620 --> 03:17:21,860
And I'm glad you did.

3270
03:17:21,860 --> 03:17:22,860
Sir, good points.

3271
03:17:22,860 --> 03:17:24,700
Let's get another caller here in overdrive.

3272
03:17:24,700 --> 03:17:27,340
We're gonna skip this network break coming up.

3273
03:17:27,340 --> 03:17:28,980
Key in New York, you're on the air.

3274
03:17:28,980 --> 03:17:29,980
Go ahead.

3275
03:17:29,980 --> 03:17:32,660
Hey, how are you doing, Michelle?

3276
03:17:32,660 --> 03:17:33,660
Hey, how are you?

3277
03:17:33,660 --> 03:17:34,660
Doing good.

3278
03:17:34,660 --> 03:17:36,100
What's going on, Alex?

3279
03:17:36,100 --> 03:17:37,500
Worldwide broadcast, my friend.

3280
03:17:37,500 --> 03:17:38,500
What's on your mind?

3281
03:17:38,500 --> 03:17:40,500
Yo, you know something, Michelle?

3282
03:17:40,500 --> 03:17:43,620
The only reason why you're there is to be clowned.

3283
03:17:43,620 --> 03:17:45,820
That's the only reason why you're there.

3284
03:17:45,820 --> 03:17:53,780
Before you got there, they played that soundbite of yours over and over and over again to clown

3285
03:17:53,780 --> 03:17:54,780
you.

3286
03:17:54,780 --> 03:18:00,260
And the reason why he's trying to get you to say things is because he needs audio so

3287
03:18:00,260 --> 03:18:03,940
that he can play that back and clown you again when you leave.

3288
03:18:03,940 --> 03:18:08,260
Now, hold on just a second, Key.

3289
03:18:08,260 --> 03:18:09,260
Ain't nobody gonna-

3290
03:18:09,260 --> 03:18:10,260
No, no, but hold on.

3291
03:18:10,260 --> 03:18:15,460
When we called her, and when she got off the plane, I said, I think it's funny.

3292
03:18:15,460 --> 03:18:19,540
And we did make jokes about it because it's funny, but it's also sad.

3293
03:18:19,540 --> 03:18:23,960
And I said that at the time we aired it, if you go back to the first times we aired it,

3294
03:18:23,960 --> 03:18:29,420
and I said I thought she was an interesting lady and was talented and funny.

3295
03:18:29,420 --> 03:18:31,460
And I've said, I bet that lady's a character.

3296
03:18:31,460 --> 03:18:35,820
So we've got her here, and I clown around some too.

3297
03:18:35,820 --> 03:18:42,460
So all I'm saying is don't misrepresent what I actually stand for and what I believe in.

3298
03:18:42,460 --> 03:18:48,700
I mean, it is horrible that they're trying to domesticate us, and I'm here actually trying

3299
03:18:48,700 --> 03:18:52,740
to reach out to her to try to explain to her why we need a Second Amendment and things

3300
03:18:52,740 --> 03:18:54,860
like that, okay?

3301
03:18:54,860 --> 03:18:58,920
And obviously, I said I want that lady on the show months ago, and then I made kind

3302
03:18:58,920 --> 03:19:02,260
of a joke about it saying, okay, a bounty to get her on if somebody can find her.

3303
03:19:02,260 --> 03:19:03,260
And we got her on.

3304
03:19:03,260 --> 03:19:05,340
Is this not interesting radio, sir?

3305
03:19:05,340 --> 03:19:10,820
No, he's a chronic clown, and I can prove it to you that he isn't what he purports to

3306
03:19:10,820 --> 03:19:11,820
be.

3307
03:19:11,820 --> 03:19:12,820
You call him Obama, punk.

3308
03:19:12,820 --> 03:19:13,820
Well, check this out.

3309
03:19:13,820 --> 03:19:14,820
Alex said that you had 1776 all in Piers Morgan's space.

3310
03:19:14,820 --> 03:19:15,820
Oh, you're not going to take our guns because this is going to happen.

3311
03:19:15,820 --> 03:19:30,820
All of a sudden, Alex said if the ATF shows up at his house, he's not going to shoot back.

3312
03:19:30,820 --> 03:19:36,060
But the Ruby Ritz cats, they went for this.

3313
03:19:36,060 --> 03:19:40,100
Now they died, but they did what they said they were going to do.

3314
03:19:40,100 --> 03:19:45,660
But Alex said no, he's just driving to his knees.

3315
03:19:45,660 --> 03:19:46,660
You know what?

3316
03:19:46,660 --> 03:19:47,660
You know what?

3317
03:19:47,660 --> 03:19:55,780
You're wrong, and I appreciate your call, and I am here on the front lines trying to

3318
03:19:55,780 --> 03:20:00,720
peacefully cause a cultural revolution 1776 worldwide.

3319
03:20:00,720 --> 03:20:06,340
And I know that they want to come set me up, and so I've always said the same thing.

3320
03:20:06,340 --> 03:20:10,380
If you come for the guns, it's going to cause a revolution.

3321
03:20:10,380 --> 03:20:13,300
But I'm not going to give them an excuse before that happens.

3322
03:20:13,300 --> 03:20:16,460
A, I want to stop it, and I've been clear about that.

3323
03:20:16,460 --> 03:20:22,700
B, I am trying to fix things peacefully, and I'm not going to give them the excuse.

3324
03:20:22,700 --> 03:20:25,940
I have said I'm not turning my guns in, period.

3325
03:20:25,940 --> 03:20:28,880
I don't care what phony executive orders they do.

3326
03:20:28,880 --> 03:20:32,500
But I've also said that I'm not going to open the door for them, that if they do come to

3327
03:20:32,500 --> 03:20:36,460
my house and kill me, to sit there and have me shooting my mouth off, that I'm going to

3328
03:20:36,460 --> 03:20:38,140
do this and that to the cops.

3329
03:20:38,140 --> 03:20:41,520
If they do come and kill me, it'll be in cold blood, and I'll be a martyr.

3330
03:20:41,520 --> 03:20:42,520
That's the opposite.

3331
03:20:42,520 --> 03:20:44,780
I mean, I'm Alex Jones.

3332
03:20:44,780 --> 03:20:46,780
On the air, I don't have bodyguards.

3333
03:20:46,780 --> 03:20:48,220
I go out and do all this.

3334
03:20:48,220 --> 03:20:52,580
I deal with this, and you're calling up saying that basically I'm a coward.

3335
03:20:52,580 --> 03:20:55,420
And anyone listening knows that that's not the case.

3336
03:20:55,420 --> 03:20:59,260
I mean, I march into the lion's den and get in people's face.

3337
03:20:59,260 --> 03:21:04,260
And I mean, it's just amazing, instead of just making fun of this lady from afar, I

3338
03:21:04,260 --> 03:21:05,260
got her.

3339
03:21:05,260 --> 03:21:06,260
Did I not tell you last night?

3340
03:21:06,260 --> 03:21:07,740
What did I tell you when you got off the plane?

3341
03:21:07,740 --> 03:21:09,180
Well, it's not about what you said.

3342
03:21:09,180 --> 03:21:12,180
I've been did it before I got to the Alex Jones show.

3343
03:21:12,180 --> 03:21:18,580
I even had my TV show in Cleveland, Ohio, Channel 19, and I turned them down.

3344
03:21:18,580 --> 03:21:23,260
But one thing about it, and two for show, if you see it with your own eyes and then

3345
03:21:23,260 --> 03:21:25,740
you know what you did, you know it's a game.

3346
03:21:25,740 --> 03:21:29,220
He did that probably to get me out there to get the voters to vote for him.

3347
03:21:29,220 --> 03:21:32,940
No, I know, but I mean, obviously, it's hilarious.

3348
03:21:32,940 --> 03:21:33,940
I mean, I'm-

3349
03:21:33,940 --> 03:21:35,700
I mean, I think it's funny because it's-

3350
03:21:35,700 --> 03:21:39,620
But I mean, I said on air, I said you could do voiceovers.

3351
03:21:39,620 --> 03:21:40,620
I mean, that's like a-

3352
03:21:40,620 --> 03:21:41,620
I could be a comedian.

3353
03:21:41,620 --> 03:21:42,620
That's like a Muppet character.

3354
03:21:42,620 --> 03:21:44,100
I mean, I'm gonna be honest with you, right?

3355
03:21:44,100 --> 03:21:45,820
I'm telling you where your talents are.

3356
03:21:45,820 --> 03:21:48,420
When you get upset and talk, I mean, it sounds like a Muppet.

3357
03:21:48,420 --> 03:21:52,060
I mean, you could go make money as a Muppet.

3358
03:21:52,060 --> 03:21:53,060
Okay.

3359
03:21:53,060 --> 03:21:54,060
You could play with that.

3360
03:21:54,060 --> 03:21:58,500
Well, but listen, the point is I do, the thing is I do Marvin the Martian voices.

3361
03:21:58,500 --> 03:21:59,500
Right.

3362
03:21:59,500 --> 03:22:00,500
I can do Muppet voices.

3363
03:22:00,500 --> 03:22:03,340
I mean, I'm saying, I said at the time, that's an interesting lady.

3364
03:22:03,340 --> 03:22:07,560
There's plenty of people on the news saying I want Obama in cuz I want free stuff.

3365
03:22:07,560 --> 03:22:09,100
We played like 10 clips of that.

3366
03:22:09,100 --> 03:22:13,380
None of those got 20 million views because they didn't have that spark.

3367
03:22:13,380 --> 03:22:14,380
That's the spark.

3368
03:22:14,380 --> 03:22:22,740
And everybody told me, even when I got on YouTube, first thing they said, wow, you were

3369
03:22:22,740 --> 03:22:23,740
so funny.

3370
03:22:23,740 --> 03:22:24,740
The way you said it.

3371
03:22:24,740 --> 03:22:28,580
Tell me your phone and you can do more.

3372
03:22:28,580 --> 03:22:32,780
You know, that was- But didn't I tell you that I thought it was

3373
03:22:32,780 --> 03:22:34,260
funny and that I disagreed with it?

3374
03:22:34,260 --> 03:22:35,260
Oh, yeah.

3375
03:22:35,260 --> 03:22:36,780
And I told John to tell you that on the phone.

3376
03:22:36,780 --> 03:22:39,300
Well, see, when I- What did we tell you about getting the, I mean, we were honest about

3377
03:22:39,300 --> 03:22:40,300
it.

3378
03:22:40,300 --> 03:22:41,300
Right.

3379
03:22:41,300 --> 03:22:43,980
The point is my attacker is always obsessed on saying, I'm not bona fide.

3380
03:22:43,980 --> 03:22:45,060
I'm not real.

3381
03:22:45,060 --> 03:22:46,420
I'm disingenuous.

3382
03:22:46,420 --> 03:22:51,020
When it's the opposite- It's real as an Alex Jones show.

3383
03:22:51,020 --> 03:22:52,020
You're real?

3384
03:22:52,020 --> 03:22:53,300
Well, that's what I like is things that are real.

3385
03:22:53,300 --> 03:22:58,700
Then if you don't know a man like you showed me sitting in his office-

3386
03:22:58,700 --> 03:22:59,700
Well, exactly.

3387
03:22:59,700 --> 03:23:02,740
And I mean- They wasn't going to raise and cut my tax.

3388
03:23:02,740 --> 03:23:04,460
You know why you're here?

3389
03:23:04,460 --> 03:23:10,300
Because when I'm at literally having Thanksgiving or Christmas, we're sitting around talking

3390
03:23:10,300 --> 03:23:11,300
about you.

3391
03:23:11,300 --> 03:23:12,300
Uh-huh.

3392
03:23:12,300 --> 03:23:14,060
And everybody- I'm the only one.

3393
03:23:14,060 --> 03:23:15,900
Everybody's talking about the bomber phone lady.

3394
03:23:15,900 --> 03:23:17,100
That's why I'm- I know.

3395
03:23:17,100 --> 03:23:19,780
So the guy's trying to make it some evil thing to get you here.

3396
03:23:19,780 --> 03:23:20,780
A lot of people is.

3397
03:23:20,780 --> 03:23:23,060
A lot of people saying, I showed my butt doing this.

3398
03:23:23,060 --> 03:23:24,940
Well, the point is, is that so what?

3399
03:23:24,940 --> 03:23:25,940
You were in the arena.

3400
03:23:25,940 --> 03:23:26,940
Wait a minute.

3401
03:23:26,940 --> 03:23:27,940
You were on the field.

3402
03:23:27,940 --> 03:23:34,940
If I die tomorrow, my grandkids can go on YouTube and say, my granny did something on

3403
03:23:34,940 --> 03:23:36,780
YouTube, Obama phone lady.

3404
03:23:36,780 --> 03:23:38,140
Well, let me be clear too.

3405
03:23:38,140 --> 03:23:43,300
I don't- The family I come from, my family's all like, you better be nice to that lady.

3406
03:23:43,300 --> 03:23:44,300
And I'm like, how dare you?

3407
03:23:44,300 --> 03:23:46,220
You heard me on the phone with my wife last night.

3408
03:23:46,220 --> 03:23:47,220
Right.

3409
03:23:47,220 --> 03:23:49,340
Don't say I'm on purpose trying to be mean to her.

3410
03:23:49,340 --> 03:23:53,380
I mean, I said, obviously, obviously, I don't agree with what they've done.

3411
03:23:53,380 --> 03:23:55,820
I don't agree with getting free Obama phones.

3412
03:23:55,820 --> 03:23:58,060
It's selling our souls so cheaply.

3413
03:23:58,060 --> 03:24:00,480
I'm here telling you honestly, I think this is horrible.

3414
03:24:00,480 --> 03:24:02,740
And you're here understanding what I'm saying.

3415
03:24:02,740 --> 03:24:05,580
And we're trying to figure out ways for- But you just said it-

3416
03:24:05,580 --> 03:24:08,420
I fight as hard as I can to try to keep jobs in this country.

3417
03:24:08,420 --> 03:24:13,300
I've napped in- Well, just now you showed that clipping of- and that's so true.

3418
03:24:13,300 --> 03:24:19,380
Looks like he just showed us how we get a, what you call it, Happy Meal, a cheeseburger

3419
03:24:19,380 --> 03:24:20,380
and a fry.

3420
03:24:20,380 --> 03:24:23,620
I'm black, low clap, low po.

3421
03:24:23,620 --> 03:24:24,620
Obama lady.

3422
03:24:24,620 --> 03:24:30,180
Instead of buying a Happy Meal, a cheeseburger and a fry for two bucks, that toy that probably

3423
03:24:30,180 --> 03:24:36,540
get a million of them, pay one price, throw it in the bag, and the kid is happy.

3424
03:24:36,540 --> 03:24:37,540
That's example.

3425
03:24:37,540 --> 03:24:39,180
Same thing for me.

3426
03:24:39,180 --> 03:24:44,660
They threw me a Obama phone, and more than us, there's so many minorities that I helped

3427
03:24:44,660 --> 03:24:50,180
sign up to vote for Obama about that Obama phone, that they didn't even come from Obama.

3428
03:24:50,180 --> 03:24:55,420
So I made myself look stupid because when I was canvassing, they didn't tell me about

3429
03:24:55,420 --> 03:24:56,420
the Obama phone.

3430
03:24:56,420 --> 03:25:01,780
If I never went to a canvas for Obama, first thing everybody I know say, they call him

3431
03:25:01,780 --> 03:25:03,020
Obama phone.

3432
03:25:03,020 --> 03:25:04,020
Exactly.

3433
03:25:04,020 --> 03:25:07,460
What they want is they want to get everybody on the dole so these big mega banks can skim

3434
03:25:07,460 --> 03:25:09,620
and decide where the contracts go.

3435
03:25:09,620 --> 03:25:10,900
It's all mafia.

3436
03:25:10,900 --> 03:25:12,660
Let me go over some of these questions and people are gonna kill me.

3437
03:25:12,660 --> 03:25:14,300
I've got a whole, where do they go?

3438
03:25:14,300 --> 03:25:15,300
Here they are.

3439
03:25:15,300 --> 03:25:18,260
These are Twitter questions from real Alex Jones.

3440
03:25:18,260 --> 03:25:21,820
Why and what made you go on the Alex Jones show?

3441
03:25:21,820 --> 03:25:24,380
Why did you say no to the other shows, but you said yes to ours?

3442
03:25:24,380 --> 03:25:30,480
Well for one, I said yes to Alex Jones show because when you called me and talked to me,

3443
03:25:30,480 --> 03:25:33,900
there was a man that approached, excuse me, approached me.

3444
03:25:33,900 --> 03:25:39,980
So you had already been looking for me and here I am in Cleveland and you're in Texas.

3445
03:25:39,980 --> 03:25:44,260
They was right there in Cleveland looking for me and no one came to me like you did

3446
03:25:44,260 --> 03:25:45,260
Alex Jones.

3447
03:25:45,260 --> 03:25:49,660
And I don't care how stupid the video look or whatever they said about the video.

3448
03:25:49,660 --> 03:25:54,540
You was the first one made me feel welcome and to learn more about what's going on.

3449
03:25:54,540 --> 03:25:56,180
Well the thing is you're a real person.

3450
03:25:56,180 --> 03:25:57,820
You're funny, you're talented.

3451
03:25:57,820 --> 03:25:58,820
You have that pizazz.

3452
03:25:58,820 --> 03:26:01,740
But yeah, it's horrible what's happening, how they're buying us off with this stuff

3453
03:26:01,740 --> 03:26:05,100
and trying to make us dependent where there are no jobs, so you got to go on welfare.

3454
03:26:05,100 --> 03:26:06,100
This is all we talk about.

3455
03:26:06,100 --> 03:26:10,900
I mean, here I am talking about let's not let the eugenicists target black people.

3456
03:26:10,900 --> 03:26:15,060
And this guy calls up and says, you're clowning this lady.

3457
03:26:15,060 --> 03:26:16,220
And obviously we're all-

3458
03:26:16,220 --> 03:26:19,660
But I wanted to say what I really wanted to tell him and you wouldn't let me tell him.

3459
03:26:19,660 --> 03:26:20,660
What was that?

3460
03:26:20,660 --> 03:26:21,660
Go ahead.

3461
03:26:21,660 --> 03:26:25,780
Well if he wanted to clown me, but you got to also look at it is same thing they did

3462
03:26:25,780 --> 03:26:29,820
it to get his votes and like you did about the bag they threw the toy in.

3463
03:26:29,820 --> 03:26:30,820
We're all getting clowned.

3464
03:26:30,820 --> 03:26:32,180
We're all getting clowned.

3465
03:26:32,180 --> 03:26:35,820
I'm the Obama phone lady and if I got clowned by that, guess what?

3466
03:26:35,820 --> 03:26:38,700
I'm going to get what I need to get through.

3467
03:26:38,700 --> 03:26:39,700
That's the main thing.

3468
03:26:39,700 --> 03:26:41,540
And to know the right from the wrong-

3469
03:26:41,540 --> 03:26:43,940
Only people that don't get clowned are folks that don't ever do anything.

3470
03:26:43,940 --> 03:26:44,940
Right.

3471
03:26:44,940 --> 03:26:45,940
And see, I do a lot.

3472
03:26:45,940 --> 03:26:46,940
I'm right now.

3473
03:26:46,940 --> 03:26:50,500
Like I said, I'm a single parent with five kids.

3474
03:26:50,500 --> 03:26:52,580
I do a lot and I need to get through a lot.

3475
03:26:52,580 --> 03:26:55,220
I'm 47 years old, how long we last?

3476
03:26:55,220 --> 03:26:57,400
We don't last long.

3477
03:26:57,400 --> 03:27:01,420
And I don't care what you said about that call because whatever it took on you two,

3478
03:27:01,420 --> 03:27:02,420
you seen it.

3479
03:27:02,420 --> 03:27:04,260
And if I look like that much of a fool, where you at?

3480
03:27:04,260 --> 03:27:05,660
You're a fool with me.

3481
03:27:05,660 --> 03:27:09,860
But again, there's lots of people begging for, you know, saying I got this free thing.

3482
03:27:09,860 --> 03:27:10,980
Those didn't get popular.

3483
03:27:10,980 --> 03:27:11,980
It's because it's funny.

3484
03:27:11,980 --> 03:27:14,180
Here, here, and it's funny because the way you deliver it.

3485
03:27:14,180 --> 03:27:15,180
Now there's another one.

3486
03:27:15,180 --> 03:27:17,940
Why do you think he's paying for that phone?

3487
03:27:17,940 --> 03:27:21,060
Do you think it's fair that they take money from somebody else?

3488
03:27:21,060 --> 03:27:22,060
No, I don't.

3489
03:27:22,060 --> 03:27:26,100
They could have used that money to give me a gun and a grenade to help save my soul.

3490
03:27:26,100 --> 03:27:29,300
If it wasn't for me, it'd blow me down.

3491
03:27:29,300 --> 03:27:30,940
The Obama phone, lady.

3492
03:27:30,940 --> 03:27:32,980
Here's something else.

3493
03:27:32,980 --> 03:27:33,980
Oh my gosh.

3494
03:27:33,980 --> 03:27:35,180
You got to be like that.

3495
03:27:35,180 --> 03:27:37,740
You see how that caller just did us?

3496
03:27:37,740 --> 03:27:38,740
Here's that same question.

3497
03:27:38,740 --> 03:27:39,740
Do you want a free firearm?

3498
03:27:39,740 --> 03:27:40,900
I hadn't even read these yet.

3499
03:27:40,900 --> 03:27:44,140
How do you feel about the tax increases on more than 77 percent of Americans?

3500
03:27:44,140 --> 03:27:45,460
We already talked about that.

3501
03:27:45,460 --> 03:27:48,860
Why are you, who are you going to vote for in 2016?

3502
03:27:48,860 --> 03:27:50,420
It darn sure won't be Obama.

3503
03:27:50,420 --> 03:27:51,420
I don't know.

3504
03:27:51,420 --> 03:27:53,460
They're talking about a third term for him.

3505
03:27:53,460 --> 03:27:55,020
Well, I don't think he's going to last that long.

3506
03:27:55,020 --> 03:27:57,500
I mean, Rahm Emanuel says we don't even need voters anymore.

3507
03:27:57,500 --> 03:27:58,500
Right.

3508
03:27:58,500 --> 03:27:59,500
We just, the police will now run things.

3509
03:27:59,500 --> 03:28:00,500
Right.

3510
03:28:00,500 --> 03:28:04,740
And I do believe that because where I live at and where I was at, the police is running

3511
03:28:04,740 --> 03:28:05,740
it.

3512
03:28:05,740 --> 03:28:06,740
And I've seen it with my own eyes.

3513
03:28:06,740 --> 03:28:11,980
And I'm glad you brought a lot to my attention about that because I've just moved from Cleveland

3514
03:28:11,980 --> 03:28:12,980
Heights to Cleveland.

3515
03:28:12,980 --> 03:28:15,460
Cleveland, you can walk outside butt naked.

3516
03:28:15,460 --> 03:28:19,920
You go to Cleveland Heights, they're going to arrest you, say you raped somebody because

3517
03:28:19,920 --> 03:28:21,380
you're butt naked.

3518
03:28:21,380 --> 03:28:23,740
The police is running it all.

3519
03:28:23,740 --> 03:28:26,220
You know, years ago, my father dead and gone.

3520
03:28:26,220 --> 03:28:30,340
He told me it was going to people, it was going to be people on the devices on the TV

3521
03:28:30,340 --> 03:28:32,540
that they can look through you and see where you at.

3522
03:28:32,540 --> 03:28:36,100
I believe that because now they got them things they put on kids' leg and they look through

3523
03:28:36,100 --> 03:28:37,100
the TV.

3524
03:28:37,100 --> 03:28:38,100
No, no, no.

3525
03:28:38,100 --> 03:28:39,100
Your Obama phone tracks everywhere you go.

3526
03:28:39,100 --> 03:28:40,100
I believe that.

3527
03:28:40,100 --> 03:28:41,820
They dial in and listen to you.

3528
03:28:41,820 --> 03:28:43,300
No, it's horrible.

3529
03:28:43,300 --> 03:28:46,180
They control you because they give you so many minutes a month.

3530
03:28:46,180 --> 03:28:47,180
Do something.

3531
03:28:47,180 --> 03:28:50,460
Here's another caller, the most incredible voice.

3532
03:28:50,460 --> 03:28:56,100
Are you getting job offers for TV, radio, voiceovers, et cetera?

3533
03:28:56,100 --> 03:28:59,820
It says you way better than Piers Morgan.

3534
03:28:59,820 --> 03:29:00,820
Thanks for the comment.

3535
03:29:00,820 --> 03:29:03,620
By the way, folks, I'm telling you, she needs her agent.

3536
03:29:03,620 --> 03:29:04,620
She needs to do voiceovers.

3537
03:29:04,620 --> 03:29:06,660
I guess I'm able because I'm trying to help her.

3538
03:29:06,660 --> 03:29:08,660
Send me an agent out.

3539
03:29:08,660 --> 03:29:10,660
Have you heard about FEMA camps?

3540
03:29:10,660 --> 03:29:12,020
Yes, I did.

3541
03:29:12,020 --> 03:29:13,580
I used FEMA before.

3542
03:29:13,580 --> 03:29:17,220
FEMA is the one to help you if you say your flood is in the basement.

3543
03:29:17,220 --> 03:29:19,260
But they're also the shadow government.

3544
03:29:19,260 --> 03:29:20,820
They're with the government.

3545
03:29:20,820 --> 03:29:22,540
Do you take the flu shot?

3546
03:29:22,540 --> 03:29:23,540
No.

3547
03:29:23,540 --> 03:29:24,540
Why?

3548
03:29:24,540 --> 03:29:25,540
I got faith in God.

3549
03:29:25,540 --> 03:29:26,540
Oh, yeah.

3550
03:29:26,540 --> 03:29:28,540
Well, it never even protects you anyways.

3551
03:29:28,540 --> 03:29:29,540
Right.

3552
03:29:29,540 --> 03:29:30,540
Take it.

3553
03:29:30,540 --> 03:29:33,220
We're going to do more of these questions tonight on the TV show.

3554
03:29:33,220 --> 03:29:34,220
All right now.

3555
03:29:34,220 --> 03:29:35,940
Let you get some late lunch.

3556
03:29:35,940 --> 03:29:36,940
All right.

3557
03:29:36,940 --> 03:29:42,860
And we're going to go back to retransmission covering news from the earlier broadcast here

3558
03:29:42,860 --> 03:29:43,860
and I'll be back tomorrow.

3559
03:29:43,860 --> 03:29:45,620
Live 11 a.m. Central.

3560
03:29:45,620 --> 03:29:47,060
A lot more tonight.

3561
03:29:47,060 --> 03:29:51,140
7 o'clock central, prisonplanet.tv with Obama Phone Lady.

3562
03:29:51,140 --> 03:29:52,140
All right.

3563
03:29:52,140 --> 03:29:53,140
Obama Phone Lady is here.

3564
03:29:53,140 --> 03:29:54,460
We're on the march.

3565
03:29:54,460 --> 03:29:56,860
The empire's on the run.

3566
03:29:56,860 --> 03:30:23,500
Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
