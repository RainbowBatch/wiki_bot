1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:28,880
he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.

3
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:35,440
Ladies and gentlemen, I have had two hours sleep on the plane. Got up at about four this

4
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,240
morning, took about a 30-minute nap in the hotel room. Got up at four because I was working

5
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:44,220
through the night filing videos and then got on the plane, maybe slept an hour and a half.

6
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:51,440
So total of about two hours. So bear with me today. Our plane landed about 35 minutes

7
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:59,480
ago at Austin-Bergstrom International Airport. It is the eighth day of January 2013. I am

8
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:06,600
your host, Alex Jones. And quite frankly, I never thought they'd even put me on CNN

9
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,560
because they know live on air I would basically run over them.

10
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,480
You notice I didn't even wear a sports jacket or a tie or anything like that because I don't

11
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:21,080
respect that show. It's got half a million viewers on average. Today and yesterday, it's

12
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:26,080
the number one Twitter term in the country, Alex Jones. And a lot of that is because of

13
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:31,600
our radio listeners but also DrudgeReport.com pushing the story and really being there to

14
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,880
help show our side of what's happening.

15
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,960
I walked in here, I don't know, ten minutes ago, literally, and I was back in the coffee

16
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:47,400
room trying to get some coffee and wake up here. I'm wearing the same shirt I was wearing

17
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:54,880
last night on Piers Morgan. And that's how much I've been moving here. And he was on

18
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:00,360
CNN playing a clip from earlier. It's wall to wall. Tonight is about the Alex Jones fallout.

19
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:06,400
Of course, they don't wanna hear from me. And they're attacking the First Amendment.

20
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:12,320
In fact, I mean, I heard it bigger than Dallas. McBreen says it's been on all day long where

21
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:20,920
they're saying this man has too big a platform. So see, they're going from saying I don't

22
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,760
exist to saying we have too big a platform because imagine, let me explain something.

23
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:30,880
I've been at CNN 10 years ago in New York. I was at CNN about six years ago in New York.

24
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:37,880
I was at CNN two years ago in New York, the same place, same studios. That place looks

25
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:47,160
like a bombed out World War I. No, scratch that. It looks like Hitler's bunker. And I

26
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:52,120
thought maybe they just put me in a, it was in a studio green room with Fareed Zarkaria's

27
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,120
picture on the wall.

28
00:02:53,120 --> 00:03:00,640
And I thought, well, maybe this is just so torn up carpet feces all over the toilet and

29
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,440
the floor of the bathroom. I thought, well, maybe this is just this green room. So I went

30
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:08,720
into the green room that had the Kennedys in it right before they arrived, some Kennedys

31
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,880
pitching a book, and it was rotting.

32
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:17,240
And let me tell you something, folks, New York City is a giant tomb. When this country

33
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:23,840
goes into full depression, you do not wanna be in there. I mean, I was at a restaurant,

34
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,280
not even that fancy, last night getting some dinner after we got off the plane, got up

35
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,720
at 5 AM yesterday. I'm not bragging, hey, I haven't slept. The reason I look like hell

36
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:36,000
is, folks, I'm a race car that doesn't do pit stops. I mean, I am just pushing it as

37
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,840
hard as I can.

38
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:45,960
And I mean, I ordered not even something very expensive off the menu. And there were people

39
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:49,960
watching when we were eating, watching what others were eating. Everyone was talking about

40
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:54,840
money around me. And this is in Midtown Manhattan, one of the wealthier areas. This country's

41
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,620
just in deep trouble.

42
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:02,360
And Mayor Bloomberg's gonna bankrupt all those people to put them in coffins size for the

43
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:11,240
coffin city. Once a great American city, the Big Apple is now a rose-colored, apple-colored

44
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:16,140
coffin. And they have these little 250 square foot rooms where they're gonna charge you

45
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,800
so much tax, you and your whole family are gonna live in that.

46
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:24,400
Well, he lives in a giant mansion, a penthouse just festooned with armaments and guards with

47
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,760
weapons everywhere. And he takes off off the roof in his fleet of helicopters. And he's

48
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:33,420
even bought a tilt wing aircraft, they have a smaller Osprey. And I'm not against someone

49
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:38,560
having money, he just got it all from inside deals on the stock market.

50
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:46,760
And it's like really, there's detective goons following us around and bugging their eyes

51
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:51,200
out at us and then coming up and saying, I mean, it was just unbelievable. And now Piers

52
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:57,900
Morgan's talking about trying to get rid of my First Amendment rights. They want the guns,

53
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:58,900
they want us disarmed.

54
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:04,400

85
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:22,280
Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.

86
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:50,200
And what's happening in this country is countless globalists are brought in not just Piers Morgan but synthetic citizens like Fareed Zarkaria, the Bilderberg globalist traitor. And they're in here to basically, when I say traitor, he's in there with all these foreign globalists and our politicians, part of the program to overthrow our republic and bring in a global corporate dictatorship and restrict our Second Amendment.

87
00:08:50,200 --> 00:09:00,040
All of these guys get up there on television and you've got the official communist Chinese,

88
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:07,640
People's Daily and their news saying Obama take the guns, wage the war now. You've got

89
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:13,320
just all sorts of globalists pushing this just to get us used to foreigners and globalists

90
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:19,360
and foreign corporations and foreign banks telling us what to do like we're some occupied

91
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:25,120
third world country going under neo-colonial gunboat diplomacy.

92
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:31,340
But it's not a foreign nation colonializing us, it's the global mega banks. Now bear with

93
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:37,320
me today, ladies and gentlemen, because I've had about two hours sleep and again left yesterday

94
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:45,040
at got up at 5 AM to make the trek to the TSA situation. And there's that whole story

95
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:49,840
and that whole report that we need to print off and get ready with those photos.

96
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,600
We actually have the raw video but didn't have time to upload so we had to get on a

97
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,720
plane, we'll do that soon. It was just me and Rob Dew that went to New York to be on

98
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,440
Piers Morgan. And most people had their shoes off, they were just waving everybody through,

99
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:07,720
the scanners were off. And I said, hey, I don't wanna wear my, I don't wanna take my

100
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,720
shoes off.

101
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,160
The woman said, come on, Mr. Jones, and she had already shown on my boarding pass at the

102
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:17,760
first checkpoint. The TSA's even put out a report on the few times I've ever seen them

103
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:23,360
tell the truth and basically confirm what I had said in the report that got written

104
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:29,840
by Paul Watson and then posted at drugsreport.com and went viral from there.

105
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:36,000
And then we got to New York and immediately upon getting to our hotel, there were plain

106
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:45,040
clothes detectives outside and then inside and it's just a classic undercover type cops.

107
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,240
Obviously very corrupt generally if they're working under Bloomberg in a mafia-run city

108
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:54,080
like that, where they're just like guys out of a movie, chewing gum, staring at you like

109
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,760
it's gonna intimidate you.

110
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,680
I mean, it intimidates me and not in the way you think, it makes me have sorrow that our

111
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,480
human species has slumped so far down and that good men and women have cowered to you

112
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:08,120
bullies. So I was pretty wound up once I got on the broadcast, and I give myself about

113
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:15,360
an A, not an A+, not a B+, not a B-. I give myself about an A.

114
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:22,520
And what I wanted to do was point out that we have a foreign globalist here in our midst

115
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:25,520
and that Dianne Feinstein, I had a whole bunch of stuff I wanted to get to and I got to a

116
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:32,880
lot of it, but not all of it. And today I'm gonna read over some of the, I have some notes

117
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,880
that are in my wallet.

118
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:37,880
I'm not sure where I put my wallet, I may have dumped it out there with my phones, but

119
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:43,200
I had some notes that I wanted, thank you. I had some notes I wanted to go over here

120
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,800
on air that some of the points I did get to, some of the points I didn't get to. We'll

121
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:56,120
have Rob do pop in sometime during the next hour to talk about the police following us

122
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,120
around.

123
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:04,000
I mean, this is why we're walking around New York, cuz I wanted to walk around to wake

124
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,640
up cuz I've been up since 5 AM, this is about 7 o'clock at night. And we walk around here,

125
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:13,600
we walk around there, and there were the guys following us around like nerds in a secret

126
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,120
agent movie, talking into their sleeves and talking into their windbreakers.

127
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,600
And sometimes you'd walk up on one and they turn and then walk into the wall like they

128
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:27,200
were a robot or something. I mean, I've seen Secret Service out of events and they act

129
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:33,320
just like children and all get into the secret agentness and imagine that they're 007. 007

130
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:39,440
doesn't exist, the real 007s are with the children grabbed out of backyards this week,

131
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,400
flying them off to the Saudi princes.

132
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:48,040
Flying them off to Saudi Arabia, we know they have one of the biggest white slavery operations

133
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:52,120
in the world. They got thousands of those princes, they're the biggest. I think most

134
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:56,680
rich people just want caviar in a big house, but not the globalist. And so they see us

135
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:05,320
as food. And see, I don't see myself as food. And being up there around all the fake CNN

136
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,320
people and I said, let me guess how this is gonna go.

137
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,240
You're gonna have victims' families up against me. I said this last Friday, talking to them,

138
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:17,080
no, no. And I said, I don't mind that. They go, no, no, no. All they did was lie, which

139
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:21,240
was good cuz I could tell when they were lying. So I knew exactly what they do and I told

140
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:25,600
Rob, flying up there yesterday morning, I said, they're gonna bring up little factoids

141
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,720
and try to make a hinge on that.

142
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:34,280
What type of gun did this mass murder? What type of gun did that mass murder? And I predicted

143
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:40,840
it wasn't hard. It's M4 AR-15 variant. But peers, I have the FBI statistics of the overall

144
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:47,760
20 plus percent and growing crime rate drop as gun ownership has accelerated. And here

145
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:52,480
it is, statistics prove more guns, less crime, inconvenient facts that gun control lobby

146
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,480
cannot answer.

147
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:59,480
And this is from 2007 to 2011. It goes back to the 50s. This is off local police numbers

148
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:08,820
and federal combined. You can see here about a 10% drop in the last, most of this drop

149
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:12,680
has happened just the last five, six years. But before that, it was also dropping. It's

150
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,680
not as fast.

151
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:20,680
And I tried to give him this. I tried to give him that information. He didn't wanna have

152
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:25,360
a real debate and I could read his cue cards when we went to the first break. And it was

153
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:32,440
all, what is the number of people shot at Aurora? What is the number of people shot

154
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,480
at Sandy Hook?

155
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:39,600
And it was all just gonna be Perry Mason like, what color is the tile in the entryway of

156
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:45,520
the south entrance of Buckingham Palace? And he didn't wanna have a real debate. He's like,

157
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:51,680
we're here having a reasonable debate right now. So I knew, hammer down, get that intel

158
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,680
out.

159
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,880
I also told the crew, I said, they're gonna bring up the fact that I pointed out government

160
00:14:55,880 --> 00:15:06,360
sponsored terrorism. Sure enough, they did that. And the real show was what went on inside

161
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:16,280
that big studio. It's like a gymnasium with black walls. I've never been in that particular

162
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,840
old Larry King studio, but I was in the one right next to it with Joy Behar and a few

163
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,840
other shows.

164
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:24,920
The point is, is that I'm in there and they came in and were like, we need to cut this

165
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,680
now. I can hear them all talking behind the cameras and all of a sudden there were all

166
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:33,000
these managers and security people just from the first interview, the first segment, three

167
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:40,480
or four minutes. And Pierce is like, nope, nope, we can't. And he didn't communicate

168
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,480
anything else.

169
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:45,880
It was just, nope, we gotta go ahead. Obviously, cuz I had predicted they would check it out.

170
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:50,520
Three segments, they did two, he panicked. I was so looking forward to Alan Dershowitz,

171
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:55,900
the so-called constitutional lawyer that said on the show after I left that I shouldn't

172
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,280
be able to own guns and I'm dangerous.

173
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:03,680
No, the government that's got the biggest prison population in the world and ships guns

174
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:08,660
to Mexico and runs drugs into the country and has been involved injecting black people

175
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:11,960
with syphilis. And I just mentioned that cuz everybody knows about Tuskegee. There's thousands

176
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:16,640
of other declassified murders of US troops, black, white, Hispanic, doesn't matter, town

177
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,640
sprayed with nerve gas.

178
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:24,640
That's who we need to watch having the guns as George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin

179
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:30,080
Franklin, Thomas Paine, all of them told us over and over again in history as shown. And

180
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:33,840
I'm walking out and they're like, leave now, the security's like now. I'm like, well, I'm

181
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,760
gonna get our bag out of the green room.

182
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:41,320
These guys just really wanted to be tough guys, cuz here they are in this rotting. Cuz

183
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:46,200
I've been to CNN, I'm trying to think, that studio three times and the one next door once,

184
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:52,000
so four times total. Folks, I've been in those exact rooms. It literally looked like a gas

185
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,560
station bathroom in the worst part of town.

186
00:16:55,560 --> 00:17:03,360
It was rotting and those people were in hell. It's a skeleton of what it was. It's a globalist

187
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:08,040
operation and they're nothing. That's why they're saying tonight's show, Alex Jones,

188
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:12,120
cuz they're now reporting. I was just searching it when I was driving, dude's like, better

189
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:15,040
stop that, you're driving.

190
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:19,440
Record ratings, record Twitter, everything. They're like, tonight it'll all be Alex Jones,

191
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:25,840
but Alex Jones won't be there. And how he's a victim. I told him, he said, so you want

192
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:29,480
me deported right before I went live? And I said, no, I did that to get attention to

193
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,680
the fact that you're trying to take our First Amendment, obviously Obama.

194
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:38,760
By the way, the White House responded at the end of the show, saying they'll respond officially,

195
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:42,320
which they never do to petitions they don't like. But they were forced to on this one,

196
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:47,720
100 something thousand signatures. But that obviously free expression is our most important

197
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:54,560
value. The guy is involved in operations against this country and obviously I know he isn't

198
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,640
gonna be deported.

199
00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:01,600
I want to point out that we can culturally deport him. He's already been culturally deported

200
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,680
from England. Every newspaper in England, Watson tells me, including the physical ones

201
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:12,480
that he's seen, have this on the cover or close to the cover. And it's all how I've

202
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,840
attacked the British people. No, the British people have been taken over by globalist and

203
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:20,300
used to fund their worldwide empire while sucking you dry, the host.

204
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:25,120
And now they sucked England dry by the end of World War I, now they've moved on to us,

205
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,960
okay? And that's when the British Empire moved over here. He wrote three different books

206
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,000
on it, Winston Churchill, the history of the English speaking peoples. I've only read one

207
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,440
of them, I read the latter one cuz I wanted to know that history.

208
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:41,440
And he calls us to the American cousins and this whole cutesy relationship. To say that

209
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:47,560
I'm anti-British or anti-Welsh or anti-Scottish or any of that is just asinine, ladies and

210
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:55,480
gentlemen. I'm Welsh, English, Scottish, Irish, the whole nine yards. And it's all Gaelic

211
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:59,280
to begin with, it's all Celtic.

212
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:04,560
But that's what they're trying now in the newspapers over there. I want England to get

213
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:11,320
their guns back. They armed the British population, government armed during World War II in case

214
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,560
they got invaded. They had weapons before that, they had a low crime rate because they

215
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:21,240
were gentlemanly. Now they have a crime rate triple what it was 15 years ago when they

216
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,240
took the guns.

217
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,240
And I've got all the statistics and I tried to get them to Piers Morgan, he knows all

218
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:31,040
that. Kept trying to explain, they kill you with knives and hatchets and beating people's

219
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:37,520
brains in and more people per capita in your country of what, 68, 70 million people. I

220
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,720
guess the whole UK is more than that. And it just didn't matter. So now they're making

221
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:45,680
it about the First Amendment and the whole enemy is going to throw themselves against

222
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,680
us now.

223
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:52,560
So you need to pray for us, support us and understand the trolls at the COINTELPRO cognitive

224
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:56,720
infiltration, Cass Sunstein School are going to be working overdrive to try to attack the

225
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,520
First Amendment and they may be coming after us.

226
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:05,380
Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive from natural disasters

227
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:09,960
like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought, to the family hardships brought on

228
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:14,920
by a disastrous economy? Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything. At e Foods

229
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:19,160
Direct we hear from customers every day that are fortunate enough to weather a life storm

230
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:23,700

231
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:29,360
wrote, almost all the grocery stores are closed, but I managed to get my e Foods just in time

232
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:34,160
to be able to help my sister and niece. It is better to be prepared 10 years too early

237
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:05,040
It's time for a home security quiz. Answer this. What effective home security device

238
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:09,360
is smaller than a coffee cup fakes out burglars into thinking someone is home at your house

239
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:14,260
while you're away, plugs into any wall outlet, is recommended by many police departments

240
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:21,320
and sells for less than $35? Yes, it's fake TV. This year about one in every 50 U.S. homes

241
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:26,080
will have a break-in with burglars usually picking the easy target, a dark house that

242
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:31,120
looks like no one is home. Fake TV is a small electronic security device that makes it look

243
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:36,520
like someone is home watching TV by simulating the light from a real TV. It's like a lamp

244
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:42,120
on a timer, but far more convincing. And for only $34.95, fake TV could be the difference

245
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:47,700
between coming home to a secure house or one that's been ransacked. Go to faketv.com or

call 1-877-5FAKETV. That's 877-532-5388 or go to faketv.com. Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.

You play with my world.

Like it's your little toy.

276
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,120
I just want you to know.

277
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:57,480
You put a gun in my hand.

278
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:01,840
And you hide from the eyes.

279
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:07,160
And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets fly.

280
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,560
That's it.

281
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,360
Like a genius of old.

282
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,560
You see, they're warmongering, killing

283
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:17,480
worldwide, putting 20% roughly of the population, even higher

284
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,720
children, on deadly anti-psychotics,

285
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:22,640
not just serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

286
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:27,480
And serotonin, SSRIs and SRIs, whose inserts

287
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:31,080
say make you commit mass murder, death, mayhem,

288
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,360
psychotic outbreak, suicide.

289
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,920
And then I'm going, Piers Morgan,

290
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:37,160
we now lead the world in suicides.

291
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,600
Our troops are killing themselves.

292
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,640
That was a point I wanted to make.

293
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,680
I had so many points I wanted to make.

294
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,680
But they don't take the troops.

295
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,400
You never hear about the troops dying in suicide

296
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,800
by the thousands and thousands every year,

297
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,800
way over all the other combat deaths.

298
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,920
You never hear about.

299
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:56,560
They come into press and they go, here is Paxil.

300
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,040
All these CNN sponsors.

301
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:02,040
And let me tell you, folks, one of the main producers

302
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:05,560
was crying and then screaming at me.

303
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,440
Other women were hyperventilating.

304
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,640
Men were bowing up.

305
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,640
And at the end of it, going out, I'm like, hey,

306
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,240
I'm an American.

307
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,640
Stop acting tough.

308
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,080
And I told the security guys, they're like,

309
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,160
come on with us downstairs.

310
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:23,080
And I said, I want to go out in the shopping mall exit.

311
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,200
I don't want to go out the back door Bloomberg's people.

312
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,400
And that guy looked at me, no, he's like, ha ha.

313
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,360
That's where you're going.

314
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,200
You're going out there with them.

315
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,920
I go, I don't want a confrontation.

316
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,360
And we caught one of the guys on tape.

317
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,520
I said, do get your camera going.

318
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,440
They're like, you can't film in here.

319
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,400
I go, we got to protect ourselves.

320
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,440
You're coming out and there's one over here and one over here.

321
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,320
And they literally turn, start talking into their little end

322
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,000
pieces, into their sleeves.

323
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,720
And then the guy turns and then walks into a wall

324
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,400
and just starts walking up against a wall

325
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,440
and dudes like, look at that.

326
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,760
And then there's other ones, like in a gangster movie,

327
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,960
going, hey, that's him.

328
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,440
And I'm like, cab, and the cab stops and we jump in.

329
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,680
We didn't go back to other hotel.

330
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,040
We were getting cased when we got there.

331
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,840
They had guys in, not the Bellman,

332
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:06,080
they had guys in suits that were only had eyes for us.

333
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,160
And I said, let's get our stuff.

334
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:12,240
We went to New Jersey, got on our flight back there in Newark.

335
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,000
And I mean, folks, and you know I don't just get up here.

336
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,080
I go to Bilderberg.

337
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,760
I get followed by guys in black sedans.

338
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,040
I've been arrested.

339
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,920
Jim Tucker plays it down when he got shot at.

340
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:25,200
That was in mainstream European papers when he was in Portugal.

341
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,960
Stuck into Bohemian Grove, got questioned

342
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,360
by the Secret Service.

343
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,680
I've been physically attacked.

344
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,180
I mean, I don't build this stuff up.

345
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:33,120
Let me tell you, my dad calls up and he goes,

346
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,800
you need to get out of there.

347
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:38,960
And I was like, Dad, we're already packing.

348
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,920
And my whole family, before I even left,

349
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,080
said we have a bad feeling.

350
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,880
And I just want to thank you all for your prayers.

351
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:50,360
Because these may have actually been mafia they sent over

352
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,000
there.

353
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,480
But I mean, the police detectives in New York

354
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,040
pretty much look like mafia characters

355
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,400
in a movie anyways.

356
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,840
And people ask, well, how would they take you out?

357
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:02,240
Well, you know, we get to our hotel.

358
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,840
They have the streets blocked off, only to our hotel.

359
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,760
They weren't blocked off the day we got there.

360
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:09,200
There were people casing it.

361
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,520
I mean, it was like a movie.

362
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:16,080
And just amazing.

363
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:16,920
Just amazing.

364
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,960
And again, you live this life.

365
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,080
When you really live in the trenches,

366
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,880
average folks that are quiet and reserved,

367
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,400
but also kind of intimidated and meek,

368
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,480
have no idea what's really going on in the world.

369
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,080
I mean, a lot of you may think you do.

370
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,080
But until you really challenge these people,

371
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:38,480
until the NSA or whoever it was calls up your wife

372
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,160
and tells her what she was just talking about on the phone,

373
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,160
and it threatens her.

374
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,840
And until that happens to you, and I've

375
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,440
been in a restaurant with the crew before.

376
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,200
And I'm sitting there talking to my wife.

377
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,400
And then she calls back crying, and it's happened.

378
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,840
I mean, until somebody calls up and says,

379
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:54,880
I'm watching your little dog in your backyard right now.

380
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,360
Until that happens to you, you don't know how real this is.

381
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:01,000
And I'm not intimidated by these people.

382
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,760
I mean, I know they're in the wrong.

383
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:06,160
And I am not going to disgrace my forebears.

384
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,840
Now, did I do a perfect job?

385
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,160
No, I give myself about a 90.

386
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:15,280
Give myself about a 90.

387
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,680
But there's not a lot of armchair quarterbacking

388
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,360
out there.

389
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,400
After you go through the TSA and go through what

390
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,640
I will call Bloomberg's goons, he runs that city.

391
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,480
He's the boss.

392
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,480
He's the Duke of New York.

393
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,800
And we did escape from New York by the blessings of God.

394
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,040
When we come back, I'll run through all the news,

395
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,480
ladies and gentlemen.

396
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,520
But I just can't help it.

397
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,640
When I see bullies, you should have seen how arrogant

398
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,120
he was behind the scenes.

399
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:43,680
When I see people that affected behavior and everybody

400
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:46,280
groveling to them, it just makes my blood boil.

401
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:49,760
Meanwhile, all of CNN is a rotting fake facade.

402
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,160
We're on the march.

403
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,600
The empire's on the run.

404
00:29:53,600 --> 00:30:00,160
Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

405
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:03,320
Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.

406
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:06,800
The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system

407
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,320
runs from bad to worse.

408
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,320
The globalist model is to shut down societies

409
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:13,920
and starve patriots out until they

410
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,680
acquiesce to the global takeover.

411
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:18,040

416

00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:37,880
which is key.

471
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,720
Save money by not buying bottled water

472
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,960
and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.

473
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,680
ProPure is the best gravity fed filter out there.

474
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,240
It's what my family uses.

475
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,600
Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure

476
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,320
but if you add the promo code water at checkout

477

478
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,800
You can also call to order 888-253-3139.

479
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:05,160
Waging war on corruption.

480
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:08,040
It's Alex Jones coming to you live

481
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,720
from the front lines of the info war.

482
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:15,720
I'm only human and flesh and blood needs flesh and blood.

483
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,600
I need you.

484
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:22,600
I hope you need me because together we fight real tyrants.

485
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,440
You know, when they had all these undercover cops

486
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,200
jumping out of alleyways and going,

487
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,880
hey, big fan, big fan.

488
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,960
And some people were lizards, but these were cops.

489
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:32,840
They knew where we were.

490
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,480
They were obviously tracking us via cell phone.

491
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,840
The New York PD is tied into the NSA tracking systems.

492
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:41,000
Just like your wife can track you with your cell phone

493
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,560
if she knows the number, they were doing it.

494
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,760
And it was all, you know,

495
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,640
just pure intimidation out of a movie.

496
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,360
And one time one of them was talking to us

497
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:57,960
and his jacket flapped up and there was his gun.

498
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,240
And they wanted me to know,

499
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:03,400
see the mafia doesn't like you having guns.

500
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:08,400
They want the guns and then you disarmed.

501
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,640
I mean, it's a very simple equation.

502
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,760
And that's what made me mad about them.

503
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,640
That they would have those shark detectives

504
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:19,520
up and down the street in the, I don't know,

505
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,880
10 blocks or so we walked.

506
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:25,040
That they would have people in the hotel,

507
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,480
outside the hotel,

508
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:31,080
that when these guys would shake your hand, you know,

509
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,720
they would go, I really like you.

510
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:34,560
You know what I mean?

511
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,880
I really like you.

512
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:39,120
Just out of the movie, just absolutely out of a movie.

513
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,000
In fact, I went to see the new sniper movie

514
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,440
that has stage mass shootings in it.

515
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,400
No wonder they didn't want it to come out

516
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:51,400
with Tom Cruise, Reacher, and yeah, Jack Reacher.

517
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,400
It's a pretty good movie, actually.

518
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,800
I'm not usually a Tom Cruise fan.

519
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,400
I like some of his earlier stuff.

520
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:02,400
And, you know, in the movie,

521
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,680
there's the woman that's the witness.

522
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,520
They want to get rid of him.

523
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,800
And the guys want him to say, hi, I want to be friends.

524
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,720
Come with us, come with us.

525
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,720
She's like, no, I don't feel like it.

526
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,560
And he goes, do it now.

527
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,920
And the guy's like, bam, knocks her out,

528
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,680
you know, and smothers her.

529
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:15,800
And it's like, just like that.

530
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,280
And you're like, come on, man.

531
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,200
And the big deal is I'm sitting there thinking,

532
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:23,440
okay, if they try something, this is what I'm going to do.

533
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:27,560
And I'm sitting there having to deal

534
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:30,800
with detective after detective, unless they were,

535
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,480
I mean, the two are interchangeable.

536
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,160
This country's just in so much trouble,

537
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,000
ladies and gentlemen.

538
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,440
I mean, they're just used to everybody

539
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,920
being in fear of them, and I'm sorry.

540
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,560
I mean, I'm from Texas, folks,

541
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,880
and the mafia never did too good down here

542
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,160
because people would rather die than be your slaves.

543
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,760
I mean, that's just who I am.

544
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,840
And so you want a war, you got one, okay?

545
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,960
And like I said, you strike me down,

546
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,920
you'll only make our movement that much more powerful.

547
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,160
The consensus is in, I'd say about 95% of people

548
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,920
think that I just told it like it was, slammed them hard,

549
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,440
got in their face, and delivered a message

550
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,640
that we're not going to have our guns taken.

551
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,280
And again, I have been overworked.

552
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,800
I worked till late at night the night before.

553
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,840
Sunday, I flew out at 5 a.m.

554
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:22,920
And I was up all day doing stuff,

555
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,560
doing interviews and things over the phone,

556
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,520
writing stories with Watson on the phone.

557
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:31,120
Go there, go through all their people, deal with it.

558
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,400
But I did the best job I could,

559
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,280
and I'm proud of the job I did overall.

560
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:41,440
And you see the deterioration of my body

561
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,640
in the fight against liberty,

562
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:48,640
that is a symbol of the vigorousness of my soul,

563
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:53,640
that my soul demands, even when I dream,

564
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:56,520
I think about the New World Order and how to defeat them.

565
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:01,680
And so my full being is being turned over

566
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,960
to resistance to the New World Order,

567
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,280
because we're entering a key time here.

568
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,880
And we're at a crossroads deciding our future.

569
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,720
I mean, I'm reading these articles and the videos.

570
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:18,920
I mean, Piers Morgan, when I got here at 10.50

571
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:23,240
and was back there getting coffee.

572
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,000
Look at the jokes, money melded us this coffee cup,

573
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,760
it's the Central Intelligence Agency.

574
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:30,440
You're watching on prisonplanet.tv.

575
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,760
And thanks to whoever melded, I read the card,

576
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,640
I forget the name.

577
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:41,000
And there's Piers Morgan,

578
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
a clip of him this morning on another show,

579
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:48,000
going, I was scared, this guy is dangerous.

580
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,320
And he said a bunch of other stuff.

581
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,400
What was the full quote?

582
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,160
Because you guys saw it too and wrote it down.

583
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,000
I mean, I can't even keep track of this.

584
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,680
And it was electrifying.

585
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,520
It was electrifying.

586
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:01,320
I mean, what, a hillbilly that won't be your slave

587
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,800
and knows history?

588
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,000
Somebody that won't bend over to you

589
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,480
because you got a snot-nosed accent

590
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,960
and look like you're anorexic in person.

591
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,200
You're like a mannequin, a vampire.

592
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,960
Only thing that scares me is ever being like you.

593
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,840
Duty is like a mountain, death is like a feather.

594
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,280
And it's not that I'm up here bragging

595
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,000
I'm this great person of duty.

596
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,720
It has taken me over.

597
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,240
It is rapture.

598
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:35,240
It is relief to just totally turn yourself over

599
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,600
to resistance to evil.

600
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,840
When I think about the innocents

601
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:41,520
that are being abused worldwide by these vampires,

602
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:45,440
my very being, when I was forged in my mother's womb

603
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,960
by God, just as you were,

604
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,640
my destiny, if I take it in my hands,

605
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:54,080
is to defend the innocent, just as I once was.

606
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,920
That is your destiny if you'll take it up

607
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,480
and you will be fulfilled.

608
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,120
Your life will have value.

609
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:06,120
Because the moment you choose life,

610
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:15,280
and so I am bona fide, I'm real, and that's all I can do.

611
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:19,640
I never wanted to be your toad-like champion of liberty,

612
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:22,000
but I am the best there is.

613
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,680
And I am here to call forth others to resist tyranny,

614
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,280
and I know you're out there.

615
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,480
Let's go to drugsreport.com if you're watching on TV.

616
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,960
Radio listeners, go there.

617
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,200
I mean, it says it all.

618
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,080
It's on, Alex Jones versus Piers Morgan.

619
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:37,320
1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms.

620
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,520
You're a hatchet man of the New World Order.

621
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:43,000
Jones, I made CNN producer cry.

622
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,720
Piers, concern that someone like him

623
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:46,960
has that level of influence.

624
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,240
Yeah, and now they've got Dershowitz on other shows,

625
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,920
not just last night, saying,

626
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:55,480
I shouldn't be able to own guns, and I'm obviously ill,

627
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,920
because he's a little hunchback old man,

628
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:58,920
nothing against hunchbacks,

629
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,800
but with him, it fits the arc dive,

630
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,200
who said we should have let police or anybody

631
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,640
torture whoever they want.

632
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:08,920
I mean, get in a teleporter and go back to Stalinist Russia

633
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,320
or Nazi Germany, Dershowitz.

634
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,640
You're a joke, because you sit there with an effect.

635
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,640
I mean, let me tell you something, Dershowitz.

636
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,120
When I said, hey, Dershowitz,

637
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,160
and he looked at who I was,

638
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,920
they all panicked and ran in fear.

639
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,800
And he said on the show, I'm scary.

640
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,280
What, I'm scary?

641
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,640
That I see a dangerous person that wants endless war

642
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,440
and secret arrest and torture and NDAA on the books

643
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,040
to disappear me and my family,

644
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,040
and CIA torture flights in the sky,

645
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,760
and the government shipping guns to Mexico

646
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,040
and narcotics into the country,

647
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:38,160
and I'm being stalked by mafia,

648
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,880
and NSA calling my house, death-threading my family,

649
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,800
or whoever, it could be private corporations for all I know,

650
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,320
who are able to listen to our phone.

651
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,400
The stuff I put up with, and you people,

652
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:50,440
some of you out there understand just how real this is.

653
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,040
What you're seeing here, folks,

654
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,280
I'm somebody who understands history,

655
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:58,480
saw it a long way off, and put my full will against it.

656
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,360
And it doesn't mean I'm that strong.

657
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,800
My will is strong, my body, my intellect is weak,

658
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,880
but I have put my full will against these people.

659
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,600
They're spiritual rules to the universe,

660
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:10,720
and I have committed at a spiritual level.

661
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,240
And that's where your real power is.

662
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,800
I don't, whatever, you may not believe in God or not,

663
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,640
but let me tell you something.

664
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,360
There are more things in this world

665
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,920
than just what's in your books.

666
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,240
Which Shakespeare play is that?

667
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,680
I want the full quote if you guys can pull it up.

668
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:25,560
And they kind of rip it off in O'Brien's,

669
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:29,400
which is an excellent film and group of books,

670
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,560
the adaptation, Matcher and Commander.

671
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,400
Because as soon as the guy commits suicide,

672
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,840
he thinks that Jonas, the wind picks up

673
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,400
and they're not be calmed after, you know,

674
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,560
six weeks or whatever, about to all die.

675
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,560
And he looks over to Matcher and he says,

676
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,800
there's a lot of things in this world

677
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,360
that aren't your books, buddy.

678
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:50,920
And all I can say is, is that we all have to commit here.

679
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:51,920
Okay?

680
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,880
I mean, I look at my fellow Americans

681
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,840
and they have a memory of being great humans,

682
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,680
whether you're black, white, Asian, Hispanic,

683
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,240
I don't care, I see the greatness in your eyes.

684
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,560
I see young men with their young lives

685
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,440
and I see the potential greatness and a feeling

686
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,040
that you should be doing great things

687
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,680
because you should be doing great things.

688
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:13,120
Our ancestors, all of them, went through hell to survive

689
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:15,840
and survival was always victory, just surviving.

690
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:20,840
And you are powerful and I see how scared you are.

691
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:26,640
I see how intimidated you are and it tears at me.

692
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:30,000
And that's why I have to get in the face of the TSA

693
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
when they get in my face and I see abuses.

694
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,600
That's why I have to get in the face of Piers Morgan

695
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,960
because I can't help it.

696
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,760
I don't like scammers.

697
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:43,360
I don't like people that organize themselves and run hoaxes.

698
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,600
Let me give you an example of hoaxes.

699
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,960
It's also at DrudgeReport.com.

700
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:49,480
It's also on Infowars.com and it's also in USA Today.

701
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:52,160
Look how it's formatted on your computer now.

702
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,360
Talk about Pavlovian.

703
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:59,280
And they set up these panic tents every flu season

704
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:02,280
for the flu epidemic like it's a movie.

705
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,600
They do these emergency drills

706
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:05,800
and then they show you these tents and they go,

707
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,440
my gosh, it's a pandemic, 29 states report

708
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:11,560
high flu rate activity, at least 18 children die.

709
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:13,240
And again, oh my gosh, 18 children,

710
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:17,240
don't ever go out, folks, there are 315 million people.

711
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:19,120
Most children, and I've had medical doctors

712
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,760
on and gone over the statistics on this,

713
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:24,400
that end up dying, have been filled

714
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,720
with hundreds of vaccines, already have organ failure.

715
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:30,020
Our amputees have cancer, you name it.

716
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:32,600
And then the cause of death from exhaustion,

717
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:35,580
the old days they would just say exhaustion, malnutrition.

718
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:38,680
Now they say flu, because that's the trendy thing.

719
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:42,320
They tell you 35,000 die a year of flu in the United States.

720
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,800
Real numbers are about 300.

721
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,000
You can go pull this up.

722
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:52,020
And they admit that the flu vaccine takes your immunity

723
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:53,960
and actually makes you get the flu the next year.

724
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:56,920
Major studies, Canadian, US, I mean, it's all there.

725
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:59,760
They say on the insert, they admit they've never guessed

726
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,720
the proper flu.

727
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:08,080
I'm getting a little bit of a reverb.

728
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:10,180
I know Jonas has changed studios.

729
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:13,640
You guys hear that micro reverb?

730
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:14,480
Is there a guest in here?

731
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:17,240
There may be a headset on or something in here.

732
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:19,320
Just drives me crazy, sorry.

733
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:21,640
I'm sitting there, I'm so exhausted, I'm just tired.

734
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:22,680
I just can't have any distractions.

735
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:23,520
Thank you, guys.

736
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,180
And it's the same thing.

737
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:28,600
They just hoax it in all dovetails of the movies.

738
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:31,720
And then they make, some numbers are 40 something billion

739
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:33,680
a year just off flu shots worldwide.

740
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:36,400
Large percentage of that's in the US.

741
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:37,680
Just look at the numbers.

742
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:38,540
In fact, they're actually higher.

743
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:41,080
I went with a low number from about a decade ago.

744
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:46,080
And they admit on record

745
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:48,360
that they've never guessed the year before

746
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:49,320
what the new flu is.

747
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,740
It's just a total hoax.

748
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:53,880
And they might as well just have boogeymen run around

749
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:57,120
in people's windows at night and say, I'm the flu monster.

750
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:58,320
Take shots or I'll get you.

751
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,600
I mean, they treat you like children.

752
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:02,880
And I look at the sheepishness of people.

753
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:07,400
And I see men who think because they're totally withdrawn

754
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:10,960
and say nothing to anyone that that gives them manliness.

755
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,260
And I watch people have these fake conversations

756
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:14,760
with each other out in public.

757
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:16,320
I'm like, don't you really wanna live?

758
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:17,480
Aren't you real?

759
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:19,080
Don't you have any gusto?

760
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:22,100
Is there anything genuine in you?

761
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:28,240
And I just see the soul of humanity driven out of us.

762
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,840
And it is a spell.

763
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:35,640
I mean, it's a mindset, it's programming.

764
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:37,720
You can use a modern term or an ancient term.

765
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:39,520
We have to break the spell.

766
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:45,120
And if you just knew what was waiting for you,

767
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:45,960
it's gone now, guys.

768
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,920
Whoever changed something, it's gone, thank you.

769
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:51,800
If you just knew that when you committed and stepped across

770
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:53,440
and realized you were being lied to

771
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:54,780
that the hoax would fall.

772
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:58,120
I mean, when I was at CNN, however many,

773
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:00,580
decade ago, however long ago it was the first time,

774
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:01,880
it was glistening.

775
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:06,760
When I was in other news agencies, they were glistening.

776
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:09,040
They are rotting carcasses.

777
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,840
They are a facade.

778
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:15,240
Piers Morgan is a facade fired from multiple newspapers

779
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:19,200
for fake stories, implicated in insider trading.

780
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:27,080
His entourage arrested and on trial for phone hacking.

781
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:30,400
By the way, if you really think a reporter knows

782
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,600
how to go phone hack people, I got an Easter bunny

783
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,360
on the moon, I'm ready to sell you.

784
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:36,200
These people are government operatives.

785
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:38,040
If you don't know CNN, I'm saying,

786
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:40,000
hey, I know you guys are CIA.

787
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,240
When I first got there, there were all these knowing looks.

788
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:44,120
They're like proud of it, like they're agents.

789
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:47,000
Oh, yeah, the agents give them stuff to get out

790
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:47,840
to the public.

791
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:49,420
Well, yeah, I mean, national defense.

792
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:51,200
I mean, we use government satellites,

793
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:52,520
at least we did in the past.

794
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:53,800
It's in mainstream news.

795
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:56,320
Look it up, World Net Daily, Washington Post.

796
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:59,720
That's the CIA telling the CIA that the Pentagon,

797
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:02,520
remember Gore Vidal, probably five, six years ago,

798
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:05,040
he died, obviously last year.

799
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,680
Love him or hate him, the guy had a lot of courage

800
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:09,560
when it came to talking about false flag terror.

801
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:13,000
And he was on CNN one time, we've played the clip many,

802
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,880
you might be able to find it on YouTube.

803
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:18,120
About six, seven years ago, I guess, Tom Fly was like 96.

804
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:20,040
He goes, I just want to say this is the first time

805
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:24,240
I've been on CNN in years, where there's not a full star

806
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:29,240
general calling the shots when it's a national security show.

807
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:34,720
You'd find that, I mean, that got reported in the news.

808
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:39,000
I mean, when you're there and you're looking at CIA people

809
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,880
who hate you, and all they've got is like this act,

810
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:45,160
like they're the tough guys, they're the bad guys.

811
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:47,640
No, what you are is a sack of garbage.

812
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:50,240
You work for foreign banks to bring down this country

813
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:55,240
and to make people poor because wealth empowers people.

814
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:02,360
And all I want to say to all of you that serve evil,

815
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:04,800
you really think you're going to get away

816
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:07,440
from the new world order by complying with it?

817
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:08,400
You're crazy.

818
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:11,760
And I'll open the phones up in the next hour

819
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:12,800
and at the bottom of the next hour,

820
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,680
we'll have to pop in with his recollection

821
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:18,520
of all the goons they had out there.

822
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:21,880
And I want to go over all of this news.

823
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:26,000
It's just that if you just tuned in, we have these clips,

824
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,680
but I'm sure you're seeing it in the news yourself.

825
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:30,280
I mean, every time they tell me it's been on all day,

826
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:32,040
I just caught it once and I've seen some of the video clips

827
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:33,240
during the breaks online.

828
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:38,440
When you turn on CNN,

829
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:40,720
they're talking about the evil, dangerous Alex Jones.

830
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:43,920
He's got too much power and I've gone from,

831
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,720
I don't exist, I got too much power.

832
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:49,320
Believe me, folks, I don't want the power.

833
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:51,120
I've been trying to distribute it,

834
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:53,160
just like other people have who are smart.

835
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:59,400
You hear like WorldNetDaily or WorldNetDaily.com

836
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:02,200
or DreadReport.com, you hear these or you see,

837
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:03,040
what are they trying to do?

838
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,400
They're trying to find more people that know what's going on

839
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,360
because folks, this is dangerous.

840
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:15,320
Okay, this is not a fun crown to wear.

841
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:19,120
Okay, because the system is now scared.

842
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:22,040
They've gone from being arrogant to being scared

843
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:22,920
to putting on a good front.

844
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:25,680
Now they realize that they thought

845
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:26,680
they were gonna get our guns

846
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:28,320
and it totally backfired on them,

847
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:31,280
led by this radio show and this radio host

848
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,080
and DreadReport.com.

849
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:36,360
I just gotta keep giving credit where this is happening.

850
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:38,080
Other mainline talk show hosts,

851
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:39,480
libertarian conservative style,

852
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:40,720
they're just either don't get it

853
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,200
or they're subconsciously afraid

854
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:44,960
and won't lay it out like it is, okay?

855
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:47,320
So the globalists just keep inchworming,

856
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:50,000
a salami slicing where they get what they want.

857
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,640
You've gotta admit how bad it is if we have any hope.

858
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:55,560
And there are a lot of you out there

859
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:56,560
that know what's going on,

860
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:58,560
but you look at others like they're your leader.

861
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:00,080
You've gotta start YouTube channels.

862
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,640
You've gotta start websites.

863
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:03,320
You've gotta start radio shows.

864
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:05,160
You've gotta get aggressive.

865
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:07,760
When you see cops standing around with shaved heads,

866
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:11,560
with huge arms, staring at people walking out of stores,

867
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:12,760
you gotta pull your car over and get up and go,

868
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:14,160
hey guys, what's going on?

869
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:15,000
You're like, what do you want?

870
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,400
Well, I'm just a citizen.

871
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:17,240
And you know what?

872
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:18,960
If they attack you, that's the way it is.

873
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,960
Have video, show it.

874
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,360
I mean, we've got to,

875
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:26,320
the system knows it's committed crimes.

876
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:28,000
So it's gone and hired a bunch of people

877
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,600
that just like to dominate,

878
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:31,000
to try to intimidate us.

879
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,480
That's what all the TSA is about, all of it.

880
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:36,320
This is their revolution against us.

881
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:37,800
And most police are not bad.

882
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:40,000
But a lot of them,

883
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,560
especially the ones they put in command are.

884
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:44,080
Just like the guy at Austin Airport,

885
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:45,280
I was being pretty nice.

886
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:46,120
I was like, well, hey,

887
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:47,800
they don't have to wear, take their shoes off.

888
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:49,200
This guy walked over and just hate,

889
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,040
like I'll brutalize you.

890
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:51,960
And was like, you go through there,

891
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:52,960
I'm going to arrest you.

892
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:55,080
Just like, just let me attack you.

893
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:57,280
Man, you must be a pathetic person.

894
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:01,840
Hello, I'm Alex Jones.

895
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:05,160
Myself, my family, the Infowars.com team

896
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:07,960
want to relay to you and your families

897
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:10,320
that we are intensifying our efforts

898
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:14,200
against the globalist on every front. Infowars.com

899
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:16,800
is leading the fight against the technocrats.

900
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:19,560
But we can't do that without your help.

901
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:22,480
By getting the films, bumper stickers and t-shirts

902
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:26,280
at Infowars.com, you will wake up people in your area

903
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:30,800
and support our operation as we move to the next level.

904
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:34,320
We need your help to spread the word like never before.

905
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:37,640
They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle

906
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:40,400
between the forces of freedom and darkness.

907
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:44,320
You are the response to the globalist technocrats

908
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:48,040
and their program of global eugenics dehumanization

909
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:50,320
and ultimate extermination.

910
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:51,720
The war is here.

911
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:53,720
It's an info war.

912
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:58,720
The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.

913
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,440
Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling

914
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:04,920
book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.

915
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:07,760
I want you to know some very important information.

916
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:11,520
In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that carnivora

917
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,800
be sent directly to the White House at a time

918
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:16,880
when only the president could obtain this world-class healer.

919
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:20,200
Now, 27 years later, carnivora capsules are used

920
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:22,440
around the world to keep people healthy.

921
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:24,800
Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones

922
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:28,040
in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring

923
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:31,760
compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only

924
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:33,800
without harming a single normal cell.

925
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:35,960
If you wanna stay healthy, now's your chance

926
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:38,360
to literally wake up your critical immune cells

927
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:41,520
to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.

928
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:45,840
Call 1-866-VenusFly or order from carnivora.com.

929
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:49,440
That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A.com.

930
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:54,440
That's 1-866-836-8735, 1-866-VenusFly

931
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:56,680
or visit carnivora.com.

932
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:57,920
Protect your immune system.

933
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:59,360
It's the only one you've got.

934
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:03,200
Hey there, Frank Bates here.

935
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,000
Have you heard about the weird device

936
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,280
that could wipe out 280 million Americans?

937
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:10,080
This is really scary stuff.

938
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:12,640
Defense experts warn that this odd device

939
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:15,320
poses the greatest threat we've ever known.

940
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:17,080
In fact, just a few weeks ago,

941
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:19,000
former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich

942
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,080
wrote an op-ed piece for the Washington Post

943
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:23,360
warning about this deadly threat.

944
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:26,120
I can't believe that more people aren't talking about this.

945
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:28,320
It may be because the liberals and the government

946
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:29,960
are trying to cover it up.

947
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:32,360
That's why my friend just created a free video

948
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:35,760
at weirddevice.com that exposes this threat

949
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:38,480
and blows the doors off a conspiracy.

950
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:42,120
Go watch the shocking video at weirddevice.com right now

951
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:44,240
to discover exactly what it is,

952
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:46,240
plus discover the number one way

953
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:49,360
you and your family can survive this deadly attack.

954
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:51,480
I'm not sure how long this video will be online,

955
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:54,640
so go to weirddevice.com before it's gone forever.

956
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,920
Again, that's weirddevice.com.

957
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:58,600
Thanks for watching.

958
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:31,920
is undignified and unedifying.

959
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,440
I mean, it's just such an act

960
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,320
where these guys act all gentlemanly

961
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:38,240
while they absolutely run over the top of you.

962
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:39,640
And that's part of what they do.

963
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:42,400
I mean, this guy, the average American

964
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:45,200
who watches CNN hardly can tie their shoelaces

965
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:48,280
or their well-meaning, let's just be honest, women,

966
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:50,680
liberal women who just think, oh, that's Piers.

967
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:51,940
He really cares about the kids.

968
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:54,920
And it's also calculated when you know media.

969
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:56,560
And they lied to me about everything.

970
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:59,600
And it's not that I didn't know that they were gonna lie.

971
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:01,840
It's just that on the front page of CNN,

972
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,080
and their website is actually big,

973
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:04,680
it's bigger than their TV shows,

974
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,720
they are talking about how I'm dangerous

975
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,260
and I don't need to have guns.

976
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:13,360
But that's good because it gets them out in the open.

977
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:15,520
They want our guns, like Dianne Feinstein said.

978
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:16,680
And I'm sick of him like,

979
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:18,120
we just want reasonable restrictions.

980
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:19,760
They make it about a certain type of guns,

981
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:21,340
then they ban those, then they ban the others.

982
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:22,840
I know they're liars.

983
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:26,440
It'd be like a used car salesman

984
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:29,000
that tried to sell me a Pinto

985
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,840
and told me that it was a brand new Aston Martin.

986
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:33,440
I'd say, man, that's a rusted out Pinto

987
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:34,820
that won't even start.

988
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:35,660
And they're like, no, it's not.

989
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:38,700
It's a Rolls Royce, brand new.

990
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:40,280
And they're like, oh, you're crazy.

991
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:41,520
You shouldn't get mad.

992
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:43,760
But see, government makes you buy it.

993
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:45,720
They force a Pinto on you

994
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:47,640
and then tax you for an Aston Martin

995
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:49,880
and tell you

996
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:54,880
that you've got a brand new 600 horsepower Corvette.

997
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:59,240
And what you've got is a

998
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:03,280
vehicle that won't even start.

999
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:05,560
I mean, I'm just done.

1000
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:07,040
I'm done playing games with them.

1001
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:09,160
And we need to shake people out of their trance.

1002
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:11,360
The reason this interview has exploded so big

1003
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:16,360
is that they know the public is in a trance

1004
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:24,360
and they are absolutely freaking out right now

1005
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:26,380
because all over the internet,

1006
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:29,020
people resonated with what I said

1007
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:30,660
because they're sick of the script

1008
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:33,020
of everyone sitting there nicely debating back and forth

1009
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:34,940
with a bunch of controlled talking points.

1010
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:39,940
In fact, I even recorded some of the walls there.

1011
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:41,940
Some of the walls there, I was walking around my iPhone,

1012
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:46,380
but they wanted to pre-script.

1013
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:47,780
In fact, I even have notes.

1014
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:51,240
They wanted to pre-script what we were gonna talk about.

1015
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:53,220
They wanted to know everything I was gonna cover.

1016
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:54,260
And then I'd sit there and I'd say,

1017
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:55,500
oh, well, this is what I plan to cover.

1018
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:56,980
That's what I plan to cover.

1019
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:58,340
I said, and what are you gonna do?

1020
00:56:58,340 --> 00:57:00,180
You're gonna have victims' families on right before me,

1021
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:01,020
aren't you?

1022
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:03,260
Like, oh, no, no, no.

1023
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:04,660
And you say, well, I gave them the idea.

1024
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:06,200
No, no, I know how they work.

1025
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:09,700
Let's not put the cart before the horse here.

1026
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:12,060
And I knew they'd bring up 9-11.

1027
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:14,900
Look, 9-11, our government runs Al-Qaeda

1028
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:16,340
in Libya and Syria.

1029
00:57:16,340 --> 00:57:18,260
I'm not saying there aren't some Muslim extremists

1030
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:19,260
and that there aren't real terrorists.

1031
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:21,220
The point is, most of the time, they're protected,

1032
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:23,620
they're directed, and the NORAD stands down.

1033
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:25,180
The official story is just not true.

1034
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:26,620
And that made it even matter

1035
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:29,740
when I went over all those points.

1036
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:31,500
And there is just so much news here.

1037
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:34,660
I mean, it's just hundreds of newspapers reporting on it.

1038
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:35,820
We've got the clips coming up.

1039
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:38,100
Aaron Dykes is gonna pop in and do.

1040
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:39,520
Then we'll open the phones up.

1041
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:40,980
I haven't even gotten to these clips yet,

1042
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:42,640
so I can actually say what I wanted to say.

1043
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:45,740
We'll play some of what was happening, then I'll elaborate.

1044
00:57:45,740 --> 00:57:48,300
I'm not tired anymore now that I got here on the air.

1045
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:52,900
I'm a little bit dingy because of about two hours sleep.

1046
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:54,340
Again, I flew to New York yesterday,

1047
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:55,240
came back this morning.

1048
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:56,820
I'm here on the radio right now.

1049
00:57:56,820 --> 00:57:57,660
Feel like I've been up all day

1050
00:57:57,660 --> 00:57:59,300
because I have since like 4 a.m.

1051
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:04,900
And side issue, it's just, it's amazing.

1052
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:07,700
But I do wanna hear from Lou Rockwell.

1053
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:08,660
I wanna hear from Ron Paul.

1054
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:10,460
He's on with us tomorrow, right?

1055
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:11,300
Confirmed?

1056
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:13,180
Ron Paul, okay, great.

1057
00:58:13,180 --> 00:58:17,820
And I wanna hear from everybody what they think about this,

1058
00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:19,300
because these guys aren't just attacking

1059
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:20,780
the Second Amendment.

1060
00:58:20,780 --> 00:58:23,780
They've gotten rid of the fourth, the fifth, the 10th,

1061
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:26,140
and now they want our second.

1062
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:27,980
And the people are not going to put up with it.

1063
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:31,940
So a ton of news also on the flu hype, video clips,

1064
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:35,740
and the real statistics, and my adventures with the TSA,

1065
00:58:35,740 --> 00:58:39,380
the Slave Training Agency.

1066
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:44,380
This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.

1067
00:58:52,540 --> 00:58:54,660

1087
00:59:53,140 --> 00:59:55,460
Waging war on corruption.

1088
00:59:55,460 --> 01:00:04,860
Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.

1089
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:09,660
Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.

1090
01:00:09,660 --> 01:00:11,220
You want answers?

1091
01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:12,780
Well, so does he.

1092
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:16,940
He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.

1093
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:22,100
And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.

1094
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:23,460
All right, we're gonna have Aaron Dykes in here

1095
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:25,500
for a couple segments and start playing some clips

1096
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:26,500
in the next segment.

1097
01:00:27,740 --> 01:00:29,780
But here's the main point I meant to make.

1098
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:34,140
And Rob Dues saw this, some of it's on tape

1099
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:35,680
because he was back in the green room

1100
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:37,360
and even before I was off, they're like,

1101
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:39,760
get your stuff, get ready, get out of here.

1102
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:42,840
They were, the producer had tears running down

1103
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:44,480
and was yelling.

1104
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:47,900
Other women were breathing heavy, freaking out.

1105
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:51,580
The woman that did my makeup named Yoko,

1106
01:00:51,580 --> 01:00:54,540
an attractive Japanese lady, she,

1107
01:00:55,540 --> 01:00:56,860
I was like, you know the women in India

1108
01:00:56,860 --> 01:00:58,500
that are being raped and masked, the police won't help.

1109
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:01,300
In fact, a lot of them are involved, it's so corrupt.

1110
01:01:01,300 --> 01:01:02,980
And it's so, talk about overpopulated.

1111
01:01:02,980 --> 01:01:05,020
I mean, I've talked to folks who go to India a lot.

1112
01:01:05,020 --> 01:01:06,780
They're just hellish in the cities.

1113
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:07,840
A lot of nice people over there, though.

1114
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:10,220
But you have really good people or really bad people.

1115
01:01:10,220 --> 01:01:11,660
I guess that's the way it is everywhere.

1116
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:14,020
But to finish the story, well, I'll just get to it later.

1117
01:01:14,020 --> 01:01:16,460
It's just, I'm sitting there, this is like 10 minutes before

1118
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:18,180
and they're putting makeup on me.

1119
01:01:18,180 --> 01:01:20,100
And they're sitting there and I go,

1120
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:23,140
hey, you know, I've got daughters.

1121
01:01:23,140 --> 01:01:24,660
They're learning how to shoot firearms.

1122
01:01:24,660 --> 01:01:27,420
And I think it's good that when they're move away

1123
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:28,980
or whatever, when their husband's gone,

1124
01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:31,140
they have firearms, protect themselves and they grow up.

1125
01:01:31,140 --> 01:01:32,680
And I go, you know, these women are asking for firearms

1126
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:33,520
in India.

1127
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:34,940
And she goes, no, I'd rather the police handle it.

1128
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:36,900
And I go, well, what do you do when you're on a bus?

1129
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:39,740
Because they just had the CIA guy,

1130
01:01:39,740 --> 01:01:44,120
admitted CIA, Anderson Cooper was on right before.

1131
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:48,460
And he was talking about them raping that woman

1132
01:01:48,460 --> 01:01:53,460
to death with a four-foot iron rod, rebar.

1133
01:01:54,700 --> 01:01:57,720
And I was saying, man, those women need to be armed.

1134
01:01:59,020 --> 01:02:02,340
And she said, no, no, only the police can be armed.

1135
01:02:02,340 --> 01:02:05,680
And it's just so domesticated.

1136
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:09,060
I mean, just so, I mean, I think about my grandmothers,

1137
01:02:09,060 --> 01:02:11,540
one of them who's still alive and they weren't, you know,

1138
01:02:11,540 --> 01:02:13,140
misses, they were lady ladies, you know,

1139
01:02:13,140 --> 01:02:15,120
real sweet and everything, cooking pies.

1140
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:17,740
But somebody came around the house,

1141
01:02:17,740 --> 01:02:19,740
gave them their problem and got the rifle and said,

1142
01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:21,280
you ready to die, buddy?

1143
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:23,860
I mean, how did they turn women into this?

1144
01:02:23,860 --> 01:02:26,540
And men are even more weak than women.

1145
01:02:26,540 --> 01:02:29,300
Now, watching all the sitcoms and dramas,

1146
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:31,700
because when I'm in a hotel room,

1147
01:02:31,700 --> 01:02:32,900
I'll watch more TV than I normally do.

1148
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:33,900
And then watching them on the airplane,

1149
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:35,720
they had dramas and sitcoms on.

1150
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:37,620
The men are all bumbling buffoons

1151
01:02:37,620 --> 01:02:39,220
and the women are the bosses.

1152
01:02:39,220 --> 01:02:40,660
Every movie, every show, I mean,

1153
01:02:40,660 --> 01:02:43,700
it's just like this agenda is anti-human.

1154
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:45,560
Aaron, what do you want to talk about when we come back?

1155
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:47,140
We're gonna play some clips, you're pretty wound up.

1156
01:02:47,140 --> 01:02:49,060
It's just amazing to me how controlled

1157
01:02:49,060 --> 01:02:50,580
the whole TV thing is.

1158
01:02:50,580 --> 01:02:53,620
CNN's a great example of a 30-year-plus psyop

1159
01:02:53,620 --> 01:02:56,540
where it's no substance, it's all this style,

1160
01:02:56,540 --> 01:02:59,300
very polite people, well-spoken, of course,

1161
01:02:59,300 --> 01:03:01,860
but they're always somehow missing the issue

1162
01:03:01,860 --> 01:03:05,020
and always painting anybody who tries to say common sense

1163
01:03:05,020 --> 01:03:05,860
as this moron.

1164
01:03:05,860 --> 01:03:07,380
They'll have, you know, Larry-

1165
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:09,460
CNN says there's no Napa superhighways

1166
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:11,080
even though they got billboards up for them.

1167
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:13,340
But they have people like Sheriff Joe Arpaio

1168
01:03:13,340 --> 01:03:14,580
who was also on last night.

1169
01:03:14,580 --> 01:03:16,900
They have Larry Pratt gun owners.

1170
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:19,140
They will come on and be calm, lay out the points.

1171
01:03:19,140 --> 01:03:20,660
They make great arguments too,

1172
01:03:20,660 --> 01:03:22,220
but then they'll put in those lower thirds,

1173
01:03:22,220 --> 01:03:24,300
you know, baby killer type stuff

1174
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:25,660
and really just trying to paint them as-

1175
01:03:25,660 --> 01:03:29,340
They're creating, they're creating this mass guilt

1176
01:03:29,340 --> 01:03:32,620
that we collectively, gun owners, we kill these kids.

1177
01:03:32,620 --> 01:03:35,240
When, I meant to say this, this is why I kept getting mad.

1178
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:38,060
They created the victim disarmament zones in those schools.

1179
01:03:38,060 --> 01:03:40,500
Alex, it was great to see someone go in there

1180
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:42,500
like Jesus did to the corrupt bankers

1181
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:44,180
in the old churches in the days of the Bible

1182
01:03:44,180 --> 01:03:45,940
and turn over the tables and say,

1183
01:03:45,940 --> 01:03:47,940
this is a matrix breaking through moment.

1184
01:03:47,940 --> 01:03:48,780
This whole system-

1185
01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:50,740
Whoa, I never said that in the office.

1186
01:03:50,740 --> 01:03:52,300
I said that to Rob Dew and he said,

1187
01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:53,220
and I wasn't going to do it.

1188
01:03:53,220 --> 01:03:56,340
I said, what if I overturned the table like Christ?

1189
01:03:56,340 --> 01:03:57,660
And it was almost like,

1190
01:03:57,660 --> 01:03:59,420
then they didn't want to even be at the table.

1191
01:03:59,420 --> 01:04:00,580
It was weird.

1192
01:04:00,580 --> 01:04:02,260
They wanted me out there, I guess, to have a lower view.

1193
01:04:02,260 --> 01:04:05,060
It made me look fatter, you know, over on the edge.

1194
01:04:05,060 --> 01:04:06,060
I've never seen that on that show.

1195
01:04:06,060 --> 01:04:07,340
I haven't watched it a lot, but you know,

1196
01:04:07,340 --> 01:04:10,220
the point is why I even had that, that is incredible.

1197
01:04:10,220 --> 01:04:12,120
But that's what, that's what I was channeling.

1198
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:13,460
And I was trying to do that when I was there,

1199
01:04:13,460 --> 01:04:15,340
but I held back and was too polite.

1200
01:04:15,340 --> 01:04:16,340
I shouldn't have really gone after him.

1201
01:04:16,340 --> 01:04:18,900
You see, Piers has a gentlemanly overlay,

1202
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:20,940
but he's been spouting at the mouth

1203
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:22,420
for weeks since this tragedy,

1204
01:04:22,420 --> 01:04:25,540
since the Bob Costas football murder suicide thing.

1205
01:04:25,540 --> 01:04:28,420
And before that, demanding to turn in the guns,

1206
01:04:28,420 --> 01:04:30,460
he plays the victim this morning.

1207
01:04:30,460 --> 01:04:32,500
He plays up the victims of this tragedy.

1208
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:33,860
You've got a lot to say, stay there.

1209
01:04:33,860 --> 01:04:34,700
I'm going to give you the floor

1210
01:04:34,700 --> 01:04:35,540
when we come back where Blake lives.

1211
01:04:35,540 --> 01:04:36,860
I need to, you're absolutely right.

1212
01:04:36,860 --> 01:04:38,340
Come back, break that down.

1213
01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:39,860
All I know is they were hyperventilating,

1214
01:04:39,860 --> 01:04:42,260
they were panicked, they were freaked, they were scared.

1215
01:04:42,260 --> 01:04:43,620
They had the Kennedys on who were like,

1216
01:04:43,620 --> 01:04:45,460
that man was scary, he shouldn't have guns.

1217
01:04:45,460 --> 01:04:47,860
I looked at them, these people, they,

1218
01:04:47,860 --> 01:04:50,260
these globalists know how to manipulate people,

1219
01:04:50,260 --> 01:04:52,420
but there's so many generations into it.

1220
01:04:52,420 --> 01:04:55,300
They're dinosaurs, they're scared little Skeksis

1221
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:56,700
in their dark tower.

1222
01:04:56,700 --> 01:04:58,620
These people are a joke.

1223
01:05:00,700 --> 01:05:04,900
You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.

1224
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:06,140
Tyranny is here.

1225
01:05:06,140 --> 01:05:10,100
The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.

1226
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:12,500
It really says that the state is God.

1227
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:15,060
The United States is now recognized globally

1228
01:05:15,060 --> 01:05:18,180
as one of the most impressive police states on earth.

1229
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:20,620
This film conclusively proves the existence

1230
01:05:20,620 --> 01:05:22,700
of a secret network of FEMA camps

1231
01:05:22,700 --> 01:05:24,860
now being expanded nationwide.

1232
01:05:24,860 --> 01:05:27,300
This documentary exposes how the continuity

1233
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:28,980
of government program has established

1234
01:05:28,980 --> 01:05:30,860
an all powerful shadow state.

1235
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:33,260
Police state four chronicles the sickening depths

1236
01:05:33,260 --> 01:05:35,020
to which our republic has fallen.

1237
01:05:35,020 --> 01:05:37,500
Prepare to enter the secretive world

1238
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:40,220
of emergency dictatorship, body scammers,

1239
01:05:40,220 --> 01:05:43,460
sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror

1240
01:05:43,460 --> 01:05:45,220
and cameras on every street corner.

1241
01:05:45,220 --> 01:05:47,620
It's only the beginning of the new world order's

1242
01:05:47,620 --> 01:05:48,820
hellish plan.

1243
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:50,740
The police state isn't coming.

1244
01:05:50,740 --> 01:05:51,820
It's here.

1248
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:03,900
Now that we have moved into the winter season,

1249
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:05,900
there is an increased need to support

1250
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:07,980
our immunity and health.

1251
01:06:07,980 --> 01:06:11,060
At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs

1252
01:06:11,060 --> 01:06:14,700
by providing a full selection of silver based products.

1253
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:17,020
Our most popular silver based products

1254
01:06:17,020 --> 01:06:19,780
are the 32 ounce nano silver solutions.

1255
01:06:19,780 --> 01:06:22,620
Our two ounce nano silver nasal applicators

1256
01:06:22,620 --> 01:06:25,700
as well as our all natural silver soaps.

1257
01:06:25,700 --> 01:06:29,780
Just released is our 100% natural silver gel.

1258
01:06:29,780 --> 01:06:33,300
Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents

1259
01:06:33,300 --> 01:06:36,820
which quickly evaporate and leave the silver at the surface.

1260
01:06:36,820 --> 01:06:39,380
But rather, we have formulated our silver gel

1261
01:06:39,380 --> 01:06:42,620
using the natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera

1262
01:06:42,620 --> 01:06:45,180
to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin

1263
01:06:45,180 --> 01:06:48,020
while delivering the silver more effectively.

1272
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:15,860
that is several hundred times more effective

1273
01:07:15,860 --> 01:07:18,460
than colloidal or ionic silver.

1274
01:07:18,460 --> 01:07:22,260
Supernatural silver can be taken orally every day

1275
01:07:22,260 --> 01:07:26,180

1276

yeast and molds.

1277
01:07:27,900 --> 01:07:31,940
Supernatural silver is also exceptional for wound care

1278
01:07:31,940 --> 01:07:35,500
and is highly effective for water purification.

1279

Crashing through the lies and disinformation,

1288
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:09,100
it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.

1289
01:08:11,380 --> 01:08:13,880
Alex Jones here, back live into the second hour.

1290
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:18,880
It is Tuesday, the eighth day of January, 2013.

1291
01:08:19,780 --> 01:08:21,220
I am fresh back from New York.

1292
01:08:21,220 --> 01:08:23,820
Literally got in the studio 10 minutes before airtime.

1293
01:08:23,820 --> 01:08:25,540
By the grace of God, our flight took off

1294
01:08:25,540 --> 01:08:26,820
pretty close to on time.

1295
01:08:26,820 --> 01:08:28,720
And I'm here at Aerondox's studio.

1296
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:30,520
Rob Dues doing the nightly news tonight.

1297
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:32,220
He traveled with me, he did a great job

1298
01:08:32,220 --> 01:08:35,740
putting up with what I believe are Bloomberg's goons

1299
01:08:35,740 --> 01:08:38,140
casing us and following us and jumping out of alleyways.

1300
01:08:38,140 --> 01:08:39,660
And, oh, hi, how you doing?

1301
01:08:39,660 --> 01:08:41,220
Just the whole nine yards.

1302
01:08:41,220 --> 01:08:43,220
And we're working with the CNN people when we came out.

1303
01:08:43,220 --> 01:08:44,580
It was just amazing.

1304
01:08:45,700 --> 01:08:47,220
But what's even more incredible,

1305
01:08:47,220 --> 01:08:48,560
and we have these clips coming up.

1306
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:50,820
Most shows would just constantly be playing clips of it.

1307
01:08:50,820 --> 01:08:52,620
I haven't even gotten any clips yet.

1308
01:08:53,620 --> 01:08:56,260
Where they've got all these different CNN hosts

1309
01:08:56,260 --> 01:08:59,460
and advisors, the disgraced Alan Dershowitz,

1310
01:08:59,460 --> 01:09:01,480
but it shows how evil the mainstream media is.

1311
01:09:01,480 --> 01:09:04,300
Oh, he's a good old, you know, well-spoken old man.

1312
01:09:04,300 --> 01:09:06,060
He calls for the government to be able to torture you

1313
01:09:06,060 --> 01:09:07,380
whenever they want.

1314
01:09:07,380 --> 01:09:09,440
You know, like John, you said,

1315
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:11,940
I mean, this is a great man, how liberal.

1316
01:09:11,940 --> 01:09:14,780
You know, drones, wars, well, he's liberal.

1317
01:09:14,780 --> 01:09:16,420
Just like with Obama, he's got a peace prize.

1318
01:09:16,420 --> 01:09:17,400
It must be good.

1319
01:09:18,580 --> 01:09:19,580
I was supposed to debate him.

1320
01:09:19,580 --> 01:09:20,860
They totally chickened out.

1321
01:09:20,860 --> 01:09:23,860
And it was classic.

1322
01:09:23,860 --> 01:09:26,260
I mean, and they were talking in Pierce's ear the whole time.

1323
01:09:26,260 --> 01:09:27,620
They wanted to cut out for the first segment

1324
01:09:27,620 --> 01:09:30,780
when I started attacking their precious sponsor.

1325
01:09:30,780 --> 01:09:32,260
It is a crime.

1326
01:09:32,260 --> 01:09:35,180
And I've had congressmen and women on about this,

1327
01:09:35,180 --> 01:09:38,300
that upwards of 20% of Americans are on dangerous drugs,

1328
01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:39,140
a lot of them kids.

1329
01:09:39,140 --> 01:09:40,960
They put two-year-olds on psychotropics,

1330
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:43,320
folks that attack the brain, the heart, the organs.

1331
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:44,160
And I brought that up.

1332
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:45,340
I said, you're sponsors.

1333
01:09:45,340 --> 01:09:47,500
Because, I mean, it's constant when you watch TV,

1334
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:50,980
the Paxil ads and the Zoloft ads.

1335
01:09:50,980 --> 01:09:54,260
By the way, it'll come out later on the shooter.

1336
01:09:56,220 --> 01:09:58,020
In this case, you know he's under psychiatric care

1337
01:09:58,020 --> 01:10:02,080
and that's his default with the so-called Ashburgers,

1338
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:05,520
probably vaccine damage of the supposed Adam Lanza shooter.

1339
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:09,380
Turns out the Batman shooter, it's official,

1340
01:10:09,380 --> 01:10:12,060
mainstream news, I'm gonna get to that later in my stack,

1341
01:10:12,060 --> 01:10:14,560
that he was on a bunch of medication.

1342
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:15,540
Really?

1343
01:10:15,540 --> 01:10:16,940
And then he just so happened to be

1344
01:10:16,940 --> 01:10:19,860
under a Department of Defense grant paying for everything.

1345
01:10:19,860 --> 01:10:24,140
He just so happened to have a top Air Force psychiatrist

1346
01:10:24,140 --> 01:10:26,020
assigned to him who was over a whole base,

1347
01:10:26,020 --> 01:10:30,140
but moved and spent time with him almost every day.

1348
01:10:30,140 --> 01:10:31,100
And there's big notebooks,

1349
01:10:31,100 --> 01:10:33,600
but that's not gonna look at those.

1350
01:10:35,100 --> 01:10:36,960
This is a psy-op, ladies and gentlemen,

1351
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:37,860
and they're gonna do more.

1352
01:10:37,860 --> 01:10:39,060
Let me tell you why they're so confident

1353
01:10:39,060 --> 01:10:39,880
to go after the guns.

1354
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:40,980
They're going to stage more shootings.

1355
01:10:40,980 --> 01:10:42,600
They're gonna wind up more mentally ill people.

1356
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:44,340
They're gonna do it.

1357
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:46,980
And it's gonna be Bushmaster, Bushmaster, Bushmaster

1358
01:10:46,980 --> 01:10:49,460
to say, see, we can ban one gun, we can ban them all.

1359
01:10:49,460 --> 01:10:50,980
And the bills are introduced to ban your guns

1360
01:10:50,980 --> 01:10:52,180
and physically take them.

1361
01:10:52,180 --> 01:10:53,260
And to have a purge against you.

1362
01:10:53,260 --> 01:10:57,980
So our forebears, Sam Adams spent almost all the money

1363
01:10:57,980 --> 01:11:01,060
he had, one of the wealthiest men in Boston,

1364
01:11:01,060 --> 01:11:02,620
putting out pamphlets for a decade

1365
01:11:02,620 --> 01:11:05,200
because he'd watch Redcoats beat up his friends

1366
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:09,060
and abuse some of his family.

1367
01:11:09,060 --> 01:11:12,020
And he'd watch them as bullies engaged in that type behavior.

1368
01:11:12,020 --> 01:11:15,100
He said, I will do everything I can to bring you down.

1369
01:11:15,100 --> 01:11:19,660
And he also was involved in 1775.

1370
01:11:19,660 --> 01:11:22,320
Whenever Redcoats would beat up citizens of Boston,

1371
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:24,740
the men would get together and go beat them up.

1372
01:11:24,740 --> 01:11:25,960
So it became big street fights.

1373
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:27,860
I mean, men back then, you know,

1374
01:11:27,860 --> 01:11:29,660
oh really, five of you beat up my son?

1375
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:31,020
Well, I'm coming for you.

1376
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:32,140
I was back before all the fluoride

1377
01:11:32,140 --> 01:11:34,700
and all the estrogen and the food and water.

1378
01:11:34,700 --> 01:11:36,940
And you know, some people are timid out there.

1379
01:11:36,940 --> 01:11:39,340
They're like, hey, we need to just be nice and friendly

1380
01:11:39,340 --> 01:11:40,460
with the new world order.

1381
01:11:40,460 --> 01:11:41,300
Let me tell you something,

1382
01:11:41,300 --> 01:11:42,960
that's what got us in this position.

1383
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:43,800
They're arming up.

1384
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:45,100
They're putting their hands on our body.

1385
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:47,100
It's all dog training, submission training.

1386
01:11:47,100 --> 01:11:48,020
They're poisoning us.

1387
01:11:48,020 --> 01:11:48,900
They're dumbing us down.

1388
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:50,220
They're attacking the family.

1389
01:11:50,220 --> 01:11:52,260
They're killing 50 plus million babies.

1390
01:11:52,260 --> 01:11:54,580
Even though abortion is more unpopular than ever,

1391
01:11:54,580 --> 01:11:55,940
they've got more funding for it

1392
01:11:55,940 --> 01:11:57,440
and more abortions than ever.

1393
01:11:59,020 --> 01:11:59,960
It's just amazing.

1394
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:00,800
That's right.

1395
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:01,960
Less people support abortion,

1396
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:04,140
but they're statistically now getting more people

1397
01:12:04,140 --> 01:12:07,020
to have abortions just because the population's gone.

1398
01:12:07,020 --> 01:12:08,860
About 70 plus million since Roe v. Wade,

1399
01:12:08,860 --> 01:12:10,700
but that's a side issue.

1400
01:12:10,700 --> 01:12:13,620
It's a paradox there in the graph.

1401
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:15,140
And I kept trying to get him to respond.

1402
01:12:15,140 --> 01:12:15,960
He goes, let's have a debate.

1403
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:18,140
I'm like, respond to my point, not your point.

1404
01:12:18,140 --> 01:12:20,260
Here are the FBI crimes statistics.

1405
01:12:20,260 --> 01:12:23,700
20 plus percent reduction in the last 15, 16 years.

1406
01:12:23,700 --> 01:12:28,700
This is the last, what is it, 2007 to 11.

1407
01:12:28,780 --> 01:12:29,880
That's four years.

1408
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:30,720
That's the last numbers.

1409
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:32,300
They come out a year late.

1410
01:12:32,300 --> 01:12:33,740
Over a 10% drop.

1411
01:12:33,740 --> 01:12:36,140
And that's fbi.gov.

1412
01:12:36,140 --> 01:12:38,220
I mean, he did not want to do that.

1413
01:12:38,220 --> 01:12:41,260
He wanted to go, what kind of jewels?

1414
01:12:41,260 --> 01:12:44,020
And everybody loved me doing the English accent to him.

1415
01:12:44,020 --> 01:12:46,460
So we're down to the wire here.

1416
01:12:46,460 --> 01:12:47,300
And I'm going to tell you something.

1417
01:12:47,300 --> 01:12:48,260
We routed them.

1418
01:12:48,260 --> 01:12:49,500
That's why they're going to spend tonight

1419
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:50,940
and the next night and night after night

1420
01:12:50,940 --> 01:12:52,260
trying to pile on me.

1421
01:12:52,260 --> 01:12:53,620
And all it's going to do is send people

1422
01:12:53,620 --> 01:12:56,800
to infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.

1423
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:58,900
And no matter what they pull on us,

1424
01:12:58,900 --> 01:13:02,220
liberty lovers, we're not circling the wagons.

1425
01:13:02,220 --> 01:13:03,300
We're on the attack.

1426
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:04,940
They're circling the wagons.

1427
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:09,300
And Rob Dues saw it bigger than Dallas, man.

1428
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:11,100
And I'd go further.

1429
01:13:11,100 --> 01:13:14,780
It's so unbelievable that I held back.

1430
01:13:14,780 --> 01:13:17,760
The one area I'm deceptive in is that truth

1431
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:20,420
is so much crazier than fiction, as they've said,

1432
01:13:20,420 --> 01:13:25,420
that the women that were running the entire operation

1433
01:13:27,660 --> 01:13:29,500
and then later executives, men and women came down.

1434
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:31,500
And it was like 30 people down there.

1435
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:32,340
It was like five people.

1436
01:13:32,340 --> 01:13:33,580
It was like 30 by the time.

1437
01:13:33,580 --> 01:13:35,720
It was like roaches coming out, you know,

1438
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:37,300
when the house catches on fire or something.

1439
01:13:37,300 --> 01:13:39,460
I mean, they were rats pouring out.

1440
01:13:39,460 --> 01:13:43,580
And they were just, and men going,

1441
01:13:43,580 --> 01:13:47,260
ah, ah, ah, and women, ah, ah.

1442
01:13:47,260 --> 01:13:49,300
I mean, multiple women had tears in their eyes,

1443
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:50,140
were hyperventilating.

1444
01:13:50,140 --> 01:13:52,380
I think there was some people probably, you know,

1445
01:13:52,380 --> 01:13:53,740
taking some of their own meds right there.

1446
01:13:53,740 --> 01:13:55,240
I mean, hell, you got to live in New York City

1447
01:13:55,240 --> 01:13:56,140
the way it is now.

1448
01:13:58,140 --> 01:14:01,860
And it was a complete meltdown, okay?

1449
01:14:01,860 --> 01:14:04,460
They basically acted like their ship was sunk.

1450
01:14:04,460 --> 01:14:05,300
And you know why?

1451
01:14:05,300 --> 01:14:06,120
I know why.

1452
01:14:07,380 --> 01:14:10,620
There were boogers smeared on the walls, ladies and gentlemen.

1453
01:14:10,620 --> 01:14:12,700
There were, like I said, I thought,

1454
01:14:12,700 --> 01:14:14,420
did they give us a dirty bathroom on purpose?

1455
01:14:14,420 --> 01:14:15,980
Because I'm not a neat freak.

1456
01:14:15,980 --> 01:14:17,340
But I mean, I don't want to describe this.

1457
01:14:17,340 --> 01:14:20,060
It was like a jail cell I was in once in New York.

1458
01:14:20,060 --> 01:14:22,860
I mean, it was diarrhea splattered on the wall.

1459
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:27,700
I thought it was fitting that Fareed Zarkaria's picture

1460
01:14:27,700 --> 01:14:29,220
was hanging around outside.

1461
01:14:29,220 --> 01:14:30,220
And then I said, well, let me go look around.

1462
01:14:30,220 --> 01:14:31,940
So I started going around looking at other green rooms.

1463
01:14:31,940 --> 01:14:33,540
You could walk through the makeup areas.

1464
01:14:33,540 --> 01:14:38,540
It was all filthy, just a filthy, disgusting facade

1465
01:14:38,660 --> 01:14:40,580
rotting full of termites.

1466
01:14:40,580 --> 01:14:42,540
Aaron Dykes, you've got the floor.

1467
01:14:42,540 --> 01:14:43,420
Your take on all this,

1468
01:14:43,420 --> 01:14:45,180
and we'll start getting to these clips.

1469
01:14:45,180 --> 01:14:46,900
Look, there's different kinds of bullies,

1470
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:48,020
and there's the bully pulpit,

1471
01:14:48,020 --> 01:14:49,540
and we all have our freedom of speech.

1472
01:14:49,540 --> 01:14:52,420
People reacted to the fact that you were so wound up

1473
01:14:52,420 --> 01:14:53,860
and in his face last night.

1474
01:14:53,860 --> 01:14:56,860
It is time for that because he is a different kind of bully,

1475
01:14:56,860 --> 01:14:59,980
not the kind that says, I'm tougher than you, bring it on.

1476
01:14:59,980 --> 01:15:02,980
He is a sneak attacker, and he's been belittling

1477
01:15:02,980 --> 01:15:05,780
and nitpicking and undermining people for weeks,

1478
01:15:05,780 --> 01:15:08,380
specifically his Second Amendment guests.

1479
01:15:08,380 --> 01:15:10,620
Don't remember his name, it was a few weeks ago.

1480
01:15:10,620 --> 01:15:11,500
Larry Pratt.

1481
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:12,540
No, it was someone else.

1482
01:15:12,540 --> 01:15:15,540
They brought him on to talk about the sporting of guns,

1483
01:15:15,540 --> 01:15:18,180
and he was quoted in those lower thirds

1484
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:19,020
that you mentioned.

1485
01:15:19,020 --> 01:15:20,160
They pre-script and get the cards.

1486
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:21,540
What are you about to talk about?

1487
01:15:21,540 --> 01:15:24,660
They had guns are fun while they were rolling pictures

1488
01:15:24,660 --> 01:15:26,100
of the dead kids from Newtown.

1489
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:29,700
The guy was on to talk about firearm sporting and safety

1490
01:15:29,700 --> 01:15:30,640
and how they-

1491
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:32,660
No, no, because they say, we want you to be able to sport.

1492
01:15:32,660 --> 01:15:33,780
That's your Second Amendment.

1493
01:15:33,780 --> 01:15:37,620
Dershowitz said the Second Amendment means he loses his guns.

1494
01:15:37,620 --> 01:15:39,500
We have that clip coming up.

1495
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:42,300
The Second Amendment means he doesn't have guns.

1496
01:15:42,300 --> 01:15:44,660
That's how dumb they think their viewers are.

1497
01:15:44,660 --> 01:15:47,300
They bring these well-put-together hosts,

1498
01:15:47,300 --> 01:15:49,660
Piers Morgan, you mentioned Fareed Zakaria.

1499
01:15:49,660 --> 01:15:51,500
Look at the French woman they just nominated

1500
01:15:51,500 --> 01:15:54,700
for the World Development Economic Post in the articles.

1501
01:15:54,700 --> 01:15:56,060
Oh, she's a genius.

1502
01:15:56,060 --> 01:15:57,180
She's so brilliant.

1503
01:15:57,180 --> 01:15:59,140
She'll bring us 80% taxes like France

1504
01:15:59,140 --> 01:15:59,980
with everyone fleeing.

1505
01:15:59,980 --> 01:16:01,620
Yeah, these foreigners who are pitching us

1506
01:16:01,620 --> 01:16:02,900
towards the socialist, communist-

1507
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:03,980
But that's globalism.

1508
01:16:03,980 --> 01:16:05,180
It's all getting us used

1509
01:16:05,180 --> 01:16:06,980
to foreign corporations occupying us.

1510
01:16:06,980 --> 01:16:08,740
But we're supposed to kneel down to the fact

1511
01:16:08,740 --> 01:16:10,740
that Fareed Zakaria is such a great mind

1512
01:16:10,740 --> 01:16:13,100
when he has no respect for the constitution.

1513
01:16:13,100 --> 01:16:15,060
He loves the Council on Foreign Relations,

1514
01:16:15,060 --> 01:16:17,260
goes to Bilderberg, loves these people.

1515
01:16:17,260 --> 01:16:18,740
And can't even write his own articles.

1516
01:16:18,740 --> 01:16:20,620
And they know full well they're contributing

1517
01:16:20,620 --> 01:16:23,620
to the greatest portions of corruption and displacement.

1518
01:16:23,620 --> 01:16:24,860
Let me tell you, I ran into him

1519
01:16:24,860 --> 01:16:26,780
last time I was at CNN two years ago.

1520
01:16:28,860 --> 01:16:29,860
I ran into him when I was up there.

1521
01:16:29,860 --> 01:16:32,060
I'd done The View and I went over to Joy Behar.

1522
01:16:32,060 --> 01:16:34,140
And I mean, he's just literally,

1523
01:16:34,140 --> 01:16:37,260
he has like little sharp teeth, like a demon.

1524
01:16:37,260 --> 01:16:39,140
And they're so fake and they're nothing.

1525
01:16:39,140 --> 01:16:41,980
They're these little empty ringwraiths.

1526
01:16:41,980 --> 01:16:43,700
They're like animated corpses, man.

1527
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:45,660
I'm telling you, these people are weak.

1528
01:16:45,660 --> 01:16:48,300
That's why they lust for power because they're weak.

1529
01:16:48,300 --> 01:16:49,580
That's it, they do it for power

1530
01:16:49,580 --> 01:16:51,100
because they're not stupid people.

1531
01:16:51,100 --> 01:16:52,860
They can reason through these arguments.

1532
01:16:52,860 --> 01:16:54,580
They know they're stacking the deck

1533
01:16:54,580 --> 01:16:56,060
with these weak arguments

1534
01:16:56,060 --> 01:16:58,140
and just presenting it the way they want to.

1535
01:16:58,140 --> 01:17:00,100
And they're playing with our emotional strings.

1536
01:17:00,100 --> 01:17:01,660
And it just makes me sick

1537
01:17:01,660 --> 01:17:03,620
because I understand the Second Amendment.

1538
01:17:03,620 --> 01:17:05,500
The more I look into the founding fathers

1539
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:06,500
in the history of America,

1540
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:08,820
the more I'm blown away,

1541
01:17:08,820 --> 01:17:10,580
how much they had the forethought to it.

1542
01:17:10,580 --> 01:17:14,500
I mean, they tried to establish a balance of power.

1543
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:16,180
They looked at each other in the room

1544
01:17:16,180 --> 01:17:18,860
and realized they wouldn't want any one of them

1545
01:17:18,860 --> 01:17:20,980
to be their king or their dictator.

1546
01:17:20,980 --> 01:17:22,780
They tried to split up those powers

1547
01:17:22,780 --> 01:17:25,420
and they're undermining all of it systematically, Alex.

1548
01:17:25,420 --> 01:17:27,260
A bunch of them were inventors.

1549
01:17:27,260 --> 01:17:28,860
Most of them spoke like five languages.

1550
01:17:28,860 --> 01:17:30,900
They were the greatest expression

1551
01:17:30,900 --> 01:17:32,420
of the Renaissance and the Enlightenment.

1552
01:17:32,420 --> 01:17:35,020
They were just, I mean, I don't worship men,

1553
01:17:35,020 --> 01:17:36,380
but I've studied the philosophers.

1554
01:17:36,380 --> 01:17:37,860
I've read pretty much all of them.

1555
01:17:37,860 --> 01:17:41,420
Our founding fathers were incredible people.

1556
01:17:41,420 --> 01:17:43,460
That's why I saw Michael Moore going,

1557
01:17:43,460 --> 01:17:44,380
why do we care about this?

1558
01:17:44,380 --> 01:17:45,220
Why do we like it?

1559
01:17:45,220 --> 01:17:47,740
Because it was the worldwide declaration of liberty.

1560
01:17:47,740 --> 01:17:50,100
It's the example against all the tyranny.

1561
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:52,020
Everything they want to bring back is ancient.

1562
01:17:52,020 --> 01:17:54,340
They're the ones bringing old tyranny back.

1563
01:17:54,340 --> 01:17:56,820
They disingenuously try to talk about flintlocks.

1564
01:17:56,820 --> 01:17:59,700
No, it's the nature of man to try to dominate

1565
01:17:59,700 --> 01:18:02,340
and use power, whatever the tools of the day.

1566
01:18:02,340 --> 01:18:04,500
It has nothing to do with technology

1567
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:06,220
or how advanced firepower it is.

1568
01:18:06,220 --> 01:18:08,700
It's about trying to discourage that bad behavior.

1569
01:18:08,700 --> 01:18:10,060
It's about a separation of power.

1570
01:18:10,060 --> 01:18:13,860
I don't trust, they're saying they don't trust me with guns.

1571
01:18:13,860 --> 01:18:16,380
Guaranteed trying to get the ATF to raid me or something.

1572
01:18:16,380 --> 01:18:17,500
Good, make my day.

1573
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:21,700
Make me a martyr, come after me, do whatever you want.

1574
01:18:23,300 --> 01:18:24,820
I'm ready for you to come set me up.

1575
01:18:24,820 --> 01:18:25,660
Don't you get it?

1576
01:18:25,660 --> 01:18:29,500
I've chosen to stand for the truth and you fail.

1577
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:32,540
No matter what you do to me, you can't win.

1578
01:18:32,540 --> 01:18:34,300
And we have to have that example.

1579
01:18:34,300 --> 01:18:38,060
But I'd say 90 plus percent of our listeners and viewers

1580
01:18:38,060 --> 01:18:39,980
really understand what I did and appreciate it

1581
01:18:39,980 --> 01:18:41,220
because I was so disgusted with them.

1582
01:18:41,220 --> 01:18:43,020
And that's why it's such a big news.

1583
01:18:43,020 --> 01:18:45,980
They are in panic mode because they thought

1584
01:18:45,980 --> 01:18:47,780
they were gonna sit there and play games.

1585
01:18:47,780 --> 01:18:49,980
He had like five cards about,

1586
01:18:49,980 --> 01:18:51,060
well, how many people died in this shooting?

1587
01:18:51,060 --> 01:18:51,900
Well, how many didn't know?

1588
01:18:51,900 --> 01:18:53,900
Just so I could go, I don't remember.

1589
01:18:53,900 --> 01:18:54,740
Just like I could have said,

1590
01:18:54,740 --> 01:18:57,420
how many seats are there on double decker bus?

1591
01:18:57,420 --> 01:18:58,820
No, I know, exactly.

1592
01:18:58,820 --> 01:19:01,020
And it reminds me of this guy I knew in college

1593
01:19:01,020 --> 01:19:03,180
who's kind of obsessive compulsive,

1594
01:19:03,180 --> 01:19:04,940
really wanted to know about the latest cameras,

1595
01:19:04,940 --> 01:19:07,260
all their features, the technical things they could do,

1596
01:19:07,260 --> 01:19:10,460
got really caught up and would argue with my old boss

1597
01:19:10,460 --> 01:19:11,500
for hours at a time.

1598
01:19:11,500 --> 01:19:13,860
And my boss finally said, look, it's a tool.

1599
01:19:13,860 --> 01:19:15,620
It has to do with what story you're gonna tell

1600
01:19:15,620 --> 01:19:18,020
with the camera, not the individual features

1601
01:19:18,020 --> 01:19:20,820
and which one has a bigger pixel size and things like that.

1602
01:19:20,820 --> 01:19:22,100
What are you gonna do with the camera?

1603
01:19:22,100 --> 01:19:22,980
What is your intent?

1604
01:19:22,980 --> 01:19:25,500
And no one will ask about these psychological

1605
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:26,860
mass killing shooters.

1606
01:19:26,860 --> 01:19:27,700
What is their motive?

1607
01:19:27,700 --> 01:19:29,300
They admit they don't know Lanza's motive.

1608
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:32,020
Well, there is no motive to kill innocent children.

1609
01:19:32,020 --> 01:19:35,420
By the way, we didn't touch this story.

1610
01:19:35,420 --> 01:19:37,620
There's now, but we saw the same thing.

1611
01:19:37,620 --> 01:19:39,620
They have these reenactors that do these fake shootings

1612
01:19:39,620 --> 01:19:41,940
all over the country to create the perception

1613
01:19:41,940 --> 01:19:43,900
of a mass killing, sometimes unannounced.

1614
01:19:43,900 --> 01:19:46,740
South Florida Sun Sentinel, FAU professor

1615
01:19:46,740 --> 01:19:50,620
shares conspiracy by disputing Newtown massacre

1616
01:19:50,620 --> 01:19:54,140
and is saying there were at least some actors there.

1617
01:19:54,140 --> 01:19:55,740
They're definitely coaching people.

1618
01:19:55,740 --> 01:19:59,220
I'll say, yeah, exactly.

1619
01:19:59,220 --> 01:20:00,500
I think you're mic's off, we'll be right back.

1620
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:03,060
Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves,

1621
01:20:03,060 --> 01:20:05,660
how did we ever survive from natural disasters

1622
01:20:05,660 --> 01:20:08,460
like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought

1623
01:20:08,460 --> 01:20:11,980
to the family hardships brought on by a disastrous economy?

1624
01:20:11,980 --> 01:20:14,660
Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything.

1625
01:20:14,660 --> 01:20:17,140
At eFoods Direct, we hear from customers every day

1626
01:20:17,140 --> 01:20:19,420

1627

by having a supply of food on hand.

1628
01:20:21,220 --> 01:20:24,380
After Hurricane Sandy, Danny from New York City wrote,

1629
01:20:24,380 --> 01:20:26,820
almost all of the grocery stores are closed,

1630
01:20:26,820 --> 01:20:29,580
but I managed to get my eFoods just in time

1631
01:20:29,580 --> 01:20:31,620
to be able to help my sister and niece.

1632
01:20:31,620 --> 01:20:34,300
It is better to be prepared 10 years too early

1633
01:20:34,300 --> 01:20:35,620
than one day too late.

1634
01:20:35,620 --> 01:20:37,740
I can warn you, but I can't feed you.

1635
01:20:37,740 --> 01:20:40,020

The raw probiotic.

1668
01:21:59,580 --> 01:22:02,580
On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years

1669
01:22:02,580 --> 01:22:05,140
hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out

1670
01:22:05,140 --> 01:22:06,260
their golden years.

1671
01:22:06,260 --> 01:22:08,980
Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost

1672
01:22:08,980 --> 01:22:12,140
of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees

1673
01:22:12,140 --> 01:22:14,380
are forced to live below the poverty line.

1674
01:22:14,380 --> 01:22:15,980
Is this a flaw-free enterprise?

1675
01:22:15,980 --> 01:22:18,180
Or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve

1676
01:22:18,180 --> 01:22:20,300
Note forcing us into perpetual debt,

1677
01:22:20,300 --> 01:22:22,580
ensuring inflation and higher taxes?

1678
01:22:22,580 --> 01:22:24,260
These questions and more can be answered

1679
01:22:24,260 --> 01:22:26,540
by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature

1680
01:22:26,540 --> 01:22:27,660
from Jekyll Island.

1681
01:22:27,660 --> 01:22:29,460
Congressman Ron Paul states, it's

1682
01:22:29,460 --> 01:22:32,860
what every American needs to know about central bank power,

1683
01:22:32,860 --> 01:22:35,020
a gripping adventure into the secret world

1684
01:22:35,020 --> 01:22:37,100
of international banking cartel.

1685
01:22:37,100 --> 01:22:38,300
Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

1686
01:22:38,300 --> 01:22:40,780
I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s

1687
01:22:40,780 --> 01:22:42,820
to anyone who purchases this book.

01:22:42,820 --> 01:22:47,700
Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.

1689
01:22:47,700 --> 01:22:50,700
It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

01:22:50,700 --> 01:22:55,580
Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.

1691
01:22:55,580 --> 01:23:00,540
That's 1-800-686-2237.

1692
01:23:00,540 --> 01:23:04,500
You land in Buenos Aires, then a shuttle to Santa Rosa,

1693
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:08,100
where a nicely furnished cabin with all amenities, Wi-Fi,

1694
01:23:08,100 --> 01:23:11,980
executive food and wine, and laundry service awaits.

1695
01:23:11,980 --> 01:23:15,460
After a good night's sleep, your adventure begins.

1696
01:23:15,460 --> 01:23:19,900
You're on a golden stag safari for big game.

1697
01:23:19,900 --> 01:23:21,180
But it's not Africa.

1698
01:23:21,180 --> 01:23:22,740
It's Argentina.

1699
01:23:22,740 --> 01:23:25,420
One-on-one guided hunts for water buffalo,

1700
01:23:25,420 --> 01:23:29,740
huger, bighorn rams, wild boar, and the biggest stag

1701
01:23:29,740 --> 01:23:31,460
deer in South America.

1702
01:23:31,460 --> 01:23:33,420
All gold medal quality.

1703
01:23:33,420 --> 01:23:36,500
All the action you can handle.

1704
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:40,300
Land rovers, top rental guns with scopes, all food,

1705
01:23:40,300 --> 01:23:43,020
beverages, hunting guides, ground transportation

1706
01:23:43,020 --> 01:23:44,580
included, and more.

1707
01:23:44,580 --> 01:23:47,580
All more affordable than you can imagine.

1708
01:23:47,580 --> 01:23:52,740
The adventure of a lifetime starts at GoldenStagSafaris.com.

1709
01:23:52,740 --> 01:23:54,820
The big game hunting ranch.

1710
01:23:54,820 --> 01:23:56,460
GoldenStagSafaris.com.

1711
01:24:04,940 --> 01:24:06,620
Yeah, take a look out your window.

1712
01:24:06,620 --> 01:24:10,500
There's a sight you'd like to see.

1713
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:11,940
Welcome back.

1714
01:24:11,940 --> 01:24:13,860
Look out your window, baby.

1715
01:24:13,860 --> 01:24:16,500
There's a scene you'd like to catch.

1716
01:24:16,500 --> 01:24:18,660
All right, we're going to be taking your phone

1717
01:24:18,660 --> 01:24:22,340
calls at 800-25-99231.

1718
01:24:22,340 --> 01:24:25,180
And here's the deal.

1719
01:24:25,180 --> 01:24:27,300
I am ready to be destroyed for liberty.

1720
01:24:31,540 --> 01:24:32,580
I want to be clear about that.

1721
01:24:32,580 --> 01:24:33,860
I'm nonviolent.

1722
01:24:33,860 --> 01:24:35,620
I use information to get my job done.

1723
01:24:35,620 --> 01:24:38,500
But I physically have decided that not only

1724
01:24:38,500 --> 01:24:42,300
is it worth it to be shut up and present or killed,

1725
01:24:42,300 --> 01:24:47,180
that I would climb the highest mountain

1726
01:24:47,180 --> 01:24:48,860
or attempt to defeat tyranny.

1727
01:24:48,860 --> 01:24:51,860
I would swim the largest ocean.

1728
01:24:51,860 --> 01:24:53,860
Ain't no mountain high enough.

1729
01:24:53,860 --> 01:24:54,540
What's that song?

1730
01:24:54,540 --> 01:24:56,220
We didn't even have that in the computer.

1731
01:24:56,220 --> 01:24:57,260
I'm committed.

1732
01:24:57,260 --> 01:24:58,660
I'm weak.

1733
01:24:58,660 --> 01:24:59,820
I'm just flesh and blood.

1734
01:24:59,820 --> 01:25:01,980
I've asked God to make me strong.

1735
01:25:01,980 --> 01:25:08,700
And God works with the pathetic bits that I've got here.

1736
01:25:08,700 --> 01:25:11,380
800-25-99231.

1737
01:25:11,380 --> 01:25:14,620
But they believe they've been crushed and defeated.

1738
01:25:14,620 --> 01:25:17,460
They're now going to reorganize and come after us viciously.

1739
01:25:17,460 --> 01:25:18,940
And they're saying get rid of my free speech.

1740
01:25:18,940 --> 01:25:20,700
We've got a bunch of articles printing, a bunch of news

1741
01:25:20,700 --> 01:25:21,700
clips coming up.

1742
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:23,540
I mean, you're seeing it out there.

1743
01:25:23,540 --> 01:25:25,780
Alex Jones should not have this platform.

1744
01:25:25,780 --> 01:25:27,420
Alex Jones should not have these guns.

1745
01:25:27,420 --> 01:25:28,740
I'm scared he has guns.

1746
01:25:28,740 --> 01:25:32,140
I mean, ladies and gentlemen, my guns embarrassingly

1747
01:25:32,140 --> 01:25:35,540
are rusting in gun safes.

1748
01:25:35,540 --> 01:25:37,780
Because I've got stuff that grandpa passed on

1749
01:25:37,780 --> 01:25:39,540
and the other grandpa passed on.

1750
01:25:39,540 --> 01:25:43,100
And I say I got 50 guns, a lot of them are antiques.

1751
01:25:43,100 --> 01:25:46,100
I got one that's an old black powder back

1752
01:25:46,100 --> 01:25:47,580
when they wove the shotguns.

1753
01:25:47,580 --> 01:25:49,420
I mean, it's probably worth a lot of money.

1754
01:25:49,420 --> 01:25:51,580
The point I never sell it is like great granddaddies,

1755
01:25:51,580 --> 01:25:53,500
great, great granddaddies that he

1756
01:25:53,500 --> 01:25:55,020
shoot turkeys with and stuff.

1757
01:25:55,020 --> 01:25:57,140
The point is that I don't even have time to go out

1758
01:25:57,140 --> 01:25:59,140
and shoot before five times a year now I'm so busy.

1759
01:25:59,140 --> 01:26:00,180
Even though I'll move to the country,

1760
01:26:00,180 --> 01:26:01,220
I don't because I'm here.

1761
01:26:01,220 --> 01:26:02,500
I'm fighting.

1762
01:26:02,500 --> 01:26:06,300
And when I do, it's for training with my children.

1763
01:26:06,300 --> 01:26:09,780
But now they want my First Amendment

1764
01:26:09,780 --> 01:26:12,820
and they're coming after me.

1765
01:26:12,820 --> 01:26:15,140
Because that means they're coming after you.

1766
01:26:15,140 --> 01:26:16,500
Because they're a bunch of gangsters

1767
01:26:16,500 --> 01:26:19,500
and they've got to let you know that you're their slave

1768
01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:21,580
and that they're going to predator drone your butt.

1769
01:26:21,580 --> 01:26:25,300
They're going to arm with 1.6 million bullets.

1770
01:26:25,300 --> 01:26:27,540
They're going to get all the armored personnel carriers.

1771
01:26:27,540 --> 01:26:29,140
They're going to federalize the police.

1772
01:26:29,140 --> 01:26:33,540
They're going to have torture command bases and all this.

1773
01:26:33,540 --> 01:26:35,140
But you shouldn't be worried about them

1774
01:26:35,140 --> 01:26:38,700
because they're talking sweet, little, soft, NPR,

1775
01:26:38,700 --> 01:26:40,060
Piers Morgan voices.

1776
01:26:40,060 --> 01:26:41,660
Aaron Dykes, final comments on this.

1777
01:26:41,660 --> 01:26:43,460
I know you're going to be filing special reports

1778
01:26:43,460 --> 01:26:46,580
on the nightly news tonight, riding shotgun with Rob Duke.

1779
01:26:46,580 --> 01:26:48,180
The point I was trying to make earlier, Alex,

1780
01:26:48,180 --> 01:26:50,580
is that an assault weapon is any object,

1781
01:26:50,580 --> 01:26:54,660
any device that someone uses with the motive to cause harm.

1782
01:26:54,660 --> 01:26:57,500
But Piers Morgan last night, again and again,

1783
01:26:57,500 --> 01:26:59,260
tried to nickel and dime you with statistics

1784
01:26:59,260 --> 01:27:01,420
of what weapon did that killer use?

1785
01:27:01,420 --> 01:27:03,340
What weapon did this killer use?

1786
01:27:03,340 --> 01:27:06,620
And you named it with a precise model and caliber.

1787
01:27:06,620 --> 01:27:07,180
He didn't care.

1788
01:27:07,180 --> 01:27:10,260
He wanted to remind you that was an assault weapon, which

1789
01:27:10,260 --> 01:27:13,780
we know is a particular branded politicized term

1790
01:27:13,780 --> 01:27:16,100
to reintroduce this legislation, which

1791
01:27:16,100 --> 01:27:19,980
we know the Obama administration planned to do all along.

1792
01:27:19,980 --> 01:27:23,260
Eric Holder admitted it in the first month Obama was in office.

1793
01:27:23,260 --> 01:27:25,380
And Rahm Emanuel told him to STFU,

1794
01:27:25,380 --> 01:27:27,980
to expletive shut up and stop talking about it,

1795
01:27:27,980 --> 01:27:29,980
because they were doing it under the radar.

1796
01:27:29,980 --> 01:27:31,980
And they want to get people in that TV mode,

1797
01:27:31,980 --> 01:27:34,100
bypass the rational, reasonable thing.

1798
01:27:34,100 --> 01:27:35,100
Exactly.

1799
01:27:35,100 --> 01:27:38,540
Listen, bare minimum, her bill makes me take all my guns in

1800
01:27:38,540 --> 01:27:39,940
and re-register them with the ATF,

1801
01:27:39,940 --> 01:27:42,180
and they decide if I can keep them as a forced buyback

1802
01:27:42,180 --> 01:27:42,660
provision.

1803
01:27:42,660 --> 01:27:44,380
And they're doing interviews saying it.

1804
01:27:44,380 --> 01:27:47,060
And then Piers is like, I just want your guns for hunting.

1805
01:27:47,060 --> 01:27:48,220
And like you said, they were demonizing

1806
01:27:48,220 --> 01:27:49,260
hunting the week before.

1807
01:27:49,260 --> 01:27:51,060
They're going after it all.

1808
01:27:51,060 --> 01:27:53,620
They've introduced the legislation.

1809
01:27:53,620 --> 01:27:57,380
And we've got Obama and Biden four years ago saying,

1810
01:27:57,380 --> 01:27:58,900
I will never come after your guns.

1811
01:27:58,900 --> 01:28:00,260
That's a lie.

1812
01:28:00,260 --> 01:28:02,060
When Sarah Brady says, don't worry,

1813
01:28:02,060 --> 01:28:04,300
we're going to get them next term under the radar.

1814
01:28:04,300 --> 01:28:05,380
They're coming.

1815
01:28:05,380 --> 01:28:06,500
And they're a bunch of liars.

1816
01:28:06,500 --> 01:28:10,380
And I'm not under your mind control, you snot-nosed bastard.

1817
01:28:10,380 --> 01:28:11,260
You got that?

1818
01:28:11,260 --> 01:28:14,020
I'm red blooded, and I ain't bending over.

1819
01:28:14,020 --> 01:28:16,260
And I'm not going to your FEMA camp.

1820
01:28:16,260 --> 01:28:17,580
You got it?

1821
01:28:17,580 --> 01:28:19,820
These people are dangerous.

1822
01:28:19,820 --> 01:28:21,140
They're taking over.

1823
01:28:21,140 --> 01:28:22,700
They're authoritarians.

1824
01:28:22,700 --> 01:28:24,500
Danger, danger.

1825
01:28:24,500 --> 01:28:26,380
They try to trick us with the emotional play

1826
01:28:26,380 --> 01:28:29,300
of showing these children Alex murders a horrible thing.

1827
01:28:29,300 --> 01:28:31,140
It's horrible what happened to these children.

1828
01:28:31,140 --> 01:28:33,580
But when someone gets jealous of a wife or a husband,

1829
01:28:33,580 --> 01:28:35,380
or when they commit a robbery and want

1830
01:28:35,380 --> 01:28:37,860
to gain something physical, and so they commit murder,

1831
01:28:37,860 --> 01:28:38,620
there's a motive.

1832
01:28:38,620 --> 01:28:39,980
There's a reason they did it.

1833
01:28:39,980 --> 01:28:42,020
Of course, they should be prosecuted and jailed.

1834
01:28:42,020 --> 01:28:45,260
But these mass murder shooters had no motive to kill people

1835
01:28:45,260 --> 01:28:46,060
they didn't know.

1836
01:28:46,060 --> 01:28:46,580
No, no.

1837
01:28:46,580 --> 01:28:47,860
They're Prozac heads programmed.

1838
01:28:47,860 --> 01:28:48,660
That's what I mean.

1839
01:28:48,660 --> 01:28:49,500
Do you hear me say?

1840
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:52,340
The media tells the shooters, go out and kill everybody.

1841
01:28:52,340 --> 01:28:54,340
Yes, when people take those SSRIs,

1842
01:28:54,340 --> 01:28:57,220
they pour gasoline and self-emulate themselves, Alex.

1843
01:28:57,220 --> 01:28:58,460
They'll find any weapon.

1844
01:28:58,460 --> 01:28:58,980
Shrimp.

1845
01:28:58,980 --> 01:29:02,980
Because they've done studies with shrimps and rodents.

1846
01:29:02,980 --> 01:29:07,660
Rodents will walk right up to wolves and be eaten.

1847
01:29:07,660 --> 01:29:09,740
Shrimp will swim right up to a fish.

1848
01:29:09,740 --> 01:29:12,100
It destroys inhibition.

1849
01:29:12,100 --> 01:29:14,340
And by the way, a woman on these drugs,

1850
01:29:14,340 --> 01:29:16,260
you want to court the woman.

1851
01:29:16,260 --> 01:29:17,620
You want her to be into you.

1852
01:29:17,620 --> 01:29:20,540
Women who are on these drugs, man, their skirts

1853
01:29:20,540 --> 01:29:21,460
are off so fast.

1854
01:29:21,460 --> 01:29:23,700
I hate to get into this, folks, but I lived a little

1855
01:29:23,700 --> 01:29:24,620
before I got married.

1856
01:29:24,620 --> 01:29:25,700
I mean, I didn't like it.

1857
01:29:25,700 --> 01:29:26,700
These women weren't there.

1858
01:29:26,700 --> 01:29:28,860
And if you're a woman on this, I'm not judging you.

1859
01:29:28,860 --> 01:29:30,340
But let me just tell you, their pants

1860
01:29:30,340 --> 01:29:32,140
come off so fast it makes your head spin.

1861
01:29:32,140 --> 01:29:33,060
And I don't want that.

1862
01:29:33,060 --> 01:29:35,340
I want a woman to really like me.

1863
01:29:35,340 --> 01:29:36,460
God help us, Aaron.

1864
01:29:36,460 --> 01:29:37,540
Anything else you want to add?

1865
01:29:37,540 --> 01:29:39,580
Well, it's just the only people to gain from this

1866
01:29:39,580 --> 01:29:41,660
are government who want to sell the fear on this

1867
01:29:41,660 --> 01:29:43,620
so they can implement their control agenda.

1868
01:29:43,620 --> 01:29:44,380
Absolutely.

1869
01:29:44,380 --> 01:29:46,300
It's obvious, and I'm calling their bluff.

1870
01:29:46,300 --> 01:29:47,620
The hoax is over.

1871
01:29:47,620 --> 01:29:48,500
We'll be right back.

1872
01:29:48,500 --> 01:29:49,300
Stay with us.

1873
01:29:49,300 --> 01:29:50,700
We're on the march.

1874
01:29:50,700 --> 01:29:53,140
The empire's on the run.

1875
01:29:53,140 --> 01:30:00,180
Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

1876
01:30:00,180 --> 01:30:00,700
Hello.

1877
01:30:00,700 --> 01:30:03,060
Alex Jones here with a very important announcement

1878
01:30:03,060 --> 01:30:04,220
for truth seekers.

1879
01:30:04,220 --> 01:30:06,500
We've carried a lot of amazing films and books

1880
01:30:06,500 --> 01:30:08,780
over the years on the online video bookstore

1881
01:30:08,780 --> 01:30:10,140

1882
01:30:10,140 --> 01:30:12,020
And out of all the titles we've carried,

1883
01:30:12,020 --> 01:30:16,740
one stands out because it is just so chillingly convincing.

1884
01:30:16,740 --> 01:30:20,060
And that's Dreams From My Real Father by Joel Gilbert,

1885
01:30:20,060 --> 01:30:22,420
available at Infowars.com.

1886

This film exposes the fraud that Obama

1887
01:30:24,900 --> 01:30:26,260
is like nothing I've seen.

1888
01:30:26,260 --> 01:30:28,740
If you want to know who Obama's real daddy is,

1889
01:30:28,740 --> 01:30:30,020
this is the film for you.

You'll also find it at Infowarshop.com.

1893
01:30:37,100 --> 01:30:39,460
None Dare Call a Conspiracy by Gary Allen,

1894
01:30:39,460 --> 01:30:41,020
the book that woke me up.

1895
01:30:41,020 --> 01:30:44,500
We're also carrying Behind the Green Mask, UN Agenda 21,

1896
01:30:44,500 --> 01:30:45,420
by Rosa Corey.

1897
01:30:45,420 --> 01:30:48,380
This book is coffin nails to the globalist takeover.

1898
01:30:48,380 --> 01:30:51,340
The Greater Good, the most professional and up-to-date

1899
01:30:51,340 --> 01:30:55,220
film I've ever seen exposing the scourge that is vaccines.

1900
01:30:55,220 --> 01:30:58,180
These titles and a lot more are all available

1901
01:30:58,180 --> 01:31:00,580
at Infowarshop.com.

1902
01:31:00,580 --> 01:31:02,860
Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks

1903
01:31:02,860 --> 01:31:04,060
adding poison to your water

1904
01:31:04,060 --> 01:31:06,060
and laughing as you get sick and die?

1905
01:31:06,060 --> 01:31:08,500
Start purifying your water with ProPure.

1906
01:31:08,500 --> 01:31:10,340
My friends, I've done a lot of research

1907
01:31:10,340 --> 01:31:14,220
and the best gravity filter out there bar none is ProPure.

1908
01:31:14,220 --> 01:31:17,580
And it's available discounted at Infowars.com.

1909
01:31:17,580 --> 01:31:19,500
Its filters are silver impregnated

1910
01:31:19,500 --> 01:31:21,060
to prevent bacterial growth.

1911
01:31:21,060 --> 01:31:22,660
There's no priming required.

1912
01:31:22,660 --> 01:31:24,940
It's NSF 42 certified.

1913
01:31:24,940 --> 01:31:28,540
Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.

1914
01:31:28,540 --> 01:31:30,100
Easy to set up and use.

1915
01:31:30,100 --> 01:31:31,540
Doesn't require electricity.

1916
01:31:31,540 --> 01:31:34,700
Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.

1917
01:31:34,700 --> 01:31:37,300
This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals,

1918
01:31:37,300 --> 01:31:38,140
which is key.

1919
01:31:38,140 --> 01:31:39,980
Save money by not buying bottled water

1920
01:31:39,980 --> 01:31:42,220
and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.

1921
01:31:42,220 --> 01:31:44,940
ProPure is the best gravity fed filter out there.

1922
01:31:44,940 --> 01:31:46,500
It's what my family uses.

1923

1928
01:32:02,900 --> 01:32:04,740
from colds, flu, and other illnesses.

1929

1932
01:32:11,660 --> 01:32:13,660
Recent advances in silver technology

01:32:13,660 --> 01:32:15,500
have resulted in a silver solution

1934
01:32:15,500 --> 01:32:18,460

1935
01:32:18,460 --> 01:32:21,380
mold, and food poisoning, and help improve wound healing.

1936
01:32:21,380 --> 01:32:24,620
Supernatural Silver is safe enough to consume every day,

1937
01:32:24,620 --> 01:32:26,740

1938
01:32:26,740 --> 01:32:30,100
of many serious diseases, such as strep, staph, pneumonia,

1939
01:32:30,100 --> 01:32:32,580
colds, flus, and other harmful pathogens.

1940
01:32:32,580 --> 01:32:34,460
This new technology has the ability

1941
01:32:34,460 --> 01:32:37,100
to terminate entire colonies of harmful bacteria

1942
01:32:37,100 --> 01:32:39,060
at several hundred times the effectiveness

1943
01:32:39,060 --> 01:32:41,700
of colloidal or ionic silver solutions.

1944
01:32:41,700 --> 01:32:43,220
The Science Digest Journal says,

1945
01:32:43,220 --> 01:32:45,300
silver is our mightiest germ fighter.

1946
01:32:45,300 --> 01:32:47,540
It is virtually non-toxic and is emerging

1947
01:32:47,540 --> 01:32:49,180
as a wonder of modern medicine.

After this, there is no turning back.

1953
01:33:13,020 --> 01:33:16,660
You take the blue pill, the story ends,

1954
01:33:16,660 --> 01:33:20,100
you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to do.

1955
01:33:20,100 --> 01:33:24,220
You take the red pill, you stay in wonderland,

1956
01:33:24,220 --> 01:33:28,780
and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.

1957
01:33:28,780 --> 01:33:33,780
Remember, all I'm offering is the truth, nothing more.

1958
01:33:35,940 --> 01:33:41,460
The answer to 1984 is 1776.

1959
01:33:41,460 --> 01:33:45,940
You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.

1960
01:33:45,940 --> 01:33:48,860
Americans have such incredible hospitality.

1961
01:33:48,860 --> 01:33:52,540
Can you imagine if I went to France or England or Russia

1962
01:33:52,540 --> 01:33:54,900
and had a national TV show telling them

1963
01:33:54,900 --> 01:33:57,100
to change their laws and lecturing them,

1964
01:33:57,100 --> 01:34:01,300
they would run me out on a stinking rail.

1965
01:34:01,300 --> 01:34:03,260
Foreigners who aren't even citizens,

1966
01:34:03,260 --> 01:34:04,900
there's one thing if you're a citizen,

1967
01:34:04,900 --> 01:34:06,580
been here, built something, done something,

1968
01:34:06,580 --> 01:34:08,180
then we want you, we claim you as our own.

1969
01:34:08,180 --> 01:34:10,460
I don't care where you're from or what your religion is

1970
01:34:10,460 --> 01:34:12,020
or whatever it is, you're ours.

1971
01:34:12,020 --> 01:34:15,740
But you have some guy fleeing all these criminal inquiries

1972
01:34:15,740 --> 01:34:19,020
and fired for faking news over here,

1973
01:34:19,020 --> 01:34:22,660
and I'm just sick of being lectured by fake snot noses.

1974
01:34:23,900 --> 01:34:26,300
I could get up here on this radio broadcast

1975
01:34:26,300 --> 01:34:30,220
and get into the role of being incredibly polite

1976
01:34:30,220 --> 01:34:34,220
but also manipulative, and it's actually a mindset

1977
01:34:36,100 --> 01:34:38,580
that I could shift into here today

1978
01:34:38,580 --> 01:34:40,620
and behave like Piers Morgan,

1979
01:34:40,620 --> 01:34:44,340
but even more affected and say,

1980
01:34:44,340 --> 01:34:46,340
you have the blood of those children on your hands,

1981
01:34:46,340 --> 01:34:47,860
these mass shootings,

1982
01:34:47,860 --> 01:34:51,140
and we're going to civilize this nation, Mr. Jones.

1983
01:34:51,140 --> 01:34:52,900
We're going to do it.

1984
01:34:52,900 --> 01:34:57,500
And your barbarian activities will not stop us, will you?

1985
01:34:57,500 --> 01:35:00,460
I mean, they just, it's so outrageous,

1986
01:35:00,460 --> 01:35:04,060
and I for one am done, and so their spin is,

1987
01:35:04,060 --> 01:35:06,380
I can't think of a better poster child

1988
01:35:06,380 --> 01:35:08,820
for gun control than Alex Jones.

1989
01:35:08,820 --> 01:35:11,220
Yes, he does talk to our lawyer

1990
01:35:11,220 --> 01:35:12,540
that wants to secretly arrest people

1991
01:35:12,540 --> 01:35:13,620
and have them tortured.

1992
01:35:13,620 --> 01:35:16,900
Alan Deshouetz, looking like Emperor Palpatine.

1993
01:35:16,900 --> 01:35:18,140
What should we do?

1994
01:35:18,140 --> 01:35:20,980
Well, yes, torture is very good,

1995
01:35:20,980 --> 01:35:23,700
and drone attacks, and no rule of law.

1996
01:35:23,700 --> 01:35:27,220
I'm liberal, it's good, yes.

1997
01:35:27,220 --> 01:35:30,140
I mean, it's all BS.

1998
01:35:30,140 --> 01:35:31,940
Emperor's wearing no clothes.

1999
01:35:31,940 --> 01:35:33,460
I call baloney.

2000
01:35:33,460 --> 01:35:34,860
I'm done.

2001
01:35:34,860 --> 01:35:35,940
I'm done.

2002
01:35:35,940 --> 01:35:39,420
You've used our energy, our money, our name

2003
01:35:39,420 --> 01:35:40,740
to build the new world order

2004
01:35:40,740 --> 01:35:42,500
and run around killing millions of people,

2005
01:35:42,500 --> 01:35:44,660
a million Iraqis, British lands at Journal.

2006
01:35:46,060 --> 01:35:48,700
And I will not have it done in my name anymore.

2007
01:35:48,700 --> 01:35:50,380
Red coat usurper.

2008
01:35:52,540 --> 01:35:55,420
And I know why my forebearers stood up against you.

2009
01:35:56,860 --> 01:36:00,380
And I know why my forebearers stood up against Santa Ana,

2010
01:36:00,380 --> 01:36:01,660
and many of you out there listening

2011
01:36:01,660 --> 01:36:02,980
have forebearers as well.

2012
01:36:04,020 --> 01:36:05,860
Because you weren't perfect,

2013
01:36:05,860 --> 01:36:08,620
but your ancestors came here to get away from the insiders,

2014
01:36:08,620 --> 01:36:10,500
to get away from rigged games,

2015
01:36:10,500 --> 01:36:12,140
to get away from all the corruption.

2016
01:36:12,140 --> 01:36:13,780
It doesn't mean we didn't repeat it here again,

2017
01:36:13,780 --> 01:36:15,380
but it was fresh and it was new.

2018
01:36:16,580 --> 01:36:18,340
And I, for one, am just sick of it.

2019
01:36:19,260 --> 01:36:20,860
I'm tired of it.

2020
01:36:20,860 --> 01:36:23,860
And I know authoritarians, they're deceptive.

2021
01:36:23,860 --> 01:36:26,700
They sit there manipulating their audience going,

2022
01:36:26,700 --> 01:36:29,620
Mr. Jones, we don't want your firearms.

2023
01:36:29,620 --> 01:36:31,580
We want reasonable restrictions

2024
01:36:31,580 --> 01:36:35,500
on these black guns that are so scary.

2025
01:36:35,500 --> 01:36:38,900
I'm like, the bill says you can take whatever guns you want.

2026
01:36:38,900 --> 01:36:40,060
That's the positive.

2027
01:36:41,500 --> 01:36:44,060
Hoping his audience doesn't go look it up.

2028
01:36:45,420 --> 01:36:46,700
I mean, let me tell you something, folks.

2029
01:36:46,700 --> 01:36:48,860
I am the most loving guy around.

2030
01:36:48,860 --> 01:36:51,980
That's why I'm so angry and aggressive.

2031
01:36:51,980 --> 01:36:52,820
Because,

2032
01:36:56,140 --> 01:36:58,140
well, what did Barry Goldwater say?

2033
01:36:58,140 --> 01:37:02,580
He said, extremism in defense of liberty is no vice.

2034
01:37:02,580 --> 01:37:07,580
And he said, silence isn't golden, it's yellow.

2035
01:37:10,620 --> 01:37:11,460
And that's true.

2036
01:37:14,260 --> 01:37:17,260
But I can say right now, I've lived a life that's been real.

2037
01:37:18,380 --> 01:37:21,220
And I've influenced others to live a life that's real.

2038
01:37:21,220 --> 01:37:23,140
And I shook the hands of people in New York

2039
01:37:23,140 --> 01:37:26,580
and New Jersey and on the plane in Austin, Texas,

2040
01:37:26,580 --> 01:37:29,620
scientists and professors and engineers

2041
01:37:29,620 --> 01:37:32,260
and school teachers and police officers

2042
01:37:32,260 --> 01:37:35,140
who do know the truth and they have that light in their eyes.

2043
01:37:35,140 --> 01:37:36,100
They were awake.

2044
01:37:36,100 --> 01:37:39,220
I talked to one of our listeners, man, that's a real person.

2045
01:37:39,220 --> 01:37:41,780
They're bearing, they have a jovial,

2046
01:37:41,780 --> 01:37:44,260
gregarious smile in their eyes.

2047
01:37:44,260 --> 01:37:45,860
And they're sweet, but you could tell

2048
01:37:45,860 --> 01:37:47,460
they'll pull your arm out of your socket.

2049
01:37:47,460 --> 01:37:48,740
It's the same thing.

2050
01:37:48,740 --> 01:37:53,540
And it's time for those of us that aren't evil inherently.

2051
01:37:53,540 --> 01:37:56,140
We're all bad at one level or another, but our hearts are good.

2052
01:37:56,140 --> 01:37:58,300
We love God, we love goodness, we love children.

2053
01:37:58,300 --> 01:38:00,780
We love fair play, we love decency.

2054
01:38:00,780 --> 01:38:03,180
We like cooking dinner for people.

2055
01:38:03,180 --> 01:38:04,860
You know, we like taking care of folks.

2056
01:38:04,860 --> 01:38:06,780
We like just goodness.

2057
01:38:06,780 --> 01:38:08,700
We don't like these robotic cold people

2058
01:38:08,700 --> 01:38:10,860
that always want power and to get control of us

2059
01:38:10,860 --> 01:38:11,740
and feed off of us.

2060
01:38:11,740 --> 01:38:13,140
I'm done being a slave.

2061
01:38:13,140 --> 01:38:14,900
I'm tired of it.

2062
01:38:14,900 --> 01:38:16,020
I'm tired of it.

2063
01:38:18,580 --> 01:38:20,220
I said I'd go to these clubs and then your calls.

2064
01:38:20,220 --> 01:38:23,380
We got John, Mike, Aaron, Andrew, Robert, Ron

2065
01:38:23,380 --> 01:38:24,740
and many, many others.

2066
01:38:24,740 --> 01:38:25,580
I wanna talk to Ron.

2067
01:38:25,580 --> 01:38:28,900
He's been calling us for about 13 years, it's about 99.

2068
01:38:28,900 --> 01:38:31,140
And he sent us a lot of good info over the years.

2069
01:38:31,140 --> 01:38:32,700
He's a retired New York police officer.

2070
01:38:32,700 --> 01:38:33,540
I'll just leave it at that.

2071
01:38:33,540 --> 01:38:35,900
But I wanna get his take on these guys.

2072
01:38:35,900 --> 01:38:37,140
I mean, they acted like cops,

2073
01:38:37,140 --> 01:38:39,500
but they look like stuff out of Goodfellas.

2074
01:38:39,500 --> 01:38:42,700
I just couldn't believe it, it was all over us.

2075
01:38:42,700 --> 01:38:43,900
And it's trying to intimidate.

2076
01:38:43,900 --> 01:38:45,660
It's like, come on, man, you don't intimidate me.

2077
01:38:45,660 --> 01:38:49,860
I'm scared of what I'm gonna do because, man,

2078
01:38:49,860 --> 01:38:51,780
I mean, I'll turn into King Kong on people.

2079
01:38:51,780 --> 01:38:53,660
And it's not because I'm looking for trouble.

2080
01:38:53,660 --> 01:38:55,780
I'm cornered here, man.

2081
01:38:55,780 --> 01:38:58,060
I'm not wanting to fly to New York

2082
01:38:58,060 --> 01:38:59,940
and get in the face of Piers Morgan.

2083
01:38:59,940 --> 01:39:03,300
This isn't about me being Mr. Fancy Pants.

2084
01:39:03,300 --> 01:39:06,740
It's about survival of freedom in our children's future.

2085
01:39:11,740 --> 01:39:15,860
800-259-9231, you hear a caller hang up,

2086
01:39:15,860 --> 01:39:16,700
we'll go to the next person.

2087
01:39:16,700 --> 01:39:17,780
Let's play Piers.

2088
01:39:17,780 --> 01:39:19,820
This morning, he's all over CNN,

2089
01:39:19,820 --> 01:39:22,220
playing the part of a victim.

2090
01:39:22,220 --> 01:39:23,620
And, oh my gosh, Piers,

2091
01:39:23,620 --> 01:39:24,940
I guess he didn't answer your question

2092
01:39:24,940 --> 01:39:26,300
why didn't you deport him?

2093
01:39:26,300 --> 01:39:28,300
I said, because all these foreign governments

2094
01:39:28,300 --> 01:39:30,140
and foreigners are telling us what to do,

2095
01:39:30,140 --> 01:39:31,860
it's not your country.

2096
01:39:31,860 --> 01:39:33,780
And Mao Tse Tung said political power

2097
01:39:33,780 --> 01:39:35,020
goes out of the barrel of the gun.

2098
01:39:35,020 --> 01:39:36,660
He had the guns, the people didn't,

2099
01:39:36,660 --> 01:39:38,500
and he killed over 70 million people.

2100
01:39:38,500 --> 01:39:40,580
Do you understand that, you witch?

2101
01:39:41,780 --> 01:39:44,700
Your whole life is about being status-driven

2102
01:39:44,700 --> 01:39:47,060
and sitting up there with a painted face

2103
01:39:47,060 --> 01:39:48,860
in a newsroom like you're somebody

2104
01:39:48,860 --> 01:39:50,340
reading off a teleprompter.

2105
01:39:51,660 --> 01:39:53,700
You know when you're somebody is when you realize

2106
01:39:53,700 --> 01:39:55,780
it doesn't matter whether you're somebody.

2107
01:39:55,780 --> 01:39:57,860
And that stuff stops mattering.

2108
01:39:57,860 --> 01:40:03,500
And what matters is having a garden,

2109
01:40:03,500 --> 01:40:05,300
helping an old lady across the street,

2110
01:40:05,300 --> 01:40:08,180
painting, taking care of people that are weak,

2111
01:40:08,180 --> 01:40:10,340
being a good person and stomping bullies.

2112
01:40:15,380 --> 01:40:16,340
And again, folks,

2113
01:40:16,340 --> 01:40:18,500
is there something about a bully?

2114
01:40:18,500 --> 01:40:20,900
These guys you see where the worst suits

2115
01:40:20,900 --> 01:40:22,660
and like standing around like they're security guys

2116
01:40:22,660 --> 01:40:24,820
and bug their eyes out of people all day,

2117
01:40:24,820 --> 01:40:27,020
like they need to intimidate people and feel powerful.

2118
01:40:27,020 --> 01:40:29,540
I mean, it just drives me into a rage

2119
01:40:29,540 --> 01:40:30,980
because at a primitive level,

2120
01:40:32,060 --> 01:40:34,260
you see men who are calm

2121
01:40:34,260 --> 01:40:39,100
and aren't on power trips, but are reserved,

2122
01:40:39,100 --> 01:40:40,980
but you know right underneath the surface

2123
01:40:40,980 --> 01:40:42,020
that these are strong people.

2124
01:40:42,020 --> 01:40:46,020
They would never act like all of these goons

2125
01:40:46,020 --> 01:40:47,940
and just all these folks.

2126
01:40:47,940 --> 01:40:49,940
And see, some people think I come off like a goon.

2127
01:40:49,940 --> 01:40:50,780
It's the opposite.

2128
01:40:50,780 --> 01:40:55,500
I'm just a wild hillbilly who will not be a slave.

2129
01:40:55,500 --> 01:40:56,340
It's real simple.

2130
01:40:56,340 --> 01:40:59,780
And the goons are trying to act like a wild man.

2131
01:40:59,780 --> 01:41:02,140
They're having to charge themselves up all day

2132
01:41:02,140 --> 01:41:03,620
to be this tough guy.

2133
01:41:05,140 --> 01:41:08,860
And if they ever really woke up and became liberty lovers,

2134
01:41:08,860 --> 01:41:11,980
they could join the human family.

2135
01:41:11,980 --> 01:41:13,100
But we're not going anywhere

2136
01:41:13,100 --> 01:41:15,140
letting a bunch of dirt bags run our lives.

2137
01:41:15,140 --> 01:41:17,220
And anybody that bows down to a bully

2138
01:41:17,220 --> 01:41:18,900
greases the skins of slavery.

2139
01:41:18,900 --> 01:41:22,580
The path to stepping and fetching and groveling

2140
01:41:22,580 --> 01:41:24,660
to the system leads to hell on earth.

2141
01:41:24,660 --> 01:41:26,700
And we need to rediscover our distrust

2142
01:41:26,700 --> 01:41:27,780
and dislike of government.

2143
01:41:30,500 --> 01:41:32,780
Our forebears, if you talked about taking liberties,

2144
01:41:32,780 --> 01:41:34,660
they'd take you and pour hot tar over you

2145
01:41:34,660 --> 01:41:35,780
that normally killed you.

2146
01:41:37,380 --> 01:41:38,780
They'd tar and feather you.

2147
01:41:38,780 --> 01:41:40,020
I'm not even saying that's a good thing.

2148
01:41:41,540 --> 01:41:44,020
The point is, is that now we've gotten so domesticated

2149
01:41:44,020 --> 01:41:49,020
and in such a trance that how dare, how dare anybody

2150
01:41:53,500 --> 01:41:56,460
even raise their voice to a congenital,

2151
01:41:56,460 --> 01:42:00,260
proven fraudster liar like Piers Morgan.

2152
01:42:00,260 --> 01:42:02,620
And I told him, I haven't even told this story yet.

2153
01:42:03,460 --> 01:42:06,100
I don't even know if I can support it.

2154
01:42:06,100 --> 01:42:06,940
At the end of it, he said,

2155
01:42:06,940 --> 01:42:08,100
nope, that's where I'll do the next segment.

2156
01:42:08,100 --> 01:42:08,940
I said, oh, you're checking down?

2157
01:42:08,940 --> 01:42:09,900
He goes, yeah.

2158
01:42:09,900 --> 01:42:11,340
I said, we will defeat your tyranny.

2159
01:42:11,340 --> 01:42:14,100
And he laughed at me like, you think you will?

2160
01:42:14,100 --> 01:42:15,860
The first time I saw any life out of him,

2161
01:42:15,860 --> 01:42:17,820
I said, you're nothing but a gangster

2162
01:42:17,820 --> 01:42:21,180
that's been run to ground here in the United States.

2163
01:42:22,100 --> 01:42:23,860
And pretty soon, nobody's gonna want you

2164
01:42:23,860 --> 01:42:25,660
anywhere in the world, you're scum.

2165
01:42:27,060 --> 01:42:29,020
His face just started twitching like this.

2166
01:42:29,020 --> 01:42:31,140
He was like a plastic person.

2167
01:42:31,140 --> 01:42:33,060
I don't think the elite are really reptoids,

2168
01:42:33,060 --> 01:42:34,380
like some people think, but that's fine.

2169
01:42:34,380 --> 01:42:35,220
That's their view.

2170
01:42:35,220 --> 01:42:36,060
But it was almost like he was gonna

2171
01:42:36,060 --> 01:42:37,460
pull a plastic mass off him.

2172
01:42:38,500 --> 01:42:40,180
And he just looked emaciated.

2173
01:42:40,180 --> 01:42:41,780
And they're like wraiths.

2174
01:42:41,780 --> 01:42:44,860
All these globalists, you see them, they're like, ugh.

2175
01:42:44,860 --> 01:42:46,340
They're weak.

2176
01:42:46,340 --> 01:42:47,540
They're so weak.

2177
01:42:47,540 --> 01:42:49,340
And I'm tired of them running us.

2178
01:42:50,660 --> 01:42:52,220
Let's go to a clip, then I'll go to your calls.

2179
01:42:52,220 --> 01:42:54,140
Here's a clip of him this morning.

2180
01:42:54,140 --> 01:42:55,020
We got so many of these.

2181
01:42:55,020 --> 01:42:56,180
I haven't even played one.

2182
01:42:56,180 --> 01:42:57,460
Hour and 42 minutes into it.

2183
01:42:57,460 --> 01:42:58,300
Here it is.

2184
01:42:59,620 --> 01:43:00,460
Here's that-

2185
01:43:00,460 --> 01:43:01,980
And I'm curious as to what you think

2186
01:43:01,980 --> 01:43:05,100
the takeaway is for everyone who is watching.

2187
01:43:06,540 --> 01:43:07,540
Well, honestly, I mean,

2188
01:43:07,540 --> 01:43:09,900
he's now trending worldwide on Twitter

2189
01:43:09,900 --> 01:43:13,420
and has been pretty much since the show went out.

2190
01:43:13,420 --> 01:43:16,660
And I can't think of a better advertisement

2191
01:43:16,660 --> 01:43:19,820
for gun control than Alex Jones's interview last night.

2192
01:43:19,820 --> 01:43:21,660
It was startling.

2193
01:43:21,660 --> 01:43:24,500
It was terrifying in parts.

2194
01:43:24,500 --> 01:43:26,260
It was completely deluded.

2195
01:43:26,260 --> 01:43:31,260
It was based on a premise of making Americans so fearful

2196
01:43:31,540 --> 01:43:34,340
that they all rushed out to buy even more guns.

2197
01:43:34,340 --> 01:43:36,620
It showed no compassion whatsoever

2198
01:43:36,620 --> 01:43:39,420
to the victims of gun shootings.

2199
01:43:39,420 --> 01:43:43,300
And the kind of twisted way

2200
01:43:43,300 --> 01:43:45,940
that he turned everything into this assault

2201
01:43:45,940 --> 01:43:47,260
on the Second Amendment

2202
01:43:47,260 --> 01:43:50,340
is exactly what the gun rights lobby people do.

2203
01:43:50,340 --> 01:43:52,220
And it's a lie.

2204
01:43:52,220 --> 01:43:53,060
It cannot be-

2205
01:43:53,060 --> 01:43:53,900
Turn it off.

2206
01:43:54,780 --> 01:43:56,100
I'm a liar.

2207
01:43:56,100 --> 01:43:57,660
Dianne Feinstein hasn't said

2208
01:43:57,660 --> 01:44:00,300
she wants the total abolition of our guns.

2209
01:44:00,300 --> 01:44:01,540
Sarah Brady, all of them.

2210
01:44:01,540 --> 01:44:03,100
I mean, it's just,

2211
01:44:03,100 --> 01:44:05,580
how long do we have to put up with these liars,

2212
01:44:05,580 --> 01:44:10,020
calling us liars?

2213
01:44:10,020 --> 01:44:11,460
And then Dershowitz saying

2214
01:44:11,460 --> 01:44:13,980
the Second Amendment means he doesn't get a gun.

2215
01:44:13,980 --> 01:44:15,020
We're gonna play that clip.

2216
01:44:15,020 --> 01:44:16,060
There's a bunch of other clips.

2217
01:44:16,060 --> 01:44:17,100
I mean, it's just,

2218
01:44:18,340 --> 01:44:20,020
the fact that they've dumbed people down

2219
01:44:20,020 --> 01:44:22,260
and gotten them so ignorant is the only way,

2220
01:44:22,260 --> 01:44:25,500
it's like amoebas can only live like infected hot water,

2221
01:44:25,500 --> 01:44:26,700
sewage water.

2222
01:44:26,700 --> 01:44:28,340
And they turned America into a sewage

2223
01:44:28,340 --> 01:44:30,100
so they could live here.

2224
01:44:30,100 --> 01:44:30,940
He's globalist.

2225
01:44:30,940 --> 01:44:33,580
I mean, you people are sewage.

2226
01:44:33,580 --> 01:44:37,420
Well, sewage can bring life to the fields.

2227
01:44:37,420 --> 01:44:39,260
That's better than you.

2228
01:44:40,460 --> 01:44:42,100
You're parasites.

2229
01:44:42,100 --> 01:44:43,060
You're the worst kind.

2230
01:44:43,060 --> 01:44:45,740
And I just can't stand it.

2231
01:44:48,180 --> 01:44:50,500
And then he doesn't know what to do

2232
01:44:50,500 --> 01:44:53,420
now that we were the number one trend yesterday and today

2233
01:44:53,420 --> 01:44:54,420
on Twitter worldwide.

2234
01:44:54,420 --> 01:44:56,140
Real Alex Jones, you wanna follow us?

2235
01:44:56,140 --> 01:44:57,380
I don't even really promote Twitter

2236
01:44:57,380 --> 01:44:59,460
except the last few months trying to build it up.

2237
01:44:59,460 --> 01:45:00,580
I mean, it totally freaks him out.

2238
01:45:00,580 --> 01:45:01,820
In fact, I haven't even been Twittering.

2239
01:45:01,820 --> 01:45:03,500
Guys, when my phone broke,

2240
01:45:05,180 --> 01:45:06,820
and then you guys put it on an older phone,

2241
01:45:06,820 --> 01:45:08,100
Twitter isn't set up on that.

2242
01:45:08,100 --> 01:45:09,620
Can you go right now?

2243
01:45:09,620 --> 01:45:10,900
As I've had some of the crew tweeting

2244
01:45:10,900 --> 01:45:11,780
and they do a great job,

2245
01:45:11,780 --> 01:45:13,260
but sometimes it's not really my words.

2246
01:45:13,260 --> 01:45:15,140
They try to take my words off the air and put it on.

2247
01:45:15,140 --> 01:45:15,980
They do a great job,

2248
01:45:15,980 --> 01:45:18,900
but can you get me the tweetie tweet back on there

2249
01:45:18,900 --> 01:45:20,620
so I can send tweetie tweets?

2250
01:45:20,620 --> 01:45:21,460
Thank you.

2251
01:45:23,620 --> 01:45:25,060
I like tweeting,

2252
01:45:25,060 --> 01:45:28,380
because I can sit there at like 2 a.m.,

2253
01:45:28,380 --> 01:45:29,940
come up and send something out.

2254
01:45:29,940 --> 01:45:30,780
Oh.

2255
01:45:35,900 --> 01:45:37,780
We got Dershowitz queued up.

2256
01:45:37,780 --> 01:45:38,860
Let's just go to your phone calls.

2257
01:45:38,860 --> 01:45:40,220
I'll get to Dershowitz.

2258
01:45:40,220 --> 01:45:41,580
Who's up first?

2259
01:45:41,580 --> 01:45:45,660
Let's go to Ron in New York,

2260
01:45:46,580 --> 01:45:48,220
retired police officer.

2261
01:45:48,220 --> 01:45:49,460
What is your take on what happened

2262
01:45:49,460 --> 01:45:50,500
and what is your take on the men

2263
01:45:50,500 --> 01:45:52,940
that were following me all day yesterday?

2264
01:45:52,940 --> 01:45:54,100
Well, hello, Alex.

2265
01:45:54,100 --> 01:45:55,500
I'd like to congratulate you

2266
01:45:55,500 --> 01:45:57,860
on finally doing to Piers Morgan

2267
01:45:57,860 --> 01:45:59,100
what Piers Morgan has done

2268
01:45:59,100 --> 01:46:02,020
to continual guests one after the other

2269
01:46:02,020 --> 01:46:03,540
over the last several weeks.

2270
01:46:03,540 --> 01:46:04,900
He did it to Larry Pratt.

2271
01:46:04,900 --> 01:46:06,180
He did it to John Lott.

2272
01:46:06,180 --> 01:46:07,740
He did it to representative

2273
01:46:07,740 --> 01:46:10,940
from a Second Amendment organization in Michigan.

2274
01:46:10,940 --> 01:46:11,780
He was rude.

2275
01:46:11,780 --> 01:46:12,660
He was truculent.

2276
01:46:12,660 --> 01:46:13,980
He was vociferous.

2277
01:46:13,980 --> 01:46:15,060
He name called.

2278
01:46:15,060 --> 01:46:17,460
He became aggressive towards them.

2279
01:46:17,460 --> 01:46:18,860
And then finally last night,

2280
01:46:18,860 --> 01:46:19,900
he gets it back.

2281
01:46:19,900 --> 01:46:23,060
He gets back only what he has done time and again,

2282
01:46:23,060 --> 01:46:25,300
and then he acts like he's a whip pup,

2283
01:46:25,300 --> 01:46:27,980
and he brings in two of the Kennedy clan to sit there

2284
01:46:27,980 --> 01:46:30,700
while he stands here like he's just a poor beaten grandmother

2285
01:46:30,700 --> 01:46:31,620
or something.

2286
01:46:31,620 --> 01:46:34,860
This guy is this phony is a $3 bill

2287
01:46:34,860 --> 01:46:37,420
and his theatrics go back to the Victorian era.

2288
01:46:37,420 --> 01:46:38,980
They're not very sophisticated.

2289
01:46:38,980 --> 01:46:41,540
Who are these guys that were following me all day?

2290
01:46:42,380 --> 01:46:44,300
Well, they could have been people involved

2291
01:46:44,300 --> 01:46:46,620
with the PD or CNN security.

2292
01:46:46,620 --> 01:46:48,660
I had a similar thing like that happen once.

2293
01:46:48,660 --> 01:46:50,140
I told you about it some years ago

2294
01:46:50,140 --> 01:46:52,820
when I was in a Barnes and Noble's bookstore

2295
01:46:52,820 --> 01:46:54,780
talking with two Saudi Arabians

2296
01:46:54,780 --> 01:46:57,500
about the 9-11 incident at that time.

2297
01:46:57,500 --> 01:46:58,620
You'll just see these people.

2298
01:46:58,620 --> 01:47:00,780
In that case, they came out of bookshelves

2299
01:47:00,780 --> 01:47:01,860
with black suits on,

2300
01:47:01,860 --> 01:47:03,940
and they were talking into their lapels.

2301
01:47:03,940 --> 01:47:05,180
What the hell with those people?

2302
01:47:05,180 --> 01:47:06,980
Plain and simple, don't be afraid of them.

2303
01:47:06,980 --> 01:47:07,820
They really should do it.

2304
01:47:07,820 --> 01:47:09,860
No, I mean, I was afraid of what they laid their hand.

2305
01:47:09,860 --> 01:47:11,220
I mean, I'm not just saying that.

2306
01:47:11,220 --> 01:47:12,220
I mean, that's like, man,

2307
01:47:12,220 --> 01:47:14,660
you guys are like really asking for it.

2308
01:47:14,660 --> 01:47:18,060
So long as you do what you know you have to do

2309
01:47:18,060 --> 01:47:18,900
and what's right.

2310
01:47:18,900 --> 01:47:21,660
Believe me, they're just a little dog with a big bark.

2311
01:47:21,660 --> 01:47:23,300
That's how I handled that then.

2312
01:47:23,300 --> 01:47:24,540
And that's obviously,

2313
01:47:24,540 --> 01:47:26,580
it seems that's how you handled that yesterday.

2314
01:47:26,580 --> 01:47:29,420
But it could be because Piers Morgan has the connections

2315
01:47:29,420 --> 01:47:30,660
with the mayor of the city.

2316
01:47:30,660 --> 01:47:31,500
They're close.

2317
01:47:31,500 --> 01:47:32,340
He's interviewed him.

2318
01:47:32,340 --> 01:47:35,380
The White House responded before the show was over.

2319
01:47:35,380 --> 01:47:36,220
Right, right.

2320
01:47:36,220 --> 01:47:37,740
Another thing that happened is, right,

2321
01:47:37,740 --> 01:47:39,460
he got the White House to respond to that

2322
01:47:39,460 --> 01:47:40,780
before the show was over.

2323
01:47:40,780 --> 01:47:43,180
So he would have the connections enough to make a call

2324
01:47:43,180 --> 01:47:45,780
and ask somebody to, I guess, harass you.

2325
01:47:45,780 --> 01:47:47,020
Yes, and that does happen.

2326
01:47:47,020 --> 01:47:49,260
I mean, without changing the subject,

2327
01:47:49,260 --> 01:47:52,220
the mayor of the city went into a strange arrangement

2328
01:47:52,220 --> 01:47:55,180
with a newspaper publisher here named Mortimer Zuckerman,

2329
01:47:55,180 --> 01:47:56,980
which if you like to at some time,

2330
01:47:56,980 --> 01:47:59,340
I'd be glad to go into at length with you.

2331
01:47:59,340 --> 01:48:01,900
But the bottom line is that type of networking occurs

2332
01:48:01,900 --> 01:48:05,580
amongst these type of lower forms of life.

2333
01:48:05,580 --> 01:48:10,340
But it's ironic after all Piers Morgan has done to savage,

2334
01:48:10,340 --> 01:48:12,540
savage his pro-Second Amendment guests

2335
01:48:12,540 --> 01:48:14,860
over the last almost month or so,

2336
01:48:14,860 --> 01:48:18,300
he then gets back the same treatment he dished out

2337
01:48:18,300 --> 01:48:19,300
and he's crying.

2338
01:48:19,300 --> 01:48:21,780
He's crying all over the place like a child.

2339
01:48:21,780 --> 01:48:24,940
No, no, every time I walk back there by the coffee area

2340
01:48:24,940 --> 01:48:28,020
to get water or whatever, he's on the news.

2341
01:48:28,020 --> 01:48:30,580
I mean, CNN, like half their coverage right now

2342
01:48:30,580 --> 01:48:33,900
is big mean Alex Jones came and called me a red coat.

2343
01:48:33,900 --> 01:48:36,140
And then they've got fake conservatives out there,

2344
01:48:36,140 --> 01:48:38,260
it's a minority, sucking their thumbs going,

2345
01:48:38,260 --> 01:48:40,360
we ought to be nicey nice.

2346
01:48:40,360 --> 01:48:42,500
No, the time for being nice is over.

2347
01:48:42,500 --> 01:48:46,420
They want us to physically turn in all our semi-autos.

2348
01:48:46,420 --> 01:48:50,460
They tried to outright ban 90% of guns literally in Illinois.

2349
01:48:50,460 --> 01:48:52,820
Folks, quit playing games.

2350
01:48:52,820 --> 01:48:55,940
You're getting run over because you act like slaves.

2351
01:48:55,940 --> 01:48:58,460
Free men don't act like little cowards.

2352
01:48:58,460 --> 01:49:02,140
And I'm not up here getting mad like I'm Mr. Tough Guy,

2353
01:49:02,140 --> 01:49:04,140
folks, but look at me, look at the fruits.

2354
01:49:04,140 --> 01:49:05,860
I'm marching around everywhere,

2355
01:49:05,860 --> 01:49:08,140
storm capital, storm Bohemian Grove,

2356
01:49:08,140 --> 01:49:10,140
storm this, storm that.

2357
01:49:10,140 --> 01:49:12,180
Jump off a cliff two years ago, Bohemian Grove,

2358
01:49:12,180 --> 01:49:13,820
everybody else gets arrested.

2359
01:49:13,820 --> 01:49:16,340
Constantly fighting these people, going to Bilderberg,

2360
01:49:16,340 --> 01:49:18,280
fighting, fighting, fighting.

2361
01:49:18,280 --> 01:49:20,700
And all I gotta say is anybody that's armchair quarterback

2362
01:49:20,700 --> 01:49:22,620
and good, let's see what you can do.

2363
01:49:22,620 --> 01:49:24,420
Get up there, I need your help.

2364
01:49:24,420 --> 01:49:26,180
What do you say to that, Ron?

2365
01:49:26,180 --> 01:49:27,860
I say that's what needs to be done.

2366
01:49:27,860 --> 01:49:29,700
And I say, what about what Piers Morgan

2367
01:49:29,700 --> 01:49:31,940
done to his guests over the last month?

2368
01:49:31,940 --> 01:49:33,140
How come no one says anything

2369
01:49:33,140 --> 01:49:34,900
about his mistreatment of guests?

2370
01:49:34,900 --> 01:49:38,020
And somebody else who has a big brass.

2371
01:49:38,020 --> 01:49:40,820
Alan Dershowitz is a man who facilitated

2372
01:49:40,820 --> 01:49:42,740
more criminals and murderers in this country

2373
01:49:42,740 --> 01:49:44,300
than you could shake a stick at.

2374
01:49:44,300 --> 01:49:46,580
I guess it wasn't an issue of the Second Amendment

2375
01:49:46,580 --> 01:49:49,620
when he assisted the Melendez brothers in their case

2376
01:49:49,620 --> 01:49:52,060
when they blew their parents' brains out in their sleep

2377
01:49:52,060 --> 01:49:53,260
to get their money.

2378
01:49:53,260 --> 01:49:54,820
But that was okay, though.

2379
01:49:54,820 --> 01:49:58,820
No, no, I mean, he is a ultra-slimy dirtbag lawyer

2380
01:49:58,820 --> 01:50:00,300
who gets up there and everyone goes,

2381
01:50:00,300 --> 01:50:03,220
oh, Dershowitz is here.

2382
01:50:03,220 --> 01:50:04,620
Yes, torture is quite legal.

2383
01:50:04,620 --> 01:50:06,620
We should torture anybody we want whenever.

2384
01:50:06,620 --> 01:50:09,140
And yes, we should be able to have,

2385
01:50:09,140 --> 01:50:12,580
the guy is an authoritarian dirtbag.

2386
01:50:12,580 --> 01:50:14,100
Dirtbag hypocrite.

2387
01:50:14,100 --> 01:50:16,300
And you know what gets me about these guys?

2388
01:50:16,300 --> 01:50:19,580
I would have, not respect, but some consideration of them

2389
01:50:19,580 --> 01:50:22,420
if their lies was clever and intelligent.

2390
01:50:22,420 --> 01:50:24,380
Piers Morgan last night, you said to him,

2391
01:50:24,380 --> 01:50:26,380
you mentioned the London riots, which are known.

2392
01:50:26,380 --> 01:50:29,100
They're as well known as World War II or World War I.

2393
01:50:29,100 --> 01:50:31,500
The riots that occurred in the city of London last year.

2394
01:50:31,500 --> 01:50:33,380
And he said to you, you could review the tape

2395
01:50:33,380 --> 01:50:34,420
if you didn't catch it.

2396
01:50:34,420 --> 01:50:35,580
He says, that's a lie.

2397
01:50:35,580 --> 01:50:37,340
Fuck it, it didn't happen, that's a lie.

2398
01:50:37,340 --> 01:50:39,660
You gotta be kidding, the whole world witnessed those riots.

2399
01:50:39,660 --> 01:50:40,820
That's the game they play.

2400
01:50:40,820 --> 01:50:42,300
They go, we don't want your guns.

2401
01:50:42,300 --> 01:50:43,660
I'm like, here's the bill.

2402
01:50:43,660 --> 01:50:45,540
No, no, he's lying.

2403
01:50:45,540 --> 01:50:48,220
And I gotta tell you, the only people I heard from

2404
01:50:48,220 --> 01:50:49,860
who didn't like it were women.

2405
01:50:49,860 --> 01:50:51,500
They're like, you should have been nicer.

2406
01:50:51,500 --> 01:50:54,260
Because they get little teacups of the queen and stuff.

2407
01:50:54,260 --> 01:50:55,660
They think it's cutesy.

2408
01:50:55,660 --> 01:50:58,580
The queen is a worldwide crime syndicate boss.

2409
01:51:00,660 --> 01:51:02,060
Hello, I'm Alex Jones.

2410
01:51:02,060 --> 01:51:05,380
Myself, my family, the Infowars.com team

2411
01:51:05,380 --> 01:51:08,180
want to relay to you and your families

2412
01:51:08,180 --> 01:51:10,540
that we are intensifying our efforts

2413
01:51:10,540 --> 01:51:12,700
against the globalist on every front.

2414
01:51:12,700 --> 01:51:17,220
Infowars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats.

2415
01:51:17,220 --> 01:51:19,980
But we can't do that without your help.

2416
01:51:19,980 --> 01:51:22,180
By getting the films, bumper stickers,

2417
01:51:22,180 --> 01:51:24,540
and t-shirts at Infowars.com,

2418
01:51:24,540 --> 01:51:26,700
you will wake up people in your area

2419
01:51:26,700 --> 01:51:31,220
and support our operation as we move to the next level.

2420
01:51:31,220 --> 01:51:34,740
We need your help to spread the word like never before.

2421
01:51:34,740 --> 01:51:38,100
They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle

2422
01:51:38,100 --> 01:51:40,860
between the forces of freedom and darkness.

2423
01:51:40,860 --> 01:51:44,740
You are the response to the globalist technocrats

2424
01:51:44,740 --> 01:51:48,460
and their program of global eugenics dehumanization

2425
01:51:48,460 --> 01:51:50,740
and ultimate extermination.

2426
01:51:50,740 --> 01:51:52,140
The war is here.

2427
01:51:52,140 --> 01:51:54,140
It's an info war.

2428
01:51:54,140 --> 01:51:59,140
The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.

2429
01:52:00,900 --> 01:52:02,220
Food storage, check.

2430
01:52:02,220 --> 01:52:03,780
Survival tools, check.

2431
01:52:03,780 --> 01:52:05,780
Weapons and water filters, check.

2432
01:52:05,780 --> 01:52:08,240
But what about a permanent source of cooking power

2433
01:52:08,240 --> 01:52:10,620
that can run forever without buying fuel

2434
01:52:10,620 --> 01:52:11,860
or paying for maintenance?

01:52:11,860 --> 01:52:13,660

and I know what the good Lord wants.

2479
01:54:28,740 --> 01:54:31,380
Look at this, member of Biden's gun control task force

2480
01:54:31,380 --> 01:54:35,420
has a son convicted of planning a school mass murder.

2481
01:54:35,420 --> 01:54:36,620
Well, you got to hire folks

2482
01:54:36,620 --> 01:54:39,220
that know how to get the job done, don't you?

2483
01:54:39,220 --> 01:54:41,340
Oh, they'd staged fast and furious

2484
01:54:41,340 --> 01:54:43,780
and our government, foreign government

2485
01:54:43,780 --> 01:54:45,420
has staged mass shootings in Europe,

2486
01:54:45,420 --> 01:54:47,660
Operation Gladio that I got out on the show.

2487
01:54:49,340 --> 01:54:50,820
And by the way, I saw some of the people

2488
01:54:50,820 --> 01:54:52,940
in the audience there, some of the Texan people,

2489
01:54:52,940 --> 01:54:54,060
they were freaking out.

2490
01:54:54,060 --> 01:54:55,220
They knew what all that was.

2491
01:54:55,220 --> 01:54:57,360
I mean, that was, they got a good crew of scum

2492
01:54:57,360 --> 01:54:58,840
over there at CNN.

2493
01:54:58,840 --> 01:55:00,820
Members of Biden's gun control task force

2494
01:55:00,820 --> 01:55:04,280
has a son convicted of planning mass school mass murder.

2495
01:55:04,280 --> 01:55:07,700
Hmm, isn't that just special?

2496
01:55:07,700 --> 01:55:09,380
Isn't that just, isn't that just,

2497
01:55:09,380 --> 01:55:11,520
isn't that just special?

2498
01:55:12,620 --> 01:55:16,340
Very, but I mean, Department of Defense through DARPA

2499
01:55:16,340 --> 01:55:18,380
gave a grant to the Batman shooter

2500
01:55:18,380 --> 01:55:19,820
and he was on drugs like we said,

2501
01:55:19,820 --> 01:55:21,020
they now confirm today.

2502
01:55:21,020 --> 01:55:22,340
World and Daily Drudge Report,

2503
01:55:22,340 --> 01:55:24,700
it's 60 minutes confirms it.

2504
01:55:24,700 --> 01:55:26,240
Bunch of different articles.

2505
01:55:26,240 --> 01:55:27,080
That's no big deal.

2506
01:55:27,080 --> 01:55:28,220
You know, we were right about that again.

2507
01:55:28,220 --> 01:55:29,460
It'll come out later about this guy

2508
01:55:29,460 --> 01:55:30,580
before they've milked it.

2509
01:55:31,460 --> 01:55:33,680
They're probably gonna blow up some federal buildings

2510
01:55:33,680 --> 01:55:36,500
the way they're acting or they're thinking about it.

2511
01:55:36,500 --> 01:55:38,260
They're so stupid, I don't wanna give them my ideas.

2512
01:55:38,260 --> 01:55:40,740
And then, you know, 1776 will commence again

2513
01:55:40,740 --> 01:55:42,340
if you try to take our firearms.

2514
01:55:42,340 --> 01:55:43,840
Imply I'm behind it.

2515
01:55:45,020 --> 01:55:47,780
I mean, let me tell you, they're like cornered rodents.

2516
01:55:47,780 --> 01:55:48,620
Let's go to your calls.

2517
01:55:48,620 --> 01:55:51,060
I'm gonna try to go quicker now to Aaron

2518
01:55:51,060 --> 01:55:53,660
and many others, John and others.

2519
01:55:53,660 --> 01:55:55,840
Aaron, listening or watched

2520
01:55:55,840 --> 01:55:58,100
the Communist News Network last night.

2521
01:55:58,100 --> 01:56:00,980
Go ahead, Aaron, you're on the air from Washington.

2522
01:56:00,980 --> 01:56:04,180
Hello, yeah, you know, every day I noticed

2523
01:56:04,180 --> 01:56:06,420
how the mainstream media is just getting

2524
01:56:06,420 --> 01:56:09,500
more and more cartoonish with its propaganda.

2525
01:56:09,500 --> 01:56:13,020
These big media corporations for decades

2526
01:56:13,020 --> 01:56:16,380
have been experimenting with perception management.

2527
01:56:16,380 --> 01:56:20,540
I mean, CBS back in the 30s, they aired War of the Worlds.

2528
01:56:20,540 --> 01:56:23,500
They got people to think that aliens were invading, you know?

2529
01:56:23,500 --> 01:56:25,340
And I noticed that all-

2530
01:56:25,340 --> 01:56:26,180
That's what they do.

2531
01:56:26,180 --> 01:56:29,380
And they think they're cool dumbing people down

2532
01:56:29,380 --> 01:56:31,420
and that all feeds back on them and their families.

2533
01:56:31,420 --> 01:56:32,900
They're all so dumb as well.

2534
01:56:32,900 --> 01:56:35,220
These people are all so self-centered.

2535
01:56:35,220 --> 01:56:36,480
They literally are just thinking about

2536
01:56:36,480 --> 01:56:39,060
what parties they're going to to act powerful

2537
01:56:39,060 --> 01:56:40,540
because they like being looked at

2538
01:56:40,540 --> 01:56:42,040
and feeling powerful all day.

2539
01:56:42,040 --> 01:56:43,640
They're mental midgets.

2540
01:56:43,640 --> 01:56:47,060
Only our weakness has let them take over.

2541
01:56:47,060 --> 01:56:49,460
Yeah, have you noticed how all these reporters,

2542
01:56:49,460 --> 01:56:51,980
when they're supposedly on the scene,

2543
01:56:51,980 --> 01:56:54,240
it seems like they're standing in front of a screen

2544
01:56:54,240 --> 01:56:56,140
or something, like they're in a studio.

2545
01:56:56,140 --> 01:56:59,920
Like, whether it's Fox or CBS or MSNBC,

2546
01:56:59,920 --> 01:57:02,980
all their reporters, when they're supposedly on the scene,

2547
01:57:02,980 --> 01:57:04,060
I don't know, I mean, to me-

2548
01:57:04,060 --> 01:57:07,820
Sir, I have CNN footage from the first Gulf War

2549
01:57:07,820 --> 01:57:09,060
with them with a blue screen

2550
01:57:09,060 --> 01:57:10,360
because they sent it over the live feed

2551
01:57:10,360 --> 01:57:12,420
before it was added in, claiming it was live.

2552
01:57:12,420 --> 01:57:15,300
And they're joking, eating food, smoking marijuana.

2553
01:57:15,300 --> 01:57:18,300
Have you seen the fake Iraq war footage?

2554
01:57:18,300 --> 01:57:20,020
CNN show-

2555
01:57:20,020 --> 01:57:21,500
I mean, then it came out.

2556
01:57:21,500 --> 01:57:23,860
They even had a PBS documentary about it.

2557
01:57:23,860 --> 01:57:27,280
I mean, it's totally, they weren't even in Israel.

2558
01:57:27,280 --> 01:57:29,200
Yeah, they even had a director there

2559
01:57:29,200 --> 01:57:31,240
in one of those tall chairs sitting there.

2560
01:57:31,240 --> 01:57:32,420
I mean, it's a joke.

2561
01:57:32,420 --> 01:57:35,300
No, I know, and that's why you've got major professors now

2562
01:57:36,400 --> 01:57:38,260
coming out in mainstream news,

2563
01:57:38,260 --> 01:57:40,780
saying that there were clearly actors there.

2564
01:57:40,780 --> 01:57:42,420
Now, again, I haven't touched that.

2565
01:57:42,420 --> 01:57:44,020
I'm gonna be honest with you.

2566
01:57:44,020 --> 01:57:46,460
We've looked into it, and it looks pretty bad.

2567
01:57:46,460 --> 01:57:48,060
There were clearly some people killed there,

2568
01:57:48,060 --> 01:57:50,340
but they also, CIA talks about that in Northwoods,

2569
01:57:50,340 --> 01:57:52,820
how you have some actors on the scene to actually manage it.

2570
01:57:52,820 --> 01:57:54,140
And it turned out they had actors

2571
01:57:54,140 --> 01:57:56,660
also at the 7-7 bombing at the bus.

2572
01:57:56,660 --> 01:57:57,580
They even had a drill,

2573
01:57:57,580 --> 01:58:00,820
and they even hired a group to run the drill.

2574
01:58:00,820 --> 01:58:01,940
And that was even admitted.

2575
01:58:01,940 --> 01:58:04,260
I know, it's just, I know.

2576
01:58:04,260 --> 01:58:06,300
And the little sheep can't even understand it.

2577
01:58:06,300 --> 01:58:08,120
I mean, they don't have any idea.

2578
01:58:08,980 --> 01:58:10,540
They don't have any idea.

2579
01:58:10,540 --> 01:58:12,620
But see, they even planned for the psyop to come out,

2580
01:58:12,620 --> 01:58:13,740
because there were real people killed there.

2581
01:58:13,740 --> 01:58:14,940
I've looked into it.

2582
01:58:14,940 --> 01:58:16,580
But some of them, and then that way,

2583
01:58:16,580 --> 01:58:19,820
they can trot out the real families who don't know,

2584
01:58:19,820 --> 01:58:21,300
and go, look, they really died.

2585
01:58:21,300 --> 01:58:24,460
You see how sophisticated they are?

2586
01:58:24,460 --> 01:58:25,660
And then here I am,

2587
01:58:25,660 --> 01:58:28,020
just some guy that lives his life fighting this.

2588
01:58:28,020 --> 01:58:29,300
All of you can beat him too.

2589
01:58:29,300 --> 01:58:30,980
I mean, I'm not that smart.

2590
01:58:30,980 --> 01:58:32,380
God bless you, sir.

2591
01:58:32,380 --> 01:58:34,980

so I can really get to your calls.

2620

And if you also haven't had any sleep,

2621
02:00:29,500 --> 02:00:31,500
it's always important to work extra hard when you're exhausted.

2622
02:00:31,500 --> 02:00:33,500
The only thing that actually gives you more energy

2623
02:00:33,500 --> 02:00:34,500
is more work.

2624
02:00:34,500 --> 02:00:38,500
Oh, man.

2625
02:00:38,500 --> 02:00:40,500
They are coming after us on so many fronts right now,

2626
02:00:40,500 --> 02:00:41,500
ladies and gentlemen.

2627
02:00:41,500 --> 02:00:45,500
Let's go ahead and talk to John in Colorado.

2628
02:00:45,500 --> 02:00:46,500
You're on the air, brother.

2629
02:00:46,500 --> 02:00:47,500
Welcome.

2630
02:00:47,500 --> 02:00:48,500
Hey, Alex.

2631
02:00:48,500 --> 02:00:49,500
First-time caller.

2632
02:00:49,500 --> 02:00:51,500
Long-time listener.

2633
02:00:51,500 --> 02:00:53,500
Really, really appreciate everything you've done

2634
02:00:53,500 --> 02:00:55,500
and all the guests that you have on your show,

2635
02:00:55,500 --> 02:00:58,500
Joe Cilente, David Icke, all these guys.

2636
02:00:58,500 --> 02:01:01,500
And just going out there to New York

2637
02:01:01,500 --> 02:01:03,500
and being on the Piers Morgan show like that

2638
02:01:03,500 --> 02:01:05,500
is just incredible.

2639
02:01:05,500 --> 02:01:08,500
Well, it's not fun climbing in a wraith hole

2640
02:01:08,500 --> 02:01:11,500
but I went into a hell pit.

2641
02:01:11,500 --> 02:01:13,500
And let me tell you, it was the spiritual energy.

2642
02:01:13,500 --> 02:01:15,500
I don't like to get into things like that.

2643
02:01:15,500 --> 02:01:17,500
It's personal, but it was bad.

2644
02:01:17,500 --> 02:01:19,500
It was real bad.

2645
02:01:19,500 --> 02:01:22,500
Real bad feeling in there.

2646
02:01:22,500 --> 02:01:24,500
Yeah, well, I'm originally from New York

2647
02:01:24,500 --> 02:01:26,500
and it's really sad to see what's happened

2648
02:01:26,500 --> 02:01:28,500
to that city in the past.

2649
02:01:28,500 --> 02:01:30,500
Well, New York, I've always liked New York.

2650
02:01:30,500 --> 02:01:32,500
I got to be honest, I don't like Los Angeles.

2651
02:01:32,500 --> 02:01:34,500
I just have a bad feeling when I'm there

2652
02:01:34,500 --> 02:01:35,500
and I'm a smog or whatever.

2653
02:01:35,500 --> 02:01:36,500
I like New York.

2654
02:01:36,500 --> 02:01:38,500
I mean, there's a beauty next to the ugliness,

2655
02:01:38,500 --> 02:01:40,500
a lot of energy, a lot of great people.

2656
02:01:40,500 --> 02:01:44,500
I like New York, but you could see

2657
02:01:44,500 --> 02:01:46,500
that the economy is really hurting those folks

2658
02:01:46,500 --> 02:01:49,500
and also what happened during the last storm.

2659
02:01:49,500 --> 02:01:51,500
But what doesn't kill you only makes you stronger.

2660
02:01:51,500 --> 02:01:53,500
It's just that I don't know how New Yorkers do it.

2661
02:01:53,500 --> 02:01:55,500
I mean, I don't think I could afford to live in New York.

2662
02:01:55,500 --> 02:01:57,500
I know I couldn't run this operation.

2663
02:01:57,500 --> 02:02:00,500
I mean, it's just, my point is I've never had people

2664
02:02:00,500 --> 02:02:03,500
except when I've been in really poor third world countries

2665
02:02:03,500 --> 02:02:06,500
looking at the food I was ordering and looking at it

2666
02:02:06,500 --> 02:02:08,500
and eating their little meal and looking over

2667
02:02:08,500 --> 02:02:10,500
and you could tell they wanted my food,

2668
02:02:10,500 --> 02:02:13,500
which wasn't even in the middle of the most expensive.

2669
02:02:13,500 --> 02:02:16,500
I mean, I got a small steak, an eight ounce steak,

2670
02:02:16,500 --> 02:02:21,500
because I'm going on this no gluten diet.

2671
02:02:21,500 --> 02:02:25,500
So I'll go have a steak and some asparagus or whatever.

2672
02:02:25,500 --> 02:02:26,500
It doesn't matter.

2673
02:02:26,500 --> 02:02:28,500
Sorry, go ahead and make a point.

2674
02:02:28,500 --> 02:02:30,500
Oh, no, I just, yeah, I feel you

2675
02:02:30,500 --> 02:02:33,500
when you're out to eat or you're a high profile figure,

2676
02:02:33,500 --> 02:02:34,500
so it's quite different.

2677
02:02:34,500 --> 02:02:38,500
But I have people just looking over, acting all judgmental

2678
02:02:38,500 --> 02:02:41,500
and people just don't know how to mind their own business.

2679
02:02:41,500 --> 02:02:42,500
No, no, that's it.

2680
02:02:42,500 --> 02:02:45,500
They grovel to government and then they peck at other people

2681
02:02:45,500 --> 02:02:47,500
or they just keep their head down.

2682
02:02:47,500 --> 02:02:51,500
The television, it's not just the television's mode.

2683
02:02:51,500 --> 02:02:55,500
It's what they put out on it and everything's just jointed.

2684
02:02:55,500 --> 02:02:58,500
I was watching, like I said, sitcoms and dramas flying out

2685
02:02:58,500 --> 02:03:01,500
and then flying back, I mean, like four hours each way

2686
02:03:01,500 --> 02:03:03,500
or three and a half one way four hours back

2687
02:03:03,500 --> 02:03:05,500
into the jet stream.

2688
02:03:05,500 --> 02:03:08,500
And every show was just disjointed quick cuts,

2689
02:03:08,500 --> 02:03:12,500
no attention span, gibbering mindlessness.

2690
02:03:12,500 --> 02:03:15,500
And they admit that rewires the brain.

2691
02:03:15,500 --> 02:03:18,500
But it's rewiring their brains.

2692
02:03:18,500 --> 02:03:21,500
I mean, I've studied elites and most elites are smart enough

2693
02:03:21,500 --> 02:03:23,500
to not want to have total enslavement

2694
02:03:23,500 --> 02:03:25,500
because that ends up taking them down.

2695
02:03:25,500 --> 02:03:28,500
Only the really decadent ones at the end of a cycle

2696
02:03:28,500 --> 02:03:31,500
or who are total megalomaniacs like Hitler

2697
02:03:31,500 --> 02:03:33,500
do this overexpansion deal.

2698
02:03:33,500 --> 02:03:35,500
I mean, these guys are going to fail.

2699
02:03:35,500 --> 02:03:37,500
They will destroy themselves.

2700
02:03:37,500 --> 02:03:40,500
I mean, I hope people realize that.

2701
02:03:40,500 --> 02:03:42,500
Yeah, yeah, me too.

2702
02:03:42,500 --> 02:03:45,500
Things are getting, you know, things are getting crazy.

2703
02:03:45,500 --> 02:03:48,500
It's just, it's a crazy time and things are intensifying

2704
02:03:48,500 --> 02:03:50,500
and you know, that's why I thank you

2705
02:03:50,500 --> 02:03:52,500
for being there on the front lines.

2706
02:03:52,500 --> 02:03:53,500
No, no, thank you.

2707
02:03:53,500 --> 02:03:54,500
What could I have done better though?

2708
02:03:54,500 --> 02:03:56,500
There's so many things I wanted to point out.

2709
02:03:56,500 --> 02:03:58,500
Like, you're the guys that took guns out of schools.

2710
02:03:58,500 --> 02:04:00,500
You're the ones that advertise them as kill zones.

2711
02:04:00,500 --> 02:04:02,500
I got that out.

2712
02:04:02,500 --> 02:04:04,500
Yeah, well, you did a lot.

2713
02:04:04,500 --> 02:04:06,500
You ran through a lot of stuff very quickly

2714
02:04:06,500 --> 02:04:08,500
and you were in his face and aggressive.

2715
02:04:08,500 --> 02:04:12,500
So I don't think you could have done any more really.

2716
02:04:12,500 --> 02:04:18,500
Well, I, and again, I was never going to overturn a table.

2717
02:04:18,500 --> 02:04:20,500
It was just funny that a caller earlier said,

2718
02:04:20,500 --> 02:04:21,500
you know, it was Aaron.

2719
02:04:21,500 --> 02:04:22,500
He said like Christ overturning the money.

2720
02:04:22,500 --> 02:04:25,500
Christ beat the globalist, the bankers,

2721
02:04:25,500 --> 02:04:27,500
the money manipulators, the Ponzi scheme operators,

2722
02:04:27,500 --> 02:04:30,500
the con men, the parasites with a whip.

2723
02:04:30,500 --> 02:04:32,500
And you know, that was my point.

2724
02:04:32,500 --> 02:04:34,500
It's like, you know, like Christ turned the table over.

2725
02:04:34,500 --> 02:04:36,500
But of course I would never do that.

2726
02:04:36,500 --> 02:04:38,500
The point is, is that it's funny Aaron brought that up

2727
02:04:38,500 --> 02:04:41,500
because we were joking about that.

2728
02:04:41,500 --> 02:04:43,500
I also joked about it to my wife.

2729
02:04:43,500 --> 02:04:44,500
She's like, don't do that.

2730
02:04:44,500 --> 02:04:46,500
I'm like, I'm joking.

2731
02:04:46,500 --> 02:04:48,500
But I mean, that's how domesticated we've got.

2732
02:04:48,500 --> 02:04:50,500
They're all armed with force against us,

2733
02:04:50,500 --> 02:04:53,500
but we need to keep our voices down and bend over for the TSA

2734
02:04:53,500 --> 02:04:56,500
because Bin Laden might be hiding in your pants.

2735
02:04:56,500 --> 02:05:00,500
Zero dark 30 in me.

2736
02:05:00,500 --> 02:05:05,500

Supernatural Silver can be taken orally every day

there is an increased need to support our immunity and health.

At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs

2753
02:06:10,500 --> 02:06:14,500
by providing a full selection of silver-based products.

2754
02:06:14,500 --> 02:06:19,500
Our most popular silver-based products are the 32 oz. nano silver solutions,

2755
02:06:19,500 --> 02:06:22,500
our 2 oz. nano silver nasal applicators,

2756
02:06:22,500 --> 02:06:25,500
as well as our all-natural silver soaps.

2757
02:06:25,500 --> 02:06:29,500
Just released is our 100% natural silver gel.

2758
02:06:29,500 --> 02:06:33,500
Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents,

2759
02:06:33,500 --> 02:06:36,500
which quickly evaporate and leave the silver at the surface.

2760
02:06:36,500 --> 02:06:39,500
But rather, we have formulated our silver gel

2761
02:06:39,500 --> 02:06:42,500
using the natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera

2762
02:06:42,500 --> 02:06:45,500
to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin

2763
02:06:45,500 --> 02:06:48,500
while delivering the silver more effectively.

2764
02:06:48,500 --> 02:06:51,500

2767
02:07:00,500 --> 02:07:04,500
You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms.

2768
02:07:04,500 --> 02:07:07,500
But if you don't have a home security system,

2769
02:07:07,500 --> 02:07:10,500
then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.

2770
02:07:10,500 --> 02:07:14,500
When you're sleeping, who's watching out for intruders and spooks?

2771
02:07:14,500 --> 02:07:16,500
Check out SimpliSafe.

2772

That's www.getsimplisafe.com.

2784
02:08:03,500 --> 02:08:10,500
Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.

2785
02:08:33,500 --> 02:08:45,500
We crank that up.

2786
02:08:45,500 --> 02:08:51,500
Don't tread on me.

2787
02:08:51,500 --> 02:09:00,500
Once provoked.

2788
02:09:00,500 --> 02:09:12,500
If you prepare for war.

2789
02:09:12,500 --> 02:09:16,500
Don't tread on me.

2790
02:09:16,500 --> 02:09:20,500
Metallica, don't tread on me.

2791
02:09:20,500 --> 02:09:23,500
Don't tread on me.

2792
02:09:23,500 --> 02:09:32,500
Love it or leave it.

2793
02:09:32,500 --> 02:09:34,500
Yeah, I mean, love it or leave it, man.

2794
02:09:34,500 --> 02:09:35,500
Don't tread on me.

2795
02:09:35,500 --> 02:09:37,500
Look, I'm not looking for trouble.

2796
02:09:37,500 --> 02:09:39,500
Do you think you're going to walk on me?

2797
02:09:39,500 --> 02:09:44,500
It isn't going to happen.

2798
02:09:44,500 --> 02:09:50,500
No, no, no, no.

2799
02:09:50,500 --> 02:09:59,500
To secure peace, to prepare for war.

2800
02:09:59,500 --> 02:10:01,500
Let's go to DrudgeReport.com.

2801
02:10:01,500 --> 02:10:04,500
And again, I've just got to give credit where credit's due.

2802
02:10:04,500 --> 02:10:10,500
Drudge is just continually backing us up and it's absolutely making the system pull their hair out.

2803
02:10:10,500 --> 02:10:12,500
But I mean, this is the news of America.

2804
02:10:12,500 --> 02:10:13,500
This is what's happening.

2805
02:10:13,500 --> 02:10:15,500
We're battling for the Republican.

2806
02:10:15,500 --> 02:10:23,500
If you don't know what Bloomberg and Obama and Nancy Pelosi and the things they're doing, these are tyrants.

2807
02:10:23,500 --> 02:10:31,500
And, you know, I just saw the Drudge headline, British House Mocks Scary Americans.

2808
02:10:31,500 --> 02:10:34,500
And the truth is it blew up in his face attacking the Second Amendment.

2809
02:10:34,500 --> 02:10:36,500
That's admitted.

2810
02:10:36,500 --> 02:10:40,500
And he looked like a defeated man when I was there.

2811
02:10:40,500 --> 02:10:41,500
And again, they were crying.

2812
02:10:41,500 --> 02:10:42,500
They were freaking out.

2813
02:10:42,500 --> 02:10:45,500
I mean, as I described, the Kennedys were like cowering in the corner.

2814
02:10:45,500 --> 02:10:47,500
Dershowitz was running from me.

2815
02:10:47,500 --> 02:10:50,500
The thing was, Dew was told there were three segments.

2816
02:10:50,500 --> 02:10:51,500
So he's in the green room.

2817
02:10:51,500 --> 02:10:54,500
I said videotape the TV screen because it looks cool.

2818
02:10:54,500 --> 02:10:56,500
And they were all, wouldn't let him with his cameras out of the room.

2819
02:10:56,500 --> 02:10:58,500
But the door opens, they're telling him to get out.

2820
02:10:58,500 --> 02:11:01,500
And Dershowitz and the Kennedys are coming by and I'm like, Dew, get over here.

2821
02:11:01,500 --> 02:11:03,500
He got some of it on tape.

2822
02:11:03,500 --> 02:11:09,500
And I'm like, Dershowitz was told to run by the people.

2823
02:11:09,500 --> 02:11:12,500
And I'm being nice, I go, Mr. Dershowitz, I'd like a photo.

2824
02:11:12,500 --> 02:11:17,500
And he went, this fake, I have a sheep, like programming.

2825
02:11:17,500 --> 02:11:21,500
These globalists have programmed us because they're the most programmable, I found.

2826
02:11:21,500 --> 02:11:25,500
I'm like, Mr. Dershowitz, I want a photo.

2827
02:11:25,500 --> 02:11:30,500
And he goes, you wanna make me feel good like a narcissist?

2828
02:11:30,500 --> 02:11:34,500
And the producer, her name's mentioned in the Drudge Report.

2829
02:11:34,500 --> 02:11:35,500
I forget it.

2830
02:11:35,500 --> 02:11:37,500
I'm looking up on my phone.

2831
02:11:37,500 --> 02:11:40,500
Bernstein goes, no.

2832
02:11:40,500 --> 02:11:43,500
I mean, it's just like the door slams.

2833
02:11:43,500 --> 02:11:45,500
He's like, get out of here now.

2834
02:11:45,500 --> 02:11:47,500
I mean, it was just like the wicked flee when none pursue.

2835
02:11:47,500 --> 02:11:53,500
I always use that quote that kind of ruins it, the beginning of the new True Grit, which

2836
02:11:53,500 --> 02:11:58,500
is even better than the first, I gotta say, the amazing directors.

2837
02:11:58,500 --> 02:12:01,500
I mean, they have that quote, the wicked flee when none pursue.

2838
02:12:01,500 --> 02:12:03,500
I mean, that's why they want our guns.

2839
02:12:03,500 --> 02:12:06,500
I mean, they went on the show and the Kennedys are like, very scary, man.

2840
02:12:06,500 --> 02:12:07,500
We need to get his guns.

2841
02:12:07,500 --> 02:12:09,500
And Dershowitz, we have the clip coming up for calls.

2842
02:12:09,500 --> 02:12:11,500
He doesn't deserve to have them.

2843
02:12:11,500 --> 02:12:13,500
The Second Amendment means we take them.

2844
02:12:13,500 --> 02:12:16,500
Yes, Pierce, the audience is that dumb.

2845
02:12:16,500 --> 02:12:18,500
The Second Amendment means you turn your guns in.

2846
02:12:18,500 --> 02:12:21,500
I'm the expert, I said.

2847
02:12:21,500 --> 02:12:22,500
You know what?

2848
02:12:22,500 --> 02:12:26,500
How about you take a hike, pal?

2849
02:12:26,500 --> 02:12:29,500
How about you take a hike?

2850
02:12:29,500 --> 02:12:34,500
How about you jump in the lake, fly a kite?

2851
02:12:34,500 --> 02:12:36,500
You know what that means, don't you?

2852
02:12:36,500 --> 02:12:40,500
Let's go ahead and talk to Andrew in Iowa.

2853
02:12:40,500 --> 02:12:43,500
You're on the air, unscreened worldwide.

2854
02:12:43,500 --> 02:12:46,500
Well, thank you, Alex.

2855
02:12:46,500 --> 02:12:48,500
Yes, sir, thank you.

2856
02:12:48,500 --> 02:12:54,500
I'm a new listener, watching on Prison Planet TV for about a month now.

2857
02:12:54,500 --> 02:13:00,500
And I just want to say, I love the movies, and thank you for opening my eyes to the ideas

2858
02:13:00,500 --> 02:13:04,500
of false flags and agent provocateurs.

2859
02:13:04,500 --> 02:13:09,500
I've been following the responses on the Internet, and your presentation of the facts has been

2860
02:13:09,500 --> 02:13:15,500
repeatedly challenged, people saying you overreacted.

2861
02:13:15,500 --> 02:13:20,500
But I believe this is because you are changing people's paradigms, and this unfortunately

2862
02:13:20,500 --> 02:13:23,500
shines a light on the dark side of our reality.

2863
02:13:23,500 --> 02:13:24,500
Yeah, that's it.

2864
02:13:24,500 --> 02:13:26,500
I'm here to get you like bang, bang, bang.

2865
02:13:26,500 --> 02:13:27,500
Hey, Bob, your house is on fire.

2866
02:13:27,500 --> 02:13:29,500
Hey, I was really sleeping good.

2867
02:13:29,500 --> 02:13:32,500
There's smoke, but I'm going back to bed.

2868
02:13:32,500 --> 02:13:35,500
And I'm telling you, if Bob didn't get out of his house, I'd probably kick the door down

2869
02:13:35,500 --> 02:13:37,500
if he had kids and go get Bob and his kids out.

2870
02:13:37,500 --> 02:13:41,500
Just because that's how I am, I'm not going to sit there while little kids roast, not

2871
02:13:41,500 --> 02:13:42,500
because I'm a hero.

2872
02:13:42,500 --> 02:13:46,500
Listen, we have crawdads that we caught in the creek by our house that are in the fish

2873
02:13:46,500 --> 02:13:48,500
tank, because I had them when I was a kid.

2874
02:13:48,500 --> 02:13:49,500
They're great to feed.

2875
02:13:49,500 --> 02:13:51,500
They're really smart little guys.

2876
02:13:51,500 --> 02:13:55,500
One of them climbs up the intake deal, and I'm going to go back to you in a minute, put

2877
02:13:55,500 --> 02:13:56,500
him on hold.

2878
02:13:56,500 --> 02:13:58,500
I'm going to tell the story, because I thought about this today.

2879
02:13:58,500 --> 02:14:05,500
And he goes out, and three times now, usually in the morning when he escapes, well, all

2880
02:14:05,500 --> 02:14:07,580
three times, actually, there's this little lobster.

2881
02:14:07,580 --> 02:14:12,500
It's a crawdad, but it's basically a freshwater lobster, because we're a little when we got

2882
02:14:12,500 --> 02:14:13,500
him.

2883
02:14:13,500 --> 02:14:15,860
He's big now in like six months, because my kid's overfeeding.

2884
02:14:15,860 --> 02:14:20,020
He shed his skin a bunch of different times, his exoskeleton.

2885
02:14:20,020 --> 02:14:24,580
And we'll always find him, he's smart, like going for the back door, and the dogs come

2886
02:14:24,580 --> 02:14:30,620
over, and he starts chasing them whenever they come at him.

2887
02:14:30,620 --> 02:14:31,620
And you know why?

2888
02:14:31,620 --> 02:14:32,620
It's not because he's a tough guy.

2889
02:14:32,620 --> 02:14:35,740
I call him Houdini, because he's escaped three times.

2890
02:14:35,740 --> 02:14:42,580
It's because he understands that with any animal, if he goes at them, they're going

2891
02:14:42,580 --> 02:14:46,660
to think he's powerful and back off.

2892
02:14:46,660 --> 02:14:48,180
And so he isn't conscious.

2893
02:14:48,180 --> 02:14:52,420
He can't build rocket ships, he can't do calculus.

2894
02:14:52,420 --> 02:14:55,900
He doesn't know what a 57 Chevy looks like.

2895
02:14:55,900 --> 02:15:02,460
But he knows that, hey, I just climbed up a intake tube to the filter, and just went

2896
02:15:02,460 --> 02:15:07,900
through a tiny space up there, and just jumped off the tank down to the floor.

2897
02:15:07,900 --> 02:15:12,500
And I've just gone out, and I'm at the door, and these dogs are coming over to me.

2898
02:15:12,500 --> 02:15:15,060
And we come around, he's chasing the dogs around the house.

2899
02:15:15,060 --> 02:15:20,420
By the way, I got a lab that kills raccoons, I mean, is vicious.

2900
02:15:20,420 --> 02:15:26,620
He's a nice dog to humans, but look out raccoons, and he's, because you know what, if a raccoon

2901
02:15:26,620 --> 02:15:27,620
runs, they're dead.

2902
02:15:27,620 --> 02:15:30,320
This little crawfish goes at them.

2903
02:15:30,320 --> 02:15:37,620
And we gotta act like that crawfish, okay, that crawdad, crayfish.

2904
02:15:37,620 --> 02:15:38,660
And that's how I am.

2905
02:15:38,660 --> 02:15:42,660
It's not courage, man, bullies get in my face.

2906
02:15:42,660 --> 02:15:47,740
If there's a way out of it, as I've grown older, I try to find a way out of it.

2907
02:15:47,740 --> 02:15:55,140
But it's like, hey, Katie Barr the door if you get me cornered, because all my wiring

2908
02:15:55,140 --> 02:15:59,660
is to open 14 cans of kick butt.

2909
02:15:59,660 --> 02:16:05,060
And it's not because I'm Mr. Tough Stuff, I'm like that crawdad.

2910
02:16:05,060 --> 02:16:08,500
And I know an enemy when I see one, and I know a threat when I see one, and I'm not

2911
02:16:08,500 --> 02:16:09,500
backing off.

2912
02:16:09,500 --> 02:16:11,500
I'm sorry, go ahead, Andrew.

2913
02:16:11,500 --> 02:16:17,900
Well, yeah, when you show people the light and they've been living in the dark, it's

2914
02:16:17,900 --> 02:16:20,300
like they cringe, they're shocked.

2915
02:16:20,300 --> 02:16:24,580
But I think you do an amazing job of getting people's attention, and they listen to what

2916
02:16:24,580 --> 02:16:29,540
you speak about, and you hold their attention.

2917
02:16:29,540 --> 02:16:34,500
People can look up the facts for their self once they're aware of what to look up.

2918
02:16:34,500 --> 02:16:39,940
And other people can lead the way and more gently waking people up, maybe more politely

2919
02:16:39,940 --> 02:16:42,580
or easing the light on.

2920
02:16:42,580 --> 02:16:48,300
But the truth is the truth no matter how it's presented, and I think you do a good job exposing

2921
02:16:48,300 --> 02:16:49,300
it.

2922
02:16:49,300 --> 02:16:50,620
So I just appreciate your show.

2923
02:16:50,620 --> 02:16:52,220
No, I appreciate you, brother.

2924
02:16:52,220 --> 02:16:54,100
And again, we've got wide open phones.

2925
02:16:54,100 --> 02:16:57,500
Yeah, Weldon came back here, head of our shipping department.

2926
02:16:57,500 --> 02:17:01,820
And he said, I've never, because he reads Yahoo every day, everybody gets into their

2927
02:17:01,820 --> 02:17:02,820
own thing.

2928
02:17:02,820 --> 02:17:07,900
Jacobson reads Yahoo every day, that's what his homepage is, mine's Drudge or M4s.

2929
02:17:07,900 --> 02:17:15,780
And it has like 15,000 comments, he says he's never seen anything like that.

2930
02:17:15,780 --> 02:17:21,140
Yeah, there it is, man behind the Port Piers Morgan petition has meltdown on Morgan's show,

2931
02:17:21,140 --> 02:17:22,780
a meltdown.

2932
02:17:22,780 --> 02:17:30,220
Yeah, that's when I really blew up at him, the cop that called earlier, the police officer.

2933
02:17:30,220 --> 02:17:33,900
That was when he said the London riots didn't happen and I was a liar.

2934
02:17:33,900 --> 02:17:39,540
I mean, it's just like saying the moon wasn't a harvest moon, it was so beautiful, like

2935
02:17:39,540 --> 02:17:44,820
5 AM when I walked into the airport this morning.

2936
02:17:44,820 --> 02:17:47,340
Somebody tells me I'm not wearing a black shirt, I'm like, hey man, I'm wearing a black

2937
02:17:47,340 --> 02:17:48,340
shirt.

2938
02:17:48,340 --> 02:17:49,340
No, you're not.

2939
02:17:49,340 --> 02:17:50,740
I'm like, you know what, I don't like you.

2940
02:17:50,740 --> 02:17:55,380
I mean, I'm just tired of these people playing games, it's confidence games.

2941
02:17:55,380 --> 02:17:59,660
I mean, if somebody showed up at my office and said, hey, I'm gonna sell you the Texas

2942
02:17:59,660 --> 02:18:04,940
Capitol, I own it, $1,000 cash right now, I'd say, get off my porch, I'm gonna call

2943
02:18:04,940 --> 02:18:05,940
the police.

2944
02:18:05,940 --> 02:18:08,940
Boom, boom, boom, no, I own the Capitol, $1,000.

2945
02:18:08,940 --> 02:18:14,260
Man, I already told you, buddy, see, I can't tell the government get off my porch, they

2946
02:18:14,260 --> 02:18:17,420
run my life, and I'm sick of it, and I know they're a bunch of liars.

2947
02:18:17,420 --> 02:18:23,420
Yeah, 14,800 comments, or 18 comments, well, it's only 15,000, it's 14,000, but he's rounding

2948
02:18:23,420 --> 02:18:24,420
up, that's good.

2949
02:18:24,420 --> 02:18:28,980
Let's go ahead and talk to Mike in California, and we're gonna skip this break, cuz this

2950
02:18:28,980 --> 02:18:33,860
is such news breaking, and I need to get to more calls, I'm gonna customarily hurt the

2951
02:18:33,860 --> 02:18:36,300
network and lose thousands of dollars.

2952
02:18:36,300 --> 02:18:41,780
I'm sorry, I'm joking, it's just byproducts from all our sponsors, they're great.

2953
02:18:41,780 --> 02:18:45,100
Let's go ahead, and I'm pretty tired, folks, I haven't had sleep in the last few days.

2954
02:18:45,100 --> 02:18:50,580
Let's go ahead and talk to Mike, wants to comment, listening on KOMY 1340 AM.

2955
02:18:50,580 --> 02:18:53,940
Go ahead, you're on the air there in Santa Cruz, San Francisco, go ahead.

2956
02:18:53,940 --> 02:18:59,060
Hi, Alex, yeah, I had my friend Chris call me last night, she said, Alex is on Piers

2957
02:18:59,060 --> 02:19:05,460
Morgan, so I tuned in, your points were really on point, you know, you said a couple calls

2958
02:19:05,460 --> 02:19:09,100
back what you could have done better, and I was thinking about that as the show was

2959
02:19:09,100 --> 02:19:14,300
unfolding, I thought, you know, based on this format, you can't really do any better than

2960
02:19:14,300 --> 02:19:22,820
you did, for those that had ears to hear, you know, it was a landmark show, I mean,

2961
02:19:22,820 --> 02:19:32,180
we just hit on the points, and even addressing, you know, Piers' some of his, you know, stance

2962
02:19:32,180 --> 02:19:40,660
and philosophy, and it was, for those that had ears to hear, it was a real key broadcast

2963
02:19:40,660 --> 02:19:44,580
for that particular audience that wouldn't listen to you on internet or radio.

2964
02:19:44,580 --> 02:19:48,860
Well, it's now being reported by AP, and this is what I saw rumblings of, I mean, you know

2965
02:19:48,860 --> 02:19:56,740
when you're on a ship of politically dead men, he had the look of a reanimated corpse,

2966
02:19:56,740 --> 02:20:02,460
and I don't just say that to be mean, I mean, I was, he looked, all these evil people that

2967
02:20:02,460 --> 02:20:09,460
sell out, they don't have any vitality, and they were all completely freaked out, I heard

2968
02:20:09,460 --> 02:20:13,060
some of them, I was there like an hour before, I don't know what I'm gonna do when this happens,

2969
02:20:13,060 --> 02:20:18,540
they're now announcing she's gonna get some super late slot with no viewers, and then

2970
02:20:18,540 --> 02:20:21,540
he'll probably be gone in a year when his contract's up, can you guys put that back

2971
02:20:21,540 --> 02:20:22,540
up?

2972
02:20:22,540 --> 02:20:28,220
So of course he's declaring his victory, they were crying and panicking and routed, and

2973
02:20:28,220 --> 02:20:34,500
he ran around saying, I'm scared, I'm scared, with his tail between his legs, I mean, how

2974
02:20:34,500 --> 02:20:37,540
are we ruled by these snakes?

2975
02:20:37,540 --> 02:20:41,580
CNN host Piers Morgan could join the late night crowd, the Slumping Cable News Network

2976
02:20:41,580 --> 02:20:46,600
is considering moving his hour long interview show from the prize 9 PM slot back to 10 PM,

2977
02:20:46,600 --> 02:20:53,860
or even later, The Post has learned, while sources said no decisions have been made,

2978
02:20:53,860 --> 02:20:59,580
incoming CNN chief, Jeff Zucker, and his new boss at Time Warner are focused on boosting

2979
02:20:59,580 --> 02:21:03,500
ratings in the prime time hours from 7 PM to 10 PM.

2980
02:21:03,500 --> 02:21:09,660
Yeah, he had the look of a defeated man, he were defeated a long time ago, Morgan, I even

2981
02:21:09,660 --> 02:21:14,780
offered him, I said, why don't you join America, I'll take you out shooting, join me, and at

2982
02:21:14,780 --> 02:21:19,140
the end, we did that demonic laugh during the break when they kicked me out of there,

2983
02:21:19,140 --> 02:21:24,300
I said, you will be defeated, and he just looks so weak, and that's what I want our

2984
02:21:24,300 --> 02:21:27,460
listeners to know, these people are weak, anything else, Mike?

2985
02:21:27,460 --> 02:21:35,420
Yeah, well, that's the thing is, on the Sandy Hook thing, I understood that the AR actually

2986
02:21:35,420 --> 02:21:39,620
stayed in the car, can you clarify what actually happened with what was actually used?

2987
02:21:39,620 --> 02:21:43,460
Buddy, I'll tell you this, I am not gonna tell you what I think, cuz they're waiting

2988
02:21:43,460 --> 02:21:50,940
for me to do it, but I told my entire crew, hold back, and just let it all come out, and

2989
02:21:50,940 --> 02:21:51,940
then we'll cover it later.

2990
02:21:51,940 --> 02:21:56,740
I told you, there's a lot of stuff I don't get into, because I can't 100% prove it, but

2991
02:21:56,740 --> 02:22:02,420
my good old boy guts, my spidey sense is never wrong, I'm only wrong when I don't follow

2992
02:22:02,420 --> 02:22:03,420
it.

2993
02:22:03,420 --> 02:22:09,260
South Florida Sun Sentinel, FAU professor stirs controversy by disputing Newtown massacre

2994
02:22:09,260 --> 02:22:16,060
communications professor known for conspiracy theories, has stirred controversy, that means

2995
02:22:16,060 --> 02:22:20,740
questioning known liars, is being an conspiracy theorist.

2996
02:22:20,740 --> 02:22:25,980
I mean, if you didn't get in the yellow Volkswagen with Ted Bundy, you'd be a conspiracy theorist.

2997
02:22:25,980 --> 02:22:29,380
He probably told young women that, don't worry about me, baby, I know there's been some kidnappings

2998
02:22:29,380 --> 02:22:35,420
and murders, but you're a conspiracy theorist, if you don't get in the car with me, I'm gonna

2999
02:22:35,420 --> 02:22:38,980
put this wire around your hands now, I got this gun to your head.

3000
02:22:38,980 --> 02:22:43,620
He'd still tell them too, don't resist, you'll be all right, and they still could have fought.

3001
02:22:43,620 --> 02:22:48,220
But they just wanted to believe, okay, everything's gonna be all right, don't you use?

3002
02:22:48,220 --> 02:22:53,740
Yeah, let me get this gag on you, we're going to a shack up in the hills, I'm gonna take

3003
02:22:53,740 --> 02:22:57,300
real good care of you after I torture you for two weeks.

3004
02:22:57,300 --> 02:23:02,940
See, not me, I'm like, you know what, I'm gonna keep my guns and I'm not gonna put handcuffs

3005
02:23:02,940 --> 02:23:03,940
on.

3006
02:23:03,940 --> 02:23:09,100
And they even teach people psychologically, it's good to be in bondage, it's good, the

3007
02:23:09,100 --> 02:23:14,340
government, 50 shades of gray, it's sexy to be chained up.

3008
02:23:14,340 --> 02:23:20,300
You know what, New World Order, you can go chain yourselves up, and I'm not gonna be

3009
02:23:20,300 --> 02:23:21,300
there, okay?

3010
02:23:21,300 --> 02:23:24,300
You can just go like a bunch of skeletons, no, no, you wanna suck off life, you wanna

3011
02:23:24,300 --> 02:23:26,900
chain life down and suck our blood out.

3012
02:23:26,900 --> 02:23:33,300
Thank you for the call, sir, yeah, and he goes on, moreover, James Tracy, I'm gonna

3013
02:23:33,300 --> 02:23:38,220
put him on, asserts in radio interviews and on his memoryholeblog.com, I think I've heard

3014
02:23:38,220 --> 02:23:43,780
of that, that trained crisis actors, well, we knew this weeks ago that, well, we actually

3015
02:23:43,780 --> 02:23:46,700
knew it years ago, we sent reporters up, they have these crisis actors that go all around

3016
02:23:46,700 --> 02:23:50,260
the country and they tell the kids it's a real shooting when it's happening.

3017
02:23:50,260 --> 02:23:53,980
All you do then is run a drill and, well, you know the rest of the story.

3018
02:23:53,980 --> 02:23:57,780
Many have been employed by the Obama administration in an attempt to shape public opinion in favor

3019
02:23:57,780 --> 02:24:00,380
of the event's true purpose, gun control.

3020
02:24:00,380 --> 02:24:05,580
Yeah, they come in and announce, AP, you can look this up, we're homeschoolers against

3021
02:24:05,580 --> 02:24:09,060
public education and pro-gun, we're here to kill you.

3022
02:24:09,060 --> 02:24:13,060
And they go put guns to like six-year-olds heads, I mean, and if you're a new listener,

3023
02:24:13,060 --> 02:24:18,020
you're like, I don't believe that, or if you're media, you got LexisNexis, you got all the

3024
02:24:18,020 --> 02:24:21,180
systems, just go look it up.

3025
02:24:21,180 --> 02:24:27,620
By the way, you know Kurt Nemo has a unlisted number and so does his wife, it's a new cell

3026
02:24:27,620 --> 02:24:31,980
phone when he moved here to Austin a couple years ago from New Mexico.

3027
02:24:31,980 --> 02:24:37,800
And did you know that CNN got his unlisted number and his wife's unlisted number and

3028
02:24:37,800 --> 02:24:41,500
called them on Christmas wanting to set me up for Piers Morgan when he got back on the

3029
02:24:41,500 --> 02:24:42,780
seventh yesterday?

3030
02:24:42,780 --> 02:24:46,060
And did you know they got my number?

3031
02:24:46,060 --> 02:24:51,340
And the police don't know where I live, most of them, police, they think they know where

3032
02:24:51,340 --> 02:24:55,120
I live.

3033
02:24:55,120 --> 02:24:58,220
And I said, how do you know that, and she gave me some BS lines, but she was, well,

3034
02:24:58,220 --> 02:24:59,220
I can't tell you.

3035
02:24:59,220 --> 02:25:04,820
And I said, I know how, you've got the Department of Defense on the next floor, and she's like,

3036
02:25:04,820 --> 02:25:06,180
how do you know that?

3037
02:25:06,180 --> 02:25:12,700
Well, I mean, it's all public, dummy, you see, if you're awake, this stuff's all right

3038
02:25:12,700 --> 02:25:13,700
there.

3039
02:25:13,700 --> 02:25:18,460
This is all designer people that just suspend disbelief and watch the news like it's real.

3040
02:25:18,460 --> 02:25:23,620
I mean, who can call my house and tell us what we were just talking about as a way to

3041
02:25:23,620 --> 02:25:25,180
freak us out?

3042
02:25:25,180 --> 02:25:29,740
And then tell us, by the way, Shaw, you go out to your car a few minutes ago, hope you

3043
02:25:29,740 --> 02:25:30,740
sleep well.

3044
02:25:30,740 --> 02:25:35,320
Well, I hope you sleep well being a sack of garbage.

3045
02:25:35,320 --> 02:25:39,140
They've got our phones tapped, they're doing it all, it doesn't intimidate me, it gets

3046
02:25:39,140 --> 02:25:44,820
me angry, and they're roaches.

3047
02:25:44,820 --> 02:25:48,700
Gary in New York, you're on the air, thanks for holding, brother.

3048
02:25:48,700 --> 02:25:52,460
What's going on, Mr. Jones, I was praying for you last night.

3049
02:25:52,460 --> 02:25:54,500
I need the prayers, it was pretty crazy.

3050
02:25:54,500 --> 02:26:03,100
I was seeing the video when you put it on late at night, I wouldn't put it past CNN

3051
02:26:03,100 --> 02:26:04,100
or NYPD.

3052
02:26:04,100 --> 02:26:09,660
I just had a couple CNN comments that tie into my Sandy Hook comment, even though I

3053
02:26:09,660 --> 02:26:12,620
know you said you didn't really wanna touch on it too much.

3054
02:26:12,620 --> 02:26:19,940
Well, I mean, here's the deal, we've seen about 12, 13 smoking guns that are just, each

3055
02:26:19,940 --> 02:26:24,140
one of them, look, look, look, the Batman shooting, I'll say, totally staged.

3056
02:26:24,140 --> 02:26:28,180
On drugs, now confirmed, DARPA mind control, I mean, the guy's in a mind control program

3057
02:26:28,180 --> 02:26:32,820
with the Department of Defense DARPA Brain Interface Grant.

3058
02:26:32,820 --> 02:26:39,460
I mean, and I just keep going from there, so look, the good news is you guys have all

3059
02:26:39,460 --> 02:26:42,620
figured it out, so just go with it, brother, go ahead.

3060
02:26:42,620 --> 02:26:48,580
Well, that's the thing, when I was watching last night, I was like, I wonder if he's gonna

3061
02:26:48,580 --> 02:26:55,540
really hit them hard with the psy-op information, cuz all I was thinking about is gaslighting.

3062
02:26:55,540 --> 02:27:02,620
CNN is a perfect example, you could tell them CNN's colors on the screen are red, and they

3063
02:27:02,620 --> 02:27:05,580
could lie, and people would still believe them.

3064
02:27:05,580 --> 02:27:08,220
But- No, it's all about telling you, that's what

3065
02:27:08,220 --> 02:27:11,500
gaslighting is, psychological warfare thing, and people don't know.

3066
02:27:11,500 --> 02:27:15,020
Where you're like, no, no, you're not at the beach, and you're at the beach, you're like,

3067
02:27:15,020 --> 02:27:16,020
I'm not.

3068
02:27:16,020 --> 02:27:19,900
You're at the beach, and humans are so trusting with those that they care about, and we see

3069
02:27:19,900 --> 02:27:23,740
TV as all that cares, it's the official people that speak so well.

3070
02:27:23,740 --> 02:27:28,900
And they're like, there's not tyranny, and the government's not arming against you, there's

3071
02:27:28,900 --> 02:27:32,380
no foreign banks taking over, there's no new world order.

3072
02:27:32,380 --> 02:27:36,340
But coming up next, world government's being announced, but the extremists talk about it.

3073
02:27:36,340 --> 02:27:40,660
Yeah, I mean, look, I had points, I actually have those points.

3074
02:27:40,660 --> 02:27:42,620
I was gonna get into false flags.

3075
02:27:42,620 --> 02:27:48,940
In fact, I had another paper in the same printout I did before we left, Sunday night I wrote

3076
02:27:48,940 --> 02:27:49,940
this.

3077
02:27:49,940 --> 02:27:53,180
I had a thing with a bunch of other notes I hand wrote, I'd lost it, it had my real

3078
02:27:53,180 --> 02:27:55,780
notes, but it had false flagging on it.

3079
02:27:55,780 --> 02:27:58,220
So in fact, I think false flag is on here.

3080
02:27:58,220 --> 02:28:01,540
So yes, sir, that was something I was gonna get to, but it was just continuing.

3081
02:28:01,540 --> 02:27:55,780
Answer the question, how many people ate ham sandwiches in West

3082
02:27:55,780 --> 02:28:14,220
and you're like, well, I know people didn't eat ham sandwiches, I know the Earl of Sandwich

3083
02:28:14,220 --> 02:28:17,700
actually developed it in the 1600s cuz he liked to gamble.

3084
02:28:17,700 --> 02:28:22,300
I know that actually, though, the Romans and others would put meat inside of bread to hold

3085
02:28:22,300 --> 02:28:23,300
it.

3086
02:28:23,300 --> 02:28:27,100
So the Earl of Sandwich was the popularization of the name sandwich, but I can't tell you

3087
02:28:27,100 --> 02:28:33,700
how many ham sandwiches were eaten in Derbyshire or Quackershire or Schnuperschneier at a certain

3088
02:28:33,700 --> 02:28:34,700
date.

3089
02:28:34,700 --> 02:28:36,700
Do you see what I'm saying?

3090
02:28:36,700 --> 02:28:43,540
No, I understand, and when the red code says that you're scaring people and using fear

3091
02:28:43,540 --> 02:28:50,820
mongering to have people go and buy guns, if anything, he should blame Obama and Feinstein.

3092
02:28:50,820 --> 02:28:52,020
You don't have anything to do.

3093
02:28:52,020 --> 02:28:57,200
No, they're the ones that made them gun-free zones back in the 90s, Clinton popularized

3094
02:28:57,200 --> 02:28:58,200
it.

3095
02:28:58,200 --> 02:29:01,580
And then tell everybody, this is the place, don't commit suicide if you're just gonna,

3096
02:29:01,580 --> 02:29:05,540
a lot of people go commit suicide by cop, we're gonna go to break and make more calls.

3097
02:29:05,540 --> 02:29:10,140
They commit suicide by cop, but now the media's like, no, no, no, don't do that.

3098
02:29:10,140 --> 02:29:13,300
Don't go pull a gun on a cop and have him kill you cuz you're too scared to shoot yourself

3099
02:29:13,300 --> 02:29:14,980
or you like the idea of it.

3100
02:29:14,980 --> 02:29:17,100
The place to go is a school.

3101
02:29:17,100 --> 02:29:21,980
And boy, they really didn't like that, I watched their faces when I was like, you're the one

3102
02:29:21,980 --> 02:29:22,980
who's advertising.

3103
02:29:22,980 --> 02:29:26,820
I said, Piers, you know when somebody jumps off the Empire States building, the next three

3104
02:29:26,820 --> 02:29:32,260
days they, cuz I've read in the news, they put extra cops there cuz even though there's

3105
02:29:32,260 --> 02:29:35,100
high fences, people climb over and it causes a cascade.

3106
02:29:35,100 --> 02:29:39,220
And he's like, yeah, well, that's what you guys are doing, hyping this over and over

3107
02:29:39,220 --> 02:29:40,440
again.

3108
02:29:40,440 --> 02:29:47,380
Every screwball on your sponsor's medication is watching this and you're putting it in

3109

3114
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:15,040

3115

3169
02:34:14,700 --> 02:34:21,380
a line from first time I met Charlie Sheen's ex-wife because they were getting divorced

3170
02:34:21,380 --> 02:34:25,380
when I first got to know him back in like 2005.

3171
02:34:25,380 --> 02:34:28,580
First time I met, I'm not name dropping, it's just a funny story because I make that joke.

3172
02:34:28,580 --> 02:34:36,080
Sometimes I say to the guys in the office, we take you now live to Klandathu and Charlie

3173
02:34:36,080 --> 02:34:41,020
Sheen's ex-wife, Denise Richards, of course, her first starring role was in that movie

3174
02:34:41,020 --> 02:34:50,100
and the first time I met her, I walked up to her and shook her hand and said, we take

3175
02:34:50,100 --> 02:34:54,180
you now live to Klandathu and she was like, excuse me?

3176
02:34:54,180 --> 02:35:02,560
And I was like, we take you now live to Klandathu and she was like, ah, Klandathu.

3177
02:35:02,560 --> 02:35:07,020
First time I talked to her, Charlie Sheen's sitting there, we're sitting around his pool

3178
02:35:07,020 --> 02:35:11,560
and he hands me his phone, he says, say hi to Denise because they talk all the time.

3179
02:35:11,560 --> 02:35:14,780
And I'd been there like six months before and I said, because I knew her pug because

3180
02:35:14,780 --> 02:35:18,060
it stays at both houses, I said, how is this pug?

3181
02:35:18,060 --> 02:35:20,900
I forget his name, it'll pop my head in a minute.

3182
02:35:20,900 --> 02:35:29,220
I got pictures of him and stuff, real sweet pugs, I like dogs and the phone goes click

3183
02:35:29,220 --> 02:35:34,660
and then I hand the phone back to Charlie and he kind of went, eh, he's the kind of

3184
02:35:34,660 --> 02:35:37,500
guy that doesn't really say anything.

3185
02:35:37,500 --> 02:35:42,460
And then like a month later, I'm in the grocery store and it's something about her prize pug

3186
02:35:42,460 --> 02:35:45,820
dying and it was that pug.

3187
02:35:45,820 --> 02:35:49,980
Why am I even telling this story?

3188
02:35:49,980 --> 02:35:54,480
Because I am sleep deprived, I'm going into the fourth hour, ladies and gentlemen, that's

3189
02:35:54,480 --> 02:35:56,740
the kind of stuff that I worry about.

3190
02:35:56,740 --> 02:36:02,260
I'm like, my God, Denise Richards, who I haven't talked to since, that was like a year ago

3191
02:36:02,260 --> 02:36:07,100
or something, more than that, thinks I made a joke about her dead dog.

3192
02:36:07,100 --> 02:36:14,500
That dog's name's gonna pop in my head as soon as I'm off air.

3193
02:36:14,500 --> 02:36:22,700
Anyways, by the way, the media lied and said Charlie didn't feed it enough, that dog was

3194
02:36:22,700 --> 02:36:27,700
probably overfed, it was so fat, which was what was so cute about it.

3195
02:36:27,700 --> 02:36:28,700
What was that?

3196
02:36:28,700 --> 02:36:30,500
There's the black pug and then there's the gold pug.

3197
02:36:30,500 --> 02:36:34,380
And we've got all this serious stuff to talk about, look, I shouldn't be on air right now,

3198
02:36:34,380 --> 02:36:36,540
I should take off the next few days.

3199
02:36:36,540 --> 02:36:41,440
It's abnormal how much I work and it's downright bad, because I do a better job when I take

3200
02:36:41,440 --> 02:36:46,660
off and come in ripping, roaring, but I can't help it, so I apologize.

3201
02:36:46,660 --> 02:36:53,180
John Rappaport's written a new article that we're posting up at Infowars.com right now.

3202
02:36:53,180 --> 02:36:56,380
Alex Jones, best night of television ever, and it's a really good report, I was reading

3203
02:36:56,380 --> 02:36:57,900
it during the break.

3204
02:36:57,900 --> 02:37:00,580
Was Rappaport on yesterday?

3205
02:37:00,580 --> 02:37:03,580
He was, okay, good guy, I don't really like John Rappaport.

3206
02:37:03,580 --> 02:37:07,500
Okay, I'm gonna shut up, I know I haven't even gotten to clips, appears Morgan, it's

3207
02:37:07,500 --> 02:37:08,620
so annoying to hear his voice.

3208
02:37:08,620 --> 02:37:12,500
We haven't gotten to Dershowitz yet, let's play the Dershowitz and I promise I'll go

3209
02:37:12,500 --> 02:37:15,940
to a bunch of your calls and we'll go into the next hour and Aaron's gonna be in here

3210
02:37:15,940 --> 02:37:16,940
as well.

3211
02:37:16,940 --> 02:37:20,940
By the way, can you guys go get lunch, cuz Aaron was gonna go, but he's chomping at the

3212
02:37:20,940 --> 02:37:21,940
bit to talk about stuff.

3213
02:37:21,940 --> 02:37:26,500
He didn't say it, but I can tell, cuz he thought I'd get here like an hour late and I got here

3214
02:37:26,500 --> 02:37:28,420
on time, the flight wasn't delayed.

3215
02:37:28,420 --> 02:37:33,660
Will you go get the food so he can come here and do the last 30 minutes with me of the

3216
02:37:33,660 --> 02:37:36,100
fourth hour of overdrive?

3217
02:37:36,100 --> 02:37:43,500
Okay, let's go just here for a moment, let's go to the lawyer, Alan Dershowitz, who I was

3218
02:37:43,500 --> 02:37:48,620
supposed to debate, cuz they told me, they said, Alan Dershowitz is gonna be debating,

3219
02:37:48,620 --> 02:37:49,620
you know who he is?

3220
02:37:49,620 --> 02:37:53,660
And I went, yeah, I know a great deal about him, a quack lawyer, represents high profile

3221
02:37:53,660 --> 02:37:59,980
criminals and just a simpering pimp of the media who says that torture's a great thing,

3222
02:37:59,980 --> 02:38:01,700
government should be able to do it.

3223
02:38:01,700 --> 02:38:06,400
And he's pro war and tyranny and because you call him liberal, it's supposedly great.

3224
02:38:06,400 --> 02:38:10,700
That's how they get liberals out there watching CNN and they're like, whoa, whoa, whoa, actually

3225
02:38:10,700 --> 02:38:14,860
I didn't say all that, but that's what I was gonna say to him on air.

3226
02:38:14,860 --> 02:38:18,180
I was like, no, he's so powerful, how will I debate him?

3227
02:38:18,180 --> 02:38:20,700
And I told Pierce at the beginning of the debate, I said, I think you're gonna check

3228
02:38:20,700 --> 02:38:23,300
it out, you're not gonna get me to the third segment.

3229
02:38:23,300 --> 02:38:27,540
And they did that because when he sat there and went, how dare you want dead children?

3230
02:38:27,540 --> 02:38:32,220
I'm like, dude, you're the one that was defending Abu Ghraib and stuff.

3231
02:38:32,220 --> 02:38:36,420
I mean, you were defending the government's torture program, they were torturing little

3232
02:38:36,420 --> 02:38:37,580
kids there.

3233
02:38:37,580 --> 02:38:41,340
I mean, these people are monsters.

3234
02:38:41,340 --> 02:38:47,880
So here is Alan Dershowitz, who again was creeping around.

3235
02:38:47,880 --> 02:38:53,700
We don't give Skeksi awards very often, and I know John Baon has the Skeksi award video

3236
02:38:53,700 --> 02:38:55,140
somewhere around here.

3237
02:38:55,140 --> 02:38:56,900
Can we boot up the Skeksi award?

3238
02:38:56,900 --> 02:39:02,240
Just go to YouTube, it's the death of the Skeksi emperor, dark crystal.

3239
02:39:02,240 --> 02:39:06,140
For those on radio who wanna see it, actually we could edit it together for the radio show

3240
02:39:06,140 --> 02:39:12,620
tonight, and we can show my debate with Piers Morgan, that would actually be Alan Dershowitz.

3241
02:39:12,620 --> 02:39:17,220
But we can also show the banquet of Alan Dershowitz.

3242
02:39:17,220 --> 02:39:20,700
But I mean, he's real liberal, folks, and he says, I don't deserve to own a gun.

3243
02:39:20,700 --> 02:39:23,940
And the Second Amendment means I can have my guns taken, and that he's scared of me

3244
02:39:23,940 --> 02:39:26,840
having guns, yes, sir.

3245
02:39:26,840 --> 02:39:30,700
But I'm scared of people like him being in control, cuz they wanna have me disappear

3246
02:39:30,700 --> 02:39:33,680
into the NDAA and have my teeth pulled out with pliers.

3247
02:39:33,680 --> 02:39:39,340
But because he says it was a nice little old man voice, that makes it okay.

3248
02:39:39,340 --> 02:39:46,780
Remember NPR, hello, everybody, it's now time for NPR, funded by the Rockefeller Brothers

3249
02:39:46,780 --> 02:39:47,780
Foundation.

3250
02:39:47,780 --> 02:39:52,220
We're gonna talk real soft while we drag this knife across your carotid arteries.

3251
02:39:52,220 --> 02:39:58,900
All right, all right, let's go quietly, again, child, I have a peppermint here if you just

3252
02:39:58,900 --> 02:39:59,900
get in the van.

3253
02:39:59,900 --> 02:40:03,620
I mean, come on, secret arrest is good and torture is good.

3254
02:40:03,620 --> 02:40:11,020
The scary man is that scary American, British host mock scary Americans is the headline.

3255
02:40:11,020 --> 02:40:16,460
And it's so scary, it's so bad, they said, don't trust the government like George Washington

3256
02:40:16,460 --> 02:40:19,220
said, it's scary.

3257
02:40:19,220 --> 02:40:23,580
He doesn't want us to torture and disappear you and put you in vans.

3258
02:40:23,580 --> 02:40:27,140
That's scary to us, be nice.

3259
02:40:27,140 --> 02:40:30,780
Be nice to us, so let's go ahead and go to Alan Dershowitz, here it is.

3260
02:40:30,780 --> 02:40:35,700
Well, it's much more dangerous than nonsense, I mean, he was essentially comparing President

3261
02:40:35,700 --> 02:40:37,580
Bush to Adolf Hitler.

3262
02:40:37,580 --> 02:40:42,780
He was saying that somebody, the criminal elements within our banks, the Bloombergs,

3263
02:40:42,780 --> 02:40:43,780
the national banks.

3264
02:40:43,780 --> 02:40:47,460
Here's the point of honor, you can't dismiss him as just a crackpot because millions of

3265
02:40:47,460 --> 02:40:51,900
Americans tune into him now on a daily basis and believe what he says.

3266
02:40:51,900 --> 02:40:52,900
But let me tell you-

3267
02:40:52,900 --> 02:40:58,740
That is why, to me, he's a very relevant guest here, and he perfectly exemplifies the problem.

3268
02:40:58,740 --> 02:41:03,420
And the reason you perform such a great service by having him on is he usually preaches to

3269
02:41:03,420 --> 02:41:06,340
his own little paranoid choir.

3270
02:41:06,340 --> 02:41:09,520
People who listen to him are either listening to him for entertainment purposes, the way

3271
02:41:09,520 --> 02:41:14,340
I sometimes listen to Rush Limbaugh, or because they really believe it.

3272
02:41:14,340 --> 02:41:15,340
Now you expose them-

3273
02:41:15,340 --> 02:41:16,340
We have a little exchange actually.

3274
02:41:16,340 --> 02:41:17,340
To a general audience.

3275
02:41:17,340 --> 02:41:20,700
This is a little exchange that happened just right at the end here, which others haven't

3276
02:41:20,700 --> 02:41:21,700
seen yet.

3277
02:41:21,700 --> 02:41:27,340
And I'm here to tell you, 1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms, doesn't

3278
02:41:27,340 --> 02:41:30,620
matter how many lemmings you get out there on the street begging for them to have their

3279
02:41:30,620 --> 02:41:31,660
guns taken.

3280
02:41:31,660 --> 02:41:34,540
We will not relinquish them, do you understand?

3281
02:41:34,540 --> 02:41:39,220
That's why you're going to fail and the establishment knows no matter how much propaganda, the republic

3282
02:41:39,220 --> 02:41:42,340
will rise again when you attempt to take our guns.

3283
02:41:42,340 --> 02:41:47,260
You see, when you have this debate on the East Coast or even the West Coast, I find

3284
02:41:47,260 --> 02:41:50,660
that a lot of Americans come up to me and they're totally behind what I'm trying to

3285
02:41:50,660 --> 02:41:51,900
do, which is a very specific thing.

3286
02:41:51,900 --> 02:41:57,300
It's not about taking away his right to defend himself or his family at home or to grab anybody's

3287
02:41:57,300 --> 02:41:58,300
guns other than-

3288
02:41:58,300 --> 02:42:04,340
Ladies and gentlemen, I actually saw the article, I saw a bunch of articles in USA Today, drop

3289
02:42:04,340 --> 02:42:05,340
my phone.

3290
02:42:05,340 --> 02:42:10,500
I saw a bunch of articles in here, but they had one in here about a giant settlement paid

3291
02:42:10,500 --> 02:42:11,900
out.

3292
02:42:11,900 --> 02:42:17,500
Foreclosure abuse case settled for 8.5 billion, borrowers to get cash or aid for mortgage

3293
02:42:17,500 --> 02:42:23,980
services, but it's a fraction of the tens of thousands of innocent homes.

3294
02:42:23,980 --> 02:42:28,140
Innocent people who, some cases have their whole house paid for with cash, are paid for.

3295
02:42:28,140 --> 02:42:30,240
The bank never even had the note.

3296
02:42:30,240 --> 02:42:32,020
They never were even involved.

3297
02:42:32,020 --> 02:42:35,620
It's not just like they made a mistake and came and got a mortgage they shouldn't have

3298
02:42:35,620 --> 02:42:40,780
and the court was so pliant, they went along with it.

3299
02:42:40,780 --> 02:42:47,660
Because the banks give money to the judges' reelection and remuniation, remuniation, remuniation,

3300
02:42:47,660 --> 02:42:51,340
I'm having trouble saying that word, remunination.

3301
02:42:51,340 --> 02:42:54,300
How do you say it?

3302
02:42:54,300 --> 02:42:57,300
How do you say, I'm having trouble with that word.

3303
02:42:57,300 --> 02:43:00,780
Yeah, no, no, the term is paying people.

3304
02:43:00,780 --> 02:43:09,340
The point is, is that we're sitting here looking at this, let me show people this or Piers

3305
02:43:09,340 --> 02:43:11,740
Morgan will say it doesn't exist.

3306
02:43:11,740 --> 02:43:17,300
There's no USA Today, there were no riots in England, liar.

3307
02:43:17,300 --> 02:43:24,980
All right, we have Alan Dershowitz here, put him on screen, the radio listeners please

3308
02:43:24,980 --> 02:43:25,980
immediately.

3309
02:43:25,980 --> 02:43:43,620
Oh that's just the club where they make their little happy sounds, remember they raise taxes

3310
02:43:43,620 --> 02:43:51,180
or strip a family of their property, and put you in a FEMA camp, all right, that's enough,

3311
02:43:51,180 --> 02:43:52,180
that's enough.

3312
02:43:52,180 --> 02:44:01,200
The clip he won is the death of the Skeksi Emperor guys, that's actually footage of an

3313
02:44:01,200 --> 02:44:06,300
award ceremony with Alan Dershowitz being given an award by Nancy Pelosi.

3314
02:44:06,300 --> 02:44:11,340
Your radio listener, it's not as funny, he had to see the video.

3315
02:44:11,340 --> 02:44:16,180
All right, continuing here, did Drudge cause the Alex Jones interview?

3316
02:44:16,180 --> 02:44:22,940
See now it's, this is from Politico, now it's Matt Drudge's fault because he pointed out

3317
02:44:22,940 --> 02:44:28,340
on his Twitter, I don't even know about this, two weeks ago that I should interview.

3318
02:44:28,340 --> 02:44:31,200
You know what happened?

3319
02:44:31,200 --> 02:44:36,040
The article hadn't been up 10 minutes and we were landing in New York, and as we're

3320
02:44:36,040 --> 02:44:40,720
coming down the plane, dude had never turned his phone off obviously, he goes, look, you're

3321
02:44:40,720 --> 02:44:46,220
on Drudge and clicks it at about 10,000 feet right as the internet started working.

3322
02:44:46,220 --> 02:44:53,660
And then I get a text going, I hear you almost got arrested with the TSA, and I land and

3323
02:44:53,660 --> 02:44:55,780
call her like five minutes later.

3324
02:44:55,780 --> 02:44:59,760
And I'm like, that article's been out like 15 minutes, how did you know?

3325
02:44:59,760 --> 02:45:03,540
Because all they do is look at drudgereport.com.

3326
02:45:03,540 --> 02:45:07,660
So now Politico, they're like barracuda circling, they can't stand the fact that they don't

3327
02:45:07,660 --> 02:45:09,400
control things.

3328
02:45:09,400 --> 02:45:15,280
Then we credit Matt Drudge for bringing together Alex Jones, the radio host, gun advocate and

3329
02:45:15,280 --> 02:45:17,660
conspiracy theorist, and Piers Morgan.

3330
02:45:17,660 --> 02:45:21,100
Turns out the founder of Drudge Report suggested Morgan interviewed Jones almost two weeks

3331
02:45:21,100 --> 02:45:22,100
ago.

3332
02:45:22,100 --> 02:45:28,180
A reader flags the tweet, flag it like you flagged bad stuff, you found it like he hit

3333
02:45:28,180 --> 02:45:29,180
it.

3334
02:45:29,180 --> 02:45:39,020
Zucker, there you 9 PM, Piers Morgan, real Alex Jones, crossfire for the ages, Ted Turner

3335
02:45:39,020 --> 02:45:46,220
special guest, dressed in Confederate garb, that's funny.

3336
02:45:46,220 --> 02:45:49,380
And then they freak out about it, busy people are just crazy.

3337
02:45:49,380 --> 02:45:52,140
And Piers Morgan, should he have an audience this big?

3338
02:45:52,140 --> 02:45:58,460
I am a reasonable sycophant of the crown, caught in innumerable scams.

3339
02:45:58,460 --> 02:46:04,940
And I'm here trying to order you with a snot-nosed beak to hand in your firearms and you're not

3340
02:46:04,940 --> 02:46:08,420
submitting to me, good lord.

3341
02:46:08,420 --> 02:46:12,300
By the way, we didn't get to the part yet, have we played the part where Dershowitz says

3342
02:46:12,300 --> 02:46:18,080
the Second Amendment means I can have my guns taken, that I'm scary and shouldn't have guns?

3343
02:46:18,080 --> 02:46:19,860
Is it still queued up?

3344
02:46:19,860 --> 02:46:24,740
All right, we'll just queue it up to that, that's what I want, cuz I mean, listening

3345
02:46:24,740 --> 02:46:29,940
to his sniveling, I'll sit up here, Dershowitz now has an English accent as well.

3346
02:46:29,940 --> 02:46:33,940
I'll sit up here and I will dictate reality, here's Piers Morgan.

3347
02:46:33,940 --> 02:46:38,580
Well, you have massive riots, record knife murders, people's heads being bashed in, the

3348
02:46:38,580 --> 02:46:42,900
highest in Europe, triples that took the guns, here, here's the London Telegraph, UK's violent

3349
02:46:42,900 --> 02:46:47,160
crime capital of Europe, here, here Piers, here's the article of the statistics.

3350
02:46:47,160 --> 02:46:53,540
I handed him this article, same copy, I printed that out today, and he's like, there is no

3351
02:46:53,540 --> 02:46:56,780
such thing, lies.

3352
02:46:56,780 --> 02:47:02,080
So there weren't riots all over England, from Sheffield to London, from Cornwall to Essex

3353
02:47:02,080 --> 02:47:03,420
burning things.

3354
02:47:03,420 --> 02:47:08,020
No, I control reality, blah, blah, blah.

3355
02:47:08,020 --> 02:47:13,220
Maybe I should go out and buy a $5,000 suit, cuz Piers Morgan has an $8 million contract

3356
02:47:13,220 --> 02:47:15,100
to talk to half a million people a day.

3357
02:47:15,100 --> 02:47:19,780
I mean, talk about delusions, I mean, talk about impersonal clothes, weaving imaginary

3358
02:47:19,780 --> 02:47:24,980
golden sweaters that he'll pay anything for, the globalist will.

3359
02:47:24,980 --> 02:47:32,500
And he's just on the news saying, no, you're a liar, liar, I demand that we fight and fence

3360
02:47:32,500 --> 02:47:34,020
with the death.

3361
02:47:34,020 --> 02:47:38,280
But Piers, that would blame the swords then, not you wielding the sword.

3362
02:47:38,280 --> 02:47:43,080
Let's go ahead and I'm gonna do the rest of this hour in the Piers Morgan void, but even

3363
02:47:43,080 --> 02:47:44,080
more sycophantic.

3364
02:47:44,080 --> 02:47:49,740
Roger in Texas, I'm actually doing a William F Buckley, sycophantic fake East Coast accent,

3365
02:47:49,740 --> 02:47:51,460
Robert Baron, Colbert accent.

3366
02:47:51,460 --> 02:47:57,340
Roger from Texas, you are on the air, I am William F Buckley of the Central Intelligence

3367
02:47:57,340 --> 02:48:02,020
Agency, here to control and steer the conservative movement into the sewer line.

3368
02:48:02,020 --> 02:48:06,940
Roger, do you have a point here, or are you just too impressed with this affected voice

3369
02:48:06,940 --> 02:48:07,940
right now?

3370
02:48:07,940 --> 02:48:14,980
I do like the voice, but I had a few points to make, first I wanted to congratulate you

3371
02:48:14,980 --> 02:48:19,020
on your performance on Piers Morgan, you really had him backed into the corner, I think.

3372
02:48:19,020 --> 02:48:23,100
I am Piers Morgan, my dear boy, go ahead now.

3373
02:48:23,100 --> 02:48:28,460
In your petty little American brain, I, Piers Morgan, put out tweets about how stupid you

3374
02:48:28,460 --> 02:48:33,900
are and how dumb, scary Americans are, you pathetic little worm.

3375
02:48:33,900 --> 02:48:37,100
You don't have a snot, shut up.

3376
02:48:37,100 --> 02:48:40,540
Do you hear that I have a snot nose?

3377
02:48:40,540 --> 02:48:46,260
I do not breathe through my snoot, my proboscis while I talk to you, you little man.

3378
02:48:46,260 --> 02:48:49,660
I'm sorry, go ahead, go ahead, American provincial.

3379
02:48:49,660 --> 02:48:55,900
Yes sir, well, I wanted to say, excellent performance on Piers Morgan.

3380
02:48:55,900 --> 02:49:00,060
You know, when, actually I especially like the part where you asked him to put up a boxing

3381
02:49:00,060 --> 02:49:06,140
ring, I think both myself and Piers Morgan were expecting for you to just stand up and

3382
02:49:06,140 --> 02:49:12,500
kick him in the face right there, I was actually hoping for that, but you know, when I heard

3383
02:49:12,500 --> 02:49:15,940
that you were going to be on Piers Morgan, the first time I heard it about a week or

3384
02:49:15,940 --> 02:49:24,180
so ago, I suppose, I predicted, and I told this to my dad, that Piers Morgan is definitely

3385
02:49:24,180 --> 02:49:29,220
not going to attack Alex Jones the way he did all his other guests that he previously

3386
02:49:29,220 --> 02:49:33,660
had on, because I knew that he was a little bit intimidated of you, and I guess I couldn't

3387
02:49:33,660 --> 02:49:37,900
be so ignorant as to think that Piers Morgan has never heard of your show, you know, with

3388
02:49:37,900 --> 02:49:45,420
all the ratings that you're drawing now, and as that is the case, I started to question,

3389
02:49:45,420 --> 02:49:49,580
why is it that Piers Morgan would have you on, knowing that you were just going to back

3390
02:49:49,580 --> 02:49:53,500
him into the corner the whole time, and the conclusion I came to was, he wanted to have

3391
02:49:53,500 --> 02:50:00,140
you on there, knowing that you were going to just totally explode on him, and he wanted

3392
02:50:00,140 --> 02:50:05,940
to paint you off as some kind of crazy person, and it's kind of funny, because just like

3393
02:50:05,940 --> 02:50:12,140
all the other things that the New World Order does, he's basically had it backfired on him,

3394
02:50:12,140 --> 02:50:21,060
you know, number two on Twitter in the US, and the top ten worldwide now, just like all

3395
02:50:21,060 --> 02:50:26,540
the shootings in Aurora, in Connecticut, gun sales are soaring, everything the New World

3396
02:50:26,540 --> 02:50:30,020
Order is doing is just completely backfiring on them.

3397
02:50:30,020 --> 02:50:35,140
They're there with all these sycophants around them, and they're rotting, I mean, Piers Morgan

3398
02:50:35,140 --> 02:50:39,460
works in a place with feces splattered on the wall, and I was going to go take photos

3399
02:50:39,460 --> 02:50:46,540
of it, but I just got run out of there before I could, I mean, he works in a den of diarrhea,

3400
02:50:46,540 --> 02:50:52,860
splattered on the walls in a rotting carcass of a media empire run by the eugenicist, demon

3401
02:50:52,860 --> 02:51:01,460
Nazi Ted Turner, well said, my friend, well said, we shall return after this break.

3402
02:51:01,460 --> 02:51:05,780
Weakened by GMOs, stressed out about money, and blasted by the electric environment.

3403
02:51:05,780 --> 02:51:11,380
Hi, I'm Pastor Jenny, and that was the state I was in back in 2010, then I learned about

3404
02:51:11,380 --> 02:51:12,580
RNA drops.

3405
02:51:12,580 --> 02:51:18,300
I learned that 97% of my DNA that scientists have called junk is actually packed with millions

3406
02:51:18,300 --> 02:51:23,060
of gene switches that play a critical role in controlling how my cells, organs, and other

3407
02:51:23,060 --> 02:51:24,220
tissues behave.

3408
02:51:24,220 --> 02:51:28,220
I learned I don't have to put up with disease decay or decline like I'd been conditioned

3409
02:51:28,220 --> 02:51:29,220
to believe.

3410
02:51:29,220 --> 02:51:35,020
I began taking RNA drops, a 100% natural formula designed to turn on those switches and provide

3411
02:51:35,020 --> 02:51:37,180
me with amazing health and joy.

Hi there, my name is Frank Bates, what I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could

3417
02:52:05,380 --> 02:52:07,140
get me in a lot of trouble.

3418
02:52:07,140 --> 02:52:13,380
I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity

3419
02:52:13,380 --> 02:52:17,980
monopolies and government agencies for what they really are, incompetent lying crooks

3420
02:52:17,980 --> 02:52:23,220
that are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high.

3421
02:52:23,220 --> 02:52:27,220
Some have called this a conspiracy, others have called it a cover up and you will be

3422
02:52:27,220 --> 02:52:31,120
shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy goes.

3423
02:52:31,120 --> 02:52:36,760
My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them

3424
02:52:36,760 --> 02:52:39,200
and how you can beat them too.

3425
02:52:39,200 --> 02:52:42,940
Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen

3426
02:52:42,940 --> 02:52:44,660
in the last three months.

3427
02:52:44,660 --> 02:52:50,040
Go to 123coverup.com and discover one weird trick to slash your power bill and protect

3428
02:52:50,040 --> 02:52:51,040
your home.

3429
02:52:51,040 --> 02:52:57,140
Go watch my video now at 123coverup.com before they force me to shut it down.

3430
02:52:57,140 --> 02:52:59,140
Again, that's 123coverup.com.

3431
02:52:59,140 --> 02:53:05,180
Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the bestselling book Cancer Step Outside the Box.

3432
02:53:05,180 --> 02:53:08,140
I want you to know some very important information.

3433
02:53:08,140 --> 02:53:12,940
In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White

3434
02:53:12,940 --> 02:53:17,260
House at a time when only the President could obtain its world class healer.

3435
02:53:17,260 --> 02:53:22,820
Now 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.

3436
02:53:22,820 --> 02:53:27,900
Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally

3437
02:53:27,900 --> 02:53:33,040
occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single

3438
02:53:33,040 --> 02:53:34,180
normal cell.

3439
02:53:34,180 --> 02:53:37,940
If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune

3440
02:53:37,940 --> 02:53:41,940
cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.

3441
02:53:41,940 --> 02:53:49,860
Call 1-866-VenusFly or order from Carnivora.com, that's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A.com.

3442
02:53:49,860 --> 02:53:57,220
That's 1-866-836-8735, 1-866-VenusFly or visit Carnivora.com.

3443
02:53:57,220 --> 02:54:06,380
Get your immune system, it's the only one you've got.

3444
02:54:06,380 --> 02:54:16,140
I was a highwayman, along the coach roads I did ride, sword and pistol by my side, many

3445
02:54:16,140 --> 02:54:25,860
a young maid lost her baubles to my trade, many a soldier, many a soldier shed his life

3446
02:54:25,860 --> 02:54:27,380
to the ground.

3447
02:54:27,380 --> 02:54:35,660
By the way, I saw a commenter begging me to ask Piers Morgan if he wanted to go back to

3448
02:54:35,660 --> 02:54:38,820
England to be the groom of the stool.

3449
02:54:38,820 --> 02:54:40,580
And I didn't get to that, that was actually one of the questions.

3450
02:54:40,580 --> 02:54:42,620
In the next hour, I'm going to go into overdrive.

3451
02:54:42,620 --> 02:54:44,100
Where did that go?

3452
02:54:44,100 --> 02:54:47,220
I actually have the real points I was going to make, so I'm going to get to, I'll get

3453
02:54:47,220 --> 02:54:50,820
to on air and continue with your calls and more of these clips.

3454
02:54:50,820 --> 02:54:56,820
But they try to keep it secret, but they continue, according to the reports we have, to continue

3455
02:54:56,820 --> 02:55:02,060
to groom the stool of British royalty.

3456
02:55:02,060 --> 02:55:08,220
And only the highest lordly officials get to wipe the hind ends of the queen, the king,

3457
02:55:08,220 --> 02:55:10,340
the queen mother, people like that.

3458
02:55:10,340 --> 02:55:16,860
And then they also store the droppings, so maybe that's what was on the walls at CNN.

3459
02:55:16,860 --> 02:55:22,500
Maybe the queen had been in there, and Piers had been in there with her.

3460
02:55:22,500 --> 02:55:26,700
People always think I'm joking and they Google, so I'm going to send it to him and say, hey,

3461
02:55:26,700 --> 02:55:29,260
go back to England and back to your grooming the stool there.

3462
02:55:29,260 --> 02:55:33,060
Because that's what you're going to be doing when we kick you out of here.

3463
02:55:33,060 --> 02:55:38,220
You thought you'd come over here and wow us with your British accent, get out, okay?

3464
02:55:38,220 --> 02:55:39,220
Get out of here.

3465
02:55:39,220 --> 02:55:42,780
Go live in London while they burn the city down or something.

3466
02:55:42,780 --> 02:55:50,220
By the way, we got video here of Alan Dershowitz before he got a cough drop from Piers Morgan

3467
02:55:50,220 --> 02:55:51,460
last night in the green room.

3468
02:55:51,460 --> 02:55:52,460
Here it is.

3469
02:55:52,460 --> 02:55:57,700
And we do have that clip, I thought we had that clip, we have the real Dershowitz clip

3470
02:55:57,700 --> 02:55:58,700
first.

3471
02:55:58,700 --> 02:56:01,820
Let's just go to that first hand as promised, cuz we're just the masters of these clips.

3472
02:56:01,820 --> 02:56:06,820
So here it is.

3473
02:56:06,820 --> 02:56:10,740
And the important thing is getting people like Alex Jones on this show is to hear him

3474
02:56:10,740 --> 02:56:14,980
actually say that he believed President Bush, the American administration under him, were

3475
02:56:14,980 --> 02:56:16,620
responsible for 9-11.

3476
02:56:16,620 --> 02:56:21,660
And that is why he wants Americans armed to defend themselves against that kind of murderous

3477
02:56:21,660 --> 02:56:22,660
tyranny.

3478
02:56:22,660 --> 02:56:26,780
And it's some of the most dangerous rhetoric I have heard in a very long time.

3479
02:56:26,780 --> 02:56:31,940
But it's very important that he be exposed on your show because decent Americans don't

3480
02:56:31,940 --> 02:56:36,740
want to be associated with that kind of paranoid view of American history.

3481
02:56:36,740 --> 02:56:43,220
They don't want to believe that our government is capable of engaging in the kind of tyranny

3482
02:56:43,220 --> 02:56:45,100
that he fears.

3483
02:56:45,100 --> 02:56:46,580
Government does a great deal of good for people.

3484
02:56:46,580 --> 02:56:47,580
Yes.

3485
02:56:47,580 --> 02:56:48,580
Injecting black people to syphilis.

3486
02:56:48,580 --> 02:56:49,580
There are reasons to constrain government.

3487
02:56:49,580 --> 02:56:50,580
Radiating troops.

3488
02:56:50,580 --> 02:56:51,580
That's why we have the Bill of Rights.

3489
02:56:51,580 --> 02:56:52,580
Killing a million Iraqis.

3490
02:56:52,580 --> 02:56:53,580
Second Amendment is part of the Bill of Rights.

3491
02:56:53,580 --> 02:56:54,580
Hold on, pause.

3492
02:56:54,580 --> 02:56:55,580
Justice Scalia.

3493
02:56:55,580 --> 02:56:57,620
They butchered the Bill of Rights and Constitution.

3494
02:56:57,620 --> 02:56:58,860
They're butchering the whole thing.

3495
02:56:58,860 --> 02:57:00,260
I defend the whole thing.

3496
02:57:00,260 --> 02:57:02,420
They were asking, why did you cause trouble with the TSA?

3497
02:57:02,420 --> 02:57:03,980
Cuz it's all dog training.

3498
02:57:03,980 --> 02:57:05,140
It's prisoner.

3499
02:57:05,140 --> 02:57:06,140
Put your hands up.

3500
02:57:06,140 --> 02:57:07,140
You're gonna grab your genitals.

3501
02:57:07,140 --> 02:57:08,620
I mean, give me a break.

3502
02:57:08,620 --> 02:57:10,340
What will you not put up with?

3503
02:57:10,340 --> 02:57:13,820
Now they're saying you can't have home gardens again.

3504
02:57:13,820 --> 02:57:15,220
That's up on Drudge.

3505
02:57:15,220 --> 02:57:16,220
Mainstream news.

3506
02:57:16,220 --> 02:57:17,900
The media is like, it's good to ban gardens.

3507
02:57:17,900 --> 02:57:18,900
We agree with it.

3508
02:57:18,900 --> 02:57:19,900
Let's go ahead.

3509
02:57:19,900 --> 02:57:25,100
Alex, you can't have a garden, but you're in a free country cuz I'm a snot nose.

3510
02:57:25,100 --> 02:57:26,100
Let's go back to snot nose.

3511
02:57:26,100 --> 02:57:27,100
Here it is.

3512
02:57:27,100 --> 02:57:30,900
The Second Amendment permits for reasonable regulation, for prevention of people like

3513
02:57:30,900 --> 02:57:35,820
him from getting guns, for prevention of crazy people with long records, criminal records

3514
02:57:35,820 --> 02:57:36,880
from getting guns.

3515
02:57:36,880 --> 02:57:42,260
We have to do more to fulfill what the real meaning of the Second Amendment is.

3516
02:57:42,260 --> 02:57:46,260
Reasonable access to guns for self protection and for hunting.

3517
02:57:46,260 --> 02:57:51,100
And there's no room in America for these semi-automatic, automatic, and other kinds of weapons that

3518
02:57:51,100 --> 02:57:54,340
are simply designed to create mass havoc.

3519
02:57:54,340 --> 02:57:58,420
And they go on to say, I don't need this platform either cuz they've decided the First Amendment's

3520
02:57:58,420 --> 02:57:59,420
bad too.

3521
02:57:59,420 --> 02:58:04,940
You know, when they search your house without warrants, they go, well, we find it reasonable.

3522
02:58:04,940 --> 02:58:09,500
The whole thing says reasonable is oath or affirmation with witnesses with the particular

3523
02:58:09,500 --> 02:58:11,080
things to be searched.

3524
02:58:11,080 --> 02:58:14,360
And no person, place, or things will be touched without that warrant.

3525
02:58:14,360 --> 02:58:17,180
And no unreasonable search and seizure without that.

3526
02:58:17,180 --> 02:58:19,420
The Second Amendment says shall not be entrenched.

3527
02:58:19,420 --> 02:58:24,780
And it's very clear, I mean, he just sits there, you're a lawyer.

3528
02:58:24,780 --> 02:58:31,340
Wait, wait, wait, let's go out with Dershowitz, here he is, candid video.

3529
02:58:31,340 --> 02:58:42,380
Here's a cough drop, bye-bye Dershowitz, bye-bye cupcake, bye-bye, bye-bye, go back to England.

3530
02:58:42,380 --> 02:58:47,980
Thank you for listening to GCN, visit GCNlive.com today.

3531
02:58:47,980 --> 02:58:55,500
You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.

3532
02:58:55,500 --> 02:59:00,340
Tyranny is here, the grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.

3533
02:59:00,340 --> 02:59:03,060
It really says that the state is God.

3534
02:59:03,060 --> 02:59:07,620
The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most impressive police states

3535
02:59:07,620 --> 02:59:08,840
on earth.

3536
02:59:08,840 --> 02:59:13,660
This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being

3537
02:59:13,660 --> 02:59:15,500
expanded nationwide.

3538
02:59:15,500 --> 02:59:19,660
This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all

3539
02:59:19,660 --> 02:59:21,600
powerful shadow state.

3540
02:59:21,600 --> 02:59:25,620
Police state four chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.

3541
02:59:25,620 --> 02:59:31,780
Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship, body scammers, sound cameras,

3542
02:59:31,780 --> 02:59:35,860
citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.

3543
02:59:35,860 --> 02:59:39,380
It's only the beginning of the new world order's hellish plan.

3544
02:59:39,380 --> 02:59:42,460
The police state isn't coming, it's here.

3546

Mystic Coast, direct from Austin, you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.

3547
03:00:22,340 --> 03:00:35,140
We're back live, ladies and gentlemen, it is Tuesday, the eighth day of January 2013.

3548
03:00:35,140 --> 03:00:40,380
I have engaged the red coat usurper at point blank range in the Infowars.

3549
03:00:40,380 --> 03:00:46,200
His response is to call for my platform and first amendment to be removed immediately

3550
03:00:46,200 --> 03:00:52,180
while simultaneously claiming that I am violating his first amendment as the White House responded

3551
03:00:52,180 --> 03:01:02,900
to sacrosanct, the sacrosanctity of free expression when we dip crucifix in urine or have five

3552
03:01:02,900 --> 03:01:08,060
year olds talk about things at public school that adults didn't know 20 years ago.

3553
03:01:08,060 --> 03:01:15,420
But if you want to say government should be kept in line, I say you're an enemy of the

3554
03:01:15,420 --> 03:01:16,420
queen.

3555
03:01:16,420 --> 03:01:20,420
All right, enough of me, I've got a bunch of news coming up, let's go to, and more clips,

3556
03:01:20,420 --> 03:01:26,220
I haven't gotten to our debate part yet in three plus hours already, Tony in Tennessee,

3557
03:01:26,220 --> 03:01:28,860
are you intimidated by my accent?

3558
03:01:28,860 --> 03:01:33,300
No, as a matter of fact, I love it, man.

3559
03:01:33,300 --> 03:01:34,300
Good.

3560
03:01:34,300 --> 03:01:35,300
You pathetic Tennessean.

3561
03:01:35,300 --> 03:01:44,460
Well, I'm a transplant now, I've been a long time listener since 98 and first time caller

3562
03:01:44,460 --> 03:01:48,660
and I saw the show last night and I thought it was, I thought you hit it out of the park,

3563
03:01:48,660 --> 03:01:49,660
man.

3564
03:01:49,660 --> 03:01:55,180
I didn't do anything you could have done any different, except ask Piers Morgan if he would

3565
03:01:55,180 --> 03:01:57,740
have been groom of the stool.

3566
03:01:57,740 --> 03:02:01,020
But if he had done that, I probably wouldn't be here today because I would have dropped

3567
03:02:01,020 --> 03:02:02,020
dead laughing.

3568
03:02:02,020 --> 03:02:05,700
Well, I gotta be honest with you, I was gonna say at the end, listen, why don't you go back

3569
03:02:05,700 --> 03:02:19,180
to England and groom Queen Elizabeth II's stool and the opportunities for comedic value

3570
03:02:19,180 --> 03:02:21,940
that I dropped the ball on, I wanna apologize.

3571
03:02:21,940 --> 03:02:26,940
I think you hit most points that you had to hit and you had such a short time in which

3572
03:02:26,940 --> 03:02:27,940
to do it.

3573
03:02:27,940 --> 03:02:32,100
That's what most people that are critical of you, like what I heard this morning on

3574
03:02:32,100 --> 03:02:37,300
the show that comes on before you, people are saying, Alex should have done this and

3575
03:02:37,300 --> 03:02:39,260
Alex should have done that.

3576
03:02:39,260 --> 03:02:44,540
But nobody goes up there into the belly of the beast and does it themselves.

3577
03:02:44,540 --> 03:02:48,700
Alex should have built his own media system, Alex should have worked 18 hours a day for

3578
03:02:48,700 --> 03:02:53,020
17 years, Alex should have got on the airplane and dealt with it all and flown up there and

3579
03:02:53,020 --> 03:02:54,660
marched in there and done it.

3580
03:02:54,660 --> 03:02:59,860
I know it's a nation of spectators, but spectators have never mattered, what matters is people

3581
03:02:59,860 --> 03:03:00,860
that are in the arena.

3582
03:03:00,860 --> 03:03:06,440
Of other people that are, they want to have a spokesman, but then they're so critical

3583
03:03:06,440 --> 03:03:07,440
of them.

3584
03:03:07,440 --> 03:03:15,340
It's like, I'll just call it Joyce Riley, she's so jealous of you and she's still upset

3585
03:03:15,340 --> 03:03:20,740
because you wouldn't answer the phone when you had the John Burke Society on.

3586
03:03:20,740 --> 03:03:25,460
And she's so critical of what you did, well, yeah, he said this and that, but he shouldn't

3587
03:03:25,460 --> 03:03:26,460
have been this way.

3588
03:03:26,460 --> 03:03:30,500
Well, I don't really, I just really, I'm just not even really aware of even what you're

3589
03:03:30,500 --> 03:03:31,500
talking about.

3590
03:03:31,500 --> 03:03:34,460
I just think she's a wonderful person, does such a good job.

3591
03:03:34,460 --> 03:03:36,260
Thank you so much for the call.

3592
03:03:36,260 --> 03:03:41,020
I remember somebody, I don't think it was her called in, I remember when I had two minutes

3593
03:03:41,020 --> 03:03:47,140
left with McManus, they get him back on and they wanted to talk about something.

3594
03:03:47,140 --> 03:03:50,580
And then I think they thought I knew whatever that fight was, but I don't have time for

3595
03:03:50,580 --> 03:03:51,580
all this stuff.

3596
03:03:51,580 --> 03:03:56,320
I mean, I don't have time to spend time with my children most of the time, much less know

3597
03:03:56,320 --> 03:03:58,460
what other people are doing.

3598
03:03:58,460 --> 03:04:04,540
I worry about Dianne Feinstein with a bill that will confiscate my guns.

3599
03:04:04,540 --> 03:04:14,660
I worry about poisons in the vaccines on record that are turning our kids into just basically

3600
03:04:14,660 --> 03:04:16,780
brain damage minions of the New World Order.

3601
03:04:16,780 --> 03:04:22,780
I mean, I worry about stuff that I can warn people about, that we can do something about.

3602
03:04:22,780 --> 03:04:28,500
And yes, there will be absolute conniptions in the so-called alternative media, not about

3603
03:04:28,500 --> 03:04:35,300
who you were mentioning, who's just salt to the earth, but others, because some people

3604
03:04:35,300 --> 03:04:37,540
are not in this fight to defeat the globalists.

3605
03:04:37,540 --> 03:04:41,360
Some people are here to be stars.

3606
03:04:41,360 --> 03:04:48,940
And I don't do this from a perspective of ego or monetary gain.

3607
03:04:48,940 --> 03:04:55,820
I do it from a perspective of instinct, spirit, intellect, and drive, an absolute love of

3608
03:04:55,820 --> 03:04:56,820
liberty.

3609
03:04:56,820 --> 03:04:57,820
We'll be back.

3610
03:04:57,820 --> 03:04:58,820
More calls coming up.

3611
03:04:58,820 --> 03:04:59,820
Hello, I'm Alex Jones.

3612
03:04:59,820 --> 03:05:09,020
Myself, my family, the Infowars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we

3613
03:05:09,020 --> 03:05:14,020
are intensifying our efforts against the globalist on every front.

3614
03:05:14,020 --> 03:05:19,660
Infowars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats, but we can't do that without

3615
03:05:19,660 --> 03:05:20,660
your help.

3616
03:05:20,660 --> 03:05:25,900
By getting the films, bumper stickers, and t-shirts at Infowars.com, you will wake up

3617
03:05:25,900 --> 03:05:31,940
people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.

3618
03:05:31,940 --> 03:05:35,400
We need your help to spread the word like never before.

3619
03:05:35,400 --> 03:05:41,620
They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.

3620
03:05:41,620 --> 03:05:49,060
You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization

3621
03:05:49,060 --> 03:05:50,820
and ultimate extermination.

3622
03:05:50,820 --> 03:05:52,980
The war is here.

3623
03:05:52,980 --> 03:05:54,820
It's an info war.

3624
03:05:54,820 --> 03:06:01,220
The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.

3625
03:06:01,220 --> 03:06:04,960
Who wants to be disease-free, full of energy, and vibrant health?

3626
03:06:04,960 --> 03:06:09,060
Two reasons you may feel constantly tired and run down could be that your body's acid

3627
03:06:09,060 --> 03:06:11,660
level is high and your pH level is low.

3628
03:06:11,660 --> 03:06:13,340
How does acid enter your body?

3629
03:06:13,340 --> 03:06:18,500
A cup of coffee, a sandwich, tap water, stress, and cell phones, plus your own body produces

3630
03:06:18,500 --> 03:06:20,060
acid on a regular basis.

3631
03:06:20,060 --> 03:06:24,900
AlkaVision plasma pH drops alkalize the water you drink and raise your pH level.

3632

3659
03:08:22,220 --> 03:08:28,580
All right, I promise I'm going to get to round one and two with Aaron Dykes in here.

3660
03:08:28,580 --> 03:08:31,500
I haven't even gotten into this in three plus hours of broadcast today.

3661
03:08:31,500 --> 03:08:34,020
Thank you for joining us.

3662
03:08:34,020 --> 03:08:37,260
Of the Piers Morgan interview, he's back tonight.

3663
03:08:37,260 --> 03:08:41,900
They're saying now it just may be Alex Jones forever until the show is canceled.

3664
03:08:41,900 --> 03:08:45,060
And that's starting to come out that he may be moved to a later slot than let go in a

3665
03:08:45,060 --> 03:08:49,220
year because people are rejecting the snot nose.

3666
03:08:49,220 --> 03:08:55,220
And again, people in England are great, folks, Ireland, Scotland.

3667
03:08:55,220 --> 03:09:02,460
It's the establishment imperial snot noses talking down to us that we're sick of.

3668
03:09:02,460 --> 03:09:08,060
And we've got to rediscover that disgust of elitism and care about people because of their

3669
03:09:08,060 --> 03:09:13,060
merits and what they stand for and what they've done, not because of what class they're from.

3670
03:09:13,060 --> 03:09:17,300
That's what really made America different from Europe and why it became the model of

3671
03:09:17,300 --> 03:09:18,300
the world.

3672
03:09:18,300 --> 03:09:19,300
Not that we were perfect.

3673
03:09:19,300 --> 03:09:24,060
We were hypocrites in many ways, but those ideas then sprung forth and grew, and then

3674
03:09:24,060 --> 03:09:26,060
we became decadent.

3675
03:09:26,060 --> 03:09:29,780
Liberty and the Second Amendment built this country.

3676
03:09:29,780 --> 03:09:33,420
Let's go to your phone calls, Brad in California, you're on the air.

3677
03:09:33,420 --> 03:09:41,340
Yo, Alex, brother, I really dig what you did last night and I appreciate you for doing

3678
03:09:41,340 --> 03:09:42,340
that.

3679
03:09:42,340 --> 03:09:44,140
I really like the content that you provided.

3680
03:09:44,140 --> 03:09:47,540
However, I would say that the presentation was a little over the top.

3681
03:09:47,540 --> 03:09:52,300
And I'm here in Sonoma County, like liberal haven.

3682
03:09:52,300 --> 03:09:57,380
And I can tell you these people are like frothing at the mouth pissed off and really motivated

3683
03:09:57,380 --> 03:10:00,220
to kind of come take all of our guns because of what you did last night.

3684
03:10:00,220 --> 03:10:02,460
What do you guys say about that, bro?

3685
03:10:02,460 --> 03:10:05,340
No, it's my fault they're coming after our guns.

3686
03:10:05,340 --> 03:10:12,140
It was my fault 237 years ago when they came to take the guns at Lexington and Concord,

3687
03:10:12,140 --> 03:10:13,140
I did it.

3688
03:10:13,140 --> 03:10:18,180
Cuz I got a time machine last night cuz I was on Piers Morgan and I went back and Hitler

3689
03:10:18,180 --> 03:10:26,940
took the guns and Stalin and Lenin and Mao and Fidel Castro, they all took the guns because

3690
03:10:26,940 --> 03:10:28,500
I went on Piers Morgan last night.

3691
03:10:28,500 --> 03:10:31,060
It's my fault all these bills are introduced.

3692
03:10:31,060 --> 03:10:35,860
That's right, that's the other spin that's being put out that I should have been polite

3693
03:10:35,860 --> 03:10:40,240
and let him put out a bunch of false statistics and say there weren't London riots and say

3694
03:10:40,240 --> 03:10:43,460
there wasn't a giant crime increase in England after they took their guns.

3695
03:10:43,460 --> 03:10:49,460
I should have just laid down quietly and been calm and taken it from the authoritarians

3696
03:10:49,460 --> 03:10:53,500
that call themselves liberals that are now collapsing the great state of California.

3697
03:10:53,500 --> 03:10:54,500
I agree with you.

3698
03:10:54,500 --> 03:10:59,340
You do, well, I didn't think you would agree with me, but then again, I don't know.

3699
03:10:59,340 --> 03:11:05,260
No, no, I'm pretty powerful, dude, I mean, I'm the reason they're coming for our guns,

3700
03:11:05,260 --> 03:11:06,260
you're right.

3701
03:11:06,260 --> 03:11:08,980
Well, I didn't say that, but anyways, I'm saying that-

3702
03:11:08,980 --> 03:11:15,300
No, no, you said they're frothing mad because they finally got told they're a bunch of authoritarians

3703
03:11:15,300 --> 03:11:18,460
and that the drugs they're putting people on, by the way, put him on hold.

3704
03:11:18,460 --> 03:11:21,020
I wanna show these articles right here.

3705
03:11:21,020 --> 03:11:23,900
I haven't even tooted my horn today on this.

3706
03:11:23,900 --> 03:11:29,340
I told you Holmes was clearly in a Defense Department program and that's all come out.

3707
03:11:29,340 --> 03:11:31,380
There were multiple shooters reported.

3708
03:11:31,380 --> 03:11:38,100
The guy had a mask on, but they had witnesses last night saying it was Holmes running around.

3709
03:11:38,100 --> 03:11:45,100
Look at this, Aurora theater shooting cops took pill bottles from Holmes apartment.

3710
03:11:45,100 --> 03:11:49,240
Aurora police seized four prescription bottles and immunization records.

3711
03:11:49,240 --> 03:11:53,320
They searched the theater shooting suspects James Holmes apartment in July according to

3712
03:11:53,320 --> 03:11:56,460
newly obtained filings in the murder case against Holmes.

3713
03:11:56,460 --> 03:12:02,340
Well, the disclosure come in back and forth between prosecutors and defense attorneys.

3714
03:12:02,340 --> 03:12:06,140
And it goes on, he's charged with 166 counts of murder, attempted murder.

3715
03:12:06,140 --> 03:12:10,780
Really killed 166 people and that's interesting, I thought it was 14.

3716
03:12:10,780 --> 03:12:17,220
But continuing here, I've got another article here, what this is WorldNetDaily, let me show

3717
03:12:17,220 --> 03:12:19,220
you this article.

3718
03:12:19,220 --> 03:12:24,460
The gigantic gaping hole in Sandy Hook reporting.

3719
03:12:24,460 --> 03:12:29,620
And then it goes on to basically break down that they're reporting on different news outlets,

3720
03:12:29,620 --> 03:12:35,940
60 Minutes that yes, these are confirmed that he was indeed on psychotropic drugs, wow.

3721
03:12:35,940 --> 03:12:42,460
So Aurora and Sandy Hook, I mean, I'll be honest, I've never seen a real mass shooting.

3722
03:12:42,460 --> 03:12:45,780
They call it mass shooting when gangs shoot and kill each other and 10 people die.

3723
03:12:45,780 --> 03:12:50,060
And they're usually on cocaine or something, but the point is these people are on drugs

3724
03:12:50,060 --> 03:12:53,340
that are shown to make you do this.

3725
03:12:53,340 --> 03:12:57,320
Like Aaron said earlier, people all the time like themselves on fire, chop their babies

3726
03:12:57,320 --> 03:12:58,320
up with meat cleavers.

3727
03:12:58,320 --> 03:13:03,340
You'll read, Texas woman chops three children's arms and legs off.

3728
03:13:03,340 --> 03:13:07,020
You're like, man, and the cops, it was in the news, they go, well, we went to the medicine

3729
03:13:07,020 --> 03:13:10,500
cabinet, she was on serotonin uptake inhibitors, we expected that.

3730
03:13:10,500 --> 03:13:14,740
Yeah, women don't chop their baby's arms and legs off and their children with meat cleavers

3731
03:13:14,740 --> 03:13:21,260
or another Texas woman drowned four of her children on the drugs.

3732
03:13:21,260 --> 03:13:25,980
But I've got to turn my guns in because, and we need more money for mental health to put

3733
03:13:25,980 --> 03:13:28,180
more people on these.

3734
03:13:28,180 --> 03:13:33,460
And then Brad, he says that my performance has, they've already are taking your guns

3735
03:13:33,460 --> 03:13:36,080
in the legislature in California, what's left of them?

3736
03:13:36,080 --> 03:13:38,900
They're already trying everywhere.

3737
03:13:38,900 --> 03:13:43,440
But tell me, cuz it's not about how they're bad or getting in their face, it's my fault.

3738
03:13:43,440 --> 03:13:50,260
How should I have approached the authoritarians that call themselves liberal in California?

3739
03:13:50,260 --> 03:13:54,500
How do I present myself to them to get them to understand self-defense?

3740
03:13:54,500 --> 03:13:57,340
Tell me, Brad, you're on right now with Piz Morgan.

3741
03:13:57,340 --> 03:14:01,260
Okay, so imagine the show's starting with Piz Morgan, you're the man that wants to deport

3742
03:14:01,260 --> 03:14:05,300
me for my views on the Second Amendment.

3743
03:14:05,300 --> 03:14:07,580
What do you say, Brad?

3744
03:14:07,580 --> 03:14:13,780
I would have said you should have been a little more like Ron Paul and just kind of acquiesced

3745
03:14:13,780 --> 03:14:14,780
a little bit.

3746
03:14:14,780 --> 03:14:15,780
You know, you know.

3747
03:14:15,780 --> 03:14:18,780
Yeah, you know, you know, that's it, right?

3748
03:14:18,780 --> 03:14:22,980
So just acquiesced a little bit, go all into the game, just a little bit, just to kind

3749
03:14:22,980 --> 03:14:27,300
of reach the more moderate people out there who are more on the fence.

3750
03:14:27,300 --> 03:14:31,660
Well you know, Ron Paul is there and we've supported Ron Paul, he's on tomorrow, but

3751
03:14:31,660 --> 03:14:32,660
I'm here.

3752
03:14:32,660 --> 03:14:34,660
And see, I do what I want.

3753
03:14:34,660 --> 03:14:37,100
And see, it's not all about a collective, okay?

3754
03:14:37,100 --> 03:14:40,860
I went in there with that red coat, I knew his playbook, and he disgusted me, so I got

3755
03:14:40,860 --> 03:14:41,860
in his face.

3756
03:14:41,860 --> 03:14:45,660
And it's scared, you know why they're scared, going, we'll get the guns, because they wanna

3757
03:14:45,660 --> 03:14:49,100
dominate us and they know we're waking up, I appreciate your call.

3758
03:14:49,100 --> 03:14:51,220
So Brad, thank you.

3759
03:14:51,220 --> 03:14:57,180
Let's go ahead and talk to Laureen in New Hampshire, thanks for holding her on the air,

3760
03:14:57,180 --> 03:14:58,180
Laureen.

3761
03:14:58,180 --> 03:14:59,180
Hi, Alex.

3762
03:14:59,180 --> 03:15:00,180
Welcome.

3763
03:15:00,180 --> 03:15:01,180
Can you hear me?

3764
03:15:01,180 --> 03:15:02,180
I'm sure, absolutely.

3765
03:15:02,180 --> 03:15:06,920
See, what happens is if I say hello, you're when you go on air, and then if I don't say

3766
03:15:06,920 --> 03:15:09,600
hello again, then I always cut you off.

3767
03:15:09,600 --> 03:15:13,100
So I don't know how to do that, I'm not a good talk show host, I've never figured that

3768
03:15:13,100 --> 03:15:14,100
out.

3769
03:15:14,100 --> 03:15:16,040
And I go, hello, you're on the air, and they always go, hello, hello.

3770
03:15:16,040 --> 03:15:20,860
But as soon as I talk and say yes, you're on, then I talk over you, but go ahead.

3771
03:15:20,860 --> 03:15:27,100
Okay, I disagree with Brad, I think that you're not responsible whatsoever.

3772
03:15:27,100 --> 03:15:33,180
I think people have been conditioned to be socially polite and not show emotion.

3773
03:15:33,180 --> 03:15:36,980
And I think with everything that's happening in this country, how could you not get up

3774
03:15:36,980 --> 03:15:40,740
there and show emotion when they're taking our rights away?

3775
03:15:40,740 --> 03:15:48,180
The founders had a war over seven years, and hundreds of thousands died.

3776
03:15:48,180 --> 03:15:49,340
Imagine how bad they are.

3777
03:15:49,340 --> 03:15:54,340
I mean, I'm bad raising my voice to a liar who wants my rights, when I should have just

3778
03:15:54,340 --> 03:15:59,020
been over right there on the table for him, I guess, according to them.

3779
03:15:59,020 --> 03:16:00,460
Imagine if that's bad.

3780
03:16:00,460 --> 03:16:04,740
How bad is George Washington or Patrick Henry?

3781
03:16:04,740 --> 03:16:08,620
He said, give me liberty or give me death, and he wanted to say, I'm gonna fight you

3782
03:16:08,620 --> 03:16:10,740
to the death.

3783
03:16:10,740 --> 03:16:15,060
The war has already begun, why stand we here idle?

3784
03:16:15,060 --> 03:16:19,420
Aren't you ashamed, like Pierce says, he says Americans are shameful, says he's come here

3785
03:16:19,420 --> 03:16:21,140
to conquer us, that's a quote.

3786
03:16:21,140 --> 03:16:29,020
And I agree with him, I'm ashamed, I wanna suck the snot out of his big snot filled beak

3787
03:16:29,020 --> 03:16:30,020
of power.

3788
03:16:30,020 --> 03:16:33,660
I'm actually intimidated by how powerful he is.

3789
03:16:33,660 --> 03:16:38,620
I'm actually intimidated by the sycophantic voice, and I wanna kneel to him like the Queen

3790
03:16:38,620 --> 03:16:43,900
of England, and I wanna just grovel to his fake facade.

3791
03:16:43,900 --> 03:16:50,460
How dare you, how dare you say we should even raise our voices to our gods?

3792
03:16:50,460 --> 03:16:53,380
I'm sorry, ma'am, I'm sorry to talk about my secret dreams.

3793
03:16:53,380 --> 03:17:00,020
No, I just think that people, a lot of people don't know how to take a real person showing

3794
03:17:00,020 --> 03:17:01,020
real emotions anymore.

3795
03:17:01,020 --> 03:17:06,420
I think we've been that dumbed down and conditioned.

3796
03:17:06,420 --> 03:17:12,760
Years ago they wanted to put my son when he was nine years old on a whole bunch of medication

3797
03:17:12,760 --> 03:17:18,020
because of behavior issues, because he was bored in school, I ended up homeschooling

3798
03:17:18,020 --> 03:17:19,020
him.

3799
03:17:19,020 --> 03:17:24,580
I actually had the psychiatrist tell me I would be responsible if my son hurt someone

3800
03:17:24,580 --> 03:17:27,620
because I didn't put him on the medication.

3801
03:17:27,620 --> 03:17:33,340
And I then replied, will you be responsible if I put my son on the medication and he still

3802
03:17:33,340 --> 03:17:34,340
hurt someone?

3803
03:17:34,340 --> 03:17:36,580
And he turned red in the face and did not say anything.

3804
03:17:36,580 --> 03:17:40,220
Yeah, folks do that cuz they lie and say it's the law to take vaccines, it's the law to

3805
03:17:40,220 --> 03:17:42,460
go on Ritalin or Prozac or whatever.

3806
03:17:42,460 --> 03:17:47,460
They have forums on sites that say, okay, you take responsibility now for what's on

3807
03:17:47,460 --> 03:17:49,300
the insert.

3808
03:17:49,300 --> 03:17:52,780
It's all about how they intimidate you and then they get money.

3809
03:17:52,780 --> 03:17:59,700
Put my son on any of the medication and then he wrote up a false report saying I was a

3810
03:17:59,700 --> 03:18:03,060
negligent mother not caring about her son.

3811
03:18:03,060 --> 03:18:04,060
And it was just the opposite.

3812
03:18:04,060 --> 03:18:05,060
I mean, I realized-

3813
03:18:05,060 --> 03:18:06,060
Were they able to take your son?

3814
03:18:06,060 --> 03:18:08,820
So if you don't put them on drugs, they kidnap them and then drug them.

3815
03:18:08,820 --> 03:18:09,820
What happened?

3816
03:18:09,820 --> 03:18:13,020
Well, thank God they didn't do that, but I hear what you're saying, it happens enough.

3817
03:18:13,020 --> 03:18:14,020
That's right.

3818
03:18:14,020 --> 03:18:18,180
A lot of it's diet, it's what's in the air, the allergies are exploding, they're killing

3819
03:18:18,180 --> 03:18:19,180
us.

3820
03:18:19,180 --> 03:18:20,180
God bless you, ma'am.

3821
03:18:20,180 --> 03:18:21,180
I'm sorry, go ahead.

3822
03:18:21,180 --> 03:18:26,860
Yeah, they take away their recess and they don't get an outlet during the day for fresh

3823
03:18:26,860 --> 03:18:27,860
air.

3824
03:18:27,860 --> 03:18:28,860
It's incredible.

3825
03:18:28,860 --> 03:18:30,180
God bless you, ma'am.

3826
03:18:30,180 --> 03:18:34,380
Let's go to Herb in Georgia, a XM 166 listener.

3827
03:18:34,380 --> 03:18:35,380
You're on the air, sir.

3828
03:18:35,380 --> 03:18:36,380
Thanks for holding.

3829
03:18:36,380 --> 03:18:37,380
Alex, how you doing?

3830
03:18:37,380 --> 03:18:41,500
Well, I just worship Piers Morgan.

3831
03:18:41,500 --> 03:18:45,500
Like I said, the fact that he speaks with a snot nose, it's just I worship it.

3832
03:18:45,500 --> 03:18:49,860
We should have a giant, the Washington monuments should be replaced with Piers Morgan's nose

3833
03:18:49,860 --> 03:18:58,060
and then like a wave pool or lazy river of snot, and then we just, I mean, doesn't that

3834
03:18:58,060 --> 03:18:59,060
sound good?

3835
03:18:59,060 --> 03:19:04,460
Alex, I told you not to do it, but you went ahead and did it, you went ahead and did it.

3836
03:19:04,460 --> 03:19:06,460
I told you not to go out there, Mr. Sosa.

3837
03:19:06,460 --> 03:19:11,980
Now you know what's going to happen now, Alex, Mr. Sosa, he wants to take us to war now.

3838
03:19:11,980 --> 03:19:14,380
Well, I'm having trouble understanding you, sir.

3839
03:19:14,380 --> 03:19:19,140
Are you jealous that I am the first person to recommend a new worldwide cult worshiping

3840
03:19:19,140 --> 03:19:22,180
with snot of the snot filled nose of Piers Morgan?

3841
03:19:22,180 --> 03:19:24,540
No, Alex, let me finish, Alex.

3842
03:19:24,540 --> 03:19:25,540
You know what?

3843
03:19:25,540 --> 03:19:35,380
I told you when you had the lady on with the agenda 21 thing, Alex, these people are begging

3844
03:19:35,380 --> 03:19:43,140
the citizens of the United States for a violent uprising and this is, this is, this is what

3845
03:19:43,140 --> 03:19:44,140
they're doing, Alex.

3846
03:19:44,140 --> 03:19:45,140
This is what they're doing.

3847
03:19:45,140 --> 03:19:46,140
No, no, no.

3848
03:19:46,140 --> 03:19:48,140
We don't want, they're going to try to come for us.

3849
03:19:48,140 --> 03:19:50,500
We want to kill these gun bills so that doesn't happen.

3850
03:19:50,500 --> 03:19:51,500
Let's stay there.

3851
03:19:51,500 --> 03:19:53,780
I'll come back to you.

3852
03:19:53,780 --> 03:19:54,780
He's a serious caller.

3853
03:19:54,780 --> 03:20:01,180
He, he may have gazed into the nostrils of Piers Morgan, the all knowing snout, the Oracle.

3854
03:20:01,180 --> 03:20:06,780
Injuries, slow healing, aches and pains, constipation, weakness, fatigue are all common the older

3855
03:20:06,780 --> 03:20:07,780
one gets.

3856
03:20:07,780 --> 03:20:11,420
The progressive deterioration of the body that occurs almost universally the older one

3857
03:20:11,420 --> 03:20:17,060
gets can partly to significantly be prevented with conscientious attention to nutrition.

3858
03:20:17,060 --> 03:20:21,300
If the Hanza men can play rugby in their nineties, then it is possible for everyone in North

3859
03:20:21,300 --> 03:20:24,320
America to experience a more youthful life as well.

3860
03:20:24,320 --> 03:20:28,500
One key ingredient to warding off aging and reversing some of it is the type and quality

3861
03:20:28,500 --> 03:20:29,940
of protein consumed.

3862
03:20:29,940 --> 03:20:34,100
All protein foods or supplements you currently consume are heat damaged, destroying fifty

3863
03:20:34,100 --> 03:20:39,060
to seventy-five percent of your ability to utilize the body building amino acids.

3864
03:20:39,060 --> 03:20:43,460
One World Whey is not heat damaged and allows your body to utilize one hundred percent of

3865
03:20:43,460 --> 03:20:44,780
the amino acids.

3866
03:20:44,780 --> 03:20:47,160
This feat no one else has achieved.

3867
03:20:47,160 --> 03:20:50,060

We can buy GMOs stressed out about money and blasted by the electric environment.

3872
03:21:05,500 --> 03:21:10,320
Hi, I'm Pastor Jenny and that was the state I was in back in two thousand and ten.

3873
03:21:10,320 --> 03:21:12,300
Then I learned about RNA drops.

3874
03:21:12,300 --> 03:21:16,840
I learned that ninety-seven percent of my DNA that scientists have called junk is actually

3875
03:21:16,840 --> 03:21:21,060
packed with millions of gene switches that play a critical role in controlling how my

3876
03:21:21,060 --> 03:21:23,940
cells, organs and other tissues behave.

3877
03:21:23,940 --> 03:21:27,940
I learned I don't have to put up with disease decay or decline like I've been conditioned

3878
03:21:27,940 --> 03:21:28,940
to believe.

3879
03:21:28,940 --> 03:21:33,500
I began taking RNA drops, a one hundred percent natural formula designed to turn on those

3880
03:21:33,500 --> 03:21:36,900
switches and provide me with amazing health and joy.

Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

3894
03:22:31,540 --> 03:22:35,340
Have you ever wondered why banks, stock workers, investment advisors won't talk about gold

3895
03:22:35,340 --> 03:22:36,340
IRAs?

3896
03:22:36,340 --> 03:22:40,340
They've been available since 1986 yet the financial industry won't recognize the value

3897
03:22:40,340 --> 03:22:42,020
of gold for your retirement.

3898
03:22:42,020 --> 03:22:45,500
Gold is outperformed paper investments yet no word about IRAs.

3899

Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.

3902
03:23:00,340 --> 03:23:05,340
Looking back on 2012 we ask ourselves how did we ever survive from natural disasters

3903
03:23:05,340 --> 03:23:09,940
like hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on

3904
03:23:09,940 --> 03:23:11,780
by a disastrous economy.

3905
03:23:11,780 --> 03:23:14,500
Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything.

3906
03:23:14,500 --> 03:23:18,700
At eFoods Direct we hear from customers every day that are fortunate enough to weather life's

3907
03:23:18,700 --> 03:23:21,220
storm by having a supply of food on hand.

3908
03:23:21,220 --> 03:23:25,780
After hurricane Sandy, Danny from New York City wrote, almost all of the grocery stores

3909
03:23:25,780 --> 03:23:30,580
are closed but I managed to get my eFoods just in time to be able to help my sister

3910
03:23:30,580 --> 03:23:31,580
and niece.

3911
03:23:31,580 --> 03:23:35,380
It is better to be prepared 10 years too early than one day too late.

3912
03:23:35,380 --> 03:23:37,620
I can warn you but I can't feed you.

3913
03:23:37,620 --> 03:23:39,980

3918
03:24:14,140 --> 03:24:33,220
I hurt myself today to see if I still feel, I focus on the pain, the only thing that's

3919
03:24:33,220 --> 03:24:34,220
real.

3920
03:24:34,220 --> 03:24:41,180
The needle tears a hole, the old familiar sting.

3921
03:24:41,180 --> 03:24:51,300
The old familiar sting, try to kill it, try to kill it all away, but I remember, but I

3922
03:24:51,300 --> 03:24:52,300
remember everything.

3923
03:24:52,300 --> 03:25:06,340
What have I become, what have I become, my sweetest friend, my sweetest friend.

3924
03:25:06,340 --> 03:25:15,620
Everything I know, everyone I know, disappears and goes away, goes away, in the end.

3925
03:25:15,620 --> 03:25:21,260
And you can have it all CNN's dirty empire of dirt.

3926
03:25:21,260 --> 03:25:27,220
I will let you in, my empire of dirt.

3927
03:25:27,220 --> 03:25:33,180
I will bring you down, I will let you down.

3928
03:25:33,180 --> 03:25:37,660
I will make you hurt, I will make you hurt.

3929
03:25:37,660 --> 03:25:40,740
That's all they offer is more hurt and still more hurt.

3930
03:25:40,740 --> 03:25:46,060
All right, Herb and Georgia, just try to settle down cuz you're over driving your phone and

3931
03:25:46,060 --> 03:25:47,540
I have trouble understanding what you're saying.

3932
03:25:47,540 --> 03:25:53,300
I got the part about, they wanna cause a violent revolution, I've been saying that.

3933
03:25:53,300 --> 03:25:59,340
But they want to pass laws and then go pick gun owners off one at a time and call us terrorist.

3934
03:25:59,340 --> 03:26:00,700
That's the script, they now admit it.

3935
03:26:00,700 --> 03:26:03,940
So we're saying, no, you're not getting it, they're freaking out right now.

3936
03:26:03,940 --> 03:26:09,780
Cuz even though they're milking this whole thing and scripting it, it's not working.

3937
03:26:09,780 --> 03:26:11,100
And they're just imploding.

3938
03:26:11,100 --> 03:26:16,420
No one trusts them, no one likes them, even their own people are out buying guns now.

3939
03:26:16,420 --> 03:26:17,420
So it's over.

3940
03:26:17,420 --> 03:26:21,140
The question is how bad will the collapse be, but their days are numbered.

3941
03:26:21,140 --> 03:26:25,060
Most billionaires and real insider globalists that are crooks have already left the United

3942
03:26:25,060 --> 03:26:26,260
States years ago.

3943
03:26:26,260 --> 03:26:28,660
They're all hiding out in parts of the world with our own bodyguards.

3944
03:26:28,660 --> 03:26:32,700
And when the time comes, their bodyguards are just gonna string them up.

3945
03:26:32,700 --> 03:26:34,540
And I'm not happy about that either.

3946
03:26:34,540 --> 03:26:37,180
I don't want instability, I don't want any of this.

3947
03:26:37,180 --> 03:26:46,180
I'm just not gonna sit there while some redcoat gets in my face and tells me I'm his slave.

3948
03:26:46,180 --> 03:26:49,260
So does that answer your question there, Herb, or what are you getting at?

3949
03:26:49,260 --> 03:26:55,020
Well, what I'm getting at is you've got all the white papers, but they've left a paper

3950
03:26:55,020 --> 03:26:56,020
tray of Alex.

3951
03:26:56,020 --> 03:27:04,420
They've gone up with 9-11, the Patriot Act, the NDAA, the H.R. 1955 violent radicalization

3952
03:27:04,420 --> 03:27:05,820
homegrown terrorism act.

3953
03:27:05,820 --> 03:27:08,340
This is what they're getting at.

3954
03:27:08,340 --> 03:27:10,380
And I don't wanna get overly excited, but-

3955
03:27:10,380 --> 03:27:14,320
Good, but when they blow up buildings, we'll point out they did it.

3956
03:27:14,320 --> 03:27:18,740
When they come for us, they're gonna do it anyways, so we might as well get in a position

3957
03:27:18,740 --> 03:27:19,740
to defend.

3958
03:27:19,740 --> 03:27:23,140
And let me tell you, let me tell you, there's been a lot of times crooks have tried to take

3959
03:27:23,140 --> 03:27:26,540
over and have reached too far and failed.

3960
03:27:26,540 --> 03:27:27,540
Go ahead.

3961
03:27:27,540 --> 03:27:33,780
Now Alex, I heard that Gregory recently, please get him on this show, because he laid it out

3962
03:27:33,780 --> 03:27:41,100
that this, the latest shooting up there in Connecticut, it was CIA all the way.

3963
03:27:41,100 --> 03:27:44,740
And I would love for you to have him on this show to talk about that.

3964
03:27:44,740 --> 03:27:51,380
Now this clown was talking about you was comparing George W. Bush to Adolf Hitler.

3965
03:27:51,380 --> 03:27:53,820
I guess they must think we're damn crazy.

3966
03:27:53,820 --> 03:27:59,140
George W. Bush's grandfather aided Adolf Hitler in this damn rise to power.

3967
03:27:59,140 --> 03:28:01,140
So what do they think we're doing?

3968
03:28:01,140 --> 03:28:02,140
What do they think we're doing?

3969
03:28:02,140 --> 03:28:03,140
You know what terrifies these people, Alex?

3970
03:28:03,140 --> 03:28:07,140
When the media come in, and this whole damn country is lit up with armed citizens, that

3971
03:28:07,140 --> 03:28:08,140
terrifies these maggots, Alex.

3972
03:28:08,140 --> 03:28:09,140
That terrifies these maggots.

3973
03:28:09,140 --> 03:28:10,140
And you know what?

3974
03:28:10,140 --> 03:28:21,580
You took down Crap News Network, and the whole damn so-called media is collapsing, and the

3975
03:28:21,580 --> 03:28:26,460
reason it's collapsing is because it's all about the globalists, and we don't give a

3976
03:28:26,460 --> 03:28:27,460
damn about the globalists.

3977
03:28:27,460 --> 03:28:28,460
It's our country, and we're gonna continue to run these damn red coats out.

3978
03:28:28,460 --> 03:28:29,460
If they don't leave, we're gonna run your ass out, and that's exactly what we oughta

3979
03:28:29,460 --> 03:28:30,460
do.

3980
03:28:30,460 --> 03:28:31,460
And all those straight-ass white boys out of California need to leave, and for God's

3981
03:28:31,460 --> 03:28:44,340
sake, don't go down to Texas, cuz you get shot in the ass, they're out of control.

3982
03:28:44,340 --> 03:28:49,340
Man, Herb, you're something else, man, I love it.

3983
03:28:49,340 --> 03:28:52,620
I don't wanna shoot anybody, I wanna shoot them with info and wake them up.

3984
03:28:52,620 --> 03:28:56,180
It's all part of this sniveling, it's like junior high.

3985
03:28:56,180 --> 03:29:00,260
It's like, you didn't do it perfectly, I'm better.

3986
03:29:00,260 --> 03:29:06,620
I would be embarrassed putting people down that are trying to do good, so I felt big.

3987
03:29:06,620 --> 03:29:11,180
See, I don't even wanna put the globalists down, because they're in power.

3988
03:29:11,180 --> 03:29:14,740
I'm trying to put them down cuz they're bad people and are enemies.

3989
03:29:14,740 --> 03:29:20,300
And I agree with you, listen, they are scared now, and I don't mean to get gross here on

3990
03:29:20,300 --> 03:29:21,300
air.

3991
03:29:21,300 --> 03:29:26,500
I thought they had done this to the CNN bathroom on purpose.

3992
03:29:26,500 --> 03:29:30,660
Their employees looked like they'd been run over, they were all bummed out.

3993
03:29:30,660 --> 03:29:34,020
Just a couple years ago I was there, it looked run down, but they had more of a spring in

3994
03:29:34,020 --> 03:29:35,020
their step.

3995
03:29:35,020 --> 03:29:37,880
When I was there like five, six years ago, and then ten years ago, they thought they

3996
03:29:37,880 --> 03:29:38,880
were God.

3997
03:29:38,880 --> 03:29:45,420
I mean, I know a used up cesspit when I see it.

3998
03:29:45,420 --> 03:29:49,060
By the way, I just sent it out to the real Alex Jones on Twitter, what Piers Morgan wants

3999
03:29:49,060 --> 03:29:50,060
to do in England.

4000
03:29:50,060 --> 03:29:54,140
We're on the march, the empire's on the run.

4001
03:29:54,140 --> 03:30:01,380
Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

4002
03:30:01,380 --> 03:30:05,580
On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth

4003
03:30:05,580 --> 03:30:08,100
to retire and live out their golden years.

4004
03:30:08,100 --> 03:30:13,140
Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many

4005
03:30:13,140 --> 03:30:16,160
retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.

4006
03:30:16,160 --> 03:30:19,780
Is this a flaw of free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve

4007
03:30:19,780 --> 03:30:24,380
Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?

4008
03:30:24,380 --> 03:30:28,140
These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature

4009
03:30:28,140 --> 03:30:29,660
from Jekyll Island.

4010
03:30:29,660 --> 03:30:33,540
Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank

4011
03:30:33,540 --> 03:30:38,540
power, a gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.

4012
03:30:38,540 --> 03:30:39,980

4031
03:31:59,420 --> 03:32:03,900
Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the bestselling book, Cancer Step Outside the

4032
03:32:03,900 --> 03:32:04,900
Box.

4033
03:32:04,900 --> 03:32:07,860
I want you to know some very important information.

4034
03:32:07,860 --> 03:32:12,660
In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White

4035
03:32:12,660 --> 03:32:16,980
House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.

4036
03:32:16,980 --> 03:32:22,540
Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.

4037
03:32:22,540 --> 03:32:27,620
Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally

4038
03:32:27,620 --> 03:32:32,760
occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single

4039
03:32:32,760 --> 03:32:33,900
normal cell.

4040
03:32:33,900 --> 03:32:37,660
If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune

4041
03:32:37,660 --> 03:32:41,660
cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.

4042
03:32:41,660 --> 03:32:49,580

4044
03:32:56,940 --> 03:33:01,780
Protect your immune system, it's the only one you've got.

4045
03:33:01,780 --> 03:33:07,500
You walk into this room at your own risk because it leads to the future, not a future that

4046
03:33:07,500 --> 03:33:10,380
will be but one that might be.

4047
03:33:10,380 --> 03:33:16,340
This is not a new world, it is simply an extension of what began in the old one.

4048
03:33:16,340 --> 03:33:21,140
It has patterned itself after every dictator who has ever planted the ripping imprint of

4049
03:33:21,140 --> 03:33:24,900
a boot on the pages of history since the beginning of time.

4050
03:33:24,900 --> 03:33:31,380
It has refinements, technological advances and a more sophisticated approach to the destruction

4051
03:33:31,380 --> 03:33:33,500
of human freedom.

4052
03:33:33,500 --> 03:33:39,620
But like every one of the super states that preceded it, it has one iron rule, logic is

4053
03:33:39,620 --> 03:33:41,620
an enemy and truth is a menace.

4054
03:34:09,620 --> 03:34:14,340
Ron Paul is on tomorrow.

4055
03:34:14,340 --> 03:34:20,900
Piers Morgan versus Alex Jones on gun control, who won wild debate, Christian Science Monitor,

4056
03:34:20,900 --> 03:34:25,640
social media buzz over Piers Morgan versus Alex Jones, CNN, Daily Beast, Alex Jones prime

4057
03:34:25,640 --> 03:34:26,640
time meltdown.

4058
03:34:26,640 --> 03:34:31,100
I mean, I had a guy on there saying the London riots didn't happen and he said that I said

4059
03:34:31,100 --> 03:34:35,780
George Bush blew up the towers.

4060
03:34:35,780 --> 03:34:38,100
And they asked me, they said, did George Bush blow up the towers?

4061
03:34:38,100 --> 03:34:39,100
What does it have to do with the gun debate?

4062
03:34:39,100 --> 03:34:42,900
And I just said, look, man, they staged all the talk and all these other events.

4063
03:34:42,900 --> 03:34:44,780
Our government has been caught running Al-Qaeda.

4064
03:34:44,780 --> 03:34:46,700
I mean, that's in the news.

4065
03:34:46,700 --> 03:34:48,660
And I go, and he goes, really?

4066
03:34:48,660 --> 03:34:51,700
So I'm like, well, yeah, I gave him all these examples of false flags.

4067
03:34:51,700 --> 03:34:56,360
But he changed the subject cuz I'm like, hey, here's the FBI crime statistics, 20 plus percent

4068
03:34:56,360 --> 03:34:59,420
drop in violent crime as gun ownership goes up here.

4069
03:34:59,420 --> 03:35:02,260
But the gun, what gun was used?

4070
03:35:02,260 --> 03:35:04,520
What gun, he just want me to answer my questions.

4071
03:35:04,520 --> 03:35:05,520
This is a debate.

4072
03:35:05,520 --> 03:35:11,380
And he wasn't answering my questions because I said, look at my numbers and I said England's

4073
03:35:11,380 --> 03:35:12,380
crime rate tripled.

4074
03:35:12,380 --> 03:35:20,620
Here's an article out of England Daily Telegraph, telegraph.co, UK is violent crime capital

4075
03:35:20,620 --> 03:35:21,620
of Europe.

4076
03:35:21,620 --> 03:35:24,620
And it had statistics, everybody knows that.

4077
03:35:24,620 --> 03:35:26,720
Switzerland has the lowest crime rate.

4078
03:35:26,720 --> 03:35:29,060
He was scared to death of that, Aaron.

4079
03:35:29,060 --> 03:35:31,980
Other points before we go to calls, cuz I know you've been wound up about what's happening.

4080
03:35:31,980 --> 03:35:35,660
Well, that caller earlier said it, he got a taste of his own medicine by meeting you

4081
03:35:35,660 --> 03:35:36,980
face to face.

4082
03:35:36,980 --> 03:35:38,420
But what gun was used?

4083
03:35:38,420 --> 03:35:42,700
The coroner's report doesn't match the news report when it comes to the Sandy Hook incident.

4084
03:35:42,700 --> 03:35:47,980
All they know is what we're told in the media and it becomes this ritualized mass murder

4085
03:35:47,980 --> 03:35:48,980
scenes.

4086
03:35:48,980 --> 03:35:55,260
Vigna Brzezinski talked about in his Technotronic era book from the 70s, how violence becomes

4087
03:35:55,260 --> 03:35:58,460
routinized, how conflict becomes routinized.

4088
03:35:58,460 --> 03:36:02,540
We're used to just seeing these wars escalate at various locales in the Middle East.

4089
03:36:02,540 --> 03:36:07,100
We don't even need to know the name of the country or where it is on the map.

4090
03:36:07,100 --> 03:36:09,060
Organized crime gangs become normal.

4091
03:36:09,060 --> 03:36:13,300
No, no, he says in the Anglo-American establishment in between two ages, right?

4092
03:36:13,300 --> 03:36:16,780
Cuz I haven't read it in about a decade, but I know you just recently read them.

4093
03:36:16,780 --> 03:36:19,420
He admits we the elite run organized crime.

4094
03:36:19,420 --> 03:36:20,900
Yeah, he says it.

4095
03:36:20,900 --> 03:36:23,620
And the whole point is they're pushing crime on TV.

4096
03:36:23,620 --> 03:36:26,740
This is a top one of their, they all write books how they run it.

4097
03:36:26,740 --> 03:36:30,020
They brag and then when you say you have the info, they go, that book doesn't exist.

4098
03:36:30,020 --> 03:36:32,140
I'm like, well, here's your book right here.

4099
03:36:32,140 --> 03:36:37,540
Remember what Gary Hart did, where he wrote that letter saying we staged all these terror

4100
03:36:37,540 --> 03:36:38,540
attacks.

4101
03:36:38,540 --> 03:36:39,540
He goes, no, I didn't.

4102
03:36:39,540 --> 03:36:40,540
Well, here's the letter.

4103
03:36:40,540 --> 03:36:41,540
He goes, God.

4104
03:36:41,540 --> 03:36:44,620
He was like, you guys know about, he was so used to the public, just blind.

4105
03:36:44,620 --> 03:36:46,540
It was like a vampire at high noon.

4106
03:36:46,540 --> 03:36:51,380
It's a mind trick and we're acclimated to hearing the president's soothing words after

4107
03:36:51,380 --> 03:36:56,180
a tragedy from hearing these news anchors lecture us on what to do in response when

4108
03:36:56,180 --> 03:36:57,640
they have no clue.

4109
03:36:57,640 --> 03:37:00,940
It doesn't correlate crime and gun violence.

4110
03:37:00,940 --> 03:37:02,620
Look at Kennesaw, Georgia.

4111
03:37:02,620 --> 03:37:07,260
Look at all the people defending their homes against invaders and you name it.

4112
03:37:07,260 --> 03:37:12,140
But the reason they bring up stuff like 9-11, Alex, as you well know, your viewership, people

4113
03:37:12,140 --> 03:37:16,980
who are awake out there know that the story isn't answered on 9-11 and are outraged that

4114
03:37:16,980 --> 03:37:20,700
leaders like George Bush grandstand and say they hate us for their freedoms when they're

4115
03:37:20,700 --> 03:37:22,300
trying to strip our freedoms.

4116
03:37:22,300 --> 03:37:26,820
But the brain dead viewers who just tuned into TV, it's a short circuit, this guy's

4117
03:37:26,820 --> 03:37:29,720
crazy 9-11 tune out to what he's saying.

4118
03:37:29,720 --> 03:37:33,420
And so they're trying to split the audience using that kind of mind trick.

4119
03:37:33,420 --> 03:37:34,940
That's what I think about the 9-11 thing.

4120
03:37:34,940 --> 03:37:35,940
I agree with you.

4121
03:37:35,940 --> 03:37:38,380
Before we go back to calls, you probably wanna get some headsets once we do that.

4122
03:37:38,380 --> 03:37:41,980
I'm sorry I called you in here and then didn't tell you we're gonna go to calls.

4123
03:37:41,980 --> 03:37:48,700
We should probably, Aaron, talk about the fact that they're all over the news saying

4124
03:37:48,700 --> 03:37:49,900
I need to be shut down.

4125
03:37:49,900 --> 03:37:51,260
I shouldn't have a platform.

4126
03:37:51,260 --> 03:37:55,420
And Dershowitz and them going, I don't think, and CNN, other shows, I mean, I was out there

4127
03:37:55,420 --> 03:37:56,420
earlier.

4128
03:37:56,420 --> 03:37:58,180
They're playing like the whole interview again right now.

4129
03:37:58,180 --> 03:38:02,720
They're acting like this is the end of the world, I guess, to rally their Soviet forces

4130
03:38:02,720 --> 03:38:05,700
or something that look, the scary man said government's bad.

4131
03:38:05,700 --> 03:38:10,240
We all know government's our mommy, government's the big pink milky in the sky that we all

4132
03:38:10,240 --> 03:38:12,980
get our yum yums from.

4133
03:38:12,980 --> 03:38:18,100
And I'm sorry, the government is not the pink milky in the sky, it's the cyanide milky in

4134
03:38:18,100 --> 03:38:19,100
the sky.

4135
03:38:19,100 --> 03:38:21,660
And I mean, what do you say to these people?

4136
03:38:21,660 --> 03:38:25,420
Well, we've seen them time and again try to come with the fairness doctrine, try to shut

4137
03:38:25,420 --> 03:38:27,220
down their opposition.

4138
03:38:27,220 --> 03:38:30,500
They've got these targeted lists that have come out through various presidents over the

4139
03:38:30,500 --> 03:38:32,300
years.

4140
03:38:32,300 --> 03:38:34,380
This federal government is power tripping.

4141
03:38:34,380 --> 03:38:37,380
They're so bought out that they think they're the bosses.

4142
03:38:37,380 --> 03:38:40,580
And when they hear somebody say otherwise, it doesn't compute.

4143
03:38:40,580 --> 03:38:45,620
All they know how to do is call for them to be shut down, try to throw random statistics

4144
03:38:45,620 --> 03:38:48,500
in your face as if they know better.

4145
03:38:48,500 --> 03:38:54,340
And that was my point in saying Piers Morgan should be deported for his, not seditious

4146
03:38:54,340 --> 03:38:56,340
as he's not a citizen.

4147
03:38:56,340 --> 03:39:01,540
But for his subversion inside our republic, and then of course there's court cases to

4148
03:39:01,540 --> 03:39:02,540
back that up.

4149
03:39:02,540 --> 03:39:04,640
But they didn't want me getting on there with Dershowitz.

4150
03:39:04,640 --> 03:39:08,500
But again, I told them before the show goes they want me deported and I go no and I told

4151
03:39:08,500 --> 03:39:14,780
your producers this was done just as a tongue in cheek thing to show our displeasure with

4152
03:39:14,780 --> 03:39:15,900
you a foreigner here.

4153
03:39:15,900 --> 03:39:20,900
You could be doing a movie review show or something, or you could be doing a show on

4154
03:39:20,900 --> 03:39:21,900
other social issues.

4155
03:39:21,900 --> 03:39:25,220
But you start coming here and telling us that we're bad and we're scum.

4156
03:39:25,220 --> 03:39:29,140
There's new articles out where he's bragging that we're stupid Americans.

4157
03:39:29,140 --> 03:39:33,380
And I mean, come on, dude, just cuz you got a snot filled nose doesn't mean I gotta bow

4158
03:39:33,380 --> 03:39:34,820
down to you.

4159
03:39:34,820 --> 03:39:38,780
And you don't wanna shut down the CFR just because they say seditious and horrible things.

4160
03:39:38,780 --> 03:39:43,540
But at the same time, if they're truly undermining amendments, truly starting wars, we've got

4161
03:39:43,540 --> 03:39:44,700
a show where that's being done.

4162
03:39:44,700 --> 03:39:47,820
Well, yeah, maybe we should get to that point cuz they're calling for us to be arrested.

4163
03:39:47,820 --> 03:39:53,420
How about, because here's the deal, you have free speech until you call to overthrow the

4164
03:39:53,420 --> 03:39:56,500
legitimate government bill of rights and constitution.

4165
03:39:56,500 --> 03:40:01,180
And if you read the CFR's public stuff, as you said, in the family, in everything, fund

4166
03:40:01,180 --> 03:40:05,360
al-Qaeda, and they're the ones influencing the ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center that

4167
03:40:05,360 --> 03:40:07,420
are saying arrest us.

4168
03:40:07,420 --> 03:40:10,900
So in a way, we're being nice going, okay, you've got your free speech, you're like,

4169
03:40:10,900 --> 03:40:12,780
that's right, now arrest them.

4170
03:40:12,780 --> 03:40:19,060
You've gotta get to the point of realizing the White House top advisors in FBI recorded

4171
03:40:19,060 --> 03:40:23,560
documented trials, people went to jail, wanted to put 50 million of us in a forced labor

4172
03:40:23,560 --> 03:40:25,580
camp and kill half of us.

4173
03:40:25,580 --> 03:40:29,140
And Aaron, you've been around here that time we had that Soviet here, and we didn't know,

4174
03:40:29,140 --> 03:40:31,200
we thought it was for an interview on something else.

4175
03:40:31,200 --> 03:40:34,740
And the person's like, I can't wait till the Soviet, till our communism takes over and

4176
03:40:34,740 --> 03:40:35,740
we're gonna get everybody.

4177
03:40:35,740 --> 03:40:39,900
And I mean, they say it everywhere, their religion is raping our wives and bashing our

4178
03:40:39,900 --> 03:40:40,900
brains out.

4179
03:40:40,900 --> 03:40:45,780
Yeah, I mean, that stuff is, it's creepy.

4180
03:40:45,780 --> 03:40:46,780
What can you say?

4181
03:40:46,780 --> 03:40:50,060
These are nobody's, I mean, they're all about I'm gonna run a big government.

4182
03:40:50,060 --> 03:40:54,340
You're gonna build it, you're gonna pay for it, you're gonna design it with your smarts,

4183
03:40:54,340 --> 03:40:58,660
and then I'm gonna sit up here on top of it calling the shots.

4184
03:40:58,660 --> 03:41:02,860
It appears Morgan and these other people on TV saying these things were legitimately concerned

4185
03:41:02,860 --> 03:41:04,820
about the dead children and the violence.

4186
03:41:04,820 --> 03:41:08,180
They would say, look, this is awful, how do we curb it, but let's not throw out the baby

4187
03:41:08,180 --> 03:41:12,780
with the bathwater, cuz we see what happens when people get disarmed, when countries become

4188
03:41:12,780 --> 03:41:15,040
too authoritarian, too centralized.

4189
03:41:15,040 --> 03:41:18,980
But they're not having that debate, they're being disingenuous, they're aware of that

4190
03:41:18,980 --> 03:41:20,020
information.

4191
03:41:20,020 --> 03:41:24,020
They're aware of the reason about the Second Amendment, but they're just playing the audience

4192
03:41:24,020 --> 03:41:29,140
as stupid and ignoring those facts and acting like if you ban guns, it'll stop violence.

4193
03:41:29,140 --> 03:41:33,020
Lanza was reportedly refused from buying guns, he took them from his mother.

4194
03:41:33,020 --> 03:41:34,020
No-

4195
03:41:34,020 --> 03:41:35,020
Five times.

4196
03:41:35,020 --> 03:41:36,020
One of these laws-

4197
03:41:36,020 --> 03:41:43,420
If any of that, some of these shows, like the RT show, was like, Alex Jones and people

4198
03:41:43,420 --> 03:41:45,220
say there's multiple shooters.

4199
03:41:45,220 --> 03:41:49,060
Those were five-year-olds that saw that, no, it's helicopter video.

4200
03:41:49,060 --> 03:41:50,900
It's on record and they won't say who got arrested.

4201
03:41:50,900 --> 03:41:54,700
I heard the police dispatches, they're talking about two shadows running by, how they have

4202
03:41:54,700 --> 03:41:57,060
the one guy detained, but there's others and they're-

4203
03:41:57,060 --> 03:41:59,700
That's police, it's not five-year-olds.

4204
03:41:59,700 --> 03:42:03,700
But again, when I watch these shows, cuz I'm trying to give my audience the truth, I'm

4205
03:42:03,700 --> 03:42:08,020
trying to get it right, even when you wanna tell the truth, you get stuff wrong sometimes.

4206
03:42:08,020 --> 03:42:09,440
Well, of course, yeah.

4207
03:42:09,440 --> 03:42:13,060
But I mean, I watch these shows, it's all the art, like, you're on the in crowd, you

4208
03:42:13,060 --> 03:42:18,660
know how to go in and lie to people and misrepresent, and it's just people are sick of it.

4209
03:42:18,660 --> 03:42:25,660
And it doesn't matter if, see, Piers Morgan and all them call their viewers lemmings behind

4210
03:42:25,660 --> 03:42:26,660
the scenes.

4211
03:42:26,660 --> 03:42:31,460
But see, I go out and say, hey, you're a lemming viewer, see, I'm here saying I don't respect

4212
03:42:31,460 --> 03:42:32,460
you.

4213
03:42:32,460 --> 03:42:37,660
Take Forbes right here, Alex Jones spins Piers Morgan appearance, I don't respect that show.

4214
03:42:37,660 --> 03:42:41,900
So implying that I'm on the defensive, I'm on the defensive, I'm the number one Twitter

4215
03:42:41,900 --> 03:42:43,660
term in the world right now.

4216
03:42:43,660 --> 03:42:47,820
I'm on the defensive, we got like five links at the biggest website in the world, drudgereport.com.

4217
03:42:47,820 --> 03:42:51,300
I'm on the defensive, I'm on the offense.

4218
03:42:51,300 --> 03:42:55,980
What you don't get is I don't mind having my character attacked, I don't mind being

4219
03:42:55,980 --> 03:42:59,100
savage, just spell my name right.

4220
03:42:59,100 --> 03:43:03,780
If I wanted to go play patty cake with Piers, I could have gone on and groveled to him and

4221
03:43:03,780 --> 03:43:08,140
acted scared and kind of agreed and fumbled.

4222
03:43:08,140 --> 03:43:10,220
And then, will you come back on tomorrow?

4223
03:43:10,220 --> 03:43:11,860
Will you be on all the CNN shows?

4224
03:43:11,860 --> 03:43:14,220
I don't wanna be on the CNN shows.

4225
03:43:14,220 --> 03:43:19,660
I went to New York to hammer that red coat, and I told her, I said, look, I know you're

4226
03:43:19,660 --> 03:43:23,460
gonna have victims families, I know he's gonna attack me, I know he's gonna pull up factoid

4227
03:43:23,460 --> 03:43:24,460
statistics.

4228
03:43:24,460 --> 03:43:28,420
And I said, I'm gonna be nice, but the minute he does that, I'm dropping the hammer.

4229
03:43:28,420 --> 03:43:29,420
I mean, I was even honest.

4230
03:43:29,420 --> 03:43:33,300
I tell the globalist when I'm coming somewhere, hey, I'm gonna sneak into Bohemian Grove next

4231
03:43:33,300 --> 03:43:35,300
week in 2000, did it?

4232
03:43:35,300 --> 03:43:39,060
I'm coming back the next time, I mean, I just do that.

4233
03:43:39,060 --> 03:43:42,900
And they don't seem to get that you're a shadow of what you were.

4234
03:43:42,900 --> 03:43:47,520
The only time Forbes gets readers now is when they analyze the UN treaty correctly and point

4235
03:43:47,520 --> 03:43:49,740
out it goes after our guns.

4236
03:43:49,740 --> 03:43:54,560
Now this new guy says, Alex Jones, the only man willing to speak the truth, this journalist

4237
03:43:54,560 --> 03:43:56,660
like me are all working for the CIA.

4238
03:43:56,660 --> 03:44:01,180
No, you were selected for your psychological profile out of college and your college papers

4239
03:44:01,180 --> 03:44:06,120
and were watched as a sycophant that's limited and buys into the paradigm.

4240
03:44:06,120 --> 03:44:11,700
The key to globalist control is departmentalization, but you are too full of yourself.

4241
03:44:11,700 --> 03:44:15,620
Man, local radio hosts are always calling me wanting to come on their shows.

4242
03:44:15,620 --> 03:44:19,460
But the few times I do, they're completely arrogant and it's all about dissing me.

4243
03:44:19,460 --> 03:44:24,100
See, if they were even worldly and smart, Aaron, they would be nice to me.

4244
03:44:24,100 --> 03:44:28,580
But they're that dumb though, it's all about the illusion that they've got all this power.

4245
03:44:28,580 --> 03:44:30,540
Let me tell you how much power you got.

4246
03:44:30,540 --> 03:44:34,980
Life's five minutes long, before you know it, you're gonna be on a fricking respirator.

4247
03:44:34,980 --> 03:44:38,700
What matters is our species and going to the next level.

4248
03:44:38,700 --> 03:44:40,660
Stop obsessing on yourselves all day.

4249
03:44:40,660 --> 03:44:42,020
I'm sorry, go ahead, Aaron.

4250
03:44:42,020 --> 03:44:45,860
Speaking of shadows of our former selves, they've gone after the guns cuz it's easy.

4251
03:44:45,860 --> 03:44:50,740
No one wants to have the larger debate about how they've debased our entire society with

4252
03:44:50,740 --> 03:44:54,760
all these electronics, the TV shows, and of course, the prescription medications.

4253
03:44:54,760 --> 03:44:59,840
You brought it up on the show, all of CNN's sponsors, it is dizzying to watch those commercial

4254
03:44:59,840 --> 03:45:00,840
breaks with a little-

4255
03:45:00,840 --> 03:45:03,020
May cause suicide, mass murder, blah, blah, blah.

4256
03:45:03,020 --> 03:45:07,180
Nobody wants to talk about how the Quayle family owns Eli Lilly, how they essentially

4257
03:45:07,180 --> 03:45:12,380
own the vice presidency, major pharmaceutical companies, how they're all in collaboration.

4258
03:45:12,380 --> 03:45:17,300
How they tried to sneak in vaccine exemption under the Patriot Act statutes so that they

4259
03:45:17,300 --> 03:45:20,900
couldn't get sued for damaging children, which they admit to.

4260
03:45:20,900 --> 03:45:22,780
No one wants to have this bigger-

4261
03:45:22,780 --> 03:45:26,140
It says this pill makes you commit suicide or mass murder.

4262
03:45:26,140 --> 03:45:27,140
When we say-

4263
03:45:27,140 --> 03:45:31,500
It says these pills make you do this, and then it just came out today.

4264
03:45:31,500 --> 03:45:33,180
Both shooters, like I said, on the drugs.

4265
03:45:33,180 --> 03:45:38,140
Well, no kidding, they're under psychiatric care and have that same cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs

4266
03:45:38,140 --> 03:45:39,140
stare.

4267
03:45:39,140 --> 03:45:44,180
I mean, I don't need to be a rocket scientist, and again, DARPA funding and a mind control

4268
03:45:44,180 --> 03:45:48,580
program, Theodore Kaczynski, LA Times, was under MK Ultra.

4269
03:45:48,580 --> 03:45:52,460
That's like, he was MK Ultra, but he bombed all that on his own, Aaron.

4270
03:45:52,460 --> 03:45:56,900
When we come on the show and say it's a scientific dictatorship and we're under the psychological

4271
03:45:56,900 --> 03:46:00,120
domination, it's written, but it's actually happening.

4272
03:46:00,120 --> 03:46:01,420
No one wants to admit to that.

4273
03:46:01,420 --> 03:46:05,300
And Brzezinski's like, we run the narcotics, we run the mass murder operations, we control

4274
03:46:05,300 --> 03:46:09,140
every level of organized crime in our scientific technochronic age.

4275
03:46:09,140 --> 03:46:12,260
We will destroy you, you will be nothing but vassals, we reduce your population.

4276
03:46:12,260 --> 03:46:16,220
There, let me write four books saying this, but it doesn't exist.

4277
03:46:16,220 --> 03:46:20,220
Piers Morgan and all them read this, they know this, and they traffic and grovel to

4278
03:46:20,220 --> 03:46:23,780
these guys at parties in New York.

4279
03:46:23,780 --> 03:46:28,260
That's a disgusting group of- That's what I mean, we take it as routine conflict that

4280
03:46:28,260 --> 03:46:30,020
these guys dominate us.

4281
03:46:30,020 --> 03:46:34,740
We know that system's there, but nobody wants to just own up to that we're under a scientific

4282
03:46:34,740 --> 03:46:38,440
dictatorship that we must dismantle and take power away from.

4283
03:46:38,440 --> 03:46:41,020
Because they're the ones that are mentally ill.

4284
03:46:41,020 --> 03:46:44,740
And how real honorable men and women would never build something like this.

4285
03:46:44,740 --> 03:46:48,780
You've had the people who made the documentaries about the psychotropic drugs on, Michael Moore

4286
03:46:48,780 --> 03:46:51,020
admitted it concerning Columbine.

4287
03:46:51,020 --> 03:46:55,020
You probably have brothers and sisters and cousins as I do, who you've seen turn into

4288
03:46:55,020 --> 03:46:58,300
people that they aren't really supposed to be because they're-

4289
03:46:58,300 --> 03:47:02,900
In the Chinese slave labor camps, they give them anti-psychotics and the people can't

4290
03:47:02,900 --> 03:47:03,900
even talk.

4291
03:47:03,900 --> 03:47:07,980
It's like a Disney movie, The Black Hole, where they lobotomize the people to be the

4292
03:47:07,980 --> 03:47:08,980
quote robots.

4293
03:47:08,980 --> 03:47:15,420
I mean, we're buying Apple products with people jumping into suicide nets, but it's okay cuz

4294
03:47:15,420 --> 03:47:18,620
Al Gore is a liberal.

4295
03:47:18,620 --> 03:47:21,980
Al Gore is a monster.

4296
03:47:21,980 --> 03:47:26,700
One violent video game that one person plays is what it is, it's not that big of a deal.

4297
03:47:26,700 --> 03:47:30,180
But how do we become a society where everybody wants to play these shooter games?

4298
03:47:30,180 --> 03:47:34,940
Where it consumes our entire after hours, our culture, where it's the thing to do after

4299
03:47:34,940 --> 03:47:35,940
watching television.

4300
03:47:35,940 --> 03:47:39,700
You now have all these games where you torture zombies, and really they're just people.

4301
03:47:39,700 --> 03:47:43,660
And they're women, they're men, you have the power and you torture them.

4302
03:47:43,660 --> 03:47:47,320
That's what the real scientists do, is torture people.

4303
03:47:47,320 --> 03:47:52,020
They're letting you in to what they like to do, to turn our world into their world.

4304
03:47:52,020 --> 03:47:55,260
Yet the debate isn't what is that doing to our mind, the debate is which game has the

4305
03:47:55,260 --> 03:47:59,620
coolest graphics, which one has the boldest character, which one has the most extreme

4306
03:47:59,620 --> 03:48:00,620
kill count.

4307
03:48:00,620 --> 03:48:05,740
And I'm not saying anything bad about people who play those games, but overall it's transforming

4308
03:48:05,740 --> 03:48:07,500
society as all this stuff is.

4309
03:48:07,500 --> 03:48:10,260
They're not living in the real world.

4310
03:48:10,260 --> 03:48:13,340
Is Infowars.com up or are they taking it down?

4311
03:48:13,340 --> 03:48:18,220
RIT people said it's been the heaviest day of traffic on Infowars that we've ever seen.

4312
03:48:18,220 --> 03:48:19,900
It's right up there at the high watermark.

4313
03:48:19,900 --> 03:48:23,340
Well, it won't have that problem anymore if the site's dead.

4314
03:48:23,340 --> 03:48:24,780
Is the site dead?

4315
03:48:24,780 --> 03:48:27,940
Are you guys in there?

4316
03:48:27,940 --> 03:48:30,580
You've got the wrong URL in there actually.

4317
03:48:30,580 --> 03:48:31,580
Infowars.com?

4318
03:48:31,580 --> 03:48:32,580
Yeah.

4319
03:48:32,580 --> 03:48:35,580
Aaron, don't embarrass me on there.

4320
03:48:35,580 --> 03:48:38,420
The dear leader is never wrong, I'm joking.

4321
03:48:38,420 --> 03:48:41,980
They said they were in there like Starfleet commanders barely holding the site up, like

4322
03:48:41,980 --> 03:48:44,460
it was throttling, like about to give way and-

4323
03:48:44,460 --> 03:48:46,540
Starfleet commanders.

4324
03:48:46,540 --> 03:48:48,020
You know, Star Wars type metaphor.

4325
03:48:48,020 --> 03:48:50,980
No, I hear you, I like it, I like it.

4326
03:48:50,980 --> 03:48:55,620
Hey, let's go back to the calls here, I'm ready to go home and collapse.

4327
03:48:55,620 --> 03:48:59,820
You know the woods are lovely dark and deep, Aaron, but I got miles to go before I sleep.

4328
03:48:59,820 --> 03:49:03,420
I love this Forbes, this is another snot-nosed article.

4329
03:49:03,420 --> 03:49:07,380
They think cuz it's snot-nosed and all the other snot-noses go to like their snot-nosed

4330
03:49:07,380 --> 03:49:08,380
cult.

4331
03:49:08,380 --> 03:49:11,380
They go, where's snot-nosed?

4332
03:49:11,380 --> 03:49:14,940
I mean, literally, it's just like, we'll be snot-nosed.

4333
03:49:14,940 --> 03:49:19,940
There's no tyranny in America, they're not taking any of our rights, Alex Jones is bad.

4334
03:49:19,940 --> 03:49:23,020
Then they drink from Piers Morgan's snout.

4335
03:49:23,020 --> 03:49:26,940
Let's go to Adam in Minnesota, thanks for holding, sir, go ahead.

4336
03:49:26,940 --> 03:49:35,260
Oh, hey, I just wanted to thank you for what you did on CNN.

4337
03:49:35,260 --> 03:49:42,780
I couldn't believe it, I have a lot of anger in me, and I just couldn't believe somebody

4338
03:49:42,780 --> 03:49:45,820
went into that building and said those things.

4339
03:49:45,820 --> 03:49:48,020
I'm speechless right now.

4340
03:49:48,020 --> 03:49:56,420
Well, by the way, even though they're in literally like a rotting subterranean cave with feces

4341
03:49:56,420 --> 03:49:59,380
fustuting the walls, literally, it was filthy.

4342
03:49:59,380 --> 03:50:06,260
They are all still energized with the memory of their demonic power, I'm sorry, go ahead.

4343
03:50:06,260 --> 03:50:10,940
No, you're right, people need to wake up, these people are fake.

4344
03:50:10,940 --> 03:50:15,940
They're going to these places where these mass shootings are, wearing makeup.

4345
03:50:15,940 --> 03:50:18,940
Nobody's crying, the kids are dying.

4346
03:50:18,940 --> 03:50:24,380
We get to see Gaddafi get pulled out of a drainage, Saddam, we get to watch him get

4347
03:50:24,380 --> 03:50:25,380
shot.

4348
03:50:25,380 --> 03:50:30,980
What is it now, 60,000 people are now dead in Syria, we're not doing anything about it,

4349
03:50:30,980 --> 03:50:35,780
we're starting all this, all we want is oil, it's going to be a big joke.

4350
03:50:35,780 --> 03:50:40,860
I agree with the enemy, go to Infowars.com, member of Biden's gun control task force,

4351
03:50:40,860 --> 03:50:46,700
has a son convicted of planning a school mass murder, wonder where we should start our investigation

4352
03:50:46,700 --> 03:50:48,340
with who may have staged this.

4353
03:50:48,340 --> 03:50:53,980
Oh, the White House staged thousands of murders in Mexico and the US to get our guns, it all

4354
03:50:53,980 --> 03:50:58,280
came out, but they only ran false flags in the past they got caught for, Aaron.

4355
03:50:58,280 --> 03:51:00,500
They're not suspects now, they're good people.

4356
03:51:00,500 --> 03:51:07,180
Hello, I'm Alex Jones, myself, my family, the Infowars.com team want to relay to you

4357
03:51:07,180 --> 03:51:12,420
and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalist on every

4358
03:51:12,420 --> 03:51:13,420
front.

4359
03:51:13,420 --> 03:51:19,220
Infowars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats, but we can't do that without

4360
03:51:19,220 --> 03:51:25,220
your help by getting the films, bumper stickers and T-shirts at Infowars.com, you will wake

4361
03:51:25,220 --> 03:51:31,480
up people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.

4362
03:51:31,480 --> 03:51:34,940
We need your help to spread the word like never before.

4363
03:51:34,940 --> 03:51:41,140
They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.

4364
03:51:41,140 --> 03:51:48,600
You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization

4365
03:51:48,600 --> 03:51:50,180
and ultimate extermination.

4366
03:51:50,180 --> 03:52:02,160
The war is here, it's an Infowar, the spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.

4367
03:52:02,160 --> 03:52:06,660
Big business has discovered the preparedness market and that makes it difficult to know

4368
03:52:06,660 --> 03:52:08,860
where to go and who to trust.

Mypatriotsupply.com.

4381
03:52:58,940 --> 03:53:05,340
Hi, my name is Annette and due to menopause symptoms for nearly two years, I suffered

4382
03:53:05,340 --> 03:53:08,700
severe heart clashes which prevented me from sleeping all night.

4383
03:53:08,700 --> 03:53:13,020
It was so hard to work because I continued all day to have the hot flashes from hell.

4384
03:53:13,020 --> 03:53:18,980
I was exhausted and depleted after only three weeks on one world weight, I have no hot flashes

4385
03:53:18,980 --> 03:53:20,480
and I'm sleeping normally again.

4386
03:53:20,480 --> 03:53:23,260
I feel energized and strong.

4387
03:53:23,260 --> 03:53:24,580
This is an amazing product.

4388
03:53:24,580 --> 03:53:28,060
It is a little known fact that every single cell of your body is supposed to produce ten

4389
03:53:28,060 --> 03:53:34,160
percent of its protein content as glutathione but due to toxicity and aging, it does not.

4390
03:53:34,160 --> 03:53:38,340
Could glutathione be a missing factor in optimal cell function for your entire body?

4391
03:53:38,340 --> 03:53:42,180
If you restore the optimal glutathione levels in your cells, especially your glands and

4392
03:53:42,180 --> 03:53:45,420
organs, then as a result, your glands and organs work better.

4393
03:53:45,420 --> 03:53:48,180
Imagine the quality of life improvement you might have.

4394
03:53:48,180 --> 03:53:52,420
To order One World Way, call 888-988-3325.

That's oneworldwhey.com.

4397
03:53:58,140 --> 03:54:08,980
By the way, they're downloading stuff off our phones.

4398
03:54:08,980 --> 03:54:11,460
Those are our quick draw cameras.

4399
03:54:11,460 --> 03:54:17,540
The TSA confrontation leaving yesterday, that didn't intend to happen.

4400
03:54:17,540 --> 03:54:24,180
We're going to have the, some of the behind the scenes Piers Morgan stuff, if not tonight,

4401
03:54:24,180 --> 03:54:26,380
tomorrow, there's just a lot of footage.

4402
03:54:26,380 --> 03:54:29,940
I did go in there with the camera going at first and he's got some of the stuff where

4403
03:54:29,940 --> 03:54:35,340
I run up to Dershowitz as he's scurrying off and Lord Whelan, I'll be back tomorrow, arrested.

4404
03:54:35,340 --> 03:54:39,180
I'm running on about, I got about four hours sleep the other night and about two hours

4405
03:54:39,180 --> 03:54:40,180
last night.

4406
03:54:40,180 --> 03:54:41,180
So I'm good.

4407
03:54:41,180 --> 03:54:42,560
I'm just a little bit out of it.

4408
03:54:42,560 --> 03:54:46,300
So thanks for putting up with me.

4409
03:54:46,300 --> 03:54:54,540
Let's go to, I didn't even see Greg again, owner of KYAH, 540 AM there in Utah.

4410
03:54:54,540 --> 03:54:56,580
He had a quick point to make.

4411
03:54:56,580 --> 03:54:57,580
Go ahead.

4412
03:54:57,580 --> 03:54:58,580
You're on the air.

4413
03:54:58,580 --> 03:54:59,580
Thanks for holding.

4414
03:54:59,580 --> 03:55:00,580
Yeah, thank you.

4415
03:55:00,580 --> 03:55:04,700
You know, it's been a long time since I actually watched the jellyfish news network.

4416
03:55:04,700 --> 03:55:10,380
I mean, the key here is education.

4417
03:55:10,380 --> 03:55:13,860
I mean, and you can tell when you're dealing with this, when you present them with the

4418
03:55:13,860 --> 03:55:18,660
facts and they can't, they can't respond other than to try and kill the messenger.

4419
03:55:18,660 --> 03:55:19,660
It's just so obvious.

4420
03:55:19,660 --> 03:55:27,100
They've got a job, disarm the American people peers and you get $8 million.

4421
03:55:27,100 --> 03:55:28,460
That's his contract over three years.

4422
03:55:28,460 --> 03:55:29,460
And have you heard?

4423
03:55:29,460 --> 03:55:31,020
He may get the boot at CNN.

4424
03:55:31,020 --> 03:55:36,420
Oh, I guess things didn't go too well for red coat.

4425
03:55:36,420 --> 03:55:38,300
I had no idea that you were on for four hours.

4426
03:55:38,300 --> 03:55:41,340
We're going to have to change our schedule here and get you on for that fourth hour.

4427
03:55:41,340 --> 03:55:42,340
I had no idea.

4428
03:55:42,340 --> 03:55:48,140
I don't always, I did the fourth, I did three hours for like 14 years and then for a couple

4429
03:55:48,140 --> 03:55:49,580
of years I did four hours.

4430
03:55:49,580 --> 03:55:50,580
Some days I do it.

4431
03:55:50,580 --> 03:55:51,580
I don't do it every day.

4432
03:55:51,580 --> 03:55:59,020
Well, I have to talk to John when I get done here, but anyway, I, uh, I wanted to say that,

4433
03:55:59,020 --> 03:56:05,220
uh, you know, when you're dealing with these idiots, it becomes apparently clear when you

4434
03:56:05,220 --> 03:56:10,100
bring out the facts and they won't discuss them or they will come up with a twisted,

4435
03:56:10,100 --> 03:56:13,860
I mean, you can't, you can't avoid, they didn't almost arrest you.

4436
03:56:13,860 --> 03:56:16,460
By the way, there's a reason why they didn't arrest you.

4437
03:56:16,460 --> 03:56:19,980
It's because you know what your rights are and they didn't want to battle.

4438
03:56:19,980 --> 03:56:25,380
I mean, if I were to go on there to the TSA and they told me to take off my shirt, why

4439
03:56:25,380 --> 03:56:26,860
are you wearing those blue gloves?

4440
03:56:26,860 --> 03:56:31,380
And they say, well, to protect me for, okay, I just, I demand that same respect.

4441
03:56:31,380 --> 03:56:34,700
You put on a stir.

4442
03:56:34,700 --> 03:56:38,100
Yeah, your phone's breaking up, but no, no, no.

4443
03:56:38,100 --> 03:56:40,020
They wear shoes, they wear gloves.

4444
03:56:40,020 --> 03:56:42,700
They don't change them when they search you because they don't care.

4445
03:56:42,700 --> 03:56:45,860
Now the cops put their hands in your body with the same gloves.

4446
03:56:45,860 --> 03:56:47,860
It's not bad enough they're in our body.

4447
03:56:47,860 --> 03:56:49,580
Now it's the same gloves.

4448
03:56:49,580 --> 03:56:50,580
God bless you, brother.

4449
03:56:50,580 --> 03:56:51,580
Great points.

4450
03:56:51,580 --> 03:56:53,740
Thanks for carrying the show.

4451
03:56:53,740 --> 03:56:58,140
Let's go ahead and take one more call here.

4452
03:56:58,140 --> 03:57:06,580
Let's take a call from, how do you pronounce, P-A-O-L-O, Hallo, Hallo in California.

4453
03:57:06,580 --> 03:57:08,260
Go ahead listening on the free Android app.

4454
03:57:08,260 --> 03:57:09,260
Go ahead.

4455
03:57:09,260 --> 03:57:10,260
Hello, Alex.

4456
03:57:10,260 --> 03:57:11,260
How you guys doing?

4457
03:57:11,260 --> 03:57:13,500
I'm dead tired, brother, but it feels good.

4458
03:57:13,500 --> 03:57:16,220
Good satisfaction, stomping red coat enemies.

4459
03:57:16,220 --> 03:57:19,980
If our ancestors could drag big guns from Ticonderoga with their feet bleeding with

4460
03:57:19,980 --> 03:57:24,740
no shoes, 50 miles or whatever it was, then I can go without sleep.

4461
03:57:24,740 --> 03:57:25,740
I'm a wimp.

4462
03:57:25,740 --> 03:57:29,100
Well, I saw the show last night, excited.

4463
03:57:29,100 --> 03:57:34,460
I was flipping off Piers Morgan the whole time, but I've been trying to wake up my brother

4464
03:57:34,460 --> 03:57:35,460
to you.

4465
03:57:35,460 --> 03:57:36,460
He's got 15.

4466
03:57:36,460 --> 03:57:37,460
He's got his guns.

4467
03:57:37,460 --> 03:57:38,460
I got mine.

4468
03:57:38,460 --> 03:57:44,980
I'm a veteran, 10 years and what you said last night was everything that I've researched

4469
03:57:44,980 --> 03:57:45,980
and what you've said.

4470
03:57:45,980 --> 03:57:51,140
I've been listening for two years and you woke me up and everything this guy and Dershowitz,

4471
03:57:51,140 --> 03:57:54,300
oh my God, it was terrible.

4472
03:57:54,300 --> 03:57:58,460
Everything on that cartoon news network was just terrible and-

4473
03:57:58,460 --> 03:57:59,460
Hey, great point.

4474
03:57:59,460 --> 03:58:00,460
Yeah, go ahead.

4475
03:58:00,460 --> 03:58:05,900
He couldn't take your heat, but he was doing the same thing for weeks.

4476
03:58:05,900 --> 03:58:06,900
He couldn't take a heat.

4477
03:58:06,900 --> 03:58:10,260
I was trying to call Alex, Alex, Alex, man, he was a joke.

4478
03:58:10,260 --> 03:58:13,860
No, he hit the panic button and that's why they're panicking, running around like chickens

4479
03:58:13,860 --> 03:58:14,860
with their heads caught off.

4480
03:58:14,860 --> 03:58:18,900
Well, we may cancel the show and we're moving into later slot, but we're winning.

4481
03:58:18,900 --> 03:58:19,900
We're winning.

4482
03:58:19,900 --> 03:58:20,900
Alex is losing.

4483
03:58:20,900 --> 03:58:21,900
Oh yes.

4484
03:58:21,900 --> 03:58:22,900
World government's good, but it doesn't exist.

4485
03:58:22,900 --> 03:58:23,900
Aaron Dykes, final 10 seconds of comments.

4486
03:58:23,900 --> 03:58:25,740
Disarmament is a cake recipe.

4487
03:58:25,740 --> 03:58:29,340
They're missing the guns, the butter, but we're supposed to be polite about it as they

4488
03:58:29,340 --> 03:58:30,340
try to disarm us.

4489
03:58:30,340 --> 03:58:33,140
No, we need to get up in arms, upset that apple cart.

4490
03:58:33,140 --> 03:58:34,140
They're tyrants.

4491
03:58:34,140 --> 03:58:37,660
Send our articles and videos out, expose the red codes, defend the Republic.

4492
03:58:37,660 --> 03:58:38,740
The new world order's going down.

4493
03:58:38,740 --> 03:59:08,700
Good job, crew.
