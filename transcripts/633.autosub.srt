1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Air Jordan

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
Pray I have great respect for knowledge but now it's like I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:01:02,720
Dot-com

5
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:05,792
Alex

6
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:07,584
Jordans

7
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:17,568
Jordan is I

8
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:23,968
I wasn't never I have witnessed

9
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:25,248
2 as a

10
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:28,576
It's something that exists in the culture

11
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:34,976
It's a rat and it's got electric I remember gotta catch em all being something that people yell out of time

12
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:42,400
But I've never played any iteration of it

13
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:48,800
Giving it a shot. So far I'm a little ways in his name

14
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:50,080
I'm all of my Pokemon

15
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:53,152
After Infowars personalities

16
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:56,736
And it's been going great

17
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:03,648
Because I basically I'm trying to find what would you mind me

18
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:10,048
Sure sure sure sure we've got there's a bug like a cockroach kind of Pokemon

19
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:12,864
Want that Steve pieczenik never goes away

20
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,424
You can get rid of it cannot get rid of them

21
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:21,824
We've got a type

22
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,896
Yai

23
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:29,504
Perfect texted me that very very proud of yourself and I was like yeah

24
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:33,600
And then there's I found one

25
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:40,000
Mud murkrow a problem

26
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:40,768
Sounds right

27
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:47,168
I know them but I want Hillary Hillary I'm enjoying the

28
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:53,568
A little too much this aspect of the game that isn't even part of the game I did this on stardew Valley

29
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:56,384
Animals After

30
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,064
It would lead to some really funny things like my cow is named David Knight

31
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:08,416
Can you pick up milk David night right now

32
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:11,232
You've already milked him for what he's worth

33
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:13,792
All right sooner that's my ride. What do I do

34
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:18,144
My bracelet Dan is I finally saw a Joyride

35
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:23,264
Which is a special that Bobcat Goldthwait

36
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:26,592
After they were in a tragic car accident

37
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:27,872
They're really f***** him up

38
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:32,736
They were about to go on this little tour then they got into an accident and now they finally finished it

39
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:34,016
And it's just great

40
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:36,576
It's just really great to very very funny guys

41
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:39,648
Sure it's nice to see them I mean it's a

42
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:43,232
Weird cuz I've I've worked with both of them to which

43
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:49,632
Would be a name drop if they weren't so utterly irrelevant to the culture at large you know it's still a bit of a Dream Drop

44
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:51,424
Ears out from everybody knowing

45
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,008
A little bit of a

46
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:58,080
Hard name-dropping a specific immunity

47
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:00,384
One that doesn't accept me anymore

48
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,480
It's good to see a possum

49
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:10,880
Today we ever episode go over and I got to be honest this was one of the most Rocky epi

50
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:13,952
Episodes I've heard in a long time ago

51
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:19,327
Rocky rocky road

52
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,095
It's

53
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,679
RockYou is moose and squirrel

54
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:30,335
Boris and Natasha are fighting

55
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:32,383
Nugget Bullwinkle's here

56
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:34,687
This is a mess

57
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:39,807
I'm very excited about it

58
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:43,135
We are now in 2020 to figure out something to do with it

59
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:49,535
The year but this is one last time

60
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,863
Coming a mile away a 31st

61
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:55,935
Who's been coming at me in the rearview mirror

62
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:59,519
One Last Ride. December 31st

63

Next to Eva who is personally cremated Care thank you so much

70
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:43,039
I got to assume that means that they've been to Bohemian Grove

71
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:47,647
Club member in the audience

72
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:54,815
Senior citizen thank you so much you are now technocrat

00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:12,479
Heroin

So good

76
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:17,087
Is freakishly large

77
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:25,535
Thank you very much wanted to do during this I wanted to start 2022 off with something kinda special

78
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:29,375
Like I wanted to do a project Camelot episode or

79
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:35,775
Jim Bakker I realize that's the recent Wars we're going to kick it down the road at although I do have a bunch of it

80
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,823
Tired

81
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,967
I feel wanted space craziness or

82
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:50,367
Learning more about the courts of Heaven like unreal

83
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:52,159
Your loved ones

84
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,439
Dude I are the

85
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:57,023
Cloud of witnesses in the court of Heaven I love it I Murphy

86
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:03,423
Eventually we're just going to get into like what the actual Tears Of Heaven in the courts yet

87
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,983
The u.s. marshals of the Courts of Heaven

88
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:09,055
They serve you with subpoenas

89
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:14,943
Fishing in a dry well there wasn't really much

90
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,479
Defiant and so

91
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,759
I've decided

92
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,575
Last day of the year Alex's kind of

93
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:21,599
Usually

94
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:27,999
You know in some kind of mood or yeah he's reflecting on something and throwing something that

95
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,023
Will be reflected back

96
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:33,631
So I decided to do that and here is an out-of-context drop from Today Show

97
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,191
Appreciate your call

98
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:42,591
Oh boy alright okay okay the beginning or the end of the show Uno's

99
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:45,151
Here's one more out of compass

100
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,711
Altru

101
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,551
A real hard

102
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:53,087
Touches the soul

103
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,623
Not on coke wow

104
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,391
Wow

105
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,415
Irene

106
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:57,951
You know that's deep

107
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:00,255
That's just Steve giving someone art

108
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,791
Is guarding someone

109
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,327
That's what he said

110
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:07,167
We start here on the 31st and here's where Alex is at

111
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:11,519
That shed yesterday I I told you that I was unable to sleep

112
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:12,799
4

113
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:14,847
At about 2 hours sleep

114
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,407
Very emotional yesterday

115
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,967
Talk about quitting and not doing the show

116
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,527
So I didn't go cane

117
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,575
Seriously

118
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:27,135
But also wasn't being dramatic

119
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:29,439
Doesn't feel right

120
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:32,767
To just come on.

121
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,839
Like you're calling a football game or baseball game this is

122
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,631
Really emotional for me

123
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:44,799
Devastate

124
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:48,127
Absolutely devastating

125
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,967
I almost did it yesterday

126
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:54,783
Come to the decision I'm going to share it on here

127
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:02,207
1 or whether it's going to be

128
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,999
Next week but

129
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:12,447
A lot of stuff you need to know about I mean

130
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,983
Wait till you hear this

131
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,311
All right look

132
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:21,151
I don't know what these big things are and I don't give a fuk

133
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:21,919
Because

134
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:28,319
You know what you said but yesterday you were all emotional and you were going to quit so we're going to 30

135
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:31,391
Because I

136
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:37,791
It's almost another apology before the day before

137
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:40,863
I want to access this based on the standard of what do you think

138
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:44,959
I was just saying that he didn't actually sincerely mean he was going to quit

139
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:46,239
And he wasn't being

140
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:50,079
Simultaneously both of those cannot be true

141
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,383
So anyway here's where we start

142
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,407
On December 30th

143
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:56,991
Okay let me really just start

144
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,015
Broadcast

145
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,295
From this perspective

146
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,599
I went to bed

147
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,647
Last night

148
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,975
115 the morning and never went

149
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:07,743
Sleep

150
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:10,303
The day

151
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:14,399
I was just so upset about the population going on

152
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:19,519
We made it come true except

153
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:22,591
Or slower

154
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,383
They're not 10 years behind

155
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:31,295
Meditating focusing researching in my mind thinking

156
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:34,111
I just feel overwhelmed

157
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:37,183
I f****** love that turn of phrase I didn't know you could

158
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:41,023
Just call thinking researching in your mind

159
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:47,423
I was doing some research I was cogitating good by that I mean researching of my mind

160
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:51,263
Cogitating literally being like

161
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:57,663
Not for nothing like Alex might have had a bad sleep night but

162
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,687
3 hours

163
00:10:58,943 --> 00:10:59,711
I guess not good

164
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:01,759
It'll probably be dragging the next day will like

165
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:05,599
I'm somebody who's had insomnia for the better part of my life

166
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:08,415
Call that not sleeping can kill you

167
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,463
No

168
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,231
But

169
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:12,767
I don't know I don't

170
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:17,887
It doesn't seem like a good enough excuse for something that you need to apologize for any

171
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:24,287
Blame it on your show as a professional Broad

172
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,055
Castor

173
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:29,407
I know more about his sleep cycle than I do any topic that he's covering

174
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:35,807
You realize that I know so much about how well this man is sleeping on any given night I think you know more about like you

175
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,087
Bizarre like

176
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:40,671
Just the picadillos of his emotional states to

177
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:43,487
Yeah it's really think there's more

178
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:46,815
Granular detail about that.

179
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:47,839
Quite frankly

180
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:52,959
This is Edward Murrow cat I don't really know what the news is like

181
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:55,519
Sleep well that's all I remember from him

182
00:11:55,775 --> 00:12:01,919
Frankie clock really should have been something cuz you're going to bed

183
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:05,503
Goodnight to you good luck to me

184
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:08,831
When Alex was not sleeping

185
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,111
You did some

186
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,903
They're researching it is mine

187
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,231
Did some praying

188
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:18,559
And if you listen closely it sounds like God was bullying him

189
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:26,239
Meditating focusing researching in my mind thinking

190
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,663
By the Holy Spirit

191
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,223
On my knees and start praying on the floor

192
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:40,319
Do you need

193
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,855
To get on your knees and put

194
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:42,623
Put your head on the ground

195
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,439
Our

196
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:46,975
Find God

197
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,863
And it was literally God just saying

198
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,591
We're going to have to go out

199
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,199
You're going to have to get focused and be a real man

200
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:12,575
Fun doing this you joke around too much you screw around yeah

201
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,343
Yeah

202
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:19,231
Play half-measures

203
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:21,791
So yeah God apparently

204
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,607
Is telling him to get it together

205
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:30,751
Is two seconds away from turning him into the Son of Sam killer right like we're there

206
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:37,151
I think this is a real emotional images of when he's failed

207
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:43,551
Theoretically God saved him imagine this is a real communication with a deity like

208
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:44,575
Hey dude

209
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:50,975
Look at this look at what I did for you for you you're not doing you're not holding up your end of the bargain

210
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:55,071
Saving you in situations where totally you don't deserve

211
00:13:55,327 --> 00:14:01,471
To be safe and you have made a deal with me in order for me to give you blessings right you know like hell right

212
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:08,639
Nothing at all like the devil whatsoever are you and I am God

213
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:14,527
For sure yeah I think this is this is an unhealthy

214
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:16,319
But at least

215
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:17,599
What

216
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:18,879
God is presumably

217
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:25,279
We telling Alec news get your s*** together and write your job seriously

218
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:30,911
I know God but I would say maybe you should be a little more serious about the stuff you do

219
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:33,727
Ways God specifically saying that you shouldn't be mad at

220
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:34,495
The Crewcuts

221
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:35,263
Is it your fault

222
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:40,639
We've never met at the court that you need to understand

223
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:44,479
Starts rambling a bit about how

224
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:46,271
You know people who get hurt by the vaccine

225
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:49,087
You know

226
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:50,623
Themselves

227
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:53,183
They're not going you're going to get mad at people like Al

228
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:55,487
Because they were right all along

229
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:59,583
And that they'll have to try and rationalize somehow that they were actually right

230
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:02,143
This is kind of what Trump is doing I was going to say

231
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:05,471
Most of those people will fight

232
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:08,031
Analyze

233
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,663
Convince themselves

234
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:16,223
That what they did was right

235
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,679
He was cutting off the fentanyl coming in

236
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:39,263
Got us out of the WHL he did so many great things

237
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:43,871
And then he wants you to, yelling so it as operation warp speed

238
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:56,927
England a year here

239
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:02,815
We have hundreds of thousands dead we know of millions maimed

240
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,983
About all the people I know

241
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,359
Or died

242
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:27,903
Supposedly

243
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:28,927
Bosch

244
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:32,767
But the really as I said yesterday

245
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:37,887
Really mad

246
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:39,167
Who's medical doctor

247
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,471
Who still hasn't come out

248
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:47,615
This is strong strategy on Alex's bar

249
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:48,895
Trump does not give us

250
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:55,295
Nope but you might be able to believe Grandpa possible

251
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,319
King of expectations

252
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:59,903
Let's leave Trump alone f*** it there's nothing we're going to gain their

253
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:03,231
Now Rand Paul is a doctor let's scream at him

254
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:05,279
What you should do is call him and be like

255
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:11,935
Don't you remember whenever I supported you here and don't you remember whenever I supported you here and don't you remember when I supported you here if you're not holding

256
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:16,031
Look up your end of the bargain is generational

257
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,823
Going out back and back

258
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:23,967
When I when he was running for president and there was only one set of footprints

259
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:27,039
That's what I was carrying him

260
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:29,599
Picked up this isn't going to work

261
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:30,623
Either

262
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:31,647
Know this point

263
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,671
But it's a

264
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:35,231
It's a better move than trying to keep

265
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:38,303
Going with drop because Trump obviously doesn't give a s***

266
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,631
He wasn't The Apprentice

267
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,911
No no

268
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:45,983
He wasn't a lifetime famous person

269
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:50,591
Clear to me I think that Alex is only shot

270
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:52,383
At getting somebody

271
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,175
To take care of

272
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,199
I guess

273
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:58,015
Seriously or to communicate with him

274
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:02,111
Is to go on Rogan first and then get that kind of level of

275
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:05,695
Bulshit out there and since he's clearly not going on Rogan again

276
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:08,767
It's just been left behind by these people

277
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:11,327
Quantum anymore

278
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:17,727
I don't think many people do

279
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:21,823
Jimmy Dore

280
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:24,383
Rachel Maddow

281
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:30,783
What the f*** happened I don't know well I don't think I don't think there was ever that great.

282
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,063
He's a piece of s*** but

283
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:36,415
I don't think that Alex realizes that when people

284
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,695
Say stuff like this

285
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:44,095
They're not saying something positive about him they're attacking Rachel Maddow by comparing her

286
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:47,679
You're so shity you're worse than Alex

287
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:52,031
Probably doesn't feel great

288
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,567
No publicity is bad publicity

289
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:54,591
Construe

290
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:57,151
So anyway we had to get to the news

291
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,175
Oh wait we do

292
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:08,671
What

293
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:12,255
But I want to talk about philosophy

294
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:15,071
Tale of two people

295
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:21,727
Private person becomes my friends and people that I know where they just be a common person or very famous person

296
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:22,751
Absolutely not

297
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:29,407
Absolutely not you brag and put all their celebrity for the album non-stop absolute non-stop Bragg

298
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,943
Stop talking about

299
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:37,343
Let me back in the earlier times it was like Dave Mustaine

300
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:40,927
There's his wife's tennis coach that guys up there too

301
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:45,535
I don't think the tennis partner and Alex are friends

302
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:48,351
There's a reporter

303
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:55,007
So yeah we got people already know it's Tucker

304
00:19:55,263 --> 00:20:01,407
Joe Rogan

305
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,943
Charlie Sheen and Christopher Walken

306
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,735
That's for sure not anymore

307
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:05,759
To be fair

308
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:08,575
Christopher Walken was never all that interested without doing

309
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:09,343
He was just

310
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:12,159
Cooking with Richard Belzer

311
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:13,695
He was accidentally all the show

312
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,255
But I'm going to go ahead and

313
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:18,815
Give me an example of two people that I know

314
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,423
1998

315
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:28,543
Immigration with him Young

316
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:29,823
So much over the years

317
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:32,639
Falling I'll be that issues has been smoking

318
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:33,663
A year

319
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:36,479
15 times a year

320
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:37,503
But

321
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:40,319
Thanks for that background

322
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:42,367
Tale of two people

323
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:43,391
You got

324
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:52,351
Understand those three types you understand

325
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:54,143
Explain

326
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:56,191
Something is very important because

327
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:05,663
But broadcast I don't think I'm making it Crystal Clear like it is in my mind I want you to real

328
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:09,247
Wrap your brain around that I do most of you already have

329
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:18,976
We got a paradox gallon

330
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,000
Lookout

331
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:21,536
I

332
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:24,352
I hear Alex saying that like

333
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:27,168
I'm not being understood when I talk about these things

334
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:30,752
And so I will try to clarify it in a way that's

335
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:33,312
You know accepting of something being

336
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:38,944
Paradox of confusing no idea what he's trying to introduce

337
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:40,736
Are there are aspects

338
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:41,504
2

339
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:42,528
Tucker

340
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,808
And Rogan

341
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,600
That if you understand the difference

342
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:46,880
What is between them

343
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:47,904
It somehow Illuminating

344
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,696
But then he threw himself in there too

345
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:53,792
I loved that moment because

346
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:57,120
In that moment you just you can see it all you're just like

347
00:21:57,376 --> 00:22:03,520
There's no way he cannot be the most important part of the Story 2

348
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:04,288
Who are not me

349
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:05,824
What that can't happen

350
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:09,408
There's also me it's pretty obvious

351
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:11,968
This the tale of two people

352
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:15,040
He's about how similar or different they are to Alex

353
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:21,696
And also spoiler alert entity shows up later

354
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:25,280
Globalist

355
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:27,584
Now what I'm going to do is tell you how great

356
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,352
These people are

357
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:32,448
But what I'm also doing is tell you why it telling you why they're not perfect

358
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,728
And why I am

359
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:36,288
The places that makes them different for me or false

360
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:42,944
Similar to me are good well I will get to eventually is that Tucker has one string could we

361
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:49,088
One weakness and Alex just has both.

362
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:52,160
I knew it was going to be that

363
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:54,464
What does paradox

364
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:56,512
I don't know if it's a paradoxica

365
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:57,792
Paradoxical

366
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,632
Both

367
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,448
Paradox

368
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,288
Logan

369
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:10,592
Completely happy on cloud nine

370
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:11,616
He's hot

371
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:15,712
I've got a hundred million dollars

372
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,392
Go ahead drama

373
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:24,928
And

374
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:30,816
He is

375
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:34,656
Waking up to what's really happening in the world

376
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:39,008
But it's not really sunk into him

377
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:41,056
How dystopic it's going to get

378
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:43,872
Worse from here

379
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:46,176
He organizes

380
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:47,712
Obelisk

381
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:51,296
A whole nother level

382
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:55,392
Very happy person

383
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:59,232
Mad about the shots he knows our poisonous he's trying to figure out is by Design

384
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:05,120
Then there's Tucker Carlson

385
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:14,080
I love seeing the left constantly fetishize oh my God he's going to run for president all he's a little Pub

386
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:16,384
What

387
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,432
Are we doing that

388
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:21,248
Carlson wants

389
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,296
Nothing to do with the presidency

390
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,576
Grew up around it

391
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:27,136
His dad ran a major federal agency

392
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,464
Tucker Carlson

393
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:33,536
Wants to live in the woods in Maine

394
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:36,864
What what are we talkin about

395
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:43,008
I don't know what I still don't understand exactly what they like it if you just listening to this sequentially what is the paradox

396
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,032
What are we talkin about

397
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,056
Alright so

398
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:47,872
Know some stuff but he's not fully awake

399
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:54,272
Cuz he doesn't realize that he needs to radicalize his audience and create essentially a Bro Army

400
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:57,856
Royal Tucker Carlson does know all of

401
00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:00,160
Everything and wants to live in the shack

402
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,184
Inmate right

403
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,208
And that's a paradox

404
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:04,000
It's confusing

405
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:10,912
That's not what a paradox paradoxes are confusing feel like they're that confusing I think they're more of just a conundrum in

406
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:17,312
Unsolvable problem if we looked up conundrum of

407
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:23,200
100% realize that after I said it

408
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:25,248
Best is Alex can lay out what the

409
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:26,272
The Paradox is

410
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:27,808
Carlson

411
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:34,208
Carlson gypsy

412
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,512
What does scalping

413
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:40,864
He's all the way away

414
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:43,680
As much as he can on Fox News

415
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:07,232
Paradox

416
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:10,560
He's more awake than Joe Rogan

417
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:14,656
But he doesn't have the complete freedom

418
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,520
That's not a paradox

419
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:25,408
That's not the right word now those are things that are like self-contradictory but also kind of true

420
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:28,992
Play the classic example is like someone saying this sentence is false

421
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,784
If that's correct in the sentence

422
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,320
But it's also true

423
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,344
If it's incorrect

424
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:35,648
Be true and that means it's false

425
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,696
It's circular and creates paradox

426
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:43,584
There are other varieties Paradox of the garage thought experiment know what Alex's describing is not paradoxical

427
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,120
It's really more kind of

428
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:45,888
Bad luck

429
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,240
It's kind of ironic in the sense of the word that Alanis Morissette use

430
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:52,800
Squeeze the far is it not

431
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:53,824
Right

432
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:59,712
It's really less of paradox and more of an excuse for Alex to use for why these people who are supposedly is complete allies

433
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:01,760
Doing exactly what he's doing

434
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:02,784
We're saying the same stuff

435
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:07,392
Joe is entirely free and could say all that stuff but he's not awake enough

436
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:10,976
Keeping his job at Fox

437
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:14,304
That's fun but it also makes no sense in its total b*******

438
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:16,864
Joe is not entirely free as evidence

439
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,144
By him being forced

440
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:23,776
To take down as episodes of people like Stefan molyneux in order to get that hundred million dollar contract with Spotify

441
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:27,872
Tucker was fully awake and knew the world was exactly as Alex

442
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:31,200
Describe saving his job at Foxwood mean exactly 02

443
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:34,016
He was born Philthy Rich so he doesn't need the money

444
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,320
Any good migrated is audience somewhere else

445
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:38,880
Suffuse being censored in any meaningful way on Fox

446
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:39,648
None of this is

447
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:40,928
Connected to reality

448
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:41,696
It's not a parrot

449
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:45,024
Yeah I like his description of Tucker's

450
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:49,120
Evolution just because it also reminds me of like a worm

451
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:49,888
Crawling towards

452
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:50,912
Detention

453
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:54,752
20 years ago Tucker Carlson didn't get any attention unless he hated me

454
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:57,312
10 years ago you got some attention for liking makes

455
00:27:57,568 --> 00:28:00,128
And now that he's me gets all the attention

456
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:06,528
Call me think about it 20 years ago if Tucker was even like a relevant figure he would have been a bow tie

457
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:10,112
Who is towing a very like hawkish

458
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:16,512
Conservative line and Alex was saying 9/11 was an inside job

459
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:17,792
Cross-purpose exactly

460
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:23,936
I'm years ago the tea party was on the rise and people like Alex maybe had a little bit more

461
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:30,080
Maybe you're in touch with the kind of audiences I

462
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:36,480
Realizing I'm going to need to reach

463
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:40,832
And now everything is Thunderdome so

464
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:44,928
So Alex gets talking about to his own

465
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,232
Life

466
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:48,000
How is that parrot

467
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:51,584
Well this is actually a paradox

468
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,120
But it's contradictory for sure

469
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:54,912
I grew up

470
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:58,496
Around people that know the world really worked and never even thought of it as an issue

471
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:00,544
I grew up knowing all this

472
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:02,592
10-years old

473
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:07,968
I was already

474
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:08,992
There

475
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:12,832
I get a family as much as John Birch

476
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:19,232
Doesn't match up with the rest of his

477
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,536
Supposed timeline

478
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:22,304
Like where you at

479
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,584
Satanist

480
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:25,888
Yeah if you did

481
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:28,192
Completely comprehend how the world works

482
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,728
210 how is it that you

483
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:33,312
She turned into like a sickness lover

484
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:39,712
16 somewhere around there mean that you understood what you were doing this was not being tricked into say

485
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:41,504
Satanism this was you making

486
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,296
Getting some sort of deal with the Devil

487
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:44,576
One that could perhaps

488
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:45,344
I don't know

489
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:52,256
Echo throughout your entire life to the point where several

490
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:57,376
Might might come to a head

491
00:29:57,632 --> 00:30:00,704
Possibly

492
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,264
Do we get another Paradox okay not a paradise

493
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:09,152
Weird mistake with your other having fun everything's right were telling jokes

494
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:10,688
He's just so happy

495
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,304
We may not be able to turn this back

496
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:29,888
This is the great reset takeover depopulation event

497
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:32,960
Paradox

498
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:37,568
Publisher going to turn into a starving horde

499
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:42,176
And they're planning on the in-game to make us join them just so we survive

500
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,456
Again that is not a

501
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:44,224
No

502
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:51,136
I'm really struggling with how often we're use it towards paradoxes having 20 idea it's not going to stop either

503
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,976
Locksmith

504
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:57,280
Nicely done

505
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:58,304
Yeah

506
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,328
This is

507
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,680
Silly I do like really happy

508
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:04,704
Yes yeah

509
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,728
He gets to

510
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,824
Get really high and drunk with weirdos for a living

511
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,640
What why wouldn't he be happy happy making

512
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:15,200
And then Tucker when you get to steak with Alex

513
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,480
He realizes that he

514
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:19,040
You getting a steak with Alex that sucks

515
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:24,928
Scott you'd kind of miserable always have your head on a swivel maternal going to cause a problem now

516
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:25,696
Alex

517
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:26,976
Is it

518
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:29,280
State Warriors wrestling if

519
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:30,560
Maybe he's been wrong

520
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:31,584
This whole time

521
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,680
Yeah

522
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:37,728
Yeah Jones you picked the wrong team

523
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:40,288
You'll be begging for help soon you'll see

524
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:43,616
Population will destroy you for trying to help

525
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,784
All the top people

526
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:54,880
Put me in that position

527
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:00,768
And then I ask myself

528
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:03,584
Am I wrong

529
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,424
Front

530
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,216
Should we go ahead

531
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:12,288
Satan

532
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,080
And

533
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:16,128
Killed majority of the population

534
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,712
Do that plant has the population

535
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:21,504
Doesn't care about themselves or children

536
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:27,136
Okay

537
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:30,720
All these other people decided to join it

538
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:33,024
I'm not going to join it is

539
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:35,328
They're so miserable there so

540
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:37,376
Empties are not their own men and women

541
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:39,424
And spiritually

542
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:45,568
Worse than a thousand deaths

543
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,664
God chose a bad representative here this is this is not

544
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:56,064
Good dude miserable too so it's like there's no real Big Dipper

545
00:32:56,576 --> 00:33:00,672
I hear this

546
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:06,560
Clip and I really just think that it's Alex trying to make him sound like he's an awesome person to the audience

547
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:10,656
Screening is fictional author of a life of luxury that he's turned down no.

548
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:11,680
Protective people

549
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:12,448
Yes of course

550
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:18,848
Complete nonsense also really important to Alex and speaks up with Satan to kill

551
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:23,456
Lost most of the population is because the people who are on the team of Satan they seem unhappy

552
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:27,040
It's inherently wrong to commit genocide

553
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:33,184
It's the devil has low workplace morale

554
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:36,768
Because personally that would be uncomfortable

555
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:43,424
It's not even that it's those people look bummed out even though he cares about them

556
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,240
It's because he would personally not want to feel as though

557
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:49,568
The way that he appear to have well that's true but

558
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:50,592
At the same time

559
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:53,152
I don't really feel like if you look at Alex

560
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:54,176
Did he look

561
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:54,944
Looks like he's enjoying

562
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:57,760
She had all that much honey kind of Express

563
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:03,136
Everybody in announces estimation should probably act more like

564
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:08,000
Joe and get 100 million dollars and just get high all the time why doesn't everybody just do that

565
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:12,608
Seems like an easy out Alex doesn't seem to be enjoying s*** all that much anymore

566
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,912
Larger

567
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:20,032
Just altaf what I'm trying articulator one trying to get at

568
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,360
But it really is this

569
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:25,152
I need to be able to enjoy my life

570
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:31,296
Function

571
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:35,136
Global assistance

572
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:44,864
You better wake up

573
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:49,984
Going to slowly tortured to death

574
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:58,176
Alright I think you should enjoy your life a little more

575
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:03,296
Someone is not enjoying their life too much lashing out angrily

576
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:06,112
Yeah I think he's looking at the problem from the wrong direction

577
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:08,416
You better enjoy your life more first

578
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:09,440
And then talk.

579
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:16,352
Werlor earlier we heard Alex at a teasing around this idea that maybe we should

580
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:17,632
Stick at the Rand Paul

581
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:19,424
Right because Trump doesn't give

582
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,960
Give a s***

583
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:21,728
Text Elise

584
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:25,824
And he continues on this line like maybe maybe it's time to

585
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,128
Really f****** go at Grandpa

586
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:32,224
Republicans take over the House and Senate

587
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:46,304
You pushed

588
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:50,400
Telling people that dangerous

589
00:35:58,336 --> 00:35:59,872
What the Hitler mustache on Rand Paul

590
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:07,296
Studies all day

591
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:12,928
Pressure

592
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:13,952
Call Sheldon

593
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:18,048
It's also a dumb dumb way to pressure people

594
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:20,096
Why putting a Hitler mustache on them

595
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:24,704
Turn of phrase is that something the people

596
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,776
How to put the Hitler mustache so I think he's literally saying let's gets

597
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:34,176
Some pictures of Rand Paul and then draw a little Hitler mustaches on their and I assume mail them to us heard Hitler mustache

598
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:35,456
Onramp all contacts

599
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:45,440
I just think there's probably more effective ways of pressuring

600
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:46,976
Leaders who you think

601
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:49,280
Maybe willing

602
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:50,560
To help

603
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:55,936
You sure I also think that maybe in terms of Rand Paul it'd be best if people in Kentucky

604
00:36:56,448 --> 00:37:02,592
Put that pressure would be a good idea cuz we don't think about representative

605
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:05,152
Crazy like this anymore but theoretically

606
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:13,600
No standing to put Hitler mustache

607
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:15,136
Scott Maybe

608
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:17,184
New

609
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,768
Rand Paul

610
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:24,608
So we need to get desperate that's the thing

611
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:27,936
That's Alex's desperate times call for desperate real

612
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:33,824
GE quote something bizarre okay just saw this

613
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:37,920
This quote like on a meme or something like that really excited

614
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:55,072
Responsibility

615
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:58,144
The children to expose these people

616
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:00,960
Go out to the clinic

617
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:03,776
Hold up

618
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:07,360
Wepa sister bringing a medical Tyrion 24 stats

619
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:10,688
Consenting children

620
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:16,576
Samurai is desperateness

621
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:19,392
10 man on war cannot kill such a man

622
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:31,424
If one uses discrimination he will fall behind

623
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:34,240
One needs M loyalty nor devotion

624
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:39,360
Loyalty and devotion art of themselves

625
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:40,896
Within desperation

626
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:44,480
I mean

627
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,856
Desperate man

628
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:53,440
I should be desperate

629
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:54,208
Pure Evil

630
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:56,512
At least I know what I'm fighting

631
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:03,680
Yeah he's quoting they hagakure a little surprise

632
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:08,032
That's either Forest Whitaker

633
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:14,432
You quoting the hagakure what is happening Alex is trying to live The Way of the Samurai

634
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:20,832
What is the samurai that was a hyper nationalistic book written to say that you don't romanticize the Japanese

635
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:26,464
Literally happened in order to get people to start wars that's what he's about is about

636
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:32,864
F****** with them you got to kill people on Fast shadow

637
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:34,912
Yeah

638
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:35,936
I found that to be a

639
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:39,008
Drain pool

640
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:44,896
I don't know if I've ever heard him quotes

641
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:48,992
But yeah I think he's just

642
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:55,648
I think it's really wouldn't like the parts about making sure that you are beautiful making sure that you always have me

643
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:58,208
Makeup there's a elderly available

644
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:00,512
In there you would probably should get you with

645
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:01,792
I think that

646
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:03,328
This is

647
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:07,936
Problematic in a certain way because he's at answering this idea of getting desperate

648
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:08,704
2

649
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,728
Protesting

650
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:11,008
At places like

651
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:13,312
I don't know vaccinations

652
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:16,384
And I don't believe that his audience would

653
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,944
Desperately educate people know

654
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:22,016
Ethos that drives a good harass

655
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:23,040
Harangue

656
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:24,064
But you just like

657
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:24,832
Pick

658
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:26,624
Pic not regular phone

659
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:29,952
Just leave regular folk out of this man you want to go after

660
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:30,720
Fauci

661
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:37,120
Find fauci

662
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:42,752
Video

663
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:46,336
The game is sustainable like when Alex is yelling about David Rock

664
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:49,408
Gfeller Hillary and Obama

665
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,944
It's a sustainable

666
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,504
Propaganda sphere but yeah

667
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,296
It's really impacting

668
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:56,320
Normal

669
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:58,624
People trying to live their lives

670
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:04,512
It becomes an issue don't make everybody a pain in your weird psychodrama

671
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:08,096
You know if you want to be screaming about almost

672
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:11,680
Goddamn fictional figures that you've created out of

673
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:15,008
Bulshit then fine but don't be like

674
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,800
Hey also

675
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:19,616
Doterra down the block needs to get her ass

676
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:27,808
Crew of people to like a community meeting or whatever it's like

677
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:34,464
Is this is bulshit

678
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:37,536
To look you I don't know if you know this

679
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:40,096
Deer in an earth suit right now

680
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:41,632
Okay

681
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:51,360
You have a spirit you have free will

682
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:52,128
You're just

683
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:01,343
God is going to separate you

684
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:02,111
From

685
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:03,135
Universe

686
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:04,415
You don't want to

687
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:11,839
Nothing's your very paradoxical

688
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:16,703
Today is not like what I do in the morning

689
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:23,871
It's paradoxical that you feel different in the morning and Aleve

690
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:27,967
I like the mixing of the grandiose language

691
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:34,367
Do you like sudo spirituality of like you're an eternal being in an earth suit

692
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:37,439
God will Smite you if you don't fight my enemies

693
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:39,743
A little it's a little bit much

694
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:41,279
Yeah let's just pull from

695
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:47,679
Tucking most death why not let's just throwing some fear not of been let you know what we're just pulling from everywhere we got the hog

696
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:49,471
Rakudai we got this b*******

697
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:50,239
Let's go for it

698
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:56,895
Alex is fighting these demons tales in with you being an eternal being in it

699
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:58,431
What have you

700
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:01,247
System

701
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:02,527
No laugh

702
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:04,575
When he talks about how he's fighting Dima

703
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:09,183
Little Green Manor Flying Saucer

704
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:17,119
I noticed the system doesn't laugh

705
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:19,167
Serious

706
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:25,055
And they've signed up for

707
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:27,359
And

708
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:33,247
Entering the New World Order is hurting children and hurting Humanity

709
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:34,783
Destroying

710
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:35,807
Our very future

711
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:38,623
How you get on board

712
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:40,415
With the Rockefeller program

713
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:42,207
That is not human

714
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:46,303
You think that's

715
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:47,327
Human

716
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:51,167
No right

717
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:52,959
10%

718
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:53,983
Everybody knows

719
00:43:54,495 --> 00:44:00,639
Hundred percent as a walk-in that's easy easy that's the one that you're like oh so that's what a walk-in looks

720
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:07,039
Like a Rockefeller

721
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:13,439
Monica beetle

722
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:14,975
Little demons

723
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:15,999
We're regularly

724
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:21,375
I do think that the subject probably makes less headlines about him probably just because like

725
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:23,167
The media

726
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:24,959
Yeah

727
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:28,031
Videos fighting demons doesn't rank

728
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:31,359
Compared to the real world f*****-up things that Alex is involved in

729
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:35,711
News stories surrounding January 6th

730
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:38,783
All sorts of things are maybe more present

731
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:43,135
Whether or not he thinks he's fighting demons they are more pressing but I feel like

732
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:47,487
The biggest problem with those things is that were not always given the context

733
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:53,887
Two of the he's fighting demons far along with it would be nice if it was at least a little bit of a reminder

734
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:58,751
Demon fighter Alex Jones yeah I think I think it would give a little bit of

735
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:04,895
Flavor seasoning for those stories man who has not successfully slayed 1

736
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:09,503
Demon is his entire life Alex Jones you don't know that

737
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:15,903
I feel like he would have crowed non-stop about it if you refuse to listen to

738
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:18,975
Be true

739
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:22,047
So there's a there's a bit of demons out there

740
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:24,863
Obviously we know all that much about

741
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:26,655
No I think

742
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:28,447
Well obviously I know one thing that's

743
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:29,727
That I don't believe they exist

744
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:31,007
Sure that's a problem

745
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:34,079
I don't really know what they're like

746
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:35,615
Thankfully Alex comes in

747
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:36,895
With some details

748
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:42,783
There but they are

749
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:50,719
Not sure

750
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:56,863
Manipulate

751
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:59,679
Humans will work with them

752
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:05,567
We don't go around trying to do all the stuff

753
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:06,335
What

754
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:07,615
But they do

755
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:09,919
Seems to me that Alex's

756
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:10,687
It is saying

757
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:13,503
That they're Dumber but maybe older bride Ono

758
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:16,575
Yeah yeah there's a team

759
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:18,111
A specialist team but their craft

760
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:19,391
Label of tricks

761
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:20,671
And yeah

762
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:22,719
Without them

763
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:28,607
Without these demons right humans never lie and cheat at all really that's a real bummer

764
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:29,887
We should get rid of them

765
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:32,191
I think they're really f****** things up if that's

766
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:38,079
If Alex legitimately believe that and that wasn't just something that he randomly said or misspoke sure

767
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:39,103
That is a

768
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:40,639
Painfully naive

769
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:43,967
Way to look at the wall it's just a bummer

770
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:46,271
It's just a bummer not least of which because

771
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:47,039
Is God

772
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:48,575
What a shity life

773
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:51,135
What is city life every human being was

774
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,671
Consigned to upon birth

775
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:55,999
To just be like occasionally grabbed in the influence by

776
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:56,767
Demon

777
00:46:57,023 --> 00:47:03,167
You didn't get the choose but at the same time every time you did anything bad it wasn't you

778
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:09,567
Motherfuker is a real a******

779
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:12,639
I think of narcissists usually take responsibility for things right

780
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:19,039
Last night Alex didn't sleep well but he also a thing cuz probably like before he went to bed

781
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:20,063
Commutative

782
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:22,111
They found one

783
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:31,071
Did you get her off and in my hate

784
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:32,351
Made me

785
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:36,959
Elaine Maxwell

786
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:41,311
Alex

787
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:44,127
Alex

788
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:46,175
Fresh Alex

789
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:47,967
Got up it

790
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:50,015
1:50 in the morning cuz I couldn't sleep

791
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:53,599
Oh my gosh

792
00:47:57,695 --> 00:48:01,023
Federal judge with the defense team and the prosecutor

793
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:04,607
Suppress the black book

794
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:08,703
I'll pedophiles and they say they'll now be protected

795
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:13,823
Now is rewarding the judge

796
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:15,871
Teleport job with

797
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:20,223
Such a bizarre way to discuss this

798
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:20,991
The situation

799
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:25,087
Alex says the night before you needed a victory and wanted to feel good

800
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:31,743
They made a video talk about how the Maxwell verdict was a win but later he actually looked into it I realized it was bad news

801
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:32,511
News

802
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:38,143
This is pretty revealing inasmuch as it kind of shows that Alex is completely willing to put out reactions

803
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:40,191
The news items without looking into them at all

804
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:43,519
Specifically for the purpose of satisfying his emotional needs

805
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:44,543
That's pretty bad

806
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:46,079
Yeah yeah

807
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:52,479
That sucks no that's real if you have a responsibility to do and I would argue that you have a responsibility

808
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:54,015
Audience

809
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:59,135
That's not keeping up your head to the park and they should probably call you and say

810
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:05,535
Do you remember when we helped you hear do you remember when we helped almost like using the audience to satisfy those

811
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:06,559
Emotional needs

812
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:10,655
Information

813
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:17,055
Just because it feels good

814
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:18,591
A little bit different than what our two saying

815
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:24,479
He posted that video that was about the Maxwell vertic being a win because that was his immediate reaction to the news

816
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:29,855
By the next day he's online conspiracy World surrounding

817
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:31,391
And they believe that this was a cover

818
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:34,719
In order to make sure his messaging was in sync with the larger

819
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:36,511
Conspiracy World Alex changed

820
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:42,655
The talking points Alex is using hair crip directly from social media post spreading misinformation about the case

821
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:46,495
There wasn't sweeping ceiling of documents in fact the judge ordered it

822
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:47,775
Thought of it Beyond sealed

823
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:50,335
Including transcripts of depositions and bank records

824
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:53,663
What Alex is misrepresenting here is that the judge found the quote

825
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:56,223
Only certain pages for Maxwell's address book

826
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:59,039
Identifying victims with the word massage next to them

827
00:49:59,295 --> 00:49:59,807
Could be mark

828
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:00,575
Into evidence

829
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:02,879
This was to protect the identity of the victim

830
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:04,415
Not to Shield any of the abuser

831
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:09,279
Also Schumer isn't making that judge Alison Nathan and appellate Judge Adams

832
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:10,559
Some kind of quid pro quo

833
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:14,399
The vacancy came up in the US court of appeals in the second district

834
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:17,983
And Schumer recommended this judge dividing the sun would make a good nominee

835
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:21,567
This makes sense given that Schumer is a senator from New York

836
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:24,127
Nathan serves on the United States disc

837
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:26,943
District court for the southern district of New York

838
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:29,759
And the US court of appeals for the second district

839
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:31,039
Covers New York Vermont

840
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:33,343
In Connecticut New York Mets

841
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:36,671
I want to find a Chase the conspiracy World instead of leading it

842
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:41,023
He came out to celebrating the Maxwell verdict because he assumed that was the right

843
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:42,559
Let me saw that everyone like Jack

844
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:44,607
Sobek was going the other way with it

845
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:45,631
They changed his opinion

846
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:49,983
You haven't looked in the case prior to deciding that it was a victory and he didn't look in

847
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:52,799
Intuit it all in order to change his mind

848
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:56,383
This is just a dude blowing in the wind it's nice

849
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:59,455
If you was real busy when he woke up at 1

850
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:01,503
Who's playing at Billy by God

851
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:04,063
To look at it to the Elaine Maxwell birthday

852
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:10,463
Amazing you know he's well over $14 for 20 hours a day just to

853
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:16,863
To make sure that he gives us high quality content what high-quality content to gives up its

854
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:19,935
It's so bad it's amazing and that's kind of a pair.

855
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:24,287
I'm looking for biting analysis of Maxwell verdict

856
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:25,823
Right cuz Alex's show

857
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:30,175
Can you come out and said it's a victory but then done so much research that you haven't figured out

858
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:30,943
Stuber

859
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:33,759
So obviously if he's done all that he's got a lot of information

860
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:39,135
There's got to be a ton of stuff that was covered up he wouldn't like I don't know spend a bunch of time

861
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:39,903
Doing a

862
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:42,463
Terrible attempt at a comedy bit

863
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:43,999
About how he

864
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:45,791
It's better the judge looks like a man

865
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:47,327
You wouldn't do that

866
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:53,215
Oh no oh does he ever oh no no

867
00:51:57,055 --> 00:52:00,383
We don't need to make a big circus out of this

868
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:04,479
Anybody in the black book

869
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,271
In a bed

870
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:12,159
Has Judge

871
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:13,439
Mister Nathan

872
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:15,999
He's doing I'm sorry

873
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:19,327
Alison Nathan

874
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:21,887
Chucky Schumer

875
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:25,983
How many you got

876
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:30,079
Still going

877
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:32,127
Alison Nathan

878
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:44,415
Aftershows you defending Nation covering it happen

879
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:47,999
Yikes

880
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:49,279
That was not good

881
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:55,935
But it was clearly intended as like he was trying to be funny I guess like he thinks that he was trying to be funny

882
00:52:56,191 --> 00:53:01,311
I think the idea of like stammering through something is enough for him

883
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:07,711
He's he's basically like on the level of of Bob Newhart with his stammer comedy

884
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:09,759
Who's good

885
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:12,831
USO tour

886
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:19,487
Reference The Young Turks there that unfortunately triggered something in his brain where he remembered

887
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:22,047
Bat in 2013

888
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:28,447
I did it

889
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:34,847
He would he would legalize bestiality where you're given pleasure to the animal

890
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:46,879
Do a loose conversation

891
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:49,183
Conversation

892
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:49,951
I don't think

893
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:50,719
Vapes

894
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:55,839
Necessarily he wanted saying he wanted to be a dictator or was he

895
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:59,167
Fully supporting having sex with animals

896
00:53:59,423 --> 00:53:59,935
To give you back

897
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:02,751
Yeah yeah anyway Alex remembers this

898
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:09,151
And he has to spend a lot of time to Outback

899
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:11,711
Teddiursa go

900
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:13,247
By the way

901
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:15,295
The young turds leader

902
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:16,831
Nice

903
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:21,439
Fantasize about having sex with animals and pleasuring them

904
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:25,791
World

905
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:35,007
First thing that pops in your head and it not the hundred

906
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:42,175
First thing when you're dictator in the world is

907
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:53,439
Benevolent

908
00:54:58,047 --> 00:54:59,839
Where your pleasuring the animal

909
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:06,239
I want to point out that this is supposed to be his coverage of the Maxwell trial that we were going to be speaking of

910
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:12,639
About anything other than philosophy or bestiality but apparently I'm wrong

911
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:14,943
Nothing on this Maxwell

912
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:16,991
But he's got to go this route

913
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:21,087
I want to have fun like you do too

914
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:29,023
No

915
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:30,047
No it's not

916
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:34,655
Complete

917
00:55:57,183 --> 00:55:58,207
That he has sex with a man

918
00:55:58,975 --> 00:56:01,023
He just talks about how much

919
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:05,119
If I was casting somebody

920
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:06,655
What

921
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:09,215
If I was going to

922
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:11,519
Cast somebody in a movie

923
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:14,847
Runza pet stores you can have sex with animals

924
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:16,639
Aquarium fish

925
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:18,431
Give me that

926
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:20,479
Come on if you had The Gaslight

927
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:24,063
Is that a farmer

928
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:26,111
Is that an auto mechanic

929
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:27,647
Is that a soldier

930
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:29,695
Is that a teacher

931
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:32,511
Is that a lawyer we had was pretty stunning

932
00:56:33,279 --> 00:56:35,839
Is he a pedophile Nano no

933
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:44,287
Somebody

934
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:46,591
Did I sexually animals of course against

935
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:57,343
Something interface Theory

936
00:56:57,855 --> 00:56:58,879
Something

937
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:03,231
Chiladas cold beer and Marilyn Monroe

938
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:04,767
Everyday of the week

939
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:07,327
What

940
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:09,887
He's over here

941
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:12,191
Farm animals

942
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:14,495
What the f*** is going on

943
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:19,615
Come on man that God was telling you.

944
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:21,151
Cheez-It

945
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:22,687
Yeah this is like

946
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:29,087
It's so transparent I don't want to talk about this subject that I haven't prepared for its much more

947
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:31,135
Fun for me to read about Janke

948
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:34,207
This is where we're going to go with his look at his mouth

949
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:35,231
Boy

950
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:42,399
This reminds me a little bit of I told you one of the things that I enjoy

951
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:46,239
Enjoy the Joyride

952
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:51,871
And what are the things that I love so much about Dana Gould is after having a 40 goddamn year career

953
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:53,151
In stand-up

954
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:59,295
His level of confidence in being funny on stage he can tell a five-minute story with no labs

955
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:03,135
So confident that he's going to get a laugh at the end you know

956
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:04,671
40 years of experience

957
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:06,463
I'm amazed metallic

958
00:58:06,975 --> 00:58:08,255
Maintaining and

959
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:11,071
Obtaining that same level of confidence

960
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:17,471
Never having received a laugh

961
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:18,239
Does laughing

962
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:24,895
You can't tell ya ya recording send feedback

963
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:26,431
Jim Breuer

964
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:32,831
Sure Alex loves that Jim Breuer

965
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:34,111
Meat of the subject

966
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:36,927
Jones

967
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:41,279
Change this

968
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:46,143
Play Maxwell's little black book remain Secret

969
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:48,959
Needless

970
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:50,495
Name-dropping

971
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:53,567
We don't want to needlessly

972
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:54,335
Name-drop

973
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:55,871
Girls

974
00:58:57,151 --> 00:58:57,919
The judge

975
00:58:58,175 --> 00:58:59,455
Good person

976
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:01,503
I want to remember to do his homework

977
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:07,903
Blind kind of narratives with a body of the article explains the situation in a way that makes everything fall flat

978
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:12,255
But one thing the black book in question is the same one that Gawker published back

979
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:13,023
In 2015

980
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:16,095
Second being listed in this address book.

981
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:19,935
Not prove that you were involved with Maxwell and Epstein child abuse stuff

982
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:25,311
Conclusion for Alex to come to give them any other staunch belief and due process

983
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:29,919
Baby really hates people describing guilt-by-association when it involves him

984
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:33,759
Third as we've already mentioned the book contains identifying information about Victor

985
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:36,063
Doesn't making that public would really only hurts

986
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:41,439
The story at all in the independent article was published on December 4th

987
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:43,231
New article

988
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:46,559
Does nothing to do with the decision involved in Maxwell.

989
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:47,327
Conviction

990
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:49,375
It was just a matter of course for the trial

991
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:53,983
Alex is also ignoring another more recent independent article with the headline quote

992
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:58,079
Ghislaine Maxwell's little black book under FBI review says report

993
00:59:58,591 --> 01:00:02,687
Authorities found to pursue anyone who committed a crime with Epstein & Maxwell

994
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:09,087
I was just reporting on these gun stories he's just reading dumb headlines from dumb blogs and social media post

995
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:11,903
Getting mad about them without doing any leg work at all

996
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:14,719
That's why he'd rather spend his time talking about Jake like

997
01:00:16,511 --> 01:00:19,071
Cooler Fred what else is there to say with

998
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:21,119
The judgement other than like

999
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:22,655
Okay who's next

1000
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:23,679
You know

1001
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:28,031
Like that's what that's what I feel like everybody saying about the Maxwell judgment like yeah

1002
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:29,823
She's getting

1003
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:31,103
That now who

1004
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:34,687
Feels like there is forward momentum with

1005
01:00:34,943 --> 01:00:35,455
Uppercase

1006
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:36,735
There's a conviction

1007
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:40,319
Everybody wants let's see what happens

1008
01:00:40,831 --> 01:00:45,951
Unless you want to just get pitchforks

1009
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:47,999
You might

1010
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:50,047
That's a conversation

1011
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:52,863
Well you might mess up

1012
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:53,631
Versation

1013
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:54,655
Globalist

1014
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:59,263
They want to suck children's energy out because children have this

1015
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:00,799
Innocence and bacon

1016
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:04,639
They can have that vacuum.

1017
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:09,759
Has a really good one for that something

1018
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:12,319
Maybe makes it more understand

1019
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:14,623
Because everything is about

1020
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:15,647
Assess

1021
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:17,439
The Innocents energy

1022
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:24,095
Crystal

1023
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:29,215
Play

1024
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:34,591
Batman

1025
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:38,943
Ponzi's systems in tuna suck their Essence in their life force

1026
01:01:46,111 --> 01:01:46,879
Because

1027
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:51,231
That's really who they are

1028
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:53,023
Pfizer so evil

1029
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:56,351
Wawa

1030
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:04,031
Gets them closely aligned

1031
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:05,055
Where's

1032
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:08,639
The transmission.

1033
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:10,175
They are wanting

1034
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:11,455
To receive

1035
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:15,807
You need to study the dark crystals you don't understand is a real world

1036
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:18,111
Theoretically

1037
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:22,463
Your God invented this whole system he had to if he's the Creator

1038
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:28,863
Why did he develop a separate Economy based upon innocence energy

1039
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:29,887
Like in Monsters Inc

1040
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:32,447
Yeah it is it does seem

1041
01:02:33,471 --> 01:02:39,615
Not good because it cut it out create this separate

1042
01:02:39,871 --> 01:02:46,015
No they did not seem like a good idea at the time

1043
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:51,903
Gives you power and money of the economy or whatever

1044
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:53,439
Migos

1045
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:55,743
Yeah it's going to go south

1046
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:58,303
That is because

1047
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:07,007
So you know the gallbladder

1048
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:09,055
They want to take that innocence

1049
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:11,871
Crystal

1050
01:03:12,127 --> 01:03:14,431
But there's something you can do and Alex as a recommendation

1051
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:17,759
Everything they do is about corrupting the youth

1052
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:19,295
Everything they do

1053
01:03:19,551 --> 01:03:21,087
Is about enslaving the innocent

1054
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:23,903
Spiritually reject them

1055
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:28,255
This is too big

1056
01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:31,327
To take me over

1057
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:37,471
As a metaphysical symbol of that

1058
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:40,799
Raise your hands your fingers open like a planet to the Sun

1059
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:45,663
Help me I want to be good

1060
01:03:45,919 --> 01:03:48,223
Please.

1061
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:49,503
Please help me

I don't know the words to say just help me help me Jesus help me

1063
01:03:57,439 --> 01:03:59,999
Okay Rose Muller under satanic control

1064
01:04:01,023 --> 01:04:02,815
Physically do that it's a big victory

1065
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:04,351
You're going to feel a block there

1066
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:06,399
A block

1067
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:11,007
You cry out

1068
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:14,079
Lazarbeam

1069
01:04:14,591 --> 01:04:16,127
He's going to burn through that hole

1070
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:20,735
You're the one that all hell break loose your family all hell break loose your life

1071
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:34,815
Admissions for you

1072
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:36,095
Little ones at 4

1073
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:38,143
What

1074
01:04:38,399 --> 01:04:41,215
This is a call

1075
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:44,799
Where's the describing occult I do like the notion

1076
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:46,079
Things that people are like

1077
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:50,431
Hey Alex Jones is right about everything you got to listen to Alex Jones man

1078
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:58,367
Do they listen to this ship did you and now it's stupid if Alex is right about everything then I

1079
01:04:58,623 --> 01:05:04,767
Believe that means every single person who has ever said that is required right now you can throw their hands

1080
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:06,815
To the sky scream

1081
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:12,447
God help me help me please I don't want to be involved with Satan anymore for as long as it

1082
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:13,727
F****** takes

1083
01:05:13,983 --> 01:05:18,335
Forgot Blazer to bust through the energy Shield of the devil

1084
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:20,383
And give you a mission like

1085
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:26,783
PG then they need to abandon their families get rid of them entirely and slow hell's going to break

1086
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:33,183
Recluse definition

1087
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:37,023
Character you know you got to think about it life is kind of a collectathon

1088
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:38,559
Little bit

1089
01:05:38,815 --> 01:05:41,119
To look when you die

1090
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:42,143
If you did good

1091
01:05:42,399 --> 01:05:42,911
Yeah

1092
01:05:43,423 --> 01:05:43,935
Good stuff

1093
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:48,543
Are you sure I really think he doesn't understand the whole book

1094
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:49,823
Okay if that's what he thinks

1095
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:52,639
There is something that is very clearly biblical

1096
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:54,431
Okay

1097
01:05:54,687 --> 01:05:56,991
Stands like a barcode

1098
01:05:57,247 --> 01:05:57,759
When you die

1099
01:05:58,527 --> 01:06:03,135
River at the end when we die

1100
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:07,743
Ice Candy

1101
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:13,119
Simplehuman

1102
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:16,191
It's what we did

1103
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:17,727
Narwhal interaction

1104
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:19,775
He's red.

1105
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:22,847
Change alert and on you

1106
01:06:26,687 --> 01:06:28,223
Literal black hole opens.

1107
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:33,343
You don't want to go there

1108
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:34,367
Believe me

1109
01:06:35,903 --> 01:06:39,231
Tomorrow's news today

1110
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:41,023
This is tomorrow's news

1111
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:41,791
Yeah

1112
01:06:42,047 --> 01:06:42,815
Yeah yeah

1113
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:44,863
You know I mean

1114
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:49,983
At the heart of it though aren't it isn't the isn't the heart of most dogmode just some

1115
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:51,263
Some Nut Job

1116
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:52,031
Riffing

1117
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:52,799
You know

1118
01:06:53,311 --> 01:06:59,455
I got that at the beginning but like an argument somebody's out there like where this f****** thunder come from and then

1119
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:01,759
Like man you don't even want to know about this guy Zeus

1120
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:03,039
This guy is tall

1121
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:07,135
I mean explanations for phenomenon in nature off in like

1122
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:09,951
You know it's a pretty creative process

1123
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:11,743
Yeah

1124
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:14,303
I do think that the Alex has a lot of bizarre specific

1125
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:20,703
Fixing there like angel looks at you and then you drop down you have a little flurries

1126
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:21,471
Excited for the

1127
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:25,055
For the cheap seats visualize

1128
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:27,615
Alex comes back from break

1129
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:30,943
Antigua wants to talk about a fellow that he used to know

1130
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:31,711
Who's that now

1131
01:07:32,735 --> 01:07:33,759
Talking about right now

1132
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:35,551
RideNow

1133
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:37,599
You know I knew Aaron Russo really good

1134
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:47,839
Murphy and was in

1135
01:07:48,095 --> 01:07:50,655
Very smart guy in a big silver traitor and I

1136
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:56,799
Trade a lot of silver with that dude

1137
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:06,015
You talked about how he was hanging out with the Rockefellers and they said

1138
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:09,855
Oregon collapse Society

1139
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:12,927
If you don't do what you want politically will just turn that chip off

1140
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:15,487
Galerias Coleman's 40 died in Houston

1141
01:08:19,327 --> 01:08:20,095
He was also

1142
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:26,239
Sure

1143
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:36,223
Who discuss this a bit in the past but the person who Aaron Russo is friends with with a guy named Nicholas Rockefeller and he wasn't related to

1144
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:37,247
The Rockefeller family

1145
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:41,599
You just have the same name and the level of investigation that these people do is

1146
01:08:41,855 --> 01:08:42,367
Pathetic

1147
01:08:42,879 --> 01:08:46,207
Also Bette Midler was never married Russo

1148
01:08:46,463 --> 01:08:49,791
She's a married to Martin Von haselberg since 1984

1149
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:53,119
Russo was however her manager for a while

1150
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:56,959
Some sources was a complete creep who tried to take control of her life entirely

1151
01:08:57,215 --> 01:08:59,775
Animals in love with her though the feelings were unrequited

1152
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:06,431
I guess either told Alex they were married and Alex believed it or Alex is just making that up based on the fact there are bunch of pictures of the two of them

1153
01:09:06,687 --> 01:09:07,199
Come together

1154
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:09,503
How do I say this is just an introduction for Alex

1155
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:11,295
Complain about Bette Midler's tweet

1156
01:09:11,551 --> 01:09:13,855
About Joe manchin there was actually kind of shity

1157
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:15,903
Cuz it was taking aim at like

1158
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:17,183
There was

1159
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:23,583
There was some classism of it like West Virginia you f***

1160
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:26,143
A critique you could make probably

1161
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:32,287
That's not what I looks does so because he's about to get into that made alert

1162
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:38,687
I guess that's a lot of Preamble here to give us a personal in

1163
01:09:38,943 --> 01:09:41,759
Bitching about that meddler

1164
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:43,551
I think this is where the show Turn

1165
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:47,903
Every time you bring up Bette Midler dance

1166
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:49,695
Everythingoes a******

1167
01:09:49,951 --> 01:09:54,303
Yeah that's true since 1984 when she left Aaron Russo

1168
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:56,095
They went together

1169
01:09:56,607 --> 01:09:58,399
Yeah busy busy

1170
01:09:58,655 --> 01:10:00,191
He gets really impassioned

1171
01:10:00,703 --> 01:10:05,567
About Bette Midler's comments

1172
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:09,151
You're not going to live forever

1173
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:11,455
You're not going to cross that River

1174
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:15,807
God right now

1175
01:10:17,855 --> 01:10:19,647
What's going on

1176
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:22,463
Your hatred of America

1177
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:24,511
Because we were once a Christian Nation

1178
01:10:28,351 --> 01:10:30,399
A Christian Nation that Eragon

1179
01:10:30,911 --> 01:10:31,423
Monster

1180
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:35,007
You can't really signal more clearly to anti-semites than that

1181
01:10:35,263 --> 01:10:40,895
Butler someone who's very associated with her Jewish Heritage and for Alex to say that the reason she hates America

1182
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:41,663
Is it cuz it was a

1183
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:43,455
A Christian Nation is pretty over

1184
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:46,271
Even for him

1185
01:10:49,855 --> 01:10:53,695
Kind of informs a little bit like why he's Zoey gets

1186
01:10:53,951 --> 01:10:55,487
Ely impassioned

1187
01:10:55,743 --> 01:10:57,023
About this Bette Midler

1188
01:10:57,279 --> 01:11:00,095
Situation most days I wake up

1189
01:11:00,351 --> 01:11:00,863
And I think

1190
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:06,751
There's just no way I'm going to talk about somebody was mad at Bette Midler today

1191
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:08,543
And most days I'm right

1192
01:11:08,799 --> 01:11:11,871
The Divine today I was not right

1193
01:11:12,639 --> 01:11:17,503
If pretty mad here's a use them yelling looks down on West Virginia coal miners

1194
01:11:18,015 --> 01:11:19,551
Just like West Virginia right

1195
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:26,463
They're all a bunch of methods there a bunch of trash we don't need them no more we turned off the Cold Supply we don't need

1196
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:32,863
5000 feet down in the ground in mine anymore get their lungs all filled up we don't need those men

1197
01:11:33,887 --> 01:11:39,775
Cops in Hollywood

1198
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:45,151
Persian Missouri

1199
01:11:46,175 --> 01:11:51,295
Those farmers in South Dakota are those farmers in California

1200
01:12:01,535 --> 01:12:05,119
Everything's good

1201
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:10,495
Dodge

1202
01:12:15,615 --> 01:12:16,639
That's f***** up

1203
01:12:16,895 --> 01:12:19,455
But don't change

1204
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:20,735
I mean you know

1205
01:12:21,247 --> 01:12:22,783
I will give this to her

1206
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:26,879
Bette Midler is never brought me to tears so this is her best

1207
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:28,159
Best acting role to date

1208
01:12:28,415 --> 01:12:29,183
Ferrets

1209
01:12:29,695 --> 01:12:30,975
Upsetting

1210
01:12:32,255 --> 01:12:32,767
Why

1211
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:35,839
Are we here what happened

1212
01:12:36,095 --> 01:12:41,471
A really good argument to move away from coal mining and that bizarre rant

1213
01:12:41,727 --> 01:12:47,871
There's other more efficient means to produce energy in the process of mining coal kills workers lungs and such

1214
01:12:48,127 --> 01:12:48,639
Best way to go

1215
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:50,943
Maybe if you're looking out for these workers

1216
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:57,343
Not want them to be no I romanticize a time whenever we would sacrifice the

1217
01:12:57,599 --> 01:12:59,135
The lives of men and women too

1218
01:12:59,391 --> 01:13:02,463
Literally power our engines

1219
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:06,047
That's good good keep that up it's great

1220
01:13:06,303 --> 01:13:08,095
Alex got really f***** up there

1221
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:09,375
Don't know what happened

1222
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:10,911
It was it was quick

1223
01:13:11,423 --> 01:13:15,775
It seemed to come almost out of nowhere is it turn was like okay go to break

1224
01:13:16,031 --> 01:13:19,871
Splash some water on your face something get back and like let's see

1225
01:13:20,127 --> 01:13:21,919
Let's see what we got okay

1226
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:23,199
Besides to

1227
01:13:23,455 --> 01:13:26,271
Stay on this topic Alex

1228
01:13:28,063 --> 01:13:32,671
Who are these farmers

1229
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:40,607
There's not rocks in the fields

1230
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:50,335
No no they're the bad people

1231
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:57,247
You're the one trying to raise their families and grow crops

1232
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:07,743
Chinese Hollywood trash

1233
01:14:10,047 --> 01:14:14,655
Sir this is a Best Western

1234
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:22,335
The New World Order

1235
01:14:34,111 --> 01:14:38,463
When I get that Alex doesn't like Hollywood folk and he feels like they look down on him but

1236
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:41,023
Also seems like you really cares a lot

1237
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:42,303
About them looking down on

1238
01:14:43,071 --> 01:14:45,631
Seems like if he was like really Transcendent like he claims

1239
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:46,655
To be nice all through the

1240
01:14:46,911 --> 01:14:47,423
Bulshit

1241
01:14:47,935 --> 01:14:48,959
You just ignore s*** like

1242
01:14:49,215 --> 01:14:51,775
Bette Midler tweets as opposed to doing what he's doing which is

1243
01:14:52,031 --> 01:14:54,079
Performative

1244
01:14:54,591 --> 01:14:56,895
It's not somebody who doesn't care what Hollywood thinks

1245
01:14:57,151 --> 01:15:00,991
Sabaton like really sensitive

1246
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:04,575
About how people perceive him

1247
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:10,207
A bidder who thinks that the shipping was our Lord didn't receive because

1248
01:15:10,463 --> 01:15:14,047
What are these crimes

1249
01:15:14,559 --> 01:15:20,703
This was a rant about someone insulting farmers and West Virginia coal miners

1250
01:15:20,959 --> 01:15:21,727
Probably

1251
01:15:21,983 --> 01:15:26,079
Mid-level larceny in the past

1252
01:15:27,103 --> 01:15:29,663
Tentatively positive statements about free speech

1253
01:15:31,711 --> 01:15:36,575
Keisha bought the estate to get involved with some of the state's self-starters

1254
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:42,207
Do you know is long as it's a state government that controlling Free Speech you know that's fine

1255
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:45,023
What does states rights issue

1256
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:47,327
So look at you know what the state

1257
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:49,631
Tropical federal government

1258
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:54,239
Should destroy Hollywood

1259
01:15:54,495 --> 01:15:56,287
Government should destroy Hollywood

1260
01:15:56,799 --> 01:15:59,103
California state government or Texas estate cover

1261
01:15:59,359 --> 01:16:03,967
Probably Texas

1262
01:16:04,223 --> 01:16:10,111
Texas and California to really go at it for once there's a couple states in the middle that might have something to say about that

1263
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:10,879
Anyway

1264
01:16:11,135 --> 01:16:13,695
Hollywood got to be destroyed

1265
01:16:17,023 --> 01:16:17,535
They're just

1266
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:21,631
Please

1267
01:16:24,703 --> 01:16:26,751
Culturally non-violently

1268
01:16:30,847 --> 01:16:31,871
Speaking of that

1269
01:16:32,639 --> 01:16:34,687
Domino's

1270
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:40,831
Almost into the shelter day folks

1271
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:42,111
Careerlink

1272
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:45,183
GI cancer

1273
01:16:45,951 --> 01:16:46,975
I'll be part of this

1274
01:16:51,327 --> 01:16:53,887
The first Domino to fall happened in Miami Florida

1275
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:56,959
Scarlxrd

1276
01:16:57,471 --> 01:16:59,519
What is that voice

1277
01:17:01,055 --> 01:17:02,335
Nationwide

1278
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:05,663
First Domino to fall exposing the poison backs

1279
01:17:06,687 --> 01:17:09,759
Yeah I would have just not done the show if I were him

1280
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:16,159
Option I would have done this I almost didn't do the show today he's got

1281
01:17:16,415 --> 01:17:17,951
How to get rid of that almost just start

1282
01:17:18,207 --> 01:17:18,975
Not doing the show

1283
01:17:20,255 --> 01:17:26,143
I think it's really weird to me is it like he was holding it together just fine for a bit was even having fun when he was rich

1284
01:17:26,399 --> 01:17:28,191
Sing about Jack wanted to have sex with animals

1285
01:17:28,447 --> 01:17:29,727
But now he is f****** lost

1286
01:17:29,983 --> 01:17:36,127
What's Bette Midler comes into play it all off the table buddy his mood swings are so intense it's kind of scary

1287
01:17:36,383 --> 01:17:39,199
To see how much things fluctuate just in the span of a few hours

1288
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:41,503
F*** it lost

1289
01:17:41,759 --> 01:17:45,855
Oh man hey hey Alex is really great to hang out with just one

1290
01:17:46,111 --> 01:17:47,135
Just wanting to let you know

1291
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:49,183
You don't have a bad night

1292
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:50,463
And all you got to do.

1293
01:17:50,975 --> 01:17:51,487
Avoid

1294
01:17:51,743 --> 01:17:52,255
Bat

1295
01:17:52,511 --> 01:17:54,559
Midler

1296
01:17:54,815 --> 01:17:55,327
Don't bring

1297
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:56,351
Her up

1298
01:17:56,607 --> 01:17:57,375
Okay

1299
01:17:59,167 --> 01:17:59,679
I don't

1300
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:01,471
Think necessarily

1301
01:18:01,983 --> 01:18:02,495
This is

1302
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:07,615
Like a drug or stimulant but I do know that people I have known

1303
01:18:07,871 --> 01:18:09,407
Who did a lot of cocaine

1304
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:12,735
We're certainly inconsistent in their mood that is true

1305
01:18:12,991 --> 01:18:17,855
That is true now a lot of Bette Midler fans I know also inconsistent with her mood

1306
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:18,879
Fair enough

1307
01:18:19,391 --> 01:18:21,951
So In that clip he's also saying like

1308
01:18:22,463 --> 01:18:23,487
First Domino has

1309
01:18:23,743 --> 01:18:24,255
Fallen

1310
01:18:24,511 --> 01:18:27,839
I like what the hell does that mean it means what you think it means

1311
01:18:28,351 --> 01:18:34,495
It means the first dominoes fall in love the one that's going to set it up here to Domino though

1312
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:35,263
Affiliate

1313
01:18:35,519 --> 01:18:39,359
There was a there was a tiger that attacked no

1314
01:18:41,407 --> 01:18:42,687
We already lost the contest

1315
01:18:43,967 --> 01:18:45,503
Thousand dollars

1316
01:18:55,743 --> 01:18:58,559
Watch the Infowars

1317
01:18:59,583 --> 01:19:00,863
Infowars

1318
01:19:01,375 --> 01:19:02,143
Photobomb

1319
01:19:05,471 --> 01:19:07,519
Horse photobomb challenge has begun

1320
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:10,335
That's the first album

1321
01:19:16,991 --> 01:19:20,319
By the way people say like junky sound drunk right now I'm not drinking right now

1322
01:19:20,831 --> 01:19:23,135
Right now

1323
01:19:23,647 --> 01:19:25,183
Hammered as hell right now

1324
01:19:25,695 --> 01:19:31,839
I honestly didn't think Alex was drunk until he said he wasn't

1325
01:19:32,095 --> 01:19:38,239
Doesn't seem like drunk Alex

1326
01:19:38,495 --> 01:19:39,263
Like you don't need

1327
01:19:39,519 --> 01:19:43,359
Substances relayed you've got that under control

1328
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:55,391
I want to do another contest which is basically just in desperately trying to pay people to promote his website by disrupting live news report

1329
01:19:56,159 --> 01:20:00,255
If the goal were really just a wake-up Republican to dispose dangers of the covid shot

1330
01:20:00,511 --> 01:20:03,839
You'd expect to see that you know what a person needed to yell on camera to get

1331
01:20:04,095 --> 01:20:05,631
Get the prizes just yelling about

1332
01:20:05,887 --> 01:20:06,399
Now covid

1333
01:20:06,655 --> 01:20:08,447
It's not what they do

1334
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:13,567
Need to do they also need to kill infowars.com if they want to get their money because that's what this is all about

1335
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:17,920
I understand but Alex is desperate for attention and anything you can monetize right now

1336
01:20:18,176 --> 01:20:19,968
Seems like a poor use of resources

1337
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:25,856
He's going on about how like in forward might shut down in a matter of months if people don't buy a ton of his products

1338
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:28,672
Turns around does a stupid publicity stunt like this

1339
01:20:28,928 --> 01:20:29,952
It seems like mixed message

1340
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:36,864
I don't I don't know I think it's a bad idea you know I mean on the other hand if your if

1341
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:39,424
You're fairly certain you're going to lose everything shortly

1342
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:44,288
F****** Brewster's Millions it you know like just start throwing money away

1343
01:20:45,056 --> 01:20:50,944
Toss it out the window and I guess I get that but what kind of a message does that send to the audio I'm broke

1344
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:57,344
So I'm going to give you money

1345
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:59,904
Listening and I believe anything you said I would be very can

1346
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:02,464
As far as an advertising strategy goes

1347
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:04,256
Exactly how would you analyze the ra

1348
01:21:04,512 --> 01:21:05,280
Return-on-investment

1349
01:21:06,304 --> 01:21:07,072
$5,000

1350
01:21:07,328 --> 01:21:10,400
Like are you are you getting

1351
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:11,680
Increase traffic

1352
01:21:12,448 --> 01:21:15,264
I mean you'd have them figure out how much of that traffic is

1353
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:17,056
Play oh yeah

1354
01:21:17,312 --> 01:21:20,640
I don't know. Or at least it must be

1355
01:21:20,896 --> 01:21:22,432
Buy beneficial thing cuz he's done this

1356
01:21:22,688 --> 01:21:26,016
These contest again

1357
01:21:26,272 --> 01:21:32,416
That was apparently pretty successful the first did not work as well

1358
01:21:32,672 --> 01:21:33,952
I said mouthful

1359
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:36,256
I don't know

1360
01:21:36,512 --> 01:21:39,072
Good luck

1361
01:21:39,584 --> 01:21:43,680
That's the first Domino

1362
01:21:43,936 --> 01:21:48,544
Kind of

1363
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:52,896
He knows that we know it let's get this more headline okay

1364
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:55,968
Some of these headlines are just unbelievable

1365
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:03,648
Intel CEO at Albans help with weights

1366
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:11,584
Okay go for that

1367
01:22:22,336 --> 01:22:24,128
Uuu read Men's Health

1368
01:22:25,664 --> 01:22:27,456
Wonderful

1369
01:22:29,504 --> 01:22:32,576
Men taking hormone so they can breastfeed us

1370
01:22:34,368 --> 01:22:35,648
Whatever the hell that means

1371
01:22:37,952 --> 01:22:41,536
It's harsh

1372
01:22:46,656 --> 01:22:47,680
Couple of drops of milk a day

1373
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:51,264
It doesn't matter

1374
01:22:53,568 --> 01:22:57,408
I'll get you ready for this alien world of theirs clones

1375
01:22:58,688 --> 01:23:00,736
Oh there's GMO

1376
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:06,624
Animal-human hybrids others transgender others aliens oh there's aliens

1377
01:23:07,136 --> 01:23:08,160
Oh boy

1378
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:13,536
First of all this article about romance health is published in October 2018

1379
01:23:13,792 --> 01:23:16,608
No idea why this is one of big news items he's gone for today

1380
01:23:17,376 --> 01:23:23,520
How to take every opportunity to attack trans people but it's not even about Transpo

1381
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:30,176
This is about somebody who invented hormone kit that men can take while their partner is pregnant in order to make it so they can assist their paw

1382
01:23:30,432 --> 01:23:31,968
Partner difficulty breast

1383
01:23:32,992 --> 01:23:35,296
They would then stop taking hormones once the baby was done

1384
01:23:36,064 --> 01:23:41,440
Alex wants to be a competent bigot like he represents himself as he needs to try a little harder

1385
01:23:41,952 --> 01:23:44,512
Misreporting articles from over 3 years ago just nice

1386
01:23:45,536 --> 01:23:49,120
This is sad I mean now that I know it's possible

1387
01:23:49,376 --> 01:23:50,144
4

1388
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:50,912
You to take

1389
01:23:51,168 --> 01:23:52,192
Hormone

1390
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:54,752
Breastfeed

1391
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:56,544
I'm okay with clones

1392
01:23:57,312 --> 01:24:01,408
Aliens all of this stuff now that I've seen that

1393
01:24:01,664 --> 01:24:05,760
Absolutely I'm prepared

1394
01:24:06,016 --> 01:24:07,040
For cloning

1395
01:24:08,064 --> 01:24:09,600
Only but only for breastfeed

1396
01:24:09,856 --> 01:24:11,648
I only want to clone myself

1397
01:24:11,904 --> 01:24:15,488
Have that person take the hormones and then breastfeed

1398
01:24:15,744 --> 01:24:16,256
For me

1399
01:24:16,512 --> 01:24:17,536
Yeah surrogate breast

1400
01:24:19,328 --> 01:24:22,144
You know we're not dealing with a lot of great news here today

1401
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:23,424
Knock knock

1402
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:25,984
Not really on the ball

1403
01:24:26,496 --> 01:24:27,776
Look Alex can't even

1404
01:24:28,032 --> 01:24:30,080
Plug without being a depressing MO

1405
01:24:30,592 --> 01:24:31,104
Cuz I guess he's

1406
01:24:31,616 --> 01:24:33,408
Upset about that meddler still

1407
01:24:33,664 --> 01:24:37,248
I don't do this won't be here so let me just do this now

1408
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:40,320
Couple big announcements here

1409
01:24:47,744 --> 01:24:49,280
I need text Pam off

1410
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:55,168
Show close to Brian Stone so long

1411
01:25:00,544 --> 01:25:02,592
I want to trade a big conspiracy

1412
01:25:04,128 --> 01:25:05,152
Gone for a while

1413
01:25:06,688 --> 01:25:07,200
But

1414
01:25:08,992 --> 01:25:10,784
You know this point is to

1415
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:12,832
Play Civ

1416
01:25:13,088 --> 01:25:14,112
What are you going to do

1417
01:25:15,392 --> 01:25:17,184
Baton do you know

1418
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:21,024
Cool maybe I'll just be gone a month baby 5 years

1419
01:25:22,304 --> 01:25:23,840
Maybe I'll walk out of here tomorrow

1420
01:25:24,096 --> 01:25:25,120
And you never see me again

1421
01:25:31,264 --> 01:25:32,800
My time is almost over

1422
01:25:34,848 --> 01:25:36,384
My stories are almost over

1423
01:25:38,176 --> 01:25:38,944
You can nap

1424
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:41,504
What's the fucken Miss Bartlett bones

1425
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:43,296
You won't think that's traumatic

1426
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:45,856
Once you figure out it's real but

1427
01:25:48,928 --> 01:25:50,976
Paradox

1428
01:25:51,744 --> 01:25:54,048
It is a paradox

1429
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:55,328
Everything is a paradox

1430
01:25:55,584 --> 01:25:56,608
Everything

1431
01:25:56,864 --> 01:25:58,144
Everything

1432
01:25:59,168 --> 01:26:05,312
That's what he eats like I better quit I would have never come back here but also I need you to buy my products

1433
01:26:05,568 --> 01:26:06,336
A paradox

1434
01:26:06,848 --> 01:26:07,360
Eighth grade

1435
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:09,152
Alex

1436
01:26:09,408 --> 01:26:10,176
This is Ethan

1437
01:26:10,432 --> 01:26:11,456
Is in a bad mood

1438
01:26:12,736 --> 01:26:13,504
Houston record

01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:16,320
Spa for the first time ever using a certain

1440
01:26:16,576 --> 01:26:17,088
Stayokay

1441
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:18,624
And holy spirit is now

1442
01:26:19,392 --> 01:26:20,928
Literally showing me

1443
01:26:21,696 --> 01:26:22,720
Alex Jones is in

1444
01:26:24,256 --> 01:26:25,024
I exit

1445
01:26:25,792 --> 01:26:27,072
No longer on are gone

1446
01:26:28,352 --> 01:26:31,424
Well I better do some good broadcaster attend

1447
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:33,728
What I'm going to do

1448
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:38,080
Maybe not.

1449
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:41,664
1 foot already out of this because

1450
01:26:42,432 --> 01:26:44,736
You're going to have to deal with this yourself out there

1451
01:26:47,808 --> 01:26:50,624
I want a beer do you want to happen

1452
01:26:51,648 --> 01:26:52,416
But I won't

1453
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:56,768
Can ever come back to the studio again and leave

1454
01:26:58,304 --> 01:26:59,584
That's what's going to happen folks

1455
01:27:03,936 --> 01:27:07,264
Every broadcast you watch every broadcast you she may be my last

1456
01:27:10,336 --> 01:27:11,360
Whatever happens

1457
01:27:11,616 --> 01:27:13,664
I want to try to stay as long as possible

1458
01:27:19,296 --> 01:27:20,064
Conspiracy

1459
01:27:20,576 --> 01:27:22,112
That's amazing

1460
01:27:22,368 --> 01:27:22,880
God

1461
01:27:23,136 --> 01:27:29,280
Just look I'm out of here the Holy Spirit showing me my end every show might be my last one but also we got to say a lot

1462
01:27:29,792 --> 01:27:32,096
Just the idea that somebody is listening

1463
01:27:32,864 --> 01:27:33,888
And was like oh

1464
01:27:35,424 --> 01:27:37,728
Almost forgot what I was planning to buy

1465
01:27:37,984 --> 01:27:38,496
Yeah

1466
01:27:38,752 --> 01:27:39,264
Jesus

1467
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:41,568
Oh man yes

1468
01:27:41,824 --> 01:27:44,128
So that's that's a lot of fun he's a lot of fun

1469
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:46,688
Yeah that's great that's great

1470
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:48,992
There's just so much to enjoy in there

1471
01:27:49,248 --> 01:27:51,808
Is a sweat out the door

1472
01:27:52,064 --> 01:27:54,880
What time it is entire career

1473
01:27:55,136 --> 01:28:00,000
I would argue that in my experience of the door number of times

1474
01:28:00,256 --> 01:28:02,816
Yeah I would say he's been noncommittal

1475
01:28:03,072 --> 01:28:09,216
And a little bit detached at times yearly yearly

1476
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:16,384
Having seen stuff like this in the past from Alex severe

1477
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:22,528
17 things like this in the past I look back on those in like I thought there was meaning in it

1478
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:29,184
And I don't think there's meaning in the battery is just Alex's in a bad mood

1479
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:31,744
He's really not doing well no I mean

1480
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,280
Yeah that sucks

1481
01:28:33,792 --> 01:28:35,840
That sucks that you're in a situation

1482
01:28:36,096 --> 01:28:36,608
Where

1483
01:28:37,376 --> 01:28:38,912
You can't even be

1484
01:28:39,168 --> 01:28:40,960
You can't even rely on just being profession

1485
01:28:41,216 --> 01:28:41,728
You know

1486
01:28:41,984 --> 01:28:48,128
Like I'm sure you do if your on TV you have bad days and sometimes you got to go to work and be on camera

1487
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:56,064
What you do is you go to a different place and you just rely on professionalism this is Alex's profession

1488
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:58,112
It's it's that he does

1489
01:28:58,368 --> 01:29:03,488
This is what he's got he's being miserable so people can see it

1490
01:29:04,768 --> 01:29:05,280
Yeah

1491
01:29:05,536 --> 01:29:07,328
Even still think it's a bit performed

1492
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:09,888
It's not like

1493
01:29:10,144 --> 01:29:16,288
He's having a bad time and so he's sincerely bearing his heart

1494
01:29:17,568 --> 01:29:21,408
You know somebody who allows the lot of authenticity in their public

1495
01:29:21,664 --> 01:29:26,016
Presentation of themselves I think there's some value in that although

1496
01:29:26,272 --> 01:29:31,904
You know it's probably a tough thing to do that's not what he's doing this is a guy who's really

1497
01:29:32,416 --> 01:29:33,696
This is melodramatic

1498
01:29:33,952 --> 01:29:37,024
Yeah we started this with a 30%

1499
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:43,424
I was going to say this is this is a little bit over-the-top he said I wasn't actually thinking of quitting

1500
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:45,472
Hey we've anybody doing cocaine that day

1501
01:29:45,984 --> 01:29:46,752
Probably not

1502
01:29:47,008 --> 01:29:47,776
So

1503
01:29:48,544 --> 01:29:51,872
He's going to get himself back in the mood

1504
01:29:52,128 --> 01:29:53,152
The headline of

1505
01:29:53,408 --> 01:29:53,920

01:30:04,672 --> 01:30:06,208
Think about what goes into that

1508
01:30:07,232 --> 01:30:08,512
Beatles

1509
01:30:09,024 --> 01:30:12,096
Now stop this

1510
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:13,888
And then it goes on

1511
01:30:17,984 --> 01:30:20,032

1513
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:24,128

Full

1524
01:30:53,312 --> 01:30:54,848
Hard to deal with

1525
01:30:55,104 --> 01:30:57,920
Do you blame the general public for not being able to

1526
01:30:58,432 --> 01:30:58,944
Stand it

1527
01:31:03,552 --> 01:31:06,624
The public's dumb.

1528
01:31:07,392 --> 01:31:09,184
But weird okay

1529
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:10,720

And the people that decided you're not the leader

1563

And serving these fraud

1573
01:33:23,328 --> 01:33:25,632
You said you're going to be safe in a societal tool

1574
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:28,448
That you're going to organize and control

1575
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:32,288
With you

1576
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:35,872

Totally in the Stream of the man the woman together

1584
01:34:03,776 --> 01:34:04,288
In Paradise

1585
01:34:05,824 --> 01:34:06,848
You don't understand that

1586
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:08,128
You don't

1587
01:34:08,384 --> 01:34:10,432
Try to give everybody else Paradise

1588
01:34:10,688 --> 01:34:12,224
God blesses you down the toilet

1589
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:16,832
Wait what what is happening are you for redistribution of wealth

1590
01:34:17,088 --> 01:34:18,880
Absolute banana salad

1591
01:34:19,136 --> 01:34:20,928
This is a whole f****** mess

1592
01:34:22,208 --> 01:34:28,352
Garbled nonsense hot lady on a boat

1593
01:34:28,608 --> 01:34:29,376
You know what that's fine

1594
01:34:30,912 --> 01:34:34,496
I don't know what this is is having a tough day

1595
01:34:35,008 --> 01:34:37,568
Alex earlier said the people might think he's drunk

1596
01:34:37,824 --> 01:34:41,152
But he's not he's not on the Holy Spirit someone else

1597
01:34:41,408 --> 01:34:42,432
Decided that maybe he's wrong

1598
01:34:49,088 --> 01:34:50,880
Literally completely freaked out

1599
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:57,024
115 this morning about 10 p.m.

1600
01:34:57,536 --> 01:34:59,328
Just so upset I mean

1601
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:02,912
Houma good sign man like whether you're drunk or not

1602
01:35:03,168 --> 01:35:03,680
It's a bad sign

1603
01:35:03,936 --> 01:35:06,496
Crew member asks if he's drunk

1604
01:35:06,752 --> 01:35:09,312
That's an indication that the crew member is noticing

1605
01:35:09,568 --> 01:35:10,336
Behaving in ways

1606
01:35:10,592 --> 01:35:13,408
They're similar to have someone might be impaired if they were drunk

1607
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:14,688
Also I'm

1608
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:16,224
Getting suspicious

1609
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:16,992
A little

1610
01:35:17,248 --> 01:35:22,368
Alex is being really defensive about not being drunk but I still don't think it is babe your matches how we usually Act

1611
01:35:22,624 --> 01:35:23,392
When he's f***** up

1612
01:35:23,648 --> 01:35:27,488
Just to be like a depressed dude maybe he's going through withdrawals or something

1613
01:35:27,744 --> 01:35:28,256
Yeah

1614
01:35:28,512 --> 01:35:29,792
That I could buy

1615
01:35:30,048 --> 01:35:31,840
Alcohol withdrawal

1616
01:35:32,096 --> 01:35:33,888
Like that that kind of inconsistent

1617
01:35:34,656 --> 01:35:35,168
Possible

1618
01:35:35,424 --> 01:35:35,936
I mean

1619
01:35:36,448 --> 01:35:37,472
Yeah if you don't

1620
01:35:37,728 --> 01:35:38,752
Understand that the quest

1621
01:35:39,776 --> 01:35:40,800
When somebody says

1622
01:35:41,056 --> 01:35:41,824
Hey Alex

1623
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:42,848
Are you drunk

1624
01:35:43,616 --> 01:35:44,128
Is

1625
01:35:44,384 --> 01:35:46,176
Moore and accusation

1626
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:47,712
Of

1627
01:35:47,968 --> 01:35:50,272
Poor behavior and it is like a

1628
01:35:50,784 --> 01:35:52,064
Concern like hey Alex

1629
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:52,832
Are you drunk

1630
01:35:53,088 --> 01:35:54,624
How are you doing so well

1631
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:57,184
No

1632
01:35:57,440 --> 01:35:59,488
Somebody asks you if you're drunk like

1633
01:35:59,744 --> 01:36:05,888
You better answer better be yes because if you're not then your behavior is right in some way

1634
01:36:06,144 --> 01:36:08,192
Yeah that's the point of that question

1635
01:36:08,448 --> 01:36:11,008
He's not drunk but you might quit

1636
01:36:12,032 --> 01:36:14,848
How many fours will continue on that maybe I should just

1637
01:36:16,896 --> 01:36:17,408
Do it

1638
01:36:17,664 --> 01:36:18,176
Do it

1639
01:36:19,968 --> 01:36:21,504
Solace coming in tomorrow

1640
01:36:26,368 --> 01:36:32,512
Everybody else Houston I'm stuck

1641
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:39,168
Really

1642
01:36:43,264 --> 01:36:46,848
This might be the end folks you constantly say things were traumatic

1643
01:36:47,104 --> 01:36:49,152
But like I kind of agree with him

1644
01:36:49,408 --> 01:36:50,176
Really I think he's

1645
01:36:50,688 --> 01:36:55,296
Gotten to the end of his usefulness is not really that affect

1646
01:36:55,552 --> 01:36:57,856
Steve as a conspiracy theorist

1647
01:36:58,368 --> 01:37:00,160
He's full of s***

1648
01:37:01,696 --> 01:37:07,072
He's not making enough money to continue behaving the way he is right with consequences mounting

1649
01:37:07,328 --> 01:37:08,352
Exactly

1650
01:37:08,608 --> 01:37:14,752
Yeah maybe he has outlived his his usefulness is really coming to the end

1651
01:37:15,008 --> 01:37:15,776
End of something that I

1652
01:37:16,032 --> 01:37:16,544
Spence

1653
01:37:17,056 --> 01:37:18,336
30 years really

1654
01:37:18,848 --> 01:37:19,616
All told

1655
01:37:19,872 --> 01:37:20,384
Building

1656
01:37:20,896 --> 01:37:21,408
You know

1657
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:22,432
And

1658
01:37:22,688 --> 01:37:26,016
Realizing that what I was leaving behind was a legacy

1659
01:37:26,528 --> 01:37:27,552
But also I'm

1660
01:37:27,808 --> 01:37:30,624
I'm still going to be alive for another 40 years or whatever

1661
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:31,648
I mean analysis

1662
01:37:31,904 --> 01:37:32,416
Suitcase who knows

1663
01:37:32,928 --> 01:37:33,696
But like

1664
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:35,744
That's a real bummer

1665
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:42,144
You know you don't want to go what is he going to do after this is going to do something after this is not going to build a new thing

1666
01:37:42,912 --> 01:37:44,448
His his achievement

1667
01:37:45,216 --> 01:37:45,984
Haze over

1668
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:51,104
And he still has to keep on living you know it's like it's like it's like Neil

1669
01:37:51,872 --> 01:37:53,408
I disagree he could go back to his roots

1670
01:37:54,176 --> 01:37:55,968
Do Public Access TV

1671
01:37:57,504 --> 01:38:02,112
I want that I would like some

1672
01:38:02,368 --> 01:38:06,208
Public Access television station

1673
01:38:06,464 --> 01:38:08,256
After this many years bill I cannot

1674
01:38:08,512 --> 01:38:10,048
Looks like a fly rod

1675
01:38:10,304 --> 01:38:12,096
Slot

1676
01:38:12,352 --> 01:38:13,376
Awesome

1677
01:38:13,632 --> 01:38:15,424
So what maybe he's not supposed to be on there

1678
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:16,704
Maybe that's the deal

1679
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:20,544
Definitely

1680
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:21,568
Generally

1681
01:38:21,824 --> 01:38:27,968
It's debatable maybe it's time for me to do something else

1682
01:38:28,224 --> 01:38:28,736
Priority

1683
01:38:30,272 --> 01:38:32,320
Supposed to be on air and the time is coming

1684
01:38:41,024 --> 01:38:41,792
I just need

1685
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:46,912
That's all

1686
01:38:47,424 --> 01:38:48,704
Almost

1687
01:38:51,776 --> 01:38:53,568
In the murder of our children

1688
01:38:53,824 --> 01:38:54,848
Chronicling the death

1689
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:09,184
I don't know but he better start playing notorious b.i.g.

1690
01:39:09,952 --> 01:39:11,488
Maybe I shouldn't be on there because there's

1691
01:39:11,744 --> 01:39:15,584
More important things like preparing to die Paradise

1692
01:39:16,352 --> 01:39:22,496
Prepare to die.

1693
01:39:22,752 --> 01:39:24,032
I don't know

1694
01:39:24,288 --> 01:39:25,056
On on

1695
01:39:25,312 --> 01:39:26,336
On this Thursday show

1696
01:39:26,592 --> 01:39:32,736
Mediately comes in a bad mood I wasn't ever really going to quit and I wasn't saying that

1697
01:39:32,992 --> 01:39:39,136
A dramatic effect

1698
01:39:39,392 --> 01:39:39,904
Drunken

1699
01:39:40,416 --> 01:39:46,304
Weekend dad at 3:30 a.m. waking his kids up with thoughts that they need to know

1700
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:48,864
I promised calls

1701
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:50,144
He said he was going to go to the calls

1702
01:39:51,168 --> 01:39:51,936
Maybe not

1703
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:53,984
I take phone calls

1704
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:05,248
Because here's the deal

1705
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:07,808
Pop-up Infowars

1706
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:12,928
But hasn't Infowars countdown at work

1707
01:40:14,464 --> 01:40:18,048
Yeah

1708
01:40:19,328 --> 01:40:20,864
I'm gone

1709
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:25,216
Then the crew can organize and what I'm going to do a r

1710
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:30,080
Maybe that'll give him a great job

1711
01:40:46,464 --> 01:40:47,232
I walked out here today

1712
01:40:47,744 --> 01:40:48,256
Okay

1713
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:53,888
F*** this place I swear I swear the only the only ultimate torture for Alex

1714
01:40:54,144 --> 01:40:54,656
This is just

1715
01:40:54,912 --> 01:40:56,192
He should have to work in an office

1716
01:40:56,448 --> 01:40:58,240
Like a regular old office

1717
01:40:58,752 --> 01:41:00,288
Just be an employee

1718
01:41:00,544 --> 01:41:01,824
Take makeup

1719
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:03,360
Price of Stucco boss

1720
01:41:03,616 --> 01:41:04,640
Just f****** half

1721
01:41:04,896 --> 01:41:05,408
To deliver

1722
01:41:05,664 --> 01:41:07,456
Male you know just work

1723
01:41:07,712 --> 01:41:13,856
The thing that I find particularly hilarious about theirs is this whole like preoccupation with I'm walking out of here I'm never coming back

1724
01:41:14,368 --> 01:41:17,696
He still finishing the show

1725
01:41:17,952 --> 01:41:20,000
I'm going to get out of here I've got

1726
01:41:20,256 --> 01:41:21,792
25 minutes late

1727
01:41:22,048 --> 01:41:28,192
I'm a broadcast

1728
01:41:28,704 --> 01:41:32,800
So stupid that's Chicago comedy all the way through

1729
01:41:33,056 --> 01:41:39,200
You know one of the reasons that he thinks that it's probably time to hang it up is kind of sound

1730
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:43,808
Sensible in some ways but I think if you actually look at it

1731
01:41:44,064 --> 01:41:45,856
It's really revealing and damning

1732
01:41:51,232 --> 01:41:53,024
Cuz I mean

1733
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:59,424
Entertainment to talk about them murdering children and masks with GMO gene therapy

1734
01:42:10,432 --> 01:42:11,200
Facade

1735
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:15,808
I can do that for

1736
01:42:16,064 --> 01:42:22,208
Show is entertainment at part that entertainment is him pretending to cover stories by reading headlines

1737
01:42:22,464 --> 01:42:23,744
Yelling about whatever you think they mean

1738
01:42:24,256 --> 01:42:28,608
Don't pretend to be a journalist but that's just part of the entertainment of the show that's basically the

1739
01:42:28,864 --> 01:42:32,192
Wouldn't it be funny if a journalist did these days

1740
01:42:32,448 --> 01:42:34,752
I mean I don't think you would put it that way

1741
01:42:35,008 --> 01:42:38,336
Now that he's sensationalize is narratives to the point where everyone is

1742
01:42:38,592 --> 01:42:40,128
Constantly about to die

1743
01:42:40,384 --> 01:42:42,432
He's doing a little bit elevated

1744
01:42:42,944 --> 01:42:45,504
If you sincerely believe that these vaccines are designed

1745
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:48,320
The kill all the children in America and no one

1746
01:42:48,576 --> 01:42:52,928
House with the size platform that you have is covering it you have an obligation to go

1747
01:42:53,184 --> 01:42:56,000
Then do it really serious job and Report out that information

1748
01:42:56,512 --> 01:42:59,584
If you believe that stuff there really isn't time for entertainment

1749
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:01,632
It's time to do some serious work where you get into

1750
01:43:01,888 --> 01:43:03,168
The details new prove claims

1751
01:43:03,936 --> 01:43:04,960
Alex doesn't want to do that

1752
01:43:05,216 --> 01:43:06,496
Because he's lazy

1753
01:43:06,752 --> 01:43:09,824
Buddy's back corner where is narratives are so serious

1754
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:11,616
That they demand actual work

1755
01:43:12,128 --> 01:43:17,248
Always capable of doing is entertaining The Ellen Show are you pretending to be reporter

1756
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:18,528
I want to quit

1757
01:43:18,784 --> 01:43:19,552
If I were him

1758
01:43:20,064 --> 01:43:21,088
There aren't a ton of good options

1759
01:43:21,344 --> 01:43:24,416
Looking for him moving forward with the narrative said that he's built in the audience

1760
01:43:24,672 --> 01:43:25,952
That believes those narratives

1761
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:29,024
Probably isn't the best audience for him to have anymore

1762
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:32,864
Believe that the vaccines are designed to kill all the children

1763
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:36,448
Are going to get really suspicious if you profess to believe that too

1764
01:43:36,704 --> 01:43:39,776
And you don't Advocate taking up arms against the people pushing the vaccine

1765
01:43:40,544 --> 01:43:43,872
Things got too real into immediate for him infowar

1766
01:43:44,640 --> 01:43:49,504
It's easy to get away with profiting off preaching Doom that's coming at some undetermined point

1767
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:50,272
The future

1768
01:43:50,784 --> 01:43:55,904
Got to be super exhausted after trying to convince an audience that is constantly happening right now

1769
01:43:56,160 --> 01:43:57,440
But also you shouldn't do the things

1770
01:43:57,952 --> 01:44:00,000
That would make sense to do FaceTime

1771
01:44:00,256 --> 01:44:03,072
I mean it's ridiculous the problem of escalation when

1772
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:04,352
Down to it every

1773
01:44:05,888 --> 01:44:06,912
10 years ago

1774
01:44:07,168 --> 01:44:07,680
Hey

1775
01:44:08,192 --> 01:44:08,704
There's a

1776
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:10,752
Economic collapse coming

1777
01:44:11,008 --> 01:44:12,288
It's going to be December 8th

1778
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:13,568
It's going to be there

1779
01:44:13,824 --> 01:44:15,104
You got to invest in gold

1780
01:44:15,360 --> 01:44:18,432
That is a far more sustainable message then

1781
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:25,344
The government's murdering you in your sleep right now and everything you do is only taking you one step towards death

1782
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:29,696
Is the devil

1783
01:44:30,208 --> 01:44:32,256
My enemies my political enemies

1784
01:44:32,512 --> 01:44:37,376
It will mean the damnation of your Eternal symbol

1785
01:44:37,632 --> 01:44:40,192
It's still going to be a good time to invest in gold

1786
01:44:40,448 --> 01:44:40,960
Probably

1787
01:44:41,216 --> 01:44:44,288
Or at least that silver coin it was a war bond

1788
01:44:44,544 --> 01:44:45,056
Exactly

1789
01:44:46,848 --> 01:44:48,384
I just think this is ridiculous

1790
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:51,456
Entertainment anymore

1791
01:44:51,712 --> 01:44:55,040
Is not a thing that someone like Alex Jones should ever be allowed to yell

1792
01:44:55,552 --> 01:45:00,160
He's supposed to be the person who has this access to a greater truth than anybody else

1793
01:45:00,416 --> 01:45:02,464
See-through the news

1794
01:45:02,720 --> 01:45:08,096
And give you like all the stuff that they're hiding you knows all the real reality who got deep sources

1795
01:45:08,352 --> 01:45:10,400
Not supposed to be entertaining

1796
01:45:10,656 --> 01:45:14,752
Yeah and when you're talkin about all this covid conspiracies that he's been spending forever

1797
01:45:15,008 --> 01:45:16,544
That's never been

1798
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:18,080
No effect

1799
01:45:18,336 --> 01:45:18,848
The people's lot

1800
01:45:20,128 --> 01:45:26,272
Yeah you don't want that you don't want the next episode of The Simpsons to that have them be like listen honestly this is kind of been shity for the

1801
01:45:26,528 --> 01:45:27,296
The last 10 years

1802
01:45:28,832 --> 01:45:29,856
We had a good run

1803
01:45:30,368 --> 01:45:32,672
We had a good run I don't even know if I want to do this

1804
01:45:32,928 --> 01:45:34,208
Eat my shorts again

1805
01:45:34,464 --> 01:45:36,000
Again

1806
01:45:36,256 --> 01:45:36,768
Really

1807

1808
01:45:43,424 --> 01:45:44,704
Rockford last few weeks

1809
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:47,264
Runaway Baby it's time to hang it up yeah

1810
01:45:47,776 --> 01:45:50,080
Maybe my time on air is over

1811
01:45:53,664 --> 01:45:55,712
Now maybe it's about what are you going

1812
01:45:57,504 --> 01:45:58,528
What are you going to say

1813
01:46:04,416 --> 01:46:05,696
Let's talk about something positive

1814
01:46:09,024 --> 01:46:10,560
This is Stefan Rivera

1815
01:46:12,096 --> 01:46:13,120
Fun

1816
01:46:17,216 --> 01:46:21,056
Draper

1817
01:46:23,104 --> 01:46:29,248
I already did this yeah that's the good news that's the good news let's sit let's switch over to some good

1818
01:46:29,504 --> 01:46:33,856
Good news somebody did a little thing for me and I paid them

1819
01:46:36,160 --> 01:46:38,976
ABC7

1820
01:46:39,488 --> 01:46:41,280
Man talk about Silver Linings

1821
01:46:41,536 --> 01:46:42,304
Sure

1822
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:43,328
It's been a bad day

1823
01:46:43,584 --> 01:46:44,608
You're all going to die

1824
01:46:44,864 --> 01:46:50,240
And maybe you should maybe somebody was on ABC 6 though

1825
01:46:50,496 --> 01:46:56,128
Alex is talking about how the media

1826
01:46:56,640 --> 01:46:59,968
It was saying that he only said that he was going to Dish dirt on Trump

1827
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:02,528
Because he's afraid of the January 6th committee

1828
01:47:02,784 --> 01:47:03,296
And how like

1829
01:47:03,552 --> 01:47:05,856
He's trying to Curry favor by saying

1830
01:47:06,368 --> 01:47:11,744
I didn't see that I didn't see the media say that I don't imagine somebody tweeted it

1831
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:13,792
Maybe I believe that something someone

1832
01:47:14,048 --> 01:47:15,072
Might have to

1833
01:47:15,328 --> 01:47:17,376
I don't know if it was a large

1834
01:47:17,632 --> 01:47:21,728
Popular opinion yeah whatever it is you want to say somebody probably tweet

1835
01:47:21,984 --> 01:47:25,824
But Alex did in addition to this he recognized

1836
01:47:26,592 --> 01:47:29,920
It was all over the place are articles written about it

1837
01:47:30,176 --> 01:47:32,736
The dirt going to try

1838
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:42,976
All Droid recording me I'll just talk about Trump cuz

1839
01:47:47,328 --> 01:47:47,840
You know

1840
01:47:48,096 --> 01:47:50,400
What did what what the dirt is on Trump

1841
01:47:52,448 --> 01:47:53,216
What is

1842
01:47:53,472 --> 01:47:54,496
The dirt on Trump

1843
01:47:55,008 --> 01:47:56,288
Maybe I should wait till next week

1844
01:47:56,800 --> 01:47:58,592
Oh my God

1845
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:03,200
Trump

1846
01:48:04,736 --> 01:48:07,552
But to separate myself from him

1847
01:48:17,024 --> 01:48:19,072
Go to phone calls

1848
01:48:25,472 --> 01:48:29,056
Immune system your libido it is the missing length

1849
01:48:29,312 --> 01:48:33,152
Call my God

1850
01:48:33,408 --> 01:48:36,736
Yells at himself to get back to call Zoraida immediately doesn't clog

1851
01:48:36,992 --> 01:48:37,504
Let's do the work

1852
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:43,392
It doesn't break any comes back he does take some calls and he's like

1853
01:48:43,648 --> 01:48:44,672
Hey

1854
01:48:45,184 --> 01:48:49,536
Blackback 1/87 job and I take a break and I do get high always wondered if people

1855
01:48:49,792 --> 01:48:55,936
Could tell when I came back that I was high and

1856
01:48:57,984 --> 01:49:04,128
Alex is not happy about this

1857
01:49:05,664 --> 01:49:07,712
Reasons the eye of

1858
01:49:07,968 --> 01:49:12,320
Kind of open to the possibility that he was doing cocaine is because after this call

1859
01:49:13,856 --> 01:49:14,880
Please so like

1860
01:49:15,136 --> 01:49:21,280
Taken aback by it but he has to get Jason bermas in the control Booth or whatever

1861
01:49:24,096 --> 01:49:28,192
It seems like a strange response yet

1862
01:49:28,448 --> 01:49:31,264
To the suggestion that you're doing blow I mean

1863
01:49:31,520 --> 01:49:35,360
Seems like the hyper defensive suggestion if somebody who is doing something

1864
01:49:35,616 --> 01:49:38,432
Let's not blow I would prefer you didn't

1865
01:49:38,688 --> 01:49:43,040
Call it that Rogan talk to him but he was on his show about how he

1866
01:49:43,296 --> 01:49:45,088
Talk about having a problem with adderal

1867
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:46,368
And that's another

1868
01:49:46,624 --> 01:49:47,136
Stimulants

1869
01:49:47,392 --> 01:49:53,536
It's well within the possibility that he did something like that

1870
01:49:54,816 --> 01:49:55,328
Sure

1871
01:49:59,680 --> 01:50:03,776
Why not

1872
01:50:04,032 --> 01:50:04,544
Eden sucks

1873
01:50:05,824 --> 01:50:11,968
He's been gone for a long time without desperate times you need the heroes back my friend hit me who's the guy who made

1874
01:50:12,224 --> 01:50:12,992
Loose change

1875
01:50:13,504 --> 01:50:18,368
But he's old-school with Alex like you have any other shows

1876
01:50:18,624 --> 01:50:21,440
It was just his shadow even before the Nightly News

1877
01:50:21,696 --> 01:50:24,256
There was the info Warrior hosted by Jason Burnham

1878
01:50:24,512 --> 01:50:30,144
Damn like that this is what is he doing there when you're at your lowest

1879
01:50:30,400 --> 01:50:33,728
West Indies of the best friends from your past to come

1880
01:50:33,984 --> 01:50:34,496
To save your life

1881
01:50:34,752 --> 01:50:39,360
I guess he gets that call he has Jason vouch for him that he's not doing coke

1882
01:50:39,616 --> 01:50:42,944
Superman Alex goes back to calls and he gets a call from Bible Diane

1883
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:45,760
Greg wants to argue pre-trib rapture

1884
01:50:46,016 --> 01:50:47,040
Yeah baby

1885
01:50:50,368 --> 01:50:50,880
Crest

1886
01:50:51,136 --> 01:50:52,672
3 hour long

1887
01:50:53,440 --> 01:50:55,488
Whiny diatribe about how you

1888
01:50:55,744 --> 01:50:59,072
You don't want to do the only thing you've ever been good at

1889
01:50:59,328 --> 01:51:00,352
Yeah that's the time

1890
01:51:00,608 --> 01:51:04,960
The top pre-trib rap

1891
01:51:05,984 --> 01:51:07,264
Answer after that

1892
01:51:07,776 --> 01:51:11,872
Play fuk the calls I'm not doing this and you just interviews Jason bermas for a little bit

1893
01:51:12,896 --> 01:51:17,248
I disappointed I really do think that his best shot would be to actually dish

1894
01:51:17,504 --> 01:51:18,016
On Trump

1895
01:51:18,272 --> 01:51:23,904
You know but he probably doesn't have any anything that's why he gets to threaten it but

1896
01:51:24,160 --> 01:51:26,976
When he said he was going to Dish the dirt on Trump he did

1897
01:51:27,488 --> 01:51:29,792
And bet on the show he said the Trump

1898
01:51:30,048 --> 01:51:31,328
It doesn't know what he's doing

1899
01:51:31,584 --> 01:51:34,400
And the right thing about like multi-dimensional chace's bulshit

1900
01:51:34,656 --> 01:51:36,192
Right

1901
01:51:36,448 --> 01:51:40,544
That's not how it was presented on the episode

1902
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:46,944
Like the next hour I'm going to get the dirt something else

1903
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:52,320
We know the whole like a fifth dimensional you were saying that to

1904
01:51:52,576 --> 01:51:58,464
So you lied to your audience in order to over-inflate Trump as credibility

1905
01:51:58,976 --> 01:52:00,256
McKenna's

1906
01:52:00,512 --> 01:52:03,584
That's a good thing

1907
01:52:04,864 --> 01:52:05,632
Fix-It Atwood

1908
01:52:05,888 --> 01:52:07,168
Possibly be

1909
01:52:07,424 --> 01:52:08,960
Good for him to

1910
01:52:09,472 --> 01:52:09,984
Makeup

1911
01:52:12,544 --> 01:52:13,312
Why not

1912
01:52:13,568 --> 01:52:16,896
I mean it's like they've been they've moved on from

1913
01:52:17,408 --> 01:52:18,176
Come and gone

1914
01:52:18,688 --> 01:52:19,968
The Republican party is gone

1915
01:52:20,480 --> 01:52:22,528
It's just whatever these weirdos want to push now

1916
01:52:22,784 --> 01:52:23,808
That's it

1917
01:52:24,320 --> 01:52:24,832
Well I think

1918
01:52:25,088 --> 01:52:26,624
I think that a large

1919
01:52:27,904 --> 01:52:29,184
Very vocal block

1920
01:52:29,440 --> 01:52:31,744
Of the GOP base

1921
01:52:32,256 --> 01:52:32,768
He's perhaps

1922
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:34,304
What you're describing

1923
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:35,840
I don't know if it's uniform

1924
01:52:36,352 --> 01:52:38,656
But I lied about saying that it's not

1925
01:52:38,912 --> 01:52:43,776
I'm just putting the wheels of power now are not

1926
01:52:44,032 --> 01:52:45,824
People it's not Trump you know

1927
01:52:47,360 --> 01:52:48,896
Behind

1928
01:52:49,408 --> 01:52:50,944
Scary of rudderless

1929
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:51,712
Some terms of

1930
01:52:51,968 --> 01:52:53,760
Like some kind of a

1931
01:52:54,528 --> 01:52:56,064
Idea who's the leader of the party

1932
01:52:56,320 --> 01:52:58,112
Yeah there's no l there's only an enemy

1933
01:52:58,368 --> 01:52:59,392
That's not good

1934
01:52:59,904 --> 01:53:00,928
No now

1935
01:53:03,232 --> 01:53:09,376
Yeah he's a good time you showed up I didn't actually want to quit

1936
01:53:09,632 --> 01:53:13,216
Hey listen I know I spent 3 hours telling you that all of you deserve

1937
01:53:13,472 --> 01:53:16,288
Death for not supporting me

1938
01:53:16,544 --> 01:53:17,056
But

1939
01:53:17,312 --> 01:53:18,848
You know what

1940
01:53:19,104 --> 01:53:20,128
I'm feeling better today

1941
01:53:20,384 --> 01:53:21,664
Lucaya took a nap

1942
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:26,528
And I guess I forgot about that Midler and now

1943
01:53:27,040 --> 01:53:29,600
Got much better Friday shop

1944
01:53:35,232 --> 01:53:36,256

Get out go out with Alex

1949

So f****** overheat

1952
01:53:52,640 --> 01:53:58,272
Baby threatening to quit her show full of resignation and impotent rage

1953
01:53:58,528 --> 01:53:59,040
To fundraise

1954
01:53:59,296 --> 01:54:00,064
Yeah

1955

The current say goodbye

To last year

Yeah we'll have to figure out a while I was thinking that

1958
01:54:14,656 --> 01:54:16,704
