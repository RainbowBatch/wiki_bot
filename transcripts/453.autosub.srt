1
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:27,648
I have great respect for knowledge by now it's why I'm sick of them posing as if through the good guy

2
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:40,448
Need

3
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:56,320

Having fun and enjoying the small stuff

10
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:25,760
Little things like Michelle

11
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:32,160
Blowing my mind can be changed by just

12
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:34,208
Couple screws and elopements of wood

13
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:37,280
Really customized things

14
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:39,584
In that way that I've never really

15
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:44,448
I've never really done that with Apartments because I've always felt such

16
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:47,520
Such disdain

17
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:56,480
You just like relish that you came over I'm in the middle of building a little Shelf

18
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:58,272

Upcoming new planet watch

21
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,656
I don't know this is just Elementary stuff that probably should have

22
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:21,568
Again this is V like I learned how to cook a chicken breast

23
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:40,512

Redirected over to the teepublic store

30
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,400

We're going to cover two episodes today but it's all happened

36
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:52,704
Studio

37
00:03:54,240 --> 00:04:00,384
Delane Maxwell got arrested and he realized he had to come in

38
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,760
Gomn for some reason decided to come back and do another 2 hours at 7 evening

39
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:10,880
This is going to be a complete disaster thought I was parked

40
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:13,696
Going to be the walkthrough of mind that is to

41
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:14,720
Completely fractured

42
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:17,536
Okay I'm lost

43
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:23,423
It's um it's not Hatchet I'll tell you that

00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:27,519
Okay

45
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:33,407
Of course

46
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:39,807
Some talk about crimes against

47
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:47,743
Harden and awful for the entire time

48
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,279
Probably advise Maybe

49
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:51,071
You're sensitive about those sorts of topics

50
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,095
Maybe

51
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:55,423
Skip Law stay away from if you're sensitive

52
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:59,519
If that's all you want to hear will see you at the end

53
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,919
It's a book Zoo weather

54
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:06,943

I'm a policy wonk

61
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:41,503
Hold on

Kris Kristofferson

63
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:43,807
That right

64
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:44,575
I don't know

65
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:05,567
State of the school

66
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,359

00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,591
Money off that heroin

00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,431
Freakishly large

74
00:06:56,511 --> 00:07:02,655

75
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:09,055
Deliver to charity in your area

Rambo

77
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:13,407
Appreciate either of those

78
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:20,063

79
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:27,487
Some things are over our way in the mailbag I don't know if you see over there a little little little

80
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:31,839
Yeah this is from

81
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,887
She writes

82
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:42,079
These novelty beverage accessories

83
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:56,415
Put one of your wine bottles in

84
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:58,207
I meant also

85
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,743
Catherine

86
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:03,327
Sent us each of the oxygen

87
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:09,727
Singer

88
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,263
You end up getting sick

89
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,615
Along with this note

90
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,383
Dan

91
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,407
And then of course

92
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:24,063
Don't worry no one was to me and one was you

93
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,951
Most important

94
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:31,487
Which I hope you guys want

95
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:34,047
Your ass is getting me through a really tough time

96
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,839
Do you from Mary Catherine

97
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:42,239
Not a health Ranger thank you so much and we do also hope we don't

98
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:50,943
On the off-chance Rihanna and America

99
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:52,735
Zip

100
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,527
Mailbox close

101
00:08:56,319 --> 00:09:01,951
We're going to start here on July 2nd for the Regular Show

102
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,743
And

103
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:04,511
Course

104
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:08,607
Elaine Maxwell has been arrested

105
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:12,447
I really thought for sure this is going to be all he talked about

106
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:19,103
Pedophile ring stories

107
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:24,223
He talks about

108
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,015
Episode

109
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,111
Especially

110
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:38,303
Weather 2007 full spread

111
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,423
Tortured

112
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,215
Paintings

113
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:54,431
Cute little Corrections we did on

114
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:55,967
Pizzagate

115
00:09:56,223 --> 00:10:00,063
Little is carrying a lot of weight on that

116
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:02,111
Remember that about CNN

117
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:05,439
MSNBC

118
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,231
Megyn Kelly

119
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:12,095
Who made it their life's work try to destroy Infowars

120
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,399
We've been exposing

121
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:19,007
Specifically

122
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:20,799
That's interesting

123
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:26,687
Glam ironically little is probably the biggest

124
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:33,087
Sure sure Alex's story of what

125
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:36,415
Recovering to make the globalist Banning from social media

126
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,439
Change it

127
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:40,767
Just depends on whatever stories trying to pretend he's been right about forever

128
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:50,239
I guess that isn't the case goes against sexually because he

129
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:52,031
Covers

130
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:56,895
Alyssa cover FC news and they are not

131
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:57,663
Social media

132
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:04,319
It runs the gamut from Mainline reporters to podcast

133
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:08,671
See if she was embarrassed about the guardian of the entire newspaper website with

134
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:10,463
Was taken down

135
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:18,911
Do I search on this in the past but Alex did not talk about Jeffrey Epstein in his early career or if he did I can find

136
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,191
No evidence that he did

137
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:23,007
If you search for the name Epstein on Infowars

138
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,543
Specifically for articles post

139
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,847
Did prior to January 1st 2015

140
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,127
You'll get tons and

141
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,151
Tons of results

142
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:35,039
However these are articles with headlines like most Americans oppose health law but like provisions

143
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:35,807
Or

144
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:39,647
Florida holds fast to get to January 31st primary day

145
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:44,255
These articles have nothing to do with Epstein at all but the way and forwards website is built

146
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,791
Is it it takes archive

147
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:49,119
Content and that it adds him links to new breaking stories

148
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:54,495
So there's a new headline about a bronze Jeffrey Epstein statue found in Albuquerque

149
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:59,871
And now that headline being in the link section of all these old articles causes them to populate in searches

150
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:00,895
For the name Epps

151
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,431
That is a response

152
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:08,831
I don't know if it is I think because the way to game search album

153
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:10,879
You're it's some sort of just like

154
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:16,767
Lawd is completely unnavigable for the most part

155
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:17,791
And I feel like this is

156
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:23,423
Probably some oversight

157
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,983
Because of universal to Alex's website

158
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:28,543
Right like it's only the case with info

159
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:34,943
Prisonplanet doesn't work the same way never attribute to cleverness towards gaming the algorithm

160
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:35,967
What could goes worth

161
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:38,271
Competency

162
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:40,831
Yeah that I could explain

163
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,623
A fair amount

164
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:47,999
In June 2008 Epstein was initially convicted by Florida Court

165
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:51,327
Create an underage girl for the purposes of prostitution

166
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:57,983
If you searching for his website specifically for articles about Epstein that were published between the beginning 2018 January

167
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,007
First 2009

168
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,287
Nothing comes up

169
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:07,199
I found this really hard to believe since I've explained that he was the first one

170
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,223
He's just making that up

171
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:15,135
I decided to look a little further and found that there are no posts that contain the word Epstein that were published on Prison Planet Alex Azar

172
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:17,951
Original mirror site prior to 2015

173
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:22,815
That seems really weird because that was the site that was much less focused on

174
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:25,631
It was more just about having the articles there

175
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:29,471
And like I said it doesn't have that same old articles of the new timeline

176
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:34,335
So I decided to consult the Wayback machine and see if I can get a better sense

177
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:37,151
Website homepage around that time

178
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,455
On July 26th

179
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,479
2006

180
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:44,831
The Smoking Gun published an article covering the probable-cause affidavit in the Epstein case

181
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:48,159
Which is the one who would eventually plead guilty to in 2008

182
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,695
To my thinking went like this

183
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:54,815
If Alex was all over this story than covering it by that

184
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:57,119
July 26th 2006

185
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:59,935
I have no idea about the inner workings of the smoking

186
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:06,335
Garner their editorial

187
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,615
Alex Sonata covered it

188
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:12,223
As well by that point

189
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:16,063
There's no snapshot of Infowars from that

190
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,599
August 10th 2006

191
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:19,391
A whole lot of the website

192
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:21,951
I would say almost the entire thing

193
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:25,535
Middle East

194
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:28,863
Conflict which makes sense given the video landscaper 2006

195
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,911
On the sidebar of the site

196
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,703
There's a big list of topics

197
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,751
Like the main topics event for

198
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:37,567
They include total surveillance Society

199
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,871
Cashless Society control grid

200
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:41,151
Embedded microchip

201
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:47,807
Rsib stolen phones Bohemian Seltzer's

202
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,855
Freemasonry and the Patriot Act

203
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:53,439
These are the themes they were in us all about back there

204
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:58,047
Because you might call conservative conspiracy topics

205
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:02,911
There's no trace of the current flavors of Alex 2006

206
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:09,567
He talks about global worship the literal death

207
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,591
Hurting children

208
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,615
SpongeBob

209
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,383
Differences

210
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,175
It's a fundamental similarities

211
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:16,479
In there but the differences are glaring

212
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,527
When was also considered

213
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:24,927
Like in terms of trying to figure out trying to sort through the pieces of like where is this reporting then if you could cover

214
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:25,951
15 years

215
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:32,095
You and I have both watched and game and The Obama Deception in their entirety

216
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,119
At no point

217
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:37,215
Documentary

218
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:38,495
But you definitely should have

219
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,799
If what Alex is pretending is the case

220
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:41,567
Was Acura

221
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:46,175
As far as I can tell Alex didn't cover Epstein it all until the fairly recent past

222
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:47,967
That's okay

223
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:50,271
I don't really think that the problem

224
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:56,927
I don't expect Alex to hit every story and particularly back in that stretch of time between like 2006-2009

225
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:59,743
You have fewer writers to cover everything that came up

226
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:04,095
It's okay for Alex's now covered Epstein until pizzagate came along

227
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:10,239
Cuz that made the connection between Hillary and a giant crab all the pedophile human traffickers

228
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:13,311
It was an essential piece of the argument

229
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:16,895
Yeah it makes sense that he would start covering all this stuff then you have to

230
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:24,063
Necessarily

231
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,855
It is a gigantic failure

232
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:29,183
Primarily because if he didn't cover the story previously

233
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:33,535
It really does just appeared opportunism about

234
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:36,095
Story he's trying to weaponize for his own game

235
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:38,911
From my perspective that's exactly what this is

236
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:42,495
Until any evidence is provided to the contrary

237
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:49,151
Impossible there is at some point Alex brought up the name Jeffrey Epstein

238
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:55,551
In the context of like reading a headlight

239
00:16:55,807 --> 00:17:00,671
He's claiming like I was all over 15 years ago

240
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:03,487
You can find plenty of content

241
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:06,047
Infowars

242
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:09,375
You websites from the times that these articles should have eggs

243
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:14,751
Conveniently broke this story

244
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,287
In 2007

245
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,823
2008/2009

246
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,919
I don't know what's going on here

247
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:28,063
Calls but they were all like the best friends or the bestest friends

248
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:34,463
Also just because this is Donnie I wanted to bring up something that I found 2-0 have nothing ever changes

249
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:41,119
2006 Alex at a special page on a website about censorship

250
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:49,311
God. He set up an email address for people to email him if quote Myspace removed your page

251
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:51,871
Because of political

252
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:58,527
Nothing ever changes

253
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,063
Alex

254
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:04,415
Alex

255
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,695
South America

256
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,743
And self mythology about

257
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:11,327
Doesn't match up with my experience

258
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:15,167
The times that I've listened to

259
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:17,471
Parts of his work that

260
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:24,127
I went back and I looked through his bibliography for endgame just to like refresh my memory of everything and

261
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:25,407
There's nothing

262
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:29,503
You know I mean obviously it's Swiss cheese

263
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:35,903
Microsoft

264
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:42,303
Later we'll have it

265
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,327
Any of this stuff

266
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:49,727
I don't know it if someone can provide any kind of salad

267
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,775
Improve Alex Wright

268
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:52,799
This looks like bulshit

269
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,335
Yeah and

270
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:57,919
I mean I don't know I guess I have to say in retrospect

271
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:58,687
It seems like

272
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:00,223
It's too obvious

273
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:00,991
Low-hanging

274
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:01,759
Fruit ripe

275
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,063
Like why would you go on about the

276
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:07,391
Child's it whenever

277
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:13,791
When right in front of your face you got a billionaire connected to the highest Echelon of power

278
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:14,559
Affidavit

279
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:19,679
Well it's you got right there

280
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:27,359
Reality is this

281
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:33,759
That wouldn't remove the needle conspiracy theories are much more easy to sell

282
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:35,295
Back then that's probably

283
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,855
Probably what he wanted to do crash commercial

284
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:45,023
So does not ever provide

285
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:48,607
President still going

286
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:50,655
The front formula more expensive that coming up

287
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,519
Y'all shouldn't a question so

288
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:58,591
Believe this little jewel is going to get

289
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:04,479
Exclusive

290
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:09,599
And what's coming next is a pedophile House of Cards

291
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:10,623
Against

292
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:18,303
The Infowars article that has the video of the show he's currently

293
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:24,703
Trump speech

294
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:25,983
The show Alex's doing

295
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:32,127
That does not end up ever giving Secrets details

296
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:33,919
Weather

297
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:36,223
You have to work really hard

298
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:42,623
I mean I guess I guess ungenerous because he does talk some s***

299
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:52,095
I guess

300
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,375
Huge

301
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:56,191
Ghislaine Maxwell

302
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:58,239
Super spy

303
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:02,591
Triple spy operative in the Epstein pedophile ring

304
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:08,735
This seems like a little bit of a dick move for me to complain about Alex's pronunciation given that I butcher a ton of words

305
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:10,783
All the time

306
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:16,416
Alex a big expert on the whole FC doesn't know how to pronounce Cillian Maxwell's name

307
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:17,952
And that strikes me as

308
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,000
I didn't know how to pronounce

309
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:22,048
For sure but I am not

310
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:25,888
Expert on this case out of

311
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:28,960
I did not sit for awhile to because you know

312
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:35,360
The French name only seen it in right exactly

313
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:36,384
Excited to chat

314
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:42,528
Oh that would be smart news been on the Epstein beat 415 Buccaneers I Galaxy

315
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:43,296
Pretends to

316
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:47,648
Alex has this this entire

317
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:48,416
This fish

318
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:54,048
Narratives all all built out there what's going on is that Epstein was

319
00:21:54,304 --> 00:22:00,448
Getting blackmail on people in order to solidify the globalists control over everything

320
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:06,848
But also he's a middle manager he's just like a Renfield as

321
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:07,616
LG

322
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:21,184
Call her about whether or not

323
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,232
Epstein's middle management and it was

324
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:36,288
How do you think Ariel from The Little Mermaid would do on the on the Cubs do you think she would hit 240 what do you think

325
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:40,896
What's the level of Ohio

326
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:44,992
Narrative about

327
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:46,528
About

328
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:50,880
I'll stop for a while

329
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:56,512
But it turns out there's a little bit more to it

330
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:57,792
Spirituality

331
00:22:58,048 --> 00:23:04,192
Don't remember ladies and gentlemen that they want to control people and they want to compromise

332
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:08,800
The only way to really do that

333
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:10,080
Because you also

334
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,104
God

335
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,128
Remove history

336
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,152
Action from you

337
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:19,296
Adding dirt on you thought just about blackmail

338
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:22,368
What I'm going to do is alright

339
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,928
I push this down the road a little bit here

340
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:28,768
Alright so I started to like

341
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:31,072
What is he talking about

342
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:33,632
And I realize that it all just comes from Joe

343
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:34,656
Like you

344
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:35,680
Oh okay

345
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:42,080
To the stuff we talked about God's protection and Butthead

346
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:46,944
Call him talking about how God allowed

347
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:53,344
To mess with Jobe in order to prove that he had faced the outside of the

348
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,136
Really uplifting

349
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:55,904
The Bible that one

350
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:02,304
Right back on it as a message

351
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:08,704
Got your point is don't question me and I'll f****** your life and kill your kids

352
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:14,336
Maybe we'll get 15 more later like I don't know how that book Works you're a good and Noble person

353
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:15,360
Phuc yea

354
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:20,992
I will purchase whims of a deity you can't understand

355
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:22,272
I will

356
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,552
Mess you up

357
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,136
Because I want to prove a point

358
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:32,256
Well there's a reason it just be some big reason

359
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:33,536
Prove a point to say

360
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:34,816
I don't know

361
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:40,448
The pettiest book of the Bible

362
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:41,216
Takes a lot

363
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:44,288
Text from that I think if there's a lot of things about you

364
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:45,056
Conception

365
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:50,176
I think he might do something bad

366
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:56,576
That removes misunderstanding point of the book

367
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:58,880
Those ideas are are pretty traceable back

368
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,952
It's kind of weird to me

369
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:02,976
Got a weird

370
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:07,584
When I said I was talk s*** this is the closest he has to like

371
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,656
Inside details about the arrest

372
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:12,192
I don't think you can prove this

373
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,264
I know some folks in New York on the sleeve attack

374
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:20,384
District

375
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:22,944
As you know we also know

376
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:24,992
Police New Jersey New York

377
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,088
And so I made some phone calls this morning as soon as this broke

378
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,112
What about

379
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,184
9 a.m. eastern

380
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:36,768
Thank you and they said absolutely has to do with

381
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:41,632
They removed a few weeks ago

382
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:48,544
It has to do with the fact that there's been a manafort

383
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,824
For almost a year

384
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:55,968
Some experts believe that

385
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,576
We're not really trying to get her

386
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:12,864
As soon as the news broke that Maxwell have been arrested and charged in the southern district that Alex would leave the firing of prosecutor

387
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,936
Story

388
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:22,336
Protecting Max

389
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:23,104
Arrest happen

390
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:27,968
Wow this is going to be a convoluted narrative dry makes stick for a number of reasons

391
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:34,112
41 Bourbons replacement Aubrey Strauss has gone on record to Maxwell's arrest was quote not at all related

392
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:34,880
To Bourbon Jacks

393
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:41,792
Probably more importantly it was Geoffrey Berman who originally filed the charges against Epstein

394
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:42,560
That can befall

395
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:48,448
It seems weird that you'll be the one to charge Epstein but then also be responsible for the non-arrest of Maxwell

396
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:53,056
Also this indictment Maxwell was arrested on WhatsApp

397
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:57,920
Involves a case being made to group of citizens who then decide on whether the case moves forward or not

398
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:04,576
Would have been able to push through an entire

399
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:07,648
And getting indictment in a two-week since Berman was Romo

400
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:10,976
Sometimes I just want

401
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:17,120
Alex can talk all this s*** but somebody right next time she just have to like starting

402
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:22,240
Explain charger with a crime

403
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:25,824
Wait you have to do all of this

404
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,872
The president just remove you

405
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:28,896
It'll be great

406
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:34,528
Alex's tacos

407
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:42,976
Which resources that Alex could you refer me back to the timestamp on my phone

408
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:56,800
How much more likely explanation is the Birdman was investigating Trump's Associates in Dusky got fired

409
00:27:57,312 --> 00:28:03,456
Has Maxwell arrested something that's unclear and it very well may be too right now

410
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:06,016
There might have been

411
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,280
There's a lot we don't know right now it's option

412
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:19,840
That's a game that doesn't leave the good place

413
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:23,424
I'm pretty sure he's just talking

414
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:27,008
And this is as close as it gets to any kind of like

415
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:31,872
The headline is supposed to be Alex has deep secret information about Maxwell arrest

416
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:34,688
That's always Suburban

417
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:35,456
Really

418
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:39,296
Just be Alex speculates on wild story

419
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:44,672
So as all this is coming down

420
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:49,792
You know all these criminals

421
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:51,840
Are going to start happening

422
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:53,376
Information

423
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:56,960
Begin to be drug out into the sunlight

424
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:06,432
And that's why you're going to see cartoonish things but

425
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:08,480
Pop culture

426
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:16,928
There's thousands of tunnels underground and hundreds of thousands of children that ever seen by

427
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:20,000
A what

428
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:30,240
Wait what

429
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:36,896
Special Forces

430
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:37,920
Call

431
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:39,456
So

432
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,480
That's confusing

433
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:46,880
Because

434
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:49,184
Almost identical

435
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:55,584
I'm saying you're going to hear Wild Things

436
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,120
Are there kids underground

437
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:59,936
Yes you are there tunnels of course

438
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:02,496
That's weird

439
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:09,152
I think that was Alex trying to shoot on Cuban and then realizing

440
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:10,688
Stop

441
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:17,344
So Alex is teasing has big news that doesn't really ever come has to do with the Maxwell

442
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,112
Situation

443
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:24,768
Ain't you just teasing me

444
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:31,424
So he keeps teasing but there's something else, too

445
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,192
It's in Peoria

446
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:33,728
Quite frankly

447
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:36,288
I want to make a few more phone calls before I

448
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:47,808
Sounds like

449
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,392
Exactly why

450
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,440
Is this is a big deal

451
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:56,768
Also I'm Not Afraid repercussions releasing this information

452
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:01,120
You didn't really had an operation for people

453
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:04,704
Exactly right

454
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,472
But

455
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:13,664
Most people be sitting there office thinking right now about

456
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:21,856
To sit here is all this keep coming in

457
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:22,624
The backstory

458
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,440
Contact

459
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:33,888
Still it's not a good feeling though

460
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:36,704
When you get such bombshell info that you know is confirm

461
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,472
Wheel

462
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:42,080
Think about how you were leasing a little bit but

463
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,248
I need your prayers Pub

464
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:56,928
2020 is a very special year to the globalist

465
00:31:57,184 --> 00:32:03,328
Run off to break their

466
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:04,096
This is like

467
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:07,168
I got to come up with something good

468
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,728
And the writers are hitting the wall

469
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:16,384
More like stalling

470
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:22,784
Just going you're almost there you're almost at the break

471
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:25,344
Alex

472
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,136
Doesn't get to

473
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:31,232
Whatever information he's pretending he has defenses

474
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:33,536
Barbie ideas

475
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:35,072
You know you Jordan

476
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,096
You're out there

477
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:40,448
You post something about Infowars right people call you crazy

478
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:43,264
Response

479
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:48,384
About the New World Order

480
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:56,576
About Epstein

481
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:58,880
14 years 15 years before

482
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:02,976
Years before he got busted

483
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:05,024
Protect traffic the first time

484
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:09,120
Was

485
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:10,144
Documents

486
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:14,752
Triple agent of us British

487
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:16,032
Intelligent

488
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:17,312
And he was running

489
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:18,592
The Summit

490
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:21,664
With Bill Gates and other top scientist

491
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,712
I knew what Bill Gates was up to

492
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:26,272
The information

493
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:32,928
Ciclop is fun because it gives you more specifics about Alex

494
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,768
Who's covering Epstein

495
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:38,560
Probably like what

496
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:40,352
2005 or before

497
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:42,912
Further Alex has a certain that he knew about Epstein

498
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:45,728
I'm some big documents in running Summit

499
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:46,496
Who's that

500
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:52,384
Because I've listened to countless hours of Alex's show I know that what he's talking about is the group that Bill Gates was in

501
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,408
Call the good cop

502
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:59,296
The philanthropic Collective that included people like Bill Gates Warren Buffett David Rockefeller

503
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:05,696
Sure the group in 2009 and claimed the roster also included Oprah Ted Turner and George Soros

504
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:12,608
The meeting was apparently prompted by the economic crisis and public discussion about

505
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:14,912
Kind of meeting of billionaires

506
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:19,520
Yeah that has a real

507
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:26,176
Circle does not mention Epstein it all

508
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:27,712
Epstein was the one behind those

509
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:29,504
Thanks for that meeting of those people

510
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:31,808
There's no proof of this other than Alex's rant

511
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:34,368
The only evidence I can find offer Dunkin

512
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:40,768
Conspiracy sites about this is that Epstein was on the Board of Trustees of the Rockefeller University

513
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:41,536
Took place

514
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:48,192
That's a fun piece of information for someone to play around

515
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:49,472
One term for resigning

516
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:54,080
The time he was around Rockville University doesn't match up with the time when this meeting took place

517
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:58,944
Because there's a surface-level appearance of connection Alex's decided to report on this

518
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,736
As concrete and reel

519
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:07,136
This club did not exist before 2009

520
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:10,976
There's no real indication that it's an actual Club as much as it is a super

521
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:13,280
Group of super wealthy

522
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:14,816
We're trying to combine their efforts to

523
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:17,376
Global economic crisis

524
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:18,144
They're better at

525
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:23,264
Are all in the same building

526
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,288
Your call on that

527
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:28,640
Horrifying recruiting video

528
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:34,016
Water for these billionaires or safety idea that meeting like that is great

529
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:38,368
As far as

530
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:44,000
And if you consult Alex's old reporting never brings up Epstein

531
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:50,400
This is just an element is added to the story later mostly because of how important the narrative is to rationalize and supporting Trump

532
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:52,960
Though he's a horrible person doing a horrible job

533
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:59,360
And then there are the connections between Bill Gates and universities didn't come out because of

534
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:04,224
Competent reporters into older things

535
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:11,136
You know there's a whip there's a way you can you can be a shitbag

536
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:13,952
And you can just claim that you knew all of this the whole time

537
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:15,488
Or you can build

538
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,048
You know you can build on the good reporting

539
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:21,632
Alex is not building on the good reporting and adding anything into

540
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:22,656
Christie's building

541
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:31,104
Further things

542
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:39,296
Been wondering lately

543
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:46,208
Surprise

544
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:48,000
Surprising is what Alex

545
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:49,280
Yeah it believes

546
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:52,096
The cortical trans agenda is about

547
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:54,400
Rawlings

548
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,032
Moment

549
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:03,104
30 years ago

550
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:07,200
Instead the trans movement

551
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:10,272
Is about abusing women and children

552
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:13,600
Not abusing people

553
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:15,392
The highest rates of

554
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:16,928
Suicide drug abuse

555
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:17,952
Not because

556
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:22,304
But because of the culture

557
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,328
And the system

558
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:24,608
What it does

559
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:37,664
Cyborg

560
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:39,200
Children

561
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:40,992
We want to be a robot

562
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,064
I'm a trans robot

563
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,344
What it's about

564
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:51,744
That's not what's coming

565
00:37:54,560 --> 00:38:00,192
Trans issues and transhumanism

566
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:06,848
Yeah

567
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:11,712
Are you give them that mechanical arm until they are 18

568
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:14,016
I don't know man

569
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:22,976
Laser cannon for an arm

570
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:31,424
Dude I don't know

571
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,752
Shaking my head but then I would have probably just ignored it

572
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:43,712
Apparently we learn

573
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:45,504
What is Dad

574
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:50,368
Let me just really I just need to

575
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:51,136
Alright

576
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:52,416
JK Rowling

577
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:54,720
Ghost

578
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:58,304
Alex takes that as an opportunity to explain what's wrong with cyborg

579
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:04,448
Okay now I'm in red

580
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:06,240
But I don't know if they're cyborgs

581
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:12,896
I don't know that apparently were involved.

582
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:15,200
Related projects

583
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:16,480
I remember

584
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:18,272
17 years ago

585
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,392
Remember my family was in a

586
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:25,952
Restricted

587
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:27,488
Reaping in Texas

588
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:40,032
Cuz it was commissioned officers with all the top

589
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,360
Come on man

590
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:49,504
You're stalling

591
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:51,808
Makeup something good

592
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:54,624
As you know somebody special forces

593
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:02,304
Rolled out publicly

594
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:09,472
While they were right on time

595
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:11,264
They figured it out he got in trouble

596
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:17,920
12 year old Telugu story

597
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:20,992
The twelve-year-old lying about why they were late to school

598
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,392
3D IHSS for

599
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:30,720
Ground-based

600
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:32,256
We need robot teeth

601
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:36,864
What's Mikey

602
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,984
Basically all the people whose background checked out

603
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:50,688
What the f*** are you talking about

604
00:40:55,808 --> 00:41:01,952
There's so much wrong with that

605
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:07,072
First most glaring problem

606
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:13,472
17 years ago

607
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:19,872
2020 Alex's dumping like we got 10 years left

608
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:25,248
Deadline

609
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:31,392
This family member is

610
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:32,160
Alex

611
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:38,560
Realized

612
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:39,840
Not that much trouble

613
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:49,824
Everybody

614
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:53,151
Seems like that would be a court-martial little bit

615
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:55,455
Not a slap on the wrist

616
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:57,759
Leaving all the sort of

617
00:41:58,271 --> 00:42:04,415
Might decide to is the idea of Alex's Dad here

618
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:07,743
There are these people

619
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:12,607
That have underground bunkers I swear they are creating cyborg

620
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,399
Right now

621
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:17,471
Everything we know about Alex

622
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:20,543
Diesel Depot

623
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:22,335
Because that's what the globalist

624
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:23,103
Do

625
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:27,967
They tried to recruit Alex's dad and it's good that Alex's dad didn't go along with that

626
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:34,367
While at the same time the only reason they would recruit Alex's dad is because he was a true patriot it's something that

627
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:38,975
The globalist themselves are apparently again you have latched onto your problem

628
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:44,607
I don't know why the globalist would

629
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:51,007
Specifically only hire antique octopus

630
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:52,287
Whiteboard project

631
00:42:55,615 --> 00:43:01,759
It's just some it up exactly

632
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:10,463
Now I've no I know you think that that doesn't make sense based on the table

633
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:16,863
Make sense because they're trying to seduce the antique

634
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,655
Stanton sound inconsistent

635
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:25,823
So Alex guitar store about the transition smoothly into animal-human hybrids

636
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:30,943
Okay caller

637
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:32,991
Check this out

638
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:33,759
Stop yourself

639
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:38,879
I've named it a secret lab by the way

640
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:50,655
Actually show you

641
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:51,679
Pygmy Pig

642
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:18,815
I needed this I did miss it it's this weird

643
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:20,607
Okay so

644
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:21,631
Look

645
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:22,911
I understand

646
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:29,055
Maxwell News in Suffern Alex

647
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:30,591
Yeah I mean

648
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:37,759
What I hear there is Alex forgetting that he's supposed to be the one who

649
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:39,295
Lab

650
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:45,695
The fish with human eyes

651
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:48,767
His own store that was the fish that he saw he's talking about

652
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:54,143
The pigs he didn't see the pic pic book the pygmy pig people I would argue that if Alex wants to make this

653
00:44:54,399 --> 00:45:00,543
Point his story about the fish people is more compelling than the second dance

654
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:06,943
I saw the fish people eat fish people and forgotten about it

655
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:13,343
Are you take out your memory

656
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:19,487
So

657
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:25,887
This leads to Alex's discussion and this is why I really connected

658
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:26,911
Two eps

659
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:28,191
Stop is because

660
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:30,239
Apparently Epstein's also Trek

661
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:32,287
He's created nahmias

662
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:33,823
There was that

663
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:40,223
Talk of how he wanted to see the human race with his DNA

664
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:42,271
Listen to he's creating an army of clones

665
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:48,671
I love those regular insane billionaire s*** yeah

666
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:55,071
To be in the realm of I want to be the next to Genghis Khan

667
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:59,167
No I'm open to revising that position if someone can have it in

668
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:04,031
As Alex is suggesting an army of clones

669
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:06,847
I don't think that I like taking Execute order order

670
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:08,895
I don't know but now it doesn't make

671
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:10,175
The case very well

672
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:16,063
He's talking about one of the Epstein victim

673
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:21,439
Was a very special Uno's who's

674
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:23,487
Bill Gates

675
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:29,631
Close route

676
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:33,215
If you don't just trade a cloning

677
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:35,263
Freezer it goes bad

678
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:37,567
You got it

679
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:49,599
So he was running a Toro Ranch

680
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:51,391
With hundreds of women

681
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:53,951
Projects

682
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:59,071
What are they doing in there

683
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:00,351
The word is

684
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:01,887
Experiments

685
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:02,911
Cloning

686
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:03,679
You name it

687
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:10,079
That's why you see the headline of the British government wants to pay for artificial wombs be put in

688
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:11,871
Men

689
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:13,407
They can be women

690
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:26,207
And now you got all these humanoids that are already walking around

691
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:30,815
They're not going to have right

692
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:35,423
Call Ben program genetically

693
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:37,983
Operate the weather

694
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:40,031
Alright

695
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:44,639
Alright so a problem.

696
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:47,711
I honestly doubt though

697
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:54,367
I don't know and I don't think listening to this episode and its entirety give you any time

698
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:55,903
Close

699
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:59,743
Clothes right there is a 1000 different things

700
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:02,303
Steve's to be talkin about

701
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:06,655
I got no handle

702
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:07,935
Trying to say

703
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:09,983
I would argue that if someone

704
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:11,775
Was a clone of Bill Gates

705
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:13,567
Sure they were human

706
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:15,615
Yeah yeah

707
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:20,223
People who are like

708
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:23,039
If that's Alex's hard-and-fast rule right it has to be

709
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:25,855
Artificial insemination

710
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:28,415
I don't know

711
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:30,975
I suppose that's when

712
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:33,535
I am

713
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:35,583
This is confusing

714
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:38,655
And a lot of this stuff I was listening to

715
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:40,191
I don't even care

716
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:45,311
Alright man keep on going

717
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:48,127
Listen

718
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:49,663
I'm just going to

719
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:52,735
Play clips of you rambling about cyborg

720
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:54,271
Log

721
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:57,343
To get through all of reality right now Dan

722
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:00,415
A good old Alex Jones screaming about chimeras

723
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:06,815
Yeah yeah

724
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:08,607
Is this episode is very restorative

725
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:12,703
And it will be even more so once we get to the evening

726
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:14,239
So

727
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:18,847
Just comes down to Good and Evil you know there's one side good

728
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:22,687
What's makes a reference that makes me think

729
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:23,711
He doesn't know which side

730
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:24,991
Maybe.

731
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:29,855
Bikes

732
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:32,927
Things like

733
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:35,487
Order 66

734
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:38,815
And they're taking over

735
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:41,375
Evil

736
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:44,703
You don't have political Solutions today

737
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:48,287
Eat first of all things that order 66

738
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:49,311
Jeezy but he's

739
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:54,175
He's the one who uses it all

740
00:49:55,199 --> 00:50:01,343
Encouraging plan from science fiction

741
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:03,647
Explicitly

742
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:06,463
I don't like the bad guys

743
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:09,279
But you're not going to defeat the Jedi any other way

744
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:15,679
And the Jedi did you see them they're trying to overthrow the Republic

745
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:25,407
Alex Caruso

746
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:27,455
So Alex

747
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:30,783
Solution

748
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:34,623
I don't like the Vogons but you got to build that by folks

749
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:37,183
Just got to build it

750
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:37,951
Kill

751
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:39,743
Now since they're going hot

752
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:42,047
The Right Move by

753
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:45,887
Individuals in the establishment who aren't perfect

754
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:48,191
And understand

755
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:49,471
YouTube

756
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:51,519
Take these people out

757
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:52,287
Quickly

758
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:04,831
Week when you can play games on

759
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:11,999
Let music came in

760
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:24,287
Demonstrate

761
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:31,711
There's no doubt about it

762
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:35,039
Andy wants people to be afraid of just about everything

763
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:36,319
There's a long-standing

764
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:42,719
Certain narrative analysis from time to time

765
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:46,047
It's never been a varsity narrative and it's still not

766
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:49,119
And that is with Soros and his people are putting in

767
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:53,471
Attorneys in defense attorneys and prosecutors

768
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:58,079
In small places like all around the country in order to G

769
00:51:58,335 --> 00:52:00,127
The Patriots or whatever

770
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:02,943
Preoccupied with

771
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:03,967
Because of I think

772
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:07,295
Down-ballot Sunday

00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:08,319
Some Focus

774
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:11,391
Organizations

775
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:14,463
On local elections

776
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:17,023
Resents that a little bit

777
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:18,047
You talked about

778
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:19,071
That little baby

779
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:21,631
Little girls

780
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:28,799
District attorney

781
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:35,967
Put it on by George Soros and

782
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:41,599
Communist

783
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:46,719
Racial cover whatever come kill you at your house and they nobility

784
00:52:57,727 --> 00:52:59,263
Cuz they're using them

785
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:02,591
You cannot make up the criminal nature of this

786
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:04,383
The full criminal attack

787
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:05,919
The Holdrege Criminal

788
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:09,759
Are y'all better run by pedophiles and devil worshipers what are you expecting

789
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:11,295
They're gone

790
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:12,319
They're gone

791
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:14,111
You can't believe anything they say

792
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:23,071
Zombie lazy asses believe they're about to rule a liberal knows it's all

793
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:31,519
Super sale is in the heart of it right now

You're insane

Yeah you are

798
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:52,255
Mia's

799
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:53,023
That's a little star

800
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:54,047
We just driving

801
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:59,423
Zombie asses lazy asses for the masses

802
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:05,311
Soros put in these prosecutors and attorneys

803
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:08,639
In order for black communist

804
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:10,687
To come to your house and kill you

805
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:12,735
And then they don't charge it as a murder

806
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:18,879
Pretty weird communist under racial cover

807
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:21,183
Right that's what that's what he say

808
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:22,463
So that means that there are

809
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:26,047
Okay

810
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:28,095
They go undercover by being black

811
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:29,375
The safest

812
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:31,423
You can be

813
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:34,751
Because a political front

814
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:36,799
It's all very dumb

815
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:39,359
So I most of this episode I got

816
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:43,199
It's mostly like a rambling

817
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:44,735
Meandering evangelism

818
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:46,015
It is

819
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:48,063
Largely about like

820
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:50,623
You got it you got to go with God man

821
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:53,951
And I'm going to play this next clip that isn't really like

822
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:57,791
It's not fully substantiv there's not a lot to discuss about it but

823
00:54:58,047 --> 00:55:00,351
It was what I really felt captured the feeling

824
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:03,935
But I would describe as meaninglessness of this episode

825
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:06,495
Before you can fly you got to learn how to

826
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:07,263
Crawl

827
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:08,287
I walked

828
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:13,919
Cuz the wings don't go out to Eureka

829
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:20,831
Good save

830
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:31,583
The planets

831
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:33,375
Have you reached out

832
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:35,423
Metaphysically God and knock on the door

833
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:43,871
I can get you to abuse a child

834
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:44,895
Worship Satan

835
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:51,551
Choose the devil

836
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:53,087
Then that's the ultimate sin

837
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:57,439
Moved or turned over to the

838
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:59,999
And then you become ghislaine Maxwell

839
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:00,767
Bill Clinton

840
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:07,423
Sniveling evil

841
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:09,471
Personal baubles

842
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:13,311
Troll

843
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:16,639
Thrown into a junk pile like a broken toy

844
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:19,199
Really want to be a pawn

845
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:23,039
Lose your Birthright to the universe

846
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:26,623
K

847
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:31,999
So purely selfish

848
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:33,791
John finally there

849
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:41,471
Fun

850
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:44,287
Fathomable conscience

851
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:47,103
So you just want to reward

852
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:50,943
We got Crawl Through the muck first

853
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:53,503
Before you fake

854
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:56,831
This is all just like

855
00:56:57,343 --> 00:56:59,135
This show is nothing

856
00:56:59,391 --> 00:57:04,511
Giving a speech at a bully pulpit

857
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:08,607
It is so little in Turkey

858
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:11,167
Analysis news

859
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:14,751
Hard-hitting anything it's just a guy ranting about the devil

860
00:57:15,007 --> 00:57:19,615
It sounds a little bit like a writer's room for people who are trying to make inspirational slogan

861
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:26,783
Come out till 4

862
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:29,087
Caveat

863
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:32,671
Is another selling of people who might jump off a cliff

864
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:35,231
Sign but with a bunch of footnotes on her

865
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:41,887
So Alex at this point goes to calls because I think he just realize it's like

866
00:57:42,143 --> 00:57:44,191
Whatever

867
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:49,823
So you go through this first caller who suggests that Elaine Maxwell is going to get covid

868
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:51,615
In prison when Alex says

869
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:53,151
Good call

870
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:56,991
Something's going to happen to her

871
00:57:57,503 --> 00:57:59,551
Going to go out just like that for you

872
00:58:01,343 --> 00:58:03,135
But don't worry

873
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:09,791
I'm going to happen to be put on the ventilator

874
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:11,839
And then she's going to slip away

875
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:22,335
Is on its way and everybody's got to get locked back in and she's going to

876
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:23,615
Call

877
00:58:24,383 --> 00:58:25,919
Imprisoned or whatever and she's going to

878
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:26,943
I'm down with it

879
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:28,223
That'll be the end of her

880
00:58:31,807 --> 00:58:34,879
You're given the global Austin idea of what to do

881
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:47,679
The global it's just as if this wasn't already on Meme the second she got arrested

882
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:54,079
Call Iran

883
00:58:54,335 --> 00:58:55,103
Product but

884
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:59,199
He has one particular question about a product it's no longer for sale

885
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:01,247
Like the plug in and say that you're proud

886
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:03,551
Curious

887
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:05,087
If your toothpaste

888
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:06,111
This is going to be coming back

889
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:10,975
Lawsuit

890
00:59:11,743 --> 00:59:13,535
The Attorney General of New York

891
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:16,863
What he says

892
00:59:23,007 --> 00:59:24,543
We never said that

893
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:32,991
Committing the crime in my name

894
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:34,783
Only because

895
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:36,831
She's engaged in criminal activity

896
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:37,599
Sure

897
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:41,695
And says that I'm saying

898
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:46,559
Letitia James

899
00:59:48,095 --> 00:59:49,375
I got a false alarm before I do it but

900
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:59,103
At the end of the day people love the toothpaste was the best-selling item

901
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:00,639
But

902
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:02,943
You know

903
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:19,071
I certainly hope she doesn't sue you for that

904
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:20,095
Alright

905
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:27,519
Here's where we get into the problem with doubling down imagine Dental

906
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:31,103
No

907
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:33,151
I don't know about litigious people right

908
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:37,503
I would suggest that if I were

909
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:41,855
Old murderer

910
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:44,159
Yes

911
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:46,463
I think so

912
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:53,119
Not that I know of

913
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:57,983
In the context of how much he hates her because she said

914
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:05,663
Lashing out at somebody because

915
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:08,479
Then you're doing something wrong

916
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:12,319
Let me build a real quick case for

917
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:13,343
Alright

918
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:14,111
This guy

919
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:20,511
Who hasn't known history of threatening people alright on the show where he threatens fit

920
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:21,535
Just people to kill

921
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:22,815
All of his enemies

922
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:26,399
On his show said that this person is a murderer

923
01:01:28,447 --> 01:01:30,239
Qualifying her for the

924
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:32,799
I'm pretty sure this wasn't an opening time

925
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:39,199
Miss James if you're listening to take a take action on that really short clip

926
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:45,599
At all

927
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:48,671
I'm guessing his lawyers

928
01:01:48,927 --> 01:01:55,071
We were like you cannot stop yourself from selling this toothpaste no trouble

929
01:01:55,327 --> 01:01:57,887
Turn off the store

930
01:01:58,143 --> 01:02:01,215
Oh yeah I'll start selling this

931
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:04,287
You are I got to do

932
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:08,895
Silence says a guy named Bishop Larry gaiters Gators

933
01:02:09,151 --> 01:02:09,663
Guzman

934
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:10,943
And

935
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:12,735
I'm not going to talk too much about the

936
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:14,015
This guy because I

937
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:22,207
Couple things that are worth pointing out

938
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:22,975
Here's the first

939
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:24,255
Now I'm 23

940
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:32,447
Listen I have no sympathy

941
01:02:33,471 --> 01:02:35,263
I am a contract Killer

942
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:38,335
Jesus Christ

943
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:39,615
Is to cut

944
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:49,343
That is the military armor blacklivesmatter

945
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:52,159
So I'm like

946
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:53,439
Having flashbacks

947
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:59,839
Here we are in the lead up to an election and Alex's talking to someone named Larry about the women he does

948
01:03:00,095 --> 01:03:03,167
Doesn't like being witches it's not hard to find

949
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:09,567
You throw a stone at a Larry and you're going to find somebody who hates which reality is on rerun

950
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:10,335
Wow

951
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:12,639
Writers are getting very creative

952
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:13,407
Witches

953
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:18,527
So this guy's whole big deal is that there is like

954
01:03:18,783 --> 01:03:24,927
Colt from Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

955
01:03:25,183 --> 01:03:28,767
And there's some sort of cult involved

956
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:30,047
It's it's

957
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:34,143
Nonsensical

958
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:36,191
Like things are connected to each other

959
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:39,007
You're so tangential and all over the place

960
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:40,799
About this guy

961
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:44,895
Pattern to make slime

962
01:03:45,151 --> 01:03:46,687
Ormoc this because

963
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:51,551
I see it as more sign of unwellness

964
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:54,111
I figured this out who this guy is

965
01:03:54,623 --> 01:03:57,183
He is a bishop

966
01:03:57,439 --> 01:03:59,999
Some sort I don't know a lot of backstory

967
01:04:00,255 --> 01:04:03,583
But he's somebody who's been a guest on Sam tripoli's podcast

968
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:09,983
Polo hat

969
01:04:13,055 --> 01:04:19,199
He's one of the only people who will have Alex still on his podcast

970
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:22,783
How this connection got made

971
01:04:25,855 --> 01:04:26,623
Atrocious

972
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:28,159
Bonkers

973
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:30,463
There's a couple of times when

974
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:31,487
He talks about word

975
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:34,047
And I think these are fun

976
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:36,863
I don't want to sit down and talk about like

977
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:43,263
Okay the way his brain is jumping from a 2L to be all over the

978
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:46,079
If you want to talk about

979
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:48,127
Pablo fun with that

980
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:53,759
Can you look at the term negro negro come from

981
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:57,599
Ero

982
01:04:58,111 --> 01:04:59,135
Which means

983
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:02,719
Having sex with a dead body

984
01:05:03,743 --> 01:05:05,023
This is where we get the term

985
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:09,119
Elio or necrophiliac

986
01:05:09,631 --> 01:05:12,959
That's not even close to true now I'm going to have to say that this is

987
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:14,239
I mean

988
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:15,007
Just impact

989
01:05:17,567 --> 01:05:21,919
From negro black in Spanish and Portuguese

990
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:23,967
It's also

991
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:27,807
Close related languages

992
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:32,927
Give me in Romanian narrow in Italian and nigre in Catalan

993
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:35,999
The reason for this is that these are all romance languages

994
01:05:36,255 --> 01:05:40,607
Some are all terms that are derived from the Latin word for black

995
01:05:40,863 --> 01:05:43,935
Necro

996
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:45,727
No letters cnh

997
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:49,823
Greek it's spelled with a k or Capa in its non transliterated form

998
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:53,919
Also nekros means dead body not to have sex with a dead body

999
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:56,991
The common word for black in Greek was mellow

1000
01:05:57,247 --> 01:05:58,527
And there're

1001
01:05:58,783 --> 01:06:01,343
Different routed words from two different languages

1002
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:02,111
Trees

1003
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:04,671
This dude is legitimately just making s*** up

1004
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:06,719
And asserting this falsehood with

1005
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:08,767
Amazing about confidence

1006
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:14,911
Some letters and words in there the same way

1007
01:06:15,167 --> 01:06:15,679
Yeah

1008
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:19,775
Does bananas this happens a lot

1009
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:24,383
To turn media comes from the Hebrew term medium

1010
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:27,455
Cracked

1011
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:28,479
CNN

1012
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:31,807
Goddamn

1013
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:32,831
NBC

1014
01:06:33,087 --> 01:06:38,463
CNBC MSNBC they're all witches and warlocks

1015
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:43,071
This should come as no surprise but the media does not come from the Hebrew word for witches

1016
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:49,983
The Hebrew word for witches Is Mikasa has nothing to do with the root for the word We Now understand it

1017
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:50,751
Is Media

1018
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:53,055
That comes from the Latin root medius

1019
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:59,711
The confusion here and what day does is just making stuff up about is that media comes from the Latin root

1020
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:03,551
The same word as medium which English is a spiritualist

1021
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:05,343
Or one who speaks of shows

1022
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:11,999
1853 at least an

1023
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:12,767
The word

1024
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:19,679
Received and you're just not getting in on the fun of it like look look what I can see is it just you

1025
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:26,079
Notebook the word notebook comes from notes that if you get rid of it

1026
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:31,967
Not that can be something that you tie up and well that's also a rate of speed for traveling on your boat

1027
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:38,367
Two different meanings of words have is the devil thank you very much

1028
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:44,767
Jesus I understand the association games can have

1029
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:47,327
Right

1030
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:51,423
This is different than that though this is somebody who's trying

1031
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:52,447
To use

1032
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:53,215
False

1033
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:54,751
Cognates

1034
01:07:55,007 --> 01:07:57,567
Root word tracing

1035
01:07:57,823 --> 01:08:00,383
In order to depict the reality that doesn't actually exist

1036
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:02,687
And that to me is drunk

1037
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:05,247
In order to communicate words have to have an agreed-upon

1038
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:12,159
Right and if you just change the meaning of words then you are not I can't communicate well

1039
01:08:12,415 --> 01:08:14,207
Play lack of any kind of

1040
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:20,607
Work because if you do comes from necro in Greek

1041
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:21,887
Into it at all

1042
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:28,031
You already know the answer cuz there's a couple letters difference

1043
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:31,871
Anyways

1044
01:08:32,127 --> 01:08:33,151
Is the last Clipper going to look

1045
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:35,199
Do of this dude

1046
01:08:35,455 --> 01:08:37,503
And I only really keep this in because it's

1047
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:41,599
To hear man is just like

1048
01:08:42,879 --> 01:08:46,463
Good sandwich he doesn't actually there's no obvious eating

1049
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:47,487
He's probably eating it

1050
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:51,327
Witnessing

1051
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:52,607
Between

1052
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:56,959
The first constitution

1053
01:08:59,263 --> 01:09:01,055
1776

1054
01:09:01,567 --> 01:09:03,103
1017

1055
01:09:03,871 --> 01:09:07,455
Versus the global down cement lucitor in deep state

1056
01:09:07,967 --> 01:09:10,271
Constitution

1057
01:09:10,527 --> 01:09:16,671
1871

1058
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:18,975
Pius the 9th

1059
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:29,471
In eastern central and Western Europe

1060
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:39,199
When you actually have it

1061
01:09:40,991 --> 01:09:41,759
It's like you just can't

1062
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:43,807
When you see how real it is

1063
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:46,111
Is it people

1064
01:09:47,135 --> 01:09:48,159
Playing along with it

1065
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:50,719
The second Constitution thing is just that Sovereign citizen

1066
01:09:50,975 --> 01:09:55,071
Some s*** we talked about the bed like the establishment of d.c. Washington DC

1067
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:57,119
Yeah I mean

1068
01:09:57,631 --> 01:10:00,447
This is this is ridiculous I feel like Alex

1069
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:06,079
If you were a sincere actor has a responsibility to listen to this guy

1070
01:10:06,591 --> 01:10:11,711
False in ridiculous explanations for Words be like I'm not talking to somebody

1071
01:10:11,967 --> 01:10:16,831
Be promoting it right for just because he hates black lives matter and Tifa

1072
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:17,599
Great

1073
01:10:17,855 --> 01:10:23,999
I'm glad you agree with me on anything to get a black person on my show who

1074
01:10:24,255 --> 01:10:25,023
Who doesn't like like Liza

1075
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:28,095
Will do anything I will make any sacrifice

1076
01:10:28,351 --> 01:10:32,191
It's rough to me that he is unable or unwilling

1077
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:32,959
2

1078
01:10:33,471 --> 01:10:35,007
Exercise any kind of

1079
01:10:35,263 --> 01:10:40,383
Control mechanism over like pressing something

1080
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:41,407
Grounded

1081
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:42,943
But whatever

1082
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:47,039
It has nothing to do with support or just support of things

1083
01:10:47,295 --> 01:10:50,111
Did I smart

1084
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:51,903
Icanvas

1085
01:10:53,183 --> 01:10:54,719
The show gets to an end

1086
01:10:55,743 --> 01:10:56,511
And

1087
01:10:57,279 --> 01:10:58,047
IPhone

1088
01:10:58,559 --> 01:11:04,703
He got it no he didn't he explained all the guylaine Maxwell stuff I've been listening to this

1089
01:11:04,959 --> 01:11:06,239
So far I feel completely

1090
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:09,311
A bunch of other stuff

1091
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:17,503
I can't be traumatic experience listening to this episode

1092
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:18,527
He just screams

1093
01:11:18,783 --> 01:11:22,623
About horrifying subject matter that I don't want to listen to him talk about

1094
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:25,183
That was

1095
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:25,951
Weird

1096
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:32,351
Yeah a lot of cyborg

1097
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:37,727
Let me talk to this

1098
01:11:37,983 --> 01:11:39,775
Linguist

1099
01:11:40,543 --> 01:11:45,151
Episode

1100
01:11:45,919 --> 01:11:49,503
That can't be it and I can't wait to see what he does on Friday

1101
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:53,087
Turned on Friday's episode

1102
01:11:55,135 --> 01:11:56,927
It's a show from the end of June

1103
01:11:57,439 --> 01:12:01,279
I'm like wait a second

1104
01:12:01,535 --> 01:12:02,047
Stay

So I guess you just was like alright I'll just not come in on Friday or whatever all coming on Thursday

1106
01:12:08,703 --> 01:12:09,215
F*** is going on

1107
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:12,543
I have gone to

1108
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:15,359
Because all this episode on July 2nd

1109
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:17,919
There was something that appeared to be cut out

1110
01:12:18,175 --> 01:12:19,199
Did Alex it said

1111
01:12:19,455 --> 01:12:20,735
I thought it was suspicious

1112
01:12:20,991 --> 01:12:23,039
So I went and I found the original version of it

1113
01:12:23,295 --> 01:12:25,599
It's one of those callers said s*** and they had to believe it

1114
01:12:25,855 --> 01:12:27,647
There wasn't anything to Spaceman

1115
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:34,303
You could cut out the part where you call the district attorney

1116
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:39,167
Post Exchange

1117
01:12:39,423 --> 01:12:45,055
I thought they were two special reports that were posted

1118
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:49,407
The first was a Fourth of July there's a new Civil War

1119
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:55,807
And it was worthless video where Alex was

1120
01:12:57,343 --> 01:12:57,855
Anyway

1121
01:12:58,111 --> 01:12:58,879
Not a board

1122
01:12:59,135 --> 01:12:59,647
However

1123
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:01,439
There was a two-hour special

1124
01:13:01,951 --> 01:13:03,487
From the night

1125
01:13:03,743 --> 01:13:04,767
Of July 2nd

1126
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:06,815
So he did his show

1127
01:13:07,071 --> 01:13:10,655
From 11 to 3/4 hour

1128
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:12,447
Then he did whatever he does

1129
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:13,983
Write 7

1130
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:15,263
Back on air

1131
01:13:15,519 --> 01:13:18,335
I thought like yeah that makes sense

1132
01:13:18,847 --> 01:13:21,407
He didn't do his job

1133
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:26,783
Conair for 2 hours

1134
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:28,575
Butter have

1135
01:13:28,831 --> 01:13:29,855
Dick

1136
01:13:30,111 --> 01:13:30,623
Okay

1137
01:13:32,927 --> 01:13:35,743
As good as it's Friday episode

1138
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:36,511
So let's check

1139
01:13:36,767 --> 01:13:38,815
I see what happened I turned it on

1140
01:13:39,071 --> 01:13:40,095
Immediately

1141
01:13:40,351 --> 01:13:41,119
I was

1142
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:41,887
Worried

1143
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:43,423
You know whatever.

1144
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:45,983
Ears

1145
01:13:48,287 --> 01:13:49,311
Because the enemy

1146
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:50,847
Attacking

1147
01:13:52,383 --> 01:13:53,663
What Academy, San

1148
01:13:54,175 --> 01:13:54,687
Flood

1149
01:13:57,503 --> 01:13:58,527
Raise up a standard against him

1150
01:13:59,295 --> 01:14:00,063
Asparagus

1151
01:14:00,575 --> 01:14:01,087
What's wrong

1152
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:09,279
Daughter

1153
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:11,839
Bright at night

1154
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:14,399
So I sold

1155
01:14:17,983 --> 01:14:19,519
Yeah

1156
01:14:22,335 --> 01:14:27,967
Charlie's great time to be alive right now what the f*** is going on

1157
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:30,015
I'm so scared

1158
01:14:31,295 --> 01:14:34,367
Yep that's right goodnight it's or Usher

1159
01:14:35,647 --> 01:14:38,207
Holy Spirit

1160
01:14:39,231 --> 01:14:44,863
You know what it's been a long time since I've thought about a workplace where you just

1161
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:47,167
Find with your boss coming in drunk and doing a show

1162
01:14:47,423 --> 01:14:50,751
I don't know how drunk he is he definitely seems drunk

1163
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:54,079
I will say that for sure

1164
01:14:55,359 --> 01:14:57,663
So here's the things that I want to bring in sharp closer

1165
01:14:57,919 --> 01:14:58,943
It's not 3 in the

1166
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:02,783
No he chose to do this.

1167
01:15:04,063 --> 01:15:08,159
That's 30 seconds into the show

1168
01:15:09,183 --> 01:15:14,303
Heather wavering in his voice sounds like he's going to cry that's not nothing

1169
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:16,607
No

1170
01:15:16,863 --> 01:15:18,911
I just heard that

1171
01:15:19,423 --> 01:15:22,751
Are you sure this isn't just another cut of the song

1172
01:15:23,263 --> 01:15:25,567
No

1173
01:15:26,591 --> 01:15:28,383
So

1174
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:34,783
So much of this is your scattershot nonsense

1175
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:37,855
Job so I came into this so much

1176
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:40,671
Instead he's just talking about souls and s*** like

1177
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:42,463
This makes no sense

1178
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:44,767
You can still watch the new world order your children

1179
01:15:45,023 --> 01:15:45,535
Dead

1180
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:48,351
They might live another year there 10 years

1181
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:49,375
Dark Souls

1182
01:15:51,423 --> 01:15:52,447
There is no making a

1183
01:15:52,703 --> 01:15:53,215
Deal with

1184
01:15:53,727 --> 01:15:55,519
So the reason I wanted to cut that clip is because

1185
01:15:55,775 --> 01:16:00,127
It seems like it and Alex's cosmology if you do something bad

1186
01:16:00,383 --> 01:16:02,175
Your kids Souls will be affected

1187
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:05,503
I don't like

1188
01:16:05,759 --> 01:16:07,295
This is a great religion

1189
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:09,087
Filled with a god that is

1190
01:16:09,343 --> 01:16:09,855
Awesome

1191
01:16:10,111 --> 01:16:16,255
Is that kind of against the individualism that Alex thinks America is based on the idea that you aren't

1192
01:16:16,511 --> 01:16:22,655
Like whatever your you're past your ancestors

1193
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:25,471
Way to control people's behaviors is by

1194
01:16:25,727 --> 01:16:28,543
Constantly and eternally threatening their kids Souls

1195
01:16:29,311 --> 01:16:29,823
I mean

1196
01:16:30,079 --> 01:16:31,359
I just think that's weird

1197
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:32,127
Anyway

1198
01:16:32,383 --> 01:16:35,455
He does get to talkin about Dune Maxwell good for him

1199
01:16:35,711 --> 01:16:36,223
I guess

1200
01:16:36,735 --> 01:16:37,759
Jeffrey Epstein

1201
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:38,783
Triple agent

1202
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:41,599
Am I sick

1203
01:16:41,855 --> 01:16:43,135
Mossad CIA

1204
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:46,207
Sex operative

1205
01:16:48,255 --> 01:16:49,535
Is it a federal jail

1206
01:16:52,351 --> 01:16:52,863
Academy

1207
01:16:55,167 --> 01:16:56,447
Feeling the fire of Truth

1208
01:16:57,727 --> 01:16:58,239
That's a good thing

1209
01:17:04,383 --> 01:17:06,175
But we should expect

1210
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:09,247
It got a little Belgium

1211
01:17:10,783 --> 01:17:12,319
And we should accept it like

1212
01:17:12,575 --> 01:17:13,087
Christ

1213
01:17:14,623 --> 01:17:15,647
Scattered ideals

1214
01:17:19,743 --> 01:17:21,023
Because there is no

1215
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:26,399
There is no defeat

1216
01:17:32,031 --> 01:17:33,055
I feel guilty

1217
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:34,591
In moments like this

1218
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:36,383
Well my family is mean

1219
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:37,407
Persecuted

1220
01:17:37,663 --> 01:17:38,687
What I've done

1221
01:17:38,943 --> 01:17:39,967
But I am an ex

1222
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:40,991
Stussy next

1223
01:17:41,247 --> 01:17:41,759
Christ

1224
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:44,063
If anything I am

1225
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:44,831
Guilty

1226
01:17:45,087 --> 01:17:45,855
But I am in such

1227
01:17:46,367 --> 01:17:48,159
Eiffel Tower

1228
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:49,183
Why is your

1229
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:50,207
During this moment

1230
01:17:51,743 --> 01:17:52,255
No I understand

1231
01:17:52,511 --> 01:17:53,279
This is amazing

1232
01:17:58,399 --> 01:17:59,679
Would you like a fragrance

1233
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:01,215
They're all going to drown.

1234
01:18:01,983 --> 01:18:04,287
What are you doing

1235
01:18:04,543 --> 01:18:06,335
What are you doing

1236
01:18:10,943 --> 01:18:15,039
You know what I what I hear happened cuz I think your

1237
01:18:15,295 --> 01:18:17,343
The spirit behind this broadcast

1238
01:18:17,855 --> 01:18:21,439
I really f***** up with that getting laid Maxwell stuff on my main show

1239
01:18:21,695 --> 01:18:22,719
I got to make this up

1240
01:18:22,975 --> 01:18:26,559
But that started from the first glass of whiskey gets up the shows like

1241
01:18:26,815 --> 01:18:27,583
That wasn't bad

1242
01:18:27,839 --> 01:18:29,119
Texas ebony like no

1243
01:18:29,631 --> 01:18:30,399
I really didn't do that good of a

1244
01:18:30,655 --> 01:18:36,799
The job takes another glass takes another glass I'm getting back on

1245
01:18:37,055 --> 01:18:40,383
Another glass

1246
01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:46,527
Starset

1247
01:18:46,783 --> 01:18:52,927
Alright that's what happened I would not be surprised

1248
01:18:53,183 --> 01:18:57,023
And I know

1249
01:18:57,279 --> 01:19:03,167
That I thought that that was the motivation for him during the second episode because

1250
01:19:03,423 --> 01:19:09,567
Okay alright

1251
01:19:09,823 --> 01:19:13,151
I thought it was good

1252
01:19:13,407 --> 01:19:15,711
Right here

1253
01:19:15,967 --> 01:19:16,991
You know I didn't get

1254
01:19:17,247 --> 01:19:18,527
Tell the news I wanted to cover today

1255
01:19:18,783 --> 01:19:19,807
4 Hour radio show

1256
01:19:22,623 --> 01:19:24,415
I'm going to cover all this big news

1257
01:19:26,463 --> 01:19:27,487
Hundreds of articles

1258
01:19:27,999 --> 01:19:29,023
Stream news live

1259
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:30,559
Efron

1260
01:19:30,815 --> 01:19:31,839
Hey it's all I

1261
01:19:36,191 --> 01:19:37,215
What is even appointed

1262
01:19:37,727 --> 01:19:41,311
There are people that want to believe a lie

1263
01:19:45,151 --> 01:19:46,175
You should talk about that

1264
01:19:46,431 --> 01:19:48,223
He's talked about that

1265
01:19:57,439 --> 01:20:03,583
Why pretty early in this special report he's already having an existential crisis

1266
01:20:03,839 --> 01:20:06,911
Is worth doing to begin with

1267
01:20:07,423 --> 01:20:08,959
It's unable to delete browser

1268
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:13,567
Nail driver

1269
01:20:13,824 --> 01:20:16,128

We're going to start the stuff

1271
01:20:18,432 --> 01:20:21,248
Start so now Alex

01:20:25,344 --> 01:20:26,624
Imagining told in court

1275
01:20:28,416 --> 01:20:28,928

Against the mask

1280
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:41,216
Covid-19 lockdown

1281
01:20:41,472 --> 01:20:42,752
Wasn't even a law

1282
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:44,800
And

1283
01:20:45,312 --> 01:20:46,848
I didn't have a lot of do it but

1284
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:48,384
Because I'm a judge

1285
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:50,432
I'm going to take

01:20:50,944 --> 01:20:51,456

And yeah that doesn't scare me because

That's what your whole new world order is

1295
01:21:09,632 --> 01:21:10,656
What you didn't think

1296
01:21:11,168 --> 01:21:12,704
You wanted my children

1297
01:21:13,984 --> 01:21:15,008
Already

1298
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:17,568
Committed

1299
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:19,360
Did they were burned

1300
01:21:19,872 --> 01:21:20,384
To fight you

1301
01:21:24,736 --> 01:21:25,760
You fake

1302
01:21:28,064 --> 01:21:30,624
Big geyser.

1303
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:32,416
Attack my children

1304
01:21:34,976 --> 01:21:36,512
Maybe something for your wife sir

1305
01:21:38,048 --> 01:21:39,072
Gold-plated

1306
01:21:39,328 --> 01:21:39,840
You want to rape

1307
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:41,120
Thank you

1308
01:21:41,632 --> 01:21:42,656
Coco Chanel

1309
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:43,936
No no

1310
01:21:48,032 --> 01:21:48,544
Hellofresh

1311
01:21:50,336 --> 01:21:51,616
The kill the other people

1312
01:21:52,128 --> 01:21:53,152
Will kill you

1313
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:54,944
You'll kill me

1314
01:21:56,992 --> 01:21:58,528
You're my soul and I join you

1315
01:21:58,784 --> 01:22:00,576
You don't think I know you are

1316
01:22:00,832 --> 01:22:02,368
This is a mess

1317
01:22:02,624 --> 01:22:05,184
Wow so

1318
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:06,208
Speaking to

1319
01:22:06,464 --> 01:22:06,976
To a judge

1320
01:22:07,232 --> 01:22:13,376
I think Alex might have be dealing with more competition

1321
01:22:13,632 --> 01:22:19,776
Ex-wife Alex stop bringing this to the air

1322
01:22:20,032 --> 01:22:23,104
Mass protests

1323
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:24,640
The safety and well-being of

1324
01:22:24,896 --> 01:22:25,408
Children

1325
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:30,784
Stop it stop it honey we were going to get

1326
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:34,880
Chinese food tonight we were going to sit and we're going to watch this movie we've been looking for

1327
01:22:35,136 --> 01:22:41,280
Well my boss got drunk in the judge got mad at him for going to an illegal rally cuz he's an evil assholes

1328
01:22:41,536 --> 01:22:46,400
So I'm getting hold of boom mic for the next few hours this is embarrassing that sucks

1329
01:22:46,656 --> 01:22:50,496
This is a real bad luck

1330
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:56,640
For your Champion Heroes crusading tip of the spear

1331
01:22:56,896 --> 01:23:01,248
This is a bad luck you're supposed to be making up for not doing your job

1332
01:23:01,504 --> 01:23:07,648
And you appear to be drunk crying and laughing about how your kids are already dead to you

1333
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:11,488
Holyshit

1334
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:15,072
That's a very normal and comforting

1335
01:23:16,608 --> 01:23:17,888
Wow

1336
01:23:21,472 --> 01:23:22,752
I will warn all of you watch

1337
01:23:23,776 --> 01:23:24,544
And all you listening

1338
01:23:25,824 --> 01:23:27,872
We have committed crimes against God

1339
01:23:28,384 --> 01:23:29,152
Benjamin Prime

1340
01:23:30,688 --> 01:23:31,712
We are going to be judged

1341
01:23:31,968 --> 01:23:33,248
This planet is going to be burned

1342
01:23:33,504 --> 01:23:34,272
Maycrest

1343
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:37,088
You better get right with God damn

1344
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:38,368
You better start

1345
01:23:38,624 --> 01:23:39,136
Fearing

1346
01:23:39,904 --> 01:23:41,696
Engineer that built the universe

1347
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:43,232
Instead of bowing down to these

1348
01:23:43,488 --> 01:23:44,000
Midget

1349
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:45,792
You have been warned

1350
01:23:49,632 --> 01:23:50,656
I don't sacrifice

1351
01:23:50,912 --> 01:23:52,192
The fight against in World War

1352
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:57,312
There's no children didn't belong to meet him at

1353
01:24:02,688 --> 01:24:05,760
A lot of room for free

1354
01:24:12,416 --> 01:24:14,464
Trying to cover some headlines

1355
01:24:17,536 --> 01:24:23,680
This is Abby on Paradiso this is exactly what you would do if you were Perry being this this is

1356
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:25,472
Pretty wild

1357
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:26,496
So Alex gets

1358
01:24:26,752 --> 01:24:30,336
Headline here

1359
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:32,640
Here's the Atlantic

1360
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:33,920
What's the CIA

1361
01:24:36,992 --> 01:24:37,504
That

1362
01:24:38,528 --> 01:24:39,296
Count everybody

1363
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:41,088
With a

1364
01:24:44,416 --> 01:24:45,440
You already got over it

1365
01:24:45,952 --> 01:24:46,720
And people

1366
01:24:47,488 --> 01:24:48,000
But don't have it

1367
01:24:50,304 --> 01:24:51,328
Why would they put that out

1368
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:52,864
So dumb they're coming around

1369
01:24:53,632 --> 01:24:56,960
First things first is Atlantic article is from May 21st

1370
01:24:57,216 --> 01:24:59,008
So it's not exactly breaking news

1371
01:24:59,776 --> 01:25:05,664
It was about how there were test results included in the cdc's numbers the viral and antibody

1372
01:25:06,176 --> 01:25:07,712
Which most experts agreed with

1373
01:25:07,968 --> 01:25:08,480
Confusing

1374
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:13,600
Try to determine current infection where I am to past infects

1375
01:25:14,368 --> 01:25:19,488
This error was identified and as of early maybe it was resolved

1376
01:25:19,744 --> 01:25:20,256
Test results

1377
01:25:21,024 --> 01:25:27,168
A big part of the issue is the different states recorded their numbers differently in reporting

1378
01:25:27,424 --> 01:25:29,728
Antibody test as a single figure

1379
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:33,824
The big issue here though is that this mistake would only make the Opera

1380
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:34,592
Break

1381
01:25:34,848 --> 01:25:37,408
Far less severe than it would otherwise

1382
01:25:38,176 --> 01:25:42,784
The reason is the antibody tests are meant to be administered to the General Public

1383
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:45,856
Which are meant to be given to people you suspect of being sick

1384
01:25:47,136 --> 01:25:48,416
Because of their differing applications

1385
01:25:48,672 --> 01:25:54,048
You have a built-in assumption that the rate of positive results in an antibody test

1386
01:25:55,072 --> 01:26:00,192
Positive results

1387
01:26:00,448 --> 01:26:01,984
Metric

1388
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:08,384
Negative antibody test will give a tendency to drive down a positive result

1389
01:26:09,408 --> 01:26:11,456
Atlantic article

1390
01:26:11,712 --> 01:26:17,856
If even a third of the country's gain and testing is come by expanding antibody test not viral test

1391
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:19,392
To detect an outbreak is much

1392
01:26:19,648 --> 01:26:20,416
Smaller than it seems

1393
01:26:21,184 --> 01:26:27,328
There's no way to ascertain how much of the recent increase in testing is from antibody test until the most populous states in the country

1394
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:32,448
Among them Texas Georgia and Pebbles show their residents everything in the data

1395
01:26:33,216 --> 01:26:35,520
This is an interesting story and it isn't nothing

1396
01:26:36,032 --> 01:26:40,384
But understood in its proper context and not just read is it completely unexplored helpline

1397
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:44,992
This story does not support the argument that covid-19 is a fraud or the numbers are overblown

1398
01:26:45,504 --> 01:26:48,576
If anything it suggests that things are worse than they look

1399
01:26:50,112 --> 01:26:51,392
Well I'm not just that but it's

1400
01:26:51,648 --> 01:26:52,416
Just pointing out

1401
01:26:52,672 --> 01:26:54,464
Another massive failing

1402
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:55,488
In terms of

1403
01:26:55,744 --> 01:26:57,536
Having a coordinated Federal response

1404
01:26:57,792 --> 01:26:59,328
Through every single state

1405
01:26:59,584 --> 01:27:02,400
Doing things differently is only f****** everything up

1406
01:27:02,912 --> 01:27:06,240
So having a coordinated Federal response with a strong leadership

1407
01:27:06,496 --> 01:27:08,288
That will be able to kind of

1408
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:16,224
Streamline this whole process is going to go a long way toward mitigating

1409
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:21,344
Nothing but masturbated

1410
01:27:23,392 --> 01:27:27,488
Explorer doll doesn't really do anything other than say

1411
01:27:29,536 --> 01:27:30,304
But don't worry

1412
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:33,120
New study says black lives matter protest

1413
01:27:33,888 --> 01:27:34,656
Slow the spread

1414
01:27:35,936 --> 01:27:36,448
They probably

1415
01:27:36,704 --> 01:27:37,984
By creating antibodies

1416
01:27:38,752 --> 01:27:44,896
How to talk about a study was carried out by a research team has co-authored by a professor from the University of

1417
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:46,432
Andrew free

1418
01:27:47,456 --> 01:27:53,600
The basic gist of the paper is an examination of the net result black lives matter protest

1419
01:27:55,904 --> 01:27:56,416
Something Behavior

1420
01:27:57,184 --> 01:27:58,208
From the study

1421
01:27:58,464 --> 01:28:03,328
Well the protests themselves were large Gatherings that do not match well with social distancing guidelines

1422
01:28:03,584 --> 01:28:07,680
The protesting population is not the only one that may have a behavioral response

1423
01:28:08,192 --> 01:28:11,776
For example other individuals who do not wish to participate in the protest

1424
01:28:12,032 --> 01:28:15,616
Perhaps due to fear of violence from police clashes or general unrest

1425
01:28:15,872 --> 01:28:19,200
May have chosen to avoid public spaces while protest or underway

1426
01:28:19,712 --> 01:28:24,832
This could have an offsetting effect increasing social distancing behavior in other parts of the population

1427
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:27,648
Their result they found was quote

1428
01:28:27,904 --> 01:28:33,280
Using Anonymous cell phone tracking data from safegraph incorporated as well as data on the local

1429
01:28:33,536 --> 01:28:34,816
Covid-19 from the centers

1430
01:28:35,072 --> 01:28:36,352
For Disease Control and prevention

1431
01:28:36,864 --> 01:28:43,008
We demonstrate that cities which had protest saw an increase in Social distancing behavior for the overall General popular

1432
01:28:43,264 --> 01:28:45,312
Cities that did not

1433
01:28:45,824 --> 01:28:47,104
In addition we find no evidence

1434
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:52,480
Net covid-19 case growth differential Eros following the onset of black lives matter protest

1435
01:28:52,736 --> 01:28:58,368
And even a modest evidence of small longer-run case growth decline

1436
01:28:59,648 --> 01:29:04,256
The argument has papers making his one that Alex doesn't understand

1437
01:29:05,024 --> 01:29:06,048
He's an incompetent

1438
01:29:06,304 --> 01:29:09,888
Probably drunk baby

1439
01:29:13,216 --> 01:29:14,496
It is in also

1440
01:29:15,264 --> 01:29:18,336
What you see there is so

1441
01:29:20,384 --> 01:29:22,176
All of these guys all of these

1442
01:29:22,688 --> 01:29:25,760
Bulshit propagandists want to create a cause and effect

1443
01:29:26,272 --> 01:29:27,040
As a as a

1444
01:29:27,296 --> 01:29:30,112
Its own kind of simple streamlined

1445
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:33,184
Somebody does this and that means this happy

1446
01:29:33,952 --> 01:29:36,256
What they're demonstrating is that

1447
01:29:36,512 --> 01:29:40,608
It is an impossibly large system with an infant number very

1448
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:43,936
So you saying over because this happened to this happen

1449
01:29:44,192 --> 01:29:49,056
You don't understand you couldn't even imagine why they would do like oh well

1450
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:54,944
There's other behaviors that change around

1451
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:58,528
A massive system as opposed to being an action by a person

1452
01:29:58,784 --> 01:30:00,576
Right right

1453
01:30:00,832 --> 01:30:05,696
Analysis

1454
01:30:06,208 --> 01:30:06,976
The protests

1455
01:30:07,232 --> 01:30:11,328
We're done in a way that was rejecting of Public Health

1456
01:30:11,584 --> 01:30:13,376
Is everybody

1457
01:30:13,632 --> 01:30:19,776
He was going out with their best to keep distant from

1458
01:30:20,032 --> 01:30:26,176
Become super spreading event

1459
01:30:26,432 --> 01:30:31,296
And under those circumstances I imagine that this analysis by these researchers

1460
01:30:31,552 --> 01:30:32,064
Quite different

1461
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:33,344
But because

1462
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:34,112
They are

1463
01:30:34,368 --> 01:30:37,184
Tr2

1464
01:30:40,256 --> 01:30:42,048
Spend some questions about like

1465
01:30:42,304 --> 01:30:45,376
Exactly how definitively we should treat this

1466
01:30:45,632 --> 01:30:48,192
I'm just talking about like Alex doesn't even understand

1467
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:52,032
911

1468
01:30:54,336 --> 01:30:57,664
So with terms of like

1469
01:30:58,688 --> 01:30:59,200
Substance

1470
01:30:59,712 --> 01:31:05,600
That's a good way to put it that's why I was going to go for us

1471
01:31:07,904 --> 01:31:09,184
There's something about

1472
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:09,952
Scares

1473
01:31:10,208 --> 01:31:10,976
Because yeah most

1474
01:31:11,232 --> 01:31:12,000
Yubals here

1475
01:31:13,536 --> 01:31:14,048
What

1476
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:15,328
Power

1477
01:31:17,632 --> 01:31:18,912
Because the real

1478
01:31:19,424 --> 01:31:20,192
Christ energy

1479
01:31:21,216 --> 01:31:21,728
Seeds

1480
01:31:23,008 --> 01:31:24,544
All the evil

1481
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:25,312
Buzzards

1482
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:26,592
When

1483
01:31:28,384 --> 01:31:29,408
Vampire bat

1484
01:31:32,224 --> 01:31:32,992
And karaoke

1485
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:34,528
Hippogriffs

1486
01:31:36,832 --> 01:31:39,392
J.k. Rowling's going to sue you for that

1487
01:31:39,904 --> 01:31:40,416
There was some

1488
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:42,208
Special day

1489
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:47,072
And what was it

1490
01:31:48,864 --> 01:31:49,632
Virtue sex

1491
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:52,704
700

1492
01:31:53,216 --> 01:31:53,728
We care about that

1493
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:54,752
Cadillac

1494
01:31:56,288 --> 01:31:56,800
It was

1495
01:31:57,056 --> 01:31:57,824
We believe in human

1496
01:31:58,592 --> 01:32:01,664
No matter what color they are is they've got strength

1497
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:02,688
We want to work

1498
01:32:02,944 --> 01:32:05,760
What day I'm and we want to unify around

1499
01:32:10,112 --> 01:32:11,648
Of course we'd realize that

1500
01:32:11,904 --> 01:32:12,672
When we first

1501
01:32:12,928 --> 01:32:13,696
Got the eye

1502
01:32:15,744 --> 01:32:17,024
Idea

1503
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:18,048
To build a house

1504
01:32:18,816 --> 01:32:21,376
What

1505
01:32:22,656 --> 01:32:23,424
Build a farm

1506
01:32:23,936 --> 01:32:24,448
It takes time

1507
01:32:24,704 --> 01:32:25,728
Time what

1508
01:32:27,264 --> 01:32:33,408
It takes time and you know maybe you start up by enslaving

1509
01:32:33,664 --> 01:32:39,808
Humans if you have power we want you to work for us for free and then if you build

1510
01:32:40,064 --> 01:32:46,208
Well there's that

1511
01:32:47,488 --> 01:32:50,048
What we didn't know it was bad at first

1512
01:32:50,304 --> 01:32:51,072
Or the third

1513
01:32:51,328 --> 01:32:57,472
Time or the seventh time for The Zephyr all those people back then were saying slavery

1514
01:32:57,728 --> 01:33:01,824
Really bad do you have to listen to them when they spoke

1515
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:02,848
What are you talk

1516
01:33:04,384 --> 01:33:04,896
Whatever

1517
01:33:05,152 --> 01:33:09,248
My God that's a fun way to look at history and accurately

1518
01:33:09,504 --> 01:33:14,112
More fun

1519
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:15,392
What is

1520
01:33:15,648 --> 01:33:16,416
With these people

1521
01:33:16,672 --> 01:33:17,952
So look dude

1522
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,560
This is very

1523
01:33:23,584 --> 01:33:25,888
You need Jesus

1524
01:33:27,424 --> 01:33:30,752
Wings to reach for Jesus to get him to open those wings

1525
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:32,288
Atheists

1526
01:33:32,544 --> 01:33:34,080
What about 15 through smart

1527
01:33:35,104 --> 01:33:36,896
Zout

1528
01:33:37,152 --> 01:33:38,944
They only think they're smart

1529
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:39,968
Because Satanist

1530
01:33:40,224 --> 01:33:44,832
You can be an atheist all day long you're really smart

1531
01:33:45,344 --> 01:33:47,904
You get ahold you don't believe in God ouv

1532
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:48,928
And animal

1533
01:33:49,184 --> 01:33:50,208
Oh you're so smart

1534
01:33:51,232 --> 01:33:52,000
You have a defense

1535
01:33:52,256 --> 01:33:53,536
Good behind the scenes

1536
01:33:53,792 --> 01:33:55,328
There in front of pentagram

1537
01:33:55,584 --> 01:33:57,632
They're killing babies their devil worship

1538
01:33:59,936 --> 01:34:06,080
You're God's got a thousand trillion * a power they don't know what to do

1539
01:34:07,616 --> 01:34:09,408
Because you're God.

1540
01:34:14,528 --> 01:34:15,040
They don't have any power

1541
01:34:16,832 --> 01:34:17,344
What

1542
01:34:20,928 --> 01:34:21,440
All they have is

1543
01:34:21,696 --> 01:34:22,208
The power

1544
01:34:24,512 --> 01:34:25,024
A pistol gun

1545
01:34:27,072 --> 01:34:28,608
That's pretty powerful on reality

1546
01:34:28,864 --> 01:34:29,888
The best Uncommon Sense

1547
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:31,936
Piss on their own instincts

1548
01:34:32,192 --> 01:34:32,960
So much piss

1549
01:34:33,984 --> 01:34:35,008
Who is this

1550
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:40,896
Pissed off just a just a real

1551
01:34:41,408 --> 01:34:45,248
So this leads into a long rant about Bill Gates wanting to kill you

1552
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:51,904
Is the sentence that is normal to have on any other podcast

1553
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:52,928
Instep

1554
01:34:53,184 --> 01:34:59,328
And he Alex does explain the like is 100,000 people all pray for Bill Gates to go down

1555
01:34:59,584 --> 01:35:01,120
We don't have that right

1556
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:07,264
Not trying to dominate you they're not trying to go

1557
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:09,824
That's that's phase one

1558
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:11,360
They want you

1559
01:35:13,408 --> 01:35:14,944
He wants every damn person he looks at

1560
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:16,992
Because he hates himself

1561
01:35:18,528 --> 01:35:19,040
Everybody

1562
01:35:19,808 --> 01:35:20,320
Everyday

1563
01:35:32,096 --> 01:35:32,608
So

1564
01:35:34,912 --> 01:35:35,680
I should probably get all the

1565
01:35:39,776 --> 01:35:40,800
I want to come up here

1566
01:35:41,056 --> 01:35:41,568
Commercial free

1567
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:42,848
I talked about

1568
01:35:43,104 --> 01:35:43,872
Reality

1569
01:35:46,176 --> 01:35:46,688
The planet

1570
01:35:47,968 --> 01:35:48,992
And the reality of the

1571
01:35:49,248 --> 01:35:50,528
Decisions that are being made

1572
01:35:50,784 --> 01:35:51,296
Now

1573
01:35:51,552 --> 01:35:52,320
Between you and God

1574
01:35:54,112 --> 01:35:54,880
Between you and

1575
01:35:55,136 --> 01:35:55,648
Eternity

1576
01:35:55,904 --> 01:36:02,048
Quit that's what's going on

1577
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:03,584
What happened

1578
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:05,888
I definitely did not get drunk

1579
01:36:06,144 --> 01:36:09,216
After having a bad go round with my ex-wife

1580
01:36:09,472 --> 01:36:12,800
And feel the need to vent like a child on air

1581
01:36:13,056 --> 01:36:15,360
That is that's not what happened at all.

1582
01:36:15,616 --> 01:36:17,920
Not at all and if you're thinking

1583
01:36:18,688 --> 01:36:24,064
You're a globalist raise a vampire vampire bat

1584
01:36:24,576 --> 01:36:26,624
So NSX go about starts about

1585
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:33,024
You know like everyone had slaves so it wasn't that bad of a thing ever

1586
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:37,376
Student version of temporal ethics

1587
01:36:39,936 --> 01:36:40,704
Every

1588
01:36:41,984 --> 01:36:44,032
Sector they weren't nations in their region

1589
01:36:46,336 --> 01:36:46,848
So what

1590
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:48,640
It's not a good thing is that a bad thing

1591
01:36:48,896 --> 01:36:49,664
What

1592
01:36:51,712 --> 01:36:54,272
50 million years ago reading stuff I mean it's like

1593
01:36:54,528 --> 01:36:55,040
What does that mean

1594
01:36:55,552 --> 01:36:59,136
Well those are animals and morality

1595
01:37:00,928 --> 01:37:03,232
He's implying their independence

1596
01:37:03,488 --> 01:37:04,256
I don't know

1597
01:37:09,376 --> 01:37:14,752
I think he's still around

1598
01:37:15,008 --> 01:37:19,872
There is absolute moral relativism

1599
01:37:20,384 --> 01:37:26,528
Because then everyone had slaves it's neither good nor bad

1600
01:37:27,808 --> 01:37:28,576
I mean

1601
01:37:28,832 --> 01:37:31,904
The implications of that are are are heroin

1602
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:33,696
I mean like if you could just

1603
01:37:33,952 --> 01:37:37,792
Any issue that you want to talk about it like whether it's no he's super against

1604
01:37:38,048 --> 01:37:40,608
Abortion but if everybody is fine

1605
01:37:40,864 --> 01:37:41,632
He can't

1606
01:37:42,144 --> 01:37:47,008
You can't think that it's because there's something known as morality

1607
01:37:47,264 --> 01:37:53,408
I went through all the time because

1608
01:37:53,664 --> 01:37:59,808
The past what it was either wrong or right in the path well it's wrong now but that's not as bad as abortion

1609
01:38:00,832 --> 01:38:02,624
I mean like there was

1610
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:09,024
You know there were times and civilizations where you know Alex talks a lot about how like human sacrifices so

1611
01:38:09,536 --> 01:38:11,328
Horribly wrong

1612
01:38:11,584 --> 01:38:15,168
Cultures that did it in the past

1613
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:16,448
You know

1614
01:38:18,496 --> 01:38:23,360
You see where this really off track

1615
01:38:23,616 --> 01:38:24,128
Pretty quickly

1616
01:38:24,896 --> 01:38:26,688
Just ever is Easter

1617
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:29,504
I know exactly what

1618
01:38:30,272 --> 01:38:32,832
I know that white people enslaved

1619
01:38:33,344 --> 01:38:34,624
I know it was wrong

1620
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:38,208
I know my success is built around stolen labor

1621
01:38:38,464 --> 01:38:39,744
Stolen value

1622
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:40,512
Stolen Life

1623
01:38:41,024 --> 01:38:41,536
I know all

1624
01:38:42,048 --> 01:38:43,840
I don't want to feel bad about

1625
01:38:44,608 --> 01:38:45,632
So slavery's fine

1626
01:38:46,144 --> 01:38:52,288
History of Christianity

1627
01:38:52,544 --> 01:38:54,592
Particular

1628
01:38:54,848 --> 01:38:55,360
It is

1629
01:38:55,616 --> 01:39:01,760
The thing that stopped all bad things

1630
01:39:02,016 --> 01:39:04,832
Ever but why Christianity came around and 6

1631
01:39:05,088 --> 01:39:07,648
And that is the thought that he's working through here

1632
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:09,952
Everything is chaos

1633
01:39:10,208 --> 01:39:11,232
Until Jesus

1634
01:39:11,488 --> 01:39:12,000
White Jeep

1635
01:39:14,816 --> 01:39:15,840
Africa

1636
01:39:16,096 --> 01:39:17,632
500 years ago was here we go

1637
01:39:17,888 --> 01:39:18,400
Warzone

1638
01:39:18,656 --> 01:39:19,680
Here we go

1639
01:39:21,216 --> 01:39:21,984
So is Japan

1640
01:39:23,008 --> 01:39:23,520
So was

1641
01:39:23,776 --> 01:39:24,288
What's in Russia

1642
01:39:26,336 --> 01:39:27,104
What we do

1643
01:39:28,640 --> 01:39:30,432
We're so successful species

1644
01:39:30,944 --> 01:39:33,504
We take over we grow crops we build palaces

1645
01:39:36,064 --> 01:39:37,088
That's our neighbor

1646
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:39,136
He's got a problem and we're going to catch

1647
01:39:40,672 --> 01:39:41,184
Until

1648
01:39:41,696 --> 01:39:42,208
Jesus

1649
01:39:42,464 --> 01:39:42,976
Christ

1650
01:39:43,232 --> 01:39:43,744
Comes along

1651
01:39:45,536 --> 01:39:47,584
And says we need to love each other

1652
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:48,608
And love God

1653
01:39:48,864 --> 01:39:49,632
And we need to build a snow

1654
01:39:49,888 --> 01:39:50,656
Society together

1655
01:39:50,912 --> 01:39:52,192
We need to stand for justice

1656
01:39:52,448 --> 01:39:52,960
Freedom

1657
01:39:53,216 --> 01:39:53,984
We go to the Stars

1658
01:39:57,568 --> 01:39:59,360
That's why you had Rwanda

1659
01:40:01,152 --> 01:40:03,968
Was Christian less than 10% of population

1660
01:40:04,224 --> 01:40:05,760
All the well

1661
01:40:06,272 --> 01:40:07,296
The other root word animus

1662
01:40:07,808 --> 01:40:08,832
They couldn't do anything they

1663
01:40:09,088 --> 01:40:09,856
They could get them.

1664
01:40:11,648 --> 01:40:12,672
The same genetics

1665
01:40:13,952 --> 01:40:15,744
Chrono

1666
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:17,280
An export deals

1667
01:40:17,792 --> 01:40:18,304
Jobs

1668
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:21,888
XSport

1669
01:40:22,912 --> 01:40:23,680
And now it's

1670
01:40:24,192 --> 01:40:26,752
Might want to look into Rwandan history a little bit

1671
01:40:28,544 --> 01:40:30,080
That's really close

1672
01:40:30,336 --> 01:40:32,128
To what you might call

1673
01:40:32,384 --> 01:40:37,760
Revisionist

1674
01:40:38,016 --> 01:40:38,528
Ensure

1675
01:40:40,832 --> 01:40:41,856
Rwanda

1676
01:40:42,112 --> 01:40:43,648
Dynamics

1677
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:45,184
It's really upsetting

1678
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:49,024
Yeah from a lack of information standpoint

1679
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:51,840
And then from a using this atrocity this

1680
01:40:52,096 --> 01:40:53,376
Score of human history

1681
01:40:53,632 --> 01:40:55,936
As some sort of a prop in your leg

1682
01:40:56,192 --> 01:40:57,472
Jesus

1683
01:40:57,728 --> 01:40:59,776
Made

1684
01:41:00,032 --> 01:41:05,920
These people prosperous whereas these other ones not it's it's

1685
01:41:06,176 --> 01:41:07,968
It really is it's but it's made of

1686
01:41:08,224 --> 01:41:08,992
To the point of life

1687
01:41:10,016 --> 01:41:14,368
11th century kind of thinking in order to get people to go to the

1688
01:41:14,624 --> 01:41:15,136
Crusades

1689
01:41:15,648 --> 01:41:16,160
It's it's

1690
01:41:16,928 --> 01:41:18,464
Like we're supposed to be Beyond

1691
01:41:19,232 --> 01:41:20,512
Do you know it's 2020

1692
01:41:20,768 --> 01:41:22,560
Alex isn't when he's drunk

1693
01:41:23,072 --> 01:41:23,840
So I think

1694
01:41:24,096 --> 01:41:27,936
Alex realizes after rambling for quite a while that

1695
01:41:28,704 --> 01:41:29,728
Isn't talking about anything

1696
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:34,336
He's not hitting these new stories not what's going on supposedly supposed to be doing

1697
01:41:34,848 --> 01:41:40,992
Answer he calls for a special report

1698
01:41:41,248 --> 01:41:42,272
Middle of the night

1699
01:41:42,528 --> 01:41:43,040
Great Mall

1700
01:41:46,624 --> 01:41:47,136
I don't know what's

1701
01:41:48,672 --> 01:41:49,696
Tell me about Alaska

1702
01:41:49,952 --> 01:41:52,000
Program

1703
01:41:52,768 --> 01:41:54,560
Exercise

1704
01:41:58,656 --> 01:41:59,168
Number 7

1705
01:42:03,008 --> 01:42:06,080
Infomercial but hasn't already discussed imported formation

1706
01:42:06,336 --> 01:42:07,872
Will Air this and I'll come back on

1707
01:42:08,640 --> 01:42:09,152
Okay

1708
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:16,064
Cool do they sleep in the basement

1709
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:21,952
Even imagine what they're going through what is going on

1710
01:42:23,488 --> 01:42:24,768
Cuz if you're committed to the

1711
01:42:25,024 --> 01:42:28,864
Protective you can't be happy with that

1712
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:31,168
If you're someone who's just like a slick

1713
01:42:31,424 --> 01:42:36,544
Fraud con person

1714
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:38,848
No matter what the end

1715
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:40,640
This is what I was saying

1716
01:42:40,896 --> 01:42:43,200
Earlier when you said

1717
01:42:43,456 --> 01:42:49,600
Haywood they can bleep out someone saying s*** but he can't believe about him threatening

1718
01:42:49,856 --> 01:42:51,392
General is a murderer

1719
01:42:51,648 --> 01:42:54,976
You don't have to post that you just turn it off this is 2 hours

1720
01:42:55,232 --> 01:42:57,024
It's not Live still on video

1721
01:42:57,280 --> 01:43:01,888
Good

1722
01:43:02,144 --> 01:43:04,704
It's too good of contair is almost

1723
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:05,472
Nothing

1724
01:43:05,728 --> 01:43:08,800
Worth your time in this entire two hours

1725
01:43:09,056 --> 01:43:13,152
Unless you're you and me and you like to laugh and how we stay weird stuff

1726
01:43:16,224 --> 01:43:17,248
This was a gift to us

1727
01:43:17,504 --> 01:43:23,648
Special Report little bit longer to find

1728
01:43:23,904 --> 01:43:24,672
Adam Schiff

1729
01:43:25,184 --> 01:43:26,464
Doesn't have a soul

1730
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:29,280
Process I think he accidentally

1731
01:43:30,304 --> 01:43:32,608
Support something that he's supposed to be totally against

1732
01:43:35,936 --> 01:43:39,008
You want that guy babysit your kids I mean look at that is not

1733
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:42,592
Why that is a psychotic

1734
01:43:43,104 --> 01:43:43,872
Program

1735
01:43:44,384 --> 01:43:44,896
Blue

1736
01:43:45,152 --> 01:43:45,920
The kill us because

1737
01:43:46,432 --> 01:43:47,200
That's all it knows I'm

1738
01:43:47,968 --> 01:43:51,040
Oblivion

1739
01:43:51,296 --> 01:43:52,064
Outcomes

1740
01:43:52,576 --> 01:43:53,344
Tom Cruise

1741
01:43:57,184 --> 01:43:58,208
I mean

1742
01:43:58,464 --> 01:43:58,976
That's what it is

1743
01:43:59,488 --> 01:44:00,512
He doesn't know

1744
01:44:03,584 --> 01:44:05,632
And it's not a mean thing to say that about him

1745
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:07,680
But he doesn't have a soul

1746
01:44:12,544 --> 01:44:14,080
Because when you got a man or woman

1747
01:44:14,336 --> 01:44:15,360
I figure this out

1748
01:44:15,872 --> 01:44:16,640
Several generation

1749
01:44:18,432 --> 01:44:19,456
They start having kids

1750
01:44:19,712 --> 01:44:20,736
They don't even have a life

1751
01:44:22,528 --> 01:44:23,808
And nobody push that book

1752
01:44:24,064 --> 01:44:24,576
I'm just telling you that's why

1753
01:44:25,856 --> 01:44:26,624
Is that

1754
01:44:28,672 --> 01:44:29,440
People like

1755
01:44:29,696 --> 01:44:30,208
Chef

1756
01:44:31,744 --> 01:44:33,280
Your elevator doesn't go to the top

1757
01:44:34,304 --> 01:44:35,584
I'm sure you've heard

1758
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:37,632
They don't go to the

1759
01:44:37,888 --> 01:44:38,400
Stop

1760
01:44:49,664 --> 01:44:50,176
Oblivion

1761
01:44:51,968 --> 01:44:52,480
Sommore

1762
01:44:53,248 --> 01:44:54,528
That's exactly what they got

1763
01:44:55,808 --> 01:44:56,832
Assassin revelation

1764
01:45:00,928 --> 01:45:02,208
A boy

1765
01:45:02,464 --> 01:45:03,488
Indeed

1766
01:45:03,744 --> 01:45:04,512
BoBoiBoy

1767
01:45:05,536 --> 01:45:09,376
So I'm glad Alex remember that he liked Oblivion

1768
01:45:09,888 --> 01:45:11,424
That is a positive

1769
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:17,824
I can't wait to hear more about that other episodes

1770
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:23,200
Tire goddamn explode

1771
01:45:24,992 --> 01:45:29,088
Change my life

1772
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:30,368
Heard it sucks

1773
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:37,280
The other thing there is it Alex

1774
01:45:37,536 --> 01:45:38,304
So

1775
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:39,840
No I did not know this

1776
01:45:40,096 --> 01:45:44,704
Yeah but you can breathe the soul out.

1777
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:46,240
Spurs

1778
01:45:46,496 --> 01:45:52,640
Seventh Generation generation

1779
01:45:52,896 --> 01:45:53,920
Can't imagine why

1780
01:45:54,432 --> 01:45:59,040
Because that's inherited language

1781
01:46:02,368 --> 01:46:03,392
Soligenix

1782
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:04,928
Is it a good

1783
01:46:05,184 --> 01:46:11,328
Can you breed a soul back into somebody

1784
01:46:11,584 --> 01:46:17,728
Applications the reverse would be true

1785
01:46:17,984 --> 01:46:19,264
If you do believe in me

1786
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:21,568
Christians should only be having

1787
01:46:21,824 --> 01:46:23,872
Kids without their

1788
01:46:24,384 --> 01:46:26,432
Write what a Satanist

1789
01:46:26,688 --> 01:46:27,968
Could pretend to be a Chris

1790
01:46:28,736 --> 01:46:34,880
Infiltrate a family and then slowly steal the souls of all who take a lot more generator

1791
01:46:35,648 --> 01:46:37,696
Oh bo bo Fool's errand

1792
01:46:37,952 --> 01:46:39,232
I'm I'm 150

1793
01:46:39,488 --> 01:46:40,512
1/16 Solas

1794
01:46:43,328 --> 01:46:49,216
It does feel like some of these weird thoughts that Alex has weird things about like

1795
01:46:49,984 --> 01:46:56,128
I hear you're talking about how these these people who want to like allow people to have birth control options

1796
01:46:56,384 --> 01:46:57,408
Maryville eugenicist

1797
01:46:57,664 --> 01:47:03,296
You talking about how like if people used to be devil worshippers have kids don't have less of a soul

1798
01:47:03,808 --> 01:47:05,088
Get the f*** out here

1799
01:47:05,344 --> 01:47:06,880
Anyway

1800
01:47:07,136 --> 01:47:09,184
The Special Report

1801
01:47:09,696 --> 01:47:11,488
And he was not wrong

1802
01:47:11,744 --> 01:47:12,512
It is an Informer

1803
01:47:13,024 --> 01:47:16,096
News about how to buy survival food

1804
01:47:17,120 --> 01:47:19,936
It's going down

1805
01:47:21,216 --> 01:47:22,496
Alex is so

1806
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:25,568
I'm proud of an infomercial to this true

1807
01:47:26,336 --> 01:47:27,872
Horrible food

1808
01:47:34,784 --> 01:47:35,296
You know

1809
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:37,856
It's not some building

1810
01:47:39,648 --> 01:47:44,512
Suspense thing where I get up here and I go I've got all these articles I've got all the Snows I can't talk

1811
01:47:46,816 --> 01:47:48,608
I just can't talk

1812
01:47:49,376 --> 01:47:50,656
I just can't do this anymore

1813
01:47:52,192 --> 01:47:53,472
But I felt driven the night

1814
01:47:53,728 --> 01:47:55,008
Flowers

1815
01:47:55,520 --> 01:47:56,800
Matt came in and

1816
01:47:57,056 --> 01:47:57,824
Daria

1817
01:47:59,360 --> 01:48:00,640
You know

1818
01:48:00,896 --> 01:48:03,200
I love you guys so much and he put up a bay

1819
01:48:03,456 --> 01:48:04,480
I appreciate that

1820
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:08,320
There's just a feeling like

1821
01:48:08,576 --> 01:48:09,600
We should fix it

1822
01:48:09,856 --> 01:48:11,136
Plane crash

1823
01:48:11,648 --> 01:48:13,952
It's all burn up is dead bodies on the field

1824
01:48:14,976 --> 01:48:16,256
We're just out there trying to like

1825
01:48:17,536 --> 01:48:18,816
Put it all back together again we just can

1826
01:48:20,096 --> 01:48:20,864
This is dark

1827
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:22,656
Wow wow

1828
01:48:23,168 --> 01:48:29,312
I don't know why I'm doing I can't even do my job anymore I have a bunch of pieces of paper and

1829
01:48:29,568 --> 01:48:31,104
In front of me

1830
01:48:31,872 --> 01:48:33,152
I just don't even

1831
01:48:33,408 --> 01:48:34,176
You know it's fun

1832
01:48:34,688 --> 01:48:37,248
And also a little bit better

1833
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:39,040
I think is a little bit

1834
01:48:39,552 --> 01:48:40,832
Early on in the show

1835
01:48:41,856 --> 01:48:43,136
This is Friday night

1836
01:48:43,392 --> 01:48:45,184
Releases this nuggets is Thursday night

1837
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:47,488
This is Thursday night Thursday night

1838
01:48:48,256 --> 01:48:49,536
At the very beginning of the show

1839
01:48:49,792 --> 01:48:53,632
We had just finished recording an episode if you would listen to that

1840
01:48:53,888 --> 01:48:54,400
European like

1841
01:48:54,912 --> 01:48:59,264
Get back in here we got to do an emergency episode

1842
01:48:59,776 --> 01:49:01,568
I don't know if I would have

1843
01:49:04,896 --> 01:49:07,712
That's kind of like it's a little ugly

1844
01:49:08,224 --> 01:49:11,296
I feel a little reinvigorated

1845
01:49:11,552 --> 01:49:16,160
It's not because of Alex's pain or anything like that this is kind of

1846
01:49:16,416 --> 01:49:17,952
Interesting

1847
01:49:18,208 --> 01:49:19,232
This is

1848
01:49:19,744 --> 01:49:25,376
This isn't just the rote repetition of the same thing

1849
01:49:25,632 --> 01:49:31,776
I can't do much I'm terrible I have all this

1850
01:49:32,032 --> 01:49:32,800
To say that

1851
01:49:33,312 --> 01:49:36,128
Is escalated to another level because

1852
01:49:36,384 --> 01:49:37,152
He clearly was

1853
01:49:37,408 --> 01:49:37,920
Crying

1854
01:49:38,176 --> 01:49:38,944
I know

1855
01:49:39,200 --> 01:49:45,344
He was clearly trying to do his job by hundred percent doing another 2 hours himself

1856
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:49,696
Capable of doing anything except it's saying nothing

1857
01:49:49,952 --> 01:49:50,976
It's all he can do

1858
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:57,376
I was sitting here and been thinking on this and trying to reflect on it like

1859
01:49:57,632 --> 01:49:58,912
He was just trying to

1860
01:49:59,424 --> 01:50:00,192
El Shaddai

1861
01:50:00,448 --> 01:50:03,776
But he's not really doesn't look like not constantly going

1862
01:50:04,032 --> 01:50:06,848
Cabela's products

1863
01:50:07,104 --> 01:50:09,920
He does play that infomercial in the middle of this but

1864
01:50:10,176 --> 01:50:12,736
At the end after the infomercial he's kind of

1865
01:50:13,248 --> 01:50:15,552
Yeah means you're going to buy food might as well buy from us

1866
01:50:15,808 --> 01:50:19,136
It's not the same kind of like we're doing a

1867
01:50:19,392 --> 01:50:22,720
QVC's act like he generally would do those like

1868
01:50:22,976 --> 01:50:24,512
30 hour marathon

1869
01:50:24,768 --> 01:50:26,048
This this is

1870
01:50:26,304 --> 01:50:28,096
To mean to be a guy who

1871
01:50:28,352 --> 01:50:34,496
Legitimately did his show on The Elaine Maxwell was arrested which is supposed to be sweet

1872
01:50:34,752 --> 01:50:36,032
And whatever for him

1873
01:50:36,288 --> 01:50:38,592
If you recognize that the end of it I punched

1874
01:50:38,848 --> 01:50:40,384
Did I did not do the job

1875
01:50:40,640 --> 01:50:44,736
Realizes he's lost his arm

1876
01:50:44,992 --> 01:50:46,272
If he doesn't have the pitch

1877
01:50:46,528 --> 01:50:47,040
Anymore

1878
01:50:47,296 --> 01:50:50,624
He does not have the same skills that he had as a younger man

1879
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:52,160
And

1880
01:50:52,416 --> 01:50:53,696
That to me is interesting

1881
01:50:53,952 --> 01:50:55,232
Yeah like that isn't

1882
01:50:56,768 --> 01:50:57,280
The content

1883
01:50:57,536 --> 01:50:58,048
Of course isn't there

1884
01:50:58,304 --> 01:51:01,888
But the emotional Arc of it is because you see the end of this

1885
01:51:02,144 --> 01:51:04,960
It's like he's f****** depressed as hell

1886
01:51:05,472 --> 01:51:11,616
Add himself yeah it's like this psychodrama here is is just like you said

1887
01:51:11,872 --> 01:51:13,920
Is that he this is not like his show

1888
01:51:14,176 --> 01:51:15,456
He's going to go to work

1889
01:51:15,968 --> 01:51:18,016
That's what he does as he's got a nine-to-five

1890
01:51:18,272 --> 01:51:19,040
This is special

1891
01:51:19,808 --> 01:51:21,856
This is there's some intent behind the

1892
01:51:22,368 --> 01:51:25,440
And the intent is very clearly

1893
01:51:25,696 --> 01:51:31,840
Which is something we do not hear him do whatever I don't know if I trust that

1894
01:51:32,096 --> 01:51:33,120
Pretense of Italy

1895
01:51:34,144 --> 01:51:36,192
And then

1896
01:51:36,704 --> 01:51:40,032
He's full of s***

1897
01:51:42,848 --> 01:51:44,896
Like as he's talking he's learning he's like

1898
01:51:45,152 --> 01:51:46,944
I don't have anything to say

1899
01:51:48,736 --> 01:51:54,880
I mean early in the evening report he says

1900
01:51:55,136 --> 01:51:58,720
I didn't cover the news that I meant to on eyeshadow

1901
01:51:58,976 --> 01:52:02,560
Talking about his ex-wife

1902
01:52:05,120 --> 01:52:06,144
Sweetie quickly

1903
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:12,544
He just starts rambling about nothing and then is like I was going to talk about the news but then we got to talk about what

1904
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:14,592
The connection is between you and Eternity

1905
01:52:15,872 --> 01:52:18,688
Constant more talking about nothing

1906
01:52:19,456 --> 01:52:22,272
Good just got all sorts of various scattershot

1907
01:52:22,528 --> 01:52:25,088
Bulshit

1908
01:52:25,344 --> 01:52:26,368
How many get to the end

1909
01:52:26,624 --> 01:52:28,416
Towards the end

1910
01:52:29,440 --> 01:52:31,488
There's just a recognition

1911
01:52:32,256 --> 01:52:38,400
I can't do this you can't do it and there's also recognition that I find even more interesting

1912
01:52:39,424 --> 01:52:41,472
Yes yeah if you listen to that clip

1913
01:52:41,728 --> 01:52:43,008
He's not just saying

1914
01:52:43,264 --> 01:52:44,032
I can't

1915
01:52:44,288 --> 01:52:45,312
I can't talk

1916
01:52:45,568 --> 01:52:46,848
I can't do these

1917
01:52:47,104 --> 01:52:49,920
Whatever these things are you saying I don't know why

1918
01:52:50,432 --> 01:52:56,576
Because I don't know why you do it's not true

1919
01:52:56,832 --> 01:53:02,208
Gulf between what he thought he was going to do and what he did now is so vast

1920
01:53:02,720 --> 01:53:04,512
Even he can't talk it away

1921
01:53:05,280 --> 01:53:11,424
Like he realized probably could as a younger man as a younger

1922
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:17,824
Himself in this situation, because if you look back at his website in 2006

1923
01:53:18,848 --> 01:53:19,616
Very different

1924
01:53:19,872 --> 01:53:21,152
Very Far Cry 4

1925
01:53:21,408 --> 01:53:22,944
Show me some it's because

1926
01:53:24,480 --> 01:53:27,808
Going down these Lane

1927
01:53:28,064 --> 01:53:29,344
This is a guy whose business is crap

1928
01:53:29,856 --> 01:53:31,392
Or I mean

1929
01:53:31,904 --> 01:53:32,928
Probably

1930
01:53:34,720 --> 01:53:35,488
Exactly

1931
01:53:36,256 --> 01:53:37,024
So anyway

1932
01:53:37,536 --> 01:53:38,560
Whenever that happens

1933
01:53:39,328 --> 01:53:39,840
Of course

1934
01:53:40,096 --> 01:53:41,376
It becomes externalize

1935
01:53:41,888 --> 01:53:43,680
I receive that here too whenever

1936
01:53:43,936 --> 01:53:46,752
Personal troubles

1937
01:53:47,264 --> 01:53:48,288
I just want more

1938
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:49,312
Just think

1939
01:53:50,336 --> 01:53:51,360
I can get myself right

1940
01:53:52,384 --> 01:53:52,896
Seriously

1941
01:53:53,408 --> 01:53:54,176
I can't watch it

1942
01:53:54,688 --> 01:53:56,224
Vicente the truth

1943
01:53:56,480 --> 01:53:58,016
I think you better get your ass ready

1944
01:53:58,528 --> 01:53:59,296
Got everything else

1945
01:53:59,552 --> 01:54:00,064
Because

1946
01:54:01,600 --> 01:54:03,136
This planet's damn time bomb

1947
01:54:08,768 --> 01:54:09,280
Tomball

1948
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:14,912
And

1949
01:54:18,240 --> 01:54:19,776
It was badass stuff is

1950
01:54:21,824 --> 01:54:23,104
Good for you to just realized

1951
01:54:23,360 --> 01:54:24,128
Relationship

1952
01:54:25,664 --> 01:54:26,176
Me too

1953
01:54:26,688 --> 01:54:27,200
Wolf

1954
01:54:27,712 --> 01:54:28,224
Because

1955
01:54:30,272 --> 01:54:31,040
This whole thing's

1956
01:54:32,064 --> 01:54:32,832
Countdown

1957
01:54:33,344 --> 01:54:35,136
So the end of the world is coming

1958
01:54:35,392 --> 01:54:35,904
Great

1959
01:54:36,160 --> 01:54:39,488
It is over for Humanity and I guess there won't be a Lone Survivor

1960
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,560
So yeah I mean it's just like that's that's just

1961
01:54:42,816 --> 01:54:44,352
Do me a reflection of his

1962
01:54:44,608 --> 01:54:45,632
Mindset

1963
01:54:45,888 --> 01:54:46,656
Why you look very depressed

1964
01:54:47,424 --> 01:54:49,728
Course because of how Alex is a

1965
01:54:49,984 --> 01:54:53,056
Person gets articulated

1966
01:54:53,312 --> 01:54:59,200
It seems to be from all the stories

1967
01:54:59,456 --> 01:55:00,480
Yeah how

1968
01:55:00,736 --> 01:55:01,504
Anything is salt

1969
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:05,600
He's talking about this like great anger that he has with the Devil

1970
01:55:05,856 --> 01:55:07,904
I just wish I could beat up the devil

1971
01:55:08,416 --> 01:55:09,440
Listen I'm not preaching

1972
01:55:09,696 --> 01:55:10,208
When I tell you this

1973
01:55:10,720 --> 01:55:11,232
Me

1974
01:55:11,488 --> 01:55:12,000
Tell him myself

1975
01:55:12,256 --> 01:55:13,024
Zillow Maine

1976
01:55:13,792 --> 01:55:14,560
I want to

1977
01:55:15,328 --> 01:55:15,840
Pizza

1978
01:55:17,376 --> 01:55:18,656
I want to take Lucifer

1979
01:55:19,168 --> 01:55:20,704
Slammed his head in the ground

1980
01:55:23,264 --> 01:55:24,032
It Dylan

1981
01:55:25,568 --> 01:55:27,104
And if Satan can trick you

1982
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:27,872
To try to

1983
01:55:28,384 --> 01:55:29,408
Content with him he win

1984
01:55:30,432 --> 01:55:30,944
You call Jesus

1985
01:55:32,992 --> 01:55:35,808
That's why I call it call and I just apologized for my God

1986
01:55:36,064 --> 01:55:36,576
I got

1987
01:55:36,832 --> 01:55:37,856
I'll show

1988
01:55:38,624 --> 01:55:39,392
Jesus Christ

1989
01:55:39,904 --> 01:55:40,416
Jesus Christ Jesus

1990
01:55:41,952 --> 01:55:43,232
The whole crowd

1991
01:55:43,488 --> 01:55:48,096
Basically is you may not realize

1992
01:55:48,864 --> 01:55:53,216
When you think you're having a great opinion about delay Maxwell you're doing this

1993
01:55:53,472 --> 01:55:55,008
Oh it is Jesus Christ

1994
01:55:55,264 --> 01:55:57,312
Most of the time

1995
01:55:57,568 --> 01:55:59,360
Bizarre Meandering evangelism

1996
01:55:59,616 --> 01:56:01,408
So congratulations

1997
01:56:01,664 --> 01:56:02,176
I think you should do

1998
01:56:02,688 --> 01:56:04,224
Which I think is trash but whatever

1999
01:56:04,480 --> 01:56:04,992
It is trash

2000
01:56:05,248 --> 01:56:10,880
In this dark moment is recognizing like

2001
01:56:11,136 --> 01:56:14,464
I did not do what I set out to do which was

2002
01:56:14,720 --> 01:56:16,768
Cover the news on this 2-hour

2003
01:56:17,280 --> 01:56:18,304
Live broadcast

2004
01:56:18,816 --> 01:56:20,096
So I got 100 articles

2005
01:56:20,352 --> 01:56:21,888
You know I was so mad at myself

2006
01:56:24,448 --> 01:56:25,216
When I got off the air

2007
01:56:26,752 --> 01:56:27,520
Everett was

2008
01:56:27,776 --> 01:56:29,056
Madden cover.

2009
01:56:29,824 --> 01:56:32,896
I said the crew hey we come in when you do 2 hours with me

2010
01:56:33,152 --> 01:56:34,176
79

2011
01:56:34,944 --> 01:56:36,224
I'm going to cover it all

2012
01:56:36,480 --> 01:56:37,504
I'm going to fix it

2013
01:56:41,088 --> 01:56:42,112
And I came in here

2014
01:56:44,416 --> 01:56:44,928
Shut the bed

2015
01:56:45,440 --> 01:56:46,208
I can't text it

2016
01:56:46,976 --> 01:56:47,744
Can't fix it

2017
01:56:48,256 --> 01:56:48,768
Wow

2018
01:56:52,352 --> 01:56:53,376
Only God can fix it

2019
01:56:55,936 --> 01:56:57,216
That's what it really comes down to

2020
01:57:08,480 --> 01:57:09,248
Here's probably was

2021
01:57:10,528 --> 01:57:12,064
News articles

2022
01:57:12,576 --> 01:57:13,088
Refuse

2023
01:57:13,344 --> 01:57:13,856
Broadcast

2024
01:57:14,112 --> 01:57:14,624
Gloves

2025
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:15,904
1st Avenue

2026
01:57:17,696 --> 01:57:20,256
Here's the thing that I think is is fascinating

2027
01:57:20,512 --> 01:57:21,280
He's not fake

2028
01:57:21,536 --> 01:57:22,048
Crying

2029
01:57:22,304 --> 01:57:27,168
No there isn't like a fake over amplification of these things that he's expressing

2030
01:57:30,496 --> 01:57:31,520
Is him saying

2031
01:57:32,032 --> 01:57:36,896
I was really mad at myself when I ended my show so I told the crew come on in

2032
01:57:37,152 --> 01:57:38,176
I'm going to fix it

2033
01:57:38,944 --> 01:57:40,224
I'm going to fix it

2034
01:57:40,480 --> 01:57:44,064
Is such an interesting thing because that's exactly what

2035
01:57:44,576 --> 01:57:47,392
I thought was his intention when I saw

2036
01:57:47,648 --> 01:57:48,160
Show

2037
01:57:48,416 --> 01:57:54,560
You f***** up this is supposed to be a big day for you Yep this is supposed to be like if your new 911 day or what

2038
01:57:54,816 --> 01:57:58,656
You f***** up you need to fix it that is what his intention was

2039
01:57:58,912 --> 01:58:01,216
I'm not making that up he said it

2040
01:58:01,984 --> 01:58:05,568
Fix this

2041
01:58:06,080 --> 01:58:06,848
And I can't fix

2042
01:58:07,616 --> 01:58:08,640
No one can fix it

2043
01:58:10,688 --> 01:58:11,200
It's dark

2044
01:58:11,456 --> 01:58:13,760
That is dark

2045
01:58:14,016 --> 01:58:14,784
That is dark

2046
01:58:16,320 --> 01:58:17,344
Really really funny

2047
01:58:17,600 --> 01:58:20,416
It's really funny

2048
01:58:20,672 --> 01:58:23,232
Is this was a real

2049
01:58:23,744 --> 01:58:26,304
Someone who used to care about that

2050
01:58:26,560 --> 01:58:28,096
Tragedy

2051
01:58:28,352 --> 01:58:29,888
Yeah this is

2052
01:58:32,704 --> 01:58:36,800
Disease similar stories played out in like fiction of like

2053
01:58:37,056 --> 01:58:43,200
People who have lost their step or whatever you're not like you're in over your head

2054
01:58:43,456 --> 01:58:49,600
You know like this is this is something that you may be used to be able to do

2055
01:58:50,112 --> 01:58:52,416
You're capable of that you're no longer capable of

2056
01:58:52,672 --> 01:58:58,048
You just like you have that moment out onstage with your bomb and when you you think you should be killing or

2057
01:58:58,304 --> 01:59:00,864
You're losing a game when you should

2058
01:59:01,120 --> 01:59:02,912
In your Prime you could have handled it

2059
01:59:03,424 --> 01:59:07,264
They are but because

2060
01:59:07,520 --> 01:59:12,896
Whatever it seems like the answers to all of his questions

2061
01:59:13,408 --> 01:59:15,456
Are you could really just come to him

2062
01:59:15,968 --> 01:59:17,504
If you got off the air

2063
01:59:18,016 --> 01:59:20,320
Went home and just looked in the mirror and was just like

2064
01:59:20,576 --> 01:59:22,624
People don't like me because I'm the dick

2065
01:59:22,880 --> 01:59:23,648
Not them

2066
01:59:24,416 --> 01:59:30,560
So like I said I mean I can't stress this enough I was mad at myself and I was going to

2067
01:59:31,072 --> 01:59:32,352
Fix-It are just

2068
01:59:32,608 --> 01:59:33,376
Such

2069
01:59:34,144 --> 01:59:35,680
Weird expressions

2070
01:59:35,936 --> 01:59:36,960
Of what he's doing

2071
01:59:37,984 --> 01:59:40,544
And this supposed to be 2 hours

2072
01:59:40,800 --> 01:59:44,128
He fails he fails in an hour and a half

2073
01:59:44,384 --> 01:59:45,920
20 last 30 minutes Air Tonight

2074
01:59:47,200 --> 01:59:49,504
Leech bite reports the Lord willing I'll be back tomorrow

2075

2076

Thank you I really

2078
01:59:56,928 --> 01:59:57,696

Love yourz

2080
02:00:01,536 --> 02:00:04,096
He leaves half an hour early

2081
02:00:05,888 --> 02:00:09,728
I just think it said it said whether he's drunk or not

2082
02:00:09,984 --> 02:00:11,520
Suspicion that he's drunk but like

2083
02:00:11,776 --> 02:00:15,872
Whether or not he is that's just a disgraceful kind of showing

2084
02:00:16,128 --> 02:00:17,152
And it's just

2085
02:00:17,408 --> 02:00:18,432
It's a bummer like

2086
02:00:19,200 --> 02:00:24,832
Number of failings are Stacker

2087
02:00:25,856 --> 02:00:29,696
You failed to sell anything that was part of his agenda

2088
02:00:29,952 --> 02:00:33,536
He failed to make it the entire two hours

2089
02:00:35,840 --> 02:00:37,376
He failed to keep his head about him

2090
02:00:37,888 --> 02:00:39,168
Couldn't even focus on any

2091
02:00:40,704 --> 02:00:44,800
Failed to even really talk about the only story that he was there for

2092
02:00:45,312 --> 02:00:45,824
God

2093
02:00:46,080 --> 02:00:47,104
Can you imagine

2094
02:00:47,360 --> 02:00:51,456
Can you imagine being like robbed or Daria or something like that

2095
02:00:51,712 --> 02:00:53,760
And you get the call like hey

2096
02:00:54,016 --> 02:00:55,296
Coming in at 7

2097
02:00:55,552 --> 02:00:57,088
And for that breed

2098
02:00:57,344 --> 02:00:58,624
For that brief

2099
02:00:58,880 --> 02:01:00,928
Oh man maybe this is the old Alec

2100
02:01:01,184 --> 02:01:02,976
He's just been through nothing

2101
02:01:03,232 --> 02:01:04,512
And this time he's self

2102
02:01:04,768 --> 02:01:06,560
He's the one inspiring

2103
02:01:06,816 --> 02:01:12,960
Self to go do something he's got the juice this is when he's going to bring it for the first time in years

2104
02:01:13,216 --> 02:01:17,312
He's been in his office cogitating like

2105
02:01:17,568 --> 02:01:19,616
Americans out of the office

2106
02:01:19,872 --> 02:01:20,640
