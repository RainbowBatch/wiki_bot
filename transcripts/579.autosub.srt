1
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for knowledge by now I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

2
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:39,936
MoneyGram

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,136
Dot-com

5
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:06,560
Jones

6
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:07,584
Indeed we are

7
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:10,400
What's up

8
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:12,704
My bright spot today is Monday

9
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,544
The conservation journey of the tributes to Celine

10
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:21,664
So so far and

11
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,456
A baby elephant

12
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,040
Oh and today I am thrilled to announce that

13
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:28,064
Got in touch

14
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,600
And has

15
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:36,000
Protected for M2 of forest area in Belgium

16
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:39,584
In honor of Celine

17
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,912
Do we need to be we need to overtake Rogan

18
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:44,960
And we need to carve out

19
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:47,776
Part of the world for just the walks

20
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:51,616
I think that you're getting into unhealthy

21
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:55,712
Call T territory a little

22
00:01:55,968 --> 00:02:02,112
I think it's more amusing that this is turning out to be like people are just going to take the ball and running with it in the direct

23
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:03,392
Directions that they come up with

24
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:06,720
Some really cool conservation tape ideas

25
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,024
A supporting

26
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:13,120
Call charitability

27
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,424
I really think that's cool

28
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,984
I think so thank you so much

29
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,752
Celine

30
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:19,520
She says

31
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:20,288
Meow

32
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:26,944
What's abortion for the altar of saline and now we have

33
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,712
Adopted

34
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:29,248
People out yeah I know this

35
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:33,344
Wildlife

36
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,624
Corkcicle

37
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,416
Just donating to

38
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:38,976
Preserve wildlife

39
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:42,816
At no point in time has anybody sacrifice

40
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:52,032
What's up my bright spot Dan is early in Layton June I think released his

41
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,616
Documentary stand up special

42
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:59,968
Tastic it is so what he did was he

43
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:01,248
Did six nights

44
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:03,040
Improvised stand-up

45
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:05,344
At this at this

46
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,112
Kind of like

47
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:10,208
Dilapidated / amazing incredible holy Comedy Club

48
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:14,304
And it's fantastic not just because it's really really

49
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:16,608
I mean he's very funny onstage obviously

50
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,376
Scuffles

51
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,400
Really really great

52
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,960
But because it shows him analyzing his sets

53
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:21,728
The afterwards

54
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,752
Like you

55
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:24,288
Committing to

56
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,568
Doing an improvised hour

57
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:26,592
Are you now

58
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:27,360
The comic

59
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:30,944
You know if you're doing that there's a good chance you're going to get at 5

60
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,224
10-minute stretch of like

61
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:34,272
Oh this is nothing

62
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:36,320
Yeah this is nothing so there's that

63
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:41,696
Fear of 20 minutes

64
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:43,232
There's that double-sided

65
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,512
Did fear for him of like

66
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:47,328
I don't want to go into a joke

67
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,864
But that's what

68
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,912
Comics have always trained themselves

69
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:51,680
To do Drew

70
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:54,752
You're ripping 45 minutes you the rift runs out your like

71
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,616
If things are going bad the way you save yourself would be like well I got to pull out of jail

72
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:06,016
Or or you know that kind of thing and so it was that constant fight and then the way that he analyzed it afterwards

73
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:12,416
Like why is it always it why is it getting sexual too soon and he's like well because I've never done this before it's just like when you

74
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,184
You start out

75
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,536
As a comic it starts out real blue and do nothing

76
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:21,119
Psychological deconstruct

77
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,143
By way of

78
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:28,543
Analyzing your own stand-up sets of your own Tendencies under pressure

79
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,591
I would

80
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:31,615
I would recommend it

81
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:34,175
And also there's the story of the comedy club and its

82
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,199
This guy is

83
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,223
The story is amazing

84
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:44,415
I'm so done today we have an episode from the past

85
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:47,487
We're going back to the past I was sick of the bulshit

86
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:48,255
Here's what happen

87
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,303
On Friday we will have

88
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:54,143
A present day episode will talk about f****** Mike Lindell and all this nonsense

89
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,679
But ice

90
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:58,239
Got to a point where I was sitting here I was like

91
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,263
Alright

92
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,311
No matter what

93
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:03,615
If you get into if you at

94
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:06,175
You open up an episode of Alex Jones Show

95
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,455
You're going to find something

96
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:09,759
You're right you're going there's going to be something

97
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:10,527
To talk about

98
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:14,623
What is it going to be like something bizarre like maybe

99
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:19,231
A new species of animal or is it going to be a body

100
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,255
Right

101
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:26,655
There's a cornucopia of possibilities yes that is one thing that's an advantage of present-day it's always upsetting

102
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:31,007
Max is going to be a bummer

103
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,287
Turn up that cover and see

104
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:35,103
I found myself resisting doing it where is

105
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:37,407
In the past year you might find a new fossil

106
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,711
You do something you might add to the

107
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:42,271
I don't know I don't know if his metaphors making any sense but

108
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,807
The point is I I didn't

109
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:49,439
What I wanted to put off someone's birthday

110
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:54,303
That's what they're for us in the past was here in the present is just everybody's going to die

111
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,327
Yes yes

112
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,095
Yeah

113
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:58,143
So today we're going over

114
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:58,911
May 30th

115
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:05,567
2003 before we do let's take a little love and say hello.

116

00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,191
Season 9

127
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,727
Is when the Pelican makes

128

The case on Survivor

132

00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:52,415

I'm a policy wonk

139
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,479
Where's the best co-worker I started buying pills and trips from Alex on becoming a technical text

140
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,503
To bring balance

141
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,295
Thank you so much

142
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,583
Money off that heroin

143
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,191
Freakishly large

144
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:42,847
Started buying fails and there's a myelogram pick up Annika developing Advanced nurse

145

All right and also for helping us out with this special project

149
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,951
We have a new Raptor princess

00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:58,975
Joanna

151
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,119
Barbecue your ass

152
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,655
It's over for Humanity

153
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07,423
You're Beautiful song

154
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:08,959
They're coming for your balls

155
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,519
It's all over your God

156
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,567
Very few people

157
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:14,847
Their babies

158
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,663
Make it a practice

159
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,431
Calling people

160
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:19,967
The garbage when they are

161
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:21,503
Hey Jude

162
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,135
What's the weather

163
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:27,903
From now on

164
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:31,487
Episode

165
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:33,535
Interesting little glimpse

166
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:37,119
Into where I was at the end of May

167
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:37,887
Obviously

168
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,935
Still looking to see

169
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:46,335
If he believes he's fighting the devil 1003 true still trying to see his relationship with the

170
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,871
Iraq War

171
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,407
This Thread that we didn't expect

172
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:52,223
Find where he's in denial about the application

173
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:53,503
Yeah

174
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:57,087
I'm fascinated to see how this plays out and there's midget

175
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:57,855
Pink stuff

176
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:58,623
In the mix

177
00:08:59,135 --> 00:08:59,647
For today

178
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:00,927
But the lead story

179
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,719
Holyshit

180
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,999
Bill Clinton coming back

181
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,775
But Republicans

182
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:22,431
George

183
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,479
Run again

184
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,783
For those in our audience outside the United States

185
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,831
It's the 22nd amendment was added to the Constitution

186
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,623
The douching in 1947

187
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,391
Essentially

188
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:34,975
To make sure that someone could only serve two four-year terms as president

189
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:41,887
This is just kind of understood that this was the norm with George Washington setting an Unwritten precedent by not seeing the third terminal

190
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:47,519
This man was ratified when it was in 1947 because the presidency of Franklin Roosevelt

191
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,287
Route to just end it

192
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:51,103
Who served three terms and it won a fourth election for

193
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,639
For the presidency but died in office

194
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:58,015
People kind of realize at that point that this Norm that everyone just assumed everyone would accept was

195
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,807
Was not actually a rule that maybe we should

196
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:00,831
Put it on paper

197
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,367
Propeller

198
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:06,975
It's more of those things lately, down Roosevelt Amendment

199
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,511
That was the first name of it yeah

200
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:13,631
Presidential been bound by these term limits also the wording of the rules is often caused some

201
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:14,655
Debates pop-up

202
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:21,311
For instance conversations often happen about whether a two-term president could run for a third consecutive term if they were

203
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:27,711
President on the third term

204
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:31,039
Who serve two consecutive terms to run again at a later date

205
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:33,855
Essentially making the term limits only apply to the

206
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:34,623
Consecutive

207
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,391
Sure

208
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:37,183
He was giving speech at the

209
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,463
Probably not a coincidence

210
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:41,791
John F Kennedy Library and Museum in Boston

211
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:45,119
Speculated that given the people were living longer quote

212
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:48,959
There may come a time when we elected president at age 45 or 50

213
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:52,799
And then 20 years later the country comes up against the same kind of problems the

214
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:53,567
Then face before

215
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:56,127
So that's basically you know

216
00:10:57,151 --> 00:11:00,735
Look at the John F Kennedy Library

217
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,295
According to the article

218
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,087
Is Beto's in the BBC quote

219
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,623
The former president said such a change

220
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,183
Probably would not apply to him but would benefit

221
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,207
Future Generations

222
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,535
The kernel of this is yours

223
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:18,655
Berkshire in 2003 representative Serrano introduced to house joint resolution

224
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,423
11

225
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,727
What does repealing term limits for the president

226
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:28,639
He did this literally every other January from 1997 to 2013 and ever

227
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:30,687
Free Bill died in committee

228
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:37,087
Between these years of 1995 and 2005 representative steny Hoyer also introduced bills to repeal the 20th

229
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:37,855
Second Amendment

230
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:39,391
And both of these dudes did this

231
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:42,207
Regardless of which party held the presidency

232
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,999
Like people

233
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:49,375
Are doing this in order to get their guy more turds right they're doing it because they don't believe it should

234
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:52,191
Return limits for the president

235
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:57,567
Is there doing it even if it does bite them in the ass Reagan gets a third term

236
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:58,591
Yeah yeah

237
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:01,151
So the prospect of a l unilaterally

238
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,175
Declaring they want us

239
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,199
Establish term limits

240
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,223
Do not apply to them

241
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:06,271
Maybe be seen as a warning

242
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:09,599
Anxiety but for Alex to report this news about the appropriate context

243
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,647
I think is a bit of a lying by omission

244
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:13,183
Yeah

245
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:17,535
Yeah specially when we live in the present and you just heard everybody being like

246
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:24,191
I don't think there's anything wrong with y'all getting the third term he didn't even get a full one his first sermon you like I don't even have whatever that

247
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,543
Going around with serious dates

248
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,103
Nubian presidency forever

249
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:33,151
And also that argument

250
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,943
From Clinton is really really stupid

251
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:41,343
Really stupid because if you're saying to me that twenty years after a president we find ourselves in the same problems

252
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:44,159
The president was a shity president

253
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:48,511
Maybe maybe there are problems you can deal with

254
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:51,839
But you can't deal with permanent like

255
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:52,607
Recur

256
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,631
I would say in

257
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,679
Relation to Clinton's argument

258
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,727
That is

259
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,007
B were the case

260
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:02,079
President was particularly good

261
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:06,175
Add dealing with something years later the same as you popped up

262
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:08,735
There's a really good chance we would have studied their response

263
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:12,831
To the issue probably and maybe somebody else could Implement a lot of the same

264
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:13,599
Things

265
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:16,159
You wouldn't need the exact same person

266
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,695
To deal with it it's not like

267
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:24,095
They have a magical individual power to

268
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,655
Maybe not

269
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,935
The most compelling

270
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:30,751
Although I do see that some people

271
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,799
Who are opposed to

272
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,591
Term limits don't have

273
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:38,943
The worst ideas ever has valid argument to be made for and against

274
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,503
Yeah I'm not saying that

275
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,551
I think what's funny about saying it at the kennel

276
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:49,183
CityCenter is just like she could also be like and your entire family should run the country forever

277
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:51,231
Why do people problem

278
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:53,023
So Alex has he studied

279
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:53,791
Prediction

280
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:57,119
Haha and I want to say this like this is this is why I going back

281
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,143
What's the password

282
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,167
It's particularly fun

283
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:04,543
Because there's so much going on now with Alex trying to be like I've always been right

284
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:09,663
I predicted everything down so many people online to argue about

285
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:15,295
It turns out I was right bro but I got to tell you Alec

286
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,343
When's you been wrong

287
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:21,439
Every time he shows up they only talk about the times when he's right

288
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,743
About

289
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,023
This is hilarious

290
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,543
Secretary-general

291
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:03,935
Predictions of these are s*** they worked out exactly any more wrong about any of

292
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:10,591
Hillary lost in the 2008 primary to Obama and Bill Clinton is not nor has he ever been the secretary

293
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,871
Terry general of the UN

294
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:16,991
Also there aren't established 8-year terms for un secretary-general

295
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,271
Their terms last

296
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,039
Varying amount

297
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,063
The time over history

298
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:20,831
But

299
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:24,415
Since 1971 has become tradition that a persons elected to the position

300
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,439
For five-year term

301
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:28,511
And they will get a second term unless it's vetoed

302
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:29,535
Buy a member Nation

303
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,327
This is only happened once

304
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:34,399
Boutros boutros-ghali not getting a second term

305
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,679
In 1996

306
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:40,799
The next to secretary-general Kofi Annan and ban ki-moon serve full 10-year stretches

307
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:41,823
In office

308
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:47,711
For someone who's big villain in the world as the UN Alex seems to not have a very good grasp on how they operate

309
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:48,991
No clips

310
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:52,063
Years of study to bring this analysis

311
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:54,623
What's also also just on its face

312
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:57,183
Can you imagine the United Nations

313
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:01,791
Electing a former United States President as the secretary-general

314
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:06,143
Talk about just how unrealistic that is a little bit later but unrealistic

315
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:12,799
I would be very comfortable with saying that we will never see the day ever that not only

316
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,079
Former president

317
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:17,151
But a high-level us Diplomat will never be

318
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:23,551
Be Secretary General of the UN

319
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:30,207
There is a lot of distributed power among the security Council

320
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:32,511
And such a totally organization that you and B

321
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:36,095
There's there's really something important about

322
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,375
The representation

323
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:40,191
That is given by having different regions of the world

324
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:44,799
Represented by the secretary-general absolutely and so whenever there is

325
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,079
New

326
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,615
Appointment coming up

327
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,895
They'll generally be

328
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:51,199
Conversation of what region of the world is

329
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:52,479
Resistire

330
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,271
State belong

331
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:56,063
A group that has had a lot of time

332
00:16:56,319 --> 00:17:01,951
Being up the number of terms in the secretary-general's at Petro

333
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:05,279
First of all you're not going to probably see anybody

334
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,815
From the United States

335
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:12,191
Express whatever second before there's not another

336
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:18,591
Person probably from an Asian country from Eastern Europe has never been someone from the East

337
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,871
Eastern European region

338
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:22,175
Who is Ben in the secretary-general.

339
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,735
These things are important

340
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:27,039
832 the countries

341
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,831
But do have those veto powers

342
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:31,135
Over the process

343
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:35,999
I know somebody in hungry who's really looking for that secretary-general job

344
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:43,679
Just ridiculous if you have any awareness at all and I like I said we'll talk about it in more detail later but like

345
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:46,239
You have any idea about how any of this stuff works

346
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,263
Like this on a

347
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,287
Structural basis

348
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,311
You couldn't

349
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,335
Possibly think the

350
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,103
Hippies were

351
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:53,151
Anyway reasonable

352
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:56,991
Conspiracies to have absolutely not just no way they could ever happen

353
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:58,015
Know some of them

354
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:01,087
It's some of the member nations of the UN I have been like

355
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:04,159
We just had the United States invade us

356
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:07,999
We can't be having them run the UN

357
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:09,279
Yeah

358
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:12,095
Again

359
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:12,863
Really

360
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:16,447
Why does will never happen will get through a little bit down the road

361
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:20,543
You'll notice that these predictions no matter how bad they are and how wrong they

362
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,591
Continue to be they often don't change

363
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:29,247
Hey more recent days we've heard Alex try to reuse this exact same conspiracy but with Michelle Obama becoming president

364
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:31,807
Barack becoming the Secretary General of the UN

365
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,367
It's overloaded s*** but it's really effective

366
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:36,415
In terms of terrifying the audience

367
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:39,487
The Alex can constantly just recycle this stuff with just

368
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:41,279
Slightly different details

369
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:43,071
Change to suit the times

370
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,351
It's all

371
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:45,887
Bulshit

372
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:51,007
If the president of the United States

373
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:55,615
And a former president United States was a un secretary-general at the

374
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:56,639
The same time

375
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:59,199
I think I might believe in the global

376
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:01,247
You know what I'm saying

377
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:05,087
If the president was married to the

378
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:09,183
Secretary General of the UN and this they also happened to be a former president

379
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:13,791
Even if it isn't a conspiracy

380
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:15,327
Just now

381
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:21,727
Whatever's going on is wrong there is it there is a structural problem with the organization of what's going on and we cannot

382
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:28,127
Hey Robert you been doing a great job

383
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:33,503
I need you to do a SG job at the UN even us would be like look

384
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,295
No more Brothers in politics

385
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,575
Sure

386
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:39,135
Eclipse

387
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,927
Save people who I have

388
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:43,231
Mostly positive feelings

389
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:46,303
Barack Obama and Michelle Obama

390
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,607
Dude about their prospects

391
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:49,631
Pretty flexible

392
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:51,935
Honestly laughable just

393
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:52,703
Pavestone

394
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:56,799
What things would need to happen in order to get to that point

395
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:58,335
It's just ridiculous

396
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:00,127
Both China and Russia agree

397
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:03,967
Clinton will be the next secretary chair

398
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:06,527
It's important

399
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:07,551
To understand

400
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:10,111
When you're talking about something that is this

401
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,391
Conspiracy bike

402
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:12,671
Clinton's going to

403
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:14,463
Become the Secretary General of the UN

404
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:15,743
Kind of

405
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:20,095
Have to discuss how one becomes the Secretary General of the UN

406
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:26,751
Or at least you have to give me some kind of an item that you understand that or else I'm going to say that this is

407
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:28,031
Bad analysis

408
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:32,383
And that's what Alex himself on that this is real analysis

409
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,407
Listen to this horseshit

410
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:06,431
Brian stelter

411
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,855
You know you can't smile like that unless you're possessed by a commitment

412
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:18,976
Through the false left-right paradigm

413
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:25,376
Flash forward to a little bit earlier in time I'll come back I hate it

414
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:27,424
Can we fight all the time

415
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,240
Everything is fake I don't get bogged down in the

416
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:36,640
Conspiracy theories every shooting didn't happen

417
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:38,688
Call someone

418
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:40,992
Okay whatever

419
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,528
But Alex has a little bit of a

420
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:44,064
Complaints about the bush

421
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:49,184
He claims that he came into

422
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,488
The the 10-year of bush in office

423
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,536
What position effective see what happens

424
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:55,840
He was disappointed immediately

425
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:03,008
And

426
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:33,984
This is so interesting the way that which Alex's

427
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:36,800
Have the consistency in his desire to

428
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:38,848
To see his political enemies prosecuted

429
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:39,872
Yep

430
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:46,272
For crimes that he's imagine they've committed

431
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:51,136
He imagines his enemies committing our ones his allies are committing openly and off

432
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:51,904
Yeah

433
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:52,672
But they're not

434
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:55,232
Another problem

435
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,256
With bush

436
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:59,072
It comes down to the senate election

437
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,864
Okay and 2000

438
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:02,656
100 Bush came into office

439
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,472
This really confused me

440
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:10,336
But I think I figured out what I was talking about but I still am not 100%.

441
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,896
George Bush

442
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:33,376
So they admit it

443
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:44,384
What exactly did they gave them 50 50

444
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,176
Bush gave them a

445
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:46,944
Receipt

446
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,760
Here's the jump ahead to that

447
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:52,320
That was sort of what I was going to explain last

448
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,344
And I think

449
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:55,904
He's getting at is that

450
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:57,952
Bush stop the recount

451
00:23:58,464 --> 00:23:58,976
In Florida

452
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:03,584
And Florida was a previously republican-held

453
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:07,680
Old searight retired

454
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:09,984
The Democrat ended up winning

455
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,264
The election

456
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:18,688
Maybe Alex thinks that if the recount had gone forward right that the Republican would have won the seat

457
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,992
But based on the percentages I don't think that's

458
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:28,672
The Handlery ahead by like 5%

459
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,352
Involved in stopping

460
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:40,704
Yeah I think that that's the only way that I can look back and make sense

461
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,264
Yeah I think that's probably what he's talkin

462
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:46,336
Cuz they gave it yeah it was and he would almost be a problem

463
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:51,968
Hopefully it's like a trade of like something like that I got the president so they got the Senate

464
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,040
Not all senate elections stick out in your memory but

465
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:56,320
2000

466
00:24:56,832 --> 00:25:02,976
That was the election where John Ashcroft lost the Missouri Senate race to Mel Carnahan who it actually die

467
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:04,256
Prior to the election

468
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:10,912
As someone who is in Missouri at the time this was gratifying.

469
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:14,752
And 52,000 senate elections the vote was tied 50

470
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:17,056
50 with the vice president casting the tiebreaker

471
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:17,824
V

472
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:23,712
2001 Jim Jeffords previously a republican decided to go independent and he started

473
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:24,992
Caucus with the Democrats

474
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:30,624
It'll book you would later released Jeffers explained that he began to feel alienated by the GOP

475
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,160
Particularly in their refusal

476
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:36,768
Support and fund the individuals with Disabilities Act which has been a major priority of his

477
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:37,536
Or at least

478
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:38,560
Decades

479
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:39,328
Before this

480
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:43,424
Hurry if you hear from a statement that he released after he decided to switch

481
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:47,520
Increasingly I find myself in disagreement with my party

482
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:51,872
I understand that many people are more conservative than I am and they form the Republican Party

483
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:56,480
Given the changing nature of the national party it's become a struggle for our leaders to deal with me

484
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:58,016
Me and for me to deal with them

485
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:02,624
Indeed the party's electoral success has underscored the dilemma I face within my party

486
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:08,768
In the past without the presidency the various wings of the Republican party in Congress have had some freedom to argue

487
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:10,816
And ultimately to shape the party's agenda

488
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:13,888
The election of President Bush change that dramatically

489
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:17,472
We don't live in a parliamentary system but it's only natural to

490
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:19,264
To expect that people such as myself

491
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:23,104
Who's been honored with positions of leadership with largely support the president's agenda

492
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:24,640
Looking ahead I can

493
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:25,664
Tibor & Morgan

494
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,992
Instances where I will disagree with the president on very fundamental issue

495
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,528
The issues of choice

496
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:32,064
The direction of the Judiciary

497
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,344
Tax and spending decisions

498
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,368
Missile defense

499
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:35,648
Energy and the environment

500
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:37,184
Host of other issues Largent

501
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,488
Small the largest for me is education

502
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,072
Which Loops back to the individuals with Disability Act issues that he

503
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:44,864
I was very passionate

504
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:49,728
You can make an argument that there was like so backroom dealing involved goes duh

505
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:55,872
After he switched parties and gave the Democrats a slight advantage in terms of votes he was given the chairmanship of the Senate environment

506
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:57,152
And Public Works committee

507
00:26:57,408 --> 00:27:02,272
We could also kind of make the argument that this was making up for the chairmanship that he would necessarily lose

508
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,808
When he leaves the Republican Party

509
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:05,856
Frazier said he had held for a long time

510
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:08,416
Yeah yeah I don't know I don't know

511
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:09,184
But that doesn't

512
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,720
Feel stage to me

513
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:12,768
I don't see anyone admitting it

514
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:13,792
And I don't

515
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:16,096
I don't know what was staged

516
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:16,864
About

517
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:19,168
The ending of the recount

518
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:21,984
I don't understand how any of that stagedoor admitted

519
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:27,616
No interesting about losing to you

520
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:28,640
Yeah yeah

521
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:29,920
That's one

522
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:33,504
It's alright it's always fun whenever

523
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,784
We we hate

524
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:38,624
Somebody so much we'd rather have a dead person in their spot

525
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:45,024
One more. About that ultimately none of this matters at all because you remember it like

526
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,560
He died for the 2000 election

527
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:52,192
His wife Jean filled that c for two years then in 2002 there was a special election where she lost it

528
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:52,960
Jim Talent

529
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:54,240
Anderson was under GOP

530
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:55,008
Control once again

531
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:59,616
Jim Jeffords defection was a big deal on paper but ultimately it only mattered for

532
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:00,896
Stretch of months

533
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:03,712
Yeah we are actually in the past by the time I was recording

534
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:04,480
The show

535
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:05,760
Three witches strain

536
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:07,040
Wow

537
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:11,136
What

538
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,952
It's an interesting way of

539
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:18,048
Recasting certain amount of failure guess

540
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:21,888
Look man

541
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:23,424
Any shows

542
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:26,240
Competition

543
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:28,032
How long is it on a substance

544
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:29,568
He doesn't have competition

545
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:30,336
Because they don't have sex

546
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:34,176
Exactly

547
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,368
Moron

548
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:00,288
It didn't happen

549
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:01,056
It didn't happen

550
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:06,944
I almost would rather listen to something that doesn't have substance that something that's

551
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,736
Pretending to have Subs in Chinese

552
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:10,272
Drastically wrong

553
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:13,600
Yeah yeah it would be like

554
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:14,624
Substance

555
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:16,160
And is

556
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:18,976
Convincing you of inaccurate

557
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:21,536
Conclusion I would rather not have a pie

558
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:24,096
Then have a pie that he baked out of

559
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:27,680
You know with no feeling no nothing it's just

560
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:31,008
The paper is a paper plate I would rather not have a pie

561
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:33,312
Then have somebody give me a paper plate

562
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:44,832
Because I'm taking that paper plate that he's trying to give me using it to serve up a nice pie which is our podcast metaphorically

563
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:49,696
I would love that paper plates

564
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:53,024
Manipur has lost

565
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,560
So

566
00:29:54,816 --> 00:30:00,448
Totally going to become secretary-general

567
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:01,984
F****** stupid

568
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,616
In Beaufort

569
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:11,200
You're they're going to have Hillary Clinton or some other

570
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:22,720
What

571
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:31,424
President

572
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,704
Okay

573
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,616
Wawa

574
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,504
For the

575
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:55,232
What

576
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:09,056
In this episode alone it's almost impressive how much of a lack of awareness about the UN Alex seems to be displaying

577
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:15,712
You been wrong about the way the terms work for secretaries General and he's come up with this fun story about Bill Clinton trying to solicit

578
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:17,248
Set votes at office

579
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:20,064
Alex is wrong with those details to though

580
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:23,648
He's at the Clinton needed eight countries and he gotten the approval of six

581
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:24,416
But that's not

582
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:25,184
True

583
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:30,048
ICandy for secretary-general needs to be I have the backing of 9 members of the UN

584
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:32,864
Security Council and not have any Vito's from any of the

585
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:33,888
Permanent members

586
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:35,936
Who are the United States the United Kingdom

587
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:37,216
France Russia and China

588
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:42,080
They're 15 countries on the security Council at any time so you need to have support of nine of them

589
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:43,872
And not be someone who'd be vetoed

590
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:44,896
Bill Clinton

591
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:51,296
Would absolutely be vetoed either by Russia or China and I'm already brought up 1000000% not even a question

592
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:52,320
There is no

593
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:53,344
Pho King way

594
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,904
Ever happen

595
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:58,720
Not

596
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:06,912
Oh yeah it's a Putin say hello to you mister Clinton

597
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:08,960
Way to work with you going forward

598
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:11,008
It's it's it's an honor

599
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:13,312
Thinkable Prospect

600
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:19,712
Russia or China would not veto a former US president as a candidate for the UN secretary-general ship

601
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:20,736
Nonsense

602
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:22,272
What Dick Cheney could get

603
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,064
Probably.

604
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,880
Alex's Basin that a country's thing like you said off the

605
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:31,488
The G8 but that has nothing to do with the UN Security Council is deciding the secretary-general

606
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:37,376
The G8 is a yearly Summit that was held among the group of eight countries until 2014 when they

607
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:39,424
Kick Russia out and change your name back to the group

608
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,192
7

609
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:46,848
France the United States and United Kingdom are all G8 countries that have a permanent spot on the UN Security Council

610
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:48,384
There is a little bit of overlap

611
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,152
They're sure

612
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,712
The Security Council is made up of

613
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:52,992
The five permanent members

614
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:54,016
And 10 rotating

615
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:57,856
Non-permanent member State representing different regions of the world

616
00:32:58,624 --> 00:33:04,256
In 2003 when Bill Clinton would supposedly be trying to lock down these votes for un secretary-general

617
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:05,024
Positions

618
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:09,120
There were two even 6ga countries in the security Council

619
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:14,752
There were the permanent members France the United States the United Kingdom and Russia since then

620
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:15,520
Been kicked out yet

621
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:18,080
And that your germinate was a rotating member

622
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:20,128
Does g a country that was in the spirit account

623
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:22,944
Of the G8 countries that would it be

624
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,224
Didn't even a factor in the

625
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,040
The decision about the selection of the secretary-general

626
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:29,856
Canada Italy and Japan play

627
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:30,880
Who

628
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:35,744
But maybe Alex is talked about in 2006 when the whole thing would go down not 2003 right

629
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,120
Bill Clinton was just trying to plan prematurely preemptively

630
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:42,400
This doesn't work either

631
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:49,056
In 2006 is no longer a rotating member of the security Council so the number is actually

632
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:50,080
The decider

633
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:51,360
The balance out it wouldn't work

634
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:55,968
It's really a big problem how little Alex seem to grasp about this stuff that he's talking

635
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,504
I'm making these grandkid

636
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,528
Conspiracies about

637
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:02,880
He's pulling out numbers and making up fun scary stories for the audience but it's pretty embarrassing

638
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:05,184
When you consider the reality how the UN works

639
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:06,720
Even if

640
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:09,792
A candidate makes it through the selection process in the security Council

641
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:13,888
They still need to be approved by the general assembly afterwards

642
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:20,544
Don't no one has ever been rejected by the general assembly after being selected by the the the security Council

643
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,896
The awareness that certain candidates would be rejected as a critical part of the

644
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:26,432
The security Council selection process

645
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:28,992
And part of light off and ends up dragging on

646
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:29,760
Pretty long

647
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:32,320
There's zero chance

648
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:35,648
That Bill Clinton or any former US president would be

649
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:38,976
Not be voted down by the channel cap assembly

650
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:40,256
Outrageously Snoop

651
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:42,304
I am going to tell you this right now

652
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:44,096
I refuse

653
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:44,864
To take

654
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,656
The predictions of subway

655
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:47,936
Hoop report

656
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:48,704
To be an ex

657
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,496
Expert in international affairs

658
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:55,872
Who would absolutely be destroyed by any ten-year-old in the model un Club

659
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:56,896
Definitely

660
00:34:57,408 --> 00:35:03,552
Murdered by a ten-year-old simple basic ten-year-old would be

661
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:09,952
Disappointed to have that conversation with an adult it would rattle their entire perception of humanity

662
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:11,232
And they would learn too young

663
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,768
Adults are just bigger chill

664
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:19,424
And how is your confidence and you know amass enough false credibility

665
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,472
People will just go along with what you say

666
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:22,240
Like

667
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:23,776
Beat up the notion

668
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:24,800
That

669
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:26,080
Like

670
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:31,968
If you're in the security Council in here discussing like who should we put up for the secretary-general chairs

671
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:32,992
It would be

672
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:34,272
Fairly obvious

673
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:36,832
That it might be seen as insulting

674
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:38,880
The rest of the world

675
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:40,928
To nominate a former US president

676
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:45,024
Would probably be a consideration like it would be in the front

677
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:46,304
Generally speaking

678
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,632
It would give the message that the United States

679
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:51,936
Actual Primacy

680
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:56,800
In the world that is not

681
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:58,080
We are

682
00:35:58,336 --> 00:36:01,920
The body that represents a large number of nations

683
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:04,480
Who all have some sort of tension but

684
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:10,112
Between each other in some form or another so we tend to elect somebody with a neutral perhaps

685
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:12,672
Stephen distance

686
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:15,232
View of how to deal with this on the

687
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:16,256
A global scale

688
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:18,048
Or this time

689
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:23,424
We could elect one of the guys causing all of the tensions all around the world

690
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:25,728
I can't imagine that like

691
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:30,080
Never be like you

692
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:31,616
Let's do this

693
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,152
Yeah yeah

694
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:37,248
Obama has a Peace Prize and we will all want it taken away we don't want him

695
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:38,272
Anywhere near the U

696
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:39,296
Alex

697
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:40,064
Is

698
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:40,832
Able

699
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:42,880
To confidently assert these things

700
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:45,696
Because the space is so stupid

701
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:47,488
Like there

702
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:50,560
Like it at people who are giving voice to the

703
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:53,376
That's not how this works Cher Cher Bono

704
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:57,472
It's Magic his co-host might be a ten-year-old in the model untf

705
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:59,264
Yeah they'll be devastated

706
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:00,800
I'd be awful

707
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:02,848
So Alex goes on a little bit

708
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:36,640
In the in the present Alex is totally fine with a new world order as long as it's a

709
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:40,992
New World Order a collection of

710
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:43,552
Christian nationalist States

711
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:49,952
That all work together International Coalition of nationalist States who refused to view

712
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:56,352
Do International Coalition does being valuable and we're also going to buy Greenland or going to take over

713
00:37:57,376 --> 00:38:00,704
Nationalism colonialism

714
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,264
Two new world order new world order

715
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,544
World Order

716
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,312
New World Order

717
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:09,408
Smith secretaries-general

718
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:11,200
Gaston

719
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:13,504
And this person is barely a member of

720
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:18,112
A school board in Akron Ohio which is where they were having

721
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:19,392
The discussion about the finger

722
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:21,184
Thanks for lunches

723
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,000
One of the large Arguments for is it

724
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:25,280
The bureaucratic nightmare

725
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:27,072
Some sort of an organization

726
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:27,840
The large

727
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:28,864
City School

728
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:32,448
Also there were a number of high number of

729
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:33,472
To Iran

730
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,752
Assistance programs

731
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:36,544
Had to take away the stigma that

732
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,568
That students real

733
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:40,128
Your eye and I reduce bullying

734
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,176
This way you wouldn't have to have a ticket

735
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:44,736
Signal singles you out as

736
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:48,576
Alex wants her to say the boring interview

737
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:50,624
Alex wants her to say that it's

738
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:51,904
Mandated

739
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:56,000
Ride the government the federal government is making them do this

740
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,304
Because it's not

741
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:05,216
Anthony and David the way the fed's Mandate water things by saying

742
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:08,544
You can have this money however you can only

743
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,824
Spend this money

744
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:10,848
In this way

745
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,152
So what they don't tell you exactly

746
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:13,920
What

747
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:15,968
Your limited on what kinds of

748
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:16,736
Scanner

749
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:30,304
Yes they're not mandating it

750
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,072
It's a grant

751
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:33,376
So so it's like okay

752
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:36,448
Okay so it's like somebody's giving you a hundred bucks

753
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:38,496
For you to buy this thing

754
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:39,776
Right

755
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:40,544
They

756
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,312
That you need

757
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:45,152
And you can't just go spend it on drugs

758
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:47,456
Stop

759
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:51,808
Yeah it's the federal government telling me what to do with their money and I hate it

760
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:53,088
Don't some fun trivia

761
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:58,464
What is woman that Alex is interviewing is the mother of Patrick Carney the drummer from The Black Keys

762
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,536
Team Trivia

763
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,608
That is very fun trivia

764
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:11,008
It has legitimately nothing to do with his interview but I was so bored then

765
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:17,408
I was like who is this person can I find out anything about them and it turns out she's The Black Keys drummer mother

766
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:19,456
In the process of looking at that I realized

767
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:22,016
The Black Keys drummer Patrick Carney is married to

768
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:25,344
One of my favorite singer-songwriters Michelle Branch

769
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:29,440
Hippie mother-in-law Michelle

770
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:32,512
It's a Small World

771
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:36,352
Small world everybody has love and will travel

772
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:40,960
So they're talking a little bit more and this is the only other thing I really think was

773
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:43,520
All that interesting and it's I think Alex

774
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:46,080
Thinks me solution to

775
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:47,616
School shootings

776
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:49,152
And what have you is

777
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:51,200
Beating up kids

778
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:58,880
They make me run around

779
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:07,328
And then you have parents that that you know

780
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:09,376
They come in and I think their job is

781
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:10,656
Be there kids stuff

782
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:13,216
The kids best friend and they take the child

783
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:19,616
Hardness a nice to know if parents are ruining their children because they're uncomfortable with being parents

784
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,040
Throw up

785
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:33,184
Ma'am

786
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:35,488
I don't know if I have much

787
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:37,024
A comment for that but it's kind of

788
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:43,168
Sad you know if you don't want bad things to happen you should psychologically and physically torture your kitten

789
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:45,216
I don't know why everybody doesn't get this

790
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:51,616
Yeah you know you physically and psychologically tortured children into behaving good as a do

791
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:57,503
And then later on when they're adults they'll torture children into behaving good as an adult

792
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:58,271
An owl

793
00:41:58,527 --> 00:41:59,295
We have our perfect

794
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:00,063
System

795
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:04,415
Of all of those people can't we see that dude I think that

796
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:05,951
Makes a lot of sense

797
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:07,999
That you should give card blocks

798
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:11,583
Do people who are in an educational capacity

799
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:16,447
To enact violence a stranger

800
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:22,847
To beat my children I want them to determine what is and is not appropriate and then respond with Viber

801
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:23,871
Yep yep

802
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:25,151
Yep I infect

803
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:26,943
You know what as a parent I want

804
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:28,735
Let's say over how my kids are

805
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:31,807
I would also like some of that violence to be tortured

806
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:36,159
Crisco absolutely until you vomit and if you have a paddle

807
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:39,231
You better Innovative way to make it hit harder

808
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:40,511
Cuz if you don't what's

809
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:41,279
The point

810
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:42,047
Yeah

811
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:43,583
I don't like this position

812
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:46,143
Alex ever talking to this gas

813
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:48,191
God the mother of The Black Keys drummer

814
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:49,983
He goes to call

815
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:51,519
I listen to

816
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:53,055
In the evening

817
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:54,335
Here locally in the shop

818
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:55,359
Call Gloria en.

819
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:56,895
There I forgot to tell him

820
00:42:58,943 --> 00:42:59,967
After work this morning I forgot

821
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:00,991
But I know the name of it

822
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:01,759
Video

823
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:03,807
It's called Monopoly man have you ever heard of it

824
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:05,855
What do you think of it

825
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:07,135
That's pretty good

826
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:09,183
I don't I don't think Alex has seen it

827
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:11,487
Sort of response is always

828
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:13,279
Snyder no

829
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:17,631
Monopoly man wasn't an actual documentary it was the title of an episode of it

830
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:19,679
The conspiracy show called The phenomenon

831
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:22,239
The series was hosted by Dean Stockwell

832
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:23,263
This one had to do with

833
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:25,311
The theories surrounding the Federal Reserve

834
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:26,079
Sure

835
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:30,175
Freemasons go back and look at this episode and see who they chose to talk to

836
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:31,711
Here are some of the experts

837
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:32,991
But they consulted

838
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:39,135
Here we go give me give me a call give me a ride or when I didn't see them

839
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:43,743
Andrew Arnold was interviewed who is he an editor for the spotlight

840
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:47,327
Which is that anti-semitic rag published by Willie cardo

841
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:54,495
Hey spotlight

842
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:56,799
Oh they also talked to William still

843
00:43:57,055 --> 00:44:03,199
Whose film The Money Masters contains historical inaccuracies about the Rothschild family

844
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:06,015
Anti-semitic propaganda most notably the Nazi film

845
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:08,063
The Rothschild sharrett Waterloo

846
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:12,159
Clearly this is the kind of hard-hitting TV episode that does their homework

847
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:13,951
Work on the possible crypto beliefs

848
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:16,255
But they're supposed experts might be secretly pushing

849
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:18,815
Woobat job Dean Stockwell

850
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:19,839
Yeah

851
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:22,399
It really bums me out cuz here's what they could just

852
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:23,935
I'm tired of all the Conte

853
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:26,495
Just every couple of weeks

854
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:30,079
Put out another video of somebody Straight Ahead like in Ahoskie

855
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:31,359
Situation just going

856
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:33,919
I haven't used it and then we all got it

857
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:35,455
That's what they all say

858
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:37,759
It's the same documentary a million times over

859
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:39,295
Well they would never do that be

860
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:40,063
Because

861
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:42,367
You can't really persuade people

862
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:43,391
With that you have to

863
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:46,207
Couch your beliefs Indies crypto

864
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:49,279
Talking points is essentially what

865
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:52,095
This documentary about the Federal Reserve

866
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:53,631
You know boils down to

867
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:56,447
And you can try to tell by the guest election that

868
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:58,239
I don't know if the people who are making

869
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:00,031
In this documentary series

870
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:01,823
Hey the vested interest in

871
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:03,871
Really giving the spotlight

872
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:04,895
There

873
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:07,455
An unchallenged position

874
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:10,783
It seems like it was at least

875
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:14,111
Dad

876
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:15,647
Straight up

877
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:20,767
Nazis in here

878
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:21,535
Very silly

879
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:22,815
So Alec

880
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:24,351
Talks to a guy named Frank

881
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:25,119
Adorable

882
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:26,143
Is another gas

883
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:26,911
Alright

884
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:27,935
And

885
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:30,239
Activist

886
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:32,543
2

887
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:35,615
Doesn't seem too bad kind of just seems like

888
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:39,199
You might not know who Alex is entirely right

889
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:40,735
Legends about 911 himself

890
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:41,759
Sure

891
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:44,319
You can see Alex

892
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:46,623
There's a really fascinating thing to happen

893
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:47,647
Concierge

894
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:51,743
Whenever Alex tries to relate to somebody who doesn't actually relate to right

895
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,791
Who was off tracks so fast

896
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:56,607
Calling the paradise

897
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:07,871
Republic

898
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:09,663
During all these Wards as

899
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:10,431
Republican

900
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:18,879
Democrat

901
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:20,415
Can you play some years ago

902
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:27,583
Anything that we do

903
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:29,375
Direct deposit

904
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:41,663
Organized crime

905
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:53,183
Terminology

906
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:25,183
I can't speak for everybody else

907
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:26,463
Yeah that

908
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:27,487
Was weird

909
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:30,047
Huh

910
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:36,191
Longtime activist who made a film called what I've learned about US foreign policy the war against

911
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:36,959
The third world

912
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:38,495
Does released in 2000

913
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:42,079
It's not really an original documentaries and a lot of it is clips

914
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:45,919
Two speeches by Martin Luther King jr. Jimmy Carter and Amy Goodman

915
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:48,479
Minute section

916
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:52,319
It's just clips from a different documentary about the Iran-Contra Affair

917
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:53,087
Course

918
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:56,927
It seems like Frank has a mostly level-headed anti-war fellows

919
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:57,951
I think that he is talking

920
00:47:58,207 --> 00:47:59,487
Into the same sort of person

921
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:01,791
Just like they have a few different political idea

922
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:05,119
What happened there is what I see happening

923
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:07,423
When Alex tries to find this common ground

924
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:09,215
What happens is

925
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:10,751
The common ground is established

926
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:14,079
In the pay believe that the problem of militarism is not unique

927
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:15,359
To the left or the right

928
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:19,711
And then immediately Alex will start ranting about some other bizarre talkin boy that has nothing to

929
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:22,271
To do with what's being discussed like HIV in the corn

930
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:25,343
Who's the complete curveball and it's meant to disorient for

931
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:27,135
Or at least put them in the sort of Defense

932
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:27,903
Some posture

933
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:29,951
Yunnan situation for Alex's drink

934
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:31,487
Rosetta agreement with somebody who's

935
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:32,767
Ostensibly on the left

936
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:34,815
Still needs to assert dominance

937
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:36,863
And honestly it comes off a really weak

938
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:37,887
And confusing

939
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:39,935
Yeah and there's always the moment

940
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:42,495
Where the person

941
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:44,543
Did you know that

942
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:48,383
Is when he just went oh no

943
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:49,407
Iron Man

944
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:50,687
With a Bluetooth

945
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:53,503
Or maybe at least

946
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:54,783
You start to get worried about it

947
00:48:55,551 --> 00:49:00,415
Alex backs off on that a little bit maybe just

948
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:02,975
So talk about Warsaw Cannon

949
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:04,255
Sure

950
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:05,791
I'm so Alex

951
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:08,351
Centerview and

952
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:10,911
Concerned about Bordertown

953
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:12,447
No

954
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:17,567
Junior High School

955
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:43,935
So

956
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:47,263
There's a couple issues here

957
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:52,895
Activists and all the sudden he's like

958
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:56,735
You know kids are being sacrificed to the satanic cult sound what do you think about that

959
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:57,503
I think I

960
00:49:57,759 --> 00:49:58,527
Took the round looking

961
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:06,207
Idea about a literal devil

962
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:09,791
It still doesn't help to be misdirect

963
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:13,119
Exactly could be worshipping a God that doesn't

964
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:13,887
Exist

965
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:17,215
A Alex in the present-day we know he believes

966
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:17,983
Hook

967
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:25,407
Pitchfork literal corn

968
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:29,247
Getting into people's heads and making them

969
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:30,271
Morph into

970
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:36,671
Places to go black

971
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:38,463
This still is like

972
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:40,511
I could see somebody being like

973
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:44,607
Fight in the street and I don't believe what they believe

974
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:45,375
Alright

975
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:47,167
Look what they're doing right

976
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:48,703
You can still have that

977
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:52,799
Though and there's tons of people still on the on the right who do Rekha

978
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:53,567
Acknowledge that the

979
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:54,335
The Church of Satan

980
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:56,127
Aiden is not actually worshipping

981
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:57,663
Their literal Christian

982
00:50:57,919 --> 00:50:59,967
Disagree with that

983
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:02,527
This doesn't do it for me in terms of that

984
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:03,551
Open question

985
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:06,623
Now I will say that I've been to Juarez

986
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:08,415
And I did not get sacrifice

987
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:10,207
Not once

988
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:11,487
Not even one time

989
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:13,535
No

990
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:15,327
Now

991
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:17,887
How can I get some of that

992
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:18,655
Corn

993
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:21,471
Oh no are you okay

994
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:23,007
Street vendor at some corn

995
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:29,919
Spice on it real good little Mexican street corn

996
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:31,967
I don't know

997
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:34,015
Sacrifice to the devil

998
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:34,783
Damn

999
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:38,367
Alex has been wrong about number of things

1000
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:39,135
And

1001
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:40,159
He continues

1002
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:41,695
To be wrong about something

1003
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:43,487
Other we mentioned earlier

1004
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:47,071
Is a ongoing theme

1005
00:51:59,103 --> 00:52:00,383
So Alex is

1006
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:02,175
Still as of May 30th

1007
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:07,807
I convinced that the bath party is being put in power no change in that status quo

1008
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:09,087
He is still

1009
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:09,855
You still

1010
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:13,439
Looking to make that picture I don't know if he's even look into it but it's still

1011
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:16,511
If there's a pivot it's in the future

1012
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:18,815
Yeah

1013
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:19,839
How are you

1014
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:22,911
That's a weird thing to that the weird Hill to die on

1015
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:23,679
You know like

1016
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:28,543
Because you don't have any vested into there's no but there's no real part of the

1017
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:31,615
Conspiracy that requires them to put the bad party in there

1018
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:34,943
You could just say that the CIA took over the other people

1019
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:36,479
Cuz they were all CIA

1020
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:41,343
I imagine that might be the direct Migos eventually

1021
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:43,135
Fight Against the Grain on that one

1022
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:45,439
Like the idea of still having

1023
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:49,023
Conspiracy it seemed salvageable because you can just say

1024
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:50,303
This person also

1025
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:51,327
CIA

1026
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:56,447
But this this abject denial of something that is going on is a major issue is

1027
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:57,727
Strength

1028
00:52:57,983 --> 00:53:00,543
Any idea that you your audience is going

1029
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:03,871
To have a an interesting

1030
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:08,223
The view of the differences between Sunni and Shiite is maybe a little silly

1031
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:13,087
There's one thing that you can't into generally

1032
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:14,623
It's not

1033
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:16,927
Quite quite applies to the bath

1034
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:18,463
Party narrative

1035
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:22,047
But in terms of Saddam if you look at the way Alex's discussing

1036
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:22,815
Situation here

1037
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:24,351
These later perfect track

1038
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:26,655
In front of him we're like no matter what happens

1039
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:28,191
Try and pretend he's right

1040
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:29,983
I also know

1041
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:32,287
Where are you at

1042
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:48,671
What they will

1043
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:57,119
So now we have multiple situations

1044
00:53:57,375 --> 00:54:03,519
Where we find Saddam or we don't write if we don't Alex's right there never would find him and if they do find him then

1045
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:04,799
Mr. Bullard

1046
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:08,127
So you've created a situation no matter what

1047
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:09,407
Do you have track

1048
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:10,431
Week

1049
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:11,711
To be ripe

1050
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:13,503
It's very lazy strata

1051
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:16,319
I think the only one that you really

1052
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:18,111
Probably couldn't f*** with you

1053
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:19,135
Just yet is that

1054
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:24,255
Saddam actually died 1994 it's been one of his novels.

1055
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:29,119
Well I don't know how big a part of the show Steve is in 2003

1056
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:31,423
So that narrative has not been brought up yet

1057
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:32,703
So Alex

1058
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:38,079
Has a story here it's about how there's a death camps being announced in America

1059
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:39,615
McKay's

1060
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:44,735
She's going back to a headline from three talk about a previous episode where there was discussion about the

1061
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:49,087
Possibility of military tribunals that would lead to executions of prisoners

1062
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:51,135
Animo

1063
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:55,743
Relating that and turning it into a thing where it's like well

1064
00:54:56,511 --> 00:54:59,071
That's going to be in Omaha or whatever

1065
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:01,631
And so he's got that

1066
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:03,935
Look how smoothly he turned this into a plug

1067
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:02,559
It's a plug but it's a plug for free publicity

1068
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:08,959
It's a plug for the early days when we when I used to be

1069
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:14,591
Be like oh man I didn't see that plug coming that was back whenever used to be able to to do that

1070
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:19,199
What kind of snack kind of stuck there was a little bit of a natural organic

1071
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:24,831
Whatever from murder to buy pill

1072
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:29,695
At least connective tissue between like

1073
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:32,255
Here is something bad

1074
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:33,535
Here is

1075
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:37,631
My plea that you watch my documentary about something bad

1076
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:39,167
Service

1077
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:41,727
Free advertising for 8 everybody

1078
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:42,751
Tell everybody

1079
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:45,567
Economic sense

1080
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:46,847
But it's still like

1081
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:47,871
Pretty transparent

1082
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:52,479
Egregious a great you know what I like a good I like a good 95

1083
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:56,063
To 120 minute movie that's about as long as they should be

1084
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:57,855
187 minutes

1085
00:56:58,111 --> 00:56:58,879
For that s***

1086
00:56:59,391 --> 00:57:01,695
Froedtert sequel

1087
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:04,511
I like to the way that this is like

1088
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:07,583
Also everything is just the same as ever like

1089
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:08,607
We have this

1090
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:10,399
Un conspiracy wax

1091
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:12,959
It's Bill and Hillary as opposed to Michelle and Barack

1092
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:13,983
We have

1093
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:14,751
This

1094
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:21,919
You know the death camps and what have you and also I'm being shadowbanned on the internet

1095
00:57:22,431 --> 00:57:24,223
You got to send it out there emails

1096
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:26,015
UVM shadowbanned in 2000

1097
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:29,087
Amazing that he was able to like reach the levels of C

1098
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:35,487
Success with people blocking him in 2003

1099
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:42,143
Either there was no way to grow into a massive International fostertown for some sort of contest

1100
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:43,423
Text like at one point

1101
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:44,191
In this

1102
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:45,983
Episode

1103
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:47,775
He's on in 30

1104
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:48,799
States in the car

1105
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:50,591
He's not even on

1106
00:57:50,847 --> 00:57:51,359
In 20

1107
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:53,663
There's just no way to grow a business

1108
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:54,943
This anymore if you're a white man

1109
00:57:55,199 --> 00:58:01,343
Just you can't do it when you're shadowbanned there's a number another thing that never changes everything

1110
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:02,367
Always the same

1111
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:04,671
Nose answer your

1112
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:09,023
The resolution

1113
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:09,791
Resolution

1114
00:58:12,351 --> 00:58:13,119
Memorial Day Parade

1115
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:31,039
You do this all the time in 2009 there's a big initiative

1116
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:31,807
To push the

1117
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:33,855
Yeah Amendment resolutions

1118
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:39,231
Constantly trying to be like hey we still believe in this thing that's the law

1119
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:40,767
Yeah yeah yeah

1120
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:42,047
It's everybody

1121
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:45,887
Everybody's Bound by it it's nice that we've always been hated by monsters

1122
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:46,655
But what

1123
00:58:46,911 --> 00:58:53,055
Especially nice to know is that they're also very very lazy and just say the same things for years

1124
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:56,127
Pretty interesting the way that there are those like

1125
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:57,407
It just

1126
00:58:58,943 --> 00:59:02,271
It's like a band it's like Boston will always Play More Than A Feeling

1127
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:04,063
Without to have to

1128
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:05,599
And Alex will always

1129
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:08,415
Have some of these things that are just like

1130
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:17,631
Just how to beat Center that's a hit it is it is like people listening to the same song on the radio over and over

1131
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:19,935
Over and over again it's just like yeah give me that hate

1132
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:20,703
Give me that

1133
00:59:21,215 --> 00:59:24,031
Jorge

1134
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:26,591
Look at it I can listen to FM

1135
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:27,871
But they don't make me hate

1136
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:28,639
Stuff

1137
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:32,479
You really give me that freedom to want to kill my neighbor

1138
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:35,039
And the other thing to like it's really really

1139
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:36,063
Weird

1140
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:38,367
Notion that he wants to

1141
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:40,671
To constantly be passing resolutions

1142
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:42,463
The affirm the Bill of Rights

1143
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:43,743
Is is

1144
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:44,767
It's Saturday

1145
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:46,303
Trap do duplicit

1146
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:48,351
That's because it's like okay first of all to waste

1147
00:59:48,863 --> 00:59:52,191
You're wasting everybody's time

1148
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:56,287
Just fed up with a like we did this a couple years ago why are we doing this again

1149
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:58,591
You don't like the Bill of Rights Act

1150
00:59:59,103 --> 00:59:59,615
It's just

1151
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:01,407
Such a stupid game

1152
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:02,943
Constantly playing it

1153
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:03,711
Yeah

1154
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:07,807
God's annoying the worst part is even if it doesn't go anywhere the waist

1155
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:09,343
Time is also a win for the

1156
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:12,159
Just wasting our time is a win because it

1157
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:13,183
It's time not spent

1158
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:14,207
I don't know

1159
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:20,607
Improving anything more like hey let's fix roads or something it's just now

1160
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:21,631
We got to spend

1161
01:00:22,143 --> 01:00:24,191
Three days in session saying

1162
01:00:24,447 --> 01:00:28,031
I think the Bill of Rights is good

1163
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:29,823
Smothered

1164
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:30,847
This is a pretty guess

1165
01:00:31,103 --> 01:00:32,127
Field episode

1166
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:34,687
The person named

1167
01:00:34,943 --> 01:00:36,991
Furman who's a Belgian lawyer

1168
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:39,807
And I don't know I think

1169
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:42,623
More or less okay with the

1170
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:44,159
To like you

1171
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:47,999
Alright might have a little bit of a

1172
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:49,023
It's hard to tell

1173
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:53,631
If there is a politeness for an inclination towards conspiracy

1174
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:54,655
Enhance

1175
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:57,215
Kind of tough to tell and I couldn't

1176
01:00:57,727 --> 01:01:00,799
I couldn't quite read it quite read exactly how the dynamic was

1177
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:01,823
But you do you have

1178
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:03,359
We have this person who's

1179
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:05,151
A lawyer in Belgium

1180
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:05,919
Who's

1181
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:07,967
Part of bringing these charges

1182
01:01:08,479 --> 01:01:11,807
Against military US military forces who have shot at civilian

1183
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:13,087
Belgian Court

1184
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:15,903
Order to try and get these

1185
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:16,671
I think

1186
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:17,439
Address

1187
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:21,791
When you have the anti-war activist guy who made a documentary that's just

1188
01:01:22,047 --> 01:01:23,583
Just a bunch of clips of things

1189
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:25,631
I don't f*** I don't totally hate him

1190
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:28,191
The lady from the Akron School Board I think is

1191
01:01:28,447 --> 01:01:29,215
Wrong and

1192
01:01:29,471 --> 01:01:30,751
I think the issue is meaningless

1193
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:32,543
Black Keys are great

1194
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:35,359
She's the mother of one of them

1195
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:38,687
Interesting set of gas

1196
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:42,527
Yeah when nobody knew who he was you could really get a diverse

1197
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:44,575
Series of people that come on your show

1198
01:01:46,111 --> 01:01:46,879
Pretty bizarre

1199
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:53,279
But we we talked about this a little bit because I mentioned on our previous episode that one of the people who is going to be a witness

1200
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:55,071
In this case

1201
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:59,935
In Belgium's was on the show and so now this lawyer is on

1202
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:06,847
17

1203
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:13,503
Amendment of the law

1204
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:15,039
The Belgian government has

1205
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:22,207
Sorry to pass over the file to the US

1206
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:23,743
Which day

1207
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:41,919
Before US military Court

1208
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:43,967
To go into

1209
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:47,039
Committed by

1210
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:48,575
U.s. troops

1211
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:56,255
Good well and I fully support Iraqi civilians having their day in court

1212
01:02:56,511 --> 01:02:57,279
Being given a voice

1213
01:02:58,047 --> 01:03:02,143
I just have a bit of a problem accepting that Alex can credibly have this conversation

1214
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:02,911
Because

1215
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:04,447
I'm not sure what his solution could

1216
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:05,215
Possibly be

1217
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:06,751
This gentleman is

1218
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:09,823
Pretty clearly expressing the problem with expecting countries to hold them

1219
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:12,383
Themselves responsible for the atrocities that they can bid for

1220
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:13,407
Particularly during wartime

1221
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:16,735
Yeah why would they want to do that it would make them do less war

1222
01:03:16,991 --> 01:03:20,831
How could these Iraqi civilians ever get a fair Hearing in the US

1223
01:03:21,087 --> 01:03:22,111
Military Tribunal

1224
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:25,695
This is where having International bodies can really shine

1225
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:31,071
Oz world do is diametrically opposed to any kind of infringement on the sovereignty of the United States

1226
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:35,935
While preserving Hardline version of State sovereignty there's absolutely no Safeguard against

1227
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:36,703
Insterstate Act

1228
01:03:36,959 --> 01:03:37,983
However they want

1229
01:03:38,495 --> 01:03:40,287
Provided they have the might to back up those Acts

1230
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:42,847
Can say like while we just shoot

1231
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:44,127
All you want

1232
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:44,895
Play yeah

1233
01:03:45,151 --> 01:03:46,431
That's not that's not

1234
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:47,967
Like a good

1235
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:50,015
Weight organized

1236
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:50,783
Thanks

1237
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:51,807
No absolutely

1238
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:54,623
Just look at how every

1239
01:03:54,879 --> 01:03:56,927
Self-regulated industry the United States were

1240
01:03:57,695 --> 01:03:58,975
Very unregulated

1241
01:03:59,487 --> 01:04:01,535
Know what it like

1242
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:02,815
Every month

1243
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:05,631
Mysterious or every country that's acting monstrously

1244
01:04:06,399 --> 01:04:06,911
Is not going

1245
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:08,447
To check themselves

1246
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:11,007
Turkey still won't admit to a lot of

1247
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:13,823
I don't think they're going to be like a

1248
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:14,847
Look

1249
01:04:15,103 --> 01:04:16,127
The genocide never happened

1250
01:04:16,383 --> 01:04:18,431
But we will discipline the people

1251
01:04:18,943 --> 01:04:20,223
Definitely didn't commit that Janice

1252
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:24,063
Checks and balances don't work when you're doing all of it you're

1253
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:26,623
Why would you

1254
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:29,439
About this conversation with this guy

1255
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:30,975
Doesn't make sense to me

1256
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:31,999
Because what he

1257
01:04:32,255 --> 01:04:32,767
He saying

1258
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:33,791
Make sense

1259
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:34,815
I

1260
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:36,863
Did you appreciate on some level

1261
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:38,399
Alex's willingness

1262
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:42,239
To have this guy on sure I certainly don't think he's the only person

1263
01:04:42,495 --> 01:04:43,263
Who would be willing

1264
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:44,543
Going to I'm sure people like

1265
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:50,687
Amy Goodman would maybe through be a less stupid conversation

1266
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:54,015
I just don't see I don't see how he

1267
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:55,039
You could possibly

1268
01:04:55,295 --> 01:04:56,831
Have a solution to this problem the Dozen

1269
01:04:57,087 --> 01:04:57,599
Involve

1270
01:04:58,879 --> 01:05:00,159
Amount of

1271
01:05:00,415 --> 01:05:00,927
Kwebbelkop

1272
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:03,743
Yeah yeah there's just no way reflects

1273
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:05,535
88

1274
01:05:06,047 --> 01:05:07,583
How how would it is babe

1275
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:09,375
What what

1276
01:05:09,631 --> 01:05:11,423
Military is going to be like hey

1277
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:17,311
We are going to let like they don't do it they don't limit their options for murder

1278
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:19,103
That's just how they work

1279
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:22,431
And even when they say they do that doesn't mean I'm going to do

1280
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:24,735
Japan

1281
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:28,319
Like like I'm saying I'm sure someone like

1282
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:29,855
Democracynow would have

1283
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:32,159
A conversation with somebody like this

1284
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:35,487
Or are there other options but I'm sure

1285
01:05:36,255 --> 01:05:37,535
Tipping like a majority report

1286
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:38,559
Talk to

1287
01:05:38,815 --> 01:05:39,839
A person who has this

1288
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:41,631
Kind of position

1289
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:42,655
It had today

1290
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:43,679
Existed at the time

1291
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:46,495
Somebody like Amy Goodman

1292
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:47,519
Wouldn't talk

1293
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:48,287
Like this

1294
01:05:52,127 --> 01:05:54,175
Did you know the people to download music and stuff

1295
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:56,223
Music chairs

1296
01:06:00,063 --> 01:06:01,855
You never

1297
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:03,391
You wouldn't be

1298
01:06:04,415 --> 01:06:05,183
Be talking about Bill

1299
01:06:05,439 --> 01:06:10,559
Clinton becoming the Secretary General of the UN and then becoming president again and

1300
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:12,607
If you go on Napster you going to get it

1301
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:14,399
Executed or haven't life in a

1302
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:15,935
F****** hard labor camp

1303
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:21,055
Man I'm stupid I think he really took those

1304
01:06:21,823 --> 01:06:24,127
You wouldn't steal a car would you

1305
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:27,455
Commercials a little bit too seriously

1306
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:31,295
Remember is that like a whenever like movie piracy was kind of

1307
01:06:31,551 --> 01:06:36,415
A real good before movie review like Ben Affleck

1308
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:37,183
Any real life

1309
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:39,231
Hey guys

1310
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:42,303
We need to support the industry

1311
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:43,583
You can't be taking

1312
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:47,423
I don't remember him saying or we'll kill you

1313
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:48,959
Or you're going

1314
01:06:49,215 --> 01:06:49,727
Intuit labor camp

1315
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:50,751
Hey hey

1316
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:52,543
We understand

1317
01:06:53,311 --> 01:06:53,823
Difficult

1318
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:58,175
It's it's a lot easier to pirate movies maybe there's some distribution issues that week

1319
01:06:58,431 --> 01:06:58,943
Couldn't fix

1320
01:06:59,199 --> 01:06:59,711
But

1321
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:00,479
Don't do it

1322
01:07:00,735 --> 01:07:02,527
It's an industry that could die without your

1323
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:03,807
And if you don't

1324
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:04,575
Supported

1325
01:07:04,831 --> 01:07:06,623
You will die

1326
01:07:07,647 --> 01:07:08,159
These

1327
01:07:08,415 --> 01:07:09,695
Sorts of things

1328
01:07:09,951 --> 01:07:10,463
Make

1329
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:11,743
It really differ

1330
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:13,279
Buckle to take seriously

1331
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:18,911
The actual things that Alex is talking about like interviewing this Belgian is trying to advocate for

1332
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:20,959
Civilians caught in a warzone

1333
01:07:21,215 --> 01:07:21,727
Like it

1334
01:07:21,983 --> 01:07:22,495
It's tough

1335
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:24,031
To see this is

1336
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:25,311
Worthwhile

1337
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:26,591
Even

1338
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:28,127
The things that are valid

1339
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:29,663
There worthwhile use of time

1340
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:30,431
Because

1341
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:35,807
I guess if you're the sort of person who thinks that you're going to be killed for using Napster skin

1342
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:37,599
I don't

1343
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:41,183
I don't know what you can bring to the conversation about this Belgium

1344
01:07:41,439 --> 01:07:45,279
Well I mean bye-bye elevating the steaks

1345
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:47,839
Of a Napster download

1346
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:50,655
You you're like oh no

1347
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:54,495
Human trafficking is a huge problem in the end all this s*** in your like

1348
01:07:54,751 --> 01:07:57,055
Yeah but the stakes are the same as

1349
01:07:57,311 --> 01:08:02,687
Pirating from Napster man like your devaluing other problems by making just

1350
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:04,735
Torrent

1351
01:08:06,783 --> 01:08:09,087
Describe make a farce out of just

1352
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:10,111
About everything

1353
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:13,695
So Alex gets another call from a guy

1354
01:08:13,951 --> 01:08:14,719
This was

1355
01:08:14,975 --> 01:08:17,279
This was weird I didn't know what to make of that okay

1356
01:08:20,351 --> 01:08:21,631
Started coming out with any

1357
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:23,423
3 days

1358
01:08:24,703 --> 01:08:26,751
Today's date

1359
01:08:27,007 --> 01:08:28,031
Newspapers

1360
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:30,591
Is

1361
01:08:30,847 --> 01:08:31,615
Being ran by

1362
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:33,663
Starcom

1363
01:08:34,175 --> 01:08:34,687
Would you the website

1364
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:39,551
Very similar to what you do

1365
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:44,927
This morning

1366
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:47,743
The Rave

1367
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:49,791
Organizations

1368
01:08:52,607 --> 01:08:53,119
Okay

1369
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:56,447
Okay well I didn't

1370
01:08:57,983 --> 01:08:58,495
Don't judge Porter

1371
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:03,103
Not on my show what is this

1372
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:03,871
The fuc

1373
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:07,711
Girl from Wilderness.com that's what he did that's what he just said

1374
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:08,991
Who's confused

1375
01:09:09,247 --> 01:09:13,599
So I went to check out the wilderness.

1376
01:09:13,855 --> 01:09:14,367
Something

1377
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:15,135
Different

1378
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:16,671
8003

1379
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:18,463
It's just like an

1380
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:19,487
A survivalist

1381
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:20,511
Store

1382
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:24,351
Online they sell like gun parts and things that you might need

1383
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:25,887
For the outdoors

1384
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:28,191
The only thing that really

1385
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:31,263
Stuck out to me is that they very prominently support the NRA

1386
01:09:32,031 --> 01:09:34,335
And I think that that might be Alex

1387
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:35,103
Cuz bone with a

1388
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:37,151
Maybe they got into a fight

1389
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:42,271
Because in 2003 our tape the NRA I forgot about that

1390
01:09:42,527 --> 01:09:44,319
You only like more extreme gone or go

1391
01:09:44,575 --> 01:09:45,087
Translation

1392
01:09:45,343 --> 01:09:46,111
In 2003

1393
01:09:46,367 --> 01:09:48,927
Other than that I'm like I don't know maybe it's personal

1394
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:55,327
Like it maybe it's personal between the person who runs that site and Alex

1395
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:59,423
He supported the NRA where is Alex prefers gunownersofamerica

1396
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:01,727
Andrews for the preservation of firearm rights

1397
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:02,495
Yeah but

1398
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:04,031
The way you said I'm not going to talk

1399
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:05,311
About people do that says

1400
01:10:13,247 --> 01:10:18,367
Spiraled out of control I can't imagine why I mean you would need some sort of anger

1401
01:10:18,623 --> 01:10:21,951
Addicted is some sort of man who

1402
01:10:22,207 --> 01:10:23,231
Control his impulses

1403
01:10:23,743 --> 01:10:28,607
To elevate an argument about the NRA into a friendship ending

1404
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:34,751
You know what those still is indicative of a level of control That You Don't See from Alex in the present day

1405
01:10:35,263 --> 01:10:36,799
I'm not going to talk about this

1406
01:10:37,055 --> 01:10:39,359
I do want to talk about people

1407
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:42,943
Not something we here today Brian stelter look weird

1408
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:44,479
Exit

1409
01:10:44,735 --> 01:10:46,527
Strange

1410
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:49,599
What are the things I've noticed

1411
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:52,159
Going back on these 2003 episodes

1412
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:54,975
Is there I think the Alex views his job

1413
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:56,255
Here's how it works

1414
01:10:56,511 --> 01:10:57,023
Some guy

1415
01:10:57,279 --> 01:10:59,327
Headlines for a couple minutes up

1416
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:02,143
Sure just read headlines like a news reader

1417
01:11:02,655 --> 01:11:03,935
Couple minutes at the end of the show

1418
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:05,471
3 hours in

1419
01:11:05,727 --> 01:11:10,079
Read some more headlines

1420
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:16,735
It's about how you open and close strong in the open

1421
01:11:19,295 --> 01:11:25,439
Reader Hitman news but I am a journalist diabetic care business you can take whatever calls you want

1422
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:26,207
Talk to

1423
01:11:26,463 --> 01:11:28,511
The drummer from The Black Keys mom

1424
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:34,911
Do whatever hey in an hour set usually you can only take about 20 minutes off in the middle but it's

1425
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:41,311
If your dude Infowars you can take about 2 hours and 45 off I think I'd be fighting kind of enjoy that but I have noticed that

1426
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:43,615
It seems very intention

1427
01:11:45,663 --> 01:11:46,175
Now

1428
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:48,223
This is one of the news stories that Alex

1429
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:48,991
Decides to hit

1430
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:49,759
At the end of the

1431
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:51,807
The show

1432
01:12:00,255 --> 01:12:02,303
We don't get involved

1433
01:12:05,631 --> 01:12:06,143
Report

1434
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:11,007
Because the only

1435
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:16,383
Squabbling

1436
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:31,487
Rum

1437
01:12:52,991 --> 01:12:53,759
When it was

1438
01:12:58,879 --> 01:12:59,903
William

1439
01:13:00,415 --> 01:13:01,183
Your launcher

1440
01:13:02,463 --> 01:13:04,767
And it goes on and on there will be a massive

1441
01:13:29,087 --> 01:13:29,599
About 20%

1442
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:31,903
Legos

1443
01:13:35,487 --> 01:13:36,767
That's not a news story

1444
01:13:37,023 --> 01:13:37,535
No

1445
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:38,815
That's a gold plug

1446
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:40,095
Yeah guys

1447
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:42,143
A news story

1448
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:46,751
X2 not at any point

1449
01:13:47,775 --> 01:13:48,287
Declare

1450
01:13:48,543 --> 01:13:51,871
That he is syndicated by Ted Anderson who owns Midas resource

1451
01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:55,967
He is at 100%

1452
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:58,015
Affiliated with Genesis communication

1453
01:13:58,271 --> 01:13:58,783
That work

1454
01:13:59,039 --> 01:13:59,551
And

1455
01:14:01,087 --> 01:14:03,391
Is that kind of a protracted thing

1456
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:05,439
You know what you're talkin about gold news

1457
01:14:05,695 --> 01:14:08,511
You should be in Gold 5% you're crazy if you're not

01:14:08,767 --> 01:14:09,279
Like

1459
01:14:09,535 --> 01:14:10,815
Financial advice

1460
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:13,887
That's a commercial

1461
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:16,959
For gold that is being masturbated

1462
01:14:17,215 --> 01:14:18,239
Is a news story

1463
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:19,263
That's f*****

1464
01:14:19,775 --> 01:14:23,103
That's a commercial in 2003 they get too little pat on the head

1465
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:24,383
From Ted Anderson in

1466
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:25,151
Bobcat

1467
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:27,199
Men's ears start to get a little bit hot

1468
01:14:27,455 --> 01:14:29,247
I might have a job soon

1469
01:14:29,503 --> 01:14:34,111
Right cuz you don't want on the show Alex isn't talking about Vitus resources but guess what

1470
01:14:35,135 --> 01:14:35,647
Commercials

1471
01:14:35,903 --> 01:14:37,439
That might as resources puts

1472
01:14:37,695 --> 01:14:38,463
Send forth himself

1473
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:39,999
Alma Street yep

1474
01:14:40,255 --> 01:14:41,791
So like if you are Alex

1475
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:43,327
And you're talking about

1476
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:45,375
How everybody should be in gold

1477
01:14:45,631 --> 01:14:47,935
Has people who are listening to the show

1478
01:14:48,191 --> 01:14:50,495
They will hear the commercials for Genesis Communications

1479
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:53,311
Put two and two together

1480
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:55,615
As good as a commercial for

1481
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:56,383
Fremitus

1482
01:14:56,639 --> 01:14:57,407
At the end of this

1483
01:14:58,431 --> 01:14:59,199
I just think

1484
01:14:59,455 --> 01:15:00,735
I think it's sleazy

1485
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:03,295
Infowars was ahead of the game on hidden

1486
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:04,063
Spawn con

1487
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:07,647
You know is it took awhile to trickle up to the New York

1488
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:09,183
F****** times but we got

1489
01:15:09,439 --> 01:15:12,767
#this s***

1490
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:15,583
About the future everybody made it worse

1491
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:18,143
So you know if you look at this

1492
01:15:19,423 --> 01:15:22,751
You got you got a pretty interesting

1493
01:15:23,007 --> 01:15:24,031
Dynamic

1494
01:15:25,055 --> 01:15:26,591
You have the

1495
01:15:26,847 --> 01:15:29,407
De-baathification still not being a real thing to Alex

1496
01:15:29,663 --> 01:15:30,175
That's what I find

1497
01:15:30,687 --> 01:15:32,223
Bizarre you have

1498
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:34,271
The devil question still be up

1499
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:36,319
A bit open to little bit open

1500
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:37,087
But

1501
01:15:37,343 --> 01:15:37,855
You have

1502
01:15:38,111 --> 01:15:38,623
Bees

1503
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:40,927
Prediction

1504
01:15:41,951 --> 01:15:42,719
Stuff

1505
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:48,607
Like I'd I just ate it's very gratifying to me when you you live in a time when everyone's trying to

1506
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:51,935
Hero-worship Alex's past belief

1507
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:55,007
Yeah and you just go back in you

1508
01:15:55,263 --> 01:15:59,871
Your Glimpse and episode where he has no idea how the UN secretary-general ship works

1509
01:16:00,383 --> 01:16:00,895
You makes

1510
01:16:01,407 --> 01:16:02,687
Sweetly stupid prediction

1511
01:16:02,943 --> 01:16:04,991
About the other political dynamic

1512
01:16:05,503 --> 01:16:06,783
Paradigm

1513
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:07,551
That are going

1514
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:10,111
Going to evolve

1515
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:13,951
There's a bush got re-elected in 2004

1516
01:16:14,207 --> 01:16:15,743
That is true good on a

1517
01:16:17,023 --> 01:16:18,559
Buddy

1518
01:16:19,071 --> 01:16:20,095
Sad sad display

1519
01:16:24,703 --> 01:16:26,495
You know what you listen to Clinton

1520
01:16:26,751 --> 01:16:29,055
Like that's the thing that does get to me like

1521
01:16:30,591 --> 01:16:32,127
That Clinton being like you should come by

1522
01:16:32,383 --> 01:16:34,175
Maybe we shouldn't have those term limits

1523
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:36,223
Like I hate those people so much

1524
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:39,551
We already have the clintons around every f******

1525
01:16:39,807 --> 01:16:40,319
Corner

1526
01:16:40,575 --> 01:16:41,855
In the conspiracy world

1527
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:44,671
Since they shut the f****** in Arkansas

1528
01:16:44,927 --> 01:16:46,207
I've always had

1529
01:16:46,463 --> 01:16:47,487
The clintons in my life

1530
01:16:47,743 --> 01:16:48,767
Causing problems

1531
01:16:49,535 --> 01:16:54,399
I'm tired of them make them go away if you are Bill Clinton

1532
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:58,239
And you're giving the speech at the John F Kennedy Library out of notably

1533
01:16:58,495 --> 01:17:03,103
Young Presidents actually have a sincere belief

1534
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:03,871
That

1535
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:04,895
Organizing

1536
01:17:06,175 --> 01:17:08,735
Then I was the political system could be done better if

1537
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:10,527
Someone were able to come back

1538
01:17:10,783 --> 01:17:12,063
Sure Office later

1539
01:17:12,575 --> 01:17:14,111
Why should you have to not

1540
01:17:14,367 --> 01:17:15,135
Say that just

1541
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:19,231
Because conspiracy theorist will be weird about it

1542
01:17:19,487 --> 01:17:20,767
I'm saying that they should be

1543
01:17:21,023 --> 01:17:21,535
God

1544
01:17:22,047 --> 01:17:23,583
Just go into an island

1545
01:17:24,095 --> 01:17:25,887
Forever Epstein got one open

1546
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:29,215
You guys have already been

1547
01:17:31,263 --> 01:17:32,543

Movieweb.com

1549
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:46,367
Go to bed Jordan

1550
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:53,791

Birthstone colors
