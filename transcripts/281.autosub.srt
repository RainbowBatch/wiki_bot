2019

48
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:45,536
Something that I wanted to do or kind of thought about doing

49
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,840
Was

50
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:48,864
Some of the stuff

51
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,888
What happened wow

52
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:51,168
On break

53
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,960
I took just a catch-up to prezza

54
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:54,240
Someday as it work

55
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:57,056
Compilation

56
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:59,104

59
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:13,696
Now That's What I Call Music 44

60
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:16,000
Looking through some of it

61
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,024
I was like well

62
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:20,095
Get mired down in a bog

63
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:23,167
If we do that we're never going to get back to present

64
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:26,495
If we just constantly are like looking back in the rearview at

65
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:29,311
Something that might have been kind of f***** up that happened

66
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:33,407
Alex the chicken restaurant for him yelling at them

67
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:35,455
That's alright

68
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,783
Joe Rogan came on Alex's show

69
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,319
And that's all good and well that's

70
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,599
That's totally fun

71
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,927
Make that not so

72
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:45,695
Something I missed

73
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:47,487
We need to talk about all that much

74
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:48,511
It's two things

75
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:49,791
First

76
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:52,351
Is that when Joe comes on Alex's

77
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,119
The show

78
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:56,447
What's really going on is Joe is being sucked up

79
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,543
Show

80
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,591
Instructor Joe being f***** up

81
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:07,455
When Alex goes on Joe show that's interesting for our purposes

82
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,735
Because that's about Alex

83
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,551
Show coming on Alex's

84
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:15,903
Kind of about Alex but Alex's are staying the same s*** he usually doesn't Jose like wow

85
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,231
So who gives a s***

86
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:26,911
Ivan the second thing is that I listen to

87
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,191
March 25th

88
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,263
Episode part where Rogan was

89
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,567
And it's just a 20-minute

90
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:36,895
Segments of the one-hour interview

91
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:37,663
Croagunk

92
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,455
And it's entirely just

93
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,735
Based on the

94
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:47,135
You want to see the rest is kind of a teaser

95
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:52,511
Trailer on His Radio Show in order to lure people to his website

96
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:57,119
I'd rather jump

97
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,167
Tupac closer to the present

98
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:01,727
Since this will be

99
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:07,615
Thursday's episode wanted to do Thursday and Friday April 4th and 5th

100
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:08,383
But there's

101
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,919
There's too much on the 4th

102
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,967
That I had to look into

103
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:14,015
And I think is very important for our purpose

104
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:15,807
And so

105
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:16,575
Unfortunately

106
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:19,647
Get to it eventually

107
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:29,119
I forgot my mom's birthday happy Birthday gorgeous mom

108
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:37,823
That response was not the I forgot my mom's birthday

109
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:47,039
Well I'm glad that we're going over this.

110
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:49,855
Both my brother and my mom's birthday

111
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:52,671
To give them a phone call because as we learned in this first clip

112
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,439
We might not be

113
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,207
Here too long

114
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:58,815
April 4th

115
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:01,887
2019 under Hub Dallas jobs

116
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,935
Well I just walked in there

117
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:06,751
2 minutes ago

118
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,055
But the headline

119
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:12,127
For the

120
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,175
Has a show in it

121
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:16,735
To share the audio and video link

122
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,319
And a headline

123
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,927
It's only 6 months away

124
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:27,487
Total civilizational

125
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:33,887
Collapse put off this call for six months it won't really true

126
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:38,495
Concept civilization collapses

127
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:40,031
I hope you

128
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,079
He will

129
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:48,735

This April 4th

132
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,295
Episode

133
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,319
Demons

134
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,599
Okay

135
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,367
Visa vie

136
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,135
Kanye West

137
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:58,719
If you recall not a couple of months

138
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,487
Sagapo Alex

139
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:06,655
Get Kanye on his show desperately

140
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:09,983
Democratic altitude is changed

141
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:17,407
Universe

142
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:30,719
Twisted Sage

143
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:36,351
Sworn to destroy all human life

144
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,399
On this planet

145
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,287
Bible stand

146
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:47,359
Judaism Islam says

147
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:54,015
So demons are telling Kanye West to do something I don't know you're the guy who knows a pop-culture

148
00:08:54,271 --> 00:09:00,415
Little bit more than me

149
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:03,231
I do believe

150
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,023
Brunswick

151
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,559
He has a Dark Twisted Fantasy

152
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:08,607
Demonic sorcerer

153
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:15,263
This is just about the idea that Kanye was like saying

154
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,103
Slavery was before and I shouldn't said that

155
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:21,407
Alex's I think he's trying to say

156
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,175
Like

157
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:25,503
Not saying those things anymore for a bit

158
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:45,983
Hey give me a give me a shout out for 808 and heartbreaks

159
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:53,407
It's a what's going on here and

160
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:56,735
In terms of all the stuff that I like to look into

161
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,527
So I just decided

162
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,551
Leave that alone

163
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,855
But it is

164
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:08,767
Is very important because it inform some of the stuff

165
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:09,535
It's coming up

166
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:10,559
On this episode

167
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:13,887
Alex talks about

168
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:16,191
Not the kids toy

169
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:20,031
And indicates that he knows nothing

170
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,055
About that

171
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:26,175
By the way everything Plato wrote about almost all of it they've dug up or found

172
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:35,903
Brought about

173
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,183
That was Atlantis

174
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:43,839
In the Atlantic Ocean Island said flying machines and an energy

175
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,887
Power exploded

176
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,679
And then four years

177
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:52,287
Because of all the dust in the air

178
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:54,847
Really happens like that

179
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:55,615
Great

180
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:01,247
Until

181
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,807
Might have been talking to somebody

182
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:07,903
He fixes boilers little horns a little teeth so you don't get scared

183
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:20,447
Deal with the Devil.

184
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:30,431
Plato only talked about Atlantis a couple times

185
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,711
Tomatoes and critias

186
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:35,039
The two dialogs none of that stuff

187
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:41,439
Impact the destruction of Atlantis

188
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:47,839
Telling of it has to do with the fact that they got into a war the atlanteans

189
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:50,399
Put them down

190
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,007
Are smaller cities

191
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,287
We're able to take out

192
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:59,359
The atlanteans and then the gods punish them with earthquake

193
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:02,175
Corn stuff I got it wasn't a white glowing power-source attic

194
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,199
Exploded in flying

195
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,479
Washington all that b*******

196
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:07,295
Netflix

197
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:11,391
I love the idea of him just saying like

198
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:19,327
What artists Martin said I think he said

199
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:23,423
I think that's what is the location

200
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,215
Okay

201
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:29,823
I thought all his right ear like we got it

202
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:36,223
Like the idea of a of an archaeologist being like

203
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:41,087
Video game missions list

204
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:45,695
Yeah that's crazy but then also the other thing is I was like

205
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:48,511
You think

206
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,559
That's like if you read tomatoes

207
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:53,375
When critias you know why he knows this information

208
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,959
That is B Salon

209
00:12:57,215 --> 00:13:01,311
Legendary ruler ancient Greece

210
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,615
He went and spoke with the

211
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,383
Egyptian

212
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,663
You went over to Egypt

213
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,687
Egyptian

214
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:08,223
She got the story of Atlanta

215
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:08,991
This from the Egypt

216
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:09,759
Came back

217
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:10,783
Controls that

218
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,063
Plato's grandfather

219
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:15,135
I believe and that's how it got passed down to check out

220
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:17,951
That's it's clear the lineage of information

221
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:19,487
In Plato's writing

222
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:21,023
The clear he's not talking to Demons

223
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,559
Though it is very important

224
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:23,327
Again

225
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:26,399
Dementia Metallica saying that they hide their teeth

226
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,167
So they don't

227
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,495
Thing for them to do that is important

228
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:32,799
So hold on to that thought as we jump

229
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:35,871
You never reply.

230
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:39,455
Are you hiding your teeth and wings from me

231
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,223
I'm not

232
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:42,527
But we will get into where he go

233
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:44,575
Get that idea from

234
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:47,903
Is almost gone

235
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,439
Purposeful

236
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,463
Take down

237
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,255
Of the planet

238
00:13:55,327 --> 00:14:01,471
Not just to the Stars to other dimensions

239
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:04,799
Elevation

240
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,847
Purposes

241
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,895
They found forms of immortality

242
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:17,087
We're just a thought

243
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:21,695
Youfit globalism was always meant to fail

244
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,815
The sublevel

245
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:29,631
Not the actual Elite the shovel age

246
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,967
Get really high level

247
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:50,367
Percent of humans will be taken out.

248
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,647
The whole picture

249
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,719
You're told humans are an abomination

250
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:59,583
God says we will give us a code

251
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,143
I truly forever with him

252
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:06,239
And be uploaded to the Consciousness and then move on to the next planet

253
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:09,055
You like wait a minute

254
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:15,199
Call childhood

255
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:21,599
The real Illuminati

256
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,279
OSS before that

257
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,815
Total highest level

258
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:33,887
To see you read those books you watch those movies

259
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:35,679
Explain something to you

260
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,727
They're telling you how the cow ate the cabbage

261
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,287
What is mouth

262
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,663
The cabbage

263
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,199
Alex loves that expression

264
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,527
Feel like a fool

265
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,343
Ever have

266
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:56,415
Simply because it made me remember something I'd forgotten

267
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,951
And that I really should have remember

268
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,999
I read childhood

269
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:02,815
The 1950s

270
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:03,839
Clark Beckham jr.

271
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:07,679
But unfortunately

272
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:10,751
I remember that it was about an alien invasion

273
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:12,031
Destruction

274
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:14,847
Planet little bit Gray

275
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,943
Visit the

276
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:25,087
And when I did I realize that Alex is very well maybe

277
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,367
The power behind the globalist

278
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,647
On childhood's end

279
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:28,671
Have you ever read it

280
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:32,511
No I'm not ready okay good cuz I'm going to

281
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:35,071
But I also

282
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:35,839
I wasn't

283
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,631
Totally huge on Syfy as I

284
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,167
As I've gotten to like

285
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:43,519
Late Junior High into high school that wasn't certain my bike up at

286
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:46,847
Sweeter when I was

287
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:48,895
Younger but unfortunately because

288
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,175
I read a lot of things

289
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:52,735
Before I was probably old enough to really

290
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:55,295
Internalized a lot of them had lost my memory of it

291
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,319
Tana should I read

292
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:59,647
Yesterday

293
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,927
Because I like

294
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:01,951
I need to get into this

295
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:07,327
So if you have it then

296
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:10,143
The book is about a child

297
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:16,543
There's a SyFy Network series based on it

298
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:17,567
Couple years back

299
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:23,967
Future where the countries of Earth are at the brink of nuclear war by way of militarizing

300
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:24,735
Space race

301
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:26,783
Destroy the planet

302
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:31,391
For the trigger could be pulled alien ships appear and nuclear war gets put on the back burner

303
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:34,207
These are going to be supervising

304
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,487
To make sure that we don't bring

305
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:36,255
Extinction

306
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:39,327
And since there are a ton of spaceships over majors

307
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,607
Humanity goes along with it

308
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:47,519
The aliens called the overlords are in charge of the major issues of the world at all

309
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:52,639
The only direct interference that they have an international relations

310
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:56,735
And other than that outside of the sphere of international relations

311
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,271
Humanity

312
00:17:58,527 --> 00:17:59,039
These affairs

313
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:00,575
Watch The Outlaw bullfighting

314
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:01,855
Because the barbaric

315
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:04,159
And wants to relieve the persecution

316
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,695
One of the white minority and post

317
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:06,719
Apartheid South Africa

318
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,279
Because at the time that he wrote this

319
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,119
There was a perception of Apartheid

320
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,143
And then it's all going

321
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,935
Go to be flipped in the white minority there is

322
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:16,959
Be brutally prefer

323
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,519
Call imagine that being

324
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:23,615
The overlords Clark

325
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:24,383
Conceived of

326
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:26,175
Would think that was such an inhumane

327
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:26,943
Situation

328
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:29,503
That he would try they would try and rectify that

329
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:34,111
Unsurprising

330
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,135
The overlords wood

331
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:35,903
Be supporting

332
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:43,839
That's the future he did now

333
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:44,863
It's just fun

334
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:50,239
So the overlord supervisor Carolyn to the secretary-general

335
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,007
United Nation

336
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,823
Which is where we get one of our first connection to Alex's world

337
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,871
Alex believes that the globalist

338
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:58,431
The man whom the leadership of the UNR

339
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:00,735
They take their orders from an off-world race

340
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,783
An idea that is a very basic

341
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:04,575
Of childhoods

342
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:05,855
Emma storyline

343
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:06,623
They're up

344
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:08,159
Joker Ellen speak

345
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:11,231
Next to the secretary-general

346
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:12,255
His physical form

347
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,303
The secretary-general presses on the

348
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:19,167
And likely won't fully trusty overlords if they

349
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:22,751
Karelin discusses the idea of his superiors and

350
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:26,335
Decides to promise to show their true form to humanity

351
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,359
After 50 years

352
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:32,735
Appointed which humans will have gotten used to the overlords being around and will be so shocking

353
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:33,759
For them to see

354
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:34,783
Their true form

355
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,599
When the time comes

356
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:39,135
The overlords apr2

357
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:41,951
And they look exactly like the traditional image of.

358
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:45,023
This is the second direct mirrored Alex's world

359
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,071
He believes that offworld entity

360
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:49,119
Please that are giving orders to the globalist Iraq

361
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:51,679
Who don't want you to think of their demons

362
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:55,263
We heard it earlier than that clip said they're hiding their teeth and wings

363
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:57,311
So you don't you don't get afraid

364
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:01,151
The concept of mask the image of looking like a

365
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:03,199
Frost is an idea

366
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:05,503
But he almost certainly lifted wholesale from this

367
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:06,783
Almost in

368
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:11,647
And it gets it gets weirder

369
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:16,511
I remember this now the secretary-general in childhood

370
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:17,535
Childhood's end

371
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:25,215
The Moon is that crazy who's Ricky

372
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:33,151
Exactly his last name but yeah

373
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:39,551
Humanity through a number of years of prosperity and peace ultimately uninspired and

374
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:45,439
So an artist colony is established in opposition to the overlords

375
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,463
The people are doing

376
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:48,511
On an island called

377
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:53,631
The colony is supposed to be utopian place where Humanity can Thrive but ultimately

378
00:20:53,887 --> 00:21:00,031
The inhabitants there blow themselves up with a nuclear bomb which I think is where Alex is getting his ideas about what happened to Atlantis from

379
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:02,079
That we heard earlier in this episode

380
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:05,663
If only he was really into banana

381
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:12,831
Underneath his house

382
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:14,879
That he worship that would make Justice

383
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,440
Good babe

384
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:23,840
So I'm skipping over a lot of stuff here but aren't necessarily here to help you

385
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:26,144
Usher

386
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,936
Into the next phase of our

387
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,728
These are the orders of

388
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:31,264
Something called the over

389
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:32,288
Thuja god-like

390
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:34,336
It's made up of

391
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:35,360
Of other species

392
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:36,640
From throughout the planet

393
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:38,176
Throughout the Universe

394
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:40,992
The overlords mission was

395
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:41,760
Facilitate

396
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:43,040
The inevitable

397
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:44,832
Humanity into the overmind

398
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:46,112
Cosmic

399
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:47,904
Midwives unable to ascend

400
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,928
Into the overmind

401
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:53,024
Only able to experience of the Divine process vicariously

402
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:58,144
This also mirrors Alex's ideas about the globalist black and some spark that Humanity has

403
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,424
Something that they are

404
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:02,240
It's not so clear from that the text

405
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:07,616
That the Gaillardia

406
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:09,152
To become one with the overmind

407
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:10,176
But knowing Alex's

408
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:10,944
Psychology

409
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,712
It's easy to

410
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:12,480
See how he would put

411
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:13,504
Project that onto

412
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:18,624
Do these characters in the book how bitter about the

413
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,184
They just have to serve the overmind and help

414
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,208
Become one with you

415
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:25,024
And it's not a it's not like a manipulation

416
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,560
That was something that was going to happen

417
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:31,680
What's happening one way or the other they were just there to help the process

418
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:32,704
Let's go smoothly

419
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:35,008
To us

420
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:35,776
For something like

421
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:36,544
But Alex

422
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,080
As a suspicious guy

423
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:40,128
Could easily read the book if you like

424
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:43,712
They made the kids

425
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,856
Lack of creative

426
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,136
Like 88

427
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:54,976
Add arle overlords the overmind

428
00:22:55,232 --> 00:23:01,376
You're asking me the overtime but also to

429
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:03,424
These ideas from like another book from like the 90

430
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,192
30s

431
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:07,008
Someone else wrote ideas

432
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,800
That he had read other places

433
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:11,616
Anything like that

434
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:15,200
I think the book was good I enjoyed it and everything but I also thought it had some

435
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,736
Structural problem

436
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:25,184
Exploring

437
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:28,256
The becoming one with the overmind happens

438
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:30,048
Because the children of earth begin to

439
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:32,352
Express psychic abilities that evolve quickly

440
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:34,912
They become more and more of a unified and

441
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:37,472
All of these individual children become one

442
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:39,264
Theater the metaphor

443
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,032
Use the idea of

444
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:40,800
Like Island

445
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:44,640
While the ocean is there appear to be separate the ocean disappears

446
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:45,664
You see them as

447
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,432
Connected

448
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:47,200
Through

449
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,736
The bottom of the ocean

450
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:51,040
All of the islands are actually the

451
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,624
That's what happens to these children they all become one

452
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:55,904
And become

453
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,696
I'm completely a different thing than the rest of

454
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:58,976
Humanity

455
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:04,864
The overlords are not doing this to the children they are just there to Usher through the process that's happening with or without

456
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:07,680
However the misrepresentation that there's some

457
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:09,728
Do children of Earth is completely alive

458
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:12,544
I have to go almost there targeting the children

459
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,616
And trying to change them who the water through hormone

460
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:16,384
These sorts of

461
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:18,432
Baby ID

462
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:20,480
All the attacks

463
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:21,760
Clearly mirror

464
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:23,808
In a misreading of childhood's end

465
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:27,904
Any idea has destroyed

466
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,440
The overlords by the way

467
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:34,304
And the children mature enough to ascend into Oneness with the overbite

468
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:37,120
The overlords move on to wait their next mission

469
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:38,144
From the overmind

470
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,424
The next species

471
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:41,728
With Aiden

472
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:44,800
Roderick

473
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:47,104
Escape the chaos on Earth by Stone

474
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:47,872
Supply ship

475
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:49,664
It goes back to the overlords planet

476
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:53,248
He has a conversation with some of the aliens about what's going on

477
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:55,040
And realizes there's nothing left

478
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:56,064
At all

479
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,368
He hasn't over this ending with Uvalde

480
00:24:58,624 --> 00:24:59,904
Children there no more humans

481
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,464
Very well becoming Overlord

482
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,048
What kind of an existence would you have if you just went along with them to the next

483
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:09,120
Planet that they go

484
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:11,168
Functional functionally immortal

485
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:13,728
The overlords live forever he wouldn't even make it to the next

486
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:14,752
Inappropriate

487
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:16,032
So you have nothing left

488
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:18,080
Decides to witness the end of her

489
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:19,616
The end of the planet

490
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:21,408
The overlord

491
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:22,432
About to experience

492
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:23,200
As it

493
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:28,064
Because they have cameras watching the planet but they don't know experientially what it's

494
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:29,088
Like for the end of

495
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:32,672
Planet planet in report

496
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:36,256
That the destruction of the plant because he realizes

497
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:37,792
Is that the overlords work

498
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:39,328
Some sort of nefarious

499
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:41,120
He's giving them whatever information

500
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:46,240
Could be helpful to them besides everybody has a purpose

501
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:47,776
But before that happen

502
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:50,592
He has this exchange with rash of very

503
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:51,872
Another one of the Overlook

504
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:56,992
And said here's something else you've never explained

505
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:58,528
When your race first

506
00:25:58,784 --> 00:25:59,552
First came to Earth

507
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:00,320
The distant past

508
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:01,344
What went wrong

509
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:04,416
Have you become the symbol of fear and Evil

510
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,464
Rash of Eric smile

511
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:10,304
He didn't do this as well as karelin could but it was a fair imitation

512
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:12,352
No one ever guess

513
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:14,656
And you see now why we could never tell you

514
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:17,728
There was only one event that could have made such an impact

515
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:21,568
But at the very end

516
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,104
What do you mean

517
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:27,968
What are your skies a century-and-a-half ago

518
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:30,016
That was the first meeting of our two races

519
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:32,832
You from a distance

520
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:34,624
And get you feared and recognize

521
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:36,416
As we knew that you would

522
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:38,464
He wasn't precisely a memory

523
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:41,792
You've already have already had proof

524
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:44,608
The time is more complex than your science ever imagine

525
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:46,912
For that.

526
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:48,960
For that memory was not of the past

527
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:49,984
But if the future

528
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,824
Azusa closing gears when your racewood known everything was finished

529
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:56,384
We did what we could but it wasn't

530
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,152
Keynesian

531
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:58,688
And because we were there

532
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:00,480
We became identified with your races

533
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:03,552
Yes even while it was 10,000

534
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:04,320
In the future

535
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:08,416
It's as if a distorted Echo and reverberated rounds and closed circle of time

536
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:09,696
In the future the past

537
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:12,768
Call it a not a memory but a premonition

538
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:14,816
The idea was hard to grasp

539
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:16,864
Silence

540
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:19,680
Yeah you should have been prepared

541
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:21,216
Proof enough that cause and effect

542
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:21,984
Good reversed

543
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,008
And they're normal sequence

544
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:26,080
There must be such a thing as racial memory

545
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:27,872
And that memory is somehow

546
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:28,640
Time

547
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:30,688
Do it the future in the past or one

548
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:31,968
That is why

549
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:33,760
Years ago man had already glimpsed

550
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:35,296
Distorted image of the overlord

551
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:37,344
The fear and Terror

552
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:40,928
Erase memory don't make sense

553
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,464
When you think about it be

554
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,256
An expression of epigenetics

555
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:46,304
And he always talks about the ideas

556
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,072
Being something much

557
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,864
Located in grander than

558
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,632
Instinct

559
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,704
What he believes doesn't line up with anything real

560
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,752
But it lines up perfectly with the concept

561
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:55,776
Expressed in childhood

562
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,336
I think that Alex just believe the science

563
00:27:58,592 --> 00:27:59,104
Fiction books are real

564
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:00,640
Childhood's end

565
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:01,664
A giant

566
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:03,712
That explains so much

567
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,504
What Alex beliefs about the

568
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:07,040
Bees that are behind

569
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:08,064
Globalist

570
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:08,832
But he's again

571
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:10,624
And I feel really stupid

572
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:14,720
No that's stupid but I wish I could remember that book better

573
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:21,888
Months and months ago whenever you're going through this because I think a lot of our confusion could have been dismissed with like he's just talked about

574
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:22,912
Can Arthur C Clarke

575
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,960
You think that's real

576
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:26,496
Reasonable for you to have missed

577
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:27,520
And let me tell you

578
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:29,824
Cuz I was like 13 when I read it

579
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,384
No because this is another book

580
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,176
To the list of books that Alex

581
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:36,224
And that is a shock ever

582
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:39,296
425

583
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:41,856
That's a

584
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:44,672
I think he was probably super illiterate when he was younger

585
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:48,768
Like I don't think I think his inability to read or unwillingness

586
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,304
He is probably a more

587
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:56,704
Recent feature of his life I think probably in junior high and high school he was probably

588
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,288
He was a Satanist

589
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:01,312
True

590
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:03,872
Satanism science-fiction

591
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:09,248
I think if we

592
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,808
We're a little bit more critical of him

593
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,600
I think we would end up finding

594
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:14,368
Almost

595
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:19,232
He thinks his real that sounds stupid go back

596
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:23,072
Like it's just all old scientific

597
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:25,120
All right we got a new book club

598
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:27,424
I think we do what the hell

599
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,448
Right

600
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:30,752
Start with asiimov and move on from there

601
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:33,568
Isaac Asimov vitamin too hard for it

602
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:35,616
I think you probably sticks

603
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:36,640
To be more pop

604
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:39,712
Kind of cereal

605
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:44,320
So I think this is crazy credibly stupid

606
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:46,368
Reading that book was the

607
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:48,160
There's that

608
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:48,928
Oh my God

609
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:52,000
I can't believe I talked about racial memory in this book

610
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:58,400
It was just a book that talked about racial memory I wouldn't be like alright that's one thing

611
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:01,728
But the fact that it's the same book where you have

612
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:03,008
An alien race

613
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,544
The communicates with the UN

614
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,568
It involves

615
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:06,336
Messing with

616
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:08,128
Quit messing with the children

617
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:13,248
The demise of the planet the races and the idea of them

618
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:15,296
Hiding their appearance cuz they look like

619
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:16,832
What we think of his demon

620
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:20,160
Like all of that is so much Alex in one

621
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,464
Concentrated burst

622
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,000
Those nuts

623
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,280
Is a real Revelation from

624
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:28,608
Hodor twist

625
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,424
I like that

626
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,960
So anyway

627
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:35,264
This week's Alex ain't got to follow God

628
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:38,848
This might as well just being overzealous

629
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:42,176
Just programmed swine

630
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,040
I'm not sure they did they were very

631
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:48,576
Restrained

632
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:54,464
Group

633
00:30:57,792 --> 00:31:01,888
An alter-ego

634
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,192
Operations against

635
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:05,728
But one way or the other

636
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:10,336
Intelligent

637
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:12,640
Following orders

638
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:16,480
Nevermind

639
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:22,624
They're trying to override it

640
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:25,184
Lucifer

641
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:31,072
The globalist commercial break

642
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:35,424
He's a little over-the-top it's not his face.

643
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:38,496
Do you like bacon goddamn

644
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:42,336
Yeah I guess what Alex believes the opposite

645
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:44,896
Forces in the world are our Jesus

646
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:46,944
Science fiction

647
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,248
That are real

648
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:50,016
Great

649
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:52,832
I don't understand the Imagine

650
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,440
Like it's B pretty embarrassing

651
00:31:57,696 --> 00:32:00,256
Like his actual beliefs that he's a thousand

652
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:07,168
Do this show over text when I hear stuff like that

653
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:08,960
What's important isn't like

654
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:09,728
Debunking

655
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:10,496
In his world

656
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:11,776
Because it's

657
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:13,312
It's an embarrassing Act

658
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,592
To do

659
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:16,128
I still enjoy doing it

660
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:22,272
Sometimes never read childhood

661
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:25,088
But the important thing is cutting

662
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:26,368
Through the effect

663
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:28,416
He has on the world

664
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:29,696
How stupid this bowls

665
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:32,768
And so that's why I'm glad that this next clip

666
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:34,304
Leads us into that territory

667
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:36,096
When Alex comes back

668
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:38,144
He starts talking about the idea

669
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,216
That you know there's a difference

670
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:42,496
Between Christian

671
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:43,776
And non-christians

672
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:46,592
Even if you are genetically the same

673
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:51,712
Genetically similar Christian and non-Christian there's a fundamental difference between

674
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:52,480
Two of them

675
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:55,552
This is this is going to leave me too

676
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,344
I'm pretty

677
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,744
Kimber wander any other cases all the world

678
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,848
Everything else

679
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,152
Have a tribe that's Christian

680
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:23,456
But I always produced

681
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:25,760
20 *

682
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:27,808
Prosperity

683
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:29,088
20

684
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:32,672
He says 20 times more

685
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:36,768
Alex is like this, too.

686
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:38,560
Actions are more productive

687
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:40,096
Banana mystery

688
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:41,376
You at the group switch

689
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:45,472
Because

690
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:51,360
He goes on to say that he's not even talking about Mainline glitterbug Christian Christian

691
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:53,920
Which is something that's only vaguely defined

692
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:55,712
Even buy him if at all

693
00:33:55,968 --> 00:34:00,320
So I've no idea how anyone would be able to study that in order to produce productivity statistics

694
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:06,720
Real Christians first genetically similar anime

695
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:13,120
Ideas for a

696
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:15,936
Computer research study

697
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:19,008
I don't understand how that would work

698
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:20,800
What are those BuzzFeed quizzes

699
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:26,944
What what what kind of person are you a real how productive are you go from there

700
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:31,552
It's ludicrous I pretty sure he's making it up and I don't really have any interest in

701
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:32,320
Discussing it

702
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:37,952
My sense of it because I've listened to a ton of him is he's using productivity there as kind of Apple

703
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:38,720
Placeholder

704
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:40,512
I did to talk about

705
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:41,792
Relative value of

706
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:43,584
Yeah

707
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,376
I want to take a moment to discuss

708
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:51,008
Because like I said it falls in line with this thing that Alex does all the time where he likes to create the perception

709
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:55,360
But if there's a group of Christians living next to a group of Muslims or anime

710
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:59,200
Invariably the Christian group will be upright great citizen

711
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:03,296
And the Muslims will try to f*** with

712
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:06,368
As Alex isn't that sounds right

713
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,672
So it provides

714
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:09,696
A ton of his writer

715
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:10,976
Not just this clip

716
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,768
It's something that is a is a

717
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:13,792
Piece of his worldview

718
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:15,584
He's expressing in the

719
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,888
Auspices of discussing productivity

720
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:19,168
But that's not what

721
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,192
Is about

722
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:22,496
And what makes this expresses

723
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:25,312
Particularly f***** up is like you responded

724
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:27,104
Uses the example of Rwanda

725
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:30,432
The reason is that the problem is there was that whole genocide

726
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:32,992
94

727
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:34,784
Which is perpetrated by the Hutu

728
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:35,808
Patootie

729
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,368
Well it's true that some Tootsie were Christian

730
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:39,392
And somewhere Muslim

731
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:40,928
The Hutu were mostly Christian

732
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:43,488
But the real issue here is not that

733
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:44,768
And the real issue is

734
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,560
The religious aspect

735
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:48,352
Very little to do

736
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,120
With what happened

737
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:51,680
Against the Tutsi

738
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:54,240
The direct result of Belgium Colonial ization

739
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:55,264
Central Africa

740
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:59,360
When the control of Rwanda from Germany

741
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:01,664
They found a unified culture that was made up of three

742
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:04,224
The Tutsi Hutu and floppy

743
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:08,064
Differences in physical characteristics and traditional occupation

744
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,856
They existed as a single group

745
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:12,672
In the days of like let's say 400 years back

746
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:14,720
The Tutsi and Hutu lived in the symbiotics.

747
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:18,304
The Tutsi herders raise cattle on the land couldn't be used

748
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,840
The crops and manure from

749
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:21,120
The cattle would multiply the

750
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:21,888
Videos of the crop

751
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:22,912
Apps that were raised by the Goo

752
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:23,680
Go to Farmers

753
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:25,728
The belgians differences

754
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:26,752
Groups

755
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:29,312
As evidence of prevailing theories of the time about Aetna

756
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:30,336
Superiority

757
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:33,920
This is to say that the majority Hutu were mostly peasants

758
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:38,016
Well the Tutsi were mostly cattle herders and up had more property

759
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:40,320
And had physical characteristics more attractive

760
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:41,600
To the colonizer

761
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:44,928
That's the belgians believe that the Tutsi were better people

762
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:46,720
They provided education

763
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:47,488
For the Tutsi and

764
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:49,024
Established indirect rule over

765
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,048
The country through them

766
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,352
Though they were a minority of the population

767
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:53,376
Making up on the

768
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:55,168
Country

769
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:57,728
In 1926 the belgians

770
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,264
SD

771
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,592
Which position

772
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:05,408
The power and authority over things like

773
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:06,176
Taxation

774
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:09,760
The Alita manga Tootsie's all the benefits that came from going along with

775
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:11,296
The belgians of setup

776
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:15,136
Were they were the Superior Group who wielded all the political power in the country

777
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:17,952
The ethnic status quo was reinforced

778
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:18,720
Internally

779
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:21,536
Empowerment Group

780
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:22,560
Began to get organized

781
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:23,840
Such as the association

782
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:24,608
For social

783
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:25,888
Promotion

784
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:27,424
And the hutus social movement

785
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:29,984
Two groups that would combine the 1959

786
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:33,568
Keeshond

787
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,872
The party of movement

788
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:36,640
To I-40 map

789
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:41,760
Naturally just made the tootsie Elites a little bit nervous so they started their own

790
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:44,576
Union Nacional rwandaise

791
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:46,880
Which would begin clashing with a hoot

792
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:48,416
Inevitably

793
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:50,976
The crisis became violin

794
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:52,768
And many Tootsie went to Exile

795
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:56,864
Whereupon largely Hutu Rwanda voted for its independence in 90

796
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,752
From this point onward the tootsie that remained in Rolando we're harshly ruprecht minority

797
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:05,824
Flag before independence

798
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,104
Ugis from their Homeland

799
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,896
Gorilla attacks

800
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:11,456
Across the borders of Zaire Uganda in Tampa

801
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,040
Part of this was probably motivated by the fact that many of the

802
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:16,064
Duty at work

803
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,112
Interested in the countries that they

804
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:21,184
Where they found themselves unable to successfully start a new life

805
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,208
And wanted to go back

806
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:27,072
The Ugandan government to both Milton a boat and Idi Amin

807
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:30,656
Establish rules that made the Rwandan refugees

808
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:33,472
You're subject to arbitrary detention by the police

809
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,752
Amber scapegoated for

810
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:35,520
Domestic

811
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:37,824
Which only exacerbated their desire to go

812
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:38,848
Back home

813
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,664
Between 1987 and 1990 the tubes

814
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,688
The group

815
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:43,712
Call Deborah

816
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,040
Front the RPS

817
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:49,856
Attempted to negotiate a quote unconditional return

818
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:51,392
Of all Rwandan refugees

819
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:53,184
Angela kordall Rwanda

820
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:53,952
Is equal rights

821
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:56,768
The Hutu president

822
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:57,792
Papa Romano's

823
00:38:58,048 --> 00:39:01,120
Cruise. No more people

824
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:03,168
Crpf took up arms

825
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:07,520
Interesting border this past Friday

826
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:10,336
More of you

827
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:11,616
Do our country is full

828
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:12,896
Very similar rhetoric

829
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:14,432
Does never

830
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:15,712
Good places

831
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:18,272
The fighting went on for 3 years

832
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:20,064
On the verge of victory

833
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:21,856
When foreign forces intervene

834
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:24,160
To save the harbor yamani government

835
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:25,184
These forces

836
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,976
Ironically included the Belgium

837
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:30,304
Who's 60 years prior he's set up a brutally protein social

838
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,632
Structure only now to be militarily aiding the Hutu government

839
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:34,912
Repulsing the Tootsie

840
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:35,936
She from

841
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:36,704
Returning to the

842
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:38,496
They don't give a fuk

843
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:39,776
These people do not

844
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,080
Colonialism

845
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:43,616
On April 6th

846
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:46,688
1994 president

847
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:48,736
His private jet was shot down here

848
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:49,504
Kigali Airport

849
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:51,552
Crpf

850
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:53,600
The Tutsi claim that the Hutu extremists

851
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:56,672
Adam cell shot down the plane of the false flag against

852
00:39:57,184 --> 00:40:01,280
The course is Still Remains an open question although there's pretty strong indication

853
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,096
The arguments about something

854
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:05,888
False Flags

855
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:07,424
And the RPF probably dead

856
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,192
Almost there

857
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,496
Regardless what happened next

858
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:11,776
Is much less an open Quest

859
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:14,336
The next 100 days

860
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:17,152
Between 800000 and 1 million tooth

861
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:17,920
They were slaughtered

862
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:19,968
By the Rwandan Army

863
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:23,552
As well as the government-backed civilian militia the intercom way

864
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,344
Some estimates claim that

865
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,880
7 out of 10 226

866
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:27,648
Sims were murdered

867
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,184
In the genocide of 90

868
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:31,744
94

869
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,280
12 people who are murdered

870
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:36,096
Which made up approximately one-third of their population

871
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:38,400
After propaganda started circulating that the

872
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:39,424
Patois

873
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,960
And abetting

874
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:41,984
Of course they do

875
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:43,520
This piece of History

876
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:44,800
Unspeakably horrible

877
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:46,080
And the consequences of which ran

878
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:48,640
Inspired of the direct result of indirect result

879
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:51,200
Of colonial with systems that were put in place by the belt

880
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:54,784
Alex and talk about to have a Christian African is great but

881
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,832
Banana Mr Muslim African

882
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:57,600
Is Barbera

883
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:01,440
But that the Cowardly an idiotic way to look at the world

884
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:02,976
But doesn't match up with history at all

885
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:05,280
Also the belgians were Christian

886
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:09,376
Consideration about what the Belgian

887
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:10,400
Did to the Congo

888
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:12,704
Were King Leopold the 2nd

889
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,984
Countryside

890
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:18,080
Harvest natural resources like rubber

891
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:19,104
And killed Millie

892
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:22,688
Or just failed to do a good enough job

893
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,296
Ammunition because it was really expensive

894
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:28,064
Back then

895
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:31,904
So they approve the eat bullet they used was used appropriate

896
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:33,952
To prove that each bullet

897
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:34,720
Kill a person

898
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:37,792
Cutting off the right hand of the deceased

899
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:41,888
Of course enterprising soldiers started to realize that if they did

900
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:44,704
Just cut off people's hands they could use the bolts for whatever they want

901
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,984
I'd like recreational shooting

902
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,056
Advise the scourge of bodily mutilation of Congolese

903
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:53,663
The practice got pretty out of control

904
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:54,943
Arbitrary bottle

905
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:55,711
Mute

906
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:57,503
At the hands of the ostensibly Christian

907
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:58,271
Colonialist

908
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,087
To the flavor

909
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:02,111
Use of rape as a method

910
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:03,391
Preparer login

911
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:05,695
Torture the burning Village the kidnapping

912
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:06,719
Children starving

913
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:07,743
All of that

914
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:10,047
Because of the Unspeakable horror he's

915
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:11,839
Subjected the Congolese people to

916
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:14,143
King Leopold Damascus staggering fortunate

917
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:16,191
100-500 million-dollar

918
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:18,751
Which is reportedly made him

919
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:22,079
What year did reportedly making it 1.2 richest

920
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:23,103
Person in the world

921
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:25,407
So I guess we are convinced the Christians

922
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:27,967
Pretty productive in Africa

923
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:30,015
Po-boy

924
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:34,367
Word gotten out about what Leopold was up to and he was forced to relinquish

925
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:35,391
Control over the colony

926
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:36,415
To the Belgian government

927
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:38,207
Ultimately however the Legacy

928
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:38,975
See if the Butcher of

929
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:40,255
The Congo has lived on

930
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:42,559
10 weeks after Congo declared its

931
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:43,583
Dependents for Belgium

932
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:44,607
Belgium

933
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:46,655
General Booth

Coletta coup d'etat

935
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:49,471
It took over the counter

936
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:50,495
Empower

937
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:51,519
Until a few months

938
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:52,543
Before his death in 90

939
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:58,943
Seco presided over one of the worst human-rights records ever routinely torturing and murdering political

940
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:01,247
Reportedly even feeding to tractors

941
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:02,015
The crocodiles

Purchase power

943
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:05,855
He'll be hard to draw parallel

944
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:07,647
2R the colonial days

945
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:08,671
Colonial

946
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:09,695
Pecos rule

947
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:10,719
Snowden

948
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:11,743
Have a habit of

949
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:13,023
Disfiguring the bodies of this

950
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:18,399
You know what I said that it would be hard to draw that parallel

951
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:20,447
I'll let the Chicago Tribune

952
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:23,775
Quote ma'buta's critics say that

953
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:27,103
Compression spring from the colonial history fits that an awful example

954
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:30,687
Among other atrocities the rulers of the former Belgian Congo use

955
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:31,711
Used to slice two hands

956
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:34,527
A rubber workers off if they were caught misbehaving

957
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:38,367
King Leopold The Butcher of the Congo was a Catholic

958
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:46,559
Started to criticizes murderous habits and you decided

959
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:50,655
So also you may remember that Paul manafort Rodger Stone

960
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:51,423
Professor Christian

961
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:54,239
Made a whole lot of money lobbying for in representing

962
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:58,591
This idea is a bunch of Illusion

963
00:43:59,359 --> 00:43:59,871
Alex wants

964
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:01,919
To portray world

965
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:02,687
Between the behavior

966
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:04,223
Christian does being civilized

967
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:08,063
Good behavior of Muslims is being barbaric brutal and destructive

968
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:10,111
And this is purely an expression of bigotry

969
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:13,695
There's plenty of examples of Muslims doing horrible things

970
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:15,231
History of Africa and elsewhere

971
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:19,327
But those horrible acts are no moral condemnation of the religion of Islam and it's a

972
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:20,607
As the actor

973
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:22,399
King Leopold our condemnation

974
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:26,495
Christianity and the vast majority of Christians who don't behave that way I don't think

975
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:29,055
What's Behind These atrocities

976
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:31,103
Is the lingering untreated consequences

977
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:32,383
Of a brutal racist

978
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:33,151
Dehumanizing

979
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:35,455
History of colonialism in Imperial

980
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:39,039
The Westin Alex fetishizes committed a crime

981
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:40,831
Against the native peoples of Africa

982
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:42,111
And plenty of other places

983
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:44,159
He's blaming the victims praja

984
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:45,183
Any for the afternoon

985
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:47,999
It's pathetic and childish way to view the world

986
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:49,791
And it's so incredibly important

987
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:50,815
Respect and understanding

988
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:51,839
The complexity of things

989
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:54,143
Like this

990
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:55,167
To make simple

991
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:57,471
It's hard to discuss delivery damages

992
00:44:57,727 --> 00:45:00,287
Pastors people in the third world today

993
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:01,823
And the lingering benefits

994
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:03,103
Of those damages

995
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:03,871
That the West has a

996
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:04,639
Enjoy

997
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:05,663
It's far easier to say

998
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:07,455
F*** it we're good they're bad

999
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:08,479
Because of Islam

1000
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:10,015
But you don't

1001
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:12,063
And it's absolutely

1002
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:14,623
Mirrored in

1003
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:15,903
The way that somebody

1004
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:17,951
People in America

1005
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:20,511
Well you're not welcome because you're not

1006
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:21,279
Working hard

1007
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:27,935
Not because we absolutely destroyed any possibility

1008
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:28,703
And then

1009
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:32,799
Situation

1010
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:33,823
And the fact

1011
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:34,591
He's using

1012
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:35,615
Play eats

1013
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:38,175
Immensely suspicious

1014
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:39,711
Even though

1015
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:42,271
Can't make this statement

1016
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:43,295
100%

1017
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:49,695
Asbury

1018
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:51,231
Important for me that

1019
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,279
Specifically went out of his way to

1020
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:54,559
Shoes African

1021
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:55,839
Etiwanda

1022
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:56,607
To make

1023
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:57,375
Comparison

1024
00:45:57,631 --> 00:45:58,143
Between

1025
00:45:58,655 --> 00:45:59,423
Christians and Muslims

1026
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:00,703
Because he's trying to

1027
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:03,519
His his phone

1028
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:04,543
Racism out of

1029
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:06,079
Because if you're going to

1030
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:11,199
Keeps all of it on full display

1031
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:15,039
You can't say oh well you know in America Christian verse

1032
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:16,063
Is Muslim because we are

1033
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:17,599
He's going to wind up doing

1034
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:23,743
Pause this expression colonialism

1035
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:27,583
Black people good or bad

1036
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:28,351
Essentially

1037
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:32,447
Black people in Africa didn't have or Africa

1038
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:34,495
Didn't have Christianity

1039
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:35,263
Was Brock

1040
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:36,287
Right so I guess

1041
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:39,103
It would be those who got

1042
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:39,871
Program

1043
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:42,175
We're good and those who

1044
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:47,551
Didn't our bags those who submitted to the colonialist missionary agenda

1045
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:56,511
Literally across

1046
00:46:56,767 --> 00:47:01,375
The entire world

1047
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:04,191
Bailed on it until they felt they needed some

1048
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:04,959
Something and then just

1049
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:08,287
Pakistan

1050
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:09,567
Perfectly normal

1051
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:14,175
Good stuff

1052
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:17,503
We know that Alex

1053
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:20,063
Individual

1054
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:21,343
Honey hates the globalist

1055
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:22,623
Because they are

1056
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:23,647
Their Collective

1057
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:27,231
Kind of

1058
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:28,255
There

1059
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:29,791
But it depends

1060
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:31,071
Interesting is that Alex

1061
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:32,863
Are we heard him Express similar things

1062
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:35,167
Before he's like actually collect

1063
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:36,959
I believe in the club

1064
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:39,519
Collectivism Collective

1065
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:42,079
Where's my Collective Collective

1066
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:44,895
Talk about that

1067
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:45,919
Pretty far off course

1068
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:48,991
I am the ultimate collector

1069
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:53,599
You want find a bigger collectivist on this planet that I was Jose

1070
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:09,727
Fire system

1071
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:13,567
I don't think so

1072
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:21,503
I'm not sure if those last words really made it feel like Alex thinks he's a Christ

1073
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:26,367
Of the Christ

1074
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:32,511
Why have you forsaken me

1075
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:40,191
Like my people go back on Twitter

1076
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:45,823
Really basically coops all like a Bible story that to Alex's

1077
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:49,151
Struggle to get back to the promised land of social media

1078
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:54,527
I think he does think there is some of that whether or not he would ever put it that way

1079
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:58,623
He's a messiah.

1080
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:07,839
And it keeps me from going on the internet and Fishes that's all the downloads

1081
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:12,447
The Joe Rogan podcast

1082
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:14,239
Possibility

1083
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:17,311
It's pretty packed up

1084
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:18,335
Express with Eli

1085
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:21,151
I'm a collectivist but also an individual as I think

1086
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:23,455
I think that is murky with definition

1087
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:24,735
Certainly but

1088
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:35,999
Harrison Smith

1089
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:41,375
And now that we know the plot of childhood

1090
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:46,495
Guess where this is coming from

1091
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:49,567
Spoiler alert

1092
00:49:53,919 --> 00:50:00,063
In history

1093
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:08,255
Scam

1094
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:10,303
The trash

1095
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:12,607
The good they can attach to the overmind

1096
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:14,655
They are the failures they're the scum

1097
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:20,799
Viruses

1098
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:32,319
Weapon

1099
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:47,679
Operating system with a crazed demoniac

1100
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:49,215
Garbage

1101
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:55,615
Daddy said damn the torpedoes

1102
00:50:55,871 --> 00:51:01,759
Who's around when the causing all kinds of problems

1103
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:03,295
Refused

1104
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:05,855
No thank you

1105
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:07,391
So you're shaming the dog

1106
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:08,671
Victor torpedo

1107
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:15,583
The other stuff they're like the idea that they are these demons are Fallen

1108
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:19,167
And that you know they can't

1109
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:20,191
And that's from

1110
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:24,031
Childhood's end

1111
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:26,335
The cost of

1112
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:28,383
Even show up

1113
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:29,663
That is also

1114
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:31,711
Directly from childhood's end

1115
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:34,527
The idea that we were having this weaponized space race

1116
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:38,367
And that's when the aliens stepped in because we were going to destroy ourselves

1117
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:40,415
Alex could read that if you like

1118
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:42,207
I don't know

1119
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:45,791
Invade their area we were about to become as great as them

1120
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:47,327
Stopped us from it

1121
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:49,887
As opposed to what's actually in the tax they were going

1122
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:50,655
We're going to

1123
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:51,423
Destroy ourselves

1124
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:53,727
And we were important to the overmind

1125
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:55,519
That we not destroy ourselves

1126
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:57,823
Pencil The Midwives came into a shirt

1127
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:58,847
That we don't destroy

1128
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:05,247
To make an argument about the real world

1129
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:06,271
Which is f***** up

1130
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:10,367
Although there is a part

1131
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:12,415
People that their Humanity

1132
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:13,439
For the Stars

1133
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:14,463
That sort of thing

1134
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:16,767
Like the idea that we are going to be making spaceships

1135
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:18,303
And traveling through space

1136
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:19,583
The Azar race

1137
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:21,887
Not in our future

1138
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:23,423
Our future is to

1139
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:26,751
Become one with the overmind

1140
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:33,151
The Congo we're not going to be an interesting way for it to go into

1141
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:35,967
Overmind

1142
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:39,551
Yeah I think that I think that Alex

1143
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:41,343
This is kind of mad the Corral and said that

1144
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:42,623
And that's weird

1145
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:44,159
Because that's in a book

1146
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:49,535
We have six months left until societal collapse

1147
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:52,863
He really talks

1148
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:57,471
I feel like it would be a lot of your show

1149
00:52:57,727 --> 00:52:59,263
He doesn't really stand on a 2 much buddy

1150
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:00,543
Touches on Tibetan

1151
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:06,431
Radio transmission

1152
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:10,527
God

1153
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:14,367
Right now to take everybody out

1154
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:27,167
Globalism

1155
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:36,639
The reason I kept going to collapse the planet

1156
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:40,479
I guess there's not really any more information about the 6-month time frame whatever

1157
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:42,527
What

1158
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:45,599
We did about the deposition

1159
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:47,135
I was very

1160
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:48,415
Specific to

1161
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:49,439
Like to find out

1162
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:51,231
The psychosis

1163
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:52,767
Headlines that are going

1164
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:54,303
I don't think I was wrong to do that

1165
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:55,327
However

1166
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:57,119
What is describing

1167
00:53:58,399 --> 00:53:59,679
Reported as psychosis

1168
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:00,959
He did use that word

1169
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:03,519
Is the idea that younger

1170
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:05,567
He distrusted the media so much but

1171
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:07,871
Thought everything they said was bad

1172
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:10,943
What do you saying In that clip is the exact same thing

1173
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:16,575
As he's old

1174
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:17,855
Then he's Learned was wrong

1175
00:54:18,111 --> 00:54:24,255
Now he's going out to do whatever

1176
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:25,279
That's not good

1177
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:29,375
What's up

1178
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:30,911
Still do but I used

1179
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:35,263
Wow

1180
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:37,823
I guess it's weird

1181
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:40,127
Be more careful

1182
00:54:40,383 --> 00:54:41,407
I don't know why I would

1183
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:43,967
Now

1184
00:54:44,223 --> 00:54:49,087
Quite a bit in the middle of

1185
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:51,903
Does this

1186
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:54,719
I think it means he's going to be on Rogan

1187
00:54:57,535 --> 00:55:00,607
Dammit quick succession

1188
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:02,655
Really annoyed

1189
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:04,703
I'm not sure if that is what

1190
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:06,239
But I think it is

1191
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:07,775
Cuz what else would he be

1192
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:09,567
And what else would it be hinting at

1193
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:12,127
Really disappointed

1194
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:13,919
Really it's a

1195
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:14,943
Such a bummer

1196
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:16,991
I don't like

1197
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:20,575
Joby

1198
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:22,111
Weird one-sided

1199
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:23,135
Friendship

1200
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:25,695
Getting used by the

1201
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:31,839
How much money is making office one-sided friendship and I think those feelings may go away a little bit

1202
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:36,191
Clout in that like a dumb

1203
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:37,215
World

00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:43,103
Absolutism

Except people who are actually pretty far lap

1208
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:53,855
It is gross but

1209
00:55:54,623 --> 00:55:56,415
You know she's talking about going to LA

1210
00:55:56,927 --> 00:55:58,719
Are you talkin about how

1211
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:05,119
How to set the clip out but I'll tell you that I don't believe it

1212
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:09,983

How much

1234
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:21,919
Protesting

1235
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:28,575
They'll give a s***

1236
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:30,367
I think that might be where they were

1237
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:33,439
A hard right pepitone it's ridiculous

1238
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:36,255
I was going to give a speech of Comedy Store

1239
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:37,279
No you can't do it

1240
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:41,631
So

1241
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:43,167
Going to give a comedy lesson

1242
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:44,703
Yeah I guess

00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:48,543
Doug Stanhope how much

1244
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:49,823
The Comedy Store exist

1245
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:54,431
Entity where there be interested in whatever speed she has

1246
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:56,735
I don't know

1247
00:57:56,991 --> 00:57:57,503
Who cares

1248
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:01,599
Weird

1249
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:04,159
I guess

1250
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:05,439
I don't know

1251
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:08,255
He's talking about his Sandy Hook lawsuit

1252
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:11,839
I'm stuffy head with his lawyer

1253
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:13,119
It's very important

1254
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:13,887
That out

1255
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:16,191
Because at the beginning of the clip he does say that this is

1256
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:17,471
His lawyers

1257
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:18,751
Not other lawyer

1258
00:58:21,055 --> 00:58:21,823
From other lawyers

1259
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:24,639
His lawyer saying this to him

1260
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:26,943
It's very weird

1261
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:28,735
No I bet they are

1262
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:35,903
There's no way you find yourself give me the Mercer

1263
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:39,999
Commercials got a dollar

1264
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:43,071
It's okay I know you get the money from him just give it to me

1265
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:45,119
Why because

1266
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:48,703
Gentlemen's bar

1267
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:54,079
Never built a damn thing in their lives

1268
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:59,199
Crazy jumps operation

1269
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:01,759
Rebuilt

1270
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:10,207
Hours

1271
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:13,023
Wait till his lawyers asked him

1272
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:14,815
Where the Mercer money was

1273
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:21,215
His lawyers his lawyer said there's no way that you're funding yourself with

1274
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:22,751
This pill sale bulshit

1275
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:25,055
Where's the money coming from

1276
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:26,079
It's okay

1277
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:31,967
We're trying to defend you just need to know what's going on you have attorney-client privilege

1278
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:37,599
We just you can't lie to us or else we can't offend you that sort of thing and then I was like

1279
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:38,367
And the reason is

1280
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:44,767
Because the laughter children

1281
00:59:54,751 --> 01:00:00,895
I believe you probably might not be the Mercer specifically but the fact that his own lawyers are like this doesn't add up

1282
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:01,663
What what

1283
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:03,455
The deal makes me think

1284
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:07,551
Hey Alex according to your

1285
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:08,831
Revenue

1286
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:10,111
Profit loss

1287
01:00:10,879 --> 01:00:11,391
You lost

1288
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:13,439
$3000000

1289
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:17,023
It looks like you

1290
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:19,071
Even doubt and are in the blue

1291
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:21,375
Now this business

01:00:22,655 --> 01:00:23,167
And I'm going to use

1293
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:24,447

Tails

1296
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:28,799

Like

1300
01:00:41,343 --> 01:00:44,159
You've never built anything

1301
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:46,719
Did you

1302
01:00:47,231 --> 01:00:49,791
Yeah with the merciful

1303
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:52,351
My dad's oil money

1304
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:57,727
Successful and it's not just because he's

1305
01:00:57,983 --> 01:00:58,495
He's great

1306
01:00:58,751 --> 01:00:59,519
There's actually reasons

1307
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:03,359
How many does a Ric Flair impression

1308
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:09,759
Which is great because we recording this before I watch WrestleMania this evening

1309
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:11,551
Ric Flair

1310
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:17,951
You're looking at expression of the will of humanity

1311
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:37,151
Because I'm not a knuckle Dragon low IQ

1312
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:51,999
Bad wolves

1313
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:55,327
He's created his own

1314
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:58,143
Which is not really

1315
01:01:58,399 --> 01:02:00,959
Kohl's on other people selling them

1316
01:02:01,215 --> 01:02:01,727
To your idiot

1317
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:08,383

Great

1319
01:02:09,663 --> 01:02:11,967
But I guess we are knuckle dragger

1320
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:13,503
Cuz we don't sell

1321
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:23,231
We should

1322
01:02:23,999 --> 01:02:27,071
That's right biggest sexual organ

1323
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:29,887
Branson

1324
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:35,519
So I was just bragging about how you've got to

1325
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:37,567
Feeds to other news organization

1326
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:43,711
What is that DirecTV like

1327
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:48,575
Just trying to brag that other news organizations

1328
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:50,367
But he was

1329
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:51,135
During the break

1330
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:52,159
He was watching

1331
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:53,183
Fox News

1332
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:54,463
Any sauce

1333
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:56,767
Make a theory Theory

1334
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:58,303
About what Trump is doing with the

1335
01:02:58,559 --> 01:02:59,071
The Border

1336
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:07,519
Collab

1337
01:03:08,031 --> 01:03:14,175
Overwhelmed

1338
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:19,807
Open

1339
01:03:21,087 --> 01:03:21,855
Come up here

1340
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:24,671
But it's all just a PR stunt

1341
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:25,695
Dumb

1342
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:27,743
Because the Border

1343
01:03:37,215 --> 01:03:43,359
Unless you put major pressure on the Mexican Government right now stop this it's done the country is broken

1344
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:45,663
I think that's for 6 months

1345
01:03:45,919 --> 01:03:47,967
He's talking about

1346
01:04:02,303 --> 01:04:06,143
Countries in Europe in the US and Australia

1347
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:15,871
Welfare

1348
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:18,431
Laundry

1349
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:25,599
Almost all of them are conscious criminals

1350
01:04:29,439 --> 01:04:30,463
Bright movie

1351
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:35,071
Bell

1352
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:36,607
Sanchez

1353
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:50,687
Everything goes back to some Syfy reference that may or may not be like

1354
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:54,015
Actually related at all

1355
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:56,831
Because he's got nothing

1356
01:04:57,343 --> 01:05:02,463
He can ramble about the idea that there is a reference to

1357
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:05,023
Paxton we can't remember his name

1358
01:05:06,047 --> 01:05:07,327
That's it that's all he has

1359
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:08,607
This is this is

1360
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:09,887
Exactly

1361
01:05:10,399 --> 01:05:10,911
Like

1362
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:11,935
Childhood's end

1363
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:13,983
Being behind his conception of the

1364
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:15,519
Entities that are behind

1365
01:05:15,775 --> 01:05:16,799
That the globalist

1366
01:05:17,055 --> 01:05:19,103
These demon he's hiding demon

1367
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:20,639
Alien figures that

1368
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:24,735
Good but are actually here to destroy the world

1369
01:05:24,991 --> 01:05:25,503
It's all

1370
01:05:25,759 --> 01:05:26,271
Bulshit

1371
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:27,295
All of it

1372
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:28,063
Just goes back to

1373
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:29,855
Not understanding

1374
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:30,623
The difference

1375
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:31,903
In reality

1376
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:33,951
Assuming that

1377
01:05:34,207 --> 01:05:35,487
All fiction

1378
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:38,815
Is just reality presented as fiction

1379
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:40,351
Lesser Magic

1380
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:43,423
Nice if

1381
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:44,959
He just if we just found out that he

1382
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:47,775
Because I

1383
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:51,359
Better if you just go through all of the natural

1384
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:53,407
Disasters in all Paxton movies

1385
01:05:53,663 --> 01:05:55,711
Just likes and you know how they're going to do it

1386
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:59,295
Better music

1387
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:03,135
John Paxton Sam talks about basketball all the time

1388
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:04,671
Bway lower

1389
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:07,999
So another indication

1390
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:09,535
All this stuff is

1391
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:13,375
Just based on faulty sources that he's pretending or much

1392
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:15,167
More serious than they are

1393
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:17,727
Like a f*** you out

1394
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:18,751
Get the f*** out of here

1395
01:06:19,263 --> 01:06:24,127
But then again earlier we're talkin about all the childhood

1396
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:25,663
And then we're reminded

1397
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:27,199
The stuff that is important

1398
01:06:27,455 --> 01:06:28,991
I'm talking about these differences between

1399
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:31,295
Christian Africans and Muslim African

1400
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:32,575
Again

1401
01:06:33,087 --> 01:06:39,231
This last clip you talkin about all this vun plan to break up countries and we got to bring troops to the border and it's just

1402
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:42,559
Like alien the movie

1403
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:44,607
You just alright whatever Alex

1404
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:46,911
And it leads to like this

1405
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:51,775
Women

1406
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:55,359
Horor

1407
01:06:57,407 --> 01:06:59,199
Smirnoff

1408
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:15,071
A country clitoris is off when they're born

1409
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:23,519
You got the members of Islam two of them

1410
01:07:32,735 --> 01:07:36,063
So Alex said in my last clip

1411
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:38,367
And then brings up Omar enslaved

1412
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:41,951
There is a third

1413
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:43,487
Figure that he's met

1414
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:44,767
With the women's March

1415
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:47,327
Play surfer premium unleaded

1416
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:48,607
Islam

1417
01:07:48,863 --> 01:07:54,751
Sure distance

1418
01:07:55,007 --> 01:07:56,031
Thursday last week

1419
01:07:56,543 --> 01:08:00,639
On Friday of last week fifty-five-year-old Patrick Carly carlineo

1420
01:08:00,895 --> 01:08:04,223
Was arrested after he called el on Omar's office and threatened to kill her

1421
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:07,039
He reached a staffer who he asked quote

1422
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:08,575
For her she's a f****** Terror

1423
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:10,111
He went on to promise

1424
01:08:10,623 --> 01:08:11,391
Quote put a bullet

1425
01:08:11,647 --> 01:08:12,415
And her f****** skull

1426
01:08:12,927 --> 01:08:14,975
When he was arrested he told the police that he love Trump

1427
01:08:15,231 --> 01:08:18,559
Quote hates radical Islam radical Muslims in

1428
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:21,887
The next day after the man's arrest

1429
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:23,935
In Vegas for the Republican Jewish coalition

1430
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:25,215
Where you said quote

1431
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:28,031
Special thanks to representative Omar of Minnesota

1432
01:08:28,287 --> 01:08:30,079
Oh I forgot she doesn't like Israel

1433
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:33,151
I forgot I'm so sorry no she doesn't like his real does she

1434
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:34,431
Please I apologize

1435
01:08:35,455 --> 01:08:40,575
Trump donor Sheldon Adelson was in attendance where he wore red yamaka with the word Trump on it

1436
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:44,415
Call Netanyahu your prime minister

1437
01:08:44,671 --> 01:08:48,511
Despite the attendees being American Republicans who happened to be Jewish

1438
01:08:48,767 --> 01:08:51,839
Richmond

1439
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:53,375
Omar's

1440
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:54,143
For saying

1441
01:08:54,655 --> 01:08:56,703
Pure and simple there's no two ways about this

1442
01:08:56,959 --> 01:08:59,263
These people are trying to get representative Omar killed

1443
01:09:00,543 --> 01:09:01,055
Disgraceful

1444
01:09:01,567 --> 01:09:03,103
Alex

1445
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:05,663
I talked about that game

1446
01:09:05,919 --> 01:09:07,967
How do I store sells again

1447
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:08,735
Cowboy

1448
01:09:09,247 --> 01:09:13,855
I told you I was in Isla Mujeres Mexico

1449
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:18,975
Watch for 3 days

1450
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:24,351
Get away from me

1451
01:09:29,215 --> 01:09:32,287
Guaranteed

1452
01:09:33,055 --> 01:09:37,919
Sure

1453
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:46,879
So Muslim

1454
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:53,023
All Muslims are as guilty of everybody

1455
01:09:53,535 --> 01:09:54,303
They're usurpers

1456
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:55,071
They're just

1457
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:55,839
Destroyer

1458
01:09:56,351 --> 01:09:57,375
They're coming to

1459
01:09:57,887 --> 01:10:00,703
Destroyed freedoms of Western Civilization

1460
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:03,007
This is just disgusting

1461
01:10:03,519 --> 01:10:04,799
This is there's no other way to put it

1462
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:06,335
Repulsive

1463
01:10:06,591 --> 01:10:07,103
Rhetoric

1464
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:10,175
That's the sort of thing that only only

1465
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:11,199
Leeds

1466
01:10:11,711 --> 01:10:12,223
People being

1467
01:10:18,111 --> 01:10:20,927
Almost it is

1468
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:22,207
Positive empathy

1469
01:10:23,487 --> 01:10:23,999
Betrayal

1470
01:10:24,255 --> 01:10:24,767
Like

1471
01:10:25,023 --> 01:10:26,303
If the stories

1472
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:27,839
Presenting

1473
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:28,607
True

1474
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:30,655
Based on what he's even talking about right

1475
01:10:30,911 --> 01:10:31,423
Right now

1476
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:33,215
What happened was

1477
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:37,055
Some gay guys apologize

1478
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:41,919
Over trying to hang out with the Muslim people

1479
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:46,783
Didn't want to hang out hang out

1480
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:56,255
Usurpers other than outright anger and and

1481
01:10:57,279 --> 01:10:59,583
Is the wrong way to

1482
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:03,167
Any interaction with Muslims

1483
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:04,959
Because what you're

1484
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:08,543
From Alex's reflective

1485
01:11:13,151 --> 01:11:13,663
It's it's

1486
01:11:15,455 --> 01:11:18,015
Destructive of any kind of like

1487
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:20,063
Light

1488
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:21,855
Right

1489
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:22,623
That away for

1490
01:11:24,415 --> 01:11:25,951
Yeah it's a it's a

1491
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:27,743
Disgusting worldview

1492
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:31,583
Great Lake

1493
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:33,119
It's the sort of thing that you need

1494
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:34,911
To do in order to make people not

1495
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:36,447
Fuel for a group of

1496
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:40,031
Pretty bad exactly

1497
01:11:40,543 --> 01:11:44,383
So are we won last year

1498
01:11:44,639 --> 01:11:50,015
About an hour of the episode Alex talks to his lawyer

1499
01:11:50,271 --> 01:11:55,391
Barnes good work Barnes and

1500
01:11:55,647 --> 01:11:58,463
Is just agreeing with Alex and talking about how like

1501
01:11:58,975 --> 01:12:00,511
This case they wear in right now

1502
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:02,047
Is going to be

1503
01:12:04,351 --> 01:12:05,119
Free speech

1504
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:07,167
We are going to take it all the way

1505
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:09,471
Court and

1506
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:13,567
Yeah there

1507
01:12:13,823 --> 01:12:14,847
Yeah we're going to need to take

1508
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:17,663
This case it's an indication do of like

1509
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:20,223
You know that you can't argue this case on the Merritt

1510
01:12:20,735 --> 01:12:21,759
You can only win

1511
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:23,295
Theoretically

1512
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:24,575
If you twist it

1513
01:12:24,831 --> 01:12:25,599
Into being

1514
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:27,135
Some sort of a

1515
01:12:27,391 --> 01:12:28,671
Case about

1516
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:29,951
Speech itself

1517
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:33,023
And unfortunately there's already legal precedent

1518
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:39,423
The covers all of the issues that they would bring up

1519
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:42,495
You about like

1520
01:12:43,007 --> 01:12:44,031
You can't say that

1521
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:45,567
He didn't say these things

1522
01:12:45,823 --> 01:12:47,103
About the San Diego family

1523
01:12:48,383 --> 01:12:49,151
I don't understand

1524
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:50,943
Quite honestly why he's not just like

1525
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:52,223
Yep I said that

1526
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:53,759
It's beyond the statute of

1527
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:58,367
Or something like that

1528
01:12:58,879 --> 01:13:00,927
Probably because right now

1529
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:03,231
If we're talking about

1530
01:13:03,487 --> 01:13:05,791
Even go on the

1531
01:13:06,047 --> 01:13:06,559
The show

1532
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:08,095
If not

1533
01:13:08,607 --> 01:13:09,631
Some sort of

1534
01:13:10,143 --> 01:13:11,167
Meant to other people

1535
01:13:12,447 --> 01:13:17,055
Yeah probably Barnes to go on it

1536
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:18,335
No

1537
01:13:18,591 --> 01:13:20,639
So it goes on Infowars and

1538
01:13:20,895 --> 01:13:23,455
He doesn't have some sort of raw like

1539
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:27,807
Defense

1540
01:13:28,063 --> 01:13:31,391
I'm going to I'm going to

1541
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:40,863
We got a class action lawsuit

1542
01:13:44,447 --> 01:13:47,007
Yeah it was

1543
01:13:48,543 --> 01:13:50,591
We can still talk about it a little bit

1544
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:51,615
I cannot stand

1545
01:13:53,151 --> 01:13:53,919
Understand

1546
01:13:54,175 --> 01:13:54,687
The windscreen

1547
01:13:54,943 --> 01:13:56,479
Okay every single

1548
01:13:56,991 --> 01:14:02,111
Stansbury says as follows

1549
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:07,999
Inhales are brutal it sounds

1550
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:10,303
So terrible that it triggers me

1551
01:14:10,559 --> 01:14:13,375
Excel like Iowa City

1552
01:14:16,703 --> 01:14:17,983
We record

1553
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:21,567
Apartment on Sennheiser bikes that I paid

1554
01:14:21,823 --> 01:14:23,103
$75 for

1555
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:24,639
5 years ago

1556
01:14:24,895 --> 01:14:27,455
Still somehow isn't is obnoxious to listen to

1557
01:14:27,711 --> 01:14:30,015
As a millionaire attorney

1558
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:32,575
In Alex Jones is a billion-dollar Studio

1559
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:35,391
And just like I was listening to I can't

1560
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:41,023
I love the idea of reverse ASMR videos

1561
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:41,791
Like

1562
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:45,119
Set of those relaxing

1563
01:14:46,143 --> 01:14:46,655
Right

1564
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:52,543
Just gets me to turn it off that's all it does

1565
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:57,151
I'm so a last clip Alex talks about how use liberals

1566
01:14:57,919 --> 01:14:59,199
But something changed

1567
01:15:04,063 --> 01:15:07,903
I wouldn't call myself I wouldn't even call myself a liberal

1568
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:13,279
I was just americanah libertarian

1569
01:15:13,791 --> 01:15:16,351
Americana common sense

1570
01:15:17,119 --> 01:15:19,935
Launch obama.in

1571
01:15:26,847 --> 01:15:29,919
So something changed when Obama got in

1572
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:32,223
Could you be a little less on the nose

1573
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:38,623
Could you be could you be around could you just be like oh is around 2016

1574
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:40,927
Never Hillary

1575
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:46,303
Isn't defining a

1576
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:49,887
What's the problem

1577
01:15:50,911 --> 01:15:52,447
It was argument that he was trying to make

1578
01:15:52,703 --> 01:15:55,775
Was this like during Obama's term Democrats

1579
01:15:56,031 --> 01:15:58,079
Complacent turned a blind eye to a lot of things

1580
01:15:58,591 --> 01:15:59,615
Push back against

1581
01:16:02,431 --> 01:16:04,991
There was room for a robust conversation

1582
01:16:05,247 --> 01:16:06,015
In what he was bringing

1583
01:16:07,295 --> 01:16:08,319
That's not what Alex is saying

1584
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:12,927
He said what he turned on liberals

1585
01:16:13,183 --> 01:16:14,463
Becoming more pro-war than

1586
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:15,231
Republican

1587
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:17,535
And the numbers just don't back that up

1588
01:16:18,303 --> 01:16:20,607
Princeton 2011 studies

1589
01:16:20,863 --> 01:16:24,191
The Pew Research Center a spondon said they favored the complete removal of Truth

1590
01:16:24,447 --> 01:16:24,959
Math games

1591
01:16:25,983 --> 01:16:29,311
67% of Democrats were in favor of the removal of troops as compared to

1592
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:30,079
243 purse

1593
01:16:30,591 --> 01:16:31,103
Republicans

1594
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:36,223
This study is great because it actually has a rebuttal for Alex's likely like first objection

1595
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:38,271
Tibetan is I'm not really a Republican

1596
01:16:38,783 --> 01:16:41,343
They're the research included a variable for tea party

1597
01:16:41,599 --> 01:16:46,719
Freefolk

1598
01:16:46,975 --> 01:16:47,999
With 42%

1599
01:16:48,255 --> 01:16:49,023
That only being in favor

1600
01:16:49,535 --> 01:16:50,303
After removal

1601
01:16:51,071 --> 01:16:57,215
The study has a few other questions in it like whether or not the respondents thought that quote using military force in Afghanistan was the right

1602
01:16:57,471 --> 01:16:57,983
Decision

1603
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:00,287
54% of Democrats said it was

1604
01:17:00,543 --> 01:17:01,055
Comparison

1605
01:17:01,311 --> 01:17:02,079
68% of

1606
01:17:02,335 --> 01:17:03,103
Republican

1607
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:04,383
So even that

1608
01:17:04,639 --> 01:17:05,151
Doesn't match

1609
01:17:05,919 --> 01:17:10,015
In September 2009 Gallup poll looking at the opinions of Obama's proposals

1610
01:17:10,271 --> 01:17:11,039
Send more troops

1611
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:11,807
And Afghan

1612
01:17:12,575 --> 01:17:13,855
63% of Republicans

1613
01:17:14,111 --> 01:17:15,135
Favored sending more

1614
01:17:15,647 --> 01:17:16,671
Where is 6

1615
01:17:16,927 --> 01:17:17,439
Supercenter

1616
01:17:17,695 --> 01:17:19,231
Opposed

1617
01:17:20,255 --> 01:17:21,279
So broken

1618
01:17:21,535 --> 01:17:26,143
Widely more in favor as a 2009-2011

1619
01:17:26,655 --> 01:17:29,983
A November 2015 Gallup poll asked respondents

1620
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:34,079
Respondents supported sending ground troops to Iraq and Syria

1621
01:17:34,847 --> 01:17:36,639
56% of Republicans were in Pavers

1622
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:38,943
As opposed to 37% of

1623
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:40,479
So that doesn't

1624
01:17:42,527 --> 01:17:44,575
2011 Gallup poll

1625
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:47,135
Approved a military action in Libya

1626
01:17:47,903 --> 01:17:50,975
51% of Democrats

1627
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:53,791
The number was still lower than the 57% of Republican

1628
01:17:55,327 --> 01:18:01,471
What made exceptions I can find is a September 2013 Gallup poll which asked about support for a military strike again

1629
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:05,311
In this instance 45% of Democrats were in favor

1630
01:18:05,567 --> 01:18:07,359
Compared to only 31% of

1631
01:18:08,127 --> 01:18:10,431
It's interesting that this is the one instance where Republicans

1632
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:12,991
Pretty clearly anti-war as compared to Democrats

1633
01:18:13,759 --> 01:18:14,783
Every sure that there's a

1634
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:17,599
Cool reason for that I don't know exactly what it is

1635
01:18:17,855 --> 01:18:18,623
There's got to be something

1636
01:18:19,135 --> 01:18:20,671
Adam kind of fun fact reason

1637
01:18:20,927 --> 01:18:25,535
Yeah that's for the Democratic support for the war if you want to call 45%

1638
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:26,303
Like outright

1639
01:18:26,559 --> 01:18:27,071
Support for it

1640
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:28,351
Find alarm

1641
01:18:29,375 --> 01:18:30,655
But if you're looking for an explanation

1642
01:18:30,911 --> 01:18:31,423
I think there's a

1643
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:32,191
Prickly reasonable

1644
01:18:33,983 --> 01:18:35,519
Seeking Congressional approval

1645
01:18:36,799 --> 01:18:37,567
As opposed to just

1646
01:18:37,823 --> 01:18:38,335
Attacking

1647
01:18:38,591 --> 01:18:40,895
Saying quote well I believe I have the authority to

1648
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:42,175
Carry out this military action

1649
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:43,199
Without specific

1650
01:18:43,455 --> 01:18:43,967
Congressional author

1651
01:18:44,223 --> 01:18:44,735
Authorization

1652
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:49,343
I know that the country will be stronger if we take this course and our actions will be even more effective

1653
01:18:50,111 --> 01:18:52,415
At the time of the Gallup poll the Senate Foreign Relations

1654
01:18:52,671 --> 01:18:54,463
Comedian passed a resolution authorizing

1655
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:55,231
The strike

1656
01:18:55,743 --> 01:18:56,255
Interior

1657
01:18:56,767 --> 01:18:57,535
It seems to me

1658
01:18:57,791 --> 01:18:58,559
The higher poll numbers

1659
01:18:58,815 --> 01:19:00,095
This attack among Democrats

1660
01:19:00,351 --> 01:19:01,887
Is less indicative of a supportive

1661
01:19:02,143 --> 01:19:03,423
War and More in education

1662
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:06,495
I felt that this was being handled in the appropriate way

1663
01:19:07,007 --> 01:19:09,567
As you can see from the 2015 poll I stated earlier

1664
01:19:09,823 --> 01:19:13,407
The Democratic support for a war in Syria was very short-lived

1665
01:19:13,663 --> 01:19:14,431
And it turned around

1666
01:19:14,943 --> 01:19:16,735
As was the Republican opposition

1667
01:19:17,759 --> 01:19:19,039
I was just making s*** up here

1668
01:19:21,087 --> 01:19:22,879
It's just his way of not saying

1669
01:19:23,647 --> 01:19:26,207
I got really freaked out by the Obama becoming president

1670
01:19:26,463 --> 01:19:28,767
You you come up with a different way to present it

1671
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:31,327
Democrats became pro-war

1672
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:34,143
The numbers don't really match that

1673
01:19:34,655 --> 01:19:39,007
You could have a different conversation that is similar to that about Obama

1674
01:19:39,263 --> 01:19:39,775
Policies

1675
01:19:40,031 --> 01:19:40,799
But you don't want to do that

1676
01:19:41,311 --> 01:19:42,335
You want to

1677
01:19:43,103 --> 01:19:43,615
Say that every

1678
01:19:45,151 --> 01:19:47,199
One that happened without saying we had a black

1679
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:49,759
So

1680
01:19:52,063 --> 01:19:53,855
I mean that's kind of

1681
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:55,903
Ord

1682
01:19:57,951 --> 01:20:00,255
If you don't want to

1683
01:20:01,535 --> 01:20:02,047
For the better

1684
01:20:02,815 --> 01:20:03,327
Because this one

1685
01:20:03,839 --> 01:20:05,119
Right well that's that's

1686
01:20:09,727 --> 01:20:10,751
That's a present

1687
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:12,799
A zit

1688
01:20:13,055 --> 01:20:18,944
Who are also why I'm willing to make the

1689
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:23,296
Absurd of default

1690
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:24,320
Another one you tell me

1691
01:20:24,576 --> 01:20:25,344
Your your argument

1692
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:26,112
You look at it

1693
01:20:27,392 --> 01:20:28,672
So I'm going to fall back to

1694
01:20:29,952 --> 01:20:35,072
How old is my president

1695
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:39,680
You give me something exactly can give me these

1696
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:40,960
You know

1697
01:20:41,216 --> 01:20:41,728
Pro-war

1698
01:20:41,984 --> 01:20:44,032
You can give me that right now look at

1699
01:20:44,544 --> 01:20:46,336
Because it doesn't make

1700
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:48,896
Want to give me something that does make sense

1701
01:20:49,664 --> 01:20:51,456
I'll stop assuming that it's black president

1702
01:20:51,968 --> 01:20:52,480
That's where I'm at

1703
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:55,040
So we come to the end of this Jordan and

1704
01:20:56,832 --> 01:20:57,344
Thrilled

1705
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:01,184
To have learned that most of Alex's just come from

1706
01:21:01,696 --> 01:21:04,000
I'm not thrilled about the where it leads him

1707
01:21:04,256 --> 01:21:06,048
In terms of his rhetoric about non-white

1708
01:21:06,304 --> 01:21:08,864
Population non-Christian population

1709
01:21:11,168 --> 01:21:12,192
Behind disbelief

1710
01:21:12,448 --> 01:21:13,216
You f***** up

1711
01:21:16,032 --> 01:21:18,592
Like that is if that existed without the

1712
01:21:18,848 --> 01:21:20,640
Really dangerous scary stuff

1713
01:21:21,152 --> 01:21:27,296
I think we would have a much more fun show Unity Project Camelot episodes all day

1714
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:32,416
And I understand I told you up front of the episode that

1715
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:34,208
I wanted to make this

1716
01:21:34,464 --> 01:21:36,000
April 4th

1717
01:21:36,256 --> 01:21:37,792
I wanted to cover Thursday and Friday

1718
01:21:38,048 --> 01:21:39,328
But I didn't have enough time

1719
01:21:39,584 --> 01:21:40,352
Because of

1720
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:42,400
A big episode

1721
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:44,448
And I don't like I'm looking at the time

1722
01:21:44,704 --> 01:21:45,216
I don't think it's

1723
01:21:45,472 --> 01:21:45,984
The super long at the

1724
01:21:46,752 --> 01:21:49,312
Vallarta

1725
01:21:49,824 --> 01:21:53,664
I had to read childhood's end

1726
01:21:54,432 --> 01:21:58,528
For what I mean by I didn't have the time

1727
01:21:58,784 --> 01:21:59,296
Yeah yeah

1728
01:21:59,808 --> 01:22:03,904
That was my home behind like 10 minutes

1729
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:06,464
Varsho was me reading a 200

1730
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:09,792
Open Facebook that's why I Friday had to

1731
01:22:10,048 --> 01:22:10,560
Do I take a

1732
01:22:10,816 --> 01:22:11,328
Baxley

1733
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:14,144
Yeah and if you like that's the other day

1734
01:22:14,656 --> 01:22:17,984
If you're basing your worldview on Syfy

1735
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:18,752
But

1736
01:22:20,544 --> 01:22:21,824
From the fifties

1737
01:22:22,592 --> 01:22:24,128
Just on account of

1738
01:22:24,384 --> 01:22:27,456
Undertones behind the Sci-Fi of the 50s

1739
01:22:30,016 --> 01:22:36,160
I didn't get out of that from childhood

1740
01:22:36,416 --> 01:22:42,304
It's from childhood childhoods a little bit

1741
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:43,840
Sri Lanka because he was secretly

1742
01:22:44,096 --> 01:22:46,400
League a band it was much better

1743
01:22:46,656 --> 01:22:48,704
Environment

1744
01:22:49,216 --> 01:22:49,984
5/4 DS

1745
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:51,008
Forgave

1746
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:56,640
I don't think there's a blatant bigotry in his work is

1747
01:22:58,944 --> 01:23:00,480
Something like that

1748
01:23:00,992 --> 01:23:05,088
With your premise just not applied

1749
01:23:05,344 --> 01:23:07,648
To Tropical

1750
01:23:07,904 --> 01:23:09,184
But I just need to unnecessarily.

1751
01:23:10,464 --> 01:23:13,024
So we get to the end

1752
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:15,584
Will the background

1753
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:21,984
Next episode of website

1754
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:23,008
Underscore fight

1755
01:23:23,264 --> 01:23:24,800
Jordan Burroughs

1756

Route to you

1757
01:23:32,992 --> 01:23:34,016

1758
01:23:34,528 --> 01:23:35,040
Rate reviews

1759
01:23:35,296 --> 01:23:35,808
Stribog

1760
01:23:36,064 --> 01:23:38,624
Stop please do

1761
01:23:39,136 --> 01:23:39,648
We bounced out

1762
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:41,696
And I'll say

1763
01:23:45,024 --> 01:23:45,536
The overlord

1764
01:23:47,072 --> 01:23:48,864
Never killed anybody

1765
01:23:49,376 --> 01:23:50,144
Anybody in the book

1766
01:23:50,656 --> 01:23:56,800
Looks like a demon

1767
01:23:57,056 --> 01:24:03,200
From an evolutionary standpoint what are you doing with the UN secretary-general

1768
01:24:03,456 --> 01:24:04,992
Ricky storm or whatever

1769
01:24:05,248 --> 01:24:07,296
Some clothes to match

1770
01:24:10,368 --> 01:24:11,136
Alex

1771
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:14,208
Holding

1772
01:24:16,256 --> 01:24:19,840
