1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Damn important

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect but knowledge B I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

3
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:39,936
Need

4
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

5
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,136
Dot-com

6
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:08,096
We are Damned

7
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,008
My bright spot my dear boy is second chances

8
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:23,712
Sorry I wasn't I wasn't expecting the Foghorn Leghorn

9
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:25,504
Play a famous Barber

10
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,784
Spot is

11
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:29,088
Second Chances

12
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:34,464
So a while back excited about the release of Hyrule Warriors

13
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:38,304
Calamity

14
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,704
Dynasty Warriors Style game with a Legend of Zelda characters I'm notoriously big fan

15
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,728
Hyrule Warriors

16
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,264
Original

17
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,312
And I was

18
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:54,944
Wrongly disappointed by age of Calamity that was when it was released

19
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,760
And I put it down cuz I like

20
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:58,784
God isn't

21
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,088
Scratching the itch I wanted to scratch

22
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:07,232
And I gave it some thought and excited as I thought it was

23
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:09,536
To play a little bit of

24
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:10,560
Abso

25
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:12,864
My bright spot is vetted

26
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:18,496
Fair amount of fun gameplay in there that I did not give a fair Shake

27
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:20,800
I'm going to get out of the mine

28
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,616
Gottman

29
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,384
I like this

30
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,200
I like this bright spot weird trading off

31
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:31,552
Similar bright spots here for me it's not Second Chances

32
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:33,600
For me it's my 45th

33
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:34,624
Where is 6th Street

34
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,744
You know I vote we have talked about the Games Done Quick

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,376
Taking the pass yes I well there was a recent one done by the

36
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:48,192
Organisers of Games Done Quick but it was all women

37
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:51,008
Call frame Fatale I think or whatever it is

38
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:51,776
Who's in

39
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:52,800
Credibly inclusa

40
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:53,568
Like

41
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,104
Super is great

42
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,128
It's fantastic

43
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:00,480
Somebody was playing Final Fantasy Tactics

44
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:01,504
Text my friend

45
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,040
And I had to

46
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,064
Get back up

47
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:10,464
Yeah because this is my 47 or 48 play through I'm on 50 or 60 playthroughs completed

48
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:16,864
This is one of the greatest games and here's what's going to happen whenever you bring up a

49
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:23,264
Game like this it's like when you bring up the wires right right right buddy who knows it's like everybody in the internet is going to go

50
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:25,312
Oh man Final Fantasy Tactics

51
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:27,872
Great and then somebody's going to go like I've never played it

52
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,664
And everybody's going to pile on my

53
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,480
See you in a week

54
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:34,272
Exactly

55
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:36,064
Skewer references throw knife

56
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,392
For me I think might be

57
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:41,440
I don't know trying to think of like what if I played

58
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:43,488
Excessive amount of time

59
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:46,816
And I think it's got to be like one of the Pikmin games

60
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:48,608
You think so I played those

61
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:52,704
A lot of beating them and played them through too I don't know why that came is very Charming

62
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,472
Sing for me

63
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:55,008
Then maybe a turtle turkey

64
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:57,056
I have a playdate

65
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,336
Years and years

66
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,616
Definitely Beat It

67
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:01,152
A lot of

68
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:06,016
No I mean it's one of those games and nobody went what was it you know you played

69
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:06,784
Uplay

70
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:09,088
Games before you know like maybe

71
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,112
Better

72
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:12,416
I mean it's like a aboard

73
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:15,488
Structure you know like a combat situation of realization

74
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,280
A little bit like that but not

75
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,071
Hexagonal

76
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,375
Regular it's Square

77
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,655
Rectangular

78
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:27,007
Is it does it play out like a RPG like a standard RPG

79
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:30,335
Luke turns it plays out more like a chess game

80
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:36,991
You know you have these characters who can move in certain ways and do certain

81
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:37,759
Same order

82
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:40,575
Different and then you figure out a way to get to QuikTrip

83
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:42,879
It's a little bit like that I mean it's hard

84
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:43,903
Explain button

85
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:48,767
I've talked to people who have never played another game it's similar to this at all

86
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:52,607
It's the only type that doesn't sound wildly familiar to

87
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:59,007
Absorbed into your nonsense world

88
00:04:59,263 --> 00:04:59,775
Alright

89
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:00,543
Well

90
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:06,943
Absorb me from this nonsense World hey how you doing

91
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,991
Tune of doing a Wednesday episode

92
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:15,135
Raring to go give him the last couple modern-day episodes

93
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:17,951
There was something worth it

94
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:22,047
We're all going to die goodbye my dear friend

95
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:28,447
Smash cut to

96
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,543
It was a

97
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,311
Troubling

98
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,335
Little chef

99
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:40,735
Yeah. Who dies in The Apocalypse is very depending on who has a million or not

100
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:47,135
$1000000 that it wasn't really

101
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,927
Anything interesting it was kind of

102
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:49,951
Snooze

103
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:56,863
Answer for Wednesday

104
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,911
The 2003 episode

105
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:03,775
And then of course

106
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:10,175
6 weeks and I want to sit down

107
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:20,927
Overturning Roe v Wade

108
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,463
Some b*******

109
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:25,279
Listen its 2022 and I want

110
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:28,095
My legal opinions to ref

111
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,631
Prince people who burned witches

112
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:32,703
That's what I want I want to make sure that we keep

113
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,519
A continuity between the past and the present

114
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,055
U.s. verse

115
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:39,103
Goody Proctor

116
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:44,991
Goody Proctor was somebody Berkowitz.

117
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:47,039
Who's that who am I thinking of

118
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:50,879
Corey is a guy who got crushed

119
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:56,767
Ono anytime anyone

120
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:01,119
To it's bad times and you know

121
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,143
Obviously

122
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:06,495
I'm curious to see what Alex thinks about that and so Wednesday

123
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:09,823
What we're going to do for that was because the news broke Monday

124
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:13,151
Evening sure we were going to cover Tuesdays show

125
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:19,551
For Wednesday which we would have recorded on Tuesday immediately and it around instantaneously

126
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:25,951
Real hassle unfortunately Owen Shroyer was in studio

127
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:32,351
Did I got to say you know watching a little bit of that and see some of the responses

128
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:34,399
Is on social media and seeing some of the

129
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:39,007
Your video titles and posting on Infowars I would be lying if I said it didn't

130
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:41,311
So the trigger some of that stuff from

131
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:44,639
Alexa in whenever they were laughing and

132
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:50,271
Fixing the election night laughing at people who were worried about

133
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:54,367
Being in danger because of Rights being taken

134
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:58,719
Obviously it wasn't as

135
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:02,815
Impactful and severe is that shocked that evening prayer image

136
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:07,167
But they were over shades of it and

137
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,703
I mean it's tough

138
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:11,263
To exist in the space where you know that

139
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,823
Did somebody just handed down a desk

140
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:16,383
Shore and assert

141
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,687
Has if they pulled a f******

142
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:21,503
Gun

143
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,271
But

144
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:28,927
You know it's not going to happen right away so you don't know who it is and so you don't worry about it and then even on top of that you

145
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,975
You have the indominus

146
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:31,743
Portent

147
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:34,559
Of various other Supreme Court decision

148
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:37,375
That could be eroded very easily

149
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,399
Hands out

150
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:46,591
It's it's a bummer you think that's putting it lightly and I don't know if I have some of the

151
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,359
Correct words

152
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,127
Necessarily

153
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,663
Describe the role of the response

154
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,687
Bull blood

155
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:52,223
I don't know Jenna ciders

156
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:56,575
So Alex got back into Studio

157
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:59,903
Answer we're going to go over his response here

158
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:02,463
Some of it but I don't think you'll be able to predict

159
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:05,279
Yeah I would imagine that is

160
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:11,679
Is there

161
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,775
He's not really all that focused on Julio

162
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,079
The decision

163
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:24,479
Romanian right-wing talking point

164
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:28,063
The most popular thing we're ever going to do but look over here

165
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:39,327
You know I get I get what you're saying about you don't have to give it up for him and I agree

166
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,887
But it is surprising to me that he didn't

167
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:45,215
Jump on that totally to yell about that for awhile the same

168
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,751
Anthony of the court and all that nonsense

169
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:48,799
Oh my God

170
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,871
Factor into heavily but we'll see what does

171
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:52,895
In a moment but first

172
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:54,687
Hello doesn't do what

173
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:59,039
The first Spencer and Chris get on disc

174
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:03,903

Owen Shroyer broken lawyer thank you so much you are now policy

BP engine ET sitting in a tree k i s s i n g

178
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:31,551
I screwed up the rhyme structure

179
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:36,671
Thank you very much

180
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,719
Thank you very much

181
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:43,327
Next Tampa sounds a lot like

182
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:49,727
Play started listening while applying to Public Health

183
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,031

00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:57,407
Thank you very much

186
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:03,039
So we start off here at the beginning of Alex's show and here is what he is got

187
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,063
Going on

188
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:10,719
The right of a woman to kill her child is abortion

189
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:17,119
Quiet fart out loud could more people like Gloria Steinem of the Central Intelligence Agency

190
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:21,983
Abortion I'll do it again

191
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,055
Feel good

192
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:27,103
H Linda killed her child

193
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:31,967
This is not a minority of these leftist women this is the majority of them

194
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,319
I've been basically endowed with the satanic spirit

195
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:39,903
When they boarded her baby because they were lied to that it wasn't human

196
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:42,463
Instead of having the Holy Spirit softener hard

197
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,743
And repeat

198
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:46,047
Anymore

199
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:47,839
They said no

200
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:54,751
Peter Troost Rahway seitan

201
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:03,455
Yeah so refreshing to see the prize above a left-right paradigm man

202
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:06,527
Make sure everybody

203
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,295
Knew that he's

204
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:09,343
Is above the left-right paradigm

205
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,111
Say that s***

206
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:13,951
A little weird

207
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:19,583
There's something kind of simple about Alex's position that I can appreciate on one level

208
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:26,239
His opposition to reproductive Health Care is so clearly not based in rationality or a political position

209
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,287
Purely a product of religious zealot

210
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:35,199
There is no responsibility to argue with a position like the one he holds because there's literally nothing you can say that would dissuade him

211
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:38,271
I'm thinking that you're just Satan trying to seduce him away from Rachel

212
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:44,671
Business real world people get hurt

213
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:47,999
They pretend that they're driven by some kind of political beliefs

214
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:50,303
The game the appearance of respectability and

215
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,071
Make me laugh

216
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:54,655
Trick people into thinking that there's a point in arguing with them and with Alex

217
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:57,983
There is no point it's very clear it's just

218
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:04,639
I have wacky fundamentalist religious ideas about this and I will not be swayed Dan I mean it's

219
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,407
Almost like

220
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:06,687
And and

221
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:09,759
I'm going to follow this up and this is going to sound crazy to me

222
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:15,135
But in 2022 I think there are only bad faith conversations about abortion if they aren't

223
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:20,255
I'm using it to hurt women or I'm using it because I believe God makes me want to do that

224
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:24,095
There is no other conversation

225
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:24,863
Beasley

226
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:27,935
I don't really believe that this is entirely even honest

227
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:29,215
Cuz I don't believe Alex's

228
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:35,615
I don't think it's fully good-faith

229
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:36,383
But

230
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:39,455
Clearly an indication of a dead end

231
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:41,759
And so like you know there's no point

232
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:44,063
Who cares

233
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,087
I thought it important

234
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:47,135
Absolutely f*** you or a monster

235
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:51,487
So Alex discusses his experience with abortion

236
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:56,351
Listening to the show as much as we have Alex's name for at least 10

237
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,631
Maybe more

238
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:03,775
So here's what are you going to do this clearly so what he's going to do is he's going to wrestle with his

239
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:08,383
Current life now and if abortions were illegal whenever he wanted to get

240
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:12,479
So his life he would never have made it to the position that he's in if

241
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:15,551
Reproductive Health choices that we're capable

242
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:17,343
Of the women that he impregnated

243
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:19,903
Is read over and over again his life would be

244
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,183
Right now

245
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:23,231
Instead actually conversely what he

246
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:26,047
He tends to do I've heard this on a number of occasions

247
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:32,447
Because he was able to access these a reproductive health

248
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:38,847
Free of being able to romanticize the idea of what if these kids were alive Runaway

249
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:43,967
Right

250
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:47,807
He did get the benefit of these policies that he is so again

251
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:54,207
I think you might have actually argued me all the way to the side of being like if Alex had not been able to get abortion

252
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:57,023
We wouldn't have had Alex and we would have had another long mile truck

253
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,815
Well I think that

254
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:07,263
Doesn't justify anything know what that argument about how he got off

255
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,079
The the the abortion wagon let's say

256
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:12,895
I was touched by the Holy Spirit when I was about

257
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,015
Really I was upset

258
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:24,927
Said I'm not going to sit there and just show out three hundred bucks every time I get a check

259
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:28,255
Autonomous stuff

260
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:33,375
It's works

261
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,447
4 years old

262
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,215
Pointiest

263
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:38,239
Gross.

264
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,799
My dad's in front of me when I was about

265
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:45,151
$17 house and I needed money

266
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:48,479
Do you need do you need 300 bucks again

267
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,783
Let me guess you're killing my grandchildren

268
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,367
They said you need to stop

269
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,159
Real proud of you Dad

270
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:06,911
Shut that off my mind

271
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:12,543
What I done was wrong okay this is war

272
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:15,615
Can we not

273
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:17,919
Like this is the type of short

274
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:22,783
Clip that reveals all of the things that they assume are just acceptable like

275
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,319
We don't need to worry about things

276
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:28,927
Like my dad was like hey I need some money so my dad was going to

277
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:31,231
Give me money no point in time if you like

278
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:33,023
Well what if my dad didn't give me

279
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:35,583
Write what if he didn't have that money to give

280
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,119
And no point is that occurred

281
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:38,143
No no

282
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:40,191
Doesn't matter

283
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:42,751
I also

284
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:43,519
Just think of this

285
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:45,311
This belies like a really

286
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,591
Call me it's pretty f*****

287
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:47,615
The Dynamics

288
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:49,407
Series describing the heart

289
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,175
Heart just like

290
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:51,711
Yeah right

291
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:58,111
Clearly clearly have a lot more feelings about this that have nothing to do with the policy of reproductive Healthcare

292
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:00,159
That maybe you should unpack

293
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,439
In a therapeutic setting

294
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:04,511
Instead of drinking them away

295
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:08,607
Maybe the world would be a better place and you would stop seeing demons everywhere

296
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,143
If you took care of yourself

297
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:12,703
If you really engage with what

298
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:14,239
Just said as

299
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,519
I think this true

300
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:16,799
Man I don't want

301
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:22,687
Pull that thread there's some dark of course therapist to deal with

302
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:29,343
Unfortunately probably start talking about it, and we have to cover it

303
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,135
I told him about this if we all wait

304
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:35,999
2

305
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,023
I don't know

306
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:39,839
The Home Shopping Network shirt

307
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,375
So Alex

308
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:47,775
Clip of Biden but he mentioned where he said killing your baby is

309
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:52,127
Clip that's a surprise as if it is

310
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:55,199
Killing your yeah

311
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:02,111
Why'd you say the quiet part out loud at this is really hurting them bad

312
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,647
What he says

313
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,183
A shelf

314
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:11,839
Idea that we're going to make a judgment that is going to say that

315
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:18,239
No one can make the Judgment choose to abort a child

316
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:23,871
Decision by the Supreme Court I think those way overboard

317
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,967
What a hero

318
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:33,855
The decision to abort a child

319
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:36,415
Decisional board is actually murder

320
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,095
A child is the quote

321
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:51,007
Wow

322
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,823
Here's what's going on is that

323
00:18:54,079 --> 00:19:00,223
Issue that are refers to

324
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:00,991
Besides a child

325
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:08,415
The Killing no not misinterpret of this headline and he's over selling it

326
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:14,815
No it's it's at Biden called a fetus a child

327
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:15,839
This is how it go

328
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:17,631
Comes out

329
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:18,911
The quiet part loud heos

330
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:25,311
Alex has some shocking news to report

331
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,103
More than 10 states

332
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,895
California New York have laws

333
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:29,919
To kill babies

334
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,879
Bible healthy children

335
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:41,695
Abortions

336
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:46,559
Babies want to kill the old people

337
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:49,887
Does wide-ranging

338
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,167
What's covered

339
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,447
All of the p

340
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:53,471
Name those

341
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:55,007
10 + State yeah

342
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:57,055
Show me the Bells

343
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:59,871
Shut the fuk up

344
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,455
I would take

345
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:04,479
As much

346
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:05,503
Defense I believe

347
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:08,831
If someone whose political beliefs I agreed with

348
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:15,231
Spoke this Loosely features that matter

349
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:18,303
Theoretically right you never like oh okay

350
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,143
Abortion being legal is an overwhelmingly popular console

351
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,935
I'll tell you that because 6

352
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:27,007
Thousand states have signed it into a constitutional amendment

353
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:28,287
You know

354
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:30,591
Yeah it's it's a it's irresponsible

355
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:33,919
I'm presenting a fictional world for his audience to be very afraid

356
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:36,223
Now Alex make some

357
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:37,503
Some statements about the

358
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:38,271
The choice

359
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:40,575
Time to abort

360
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:41,343
Pregnancy

361
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:44,159
Nathan woman's own and he has no

362
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:46,463
What's between a person and God

363
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:47,999
I was not expecting

364
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,535
Letting God to be evolved

365
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:52,095
Between

366
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,119
God man

367
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:55,423
God in humans got in woman

368
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:57,471
And you know the woman

369
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:58,751
Wants to go to some

370
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:10,015
Federal system

371
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:16,416
Democrats

372
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:26,656
Your children to make a mask

373
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:27,424
Play Shots

374
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:29,216
Brainwash him in the Lacs

375
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:31,776
But I won't be happier healthy or

376
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,896
Seems to be suggesting that people like have destination

377
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,688
Abortions

378
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:39,456
Well I mean

379
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:41,504
It be okay so it'll out of state

380
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:43,552
In order to get

381
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:44,832
Married

382
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:46,624
Judge license

383
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,648
Put in Nevada

384
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:48,672
You can just

385
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:50,208
You know it's the same thing

386
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,256
I think that's a little bizarre

387
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:57,376
Decided by

388
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,144
That's not

389
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:05,056
If you believe that everything is between a person and God then he shouldn't give a single s*** what laws exist to protect access to

390
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:06,848
To reproductive care because guess what

391
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:13,248
It doesn't involve him at all it's between that person and God if you cannot give you free will

392
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,528
Involved

393
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:17,088
Right Alex believes that we all may be

394
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:18,368
He deserve to die in

395
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:22,208
Some kind of an extinction-level event because Society so evil and allows abortion

396
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:24,768
Just cut up a Zachary pretending to get some kind

397
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:25,792
Tolerant position

398
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:29,632
Packy cowardly and dishonest and I don't have time for it

399
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:34,752
Also that part at the end there should be a decent indication of what's the common where the rhetoric is going

400
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:38,336
This part about kids being happy and healthy and part of a nuclear family

401
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:39,616
Metric ring off

402
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:40,896
Loud alarm Bells

403
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:45,504
Slappy next goal is obviously going to be rolling by protections for the lgbtq

404
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,600
I knew be pretty naive to imagine that's where things are going to stop

405
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:56,000
Ultimately people in Alex's philosophical Community don't believe in the Civil Rights Act or the Voting Rights Act to literally

406
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:59,584
Did this is exactly what's going to happen

407
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:00,608
Lock

408
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:02,656
That we took for granted is on the table

409
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:04,448
In terms of being under threat

410
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,728
Yeah I'm coming

411
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:07,520
Oh my God who could have

412
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:08,288
Seen this coming

413
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:11,104
Yeah I mean it's

414
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:13,152
It's scary but now I don't

415
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:14,688
I don't want to I don't want to get

416
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:15,712
Into a place of

417
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:17,248
Catastrophizing

418
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,528
But

419
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:20,064
I think

420
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,344
B o b a

421
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:23,392
It's smart to not also take

422
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:24,928
For granted

423
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:28,768
Things are settled

424
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,632
To say this is the thing though it's like

425
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:35,424
It's going to get weird fast

426
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:37,216
And then it's going to get bad

427
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:40,544
I'm really not much anybody can do to stop it after

428
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:43,616
Fuels

429
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:44,384
It feels like it

430
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,152
It may

431
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:46,432
Yeah

432
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:47,968
Damn that I don't know

433
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:54,112
I mean it's just it's just so you know it's almost a f****** Indiana Jones Raiders of the Lost it's it's

434
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:56,928
Do you know that there's a giant f****** Stone Rollin

435
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:57,952
You got to run

436
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:58,976
That's it

437
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:01,792
Some news

438
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:06,400
Important

439
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,168
Genuine

440
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:11,008
MSNBC talkin head labels founding fathers

441
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:12,032
Racist

442
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:13,312
Misogynist

443
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:14,592
Jerk faces

444
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:16,896
Coming up next

445
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,992
Carlson Romano

446
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:25,088
Against Roe v Wade has been around

447
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:28,672
That's great that sucker reminded people of Biden

448
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:29,440
Past vote

449
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:35,840
New York Times reminded people of it in 2019 before he was elected but that's what you expect from the evil

450
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:37,888
Evil liberal mainstream media

451
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:44,800
If you want the nuanced explanation for this date that Biden comes from a Catholic background and his initial belief was that Rovers way

452
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:46,336
That decision was

453
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:47,616
The court going too far

454
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:51,456
Hey 1982 about 9 years into his time in Congress

455
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:54,784
Constitutional amendment was proposed to allow states to overturn the ruling

456
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:55,808
And buy it

457
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:57,344
Voted for it while it was in

458
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,112
Committee

459
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:04,256
He said at the time quote I'm probably a victim or a product however you want to phrase it of my background calling it quote

460
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:07,584
The single most difficult votive cast of the US Senate

461
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:09,120
Here's the thing though

462
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:11,168
To the full Senate

463
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:13,216
And it never came to a formal vote

464
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:13,984
Itself

465
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,800
The next gear and identical bill was proposed by devoted again

466
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:23,712
This isn't the gotcha that Alex and Tucker pretending it isn't the hot-and-cold history Biden has with abortion-rights is something

467
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:25,248
It's been widely discussed in

468
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:26,784
All sorts of outlets for

469
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:27,552
Quite a while

470
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,928
The only way this could seem like Tucker making a novel point is if you just have no familiarity with Biden

471
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:34,464
Accepted the cartoon character

472
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,024
Nvidia is presented him

473
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:37,792
Adidas

474
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:41,120
You're telling on yourself when you think that this is shocking

475
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:44,192
It is it is amazing to me that Tucker

476
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:51,104
It's like pulling that out like see whenever wherever literally all of us

477
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,688
Yeah that's why we f****** hated that guy in the first

478
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:55,712
F****** place

479
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:58,272
That's one of the reasons why there's some

480
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:02,624
Around him were some some reluctance

481
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,928
Yeah that's why it took a lot of

482
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:08,768
There's a Spider-Man on the loose

483
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:09,792
Which one

484
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:15,680
Miles Morales

485
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:22,080
That one's it he's great. Peter Porker it's not paid John Mulaney would have been a great spider pig

486
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:27,712
It's a guy who climbed the tower in San Francisco to protest

487
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:31,552
Wow, this week I'm back to

488
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:33,856

Free climbs second tallest California

490
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:37,696
California

491
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:38,976
California

492
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:41,024
Protest

00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:43,584
Scale the 60-plus story

Premium

495
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:53,312
Found something

496
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:55,360
You get arrested for

497
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:56,896
In San Francisco

498
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,832
Now

499
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:12,768
Story

500
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,328
Still

501
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:16,096
Psychotic

502
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:18,400
Don't worry he's going to rest it folks

503
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:20,192
Bring attention to saving the children

504
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:21,472
Wow Maps

505
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:23,264
Sure like that one's on Roc

506
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,800
3 episode

507
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:31,200
It shows that much Alex actually cares about that story remember that the woman is using to stoke racial hatred

508
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:31,968
Kate steinle

509
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:37,600
He doesn't remember because he doesn't give a s*** about her except as a prop that he can use to ferment white fear

510
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:40,928
Also short refresher in case you haven't heard those episodes from

511
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:41,696
Wayback

512
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:47,328
This is like 2015 I mean if she wasn't shot in the back because she was white

513
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:53,984
A man who happens to be an undocumented immigrant picked up something covered in a rag which turned out to be a gun unintentionally the gun discharged

514
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,800
And a bullet ricocheted and ended up hitting the

515
00:27:57,312 --> 00:28:03,456
It's a complete tragedy and my heart goes out to her only the racial element which doesn't exist

516
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:04,224
In reality

517
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:10,624
The guy who climb that Tower is named Mason to shop and he's building a little career for himself doing this Spider-Man

518
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,696
Your name is Mason Duchamp you're going to climb build

519
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:15,744
It's a risk

520
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:22,144
He was arrested last year for scaling a hotel in Vegas protesting covid restrictions

521
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,216
Misdemeanors for this. But I bet anything

522
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:26,240
Pepe's get dropped

523
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:28,032
Are minors

524
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:31,872
Like trespassing I mean he's just a dude who wants to climb shouldn't get attention

525
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:34,688
I don't even think he really gives a s*** about raising money

526
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:35,712
For these causes

527
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:40,576
Billion dollars by climbing this Tower

528
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:42,624
Pro-life causes

529
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,184
I mean let me put it this way all right

530
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:46,208
Ideologic

531
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:48,512
Play speaking I'm above the left-right paradigm

532
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:54,912
Ideologically speaking to put your palms forward in a way that to a building

533
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:59,008
Spider-Man outfits metaphor

534
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:02,336
I mean it listen if you're going to try and use

535
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:04,128
Carving a building in protest

536
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:05,152
There's a way to make money

537
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,688
Your Market.

538
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:07,456
To the right

539
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:10,016
Okay and you should probably get like

540
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:12,064
Sponsors to get on your back

541
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,088
No likey

542
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:14,368
Celebrity boxing

543
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,648
The left

544
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:16,672
Is going to be like

545
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:17,440
Get down

546
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:18,208
Get down from there

547
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:23,584
Stop it I don't think that's entirely true because people on the other side of the aisle do get arrested

548
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:25,376
I like

549
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:31,776
Patricia okumu who climbed the Statue of Liberty in protest a couple years back about to family separation

550
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:35,104
The right-wing media doesn't cover stories like that though except for like

551
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,640
Some sort of outrage

552
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:37,664
Immediately and then

553
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:42,272
Attention dies down I don't follow up and see the

554
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:43,808
They got arrested

555
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:46,112
It's Alex just doesn't know that that happened

556
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:47,392
He assumes that Liberals are

557
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:49,952
Just get away with everything

558
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:51,744
They didn't ask for Amelia

559
00:29:54,304 --> 00:30:00,448
That is a fair point

560
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,728
Alex is really dumb

561
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,008
And he's a huge race

562
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:04,544
So

563
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,312
We can just go to

564
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:07,360
Bank on those as being fairly can

565
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:08,384
Yes

566
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,456
Albedo Rizal so dumb and racist

567
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:13,760
So many people here up and well

568
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:14,784
He has some thought

569
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:16,064
About the midterms

570
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:18,368
Deee-lite

571
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:19,136
Bikes

572
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:21,696
The people that support

573
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:22,976
And the movement is

574
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,888
Populist elected all over the country

575
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:35,008
Because they know he's effective

576
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,288
The populist awaken

577
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:41,152
Clean sweep

578
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:43,200
Mary's in Ohio and Indiana

579
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:44,992
22

580
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,296
He's endorse

581
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:49,344
Post 1000 candidates at 2

582
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:52,160
1010

583
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:57,024
That sucks

584
00:30:57,536 --> 00:31:01,632
Alex is conveniently not mentioning about these 22 candidates the Trump endorse

585
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:04,704
21 their primaries is that only four of them

586
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,472
Incumbents

587
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:10,592
That makes a little bit of a difference in terms of having such a great batting average the incumbency bias

588
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:11,616
Is really high

589
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,456
Trump actually does though he does have a pretty good record with endorsement

590
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:18,016
But this hidden Dynamic does come up

591
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:18,784
Like this

592
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:19,808
Incumbency thing

593
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:24,672
Prince and supported 149 candidates in the 2020 house elections in

594
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:26,464
116 of them one

595
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:30,048
Of all of them but he got wrong only touring company

596
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:34,144
And his record was backing Challengers was less impressive than the overall numb

597
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,936
Rye Rye

598
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:38,496
If somebody was regularly picking the globe

599
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:40,800
You got your crush

600
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:45,664
The Globetrotters did occasionally lose

601
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,504
The generals have their nights

602
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,784
Okay thanks get hot

603
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:57,184
From 3 can you imagine being there the night they win

604
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,744
I now feel like they must have one

605
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,024
Irene

606
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:08,704
For Gabriel I kept in medieval times the wrong night accidentally took the other guy down and everybody just stop it was like

607
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:14,080
Bummer

608
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:18,688
Similarly though to this truck back 23 candidates for the Senate

609
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:20,736
2020 and 18 of them what

610
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:23,296
Only one of these people was running

611
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:25,856
Challenge against an incumbent Senator and

612
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:28,672
Every other challenge candidate the drunk back

613
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:30,976
He's not good at picking

614
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:32,768
Can people who are already in office

615
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:35,840
This is what I'm saying because the people who

616
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:37,376
6 who aren't already in office

617
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:40,704
Weirdos

618
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,032
Winning election think the only senator who wasn't in combat

619
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:46,848
He chose who won an 2020 was Tommy

620
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,920
Sure

621
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:51,456
Chirp

622
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:54,016
Hey it happens sometimes and if you

623
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:55,040
Coach

624
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:56,576
College football team

625
00:32:57,344 --> 00:33:00,160
And make sure that you get the most out of your child slave

626
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:02,464
Then you're gonna be in the government

627
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,232
Sooner or later

628
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:05,024
Fair enough

629
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,072
So Alex has some news

630
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:07,840
About

631
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:09,120
Austin Elementary

632
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:09,888
Preschools

633
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,936
This is shocking if true

634
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:13,216
And it's not true

635
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:16,800
That's shocking to hear him say that I guess

636
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:21,664
The LBGTQ p x y z

637
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:22,688
Elemento

638
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:24,992
Perfx UT

639
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:26,784
I mean

640
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:29,856
What about the lgbtq

641
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:31,904
AutoZone Austin

642
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,696
The middle schools and high schools elementary

643
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,536
Tell him you identify as LGBT. Here's a lollipop

644
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:40,864
When they do their recess time

645
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:44,704
And they're organized

646
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:52,640
Mud wrestling team for

647
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:54,944
For the oil wrestling

648
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,296
You're part of the wet t-shirt contest

649
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:02,624
And your training t-shirt contest

650
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:06,976
Lgbtq

651
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:09,280
Absolutely

652
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:12,864
Let's go confuse these kids are highly influenceable

653
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,656
With their Leaders with their teachers

654
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:18,496
Stinks

655
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:21,568
He's sounding a little confused

656
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:22,848
I like that

657
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:27,712
It started with like this was happening in high schools and it's a lollipop and extra recent

658
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:34,880
You know what they're doing in Middle School's do you know what they're doing a lollipop

659
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:36,928
Between geometry classes

660
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:37,696
What do we do

661
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:39,488
Yeah what is happened

662
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,280
I don't know I mean he's just making

663
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:44,864
You shut up in order to demonize people

664
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,400
Boots for the bigoted position

665
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:49,728
I'm just never we're just

666
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,288
As humans were never not going

667
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:54,080
Need to go through a f******

668
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:58,688
Satanic Panic or a Witch Hunt or something

669
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:05,088
Yeah we've had how many

670
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:08,672
Isabel and boring and then I'm going to have to look at people I know and be like

671
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:09,696
F******

672
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:11,488
Jacob Lawrence

673
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:15,584
It is it is a little sad yourself

674
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,352
If you fall for it

675
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:23,776
Well I mean I think someone like Alex would just make the argument that like I did never all for it I was right

676
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:27,360
Now that it's back you agree with me

677
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:28,896
So

678
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:30,432
I look this is

679
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:32,480
Get talking more about the school

680
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:34,528
Who's here this isn't

681
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:35,552
Never at The Big E

682
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:37,600
Big talking point I guess with all these

683
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:38,880
Right-wing decals

684
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:40,160
Jay-Z

685
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:41,952
Grooming

686
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:45,536
Another gloomy rhetoric and they learned a word and now there

687
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:46,304
They're obsessed

688
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:51,424
The entire credibly dangerous and they're putting

689
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,496
People in danger with this kind of rhetoric

690
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,032
Abhorrent

691
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,312
I hate them for it

692
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:58,592
We should

693
00:35:58,848 --> 00:35:59,360
Teach the right

694
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:00,640
Fewer words are more worth

695
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:01,408
Alex

696
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,944
Much like he is not saying

697
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:03,712
Delete

698
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:04,992
Is the important part about this

699
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:05,760
Supreme Court thing

700
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:08,576
Pray he's not jumping on the grooming bandwagon

701
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:12,160
Great although he has already in the past has been a big fan

702
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:15,488
And now he's just actually making it worse

703
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:18,304
4000 percent increase the last

704
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:20,864
Kids identifying as trans

705
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,424
But nobody is grooming children

706
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:27,776
Grooming and they're forcing them to Hell into it

707
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:30,848
This is a Colt of depopulation taking off

708
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:36,480
They all look like

709
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:38,272
Another soul

710
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:40,320
Black white what color they are

711
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:43,648
They all looks Jessie J

712
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,256
You are insane

713
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:50,304
Number of

714
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:54,400
The four thousand percent number that's daisja fast and hard press to back that up

715
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:55,168
Pasta

716
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:55,936
28

717
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:59,776
Story about the there's something in the UK and some vague surveys

718
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:04,896
There are increases to the population that identifies as trans as well as Gabe

719
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:07,200
Lesbian bisexual and non-binary

720
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:13,088
It's 4000% doesn't increase over some unspecified amount of time fine

721
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:14,368
Stipulate that for the sake of our

722
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:19,232
My issue really comes in when he says it has something to do with the schools or their influence

723
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:23,328
Because these self-identification Trends are being seen across most of the world

724
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:27,936
If I had something to do with our public education system you'd expect to see that

725
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:29,728
Phenomenon being more localized

726
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:33,056
No fairly all over the place so you think

727
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:35,360
Based on that you should maybe seek out another

728
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:36,384
Explanation for it

729
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,152
Maybe

730
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:40,992
Note suggests that a better explanation is that the number of actual lgbtq

731
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:41,760
Dq4

732
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:43,552
Hasn't really gone up all that much

733
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:48,672
But the general Vibe of most of the population has become accepted and other people can feel comfortable

734
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:49,696
Be open about them

735
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,024
That probably doesn't have full explanatory power but

736
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,584
It's way more likely in this b******* that Alex

737
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:57,632
Rolling around

738
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:58,912
Bunch of nonsense

739
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:02,752
Yeah you know I think what's fun about

740
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:04,544
The more

741
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,312
He talks

742
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:06,592
And the more of the world gets

743
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:07,872
The more I think

744
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:10,432
Think that his extreme characterizations of what

745
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:11,456
The left wants our

746
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:15,552
Are actually good ideas like maybe we should get rid of the idea of mother and father

747
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:16,320
There oh no

748
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:17,344
Children taught

749
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,368
As a group

750
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:24,512
Popipo no he's got you hot together by a Cooperative of people who all carry quilly about the

751
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:26,816
These children instead of say somebody being like

752
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:28,096
My kid is more important

753
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:29,888
So your transcript should die

754
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:34,240
Talk over millions of people so your child

755
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:36,800
Die alright Purple Penguin

756
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:38,336
Maybe Alex is right

757
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:43,968
I mean have we maybe what that's what we've been wrong about the whole time Alec

758
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:47,040
Has been right about telling us what we should be doing

759
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:48,064
To the right way

760
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:54,720
So his show is satire

761
00:38:54,976 --> 00:39:00,352
Thank you Alex now I am going to get rid of mother and father

762
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:02,400
Turbo penguin

763
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:03,168
So

764
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:05,728
This next clip I thought was pretty exciting

765
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:06,752
Because Alex

766
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:08,544
Hasn't read a story

767
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,568
You see the headline

768
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:11,104
Cold reading

769
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,152
He accidentally reports

770
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:13,920
But someone was

771
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:15,200
Beaten with tuna fish

772
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:22,368
Which I thought was really

773
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:25,440
Sweet

774
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,208
Purgatory

775
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:27,744
Torture taken hostage

776
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:31,072
With tuna fins

777
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:33,888
After leaving son without legs

778
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:37,984
Fellow inmates took him hostage and threatened to chop off his legs

779
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:39,520
Once they knew when he died

780
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:55,136
Alex love that Constitution man really her loves the Eighth Amendment cruel and unusual punishment

781
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:59,232
Oh yeah prison Justice which is in the Constitution

782
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:01,024
Really celebrated by our founding fathers

783
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:07,424
Why would you have prisons if you didn't want the prisoners to mete out their own form of

784
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,728
Right and it's

785
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:13,056
Clearly

786
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:19,712
It doesn't really matter because the story he's talking about is from the UK where Tony Smith was beaten in jail

787
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:20,992
They beat him with

788
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:25,088
Tuna cans 2210

789
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:27,392
1032 DeCamp

790
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:30,208
What's the situation where they were attacking him because

791
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:32,000
Yeah they knew he was there for betta

792
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:32,768
King's child

793
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,304
It also happened in 28

794
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:36,352
Also

795
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:37,888
Details here that Alex's mess

796
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:41,216
The first thing is that these two men that beat Smith didn't

797
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:42,752
Begin the attack because of his

798
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,312
They took him hostage in a Cell attempted

799
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,872
The force the jail to transfer them to another wing

800
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:49,664
They didn't want to be in this one cuz it was

801
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:54,528
Not good it was the type of place where you would take somebody hostage get out of it

802
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:02,464
Because of it right this was a prison beating of Opera

803
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:06,560
Not the jailhouse Justice Alex's fantasizing about it.

804
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:07,584
I mean birds

805
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:08,864
Stones again

806
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:11,168
Sure also it totally happen

807
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:14,240
4 years ago and for some reason Alex's reporting it is if it's

808
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:15,520
The current relevant story

809
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:19,616
In reality the only relevant news aspect of this is that there was a

810
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:21,408
Long delay in sentencing

811
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:23,712
The two men who beat Smith and that just happened recently

812
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:27,808
There's also led to a conversation about how Smith might be eligible for

813
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:28,576
For Government Camp

814
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:30,624
Sensation because the state has a duty

815
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:32,672
Protecting while he's in their custody

816
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:35,488
So this may end up costing UK taxpayers even more

817
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:36,768
That's

818
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,048
More reasonable

819
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:42,144
Yeah those justice system has a lot of Tangled threads

820
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:47,776
Important is that Alex loves this story because it makes them feel good to imagine violence being enacted on people he doesn't like

821
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:53,151
It's somewhat understandable to think of someone who abuses their child deserves whatever comes to them but it's

822
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:55,199
It strikes me as kind of sad when that's the beginning

823
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:56,991
And ending of Alakazam Alice

824
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:59,295
Really shallow and it's just

825
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:00,319
Kind of built out of

826
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:01,343
Anger feelings

827
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:02,111
Good to him

828
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:03,647
Yeah you know is every

829
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:05,695
Is a certain and I'm going to throw this out there

830
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:07,743
Like if you want to build a society

831
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:10,047
Especially one that funk

832
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:12,095
Maybe you don't put p

833
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:12,863
People who

834
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:16,703
First and initial reaction is the only one they care about

835
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:18,495
And then forget about it later on

836
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:19,519
So like

837
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:20,287
Like for instance

838
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:25,663
It's like if you're building a society or like maybe we should protect people even if we incarcerate them

839
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:30,527
One day we will be incarcerated justice system isn't perfect

840
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:35,391
Innocent in their letter

841
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:38,207
Perhaps any one of us could have this happen to us

842
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:40,767
Instead of being like that guy back

843
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:42,815
Maybe that's not going to work

844
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:43,839
Not but the long-term

845
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:47,679
That's the Constitutional Infowars way of dealing with it

846
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:49,215
Salix

847
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:50,239
Do you got a milli

848
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:51,263
Bitcoin

849
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:57,663
The same guy

850
00:42:57,919 --> 00:43:02,783
It'll be millions of anything I've ever received

851
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:04,831
Feel the need to talk about this but also

852
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:08,415
After pretty bad before I forget

853
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:11,487
Clusters of something

854
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:14,303
Corporate media spends this all day

855
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:18,399
We were given a 1 million dollar

856
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:19,167
Roughly

857
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:20,703
Donation we can go

858
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:23,775
Donation

859
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:25,311

860
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:26,591

Sixty-five 70%

862

In the black

863
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:38,879
Explaining for treading water

864
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:45,791
Secret was evil

865
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,607
They're the ones that are saying

866
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:03,199
Is mental illness

867
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:08,063
A woman

868
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:09,343
AAA

869
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:16,511
You seem a little defensive about the chameleon

870
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:23,167
I'm starting to think that maybe he's a little bit like I might not have dessert

871
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:29,567
I might not have wanted people to know about that cuz it's sketchy

872
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:30,335
My final

873
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:32,383
I mean certainly

874
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:38,783
Because some issues when you present yourself as like I rely on

875
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:39,551
Donation

876
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:43,391
Same time disillusion anything if you have like

877
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:45,439
Someone is running for office in

878
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:46,975
Seems like I only take small donation

879
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:48,255

What am I buying your

I think he actually does wrestle with that a little bit on this episode YouTube I s***

You're selling out of all the giant inventory we have a teacher at some of the years

897
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:49,695
Basically this show is like now settled in I mean

898
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:52,255
God knows that by next week

899
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:53,791
Or tomorrow he might

900
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:55,839
Be completely freaking out again

901
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:56,607
But like

902
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:58,399
It feels more normal

903
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:02,239
Then it has a week and a half or so

904
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:04,543
If I had to guess the reason for that

905
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:05,311
It's because what

906
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:06,335
He needed

907
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:09,151
Was money to buy stuff to sell to hazard

908
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:13,247
And a million dollars to pay off the kitchen

909
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:15,295
Get away with

910
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:18,879
Kicking down the road that was something he had to pee right away

911
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:21,951
I think that he's got that

912
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:24,255
And he was able to pull this.

913
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:25,023
With a bankruptcy

914
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:28,351
Need to postpone the trial. So now he's on borrowed time again

915
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:29,887
A not that like

916
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:32,447
Immediacy of the court case

917
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:33,983
That's going to

918
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:39,103
Be a real problem for him somewhere down the line

919
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:39,871
He's like

920
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:44,223
Wiggled his way out and he's got a little bit of breathing room again

921
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:47,551
I think you think that's the kind of feeling that I have

922
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:48,575
From this

923
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:50,111
Disgusting

924
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:51,903
I'm starting to really think that if

925
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:53,183
You've got a lot of money you can

926
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:55,743
Can really screw with the American justice system

927
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:57,279
I'm

928
00:46:57,535 --> 00:47:00,863
Listen I'm going to go all the way and say that this goes from the top

929
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:03,935
It certainly doesn't come the other way

930
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:06,495
You know there's not a whole lot of people who are like you know just

931
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:10,591
Everyday workers out there like I'm a judge

932
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:11,359
Furious

933
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:16,479
Well your workaday person you know out there

934
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:18,271
Could get away with more

935
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:21,343
Bandit I mean put it on the ballot

936
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:26,207
I am going to buy some brainforce otherwise this rich person will have to face

937
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:26,975
Consequence

938
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:29,023
Sapulpa

939
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:30,303
Has come out

940
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:31,583
That Pope

941
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:32,607
He's probably against

942
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:33,375
The war

943
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:35,423
Which is unusual for Pope

944
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:36,191
He is

945
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:38,495
Confused

946
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:41,567
Just about a headline that he read

947
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:42,335
Why is the Pope

948
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:49,503
Francis says NATO may have provoked Russia invasion of Ukraine

949
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:50,527
Hopes to meet

950
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:51,551
Putin in Moscow

951
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:55,903
Blame the weapons

952
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:56,671
Washers

953
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:59,999
And says that they are the ones that stand together endangering the world

954
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:05,887
Cuz almost everything

955
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:15,615
Yeah he was a reward

956
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:18,431
Well I reckon

957
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:23,295
Carrabba's

958
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:30,975
And I

959
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:34,047
Wanted to be a good strong Christian Institution

960
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:35,327
But

961
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:38,911
Under this Pope it has been the opposite of that hasn't that's debatable

962
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:40,703
Out of the Catholics were up in arms about it

963
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:42,495
What is this

964
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:46,079
Francis

965
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:49,151
Russian invasion of Ukraine

966
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:51,455
Extra meat Putin in Moscow

967
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:57,343
Largest Italian daily newspapers

968
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:03,999
To meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in the near future

969
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:06,559
I asked cardinal

970
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:07,839
Corona

971
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:14,751
That I was willing to go to Moscow

972
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:20,639
Are still insisting even if

973
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:23,199
Tablets meet what time

974
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:26,015
Kansas fatality not be stopped

975
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:30,111
25 years ago we experienced the same thing in Wanda

976
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:32,927
Blame

977
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:37,023
And the fact that NATO overthrew

978
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:38,047
Government

979
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:41,631
And you know the rest

980
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:42,911
Story

981
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:51,103
This is a fascinating example of

982
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:53,151
Common feature on Alex's show

983
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:56,479
He takes a story that has a kernel of Truth and then he just makes stuff

984
00:49:57,503 --> 00:50:01,855
In this case it is true that the pope gave an interview where you suggested that it was possible that

985
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:05,695
Quote NATO barking Skateland

986
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:06,463
Ukraine

987
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:07,487
Also save quote

988
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:10,047
I have no way of telling whether his rage has been

989
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:13,631
Provokes but I suspect it was may be facilitated by the West

990
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:14,399
Attitude

991
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:15,679
Isn't interest

992
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:18,239
Bank statement but it's also a far cry from what Alec

993
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:19,007
What is reporting

994
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:23,615
Hope also said quote the ukrainians can't be blamed for having fought back

995
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:24,895
In the dawn boss which

996
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:26,687
Which implies they were fighting back

997
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:27,455
I got something

998
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:29,759
He also said quote now the Russians

999
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:33,599
Take a note just add-on boss region but Crimea Odessa and the ports

1000
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:35,135
On the Black Sea everything

1001
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:38,975
I have a bad feeling about it all all admit I'm very pessimistic

1002
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:41,791
However it's our duty to do all we can to stop the war

1003
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:44,351
In terms of blaming weapons manufacturer

1004
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:46,911
The Russian

1005
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:50,495
Just found out the tanks are useless and they might be developing new weapon

1006
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:53,055
Wars are fought for this reason to

1007
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:53,823
Detest your arson

1008
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:57,663
This is what happened to the Spanish Civil War before the second World War

1009
00:50:58,175 --> 00:51:00,479
The production and the sale of armaments is disgrace

1010
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:02,783
But you are bold enough to stand up against it

1011
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:06,367
It's fair to say that the arms sales or something the pope opposes

1012
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:08,671
Recognizes is apart of all wars

1013
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:10,207
But Alex is really over selling

1014
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:10,975
Disposition

1015
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:11,743
To be like

1016
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:13,023
This is all about weapons

1017
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:14,559
I mean date

1018
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:16,095
It is so much like

1019
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:16,863
What in

1020
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:18,143
God's name do you think so

1021
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:19,423
Hope is going

1022
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:20,703
Sing about a war

1023
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:22,495
Not good morning God

1024
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:23,519
Kids named what

1025
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:24,543
Who is like

1026
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:25,311
Hey man

1027
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:26,847
I got to be honest

1028
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:29,407
I think slaughtering millions of people is gray

1029
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:31,711
Break with tradition

1030
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:35,551
This was pretty good this is a good one

1031
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:39,391
That's a good one

1032
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:41,951
Since the 1500s have we seen a war

1033
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:43,999
This good this is a joke

1034
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:46,559
All that other stuff that Alex is Angus just making

1035
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:47,327
Stuff up

1036
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:49,631
He just wants the pope statement to sound more like

1037
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:51,167
Validates his own Merit

1038
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:57,311
Alex is doing this because he knows most of his audience only need superficial validation to feel like Alex

1039
00:51:57,567 --> 00:51:58,335
Has been proven right about

1040
00:51:59,103 --> 00:52:05,247
Spriggs a Google Pope and NATO and see headlines like quote Pope Francis blames nato in the Wall Street

1041
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:08,575
Is right about all the other stuff he said

1042
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:10,623
It's a tricky can pull because

1043
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:13,951
You know he's just riffing headlines and he's trained as audio

1044
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:16,767
Just to do the same and pretend there's some sort of a death do it

1045
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:17,791
That's all he's doing

1046
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:19,327
If anything Alex

1047
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:22,399
Ever says ever means anything then the pope cannot

1048
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:23,423
Possibly be making

1049
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:24,703
King estate Metallica's pretend

1050
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:25,471
He is

1051
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:26,495
Believe you

1052
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:27,263
The globalist

1053
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:32,639
It's not a big deal that you'll be saying these things it would be a repudiation of Alex's entire world

1054
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:36,223
The pope isn't someone who changes their mind because it got hot

1055
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:40,831
He's supposed to be an emissary of the devil who's weirdly obsessed with breaking up American militia

1056
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:42,879
The literals

1057
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:44,415
Photo guys

1058
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:47,231
Oh no we've got to change our behind and let's

1059
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:50,815
Let's rip but it it's not like the pope is in League with the literal

1060
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:54,143
Christian devil if the literal Christian devil is real

1061
00:52:54,399 --> 00:52:55,423
Then so is the Pope

1062
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:57,983
Do you know what I mean

1063
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:02,335
Have a great Point using fallible

1064
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:06,175
I forgot about that

1065
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:08,735
Magic powers Eve never would have been able to arrest

1066
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:13,855
If your if your religion is real than the pope gets

1067
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:20,255
Magic I don't understand how that's not that's not a regular conversation I forgot about that

1068
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:25,631
2Pac magic not just the pope to like a lot of people

1069
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:28,447
Can perform Miracles your transubstantiation is

1070
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:35,871
Absolutely

1071
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:39,967
Magic is

1072
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:40,735
Avail

1073
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:42,015
2

1074
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:43,039
People who believe in

1075
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:44,319
Bulshit

1076
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:46,367
So Alex is a map

1077
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:47,647
Of NATO

1078
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:49,951
And he really wish this one

1079
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:51,487
And here's the map

1080
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:54,815
Really really matters right here

1081
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:57,631
Not an inch of NATO's

1082
00:53:58,911 --> 00:53:59,935
Military jurisdiction

1083
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:01,983
Spread

1084
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:03,519
Random of

1085
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:12,223
February 9th 1990

1086
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:13,503
And then

1087
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:16,063
George Herbert Walker Bush confirm that in speeches

1088
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:17,343
And it policies

1089
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:19,647
But now what have they done

1090
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:25,535
1990 here's the map of

1091
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:26,815
In red

1092
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:31,679
Places

1093
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:35,007
Turkey and Spain and France and Sweden

1094
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:39,103
But now it's expanded into more than a dozen

1095
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:39,871
Other

1096
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:41,407
Countries

1097
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:45,247
Alex is lying about the agreement between Baker and garbage jobs

1098
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:48,831
Easter

1099
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:52,671
President became entirely irrelevant as Germany reunified

1100
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:54,719
Also Sweden isn't part of NATO

1101
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:58,559
Looking at this map doesn't know where Sweden is

1102
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:00,351
He thinks Norway

1103
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:04,191
This week in Finland are going to be Jordan 80 Alpha quick

1104
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:05,983
Actually something that I think

1105
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:09,567
Is revealing of how little Alex knows exactly current modern

1106
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:11,103
Right

1107
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:12,895
Think it's a big deal.

1108
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:16,223
Sweden is not part of NATO because of the conversations that they're having a

1109
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:18,271
Prompted by Russia's aggression

1110
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:19,295
Ukraine

1111
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:23,391
Gerardo Handel on any of this

1112
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:24,671
The cause of all of this

1113
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:28,767
Why exactly are people are non-nato countries react

1114
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:29,791
Things to this going like

1115
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:33,375
We got to get an 800 otherwise we're going to get invaded

1116
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:34,143
Yeah it

1117
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:37,727
It seems it seems strange there's little moments like that that like

1118
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:43,103
It seems like a fuk up or like a mistake revealing of an underlying ignorance

1119
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:47,711
Caring to learn anymore

1120
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:48,735
Headlines

1121
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:51,807
If you learn something then you might have to change your

1122
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:59,231
And if that weren't a true statement that was rejected by so many people it would be very funny

1123
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:01,279
Prosthetic

1124
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:03,583
Is directly on that here in a little bit love it

1125
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:05,887
But first Alex has to narrate a meme

1126
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:08,191
Really informative memes

1127
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:11,775
Catch my drift

1128
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:13,823
Figures

1129
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:16,895
I'm simulcasting radio phones

1130
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:19,967
Allied 123456 stick figures

1131
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:26,111
Yummy fruit one of them Falls over and dies

1132
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:29,695
Correlation does not equal

1133
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:30,719
Causation

1134
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:32,511
And they all died

1135
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:34,815
And that's what we're witnessing

1136
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:36,095
With the vaccines

1137
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:37,631
That's um

1138
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:38,911
Still

1139
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:40,447
Having proven causation

1140
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:41,983
You know what to do

1141
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:48,127
One thing all six of them could have been poisoned earlier right

1142
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:49,663
One thing about

1143
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:50,687
A Battleground

1144
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:53,247
Being the removal in murder of other

1145
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:54,271
People and their right

1146
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:55,807
Is that

1147
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:57,855
The news doesn't really hit it

1148
00:56:58,111 --> 00:56:59,903
It's hard so you can just narrate memes

1149
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:01,439
Do you know no big deal

1150
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:08,095
I'm going to narrate memes when you get a couple million dollars coming in no one else to die anymore

1151
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:13,215
First of all there's one decision that is like

1152
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:13,983
To get this

1153
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:16,799
People need it

1154
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:18,847
He bastard talk through it

1155
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:20,383
Explain to me

1156
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:24,991
I meant third thing can't explain that he's explaining to me because he's on the radio

1157
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:26,015
Yeah

1158
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:26,783
Futon

1159
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:27,551
That's how you get

1160
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:28,319
Amine

1161
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:29,599
Yeah

1162
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:32,159
I can't I mean

1163
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:33,951
It's like it's like

1164
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:35,743
The board

1165
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:38,815
The version of theater

1166
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:40,351
Is fine cuz that's a dark

1167
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:42,911
Sure it's like if that was really bad

1168
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:46,239
You're taking something that's a different form of medium

1169
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:47,263
Running it in the

1170
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:49,055
Previous generations medium

1171
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:49,823
You know like

1172
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:51,871
What is reporting something visually

1173
00:57:52,127 --> 00:57:53,151
Audio media

1174
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:54,943
But he's doing it so poorly

1175
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:56,223
It's bad

1176
00:57:56,479 --> 00:57:58,271
Radio Improv

1177
00:57:58,527 --> 00:57:59,039
All psychic

1178
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:00,831
That they have to Bendix

1179
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:02,623
Explain the sight gag

1180
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:09,023
In The Improv scene yeah yeah funny how you kicked your leg out above over your head in that moment

1181
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:12,607
Where it was funny to do that the thing that makes the thing

1182
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:14,911
In any way useful

1183
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:15,679
And you remove it

1184
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:17,727
Diamond remove another layer of that

1185
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:19,007
What a dork

1186
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:20,287
So are we get

1187
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:22,335
Back to

1188
00:58:22,591 --> 00:58:24,639
We actually just get to Alex taken

1189
00:58:25,663 --> 00:58:27,199
Call from a farmer

1190
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:30,527
Alex wants to

1191
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:33,343
Things are bad things going to be bad

1192
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:39,231
I don't want to make this about the Ukraine situation and fertilizer

1193
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:41,279
Bushes in that direction

1194
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:42,303
And then

1195
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:44,095
The farmer is like

1196
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:45,119
There's something

1197
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:48,959
You're saying

1198
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:50,495
People not planning

1199
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:52,031
Because I don't have fertilizer

1200
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:55,103
Well not planting in all

1201
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:55,871
Also

1202
00:58:56,127 --> 00:58:57,151
The fact that the

1203
00:58:57,663 --> 00:58:59,455
We had the torrential rains we got

1204
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:00,991
Half of our annual rain

1205
00:59:02,015 --> 00:59:02,527
Within a week

1206
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:03,551
. of time

1207
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:04,831
And

1208
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:07,391
We just ain't going to get out in the field or already

1209
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:09,695
Two weeks behind the 8-ball already

1210
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:12,255
That's going to be another two weeks

1211
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:14,047
Before people can even get in the field

1212
00:59:14,303 --> 00:59:14,815
Plant

1213
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:16,351
Are corn and soybeans

1214
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:22,239
Unbelievable sir God bless you

1215
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:29,407
Young people on average play radio

1216
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:30,175
Ammoland

1217
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:31,711
WhatsApp

1218
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:38,367
That's your point.

1219
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:40,927
The most common sense

1220
00:59:41,439 --> 00:59:43,231
Ninety-plus percent

1221
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:45,023
How should the

1222
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:47,071
Name one of them it's the Bill of Rights

1223
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:53,471
Because I watched so much of Alex's show I know that they don't do studies he's talking about a Mark Dice Man on this

1224
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:54,239
Street B

1225
00:59:54,495 --> 00:59:55,519
That's not a study

1226
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:58,847
Drunk people out of Boardwalk

1227
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:02,175
Editing app to make people look stupid

1228
01:00:02,431 --> 01:00:02,943
Stupid

1229
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:07,551
Yeah it what happened there that pause and the reason that Alex goes off in

1230
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:09,855
Completely different direction is good with that guy's describing

1231
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:16,255
Climate like last year in the years before here's the thing that's regular

1232
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:17,791
And now the climate is

1233
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:22,143
Torrential rains that are really actually

1234
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:23,935
Even if we had fertilizer

1235
01:00:24,191 --> 01:00:26,495
These are out of seasonal rains

1236
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:29,311
Yeah you expect rains to not do this

1237
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:30,847
It's different

1238
01:00:31,103 --> 01:00:35,455
Got to ramble about a Mark Dice video they were pretending as a study

1239
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:38,271
You imagine if 90%

1240
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:39,807
Good name an amendment

1241
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:42,111
Throw me throw me out to like

1242
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:43,135
A f******

1243
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:47,743
God damn Wolf Blitzer been like they've done studies and while we're going to go see these in

1244
01:00:47,999 --> 01:00:49,023
Go to a jaywalking

1245
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:51,839
20 years ago.

1246
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:55,935
I mean that's the level of content that you get here

1247
01:00:56,703 --> 01:00:57,215
Tip of the spear

1248
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:01,823
Got to get on it

1249
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:04,639
So we get to talking about the

1250
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:05,663
Pliers

1251
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:06,687
The food plant

1252
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:10,015
Got to watch out for a little bit on a recent episode

1253
01:01:10,527 --> 01:01:13,343
I'll bet that caller wants to say hey man

1254
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:14,111
This is big

1255
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:14,879
Big deal

1256
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:16,671
This is a big deal

1257
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:19,231
Bring up one thing and I'll let you run with

1258
01:01:22,047 --> 01:01:22,815
About this a little bit

1259
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:23,839
But no one is

1260
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:25,375
On.

1261
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:28,191
From the food industrial food

1262
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:31,007
Unbelievable

1263
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:39,967
Wellshire

1264
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:44,831
More plants are burned down each day

1265
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:50,207
Manawa statistics has been looked into my statistician

1266
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:51,999
Which team won

1267
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:54,815
Thousands of people 11 name

1268
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:56,095
Anyway

1269
01:01:58,911 --> 01:01:59,423
Make up a name

1270
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:02,751
It's crazy

1271
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:07,615
Thousands of times the normal amount so like

1272
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:10,687
If the normal was one there's been a thousand

1273
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:16,575
Ridiculous completely making up everything he said there

1274
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:19,391
I somewhat suspect that he'd even forgotten that this was

1275
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:22,719
Was a conspiracy supposed to be worried

1276
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:23,999
Scout yeah

1277
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:28,607
To fact-check reached out to the National Fire Protection Association to get some insight

1278
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:34,495
Since the recent social media posts and Tucker Carl Carlson segments about this

1279
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:38,847
The NFPA gets their data from the national fire incident reporting C

1280
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:43,455
System and I want you to guess how many manufacturing and processing plant fires

1281
01:02:43,711 --> 01:02:44,735
There are in an average

1282
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:47,807
112

1283
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:54,207
5308 strictly agricultural play

1284
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:54,975
Plant sure

1285
01:02:55,487 --> 01:02:58,559
Between January and April 2022 there were

1286
01:02:58,815 --> 01:03:00,351
20 fires reported at us

1287
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:06,751
Food processing facilities which if everything is actually in the normal to low side of where they would be in a normal

1288
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:09,823
That sounds like a good week

1289
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:18,783
Peaks at certain times

1290
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:19,551
It seems like this

1291
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:21,599
Everything I can tell this very much

1292
01:03:21,855 --> 01:03:23,135
Normal or low right

1293
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:26,975
Susan McKelvey a spokesperson for the NFPA summed it up I think

1294
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:27,743
Pretty well

1295
01:03:27,999 --> 01:03:34,143
The recent inquiries around these fires appears to be a case of people suddenly paying attention to them and being surprised about

1296
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:35,423
How awesome they do occur

1297
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:39,775
But NFPA does not see anything out of the ordinary in these numbers

1298
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:45,919
I would expect that we're more the case for all of like the huge or systemic problems that we face

1299
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:48,223
That people are just you just believe

1300
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:49,503
Blissfully Auto

1301
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:51,295
Oh there's no public transport

1302
01:03:51,807 --> 01:03:52,319
What

1303
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:54,367
Serious problem now

1304
01:03:54,879 --> 01:03:55,391
Yeah

1305
01:03:55,647 --> 01:03:58,975
People like Alex and Tucker didn't know that these certifiers were so,

1306
01:03:59,231 --> 01:04:02,815
So when they saw Tom memes about this fire that fire things must be

1307
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:04,863
So much more than a normal year

1308
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:06,143
It looks fun for them

1309
01:04:06,655 --> 01:04:09,215
It's exciting to think there's some Grand nefarious plot

1310
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:09,983
But you're covering

1311
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:11,263
Saving the food supply

1312
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:12,287
That excite

1313
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:17,407
Bixby audience and releases as fun endorphins you get when your role playing Prophet Detective

1314
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:18,431
Plus

1315
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:19,455
The alternative

1316
01:04:19,711 --> 01:04:20,223
Sucks

1317
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:22,527
If you look into this and you realize that it's

1318
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:26,623
Totally normal that there be this many fires at Food facilities what can

1319
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:27,391
Can you do

1320
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:31,231
You don't get to accuse vague groups of enemies of planning to kill you

1321
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:32,511
You just kind of two

1322
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:37,887
You either shrug and say that's just how things are or you can be a total dork and advocate for

1323
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:42,495
Stronger fire safety regulations at these facilities

1324
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:46,591
It's not exciting to an audience that doesn't give you the Russia pretending

1325
01:04:47,103 --> 01:04:51,455
What kind of bowl truth-teller large systemic problem is going to take

1326
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:52,991
Years to face

1327
01:04:54,527 --> 01:04:56,575
Concerted effort in the front of

1328
01:04:56,831 --> 01:04:58,623
Actually make

1329
01:04:58,879 --> 01:05:01,183
Progress we have to focus

1330
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:04,767
And nobody can get mad about things along the way we just have to

1331
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:09,119
To do it bad it's a disaster it's so Alex

1332
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:15,519
He makes up s*** about statisticians and probabilities because he wants to give the appearance of having looked into stuff

1333
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:16,799
But he doesn't want after

1334
01:05:17,055 --> 01:05:20,383
Reach that unsatisfying conclusion he would reach if he actually did it

1335
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:26,783
Top statisticians from Statin use prestigious

1336
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:28,575
Top status

1337
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:29,599
Rights

1338
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:31,903
I can't

1339
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:34,207
Prestigious

1340
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:35,999
It is it is so weird

1341
01:05:36,255 --> 01:05:42,399
I mean I didn't know I'd be able to get something from their b******* and have them

1342
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:45,215
Sensationalize it and then I've learned more about it I'm like

1343
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:49,567
How if I let this go on for so long but probably because I'm reading about cop

1344
01:05:49,823 --> 01:05:51,615
Cops being great or whatever it is that do says

1345
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:58,271
Fair enough if you think about the number of facilities there actually are in the United States

1346
01:05:58,527 --> 01:06:00,319
5300 is it

1347
01:06:00,575 --> 01:06:01,343
That like

1348
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:07,743
High of a percentage of them. They're all burning down all the way

1349
01:06:07,999 --> 01:06:11,839
They got this amount of structural damage

1350
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:16,959
I think it is a little bit shocking

1351
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:17,727
It just to like

1352
01:06:17,983 --> 01:06:19,775
See numbers and we like right now

1353
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:21,567
That's not a that's not something

1354
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:24,895
Touches my life all that often

1355
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:27,967
And I allowed it to continue

1356
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:29,247
It's something that

1357
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:31,039
B alternative

1358
01:06:31,551 --> 01:06:33,087
To having that response

1359
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:33,855
Is

1360
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:36,415
Ship it'll freak people out

1361
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:37,695
And it's a beaut

1362
01:06:39,231 --> 01:06:41,023
You can't just have this problem be like okay

1363
01:06:42,047 --> 01:06:44,863
I don't care let's listen let's get above a left-right paradigm

1364
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:46,655
That's too many fires

1365
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:47,423
How about that

1366
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:49,471
How about we can agree that shirt men

1367
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:51,007
I don't know what the correct

1368
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:56,383
Ramona fires reason I push back a little bit a little

1369
01:06:56,639 --> 01:07:02,783
Because I am not 100% sure why all these fires are happening cuz I don't know what Rey

1370
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:06,367
Regulations could help

1371
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:07,135
Maybe

1372
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:09,695
Agreed maybe there isn't a better way

1373
01:07:09,951 --> 01:07:16,095
Creep I don't know. That's why I see this is elect right man I don't even know what's going on I'm just looking at the number

1374
01:07:16,351 --> 01:07:18,911
Tires and I'm saying let's make that number

1375
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:22,495
Lower sure this is why we've got the National Fire Protection

1376
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:27,871
Association thinking about these things right

1377
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:29,919
Chirp

1378
01:07:30,431 --> 01:07:31,455
This guy's not happy with him

1379
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:32,479
Because

1380
01:07:33,503 --> 01:07:36,319
He thinks that Alex is holding onto Trump

1381
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:37,855
Oh yeah

1382
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:38,623
Get rid of them

1383
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:39,903
Think you're given Trump app

1384
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:40,927
Right now

1385
01:07:41,439 --> 01:07:42,207
And I think

1386
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:45,023
You're still holding on to the idea

1387
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:46,559
Is organic

1388
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:48,863
And that Trump is real and I think that

1389
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:50,655
System would never allow that

1390
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:53,215
Because the system would never jeopardize

1391
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:54,751
Steak

1392
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:55,775
The control the power

1393
01:07:56,031 --> 01:07:57,567
They would never let someone organic

1394
01:07:58,591 --> 01:07:59,359
Jeopardize that

1395
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:02,175
And you keep holding on to this idea that they are

1396
01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:04,991
You keep saying this thing that Obama is running things

1397
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:06,271
Obama

1398
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:07,551
Again

1399
01:08:07,807 --> 01:08:09,855
There never just be one guy running things

1400
01:08:10,623 --> 01:08:11,135
Far worse

1401
01:08:11,903 --> 01:08:13,439
Bend Obama is running

1402
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:16,511
And I get what you're saying there but you're still

1403
01:08:17,023 --> 01:08:19,583
Directing people into the left-right paradigm

1404
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:20,863
And you're still giving this

1405
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:21,887
System

1406
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:22,911
When it doesn't have one

1407
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:25,983
And another thing

1408
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:39,295
Populist movement

1409
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:44,159
Bolsonaro

1410
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:52,607
This caller is saying

1411
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:56,703
I was just interested in Trump because of some movement the coalesced around him

1412
01:08:56,959 --> 01:08:57,471
How to

1413
01:08:57,727 --> 01:08:59,519
Crying on air about how he was willing to

1414
01:08:59,775 --> 01:09:05,919
Die for Trump he's our god king appointed by God for this moment to provide us with an a

1415
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:13,343
Yeah he can get the f*** out of here with these attempts to rewrite his past a little less embarrassing now

1416
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:16,415
Come on

1417
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:19,231
Invented shoes

1418
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:21,023
I did know that I gave you

1419
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:24,351
Is pretty great excessively over the details

1420
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:28,191
I think it makes sense of Alex thinks that he made that up

1421
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:34,591
Understands the concept he thinks that being above the left-right Paradigm just means beating

1422
01:09:40,735 --> 01:09:41,503
Even if you think that Trump is

1423
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:43,039
Alex.

1424
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:45,087
It recognizes some people are

1425
01:09:45,855 --> 01:09:46,367
Like Alex

1426
01:09:46,879 --> 01:09:49,439
But I'm explaining that the Trump movement

1427
01:09:50,207 --> 01:09:53,023
Galvanizing force is really scared the New World Order

1428
01:09:59,423 --> 01:09:59,935
Organic

1429
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:01,215
The people are organic

1430
01:10:01,471 --> 01:10:03,263
I know I'm real I know I'm not getting any

1431
01:10:03,519 --> 01:10:05,055
Secret help from the New World Order

1432
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:08,383
I'm getting a million-dollar

1433
01:10:14,527 --> 01:10:15,551
Brother

1434
01:10:15,807 --> 01:10:18,879
That your response is entirely right like if Alex wants to keep up this

1435
01:10:19,135 --> 01:10:23,743
Appearance then he's going to need to publicly reveal who the person was who gave him $2000000 or crypt

1436
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:26,815
His whole thing is as all these like

1437
01:10:27,071 --> 01:10:33,215
I'm supported by the people man no-one secretly paying me off at the same time he's taking in billions of dollars from some

1438
01:10:33,471 --> 01:10:35,007
I'm secret donor in digital money

1439
01:10:35,519 --> 01:10:41,151
It's all out of sync and if anyone that Alex criticizes did the same thing percentages dead to rights

1440
01:10:41,663 --> 01:10:46,783
They're getting paid by Klaus Schwab to help kill every 100% play by his own rules

1441
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:51,647
It's fine I think for him to take in a couple million dollars from a crypto donor but he's already

1442
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:53,695
Deserves to know who that person is

1443
01:10:54,207 --> 01:10:58,047
Because they may have some interest or some connections that would be relevant for the audience

1444
01:10:58,303 --> 01:10:58,815
To be aware of

1445
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:03,423
If it's someone like Max Keiser then it obviously comes at the strings of needing Alex

1446
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:04,959
Crypto to his audience

1447
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:07,007
Saski and Max have discussed in the past

1448
01:11:07,775 --> 01:11:09,567
Hit someone like Peter teal then that opens up

1449
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:12,383
Thousand more questions that the audience should be asking

1450
01:11:12,895 --> 01:11:16,991
If it's an online Neo-Nazi or white nationalist type front and that speaks volumes

1451
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:22,111
And if it's just a rich benefactor who believes in the infowar but weirdly didn't step in till now

1452
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:23,391
That's benign

1453
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:24,671
It still should be known

1454
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:27,487
Unless that the owner's identity is known as

1455
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:29,791
It's hard not to make assumptions about who it might be

1456
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:31,071
Agenda Mike

1457
01:11:31,327 --> 01:11:32,607
Come along with that donation

1458
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:36,703
I'm just call on Alex to reveal who does daughter was because otherwise

1459
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:39,007
I don't understand how your audience could ever trust you

1460
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:40,287
Do you ever

1461
01:11:40,543 --> 01:11:42,079
Here's the only way that he

1462
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:43,103
He would talk

1463
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:46,175
Is if we got anywhere from

1464
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:50,271
00012 any number of Bitcoin from anyone

1465
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:56,159
Like secretive donors giving Bitcoin and s***

1466
01:11:56,415 --> 01:11:57,439
I am f******

1467
01:11:57,695 --> 01:11:59,487
Maybe but I still don't think you would

1468
01:11:59,743 --> 01:12:00,511
Such b*******

1469
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:04,095
I understand

1470
01:12:04,351 --> 01:12:05,631
I am guess what I mean

1471
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:07,167
I think

1472
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:12,799
Through the people who are looking into these things over at the splc

1473
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:14,079
Sure and what-have-you I think

1474
01:12:14,335 --> 01:12:15,871
B b

1475
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:17,407
Mystery that gets off

1476
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:20,479
If I were Alex I would get out in front of it

1477
01:12:20,735 --> 01:12:24,063
And just reveal who this person is if it's not a big

1478
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:25,855
Big deal then it's not a big deal right

1479
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:27,903
And the person should be loud as a hero of

1480
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:28,671
Infowars

1481
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:33,023
Of course if it is somebody that it would be suspicious that you're taking

1482
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:35,583
$2000000 in Bitcoin from going to come out

1483
01:12:35,839 --> 01:12:39,679
It is an baby you should come up with a defense for that in advance

1484
01:12:39,935 --> 01:12:42,495
And get ahead of the thing and just reveal who this

1485
01:12:43,007 --> 01:12:43,775
This

1486
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:46,847
I mean he's read the news about Bitcoin

1487
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:50,687
Play but it does feel like if you want to know where a wallet is from

1488
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:52,479
You can find that if

1489
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:53,247
Information

1490
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:56,319
If I don't

1491
01:12:57,343 --> 01:12:59,135
I don't know how either but I doubt someone

1492
01:12:59,391 --> 01:13:03,743
Some people do

1493
01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:08,351
So Alex wants to know why this caller is so interested in

1494
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:09,887
And it gets

1495
01:13:10,655 --> 01:13:11,167
A little angry

1496
01:13:11,935 --> 01:13:12,959
Let me ask you this why

1497
01:13:13,215 --> 01:13:15,007
Why are you upset about Trump right now

1498
01:13:15,519 --> 01:13:16,799
Why are you trying to hammer him

1499
01:13:18,847 --> 01:13:19,615
Because I believe that

1500
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:23,199
If this time is still holding on to their weapon

1501
01:13:23,711 --> 01:13:24,479
Their main weapon

1502
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:26,527
And I was at

1503
01:13:26,783 --> 01:13:27,295
The capital

1504
01:13:27,807 --> 01:13:30,879
And I was there

1505
01:13:31,135 --> 01:13:33,951
Ready to go I would have done it any day and Trump had the chance

1506
01:13:34,207 --> 01:13:34,975
He had

1507
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:36,255
Bosc pear

1508
01:13:36,511 --> 01:13:37,023
He had

1509
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:39,839
1776 in his hands

1510
01:13:41,887 --> 01:13:42,655
Any cars back

1511
01:13:47,519 --> 01:13:48,031
Disagree with you

1512
01:13:51,615 --> 01:13:52,127
Good call

1513
01:13:54,175 --> 01:13:54,943
Wow

1514
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:57,247
Alex doesn't like hearing somebody say what he

1515
01:13:58,015 --> 01:13:59,295
Yeah it's it's

1516
01:13:59,551 --> 01:14:00,831
I was kind of shocked

1517
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:04,159
Icrew

1518
01:14:04,415 --> 01:14:05,695
You should say

1519
01:14:06,207 --> 01:14:07,231
Too logical

1520
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:13,631
No you said you should feel betrayed by the guy who betrayed you seems like it should not

1521
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:15,423
Yeah, it's a complex

1522
01:14:15,935 --> 01:14:18,751
Place to get to home I was betrayed I feel that way

1523
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:21,055
Seems a lot

1524
01:14:21,311 --> 01:14:23,359
Less performed he's pissed

1525
01:14:23,615 --> 01:14:25,151
Agree with him he got

1526
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:26,943
Listen to believe it b******* and then he got

1527
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:29,247
A trait that so Alex disagrees cuz he thinks

1528
01:14:29,503 --> 01:14:30,271
Too bad strategy

1529
01:14:30,783 --> 01:14:33,087
I am so after he's hung up on the guy he

1530
01:14:45,631 --> 01:14:48,191
Going to Sky and Washington Sky walking around here

1531
01:14:50,495 --> 01:14:51,519
Hello sir thank you

1532
01:14:52,031 --> 01:14:57,919
I just want to stay I really respect on and I want to Echo everything all your previous callers that's backed up

1533
01:14:58,175 --> 01:14:59,199
Last caller

1534
01:14:59,455 --> 01:15:03,551
But it's okay to have disagreements I respect that

1535
01:15:03,807 --> 01:15:04,319
Thank you after

1536
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:06,111
Is questions really well

1537
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:10,463
And you're doing a great show today Alex not he's not

1538
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:15,839
Alex has to agree to disagree with this guy because he can't actually before him and he campy again

1539
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:16,607
Got them

1540
01:15:16,863 --> 01:15:21,215
If Alex agrees with that collar than his actions on January 6th and every day sent to make no

1541
01:15:21,983 --> 01:15:22,751
Why would Alex have been

1542
01:15:23,263 --> 01:15:25,823
Trying to calm the crowd if he agreed with this collar

1543
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:28,383
Quality claim that antifa was behind all this

1544
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:32,223
Simultaneously he can't disagree with him because he knows that a whole lot of his audience

1545
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:34,015
Feel the same way that caller does

1546
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:36,575
This color is the True Believer

1547
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:38,367
Let's being wound up by the con artists

1548
01:15:38,623 --> 01:15:41,183
That's like Alex said provoked

1549
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:42,463
Conflict or outright

1550
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:44,767
Condemn this guy's perspective even if you

1551
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:47,071
Even if you pretend to disagree

1552
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:47,839
That's too dangerous

1553
01:15:48,607 --> 01:15:51,167
I would literally it is literally too dangerous

1554
01:15:51,423 --> 01:15:55,007
That guy was ready to overthrow the country exactly

1555
01:15:55,263 --> 01:16:00,127
Yeah we have a conversation with this guy and disagree with him coherently

1556
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:02,943
It would have been a bad strategy to

1557
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:04,223
Take the White House

1558
01:16:04,735 --> 01:16:07,295
What strategies Alex pursuing that's so much better

1559
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:13,951
Having violent mood swings on are covering being with headlines on stories he hasn't read and wait

1560
01:16:14,207 --> 01:16:15,743
Super rich guy to give him Millions

1561
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:20,095
The temporarily bail him out of trouble while he waits for the Sandy Hook cases to get a new court date

1562
01:16:20,607 --> 01:16:22,399
Where's the strategy the midterms

1563
01:16:23,935 --> 01:16:27,519
What is the better strategy

1564
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:30,847
Strategy to admit that you tried to overthrow the f****** cap

1565
01:16:31,103 --> 01:16:32,895
Here's what's good strategy

1566
01:16:33,151 --> 01:16:35,455
Lie as much as you can obfuscated much

1567
01:16:35,711 --> 01:16:38,271
You can put blame on as many people as you can

1568
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:43,391
Until people forget about it as long as possible and then you get your second shot at overthrowing the gun

1569
01:16:43,903 --> 01:16:44,415
Alex's

1570
01:16:44,927 --> 01:16:49,791
Alex is strategy is the same as Tucker Carlson a Miss f****** Mitch McConnell strategy

1571
01:16:50,047 --> 01:16:56,191
This is terrible is probably somebody else's fault and if it was don't investigate it don't worry about it we'll never think about it again in 3 years

1572
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:59,263
Is this definitely not going to happen again promise guarantee it no way

1573
01:17:00,543 --> 01:17:01,311
Right

1574
01:17:01,823 --> 01:17:04,127
But still it's bad strategy for Alex's busy

1575
01:17:04,639 --> 01:17:05,407
Yes that is

1576
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:09,759
Agree with the guy

1577
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:16,159
Because arguing on this point exposes his ass so he gets him off of line and then agrees to disagree respecting their differing

1578
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:21,791
Keep in mind all the other folk that he refuses to agree to disagree with

1579
01:17:22,047 --> 01:17:22,559
But this guy

1580
01:17:22,815 --> 01:17:25,375
Who's mad that Trump didn't lead a charge into the White House

1581
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:26,655
To overthrow the country

1582
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:28,447
That deserves our respect

1583
01:17:28,703 --> 01:17:29,727
Sexual position and

1584
01:17:31,007 --> 01:17:36,383
Also notice and Alex isn't against a literally taken country over because that would be a bad thing to do

1585
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:37,407
It's just bad strategy

1586
01:17:38,431 --> 01:17:39,199
The goal isn't bad

1587
01:17:39,455 --> 01:17:40,479
The end result isn't bad

1588
01:17:40,735 --> 01:17:44,575
He just doesn't think that with the color wanted would have brought about that end result

1589
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:46,111
Paul Robeson

1590
01:17:46,367 --> 01:17:47,391
January 6th stuff though

1591
01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:49,951
I just wanted to bring up something that Alex probably won't touch

1592
01:17:50,463 --> 01:17:54,815
William Todd Wilson Bo keeper who plead guilty just had a statement of affect

1593
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:58,655
Released and it looks pretty bad for Alex's buddy Stewart Roads

1594
01:17:58,911 --> 01:18:01,471
A lot of this stuff is providing more insight in

1595
01:18:01,727 --> 01:18:04,543
The things that we've already known but there's some added stuff in here to

1596
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:05,567
Princeton

1597
01:18:05,823 --> 01:18:09,919
At about 5 p.m. on January 6th Stewart was back at his hotel where this happen

1598
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:13,503
Quote roads then called an individual over speakerphone

1599
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:15,807
Wilson heard roads were

1600
01:18:16,063 --> 01:18:22,207
Heatedly implore the individual to tell President Trump to call upon groups like The Oath Keepers to forcibly oppose the transfer

1601
01:18:22,463 --> 01:18:22,975
Terrapower

1602
01:18:23,487 --> 01:18:25,279
This individual denied roses request

1603
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:27,071
How to speak directly with President Trump

1604
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:28,863
After the call ended roads

1605
01:18:29,375 --> 01:18:30,143
Stated to the group

1606
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:31,167
I just want to

1607
01:18:32,447 --> 01:18:34,495
Chili curious who that individual might be

1608
01:18:35,263 --> 01:18:37,311
Someone whose acquainted with Trump and Stewart

1609
01:18:37,567 --> 01:18:39,103
And is on good enough terms of both

1610
01:18:39,359 --> 01:18:41,151
Both of them for Stewartsville come

1611
01:18:41,407 --> 01:18:42,175
For making this request

1612
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:44,223
A store to assume they could

1613
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:45,759
Could get Trump in on the loop

1614
01:18:46,015 --> 01:18:47,295
I don't assume that's a giant

1615
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:48,575
Group of people

1616
01:18:50,367 --> 01:18:52,927
I don't I'm not saying it is Rodger or Alex

1617
01:18:53,183 --> 01:18:55,487
But like the else would it be

1618
01:18:55,743 --> 01:18:58,559
No I don't I mean no it should be

1619
01:18:59,071 --> 01:18:59,839
I don't know

1620
01:19:00,095 --> 01:19:01,631
Who in Trump's orbit

1621
01:19:01,887 --> 01:19:02,911
Would be in

1622
01:19:03,167 --> 01:19:06,239
Direct contact Network Road the phone

1623
01:19:06,495 --> 01:19:07,519
365

1624
01:19:08,287 --> 01:19:09,567
Like I don't know who that would be

1625
01:19:09,823 --> 01:19:11,615
Nobody nobody in trumps

1626
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:14,431
Actual government circle is picking us up.

1627
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:15,967
It seems like

1628
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:18,271
I don't

1629
01:19:18,527 --> 01:19:24,671
Exclude any possibilities information

1630
01:19:25,183 --> 01:19:26,207
Sure

1631
01:19:26,463 --> 01:19:27,231
I don't know

1632
01:19:31,839 --> 01:19:32,607
Yeah it's it's

1633
01:19:32,863 --> 01:19:35,935
That's a question that I'm very curious about what the answer is

1634
01:19:36,703 --> 01:19:37,471
Alex probably

1635
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:39,263
I do I be worried

1636
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:42,079
Hey wait I we get another call and

1637
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:46,687
Remember how Alex gave it up to the legends on that mopey goodbye episode sure

1638
01:19:46,943 --> 01:19:47,967
You forgot somebody

1639
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:50,271
But any case I wanted to bring up

1640
01:19:50,783 --> 01:19:53,855
Last week when you were going down memory lane

1641
01:19:54,111 --> 01:19:57,439
And I thought Jim Tucker should have been mentioned

1642
01:20:01,535 --> 01:20:02,559
Bringing the Bilderberg

1643
01:20:03,071 --> 01:20:04,095
To the Forefront

1644
01:20:05,375 --> 01:20:06,143
And

1645
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:09,215
I decided it would be great to

1646
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:11,007
Mention him as well

1647
01:20:13,567 --> 01:20:14,592
On your show

1648
01:20:16,384 --> 01:20:17,152
Absolutely

1649
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:20,992
Amazing Nasher also Nazi

1650
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:24,064
I do like

1651
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:27,648
Two things about this one the idea that like a friendship Tucker

1652
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:28,672
Realized

1653
01:20:30,208 --> 01:20:31,744
Then the second thing to us that she thinks

1654
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:35,072
That was a walking down memory lane that's yeah.

1655
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:41,984
It always is my life

1656
01:20:43,008 --> 01:20:44,032
Do you recognize that

1657
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:46,848
But no one's doing it for him cuz no one gives us

1658
01:20:47,104 --> 01:20:48,640
I am amazed

1659
01:20:49,152 --> 01:20:50,176
At the salt process

1660
01:20:51,712 --> 01:20:52,736
Get to calling

1661
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:54,016
Alex Jones

1662
01:20:54,528 --> 01:20:55,296
Days after

1663
01:20:56,064 --> 01:20:56,576
The fact

1664
01:20:57,088 --> 01:20:59,648
About something that he does not remember or care about

1665
01:20:59,904 --> 01:21:02,208
It was a lie

1666
01:21:02,464 --> 01:21:03,488
I mean why

1667
01:21:03,744 --> 01:21:05,024
Why do you feel like

1668
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:06,048
Jim Tucker needs

1669
01:21:06,304 --> 01:21:06,816
To be on that

1670
01:21:07,072 --> 01:21:09,120
Maybe this is Jim's Widow

1671
01:21:10,144 --> 01:21:16,288
I don't know cuz I could make

1672
01:21:17,056 --> 01:21:20,128
Say Jim say gym

1673
01:21:20,384 --> 01:21:23,968
How to give a magnet have to call an elf

1674
01:21:24,224 --> 01:21:24,992
Regularly

1675
01:21:25,248 --> 01:21:28,320
Yeah she does say that she's a very long-term there we go

1676
01:21:28,576 --> 01:21:32,672
Also she did say that she was at Bilderberg with Alex protesting

1677
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:33,696
That means

1678
01:21:33,952 --> 01:21:34,464
Remind me

1679
01:21:37,536 --> 01:21:38,048
Pennywise

1680
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:41,120
That would make sense

1681
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:42,144
Alex has a guest

1682
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:44,704
For most of the third hour give you a

1683
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:45,472
A guess

1684
01:21:48,544 --> 01:21:51,104
Chantilly Lace with a pretty feet

1685
01:21:51,616 --> 01:21:52,128
Pete Santilli

1686
01:21:54,176 --> 01:21:55,712
I don't care about this guy

1687
01:21:56,736 --> 01:21:58,528
Always a radio host who talked about him

1688
01:21:58,784 --> 01:21:59,808
Before

1689
01:22:00,576 --> 01:22:01,600
You know he also

1690
01:22:01,856 --> 01:22:03,392
Yes but you also I hate

1691
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:04,416
Stewart Rhodes

1692
01:22:04,672 --> 01:22:05,952
The two of them hate each other

1693
01:22:06,208 --> 01:22:07,488
Valic is still having him on

1694
01:22:07,744 --> 01:22:09,792
Amanda ignoring news that implicates

1695
01:22:10,816 --> 01:22:12,096
It tried to overthrow the government

1696
01:22:12,352 --> 01:22:14,656
Anyway it's about the UN

1697
01:22:14,912 --> 01:22:15,424
Pandemic

1698
01:22:17,472 --> 01:22:18,240
Pete Santilli

1699
01:22:18,496 --> 01:22:21,568
Investigative journalist

1700
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:22,848
I have spent

1701
01:22:24,384 --> 01:22:24,896
Months

1702
01:22:25,664 --> 01:22:26,944
Reading documents

1703
01:22:27,968 --> 01:22:30,016
Researching what's happening

1704
01:22:30,272 --> 01:22:32,064
Geneva Switzerland

1705
01:22:32,832 --> 01:22:34,624
The 22nd the 28th

1706
01:22:35,136 --> 01:22:36,928
Thomas Reed

1707
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:40,512
The UN will control

1708
01:22:44,096 --> 01:22:44,608
Just like

1709
01:22:44,864 --> 01:22:45,632
UNESCO

1710
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:49,216
Education policy the rest of it

1711
01:22:49,728 --> 01:22:51,264
We're under you and control the flow

1712
01:22:53,568 --> 01:22:55,104
Did our government sign treaties with it

1713
01:22:55,616 --> 01:22:56,896
And no wonder its control

1714
01:22:57,408 --> 01:22:59,968
Congress Avenue

1715
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:03,040
Because he plans to implement all of this week

1716
01:23:03,296 --> 01:23:03,808
Have to make this

1717
01:23:04,064 --> 01:23:05,856
The central issue PE got cut off

1718
01:23:06,368 --> 01:23:07,136
Please continue

1719
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:12,000
Everybody should understand

1720
01:23:12,768 --> 01:23:17,888
Existential threat I'm going to lay this out as follows

1721
01:23:20,448 --> 01:23:21,216
Thought we couldn't

1722
01:23:21,472 --> 01:23:22,496
Stop any of this

1723
01:23:22,752 --> 01:23:26,080
My God

1724
01:23:26,336 --> 01:23:29,408
Annual World Health assembly run by the World Health Organization

1725
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:35,296
It doesn't seem like this treaty is definitely going to be dealt with there

1726
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:41,184
Although there is a plan for this to be there's a treaty that the EU is working on

1727
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:42,720
International pandemic

1728
01:23:42,976 --> 01:23:45,024
Responses

1729
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:51,424
The plan then everyone agrees with negotiations it seems incredibly ambitious it might be adopted sometime

1730
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:52,704
2024

1731
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:57,312
Part of their plan is delivering a progress report at next year's

1732
01:23:57,568 --> 01:23:58,592
26th annual

1733
01:23:58,848 --> 01:23:59,872
World Health assembly

1734
01:24:00,128 --> 01:24:00,640
Take place next

1735
01:24:01,408 --> 01:24:05,248
Conspiracy about this and Jim Fetzer has been spreading

1736
01:24:05,504 --> 01:24:10,624
Stuff about it since last a great good news like Alex might be back on his bullshitted news

1737
01:24:12,416 --> 01:24:16,512
Luna International bodies are talking about how they can

1738
01:24:16,768 --> 01:24:20,608
Collaborated means

1739
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:21,888
It's just boring

1740
01:24:22,144 --> 01:24:23,936
It's just a boring conference

1741
01:24:24,448 --> 01:24:25,472
For boring

1742
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:28,032
Everything is their main attack

1743
01:24:28,288 --> 01:24:29,056
I noticed that

1744
01:24:29,824 --> 01:24:30,848
What are mean how many made

1745
01:24:31,104 --> 01:24:32,128
Attacks are we on here

1746
01:24:32,384 --> 01:24:32,896
Somali

1747
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:34,688
What is their main attack

1748
01:24:34,944 --> 01:24:36,224
If it's this meeting

1749
01:24:36,992 --> 01:24:37,504
How is it

1750
01:24:38,528 --> 01:24:41,088
The other things that he said is their main attack

1751
01:24:43,648 --> 01:24:45,440
And he didn't say those things and you can't prove it

1752
01:24:45,696 --> 01:24:51,840
I have to release this

1753
01:24:52,096 --> 01:24:53,632
Episodes I can go back

1754
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:55,680
How to get rid The Archives

1755
01:24:57,216 --> 01:25:01,824
We have one last trip here and was really boring but when they come back

1756
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:06,432
Into the last segment Alex has a little bit of what I would describe as

1757
01:25:06,688 --> 01:25:08,480
A mini fake outburst

1758
01:25:08,736 --> 01:25:10,016
And then

1759
01:25:16,672 --> 01:25:22,816
Gentleman I wanna be very very clear right now with all of you

1760
01:25:23,072 --> 01:25:25,376
Phillip Powers everything you talked about came through no I do

1761
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:29,728
There's nothing more frustrating than reading levels documents

1762
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:31,776
And watching clips of their speeches

1763
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:34,336
For 30 years on their 28

1764
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:37,664
Knowing they're in power and knowing you're doing this

1765
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:39,456
Weather

1766
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:41,248
Or not they even exist

1767
01:25:44,576 --> 01:25:46,624
I didn't know that they made the weapon

1768
01:25:47,136 --> 01:25:49,696
Members of my family almost killed my dad

1769
01:25:50,208 --> 01:25:50,976
You almost killed her

1770
01:25:51,232 --> 01:25:53,536
Come back and don't even worse

1771
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:04,032
Back to 1776 but not the British winning

1772
01:26:04,288 --> 01:26:05,824
The New World Order winning

1773
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:10,176
What is hell in the lockdowns the starvation that comes with it

1774
01:26:10,688 --> 01:26:11,712
We have to stop

1775
01:26:11,968 --> 01:26:12,736
This folks

1776
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:18,112
What is

1777
01:26:22,208 --> 01:26:26,816
I'm the lucky most the rest of segments

1778
01:26:27,072 --> 01:26:31,168
So he just has peed how's the respite

1779
01:26:31,424 --> 01:26:35,264
Emotional

1780
01:26:37,312 --> 01:26:43,456
They killed my dad

1781
01:26:43,712 --> 01:26:44,992
I can't deal with that

1782
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:46,272
Anyways

1783
01:26:46,528 --> 01:26:48,064
Can you do my job also like

1784
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:48,832
Again

1785
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:50,112
We

1786
01:26:50,368 --> 01:26:52,416
Their plans on stoppable now you can't stop

1787
01:26:53,184 --> 01:26:59,328
Stop giving people fake hope that they can stop something just because you feel better cuz I have a couple million dollars I'll tell you this plans on south of

1788
01:26:59,584 --> 01:27:01,632
Google now you said that concretely definitively

1789
01:27:02,912 --> 01:27:04,704
Dick I mean you're trying to stop

1790
01:27:05,728 --> 01:27:06,752
90% of the people

1791
01:27:07,008 --> 01:27:07,776
From dying

1792
01:27:08,032 --> 01:27:09,056
So only 50

1793
01:27:10,592 --> 01:27:11,616
Here's the thing

1794
01:27:11,872 --> 01:27:12,384
You can't be

1795
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:14,944
You can't have that good of an attitude it's only 50

1796
01:27:16,224 --> 01:27:16,992
Let me interpret this

1797
01:27:18,272 --> 01:27:22,624
Alex is so hungry that he can't wait 10 more minutes to get off are you still hungry

1798
01:27:23,648 --> 01:27:25,184
But I've done better acting

1799
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:28,000
Getting out of a you f****** fryer job

1800
01:27:30,304 --> 01:27:30,816
Yeah man

1801
01:27:31,072 --> 01:27:33,888
This is weird because this episode wasn't

1802
01:27:34,144 --> 01:27:35,680
All about the Roe versus Wade thing

1803
01:27:35,936 --> 01:27:39,008
No it wasn't as much even about that as you might've

1804
01:27:39,264 --> 01:27:39,776
Expect

1805
01:27:40,032 --> 01:27:40,544
Like

1806
01:27:41,056 --> 01:27:43,616
Certainly there's there's some conversation about it

1807
01:27:43,872 --> 01:27:44,384
Share some

1808
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:47,456
It's Dom

1809
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:50,272
Normalize Alex show

1810
01:27:50,528 --> 01:27:51,808
In the midst of

1811
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:54,624
Huge nose and

1812
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:58,464
Untethered emotional bulshit from here

1813
01:28:01,024 --> 01:28:07,168
So yeah maybe maybe he's just found a state of normalcy within the the chaos

1814
01:28:09,216 --> 01:28:11,008
I don't know what it feels like

1815
01:28:11,264 --> 01:28:15,360
To suddenly get $2000000 but I imagine that would

1816
01:28:15,872 --> 01:28:17,664
Change your kind of Outlook

1817
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:20,480
You know the only way I can get text realize it is in like

1818
01:28:21,248 --> 01:28:22,016
Little

1819
