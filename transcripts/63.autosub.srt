59
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:48,096
Unfortunately I had when I was

00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,632
I was only able to get about

61
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:50,656

To2015 way more

70
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:14,720
More it's less painful cuz it's

71
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,024
It's almost nostalgic now

72
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,143
Anticipation there's excitement of what are we going to do

73
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:22,911
Discover

74
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:23,935

75
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:27,519

We're just going to listen to him rationalize

78
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:40,831
What's going to happen on this episode

79
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:44,671
Make excuses for the trumps anymore

80
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:46,463
Crabby

81
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:49,023
What else what else could he do like

82
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:55,167
Just bail on the whole thing like

83
00:04:55,423 --> 00:05:01,567
Like no like strawberry soda style hard on YouTube

84
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:10,015
Never speak of it again

85
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:13,855
I think

86
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:17,183
Europe

87
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:20,255
You have gone way too far

88
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,327
He could do that but I think they're going to

89
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,607
To be lingering consequence

90
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:26,399
He's done in the last

91
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,447
Yeah but his

92
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,263
His way of surviving is going to be

93
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,311
He can't

94
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:36,127
He can't turn against against

95
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,919
He's got to pull up Sandy Hook

96
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:38,687
Play

97
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:40,991
Look we just have debates about Trump

98
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:45,087
Five years from now that's going to be his story

99
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,111
Debative

100
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:50,463
I I sucked his info.

101
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:56,607
That's his way of saying he's not promoting infowar

102
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:59,423
I know it hasn't worked out the way we wanted

103
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:05,823
But that's because he was corrupt he touch the touch the glowing orb

104
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:07,871
I told him not to

105
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09,407
Rockefeller building map

106
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:11,199
Orbs have power

107
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:17,599

There's a recording of a phone conversation

110
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:25,535
Between Alex

111
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:28,863
Drop

112
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:29,631
Night

113
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:34,495
Don't you dare touch that or it's just the middle of the night

114
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,543
Trump doesn't take out the cat

Let's get to it Jordan

121
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,495
What's the Jump Right In This is how Alex Jones

122
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,263
What's the show

123
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,287
On

124
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,311
12

125
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,335
27

126
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:15,455
I have total proof

127
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:18,015
Put this entire attack on Donald Trump jr.

128
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,807
Is a total hoax

129
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,231
Because it's the end for them

130
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,327
They're losing control

131
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:37,983
That's a Republican

132
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:42,079
Don't cares about Joe Scarborough

133
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:44,127
Also let me ask you this

134
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:50,015
She's f****** one gives a s*** about

135
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:56,415
The very next time the Republicans are like

136
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:05,887
You heard Alex start the show by saying he has

137
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:09,471
Total proof

138
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:10,239
Let me ask

139
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:11,775
Do you think

140
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:12,543
Key.

141
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:15,615
You know what

142
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,663
Because

143
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,223
I'm a dreamer

144
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,807
You can get deported

145
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,391
You better not say that on the public broadcast

146
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:33,023
Entertain the fans

147
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:33,791
Total proof

148
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:35,839
Bach

149
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:38,143
Wow I

150
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,471
For those of you like I can't imagine who you might be

151
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:47,871
Doesn't know what this is about Donald Trump

152
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:54,271
That's the best thing you could do you are woefully uninformed

153
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:59,647
The New York Times David Brooks's win the New York Times

154
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:04,511
I'm not saying that he should be a negative thing should happen

155
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,071
Through the cause of other

156
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,095
Doing it

157
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:10,911
Karma is real

158
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,191
He will choke to death

159
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,215

I call him was the definition of gauche

163
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:27,295
I use that sort of blurry

164
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:30,111
Krowd

00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:36,511
Arco

166
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,815
Trump jr.

167
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:39,839
Is really dumb

168
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,119
And there's no way around that

169
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:42,655
He

170
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:46,495
Was involved in a meeting back in July

171
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:47,263

172
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,823

They are corresponding

187
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:16,959
It's between him and a gentleman by the name of Rob Goldstone

188
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:19,007

00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:34,623
His dad is that an oligarch who is very rich

195
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,183
Is a close associate of both

196
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,975
Putin and Donald Trump

197
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:42,815
Yeah so do junior get this email

198
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:44,607

And conveniently Alex Jones Fox News

200
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,471
Don't

201
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,519
Actually talk about what

202
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,543
In the email

203
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,567
Feel like

204
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,335
It's very important

205
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:56,127
Nope so here I will read it

206
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:56,895
Here

207
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:59,455
So we will be above all the

208
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:01,247
Good morning

209
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,783
Eamon just called

210
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:05,087
And asked me to contact you with something very interest

211
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:08,671
The crown prosecutor of Russia which apparently is the real possess

212
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:16,095
Baby basically

213
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:18,911
The crown prosecutor of Russia

214
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:19,935
His father ARIS

215
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:20,703
This morning

216
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,471
And

217
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:25,055
In their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents

218
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,847
Information that would incriminate Hillary

219
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,919
And her dealings with Russia and be very useful to your father

220
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:33,247
This is obviously very high-level and sensitive information

221
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:35,295
But is part of Russia and the government

222
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,831
Supportive for mr. Trump

223
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,367
Helped Along by Eros

224
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:41,439
What do you think is the best way to handle this information

225
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,719
And would you be able to speak to

226
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,743
Batman about it directly

227
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,279
Now the important piece

228
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:46,559
Is

229
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:49,631
This is obviously very high-level and sensitive information

230
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:50,655
But is a

231
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:53,983
The part of Russia and government support for mr. Trump

232
00:11:54,495 --> 00:12:00,639
That part is been cut out of Fox News that little Chiron

233
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,663
Where they have like

234
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:04,735
Yeah

235
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:05,503
Where

236
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:09,087
Like that's amazing thing for them to do where it's like

237
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,623
We have the first part of the

238
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,951
And then the last part of the

239
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:15,999
At least

240
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:18,303
At least try

241
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,071
Anymore

242
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:21,119
Donald Trump

243
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:25,727
Junior right back I'm on the road at the moment

244
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,519
I just speak to Eman first

245
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:28,799
Seems we have

246
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:29,567
Sometime in

247
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:32,127
If it's what you say I love it

248
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,919
Especially later in the summer

249
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:36,991
Why because that would be the time when it's more politically damaging

250
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:39,295
Call First

251
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,831
Thing next week when I'm back

252
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,879
So they write

253
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:43,903
A little bit

254
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:48,511

P.m.

00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:06,431
Schedule a meeting with you and the Russian government

261
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:08,223
Attorney who's flying over

262
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:09,247
For Moscow for this

263
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,015
This Thursday

264
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,807
I believe you're aware of the meeting

265
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:15,647
I'm still wondered is 3 p.m. or later on Thursday works for you

266
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:17,439
I assumed it would be at your office

267
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,999

268
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:20,767

Thanks Rob I appreciate you helping

271
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,351
Set it up

272
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:25,631
So

273
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:29,727
The issue out nail so right back into the great it'll like

274
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,007
Sleepy Paul manafort

276
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:37,151
Threats

277
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:40,479
Palmetto Ford

278
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:41,247
The address

279
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,271
It's at Trump

280
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:48,415
You know where it is you checked in on Facebook you dumb dumb

281
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:53,023
Really comes up about this

282
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,047
Is

283
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:54,815
In this email

284
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:55,583
Caltrain

285
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,631
Rob Goldstone make

286
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,655
Perfectly clear

287
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,679
But this is about

288
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:00,447
The government's

289
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,471
The Russian

290
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:02,751
Support of Donald Trump

291
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:05,311
Campaign and the person you'd be meeting with is

292
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,335
Is a government lawyer

293
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:08,383
Or a lawyer connected with the government

294
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,407
So

295
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,431
Let's take

296
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,967
Everything out of the equation

297
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:13,503
Let's say worse

298
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,783
Case scenario

299
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,575
This is a democratic

300
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:18,623
Plot it's a globalist plot

301
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:25,023
Let's just say that for me to set up Donald Trump jr.

302
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,071
Once again my Narrative of course

303
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,351
Is that Obama

304
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:34,239
Is the reason we have in order to punish white people for all the things that they did

305
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,775
Got robbed Goldstone

306
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:38,079
These emails to Donald Trump jr.

307
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:42,687
Is no Russian lawyer

308
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,991
Do it himself because Obama

309
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,015
Is Brillion

310
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:52,671
Through at least 45 channels of plausible deniability

311
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,695
Obama used

312
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:54,463
Signal

313
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:58,303
You can't get my emails

314
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,583
At the very least

315
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,887
It's like George George George

316
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:04,703
Speaking in the Royal Oak

317
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,495
Pluralism

318
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:11,359
The Entity known as Obama Obama

319
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:14,943
Cutouts

320
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,271
Donald Trump Jr probably committed a crime

321
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,039
Even

322
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:23,135
There is no other person on the other end of this

323
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,671
Broke because he

324
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,487
What he indicated

325
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:28,255
Willingness

326
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,279
To accept

327
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,327
Confidential information

328
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:37,215
Empower guys are less

329
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,495
Gullible

330
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,543
Donald Trump

331
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,335
The further problem

332
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:46,175
I would say the bigger issue is

333
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,967
That there's timestamps on this

334
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:50,783
You can trace back what was going on around

335
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:53,599
The campaign

336
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:55,135
Yeah and

337
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,927
June 7th

338
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:00,255
During the afternoon

339
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,023
Formalize

340
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:03,071
This meeting that they were going to have

341
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:06,399
Next week

342
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:08,447
I'm going to lay out

343
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,471
The truth about Hillary

344
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:12,287
That can't be

345
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:14,335
If you could that be

346
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,967
It lays out the truth about Hillary

347
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:21,503
Further

348
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,039
Because it's

349
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:23,807
Timestamp

350
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:24,575
On

351
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:26,879
And the third

352
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:29,439
And because

353
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,975
Is Jared Kushner

354
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:32,255
Are all day

355
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,583
But they can really claim

356
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:36,607
At any point

357
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:39,423
Ask them they didn't know that the Russian government

358
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,703
Had a preference

359
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,495
For Donald Trump to be

360
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,823
But were they BCC

361
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:53,247
How are these people

362
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:59,903
Email dude I mean the the biggest thing for me is that

363
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:02,207
You know there is awareness that is

364
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,999
Solidified

365
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:06,559
They have to know that the Russian government wants

366
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,631
And that makes every statement

367
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:12,191
No idea alive

368
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:13,215
I passed that point

369
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:14,495
And because they have

370
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:16,031
Consistently lied weather is

371
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:17,823
Or

372
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,103
In public

373
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:19,871
Speeches

374
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:23,455
Every time they lied is an opportunity for blackmail to

375
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:25,503
To be created by Vladimir Putin

376
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:28,831
Any other hostile entity may be a mop

377
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,111
Of some sort that has ax

378
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:31,647
Information

379
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:33,951
Consortium

380
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:39,839
Coast might be the frontman for maybe laundering money for

381
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,375
Crazy f***** up stuff

382
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,399
And it's

383
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,423
Not a hoax

384
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:45,471
The park

385
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:47,007
Might want to focus on

386
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:51,359
He might be able to dance hope circles around the reality

387
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:52,639
And it's

388
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:56,479
It's Donald Trump jr. release these email

389
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:57,759
It's dark pink

390
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:00,319
This isn't some sort of like

391
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:01,855
He said she said

392
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:04,671
Sources say

393
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:05,695
Straight from him

394
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:06,975
Right

395
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:09,791
No it is here's my

396
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:10,815
My question

397
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:14,143
The emails were coming

398
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:19,519
Junior

399
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,079
Is he actually stood

400
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:22,847
Stupid for release

401
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:23,615
Bring them himself

402
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:26,687
Like cuz that's the that's a bit on Twitter it's like

403
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:29,503
Could you be to release these emails

404
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:30,783
Coming out

405
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:37,951
I don't know I don't know enough legally to know if it was smart or not I have no idea

406
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:39,487
But I do think

407
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:42,047
Just being involved in this sort of s*** make

408
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:43,839
Oh yeah

409
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:46,399
What is a dump

410
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,167
Insanity

411
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,191
But I don't know

412
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:48,959
I mean

413
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:54,335
I guess that there's some sort of power you can take him being able to direct the narrative

414
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:55,615
A little bit

415
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,151
Succeeded in doing that

416
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,479
I don't know

417
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:03,807
I don't I don't know I just

418
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,599
For some reason

419
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:07,391
In my head reading this

420
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,671
Reading this whole story

421
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,951
The part of people

422
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:11,487
Clowning on Junior

423
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:13,023
For releasing it

424
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,559
Nothing silly to me

425
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:17,119
Maybe even better

426
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:20,191
Maybe even

427
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:22,239
More stupid for him

428
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:24,031
Is that if he

429
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:24,799
The New York Times

430
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,615
Then they still have your

431
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:33,759
This is bulshit

432
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:35,551
New York

433
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,135
Selfish

434
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:45,791
There's no anti-media narrative

435
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:47,839
You like they're always

436
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:51,679
Anything to take us exactly lose a lot of Leverage

437
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:58,079
They made it up that was the single dumbest thing I've

438
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:58,847
I think I've ever seen

439
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,639
C90

440
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:02,431
New York time

441
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,455
Games to come out with it

442
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:08,575
You give the pro Trump media the crnkovich is in the world

443
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:09,599
Much more to work

444
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:12,927
Exactly as you'll see

445
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:14,975
They don't have a ton to work with on this

446
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:16,767
And Alex's got to do a lot of

447
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:21,119
Right let's get to the next clip

448
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,143
Is human

449
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:25,471
Candy machine

450
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:31,359
Still don't know what that is

451
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:38,783
It's pretending that he doesn't really understand what this is about

452
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:43,135
Well if you look for

453
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:47,231
Every time they give us another Russia nothingburger

454
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:53,631
It doesn't matter how many internal videos we have from CNN MSNBC

455
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:59,519
Not recycling

456
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:04,895
Beauty pageant

457
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:12,575
Last July

458
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:15,135
They just keep recycling the same

459
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:17,440
647 nothing burgers

460
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,256
If we had Donald Trump jr.

461
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,032
Missile secrets to China or Russia

462
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,104
I would say

463
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:40,480
Basically arrest him

464
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:43,552
Okay well at least we go to Baseline

465
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:44,576
Could be used against you

466
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:49,440
Bios later Alex I will be counting the number of

467
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,536
I think the switch that I play

468
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:59,424
Because he doesn't know

469
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:07,104
I think it was somebody higher up from the project Veritas video

470
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:09,920
Said that Russia was a nothing

471
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:10,688
Burger

472
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:14,016
In one of their heavily edited behind the scenes

473
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:18,112
Expose that are inaccurate

474
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:18,880
Should never be believed

475
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:21,952
You've been sued

476
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,256
Successfully for defrauding people

477
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,024
Still not enough

478
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,816
Yeah

479
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:27,840
This is

480
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,120
Alex loves

481
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:30,144
This like

482
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:31,424
This

483
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:32,448
Okay

484
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,216
Here's why

485
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:34,496
2017

486
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:35,776
So f****** boring

487
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:38,592
I know all his tricks already

488
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:41,152
Like

489
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:47,552
Because the most exciting time in the history of American dolls at

490
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:48,320
Time where we

491
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,344
No longer be

492
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:50,880
11

493
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:52,928
Survive

494
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:57,536
Already and it's

495
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:58,816
It's just not

496
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:00,352
Like I like to learn

497
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:05,728
For while we were sort of getting

498
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,544
Engaging with Alex

499
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,104
I'm figuring out what's going on and researching

500
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:11,872
Wingstop

501
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:14,432
I'm sort of getting a sense for his little tricks

502
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:18,528
And the one you did fairies like they just keep recycling stories

503
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:23,136
Recycling not necessarily stories

504
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:23,904
Tactic

505
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:26,976
Cuz this is the same thing you did with the Jeff sessions

506
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,512
Right

507
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:30,304
The same story recycled

508
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,352
A couple months ago

509
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,984
The stories story was lying on his

510
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:40,032
Exactly

511
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:45,408
Music this is the same story was Donald Trump who also committed

512
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:51,296
Are cranes real

513
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:52,576
Okay

514
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:53,344
Good

515
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:54,624
Nope nope

516
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,488
This is a political Grand Theft Auto

517
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,328
What he's doing there is

518
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,120
Harkening back

519
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:06,656
Do a little

520
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,192
Trick a little story

521
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:10,496
But he tells of like they're just recycling stuff

522
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:11,776
As a wave

523
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:12,800
To harken back

524
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:14,080
To what he made that argument

525
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:15,104
Before

526
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:20,480
And there's familiarity in his audiences mind

527
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,808
Rhetorically asked

528
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:24,832
Smart butt

529
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:25,600
The same time

530
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:27,392
It's not at all cuz he doesn't

531
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:29,952
Actually say what the stories are

532
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:32,000
He's pretending that everyone is making

533
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:33,024
A big deal out of

534
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,072
Russia Russia

535
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:36,096
She's already cover

536
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:37,632
And already spun

537
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:38,656
So that

538
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,728
He's basically lowering his work

539
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:42,496
Yeah

540
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:44,288
Very hard

541
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:45,568
Yeah it's being credit

542
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:48,384
But it is

543
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,224
Trump went over to Russia to do a beauty pageant

544
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:57,344
But the bunch

545
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,416
Oh yeah that that is his like way of not dealing

546
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:03,488
Pete on the lake

547
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:06,560
Well he's not going to use that as a way to

548
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:08,096
Bowflex from the Steele dossier

549
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:11,424
He's going to use that as like

550
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:12,704
Not really

551
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:15,008
It's very little about

552
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,336
Is

553
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:26,528
And that's the reason that I got all that

554
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:29,344
Without

555
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:30,880
You know the shift ran

556
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:34,464
Got all that noticeability but nobody's talking about how

557
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,232
He's drunk off of

558
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:42,144
It's exactly the same thing

559
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:43,936
But who cares

560
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,800
It'll it'll come

561
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,848
To be real

562
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:55,456
The other has got to do is

563
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:57,504
Because this story

564
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:59,808
If taken at face value isn't

565
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:01,344
Difficult

566
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:02,368
To argue

567
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,648
Right very difficult

568
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:06,464
What you have to do is you have to attack

569
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,000
The players involved

570
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:09,536
So Alex

571
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:10,560
Does big motifs

572
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:12,352
Operandi is to

573
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:17,984
I used the wrong word there let's say with his bit his tactic is to attack the lawyer

574
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:20,288
The Russian lawyer that was in the meat

575
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,336
I like

576
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:25,664
I like that

577
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,688
Okay because

578
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:27,456
Combines

579
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:30,784
Rusev

580
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:36,160
Sure

581
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:40,256
People over 50

582
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:42,048
Play it's still like in their hearts

583
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:45,120
Right

584
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:45,888
Is

585
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:46,912
Essentially

586
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:49,728
A blameless

587
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:51,520
Most likely

588
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:59,200
In a little bit more down the road but

589
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:00,224
CR Alex

590
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,248
Is First Take On Me

591
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,040
He starts by talking about

592
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:04,064
The difference

593
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,856
Between globalist

594
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,392
And

595
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,976
Astarte's

596
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:16,608
Okay

597
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:31,968
With this Russian lawyer turned out is sucked up with the Kremlin

598
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:38,880
It's true this Russian lawyer

599
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:43,744
Irrigation dirt on Hilary but didn't

600
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:48,096
Infowars.com

601
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:50,656
Right now

602
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:51,936
Not once

603
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:54,240
But at least twice out front

604
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:59,104
Russian light sign

605
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,664
Part of the George soros-funded operation

606
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:04,224
So I say it right

607
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,016
Alex is never will

608
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:06,784
Say it right

609
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,088
One X information

610
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:09,856
From Fortune

611
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:10,880
Which is great

612
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:12,160
Always a great

613
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:14,464
Source of anonymous very fact

614
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,232
Checked in for May

615
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:16,256
Love me some memes

616
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:17,280
But

617
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:19,072
Histamine

618
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:22,656
Even a machine there are pictures

619
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:24,192
Of her

620
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:25,472
Like the women's March

621
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:26,752
Stuff like that

622
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:28,288
I don't know what that mean

623
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,336
I don't I don't know but Alex

624
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:32,640
Seem to not

625
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:34,176
Be thrilled with her

626
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:35,456
First Amendment right

627
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:36,480
Yeah he's not a big fan

628
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:40,064
I don't understand what's the what's the problem with her being at a protest

629
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,344
What's the problem

630
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,624
Like the pictures that I can

631
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,696
Can find it they aren't really dated or time

632
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:49,792
Necessarily

633
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:51,840
As much as they are the woman's March

634
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:56,192
So if she's interested in women's issues

635
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:56,960
It is

636
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:57,984
Wants to

637
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,776
Speak her piece on that

638
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:00,800
That's not

639
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:04,640
In anyway invalidating of her being a Russian lawyer

640
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:05,664
Like

641
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:09,760
George Soros operative just because you went to the women's March I went to the women's March

642
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:13,600
I mean

643
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:17,184
Do you have to be anti

644
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:18,720
I didn't actually go to work

645
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:19,744
I forgot I went to

646
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:21,024
Sorry

647
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,328
Play blood-borne

648
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:28,192
I don't want to claim I did something I didn't you not being able

649
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:32,800
I'm the new meme machine

650
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,640
The women's March

651
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:37,408
Is

652
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:39,456
Not necessarily

653
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,224
Entirely

654
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:43,296
No

655
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,880
It covers the entire Jeep

656
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:48,160
Hayward

657
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:49,696
Have open shoulders

658
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:50,976
It's

659
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:52,000
Being tired

660
00:29:55,328 --> 00:30:00,192
All the all the time I think so

661
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:03,008
Sing there is just putting her at the

662
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,080
90%

663
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:08,640
Male audio

664
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:11,712
Obelisk

665
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,576
It is like

666
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:21,696
PetSmart from his

667
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:26,304
Him talking to

668
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,864
Who is audien

669
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:32,448
So it's a very smart thing when you ever like

670
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:34,240
Indoctrinated dumb old white

671
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:38,848
Unit had right on the nail

672
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,920
Alright

673
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:43,968
You have the the

674
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:46,016
Deeply embedded

675
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:47,552
Subconscious vs. phobia

676
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:50,368
You have the knee-jerk instinct

677
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:51,648
Who support Trump

678
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:52,416
Defend him

679
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:53,952
And think that the media is lying

680
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:55,232
To you

681
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:59,840
I don't I don't f****** know if this is the women's March or an anti-trump March

682
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:00,864
And either way

683
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,680
Women with their tops off

684
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:05,728
Electrical tape on their titties

685
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:12,384
America I want to live in

686
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,880
Was Donald jr. setup

687
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:26,464
Thirsty dozens and dozens of email exchanges

688
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:36,448
It's not.

689
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,776
The Russians and physically

690
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:49,760
That's what Hollywood

691
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:55,648
What what what

692
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:17,920
So I agree with half of the end of that sin

693
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:18,944
Okay

694
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:20,736
Alright

695
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:21,760
But you

696
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:23,040
He's not

697
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:24,064
A secret agent

698
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:25,600
You know like

699
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:30,208
This is where Alex's narrative is completely bonkers

700
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:32,768
And based on some weirdo spy fantasy

701
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:35,584
Donald Trump jr.

702
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,608
No business

703
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,424
Searching out a playing spy games

704
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,960
He has no business to do that

705
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:42,496
If I f******

706
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:45,056
Agent of a foreign power

707
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:47,104
That is hostile to our interest

708
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:47,872
Clearly

709
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:48,640
I mean

710
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:50,176

It won't be long

723
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:17,056

Yeah

727
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:29,856
He's basically the James Bond

728
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:31,136
Play by Woody Allen

729
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:33,952
Do you remember that one

730
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:34,976
Yeah exactly

AccuWeather

736
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,016
Anyone should be playing behind it

737
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:58,784
All of these

738
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:00,832
There's no doubt about it

739
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:02,624
Caper

740
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,904
Comedy of errors

741
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:06,208
But I like

742
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:08,256
If you get this order thing you get

743
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:11,072
I'm not saying this as if any of our listeners are going to

744
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:12,352
To get this kind of offer but

745
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:13,632
You called

746
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:17,984
I got to check this out for myself

747
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,544
Cuz you're not prepared

748
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,568
You're going to

749
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:22,336
Get fool

750
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:23,104
Course you are

751
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:31,296
You keep repeating info.

752
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:32,320
So

753
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:34,880
Call Scott

754
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:35,904
Before

755
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:38,976
Republican candidates

756
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:40,768
Because of course

757
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:42,304
Because of course

758
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,072
Republican

759
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:44,608
Align with

760
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:47,424
Call the FBI

761
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:52,800
People used to America

762
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:56,896
People believing that even if I lose an election

763
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:59,968
I still believe in the rule

764
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:04,832
Now let me also be clear

765
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,904
If Alex Jones is a narrative is correct

766
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:10,720
And this lady was setting up.

767
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:13,792
Lovely still committed a crime

768
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:25,312
That's not been tricked by the globalist

769
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:28,128
Does he not bleed green

770
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,176
Green alien blood

771
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:31,200
So I mean

772
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:33,504
This is not a solid defense

773
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:35,808
Because it doesn't really get the

774
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:36,832
Criminal Intent

775
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:38,112
Out of the equation

776
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:42,208
You still going there thinking he's going to get information

777
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:46,048
It's not entrapment

778
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:47,584
Even if it were like

779
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:49,376
Some sort of Outlaw game

780
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,192
They're not doing making him do anything he's not

781
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:53,472
I'm flying to do to begin with

782
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:55,264
Can't be

783
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:04,480
Rush there still

784
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:12,928
But the other thing

785
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:14,976
That I realized

786
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:17,280
The first until I read over the emails a couple time

787
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:20,096
Is the waves this Rob goats

788
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:21,120
Stone phrases

789
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,680
This is part of

790
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:24,960
Russian government

791
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:26,496
Support of Donald Trump

792
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:27,776
Campaign

793
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:30,848
The way you phrase is it is very tall Society

794
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:33,152
There's already an understanding

795
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:34,432
Between the two of them

796
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:36,224
We all know Russia support

797
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,248
What's Trump

798
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,296
So to me that I mean it's

799
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:41,600
That probably wouldn't hold up in a court of law

800
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:42,368
But

801
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,392
Like

802
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:44,928
Grammatically

803
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,280
Text what they're saying

804
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,096
Taking the piss

805
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:52,864
Pieces out of it

806
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,680
It really tells me that even before June

807
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:56,448
Of 26

808
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:59,776
16 everyone

809
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,312
Together

810
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:03,872
That's really f***** up that's going to be a bigger problem

811
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:07,968
And of course that's why I was just want to bring up that sense

812
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:08,992
So that's that

813
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:09,760
Big

814
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:12,832
Census f*****-up

815
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:14,880
To imagine that that is not

816
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:17,184
Complete

817
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:20,256
Undeniable proof

818
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:22,816
I don't know if it's necessarily trees

819
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:25,376
Cuz I don't know if you're willing

820
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:35,872
The trees you can do trees in anytime you want

821
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:48,416
Alright

822
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:50,720
Where did the like literally hanging by the neck until

823
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:52,768
I know there's not a lot of Preston

824
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:53,792
Denton modern times

825
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:55,328
Anyway

826
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,352
Like I said

827
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:59,936
For us not to watch

828
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,472
No

829
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:03,264
That's on you man

830
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,568
I'm going to I'm going to stay out of this

831
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,872
So you make the argument

832
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:10,944
Yeah but this is incredibly difficult

833
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,480
Context of this email

834
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:13,760
The surrounding

835
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:15,040
Things that happen

836
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:17,856
The end of the speech Trump gave that day

837
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:19,904
The fact that

838
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,184
Infowars

839
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:25,024
Trump started eating out

840
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,840
Hillary's going down

841
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:30,144
Kind of things right around this.

842
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,168
Right

843
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:33,984
Noah

844
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,264
Which previously

845
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,288
They had never

846
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,824
Which is an important

847
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,384
Not.

848
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:44,992
She's going down but this is what the beginning of Hollow Creek prediction exactly

849
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:48,576
Two things which indicate

850
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:50,112
Like we know something

851
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:53,184
But be that as it may

852
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,792
Difficult to make an argument about that it

853
00:38:58,048 --> 00:38:58,560
That's not

854
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,608
So Alex

855
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:01,888
Decides to go up

856
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:03,424
Very bizarre

857
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,448
In terms of Justice

858
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:08,032
He starts

859
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:08,800
Using

860
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:09,568
Trump

861
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,872
Speech that he gave where he asked

862
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:13,664
Russia to hack Hillary Clinton

863
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,712
Wait

864
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:16,992
That's his defense

865
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:20,576
Yeah yeah

866
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:22,112
Invite

867
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:24,928
Yeah is the way you defend against your son

868
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:25,952
Committing

869
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:29,536
I think what he's trying to get

870
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:32,096
But

871
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:37,472
I don't want to put words in his mouth so let's just hear his his version of

872
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:42,592
I get to a clip of Donald Trump

873
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:45,664
A little less

874
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:46,944
Thanks

875
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:53,088
Meeting for 15 minutes 20 minutes

876
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:55,392
Russian lawyer who promised have dirt on Hillary

877
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:56,416
Opposition research

878
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:03,584
At a press conference

879
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:09,728
Nothing about Russia

880
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:12,032
But also

881
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:15,360
It's not true all of those

882
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:17,152
Categorically

883
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:23,296
I don't care who's got the email

884
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:25,088
Who's God

885
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:28,672
Directions

886
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:29,696
Releasing

887
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:32,256
They've been proven not to be illegal

888
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:00,928
Trash

889
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,720
That is incredibly stupid

890
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:04,256
But also

891
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:08,864
He didn't say digital dropbox

892
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:11,424
I am so mad

893
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:17,824
It's right there that's like him talking about Colorado Springs not saying space command

894
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:20,640
So

895
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:23,968
Bility inputting microfiche

896
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:30,368
Or secret plans inside McDonald's wrappers and throwing them

897
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:33,952
But

898
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:38,304
McDonald's

899
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:44,960
Sure throwing away class

900
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:48,032
McDonald's

901
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:49,312
Innocently

902
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:51,360
That brings up a whole host of

903
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:52,895
Questions that I need answers

904
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:54,943
Did you order

905
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:58,783
Do you like the pies what are we talkin

906
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:06,207
The attorney for the MacDonald rapper guy

907
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:12,607
Can say with reasonable certainty that I've never put anything that wasn't McDonald's related in a McDonald's bag

908
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:13,631
Then throw it away

909
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:17,215
McDonough

910
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:22,335
King stuff into a McDonald's bag.

911
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:25,407
To throw it away

912
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:26,431
Treason

913
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:27,711
Treason

914
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:30,015
Here's the thing that I love

915
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:32,831
Here's the thing that I thought

916
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:33,599
Is

917
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:35,135
Is so kind of

918
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:38,463
What am I

919
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:45,375
When he threw the phrase opposition

920
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:47,679
Research and I'm glad you picked up on that

921
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:49,727
Completely normal eyes

922
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:52,031
The problem is that it doesn't

923
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:53,055
No of course

924
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:54,079
Because getting

925
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:55,615
Opposition research

926
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:59,199
From foreign powers hostile foreign powers

927
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:03,807
He's also illegal because foreign entities are not allowed

928
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:04,831
To donate

929
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:05,599
The campaign

930
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:07,903
Add donations don't just come in money

931
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:08,671
They also coming

932
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:12,255
And kind and useful thing

933
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:13,279
No no no

934
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:14,559
Legally they do not

935
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:17,375
Okay so it was about like a golden cat

936
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:19,167
Does that count

937
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:22,239
If you were to what about a nice meal

938
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:24,543
Is he

939
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:26,591
If you were to receive

940
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:27,359
Opposition

941
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:28,639
Research from

942
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:29,919
A Kremlin

943
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:30,687
Connected

944
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:32,223
Would be breaching

945
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:32,991
Campaign Finance

946
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:33,759
Laws

947
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:35,295
So there is a

948
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:36,063
No problem

949
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:37,599
Even with phrasing it like that

950
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:41,439
So

951
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:43,487
If you're listening to

952
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:46,815
That gives

953
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:50,399
Is opposition

954
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:51,167
Research

955
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:53,471
Which implies that everybody

956
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:56,031
False equivalence

957
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:58,079
Between the Steele dossier

958
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:02,431
Opposition research

959
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:03,199
You say dirty.

960
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:06,271
Fortnite

961
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:14,975
Use that as a false equivalence like it was Hillary Clinton

962
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:16,767
Going abroad to try and get up

963
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:20,095
Things that

964
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:27,519
U.s. government

965
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:28,287
Which is what your

966
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:33,407
You're supposed to do. Democratic opposition research

967
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:37,503
It began

968
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:39,295
As I recalled

969
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:40,063
Like

970
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:41,599
The Republican

971
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:44,159
Candidates

972
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:48,511
It's all Republic

973
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:49,535
Temperature

974
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:50,559
But her email

975
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:55,167
This is still on the trumps

976
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:56,191
Each being adjusted

977
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:57,471
While

978
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:01,055
Memory

979
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:07,455
Until they play up on that when it was a Democrat

980
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:10,015
Communist

981
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:19,231
Partially

982
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:27,679
Walmart

983
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:32,543
Tens of millions dead

984
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:37,663
What comes around goes around

985
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:38,431
Karma

986
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:39,967
You reap what you sow

987
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:45,855
Alex Jones

988
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:50,207
Obici Donald jr. did in private

989
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:53,791
What is Father did publicly the search for truth

990
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:56,607
All the search for truth

991
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:57,887
Opposition research

992
00:45:58,655 --> 00:45:59,423
Search for truth

993
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:03,775
Indiana Jones

994
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:04,799
And

995
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:05,567
The Holy Grail

996
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:11,199
I love when Alex Jones gets lost in a metaphor like with the illness

997
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:12,735
Metaphor that he had there

998
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:15,807
Hey cuz he doesn't know how to really connect sauce

999
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:18,623
What's really well

1000
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:20,671
Got it

1001
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:21,695
Globalist

1002
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:24,767
I've got better but gave it to

1003
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:30,911
That's a man who

1004
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:32,191
Experienced a lot of her

1005
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:38,591
What goes around comes around Karma

1006
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:40,895
Come up with four ways to say the same thing

1007
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:41,663
Africa

1008
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:43,967
Learning is

1009
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:45,503
Jesus wear a hat

1010
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:48,319
You're going out don't catch

1011
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:49,087
Cold

1012
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:52,159
If you're going to bumblebee ready to rumble

1013
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:56,255
Has more to say in his next clip about

1014
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:57,279
That clip

1015
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:59,583
Playing it

1016
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:00,607
You give some

1017
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:03,167
Fairly was unwise,

1018
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:04,447
Along the way

1019
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:06,495
Trump

1020
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:10,847
World Junior

1021
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:20,575
New hires

1022
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:22,367
Looking back

1023
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:28,767
Call one

1024
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:37,215
It's just a total deflection

1025
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:41,311
It is so far-fetched it's so ridiculous

1026
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:47,455
Russia has no respect for our country

1027
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:07,935
Countries and competitors

1028
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:09,215
It's a

1029
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:12,287
Disrespect

1030
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:13,567
Country

1031
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:20,479
And the leaders

1032
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:35,327
I hope you're able to

1033
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:38,143
Emails

1034
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:44,287
AR press

1035
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:52,735
Pure instincts of a thoroughbred Real McCoy Americana.

1036
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:53,759
Yikes

1037
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:54,783
What is that mean

1038
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:57,343
I don't know it was a string of words

1039
00:48:58,367 --> 00:48:59,391
Americana

1040
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:01,951
Dyed-in-the-wool

1041
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:03,487
I might be adding ones myself

1042
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:09,887
Listen to his interviews

1043
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:10,655
I don't listen to

1044
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:13,471
And you forcing me to listen

1045
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:15,007
Makes me very angry

1046
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:16,799
I understand what is

1047
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:17,823
Makes me want

1048
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:19,359
To rip off my skin

1049
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:23,455
It is brutal just listening to him

1050
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:32,671
Almost everything he said there is a lot but the other one of the reasons I wanted to

1051
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:33,439
Keep that

1052
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:35,743
Is that there is still

1053
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:40,095
Making a big deal out of the like sort of the idea that he has like

1054
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:41,375
Like a neurodegenerative

1055
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:42,655
Situation

1056
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:47,263
He does sound a lot more coherent than he does in

1057
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:49,567
Any of the interviews that he's done recently

1058
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:52,127
I don't know if that's evidence of anything but he's

1059
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:53,407
Certainly able to

1060
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:54,431
Mostly makes

1061
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:57,247
Sentences and I'm sure it's more like

1062
00:49:57,503 --> 00:50:00,063
Stress-related

1063
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:00,831
Degenerative

1064
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:02,879
Or it could just be

1065
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:04,415
He doesn't like doing the job

1066
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:06,975
People hating in this

1067
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:10,047
Doesn't like

1068
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:11,327
He's just filled with

1069
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:12,863
Anger and rage

1070
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:14,143
Pull it out

1071
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:16,447
He knows he can't throw that out in an interview

1072
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:17,727
So he does that thang like

1073
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:20,287
You know how sometimes when you're so angry

1074
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:21,311
You start to cry

1075
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:22,335
Can't really

1076
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:24,639
Handle your words sort of

1077
00:50:25,663 --> 00:50:26,175
Alright well

1078
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:27,199
Baby

1079
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:35,391
Maybe I'm an angry guy there there's no evidence

1080
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:38,719
Listen to anything

1081
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:45,119
Yeah

1082
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:48,959
The other thing I wanted to bring up is the idea

1083
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:49,727
Just loves it

1084
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:51,775
I love that Alex

1085
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:53,823
The interview and he's like

1086
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:57,151
Junior said he could have done it.

1087
00:50:58,175 --> 00:50:58,943
Would you like

1088
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:01,247
Mistakes were made

1089
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:02,271
What in the hell

1090
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:03,807
Could you have done that differently

1091
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:09,695
Call the FBI

1092
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:14,303
Have a good indication

1093
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:17,119
That there's a reason why they would have never called the

1094
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:17,887
FBI

1095
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:19,935
But

1096
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:21,471
Do you think I love

1097
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:22,751
Is Alex is like

1098
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:27,615
Know what you should done is that God damn right we're talkin to the Russians

1099
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:37,087
Is totally fine

1100
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:38,367
With the idea

1101
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:39,647
That they are

1102
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:40,415
Working with her

1103
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:41,951
They working

1104
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:49,119
Subconsciously a lot of it is Rippling through

1105
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:50,143
Hold back

1106
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:51,679
The damn a little bit

1107
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:53,471
Whenever he starts yelling

1108
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:55,775
It shows it shows those through feeling

1109
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:57,311
I like I don't really give a shih

1110
00:51:57,823 --> 00:52:00,127
Is there working with them I hate Hillary

1111
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:01,407
So much

1112
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:03,455
I think

1113
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:04,223
She

1114
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:05,759
Kill children

1115
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:09,087
It's it's not

1116
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:11,647
He's losing his ability

1117
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:13,183
To pretend he doesn't know thing

1118
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:13,951
Things by the day

1119
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:18,559
That's why I like coming out

1120
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:21,375
In advance for a little bit saying like

1121
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:22,143
Well

1122
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:24,703
Is collusion bad like that

1123
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:28,799
Those are trial balloons

1124
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:30,847
Next clip

1125
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:36,479
Alex Jones a little bit of to about what the Russian narrative is

1126
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:39,551
Which is pretty fun

1127
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:40,319
He gets Tucson

1128
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:42,111
Harry does Sakura

1129
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:44,927
But then it gets

1130
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:46,463
Some scary news

1131
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:49,279
Staring

1132
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:50,047
You'll find out

1133
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:51,583
Tabitha Russian

1134
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:53,375
Hillary's in bad weather

1135
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:54,399
Company

1136
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:58,495
I know you are but what am I

1137
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:09,759
7 Ways to Sunday

1138
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:16,159
And George Soros

1139
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:21,535
Audi

1140
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:27,167
DoubleDown

1141
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:43,807
That's not what you're saying

1142
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:53,791
Kohl's

1143
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:05,567
You just hoped

1144
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:08,383
And say

1145
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:18,623
At the Federal Election Commission was no proof

1146
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:33,215
Brewskis

1147
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:36,799
I get it from our audience if everybody knows it

1148
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:41,151
So the issue there is that

1149
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:44,735
There have been some indications that Mueller's

1150
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:47,039
Investigation will have to do with

1151
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:55,231
Yeah absolutely

1152
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:55,999
7 fluidscape

1153
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:58,047
Has been

1154
00:54:58,303 --> 00:54:59,839
And a large portion of that is

1155
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:02,143
YouTube ivy

1156
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:03,935
Pro Trump alright

1157
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:04,959
Ding dong

1158
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:08,287
So there was an article a while back

1159
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:11,615
About that about wars and Drudge

1160
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:12,639
Breitbart

1161
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:15,199
May become part of the scope of the investigation

1162
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:15,967
Inasmuch

1163
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:16,991
As they

1164
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:18,015
Far

1165
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:19,551
Mirroring

1166
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:20,575
Russian talking

1167
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:22,623
Mirroring

1168
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:24,927
Disseminating Russian propaganda

1169
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:26,975
It seems relevant

1170
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:27,743
The investigation

1171
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:29,535
Now there was an article

1172
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:31,327
What came out the other day and washing

1173
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:32,351
Examiner

1174
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:33,887
Which is a dog

1175
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:39,519
They were talking about how she article from a couple months ago

1176
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:40,543
I didn't

1177
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:42,847
The FEC might be revisiting

1178
00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:45,663
Is Alex Jones taken that as medication

1179
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:47,967
He is under federal investigation

1180
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:51,551
Spinning it like that to make himself a Vic

1181
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:53,087
Read what the other

1182
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:53,855
Piece of it is

1183
00:55:54,879 --> 00:55:55,647
He's saying

1184
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:56,671
That

1185
00:55:56,927 --> 00:55:57,951
It's about them getting

1186
00:55:58,207 --> 00:55:58,975
Paid by the rush

1187
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:01,535
Cuz he knows that that isn't a charge that

1188
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:02,303
He can

1189
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:03,327
Beat

1190
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:06,143
So he's like oh they're saying that I'm getting money from the Russian

1191
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:13,055
I mean is it a charger

1192
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:20,735
I'd love to get a look at his finances don't get me wrong I'm willing to believe that he has a

1193
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:22,527
Received any direct

1194
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:23,807
Money from Russia

1195
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:24,831
Anything like that

1196
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:25,855
I think

1197
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:29,951
Varmour Vicki's beholden to

1198
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:31,231
Russian propaganda

1199
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:32,767
Give

1200
00:56:33,279 --> 00:56:34,815
Not necessarily

1201
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:35,583
Because

1202
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:36,607
He is

1203
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:38,911
Giving marching orders but

1204
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:39,935
Because of those

1205
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:40,959
Because of that

1206
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:42,239
He has

1207
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:43,007
To be getting

1208
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:43,775
Positive

1209
00:56:44,031 --> 00:56:44,543
Feedback

1210
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:45,567
Uncertain

1211
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:47,103
Thanks

1212
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:48,895
He's going to lean into that

1213
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:49,663
In order to get

1214
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:53,247
Right if you got bot Farms that are giving you a

1215
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:54,783
Huge boost

1216
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:56,575
Every time you repeat Russian

1217
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:57,343
Propaganda

1218
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:59,391
You don't necessarily know that's

1219
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:02,975
You're doing the same way

1220
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:06,303
Right now MSNBC is getting higher ratings

1221
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:07,583
Because they're going after

1222
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:13,215
Seth rich

1223
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:15,519
They're lying and making up bulshit

1224
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:17,055
Everybody's

1225
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:17,823
Canobie Lake

1226
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:19,615
Mickey Mouse

1227
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:23,711
Yeah now the other piece that we have to take into account is

1228
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:24,735
Prior

1229
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:26,527
And that's super important

1230
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:27,807
So

1231
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:31,391
I am unwilling to believe

1232
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:32,671
That this is

1233
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:33,695
The first time

1234
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:37,791
That Donald Trump Junior has been offered information

1235
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:38,815
From a Russian

1236
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:39,583
Source

1237
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:40,351
Or some

1238
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:41,887
Resource like that

1239
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:43,679
Okay

1240
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:47,007
I flatly refuse to believe that this is the only time that's ever happen

1241
00:57:47,775 --> 00:57:49,055
And if we go back

1242
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:50,079
Just a couple bucks

1243
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:51,871
On the Alex Jones Show

1244
00:57:52,127 --> 00:57:54,175
Alex Jones revealed on air

1245
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:55,455
But his source

1246
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:59,039
Mike cernovich has doors for inside information

1247
00:57:59,295 --> 00:58:00,063
Was Donald Trump

1248
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:02,367
So if that's the case

1249
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:04,415
He is being fed

1250
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:05,695
Straight pipeline

1251
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:07,487
Propaganda

1252
00:58:07,999 --> 00:58:09,535
Donald Trump jr. is getting

1253
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:10,559
From these Russians

1254
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:13,375
He's only like

1255
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:14,911
Two stages removed

1256
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:16,447
M-theory

1257
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:17,471
The direct

1258
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:19,263
Spigot of propaganda

1259
00:58:19,775 --> 00:58:20,799
And that's

1260
00:58:24,383 --> 00:58:25,919
Junior

1261
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:26,943
Giving it to them

1262
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:28,223
And then yeah

1263
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:30,271
There's a massive problem

1264
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:32,319
Agent

1265
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:33,855
Yeah they're only two steps

1266
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:34,623
Remove trim cap

1267
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:42,815
Slipping on Aaron saying that is

1268
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:44,095
Incredibly important

1269
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:45,119
Like that

1270
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:46,143
Bucked up

1271
00:58:58,687 --> 00:58:59,455
Down

1272
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:01,503
Nobody's getting charged with a crime because

1273
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:06,879
Because the only the only way to get these people charged

1274
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:09,695
Crime is FB FBI

1275
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:12,511
Are the FBI

1276
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:15,839
Listening

1277
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:17,375
Like they would have

1278
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:18,655
To take it upon themselves

1279
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:19,679
To arrest

1280
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:20,447
All of the

1281
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:22,751
And that is beyond

1282
00:59:23,007 --> 00:59:24,287
What I think they're capable of

1283
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:26,847
If the power is still

1284
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:28,895
Consolidated amongst

1285
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:31,455
The GOP who in the same way that

1286
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:34,271
Weather in Brazil

1287
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:35,295
Tamara was

1288
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:36,575
Caught on tape

1289
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:37,855
Offering bribes

1290
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:40,415
To get the corruption investigation

1291
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:42,463
To go away we just went to prison

1292
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:43,743
Notes

1293
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:46,047
Oh I'm sorry

1294
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:49,119
President-trump

1295
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:50,399
2002 to 2000

1296
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:54,751
He's the one who is installed by the Brazilian oligarch

1297
00:59:55,263 --> 00:59:56,031
After

1298
00:59:56,287 --> 00:59:56,799
Taking down

1299
00:59:59,103 --> 01:00:01,407
And so the only reason that Tamara still

1300
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:02,687
Is because

1301
01:00:02,943 --> 01:00:04,479
All of the people who run the government

1302
01:00:04,991 --> 01:00:05,759
Have a vested

1303
01:00:06,015 --> 01:00:06,527
Interested

1304
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:08,575
Because he's going to keep

1305
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:09,855
Keep them from going

1306
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:11,903
Great

1307
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:14,463
You know the GOP

1308
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:15,487
Get rid of

1309
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:16,511
Is because

1310
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:18,559
He's really the only one who's going to keep

1311
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:21,887
You keeping them go to jail in the same

1312
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:25,727
He is the reason that they would be going

1313
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:28,287
Complicit

1314
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:31,103
Right

1315
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:33,663
People want to say like

1316
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:35,455
Take over and he's going to be

1317
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:37,247
More evil and and

1318
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:38,783
But he's going to be a better States

1319
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:40,831
If Pence takes over

1320
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:42,879
He should go to jail too

1321
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:45,183
Leggett they're all

1322
01:00:47,231 --> 01:00:48,511
We need a Sunkist

1323
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:51,839
Strawberry soda style hard reboot on the government

1324
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:54,655
Quite frankly

1325
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:55,423
No probably not

1326
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:56,447
We're going to be in trouble

1327
01:00:56,703 --> 01:00:57,471
Oh yeah

1328
01:00:57,983 --> 01:00:58,495
I got a phone call

1329
01:00:59,007 --> 01:01:00,031
Lexus

1330
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:02,847
Good so

1331
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:05,663
It's good to switch from hopelessness to a fun little

1332
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:06,687
I would like

1333
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:11,807
To point out before this clip gets played that I believe that the mess

1334
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:13,343
Spying isn't it

1335
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:14,111
Bixby address

1336
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:15,647
It is a real thing

1337
01:01:15,903 --> 01:01:17,695
Absolutely

1338
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:20,255
Alex Jones podcast

1339
01:01:22,815 --> 01:01:28,959
Exposed as a fraud the Memoirs are destroying their ratings go from almost nothing to just

1340
01:01:29,215 --> 01:01:31,519
Almost

1341
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:32,287
Opposite

1342
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:36,639
Question

1343
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:40,223
Outside

1344
01:01:45,343 --> 01:01:47,647
Call the National Security Agency under Obama

1345
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:49,439
With a giant legal

1346
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:55,071
Thousands of people

1347
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:01,983
Pyles office when they left

1348
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:04,031
Just a snapshot

1349
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:06,079
I'm a few thousand public figures

1350
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:07,103

01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:08,895
Alex Jones Donald Trump

1352
01:02:09,151 --> 01:02:12,735
What do they all have in common

1353
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:22,463
Those are all numbers

1354
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:26,047
A phone number that I had a landline

1355
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:30,911
Number

1356
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:32,959
Alex Jones's office number

1357
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:35,263
My private

1358
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:36,287
Phone number

1359
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:40,127
6 years ago under Obama

1360
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:46,527
Turn on list

1361
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:50,879
They're listening because they know I'm exposing their Criminal

1362
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:57,279
Info

1363
01:02:58,303 --> 01:03:01,119
If you'd like to know why I am

1364
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:02,911
Dancing in the studio

1365
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:05,215
But listening to Alex Jones

1366
01:03:05,471 --> 01:03:09,311
Go back to the store episode about that information the game from jail

1367
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:12,127
Crock of s***

1368
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:13,663
All of that is

1369
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:16,479
That is so stupid

1370
01:03:16,735 --> 01:03:17,759
It looks like

1371
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:19,807
The emails came from Kush

1372
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:23,135
It looks like it is a internal setup

1373
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:24,927
That sort of situation

1374
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:33,119
Sheriff arpaio's Dennis Montgomery related Dragon isn't real

1375
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:39,519
It's based on an elaborate fraud that we got to the bottom of Google Search

1376
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:40,799
Eventually find

1377
01:03:43,103 --> 01:03:45,407
This is why I'm so bored

1378
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:46,687
Valex in the present

1379
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:47,967
He's getting so lazy

1380
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:51,039
Like there's just all these things that we've already looked into

1381
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:52,831
Can you brings in the Montgomery s***

1382
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:54,367
We're talk about for 3 hours

1383
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:59,999
But you haven't heard that episode bill doesn't do it I've never been prouder of myself

1384
01:04:00,255 --> 01:04:02,047
All this other stuff

1385
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:04,607
Anyone that app

1386
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:10,495
Yeah all this other stuff is like misinterpreting current stuff

1387
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:12,031
That's boring

1388
01:04:12,287 --> 01:04:13,055
5

1389
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:16,383
It just all these old tricks an old narratives repurpose

1390
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:17,919
I think

1391
01:04:18,175 --> 01:04:20,735
The larger problem is

1392
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:21,503
Lazy

1393
01:04:21,759 --> 01:04:22,527
It said he does

1394
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:25,343
If you don't have anything to go on

1395
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:27,647
Right there's no there's no other end

1396
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:28,415
So because

1397
01:04:29,183 --> 01:04:29,695
His wagon

1398
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:32,255
Before before he got on the Trump

1399
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:34,559
He's got

1400
01:04:34,815 --> 01:04:35,327
Everything

1401
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:36,863
Yeah

1402
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:38,399
He can talk about whatever you want

1403
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:40,447
But now that he's there

1404
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:41,983
He is under constant

1405
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:44,543
He is under constant

1406
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:47,359
To kind of pull this.

1407
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:49,919
He's always defending

1408
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:52,479
Damn

1409
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:54,527
Come from a place of

1410
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:56,063
I am fighting back

1411
01:04:56,575 --> 01:04:57,343
I'm always

1412
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:58,111
I'm always

1413
01:04:58,367 --> 01:05:00,927
Defensive

1414
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:01,695
There

1415
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:02,719
Where else

1416
01:05:02,975 --> 01:05:04,767
Do you go like what other narrative

1417
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:10,399
Non-religious everything's got to be related to got to do these like pedophiles

1418
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:14,751
Too but also

1419
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:16,031
Stupid

1420
01:05:17,055 --> 01:05:20,127
If I was if I was

1421
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:24,223
Just you know whatever you know what I realized I think I think I kind of got to pick

1422
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:25,759
Picture of what Alex Jones is

1423
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:26,527
Business

1424
01:05:26,783 --> 01:05:27,551
Model is

1425
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:30,367
Like nocturnes what his finances are I'm still very curious

1426
01:05:30,623 --> 01:05:31,391
About that

1427
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:36,255
If you go back to like the 2015 stuff that we're going over

1428
01:05:36,511 --> 01:05:37,279
I kind of notice of

1429
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:38,047
Pattern

1430
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:39,327
Of false

1431
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:41,119
Prediction that he knows are false

1432
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:43,423
Like the Purple Penguin stuff

1433
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:46,751
He's saying that there's this

1434
01:05:47,007 --> 01:05:47,519
Gay rights

1435
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:52,639
Organization that is trying to outlaw the use of the words boy and girl mother and father

1436
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:54,175
That's what he says

1437
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:57,759
He knows that that's never going to happen and that's not what people are asking for

1438
01:05:58,015 --> 01:06:00,831
But he knows that his audience is dumb and it keeps

1439
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:03,647
Quicksand their mind they're tall Purple Penguin

1440
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:05,951
Yeah these f****** dumb liberals around it

1441
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:07,743
So when it doesn't happen

1442
01:06:07,999 --> 01:06:10,815
Use of boy and girl is still legal

1443
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:12,863
He gets to be like I did that

1444
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:14,911
Because we brought awareness to it

1445
01:06:15,167 --> 01:06:15,679
I did

1446
01:06:16,703 --> 01:06:19,775
The it's just I attached

1447
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:24,127
You can't because it's setup

1448
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:25,663
It's all set up

1449
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:28,479
When he starts doing the narrative he knows

1450
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:29,503
How it's going to

1451
01:06:30,271 --> 01:06:31,039
And I think

1452
01:06:31,295 --> 01:06:33,087
In the case of like the

1453
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:35,647
Them saying that I'm being federally investigated

1454
01:06:35,903 --> 01:06:37,183
Another one of those

1455
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:40,255
He knows he's not actually being investigated for

1456
01:06:41,535 --> 01:06:46,143
Getting money from Russia

1457
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:47,679
Or whatever

1458
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:54,079
He can claim a victory for a false battle that he could have and I think on some level

1459
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:56,639
Maybe a big score in his mind

1460
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:59,967
Like obviously I don't think he thought he was going to win

1461
01:07:00,735 --> 01:07:02,527
I think that it was a lie

1462
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:04,319
Trump can win

1463
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:07,135
The globalists are going to not let him win

1464
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:09,695
That that was the narrative

1465
01:07:09,951 --> 01:07:11,231
Then he sets up an advance

1466
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:13,535
This would be like

1467
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:17,119
If people really did Outlaw door

1468
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:18,143
Boy and girl

1469
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:19,679
Like what would you do at that

1470
01:07:20,191 --> 01:07:21,215
That's a good question

1471
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:27,871
Did Trump getting elected is like one of his failed marriages actually coming through

1472
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:28,895
World of his own design

1473
01:07:31,455 --> 01:07:34,527
Very unpleasant

1474
01:07:34,783 --> 01:07:37,855
Yeah so long as so long as he fights imaginary battles

1475
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:38,879
He always wins

1476
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:39,903
Bedtime

1477
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:41,951
Caught in a real fight

1478
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:43,999
He does not know how to do that

1479
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:46,047
No.

1480
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:47,071
I don't actually

1481
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:50,911
Thank you.

1482
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:53,471
Charlie Brown

1483
01:07:55,007 --> 01:07:56,287
Is a cake by metaphorical win

1484
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:57,311
2 b

1485
01:07:57,567 --> 01:07:58,079
Just pretend

1486
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:00,639
Threat

1487
01:08:00,895 --> 01:08:04,223
I'm serious about Alex I don't have clips of it but

1488
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:07,039
Show earlier this week I think I was on Monday

1489
01:08:07,807 --> 01:08:08,831
He

1490
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:12,671
Keeps talking about

1491
01:08:12,927 --> 01:08:14,719
Monty Python and the Holy Grail

1492
01:08:15,487 --> 01:08:18,559
And he's the Knight who gets his limbs

1493
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:26,495
You said Monty Python

1494
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:29,567
Entire movies

1495
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:30,847
I know every lie

1496
01:08:31,103 --> 01:08:32,639
He calls that night

1497
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:34,175
A knight who says me

1498
01:08:35,455 --> 01:08:37,247
Absolutely absolutely

1499
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:43,391
I refuse to accept that

1500
01:08:43,647 --> 01:08:47,231
Like to say me want a Shrubbery and then he gets his leg cut off

1501
01:08:47,487 --> 01:08:49,023
How dare you

1502
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:55,423
Are you out in 15 years

1503
01:08:55,679 --> 01:09:00,031
With your transphobia

1504
01:09:00,543 --> 01:09:03,871
Nigel farage

1505
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:06,687
The movie again

1506
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:14,367
Can't watch that movie

1507
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:15,903
Very anti apologize

1508
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:19,999
What is pro Joseph Watson

1509
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:20,767
Is white Nash

1510
01:09:22,303 --> 01:09:22,815
This next

1511
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:23,583
Clip

1512
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:28,191
Alex Jones wants to

1513
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:28,959
To tell you

1514
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:31,007
You

1515
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:33,055
You want to tell you why Trump

1516
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:34,591
What is B is the villain

1517
01:09:34,847 --> 01:09:35,359
In the globalist

1518
01:09:35,615 --> 01:09:36,127
Paradigm

1519
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:41,247
He's coming up

1520
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:46,623
I want to play

1521
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:54,047
Overthrow the West

1522
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:55,583
You'll never defeat us

1523
01:10:11,711 --> 01:10:17,855
Liberal globalist

1524
01:10:18,111 --> 01:10:18,879
My family

1525
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:20,927
So

1526
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:23,231
Discussed a little bit

1527
01:10:23,487 --> 01:10:23,999
Speech

1528
01:10:27,071 --> 01:10:29,119
Text

1529
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:31,423
There's a lot of people who think it's just

1530
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:35,519
You know Freedom isn't talked about freedom

1531
01:10:37,311 --> 01:10:40,639
So you guys don't have to do it is

1532
01:10:40,895 --> 01:10:42,431
Went checked out storm

1533
01:10:42,687 --> 01:10:44,991
Confront

1534
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:50,879
I wanted to see what

1535
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:51,647
The speech was

1536
01:10:54,975 --> 01:10:55,487
Got them at

1537
01:10:56,767 --> 01:10:58,815
They understood the coded language

1538
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:02,655
Look at all the white people in the crowd just decades ago America

1539
01:11:02,911 --> 01:11:04,959
In crowds used to look like that to Holy

1540
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:08,287
F*** this about all white Poland

1541
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:12,639
To see him there with all these white people

1542
01:11:15,711 --> 01:11:16,991
Notice how a pro White

1543
01:11:17,247 --> 01:11:21,343
Speech in a pro-white country Poland

1544
01:11:21,599 --> 01:11:25,183
Is completely ignored by the Jew media and anti Trump Jews

1545
01:11:26,975 --> 01:11:27,743
Cool cool cool

1546
01:11:27,999 --> 01:11:28,511
Cool cool cool

1547
01:11:30,559 --> 01:11:36,703
Such a Sublime speech given by Trump and Poland only to have the carefully-planned leaks on Donald Trump

1548
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:39,263
Junior to take some of the Shine off his momentous occasion

1549
01:11:39,519 --> 01:11:43,615
Also perfectly time by the Auntie white forces around Trump

1550
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:47,711
Now we are more determined to stand and fight against these venal solace

1551
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:48,479
Destructive Elam

1552
01:11:48,991 --> 01:11:50,015
Makeup the anti-white

1553
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:51,039
And Auntie West

1554
01:11:51,295 --> 01:11:51,807
Coalition

1555
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:53,087
At least they used

1556
01:11:55,391 --> 01:11:59,231
2 hours I misspelled something else then

1557
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:02,815
He mentioned quote our way of life

1558
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:05,119
And I said you see what's out there

1559
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:06,399
Trump knows what's up

1560
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:10,495
I mean the post about it are all pretty much

1561
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:11,775
Spaghetti

1562
01:12:13,823 --> 01:12:14,335
I don't

1563
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:17,919
I don't believe it's possible that Alex Jones

1564
01:12:18,175 --> 01:12:19,711
For all of his studies

1565
01:12:20,223 --> 01:12:20,735
Is Dawning

1566
01:12:20,991 --> 01:12:21,759
Everything

1567
01:12:22,015 --> 01:12:25,087
So smart and so are has no idea how people

1568
01:12:25,599 --> 01:12:27,135
I can't imagine that

1569
01:12:27,391 --> 01:12:27,903
He's oblivious

1570
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:28,671
Two white mask

1571
01:12:31,999 --> 01:12:33,535
Everything but name

1572
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:36,095
People

1573
01:12:36,351 --> 01:12:37,631
The people that he's surrounded

1574
01:12:37,887 --> 01:12:38,399
Himself with

1575
01:12:38,655 --> 01:12:39,935
Even if Trump doesn't

1576
01:12:40,191 --> 01:12:40,703
No

1577
01:12:40,959 --> 01:12:44,287
She has no idea because maybe does

1578
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:46,079
Maybe he doesn't understand the dog with

1579
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:48,383
I mean

1580
01:12:48,639 --> 01:12:49,919
Maybe

1581
01:12:50,175 --> 01:12:50,943
Understand

1582
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:55,039
Like he agrees with it but it doesn't really

1583
01:12:56,063 --> 01:12:57,087
What makes it a jaguar

1584
01:12:57,343 --> 01:13:00,927
Possible

1585
01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:02,463
You can talk to your parents and they'll be like

1586
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:03,487
No he's just

1587
01:13:04,511 --> 01:13:05,791
It's the right

1588
01:13:06,047 --> 01:13:06,815
Understand it

1589
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:08,607
But the white nationalist

1590
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:10,143
Immediately

1591
01:13:10,655 --> 01:13:12,703
All of the codes and this

1592
01:13:12,959 --> 01:13:13,727
Is 100

1593
01:13:13,983 --> 01:13:14,751
Percent why

1594
01:13:15,775 --> 01:13:16,543
We go back

1595
01:13:16,799 --> 01:13:18,847
And listen to that David interview that out

1596
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:19,615
Alex Jones dead

1597
01:13:20,127 --> 01:13:23,199
David Duke doesn't really get why Alex Jones isn't on board with

1598
01:13:23,455 --> 01:13:25,503
Reason to callers

1599
01:13:25,759 --> 01:13:26,783
The call him don't understand

1600
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:31,647
Hey what's going on everybody

1601
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:32,927
To the word listen

1602
01:13:33,183 --> 01:13:34,207
To what's being said

1603
01:13:34,463 --> 01:13:40,607
Knows that Alex Jones is absolutely is in the way he presented stories and all of his

1604
01:13:40,863 --> 01:13:41,375
Is rhetoric

1605
01:13:41,631 --> 01:13:42,143
All of it

1606
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:43,935
And the idea that he's been

1607
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:45,471
Accused of being this thing

1608
01:13:45,727 --> 01:13:48,031
I don't believe he'd never look into it

1609
01:13:48,287 --> 01:13:50,079
I don't believe that he never liked

1610
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:51,615
Check out what they're all about

1611
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:52,639
Alex

1612
01:13:57,503 --> 01:14:01,599
Does he read any of the s*** that like if he doesn't resemble that

1613
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:02,367
Put

1614
01:14:02,879 --> 01:14:04,159
He probably Ron White nationalism

1615
01:14:04,415 --> 01:14:05,439
Message Board headline

1616
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:10,815
Attitude like Trump gives great speech alright

1617
01:14:11,327 --> 01:14:12,863
Position

1618
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:15,423
That's pretty pretty strongly felt

1619
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:16,447
But Alex Jones

1620
01:14:16,703 --> 01:14:19,263
Is at least

1621
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:21,567
And is

1622
01:14:22,847 --> 01:14:24,127
Subconsciously or conscious

1623
01:14:24,383 --> 01:14:25,919
Mostly supportive of

1624
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:29,759
Yeah now he has a really funny

1625
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:31,551
Quip here

1626
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:32,319
We're here

1627
01:14:32,575 --> 01:14:36,415
You imagine what a historical leader of the past might have thought about him

1628
01:14:37,183 --> 01:14:38,719
Which one

1629
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:40,511
Establishment

1630
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:45,119
Now

1631
01:14:59,711 --> 01:15:01,503
It's wonderful.

1632
01:15:02,271 --> 01:15:07,391
44 if I was alive

1633
01:15:07,647 --> 01:15:09,695
Launch

1634
01:15:14,815 --> 01:15:18,143
I don't think that Hitler would not like Alex

1635
01:15:18,399 --> 01:15:24,543
Is awesome

1636
01:15:24,799 --> 01:15:30,943
Hitler's belief

1637
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:31,711
Would be

1638
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:32,735
Best friend

1639
01:15:33,759 --> 01:15:36,063
Actually looks

1640
01:15:43,743 --> 01:15:44,767
If those guys

1641
01:15:45,023 --> 01:15:46,815
Would Have Been Loved by Hitler

1642
01:15:47,071 --> 01:15:48,351
Who always say that

1643
01:15:48,607 --> 01:15:49,887
Martin Luther King jr.

1644
01:15:50,655 --> 01:15:53,983
Yeah those guys are like

1645
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:57,055
This week Alex Jones just

1646
01:15:57,311 --> 01:15:59,615
Heard about that NRA video The Dana Loesch

1647
01:15:59,871 --> 01:16:02,175
Threatened

1648
01:16:02,431 --> 01:16:03,967
And it was like

1649
01:16:04,735 --> 01:16:05,503
Liberal

1650
01:16:05,759 --> 01:16:09,343
Guns at all

1651
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:10,367
She just says

1652
01:16:10,623 --> 01:16:12,927
I hate these Liberals are

1653
01:16:13,183 --> 01:16:14,207
To kill our president

1654
01:16:14,463 --> 01:16:19,071
Are children

1655
01:16:19,327 --> 01:16:21,119
Closed fist of Truth

1656
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:23,423
Now here's why that's a brilliant

1657
01:16:23,935 --> 01:16:25,727
Cuz it doesn't mention guns

1658
01:16:25,983 --> 01:16:27,775
Liberals

1659
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:30,079
Afraid

1660
01:16:30,591 --> 01:16:31,359
Hey they might buy some

1661
01:16:32,127 --> 01:16:38,271
That's not a bad

1662
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:39,807
That's a genius angle

1663
01:16:40,063 --> 01:16:41,087
Cuz you're playing both sides

1664
01:16:42,623 --> 01:16:44,415
Hey they're trying to kill our president

1665
01:16:44,671 --> 01:16:46,207
You should buy guns

1666
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:47,487
Yourself and him

1667
01:16:47,743 --> 01:16:49,535
Liberals are like

1668
01:16:50,047 --> 01:16:51,327
You guys are going to burn

1669
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:56,191
It does feel that way

1670
01:16:56,703 --> 01:17:02,847
I mean it's like 2 weeks old at this point

1671
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:04,127
Skewed

1672
01:17:04,383 --> 01:17:04,895
Rock

1673
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:06,687
Rock hard boner

1674
01:17:06,943 --> 01:17:08,735
Until he decided to make his own verse

1675
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:12,319
Oh no no no

1676
01:17:13,343 --> 01:17:16,927
But it's not about the NRA

1677
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:17,951
It's about

1678
01:17:20,255 --> 01:17:26,399
No it's Alex basically just realized like a promo a wrestling style promo

1679
01:17:26,655 --> 01:17:29,983
Excellent

1680
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:35,871
But it doesn't

1681
01:17:36,895 --> 01:17:40,735
So close all my on the tales of the NRA video

1682
01:17:41,247 --> 01:17:43,295
I've kept it in its entirety

1683

Diana it

1684
01:17:46,367 --> 01:17:47,647

The final equation

1694
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:19,391
Why the left hates America

1695
01:18:19,903 --> 01:18:20,927
Hitler would have loved to

1696
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:24,767
Rising anti-American rhetoric

1697
01:18:25,023 --> 01:18:25,535
And what

1698
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:26,815
Behind it

1699

Hollywood

1704
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:15,711
Our education system

1705
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:41,311
Electric razor

1706
01:20:13,567 --> 01:20:19,712
Burning cars

1707
01:20:19,968 --> 01:20:23,296
All of this leads to the destabilization

1708
01:20:29,952 --> 01:20:35,840
America America we are the infowar

1709
01:20:36,096 --> 01:20:37,120
And we are

1710
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:39,936
Like crazy

1711
01:20:41,728 --> 01:20:42,240
Because

1712
01:20:43,264 --> 01:20:43,776
Isn't

1713
01:20:45,056 --> 01:20:45,824
That's what

1714
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:47,616
That's what that video said

1715
01:20:47,872 --> 01:20:49,152
What

1716
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:51,712
What do you mean

1717
01:20:51,968 --> 01:20:53,504
Okay walk me through your friend

1718
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:56,064
Was calling for

1719
01:21:00,928 --> 01:21:01,696
That could not be

1720
01:21:01,952 --> 01:21:04,512
Misconstrued as not being called for violin

1721
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:09,376
On the left there's no

1722
01:21:09,632 --> 01:21:13,728
Now if it's that was not made by the NRA

1723
01:21:16,544 --> 01:21:18,592
Conservative organization

1724
01:21:18,848 --> 01:21:19,360
For literacy

1725
01:21:20,128 --> 01:21:21,152
Or something like that

1726
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:24,480
Organization that would never

1727
01:21:24,736 --> 01:21:26,016
Hibachi

1728
01:21:26,272 --> 01:21:27,040
Waterbirth

1729
01:21:27,296 --> 01:21:28,832
You know cuz it's not a gun

1730
01:21:29,088 --> 01:21:31,904
It's not

1731
01:21:32,672 --> 01:21:36,512
Yeah but yeah it's pretty difficult

1732
01:21:37,536 --> 01:21:38,048
Things short of calling

1733
01:21:38,304 --> 01:21:40,352
I believe that Alex Jones

1734
01:21:43,168 --> 01:21:44,448
Couching

1735
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:45,728
Hey

1736
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:47,776
You're going to have to retaliate

1737
01:21:48,032 --> 01:21:48,800
Exactly

1738
01:21:49,056 --> 01:21:52,128
You're going to have to be a good guy with the gun you're going to have to save this

1739
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:53,664
From

1740
01:21:54,176 --> 01:21:54,688
Nan wife

1741
01:21:55,712 --> 01:21:57,248
It's always 8

1742
01:21:59,296 --> 01:22:02,368
I don't don't understand how we live in

1743
01:22:02,624 --> 01:22:03,648
Different reality

1744
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:05,440
Like there is nobody

1745
01:22:05,952 --> 01:22:07,488
Calling to assassinate

1746
01:22:07,744 --> 01:22:10,560
Except for Alex.

1747
01:22:10,816 --> 01:22:13,632
And god dammit if I'm not the person who would

1748
01:22:15,168 --> 01:22:21,312
Accurately pretty much the only person in mass media

1749
01:22:22,336 --> 01:22:22,848
Discussing

1750
01:22:23,104 --> 01:22:24,128
Regularly

1751
01:22:24,384 --> 01:22:26,432
And he's you calling for it

1752
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:27,200
Inasmuch as

1753
01:22:27,456 --> 01:22:28,736
Is he saying that everyone else is calling

1754
01:22:28,992 --> 01:22:29,504
Right

1755
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:32,320
He's trying to do some sort of the meter

1756
01:22:32,576 --> 01:22:35,392
Can you imagine how happy

1757
01:22:36,672 --> 01:22:39,744
Would be thrilled

1758
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,280
In so many different ways

1759
01:22:41,536 --> 01:22:43,328
Yep that would make him

1760
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:46,144
Hero be a prophet

1761
01:22:46,656 --> 01:22:48,960
But I mean still just with his old white bass

1762
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:50,752
Matter

1763
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:54,592
And the mainstream Burdick Hunter

1764
01:22:54,848 --> 01:22:57,664
Something totally you could take

1765
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:04,064
Pence would become president and he doesn't like Pence all that much so he'd have a new enemy in power

1766
01:23:07,904 --> 01:23:08,416
You can't

1767
01:23:08,672 --> 01:23:09,440
You can't do that

1768
01:23:14,048 --> 01:23:16,608
It's boring it's boring when you're villain

1769
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:17,632
It's

1770
01:23:18,144 --> 01:23:20,448
It's your villain can't actually do any

1771
01:23:20,704 --> 01:23:25,312
Yeah villain was just kind of like a little baby

1772
01:23:25,568 --> 01:23:26,848
Torpor

1773
01:23:28,384 --> 01:23:29,664
Core James Bond villain

1774
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:30,944
Who's in a wheelchair

1775
01:23:31,712 --> 01:23:33,504
The boy

1776
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:36,320
Sidetrack

1777
01:23:36,576 --> 01:23:37,088
Okay

1778
01:23:39,392 --> 01:23:39,904
There's a lot going on

1779
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:42,208
Right but Alex Jones

1780
01:23:44,256 --> 01:23:45,536
Is so bad at his job

1781
01:23:46,816 --> 01:23:48,096
He can't cover all this

1782
01:23:48,352 --> 01:23:50,144
Who decides to take a nice five minute

1783
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:51,168
It's out of his show

1784
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:52,704
Mark Dice

1785
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:53,472
Video

1786
01:23:54,496 --> 01:24:00,384
Guy we played a number of Mark Dice videos where he goes out on the street and ask people questions and

1787
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:01,664
Spotrac

1788
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:02,432
Threat

1789
01:24:02,688 --> 01:24:03,968
In this clip

1790
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:06,784
This is the other version of Mark Dice video

1791
01:24:07,552 --> 01:24:09,088
Or he does cultural common

1792
01:24:11,392 --> 01:24:13,696
And I want to keep this an entirely

1793
01:24:14,208 --> 01:24:14,976
It's very

1794
01:24:15,232 --> 01:24:15,744
Bad

1795
01:24:16,768 --> 01:24:17,280
Dumb

1796
01:24:17,536 --> 01:24:20,352
But I want it I want to illustrate a couple

1797
01:24:20,864 --> 01:24:21,888
Verse that Mark Tyson

1798
01:24:22,656 --> 01:24:23,680
I'm second

1799
01:24:23,936 --> 01:24:24,960
But on this day

1800
01:24:26,496 --> 01:24:27,264
We're post

1801
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:31,616
Donald Trump Jr revealing these emails that basically spell out of

1802
01:24:31,872 --> 01:24:32,640
Conspiracy

1803
01:24:32,896 --> 01:24:33,664
Alex Jones

1804
01:24:34,432 --> 01:24:35,968
This much time out of his f******

1805
01:24:36,224 --> 01:24:36,736
King show

1806
01:24:36,992 --> 01:24:37,504
To play this

1807
01:24:38,016 --> 01:24:39,296
What before we do that

1808
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:40,576
There is one

1809
01:24:40,832 --> 01:24:41,600
I'm saying that

1810
01:24:41,856 --> 01:24:43,648
One thing about that video

1811
01:24:45,952 --> 01:24:46,464
Proof

1812
01:24:46,976 --> 01:24:49,024
That nobody else at in Fort Worth

1813
01:24:50,048 --> 01:24:52,096
Like his voice over in that video

1814
01:24:52,352 --> 01:24:52,864
Is good

1815
01:24:55,168 --> 01:24:56,960
I think I took that out

1816
01:24:57,216 --> 01:24:58,496
1

1817
01:24:59,776 --> 01:25:00,544
Alex Jones

1818
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:04,128
Is like Sinatra

1819
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:06,944
But it's it

1820
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:08,224
Uses great Dynamics

1821
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:08,992
He uses dip

1822
01:25:09,248 --> 01:25:12,832
Adult video

1823
01:25:13,088 --> 01:25:14,112
Even though

1824
01:25:14,368 --> 01:25:15,648
None of his people could do the

1825
01:25:16,416 --> 01:25:19,744
Like all the times that we've heard voice-over especially from

1826
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:20,768
Paul Joseph Watson

1827
01:25:24,352 --> 01:25:27,936
That's pretty bad

1828
01:25:28,192 --> 01:25:29,728
Alex

1829
01:25:29,984 --> 01:25:32,544
Call Joseph

1830
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:35,872
Sam is also a pretty talented propagandist

1831
01:25:36,128 --> 01:25:37,664
In terms of the way he makes his videos

1832
01:25:40,736 --> 01:25:41,248
Any of those

1833
01:25:43,808 --> 01:25:46,368
But also it's just like

1834
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:48,160
You're just fast

1835
01:25:48,416 --> 01:25:49,184
Cutting lies

1836
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:52,000
It just fast-cut video lies and am looking like

1837
01:25:52,256 --> 01:25:52,768
He's going to cry

1838
01:25:53,024 --> 01:25:54,048
But be that as it may

1839
01:25:58,144 --> 01:26:00,448
I did decide if we ever get to it

1840
01:26:01,728 --> 01:26:02,752
Defense

1841
01:26:03,264 --> 01:26:03,776
Is it going to be

1842
01:26:04,288 --> 01:26:07,104
Go go eat a book please leave me alone

1843
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:08,896
Maybe Daniel f****** learns

1844
01:26:09,408 --> 01:26:12,992
Absolutely

1845
01:26:13,504 --> 01:26:14,784
So here is one of the least

1846
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:17,600
Talented members of the Infowars family

1847
01:26:17,856 --> 01:26:18,368
Mark Dice

1848
01:26:22,208 --> 01:26:24,256
And so much more

1849
01:26:24,512 --> 01:26:26,048
Also Captain Bahama care

1850
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:27,584
Shopping with tax.

1851
01:26:28,096 --> 01:26:30,400
That's all coming up Adam always guess we have a day

1852
01:26:30,656 --> 01:26:31,936
Titus report

1853
01:26:32,704 --> 01:26:38,848
Watching Amy Schumer is sexist or show has one star last on Netflix I take away the Star Ray

1854
01:26:42,688 --> 01:26:44,992
Amazon everywhere you rejected

1855
01:26:48,064 --> 01:26:51,392
Hollywood

1856
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:08,288
So get the video to second but I want it I want it

1857
01:27:08,544 --> 01:27:09,312
Point out a couple things

1858
01:27:09,568 --> 01:27:10,080
First

1859
01:27:12,384 --> 01:27:14,944
Now is the time

1860
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:15,968
The capital of

1861
01:27:18,016 --> 01:27:19,296
The big important stuff

1862
01:27:22,624 --> 01:27:27,488
I don't know

1863
01:27:29,024 --> 01:27:30,048
Is finally just like

1864
01:27:30,816 --> 01:27:31,328
You know what

1865
01:27:32,352 --> 01:27:32,864
I got to get this

1866
01:27:33,376 --> 01:27:36,704
Yeah I don't care what what's going on

1867
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:41,312
It's because no one else is

1868
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:43,104
A couple things that are

1869
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:44,896
Centerpoint out

1870
01:27:45,152 --> 01:27:47,968
She's going to mock the idea of sexist

1871
01:27:48,224 --> 01:27:48,736
Mnb

1872
01:27:49,248 --> 01:27:50,528
Misogynist

1873
01:27:51,552 --> 01:27:54,624
Beyond that I need to save us very clearly

1874
01:27:55,392 --> 01:27:57,952
The reason that she has a one-star rating

1875
01:27:58,208 --> 01:27:58,720
On

1876
01:27:58,976 --> 01:27:59,488
Netflix

1877
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,024
Is because of

1878
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:01,792
Brigading

1879
01:28:02,304 --> 01:28:03,584
It's because of the

1880
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:05,376
Men's rights

1881
01:28:05,632 --> 01:28:07,936
These alt-right dudes ago and just

1882
01:28:08,192 --> 01:28:08,704
In math

1883
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:14,080
It wants our reviews online reviews that are under attack like this like the Ghostbusters

1884
01:28:16,384 --> 01:28:17,152
If it's not

1885
01:28:17,664 --> 01:28:22,016
It's the starting point music I've got one star it's terrible that you know

1886
01:28:22,272 --> 01:28:26,880
God damn well why it has one start now

1887
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:29,952
I don't think

1888
01:28:30,208 --> 01:28:33,792
It's not for me to say that cuz I'm coming at it from a position of

1889
01:28:34,304 --> 01:28:34,816
I think

1890
01:28:35,072 --> 01:28:37,120
Summer premises or a little stale

1891
01:28:37,376 --> 01:28:39,168
Someone is really funny

1892
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:43,520
But I know I have other comedians like Maria Bamford I much rather watch

1893
01:28:45,824 --> 01:28:47,360
The position that they're coming from

1894
01:28:47,616 --> 01:28:48,128
Is

1895
01:28:48,384 --> 01:28:49,664
Regrettably sex

1896
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:50,688
Yeah

1897
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:52,224
Here's the Dice Man

1898
01:28:55,808 --> 01:28:56,320
Silverman

1899
01:28:58,624 --> 01:28:59,136
Christian

1900
01:28:59,392 --> 01:29:02,976
Tumi in Chicago

1901
01:29:03,232 --> 01:29:07,072
Absolute

1902
01:29:10,656 --> 01:29:14,496
People who are funnier than Mark Dice who are also named

1903
01:29:15,264 --> 01:29:18,080
Andrew Dice Clay

1904
01:29:18,336 --> 01:29:22,944
Endless play son throwing ironic

1905
01:29:23,456 --> 01:29:24,224
I like.

1906
01:29:26,016 --> 01:29:27,040
Okay

1907
01:30:09,024 --> 01:30:10,816
I'm sorry I want to take a break here real quick

1908
01:30:11,072 --> 01:30:12,864
To let everyone know that this

1909
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:14,656
Article

1910
01:30:14,912 --> 01:30:16,448
I was posted on April 5th

1911
01:30:16,704 --> 01:30:17,216
Of this year

1912
01:30:17,472 --> 01:30:20,032
A little old

1913
01:30:21,056 --> 01:30:23,360
Statute of limitations has run out

1914
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:43,840
Hilarious sketches

1915
01:30:49,728 --> 01:30:51,264
He said

1916
01:31:02,272 --> 01:31:06,624
I know exactly the argument that it's trying to make

1917
01:31:07,648 --> 01:31:10,208
And that is that people say to vulgar as a

1918
01:31:11,232 --> 01:31:16,352
Does a bit Louis c.k.

1919
01:31:16,608 --> 01:31:19,680
Type of archetype

1920
01:31:19,936 --> 01:31:20,704
Want to get to the

1921
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:22,752
The point of what this person's exercise

1922
01:31:23,264 --> 01:31:24,800
Just wants to read the article in the snarky

1923
01:31:25,056 --> 01:31:28,128
Voice

1924
01:32:03,456 --> 01:32:09,600
We love your

1925
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:18,560
So if Mark has wanted to make a compelling argument based on this very short

1926
01:32:18,816 --> 01:32:19,840
Censored clip

1927
01:32:20,864 --> 01:32:22,400
That's not a fair representation of her work

1928
01:32:22,656 --> 01:32:23,680
Weebly.com

1929
01:32:26,752 --> 01:32:29,824
Does the Brian Posehn joke for like 15 years ago

1930
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:33,920
It's told from the other perspectives and maybe it's a little bit different but the premise

1931
01:32:34,176 --> 01:32:34,944
Of women

1932
01:32:36,736 --> 01:32:38,528
Is a b

1933
01:32:38,784 --> 01:32:41,600
Been done that would be like

1934
01:32:43,136 --> 01:32:44,416
You actually know what you're talkin about

1935
01:32:44,928 --> 01:32:46,208
But see if that's the approach

1936
01:33:34,592 --> 01:33:36,384
Terrorist

1937
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:42,784
Equal pay

1938
01:34:00,704 --> 01:34:03,008
If you say the name Hillary Clinton

1939
01:34:16,832 --> 01:34:19,392
Email

1940
01:34:19,648 --> 01:34:20,416
If you go

1941
01:34:37,568 --> 01:34:43,712
Amy Schumer stand-up

1942
01:34:51,392 --> 01:34:51,904
These the worst

1943
01:34:52,416 --> 01:34:54,464
So I mean in this video

1944
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:55,744
Sound like

1945
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:57,024
He's laughing at everything

1946
01:34:57,280 --> 01:34:58,048
Sing but

1947
01:34:58,816 --> 01:34:59,840
It comes off as

1948
01:35:00,352 --> 01:35:01,376
As like weird and gross

1949
01:35:02,656 --> 01:35:08,032
It's crazy that is not not okay

1950
01:35:08,288 --> 01:35:12,128
It's not okay it's so many of the attacks that he tries

1951
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:14,432
Make on her our appearance

1952
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:17,760
Yeah they called her like Amy Shamu

1953
01:35:18,016 --> 01:35:19,808
Call Jerrod Niemann Pig

1954
01:35:22,624 --> 01:35:23,648
Thinking about her having sex

1955
01:35:23,904 --> 01:35:27,744
Yeah

1956
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:29,536
He's illustrating the

1957
01:35:29,792 --> 01:35:30,816
Very sexist

1958
01:35:31,072 --> 01:35:32,352
Position on Amy Schumer

1959
01:35:32,608 --> 01:35:33,888
While trying to mock

1960
01:35:34,144 --> 01:35:35,936
An article pointing that out

1961
01:35:36,192 --> 01:35:38,496
These people are so f****** stupid

1962
01:35:39,008 --> 01:35:39,520
But it works

1963
01:35:40,288 --> 01:35:41,312
Work

1964
01:35:41,824 --> 01:35:43,360
Amazing you don't want to be

1965
01:35:43,616 --> 01:35:45,408
You don't want to be the villain

1966
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:46,688
No matter

1967
01:35:48,736 --> 01:35:54,880
Like that maybe I think Rodger stone is fine

1968
01:35:55,136 --> 01:36:00,256
I love it I love it

1969
01:36:03,328 --> 01:36:08,192
Cheap razors

1970
01:36:08,448 --> 01:36:10,240
Before we move on from Mark Dice let me save it

1971
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:12,544
You should really stick

1972
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:14,592
To just asking drunk people stuff on it

1973
01:36:15,616 --> 01:36:18,176
This is because that is so much better than this

1974
01:36:18,688 --> 01:36:20,224
Like this work is terrible

1975
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:22,528
It's really sad because he does

1976
01:36:23,552 --> 01:36:28,928
Like there are

1977
01:36:29,184 --> 01:36:31,488
And not just that as far as the sexism

1978
01:36:32,256 --> 01:36:36,352
Like if you are if you aren't unlike and the reason that

1979
01:36:36,608 --> 01:36:37,120
In the Arctic

1980
01:36:39,424 --> 01:36:40,192
Is because

1981
01:36:40,448 --> 01:36:41,216
That coded

1982
01:36:41,728 --> 01:36:43,008
She's too vulgar

1983
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:45,312
Right it's not because

1984
01:36:45,824 --> 01:36:46,592
They didn't like

1985
01:36:47,616 --> 01:36:48,640
No

1986
01:36:48,896 --> 01:36:54,272
Up your favorite Lee office game with women taking that sort of an aggressive

1987
01:36:54,528 --> 01:36:55,040
Disposition

1988
01:36:57,088 --> 01:36:57,856
And listen

1989
01:36:58,368 --> 01:36:59,136
I don't let him get on

1990
01:36:59,904 --> 01:37:01,184
Trouble

1991
01:37:02,464 --> 01:37:04,000
Got to move on

1992
01:37:04,512 --> 01:37:05,024
Boy

1993
01:37:05,536 --> 01:37:07,072
I don't know if that's better

1994
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:11,936
Let's work for me.

1995
01:37:12,192 --> 01:37:18,336
Everything Rosie the Riveter will be down with that so let's move to the next clip or Alex that talked more about how

1996
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:21,408
He was just trying to get Russia

1997
01:37:22,944 --> 01:37:24,224
Suffuse he's back on that b*******

1998
01:37:27,296 --> 01:37:29,088
Espionage missing children

1999
01:37:32,416 --> 01:37:33,952
Call 911

2000
01:37:36,512 --> 01:37:37,280
Call 411

2001
01:37:37,792 --> 01:37:39,840
It isn't them trying to get there

2002
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:56,480
She didn't

2003
01:37:56,736 --> 01:38:02,624
Actually Alex you went to Russia debates Fox News

2004
01:38:04,928 --> 01:38:06,976
Infowars.com

2005
01:38:07,232 --> 01:38:08,256
Infowar

2006
01:38:10,304 --> 01:38:11,328
Outsiders

2007
01:38:17,728 --> 01:38:20,032
Just bring this up cuz you said over the video that Alex

2008
01:38:20,288 --> 01:38:21,056
Went to Russia

2009
01:38:24,896 --> 01:38:26,432
Video

2010
01:38:26,688 --> 01:38:30,272
And he was on Alexander Dugan show over video

2011
01:38:30,528 --> 01:38:33,600
But he did not actually

2012
01:38:34,368 --> 01:38:34,880
His

2013
01:38:35,392 --> 01:38:38,464
Because I believe if you are photographed

2014
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:46,144
What reason I brought that up is cuz one of the things he screams about all the time is like

2015
01:38:46,656 --> 01:38:49,216
Just to make sure you didn't fall into one of

2016
01:38:49,472 --> 01:38:50,240
What is tropes

2017
01:38:51,264 --> 01:38:51,776
Notes there

2018
01:38:57,152 --> 01:38:57,920
The election

2019
01:38:59,712 --> 01:39:00,224
Both

2020
01:39:02,272 --> 01:39:02,784
True

2021
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:06,112
Like and the worst part is

2022
01:39:06,624 --> 01:39:07,648
It's under

2023
01:39:09,696 --> 01:39:10,464
It's an

2024
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:13,280
Nobody's nobody's actually looking into it

2025
01:39:13,536 --> 01:39:18,400
All of the all of the attorney generals and all of those people in

2026
01:39:18,912 --> 01:39:20,704
Election

2027
01:39:21,472 --> 01:39:22,496
Committees or whatever it is

2028
01:39:23,008 --> 01:39:27,360
They've all said it probably didn't happen probably none of them

2029
01:39:27,616 --> 01:39:28,384
Actually looked into

2030
01:39:28,896 --> 01:39:30,688
Yeah

2031
01:39:32,224 --> 01:39:34,272
And with what we know that the Russians

2032
01:39:34,528 --> 01:39:37,600
Can do as far as tearing down a grid and all of this

2033
01:39:38,368 --> 01:39:40,160
It's hard to imagine that they would think

2034
01:39:40,672 --> 01:39:41,184
Beyond

2035
01:39:42,464 --> 01:39:44,256
Even with

2036
01:39:44,768 --> 01:39:48,096
Yeah there is something to be said for like

2037
01:39:48,352 --> 01:39:51,680
Maybe you don't actually flip switches and change

2038
01:39:51,936 --> 01:39:52,448
What have you

2039
01:39:53,472 --> 01:39:54,752
Hacking the voter rolls

2040
01:39:55,008 --> 01:39:58,592
Preemptively there's ways you can Purge people from voting

2041
01:39:58,848 --> 01:40:00,128
And that's as good as change

2042
01:40:01,664 --> 01:40:04,224
Making it so people who can vote people to

2043
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:07,808
So

2044
01:40:08,064 --> 01:40:08,832
As well as

2045
01:40:09,344 --> 01:40:11,392
Yeah it's full of s*** there

2046
01:40:14,208 --> 01:40:16,000
The Lord's work

2047
01:40:16,256 --> 01:40:17,280
He's becoming like

2048
01:40:19,584 --> 01:40:21,120
It's like handing is

2049
01:40:22,912 --> 01:40:27,520
He's old

2050
01:40:27,776 --> 01:40:30,080
You know why

2051
01:40:31,616 --> 01:40:32,128
Glenn Beck

2052
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:42,880
Got to plug in Amity

2053
01:40:43,136 --> 01:40:44,928
Actually

2054
01:40:45,184 --> 01:40:48,000
Tucker Carlson

2055
01:40:48,256 --> 01:40:49,536
He's not really Alex Jones

2056
01:40:52,352 --> 01:40:57,728
He's very you Freddy trust fund the douche bro

2057
01:40:57,984 --> 01:40:59,264
Republican

2058
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:00,032
But

2059
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:03,360
I wanted this thing is starting to dawn on me

2060
01:41:03,616 --> 01:41:04,128
Me too

2061
01:41:04,384 --> 01:41:07,968
Is this actually end up being a bigger speech that I mean it to

2062
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:13,344
We will fight them on the beaches

2063
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:15,392
Do not be that inspire

2064
01:41:16,672 --> 01:41:18,464
One of the things I'm starting to realize

2065
01:41:21,024 --> 01:41:22,560
Alex for a bit

2066
01:41:23,072 --> 01:41:24,096
Start

2067
01:41:24,352 --> 01:41:25,376
To see his narrative

2068
01:41:25,632 --> 01:41:27,424
Playing out in larger culture

2069
01:41:27,936 --> 01:41:28,960
Publication

2070
01:41:29,216 --> 01:41:31,520
Videos that are posted of Hannity

2071
01:41:31,776 --> 01:41:32,800
And Tucker Carlson

2072
01:41:33,824 --> 01:41:34,336
Friends

2073
01:41:34,592 --> 01:41:35,360
Even

2074
01:41:38,688 --> 01:41:41,248
Responding to the narratives that are being played out

2075
01:41:41,504 --> 01:41:42,528
Alex Jones

2076
01:41:42,784 --> 01:41:43,552
Style narrative

2077
01:41:43,808 --> 01:41:44,576
Sir Alex Jones

2078
01:41:44,832 --> 01:41:45,600
Talking

2079
01:41:46,368 --> 01:41:48,672
I'm not saying this early they originated with him

2080
01:41:48,928 --> 01:41:50,208
But they are that

2081
01:41:50,464 --> 01:41:53,280
Drudge Breitbart Alex Jones world of narrative

2082
01:41:54,304 --> 01:41:55,072
Before there was a

2083
01:41:55,328 --> 01:41:56,096
Think different

2084
01:41:56,608 --> 01:41:58,400
Between the stories that Alex Jones

2085
01:41:58,656 --> 01:42:00,192
Hotel and he's wacko bubble

2086
01:42:00,448 --> 01:42:02,496
Even on Fox News

2087
01:42:03,264 --> 01:42:06,336
There would be a line between them and now there's not

2088
01:42:06,848 --> 01:42:10,176
There is just those worlds are essentially come together

2089
01:42:10,688 --> 01:42:14,272
Anything that I think is super irresponsible is that I

2090
01:42:14,784 --> 01:42:17,088
People talking about how dumb they are

2091
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:21,696
Picking up people writing articles people on MSNBC or CNN

2092
01:42:21,952 --> 01:42:23,232
Talking about how these

2093
01:42:23,488 --> 01:42:24,000
Things Are

2094
01:42:24,256 --> 01:42:24,768
Stupid

2095
01:42:26,048 --> 01:42:28,864
And none of them are addressing the fact that when you

2096
01:42:29,376 --> 01:42:31,168
When you talk about Alex Jones narrative

2097
01:42:31,424 --> 01:42:33,728
You can't talk about it outside of this

2098
01:42:33,984 --> 01:42:35,520
Umbrella of globalist

2099
01:42:36,288 --> 01:42:41,408
You can't because if you don't you're not getting why he's

2100
01:42:41,664 --> 01:42:42,944
He's mad about ex wires

2101
01:42:43,456 --> 01:42:49,088
So even Media Matters I know they're aware of it and they probably talked about him being obsessed with globalist at some point

2102
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:50,112
But if

2103
01:42:50,368 --> 01:42:52,928
Even when they post these videos of like

2104
01:42:53,184 --> 01:42:56,000
Robert David Steele coming on in talking about Mars

2105
01:42:56,768 --> 01:42:58,304
When they like Drop It

2106
01:42:58,560 --> 01:42:59,840
Peter Schiff

2107
01:43:00,096 --> 01:43:01,632
Adam Schiff

2108
01:43:02,144 --> 01:43:04,192
Leadership is the guy who tells you to buy gold

2109
01:43:04,704 --> 01:43:06,496
Screaming at him

2110
01:43:06,752 --> 01:43:07,520
Did you clock sucker

2111
01:43:07,776 --> 01:43:08,544
All that stuff

2112
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:09,312
Dayton

2113
01:43:09,568 --> 01:43:10,080
People don't

2114
01:43:10,592 --> 01:43:11,872
Bring into like

2115
01:43:12,384 --> 01:43:14,432
The reason that he's mad about that

2116
01:43:14,688 --> 01:43:17,504
Is a fictional narrative that he has in his head about global

2117
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:19,040
Central Bank

2118
01:43:19,296 --> 01:43:20,576
And I just think

2119
01:43:20,832 --> 01:43:26,720
I think that the longer that we don't deal with that the longer or the more likely it is to become a saint

2120
01:43:26,976 --> 01:43:27,488
Sir problem

2121
01:43:28,512 --> 01:43:34,144
If there's an inundation of Alex Jones's worldview into media into

2122
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:35,424
Supposedly

2123
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:39,008
Mainstream media without an understanding of what

2124
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:40,032
Comes from

2125
01:43:40,544 --> 01:43:44,640
You run the risk of people being tricked into believing something they don't realize

2126
01:43:44,896 --> 01:43:45,920
What they're reading

2127
01:43:46,176 --> 01:43:47,200
What they're getting in

2128
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:50,016
Say what you want about

2129
01:43:50,528 --> 01:43:51,808
I think a lot of bad things about it

2130
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:53,088
At least

2131
01:43:53,344 --> 01:43:55,392
He's very upfront about the fact

2132
01:43:55,648 --> 01:43:57,440
Camaros

2133
01:43:57,696 --> 01:44:00,512
That he thinks the globalists are trying to kill your family

2134
01:44:02,816 --> 01:44:06,912
At least on his sleeve so if you think that's crazy

2135
01:44:08,448 --> 01:44:12,544
Thank you. He lies about his sources and stuff like that but it

2136
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:13,312
Is Donald Trump

2137
01:44:13,568 --> 01:44:15,616
Clearwater

2138
01:44:15,872 --> 01:44:17,920
Weirdly

2139
01:44:19,456 --> 01:44:19,968
Not prompted

2140
01:44:20,224 --> 01:44:21,504
Self

2141
01:44:22,528 --> 01:44:24,320
Do you understand what I'm saying

2142
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:27,648
Just hit me there

2143
01:44:27,904 --> 01:44:28,416
Is that

2144
01:44:28,672 --> 01:44:31,488
He's always lying about his sources and you know that

2145
01:44:31,744 --> 01:44:33,024
Because when he has a real one

2146
01:44:33,536 --> 01:44:39,168
He gets so excited

2147
01:44:39,424 --> 01:44:40,704
I think you're absolutely right

2148
01:44:41,216 --> 01:44:41,984
In that

2149
01:44:43,008 --> 01:44:43,776
What is

2150
01:44:44,032 --> 01:44:44,544
What I see

2151
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:45,312
Be happening

2152
01:44:45,824 --> 01:44:46,848
Is his protro

2153
01:44:49,152 --> 01:44:49,664
Because

2154
01:44:50,176 --> 01:44:50,944
Because he's

2155
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:52,224
The only one who

2156
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:53,504
Is really just kind of

2157
01:44:54,016 --> 01:44:54,528
Wacky

2158
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:56,576
And throwing out anything again

2159
01:44:56,832 --> 01:44:57,344
Against the wall

2160
01:44:57,856 --> 01:44:59,648
You can listen to his show

2161
01:44:59,904 --> 01:45:01,184
And most of it's lunacy

2162
01:45:01,696 --> 01:45:02,464
But you'll get like

2163
01:45:02,720 --> 01:45:03,232
Oh this is

2164
01:45:03,488 --> 01:45:04,512
Is a good office station

2165
01:45:05,792 --> 01:45:06,304
Something that I can

2166
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:07,584
Can pull and put on Fox

2167
01:45:08,352 --> 01:45:09,376
It's not the globalist

2168
01:45:09,632 --> 01:45:10,400
It's not all that

2169
01:45:10,912 --> 01:45:12,448
Until when you go on

2170
01:45:13,216 --> 01:45:14,496
And you're a Democrat

2171
01:45:15,008 --> 01:45:15,520
Undead or

2172
01:45:16,032 --> 01:45:16,544
Or whomever

2173
01:45:17,056 --> 01:45:17,824
And you're engaged

2174
01:45:18,080 --> 01:45:19,104
With this argument

2175
01:45:19,616 --> 01:45:20,384
You're engaging

2176
01:45:20,640 --> 01:45:21,152
The surface

2177
01:45:24,992 --> 01:45:25,504
Comes from

2178
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:29,088
Problem with it is is if you do.

2179
01:45:29,344 --> 01:45:29,856
Into the

2180
01:45:30,112 --> 01:45:32,160
So if you get rid of all the surface

2181
01:45:33,184 --> 01:45:39,328
Like it explodes from within like as once you pop that balloon or whatever it all the water that's inside it

2182
01:45:40,608 --> 01:45:41,120
Yeah

2183
01:45:41,376 --> 01:45:42,144
Well ended

2184
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:43,680
To me it is again

2185
01:45:43,936 --> 01:45:44,704
The way that the

2186
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:45,984
The KKK was

2187
01:45:46,240 --> 01:45:46,752
Defeated

2188
01:45:47,008 --> 01:45:47,520
In the 50

2189
01:45:48,032 --> 01:45:48,544
Was with

2190
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:49,824
The Superman radio show

2191
01:45:50,336 --> 01:45:53,408
Yeah that's true

2192
01:45:54,432 --> 01:45:55,200
Information to Super

2193
01:45:55,968 --> 01:45:57,760
About how these guys are

2194
01:45:58,784 --> 01:45:59,296
Billy

2195
01:45:59,552 --> 01:46:01,088
The Wizards are not

2196
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:04,160
But their power

2197
01:46:04,672 --> 01:46:05,440
Is a

2198
01:46:05,696 --> 01:46:06,464
False front

2199
01:46:06,720 --> 01:46:07,488
For how silly and

2200
01:46:07,744 --> 01:46:08,256
Childish things

2201
01:46:11,328 --> 01:46:11,840
People are

2202
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:13,632
Is men's rights

2203
01:46:13,888 --> 01:46:14,912
All these men's rights

2204
01:46:15,424 --> 01:46:16,448
All the people say

2205
01:46:16,704 --> 01:46:18,240
Liberals are snowflakes

2206
01:46:18,496 --> 01:46:22,080
And then the moment they get even a little bit

2207
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:27,712
We're going to go out and fight with antifa

2208
01:46:28,224 --> 01:46:28,736
You guys punch

2209
01:46:28,992 --> 01:46:33,856
Each other in name cereals as a jumping in ritual as a f****** idiot

2210
01:46:35,392 --> 01:46:36,416
Why would you want

2211
01:46:37,952 --> 01:46:39,488
ICICI

2212
01:46:41,792 --> 01:46:42,304
Because they

2213
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:43,840
They're getting into this

2214
01:46:44,864 --> 01:46:46,912
One thing that's going to release their

2215
01:46:48,704 --> 01:46:50,752
Yeah and what they're really doing is

2216
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:52,544
Nothing more than a lark

2217
01:46:53,056 --> 01:46:56,384
Not like that really white version of Second Life

2218
01:47:01,248 --> 01:47:02,528
You know on the inside

2219
01:47:03,296 --> 01:47:04,832
There is nothing but

2220
01:47:05,344 --> 01:47:07,392
A small little boy who's afraid of women

2221
01:47:07,648 --> 01:47:08,672
And Olympic

2222
01:47:08,928 --> 01:47:10,464
Yeah

2223
01:47:10,720 --> 01:47:11,232
I don't know

2224
01:47:11,488 --> 01:47:12,000
I'm scared

2225
01:47:14,304 --> 01:47:14,816
Coming

2226
01:47:16,096 --> 01:47:17,376
People need to

2227
01:47:17,632 --> 01:47:18,144
The dress

2228
01:47:18,656 --> 01:47:20,192
Their idea of globalist

2229
01:47:20,448 --> 01:47:21,216
Somehow it relates

2230
01:47:21,728 --> 01:47:22,240
2

2231
01:47:24,288 --> 01:47:27,104
And bigotry but we'll deal with that another time

2232
01:47:39,904 --> 01:47:41,440
And the burnings and all this s***

2233
01:47:41,952 --> 01:47:43,488
And all of that stuff is

2234
01:47:43,744 --> 01:47:45,280
Currently being perpetrated

2235
01:47:45,536 --> 01:47:46,560
By the very people who

2236
01:47:46,816 --> 01:47:47,328
He's saying

2237
01:47:47,584 --> 01:47:48,608
To a beeper

2238
01:47:48,864 --> 01:47:49,376
Prepared for it

2239
01:47:49,632 --> 01:47:52,960
Yeah Oklahoma

2240
01:47:53,216 --> 01:47:57,312
Some guy blew up an Army recruiting center

2241
01:47:57,568 --> 01:47:59,104
Former Army guy

2242
01:47:59,360 --> 01:48:00,128
Horse Sprite

2243
01:48:00,384 --> 01:48:00,896
It's it's

2244
01:48:01,152 --> 01:48:02,176
Yeah it's a lot like

2245
01:48:03,200 --> 01:48:03,712
You know

2246
01:48:04,224 --> 01:48:05,504
The opening line of pride

2247
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:06,272
Prejudice

2248
01:48:06,784 --> 01:48:08,576
Where what it means is being version

2249
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:11,392
So in the same way that what Alex

2250
01:48:11,648 --> 01:48:13,696
To saying is be prepared for the standings

2251
01:48:14,208 --> 01:48:15,488
He doesn't mean be ready

2252
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:18,560
He means start stabbing

2253
01:48:18,816 --> 01:48:19,584
Bright bright

2254
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:21,888
Like what do you mean

2255
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:24,192
I agree with that that's what he said

2256
01:48:25,216 --> 01:48:25,984
Exactly

2257
01:48:26,496 --> 01:48:27,008
Great

2258
01:48:27,264 --> 01:48:28,288
Madness

2259
01:48:28,544 --> 01:48:29,824
Let's move along

2260
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:31,360
We got this next clip here

2261
01:48:33,152 --> 01:48:34,944
A little bit more about that

2262
01:48:35,200 --> 01:48:35,968
Speech in Poland

2263
01:48:40,576 --> 01:48:46,720
Invading Poland

2264
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,560
Hate Christians

2265
01:48:51,072 --> 01:48:52,352
We hate Protestants

2266
01:48:55,168 --> 01:48:57,984
Pedophile Pope

2267
01:49:03,616 --> 01:49:07,456
Globalism

2268
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:15,136
Trump campaign

2269
01:49:15,392 --> 01:49:21,536
They make it all racial what about the decline of the way maker

2270
01:49:38,176 --> 01:49:40,992
Yes I will

2271
01:49:42,016 --> 01:49:46,880
North Korea

2272
01:49:47,648 --> 01:49:49,184
It's not compatible

2273
01:49:49,696 --> 01:49:51,488
Weird hypotheticals

2274
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:53,280
Here is that

2275
01:49:54,048 --> 01:49:59,168
Are you sick cuz I'm kind of bored with that too

2276
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:11,456
Will Thrive and hours

2277
01:50:12,736 --> 01:50:18,368
Rodger Stone

2278
01:50:22,208 --> 01:50:24,000
Stop the triggers White

2279
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:26,304
People will

2280
01:50:26,816 --> 01:50:30,144
Exceed our civilization prosper

2281
01:50:30,656 --> 01:50:32,704
Will Triumph

2282
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:34,240
What are we what are we

2283
01:50:34,496 --> 01:50:37,824
Talking about when we say the West is South America included

2284
01:50:38,336 --> 01:50:39,104
Morrow

2285
01:50:39,872 --> 01:50:46,016
Mexico's part of the West let's build a wall

2286
01:50:46,272 --> 01:50:47,296
In the middle

2287
01:50:49,088 --> 01:50:53,696
What are we

2288
01:50:54,208 --> 01:50:56,000
Africa's right underneath

2289
01:50:56,256 --> 01:50:57,280
That's why I Alex

2290
01:50:57,536 --> 01:50:58,816
Is really more accurate

2291
01:51:02,144 --> 01:51:05,728
More accurate whenever Alex really talks about like white

2292
01:51:06,240 --> 01:51:08,800
Some dump that's why you talkin about like they hate

2293
01:51:09,056 --> 01:51:10,080
White people they hate

2294
01:51:10,336 --> 01:51:11,872
Catholics hate Protestants

2295
01:51:12,128 --> 01:51:16,224
Yeah that's all he's really triggered by that's all he cares about

2296
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:19,296
When he talks about the West it is code for white

2297
01:51:19,552 --> 01:51:20,064
Christians

2298
01:51:20,576 --> 01:51:22,368
That's essentially what he's talking about

2299
01:51:22,624 --> 01:51:25,184
I need the flex by sayings

2300
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:27,488
Right after he White

2301
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:29,280
Protestants and Catholics

2302
01:51:29,792 --> 01:51:31,584
As of the groups that are leading Defender

2303
01:51:32,608 --> 01:51:35,424
So I hate I hate

2304
01:51:35,680 --> 01:51:38,752
I also hate the pedophile Pope

2305
01:51:39,008 --> 01:51:41,568
If he if he is indeed

2306
01:51:43,872 --> 01:51:44,640
Is not

2307
01:51:46,176 --> 01:51:48,224
Information on that

2308
01:51:54,624 --> 01:51:56,672
I'm not here to defend the Catholic Church

2309
01:51:57,696 --> 01:52:00,768
Innovation they've done a lot of bad stuff in the past I'm not here to pretend that's not the

2310
01:52:01,280 --> 01:52:02,304
At the same time

2311
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:04,096
I've seen no evidence that the

2312
01:52:04,352 --> 01:52:05,888
The pope himself as a pedophile

2313
01:52:06,912 --> 01:52:08,448
How do you

2314
01:52:08,704 --> 01:52:12,032
How can you possibly say that the weather

2315
01:52:13,056 --> 01:52:13,824
How can you possibly

2316
01:52:14,080 --> 01:52:15,104
Simply say that the West

2317
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:16,384
Is at all

2318
01:52:16,640 --> 01:52:17,152
Geographical

2319
01:52:18,176 --> 01:52:18,688
Of course

2320
01:52:19,200 --> 01:52:19,968
Like white culture

2321
01:52:22,016 --> 01:52:24,064
What do you think

2322
01:52:24,576 --> 01:52:25,856
That because it's so true

2323
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:29,184
If you've seen a f****** globe

2324
01:52:30,208 --> 01:52:31,232
Now if the world is

2325
01:52:33,792 --> 01:52:37,632
Classically the term Western world is Europe in America

2326
01:52:37,888 --> 01:52:38,656
That's what it

2327
01:52:40,192 --> 01:52:41,728
Because they're white

2328
01:52:42,240 --> 01:52:43,264
Exactly

2329
01:52:44,544 --> 01:52:45,056
Point proven

2330
01:52:45,312 --> 01:52:48,896
That's why when Alex talks about like they hate your family's he's talking about white

2331
01:52:49,664 --> 01:52:51,200
You talk about traditional two-point

2332
01:52:51,456 --> 01:52:52,480
Three children

2333
01:52:52,736 --> 01:52:53,248
5

2334
01:52:53,504 --> 01:52:54,784
If you know you have two cars

2335
01:52:55,040 --> 01:52:55,552
Picket fence

2336
01:52:55,808 --> 01:52:56,832
Wife doesn't have a job

2337
01:52:57,088 --> 01:52:58,368
White family system

2338
01:53:03,488 --> 01:53:06,560
Muslims

2339
01:53:06,816 --> 01:53:08,096
You know what I was

2340
01:53:08,352 --> 01:53:10,144
About earlier today I had this really weird

2341
01:53:10,400 --> 01:53:10,912
Stray thought

2342
01:53:11,424 --> 01:53:15,264
Did the world Alex Jones really wants to live in

2343
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:19,360
No that was that was earlier

2344
01:53:22,944 --> 01:53:25,760
At the thought that I had that Alex Jones wants to live in

2345
01:53:26,272 --> 01:53:28,576
Could be said in that future is

2346
01:53:29,088 --> 01:53:31,136
Hey remember when people were gay that was weird

2347
01:53:31,392 --> 01:53:37,536
Yeah you're right that's the kind of future he wants to live at your absolute where I think everybody is

2348
01:53:37,792 --> 01:53:39,584
Confused about

2349
01:53:39,840 --> 01:53:43,680
How crazy was that remember when we allowed abortion

2350
01:53:43,936 --> 01:53:47,008
Different races

2351
01:53:48,032 --> 01:53:49,568
I didn't just have their own countries

2352
01:53:51,104 --> 01:53:52,128
Yeah that's kind of

2353
01:53:52,896 --> 01:53:54,176
It's really bizarre but

2354
01:53:55,968 --> 01:53:56,736
It's not far off

2355
01:53:56,992 --> 01:53:59,552
If you if you look at the mirroring that goes on but

2356
01:54:00,832 --> 01:54:01,344
Can white National

2357
01:54:02,112 --> 01:54:05,440
Avenue extrapolate that a little farther and see what the white nationalist

2358
01:54:05,696 --> 01:54:06,208
Say

2359
01:54:06,464 --> 01:54:08,512
Like what the Stormfront people in

2360
01:54:08,768 --> 01:54:10,048
Lorena

2361
01:54:10,304 --> 01:54:11,328
What they're really into

2362
01:54:11,584 --> 01:54:13,376
What are the things about a bunch

2363
01:54:13,888 --> 01:54:15,168

2364
01:54:15,424 --> 01:54:17,728
Write America for the white people

2365
01:54:17,984 --> 01:54:19,264
The Mexico for the Mexico

2366

I like you all have your discreet play serial hey have fun over there I don't hate you I don't want to kill you

2368
01:54:28,736 --> 01:54:30,016
Can't we carve out a spot

2369
01:54:30,272 --> 01:54:32,320
Google

2370
01:54:32,576 --> 01:54:34,368
In Siberia and call it just

2371
01:54:34,624 --> 01:54:40,512
But what I'm getting at I'm not sure that's terrible idea and everybody else for everywhere

2372
01:54:41,536 --> 01:54:42,560
What I'm getting at is

2373
01:54:42,816 --> 01:54:43,840
I don't know if it's

2374
01:54:44,864 --> 01:54:45,632
Insane

2375
01:54:45,888 --> 01:54:46,912
Extrapolated Alex Jones

2376
01:54:47,168 --> 01:54:48,192
Kind of alright with that

2377
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:49,472
Lake

2378
01:54:49,728 --> 01:54:54,080
Based on how much mirroring an overlap he has with white nationalism right is it

2379
01:54:54,336 --> 01:54:57,152
Insane to think that more extreme white nationalist position

2380
01:54:57,664 --> 01:54:58,688
Are things the key

2381
01:55:02,016 --> 01:55:03,040
Is transphobia

2382
01:55:03,296 --> 01:55:03,808
Suggest that

2383
01:55:04,576 --> 01:55:05,344
You know hey

2384
01:55:06,112 --> 01:55:06,880
There shouldn't be

2385
01:55:09,184 --> 01:55:10,464
That's what he is

2386
01:55:10,720 --> 01:55:12,768
Regardless regardless of

2387
01:55:13,024 --> 01:55:14,048
How far it goes

2388
01:55:14,560 --> 01:55:16,864
There are elements

2389
01:55:17,120 --> 01:55:20,448
That provable he supports Administration where the

2390
01:55:20,704 --> 01:55:21,472
Vice president

2391
01:55:21,984 --> 01:55:24,032
Thanks VIP gay is something that you should

2392
01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:25,312
He taught not to

Education secretary

Or whatever

2396
01:55:30,432 --> 01:55:32,224
Came outside

2397
01:55:32,480 --> 01:55:33,504
God

2398
01:55:35,296 --> 01:55:36,320

My

2404
01:55:45,792 --> 01:55:46,816
What is

2405
01:55:47,584 --> 01:55:48,096
My my

2406
01:55:49,888 --> 01:55:50,656
I guess I guess my

2407
01:55:52,448 --> 01:55:53,728
Is that there are going to

2408
01:55:53,984 --> 01:55:54,496
Tubi

2409
01:55:55,520 --> 01:55:56,032
It's going to be

2410
01:55:56,800 --> 01:55:57,312
Ground up

2411
01:55:57,824 --> 01:56:00,896
Right but it's going to be from the ground up

2412
01:56:01,152 --> 01:56:02,688
So if you have your edges

2413
01:56:04,224 --> 01:56:04,736
Saying that

2414
01:56:06,016 --> 01:56:06,528
That mean

2415
01:56:06,784 --> 01:56:07,552
There are plates

2416
01:56:08,064 --> 01:56:08,832
That are going

2417
01:56:09,344 --> 01:56:09,856
Reject it

2418
01:56:10,624 --> 01:56:11,904
But there are places that are

2419
01:56:12,416 --> 01:56:12,928
Into a

2420
01:56:13,696 --> 01:56:18,560
There already are there books rights activist groups

2421
01:56:18,816 --> 01:56:20,608
We're becoming more sector

2422
01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:23,168
From the ground up

2423
01:56:23,424 --> 01:56:24,960
Instead of a federal kind

2424
01:56:25,728 --> 01:56:26,496
Then laws app

2425
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:28,032
Insert

2426
01:56:28,288 --> 01:56:28,800
Places

2427
01:56:29,056 --> 01:56:31,104
Means that the country is

2428
01:56:38,016 --> 01:56:38,784
And frankly at this point

2429
01:56:39,296 --> 01:56:41,600
I'm halfway elect

2430
01:56:41,856 --> 01:56:42,624

Information that I'm going to drop

No more

2445
01:57:41,504 --> 01:57:43,808
It's also not at all like

It's

2450
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:53,536
His his narrative seems to

2451
01:57:53,792 --> 01:57:55,584
To come from the idea that Russia is

2452
01:57:56,352 --> 01:57:57,120
Both sides

2453
01:57:58,400 --> 01:58:00,704

01:59:13,664 --> 01:59:15,712
The forfeiture case was heralded as a Time

2476
01:59:15,968 --> 01:59:18,784
At the time as a significant step toward uncovering

2477
01:59:19,040 --> 01:59:21,344
An unwinding a complex money-laundering scheme

2478
01:59:21,600 --> 01:59:24,416
Arising from a notorious foreign fraud

2479
01:59:24,928 --> 01:59:25,696
As alleged

2480
01:59:25,952 --> 01:59:29,024
A Russian criminal Enterprise.

2481
01:59:29,280 --> 01:59:30,304
Vanille gotten ruble

2482
01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:31,072

The pricey Manhattan realest

2484
01:59:33,376 --> 01:59:33,888
But

2485
01:59:34,144 --> 01:59:39,264
Proceeding with the trial is scheduled the justice department settled the case two days before it was

2486

Quote we write with some

2491
01:59:48,992 --> 01:59:51,296
Concerned that these two events might be connected

Have at the department sataloff

2493
01:59:54,112 --> 01:59:55,136
For the United States in order to

01:59:55,392 --> 01:59:56,672
Obscure the underlying facts

2495
01:59:56,928 --> 01:59:57,440
Brookside

In a letter to sessions on Wednesday

2499
02:00:03,072 --> 02:00:04,608

Sergei magnitsky

2503
02:00:09,472 --> 02:00:11,008
Mysteriously

2504
02:00:12,800 --> 02:00:16,896
As a result us lawmakers passed the magnitsky ACT

2505
02:00:17,152 --> 02:00:19,200
Which levied sanctions on Russian officials

2506
02:00:19,712 --> 02:00:20,224
Sanction

2507
02:00:20,480 --> 02:00:22,784

The Russian

Also the attorney representing the Russian companies in the Department of Justice

2511
02:00:32,512 --> 02:00:34,560
Okay

2512
02:00:35,072 --> 02:00:38,400
Is the same one who organized the meeting with Donald Trump jr.

2513
02:00:38,656 --> 02:00:40,448
Antop Trump campaign officials in June

2514

02:00:41,728 --> 02:00:42,752
Dolphin material that could

2516
02:00:43,008 --> 02:00:45,312
Incriminate Democratic presidential candidate Hillary

2517
02:00:45,824 --> 02:00:46,592
Quote love it

2518
02:00:46,848 --> 02:00:48,384
Responded Trump jr. to an intermediate

2519
02:00:51,456 --> 02:00:53,248
Connected

2520
02:01:01,696 --> 02:01:02,720
People in jail forever

2521
02:01:02,976 --> 02:01:04,768
I don't know

2522
02:01:05,280 --> 02:01:07,072
Isn't that super f***** up

2523
02:01:09,888 --> 02:01:10,400
It's not like

2524
02:01:11,168 --> 02:01:11,680
Unheard

2525
02:01:16,032 --> 02:01:17,824
It's not far for the course given all the Cirque

2526
02:01:22,432 --> 02:01:23,712
Bringing this case

2527
02:01:23,968 --> 02:01:24,736
Cease fire

2528
02:01:25,248 --> 02:01:25,760
Then

2529
02:01:26,016 --> 02:01:27,296
The Department of Justice

2530
02:01:27,808 --> 02:01:29,344
Only gives Mac

2531
02:01:29,600 --> 02:01:30,624
6 million-dollar

2532
02:01:30,880 --> 02:01:32,672
Penalty

2533
02:01:32,928 --> 02:01:34,208
The 200 million dollars

2534
02:01:36,512 --> 02:01:37,024
This Brodsky

2535
02:01:37,280 --> 02:01:38,048
Wow

2536
02:01:39,584 --> 02:01:43,424
Russian illegal money coming into being filtered through

2537
02:01:44,448 --> 02:01:46,752
Pricey Manhattan real estate which is what

2538
02:01:48,544 --> 02:01:49,568
It's so f******

2539
02:01:49,824 --> 02:01:53,408
Clear all this is going on at that meeting

2540
02:01:53,664 --> 02:01:54,688
That's all they had

2541
02:01:55,200 --> 02:01:57,248
I imagine that might of come up

2542
02:01:57,504 --> 02:01:58,528
Reminder

2543
02:01:58,784 --> 02:02:00,064
Mighty Mike

2544
02:02:00,320 --> 02:02:01,856
My toes

2545
02:02:02,368 --> 02:02:03,392
Burlington

2546
02:02:03,648 --> 02:02:05,184
Yes

2547
02:02:05,440 --> 02:02:06,720
You gotta bring it up

2548
02:02:06,976 --> 02:02:09,536
Dude I'm much better job for nothing today Monday

2549
02:02:10,048 --> 02:02:13,888
340i had a whole article to read

2550
02:02:14,144 --> 02:02:16,960
So all all the stuff she has pictures

2551
02:02:17,216 --> 02:02:20,544
I looked at the pictures that Alex's posted I see no evidence

2552
02:02:20,800 --> 02:02:21,824
They are all from the women

2553
02:02:22,592 --> 02:02:23,360
Are there negative

2554
02:02:23,616 --> 02:02:24,384
Trump signs

2555
02:02:24,640 --> 02:02:25,664
I mean of course

2556
02:02:26,432 --> 02:02:29,248
But the idea

2557
02:02:30,016 --> 02:02:35,648
Appalachian

2558
02:02:35,904 --> 02:02:37,440
He accepted a meeting

2559
02:02:37,696 --> 02:02:38,208
About

2560
02:02:38,464 --> 02:02:41,792
Hillary Clinton

2561
02:02:42,048 --> 02:02:43,328
Right I think that this stuff is

2562
02:02:43,584 --> 02:02:44,608
The super involved in that

2563
02:02:44,864 --> 02:02:46,912
What we're seeing

2564
02:02:47,424 --> 02:02:48,704
Is possibly

2565
02:02:49,728 --> 02:02:50,496
Massive

2566
02:02:50,752 --> 02:02:51,520
Money laundering

2567
02:02:52,544 --> 02:02:53,824
What's really amazing

2568
02:02:55,616 --> 02:02:56,896
What we're discovering

2569
02:02:57,408 --> 02:02:58,688
Is that the globalist

2570
02:02:59,200 --> 02:02:59,968
Are real

2571
02:03:00,224 --> 02:03:03,552
Amir Imam

2572
02:03:07,136 --> 02:03:09,184
Who are stealing everything from

2573
02:03:09,440 --> 02:03:13,024
Nongovernmental organizations

2574
02:03:13,280 --> 02:03:14,304
It's not the EU

2575
02:03:14,560 --> 02:03:15,584
It's not government

2576
02:03:15,840 --> 02:03:18,400
Except for now Trump is in our government

2577
02:03:18,656 --> 02:03:22,752
But it is like a International

2578
02:03:23,264 --> 02:03:23,776
Yeah

2579
02:03:26,336 --> 02:03:28,128
And they are going

2580
02:03:29,152 --> 02:03:31,456
We're not discovering that so much as it's looking

2581
02:03:34,016 --> 02:03:36,320
Stay Together

2582
02:03:38,112 --> 02:03:38,624
Maybe

2583
02:03:39,136 --> 02:03:41,696
That's why this investigation is taking a long time

2584
02:03:41,952 --> 02:03:45,280
Abe maybe why a lot of the people

2585
02:03:45,536 --> 02:03:46,816
Before the election

2586
02:03:47,072 --> 02:03:49,888
Who saw this information in the summer of 2000

2587
02:03:50,144 --> 02:03:50,656
16

2588
02:03:50,912 --> 02:03:51,680
I didn't want to act

2589
02:03:52,192 --> 02:03:52,960
Yeah

2590
02:03:54,496 --> 02:03:55,008
That's a good

2591
02:03:55,264 --> 02:03:57,568
Can you imagine how like

2592
02:03:57,824 --> 02:04:00,896
Shattering some of this would be to come out during the election

2593
02:04:04,224 --> 02:04:07,552
Cancel our government right now

2594
02:04:07,808 --> 02:04:10,112
It would be better if we just cancelled the elect

2595
02:04:10,624 --> 02:04:12,928
I don't know the other thing

2596
02:04:13,184 --> 02:04:16,000
So this investigation does come out

2597
02:04:16,256 --> 02:04:17,536
And what is obvious

2598
02:04:18,304 --> 02:04:18,816
Becomes

2599
02:04:19,072 --> 02:04:20,096
Baby

2600
02:04:21,376 --> 02:04:22,912
What the f*** do we do

2601
02:04:23,424 --> 02:04:27,520
Yeah cuz that means you're going to have to try and take down f******

2602
02:04:27,776 --> 02:04:29,568
Like it's a RICO case

2603
02:04:31,104 --> 02:04:32,384
How to take down f****** ever

2604
02:04:32,896 --> 02:04:36,480
Take down the people

2605
02:04:36,992 --> 02:04:39,296
And our government that are involved

2606
02:04:39,552 --> 02:04:40,064
But that's

2607
02:04:40,576 --> 02:04:46,720
Come close to the network and all that stuff

2608
02:04:46,976 --> 02:04:49,280
We get further into that and you start going back

2609
02:04:49,536 --> 02:04:52,096
I can to the people who poured money

2610
02:04:55,424 --> 02:04:58,496
How far away

2611
02:05:00,544 --> 02:05:02,080
Mercer is a global

2612
02:05:02,592 --> 02:05:06,176
F****** instigator in that he has influence multiple election

2613
02:05:06,432 --> 02:05:12,576
Around the world is I want us to stop speculating and stuff because I don't want us to drift into Alex

2614
02:05:12,832 --> 02:05:14,880
Jones arrest

2615
02:05:15,392 --> 02:05:16,672
People

2616
02:05:16,928 --> 02:05:20,256
I think you have enough to arrest Donald

2617
02:05:22,816 --> 02:05:23,328
He's in the hopper

2618
02:05:23,584 --> 02:05:25,120
He should be in jail and he should

2619
02:05:25,376 --> 02:05:25,888
Should not have

2620
02:05:26,144 --> 02:05:30,240
It doesn't get more of a Flight Risk than

2621
02:05:30,496 --> 02:05:33,312
Who has International connections

2622
02:05:33,568 --> 02:05:37,152
In hostile non-non extraditing countries

2623
02:05:37,408 --> 02:05:39,456
If anybody deserves solitary confined

2624
02:05:39,712 --> 02:05:40,736
It's Donald Trump jr.

2625
02:05:40,992 --> 02:05:43,040
Donald Trump

2626
02:05:43,552 --> 02:05:44,064
And I miss

2627
02:05:44,320 --> 02:05:44,832
Mitch McConnell

2628
02:05:45,088 --> 02:05:46,112
Paul Ryan

2629
02:05:46,368 --> 02:05:48,928
How many hours apart

2630
02:05:53,024 --> 02:05:53,536
Bizaardvark

2631
02:05:54,560 --> 02:05:55,072
Thankfully

2632
02:05:56,096 --> 02:05:56,608
Alex Jones

2633
02:05:57,632 --> 02:05:58,400
Gets Rodger Stone

2634
02:05:58,656 --> 02:05:59,168
In studio

2635
02:06:00,960 --> 02:06:01,472
Act

2636
02:06:04,032 --> 02:06:07,104
I get the feeling that Rodger stone is the only person who is

2637
02:06:07,360 --> 02:06:07,872
Going to walk away

2638
02:06:08,128 --> 02:06:12,224
From this like I honestly don't think Rodger Stone

2639
02:06:12,480 --> 02:06:12,992
Is a

2640
02:06:15,808 --> 02:06:16,576
He might be one

2641
02:06:16,832 --> 02:06:18,368
Love the Fall Guy

2642
02:06:19,136 --> 02:06:20,416
Not so much a patsy but

2643
02:06:20,672 --> 02:06:22,976
There's a reason they've kept him so on the outside

2644
02:06:23,488 --> 02:06:26,304
Like Trump saying I haven't talked to him in a long time

2645
02:06:26,560 --> 02:06:27,840
Publicly trying

2646
02:06:28,352 --> 02:06:28,864
Keep distance

2647
02:06:29,120 --> 02:06:29,888
He's never with them

2648
02:06:30,144 --> 02:06:31,936
He's not a part of the administration

2649
02:06:32,192 --> 02:06:34,240
I think there's a reason for that

2650
02:06:34,752 --> 02:06:35,264
He's too close

2651
02:06:35,776 --> 02:06:36,544
Like I wish

2652
02:06:36,800 --> 02:06:37,312
Bi hacker

2653
02:06:40,128 --> 02:06:41,152
He's just a bit player now

2654
02:06:41,664 --> 02:06:42,432
Like

2655
02:06:42,688 --> 02:06:45,248
If it was

2656
02:06:46,016 --> 02:06:46,784
Closed

2657
02:06:47,552 --> 02:06:49,088
You've you've easily got him a

2658
02:06:49,344 --> 02:06:49,856
Fall Guy

2659
02:06:50,112 --> 02:06:51,136
Now you're going up

2660
02:06:51,392 --> 02:06:52,416
After such bigger fish

2661
02:06:52,672 --> 02:06:54,208
With Rodger Stone

2662
02:06:54,464 --> 02:06:55,744
What are you trying to do with him

2663
02:06:57,280 --> 02:07:00,864
Yeah same way you're trying to flip your your manafort's and whomever

2664
02:07:01,632 --> 02:07:05,728
You're trying to do you extradite

2665
02:07:05,984 --> 02:07:06,752
Michaela

2666
02:07:07,264 --> 02:07:08,800
That's basically what you do there

2667
02:07:09,056 --> 02:07:09,824
That's not how we

2668
02:07:10,336 --> 02:07:12,384
American I apologize

2669
02:07:16,480 --> 02:07:20,320
But whether Rodger stone is the Fall Guy or not he is a guy

2670
02:07:21,600 --> 02:07:24,672
Have a little bit of a talk about

2671
02:07:24,928 --> 02:07:26,976
This side the situation with Junior

2672
02:07:27,488 --> 02:07:30,304
They want

2673
02:07:30,816 --> 02:07:33,376
About it

2674
02:07:37,472 --> 02:07:43,616
You deserve a medal an award

2675
02:07:50,272 --> 02:07:50,784
Rodger Stone

2676
02:07:51,040 --> 02:07:52,320
This is insane

2677
02:07:52,576 --> 02:07:58,208
July last year about Russia

2678
02:07:58,464 --> 02:08:00,256
Is involved in this

2679
02:08:00,512 --> 02:08:06,656
Volume

2680
02:08:06,912 --> 02:08:08,448
Subject

2681
02:08:08,960 --> 02:08:15,104
They change the subject

2682
02:08:15,360 --> 02:08:20,736
Classified

2683
02:08:23,552 --> 02:08:26,880
Publicly

2684
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,560
He's pretending that we didn't hear about

2685
02:08:34,816 --> 02:08:36,352
The fact that Trump

2686
02:08:36,864 --> 02:08:38,400
Emails from Russia

2687
02:08:38,656 --> 02:08:44,800
I've been reminded of that by myself and various

2688
02:08:45,056 --> 02:08:47,360
Twitter personality

2689
02:08:47,872 --> 02:08:50,176
Turn on my mind for over a year

2690
02:08:52,224 --> 02:08:52,992
George's been on

2691
02:09:01,440 --> 02:09:04,000
Trump was right when he said Russia

2692
02:09:05,024 --> 02:09:05,536
A month

2693
02:09:05,792 --> 02:09:09,632
His son met with a Russian agent because

2694
02:09:09,888 --> 02:09:11,424
She wasn't cut out for the globalist

2695
02:09:12,448 --> 02:09:12,960
Okay

2696
02:09:13,472 --> 02:09:14,240
All right well I buy it

2697
02:09:16,544 --> 02:09:19,360
Nation release

2698
02:09:19,616 --> 02:09:25,248
Sure they're the ones kidnapping those kids I mean

2699
02:09:25,504 --> 02:09:27,040
Unexplained criticizing

2700
02:09:29,856 --> 02:09:32,672
A real pistol

2701
02:09:32,928 --> 02:09:39,072
Different

2702
02:10:10,304 --> 02:10:12,096
Alex is terrible at asking questions

2703
02:10:12,352 --> 02:10:18,496
How long was it was like 40 seconds after the question

2704
02:10:18,752 --> 02:10:21,056
You going to be surprised

2705
02:10:23,104 --> 02:10:23,872
Does Raja still going

2706
02:10:24,640 --> 02:10:25,664
MN

2707
02:10:25,920 --> 02:10:27,968
Just keeps yelling you got it

2708
02:10:28,736 --> 02:10:33,600
You know I was in Washington yesterday and I got to tell you

2709
02:10:33,856 --> 02:10:37,184
Ever seen

2710
02:10:37,696 --> 02:10:40,000
Fake hysterium Moore

2711
02:10:40,256 --> 02:10:42,560
And drying about nothing

2712
02:10:42,816 --> 02:10:46,656
Let's be very clear

2713
02:10:46,912 --> 02:10:49,472
Nothing illegal and nothing wrong

2714
02:10:49,728 --> 02:10:50,752
Whydah targeted

2715
02:10:51,008 --> 02:10:57,152
Because he's the strongest and most effective spokesman for his father's campaign because you

2716
02:10:57,408 --> 02:11:03,552
Retrieve things from infowars.com and other alternative credible news sources

2717
02:11:04,064 --> 02:11:05,856
Because that's why

2718
02:11:06,112 --> 02:11:10,976
In frankly if in a middle of a presidential campaign

2719
02:11:15,328 --> 02:11:16,352
On your opponent

2720
02:11:16,864 --> 02:11:17,888
And you do not

2721
02:11:19,168 --> 02:11:20,704
To get that information

2722
02:11:20,960 --> 02:11:22,496
You're guilty of malpractice

2723
02:11:23,008 --> 02:11:29,152
This isn't this is a struggle for the presidency

2724
02:11:35,808 --> 02:11:41,952
I'm going to I'm going to cut the clip off early cuz you just got it

2725
02:11:42,208 --> 02:11:42,976
I think you just moved it

2726
02:11:43,488 --> 02:11:49,632
Directions

2727
02:11:49,888 --> 02:11:53,472
We got investigator

2728
02:11:53,728 --> 02:11:56,800
Listen I'm telling you we need to redo Nixons Alexa

2729
02:11:59,104 --> 02:12:00,896
Let's just reset America

2730
02:12:01,408 --> 02:12:07,552
Starting in the late 1500s Iago can go back and read

2731
02:12:07,808 --> 02:12:12,928
Reset everything for us

2732
02:12:14,464 --> 02:12:20,608
Too old to old age regression

2733
02:12:22,144 --> 02:12:24,704
Give him in one of those

2734
02:12:25,728 --> 02:12:26,240
Come on

2735
02:12:26,752 --> 02:12:30,080
More believable than Trump not committing

2736
02:12:31,872 --> 02:12:38,016
We are in a weird world where Project Camelot is more reasonable than Alex absolute

2737
02:12:38,272 --> 02:12:39,040
Barry Williams play

2738
02:12:39,552 --> 02:12:40,576
Carrie Callahan

2739
02:12:41,088 --> 02:12:41,600
Calm down

2740
02:12:41,856 --> 02:12:42,880
I love you calm down

2741
02:12:48,256 --> 02:12:51,072
She probably has less CD acquaintance

2742
02:12:51,328 --> 02:12:53,632
And that's taking a lot

2743
02:12:56,960 --> 02:12:58,752
Time Travelers and weirdo

2744
02:12:59,520 --> 02:13:00,544
Still more comfortable with that

2745
02:13:00,800 --> 02:13:01,312
In governor

2746
02:13:01,568 --> 02:13:02,336
Solutely anyway

2747
02:13:02,592 --> 02:13:04,640
In this next clip Rodger Stone w

2748
02:13:04,896 --> 02:13:06,944
What's the go just a little bit further than Alex

2749
02:13:07,200 --> 02:13:09,504
About trying to sort of poo poo

2750
02:13:09,760 --> 02:13:11,296
On this Russian lawyer late

2751
02:13:11,808 --> 02:13:17,952
If you look at the circumstances under which the woman lawyer go into the country

2752
02:13:24,864 --> 02:13:31,008
I think play into the the idea that you just put forward

2753
02:13:31,520 --> 02:13:32,800
Compromise

2754
02:13:33,056 --> 02:13:33,824
Trump jr.

2755
02:13:34,336 --> 02:13:38,432
Nothing whatsoever wrong

2756
02:13:38,688 --> 02:13:43,808
Strong otters House and Senate investigation

2757
02:13:44,064 --> 02:13:45,344
How come

2758
02:13:50,208 --> 02:13:50,976
So he's trying to

2759
02:13:51,232 --> 02:13:54,816
Pretend that this is it this is all they got

2760
02:13:55,328 --> 02:13:56,608
They were trying to set up an

2761
02:13:56,864 --> 02:13:57,632
Compromised

2762
02:13:57,888 --> 02:13:58,400
Junior

2763
02:13:58,656 --> 02:14:00,448
Eddie doesn't and the sentence

2764
02:14:00,960 --> 02:14:03,520
And they totally did

2765
02:14:03,776 --> 02:14:06,592
Got him to commit a crime

2766
02:14:06,848 --> 02:14:08,384
If that isn't a quick it's not

2767
02:14:12,224 --> 02:14:16,064
You're so f****** dumb dumb

2768
02:14:16,320 --> 02:14:18,368
He's the strongest

2769
02:14:18,624 --> 02:14:20,416
Most vocal supporter

2770
02:14:20,672 --> 02:14:21,696
He's a warrior

2771
02:14:22,208 --> 02:14:25,024
Constantly retweeting

2772
02:14:26,560 --> 02:14:28,352
He's a warrior and by that we mean

2773
02:14:28,608 --> 02:14:33,728
He pays tons of money to kill innocent animals in Africa

2774
02:14:33,984 --> 02:14:35,008
Also this

2775
02:14:35,264 --> 02:14:35,776
Also this

2776
02:14:36,032 --> 02:14:37,312
Premise that her visa have been

2777
02:14:37,568 --> 02:14:38,080
Expired 4

2778
02:14:38,336 --> 02:14:40,640
Six months or Obama had better in the country

2779
02:14:40,896 --> 02:14:42,176
It kind of run

2780
02:14:42,432 --> 02:14:44,224
Counter to Alex's immigration Argent

2781
02:14:45,248 --> 02:14:46,528
Just a little bit

2782
02:14:47,296 --> 02:14:48,576
Just a little again

2783
02:14:49,344 --> 02:14:50,368
I don't know

2784
02:14:50,624 --> 02:14:51,648
Dreadlock I'm not saying

2785
02:14:51,904 --> 02:14:56,768
I'm just saying also does Obama get every Visa renewal

2786
02:14:59,072 --> 02:14:59,584
That's

2787
02:15:00,608 --> 02:15:02,144
Listen Obama if you're listening

2788
02:15:02,656 --> 02:15:03,424
That was a lot of work

2789
02:15:03,936 --> 02:15:09,056
Every single legal immigrant

2790
02:15:09,312 --> 02:15:15,456
I can't stay mad at you

2791
02:15:15,712 --> 02:15:20,576
You're a woman lawyer we need you to Alex

2792
02:15:22,112 --> 02:15:22,624
That's just

2793
02:15:22,880 --> 02:15:26,208
I said lady lawyer and I apologize

2794
02:15:29,536 --> 02:15:32,096
I just don't have space my brain right now

2795
02:15:32,352 --> 02:15:33,120
That's one of those

2796
02:15:33,376 --> 02:15:33,888
Little thing

2797
02:15:35,168 --> 02:15:35,680
It's like

2798
02:15:36,192 --> 02:15:37,728
It's built into the way that we

2799
02:15:41,056 --> 02:15:41,568
Noticing

2800
02:15:42,592 --> 02:15:43,360
That's just how I talk

2801
02:15:45,664 --> 02:15:46,944
You know it's weird

2802
02:15:49,760 --> 02:15:51,552
Rodger stone is like 70

2803
02:15:54,112 --> 02:15:55,136
Car part for the course for him

2804
02:15:55,648 --> 02:15:57,696
All the stuff going to go on and Alex is going to get in

2805
02:15:57,952 --> 02:15:59,232
To his sort of

2806
02:15:59,488 --> 02:16:00,000
Oppression

2807
02:16:00,768 --> 02:16:03,328
Exactly I'm being investigated

2808
02:16:04,864 --> 02:16:05,376
Real whack

2809
02:16:05,632 --> 02:16:06,912
Violation of lawyer

2810
02:16:07,424 --> 02:16:09,472
I don't think there's anything politically wrong

2811
02:16:09,728 --> 02:16:10,496
Well

2812
02:16:11,520 --> 02:16:13,824
I don't want thing for absolute 100%

2813
02:16:15,872 --> 02:16:18,688
They came out with Federal License Commission

2814
02:16:18,944 --> 02:16:20,736
Reply to yesterday

2815
02:16:21,248 --> 02:16:22,272
And sad

2816
02:16:22,784 --> 02:16:25,344
Titan Machinery

2817
02:16:25,600 --> 02:16:26,880
Four months ago from the house

2818
02:16:31,488 --> 02:16:33,024
But I'm under

2819
02:16:33,792 --> 02:16:38,400
Counter Espionage investigation by the FBI

2820
02:16:38,656 --> 02:16:42,240
Before Congress

2821
02:16:42,496 --> 02:16:48,128
Literally

2822
02:16:48,640 --> 02:16:54,784
Know that

2823
02:16:56,064 --> 02:17:01,696
The reason I lost the election and the Russians fun me and told me what to say

2824
02:17:04,768 --> 02:17:10,144
Election

2825
02:17:10,912 --> 02:17:12,960
Going to Trump

2826
02:17:13,472 --> 02:17:19,104
It's just crazy I mean I want to be called before Congress

2827
02:17:19,360 --> 02:17:20,128
You'll get your chance

2828
02:17:22,176 --> 02:17:28,320
I just love this call before Congress

2829
02:17:28,576 --> 02:17:32,928
He'll be in contempt be the best viewing I've ever seen

2830
02:17:33,952 --> 02:17:35,232
He's on

2831
02:17:36,512 --> 02:17:37,024
Unsub

2832
02:17:37,536 --> 02:17:38,560
Audible

2833
02:17:38,816 --> 02:17:40,352
You know that went if he comes

2834
02:17:40,608 --> 02:17:42,400
Is just going to yell at you and you're going to have to LA

2835
02:17:42,656 --> 02:17:43,168
I put them in the

2836
02:17:43,680 --> 02:17:44,192
Put them in Chains

2837
02:17:48,544 --> 02:17:49,056
Seen him do that on

2838
02:17:49,312 --> 02:17:50,336
TV shows enough that it's

2839
02:17:51,104 --> 02:17:51,616
That's boring

2840
02:17:54,176 --> 02:17:55,200
Like in the Senate

2841
02:17:55,456 --> 02:17:57,248
Whatever but I also think it would be like

2842
02:17:57,760 --> 02:17:58,528
This is bad

2843
02:17:58,784 --> 02:18:03,136
Before the Senate you're making a mockery mean

2844
02:18:04,672 --> 02:18:05,696
Dude

2845
02:18:06,464 --> 02:18:06,976
Could you please

2846
02:18:13,888 --> 02:18:15,936
We called Buckley to the steakhouse

2847
02:18:17,472 --> 02:18:17,984
Buckley

2848
02:18:18,240 --> 02:18:19,008
You've been with

2849
02:18:20,544 --> 02:18:21,056
Michaela

2850
02:18:21,312 --> 02:18:21,824
How many

2851
02:18:25,152 --> 02:18:31,296
Does imagining he has a little hillbilly draw that I don't know why

2852
02:18:32,320 --> 02:18:34,112
Anyway we have one more clip left

2853
02:18:34,368 --> 02:18:36,416
Play this is

2854
02:18:37,184 --> 02:18:38,720
Kind of Rodger Stone

2855
02:18:38,976 --> 02:18:40,256
Surrendering

2856
02:18:40,512 --> 02:18:41,280
A little bit

2857
02:18:41,536 --> 02:18:43,584
I don't think you think that's what he's doing

2858
02:18:44,096 --> 02:18:45,632
But I'll let you hear what he says

2859
02:18:45,888 --> 02:18:47,680
I think it'll be pretty clear

2860
02:18:47,936 --> 02:18:49,728
Iyi this is admission of

2861
02:18:49,984 --> 02:18:50,752
Guilt

2862
02:18:55,616 --> 02:18:58,688
Why don't you put the candidates family in the line of fire

2863
02:18:58,944 --> 02:19:04,576
Send a low-level

2864
02:19:05,088 --> 02:19:11,232
Well it shows they don't have the

2865
02:19:11,488 --> 02:19:13,280
Theories of Presidential Power

2866
02:19:13,536 --> 02:19:17,888
Did the clintons have

2867
02:19:18,144 --> 02:19:24,032
Honest

2868
02:19:24,544 --> 02:19:26,336
Buddies

2869
02:19:27,360 --> 02:19:28,384
Since the beginning witch

2870
02:19:28,640 --> 02:19:29,152
What is the problem

2871
02:19:29,664 --> 02:19:30,176
This town

2872
02:19:30,432 --> 02:19:31,712
Andy should I use the cutout

2873
02:19:32,480 --> 02:19:35,040
What why would you use a cut out if you're not doing something illegal

2874
02:19:39,136 --> 02:19:39,648
Beguiled

2875
02:19:41,440 --> 02:19:43,744
Citrus bring in a movie theater standee

2876
02:19:44,768 --> 02:19:49,888
I got cut up

2877
02:19:50,144 --> 02:19:50,656
Somebody else

2878
02:19:51,936 --> 02:19:54,752
Yeah I mean with the argument that he's making the underlying argue

2879
02:19:59,104 --> 02:19:59,872
Yeah exactly

2880
02:20:02,944 --> 02:20:06,016
Do you know that you're if that's your argument

2881
02:20:06,784 --> 02:20:08,832
Something is not right

2882
02:20:09,088 --> 02:20:10,368
Which is like

2883
02:20:10,880 --> 02:20:11,648
Oud

2884
02:20:13,696 --> 02:20:15,744
Your incriminating yourself you realized

2885
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:20,608
A hundred percent

2886
02:20:25,216 --> 02:20:25,984
Is weak

2887
02:20:27,776 --> 02:20:28,288
In terms of his

2888
02:20:28,544 --> 02:20:29,824
Defense cuz all of his

2889
02:20:30,080 --> 02:20:30,592
Fall Apart

2890
02:20:31,104 --> 02:20:34,176
Anything about it being opposition research

2891
02:20:34,688 --> 02:20:35,200
Stella crime

2892
02:20:36,480 --> 02:20:38,272
He was duped by somebody

2893
02:20:38,784 --> 02:20:40,832
Still a crime still shows Criminal Intent

2894
02:20:41,344 --> 02:20:43,392
The idea that this lady is

2895
02:20:43,648 --> 02:20:46,720
Soros operative because they were pictures of on her Facebook

2896
02:20:46,976 --> 02:20:49,536
Over at the women's March is weak as hell

2897
02:20:49,792 --> 02:20:51,328
That is circumstantial

2898
02:20:51,584 --> 02:20:52,864
And if you really want to press

2899
02:20:53,120 --> 02:20:55,680
The matter all you're doing is sort of denying her

2900
02:20:55,936 --> 02:20:58,240
Her right to congregate her right to free speech

2901
02:20:58,496 --> 02:21:00,032
The right to protest

2902
02:21:00,544 --> 02:21:01,568
I think that's again

2903
02:21:01,824 --> 02:21:02,848
Your narrative Alex

2904
02:21:03,104 --> 02:21:04,384
You wouldn't want that

2905
02:21:05,152 --> 02:21:06,432
Further if you look into it

2906
02:21:07,968 --> 02:21:08,480
She

2907
02:21:08,736 --> 02:21:13,344
Is clearly the benefactor of a weird favor by the department of justice under Trump

2908
02:21:13,600 --> 02:21:16,416
That's very suspicious

2909
02:21:16,672 --> 02:21:18,976
Pick you want to talk about that Alex but I'd love to hear your

2910
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:21,280
Even their spinach

2911
02:21:21,536 --> 02:21:22,048
Incriminate

2912
02:21:22,560 --> 02:21:24,352
Everything is like

2913
02:21:27,424 --> 02:21:29,472
That's the getting closer to the center of the drain

2914
02:21:29,728 --> 02:21:31,264
Yeah that's just the water going out

2915
02:21:34,848 --> 02:21:36,128
Touching the metal map

2916
02:21:36,384 --> 02:21:37,152
What happened

2917
02:21:38,176 --> 02:21:39,200
To what happened

2918
02:21:39,456 --> 02:21:40,224
Whenever nothing

2919
02:21:42,784 --> 02:21:43,296
Opens with Alex

2920
02:21:43,552 --> 02:21:44,320
Whenever nobody's

2921
02:21:46,112 --> 02:21:46,624
To Chester

2922
02:21:47,136 --> 02:21:48,416
I don't know

2923
02:21:48,672 --> 02:21:50,208
Whenever the FBI report.

2924
02:21:50,720 --> 02:21:53,792
And it is like a all these times they did it

2925
02:21:54,048 --> 02:21:55,072
They did all this stuff

2926
02:21:55,328 --> 02:21:56,096
Trump jr.

2927
02:21:56,608 --> 02:21:58,400
We don't even need to investigate him

2928
02:21:58,656 --> 02:22:02,752
He said he pointed it out and let everybody know

2929
02:22:03,264 --> 02:22:06,848
Dave everyone evidence

2930
02:22:07,104 --> 02:22:07,616
Proven

2931
02:22:08,896 --> 02:22:10,176
Like

2932
02:22:10,432 --> 02:22:12,224
Stupid

2933
02:22:12,736 --> 02:22:13,248
None of it is

2934
02:22:13,760 --> 02:22:15,040
It's all a globalist

2935
02:22:15,296 --> 02:22:17,856
Set the groundwork

2936
02:22:18,112 --> 02:22:19,136
There is no

2937
02:22:20,160 --> 02:22:23,488
Like he is literally saying

2938
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:24,768
Can trust no

2939
02:22:25,792 --> 02:22:26,304
Anywhere

2940
02:22:27,072 --> 02:22:28,608
Except for your Sarah

2941
02:22:31,168 --> 02:22:31,680
Just your Sheriff

2942
02:22:32,704 --> 02:22:38,848
No cuz he would he would still say like no matter what let's say worst case scenario it comes out that literally

2943
02:22:39,104 --> 02:22:41,152
Trump food we're sitting down

2944
02:22:41,408 --> 02:22:42,944
There's a quid pro quo

2945
02:22:43,200 --> 02:22:44,992
About the the terms of

2946
02:22:45,504 --> 02:22:48,832
They have did all this slanderous material about Hillary Clinton

2947
02:22:49,088 --> 02:22:51,648
All this defamatory stuff send it to WikiLeaks

2948
02:22:52,160 --> 02:22:53,184
And I will lift

2949
02:22:53,952 --> 02:22:56,000
But if there is evidence that there was

2950
02:22:56,256 --> 02:22:57,536
Foreign policy sold

2951
02:22:57,792 --> 02:22:58,560
Ralph Jones

2952
02:22:58,816 --> 02:23:00,608
He's already put the

2953
02:23:00,864 --> 02:23:01,376
Jesus

2954
02:23:01,632 --> 02:23:03,168
The little building blocks

2955
02:23:04,192 --> 02:23:05,984
That is that comes out

2956
02:23:06,496 --> 02:23:07,008
Listen

2957
02:23:07,264 --> 02:23:11,104
The reason he did that is because Russia is our only potential ally against

2958
02:23:11,360 --> 02:23:11,872
The globalist

2959
02:23:12,128 --> 02:23:17,248
Ravioli country that's kick the globalist out that power

2960
02:23:17,504 --> 02:23:20,576
Then go right back to

2961
02:23:20,832 --> 02:23:22,880
Of course that would be

2962
02:23:23,136 --> 02:23:26,464
Yeah that would be a distraction that ended up happening

2963
02:23:28,512 --> 02:23:31,328
Trump is already violated the emoluments clause

2964
02:23:40,800 --> 02:23:44,896
Ever again

2965
02:23:47,200 --> 02:23:51,040
That is a hypothetical

2966
02:23:51,296 --> 02:23:52,320
It's pretty likely

2967
02:23:52,576 --> 02:23:53,600
But it hasn't been proved

2968
02:23:58,208 --> 02:23:59,232
Most corrupt

2969
02:24:02,048 --> 02:24:03,584
Thievery of

2970
02:24:04,864 --> 02:24:05,376
Government

2971
02:24:07,936 --> 02:24:12,544
This is the single largest most inexplicable coincidence that is ever happen

2972
02:24:15,616 --> 02:24:17,920
Snow White

2973
02:24:19,712 --> 02:24:20,224
Be like

2974
02:24:20,736 --> 02:24:21,248
Complete

2975
02:24:21,504 --> 02:24:22,784
Collusion invisible

2976
02:24:23,552 --> 02:24:25,344
Not really even massive conspiracy

2977
02:24:25,600 --> 02:24:27,392
Trump

2978
02:24:27,648 --> 02:24:30,208
And some really shady types

2979
02:24:30,464 --> 02:24:31,488
Or

2980
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:33,536
The the Democrats

2981
02:24:33,792 --> 02:24:35,584
Are butt hurt about losing the election

2982
02:24:36,096 --> 02:24:37,376
And they're really

2983
02:24:37,632 --> 02:24:38,144
Dead Sea

2984
02:24:38,656 --> 02:24:40,704
Narrative

2985
02:24:40,960 --> 02:24:42,496
That happens to be reinforced

2986
02:24:43,008 --> 02:24:45,568
Information

2987
02:24:46,080 --> 02:24:48,896
No they couldn't control Donald Trump Juniors response

2988
02:24:49,152 --> 02:24:49,920
Gmail

2989
02:24:54,016 --> 02:24:55,552
Is my favorite

2990
02:24:56,064 --> 02:24:56,576
Yeah it's

2991
02:24:57,088 --> 02:24:57,600
All of the

2992
02:24:57,856 --> 02:24:59,904
Lineup with their fake

2993
02:25:00,160 --> 02:25:02,208
Reality narrative that they're pushing

2994
02:25:02,464 --> 02:25:04,768
In order for that to be a plausible

2995
02:25:05,536 --> 02:25:11,680
I don't see a third option but I don't know what it is

2996
02:25:11,936 --> 02:25:12,448
Get into

2997
02:25:13,984 --> 02:25:14,496
His listeners

2998
02:25:15,264 --> 02:25:17,568
So we're talking about a lot of lawn for

2999
02:25:18,592 --> 02:25:19,360
A lot of ex-military

3000
02:25:20,128 --> 02:25:21,408
Kimmswick MO

3001
02:25:22,944 --> 02:25:23,712
What is

3002
02:25:24,224 --> 02:25:24,992
What is there

3003
02:25:26,016 --> 02:25:27,040
Like do they

3004
02:25:27,296 --> 02:25:28,832
Do they accept the rule of law

3005
02:25:29,856 --> 02:25:32,416
Narrative

3006
02:25:32,928 --> 02:25:33,696
You destroy

3007
02:25:34,208 --> 02:25:34,976
Faith in government

3008
02:25:35,488 --> 02:25:37,536
. if you say the FBI

3009
02:25:37,792 --> 02:25:38,304
Is full of s***

3010
02:25:38,816 --> 02:25:39,584
The

3011
02:25:40,864 --> 02:25:41,632
Department of Justice

3012
02:25:41,888 --> 02:25:43,680
If you go through all of these differ

3013
02:25:44,704 --> 02:25:45,728
All of this intercept

3014
02:25:47,776 --> 02:25:49,056
And you say you can't

3015
02:25:49,312 --> 02:25:49,824
Any of it

3016
02:25:50,336 --> 02:25:51,616
If you are ex-military

3017
02:25:52,384 --> 02:25:53,920
Do you say well that

3018
02:25:54,688 --> 02:25:55,200
We're innocent

3019
02:25:56,480 --> 02:25:58,016
Door is already

3020
02:25:58,528 --> 02:26:01,088
Or does that mean that it's time to honor

3021
02:26:01,600 --> 02:26:02,368
3 /

3022
02:26:03,904 --> 02:26:04,416
I hope that's

3023
02:26:08,512 --> 02:26:12,608
I ate and knowing that Alex Jones

3024
02:26:12,864 --> 02:26:13,888
Is a craven con man

3025
02:26:14,400 --> 02:26:15,424
He also

3026
02:26:15,936 --> 02:26:16,448
Love's

3027
02:26:17,472 --> 02:26:19,008
Like we know that from

3028
02:26:19,264 --> 02:26:20,800
The percentage of time he takes on his

3029
02:26:21,056 --> 02:26:22,592
Joe to sell products

3030
02:26:23,104 --> 02:26:24,896
So I would say

3031
02:26:25,152 --> 02:26:26,944
Is keenly aware that there is

3032
02:26:27,456 --> 02:26:27,968
Align

3033
02:26:28,224 --> 02:26:29,504
There's a Mendoza Line

3034
02:26:29,760 --> 02:26:32,064
Fear-mongering is going

3035
02:26:32,320 --> 02:26:33,344
To call people

3036
02:26:33,600 --> 02:26:35,136
To start fighting in the streets

3037
02:26:35,392 --> 02:26:36,928
I won't sell anymore product

3038
02:26:37,184 --> 02:26:41,280
After that point so I think he knows that there's a point he can push it

3039
02:26:41,792 --> 02:26:43,584
And once we reach that point

3040
02:26:43,840 --> 02:26:47,168
I think that will be when we can determine whether Alex Jones

3041
02:26:47,680 --> 02:26:48,960
I mean he's a con man either way

3042
02:26:49,216 --> 02:26:49,984
The weather

3043
02:26:50,240 --> 02:26:51,264
He's lost it while we can

3044
02:26:51,520 --> 02:26:53,312
Is lost it he has

3045
02:26:53,568 --> 02:26:56,384
It don't matter

3046
02:26:56,640 --> 02:26:58,432
Hugo Fugue out here with that line tells us

3047
02:26:58,944 --> 02:27:02,784
If he crosses that line to the point where it's no longer financially

3048
02:27:03,040 --> 02:27:04,064
Reasonable for him

3049
02:27:04,320 --> 02:27:06,112
To be pushing the things he's pushing

3050
02:27:06,880 --> 02:27:08,672
Then you'll know that his ideology

3051
02:27:09,184 --> 02:27:09,952
Outweighs

3052
02:27:10,208 --> 02:27:10,976
His love of money

3053
02:27:11,488 --> 02:27:12,512
I don't believe that

3054
02:27:13,536 --> 02:27:14,304
I think he loves

3055
02:27:14,560 --> 02:27:15,584
Does millions of dollars

3056
02:27:17,888 --> 02:27:19,680
I think you'll get to a point where

3057
02:27:19,936 --> 02:27:21,472
He realizes he's got to pull back

3058
02:27:23,008 --> 02:27:24,800
I don't have that

3059
02:27:25,568 --> 02:27:27,104
I think where I think we're past

3060
02:27:28,640 --> 02:27:29,152
We'll see

3061
02:27:29,664 --> 02:27:32,224
Either way we're going to die so

3062
02:27:32,480 --> 02:27:33,504
3

3063
02:27:33,760 --> 02:27:34,784
Yeah but

3064
02:27:35,040 --> 02:27:38,624
Before you die please

3065
02:27:38,880 --> 02:27:45,024
Optimistic wayfair.com

3066
02:27:45,280 --> 02:27:47,840

3069

3070
02:28:01,152 --> 02:28:02,432
It says supports

3071
02:28:02,688 --> 02:28:06,528
You can give any amount of money a month

3072
02:28:06,784 --> 02:28:08,320
Bonus stuff going

3073
02:28:09,088 --> 02:28:10,880
Some fun things to be a policy wonk

3074
02:28:11,136 --> 02:28:11,904
Everything will be great

3075
02:28:12,160 --> 02:28:12,672
Yeah

3076
02:28:12,928 --> 02:28:13,696
In the meantime

3077
02:28:13,952 --> 02:28:14,976
You know where

3078
02:28:15,232 --> 02:28:16,768
A die

3079
02:28:17,024 --> 02:28:20,352
There's one person wrong again

3080
02:28:21,888 --> 02:28:23,168
Still about you do it

3081
02:28:23,680 --> 02:28:24,704
Alright alright

3082
02:28:25,216 --> 02:28:26,496
There's a lot of people

3083
02:28:26,752 --> 02:28:29,568
The world

3084
02:28:29,824 --> 02:28:35,968
I remember the right way

3085
02:28:40,320 --> 02:28:40,832
Look

3086
02:28:41,088 --> 02:28:43,392
There's one man who's responsible for us

3087
02:28:43,904 --> 02:28:45,696
Not being able to our outro

3088
02:28:46,208 --> 02:28:47,488
His name is Jay Rappaport

3089
02:28:48,256 --> 02:28:48,768
Even f*** yourself

3090
02:28:49,024 --> 02:28:49,792
Jon rappoport

3091
02:28:50,048 --> 02:28:50,560
And I said it

3092
02:28:56,192 --> 02:29:00,032
