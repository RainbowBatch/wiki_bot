1
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:27,648
I have great respect for knowledge by knowledge I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

2
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:40,448
Need

3
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:56,064
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,088
Nike.com

5
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:05,792
I worship at the altar of Celine and talk a little bit about

6
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:09,376
Alex Jones

7
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:17,312
My bright spot today Jordan is reached the end of sneak weekend

8
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:23,712
Yeah yeah

9
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:26,784
That we had that opportunity to

10
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,344
I sat down and talked to Marquis and please and

11
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,368
I think

12
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:37,024
There's an argument that could be made that we could have put that all out on Monday or something

13
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,864
Coming so fast that we just got to keep moving

14
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:44,192
You know they're the trial the end of it the verdict

15
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:47,008
We drank that out too long we're going to end up

16
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:49,824
Still responding to a two-month from now or.

17
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,616
Generally speaking I feel like

18
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:54,944
Most of our decisions over the past 6 years

19
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,808
Could have been my argument at that they were not the right one and yet here we are so let's write it out

20
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:03,136
It's debatable that we shouldn't be doing this

21
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:09,536
That's where I'm at so I'm glad that this weekend was received well by the folks

22
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:11,584
Appreciate all the very positive comments

23
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:14,656
Other overall I mean like I just I have

24
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:21,056
I have some other fun stuff that's going on I can't really talk about right now I've seen a couple of great tweets

25
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,104
Mostly

26
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:29,504
Memes with animals in them do you know those are I can't remember any of them specifically but I remember hey that was fun

27
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:35,648
You're not going to talk about a meeting for the next

28
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:40,768
Combination

29
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:42,560
Gestalt

30
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:48,960
Is Alex might say I was coming in here thinking very similarly as to what my bright spot was that

31
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:49,728
I kind of

32
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,288
Just

33
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:57,408
A bitumen and achievements like an accomplishment but at the same time again unlock

34
00:02:57,664 --> 00:03:00,992
Yeah it's just like a

35
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,272
Yeah

36
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:04,064
And now we get to keep doing stuff

37
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:10,464
Sunday would be fun to be nice is to take a little bit

38
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,280
Trip off the beaten path to call and

39
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,328
Instead of doing some of the things that we

40
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:17,888
Time to do like Wacky Wednesday stuff for

41
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,424
I'm going to the Past

42
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,752
I thought what we would do is talk about Alex Jones

43
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:24,544
Appearing as a guest

44
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,080
Steven Crowder show

45
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:28,128
Louder with Crowder

46
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:34,528
My God so that is covering Today album

47
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:41,184
So he knows there's a billion on his head

48
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:47,584
Patrol time of the reasons I chose to do this was we see how Alex response on his show

49
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,984
It's pretty durable or it's going to be the same thing over and over again

50
00:03:54,240 --> 00:04:00,384
Be very repetitive he didn't do anything on purpose and it was

51
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,992
Will be some slight variations of interesting blow-ups and what have you

52
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:09,088
What it looks like when he's on a different platform trying to preach to a different audio

53
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,880
Are we going to get a life very fragile

54
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:15,744
Might be drunk there's no apples

55
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:22,399
So I will get down to business on this during the first let's say hello

56
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,167
Ewok

57
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,983
Very much

58
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:32,383
The ghost of ennio morricone who's tired of hearing Alex use Ecstasy of Gold from The Good the Bad and the Ugly coming

59
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,199
Automatic brakes

60
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:41,087
Thank you very much

61
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:46,719
Snapple of the Brooklyn Bridge

62
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:53,119
Show the lawyer next I am not a Russian agent Svetlana thank you so much

63
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,143
Ewok

64
00:04:54,399 --> 00:05:00,287
And even not Ava thank you so much you're now policy wonk

65
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:05,151
Achieva

66
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:09,503
I also got to take the car to the next Jordan

67
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,295
You are now a technocrat

68
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,343
I have

69
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,623
Risen above

70
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:15,903
My enemies

71
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:22,815
A little breaking for me

72
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,119
And then we're going

73
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,143
To come back

74
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:29,215
And I'm going to start the show over

75
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,335
F*** you

76
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:35,615
F*** you

77
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:36,895
I got plenty of words

78
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,431
For you but at the end of the day

79
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:40,223
F*** you and your new world order

80
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,271
And f*** the horse you rode in on

81
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,807
And all your s***

82
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,087
Maybe today

83
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,903
Maybe I'll just be gone a month baby

84
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:48,671
I'm Yours

85
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,231
Walk out of here tomorrow

86
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:52,767
And you never see me again

87
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,071
Really what I want to do

88
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:56,863
I never want to come back

89
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:58,911
Apologized

90
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:00,959
To the crew in The Westerns yesterday that I

91
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:04,031
Was legitimately having breakdowns on air

92
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,079
Better tomorrow

93
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:08,127
Please

94
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:10,943
So I never really wanted to cover Steven Crowder

95
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:11,967
And we won't

96
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:18,367
Generally but about the Connecticut

97
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,903
Haitian when he's in a new environment

98
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:26,559
A broadcaster primarily for the initiated whereas something like going on cuz hopefully roping in

99
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,839
New people for him

100
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:34,239
Of course it would be better if you could go on the road again but that doesn't seem like it's happening so crowd was going to have to do for now

101
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:38,847
I've not sat down to watch a full episode of crowder before his

102
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:45,247
Dumb show louder with Crowder

103
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:51,647
Louder with Crowder we've said the name Steven Crowder I still have no idea who he is and I refuse to find out I didn't Fury

104
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:55,999
It's me every time somebody says louder with Crowder like he's just

105
00:06:56,255 --> 00:07:02,399
He yells more than other people cuz I don't think that's true

106
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:08,799
He doesn't wear like more flamboyant outfit

107
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:11,359
Colorful loud suits

108
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,919
I don't know I don't

109
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:17,503
I think I think it's a bad name what you do

110
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,783
Is Hugo

111
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,319
Way too far with

112
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:26,719
You know you go rowdier with crowd ER you go an extra step that makes everybody really uncomfortable that's the way you do

113
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:32,095
If I had a show where I like did favors for people

114
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:38,495
Ecouter please enough reason I would be okay I'm mad that I got there but if he called this

115
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:40,799
Shows that it would make sense

116
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:42,847
Or if I tried to overthrow a government

117
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:45,919
I can't reason with reason

118
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:50,015
Again my name wouldn't work if I had a travel show could be Rome's with home

119
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:56,415
Definitely a book show tomes with all that's a good one

120
00:07:56,671 --> 00:08:02,815
Things work about the thing that they are

121
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:11,007
It's silly when it's Force what did I don't understand what louder with Crowder me regularly

122
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:17,407
A decibel level above other shows louder than him

123
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:22,015
Is one thing that immediately jumped out to me watching the show and that was at the shows very dumb

124
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,807
Like its transparently dumb

125
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:27,391
Arguments are based on false points and the humor is painful

126
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:31,999
The thing you have to realize when you watch this is that it's kind of supposed to be dumb

127
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:38,655
The audience of the show is Steven Crowder has tweeted about before it's at least

128
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:40,191
The audience is under 60

129
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,751
So this show is like sick children

130
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:46,335
And I haven't been able to confirm that figure at anyway but

131
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:50,687
He said it by him no reason to doubt it he has a Analytics

132
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:57,343
I guess you can feel like this is as bad as smoking like pushing right-wing bulshit to Children is as bad as advertised

133
00:08:57,599 --> 00:09:00,159
To be fair half of the audience

134
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:04,767
Is between 17 and 18

135
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:10,911
What are the reasons I've avoided doing too much about Crowder up till this point is that he has a lot of this content behind paywalls

136
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:17,055
Princeton's the last time Alex was on for his weird performatively masculine cigar club session

137
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:21,663
The first part of it was public but then the rest of it that you actually water watch is not

138
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:28,063
We may be coming to a point where I stop over respecting these Ding Dongs intellectual property but I'm I don't think I'm quite there yet

139
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,623
Steven Crowder is repugnant

140
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:37,023
He's a horrible person and his career has been a shameful series of horrible embarrassment that he's been able to Parlay into heaven

141
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,071
In the very successful YouTube

142
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,095
That appeals to kids

143
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:44,191
The sophomoric racist jokes and sophomoric anti-lgbtq jokes

144
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,727
I don't want to do

145
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:50,847
Too Deep dive on his trajectory but here's a summation of his a career path

146
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:55,967
You tried to be a stand-up comedian buddy sock that it's early way

147
00:09:56,479 --> 00:10:01,343
Catching the attention of Fox News when he got punched in the face by a union protester who he was harassing

148
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:08,255
This roses stature and he began making his own content most notably a segment called change my mind where you would show up at a car

149
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,023
College campus

150
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:15,423
Consider the table waiting for college students on their way to class to join him for a spirited debate

151
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:21,823
He's the meme of the guy with the shoe that

152
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,151
The college student was unprepared and probably late for class

153
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:28,991
Videos however you want it so the series was a big hit

154
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:35,647
Hey kind of falls into the same vein is Mark Davis's man-on-the-street segments where he bothers drunk people on the boardwalk and then tries to

155
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:36,927
Make a political point out of

156
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:44,095
Profile has grown Stephen has made a habit of being a pile of s*** doing half-cooked segments based on

157
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:46,399
Racist an empty lgbtq

158
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:49,215
Better easily do bunkable and not persuasive at all

159
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:52,287
Voice of adult to adults I should say

160
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:55,103
This is a very convincing

161
00:10:55,359 --> 00:11:01,503
Do a child who are naturally his Target on

162
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:07,903
What is the problem was advertised for children

163
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:08,671
Figured it out

164
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:15,071
You're dancing to show is about taking extreme right-wing views and dangerous right-wing ideologues and laundering them so they can be in

165
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,607
Enjoyed accepted by high schooler

166
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:22,751
Basically I think he's one of the worst folks in the space but also I don't know what our show can really add to that conversation

167
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:29,407
If YouTube cared at all about the safety of the children and teens who use the platform he would have been kicked off long ago and that's really

168
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:32,991
I think probably the solution here if they want to do something about it

169
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:39,391
You can't really do that much damage is he's just limited to being on Glenn Beck's Blaze Network

170
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:41,183
Nike fine yeah

171
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:45,279
Limited reach quite a bit difficult for kids

172
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,559
So weird

173
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:52,191
That's like having a Hannah Montana show where they pick them on Tana part really literally and she's a white National

174
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:54,751
She's not compound

175
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,543
Montana

176
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,871
Adhere kids a preference I'm going to transfer into Popstar

177
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:04,479
And then we're going to find out exactly how the great replacement Theory really works kids

178
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:07,551
Which is Happy song yeah I mean like

179
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:13,695
He's had Stefan molyneux he's laundering

180
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:16,511
At least multiple times

181
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:23,167
I don't have a full gas listening but you don't really need one noted hilarious white nationalist

182
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,959
Stefan molyneux

183
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:25,727
Yeah

184
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:30,847
Anyway in the aftermath of the Connecticut verdict to discuss the situation with Stephen and

185
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:31,615
Here we are

186
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:35,967
Give me some sense of a scene Steven is sitting in his Studio at a desk with

187
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:38,271
Two louder with Crowder mugs on it

188
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:43,135
He sells mugs and there's this thing called The Mug Club so this is a very important piece of the tableau

189
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:45,183
He's also wearing one of his own shirt

190
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:48,255
Because you always got to be pushing that March man always

191
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:53,375
Be selling don't wear your own shirt he's wearing over the shoulder holster

192
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:59,775
So you know that he loves guns sorry what he's wearing a holster like police chief

193
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:05,919
Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego ready in case Abdul breaks out during the show

194
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:11,039
Listen up gumshoes also there's another gun on the desk so it's it's pretty

195
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:17,439
F****** more ridiculous.

196
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:21,023
Strengthen bravado for me to take that at all seriously

197
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:27,167
Alex's on towards the end of the show but this whole episode is more less about rationalizing Alex's verdict in

198
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:31,007
Complaining about it and it's titled exclusive interview with Alex Jones

199
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:33,311
This Means War!

200
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:39,711
The temperature I wanted to start at the beginning and see the tone we're working with although you will find out that I

201
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:40,479
Did not

202
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:46,879
End up sticking to that

203
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:52,255
Listen if you say failed comedian I'm not interested that's why I don't listen to our show

204
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:54,047
So here's where we start off

205
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:57,375
I think that this is

206
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,167
Bison win today

207
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:02,239
Everything works

208
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,263
We have

209
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,055
Alex Jones Nashotah

210
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,079
And

211
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,615
Appreciate look I know

212
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,151
Manipulative

213
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,479
I was not

214
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,295
For a very long time

215
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:18,367
No no

216
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:19,903
Precise I'm here on the Shelf

217
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:20,671
Still at Chris's

218
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,279
And when we talk

219
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,559
Will be showing your mom

220
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:27,839
Montage of the endzone dance

221
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,423
Hollywood not only the elite

222
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,447
In media apathy

223
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:33,727
Government

224
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:34,751
Coming to fish

225
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,055
Championing

226
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:38,847
Real quick

227
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:45,247
This is like a clip of Jimmy Kimmel making a joke and the government officials are Jen sake tweeted something

228
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:51,903
She's not even the press secretary anymore and Alex made a big Target out of her for a while

229
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:55,231
If she received quite a bit of harassment there's Alex

230
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:58,815
It probably wouldn't be legally actionable since you the public figure ride

231
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:03,935
You know all that but yeah this is making a bit of a personal

232
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:08,799
Ricardo's where you line up

233
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,359
There's inflection

234
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:13,919
And the reason we're having our

235
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:16,991
Seeing people

236
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,039
Being bored

237
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,599
This couldn't be further from the truth

238
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:27,999
Steven loves a good bit of bullying and actually leave bullying campaign sometimes like you did in the case of Carlos Maza

239
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,303
Also Alex isn't being bullied

240
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,327
He's the bully

241
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:36,959
And Stevens the longer that reality to his audience of children so they think that Alex is the victim here I think that's

242
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:37,727
Shameful

243
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:40,799
Also Stephen saying that he has criticisms of Alex

244
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,335
And I think he's a coward

245
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:48,735
List your criticism what are they

246
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:55,135
That you like about him see how long those survive after you give him one small

247
00:15:55,391 --> 00:16:01,535
Criticism well I think that Alex would probably Dodge and stuff because he needs someone like Steven out

248
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:07,935
What's million subscribers on YouTube

249
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:13,567
Toboggan

250
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:14,591
Who is going

251
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:20,991
BFDI platform to meet for me to go on Rocket app to go start streamers

252
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:24,831
Yeah

253
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:26,879
So like

254
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:30,975
I think that he could get away with voicing some of these criticisms to Alex

255
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:33,023
Whatever they might be

256
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:37,119
Get any response that's meaningful or any resolution of these

257
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:41,471
Recognition of these criticisms

258
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,263
Barmore

259
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:48,895
Meaningful for him to express what his misgivings are and what his criticisms are valid

260
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:52,735
To the audience in a neutral environment where they could take those criticism

261
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:53,503
And then

262
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,855
Decide like huh is that something I'm actually really concerned about you

263
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:02,975
Why one of my criticisms maybe it's he lies all the time could be an issue

264
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:03,743
Well

265
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:04,511
Ha

266
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:07,071
It's one of your if one of your criticisms

267
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,375
Prior to an interview

268
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,143
Is

269
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,423
My interview subject

270
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:14,751
Is an inveterate an almost pathological liar

271
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:20,127
Perhaps you will take those answers that he gives in the interview with a different grain of salt

272
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:23,711
As opposed to if you didn't tell them that at all right now

273
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:29,855
I was I was thinking one of his legs are the criticisms of Alex might be that he barely thinks that Muslims are human

274
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:31,135
Definition but I think

275
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:34,463
Stephens audience wouldn't have as much of a problem with that

276
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:36,511
So you know

277
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:39,583
He tries to frame the interview in a particular way

278
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:45,471
And obviously it's that do that much wrong

279
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,263
Do we have some of the gala

280
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:48,799
If you watch this

281
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:51,615
Considering

282
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,175
He's been around

283
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:55,967
From what I know of

284
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:57,247
He's a good man

285
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,015
Flawed man

286
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,039
He's talking about here on it

287
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,831
A refreshing when he's on air

288
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,111
Amazon Aaron Ash

289
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,159
Maybe I drank a little too much

290
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,255
But for a man who

291
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:09,791
4 hours

292
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,119
And then

293
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:14,399
Misspeak

294
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,679
Or get something wrong

295
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,471
And then apologize

296
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:20,031
And that is punished

297
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:23,615
And the

298
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,151
People will

299
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,175
Former Prosecco

300
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:27,711
Current members of the

301
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:29,503
Quarterback

302
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:30,783
Thanks

303
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:34,879
Deciding

304
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,159
Put you in stocks

305
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,183
Newtown Square

306
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,463
The message is really low

307
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:39,999
What's crowd

308
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,047
I hope that you're hearing it

309
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:43,327
If you make them

310
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,351
Mistakes analyzer

311
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:48,447
If you have a belief

312
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,215
The other people

313
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:49,983
Pill finder

314
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,007
Offensive

315
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:56,639
Shut up

316
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,687
Any

317
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:00,735
They only get worse

318
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:01,759
What I mean that

319
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:06,623
Why is it left or right

320
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:07,647
They made it

321
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:10,975
This is tough

322
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:18,911
People watch this I guess so my God what is wrong with me why is it why am I

323
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:19,935
The weirdo here

324
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:22,495
I don't know I don't know

325
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:26,591
What he's doing here is a clear attempt to set the parameters of the conversation

326
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:32,479
It's just being taken as gospel that Alex misspoke or got some things wrong you apologize need to be punished anyway

327
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:37,599
That's what all the episode will be in response to it because of that it's going to be meaningless

328
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:41,951
If the basis in the defound ation that you're building your house on his singing

329
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:44,255
You're not going to have a good house

330
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:48,607
Not going to be a house that I'm even going to inspect because it's going to be

331
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:49,375
Going to collapse

332
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,143
Also

333
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:53,983
This stuff is already a little overdramatic

334
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:56,543
A little melodramatic on

335
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:02,943
On Crowders Park I mean

336
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,479
Okay I feel like

337
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:10,111
The stocks would have been a more effective response to Alex then what is happening right now

338
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:13,439
If we had actually been like at the very beginning like hey

339
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:15,999
You you done f***** up you misspoke

340
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:18,815
And maybe that's what happened maybe you misspoke

341
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,351
But guess what you f***** up

342
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:22,143
So you go in the stocks for a week

343
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:24,447
And then everybody hit you with tomatoes and s***

344
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,727
And then we'll see

345
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:28,031
If it's a misspeaking if you do it again

346
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:33,919
Can I request that the tomatoes be soaked in booze

347
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:39,295
Consider consider Racing for all of our stocks clients

348
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,575
So again

349
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:42,879
More more setting the table

350
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:44,671
I don't care

351
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:46,719
Don't matter

352
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:49,791
This is so

353
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:50,559
Clear

354
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,327
It's so obvious

355
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:52,863
But that's a big reason

356
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,143
But the court said

357
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,167
You cannot argue

358
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:56,447
But this is flooded

359
00:20:59,007 --> 00:20:59,519
And that was

360
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:06,943
Didn't provide additional Finance

361
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:08,735
Across-the-board

362
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:11,039
I hope that all of you understand

363
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:14,111
So it looks even made a bit of a mistake there

364
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:20,512
He says. I'm not saying that mistakes weren't made across-the-board which tells me very clearly that he understands that action.

365
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:25,376
Alexander's lawyers made during the discovery process led to the default

366
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,400
Consequences

367
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:27,936
As a principal

368
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:34,336
Right now he was just trying to hand wave that away and encourage this adolescent audience from giving any validity to peep

369
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:35,360
People who would tell them

370
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:37,152
The default was very much earned

371
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:40,480
He's basically doing PR work for 4

372
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:46,880
Ridiculous mistakes were made on both side

373
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:48,672
Mistakes were that Alex made

374
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:51,488
Because it's going to be a mountain of them it's going to be

375
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:54,560
Enough to very clearly justify

376
00:21:54,816 --> 00:22:00,960
A default yeah I mean it is you know what we talked about it with Liz just a little bit but but that

377
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:05,312
Idea of like when Alex is in the courtroom not allowed to do Alex shirt

378
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:06,848
People aren't

379
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:09,152
Convinced by Alex Chet you know

380
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:12,224
Like it's because of the priming you know like Crowder is

381
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,016
Climbing people if you just

382
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:19,136
Talk to Alex cold total

383
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:25,536
Just a basic conversation what the f*** is this guy talking to me why you bring up Hillary

384
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:29,632
Or even like these people are so young or watching

385
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:33,728
Who's Hillary what is happened

386
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:38,080
So Steve has some interesting thoughts about the idea of the bank

387
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:40,384
You are at a point in this country

388
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:41,920
Where you are paying tax

389
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:43,456
Fund

390
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:45,504
Of food

391
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,272
From the mouse

392
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,576
All under the guise of

393
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:50,112
First Amendment only protects

394
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:50,880
The governor

395
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:52,416
Stopping you

396
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,208
From us

397
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,768
Bethel

398
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:57,536
The government

399
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:01,376
But I think token

400
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:03,424
Shouldn't jpmorgan's njp

401
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,192
BJ's

402
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:04,960
What are the

403
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:05,984
These things are all these

404
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:07,008
Conglomerate

405
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:08,544
If they're back

406
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:10,336
Spell guarantee

407
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:12,384
A billions of dollars

408
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:13,920
Inflation

409
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:15,200
Hundreds of

410
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:16,480
Trillion dollars

411
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:18,528
In taxpayer dollars

412
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:20,832
Are they allowed to deny

413
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:22,880
Your fundamental Khan

414
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:23,648
Constitutional rights

415
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:25,696
What point do we set up

416
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:26,976
Business

417
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:33,632
From government even know what the point is here and I think the only way that this argument actually works is if Steven

418
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:39,776
When is advocating nationalizing the bank I know that he's not

419
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:45,920
Cuz that's some straight-up Lennon chip you f****** moron don't know if

420
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:52,320
Like the bank again I got to get government money means that they're Bound by all the rules the government entities are

421
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:59,488
If we were to nationalize the banks have to follow the same

422
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:03,328
Guidelines of vop

423
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,632
Like he doesn't get that at all

424
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:09,984
Like zero awareness of what he's actually advocating for is

425
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,336
He's such a piece of s*** he's gone through to the other side is like

426
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:16,128
See the problem with cancel culture

427
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:19,200
Is we need to nationalize the banking system

428
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,040
If you take this

429
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:28,672
Thought a little bit further you also start to understand how dumb like his version of it is

430
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,000
I guess it's that if they take tax dollars

431
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:34,304
Then they're Bound by those rules

432
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:41,216
What are people are on Social Security do they have to follow all the government's guidelines

433
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:47,616
Or what about farmers who take subsidies do you know like any like you want everybody who takes any kind of

434
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:48,640
Something from the government

435
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:51,968
To now be beholden to all the same rules cuz then

436
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,760
How do we get into a really weird play

437
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:57,344
Right right I think I think what we're seeing is what happened

438
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,648
Two people when they're allowed to speak

439
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,440
By themselves

440
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:03,488
With no disagreements

441
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,864
And they aren't capable of disagreeing with themselves do not omit from like 1 I have a thought that's that dumb

442
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:12,192
Another part of my brain will be like don't say that out loud

443
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,800
MLB like why shouldn't I say that loud it'll have a really good point I'll be like good call

444
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:26,528
He doesn't have that he doesn't have any just Talks by himself so nobody's like

445
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:28,064
Stop it that's dumb

446
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:34,464
Well the first thing that happens when you're in that kind of a predicament is you start to wear shoulder holsters

447
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,488
For no reason

448
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:38,304
Second thing that happened

449
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:44,192
Is he at you you had up still can't believe that I understand that you're describing something that has to be real

450
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:45,472
I'm seeing it as a cartoon

451
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:49,824
Okay

452
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:54,176
I don't know their names I don't remember them cuz I don't care and

453
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:57,504
Hey baby have a little bit of rap

454
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,832
You know they sit down and they they really work out some of the issues

455
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:07,232
You know they talk like you are setting me up for Disaster One trial husband

456
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,000
Oh my God no

457
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:10,048
By the way they're doing

458
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:13,120
Isn't it

459
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:13,888
Just guilty and

460
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:17,984
Let me know when we have the

461
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,592
Maybe some fat

462
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:25,152
Facts about Sutherland Springs

463
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:25,920
American history

464
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,968
Okay so I guess they just want

465
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:34,368
Death penalty which is pretty anti-government as a whole but I guess they want death metal

466
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:39,232
Also don't want to process because they just want you to be found guilty and have death penalty

467
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:41,792
Has anybody ever stopped

468
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:43,584
To think about

469
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:49,984
What these people would do if they could write the Constitution again to be a mess can you imagine what do they say

470
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,264
Government does

471
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,080
Is the first question that I have to have nothing but

472
00:26:54,336 --> 00:27:00,480
Hilliard everything and also I want them to be able to kill me but as long as I

473
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:02,272
I'm the only person who can decide

474
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:05,856
Why is that always be under pending I don't want no text

475
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:10,720
I want the government to not existed also to kill people I don't like

476
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:16,352
One of the things that I think is really funny to is it Steven realizes mid-sentence of the Las Vegas shooter is dead

477
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:20,448
For what it's worth the perpetrator the Sutherland Springs shooting is also.

478
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:26,080
There's plenty of information available about both of these events and Stephen would like to take the time to read

479
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:27,360
I would

480
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:32,480
Explain things to him if he brought up specific points I would be happy to get it to it but

481
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:35,040
He just says the names of the shooting

482
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:37,088
A man pretends there's a cover-up so

483
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,648
I got nothing I mean because we're useless show

484
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:41,696
Okay teleporter

485
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:44,512
Give it to me and I just tackle people

486
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:50,656
Whenever they say dumb s*** like I become that I don't have I'm not a superhero I don't solve problems

487
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:55,264
I will just show up immediately after Steven Crowder says something insane like that

488
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,312
Tackle him and then teleport away

489
00:27:57,568 --> 00:28:03,712
And I feel like that's a worthy Noble got arrested for assault but that away that

490
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:07,296
Trial be really interesting because I did well

491
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:08,832
Even if you did it

492
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:15,488
Write the prosecution would have to deal with the fact that you teleported

493
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:21,888
Riverview teleported away

494
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:26,240
So they are apparently doing some shows from live shows

495
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:27,520
And

496
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:31,872
There's a plug 41 at isn't it kind of lost my interest in this show is a whole

497
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:35,712
Think this feels a little bit racist

498
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:38,016
Baltimore December 3rd

499
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:39,296
We couldn't find a venue Indy

500
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,064
DC sorry

501
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:43,136
That is Baltimore but hey at least

502
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:44,160
Haiti

503
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:44,928
DC

504
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:46,464
Or DC

505
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,000
The Baltimore's worsened

506
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:49,792
It's DC without a

507
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:51,584
Well I mean

508
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:54,912
And you can go to us

509
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,192
Yikes

510
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:57,728
I don't feel good

511
00:28:58,496 --> 00:28:59,008
What

512
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:02,080
Do you think these three dudes

513
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:05,664
Associate with Haiti Baltimore and DC

514
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,456
What do you think is bear like

515
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:10,528
When they open their minds i2c

516
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:15,392
Things that they associate with Baltimore DC and Haiti

517
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:17,696
It's

518
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:22,304

Demeanor jokes there joking you're going on a comedy tour

00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:59,168
I'd love to give her by the inch

534
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,192
Baseball

535
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:01,472
Really happen with the case

536
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,032
Where it's going

537
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:11,456
Okay to steamroll him

538
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:13,760
And the second thing is awesome

539
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:15,808
Is right when he comes out the gate

540
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:16,832
Alex

541
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:23,232
Wider Steven with like at the great shirt and also establishes himself as an alpha by saying I'm going to steal your shirt

542
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:31,936
To steamroll him and Steve it has to be like hold on.

543
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:40,640
It is it is interesting the way he both tries to acknowledge that he's not going to win the steamroll comp comp

544
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:46,272
Rotation and at the same time trying to stablish dominance on his own show by saying I'm going to let you

545
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,552
Steamroll me Island

546
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:53,952
Haha well done steamrolling competition against the bullhorn

547
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:54,720
Trainer

548
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:57,280
That is Alex Jones expert

549
00:30:58,048 --> 00:31:04,192
He wants to pretend to be a host in some ways is because he knows who Alex is he knows how

550
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:04,960
We communicate

551
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:07,776
And he also knows that without guidance

552
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,824
Alex is going to say

553
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,616
Just whatever the f*** you want

554
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:13,920
And it's not going to be a useful interview her.

555
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:16,224
And he's going to do the thing that he's

556
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,808
Trying to tell people right now that he has apologized for

557
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:26,464
People that defame the you don't know if he is or not there's a danger

558
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,792
Do you want to have some guy real

559
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:32,352
Right and that's kind of what Stevens

560
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,400
Aw to leave this right now but

561
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:35,424
I think this is pivotal

562
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:36,704
And we've done several

563
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,984
Multi hour-long show

564
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:39,776
But for some reason this gets

565
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,312
And I want you to correct me if I

566
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:44,384
Sew in

567
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,152
27

568
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:47,456
As an example

569
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:48,736
Sandy Hook

570
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:50,016
You tormented

571
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:51,552
Call them out by name

572
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:52,576
You continually harassed

573
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:54,112
From what I understand I have

574
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:55,392
Confront

575
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:56,416
Misquoting

576
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:57,952
You admitted you were wrong

577
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:58,976
And you apologize

578
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:01,280
Cuz I still want to go out

579
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:02,304
2070

580
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,072
Can you talk about that

581
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:03,840
Tiffany Adam father

582
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:04,608
That you said

583
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,936
On Father's Day I want to reach out to the parent

584
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:11,008
Horrible tragedy in Newtown Connecticut

585
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,288
And give you my

586
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:13,056
Sincere

587
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,848
You said that right

588
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:19,200
Okay y'all like to reach out

589
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:20,736
To any of the parents who lost a child

590
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:22,272
Newtown to invite

591
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:23,808
Going to contact me to open a dialogue

592
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:24,832
Because I think

593
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:27,392
It's really essential we do that instead of letting the main

594
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:28,160
Mainstream media mister

595
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:30,208
Then things and really try and drive

596
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:30,976
Destination

597
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:32,000
Apart you said

598
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:34,560
Before they said

599
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:35,840
Yes before they sued

600
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:36,864
And then in 29

601
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:37,632
19 a deposition

602
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,168
And I myself

603
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,704
I've almost

604
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,728
Like a fun fact

605
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:42,752
This is my password

606
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:44,032
Thought everything was staged

607
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:45,056
Even though I

608
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:46,080
I've now learned

609
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:47,616
A lot of times

610
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:48,640
The things aren't steak

611
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:49,664
And I'm not saying

612
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:50,944
To embarrass you

613
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,504
You were clearing that you have

614
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:56,064
Change of heart or you believe that you were wrong or

615
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:56,832
You believe you made him

616
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:58,624
Admirable and I

617
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,904
Think the fact that they want to browbeat

618
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:02,464
That is what is so scary

619
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:09,120
Steven sure does seem to be ignoring the fact that and Alex's video that was titled his final statement on Sandy Hook he literally

620
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:09,888
He said quote

621
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:16,288
If children were lost in Sandy Hook my heart goes out to each and every one of those parents of the people who say they're Para

622
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:17,824
Prince that I see on the news

623
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:24,480
The only problem is I've seen a lot of soap operas and I've seen actors before and I know when I'm watching a movie and when I watch

624
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:25,248
Watching Something Real

625
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:27,808
That was in the late 2016

626
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:33,184
I want to only set the things that Stephens reading because of the Megyn Kelly interview that was about to come out

627
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:39,584
Alex has got come out around Father's Day and Neil heslin was going to be interviewed and it so he's trying to get ahead of any controversy

628
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:44,960
You do still repeating the basic conspiracy theories about the shooting at this point just holding back something

629
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:47,008
Did he thought could be legally actionable

630
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:53,920
Stevens also ignoring after this point Owen Shroyer did his video about how Neil heslin couldn't have held his son

631
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:56,224
After the shooting and Alex reported on that

632
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:01,600
Which is really does Undo any Goodwill that he might want to pretend he has from his feigned apology

633
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:08,512
Stevens also ignoring that in October 2017 Alex said quote it's as phony as a three-dollar bill with Sienna and doing

634
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:10,048
Fake newscast in blue screen

635
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:16,960
Alex is 70 think Sandy Hook probably was fake at least twice on air while the trials have been on go

636
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:19,776
Including once in the last two weeks

637
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:26,688
Google good'n'fun to create the strongman versions of What Alex actually did and the reason he's facing consequences but it's not

638
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:27,712
Real

639
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:33,344
Stephen knows it's not real but Alex's existence is pretty helpful for his brand so we pretend this

640
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:36,928
And you know the people who are watching Steven so probably

641
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:39,488
Don't have any interest in

642
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,280
Debunking this nonsense hoodies

643
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:43,072
Feeding them yeah if you

644
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:44,864
If you're going to bring up the deposition

645
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:47,680
And you're going to quote Alex from the deposition

646
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:49,984
That deposition

647
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:52,032
Convinces me

648
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:54,592
But Alex is guilty of all the things

649
00:34:54,848 --> 00:35:00,992
Well he's not quoting the deposition you quoting like an article about it probably because of something

650
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:05,344
That's a lot of media Outlets like pull out

651
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,136
Deposition

652
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:12,000
He's not actually aware of anything that I was disgusted like a position

653
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,304
Again I think

654
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,584
I can never prove this

655
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:20,960
But I think there's a vested interest in being willfully ignorant among a lot of people like

656
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:23,520
Stephen because if he had to

657
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:24,800
Cope with

658
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:25,824
Cope's the wrong word

659
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:29,664
If you had to accept publicly that he was aware

660
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:34,272
The depositions of the things that were responsible for

661
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:36,832
Rationalizing and justifying those things

662
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:38,368
And he couldn't do that

663
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:42,464
You would have to be f***** up real bad you're a piece of s***

664
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:49,632
No it is it is fascinating because these f****** piece of s*** who are trying to avoid defense

665
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:51,168
Galaxy avoid

666
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:55,264
You know waiting into having to defend Alex's actual Behavior

667
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:59,616
If they were on the jury they be like yeah this guy's got a f****** go

668
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:05,504
You know like without the ability to avoid acknowledging what is actually happening

669
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,784
Without the ability to

670
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:07,808
To deny it

671
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:12,416
When you are forced to look at directly into the eye everyday 45 f****** week

672
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:17,536
Yeah I know what he did and I think that's one of the reasons I think Bobby Barnes is such a

673
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:19,584
But assholes

674
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:24,960
He knows he was in one of the depositions that was their lawyer

675
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:27,008
Still pretending

676
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:33,408
Oh I don't understand why any of this is happening just cruising railroad tracks

677
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:37,248
There is no deniability from Barnes whatsoever because

678
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:41,856
Honestly Barnes was probably looking at that billion dollar judgment and going mad

679
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:45,440
I wish I had been a competent enough lawyer for them to hire me

680
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:51,840
So I could have sued Alex Jones her a f****** billion dollars

681
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:58,240
I wish that I could be a competent enough lawyer to have stayed Alex's lawyer to the point where I live

682
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:02,336
Is a billion dollar verdict could get so much attention

683
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:03,872
I'll be all over the place

684
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:06,432
Lighting about everything

685
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:08,992
Anyway Alex is allowed to tell his version

686
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:10,016
Of events

687
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:11,552
What do you know it's all bulshit

688
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:15,648
Information

689
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:20,768
Sandy Hook

690
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,584
The huge political event Obama has of the White House

691
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,608
Joint on I-10

692
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,520
And then about a year after it

693
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:34,336
Professor

694
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:35,104
People

695
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:36,384
Incredible

696
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:38,432
Come out.

697
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,784
Wolfgang halbig

698
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:46,624
Didn't exist

699
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,536
So I did 45 programming

700
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:55,840
2000 +

701
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:58,400
1314

702
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:00,960
Question Maybe

703
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:07,616
Google oh s*** thought it might be fake on the day of the shooting on his show

704
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:13,504
James Tracy Professor that he's talking about was first on Infowars on January 18th 2013

705
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,808
Not your later. Years later

706
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:18,880
Wolfgang halbig didn't show up until later that is fair

707
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:23,232
I need the school safety officer that I was referencing but Alex is completely ignoring

708
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:24,256
Steve pieczenik

709
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:27,072
Steve was coming on Alex's show saying no one died at the

710
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:28,352
The school on March

711
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:29,632
Within March

712
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:35,008
2013 when he was pretending to be a reporter on the scene of the DMZ

713
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:40,896
Alex's timelines all screwed up because he's just conveying his well-rehearsed self-defense version of events

714
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:47,552
Steven is a shity interviewer and he has no interest in calling Alex out so this timeline will stand to be presented to his giant

715
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:48,576
Impressionable audience

716
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:54,976
As gospel and it's just not true if you had any interest in pursuing the truth he would have familiarized himself

717
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:55,744
With these things

718
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,536
And pointed out the

719
00:38:57,792 --> 00:39:03,936
How many points at which Alex's story diverges from reality

720
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:05,216
Stop

721
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:06,496
Who helped him

722
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:09,312
Who helped him killed all those kids

723
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:11,872
Did you just say right now

724
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:18,272
That you still found time immediately that was

725
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:19,040
What is suspicion

726
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:23,392
I think you're saying in like December 2012 that's what it is that's where he's at

727
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:30,816
I'll give you the latest

728
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:37,216
Snooze and get to the latest thing

729
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:43,616
Going on what they're planning all right I feel like he just did it again but I could have I could have poor

730
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:45,664
Structure or he could

731
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:52,576
Yeah it's a little bit up in the air is I've listened to this and I'm pretty confident that this is all electric

732
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:53,600
Okay

733
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:56,672
But yeah it look is all Hillary man

734
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,208
Hillary

735
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,864
Trump's brain

736
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,168
Wild guy

737
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:08,448
Pizza pop

738
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:10,240
People support Trump

739
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:12,032
Let's make him a liability

740
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:14,336
He said out of context

741
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:16,640
And run tens of millions of TV ads

742
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:17,408
Trump

743
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:18,432
Using Alex

744
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:20,224
Spring

745
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,272
And one thing one thing just to make

746
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:23,040
Is

747
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:25,088
Again for the YouTube.

748
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:31,232
You what you were saying me

749
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:33,280
The weather forecast

750
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:37,888
Be credible and then you didn't have the money show anymore

751
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:39,424
You did say maybe

752
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,728
Just again to be clear

753
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:42,496
You after

754
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:44,032
Word said no it was not

755
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,312
I was wrong

756
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:51,968
There's a load of s*** and honestly I think if they needed to find the worst stuff Alex's said this is definitely up there

757
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:55,040
But they could have come up with a much broader campaign for Hillary to use

758
00:40:55,552 --> 00:41:01,696
Throwing some of his dehumanizing racism is violent misogyny and homophobia is incitement of violence towards Muslim

759
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:07,072
Alex is going to deep bench of horrible things Hillary could have attacked if that was the game that you was trying to play

760
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:11,936
Also Stephen knows damn well that I was didn't take that maybe the shooting was staged

761
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:15,776
Alex literally said multiple times that the shooting was totally fake with Act

762
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:22,176
Steven is softening that reality so it's easier for his audience to give Alex a pass and rationalize his actions

763
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:24,992
He's selling his audience on Alex

764
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:26,016
It's a

765
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:27,296
Concerted effort

766
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:29,856
And it's done by obscuring reality

767
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:32,416
I mean I just don't understand it

768
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:33,696
Because

769
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:40,352
There I mean it's just a bad idea I feel like the right move here if you're a piece of s*** like

770
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:41,888
Crowder one of these other guys

771
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,424
Is 2

772
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:47,520
F****** stab Alex in the back and then carve up izadi

773
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:49,568
Like I don't understand why

774
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,128
Why you're even trying this b*******

775
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:58,783
Yeah I think you don't have any loyalty to him he doesn't have any loyalty to you I think

776
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:05,183
Steven probably thinks that there is a way that this can raise his own profile maybe get some of Alex's audience

777
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:09,791
To him but a Fool's errand because Alex is audience

778
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:11,839
Like they're not going

779
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:13,119
Anybody who

780
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:19,519
Is susceptible to like maybe being interested in Crowder and listen to Alex already listen to grow

781
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:25,151
There are like Old-Timers who live in Shacks, Montana

782
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:27,967
Short right I mean not going to like your dumb

783
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:30,527
Childish comedy show

784
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:32,831
I don't know I think

785
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:37,951
I just meant as like an ecosystem you do not necessarily just crowd

786
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:44,607
Whole shabang like they're Shapiro and its backing all of them if we're smart

787
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:50,495
What he would maybe try to do is insinuate himself even more with Alex

788
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:56,639
And get involved with like the infrastructure part of banned. Video and that kind of thing

789
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:58,943
Ben and try and use it as a like

790
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:02,271
A reinforcing misinformation

791
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:04,575
YouTube

792
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:07,135
Because as it stands now there is

793
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:07,903
A

794
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:09,951
Shallow depth

795
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:16,351
Of anything interesting on their there's plenty of content and there's a load of b*******

796
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:19,423
Steven is like I don't think

797
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:22,495
It's in his best interest necessarily to be hooked with

798
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:23,263
Glenn Beck

799
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:26,847
With the blaze stuff but maybe there's some good money there

800
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:29,663
But in terms of like if you want some of Alex's audien

801
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:30,431
Internet stuff

802
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:32,479
He wants to create like more of a

803
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:38,111
Space would be the thing you do some of the other weirdos

804
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:44,511
But actually hold on

805
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:48,863
Miller Place in three years that we are right now and I don't think that's even close to pause

806
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:51,679
But I guess I maybe

807
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:58,079
Don't agree with myself either cuz censored.tv around

808
00:43:58,335 --> 00:43:59,359
Not a lot going on there

809
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:05,759
Maybe nevermind I was going to say he could go to like try and help build up cozy Nick Fuentes a servicemen

810
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:08,831
It doesn't work.

811
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:09,855
What's this

812
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:12,671
Yeah definitely

813
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:15,743
Yeah I don't know

814
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:20,863
It's it can't can't help it

815
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:25,983
I think it's all stupid but Alex just as an out-and-out liar

816
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:30,591
So show it

817
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:34,943
420 15 + 20

818
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:36,479
16-week check the record

819
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:38,527
I never talked about it one time

820
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:40,831
This is a car baby it's

821
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:42,623
Shut up I don't want

822
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:44,159
I think about that

823
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:45,951
Some of the folks

824
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:48,255
Even crazier

825
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:50,303
Just regulate

826
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:51,327
Ensure

827
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:52,863
Indeed

828
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:56,703
I didn't put me on the map

829
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:57,727
I barely ever covered it

830
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:58,751
Hillary

831
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:00,031
Blows it up

832
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:01,567
Cause celeb for dinner

833
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:04,895
Bring back all the gun control and now attached

834
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:05,919
Free speech

835
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:07,199
Trump

836
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:10,783
Crazier

837
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:18,719
His own elaborate plot Hillary launch to attack Trump and then Trump want it seems like it really wouldn't do anything to get

838
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:19,743
Continue attacking Alex

839
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:24,095
The gold would have been to use Alex's toxicity to sway the electorate away from

840
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:27,679
Contraband wants Trump has one that's about it in terms of Voters

841
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:29,215
Doesn't make sense

842
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:35,615
Unless you're just desperate to defend yourself using bulshit fantasy-world nonsense

843
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:41,759
Stop talking about Sandy Hook

844
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:46,879
26th 2015 squarely in the window he's claiming you never brought it up

845
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:48,671
In my opinion something really

846
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:50,463
Thanks about this entire situation

847
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:51,743
I don't

848
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,279
I can't even really

849
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:56,863
Think of a mass shooting quote-unquote or a hype

850
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:58,143
Dial shooting like this

851
00:45:58,655 --> 00:45:59,167
That didn't

852
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:01,983
Seemed like there was something more going on

853
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:13,503
I was rfkr the situation

854
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:14,783
We caught them

855
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:21,439
It just isn't real

856
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:24,255
I don't know what specifically happened

857
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:26,815
But the official story is a fairy tale

858
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:30,911
Stock isn't real

859
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:32,703
And that is a giant

860
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:36,031
Theater operation complete with blue screens

861
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:40,127
And now even Rob who's Uncle

862
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:44,991
Retired FBI works for big company

863
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:48,063
We have a reporter up there

864
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:56,255
Covering something up

865
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:04,447
Is a reporter there that there was dampened by the way

866
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:10,847
Go fuc yourself Alex stop talking to the people who promoted the crisis actors s***

867
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:11,615
Steve

868
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:17,759
Was a guest until he and Alex got into a fight about Steve pushing qanon s*** during the aftermath of the 2020 election

869
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:24,415
How much is a liar and these are easily demonstrable lies if Steven cared at all to protect his audience from afro

870
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:26,975
You have a responsibility to them

871
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:29,279
Lili neglecting that which is shameful

872
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:33,119
I'm here so here's what I actually think about your talk about like

873
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:35,679
You know why not just carve up Alex's audien

874
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:40,543
I think that for someone like Steven there's probably an interest in preserving Alex if you can

875
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:43,615
Suge Knight is because he is worse than you

876
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:48,735
Presumably he's worse than you if only because like you're still on YouTube

877
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:50,783
Right

878
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:52,831
So as long as Alex's there

879
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:56,671
The lot of people will think there's a bigger issue than Steven Crowder

880
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:58,207
Still in the same way that

881
00:47:58,463 --> 00:48:00,511
You you hear people even Tucker say like

882
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:07,167
Little bikes great replacement Theory isn't crazy thought Alex Jones s*** exist as

883
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:13,567
I'm not him example

884
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:14,335
They're broken shield

885
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:15,359
Yeah

886
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:17,919
Yeah I think that's probably a way to look at it

887
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:20,735
So Alex Azar

888
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:23,551
Piazza

889
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:25,343
Steve's going to let him say it

890
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:27,903
Dozens of Correction

891
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:29,695
Apologies

892
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:30,719
One of them there

893
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:32,255
Then they sue me

894
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:33,535
In 2008

895
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:34,303
A-Team

896
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:38,143
Discovery we give them all the emails all the time

897
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:42,495
Premeditated

898
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:43,775
Got it wrong on purpose

899
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:45,567
And so both Democrat

900
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:47,103
Connected judges

901
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:50,431
Republican George W bush

902
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:52,479
They default me

903
00:48:57,087 --> 00:48:57,855
Milazzo Alex

904
00:48:58,111 --> 00:49:00,159
For a second

905
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:03,231
Globalist

906
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:06,815
Not allowed

907
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:10,655
To defend myself

908
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:11,935
The judge actually says

909
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:14,239
You can't sell your back rub

910
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:15,519
Got all that

911
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:18,591
But

912
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:21,407
There is no pushback there's no

913
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:24,735
Discussion of what these things are there's no reason to

914
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:29,343
Sokai Crowder wants to know like real seriously

915
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,391
Did you use these peoples names

916
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:33,951
Did you ever call the parents out by name on air

917
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:34,975
They were

918
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:35,999
Their children

919
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:36,767
Call them out

920
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:40,095
Only Robbie Parker

921
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:42,143
And

922
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:44,447
Afterbirth

923
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:46,239
That that he staged

924
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:48,031
This club

925
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:51,359
Viral clip

926
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:52,383
People say this guy

927
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:53,407
Looks fake

928
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:56,991
And so I said yeah it doesn't like acting to me but he's

929
00:49:58,271 --> 00:50:00,319
That's not true and

930
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:04,927
Hair salons name was said on Infowars Posner

931
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:11,327
And also intentional infliction of emotional distress doesn't require you say people's names

932
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:15,167
Constantly screaming about how some people should die

933
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:17,727
Because they changed their pronouns

934
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:23,359
And yet somehow they're going to try and pretends that pronouns cannot refer to people

935
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:26,943
Right you have to say their name like a magic

936
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:29,247
Spell you have to sew it in

937
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:30,527
To your f******

938
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:36,927
Piece of paper with Silver Thread Dan obviously otherwise it's not defamation and when you say you like the same

939
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:43,327
Please if you're one of the members of one of the families you can't consider yourself part of that group

940
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:46,655
That's how words were no damn

941
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:47,935
So Alex

942
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:50,751
Tries to explain it really wants to explain that

943
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:53,311
Because it's kind of important

944
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:54,847
Fully complied with discovery

945
00:50:57,663 --> 00:50:59,199
People will say we're the reason you were lying

946
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:00,479
It was a default

947
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:02,783
You didn't provide

948
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:03,551
The evidence

949
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:06,879
Give me pray specific not just

950
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:08,159
You did

951
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:09,695
Provide in Handover lot of

952
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:10,719
What did you end up with

953
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:11,487
Because I did have fun

954
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:14,815
I certainly the text

955
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:20,959
When I was watching the trial a would say well a

956
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:23,263
Actually they didn't hand over for example

957
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:24,287
Call the Alexa report

958
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:25,567
Supposed to Google

959
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:26,591
What

960
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:27,615
Kind of evidence

961
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:29,663
Just give me some examples of

962
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:30,431
But you did Handover

963
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:31,711
Did you hand over Financial.

964
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:32,479
Related

965
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:35,551
Did you hand over doctor

966
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:36,575
Related to

967
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:38,623
Traffic

968
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:39,647
And revenues

969
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:40,671
To some degree

970
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:45,791
Achoo an extreme degree the most ever given over in a civil defamation

971
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:46,815
Albany lawyers

972
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:50,143
Provide is my

973

Accurate information

974
00:51:55,007 --> 00:51:55,775
I'm just saying this because

975
00:51:56,287 --> 00:51:56,799
People try

976
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:58,847
On the right will say when you get sushi

977
00:51:59,103 --> 00:51:59,615
She complied rings

978
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:00,383
Discovery

979
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:01,151
What

980
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:02,943
What

981
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:03,967
In the fuc

982
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:05,247
Are they closing

983
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:06,783
You didn't provide

984
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:08,063
So that you are not allowed

985
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:08,831
How to defend yourself

986
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:12,415
Let me answer that question and then I want to get into people

987
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:20,607
They claimed

988
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:21,375
That

989
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:23,423
Because we did so much

990
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:24,191
Discovery

991
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:27,263
Person they were

992
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:28,543
Deposing give them orders

993
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:32,895
So they say all out of the 200,000 emails you Davidson

994
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:36,223
And what is Discovery match

995
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:40,319
Little weird gacha

996
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:50,303
Give me the Google Analytics

997
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:53,375
Ma'am

998
00:52:54,399 --> 00:52:55,167
Search box

999
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:56,447
For the back end of Google

1000
00:52:57,727 --> 00:52:59,007
We never paid for it

1001
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:01,311
We barely ever used it we start for Google Analytics

1002
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:02,847
One Rider

1003
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:05,407
And one other person in the in the group that had

1004
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:10,783
Give them what we had in our

1005
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:12,831
About Google Analytics

1006
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:14,879
Kegel exercise

1007
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:20,255
I want you to give me the Google

1008
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:24,607
You say okay what do you want me to search in Google

1009
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:25,375
No

1010
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:28,191
Give me the Google

1011
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:29,471
Give me the Google

1012
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:32,287
Some of those

1013
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:33,311
Instances of

1014
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:37,407
Google analytics over they go get my traffic we're getting from this Sandy Hook

1015
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:41,247
Article

1016
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:47,903
It's even really wanted to be prepared to ask this question and respond appropriately to Alex's answer he should have read the order for the day

1017
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:48,671
Default judgment

1018
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:50,207
It spells everything out

1019
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:53,791
There were request for production that Alex and never even responded

1020
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:54,815
To their request

1021
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:57,375
Stupidest people for depositions that were ignored

1022
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:58,143
Alex

1023
00:53:58,399 --> 00:53:59,167
Peterlee cycle

1024
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:03,007
Completely unprepared people to deposition does corporate Representatives

1025
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:04,287
That's just the surface

1026
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:10,687
How much do turnover big batches of documents but he had a habit of doing that just before hearings about his face

1027
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:11,967
Turn over documents

1028
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:16,831
So we can avoid consequences wow overwhelming the plaintiff's with tons of unrelated s***

1029
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:20,415
Even these tranches weren't satisfactory to what he was obligated

1030
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:22,719
Did the turnover though and it didn't really help

1031
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:30,399
In the Judgment that you discuss how they tried to resolve the problem through fines and sanctioned but it was clear that had no effect on

1032
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:32,191
Abuse of the discovery process

1033
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:37,055
He has too much money to be impacted by whatever find the court could impose so it was a dead end

1034
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:39,103
Stephen doesn't care about the reality

1035
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:40,127
Euro the truth

1036
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:46,783
He's just asking questions to allow Alex to give his boilerplate rehearsed answer and make it look like Steven was asking tough questions

1037
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:48,319
This is a charade

1038
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:54,719
That is match to exonerate Alex and Eliza Stephens audience

1039
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:55,743
Hard because

1040
00:54:55,999 --> 00:54:56,767
The real

1041
00:54:57,023 --> 00:54:59,071
The truth of it is like that

1042
00:54:59,327 --> 00:55:02,911
All the hymn be like I'm not allowed to say I'm innocent I'm not allowed to say I'm all this stuff

1043
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:03,935
And it's like

1044
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:05,215
That's your fault

1045
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:09,567
And the reason that you weren't allowed to say it is because if you did

1046
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:12,639
Sooner or later you would have to go to jail

1047
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:14,687
We're being nice to you

1048
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:15,967
By keeping you

1049
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:19,551
This is this is like you going bowling with rails

1050
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:21,087
That's the point here

1051
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:27,487
It's cuz you are going to be a gutter ball and then go to jail we're saving your life man

1052
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:29,279
You had practice bowling

1053
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:32,607
But in this matter for you at Whitney's arrest

1054
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:36,191
Exactly

1055
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:39,775
Stephen this is lost control of the shuttles

1056
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:42,079
Completely taken over

1057
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:57,183
I was just saying I don't think that though

1058
00:55:57,439 --> 00:55:57,951
You know

1059
00:55:58,207 --> 00:55:58,975
What is closed

1060
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:02,815
This is the album

1061
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:05,375
Next Level garbage

1062
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:11,007
Texas Secretary of State Alex Jones Unleashed

1063
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:12,799
Hell on our election

1064
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:16,127
Here's another one

1065
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:18,943
Bubble Blast nuts

1066
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:21,759
Resume

1067
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:23,807
Killing everybody

1068
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:30,207
Alex is just doing his show I'm waiting for him to do and he's calling for overhead

1069
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:36,607
This is ridiculous

1070
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:40,447
Alex Jones Show

1071
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:41,727
That is so funny

1072
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:43,263
Also we got these coins

1073
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:49,407
No longer a fundraiser

1074
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:52,223
So Alex believes that this is overkill

1075
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:57,343
I meant Steven has some harsh words for the so-called Brave conservative

1076
00:56:58,111 --> 00:56:59,647
Overkill

1077
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:01,183
Having a temper tantrum

1078
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:02,975
They want to scare everybody else too

1079
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:04,511
Lawyers to file lawsuit

1080
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:08,351
I really

1081
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:11,423
It's so frustrating to be kind of

1082
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:12,959
Only have my show that's

1083
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:14,495
Department

1084
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:16,799
It's very hard actually

1085
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:18,847
Alex

1086
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:20,383
Bishop is cowardice

1087
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:22,175
You at your your night

1088
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:23,455
Stations Odyssey off

1089
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:26,015
Yeah I would say I wouldn't say

1090
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:30,623
Remember I told you I'm a lie on the shows

1091
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:31,647
I don't like that

1092
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:32,927
You sometimes throw up in fighting

1093
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:35,231
Remember you saying you know what I used to do that more

1094
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:37,279
And I decided the left is more important

1095
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:38,303
Strongest

1096
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:40,863
Compelled to have you on because

1097
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:42,399
Some of the biggest figures in our movement

1098
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:43,423
By the way

1099
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:44,703
Agreed with all of

1100
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:45,727
Some of your corner

1101
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:47,519
Cuz I thought were incorrect

1102
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:48,799
They didn't have

1103
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:50,079
It is Santa

1104
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:51,615
Cowardice

1105
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:55,967
Let me translate what Steven saying they're about the infighting among conservatives

1106
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:58,015
Alex I work for Glenn Beck

1107
00:57:58,783 --> 00:58:02,879
Stop being also Steven you have to understand

1108
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:08,767
A lot of those other conservative Outlets are really busy running damage control for Tucker's Kanye West interview at the moment

1109
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:13,887
A lot of them just don't have the juice to throw Alex into the mix and try and deal with that both

1110
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:16,447
Protecting against the Ravens

1111
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:22,847
Anti-Semitism in our party and protecting against Alex's

1112
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:23,871
And more

1113
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:26,431
It is weird

1114
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:31,807
I wonder if Joe watch some of the trial and realize that Alex lied to his face about what he said about Sandy Hook

1115
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:38,463
That'll be fun if I like Joe started to get the picture that Alex is using him and see what develops from there

1116
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:42,303
I'm not optimistic that's going to happen

1117
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:46,655
The trial it would be really hard to come away from it

1118
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:49,727
Thinking that Alex did not lie to your f******

1119
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:55,615
Yeah but you still got to realize he's a fun guy really funny

1120
00:58:55,871 --> 00:59:00,991
Do you know what this reminds me of this reminds me so much of walking into a Dunkin Donuts

1121
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:03,551
In like f******

1122
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:06,879
They are around

1123
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:07,647
Whatever

1124
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:14,047
And there's two old guys sitting in that way right inside the door so you can see him through the window

1125
00:59:14,303 --> 00:59:15,839
And they're arguing about a parking

1126
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:17,119
Ticket and he's like

1127
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:17,887
Man

1128
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:24,287
I didn't park there I'm telling you and you know the guy's lying I'm walking in there trying to buy coffee for Tuesday

1129
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:26,079
Second I want to turn around be like dude

1130
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:30,431
Just pay the parking ticket you're a f****** liar obviously you

1131
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:34,527
And the other guys like yeah you're totally right man they shouldn't be able to do that

1132
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:36,575
One of those guys is Rogan

1133
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:37,599
Okay

1134
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:40,927
Just making sure no I think I'm talking about Crowder and Alex right now

1135
00:59:41,439 --> 00:59:42,719
Okay who's Rogan

1136
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:45,535
Izzy the donut Rogan would be a delicious donut

1137
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:52,191
So we got a question for Alex

1138
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:57,823
If we got to find out if he's scared

1139
00:59:58,335 --> 00:59:58,847
Let me ask you

1140
00:59:59,615 --> 01:00:00,383
Really

1141
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:02,175
Anytime

1142
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:08,831
I am way more scared about the direction

1143
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:10,367
Countries going into

1144
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:11,135
The formula

1145
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:13,183
Everybody I mean

1146
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:17,791
We're coming

1147
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:19,839
Everybody now with this model

1148
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:22,143
I'm not even got the Republican Secretary of State

1149
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:23,679
In Texas

1150
01:00:25,215 --> 01:00:25,727
Republicans

1151
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:28,287
Give me a break

1152
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:29,823
The rhinos neocon

1153
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:31,871
The rabbit left Allied together

1154
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:33,151
The populist

1155
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:33,919
Rising

1156
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:35,199
Nationalist America

1157
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:36,735
Score peacefully crying

1158
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:39,807
Concerned about nuclear war

1159
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:40,575
I'm way more

1160
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:47,231
Hawaiian places going to wait accelerate store

1161
01:00:47,999 --> 01:00:49,535
Walmart Republicans and Bob way

10 years

1163
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:54,399
Is there such a place in a billion dollars will be like

1164
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:55,167
$1,000

1165
01:00:55,423 --> 01:00:58,495
Current rate

1166
01:00:59,775 --> 01:01:00,543
No I'm not scared

1167
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:02,079
I am

1168
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:03,359
Disgusted

1169
01:01:04,383 --> 01:01:05,663
Proud of myself

1170
01:01:08,223 --> 01:01:08,991
Tasha but I was wrong

1171
01:01:12,575 --> 01:01:13,343
The strawman

1172
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:15,647
They sat there and had a lot of

1173
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:16,927
Suppress the truth

1174
01:01:17,183 --> 01:01:18,207
Tell him I was guilty

1175
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:19,487
Where does kangaroo court

1176
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:20,511
Try myself.

1177
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:22,303
Call

1178
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:24,351
Children

1179
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:25,631
The country in the future

1180
01:01:26,143 --> 01:01:26,911
Because of the rabbit

1181
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:27,679
Acceleration

1182
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:29,215
Total and complete corruption

1183
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:30,239
Wow that's

1184
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:33,055
That's quite a answer to are you scared

1185
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:35,871
I don't know if yes

1186
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:37,407
I feel like from

1187
01:01:37,663 --> 01:01:40,479
Numbers that I was seeing the inflation started

1188
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:41,247
To turn around

1189
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:46,623
And I don't know if we're going to end up in a Weimar Germany situation

1190
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:50,975
We're not going to go Zimbabwe baby

1191
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:57,631
I mean if I read everything correctly I feel like there's a difference between like radical out of

1192
01:01:57,887 --> 01:02:04,031
Control inflation and all of these businesses being like who they're talking about inflation we can charge an extra two bucks

1193
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:10,175
Get some of this is a little bit hard to disaggregate from each other some of these forces

1194
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:11,711
But yeah I don't I don't think that's

1195
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:18,111
The path we're heading on and also I think that nuclear war was supposed to have already started by now based on Alex's project

1196
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:21,439
So I guess

1197
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:28,351
You should probably be more concerned about his own personal matters they fixing pretty severe

1198
01:02:28,607 --> 01:02:30,655
Is it still going to be an albatross over your neck buddy

1199
01:02:30,911 --> 01:02:32,703
What are the co-hosts

1200
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:35,007
Ask that was a very important question that is

1201
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:38,591
What's up with the appeal how is that going to work right

1202
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:41,919
I am you'll notice over the course of the maybe next

1203
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:43,711
Three Clips Alex

1204
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:45,247

Yasso

1206
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:47,551
You said earlier that

1207
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:49,343
And why do you think

1208
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:50,367
It will be over time

1209
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:52,159
This faith in the

1210
01:02:57,279 --> 01:02:58,815
Excellent question

1211
01:02:59,327 --> 01:03:00,863
I have talked to dozens

1212
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:02,399
Very well-known

1213
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:03,423
Lawyers

Federal and state

1218

This is the most

1219
01:03:14,943 --> 01:03:15,967
Insane craziness

1220
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:17,247
They've ever seen

1221
01:03:17,503 --> 01:03:23,647
Alright so your lawyer who lost this case for you is talking to other people alleged

01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:28,511
That this s*** is crazy

1224
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:30,047
How you're going to win the appeal

1225
01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:30,815
Okay

1226
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:32,351
So there's no ground

1227
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:38,751
Forgiven for what the appeal with the argument is why they Merit and appeal other than a come on

1228
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:43,615
Yeah that's fine

1229
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:48,735
Alex like legit seems to believe that he can just pay for the appeal he will magically win

1230
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:51,551
America's gone and completely done

1231

01:03:58,207 --> 01:03:59,487
Because they are so scared

1235
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:00,767
But if there's any jokes

Will be overturned

Do is also definitely run by the Chinese billionaires

1253
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:53,503
Yeah this is fun I mean it's just Alex trying to be like

1254
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:59,903
Yeah you should still give me money cuz I'm going to find a way to launder it during the appeals process

1255
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:00,671
Problem is

1256
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:03,231
The problem is for Alex is that

1257
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:10,143
In a very real way this is an apolitical case for the loss of her lawyers

1258
01:05:10,399 --> 01:05:14,239
Judges and everything because they all have a vested interest in this being at least

1259
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:15,007
The bottom

1260
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:18,079
You know like all of them would prefer to have

1261
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:19,615
From guardrails

1262
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:21,663
So we don't have to go through like another

1263
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:24,991
This judges waited three years to default judgment because

1264
01:05:25,247 --> 01:05:30,879
We just have never seen this s*** before so it helps if we have a baseline here of like

1265
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:31,647
Guess what

1266
01:05:31,903 --> 01:05:35,487
Here's a person who's done this s*** before here's what we've done before

1267
01:05:35,743 --> 01:05:38,303
And now we don't have to do this again you know overnight

1268
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:42,143
Yeah this is Alex's

1269
01:05:42,399 --> 01:05:45,983
Sort of path and is much as like Trump taught us so much about how

1270
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:52,639
Much of the government is not codified how much of it is based on just like we all agree this is how humans behave

1271
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:59,039
It's a good idea to do this right yeah Norms that we've protected us and kept things in

1272
01:05:59,295 --> 01:06:05,439
They aren't really real Alex's kind of revealing some of the similar stuff with the legal system

1273
01:06:05,951 --> 01:06:09,279
You could just not do stuff is unfortunate that it's like

1274
01:06:09,535 --> 01:06:15,679
Oh man we've accidentally created a system geared towards giving narcissistic psychopath

1275
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:17,471
Lot of money and power

1276
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:23,103
If they have the nerve and the shamelessness whatever the f*** I want to know

1277
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:29,247
So I was continues to ramble about his not answer about how this feels going to work and then he forgets what

1278
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:30,015
Question whose answer

1279
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:31,807
But I know that

1280
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:33,343
Okay they got their pound of Flesh

1281
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:35,135
They brought back

1282
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:35,903
Look up Sandy Hook

1283
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:37,439
They made a bunch of money for their charity

1284
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:41,791
Yeah those bad people made of butterflies

1285
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:45,631
And now nobody knows who killed the kids

1286
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:47,679
So

1287
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:51,775
I think you answered the question

1288
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:54,591
Why do you believe it will be overturned

1289
01:06:58,175 --> 01:06:58,687
Constitutional law

1290
01:06:59,199 --> 01:06:59,711
Bottled water

1291
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:02,527
Absolutely

1292
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:04,575
They have to

1293
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:11,743
This is never before been done

1294
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:21,215
Fun the way that Stevens interview-style seems to be like Alex's just rambling

1295
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:23,519
I'll try not to this question for him

1296
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:28,127
See if he can just say yes to my suggested answer and Alex does

1297
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:32,223
I meant starts rambling some more it is it is fun that if you are

1298
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:37,087
Steven Crowder you know you started the show by being like you weren't even allowed to make your defense

1299
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:40,159
And then at the end of the show you have to be like oh no that

1300
01:07:40,671 --> 01:07:42,463
You shouldn't you should have been

1301
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:48,863
Your defense is terrible and you're just not going to be able to answer yes or no question to save your life

1302
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:51,423
F****** literally to save your life

1303
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:53,215
You're f****** defenses Hillary

1304
01:07:53,983 --> 01:07:54,495
Go away

1305
01:07:56,031 --> 01:08:02,175
So Alex starts rambling about money and gets into his divorce for some reason it is weird

1306
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:06,527
Are gross

1307
01:08:06,783 --> 01:08:08,063
What's 61 million

1308
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:08,831
Dollars

1309
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:09,855
I paid myself

1310
01:08:10,111 --> 01:08:10,879
200

1311
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:11,647
Thousand

1312
01:08:11,903 --> 01:08:12,927
Dollars last year

1313
01:08:13,183 --> 01:08:13,951
It's all in the bankruptcy

1314
01:08:16,255 --> 01:08:17,535
Was there a year

1315
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:20,095
Myself 12 million dollars

1316
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:21,887
Absolutely the year

1317
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:23,679
Of the divorce with my ex-wife

1318
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:24,959
6 years ago

1319
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:26,751
Thank God it was the Trump bear

1320
01:08:27,007 --> 01:08:28,799
All this extra money

1321
01:08:29,055 --> 01:08:29,823
What was she divorced

1322
01:08:30,847 --> 01:08:31,871
He goes to the process

1323
01:08:32,383 --> 01:08:33,663
The court made me pay her clothes to

1324
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:36,991
Million dollars to buy her out of the company

1325
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:38,783
For 13 years

1326
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:41,599
Show the 11 year

1327
01:08:41,855 --> 01:08:45,439
About a million 2 million dollars a year

1328
01:08:45,695 --> 01:08:47,743
All the bills and stuff and legal crap

1329
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:54,143
He had a

1330
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:59,519
500% 400 % pay increase

1331
01:09:00,543 --> 01:09:01,055
Okay that makes sense

1332
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:02,335
So weird

1333
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:04,639
The 1-year I make $1000000

1334
01:09:05,663 --> 01:09:07,711
God takes room magically the money came in

1335
01:09:07,967 --> 01:09:09,759
By my ex-wife I'll accompany

1336
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:11,039
So

1337
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:16,671
I see you at

1338
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:18,975
And we all struggle with this right

1339
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:23,327
And it's sad

1340
01:09:25,887 --> 01:09:26,399
But you absolutely

1341
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:27,167
Deserve to earn

1342
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:28,959
You have millions

1343
01:09:29,215 --> 01:09:29,983
People who are listening in the amount of

1344
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:32,543
What I do here as well

1345
01:09:33,055 --> 01:09:34,079
Conservatives are the only ones

1346
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:34,847
Surprise me

1347
01:09:35,103 --> 01:09:35,615
People support free enterprise

1348
01:09:36,127 --> 01:09:36,639
We feel like

1349
01:09:36,895 --> 01:09:37,407
Because our audience

1350
01:09:38,943 --> 01:09:40,223
Don't get mad at me because

1351
01:09:40,991 --> 01:09:41,503
I make this money

1352
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:42,271
Because it's you

1353
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:43,295
One you're making

1354
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:44,063
12 million

1355
01:09:44,831 --> 01:09:46,367
A several hundred million dollar judgment

1356
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:47,903
You know who makes 12 a.m.

1357
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:48,671
Every single year

1358
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:51,487
No one cares

1359
01:09:51,743 --> 01:09:54,559
Explain that Dynamic little better than Steven

1360
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:59,167
You know Alex do this song and dance because they know that they're f****** over their audience

1361
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:05,823
They have to rationalize the money they make because it's an insane amount and they earn it by exploiting their audiences fear and anger

1362
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:09,407
And monetizing that while putting vulnerable People In Harm's Way

1363
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:10,943
And they do

1364
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:12,991
No work and they sell

1365
01:10:13,247 --> 01:10:13,759
Garbage

1366
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:15,039
Absolutely

1367
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:21,439
Garbage didn't know preparation for this interview he has no idea the subject that he's even covering

1368
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:24,767
There's no work that goes into this other than ripping dumb jokes

1369
01:10:25,023 --> 01:10:31,167
They know that they don't do s*** whether it's conscious or not if that's another question about whether or not that's why they have two rash

1370
01:10:31,423 --> 01:10:37,311
Nationalize this

1371
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:40,127
And then before you know it there's a racist QVC

1372
01:10:40,895 --> 01:10:47,039
Fallon and Colbert make money but I am not sure how much but they don't get on their show every night and try to rationalize it because

1373
01:10:47,295 --> 01:10:48,319
Cuz we actually put on a show

1374
01:10:48,831 --> 01:10:52,671
They're entertainers doing a job not just complaining about how they're so persecuted

1375
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:55,487
And this has nothing to do with political alignment

1376
01:10:55,743 --> 01:11:01,887
Do you think Jeff Foxworthy or Larry the Cable Guy or Ron White has to rationalize that they make millions of dollars

1377
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:03,423
They don't because they're

1378
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:06,239
Pallet makes it obvious why they make that much money

1379
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:11,103
A con man like Alex and Steven it's different and that's why they do have to do this like

1380
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:15,711
Oh hey look it's a hundred million dollars that I make metallic snowbigdeal.

1381
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:19,807
Now there seems have a justify why thievery is okay

1382
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:25,183
Steven doing like certainly legal fees legal to use

1383
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:30,303
I mean I understand you have to explain why you have to rationalize their life

1384
01:11:30,559 --> 01:11:32,095
It gets confusing and suspicious right

1385
01:11:32,607 --> 01:11:35,935
I think the the thing that has stuck with me maybe most

1386
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:37,471
Well no

1387
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:41,055
There are few things that really stuck with me during the Texas trial

1388
01:11:41,311 --> 01:11:43,871
But one of them that I will never forget

1389
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:46,175
Is when Owen was on the stand

1390
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:47,199
And

1391
01:11:47,455 --> 01:11:50,015
He was being questioned about NPR

1392
01:11:50,271 --> 01:11:51,295
I knew that he was like

1393
01:11:52,063 --> 01:11:54,367
You know there are nonprofit right and Owen just said

1394
01:11:55,647 --> 01:11:57,439
But they still get paid don't they

1395
01:11:57,695 --> 01:11:58,207
Like

1396
01:11:58,463 --> 01:12:01,791
They don't understand the idea of not doing something for money

1397
01:12:03,327 --> 01:12:09,215
Sure I understand we're a nonprofit but this this is what actual not money is is what you're just there

1398
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:15,871
Doing your job and your survival get out not to jump too far from what you're saying but like

1399
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:21,247
Alex and other people in depositions have been very clear about like really do any preparation

1400
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:27,647
No worries if they admitted that they did work it would show Malik make it look hard

1401
01:12:29,183 --> 01:12:31,231
To go to the documents

1402
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:32,767
This is about how hard he works

1403
01:12:33,535 --> 01:12:34,047
And this is the most

1404
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:35,839
I got a few

1405
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:38,143
Documents

1406
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:38,911
Important

1407
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:40,447
Titus altogether

1408
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:43,263
This is a major project

1409
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:47,103
6 years to the last four

1410
01:12:47,615 --> 01:12:48,639
Would literally

1411
01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:50,431
Hundreds of Articles a week

1412
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:52,223
Sometimes thousands

1413
01:12:52,991 --> 01:12:54,271
Every major News Channel

1414
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:55,295
From HBO.

1415
01:12:55,551 --> 01:12:56,063
To PBS

1416
01:12:56,575 --> 01:12:57,087
2

1417
01:12:58,879 --> 01:12:59,647
Over Sandy Hook

1418
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:01,695
Building a giant

1419
01:13:01,951 --> 01:13:02,719
Controversy

1420
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:03,999
When I was not the Sandy Hook me up

1421
01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:05,535
Set the precedent

1422
01:13:06,047 --> 01:13:07,327
The Alex Jones president

1423
01:13:07,839 --> 01:13:10,399
Shut everybody else down. Let's talk about this being the bigger

1424
01:13:12,191 --> 01:13:12,703
Judgment

1425
01:13:13,215 --> 01:13:14,495
U.s. history by an order

1426
01:13:15,775 --> 01:13:16,287
Magnitude

1427
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:20,127
Damn I wish

1428
01:13:20,895 --> 01:13:21,663
Survivors of eps

1429
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:24,479
Receive 965 million

1430
01:13:24,735 --> 01:13:26,271
Exactly good point on Twitter

1431
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:27,551
Elijah

1432
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:34,975
Please write a tweet from Eliza

1433
01:13:36,511 --> 01:13:37,535
And Twitter sucks

1434
01:13:38,815 --> 01:13:41,375
Also a victim should be compensated

1435
01:13:41,631 --> 01:13:43,679
With you

1436
01:13:43,935 --> 01:13:45,215
It's unfortunate you also should

1437
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:48,543
Stay out that billion dollars

1438
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:53,151
We're good that we both agree this is not a zero-sum game

1439
01:13:53,407 --> 01:13:59,295
He also has money that should go elsewhere the both of you have money when you should have zero money

1440
01:13:59,551 --> 01:14:02,367
Call Eliza Eliza

1441
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:06,463
So they have the episode with a q-and-a session

1442
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:10,303
And it's actually only three questions

1443
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:13,887
Questions for people in Steven Crowder mug Club

1444
01:14:14,143 --> 01:14:15,679
The first one

1445
01:14:16,447 --> 01:14:17,471
Yeah I'm a globular Jerry

1446
01:14:17,727 --> 01:14:18,495
Question for you Alex

1447
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:20,287
What do you feel is inappropriate

1448
01:14:28,991 --> 01:14:30,527
Guilty man go free

1449
01:14:30,783 --> 01:14:31,295
Then one

1450
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:34,879
Here's why Alex is the worst

1451
01:14:35,135 --> 01:14:41,279
Saying nothing is so dumb he should have said you pay for my meals for Life totally

1452
01:14:41,535 --> 01:14:46,143
Socrates something come on

1453
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:49,727
What the f*** is wrong with the rare opportunity

1454
01:14:49,983 --> 01:14:53,823
You can actually pull this off. Yeah you are going to die

1455
01:14:54,079 --> 01:14:57,151
And you will not be remembered unless you pull something great

1456
01:14:57,407 --> 01:14:58,431
You got to do it

1457
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:00,735
They got rid of body process

1458
01:15:00,991 --> 01:15:02,015
The judge found me guilty

1459
01:15:02,527 --> 01:15:03,551
They lied about it all

1460
01:15:03,807 --> 01:15:05,599
Exaggerated

1461
01:15:05,855 --> 01:15:06,879
I never said people there now

1462
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:07,903
It's a lie

1463
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:10,463
Setting a precedent to steal your rights

1464
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:12,767
Listen to what you want to listen to

1465
01:15:13,023 --> 01:15:14,047
Decision

1466
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:15,583
They're literally sending this up

1467
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:17,375
To come after the General Public

1468
01:15:17,631 --> 01:15:18,399
An FBI agent

1469
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:20,703
I never saw never covered

1470
01:15:20,959 --> 01:15:22,239
Never said his name

1471
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:26,079
90 million dollars

1472
01:15:26,591 --> 01:15:28,639
Some people on the internet thought it didn't happen

1473
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:38,367
Let me off the hook the more I think about it the more I appreciate the Ted guilty

1474
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:39,903
Should be free

1475
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:44,255
That's not a defense in a trial

1476
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:47,583
Do you like elicit your honor

1477
01:15:47,839 --> 01:15:48,351
I did it

1478
01:15:48,607 --> 01:15:51,935
What can we know everyone did what they did

1479
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:54,751
It's a good idea to let me go free

1480
01:15:55,007 --> 01:15:55,775
Otherwise

1481
01:15:56,031 --> 01:15:57,567
You might put that man in jail

1482
01:15:57,823 --> 01:16:01,919
No no no no. He say that you shouldn't be persecuted

1483
01:16:02,175 --> 01:16:05,759
Guilty people who goes free I feel like

1484
01:16:06,015 --> 01:16:08,319
The implication there he didn't intend

1485
01:16:08,575 --> 01:16:14,719
When did the right way maybe he's thinking he's being a good man but in this situation he really comes off sounding like he's Departed

1486
01:16:14,975 --> 01:16:17,535
Guilty

1487
01:16:17,791 --> 01:16:22,143
You should do a Socrates there's a problem with

1488
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:25,471
Identify this is a lawsuit

1489
01:16:25,727 --> 01:16:27,519
Defamation Ira's that we're against

1490
01:16:28,031 --> 01:16:29,311
Then there's some other lawsuits

1491
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:30,335
That you file

1492
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:32,895
Sir Sir Alex did

1493
01:16:33,151 --> 01:16:38,783
That doesn't come up but other ones like the Covington Catholic charity and we do support these

1494
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:39,807
S***

1495
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:40,831
I need to talk about

1496
01:16:41,855 --> 01:16:42,879
And also it's important

1497
01:16:43,135 --> 01:16:43,903
You'll get lucky.

1498
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:44,927
Saying

1499
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:45,951
Do the write-up

1500
01:16:46,207 --> 01:16:46,719
The double standard

1501
01:16:46,975 --> 01:16:47,487
Because what about Nixon

1502
01:16:49,535 --> 01:16:50,303
They said his name

1503
01:16:50,559 --> 01:16:51,327
The president of the United

1504
01:16:51,583 --> 01:16:52,351
Red State

1505
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:54,911
Associate

1506
01:16:56,191 --> 01:16:56,703
Specifically

1507
01:16:56,959 --> 01:16:57,471
With white supremacy

1508
01:16:57,983 --> 01:16:58,495
They said Nick

1509
01:16:58,751 --> 01:16:59,263
Nick Sandman

1510
01:16:59,519 --> 01:17:00,287
Was mocking some

1511
01:17:01,311 --> 01:17:02,079
Poor native

1512
01:17:02,335 --> 01:17:02,847
Hurricane Nathan

1513
01:17:03,871 --> 01:17:04,383
I prefer my negative

1514
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:06,175
Nathan Phillips

1515
01:17:06,431 --> 01:17:07,967
They said he was mocking Nathan Phillips

1516
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:08,991
You stirring

1517
01:17:09,247 --> 01:17:10,527
They did call out.

1518
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:11,551
My name

1519
01:17:12,575 --> 01:17:13,087
Security

1520
01:17:13,599 --> 01:17:14,367
And if you'd like to go into hiding

1521
01:17:14,879 --> 01:17:15,391
There is a

1522
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:16,671
You did not

1523
01:17:16,927 --> 01:17:17,951
Do that nigut repeated

1524
01:17:19,231 --> 01:17:19,743
All day

1525
01:17:19,999 --> 01:17:21,023
And all night not to mention what

1526
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:21,791
Proceeded

1527
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:22,815
Call right now

1528
01:17:23,327 --> 01:17:24,607
What is the media drumming up

1529
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:25,375
Actual

1530
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:26,143
Hatred

1531
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:32,287
Never showed any evidence people to harass people

1532
01:17:32,543 --> 01:17:33,311
Somebody else did

1533
01:17:34,079 --> 01:17:40,223
So I accepted lying about there being no proof that he sent two people to do town then that led to harassment

1534
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:41,759
Complete horseshit

1535
01:17:42,015 --> 01:17:48,159
Absolute also I guess if Stephen wants to be such a stickler about saying people's names which isn't necessary to prove intent

1536
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:49,695
Emotional distress

1537
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:54,815
He should support Alex paying Robbie Parker 120 million dollars

1538
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:59,935
Does Alex did say his name repeatedly and repeatedly mocked a video of him

1539
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:06,335
Memorial to his daughter

1540
01:18:06,591 --> 01:18:11,711
Are you a vase Crowder is going to put those as his benchmarks for when a case is

1541
01:18:12,223 --> 01:18:13,247
Acceptable

1542
01:18:13,503 --> 01:18:14,527
When we breach those bench

1543
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:16,319
So

1544
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:22,207
I mean if you want to save for some if that's your argument

1545
01:18:22,463 --> 01:18:24,511
That it's like a you have to say the name

1546
01:18:24,767 --> 01:18:27,327
When we reach that Benchmark benchmark

1547
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:28,863
Somebody has to go into hiding

1548
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:31,423
They wanted to hide it so guess what

1549
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:38,079
We're done here I strongly disagree with the point the crabbers make

1550
01:18:38,335 --> 01:18:42,943
Perception he should be like all right Alex adhanom 900 million / 120

1551
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:49,343
Like and if that was his perspective I would think I would be hilarious they would be very funny to me

1552
01:18:49,599 --> 01:18:54,975
There's no way for me to be intellectually consistent and an ox say

1553
01:18:55,487 --> 01:19:00,095
Spiritually physically in this world if I have any

1554
01:19:00,351 --> 01:19:06,495
Intellectual curiosity I can but I have to say that you have 120 million dollars to Robbie Parker

1555
01:19:06,751 --> 01:19:08,799
Do ya so next question

1556
01:19:09,055 --> 01:19:10,079
Of this Cuban a

1557
01:19:10,591 --> 01:19:11,615
Look up your Taylor

1558
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:12,383
Color wants to know

1559
01:19:12,639 --> 01:19:14,687
If you only knew one true thing about you Alex

1560
01:19:14,943 --> 01:19:15,711
Among all these lies

1561
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:17,247
I was going to be my last question

1562
01:19:18,527 --> 01:19:19,039
Boo

1563
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:23,391
I mean look I'm a real person I mention

1564
01:19:23,647 --> 01:19:24,671
I'm trying to get through it all

1565
01:19:25,183 --> 01:19:25,951
I really

1566
01:19:26,463 --> 01:19:27,231
Stephen in the Caribbean

1567
01:19:27,487 --> 01:19:27,999
Righteous

1568
01:19:30,047 --> 01:19:30,559
The truth

1569
01:19:30,815 --> 01:19:32,607
Current

1570
01:19:33,119 --> 01:19:34,655
And just added to this is our rights

1571
01:19:35,935 --> 01:19:36,447
The Hollywood

1572
01:19:36,703 --> 01:19:37,215
Production

1573
01:19:38,751 --> 01:19:39,775
The

1574
01:19:40,031 --> 01:19:41,567
Action of what I supposedly did now bigger

1575
01:19:45,151 --> 01:19:46,431
I'm not the Sandy Hook died

1576
01:19:46,687 --> 01:19:49,247
I'm the guy that wrote the number one best-selling book in the world

1577
01:19:50,527 --> 01:19:51,295
Award for the world

1578
01:19:51,551 --> 01:19:52,575
That's why the global

1579
01:19:52,831 --> 01:19:53,343
Hate me

1580
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:54,623
Exposing their

1581
01:19:56,927 --> 01:19:57,439
Exposing group

1582
01:19:57,951 --> 01:19:58,975
PayPal better back

1583
01:19:59,231 --> 01:19:59,743
By the way

1584
01:20:00,767 --> 01:20:01,535
You say we're going to find you

1585
01:20:01,791 --> 01:20:02,815
$2,500

1586
01:20:03,839 --> 01:20:04,607
I'm opposing

1587
01:20:05,375 --> 01:20:06,399
Authoritarianism

1588
01:20:06,655 --> 01:20:07,423
I'm a populist

1589
01:20:09,727 --> 01:20:10,495
Actually hear the real

1590
01:20:10,751 --> 01:20:12,543
Infowars.com

1591
01:20:13,567 --> 01:20:14,336
Dot-com 4/0

1592
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:17,152
Go see the real life show

1593
01:20:17,664 --> 01:20:18,176
City archives

1594
01:20:21,504 --> 01:20:22,528
You should have little bitty twist

1595
01:20:24,064 --> 01:20:25,600
The corporate media

1596
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:26,624
Globalist

1597
01:20:28,928 --> 01:20:29,696
The flag they want a cap

1598
01:20:30,976 --> 01:20:32,512
Anything else

1599
01:20:33,536 --> 01:20:34,560
Global of TuneIn

1600
01:20:34,816 --> 01:20:35,584
They get scared

1601
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:36,864
Because I know what I'm talking about

1602
01:20:37,376 --> 01:20:38,144
When it comes to the mechanic

1603
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:39,168
The New World Order

1604
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:43,264
So it's interesting how Alex is one true thing contains multiple lies

1605
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:49,664
That's a pretty amazing weird about that if you boil that down his thing about himself that you need to know

1606
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:56,064
How is that he's amazing and he's so strong and smart that everything is just the globalist

1607
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:58,368
It's because he's so strong and right and smart

1608
01:20:59,648 --> 01:21:04,768
School

1609
01:21:05,024 --> 01:21:08,864
Yeah what else is there to say he's going out saying like

1610
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:15,264
I'm the best writer in the world I'm the best talker in the world I'm the most powerful man in the world because the most powerful

1611
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:16,288
People are coming after me

1612
01:21:16,544 --> 01:21:17,056
Like

1613
01:21:17,312 --> 01:21:23,456
Jesus man the devil doesn't come out by the way in this interview weird cuz he seems really Central to the plot line

1614
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:29,856
Also Alex's book has fallen to 322 on the Amazon charts

1615
01:21:30,112 --> 01:21:31,648
Number one just cuz you keep saying it

1616
01:21:31,904 --> 01:21:35,232
And it wasn't ever a number one another that's a problem to

1617
01:21:35,488 --> 01:21:38,560
So actually there's no question and that's it Steven has a question

1618
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:41,888
And take some more chat

1619
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:45,984
What are you doing here neck

1620
01:21:48,032 --> 01:21:49,056
That's really great question

1621
01:21:50,336 --> 01:21:51,360
My biggest enemy

1622
01:21:51,616 --> 01:21:52,128
Myself

1623
01:21:52,896 --> 01:21:53,664
Exhaust

1624
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:04,672
Probably going on

1625
01:22:04,928 --> 01:22:06,720
Yeah I don't think I put one

1626
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:09,280
Little bit of the marijuana

Stop their butt

1630
01:22:27,968 --> 01:22:28,992
Long story short

1631
01:22:29,248 --> 01:22:33,344
He's just doing it to test the potency cuz soros's weaponized marijuana

1632
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:37,952
Just weaponize marijuana houses smoking sometimes two times a week just for fun

1633
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:44,352
To hang out with his buddy single-use maybe not too worried about that maybe that's not a lot. A real thing

1634
01:22:44,608 --> 01:22:46,400
International

1635
01:22:46,656 --> 01:22:47,936
It's here and you just forget about

1636
01:22:48,448 --> 01:22:49,728
It's the most important

1637
01:22:49,984 --> 01:22:52,544
Fight in the world we have to fight against the globalist

1638
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:57,664
Loser drugs in there

1639
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:59,456
Smoking cigarettes is going to be good for him

1640
01:23:00,224 --> 01:23:06,368
That's not good

1641
01:23:06,624 --> 01:23:07,392
Who was outside

01:23:07,648 --> 01:23:09,952
Burning 1 p.m.

1643
01:23:10,464 --> 01:23:11,232
So

1644
01:23:11,488 --> 01:23:13,792
Stephen doesn't want to question though about what's next

1645
01:23:14,304 --> 01:23:18,144
Yeah ibib when he said long story short I wanted to throw up

1646
01:23:18,656 --> 01:23:19,936
Cuz that was a short story that

1647
01:23:20,192 --> 01:23:20,960
Been very long

1648
01:23:21,472 --> 01:23:22,496
What's next

1649
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:25,568
Steven basically just has to pull teeth

1650
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:27,104
To get that out of

1651
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:32,992
Stop their butt

1652
01:23:33,248 --> 01:23:34,272

I think

1677
01:24:22,656 --> 01:24:23,424
You get some rest

1678
01:24:25,472 --> 01:24:26,240
Recoup and come back

1679
01:24:29,824 --> 01:24:31,104

My brain's gone right now so yes

1683
01:24:38,272 --> 01:24:39,040
I realize

1684
01:24:41,344 --> 01:24:42,112
I realize they want to

1685
01:24:43,904 --> 01:24:45,184
I realize that I'm never going to quit

1686
01:24:46,976 --> 01:24:48,512
Because this is a battle of wills

1687
01:24:48,768 --> 01:24:50,560
I also understand

1688
01:24:51,584 --> 01:24:52,608
Take myself out of the game by

1689
01:24:52,864 --> 01:24:54,144

Grow up

1725
01:26:07,104 --> 01:26:08,128
That's another thing to like

1726
01:26:08,384 --> 01:26:12,480
I don't know maybe I'm not cool and I've never really been that cool

1727
01:26:12,736 --> 01:26:13,760
I find it

1728
01:26:14,016 --> 01:26:14,528
Pathetic

1729
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:15,552
To hear like

1730
01:26:15,808 --> 01:26:16,576
40 year olds

1731
01:26:16,832 --> 01:26:20,672
Talking about counterculture

1732
01:26:20,928 --> 01:26:21,440
But like

1733
01:26:21,696 --> 01:26:22,976
As I've gotten older

1734
01:26:23,232 --> 01:26:28,608
The interest in whether or not something is culture counterculture or any of that stuff got

1735
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:31,168
Kind of become something that

1736
01:26:31,424 --> 01:26:37,568
Maybe has a little bit of like an artistic interest to me

1737
01:26:38,848 --> 01:26:39,360
But like

1738
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:46,016
I don't know a lot of the aesthetic trappings and in the lot of that stuff I think is a little bit for the Youth

1739
01:26:46,272 --> 01:26:47,296
And

1740
01:26:47,552 --> 01:26:50,624
You can't be a rebel and have a hundred million dollars first off

1741
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:51,904
That's not how that works

1742
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:58,304
Fugazi wasn't cool and also had a 100 million dollars they were playing in the basement of a

1743
01:26:58,560 --> 01:26:59,328
Dilapidated

1744
01:26:59,584 --> 01:27:00,608
The church they were not

1745
01:27:00,864 --> 01:27:02,912
Doing they weren't doing Green Day Stadium

1746
01:27:03,168 --> 01:27:09,312
Green Day cannot be a rebel and f****** do Madison Square Garden that's not how that works you kind of lose the

1747
01:27:09,568 --> 01:27:15,712
The ability to have credibility of counterculture what is

1748
01:27:15,968 --> 01:27:17,248
You're not a rebel

1749
01:27:17,504 --> 01:27:18,528
Not how that works

1750
01:27:18,784 --> 01:27:20,064
When you have a

1751
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:24,416
CNN level Studio that you're broadcasting from

1752
01:27:24,672 --> 01:27:26,976
Kind of tough to make that argument

1753
01:27:27,232 --> 01:27:31,072
A condemned building comedy show is a rebellious comedy show

1754
01:27:31,328 --> 01:27:37,472
Cultural cultural ISM can really fries

1755
01:27:37,728 --> 01:27:43,104
Being incredibly mainstream show in a baseball delete that is very possible for that to happen

1756
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:49,504
But you're not going to see something that's wildly some versus at like the Laugh Factory

1757
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:50,272
I know it's off

1758
01:27:50,528 --> 01:27:56,672
I don't want to poke I was a countercultural icon when i m c

1759
01:27:57,952 --> 01:27:58,720
Fright

1760
01:27:59,744 --> 01:28:04,096
I get I get what I want to say again and again maybe I'm a square but I

1761
01:28:04,608 --> 01:28:06,144
I cared a lot more about that when I was

1762
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:12,800
19 I mean that that whole idea of selling out or anything along those lines

1763
01:28:13,312 --> 01:28:14,080
Who cares

1764
01:28:14,592 --> 01:28:15,104
Who cares

1765
01:28:16,128 --> 01:28:16,640
I mean

1766
01:28:16,896 --> 01:28:20,736
Did Berry Gordy isn't around anymore you're going to sell out or whatever you know

1767
01:28:21,248 --> 01:28:21,760
It is

1768
01:28:22,016 --> 01:28:23,040
Disgusting

1769
01:28:23,552 --> 01:28:24,320
To think that

1770
01:28:24,576 --> 01:28:28,160
If you and I right now we're at any point in time like

1771
01:28:28,416 --> 01:28:29,184
Listen man

1772
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:33,024
As we sit here in our f****** hoodies and

1773
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:34,048
Tennis shoes like

1774
01:28:34,304 --> 01:28:40,192
Where are the true Rebels going outside

1775
01:28:40,448 --> 01:28:41,472
Helmets

1776
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:42,240
That's not how it

1777
01:28:42,496 --> 01:28:48,640
Works now I sit in a fairly comfortable apartment having overdue to do this

1778
01:28:48,896 --> 01:28:49,408
Dishes

1779
01:28:49,664 --> 01:28:50,944
Surrounded by buttons

1780
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:57,344
And I am neither culture nor counterculture

1781
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:58,624
Berkeley instead of like

1782
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:03,232
Forcing yourself to get rest or whatever the f*** you're talking about Alex grow up

1783
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:04,768
Anyway

1784
01:29:05,024 --> 01:29:07,584
Steven touches on a interesting question and that is

1785
01:29:08,096 --> 01:29:09,376
Why aren't you on Rogan

1786
01:29:10,144 --> 01:29:11,424
You know what you just mentioned something

1787
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:19,872
Joe

1788
01:29:20,128 --> 01:29:22,688
Told me I was like 2 years ago

1789
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:24,992
Weather

1790
01:29:26,016 --> 01:29:27,808
Who's on I haven't heard that before a comedian

1791
01:29:33,184 --> 01:29:34,464
And then

1792
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:36,256
I was just pretty obvious what's going on

1793
01:29:36,512 --> 01:29:37,536
It's a little too much heat

1794
01:29:39,328 --> 01:29:40,352
You got courage about the vax

1795
01:29:42,912 --> 01:29:43,680
Criticizing

1796
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:45,728
He's not as hardcore scene

1797
01:29:45,984 --> 01:29:46,752
I'll just say it

1798
01:29:47,264 --> 01:29:48,288
Overall defense

1799
01:29:48,544 --> 01:29:49,056
Free Spades

1800
01:29:49,312 --> 01:29:50,080
And I just I just don't

1801
01:29:50,336 --> 01:29:50,848
Big joke

1802
01:29:51,104 --> 01:29:51,616
Handle it

1803
01:29:53,152 --> 01:29:54,688
What is it going to take

1804
01:29:54,944 --> 01:30:01,088
Brigiotta's be like I'm done with this what is it going to take. To take I'm done with your truck in Moline

1805
01:30:01,344 --> 01:30:06,464
Promoting you don't give him enough attention he whines and

1806
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:08,768
Tell you you're a piece of s*** f*** off

1807
01:30:09,024 --> 01:30:15,168
Sneaky Snake I'm going to gut him like a pig let's talk about his kid

1808
01:30:15,424 --> 01:30:18,496
It's on a different show

1809
01:30:18,752 --> 01:30:20,800
Yeah any saying essentially

1810
01:30:21,056 --> 01:30:21,568
Hey listen

1811
01:30:21,824 --> 01:30:27,968
Joe's got some courage but that man's a coward at heart exactly

1812
01:30:28,224 --> 01:30:34,368
Outside of college meme I see you wearing that shoulder holster and I think

1813
01:30:34,624 --> 01:30:40,000
There's a man oh man I think that the Maltese Falcon is around the corner

1814
01:30:40,256 --> 01:30:44,096
Like about Rogan not having Imani it's totally cool

1815
01:30:44,608 --> 01:30:45,888
We're out of dinner about a month ago

1816
01:30:47,936 --> 01:30:48,704
And I just bet

1817
01:30:54,336 --> 01:30:55,360
You get on their explain thing

1818
01:30:55,872 --> 01:30:56,640
He just said Alex

1819
01:30:59,456 --> 01:31:00,224
Crisis going on

1820
01:31:02,272 --> 01:31:03,040
I'm not really worried about it

1821
01:31:03,296 --> 01:31:05,344
Obviously I'm the big interview he won

1822
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:06,112
B-17

1823
01:31:09,696 --> 01:31:10,720
It's a big deal to have you on

1824
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:12,512
I'm not worried about it

1825
01:31:12,768 --> 01:31:13,536
It's really a question

1826
01:31:13,792 --> 01:31:14,304
Giorgio's

1827
01:31:18,656 --> 01:31:19,680
You know yet to get a bunch of friends

1828
01:31:20,192 --> 01:31:21,472
I haven't got the whole podcast

1829
01:31:21,984 --> 01:31:25,312
Working on Dylan could have Ian

1830
01:31:25,568 --> 01:31:26,592
I'd love to grow it

1831
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:33,504
The Purge scale

1832
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:35,552
Steven Crowder

1833
01:31:36,064 --> 01:31:37,088
Today

1834
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:40,416
And I'll take it ate all day over our enemies under the zero

1835
01:31:40,672 --> 01:31:42,976
Nothing but thankful to Joe

1836
01:31:43,488 --> 01:31:45,024
He's taken having me on

1837
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:46,560
So you're more than that

1838
01:31:46,816 --> 01:31:47,840
You're also insulted

1839
01:31:51,936 --> 01:31:54,752
But I was going to tell you off everyone but it's private

1840
01:31:55,264 --> 01:31:57,824
The very same people trying to silence me

1841
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:02,432
Some real

1842
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:07,552
And you know I'm on that

1843
01:32:08,064 --> 01:32:08,832
You know I'm on that list

1844
01:32:09,088 --> 01:32:11,136
As well so I know we all deal with it end

1845
01:32:11,392 --> 01:32:17,024
Alabama Joe's getting and guess what so Stephen Stephen doesn't care cuz he attend

1846
01:32:21,376 --> 01:32:22,656
Bunch of loser

1847
01:32:23,168 --> 01:32:23,680
Yep

1848
01:32:24,704 --> 01:32:27,776
It's tough to it's tough to watch a show like this and not

1849
01:32:28,032 --> 01:32:29,056
Really feel sad

1850
01:32:29,312 --> 01:32:29,824
Yeah

1851
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:31,360
This is sad

1852
01:32:33,408 --> 01:32:36,736
It's not good either like I would understand if something had like

1853
01:32:38,016 --> 01:32:42,624
Like an ethos that I disagreed with a lot of points that I didn't agree with right but like

1854
01:32:43,392 --> 01:32:49,280
If Steven Crowder was like he had a spark of real funny in them yeah or if there was like

1855
01:32:49,792 --> 01:32:54,656
An interesting angle and delivery on stuff and his co-host were worth a damn

1856
01:32:54,912 --> 01:32:56,448
And Sidekicks like

1857
01:32:56,704 --> 01:32:57,472
I would I would

1858
01:32:57,728 --> 01:32:58,240
Cedar Lake

1859
01:32:58,496 --> 01:33:01,056
I disagree with this I think it sucks but

1860
01:33:01,312 --> 01:33:01,824
They're doing a show

1861
01:33:02,336 --> 01:33:03,104
This just as bad

1862
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:04,640
From all angles

1863
01:33:05,152 --> 01:33:05,664
Really bad

1864
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:06,432
Yeah man

1865
01:33:06,944 --> 01:33:07,456
That is

1866
01:33:08,224 --> 01:33:12,832
It's just so sad it's so sad all of you are

1867
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:14,880
Are adult men

1868
01:33:15,392 --> 01:33:18,208
Talking about how great you are to children

1869
01:33:18,464 --> 01:33:20,000
Better than Rogan

1870
01:33:20,256 --> 01:33:26,400
That is gross I'm so much more of a big strong boy than Rogan

1871
01:33:26,656 --> 01:33:28,960
So at the end here this is the last clip we've got

1872
01:33:29,216 --> 01:33:30,496
Cuz I got to go to mug Club

1873
01:33:30,752 --> 01:33:33,568
Which is the lake behind the pay wall segments and Alex

1874
01:33:33,824 --> 01:33:35,104
You know who's a rebel

1875
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:36,384
A guy with a mug

1876
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:42,272
Club club Alex's

1877
01:33:42,528 --> 01:33:46,112
Talking at the end about how he has to go to do his own show

1878
01:33:46,624 --> 01:33:50,720
So he's wasn't going to be on that for very long so I don't really care about what's behind the pay wall price

1879
01:33:50,976 --> 01:33:57,120
But it before they leave Alex tries to troll the media is there

1880
01:33:57,376 --> 01:33:57,888
Okay

1881
01:33:58,400 --> 01:33:59,936
Do you want war

1882
01:34:01,216 --> 01:34:03,264
Flooding you in funding you're one of the only

1883
01:34:04,032 --> 01:34:05,056
Professional people doing

1884
01:34:05,824 --> 01:34:06,848
Comedy anime analysis

1885
01:34:07,616 --> 01:34:09,408
He's better than the production of like these like

1886
01:34:10,688 --> 01:34:11,968
Budget 20 times your budget people

1887
01:34:15,552 --> 01:34:17,344
Because unless the real currency we all want

1888
01:34:18,368 --> 01:34:20,416
Infowars

1889
01:34:20,928 --> 01:34:21,440
Everybody

1890
01:34:21,696 --> 01:34:22,720
Steven Crowder

1891
01:34:22,976 --> 01:34:23,488
Who's got the

1892
01:34:23,744 --> 01:34:24,512
500 lb test

1893
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:35,008
Alright marjos balls okay well Steven yours are bigger

1894
01:34:35,264 --> 01:34:36,800
Bigger and even more juicy

1895
01:34:37,312 --> 01:34:38,080
Well Josh

1896
01:34:38,336 --> 01:34:39,872
She did say you've been drinking too much and part of that

1897
01:34:40,384 --> 01:34:42,176
With the vet that I have the under under the cabin

1898
01:34:42,688 --> 01:34:43,456
Microwave I've learned my

1899
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:50,624
Charger battery

1900
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:52,672
Alex Jones in the robotic homosexual

1901
01:34:53,696 --> 01:34:54,208
All right look

1902
01:35:01,376 --> 01:35:04,192
When do I get my 900000000

1903
01:35:04,704 --> 01:35:05,216
For what

1904
01:35:06,496 --> 01:35:08,032
This is this is

1905
01:35:08,544 --> 01:35:09,312
Funny

1906
01:35:10,592 --> 01:35:14,688
Tell his his balls joke

1907
01:35:14,944 --> 01:35:16,480
And then say it's funny

1908
01:35:16,736 --> 01:35:17,504
That's a bad sign

1909
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:18,784
That's not good no

1910
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:20,320
I didn't know it was a joke

1911
01:35:21,088 --> 01:35:27,232
Might get her done back when I did stand up while it's funny

1912
01:35:27,488 --> 01:35:30,816
No.

1913
01:35:31,072 --> 01:35:35,168
This is like things are less effective when

1914
01:35:35,424 --> 01:35:36,192
You say like

1915
01:35:36,448 --> 01:35:39,264
I am doing this so the media will report on it

1916
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:45,664
That's fun and sad also the thing that makes it funny is that both of them

1917
01:35:48,224 --> 01:35:53,344
Violently aggressive is that what's funny is that they can dip into the into there

1918
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:59,488
They make that they make a joke of talking about Stevens balls because

1919
01:35:59,744 --> 01:36:02,048
It is gay to them

1920
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:03,328
Right right

1921
01:36:03,584 --> 01:36:04,608
But I mean they know that

1922
01:36:05,888 --> 01:36:10,240
We just spent too much time with I don't know I don't know what people who aren't

1923
01:36:10,496 --> 01:36:15,104
It's funny really find funny you know it's funny to them because they're engaging in

1924
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:16,640
Form of homophobia

1925
01:36:16,896 --> 01:36:23,040
Right from the target being hurt by homophobia

1926
01:36:24,064 --> 01:36:25,856
To them it's a transgressive concept

1927
01:36:26,112 --> 01:36:30,720
Someone saying that would blow their f****** minds into laughter

1928
01:36:30,976 --> 01:36:34,816
I get that but I don't get it I don't get it

1929
01:36:35,584 --> 01:36:38,656
Man I think that this would have been

1930
01:36:39,424 --> 01:36:41,728
Just a wave

1931
01:36:41,984 --> 01:36:48,128
Maybe quite a ways below like Andrew Dice Clay in the 80s

1932
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:54,784
Rebellious

1933
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:57,856
But I can still record still laughing

1934
01:36:58,112 --> 01:37:00,160
At things that are sophomores

1935
01:37:00,416 --> 01:37:03,488
But you just have to be good you have to be at there has to be

1936
01:37:03,744 --> 01:37:06,304
Cleverness there has to be Direction there has to be

1937
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:12,704
AAA same tent or thought behind it are you know something along those lines

1938
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:17,568
From the construction standpoint the joke is the media reports on this

1939
01:37:17,824 --> 01:37:19,872
Interview as

1940
01:37:20,128 --> 01:37:21,408
Alex likes

1941
01:37:21,664 --> 01:37:22,944
Stevens juicy balls

1942
01:37:23,456 --> 01:37:24,736
Right that's the

1943
01:37:24,992 --> 01:37:26,016
The the

1944
01:37:26,528 --> 01:37:30,112
Bmusic image is the news running that headline

1945
01:37:30,368 --> 01:37:36,512
I'll put the real joke is that the news isn't going to cover this at all this interview at all

1946
01:37:38,304 --> 01:37:43,680
It's Imagining the ways in which you are tricking the media into a troll headline

1947
01:37:43,936 --> 01:37:49,056
Doesn't come to that is it is very funny to listen to these guys imagine

1948
01:37:49,312 --> 01:37:49,824
How

1949
01:37:50,336 --> 01:37:50,848
They're out

1950
01:37:51,104 --> 01:37:51,616
PetSmart

1951
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:57,504
Yeah that's very funny it's all it's all in there their game

1952
01:37:58,528 --> 01:37:59,040
Being

1953
01:37:59,552 --> 01:38:00,064
Yeah

1954
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:05,184
So this suck time but I don't I don't want to listen to anymore stevencrowder very bad

1955
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:11,584
Brutal probably not that much

1956
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:15,424
Difference between

1957
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:18,240
In terms of the stuff I think part of that is because

1958
01:38:18,496 --> 01:38:19,264
He clearly felt

1959
01:38:19,776 --> 01:38:21,568
The ability to steamroll Steven

1960
01:38:21,824 --> 01:38:24,128
Yeah that wasn't hard clips

1961
01:38:24,384 --> 01:38:25,408
I was not hard

1962
01:38:26,432 --> 01:38:31,040
So I think there is a sense that like all right I'm just going to do my show on his show

1963
01:38:31,296 --> 01:38:37,440
He can't handle me he's got no chance

1964
01:38:37,696 --> 01:38:38,976
Midas balls

1965
01:38:39,232 --> 01:38:40,000
Yeah it is

1966
01:38:40,256 --> 01:38:41,024
It is like

1967
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:42,048
Who is like

1968
01:38:42,304 --> 01:38:48,192
Kicking a choirboy and then patting him on the head being like that you did such a great job getting kicked

1969
01:38:48,448 --> 01:38:51,008
Yeah but there really isn't a ton of like a

1970
01:38:51,264 --> 01:38:56,128
Message discrepancy it is just kind of like I've been wronged

1971
01:38:56,384 --> 01:38:59,456
I didn't get a trial Baba bother coming for you

1972
01:38:59,712 --> 01:39:02,272
Explain to me how

1973
01:39:02,784 --> 01:39:04,576
A man can insist

1974
01:39:04,832 --> 01:39:09,696
That he is both apologized and taken responsibility for his behavior

1975
01:39:09,952 --> 01:39:10,720
And yet

1976
01:39:10,976 --> 01:39:11,744
Still be like

1977
01:39:12,256 --> 01:39:13,536
Will they let you get nothing

1978
01:39:15,328 --> 01:39:18,144
That's Christopher Alex Club did not ask

1979
01:39:18,656 --> 01:39:23,008
The book club does not do a lot of follow-up

1980
01:39:24,544 --> 01:39:29,920
Another reason why he can have message discipline and stay with the same thing as easy as 140

1981
01:39:30,176 --> 01:39:36,320
Seems I can ask him if it's in no way a hostile environment I would say that Rogan

1982
01:39:36,576 --> 01:39:40,416
Is a more confrontational interviewer than pins

1983
01:39:40,928 --> 01:39:42,208
Just cuz he be like

1984
01:39:42,464 --> 01:39:44,768
Maybe say something funny about that

1985
01:39:45,024 --> 01:39:48,096
The Stephen did the same thing the Greenwald did which is like

1986
01:39:48,352 --> 01:39:51,936
Try to offer answers.

1987
01:39:52,192 --> 01:39:54,240
This would be a good answer if you want to just take the

1988
01:39:54,496 --> 01:40:00,384
Yeah it is he was massaging Alex's shoulders while you doing

1989
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:02,688
In being interviewed while interviewing

1990
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:05,760
Imagine

1991
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:09,344
But until then

1992
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:12,416
We have a website

1993
01:40:12,672 --> 01:40:14,976
Worldstar Fights

1994
01:40:15,232 --> 01:40:21,376
I saw your Tweet today the algorithm knows that I f****** hate gungrave

1995
01:40:21,632 --> 01:40:24,448
I get so mad

1996
01:40:27,008 --> 01:40:32,896
I will be back but until then I'm eom Leo mdci scar kind Wilfred Snapple Snapple of the Gravel Pit Bull

1997
01:40:33,408 --> 01:40:34,176
And now here comes

1998
01:40:34,432 --> 01:40:35,200
The sex robot

1999
01:40:39,808 --> 01:40:43,392
