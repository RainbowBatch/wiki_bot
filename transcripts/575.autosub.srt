1
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for knowledge but I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

2
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,136
Dot-com

3
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,536
Everybody welcome back and I'll try to sit around and talk a little bit about

4
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:06,816
Alex Jones

5
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:09,120
Jordan Jordan

6
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:15,264
Jordan is the continuing of the button

7
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,800
Sending them out

8
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:23,200
What are things that I mentioned that a previous episode was the guy we're taking care of the postage and everything

9
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:24,224
So inclined

10
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,504
Because a lot of people have offered

11
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,528
Paper postage

12
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:31,904
2 number of people in foreign countries

13
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,232
I understand

14
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:37,536
Meson on people's generosity

15
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:38,816
Metaphorically

16
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:41,376
You know why you sneeze there but be that as it may

17
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:47,776
Are we could do is find a charity and donate in the name of saline

18
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:51,104
My cat over the world

19
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,896

00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:57,504
That I wanted to share this is my brights Bach

00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,040
Frederick h

23
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:00,832
Adopted

24
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,112
An elephant

25
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:07,488
In Kenya alright alright I'm listening I'm listening

Baby elephant

Oh my God

31
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:30,016
That's that's one of those moments where you're like I didn't realize the scope of this

32
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:36,416
Your cat is fostering a baby elephant and then you're like okay the world's got great something so great about the creativity

33
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:40,256
The Listener is like Frederick as well like this

I got taking the ball and running with it

35
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,072
It's a doing something really

36
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,864
Cool lands

37
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:47,680
Overwhelmingly beautiful

38
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:49,216
Yes those are personal message

39
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,008
Which came in with that that is my neck is

40
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,800
Ashley large

41
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:53,824
From the elephant

42
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:59,456
That's true so thank you for everything was really awesome and really bright

43
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:01,504

44
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,272
Yeah I just

45
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:05,344
My mom is a huge elephant person

46
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:13,024
It was a nice Coincidence of the

47
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,072
Parent relationship

48
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,632
Now we just need

49
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:18,912
Now we just need to

50
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,704
Unite them and have

51
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,496
Celine stand atop

52
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:27,360
Offended all time we're heading to Canton I think we have to

53
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:32,736
Absolutely

54
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:36,576
What's your bright spot is far less

55
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:40,672
Sequential kind of makes me feel a little embarrassed at this is my bright spot

56
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:43,232
Have you ever had a cutting

57
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,000
Candy grape

58
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:44,768
Stan

59
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:51,424
No I was trying to think of what they did

60
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,192
Flavor God

61
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:54,752
I see now this is the opposite

62
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:56,288
Cotton candy flavor grape

63
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,592
It taste like cotton candy

64
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:00,384
Cotton candy really is just

65
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,152
Sugar

66
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,712
Sugar grapes

67
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:06,016
Understand alright and this is why it's my bright spot

68
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:07,808
Judging is a

69
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:14,208
Exactly as defensive about that as you would imagine it's not just sugar it seriously

70
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:18,303
Cotton candy and they know that your is your first reaction is going to be like

71
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,839
Oh okay so they're sweet grape

72
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:22,655
And then you eat one in your like s*** this tastes like cotton

73
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,679
Candy and there

74
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,983
Judging is so f****** divots like

75
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:28,543
Do you think it's just sugar

76
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:35,199
Give us a chance give us a chance

77
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,735
Weird yeah I know

78
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,831
Fantastic

79
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:43,135
Candy grapes

80
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:47,231
Well that's cool. I'll keep my eyes open

81
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:47,999
Great

82
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,815
Also I saw that someone posted a picture of

83
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:56,959
These Skittles gummies with weed in them

84
00:04:57,215 --> 00:05:03,359
Samsung mail them to us I think that still with federal crime so you should be able to find them no based on

85
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:06,687
The legality here in the city of Chicago

86
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,527
Episode to go over

87
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,063
What about

88
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,599
4th of July

89
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:16,927

Work before we get to that

96
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,031
We're going to get deep

97
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,359
Giving someone life is giving someone death

98
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,687
You can say that

99
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:43,807
Good

100
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:46,111

Whenever he lands upon you know

104
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:55,583

The Washington Post

124
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:03,423
Thank you for helping me become the Wonka a day or perhaps I should be asking for an apology

125
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,727

Be disappointed if you didn't and those brackets otherwise we got to make sure I got over

128
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:14,687
Slanderous

129
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,991
So Jordan out on the 4th

130
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:19,551
Was over the weekend

131
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,343
Put out a special report

132
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,623
They put out a report on

133
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,391
On the 4th

134
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:26,207
I thought was

135
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:26,975
You know

136
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,791
Underwhelming okay

137
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:34,911
Think about

138
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,239
Captain's hat

139
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,031
I got to stop right there early

140
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:46,431
But he is wearing that captain's hat that may or may not be the same one from his Halloween store

141
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,711
One from his

142
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:52,319
Halloween store

143
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:56,415
In order for him to be like

144
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,695
I wonder.

145
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,719

00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:08,703
Example

151
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:09,471
I'm declaring

152
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:10,239

1 State 1

156
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,711
The big interview in emerging

Podcast

160
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,111
Can you do 1

161
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,159
Demonetized

162
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:30,719
Because their cover

163
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:36,863
This episode of Rogan's podcast but Alex is referring to came out on June 22nd

164
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:40,191
And didn't feature to scientist covid-19

165
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:45,823
If you did one scientist make a quarry and what member of the intellectual dark web named Brett wine

166
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,639
If you don't remember Bret Weinstein

167
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,407
I envy you

168
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,687
You Rose to problem

169
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:55,807
It's because he was a professor at Evergreen State College and got really mad about the 2017 day of abs

170
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,855
Have you forgot about that it was

171
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,647
Are minority students

172
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,183
Some faculty members confused

173
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,975
Stay off campus has a way of celebrating

174
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:03,999
But things they bring to the

175
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,279
Yeah I remember

176
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:09,119
Decided to try to reverse the experience and ask

177
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,167
Tobacco Tita voluntarily stay off

178
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:16,799
This guy so much out of this and took it upon himself to enlist the help

179
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,591
Fox News

00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,615
Turn this into one of the most

00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:25,247
Pressing matters of free speech in America

182

This national attention Charlie made the situation on campus more intense and protests began escalated Wichita

183
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:36,767
Culminated in Weinstein and his wife resigning from the school and suing for 3.8 billion dollars

184
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:39,071
Climbing at the school that failed to protect him from Stu

185
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:47,263
Shoes for 250,000

186
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,031
Dollars each

187
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,591
Which is a ridiculously small amount for the couples

188
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,383
Except unless they knew they were lucky

189
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,919
Need to get anything yeah they were very

190
00:09:54,943 --> 00:10:01,087
Gaston Rogan a few times and it's just a general dumb dumb hanging out with idiots like Jordan Peterson and

191
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:01,855
Dave Rubin

192
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:08,767
In the 2020 election he uses position to try to drive Tulsi gabbard

193
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,815
On the unity2020 ticket

194
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:17,471
Well that would have done it that would have solved that better

195
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:19,519
Because that's what would have happened on that one

196
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:26,175
What ticket would appeal to the left and the right order nobody can't think of more of an oxymoronic

197
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,199
Statement that emergency

198
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:27,967
Podcast

199
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:32,831
Yeah that is weird sort of joke

200
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:39,231
Also Bret Weinstein brother is another

201
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:41,791
Remember the intellectual dark web

202
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:45,375
Who's one of the managing directors at teal capital

203
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:49,471
That company of course is run by Peter teal who famously made giant donations

204
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,263
The trumps 2016 camping

205
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,287
Boca the Republic

206
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:55,871
Intervention that year and of course bankrolled Hulk Hogan's lawsuit that took down Gawker

207
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:58,175
Yeah there's it there's very little difference

208
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:58,943
Between teal

209
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:01,759
Capital and the Legion of Doom

210
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,807
The weinsteins are

211
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,087
Super cool

212
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,111
The Great

213
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:10,463
Lately Brett has been getting some covid territory and

214
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,487
Been widely rebuke

215
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:12,511
Republic promotion

216
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:13,535
Ivermectin

217
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,559
The cure for the virus

218
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,351
He was going on Rogan

219
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,887
Didn't show to discuss this along with

220
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:18,655
This doctor friend

221
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:25,567
Pierre Corey is a doctor who's been making very suspect claims about Ivermectin since at least late 2020 calling you

222
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:26,847
Get a quote wonder drug

223
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,639
Even though the actual evidence for such a

224
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,919
The claim is very lacking

225
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:33,247
There are some studies that appear to indicate slight benefits that

226
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:36,063
Could come from Ivermectin but they are far from descendants

227
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,855
Other studies showed no Bennett

228
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:38,623
The drug the drug

229
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,903
There just isn't consist

230
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:43,743
Good data to show that it's a qrm people go around promoting it is such a

231
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:44,511
Acting in ways that are

232
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,559
Super dangerous for the General Public

233
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,607
Anyway

234
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:55,007
Fourth of July special report and he decided to open by talking about her Joe Rogan didn't episode 2 weeks ago with this doctor

235
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,567
16 overhyping Ivermectin

236
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,615
And that's a declaration of

237
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:01,919
Independence or something this sad

238
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:02,687
Yeah that's

239
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:03,455
That's great

240
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,247
This is a mess

241
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:11,903
You know July is history about the 4th of July episode

242
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:14,975
Listen to The History of the United

243
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:18,047
Midstates I just want to say that one of the big problem

244
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,839
Sunset really is coming back to bite us

245
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:22,911
Is our long history of loving

246
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:27,775
Snake oil salesman to the point where now you can hear the word wonder drug

247
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:28,799
And I go

248
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:31,359

I love Wonder drugs in your leg while we're just stuck with this forever

250
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:39,551
This is just how we live we made a mistake in being like

251
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:40,831
Like

252
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:47,231
Cheer it rooting for the the scam artists needle

253
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:50,815
Phil Hartman crushing the monorail song we would be way better off

254
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:55,679
You think that's where it's at all goes back to the Sims

255
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:58,751
Everything goes back on this episode

256
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,799
This special report to Brogan

I guess.

258
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,615
That's what the 4th of July the bout

259
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,663

262
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,343
To have them on

263
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,135
Discouraged

264
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,975
A few days ago

265
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:22,303
So I guess I want to watch the whole thing and didn't realize the bright wines

266
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,863
Seeing isn't day censored covid doctor

267
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,655
Cuz weird courage it

268
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:27,679
To bring

269
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:30,751

270
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:34,079
100 million dollar podcast

271
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,895
Spray listened by the most number of

272
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:39,455
People in the world

273
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:44,319
Also sent to come out and before this Fourth of July report that I was doing

274
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,599
Rogan

275
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,879
Quentin Tarantino on his

276
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:47,647
The gas what you did

277
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:48,927
Infuriate Alex

278
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:51,231
Alex hates Quentin Tarantino

279
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:55,839
And Joe should know better than that kind of a globalist on his show

280
00:13:56,095 --> 00:14:00,959
I'm going to get people to travel an emergency episode

281
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:04,031
Oh man I'm going to try and get back on

282
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:06,335
So we got a little headline here so that way

283
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,127
The defender had a

284
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:10,943
Robin's emergency podcast question

285
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:11,711
YouTube Center

286
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:13,247
I'm content

287
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:17,599
19

288
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:18,879
You hear the defender

289
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,159
No

290
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:25,279
That seems like an interesting citation I didn't really hurt him toss out that is a place he got news from before

291
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:27,071
I thought that was just like a person

292
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,607
Who is defending

293
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:35,519
Tweet to Twitter Defender Defender is Ableton Outlet

294
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:39,359
Turns out it's an online publication put out by group called The Children

295
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:46,015
There we go that's an anti-abortion group

296
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:51,135
Christian bulshit

297
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:57,535
I love defending the healthy children know everybody does have

298
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,351
Children's events

299
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:08,287
Anti-vax outfit run by Robert Kennedy Jr

300
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:13,919
Baby Gannon 2016 being called the world Mercury project potential

301
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:15,967
A name probably because they want to try it

302
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:18,015
Obscure the fact that they are out Now intent

303
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:18,783
Anti-vax

304
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:23,903
Advocates as opposed to Independent providers of information

305
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:24,671
To reseed them

306
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:31,071
Nonno's got to Mercury being in the vaccine

307
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,607
Axiom propagandist it makes

308
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:36,703
No sense why they would call their Outlets up the Kentucky with like the defender

309
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,287
So you can say their articles about sounding like you're the kind of person who takes forever

310
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,823
Kennedy Junior seriously

311
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,871
Cuz that's one of the sources

312
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:45,663
Consider is not fake news

313
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,711
Pretty sweet

314
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:48,991
That's real great

315
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,271
Graton real great

316
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:53,599
It's kind of funny how they get like

317
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:58,207
Hated by people who are anti-vax people who get

318
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:00,767
A money from being anti-vax people

319
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,303
And by putting this out

320
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:05,631
People are less likely to take vaccines and more likely to give money

321
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:07,423
To the anti-vax people who pay

322
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,471
For the coverage in the defender

323
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:10,751
Some people

324
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:13,055
I'm starting to see how this busy

325
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:13,823
Model work

326
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,919
It is it works it doesn't work

327
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:22,015
So we have one last clip of this Fourth of July Special Report with

328
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:25,087
What is italics in the middle of a field or maybe his backyard I don't know

329
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,623
Chavez had on

330
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:29,183
Probably taking a break

331
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:35,583
Europa BBQ barbecued hamburger around

332
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:41,983
Call Rob do passed out on a chair

333
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:46,591
Got it Buckley is fixing on the ones and twos they had to ask him to turn off the music

334
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,895
Look for a little bit Special Report

335
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:53,759
Yeah this is this is the last little blip I have

336
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,551
So I hereby declare

337
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,647
From the New World Order

338
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:03,231
Again

339
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:05,535
I pledge my life my honor my

340
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:07,839
Find

341
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:09,631
Everything I am

342
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:11,679
Tommy Oliver Liberties Thomas Jefferson

343
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,727
Over every form of tyranny

344
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,799
So I mean like your response

345
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:23,199
Is so right I mean

346
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:25,503
Discussion about Jefferson and Alex

347
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,527
Scalded himself

348
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:32,671
I don't I think that we've gone into this a little bit in the past but I want to read you the larger context of that Jeffers

349
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,463
Quotes

350
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:38,815
This is from a letter from 1800 that he sent to me

351
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:39,839
Monroe

352
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:40,863
Quote

353
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:43,679
I promise you a letter on Christianity which I have not forgotten

354
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:49,311
On the contrary is because I've reflected on it that I find much more time necessary for it then I go

355
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,335
At present

356
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,103
Disposed of

357
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:55,967
I have a view of the subject with which ought to displease neither rational Christian or dies

358
00:17:56,223 --> 00:18:00,063
And would reconcile many to a character they have too hastily reject

359
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:04,415
I do not know however it would reconcile the irritable tribe of prophet

360
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,695
It's who are all in arms against

361
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:09,791
Their hostility is onto interesting ground to be softened

362
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,863
The delusions into which the XYZ plot

363
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,143
Shoot it possible to push

364
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:14,911
The people

365
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:20,031
This whole experiment made under the prevalence of that delusion on the cause of the Constitution

366
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:21,567
Well it secure the freedom of

367
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:23,871
The Press covered also the freedom of religion

368
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,407
Given to the clergy affair

369
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,687
Favorite hope of a

370
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:27,967
Obtaining an establishment

371
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:31,039
Of a particular form of Christianity through the United

372
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:31,807
States

373
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,623
And does every sect believes its own form.

374
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:35,391
True one

375
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,671
Perhaps

376
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:37,951
Hope for E-Town

377
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:41,023
But especially the episcopalians and congregational

378
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:44,095
The returning good sense of our country threatened

379
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:45,375
Is abortion to their hopes

380
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:49,983
They believe that any position of power conveyor confided to me

381
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,263
Will be exerted in

382
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,543
Position to their scheme

383
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,335
And they believe truly

384
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:59,967
Bribe sworn upon the altar of God Eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man

385
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:01,759
But this is all they have

386
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:02,527
You're from me

387
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:03,295
And

388
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:09,183
Slavery is every form of tyranny over the

389
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:15,583
Google well it is true that Thomas Jefferson said essentially the words that Alex loves to quote the reality is that

390
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,863
Everytime Alex repeat

391
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,911
That's saying he's using it incorrect

392
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:23,007
The contact the Jefferson said those words and had to do with an opposition

393
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:24,543
To Christian churches using

394
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,311
The first

395
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,335
Freedom of religion

396
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:30,687
To establish what would effectively be an official religion of the United States

397
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:37,599
Around 1,800 he would have absolutely been one of the irritable tribe of prophets who were at war with

398
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:38,367
Jefferson

399
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:44,767
The irony of Alex using this quote to pump himself up in his quest to bring about a Christian theocracy in the United

400
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,815
That is not lost on me

401
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:52,191
It's understood the primary resources he uses I honestly think that this would be a plus troll

402
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:56,287
Using this quote in the way that he uses it while pushing

403
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,567
For the things that you push

404
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:03,199
It's analogous exactly to their form of Christianity insofar as

405
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:03,967
It's like

406
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:08,063
It says what we say it doesn't God damn you if you read it

407
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:15,231
Terrible idea you'll realize that it doesn't mean what we say it means and that's why we tell you not to raid

408
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:18,303
I found this video message really confusing

409
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,607
The title of it is we're winning

410
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:23,679
Alex Jones's 2021 Fourth of July message

411
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:28,543
It's kind of flies in the face of his routine Outburst about how we're all going to die whenever you have Tech problems

412
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,103
Studio right but whatever

413
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:37,503
Considering he's wearing a Nazi hat while he's doing this they are we have

414
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:39,551
Itself was basically just a

415
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:41,087
I'm trying to pump himself up

416
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:43,391
Open talking about a recent episode of the Rogan podcast

417
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:45,951
He spends like a third of the video suggest

418
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:49,279
Austin guest the Trojan Azan

419
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:50,303
Did he suggest

420
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,071
No

421
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:52,095
That's surprising

422
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:55,167
A number to preemptively reject that invitation

423
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:03,359
Let's be clear will never come

424
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:07,199
Go on if it's Tim J Dillon and Joe Rogan I just get the s*** on them all the time

425
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:08,479
I'll do it

426
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,831
I felt like this video is just pathetic

427
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:14,111
And it was

428
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:16,928
The energy that Alex was bringing on the 4th of July which

429
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:19,488
Should be this day to shine I just don't know how interested

430
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:21,536
I could possibly be to see what he's doing

431
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,328
On the 5th or talk about

432
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,096
I just like

433
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:24,864
If you can't

434
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:26,656
What get it going on the 4th

435
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:29,216
You a you have really disappointed

436
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:33,312
Yeah I really thought that he was going to come and when you said there was a July 4th

437
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:35,616
Special video I thought he was going to come out

438
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:37,920
Critical race Theory

439
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:41,760
That's the thing in my mind that was like that's him going to be patriotic

440
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:43,808
Something

441
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:44,832
So

442
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:46,112
I just was like okay

443
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:47,136
You're on timeout

444
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:48,928
I'm going to look around your website

445
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:49,952
See what I can fit

446
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:50,976
Figure out if I can get

447
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:52,768
Get the temperature of Infowars

448
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:56,096
Based on bam. Video see what's going on

449
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:57,888
Everything thanks

450
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:01,728
First thing I found was that all was Alex's shows have recently been

451
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:02,752
Been pushing Nick Fuentes

452
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:04,032
Quite a bit

453
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,384
I suspect one element of this as I think that Nick was recently liked in

454
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,688
So you just went did all the shows

455
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:13,760
Also I think that Nick might be realizing who cares

456
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:15,808
Do I have to lose by trying

457
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:21,696
To steal Alex's audience are putting already an out-and-out avowed white nationalist

458
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:27,072
What's lower

459
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:30,144
Best I can do is probably a co-op to Alex's audience

460
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,424
Get them over on my side

461
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,728
The worst thing that can happen is

462
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:37,824
Kicks off Infowars streaming platform

463
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,896
Cuz I'm too right but then I get

464
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:42,688
Call Alex's Zionist

465
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:49,088
Best caulk or something no matter what

466
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:51,648
So also the other thing that I realized it

467
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:52,928
Is bad news

468
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:53,952
For them

469
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:56,768
I compared the The View totals

470
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:57,536
Of

471
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:59,072
Of the other main shows

472
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:03,680
Harrison Smith American Journal

473
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:04,704
Man

474
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:10,080
But for some of their clickbait titles of they're like little videos little little clips

475
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:13,152
Some of my bouquet views

476
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:13,920
Man

477
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:14,688
No one

478
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:17,248
Is watching their actual shows

479
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:18,272
No man's land

480
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:20,576
Over there in terms of their they're full

481
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:22,112
Full videos of who

482
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:25,440
I almost want to go back and see how many old David night View

483
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:29,792
We have now and just see if he's really like kicking himself just going

484
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:32,352
Oh my god dammit I've got Harrison Smith

485
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:35,168
Boring people with his white nationalist garbage

486
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,520
I think the David Knight had

487
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,800
Appeal to a different

488
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:42,080
Segment then

489
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:45,920
Any of these shows do I think so too

490
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:51,296
Terrible decision from a business control

491
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:54,624
The noodle Stevens on show yet

492
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:57,952
So I felt like it was time like I said take a little bit of a day

493
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:00,256
Little Bear

494
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:02,048
Honestly though

495
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:03,840
Harrison we're looking like real disa

496
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:04,608
Appointments

497
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:06,144
I realized

498
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,424
They're featuring Nick Fuentes

499
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,192
Ocelot

500
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:12,288
And then I remembered that Nick was just giving his own channel on Alex's website

501
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:18,688
Bam dog video God he has his own America first channel on there maybe it was time that we

502
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:19,712
You check-in

503
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:22,272
And see what kind of car

504
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:24,064
Alex is signing off on

505
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,368
And hosting AutoZone website phukmi

506
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:32,512
No, why are you making me do this so mad what would happen

507
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:33,536
I honestly

508
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:37,120
I think that when I started this I was like I was before this will make Jordan

509
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:39,936
And as I got through it is like wow

510
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:41,472
I can't believe

511
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,152
Even more overt than I was expecting

512
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:51,712
Wow cool cool cool cool cool

513
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:53,760
The first video that I

514
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:56,832
Let's check this out

515
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:57,856
Title of it is

516
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:01,184
The purpose of Juneteenth is white replacement

517
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,280
If they changed it to that

518
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:06,560
I'm fine with it

519
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:11,936
Also that have to change it to that

520
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:14,752
Fine with that this

521
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:15,520
Starts

522
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,568
And here's our latest

523
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,432
Piece of s***

524
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:23,456
Sean R&B

525
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,480
B singer and I'm sure

526
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:26,272
The sentiment shared by a lot of black

527
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:29,856
She says why stop

528
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,648
Today we should have a new America

529
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:32,416
Working flag

530
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:33,696
This is an op-ed

531
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:34,464
She wrote she said

532
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,232
The quote

533
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:36,768
Confederate Battle Flag wood

534
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:38,304
Which was created as a symbol of op

535
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,584
Opposition to the Avalanche

536
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,352
Mission of slavery

537
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:42,656
Is just recently tired

538
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:45,216
We don't see it much anymore however on the six

539
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:47,264
When the stormers rained on the nation

540
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,032
Most precious

541
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:48,800
Is hot

542
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:50,080
Waving Old Glory

543
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:51,104
The memo was

544
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,128
Receive the American

545
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,152
Flag is it

546
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:53,920
Replacement

547
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:57,248
A little disappointing that the underpinning of Nick's argument is in

548
00:25:57,504 --> 00:26:00,320
Op-ed there was written by Macy Gray that was published

549
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:03,392
Not in the New York Times or the Washington Post but on MarketWatch

550
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:06,208
No disrespect to Macy Gray or MarketWatch

551
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:08,512
But this isn't the level of thing that I would expect to sell for

552
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:09,280
Respect

553
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:10,304
Nationalistic series

554
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,096
No disrespect

555
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:13,376
To Macy Gray

557
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:20,032
If you pay close attention to how Nick is discussing this article you can see a couple of really important to sumption

558
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:20,800
And Fabrication

559
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:23,104
But he has to make an order for this to even be something

560
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,384
Can use for his Naruto

561
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:29,760
The first is that he has to take this op-ed written by Macy Gray and presented

562
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:33,344
Present opinion that making sure is shared by a lot of non-white

563
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:40,256
I guess if what Nick was responding to is a giant Groundswell of support for this outfit specifically a non-white communities

564
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:42,048
We might be able to make that rhetoric

565
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:46,144
Call trick work but as it stands he's just responding to one person's opinion

566
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,192
And then pretending he's responding to Atkins

567
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:49,216
Consensus View

568
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:53,056
He's doing that because he knows would come off as a little sad if you were

569
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:55,360
This upset about an op-ed written by a singer

570
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:57,408
Who's biggest hit came out just after his

571
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:58,432
First birthday

572
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:01,504
He has to make a much bigger deal out of this than it is to

573
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,528
To justify his out

574
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:05,856
The second thing he does is escalate the argument

575
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:07,392
It's being made by Macy Gray

576
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:08,672
Nixos quote

577
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:12,256
She says why I stopped it Independence Day we should have a new American

578
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:13,024
In flag

579
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:17,120
This op-ed says nothing about replacing Independence Day with Juneteenth

580
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:17,888
Just

581
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:22,240
Adapt to the argument the greys make

582
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,008
King of the Peace

583
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:25,824
This is just about the idea that maybe we should get a new flag

584
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:32,224
A bunch of s*** also DC and Puerto Rico should be States so we should add more stars

585
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:35,040
Grade does even bring up our flag hasn't

586
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:37,856
Consistent through the country's history and the current versions

587
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:40,672
Only like

588
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:45,536
Better things you can agree with or disagree with you can think of

589
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:47,584
If a good idea to make a new flag or think of

590
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,352
The bad one

591
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:53,216
But in order for your reaction to rise to the level of racist outrage that Nick wants to engage in

592
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:54,240
You really do have to

593
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:57,312
Create a strawman version to attack so that's what he's doing

594
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:01,920
This isn't just an op-ed written by Macy Gray she's speaking for large groups

595
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:05,504
Non-white sure about a flag redesign

596
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,784
Secretly about replacing it

597
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:08,320
Ended stay with Juneteenth

598
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:12,672
Nonsense and he will not like my interpretation.

599
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:14,976
Lisa Left Eye and

600
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:16,256

Miss of burning down house

602
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:19,584
Is it snowing out right now because

603
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,936
I'm pretty sure I read an op-ed by Lisa Left Eye has ghost said burn down

604
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:30,336

605

608
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:39,808
In finance website there are heroes Nick talking about

609
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:41,856
The horrors that will happen

610
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:44,160
How because of this idea of

611
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:45,440
Possibly updating

618
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,400
Probably not

619
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:56,704
Maybe nothing

620
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,240
Before the 21st century

621
00:28:58,496 --> 00:28:59,520
How long before they

622
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:00,288
They say that

623
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:03,872
Anything before Barack Obama is the new Confederate flag

624
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:06,176
Anything before Barack Obama

625
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:06,944
Is the new Jeff

Before Juneteenth becoming a national holiday

630
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:17,952
June 19th 2021 is our new ended

632
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:23,840
That seemed

633
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,120
Used to be where all of the

634
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:27,424

636
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,472
Me

637
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:30,496
And and

You're a young Western Christian identity as a nation

644
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:43,808
At least people

645
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,600
Trying to destroy that in

646
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:46,624
Replace it with a

Racism

660
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:10,688
Identity isn't real and we all

661
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:13,504
Build a new country on

662
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:16,320
The fact that we buy Nike and we listen

Holyshit

665
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,720
That was an

666
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:29,120
Astonishing amount of racism compacted into a very short. Of time

667
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:30,656
It is I mean

668
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:34,496
These conversation

669
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:36,032
And stuff like this is

670
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:40,640
Start unfamiliar to places like Stormfront

671
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:44,224
This is this is what's on Alex's site

672
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:49,344
Straight up

673
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,160
I've realized I think this is what I've learned

674
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,952
Is that there's just no way to talk to

675
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:54,720
Do people like

676
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,048
Text Nick Fuentes

677
00:30:58,304 --> 00:30:59,328
What we got to do

678
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,864
All right here's my new play

679
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:02,656
Cesar Millan

680
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:07,520
Alright when whenever somebody's nearby and he's like saying some racist s*** you just

681
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:15,712
Until he stops and then whatever little training treats like you got to do it the old-fashioned

682
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:16,992
Skinner

683
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:21,088
Straight up behavior modification

684
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:21,856
It's the only way

685
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:24,928
I think that

686
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:37,728
What you just said will be interpreted by someone like Nick as being like I want to put us in camps

687
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:39,264
I mean

688
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,056
I just think I would have put you in a dog

689
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:43,872
Alright

690
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:45,920
This is Jordan's opinion

691
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:49,248
So I think I was watching that as a guy

692
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:50,016
Is pretty

693
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:52,576
I made this is it this is a distortion of

694
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:54,624
What was

695
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,648
Spell being

696
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:58,976
Sad in the op-ed

697
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:02,560
That's being used specifically for the reasons of being able to create this

698
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:03,840
Backlash arguing

699
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:08,704
A distortion that turns into wholesale fabric

700
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,984
Location on top of that

701
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,056
I thought this was this was pretty bad

702
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:14,080
Just like as a first

703
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:14,848
Vale

704
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:18,944
What else is going on over here on the old

705
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,480
Winters Channel

706
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:22,784
And then I saw this video that

707
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,808
It's a

708
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:24,832
Screenshot of it

709
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:25,856
The image

710
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:27,648

711
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:28,416

These people are not a merry

716
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:40,192
And the title the video

717
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,240
They wake up

718
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:46,336
The Holocaust religion is antithetical to America first

719
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:55,040
All I got for that

720
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:58,368
These people are not them

Weeping and apologize

724
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:03,744
Sing about the hollow

725
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:07,072
The Holocaust happen on another continent

726
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:13,728
There's a genocide problem and no one even cares

727
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:16,032
And you think that's an exaggeration

728
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:18,848
Marjorie Taylor Greene was called out

729
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:20,384

730
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,664
Washing mandates of the Holocaust

731
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:23,456
Do you think it's a little bit

732
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:25,248
Copper bowl that today in America

733
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,552

739
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:33,696
No

740
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:34,976
You call your bank

741
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:36,000

00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,376
For self-employed people

745
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,168
And they'll tell you

746
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,192
You're white

747
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:45,984
You're not eligible to apply youth

748
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,264
I think that's a little similar

749
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:50,592
You think if you're a farmer or restaurant owner and you call up your bank

750
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:52,128
How to apply for

751
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:53,920
Does the government

752
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:54,688
The economy

753
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:55,968
And they say

754
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:56,992
You're not eligible to

755
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:58,016
To apply because your wife

756
00:33:58,784 --> 00:33:59,552
A little bit the same

757
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:01,344
I was unaware that white people couldn't

758
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,624
Get covid stimulus money

759
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,928
Actually no many white people

760
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:05,952
Some individuals

761
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:06,976
Susan's in some small business

762
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:08,000
Sounders

763
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:13,120
We did get the alone to the stimulus money back

764
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:18,240
I tried to look into this a little bit I found a couple of stories a kind of or the opposite

765
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:19,008
What makes

766
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:20,288
Talking about

767
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:24,384
LA Times reported in April 2020 that US citizens who are immigrants

768
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,432
Send are married to non-citizens worse

769
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,200
Specifically

770
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:29,248
Excluded from Trump's Financial relief package

771
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:33,856
That's a cupboard over 1 million citizens

772
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:35,904
For cut-out I was going to say

773
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,440
My problem with Nick

774
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:38,720
First

775
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:40,000
Thought that white people

776
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:41,280
Can't get it is that

777
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:44,608
It is mathematically impossible but the mat

778
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:47,680
Vast majority of those funds did not go to

779
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:49,472
I'm saying like

780
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:51,008
The vast majority went

781
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:52,032
Two white people

782
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:58,432
What make is talking about was a provision of the covid relief bill that provided 5 billion dollars in relief to quote disadvantage

783
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:00,992
Farmers approximately a quarter of whom are black

784
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,784
From an article in the Washington Post

785
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:09,696
Farmers in America have lost more than 12 million Acres of Farmland over the past Century mostly since the 1950s

786
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:12,512
A result of what agricultural experts and advocates

787
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:14,304
It's for black farmer say the combination

788
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,584
Systemic racism

789
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,400
Bias government policy and social and business

790
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:19,168
Practices but if

791
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:20,704
Denied African Americans

792
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,240
Equitable access to Market

793
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,776
Yeah the farm version of red

794
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:28,384
Discrimination started a century ago with a series of federal Homestead Act

795
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,712
Text that offered mainly white settlers deeply subsidized lamp

796
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:35,296
Local US Department of Agriculture offices

797
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:36,064
Charged with

798
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,904
Distributing loan to frequently been found to deny black Farmers access to credit

799
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,208
And to ignore or delay loan application

800
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:48,352
Many black Farmers don't have clear title to their land which makes them ineligible for certain USDA loan

801
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,632
To purchase livestock

802
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:51,168
Or cover the cost of planting

803
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:53,984
And they are seldom benefited from subsidy payment

804
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,264
Mentor trade mitigation

805
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:56,288
Asian

806
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:58,336
Almost all of President Donald Trump's

807
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:02,176
28 billion dollar bailout for those affected by the China trade War

808
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:03,456
Went to White farmers

809
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:07,040
According to the assessment they cite the average white farmer received

810
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:08,832
$3,398 from

811
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:11,136
Drops bail out while the average black Pharmacy

812
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:12,928
22

813
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:16,256
Affect

814
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:22,656
There's a larger problem regarding how independent agriculture is treated in this country regardless of

815
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:24,448
And that's something that we do have

816
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:26,240
Absolutely after work on but it's also

817
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:30,080
Completely absurd to look at the history of black farming in America and not recognized

818
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:31,872
Concerted attempt

819
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:34,176
Apps to exclude black people from having access to

820
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:35,968
And participating in that market

821
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:37,504
You can be against

822
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,040
This if you want

823
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:41,344
Isn't it clearly does want but

824
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,368
To frame opposition

825
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:44,160
The provision of the covid relief bill

826
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:46,976
White people are being genocided cuz they can't get covid

827
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:47,744
Would stimulus

828
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,024
That's a little bit much

829
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,864
Considering this is also just a five billion dollar provision in a 1.9

830
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,144
Million-dollar bill

831
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:57,728
I don't know I don't know

832
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:59,520
Something else we're all like

833
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:00,544
People couldn't get covid

834
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:01,568
Brooklyn

835
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:03,360
They don't know what that is though

836
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:04,384
I know that this was a big

837
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,152
Big talking point

838
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:06,176
Amongst his

839
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,712
Community proud

840
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:10,016
Yeah I really despise

841
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:11,808
I really despise that the piece

842
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:13,088
People most obsessed

843
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:13,856
Messed with

844
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:16,160
Portraying themselves as like

845
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:16,928
Self

846
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:18,976
Sustaining

847
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,768
F******

848
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,816
Amazing individualist

849
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:25,888
Only ever seem to follow whiny cowards

850
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:27,168
To pick the tiniest

851
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:27,936
Bulshit

852
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:29,728
Then tell them that every Vic

853
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:31,776
Victimization that they've ever imagined is true

854
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:34,080
And they're all a bunch of morons and I hate it

855
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,384
I hate it

856
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,408
It's infuriating

857
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:39,200
And I think you're going to have a real bus time

858
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:39,968
With us

859
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:42,016
The rest of the stuff we talked about

860
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:44,320
Might be a good idea

861
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:50,720
This might be an instance of an episode where it's all Mike down

862
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,584
No Interruption overhead Eclipse I feel like an eruption

863
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,376
But from afar

864
00:37:58,144 --> 00:38:04,288
Is I'm pretty sure you're going to yell over a lot of them and I would like to present Nick in his own words

865
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:05,568
Cuz I don't want to

866
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:10,432
I don't want to show like a distorted version of Alex yelling over Brian stelter show

867
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:19,136
You and I'm not saying this is a failing on your part I don't know I don't know if you'd be able to stop yourself

868
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:25,536
Be heard no matter where is the microphone in this room may be a little bit away from you is all I'm saying because

869
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:27,072
We are about to get it too

870
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:29,120
Oh my God Mass

871
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:30,400
How is this possible

872
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:33,728
So Nick put out a video that is

873
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,800
Real emotional music

874
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:37,824
Behind it

875
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,616
And it is a pulley

876
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:41,408
About how the system

877
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:42,176
I hate to White

878
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:47,552
Super 8

879
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,600
The system of my heart

880
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:50,624
The system

881
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:52,416
You just got understand

882
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:56,256
Okay so here's where we're going to begin on this

883
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:58,304
Very little

884
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,120
From this the 7 Minute report

885
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,680
A couple of little

886
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:05,472
B I did but they were worried

887
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:09,056
Here's the beginning and

888
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:09,824
Oh boy

889
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:12,640
Lexus

890
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:13,408
Call what it is

891
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,248
The system

892
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:18,016
Paige White

893
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:20,064
I just wanted it

894
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:21,856
Everybody wants

895
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:22,880
To call it every

896
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:24,160
Other than that

897
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:25,440
They want to call it ever

898
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,720
Everything other than what it is

899
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:29,536
You may hear conservative talk about

900
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:30,560
Call TruMark

901
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,608
Critical race

902
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:33,888
That's the new one

903
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:35,424
Critical race Theory

904
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:36,448
Trt

905
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:38,752
And critical race theory has

906
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:40,032
Marxist origin

907
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:43,360
Is socialism is communism

908
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:45,408
It's anti-western

909
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:47,712
Western Civilization

910
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:51,040
Conservatives even will call it anything other

911
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:51,808
Then what it is

912
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:52,832
Because

913
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,880
It's not politically correct

914
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:55,648
To say what

915
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,208
You can order it in polite Society

916
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:00,256
What is its ratio

917
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:02,816
It's racial hatred

918
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:04,352
They hate white people

919
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:05,888
This little boy

920
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:07,424
Cash Garden was

921
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,448
Murdered

922
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:09,984
Dragged out of his bad

923
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:12,288
The middle the night in his home

924
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,384
In murdered outside his house in the street by a black man

925
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,432
Because he was white

926
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:21,504
That black guy killed a white boy

927
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,320
Because he was white and black I hated white p

928
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:25,600
People that's why he did it

929
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:32,256
It wasn't acting Patron it wasn't random it was an act of racial hatred perpetrated by a black man

930
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:38,400
And why is everybody so afraid to call it that of course that's what it is

931
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:40,192
There's one really important

932
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:40,960
Anything that needs

933
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:42,240
To be kept in mind

934
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:45,056
Entirely as we discussed

935
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,104
Situation in that is

936
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,896
That this case is pretty Reese

937
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:53,760
At this point there is a suspect has been arrested and charged but he's not been found guilty

938
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:58,368
Well it may very well turn out to be the case that this eighteen-year-old Derren Brown

939
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:00,416
Gilda's four-year-old child

940
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:02,720
Nick Fuentes is making a lot of assumptions

941
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:03,744
Circumstance

942
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:05,536
In order to make this child today

943
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:06,304
Death

944
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,096
And emotionally resonant centerpiece

945
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:10,144
For his white identity propaganda

946
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:12,960
Woman taking care of the

947
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:13,728
The child

948
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:16,288
The circumstance here is basically that

949
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,568
The woman

950
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:19,104
I was the girlfriend

951
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,896
Of the child parent

952
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:22,176
And the child's parents

953
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:24,992
Father had

954
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,528
Yeah town

955
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:28,832
Okay and so she was taking care of the kid

956
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:29,856
Okay at the time

957
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:33,696
This woman she identified Brown

958
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:37,024
From a surveillance footage of the child being taken from

959
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:37,792
Is crab

960
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:39,072
And tachinu

961
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:41,888
Brown was friends with her son

962
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,728
Additionally police have stated that sunglasses shoes and hoodie

963
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:46,752
That were taken

964
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:47,776
A brown after a search

965
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:49,824
Tested positive for child's blood

966
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:53,407
So it does look like there's a decent case coming together today keep made

967
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:54,431
AP Celtic short

968
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:57,503
I Court will determine what it determined

969
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,295
But the case is being built

970
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:00,063
Sure

971
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:00,831
That's it

972
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:03,135
Even if you are to break with the American

973
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:03,903
Tradition

974
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:05,183
Nick loves America

975
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:09,023
You break with that tradition of presuming innocence until Court

976
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:10,303
Find someone guilty

977
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:11,071
You decide

978
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:12,863
He is definitely the murderer

979
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,911
It's still super unfair the way maker

980
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:15,935
Is presenting this case

981
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:21,311
Mickey Singh the brown killed his four-year-old child because the child was white and that he hated wifey

982
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,871
I've read a number of pieces about this case

983
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:26,431
And I don't know where Nick could possibly be getting that

984
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:27,199
That from

985
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:31,039
What seems much more likely is the Derren Brown is somebody who is experiencing

986
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:33,855
Terrifying and awful mental disturb

987
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:41,279
In February of this year Brown was also alleged to have broken into another home nearby and appeared to be in the middle of a burglary

988
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:42,815
When he was confronted by the homeowner

989
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:45,887
They got into a quarrel and brown was removed from the house

990
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:49,215
Re-entered and attempted to take the man's

991
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:50,495
2 year old granddaughter

992
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:56,383
The grandfather fought Brown off and protected the young child but decided not to press charges at that time

993
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:58,431
CBS article about the sea

994
00:42:58,687 --> 00:42:59,455
Situation quote

995
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:02,783
Two weeks after the incident the man ran into Brown at Walmart

996
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:07,647
He told police the brown approached him and apologized saying he was sorry for breaking into his house

997
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:09,183
And trying to take his grandchild

998
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:11,487
Additionally another name

999
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:14,303
Neighbor Jose Alvarado decided to check his

1000
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:17,119
Security cameras after the murder to see if he could find any

1001
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:21,215
10 weeks prior to the murder he found video of brown quotes

1002
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:22,495
Skulking down the street

1003
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:25,311
Opening Alvarado's backyard gate and

1004
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:27,359
Appearing in before quickly walking away

1005
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:29,663
Alvarado has multiple Young

1006
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:33,247
Brown's mother has also stated that he's a patient at an adult

1007
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:34,015
Treatment Center

1008
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:35,807
And there have been some speculation

1009
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:37,343
That he may be

1010
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:41,183
All the details of the story are absent

1011
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:42,207
From Nicks version

1012
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:43,231
End of it because

1013
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:45,791
Those are indications that maybe there's more to this case

1014
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:49,375
Then just a matter of relative skin colors of victim in alleged

1015
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:50,399
Perpetrator

1016
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:52,959
Nikki doesn't want to tell people about the multiple other in

1017
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:55,007
Instances in the neighborhood of brown appearing to be

1018
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:55,775
Be trying to take

1019
00:43:56,031 --> 00:44:00,639
Children because it would overcomplicate the story and make it no longer useful for him to use as a prop

1020
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:01,663
City Meats

1021
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:03,711
To justify his white identity anger

1022
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:05,247
And that anger is

1023
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:08,063
He's felt long before this case ever came along

1024
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:10,879
I'm all for humanizing victims of crime

1025
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:12,671
Times and I think that what happened here is it

1026
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:14,207
The complete unqualified tragic

1027
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:19,327
From all available evidence I just don't see any support for the version of the story that Nick is telling

1028
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:21,887
Where this is a racially-motivated crime

1029
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:28,287
By insisting that this crime is motivated by racial hate towards white people from black people what Nick is attempting to do

1030
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:29,311
His take the adjuster

1031
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:33,151
Certifiable and understandable emotional reaction that a listener might have

1032
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:34,431
The hearing about this case

1033
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:39,551
He wants to transform that into anger at black people and a defensiveness about being white

1034
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:43,903
He's effectively trying to use this child's death is fuel for his racism machine

1035
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:44,927
Which I find repulse

1036
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:49,791
What are the main points I want to make your is that all the information that I reviewed

1037
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:53,631
I can find no indication that would lead me to make the assumption that Nick is making

1038
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:54,655
Sing about the motive of

1039
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:55,423
This case

1040
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:57,983
Articles often even include a comment from

1041
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:00,799
The son of the woman who was watching

1042
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:01,823
A child at the time

1043
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:03,359
Cameron also went

1044
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:05,407
To school with brown they were they went to the

1045
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:07,711
I was saying I think there was even the same age

1046
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:11,295
Cameron was asked about a possible motive and he said quote

1047
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:12,319
Random yes

1048
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:14,623
Random out of nowhere for no reason

1049
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:16,159
There's no reason for none of the

1050
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:17,951
It's not from Revenge not for

1051
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:19,487
From hate not from none of that

1052
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:20,255
Nothing

1053
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:21,279
To get back at us

1054
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:22,047
Nothing

1055
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:26,399
Directly indications in the Articles and primary services from people involved in

1056
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:27,679
In the situation that they don't

1057
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:29,471
That it was crying motivated by hate

1058
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:32,799
But this is the exact opposite of the story is reported by Nick selentis

1059
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:35,615
Because the reality is the Nick doesn't care about the

1060
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:36,383
The story at all

1061
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:37,663
Outside of how we can use it

1062
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:38,431
The push is Worlds

1063
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:43,551
He doesn't care about this child or his family he doesn't care about any of the pain that anyone involved

1064
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:44,319
This feeling

1065
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:49,439
That's just a facade that Nick puts on in order to give his bigotry some plausible deniability

1066
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:50,975
And make it acceptable to behave

1067
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:53,023
Yeah I wrote

1068
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:53,791
This is

1069
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:54,559
It's fun

1070
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:56,095
F***** up and it's an assault

1071
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:58,399
It's an assault in the sense that

1072
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:00,191
The way that I'm

1073
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:02,751
But the way that you interact with the story if

1074
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:04,799
If you are at all a

1075
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:05,567
Empathetic purse

1076
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:06,591
Is 2

1077
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:07,615
Hear the story

1078
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:09,407
Feel nothing but heart

1079
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:11,199
For everyone involved Terror

1080
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:15,295
It's just absolutely nightmarish end for somebody with a mental illness

1081
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:16,063
Is that that

1082
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:17,855
Other Terror of like

1083
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:19,391
There but for the grace

1084
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:20,415
You know what I'm saying

1085
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:21,439
But

1086
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:23,743
Whenever Nick Fuentes gets involved

1087
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:25,535
You can't

1088
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:27,071
Experience that MP

1089
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:28,095
He blocks

1090
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:30,143
Forcing you to feel nothing but

1091
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:33,215
Rage either at something or at

1092
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:36,031
Him it is like if you are wonderful

1093
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:39,871
If it's like it's like if you're wondering up to somebody who is bleeding out on the

1094
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:40,895
The f****** ground

1095
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:44,991
And then you have somebody just barge in and tell you why it's okay for them to be

1096
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:49,343
Be dying and you don't have time to help that person out because you're too busy trying to

1097
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:52,927
The fight off have f****** awful this person is trying to kill them

1098
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:57,279
That's a fascinating thought and I guess I kind of that kind of gets into like

1099
00:46:58,047 --> 00:47:00,095
I guess a little bit of the difference in our react

1100
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:01,631
You know because

1101
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:05,727
Get that anger at Nick I mean I understand it

1102
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:09,311
But that's not my immediate reaction

1103
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:12,127
See what the details are understand

1104
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:13,151
I I think that there

1105
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:16,479
I think a lot of people probably to respond the same way that you're talkin

1106
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:21,087
I'm about probably why you act like such a big troll is to elicit that angry response

1107
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:24,159
That's at does not allow you to deal with the reality of this

1108
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:27,231
Situation to discover can't go I can't do any good

1109
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:32,351
All I can do is feel Fury at this human being that is exploiting people who I also

1110
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:33,119
Can't help

1111
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:39,519
And just feel rage about it it doesn't help anybody do anything and it's simply an assault on everyone who listens

1112
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:41,055
It is an assault

1113
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:42,591
And that's what that's what

1114
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:45,407
Drives me so insane we're talkin about like

1115
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:48,223
Illegality and freedom of speech and all that s***

1116
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:50,271
This is an absolute

1117
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:51,039
F******

1118
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:52,063
Override

1119
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:55,391
Yeah maybe that

1120
00:47:56,671 --> 00:48:00,255
Maybe that's the lesson or something that's good

1121
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:01,791
That is okay too

1122
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:03,839
Feel but in a minute abs

1123
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:05,631
Its meaning

1124
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:08,703
Playing into the hands of the people

1125
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:09,727
Like Nick Fuentes

1126
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:10,751
If all you do is

1127
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:12,287
Is feel like a girl

1128
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:16,127
You at him or whatever you can't help that person who's Bleeding Out

1129
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:17,151
All I have is

1130
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:18,175
Miss Fury

1131
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:19,967
Hey there Denise

1132
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:23,039
To be like a recognition of not a not a

1133
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:24,575
You can't

1134
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:28,159
Feel bad at yourself because you're angry at them

1135
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:35,583
Is there needs to be another layer to it and that brings you to a resentment like my first reaction to him.

1136
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:37,119
Talking about the story is that I

1137
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:38,911
Can't allow myself to

1138
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:39,679
To feel that

1139
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:40,447
Full open

1140
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:41,983
An empathy towards the

1141
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:42,751
Check to his story

1142
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:44,031
Cuz if I do

1143
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:44,799
That's History

1144
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:47,359
You know and so my reaction to that of course is

1145
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:48,127
Fury

1146
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:51,199
Because you're taking away my ability to even be a human

1147
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:53,759
You're forcing me to focus on your boat

1148
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:56,319
And then I feel resentment that

1149
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:57,855
Doing being angry

1150
00:48:58,111 --> 00:48:59,391
This anger doesn't

1151
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:03,743
Solve any doesn't help us it doesn't help him it doesn't help the person is suffering

1152
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:06,047
It's a f****** a song

1153
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:11,679
Goes on I'm doing great I'm going to put my bike down for the next 2 or 3 hours

1154
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:13,215
Sounds good sounds good

1155
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:16,543
So why the saddest video guy continues

1156
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:17,311
Very

1157
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:19,359
Dramatic music

1158
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:26,271
What is been engendered in the population for the past two years what's the population for the past

1159
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:32,671
30 years older than anti-white hatred what are people learning in the school

1160
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:38,303
Would you go to grade school can you go to American history class what do you learn about

1161
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:40,607
Howard Zinn curriculum

1162
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:42,399
You learn about how

1163
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:49,055
White people genocided the indigenous Americans white people enslave black people and

1164
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:55,455
Brought them over here once freed by Whites Whites mistreated blacks by being racist

1165
00:49:57,759 --> 00:50:03,903
Plan segregated making them drinking we are about how

1166
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:09,023
White supremacist Nazis try to take over the whole world

1167
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:13,887
Weather fascist ideology in WWII with Adolf Hitler

1168
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:14,655
Real quick

1169
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:18,239
So far this is just a list of things that are

1170
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:19,263
Grill

1171
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:22,591
And it's not like

1172
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:24,127
In school that

1173
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:26,687
Oh you know you also learned other

1174
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:31,295
All

1175
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:35,391
His argument is people always always only talk about how bad why people are

1176
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:38,975
Why don't we get rid of that part into talk about great white people are

1177
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:40,255
I guess

1178
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:47,423
Aryan it's because they were white supremacist because they

1179
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:53,823
They believe they perpetrated the Holocaust

1180
00:50:54,079 --> 00:51:00,223
And that was by far and away the most have seen worst genocide ever in the history of the world

1181
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:06,623
And then what all was said and done white people racist to the Muslims that blew up the World Trade Center

1182
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:13,791
Are racist to black criminals in the police basically people are bred from cradle until Ray

1183
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:17,887
Thinking that white people are uniquely evil people

1184
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:23,263
White people there a special guilt for all the problems of his country

1185
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:25,311
All the problems

1186
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:31,711
And really like all the problems of humanity like legitimately indistinguishable from like white

1187
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:34,015
Us propaganda that was coming out like

1188
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:36,575
10 years ago

1189
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:37,855
This is

1190
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:40,415
Identical to videos

1191
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:41,439
That you would see

1192
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:42,207
From like

1193
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:46,047
White is Right groups

1194
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:47,583
Like 50 donut

1195
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:48,607
Yeah that is

1196
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:50,655
I also just that f******

1197
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:52,959
From when they're very young

1198
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:55,263
The kids are white

1199
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:56,287
People are bad

1200
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:58,335
I just want him to follow that up with

1201
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:00,639
And I'm here to prove their right

1202
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:04,479
Listen

1203
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:05,759
Here is all the stuff White

1204
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:06,527
People and the fact

1205
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:08,063
That he said

1206
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:09,599
That he said this is the

1207
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:11,135
Sequence of events

1208
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:12,159
Is

1209
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:14,719
Black people were enslaved White

1210
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:16,255
People freed them

1211
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:17,535
Then why

1212
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:19,327
People started to treat them poorly

1213
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:26,239
That was it and then it's an interesting that chain of events

1214
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:27,775
Interesting.

1215
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:32,895
So this goes on

1216
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:33,919
Unfortunately

1217
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:40,831
And it's as a consequence of these things are becoming more and more common

1218
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:47,231
White people are being dehumanized and when white people are Geminis black people are going

1219
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:53,631
People because they see them as less than human and other people are going to start killing

1220
00:52:53,887 --> 00:53:00,031
How much do you want to bet that this song whatever his name is Dara

1221
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:06,431
Brown whatever was radicalized by the meeting up into thinking that white people are racist

1222
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:12,831
Responsible for his suffering

1223
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:19,231
And then he committed this crime in retaliation for that perceived Prejudice precedes hatred against him

1224
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:25,631
That's the consequence of all this anti-white hatred and dehumanization the media education system

1225
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:32,031
And it's even tried in the lot systematically through the government and what do you think affirmative action is

1226
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:34,335
So Nick is just making up

1227
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:36,895
Details circumstances motives

1228
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:37,919
For this

1229
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:39,199
It's murder and

1230
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:41,503
Using those assumptions

1231
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:42,527
Has Justin

1232
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:43,295
Application

1233
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:45,599
Like a proves his

1234
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:47,135
Why people are being to humanize

1235
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:48,415
P

1236
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:52,511
This is nonsense

1237
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:54,559
I do love

1238
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:56,351
Full and

1239
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:58,399
Complete admission that

1240
00:53:58,655 --> 00:54:00,959
They are aware of what they're doing

1241
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:02,751
And are doing it on purpose

1242
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:04,287
Just that like

1243
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:10,175
Black people are trying to dehumanize white people and when you dehumanize a group of people

1244
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:11,967
They start getting killed

1245
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:17,855
Immediately after being like Oh everybody cares about the Holocaust like it's a big to you

1246
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:19,903
I f****** hate him

1247
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:23,999
I hate him so much that I don't think he was aware of

1248
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:27,327
Nick Warren

1249
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:30,399
Is it because they said the humanization against white people as having

1250
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:31,935
Give me a problem

1251
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:32,959
When

1252
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:34,751
This country is no longer White

1253
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:41,919
But here's the problem this is not going to be a white country forever and it's not going to

1254
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:48,319
For very much longer in a lot of places it already isn't

1255
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:54,719
And in a lot of ways it already is it to white country more and is the percentage and proportion of

1256
00:54:54,975 --> 00:55:01,119
White people to finishes in America relative to non-white people it's going to become more and more of a

1257
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:07,007
Problem for white people that non-white people don't like it it's just that simple

1258
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:08,031
Pink

1259
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:12,895
White and non-white people largely don't like

1260
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:14,431
Why people like Nick

1261
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:19,295
Is everything to do with

1262
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:20,575
Position

1263
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:21,855
His beliefs

1264
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:23,647
Better rapport

1265
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:30,303
This goes back to a few conversations that I've had with the terrible comedians in the circle of The Joe Rogan

1266
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:31,071
Haha

1267
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:32,607
Kind of thing where

1268
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:34,399
Ultimately like what he

1269
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:36,447
He's really boiling this down to

1270
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:37,727
Is

1271
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:39,519
A theory that he's not going

1272
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:41,311
And he doesn't want to say

1273
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:42,591
Straight out

1274
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:44,127
Basically

1275
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:46,175
White people

1276
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:47,967
We kind of have it coming

1277
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:49,759
And if they have the numbers

1278
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:50,527
They'll do what

1279
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:52,319
We would do in this situation

1280
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:53,343
Which is Caleb

1281
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:59,999
Ultimate logic of light us if we are at any moment event

1282
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:02,815
One of Nick's primary political

1283
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:03,839
Motivation

1284
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:08,703
Isn't one of the things that is like a prime primary goal

1285
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:10,751
White majority

1286
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:13,311
Overall levers of power

1287
00:56:13,823 --> 00:56:17,407
Because he thinks like I do as soon as

1288
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:23,807
We're going to do what I would want to do

1289
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:26,367
They've kind of actually have internalized all the

1290
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:28,671
The guilt that they're blaming other people for

1291
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:29,951
I'm recognizing that

1292
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:30,719
You know what

1293
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:36,607
White people make up a little bit coming their way I feel like that is something behind it

1294
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:38,399
Is politics so much like

1295
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:39,423
It's it's

1296
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:43,775
If I guess he's complaining about the education system in critical race Theory

1297
00:56:44,031 --> 00:56:47,359
He's just listing all the things that white people have done that are evil

1298
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:49,407
And he's not even bringing up like

1299
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:51,711
And here's how to balance that out

1300
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:55,807
He's not doing that all he's just throwing the great replacement Theory out it

1301
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:57,343
With the underpinning that

1302
00:56:57,855 --> 00:57:03,999
White people are genocide of monsters who maybe have some coming their way like that's his that's his understand

1303
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:07,839
He's also a mean

1304
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:09,119
Resent is like

1305
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:13,471
Notion

1306
00:57:13,727 --> 00:57:14,495
I call you learning

1307
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:16,031
And school is these negative things

1308
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:17,055
About white people

1309
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:19,359
Anybody who makes that point

1310
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:24,479
Is willfully ignoring all of these very positively to learn about

1311
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:27,807
And all the negative things you learn about other cultures

1312
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:30,111
You know you learn

1313
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:31,391
Old sorts of things

1314
00:57:31,647 --> 00:57:37,791
It's cool if you actually do the reading remember all too often

1315
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:44,191
My elementary school history books hearing Barbarian apply to United States citizens

1316
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:45,983
Yeah it's the same

1317
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:46,751
Kind of

1318
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:48,287
Thinking that leads you to be like

1319
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:53,151
Uc-one Gillette commercial with a interracial couple

1320
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:56,479
Why are they trying to push this on me there is

1321
00:57:56,735 --> 00:57:59,551
He's bitter in every commercial

1322
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:01,599
Did selective

1323
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:03,391
Attention

1324
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:09,791
And they definitely don't put in all the times that white people are propped up and told about how great white people are whenever

1325
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:13,375
The real history you look a little bit further into it and it's like

1326
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:16,447
All the work was done by

1327
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:19,775
Video ends

1328
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:26,943
The media attacks white they say that white people caused the suffering of non-white

1329
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:33,343
People don't like white people nobody talks about increasingly know that non-white people

1330
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:39,743
Largely Ricard white people with fishing distrust in some cases just don't like to pay them nobody wants to say that

1331
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:46,143
You are very comfortable talking about racism against blacks or other non-white but nobody talks about the

1332
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:52,543
The distrust nobody talks about the resentment that non-white people have for white people in the country

1333
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:58,943
Everybody but it is a lot of people and everyone knows that as the population becomes

1334
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:05,343
Less and less white as the people in charge of the country and the people enforcing the law

1335
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:11,743
Positive people the country they charge of the country become less and less white that's going to matter a lot

1336
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:21,727
These are not foreign ideas to the rhetoric that Alex uses it's just way more eclipse

1337
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:23,263
Said it is over

1338
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:24,287
Hey you saying

1339
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:26,335
The parts that Alex likes

1340
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:27,359
Obscure way

1341
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:29,663
Yeah this is not the quiet part loud this is

1342
00:59:29,919 --> 00:59:35,551
This is the quiet part scream through a bullhorn on top of a f****** Mountain yeah

1343
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:36,575
For sure

1344
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:37,343
Wow

1345
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:38,623
Nick

1346
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:42,463
Posted also on here on this on this band. Video page of his

1347
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:45,535
They posted a video a little clip

1348
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:50,655
Of him giving a speech at the America First political action conference

1349
00:59:50,911 --> 00:59:51,935
It's so funny

1350
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:53,727
Because in the real world

1351
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:55,775
If you heard a video like that

1352
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:58,847
You don't hear about a follow-up video it's not like

1353
00:59:59,103 --> 01:00:03,967
Like this would be like if this is immediately after Michael Richard then we were done discussing that clip in your life

1354
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:08,831
All right so the next night he was back at the laboratory booked again

1355
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:11,647
Yeah

1356
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:15,231
Yep cancel culture is out of control

1357
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:19,071
Control control videos and giving a speech

1358
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:22,143
Play this

1359
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:23,679
Entire clip and it's

1360
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:24,703
If its totality

1361
01:00:25,215 --> 01:00:26,751
Is a two-minute clip that he posted

1362
01:00:27,007 --> 01:00:29,823
Titled we are the American

1363
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:32,127
This is terrifying

1364
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:33,151
Like

1365
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:39,551
This is what him might as well

1366
01:00:43,903 --> 01:00:44,415
America

1367
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:46,975
Is a party

1368
01:00:47,231 --> 01:00:47,743
Secular

1369
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:49,279
Particular

1370
01:00:57,983 --> 01:01:00,031
We are the American

1371
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:03,103
In America is the home of the American

1372
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:04,383
That's what I mean

1373
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:06,175
America

1374
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:08,735
America is

1375
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:09,759
1 people

1376
01:01:10,015 --> 01:01:10,783
One nation

1377
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:12,575
Discontent

1378
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:14,367
Forge

1379
01:01:14,623 --> 01:01:17,183
Over hundreds of years by shared experiences

1380
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:18,719
Descendants

1381
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:19,487
From

1382
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:21,023

Cultural framework

1384
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:23,583
And influenced by

1385
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:24,351
European

1386
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:25,375
Civilization

1387
01:01:34,335 --> 01:01:34,847
America

Christian Nation

1389
01:01:56,863 --> 01:02:03,007
And that's not just a slogan when I say that America is a Christian Nation

1390
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:03,775
I'm saying

1391
01:02:04,031 --> 01:02:10,175
That Jesus Christ is the Son of God and this is one nation under that guy

1392
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:24,511
America ceases to

1393
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:28,351
If America ceases

1394
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:29,887
To retain

1395
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:31,935
That English cultural framework

1396
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:34,239
And the influence of Europe

1397
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:37,311
Loses

1398
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:40,127
Demographic

1399
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:42,687
And if it loses

1400
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:44,479
Space in Jesus Christ

1401
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:46,271
Is not

1402
01:02:46,527 --> 01:02:47,807
America anymore

1403
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:52,927
That is about

1404
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:54,719
In terms of making

1405
01:02:55,487 --> 01:02:57,791
Orefield

1406
01:02:58,047 --> 01:03:00,095
Speech Where You Are advocating

1407
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:01,119
M4a

1408
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:02,143
White

1409
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:03,679
Ethnostate

1410
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:05,215
That is a theocracy

1411
01:03:08,031 --> 01:03:12,127
She can't you can't you can't Henry Ford

1412
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:15,199
I think somebody's really been going back to those

1413
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:17,247
Sweet old days of

1414
01:03:17,503 --> 01:03:23,391
Why Don't We join the Nazis come on where they're good people were good people parentheses White

1415
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:26,463
And it's great person interesting

1416
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:28,767
Things that I wrestle with

1417
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:31,583
As I as I was sort of watching these videos and I was like

1418
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:34,143
How much of this is Alex aware of

1419
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:35,935
And how much of this is just like

1420
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:37,983
I don't f****** care Nick popular

1421
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:41,055
Put this videos up I don't know it

1422
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:41,823
It's it's

1423
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:43,103
It seems like

1424
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:45,407
If I were him I would think this is bad for business

1425
01:03:45,919 --> 01:03:47,199
It's a little too over

1426
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:48,479
Scnow

1427
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:53,087
This is kind of Harrison was doing that ship to my vibe on this is

1428
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:54,111
Is this is Alex

1429
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:58,207
Fully dipping that toe into like Ana I so if

1430
01:03:58,463 --> 01:03:59,231
Nick Fuentes

1431
01:03:59,487 --> 01:04:00,767
Is clearly trying to steal my audio

1432
01:04:01,023 --> 01:04:05,119
If there's one thing I do believe Alex is smart about it snowing

1433
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:06,655
People are stealing his money

1434
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:10,751
Yeah it'll at least some Elementary

1435
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:12,287
Assertive work with

1436
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:14,079
And Co-op thing

1437
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:16,895
It's it's looking like

1438
01:04:17,407 --> 01:04:19,455
To me that Alex is putting that stuff up to

1439
01:04:19,711 --> 01:04:20,479
2 gauge wire

1440
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:21,247
Cuz look sure

1441
01:04:21,503 --> 01:04:23,039
Owen and Harrison

1442
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:27,647
So let's get you what level of out now white supremacy will do for us

1443
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:30,975
Maybe we have a whole new wing of the show

1444
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:34,559
Yeah I mean I think that a while back

1445
01:04:34,815 --> 01:04:35,327
We had

1446
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:36,095
Sort of ascent

1447
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:37,375
That like

1448
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:40,447
Deplatforming has a decent chance of Alex

1449
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:42,495
Eventually just realizing f*** it

1450
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:43,519
Yeah suck it

1451
01:04:43,775 --> 01:04:44,799
Speak freely you bet

1452
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:47,359
Just us here know if

1453
01:04:47,615 --> 01:04:48,383
I don't know if

1454
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:50,687
This should be taken as a sign of that

1455
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:52,223
Put it feels like it could be

1456
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:52,991
It really does

1457
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:54,015
Because this is

1458
01:04:54,527 --> 01:04:55,295
This is a bit much

1459
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:57,599
And you think about like Okay so

1460
01:04:58,367 --> 01:04:58,879
In the day

1461
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:00,159
But in the

1462
01:05:00,415 --> 01:05:01,695
In the old Salad Days

1463
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:07,583
The 2017 we were young and fresh-faced do you have Alex Jones

1464
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:10,399
Put into a sew-in Shroyer

1465
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:12,447
This would not have

1466
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:16,031
Flown

1467
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:18,079
Here's what we do

1468
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:19,103
Deterioration

1469
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:19,871
Chords

1470
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:21,919
Alright

1471
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:24,223
Clear throated articulation

1472
01:05:24,735 --> 01:05:26,271
Of white nationalist position

1473
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:29,343
But I mean it's been if that's the

1474
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:30,367
That's America

1475
01:05:30,623 --> 01:05:32,159
Like as we've Alex's

1476
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:33,951
Is Alex's dominated the United

1477
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:36,767
I genuinely believe that

1478
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:38,559
At a certain Boyd Alex

1479
01:05:38,815 --> 01:05:39,327
Overtook

1480
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:40,095
Is is

1481
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:41,887
Why wasn't propaganda

1482
01:05:42,143 --> 01:05:43,423
No not really but that like

1483
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:45,215
Straight up

1484
01:05:45,727 --> 01:05:47,263
Conspiracy Laden

1485
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:49,311
White nationalist only

1486
01:05:49,823 --> 01:05:50,335
Is

1487
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:51,615
Absolutely

1488
01:05:52,127 --> 01:05:53,407
Just taking over that way

1489
01:05:54,687 --> 01:05:59,039
You know like though as we as we watched Alex go from having Jakari Jackson on his show

1490
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:00,319
2

1491
01:06:00,575 --> 01:06:03,647
Now where I'm pitching him a jhacari

1492
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:04,671
Nick Fuentes

1493
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:05,695
Double hander

1494
01:06:05,951 --> 01:06:07,487
We see how that goes

1495
01:06:07,999 --> 01:06:09,791
IMDb

1496
01:06:10,047 --> 01:06:10,815
So is the culture

1497
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:12,607
Largest done the same thing

1498
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:13,631
Yeah

1499
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:14,399
Bucked up

1500
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:15,679
Now that's f***** up

1501
01:06:16,191 --> 01:06:17,727
One last video of Nick

1502
01:06:17,983 --> 01:06:20,031
Oh God this one's about Pride parades

1503
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:23,615
Well I'm upright box

1504
01:06:24,383 --> 01:06:25,407
You know these people just

1505
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:26,175
Crystal Light

1506
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:27,967
In terrifying us with us

1507
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:32,319
I really think those are Christ is King Jesus

1508
01:06:32,575 --> 01:06:34,111
They love that s***.

1509
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:35,135
That's creepy

1510
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:36,671
The merging of

1511
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:38,207
Sort of

1512
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:39,231
Ethnic

1513
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:42,047
Demographic anxiety and anger

1514
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:45,119
The the hyper nationalism

1515
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:47,423
The Christian

1516
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:49,215
Extremism

1517
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:53,823
Very similar when Thomas Jefferson was talking about definitely doesn't

1518
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:55,871
Lead to bad out

1519
01:06:58,175 --> 01:07:02,015
Also Nick is a big old homophone

1520
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:08,671
Somebody giving a speech that whines up having a crisis cream King break

1521
01:07:08,927 --> 01:07:15,071
Beat like

1522
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:18,911
Yeah I would say that this video even surprised

1523
01:07:21,983 --> 01:07:23,775
It starts off with him

1524
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:24,543
Complaining that

1525
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:25,311
The country is being

1526
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:27,359
Clark hunt

1527
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:28,639
Being stolen from

1528
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:30,943
And that's not just rhetoric

1529
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:31,711
Our country

1530
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:36,831
Neighborhoods are play

1531
01:07:37,343 --> 01:07:37,855
The business

1532
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:38,879
Our economy

1533
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:40,927
Our sovereignty

1534
01:07:41,439 --> 01:07:41,951
Our country

1535
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:46,303
Azar's

1536
01:07:48,095 --> 01:07:48,863
Skip a long story

1537
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:51,423
And now it doesn't belong to us

1538
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:52,447
It belongs to

1539
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:53,215
The foreigners

1540
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:53,983
It belongs to

1541
01:07:55,007 --> 01:07:55,519
Hey.

1542
01:07:56,287 --> 01:07:56,799
Our country

1543
01:07:58,335 --> 01:07:59,359
Do not underestimate

1544
01:07:59,615 --> 01:08:00,127
Made what that mean

1545
01:08:01,663 --> 01:08:02,175
When it comes to the

1546
01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:02,943
Agenda

1547
01:08:03,967 --> 01:08:05,503
They would have if they

1548
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:06,783
Did all of you

1549
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:07,551
Children

1550
01:08:07,807 --> 01:08:08,575
Would be a doctor

1551
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:10,879
Transit J ideology

1552
01:08:11,647 --> 01:08:12,415
Think about a purse

1553
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:13,439
James younger

1554
01:08:14,207 --> 01:08:14,719
8 year old

1555
01:08:14,975 --> 01:08:15,999
Who is being

1556
01:08:16,255 --> 01:08:16,767
Horse

1557
01:08:17,023 --> 01:08:17,791
By his mother

1558
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:19,583
Potter the order of A4

1559
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:23,167
To undergo chemical castration with hormone replacement

1560
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:23,935
Therapy

1561
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:24,959
To prevent

1562
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:26,239
I'm going

1563
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:28,543
These are the kinds of

1564
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:30,079
Or shows

1565
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:32,383
Tragedies the Abominations that are occurring

1566
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:38,015
We talked about the younger queso while back it wasn't about a child being forced to take hormone replacement

1567
01:08:38,783 --> 01:08:41,343
There's a situation where the child disagreed on the bus pass

1568
01:08:41,599 --> 01:08:42,111
Steak and turn blue

1569
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:43,647
Transition with the father

1570
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:46,207
Going to take a more gradual watchful waiting approach

1571
01:08:46,463 --> 01:08:47,743
Anna mother wanting to engage

1572
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:48,767
Social affirmation

1573
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:55,423
I looked into the case and I don't really feel comfortable about how much of the conversation is wrapped up in a clearly ugly.

1574
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:59,519
Divorce between the two parent on I'm not getting gauge with this

1575
01:08:59,775 --> 01:09:00,799
The child as a proxy fight

1576
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:01,823
Between the two adults

1577
01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:07,199
It's important to notice that and recognize this case has nothing

1578
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:07,967
To do with 4C

1579
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:10,015
Sing a child to transition or take Peabody blockers

1580
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:12,063
Stairwell this is just

1581
01:09:12,575 --> 01:09:13,343
A prop again that

1582
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:14,623
Sneakers using another white

1583
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:15,391
A child

1584
01:09:15,647 --> 01:09:17,695
But he's using as lice look what they're doing

1585
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:19,743
It's it's almost as bad as

1586
01:09:19,999 --> 01:09:20,767
The blue-eyed

1587
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:22,815
White blond haired child

1588
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:23,583
Abducted at the

1589
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:27,935
Which totally totally happened

1590
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:28,959
This goes on

1591
01:09:29,215 --> 01:09:29,727
This is

1592
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:32,799
At what point are they good and

1593
01:09:33,055 --> 01:09:34,079
Decent and Christian

1594
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:36,639
Stand up

1595
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:40,735
Questions

1596
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:42,783
And I have a civil debate

1597
01:09:43,807 --> 01:09:44,831
And I'll be polite

1598
01:09:45,343 --> 01:09:45,855
But to say that

1599
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:47,903
This cannot go forward

1600
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:48,927
One more

1601
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:51,231
The conservative movement is broadly

1602
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:53,023
And you can't find

1603
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:53,791
A lot of

1604
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:55,071
Devout Christians

1605
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:56,095
Socialcam

1606
01:09:56,351 --> 01:09:58,399
Conservatives

1607
01:09:58,655 --> 01:09:59,679
Anything remotely like the Conte

1608
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:03,007
Within the leadership of the party

1609
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:04,799
Like this

1610
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:06,591
We're talking about sick

1611
01:10:07,103 --> 01:10:07,615
Stop

1612
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:09,663
And I'm not going to be respectful

1613
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:11,199
Of what they're up to I'm not going to

1614
01:10:11,967 --> 01:10:13,503
Both are anti-god anti-spam

1615
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:14,527
Anti-human

1616
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:15,295
Anti

1617
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:16,319
Conservative agenda

1618
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:18,111
We have to say no not just to

1619
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:19,903
Trans kids and girls

1620
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:21,951
And I just noted the

1621
01:10:22,207 --> 01:10:23,743
Forcibly transitioning children

1622
01:10:24,255 --> 01:10:25,023
We have to say no.

1623
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:25,791
Transitioning

1624
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:26,559
.

1625
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:27,327
SA node

1626
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:28,351
Trans.

1627
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:29,887
You cannot transition

1628
01:10:31,423 --> 01:10:31,935
Addition to other

1629
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:32,959
Genders

1630
01:10:33,215 --> 01:10:34,495
How to say no to homosexuality

1631
01:10:35,007 --> 01:10:36,287
We have to say no to lesbian

1632
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:38,591
Do the whole thing

1633
01:10:38,847 --> 01:10:39,871
What they're pushing

1634
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:42,431
Is something that is the antithesis

1635
01:10:42,943 --> 01:10:45,759
Obey traditional Christian moral world

1636
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:47,039
Okay

1637
01:10:47,295 --> 01:10:48,831
So now we have spiraled

1638
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:49,599
Listen to

1639
01:10:49,855 --> 01:10:51,903
Say no 200

1640
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:55,231
People at 8

1641
01:10:55,743 --> 01:10:59,839
Yep

1642
01:11:00,351 --> 01:11:00,863
Yeah

1643
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:01,887
God God

1644
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:03,679
Pretty far down this road here

1645
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:06,495
Yeah yeah yeah right

1646
01:11:06,751 --> 01:11:07,519
Old

1647
01:11:07,775 --> 01:11:09,823
Non-straight whites

1648
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:14,943
Should be eradicated is not a good starting point for

1649
01:11:15,455 --> 01:11:15,967
Consensus

1650
01:11:16,223 --> 01:11:16,735
I would say

1651
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:20,063
I feel I feel like holding these sorts

1652
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:26,463
What positions are going to make people not like you would say maybe they would make everybody not like you and it backs

1653
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:27,231
Would need to have

1654
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:33,375
History books specifically written about assholes like you to get people away from

1655
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:36,959
So the issue is that the family right the family is WhatsApp

1656
01:11:37,215 --> 01:11:37,983
Important end

1657
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:39,007
No

1658
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:41,055
Next Friday

1659
01:11:41,311 --> 01:11:43,615
Tried to be tolerant tell me about it

1660
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:45,407
Tell me about it

1661
01:11:45,919 --> 01:11:47,455
There is no meet me in the middle

1662
01:11:47,711 --> 01:11:51,039
Between families with biological men and women

1663
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:53,599
And men and women getting married and having kids

1664
01:11:53,855 --> 01:11:55,135
And whatever the hell

1665
01:11:56,927 --> 01:11:57,439
Going to put up

1666
01:11:58,719 --> 01:11:59,231
Call Ray

1667
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:00,767
Some of this

1668
01:12:01,023 --> 01:12:02,815
They were willing to say maybe

1669
01:12:03,327 --> 01:12:07,423
Okay people want to get married that doesn't have anything to do with me

1670
01:12:08,959 --> 01:12:10,751
Fast forward 15 years and the governor

1671
01:12:11,007 --> 01:12:14,591
Telling people will transition your children and cut their penises off

1672
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:17,919
And put them on hormone replacement therapy and not tell their parents

1673
01:12:18,687 --> 01:12:20,991
And you have to be okay with that you go to jail

1674
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:23,807
Well you're pushing the limits

1675
01:12:24,063 --> 01:12:24,575
I'll people

1676
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:26,623
People have

1677
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:28,159
Darryl Lenox and Derby

1678
01:12:29,695 --> 01:12:30,975
And the person who's going to stand up

1679
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:33,279
Say that when they run for office that person

1680
01:12:33,535 --> 01:12:35,583
It's going to be a very popular

1681
01:12:35,839 --> 01:12:36,351
Politician

1682
01:12:36,863 --> 01:12:40,191
I love the idea that you brought up

1683
01:12:40,447 --> 01:12:41,471
Episode 2 is that like

1684
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:43,263
Did the rewriting of

1685
01:12:43,519 --> 01:12:46,079
The Christian position on gay marriage

1686
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:48,639
Yeah

1687
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:50,431
We're giving it our best

1688
01:12:50,687 --> 01:12:51,199
Go

1689
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:54,015
We've done that mean if you think about

1690
01:12:54,271 --> 01:12:57,087
Christians and gay people up until this

1691
01:12:57,343 --> 01:13:02,463
Very moment you will notice that there has been nothing but tolerance

1692
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:08,863
We've killed them and hunted them Thursday the legal Tuesday

1693
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:09,887
Opposition

1694
01:13:10,143 --> 01:13:14,751
There was massive opposition to not

1695
01:13:15,007 --> 01:13:18,079
Being allowed to fire someone because they were gay

1696
01:13:18,335 --> 01:13:24,479
Not even gay marriage just not being able to how and out destroy their lives

1697
01:13:24,735 --> 01:13:29,087
Just for being gay and that's being re-written as Christians being tolerant

1698
01:13:29,343 --> 01:13:31,391
Ranger only push people so far

1699
01:13:31,647 --> 01:13:32,927
Kind of amazing how

1700
01:13:33,183 --> 01:13:35,231
Quickly conservatives forget things

1701
01:13:35,487 --> 01:13:37,791
It's almost as though it's a

1702
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:39,327
Expedia almost like

1703
01:13:39,839 --> 01:13:43,167
Just a matter of convenience and whatever will make the argument

1704
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:47,007
Yeah you know and then we talked about this

1705
01:13:47,263 --> 01:13:50,847
Is before I hate it when people are like I'm going to challenge you to a charity box

1706
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:51,871
Match that stupid

1707
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:53,407
What I am going to do

1708
01:13:53,663 --> 01:13:55,711
Is I'm going to challenge Nick Fuentes

1709
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:57,247
Into a charity

1710
01:13:57,503 --> 01:13:59,551
I'm going to pee directly into his eyes

1711
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:02,623
Spot all right never wins

1712
01:14:02,879 --> 01:14:06,719
To donate $10,000

1713
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:09,023
Glasses

1714
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:10,047
I do have glasses

1715
01:14:10,303 --> 01:14:16,447
And also I will be the only person peeing into his eyes and that's the whole game you better watch out

1716
01:14:16,959 --> 01:14:20,799
He is from the Chicagoland area

1717
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:24,895
He'll accept my challenge to let me pee directly into his eyes

1718
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:28,223
For awhile I drink a lot of coffee and I would

1719
01:14:28,479 --> 01:14:34,623
Mai-tais true enough for a 24 hours fan if I were you I would be more worried about him

1720
01:14:35,647 --> 01:14:39,999
Corner of new and telling you opinion

1721
01:14:40,255 --> 01:14:41,023
Physically I don't think you'll be

1722
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:42,559
He's the type

1723
01:14:42,815 --> 01:14:44,351
So this goes off

1724
01:14:46,143 --> 01:14:47,167
Really what it comes down to it

1725
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:49,471
The horn

1726
01:14:49,727 --> 01:14:50,239
And the Pitchfork

1727
01:14:50,495 --> 01:14:51,263
It's not easy

1728
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:54,079
The rainbow flag

1729
01:14:54,335 --> 01:14:56,127
Do people that just love each other

1730
01:14:56,383 --> 01:14:56,895
It's not easy

1731
01:14:57,919 --> 01:15:03,551
That's why conservatives now tolerate and support homosexuality transgenderism

1732
01:15:04,063 --> 01:15:06,879
And a number of other social ills because they say

1733
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:15,839
They say if it doesn't hurt somebody else if I'm not force before taking it

1734
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:19,935
What if you stand against

1735
01:15:22,495 --> 01:15:23,007
The time

1736
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:25,311
How funny is that

1737
01:15:25,567 --> 01:15:26,079
How

1738
01:15:26,335 --> 01:15:27,359
Funny is that

1739
01:15:28,383 --> 01:15:29,407
The entire

1740
01:15:29,663 --> 01:15:31,199
Message of your religion

1741
01:15:31,711 --> 01:15:32,991
Is so

1742
01:15:33,247 --> 01:15:34,527
Difficult to follow

1743
01:15:35,551 --> 01:15:36,575
Because you have

1744
01:15:37,087 --> 01:15:38,623
Basic human empathy

1745
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:42,975
Has nothing to do with your religion he's putting those two together

1746
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:44,511
He said that your religion

1747
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:46,303
Demands you overcome

1748
01:15:46,815 --> 01:15:51,935
Caring about other people in order to eradicate their style of existence

1749
01:15:54,751 --> 01:15:58,335
Stop using version of Christianity is Todd

1750
01:15:58,591 --> 01:16:01,151
It's hard to overcome

1751
01:16:01,407 --> 01:16:02,943
What we would have to assume

1752
01:16:03,455 --> 01:16:04,479
God gave you

1753
01:16:04,991 --> 01:16:09,343
Which is an instinctual need to care for other human beings around you

1754
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:14,463
Demands you override that

1755
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:19,071
It's a f****** test kill as many people who disagree with you is boss

1756
01:16:20,607 --> 01:16:21,119
Great

1757
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:23,167
It's not a race is also like

1758
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:24,191
To be clear

1759
01:16:24,447 --> 01:16:25,983
Good God this isn't just

1760
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:27,263
Just Nick being mad

1761
01:16:27,519 --> 01:16:28,287
About

1762
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:30,335
Lgbtq plus issues

1763
01:16:31,103 --> 01:16:32,383
This is this goes far beyond

1764
01:16:36,735 --> 01:16:37,247
The time

1765
01:16:37,503 --> 01:16:38,783
It doesn't just end it

1766
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:42,623
Transgender bathrooms or girls locker rooms

1767
01:16:44,927 --> 01:16:46,975
But not just friends

1768
01:16:49,535 --> 01:16:50,559
But you know what else

1769
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:53,887
Promiscuity abortion feminism

1770
01:16:54,143 --> 01:16:59,263
It all has to go because if you take our world you through to its logical conclusion

1771
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:08,735
Transition transition

1772
01:17:10,527 --> 01:17:15,391
And the differences are real and significant and they matter and if the differences matter than they have

1773
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:17,695
Differently

1774
01:17:17,951 --> 01:17:21,791
Open Society I told women are are bored with

1775
01:17:22,047 --> 01:17:23,583
Reproductive apparatus

1776
01:17:24,095 --> 01:17:24,607
Insofar as

1777
01:17:26,655 --> 01:17:27,423
Human population

1778
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:28,703
They have to be making

1779
01:17:28,959 --> 01:17:29,471
The babies

1780
01:17:30,751 --> 01:17:31,263
The babies

1781
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:32,543
They have

1782
01:17:32,799 --> 01:17:35,871
A certain disposition arrays that they've got a raise them too and that's a

1783
01:17:36,127 --> 01:17:36,895
Full-time job

1784
01:17:37,151 --> 01:17:38,687
What they're doing is marginalizing

1785
01:17:38,943 --> 01:17:39,455
Normal

1786
01:17:41,503 --> 01:17:42,783
They're marginalizing anybody

1787
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:44,063
That is not

1788
01:17:45,343 --> 01:17:45,855
I mean

1789
01:17:46,111 --> 01:17:49,695
This is beyond just being outrageously bigoted

1790
01:17:49,951 --> 01:17:51,231
Towards all sorts of

1791
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:54,047
Battles are just dumb

1792
01:17:54,815 --> 01:17:55,839
It's really dumb

1793
01:17:57,631 --> 01:17:58,399
I would

1794
01:17:58,911 --> 01:18:03,263
A follow-up question about this and I would say exactly on

1795
01:18:03,519 --> 01:18:06,335
What you can and can't change about how God Made You

1796
01:18:06,847 --> 01:18:08,383
You take medicine

1797
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:10,687
Can you dye your hair

1798
01:18:10,943 --> 01:18:11,967
Can you cut your hair

1799
01:18:13,759 --> 01:18:19,647
There are a number of things that seem to run afoul of his can you get any kind of like cosmetic surgery apparel

1800
01:18:19,903 --> 01:18:22,207
I can't get tattoos that's even in the

1801
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:23,999
So I would

1802
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:24,767
I would ask

1803
01:18:25,023 --> 01:18:25,791
About that

1804
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:26,815
About the idea of

1805
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:28,863
Changing how God Made You

1806
01:18:29,375 --> 01:18:31,935
If we could figure out exactly where the line on that is

1807
01:18:32,447 --> 01:18:34,239
Then I would ask what is prom

1808
01:18:34,495 --> 01:18:35,263
Acuity mean

1809
01:18:35,775 --> 01:18:37,055
How do you defined that

1810
01:18:37,311 --> 01:18:37,823
Exactly

1811
01:18:40,127 --> 01:18:40,639
That would you

1812
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:42,431
Do you want to make sex illegal

1813
01:18:44,223 --> 01:18:46,271
It's so it's so insane to me

1814
01:18:46,783 --> 01:18:48,063
How these dudes

1815
01:18:48,575 --> 01:18:51,647
These are dudes who are absolutely

1816
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:53,183
Screaming

1817
01:18:53,951 --> 01:18:58,047
Absolutely screaming about returning to these Christian values

1818
01:18:58,559 --> 01:19:00,351
That were their society

1819
01:19:00,607 --> 01:19:02,143
Ever to be implemented

1820
01:19:02,399 --> 01:19:03,423
They would be murder to me

1821
01:19:03,935 --> 01:19:05,215
A joke

1822
01:19:05,471 --> 01:19:06,495
The people make about the fact

1823
01:19:07,007 --> 01:19:07,519
Nick Fuentes

1824
01:19:07,775 --> 01:19:12,383
Is a white window

1825
01:19:12,639 --> 01:19:16,223
It's like no matter no matter it's it's one of those just

1826
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:17,247
F****** classic

1827
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:19,039
F*****-up brain stories

1828
01:19:19,295 --> 01:19:20,319
That have been written about

1829
01:19:20,575 --> 01:19:22,111
So much as that person who's like

1830
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:25,183
But my last name is fluent

1831
01:19:25,695 --> 01:19:27,487
But I want to be white

1832
01:19:27,743 --> 01:19:28,255
So bad

1833
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:30,303

You know what I'm saying

Classic f****** it's goddamn

1837
01:19:35,935 --> 01:19:36,447
Greek

1838
01:19:36,703 --> 01:19:39,519
Yeah cyclists is bothering me now

1839
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:42,847
You hear stuff like in that life

1840
01:19:43,103 --> 01:19:44,127
Best clip

1841
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:48,223
The implications of actual

1842
01:19:48,991 --> 01:19:49,759
He has none.

1843
01:19:50,271 --> 01:19:51,039
The positions that

1844
01:19:51,295 --> 01:19:52,063
He seems to be espousing

1845
01:19:52,319 --> 01:19:55,135
Looking for Lincoln Hub dumb they would be in their application in the real world

1846
01:19:56,415 --> 01:19:58,463
Ideas are not really

1847
01:19:58,719 --> 01:19:59,743
Something you should take Serious

1848
01:19:59,999 --> 01:20:01,279
Promiscuity

1849
01:20:01,535 --> 01:20:07,679
Should be outlawed and unacceptable and simple normal people like the 50% of marriages that

1850
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:14,080
End in divorce simple normal good condition can I ask also

1851
01:20:14,848 --> 01:20:17,664
I love to that he comes out of the

1852
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:23,040
Sort of conservative Wing that generally isn't favored a smaller government

1853
01:20:24,064 --> 01:20:26,368
Anti promiscuity laws

1854
01:20:26,624 --> 01:20:28,160
Soldiers on the streets

1855
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:33,024
Children you would outfit by giving them tickets

1856
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:34,560
It's them taking them to an Armory

1857
01:20:35,072 --> 01:20:38,144
I'm saying is like I think a lot of these

1858
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:40,192
Beat the ideas themselves are stupid

1859
01:20:40,448 --> 01:20:41,728
But they're really dumb and they're not

1860
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:43,008
Coming you should take Siri

1861
01:20:43,776 --> 01:20:45,824
But he still someone that you

1862
01:20:46,336 --> 01:20:46,848
Should be taken

1863
01:20:47,104 --> 01:20:47,616
Seriously

1864
01:20:47,872 --> 01:20:48,896
Outside of

1865
01:20:49,152 --> 01:20:50,432
Whether or not his ideas make

1866
01:20:50,688 --> 01:20:52,992
Make sense

1867
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:54,016
Thank you

1868
01:20:54,272 --> 01:20:56,064
No he's really nightmare

1869
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:57,600
Even

1870
01:20:57,856 --> 01:20:58,624
Really shocked

1871
01:20:58,880 --> 01:20:59,904
The

1872
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:01,184
Amount of

1873
01:21:02,208 --> 01:21:03,744
Escalation and elevation

1874
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:04,768
He's been able to

1875
01:21:05,024 --> 01:21:05,536
2

1876
01:21:05,792 --> 01:21:08,608
Engage a short. Of time

1877
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:09,632
He's

1878
01:21:09,888 --> 01:21:11,424
He's somebody who I

1879
01:21:11,936 --> 01:21:12,960
When you first showed up

1880
01:21:13,216 --> 01:21:14,496
On Infowars

1881
01:21:14,752 --> 01:21:16,288
I was like

1882
01:21:16,544 --> 01:21:18,848
YouTube dick hole is it

1883
01:21:19,104 --> 01:21:22,176
Alex is giving him a little bit of a platform

1884
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:24,224
The

1885
01:21:24,736 --> 01:21:25,248
Is the PAC Center

1886
01:21:25,504 --> 01:21:27,296
Lana is not something that people should

1887
01:21:27,808 --> 01:21:28,320
Should ignore

1888
01:21:28,832 --> 01:21:30,624
Yeah and Alex

1889
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:32,160
8 getting involved

1890
01:21:32,416 --> 01:21:33,696
To the level that he is

1891
01:21:35,232 --> 01:21:36,000
Is playing with fire

1892
01:21:38,304 --> 01:21:40,096
I know that you know Alex thinks

1893
01:21:40,352 --> 01:21:41,120
He does have some

1894
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:41,888
From skeleton term

1895
01:21:42,656 --> 01:21:43,680
Co-optional

1896
01:21:43,936 --> 01:21:45,216
Recognizing

1897
01:21:45,472 --> 01:21:47,008
Ways to make things work

1898
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:48,288
Best for him

1899
01:21:48,544 --> 01:21:49,312
But

1900
01:21:50,848 --> 01:21:52,896
I don't I don't I don't know if he's met anyone like me

1901
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:53,664
Nick before

1902
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:55,200
Well I mean not not

1903
01:21:55,712 --> 01:21:57,504
You know there's a part of me that says

1904
01:21:58,272 --> 01:22:01,088
This isn't exactly that he even brings up

1905
01:22:01,344 --> 01:22:02,368
You know like

1906
01:22:02,624 --> 01:22:05,696
This there is an audience for this and they're always has been

1907
01:22:05,952 --> 01:22:08,256
Steven was a presidential candidates

1908
01:22:08,512 --> 01:22:09,536
Allowed

1909
01:22:09,792 --> 01:22:15,936
And he was straight up white nationalist and let's kill gay people all the time you know you know

1910
01:22:16,192 --> 01:22:20,288
Nation space that exists now is so different every time you can

1911
01:22:21,312 --> 01:22:23,104
Buchanan wasn't old

1912
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:27,456
But by the time that you would never

1913
01:22:27,712 --> 01:22:33,856
Quote unquote cool youngboy

1914
01:22:34,112 --> 01:22:34,880
Niketalk

1915
01:22:35,392 --> 01:22:37,440
I've been in the 50s

1916
01:22:37,696 --> 01:22:39,232
It was so cool to hang out with ex

1917
01:22:39,744 --> 01:22:45,120
Penny was a mean

1918
01:22:46,912 --> 01:22:48,448
Subway

1919
01:22:48,704 --> 01:22:50,240
It's around 2 talking

1920
01:22:50,496 --> 01:22:51,264
About how

1921
01:22:52,288 --> 01:22:52,800
Quick transition

1922
01:22:53,056 --> 01:22:53,568
Is Justin Poss

1923
01:22:58,688 --> 01:23:02,784
Not even trans-exclusionary

1924
01:23:03,808 --> 01:23:08,160
Just a big old fobe

1925
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:09,184
So

1926
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:09,952
Full of hate

1927
01:23:11,488 --> 01:23:13,024
This this clip is where I really think

1928
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:14,048
Turn

1929
01:23:16,608 --> 01:23:17,632
I can't believe he's actually even

1930
01:23:17,888 --> 01:23:18,400
Just saying this

1931
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:19,680
I do not think

1932
01:23:20,704 --> 01:23:21,216
Gender

1933
01:23:21,472 --> 01:23:22,496
And transsexual

1934
01:23:23,008 --> 01:23:23,520
Should be normalized

1935
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:25,568
I think it's morally wrong

1936
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:27,104
I think it's Morley Bank

1937
01:23:28,896 --> 01:23:30,176
Transition from one gender

1938
01:23:30,432 --> 01:23:31,712
You can't do that

1939
01:23:31,968 --> 01:23:34,272
Yes you can

1940
01:23:35,808 --> 01:23:36,576
And there's no cross

1941
01:23:36,832 --> 01:23:38,368
Passing over you can put on a winner

1942
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:40,672
You can put on lipstick you can put on a dress

1943
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:42,208
It doesn't make you a woman

1944
01:23:42,976 --> 01:23:46,304
What does not happen in our society we shouldn't have it on television

1945
01:23:46,816 --> 01:23:48,608
We shouldn't have an elected office

1946
01:23:49,632 --> 01:23:51,168
And we should be passing laws

1947
01:23:52,704 --> 01:23:54,496
And the same goes for homosexuality

1948
01:23:54,752 --> 01:23:56,032
And the same goes for abortion

1949
01:23:56,288 --> 01:23:57,568
These things are wrong

1950
01:23:57,824 --> 01:24:01,408
And we shouldn't have them in our society they shouldn't be glorified

1951
01:24:02,432 --> 01:24:05,504
We should not get too comfortable at them they should not be normalized

1952
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:08,064
In fact they should be marginal

1953
01:24:08,832 --> 01:24:10,624
And people should see them as what they are

1954
01:24:11,136 --> 01:24:11,904
Gravely

1955
01:24:13,184 --> 01:24:14,976
And disordered and misguided

1956
01:24:15,232 --> 01:24:15,744
Damn

1957
01:24:16,256 --> 01:24:18,304
I mean like bigotry is awful

1958
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:19,072
And it's really too

1959
01:24:20,864 --> 01:24:25,216
Support and calling for legislation that would outlaw

1960
01:24:25,472 --> 01:24:26,496
Trans existence

1961
01:24:27,008 --> 01:24:28,544
Outlaw being gay

1962
01:24:29,056 --> 01:24:30,848
Outlaw abortion

1963
01:24:31,104 --> 01:24:31,872
Pretty

1964
01:24:32,128 --> 01:24:34,432
Pretty serious I've got some brand new idea

1965
01:24:35,456 --> 01:24:38,016
Brand new ideas 2021

1966
01:24:38,272 --> 01:24:41,088
Hot off the presses never before

1967
01:24:41,344 --> 01:24:42,880
Try ideas

1968
01:24:43,392 --> 01:24:45,696
Like legislating against the exist

1969
01:24:45,952 --> 01:24:48,512
Sense of human being

1970
01:24:48,768 --> 01:24:54,656
And when they did do that which I'm not saying they did it went great see the reason that people don't want to

1971
01:24:54,912 --> 01:24:56,192
Engage with people like naked

1972
01:24:56,448 --> 01:24:57,984
Because they're afraid of this this kind of

1973
01:24:58,240 --> 01:25:00,800
Brand new Visionary pink

1974
01:25:01,568 --> 01:25:02,848
Visionary

1975
01:25:03,104 --> 01:25:06,176
Really cutting-edge lotta f****** genius

1976
01:25:06,432 --> 01:25:12,320
Here's what I think we should do

1977
01:25:12,832 --> 01:25:14,112
Very clearly

1978
01:25:15,648 --> 01:25:17,184
Racist homophobe

1979
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:18,464
Transphobe

1980
01:25:19,744 --> 01:25:20,256
Bark

1981
01:25:20,512 --> 01:25:25,376
It's almost like he cares more about the bigotry than he does whatever the bigotry is about you just love

1982
01:25:26,656 --> 01:25:28,448
He probably feels really good so happy

1983
01:25:28,704 --> 01:25:29,728
Get the ball out of attention

1984
01:25:29,984 --> 01:25:30,496
I get some angry

1985
01:25:30,752 --> 01:25:35,104
So I bet you have that merging of all of these disparate bigotry

1986
01:25:36,384 --> 01:25:39,200
I desire to advocate for in work

1987
01:25:39,456 --> 01:25:39,968
Towards

1988
01:25:40,224 --> 01:25:42,016
A governmental system

1989
01:25:42,272 --> 01:25:44,320
That is Buick rattikin nature

1990
01:25:44,576 --> 01:25:45,088
And

1991
01:25:45,344 --> 01:25:47,648
Operates in such a way that would

1992
01:25:48,672 --> 01:25:49,952
Public laws

1993
01:25:50,208 --> 01:25:50,720
Against

1994
01:25:51,232 --> 01:25:51,744
Being gay

1995
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:52,768
Public laws against

1996
01:25:53,024 --> 01:25:53,536
Strands

1997
01:25:53,792 --> 01:25:54,560
Existence

1998
01:25:54,816 --> 01:25:55,584
Public laws against

1999
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:56,352
Feminism

2000
01:25:57,888 --> 01:25:59,936
That's a terrifying Prospect

2001
01:26:00,192 --> 01:26:00,704
Of what

2002
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:01,728
He is

2003
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:03,008
Explicitly

2004
01:26:03,264 --> 01:26:03,776
Calling for you

2005
01:26:04,032 --> 01:26:04,544
Yes

2006
01:26:05,312 --> 01:26:07,616
One last clip here from this

2007
01:26:07,872 --> 01:26:10,432
Report a little bit of a breakdown

2008
01:26:11,456 --> 01:26:15,808
The foundation of the civilization is the family

2009
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:20,416
Where do children come from they don't come from factories

2010
01:26:20,672 --> 01:26:25,280
They don't come from the government they don't come from corporations you don't come from farms

2011
01:26:25,792 --> 01:26:31,680
They come from the womb of women as they come from men and women

2012
01:26:31,936 --> 01:26:36,288
Listen lie within marriage he don't have any

2013
01:26:36,544 --> 01:26:40,640
That's the only way to degrade the only way that you get baby

2014
01:26:41,152 --> 01:26:41,664
The only way that

2015
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:43,712
You perpetuate a society

2016
01:26:44,224 --> 01:26:49,088
Is by men and women getting married and having children

2017
01:26:49,344 --> 01:26:55,488
Society that is society that is how Society propagates itself

2018
01:26:55,744 --> 01:26:57,280
That's how it perpetuates itself

2019
01:26:59,584 --> 01:27:01,632
Elemental foundation of the sea

2020
01:27:01,888 --> 01:27:02,400
Society

2021
01:27:02,656 --> 01:27:03,168
And in order

2022
01:27:03,424 --> 01:27:04,192
For that process

2023
01:27:04,448 --> 01:27:04,960
What happened

2024
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:07,776
He created and for them to be raised

2025
01:27:08,288 --> 01:27:09,056
And inculcated

2026
01:27:09,312 --> 01:27:10,080
With the culture

2027
01:27:10,848 --> 01:27:13,664
And to learn what they need to know for the transmission of knowledge

2028
01:27:14,432 --> 01:27:15,712
You need to have

2029
01:27:15,968 --> 01:27:16,736
Marriages

2030
01:27:16,992 --> 01:27:18,272
You need to have men

2031
01:27:18,528 --> 01:27:19,296
And you need to have

2032
01:27:20,576 --> 01:27:21,344
And by marriage

2033
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:22,368
Do not misunderstand

2034
01:27:22,624 --> 01:27:23,648
First and what I mean you

2035
01:27:25,952 --> 01:27:26,464
The Union

2036
01:27:27,488 --> 01:27:29,024
Between one man and one woman

2037
01:27:31,584 --> 01:27:32,608
That's the only way that you get

2038
01:27:34,912 --> 01:27:35,424
Everything

2039
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:36,192
That is supposed

2040
01:27:36,448 --> 01:27:37,728
Anything that tries to

2041
01:27:37,984 --> 01:27:38,752
To confound that or

2042
01:27:39,008 --> 01:27:40,032
Refuse that are office

2043
01:27:40,288 --> 01:27:40,800
Escape.

2044
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:42,592
Pure Evil

2045
01:27:42,848 --> 01:27:43,360
And that is

2046
01:27:43,616 --> 01:27:44,640
The enemy of society

2047
01:27:45,408 --> 01:27:45,920
I mean

2048
01:27:46,432 --> 01:27:47,200
I just don't even

2049
01:27:47,968 --> 01:27:50,016
I mean this guy this guy needs to be stopped

2050
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:04,864
How do we stop this guy conversation

2051
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:09,216
Let's have a dialogue of times and stories like

2052
01:28:09,472 --> 01:28:12,544
Fictitious that you'll see something like this once it's too late

2053
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:17,920
Exactly exactly is already risen to power or something

2054
01:28:18,944 --> 01:28:24,064
Video is played in Times Square in the horror movie he thinks he's living it

2055
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:25,344
Clear Lake

2056
01:28:25,856 --> 01:28:27,136
Cute saying need to stop

2057
01:28:27,392 --> 01:28:30,720
It's not a matter of hurting him or

2058
01:28:31,232 --> 01:28:33,792
Anything like that it's a matter of

2059
01:28:34,304 --> 01:28:36,096
Dealing with what he's doing it in a

2060
01:28:36,352 --> 01:28:38,144
In a in a way that is response

2061
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:41,984
Recognized

2062
01:28:42,496 --> 01:28:45,056
Hit you very justifiably should have

2063
01:28:45,568 --> 01:28:47,616
The other response which is like

2064
01:28:47,872 --> 01:28:51,456
He wants you to be angry don't be that Angry Dragon recognize

2065
01:28:51,712 --> 01:28:54,528
How stupid a lot of these ideas are there's an empath

2066
01:28:54,784 --> 01:28:55,808
Hey. And

2067
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:57,344
I honestly think that there's a

2068
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:59,392
The huge resentment that he feels that most

2069
01:28:59,648 --> 01:29:01,184
People don't actually agree with

2070
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,560
Except that gay people exist

2071
01:29:06,816 --> 01:29:08,096
Most people

2072
01:29:08,608 --> 01:29:09,120
Aren't

2073
01:29:09,632 --> 01:29:13,472
Most people have the basic human empathy that his religion demands they ignore

2074
01:29:13,984 --> 01:29:15,776
Or his version of his religion

2075
01:29:16,032 --> 01:29:17,824
Make sure people don't

2076
01:29:18,848 --> 01:29:21,152
I think you're Christianity like

2077
01:29:21,664 --> 01:29:25,248
Google Alerts

2078
01:29:25,504 --> 01:29:26,528
Very clearly

2079
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:28,576
Christianity is not a Blog

2080
01:29:29,344 --> 01:29:29,856
Religion

2081
01:29:30,112 --> 01:29:31,648
Not a monolithic

2082
01:29:31,904 --> 01:29:34,720
10 million types of Christianity

2083
01:29:35,488 --> 01:29:36,000
So

2084
01:29:38,048 --> 01:29:38,816
I was surprised

2085
01:29:39,072 --> 01:29:40,864
Honestly cuz I don't Nick

2086
01:29:41,888 --> 01:29:43,680
You know

2087
01:29:44,192 --> 01:29:46,752
I know that I know what he believes and I think it's a little it's got

2088
01:29:47,264 --> 01:29:47,776
Probably

2089
01:29:48,032 --> 01:29:52,640
Maybe even a little bit more over it seems some ways from the last time I checked in on its content

2090
01:29:52,896 --> 01:29:56,480
And it was it was bizarre to just click on

2091
01:29:56,736 --> 01:29:58,528
Banned. Video there's a section

2092
01:29:59,040 --> 01:29:59,552
Tortilla man

2093
01:29:59,808 --> 01:30:03,648
These videos are pretty easily accessible and whether Alex wants to

2094
01:30:03,904 --> 01:30:05,440
Take ownership of this or not

2095
01:30:05,696 --> 01:30:09,024
He owns that website he's promoting this he's platforming this

2096
01:30:09,536 --> 01:30:12,096
He's tacitly accepting us and he's profiting off

2097
01:30:12,864 --> 01:30:13,632
You know

2098
01:30:13,888 --> 01:30:15,680
There is no other way around

2099
01:30:16,704 --> 01:30:20,800
And it's like

2100
01:30:21,056 --> 01:30:22,336
Is there tags or it's like

2101
01:30:22,592 --> 01:30:23,104
If somebody search

2102
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:27,968
Looking for white nationalists this will show up here saying just awesome that out there it's going to be at the Google search results

2103
01:30:28,224 --> 01:30:33,600
I think that Alex is aware that the video doesn't show up in Google search

2104
01:30:33,856 --> 01:30:34,880
Might have been d-list

2105
01:30:35,392 --> 01:30:36,416
That's fair

2106
01:30:37,696 --> 01:30:41,024
Like I guess like I guess this works for Alex as long as Nick doesn't

2107
01:30:41,536 --> 01:30:45,632
Put out any videos that completely undercut the basis of Alex's entire can

2108
01:30:45,888 --> 01:30:47,168
Conspiratorial worldview

2109
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:48,192
Uh-oh

2110
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:49,984
The try guys wanted

2111
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:51,776
Destroy America from within

2112
01:30:52,288 --> 01:30:53,824
I texted this to a good friend of mine

2113
01:30:54,336 --> 01:30:55,104
I said these Boomers

2114
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:55,872
They're talking about

2115
01:30:56,640 --> 01:30:57,152
Try to watch a

2116
01:30:57,408 --> 01:30:58,944
To destroy America from within

2117
01:31:00,992 --> 01:31:02,016
Good friend of mine

2118
01:31:02,528 --> 01:31:03,040
What is funny

2119
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:06,368
I would give anything for the chai,

2120
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:07,648
Destroy America

2121
01:31:10,976 --> 01:31:12,512
True

2122
01:31:13,024 --> 01:31:13,536
What

2123
01:31:14,048 --> 01:31:14,560
A hole

2124
01:31:14,816 --> 01:31:15,584
Hilarious

2125
01:31:16,352 --> 01:31:16,864
Just

2126
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:19,168
So funny good luck with this guy Alex

2127
01:31:19,424 --> 01:31:20,192
Wow

2128
01:31:20,448 --> 01:31:24,544
So I texted my friend about the guy whose website you're watching the song

2129
01:31:27,616 --> 01:31:30,944
Dumb moron who thinks that pichai comes there a problem

2130
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:33,504
This a****** I texted

2131
01:31:34,016 --> 01:31:35,296
The person who is

2132
01:31:35,552 --> 01:31:39,904
Hosting this content that you are watching this video on

2133
01:31:40,416 --> 01:31:42,208
I texted Mike funniest friends

2134
01:31:42,464 --> 01:31:48,608
About the jumpship the person who is hosting the got that you are watching we all left about how

2135
01:31:48,864 --> 01:31:54,752
He believes that on the side of the bad guys are naked.

2136
01:31:56,032 --> 01:31:59,104
Oh okay well maybe Alex doesn't know about this

2137
01:32:00,896 --> 01:32:02,176
I don't know I don't know what the deal is

2138
01:32:02,432 --> 01:32:03,200
This is this is

2139
01:32:03,968 --> 01:32:05,760
Pathetic and not good

2140
01:32:10,368 --> 01:32:11,648
We might be experiencing cancel culture

2141
01:32:15,744 --> 01:32:20,608
I am. Video from this van. Video you know who's going to come out ahead

2142
01:32:21,376 --> 01:32:21,888
Nick

2143
01:32:22,656 --> 01:32:23,680
Anyway

2144
01:32:23,936 --> 01:32:26,752
I wanted to take a little bit of a break from

2145
01:32:27,008 --> 01:32:29,824
Text for a day if so

2146
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:36,224
I knew that the Nick had this Channel and I wanted to give it a little bit of time for some content to accumulate

2147
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:38,528
For we took a look at it and this

2148
01:32:38,784 --> 01:32:41,856
Is a cross-section it's one of the stuff that it's there it's

2149
01:32:42,368 --> 01:32:43,136
Extremely

2150
01:32:43,648 --> 01:32:44,160
Bucked up

2151
01:32:44,416 --> 01:32:45,184
It is over

2152
01:32:45,696 --> 01:32:46,720
It is

2153
01:32:46,976 --> 01:32:48,256
It is not making

2154
01:32:48,512 --> 01:32:50,048
Any bones about what his position

2155
01:32:50,304 --> 01:32:51,328
Cazares

2156
01:32:51,584 --> 01:32:53,376
Unbelievable unbelievable

2157
01:32:53,632 --> 01:32:55,680
You can have a video right now

2158
01:32:55,936 --> 01:32:58,240
Next to another video and then one video you say

2159
01:32:58,752 --> 01:33:00,544
Whenever they dehumanized

2160
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:01,312
People

2161
01:33:01,568 --> 01:33:04,384
They think we're less than human and that leads to White BB

2162
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:05,664
White people being killed

2163
01:33:06,176 --> 01:33:07,456
To the next video being like

2164
01:33:07,968 --> 01:33:09,248
Trans people aren't actually people

2165
01:33:10,016 --> 01:33:16,160
God demands that you get rid of them until log

2166
01:33:16,416 --> 01:33:16,928
They are less

2167
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:18,464
Then human

2168
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:26,400
Sorry I was terrified by this and I don't know I'll check back in on his thing event

2169
01:33:26,656 --> 01:33:28,192
Actually we'll see how

2170
01:33:28,448 --> 01:33:30,240
How this works out for these job down this

2171
01:33:30,752 --> 01:33:36,896
There was a two-hour debate about the Middle East and Barnes

2172
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:38,688
And

2173
01:33:38,944 --> 01:33:41,248
I tried to watch a bit of it and I was like

2174
01:33:41,504 --> 01:33:43,040
Ono Barnes

2175
01:33:43,808 --> 01:33:49,952
You don't know how good Nick is at the Barnes is a shity lawyer even in the face

2176
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:52,256
Face of a lawyer

2177
01:33:52,512 --> 01:33:53,280
Nick is

2178
01:33:53,792 --> 01:33:54,560
He's the debate cap

2179
01:33:54,816 --> 01:33:57,376
You don't need you don't want to

2180
01:33:57,632 --> 01:33:58,656
They don't mix up with him

2181
01:33:59,168 --> 01:33:59,936
Barnes

2182
01:34:00,448 --> 01:34:00,960
I don't give a s***

2183
01:34:01,472 --> 01:34:03,776
