00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:21,248
Air Jordan

2
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:27,648
I have great respect for its knowledge by now I'm sick of them posing as you're through the good guy

3
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:57,088
Collegeboard.com

4
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:07,840
Dick novelty beverages little bit about Alex Jones

5
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:10,144
Then what was your first

6
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,496
Social media page

7
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,104
Probably my face

8
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:25,760
I know that I was on Facebook

9
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:30,880
Had to be College email address on it

10
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:42,912
Villas Emerald was Upper Darby

11
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,776
I very strongly resisted getting on it

12
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:48,544
Because

13
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,848
It seems like a very much like a frat

14
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:51,616
Kind of thing

15
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:54,432
World

16
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:55,200
Connection

17
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:00,320
I had that vibe

18
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,880
Call him for my camp

19
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:04,416
I got some

20
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:05,440
I got like 8 Mile

21
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:06,720
Like this

22
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:07,744
People look dumb

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,512
Dumb dumb

24
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:13,376
Wonderwall

25
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:18,240
A really mean about your ass kind of course

26
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:19,520
I'm instalike

27
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:24,640
No no

28
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:26,176
I wonder who this guy is

29
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:28,992
I remember my brother being like you could check if he's on

30
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:35,648
See if you can find us an inference

31
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:42,048
Motivated me to join the Facebook was to find out like

32
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:47,424
Can I install this guy

33
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,448
Human races

34
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,216
Demise

35
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:54,080
Unfortunately that's what suckered me in to Facebook

36
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:57,152
Mike my personal use face

37
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:57,920
Personally

38
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:59,712
But

39
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:00,736
All that information

40
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:09,440
It's terrible

41
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,744
Bears on their butt out

42
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,048
Terrible

43
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:16,608
Any product

44
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:22,752
Alex Jones

45
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:26,592
Tell me about any number of those things

46
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,272
Don't Furley or the week

47
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,368
Did not know that

48
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:40,416
Alex named first

49
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:46,816
Debate coverage

50
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:47,584
Special

51
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,864
She named after a

52
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:52,448
Vaguely anti-Semitic

53
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:04,992
He has usura

54
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,040
Come on

55
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:10,880
Perfect timing

56
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:15,232
But you're trying to get

57
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:20,095
Because this is a 40-hour live

58
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:26,751
He's doing money Bombs all the time it's almost like the other one was a huge 40 hours

59
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:30,847
I don't know if he was going the entire time but it was at least

60
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:31,615
Tonight

61
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:36,223
Really long live spectacular

62
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,527
Two days straight

63
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:42,879
I've learned

64
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:44,415
My lesson with Alex Jones

65
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,695
Moneyball Marathon

66
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:47,743
That is like don't even bother with

67
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:50,815
The times that Alex is gone

68
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:51,583
He's going to be

69
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:52,863
You don't

70
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:58,239
It's going to be fun and games I'm just going to sit here and listen

71
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:01,311
In 240 hours of this dumb b******* and then

72
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,871
Hours and hours of Harrison Smith

73
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:06,175
Phoning it in at 2 in the morning

74
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:09,247
And I'm just playing half-hour commercials to fill time

75
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,527
It's not worth it it's

76
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,295
Stupid

77
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:13,855
The only value in it is Alex Jones getting drunk

78
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,159
Which he's on a tightly

79
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:19,999
The show

80
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:26,399
Whenever he's doing his normal show

81
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:28,447
So in the 40 hour marathon

82
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,471
He still only

83
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,007
To show for 3 hours

84
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:40,223
Gaston song

85
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,271
In the evening

86
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:43,807
In our block

87
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,087
To do an Ama

88
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:51,487
The drunk still show up for part of the debate coverage that Robert Barnes

89
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:53,535
Waterbar

90
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:59,935
Thank you God blackmail

91
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:04,543
This is not normal this is the way he's taken over this network

92
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:10,943
Please try to kill you

93
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,247
Edible version of Rodger Stone

94
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,295
Insinuated

95
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,063
Themselves

96
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:17,855
Has he had

97
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:18,623
Presumptive

98
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,671
Access to Trump

99
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:32,959
How desperate Alex's to Kalama to some powerful personality that wants

100
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:36,543
Take him over

101
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,591
HR department

102
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:42,431
I wanted to look into

103
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:44,735
Debate stuff but I didn't want to watch the whole thing

104
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,527
Because I know that

105
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:52,671
He's not going to be there for the entire time that they're doing the debate coverage suffice is just to listen to his show

106
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:55,231
Now we're going to be going over July 31st

107
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:58,047
2019 the day after the

108
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,327
First night of the debate

109
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:02,143
I don't really care about the second night of the debate

110
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:04,191
Interesting

111
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:06,239
281

112
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,263
I don't I don't

113
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,799
I'm not

114
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,847
I'm not over the moon with any of it

115
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:13,919
But the larger conversation of anybody whose

116
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:16,479
Maybe me or Alex Jones

117
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,527
Probably going to be surrounding the first night

118
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,063
Cuz you had

119
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:25,695
Bernie Warren Elizabeth Warren you had everybody

120
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:28,511
Is going to make things

121
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:30,047
What are you guys

122
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:38,239
This is that much on climate change

123
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,775
Technically

124
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:40,543
You're right

125
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:46,943
And everybody else

126
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,223
Right but

127
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:48,991
Forsake

128
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,015
Time

129
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,295
Micros

130
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:55,135
Let's play map change never be solved by mixing metaphors

131
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:57,183
But I don't really care about what Alex

132
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:59,487
To take on the second night

133
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,023
Particularly because

00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:04,351

135
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,399

00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:57,503
We're coming off

168
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:58,527
Debate

169
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,295
Night

170
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,319
Watch

171
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:03,391
Alex was there for the live coverage

172
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:05,183
He was only there for party

173
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,207
But the reason is

174
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,743
Because he thought it was

175
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,071
Heroes Reborn

176
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,423
Here today

177
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,983
On the

178
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:35,391
Bigger theory about this and that Alex realizes that

179
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:37,951
Conversation

180
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:38,719
In 4th

181
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,743
You can't really argue

182
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:46,143
Articulated argument for medicare-for-all like the

183
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,423
He's really good with these

184
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:52,287
Distractionary things like good with addressing the point of

185
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:55,871
Yes your taxes will go up but your premium and your copay okay

186
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,175
It's a net

187
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:01,247
446

188
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:04,831
Supposed to

189
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:11,231
Articulate

190
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:13,023
Boring

191
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,047
Because he doesn't

192
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,071
He's not good

193
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:17,119
He's not good

194
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,471
We're also the one

195
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:24,543
Who were yelling at Sanders about how it's going to rain

196
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,311
Texas

197
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:28,895
The Republic

198
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:29,663
Parties

199
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,711
So I can Avatar there forever

200
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:32,735
In the form of a

201
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:36,831
Play the CNN

202
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:39,903
Complicated position

203
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:48,607
Establishment

204
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:49,887
Just alright

205
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,959
Yeah it's not really good for him so

206
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:55,263
Part of the reason why he ended up just like Lee

207
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,567
His own show in a night before

208
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,175
I'm going home

209
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:07,551
Broadcast

210
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,743
It was nauseated watching it

211
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:23,423
20 minutes at a time because I just couldn't watch it

212
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:28,543
I felt my time would be better served by Ram

213
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:33,151
Fairlake what I watched all the 26

214
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:36,991
16 presidential debates on Infowars like I watched their coverage of a

215
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,783
I made a point of doing that

216
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,063
God knows what reason

217
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,647
In our lives

218
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:45,183
I thought it was all fun and games

219
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:46,719
But

220
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:53,119
Really cover what's happening

221
00:12:56,703 --> 00:13:01,311
Didn't have the material he wanted to work with

222
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,103
Barnes

223
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:06,687
OMG you got this enjoy I'm going home

224
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:07,967
But

225
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:08,991
He does have a conclusion

226
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,295
About

227
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:15,135
Despite not really paying attention to or watching

228
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,415
Any of this other than

229
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:18,719
Some select clips that people have given

230
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,511
He has a definitive

231
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,095
These candidates

232
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:27,935
There is no doubt that these individuals

233
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,495
Absolutely

234
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,103
And paint

235
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:38,175
Positions of power

236
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:41,247
Sabotaging bring

237
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,039
This nation down

238
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,063
That sounds right

239
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:52,767
Feel it

240
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,047
Burhan

241
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:59,423
I have to relive

242
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:01,471
I don't know

243
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:09,151
I've even have a tough time trying to unify all of those candidates

244
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:14,271
People are paid to bring down America

245
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:15,551
Such

246
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:19,391
Different philosophy

247
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:20,671
Backgrounds

248
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,975
Better represent

249
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,279
Backstage

250
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,303
I get them

251
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:30,655
There is a variety of

252
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,191
Ideology

253
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:39,871
Less interesting than the idle ideology is the practical way they

254
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:42,687
Talkin about

255
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:44,991
Warren

256
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,783
Detailed plans are

257
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:49,343
Twisting not just because they are very

258
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,367
Progressive

259
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:55,999
Forward Sanders

260
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:01,375
Willing to do what Santa's has always been willing to do for 40 years which

261
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:03,167
Might as well be f****** walk-up

262
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,191
Front of the White House

263
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:04,959
While he's

264
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:09,567
In protest himself

265
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:14,943
Buttigeig who is small-town mayor who's f****** up his own

266
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,271
You should be there

267
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,551
Actually no any

268
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:25,951
I think you confused he's very sad

269
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:29,279
Goes like

270
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:32,607
No you're not even a person of course you got the winner of the night

271
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:39,775
Which is Alex is Angola on

272
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:45,663
Marianne Williamson

273
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:47,967
The new Ager

274
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:04,351
Because she was the only one that was genuine

275
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,143
That's not what

276
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,703
She was genuinely wrong

277
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,543
She was genuinely

278
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,383
Thanks

279
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:22,527
Tumi

280
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:24,319
The headline Maryann William

281
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,343
In wonder

282
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,111
Debate which

283
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,135
Something that I read

284
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:29,439
Internet

285
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:32,255
Yeah is the reason that these debates are pointless

286
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:33,791
Ratings

287
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,327
Right

288
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:36,351
There's nothing

289
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,655
If if your headline

290
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,287
Zoomer dog

291
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:47,359
But there's something else going on here that's worth

292
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:52,223
There were a lot of pinion

293
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:56,831
The written about how Marianne Williamson won the first night of the second round

294
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,415
Clickbait headlines articles

295
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:02,463
Discuss how she

296
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,231
Tough question

297
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:05,535
Things surrounding reparations

298
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,559
In particular

299
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:08,351
Makes a lot of sense on a people

300
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:10,143
Enjoyed that everyone

301
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:10,911
Point that out

302
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,983
Also she use the term dark psycho

303
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:14,751
Kickforce

304
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:18,591
Which Google traffic

305
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,383
Fun

306
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:23,711
The Narrative its realism was the most

307
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,991
Google candidate name

308
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,015
After the debate

309
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:30,367
Support or a belief in these people that she won the debate

310
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,135
That's just

311
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:31,903
Proof

312
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:36,255
People thought that you was interesting and wanted to learn about this year dark psychic Force

313
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,047
What else is talking about

314
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,399
Sweetly unscientific internet polls

315
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:44,191
We're right-wing Dick's mounted

316
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:47,263
To drive people to vote for Marianne Williamson

317
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,543
To create the appearance

318
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,335
She's a far more popular candidate

319
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:52,639
With the hopes of Muddy in the water

320
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:55,711
The right

321
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:56,991
Candidate

322
00:17:57,247 --> 00:18:00,575
Create the air of legitimacy as a real Contender is in their best interest

323
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:03,391
Campaigns on 4chan

324
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,951
Followers to spam The Drudge

325
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:10,303
Marianne Williamson craziest person up there right now

326
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:11,839
She's an unhinged Luna

327
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:14,399
Would be perfect candidate to have no chance

328
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:18,495
People responded with anybody know of any other polls

329
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:19,775
Devote besides Drudge

330
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:21,567
Looney Anne Williamson needs RC

331
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:26,687
Support do what you're supposed it posted a list of other phone

332
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:28,735
Another user put it bluntly

333
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:32,063
Call you guys are rigging The Drudge poll and that's a good thing

334
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:37,951
From their right-wing sites used as well as other easily rigged

335
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:39,231
The Blazing Breitbart

336
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:41,023
To create their new talking points

337
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:44,095
That Marianne Williamson was the winner of the first night of debate

338
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:46,655
This is a very

339
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:48,191
Write a talking point with I hope so

340
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:51,007
Boosting a could easily defeat

341
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:54,847
Questioningly picked up that talk and it is disseminate

342
00:18:55,359 --> 00:19:00,223
Give literally zero standards for as long as it suits his interest

343
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:02,783
Because he is a butthole.

344
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:03,551
Propaganda

345
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,367
Well now

346
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:11,487
In 2015

347
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:12,767
F****** president

348
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:19,167
Because what else did people say whenever Trump was running in those first f****** debate I think that's the reason why I believe it

349
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:24,543
Vox Loretta pizza but like

350
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:26,847
Does makes

351
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:27,615
Good point

352
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:28,383
Which

353
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:29,663
She should have a column

354
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:36,063
Or maybe she could be a common to a talking head on her show that you know put her on put her on MSNBC

355
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:39,391
Maybe fits in well with her

356
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,671
Running for president

357
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:42,719
We have. We are we are

358
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:45,023
So far gone that this isn't it

359
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:47,071
But seriously how about we have

360
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:50,911
People who should be on reality TV shows instead of the

361
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,191
20 win the

362
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:56,287
That's a scary proposition

363
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:58,079
Of where we're at right now

364
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:04,479
Even though everything about her is terrible even though there are a lot of really messed up

365
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:10,623
Did for the past like that kind of narrative

366
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,207
Really bad

367
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:19,071
People like Alex

368
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:30,591
Is Beauty's bad

369
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:32,383
And from the right all the good stuff is

370
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,151
Is bad

371
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:35,199
And so that means

372
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:40,575
Bright Brigade

373
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:41,599
During the first

374
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:43,903
Masturbate the first round

375
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:48,255
Goldie's pools that don't have any kind of

376
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,023
Controls

377
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,559
Multiple voting

378
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,095
These are

379
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:56,959
They're very easily treatable right and when you have enough people centralized

380
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:58,495
That are willing to

381
00:20:59,007 --> 00:20:59,519
Keep voting

382
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:00,543
You're able to read

383
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,311
These things sofa

384
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:03,103
F****** easily and that's what they're doing

385
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:05,663
Animedia that is willing to take

386
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,455
Take those b*******

387
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:08,223
People in

388
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:09,503
Signal boost them

389
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:11,039
Sent that almost

390
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:13,599
Create the reality

391
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,367
Create

392
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:23,072
Do you think one of the reasons you know nothing else about Matt Drudge

393
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:25,632
The fact that you would run a pole like that

394
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:27,936
On his site that has

395
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:31,264
Huge credibility on the right-wing

396
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,824
Tells you everything you need to know about how little he cares

397
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,104
About influencing

398
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:36,896
Narrative

399
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:39,968
Being able to be conduit

400
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:40,736
For bulshit

401
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,064
Marianne Williamson said during the

402
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,136
The debate that was that

403
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:47,904
Was hurt

404
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,672
Discussion

405
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:49,696
The situation

406
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,304
A lot of under-privileged

407
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,072
Communities

408
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:57,888
That. Have you think so

409
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:59,424
Wouldn't be happening in a

410
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:05,824
Large well-to-do city right isn't going to get bad water

411
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,640
And so Alex

412
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:09,408
Play

413
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:10,688
Her commentary

414
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,760
Beyblade

415
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:18,880
Misrepresented

416
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:20,672
Pretend that she's saying that Trump

417
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:21,696
Poisoning

418
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:22,720
Water

419
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:23,488
Or something

420
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:24,768
But you'll see how he uses

421
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,328
Keep in mind

422
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:28,352
But it's also part of

423
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:29,632
40 hour marathon

424
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:30,912
Are you doing a Moneyball

425
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:50,368
You can't trust the government

426
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:55,744
Still filter your own water yourself and the water you shower in you want to live longer

427
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:01,120
Indycar.com

428
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:07,264
Here's that you got it I'm good

429
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:12,384
Yeah I mean it's perfect

430
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:18,528
Marianne Williamson talking about the water in Flint is a perfect opportunity for his water filtration

431
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,904
Really

432
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,928
Prefix

433
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:26,976
Obvious

434
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:31,328
Foreflight

435
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:33,632
She's talking about how it's a problem this week

436
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:36,192
Existed for longer than

437
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:40,544
Have crippled

438
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,712
If you want to create a straw man out of her arguments

439
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,272
But she's saying the Trump is poisoning the water in

440
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:51,040
Implied

441
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:54,112
Yeah you can respond to that has a meaning

442
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,720
Things where you could

443
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:01,536
Say Trump is the direct

444
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:05,120
Originator of this awful thing that the government is doing

445
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:09,984
I better myself

446
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,568
Government has been doing

447
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:17,408
And Trump has exacerbated it to a level that might as well be in a don't Stratus

448
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,456
Explicitly refuses

449
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:20,480
Is 2

450
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,576
Help work towards

451
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:28,416
Worse weather or not

452
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:31,488
Most of the show

453
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:32,768
Has been

454
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,048
Point

455
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:36,096
Using this fake

456
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:37,888
Marion Williams

457
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:38,912
Send winning the debate

458
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:39,680
2

459
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:41,472
Present her is like

460
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:43,008
Whoever ones

461
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:47,616
YouTube The Last Song

462
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:56,320
Over and over and over again

463
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:58,880
Judge knew that I thought Marianne Williamson

464
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:01,952
This is very useful for him anyway

465
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:04,256
Because it first of all allows him to

466
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,024
To paint

467
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,560
So much of the people

468
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:09,632
Democrat as

469
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:12,960
Forbes

470
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:21,408
Heather when she doesn't get the nomination like Squad

471
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:27,808
Narrative over again

472
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,136
I get the feeling that is being set up to

473
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:33,184
Just feel that sort of a role for Alex

474
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:36,000
Somewhere maybe it won't be her baby will be Tulsi

475
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:37,280
Whatever the case is

476
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:43,680
He's trying to establish some sort of a someone else should have run but the Democrat Party so corrupt

477
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:47,264
Paradise Pine

478
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,288
I don't give a s*** about

479
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:49,056
His version of it

480
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,688
There's Nike his own

481
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:55,712
Victimhood

482
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:58,016
Is that real content

483
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:00,064
To it which makes

484
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,368
When he has run out of time

485
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,136
Discover the news

486
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:11,840
Defeat the enemy

487
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:13,888
Then you're truly strong

488
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:29,504
For their own evil

489
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:32,320
Selfishness

490
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,392
Their selfishness is blind

491
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:49,472
What the f*** is happening like that would be parody If if it wasn't his actual show like 80s

492
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:52,032
Rambling about how he's a big strong boy

493
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:56,128
Spark I don't have time to get to

494
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:59,712
The top story

495
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:06,880
You don't have any standard because if you did I would be

496
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:08,160
Not living up to them

497
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:09,952
Better Brew

498
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:12,000
For why you want to be your own

499
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:18,912
Isaac boss

500
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:21,984
Because if no one can stop use no one could stop you from doing

501
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,776
Terrible work like this

502
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:25,312
Just embarrassing

503
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:29,920
I love it

504
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,504
To do that no no

505
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:39,904
Fixation do that a little bit later I don't

506
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:43,488
Episode

507
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:45,536
Talking about how this is going to be like

508
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:46,304
Square Times

509
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,328
100

510
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,656
More importantly

511
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:52,448
I don't mention this visit

512
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:56,032
It seems like he's a

513
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:58,592
Even even in his lies he's already set up at least you had

514
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:05,504
You know just straight-up

515
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:06,528
Provide

516
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:09,344
This is one of them where he explains what do you need

517
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,368
Need the money for

518
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,632
50% off

519
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:26,496
You had this deal going

520
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:34,944
Boys have off everything is big kids

521
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:35,712
Money

522
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:36,736
So we can run

523
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:39,808
Infowars operation

524
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:50,816
Barnes like in the background of the Shadow over his right shoulder

525
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:52,096
Dracula

526
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:56,192
Another room but how much money is making off this rube

527
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:02,336
Calculator

528
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:04,384
Instagram

529
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:05,408
Workouts

530
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:08,224
Oh my God I can't believe this is

531
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:12,576
I don't know I think we're covered stuff he's talking about it probably like

532
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:14,112
Pan Kaitlin Bennett

533
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,136
2 gold

534
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:18,208
Places with a non Infowars microphone

535
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:22,048
Play or like some sort of a knockoff project Veritas Technologies

536
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:31,776
But I don't think that's the case

537
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:33,056
A covert stuff

538
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:34,336
You look at what Alex

539
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:40,736
For what is this world

540
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:42,784
Likely but

541
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,344
Like when Ross Perot hired people

542
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:46,624
Storm

543
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,392
Veterans

544
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:50,720
I don't remember that

545
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:53,280
Ross Perot setup

546
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:00,192
Save-A-Lot

547
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:01,472
Covert operation

548
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:02,496
Into rescue

549
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:05,568
Prisoners of War

550
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:10,944
Eddie built the fake version of a prison and then they tried to go in the prison

551
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:14,272
Don Ross

552
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:17,088
Doing that

553
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:19,136
I think he's probably just paying his lawyers

554
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:22,720
But next time we get to that

555
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:31,168
If you want to to know what the real story is I recommend you read something

556
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:35,264
I'm only going to play this clip

557
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,312
Because I think

558
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:39,616
Straight in Alex trying

559
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:42,688
To cover like just a normal new story which is

560
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,504
China's making overtures that it might

561
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,296
Coming to

562
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:49,088
Protesting

563
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:50,368
Hong Kong

564
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,392
Just that

565
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:52,160
Story

566
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,696
He still has to get f******

567
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:17,504
Extremely

568
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,280
Real blunt

569
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:32,352
Travis is going to get really really really nasty

570
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:33,120
Fast

571
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:35,680
Is a ferocious

572
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:36,704
People

573
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:43,872
Can you do this again when you don't have a boss

574
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:46,944
I guess nobody is really paying attention to him anymore otherwise

575
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,504
Usually

576
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:53,088
Alex murders people

577
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:58,208
Yeah I mean like that

578
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,000
Crazy

579
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:09,984
Yeah I'm in between him thinking that South Koreans are Chinese

580
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:10,752
You got

581
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,312
Express

582
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,336
Exact sentiments

583
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:17,664
The past being somehow

584
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:21,760
Bored genetically violent once they get violent

585
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:28,160
Kamikaze pilots

586
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:30,208
Racist

587
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:31,488
But it wasn't as

588
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:32,768
Is just blanket like

589
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:35,328
Hey anybody from Asia is

590
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:37,888
It never going to end

591
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:40,448
Yeah watch out for Asian blood

592
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,032
Daughter's life is South Korean or whatever

593
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:51,200
Play music like

594
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:53,248
This group of people

595
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,272
By there

596
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:58,880
Predisposition is Viola

597
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:04,256
Immediately just after that

598
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:19,104
Is it not

599
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:24,992
It's almost as if when you see those videos

600
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:27,040
Stoffer

601
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:27,808
To kill anybody

602
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:28,832
Maybe

603
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:30,624
Oh

604
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,512
Man

605
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:37,536
He's a bad human

606
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:41,632
Real bad dude

607
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:42,912
Almost like

608
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:45,984
You proud of himself for his number killing abilities

609
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:54,688
I could kill more people than an Asian who got my career Baptist 6

610
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:04,416
Clark

611
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:06,464
If I got into my Prime if I made it

612
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,280
To the show I'd be knocking 20 30 home runs out of the

613
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:11,072
Hammer

614
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,888
I just think I could I hear these

615
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:15,168
These things

616
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:17,984
Do you know his version of what he likes

617
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,008
To brag about

618
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:20,288
How he likes to

619
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,872
Anthem self up the particular ways

620
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:24,640
He does

621
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:25,920
So gross

622
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:26,944
Childish

623
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:27,968
Stupid

624
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:30,528
Do I have a surprise

625
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:31,808
He is all of those day

626
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:35,648
He does

627
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:41,280
You know I mean I don't know exactly what the actual geopolitical ramifications

628
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:43,072
If China were to

629
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,096
You know

630
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:45,632
Encroach

631
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:46,656
Hong Kong

632
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:51,008
I don't know what the exact consequences

633
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:54,080
Alex believes it will be a giant War

634
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:57,152
And he also thinks otherwise

635
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:58,176
Set a giant War

636
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:59,200
Could start

637
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:01,504
Particular

638
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:05,088
I'm Africa that okay

639
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:11,488
Or or the other half

640
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:15,840
Two areas

641
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:18,400
Wars in the Middle East

642
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:22,496
Another area that's happening

643
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:25,824
Are there in Asia

644
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,720
We can make donations

645
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:45,536
Where you can also purchase products

646
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:49,120
Computer programmer

647
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:51,936
Put together

648
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:55,776
Text messaging Michael

649
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:58,080
Chevron

650
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,920
Was it like 300,000

651
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:22,656
Donations

652
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,592
Yeah in last few days

653
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:31,616
Good

654
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:35,712
But Maurice were selling this stuff no profit

655
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:41,856
Keep pushing

656
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:44,928
Tomorrow we bring a million dollars gross sales

657
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,680
Infowarsstore.com

658
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:57,472
This is a bummer

659
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:59,520
This is not a jubilant

660
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:01,312
Alex

661
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:03,872
During his money bomb

662
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:07,200
Number been real in the morning I think you would be

663
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:11,808
Be pretty excited that is not where he wants to be

664
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,112
In terms of it money bomb

665
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:18,464
Because he also knows that there's so much Dead Space

666
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:22,048
During that 240 hours that no money is coming in

667
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:24,352
Nobody's coming in with Harrison Smith is hosting

668
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:28,704
Almost nothing is probably coming in with David Knight with all his people who are on

669
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:34,848
Amount

670
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:39,200
No one's paying any money for Shroyer's stuff cuz he's

671
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:44,064
Very little opportunity to actually hit his goal probably

672
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,344
Man it feels like

673
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,112
Jackass

674
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:46,880
Your

675
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:48,416
Bragging on air

676
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:50,208
A lament

677
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:51,488
Conair about how

678
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,512
You need

679
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:53,792
Revenue is

680
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:55,840
You don't

681
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:56,864
Care about the price

682
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:05,312
I don't know what I don't I don't

683
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:06,848
Yeah could be

684
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:09,920
I don't know I don't know enough about finances

685
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:10,688
Doesn't know anything

686
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,248
But until just

687
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:15,296
I don't feel like

688
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:17,856
What he's manifest

689
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:21,184
Doing good going great

690
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,208
I don't think

691
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:24,768
Anything is going great

692
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:30,400
I mean it's close to schadenfreude but it's not quite cuz I still don't rejoice and

693
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:32,960
His downfall or anything like that

694
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:35,008
Mildly amused

695
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:37,056
But I'm more interested in like

696
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:38,080
Is actual Subs

697
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:41,664
The arguments and worldviews

698
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,432
Like I said

699
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:45,760
I'm more excited when I find Ally than I am in him

700
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:46,784
Going out of bed

701
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:48,064
Yeah cousin

702
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,624
I still don't like him going out of business

703
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,648
Still

704
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:53,696
Affects a lot of people who are

705
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:54,464
Maybe not

706
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:04,704
Remained at their status

707
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:07,008
That's pretty

708
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:11,104
I feel a little sympathy for his employees would be out of job

709
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:14,688
Another job

710
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:16,736
And

711
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:22,880
Infowars with everybody so

712
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:27,232
I also have millions of dollars even if they got a business

713
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:28,000
Will be fine

714
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:29,024
True

715
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,608
But I would really worry about it there might be

716
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,656
Do this

717
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:38,240
Be one of the few things that's holding a lot of people back

718
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:39,008
From being involved

719
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:39,776
Qanon

720
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:42,080
So we're here to go out of business

721
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:49,504
Pores vacuum paranoia somehow

722
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:52,832
The best next best game in town is

723
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:55,392
Kind of you know jumping over to Key West

724
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:57,440
It might be more Danger

725
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:58,976
I'm not entirely sure

726
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:00,768
So people actually believe in

727
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:09,216
From where we're sitting

728
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:11,520
People pretending to believe

729
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:12,544
But

730
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:15,104
You're just a couple of dead bodies

731
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,408
Yeah that's actually very true

732
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:20,480
So this is not going great

733
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:23,808
The one

734
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,088
But it's going to

735
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:27,392
To get the donations coming in

736
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:29,952
Eating horses would be awesome

737
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:30,720
He chose

738
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:31,744
Something else

739
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,040
Strategically plan

740
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:03,232
How I love the first of all

741
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:05,280
All the f****** time but

742
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:06,560
It's so f****** hilarious

743
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:08,352
Covington kids

744
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:11,936
Yeah the lawsuit against

745
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:14,752
Yeah yeah that's right

746
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:17,056
Because everybody was planning on Robert Barnes

747
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:18,336
Because

748
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:21,408
Presented I'm representing the Covington kids

749
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:27,808
He'll everyone is the rough out I love that Alex's defenses like that was mis case cuz his case

750
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,088
Exist

751
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:32,416
So he was saying that he he was representing the coming

752
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,464
Key is on some

753
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:35,744
Blue Ivy

754
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:42,656
I don't I don't care about the like others of Robert Barnes at scam

755
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:44,192
I just don't have the mental space

756
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:45,472
For all of that

757
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:47,776
I just think it's funny that Alex's defenses

758
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:54,431
He couldn't have his case thrown out cuz there isn't one

759
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:57,759
Even realize

760
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:58,783
I told him

761
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:01,087
To put together

762
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:02,623
And they're still not ready

763
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:03,647
Right

764
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:10,047
Here's the f****** time

765
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:19,007
I just

766
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,311
Can't say enough

767
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:22,079
How

768
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:24,895
Much that is like my kind of Comedy

769
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:25,663
Is like

770
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:28,223
You guys think you're insulting him because

771
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:33,343
He's case got thrown up imaginary

772
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:38,975
Looks like not be a worse go bottle

773
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:42,047
We just bluffing

774
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:45,375
Refreshing

775
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:53,567
My firm conviction is Big he left the coverage of the Democrat debate because you realize like

776
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,871
His skill-set doesn't work well in

777
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:59,199
The setting of the Democrat primary

778
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:01,759
Baby Alive

779
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:07,135
He doesn't have a lot of heat

780
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:11,487
Built up characters in there didn't have it Hillary Clinton

781
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:13,279
Yell at you doesn't have

782
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:19,679
Like he could just do a Bernie voice for 45 minutes but that's exhausting on his throat and people would rightfully

783
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:23,775
Be like later

784
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:24,799
Moving on

785
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:31,199
I mean Impressions good but it's not 45 minutes cut like anything

786
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:34,783
Really on a lot of these people other than superficial complaint

787
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:40,927
Like you can do the same thing that Trump doesn't talk about Native American with Elizabeth Warren

788
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:41,695
Beacon

789
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:44,511
Call them all demons

790
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:49,631
But like I was I was just thinking that's the only one where everybody on it

791
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:53,983
Don't talk about you

792
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:56,031
It's going to come out of your mouth right

793
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:59,103
I think that really

794
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:00,639
Limit his ability

795
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:03,199
I think he's a skillset his diminished

796
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:05,503
Considerably

797
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:08,319
He has take

798
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:09,343
To take

799
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:11,135
Information about these new

800
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:12,159
People and insult them

801
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:14,719
Dismiss them correctly

802
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:17,535
What happened

803
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:18,815
But it turns out

804
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:19,839
That's not what I

805
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:21,375
I was wrong

806
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:23,935
It turns out that Alex just can't handle

807
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:26,495
Looking at Democrats anymore

808
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:44,159
So I went home

809
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:58,239
Washing watching you

810
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:01,311
Thunder shows we do ab watch Tucker Carlson

811
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:07,711
Watching or listening

812
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:12,319
I can only take information through white nationalist leading channels

813
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:16,671
I can only handle my own coverage Trump Tucker and drugs

814
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:22,303
I have become so insulated that I need a safe space to take in information I can't

815
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:26,143
Wild west of a CNN debate

816
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:27,935
How's that is this

817
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:31,007
Yeah that's hiding behind like somehow it's

818
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:32,799
Visually the Democrat

819
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:37,407
Look a certain way that makes me sick

820
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:38,175
Look

821
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:42,527
He doesn't like the idea of looking at others

822
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:43,807
Who disagree with it

823
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:48,927
A healthy democracy

824
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:52,511
That's in the Anti-Federalists

825
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:58,143
Full of s***

826
00:45:58,655 --> 00:45:59,423
Absolutely

827
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:02,495
And to Mexico if we hear him

828
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:04,287
Express

829
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:06,079
Legitimately

830
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:06,847
You do it

831
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:09,151
At least white nationalist of Jason

832
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:11,967
The ideas of demographic anxiety

833
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:16,319
How Alex response

834
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:23,231
Is abortion is increasing in

835
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:29,631
Populations in the West

836
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:38,335
Oceanside

837
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:46,783
You're a smart guy

838
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:54,207
Alex is already said he wants to give Barn to Shoreline

839
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:01,375
I think bars that goes home in sounds like

840
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:03,167
Buckhead mr. Burns

841
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:08,287
Everything is going according to plan

842
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:16,479
Map of Italian.

843
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:23,391
That old first I'll get in with Owen Shroyer and I'll impress him and then now it's cool give me a show

844
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:24,927
Got to have a bunch of

845
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:27,743
Voodoo dolls

846
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:29,791
It's pretty wild

847
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:32,607
Absorb

848
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:35,679
I don't believe that these things

849
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:47,199
I think he's just referencing the idea that says 14 days

850
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:48,479
Did give some grants

851
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,015
You work they like Julian hux

852
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:52,831
He was doing

853
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:57,695
I looked around I can't find

854
00:47:58,719 --> 00:47:59,999
He's talking about

855
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:00,767
Famous book 90

856
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:08,703
So exactly what you are afraid of

857
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:10,495
Alex tries to

858
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:12,287
Comments on mayor

859
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:18,943
No plays a little clip of

860
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:20,223
Having some commentary

861
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:21,759
And yours

862
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:22,527
With Alex

863
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:32,511
By recycling the same arguments policies and politician

864
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:33,279
I've been alive

865
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:34,559
We got this summer

866
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:35,327
The courage

867
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:40,191
Alta commercial

868
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:47,359
I don't know if I heard any other substantial commentary on

869
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:50,943
Episode

870
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:53,247
I've got to

871
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:55,551
F***

872
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:56,575
Need somebody with a

873
00:48:57,343 --> 00:48:58,879
Throwing knives are Dart

874
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:00,927
Throwing them right into his leg

875
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:02,207
Every time

876
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:06,047
Where can I get back on

877
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:10,911
So in this next clip

878
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:11,679
Alex

879
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:15,519
He's still a little bent out of shape about Marianne Williamson

880
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:18,079
Comments about Trump poisoning the water that he believes

881
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:19,103
She made but you did

882
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:21,407
Bright and Sophie

883
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:22,943
But you think they said he would

884
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:24,223
It is easy

885
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:27,295
Cliff again

886
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:32,927
At the tail end of it you start spiraling out about how bad the water is in LA

887
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:38,047
Summit hygiene

888
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:39,327
Routine

889
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:43,167
Why would anybody want to be the victim

890
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:45,471
Toilet

891
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,519
Where they take the sewage

892
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:03,647
Tasted LA water

893
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:10,559
I'm a neat freak

894
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:11,839
Okay

895
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:13,631
Shower

896
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:14,399
What I am

897
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:17,215
Bottles of

898
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:27,455
So I guess

899
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:28,735
Donate to your shoulder

900
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:30,527
When I take a shower in LA

901
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:32,831
Place is a joke

902
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:38,719
Where's the vault

903
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:47,423
I don't know if he's been other times on Covert missions

904
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:52,799
There's a larger definition of

905
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:54,079
I come from

906
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:55,359
Just watch

907
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:56,127
To get that

908
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:03,551
It's the sex workers

909
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:04,575
Thank you very much

910
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:05,855
I apologize

911
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:08,671
To me is about

912
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:11,231
You dick or I guess

913
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:13,279
You're at your genitals

914
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:16,607
With whatever his definition

915
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:18,143
Right

916
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:24,543
Can you imagine another show seriously been like in the middle of some sort of

917
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:29,151
The primary analysis be like in LA

918
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:33,503
We're still in the show right

919
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:35,551
This is just become one

920
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:38,111
Uninterrupted

921
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:41,439
Out loud it's remarkable that

922
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:43,487
It's really crazy

923
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:46,303
It's worth taking seriously is like

924
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:49,887
He's over hatred of people unlike him

925
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:52,191
Himself

926
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:59,871
It should like it deserves to be written off

927
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:00,895
Yeah

928
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:04,223
Alex talks about at the dam

929
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:06,015
Our criminal election fraud

930
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:07,807
That doesn't sound right

931
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:15,999
Mercenaries

932
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:22,143
The people are actually supporting

933
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:25,215
The pools are all fake

934
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:27,007
Cited fake poles

935
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:32,127
That work I completely rigged by trolls

936
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:36,223
I do not trust his assessment of what is not a real poll

937
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:41,343
The power the

938
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:42,111
Conservative

939
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:45,439
Just kidding

940
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:46,207
2

941
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:47,487
Lying about

942
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:48,255
Voter

943
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:49,023
Fraud person

944
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:56,447
Before they before the Democrats pointed out like you guys have been doing all of this

945
00:52:56,703 --> 00:52:57,215
Depression

946
00:52:57,727 --> 00:53:00,287
For forever the reason that you wanted these election

947
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:01,311
Is because you

948
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:06,175
In Michigan electoral college

949
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:11,039
Should not have gone that way

950
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:13,855
Cleveland

951
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:15,391
Call me

952
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:18,207
It it it is it is

953
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:20,511
Not the how easily they own

954
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:32,543
Like if if a Republican

955
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:35,103
Yeah yeah

956
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:38,175
Critic of Mitch McConnell voters

957
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:38,943
Depression

958
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:41,759
Policy ignoring the election

959
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:43,551
Election

960
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:44,831
Security

961
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:46,367
Coming

962
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:47,903
From the right and everybody take

963
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:50,207
Turn on the left

964
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:51,231
You can look at

965
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:55,071
Voter gerrymandering and whatever say and you'll have

966
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:56,351
F****** intercept

967
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:57,119
Going

968
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:01,471
Any good on them for it

969
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:03,007
But that's why the Republicans

970
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:05,823
Sabor of the unity behind

971
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:07,615
Whatever is

972
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:12,735
Next to something that I love

973
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:16,831
I love

974
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:19,391
We know that I love and Alex Jones

975
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:20,159
Story

976
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:22,975
I love it anytime takes a vacation

977
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:24,255
And comes back with

978
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:26,047
Completely not true story

979
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:27,583
Especially

980
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:32,191
CS this is the first time I've heard of this particular story

981
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:33,471
And this has to

982
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:34,751
To do with

983
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:38,335
Ostensibly a conversation about

984
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:42,943
White people virtue signaling that they care about black

985
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:46,783
You shouldn't

986
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:49,087
But I also don't know what not to believe

987
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:53,183
Because this story in a word

988
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:54,207
Is confusing

989
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:55,999
Okay it's convoluted

990
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:08,031
Egyptian king

991
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:09,311
The Roman

992
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:10,335
Keep or whatever

993
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:13,407
We shared a dog

994
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:19,295
Fishing

995
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:23,903
16 hour

996
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:25,183
As She Goes

997
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:26,207
She does

998
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:29,023
What happened

999
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:34,911
I got a birthmark

1000
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:36,191
Flip

1001
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:42,591
The gypsies

1002
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:44,895
Royal people

1003
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:12,543
I love that

1004
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:13,823
Is f******

1005
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:21,503
Make molding with Alex

1006
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:23,039
What the f*** are you talk

1007
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:25,855
What is the point

1008
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:31,743
Are you trying to talk about the Roman 8 because we don't

1009
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:35,327
Fulbright

1010
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:39,935
Who's the Gypsy King

1011
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:42,239
Cuz that's a real person

1012
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:45,311
Digging in your yard looking for Arrowhead

1013
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:50,175
But you let them take it

1014
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:56,575
White woman who accused you hitting your son

1015
00:56:56,831 --> 00:57:01,951
Why are you sure that I know who you are and your kid

1016
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:05,279
What is happening what is going on

1017
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:11,935
Yeah because people that lock their windows I would love to

1018
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:15,775
Prefer Robert eclipse or Alex talks about gamblers

1019
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:20,127
As if they are trying to murder him

1020
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:28,063
The sort of person who don't know who you're sitting next to Barn

1021
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:30,623
Alex's f****** story makes no sense

1022
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:33,439
Barnes is killing at 5 but he says

1023
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:37,279
The two of them are doing nothing but Electric

1024
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:43,935
It's the same sort of I but we got on that old episode where Alex and Jerome corsi we're finishing each other's sentences

1025
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:48,031
Because Barnes is bringing that like

1026
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:49,311
Not only that but

1027
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:52,639
He's doing improv work with Alex

1028
00:57:54,175 --> 00:57:56,223
Crushing it and it did

1029
00:57:56,479 --> 00:57:57,247
It leads them

1030
00:57:57,503 --> 00:57:58,015
Just like

1031
00:57:58,783 --> 00:57:59,807
They go down

1032
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:03,135
Rabbit holes with each other very annoying

1033
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:06,207
But he also means that Alex also doesn't like

1034
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:08,767
Real Subs

1035
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:10,815
Any of the topics he wants

1036
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:11,583
The cover

1037
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:13,119
And it leads him to be very

1038
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:37,439
That also sounds like parody

1039
00:58:37,695 --> 00:58:40,511
Graham Trucking

1040
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:46,911
Start the clip talking about how people don't really care about black people and there's virtue signaling

1041
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:49,471
Absolutely I agree with that

1042
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:55,615
My daughter said took a little star I really want

1043
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:02,271
God dammit

1044
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:07,135
Do you remember when

1045
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:11,999
Citgo on deliver the Nightly News to the world and then be like hold on one second

1046
00:59:12,255 --> 00:59:14,815
I got my my little three-year-old son he's going to

1047
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:17,631
Single song real quick

1048
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:22,751
It's so insane just to imagine any of the behaviors that are manifested on the show existing

1049
00:59:23,007 --> 00:59:23,519
Anywhere else

1050
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:26,847
Doing it. Feeling like

1051
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:30,943
Terrible at this

1052
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:35,807
Trying to do a show that people should take seriously about political topics in like

1053
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:40,415
I'm presenting myself as the only one in the world who gets it but they're like

1054
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:45,023
Centuries-old conspiracy to destroy the west or whatever

1055
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:46,559
And you do s*** like this

1056
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:47,839
Alright

1057
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:54,239
The only reason that we have done over

1058
00:59:54,495 --> 00:59:56,543
300 episodes of our show

1059
00:59:57,055 --> 00:59:59,871
Is because Alex is perhaps the most unique step

1060
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:00,639
Show

1061
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:01,407
Sing

1062
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:04,991
Deez Nuts

1063
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:07,807
Success is like a one in ten billion yet

1064
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:14,207
Like this from somebody who just had a

1065
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:17,791
YouTube channel

1066
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:19,071
Show that's like this

1067
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:22,143
Nobody

1068
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:25,727
Yeah it is

1069
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:26,495
It's wild

1070
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:28,031
Incongruity

1071
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:29,055
It makes no sense

1072
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:32,895
We're going to spend the rest of our lives trying to understand

1073
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:33,663
Perhaps

1074
01:00:34,943 --> 01:00:41,087
Encapsulation of conversation with

1075
01:00:41,343 --> 01:00:41,855
Robert Barnes

1076
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:43,903
He's thrilled with Robert Barnes

1077
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:44,671
His prognosis

1078
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:45,695
Skating ability

1079
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:52,095
Because more people would Google Marianne Williams

1080
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:57,727
Congratulations

1081
01:00:58,495 --> 01:01:04,639
She's on the debate again people could be curious about what she says congratulations you're a psychic

1082
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:07,455
You're amazing

1083
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:13,599
He also predicted Like Bernie was going to get a bump in the polls like most people probably could have predicted that

1084
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:15,647
But anyway

1085
01:01:15,903 --> 01:01:16,415
Alex

1086
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:17,183
He has

1087
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:17,951
Insight

1088
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:19,231
In terms of politics

1089
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:20,255
Andy Bragg

1090
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:27,679
Tomorrow or something and really get with them and Charlotte Michelle tomorrow okay

1091
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:34,079
Activate

1092
01:01:48,927 --> 01:01:50,975
So how you guys actually did this

1093
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:56,095
Fort Campbell

1094
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:03,775
Seriously

1095
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:10,687
Yeah and everything that you say is absolutely.

1096
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:14,271
Storage Wars

1097
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:21,951
It's worth pointing out the gambling on elections is illegal in the United States

1098
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:25,535
Alex literally airfryer

1099
01:02:26,047 --> 01:02:29,119
Recognized as one of the greatest

1100
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:31,167
Politics gamblers

1101
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:36,287
He had to go to Europe to bet on the 2016 election because of the legal in the United States

1102
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:38,079
So

1103
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:40,127
I don't know you could work

1104
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:41,663
It's one of those things that I kind

1105
01:02:41,919 --> 01:02:44,735
Gambling on Sports I don't really think

1106
01:02:44,991 --> 01:02:47,295
As long as you're not involved in the sport

1107
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:52,415
It's generally I think it should be totally legal

1108
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:53,439
Politics

1109
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:54,207
Different

1110
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:57,023
I feel like that's different

1111
01:02:57,535 --> 01:02:58,815
And also it's

1112
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:00,095
When

1113
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:01,375
You are somebody

1114
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:03,167
Who is Mal

1115
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:07,519
I guess a host of political show

1116
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:11,359
When your political partisan I think betting on politics

1117
01:03:11,615 --> 01:03:13,151
Involved

1118
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:15,199
And you gamble on politics

1119
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:16,991
I think that's so dirty

1120
01:03:17,503 --> 01:03:19,551
Coming first of all you're not going

1121
01:03:21,087 --> 01:03:21,599
Rap

1122
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:23,135
Even if it were

1123
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:23,903
Legal

1124
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:25,183
Baby shady as hell

1125
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:37,983
Politico

1126
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:44,383
How do you keep your content neutral if you're gambling for certain

1127
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:45,663
Comes in politics

1128
01:03:45,919 --> 01:03:47,455
You don't you can't

1129
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:50,271
Do everything

1130
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:52,575
In your power to persuade

1131
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:53,343
Towards

1132
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:59,743
The outcome that pays the highest dividend

1133
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:04,351
Not because

1134
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:05,631
Ural make

1135
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:07,167
You know the person who makes

1136
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:08,447
10 bucks off of a game

1137
01:04:09,215 --> 01:04:09,983
When there's a s***

1138
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:12,031
There's going to be a

1139
01:04:19,711 --> 01:04:21,247
I just I think it bears

1140
01:04:21,503 --> 01:04:22,783
Like really pointing this out

1141
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:24,063
Will not

1142
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:27,903
Talking about Barnes being apolitical

1143
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:29,439
About tradition

1144
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:31,999
Right it's also not good

1145
01:04:32,255 --> 01:04:35,327
When Barn says things like he says

1146
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:38,655
Clip that indicate that maybe he doesn't know what Warlock

1147
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:39,679
About a lot of the issue

1148
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:43,519
Skip

1149
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:04,511
What the bloodline

1150
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:11,167
These two dudes are having a first of all I could just take that clip of we have a history of the blood libel and be like yes absolutely

1151
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:15,263
Very accurate Alex operation

1152
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:18,079
Operation has a deep history

1153
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:21,151
Blood libel

1154
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:22,943
Trying to present

1155
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:26,271
And it goes on like the clip goes longer they're very clearly talkin about

1156
01:05:26,783 --> 01:05:29,087
Blake I kept blaming Jews for the crucifix

1157
01:05:30,623 --> 01:05:34,719
The bloodline about accusations of

1158
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:35,743
Jews taking

1159
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:37,535
Christian children abusing their blood

1160
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:39,583
To make matzo

1161
01:05:40,863 --> 01:05:45,215
It's a different thing I'm not understanding and not understanding the historical

1162
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:45,983
Consequences

1163
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:49,567
Of the subject that they're talking about and that they embody

1164
01:05:54,175 --> 01:05:56,735
Bands that sound a lot like when we say global

1165
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:03,391
Really really

1166
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:15,167
I was strange that you use the term blood libel.

1167
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:22,335
F*** you

1168
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:23,359
Anyway

1169
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:24,127
Good work

1170
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:27,967
Infowars Isabel I would say is

1171
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:29,759
A white identity operation

1172
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:33,087
Primary function is to

1173
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:35,135
Launder

1174
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:38,207
Ideas

1175
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:38,975
2

1176
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:41,791
Represent

1177
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:45,887
So it's interesting to hear

1178
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:46,655
Barnes

1179
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:47,679
Say that

1180
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:55,359
It's just a response to think the people who say that

1181
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:56,895
Define respondents

1182
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:01,503
Texas

1183
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:15,839
Rachel phraseology

1184
01:07:16,095 --> 01:07:17,631
I pulled my back out

1185
01:07:17,887 --> 01:07:19,167
Trying to understand that

1186
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:20,447
Yeah

1187
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:21,215
Right

1188
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:24,543
I mean I guess it's positive Spencer the races

1189
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:28,639
I mean outside of that there's not much worthwhile in that in that cliff

1190
01:07:28,895 --> 01:07:30,431
But this is how people

1191
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:31,455
Like Alex

1192
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:33,503
Somebody wants world rationalized

1193
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:35,295
They're dumb political position

1194
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:37,343
Like we are only doing

1195
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:42,975
This because you made us do that you got your left

1196
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:44,255
You know that makes

1197
01:07:44,511 --> 01:07:47,071
Me become but identity politics for white

1198
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:48,607
It's a pathetic

1199
01:07:48,863 --> 01:07:49,631
Is on what you're doing

1200
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:51,167
What you doing

1201
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:52,191
If you guys

1202
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:53,983
If you

1203
01:07:55,007 --> 01:07:56,287
Fallen women

1204
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:00,127
If you would have just

1205
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:01,919
And the loudest

1206
01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:03,967
Go to continue run

1207
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:05,247
We wouldn't have to

1208
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:06,015
To be all white

1209
01:08:06,527 --> 01:08:09,599
Primacy all the time. That's almost literally

1210
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:14,975
I've never heard heard

1211
01:08:15,231 --> 01:08:18,047
Pete buttegeig say you have to do what I say because I'm gay

1212
01:08:18,559 --> 01:08:19,839
Shrek

1213
01:08:22,655 --> 01:08:23,679
The way to

1214
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:25,215
Delegitimize

1215
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:27,263
Already of his position

1216
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:28,543
Now

1217
01:08:29,055 --> 01:08:30,591
I picked up that's Alex

1218
01:08:30,847 --> 01:08:32,127
Doing identity politics

1219
01:08:32,383 --> 01:08:33,151
I don't understand

1220
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:34,943
He's minimizing

1221
01:08:35,455 --> 01:08:35,967
Mayor Pete

1222
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:43,135
I'm only supposed to listen to it because he's gay in his identity

1223
01:08:43,391 --> 01:08:45,695
To demean and to delegitimize

1224
01:08:45,951 --> 01:08:52,095
A point that he doesn't want to take seriously from somebody politically disagrees with identity politics

1225
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:56,447
Can only come from within and without

1226
01:08:57,215 --> 01:09:01,823
Somebody else do you work

1227
01:09:02,591 --> 01:09:03,103
Not

1228
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:04,895
All this is identity politics

1229
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:07,455
And then to crying

1230
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:11,295
I have more respect for

1231
01:09:13,855 --> 01:09:15,135
If they were a little bit more

1232
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:17,439
Willing to own

1233
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:20,767
Going to be like in doubt this is what I feel

1234
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:23,327
Care about my people

1235
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:25,887
I don't care about any of you dumbasses

1236
01:09:26,143 --> 01:09:28,191
I don't think you should be able to vote this is

1237
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:30,495
Our country

1238
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:35,615
I would hate that and I would still be as opposed to it as I am to this

1239
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:38,943
Is there be a moral clarity

1240
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:42,015
On on Alex's party ideas

1241
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:44,831
I don't do this because of their identity politics

1242
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:46,879
I just like the West

1243
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:48,927
Call my b*******

1244
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:51,231
Trick

1245
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:51,999
People who

1246
01:09:53,791 --> 01:09:54,303
Vino

1247
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:55,583
Farless exam

1248
01:09:55,839 --> 01:09:58,399
Lives into believing that something they

1249
01:09:58,911 --> 01:09:59,935
Instinctively know

1250
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:00,703
Is wrong

1251
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:02,239
He's still right

1252
01:10:08,639 --> 01:10:10,431
Messages

1253
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:12,223
You can't run the operation

1254
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:13,247
In any

1255
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:15,039
Marketable

1256
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:16,319
Viable way

1257
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:17,087
If you're on

1258
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:18,367
Text about what you're doing

1259
01:10:18,623 --> 01:10:20,159
You will be relegated

1260
01:10:20,415 --> 01:10:21,183
Do the same

1261
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:22,207
Dustbin

1262
01:10:22,463 --> 01:10:24,511
That David

1263
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:26,303
That storm front is in

1264
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:29,375
You will be put in that same box yet if you speak

1265
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:32,191
What you believe

1266
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:35,263
And the way that you wish the world to operate

1267
01:10:35,519 --> 01:10:37,823
So you hide behind these terms

1268
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:38,591
In order to

1269
01:10:38,847 --> 01:10:41,407
To hide your reality

1270
01:10:41,663 --> 01:10:42,175
So you can

1271
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:45,503
Stream of discourse

1272
01:10:46,015 --> 01:10:46,527
Edit

1273
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:48,831
Pathetic

1274
01:10:49,599 --> 01:10:53,951
Uncontrolled

1275
01:10:54,207 --> 01:10:54,719
Very true

1276
01:10:55,999 --> 01:11:00,351
So if Alex yells about how he thinks for himself

1277
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:03,423
Yeah that's how he knows

1278
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:07,263
Robert Barnes knows what's going to happen in this debate before they happen

1279
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:08,287
Because we all

1280
01:11:08,799 --> 01:11:10,335
Really doesn't sound right

1281
01:11:10,591 --> 01:11:11,103
It's not

1282
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:18,015
If you know who's this

1283
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:26,975
Jobs

1284
01:11:27,231 --> 01:11:33,375
Independence

1285
01:11:48,991 --> 01:11:55,135
What are we doing

1286
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:09,471
Barnes is really

1287
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:11,007
Really

1288
01:12:11,263 --> 01:12:13,311
Tongue roll

1289
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:14,335
Supplicating in

1290
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:16,383
In such a way as to manipulate Alex

1291
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:20,479
Control the entire time

1292
01:12:20,735 --> 01:12:21,503
A Barnes is back

1293
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:23,295
Call 1000%

1294
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:27,647
We noted this on another episode

1295
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:30,719
Smooth transition program

1296
01:12:30,975 --> 01:12:36,095
Like he's one of the most glaring problems analysis

1297
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:37,887
Really forced

1298
01:12:38,143 --> 01:12:41,215
Transition into salesmanship

1299
01:12:41,471 --> 01:12:42,239
That s*** like

1300
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:47,103
No much closer to like

1301
01:12:47,615 --> 01:12:50,175
You can trick people

1302
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:51,711
Better Call Saul

1303
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:53,503
Like he is

1304
01:12:54,015 --> 01:12:54,527
Russia

1305
01:12:56,063 --> 01:12:57,343
Ambulance chaser

1306
01:12:57,599 --> 01:12:58,111
Salesman

1307
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:07,583
Yeah it's kind of scary

1308
01:13:07,839 --> 01:13:09,119
Kind of thought that people had

1309
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:10,399
You know

1310
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:12,191
With with

1311
01:13:13,983 --> 01:13:16,799
Pretend person who believes and acts

1312
01:13:20,383 --> 01:13:22,175
Seems to be a manifestation of like

1313
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:24,735
A slightly better operating hours

1314
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:26,527
Right which is why he'll never be

1315
01:13:27,807 --> 01:13:31,903
Bounce off of his show be boring as s***

1316
01:13:34,207 --> 01:13:35,743
Smarter Trump

1317
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:38,815
Would never get elected because he would never want to be

1318
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:41,119
Conceivable

1319
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:45,215
Makes Alex's show listenable are watchable to anybody

1320
01:13:45,727 --> 01:13:47,519
Is the part that makes him

1321
01:13:49,311 --> 01:13:51,103
So same thing with Trump

1322
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:51,871
Getting

1323
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:54,943
So it is next Cliff Barnes

1324
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:57,503
The Infowars is legit

1325
01:13:57,759 --> 01:13:59,039
Legitimately

1326
01:13:59,295 --> 01:14:00,575
The only Free Press

1327
01:14:01,087 --> 01:14:01,599
In the world

1328
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:02,367
Really

1329
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:09,279
The American Democratic experiment

1330
01:14:11,327 --> 01:14:12,863
Big swing Barn too big

1331
01:14:14,143 --> 01:14:14,655
Transparent

1332
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:17,215
Infowars didn't start

1333
01:14:17,471 --> 01:14:17,983
Until like

1334
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:23,359
The 90 so conceivably before that American democracy was impossible

1335
01:14:24,895 --> 01:14:29,503
Until 1995 or so and Alex got on air

1336
01:14:29,759 --> 01:14:31,039
Start immediately

1337
01:14:32,575 --> 01:14:33,599
I think that that

1338
01:14:35,903 --> 01:14:41,791
Saying only free press in the world and Free Press is necessary for American democracy

1339
01:14:42,303 --> 01:14:45,375
Infowars if it goes so goes democracy

1340
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:47,679
Wow

1341
01:14:50,751 --> 01:14:51,263
Perhaps

1342
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:56,639
Alex mentioned that some of his money that he's trying to raise right

1343
01:14:57,151 --> 01:14:58,687
Yeah it's for covert operation

1344
01:14:59,967 --> 01:15:06,111
Now we still don't really know what those covert operations are even in this next we're not going to find out

1345
01:15:06,367 --> 01:15:08,159
Apology records in the FBI

1346
01:15:08,415 --> 01:15:11,999
Think it's legal fees

1347
01:15:12,767 --> 01:15:15,583
I still think that about

1348
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:17,631
Discusses the covert Ops a little more

1349
01:15:27,103 --> 01:15:29,407
Launch operations

1350
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:37,855
Play too much should I

1351
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:39,391
Let's just say

1352
01:15:39,647 --> 01:15:40,159
White House

1353
01:15:43,743 --> 01:15:45,535
This is all completely

1354
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:50,399
What I think it's legal and lawful and

1355
01:15:50,655 --> 01:15:51,423
Occupying your lawyers

1356
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:54,495
Could be true of legal fees

1357
01:15:54,751 --> 01:15:55,263
Yep

1358
01:15:55,519 --> 01:15:58,079
I don't I don't know what the fuk kind of bulshit he's trying

1359
01:15:58,591 --> 01:15:59,871
China pitcher butt

1360
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:01,663
Whataburger

1361
01:16:02,431 --> 01:16:03,967
So early in the episode I

1362
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:06,015
I mentioned that I got the real sense

1363
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:06,783
That

1364
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:07,551
Yellow

1365
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:08,575
He's

1366
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:14,719
Disgusting waking up in 700,000 and turns out it's really three

1367
01:16:15,231 --> 01:16:17,279
He's not feeling good

1368
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:19,839
And when we get towards the end of the episode

1369
01:16:20,863 --> 01:16:21,887
He breaks it down

1370
01:16:22,143 --> 01:16:23,167
And it's

1371
01:16:23,423 --> 01:16:23,935
It's worse than

1372
01:16:24,447 --> 01:16:25,471
Even I thought

1373
01:16:28,287 --> 01:16:32,895
Rechargeable

1374
01:16:34,943 --> 01:16:35,967
For yourself

1375
01:16:36,223 --> 01:16:37,503
First of all no insertive Robert

1376
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:44,159
Knowing your community that already knows who you are.

1377
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:50,559
Drudge Report

1378
01:16:51,583 --> 01:16:52,607
Maybe a couple people there

1379
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:54,911
What they don't want you to see

1380
01:17:01,311 --> 01:17:02,847
That's why the system is so scary

1381
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:06,687
So what are you saying they're really quick before we get to the rest of the

1382
01:17:06,943 --> 01:17:11,295
Is that you need to spread the word about our harsh

1383
01:17:11,551 --> 01:17:15,647
Find

1384
01:17:15,903 --> 01:17:17,951
That's not true is not true

1385
01:17:18,463 --> 01:17:21,279
They get new people and they stay for a little while and then they leave

1386
01:17:21,535 --> 01:17:24,351
Which is why he's in such a desperate need for new people

1387
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:27,423
Just why the bad pitch that he's doing here starts

1388
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:29,727
With we need you to get the word

1389
01:17:30,495 --> 01:17:32,543
Which is why that's almost as important

1390
01:17:32,799 --> 01:17:34,079
Selling his product

1391
01:17:34,335 --> 01:17:35,871
You need to advertise

1392
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:37,663
Because without that

1393
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:39,199
I don't have

1394
01:17:39,455 --> 01:17:42,271
I don't have new people coming in who I can trick

1395
01:17:42,527 --> 01:17:48,671
Without interesting I am for a little while before they get the sense like this is impotent bulshit this is going nowhere

1396
01:17:48,927 --> 01:17:50,463
Making up most of the stuff probably

1397
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:52,255
I would rather the

1398
01:17:52,511 --> 01:17:53,791
Something else

1399
01:17:54,559 --> 01:17:55,071
Do you know that

1400
01:17:55,327 --> 01:17:56,095
And that's why

1401
01:17:56,863 --> 01:17:59,167
You know you be my advertising

1402
01:17:59,423 --> 01:18:00,191
Network is

1403
01:18:00,447 --> 01:18:01,215
Super important

1404
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:04,287
It doesn't want to

1405
01:18:05,567 --> 01:18:06,079
We're here

1406
01:18:07,871 --> 01:18:08,639
We're strong

1407
01:18:20,415 --> 01:18:21,695
Hilton will shut down

1408
01:18:25,023 --> 01:18:27,071
The problem is I don't order

1409
01:18:30,911 --> 01:18:34,239
Which

1410
01:18:53,951 --> 01:18:54,463
What

1411
01:18:54,975 --> 01:18:57,791
Have you bought products at Walmart or Target

1412
01:18:58,047 --> 01:19:00,351
Future

1413
01:19:00,607 --> 01:19:02,911
Just code enforcer.com make a straight donation

1414
01:19:07,519 --> 01:19:11,359
Ouachita

1415
01:19:13,151 --> 01:19:17,759
I I know that we've heard a number of times him talk about the impending doom

1416
01:19:18,015 --> 01:19:18,527
Infowars

1417
01:19:18,783 --> 01:19:20,831
That's why I don't I don't know how seriously.

1418
01:19:21,343 --> 01:19:22,623
Any of that

1419
01:19:22,879 --> 01:19:23,903
Like he's embellishing

1420
01:19:24,415 --> 01:19:25,183
Like

1421
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:30,047
There's a resign this to it in the last couple

1422
01:19:30,303 --> 01:19:32,607
There has been a ramping up in a more frequent

1423
01:19:34,911 --> 01:19:35,423
Yeah

1424
01:19:37,983 --> 01:19:39,519
Might be feeling

1425
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:43,359
Imminent

1426
01:19:44,895 --> 01:19:45,663
4

1427
01:19:46,431 --> 01:19:49,503
I think for independent businesses

1428
01:19:50,015 --> 01:19:51,039
While they were in the

1429
01:19:51,295 --> 01:19:52,319
The middle of going out of business

1430
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:54,367
That sound

1431
01:19:54,879 --> 01:19:55,391
Very familiar

1432
01:19:57,695 --> 01:19:58,975
Very familiar

1433
01:19:59,231 --> 01:20:03,327
Yeah I don't like I said I've learned my lesson in the past

1434
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:04,607
With

1435
01:20:04,863 --> 01:20:05,887
He says

1436
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:07,935
Even if

1437
01:20:08,191 --> 01:20:09,727
Even if it's what you want

1438
01:20:09,983 --> 01:20:11,007
To believe is true

1439
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:11,775
Sound

1440
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:12,799
Sincere

1441
01:20:13,055 --> 01:20:13,824
It could be

1442
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:16,640
That just beating another marketing tactic is using

1443
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:22,528
The idea of very

1444
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:23,296
The troops

1445
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:25,088
And get them to give him the money that he need

1446
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:26,112
I don't know

1447
01:20:26,368 --> 01:20:27,392
I don't know

1448
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:29,184
I would say

1449
01:20:29,696 --> 01:20:30,464
But if he is being

1450
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:31,488
Insincere in anyway

1451
01:20:32,256 --> 01:20:34,048
This is

1452
01:20:36,864 --> 01:20:38,400
Should not be launching operation

1453
01:20:38,656 --> 01:20:41,216
Not be trying to pay Kaitlin Bennett

1454
01:20:41,472 --> 01:20:45,568
To go do whatever paying all of these reporters

1455
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:47,104
And

1456
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:48,384
Just Folk

1457
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:50,688
He's mission

1458
01:20:50,944 --> 01:20:51,712
What he wants

1459
01:20:52,736 --> 01:20:54,784
He could do for Sochi

1460
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:58,368
There is no reason why he can't fight the globalist

1461
01:20:58,624 --> 01:21:00,160
Exactly the same way he's doing

1462
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:03,232
Get the same information out probably better

1463
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:04,512
Torchy's

1464
01:21:05,024 --> 01:21:05,536
Almost

1465
01:21:06,048 --> 01:21:06,560
Possibly

1466
01:21:07,328 --> 01:21:08,608
He is overextended

1467
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:09,632
Because

1468
01:21:10,144 --> 01:21:11,936
He doesn't care about that that's not the message

1469
01:21:13,216 --> 01:21:14,496
His delusion

1470
01:21:15,264 --> 01:21:17,312
Like it's a big party because

1471
01:21:17,568 --> 01:21:18,336
Village Inn

1472
01:21:18,592 --> 01:21:20,640
The legitimacy of his operation

1473
01:21:21,152 --> 01:21:22,688
Is only ever going to

1474
01:21:23,456 --> 01:21:24,224
Compared to

1475
01:21:24,992 --> 01:21:31,136
CNN Studios

1476
01:21:31,392 --> 01:21:33,440
He'll look at that studio

1477
01:21:33,696 --> 01:21:34,464
Listen to work everyday

1478
01:21:34,976 --> 01:21:36,000
Look at how small it is and

1479
01:21:36,768 --> 01:21:37,536
What am I doing

1480
01:21:38,816 --> 01:21:39,328
I'm never going to be

1481
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:44,448
I'm so glad I disabuse myself of any Notions like that pretty early on in podcasting

1482
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:46,496
Like when I was

1483
01:21:46,752 --> 01:21:48,544
First starting I just had a 4-track

1484
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:49,568
It was terrible

1485
01:21:49,824 --> 01:21:50,336
What time does almond

1486
01:21:50,848 --> 01:21:51,616
And I do like I do

1487
01:21:51,872 --> 01:21:55,200
See the pictures of professional recording studios in a

1488
01:21:55,456 --> 01:21:56,224
That's what I mean

1489
01:21:57,504 --> 01:21:58,272
Like if I could get to

1490
01:21:58,528 --> 01:21:59,552
To the point where I have that

1491
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:01,344
Everything will be great

1492
01:22:02,112 --> 01:22:03,904
And so I spend a ton of money

1493
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:10,304
And I got like microphone arms to hold the mics on and really professional

1494
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:16,192
This isn't satisfying and arms were weird

1495
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:23,616
It just wasn't

1496
01:22:23,872 --> 01:22:27,200
Wasn't what I thought it was going to be I realized the clearance

1497
01:22:27,456 --> 01:22:29,248
Holding a mic and just recording

1498
01:22:30,272 --> 01:22:31,552
If that's all you need

1499
01:22:34,368 --> 01:22:35,136
Can't remember which one

1500
01:22:36,416 --> 01:22:36,928
Which show that we

1501
01:22:39,232 --> 01:22:39,744
Arm

1502
01:22:41,024 --> 01:22:44,608
I was like moving back I can't do I can't cuz I do

1503
01:22:44,864 --> 01:22:50,752
Around all the time I can't do that kind of like a weird

1504
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:54,592
Experience but like I I don't have any

1505
01:22:54,848 --> 01:22:56,128
Conception of my mind is like

1506
01:22:56,384 --> 01:22:57,408
If this grows

1507
01:22:57,664 --> 01:23:00,480
To the point where we're making Alex Jones money

1508
01:23:00,992 --> 01:23:06,880
That somehow I would need to have like a TV wall behind me

1509
01:23:07,136 --> 01:23:09,440
Exactly right here but maybe we both have insurance

1510
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:12,000
It's not to me because

1511
01:23:12,512 --> 01:23:13,280
We can

1512
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:15,072
Do the show that we're doing

1513
01:23:16,352 --> 01:23:17,888
No amount of money would make

1514
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:19,168
The content

1515
01:23:19,424 --> 01:23:19,936
Better

1516
01:23:20,704 --> 01:23:21,984
Island Casino

1517
01:23:22,496 --> 01:23:23,776
That he can't do

1518
01:23:24,544 --> 01:23:25,312
What he does

1519
01:23:25,568 --> 01:23:26,336
Without

1520
01:23:27,104 --> 01:23:27,872
Millions of dollars

1521
01:23:28,128 --> 01:23:29,408
Yeah and that is

1522
01:23:29,664 --> 01:23:30,432
His vanity

1523
01:23:30,688 --> 01:23:31,968
Right

1524
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:33,248
And that is

1525
01:23:34,016 --> 01:23:35,296
Deceitful to his audience

1526
01:23:36,064 --> 01:23:39,136
Like if they really loved and Auntie globalist message

1527
01:23:39,392 --> 01:23:40,416
Janae really love

1528
01:23:40,672 --> 01:23:43,744
His analysis of the world and all that s***

1529
01:23:48,096 --> 01:23:50,144
Alex Jones podcast out of his garage

1530
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:50,912
Steph

1531
01:23:53,216 --> 01:23:54,496
Owns a house

1532
01:23:56,544 --> 01:23:59,616
Podcasting equipment that he could get like for $1,000

1533
01:23:59,872 --> 01:24:03,456
Would be better than 90% of podcast

1534
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:04,224
Yep

1535
01:24:06,272 --> 01:24:08,064
Do that oh wait he's kicked off I2

1536
01:24:09,088 --> 01:24:09,600
I got the cat

1537
01:24:12,672 --> 01:24:13,952
But even happier doing

1538
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:16,000
Mega millions of dollars

1539
01:24:19,584 --> 01:24:21,376
While we while I was working

1540
01:24:26,496 --> 01:24:27,520
How how are

1541
01:24:28,288 --> 01:24:29,568
Dreams are so like

1542
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:32,384
You got a million dollars

1543
01:24:32,896 --> 01:24:34,176
And you didn't have to worry about work

1544
01:24:34,432 --> 01:24:35,200
What would you do

1545
01:24:37,504 --> 01:24:40,320
You stand up for like a hundred people and not really worried about it

1546
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:42,112
That's my goal

1547
01:24:42,368 --> 01:24:45,440
Dream job that I just use all that money

1548
01:24:45,696 --> 01:24:46,208
I have no

1549
01:24:47,232 --> 01:24:48,000
A big house

1550
01:24:48,512 --> 01:24:50,816
Or bladadah

1551
01:24:51,072 --> 01:24:52,352
Live the most creatively

1552
01:24:52,608 --> 01:24:58,752
Satisfying way I can a greedy stack of goo

1553
01:25:00,544 --> 01:25:01,568
It's the most dishonest

1554
01:25:01,824 --> 01:25:03,360
Most awful about it

1555
01:25:03,616 --> 01:25:04,384
Is the wave

1556
01:25:04,896 --> 01:25:05,408
Uses

1557
01:25:06,688 --> 01:25:09,248
What I described is understandable emotions

1558
01:25:09,504 --> 01:25:10,016
His audience

1559
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:11,552
In order to fuel his own

1560
01:25:12,064 --> 01:25:17,440
Because a lot of the audience is probably feeling deprived of something in their own life

1561
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:19,488
Or whether it's real or not

1562
01:25:19,744 --> 01:25:21,792
You know those feelings

1563
01:25:22,048 --> 01:25:23,072
Stem from

1564
01:25:23,328 --> 01:25:24,608
Actual

1565
01:25:26,144 --> 01:25:27,168
Problems or from

1566
01:25:27,424 --> 01:25:28,704
Steve ones that the

1567
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:30,240
The media wolves

1568
01:25:30,496 --> 01:25:31,776
Work up in people's mind

1569
01:25:33,056 --> 01:25:34,336
I believe

1570
01:25:34,592 --> 01:25:37,152
He's taking those things given them an enemy

1571
01:25:37,664 --> 01:25:38,688
And saying he's fighting a

1572
01:25:38,944 --> 01:25:39,968
For them

1573
01:25:40,224 --> 01:25:41,248
Is it Direct

1574
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:46,880
Way that you can get involved in that fight is either promote for me or give me money

1575
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:48,160
It's deeply abusive

1576
01:25:48,672 --> 01:25:50,208
3D don't appreciate it

1577
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:52,768
Are you taking the

1578
01:25:53,024 --> 01:25:53,536
Problems

1579
01:25:54,816 --> 01:25:56,096
And exploiting them

1580
01:25:56,864 --> 01:25:57,376
2

1581
01:25:57,888 --> 01:25:58,656
Give them a

1582
01:25:59,168 --> 01:25:59,680
Different

1583
01:25:59,936 --> 01:26:00,448
Perceived

1584
01:26:01,216 --> 01:26:02,496
If if people

1585
01:26:02,752 --> 01:26:05,056
If all the money that everybody

1586
01:26:05,568 --> 01:26:07,104
Is that everybody to listen game

1587
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:08,128
To Infowars

1588
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:09,152
Did their hands

1589
01:26:09,408 --> 01:26:09,920
And they used it

1590
01:26:10,432 --> 01:26:10,944
Figure out what

1591
01:26:11,456 --> 01:26:11,968
He was

1592
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:13,248
The issue that is

1593
01:26:14,272 --> 01:26:15,040
Infowars

1594
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:18,880
We might have far more well-adjusted

1595
01:26:20,416 --> 01:26:20,928
Yeah

1596
01:26:21,184 --> 01:26:27,072
Misdirected energy

1597
01:26:27,328 --> 01:26:28,864
You can't afford your medical bills

1598
01:26:29,376 --> 01:26:30,656
That's because the global

1599
01:26:30,912 --> 01:26:31,936
Medical Center

1600
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:37,568
They're all over the hmos and they're all trying to

1601
01:26:37,824 --> 01:26:39,872
What train fix the medical system

1602
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:41,408
I got to fix the globalist

1603
01:26:43,712 --> 01:26:44,736
Fixing

1604
01:26:44,992 --> 01:26:47,296
The globalist by funding Alex's TWRP

1605
01:26:47,552 --> 01:26:50,112
Keto of Truth in the Infowars

1606
01:26:50,368 --> 01:26:52,416
Will fix the health system

1607
01:26:52,672 --> 01:26:53,952
I guess I'll

1608
01:26:54,464 --> 01:26:55,232
Give you my money

1609
01:26:55,488 --> 01:26:56,000
And wait

1610
01:26:56,512 --> 01:26:58,048
For the results to come back

1611
01:26:58,304 --> 01:26:58,816
Right

1612
01:26:59,072 --> 01:27:00,352
He's stymies peoples

1613
01:27:01,888 --> 01:27:03,680
Motivation towards solving their problems

1614
01:27:04,704 --> 01:27:05,216
Because

1615
01:27:05,728 --> 01:27:06,752
Doing so

1616
01:27:07,008 --> 01:27:07,520
Makes him money

1617
01:27:08,544 --> 01:27:09,312
And it's shity

1618
01:27:12,384 --> 01:27:13,664
It's a real shity thing to do

1619
01:27:14,944 --> 01:27:15,456
It's profitable

1620
01:27:20,832 --> 01:27:26,976
How was it was when he had it

1621
01:27:27,232 --> 01:27:28,000
The inflow of people

1622
01:27:28,512 --> 01:27:32,096
The inflow of people is really what screwed him over

1623
01:27:32,608 --> 01:27:34,912
Like that disruption of the cycle

1624
01:27:35,936 --> 01:27:37,728
Completely devastating to his business

1625
01:27:39,264 --> 01:27:40,800
What we're seeing is a ramification

1626
01:27:41,056 --> 01:27:41,568
Can do that

1627
01:27:44,128 --> 01:27:44,640
You made your bed

1628
01:27:46,688 --> 01:27:48,736
Speak now it says daughter

1629
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:54,880
We're not going to play her singing Twinkle Twinkle Little Star

1630
01:27:55,648 --> 01:27:56,160
I believe that you

1631
01:27:56,416 --> 01:27:57,184
She deserves her privacy

1632
01:27:58,976 --> 01:27:59,488
I would say

1633
01:27:59,744 --> 01:28:00,256
I don't want to

1634
01:28:00,512 --> 01:28:02,304
How do I turn this into a thing where we like

1635
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:05,888
Turn into the judges on American Idol

1636
01:28:08,704 --> 01:28:09,216
But

1637
01:28:09,472 --> 01:28:12,544
Point out how Alex uses

1638
01:28:13,312 --> 01:28:13,824
The

1639
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:16,384
Clip that he recorded of his daughter singing

1640
01:28:16,896 --> 01:28:18,176
In order to help with an error

1641
01:28:18,944 --> 01:28:20,224
Because I think that's all so pretty

1642
01:28:21,504 --> 01:28:26,112
Breakfast

1643
01:28:27,392 --> 01:28:28,672
I just looked at

1644
01:28:28,928 --> 01:28:30,464
No that's good

1645
01:28:31,232 --> 01:28:32,768
Future

1646
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:37,120
The universe

1647
01:28:38,144 --> 01:28:38,656
Thought about

1648
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:41,984
Future

1649
01:28:46,848 --> 01:28:50,944
He was 10 years old

1650
01:28:52,992 --> 01:28:53,504
Before we get to

1651
01:28:54,528 --> 01:28:55,552
Point where they

1652
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:57,344
The daughter comes in

1653
01:28:58,112 --> 01:28:59,904
You may notice what he's doing

1654
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:02,976
He's using his image of his daughter singing Twinkle Twinkle Little Star

1655
01:29:03,232 --> 01:29:04,512
Is an image of Innocence

1656
01:29:04,768 --> 01:29:06,560
To juxtaposed with the globalist

1657
01:29:07,072 --> 01:29:09,888
Who want to destroy the futures of the children

1658
01:29:11,424 --> 01:29:11,936
Blood libel

1659
01:29:13,472 --> 01:29:16,288
This is probably

1660
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:18,336
The protocols of the Elders of Zion

1661
01:29:18,592 --> 01:29:20,640
Number nine

1662
01:29:21,152 --> 01:29:27,296
We have fooled but used in corrupted the Youth of the goyim by principles

1663
01:29:27,552 --> 01:29:28,320
False although

1664
01:29:28,576 --> 01:29:31,136
Has been inculcated

1665
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:33,952
Or how about this for protocol number 16

1666
01:29:34,208 --> 01:29:39,584
We must introduce into their education all those principles brilliantly broken up their order

1667
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:42,400
But when we are in power we shall remove every kind of

1668
01:29:42,656 --> 01:29:47,264
Disturbing subject from the course of Education in Jamaica

1669
01:29:47,776 --> 01:29:50,592
Loving loving him

1670
01:29:52,384 --> 01:29:52,896
Decent quiet

1671
01:29:53,664 --> 01:29:57,504
I have corrupted the children

1672
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:04,160
These ideas of corrupting the innocence of the children as an attack setting up a one world government

1673
01:30:04,416 --> 01:30:06,464
Are very Central to Alex's worldview

1674
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:09,536
And they trace back directly to the protocols of the Elders of Zion

1675
01:30:10,304 --> 01:30:11,072
This is bulshit

1676
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:12,352
Alex

1677
01:30:12,608 --> 01:30:14,400
Representation of the globalist

1678
01:30:15,168 --> 01:30:15,936
Is all

1679
01:30:16,192 --> 01:30:17,472
Or mostly Atlee

1680
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:20,288
Taken directly from archaic

1681
01:30:20,544 --> 01:30:21,312
Anti-semitism

1682
01:30:22,848 --> 01:30:23,616
Medic ideas

1683
01:30:23,872 --> 01:30:26,688
About these Jews were trying to take over the world

1684
01:30:26,944 --> 01:30:28,480
When you look at these sorts of things

1685
01:30:28,736 --> 01:30:30,016
You see all of these people

1686
01:30:30,272 --> 01:30:30,784
In his

1687
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:33,088
Beer also that are

1688
01:30:33,344 --> 01:30:35,392
People who have been lunch about it

1689
01:30:35,648 --> 01:30:38,720
Young people like the David Jay Smith of the world

1690
01:30:38,976 --> 01:30:41,536
The people who have

1691
01:30:42,304 --> 01:30:45,376
The people that he looks at as a new world order icons

1692
01:30:46,144 --> 01:30:49,728
These people all were very clear that they think it's a Jews who run the world

1693
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:52,800
So when you have Alex doing all this

1694
01:30:53,056 --> 01:30:56,896
All these narrative that are so Central to his ideas about the globalist

1695
01:30:57,152 --> 01:30:57,920
Adjust mirroring

1696
01:30:58,176 --> 01:30:58,688
Protocols

1697
01:30:59,200 --> 01:30:59,968
It's just

1698
01:31:00,224 --> 01:31:00,736
Lame

1699
01:31:01,248 --> 01:31:02,016
Just f****** lame

1700
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:03,552
Also

1701
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:12,256
Quit Alex order another shipment Alex

1702
01:31:14,048 --> 01:31:19,936
Retired Forest hook for like

1703
01:31:20,192 --> 01:31:23,520
Yeah that's true Barnes doesn't want to take over his sinking ship

1704
01:31:23,776 --> 01:31:27,104
He's better at the edge

1705
01:31:30,944 --> 01:31:35,808
Yeah

1706
01:31:38,112 --> 01:31:44,256
No, go away and then Alex can be free of this this monstrosity

1707
01:31:44,768 --> 01:31:45,280
Is created

1708
01:31:46,304 --> 01:31:49,120
Spell it as a franchise than you got Barnes Wars

1709
01:31:49,376 --> 01:31:50,912
You got Owens Wars

1710
01:31:51,424 --> 01:31:52,704
You got Rodger Wars

1711
01:31:53,472 --> 01:31:56,800
Tazadaqyah Imagine The Hangover a lot of these people are going to have

1712
01:31:57,056 --> 01:31:57,568
Like if

1713
01:31:57,824 --> 01:31:58,848
Infowars goes away

1714
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:01,664
I imagine they all have to run

1715
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:03,712
Brazil

1716
01:32:04,224 --> 01:32:05,504
Get taken up to the Hague convention

1717
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:11,648
They're going to Boys from Brazil that's all I got interesting image to have in your head

1718
01:32:11,904 --> 01:32:12,416
Certainly

1719
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:17,280
The world does go the worst possible Direction

1720
01:32:17,792 --> 01:32:23,936
I think there is an argument I think there is an argument to be made for whenever everything clears up

1721
01:32:24,192 --> 01:32:26,496
Responsibility

1722
01:32:28,288 --> 01:32:29,312
More realistically

1723
01:32:29,824 --> 01:32:31,104
If they go out of business

1724
01:32:31,872 --> 01:32:32,384
Because

1725
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:33,152
Yeah you can't

1726
01:32:39,296 --> 01:32:40,576
What's Owen Shroyer going to

1727
01:32:40,832 --> 01:32:41,344
Do

1728
01:32:41,856 --> 01:32:43,392
He's unemployed

1729
01:32:43,648 --> 01:32:44,416
Pipefitters Union

1730
01:32:44,672 --> 01:32:46,720
I'll just go work for one America News Network

1731
01:32:47,232 --> 01:32:48,256
Look at a job at Breitbart

1732
01:32:48,768 --> 01:32:52,096
Family business

1733
01:32:52,352 --> 01:32:53,376
Go become a plumber

1734
01:32:53,632 --> 01:32:55,424
St.Louis

1735
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:59,520
I think he would be happier

1736
01:32:59,776 --> 01:33:01,056
If it was just a goddamn plum

1737
01:33:01,568 --> 01:33:04,384
Will be happier if they weren't career Liars

1738
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:08,992
Obviously the end of this present day episode

1739
01:33:10,784 --> 01:33:13,088
Debate analysis

1740
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:15,904
Is then

1741
01:33:19,744 --> 01:33:20,512
Where was apart of it

1742
01:33:21,792 --> 01:33:24,352
So we learned

1743
01:33:24,608 --> 01:33:25,120
Centipede

1744
01:33:25,376 --> 01:33:26,400
Because he's gay

1745
01:33:26,656 --> 01:33:29,472
Marianne Williamson

1746
01:33:29,728 --> 01:33:33,056
Poisoning Detroit and his take on

1747
01:33:33,312 --> 01:33:34,336
Bernie and Warren

1748
01:33:34,592 --> 01:33:40,736
Absolutely kicking ass positive

1749
01:33:40,992 --> 01:33:47,136
You want to bring up after that debate I can't guarantee it but I don't think I even heard him do this Bernie impression

1750
01:33:47,392 --> 01:33:47,904
Episode

1751
01:33:48,672 --> 01:33:50,208
Yeah you might have that one

1752
01:33:50,464 --> 01:33:52,000
Pointers

1753
01:33:52,512 --> 01:33:54,816
Rememberable it wasn't it I don't remember it happening

1754
01:33:55,584 --> 01:33:58,656
Yeah I think clearer

1755
01:33:59,168 --> 01:33:59,936
Sensational topics

1756
01:34:00,448 --> 01:34:06,592
Absolutely leader in the clubhouse

1757
01:34:06,848 --> 01:34:09,152
He talked about the other people

1758
01:34:10,432 --> 01:34:14,528
Fox News

1759
01:34:14,784 --> 01:34:16,064
20 candidates on the

1760
01:34:17,088 --> 01:34:17,856
Is because

1761
01:34:18,112 --> 01:34:19,136
If you have

1762
01:34:19,392 --> 01:34:19,904
You know

1763
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:21,952
With ideas

1764
01:34:22,464 --> 01:34:22,976
Warning

1765
01:34:23,232 --> 01:34:23,744
Sanders

1766
01:34:26,048 --> 01:34:27,328
It's going to be

1767
01:34:27,584 --> 01:34:28,096
Riveting

1768
01:34:28,608 --> 01:34:32,960
Two people slightly disagree with each other

1769
01:34:35,264 --> 01:34:36,544
Warren and Sanders trying

1770
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:38,592
To do good and then ate moderate

1771
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:41,152
Throwing bulshit bombs at them

1772
01:34:41,408 --> 01:34:42,176
Weather Sienna

1773
01:34:42,432 --> 01:34:43,968
Moderators themselves are like

1774
01:34:44,224 --> 01:34:46,016
Your ideas are stupid and fanciful

1775
01:34:46,528 --> 01:34:50,624
Do you agree what's your comment

1776
01:34:51,392 --> 01:34:52,160
Design to make

1777
01:34:52,416 --> 01:34:53,440
Warren Sanders look

1778
01:34:53,696 --> 01:34:54,208
Ridiculous

1779
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:01,888
I guess like I mean I'm not

1780
01:35:02,144 --> 01:35:03,936
Super interested in Alex's

1781
01:35:04,448 --> 01:35:05,216
Coverage of the second

1782
01:35:05,472 --> 01:35:07,264
Much like Robert

1783
01:35:07,776 --> 01:35:08,544
I'm psychic

1784
01:35:09,056 --> 01:35:09,568
Absolutely

1785
01:35:09,824 --> 01:35:13,152
Alex made a lot of hay out of jail

1786
01:35:13,408 --> 01:35:14,944
Speaking Joe Biden

1787
01:35:16,224 --> 01:35:21,088
I would rather

1788
01:35:21,344 --> 01:35:23,136
Make fun of

1789
01:35:24,416 --> 01:35:28,000
I don't need to hear Alex duet

1790
01:35:28,512 --> 01:35:30,816
If I'm going to look for Joe Biden criticism

1791
01:35:31,072 --> 01:35:34,144
I'm going to go with people

1792
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:37,216
Don't need to go to Alex for that which is just another indication of

1793
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:42,848
I will be back on Monday with another episode but show is stupid

1794
01:35:43,104 --> 01:35:43,616
In the present day

1795
01:35:44,128 --> 01:35:45,920
Repeat that whenever

1796
01:35:46,176 --> 01:35:48,736
Video president of Sodexo sucks

1797
01:35:53,088 --> 01:35:56,416
But it is important

1798
01:36:02,048 --> 01:36:05,888
10 people

1799
01:36:06,912 --> 01:36:12,288
I would say a person have to die within those two minutes or can you just inflicted the damage that kills them

1800
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:15,872
It doesn't count if you die like 2 days later from complications

1801
01:36:16,128 --> 01:36:20,480
I think you get partial credit

1802
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:23,040
Six-and-a-half

1803
01:36:23,296 --> 01:36:24,320
Here's the issue

1804
01:36:24,576 --> 01:36:25,600
What kind of hammer we talkin

1805
01:36:27,392 --> 01:36:33,536
No.

1806
01:36:33,792 --> 01:36:35,328
Music

1807
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:38,912
You are going to be easily deflected

1808
01:36:39,424 --> 01:36:41,472
I think if you could apply at a very doable

1809
01:36:41,728 --> 01:36:45,312
Play 30 Seconds To swing is?

1810
01:36:45,568 --> 01:36:47,104
Clock

1811
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:48,384
Right

1812
01:36:49,152 --> 01:36:50,944
Still harder to kill

1813
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:51,968
What's the question

1814
01:37:04,768 --> 01:37:05,280
In 2 minutes

1815
01:37:07,072 --> 01:37:13,216
Dot-com

1816
01:37:14,496 --> 01:37:16,288
You can you could go to I-10

1817
01:37:18,336 --> 01:37:21,152
You could leave a review if you wanted to

1818
01:37:21,408 --> 01:37:22,944
You could find your nearest

1819
01:37:23,968 --> 01:37:25,248
I stared directly

1820
01:37:25,504 --> 01:37:27,040
Intuit once you realize that it is

1821
01:37:28,064 --> 01:37:28,576
Back at you

1822
01:37:28,832 --> 01:37:29,856
You will receive a

1823
01:37:30,112 --> 01:37:30,624
Small comment

1824
01:37:31,392 --> 01:37:32,416
Fill out

1825
01:37:32,672 --> 01:37:33,952
Reaction to our podcast

1826
01:37:36,256 --> 01:37:37,024
We will send you a

1827
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:39,072
You bet

1828
01:37:40,096 --> 01:37:46,240
Until next time I would save the imaginary people digging up arrowheads in Alex's lake house

1829
01:37:46,496 --> 01:37:49,824
Yard probably haven't killed anybody

1830
01:38:03,648 --> 01:38:07,488
I love your work
