We're couple dudes like to sit around

3
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:14,336
Drink red wine talk about Alex Jones

4
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:15,616
Then wait for death

5
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:19,968
There's been a change this week

6
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:27,136
Probably the best way to put in water and waiting for death

7
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:28,416
Time

8
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:30,208
Boy boy

9
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:32,256
Build a bunker

00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,632
Too like I got to go to Infowars store.com

00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:40,192
Radiation

00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:46,592
Vinh phuc yea we're at but it might finally we discovered that there's one good thing like

13
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:48,896
Alex Jones

14
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:51,456
The entire human race think what he has

15
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:57,088
Anyway to the shows that I know so much better

16
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,928
I'm at is where we find our Middle Ground

17
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:03,232
We might know a little bit

18
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:09,120
Might be closer to buy we educate and inform in the meantime

19
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:10,144
Hopefully

20
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,936
We entertain you know what you know what

21
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:16,032
I was because I'm impossible to listen to

22
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:19,872
It's

23
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:20,896
Damn folks

24
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:22,944
Probably some Jordan photo

25
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,784
Probably some kind of annoying

26
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,808
And vice versa

27
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,648
Yeah

28
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:32,416
Sublimate

29
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:34,976
Sound off on Twitter

30
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:41,376
Destroy both of our self-esteem

31
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:42,400
For a safe space

32
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:49,824
I'm a policy wonk for you Bryan Burger thank you very much

33
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,104

35
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,968
Donators

36
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:00,576
You also

37
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:04,928
You can or we have and if we have any Alex Jones listeners that's the real problem

38
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,512
He's an old friend of mine on the night before his wedding

39
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:11,584
Almost beat me up over a sink

40
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:12,608
He's a good man

41
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:14,400
Before

42
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,424
How did the wedding go

43
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,544
What it was fine I got too drunk at the reception though it might've

44
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,568
No ice

45
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:23,360
Ikaraoke Strokin

46
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:26,688
And didn't realize that there were still children present at the reception

47
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:30,528
It was a it was a Knight of Cups on my part

48
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:34,112
I get to what are episodes

49
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:35,392
I told you before we started

50
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:38,208
Unlike a lot of episodes we've ever done in the past

51
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:41,024
First I want to start with an out-of-context drop

52
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,560
I have nothing to do

53
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,840
With what we talked about on today though

54
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:49,984
Baby shots

55
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:56,384
As well

56
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,368
I don't like any of what's going on out there

57
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,416
That was

58
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,696
A long

59
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:10,976
Time for them to do that

60
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:15,072
Little round table about

61
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:19,168
That was some of their deep analysis

62
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:23,008
It went way off the rails

63
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,944
They just showed that some indication of like how the show has been the last

64
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,712
Few days

65
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:32,992
It's been a disaster

66
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,784
Okay

67
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:38,368
There goes another one another baby dies

68
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:43,232
Liberal veterans hierarchy

69
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:45,536
Most of it

70
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:48,096
You can imagine what he's doing they're doing a little

71
00:03:54,240 --> 00:04:00,384
Next episode

72
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,152
Go to be about

73
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:08,320
Really hard couple time travel episodes we're going to end up doing

74
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:11,648
Okay in the near future I want to do one of my

75
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,464
The day of the Boston bomb

76
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:21,887
Cuz I was really curious cuz I remember listening to him a little bit back then

77
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:26,751
Here's the thing I don't know Forever cover the episode itself because

78
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:28,031
Much like the 9/11

79
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,823
Episode it's really not that interests

80
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,615
Okay but

81
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,199
The news of the Boston bombing is breaking

82
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:38,015
He's in the middle of an interview with Richard Belzer

83
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:39,807
Richard Belzer

84
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:42,623
The Richard Belzer sidecars

85
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,159
His coverage of the Busta

86
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,695
Over Skype

87
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:46,719
It's amazing

88
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:50,815
So he is still on Skype with Richard Belzer

89
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,351
Well this news break

90
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:54,399
And Richard Belzer is not allowed to go

91
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,703
No and he's thrilled to be there

92
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:01,311
Wildly

93
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,335
Target Patriots

94
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:08,735
Belzer's just straight-up signing off on Olive and Order and everything

95
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:14,623
You think he's like you know he has a lot of ideas about JFK but

96
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:20,511
Richard Belzer Bells Hells Bells

97
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:21,791
And he's just there

98
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:25,631
I told Richard Belzer

99
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:28,447
So it's digging around as trying to find a

100
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,263
Something for us to cover because like I said

101
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:33,823
No man's land

102
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,871
Where was no good

103
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,663
I was really struggling

104
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,431
And then

105
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:40,223
I realize realize

106
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,247
On Monday

107
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,551
Alex Jones didn't interview with Jack

108
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,319
Dystopian

109
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:46,367
Yes we brought him up a couple times and

110
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,159
And today

111
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,439
It is finally time

112
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,719
For us to do

113
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:51,999
Do something

114
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:54,303
Call one of our 30 days

115
00:05:57,119 --> 00:06:00,703
Are going to become more and more essential

116
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,471
That week

117
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:04,543
Clearly delineate these f****** characters are

118
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,591
Exist in the periphery

119
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:09,407
Okay Alex Jones interview with

120
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:11,711
Because

121
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:13,503
He is one of the main forces

122
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,783
Is behind the neck Ron Lee

123
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:18,367
So I found a

124
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,647
A New Yorker article

125
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:20,927

128
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,815
Okay Yorker story

129
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,607

130
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:29,375
Uses

131
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,399
An interview with Jack

132
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,423
Sobiech

133
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:32,703
It sort of foundation

134
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,263
From this New Yorker

135
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:38,591
I reach pasovic by phone on Saturday

136
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:41,663

Is Miami to attend a party hosted by the far-right

138
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:45,503
Self-promoter

139
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,527
Milo yiannopoulos

140
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:50,367
Asobi expect much of Friday night monitoring for Chancellor

141
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,135
Pole

142
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,159
Before 10 message

143
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:54,975
Which has recently become a breeding ground

144
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:56,255
Four nationalist trolls

145
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,791
Both in the US and abroad

146
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,327
There's a quote from Passover

147
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:03,423
People were claiming something big was coming so I just kept hitting refresh you told

148
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,471
Shortly before 3 p.m.

149
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,239
3 p.m.

150
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:10,079
4chan user posted 9 GB of information

And internal documents

153
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,199
From the campaign of Emmanuel macron

154
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:19,039
Bia could not know whether all the information was authentic

155
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,575
He didn't even have time to glam

156
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,367
Through most of the thousands of pages

157
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:26,207
But he considered his journalistic duty to let his followers know about the leak

158
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:26,975
Quote

159

Along with the hashtag bicron week

163
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,471
Got involved

164
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,263
According to him

165
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:42,591
It was

166
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,895
And that's why everybody was mad at

167
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:45,919
Wikileaks or something

168
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,967
And yet they weren't the ones who

169
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,759
Leaked the information to wear hats

170
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,039
They just had it

171
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:53,343
Yeah they really got with it and really stiff

172
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,159
Hacked by somebody

173
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:58,207
He goes to this party

174
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,999
And people start retweeting it

175
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,023
And it starts

176
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,047
The catch Steam

177
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,911
So like at about midnight

178
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,703
He realizes

179
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,239

She called a quote

188
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,999
The first few minutes consisted of

189
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,791
He has not read or looked

190
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,583
He's going to a party at the

193
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:46,335
Wapa sobiech occasionally made the okay hand gesture all right

194
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,663
Just f******

195
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,711
Just let me enjoy that

196
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:53,247
Yeah sure that

197
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:56,319
Mental image of monsters

198
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,623
Journalism bulshit

199
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,647
Yeah

200
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,183
You're dancing to Migos

201
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:08,351
He took some harsh criticism and his response was

202
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:11,423
I just find interesting things and post them to my Twitter feed

203
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:17,311
Look journalists have gotten so bad that they see someone like me doing real work actually digging through documents

204
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:20,383
And distributing them to people they assume there must be some sort of

205
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,407
Conspiracy behind it

206
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:25,503
Anything this could be a learning experience for the New York Times and lamon

207
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,271
And the rest

208
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:29,087
Understand how real journalism words

209
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:35,487
He would do his own admission in this article

210
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:42,399
So that should give you some food

211
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,423
F*** that guy is

212
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,703
Yeah I'm not right

213
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:48,287
Hate him I read I read something about him

214
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,055
Describe

215
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:50,847
Journalism

216
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:55,455
Garrett

217
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,247
And I believe his quote was

218
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:02,111
I'll go to a trump rally and start spinning anti-clinton stuff

219
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:10,815
Such a dick that's not being a journalist of any kind of directly relate

220
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,863
To what we talked about in the 2050

221
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:13,631
Peanut

222
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,679
Where Mark Dice went out

223
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:20,799
And ask people to be supported

224
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,639
In Fort Worth without a video about it

225
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:26,431
Drudge Report

226
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:28,991
Alex Jones starts reporting The Drudge Report

227
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:29,759
Is reporting

228
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:30,527
This thing

229
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,551
ABS cycle

230
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,319
Yeah

231
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:34,879
Itsnotjakefuller sobiech goes and starts a fight

232
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,183
Anti-trump rally

233
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:39,743
He becomes the story many reports on the story

234
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,303
Yvette

235
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,583
Okay

236
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,887
Now I have only taken

237
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:46,911
0

238
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:47,679
Journalism

239
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,239
But

240
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,775
I have read

241
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:53,823
Journalism

242
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:54,591
Temperature

243
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:57,151
I feel like that's wrong

244
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:04,063
Aren't you supposed to like by the definition of Journal aren't you supposed to record these things

245
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,087
NFL

246
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:11,487
Even

247
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:19,679
We're going to talk quite a bit about the Soviet today

248
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,471
At the end

249
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,263
I guarantee you

250
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,287
He going to be bought

251
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:25,567
But

252
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:26,591
We have to start

253
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:29,151
With why he was on the show on Monday

254
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:32,223
So he was tweeting about the macron wife

255
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:36,319
Right and now he's coming on to Infowars on Monday

256
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,343
Because

257
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,623
The Narrative is

258
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,159
Is that macron himself

259
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,951
Is suing Jack Purcell

260
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:47,327
So I will let I will let Alex Jones start the narrative

261
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:54,495
The Shelby actor

262
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:57,055
The whistleblowers the Lakes

263
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,871
I don't know if he's doing

264
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:03,967
He's doing is they're starting an investigation into

265
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:06,783
They are

266
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:07,551
Simply legal

267
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,623
To investigate

268
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,391
Leasehackr

269
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,671
The one

270
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:14,207
You got hacked illegal

271
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,999
Especially because

272
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,279
This hack is different

273
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,815
Then the podesta

274
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:19,583
Another hacks in

275
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,119
In the past

276
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,655
Flippantly

277
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:23,935
Has tons of pictures

278
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:27,519
Apparently macron put his own fiction

279
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,543
Mark

280
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,871
Super smart

281
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:34,687
Didn't know he was going to be hacked

282
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,479
Still

283
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:39,551
I mean if you're half you know you're going to

284
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:42,623
Intelligence agencies in the last

285
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,671
Today's have confirmed that they told

286
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,975
Guys

287
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:51,071
We can monitor them we're seeing them happening

288
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,607
You are being

289
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:54,399
Digitally attack

290
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,423
So

291
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:57,983
You should guess

292
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:01,055
Like if you're going up against the Nationals candidate

293
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,335
Anywhere

294
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:04,127
You better believe you're gonna get high

295
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,943
Just do a better job of hiding

296
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:10,783
It's becoming the tool of the present and the future of life

297
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:14,367
This one is undeniable

298
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,647
Like this was

299
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,183
With Italy

300
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,719
We're trying to influence

301
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:21,023
The selection there were sirens

302
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:23,839
And the only reason is to help the national

303
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:28,959
The other hack

304
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:30,751
Helping Nationals candidate

305
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:31,775
With title

306
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,823
To Putin

307
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,687
Yeah it is

308
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,735
It is now on

309
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,783
Evidence

310
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:45,855
Coincidence I will kill mice

311
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,927
It's like it's like this stuff happening

312
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:51,231
Sally gate at Valley gate

313
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:53,279
Clapper's testimony the other day

314
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,815
Call me being fired

315
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:58,143
Today ever recording this

316
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,447
All of it is cheap

317
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:02,751
Too much I don't know how to handle this

318
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:05,567
Let's not talk about that let's talk about Jack put Soviet

319
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:08,895
It's easier some person who deserves to be

320
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:13,759
He's going to talk about

321
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:16,831
Stuff that's being found in these documents

322
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:21,951
I hope it's pink what really happened what's unfolding why they're suing you either so upsetting

323
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:27,839
Escorts the drugs and what's going on

324
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:32,447
Try Channel

325
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:53,183
Funding antifa

326
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,719
Let's be clear

327
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:55,999
There is not

328
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:56,767
311

329
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:57,791
Of those Bank

330
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:58,815
But he's talking about

331
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:05,471
There is absolutely no evidence of it because it's been proven they do not exist

332
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:07,007
Images

333
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:11,359
Are all not what they say they are insurance

334
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,783
During the pain for defamation because that

335
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:22,879
Literally what she's doing

336
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:30,815
Not noticed he's not a French I don't know

337
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:31,583
But they're not

338
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,375
Here's the thing

339
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,143
Will probably

340
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:36,447
The kind of behavior that's being expressed

341
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,983
Pierre is the kind of thing

342
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:44,639
Sure hope they do now because now he's he's introducing this idea of like

343
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:46,943
They were paying people to secops

344
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,223
And then it's going to get worse

345
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,503
May 1st

346
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:57,695

Sexual cult

00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:17,151
She was involved in pedophilia himself

350
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:28,159

Search for mmc3

354
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,815
Everything that comes up

355
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:35,839
Is about an inn

356
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,375
Nintendo controller

357
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:40,191
Kobe memory-management controller

358
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,287
This is that

359
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:49,407
Deep stuff

360
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:52,991
I mean his wife is a lot older than him

361
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,551
The age of consent

362

Francis

363
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,111
So

364
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:02,719
I don't know I don't know if you want to call that pedophilia but like actually

365
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:07,071
Yeah specifically about

366
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,935
Child abuse

Unfounded

368
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:15,775
It's just weird

369
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:22,175
Who was his high school

370
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:24,479
Relationship

371
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:27,807
Weird and unusual and

372
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:32,927
I know at least two people who ended up dating teachers one of them got married but they did not

373
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:34,207
Start their

374
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,487
While they were

375
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:36,255
Peter and Stewie

Bangarang

382
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:56,223
But I also am not here to call it pedophilia

383
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,759
I think that that is

384
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,295
Be great if you explicit

385
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:01,087
Like at the very beginning of the

386
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,111
The episode you like

387
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:10,303
Personal investment of this whatsoever

388
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:12,351
Yeah

389
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:15,167
I do think it matters though culturally that the

390
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:17,215
Is 15

391
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:19,519
It's not illegal

392
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,711
Gross and you should be held

393
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:31,807
Anyway I Eagles on UE says even worse stuff

394
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:32,831
About

395
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:33,855
Macron and his wife

396
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:37,183
But even then it's he made it implies it

397
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,207
He wasn't

398
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:40,511
That he was involved in Petal

399
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:42,815
It was like he was in

400
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,351
The victim of pedophilia

401
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:47,423
All around

402
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,263
It was part of that world and therefore he will always be part of that work

403
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:57,151
A complete skipped over the part where he said that he's on a gay sex

404
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,175
Colt email

405
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:04,319
Is totally believable

406
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:10,207
Email is what kind of gay sex called as an email that's a shity called

407
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:13,791
It's time to send email blast for a next game

408
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,607
Hey guys I'm going to

409
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:17,631
Send you an Evite

410
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:19,679
How's Saturday morning around 11

411
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:24,543
He goes on a little more and this is the stuff that I've actually seen

412
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,823
People tweeting about

413
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,615
Like this this part of this comment

414
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:37,087
Haven't had enough

415
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:40,927
Things to translate

416
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:47,071
Hopefully people

417
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,095
Handle ever

418
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:49,631
Truth based investigation

419
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:53,215
Secondarily brought up Rebel very important

420
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:55,263
A piece of this puzzle that is going

421
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:57,055
Going to be increasingly dangerous

422
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:57,823
Future

423
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:04,479
Designer drugs

424
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:11,903
Doubt the story is Amy's admitted with him and his older wife that there's a lot of weird stuff going on

425
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:25,727
High school students

426
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:31,871
Relationship

427
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:36,479
Something is going on

428
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:45,695
And they found this guy very very young and they were using that too

429
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:59,519
Controlling president

430
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:01,823
Around the world

431
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:03,359
Great journalism

432
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:05,407
Mind control

433
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:06,943
Hooray

434
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:09,503
Yes all of them

435
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:10,271
Celebrities

436
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:11,039
Yep

437
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:13,087
Therapy whatever Kim Kardashian

438
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:18,464
Yep he's groomed

439
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:24,096
Because he said that nothing started until he was of legal age

440
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:27,424
Sister's going on

441
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,448
Sure

442
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:29,984
If somebody asked

443
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,288
Do that question all the time and then you answer

444
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,056
Truthfully

445
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:36,896
And then of course

446
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:44,320
Mind control with the designer drug right yeah they take this really young guy and you drug him up real good now he's

447
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:47,392
Your puppet

448
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,416
Now he's the youngest

449
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:52,256
President France ever literally

450
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:57,120
Someone who just beat the

451
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,656
Ants off of Maria Lopez

452
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:02,752
Crazy like

453
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:04,032
The idea

454
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:05,312
What the age of

455
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:06,336
Consensus in France

456
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:09,152
That means he's not doing any work

457
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:12,224
Just Milo's party

458
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:17,600
Mancino's really good at all

459
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:21,696
Right and then he comes into the hours Jerry's like

460
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:22,720
He's probably being

461
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:23,488
Drugged up

462
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:24,256
It is just a puppet

463
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:25,536
Like you

464
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:26,816
If your turtle toucan

465
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:27,584
Gypsy that

466
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:34,240
You don't have anything to back that all wildly about mind-control drugs and whether or not they are being used to

467
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:35,264
Populate the leader

468
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,312
As well as music

469
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:41,920
For phone

470
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:44,480
The number one musician being mine

471
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:45,248
Uncontrolled right now

472
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:48,064
Migos

473
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:52,416
This data most of the substance

474
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,952
What are you talkin about

475
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:59,072
He also is asked at one point about how he found out he's being sued

476
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:00,352
And his f****** answer is

477
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:02,912
Solveig nonsensical

478
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:07,776
Like I tried to Google it I tried to find like

479
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,056
You know

480
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:10,336
The Soviet being

481
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,360
Sued by macron

482
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:12,640
There's nothing

483
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:14,432
He said the documents Republic

484
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:15,200
But there is nothing

485
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:15,968
There's nothing

486
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:16,992
He's not being sued by

487
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,272
Anyway

488
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:20,832
We're going to get back to Jack the sobiech in a second

489
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:22,624
But I want to get the taste out of our mouths

490
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:23,904
With our old friend out

491
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:26,208
Do we need some Alex Jones on this

492
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,768
Yes we do is going to be a lot of

493
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:29,536
So let's

494
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:31,328
Joy Alex while we can

495
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,632
Discussing how evolve

496
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:36,192
What you want

497
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,008
Is Beto

498
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,800
When macron

499
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:43,104
Pyramid you came out in front of the

500
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,176
The pyramid

501
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:46,944
Satanist

502
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:47,712
Gesture

503
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:48,480
Now

504
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:50,784
Some might argue it's one of the biggest landmarks

505
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:53,600
But

506
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:56,160
Alex brings up

507
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:57,440
I need

508
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,720
I need you to let

509
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:00,768
Like I want you to hear every word of this

510
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:03,840
Alex Jones

511
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:06,656
Because he starts reading for once in his life

512
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:10,752
So here we go

513
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:12,544
And sure enough

514
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,592
Obscura

515
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:15,872
Duluth

516
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,176
And you can read where

517
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:42,496
Impairment Rays totenberg cats following the publication of an official brochure

518
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:45,056
It was claimed

519
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:53,248
They figure it wasn't quickly quoted on Denver's his diapers and became a widespread

520
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:56,832
Do they have

521
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,464
The gnosis that blue pyramid 666 painted in fact

522
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,024
False

523
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:10,912
Himself

524
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:16,544
Why is there at the end he tried to undersell how what he was reading

525
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,616
Says the opposite of what he wanted to say

526
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:23,968
You think that like these 666 tile thing it was

527
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:25,504
Sigelei proven to be a hoax

528
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,528
And he

529
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:28,064
Drops off the word hoax

530
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:30,112
Andrew

531
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:38,560
Getaround

532
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:47,008
Babe's on the beach Brock Lesnar

533
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:47,776
Because the loop

534
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:48,800
Came out

535
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:53,152
Right and all of this stuff is

536
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:54,432
Just based I mean if you listen

537
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:56,224
All just based on

538
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:57,504
Looking around you

539
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,648
Airbrush

540
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:09,536

00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:20,544
So

545
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,568
Technophobia

546
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:22,336
Just come in here

547

00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,224
A little trip

Okay baby the last time

555
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,904
What is the most important

556
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,208
Is when

557
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:40,768
Was breaking the story about pizza

558
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:43,584
So what we're going

559
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,936
Is f****** monstrosity

560
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:50,752
Story that's still

561
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:51,520
Goddamn

562
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,824
Died because

563
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:55,872
No one else should have to

564
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:58,176
Watch the entire video

565
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:59,712

Now we're going to work video

568
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:13,536
What we're going to do

569
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:14,560
Is work going to listen

570
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:17,376
Do his interview with Owen Shroyer on Infowars

571
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:20,960
And then whenever he says something about what he did

572
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:21,984
Comet Ping Pong

575
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:41,440
So like

576
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:43,744
Does serve a purpose

577
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:47,584
I like company

578
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:55,520
This is the beginning of the interview we did with Owen Shroyer

579
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:57,824
Totally

580
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:03,456
We are joined by Jack Purcell

581
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:09,856
He was giving me great until on Election night ended up coming inside of

582
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:11,648
Comet Pizza and ping pong

583
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:16,512
So we should just stop there for a second and really make clear that he is

584
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:17,536
Is not a journalist

585
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:18,304
The functionary

586
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,376
Yes he is a political off

587
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:23,680
Never been

588
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:25,984
Journalism

589
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,592
Yeah you know how Fox News

590
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:31,360
Basically it already

591
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:33,152
Not too sure

592
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:39,552
Anyway biggest Trends on Twitter has been the whole piece

593
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:42,880
There's a lot of weird activity going on here

594
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:52,864
Yahoo actually went to Comet Ping Pong

595
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,168
On the ground temporarily

596
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:06,176
Research

597
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:18,720
Just towards the end of the campaign as Citizens for Trump we're working very hard to get

598
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:25,376
So I haven't really paid much attention to it

599
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:27,936
So he is already laid out

600
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:29,728
Gear his groundwork he was

601
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:31,776
Actively working

602
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:33,312
To get a particular candidate

603
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:35,616
Like a journalist

604
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:36,640
What's this

605
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:38,944
Controversy

606
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:39,968
It's sprung out of

607
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,248
The illegal leaks

608
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:43,552
The opposite

609
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:48,160
Gmail

610
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:52,000
Brett journalist and really didn't really pay much attention to

611
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:58,400
There's also not true

612
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:03,264
He goes on

613
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,800
They

614
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:05,824
In this next clip

615
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:06,848
Discusses

616
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,384
A little bit about

617
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:09,408
Decision

618
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,432
To go

619
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,528
City have in it

620
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:16,064
Inner battle

621
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,344
Who's a hero story

622
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:21,696
Okay

623
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:27,584
Hero's journey concert Tampa.

624
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,608
Can I pull the sword

625
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:31,168
He doesn't know

626
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:50,112
Sit down

627
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:51,136
Order dinner

628
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:53,696
And see what happens

629
00:30:54,464 --> 00:31:00,352
Kind of a strange reaction

630
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:05,472
I mean humans have a 6S there's a reason why certain environment make

631
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:09,568
Hair stand up on the back of our necks there's a reason why we get butterflies I feel

632
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:19,552
You would kind of sent it you sent the weirdness of the place

633
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:22,880
When you walked in and then

634
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:24,928
No I can feel some

635
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:28,000
It just got a little bit colder

636
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:29,536
That game is not your journey

637
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:32,096
Can feel pedophile

638
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:34,656
Energy

639
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:39,264
Pizzagate

00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:41,824
I remember

641
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,872
Amber

642
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:48,480
Walter Cronkite would get on TV

643
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:52,064

00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,856

00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:15,616
Prosecute a lot of people illegally for actually have

We're going to be the next victim

00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:30,880
There they might be high

Inside,

678
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:44,192

679
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:47,776
With us

680
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:49,056

00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:37,696
Ono Ono

690
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:44,096
American Pawn or not

691
00:34:57,152 --> 00:35:03,296
Are the sickness into the back now

692
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:16,864
Play more sleepy

693
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,680
In history and

694
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:21,984
He does one of the first things that tip

695
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,800
Them off I'm certain that he's not on the level

696
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:30,944
And that is narrating their walking us to the back

697
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:35,808
Spigen walking into a flower he has his dances periscoping

698
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:42,208
Phone in his shirt pocket walking around with it

699
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:43,232
Nothing creepy

700
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:44,768
Tons of families

701
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:46,560
Signs of people eating dinner

702
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:47,584
It's a cool looking

703
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,120
Being like restaurant bar

704
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:51,168
There's nothing

705
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:54,240
He claims that like all we got footage of all these

706
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:55,776
Creepy pictures

707
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:57,056
Nothing anyway

708
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:58,336

The first dance

712
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:06,784
Pictures of him

713
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,832
Incredibly mischaracterizing

714
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:16,000
I am human

715
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:17,024
Mario Pizza

716
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:24,960
I would like to

717
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:27,264
So he goes on in his interview

718
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,544
With our man

719
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,080
Owen Shroyer

720
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:33,408
To talk a little bit about the various games that they have

721
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:45,952
We are going into the back room

722
00:36:54,656 --> 00:37:00,288
In the Navy end

723
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:15,136
So here

724
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:17,440
You spend the goalie

725
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:18,208
3 *

726
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:21,536
So that's

727
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:23,328
Characterization

728
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:25,376
What happened with the foosball

729
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:28,192
Now I have the all the audio of that

730
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:29,984
Here is what happened with the foosball

731
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,544
I know I don't know

732
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,080
I don't know

733
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:35,104
It's crazy

734
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,664
Close attention to the end of it

735
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,968
Cuz the lady very clearly explained

736
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,760
Why she was a little bit

737
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:43,552
Anime

738
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:51,488
Is it foosball to do we have to

739
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:57,888
Footballguys

740
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:07,872
Football football

741
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,648
So you got that there

742
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:23,488
I don't know

743
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:30,656
I don't know

744
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:34,240
Server but at the same time she doesn't know

745
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:36,288
And her reason for not knowing is she

746
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:37,312
He just started

747
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:38,336
I don't know

748
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:39,616
Suspicious if you don't know what

749
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:41,664
I don't think it is

750
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:43,712
You guys got bumper pool

751
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:47,040
You guys are pretty.

752
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:49,856
Again Emco

753
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:51,392
Wheatley taking out contacts

754
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:52,416
What happened

755
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:53,952
But the Foosball fun

756
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:54,720
It's not done

757
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:56,768
We have two more clips about foosball

758
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:57,536

00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:59,584
Because be this much about

760
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:02,400
Because it really illustrates how weird

761
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:05,216
Like he's not acting like a normal customer

762
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:06,752
Listen to this

763
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:12,896
Pacing and leading

764
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:18,784
Do you say that out loud

765
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:21,600
Basically

766
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:26,720
We're just normal guys who want to play foosball

767
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:28,768
Looks like an idiot

768
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:30,816
Go to work

769
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:33,632
Eventually the person

770
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:35,680
Resume

771
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:36,448
Doppler radar

772
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,984
In the video

773
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,776
But someone comes over and bring him

774
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:40,544
Ball

775
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,568
And it also has berries

776
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:44,640
Suspicious

777
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:50,528
I thought you said he was just normal things

778
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:07,680
So that's how you know

779
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:09,984
Immediately is not interested

780
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:13,312
Foosball wants the ball shows up

781
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:15,872
I see you've come

782
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:16,896
Confirmed my suspicions

783
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:19,968
Okay great

784
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,784
Case proven

785
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:26,112
So he goes on

786
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:28,160
Centerview

787
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:29,440
See what else he's got with him

788
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:38,144
9

789
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:41,216
Is hurting people going back and forth

790
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:46,592
Oh no no no

791
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:01,440
Door opens

792
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:07,840
Play Sam I in right now and unique

793
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:10,912
Bathroom door

794
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:15,264
Evil says that there's like a backroom

795
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,592
No no no come over here to use the bathroom

796
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:21,408
That's where the f****** bathroom is

797
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:23,456
Right but he also

798
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:26,528
Come over here to behind the bar

799
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:27,808
To use the bathroom

800
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:28,576
We have a

801
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:31,904
Before that he was saying if there's kids

802
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,184
Stanford

803
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,000
This curtained area and zip

804
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:37,024
In the area

805
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,304
It's not in

806
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,584
This is

807
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:41,888
There is a backroom

808
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,680
There is because every

809
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:45,216
F****** business as a backroom

810
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:49,312
Every single one there's a kitchen there might be

811
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:52,128
So what's your cleaning supplies

812
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:55,711
What's fun about what you see in the Periscope is that he shows the back

813
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:56,479
Door

814
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:59,039
The ventricles of the backroom Minis

815
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:01,087
Stafford

816
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:04,671
Don't say anything you can't really see if it's too far away

817
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:07,999
There are not kids scampering around

818
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:10,303
Why

819
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:11,327
Creepiness of it

820
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:12,607
But there's also

821
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:16,447
No one back there playing ping pong

822
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:17,727
It's all empty

823
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:19,775
No one tells him not to go back there

824
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:20,799
Thursday

825
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:26,175
The end of the last Clipper blade

826
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:26,943
Here's the bathroom

827
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:30,015
Underground brother a little creepy

828
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:33,087
Got a little creepy

829
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:39,487
Adore cool bar

830
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:41,791
Of course you'd want to have something

831
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:43,583
Interesting and unique in your bar

832
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:46,399
So beat goes on to

833
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:48,959
To tell the the rest

834
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:50,495
Little bit more of his

835
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:53,055
To Owen Shroyer

836
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:56,383
His time

837
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:13,023
Narrated for you

838
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:19,423
To Washington d.c.

839
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:23,007
And says you need to leave The Establishment I am denying you service

840
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:25,567
So before we get any further

841
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:26,335
I want

842
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:27,615
To play this

843
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:29,407
I think it's important

844
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:30,175
This

845
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:31,199
Confirm

846
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:33,247
Projector sobiech did in fact order at

847
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:40,159
The hottie with the pepperoni and jalapeno

848
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:45,023
So he did

849
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:48,607
Thank you

850
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:52,447
As far as I can tell everything else is alive

851
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:55,263
Did order I got

852
00:43:56,031 --> 00:44:00,383
I like to be more fair than not fair and in this case

853
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:02,431
Brightright on

854
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:04,223
Right on with that order

855
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:07,295
So he tells the story when he's on

856
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:08,063
I think that

857
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:09,343
I mean

858
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:10,879
Obvious

859
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:13,695
He ordered the garlic

860
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:15,999
He's part of

861
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:19,583
Code

862
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:20,863
Absolutely

863
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:21,887
Garlic Knot

864
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:26,751
Thinking at this point like what do you think

865
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:27,519
You heard

866
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:28,287
You heard

867
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:30,079
Describe what

868
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:31,615
What's the story

869
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:37,759
Well we do know that he

870
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:40,063
That's true

871
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:41,855
Have to give him the benefit of the doubt

872
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:42,623
Yeah

873
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:44,159
Bob Barker

874
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:45,439
Give me $1

875
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:46,975
So

876
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:49,279
Is sitting at a table with his friend

877
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:51,071
And he start you started

878
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:53,375
He's starting to crack under the Spy pressure

879
00:44:53,887 --> 00:45:00,031
He's on the phone

880
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:06,431
The guy was talking to you before

881
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:12,831
Tobacco please

882
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:36,639
Bulshit little child

883
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:38,943
It's a good one

884
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:39,967
This is it

885
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:43,039
It's actually in the army

886
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:43,807
Yeah

887
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:45,343
Apparently

888
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:47,647
Apparently our armies

889
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:54,047
I am not a confident of every type of support this really f***** up is like these kind of

890
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:54,815
Louis beastars

891
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:56,607
I have been incredibly effect

892
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:58,399
In terms of making him a celebrity

893
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:03,519
Important

894
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:04,799
In the alt right

895
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:08,127
He is a prominent figure in alt-right Media

896
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:15,551
Women

897
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:21,951
Already 14in right now or not at a pizza place freaking out that we've been burned

898
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:23,487
Okay that's true

899
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:27,583
We have not been burned yet

900
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:28,863
Jackie

901
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,143
Decided that he's burnt

902
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:37,055
You know I love I love that he's like we've been burned and then immediately

903
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:42,431
Normal order psycho

904
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:46,783
Shall we only have Pepsi

905
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:50,879
She probably heard him say we've been burned

906
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:53,439
At this point they've already behaved

907
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:54,719
Super weird

908
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:55,487
Misplace

909
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:57,279
Like to the point where I used to manage a movie

910
00:46:58,047 --> 00:47:00,095
If someone was acting like this in my theater

911
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:00,863
I would

912
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,399
Either ignore them

913
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:03,935
Or I would throw them the f***

914
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:06,239
Yeah it depends on the circle

915
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:07,775
From stances

916
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:09,823
Let's say in a movie theater that was

917
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:11,103
Center of

918
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:12,639
Spurious roofers

919
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:14,687
Satanic

920
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:16,223
Pedophilic murder

921
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:22,367
Periscope and narrating

922
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:25,183
Yeah I picked at the reasonable thing to do

923
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:28,511
More obviously have negative intent than if they were like

924
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:30,303
Two kids

925
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:32,351
Standing on top of each other

926
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:35,423
Fake 2-Step

927
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:39,007
Decided decided I don't know what is

928
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:40,031
Friends

929
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:41,055
Call Mater

930
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:41,823
He's been burned

931
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:50,527
By of nothing

932
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:51,295
I got that out

933
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:57,183
The manager and two DC cops

934
00:47:57,695 --> 00:48:02,303
Say I am denying you service

935
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:22,015
No thank you

936
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:37,887
So this is getting an in-depth Pizza recommendation after we've been burned with a barn

937
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:42,239
The guy comes over there the waiter comes over and he's like even goats

938
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:43,775
My favorite use of spinach

939
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:45,311
Yeah really popular pizza

940
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:50,431
Yeah it's really not my favorite Yusuf

941
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:53,759
I want a special report

942
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:56,575
Favorite uses

943
00:48:57,087 --> 00:48:58,111
That's the waiters

944
00:48:58,623 --> 00:49:02,975
Is discussing the pizza that's very popular

945
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:05,535
Anyway

946
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:06,815
The waiters

947
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:08,095
Doing his job

948
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:10,655
Is being very friendly and helpful

949
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:13,471
There's a lot of

950
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:14,751
Is that like

951
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:16,287
Really in-depth

Alright that's 10 evil

955
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:26,527
So far

00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:33,695
Yeah

957
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:34,719
Breathe

958
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:38,815
Ben

959
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:39,583
Shown

960

If you go look through jacket so big

962
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:45,983
Interested Russia

963
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:50,591
Seems to have a lot of interest in reporting Russian Embassy news

964
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:52,383
There's been a number of times

965
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:53,663
That's because

966
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:55,199
Recorded things

967
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:56,735
Things that are not very important

968
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:58,015
Russian Embassy

969
00:49:58,783 --> 00:50:01,343
He has reported from

970
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:02,367
They're just

971
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:04,671
I'm not saying everything

972
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:05,951
I'm just saying

973
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:08,767
I do know what you say

974
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:09,791
It's weird

975
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:11,839
And if you want to get worse vibes

976
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:12,863
Here

977
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:13,887

Haven't been kicked out yet

979
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:16,447
Human friends get a drink

980
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:17,727
And this is how they cheers

981
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:30,783
Unusual

982
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:36,159
I've said it

983
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:41,279

984
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:43,583

00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:44,607
It's not it's

986
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:49,215
Nothing in this whole thing is it's nothing but in the context

987
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:50,239
It's interesting

988
00:50:56,383 --> 00:51:02,271
Chase Bank

989
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:05,087
Yeah I agree with that

990
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:11,487
But I leave it in really more to illustrate the fact that

991
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:14,559
Pizza recommendation

992
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:16,095
They've ordered a garlic knife

993
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:20,959
They've all gotten drink and are choosing each other having a drink

994
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:24,543
And they're also I should say

995
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:25,567
He's picking up the

996
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:26,847
The camera and like

997
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:28,127
Moving it around

998
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:28,895
Clearly brought

999
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:32,479
Anybody who was watching him would know what he

1000
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:36,063
He's doing he's not being discreet the camera is out of his pocket

1001
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:38,367
If either sitting on the table with a light

1002
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:40,927
So he can be seen

1003
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:45,023
Darken, on him

1004
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:46,047
It's

1005
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:47,327
So then

1006
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:49,119
Here he is turned off

1007
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:50,655
The

1009
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:52,703
Totally

00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:54,239
Please turn off the recording

1011
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:55,775
And then it comes back on

1012
00:51:56,287 --> 00:51:56,799
With that

1013
00:51:57,311 --> 00:51:59,359
It starts up really quick so pay attention

1014
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:01,663
I turned it off

1015
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:06,527
Understand

1016
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:12,927
But considering that I myself and my staff receive death threats

1017
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:19,327
Not anything I can't control what somebody post

1018
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:25,727

I mean I want to take them out

1027
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:44,831

1028
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:51,743
Thrown out the manager

1029
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:52,767
Me and my staff

1031
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:55,583

Play Denver

1033
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:06,591
But that's what the manager comes back with his

1034
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:09,407
Are you reading the things that people are saying online

1035
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:12,991
You're feeding into it

1036
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:16,575
And your childish game of

1037
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:23,743
The members not having any of that b******* because you are

1038
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:27,583

He gets kicked out and his buddy go out in the sky

1042
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:36,543
I cut all this s*** out.

1043
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:37,311
Cuz it's all just like

1044
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:39,103
Oh my God

1045
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:46,015
At this point

1046
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:47,295
It's clear

1047
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:48,319
More f***** up

1048
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:49,599
Then he was

1049
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:51,647
Yeah like I don't

1050
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:54,207
I don't know what was going on but

1051
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:54,975
Some sort of substance

1052
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:55,999
I think it was probably

1053
00:54:57,791 --> 00:54:58,303
But anyway

1054
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:00,095
We've never heard

1055
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:02,655

1056
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:06,239
Yeah the entirety of his time in common

1057
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:08,799
Talk to himself

1058
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:10,591
And narrate his time there

1059
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:12,127
We've heard him make a big

1060
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:15,711
Deal out of the Foosball table and then wrecked someone brings him the ball

1061
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:17,247
Completely

1062
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:18,783
We've Illustrated

1064
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:23,391
Filming around the place

1065
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:25,439
While he waits for food

1066
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:26,463
He's giving a Russian

1067
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:28,255
Here's what you don't think it's a big deal but I'm going to

1068
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:30,047
Hang my hat on

1069
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:33,119
Interview with

Absolutely

1072
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:51,807
Streaming from inside here

1073
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:52,831
He didn't

1074
00:55:56,927 --> 00:56:00,767
Aggravating

1075
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:03,583
Yeah.

1076
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:05,631
Dinner at Thomas Pizza

1077
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:09,983
I didn't say you know.

1078
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:11,775
Pizza

1079
00:56:13,823 --> 00:56:17,663
Lots of people take pictures and put it on Snapchat Instagram that sorta thing

1080
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:24,063
And there's a lot of people around me with smartphones but for some reason

1081
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:35,071
What type of weird pictures

1082
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:39,167
Up just final question on your experience there before I move on to the next topic

1083
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:41,471
Did you see any of that weird artwork

1084
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:53,247
You see this weird sort of demonic artwork on the van just to the inside of the front door

1085
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:06,303
Cross between a zombie

1086
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:13,215
Recently

1087
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:19,615
So there's a possibility they may have actually taken some of those

1088
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:20,639
What

1089
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:27,039
Pizzagate it has been trending on Twitter certainly some weird stuff there we'll see if that Trend continued

1090
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:32,671
The weirdness that are reporting on and breaking on social media

1091
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:38,559
The most

1092
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:41,887
Suspicious

1093
00:57:42,143 --> 00:57:42,655
Pizzagate

1094
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:45,727
He's taking pictures down

1095
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:47,519
If

1096
00:57:47,775 --> 00:57:48,287
Picture elf

1097
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:54,687
Episode Vehicles any kind of reporter he would have looked on the ground next to where the Pixar should have been

1098
00:57:54,943 --> 00:57:58,783
Preparation of the Rapaport group portal

1099
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:01,855
#brother portal

1100
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:05,695
I remember when I was a kid right around Christmas

1101
00:58:06,975 --> 00:58:13,119
Watch out for that Rapport Elf on the Shelf right there you got to leave your wooden shoes out yet

1102
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:16,447
Like okay

1103
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:18,751
Be careful you'll get a lump

1104
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:21,823
We got nothing

1105
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:29,759
Because nothing but you does feel go on Infowars and do this interview

1106
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:32,063
In order to cast aspersions

1107
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:34,367
And insinuate all this stuff

1108
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:35,135
Truly

1109
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:35,903
F******

1110
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:36,927
Propaganda

1111
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:41,535
Surely like he's not know that they're lying

1112
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:43,583
And the fact that

1113
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:45,887
Owen charges goes along with

1114
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:47,167
Of course

1115
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:51,775
Percent know they're lying

1116
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:53,055
They don't care

1117
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:56,383
I don't think first of all I don't think Owen

1118
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:57,151
Redeem

1119
00:58:57,407 --> 00:58:58,175
The periscope

1120
00:58:58,431 --> 00:58:59,455
Is long and boring

1121
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:00,735
Adidas

1122
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:05,599
Just going along with it and like assuming the

1123
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:07,647
So big is a reliable source

1124
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:09,695
Maybe Sylvia Kenosha

1125
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:10,975
He's lying he knows

1126
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:12,255
But he lucked into

1127
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:13,791
This outright Fame

1128
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:16,607
Who gives a s***

1129
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:18,911
Reality is malleable it's like

1130
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:21,727
Milo used to always argue where to post fact

1131
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:22,495
World

1132
00:59:22,751 --> 00:59:23,519
Doesn't matter

1133
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:24,287
Yeah but that's

1134
00:59:25,055 --> 00:59:25,823
Real bad

1135
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:26,591
White

1136
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:33,759
Seems like

1137
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:34,527
Is Justin

1138
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:41,695
AMC in your narrative

1139
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:43,999
But seeing people believe your narrative

1140
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:47,071
I think there's a trolling aspect of it they would never Cop 2

1141
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:52,191
Addiction

1142
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:53,983
Because I think

1143
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:57,567
Whenever you get a like

1144
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:00,383
Quran Twitter

1145
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:01,919
Same kind of dope

1146
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:03,199
Influx

1147
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:07,039
All of this attention maybe they are just really gay

1148
01:00:07,295 --> 01:00:07,807
Getting off on

1149
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:11,135
Did yeah they're just doing whatever they can to get more

1150
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:11,903
More like sand

1151
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:12,671
To get more

1152
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:15,487
More people giving them this dope

1153
01:00:15,743 --> 01:00:20,351
Could be like a propaganda version of like this new

1154
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:21,631
Internet addiction

1155
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:22,911
We've experienced

1156
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:24,191
The possible

1157
01:00:24,447 --> 01:00:27,007
Series as good as anything

1158
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:28,543
There's no possible reason

1159
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:29,311
Send that

1160
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:30,079
Cuz I can't

1161
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:30,847
Believe it

1162
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:33,407
Denny's dark moments he knows he's a liar

1163
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:35,711
There's no doubt

1164
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:37,247
Tons of videos of him

1165
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:42,111
Like dozen

1166
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:44,927
Really give a s*** that his whole existence is kind of based on

1167
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:50,559
I don't really care he doesn't really care that he's a liar he's making money

1168
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:52,351
Washington

1169
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:55,167
The rebel media

1170
01:00:56,959 --> 01:00:57,727
I don't know if this is

1171
01:00:57,983 --> 01:01:00,543
He has White House credentials

1172
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:08,991
Okay I don't know what you have

1173
01:01:09,247 --> 01:01:09,759
Supposed to get in there

1174
01:01:10,015 --> 01:01:11,551
You could you can get day credential

1175
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:14,111
You have like

1176
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:16,159
Across-the-board credential

1177
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:17,951
Mike cernovich was there for a day

1178
01:01:24,095 --> 01:01:25,119
My point is

1179
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:27,423
But people like this we have no regard for the

1180
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:29,215
Just one

1181
01:01:29,471 --> 01:01:29,983
Insinuating

1182
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:39,967
You can't prove you don't know

1183
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:42,527
It doesn't matter he's never going to

1184
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:44,831
To GameStop

1185
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:46,623
It just makes him more

1186
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:50,463
In the White House

1187
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:53,023
He goes to the White

1188
01:01:57,631 --> 01:01:58,399
I don't not anymore

1189
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:00,703
I want to pee on some

1190
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:06,591
I do too

1191
01:02:06,847 --> 01:02:09,407
Meaningless

1192
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:13,503
The Congress if it was worth a s*** it would have already

1193
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:14,527
Everything

1194
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:17,599
Investigate all this s***

1195
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:18,367
The investigation

1196
01:02:18,623 --> 01:02:19,135
Every pop

1197
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:20,671
Possible turn

1198
01:02:20,927 --> 01:02:21,951
What is tax.

1199
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:23,231
Why won't

1200
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:25,791
I think it's actually cheaper than that

1201
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:32,191
You heard it here first

1202
01:02:32,447 --> 01:02:35,007
Bingo

1203
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:41,407
Why are balls off and that way wouldn't even f****** matter

1204
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:42,175
Yeah

1205
01:02:43,711 --> 01:02:44,479
Standard when the world is

1206
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:48,831
Because what does it benefit a man to gain the world if he loses it

1207
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:49,599
Sole Jordan

1208
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:57,279
12

1209
01:02:57,535 --> 01:03:02,911
And everyone we talked about

1210
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:04,959
Except

1211
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:06,239
Encapsulate that last

1212
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:08,031
But he had with Owen

1213
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:09,823
That last

1214
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:11,359
Legitimately

1215
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:15,199
All the stuff you like everyone was creepy there

1216
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:19,039
I saw the Periscope we heard them they were just

1217
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:19,807
Free People

1218
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:21,599
They didn't know what foosball was

1219
01:03:21,855 --> 01:03:23,903
The girls started three days ago

1220
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:26,975
I don't care that she didn't know what foosball is

1221
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:27,743
Very belief

1222
01:03:28,255 --> 01:03:30,047
That's not it that's nothing at all

1223
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:32,863
They treated you weird

1224
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:39,519
Exactly

1225
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:43,615
Asian kid scampering around behind curtains

1226
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:46,687
So

1227
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:50,783
Where we come to at the end is the only thing that is maybe defense

1228
01:03:51,807 --> 01:03:53,855
And you can't tell from the periscope

1229
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:54,879
Cuz it's shot terribly

1230
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:55,903
And it's dark

1231
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:58,719
But there's a possibility that there's weird art

1232
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:00,511
Right

1233
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:04,095
Like a lot of cool places right now I want to say first

1234
01:04:04,351 --> 01:04:04,863
Who gives a s***

1235
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:05,887
What's second

1236
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:07,679
If that's the only way

1237
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:09,727
Real thing in your argument

1238
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:11,263
You are the most

1239
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:12,287
PC fukka

1240
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:13,311
Pile of s***

1241
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:14,591
In the world

1242
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:17,663
If your argument that you can hang your hat on

1243
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:19,711
Against this pizza place

1244
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:20,735
Okay

1245
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:22,271
This weirdo okay

1246
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:27,391
Okay

1247
01:04:32,255 --> 01:04:37,887
Oh really I mean that that is really what's going on Ark

1248
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:40,191
Definition of weird art

1249
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:41,215
Satanic

1250
01:04:45,567 --> 01:04:47,871
Play Store

1251
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:49,151
Kiss with seitan

1252
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:53,759
Satanic

1253
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:57,087
Let me know

1254
01:04:57,343 --> 01:04:58,879
I feel personally

1255
01:04:59,391 --> 01:05:01,183
All you really need to know about Jackie

1256
01:05:02,463 --> 01:05:02,975
Yeah pretty much

1257
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:05,279
In the middle of the pizzagate

1258
01:05:05,791 --> 01:05:06,559
Controversy

1259
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:07,583
Quotes

1260
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:08,351
He went

1261
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:09,119
That's two,

1262
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:10,911
Pong made a very misleading

1263
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:12,703
Periscope video about it

1264
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:15,007
Parlayed it into an interview on

1265
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:15,775
Infowars

1266
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:18,079
Work he lied about it since a tional e

1267
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:20,383
In order to make it appear that

1268
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:22,943
Really creepy things happen there wasn't when they didn't

1269
01:05:23,455 --> 01:05:26,271
His own source material doesn't backup his reporting

1270
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:28,063
Either shity journalist

1271
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:29,599
Is propaganda

1272
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:31,391
Why we need to be afraid of

1273
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:36,255
Character that comes up at again

1274
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:39,583
Because because like I said he's going to come up again

1275
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:41,631
He clearly has some sort of

1276
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:42,399
Connection

1277
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:43,167
2

1278
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:44,191
The

1279
01:05:44,447 --> 01:05:45,215
The Nationalist

1280
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:49,567
Movement that's going on otherwise he would not have had pre Advanced knowledge

1281
01:05:53,663 --> 01:05:54,175
Bleach

1282
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:58,271
His own video

1283
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:03,647
Complete opposition to what it is easier

1284
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:07,231
Bother

1285
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:09,791
Did you hide your tracks

1286
01:06:10,047 --> 01:06:12,607
Why are we losing you know why

1287
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:17,983
You know why it's because it's what we keep coming back to the battle of the second step

1288
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:19,519
And they always will win

1289
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:20,799
No one looks into

1290
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:27,455
The shorter episode today

1291
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:28,735
Du-du-du price

1292
01:06:29,247 --> 01:06:30,271
Well yeah I mean

1293
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:31,295
I can't I couldn't

1294
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:32,575
I couldn't get it together

1295
01:06:33,087 --> 01:06:33,855
But will be back

1296
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:36,415
If I was going to take

1297
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:37,183
Automation

1298
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:39,999
It would be that

1299
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:41,791
There is

1300
01:06:42,047 --> 01:06:42,815
Absolutely

1301
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:45,119
Like they

1302
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:45,887
They just

1303
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:51,007
Complete and utter

1304
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:52,799
They have no they don't care who they

1305
01:06:53,823 --> 01:06:55,103
They don't care about anything but

1306
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:55,871
Themselves

1307
01:06:56,127 --> 01:06:59,199
They don't care about each other they just want to get as much as

1308
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:05,599
That's fake

1309
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:09,183
Even in that Alex Jones profile whenever they're talking about

1310
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:10,719
The interviews from other

1311
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:12,511
It's just a

1312
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:19,167
Medium to sell pimple

1313
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:20,447
Article about Alex Jones

1314
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:23,263
Talk about the service Financial

1315
01:07:24,543 --> 01:07:25,055
In his

1316
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:25,823
His business

1317
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:30,943
It's really interesting because basically they're just laying out s*** that we laid out in one of our first episode

1318
01:07:31,455 --> 01:07:34,271
We scooped the New York Magazine buy like four months

1319
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:35,807
Really interesting because

1320
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:36,831
Beer batter

1321
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:42,207
Well they aren't they on cupboard that it doesn't cost anything for people to

1322
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:43,231
Play Alex

1323
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:44,767
Does Travis pacificator show

1324
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:46,815
Like I told uncovering.

1325
01:07:48,351 --> 01:07:50,655
Your number one Alex Jones information source

1326
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:51,679
Knowledge

1327
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:55,775
We are just the real uncut

1328
01:07:57,311 --> 01:07:57,823
We should get

1329
01:07:58,079 --> 01:07:58,591
We should get energy

1330
01:07:58,847 --> 01:07:59,359
Being a lot more

1331
01:07:59,615 --> 01:08:00,127
Totally

1332
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:01,407
Hit us up New York mag

1333
