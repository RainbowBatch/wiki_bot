Fairly close to them anyways

12
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:22,944
Go there get a slice

00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:26,528

Panino's

00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:37,792
That will go nameless because I don't actually remember what the name of the place was

20
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:40,096
But there was a pizza place

21
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:43,168

00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:34,624
And that's part of the story like it's that like

39
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:41,024
Trapped in the in the Senate

40
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,304

41
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,352
I don't know if I have made this

42
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,120
Complaints

43
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:50,240
But I have one complaint about the game I don't think how fast this isn't it

44
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,800
I have not been important

45
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:59,200
Hephaestus is the reason I should be making all of these busts that you're getting like here at the he's the armorer

46
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:03,552
Glaring omission

Huge what beer

48
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,696
Anyway that was a water guy just thought when I was playing

49
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:19,424
Seems like it's a bowl of game reviews or Meredith

50
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,216
Do you know what it do you know what makes

51
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:26,848
Expedia it reminds me of old old PlayStation 1 game called as your dream

52
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,896
Okay I did was that same kind of

53
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,944
Infinite Dungeon Crawler that would

54
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,064
Populate a new dungeon for you every time but you would capture monsters

55
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,624
Is it was like a mixture of Pokemon that head

56
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:41,952
And that same kind of Hades Dungeon Crawl some fun

57
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:42,720
Fantastic

58
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,328
It was it was that weird kind of PS1 game though where is like

59
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:51,424
Also there's a dating simulator

60
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,288
Relationship system in Hades compared to that as well

61
00:03:56,544 --> 00:04:02,688
Really dating simulator got nothing

62
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:07,808

Should hear

105
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,199
Anti starts off the show as anyone would

106
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:45,503
If they had just come into work

107
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,807
YouTube driving through chaos

108
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:51,391
And I was complaining about driving to Chicago

109
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,951
This is got to be an incredible show today

110
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:54,719
Because I'm

111
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:55,743
Grown up

112
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:02,399
Grown up in people.be nose Drive

113
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,519
But I've never seen anything like that

114
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:10,335
This was road-warrior level I probably saw

115
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:15,455
100 wrecked cars in the way here smash signs glass

116
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:21,599
Firefighter trying to block major roads I wouldn't even be here if I had to just go ahead and go on around them

117
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:24,159
Because I was driving my wife's all-wheel vehicle

118
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:26,207
My favorite thing about

119
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:30,815
I need more explanation for how he went around

120
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,351
If its next line is

121
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:36,447
With an all-wheel drive vehicle get to him about that

122
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:40,543
But I do love the idea that he's starting off as Road like this better be a f***

123
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:45,919
Looking great I just threw under Road Warrior

124
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:50,783
Yeah I see you you're asking about this this car situation

125
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:52,319
Talk more about wow

126
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:54,367
And it's basically turns into a car crash

127
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:57,183
The house in my truck

128
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:59,231

00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,399
That's the only good thing that German cars good for

131
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,423
She wanted an Audi

132
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,471
And I was just telling in Westlake

133
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:11,263
Cuppy's bagatelles or meiosis wreck

134
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:18,175

00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:31,487
Subaru's wrecked everywhere

140
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:33,535
That Audi was like I'll just a robot

141
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,559
Wales

142
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,583
Black ice

143
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,119
20 miles the office

144
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,727
Unbelievable but a lot of people died in Texas that's really sad

145
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:47,103
Right total shift wow that sounds sincere

146
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:47,871
Yeah

147
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:55,039
Lot of people died out he's great but a lot of people.

148
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:57,599
Commercial but if you don't buy it out of your going to die

149
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:00,927
About a minute of rambling about a great his wife's car is

150
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:05,791
Play It Again to break reminder give the Darrell have been fatalities

151
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:08,351
Yeah it's a little

152
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:10,911
Yeah it makes me feel bad for making

153
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:11,935
2 fun of something that's

154
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,727
It's awful

155
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,055
One degree removed

156
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:17,823
From being off

157
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:23,199
A move

158
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:23,967
Yeah that's fair

159
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:24,991
So

160
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:27,039
I wanted to cover this episode

161
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:30,111
The Broncos Valentine's Day number 2 because

162
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:33,951
This is the point at which Alex would know that Trump has been acquitted

163
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:38,303
Yes he did his special report on Saturday which I tried to watch

164
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:41,375
Two bit of but it was mostly I'm talking about vaccines

165
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:46,751
Then I got really bored she wanted to hear about his Take On Me

166
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:48,799
He said this was this whole trial was a sham

167
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:55,199
It was all just set up to get Trump so now what happens whenever it worked out the way that we all knew it was going to

168
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:59,295
Alex Ivy I mean it's bulshit but he has actually pretty decent spinner

169
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:02,367
We have the insane trial the president

170
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,903
I suddenly ended

171
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:06,463
You had three days Tuesday Wednesday Thursday

172
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:09,023
Hours a day of total lies against the president

173
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:11,071
30 hours of garbage

174
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:15,423
3 hours by lawyers doing half a decent job

175
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:19,263
Killer kill Trump vice president

176
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:21,823
And they had to put

177
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:23,871
Drop it

178
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:24,895
Because

179
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,431
It was another giant frog

180
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:33,087
So I mean that's that's not a terrible span of like these videos of sugar

181
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:38,719
Yeah conversation about like they weren't

182
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:41,535
They weren't going to vote in conviction

183
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,607
How many Republicans

184
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:47,423
Voted with the 7 I believe

185
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:54,079
More than one is a crazy number

186
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,871
Directly going to be murdered

187
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:56,895
So there's that

188
00:10:57,151 --> 00:11:03,295
I would I would assume he would be a guaranteed job needs a lock

189
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:07,135
We're going to be murdered like I assumed if Mike Pence was in the Senate would be like

190
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:09,951
Yeah I'm going to have to know hanging for me

191
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:13,535
You don't like that kind of feel I prefer not to quit this

192
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:23,519
Constitutional

193
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,079
Gets to message

194
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,615
Stupid

195
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:28,639
I feel like you should

196
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:29,663
No

197
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,943
You should be embarrassed

198
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:31,967
If you even

199
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,759
Try and say they did a half good

200
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,063
You should be

201
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,599
Embarrassed that was

202
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:39,647
Really really shameful stuff

203
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:40,671
It was yeah

204
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:44,511
Do you know we learned a little bit about what happened

205
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:50,911
Philly looting Philadelphia

206
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:53,215
That you and I watched

207
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:55,775
He was talking about fil-A

208
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,567
And then a different point he said

209
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:59,871
Philadelphia

210
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,431
Good stuff Yelp

211
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,199
Good stuff

212
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,991
So when you're at

213
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,015
You know

214
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,295
Radio show host

215
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,319
Sten you come in

00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:17,279
Storm

220
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,815
You got it you got to

221
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,351
Cover the importance

222
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:24,447
Stop right you got to take care of the really important business

223
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:26,239
We've got a lot

224
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,007
We've got

225
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,103
Saturday Night Live is on

226
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:34,943
More jokes about pedophilia not existing

227
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:38,527
And more attacks about children being abused

228
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,295
Ritualist

229
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,575
Strictly because

230
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:42,623
I can tell you a large farmer writing staff

231
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:43,647
Pedophiles

232
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,927
A devil worshiper

233
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:50,815
I'm going to I'm going to have to send a couple of texts

234
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,887
Heard some disturbing news

235
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:56,703
Alex Jones has informed me that

236
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:05,663
So what's going on is that the last two weeks there has been qanon jokes on Saturday Night Live

237
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:08,735
The first one was about the Superbowl commercials

238
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:11,551
And there was a

239
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:12,831
Commercial

240
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:16,415
Qanon recycle eat your Papa John's Pizza on Eureka

241
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:22,815
But no sex trafficking in the basement already democratic

242
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:24,095
Did the character where she was a witch

243
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,399
I got qanon which was really after

244
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,679
Twisted and eating children

245
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:30,751
You know I did an interview with the Weekend Update

246
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:37,151
And Alex is like pretending this is the news

247
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:40,991
She's very mad

248
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,015
A second what

249
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:45,599
SNL cast that we grew up with would have done it

250
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:49,183
If qanon was around then

251
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:53,535
Farley going to do about there just not prepared for that kind of stuff

252
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:57,375
He's not in the in their in their wheelhouse

253
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:59,423
I don't want Adam Sandler doing prank

254
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:03,775
Qanon f*** nevermind I want Adam Sandler doing prank qanon phone calls

255
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:04,799
Sure

256
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,591
So that's important

257
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,919
Very important. Cloud

258
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:13,247
Qanon misconstrue as them

259
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,039
Making jokes of pedophilia doesn't

260
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:16,575
Good job

261
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:19,135
Another

262
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:22,975
You know kind of distasteful to

263
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:27,839
I don't I don't know how to say this but I found this really repulsive

264
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,631
Alex plays

265
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:36,031
Alex plays video of the pile up

266
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,335
Outside Fort Worth

267
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:42,175
100 + car pileup

268
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:47,039
He plays video that someone captured from like the other lane

269
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:49,599
Yeah and so it's just plain VA

270
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:50,623
Tire

271
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:52,415
Like Collision 8

272
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,183
Terrifying

273
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,207
And there is

274
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,999
No real value to it

275
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:58,559
But I was trying to pretend that there is

276
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,095
But I want to give you some

277
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,119
Viewer discretion

278
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:01,887
Should we come back

279
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,935
I don't show

280
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:05,215
Horrible tragedy

281
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,823
To just show you a horrible tragedy

282
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:10,591
Because

283
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,151
I see this

284
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:16,223
I was shown this on Friday by the crew

285
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:17,759
I didn't know

286
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:20,575
After 24 hours of the stuff happening at the Fort Worth and Dallas

287
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,599
What really happened

288
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,135
I've seen the helicopter footage

289
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,927
The couple hundred cars all piled up

290
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:27,743
We come back I'm going to show you what really am

291
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,071
When someone on the ground when it happen

292
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,095
Close

293
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:34,399
I've never seen anything in the Hollywood movie

294
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,423
Like this one

295
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,959
Crashing and flipping exploding

296
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:38,751
Wait till you see

297
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,543
On-the-ground the app

298
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,567
Actual pilot

299
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,615
And the reason I'm going to play it

300
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,919
Explain when we come back

301
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:50,527
So if you were to scratch invited because people were dying

302
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:52,319
7 people died

303
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,599
On the furniture

304
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:57,439
Showing it to save some live

305
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,719
And illustrates

306
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:01,279
Stop right there

307
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,399
We're not going to be on air

308
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,423
New Year

309
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:08,703
And you back

310
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:13,311
Just last year I told you that last year at Black

311
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:16,895
Just don't do it

312
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:19,199
Fun some other secret project for working on

313
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:22,783
Gosh I could do a lot better have my money I'm not doing that talking about

314
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:27,135
I'm about to show you footage of seven people dying

315
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,463
This was

316
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,743
Group home

317
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:32,511
Is f*****

318
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,351
Shocked by the

319
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:38,143
Gross

320
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:38,911
Coldness

321
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:41,727
Yeah the cynical is the

322
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:44,799
I'm going to show you what really happened

323
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:48,383
I was like are you trying to say there's a conspiracy here

324
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,407
He wasn't

325
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:52,223
There is no real value to this unless

326
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:57,087
He wants to turn into a road safety show

327
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,623
It's still a little bit

328
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,903
First of all too soon

329
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:00,927
I don't think you could

330
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,975
Use this footage to illuminate any

331
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:04,767
Particular finer points of

332
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,303
Hazardous Drive

333
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,839
It was just like

334
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:11,167
There is no reason to play this other than shock value

335
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,447
Or something

336
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:13,727
It's B

337
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,775
It's offensive

338
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:18,079
It's nakedly exploitative

339
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,103
And McColl

340
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,639
In a way that like

341
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:21,407
Makes you

342
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,199
Like

343
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:27,039
It is hard not to think that he gets

344
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,319
Some sort of like

345
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:32,927
Weird f***** up like you know that the people who watch the Faces of Death

346
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:33,951
Where you're like

347
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:37,791
There's something that you get out of this that I'll never understand

348
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:40,607
I just won't be there for you

349
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:44,959
Deal breaker

350
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:48,287
He said there's a reason and he's going to become

351
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,567
Cumplir next cycle

352
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:54,175
This makes what kind of has him expressing what that reason is

353
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,199
But I

354
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:57,759
I would say want this reason stupid

355
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,295
2 SE 2nd

356
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:02,111
The connection that he's trying to make

357
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,135
You don't need to watch

358
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:03,903
The video Tik

359
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:06,207
I'm showing you footage of

360
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:06,975
Dallas Tech

361
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:08,255
Texas State live

362
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:11,327
Shop there on top of one of the world's tallest building

363
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:14,655
Icy Wasteland no one on the street

364
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:17,471
Herein

365
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:20,031
Chicago or you're in New York you laugh at that

366
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:23,871
You said he'll we drive all the time while we're not used to it only happens

367
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:24,895
Once or twice

368
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:25,919
A year at

369
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,455
Hundreds of people died

370
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:29,247
Statewide winter unfold

371
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,295
That's a teaching moment

372
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:33,343
Americans haven't been under

373
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,391
Batman under Stalin

374
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:38,975
Or a mile or Fidel Castro or a Hugo Chavez

375
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:45,631
What he's trying to illustrate with playing this video is these people in Texas aren't used ice dry

376
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,399
Rising

377
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:48,191
And so there's a giant pile up

378
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:53,055
Much like Americans aren't used to dealing with a Hitler or Stalin

379
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:58,175
The Tyranny and therefore where metaphorically going to have a pile up

380
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:03,807
Now you don't need to watch that video to make that metaphor at all absolutely no reason

381
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:07,647
Add to your understanding of the metaphor you could just say it

382
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:08,927
It doesn't matter

383
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:11,231
And also what about

384
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:12,767
Booking Obama

385
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:15,839
What about Bill Clinton nothing they were fine

386
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:18,911
They weren't that they were no big deal they were working for the devil yet

387
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:25,823
I think they were according to him about it remember that they were also present

388
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:29,663
He was trying to pretend he was serious backpack

389
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:32,735
Not like one of those people who says that everybody is a devil

390
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:39,391
I'm not like David I could become my best friend in 10 years

391
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:45,023
We've never even had to deal with anything new like I Joe Biden

392
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:45,791
Right

393
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:48,607
I think it was

394
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,143
The most

395
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:54,495
Tenuous connection to make in order to justify playing this video

396
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:56,031
And I don't respect

397
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:57,055
The decision that all I think

398
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:57,823
It's disgusting

399
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,103
Alex

400
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:02,431
Is on the ground

401
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,199
The other line

402
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:07,295
18-wheeler

403
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:11,903
Biggest worth 117 in a minute

404
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:16,255
Alex is saying you're lucky you're not seeing this for the radio audience wow

405
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:18,815
He's playing you could just not

406
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:25,215
Every everybody could be lucky we could all be lucky right now I would like to be lucky

407
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:28,799
You're lucky you're not watching my show you're just listen

408
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:30,847
Intuit

409
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,639
It doesn't add anything it's

410
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:35,967
Outrageous he wanted to watch

411
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:39,039
I think I think you might be might be on Summer

412
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:40,575
To be something with with

413
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:41,343
That's purse

414
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:43,903
I found I found it disgusting

415
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,695
And unacceptable

416
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:49,279
Much like Alex's thinking patterns

417
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:50,559
So

418
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:53,375
He has decided that thousands are dead

419
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,143
From the vaccine

420
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:55,679
Already

421
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:56,703
Why

422
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:57,727
Well for what

423
00:20:58,751 --> 00:20:59,775
Thousand okay

424
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:03,103
Who decides it

425
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:04,639
You got to know that

426
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:09,759
It's actually probably 50 times higher than that 50 times

427
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:10,783
Confirm that okay

428
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:12,831
So

429
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:15,135
I have a stack of this year where there are

430
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:18,208
Thousands of dead admit it I think about 1 in 50

431
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,000
Adverse reactions

432
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:22,048
So if Sal's are dead

433
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,072
Text 50 times

434
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:25,376
No one knows

435
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:30,240
Can you identify

436
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:32,288
Just really quickly if it like

437
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:35,104
The artist surface-level the problem with that ticket

438
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:36,896
No

439
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:38,944
I don't see any problem

440
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,992
It's outrageous

441
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:42,272
Then there's probably 50

442
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:43,040
Tee times more

443
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,576
That means it's proven

444
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:45,344
Right

445
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:46,624
Yep

446
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:48,416
This is dumb I mean like

447
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:51,232
If you would live if if I were listening to a professor

448
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:54,816
School right to lecture

449
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:57,120
They said something like that I would not trust them

450
00:21:57,376 --> 00:22:00,960
To teach the rest of the class I might withdraw I wouldn't

451
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:07,360
Real confident in math class where they were like okay what's 1 + 1 but remember one is probably 50 or

452
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:10,432
Or could be more or could be fewer no one knows

453
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:15,552
Who knows I might be making up the one

454
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:16,320
Now

455
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:17,600
Yikes

456
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:21,184
Not good so that kind of thinking that Alex brings to the table

457
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,208
What is making assumptions

458
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:23,488
And then multiplying things

459
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:28,608
By whatever numbers he chooses feels good about today

460
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:32,960
Is just make sure it up like it has about this usnewsandworldreport sarta

461
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:34,752
What kind of the good news

462
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:40,128
Because it's very very important

463
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:43,456
The McRib

464
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:44,224
Maxine

465
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,016
Administration

466
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:48,832
Straight I'm in concerns of widespread refusal

467
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,392
US News & World Report

468
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,256
It goes on to say that the vast majority of

469
00:22:57,536 --> 00:23:00,096
Are refusing the vaccine because it's voluntary

470
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:03,424
Mystical manipulation I go obit

471
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,448
We did get a sir

472
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:08,544
80 +

473
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:12,640
So what do you do when the vast majority won't take it

474
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:13,920
Navigate percent

475
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:16,224
You take the group

476
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,248
We'll take it

477
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:18,528
Sao

478
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:22,112
80 + percent of them 82%

479
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:24,672
82%

480
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:26,720
That's the statistical game they play

481
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:30,816
It's absolutely has not read this article about the troops of vaccinations

482
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:34,144
He's claiming that the article says that there's a subsection of troops

483
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,704
82% of whom have received the vaccine

484
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:40,800
That's the statistical game Alex claims this article is playing

485
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:43,616
The start of 82% is actually a reference

486
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:46,688
What's the percentage of vaccines the Pentagon has received that have been

487
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:47,456
Administer

488
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:48,992
Probably article quote

489
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:54,624
Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told reporters that department has so far ordered more than 1 million doses

490
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,928
And as of Thursday morning had received roughly

491
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:58,720
968000

492
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:03,072
Of those 800,000 or about 82% have been administered

493
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:05,376
Almost 600,000 were first doses

494
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,656
And more than 200,000

495
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:07,424
A second dose

496
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,824
Scene of the number and made up what it means so they took the small subset of people

497
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,408
Otherwise the people who possibly could have gotten

498
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:21,760
And they're manipulating those numbers to say that those people did get it

499
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:25,344
I don't end of the people outside of those numbers while they didn't get

500
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:31,232
No Alex's just skimmed the article see numbers and written the story in his head about what those numbers mean

501
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:32,512
This is what he does

502
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:34,304
Cuz he's really really bad at

503
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:41,984
I can't believe people actually take him seriously as he does seem to play Madlibs and then search articles for like

504
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:48,384
Numbers to Circle

505
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:54,784
Eighty-two percent under lock

506
00:24:55,040 --> 00:25:01,184
Did it underlined 82%

507
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:06,304
What could that 82% be

508
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:10,656
I can't be bothered to do that kind of work

509
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:12,448
About this

510
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:16,288
You saw usnewsandworldreport I mean the military

511
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,568
Least evil people

512
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:22,688
Said

513
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,480
British military

514
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:27,040
Started before the US Military

515
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:30,624
A bunch of miscarriages

516
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:31,648
Oh

517
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:34,208
Oh but you don't say that US News & World Report

518
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:35,744
You just said the US Military

519
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,792
The rank-and-file pulled out of their ass

520
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:46,496
The pregnancy stuff is so be covered under past episodes so don't get too bogged down at here but this is just another instance

521
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:52,384
How's Alex making more s*** up about this article cuz he hasn't read to get mad about

522
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:55,200
If I were to actually read the article I found this quote

523
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:57,504
From Air Force Brigadier General Paul Fredrick

524
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:01,344
Quote are we seeing people who are declining to it

525
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:03,904
I've heard people say that for a variety of reasons

526
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:04,928
They're pregnant

527
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:06,720
Which is a very reasonable concern

528
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:08,256
They want to talk to her doctor first

529
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:09,792
Very reasonable concern

530
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:12,096
So there are people who said they don't want to get it

531
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:14,144
This whole article is actually a

532
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:19,776
Big problem for Alex's narratives because he's been insistent that the vaccine is mandatory or it's going to be mandatory

533
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:22,336
But the fact that the military is allowing enlisted person

534
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:25,664
Decide if they want to get it or not makes them have to change the subject

535
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:29,504
Because they think he was making his audience afraid about didn't happen

536
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:34,624
He now has to Pivot to make it look like the enlisted persons who don't get the vaccine or somehow being maligned

537
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,648
Which is article doesn't

538
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:36,416
Support

539
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:37,440
He didn't read it

540
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,976
No one listening is going to read it

541
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:40,256
So this technique works

542
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:42,048
Barclay

543
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:45,120
Liquid might as well not to do

544
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:45,888
Yeah

545
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:48,192
And with the military that thing is

546
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:48,960
Your

547
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:51,520
Most people aren't going to look into it

548
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:57,664
And for most people I would imagine that there makes a certain sort of like sense that well the military would be mandate

549
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:59,712
Is there's a military

550
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:10,208
Follow up on that especially not Alex's listeners they be like yeah the military Sportster

551
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:11,488
To do everything

552
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:17,632
Alex claims to have some information that he does not produce

553
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:18,912
Mean season

554
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:19,680
Take me to

555
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:22,240
I got so many adverse reaction death reports

556
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,776
I got over 200 upright beer

557
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:25,568
The last 3 days

558
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:30,176
15 minutes

559
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:37,856
Nicely worried about steps I want to win the fight I was worried about my family everything

560
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:40,672
Things are so crazy now this ain't going to go online

561
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:42,208
Whatever's going on

562
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,280
Whatever's happening a number of people they're killing

563
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:49,120
Whatever's going on baby we ain't never seen nothing like that

564
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:51,936
I thought they

565
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:53,472
Put some in there

566
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:55,776
Oh no don't kill your ass right now

567
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:59,104
See I mean if you have these these 200

568
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:00,640
Want to talk about any of

569
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:03,200
Yeah

570
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:05,760
I would argue that

571
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:08,320
If you just say something and you don't prove it or dammit

572
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:10,112
X-rated at all I could ride ignore it

573
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:10,880
Yeah

574
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:15,488
Especially something that when tied to your other rhetoric is

575
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:16,512
I guess lyson

576
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:18,816
Since to go murder whomever you wants right

577
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:19,840
Because

578
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:21,376
They're killing you in 50

579
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:24,192
15 minutes there killing your grandma right now in 50

580
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:24,960
3 minutes

581
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:28,288
Well you thought you were going to have a lovely 5 years to like

582
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:32,128
Hold your grandma's hand as she dies from the government murder vaccine

583
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,920
But now you don't even have that much

584
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:40,064
The only comfort I really take is hoping that people who listen to this would ask themselves at some point

585
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:43,136
Does Alex actually read the things he talks about

586
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:45,696
And look into it and then that might have rode public

587
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:46,976
Confident with his dumbass

588
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:47,744
I could

589
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:54,144
What are the times when Alex is just rambling about something on are it's something that our old friend

590
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:56,448
Paul Joseph Watson

591
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:58,240
And Paul has struck again

592
00:28:59,008 --> 00:28:59,520
Oh

593
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,568
Lincoln BBC

594
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:05,152
UK government could Grant

595
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:08,480
Catholic minorities I heard this a few months ago an MPR

596
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:12,832
Where are black people are dumb you know where liberals we can say that

597
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:15,136
Did the UK say that

598
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:17,952
U.s. military they're dumb

599
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:20,512
You know they just stay just don't trust us

600
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,840
And so we're going to have vaccine waivers for them

601
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:27,936
Have a job you know how they are

602
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:29,984
White people you're going to take

603
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:35,104
Show the black people not to be scared you roll up your sleeve and take a shot

604
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:38,688
This is just a total

605
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:39,968
Criminal

606
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:40,736
The cover-up

607
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:42,016
Steve

608
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:44,832
All the corruption

609
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:48,160
And the derivatives of the scams of the dollar implosion

610
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:51,232
New World Order the rigging on the cloning

611
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:58,912
So you forget all the crimes they committed

612
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:00,192
And don't do anything about it

613
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:01,216
Dumb plan

614
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:08,640
Is a dumb dumb plan is hard not to think about what would have happened if

615
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:11,712
You and all of your right-wing lunatic dum-dum

616
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:13,504
Friends had decided to take

617
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,272
This whole f***

618
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:16,064
Nothing seriously way back in

619
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,344
In February of last year

620
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:20,160
I think they did

621
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:23,488
Take it too seriously for a minute I apologize

622
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:25,536
In March of last year

623
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:30,144
There is no link

624
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,680
To the BBC in Paul's article

625
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:34,752
There's a link to a story in The Spectator and wanted

626
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:35,520
Sky News

627
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:38,336
This guy news article says nothing about exemption

628
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:44,736
Paul Dudley Cherry picks a very minor side point in The Spectator article which he then turns into his head

629
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:47,808
Because it has the potential to help boost white victimhood feel

630
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:54,976
This is an editorial column and what are the concerns that raises with the idea of vaccine passports being required for

631
00:30:55,232 --> 00:31:00,096
Travel is according to this column vaccine skepticism is higher in non-white communities in the UK

632
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:00,864
Sure

633
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,912
It's really interesting how Paul works here

634
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:05,984
Paul takes this quote from the Sky News article

635
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:09,568
Government insiders stress there's nervousness about

636
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:13,664
When such a system will even be announced publicly let alone rolled out for you

637
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:20,064
If you read the article it does seem to be implied that the nervousness in question is about the vaccine's efficacy and not moving

638
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:20,832
Too fast

639
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:23,648
However here's how Paul uses that line

640
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:31,072
Part of this nervousness is based around the perception that meditating mandating vaccines for travel could be seen as races

641
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:35,168
Because suspicion of vaccine that poor inoculation rates are commonplace

642
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:36,704
Within Bame community

643
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:38,496
He's taking the

644
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:44,896
Concerns raised by the editorial of The Spectator and apply them to the quote for the Sky News article without in any way

645
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:48,224
Demonstrating that the two are connected at all

646
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:54,624
Paul just kind of making things up in order to justify writing a blog post about white identity fears that Alex convened report on any Sue

647
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,160
Super racist play on air

648
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:59,488
Cuz that's what Their audience needs to stay interested

649
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,864
Appreciate the real lack of

650
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:06,144
That went into that

651
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,424
DePaul yeah like

652
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,192
It is

653
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:10,752
It is always we're going to heartwarming

654
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:12,288
To know that some people

655
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,848
Wake up at 9 go to work and they're done at

656
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:20,480
It's nice to know that there's a dream that somebody can accomplish you know

657
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:26,112
Transparent about it

658
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:28,672
So so far I think we seeing

659
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:30,464
Just a real tragedy of

660
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,792
Michelle Weekley crash

661
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:37,888
The makeup nonsense about a couple articles

662
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:41,216
Majlis

663
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:47,616
Jesus Christ

664
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:58,880
Boo

665
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:06,304
You know what we're out of time for out-of-town maybe this is a good teaching moment as well

666
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:08,096
All right now

667
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:11,680
Understand that we're not going to get anywhere with the Coronavirus

668
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:14,240
With him it's too or too far gone

669
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:17,312
But let me toss this out for you Dan

670
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:20,896
If there were fewer cars on the road during a nice store

671
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:24,992
Don't you think that would be better at preventing

672
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:26,528
Yes

673
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:29,088
Right so perhaps if Alex

674
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:31,904
Wanted to do his part to prevent Acts

675
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:34,720
You could have stayed home and done the show remote

676
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:38,560
Now do you understand how those things might be a

677
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:44,960
Nectar tires in the metaphor their Bakery but I also expect he did come at me the problem

678
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:47,264
Bored

679
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:50,336
So when I was coming back from break after

680
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:51,616
Good pathetic growl

681
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:53,664
Very long

682
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:56,736
Passionless growl

683
00:33:56,992 --> 00:34:00,064
He starts complaining about how people think that he

684
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,856
Exported drunk because

685
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:03,904
It somehow was good for his business now

686
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:07,744
I know that I've heard him a hundred times say that is traffic went up

687
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,048
Ridiculously

688
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:14,912
A doll that is really good for his business

689
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:15,680
He was person

690
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:18,240
Secutity Alex was persecuted

691
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:19,520
I got

692
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:20,288
Persecuted

693
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,312
Fort Trump

694
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:22,080
You got

695
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:23,104
Persecuted first

696
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:26,432
We're not losers because we support a present

697
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:28,736
Trump really won

698
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,344
And I don't just say that

699
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:36,160
Any lost yesterday he lost

700
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:37,952
Chinese agent charge

701
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:38,976
Myself

702
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:42,048
Okay you're sold not since about then

703
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:44,352
I will know what's really going on

704
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:45,120
That's what

705
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:45,888
Give me

706
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:47,680
Missing my wife

707
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:52,032
Read that usnewsandworldreport article that that's a good starting point

708
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:55,360
I would I would argue he really wants to know what's not going on

709
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,200
Or he doesn't want to know what is going on

710
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:00,992
Yes yeah

711
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:06,624
He desperately needs not to know what's going on

712
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:09,952
Yeah in order to make this work

713
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:10,720
Which is why you

714
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:13,280
Yeah but there's bad news about Trump

715
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:14,560
But bad news mix

716
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,352
But it's all bad

717
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:18,400
Okay

718
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:19,936
Especially

719
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:21,216
He's not just lost

720
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:25,568
Deal 5000 lawsuit against them

721
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:29,152
He's actually stronger than ever

722
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:33,248
I understand that and if more men were like President Trump

723
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:34,784
It more memory like

724
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:35,808
Broadcast

725
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,392
But he understands leadership

726
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,184
Buy Colonel Travis at the Alamo

727
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:42,720
Drunkenly

728
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:46,048
They said that final otorrino was about to happen

729
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:49,120
I couldn't back down because he believed the causes

730
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:51,680
You want the suicidal

731
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:54,240
I can't get out of here.

732
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:55,776
Jesus Christ said

733
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:57,056
Just want to lay it

734
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:57,824
Down

735
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:58,592
For others

736
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,664
Countdown to

737
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:03,200
Colonel Travis at

738
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:04,480
Nowhere else to go

739
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:05,248
Dora

740
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:06,272
He had nowhere else to

741
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:09,344
Trump may have nowhere else to go

742
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:11,904
Put out a little statement

743
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:14,208
About the impeachment acquittal

744
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:16,256
Yeah and now it's Alex

745
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:18,560
What kind of pissed off is that no one's reading

746
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:19,328
The full state

747
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:22,912
Nowhere do you really see them

748
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:25,216
But you don't really

749
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:28,288
Maybe a line here lying there let's read the whole thing together

750
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:32,384
It's beautiful he said that's totally true

751
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:37,504
National follow the story itself infowars.com

752
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:39,040
Take me home

753
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:39,808
S and P 4

754
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:41,856
President-trump

755
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:43,392
To the office the former president

756
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:44,416
Worcester State

757
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:45,184
Celebrating

758
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:49,792
Damn right he's a man the arena

759
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:51,328
I've overlooked is under attack

760
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:58,752
Coming after you what you think I did you think I did this. To be attacked

761
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:08,992
Apartments in Cimarron with you some country club

762
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:10,272
That I do think

763
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:14,624
Yes I agree with that looks like me

764
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:20,512
Put a gun to my head I'm not back until you dumb sons of b******

765
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:26,400
Your background

766
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:29,728
Real shame that no one's reading the Trump statement

767
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:33,568
I do I do appreciate that

768
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,896
It does it does appear that for most of the world

769
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:39,456
We're finally passed like half and to deal with

770
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:40,992
The stuff he says on the daily

771
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:44,320
Everybody

772
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:45,600
Enjoyed

773
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:49,952
I have personally some trouble whenever I see too much of him

774
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:50,720
Yeah

775
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:51,744
Yeah

776
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,512
I don't want

777
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:56,096
I don't want people that I would normally think of it saying

778
00:37:56,352 --> 00:38:00,448
To talk about him and not because I want exclusive domain over Alex

779
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:02,240
I just don't think it's worth it now

780
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,312
I don't see this is a problem for us

781
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:06,336
What's 2

782
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:10,688
I don't value my own time but I value other people's house

783
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:12,224
Save yourself

784
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:18,624
We're too far gone

785
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,184
B kick us out of the mall we're not supposed

786
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:21,952
To be there

787
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:23,744
Will be on the roof

788
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:30,912
So Alex does get around to reading the statement I will say it in full but he does add some commentary

789
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:32,192
It is a little bit ridiculous

790
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,728
Spell president

791
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:36,032
Never gone through anything like it

792
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:37,056
And that's true

793
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:39,360
The key

794
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:41,920
And it continues because our phone

795
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:42,688
Not forget

796
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:44,736
Almost 75 million people

797
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:45,760
Way more than that

798
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:46,784
The greatest number

799
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,576
Everpress sitting president

800
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:49,344
Devoted

801
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:51,648
I was just a few months ago

802
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:55,488
They lie about it though

803
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,048
He won those others

804
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:58,816
6 days by half

805
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:00,096
Do you want to buy

806
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:01,120
Five points on a

807
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:04,448
Understand

808
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,032
Wait more than quadruple the number of

809
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:09,568
It's weather

810
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:10,592
Crapping their britches

811
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:13,408
That's more than quadruple the number of Victory number

812
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:15,968
Yeah

813
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:17,760
Kind of feels a lot like that

814
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:24,160
50 * 50

815
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:26,720
I feel like Alex doesn't know much about

816
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:28,000
Numbers

817
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,048
You know very little

818
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:30,816
So

819
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:32,864
Complaining

820
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:36,448
And of course this leads into him yelling a bit about

821
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:39,008
Abuse towards children and I don't show her

822
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,080
I don't respect his position on the issue

823
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:48,480
I got a lot of complaints about snla I think we can let that one go I don't think we need to worry

824
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:50,528
About that is really not

825
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:51,552
Any reason

826
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:54,112
To engage

827
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:55,136
That's one break

828
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:56,160
It comes back

829
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:57,440
I want to tell you

830
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,488
He's not killing

831
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:00,256
Doing time

832
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:06,400
Argue even mentioning snl.on you're apparently political talk show would

833
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:08,704
Be killing time

834
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,496
You know debatable if it's killing time

835
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:12,288
This next minute

836
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,568
Definitely not

837
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:19,968
It sounds like it's going to be

838
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:22,784
In the snowstorm and rebroadcast

839
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:24,832
Luther show

840
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,624
Infowars live

841
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,648
5628

842
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:28,928
Sunday night

843
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:32,000
Is that coming up if everyone can get it reduced calling

844
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:33,792
Because it is

845
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:34,816
It's insane

846
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:37,376
Yes

847
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:39,168
Ask him to come to work

848
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,192
Oh my God

849
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,800
Emperor Palpatine

850
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,080
The song

851
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:49,408
He's like a hundred generation clone of Palpatine

852
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,736
You know that happened a long time ago in a galaxy far far away

853
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:53,760
Tom

854
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:54,784
14

855
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,112
Oh you don't know about Star Wars

856
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:59,136
Thousand Clowns

857
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:01,696
Is going to beat Houston Michelle

858
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:07,072
I have a lot of stuff

859
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:08,864
I got too much of a

860
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:10,400
Installing out

861
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:11,168
Does

862
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:11,936
Weather for May

863
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:13,984
Play five minutes

864
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:14,752
How to go

865
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,288
It's because

866
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:23,200
This is surreal mean it is it's just the real is too much

867
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:23,968
There's too much

868
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:25,504
Just got a refund

869
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,832
Tom Peppard name being similar to Palpatine

870
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:29,600
For a bit

871
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:31,136
Dick

872
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:36,768
What a dick people dying outside people dying outside let's see if Owen can get

873
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:37,536
To work

874
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:38,560
Yeah

875
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:39,328
Great

876
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:40,096
Good boss

877
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:44,192
Good boss love working for you buddy I will say what I would ask

878
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:50,592
Respect of Alex as a boss broadcast if you can't get in

879
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:56,991
Kind of a stand-up guy that is

880
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:58,527
Also Scrooge being like you get Chris

881
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:01,343
I guess that's

882
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:05,951
Maybe it's killing some time

883
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:08,767
Here's the video of the granny being thrown off cliff

884
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:16,447
Replace video that's

885
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:20,287
A guy or rolling a woman in a wheelchair

886
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:21,567
Through a park

887
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:24,127
And that ends with him dumping her

888
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:26,175
So it is like that Conan O'Brien

889
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:27,711
New Walker Texas Ranger schedule

890
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:28,479
It's

891
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:31,039
Well there's a little bit of lovin

892
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:34,111
There's some racial undertones for Alex

893
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:40,511
White Lightning

894
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:45,887
Liberal

895
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:47,423
Illiberal

896
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:50,495
This video is a campaign ad

897
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:51,775
That was targeting

898
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:52,799
Paul Ryan

899
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:54,591
Because you could cut

900
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:58,175
Take that take Medicare

901
00:42:58,431 --> 00:43:00,735
This is at least a two-year-old ad

902
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:05,599
That was against the GOP that Alex's play against some kind of attack on

903
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:09,183
Liberals are subtitle man-to-man

904
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:17,119
I was like this is business real and Alex clearly hadn't watched it and advantages new was an old lady

905
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:18,143
If you look

906
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:20,447
Pretty surprised when the thing comes up

907
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:23,519
Call Paul Ryan

908
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:27,871
Hold on one second

909
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:30,431
Subway

910
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:31,455
So Alex

911
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:35,039
No he's he's he's he's a bit of a fatalistic mood

912
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:36,319
You know

913
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:37,855
We already said earlier that

914
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:39,135
You know we might not be here

915
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:39,903
Next year

916
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,951
F*** that we might not be here tomorrow

917
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:43,743
I got a final second

918
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:45,279
A bunch of news I want to hear

919
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:46,559
I bought a pair on that

920
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:50,911
Tell you all this license elmet it's been a great pleasure to be on air

921
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:51,935
What do you

922
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:53,727
I don't know how long I'm going to be here

923
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:55,775
Things are so bad things are going so fast

924
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:58,591
Now that I'm not even sure will be here tomorrow that's week

925
00:43:59,103 --> 00:43:59,615
Next year

926
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:01,151
It's all up to God right now but

927
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:01,919
The bottom fell out

928
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:06,015
It's just their euthanizing the old people

929
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:07,039
We've got power

930
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:09,343
5% death rate

931
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:10,111
Text shot

932
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:10,879
Weather

933
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:12,415
Successfully covered up most areas

934
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:13,183
Okay

935
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:15,231
That's a ridiculous number

936
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:16,511
Okay hold on

937
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:19,327
Even then just make up numbers like that

938
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:20,351
No

939
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:21,375
But even then what

940
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:22,911
Current but nevermind

941
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:24,191
I don't even know

942
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:25,215
So stopped

943
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:26,495
Stop just stop

944
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:31,615
One of the things I think is interesting is Alex's talking pretty fatalistically stalking a lot of

945
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:32,639
We are gone

946
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:38,271
We're done it looks like that I won't say that I'm falling for it again

947
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:41,087
Or anything like that

948
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:44,671
Looking for real but I do need to tell you this but I do think it's important was that

949
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:46,975
He's playing a lot of doors

950
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:55,679
Who played are you learning songs by the doors as Bumper Music

951
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:57,471
And my friend

952
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:00,287
A lot of things

953
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:01,311
Erroneously

954
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:03,359
Bums me out mostly cuz I don't like the doors

955
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:08,735
Such a scent like the mood of the music that he's playing

956
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:10,783
On a very regular basis

957
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:14,623
Like multiple coming in from commercials per show

958
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:16,927
The Aria Dora Dora songs

959
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:19,999
Has the cone of a dirge

960
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:21,023
Okay

961
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:23,327
Let's see how this goes

962
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:26,655
I just I think

963
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:31,007
I will say that if it doesn't end soon and he keep playing the doors

964
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:32,031
You know what

965
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:33,567
One thing that I realized

966
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:35,359
After the impeachment trial

967
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:36,895
Was that

968
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:39,711
Don't think that's

969
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:40,991
What's the appropriate punishment

970
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:44,319
And I think the same thing for Alex I don't

971
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:45,343
Appropriate

972
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:46,623
Punishment is to liked

973
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:47,391
Take them off the air

974
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:49,951
I don't think the appropriate punishment for Trump

975
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:51,743
To take him away

976
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:52,511
From politics

977
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:54,815
They should have no money

978
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:56,351
0 money

979
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:58,911
Take their money if the impeachment trial was like

980
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:00,703
Yeah sure run for office again

981
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:01,727
With

982
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:02,495
Nothing

983
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:03,775
I got broke

984
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:05,823
I think it's people do

985
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:07,103
Things that have Civic

986
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:10,175
Are civil penalties

987
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:15,551
And what have you and I don't I don't want Mike what I'm about to say to be like Alex

988
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:18,111
By people who he has Ross

989
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:20,927
Then I'm not particularly concerned

990
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:22,975
With him having money or not having money

991
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:24,255
I'm concerned about

992
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:25,023
The impact that

993
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:28,863
He can have a greater punishment for him

994
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,143
Is the illumination

995
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:31,679
Explanation

996
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:32,703
Of how

997
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:34,495
Bulshit everything he does is

998
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:37,567
Sprite the how is basically defraud

999
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:38,847
People with

1000
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:40,383
Posture

1001
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:41,919
Like some guy who's again

1002
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:44,223
A system when all he really is a f****** idiot

1003
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:46,015
Right and I want to take

1004
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:47,807
Take away the thing he cares about both

1005
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:51,647
Memories of Colonel Travis

1006
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:55,487
I'll take those two if I could sue him for those

1007
00:46:57,023 --> 00:47:00,095
This show has been largely devoid of

1008
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:01,631
Meaning

1009
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:02,911
No

1010
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:09,567
Pop culture grieving because Alex has found a video of

1011
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:10,335
AMC

1012
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:12,895
Well

1013
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:13,919
Medium fries

1014
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:17,503
Current Stars review they did a little song

1015
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:20,831
About the vaccine and Alex is not happy about

1016
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:22,367
Run DMC

1017
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:23,903
Members now put out

1018
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:24,671
This

1019
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:28,255
I guess the money must be good this type of garbage I got something even sick

1020
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:41,055
I think there's

1021
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:42,847
Plenty of valid criticisms

1022
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:44,127
About this song

1023
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:51,807
That it's too good for the rest of us this isn't this isn't really my territory to keep receipt

1024
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:52,575
Too much

1025
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:55,391
But I will say that Alex was

1026
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:58,975
Far less critical of bike Adams rap career

1027
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:03,071
Weird Ebola Reston

1028
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:06,911
I mean I respect what they're doing it

1029
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:08,703
Stay here and after

1030
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:09,471
Preschool special

1031
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:10,239
From DMC

1032
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:11,519
It is

1033
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:13,055
ESA

1034
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:16,127
I just I don't really know

1035
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:19,711
I don't know it just seems weird that Alex would care that much

1036
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:23,039
Because he's filling f******

1037
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:26,111
Time what I'm saying

1038
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:29,183
Like this is what he spends his other time

1039
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:29,951
The show

1040
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:31,999
Bill Gates says he wants to

1041
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:32,767
Populate you

1042
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:34,815
You're going to take your shots.

1043
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:36,607
What is Bill Gates

1044
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:37,631
Disappeared

1045
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:40,959
I will buy

1046
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:41,983
My money

1047
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:44,287
Gates and solve the problem

1048
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:48,895
Alex plays a video from like a YouTube channel called omsom

1049
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:50,175
I believe I'm some

1050
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:51,199
And it's like

1051
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:54,015
It's for kids it's an educational video for kids

1052
00:48:54,271 --> 00:49:00,415
They've a big series of videos of what would happen if blanket disappeared

1053
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:04,767
Numbers disappeared

1054
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:07,071
Okay

1055
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:09,375
Good animations for kids

1056
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:14,751
Sanders what about what would happen if Bill Gates disappeared and some of it is like well he's a big philanthropist

1057
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:18,847
Sabata at money would be drawing

1058
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:22,175
Warren Buffett would miss his best friend

1059
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:25,759
It's like what are you commenting on this

1060
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:31,135
First thing that he can engage with on a equal footing

1061
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:31,903
Yeah

1062
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:33,951
Embarrassing

1063
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:36,511
It's for kids

1064
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:39,327
I mean I'm not

1065
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:42,399
I'm not going to say that that doesn't have

1066
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:44,447
Kind of propaganda feel to it

1067
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:47,519
I'm not going to say that making a video where you like

1068
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:51,103
What if Bill Gates was gone at that didn't also include like

1069
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:51,871
Well

1070
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:58,271
It's possible that his money would be shuffled back into the economy and put into places where

1071
00:49:58,527 --> 00:50:02,623
Maybe he doesn't have a visitor he's a philanthropist but maybe he's still got 20 billion dollars

1072
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:07,487
Might be complicated for children might be a little bit difficult except

1073
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:11,327
To the point that is not the critique that I looked at

1074
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:16,447
I get what you're saying I here I here

1075
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:20,799
Maybe in a little bit weird but it's also a giant public figure

1076
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:24,639
I didn't watch the whole thing

1077
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:26,175
But the stuff that Alex plays

1078
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:27,199
Is just like

1079
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:28,479
All right this isn't like

1080
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:31,295
Bill Gates is our God

1081
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:36,159
You know what if he went more like a Starship Troopers wrote where is like

1082
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:39,231
Doesn't it seem a little bit weird that we're making these kind of

1083
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:42,047
Campaign videos

1084
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:43,071
Public figures

1085
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:46,399
What we should be doing is talking about the issues

1086
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:49,727
Stuff like that but even then you talk about a kids video

1087
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:55,103
I know how you can tell that argument Cuts both directions

1088
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:56,639
Perceptive

1089
00:50:56,895 --> 00:50:57,407
Before

1090
00:50:57,919 --> 00:50:59,199
I don't know I I just

1091
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:01,247
You know I was I was feeling like

1092
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:02,783
There wasn't much

1093
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:05,087
Happening here but there was a lot happening

1094
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:07,391
You don't like it was really disgusting

1095
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:12,767
The Athena playing of that the crash yeah

1096
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:14,303
You going right into an Adesa

1097
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:19,423
Talking about

1098
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:21,471
Amanda

1099
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:22,751
No really makes you think

1100
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:24,543
This is how we ended the show

1101
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:28,639
Going to an Incredible God for the frozen roads

1102
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:30,175
Road Warrior level crashes

1103
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:33,503
And hopefully back tomorrow 11 a.m. Central

1104
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:34,783
What do I broadcast

1105
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:35,551
AAA job

1106
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:41,695
Bomb National file

1107
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:45,535
There is no reason that he needed

1108
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:47,327
To come in at all nope

1109
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:50,911
Tom pappert is in

1110
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:53,471
You know he's not he's not in Texas

1111
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:58,079
Like he doesn't remotely Alex could have just set up a little like a man

1112
00:51:58,847 --> 00:52:01,919
No need no need this is all for nothing

1113
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:02,687
Is all the way

1114
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:05,247
The house on Valentine's Day

1115
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:06,271
Alright

1116
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:12,927
Okay so they debuted with his first time I saw that there was a new commercial for my Patriot Supply

1117
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:15,231
And Alex is at their warehouse

1118
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:20,863
Betty's in Salt Lake City Utah

1119
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:22,399
Clip

1120
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:23,423
My dick

1121
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:29,823
Eastbay Alyssa warehouse must have been why he went or at least part of it.

1122
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:30,847
Baby it's baby it's

1123
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:36,479

00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:38,527
I love you you talk bud

1125
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:41,343
The number one vacation destination that's thoroughly

1126
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:43,647
CIA

1127
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:44,927
I don't have any clips of it

1128
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:51,327
I'm talking about a great the food

1129
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:52,607
If you were to say hey

1130
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:54,911
All you beers are all you listeners

1131
00:52:55,423 --> 00:53:01,567
You're lucky not to be watching this video right now but it said you just didn't play it damn true

1132
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:04,895
Restrain

1133
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:09,503
Did you know that if

1134
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:12,831
If you get my Patriot Supply stuff and you open up one of those buckets

1135
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:13,599
What's up

1136
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:14,623
Be careful

1137
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:17,951
You might not be able to get it close cuz there's so much

1138
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:23,327
Is that like three times

1139
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:24,095
What is ologist

1140
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:25,631
What it's all just a buffer

1141
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:29,983
But like you pull it up and then it pops out and they're like

1142
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:32,543
You can eat it forever I would

1143
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:33,567
Be Charmed

1144
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:34,335
By that

1145
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:37,407
Yeah I don't know

1146
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:38,943
I don't know how you found this

1147
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:39,711
Episode 2B

1148
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:42,271
A little frustrating

1149
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:43,807
Children's videos

1150
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:47,135
Run-DMC vaccine songs SNL complaining

1151
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:49,183
It's like everything receipts of trivial

1152
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:51,743
I feel like it's trivial stuff is happening

1153
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:53,023
Yeah yeah

1154
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:54,815
I think that I think that Alex

1155
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:55,583
Start

1156
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:57,119
Some level didn't have as much

1157
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:59,679
Skin in the game with the impeachment as

1158
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:01,983
You might have thought he might and then

1159
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:06,335
The spin of they just played clips of Democrats saying stuff and how do you defend

1160
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:07,359
Against that

1161
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:08,639
As if that was

1162
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:09,663
Legally relevant

1163
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:10,431
No kidding

1164
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:11,967
I think that works for him

1165
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:12,735
So

1166
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:14,271
I don't know

1167
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:17,343
I want to see if he keeps playing the doors

1168
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:20,671
Yeah and if that hat is a bad omen

1169
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:30,143
I can only imagine if he comes in for break with like the sound of silence so we know it's over

1170
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:30,911
It's just

1171
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:32,703
He's just sing along with Elliot

1172
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:35,263
It's method

1173
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:41,407
It starts raining

1174
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:47,807
I paid $50,000

1175
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:49,855
Set the mood

1176
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:50,879
How I feel

1177
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:55,743
If you can afford to have your environment reflect your interview

1178
00:54:56,511 --> 00:54:57,791
Yeah but I'm just

1179
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:00,607
Well

1180
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:07,263
I guess we'll be back to find out what the next step in this adventure is

1181
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:08,287
Dot-com

1182
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:12,127
