1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alexandra Thurston color

2
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,712
The

3
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,552
Mellow Waters of Alex Jones I don't know what I'm saying

4
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:30,976
Control right there I don't know but it's

5
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:34,048
Times in the world

6
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,328
The middle of the week

7
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:36,352
Coming down

8
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:41,984
Having a chat with you this

9
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:43,008
But

10
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:44,032
Let me ask you a

11
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:44,800
What's up

12
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:46,592
How much do you know about Alex

13
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:47,616
So much

14
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:48,384
Okay

15
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,688
I'm going to be honest with you

16
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:56,320
B Alex Jones levels of honesty

17
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:02,464
As the front of the show I get to

18
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,816
Shock and offend you with the words of Alex Jones

19
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:10,400
And auto contact

20
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:11,168
Campaign tonight

21
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,240
Shocking

22
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:17,568
Just go up there all these are ready

23
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:21,920
Lyft call their mom's gay

24
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:29,344
Yell at them for being offended by it

25
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:34,720
Before we get going

26
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:37,792
Go to your demilitarized intellectuals

27
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:39,328
Jessica

28
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:41,632
A couple of things

29
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:45,472
For joining me on the last episode

30
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:47,008
Super fun to interview him

31
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:50,080
And this is coming out Wednesday you can still go see him tonight

32
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:52,896
At Schubas Tavern in Chicago if you're in town

33
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:56,224
Just wanted to say that again

34
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:56,992
Super cool

35
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:58,528
Sorry you couldn't be there Jordan

36
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:04,928
Weird interview

37
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,840
I still felt weird

38
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,264
Also I'd like to say thank you to all our new friend David

39
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,336
Thanks for donating to the show this one's going out to you

40
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:27,456
That was just for you

41
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:33,856
Whenever someone donates their own policy

42
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:38,464
You're officially a policy wonk David thanks for joining up

43
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,768
And if you guys want to donate there's a link

44
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:45,120
Knowledge fight

45
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:48,192
Or just go to patreon.com

46
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:50,496
They're going to donate please do it

47
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:51,520
You don't have to

48
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:52,288
Anyway

49
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:56,128
Great selfie stick of donations Alex might need some in the

50
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:58,944
Transition game

51
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:05,856
Built I want to make this statement clear I said at the beginning of the last episode and I stand by it

52
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:09,184
I really don't think that we have any business talking about his divorce

53
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,768
I don't like what I'm seeing

54
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:16,096
I don't like what I'm seeing in terms of

55
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:18,912
Articles on unnamed website

56
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:19,680
I don't like

57
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:20,960
Takes that I'm seeing

58
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:25,568
I really don't like people dancing in the mud as it were

59
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:26,336
Weird

60
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:29,408
Because the machine

61
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,688
Of the internet

62
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:31,456
Is so

63
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:32,736
Celery

64
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,296
You get you

65
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,320
Fly off

66
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:39,904
As little bit as little of your

67
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,440
Neurologist pasa

68
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,536
Denied Sandy Hook

69
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:48,096
Yeah that's awfully miserable but

70
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,680
Yeah so much more of a monster

71
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:58,080
It's like if you have a band that you know a lot about Indie like people only know their greatest hits

72
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:09,088
Song they know Alex Jones

73
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,112
Worst-hit

74
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:13,952
Words like deep catalog you should really get into some of the

75
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,232
The album cuts

76
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:16,512
The b-sides

77
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:19,839
There's not just You're the Inspiration

78
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,887
It's not just Saturdays in the park

79
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:25,215
Chicago

80
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:28,287
Lots of 25 or 6 to 4

81
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:34,687
A great song I didn't know you knew so much about music

82
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:39,551
Does anybody really know what time it is

83
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,855
Another great Chicago song

84
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:43,647
Anyway

85
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:50,047
I really really really want to encourage people to stop paying so much attention to the divorce.

86
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,351
Cuz a lot of it is his business

87
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:54,911
Yeah a lot of it is not really

88
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,959
Necessarily

89
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:57,983
Real

90
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:00,287
In our in our world

91
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:03,103
Okay I would like to know more

92
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:06,431
A lot of it is permanent

93
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:08,479
It's a lot of it is personal

94
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:11,807
We don't really know the Dynamics that are going on

95
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:13,087
In his household

96
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:15,135
We don't know anything about his

97
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,159
Ex-wife

98
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:18,719
We don't know anything about that world

99
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,791
And we studiously try to avoid

100
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,583
Yeah and it cuz it is November

101
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:26,911
To delve into that

102
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:31,263
Another reason that everybody is interested in the reason that things became

103
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:35,103
Immediately interesting to people about this was

104
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:38,943
His lawyer said that you playing a character and that was

105
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,247
Defense that they used or we're intending

106
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:43,551
To use

107
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:47,647
And the reason that this isn't even interesting really is that he makes my claim

108
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:53,791
Across-the-board on his own show whenever he wants to dodge responsibility for something as in the case when he

109
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,839
Screamed about beating up Adam Schiff

110
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:56,863
He said that his

111
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,655
Ramps for performance

112
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,679
For their jokes

113
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:02,239
He was joking about so many other

114
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:05,567
Turn things like everybody else

115
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,591
It was doing it so I may

116
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,919
All the time

117
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:13,503
And if you are talking about his listeners like your

118
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:17,343
You're not actually engaging with Wyatt is they listen

119
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,159
They do not care

120
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:24,767
No probably don't care he says he's a performance artist

121
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:27,583
To them is as much a wink

122
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:31,167
As it is a mission of

123
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:35,519
Guilter that he doesn't believe in what he says it's just him being like

124
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:36,543
Hey guys

125
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,079
I'm a performance artist

126
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,615
To get my kids

127
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:42,431
Like that kind of

128
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,223
The audience would believe

129
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,759
The globalists are trying to

130
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,295
To torpedo his family

131
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:51,647
And he's just doing what he's got to do sometimes that means you have to

132
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:55,487
Give the lie to protect your family and the timing of this

133
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:59,327
Couldn't be more perfect for Puerto Rico

134
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:03,935
It's especially if you are ugly

135
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,471
Now is when you strike

136
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:08,799
That's the tracking know Alex Jones he was nothing

137
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:14,175
Global is for a long time he was just a thorn in their side now that he has some power

138
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:18,783
That's when you back his ex-wife I don't know I don't know what's going on

139
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:25,183
An argument about the globalist being real fell apart

140
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:30,047
Especially

141
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,071
Look

142
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:34,655
There's a lot of salacious fun stuff that you could make fun of

143
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:38,239
We choose not to do that we choose not to engage in that

144
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:40,799
Because we sincerely believe

145
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,335
The taking Alex

146
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,103
Faith

147
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:45,151
Entirely on his word

148
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,199
And researching his words

149
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:48,223
Is a much

150
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,271
Much more scathing attack

151
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:56,671
And it's something that he can't deflect from

152
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,951
Words actually

153
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,999
Engage with us

154
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,815
Like there would be an argument

155
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:05,119
There wouldn't be something that they could say

156
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:08,703
They might actually be like

157
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:11,007
It depends on how deep cognitive dissonance ghosts

158
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:13,311
But I mean I'm not saying a lot of

159
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:19,711
Do you want her to

160
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:25,855
Save-a-ho over here at that's not where I'm at that's not my business convert his flock

161
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,903
As much as I am trying to

162
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,695
I don't know what are we doing

163
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:36,095
Alex Jones listeners or is it to the

164
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:38,143
I guess make a time capsule

165
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:44,799
I don't know what we're doing multimillion-dollar book deal with

166
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,335
Bingo

167
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:51,455
Review the 2016 election

168
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:53,503
Through The Eyes of Alex

169
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,295
Anyway

170
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,855
Either that or just masturbating into the void

171
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:00,159
That's way more likely

172
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:09,119
A subject that will be what this episode is this is episode part 2 in a

173
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:13,471
Series that I would like to call Alex Jones

174
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:16,287
When you do stuff like

175
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:18,847
The obsessing about him

176
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:22,431
Or it wasn't even him it was his lawyer saying that he's playing a character

177
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:24,991
When you obsess over stuff like that

178
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:29,855
And you clown on him real hard like Media Matters as and all these websites

179
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,391
The pop culture website

180
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:33,183
All these people on Twitter

181
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,719
When you obsess about this stuff

182
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:35,999
It comes out in his divorce

183
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,303
All you're doing is playing into his hands

184
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:39,839
My evidence for that

185
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:40,863
Is

186
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,655
The episode we're going to be listening to today

187
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:47,775
It is from Monday

188
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,311
Sure like

189
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:55,199
Did all of our Relentless only made him stronger

190
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:59,295
I'm rubber you're glue

191
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,087
F****** work

192
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:03,135
Demeanor demeanor defense

193
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:10,303
This is episode from April 17th

194
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,351
Is a special report

195
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,887
But he put out in the evening

196
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,983
I will say I think it was unadvised

197
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,263
Of him

198
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,103
I think his lawyers probably should have stopped him from recording this

199
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:26,431
Cuz I think he touches on some stuff that may come up in court

200
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:32,831
I don't care about like respecting his personal life when he bring stuff

201
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,111
That's the line for me

202
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:40,511
Surrounded

203
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,535
Weather

204
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,095
A slow but sure biography of him

205
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:46,911
Of course there is a new entry in this episode

206
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:49,471
Get excited for that

207
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:52,543
When you at kill another dog

208
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,823
Nope that monster

209
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,103
Nope

210
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:58,431
When you

211
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:01,503
Betty murdered

212
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:07,903
Jordan step away from murdering all four of your children that's

213
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:21,471
What do you want to say is because

214
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:24,287
He doesn't actually say he killed a dog he's just saying

215
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:26,847
You kind of sometimes have to kill a dog

216
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:32,223
It's all right how about the time you put a guy in a coma knocked out

217
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:38,111
When he was younger

218
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:42,207
Who cares we're not here to plan a prosecution

219
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,255
Maybe that is what

220
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:50,655
Does episode 23 minute video all I've done is cut out

221
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,959
Like a couple of gaps here and there

222
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,263
A couple plugs

223
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:58,335
So it's not couple times he says infowars.com

224
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:01,663
Yeah Joseph

225
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:08,063
30% off of whatever there's 30% off Easter sale still going on

226
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,111
He's going to get that in there

227
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,415
This is what happens

228
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:14,975
When you don't actually engage without

229
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:17,279
On his level what are you talkin about

230
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:19,327
This is the sort of thing that you can do

231
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,863
To spend his way out

232
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,655
And still keep his cult

233
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,191
Ladies

234
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,471
Here we go here's the

235
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:27,007
You see that headline

236
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:31,359
Google says Rogue vendor violated guidelines

237
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:34,687
Contractors

238
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:37,247
Business Insider Google responding

239
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:40,063
Lesson 24 hours after this broke

240
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:42,111

241
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,135
And also on our

Play the gentleman

243
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:48,255
All we do is break

00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:54,655
Cutting Edge inside and tell from our amazing sources Lakers and Patriots

245
00:12:55,167 --> 00:13:00,543
Flip a shows video opens with him holding up his cell phone that shows this

246
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,359
A Business Insider article

247
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,407
Great that he believes

248
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,431
5.

249
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,455
Riveting

250
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,223
Television

251
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:11,551
Did indeed

252
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,343
Pointing to an article you

253
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,367
Cannot read

254
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:17,183
Nope with just the headline I'm sure

255
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:23,583
Totally

256
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,631
This is a continuation of

257
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:30,495
It got started a little bit before the episode

258
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,543
Of the show with Mike cernovich

259
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,311
Mike cernovich

260
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,359
Was discussed on our last episode

261
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,151
He's stuck around Austin

262
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:41,247
Great

263
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,551
Each and every f******

264
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,855
Crevice of your shoe

265
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:48,927
No no no no it's a virgin

266
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,975
He's broken a huge story

267
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:54,303
That is the Google

268
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:57,375
Trying to censor Indie list

269
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,655
Infowars

270
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,679
From their search engine

271
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:00,959
Really

272
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:01,983
No

273
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:14,015
But that's a story that's a story that would be an interesting story at at this point it is

274
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,295
Like I could

275
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,319
Kind of

276
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,855
I could kind of believe it

277
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:21,951
Like based on all the stuff we talked about I'm not saying that that

278
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:23,743
Could happen or would happen

279
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:24,511
Open because

280
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,279
You know what

281
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,559
Yeah

282
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:29,887
I could almost see that being the

283
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:33,215
Is important to consider

284
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:34,239
Hey this is just

285
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,519
Google policy

286
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,799
It's company policy

287
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,615
If a site is being delisted

288
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:42,687
They have to give a formal letter

289
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,711
To that company

290
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:47,039
So it's legitimately being delisted

291
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,063
He would have

292
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:49,599
Evidence Reaper

293
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,647
He would have that letter from Google

294
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:53,695
It's not happening

295
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:57,535
It's entirely impossible unless he pulls out the letter

296
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,815
Now keep in mind

297
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:02,655
All he does is break massive stories

298
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,191
That are truthful

299
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:07,519
By his own words right there

300
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,311
This story is bogus as f***

301
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,079
Right

302
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,359
So

303
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,383
Do you want to know the truth

304
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:19,039
Should we wait until this develops

305
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:27,999
Because OK Google has admitted

306
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:32,863
Or have hired excuse me 10,000 people

307
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:37,471
To do around the listing stuff on the internet they say is fake news

308
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,751
That's the big story

309
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,543
Infowars

310
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:43,103
If they can censor you they can sense your me

311
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,919
What should be prominent is what you up vote

312
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:49,247
She gets the best ratings with people promote

313
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,271
Interstate

314
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,063
Watch the expanse

315
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:55,391
Takes you count absolutely Google has a right to bacta

316
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,415
So they should be

317
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,487
Maybe

318
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:03,327
I mean I do have a lot of artificial traffic

319
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,399
Paul Joseph Watson both have

320
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:08,191
Outrageously High numbers of

321
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:09,983
Fake Twitter followers

322
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,263
Based on

323
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,055
No Twitter audits that have been done

324
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:15,615
I don't know I don't know

325
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,919
That argument ism

326
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:22,271
I'm going to do it for me like his own argument for why something should be censured

327
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,551
That's not enough for me

328
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:25,599
Gordon's

329
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:29,439
10000

330
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:36,095
What are we let him hang himself a little more before we get to the fact that was your plan

331
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:38,143
Remember though

332
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:44,543
Ilevel Google

333
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:50,175
How does he know

334
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:51,967
Betrayal

335
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:54,271
What are the sources for at least multiple years

336
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:59,391
He just works in contacts

337
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:04,767
Yes I'll probably work he's doing

338
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,815
Regular Susan Rice nozin

339
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:10,911
Susan Wright news was a bogus story also

340
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:11,935
Complete bulshit

341
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:17,311
I also another fun news story that Mike cernovich broke over the weekend

342
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:20,127
Was he went to one of these the tax protest

343
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,455
We didn't have to be

344
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,479
In Berkeley

345
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:31,135
He was in Austin at the protesters counter protesting as it were

346
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:34,975
He put out a video of him with his cell phone

347
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:38,559
On himself a selfie Periscope video

348
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:42,399
He's like there's a bunch of people

349
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,935
You can see behind

350
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,727
There's another guy

351
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:48,031
Who caught another angle of the video

352
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:51,103
As far away as humanly possible he's like across the street

353
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:54,431
No it's just like a couple people who are like

354
00:17:54,943 --> 00:18:01,087
Come on they're just sort of moving him out of the way he's walking in front of them while they ask

355
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:04,159
Scored him out of the protest area

356
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:10,559
It's so funny it's so it's so funny to see the Long View of him acting like he's

357
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:13,119
He's in the middle of a huge crowd that's beating him up

358
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:16,191
It's just a couple people who like

359
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,215
Come on man

360
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,287
I'm not even really pushing him

361
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,567
And you just like

362
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:26,943
It's you the worst doing he's doing everything possible to try it inside something

363
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:32,319
Thing that probably wouldn't happen he was doing things too

364
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:35,391
Rig the appearances to make it look like he was being rude

365
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:41,791
Christmas

366
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:48,447
I want to nobody's nobody's arresting him I wanted to have if I were there I wouldn't want him there

367
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:54,335
Literally every possible situation

368
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:57,151
Even if he's the one

369
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,687
Wherever

370
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:00,735
Susan Wright story

371
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:02,271
According to Alex

372
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:04,575
Knock you the first world

373
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:08,159
The context of it is

374
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:09,183
Completely meaning

375
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:14,047
She was the National Security advisor so we do have a confirmation

376
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,095
That he did tell the

377
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:26,591
He said some troops and then lied about the interpretation of them

378
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:27,871
Which makes it a lot

379
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:30,175
Yeah or maybe he's just an idiot

380
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:34,527
Pull up because I could say hey you're wearing a boot like a green blue hoodie

381
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:35,551
That mean

382
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,575
Bayview

383
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:37,855
Are coward

384
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:42,719
I don't know. My brain wasn't doing good with her coming up with ideas

385
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:49,375
My point is that I did color of your hoodie is true but my interpretation of it is wrong

386
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,655
And therefore it's

387
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:53,215
Unless I actually am

388
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:55,007
Still have nothing to do with your hoodie

389
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:58,591
Okay that's actually how coward signal

390
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:04,991
Communicate

391
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:09,087
Handkerchief game where the coward

392
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,111
Israel is what

393
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:12,927
The point is

394
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:15,487
They make crnkovich is not telling us

395
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:16,767
Coerced

396
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:19,071
Jason Google

397
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,863
Let's finish up this equipment

398
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:27,519
I would like another drink

399
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:29,823
How many

400
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,479
The other fake journalist

401
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:40,575
Last night we posted it like 11 at 9

402
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:46,975
4 hours of research over all the emails a documents TuneIn whole manuals and a sensor when we published repay

403
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:47,743
Stages of it

404
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:53,631
So

405
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:56,191
Now it's time to get into what's actually going on

406
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:58,751
3 pages

407
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:01,823
Went through thousands

408
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:04,127
And at 11

409
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:05,151
After a long walk

410
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:07,455
I just Coleman through

411
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:09,247
These high-level

412
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:11,295
Alright

413
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:13,855
I simply sent them a link

414
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:18,208
Google given to Mike cernovich

415
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:19,488
They weren't

416
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:21,536
Why would you secretly give anything

417
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:25,120
You could just give them to Mike's

418
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:27,424
Are public documents

419
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:30,752
Bouye

420
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:37,920
They've been delisted from Google I don't know how to Google things they haven't been delisted from goo

421
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:44,576
Yeah but you don't know that you haven't searched I have what's the first thing that comes up

422
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:47,648
Kingsbury Ave 300

423
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:50,208
What is this okay I have the actual number

424
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:54,560
341,000

425
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,608
Pages

426
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,912
On Infowars listed

427
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,192
On Google

428
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:02,752
341,000 result

429
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:04,032
Yeah

430
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:07,360
You search within the site infowars.com

431
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,224
So you go into Google and you put into the Google

432
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:12,992
Search bar

433
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,296
Site colon infowars.com

434
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:17,600
You get 341,000

435
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:24,000
Results about that did you get some high-level sources who taught you how to Google Google

436
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:25,792
I don't know

437
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:31,680
So now this inside information Google works

438
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:33,472
That is a good question

439
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:34,752
It's not

440
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:36,032
Magical robots

441
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:41,920
Their algorithms work because they have these 10,000

442
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:42,944
Contractors

443
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,968
Empire

444
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:47,552
Their job is to do searches all day

445
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:49,600
Evaluate the results

446
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:52,160
Do you search for certain terms

447
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:56,000
And then there is a like 160 page

448
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:57,536
Guideline

449
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:58,560
Manual

450
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:01,120
The teaches you how to evaluate

451
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,656
The results that you get

452
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:05,472
And one of the things that they are

453
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:12,896
160

454
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:15,456
100 a comb through 160

455
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:18,016
And they found a couple pages

456
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:18,784
Kind of

457
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,576
Look bad for them

458
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:22,880
That's basically what they what was happened

459
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:25,184
Treating it like some big leak

460
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:27,232
It's come from a secret source

461
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,000
It's not

462
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:30,048
It's Google's manual for how they

463
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:31,328
Do you know

464
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,864
Tryon weed out s***

465
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:36,448
Cuz if you're searching for something you don't want to get a site that has

466
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,472
Tons of

467
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:38,496
Pop-up sauna

468
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:42,080
Redirect you somewhere where you're not supposed to be

469
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:47,200
Link that takes you somewhere that doesn't have any information

470
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,392
This

471
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:56,928
Whole thing

472
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,512
This entire manual is essentially

473
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:04,608
A training manual that goes to explain basically

474
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,168
Their guidelines

475
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:10,752
Go down to

476
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:12,544
Basically

477
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,592
It does its person have expertise

478
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:16,640
Is there a cure

479
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:18,176
And is this

480
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:26,624
Is to make sure that you and I never actually go to the second

481
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,392
Can page of Google

482
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:31,488
Yeah if you go to the second

483
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:32,512
Can page of Google

484
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:33,536
Their algorithm

485
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:36,352
Probably didn't

486
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:41,216
Baby questions Pacifica

487
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:43,008
Their job is to make you lazy

488
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:48,384
Facilitate already ingrown leg

489
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,432
Or in his time goes on

490
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:52,224
Things become less relevant

491
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:58,368
Like one of the examples examples I saw here was that like

492
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:00,672
I really got to stop paying for

493
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:01,440
The URL on

494
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:11,168
So one of these a lifetime here of something that was considered like a low-quality

495
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:16,288
By their stickers was an article about Britney Spears filing for divorce

496
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:20,384
And the reason is because the person searched for Britney Spears

497
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,480
Specifically and that page pops up

498
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:28,320
No it's because that was that's years and years older he

499
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:30,112
It can be a jerk

500
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:31,904
Britney Spears

501
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:38,304
That is yes but do you understand this isn't relevant nowadays to someone just searching for

502
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,888
What's considered low

503
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:45,472
Immediately when you search for

504
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:46,240
Just Brittany

505
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:48,800
That's not trying to delist

506
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:49,824
TMZ

507
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:55,200
As it were it's not it's just considering what are you searching for

508
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:56,992
You want to make sure that you get to that

509
00:25:57,248 --> 00:26:00,320
Yes it's trying to it's trying to suss out

510
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:01,600
Your your goals

511
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:02,624
Yeah

512
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,904
It gets a little bit,

513
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:11,584
7000 people all working on the same thing might get a little complicated with 160-page guideline with

514
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,376
Which I tried to follow

515
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:14,144
Okay

516
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:18,240
Like

517
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:20,288
Like the one page manual is just like

518
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:23,104
You know what you're looking for

519
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,128
Pittsburgh

520
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:30,016
There was a screenshot that was like this posted on crnkovich has website

521
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:32,576
Infowars reposted that was

522
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:36,416
Using Infowars as an example of something that would get a low score

523
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:37,440
Okay

524
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:38,976
This was not

525
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:40,512
From Google

526
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:41,536
Phone

527
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:43,072
Like main document

528
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:46,144
It was from one of the businesses

529
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,936
Some of these 10,000 people

530
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:49,728
Because they subcontract

531
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:50,496
These things out

532
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:54,848
How many person was using Infowars as an example of would be low

533
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:56,128
On the scale

534
00:26:56,384 --> 00:27:01,760
Presentation to essentially

535
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:03,552
Scott and the reasons that are given

536
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,392
Has been

537
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:08,672
That their overall

538
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:11,488
Controversial and often third claims are debunk

539
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:12,768
Just fair

540
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,584
We've Illustrated this over and over

541
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:17,632
But it's

542
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:19,424
There's a quote from

543
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,984
This write-up about the situation

544
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,056
Despite the page

545
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:27,616
Infowars the lowest possible score

546
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:28,384
In fact

547
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,176
Explain why this should not happen

548
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:32,224
It even defended the reason why

549
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,552
That particular page would be useful to some Google searches

550
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,344
Citizens from the

551
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,368
The documents

552
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:44,768
Simply presenting an unorthodox perspective on the news doesn't exactly qualify even if it may be harmful in the larger more

553
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,584
You could say

554
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:53,984
That we're being generous with the upper range here but the site may be considered as looking for an alternative

555
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:54,752
Information

556
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,544
And it redeems that in some way

557
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:57,824
Okay

558
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,920
Translates to

559
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:06,272
Just because it's controversial and probably not

560
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:10,112
Useful and it's coming from a thoroughly debunked

561
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,648
Isn't enough

562
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:18,304
To delisted or to drop it as low as possible what it what you should do is

563
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,608
Is if you're if you're searching for just like

564
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:27,520
What happened today Infowars should not be on the top of the list

565
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:30,080
The New York Times

566
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:31,616
If a site

567
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:38,016
Like look a sight that has reference

568
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:40,576
Navigate

569
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:42,112
Pop-ups

570
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:43,648
What you be at the lowest

571
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:44,928
When you have

572
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:46,720
Shades of the rest of it

573
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:49,024
Fifty Shades of Black

574
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:50,560
Flames

575
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:52,096
These people were

576
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:54,400
Told the 10,000

577
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:57,472
To censor Indie list Infowars

578
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:58,752
And that is

579
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:00,288
Absolutely not true

580
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:01,056
Surgeon

581
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:04,896
No they were used as an example of something I was low-quality

582
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:05,920
Witches fire

583
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:06,944
Snaptube we have the

584
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,736
Recordings of those conversations

585
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:12,576
So they put up the training montage

586
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:13,856
Alright

587
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:14,624
But

588
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,440
Say they turn the recording off I assume I'll training set

589
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:18,464
Veterans are recorded

590
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:19,488
Nixon White House

591
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:21,536
They turn it off

592
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:22,816
And then the trainer ghost

593
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:23,840
Listen

594
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:25,632
This is off the Record

595
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:29,728
Infowars

596
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:30,752
Cuz those Fox

597
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:33,824
Is b*******

598
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,592
The thing

599
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:36,640
Here's where it gets even more,

600
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:38,176
Okay

601
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:40,224
Example that the used

602
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:45,344
In this sort of guideline that was using Infowars as an example

603
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,952
A low-quality information Source they used to screenshot

604
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:52,512
Article

605
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:53,280
Assad

606
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:56,096
Reporting that

607
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:58,144
The gas attack was fake

608
00:29:59,168 --> 00:29:59,680
Okay

609
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:02,752
Later

610
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:03,776
Because he's like

611
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:06,080
They're saying we don't have legitimate sources

612
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:09,152
Ron Paul Ron Paul was on Artis

613
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,688
Putin said

614
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,856
This credible sources

615
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:25,024
No I'm scared of the former UK Ambassador who has a history of supporting Assad through

616
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,072
Right really murky

617
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:30,656
These are his sources

618
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:31,424
And he doesn't

619
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:35,776
I think he knows but he's not willing to engage with the idea of it like

620
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:37,312
These are bad sources

621
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:40,896
These are bad sources

622
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:44,736
What are the only sources Who would know

623
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:46,784
Because they're the ones

624
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:51,904
The story is

625
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:58,304
That aside gases on people

626
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,840
Assad take on it

627
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:04,704
Like I know every time someone's accused of murder they don't say they did it

628
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:05,728
Pretty much

629
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:13,408
Yeah okay find some terrorist organization.

630
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:16,480
Guilty immediately

631
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:20,320
Everybody knew

632
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,000
Here's my ears my phone

633
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:31,328
Here's my fun theory about Assad like

634
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:32,864
How great would it be

635
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:33,632
If he

636
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:34,656
Do it

637
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:38,240
But he knows nobody would ever believe him like

638
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:39,008
Like what

639
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,800
Bummer for him

640
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:43,104
Like the one time he's not the most

641
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,664
Evil son-of-a-b**** brighter

642
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:47,968
All of the sudden he's like

643
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:51,040
The boy who cried I didn't do it

644
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:55,136
Do it

645
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:57,184
People just just to get over it

646
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:00,512
I wouldn't be surprised

647
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:02,816
Example

648
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:09,216
Even within that example it wasn't saying delist or sent to them at all it was used

649
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:15,616
Get a loan

650
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:18,432
The person who's going to turn that into a huge f****** deal

651
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:22,528
Use another example that's what I would have advised

652
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,808
I was a messed up

653
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:27,904
Any number of examples

654
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:33,280
Yeah

655
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,584
I don't know cernovich

656
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:41,472
Stay away from those guys in your fine they're the ones we're going to get really mad

657
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,544
These work get the extra

658
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:49,152
What Alex Jones is responding to on this episode that we're listening to

659
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,712
Is the Google put out of state

660
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,248
Explaining

661
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,272
That

662
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:55,808
They didn't

663
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,600
Make that manual

664
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:58,880
The second manual

665
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:05,280
That has Infowars used as an example

666
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:08,608
Absolutely but they addressed in there like Halo

667
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:11,680
They didn't they were telling anybody to censor anything

668
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:12,448
But

669
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:15,520
They did use them as an example I understand how

670
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:19,616
This could come off so we've asked

671
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:21,408
So that's what Google has

672
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:26,784
No I mean you're making a scrunchy face but I get where they're coming from too so alright let's

673
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:27,552
Just f******

674
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:28,576
Squash this

675
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:30,624
I'm a bit but Alex of course

676
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:38,560
Who's the co-host of an Alex Jones podcast

677
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:44,192
Offhand throw away

678
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:46,496
Because just the fact that they're responding

679
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:49,824
We're at best

680
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,360
If he's coming after us

681
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:52,128
Facepunch

682
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:54,176
Right now

683
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:56,736
Probably at least for now

684
00:33:57,248 --> 00:34:03,392
Google Google gets to be a giant corporation that you can really real again

685
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:04,160
Because there's

686
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:05,952
No way Infowars

687
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:07,232
Subscribers and listeners

688
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:10,560
Really think that Google isn't part of the global

689
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:16,192
I think that Google is so the very fact that Google is responding

690
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:17,728
To that means like

691
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:19,264
Do they know where powerful

692
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:21,824
You know we have something on them

693
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,616
They know they're caught this

694
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:25,664
Alex is going to get to that but

695
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:32,320
You you're starting to be able to predict his behavior

696
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:38,464
Two things one I think the Google probably doesn't understand his listeners as well as we do

697
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:41,024
Listeners understanding

698
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:46,400
Maybe night cuz I think they're doing exactly what I would do in there

699
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,472
Which is be like what we didn't make that

700
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:50,496
Fair enough

701
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:51,520
Fair enough

702
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:56,640
Let's try and clean up our mess a little bit

703
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:01,760
That I don't even apologize

704
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,552
Apologize

705
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:09,952
Absolutely not another Susan Rice store

706
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,256
It's all

707
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:15,328
Non facts presented as conspiracy against them

708
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:17,376
Do highlight victims

709
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:20,192
To do with the divorce

710
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:22,496
Not under a gag order

711
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:23,520
He is the victor

712
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:24,544
Which is

713
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,592
Which is the only

714
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,640
Real bullet

715
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:29,920
Conservative movement

716
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:30,688
Has

717
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:32,992
Is that they're always the ones under

718
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:39,136
That's there that's there all that always there argument when it always comes back to it which is why they can

719
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:40,416
Actually do anything

720
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:44,000
Like I'd like now that they're in power

721
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:46,816
They can actually govern in any kind of reasonable

722
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:49,376
What what do you do

723
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:53,728
Like you're always the victim now you're the one who's

724
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:55,264
Victimizing other people

725
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,336
And whenever everybody starts

726
00:35:58,592 --> 00:35:59,104
F****** up

727
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,152
Now the GOP is

728
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:02,688
Complaining that their the victim

729
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:09,088
Against the GOP like they just don't have any other Playbook to find the freedom caucus has to become

730
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:15,488
Campbell wants her being victimized are the mainstream or Bannon being victimized

731
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:20,096
Later there's going to be whenever everybody has

732
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:22,912
To claim to be the victim of a man is already happening

733
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:26,752
Boggles my mind considering the fact that their other argument is that

734
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:28,288
Everybody else is

735
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:29,056
Playing the Vic

736
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,080
Now

737
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:32,896
We're going to move on I think that

738
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:36,736
Fairly decently address the Google thing I'll post links

739
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:40,832
Almost links to stuff on the couch, you can find

740
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:43,136
Some resources on that b explain

741
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:48,000
Really what's going on is b******* Alex

742
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:48,768
Goes on

743
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,584
From the main point you going to come back to it

744
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,376
I just remember whenever he does

745
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:54,656
It's horseshit

746
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:55,680
But

747
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:56,448
This clip

748
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:58,240
And the next couple clips

749
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:01,312
Hair

750
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:06,176
Piece of Google

751
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:11,296
The censoring him in the news articles about Syria being a false flag attack

752
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:13,088
It was all admit it

753
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,112
Today

754
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:21,280
What the media attack on us only intensifies from there I mean it is just getting so crazy

755
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:23,840
To understand that the Infowars has been chosen

756
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:25,632
As the beta test

757
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:28,448
Incrementally basically shutdown

758
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:31,776
And that's why they took things I said out of context

759
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:36,128
Contacts

760
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,200
And then they pulled him out and

761
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:48,416
Again targeting low-information readers

762
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:52,768
So this is

763
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:54,304
Because

764
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:58,144
It's not all

765
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:02,496
That's why you shouldn't be saying that Xavier

766
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:03,264
No

767
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,848
Not during this trial gag order

768
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:11,200
He actually did get in trouble in court

769
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:12,992
On Tuesday because

770
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:14,272
He made a video like this

771
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:16,832
I don't know if it's this video specifically

772
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:19,904
But he's not supposed to be talking about any of this stuff

773
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,440
Technically

774
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:22,208
She's not

775
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:23,232
Addressing

776
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:25,792
Directly but he is basically addressing

777
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:26,560
Sing the fact that he

778
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:28,096
He said he was an act

779
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:30,656
Yeah alright least his lawyer said that he was in

780
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:32,704
And then claiming that

781
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,496
They're saying that he's

782
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:35,520
Haha

783
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,080
He's distinction

784
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:39,360
Is that

785
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:43,968
He's going to fully flesh this out

786
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:45,248
What are you going to attempt

787
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:46,528
Hopefully flesh this out

788
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:48,832
And his argument that he's going to lay out

789
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:50,368
Is but there were times

790
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,160
When he plays characters

791
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:54,208
Like one time he was in con makeup

792
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:02,912
Character

793
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:05,216
And I alternative

794
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:09,824
The guy who wears a lizard bad sometime sometime

795
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:13,152
He makes the argument

796
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:15,456
Those times he's doing parody

797
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:16,992
But all the other times

798
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:17,760
He's real

799
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:19,040
So now this is America

800
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:19,808
Because

801
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:20,832
He's

802
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:21,600
To use

803
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:22,880
Lee performance art

804
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:23,904
Flame

805
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,208
In the past

806
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,000
Or with him screaming

807
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,608
Which is not what are you talking about now

808
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:35,424
He specifically in this episode

809
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,960
That everyone who thinks

810
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:39,520
Playing the role in

811
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:43,360
He thinks that they're just talking about the times that he puts on a lizard man

812
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:44,896
Or does a British accent

813
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:46,176
Or stuff like that

814
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:50,016
He is so confused about what people are actually saying about

815
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:52,064
It's

816
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:53,088
Insane

817
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,416
I could have called almost all of these clips

818
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:57,440
Alex is illiterate

819
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:58,464
Because

820
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:02,816
OK Google

821
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:08,960
He goes on to say

822
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,224
To say some more stuff about how he is not

823
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:21,248
An actor

824
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:22,784
Again

825
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,320
This could have really hurt him in court

826
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:25,600
Defense

827
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:29,952
It's really going to work against them I really think of some of this might get played in court

828
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:30,720
Cuz it's

829
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:31,488
Overt

830
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:33,280
Pretty hilarious

831
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:35,072
He's a man

832
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:36,096
Self-destruct

833
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:37,888
Time

834
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,680
Doing satire

835
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:40,960
Alright well that's

836
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:44,544
When I tell you what I wear has or mask

837
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:55,296
Emily's whatever took off

838
00:40:55,808 --> 00:41:00,672
As a joke everybody else does jokes

839
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:02,464
President's two jobs

840
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:08,864
I was being an actor there that was satar I believe in

841
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:14,752
Not selling out everywhere

842
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,568
And there are literally in the last two days over

843
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:19,360
Google Alerts

844
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:23,968
12:00 article

845
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,784
With the words Alex Jones admits he's fake

846
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:30,112
Alex Jones says he's just an actor it doesn't believe it

847
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:32,672
Yeah you did

848
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:34,464
No he didn't

849
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:35,744
His lawyer.

850
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,512
Yeah

851
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:38,304
And it is an important distinction

852
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:42,912
I don't know of any lawyers who are like

853
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,960
Here's what I want my client

854
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:49,312
Goodnight what I said

855
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:58,271
I don't know a lot of lawyers if you're a lawyer for like

856
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:02,367
You don't want to be like your honor

857
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:04,159
We enter a plea of not guilty

858
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:07,743
Your

859
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:09,279
Go on TV being like

860
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:14,655
I didn't kill people

861
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:24,895
You know what the only way I can sort of wrap my brain around it is like the strategy

862
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:27,711
Legal strategy of the water

863
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:29,503
Like make it

864
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:30,271
Really

865
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:31,039
So on

866
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:32,063
The tangle ball

867
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:34,879
Like just a big not like your headphones are off

868
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:38,207
All wrapped up you're never going to get those

869
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:39,487
Discord right here

870
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:41,791
Yeah that's

871
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:48,191
So yeah I think that's possible

872
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:52,287
But

873
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:56,639
This goes on again this is very ill-advised on a part

874
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:58,943
Here's the fun thing that I always

875
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:01,759
Conservative

876
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:03,295
Don't understand

877
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:06,623
They're not no no no

878
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:08,415
So his idea of life

879
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:11,231
Everybody else does.

880
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:12,767
I know

881
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:13,791
I know

882
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:15,071
But

883
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:16,351
But you're like

884
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:17,375
Like what

885
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:18,655
What's this

886
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:21,983
She is trying to be funny on Twitter and you're like

887
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:24,031
Wow

888
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:25,311
Cut it out

889
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:26,847
Stick to the base

890
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:29,151
You know what's really funny

891
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:30,431
White people are the best

892
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:33,503
Oh no that's not really a joke

893
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:36,063
Stuff

894
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:37,087
Yeah

895
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:40,671
You're right he doesn't understand if this is the problem

896
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:42,719
He's not really doing satire

897
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:45,023
Freeze totally right about people taking them out of context

898
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:46,559
Admittedly

899
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:49,631
If he was at like an open mic

900
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:51,423
And what on stage

901
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:52,959
Wearing a lizard mask

902
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:56,031
And just saying Alex Jones

903
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:56,799
That would be the fun

904
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:02,175
He was doing like the my mom kicked me off her knee

905
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:08,575
Does four ways to learn

906
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:09,343
So long as he

907
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:15,999
Isn't trying to tell a joke to be fair we seen nothing like our third episode

908
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:25,471
I never said a word of that list what the media does is clips of me when I really do

909
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:32,127
Like Stephen Colbert

910
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:35,711
Nickelback Rockstar

911
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:38,015
Cuz I know

912
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:44,415
OK Google

913
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:53,887
That's me going

914
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:00,543
Employees

915
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:03,103
Thrown out of the rent house

916
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:12,575
Bleachers

917
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:16,927
Classic

918
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:19,743
It just so crazy as a real classical liberal

919
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:23,839
Alex Azar

920
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:24,607
A class

921
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:33,055
Cuz he just thought he was that also

922
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:35,103
Desert lizard

923
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:39,455
Freedom openness and anti-drug War

924
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:42,015
That's all the criteria that he gave there

925
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:44,063
That's a classical liberal

926
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:45,087
II

927
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:45,855
You know

928
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:50,207
I I I don't want to say that I'm

929
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:56,095
Were there where their movements in Classical liberalism

930
00:45:57,631 --> 00:45:59,679
Liberals that I would not say are very open

931
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:04,031
Liberalism

932
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:10,175
Hey your reserve get out of here

933
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:16,831
I don't know if I've ever called it that before Victorian London

934
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:17,855
Maybe

935
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:22,207
Even in his explanation

936
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:26,815
You're not on the lease

937
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:28,863
Your roommate is

938
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:30,911
Which means you should be there

939
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:33,215
That might be more what's going on

940
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:35,263
Oh really it might be

941
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:41,663
The whole the whole you should be on that like it's 5 can sublet your apartment it's against the law

942
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:44,735
I mean if you don't get your land

943
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:52,159
Often times our to accidentally tell the truth in the middle of a bulshit sense

944
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:57,535
You got to get out of here I hate

945
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:58,559
You're not on the lease

946
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:02,911
You don't have that it's the 28th in the

947
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:07,519
Google is trying to delist us

948
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:08,287
They're not

949
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:14,687
The story that you posted even the Business Insider story doesn't even say that

950
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:15,455
Call the lawyer

951
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:19,295
Of course you too busy with his other lawyers

952
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:26,463
Maybe he did call already been calling his lawyer

953
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:29,791
Divorce lawyer about suing the biggest company in the world

954
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:32,607
They're not quite the baseball field

955
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:36,959
My man there up there anyway

956
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:42,591
This is not just full of anecdotal stories about people getting kicked out of their home

957
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:46,175
It's not just the guy who's going to falsely claiming the classical liberal

958
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:50,015
He's also going to tell you a story about someone talking to him

959
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:55,647
Just sit here and watch all these a whole lie about me constantly and then I got the street

960
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:56,415
Today

961
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:57,695
Today

962
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:59,231
Walk up to me and say

963
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:01,535
I'd really like you I was no time and I

964
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:04,863
I saw you on the news

965
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:09,471
It's all fake

966
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:12,287
I said hundreds of times on my own shows people asking

967
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:18,687
SMS, is it real

968
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:22,783
Goddamn hell I don't know and the other question is

969
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:24,319
Is it for real

970
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:28,415
Found money or sovereignty

971
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:29,439
Family

972
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:33,535
For free open-market free-market systems or not having

973
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:44,287
Yikes oh you should not be already lost the customer

974
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:45,055
Done

975
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:49,151
Notary kids are vaccinated

976
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:55,295
Tickets for kids

977
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:01,951
How many times does Seth has on the podcast

978
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:05,535
Little kids are f****** s*** public

979
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:06,303
Help

980
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:07,327
It's not

981
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:13,727
Science is still out

982
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:17,055
Vaccines are tainted

983
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:18,079
Oh man

984
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:20,383
I don't say this lightly

985
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:23,967
One of his kitchen

986
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:27,295
I don't say this lightly

987
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:28,575
That guy on the street didn't

988
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:34,463
Iusedtolikeyou I've been yesterday

989
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:36,255
I saw a report that you're fake

990
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:40,351
Oh that that ruined all the time but I look

991
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:44,191
Did he hallucinate

992
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:46,751
It's possible sounds very

993
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:48,799
He's very sincere in that story

994
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:50,847
Like it doesn't sound like he's lying

995
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:53,663
In the same way that usually does whenever he lies where

996
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:55,455
Are you put into many details like

997
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:59,807
Diana Paisley

998
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:06,207
He does often give too many details but this was like all these narratives to he just flippantly lies and say

999
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:09,535
Sounds like he believes all the time

1000
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:13,375
Demoralize

1001
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:15,679
This clip is super bizarre

1002
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:17,471
Little I'm excited

1003
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:19,775
Starts with him saying stuff

1004
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:23,359
Obliquely referring to the court case

1005
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:24,383
You shouldn't be saying

1006
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:25,407
Jimmy's Egg

1007
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:29,759
Many speculate as to why people are attacking Infowars

1008
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:31,039
Are you lying

1009
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:32,063
It's all bulshit

1010
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:33,343
Then

1011
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:34,623
He transitions

1012
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:36,927
Into Ally

1013
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:39,487
About callers calling into his show

1014
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:41,023
And then

1015
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:44,607
He tries to explain satire

1016
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:47,679
Deepwater that

1017
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:50,751
That's like the strawman explanation he does not

1018
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:55,615
Way I would stop it up is that tires f****** hard

1019
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:56,639
It's real hard

1020
00:50:56,895 --> 00:50:58,175
To be like the pros

1021
00:50:58,687 --> 00:51:00,223
Give it a shot Alex

1022
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:07,391
Personal life of the system coming

1023
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:09,183
Imma take the high road

1024
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:13,791
I've done everything I said I do

1025
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:19,679
I'm at left or right I choose issues what are they

1026
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:26,079
Self people

1027
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:32,479
Because that's the New Media Center like Alex is Bonafide he's real people believe him it's spreading

1028
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:34,527
Skipper Bud's always other Freedom Motors

1029
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:39,647
So that who is saying that will that's what he's saying that that's why people attack

1030
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:42,207
Cuz he's almost Vanguard of the New Freedom

1031
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:50,399
But before that he was saying that like my you know all the stuff I'm under attack about my family I'm going to take the high road on it

1032
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:51,423
Merced s***

1033
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:52,447
You should have said

1034
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:53,215
Nothing

1035
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:55,519
Even just saying that

1036
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:56,799
Is going to be a problem

1037
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:57,823
Alex Jones

1038
00:51:58,591 --> 00:51:59,615
You should have said nothing

1039
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:02,687
Let's that should be his biography

1040
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:07,295
Mike Birbiglia jokes

1041
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:09,855
What I should have said was nothing

1042
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:14,975
Was all the s*** my lawyer told me that too

1043
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:18,815
That they can track that most of the modern

1044
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:23,167
Next wave of a patriotic libertarian

1045
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:25,215
Heaven

1046
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:27,519
Call Mike drudge helped us launch some

1047
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:29,823
Would watch all around Audrey

1048
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:34,175
Killer

1049
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:38,271
Well Infowars has been a big magnifier

1050
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:45,183
As well for other people and they see that they know we're like an incubation system for other people

1051
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:54,911
Now we take that as an argument we can look at the people who have come out of Infowars and game

1052
00:52:55,935 --> 00:52:58,751
National prominence and I can count on

1053
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:00,287
0 hands

1054
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:03,615
The number of people who have come out of Infowars and

1055
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:04,895
Become relevant

1056
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:08,479
0 hands

1057
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:11,807
Sure I read a New York Times profile

1058
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:16,159
Oh no no no dude there was a rainbow snatch

1059
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:19,231
No that was on it for work

1060
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:26,399
All the people that he has on you could make an argument are

1061
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:29,215
Like people who give him more credibility

1062
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:32,031
People like Anthony cumia be hosting

1063
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:33,055
Wants

1064
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:38,175
Two weeks once every two weeks or whatever people like Gavin McGinnis, gone even like cernovich

1065
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:40,479
Yeah but these are guys who have built in

1066
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:41,759
Fan groups already

1067
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:43,039
Don't mean anything

1068
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:44,575
Route 20

1069
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:47,135
Owen Shroyer doing nothing

1070
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:49,695
Paul Joseph Watson has a big fan base

1071
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:51,999
Keep the Infowars is a

1072
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:53,279
Anchor around his leg

1073
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:55,583
For all intensive purposes

1074
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:57,631
He just makes short attention span

1075
00:53:57,887 --> 00:54:01,215
Propaganda videos that he puts out on his own channel

1076
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:07,103
They're terrible she is someone who is actually fairly successful

1077
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:08,639
Homegrown

1078
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:09,663
Or whatever

1079
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:11,199
She lives in London

1080
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:12,479
He doesn't he

1081
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:16,831
He's as separate from Alex's he can be while still being involved

1082
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:18,367
David Knight sucks

1083
00:54:18,879 --> 00:54:19,391
David Knight

1084
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:22,975
Lee Ann McAdoo hat is great but she doesn't have it

1085
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:23,743

00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:40,639
Evan bring her over here

1091
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:43,967
Ritz

00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:48,575
That would be so great

1093
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:52,159
Millie Weaver sucks

1094
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:53,439
Bubba Bubba

1095
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:54,207
Kabob

1096
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:56,255
Ashley Beckford barely ever around

1097
00:54:56,511 --> 00:55:02,655
Around aren't around anymore Jakari Jackson

1098
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:04,703
Certainly isn't the notable

1099
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:05,727
Household name

1100
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:07,775
Rambo Joe Biggs

00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:11,103
He's not around don't like you

1102
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:13,919
Mark Dice

1103
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:15,455
Not super famous

1104
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:20,063
I really big name unless he's secretly

1105
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:21,343
Andrew Dice Clay

1106
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:22,367
Wearing a mask

Benjamin Button

1111
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:32,095
John bowne

1112
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:33,119
Isn't famous

1113
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:36,959
None of these people are notable do you just have a team of losers

1114
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:39,263
No

1115
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:43,103
Will you

1116
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:46,943
If any of them were doing their own thing they might actually be successful

1117
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:48,991
They might have it in them to do something

1118
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:51,807
No it's possible I don't know

1119
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:52,575
It is past

1120
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:55,391
I've no idea I've never seen universe

1121
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:58,207
Yes in one section of the Multiverse

1122
00:55:58,719 --> 00:55:59,743
Paul Joseph Watson

1123
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:01,279
Is the greatest brunch

1124
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:05,119
I sincerely think he probably has way more Talent than

1125
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:06,143
Keys

1126
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:08,191
Expressing through his propaganda video

1127
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:09,727
Yeah probably

1128
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:14,079
That's fair

1129
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:20,479
I'm talking about all the other dingdong like they don't even have a chance to shine in their own

1130
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:22,527
Anything they're just hour to second

1131
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:26,367
Even save the exact same things that he does

1132
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:27,647
They just biggest

1133
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:31,231
The tarantula the strangest thing about his argue

1134
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:32,255
Is that

1135
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:34,047
He is essentially

1136
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:34,815
A cult leader

1137
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:36,607
Anyone

1138
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:37,375
Threatening

1139
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:38,143
His

1140
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:39,935
Consolidation

1141
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:41,471
Mediately torn down

1142
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:47,615
Or at least sent to the side for a little bit

1143
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:54,271
For a little while then just brought back in

1144
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:57,343
Anyway

1145
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:05,023
Truth is my northstars my Polestar

1146
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:06,815
It's what I want it's where I'm going

1147
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:10,143
Nope all the time I get to call you

1148
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:11,423
Getting regular listener

1149
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:13,983
Call

1150
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:15,775
Are you for real

1151
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:19,359
I've listened to every day for the last 4 months

1152
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:21,151
Has anybody said not one

1153
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:23,455
Not what nobody's ever asked about

1154
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:24,735
He does screen his calls

1155
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:26,015
Sure

1156
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:28,063
So

1157
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:29,343
It's entirely possible

1158
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:31,135
That is screener is heard that

1159
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:38,047
But he said that anyone who listens

1160
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:45,727
Relate that information to anyone who listens would know that

1161
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:47,775
This call happens all the time

1162
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:48,799
I live in Dublin

1163
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:56,479
Absolutely

1164
00:57:56,735 --> 00:57:59,295
If I dress up like The Joker

1165
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:05,695
50,000 YouTube followers find it.

1166
00:58:06,975 --> 00:58:09,279
I was being an actor there illustrating

1167
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:14,655
Evil clowns going take your vaccine schedule a showing articles

1168
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:19,007
Evil clown

1169
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:22,335
You know what

1170
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:24,639
This is acting

1171
00:58:39,487 --> 00:58:41,023
No I don't mean take up

1172
00:58:41,279 --> 00:58:42,815
And no I'm not really

1173
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:44,351
But I am

1174
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:47,423
Good expression when I believe so I put

1175
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:52,287
People

1176
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:56,383
Show me pictures send it

1177
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:58,431
He's acting 2X

1178
00:58:58,687 --> 00:58:59,967
Express Woody really believe

1179
00:59:00,479 --> 00:59:00,991
Yeah

1180
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:03,807
Well no I mean what are you saying

1181
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:10,207
Is that he plays this character as the opposite of what he believes in order to make the point

1182
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:12,767
Right in the queso

1183
00:59:13,023 --> 00:59:13,791
He is a performer

1184
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:17,631
That he

1185
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:19,935
5% of the time

1186
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:20,959
Is act

1187
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:22,751
And he is only Act

1188
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:28,895
To express Woody actually believe which is the opposite

1189
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:35,295
So bad crystal clear

1190
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:40,415
He's not abstractly talkin about

1191
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:48,095
Other times it might have been performance art when he was screaming at some guy or something like that

1192
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:49,887
About times he's worn costumes

1193
00:59:50,911 --> 00:59:51,935
That's important

1194
00:59:55,263 --> 00:59:57,567
But also

1195
00:59:57,823 --> 01:00:00,895
It's not a good argument against vaccines they have liability for

1196
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:02,175
It's a very bad

1197
01:00:02,431 --> 01:00:03,967
Because almost everything

1198
01:00:06,015 --> 01:00:08,575
Check the inserts

1199
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:11,903
Yeah well the reason that your your aspirin

1200
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:13,183
Has a f****** little

1201
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:15,487
Cover because of the

1202
01:00:15,743 --> 01:00:17,791
You aspirin murderer

1203
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:20,095
Maybe that was not

1204
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:26,751
Videos of the guy could have been the actual Corporation

1205
01:00:27,007 --> 01:00:27,775
Section

1206
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:31,615
Almost everything is use at your own risk

1207
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:34,175
We were walking away from this

1208
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:36,991
We don't want liability how come we haven't

1209
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:38,271
A disclaimer at the

1210
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:42,111
What are we doing

1211
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:46,975
I'll stand by my words anyway

1212
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:51,583
Alarm for 1 question

1213
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:54,143
There's so many

1214
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:56,191
I didn't know dress up as a joke

1215
01:00:57,727 --> 01:01:03,871
1000followers cuz he dressed up as a

1216
01:01:08,479 --> 01:01:09,247
Zucchini

1217
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:10,271
Does he believe

1218
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:12,831
That his listeners

1219
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:14,879
Are so dumb

1220
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:20,255
That were they to see him

1221
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:22,303
He is the Joker

1222
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:28,703
We're going to get into a clip a little bit later down the road where he wrestles with this a little bit further

1223
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:34,335
I think he's disappointed by how dumb his listeners are

1224
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:37,151
He knows that if he calls them dumb

1225
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:38,431
Game over

1226
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:40,735
Yeah so he has to try and

1227
01:01:41,503 --> 01:01:44,063
Blame the media and stuff like that

1228
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:45,599
They poisoned everyone's Minds

1229
01:01:46,111 --> 01:01:50,975
An act like he's talking about other people about the Dum Dum

1230
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:54,303
His listeners saw him dressed up like The Joker and they were like

1231
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:57,631
Wow you actually believe that that means your listeners are dumb

1232
01:01:57,887 --> 01:01:58,399
Also

1233
01:01:58,911 --> 01:01:59,423
No one

1234
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:00,447
Who is

1235
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:02,239
Making fun of that clip

1236
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:04,031
Years ago when he did that

1237
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:05,311
No one was like

1238
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:10,431
Look at this guy he likes to dress up like The Joker we don't get this is parity

1239
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:11,967
We don't get this tire

1240
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:12,991
Emerald is like

1241
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:15,039
Look at this crazy assholes

1242
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:19,647
The first time

1243
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:21,951
First

1244
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:23,487
Leave my pictures of it

1245
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:24,511
He really did

1246
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:27,327
Put on like video the makeup and everything

1247
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:28,351
Who told him that

1248
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:31,423
I bet there's just people who can't tell him it's not

1249
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:38,079
That actually sounds far more listen to anybody that's why

1250
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:42,175
Himself or whatever

1251
01:02:42,431 --> 01:02:42,943
Going to get

1252
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:44,479
Fuct

1253
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:47,039
Yeah so this next clip coming up

1254
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:48,575
Is Siam

1255
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:51,647
Really further nailing down that he's not

1256
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:55,231
He also explained

1257
01:02:55,487 --> 01:02:55,999
He doesn't want to be

1258
01:02:58,047 --> 01:02:59,071
That is the least

1259
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:07,007
Truth is his Northstar engine

1260
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:10,591
With others

1261
01:03:12,127 --> 01:03:13,663
Totally but also

1262
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:15,199
Really

1263
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:17,759
Shouldn't be making a crystal clear case

1264
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:24,159
I've been in major movies

1265
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:27,999
Reality TV shows

1266
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:32,351
In the world shows with them

1267
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:37,215
I don't want that

1268
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:39,263
I don't want to be a celebrity

1269
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:42,591
I want to be a leader for freedom

1270
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:43,359
For the future

1271
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:47,711
Now

1272
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:52,831
Someone they know

1273
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:55,647
Stanford America

1274
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:58,463
If they can do that

1275
01:03:59,231 --> 01:04:01,023
Will you just got really shocked what's up

1276
01:04:01,279 --> 01:04:04,351
He just said he was under criminal investigation

1277
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:06,655
He's not

1278
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:08,703
Thinks is happening

1279
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:11,519
They're investigating the bot

1280
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:12,287
Promote

1281
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:13,055
Is content

1282
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:14,591
And stuff like that

1283
01:04:15,103 --> 01:04:18,175
The FBI has announced those at McClatchy article

1284
01:04:21,503 --> 01:04:23,295
We're discussing that these Russian Bots

1285
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:24,319
Time

1286
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:25,599
There

1287
01:04:25,855 --> 01:04:26,367
Promotion

1288
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:29,439
Infowars Breitbart content

1289
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:31,487
To make a very high impact

1290
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:35,327
Never Trump was going when something bad was happening

1291
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:39,167
It seems like all of these anti-hillary

1292
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:40,447
Pro Trump articles

1293
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:41,983
From Infowars

1294
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:44,287
We're being pushed really hard

1295
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:46,335
Identify

1296
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:48,383
Thought that were being used by Russia

1297
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:53,247
Well it's really traceable

1298
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:57,087
But they're using they're not good at

1299
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:58,879
Right that is a good strategy

1300
01:04:59,135 --> 01:05:02,463
Syria hoax hashtag

1301
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:04,767
It's really easy to track back to use the first

1302
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:05,791
Everything

1303
01:05:06,047 --> 01:05:06,815
Cuz it's the internet

1304
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:09,119
Yeah is it in the same way

1305
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:12,703
Everything what you can pretty easily identify these

1306
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:13,727
These fake accounts

1307
01:05:13,983 --> 01:05:14,751
It's pretty simple

1308
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:17,055
Hazel Alex

1309
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:20,127
That because the FBI is investigating Infowars connection

1310
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:24,223
These Bots they are investigating him being a Russian age

1311
01:05:24,735 --> 01:05:25,247
And you're not

1312
01:05:25,759 --> 01:05:31,903
Or of him making himself into a bigger victim in a bigger March

1313
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:36,767
Back if anybody

1314
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:37,535
Coward

1315
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:38,303
When you're like

1316
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:41,119
If you don't protect me they're coming for you next

1317
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:43,167
What I deserve to become

1318
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:46,495
Like I am a liar and a propaganda

1319
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:47,519
And my own

1320
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:53,919
20-year game is caught up to me now at this point

1321
01:05:54,175 --> 01:06:00,319
For buying my weirdo pills and Bones sauce

1322
01:06:00,575 --> 01:06:05,183
Vaccine

1323
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:16,703
No viral content whatsoever against fake diseases

1324
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:23,615
Mite bites

1325
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:27,711
For Doctor group would come in with some like weird fake disease

1326
01:06:31,551 --> 01:06:33,087
Yeah 25

1327
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:35,135
Anyway this is what cowards do

1328
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:41,023
You have this built up group around you going to turn on me eventually unless I make us a super tumor

1329
01:06:41,535 --> 01:06:43,071
And it is going to be super

1330
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:44,095
The cap

1331
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:45,375
I mean Hugh

1332
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:51,263
Things that he should not say it's a cult leader move to

1333
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:54,079
It's always going to be you know

1334
01:06:54,591 --> 01:06:59,711
They're coming up to me your leader because they're going to be coming after you the moment

1335
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:01,759
I'm gone I'm the only one protect

1336
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:03,551
Getting you it's an implied threat

1337
01:07:03,807 --> 01:07:06,367
Two phones

1338
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:09,439
We all have to kill ourselves or else they're going to get

1339
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:10,719
Samsung

1340
01:07:10,975 --> 01:07:15,327
Yeah it's not as it's not as certainly

1341
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:17,375
Related

1342
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:18,143
2

1343
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:19,679
Jones

1344
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:21,471
Alicia

1345
01:07:21,983 --> 01:07:24,543
Has Alex Jones ever been in San Francisco

1346
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:27,615
The people Church

1347
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:29,151
I would almost guarantee

1348
01:07:30,431 --> 01:07:32,735
This next clip is weird

1349
01:07:33,503 --> 01:07:34,271
This clip

1350
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:35,039
Is Alex

1351
01:07:35,295 --> 01:07:37,087
Not really understanding what

1352
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:38,879
Doing an act is

1353
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:42,719
He doesn't really understand it and then he gets a little bit sentimental

1354
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:46,047
He gets lost in that is not true

1355
01:07:48,095 --> 01:07:49,631
Cheerleader video on this

1356
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:55,263
Ridiculous

1357
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:02,431
Driver's license

1358
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:03,455
AR-15

1359
01:08:03,967 --> 01:08:04,735
The hardship

1360
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:07,039
Small animal vet

1361
01:08:10,111 --> 01:08:14,207
Can I pull up the Sonic and act tough for girls

1362
01:08:15,231 --> 01:08:15,999
Manchester

1363
01:08:16,511 --> 01:08:19,583
I tried that slicker than I probably was was it

1364
01:08:20,351 --> 01:08:23,423
No I really wanted to take that girl I really want to take her to the movies

1365
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:25,727
I really wanted to kiss her but my hand on her thigh

1366
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:27,519
I really wanted

1367
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:29,055
And I did

1368
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:30,847
The bad girls as well

1369
01:08:31,615 --> 01:08:37,503
Punk rock girls

1370
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:39,295
Walked over like I was tough

1371
01:08:39,551 --> 01:08:40,575
It was an act

1372
01:08:41,343 --> 01:08:41,855
My heart

1373
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:43,903
What's a hundred percent behind

1374
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:47,743
The beginning definition you want to be

1375
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:50,303
Everything we've done for the

1376
01:08:50,815 --> 01:08:52,607
Everything

1377
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:54,911
Everything

1378
01:08:58,751 --> 01:08:59,775
Product tell Reserve

1379
01:09:00,031 --> 01:09:00,799
Big Smoke

1380
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:02,079
Call system

1381
01:09:03,103 --> 01:09:04,383
Is being exposed right now

1382
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:08,479
After Victory after victory

1383
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:10,271
Pod leaders

1384
01:09:11,295 --> 01:09:12,575
You had the Japan

1385
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:17,439
Because of you

1386
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:19,743
Do have to say that a thousand times

1387
01:09:22,303 --> 01:09:24,351
Yeah I would posit also

1388
01:09:24,863 --> 01:09:25,375
That

1389
01:09:26,143 --> 01:09:27,935
When you're in the middle of an ugly divorce

1390
01:09:28,959 --> 01:09:29,471
And

1391
01:09:29,727 --> 01:09:30,495
One of your

1392
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:31,263
Arguments

1393
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:33,823
In court is that you're playing a character

1394
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:39,455
Against the wishes of your lawyer clearly you get on air and you shoot a video

1395
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:41,759
For your arguing that you are not an actor

1396
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:43,551
It might not be best

1397
01:09:44,063 --> 01:09:44,831
To talk about

1398
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:51,231
Was I acting when I f***** every girl in my school

1399
01:09:52,255 --> 01:09:53,279
Punk rock girls

1400
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:57,887
I got the cheerleaders got them out Bad Girls 2

1401
01:09:59,423 --> 01:10:01,983
Book if you talkin about

1402
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:04,799
That's my favorite Alex right there

1403
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:07,359
That's a great Alex

1404
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:09,407
I got my license at 15

1405
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:11,711
And that's what I started f******

1406
01:10:11,967 --> 01:10:12,735
Everyone

1407
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:19,647
There's there's your clip Media Matters right

1408
01:10:19,903 --> 01:10:26,047
Alex Jones a fifteen-year-old sport soccer with his chest out

1409
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:30,655
Finger lady at a drive-in

1410
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:36,031
Is really gross

1411
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:42,687
I wanted a fingerblast a Punk Rock Girl

1412
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:44,479
At least that would be pretty gray

1413
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:45,759
Also

1414
01:10:46,015 --> 01:10:47,039
Much like him

1415
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:52,415
Not understanding that what's at issue is not whether or not he was literally the Joker

1416
01:10:53,695 --> 01:10:59,839
We're also not concerned with you faking confidence in order to connect with other humans

1417
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:03,679
What's an issue is whether or not you're still angry

1418
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:07,519
I do love how

1419
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:09,567
Incorrectly sites

1420
01:11:10,591 --> 01:11:14,175
William Shakespeare

1421
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:19,551
He just came up with that off the top of the stove

1422
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:22,367
Maybe one of the most

1423
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:23,391
Famous

1424
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:25,951
Phrases in the history of the world

1425
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:32,351
I might have thought that Alex Jones thought that one up as dumb as he thinks they are

1426
01:11:32,607 --> 01:11:36,191
Into The Bard

1427
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:36,959
He said that

1428
01:11:37,215 --> 01:11:42,847
An act can be anything you wanted to be with you like

1429
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:50,783
Silly idiot for thinking that the

1430
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:51,807
Actual definition

1431
01:11:53,599 --> 01:11:54,879
Is that word within the context

1432
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:56,927
And that word

1433
01:11:57,183 --> 01:12:01,023
Has a f****** Warrior all along it's been an act

1434
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:02,303
Okay

1435
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:03,839
I would I would look

1436
01:12:04,095 --> 01:12:10,239
And I'm doing this to get chick because this is not a

1437
01:12:10,495 --> 01:12:16,639
Video podcast episode I shouldn't have done that I apologize

1438
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:28,159
You don't OPP dress up like a joker I don't give a s***

1439
01:12:28,415 --> 01:12:32,511
Whatever you do in your bedroom which rear end

1440
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:38,399
So this next clip

1441
01:12:38,655 --> 01:12:40,959
Things that I did read that I found very

1442
01:12:43,007 --> 01:12:44,031
Broadcast

1443
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:50,431
No permit no people misrepresenting that he has a giant Studio that he broadcast

1444
01:12:50,687 --> 01:12:52,479
Sometimes he does special reports

1445
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:53,247
From the home

1446
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:55,551
This was recorded in like a study

1447
01:12:56,831 --> 01:12:59,647
And sometimes he's in the living room and you know it

1448
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:00,927
Videos

1449
01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:07,071
IPhone video stopping home

1450
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:08,863
Did the Giants

1451
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:12,959
Studio

1452
01:13:13,215 --> 01:13:19,359
You can get mad at people living in their parents basement you shoot your f****** show out of your home

1453
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:20,127
Second

1454
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:22,687
Sometimes

1455
01:13:22,943 --> 01:13:23,967
He will videotape

1456
01:13:24,223 --> 01:13:24,735
Himself

1457
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:27,295
Like just about everybody on YouTube

1458
01:13:27,551 --> 01:13:29,087
Yeah but not his show show

1459
01:13:29,343 --> 01:13:34,719
Broadcast every day I was I was I was really concerned about that be

1460
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:35,743
Because every time I

1461
01:13:36,511 --> 01:13:37,535
A picture of a studio

1462
01:13:38,559 --> 01:13:39,071
He's got a room

1463
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:45,471
House for that she has a smaller Studio e broadcast out of like on Sundays it's possible that that one would be

1464
01:13:45,727 --> 01:13:46,239
Be in a basement

1465
01:13:46,495 --> 01:13:50,591
Something like that small enough could be

1466
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:52,383
Just a secondary studio in his Warehouse

1467
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:54,175
Anyway

1468
01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:56,479
The next couple clips of just

1469
01:13:57,759 --> 01:14:01,343
Again I fucken understand what people are actually talking about with him being

1470
01:14:03,903 --> 01:14:04,415
Yes

1471
01:14:05,951 --> 01:14:06,463
So

1472
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:09,279
When they didn't say I'm fake

1473
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:12,863
Because his place me as a joker or me

1474
01:14:17,215 --> 01:14:19,263
You're supposed to videos on making fun of me

1475
01:14:19,775 --> 01:14:23,871
You know where I'm at

1476
01:14:29,759 --> 01:14:32,575
It's like some fake Christians

1477
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:40,255
I would argue that his whole show is largely grandstanding

1478
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:46,911
About people being dumb and not realizing their work that walk among us and want to kill us

1479
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:48,191
Have you seen

1480
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:50,751
Who's that

1481
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:54,847
The Joker not a one string

1482
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:05,343
I like you just got it

1483
01:15:05,599 --> 01:15:07,903
Got him

1484
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:08,671
1 in

1485
01:15:08,927 --> 01:15:11,487
That is so unusual and so out of

1486
01:15:11,743 --> 01:15:13,791
Any contact whatsoever

1487
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:19,423
That is creating that false equivalency there in order to make it seem like what they're saying

1488
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:21,215
Which is reasonable

1489
01:15:21,471 --> 01:15:23,263
Is a kin to him dressing

1490
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:26,079
Like the Joker

1491
01:15:28,895 --> 01:15:32,223
Yeah he basically is using himself as a strawman argument

1492
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:38,367
Kind of explaining what is happening no because if he was actually doing that

1493
01:15:38,623 --> 01:15:41,951
Like if he was aware of that boring control he can make the argument

1494
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:45,279
Give me better so confusing memes that he doesn't

1495
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:47,327
Understand

1496
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:50,655
I think from listening to this especially I know where it's going

1497
01:15:50,911 --> 01:15:52,959
Like I legitimately think that he

1498
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:54,495
He genuinely believed

1499
01:15:54,751 --> 01:15:55,263
That's what

1500
01:15:55,519 --> 01:16:01,407
That sort of thing is what people are like

1501
01:16:01,919 --> 01:16:02,431
Haha

1502
01:16:03,711 --> 01:16:04,991
Victor's really Illy

1503
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:12,927
If it even gets worse

1504
01:16:13,183 --> 01:16:13,695
Hannibal Lecter

1505
01:16:14,207 --> 01:16:19,071
It gets worse there is one clip that I'm going to play it

1506
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:20,095
There's no

1507
01:16:20,351 --> 01:16:22,143
Play towards the end of this

1508
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:28,543
Just literally titled probably going to be used in court

1509
01:16:31,871 --> 01:16:32,895
Nevermind

1510
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:41,855
And it's just like they're all taken out of context

1511
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:48,511
Yeah when the feds show up or whatever

1512
01:16:49,535 --> 01:16:51,327
He pissed me off

1513
01:16:52,095 --> 01:16:54,399
I was angry with my dog just died

1514
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:55,167
But also

1515
01:16:55,423 --> 01:16:56,447
The feds showed up

1516
01:16:57,983 --> 01:17:01,055
You think so fascinating him for Russian ties

1517
01:17:01,311 --> 01:17:02,591
What do you think you would ask him

1518
01:17:02,847 --> 01:17:03,615
Can rice be like

1519
01:17:03,871 --> 01:17:06,943
Do you have Russian

1520
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:12,831
No do that showed up about video where he said he was going to punch

1521
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:14,367
Cuz I don't think there's a

1522
01:17:14,623 --> 01:17:15,135
The chance

1523
01:17:16,415 --> 01:17:18,975
I can't imagine them having the time

1524
01:17:19,999 --> 01:17:22,303
I imagine most federal agencies

1525
01:17:22,559 --> 01:17:23,071
They're busy

1526
01:17:23,327 --> 01:17:24,095
I can imagine

1527
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:26,655
I don't know man

1528
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:33,055
There's alot going on in the world

1529
01:17:33,311 --> 01:17:38,943
I think they're more interested in some local dick weed

1530
01:17:39,455 --> 01:17:42,015
That's what everybody's really good bass.

1531
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:47,903
No cuz based on his Alex's hold

1532
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:48,927
Premise

1533
01:17:49,183 --> 01:17:51,231
Oh that's right the Patriot fans are taking over

1534
01:17:53,791 --> 01:17:56,607
Probably part of the counter counter counter coup

1535
01:17:56,863 --> 01:18:00,959
Who's going on if you guys

1536
01:18:01,215 --> 01:18:07,359
F****** programming app get at me get me if you can program

1537
01:18:07,615 --> 01:18:08,127
Rap

1538
01:18:09,407 --> 01:18:10,175
Your speech like

1539
01:18:10,431 --> 01:18:11,967
How dare you meet me in the street

1540
01:18:13,503 --> 01:18:17,087
I don't Parker literally I'm not really planning

1541
01:18:17,343 --> 01:18:23,487
Holy crap

1542
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:29,887
So then I might know it's performance art

1543
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:31,935
What is it when you say

1544
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:38,591
Yeah that's kind of

1545
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:39,359
Dude

1546
01:18:39,871 --> 01:18:42,175
You don't want me to

1547
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:43,455
Molester

1548
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:47,551
Would you have in the past

1549
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:49,087
In the table cut that icon

1550
01:18:49,343 --> 01:18:50,879
Probably say I said that so

1551
01:18:51,135 --> 01:18:51,647
You did

1552
01:18:51,903 --> 01:18:54,975
It isn't about Alex Jones and that's what frustrates me about

1553
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:56,255
Is this treats me to

1554
01:18:56,511 --> 01:18:58,047
This part of

1555
01:18:58,303 --> 01:19:00,095
It's like okay so it's

1556
01:19:00,351 --> 01:19:06,495
The performance are what is it if I say I want to attack

1557
01:19:09,311 --> 01:19:12,895
And I'm like really hard you're not going to say

1558
01:19:13,151 --> 01:19:13,663
Wow

1559
01:19:14,431 --> 01:19:15,455
That is really great for 4

1560
01:19:18,271 --> 01:19:21,343
Yeah so that would be at least a hypothetical threat

1561
01:19:21,599 --> 01:19:26,463
What would it be if you were a child molester

1562
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:27,487
Booby slander

1563
01:19:27,743 --> 01:19:31,583
Performance art either

1564
01:19:31,839 --> 01:19:37,983
Yeah ever here so I don't think he understands it all what anyone's talked about

1565
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:38,751
In the moment

1566
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:40,543
18

1567
01:19:40,799 --> 01:19:41,311
A teacher

1568
01:19:43,871 --> 01:19:45,919
I think he's not well right now

1569
01:19:49,503 --> 01:19:50,015
Wandering around

1570
01:19:50,783 --> 01:19:51,295
Understand

1571
01:19:52,063 --> 01:19:52,831
Like every

1572
01:19:53,087 --> 01:19:53,855
Every single moment

1573
01:19:55,135 --> 01:19:56,159
Has been pure

1574
01:19:56,671 --> 01:19:57,183
Abject

1575
01:19:57,439 --> 01:19:57,951
Confusion over

1576
01:19:58,207 --> 01:19:58,975
What is real

1577
01:20:01,535 --> 01:20:02,047
Yes

1578
01:20:03,327 --> 01:20:04,863
That's probably

1579
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:11,519
I mean you got to assume that like around 6 felt alienated because of his mother

1580
01:20:11,775 --> 01:20:17,152
Rejecting anything he doesn't get love anymore she probably started to feel these

1581
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:19,968
These real confused powerless feeling

1582
01:20:20,224 --> 01:20:21,760
And that makes the world terrifying

1583
01:20:22,016 --> 01:20:22,784
So you start

1584
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:28,416
Thinking you're more grown-up than you are you start reading military history books and not really understanding them

1585
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:30,976
Start to get childish ideas

1586
01:20:31,232 --> 01:20:33,280
Mixed in with some curls

1587
01:20:33,536 --> 01:20:35,328
Effectual history

1588
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:39,424
So you get this warped view of the world you get narratives that

1589
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:40,448
Don't exist

1590
01:20:40,704 --> 01:20:41,216
Filling in

1591
01:20:41,472 --> 01:20:45,056
Then around the age of 12 you find this cockamamie bulshit book

1592
01:20:45,312 --> 01:20:46,848
None dare call it conspiracy

1593
01:20:47,104 --> 01:20:48,640
That's just basically

1594
01:20:48,896 --> 01:20:52,992
Nonsense repackaged anti-Semitism about the globalist

1595
01:20:53,504 --> 01:20:56,576
The dangers of socialism turning into communism

1596
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:00,672
Japanese baseball

1597
01:21:01,184 --> 01:21:02,464
I mean this is so simple

1598
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:05,280
It really is this simple

1599
01:21:05,536 --> 01:21:08,096
Next question a lot of rest of the stuff is just window dressing

1600
01:21:08,608 --> 01:21:09,376
When he gets drunk

1601
01:21:09,632 --> 01:21:10,656
I'm really bummed out now

1602
01:21:10,912 --> 01:21:11,936
Did he see pink

1603
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:12,704
Open dancing

1604
01:21:13,472 --> 01:21:15,264
No they like it

1605
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:19,104
Tex Avery cartoon

1606
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:22,176
BTU has delirium tremens

1607
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:25,760
Anyway Alex is at this next clip

1608
01:21:26,016 --> 01:21:27,296
Oh by the way I think I

1609
01:21:27,552 --> 01:21:33,696
Just Express what I would call the unified field theory about

1610
01:21:33,952 --> 01:21:36,768
Documented him saying all of these things

1611
01:21:37,024 --> 01:21:38,560
Throughout the course of Justice

1612
01:21:38,816 --> 01:21:43,424
4 months you get a picture of someone who's

1613
01:21:43,936 --> 01:21:48,288
Had a real tough time for the last 35 years

1614
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:51,360
I wish there was an actual

1615
01:21:52,384 --> 01:21:52,896
Accessed

1616
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:53,920
To him where we could just

1617
01:21:55,456 --> 01:21:55,968
Deism

1618
01:21:56,224 --> 01:21:58,016
Well I might imagine

1619
01:21:58,272 --> 01:21:59,040
Just want to wake up

1620
01:22:00,576 --> 01:22:01,600
Go throughout a day

1621
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:03,392
And

1622
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:04,416
I will wear

1623
01:22:05,696 --> 01:22:08,256
Cedar Park Adams

1624
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:11,584
Halloween just like sitting in

1625
01:22:12,608 --> 01:22:17,728
See what's going on the problem is you never be granted that access until

1626
01:22:17,984 --> 01:22:23,104
Until everything falls apart a vent his life but I would be interested

1627
01:22:23,872 --> 01:22:24,640
I'm telling you this

1628
01:22:25,664 --> 01:22:28,480
Michael Savage

1629
01:22:28,992 --> 01:22:29,760
In the book

1630
01:22:30,016 --> 01:22:31,040
You will write all the in

1631
01:22:31,296 --> 01:22:31,808
Information

1632
01:22:32,064 --> 01:22:33,088
And then I'll have in the foot

1633
01:22:33,344 --> 01:22:33,856
Footnote

1634
01:22:35,904 --> 01:22:41,024
And that'll be it that'll be my contribution right I feel like I'm doing the right thing

1635
01:22:41,536 --> 01:22:44,864
Alex has more thoughts about how he is

1636
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:47,680
Sinon

1637
01:22:47,936 --> 01:22:48,704
Court TV

1638
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:53,312
Cowboys

1639
01:22:55,104 --> 01:22:57,152
I've seen a lawyer basketball court TV

1640
01:22:57,664 --> 01:22:58,944
Articles I read

1641
01:22:59,456 --> 01:23:02,528
They'll say how do you know the truth how you do front most recent

1642
01:23:04,832 --> 01:23:07,392
How good they look how nice

1643
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:09,696
Off the

1644
01:23:10,976 --> 01:23:12,768
Is there an unelected EU

1645
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:15,328
Is there an elected level un

1646
01:23:18,656 --> 01:23:20,448
Open

1647
01:23:20,704 --> 01:23:22,752
But a hundred dollars taxes every decade

1648
01:23:23,008 --> 01:23:24,544
Absolutely

1649
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:30,944
George Soros

1650
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:31,712
Yes

1651
01:23:31,968 --> 01:23:35,296
Did he admit he fun of the Arab Spring

1652
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:36,832
No

1653
01:23:37,088 --> 01:23:40,672
I have an Empower you

1654
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:44,512
Opposite

1655
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:50,656
Do the anti-second is after listing

1656
01:23:51,936 --> 01:23:54,496
Some handed funding

1657
01:23:54,752 --> 01:23:55,776
AR groups

1658
01:23:56,288 --> 01:23:58,080
But he didn't fund the Arabs

1659
01:23:58,336 --> 01:23:58,848
Spring

1660
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:03,968
Create the Arab Spring group global humanitarian

1661
01:24:04,992 --> 01:24:05,504
Ukraine

1662
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:06,272
No

1663
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:10,368
How about the Arab Spring

1664
01:24:11,136 --> 01:24:13,184
Not all of it so we're those like people

1665
01:24:13,696 --> 01:24:14,464
Those people

1666
01:24:14,976 --> 01:24:17,536
So they were kind of like mad at the authoritarian

1667
01:24:21,632 --> 01:24:24,448
And some of those groups may have gotten some money from George Soros

1668
01:24:24,704 --> 01:24:25,216
Because

1669
01:24:25,472 --> 01:24:30,080
Like I said he's a global either Global philanthropist George Soros

1670
01:24:30,336 --> 01:24:34,944
Call them up

1671
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:44,928
Rockefeller George Soros Hungarian

1672
01:24:46,208 --> 01:24:48,512
But all that s*** is wack

1673
01:24:48,768 --> 01:24:49,792
All that stuff is b*******

1674
01:24:53,632 --> 01:24:55,168
The EU is unelected

1675
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:58,496
August

1676
01:24:58,752 --> 01:25:01,824
Secretary of state is unelected then

1677
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:02,592
Hooray

1678
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:07,200
Like if you really want it if it's true if you want to get it never considered that

1679
01:25:07,456 --> 01:25:07,968
I think

1680
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:10,272
We should vote for secretary

1681
01:25:10,528 --> 01:25:13,600
You know what's crazy

1682
01:25:13,856 --> 01:25:16,416
If we did that we would actually have a functioning

1683
01:25:16,672 --> 01:25:17,952
Secretary of goddamn

1684
01:25:20,256 --> 01:25:23,328
Filled with people who do their goddamn job

1685
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:29,728
If you want to take a step back and not just use the examples that he listed

1686
01:25:30,496 --> 01:25:32,032
This litanies of Lies

1687
01:25:32,288 --> 01:25:33,312
I mean there's plenty of

1688
01:25:34,592 --> 01:25:39,968
We have plenty on our website knowledge lies

1689
01:25:40,224 --> 01:25:43,808
30% off

1690
01:25:44,064 --> 01:25:50,208
A hundred percent

1691
01:25:50,464 --> 01:25:56,608
Website for free spoiler alert it's no longer Easter

1692
01:25:57,888 --> 01:25:58,400
So

1693
01:25:59,168 --> 01:26:00,448
In this next clip Alex

1694
01:26:00,704 --> 01:26:04,800
Is kind of something but he uses the brightness wrong

1695
01:26:05,312 --> 01:26:09,920
He explains that the things that the media is doing right now The Joke is on You

1696
01:26:10,432 --> 01:26:11,200
The people who are listening

1697
01:26:11,712 --> 01:26:13,760
Are you kind of right I always needed

1698
01:26:14,272 --> 01:26:16,832
All the old be like out of context

1699
01:26:17,088 --> 01:26:18,112
People post about him

1700
01:26:18,368 --> 01:26:20,416
It is kind of a psyop again

1701
01:26:20,672 --> 01:26:21,440
The people watching

1702
01:26:21,952 --> 01:26:23,488
Because they do give the wrong impression

1703
01:26:23,744 --> 01:26:24,256
Anabolic

1704
01:26:24,768 --> 01:26:26,048
But again as we keep

1705
01:26:26,304 --> 01:26:27,072
Keep coming back

1706
01:26:27,328 --> 01:26:28,096
It's a better picture

1707
01:26:28,608 --> 01:26:30,144
It was a joke as a better pic

1708
01:26:30,912 --> 01:26:32,448
Then the reality of

1709
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:36,032
I completely damaged man lashing out at the world through his audience

1710
01:26:38,592 --> 01:26:39,104
An inuk

1711
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:40,384
Applicable number of

1712
01:26:41,408 --> 01:26:42,432
Damaged people listening

1713
01:26:42,688 --> 01:26:43,968
Yeah

1714
01:26:45,248 --> 01:26:47,040
And a revelant

1715
01:26:47,296 --> 01:26:49,856
Be strong because I never apologized

1716
01:26:51,392 --> 01:26:54,208
Long sometimes every month

1717
01:26:54,976 --> 01:26:56,512
Something

1718
01:26:59,584 --> 01:27:05,728
That's not true he apologized because he got a letter from James Oliphant

1719
01:27:05,984 --> 01:27:11,616
Really even apologize about that he still has not addressed the that mosque

1720
01:27:11,872 --> 01:27:14,176
Shooter was a white dude in Montreal

1721
01:27:14,432 --> 01:27:16,992
He still has been peddling a horrible

1722
01:27:17,248 --> 01:27:19,040
Lies about George Soros being a Nazi

1723
01:27:19,296 --> 01:27:20,832
Collaborator

1724
01:27:21,344 --> 01:27:22,112
Sandy Hook

1725
01:27:22,624 --> 01:27:23,648
Dances now

1726
01:27:23,904 --> 01:27:25,440
I'm just asking question

1727
01:27:25,696 --> 01:27:28,000
There are a lot of questions to ask

1728
01:27:28,512 --> 01:27:34,144
20% of our uranium

1729
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:35,424
To the Russians

1730
01:27:35,936 --> 01:27:40,032
Not true he owes an apology on that you never correct

1731
01:27:40,288 --> 01:27:41,056
I'm selfish

1732
01:27:41,312 --> 01:27:41,824
He's

1733
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:43,104
Called a lot of pee

1734
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:43,872
People pedophile

1735
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:47,968
Lot of them

1736
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:51,296
Renfield

1737
01:27:51,808 --> 01:27:56,416
He's made a lot of people and he's never really apologize

1738
01:28:01,024 --> 01:28:03,584
And then run around and say Jones admits he's fake

1739
01:28:04,864 --> 01:28:06,400
IHOP on you

1740
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:08,448
Quite frankly

1741
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:11,008
I become such a logo OR

1742
01:28:11,264 --> 01:28:12,032
Icon

1743
01:28:12,544 --> 01:28:13,568
Resistance

1744
01:28:13,824 --> 01:28:15,104
Their attacks on me

1745
01:28:15,872 --> 01:28:17,152
Only making 4

1746
01:28:18,176 --> 01:28:19,456
This is a big Essentia the Tampa

1747
01:28:22,272 --> 01:28:24,320
I want to see I'm very humble.

1748
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:28,672
You want to wreck your mind

1749
01:28:28,928 --> 01:28:32,256
Were you don't believe there's anybody

1750
01:28:32,768 --> 01:28:33,536
But you know

1751
01:28:33,792 --> 01:28:34,304
You're good

1752
01:28:35,328 --> 01:28:36,608
You know you have ho

1753
01:28:38,144 --> 01:28:39,936
All the policy all the culture

1754
01:28:40,192 --> 01:28:41,472
Everything I promote

1755
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:51,200
Dangerous crap

1756
01:28:51,968 --> 01:28:54,016
Fundamentally who I am

1757
01:28:54,784 --> 01:28:55,808
That's fundamentally

1758
01:28:56,064 --> 01:29:02,208
We're changing the world we're in this together

1759
01:29:02,464 --> 01:29:05,536
Of course I believe what I say

1760
01:29:05,792 --> 01:29:07,840
That's going to be a problem

1761
01:29:08,096 --> 01:29:09,888
Chimeras

1762
01:29:10,144 --> 01:29:12,192
That's going to be a problem

1763
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:16,032
I swear to God I bet he could win a governorship

1764
01:29:18,592 --> 01:29:19,872
No chimera

1765
01:29:26,016 --> 01:29:29,856
That's going to be a problem

1766
01:29:31,136 --> 01:29:32,672
Christian Fourier

1767
01:29:33,184 --> 01:29:37,536
Cuban animal hybrids with which they turn into a joke

1768
01:29:37,792 --> 01:29:38,816
But is all admitted

1769
01:29:39,072 --> 01:29:40,864
What are you f******

1770
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:46,496
It's not about it but also like I love that's like the second thing he comes up with after freedom

1771
01:29:48,032 --> 01:29:48,544
Freedom

1772
01:29:49,056 --> 01:29:50,848
No human-animal hybrid

1773
01:29:51,616 --> 01:29:52,384
I don't understand

1774
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:54,688
Those are the two most pressing issues in mind

1775
01:29:55,200 --> 01:30:00,832
I've read all the articles about chimeras and they don't say what he says

1776
01:30:01,344 --> 01:30:02,112
Fullmetal Alchemist

1777
01:30:02,624 --> 01:30:08,256
I didn't okay well

1778
01:30:08,768 --> 01:30:09,792
Alchemist

1779
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:12,352
Create chimeras

1780
01:30:12,608 --> 01:30:13,376
Okay I just

1781
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:15,680
Human transmutation is bad

1782
01:30:16,192 --> 01:30:18,240
Just as a heads up for anybody

1783
01:30:19,264 --> 01:30:19,776
Don't transmit

1784
01:30:20,288 --> 01:30:22,080
Alex

1785
01:30:22,336 --> 01:30:23,872
Russell's even further

1786
01:30:24,128 --> 01:30:26,944
With the idea of what it means to play a role

1787
01:30:27,456 --> 01:30:32,576
I didn't like I said I didn't cut out everything in between these clips will they seem really disjointed because they are

1788
01:30:32,832 --> 01:30:37,184
The entire video is available I think it'll be taken down at some point

1789
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:40,000
It's super disjointed Buc-ee's just

1790
01:30:40,256 --> 01:30:42,304
He's not making sense

1791
01:30:43,328 --> 01:30:45,376
This is all in chronological order with nothing cutout

1792
01:30:46,912 --> 01:30:48,192
This is this is wild

1793
01:30:49,472 --> 01:30:51,008
Of course I believe what I say

1794
01:30:51,776 --> 01:30:53,056
Unless they go clip

1795
01:30:54,592 --> 01:30:56,128
Devil's Advocate

1796
01:30:58,432 --> 01:30:58,944
As

1797
01:31:04,064 --> 01:31:08,416
Skip

1798
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,816
When he goes and does his gifts if you do exactly who you are

1799
01:31:15,328 --> 01:31:20,192
Of course he has political you using

1800
01:31:23,264 --> 01:31:26,336
Horton and I think some of the public

1801
01:31:33,248 --> 01:31:34,016
Google

1802
01:31:34,272 --> 01:31:35,552
I like

1803
01:31:37,088 --> 01:31:40,416
With contractors sang b-list Us in huge contracts

1804
01:31:40,928 --> 01:31:44,000
They just admitted that was true and they just said it was an accident

1805
01:31:44,256 --> 01:31:45,536
Cuz I saw my video

1806
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:47,072
Coralite out everything

1807
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:50,656
You're lying

1808
01:31:50,912 --> 01:31:52,192
Nope

1809
01:31:52,448 --> 01:31:53,728
Perfect example of him being

1810
01:31:53,984 --> 01:31:54,496
Completely

1811
01:31:54,752 --> 01:31:55,776
Fake news

1812
01:31:56,288 --> 01:31:57,312
But then

1813
01:31:59,616 --> 01:32:03,712
What is Alec Baldwin

1814
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:10,112
Yes everyone knows that when Alec Baldwin brass balls

1815
01:32:11,136 --> 01:32:12,416
We all know

1816
01:32:13,184 --> 01:32:13,952
All the world

1817
01:32:14,976 --> 01:32:15,744
So perhaps

1818
01:32:16,256 --> 01:32:17,536
We are truly all a

1819
01:32:18,304 --> 01:32:19,328
Did you consider that

1820
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:20,352
I don't

1821
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:23,680
Is that even your real name

1822
01:32:24,192 --> 01:32:24,704
Mr. freeze

1823
01:32:27,776 --> 01:32:28,800
So dumb

1824
01:32:29,312 --> 01:32:30,336
8

1825
01:32:30,848 --> 01:32:32,896
So pointless under

1826
01:32:36,224 --> 01:32:36,992
I don't know

1827
01:32:37,248 --> 01:32:38,016
Possible

1828
01:32:39,296 --> 01:32:39,808
The difference

1829
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:41,344
Between an

1830
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:43,392
Accident

1831
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:47,744
Sing that

1832
01:32:48,768 --> 01:32:49,536
Primarily

1833
01:32:49,792 --> 01:32:50,816
Pedophile ring

1834
01:32:51,072 --> 01:32:51,584
Underwrap

1835
01:32:52,608 --> 01:32:58,752
Well then let's even take that away because he apologized for that

1836
01:32:59,008 --> 01:33:01,056
Government works off of pedophile blackmail

1837
01:33:02,848 --> 01:33:03,360
Yeah

1838
01:33:03,616 --> 01:33:06,176
Play

1839
01:33:06,432 --> 01:33:08,224
If you if you are going to

1840
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:10,528
If your

1841
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:11,552
Right

1842
01:33:11,808 --> 01:33:12,320
Now

1843
01:33:12,576 --> 01:33:14,368
Here is his rule

1844
01:33:14,624 --> 01:33:15,648
That he should use

1845
01:33:18,208 --> 01:33:19,232
So if you're listening AJ

1846
01:33:20,512 --> 01:33:23,328
I got you I got a shopping

1847
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:26,400
According to his own

1848
01:33:27,424 --> 01:33:28,192
Words right

1849
01:33:28,448 --> 01:33:28,960
He's

1850
01:33:29,216 --> 01:33:30,240
Exaggerating

1851
01:33:30,496 --> 01:33:31,008
Acting

1852
01:33:31,264 --> 01:33:32,032
To show what he's

1853
01:33:33,568 --> 01:33:37,408
So if you're going to call him describing everybody in the government

1854
01:33:37,664 --> 01:33:38,176
Working off a

1855
01:33:38,432 --> 01:33:39,456
Pedophile

1856
01:33:41,248 --> 01:33:44,576
Maybe you can say that he's just exaggerating it

1857
01:33:44,832 --> 01:33:45,600
The same way that he

1858
01:33:45,856 --> 01:33:47,136
Play Devil's Advocate

1859
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:49,440
As the Joker whatever

1860
01:33:52,512 --> 01:33:53,024
Make your point

1861
01:33:53,536 --> 01:33:55,840
If he's going to do that

1862
01:33:58,912 --> 01:33:59,680
Beyond

1863
01:33:59,936 --> 01:34:01,984
What is a reasonable concept

1864
01:34:02,496 --> 01:34:04,032
In order to demonstrate

1865
01:34:04,288 --> 01:34:06,592
What he feels is the true evil beneatha

1866
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:12,480
Like like oh you're you're you're

1867
01:34:12,736 --> 01:34:14,272
Okay your comic book villain

1868
01:34:14,528 --> 01:34:18,112
Is an amplified version of whatever negative traded is that you wants

1869
01:34:18,624 --> 01:34:19,392
That you want to describe

1870
01:34:19,648 --> 01:34:20,672
You know you have your

1871
01:34:22,464 --> 01:34:23,744
Lex Luthor

1872
01:34:24,256 --> 01:34:25,024
Who is just an amp

1873
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:25,792
5 billion

1874
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:28,096
Who just takes things so far away

1875
01:34:28,608 --> 01:34:29,120
Is all

1876
01:34:29,632 --> 01:34:30,144
Bruce Wayne is

1877
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:33,984
So you have your Amplified version

1878
01:34:34,496 --> 01:34:36,288
Describing what it is that you're a

1879
01:34:36,544 --> 01:34:37,056
Actually again

1880
01:34:37,312 --> 01:34:39,360
Do Hillary Clinton herself

1881
01:34:39,616 --> 01:34:41,408
Is a vampire squid

1882
01:34:41,664 --> 01:34:43,968
In the same way that Matt describe

1883
01:34:44,992 --> 01:34:46,272
Way back when regarding

1884
01:34:46,528 --> 01:34:47,296
Golden Goldman

1885
01:34:48,064 --> 01:34:48,576
Right

1886
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:51,392
Do you do you see how that

1887
01:34:52,672 --> 01:34:54,208
Walnut a good arguments

1888
01:34:54,976 --> 01:34:56,256
One that you could skate by

1889
01:34:56,768 --> 01:34:58,304
No you don't think so

1890
01:34:59,072 --> 01:35:00,864
Not really okay so

1891
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:02,656
No because Alex Jones

1892
01:35:02,912 --> 01:35:04,448
Playing the role of the

1893
01:35:04,704 --> 01:35:05,216
The villain

1894
01:35:05,472 --> 01:35:05,984
Or whatever

1895
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:09,568
Him yelling about the like

1896
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:10,848
The globalist

1897
01:35:11,104 --> 01:35:12,640
Views children as

1898
01:35:13,408 --> 01:35:14,176
Flake

1899
01:35:14,432 --> 01:35:19,296
I retract

1900
01:35:19,552 --> 01:35:22,368
Because I just heard yet again you say

1901
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:23,392
The globalist

1902
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:25,184
Use children as Kurt

1903
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:27,744
There's no there's nothing to say

1904
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:32,352
Is Joker think we're alike

1905
01:35:32,608 --> 01:35:36,704
He's out there saying everyone should get back to Maiden ordered make the point don't get vaccinated

1906
01:35:42,336 --> 01:35:43,872
That's why he thinks it's that tire

1907
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:46,432
Because he dressed up as the Joker

1908
01:35:46,688 --> 01:35:47,200
Yeah

1909
01:35:48,992 --> 01:35:51,552
And did exactly the opposite of what his point was

1910
01:35:52,064 --> 01:35:56,672
So if he's doing that in the instance of the you like pedophile sex rings and stuff like that

1911
01:35:57,184 --> 01:35:58,976
He is

1912
01:35:59,232 --> 01:36:04,352
No no no I'm saying that if this is the parody is actually trying to make is that

1913
01:36:04,864 --> 01:36:06,656
People in the government don't do this stuff

1914
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:10,496
Haha pretty cool perhaps

1915
01:36:10,752 --> 01:36:14,336
Maybe he's trying to do a reductio ad absurdum argument

1916
01:36:14,592 --> 01:36:15,104
He's not

1917
01:36:15,616 --> 01:36:16,128
Nuno

1918
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:18,432
This is a bummer

1919
01:36:18,688 --> 01:36:19,456
Wouldn't it be nice

1920
01:36:19,712 --> 01:36:25,856
Wouldn't it be nice if that f****** crazy

1921
01:36:27,136 --> 01:36:33,280
And you said you weren't good at in promise Who's Line Is It Anyways level Improv

1922
01:36:33,536 --> 01:36:35,072
On the way

1923
01:36:37,632 --> 01:36:39,424
No one has ever said

1924
01:36:41,728 --> 01:36:42,240
Equipped

1925
01:36:42,496 --> 01:36:44,544
About how he was right about Syria

1926
01:36:45,056 --> 01:36:45,568
The pointless

1927
01:36:48,896 --> 01:36:49,408
Who's next

1928
01:36:49,664 --> 01:36:50,176
Yes

1929
01:36:50,688 --> 01:36:51,968
This is really where

1930
01:36:52,224 --> 01:36:52,992
I think

1931
01:36:53,504 --> 01:36:55,040
I would like us to

1932
01:36:55,808 --> 01:36:58,112
Really absorb this clip because I think it's it's

1933
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:01,184
I think it's Alex wrestling with the fact that his audiences

1934
01:37:02,208 --> 01:37:03,744
He doesn't know how to do it

1935
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,048
He doesn't know how to say I can't believe you guys

1936
01:37:06,816 --> 01:37:07,584
Are this dumb

1937
01:37:09,632 --> 01:37:10,912
There's alot going on

1938
01:37:11,168 --> 01:37:11,680
Yes

1939
01:37:12,192 --> 01:37:16,544
Schmaltz

1940
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:19,104
You feel like you got conned

1941
01:37:20,384 --> 01:37:22,688
345 hours a day

1942
01:37:24,736 --> 01:37:25,760
Yeah she's being real

1943
01:37:29,856 --> 01:37:31,904
Chimeras

1944
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:34,976
But sometimes if I go here

1945
01:37:35,232 --> 01:37:36,256
Clearly I'm

1946
01:37:36,512 --> 01:37:37,536
In a British accent

1947
01:37:38,048 --> 01:37:39,072
Sarcastic

1948
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:41,632
Reading Lord Rothschild quotes on air

1949
01:37:41,888 --> 01:37:44,448
I'm not agreeing with Lord Rothschild

1950
01:37:44,704 --> 01:37:46,240
I've almost killed all the time

1951
01:37:47,776 --> 01:37:51,360
Or not because

1952
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:53,152
Because

1953
01:37:55,968 --> 01:37:57,504
People sit there say

1954
01:37:58,272 --> 01:37:59,552
Why is he

1955
01:38:00,576 --> 01:38:03,136
Wearing a wig saying he's a British professor

1956
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:06,464
Doesn't he know this is fake

1957
01:38:07,488 --> 01:38:09,280
People don't know that so I go hey

1958
01:38:12,608 --> 01:38:15,168
How you doing

1959
01:38:15,424 --> 01:38:17,984
I have a syndicated radio show is a pundit

1960
01:38:19,776 --> 01:38:21,568
Regular Alex Jones that's real

1961
01:38:33,344 --> 01:38:35,904
I believe

1962
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:42,304
In the news

1963
01:38:45,888 --> 01:38:47,680
They're not even stupid

1964
01:38:47,936 --> 01:38:49,216
They want to act like

1965
01:38:49,984 --> 01:38:53,312
They've been wrong and betrayed their whatever even was hers to begin with

1966
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:56,640
That's very weird very weird

1967
01:38:56,896 --> 01:38:58,688
I think he is

1968
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:02,272
Okay

1969
01:39:02,528 --> 01:39:03,040
Okay

1970
01:39:08,672 --> 01:39:09,184
What did he do

1971
01:39:09,696 --> 01:39:13,536
Let's try I'm going to bring out a pan

1972
01:39:13,792 --> 01:39:14,560
We start with

1973
01:39:19,424 --> 01:39:20,704
I love I love your Foley

1974
01:39:24,032 --> 01:39:24,544
Right

1975
01:39:26,592 --> 01:39:27,360
The New York Times

1976
01:39:28,128 --> 01:39:31,968
He's killed that's how do you kill set timer how do you kill set

1977
01:39:32,224 --> 01:39:34,016
I think you killed it with that

1978
01:39:34,528 --> 01:39:37,088
You killed it with that Darnell

1979
01:39:37,344 --> 01:39:40,672
I think he's saying no cuz he's making the argument that like

1980
01:39:41,184 --> 01:39:42,464
People attack it so much

1981
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:43,744
They must be threatened

1982
01:39:45,792 --> 01:39:47,328
Did he did say that

1983
01:39:47,584 --> 01:39:49,632
Okay what do you meant was

1984
01:39:49,888 --> 01:39:51,680
He can no longer do that

1985
01:39:52,704 --> 01:39:53,472
Because

1986
01:39:53,728 --> 01:39:54,496
He has done it

1987
01:39:57,824 --> 01:39:58,848
I think that might be

1988
01:39:59,104 --> 01:40:00,640
I think that might be what

1989
01:40:01,408 --> 01:40:01,920
So

1990
01:40:02,176 --> 01:40:02,944
New York Times

1991
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:03,968
Videos

1992
01:40:04,224 --> 01:40:04,736
All of it

1993
01:40:05,248 --> 01:40:07,552
They don't understand

1994
01:40:09,088 --> 01:40:10,880
And they're like hey man why you doing that

1995
01:40:12,928 --> 01:40:15,744
You like come on it's that tire don't forget it don't forget it

1996
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:20,352
But I'm not being sad terumi I'm Alex Jones I'm a libertarian

1997
01:40:20,864 --> 01:40:22,912
How is he being sorry you can't be

1998
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:24,448
Sarcastic

1999
01:40:26,752 --> 01:40:27,264
At the same

2000
01:40:28,544 --> 01:40:29,056
This is

2001
01:40:29,312 --> 01:40:30,336
Alright this is insane

2002
01:40:30,592 --> 01:40:33,152
Here's the last

2003
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:34,944
Alright

2004
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:36,736
He just said the listeners

2005
01:40:38,016 --> 01:40:40,832
Actually Alex Jones listeners

2006
01:40:41,344 --> 01:40:43,392
Listening

2007
01:40:45,184 --> 01:40:45,952
Further MoMA

2008
01:40:46,720 --> 01:40:48,256
That they could jump off

2009
01:40:48,512 --> 01:40:51,840
Because that was their whole goal in the beginning

2010
01:40:52,096 --> 01:40:52,608
Listen

2011
01:40:53,632 --> 01:40:54,912
Yeah

2012
01:40:55,680 --> 01:40:59,776
Super weird Behavior

2013
01:41:01,312 --> 01:41:03,616
Is a surprise a person who doesn't really

2014
01:41:03,872 --> 01:41:10,016
Who doesn't really care about the movement

2015
01:41:11,552 --> 01:41:12,576
They're uninformed

2016
01:41:13,088 --> 01:41:14,624
They're The Uninvited

2017
01:41:16,416 --> 01:41:21,792
Thanks. Really what eyeshadow should have been called

2018
01:41:22,048 --> 01:41:22,816
This next clip

2019
01:41:24,096 --> 01:41:26,144
This next question

2020
01:41:27,168 --> 01:41:28,192
I think he doesn't know

2021
01:41:29,728 --> 01:41:30,240
Anyone

2022
01:41:30,752 --> 01:41:33,056
Because he's crazy

2023
01:41:33,312 --> 01:41:38,176
Nobody knows what is exact same kind of schizophrenia

2024
01:41:38,688 --> 01:41:40,992
I'm really dumb people think he's smart

2025
01:41:41,248 --> 01:41:42,784
But it's actually not mark

2026
01:41:43,808 --> 01:41:45,600
Scattered disjointed thinking

2027
01:41:45,856 --> 01:41:47,136
It appears kind of Deep

2028
01:41:48,160 --> 01:41:48,672
That's not

2029
01:41:50,208 --> 01:41:55,072
If you lie is about secret sources that he has why wouldn't dumb people believe him

2030
01:41:55,584 --> 01:41:56,096
That is a good

2031
01:41:56,608 --> 01:42:01,472
All of the verifiable sources that he's ever sighted have not said what he says they say

2032
01:42:01,728 --> 01:42:04,288
Secret sources

2033
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:05,568
Modulo

2034
01:42:05,824 --> 01:42:06,336
I did not

2035
01:42:06,848 --> 01:42:07,360
Consider his secret

2036
01:42:07,872 --> 01:42:10,944
Yeah but you got to be dumb to f****** believe in a****** like him

2037
01:42:11,456 --> 01:42:11,968
Great sources

2038
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:13,248
F******

2039
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:15,040
High level

2040
01:42:15,552 --> 01:42:17,344
I didn't know he had high-level sources

2041
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:20,160
Google Google

2042
01:42:20,416 --> 01:42:22,208
In the vendor company

2043
01:42:22,464 --> 01:42:24,256
Who Google subcontract

2044
01:42:24,512 --> 01:42:25,024
Yeah

2045
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:27,328
Go to my route

2046
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:29,376
In every Institution

2047
01:42:29,888 --> 01:42:30,400

Explaining these effect

2062
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:13,152
Now

2063
01:43:13,664 --> 01:43:14,944

I can't get into it later allowed amount

2072
01:43:41,312 --> 01:43:43,872
I need they are supposed

U-Pull-It

2077
01:43:54,624 --> 01:43:56,928
Because I touched you

2078
01:43:57,184 --> 01:43:58,720
You touch. You are the power

2079
01:43:58,976 --> 01:44:03,840
Cam

2080
01:44:04,096 --> 01:44:10,240
The videos the Article 13

I can speak to that

2082
01:44:13,312 --> 01:44:13,824
Everyone

2083
01:44:14,592 --> 01:44:17,408
Now right-thinking people are super against it because

2084
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:18,688
You lie all the f***

2085
01:44:18,944 --> 01:44:20,224
Sometimes you're a bigot

2086
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:21,504
Yeah

2087
01:44:22,784 --> 01:44:27,904
Cancerous forced to dialogue

2088
01:44:28,416 --> 01:44:29,696
Right real

2089
01:44:29,952 --> 01:44:36,096
To write all the time misunderstanding your sarcasm

2090
01:44:36,352 --> 01:44:37,888
What time I've seen you do something wacky

2091
01:44:38,144 --> 01:44:38,656
I get it

2092
01:44:38,912 --> 01:44:39,424
And

2093
01:44:41,472 --> 01:44:43,264
Hundred percent we even said

2094
01:44:43,776 --> 01:44:45,568
But even with that shift clip

2095
01:44:46,336 --> 01:44:47,104
He's drunk

2096
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:48,384
He's an a******

2097
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:54,784
But there was no part of us that was like you'd want to actually beat up shift

2098
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:59,904
Legal this isn't like this isn't his Free Speech you just being a dick

2099
01:45:01,184 --> 01:45:02,464
But what if we're wrong

2100
01:45:02,976 --> 01:45:03,488
No

2101
01:45:03,744 --> 01:45:05,792
Sew-in Annie goes through

2102
01:45:06,048 --> 01:45:07,072
All of these different

2103
01:45:07,584 --> 01:45:08,352
Circumstances

2104
01:45:08,608 --> 01:45:10,144
Everybody agreed

2105
01:45:10,912 --> 01:45:11,680
This is

2106
01:45:11,936 --> 01:45:12,704
Not true

2107
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:14,240
And then it was later proven

2108
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:16,544
All right now

2109
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:19,360
We have that moment with Alex

2110
01:45:19,616 --> 01:45:20,384
It's a natural

2111
01:45:20,640 --> 01:45:21,920
It is it is

2112
01:45:22,176 --> 01:45:25,504
One of the one of the things that I constantly like

2113
01:45:26,016 --> 01:45:28,064
Have to stop myself and just go

2114
01:45:29,856 --> 01:45:36,000
Yeah I have that moment until like research anything he talks about

2115
01:45:36,256 --> 01:45:36,768
Alright

2116
01:45:38,048 --> 01:45:38,816
Sometimes

2117
01:45:39,328 --> 01:45:40,864
Sometimes there's a part of me that's like

2118
01:45:41,376 --> 01:45:42,912
You're the worst

2119
01:45:43,424 --> 01:45:44,704
Sometimes I wish you

2120
01:45:45,728 --> 01:45:48,800
But the world to be more interesting how much more fun with

2121
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:50,592
And horrific

2122
01:45:51,104 --> 01:45:52,128
Miserable

2123
01:45:52,384 --> 01:45:56,992
Be so much more simple if we did have some sort of

2124
01:45:57,504 --> 01:45:58,016
You know

2125
01:45:58,272 --> 01:45:58,784
Arch

2126
01:45:59,296 --> 01:46:02,624
Global evil group that we legitimately had to fight again

2127
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:06,464
Because in reality

2128
01:46:06,720 --> 01:46:09,280
Everyone could come together much easily

2129
01:46:09,536 --> 01:46:11,840
But much more easily than it is we can now

2130
01:46:12,352 --> 01:46:13,632
Life would be so much

2131
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:22,336
Try me now it says I believe in the past also said that

2132
01:46:22,848 --> 01:46:25,408
The government is likely to get a fake alien attack

2133
01:46:26,176 --> 01:46:27,200
In order to

2134
01:46:27,968 --> 01:46:31,296
People how's it going to spam how fun would that be

2135
01:46:31,808 --> 01:46:33,600
Anyway

2136
01:46:33,856 --> 01:46:35,136
In his victim

2137
01:46:35,648 --> 01:46:37,440
Self victim status

2138
01:46:37,696 --> 01:46:38,208
Flaming

2139
01:46:38,464 --> 01:46:41,024
Yes in there you said

2140
01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:45,120
You know basically all these lies are going to come out I can't talk about it but

2141
01:46:45,376 --> 01:46:47,680
It's all lies and you're all going to see

2142
01:46:47,936 --> 01:46:49,984
Which is the beginning

2143
01:46:50,240 --> 01:46:54,592
It's against the law for contempt of court

2144
01:46:54,848 --> 01:46:55,872
For talking about it

2145
01:46:56,128 --> 01:46:56,640
That

2146
01:46:56,896 --> 01:46:57,920
Yeah it's bad

2147
01:46:58,432 --> 01:46:59,968
Yeah now this next clip

2148
01:47:00,224 --> 01:47:01,504
Is way worse

2149
01:47:02,272 --> 01:47:04,576
This next clip is like this

2150
01:47:05,856 --> 01:47:07,904
If his lawyer isn't screaming at him about this

2151
01:47:08,672 --> 01:47:09,184
That's bad luck

2152
01:47:11,488 --> 01:47:13,792
And I got the whole system come out

2153
01:47:14,304 --> 01:47:16,096
My family is just all about

2154
01:47:16,864 --> 01:47:18,144
Take everything away from

2155
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:18,912
I got them

2156
01:47:19,168 --> 01:47:21,216
Hit me on every front financially culturally

2157
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:26,592
No matter what happens

2158
01:47:28,128 --> 01:47:30,944
And all the other doors are open just like documents on Google

2159
01:47:36,576 --> 01:47:38,624
And that's why you got to be so scared they know genuineness

2160
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:47,584
Things my laziness and they don't do enough about that I'm totally real I want you to have a few

2161
01:47:48,608 --> 01:47:50,656
I see how pathetic dumb down the public is now sick

2162
01:47:51,168 --> 01:47:52,448
Comcast out of this attack

2163
01:47:55,520 --> 01:47:56,288
Well I'm just

2164
01:47:56,544 --> 01:47:57,568
I want you to win

2165
01:47:58,080 --> 01:47:59,360
I want you to win I love you

2166
01:47:59,872 --> 01:48:00,896
And I appreciate you

2167
01:48:01,152 --> 01:48:03,200
Hundred percent real when I say I want to do

2168
01:48:03,712 --> 01:48:05,248
They should take out contacts when I

2169
01:48:05,504 --> 01:48:07,296
The Shot Tower joke around so I got to say no.

2170
01:48:07,552 --> 01:48:11,904
That was a little performance

2171
01:48:12,416 --> 01:48:13,952
Respond before coffee shop

2172
01:48:14,720 --> 01:48:15,744
That's almost videos

2173
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:17,024
They take those now

2174
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:18,048
Facial College

2175
01:48:20,352 --> 01:48:21,632
He says this and now he says that

2176
01:48:21,888 --> 01:48:22,656
There's no contest

2177
01:48:23,424 --> 01:48:27,520
He twice in there said that I am 100% genuine

2178
01:48:27,776 --> 01:48:31,360
I am sincere he mentions his family twice in that clip

2179
01:48:31,616 --> 01:48:33,408
Yep he's talking about his trouble too

2180
01:48:33,664 --> 01:48:35,968
Clearly talking about this court case

2181
01:48:36,992 --> 01:48:38,272
Again

2182
01:48:38,784 --> 01:48:42,624
I am very serious about everything except for these time

2183
01:48:43,136 --> 01:48:44,672
But I play characters

2184
01:48:44,928 --> 01:48:47,744
That's going to be a real problem

2185
01:48:48,256 --> 01:48:49,792
So I could he should really take

2186
01:48:51,584 --> 01:48:56,704
Walker Buehler podcast now you're going to be available to testify

2187
01:48:58,240 --> 01:49:02,080
That the end of that clip talked about how they teach college courses about like

2188
01:49:02,336 --> 01:49:03,872
Fake news using his

2189
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:06,688
His stuff

2190
01:49:06,944 --> 01:49:08,480
Good idea

2191
01:49:08,736 --> 01:49:09,504
Absolutely

2192
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:12,064
But then

2193
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:16,416
Can you learn more about fake news knowledge.com

2194
01:49:16,672 --> 01:49:20,768
I think that's a good place to go so this this is our final quest coming up here

2195
01:49:21,024 --> 01:49:22,560
Weaves in

2196
01:49:22,816 --> 01:49:24,096
From that last clip

2197
01:49:24,352 --> 01:49:26,400
And then it is

2198
01:49:28,448 --> 01:49:30,240
I said people who disagree with him

2199
01:49:30,752 --> 01:49:32,800
He said some really funny things

2200
01:49:33,056 --> 01:49:38,432
And then at the end I think he gets into an existential crisis about whether or not he isn't real

2201
01:49:39,712 --> 01:49:43,808
So this whole time

2202
01:49:44,576 --> 01:49:50,720
He doesn't believe he's real well this whole time is we going on. I know it's not so much that

2203
01:49:50,976 --> 01:49:51,744
You'll see you'll see

2204
01:49:53,024 --> 01:49:54,048
They take those now

2205
01:49:54,304 --> 01:49:56,608
They show college kids

2206
01:49:57,120 --> 01:49:59,680
He says this and I saw that there's no contact

2207
01:50:00,448 --> 01:50:01,472
Publix Auburndale

2208
01:50:06,336 --> 01:50:08,640

Infowars.com

2213
01:50:23,232 --> 01:50:26,048
I don't think all the leaders that helped expose Google censoring instead of

2214
01:50:33,728 --> 01:50:34,752

Not physically

2217
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:48,832
Okay

2218
01:50:49,088 --> 01:50:49,600
You understand

Infowars.com porchlight shows project

Play like just the end of that because it starts with the fill your hand

2221
01:51:01,888 --> 01:51:04,448

Physically

2224
01:51:14,432 --> 01:51:14,944
Okay

2225
01:51:15,200 --> 01:51:15,712
You working

2227
01:51:18,016 --> 01:51:19,296
He does not know what he saying

2228
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:21,600
He is all over the map

2229
01:51:22,112 --> 01:51:24,160
10 seconds

2230
01:51:24,672 --> 01:51:25,440
He sang

2231
01:51:26,464 --> 01:51:28,512
Yeah

Metaphors

2233
01:51:39,264 --> 01:51:44,640
Beautiful people attack

2234
01:51:50,528 --> 01:51:53,600
Are we got to get failure hand.

2235
01:51:58,720 --> 01:52:00,512
Jordan

2236
01:52:00,768 --> 01:52:03,840
Has been one of the most arduous episodes we've done

2237
01:52:04,608 --> 01:52:06,144
I don't know why but I do

2238
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:08,192
Somewhere in the middle I lost

2239
01:52:08,960 --> 01:52:10,752
I lost

2240
01:52:11,008 --> 01:52:13,312
I know you cut out like

2241
01:52:13,568 --> 01:52:19,712
Probably at least 45 Clips didn't I lost my interest in talking about this episode

2242
01:52:20,992 --> 01:52:21,760
So

2243
01:52:22,016 --> 01:52:22,528
Bored

2244
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:23,808
By this

2245
01:52:24,064 --> 01:52:27,648
Again great sales pitch

2246
01:52:27,904 --> 01:52:29,440
I'm fascinated by his

2247
01:52:29,952 --> 01:52:35,072
Version of what is real

2248
01:52:35,328 --> 01:52:36,096
4 years

2249
01:52:36,352 --> 01:52:39,424
Like exactly what is the nature of

2250
01:52:39,680 --> 01:52:43,520
Just going to constantly

2251
01:52:43,776 --> 01:52:48,640
Discuss whether or not Chicago professors

2252
01:52:48,896 --> 01:52:51,712
Come in and discuss

2253
01:52:52,992 --> 01:52:55,040
That to me is

2254
01:52:55,296 --> 01:52:56,576
This idea of

2255
01:52:57,600 --> 01:53:02,720
People are attacking me I'm misrepresenting what they're technically about and twisting it into something else

2256
01:53:03,232 --> 01:53:04,000
That's fun

2257
01:53:04,512 --> 01:53:05,792
The Google narrative

2258
01:53:06,048 --> 01:53:07,584
On its own is fairly fun

2259
01:53:08,096 --> 01:53:09,888
But the two of them mixed together

2260
01:53:10,144 --> 01:53:11,424
When we know

2261
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:15,264
That what's underneath so much of it is this divorce

2262
01:53:15,776 --> 01:53:18,592
It's okay for me

2263
01:53:19,872 --> 01:53:21,920
Does he actually believe that

2264
01:53:22,176 --> 01:53:23,712
What they are attacking

2265
01:53:23,968 --> 01:53:24,480
Come on

2266
01:53:24,736 --> 01:53:25,248
Is

2267
01:53:25,504 --> 01:53:26,016
That

2268
01:53:27,808 --> 01:53:28,576
Clip of him dressing

2269
01:53:29,600 --> 01:53:31,392
No

2270
01:53:31,648 --> 01:53:32,160
No

2271
01:53:32,672 --> 01:53:33,952
Right I think

2272
01:53:34,720 --> 01:53:36,000
I think he has a bad lawyer

2273
01:53:36,256 --> 01:53:36,768
Maybe

2274
01:53:37,792 --> 01:53:43,936
He might not have listened to legal advice then cuz

2275
01:53:45,472 --> 01:53:48,032
I think it is Warriors know what's best for him

2276
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:50,080
Use this argument of its

2277
01:53:50,336 --> 01:53:52,640
Performance art as a way to

2278
01:53:52,896 --> 01:53:53,408
It's not

2279
01:53:53,664 --> 01:53:55,200
He's not a performance

2280
01:53:56,736 --> 01:54:00,064
If they are going to bring in Infowars into a

2281
01:54:00,576 --> 01:54:01,600
Divorce

2282
01:54:02,624 --> 01:54:03,392
That's your angle

2283
01:54:03,648 --> 01:54:09,280
It's the only way to use the violent outburst

2284
01:54:10,560 --> 01:54:11,072
Play

2285
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:16,448
To his insecurities about leaving his body but no for Alex

2286
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:18,496
To his audience it doesn't play

2287
01:54:18,752 --> 01:54:21,824
He knows he has to defend himself against

2288
01:54:23,872 --> 01:54:26,688
Again I don't think he could have listened to his lawyer's advice but

2289
01:54:27,200 --> 01:54:29,760
Play both sides of it

2290
01:54:30,016 --> 01:54:31,808
It's a very thin line that he's trying to

2291
01:54:32,064 --> 01:54:32,576
Between

2292
01:54:33,856 --> 01:54:35,392
Performance artist when I do stuff

2293
01:54:35,648 --> 01:54:36,160
You don't like

2294
01:54:36,672 --> 01:54:38,464
And I am a serious person when I do

2295
01:54:38,976 --> 01:54:41,792
You do like nothing that's what he's saying to the court

2296
01:54:42,048 --> 01:54:44,608
Yes but he's saying to his audience

2297
01:54:48,192 --> 01:54:48,960
Dressing up as the

2298
01:54:49,472 --> 01:54:49,984
Yes

2299
01:54:50,240 --> 01:54:51,520
Got time on the rest of the time

2300
01:54:51,776 --> 01:54:54,592
I'm Alex Jones good old classical liberal flash libertarian

2301
01:54:55,104 --> 01:54:55,616
God

2302
01:54:55,872 --> 01:54:56,896
So yeah

2303
01:54:59,968 --> 01:55:00,736
More interesting

2304
01:55:01,504 --> 01:55:03,552
That's way more interesting to me

2305
01:55:04,320 --> 01:55:06,112
Ben even his b*******

2306
01:55:06,368 --> 01:55:08,672
Look up bulshit argument is not that's just

2307
01:55:09,952 --> 01:55:11,232
But I don't want to poke holes in them

2308
01:55:11,488 --> 01:55:12,768
I hope he succeeds

2309
01:55:15,072 --> 01:55:16,864
I don't want his kids being taken away from him

2310
01:55:17,376 --> 01:55:17,888
No

2311
01:55:18,144 --> 01:55:19,168
I don't believe

2312
01:55:19,424 --> 01:55:19,936
They're not back

2313
01:55:20,704 --> 01:55:21,216
Ruler

2314
01:55:22,752 --> 01:55:25,824
My choice to make

2315
01:55:26,336 --> 01:55:29,152
You know I think I know I think it's wrong but it's not my choice

2316
01:55:29,664 --> 01:55:31,200
Right I don't have any evidence

2317
01:55:32,736 --> 01:55:33,760
Said he was abusive

2318
01:55:34,272 --> 01:55:35,552
I don't think you should have his kids

2319
01:55:35,808 --> 01:55:38,624
But there isn't any evidence of that really

2320
01:55:39,136 --> 01:55:42,720
Not that we're aware I don't know that has done doesn't want

2321
01:55:43,232 --> 01:55:43,744
2

2322
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:44,768
Moonlight

2323
01:55:45,024 --> 01:55:46,560
Infowars over the summer

2324
01:55:46,816 --> 01:55:47,840
I don't know what that's not the

2325
01:55:48,352 --> 01:55:52,192
Right when I was 13 14 I would go to my dad's office

2326
01:55:52,704 --> 01:55:54,752
And hang out with him at the University

2327
01:55:55,520 --> 01:55:56,288
So like I don't

2328
01:55:56,800 --> 01:55:58,592
I don't know that his son is any different

2329
01:55:58,848 --> 01:56:04,992
It doesn't want to just go hang out at the Infowars office

2330
01:56:05,248 --> 01:56:11,392
Look like indoctrination but on the other

2331
01:56:13,440 --> 01:56:14,208
Completely innocent

2332
01:56:14,720 --> 01:56:17,536
Look at the indoctrination argument

2333
01:56:17,792 --> 01:56:18,304
F******

2334
01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:20,352
If your parents are Christian they

2335
01:56:23,168 --> 01:56:29,312
Yeah there's a long road to go down

2336
01:56:29,568 --> 01:56:35,200
Kids be taken away from him and if the argument that needs to be made in order for him to keep his kids as it is a performance artist

2337
01:56:35,712 --> 01:56:36,992
Then by all means

2338
01:56:37,248 --> 01:56:37,760
Go for it

2339
01:56:38,784 --> 01:56:44,928
Cuz realistically that is what he's doing and saying you are kind of saying that it is alright

2340
01:56:45,184 --> 01:56:46,208
For him to lie to keep

2341
01:56:46,464 --> 01:56:46,976
Because kids

2342
01:56:47,232 --> 01:56:47,744
Yes

2343
01:56:53,888 --> 01:56:55,168
It is alright to lie

2344
01:56:55,424 --> 01:56:57,472
Because it's not really a lie

2345
01:56:57,984 --> 01:57:01,312
The area of perception

2346
01:57:01,568 --> 01:57:02,336
Wrecked

2347
01:57:02,592 --> 01:57:03,616
Real talk

2348
01:57:03,872 --> 01:57:05,152
He is a performance art

2349
01:57:05,664 --> 01:57:07,200
Inasmuch as he's a propaganda

2350
01:57:07,712 --> 01:57:08,224
Okay

2351
01:57:08,480 --> 01:57:11,040
He is not really necessarily

2352
01:57:11,552 --> 01:57:16,416
All the things that he presents in the argument has to come down to

2353
01:57:16,672 --> 01:57:17,184
Intent

2354
01:57:18,720 --> 01:57:24,864
And that is our conversation

2355
01:57:25,120 --> 01:57:26,656
Ghibli is whether or not

2356
01:57:30,240 --> 01:57:30,752
No

2357
01:57:31,008 --> 01:57:33,056
So if he is a performance artist

2358
01:57:33,312 --> 01:57:33,824
Then he is

2359
01:57:34,336 --> 01:57:35,104
Tending

2360
01:57:35,360 --> 01:57:36,128
To be this in

2361
01:57:36,384 --> 01:57:36,896
Insane

2362
01:57:37,152 --> 01:57:38,176
In order to

2363
01:57:38,944 --> 01:57:40,736
If he is a propagandist

2364
01:57:41,248 --> 01:57:42,528
He isn't ending

2365
01:57:43,040 --> 01:57:43,552
To Duke

2366
01:57:43,808 --> 01:57:44,320
People with this

2367
01:57:46,112 --> 01:57:47,904
He's a believer

2368
01:57:51,232 --> 01:57:52,000
What is that

2369
01:57:52,512 --> 01:57:54,816
Well I mean there are people who sell junk

2370
01:57:55,072 --> 01:57:55,584
Product

2371
01:57:55,840 --> 01:57:59,680
In the world

2372
01:57:59,936 --> 01:58:03,776
People whose entire existence is about selling a shity Prada

2373
01:58:04,032 --> 01:58:10,176
Like I don't think they should have their kids taken away just because they trick people into buying things they don't need

2374
01:58:10,432 --> 01:58:12,224
So it's at the end of the day

2375
01:58:12,480 --> 01:58:13,248
His Auto

2376
01:58:13,504 --> 01:58:14,016
Imagine

2377
01:58:14,784 --> 01:58:15,296
Donald Trump

2378
01:58:17,600 --> 01:58:18,112
Had had

2379
01:58:18,368 --> 01:58:18,880
Donald Trump

2380
01:58:20,416 --> 01:58:20,928
What

2381
01:58:21,696 --> 01:58:22,208
What a better

2382
01:58:22,720 --> 01:58:27,840
Mommy maybe maybe the world we live in is an inevitability and some other rich kid would have ended up being president

2383
01:58:28,096 --> 01:58:31,680
That is a good point be that as it may

2384
01:58:31,936 --> 01:58:32,448
Mozzarella

2385
01:58:34,240 --> 01:58:35,264
I don't think

2386
01:58:35,776 --> 01:58:36,800
Necessarily

2387
01:58:38,080 --> 01:58:38,592
I don't know it's

2388
01:58:38,848 --> 01:58:39,872
It's it's so

2389
01:58:40,128 --> 01:58:40,896
Confusing but like

2390
01:58:41,920 --> 01:58:45,504
Legitimately I believe that he is a real person and at the same time

2391
01:58:45,760 --> 01:58:46,784
He is putting on an act

2392
01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:49,344
So both arguments are kind of true

2393
01:58:49,600 --> 01:58:53,952
In court in order to not have his kids taken away

2394
01:58:54,208 --> 01:58:56,000
Makes total sense to me and I'm not against

2395
01:58:56,512 --> 01:58:58,304
At the same time him coming on the air

2396
01:58:58,560 --> 01:58:59,328
And saying

2397
01:58:59,584 --> 01:59:03,936
I am real this is me it is contradictory to what he saying in court

2398
01:59:04,192 --> 01:59:08,544
Just on its face

2399
01:59:08,800 --> 01:59:11,872
Because he is in his capacity as a performance artist

2400
01:59:12,128 --> 01:59:15,456
That's exactly

2401
01:59:15,712 --> 01:59:16,224
While you were

2402
01:59:16,480 --> 01:59:16,992
Performing

2403
01:59:17,248 --> 01:59:19,040
But you would never say that

2404
01:59:19,296 --> 01:59:20,576
In your real life

2405
01:59:21,088 --> 01:59:24,416
Possibly know untangling that

2406
01:59:24,672 --> 01:59:25,696
Performance artist

2407
01:59:26,464 --> 01:59:30,816
Just like your gordian knot of a microphone cord

2408
01:59:32,352 --> 01:59:34,400
What's more important to me

2409
01:59:35,936 --> 01:59:36,704
I think

2410
01:59:40,032 --> 01:59:42,592
No.

2411
01:59:43,872 --> 01:59:45,664
I don't know what point I want to make here

2412
01:59:46,176 --> 01:59:47,456
I really don't

2413
01:59:48,736 --> 01:59:49,504
I worry

2414
01:59:50,272 --> 01:59:50,784
Not worried

2415
01:59:51,296 --> 01:59:51,808
I am

2416
01:59:52,064 --> 01:59:53,344
Comforted by the fact

2417
01:59:54,880 --> 01:59:55,648
Alex Jones

2418
01:59:56,160 --> 01:59:56,672
Is

2419
01:59:57,952 --> 01:59:58,720
Inscrutable

2420
01:59:59,744 --> 02:00:01,536
Until we can actually

2421
02:00:02,304 --> 02:00:02,816
Spend

2422
02:00:03,072 --> 02:00:04,352
Months upon months

2423
02:00:04,608 --> 02:00:05,376
Talking to Alex

2424
02:00:05,632 --> 02:00:06,144
West Jones

2425
02:00:06,400 --> 02:00:07,168
In a personal setting

2426
02:00:07,424 --> 02:00:13,312
But one day there'll be like we'll do it the jinxed style us.

2427
02:00:13,568 --> 02:00:19,200
Turn everything like everybody involved with Alex

2428
02:00:19,456 --> 02:00:19,968
Because

2429
02:00:21,248 --> 02:00:21,760
Endlessly

2430
02:00:24,320 --> 02:00:25,856
He is

2431
02:00:26,112 --> 02:00:28,416
He's our version of a true crime

2432
02:00:28,672 --> 02:00:32,512
Go back through

2433
02:00:33,024 --> 02:00:33,536
You know

2434
02:00:33,792 --> 02:00:35,840
Serial killers life and go back to

2435
02:00:36,096 --> 02:00:36,608
Through step-by-step

2436
02:00:36,864 --> 02:00:37,888
How all of this crap

2437
02:00:38,144 --> 02:00:38,656
Primeweld

2438
02:00:39,424 --> 02:00:40,192
Where this guy

2439
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:43,264
What kind of and there's always that element

2440
02:00:43,520 --> 02:00:44,544
In a Serial Killer's life

2441
02:00:44,800 --> 02:00:45,824
You look at their childhood

2442
02:00:46,080 --> 02:00:48,128
Can you go

2443
02:00:48,384 --> 02:00:48,896
Yeah

2444
02:00:49,152 --> 02:00:51,456
There's always that point

2445
02:00:52,224 --> 02:00:52,992
Alex Jones

2446
02:00:54,272 --> 02:00:55,040
Serial killer

2447
02:00:55,552 --> 02:00:56,064
That

2448
02:00:56,576 --> 02:00:59,648
Is is expressing his serial-killing in a different

2449
02:01:00,160 --> 02:01:01,952
So he's a very fascinating

2450
02:01:02,208 --> 02:01:03,488
Figure that is both

2451
02:01:05,280 --> 02:01:06,304
Empathetic

2452
02:01:06,816 --> 02:01:09,120
And monstrous to a degree where you

2453
02:01:09,376 --> 02:01:09,888
You think

2454
02:01:10,656 --> 02:01:12,960
How can this happen to a human being

2455
02:01:13,216 --> 02:01:14,240
And at the same time

2456
02:01:14,496 --> 02:01:16,544
Which human being should not be allowed to

2457
02:01:17,056 --> 02:01:17,568
Anywhere near us

2458
02:01:18,592 --> 02:01:19,872
Because they're a monster

2459
02:01:20,128 --> 02:01:24,736
Push poll of what is wrong with it

2460
02:01:26,528 --> 02:01:30,624
Android a part of me that is like maybe the most cynical part of me

2461
02:01:31,136 --> 02:01:33,440
Wonders if he drops in those little pieces

2462
02:01:33,696 --> 02:01:34,208
Is about his

2463
02:01:34,976 --> 02:01:35,744
Tragic life

2464
02:01:36,512 --> 02:01:38,048
And doesn't present them as tragic

2465
02:01:38,304 --> 02:01:40,096
In order to make people like us

2466
02:01:40,864 --> 02:01:42,912
Pick an empathic

2467
02:01:43,168 --> 02:01:47,520
Is too cynical for me

2468
02:01:47,776 --> 02:01:53,152
That is one here's my problem you know what that would be a great performance

2469
02:01:53,664 --> 02:01:57,504
Kafka's the Hunger Artist

2470
02:01:59,040 --> 02:02:00,576
I'm not going to

2471
02:02:00,832 --> 02:02:02,112
Deny that based on my cell

2472
02:02:03,136 --> 02:02:04,672
I'm going to die that based on

2473
02:02:05,184 --> 02:02:06,976
The genius level Talent

2474
02:02:07,232 --> 02:02:07,744
Would require

2475
02:02:08,256 --> 02:02:09,280
To drop in those

2476
02:02:09,792 --> 02:02:13,632
At certain intervals for such a short. Of time

2477
02:02:14,144 --> 02:02:14,656
And in such a

2478
02:02:14,912 --> 02:02:18,240
Genuine when you're struggling

2479
02:02:18,496 --> 02:02:21,056
Story of his mom kicking them off Ernie

2480
02:02:21,312 --> 02:02:22,080
That's true

2481
02:02:23,360 --> 02:02:24,896
Regardless of whether or not

2482
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:26,432
To him

2483
02:02:26,944 --> 02:02:27,456
That is a

2484
02:02:27,712 --> 02:02:28,736
A formative moment

2485
02:02:32,064 --> 02:02:35,904
Maybe the Rosetta Stone like we said it it kind of unlock the whole lot

2486
02:02:41,792 --> 02:02:42,304
The

2487
02:02:42,816 --> 02:02:44,608
The stuff that's going on with his divorce

2488
02:02:45,120 --> 02:02:45,888
Is tragic

2489
02:02:46,656 --> 02:02:48,704
For all parties involved especially the kids

2490
02:02:51,776 --> 02:02:52,544
We should not

2491
02:02:58,688 --> 02:03:00,480
Let's try as a society

2492
02:03:00,736 --> 02:03:02,016
To resist the urge to Moc

2493
02:03:02,784 --> 02:03:03,296
About this

2494
02:03:04,064 --> 02:03:04,576
Stuff

2495
02:03:04,832 --> 02:03:05,600
Mock him

2496
02:03:05,856 --> 02:03:07,648
For what he deserves to be mocked for

2497
02:03:08,416 --> 02:03:10,976
We in this episode have mocked him about his lies

2498
02:03:11,488 --> 02:03:12,768
Go to come straight out of his mouth

2499
02:03:13,280 --> 02:03:16,352
We've marked him about him not understanding satire

2500
02:03:16,864 --> 02:03:17,888
And we've marked him

2501
02:03:18,400 --> 02:03:21,216
For saying things that are going to end up in court

2502
02:03:23,776 --> 02:03:25,824
Wilshire will space.

2503
02:03:28,128 --> 02:03:29,664
Are great they're fun they're fun

2504
02:03:34,016 --> 02:03:34,528
Really

2505
02:03:34,784 --> 02:03:37,088
Does it also makes

2506
02:03:38,624 --> 02:03:39,136
The divorce

2507
02:03:39,392 --> 02:03:39,904
Yeah

2508
02:03:40,416 --> 02:03:41,184
Manchester

2509
02:03:41,440 --> 02:03:41,952
Cheapest kids

2510
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:45,536
His wife has been

2511
02:03:47,072 --> 02:03:48,352
Custody multiple times

2512
02:03:49,120 --> 02:03:50,400
Suggest there's something else going

2513
02:03:50,656 --> 02:03:55,264
No

2514
02:03:55,520 --> 02:03:57,824
We can only speculate

2515
02:03:58,848 --> 02:04:00,640
We can't know did well right

2516
02:04:00,896 --> 02:04:04,992
I meant is that as a as a culture

2517
02:04:05,504 --> 02:04:08,064
Like the first thing I

2518
02:04:08,320 --> 02:04:11,136
The first thing that I felt whenever I read about his

2519
02:04:11,648 --> 02:04:12,160
His cup

2520
02:04:13,184 --> 02:04:13,952
Was not

2521
02:04:14,208 --> 02:04:17,280
Oh he called himself a performance artist is

2522
02:04:18,304 --> 02:04:20,608
Based on all the stuff that we've talked about

2523
02:04:20,864 --> 02:04:21,632
And all the stuff

2524
02:04:22,144 --> 02:04:22,656
That Weaver

2525
02:04:24,192 --> 02:04:25,472
He might be a good dad

2526
02:04:28,800 --> 02:04:29,312
I felt

2527
02:04:29,568 --> 02:04:30,592
Forum

2528
02:04:31,104 --> 02:04:31,872
Maybe

2529
02:04:32,640 --> 02:04:38,784
Maybe he is a good dad you know it's getting that we do a podcast about him being a propaganda

2530
02:04:39,296 --> 02:04:40,064
And we hate him

2531
02:04:40,576 --> 02:04:46,720
But at the same time everybody else heard this news couldn't wait to tee off and make fun of him about stuff

2532
02:04:46,976 --> 02:04:48,512
And immediate response

2533
02:04:48,768 --> 02:04:49,280
Was

2534
02:04:49,536 --> 02:04:51,584
You thinking he's possibly a good dad

2535
02:04:52,096 --> 02:04:55,424
Admir I mean obviously my first thought was before kids

2536
02:04:55,680 --> 02:04:57,984
Yeah because it drawn out for years

2537
02:05:02,080 --> 02:05:04,128
Running I hate children

2538
02:05:06,176 --> 02:05:08,736
My immediate thought was

2539
02:05:11,552 --> 02:05:12,064
It wasn't

2540
02:05:13,088 --> 02:05:13,600
Joy

2541
02:05:14,112 --> 02:05:17,952
No it wasn't like I can't wait to make fun of this

2542
02:05:18,464 --> 02:05:19,744
It does not make me feel good

2543
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:23,840
I've gotten more messages about this

2544
02:05:24,096 --> 02:05:29,984
Anything that ever happened to me

2545
02:05:31,008 --> 02:05:32,288
That's not home

2546
02:05:33,824 --> 02:05:37,408
There's no real possible winners

2547
02:05:37,664 --> 02:05:39,712
Matter who wins this court case it doesn't

2548
02:05:40,224 --> 02:05:40,736
Like

2549
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:44,576
Alex Jones still has to be Alex Jones for the rest of his life

2550
02:05:44,832 --> 02:05:47,648
He's never going to get help no matter what how

2551
02:05:48,672 --> 02:05:50,208
Here's the better speculation

2552
02:05:50,464 --> 02:05:50,976
For you and I

2553
02:05:51,232 --> 02:05:51,744
Alright

2554
02:05:53,536 --> 02:05:55,840
If this is what takes him down

2555
02:05:57,632 --> 02:05:58,912
Is that a net positive

2556
02:06:02,240 --> 02:06:08,384
Like is it doesn't do well ultimately this is the To The Ends justify the means

2557
02:06:08,896 --> 02:06:09,664
Your argument is

2558
02:06:09,920 --> 02:06:10,432
Is based on

2559
02:06:11,200 --> 02:06:11,968
False presumption

2560
02:06:12,224 --> 02:06:12,736
Because it won't Bend

2561
02:06:13,760 --> 02:06:15,040
This is nothing

2562
02:06:15,296 --> 02:06:15,808
Rippetoe

2563
02:06:16,064 --> 02:06:19,904
Take his money away take all of his stuff away take his kids away breaks him as a man

2564
02:06:21,440 --> 02:06:21,952
I want

2565
02:06:23,488 --> 02:06:24,768
That's not our speculation

2566
02:06:25,024 --> 02:06:26,048
I know but

2567
02:06:26,304 --> 02:06:26,816
No

2568
02:06:28,352 --> 02:06:29,632
I don't think

2569
02:06:31,168 --> 02:06:34,496
But I mean I guess what it comes down to is no the end wouldn't justify the

2570
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:38,848
He should be taking down for being a propagandist the monster

2571
02:06:39,360 --> 02:06:40,896
Someone who has

2572
02:06:41,408 --> 02:06:42,432
Incited violence

2573
02:06:43,968 --> 02:06:44,736
Was damaged

2574
02:06:45,504 --> 02:06:47,040
Snot

2575
02:06:47,552 --> 02:06:48,320
More lies

2576
02:06:48,576 --> 02:06:51,904
But he should be taken down for

2577
02:06:52,160 --> 02:06:52,672
.

2578
02:06:52,928 --> 02:06:54,720
The fact that in his trial

2579
02:06:55,232 --> 02:06:56,512
He's trying to defend himself

2580
02:06:58,304 --> 02:07:00,608
Nazis who were good parents

2581
02:07:02,144 --> 02:07:02,656
At

2582
02:07:02,912 --> 02:07:04,704
True

2583
02:07:04,960 --> 02:07:07,520
Completely evil people who love their kids

2584
02:07:08,288 --> 02:07:11,616
They raise them in systems that led them

2585
02:07:12,128 --> 02:07:13,664
Possibly also be nosey

2586
02:07:14,688 --> 02:07:15,200
Christian's again

2587
02:07:15,456 --> 02:07:17,504
Shirts

2588
02:07:19,040 --> 02:07:19,552
I just ate

2589
02:07:19,808 --> 02:07:21,856
I hate the idea of

2590
02:07:22,624 --> 02:07:27,488
A custody battle being played out publicly first of all events second of all

2591
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,560
Hate being used as some sort of punitive thing

2592
02:07:31,328 --> 02:07:34,912
Like I would hate the idea of society treating it like

2593
02:07:35,168 --> 02:07:37,472
You've done on the air

2594
02:07:37,984 --> 02:07:40,032
Here's your punishment you don't get your kids

2595
02:07:40,800 --> 02:07:41,568
That is a bummer

2596
02:07:41,824 --> 02:07:42,592
That's horrible

2597
02:07:43,104 --> 02:07:45,152
I don't think a lot of people feel that way

2598
02:07:45,664 --> 02:07:46,432
Anatomy

2599
02:07:47,456 --> 02:07:49,504
Like as much as I hate Alex I hate that

2600
02:07:50,016 --> 02:07:51,296
Safeway Morris

2601
02:07:51,552 --> 02:07:52,064
Cuz that

2602
02:07:53,088 --> 02:07:54,624
Here's here's the weirdest thing

2603
02:07:56,160 --> 02:07:58,208
Well this is the most

2604
02:07:58,464 --> 02:07:59,232
Novelistic

2605
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:01,792
Nobody hates Alex Jones

2606
02:08:02,048 --> 02:08:03,328
Sounds more than we do

2607
02:08:04,608 --> 02:08:05,120
More

2608
02:08:05,376 --> 02:08:06,144
Accurate reason

2609
02:08:06,912 --> 02:08:09,216
At the same time right now it feels like

2610
02:08:10,240 --> 02:08:12,544
We're the only people who emphasized

2611
02:08:13,568 --> 02:08:16,128
Cuz I don't think his listeners are empathizing with that

2612
02:08:16,384 --> 02:08:18,688
I think they're saying that it's a conspiracy against

2613
02:08:18,944 --> 02:08:22,528
General that's what I've got

2614
02:08:24,064 --> 02:08:24,576
Like us

2615
02:08:25,600 --> 02:08:29,696
I mean I think on one level we might be the only people who care about him

2616
02:08:38,400 --> 02:08:40,192
Under the death penalty

2617
02:08:45,056 --> 02:08:49,152
But like yeah I think there's a decent chance that we're the only people who have

2618
02:08:49,920 --> 02:08:51,200
A robot

2619
02:08:51,968 --> 02:08:53,248
Fair perspective on him

2620
02:08:53,760 --> 02:08:54,272
Anyway

2621
02:08:54,528 --> 02:08:55,552
Sorry

2622
02:08:56,064 --> 02:09:02,208
Sorry we didn't talk about fun a divorce

2623
02:09:02,464 --> 02:09:05,280
S*** but you can go find that at every other website

2624
02:09:05,536 --> 02:09:11,168
You didn't come to us for the same ship other people

2625
02:09:11,424 --> 02:09:13,472
Video will probably be taken down from the internet

2626
02:09:13,728 --> 02:09:14,240
At some point

2627
02:09:14,752 --> 02:09:17,568
If anyone with anyone smart

2628
02:09:17,824 --> 02:09:18,848
I think Alex

2629
02:09:19,104 --> 02:09:24,992
Might be off the air for the next few days I would assume that is Laura's be like Joseph Watson

2630
02:09:31,648 --> 02:09:37,792
