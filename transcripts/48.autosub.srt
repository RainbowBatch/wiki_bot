And talk about the light

4
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:18,688
The good hobo Alex Jones

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,480

00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:36,096
Shephard's Resort

8
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:37,632
This is a non-alcoholic

9
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:39,680
Sparkling sangria

10
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:40,448
Dreading

11
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:41,984
Yeah this cannot be

12
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:43,520
Ur10

13
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:45,824
Your first step and we have

14
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:49,152
It's not good

15
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:54,528
Arizona surprise

16
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:58,368
Look terrible

17
00:00:58,624 --> 00:00:59,904
Undrinkable

18
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,440
Okay

19
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:03,232
It's Pleasant is what I would say

20
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:05,280
Things that are Pleasant

21
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:06,304
Lucky

22
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,376
Stewart

23
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:11,168
Awful I think it's

24
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:12,704
Neutral

25
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:17,824
Nutrislice

26
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,104

Davis

30
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:37,792
Absolutely we're going to get to our episode for today but before

31
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:38,816
I'm going to

32
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:40,608
Two are out of context.

33
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:52,896
So we're going to be going over today which is

34
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:53,664
Two things

35
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,688
Are indirect

36
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:55,712
Opposition

37
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,880
On the May 31st episode

38
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:04,416
Over today

39
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:11,072
Alex Jones is about to do an interview with Megyn Kelly

40
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:11,840
She's a pretty girl

41
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:15,168
He is cold her horrible names

42
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:17,984
Considerate

43
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:23,872
She said about her and parents mostly better.

44
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,968
Do ugly for a fox

45
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30,016
Her friend said

46
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:33,856
He probably tells

47
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:39,232
So yeah Alex Jones has long thing for months

48
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:43,328
I'm not doing any more interviews unless their lives

49
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:45,376
Unless I have control over the edit

50
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:49,472
I'm at now you sitting down with Rodger Stone on this episode today and he's like

51
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:53,056
I know whatever they want but

52
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,592
I'm going to do it

53
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:03,808
Look National TV is not bad man

54
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:06,368
It is if you claim that your principles or against

55
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:08,160
Being all people shows for no reason

56
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,696
And if you argue that hey

57
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:13,536
They're dying media I reach 50 million people a week

58
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,840
Hey Annie press

59
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,632
Is hypocritical press

60
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,168
The meaning of that

61
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:21,216
May 31st

62
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:23,776
Yes that is the Wednesday

63
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:30,176
Here this week we're back in the present after we have been embarking on our investigation last couple episodes

64
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,968
Hope you guys have enjoyed that would

65
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,784
But now we're back in the present

66
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:39,648
If you recall

67
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,672
13

68
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:42,720
The end of last week on Thursday

69
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,512
Alex Jones drop

70
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,304
The Jerome corsi

71
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:52,192
His friend

72
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:55,520
Sorry sorry

73
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:57,056
You survived the weekend

74
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,848
And the reason for that

75
00:03:59,104 --> 00:03:59,616
Is surprising

76
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:01,920
Some people is it on Thursday Alex

77
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,712
Found information

78
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:05,504
That was bigger than Watergate

79
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,552
I probably would get him killed

80
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,856
So

81
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,392
Must be just a

82
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,160
Bombshell

83
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:14,976
No plug is there a reason I didn't read about

84
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,256
What is bigger than Watergate

85
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:18,047
Play Scandal on Twitter

86
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:22,143

00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:26,495
What is the

89
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,263
All right if this

90
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,287

Alright please just punch yourself

93
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:44,159
Tuesday comes around on Monday Memorial Day

94
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:47,487
Actually what they did do something I've never seen them do before

95
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:50,303
Alex put together like an 8-hour best of

96
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,095
No

97
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,631
Which

98
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,679
Yeah kind of gives me the strength

99
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,215
Best of what

100
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:01,055
I don't even I don't even I didn't watch it I just thought I'd existed

101
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:06,687
I wasn't going to watch that I don't know

102
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:07,967
Possibly it's

103
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:12,319
The same still that you tweeted out for 8 hours

104
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:18,719
Portland

00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:19,743
Hexagon picture

It never will

108
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:26,399
Tuesday comes around like

109
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,679
Holy Ship

And whatever work I listen to it live

114
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,663
Because it's really funny

115
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,223
How Alex Jones comes in commercial singing

116
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,783
They cut that out of the rebroadcast

117
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,063
And I enjoy it

118
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,087
So I listen live

119
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:48,415

It streaming live

122
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:56,095
If the show is streaming but there is no show

123
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,887
There's nobody there it's just commercial

124
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:59,423
Nobody's even talk

125
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,447
It's just commercial

126
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,727
Special Report

127
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,799
And then every now and again the announcer voice

128
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:05,823

Your house

131
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,967
Alex Jones

132
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:13,247
Another commercial

133
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:16,319
Okay well he went 34 minutes

134
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,599
With nothing

135
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,903
What the f*** is going on

136
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:22,719
To the point where I was pretty sure I'll expect a Zonda

137
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,279
Great

138
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:27,327
King story that that was what

139
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:30,911

00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:31,935
Alex

141
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,471
Insinuating

142
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,263
On the Wednesday show

143
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,799
There on Tuesday he was in court

144
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,615
And he wants some big victory about his cut

145
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,943
There's no.

146
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,271
Because it was so good for him but no one wants to report it

147
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,671
34 minutes in Rodger Stone

148
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:55,231
I'd like a substitute teacher

149
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,023
You just played videos

150
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,047
Tire time

151
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,327
It's just like

152
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:03,167
Nice report

153
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,959
Let's go to it

154
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:06,751
So you're telling me

155
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:09,823
That Alex Jones apparently was in

156
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,591
Court

157
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,383
Apparently

158
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,943
No one knew about

159
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:18,783
Nothing

160
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,319
No

161
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:25,183
They were just all sitting at Rob do is sitting behind the ones into the hot pile

162
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,535
And court is not something that

163
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:33,631
Jumps out at you know about it ahead of time so why would I

164
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:38,495
Planet video of Jerome corsi's information on the nose

165
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,591
It's such b*******

166
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:44,383
It's wonderful it's so fake

167
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,711
Cuz it basically puts it takes him off the hook

168
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:53,087
He was even there right but that's part of the information he did show up

169
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:55,647
Course you did

170
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:57,183
ATI no new information

171
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,999

173
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,119
It was nothing

174
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,655
It was absolutely nothing

175
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:08,959
Rodger Stone interview

176
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:10,239
Exam

177
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,031
The craziest thing in the world

178
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:15,359
For a good half-hour of the show

179
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,895
Which is mind you

180
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:20,991
Supposed to be the one that you're going to Michelle's

181
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:23,295
Rodger Stone interview

182
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,063

1

189
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:47,359
Hulk Hogan around

190
00:08:54,015 --> 00:09:00,159
He pays Derringer to follow behind it with a guitar that Rick Derringer is

191
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,463
Very bitter but it's Hulk Hogan

192
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,999
Theme song

193
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,023

00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:10,655
Most famous were pro wrestlers theme song

196
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:11,935
Very bitter

197
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,215
Very better

198
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:17,567
Here's why

199
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,335
Okay

200
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:23,711
Rick Derringer believe the Earth is flat or some s*** like that

201
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:25,759
I wish I would be more interested

202
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,807
Rick Derringer claims

203
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:33,183
That Barack Obama

204
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,463
A newspaper

205
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:36,511
This is the part 1

206
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:37,279
This is

207
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:38,815
His source

208
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:39,839
Yeah okay

209
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:47,775
An imaginary will remember when Barack Obama and Donald Trump had a meeting

210
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:50,591
Won the election is very Bittersweet for all

211
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,895
Rick Derringer says

212
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,991
Part of the meeting

213
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:03,391
Was Barack Obama's ass Donald Trump using the real American song

214
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,975
Because Barack Obama felt some sort of acclaim

215
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,279
Because he used it on a campaign before

216
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,583
I don't know if this happened

217
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,887
I don't care to look into

218
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:15,679
Also

219
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:19,775
All the presidents

220
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,823
Teddy

221
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,895
Why would it go that direction

222
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:26,687
I have no idea

223
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:29,759
Trump with dancing Obama about using that song

224
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:30,783
Years ago

225
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:33,087
Probably

226
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:38,975
Rick Derringer hears this news

227
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:39,999
It gets worse

228
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,279
Rick Dicker

229
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,559
Snooze

230
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,327
How do you like

231
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,631
I cannot let this stand

232
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:47,423
Barack Obama is so malleable

233
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:51,263
So he decides to do in his mouth

234
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:57,663
She's going to write a new version

235
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,943
A real American

236
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,223
Just for Trump

237
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:05,087
Time Trump meets with Barack Obama he can be like I got my own version

238
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:08,415
Derringer

239
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:12,511
Correct answer to that

240
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:15,839
Licensing fees

241
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:20,959
Yeah like they play the music video for his new version

242
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:23,775
And it starts with him and some other guy in a car

243
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,055
Talking about birth

244
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:26,847
So

245
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,383
You know that's where we're starting

246
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,663
So they play the song

247
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,223
Play Play the song

248
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:34,783
Rodger Stone to talk about greatest song it is

249
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:39,903
And I

250
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,951
I was freaking out

251
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:45,279
Felt like like

252
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,815
Is this an alternate

253
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,863
Really thought it might be like

254
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,399
Is this an episode from like

255
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,191
Six months ago they're just

256
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,215
Replaying

257
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:54,751
Like I can't be

258
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:58,591
The big bombshell episode

259
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:00,639
When people believe the big boot

260
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:03,711
Devastating

261
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:04,735
So

262
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:08,575
Rick Derringer starts talking about how he cried when he wrote that song

263
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,879
Wow this is great

264
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,159
Rick brought

265
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:13,951
A producer friend with him

266
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:18,047
Who directed of documentary

267
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:24,703
Alex Jones

268
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,543
Language

269
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,567
To dream in that language

270
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,639
So you brought a producer friend along

271
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:38,271
And this guy made a documentary about how if you really look at the Bible it predicted Trump

272
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:39,807
Yeah

273
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:42,367
Working after watch that documentary

274
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:45,695
Documentary

275
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:47,487
One the Bible predicted a lot of

276
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:50,815
And the ones that come in a lot of their

277
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,887
That mirror Trump's rise art

278
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,167
Knock their dark

279
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,191
They're very dark

280
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:59,519
So not to be outdone by these two

281
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,287
Very

282
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:01,567
Ghetto

283
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,103
Soft interview

284
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:03,871
Right

285
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,919
Rodger Stone goes on to

286
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,967
Interview Rick Derringer

287
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:11,039
Who is Olsen

288
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,319
And I have a clip from that

289
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,647
Rookie back

290
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,695
It's an interview

291
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:22,559
With Rick derringers wife

292
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:28,959
Rick derringers wife in her own right I'm not entirely sure what her deal is but anyway listen to this

293
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:35,359
In the studio

294
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:40,991
The real American

295
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,015
Very proud

296
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:48,415
What is so I told Rick and from them

297
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:54,047
He said it's too late then I came up with the idea of having Space Odyssey

298
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:56,095
Come in first before

299
00:13:56,351 --> 00:14:02,495
The song and it did come in just ride and our drummer said yes that sounds really good this way and

300
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:08,895
It also exits with that

301
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:10,431
Songs that I find

302
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,735
Once you listen to it once

303
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:19,135
Kill me I keep thinking about it

304
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,183
It's got that kind of catchy

305
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:26,303
Rick to it

306
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,167
Rick derringers wife is claiming that she is the reason

307
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:35,263
Spake zarathustra

308
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,079
2001

309
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:46,527
Is very 8280

310
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,159
Now it's

311
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:56,255
Exactly the right amount of 11

312
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,095
What time Uganda now

313
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:00,863
Keeping your boot

314
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:01,631
Oh

315
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:03,935
Second Amendment

316
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:11,871
From my feet so the Tuesday show was a completely bizarre

317
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:12,639
Who is Lucinda jenney

318
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:13,663
Yes

319
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,199
Because

320
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,479
What happened is

321
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:18,015
Last week

322
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,599
I forgot his name for a sec

323
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:25,951
Jerome corsi came on the show

324
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:28,255
He wanted a new man

325
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,047
In order to fight the fall

326
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:32,095
The quote false Russian mirror

327
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:37,727
But he called them as well

328
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,263
From their perspective

329
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:41,823
So the first propaganda game

330
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:42,847
But they played

331
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:43,871
What's this

332
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,151
Jerome corsi

333
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:47,199
Is going to get killed this weekend

334
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:48,735
Big news

335
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:51,039
Ben Alex isn't even in studio

336
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:53,343
They do this horseshit on the Tuesday show

337
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,111
Pretend

338
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,647
That they never said

339
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,927
The stuff that they said on Thursday

340
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:59,487
They just rely on people forgetting

341
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:01,791
They pretended Jerome corsi life wasn't

342
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:03,327
The Never

343
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:06,143
That's why you can't have Alex in there cuz if Alex talks

344
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,167
Jerome corsi

345
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:09,215
Eventually Alex

346
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,287
Because of course he has

347
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,335
I'm going to guess if that's the case

348
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:18,943
What everything I can tell the stories that we

349
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,783
Speculated were what he was talking about it appears that those are

350
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,063
What is

351
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:24,831
News world

352
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:27,647
Those are stories that are picking up on like

353
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:28,671
The

354
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:29,695
Right wing

355
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:34,047
Sikeston read itself

356
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,839
Did not

357
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:38,655
The 31st

358
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,567
I want to find

359
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:49,151
Well now

360
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,431
Prison in Concord

361
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:00,159
S*** but it's

362
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,695
Really not

363
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:04,767
We get to Wednesday 8

364
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:07,583
Alex

365
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,143
Decided

366
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,167
To ignore

367
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:11,935
Thursday

368
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:14,495
Ignore the entire course

369
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:16,543
Plotline that they were trying to go with

370
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,591
I'm starting entirely

371
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,615
As it were

372
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,479
Or Tuesday

373
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,527
And talk to Shay

374
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:27,807
Shut the bed

375
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:28,831
And then

376
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,367
Does he come back

377
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:31,647
He's not on this app

378
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,671
Not on Wednesday

379
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,975
No

380
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:41,631
On this episode on Wednesday we got Owen Shroyer sitting in for a little bit

381
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,655
We won't have to listen to him

382
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:45,471
Goodbye we got the big baby

383
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:50,591
Mike cernovich Plays very heavily into this episode

384
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,407
Decided

385
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:57,247
Did they have a new narrative going to go off on and they think it's

386
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,015
Like this

387
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,295
Lightning in a bottle

388
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,319
And it's worth

389
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:05,695
Ignoring the idea that Jerome corsi literally had information that would blow up

390
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:08,255
Gamewright that is like

391
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:12,863
He had a new storylines so amazing that it could get them all killed

392
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,655
No no

393
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:17,215
Otter bulshit

394
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:20,543
Jerome corsi the way they presented

395
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,871
He had the information that would be the culmination of Alex Jones

396
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:24,895
His 20-year career

397
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:29,247
This would be what blows the lid off the globalist they can't deny it

398
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:31,039
So we're going to have to kill Jerome corsi

399
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:33,599
They have ignored that in

400
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:34,623
Hireling

401
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:35,391
Holy

402
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,951
And it's not like he wasn't there

403
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:39,487
You could have said whatever he wanted

404
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:42,559
He had clearance on Tuesday to give out all the information

405
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:47,679
Course I'm going with him there

406
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:50,751
So here's what they do on Wednesday and it's a pivot

407
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,287
Hard pivot

408
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,311
Now

409
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:54,335
Siri

410
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,127
The globalist

411
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,407
No

412
00:18:57,663 --> 00:19:00,479
The globalist

413
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:04,575
The Godfather

414
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,879
Right

415
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,671
Nintendo switch

416
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:11,487
Exactly

417
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:20,191
Nothing's going to be beat that on Wednesday

418
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,727
Literally have the show starts

419
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:28,639
1984 is 1776

420
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:35,039
Alex Jones Show

421
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:38,111
American worldwide

422
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:55,007
I don't care I don't care

423
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:00,639
So

424
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:06,783
I can't begin to describe how hard I don't care about Kathy Griffin holding up

425
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:07,551
A severed Trump head

426
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:08,575
I don't give a

427
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:10,623
I could care less

428
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:12,671
I hope I don't care

429
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:16,767
I don't know why people are talking about

430
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,047
Who cares

431
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:20,863
No one care Griffith

432
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:29,823
What why am I seeing why am I seeing people if with liberals like on

433
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,103
All the site that's like

434
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:33,407
Liberals condemn this act

435
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:35,199
How about I don't care

436
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,991
No it's

437
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,527
From the people that I listen

438
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:39,807
And I respect

439
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:43,135
Who gives a f***

440
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:48,511
But not like

441
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:49,791
Kathy Griffin

442
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:57,215
She's Irrelevant in a shocking thing for attention

443
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:58,239
Obvious

444
00:20:58,751 --> 00:20:59,263
Everyone

445
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:01,055
Who's ever been on that side

446
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,151
That's

447
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:06,175
Ridiculous

448
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,199
No one has been like

449
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:07,967
Yeah alright

450
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:13,087
Operator

451
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:14,623
Yeah alright

452
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:18,208
Now you're a man

453
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,072
Exactly

454
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:26,912
Is operating with a couple of flawed premises

455
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:29,472
The first of the Kathy Griffin is super relevant

456
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,008
Which is not true

457
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:40,224
I love I love Kathy Griffin's career it's been amazing she's been able to get to this like level of Fame where

458
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:46,624
Enough people recognized early years ago she had a show called my life on the d-list

459
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,744
New Year's New Year's Eve with Ryan Seacrest

460
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:55,072
Not anymore

461
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:58,912
Step into the Joan Rivers roll

462
00:21:59,168 --> 00:21:59,680
Something she

463
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:03,520
Here's the second flawed premise that Alex is operating under

464
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:06,592
Anyone is going to defend Kathy Griffin

465
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:10,688
But this is going to be

466
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:12,480
The biggest beetle in the world

467
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:16,320
Little does he know by the time he starts broadcasting

468
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:17,856
She had already been fire

469
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:22,464
Vietnam head already fired over New Year's Eve

470
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:25,792
Of course you can't do s*** like that

471
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:27,328
It's it's bad

472
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:28,608
For the brand

473
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:32,704
Yeah you're the reason that O'Reilly's

474
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:38,336
Another reason why I don't care about what

475
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,360
Undead yes it is

476
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,408
So anyway

477
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:47,040
Going a very interesting Journey with this this episode

478
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:48,320
And if it was just

479
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:50,624
Like I'm mad about Kathy Griffin

480
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:51,904
I would be like

481
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:52,928
Not do this at the

482
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,512
Yeah I wouldn't be into that

483
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:59,584
It would be very boring because I would just go on a lot of rain

484
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,888
Explaining how I don't care

485
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:03,936
But

486
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:04,960
It's important

487
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:05,728
Because

488
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:07,008
The weight

489
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:08,800
This is

490
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:10,080
The neck

491
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:11,104
Distraction mean

492
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,384
This is

493
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,432
Jerome corsi branded

494
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:16,992
Take attention away from Russia

495
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:24,672
They Sorry boss I blew it

496
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:28,000
I get it I'm bored and go hang out with crnkovich I guess I get it

497
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:29,792
So here is a Alex

498
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:30,816
Next

499
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:32,352
This is the problem

500
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:33,888
But the globalist

501
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:34,912
And the liberal

502
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,568
Also privately talked about about it

503
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,616
Friends and family

504
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:50,016
The whole Russia narrative the whole Trump

505
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:56,160
Push poles

506
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:59,232
Trump is going up in scientific poll

507
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:03,840
With everything there.

508
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:06,656
They have committed so many

509
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,448
Just absolutely

510
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:14,848
Massive distortions and lies

511
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:15,872
Massive

512
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,456
That they are now discredited

513
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:22,016
I've been committed so much illegal leak

514
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:30,976
So about the Russian stuff

515
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:34,048
Call me is going to testify next week

516
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,008
Yeah the reason why he

517
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:45,056
Said he couldn't testify in open court

518
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,080
Legal protect

519
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:48,128
Do you have to get clearance

520
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:49,408
2 in order

521
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:51,456
To say the things that he's going to say

522
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:52,992
From all sources that

523
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:54,528
Disgusted

524
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:55,296
He's going

525
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:56,320
To discuss the obstruction

526
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:59,648
You can't talk about the ongoing

527
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:00,416
Best vacation stop

528
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:04,256
His investigation

529
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,536
He got the green light

530
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:06,304
Just yesterday

531
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:07,840
From you

532
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:12,192
Okay keep the two

533
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:14,752
That's what's been holding it up

534
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:17,312
And that's why he was supposed to go into like June

535
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:20,896
Before he would be able to testify

536
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:24,480
So by next week is supposed to be in front of the house intelligence

537
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:27,040
You got the green light

538
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:30,368
I just don't trust anything

539
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:36,000
Yeah

540
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:37,024
It's stupid

541
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,072
To get excited about anything in

542
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:40,608
What will be will be

543
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:41,376
Then we'll see

544
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:42,400
But

545
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:46,752
The idea that Trump is surging in the polls is insane

546
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:53,664
Right now 4.8 disapproval rating all of the

547
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:57,504
Combined average

548
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,552
39.1 approval rating

549
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,856
4.8 disapproval

550
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:04,672
The only pull that he's going up in is the calls for him

551
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:05,440
Repeat

552
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:11,840
Say he's at like 43% now

553
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:13,376
Up from 38 last week

554
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:15,168
The 5% jump

555
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,192
In a week

556
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:17,216
People who want

557
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:18,496
Impeachment to begin

558
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,288
You should be gone

559
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,336
Yep

560
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:24,640
Yeah we still doing this

561
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:25,408
I don't know

562
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:26,176
Guys

563
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:28,480
Let's stop torturing ourselves

564
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:31,040
Pull up just come on get rid of them

565
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:33,600
You'll feel better if you have

566
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:37,184
So anyway

567
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,488
I think you'd be easy.

568
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:45,888
Lame duck president that's a new thing

569
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:49,728
We would be able to use it if Hillary Clinton was in office

570
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,920
Problem that Alex's

571
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:59,456
Describing the globalist Abba

572
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:01,504
Migraines all of the pillars of

573
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,808
The problem he's describing are not true

574
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:05,856
Is a solution

575
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:08,416
Because

576
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:10,720
Yeah

577
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:11,488
But here's

578
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:12,256
The solution

579
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:15,840
Griffin comes out

580
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:19,680
Kind of failed comedian

581
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:24,032
Feels like a store mannequin

582
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:27,616
And she comes out

583
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:31,712
Videographer

584
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:35,040
Image of the president with his head cut off

585
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:36,576
With blood pouring out

586
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:37,856
Across his face

587
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:39,392
Most you've already seen the image

588
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:45,024
The top story in the world since it came out yesterday because it's so iconic The Girl Next Door

589
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:47,584
Looks like an elementary school teacher

590
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,704
Had on President Trump

591
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:08,320
I go to sleep liquor

592
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,368
Elizabeth

593
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:12,672
Kathy Griffin picture

594
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:17,536
And that's going to be the solution for all of these the Russian narrative is falling apart

595
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:19,328
Trump is going up in the polls

596
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,352
What do you do

597
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:22,400
If you get a failed comedian

598
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:23,936
Career

599
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:24,704
She has had a

600
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,544
It's Against All Odds amazing career

601
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,336
My career for hers very quickly

602
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:32,896
Very much so

603
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:36,480
What is a quorum

604
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,784
Trumped

605
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,552
Trumps

606
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:41,344
Severed head

607
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:45,696
That's alright and then I would have a lot of people

608
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:48,256
Jerk off onto a skull and encrusted

609
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:50,816
Absolutely exact

610
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:54,912
And

611
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:58,496
He's going to develop his narrative throughout the course of the episode

612
00:28:58,752 --> 00:28:59,264
Explain what

613
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,032
You mean

614
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:01,824
By Kathy Griffin beat the answer

615
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:03,616
Global

616
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:04,384
Problems

617
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,408
Yes

618
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:07,968
I can't

619
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:08,992
Kathy Griffin

620
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,320
Is the answer to the globalist problem

621
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:13,856
Globalist

622
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:14,880
Really bad at this

623
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:15,904
Barrett

624
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,696
It's probably cuz I don't

625
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:19,232
What

626
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:20,768
He's going to explain

627
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:24,608
Like his what he thinks is going on his analysis and all this

628
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,400
But along the way

629
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:28,192
He is doing

630
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:28,960
So much

631
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:29,728
Projection

632
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:30,752
Like

633
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:35,104
Whenever he talks about the mainstream media you kind of get the sense he's talking about him

634
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:36,896
Cuz last week

635
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:38,944
He was talking about how he was losing tons

636
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:43,808
Now marked all his product down

637
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:46,368
Even further than their Memorial Day sale

638
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:51,744
Extended the Memorial Day sales and chopped off like 10% from other things

639
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,024
And

640
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:56,096
You now saying I don't know if it's always been the case but never said it

641
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:58,400
If you get on auto-ship

642
00:29:58,912 --> 00:29:59,936
Right you get your

643
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:00,960
His pills

644
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,776
Whatever price you get it at

645
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:05,056
You lock in that price

646
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:07,104
Know if you get like

647
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,384

649
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:11,968
Did you get it on auto-ship

650
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:12,736
You can sit

651
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:14,784
2% off price

652
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:16,576
As long as you get it

653
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:18,880
That he's taking a bath on the supplement

654
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:20,160
At this point

655
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:21,440
Is broke yeah

656
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:24,768
Holy crap

657
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:28,096
Was not that good

658
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:31,680
Also plays into what's going to end

659
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:33,216
Which is

660
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:33,984
Delightful

661
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,616
I love me some hobo Johnson

662
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:41,408
Talking about how much celebrities

663
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:50,368
As part of the establishment

664
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,464
Because they understand that all these attacks all these calls for violence on Trump

665
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:59,840
Backfiring on them in a big big way

666
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:01,376
High Praise for the

667
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:08,544
I have a video clip that I'm going to play here

668
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:16,992
Snoop Dogg

669
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:18,272
All two of them

670
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:22,112
It's all of the ones that he always goes

671
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:23,136
It's just

672
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:24,416
Video of Madonna saying

673
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:25,952
She thought about blowing up the White House

674
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:28,000
Write convenient that at the end

675
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:29,024
She says

676
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:33,120
But I don't but I wouldn't never do that

677
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:34,400
Just eclipse

00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:35,680
Snoop Dogg with a gun

679
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:37,472
Atrophic Trump

680
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:43,872
If I don't I don't know if they even kept in the part where I put the bang flag out comic move

681
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:45,408
Now here's what I would do

682
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,688
If I were putting together the

683
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:47,456
This video

684
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:48,736
Video

685
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:50,528
I would underlay YG

686
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:51,552
Geez f*** Donald

687
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:55,392
Perfect family show

688
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:57,696

689
00:31:57,952 --> 00:32:02,816
Projector

690
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:06,400
This is really is talk about himself

691
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:12,544
Initiative

692
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:16,128
Terroristic

693
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:22,528
Chaga

694
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:24,064
Rock bottom

695
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,560
Assault on Trump

696
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:41,216
Classics

697
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:47,360
Trying to reorganize and decide what new lies they need to push and put out

698
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:49,664
Wow that's that is

699
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:53,248
Eerily similar

700
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:55,808
He's doing really feels like

701
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,368
Cuz I mean what is he doing

702
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,464
Taking a respite taking a big Brethren talk about anything that matters

703
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,232
Firefighter

704
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:05,536
Dogpile on Kathy Griffin

705
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:07,584
Then no one cares

706
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:09,120
I love I love that

707
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:10,656
Bullying

00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:11,424
So much

709
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,448
Yeah

710
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:14,496
Eristic bullying

711
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:15,520
Awful

712
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:17,568
People bully

713
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:18,336
Yeah

714
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:19,360
I hate it when people bully

715
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:21,920
You should believe those bullies

716
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:25,248
VH1

717
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,552
Is the show where people that get their bullies

718
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:30,880
Amanda MMA fighter with lights

719
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,976
You think you're tough

720
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:36,000
Beat up this kid

721
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:37,024
What about me

722
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,816
I'm in the Bollywood train

723
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:43,424
Okay

00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:47,776

Totally I'm sorry

731
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:07,488
I can't think of anything other than that now like I can't

732
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:09,024
Think of anything but the meeting

733
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,048
Where somebody was like

734
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,072
This

735
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:14,912
Is the best show we've ever thought up we wanted to be on

736
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:17,472
MTV and VH1 really lost it

737
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:18,496
For a couple years

738
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:24,128
My mom

739
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:27,200
Alright I'm onboard parental control that was a show

740
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:27,968
Parents got to

741
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:34,112
Amistad

742
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:38,976
Will you go on a date with a girl's mom and then if she liked you got to date the daughter

743
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:48,960
That's throwing anything out there

744
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:56,128
Everything else

745
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:03,296
Comic

746
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:04,064
Courvoisier

747
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:06,880
Decide

748
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:09,952
About

749
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:21,984
Financing stop killing Riot civil unrest

750
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:33,248
Resume

751
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:45,792
Personality

752
00:35:57,824 --> 00:36:00,128
Expose the MSM

753
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:03,968

754
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:05,504
Give us

755
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,272
All of your money

756
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:14,208
Of course you have to pay to be in the contest I know you love the animation contests and so what I heard

757
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:15,744
Contest

758
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,280
I was like

759
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:20,096
Specific in a little bit

760
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,912
It's the biggest shark

761
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:24,448
In the world

762
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:25,472
But

763
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:27,776
I have this Vision now of

764
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:29,056
The globalist

765
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:33,664
Is sitting around this giant like dr. Strangelove table

766
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,688
Just walking in there being

767
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:37,760
When should we have

768
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:39,040
The riot there's debate

769
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:41,856
Play Summer

770
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:49,280
Not too hot that's what I imagine it's like whenever the globalist

771
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:54,912
Stupid

772
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:56,960
To see the leaves change color

773
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:02,080
R-Truth that should organize

774
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:03,104
Yeah right

775
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:07,456
Understand

776
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:10,016
What do you think is going to lead the March

777
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:13,088
What you doing is 100% like in that cliff

778
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:14,880
Literally doing everything

779
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:16,928
A fascist propagandist would do

780
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:19,232
He's trying to invalidate the Press

781
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:20,768
He's trying to attack

782
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:21,536
Depressed

783
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:22,816
At the same time

784
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:24,096
He's a labeling

785
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:26,656
Legitimate protest as riots

786
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:28,448
That's

787
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:32,288
If you were an authoritarian leader there's a little more that you would want out of a mouth

788
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:35,872
It's almost like bullying

789
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,920
I can think of a few like

790
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:39,200
Lycra

791
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:40,736
Some examples of that exact

792
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,296
From

793
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:44,320
Turkey

794
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:47,648
Sure

795
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:49,696
I don't know

796
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:53,024
Soon-to-be

797
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,048
Soon-to-be us

798
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:57,888
Is pretty short but I think it's

799
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:00,448
Really telling

800
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,984
About what else

801
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,008
Think matters

802
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:05,824
And it's super f***** up

803
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,872
I don't I don't know how to set it up

804
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:08,640
Just listen to it

805
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:12,992
Chicago Tribune

806
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:17,088
Properties on the soft targets again value of them today

807
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:21,696
These people are at war with us

808
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:26,560
Why the f*** do I care what trumps

809
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:27,840
Houses are valued at

810
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:29,120
I don't give a s***

811
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:31,936
Read the article that he's talking about

812
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:32,704
I did mention

813
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,240
MSNBC

814
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:36,800
Counterterrorism expert

815
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:38,848
That Isis shoot bomb Trump filled

816
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:39,872
That was Malcolm

817
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:43,200
From there I watched everything that you put out

818
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:45,504
Watch the clipping

819
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:47,296
That

820
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:49,600
Obviously would want

821
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:50,624
To Target is building

822
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:52,160
He saying that the

823
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:53,184
If you had to predict

824
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,720
Those would be the first Target

825
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:56,000
Course they were

826
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:59,072
Idiot not to think that really

827
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:07,520
It doesn't seem like it would be hard for Isis to really get one in the in the Trump Tower

828
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:10,848
Because there's a lot of protection there and what have you but go to one of the other one

829
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:13,408
The perfect snakes blow up a golf

830
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:16,736
Two bag

831
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:26,208
Bob and I told you

832
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:27,488
Falling into a giant pit

833
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:29,024
Isis

834
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:31,584
Donate to the shelter

835
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:39,520
Aw that one back whenever what matters it

836
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:40,288
Steve's doors

837
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,848
Now you're not

838
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:43,872
Is Trump

839
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:44,896
Property

840
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:47,712
That is important to him and he thinks the people who

841
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:49,504
Would act against that

842
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:51,552
Are at war with

843
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:54,624
I know I don't understand

844
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:56,416
That's it.

845
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:59,488
Like that's really where he goes

846
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:06,400
The property value of

847
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:08,960
His houses of his property

848
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:10,496
Obviously

849
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:11,776
Their value

850
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:16,896
I think that

851
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:17,920
Alex

852
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:19,968
Alex's house is not worth as much as

853
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:22,272
Responsible

854
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:24,576
Possible there's no about it

855
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:25,856
Bella's house

856
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:28,928
We Are Young

857
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:30,720
Crazy high right now

858
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:32,768
Court on Tuesday

859
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:33,792
Yeah that's it

860
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:36,096
Anyway

861
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:41,728
Awesome

862
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:43,264
And then Alex

863
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:46,336
Consulta Mickey Rourke

864
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:47,360
And then

865
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:48,384
Alex Jones

866
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:49,920
Not understand Pro-Line

867
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:51,456
It's really at it

868
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:52,736
Really fascinating

869
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,272
What he thinks he's doing

870
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:57,088
Just let this play and then you can ask your

871
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:18,592
Look at this poor guy he looks like a Catwoman had some plastic surgery

872
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:21,664
It's big right after bombed out of the brain totally insane

873
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,456
Hollywood

874
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:30,112
Mickey Rourke

875
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:50,336
Like a clown

876
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:52,640
You look like

877
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:55,967
Really overweight rain

878
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:11,839
How do you know you guys look like

879
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:15,935
Club Paradise

880
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:19,519
With so like I know

881
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:20,799
I know

882
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:23,615
It's so bizarre

883
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:25,663
It's so bizarre

884
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:27,711
It's just like

885
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:29,759
I'm trolling the media

886
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:32,319
But what part of it is trolling

887
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:35,135
What is it that you're saying that word

888
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:37,951
Is that the part that strolling

889
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:38,975
Is it

890
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:42,303
Understand understand

891
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:47,679
There's a reason that word is a

892
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:48,959
Them

893
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:51,263
He means I think

894
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:52,287
I think he

895
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:53,567
Thinks that

896
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:55,615
When the MSM reports on

897
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:56,383
Unless they're going to take

898
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:57,407
Take that out of

899
00:42:58,431 --> 00:42:59,199
And be like

900
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:00,735
Here's Alex Jones

901
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:05,599
Transgender

902
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:06,367
Buddy is

903
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:07,391
Exactly

904
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:11,487
He doesn't understand that by the very name

905
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:12,511
Nature of him

906
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:14,303
Throwing off those things

907
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:19,935
Using the investigation

908
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:23,263
Yeah I don't think you understand when people

909
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:26,335
Ask not to be called the n-word or the t-word

910
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:28,895
They're not doing it because they want you to be nice to them

911
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:31,199
They're doing it because those words have been used

912
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:32,223
People

913
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:32,991
Throughout

914
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:34,271
Time

915
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:35,295
Right

916
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:37,855
Insults

917
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:41,439
Towards people

918
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:43,487
It's not like it is

919
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:49,375
If something was used as a pejorative

920
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:51,679
Stop bullying me

921
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:54,239
Bracebridge Second Amendment

922
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:56,287
Second Amendment

923
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:58,591
So

924
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:00,639
A free speech right

925
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:01,919
More importantly

926
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:04,479
Hell yeah McKee Road

927
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:10,367
Can suck my f****** dick you are goddamn right

928
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:13,695
Are you going to do

929
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:19,071
So it is next clip

930
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:20,607
Because does not see

931
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:23,167
Exactly the same

932
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:24,191
Jones love

933
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:24,959
So much

934
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:31,359
Like

935
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:32,639
Exactly that

936
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:34,175
Yeah

937
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:37,759
Suddenly being like

938
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:39,295
Let me tell you something

939
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:40,575
Because you're in

940
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:41,599
That's why I like

941
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:42,879
F*** you you should be

942
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:45,439
If you're out Jones just be like you know what

943
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:46,975
I disagree with you

944
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:55,679
What are you talking about

945
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:57,215
The wording

946
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:58,751
Every part of that

947
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:05,407
Exactly what Alex Jones I think you Adam Schiff I think that Alex Jones was drunker and less

948
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:08,223
Creative than exhausted

949
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:14,623
I don't know I have no idea

950
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:16,415
Big ants

951
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:19,231
How could he not how could he not at least respect

952
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:22,303
Has a vested interest in not

953
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:23,583
You know yes

954
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:24,351
Right but they

955
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:28,703
We can Punk move I know but

956
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:29,983
Jones is a b****

957
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:31,007
We're coming

958
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:33,055
I don't like using

959
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:36,895
We're coming to the

960
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,431
From a rational perspective

961
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:39,455
That's a problem

962
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:41,247
Cuz he lives in a rational world

963
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:45,087
But he has to hold up

964
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:47,647
You going to hold up that line

965
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:48,671
Are we going

966
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:51,231
There's a lot of things that we could give up on

967
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:52,767
I we don't have to defend

968
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:59,167
Like we're liberal-minded people but we don't give a f*** about Kathy Griffin

969
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,191
Flexible about thing

970
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:02,751
Cuz we're not hearing

971
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:05,055
And you can

972
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:06,847
That I

973
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:09,663
Is the people on the right

974
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:13,503
Arby's

975
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:14,783
That whole thing

976
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:18,623
Then you have people who are like

977
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:19,647
What are you f******

978
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:21,439
King talking about they net

979
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:23,487
Big dude

980
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:25,791
A burden pictures of people

981
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:30,399
Burning Obama has done

982
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:32,191
Either way

983
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:33,727
You're just sitting there

984
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:35,519
One of those

985
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:36,543
Is

986
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:38,079
Intentional

987
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:39,615
Yeah

988
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:41,663
The Griffin does not actually want to

989
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:44,735
A lot of

990
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:51,903
It was not a symbolic was making an artistic statement but at the same time it was aggressive and vile

991
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:52,927
And like

992
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:55,231
I'm not going to let her off the hook

993
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:57,279
If you're just trying to save it like

994
00:46:58,047 --> 00:46:59,071
One person

995
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:00,095
Hanging

996
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:01,887
Obama

997
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:04,703
Is equivalent or is is worse

998
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:07,007
Because it's racially-charged

999
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:07,775
2

1000
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:10,591
Intention

1001
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:13,151
Maybe

1002
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:15,967
I don't know if that's fair though I don't I don't

1003
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:18,015
Think it's fair to say that those people who

1004
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:20,063
Expressed themselves

1005
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:24,159
Through lynching a fake Obama I don't know what they want

1006
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:29,535
I did express yourself through lynching a fake Obama

1007
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:34,655
He said he's well with whatever whatever you're following argument is going to be

1008
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:36,959
I'm just going to go right back to the express

1009
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:38,239
Themselves

1010
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:46,175
I'm not thrilled with that came out of my now the argument of making is I don't think that they would necessarily hang

1011
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:49,759
In the same way that I obviously

1012
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:50,783
Kathy Griffin wouldn't

1013
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:51,807
Behead Donald Trump

1014
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:54,367
Like I think that there is

1015
00:47:55,647 --> 00:48:00,255
Would you just for a joke

1016
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:03,583
Never going to get everybody's wrong

1017
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:07,935
I don't either

1018
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:09,727
But I wish Alex hadn't brought it up

1019
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:12,287
So I could continue to live in my world where I don't

1020
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:14,335
Just ignore it

1021
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:15,871
But you know you can't ignore

1022
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:17,151
Alex Jones

1023
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:17,919
Has a nuke on

1024
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:19,967
Now we're going to get to it

1025
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:27,903
It is also

1026
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:37,375
Infowars.com Mike cernovich

1027
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:39,935

1029
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:48,127

What is Kathy

1031
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:51,711

1032
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:54,015
He said you know how you did your Bill Clinton's a rapist

1033
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:56,063

And out

1035
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:04,255
You have a rally

1036
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:08,095
They tried to change the subject

1037
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:15,775
Bill Clinton at chateau

1038
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:19,103
And Wild

1039
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:32,927
All the child

1040
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:38,815
Also when I'm nuts

1041
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:43,679
Others work to get

1042
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:46,751

1043
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:51,103
And I work will you the listeners

1044
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:52,895
I promise we're about

1045
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:53,919
To get to the actual account

1046
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:55,455
This is just

1047
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:56,479
Himself off by what

1048
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:00,319
He's talking about how he

1049
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:01,599
He's got the most successful

1050
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:08,255
No action disorder

1051
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:11,327
And I agree

1052
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:12,863
So I

1053
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:13,887
We're about to get to the x

1054
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:16,959
And to make it more fun everybody that

1055
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:19,519
Get the shirt for more than 5 seconds or so

1056
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:27,967
You get $1,000 if you do it

1057
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:33,343
Are a bunch of terroristic bullies

1058
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:36,671
I don't care

1059
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:45,375
Do the ball drops

1060
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:49,727
All the company

1061
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:52,031
And defendants were going to sell it t-shirt

1062
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:54,335

1063
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:56,383
If you're wearing the T-shirt

1064

00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:08,927
2500 until it hits $200,000

1066
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:27,871
Mossad is

1067
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:30,431
It's not a conic it's already

1068
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:31,199
Snooze

1069
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:35,295
Different story

1070
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:36,063
The morning of

1071
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:37,343
This broadcast

1072
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:38,879
G2000

1073
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:44,255
Have more gigs with Sienna and she really was just there ball drop with Ryan Seacrest lady

1074
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:53,215
Maybe fell through a little how to say probably a few of them are actually in the South I assume you got to take a little break maybe go to

1075
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:56,799
Vegas for a bit

1076
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:00,895
Workout

1077
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:01,919
Yeah

1078
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:03,199
Like the thing is

1079
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:07,551
Alex think like we're good we talked about

1080
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:08,831
Nothing but Kathy Griffin

1081
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:11,647
6 months

1082
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:14,463
I mean the rest of his phone

1083
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:17,279
He's making everybody knows that

1084
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:19,327
It's based on like Shepard Fairey

1085
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:20,607
Style

1086
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:23,423
With her holding a severed Trump head

1087
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:24,959
And it says terrorists

1088
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:25,727
3 mm

1089
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:27,263
CNN terrorist

1090
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:29,311
Onnit

1091
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:31,359
Backfires

1092
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:35,967
So fast she's already fired and the shirts are a week away

1093
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:39,039
Emoji bats

1094
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:41,087
Why do you want to put that image out

1095
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:42,879
I don't know

1096
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:43,903
That's

1097
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:47,743
Yeah we want to remind everybody about how

1098
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:50,047
Pretty much everybody feels most

1099
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:52,607
Because they think

1100
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:56,447
This is the jump the shark moment

1101
00:52:56,703 --> 00:52:57,215
For Trump

1102
00:52:57,727 --> 00:52:58,239
When it's not

1103
00:52:58,495 --> 00:52:59,263
It's not at all

1104
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:01,055
Something off

1105
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:04,127
On some weird Side Road that most people aren't going to

1106
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:06,943
It's somewhere over there we're all ignoring it

1107
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:12,831
Moving forward to the actual investigations the facts of my life

1108
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:14,623
She is going to take a

1109
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:16,671
F****** hudalla on this

1110
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:21,023
I don't I don't remember all the clips that I have put

1111
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:27,679
He says that he ordered 10 varieties is they all have to do with the Kathy Griffin picture

1112
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:29,471
Call man

1113
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:31,519
Broadcast pretty-much

1114
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:32,543
60% of the time

1115
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:36,127
That picture was on the big screen behind him at the news desk

1116
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:37,407
It's like

1117
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:38,431
Take a bath on

1118
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:42,015
He thinks this is going to save him as the new meme

1119
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:44,831
But it's not it's not going to work

1120
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:46,367
It's terrible

1121
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:47,647
He's not going to do well

1122
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:50,975
But the flip side of it is he has enough rabid fans

1123
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:52,511
Want those shirts

1124
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:55,583
I don't think he'll even sell that many of those

1125
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:57,119
I think

1126
00:53:57,887 --> 00:53:58,399
It'll be okay

1127
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:01,727
I don't think you'll hit $200,000 give him out

1128
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:04,799
Bye

1129
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:05,823
Yeah

1130
00:54:06,335 --> 00:54:07,615
The bigger issue

1131
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:09,407
Is that this is

1132
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:10,431
Trying to get

1133
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:13,247
Pictures of bats

1134
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:14,783
Right

1135
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:16,831
Opportunity

1136
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:19,391
Monopoly McDonald's

1137
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:20,671
That's what it is

1138
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:21,439
Yep

1139
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:24,255
Levi t-shirts so you might win

1140
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:27,071
How many people have access to getting on

1141
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:30,655
The news necessarily of the people who are going to buy these shirts

1142
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:35,263
You get on the local news and asked to go viral for it to pay off

1143
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:36,031
And

1144
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:37,311
In order for it to pay off

1145
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:39,871
You have to say infowars.com

1146
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:41,151
While you're on the thing

1147
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:43,455
Oh really there even more catches

1148
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:45,759
Yeah

1149
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:49,087
You seen on TV

1150
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:51,135
With one of those shirts or assign

1151
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:51,903
It says that

1152
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:55,231
You get $2,500

1153
00:54:55,743 --> 00:54:57,535
If you have one of those on TV

1154
00:54:57,791 --> 00:54:59,839
And you say infowars.com

1155
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:00,863
Repeat

1156
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:07,519
Bumfights

1157
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:08,287
Open chat

1158
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:09,567
So

1159
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:14,175
It's all it's all clear in this neck

1160
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:15,711
But

1161
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:18,015
And I got to buy

1162
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:22,367
The shirts are being produced

1163
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:32,095
Contest

1164
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:34,399
Operation

1165
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:36,447
Real Alex Jones

1166
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:44,895
You can make your own any of the login password

1167
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:46,175
Make your own t-shirt

1168
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:50,527
What you doing

1169
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:57,183
However you do it just get it on the news that CNN is a terrorist organization

1170
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:00,511
There's two pieces to that the first

1171
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:03,839
The shirts will be here in a week but don't worry

1172
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:04,863
Buy them now

1173
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:09,983
And then he said make your own shirt

1174
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:11,263
Do your own s***

1175
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:15,359
Because he knows that even if people do their own stuff it's still advertise

1176
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:17,919
It's still absolute free advertise

1177
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:19,711
So

1178
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:23,295
Like that is trolling

1179
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:30,719
That's what that is trying to get on CNN's putting that but I also know

1180
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:31,743
Anybody who's watching

1181
00:56:33,279 --> 00:56:35,327
To be like I forgot we'll check out

1182
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:37,119
It's it's trolling

1183
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:39,423
To the news to stomachs

1184
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:41,983
Put on a greater excited strolling his audio

1185
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:43,263
Right

1186
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:45,567
If you buy these shirts

1187
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:48,127
Play into this you're the rude

1188
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:49,663
You're the one who's beautimarq

1189
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:53,503
If you listen to Infowars you're already

1190
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:55,039
You're already past that point

1191
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:56,319
You might as well go Whole Hog

1192
00:56:56,831 --> 00:57:01,183
So in this next clip Alex admits that what Kathy Griffin did was totally legal

1193
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:02,719
It was of course it was

1194
00:57:02,975 --> 00:57:07,839
But then he gets to be failed predict

1195
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:11,679
Kathy Griffin should be ashamed

1196
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:17,055
Noxious

1197
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:26,527
Putting the idea of violence and this whole atmosphere of the riots

1198
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:41,631
Ukraine

1199
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:44,703
The pub

1200
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:46,495
It's just people are so

1201
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:55,455
I said they hiring

1202
00:57:55,711 --> 00:57:58,527
What is our next tactic going to be false flag

1203
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:01,599
If you guys

1204
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:04,415
Oh yeah they would make themselves a f****** victim

1205
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:09,535
Some kind of right-wing terrorist you f****** murdering people yeah they would make the

1206
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:13,631
There's already enough right

1207
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:15,423
Murder ink

1208
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:16,959
The most dangerous

1209
00:58:17,215 --> 00:58:17,727
F****** people

1210
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:19,263
In this country right now

1211
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:20,543
Are old white

1212
00:58:21,823 --> 00:58:22,591
F****** X2

1213
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:27,199
Well that situation to you if you think that

1214
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:31,551
You guys are doing more than

1215
00:58:31,807 --> 00:58:32,319
F****** enough

1216
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:38,463
Well the further thing that I agree with you but also if you're listening to our investigation back into

1217
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:39,487
The 2015

1218
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:41,535
You'll recognize some of this language

1219
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:43,839
Because Alex Jones

1220
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:45,887
In 2015 about how it was going to

1221
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:47,423
To be the summer of Rage

1222
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:49,215
Yeah that never came to be

1223
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:50,495
He always does

1224
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:52,031
He always predict

1225
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:53,823
Basically almost every summer

1226
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:54,847
That's it's going to

1227
00:58:55,103 --> 00:58:56,639
Jump office hours

1228
00:58:56,895 --> 00:58:57,919
The summer of 69

1229
00:58:58,175 --> 00:58:59,455
And he's always known some

1230
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:00,735
First real six string

1231
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:03,807
Guitar

1232
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:05,087
But you know what

1233
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:06,623
What your knife for good news

1234
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:07,391
What's a good

1235
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:08,927
Alex Jones a smart man

1236
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:11,999
He's figured everything out

1237
00:59:12,255 --> 00:59:15,327
He's figured out exactly what the globalist threw up to

1238
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:17,119
And he's going to lay out his plan

1239
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:19,679
I'm pretty sure he's figured out what the globalist

1240
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:20,447
Have been up

1241
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:26,847
Two for 20 years and none of it has come true. All of this but it doesn't

1242
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:30,175
Okay you're waving it away

1243
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:32,223
Fair enough

1244
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:34,527
Vic news in the past let it die let it

1245
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:35,807
Be buried the past

1246
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:38,111
Alright you can't live in pasty white 2K

1247
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:41,951
Come on man

1248
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:43,743
Okay

1249
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:46,303
You come up with things like this also I believe that this

1250
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:48,351
Is pretty strong evidence that Alex Jones

1251
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:50,911
Episode

1252
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:52,959
This is such an exciting

1253
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:55,775
Because I've been waiting for other contact

1254
00:59:56,287 --> 01:00:02,431
I've been saying any contest for free speech legal in Laughlin

1255
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:05,247
Bill Clinton Joker

1256
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:07,295
Obama Joker stuff we've done

1257
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:10,879
But I've been waiting for the right moment

1258
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:19,327
Can be destroyed by that they've gone too far people are fed up she did this right at the right moment

1259
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:23,679
About to reject

1260
01:00:24,447 --> 01:00:25,983
The numbers show that

1261
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:29,823
Where they've now or throwing her overboard

1262
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:38,783
Preparing riots the summer they want to reply

1263
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:42,623
Start the crying

1264
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:45,951
A month out from before they trigger

1265
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:50,815
We're almost exactly a month out from the July 3rd riots

1266
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:57,215
Stop.

1267
01:00:57,471 --> 01:00:59,775
False flags on Patriot

1268
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:01,823
Yeah what you think about that

1269
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:03,359
He figured it out

1270
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:04,127
I mean

1271
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:05,663
Justin

1272
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:07,967
Let's just

1273
01:01:08,479 --> 01:01:12,319
No I'm not I'm saying

1274
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:15,391
The mainstream media

1275
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:16,671
For Alex Jones

1276
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:18,975
Has developed a very poor plan

1277
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:21,279
Alex Jones

1278
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:23,583
And that's what he think

1279
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:24,863
I'll give you the reality

1280
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:29,215
There's a bunch of people who were very pissed off about the way the Trump is

1281
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:30,495
Comporting himself

1282
01:01:30,751 --> 01:01:31,775
I'm so they planned marches

1283
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:34,335
To peacefully organize a protest

1284
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:36,127
Isaias the right of

1285
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:38,175
Citizens

1286
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:39,455
Secondarily

1287
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:42,783
Is a nut job

1288
01:01:44,063 --> 01:01:45,343
Picture that was

1289
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:49,183
On the right or the left

1290
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:52,767
Class

1291
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:54,047
I'm not into that

1292
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:57,119
No thank you no thank you

1293
01:01:58,655 --> 01:01:59,935
The collective response

1294
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:00,703
What's the Kathy Griffin

1295
01:02:01,983 --> 01:02:06,335
Nothing

1296
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:10,687
Promptly certainly more promptly then Fox News has ever fired anybody

1297
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:12,735
Fake news

1298
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:17,343
So it's all resolved already

1299
01:02:18,623 --> 01:02:19,391
A result

1300
01:02:20,415 --> 01:02:21,183
There's nothing left

1301
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:22,975
But Alex thinks

1302
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:24,255
It's going to be the big

1303
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:27,327
Let's have our own

1304
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:28,607
Okay

1305
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:31,679
If you find somebody wearing one of those shirt

1306
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:33,727
And you email us a pic

1307
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:35,263
Give me hog

1308
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:39,871
We will give you an honorary policy

1309
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:42,943
If you see one of those f****** shirts in the wild

1310
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:46,783
I've only ever seen one Infowars shirt in Pueblo

1311
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:48,063
Yeah ever

1312
01:02:48,575 --> 01:02:50,111
Marty

1313
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:53,695
Do a show in the middle of Indy party dress

1314
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:57,023
Yeah I had a show in the middle of Indiana

1315
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:02,911
Umaga

1316
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:06,239
I like we are in the middle of Indiana

1317
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:07,775
Bruiser still one guy

1318
01:03:08,031 --> 01:03:08,543
Right

1319
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:09,823
Akbar one dude

1320
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:10,591
I want to see

1321
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:16,991
It was like a unicorn I want to know I want to know how many of those shirts

1322
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:19,039
I want an exact

1323
01:03:19,551 --> 01:03:20,319
I can't imagine

1324
01:03:20,575 --> 01:03:23,391
It's not many I mean the only cost five bucks

1325
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:25,695
He sells a hundred of those at

1326
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:27,231
It's free shipping in the month

1327
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:31,583
Please try to give a s*** away

1328
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:34,143
He's having trouble

1329
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:37,215
Sincerely believe that all of this is just indication

1330
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:38,495
The chit is falling

1331
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:39,263
Park

1332
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:42,591
Of course that also would explain his manic episode

1333
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:46,175
Also I don't think he was in court on Tuesday I think it was probably having

1334
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:46,943
In a bender

1335
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:47,967
But

1336
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:50,527
Jerome corsi news didn't

1337
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:52,575
No password

1338
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:53,855
I was jumped at.

1339
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:55,903
Anyway

1340
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:58,463
At this point in the episode Mike cernovich

1341
01:03:58,719 --> 01:03:59,231
It's in the mix

1342
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:04,095
He says some of the dumbest

1343
01:04:06,399 --> 01:04:06,911
He is

1344
01:04:09,215 --> 01:04:09,983
About this

1345
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:10,751
This contest

1346
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:12,543
He's super into it

1347
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:15,103
Because it was his idea

1348
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:22,527
Which is a which is a fantastic little trick of like

1349
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:26,623
I have this idea but it's really your idea so you know it's a

1350
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:27,391
Good idea

1351
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:30,463
Is the Golden Boy

1352
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:32,511
It doesn't work

1353
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:33,535
It's going to be home

1354
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:36,607
What I think is

1355
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:39,167
The funniest is that this is how cernovich starts

1356
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:40,959
Eight tries to

1357
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:45,823
Maybe be a little bit grandiose about the purpose of this contest

1358
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:46,847
And it's pretty funny

1359
01:04:56,831 --> 01:05:02,975
Ways to help

1360
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:27,551
But also

1361
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:35,231
If you want to get into the media game

1362
01:05:35,487 --> 01:05:41,631
I remember I remember Ted Koppel

1363
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:43,423
Such a n

1364
01:05:44,447 --> 01:05:44,959
And was

1365
01:05:45,215 --> 01:05:46,751
Edward armero had a con

1366
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:50,335
You remember that

1367
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:51,359
These face on it

1368
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:52,639
Mediterra

1369
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:53,407
Despair

1370
01:05:54,687 --> 01:05:59,551
I apologize

1371
01:06:00,063 --> 01:06:04,159
I got that mixed up with

1372
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:05,439
Prince sir

1373
01:06:07,487 --> 01:06:07,999
That is

1374
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:11,583
The craziest thing I've ever heard the contest

1375
01:06:12,095 --> 01:06:14,911
To help Young Guns who want to get into the media game

1376
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:16,447
Yeah you're

1377
01:06:16,703 --> 01:06:19,775
You know that most things don't work like Rebel media

1378
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:26,175
You know most things don't work like Lauren Southern

1379
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:32,575
40 G

1380
01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:33,343
Tired

1381
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:38,463
It wasn't great but you got moxie

1382
01:06:38,975 --> 01:06:42,559
You're very cute women Uranus

1383
01:06:42,815 --> 01:06:44,095
It's like they think it's

1384
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:46,143
Team Ford

1385
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:48,191
New York whatever like

1386
01:06:48,447 --> 01:06:49,471
And

1387
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:53,055
A doctor Roebuck Billy Bathgate where everybody

1388
01:06:53,311 --> 01:06:56,127
Little kids wandering down the cobblestone streets like

1389
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:57,151
Hey Richard

1390
01:06:57,407 --> 01:07:00,479
You work for the

1391
01:07:00,735 --> 01:07:02,783
You're a maid a boy

1392
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:05,855
It's also it also has the smell of like

1393
01:07:07,135 --> 01:07:09,951
It would be the equivalent of getting a job

1394
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:13,279
Howard Stern radio

1395
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:16,095
By going on someone else's show and yelling Baba Booey

1396
01:07:16,351 --> 01:07:17,887
You know

1397
01:07:18,143 --> 01:07:22,495
All you're doing is disrupting people and giving Alex Free Press

1398
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:25,567
You are not doing anything for your own brand

1399
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:28,895
You're not helping yourself at all but because they know that people are

1400
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:32,991
Stupid listen to their stuff

1401
01:07:33,247 --> 01:07:33,759
Your foot in the door

1402
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:35,039
Is there a real

1403
01:07:35,295 --> 01:07:36,831
I think if you're charismatic enough

1404
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:40,671
When you're on Are You The UPS Store

1405
01:07:43,743 --> 01:07:44,511
You're right you are part

1406
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:50,911
Like like that f****** nuts

1407
01:07:51,423 --> 01:07:51,935
That's really good stuff

1408
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:52,703
Yeah

1409
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:53,983
I mean it's just not

1410
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:55,007
But it's even worse

1411
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:56,287
The next group is even worse

1412
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:57,311
Listen to this

1413
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:10,367
Cars

1414
01:08:10,623 --> 01:08:13,695
Build a civilization

1415
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:28,031
People

1416
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:34,687
There's

1417
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:41,087
This is how you do it there's so delusional delusional basic doing a contest where you can win at the

1418
01:08:41,343 --> 01:08:43,135
Thousand dollars to troll

1419
01:08:43,391 --> 01:08:47,231
That's creating prosperity

1420
01:08:47,487 --> 01:08:49,023
Is it is a stimulus package

1421
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:51,327
Yeah

1422
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:53,375
As much as

1423
01:08:55,167 --> 01:08:56,191
Sure

1424
01:08:56,447 --> 01:08:59,519
I think of randomly maybe putting out

1425
01:08:59,775 --> 01:09:01,567
Roughly 50 Grand at

1426
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:04,895
Most is really going to jump start

1427
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:08,223
Think of all the things

1428
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:09,503
You could buy with $1,000

1429
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:10,527
Not that much

1430
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:12,319
You could buy a

1431
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:13,855
Medium-level TV

1432
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:15,391
Maybe yes sir

1433
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:17,183
Least

1434
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:18,207
At least

1435
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:21,023
10000 Big Mac

1436
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:23,327
1 2/3 months rent

1437
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:30,495
Amarillo

1438
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:33,311
Salat if you're a child

1439
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:37,663
Like a fifteen-year-old if your fifteen-year-old do you want to go out there and put on one of those shirts

1440
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:41,503
Which I think is irresponsible to go out there and put on one of those

1441
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:42,783
You need to have a

1442
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:43,551
Conversation

1443
01:09:44,063 --> 01:09:47,903
Alex Jones better give someone $5,000 to put it on a onesie

1444
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:49,695
That would be amazing

1445
01:09:50,463 --> 01:09:53,279
F****** lunatic is it to be like

1446
01:09:53,791 --> 01:09:56,607
This is creating prosperity

1447
01:09:57,631 --> 01:10:00,447
To me this doesn't sound like their usual lying like

1448
01:10:00,703 --> 01:10:02,239
I think they're cool on deluge

1449
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:06,079
This day or really believing

1450
01:10:07,103 --> 01:10:11,967
This b**** your episodes

1451
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:16,063
I got this great idea

1452
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:20,927
This was going to bring us out of that f****** hole that we've been in

1453
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:24,255
I haven't slept for 3

1454
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:30,911
You just listen to one bucket

1455
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:33,471
Maybe we wouldn't be in this situation huh

1456
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:36,799
Maybe it's we're losing a lot of it.

1457
01:10:37,311 --> 01:10:43,455
It t-shirts already

1458
01:10:43,711 --> 01:10:48,831
Who killed even bigger story

1459
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:52,415
Would be an even bigger story than corsi's bombshell information

1460
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:53,183
Dead course

1461
01:10:53,695 --> 01:10:55,999
If there was a corpse e

1462
01:10:59,071 --> 01:11:01,631
Delusions of grandeur

1463
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:02,655
But like

1464
01:11:03,423 --> 01:11:07,263
I think that Alex is having a manic episode and I think crnkovich my

1465
01:11:07,775 --> 01:11:09,311
I don't know

1466
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:15,711
Easter bread

1467
01:11:16,991 --> 01:11:17,759
3/3 mm inches

1468
01:11:18,015 --> 01:11:18,527
Daughter

1469
01:11:18,783 --> 01:11:21,343
Eating Easter brunch with

1470
01:11:21,855 --> 01:11:22,879
Lonely

1471
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:24,415
Childless Ally

1472
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:27,743
Alex Jones

1473
01:11:28,255 --> 01:11:30,047
Oh do they have

1474
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:31,583
They have a new baby

1475
01:11:32,351 --> 01:11:33,119
Gross

1476
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:39,775
Poor bastard that babies going to be wearing a dick head that baby is due

1477
01:11:40,031 --> 01:11:41,311
Doing great

1478
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:43,359
Thrilled for that baby

1479
01:11:44,639 --> 01:11:46,175
But yeah you're right

1480
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:47,711
Going to wind up next

1481
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:48,735
Do the Super Bowl loser

1482
01:11:48,991 --> 01:11:52,575
Their t-shirts

1483
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:54,623
There's no way that like

1484
01:11:56,671 --> 01:11:57,183
Entirely

1485
01:11:57,439 --> 01:12:00,511
Elizabeth thought I was trying to get you is that this isn't the normal line

1486
01:12:01,023 --> 01:12:06,143
But it's still the normal desperation absolutely this is a desperate man

1487
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:08,447
Trying to come up with a PR stunt

1488
01:12:08,703 --> 01:12:10,495
Because everything is going down the tubes

1489
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:11,775
You need attention

1490
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:14,335
Because also he's not selling s***

1491
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:16,895
That's why everything has all the prices cut

1492
01:12:17,407 --> 01:12:18,943
That's why he needs to move product

1493
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:21,247
It is bullshiting everybody

1494
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:26,111
Like he's saying that he's building a new studio like a million-dollar Studio

1495
01:12:26,623 --> 01:12:27,135
You're not

1496
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:29,695
There's no way you're doing that

1497
01:12:30,463 --> 01:12:32,767
You shouldn't be building a million-dollar Studio

1498
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:35,327
Andrew the $200,000 contest

1499
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:37,631
It's not a $200,000

1500
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:40,703
Is a contest with a limit of $200,000

1501
01:12:41,215 --> 01:12:42,239
But all this is bulshit

1502
01:12:43,519 --> 01:12:45,311
Huge distraction

1503
01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:49,663
Crushing it

1504
01:12:49,919 --> 01:12:50,431
Or

1505
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:53,759
He would be the least lucky man is like it would be

1506
01:12:55,295 --> 01:12:56,063
200 people

1507
01:12:56,319 --> 01:12:58,367
The only 200 people who bought shirts

1508
01:12:58,623 --> 01:13:02,975
Who all somehow

1509
01:13:03,487 --> 01:13:04,767
See now that's how you jump-start the

1510
01:13:05,023 --> 01:13:09,119
Over and over again

1511
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:11,167
Now they got a limit one per person

1512
01:13:11,423 --> 01:13:14,239
I don't know about that let me look on the website

1513
01:13:14,751 --> 01:13:17,311
Let me see I know they absolutely do not

1514
01:13:17,823 --> 01:13:18,847
Absolutely.

1515
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:19,615
Sweet

1516
01:13:19,871 --> 01:13:21,919
Then we are buying one of those shirts I am not

It's not about something else

1537
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:22,335

We want to try and get people to do this for us cuz we're not going to do it

1541
01:15:28,895 --> 01:15:31,967
People to do this

01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:32,735
Yeah

1543
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:34,783

1545
01:15:38,623 --> 01:15:39,135
CNN

1546
01:15:39,647 --> 01:15:40,159
Come out

1547
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:41,439
And

1548
01:15:41,695 --> 01:15:42,975
Denounce terrorism

1549
01:15:43,743 --> 01:15:45,023
They do

1550
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:49,631
I think they support

1551
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:50,655
Isis

1552
01:15:50,911 --> 01:15:51,423

1555
01:15:58,079 --> 01:16:00,639
And then of course

1556
01:16:06,015 --> 01:16:08,319
Why won't scan and come out and renounce terrorism

1557
01:16:08,575 --> 01:16:09,087
They fired

1558
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:10,111
They fired her

1559
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:10,879

1562
01:16:17,023 --> 01:16:18,047
Well that's the problem they didn't

1563
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:23,167
Should be in jail

1564
01:16:23,423 --> 01:16:24,447
Brilliant

1565
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:27,007
I mean dogs

1566
01:16:27,519 --> 01:16:28,799

1567
01:16:29,311 --> 01:16:33,663
Is this is this the same as corsi pitching about how he's going to die last week

1568
01:16:33,919 --> 01:16:38,783
No no cuz this I think people might actually do that one was

1569
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:40,319
Just straight b*******

1570
01:16:40,575 --> 01:16:41,087
Alex

1571
01:16:41,599 --> 01:16:43,391
They really should have

1572
01:16:43,647 --> 01:16:49,791
Because then the next week you don't have to reveal the information that's Bumpass

1573
01:16:51,071 --> 01:16:54,399
Navigate to the bottom what the information was the course he died for

1574
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:56,703
You could do months of that

1575
01:16:56,959 --> 01:16:58,239
You still in there to cover it up

1576
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:05,919
No just don't take over for like a month

1577
01:17:06,175 --> 01:17:08,479
While you're on assignment to figure out

1578
01:17:08,735 --> 01:17:10,015

01:17:10,271 --> 01:17:14,367
You could do you could stay home drunk

1580
01:17:14,623 --> 01:17:16,159
And just do reports from the road like

1581
01:17:16,671 --> 01:17:20,511
I got to leave I talk to this legislator

01:17:40,991 --> 01:17:42,783
You could have just made it look like a heart attack

1586
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:44,575
He's already old

1587
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:49,951

8-day absolutely hate violin

1600

Giant gun

1602
01:19:18,015 --> 01:19:18,527
Silicone tape

You got to buy one

1606
01:19:30,303 --> 01:19:36,447
It's a collector's series forever I do

1607
01:19:36,703 --> 01:19:40,031
Those frosted glass

1608
01:19:43,103 --> 01:19:44,127
Suggest rethinking

1609
01:19:44,383 --> 01:19:46,431
Be homeless billboard strategy

1610
01:19:46,943 --> 01:19:48,223
A couple reasons

1611
01:19:52,575 --> 01:19:55,647
That's one thing another thing is it's really insulting

1612
01:19:55,903 --> 01:19:57,439
To think of the homeless at thing

1613
01:19:57,695 --> 01:19:58,975
Using

1614
01:19:59,231 --> 01:20:00,255
Walking billboards

1615
01:20:00,511 --> 01:20:01,279
So that's better

1616
01:20:01,791 --> 01:20:06,143
What sort of problematic

1617
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:07,423
Beyond that

1618
01:20:08,191 --> 01:20:11,007
I don't Clear Channel actually owns all the homeowner

1619
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:17,408
Channel locks donate to page to Jack FM

1620
01:20:19,968 --> 01:20:23,552
You've never gone up to a homeless person and seeing their shirt and been like

01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:28,416
I got to check this out

1622
01:20:29,696 --> 01:20:30,464

1625
01:20:39,424 --> 01:20:40,192
The dumbest idea

1626
01:20:41,728 --> 01:20:43,520
I love his excitement when he's like

1627
01:20:43,776 --> 01:20:49,920
I just thought of actually

1628
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:53,760

01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:59,648
Homeless people shirts

1632
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:03,232
Everybody could use more clothes out on the street stuff out there

1633
01:21:04,256 --> 01:21:06,560
I know plenty of homeless people who would still deny those

1634
01:21:07,072 --> 01:21:08,352
Inside out

1635
01:21:08,608 --> 01:21:10,400

1637
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:19,616
Cernovich breaks down some big news that he's gotten

01:21:19,872 --> 01:21:21,920
There's about the murders in Portland

1639
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:22,944
On the train

1640
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:26,272
It's about the big news out about this

01:21:26,528 --> 01:21:27,808
And I'll just let him break it for you

1642
01:21:33,952 --> 01:21:36,256
Was trying to

1643
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:44,192
12 year old punk

1644
01:21:44,448 --> 01:21:48,800

So Mike cernovich a lot of his sources end up being like doctored photos that he finds on 4chan

1648
01:22:27,712 --> 01:22:31,808
Right whenever he has something like this

1649
01:22:32,576 --> 01:22:33,600
Set my public service

1650
01:22:35,136 --> 01:22:36,928
It is true

1651
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:39,488
Support Bernie Sanders

1652
01:22:39,744 --> 01:22:44,352
Initially but I don't think that has anything to do with that anything in let's not belabor it

1653
01:22:47,936 --> 01:22:48,448
Discussing

1654
01:22:48,704 --> 01:22:52,800
Do you like Bernie irrelevant I don't care

1655
01:22:53,056 --> 01:22:56,384
He's a monster horrible bigot

1656
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:57,664
Is bigotry and bigot

1657
01:22:59,456 --> 01:23:00,992
I love I love that he's like

1658
01:23:01,248 --> 01:23:06,112

01:23:06,368 --> 01:23:10,720
Schedule Daddy

1660
01:23:13,024 --> 01:23:15,840
It was definitely isn't because he

01:23:16,096 --> 01:23:17,888
Ifucking murdered two people

1662
01:23:18,144 --> 01:23:19,936
The pile of garbage

1663
01:23:21,216 --> 01:23:24,032
I know that Alex thinks you being severe with his language but he's like

1664
01:23:24,288 --> 01:23:26,848
Now you're going to prison for twenty years dumbass

1665
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:28,896
It's almost like he's critiquing

1666
01:23:29,408 --> 01:23:30,944
You didn't do that right

1667
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:35,296
Weird mentally ill person

1668
01:23:37,088 --> 01:23:41,184
It's and it's not even any recognition of the tragic nature of what happened

1669
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:44,768
You can't even connect with that

1670
01:23:45,024 --> 01:23:46,048
He's talking about

1671
01:23:46,304 --> 01:23:47,584
The people that were killed

1672
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:48,352
A veteran

1673
01:23:48,608 --> 01:23:49,376
And

1674
01:23:49,632 --> 01:23:53,728
What was the other twenty-three-year-old

1675
01:23:53,984 --> 01:23:56,544
The guy who just graduated from college

1676
01:23:56,800 --> 01:24:01,664
Do not f****** pronounce though I've tried

1677
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:02,688
He murdered those two

1678
01:24:02,944 --> 01:24:03,456
Two people

1679
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:04,736
Because they were

1680
01:24:04,992 --> 01:24:05,760

There

1688
01:24:18,048 --> 01:24:18,816
That's what he wants

1689
01:24:19,072 --> 01:24:20,352
Stupid also liberal false flag

1690
01:24:20,608 --> 01:24:22,656
Yeah but he wants

1691
01:24:22,912 --> 01:24:24,192
Discover cuz what he really wants to do

1692
01:24:24,704 --> 01:24:25,728
Is pulled the same

1693
01:24:25,984 --> 01:24:26,752
It's at that like

Right

1698
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:33,664
He wants it to be

1699
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:34,432
He wanted to

1700
01:24:34,688 --> 01:24:36,480
Subway

1701
01:24:36,736 --> 01:24:37,760
You can't allow that white p

1702
01:24:38,528 --> 01:24:39,552
Would actually defend these

1703
01:24:40,064 --> 01:24:42,368
The people that he's so afraid of

1704
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:48,768
Muslim women are on the way out

1705
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:52,352
I'm out and you don't understand people would defend them

1706
01:24:53,888 --> 01:24:55,680
Gyros

1707
01:24:56,192 --> 01:25:00,032
He doesn't understand how his rhetoric in his beliefs that he espoused

1708
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:05,408
But I feel is really laggy

1709
01:25:05,664 --> 01:25:07,712
I don't feel like I've seen

1710
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:13,088
Fair enough

1711
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:14,880
The coverage that I've heard

1712
01:25:15,392 --> 01:25:17,440
Was something I was struck by

1713
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:19,488
At the realization that these

1714
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:21,280
These two poor girls

1715
01:25:21,536 --> 01:25:23,840
Are going to have to live the rest of their lives

1716
01:25:25,632 --> 01:25:27,936
They know that people died for them

1717
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:32,288
They shouldn't feel bad about

1718
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:33,824
It's not their fault

1719
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:35,104
Or anything like that

1720
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:37,664
But it's impossible as a human not to feel

1721
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:42,272
At least somehow it's going to take a lot of therapy to be okay with the situation that happened

1722
01:25:42,784 --> 01:25:45,088
I already

1723
01:25:45,344 --> 01:25:50,208
Had the thought

1724
01:25:50,464 --> 01:25:50,976
The thoughts

1725
01:25:53,024 --> 01:25:54,048
Why wasn't

1726
01:25:55,328 --> 01:25:56,864
Just that that survivor's guilt

1727
01:25:57,632 --> 01:25:58,144
It should have been

1728
01:26:03,008 --> 01:26:04,800
Especially in the like

1729
01:26:06,848 --> 01:26:07,360
You know the youth

1730
01:26:08,896 --> 01:26:09,664
It's processing

1731
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:10,432
Promotions

1732
01:26:10,688 --> 01:26:11,456
Be very difficult

1733
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:15,552
No matter what

1734
01:26:15,808 --> 01:26:17,344
There's there's nothing really

1735
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:18,880
Nothing good

1736
01:26:19,136 --> 01:26:21,440
No good feelings except for about that guy who survived

1737
01:26:23,488 --> 01:26:25,024
There's a pretty nice feelings about that

1738
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:26,048
Cuz at least

1739
01:26:26,304 --> 01:26:26,816
One person

1740
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:30,912
Start to finish

1741
01:26:33,984 --> 01:26:34,752
I will say I don't like this

1742
01:26:35,008 --> 01:26:35,520
The guy who survived

1743
01:26:36,032 --> 01:26:36,544
Slam Poet

1744
01:26:37,568 --> 01:26:41,408
I can say that that's one thing

1745
01:26:41,664 --> 01:26:47,808
All the horrible things that I have said that is the worst thing that's been said on this phone

1746
01:26:48,064 --> 01:26:54,208
I'm being facetious.

1747
01:26:54,464 --> 01:27:00,608
Slam poetry and I fell in

1748
01:27:04,704 --> 01:27:05,216
Insensitive

1749
01:27:05,728 --> 01:27:07,776
Mike cernovich leave the show

1750
01:27:08,032 --> 01:27:09,056
He is done

1751
01:27:09,312 --> 01:27:10,080
His shift

1752
01:27:12,384 --> 01:27:16,736
Any of the last clips that I have here

1753
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:19,552
I'm stuff

1754
01:27:19,808 --> 01:27:22,624
Here is how he comes back from break

1755
01:27:23,648 --> 01:27:24,160
Boy

1756
01:27:25,696 --> 01:27:26,464
It's a lot of

1757
01:27:27,232 --> 01:27:28,512
Loteria Nacional

1758
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:41,312
Points against

1759
01:27:41,568 --> 01:27:42,848
Boulder still Rising

1760
01:27:43,104 --> 01:27:46,688
Most dumbest

1761
01:27:46,944 --> 01:27:48,480
Stat on trendy's arm

1762
01:27:48,736 --> 01:27:50,784
Worship

1763
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:53,856
She's legitimately calling Terrace losers

1764
01:27:54,112 --> 01:27:58,976
Because that makes people did not do do it you call him dangerous and powerful word

1765
01:27:59,232 --> 01:28:01,536
Aldi's

1766
01:28:01,792 --> 01:28:05,120
All the same

1767
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:20,224
BFDI has profiles

1768
01:28:28,416 --> 01:28:34,560
Hidalgo blow-up little

1769
01:28:34,816 --> 01:28:36,352
Call Amor

1770
01:28:37,888 --> 01:28:39,424
I don't know kill everybody's f***

1771
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:40,192
Looking family

1772
01:28:41,472 --> 01:28:42,240
Drone strikes out of

1773
01:28:42,496 --> 01:28:43,520
F****** Noah

1774
01:28:43,776 --> 01:28:45,568
Why would you become a terrorist

1775
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:51,968
Because you're a loser fighting back against something

1776
01:28:52,224 --> 01:28:57,856
Evil empire that murdered everyone you know isn't it so Alex Jones

1777
01:28:58,112 --> 01:28:59,392
To think like the answer to terrorism

1778
01:28:59,904 --> 01:29:00,672
Bullying

1779
01:29:05,024 --> 01:29:07,584
You're afraid for the women don't want to have sex

1780
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:13,984
With you is killing people so caught up in his masculine narrative so caught up in his

1781
01:29:14,496 --> 01:29:15,264
Trappings he doesn't

1782
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:17,312
You can't be anything else

1783
01:29:17,824 --> 01:29:19,104
All he can see things through his

1784
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:21,408
The prism of white victimhood

1785
01:29:21,664 --> 01:29:22,944
And masculine fears

1786
01:29:23,456 --> 01:29:24,480
With all he's got

1787
01:29:24,736 --> 01:29:26,016
Everything goes through that prism

1788
01:29:26,272 --> 01:29:27,552
And it's so sad

1789
01:29:28,064 --> 01:29:29,344
It's so sad that that is

1790
01:29:30,112 --> 01:29:35,232
That is a deeply ingrained piece of him we speed in 2015 we see it now

1791
01:29:35,488 --> 01:29:36,256
Yeah

1792
01:29:36,768 --> 01:29:37,280
Attic

1793
01:29:37,792 --> 01:29:39,072
It's a little like

1794
01:29:39,328 --> 01:29:40,096
If you've ever

1795
01:29:43,424 --> 01:29:45,984
You have

1796
01:29:46,496 --> 01:29:48,288
The dog park

1797
01:29:51,872 --> 01:29:52,384
Cat guy

1798
01:29:54,432 --> 01:29:57,248
Very very defensive about it

1799
01:29:57,760 --> 01:30:02,112
I like at many high-profile men

1800
01:30:02,368 --> 01:30:03,136
Like cats

1801
01:30:04,416 --> 01:30:05,184
Go ahead

1802
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:09,792
I know you like dogs don't have fun

1803
01:30:12,352 --> 01:30:13,376
What is it what is it like

1804
01:30:13,632 --> 01:30:14,912
Like to see the world through

1805
01:30:15,168 --> 01:30:15,680
Zeiss

1806
01:30:16,192 --> 01:30:16,704
You know like

1807
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:17,472
They can't

1808
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:20,032
Color blind or whatever

1809
01:30:20,288 --> 01:30:21,312
Just their vision

1810
01:30:21,568 --> 01:30:22,080
Is different from

1811
01:30:22,592 --> 01:30:23,616
How is it that day

1812
01:30:24,896 --> 01:30:26,944
Yeah

1813
01:30:28,736 --> 01:30:29,248
Of course

1814
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:32,832
But I don't know why I chose.

1815
01:30:34,624 --> 01:30:35,392
It's okay

1816
01:30:39,232 --> 01:30:39,744
Attitude

1817
01:30:41,536 --> 01:30:42,560
Know that like

1818
01:30:42,816 --> 01:30:43,328
It must

1819
01:30:43,584 --> 01:30:44,608
It must be

1820
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:45,888
Weird

1821
01:30:46,144 --> 01:30:46,912
Fascinating

1822
01:30:47,168 --> 01:30:47,680
To try and

1823
01:30:47,936 --> 01:30:48,704
Steve the world

1824
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:49,472
True Alex Jones

1825
01:30:51,008 --> 01:30:51,520
Because

1826
01:30:52,032 --> 01:30:53,056
It's it's so

1827
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:57,920
And it's so divorced from reality you halfway expect

1828
01:30:58,176 --> 01:31:01,760
Like if you saw through his eyes for one second you halfway expect

1829
01:31:02,016 --> 01:31:02,528
Toosii

1830
01:31:02,784 --> 01:31:05,856
There are two suns in the sky and one of them is purple

1831
01:31:07,904 --> 01:31:08,416
To be this weird

1832
01:31:08,672 --> 01:31:09,184
Funhaus

1833
01:31:09,696 --> 01:31:10,720
Mirror's Edge

1834
01:31:10,976 --> 01:31:13,536
Situation you almost wonder if he has a tumor or something like

1835
01:31:13,792 --> 01:31:14,816
Like that

1836
01:31:16,608 --> 01:31:21,472
It's not though it's just cultural cultural conditioning

1837
01:31:21,728 --> 01:31:22,752
Such like

1838
01:31:23,264 --> 01:31:25,568
I mean we've solved the mystery about his psyche

1839
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:28,640
The minute we found that clip about his mom

1840
01:31:28,896 --> 01:31:29,408
That is

1841
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:33,504
Where's a lot of this comes from not a racial stuff I'm not entirely sure

1842
01:31:44,512 --> 01:31:47,840
Maybe there's some parental situation

1843
01:31:48,096 --> 01:31:48,608
Is that wound up

1844
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:50,912
I've been using the n-word

1845
01:31:51,424 --> 01:31:53,728
I don't know I don't want to put that on his parents I don't know that for sure

1846
01:31:53,984 --> 01:31:55,264
Maybe an uncle

1847
01:31:57,312 --> 01:31:58,080
Uzbek klip

1848
01:31:58,592 --> 01:31:59,104

You want to tell me what's really

1851
01:32:03,456 --> 01:32:03,968
You know what

1852
01:32:06,528 --> 01:32:08,064
You don't have it I really threw me off with

1853
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:09,600
The cat say

1854
01:32:09,856 --> 01:32:11,648
Turn myself off I misspoke

1855
01:32:11,904 --> 01:32:12,672
Cernovich is still around

1856
01:32:13,184 --> 01:32:17,024
He was held over when Rodger Stone shows up

1857
01:32:17,536 --> 01:32:19,584
And the three of them are are there

1858
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:20,864
There's brownout

01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:23,680
This the next clip is Mike cernovich

1860
01:32:24,192 --> 01:32:24,704
Certifix

1861
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:25,472
Explaining

1862
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:27,776
What are the Kathy Griffin picture

1863
01:32:28,032 --> 01:32:28,544
It was all about

1864
01:32:29,312 --> 01:32:31,104
Cuz I don't I don't

1865
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:31,872
Transparent

1866
01:32:32,128 --> 01:32:35,456
And obviously I don't think that you like really are able

1867
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:36,992
The Dakota

1868
01:32:38,016 --> 01:32:39,040
Wasn't that difficult

1869
01:32:40,064 --> 01:32:41,856
Well I don't know if you came to this conclusion

1870
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:46,208
There's a big

1871
01:32:46,464 --> 01:32:49,536
Apogee

1872
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:01,312
Did you come up with that analysis

1873
01:33:01,568 --> 01:33:02,080
Get that one

1874
01:33:02,592 --> 01:33:03,104
That one

1875
01:33:03,616 --> 01:33:04,128
You're right

1876
01:33:04,384 --> 01:33:08,992
Damn right I was I thought it was a very simple and direct message and apparently

1877
01:33:09,504 --> 01:33:11,040
It was a secret communicate

1878
01:33:11,552 --> 01:33:12,832
Expressing love for Islip

1879
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:17,184
Cuz you had too much fluoride

1880
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:18,720
Deep Earth iodine

1881
01:33:18,976 --> 01:33:21,024
So this is more about the

1882
01:33:21,536 --> 01:33:22,048
Action with ISIS

1883
01:33:24,864 --> 01:33:29,216
It's unfortunate he doesn't know that has already fired her while they're recording the

1884
01:33:42,528 --> 01:33:43,552
Wichita

1885
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:53,792
You're totally right

1886
01:33:54,304 --> 01:33:55,328
Of course but again

1887
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:56,608
They've already fired

1888
01:33:57,888 --> 01:33:58,656
But they

1889
01:33:59,936 --> 01:34:00,448
It took them

1890
01:34:01,472 --> 01:34:01,984
A few hours

1891
01:34:02,496 --> 01:34:03,520
I did not few hours

1892
01:34:04,544 --> 01:34:05,056
They signaled

1893
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:07,616
For sure

1894
01:34:07,872 --> 01:34:11,712
For sure turn off those beacons

1895
01:34:11,968 --> 01:34:13,248
Before now it's

1896
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:14,272
Almost

1897
01:34:18,368 --> 01:34:20,672
So I'm an expert we got way more projector

1898
01:34:21,184 --> 01:34:21,696
Lotaburger

1899
01:34:22,208 --> 01:34:22,976
But you might as well

1900
01:34:23,232 --> 01:34:24,000
I work at a movie theater

1901
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:28,608
Because

1902
01:34:29,376 --> 01:34:32,448
They know Prosperity is out competing their authoritarian model

1903
01:34:34,752 --> 01:34:39,104
Energetic

1904
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:47,296
Feel it being lifted bad but now it's what to do

1905
01:34:47,808 --> 01:34:53,184
Our forces that are makes more money

1906
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:59,584
American System

1907
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:01,120
It's so much better

1908
01:35:01,632 --> 01:35:07,008
So the sexiest of America

1909
01:35:07,264 --> 01:35:12,896
And the return

1910
01:35:13,152 --> 01:35:19,040
Everything I realized incredible

1911
01:35:19,552 --> 01:35:21,856
How to fight that in the first place

1912
01:35:22,112 --> 01:35:23,392
Well they're word like things

1913
01:35:23,648 --> 01:35:24,672
Came out about Mike

1914
01:35:24,928 --> 01:35:25,696
Modern Art

1915
01:35:25,952 --> 01:35:29,536
And stuff like that there were CIA operations that had to do with like trying to

1916
01:35:29,792 --> 01:35:30,304
Injec

1917
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:31,072
Random

1918
01:35:31,328 --> 01:35:33,632
Weird things to see if they can get them to be popular

1919
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:35,680
Do not know about that

1920
01:35:36,192 --> 01:35:39,776
I don't know enough to speak about it but I read an article about it a while back there

1921
01:35:40,032 --> 01:35:40,544
There is

1922
01:35:41,056 --> 01:35:42,080
There is that but the

1923
01:35:44,128 --> 01:35:46,688
Rosebud variance

1924
01:35:46,944 --> 01:35:53,088
They were still trying to figure out what they were doing

1925
01:36:00,256 --> 01:36:04,352
Extrapolate that we're going on

1926
01:36:04,864 --> 01:36:08,192
You out so trying to sell ugly things

1927
01:36:09,472 --> 01:36:13,824
Deep Earth iodine is that at the beginning of a clip

1928
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:15,360
He's talked about how I

1929
01:36:15,616 --> 01:36:17,152
I have felt their will

1930
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:19,456
And it's

1931
01:36:19,968 --> 01:36:20,736
Yeah exactly

1932
01:36:20,992 --> 01:36:22,272
You

1933
01:36:26,368 --> 01:36:29,440
Wait for him to experience his feelings like

1934
01:36:29,696 --> 01:36:31,488
Through the prism of somebody else

1935
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:35,328
Speedball negative feelings must be ascribed to the global

1936
01:36:38,144 --> 01:36:39,168
Figure that one out

1937
01:36:39,424 --> 01:36:45,568
I don't actually know if that's true I was just listen to

1938
01:36:45,824 --> 01:36:49,664
A bunch of

1939
01:36:50,176 --> 01:36:54,272
Episode

1940
01:36:54,784 --> 01:36:58,112
No that's it that's a really fascinating thing I don't know if that's accurate

1941
01:36:58,368 --> 01:37:01,440
But it would be it would be interesting to go back in

1942
01:37:01,696 --> 01:37:03,744
Seattle on my investigation

1943
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,536
Keep note

1944
01:37:05,792 --> 01:37:08,096
Yeah but like

1945
01:37:08,608 --> 01:37:10,912
Whenever there are negative things it must be something

1946
01:37:11,168 --> 01:37:12,448
Globalist

1947
01:37:12,704 --> 01:37:13,728
As opposed to

1948
01:37:14,496 --> 01:37:16,288
Part of the randomness of life

1949
01:37:17,312 --> 01:37:19,872
The consequence consequence of some good thing

1950
01:37:20,128 --> 01:37:22,432
Write classic

1951
01:37:22,944 --> 01:37:23,456
Symptom of MRSA

1952
01:37:23,968 --> 01:37:24,480
Personality

1953
01:37:24,992 --> 01:37:26,016
Or just illusion

1954
01:37:30,368 --> 01:37:30,880
I can imagine

1955
01:37:31,648 --> 01:37:32,672
Really did he is

1956
01:37:32,928 --> 01:37:36,256
All of these signs

1957
01:37:36,768 --> 01:37:40,864
What is manic depressive

1958
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:42,656
Even still have manic episodes

1959
01:37:43,424 --> 01:37:44,960
And it could be caused by

1960
01:37:45,216 --> 01:37:45,984
Long Bender

1961
01:37:46,752 --> 01:37:48,288
Followed by some cocaine

1962
01:37:51,104 --> 01:37:53,408
I will snort the super male vitality

1963
01:37:54,432 --> 01:37:55,456
Or Superman vitality

1964
01:37:56,992 --> 01:37:57,504
Play

1965
01:37:58,784 --> 01:37:59,296
Coke with super

1966
01:37:59,552 --> 01:38:00,064
Female vitality

1967
01:38:00,576 --> 01:38:01,344
It's a liquid

1968
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:02,112
We'll see that's

1969
01:38:02,368 --> 01:38:03,136
What you doing

1970
01:38:03,392 --> 01:38:06,720
Take a couple of take a couple bumps of Coke

1971
01:38:06,976 --> 01:38:09,792
Super male Vitality up there

1972
01:38:10,048 --> 01:38:11,584
And you get none of the negative effects

1973
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:12,352
Mexico

1974
01:38:12,608 --> 01:38:13,120
Sometimes

1975
01:38:14,656 --> 01:38:16,704
Superman

1976
01:38:17,216 --> 01:38:19,008
Rob Dyrdek's wife can agree

1977
01:38:20,288 --> 01:38:23,872
Cocaine and then the email is the numbers

1978
01:38:24,128 --> 01:38:27,712
Pitman arm

1979
01:38:27,968 --> 01:38:29,504
Declassified

1980
01:38:32,064 --> 01:38:38,208
We've come to our last clip here and it is towards the end of the show accidentally finds out

1981
01:38:38,464 --> 01:38:41,024
The Kathy Griffin has already been filed

1982
01:38:42,048 --> 01:38:47,680
You about that in your back pocket the whole time well it's the end of what's interesting about the show

1983
01:38:48,704 --> 01:38:49,216
So

1984
01:38:49,472 --> 01:38:49,984

1985
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:56,384

1986
01:39:00,992 --> 01:39:03,040
Can we bring Alex to figure this out cuz

1987
01:39:03,296 --> 01:39:05,088
His whole thing is is f*****

1988
01:39:05,344 --> 01:39:06,880
His whole point

1989
01:39:07,136 --> 01:39:07,904
Flick no

1990
01:39:08,416 --> 01:39:11,488
There's no point now he's going to have to really try and aggressive

1991
01:39:11,744 --> 01:39:12,768
Sibley post to story

1992
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:13,792

01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:19,168
Deals with the news

1994

Isis

01:39:43,232 --> 01:39:48,096
Humble

01:39:48,864 --> 01:39:50,144
Make a shirt

2002
01:39:51,680 --> 01:39:52,704
We need funding

2003
01:39:57,056 --> 01:40:01,920
Million-dollar contest

Sade

2007
01:40:12,928 --> 01:40:18,560
The last hour and a half two hours I've been screaming about how we're going to ruin her

2008
01:40:20,864 --> 01:40:22,912
Are there any

2009
01:40:23,168 --> 01:40:28,544
To like what about this guy on NBC or MSNBC

2010
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:30,080
Is Malcolm Nance

2011
01:40:30,336 --> 01:40:31,616
That's not what he saying

2012
01:40:32,128 --> 01:40:33,664

The cleaners

2016
01:40:48,256 --> 01:40:50,304
What about

2017
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:56,704
Does that count

2018
01:40:57,984 --> 01:40:59,008
That would be great

2019
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:06,944
Pictures of Dan we're going to perform at the Laugh Factory again

2020
01:41:10,016 --> 01:41:11,296
So smoothly into an ad

2021
01:41:13,856 --> 01:41:20,000
It's not even an ad so much as it is like we need money

2022
01:41:20,256 --> 01:41:23,840
It does like selling products and what have you been

2023
01:41:24,096 --> 01:41:25,888
Clearly is leading with

2024
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:28,704
Give us money it's less about you need the product

2025
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:30,496
Morwenna sucked money

2026
01:41:30,752 --> 01:41:33,312
We need money through this whole thing

2027
01:41:33,568 --> 01:41:36,640
He saw this Kathy Griffin you misread it real hard

2028
01:41:36,896 --> 01:41:39,712
I thought it was going to be the biggest scandal in the world

2029
01:41:39,968 --> 01:41:44,832
F****** episode talk to crnkovich about it they came up with this

2030
01:41:45,088 --> 01:41:46,624
Amazing plan

2031
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:47,648
I8

2032
01:41:47,904 --> 01:41:48,928
A0

2033
01:41:49,184 --> 01:41:49,696
God

2034
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:52,768
Man I hope he loses

2035
01:41:55,328 --> 01:41:59,424
He's a freelancer freelancer

2036
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:00,448
His ability to shop on

2037
01:42:01,472 --> 01:42:04,032
Yeah

2038
01:42:04,544 --> 01:42:05,824
Cuz he does do the 4th h a

2039
01:42:06,336 --> 01:42:10,688
Oh yeah

2040
01:42:10,944 --> 01:42:16,832
Since our last episode from Rebel media

2041
01:42:17,088 --> 01:42:18,624
Probably because of the macron league

2042
01:42:20,416 --> 01:42:24,000
Because he followed by his report.

2043
01:42:24,512 --> 01:42:29,120
He's too truthful I also it's come to my attention that Lauren Southern is gone

2044
01:42:29,376 --> 01:42:32,448
We discussed.

2045
01:42:32,704 --> 01:42:35,264
Not sure if she's up to but still probably

2046
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:36,544
The rabble-rousing

2047
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:42,432
Yeah also what was the other one I could do

2048
01:42:42,688 --> 01:42:46,272
Extended Hiatus from

2049
01:42:46,528 --> 01:42:48,064
Does baby

2050
01:42:48,832 --> 01:42:49,600
No

2051
01:42:50,112 --> 01:42:50,624
Okay

2052
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:54,720
How dare you

2053
01:42:55,488 --> 01:43:00,864
You're just mad at the idea

2054
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:01,632
Average

2055
01:43:02,144 --> 01:43:05,728
I'm not that guy I'm not that guy

2056
01:43:06,240 --> 01:43:08,032
But I do believe that you single

2057
01:43:08,288 --> 01:43:10,336
Okay

2058
01:43:10,848 --> 01:43:13,408
We wouldn't get along

2059
01:43:19,296 --> 01:43:22,880
I would say that my hypothetical relationship with Leon McAdoo would go better

2060
01:43:23,136 --> 01:43:25,440
Then this Kathy Griffin

2061
01:43:25,952 --> 01:43:27,488
I'm pretty certain of that

2062
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:28,512
Awesome

2063
01:43:28,768 --> 01:43:30,816
Good luck Alex I don't think

2064
01:43:31,072 --> 01:43:35,680
That you're going to be able to distract people from the Russia investigation

2065
01:43:36,448 --> 01:43:37,472
Isaac

2066
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:43,360
Distracting your listeners from the fact that you did not pay off the course

2067
01:43:44,384 --> 01:43:46,176
I don't think that anyone is

2068
01:43:46,432 --> 01:43:47,712
Anymore

2069
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:50,784
Cuz no one else is listening critically

2070
01:43:53,088 --> 01:43:55,648
I went to their subreddit I went to the

2071
01:43:55,904 --> 01:43:58,720
Infowars subreddits and people weren't talking about it

2072
01:43:58,976 --> 01:44:01,280
Not at all

2073
01:44:01,792 --> 01:44:03,072
Is there followers

2074
01:44:04,096 --> 01:44:08,448
New cycle is so fast now who knows who might be dead

2075
01:44:09,216 --> 01:44:09,728
Could be anybody

2076
01:44:10,752 --> 01:44:12,288
Yesterday its course

2077
01:44:12,544 --> 01:44:14,336
Tomorrow is Alex Jones

2078
01:44:14,592 --> 01:44:16,640
The day after that Alex Jones kills Kursi

2079
01:44:16,896 --> 01:44:17,664
Anything Could Happen

2080
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:21,248
The thing I was of course he dies now there's no game

2081
01:44:21,504 --> 01:44:22,016
Yeah I know

2082
01:44:22,784 --> 01:44:25,088
Cuz it's already expiration date

2083
01:44:28,160 --> 01:44:30,464
You know a bunch of nonsense

2084
01:44:32,256 --> 01:44:33,024
Yeah

2085
01:44:33,792 --> 01:44:34,304
Like

2086
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:36,608
I don't know what to do

2087
01:44:36,864 --> 01:44:37,376
Do

2088
01:44:37,632 --> 01:44:38,912
This is so stupid

2089
01:44:39,168 --> 01:44:40,192
Like not the show

2090
01:44:42,496 --> 01:44:44,544
The last couple days on Infowars

2091
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:45,568
Has been like

2092
01:44:46,592 --> 01:44:47,872
What is you doing

2093
01:44:48,384 --> 01:44:51,968
B like Rick Derringer interviews and s*** like that

2094
01:44:52,992 --> 01:44:55,040
He was kind of hard but at the same time

2095
01:44:55,296 --> 01:44:55,808
You're supposed

2096
01:44:56,064 --> 01:44:58,624
To be a hard-hitting

2097
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:00,160
I meant today with this

2098
01:45:00,928 --> 01:45:02,208
Like I don't know

2099
01:45:02,464 --> 01:45:07,840
Like we we've cut into your regular MSN be brought MSNBC broadcast to bring you

2100
01:45:08,096 --> 01:45:08,864
HR puffin

2101
01:45:11,936 --> 01:45:12,960
You know like it's

2102
01:45:16,288 --> 01:45:16,800
That

2103
01:45:17,056 --> 01:45:18,080
Absurd

2104
01:45:18,848 --> 01:45:19,616
This f******

2105
01:45:20,128 --> 01:45:23,712
Weird Telethon move the T-shirt contest

2106
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:26,528
This isn't like

2107
01:45:27,296 --> 01:45:28,064
I want him

2108
01:45:28,832 --> 01:45:29,600
Same thing

2109
01:45:30,624 --> 01:45:31,136
Disprove

2110
01:45:34,464 --> 01:45:36,000
We disprove this shirt is a good idea

2111
01:45:36,256 --> 01:45:42,400
We've certainly indicated the likelihood that is

2112
01:45:42,656 --> 01:45:43,936
Undisprovable

2113
01:45:44,192 --> 01:45:48,288
CNN is Isis is not even a claim that's worth disproving cuz they're not

2114
01:45:50,848 --> 01:45:51,872
Pretty simple

2115
01:45:52,128 --> 01:45:53,920
Let me ask you a question how much research

2116
01:45:54,176 --> 01:45:54,688
Did you have to do

2117
01:45:54,944 --> 01:45:55,456
Before you came to the

2118
01:45:55,712 --> 01:45:56,224
Conclusion

2119
01:45:58,016 --> 01:46:00,064
None

2120
01:46:01,088 --> 01:46:03,392
I think that's why you're really unhappy you don't have

2121
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:10,304
You're just like god dammit I want to research the dumb s*** you say well it's fun for me when I can come to the episodes and be like

2122
01:46:11,072 --> 01:46:12,096
You're busted

2123
01:46:12,608 --> 01:46:18,752
That is not why the NRA started things are really fun

2124
01:46:19,008 --> 01:46:20,032
Dumbass

2125
01:46:22,336 --> 01:46:23,360
I don't have to tiptoe

2126
01:46:23,616 --> 01:46:29,760
6 of a cup that giving t-shirts to the homeless as walking Billboards is a bad business strategy I just assumed that it is

2127
01:46:30,016 --> 01:46:35,648
Because I wouldn't buy anything it's advertised on a human

2128
01:46:35,904 --> 01:46:37,696
I don't I don't does not like

2129
01:46:40,768 --> 01:46:42,304
Well here's here's what

2130
01:46:42,816 --> 01:46:43,328
I'm a little bit

2131
01:46:44,352 --> 01:46:46,400
Is the more this goes on

2132
01:46:46,656 --> 01:46:47,680
The less we are

2133
01:46:47,936 --> 01:46:48,448
Combating right way

2134
01:46:48,704 --> 01:46:49,472
Wing propaganda

2135
01:46:49,984 --> 01:46:50,752
And the more we're laughing at

2136
01:46:51,264 --> 01:46:51,776
Mentally ill person

2137
01:46:52,288 --> 01:46:53,568
Yeah that is true

2138
01:46:53,824 --> 01:46:56,128
I mean he'll be back off this manic episode

2139
01:46:56,384 --> 01:46:57,408
Certainly before too long

2140
01:46:58,688 --> 01:47:00,224
Usually

2141
01:47:00,992 --> 01:47:02,272
Couple weeks boy

2142
01:47:02,528 --> 01:47:03,808
Yeah boy

2143
01:47:04,832 --> 01:47:10,464
So who knows for the next couple weeks

2144
01:47:11,488 --> 01:47:17,632
Sick of it says we might be doing

2145
01:47:17,888 --> 01:47:19,424
