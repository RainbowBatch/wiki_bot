1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Damn important

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for knowledge B I'm sick of them

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,136
Dot-com

5
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:02,464
Acknowledge

6
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,560
Looks around at novelty Beverages and talk a little bit about Alex Jones

7
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:12,960
What's up cereals

8
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:20,640
I have gone wild radio serials like the shadow like that was what I was saying

9
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:25,760
I mentioned to you that I have been

10
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:27,808
Exploring the world of ordering grocery

11
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:30,368
Cindy for the sake of safety

12
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,208
More Brown

13
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:36,512
Then maybe I'm used to it a grocery store

14
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:41,888
I kind of get in and get out at a grocery store generally I kind of know what I'm looking

15
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,680
Infor

16
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:44,704
Eat that many

17
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:48,800
Wearing blinders at the grocery store the frozen pizza section

18
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:49,824
Conjunctiva

19
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:51,616
And go home

20
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:53,920
Browsing through I've noticed

21
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:56,480
But there are a number of cereals now

22
00:01:56,736 --> 00:02:02,112
That really excite me but also offend me

23
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:04,416
These are the cereals where everybody

24
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:05,696
He's playing each other's game

25
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:12,352
How come everyone is in each other's lanes and I don't know what's going on is like

26
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:17,728
Kellogg's Rice Krispies will suddenly have like a peanut butter balls

27
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,264
Hopscotch

28
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:25,664
They have like Fruit Loops with marshmallows

29
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:29,248
And it's weird because like when I was

30
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:31,808
The kid I probably would have loved this

31
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:35,392
Yeah but now it now is 36

32
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:37,952
Gotta gotta try it

33
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:43,072
Everybody's fighting on a corner wall

34
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,608
What's the drug war mall over

35
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:50,240
One thing I was thinking about doing but I'm not sure I'm going to be able to pull it off because I don't know if I'll actually be able to

36
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,520
How to get all of them

37
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:55,616
And I don't know how many of these hybrids there are but it seems like there's a bug

38
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,432
I was thinking about trying to get a bunch and

39
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:00,992
Seeing who steals other people's gimmicks

40
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:03,040
Best okay like alright

41
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,600
Does Frosted Flakes

42
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:09,184
Is that improved with marshmallows

43
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:11,744
I don't know how it would work and I know you the chocolate Frost

44
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,304
I tried those

45
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,840
They're delicious

46
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:22,240
For the first three bites and then you're like I'm not four years old anymore so this much sugar is going to kill me yeah

47
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:25,824
I think there's probably a lot of that is what I would find

48
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,592
I did

49
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:27,872
Get the

50
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,664
The Lucky Charms

51
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,712
But with like the

52
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:32,736
The regular

53
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:35,552
Pieces that aren't marshmallows who are short hard like honey

54
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:37,856
No

55
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,000
I like regular looking

56
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:47,072
They're good

57
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:49,888
Do you like how many people are trying new stuff whatever it's like

58
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:50,656
Guys

59
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:52,704
I have been with Lucky Charms for foot

60
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,496
It's like I've been smoking Newports

61
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:58,592
Since I was nine years old and you guys are going to come up with some b******* like the Camel Crush

62
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:00,896
That's the first time the Camel Crush happening like this isn't

63
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:04,736
Affront against God how dare you combine these two flavors

64
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,040
But then

65
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:14,976
My bright spot Dan is the Avalanches release a new album

66
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:19,327
The Avalanches released two albums in one decade

67
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,119
Blowin your mind is

68
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,399
Yeah I was like wow

69
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:28,799
15 years between you and whatever they came out with

70
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:34,175
And then just now we Will Always Love You released

71
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:40,575
Friday absolutely fantastic school I don't want to be a hater but I didn't really like their second album as much

72
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:43,391
I like since I left you second I used to

73
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:49,279
Smoke a lot of weed when I was younger I left you is kind of genre busting in that they really

74
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,559
Took sampling too far

75
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:51,839
Yeah they were like paste

76
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:52,607
What if

77
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:54,911
I know you like he amen break and will

78
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:55,935
Strengthening

79
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:57,471
Instead we took 48

80
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:00,543
Ms and combined with 48 MS

81
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:06,943
Top 10 million other songs like I was just the right age and like I said smoke weed

82
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,015
Frontier psychiatrist like blew my mind everybody

83
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:16,927
Music videos

84
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:17,695
Totally

85
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:21,791
I don't know how any other album Bay made could not kind of be a letdown

86
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:25,119
Based on the experience of that at that time

87
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,911
But I'll try

88
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:33,311
An open mind for this other new one

89
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:37,663
Music forever and then their next album was a really good album if you're good

90
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,431
Producers but they

91
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,199
It's not

92
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:42,783
You know I can get on real busting era-defining South I think

93
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,063
The problem is the

94
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:44,831
Decade in

95
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:47,647
Between like if you put out a sophomore album

96
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:49,695
It's just serviceable or just good

97
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:52,511
Sure next 2 years

98
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,791
Understandable then like

99
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:58,143
Waiting for Chinese Democracy just being

100
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:00,191
Do that

101
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:03,775
That is fair

102
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:08,895
It's got a bunch of really good guests on it they do a lot of like

103
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:11,967
Classic trip hop seven almost SoundCloud

104
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:16,063
Play It's Tricky

105
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,391
They got some disco and then they got some classic Avalanches walk

106
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:21,439
Can songs which is what the Avalanches do bad

107
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:22,463
I'll check it out

108
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:25,791

109
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:26,815

Money off that heroin

Dollartree.com

155
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:41,983
Or what you could do is

156
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:45,311
You can go to a record store go back into the back part of the Wrecker

157
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:51,711
Good stores start searching through all your favorite bands maybe some disco bands

158
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:58,111
People haven't seen find some generosity in their little bit to the best generosity from each one of those little crates

159
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:02,463
Over their combined it together to make something amazingly generous and take it

160
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,999
To your local bail fund or

161
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,559
Tip

162
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,375
Jordan

163
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,143
Today

164
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:10,911
What about it

165
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:13,215
We are going to be talking about

166
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:14,751
The rallies

167
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,567
What happened to DC over the weekend

168
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:20,895
One thing that's really difficult for me is I'm not

169
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:23,711
Going to be addressing really the

170
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:24,479
Street violin

171
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:27,551
That is a failing of our show to Anna

172
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:30,367
Extent because I don't have enough time

173
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,647
To get into it

174
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:34,719
I'm not on her show I mean in terms of like cover it

175
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:36,511
With the seriousness

176
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:39,583
The the focus that I think

177
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,399
Think the topic deserve where is silly show about Alex

178
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:43,935
Yes I don't want

179
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,983
To give short shrift

180
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:48,287
Do that but at the same time

181
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:51,871
It's all slightly outside of what I have the time to

182
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:56,479
To cover half-assing it is sometimes worse than doing anything at all

183
00:09:56,735 --> 00:10:01,855
But I did not want people to think that turn a blind eye to that kind of thing or or

184
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:03,135
Tacitly accept

185
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,415
Such

186
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:12,863
Jordan on Saturday there were multiple rallies that were happening in d.c. surrounding the idea that this election

187
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,143
Had been stolen

188
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,935
Stop that steel you know what I'm saying

189
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:20,799
Sure they're both about the same thing had the same theme and even featured some overlapping speakers

190
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,591
It was super confusing

191
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,871
But I think I know what was up

192
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:27,455
What are the rallies of being held by the women for America first

193
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,735
The group that formed out of

194
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:32,319
The Tea Party would just trying to use these protests and some of this unrest

195
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:34,367
To secure more power for the Republica

196
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:39,999
Can party while simultaneously trying to make the Republican party as weird as possible like they did with the pee part

197
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:40,767
Correct

198
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:42,303
The other rally was called

199
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,583
The Jericho March

200
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,655
Which made no secret about just being an overtly

201
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,447
Christian extremist rally

202
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:50,495
Put some really outrageous plan speakers

203
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:53,567
Well if I remember my story of Jericho well

204
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,871
I believe those people where the nights

205
00:10:56,383 --> 00:11:01,247
Decided to end the siege with negotiating

206
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,527
Coming to AAA

207
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,087
Fair solution for both parties right

208
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:09,183
Jericho March and Ali Alexander

209
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,975
Girlfriend from Infowars rate

210
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:13,023
They also have the Cowboys for Trump

211
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,863
Congressmember Paul gosar

212
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,167
It's really hard for me to tell what

213
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,447
Exactly what's going on

214
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:23,007
These two were opposing rally

215
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:29,151
Your Instinct review think that the Jericho March was for the religious zealots where is me women for America

216
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:31,455
The first will be the more restrained one

217
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:37,087
But honestly the rallies were almost identical

218
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:41,439
Not all the same people but it's the same

219
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:44,511
Both featured Mike Flynn given the same speed

220
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:49,887
Both had appearances from and got funding from the my pillow guy

221
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,423
Overwhelmingly really

222
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,983
Watching these rallies one

223
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:56,543
It's abundantly clear to me that something

224
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:00,127
That is very important for us to bring up his

225
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,919
We're not dealing with Paula

226
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:02,943
Tixier at all

227
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:03,711
This is not

228
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:07,551
This is a cult with some interest in politics as a means

229
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,319
To gaining

230
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,855
And retaining power

231
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:12,415
I don't really know how to talk about

232
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:13,951
Without like

233
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:18,303
I don't know I don't know how I don't I don't know how to engage with the ideas of a cult

234
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,095
I mean I think

235
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:22,911
The best way to engage with the ideas of cult

236
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,703
Is on a grand scale and what we should

237
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:31,103
To do to stimulate the economy is train 50% of the country in cult deprogramming to help them with the other 50 per

238
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:35,199
Like the new deal I think that's a good way to do it it's like the works progress administration

239
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:40,319
It's just it's really difficult because it comes off or it

240
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,855
Can be like Michigan

241
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,647
Construed as attacking religion

242
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:50,047
Show me with tack this kind of thing that's going on and I don't have any interest in attacking religion or Christianity I have a

243
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,071
Problem with what

244
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:51,839
This is

245
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,631
That's Tuff

246
00:12:54,143 --> 00:13:00,287
The 10-year person say that Bill Gates said X Y or Z an interview it's really easy to go find that interview and just

247
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,311
Discuss what's going on

248
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:05,919
What do we cure that same person say that God has chosen Donald Trump to be president

249
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:09,503
It's not too difficult to save their bit of a fanatic and I probably unwell

250
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:10,783
The difficulty

251
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:13,087
Becomes when there are two moles

252
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:16,671
The our rallies attended by thousands of people where the speakers

253
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:20,511
Heatedly it incessantly insist that God has chosen Trump to be president

254
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,791
And everyone cheers

255
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:22,815
That's

256
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:23,583
Tough

257
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,375
That is really f***** up

258
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,143
Yeah

259
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,983
We know where Alex is at we know where his head is we know what he's up to

260
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:33,055
Hey that's all I thought maybe a good use of our time today would be to

261
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:35,103
To look at these rallies themselves

262
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,663
Assess where we're at with all the

263
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,967
And see if it's something that we can

264
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:42,271
Learn to talk about a little bit better

265
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,039
And

266
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:45,087
See if there's anybody who pops up

267
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:45,855
Who is a

268
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:49,951
Particularly good crazy though good maybe there'll be somebody who's like

269
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:53,279
This is

270
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:57,119
Daryl is

271
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:03,519
Hangouts

272
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:07,359
No but I figure like hey you've got

273
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,127
1

274
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,431
I think each rally was at least

275
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:12,223
4 hours long Cheese's

276
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:16,063
You got a lot of speakers maybe somebody is going to be like

277
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:16,831
Alright

278
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:20,671
You got something I bet you got a weirdness out I'm going to be in

279
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:23,487
Alright that's worth our time

280
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:26,815
So we're going to start here Jordan with the Jericho March

281
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,631
This was hosted by Eric metaxas

282
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:34,495
Kind of aware of who this guy is he's like a Christian writer and a radio host

283
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:37,055
But I really don't know what time about him

284
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,591
Based on his work m

285
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:39,359
I'm seeing this event

286
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,895
That will probably be the way it

287
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:44,223
It's days because this dude is straight-up boring as hell

288
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:47,039
A whole lot of awful stage patter type

289
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,063
Material and then

290
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:50,111
Just calls to praise the Lord

291
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:53,183
We're starting with the one that's more it

292
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,719
Who is Italy religion

293
00:14:56,511 --> 00:15:02,655
And and you get that right from there we're going to get some Ace Frehley band talk and then we're going to smooth into the

294
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,751
How dare you

295
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,871
Yes it does have something she needs to get off his chest

296
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:18,271
Becomes anxiety what's up DC alcohol

297
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:25,695
You alright let's overthrow democracy forever

298
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:32,863
Call Jeff alright no it doesn't start with that

299
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:34,911
We are here

300
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:36,703
Because we loved

301
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,983
The god of the Bible

302
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,031
We are here

303
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,055
Because we believe

304
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,359
He is the god of History

305
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:46,175
We're here because we know

306
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,455
But he is the god

307
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:48,735
Who does

308
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:49,759
Real

309
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,039
Miracles

310
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:54,367
When his Remnant Cries Out

311
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,135
To him

312
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,159
In humility

313
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,439
And love

314
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:58,719
And says

315
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,999
Abba Father

316
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,535
We need you ABBA

317
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:02,303
Call Father

318
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,327
We are here too

319
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,095
Today

320
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,423
To the god of Heaven

321
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:08,959
To ask him

322
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:10,495
To have mercy

323
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,799
On the greatest nation in the

324
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:13,823
History of the world

325
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,103
Just pretty

326
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:19,455
It's pretty overtly religious that one's a little bit on that knows maybe

327
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:21,247
15 seconds into the

328
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:24,063
The rally

329
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,343
Where you at

330
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:27,391
We were worshiping the god of History

331
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,159
Alright

332
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:31,231
This rally

333
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:33,023
Itself this Jericho March

334
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:36,095
Was the product apparently

335
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:36,863
Two people

336
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,143
Who had a vision

337
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,935
And Eric metaxas is going to

338
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:40,959
Discuss that here

339
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,751
Another man

340
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:44,031
And the woman

341
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,615
Didn't know each other

342
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:51,455
Until a little while ago Robert Weaver and Arena grossu okay

343
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:53,247
Each of them in.

344
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,039
Hendon Lane case you didn't know the

345
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:55,807
The story

346
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:57,087
Each of them

347
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,623
Had an insane

348
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,183
From God

349
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:02,975
Rob Weaver

350
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:03,999
Told me this

351
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,791
Story a few nights ago

352
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,119
He says he didn't normally doesn't normally get Visions like

353
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,143
Yes in the Lord

354
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,935
Woke him up it's a dramatic

355
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:12,703
What story

356
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,239
And he had this insane

357
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,263
Open

358
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:16,543
Vision

359
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:17,567
Of peace

360
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:18,335
People

361
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,359
Gathered

362
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:24,223
Blowing shofar as there were nuns there when he described it to me exactly

363
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,759
The bad news is

364
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:29,343
It look nothing like this and you guys need to leave right now

365
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:30,879
I was kidding

366
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:31,903
That was a joke

367
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:35,743
A vision from God

368
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:38,047
You don't need to know anything else

369
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:39,839
You Just Praise Him

370
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,911
But he cares enough to show you what he is doing

371
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:48,799
Vision questions to will learn more about this Vision later

372
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:51,615
The thing that I think is interesting is like that is a terrible joke

373
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:54,431
I would have to go with yes that is

374
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:57,247
Is a terrible joke at the same time

375
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,015
He's doing

376
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,551
And I think actually

377
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:03,647
If I were the promoter or the booker of this is a

378
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:04,927
No he's doing great

379
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:13,119
It's not offensive but you can still tell it's an attempt at humor

380
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,167
Yep he's personable to the audio

381
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,959
That's the target of this rally

382
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:19,775
Trash

383
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:22,847
Memorabilia bad joke where you're like

384
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:26,175
Joke registered you know what I'm not going to hold it against you we're just going to move

385
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:28,479
It does feel like somebody who's there for a check

386
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:32,575
Forgot to clock in

387
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:33,599
Yeah I've done those

388
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:36,927
Before it's almost a cut and paste

389
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:37,951
Least kind of host

390
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:41,279
Joke you see a lot of that if you do enough stand up

391
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:44,351
Kind of get that vibe from him but at the same time

392
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:45,631
I kind of prefer that

393
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,399
2

394
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,423
Someone who's maybe taken

395
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:53,823
2 biggest swing a lot of money too

396
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:54,847
I see this guy trying to

397
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:56,383
Do crowd work at one of these rallies

398
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,175
Would be brutal

399
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:01,503
So we got these two people their division one is Rob Weaver

400
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:07,647
Evangelical Christian

401
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,695
So the two of them both had

402
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:14,303
We'll meet them a little bit later but

403
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,583
That's why this is happening

404
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,863
Alright so

405
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:23,007
This is happening because the evangelico Christians and the Catholics have finally both received the independent message

406
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:26,847
The drink that they were looking for

407
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:28,639
Put aside their previous

408
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:31,711
Doctrinal differences in order to take back

409
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,015
Presidency

410
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:37,855
Your whole f****** religion boils down to

411
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,647
Trump you pathetic s***

412
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:49,375
I have nothing against religion I have nothing against Christianity I have a real problem with the way in which

413
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,143
Their beat

414
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:52,447
Christianity and Trump are being melted

415
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:58,591
Yeah I mean we were talking about this religion I'm not going to s*** on Christianity as a as like

416
00:19:58,847 --> 00:19:59,359
Quote unquote

417
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,639
Concept or religion

418
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:01,407
As a whole

419
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,175
But

420
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,967
I will say that it is

421
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:07,039
Eminently reasonable to s*** on your religion if

422
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:07,807
If you think

423
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:10,879
That your ultimate battle of Good and Evil involved

424
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:11,647
Donald f******

425
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:13,183
That is tough

426
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,463
To to wrestle with

427
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:16,255
Yeah your religion is so

428
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:19,583
Weak and meaningless if that's

429
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:20,607
If that's what it is

430
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,911
Is it relies on Donald Trump

431
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,775
You hear things like this

432
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:28,543
And it's just

433
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:29,567
What

434
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:32,383
We are what God is doing in the United

435
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:34,687
Today by his grace

436
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:36,223
And today

437
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,503
We're going to see

438
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:38,783
Heaven move

439
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:41,087
Heaven is going to move

440
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,647
Thank you Jesus

441
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:45,439
Thank you Jesus

442
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:48,255
Before I introduce my friend

443
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:51,327
Mike Lindell who's going to tell you to use

444
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:53,119
The discount code

445
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:56,191
Eric

446
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:59,519
Before I introduce Mike Lindell

447
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:01,823
I'd like to Lead You In The Pledge

448
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:04,639
So what he's talking about

449
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:11,039
God is going to make an avid move and then immediately is going to introduce the my pillow guy and it gives up

450
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,575
Dog

451
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:13,599
Not give

452
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,623
Promo codes

453
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:21,024
Mike Lindell does I get that but if you're interested promo code

454
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,608
One of the problems that I find with both of these rallies is they are

455
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:27,680
Very clearly funded by my pillow

456
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:34,336
Fonts

457
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:40,736
Religious rally there's sponsored content I'm a bit worried that is

458
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,784
And that means what

459
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,064
He gets to

460
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:44,832
Speak

461
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:49,440
Well you get to walk on Roll by your way internet so my pillow guy

462
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:52,000
Jesus more than Buy in 5 minutes

463
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:55,584
Right before this event

464
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:58,400
You know there had been that Supreme Court

465
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:01,472
Thrown out the case Shore in Pennsylvania

466
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:03,520
Yeah they screamed it was to legally good

467
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:09,920
My pillow guy has some news about this but he received

468
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:11,968
Powell called him at 2 in the morning

469
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:19,648
Acordes the front

470
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:22,208
I got problems with the story

471
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:23,744
Alarm

472
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:27,072
Start off

473
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:28,096
Some home

474
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:31,424
What else night about 2 in the morning

475
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:41,408
And she filed

476
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:49,088
Michigan

477
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:50,624
Arizona

478
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:58,816
And everything that I've been telling you

479
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:02,656
100%

480
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:06,496
Donald Trump

481
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:13,408
Buy a pillow wow wow

482
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:14,944
Set Pennsylvania

483
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:20,064
Decide attempt to overturn the election mixed up

484
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,856
But yeah so he

485
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:25,952
I like the idea that Sidney Powell

486
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:32,352
Texted him and was like eight

487
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:36,192
Looks like a big setback but that was not our

488
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:41,824
Deal I'm not even a heart out of another dude I'm in the do-over

489
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:44,128
I'd like like that

490
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:46,176
And it's it does set the tone

491
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:49,504
Kind of for the event and that is everybody is joyous

492
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:54,624
Turns out that there was this big step backward Texas and

493
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:58,208
I like all these people it's signed on all these

494
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:00,000
Republican members of the House

495
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:01,536
Sidon

496
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:03,328
Bethesda then it didn't work

497
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:05,888
It seems like you know that was kind of

498
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:08,704
Almost like the Ron Paul winning the Iowa caucus

499
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,776
Of this cycle

500
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:13,312
There's that moment of Hope

501
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:16,384
Banana it's gone but no my pillow guy says Sidney Powell

502
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,408
Texted him at 2 in the morning

503
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,456
It's a tape be cool

504
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:24,576
I would buy this making sense if I knew that all of the rich

505
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:28,160
Republicans in and business owners and all that stuff we're all like

506
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,440
Buying a lot of

507
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:30,464
The property in a different

508
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,048
Country right now and all of them slowly moving all their stuff away

509
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:35,328
So I get all this like

510
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:40,960
Edging with the lawsuits is is them buying time to his to make good their escape before they pull the

511
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:41,984
The trigger and everybody

512
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:42,752
Explode

513
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,032
But otherwise

514
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,568
It just doesn't make any sense

515
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,896
What are you doing my pillow you're wasting a lot of money

516
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,736
They must be making a lot too though must be

517
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:56,064
They don't make any sense they're all magic

518
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,088
I don't know

519
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:59,392
Also when you consider I mean not

520
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:01,952
This guy

521
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:04,000
Do the my pillow guy is

522
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:04,768
Out there

523
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:05,792
Batman

524
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,584
Kind of

525
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,888
Person basically listen to talk for like

526
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:10,912
2 minutes and you like

527
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:13,472
Why you make Bad Business decisions

528
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:16,544
Here he discusses in a rambling way

529
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:19,104
His story of having a prosthetic dream

530
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:23,456
About how he was going to meet everyone

531
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:26,272
So he has a dream about how he's going to meet Trump

532
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:27,040
And then

533
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:28,064
Hemer

534
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,344
He does and

535
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,440
I am also I want to say really quick he talks a bunch about how he's a recovering

536
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:34,208
Crack addict

537
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:40,608
Cool I'm not beating up on that you're not making fun of that at all his just sort of background dressing to this story

538
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:45,984
I got up to 2,000

539
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:57,504
Why would I be

540
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,296
Some guy from Minnesota

541
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:00,320
Well

542
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:11,072
Carson was still running for president

543
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:13,888
12 p.m.

544
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:21,568
But that was

545
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,248
And I'm on a plane

546
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,784
To California

547
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:31,808
And

548
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:35,904
I'm sitting in the

549
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:38,208
It was about Donald Trump

550
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:41,792
Azusa August 5th

551
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:47,936
My favorite part of the story is when they struggle to remember the day

552
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,472
Whatever is going on in Ark

553
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:51,776
I need to know right now

554
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:04,576
I don't believe that story to believe a word of that b*******

555
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:07,136
Not for one second

556
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:07,904
Jesus

557
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,952
Bright

558
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:11,488
But

559
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:13,280
Itsfunneh Prado like it

560
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,120
I just did this story is is

561
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:17,888
Is

562
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,936
I just was listening to some like a man

563
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:20,960
Is this event

564
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:23,776
Ventura character

565
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,128
This is Minnesota stuff man

566
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:30,176
That's what I'm saying

567
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:32,224
Sound like Minnesota

568
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,040
Sound almost exactly

569
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:37,344
Vocal similarities

570
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,880
Yeah that matura

571
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:39,648
That's fair

572
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:40,672
That's fair

573
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:43,232
We need to move

574
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:44,256
The pressure now

575
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:45,024
Backcountry

576
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:49,120
You know what it used to be that when you were sitting on religion that was like

577
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:50,912
That was often

578
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:55,776
Discriminatory or being mean now we got to push the responsibility back on there

579
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:58,080
Religious people if you don't want to be made fun of

580
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:59,872
Don't listen to the my pillow guy

581
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:02,944
That's on you now the problem is he has so much money

582
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:09,344
That's still on you all religion jokes are fine they are non-discriminatory until the

583
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,880
Majority religious people are like

584
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:12,672
Let's not do my pillow guy

585
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:14,720
I don't agree I don't agree with that

586
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:15,488
Axiom

587
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:17,280
I don't believe I don't agree with that

588
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:20,352
The issue comes down to like

589
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:22,400
The religion is fine

590
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:25,216
But this isn't about religion this is about Watergate

591
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:26,496
Christian Nation

592
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:27,776
And my pillow guy

593
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:28,544
Pretty clear about that

594
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:32,384
This is been a spiritual battle in our country

595
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:48,000
He was God

596
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:54,144
In the name of Jesus.

597
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:55,936
Wow

598
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:58,752
I love you Mikey

599
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:01,568
You know what you want to know miracle of God

600
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:03,872
He went 62nd Shore

601
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:07,456
Hahaha a good joke War guys

602
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:09,504
Killing it

603
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,344
Mike is saying my pillow guy is saying is like

604
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,112
Okay yeah

605
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:19,744
That was just at 8 like a church Revival or something like that I don't think I'd have any issue with it like

606
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,768
There's an Awakening

607
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:22,048
Incoming Indianola

608
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,912
The problem is is a political rally

609
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:30,240
I know it sounds like a religious character but like

610
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:33,312
The reason you're having this rally is cuz Trump lost an election

611
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:37,920
Prophetic dream

612
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,480
Combination of the two that's just

613
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:41,760
Bucking

614
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,320
It's terrifying

615
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:47,904
I think probably one of the reasons that I would have a easier time

616
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:48,672
Like

617
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:50,720
Suggesting

618
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,512
This was

619
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:53,792
I suppose

620
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:57,120
John religious is just cuz I know.

621
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:57,888
Too much about

622
00:29:58,144 --> 00:30:00,448
How Christianity is supposed to work according to that

623
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:02,240
Buckley they say they like a lot

624
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:05,312
Read a little bit of it too much about it

625
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:06,848
And all of this stuff

626
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:09,664
Is like we're Christians and we want a Christian Nation I'm like

627
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,968
Have you motherfukers even opened

628
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:15,808
And also here's a promo code for my pillow

629
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:24,256
Makes me even more scared I think about it is that another's is combination of

630
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:26,048
Stop this Christian nationalism

631
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,096
And then it's also intersecting with

632
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:28,864
This

633
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,144
Deification

634
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,704
Admiration and

635
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,472
Just love

636
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:35,008
Of not only Trump

637
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:37,056
But also General Flynn

638
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:40,896
Yahoo is somebody who's a hero the qanon folks

639
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:44,736
Huey himself

640
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:47,040
Metaxas

641
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:47,808
Jesus

642
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:48,832
Flynn's appearance

643
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,880
In a little bit we have

644
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:52,160
General

645
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:52,928
Michael

646
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,232
Flynn is coming

647
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,840
Then you've heard of him

648
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:03,168
Oh I'm so impressed very good you guys

649
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,192
That's awesome

650
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:05,728
He is such a hero

651
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:08,032
He has been through such hell

652
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,312
Patriot

653
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:10,592
He believes

654
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:11,616
In The Lord of

655
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:12,640
The Bible

656
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:19,808
Alright a lot of people to send a picture of this Administration look Jesus

657
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:25,696
I don't know he's even saying I don't know what that supposed to mean at all or likewise

658
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:26,976
The hero and then attacks

659
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:27,744
Just told you

660
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,280
Because he believes in the god of the Bible

661
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:31,584
Really don't feel like that's enough but that's

662
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:35,168
I mean that's what they're saying another problem I have is that they are cheering

663
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:36,192
A thoroughly fictitious

664
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:36,960
Just people

665
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:42,592
Play the imaginary flim

666
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:43,872
Go to that character whatsoever

667
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:46,176
Bag

668
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:53,344
Before history they would if I were him I would lean into the fanfiction today more than

669
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,416
Your actual track record is f******

670
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:04,352
Metaxas brings out to Rob Weaver and Arena grossu the

671
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:06,912
Bellco in the Catholic Church

672
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:08,192
And

673
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:10,496
I would say the script

674
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:13,824
Tune of this Vision that he had his a little bit lackluster

675
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:17,152
This event will be going on for the next few hours left

676
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:18,176
Speakers more music

677
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:20,480
But I want to tell you about how it started

678
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:22,528
On November 5th I was really

679
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,552
Trouble

680
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:27,648
By the election and what I knew was wrong I think everybody in this country knows

681
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,672
The something

682
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:30,976
Is wrong in a man anyone

683
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:33,280
So

684
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:35,840
I just called out to God and

685
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:41,216
I literally felt something pushing in my side in the morning quite frankly I thought it was a remote but it wasn't

686
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:45,056
Somerton was pushing I Heard a Voice that said it's not over

687
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:47,104
So can I hear it's not over

688
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,176
Because it's not over

689
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,456
And when

690
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:53,504
And the next part of the vision I set down

691
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,040
And I literally

692
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:57,600
This

693
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:58,624
And I saw March

694
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:00,416
Going around the

695
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:01,184
The capital

696
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:04,000
I saw marches going around all six of the swing state

697
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:07,584
Better also going on today so hello if you guys can hear us there

698
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:11,168
So every one of them give him a shower

699
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,032
So

700
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:17,312
This is birth

701
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:18,080
From

702
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:19,616
A vision or a miracle

703
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:21,408
That's not much of a vision

704
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:22,432
Wow

705
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:25,504
So does that mean that

706
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:29,344
Cockroach poking M8 well does that mean that for like say the women's March

707
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:33,952
Was that inspired by God must have updated or did that did the devil send that

708
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:37,280
Devil probably

709
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:43,680
Giving dreams for Bradley's Devils clearly a better organizer

710
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:50,080
Larger huge to the point where these Margo folk will just post pictures of left

711
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,712
They should get in contact with the Devil

712
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:58,528
He is a good street team

713
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:04,160
Video Robin Arena or are just there in

714
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:05,696
You know they had their vision

715
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:07,232
Hooray good for them

716
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:10,304
Had a dream of people walking around DC with

717
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:14,400
Could never have been given to me from any other source other than God

718
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:18,496
Have a prayer

719
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:19,776
It is a lot of prey

720
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:21,824
People

721
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,128
I threw both of these rallies everybody wants to

722
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:26,176
To get up there and do the Lord's Prayer

723
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:28,992
Prayer you know like how in the book it said make

724
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:30,528
Make sure that you

725
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:31,552
Prelude

726
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:32,320
Ugly a

727
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:33,344
Formatively

728
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,648
For others and not for God

729
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:40,512
It reminds me of like early times

730
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:41,280
Wrestling

731
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:43,072
You didn't want in your first match

732
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:44,096
Someone to go through a table

733
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:49,984
Because then if you want to do that in that the headliner back in it.

734
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,776
Yeah I feel like everybody

735
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:52,544
Is not respect

736
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,336
That in terms of the Lord's Prayer

737
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:57,920
Like everyone's doing it

738
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:58,688
Can you

739
00:34:58,944 --> 00:34:59,456
I don't know it's just

740
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:02,528
It feels less savior Lord's Prayer for the end of

741
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,576
Right order

742
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:07,136
I mean he's cuter the headliner

743
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:08,928
To do or not do

744
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:09,952
I don't know

745
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:13,024
Anyway they pray and we get a prayer

746
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,072
That Steve pieczenik be very proud

747
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:17,376
The stage gets interrupt

748
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,168
Father I pray

749
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,192
Special blessing

750
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:21,216
I Melania Trump

751
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:22,240
One of the best

752
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:24,544
First ladies we've ever had in history

753
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,336
And I'm so tired of people

754
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:27,104
Coming against

755
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,384
Your father so go

756
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,408
Why

757
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:30,432
I pray and her children

758
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,016
And children in Jesus mighty name thank you Lord

759
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:37,344
Thank you guys

760
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:39,648
Actually

761
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:40,672
When when introduced

762
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,208
Only Alexander

763
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:44,512
So

764
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:49,632
What sort of walked out on stage

765
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:53,984
Walks out along with Ed Martin

766
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,544
I'll be Phyllis Schlafly Eagle for Upper Creek

767
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,640
Sandra apparently partnered with the the Jericho bar

768
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:03,712
That's kind of interesting

769
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:08,576
He starts talking about like you know hey we got we got a lot of fun things

770
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:10,368
Things coming up we got General Flynn

771
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:12,672
Trust is something that really struck my ears

772
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:14,720
Today is

773
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:16,000
We have General Flynn

774
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:20,352
On the road

775
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:25,984
Got a couple other characters in the spirit of unification

776
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,008
That's very strange

777
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,032
Also

778
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:29,312
The presidents in the sky

779
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:35,968
Promoting is at the Tropicana flyover Marine one grape

780
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:38,016
And I think he does show up like

781
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:39,296
Like during Flynn speech

782
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:40,320
Maybe

783
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:41,088
I don't know

784
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:46,720
There was a helicopter flying over at some point

785
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:51,584
Naughty imagery don't know if Trump was even in it

786
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,352
Why would you

787
00:36:54,912 --> 00:37:01,056
We'll just see the helicopter be like other presidents in there why would you actually go below president

788
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:02,592
Helicopter window

789
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,200
Of the Eagle Forum slightly eagle

790
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:11,552
CIA

791
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:12,320
Type

792
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:15,136
To give it up to the good media

793
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:30,752
Brothers Bar

794
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:31,776
Thank you for what you

795
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,872
Victory

796
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:39,456
America news I may go down the list and I just want to say

797
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:42,016
When we gathered at the

798
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:44,832
Turn on Entry

799
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:46,368
Time in Taiwan

800
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:49,696
Looking at America because on the hill

801
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:52,000
The light go out

802
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,352
Let's pray

803
00:37:56,608 --> 00:38:00,448
One day was conspicuous in its absence on that list

804
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:02,240
Actually considering

805
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:03,008
This dude saying

806
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:08,128
Right next to Allie Alexander

807
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:14,016
All these great media Outlets really do and everything for his I just

808
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:17,600
I can't get to a mall I'm going to name as many as I can

809
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:18,368
Epic

810
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:19,904
Is great one America news

811
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:24,256
Look I'm running out of time I can't express

812
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:28,096
They may not plug Infowars

813
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:29,376
But

814
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:30,912
They are willing

815
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:31,680
To let Alex

816
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:32,960
Give a little speed

817
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:37,056
Intuit this point the Mission Impossible theme place

818
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:37,824
Here Comes

819
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:41,920
In the spirit of unity

820
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:43,968
I'd like to bring out my new friend

821
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:45,760
Alex Jones

822
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:48,832
I think his name is Alex

823
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:53,952
Can't believe that many people

824
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:54,720
Chair for him

825
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:56,256
You know

826
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:05,984
See this make sense though

827
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:10,848
It does is a wrestling

828
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,640
You bring alexandersville

829
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:16,736
That's what you want and that's why people are tearing

830
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:18,528
Star

831
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:24,416
I want to hear Robin Arena grossu talk about their lackluster dream

832
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:30,816
People would be here for the my pillow guy telling a long story about his dream

833
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:32,352
I think it was December 20th

834
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:38,752
19 know who sings this was November 11th December 20th at 4:50 p.m.

835
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:41,312
Metaxas is a good

836
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:44,384
Or whatever to keep a thing moving along but he's not going to

837
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,408
To get you riled up

838
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,432
Alex

839
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:51,296
Jones's that's what he's going to do that's what he's there for

840
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:52,320
Bury your

841
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:58,464
The rally made the one that allowed Alex to speak at

842
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:00,768
So congratulations for that

843
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:03,328
But Alex does what Alex does and that is

844
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:04,096
More or less

845
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:04,864
That's just

846
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:07,168
Yell his ass off

847
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:09,216
Yeah but nonsense

848
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:11,520
Applause line

849
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:12,800
Applause line

850
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:28,160
Jesus Christ

851
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:34,560
Donald Trump

852
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:50,944
I thought Obama was the Antichrist

853
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:57,344
Alexandra

854
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:03,744
I like the idea of Jesus

855
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,792
Picture of The Giver

856
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:06,816
I'm the

857
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:07,840
I'm about peace

858
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:14,496
I was going to feed all these people okay well just get past that part

859
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:18,080
Let's just get to the Book of Revelation to realize there isn't a Revival.

860
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:22,176
Know your mind a little bit more

861
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:23,200
No one

862
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:27,296
Clap for that week s*** you know that the Antichrist convinces almost

863
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:30,624
All Christians to believe in him over

864
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:37,280
We got a blowout sale actually almost they would focus on like a single person instead

865
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:40,096
Dead of the Lord and really be like this

866
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:41,632
Person is the

867
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:45,216
True leader and we're going to give all of our allegiances to him

868
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:51,872
Without thinking about it and then because of that I'm like a you sound like a damn Global us you know what you're right

869
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:52,895
I'm going to have to go

870
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:54,687
Sauternes

871
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:00,063
World government

872
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,855
Microchip

873
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:07,487
Revelation

874
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:09,791
Jesus Christ

875
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:24,383
Have you looked

876
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:27,967
Mark Zuckerberg and the rest album

877
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:28,735
Nice

878
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:31,551
They are miserable

879
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:39,487
What does embarrassing

880
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:42,815
You get why people enjoy this

881
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:45,887
Incredibly dumb

882
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:48,959
Quality

883
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:52,543
You can also tell if you watch this video

884
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:54,079
Really takes a lot out of him

885
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:56,127
Like you can tell it like

886
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:57,151
He's

887
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:58,175
Cushing

888
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:01,759
To get all this Gala going voices exhaust

889
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:06,623
Yeah

890
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:07,903
Got to do it

891
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:09,439
We pray

892
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:10,463
For president

893
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:11,999
Arnold

894
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:14,815
Incredibly

895
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:26,079
What

896
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:36,319
World government

897
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:38,623
Is Publix

898
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:40,671
Collection

899
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:52,703
Does every act like you know how to how to frame a sentence

900
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:54,751
In a way that will end with like

901
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:57,823
Almost

902
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,383
Not not in like a necessarily badly but like

903
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:02,175
Comedian

904
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:04,479
You know structuring

905
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:09,087
Align do you know what you're saying is funny but the way you've written

906
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:10,879
It mattered way you're saying that

907
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:11,903
Is not funny

908
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:12,927
It doesn't leave

909
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:15,487
People to the reaction that you're looking for

910
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:17,791
Every single sentence

911
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:18,559
Betty saying

912
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:20,351
Is specifically meant

913
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:22,143
To make people yell at the end

914
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:23,423
That's

915
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:24,191
I mean

916
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:32,127
Don't do this in the middle of your vet I don't think it's a good idea like you're going to make everyone

917
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:33,151
What else look like trash

918
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:39,807
Just don't let him on your show at all how is it that I

919
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:42,367
I could run a bed

920
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:43,647
F****** rally

921
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:46,207
Just using the same principles of booking

922
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:51,839
Comedy show at you I bet you couldn't do cuz you have no idea who any of these people are

923
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:55,935
I wouldn't have them at my Rowlett

924
00:44:56,447 --> 00:45:00,031
Turbo what does persons like I wonder if I could do that that would be an interesting chat

925
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:06,175
Give me 10 seconds of each of these people say speaking and I'll see if I can't make a lineup out of them that would make more sense

926
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:09,247
Tell me a great idea

927
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:10,271
I might try but

928
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:13,087
Alright so anyway

929
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:16,927
What the big problem that I see with all of this

930
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:18,207
That's and I'm going to keep stressing

931
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:20,255
Use the insistence

932
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:21,535
On what you did

933
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:23,327
Describe is like Christian nationalism

934
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:27,679
Any idea that your God is the only real God and right

935
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:31,007
Just imagining being someone who is not

936
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:31,775
A

937
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:34,079
You know a Christian

938
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:36,639
This stripe in the audience

939
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,431
Think about how uncomfortable you.

940
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:52,255
On our side

941
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:57,887
Cuz it's not like it's the Jericho March and you know there is a religious

942
00:45:58,143 --> 00:46:01,983
Just character to it but it's not partnered with Ali Alexander and stop Bastille

943
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:05,055
And the Phyllis Schlafly Eagle Forum you know

944
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:06,335
Not just

945
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:07,359
It's just

946
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:12,991
I mean everything that they're saying though is screaming out a different form of we cannot color

947
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:16,575
We wouldn't exist

948
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:17,599
It's blunts or nothing

949
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:19,391
Yeah

950
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:20,927
There is a there is

951
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:22,975
And to be fair

952
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:26,559
So far the main speakers that we've heard are the my pillow guy in Dallas

953
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:28,351
So that's not

954
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:32,959
You know to be indicative of like everybody is unable to go

955
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:35,263
These voices that are being

956
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:36,031
Welcome

957
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:37,055
Computer

958
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:43,199
F*** yeah I mean but even then like the best you could say for so many of these people would be like

959
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:45,759
We can coexist so long as you stay under my boot

960
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:47,039
Then we'll be fine

961
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:51,903
So many people who have no idea about anything that has to do with

962
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:53,183
The religion of

963
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:54,463
Christianity think that

964
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:55,999
The crucifixion was a bad thing

965
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:59,583
You know like oh know if only we could have stopped

966
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:05,471
Really thinks that

967
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:07,519
Necessary

968
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:08,287
Before the

969
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:09,055
Atonement

970
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:10,847
It was almost

971
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:12,127
Preordained if you will

972
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:17,503
He's not he's not one of these guys would like

973
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:18,527
Tackled the Roman

974
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:20,575
Is a good guy

975
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:21,599
I don't know

976
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:50,015
Wow that's scary

977
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:51,295
A tariff

978
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:52,831
Is the deed to the planet

979
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:55,135
Yeah that's pretty much the most terrifying things

980
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:56,159
Somebody could scream at me

981
00:47:57,439 --> 00:48:02,047
Bob turn the sex club Alex gets into the First Amendment and stuff belly freedom of religion

982
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:03,839
But he's also

983
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:05,119
Gone too fast

984
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:06,655
He's he's

985
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:07,935
He's burned a lot of gas

986
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:09,471
Yeah he's out of

987
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:10,239
Yeah

988
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:12,031
Guess a little trouble

989
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:14,335
Toddler Show Magnolia

990
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:23,039
All Roald Dahl religion

991
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:28,415
Nola

992
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:32,511
Our forebears did not have separation

993
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:40,191
That's quite

994
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:43,007
Extension of the

995
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:45,311
State has no juries

996
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:47,103
Is diction over any of us

997
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:50,175
I'm pretty sure they were conclusion pretty sure they weren't like

998
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:56,575
Congress shall make no law respecting with respect to the free exercise of religion

999
00:48:57,087 --> 00:48:58,367
But what that actually means is

1000
00:48:58,623 --> 00:49:01,183
Christians are free of laws

1001
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:03,743
Yeah if you can just create

1002
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:07,071
Excuse religiously-based

1003
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:08,095
Staying in Paris

1004
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:08,863
Quotes

1005
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:11,167
The state can't do anything like

1006
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:13,983
Can kill for your religion

1007
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:19,103
I don't I don't know I feel like that's what he's saying of putting much yeah but also

1008
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:20,383
It's like

1009
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:21,663
These thoughts are not

1010
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:23,199
Washout

1011
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:23,967
Yellow

1012
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:25,247
There for people

1013
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:27,295
The Scream

1014
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:29,855
Here was Alex's lightning rod

1015
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:31,135
30 put out in order to

1016
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:34,207
I don't know who's going to White House

1017
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:44,959
Nice

1018
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:51,871
Where was the clip that got the big amount of attention on the internet because people fairly accurately interpret that is a Veiled Threat

1019
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:53,663
Towards Joe Biden

1020
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:57,503
I get that response but it's also exactly why Alex said what he said

1021
00:49:58,015 --> 00:49:59,551
It's almost certainly not legally ask

1022
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:00,575
Annabelle is a threat

1023
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:02,111
Nick the Secret Service and uptalk

1024
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:03,391
Talking to him about it that's even

1025
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:06,719
Super cool for him would love that

1026
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:10,047
Is it from the Secret Service so you know that what I said was power

1027
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:13,631
Honestly when I heard that I thought was pretty

1028
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:14,655
Tame for Alex

1029
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:18,495
Considering how up in arms people were like your articles

1030
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:19,263
Nobody like that

1031
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:20,031
I guess

1032
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:24,383
It takes on a slightly different character when he's yelling those things in front of a crowd who then

1033
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:28,735
Cheer but if you heard Alex say this and you think that's him crossing a line

1034
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:30,783
All that means is that you never listen

1035
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:35,391
I was going to say I saw his name in the news and I was like oh well

1036
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:36,927
Can't check on that but

1037
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:43,839
If that's what it was for Dan I I have surprise news for a lot of people

1038
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:44,607
Where is an attempt

1039
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:45,375
Contraption

1040
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:46,655
That is a trap

1041
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:51,519
You people fall into and I understand why they do and I honestly don't know

1042
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:53,823
If the best thing to do is ignore it

1043
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:55,871
But if you pay attention to it

1044
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:58,431
That gives him Free Press and that's why he

1045
00:50:58,687 --> 00:51:00,223
Implied

1046
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:00,991
Stage

1047
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:03,807
Theta biting would be removed one way or another

1048
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:04,831
I mean I guess with

1049
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:05,599
Alex

1050
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:07,391
The reality is

1051
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:08,671
He has nothing

1052
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:10,207
Tabac that thredup with

1053
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:10,975
At all

1054
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:13,791
And all he gets from it is attention for making

1055
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:15,327
And

1056
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:16,863
You know

1057
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:18,399
I understand why you'd be like

1058
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:20,959
The f*** is going on here

1059
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:23,519
At the same time it's like Alex is going

1060
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:30,175
Alex makes money you because he says stupid s*** like that and you go oh my God no and then we do it all into much

1061
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:33,247
Yeah I mean that's kind of a fever the show

1062
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:37,343
Slows down a little bit want to talk about

1063
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:38,879
My man g-dub

1064
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:40,159
George Washington

1065
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:43,487
President

1066
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:48,351
George Washington

1067
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:50,143
Who want to be king

1068
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:56,031
Quiet Man

1069
00:51:56,543 --> 00:51:58,079
Disbelief

1070
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:02,687
Control Battlefield

1071
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:16,511
So this rally is being held on the National Mall in Washington DC

1072
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:19,839
George Washington's Farm is now a national landmark called Mount Vernon

1073
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:23,423
16 Mi South End in the state of Virginia

1074
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:28,543
Washington's religious beliefs that's actually a matter that even scholars in the field of George

1075
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:31,615
Kimpton studies are fully settled on

1076
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:32,895
Springs up and he is correct

1077
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:35,455
Like Washington was really private about his beliefs

1078
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:38,527
The point is Alex could make that claim about wash

1079
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:42,879
God runs everything and all this in the seriousness of his beliefs

1080
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:44,671
But I would never back that up

1081
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:45,695
Naked never

1082
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:46,463
Prove that

1083
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:48,511
Yeah used to make that claim

1084
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:50,047
It's good

1085
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:51,327
Good for him because like

1086
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:53,375
So even if you were talk

1087
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:55,935
Talking to a Washington scholar they would be able to

1088
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:57,215
He's out more nuanced

1089
00:52:57,471 --> 00:53:00,031
Want to choose believe they wouldn't be able to be like you're lying

1090
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:00,799
Yeah

1091
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:02,079
I mean

1092
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:06,943
Looking at what they do with a guy who is alive and real and how they

1093
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:07,967
They created a false

1094
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:09,503
Story for him imagine

1095
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:12,063
We have no chance of them not trying to

1096
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:14,623
Claim the founding father said so I can whatever

1097
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:15,647
True

1098
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:17,439
So Alex

1099
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:19,487
Text talking about how he's God is the real God

1100
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:42,271
Keep your eyes on Christ it away from politics

1101
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:44,063
Like he said

1102
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:46,879
You remember how he said that

1103
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:52,255
Also get ready to overthrow the government

1104
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:54,815
Render unto Caesar what Caesars

1105
00:53:55,071 --> 00:54:00,703
Come up later you are making a joke about Jesus standing next to Alex on stage

1106
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:02,239
He's not there and he's not

1107
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:03,263
But somebody is

1108
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:07,871
Little bit down

1109
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:14,271
Little bit down Shroyer's standing there onstage and Alex hands the bike often

1110
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:17,343
This clip of Alex

1111
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:22,207
Saying oh you going to let Owen talk because it's okay

1112
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:24,767
About to do that

1113
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:41,407
It really sounds like that's

1114
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:46,783
Soap roster guard we are having our Easter sale in December

1115
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:48,575
So Alex

1116
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:50,111
Finishes up his stuff

1117
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:50,879
Koreans off

1118
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:52,415
Beaverton to Owen

1119
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:55,999
666 is the devil's number

1120
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:57,791
1776

1121
00:54:58,047 --> 00:54:59,839
Doesn't sound right

1122
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:23,391
That's that's Alex

1123
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:25,439
So important numbers

1124
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:28,511
To God yeah he's a real numbers guy

1125
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:34,399
1776 is God's number because the United States was ordained by God to stand up to Nazis I remember that

1126
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:35,679
There's a little complex

1127
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:42,079
City that I mean it's so what happened then whenever we grabbed all their scientists and didn't win then where

1128
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:44,127
Don't like hey could you guys quit being Nazi

1129
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:45,407
And we're just like I use

1130
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:49,247
Can you phrase that question in number form

1131
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:50,783
1940

1132
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:53,087
Owen

1133
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:56,159
He's not a great after that cuz how could you be

1134
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:57,183
I mean

1135
00:55:57,695 --> 00:55:58,207
Yelled

1136
00:55:58,463 --> 00:56:03,071
Applause line after Applause I usually worn out the audience

1137
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:03,839
Excitement

1138
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:04,863
Sewing

1139
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:06,399
This is so great

1140
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:07,423
God what

1141
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:08,447
A sad man

1142
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:11,263
What we have here today

1143
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:19,711
Chemistry ceviche

1144
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:25,087
So many problems with one man on local access

1145
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:27,647
You pretending that Alex Alex

1146
00:56:27,903 --> 00:56:28,927
Did read all of them

1147
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:35,327
Like you created this entire that they're only all there for him

1148
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:39,679
There are

1149
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:41,727
But I know it down

1150
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:43,775
Hellboy you got to do a little admin

1151
00:56:44,031 --> 00:56:46,335
At this point Eric metaxas comes out

1152
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:49,407
Danny's got a maybe you know reset the room a little bit

1153
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:55,807
It's like at the Dancehall the DJ can only play so many bangers in a row before you got to have

1154
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:59,135
One where everybody gets to sit down and maybe slow dance scene

1155
00:56:59,391 --> 00:57:03,743
I think people got too excited within their flags all around and it's a problem

1156
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:05,535
I got a little house

1157
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:06,303
Keeping

1158
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:08,095
They said to me

1159
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:09,375
Set these flags

1160
00:57:09,631 --> 00:57:11,167
In the front when there's when there's a

1161
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:12,447
Speaker they're blocking

1162
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:14,495
The video and this is being wise

1163
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:15,263
Live stream

1164
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:16,287
All over the place

1165
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:20,639
The speaker is speaking or the prayers praying

1166
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:23,711
That means taking them down you probably don't realize

1167
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:24,479
The term drop

1168
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:25,503
Down

1169
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:26,527
With the fly could you do that

1170
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:29,855
Korean flag

1171
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:33,439
What is a tongue Foo martial arts

1172
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:37,023
Because we want everybody's a lot of people who couldn't be here

1173
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:40,095
Need to get those flags down

1174
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:42,143
Nothing weird

1175
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:43,679
That's a weird little bit of

1176
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:44,959
Kostov

1177
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:48,031
I don't know what's going on

1178
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:50,847
I don't know what that he's referring to is

1179
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:57,247
And also there is a brown station wagon

1180
00:57:57,503 --> 00:58:00,319
Right now could somebody please it's a brown station wagon

1181
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:04,159
Play tee94 29

1182
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:08,767
So Eddie Gettys gets these flags down

1183
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:10,559
Right for the man the myth

1184
00:58:10,815 --> 00:58:12,607
Ali Alexander

1185
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:13,887
And give a little bit of a speech

1186
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:16,447
And he's he's basically out here saying hey man

1187
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:18,751
Now is the time

1188
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:20,543
That moral people

1189
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:21,823
Morrow p

1190
00:58:22,591 --> 00:58:26,175
Are deciding whether or not this presidency and this government itself

1191
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:29,247
I think that we are making his

1192
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:37,183
Is when moral Americans are deciding whether our government is legitimate

1193
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:38,207
Or illegitimate

1194
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:42,559
I think this is

1195
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:47,167
Tolerated

1196
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:50,751
That all of us are going to do

1197
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:52,031
Determine whether or not

1198
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:53,311
This is a legitimate government

1199
00:58:54,335 --> 00:58:56,383
Exciting thing will be whether or not Trump is

1200
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:57,151
Is installed again

1201
00:58:57,663 --> 00:58:58,175
And

1202
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:00,735
Ali is a little threatened

1203
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:03,295
There's an interesting thing

1204
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:04,063
That I notice

1205
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:06,367
Through these two rally

1206
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:10,207
The one with the women for Trump is large

1207
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:10,975
Julie

1208
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:11,999
Not

1209
00:59:12,255 --> 00:59:13,535
About destroying the GOP

1210
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:14,559
Okay sure

1211
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:17,375
Ali is threatening the GOP

1212
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:18,143
I like it

1213
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:23,263
I don't know if every speaker here is interested in destroying the Republican Party

1214
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:27,359
But Ali was one of the organizers of this is definitely

1215
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:29,407
Open to that discussion

1216
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:30,175
I think it's a great

1217
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:30,943
Just got in the house

1218
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:36,063
So not only will he destroy the GOP he will also shut down all of the city

1219
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:38,367
Good in this country

1220
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:40,671
Our truckers will shut down the city

1221
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:47,327
Patriots

1222
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:54,239
We can do all things through Christ who strengthens

1223
00:59:57,311 --> 01:00:00,383
Gmod Republican pirate my Republican colleagues

1224
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:01,151
Facts of it

1225
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:09,343
Really hung up almost black

1226
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:11,647
Can you walk

1227
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:13,183
To be led by such

1228
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:15,999
Wehner's like now a very soft very soft

1229
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:18,559
So I lie

1230
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:20,095
He's going to shut everything down

1231
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:21,631
And he's going to do this with

1232
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:22,399
The help of

1233
01:00:22,655 --> 01:00:23,935
Cool media out

1234
01:00:25,215 --> 01:00:27,263
You shut up

1235
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:28,287
Wow

1236
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:32,895
And one America news

1237
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:34,175
And news

1238
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:36,991
That was loud

1239
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:39,551
Epic

1240
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:42,623
End

1241
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:44,159
Never heard of it

1242
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:47,487
We don't need Fox News anymore Dewey

1243
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:58,495
You just had Alex Jones up basically work there

1244
01:00:58,751 --> 01:01:02,335
Alex's whole premise is like

1245
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:06,175
You have a Leo

1246
01:01:09,247 --> 01:01:11,039
That is something is very good

1247
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:13,087
Consisted

1248
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:15,647
Still on the outside even with viscum

1249
01:01:15,903 --> 01:01:16,927
Completely wacky

1250
01:01:17,183 --> 01:01:18,207
Media lamp

1251
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:21,791
So early is a really thrilled about this guy named Mo Brooks

1252
01:01:22,047 --> 01:01:25,375
Apparently has come out he's a member of Congress and the house

1253
01:01:25,631 --> 01:01:27,935
And he's said that

1254
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:29,727
Even if the Electoral College

1255
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:31,519
Comes back and says like a b

1256
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:32,287
President

1257
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:35,615
It's a man

1258
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:37,407
You took him to a lie of the

1259
01:01:37,663 --> 01:01:38,175
Cited

1260
01:01:45,087 --> 01:01:45,599
To the house

1261
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:46,367
Certification

1262
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:48,415
January 6th

1263
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:03,263
Good luck

1264
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:05,311
It doesn't stop there

1265
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:06,591
The threats

1266
01:02:06,847 --> 01:02:07,615
Republic

1267
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:09,663
Who don't support Mo Brooks

1268
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:12,479
Threatening

1269
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:16,319
Do not join

1270
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:19,135
We will burn the Republican Party Down

1271
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:21,183
And we will make something new

1272
01:02:21,439 --> 01:02:25,535
Oh no

1273
01:02:26,047 --> 01:02:27,583
I mean look I I would

1274
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:28,351
FoodSaver

1275
01:02:28,607 --> 01:02:31,423
That response is a little bit

1276
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:33,215
Not good

1277
01:02:33,471 --> 01:02:35,007
Yeah that we have and that is

1278
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:37,311
Because like well in 2009

1279
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:43,967
Some of the symbol of rhetoric was flying around it early tea party rally

1280
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:45,759
The Republican Party put you

1281
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:46,783
When

1282
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:48,063
That

1283
01:02:48,575 --> 01:02:49,087
Stafford

1284
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:49,855
Happens

1285
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:51,903
It's not like it cripples

1286
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:54,207
The park

1287
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:58,047
Extreme voices closer to the mainstream

1288
01:02:58,303 --> 01:03:00,607
Stream goes towards the crazy voices

1289
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:01,631
Is moroff

1290
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:03,679
End up where we are now

1291
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:06,751
So I don't think they're going to be capable of doing

1292
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:09,567
Encouraging the sort of

1293
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:12,383
Inner energy Opie fighting

1294
01:03:13,663 --> 01:03:15,199
I don't know if it's great

1295
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:20,063
Because it does also lead to deposit ability of people like

1296
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:23,647
Ally or Nick Fuentes or Alex Jones

1297
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:25,951
Coming into a more relevant

1298
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:27,231
Position than they would be other way

1299
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:29,023
I think I think you're right

1300
01:03:30,047 --> 01:03:31,327
Presupposing that

1301
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:32,351
We do nothing

1302
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:34,143
Which is what happens with

1303
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:34,911
The Tea Party

1304
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:35,679
We

1305
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:37,471
All set by in laughter

1306
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:39,263
Because they thought we were like hahaha

1307
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:40,287
Let Them Fight

1308
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:41,567
Instead of

1309
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:44,127
Using this is an opportunity for

1310
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:45,663
To sabotage both wings

1311
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:47,199
And f*** them up

1312
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:47,967
Together

1313
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:50,527
Like what we're doing Isabel

1314
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:52,831
Like it's like what they have done so

1315
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:54,111
Successfully is

1316
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:58,463
Constantly push a wedge between the left in the center in the Democratic Party

1317
01:03:58,719 --> 01:04:01,023
That's the best thing that the Republicans know how to do

1318
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:03,327
Is whenever there's the internecine squabbles

1319
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:04,607
From the Democrats

1320
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:11,007
The Republicans jump in and start throwing s*** at the wall tube to see if they can cause more conflict

1321
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:12,287
Inbetweeners

1322
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:14,847
And everytime this happens on the right the Democrats

1323
01:04:15,103 --> 01:04:19,199
Look back in the like well I bet the reasonable headshell Prevail this time

1324
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:21,503
I didn't say yeah

1325
01:04:21,759 --> 01:04:22,783
Yeah that that is

1326
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:23,551
That does seem

1327
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:26,879
To be I don't know it's tough because I do want to laugh also

1328
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:33,279
Yeah me too it's so funny Hood like to find a way to use this is a politically useful moment

1329
01:04:33,535 --> 01:04:34,047
Laugh

1330
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:36,351
Well I mean I think was it that I think

1331
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:39,423
Like I feel for these idiots kind of in a way

1332
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:42,751
But not the not the leaders at the rally

1333
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:45,311
Aunts and uncles and

1334
01:04:45,567 --> 01:04:47,615
Grandparents

1335
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:49,663
Sure I don't I don't feel for Ally

1336
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:50,943
No no absolutely

1337
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:52,735
No I mean the people in the rally

1338
01:04:52,991 --> 01:04:53,503
Because

1339
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:55,039
Paly

1340
01:04:55,295 --> 01:04:57,087
Rally fuel for the rally

1341
01:04:59,135 --> 01:05:00,927
No I mean the thing that I wanted

1342
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:03,231
Screaming all of these people is look

1343
01:05:03,743 --> 01:05:06,303
If you want what they are telling you you want to get

1344
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:09,375
Then you have to start a shooting War those are your options

1345
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:12,447
None of this s*** that they're selling you is real

1346
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:13,471
Their waist

1347
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:14,239
Senior time

1348
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:19,871
If you really want to balls up and start a shooting war or stop going to these dumbass rally

1349
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:21,919
People who are taking the rhetoric that

1350
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:25,247
You are digesting seriously are beating up people on the street

1351
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:26,015
Exactly

1352
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:29,343
That is the unfortunate reality of the rhetoric

1353
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:30,623
And what you are

1354
01:05:30,879 --> 01:05:32,927
Acclimating yourself to

1355
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:34,463
Yeah that would be

1356
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:36,511
Worthwhile for them to realize

1357
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:38,559
And the fruition of like

1358
01:05:38,815 --> 01:05:39,839
Specifically what

1359
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:41,887
This type of rally is about

1360
01:05:42,399 --> 01:05:43,423
You get your goals

1361
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:48,031
If you end up in a Christian theocracy

1362
01:05:48,287 --> 01:05:48,799
Anybody

1363
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:50,335
Chaotic most

1364
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:51,615
People really actually

1365
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:52,383
Want

1366
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:58,015
Know you know all those people who love Christianity in their super religious but then they

1367
01:05:58,271 --> 01:06:00,831
That getting to the situations where they have to apply it and I like

1368
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:02,367
Well maybe not this time

1369
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:09,023
You know what I'm still in Morley good person but this time I'm not going to act in this what you know Beck tonight I'm going to go out and get drunk

1370
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:15,423
Can I have a really good night your f****** killed for it

1371
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:16,447
Castor and

1372
01:06:16,703 --> 01:06:19,775
U-mary

1373
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:21,311
And then you end up back

1374
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:22,335
Banging around with

1375
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:23,615
The secretary

1376
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:24,639
Jeanette

1377
01:06:24,895 --> 01:06:30,271
You know I mean under you will not do as well as you do under a liberal

1378
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:31,551
Republic

1379
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:32,319
Puma difference

1380
01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:36,927
Yeah you know how rich Christian still seem to get all the abortions that they want to get

1381
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:38,463
It is weird that is weird

1382
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:39,231
So

1383
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:40,767
Ali Alexander

1384
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:43,071
He thinks he's a mastermind

1385
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:45,375
I got to say

1386
01:06:45,631 --> 01:06:46,143
Disconnect

1387
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:46,911
Clip

1388
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:47,679
Just sounds like

1389
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:48,959
Pictures of bondsville

1390
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:51,775
And he's coming out to this this rally in like

1391
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:53,055
Here is our G

1392
01:06:53,311 --> 01:06:55,103
Plan

1393
01:06:56,639 --> 01:06:57,407
It's already cringe

1394
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:00,223
January

1395
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:02,527
It's a start organizing

1396
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:05,087
We're going to go into the county parties

1397
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:07,391
We're going to go to the district parties

1398
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:08,415
And we're going to go to

1399
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:11,743
And we're taking over

1400
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:12,511
Estates

1401
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:16,351
We are going to work

1402
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:18,399
Alex Jones

1403
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:21,471
Anyone

1404
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:29,151
And finally the movie

1405
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:35,551
A state party chairman

1406
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:36,319
We've known each other

1407
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:38,623
For 12 years you're up for reelection in May

1408
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:39,903
I'm going to flood

1409
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:40,671
State Convention

1410
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:42,719
And then after we take over all

1411
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:43,487
Positions

1412
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:47,327
Call Korman they were going to impeach the rest of the officers aren't we

1413
01:07:54,495 --> 01:07:55,007
Wow

1414
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:58,079
Prairie

1415
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:05,759
We're going to replace you with

1416
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:08,575
That's called voting

1417
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:09,599
I think he's

1418
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:10,367
Musically

1419
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:12,927
Did you just discover voting I think he discovered

1420
01:08:13,183 --> 01:08:18,047
Community organizing I think so they have decried the left do I hate it

1421
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:19,071
So much cuz it

1422
01:08:20,351 --> 01:08:21,631
Creasing on local politics

1423
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:26,751
Yeah scary

1424
01:08:27,007 --> 01:08:28,799
See this is why it's hard to take Alex

1425
01:08:29,055 --> 01:08:30,335
The threat seriously like

1426
01:08:30,591 --> 01:08:33,663
We're going to tell Joe Budden immediately

1427
01:08:33,919 --> 01:08:40,063
What we're going to do is we're going to go stand, Orem

1428
01:08:42,111 --> 01:08:44,415
Robert's Rules of Order

1429
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:46,207
God dammit

1430
01:08:46,463 --> 01:08:46,975
I bet he does

1431
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:51,071
I'm going to I'm going to follow patent into battle if you give the speech like

1432
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:52,095
Abreva

1433
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:56,959
Robert's Rules of Order are dangerous in the wrong hands

1434
01:08:57,215 --> 01:09:02,591
I was actually on my mind quite a bit throughout that I think it's probably because General Flynn I watched him give the same speech

1435
01:09:06,687 --> 01:09:08,223
Not Pat this is

1436
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:12,831
Bad to keep hearing this when you hear nationalist propaganda you wanted to be pet

1437
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:15,647
Right well I mean that's what Alex is trying to be

1438
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:17,183
And a lot of people are just

1439
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:18,975
Absolutely with it

1440
01:09:19,231 --> 01:09:19,743
Not good

1441
01:09:19,999 --> 01:09:21,279
They're still

1442
01:09:21,535 --> 01:09:22,303
Scary but

1443
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:24,351
Ali

1444
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:29,983
And his speech by

1445
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:31,519
This is upsetting

1446
01:09:40,735 --> 01:09:41,503
I'm coming out

1447
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:48,415
I have been different state

1448
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:52,511
The fuc

1449
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:56,607
Ouch ouch

1450
01:09:57,119 --> 01:09:57,887
No

1451
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:04,031
I've been damn it you ever been to 10 states and it didn't rain once

1452
01:10:04,543 --> 01:10:05,311
Can you say that

1453
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:06,591
I guess I can't

1454
01:10:06,847 --> 01:10:08,639
Or maybe I can I don't know

1455
01:10:08,895 --> 01:10:15,039
Just flying count what if I flew over 10 states and it didn't rain once does that count we're above the blood count

1456
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:17,343
God dammit

1457
01:10:19,135 --> 01:10:22,207
This is how I feel everybody's everytime somebody tells me about ghosts

1458
01:10:22,463 --> 01:10:23,999
Everybody every time somebody's like

1459
01:10:24,255 --> 01:10:25,279
Oh you don't believe in ghosts

1460
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:26,815
I've got to go so I'm like

1461
01:10:27,071 --> 01:10:29,887
Tell me about how the sunshine for tents

1462
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:31,935
F*** you

1463
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:33,727
It's a ghost

1464
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:35,007
Stingray

1465
01:10:35,263 --> 01:10:38,079
Did Chicago surreal chirp

1466
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:39,103
Alright

1467
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:40,383
Alright reverse

1468
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:42,943
Douglas Adams rain God get the f*** out of here

1469
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:45,759
So after Ellie gets done

1470
01:10:46,015 --> 01:10:50,623
They have another speaker and this is a guy by the name of Leon Benjamin

1471
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:51,903
Okay who is a bishop

1472
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:55,231
But I should also tell you that this is your

1473
01:10:55,743 --> 01:11:01,887
The church also lost the race for the 4th District of Virginia seat in the house

1474
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:02,655
Representative

1475
01:11:02,911 --> 01:11:05,471
That's a bummer he also probably would have lost

1476
01:11:05,983 --> 01:11:10,335
Primary like all the ding dongs that we talked about on the show but he ran unopposed

1477
01:11:10,847 --> 01:11:11,871
Until the general election

1478
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:16,735

261

1481
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:21,855
Not as big a margin as I would hope

1482
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:22,879
No

1483
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:26,975
Never is a bidet

1484
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:32,863
Eric metaxas brings Bishop

1485
01:11:33,887 --> 01:11:35,679
I got to say

1486
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:38,751
I thought like maybe this was a racist event

1487
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:40,799
Cleared it up

1488
01:11:41,311 --> 01:11:42,079
I heard

1489
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:44,127
I keep hearing

1490
01:11:46,943 --> 01:11:47,967
And yet every now and again

1491
01:11:48,223 --> 01:11:49,247
I bump into

1492
01:11:49,503 --> 01:11:51,807
A black man at these events what is happening

1493
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:53,599
What is the what is happening

1494
01:11:54,111 --> 01:11:57,439
Every now and again is he talking about

1495
01:11:57,695 --> 01:11:59,231
Are we supposed to be all about weight

1496
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:01,279
Nationalism I keep reading that

1497
01:12:01,535 --> 01:12:02,815
And you're screwing that up

1498
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:03,583
This is

1499
01:12:03,839 --> 01:12:04,351

Leon Benjamin

1501
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:08,191
He's got a shofar

1502
01:12:08,447 --> 01:12:12,543
At the end he says he's going to play the Flight of the Bumblebee

1503
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:13,823
Don't miss it

1504
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:14,847
Another bad joke

1505
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:17,407
Wow yeah they're not racist at school

1506
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:23,807
He wasn't being racist and might be on the end might be on the cusp

1507
01:12:24,063 --> 01:12:25,087
I'm not entirely sure

1508
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:26,623

I know that we are we've heard a lot about we at you

1526
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:24,223
Over the course of the time of doing

1527
01:13:26,271 --> 01:13:27,551
Not really

1528
01:13:29,343 --> 01:13:31,391
Advice about what to do about or more like

1529
01:13:42,143 --> 01:13:43,679
I'm coming out to you

1530
01:13:43,935 --> 01:13:45,215
Last day

1531
01:13:54,175 --> 01:13:55,967
You have to be direct with witches

1532
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:56,735
You understand

1533
01:13:56,991 --> 01:13:58,527
That's the advice

1534
01:13:58,783 --> 01:13:59,807
I just I'm just

1535
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:03,647
I'm thinking is

1536
01:14:03,903 --> 01:14:04,927
Wizard of Oz

1537
01:14:05,183 --> 01:14:06,207
Dorothy wakes up

1538
01:14:06,463 --> 01:14:08,511
Glinda the Good Witch shows up and she's just like

1539
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:15,167
You listen to me

1540
01:14:19,263 --> 01:14:20,031
Deleon

1541
01:14:20,799 --> 01:14:22,079
Scares the hell out of me

1542
01:14:22,335 --> 01:14:23,615
Franklin

1543
01:14:23,871 --> 01:14:24,639
Because he says stuff like that

1544
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:26,943
But when you show

1545
01:14:32,063 --> 01:14:34,623
Next Generation

1546
01:14:35,647 --> 01:14:37,695
Because

1547
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:40,767
All children

1548
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:44,607
We will kill them now

1549
01:14:44,863 --> 01:14:47,167
We will not fight

1550
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:56,383
Man I understand that there's some like rhetorical license that you're not maybe intending to talk

1551
01:14:56,639 --> 01:14:58,431
Talk about killing humans in your

1552
01:14:58,687 --> 01:14:59,711
Political enemies

1553
01:15:00,223 --> 01:15:02,015
But you're at a political rally

1554
01:15:02,527 --> 01:15:05,599
And you're talkin about these demons in these Devils that were

1555
01:15:05,855 --> 01:15:06,367
Up against

1556
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:09,183
And the conversation very easily it could be under

1557
01:15:09,439 --> 01:15:09,951
Understood

1558
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:13,535
People who wear black and like you think they're in antifa

1559
01:15:13,791 --> 01:15:15,839
Maybe someone at a black lives matter rally

1560
01:15:16,351 --> 01:15:22,495
Maybe these are the demons that you don't want your children to every life of his one-year children doesn't have to fight

1561
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:24,031
I don't I don't think that

1562
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:27,103
You know you could make a legally reasonable case

1563
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:27,871
Did this is

1564
01:15:28,383 --> 01:15:28,895
Somebody

1565
01:15:29,407 --> 01:15:32,991
Threatening inciting people to kill other people chew or

1566
01:15:33,247 --> 01:15:33,759
Reckless

1567
01:15:34,015 --> 01:15:35,807
It's recklessly

1568
01:15:36,063 --> 01:15:37,599
Expressed ideas and II

1569
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:38,879
That's a great

1570
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:41,951
Speech if it's 1977 and you're talking about

1571
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:42,719
Climate change

1572
01:15:45,023 --> 01:15:46,047
Every bit of

1573
01:15:47,071 --> 01:15:48,863
Greenhouse gas that we get rid of

1574
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:53,983
That I don't have to deal with it that way

1575
01:15:54,495 --> 01:15:55,519
It's a good thing to do in fact

1576
01:15:56,031 --> 01:15:56,799
Somewhat

1577
01:15:57,055 --> 01:15:58,335
Jones

1578
01:15:58,591 --> 01:15:59,615
Gave his speech

1579
01:16:00,127 --> 01:16:02,175
And then a little video came out

1580
01:16:02,431 --> 01:16:02,943
Of

1581
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:03,711
Him

1582
01:16:04,223 --> 01:16:04,991
Backstage

1583
01:16:05,247 --> 01:16:05,759
Oh yeah

1584
01:16:06,015 --> 01:16:06,783
She ran into

1585
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:07,807
General Flynn

1586
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:09,855
And this is really really funny

1587
01:16:10,111 --> 01:16:15,743
Had some word I recommend people go find this video since we're in audio podcast with play the audio and then I'll explain what happened

1588
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:35,967
General Flynn did not want to talk to Alex

1589
01:16:36,223 --> 01:16:42,367
Comes up and he's like crazy day at General Flynn does not turn to him

1590
01:16:42,623 --> 01:16:43,391
My cat is crazy day

1591
01:16:43,903 --> 01:16:44,671
Hey there. We're going to win

1592
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:46,463

1593
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:47,487
Are you scared

1594
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:52,607
Yeah

1595
01:16:52,863 --> 01:16:54,399
Alex title gets loose like

1596
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:55,679
Like someone else

1597
01:16:55,935 --> 01:16:57,471
Kind of walks up and Alex

1598
01:16:57,727 --> 01:17:03,871
Just get the sense like I got to leave over at Owen Shroyer

1599
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:06,431
Back

1600
01:17:06,943 --> 01:17:13,087
So there's a rubeola going through these just in the corner watching

1601
01:17:13,343 --> 01:17:16,159
Knows like I was going to go out

1602
01:17:16,415 --> 01:17:19,487
Be there that Alex

1603
01:17:19,743 --> 01:17:21,535
Funny

1604
01:17:22,047 --> 01:17:25,119
Play M knows who you are and doesn't want to be associated

1605
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:27,167
Interview or has no idea who you are

1606
01:17:27,423 --> 01:17:29,983
Either way does not work well for his brand

1607
01:17:30,751 --> 01:17:31,519
You should not meet

1608
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:33,567
Your Heroes that you created

1609
01:17:33,823 --> 01:17:37,407
Fictional versions of the fictional version will greet you warmly

1610
01:17:38,431 --> 01:17:38,943
It's such an issue

1611
01:17:40,991 --> 01:17:42,527
He gives up but he gives a speech

1612
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:45,855

Getting to the speech

1615
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:48,927
It's just

1616
01:17:49,183 --> 01:17:49,951
Awe-inspiring

1617
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:54,047
You know I was going to end with a prayer but maybe we'll start with a

1618
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:54,815
The prayer

1619
01:17:57,119 --> 01:18:02,495
This sounds play I told I told Mike Lindell as he was walking and we bumped into each other

1620
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:04,031

1645
01:19:05,215 --> 01:19:06,495
Correct correct

You tell me a little bit about the fear is the mind-killer it is the little-death that

1647
01:19:13,151 --> 01:19:19,295
It's part of the litany against fear.

1648
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:25,695
Something that the Bennett Jesuit teach you to say whenever you're free

1649
01:19:25,951 --> 01:19:31,071
You said many a time it would have called himself and bring himself into a text with relate to

1650
01:19:31,327 --> 01:19:37,471
Idaho Idaho learn the litany against fear his mother was about a Jesuit okay

1651
01:19:37,727 --> 01:19:43,871
And so he was aware of all of that stuff however he was never trained in the ways of the Benadryl because men children wear

1652
01:19:44,127 --> 01:19:44,895
Not allowed only

Body pillow

1660
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:03,327
Sandworms kill everybody but they are also God

01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:08,703
Discuss this a little bit

1665
01:20:08,959 --> 01:20:09,471
Because

1666
01:20:09,727 --> 01:20:12,031
Ask Mike Flynn was talkin early

1667
01:20:12,799 --> 01:20:15,616
Are you going to get into if he's talking about fear

1668
01:20:15,872 --> 01:20:21,760
Who is the fear is the mind-killer he's very close in our minds

1669
01:20:22,016 --> 01:20:22,784
In our minds

1670
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:24,064
That's where we

1671
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:25,088
Define fear

1672
01:20:26,368 --> 01:20:28,160
Because fear is a is a mint

1673
01:20:28,416 --> 01:20:30,208
Nothing is something that you have in your

1674
01:20:30,464 --> 01:20:31,744
And your minds and you fear thing

1675
01:20:32,512 --> 01:20:33,536
Because you're mine says I'm a

1676
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:35,328
I'm afraid of that I'm afraid of this

1677
01:20:36,096 --> 01:20:37,120
But it's in our hearts

1678
01:20:38,144 --> 01:20:38,912
It's in our hearts where we

1679
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:39,936
We truly know

1680
01:20:40,704 --> 01:20:41,216
What is right

1681
01:20:42,752 --> 01:20:44,032
Because you're not Hearts that's where we

1682
01:20:44,544 --> 01:20:45,056
Differentiate

1683
01:20:45,312 --> 01:20:46,592
Between good and bad

1684
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:49,664
Prairie differential

1685
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:51,456
Between Darkness and Light

1686
01:20:52,992 --> 01:20:54,784
Let me know that we know that in our heart we

1687
01:20:55,808 --> 01:20:57,600
Gut feeling but it's actually your heart

1688
01:20:58,368 --> 01:20:59,136
Hit your heart talkin

1689
01:20:59,904 --> 01:21:02,208
Not your mind because your minds going to say

1690
01:21:02,976 --> 01:21:03,744
I'm afraid

1691
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,304
So fear is the mind-killer

1692
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:10,400
Because you're it like weird feelings are actually your heart which is clearer because your heart

1693
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:13,216
Free of fear the only thing we have

1694
01:21:14,496 --> 01:21:15,008
Is

1695
01:21:15,264 --> 01:21:21,408
Because it comes from inside you but it's also part of your heart and you can't judge

1696
01:21:21,664 --> 01:21:24,224
Because it's what you're afraid of and it's in your head

1697
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:27,296
And we're is what we fear the most itself

1698
01:21:27,808 --> 01:21:28,320
Yeah

1699
01:21:28,832 --> 01:21:29,344
Patent

1700
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:31,648
No

1701
01:21:31,904 --> 01:21:32,672
Not a great speaker

1702
01:21:32,928 --> 01:21:33,440
Sears in history

1703
01:21:35,232 --> 01:21:35,744
Not one of them

1704
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:36,768
No

1705
01:21:37,024 --> 01:21:40,096
Realize as he was speaking that I don't think I've ever

1706
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:43,936
Yutaka full speech of his me neither and I found it

1707
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:44,704
Underwhelm

1708
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:46,752
I've found that to be incredibly tariff

1709
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:49,056
It's the one thing I'm afraid of is

1710
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:52,896
Is helicopters a good segue

1711
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:54,944
Well I'm afraid of a Segway

1712
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:56,736
Well we're both terrified we go

1713
01:21:57,248 --> 01:22:00,320
Well twin is onstage that's when the flyover happened huh

1714
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:09,536
Imagine being able to just jump in the helicopter go for a joyride around Washington d.c. I love it I love the fact that

1715
01:22:09,792 --> 01:22:10,304
Does that

1716
01:22:11,072 --> 01:22:12,096
That's what he does because

1717
01:22:12,864 --> 01:22:13,632
He knows

1718
01:22:13,888 --> 01:22:14,912
He knows that

1719
01:22:15,168 --> 01:22:15,680
The people that

1720
01:22:15,936 --> 01:22:16,960
He can trust

1721
01:22:17,472 --> 01:22:19,008
Are people that he's never met

1722
01:22:20,288 --> 01:22:22,592
Contact you I mean he's never mad at you

1723
01:22:22,848 --> 01:22:24,128
Look at the millions and millions of people

1724
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:25,152
Bright

1725
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:28,992
He trusts you he trusts you because he knows

1726
01:22:29,504 --> 01:22:31,296
You know what's going on

1727
01:22:31,552 --> 01:22:35,136
And you will not allow what's happening to happen in our country none of us will

1728
01:22:35,392 --> 01:22:38,208
It's just not going to happen. I will tell you one more time

1729
01:22:38,464 --> 01:22:40,512
Good I've been half on a scale of 1 to 10

1730
01:22:40,768 --> 01:22:43,584
Who will be the next president of the United States when I say Donald Trump

1731
01:22:44,352 --> 01:22:45,120
10A 10

1732
01:22:47,424 --> 01:22:51,520
You know that that moment they were he's like first of all the idea that Trump

1733
01:22:51,776 --> 01:22:54,336
Can trust you people who he doesn't know it's very sad

1734
01:22:54,592 --> 01:22:55,104
So sad

1735
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:57,152
Play music

1736
01:22:57,408 --> 01:23:01,504
Trust you because you're the ones who know what's going on you're not going to let what happened and how it happened

1737
01:23:02,016 --> 01:23:04,320
Makes me think of that Andy Daly character is like

1738
01:23:05,344 --> 01:23:11,488
Stand-up comic who says nothing like what else is in the news today

1739
01:23:11,744 --> 01:23:17,120
I mean come on

1740
01:23:17,376 --> 01:23:17,888
When I was

1741
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:23,776
Not if I ever

1742
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:28,640
Because you know what's going on in your acolyte what happens happens

1743
01:23:29,408 --> 01:23:30,688
Wow so I could say

1744
01:23:30,944 --> 01:23:31,712
Say that you wanted

1745
01:23:32,224 --> 01:23:34,016
Everyone to insights

1746
01:23:34,272 --> 01:23:34,784
Installing

1747
01:23:35,296 --> 01:23:35,808
The unelected

1748
01:23:36,064 --> 01:23:36,832
President

1749
01:23:37,088 --> 01:23:38,880
Hunter's so much of that

1750
01:23:39,136 --> 01:23:39,648
Like

1751
01:23:40,416 --> 01:23:43,232
It is it is one of those things that you don't really

1752
01:23:43,488 --> 01:23:44,512
It it doesn't always

1753
01:23:44,768 --> 01:23:45,536
Hit you until it does

1754
01:23:46,048 --> 01:23:46,560
How much Uber

You just here

1757
01:23:52,448 --> 01:23:53,216
General

1758
01:23:54,496 --> 01:23:57,824
And you'd like see his military record and all of these

1759
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:00,128
War

1760
01:24:01,152 --> 01:24:02,176
High-ranking you're like

1761
01:24:02,688 --> 01:24:05,760
That's the f****** guy and you're going to think of No Noggin

1762
01:24:06,016 --> 01:24:06,528
Nonsense

1763
01:24:08,832 --> 01:24:11,648
The man of few words

1764
01:24:11,904 --> 01:24:18,048
Kind of yeah and that's not the way I planned gets actually

1765
01:24:18,304 --> 01:24:22,144
Political and politics his way up into the military a high-ranked he's a f******

1766
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:24,448
There's another guy

1767
01:24:24,704 --> 01:24:25,728
That's for Trump who gives a speech

1768
01:24:25,984 --> 01:24:26,496
Beach that is

1769
01:24:26,752 --> 01:24:30,080
Uneventful

1770
01:24:30,336 --> 01:24:31,104
What you're talkin about

1771
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:32,640
What you would expect later

1772
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:33,664
Oh you're

1773
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:36,224
You're terrifying

1774
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:41,344
Your dark dark Mexican archetype

1775
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:44,928
I got to say

1776
01:24:45,184 --> 01:24:46,464
The Jericho rally drag

1777
01:24:46,976 --> 01:24:47,488
At this point

1778
01:24:47,744 --> 01:24:52,352
I believe it I'm done with it we're not going to talk about any more of it cuz it just ends up

1779
01:24:52,608 --> 01:24:53,888
Deteriorating into thing we're like

1780
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:55,424
There's a guy from bikers for

1781
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:57,472
Trump news end up talking about how they

1782
01:24:57,984 --> 01:24:58,496
60 formed

1783
01:24:58,752 --> 01:25:00,288
This group right before

1784
01:25:00,544 --> 01:25:01,056
Because they wanted to

1785
01:25:01,312 --> 01:25:02,848
Just stop antifa from throwing dog

1786
01:25:03,104 --> 01:25:04,128
Stupid Trump supporters

1787
01:25:04,384 --> 01:25:05,664
We're waiting in line to get into a

1788
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:07,200
You said that in front of

1789
01:25:07,456 --> 01:25:13,600
People you said that in an interview on the TV wow there's also some more religious weirdos and

1790
01:25:13,856 --> 01:25:14,880
You know

1791
01:25:15,904 --> 01:25:16,928
I just I lost it

1792
01:25:17,184 --> 01:25:18,208
I couldn't

1793
01:25:18,464 --> 01:25:20,256
There's also a couple other Infowars character

1794
01:25:20,512 --> 01:25:21,792
I kind of really a Jason

1795
01:25:22,048 --> 01:25:23,584
Some people like Jason Jones

1796
01:25:24,608 --> 01:25:29,216
The 4th hour sometimes I think he was there and he gave an interview

1797
01:25:29,472 --> 01:25:30,240
Was just kind of like

1798
01:25:31,008 --> 01:25:32,032
This is too much

1799
01:25:32,288 --> 01:25:33,568
And again I think a problem

1800
01:25:33,824 --> 01:25:34,592
Is it Alex

1801
01:25:34,848 --> 01:25:35,616
What kind of early

1802
01:25:36,128 --> 01:25:41,504
Yeah it really took so much gas come out of none of these other people could reach the heights of that

1803
01:25:42,528 --> 01:25:46,880
You know like I don't I don't know of any actual comedian who talks about last per minute

1804
01:25:47,136 --> 01:25:48,672
Yeah but it would be idea.

1805
01:25:49,184 --> 01:25:50,208
An Applause line

1806
01:25:50,464 --> 01:25:51,232
A minute Alex

1807
01:25:51,488 --> 01:25:52,256
Just wrecked

1808
01:25:52,512 --> 01:25:54,304
Shop no one is going to be able

1809
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:55,584
Go to recover

1810
01:25:56,096 --> 01:25:56,864
Discord servers

1811
01:25:59,424 --> 01:26:01,472
Which I imagine he did on purpose

1812
01:26:01,728 --> 01:26:02,496
It's honestly

1813
01:26:02,752 --> 01:26:03,264
Because I

1814
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:05,568
I've been I've been under Robin put

1815
01:26:05,824 --> 01:26:07,872
Where I wasn't supposed to go in the lineup before

1816
01:26:08,128 --> 01:26:09,408
Yeah and I made it very clear

1817
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:11,200
I wasn't supposed to go

1818
01:26:11,712 --> 01:26:12,736
Yeah yeah

1819
01:26:12,992 --> 01:26:14,784
I'm going to bury whoever comes up next

1820
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:20,672
Barrier Headliners so far into the ground

1821
01:26:20,928 --> 01:26:27,072
And Mike Flynn both come out to the Mission Impossible theme stolen my 25th

1822
01:26:27,328 --> 01:26:28,096
Girls music

1823
01:26:28,352 --> 01:26:28,864
No that's

1824
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:35,264
That's a t-shirt that I am here for it all day might be something there

1825
01:26:36,288 --> 01:26:36,800
So

1826
01:26:37,312 --> 01:26:37,824
I

1827
01:26:38,336 --> 01:26:38,848
Watch

1828
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:40,640
How much more of this

1829
01:26:40,896 --> 01:26:42,176
But I lost my page

1830
01:26:42,432 --> 01:26:43,200
For it because

1831
01:26:43,456 --> 01:26:45,248
I mean like how much what what else are we going to fight

1832
01:26:45,504 --> 01:26:49,088
More examples of people saying the exact same Christian nationalist cheap

1833
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:50,624
Who cares God

1834
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:53,184
Kill everybody we got it moving on but

1835
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:54,464
There was another rally

1836
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:55,232
That day

1837
01:26:55,744 --> 01:26:58,560
This was the women of her America First rally

1838
01:26:59,328 --> 01:27:02,144
This was being held to pretty close nearby around the same time

1839
01:27:02,656 --> 01:27:08,288
There's some particularly fun footage also that's going around on Twitter which is of Alex trying to bum rush

1840
01:27:08,544 --> 01:27:09,056
The stage

1841
01:27:09,312 --> 01:27:15,456
At the women for Trump rally sounds like a metaphor I'm able to understand.

1842
01:27:15,712 --> 01:27:16,224
Shuffle

1843
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:18,176
Goodman family show Alex

1844
01:28:18,432 --> 01:28:21,504
My first thought when I watch that was

1845
01:28:22,528 --> 01:28:23,296
It seems like he's on

1846
01:28:23,552 --> 01:28:26,112
Stimulants

1847
01:28:26,368 --> 01:28:26,880
Red eyes

1848
01:28:27,136 --> 01:28:30,464
Yeah and like grinding his mouth in like ready to

1849
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:31,232
The flight with a

1850
01:28:31,488 --> 01:28:32,512
Security guard who won't let him

1851
01:28:32,768 --> 01:28:33,280
Through

1852
01:28:33,536 --> 01:28:34,304
Feels like you

1853
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:36,096
He's clearly thinks he's entitled

1854
01:28:36,352 --> 01:28:40,448
How to get up there and get on stage

1855
01:28:40,704 --> 01:28:41,216
From here

1856
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:42,752
But I

1857
01:28:43,008 --> 01:28:44,288
Think about it I like well

1858
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:46,080
Honestly he probably

1859
01:28:46,336 --> 01:28:50,176
He's coming over there right after he yelled at the other crowd assumed he was

1860
01:28:50,432 --> 01:28:51,456
He thought he was welcome

1861
01:28:51,968 --> 01:28:54,272
Coffee adrenaline of that

1862
01:28:54,528 --> 01:28:56,576
Maybe also some stimulants

1863
01:28:56,832 --> 01:29:00,160
But shutdown

1864
01:29:00,416 --> 01:29:01,184
From going to

1865
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:03,488
To the women for America First rally

1866
01:29:03,744 --> 01:29:08,352
You can tell them you can tell that that's that rally because you can hear the guy

1867
01:29:08,608 --> 01:29:09,888
In the background talking about the March

1868
01:29:10,144 --> 01:29:11,680
Search for Trump which was the bus

1869
01:29:11,936 --> 01:29:14,240
Tore that led to and culminated with

1870
01:29:14,496 --> 01:29:15,264
This women

1871
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:16,032
For Trump

1872
01:29:16,288 --> 01:29:17,568
America First rally

1873
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:19,616
I didn't hear him whining about Flags

1874
01:29:21,664 --> 01:29:23,712
84

1875
01:29:23,968 --> 01:29:26,016
So this rally was a much

1876
01:29:26,272 --> 01:29:28,320
Much less relevant to our folks

1877
01:29:29,344 --> 01:29:31,136
Let's direct Infowars connect

1878
01:29:31,392 --> 01:29:33,184
Alex wasn't allowed

1879
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:36,256
At this one he was allowed at the other show and they even let Owen

1880
01:29:36,512 --> 01:29:37,536
Shroyer on State

1881
01:29:38,048 --> 01:29:41,120
Holly Alexander was one of the organizers of the Jericho rally

1882
01:29:41,376 --> 01:29:45,216
Like I said there were a couple other Infowars people that you could find hanging around

1883
01:29:45,728 --> 01:29:49,568
In contrast this women for America First rally felt like people who are bit more into

1884
01:29:49,824 --> 01:29:50,848
Interested in being taken serious

1885
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:53,920
Issue with is that I can only

1886
01:29:54,176 --> 01:29:55,200
Find to real differ

1887
01:29:55,456 --> 01:29:55,968
Prince's between

1888
01:29:56,736 --> 01:30:00,064
One is it Alex was not allowed at the women for America first one

1889
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:01,856
And they also seem to mention

1890
01:30:02,112 --> 01:30:05,696
Political issues a little more than the Jericho

1891
01:30:06,208 --> 01:30:10,304
That was pretty solidly Focus not demanding Christian nationalism where is this one is

1892
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:12,096
Hiding a little bit in

1893
01:30:12,352 --> 01:30:14,144
Conservative politics big difference

1894
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:16,704
It's between the middle and far-right wings of the Republican

1895
01:30:17,728 --> 01:30:18,752
Desperately trying

1896
01:30:19,008 --> 01:30:19,520
2

1897
01:30:19,776 --> 01:30:20,544
A Subway

1898
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:23,360
Credible with their booking choices

1899
01:30:23,616 --> 01:30:24,896
Katrina Pierson

1900
01:30:25,152 --> 01:30:26,176
Seb Gorka

1901
01:30:26,432 --> 01:30:26,944
Yeah

1902
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:30,272
Very credible comparative

1903
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:33,088
I got there bigger names RaeLynn like

1904
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:36,160
Is Sebastian Gorka has a show that's in Decatur

1905
01:30:36,672 --> 01:30:37,184
Okay that's

1906
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:39,232
Alex is on Genesis communicate

1907
01:30:39,744 --> 01:30:42,816
Still amazing to me that sebgorka is just allowed to roam

1908
01:30:43,072 --> 01:30:43,840
Humphrey

1909
01:30:44,096 --> 01:30:45,376
And shockingly

1910
01:30:45,632 --> 01:30:46,656
I texted you about this

1911
01:30:46,912 --> 01:30:47,936
Last night what I was

1912
01:30:48,192 --> 01:30:48,704
I text

1913
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:50,752
To do that he seems like a character

1914
01:30:53,312 --> 01:30:56,640
How you not also heard much Sebastian Gorka

1915
01:30:56,896 --> 01:30:58,944
Except for maybe like a little Clips or

1916
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:05,344
Honestly a domian doing an impression of what you played for me so play less

1917
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:07,136
Honestly felt like watching that I was like

1918
01:31:07,392 --> 01:31:09,184
Sebastian gorkas leaving into the B

1919
01:31:14,304 --> 01:31:18,912
How big do parodies looking cell that sounds right that good

1920
01:31:19,168 --> 01:31:19,680
That like

1921
01:31:20,192 --> 01:31:22,240
They've really nail it cuz Cassie

1922
01:31:22,496 --> 01:31:23,264
He seemed liquor

1923
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:25,056
Farce yeah

1924
01:31:25,312 --> 01:31:27,104
I mean whenever your

1925
01:31:27,872 --> 01:31:30,176
Front lines are run by a

1926
01:31:30,432 --> 01:31:31,200
Hair dye

1927
01:31:31,456 --> 01:31:37,600
Bleeding Rudy Giuliani in front of a landscaping company are going to be just

1928
01:31:38,112 --> 01:31:40,416
Straight impression Rudy's the guy who hits the barbed wire

1929
01:31:42,208 --> 01:31:46,560
Originally intended that we would cover the entire rally

1930
01:31:46,816 --> 01:31:52,704
Of the women for America First just like the Jericho one

1931
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:57,568
Compatible with my goal of creating a decent show that people can enjoy

1932
01:31:57,824 --> 01:31:58,336
Just done rally

1933
01:31:58,592 --> 01:31:59,104
Is that were

1934
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:03,456
Mike Flynn in the my pillow guy basically give the exact same speeches at both

1935
01:32:03,712 --> 01:32:04,224
Rally's

1936
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:05,504
And the whole thing just

1937
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:09,088
Strike Zone way too long much like the other one with people just

1938
01:32:09,344 --> 01:32:10,112
Basically saying nothing

1939
01:32:10,368 --> 01:32:11,392
Like it's really

1940
01:32:11,648 --> 01:32:12,160
It's really

1941
01:32:12,928 --> 01:32:13,440
Vapid

1942
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:19,584
They have no actual substrates mostly getting people to chant about loving Trump in

1943
01:32:20,096 --> 01:32:20,864
Whatever

1944
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:23,168
That's f****** straight-up Nazi s***

1945
01:32:23,424 --> 01:32:27,008
I decided to possibly a better way to approach the women for America first

1946
01:32:27,264 --> 01:32:29,312
Rally what's the handouts

1947
01:32:29,824 --> 01:32:30,336
Superlative

1948
01:32:30,592 --> 01:32:32,640
As if this lineup was a bunch of

1949
01:32:32,896 --> 01:32:35,712
Matriculating graduating seniors in high school of it

1950
01:32:36,992 --> 01:32:38,784
The first are the first title I'd like to

1951
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:45,184
Bestow on someone feed

1952
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:45,952
Moose

1953
01:32:46,208 --> 01:32:48,256
Confusing breath of fresh air

1954
01:32:49,792 --> 01:32:51,840
What's up

1955
01:32:55,424 --> 01:32:56,192
How is General

1956
01:32:56,448 --> 01:32:58,496
When you guys was that amazing or what

1957
01:33:00,544 --> 01:33:02,848
Batman and his family

1958
01:33:03,616 --> 01:33:05,408
Laid it on the line

1959
01:33:05,664 --> 01:33:06,688
For our country

1960
01:33:06,944 --> 01:33:07,712
Over

1961
01:33:07,968 --> 01:33:12,576
And over and over again that we can't show them enough gratitude

1962
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:15,136
This guy is very clearly drunk

1963
01:33:15,392 --> 01:33:16,416
Felix

1964
01:33:16,672 --> 01:33:19,232
To be in his late 30s early 40s

1965
01:33:19,488 --> 01:33:21,024
When is wearing what appears to be a red

1966
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:23,328
Sequin smoking jacket

1967
01:33:24,096 --> 01:33:25,888
Now I'm back on board he's got a beard

1968
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:28,448
Drunk at like

1969
01:33:31,008 --> 01:33:37,152
I I live there but for the grace of God go idea is absolutely out of place at this rally and is the kids say I

1970
01:33:37,408 --> 01:33:38,944
I was here for it

1971
01:33:40,224 --> 01:33:45,344
Also I have no idea who he is you never says his name

1972
01:33:46,112 --> 01:33:51,744
I don't know I tried to find out I could not look at the comment to the YouTube video

1973
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:52,768
I Googled

1974
01:33:53,024 --> 01:33:56,352
Lineup of events I couldn't find that he was standing next to Alex on this

1975
01:33:56,608 --> 01:33:58,400
Security guard stop.

1976
01:33:58,656 --> 01:34:00,960
I'm going to go all through then but

1977
01:34:01,216 --> 01:34:03,776
Jeanette Lee like all things we discuss on this show that are

1978
01:34:04,032 --> 01:34:04,800
Kind of fun

1979
01:34:05,056 --> 01:34:05,824
He ended up revealing

1980
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:07,104
Himself to be a piece of s***

1981
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:11,200
But also in the same clip that he says something that I was really tickled by

1982
01:34:11,968 --> 01:34:12,736
Carefree Park

1983
01:34:12,992 --> 01:34:13,760
Dubai message

1984
01:34:14,528 --> 01:34:15,296
Well-armed

1985
01:34:15,808 --> 01:34:18,880
I lost all my contact tragic boating accident

1986
01:34:19,136 --> 01:34:19,648
What

1987
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:23,488
What just happened what did you just say to me

1988
01:34:24,512 --> 01:34:27,584
Second part about that one another person

1989
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:28,352
Stability

1990
01:34:29,888 --> 01:34:30,656
Something that we have to

1991
01:34:30,912 --> 01:34:32,192
A lot with what becomes

1992
01:34:32,448 --> 01:34:38,592
Come on

1993
01:34:39,104 --> 01:34:40,896
Boating accident I was expected

1994
01:34:41,152 --> 01:34:43,200
I'm not sure if that is a joke

1995
01:34:43,456 --> 01:34:47,552
Actually had a boating accident cut off discs

1996
01:34:48,064 --> 01:34:50,880
Why would you say tragic boating accident nothing specific

1997
01:34:51,392 --> 01:34:53,952
Either pretty funny as a joke

1998
01:34:54,208 --> 01:35:00,352
Like I I don't have any guns I've lost enough but tragic boating accident that I would toss off if I was asking somewhere

1999
01:35:03,168 --> 01:35:05,728
Not a bad throw away

2000
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:12,384
Also could be real and I want to know the table underneath is true

2001
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:15,200
Los Alamos

2002
01:35:15,456 --> 01:35:16,992
To be an engagement present

2003
01:35:17,248 --> 01:35:20,576
You've got this weird

2004
01:35:22,624 --> 01:35:28,768
Why do you say that f****** racist blue stuff it's a little bit like I erase

2005
01:35:29,536 --> 01:35:30,560
Right winger

2006
01:35:30,816 --> 01:35:31,840
Play by Kyle Kinane

2007
01:35:33,632 --> 01:35:35,936
I had no idea what is going on

2008
01:35:36,192 --> 01:35:40,032
I don't know who he is he doesn't introduce himself no one says

2009
01:35:40,288 --> 01:35:41,056
Huggies on

2010
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:42,848
TV

2011
01:35:43,104 --> 01:35:45,152
Stream of it there's no damn on the Chiron

2012
01:35:45,408 --> 01:35:46,176
No idea

2013
01:35:46,432 --> 01:35:51,040
I have no idea

2014
01:35:51,552 --> 01:35:52,064
He introduces

2015
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:52,832
Who's the person who has the

2016
01:35:53,088 --> 01:35:54,880
The same name as a big celebrity

2017
01:35:55,136 --> 01:35:56,928
But does not appear to be that celebrity

2018
01:35:57,440 --> 01:35:58,208
You will never

2019
01:35:58,464 --> 01:35:59,232
Stand for it

2020
01:35:59,488 --> 01:36:01,536
We're going to keep coming back

2021
01:36:02,048 --> 01:36:03,072
A pillet stone

2022
01:36:03,584 --> 01:36:04,608
And our president

2023
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:07,168
The greatest president ever

2024
01:36:08,448 --> 01:36:12,544
Where is supposed to be

2025

Keep it brief

2027
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:19,200
I don't want that trouble

2028
01:36:19,456 --> 01:36:20,480
Jennifer Lawrence

2029
01:36:20,736 --> 01:36:26,880
Come up and talk to everybody it is not Jennifer Lawrence

2030
01:36:28,672 --> 01:36:31,488
I don't know who is Jennifer Lawrence's either

2031
01:36:31,744 --> 01:36:37,888
I thought maybe if I figured out who she is still have no idea

2032
01:36:38,144 --> 01:36:40,192
Anybody is coupled

2033
01:36:40,448 --> 01:36:46,592
Crashed the White House Party and everybody's like if it is I love it

2034
01:36:46,848 --> 01:36:47,872
Jennifer Lawrence

2035
01:36:48,128 --> 01:36:49,408
Nightly Christian Nash

2036
01:36:49,664 --> 01:36:50,176
Nationalized

2037
01:36:50,688 --> 01:36:52,736
People on that hill over there

2038
01:36:52,992 --> 01:36:53,760
I need to remember

2039
01:36:54,016 --> 01:36:55,296
They work for us

2040
01:36:55,552 --> 01:36:58,368
We the people that we do work for that

2041
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:01,440
We have to die

2042
01:37:01,696 --> 01:37:03,232
Not government and goddess

2043
01:37:03,488 --> 01:37:04,256
Can I tell us who's going to be

2044
01:37:04,512 --> 01:37:05,024
Be the president

2045
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:06,816
Wait what

2046
01:37:07,072 --> 01:37:09,120
Countries going to go and we are going to fight

2047
01:37:09,632 --> 01:37:10,144

So then even if you get here

2052
01:37:17,312 --> 01:37:18,848
Present you're still not going to do with the

2053
01:37:19,104 --> 01:37:19,616
The government says

2054
01:37:20,128 --> 01:37:20,640
I guess not

2055
01:37:21,152 --> 01:37:27,296
Either way congratulations to clearly day drunk guy in the sequence smoking jacket you have won the very coveted title

2056
01:37:27,808 --> 01:37:32,672
Most confusing breath of fresh air

Pretty close to

The next award that I'm going to give out the next superlative is the best

2063
01:37:50,336 --> 01:37:52,128
Integration of promotional messaging

2064
01:37:52,384 --> 01:37:53,152
Into a stump speech

2065
01:37:55,712 --> 01:37:58,528
No my pillow might be involved

2066
01:37:58,784 --> 01:38:00,064

3 million followers on Facebook 1.1 on Instagram

Plug in his website

2098
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:24,544
That is all just

2099
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:25,568
In order to

2100
01:39:25,824 --> 01:39:26,592

Which is

2103
01:39:30,176 --> 01:39:30,688
The solution Two-Face

2104
01:39:30,944 --> 01:39:31,456
Facebook

2105
01:39:31,968 --> 01:39:35,552
I hear people talk about parlor parlor is amazing it's a great alternative to Twitter

2106
01:39:35,808 --> 01:39:37,344
But we need an alternative to face

2107
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:38,112
Facebook

2108
01:39:38,624 --> 01:39:39,392
Southern Network

2109
01:39:39,648 --> 01:39:40,416
Albright's

2110
01:39:40,672 --> 01:39:42,720
Like Facebook and I found it I'm going to

2111
01:39:42,976 --> 01:39:44,256
Talkin about it loud

2112
01:39:44,512 --> 01:39:46,816
I got a lot of my friends really talk about it loud

2113
01:39:47,072 --> 01:39:47,584
It's called

2114
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:48,864
Springleaf Stanford

2115
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:49,888

2117
01:39:52,704 --> 01:39:53,216

Ly

2119
01:39:55,264 --> 01:39:56,800
Spell you're going to hear a lot about that

2120
01:39:57,056 --> 01:39:58,848
And they're going to dominate Facebook

2121
01:39:59,104 --> 01:39:59,872
Going to guess they're not

2122
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:04,480
People like a lot of them seem to be pushing

2123
01:40:04,736 --> 01:40:05,760
Internet startup

2124
01:40:06,528 --> 01:40:09,344
Like there was one guy who came to Alex's seapak

2125
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:11,904
He was trying to push a search at

2126
01:40:12,416 --> 01:40:16,512
Like it I think that they're really trying to make a little bit of a fast

2127
01:40:16,768 --> 01:40:21,120
I'll meet conservative aggrievement over social media mark

2128
01:40:21,376 --> 01:40:23,424
I mean this is what this is what I'm saying when I

2129
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:26,752
When I say like I feel for these idiots in the crowd here like

2130
01:40:27,008 --> 01:40:27,776
You guys

2131
01:40:28,288 --> 01:40:31,616
Are being sold the idea that you can legally just

2132
01:40:31,872 --> 01:40:32,896
Get whatever you want

2133
01:40:33,152 --> 01:40:33,664
What's the longest

2134
01:40:34,176 --> 01:40:34,688
Like

2135
01:40:34,944 --> 01:40:37,760
Adelphi lawsuits and then we'll get whatever we want cuz we're right

2136
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:39,552
And there

2137
01:40:39,808 --> 01:40:41,344
Telling you all of this like

2138
01:40:41,856 --> 01:40:42,368
And when

2139
01:40:42,624 --> 01:40:43,648
This happens

2140
01:40:43,904 --> 01:40:50,048
Which we totally know it's going to they will keep us from having to do the one thing that we know is the only

2141
01:40:50,304 --> 01:40:52,608
Only way to get what we want to achieve and we're trying to avoid

2142
01:40:52,864 --> 01:40:56,960
And it's like you're just being taken Along by these guys who are selling you on

2143
01:40:58,496 --> 01:41:00,544
No one's going to go on spreely

2144
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:03,616
He also

2145
01:41:03,872 --> 01:41:04,384
Has perfected

2146
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:06,432
This this this technique

2147
01:41:06,688 --> 01:41:08,480
It's David Harris has of

2148
01:41:09,248 --> 01:41:10,272
Protected prayer

2149
01:41:10,528 --> 01:41:13,088
Lord's Prayer

2150
01:41:13,344 --> 01:41:15,648
Take every line of it and think about what

2151
01:41:17,184 --> 01:41:21,792
Yeah are we going to get in the bridge so long

2152
01:41:22,048 --> 01:41:23,840
6 minutes

2153
01:41:25,376 --> 01:41:27,936
This is the end of it and that house smoothly a transition

2154
01:41:28,192 --> 01:41:29,728

01:43:57,440 --> 01:44:03,584
I'm out of here

2214
01:44:05,376 --> 01:44:07,936
Would have given Melissa Corona speaking

2215
01:44:08,192 --> 01:44:14,336
Spot if she tasked totally like yeah I don't really want to do this I want to do it but I do want my name

2216
01:44:14,592 --> 01:44:17,920
They're just in case I would like my attention

2217
01:44:18,176 --> 01:44:19,712
But I do not want to do the work for it

2218
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:20,992
Yeah

2219
01:44:21,504 --> 01:44:22,272

2231
01:45:05,024 --> 01:45:07,072

Marjorie Greene

2238
01:45:32,672 --> 01:45:36,256
That was one of those like curveballs in terms of like they're booking

2239
01:45:36,512 --> 01:45:37,792
I feel like you guys are

2240
01:45:38,048 --> 01:45:38,816
Trying to

2241
01:45:39,584 --> 01:45:40,608
Habanero

2242
01:45:40,864 --> 01:45:41,888
Yeah it's not

2243
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:43,936
Out there too far

2244
01:45:44,192 --> 01:45:45,728
The craziest congressperson we could

2245
01:45:46,240 --> 01:45:47,264
Well

2246
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:49,056
Chianti Santana video

2247
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:50,592
It's not good

2248
01:45:51,104 --> 01:45:55,968
Could be better overthrowing democracy is not always the most popular thing to do

2249
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:56,992
True

2250
01:45:57,248 --> 01:45:58,528
Jordan

2251
01:45:58,784 --> 01:46:04,160
Is the second most likely day drunk person after the guy in a sequined shirt he's one hundred percent

2252
01:46:04,416 --> 01:46:08,000
Yes there's there's no competition

2253
01:46:09,024 --> 01:46:10,048
Play so ever

2254
01:46:10,304 --> 01:46:12,096
Most likely that honor goes to

2255
01:46:12,608 --> 01:46:13,888
Boris epshteyn

2256
01:46:14,144 --> 01:46:15,168
Who I should remind you

2257
01:46:15,424 --> 01:46:18,240
Guy from Sinclair

2258
01:46:18,496 --> 01:46:20,288
Tested positive for covid-19

2259
01:46:20,544 --> 01:46:22,080
On November 26th REI

2260
01:46:22,336 --> 01:46:23,104
He showed up and he

2261
01:46:25,408 --> 01:46:26,944
Hello lover.

2262
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:30,784
I was told I shouldn't

2263
01:46:31,296 --> 01:46:32,064
My call but I'm going to do it any

2264
01:46:38,208 --> 01:46:39,488
We love Trump

2265
01:46:42,304 --> 01:46:43,072
Why

2266
01:46:43,328 --> 01:46:44,864
Trump

2267
01:46:45,376 --> 01:46:46,400
We love Trump

2268
01:46:51,264 --> 01:46:52,800
Google viberider

2269
01:46:55,104 --> 01:46:56,384
We love Trump

2270
01:46:56,896 --> 01:46:58,176
We love Trump

2271
01:46:58,688 --> 01:46:59,712
We love Trump

2272
01:46:59,968 --> 01:47:01,504
I love that Boris

2273
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:02,272
Is like

2274
01:47:02,528 --> 01:47:07,904
Apparently didn't hear everyone yelling to put the flags down

2275
01:47:08,160 --> 01:47:09,184
Did those words up

2276
01:47:10,976 --> 01:47:14,048
Two different events people have been saying put the flags down so we could

2277
01:47:14,304 --> 01:47:15,840
Extreme at bars I got f***** at

2278
01:47:16,352 --> 01:47:17,632
I don't know if

2279
01:47:17,888 --> 01:47:20,448
Actually drunk it's really tough to tell cuz it also

2280
01:47:20,704 --> 01:47:22,240
I realized as I was watching

2281
01:47:22,496 --> 01:47:24,288
It's hard to tell the difference

2282
01:47:24,544 --> 01:47:26,592
What's between like maybe kind of day drunk

2283
01:47:26,848 --> 01:47:27,616
Buzzed and

2284
01:47:28,128 --> 01:47:30,944
Sort of just jacked up off of being in front of a crowd list

2285
01:47:33,504 --> 01:47:34,016
Like

2286
01:47:34,528 --> 01:47:37,088
Standard guitar pumped up time

2287
01:47:39,136 --> 01:47:39,648
You do that in

2288
01:47:39,904 --> 01:47:41,952
Those are the kind of things that you

2289
01:47:42,208 --> 01:47:43,488
Instinctually do when you're drunk

2290
01:47:44,768 --> 01:47:46,816
USA

2291
01:47:49,376 --> 01:47:50,144
I can't

2292
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:51,936
This is maybe the largest

2293
01:47:52,192 --> 01:47:53,728
Disconnect more than our politics

2294
01:47:54,752 --> 01:47:56,544
The idea any

2295
01:47:56,800 --> 01:47:58,080
The idea of saying

2296
01:47:58,336 --> 01:48:00,384
I have me chanting we love

2297
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:01,664
Yeah like politician

2298
01:48:02,176 --> 01:48:02,688
F***

2299
01:48:02,944 --> 01:48:03,712
That

2300
01:48:03,968 --> 01:48:04,736
Siri

2301
01:48:04,992 --> 01:48:05,760
Seems weird

2302
01:48:06,272 --> 01:48:06,784
Aerie

2303
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:07,552
Yeah

2304
01:48:07,808 --> 01:48:10,624
I think AOC is incredible I'm not going to

2305
01:48:11,648 --> 01:48:13,184
We love AOC f*****

2306
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:16,512
I tell myself that I think I would be just as a

2307
01:48:16,768 --> 01:48:17,792
Like put off

2308
01:48:18,048 --> 01:48:18,816
By seeing large

2309
01:48:19,072 --> 01:48:22,144
Crowds chanted we love Obama back in 2000

2310
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:23,424
But maybe I wouldn't have

2311
01:48:23,936 --> 01:48:25,472
Maybe that's a bias on my part

2312
01:48:25,728 --> 01:48:28,032
I don't know I thought I'd like to think that I would be where

2313
01:48:28,288 --> 01:48:30,848
But I'm not certain I were much younger than

2314
01:48:31,104 --> 01:48:36,480
Do you know Obama was coming out after the previous worst.

2315
01:48:36,736 --> 01:48:38,016
I like to think

2316
01:48:38,272 --> 01:48:39,296
That I would respond

2317
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:41,600
The same would be like

2318
01:48:41,856 --> 01:48:43,392
But I wonder if I would

2319
01:48:43,648 --> 01:48:48,768
See that and I would give the like her like personality this is just Express

2320
01:48:49,024 --> 01:48:51,584
Kissing their political

2321
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:53,632
I mean I wouldn't I don't know

2322
01:48:53,888 --> 01:48:55,168
Obama Jordan

2323
01:48:55,424 --> 01:48:55,936
That was

2324
01:48:56,448 --> 01:48:58,496
Significantly long ago I would say the most

2325
01:48:59,008 --> 01:49:03,616
Recent is obviously the Bernie Sanders campaign in the primary in 2016

2326
01:49:04,128 --> 01:49:07,456
Whenever he had those massive rallies but even then I don't remember people's

2327
01:49:07,712 --> 01:49:13,856
Screaming like really chanting like feelthebern something like that phrase

2328
01:49:14,112 --> 01:49:15,136
All in This Together not like

2329
01:49:15,392 --> 01:49:20,000
We love you was not me us

2330
01:49:20,256 --> 01:49:21,280
So

2331
01:49:21,792 --> 01:49:25,120
We love us I would be fine with chanting that

2332
01:49:25,376 --> 01:49:26,912
Yeah yeah I don't know it

2333
01:49:27,168 --> 01:49:29,472
It's it's it's tough I know that I don't like looking at it

2334
01:49:29,728 --> 01:49:34,848
Here and I like to I like to think that maybe even if I had turned a blind eye to it

2335
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:35,872
Before

2336
01:49:36,128 --> 01:49:37,664
I would now look upon

2337
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:38,944
People chanting like let's

2338
01:49:39,200 --> 01:49:42,016
Play I love AOC whatever I would look at that

2339
01:49:42,272 --> 01:49:43,296
Much differently

2340
01:49:43,552 --> 01:49:46,368
Maybe this is giving me an Illuminating moment

2341
01:49:46,624 --> 01:49:47,648
Superlative

2342
01:49:47,904 --> 01:49:48,672
Title

2343
01:49:50,976 --> 01:49:53,024
Person who's putting the most

2344
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:54,304
Direct

2345
01:49:55,584 --> 01:49:57,632
I didn't prepare this time

2346
01:49:57,888 --> 01:50:03,008
This one's a little bit off the dummy person putting the most effort into getting people killed

2347
01:50:03,264 --> 01:50:09,152
That goes to I don't remember his name but he's that gym owner in New Jersey who I would use it to stay closed

2348
01:50:09,920 --> 01:50:11,200
If you would have asked me

2349
01:50:11,712 --> 01:50:12,736
Back in February

2350
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:14,784
If I thought that one person

2351
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:15,552
We can make a difference

2352
01:50:16,064 --> 01:50:16,576
I want to laugh

2353
01:50:16,832 --> 01:50:17,600
And said hell no

2354
01:50:17,856 --> 01:50:19,136
But here I am today

2355
01:50:19,392 --> 01:50:20,416
One Man Apart of

2356
01:50:20,672 --> 01:50:21,696
Team of two guys

2357
01:50:22,208 --> 01:50:22,720
Bristol

2358
01:50:22,976 --> 01:50:23,744
Governor told him

2359
01:50:24,256 --> 01:50:26,816
No we will not listen

2360
01:50:29,888 --> 01:50:33,728
And it started moving across the country they're trying that second way that they've been

2361
01:50:33,984 --> 01:50:35,264
Predicting for so long

2362
01:50:36,032 --> 01:50:36,800
And more more busy

2363
01:50:37,312 --> 01:50:37,824
They're staying open

2364
01:50:39,104 --> 01:50:40,640
I don't hear The Advocate every

2365
01:50:40,896 --> 01:50:41,408
Single

2366
01:50:41,664 --> 01:50:43,456
Freedom-loving American Eagle outlet

2367
01:50:43,712 --> 01:50:44,736
Support these small business

2368
01:50:47,808 --> 01:50:49,344
And I'm going to give you away how

2369
01:50:51,136 --> 01:50:52,416
We created directory

2370
01:50:52,672 --> 01:50:54,208
Nationwide directory of business

2371
01:50:55,744 --> 01:50:56,768
Been thinking about Yelp

2372
01:50:57,280 --> 01:50:58,560
Freedom-loving American

2373
01:50:59,584 --> 01:51:00,352
K restriction

2374
01:51:01,632 --> 01:51:02,144
I have a

2375
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:03,424
Climate plan

2376
01:51:03,680 --> 01:51:04,192
Support

2377
01:51:05,472 --> 01:51:06,496
That is ww.w.

01:51:06,752 --> 01:51:07,264
Australia Open

Interstate free.com

2380
01:51:10,336 --> 01:51:10,848
Check it out

2381
01:51:11,360 --> 01:51:11,872
Going card

2382
01:51:12,640 --> 01:51:13,664
Is the sign up at ghost

2383
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:14,432
Support them

2384
01:51:14,688 --> 01:51:16,480
Because the more that do the Quakers thing

2385
01:51:16,736 --> 01:51:17,760
Fall apart I promise you

2386
01:51:18,272 --> 01:51:19,808
This works equally well as a

2387
01:51:20,064 --> 01:51:21,856
Registry of businesses to avoid

2388
01:51:22,368 --> 01:51:23,136
Yep yep

2389
01:51:23,904 --> 01:51:28,000
Wow I didn't think that one man could make a difference

2390
01:51:28,256 --> 01:51:29,536
But now look at me

2391
01:51:29,792 --> 01:51:31,328
The Horseman of plague

2392
01:51:35,424 --> 01:51:36,448
Yeah good

2393
01:51:36,704 --> 01:51:37,216
Is Christ

2394
01:51:37,472 --> 01:51:38,240
King Midas

2395
01:51:38,496 --> 01:51:40,288
Not age well

2396
01:51:40,544 --> 01:51:46,688
So I went and I looked at this guy's registry and I look for Chicago there is exactly one business

2397
01:51:46,944 --> 01:51:47,456
In the city of

2398
01:51:47,712 --> 01:51:51,296
Chicago and it is an apartment building

2399
01:51:52,064 --> 01:51:53,344
Pictures of all right

2400
01:51:53,600 --> 01:51:56,416
Do you want to

2401
01:51:56,672 --> 01:51:57,952
I guess yeah

2402
01:51:58,208 --> 01:51:59,232
Seems silly

2403
01:51:59,488 --> 01:52:05,632
Is it Gold Coast Apartments

2404
01:52:05,888 --> 01:52:12,032
This is what that was for I think this is more about like

2405
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:15,872
Superlative

2406
01:52:16,128 --> 01:52:17,408
Is actually a tie

2407
01:52:17,664 --> 01:52:18,432
This is very shocked

2408
01:52:19,200 --> 01:52:20,480
Most insane preacher

2409
01:52:20,736 --> 01:52:23,296
There's two

2410
01:52:23,552 --> 01:52:28,160
The first ghost goes to block

2411
01:52:28,672 --> 01:52:29,696
Out of Tennessee

2412
01:52:30,720 --> 01:52:35,072
If you're glad to be on The Winning Side let's make some noise CC

2413
01:52:37,120 --> 01:52:43,264
This thing is going to turn out alright

2414
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:44,032
Backup

2415
01:52:44,288 --> 01:52:46,080
We're not going to pack up when I going to

2416
01:52:46,336 --> 01:52:50,176

How do you map my snakes

2421
01:53:04,256 --> 01:53:08,096
We're getting a lot of different particular flavors

2422
01:53:08,352 --> 01:53:09,888
Exciting preachers

2423
01:53:10,144 --> 01:53:11,936
That's why it has to be a tithe

2424
01:53:12,192 --> 01:53:12,704
These guys are

2425
01:53:12,960 --> 01:53:14,496
Completely different styles

2426
01:53:14,752 --> 01:53:16,032
But

2427
01:53:16,288 --> 01:53:18,336
Masterlock who-knows-what

2428
01:53:18,592 --> 01:53:19,616
He does not ask

2429
01:53:19,872 --> 01:53:23,712
Permission what he wants to tell the devil that the devil is on notice

2430
01:53:24,480 --> 01:53:28,832

01:53:38,048 --> 01:53:39,840
He's he's very exciting

2435
01:53:40,096 --> 01:53:40,864
Verbally

2436
01:53:41,120 --> 01:53:42,144
Yeah that's why I

2437
01:53:43,168 --> 01:53:49,312
I've never had the devil of a goddamn piece of provision but I'll tell you that right now everybody

2438

Stu yell about how everyone will be forced to bow in front of Jesus

2440
01:54:04,928 --> 01:54:05,952
The name of Jesus

2441
01:54:06,208 --> 01:54:08,256
Every knee shall bow of things in heaven

2442
01:54:08,512 --> 01:54:09,536
10 things in Earth

2443
01:54:10,304 --> 01:54:15,424
Thanks unto the Earth handed a republican-democrat

And with their voice Proclaim him Lord of Lord

2445
01:54:20,032 --> 01:54:20,800
To the glory of God

2446
01:54:21,056 --> 01:54:22,592
So you have a choice

2447
01:54:23,616 --> 01:54:24,384
Endochoice

2448
01:54:24,896 --> 01:54:25,408
Is cleared

2449
01:54:26,432 --> 01:54:30,528
We can declare Jesus Lord of our life right now because we want to

2450
01:54:31,040 --> 01:54:35,392
Or we can declare Jesus Christ Our Life in the day of judgement

2451
01:54:35,648 --> 01:54:37,952
Because we have to but make no mistake

2452
01:54:38,208 --> 01:54:38,720
Cheese's

01:54:46,912 --> 01:54:49,216
That guy is scary

2457
01:54:49,472 --> 01:54:51,008
And I'm anyways

2458
01:54:51,264 --> 01:54:53,312
But is it local patterns are fun

2459
01:54:53,568 --> 01:54:54,848
It's all good I'm mad

2460
01:54:55,104 --> 01:54:55,872
Oh okay

2461
01:54:57,152 --> 01:55:02,272
To the next guy who's tied here for this almost insane preacher is a guy named Brian Gibbs

2462
01:55:02,528 --> 01:55:04,064
This kind of endearing

2463
01:55:04,320 --> 01:55:05,344
His wife

2464
01:55:05,600 --> 01:55:06,624
Brings him up

2465
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:08,416
Reduces amongst

2466
01:55:08,672 --> 01:55:10,464
Do you know that it's his wife

2467
01:55:10,720 --> 01:55:11,488
Initially

2468
01:55:11,744 --> 01:55:12,256
Because she's just like

2469
01:55:12,512 --> 01:55:14,816
This next over speaker is okay

2470
01:55:15,072 --> 01:55:16,352
Which is my favorite person

2471
01:55:16,608 --> 01:55:18,912

Is Easter Service didn't work out he's going to try and give eggs to children

2479
01:55:31,200 --> 01:55:33,760
Only Easter Sunday I blew a fuse

01:55:34,528 --> 01:55:37,600
I'll put together an Easter egg giveaway we were going to give

2481
01:55:37,856 --> 01:55:39,648

01:56:00,640 --> 01:56:01,920
Number to tell you

2492
01:56:02,176 --> 01:56:03,712
No one has the authority

2493
01:56:03,968 --> 01:56:05,248
To shutdown

2494
01:56:05,504 --> 01:56:07,040
Uncle Lord Jesus Christ

2495
01:56:07,296 --> 01:56:09,344

Cuz I'd love to go to jail

2505
01:56:32,640 --> 01:56:33,920
For the preaching of the Gospel

2506
01:56:34,176 --> 01:56:40,320
That's not what you'd be going to jail for certain you are not actually preaching gospel

2507
01:56:40,576 --> 01:56:44,928
What's up with that

2508
01:56:45,184 --> 01:56:48,512
What is up with that how I can't get arrested for preaching

2509
01:56:49,024 --> 01:56:49,792
Wow for boy

2510
01:56:50,048 --> 01:56:55,680
Kind of a little bit telling her that he would not make the cut if it weren't

2511
01:56:55,936 --> 01:56:56,448
4

2512
01:56:56,704 --> 01:56:57,472

Christian nationalist

2515
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:01,824
Let me say this

2516
01:57:03,872 --> 01:57:05,920
America did not birth chart

2517
01:57:08,224 --> 01:57:09,504
America did not burn

2518
01:57:11,552 --> 01:57:12,320
Bethel Church

2519
01:57:12,576 --> 01:57:13,856
Birth of America

Excuse me

2523
01:57:17,184 --> 01:57:19,488
Only thing that will save America

2524
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:21,536
It's the same thing that burst

2525
01:57:21,792 --> 01:57:22,304
America

2526
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:24,608
The Church of the Lord Jesus Christ

2527
01:57:24,864 --> 01:57:29,472
Yeah I mean this is going to go with King George but I guess I was wrong

2528
01:57:29,728 --> 01:57:31,776
Nope you're absolutely wrong

2529
01:57:32,032 --> 01:57:36,384
What about that whole no taxation without representation thing wasn't that really important or was

2530
01:57:36,896 --> 01:57:37,408
Is just church

2531
01:57:38,176 --> 01:57:38,688
Alright

2532
01:57:38,944 --> 01:57:42,016
Okay you realize that like the Puritans were kicked out

2533
01:57:43,040 --> 01:57:43,552
Cuz they

2534
01:57:44,064 --> 01:57:44,576
Hated them

2535
01:57:45,344 --> 01:57:49,184
Cuz everybody hated cuz there's no work cease to preachers

2536
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:51,232
Are at the one that is not

2537
01:57:51,744 --> 01:57:54,560
The more religious branded one

2538
01:57:54,816 --> 01:57:57,632
That wasn't the product of a vision

2539
01:57:57,888 --> 01:57:58,400
Yeah

2540
01:57:59,424 --> 01:58:05,568
So I'm 23 I'm trying to tell you that all of this is

2541
01:58:06,592 --> 01:58:07,616
Religious people

2542
01:58:08,128 --> 01:58:10,944
Come get your guys or you get what you get man

2543
01:58:14,784 --> 01:58:16,576
I don't blame decent

2544
01:58:16,832 --> 01:58:17,856
Religious people for this

2545
01:58:18,112 --> 01:58:18,880
I believe religion

2546
01:58:20,416 --> 01:58:22,976
That's an interesting conversation I don't want to have right now

2547
01:58:23,488 --> 01:58:27,328
I do not want to give out the next to the last

2548
01:58:27,584 --> 01:58:28,608
This goes to the most

2549
01:58:28,864 --> 01:58:30,656
Bewildering transition between

2550
01:58:30,912 --> 01:58:31,680
Queen speakers

2551
01:58:32,960 --> 01:58:33,728
This begins

2552
01:58:33,984 --> 01:58:36,800
The woman whose name is either Anna Kate or Anna Cay

2553
01:58:37,056 --> 01:58:40,640
Intro

2554
01:58:40,896 --> 01:58:41,920
The internet

2555
01:58:42,176 --> 01:58:48,320
He's probably really did some damage to the

2556
01:58:48,576 --> 01:58:49,344
The rich family

2557
01:58:49,600 --> 01:58:51,392
The Seth rich

2558
01:58:51,648 --> 01:58:52,160
I don't know what the

2559
01:58:52,416 --> 01:58:54,720
Dafuq anyone's doing ever letting him in public

2560
01:58:54,976 --> 01:58:58,048
Intro to either Anna

2561
01:58:59,328 --> 01:59:00,096
No idea

2562
01:59:00,608 --> 01:59:02,912
ZZ Top she's a very devout

2563
01:59:03,424 --> 01:59:03,936
Worshiper

2564
01:59:04,192 --> 01:59:05,472
Who's apparently been in

2565
01:59:05,728 --> 01:59:07,520
Prayer for 40 days straight

2566
01:59:08,032 --> 01:59:10,848
Then I guess he's breaking that now to give the people of this rally an update

2567
01:59:11,104 --> 01:59:12,128
How dare you

2568
01:59:12,384 --> 01:59:14,176
F****** lie like that you might

2569
01:59:14,688 --> 01:59:16,992
Prophecy his promise

2570
01:59:17,248 --> 01:59:18,272
The Trump will be given

2571
01:59:18,528 --> 01:59:19,808
Consecutive terms

2572
01:59:20,064 --> 01:59:20,576
So therefore

2573
01:59:20,832 --> 01:59:21,600
You must have one

2574
01:59:22,112 --> 01:59:23,136
After saying this

2575
01:59:24,160 --> 01:59:24,672
She's got a message

2576
01:59:24,928 --> 01:59:25,440
Search for the devil

2577
01:59:26,976 --> 01:59:28,512
Message is for the devil

To bring Justice back into the country

2586
01:59:47,456 --> 01:59:49,504
I do worry that I'm one of the wizard

2587
01:59:49,760 --> 01:59:51,040
Yeah I'm pretty sure you're a wizard

2588
01:59:51,296 --> 01:59:57,440
Yeah why did I think that no matter what the reality is I would be looked upon as a wizard early but the devil

2589
01:59:57,696 --> 02:00:00,768
No it doesn't matter even if there was no religion

County three-wheeler can't change Jesus

This was a picture I had a few weeks ago

02:00:45,312 --> 02:00:46,080
Because it's a ship

2606
02:00:46,336 --> 02:00:49,408
Singing mystere now in Jesus name when we repent

2607
02:00:49,664 --> 02:00:51,200
Before we trying to think what we repent

2608
02:00:51,456 --> 02:00:53,504
For all the blood sacrifice that has been

2609
02:00:54,528 --> 02:00:56,064
Bored out and it's National

Apartment

2645
02:02:33,856 --> 02:02:35,648
We all need to move around with this might though

2646
02:02:36,160 --> 02:02:36,672
Alright

2647
02:02:37,184 --> 02:02:43,328
So what's happened here is that we started with the lady chanting Jesus

2648
02:02:43,584 --> 02:02:44,608
For the devil in The Whispers

2649
02:02:45,120 --> 02:02:51,264
And then my drunk friend comes to me

2650
02:02:51,520 --> 02:02:53,056
Better Business

2651
02:02:53,312 --> 02:02:54,848
He introduces a wrap

2652
02:02:55,360 --> 02:02:57,152
There's a rap concert you know

2653
02:02:57,920 --> 02:02:58,432
It's just

2654
02:02:58,688 --> 02:03:04,832
It was easier to have religious epiphanies before technology I imagine during The Sermon on the Mount was

2655
02:03:05,088 --> 02:03:06,880
Peter like hey guys

2656
02:03:08,160 --> 02:03:10,976
We are leaving too much bread around

2657
02:03:11,488 --> 02:03:17,632
There is a lot of bread going around on the floors and it's attracting too many birds birds are getting in the shot

2658
02:03:19,424 --> 02:03:21,728
And now a rap concert on the map

2659
02:03:23,008 --> 02:03:29,152
Bryson gray comes out to do a little wraps at

2660
02:03:29,408 --> 02:03:31,200
Albums that he's put out

2661
02:03:31,456 --> 02:03:37,600
Maga Seasons from SVN another one

2662
02:03:41,184 --> 02:03:44,512
Another another album called Maga ain't got no color

2663
02:03:47,328 --> 02:03:49,888
Add is other album can't cancel God

2664
02:03:50,656 --> 02:03:53,984
His label who wanted the Christmas album Amor was

2665
02:03:56,288 --> 02:03:58,592
So I went and I listen to a little bit of his

2666
02:03:58,848 --> 02:03:59,360
Stuff

2667
02:03:59,616 --> 02:04:00,896
I got to say he's service

2668
02:04:01,408 --> 02:04:02,944
As an actual rapper

2669
02:04:03,456 --> 02:04:03,968
You got it.

2670
02:04:04,224 --> 02:04:04,736
Good

2671
02:04:04,992 --> 02:04:08,320
The Lira sisters someone who's delivering

2672
02:04:08,832 --> 02:04:10,112
Words over beat

2673
02:04:10,368 --> 02:04:12,928
Sure sure sure sure it's not as bad as a lot of people I've hurt

2674
02:04:13,184 --> 02:04:14,208
I will say that

2675
02:04:14,720 --> 02:04:15,232
I think

2676
02:04:15,488 --> 02:04:16,512
He's just not he's not anything

2677
02:04:16,768 --> 02:04:18,304
Interesting to help find anything

2678
02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:19,328
Sing compelling about it

2679
02:04:19,840 --> 02:04:20,608
It's largely just like

2680
02:04:20,864 --> 02:04:21,376
Rapping

2681
02:04:21,888 --> 02:04:22,656
And I'm sort of

2682
02:04:22,912 --> 02:04:24,960
Conspiracy talking point drop sheds

2683
02:04:25,216 --> 02:04:30,336
I don't really care but I went I actually found a review of one of his album okay because

2684
02:04:30,592 --> 02:04:32,640
They can review really agreed with me like

2685
02:04:32,896 --> 02:04:36,224
He's not terrible but this is boring

2686
02:04:39,552 --> 02:04:40,064
Insulting

2687
02:04:43,392 --> 02:04:47,232
Not doing anything interesting it's kind of uncompelling you have some

2688
02:04:47,488 --> 02:04:49,024
Scale or whatever man

2689
02:04:50,560 --> 02:04:51,328
Honestly I

2690
02:04:51,584 --> 02:04:52,608
Your politics

2691
02:04:52,864 --> 02:04:56,960
I do hate them but we're talkin about the music here but you could deliver your politics

2692
02:04:57,216 --> 02:04:58,496
Interesting art

2693
02:04:59,008 --> 02:05:00,544
Pickway I might

2694
02:05:01,568 --> 02:05:07,712
Appreciate what you make either I disagree with what you're sure you're putting out I might be able to get there but

2695
02:05:07,968 --> 02:05:10,528
Boring as hell like everybody knows Cecil DeMille

2696
02:05:10,784 --> 02:05:11,552
Okay we get

2697
02:05:12,064 --> 02:05:15,904
So he comes out with another rapper whose name I forget

2698
02:05:16,160 --> 02:05:17,440
Cuz I don't care

2699
02:05:17,952 --> 02:05:18,720
But

2700
02:05:18,976 --> 02:05:19,744
They have

2701
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:20,512
Sotech issues

2702
02:05:20,768 --> 02:05:21,280
At the beginning

2703
02:05:21,536 --> 02:05:23,584
And so they have to Vamp for a little bit of

2704
02:05:23,840 --> 02:05:25,120
Remember music start

2705
02:05:25,888 --> 02:05:28,704
Because what ends up happening is

2706
02:05:29,472 --> 02:05:30,752
It could not be more perfect

2707
02:05:31,520 --> 02:05:32,800
I think that this sums up a

2708
02:05:34,080 --> 02:05:35,872
Well you're disappointed in the Supreme Court

2709
02:05:36,128 --> 02:05:37,152
Pacific yesterday

2710
02:05:37,664 --> 02:05:39,456
Call Perico

2711
02:05:41,248 --> 02:05:42,528

Who is Bill out here we still live talk 2020 on the game

2713
02:05:51,488 --> 02:05:52,768

Godzilla

2715
02:05:56,352 --> 02:05:57,632

2728
02:07:20,832 --> 02:07:22,112
Northern things I found religion

2729
02:07:22,368 --> 02:07:25,440
Choose if you watch this video there's a guy who looks like Napoleon Dynamite

2730
02:07:25,696 --> 02:07:26,720
Fight on stage

2731
02:07:26,976 --> 02:07:30,816
I don't know what this dude is doing I can't tell if he's

2732
02:07:31,328 --> 02:07:34,144
With them and they're as a visual joke

2733
02:07:34,656 --> 02:07:36,192
He's dancing along with them

2734
02:07:36,448 --> 02:07:42,592
Or whatever or if he is like from some other Outlet

2735
02:07:42,848 --> 02:07:43,872
I have no idea what's going on

2736
02:07:44,128 --> 02:07:50,272
It's bewildering modern Forrest Gump movie about that guy twenty years from now and he's going to be everywhere

2737
02:07:50,528 --> 02:07:51,040
Outrage

2738
02:07:51,296 --> 02:07:52,576
He will have inserted himself into

2739
02:07:52,832 --> 02:07:53,600
The Vietnam War

2740
02:07:53,856 --> 02:07:55,136
I can't tell you how

2741
02:07:55,904 --> 02:08:00,256
Weird what like obviously we're recording this on Sunday and this is all happening on Saturday

2742
02:08:00,512 --> 02:08:05,120
Order to make this really work at ended up like I really late night last night

2743
02:08:05,632 --> 02:08:06,400
And so I'm like

2744
02:08:06,656 --> 02:08:07,168
Yo

2745
02:08:07,424 --> 02:08:08,704
Late into the evening

2746
02:08:08,960 --> 02:08:10,240
Watching these bananas

2747
02:08:10,496 --> 02:08:13,568
Speeches

2748
02:08:14,080 --> 02:08:16,640
We must chant Jesus Dave

2749
02:08:16,896 --> 02:08:19,456
And then a wrap got their break it out

2750
02:08:21,504 --> 02:08:25,344
Yeah and the fact that the broadcast goes straight to a my pillow commercial

2751
02:08:25,600 --> 02:08:26,112
In the middle of

2752
02:08:26,368 --> 02:08:31,232
Maybe the most energetic thing they had on their stage

2753
02:08:31,488 --> 02:08:35,328
It just was kind of disrespectful to this very serviceable rapper

2754
02:08:37,632 --> 02:08:38,400
Jesus Christ

2755
02:08:39,168 --> 02:08:39,680
Indeed

2756
02:08:39,936 --> 02:08:42,496
That has got to be the most surreal night

2757
02:08:42,752 --> 02:08:43,776
I can pick up like

2758
02:08:44,288 --> 02:08:44,800
To go

2759
02:08:46,336 --> 02:08:49,664
Just to ride that all the way through till like 3

2760
02:08:50,944 --> 02:08:52,224
If you were just watching One rally

2761
02:08:52,736 --> 02:08:53,248
No big deal

2762
02:08:54,784 --> 02:08:55,808
That's what you you listen to

2763
02:08:56,576 --> 02:08:59,136
But you're watching

2764
02:08:59,392 --> 02:09:00,928
7 straight hours of Rally's

2765
02:09:01,440 --> 02:09:01,952
At least

2766
02:09:02,208 --> 02:09:03,744
7 straight hours of Rally's

2767
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:08,096
Is on after a long day into the wee hours of the morning

2768
02:09:08,352 --> 02:09:09,120
And that assert

2769
02:09:09,376 --> 02:09:09,888
Certain points

2770
02:09:10,144 --> 02:09:13,216
Didn't you have to just have a complete break from reality

2771
02:09:13,472 --> 02:09:16,544
I kind of did think at a certain point I was making up

2772
02:09:16,800 --> 02:09:22,176
What was that must have been that's how I would feel if you're telling me this happened it was so real

2773
02:09:22,432 --> 02:09:24,480
I can't imagine experiencing it by myself

2774
02:09:24,736 --> 02:09:29,344
Do you know what I mean yeah. There were a couple points where I thought like

2775
02:09:30,112 --> 02:09:30,880
This is

2776
02:09:31,136 --> 02:09:31,904
Self-parody

2777
02:09:32,928 --> 02:09:34,464
No way

2778
02:09:34,720 --> 02:09:37,792
Twin speech started with a my pillow ad

2779
02:09:38,048 --> 02:09:40,864
Why is this guy giving out my pillow code

2780
02:09:41,120 --> 02:09:43,680
Can't beat this is nonsense cannot be

2781
02:09:44,960 --> 02:09:45,472
It's so

2782
02:09:46,752 --> 02:09:47,264
Tough

2783
02:09:47,520 --> 02:09:48,800
So like really put

2784
02:09:49,056 --> 02:09:50,848
Your hands on what this is

2785
02:09:51,104 --> 02:09:51,616
Because

2786
02:09:52,640 --> 02:09:54,432
It's simultaneously

2787
02:09:54,688 --> 02:09:55,200
Terrifying

2788
02:09:55,712 --> 02:09:56,224
Display

2789
02:09:56,480 --> 02:09:56,992
Of

2790
02:09:57,248 --> 02:09:59,040
Different levels of

2791
02:09:59,552 --> 02:10:00,320
Explicitness

2792
02:10:00,576 --> 02:10:01,856
I'm about a desire to live in

2793
02:10:02,112 --> 02:10:02,880
Christian theocracy

2794
02:10:03,648 --> 02:10:05,440
You know that's not about

2795
02:10:06,720 --> 02:10:09,536
Standing up for your right we be able to practice

2796
02:10:09,792 --> 02:10:10,560
Your religion

2797
02:10:10,816 --> 02:10:13,888
It's about enforcing your religious beliefs onto the government

2798
02:10:14,144 --> 02:10:17,984
Yep making the government adhere to your religious beliefs at the expense of

2799
02:10:18,240 --> 02:10:19,008
Everyone else

2800
02:10:19,264 --> 02:10:20,288
Who does not share your beliefs

2801
02:10:20,544 --> 02:10:21,824
And that's terrifying

2802
02:10:22,080 --> 02:10:23,360
Horrify cuz you have

2803
02:10:23,616 --> 02:10:26,432
D'you know the Jericho March

2804
02:10:26,688 --> 02:10:27,200
Maybe

2805
02:10:27,712 --> 02:10:29,248
You know obviously more

2806
02:10:30,272 --> 02:10:30,784
Upfront about

2807
02:10:31,040 --> 02:10:32,064
It's called the Jericho

2808
02:10:32,320 --> 02:10:32,832
Call Bia

2809
02:10:33,856 --> 02:10:37,440
Cher's overlap in funding and speakers with the same other Mart

2810
02:10:37,696 --> 02:10:38,720
Quite honestly

2811
02:10:39,232 --> 02:10:41,536
I think the two people that I heard

2812
02:10:41,792 --> 02:10:42,816
The other March

2813
02:10:43,072 --> 02:10:43,840
Do women for Trump

2814
02:10:44,096 --> 02:10:45,120
Women for America first

2815
02:10:45,632 --> 02:10:46,656
There was born

2816
02:10:46,912 --> 02:10:49,472
Christian nationalism probably on display there

2817
02:10:49,984 --> 02:10:52,032
Not granted they didn't have someone like Leon bunch

2818
02:10:52,288 --> 02:10:55,104
We got to kill the devil so our kids don't have wings

2819
02:10:55,360 --> 02:10:59,968
There was a little bit more speak freely going on over there

2820
02:11:01,504 --> 02:11:05,088
I think I'm more scared of the women for America First rally honestly

2821
02:11:06,112 --> 02:11:08,672
Smart enough to not allow Alex there

2822
02:11:09,440 --> 02:11:10,720
It's it's about Gorka

2823
02:11:10,976 --> 02:11:11,744
It's fascism package

2824
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:12,768
Buy Coca-Cola

2825
02:11:13,024 --> 02:11:13,792
Like it is

2826
02:11:14,048 --> 02:11:15,328
It is so my my pillow

2827
02:11:15,584 --> 02:11:17,120
Invalid

2828
02:11:17,376 --> 02:11:17,888
That liked

2829
02:11:18,144 --> 02:11:19,168
Tying together of

2830
02:11:19,936 --> 02:11:20,448
Just

2831
02:11:20,704 --> 02:11:21,216
Bass

2832
02:11:21,984 --> 02:11:22,752
Space Commerce

2833
02:11:23,264 --> 02:11:24,800
Just f******

2834
02:11:25,568 --> 02:11:27,616
Promo code level Commerce

2835
02:11:28,384 --> 02:11:28,896
With

2836
02:11:29,664 --> 02:11:32,992
Your ostensible belief system which we all know is

2837
02:11:33,248 --> 02:11:33,760
Complete Bowl

2838
02:11:34,016 --> 02:11:38,112
If if you if you think anything that those rallies had to do

2839
02:11:38,368 --> 02:11:40,416
Those rallies had zero to do with Christianity

2840
02:11:40,928 --> 02:11:41,952
I agree

2841
02:11:42,464 --> 02:11:42,976
0

2842
02:11:43,232 --> 02:11:43,744
It's a mass

2843
02:11:44,256 --> 02:11:44,768
It's being worn

2844
02:11:45,024 --> 02:11:46,560
100%

2845
02:11:47,072 --> 02:11:51,680
Julie difficult is that like I don't I'm not saying that of everybody who's in the crowd

2846
02:11:51,936 --> 02:11:53,728
Again like I think there's probably

2847
02:11:53,984 --> 02:11:54,752
Maybe some

2848
02:11:55,520 --> 02:11:56,800
Sincere in mislead

2849
02:11:57,056 --> 02:11:57,824
People who were there

2850
02:11:58,080 --> 02:11:58,848
I don't know

2851
02:11:59,104 --> 02:12:00,640
I can't I can't say

2852
02:12:00,896 --> 02:12:01,664
But I don't

2853
02:12:04,480 --> 02:12:06,016
Can't imagine that the people who are

2854
02:12:06,272 --> 02:12:07,040
Putting this on

2855
02:12:07,296 --> 02:12:10,624
Are motivated by a sincere spirituality

2856
02:12:10,880 --> 02:12:11,392
Absolutely not

2857
02:12:11,648 --> 02:12:15,488
It's very difficult for me to accept that and maybe it feels that way.

2858
02:12:15,744 --> 02:12:19,328
I'm not sure it's very difficult to judge I wrestle with

2859
02:12:19,584 --> 02:12:21,120
Because it's something that's so intimate

2860
02:12:21,376 --> 02:12:23,424
A personal within someone

2861
02:12:23,680 --> 02:12:24,960
Like True Religion

2862
02:12:25,216 --> 02:12:25,728
Just feeling

2863
02:12:26,240 --> 02:12:28,032
And it is whenever you served

2864
02:12:28,288 --> 02:12:29,056
Criticize somebody

2865
02:12:29,568 --> 02:12:32,128
About their sincerity or lack thereof

2866
02:12:32,640 --> 02:12:33,920
It kind of comes off as if

2867
02:12:34,176 --> 02:12:35,968
Oh you think you have

2868
02:12:36,224 --> 02:12:37,248
Sincere belief

2869
02:12:37,504 --> 02:12:40,576
No I don't I don't want to get into that kind of an argument

2870
02:12:40,832 --> 02:12:41,600
This is gross

2871
02:12:41,856 --> 02:12:42,880
Here's a here's the one I would

2872
02:12:43,136 --> 02:12:43,904
About

2873
02:12:45,696 --> 02:12:47,232
If your beliefs

2874
02:12:47,488 --> 02:12:50,304
Stars sincere and a looking

2875
02:12:50,560 --> 02:12:51,840
Christ and all that stuff

2876
02:12:53,376 --> 02:12:54,912
Go read the way of the

2877
02:12:55,424 --> 02:12:55,936
Andrea Lee

2878
02:12:56,192 --> 02:12:56,960
Really like

2879
02:12:57,472 --> 02:13:03,104
Meditate on Cecil onan's and the idea of praying everyday and every moment and what that actually mean

2880
02:13:04,640 --> 02:13:05,408
Or

2881
02:13:05,920 --> 02:13:08,480
You could go to a rally and try and overthrow nation and kill the bugs

2882
02:13:09,248 --> 02:13:15,392
Yeah in the difficulty that I have is the combination of both of these rallies being so

2883
02:13:15,648 --> 02:13:17,696
Explicitly my Christian nationalist

2884
02:13:17,952 --> 02:13:18,464
Austin character

2885
02:13:18,976 --> 02:13:20,256
I'm so

2886
02:13:20,512 --> 02:13:21,536
Overt about it

2887
02:13:22,048 --> 02:13:23,072
And both of them

2888
02:13:23,328 --> 02:13:23,840
Being

2889
02:13:24,096 --> 02:13:24,864
So

2890
02:13:25,120 --> 02:13:26,144
Crass

2891
02:13:27,168 --> 02:13:32,032
Joe Ciara we're laughing our asses off at all the MyPillow stuff but like

2892
02:13:32,288 --> 02:13:33,056
Both of these rats

2893
02:13:33,312 --> 02:13:34,848
Both of them

2894
02:13:35,104 --> 02:13:38,432
So f***** the parity level of the

2895
02:13:38,944 --> 02:13:39,456
Like

2896
02:13:39,712 --> 02:13:41,504
Praying and chanting Jesus

2897
02:13:41,760 --> 02:13:44,576
Into a drunk guy introducing a rap Act

2898
02:13:44,832 --> 02:13:46,880
Just ridiculous or it's surreal

2899
02:13:47,648 --> 02:13:48,160
And

2900
02:13:48,416 --> 02:13:50,208
I don't know what to do with it

2901
02:13:50,464 --> 02:13:51,488
But I do think

2902
02:13:52,768 --> 02:13:54,304
Alex Jones got a lot of headlines

2903
02:13:54,560 --> 02:13:55,840
Out of crashing van

2904
02:13:56,352 --> 02:13:57,120
Jericho March

2905
02:13:57,632 --> 02:14:01,216
Wants and so it does come into our view and I think that one of the things

2906
02:14:01,472 --> 02:14:01,984
Games with important

2907
02:14:02,240 --> 02:14:03,264
I thought I guess

2908
02:14:03,520 --> 02:14:06,848
Is to take what we know about Alex and what we understand about that

2909
02:14:07,104 --> 02:14:07,616
And Glenn

2910
02:14:07,872 --> 02:14:09,664
The external World a little bit

2911
02:14:09,920 --> 02:14:10,688
When there is a chance

2912
02:14:12,736 --> 02:14:13,248
Quite honest

2913
02:14:14,528 --> 02:14:15,040
Looking at

2914
02:14:15,296 --> 02:14:18,112
These people some of whom I'm aware of some of whom I'm not

2915
02:14:18,368 --> 02:14:21,184
Who are chosen by the people who are organizing these rallies

2916
02:14:21,440 --> 02:14:21,952
Skippy's beaches

2917
02:14:22,976 --> 02:14:23,744
I don't see a lot of the

2918
02:14:24,256 --> 02:14:26,816
Between what they're putting out there and what Alex

2919
02:14:27,072 --> 02:14:28,608
Nope and that is not

2920
02:14:28,864 --> 02:14:29,376
How I felt

2921
02:14:29,632 --> 02:14:30,144
Even

2922
02:14:30,400 --> 02:14:33,472
Like even when we look back at like 2009

2923
02:14:33,728 --> 02:14:35,520
Like even when the tea party was going on

2924
02:14:35,776 --> 02:14:37,824
There were still substantiv differences

2925
02:14:38,080 --> 02:14:38,592
Between

2926
02:14:38,848 --> 02:14:42,432
The Tea Party and Alex Jones Alex was more severe

2927
02:14:42,688 --> 02:14:44,480
You may be more severe than some of these

2928
02:14:44,736 --> 02:14:45,504
These people and more

2929
02:14:45,760 --> 02:14:46,528
Extreme but like

2930
02:14:47,808 --> 02:14:49,088
These rallies

2931
02:14:49,344 --> 02:14:50,368
I don't understand

2932
02:14:50,624 --> 02:14:52,416
Why except for bad press

2933
02:14:53,184 --> 02:14:53,696
They would

2934
02:14:53,952 --> 02:14:57,024
Not let Alex speakerphone

2935
02:14:57,536 --> 02:14:58,560
I don't get why they have to

2936
02:14:59,072 --> 02:15:01,376
Parade around even at the Jericho March

2937
02:15:04,448 --> 02:15:05,984
Spirit of inclusion

2938
02:15:07,520 --> 02:15:10,080
Go f*** yourself he's right on board exactly what you're

2939
02:15:10,336 --> 02:15:14,432
He's doing what you're doing better yeah the idea that they are still allowed

2940
02:15:14,688 --> 02:15:15,200
2

2941
02:15:16,224 --> 02:15:16,736
Like

2942
02:15:16,992 --> 02:15:18,016
That was Alex's roll

2943
02:15:18,272 --> 02:15:21,088
4 Fox News in and Rush Limbaugh's in the Glenn Baxter

2944
02:15:21,344 --> 02:15:22,112
Is for them to be like hey

2945
02:15:22,624 --> 02:15:24,672
At least we're not like Alex Jones right

2946
02:15:24,928 --> 02:15:27,232
They're all like that and they're still trying to act

2947
02:15:27,488 --> 02:15:31,072
It's like by saying hey at least we're not Alex Jones Infowars

2948
02:15:31,328 --> 02:15:32,864
We still get a we still get that

2949
02:15:33,120 --> 02:15:34,912
Difference you're not there's no effort

2950
02:15:36,704 --> 02:15:42,848
It well I made you act like you're too good for Alex

2951
02:15:43,104 --> 02:15:45,920
Don't feel that way.

2952
02:15:46,176 --> 02:15:46,944
I think that

2953
02:15:47,200 --> 02:15:47,712
You know I can

2954
02:15:47,968 --> 02:15:49,248
Can see where that thought

2955
02:15:49,504 --> 02:15:52,576
What comes from a largely comes from the

2956
02:15:52,832 --> 02:15:55,136
Reality that if you watch that rally

2957
02:15:55,648 --> 02:15:56,416
You'll see

2958
02:15:56,672 --> 02:15:57,952
A difference incompetent

2959
02:15:58,208 --> 02:16:01,024
From Alex and the rest of the speakers

2960
02:16:01,280 --> 02:16:04,352
If the if the goal is to rile Up This Crowd

2961
02:16:04,864 --> 02:16:09,472
Goddamnit does Alex do a better job than any of the rest of them you know she went in that point when he's like

2962
02:16:09,728 --> 02:16:10,496
Getting

2963
02:16:10,752 --> 02:16:11,776
Not allowed

2964
02:16:19,712 --> 02:16:21,760
And that's how you f****** do it

2965
02:16:22,016 --> 02:16:24,576
Do all this better than all of you but

2966
02:16:24,832 --> 02:16:26,624
Unfortunately as brand is so toxic that

2967
02:16:27,136 --> 02:16:31,488
No one even Ali Alexander 100

2968
02:16:31,744 --> 02:16:33,792
So I mean it's kind of like

2969
02:16:34,560 --> 02:16:35,072
I don't know

2970
02:16:35,328 --> 02:16:37,120
I think that this kind of sums up

2971
02:16:37,376 --> 02:16:38,912
What I think is one of the main

2972
02:16:39,168 --> 02:16:39,680
Problems

2973
02:16:41,728 --> 02:16:42,240
Fact checker

2974
02:16:44,800 --> 02:16:45,824
Haven't you had it with these

2975
02:16:47,616 --> 02:16:52,480
That could almost be the big problem probably a better way of putting it

2976
02:16:52,736 --> 02:16:54,016
I think when you cheer for

2977
02:16:54,272 --> 02:16:57,088
F*** fact-checkers who's up with all this reality

2978
02:16:57,344 --> 02:17:03,488
Who's who's up there with Dreamworld

2979
02:17:03,744 --> 02:17:04,768
Dreamworld

2980
02:17:05,024 --> 02:17:05,792
Boo

2981
02:17:06,048 --> 02:17:06,816
Who likes

2982
02:17:07,072 --> 02:17:07,840
To confirm things

2983
02:17:10,912 --> 02:17:11,680
Read a book

2984
02:17:11,936 --> 02:17:16,032
The mind is the fear killer

2985
02:17:16,800 --> 02:17:18,592
Yeah I am

2986
02:17:19,104 --> 02:17:20,384
I thought this was an interesting

2987
02:17:20,640 --> 02:17:22,176
Exploration little bit sort of

2988
02:17:23,200 --> 02:17:27,040
Fully outside of around Butler to the side of it a tire patch

2989
02:17:27,552 --> 02:17:30,112
Republic out more than usual

2990
02:17:30,368 --> 02:17:31,648
Just because it's like oh

2991
02:17:32,928 --> 02:17:33,952
All these people

2992
02:17:34,976 --> 02:17:35,488
Chanting

2993
02:17:35,744 --> 02:17:36,256
And cheering

2994
02:17:37,024 --> 02:17:39,328
And all these speakers sounded very similar to Alex

2995
02:17:39,840 --> 02:17:42,400
It's not it's a bummer and I think we have a very large problem

2996
02:17:42,656 --> 02:17:44,960
In front of us that I do not know how to deal with

2997
02:17:45,728 --> 02:17:46,752
And I think that

2998
02:17:48,032 --> 02:17:49,824
I think that it's important to recognize

2999
02:17:51,104 --> 02:17:52,640
One of the major problems is

3000
02:17:52,896 --> 02:17:53,920
The blurring here

3001
02:17:54,432 --> 02:17:55,456
This is not

3002
02:17:55,968 --> 02:17:56,736
This isn't about Paula

3003
02:17:57,248 --> 02:17:58,528
Is it not about policies

3004
02:17:59,040 --> 02:17:59,552
This is

3005
02:17:59,808 --> 02:18:01,344
This is something else altogether

3006
02:18:01,856 --> 02:18:02,624
And trying to approach it

3007
02:18:02,880 --> 02:18:04,160
From the standpoint of

3008
02:18:04,672 --> 02:18:05,696
Arguing or Pilot

3009
02:18:05,952 --> 02:18:06,976
It's not going to work

3010
02:18:07,744 --> 02:18:09,024
It's absolutely not going to work

3011
02:18:09,536 --> 02:18:10,048
Here's my pitch

3012
02:18:10,560 --> 02:18:11,584
All right now

3013
02:18:12,864 --> 02:18:15,168
I think one of the speakers Did point out

3014
02:18:15,424 --> 02:18:15,936
What's that

3015
02:18:16,192 --> 02:18:18,240
The nation was created

3016
02:18:18,496 --> 02:18:20,288
And now he said it was created by God

3017
02:18:20,800 --> 02:18:22,848
And I would argue that it was

3018
02:18:23,104 --> 02:18:24,640
Was created because

3019
02:18:24,896 --> 02:18:25,664
King George

3020
02:18:26,432 --> 02:18:28,224
And his elk

3021
02:18:28,480 --> 02:18:29,760
All right but

3022
02:18:30,272 --> 02:18:30,784
But

3023
02:18:31,040 --> 02:18:33,856
Maybe we should learn something from King George

3024
02:18:34,368 --> 02:18:34,880
Send

3025
02:18:35,392 --> 02:18:41,536
Okay well I almost already dispute your premise cuz I hate faction what did King George Do What did the

3026
02:18:41,792 --> 02:18:43,328
Can do when faced with a Puritan

3027
02:18:43,584 --> 02:18:45,632
You know they were causing a ruckus

3028
02:18:46,144 --> 02:18:47,168
And then he was like

3029
02:18:48,192 --> 02:18:49,216
Get the f*** out

3030
02:18:49,984 --> 02:18:50,752
And then they all left

3031
02:18:51,264 --> 02:18:53,312
Yeah I know that we shoot them to the Moon

3032
02:18:53,824 --> 02:18:56,640
This seems too much like those mentalities

3033
02:18:56,896 --> 02:18:57,664
I find kind of

3034
02:18:58,176 --> 02:19:03,552
Noxious which are the elected

3035
02:19:03,808 --> 02:19:07,648
It sounds so much like the you know you hear this rhetoric from people

3036
02:19:07,904 --> 02:19:08,672
Do you do like

3037
02:19:08,928 --> 02:19:10,208
Trump being the president get out

3038
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:12,768
I just don't think

3039
02:19:13,536 --> 02:19:14,304
A good solution either

3040
02:19:14,816 --> 02:19:15,584
I don't know

3041
02:19:15,840 --> 02:19:16,352
I don't know

3042
02:19:16,608 --> 02:19:17,120
It's a

3043
02:19:17,376 --> 02:19:18,656
It's a tough time to be in the middle of

3044
02:19:19,168 --> 02:19:20,448
I don't really know

3045
02:19:20,960 --> 02:19:21,728
How the ball breaks

3046
02:19:21,984 --> 02:19:25,056
Spell steadfast

3047
02:19:25,568 --> 02:19:26,592
No I would agree with that

3048
02:19:26,848 --> 02:19:30,688
Kicking people out last time

3049
02:19:30,944 --> 02:19:32,224
No

3050
02:19:32,992 --> 02:19:35,296
Violence doesn't work but I don't doesn't do it

3051
02:19:36,064 --> 02:19:38,368
Maybe we should try using like those

3052
02:19:39,392 --> 02:19:45,536
So it's like 2020 right and that means that another couple weeks before

3053
02:19:45,792 --> 02:19:46,560
Like a bunch of years

3054
02:19:47,328 --> 02:19:48,096
And humans

3055
02:19:48,864 --> 02:19:49,632
And they probably

3056
02:19:49,888 --> 02:19:50,656
Dealt with some s*** like this

3057
02:19:50,912 --> 02:19:51,424
This before

3058
02:19:51,936 --> 02:19:52,960
We should probably try smart

3059
02:19:53,472 --> 02:19:56,032
Well I wish that I had this clip cuz I actually

3060
02:19:56,288 --> 02:19:56,800
Really

3061
02:19:57,056 --> 02:19:57,568
Great

3062
02:19:57,824 --> 02:19:58,336

Michael Flynn you might hurt him

3064
02:20:02,944 --> 02:20:03,712
This is never happened

3065
02:20:04,224 --> 02:20:10,368
Human history before it's never actually we can't learn anything from history

3066
02:20:10,624 --> 02:20:16,512
Really convenient how we can't know anything about this cuz it's never happened before Italy

3067
02:20:16,768 --> 02:20:22,144
All those book learning idiot

3068
02:20:23,936 --> 02:20:25,728
God dammit I got so I don't I don't know

3069
