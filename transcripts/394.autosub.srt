63
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:06,784
Man's feelings on Missouri football team

The present day

65
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:15,744
Because I just can't not I can't not

66
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,815
I can't do anything you just can't quit the the present

67
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:21,119
Things just keep happening

68
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:24,447
Keep liquor events happen

69
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:26,495
We're in the middle of

70
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:27,775
Absolute chaos

71
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:31,871
Things that are geopolitical irrelevant

72
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:34,431
We're going over January 31st

73
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:36,735
2020 Undead this is 20/20

74
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,527
A house

75
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,599
In the surrounding

76
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:43,135
Context of this

77
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:48,511
A day will be one of the the Senate votes on whether or not to have Whitney

78
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,303

00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,863
You've got that's the day of brexit

80
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,143
Right

81
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:58,751
Have the coronavirus situation still looming in the minds of

82
00:04:59,007 --> 00:04:59,775
Propagandist

83
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:00,543
A etheric

84
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:04,639
And we're going to talk about Wolfgang halbig

85
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:06,943
Just a couple episodes but I have not heard

86
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,759
Even come up

87
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:12,575
Not been mentioned in the time that I've been listening

88
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:15,391
Timer things

89
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,927
Anza

90
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:22,047
Happy we got the Iowa caucuses on Monday

91
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,839
Everything is

92
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:26,655
In play

93
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,703
And are coming military dictator

94
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,471
Is going to be great

95
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:30,495
So I've been like

96
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:33,823
You know listening to other things trying to find episodes that might be

97
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,359
Interesting to go over but I

98
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,639
I just feel like if we don't

99
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:37,919
Stick around in the present

100
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:39,455
We run the risk of

101
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,223
Missing

102
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:40,991
Something

103
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,527
So I I've just

104
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:46,367
Committed myself to the fact that like we've got to be in the present for

105
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,903
A while probably

106
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:51,743
And I'm going to do my best to make it fun as we go along

107
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:56,351
In much the same way we got to hear Alex Jones interview a baby

108
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,631
On a recent show

109
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,679
This episode does include

110
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:02,495
Jones doing one of my favorites big Bragg's

111
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,031
He's ever done

112
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:06,847
Something a little little brag about his past

113
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,127
That I cannot

114
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:14,527
Believe is true in any way and it makes me it makes me giggle

115
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:16,831
A dog's life

116
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,623

00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,719

On this January 31st

154
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:34,047
Well the United Nations is working with the globalist client state of China to stand

155
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:39,679
Size worldwide martial-law policies

156
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,751
I've never seen

00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,287
Descale

158
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:45,567

00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,615

161
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,687
In terms of all of the

162
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:53,247
All of the different

163
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,063
Tremendous support

164
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,855
According to Wuhan and who by

165
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:03,231
Highly organized emergency management structure

166
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,535
Challenges with the response

167
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,303
Husband

168
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:09,375
The Chinese government deserves huge credit

169
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,447
Transparent sandwich

170
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,359
Pictures of infection

171
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,919
Working with Germany to investigate

172
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:22,687
Is it was

173
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:23,711
The lab in China

174
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:24,735
Contact

175
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:26,527
To tell them that they had to return

176
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,343
Not only helping

177
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,623
To manage

178
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,415
Cases and its own country but it is

179
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:35,743
And it just goes on

180
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:38,559
Alexplayz B

181
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:39,839
I don't know

182
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:45,215
He's playing the clip to demonstrate like it's something nefarious but it's nothing close

183
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:49,823
I recognize the voice he's playing because I happened to watch that conference

184
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,359
He's playing a clip

185
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:53,919
I want to sing that the UN is working with

186
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:56,479
The Chinese government but this is actually World Health org

187
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:57,247
Is a Chicano

188
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:00,831
And In fairness to WHIO is a branch of the UN with the

189
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,111
It still feels a little bit sloppy

190
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:04,927
Shrimp

191
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:10,303
Also of course the World Health Organization is working with China on this outbreak

192
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,863
Why is that

193
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:15,935
What is Alex expect I'm just to be like I will wing it

194
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:16,703
F*** it

195
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:18,751
The part that Alex plays there

196
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:22,079
Is This World Health Organization representative talking about how quickly

197
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,359
The Chinese government record

198
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,127
Recognize the virus

199
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:26,175
Identified it found its genome

200
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:28,991
And share the genome with the rest of the world so people could

201
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,271
Identify it if it

202
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,039
Pops up in there

203
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:31,807
Region

204
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:35,903
Of all the things in this whole story I don't know how information-sharing

205
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:41,023
Alex is taking issue with that seems to be the lead

206
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:45,887
One degree of separation away from standardizing Global martial law tan

207
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:51,007
Everybody knows that it's wild that that's like the angle that he's starting this this whole thing off on

208
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:53,823
Cuz it's week

209
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:59,967
One thing that everybody is kind of universally praising China for in order to demonize

210
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:02,527
Yeah it's strange that's a little bit

211
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:06,367
This is just a little bit of like a little nibble on a moose Bouche

212
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,647
At the beginning of the show

213
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:09,183
Complaining about the virus

214
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:09,951
Outbreak

215
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:11,487
Marshall

216
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:13,791
Alex gets distracted cuz one of his

217
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:16,351
Interns play the little prank on it I think

218
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,655
That's what I was telling folks about

219
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,703
Coming in here and seeing this incredibly

220
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:24,031
When during the show

221
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:30,431
So what's happened is one of the triggering image somebody is put up on his big-screen a picture of Adam Schiff

222
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,711
Haha

223
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:34,271
Cannot stand the sight of Adam Schiff

224
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:37,599
So he is sort of losing it a little bit any Italy

225
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:41,183
You heard right there he's like the break we're just going to

226
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:41,951
Start the show

227
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,743
That's what I was telling folks about

228
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:46,047
Coming in here and seeing this incredibly

229
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:52,447
When do the show next segment

230
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,727
Never even existed

231
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:58,335
Aw of that problem is I get into your last-minute right before

232
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:00,127
So I got here

233
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,943
About 30 seconds late to apologize the crew on that

234
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:09,087
Reset here not just blow up and turn this freaking table over man because

235
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:11,135
Stop going on this world

236
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,415
Like I said

237
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:14,463
That son-of-a-b****

238
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:16,255
We off

239
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,559
I probably shouldn't have that up there

240
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:25,215
What the hell is wrong with that

241
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:37,247
I really like you just freaking he can't handle

242
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,527
The sight of this guy

243
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:42,111
That seems excessive Alex Jones

244
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:42,879
For three years

245
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,159
Lowe's

246
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:46,719
I can handle seeing a picture of him

247
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:49,791
The president is one of the most

248
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:55,679
Evil people I've ever encountered in my entire life in the present

249
00:12:55,935 --> 00:13:02,079
A picture of

250
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:04,639
It's very weird pics

251
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,663
F****** worked up about

252
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,455
Sing this picture

253
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:12,575
Who I am

254
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,879
This is the people do they see a picture of Adam Schiff

255
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:15,903
And that they

256
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:19,231
I really have to go over the top doing the performance

257
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:20,255
It's Abby really Furious

258
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,559
I'm not positive

259
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:24,351
Performance

260
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:27,167
Some sort of like Rio on

261
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,703
Regulated emotion

262
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:32,031
But he has yeah when he sees people that he doesn't like just this

263
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,311
Is overarching

264
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,359
Uncontrollable rage

265
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:39,967
Seems like he could have used a trigger warning

266
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:46,367
Has railed against but it seems like somebody should have said that

267
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:51,487
Don't put up images that trigger made does chi sound like

268
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:54,303
Uncle freak out

269
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:59,167
Have to restart the show which isn't the thing that can be done with live broadcast

270
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:02,751
Okay just everybody hates it's like when you're

271
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:07,103
When they introduced evidence that the judges liked disregard Stephanie

272
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:09,151
Right so he eat this again

273
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,711
Be clear this is not part of

274
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:14,271
Absolutely

275
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,551
This is this is

276
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:19,391
Stricken from the record

277
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:31,167
Look like a pedophile

278
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:33,471
He is one of the democratic

279
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,031
All the tea in China

280
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,567
The dad guy is a

281
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,335
Pedophile

282
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:41,919
I will take that bathroom someone is pedophile

283
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:44,735
In a movie there's only one person that

284
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:51,903
And the Popstar is pedophile Young

285
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,463
Shelter or Schiff

286
00:14:55,231 --> 00:15:00,351
Because when you really get down to it really feel like this is illegal

287
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:04,447
Make your skin crawl pieces

288
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:10,847
What are children

289
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:18,015
I told you I'm going to come back this is not

290
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:20,063
Arsenal screw-ups

291
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:25,439
Boy

292
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,975
Play

293
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:29,279
What a baby

294
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:32,863
We're really getting to the point where it's like somebody needs to confine this may

295
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:35,423
I really think you can't do that

296
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:38,239
No because I think he's using such

297
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,543
Vicky's walking the line

298
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:46,943
In terms of defamation gangrape of the country

299
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,527
That's not actionable

300
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,319
It's like a pedophile is a judge

301
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,855
That's not something

302
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,135
Laboratory

303
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,671
But also

304
00:15:56,927 --> 00:16:00,255
Brian stelter he has cold he did directly call him

305
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:03,327
You did say he's a pedophile

306
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,119
He said he wouldn't be surprised

307
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,143
You did also call him

308
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:10,495
Yeah it's not good I don't I don't know what you'd have to do

309
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:12,031
Publix

310
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:14,591
Be difficult

311
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:17,151
Briarwood be difficult I still feel like

312
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:19,967
You can't directly go on the radio and say

313
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:20,991
Certainly

314
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,295
That Adam Schiff is a pedophile

315
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,855
That was not part

316
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:32,767
Hello.

317
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:37,631
I don't know if I ever heard it episode where Alex is like doing right now

318
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:40,959
What you just heard

319
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:43,519
Not really taking a mulligan on this Earth

320
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:49,663
I love it also if you're casting a movie

321
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:55,551
I would say the Brian stelter and Adam Schiff are both not in the in the running

322
00:16:55,807 --> 00:17:00,159
I think they would be perfectly cast Boaz both Brian stelter and Adam Schiff

323
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:02,463
In a movie who needs somebody play Brian stelter

324
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,487
I recommend

325
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:06,815
Sorry your brain filter right away Doug test

326
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:09,631
Navigate to be actual show cuz I wasn't

327
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,423
Alex

328
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,191
Comes in

329
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:13,983
And apparently

330
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,007
CNN

331
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,287
The problem with

332
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,055
White people

333
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:20,127
Trying to stop the Coronavirus

334
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:26,271
Article with their tweets

335
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:34,207
White people are trying to stop the coronavirus spreading

336
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:35,999
White people's fault

337
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:41,119
So the article an Infowars unsurprisingly was Paul Joseph Watson

338
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,679
Found a CNN tweet to complain about

339
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:46,239
Between is about how the pictures that Trump

340
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:52,639
Tweeted out where he was being briefed about the coronavirus situation by a panel of experts was legitimately all white men

341
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:55,967
With one white woman appearing to be at the meeting in the background

342
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:58,783
The CNN tweet links to an opinion

343
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,343
He's on CNN about how striking this image

344
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:03,647
How commonplace it's become in Trump's Administration

345
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:06,719
Ministration to only see why people in positions of authority

346
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:08,767
Or even close to power or official.

347
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:09,791
What

348
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:16,191
No one else did anybody see that coming no one is mad that they were trying to work on the virus situation it's just a notch

349
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:19,007
It's pointing out how Trump tweeted this picture along with

350
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:21,055
The caption calling them quote the world's best

351
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,335
Best the best

352
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,871
Expert anywhere in the world

353
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,431
As the article expresses quote

354
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,967
The recent photos of the best

355
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:32,319
Experts Telegraph the kinds of people the administration Deeds worthy of holding power

356
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,855
Or even being in close proximity

357
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:34,623
Somebody to it

358
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,159
The article ends

359
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,207
Quote the visuals that have come to

360
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:40,511
To find the Trump Administration say something else

361
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:44,863
They signal which people in a multiracial half female country

362
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,655
Trump values the opinions of

363
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:51,007
Mostly white men who are mirror images of the president

364
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:51,775
Himself

365
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:55,103
Paul takes his pretty short op-ed on CNN

366
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:59,967
And which mirrors points of people that made pretty consistently about Trump's Administration going all the way back

367
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:00,735
Today 1

368
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,527
And this is how he comments on it

369
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:03,807
This is from the article

370
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,367
According to CNN

371
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:08,671
The real concern about the coronavirus is not the

372
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,695
Potential for a global

373
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:10,719
Pandemic

374
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:13,279
The fact there are too many white people trying to stop it

375
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:17,631
Does not accurate at all but that isn't the point

376
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:22,751
Intention I think that might be a little off I don't think his analysis is correct

377
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:24,799
He says later in his Beast quote

378
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,335
Apparently wanting to

379
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,359
To not a racist

380
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,383
This is more important

381
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:30,431
Stopping the rapidly spreading global

382
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:32,735
Pandemic has not reached at least 23 country

383
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:37,087
This is yet another example of how diversity means less white p

384
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:40,927
At the heart of This flagrantly Racist premise that people should not be

385
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:47,071
Be judged on the content of their character but on the color of their skin and the people with white skin should be discriminated against

386
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:51,423
Paraphrasing Martin Luther King jr.

387
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:57,567
At the end of the sentence when you say that diversity just being blessed

388
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:58,847
Is a

389
00:19:59,103 --> 00:19:59,615
Carmen

390
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:05,503
Neo-Nazi white supremacist talking toy

391
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:06,527
Sort of point

392
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:09,087
I think his point was Martin Luther King

393
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,367
King jr. would have loved

394
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,135
Neo-Nazi

395
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:15,743
Like legitimately that diversity being the last white people is

396
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:16,511
A

397
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:17,791
Gigantic

398
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:19,327
Foundational talking

399
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,351
Employment for whites

400
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,119
Supremacist group

401
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,911
That is

402
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:23,679
Bike

403
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:29,311
When you hear stuff like that flying around from people they're really showing card

404
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:36,735
Anyway that's Paulette's in Paul's article

405
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:37,759
Article

406
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:39,295
He quotes Martin Luther King

407
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:41,343
Junior which is I think you get

408
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:43,647
Five points for that in the right-wing quote

409
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:45,951
Paraphrase

410
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:49,791
He's also using the or not to talk

411
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:57,983
In order to drive home this point the people weren't having this kind of b******* like with CNN's throwing around Paul posted some response to

412
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:58,751
Tweets from the

413
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:02,335
The people you don't like to have people normal response it's alright

414
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:06,431
Call Neo.

415
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:07,199
Course.

416
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:12,831
He had three response beats a black one is carpe donktum another I've no idea who they were

417
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:13,855
Dad sad

418
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:20,256
If you don't know is mostly notable for being a freak

419
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,024
The feminist

420
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,560
Sjw bashing

421
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:25,376
Gaston joke

422
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,144
Podcast

423
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,680
Who got super pissed off

424
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:29,984
What do you wasn't included in that Barry Weiss

425
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,080
Peace about the intellectual dark web

426
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:34,848
That's

427
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:35,616
BoBoiBoy

428
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:39,712
Horrible people that are Paul's including response yet

429
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:45,344
General

430
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,112
Great

431
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:48,416
The peasantry

432
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,440
People

433
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,232
I think you get

434
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:54,560
You get an idea of where this angle is coming from

435
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,632
Good good good. Coverage

436
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:00,704
So Alex is really

437
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,728
Concerned about

438
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,800
Take the situations happening in China in

439
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:06,592
And apply it emotion

440
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,640
E2 America listener

441
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:09,664
Yes

442
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:11,200
You trying to do that

443
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:14,784
What'll happen if there's something like that here

444
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:18,112
Shelter in place

445
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:20,672
No one's there to help you and you can't have any food

446
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:24,256
Looting and burning would begin with an H we all know that

447
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:26,560
It would look like Devils would Detroit

448
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:34,240
Great author researcher former Navy SEAL

449
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:35,520
Long time

450
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:38,592
Breakouts

451
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:40,384
Talk to him we come back

452
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:44,992
So we got Alexandra like if there was a situation where there was a coroner

453
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:46,528
19

454
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:47,296
It states

455
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:51,392
He's also having these weird qualifiers what they like tall so you can't have food

456
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:53,440
Well I mean if they said

457
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,976
Is going to happen you're going to need to

458
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,256
Usher

459
00:22:56,768 --> 00:23:02,912
Societal breakdown that's going to happen immediately

460
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:03,936
Anything like this happen

461
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:06,496
Now as an expert on the topic

462
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:09,056
To bring in noted weirdo Matt Bracken

463
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:14,432
Who's been yelling about a race war and gave collapse of civilization 4 years

464
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:17,248
Is a gas pedal down like Red Ice

465
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:19,296
Lunatic

466
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,064
Weirdo

467
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,136
So of course we'll get here man to talk about this

468
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:24,672
Public Health

469
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:25,440
Situation

470
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:27,488
I read an article from

471
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:28,768
Research

472
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:30,304
Who is

473
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,840
Describing the work he did on

474
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,400
Basically like what

475
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:37,216
What happened

476
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:40,544
Small-size catastrophes and everybody who is

477
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,568
Poor essentially

478
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,104
Bands together works

479
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,408
Together respect everybody around them

480
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:47,456
It's the rich people who are like

481
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:51,552
If we don't control these poor people they're going to start food

482
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:53,600
Burning and looting everything

483
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:54,880
And they called Italy

484
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:55,648
Panic

485
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:56,416
And that was

486
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:57,440
That was basically

487
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:59,744
Put that towards so many different

488
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,512
Catastrophe

489
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:03,072
I've been like see this is how they f*****

490
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:05,120
Because they you are so separate

491
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:07,168
From the rest of humanity they just think we're

492
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,448
We're all Subspace

493
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:10,752
Kind of an interesting

494
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:11,520
Perspective

495
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:12,544
I mean like

496
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:14,336
People whose primary

497
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:15,360
Primary function

498
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:16,384
Survive

499
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:18,432
Often would view it as

500
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:21,504
Collaborative exact like you and I we were in an

501
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:22,784
Let's say we don't know each

502
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:25,344
Probably could do better surviving

503
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,368
Together then

504
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:28,928
If we fought each other for whatever

505
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:29,952
We need to survive

506
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:32,000
That's literally how we got to this point

507
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:33,792
But people who have

508
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:35,328
You know much more.

509
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:43,776
They aren't so interested in the survival they're interested in the maintaining of whatever they have

510
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,104
And if that means hundreds of

511
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,384
The people die in their Phi

512
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:50,176
They Don't Really Care

513
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:54,528
As long as they don't have to kill themselves

514
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,088
I don't know I haven't read those things of your arrest

515
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:58,880
Printing but it seems to make some intuitive

516
00:24:59,136 --> 00:24:59,648
Sense based on

517
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:00,672
Some of the stuff

518
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:04,256
Yeah the term used was Elite Panic it's it's really interest

519
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:05,280
Make sense

520
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:06,816
So Alex gets

521
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:09,376
I mean he doesn't mention the Iowa caucuses

522
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:11,936
But I mean you know like

523
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:15,008
He doesn't have a horse in the race really so he's not

524
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,288
He's not as interested

525
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,056
In that

526
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:17,824
Is it worth

527
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,104
Avengers cha cha

528
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,688
Democratic primary Chinese

529
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:24,992
Really interesting perspective that I think it is

530
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:26,272
Self

531
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:27,296
Contradictory

532
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:29,088
Sanders surges

533
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:34,208
Why do plateaus that's why they're getting ready to go after Sanders already stole the nomination from a few years ago

534
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:34,976
Dollar Bank

535
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,000
The duet

536
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,072
Authoritarian so that's all

537
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:39,840
Coming up

538
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:43,168
Here's where Alex is going to run into trouble with

539
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:44,448
His entire prayer

540
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:50,592
Sanders is also supposed to be a leftist authoritarian universe

541
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:52,384
So now you have the left

542
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,944
Just a Thor attarian Nancy democratic

543
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,992
Establishment

544
00:25:57,248 --> 00:26:01,088
For some reason

545
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,112
He now has two

546
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,904
Explain why that's the

547
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,952
The case between the left

548
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:07,232
Authority

549
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:09,280
Set the case that the Democratic establishment

550
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:15,680
Which is really just the globalist to her trying to push socialism in order to lead to Communism in that authoritarianism

551
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:17,984
And then rounding up Alex and his friend

552
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:23,104
If that is their gold why would they screw over a democratic social

553
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:23,872
Who's running

554
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:24,896
President

555
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:31,296
It doesn't make sense why would they if they're trying to assure in a socialist dystopia this is their only shot

556
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:35,136
I would they go after the only social system fuking right

557
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:37,184
Who happens to be incredibly Papi

558
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:39,744
Why they can heat heat

559
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:40,768
It doesn't make

560
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:44,608
Sense and he doesn't really spend any time trying to

561
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:45,632
Break it down

562
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:48,192
Because he's established in the past this

563
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:49,728
Anti DNC

564
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:51,520
Anti-democratic establishment

565
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:53,312
Talking points memo

566
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:55,104
Did they screwed over Sanders in 20s

567
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:55,872
16

568
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:57,152
It's already

569
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:59,456
In the Infowars Canon terms

570
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:01,248
The talking points purple things the audience

571
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:02,528
Believes and accept

572
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:03,552
And so

573
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:04,576
Because of that

574
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:05,600
You trying to go back

575
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:07,392
To the well for that right not Ricky

576
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:09,440
Makes no sense

577
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,744
It is real never

578
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,048
I have to explain it is interesting to me

579
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:17,888
That's the right has kind of accidentally made

580
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:19,680
Sanders the only candidate

581
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:21,472
That the hard-right would fine

582
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:22,240
Palatable

583
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:28,640
On the left also you baby I accidentally yesterday in the last election

584
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:31,200
They can't then like you because you can always

585
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:32,480
Weather like

586
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:36,320
He's told they were stealing it because he has good ideas and all that's right

587
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:41,952
And it's like everything to Mastery outright anti-hillary stuff they were perpetuating by praising

588
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:42,976
Sanders

589
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:45,280
In the 2016 primary

590
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:46,304
And that would

591
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,584
Optically comebacks

592
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,608
To hurt them but

593
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:49,632
It doesn't matter by Chris

594
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:50,912
It doesn't matter who's back

595
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:52,448
I didn't mean that

596
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:57,312
Who cares I'm just saying that as a general as a general sense of priming people

597
00:27:57,568 --> 00:28:02,176
Right everybody was Prime to hate Hillary Clinton and they accidentally primed them

598
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:04,224
To be far more apathetic to sander

599
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,248
On the right

600
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,552
It's an interesting

601
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:09,344
I don't know if it

602
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,112
True rapper

603
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,208
I'm not sure either so anyway Alex is selling stuff that'll help you with

604
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:17,024
Emergency like the one that he is yelling about

605
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:19,840
In Coronavirus

606
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:21,376
And you know he

607
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,936
You got his his items

608
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:24,960
He's also got

609
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:27,776
He's also got mad

610
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:30,336
To help you

611
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:36,480
Antiviral mask

612
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:38,272
We left XL price

613
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:39,808
Sold out in one day last week

614
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:40,832
We got him

615
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:43,904
Made them cost you ten times more that

616
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,208
Amazon selling single mask

617
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,232
$3

618
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:49,792
Because I'm an opportunist

619
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:55,424
From everything I could tell Amazon is not price gouging surgical mask

620
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:59,520
I just checked and there's one I can get a 50 pack for 1799

621
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:03,616
There's another brand with a 125 pack for 89-75

622
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:06,944
No idea what Alex is talking about but I assume he's just imagine

623
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,736
Amazon jacked up their prices

624
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:09,760
The couch people

625
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:11,296
And that he's been Noble hero

626
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:13,600
Because he didn't do the thing that Amazon also didn't

627
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:20,000
I imagine it's possible that some resellers on Amazon might have gouge prices but I see no evidence

628
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:21,536
To that when I was looking over

629
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:22,304
Thanks

630
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,584
Would try and buy

631
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,888
One individual methadone

632
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:26,912
Foxy

633
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:29,472
Interesting though is that even if they did do that

634
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:32,544
The structure of Amazon almost guarantees that they're gouging

635
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,824
Strategy wouldn't work

636
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:37,152
The only way gouging works as if there's a scarcity of Ops

637
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,480
You need to be selling something that people can't easily get

638
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:41,248
From someone else

639
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:43,296
Amazon Marketplace works

640
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:48,160
Usher's that they're almost always be someone else selling the thing you're trying to go to the price of

641
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:50,976
Would likely lead to No One buying your price inflated shitzu

642
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:51,744
To begin with

643
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,048
It almost has a built-in

644
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:55,840
You from that

645
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:57,376
It doesn't always work

646
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:58,912
But it is this

647
00:29:59,168 --> 00:29:59,936
It's fairly effective

648
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,008
Amazon was criticised after Hurricane Irma

649
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:06,080
In 2017 when things like bottled water riposte

650
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:07,104
It was very high price

651
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:08,128
They were clear

652
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,408
Census of price gouging

653
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:12,224
This was not Amazon's doing

654
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,552
It was the work of third-party vendors who use Amazon Seller item

655
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,136
In response to this Amazon took action to be more proactive

656
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:21,440
Against vendors who engage in these sorts of practices

657
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:22,720
But honestly given

658
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:23,744
Alex is Legend

659
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,024
Political philosophy

660
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,328
He should not have a problem with price gouging

661
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:28,864
Specifically on Amazon

662
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:32,704
For him to be against price gouging on Amazon here's what he

663
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,472
He has to believe

664
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,544
You have a business that sells a product

665
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:39,616
They want to have access to more potential buyers

666
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:42,944
So they use a platform like Amazon to cast a wide net

667
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,248
It's basically like an advertising

668
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:48,832
For Alex to believe that price gouging is wrong

669
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:53,184
He has to believe that it's appropriate for the platform Amazon

670
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:54,464
To be able to dictate

671
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,048
Priced it which this business is able to sell its own Prada

672
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:01,888
That's nowhere near a free market position

673
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:04,960
The libertarian position generally speaking is very

674
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:05,728
Troweprice

675
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:08,288
Give you some idea of their take on it

676
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:09,312
Leave me since

677
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:10,336
Attitude published

678
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:13,664
2017 right after titled

679
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,480
There's nothing moral about opposing price gouging

680
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:18,528
With price gouging in quotes

681
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:21,344
As if to imply it's silly to think it's a real thing

682
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:28,256
There was definitely more than one article published by Denise Institute defended price gouging in September 2017

683
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:29,024
Which I think is

684
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:30,816
Really awesome

685
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:36,704
I was done with Libertarians after I heard their argument for why blackmail is fine

686
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,728
Great

687
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:44,128
You have a choice you can choose to be blackmailed or not like oh okay

688
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:45,152
Well then we're done

689
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:46,688
This article argues that

690
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,504
Gouging rules disrupt the natural processes

691
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,064
Supply and demand and it's actually it moral

692
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,880
To Levy fines or jail time on someone for quotes

693
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:57,696
Selling their own property at whatever price they walk

694
00:31:57,952 --> 00:32:00,000
Horrible

695
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:01,280
Alex Jones 4 years

696
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,560
Pretended to be a liberal

697
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:05,376
Any fetishizes the imaginary free market

698
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,912
We fail to understand

699
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:10,496
But even the basic aspects of this belief system he claims to have

700
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:13,312
I think that's probably a wise decision

701
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,080
Because if

702
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:15,872
He actually believed the city pretend

703
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:18,688
He'd have to openly denounced the Civil Rights Act

704
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:20,224
Back support child labor

705
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,760
And if he follows them

706
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:22,528
School

707
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:24,320
You have to believe that quote

708
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:27,136
Parent does not have the right to aggress against his

709
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:27,904
Trials

710
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,184
But also that

711
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:35,584
The parents should not have a legal obligation to feed clothes or educate his children writes that such applications

712
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,608
Until positive

713
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:38,400
First upon the parent

714
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:39,936
Private be right

715
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:41,216
The parrot of his right

716
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:45,056
The pair therefore may not murder or mutilated child

717
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:49,152
But the law properly Outlaws

718
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:51,968
But the parents should have the legal right

719
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:52,736
Tunak

720
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:56,064
Feed the child allowed to die

721
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:58,368
Directly from

722
00:32:58,624 --> 00:32:59,904
Institutes write-up on

723
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:00,928
Shelter been right

724
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:03,744
I think I think that's a

725
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:09,120
Babies get rid of libertarian and say their fascist but weird

726
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:12,448
Like they're not they're not the mainstream Fashions they're just

727
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:14,752
Weird fashion fashion

728
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,824
Alex took on the label of libertarian never really can

729
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,592
Considering the

730
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:20,640
Completely f***** up things are entailed by

731
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:21,664
Applying it

732
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,944
Primary beliefs

733
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,224
The real world situation

734
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:27,040
He's never really been a liver

735
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:27,808
Battalion

736
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:34,208
He's been a Libertarian in the same way that that guy you knew in college you like weed too much to be on the right but was a little too right

737
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:35,744
Places to swing with the left was

738
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:44,960
That's the wrong Paul libertarian

739
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,008
Maybe

740
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:50,848
Alex is not interested in first principles or actual philosophy of belief

741
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:52,128
He's interested in selling

742
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,480
Primary motivation runs in that direction its position

743
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:59,296
Alienating discussed most right-thinking people

744
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:04,416
Like in a disaster it's your right to pray Scout even if you're watching people die Who

745
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:05,952
You could have say right there

746
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:10,048
My point here is that most Libertarian beliefs are insane and very

747
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:11,072
Unpopular with most of

748
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:12,096
To the public and even out

749
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:17,472
I would almost admiring if you got on aretys like it's crisis time I have what you're

750
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:20,032
Need the prices go the f******

751
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:28,224
Wallet the same time saying he would never price coach

752
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:29,760
Libertarian stance

753
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:33,088
Like free-market s*** that you pretend to believe that it is be like

754
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:34,624
I have what you need

755
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,160
Pay up suckers

756
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:39,744
Like that would be at least in line with his beliefs but you know the reason

757
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,512
They can't do that

758
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:43,584
Is because he's also artificially

759
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,608
Trying to create

760
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:45,888
Adam Ant

761
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:47,936
He has the

762
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:48,704
The hard work

763
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,728
Of trying

764
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:50,752
To create this

765
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:53,824
Panicking is already a year

766
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,360
Inflation of demand

767
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:57,408
She'll be like

768
00:34:57,664 --> 00:35:01,504
I have the supply suck it kind of hurt his ability to

769
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,272
To do that

770
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:03,552
Might it might

771
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:05,856
Honesty does not work in free market capital

772
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:08,416
It's not the best

773
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,208
So

774
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:15,328
Alex said that Matt Bracken was going to be coming in to talk about this year disaster

775
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,912
And before he gets to it might break and gives a little bit of a shout-out

776
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:20,192
To group

777
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:21,472
He's

778
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:22,752
I guess fans of

779
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:24,800
Just for a moment

780
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:30,432
If you can indulge me I want to give a shout out to the the Appalachian battalion

781
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:32,480
The mossy oak militia

782
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:34,528
And do

783
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:36,064
This is our secret

784
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,112
One of our secret ritual

785
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:40,160
Recognition so enjoy haircut

786
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:41,440
Give me a picture of that

787
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:45,792
Not because the mossy oak militia anyway

788
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:48,864
Have to be wearing this today so

789
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:51,424
Anyways Carter inside joke Among Us

790
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,216
People like to shoot in the woods

791
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:55,776
Anyway

792
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:57,056
What a f****** dork

793
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:02,432
So the mossy oak militia is a name that pops up a bit in Forums on like AR-15

794
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:06,528
Keen.com until I'm not sure it's a real

795
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:12,416
It seems like a name that's thrown around to denote someone who seeks to embody the vibe of a guy wearing camo

796
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:13,696
In one post

797
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:17,024
Discussing the upcoming at that point Virginia gun rally

798
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,560
From January 20th

799
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:23,168
The poster discusses Howard be a coming together of quote businessman / profession

800
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,984
The local boy in blue jeans and a t-shirt

801
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,544
The Fudd in his coveralls in a straw hat

802
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,104
The mossy oak militia and the tactical gear guy

803
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:35,968
It seems to me that this is just sort of a designation for right-wing cosplayers who put on

804
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:37,504
Fatigues rally

805
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:42,624
I might be wrong in the Bracken is actually talking about a real group and if so that's even more f***** up

806
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,160
Sometimes means that Alex's allowed

807
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:45,952
Guest on the show to shout-out a private

808
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:46,720
Militia

809
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:47,488
That's

810
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,560
Probably not the case I think this is just a dumb old man

811
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:52,096
Yeah

812
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:53,120
He's just a dork

813
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:55,168
Do you mean by soul

814
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:57,984
Matt Bracken

815
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,264
Is a guy

816
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,080
I mean luck here's all we need to really know about

817
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:03,360
Mustache

818
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,712
Via

819
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:12,064
B b b b guns

820
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:13,600
Sure

821
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:20,768
He's not a doctor he has no public health or anything

822
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:26,400
Sing like that nothing less Alex wants his expert opinion on this Coronavirus

823
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:28,192
Research

824
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:31,264
Do you think it's man-made you think it escaped from a lab

825
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:36,384
Why is it being hyped up a gut-level what do you think this virus is

826
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,432
I think it

827
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:45,088
Huge pandemic like this today you know it almost is a moot point whether it's natural or men

828
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:46,112
Handmade because

829
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:52,256
I don't understand why that's all really know the truth there's never going to be a record that comes out that everybody believes

830
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:53,792
What cop out

831
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:55,840
It's a whole chicken

832
00:37:56,096 --> 00:38:02,240
Point hop out get the f*** out of here into the Coronavirus

833
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:04,032
Is completely meaningless

834
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:10,432
You recording to his own self-written bio there's literally no reason to take anything he says about biology or health

835
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:14,784
According to his bio he has an undergraduate degree in Russian study

836
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:17,088
What you got back in 1979

837
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:20,672
Any was a Navy SEAL for a while then in 1993 he built

838
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:24,256
About Russian studies there's the northern lights in Russia

839
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:29,376
Corona boom Coronavirus

840
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:34,752
There's nothing in his background that really makes him qualified to speak on whether or not I coronavirus is man-made

841
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:37,824
Makes him the perfect guest for Alex to ask that question to

842
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:40,896
They aren't interested in reality or analysis there

843
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,432
Didn't extreme weirdos saying

844
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:43,968
Sensational things to drive sale

845
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,248
That's always going

846
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:46,784
I went to a wedding

847
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,832
Inn in Maine

848
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:49,856
And it was held at the

849
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:52,160
It's like summer camp place where

850
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:53,440
Religious kids would go

851
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:55,744
And I remember

852
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:57,792
This incredibly strike

853
00:38:58,048 --> 00:38:59,328
Kingseed where the woman who work

854
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:00,608
Is

855
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:01,376
Making of

856
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:03,680
She works there

857
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:04,704
She makes fires

858
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:05,984
Every night

859
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,312
Every summer for her entire tenure there

860
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:11,104
And she's trying to make this fire and

861
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,152
Four different dudes are walking in there in like

862
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:18,528
Hey how about you try using some newspaper and s*** like that and it's like that that aggressive white dude

863
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:19,552
To use in

864
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:20,320
Nothing

865
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:22,624
The confidence to be like

866
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:28,000
And I know how to solve the Coronavirus

867
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:30,560
You made a boat

868
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:37,984
You've got more boats than me so Alex asked me this man made real naturally-occurring it's a

869
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:44,384
Point because no one will ever agree on Bracken elaborates on that'll

870
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:49,504
There's always going to be theories that are that are competing

871
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,344
So I would say you know sure it could be snake to bat to man

872
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:57,184
Canadian biome

873
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,768
Research lab to Wuhan bio lab

874
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:01,792
Research lab

875
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:04,864
And then it gets out somebody in the lab and

876
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,912
They go home and it gets out that way

877
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:09,216
Don't think we'll ever know definitively

878
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:11,520
There aren't competing theories

879
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:16,896
There's science and then there's a load of b******* Alex and Braken 30 round spreads

880
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:19,712
This is a really dishonest framing device that Matt Bracken

881
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:24,064
Confusing there's an insistence that dumb completely baseless stuff it's

882
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:28,928
Discuss. In Fort Worth is exactly the same as the work researchers at the CDC or doing

883
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,464
There's literally no

884
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,232
Points to them

885
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,048
The head of the World Health Organization at John

886
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:35,072
F****** Rappaport

887
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:40,448
Write this is ridiculous they are competing theories one is a theory okay on the others bulshit

888
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:42,496
Alright well I think we need to teach

889
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:43,264
The controversy

890
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,824
Controversy

891
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:50,176
Nobody believe nobody will ever know whether evolution is a thing that happens

892
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:52,224
It's impossible to have a

893
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,504
That is the like

894
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,272
Black just

895
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:55,552
Put on

896
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:59,648
Lele Universal scale what do you say

897
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:00,416
Like yes

898
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,488
There are people who are taking this very seriously

899
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:05,024
I saw meme

900
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:05,792
Right

901
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:07,328
We are the same okay

902
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:13,728
We are the same so this guy is worked in this sort of I don't know virologia field for his entire life he's got

903
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:16,288
Got several phds

904
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,104
I think you've got something to say my brother

905
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:20,640
Awesome

906
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:23,200
Stop

907
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:25,760
Doug talking about like

908
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:28,320
Hey riddle riddle issue your man why isn't Trump stop

909
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:29,344
Travel from China

910
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:36,000
The UN has had some emergency but doesn't want travel restricted but most countries are incredible

911
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:42,144
Done that yet answer that question as best we can on the other side it's Friday we're live

912
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:47,008
We've discussed this in the past but suffice it to say that experts do not agree with Alex and his assertion

913
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:49,056
The shutting down travels the best way to practice

914
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:50,336
Containment of an opera

915
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:56,479
It's pretty well understood in the academic Community which is why when you hear people who are insisting the travel should be shut down

916
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:59,551
It's a pretty fair assumption to make it there either not very informed

917
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:02,367
Or they just want travel shut down for other reason

918
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:03,903
And this is a good

919
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:04,927
Excuses

920
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:08,255
Variegated

921
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:11,071
Interesting Lee Trump is

922
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:14,911
Not stopped all travel to and from China probably because the experts know this would

923
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:15,679
Would not have the

924
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:16,703
Desired result

925
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:17,983
Screaming in person

926
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:20,287
Cedars of the way to go and you can't

927
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:21,567
Practice appropriate

928
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:23,103
Screening of Travelers shutdown

929
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:28,991
And that scenario all the people who come in and out of the country are unaccounted for and completely unknown variable

930
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:34,367
When you leave travel open your able to monitor people coming in the country and track people or suspect

931
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:35,391
I'm having condition

932
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:38,207
And you can even isolate them if you need to

933
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:40,767
You give up literally all of that possibility

934
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:43,583
If you shutdown travel you in no way guarantee the people

935
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:44,351
Art still going to be

936
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:45,887
Be coming across borders

937
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:46,911
So it it's

938
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:50,239
It's something that's only one of the factors that

939
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:52,799
Sitter like how much it would disrupt

940
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:54,335
Economics

941
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:55,359
If Trump stopped

942
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:56,895
All travel from Sun

943
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:58,687
MBA gigantic

944
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:02,783
I'll just use this as an excuse to add more

945
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:06,623
Non-white countries to the travel

946
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:20,191
I'm not sure that the I don't know if I heard it framed as like the coronavirus has anything

947
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:22,751
To do with him adding those countries

948
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:25,567
He's using it as an excuse to do that buddy

949
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:26,847
You sure seems to be

950
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:30,431
Fine with stopping some travel sure

951
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:36,831
It's not actually travel that that is inaccurate countries can still

952
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:38,367
They can still apply for like

953
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:39,135
Visitor

954
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,951
Immigration

955
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:45,023
Stop from

956
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:48,863
Nigeria or Eritrea Kyrgyzstan in Myanmar

957
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:53,215
And the people from Sudan in Tanzania will not be allowed to apply for lottery

958
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:54,495
Right

959
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:55,519
Do you still

960
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:58,079
Creeping towards this

961
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:00,639
Sing yep yep

962
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:01,663
Yep

963
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:03,199
But not that I'm not interested in

964
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:09,343
Could not handle

965
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:11,135
Adding a travel ban

966
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:13,695
Fury to the the whole survey

967
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:19,071
Little bit about the impeachment stuff and he's pretty convinced that they're going to vote

968
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:20,351
To acquit

969
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:21,119
That Eve

970
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:22,143
Friday evening

971
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:23,423
31st

972
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:27,007
That's pretty standard of its position

973
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:35,455
You're the really have much to add to the the entire thing but he does try to rewrite his own history

974
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:37,503
Why the hell did

975
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:39,807
Trump

976
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:43,647
Right now as they try to get Witnesses which will be Bolton

977
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:45,439
So Alex is trying to say that

978
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:48,511
He warned Trump not to hire boat

979
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:49,535
Steve pieczenik

980
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:52,095
Did Alex argue to Steve pieczenik

981
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:54,655
V Moody and apparatchiks

982
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:56,703
And he would do Trump's bidding

983
00:44:56,959 --> 00:45:01,055
He knew his way around the swamp and so he would be a really useful tool because

984
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:03,359
That's what Rodger Stone have told Alex

985
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:05,151
Presumably

986
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:08,479
Is it true but disgust on it for the Rodger Stone

987
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:12,575
Play poker together

988
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:13,855
It talk

989
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:18,463
But Rodger was like 90 John Bolton School Alex went that way

990
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:21,023
Steve pieczenik was the dissenting voice

991
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:26,655
Who is that Alex is trying to protect

992
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:28,447
You rationalized

993
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:34,335
Whether they play poker or not we all know stone is ratfuck his way up to V

994
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:36,383
Sooner or later so

995
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:37,151
They

996
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:43,295
Definitely know each other

997
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:46,623
So it matches anyway the news

998
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:48,415
Couldn't handle Incorporated

999
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:49,439
Eating this this

1000
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:50,463
Immigration

1001
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:51,487
Crackdown

1002
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:52,767
Something

1003
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:54,303
In that new cycle

1004
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:57,375
Dogs can't handle his own

1005
00:45:57,631 --> 00:45:58,143
Show either

1006
00:45:58,655 --> 00:45:59,423
Is this breaking news

1007
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:08,127
Lago gatecrashed shots fired

1008
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:20,927
Shots fired

1009
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:33,727
Palm Beach

1010
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:39,103
Checkpoint near the property

1011
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:53,183
Bible getaway

1012
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:54,975
It's still out there

1013
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:01,119
Ridgid somebody offer medication

1014
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:02,399
Jesus

1015
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:05,215
Or is it a psycho

1016
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:07,519
Kill the president or trying to attack him

1017
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:09,823
I physically of Happy

1018
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:15,711
You can tell by the way Alex is reporting this it's a story that he wants to be about someone attack

1019
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:16,479
Donald Trump

1020
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:20,575
You can tell because there is no information available to him at this point but he's

1021
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:27,231
Trying to decide how to portray editorial choice in the direction we take this

1022
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:31,071
But people have been attacking me here you know

1023
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:36,447
In reality this is a case of an impaired driver driving very erratically and dangerously near me

1024
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:39,519
All the shots were fired were fired at

1025
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:41,567
The driver and there's no reason to think the

1026
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:43,871
Did she was trying to even get in tomorrow Olga

1027
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:46,431
According to ABC News

1028
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:47,711
2 checkpoint

1029
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:49,759
But did not enter Mar-A-Lago

1030
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:51,039
The sheriff

1031
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:52,575
Alex's favorite kind of Lawman

1032
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:53,855
Even said quote

1033
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:55,391
This is not a terrorist

1034
00:47:56,415 --> 00:48:02,047
It all began with officers were called to the scene where a woman was reported as quoted

1035
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:03,327
Several miles away

1036
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:04,095
Tomorrow logout

1037
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:06,911
When the cops came she fled and the cops follow

1038
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:08,959
Coincidentally heading towards Mar-A-Lago

1039
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:09,727
Bike Windsor

1040
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:14,591
She was driving on the wrong side of the road and flew through checkpoint so I guess the police

1041
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:15,871
Decided to open fire on her

1042
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:16,639
Her car

1043
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:17,919
She managed to get away and

1044
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:20,735
Fletcher Motel the police have been following and they arrested her there

1045
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:24,575
Honestly this is a story that in another time

1046
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:25,599
Alex will be covering

1047
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:26,623
Clear evidence of

1048
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:28,415
Horrible police station

1049
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:35,071
2009 in this woman is a nice white Ron Paul support just want to have a good time dancing on her car

1050
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:37,375
You can see how this entire story would be played

1051
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:38,655
Sweetly differently

1052
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:41,727
But now every story is told through the prism of nationalist

1053
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:43,775
Turn Alex's weirdo Community being under a

1054
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:46,335
A story that has literally no.

1055
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:48,127
Details on it is being told

1056
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:49,919
Speculation that it's in

1057
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:50,687
Attack on truck

1058
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:52,223
Because that is what you wanted

1059
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:55,551
If this is an attack on Trump you can yell about it for the next

1060
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:56,319
Gear

1061
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:57,087
Police shooting

1062
00:48:57,343 --> 00:48:59,903
He can use it as evidence that the left is violent to drink

1063
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:00,927
Dakil Auction Service

1064
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:02,207
But it's not

1065
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:04,255
It was a drunk lady driving erratically and

1066
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:05,023
The cops decided

1067
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:06,815
Yeah I'm going to

1068
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:07,839
I'm going to go with every

1069
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:10,399
Part of this story should be blamed on the cob

1070
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:11,423
Yeah

1071
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:12,959
She was just dancing man

1072
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:16,287
I think that you probably

1073
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:19,103
I don't know all the details

1074
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:25,503
Run from the details I was able to clean it doesn't seem like she handled the situation very well

1075
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:27,295
4:00

1076
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:33,439
It really really really doesn't she made some bad choices the police made it seems of work

1077
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:37,535
Mar-A-Lago

1078
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:39,839
Anyway later in the show Alex gets

1079
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:41,375
An update on this

1080
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:42,911
I ate some more the details

1081
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:45,983
Really still feels like he wants to push

1082
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:47,775
This as a trump letter attack

1083
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:52,639
Could have just been somebody that was going the wrong way and I'll pay attention that could have been drinking

1084
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:58,783
And then you didn't you do that the security like that you're going to get shot at

1085
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:01,087
That's that's sad but

1086
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:04,415
There's going to be glad in a

1087
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:05,951
Climate weather saying

1088
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:07,743
Trump is literally Hitler

1089
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:11,839
Having a nation is Hitler

1090
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:15,167
The only person with an e

1091
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:16,703
Election Hitler we see

1092
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:20,287
Is George Soros literally was a Nazi collaborator

1093
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:24,639
Financial Networks

1094
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:26,175
What is Hitler

1095
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:31,039
You kind of get the sense there that like the narrative he's more interested in telling is the one where

1096
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:36,671
This is an example of blowback from Soros funding and Hitler

1097
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:39,231
So I mean you get it at least we have some more

1098
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:44,095
Maybe

1099
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:45,631
The Jordan I got some

1100
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:46,655
I told you

1101
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:48,703
My favorite one of my favorite big brag

1102
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:50,495
Is going to be on this episode no coming up

1103
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:52,287
Text Clara then we got something

1104
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:53,055
Been really fun

1105
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:55,103
Then we got something really stupid

1106
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:56,127
Okay so that's

1107
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:57,663
The syllabus for the next

1108
00:50:58,175 --> 00:50:59,199
Little Liars

1109
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:00,735
So get excited

1110
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:05,599
What I'm saying is have some fun while you can

1111
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:07,647
Here is Alex Jones's big brag

1112
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:13,279
I'm not bragging but I was actually on the road to being like a top voice over guy that was voicing

1113
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:15,839
Major trailers seprafilm TV ad

1114
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:17,631
Insurance company commercials

1115
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:20,959
But if Obama

1116
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:22,751
When Obama got in

1117
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:25,567
1 year $890,000

1118
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:35,039
Scott built on voiceover mine

1119
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:38,879
Happened as soon as I criticize Obama

1120
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:40,671
The Jabs wings

1121
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:47,839
According to ZipRecruiter the national average salary annually for working voice-over artist is 6

1122
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:48,863
$5,000

1123
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:54,239
Only 7% of working video people make over $198,000

1124
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:57,311
And these will be your big names in the field

1125
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:03,455
The idea that Alex Jones made $890,000 in a year doing voiceover work is laughable

1126
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:09,855
None of the stories about him discussing his early years in public access or local Austin radio

1127
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:13,695
None of them mention his ridiculously explosive voiceover career

1128
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:20,095
There are credits to his name from that. You can find which would be the case if you done any work in film

1129
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:21,119
Azhar TV

1130
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:22,911
Keep records for that

1131
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:24,447
Sure they don't just stop

1132
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:30,079
By the time Obama was elected Alex was already yours into being a pretty widely known Luna

1133
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:33,151
He put out his Bohemian Grove film in 2000

1134
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:36,735
After 9/11 cemented in his images of 9/11

1135
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:37,503
Conspiracy theory

1136
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:41,343
I don't want the image to be that he criticized Obama and lost

1137
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:43,647
About a million dollars a year and its side Hustle

1138
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:47,999
Because the only real currency and right-wing media is victimhood

1139
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:49,791
He needs you to think that he's been

1140
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:51,583
Depressed political positions

1141
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:52,351
Unfortunately

1142
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:53,631
He's making all of the

1143
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:54,655
Sup

1144
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:56,191
The figures that he comes up with the sound

1145
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:56,959
Comical

1146
00:52:57,471 --> 00:53:00,799
If Alex made $800,000 in a year doing voice-overs

1147
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:02,847
He would have legitimately been one of the top

1148
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:03,615
People in the field

1149
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:08,223
Stress this enough there would have been so many pieces about him in trade magazine

1150
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:11,551
Give me the Talk of the Town

1151
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:12,831
Voiceover is is

1152
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:15,647
Primarily funded by a video game

1153
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:19,231
And I was like you're not making 108 $90,000

1154
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:19,999
Pre

1155
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:20,767
2008

1156
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:23,327
You might you might if you were like got big ad

1157
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:25,119
I made

1158
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:30,495
Yeah I mean like a John DiMaggio isn't making

1159
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:33,055
$800,000 a year and he's one of the best

1160
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:34,079
I bet he

1161
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:35,871
I bet I bet here

1162
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:37,151
Nobody's making even more

1163
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:40,735
I genuinely do I think

1164
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:44,831
I have a little bit lucky drama DVDs are going as hot as they used to

1165
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:46,111
Spell

1166
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:46,879
Is that deal

1167
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:49,183
I'm not saying that Alex doesn't have some

1168
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:50,975
Skills with voiceover Jeff

1169
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:55,583
The only places I believe he's practiced this art in his own film

1170
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:56,607
And enforce

1171
00:53:57,887 --> 00:54:02,751
Because there's a little trade secret that I know from my time trying to get into voice overs

1172
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:06,847
Dude with voices like mine and Alex's are not in high demand

1173
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:12,479
It is super competitive area of the market cuz there's already a ton of very established voice actors with

1174
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:13,759
Deepest graph of voices

1175
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:17,087
So even if Alex did have a decent voice no one would care

1176
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:19,647
Hebe guy number 5000

1177
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:20,671
Who fits that mold

1178
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:21,951
In order to get me work

1179
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:24,511
He'd need a really good voice over agent

1180
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:26,815
And you have to be working on it full-time

1181
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:29,375
Sending out like sample Edition

1182
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:30,143
Tapes

1183
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:31,679
Four Scripts

1184
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:32,447
It would be

1185
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:35,263
Such an intense process for him to break in

1186
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:36,031
With a voice

1187
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:37,055
But he has no yeah

1188
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:38,847
The picture that Alex's paint

1189
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:40,639
Depict a reality that does not exist

1190
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:43,455
He was a number-one voice-over talent in the world

1191
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:44,735
Criticized Obama

1192
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:46,015
But had it all taken away from

1193
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:47,295
Such horseshoe

1194
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:54,207
Also it's pretty funny to imagine that someone with the political beliefs that Alex has whatever join the f****** Screen Actors Guild

1195
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:57,535
There's plenty of non-union working getting voiceovers

1196
00:54:57,791 --> 00:55:00,351
So that wouldn't even be a necessary thing for him to do

1197
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:01,375
South bulshit

1198
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:05,983
Just complete s*** yeah I don't remember him in any early 2000

1199
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:07,263
The anime which is

1200
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:09,567
I bet

1201
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:11,871
That he did do some like local

1202
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:18,527
Oh yeah I wouldn't have especially because he was working in Public Access Radio I know from my time when I enter data

1203
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:20,319
The radio station a lot of the radio

1204
00:55:20,575 --> 00:55:22,367
Commercials the voice-overs word on B

1205
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:25,439
Is everything got kicked a couple bucks

1206
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:31,839
Yeah they worked all morning and then recorded a couple of probos after after their show and then they went

1207
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:34,911
Doing a little bit of that $890,000 in

1208
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:36,191
Year

1209
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:36,959
The fuc

1210
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:37,983
Out of here

1211
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:40,031
Show me

1212
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:43,359
Tax return

1213
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:44,383
Credit

1214
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:45,919
Yeah that would be fun

1215
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:47,711
Some sort of proof of that cuz if so

1216
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:50,527
That's crazy story

1217
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:57,951
I'm trying to latch onto whatever conspiracies are floating around about the coronavirus outside

1218
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:00,511
Chicken

1219
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:02,303
Some of them a real stupid

1220
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:05,119
None of them have been like

1221
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:07,935
Real laughable

1222
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:10,751
Stupid busy texting is pretty laughable soup

1223
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:13,823
It is once you get down to like what that patent was

1224
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:17,663
This one

1225
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:18,687
Right in front

1226
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:19,711
Oh my God

1227
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:20,479
This is bad

1228
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:27,391
There was an article on show laughing

1229
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:33,791
Real operation and

1230
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:40,191
Not a huge Resident Evil fan I am a fan of that to Easter p.m. check whatever 90s

1231
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:46,591
Eagle Corporation

1232
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:52,735
Google

1233
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:53,759
Got it

1234
00:56:54,015 --> 00:57:00,159
Because the oldest operating intelligence agency Kentucky

1235
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:07,071
Ever been right

1236
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:13,471
This is like the Umbrella Corporation and then my buddy change Connors me this this year

1237
00:57:13,727 --> 00:57:18,079
Image and it says umbrella

1238
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:22,687
Corporation Bradshaw Tamika W awesome thing

1239
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:31,135
The actual research laboratory where they had the exact same symbol but it's

1240
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:32,159
Red

1241
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:36,255
Engrave engrave

1242
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:40,095
That's got to be a joke

1243
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:42,911
Translate

1244
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:49,055
Oh my God

1245
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:52,383
I don't want to get too deep into the Laura Resident Evil

1246
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:57,247
The games on the movies diverts a little bit and honestly I can't keep should straighten my head

1247
00:57:58,271 --> 00:57:59,551
Amanda

1248
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:02,111
Later on she becomes

1249
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:04,415
Clone fighting the lights White

1250
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:05,439
Look what's in Port

1251
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:07,999
Your other than Alex being attracted to Milla Jovovich

1252
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:10,815
Is there's a meme

1253
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:14,143
Where's the city of the logo similar to the Umbrella Corporation

1254
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:14,911
Slogo

1255
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:16,703
And that is convince some dumb dumb

1256
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:18,239
Let it must mean that this

1257
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:19,263
Roblox

1258
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:20,799
Is created by a weapon

1259
00:58:21,055 --> 00:58:23,871
Much like the Umbrella Corporation did with the t-virus

1260
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:24,895
In

1261
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:27,455
Yeah I mean I can't

1262
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:33,855
I can't find any flaws in that theory 121 leads to be

1263
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:36,415
Hammers at home it's Corona translates to Raccoon

1264
00:58:39,487 --> 00:58:45,631
The man that went around with flaming at this place with the Resident Evil style logo was the Wuhan Institute of virology

1265
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:47,423
But it clearly says

1266
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:48,959
If you look at the uncropped image

1267
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:51,007
Shanghai on the front of the building

1268
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:52,031
That's because

1269
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:56,383
Actually a biotech lab in Shanghai would you like 500 miles away from

1270
00:58:57,151 --> 00:59:01,759
Also Snopes looked into it and it doesn't even appear that this biotech lab in Shanghai is even open

1271
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:04,319
Seems like it's going out of business

1272
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:09,695
Geek culture the website posted an article about this lab having a logo similar to the Umbrella Corporation in

1273
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:10,975
In June of last year

1274
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:17,631
And in the same article that discuss a skin care clinic in Vietnam having an identical logo to Umbrella even down to the color

1275
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:19,935
There's actually even another article about that

1276
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:21,471
Skincare company in Vietnam

1277
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:22,751
2017 about it

1278
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:24,799
Are there at the end

1279
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:26,847
Alex is misunderstanding another me

1280
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:29,151
When he says that you translate Corona

1281
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:29,919
Raccoon

1282
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:31,711
In reality

1283
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:32,735
The meme is Vic

1284
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:39,135
Corona is an anagram of raccoon which is the name of the city

1285
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:43,231
The outbreak in Resident Evil raccoon city all right

1286
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:49,631
Major problem with this theory is that if you look at the word you might notice the raccoon has to season it where is Corona does not

1287
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:52,703
I don't know just kind of makes this a dumb anagram

1288
00:59:55,263 --> 00:59:59,103
H-E-B clear the spelling with 2 C's a raccoon is cannon in resin

1289
00:59:59,615 --> 01:00:00,383
But that is how it spelled

1290
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:02,943
This is super super stupid

1291
01:00:03,455 --> 01:00:05,759
But it also it's really important to point out things like

1292
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:10,111
Alex is taking the time to cover the dump meme s*** as if it means

1293
01:00:10,879 --> 01:00:14,975
This is the level of analysis and insight he brings to his work and it's so sad

1294
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:17,023
He said idiots like Mike Adams

1295
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:18,559
I'm coming on to say things like this

1296
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:20,095
It's over for Humanity

1297
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:22,143
Only be Lone Survivor

1298
01:00:22,655 --> 01:00:23,679
Because of the outbreak

1299
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:25,471
Humanity is over

1300
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:29,311
Desperate to blame is Imagine enemies for this that he sings to his level of shitheadra

1301
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:30,591
Pretending dumb hoax

1302
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:33,407
Beam some idiot posted online or worth anyone's time

1303
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:37,247
This is the best work Alex can do because he's not even trying Eddie

1304
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:44,159
He doesn't do any research he doesn't prepare anything outside of the show just shows up and gets mad at a picture of Adam Schiff

1305
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:46,207
Yep pretends it's not the show

1306
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:50,559
All this information comes with dumb beans and headlines series on websites run by him

1307
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:52,863
0 editorial standards

1308
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:54,399
The tentative make s*** up

1309
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:55,167
And so

1310
01:00:55,423 --> 01:00:56,703
This is what you get for the show

1311
01:00:56,959 --> 01:00:59,007
Dumb memes presented his research

1312
01:00:59,263 --> 01:01:00,799
Alex yelling about his feelings

1313
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:03,103
Did anyone doesn't

1314
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:03,871
Like people

1315
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:06,943
I don't care his audiences 20,000

1316
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:08,735
Some people the idea that there is

1317
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:09,503
Anybody

1318
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:10,527
Who doesn't see through this

1319
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:12,319
Very sad

1320
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:14,111
I remember

1321
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:15,135
Plan

1322
01:01:15,903 --> 01:01:17,951
Collaborative storytelling games online

1323
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:18,719
When I was like

1324
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:21,791
Angelfire website

1325
01:01:22,047 --> 01:01:24,095
What if we had banded.

1326
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:24,863
From using it

1327
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:32,031
It was just it was our little secret Club adults were like I don't understand this this internet culture we just get rid of them

1328
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:33,567
No memes like that

1329
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:36,127
I don't think that would work

1330
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:39,711
So this is dumb

1331
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:40,735
Yes

1332
01:01:40,991 --> 01:01:41,759
This is very

1333
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:42,783
Super

1334
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:44,063
Raccoon

1335
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:44,831
Corona

1336
01:01:45,087 --> 01:01:46,367
Translate

1337
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:47,647
Logo

1338
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:48,415
Proof

1339
01:01:48,927 --> 01:01:50,463
Not good I thought Coronavirus

1340
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:51,231
Crown but

1341
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:52,511
I got it I was way off

1342
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:53,279
Alex

1343
01:01:55,327 --> 01:01:56,351
Why would they use

1344
01:01:56,607 --> 01:01:57,119
At logo

1345
01:01:57,375 --> 01:02:00,703
Why in the hell does it look like they have that symbol

1346
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:04,287
I got to look it up I spent like 10 minutes this morning and couldn't find

1347
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:06,847
When they got that logo

1348
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:10,687
But it appears the company in the logo comes

1349
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:11,967
Resident Evil

1350
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:16,831
Why would you pick the Resident Evil symbol of evil Global Corporation

1351
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:20,159
Famous ocean

1352
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:21,951
This is babe

1353
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:22,719
It's not

1354
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:27,071
Girl hundred possible reason to that lab to use that symbol similar to the Resident Evil 1

1355
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:28,095
Off the top my head

1356
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:34,495
The owner think the owner doesn't know about Resident Evil just think it looks cool or the owner one

1357
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:36,031
Wanted to troll idiots like Alex

1358
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:37,567
There a lot of possibilities

1359
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:38,335
But it's

1360
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:41,663
There's one thing that I'm confident about its that this is not you

1361
01:02:41,919 --> 01:02:42,431
Analysis

1362
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:43,711
Not about to crack this case

1363
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:44,991
Also

1364
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:50,623
Does Alex think the people shouldn't be able to use certain logos cuz they're associated with fictitious villain

1365
01:02:50,879 --> 01:02:55,743
Real free-speech hero over here when was the last time you saw anybody use a golden gun that's been

1366
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:58,303
Retired does he want the state to be able to

1367
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:03,167
Exert control over a business owners First Amendment rights to use whatever iconography they want

1368
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:07,007
Also does this extended countless products are marketed with.

1369
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:13,151
Pictures of the Christian devil

1370
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:14,175
Why would they

1371
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:17,247
Tell me give me one good reason so how did the square with Alex

1372
01:03:17,503 --> 01:03:18,527
Constantly playing the in

1373
01:03:18,783 --> 01:03:24,927
Imperial March from Star Wars which is the anthem of the bad guy

1374
01:03:25,183 --> 01:03:25,695
Himself house

1375
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:30,303
The Hello Kitty show over with the Star Wars theme music

1376
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:34,143
How could catch on Williams

1377
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:38,751
That's what that

1378
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:40,287
Yeah that really how come

1379
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:41,055
How y

1380
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:42,079
Why would they use

1381
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:45,919
How did f****** Resident Evil come up with the logo it's the same way

1382
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:47,455
Logos are hard to come up with

1383
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:48,479
You just start drawing

1384
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:49,759
Eventually you're like I like

1385
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:52,319
Why is he speaking today

1386
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:56,159
Cuz raccoon translates to Corona death

1387
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:58,719
Alex is operating off the

1388
01:03:59,231 --> 01:04:00,255
Not true

1389
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:05,887
Piece of information that this logo is on a lab that is the Wuhan virology

1390
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:08,703
Connecting a bunch

1391
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:10,239
To stuff together here

1392
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:12,799
This is just sloppy

1393
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:18,687
Where this came from a lot of experts believe in shadowy group Todd in the US Military

1394
01:04:18,943 --> 01:04:22,527
Steps in Canada of a committee actually genome

1395
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:24,319
Renee

1396
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:26,623
He is now

1397
01:04:30,463 --> 01:04:31,999
Being tracked back to this company

1398
01:04:34,815 --> 01:04:38,143
Coronavirus is before stars of the Coronavirus

1399
01:04:39,935 --> 01:04:45,055
Play Chinese Labs you better not ask question

1400
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:47,359
Conspiracy

1401
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:48,895
Talking about it yesterday

1402
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:51,711
Claimed

1403
01:04:52,735 --> 01:04:54,783
Almost two months until earlier this week

1404
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:57,855
Originated in a seafood market in Wuhan

1405
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:02,207
Animals inside batsuit

1406
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:03,999
Or snakes

1407
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:06,303
That is not the case

1408
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:09,631
The published Study last weekend

1409
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:10,655
Demonstrating

1410
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:14,751
Set of the original 40 14 of them had no contact

1411
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:17,055
Capital Seafood Market including patient zero

1412
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:19,359
Hematologist at that

1413
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:21,151
Into the seafood market

1414
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:25,247
We still don't know where it originated

1415
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:26,783
Seafood market

1416
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:29,855
Food Processing Company

1417
01:05:31,903 --> 01:05:34,207
China Wuhan also has China's only

1418
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:35,999
Safety level

1419
01:05:36,255 --> 01:05:37,791
Super Laboratory

1420
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:41,375
The world's most deadly pathogens to include

1421
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:42,655
Coronavirus

1422
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:49,311
Call Trish Redden on all flights the US

1423
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:52,895
Has landed saying

1424
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:55,199
The 15% death rate which I don't believe

1425
01:05:56,223 --> 01:05:56,735
What

1426
01:05:58,527 --> 01:06:00,319
Said it was 18% yesterday

1427
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:01,343
Flights from China

1428
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:05,183
Clippers of bottled massive b******* got to disentangle a little bit

1429
01:06:05,951 --> 01:06:09,279
Episode

1430
01:06:09,535 --> 01:06:10,047
Doesn't say with

1431
01:06:10,303 --> 01:06:10,815
The Coronavirus

1432
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:12,351
Is a 15% mortality rate

1433
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:13,887
Just among the 41-page

1434
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:15,679
Since I work in their sample set came from

1435
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:17,983
People who had pneumonia and tester

1436
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:19,263
Two positive for the virus

1437
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:20,543
They had 250

1438
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:21,567
Mortality rate

1439
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:24,639
That's not applicable to the general population in anyway

1440
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:30,271
It's good that Alex doesn't believe that there's a 15% mortality rate but it's super dishonest acclaimed Atlanta to sing

1441
01:06:31,295 --> 01:06:34,879
Second Alex is saying that this lab with Resident Evil logo is the lab

1442
01:06:35,135 --> 01:06:36,671
Tom Cotton is mentioning in

1443
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:37,695
It's not

1444
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:40,511
There's a lie being spread to make the

1445
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:41,279
Suspicious

1446
01:06:41,535 --> 01:06:42,047
The source of the out

1447
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:46,143
Alex is acting like it's weird the Derby a big bio lab in Wuhan

1448
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:47,935
Come on

1449
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:49,983
It's a city of 11 million people

1450
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:53,055
It's not like it's some kind of a rural spot would be weird

1451
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:54,847
It makes total sense

1452
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:55,615
But it's there

1453
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:58,431
And no matter how many times he implies it

1454
01:06:58,687 --> 01:07:02,015
That lab is not the same one as the one in Shanghai which probably doesn't even have

1455
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:07,647
Third coronavirus was not stolen from a lab in Winnipeg in Canada and Central

1456
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:11,487
This is a light went around a right-wing media based on a CBC report

1457
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:12,511
It did not say

1458
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:13,279
Even close to that

1459
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:18,911
She hears all this getting muddled up in mixed together to form some kind of a unified

1460
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:19,679
Conspiracy

1461
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:21,215
It's not true

1462
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:24,031
The scientist Coronavirus

1463
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:24,799
And

1464
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:27,615
It's not true that this lab with the Resident Evil logo is in Wuhan

1465
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:29,663
When you combine them

1466
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:33,759
It's now true that a Canadian scientist that coronavirus to the Umbrella Corporation

1467
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:36,319
Can't you see how that works it's pretty quick

1468
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:39,135
Combine form unified theory

1469
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:40,927
Also I said

1470
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:43,231
That he thinks

1471
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:45,791
When he said he doesn't think that it's 50

1472
01:07:46,047 --> 01:07:46,559
10%

1473
01:07:48,095 --> 01:07:49,119
Think he means that it's

1474
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:51,167
I don't I don't think so

1475
01:07:51,423 --> 01:07:55,263
Lower

1476
01:07:55,775 --> 01:07:57,055
W interpretation

1477
01:07:57,567 --> 01:07:58,335
Much like the Bible

1478
01:07:58,591 --> 01:08:01,919
As for what Tom Cotton was saying In that clip it's fair to say that it's

1479
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:02,943
Still unclear

1480
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:04,735
Exactly where the coronavirus came from

1481
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:10,623
Initially there seems to be a trend that a lot of patients had exposure to that seafood market so to quote Lancet quote

1482
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:13,183
Exposure history to the Hunan Hunan

1483
01:08:13,695 --> 01:08:15,487
Seafood market wholesale Market

1484
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:17,535
Served as an important clue is at

1485
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:18,559
The early stages

1486
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:19,583
Yeah its value has

1487
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:21,887
Decreased as more secondary and tertiary cases have

1488
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:22,655
Have a

1489
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:23,935
Nose means what

1490
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:24,703
Wanted to me

1491
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:26,495
He's playing this clip to imply that

1492
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:28,543
The seafood market was a red herring it was.

1493
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:31,359
Deployed and that the lab must be the source of the out

1494
01:08:31,871 --> 01:08:32,383
But nonetheless

1495
01:08:32,639 --> 01:08:34,175
Substantiated outside of Alex's gas

1496
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:35,455
Implication

1497
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:36,735
Kittens that are not

1498
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:42,623
Stop believing people for competence

1499
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:44,927
That's what they

1500
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:50,303
We're like oh well we saw a bunch of people go to this market so our first thought was let's look into the mar

1501
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:54,911
And then we found out that it wasn't the market so now our thought is let's find the other thing

1502
01:08:56,191 --> 01:08:57,471
That's called doing your due diligence

1503
01:08:57,727 --> 01:08:58,239
It is

1504
01:08:58,495 --> 01:08:59,263
Add stop

1505
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:00,287
Thinking that

1506
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:01,567
Trails

1507
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:06,431
The people go down that don't turn out to be correct are a cover-up

1508
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:08,223
Stop

1509
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:14,623
Thinking of memes meaning

1510
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:15,903
You can see the opposites

1511
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:18,463
Trying to hear they're trying to keep

1512
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:19,999
From interviewing people

1513
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:23,071
And seeing though and maybe going down the ramp

1514
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:24,351
Yeah yeah yeah

1515
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:25,887
So

1516
01:09:27,423 --> 01:09:28,959
The voice-over was the big brag

1517
01:09:29,727 --> 01:09:33,311
The Umbrella Corporation ship was the kind of fun goofy stupid

1518
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:35,615
Right now let's get now we get to the annoying

1519
01:09:36,127 --> 01:09:37,151
Alex's mother Gaston

1520
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:38,175
On the show

1521
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:39,711
If you see something

1522
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:40,479
No don't

1523
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:50,719
Last night with all the stuff going on

1524
01:09:51,743 --> 01:09:53,023
Coffee get a shower

1525
01:09:53,535 --> 01:09:54,559
When walked around

1526
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:56,607
Local golf courses next door

1527
01:09:57,119 --> 01:09:59,935
What am I 5 a.m. and sat down

1528
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:00,703
Dad

1529
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:01,983
10 of a cup of coffee and I

1530
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:06,335
Infowars.com and sauce but I like yet last night

1531
01:10:08,383 --> 01:10:10,431
I don't have 45 minutes to wash

1532
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:12,991
I watched it

1533
01:10:13,759 --> 01:10:14,271
Add

1534
01:10:19,903 --> 01:10:21,183
Because what an illustration

1535
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:22,207
Everybody

1536
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:29,375
I'm going to take on the impeachment trial

1537
01:10:29,631 --> 01:10:30,911
The virus first in this segment

1538
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:33,983
Comeback

1539
01:10:35,007 --> 01:10:35,519
But I mean

1540
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:41,407
Describe how these

1541
01:10:41,663 --> 01:10:42,431
Senior

1542
01:10:42,943 --> 01:10:45,503
Campbell Federal police now attach another Federal group

1543
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:47,551
Veteran

1544
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:49,855
World mounties in their suits

1545
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:58,303
Like something out of a movie about the old Soviet Union or Nazi Germany I mean

1546
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:04,703
Anderson

1547
01:11:07,007 --> 01:11:13,151
I watch this

1548
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:20,063
I'm coming like 6:30 I'm making breakfast

1549
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:21,343
Everyone see who it is

1550
01:11:21,855 --> 01:11:23,391
So it looks like as a revamped

1551
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:24,927
It's going to be a much more frequent

1552
01:11:25,183 --> 01:11:27,487
Presents on Alex's show

1553
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:30,047
Stick together

1554
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:30,815
Guitar

1555
01:11:31,071 --> 01:11:35,167
Remember Ezra Levant is the guy runs Rebel media which

1556
01:11:35,423 --> 01:11:36,191
Employed

1557
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:37,215
Of the

1558
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:43,615
Real dickholes Lauren Southern Katie Hopkins Tommy Robinson

1559
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:44,639
Gavin McInnes

1560
01:11:44,895 --> 01:11:45,919
Salty's real

1561
01:11:46,175 --> 01:11:47,199
Cool

1562
01:11:47,455 --> 01:11:49,247
People also Alex that Golf Course

1563
01:11:49,759 --> 01:11:50,271
Private

1564
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:51,807
You should walking

1565
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:56,671
There's a lot that's interesting about this clip and I'd probably explain what the conscious

1566
01:11:56,927 --> 01:11:59,999
Texted think it's most important takeaway

1567
01:12:00,255 --> 01:12:01,535
I think is it Alex.

1568
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:02,303
Caught up

1569
01:12:02,559 --> 01:12:04,607
Spending hours reading YouTube,

1570
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:09,215
He's a forty-five-year-old man who pretends he does real research it somehow

1571
01:12:09,471 --> 01:12:13,567
Feels like YouTube comments or in any way a barometer of Truth or public opinion

1572
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:16,639
That would legit be like me saying like

1573
01:12:16,895 --> 01:12:18,175
Something Trump did was bad

1574
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:21,503
Sing that I read a bunch of Twitter responses as proof of it

1575
01:12:22,015 --> 01:12:24,575
Still trying to maintain that I was at all a serious person

1576
01:12:25,087 --> 01:12:27,647
This is f****** sad

1577
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:31,743
Also super important point we don't bring up enough

1578
01:12:32,255 --> 01:12:36,351
Alex gets up in the morning and checks out the news on his own website

1579
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:40,447
He's getting the news from people he pays to come up with b*******

1580
01:12:40,959 --> 01:12:43,519
This is the very definition of a vicious cycle

1581
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:46,847
Idiots post dumb s*** on Alex's site then he reads it

1582
01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:47,615
And gets mad about

1583
01:12:48,127 --> 01:12:49,663
It's just such a lame way to live

1584
01:12:50,175 --> 01:12:51,967
And no amount of walking around a golf course

1585
01:12:52,223 --> 01:12:53,247
Justifies that kind of

1586
01:12:55,551 --> 01:12:56,831
That doesn't make up for it it's still very

1587
01:12:57,087 --> 01:13:00,415
Kelly was fighting to keep Infowars awake

1588
01:13:01,695 --> 01:13:05,791
I imagine we should get a John Kelly to keep Infowars away from Alex

1589
01:13:06,559 --> 01:13:07,839
Is that a tribute

1590
01:13:08,095 --> 01:13:10,655
As for Ezra I don't really care about his situation

1591
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:12,447
It's very clear what's going on

1592
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:13,215
And all this

1593
01:13:13,983 --> 01:13:15,519
What it is it has all the making

1594
01:13:15,775 --> 01:13:17,311
Kings of a perfect right-wing victimhood

1595
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:19,103
But it's just based on nothing

1596
01:13:20,127 --> 01:13:21,151
So the situation is this

1597
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:22,687
Ever released

1598
01:13:22,943 --> 01:13:23,967
The book called

1599
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:25,503
Toronto

1600
01:13:25,759 --> 01:13:26,527
LeBron

1601
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:28,319
It's like liberal by like with

1602
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:31,135
Sopranos at the portmanteau

1603
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:34,463
Lubrano's liberanos

1604
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:35,999
Anyway it's about Justice

1605
01:13:36,255 --> 01:13:37,023
Trudeau being corrupt

1606
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:38,303
New releases book bacon

1607
01:13:38,559 --> 01:13:39,839
September 2019

1608
01:13:40,607 --> 01:13:41,887
You barely call this thing a book

1609
01:13:42,143 --> 01:13:43,167
It's 124 page

1610
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:45,727
So in the world of political expose

1611
01:13:45,983 --> 01:13:46,495
Prettymuchit

1612
01:13:47,263 --> 01:13:48,287
Ronan Farrow didn't

1613
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:51,871
Consult on this one did not I'm surprised regardless this was a problem

1614
01:13:52,383 --> 01:13:54,175
Because according to the Canadian elections

1615
01:13:54,687 --> 01:13:56,735
What he did may have been a violation of elect

1616
01:13:57,759 --> 01:14:00,319
According to the letter that Ezra posted on his website

1617
01:14:00,831 --> 01:14:01,343
30 God

1618
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:07,999
The commissioner of Canadian election sent a letter saying quote the allegations are there Rebel news

1619
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:08,767
Contravene.

1620
01:14:09,023 --> 01:14:09,535
By 1

1621
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:13,375
Failing to include the required information on third party election advertised

1622
01:14:13,631 --> 01:14:14,399
N2

1623
01:14:14,655 --> 01:14:17,983
Having incurred over $500 in election advertising expenses

1624
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:21,823
To register as a third party in the general election

1625
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:24,383
To break it down the allegation is

1626
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:25,663
Date at the buck

1627
01:14:26,175 --> 01:14:27,711
And the

1628
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:28,735
The marketing of

1629
01:14:28,991 --> 01:14:31,039
The Bucs amounted to political advertising

1630
01:14:31,295 --> 01:14:32,575
Against a candidate

1631
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:37,183
In order to publish such materials in Canada you have to register as a third-party election

1632
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:38,975
Advertise a manta ray

1633
01:14:39,231 --> 01:14:39,999
That's that's

1634
01:14:40,255 --> 01:14:41,791
Smart and kind of keeps

1635
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:44,863
Should hold him from doing stuff like that right

1636
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:47,167
When it comes to the publication of the book

1637
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:49,727
Chicken Lily relevant whether or not the book

1638
01:14:49,983 --> 01:14:50,751
Plan to be published

1639
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:52,799
Whether or not there was an election

1640
01:14:53,311 --> 01:14:55,103
That's the central question

1641
01:14:55,359 --> 01:14:56,127
And the answer is

1642
01:14:57,663 --> 01:15:00,991
And this seems to be one of the central questions of why this letter was sent

1643
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:03,807
Informal event that an investigation was being open

1644
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:10,463
Something it's probably not working in lavance favor is that there is a clip of him that's referenced in his interview

1645
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:11,999
View with these investigators

1646
01:15:12,255 --> 01:15:14,559
Where you specifically said that he wanted to get the book out for the

1647
01:15:14,815 --> 01:15:15,327
The election

1648
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:19,423
That makes it kind of clear that he was trying to do election advertising with the book

1649
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:20,191
Right

1650
01:15:20,447 --> 01:15:26,591
Regardless this is a polite letter it informs him that

1651
01:15:26,847 --> 01:15:27,359
Operate or not

1652
01:15:27,615 --> 01:15:30,687
And if you'd like he's invited to schedule an interview with the

1653
01:15:31,967 --> 01:15:32,479
Anyway

1654
01:15:32,735 --> 01:15:34,527
That letter was sent on December 9th

1655
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:37,599
2019 apparently Levant just had that interview

1656
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:43,999
Because he snuck a hidden camera in and recorded himself no badgering the interviewer

1657
01:15:45,023 --> 01:15:46,303
Jack is a really sad look

1658
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:52,703
But it's exactly the performance you need to really get that conservative victim of juice flowing and I can see why

1659
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:54,239
* it would be like practice

1660
01:15:55,263 --> 01:15:56,287
I watch the whole video

1661
01:15:56,543 --> 01:15:57,055
It's annoying

1662
01:15:57,311 --> 01:15:59,615
Another one that comes off like a scam artist baby

1663
01:16:00,127 --> 01:16:01,663
But also he seems to be editing

1664
01:16:01,919 --> 01:16:03,711
Obscure an element

1665
01:16:03,967 --> 01:16:04,479
Into the case

1666
01:16:05,247 --> 01:16:06,271
It seems like the interviews

1667
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:09,599
Viewers are less interested in the publishing of the book

1668
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:12,415
And more interested in the advertising of

1669
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:15,487
If you write a book about your well-being

1670
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:17,279
Then advertise it with a

1671
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:19,327
A ton of signs and posters everywhere

1672
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:22,911
With Trudeau stylized as The Sopranos DVD cover

1673
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:25,983
It's going to be indistinguishable from a flyer posted by a

1674
01:16:26,495 --> 01:16:27,007
Political party

1675
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:29,311
That seems to be where their interests lie

1676
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:30,847
In how the fact

1677
01:16:31,103 --> 01:16:32,127
That you wanted to

1678
01:16:32,383 --> 01:16:33,407
Get the book out before the election

1679
01:16:33,919 --> 01:16:34,687
And that is advertising

1680
01:16:34,943 --> 01:16:36,479
Materials were basically political average

1681
01:16:37,503 --> 01:16:40,831
That's the vibe that I get from their question

1682
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:41,855
Position

1683
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:42,623
Trying to defend

1684
01:16:42,879 --> 01:16:43,647
Himself because

1685
01:16:43,903 --> 01:16:45,695
Based on the way they act as written

1686
01:16:46,207 --> 01:16:47,487
It's pretty clear that he's gone forever

1687
01:16:49,023 --> 01:16:52,863
The bottom line is that there is a law that Levante is very likely in violation

1688
01:16:53,887 --> 01:16:56,191
It's a law that sound weird to American years perhaps

1689
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:58,239
What is part of the Canadian election law

1690
01:16:58,495 --> 01:16:59,263
And he has every reason

1691
01:16:59,519 --> 01:17:00,031
To know that

1692
01:17:00,287 --> 01:17:04,639
All you really need to know if you want to understand this is to watch the first two minutes

1693
01:17:04,895 --> 01:17:06,431
The video that you put out and now it's wash

1694
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:10,271
It's kind of a Sizzle reel of him sassing the interviewer

1695
01:17:10,783 --> 01:17:11,295
Then

1696
01:17:11,551 --> 01:17:12,319
You get Levant talk

1697
01:17:12,575 --> 01:17:15,391
Control camera and he tells people that if they want to read the letter

1698
01:17:15,647 --> 01:17:16,415
The elections board

1699
01:17:17,183 --> 01:17:19,487
They have to go to save Rebel news.com

1700
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:21,791
This website is just a

1701
01:17:22,047 --> 01:17:22,559
The fundraising

1702
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:25,631
The top link is for people to send him Bitcoin

1703
01:17:26,143 --> 01:17:26,911
It's all just

1704
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:27,935
Trudeau is trying

1705
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:29,727
Take me down and then

1706
01:17:30,751 --> 01:17:33,823
There's no way I could pay our Free Speech legal fees without

1707
01:17:34,079 --> 01:17:36,383
The help of you and thousands of other supporters like you

1708
01:17:36,895 --> 01:17:41,247
So if you use the form below you can chip in whether it's $10 a hundred dollars or even more

1709
01:17:41,759 --> 01:17:43,295
Man I can't imagine somebody

1710
01:17:43,551 --> 01:17:46,111
Sending him Bitcoin that's like one Bitcoin is like

1711
01:17:46,367 --> 01:17:47,135
3 Grant still

1712
01:17:47,391 --> 01:17:49,695
Exactly

1713
01:17:49,951 --> 01:17:50,975
This entire website

1714
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:53,535
Built around a video Alex's promoted

1715
01:17:53,791 --> 01:17:55,071
Irrelevant being a baby in

1716
01:17:55,839 --> 01:18:01,215
It's specifically about raising money for some imaginary free-speech standees taken against Justin Trudeau

1717
01:18:01,471 --> 01:18:02,239
This is Tex

1718
01:18:02,495 --> 01:18:04,031
Book free speech grifting if there's ever been

1719
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:04,799
Open a case

1720
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:07,615
It looks like he's guilty of violating election

1721
01:18:08,127 --> 01:18:10,943
You've been warned that there might be a penalty for his actions

1722
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:13,759
So instead of trying to start a movement to change this law

1723
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:15,295
He's fundraising about his

1724
01:18:15,551 --> 01:18:16,063
Quite

1725
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:19,135
Overturning that law seems like a really dumb idea because I

1726
01:18:19,391 --> 01:18:20,415
Any billionaire

1727
01:18:20,671 --> 01:18:22,463
Going to get around to like election regulations

1728
01:18:22,975 --> 01:18:23,743
Just put out a half cooked

1729
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:26,559
124-page book to use it as an

1730
01:18:26,815 --> 01:18:27,583
Excuse

1731
01:18:27,839 --> 01:18:30,655
Ton of unregulated election materials masquerading as bookcase

1732
01:18:30,911 --> 01:18:31,679
How bad it's

1733
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:34,239
Seems like regulation is really a good thing in the sea

1734
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:37,055
Isn't it

1735
01:18:37,311 --> 01:18:38,847
We've seen in America what

1736
01:18:39,359 --> 01:18:40,383
The consequences are

1737
01:18:40,639 --> 01:18:46,783
Loosening up fees

1738
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:47,551
Little titty baby

1739
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:49,855
Zero interest in his self agreement

1740
01:18:50,623 --> 01:18:53,439
It is 1:35 about this interview that he had with the

1741
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:54,719
Since people yes for money

1742
01:18:54,975 --> 01:18:55,999
At least six times

1743
01:18:56,511 --> 01:18:58,559
It's very clear he's treating this like a publicity

1744
01:18:58,815 --> 01:19:04,447
Restart ultimately going to get hit with a nominal fine probably I would guess based on the assessment I can

1745
01:19:04,703 --> 01:19:05,727
Can see you the situation

1746
01:19:06,751 --> 01:19:08,799
He's going to raise so much more money

1747
01:19:09,055 --> 01:19:11,103
Based on riling up conservative persecution

1748
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:13,919
And feelings that's the entire play that's being done

1749
01:19:15,455 --> 01:19:15,967
Can't we just

1750
01:19:16,735 --> 01:19:17,247
Campaign

1751
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:18,015
Take that

1752
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:20,831
Take the money that he raises

1753
01:19:21,087 --> 01:19:21,855
As the fight

1754
01:19:22,111 --> 01:19:28,255
Stop just all of it just hears your fine however much money you raised from this dumb website I wonder because

1755
01:19:28,767 --> 01:19:31,327
Is 50 Bitcoin

1756
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:33,119
I wonder what the case is because

1757
01:19:33,375 --> 01:19:34,655
I think

1758
01:19:34,911 --> 01:19:36,959
Probably some of his actions might

1759
01:19:38,751 --> 01:19:41,055
Yeah they're hurting his case

1760
01:19:41,311 --> 01:19:42,591
At least Big D definitely into

1761
01:19:42,847 --> 01:19:44,639
Malicious intent

1762
01:19:44,895 --> 01:19:46,943
Absolutely I don't know how those things

1763
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:48,223
Kingswood implicate

1764
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:49,247
The actual case

1765
01:19:50,015 --> 01:19:50,783
I mean

1766
01:19:51,039 --> 01:19:54,367
I think based on just the information that's available from

1767
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:55,903
He is edited video

1768
01:19:56,415 --> 01:19:57,439
The investigators have

1769
01:19:57,951 --> 01:20:00,255
Evidence that he's indicated he wanted to get the book

1770
01:20:01,791 --> 01:20:03,327
And that makes it so

1771
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:06,143
This is political advertising which is against

1772
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:07,167
The Canada election

1773
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:09,215
Pretty open

1774
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:11,519
I know but as we know now.

1775
01:20:11,775 --> 01:20:17,920
Just because you go on TV and admit that you committed a crime doesn't mean that you can be punished for that

1776
01:20:18,176 --> 01:20:19,200
That crime or even

1777
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:22,016
Except responsibility for it at all it's upsetting

1778
01:20:22,272 --> 01:20:24,832
The idea that he would be able to just walk

1779
01:20:25,088 --> 01:20:26,880
Through this with no consequences

1780
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:27,648
You very well by

1781
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:29,952
Well it is Canada though so they might give him

1782
01:20:30,464 --> 01:20:31,744
You say it's Canada

1783
01:20:32,256 --> 01:20:34,560
Alex says it's America

1784
01:20:35,072 --> 01:20:36,352
Text Flip

1785
01:20:36,608 --> 01:20:38,912
Is talking about Ezra Levant flight

1786
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:41,216
Any accidentally says that this is America

1787
01:20:41,728 --> 01:20:45,568
You watch they're going to charge and you can smell it they say you're guilty

1788
01:20:45,824 --> 01:20:49,664
You want to walk that back if you're guilty of writing a book during an election

1789
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:52,992
Lawyer

1790
01:20:55,552 --> 01:20:56,576
You're going to jail

1791
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:58,624
This is America

1792
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:02,976
Block somebody

1793
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:04,768
Play smoking weed

1794
01:21:08,352 --> 01:21:14,496
It's believed that American sovereignty extends to White right wing assholes

1795
01:21:14,752 --> 01:21:16,544
Another country

1796
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:22,688
If you're if you're a white right-wing a****** you are a citizen of Alex's United States I guess so

1797
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:25,248
Also that letter that has received from the election

1798
01:21:25,504 --> 01:21:28,064
Commissioner was very explicit that this is not a criminal matter

1799
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:30,624
From the letter

1800
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:34,720
The fact that the Commissioners decided to proceed by way of an administrative invest

1801
01:21:35,232 --> 01:21:38,304
Can indicate that he is of the view that this is a matter best dealt with

1802
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:41,120
Administrative leave rather than by way of a criminal

1803
01:21:41,888 --> 01:21:44,704
There's no intention to charge Ezra Levant with cryamore

1804
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:45,728
Charge him

1805
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:46,752
Burlington prison

1806
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:50,592
There's only an intention to sort out whether or not the advertised

1807
01:21:50,848 --> 01:21:52,128
The campaign surrounding his book

1808
01:21:52,384 --> 01:21:53,152
Was against Alexa

1809
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:58,528
I look I get y as what Levant would make a big deal out of this and it's because he looks really guilty

1810
01:21:59,040 --> 01:21:59,808
And he's a big old baby

1811
01:22:00,064 --> 01:22:00,832
And he's also really

1812
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:10,048
Administrative staff for you

1813
01:22:10,304 --> 01:22:13,632
The law enforcement just does not know how to deal with these guys

1814
01:22:13,888 --> 01:22:20,032
They always get this tiny little well people

1815
01:22:21,568 --> 01:22:26,688
Crime by speaking into a federal building

1816
01:22:27,968 --> 01:22:28,992
They could have done jail time

1817
01:22:29,248 --> 01:22:31,808
Which is what we need to do with these militia

1818
01:22:32,064 --> 01:22:36,672
Just actors if there is any way to punish them in the law to the extent

1819
01:22:36,928 --> 01:22:38,464
That is who should be punished

1820
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:39,232
Introduces

1821
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:40,256
Difficult Quest

1822
01:22:41,024 --> 01:22:41,536
About

1823
01:22:41,792 --> 01:22:43,072
How you deal with

1824
01:22:43,328 --> 01:22:45,376
Like people that you can

1825
01:22:45,632 --> 01:22:48,192
Very intuitively and

1826
01:22:48,448 --> 01:22:51,776
Llano empirical observe our s*******

1827
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:55,872
People are marijuana f*** these guys

1828
01:22:56,128 --> 01:23:02,272
Play Pure against that to you can't use that as a justification

1829
01:23:02,528 --> 01:23:03,296
Difficult

1830
01:23:03,552 --> 01:23:05,088
It's a really hard question like

1831
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:06,880
And I think I keep coming back to

1832
01:23:07,392 --> 01:23:08,160
I think just

1833
01:23:08,672 --> 01:23:11,232
Widespread awareness of these peoples

1834
01:23:11,488 --> 01:23:13,024
Patterns of Deceit

1835
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:14,560
And it had a real

1836
01:23:14,816 --> 01:23:16,608
I think it's probably the only thing

1837
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:17,888
That is

1838
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:18,912
Really

1839
01:23:19,936 --> 01:23:20,704
Powerful against

1840
01:23:21,728 --> 01:23:24,800
Because otherwise wielding the mechanisms of the state

1841
01:23:25,056 --> 01:23:27,104
Become really difficult because then they get

1842
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:28,128
Pretend they're victims of the

1843
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:34,272
Pretending he's a victim of the state just as he got kicked off YouTube

1844
01:23:34,528 --> 01:23:38,624
True you know like they're going to pretend to be victims of the state no matter what

1845
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:41,440
I would say the I would say deplatforming does

1846
01:23:41,952 --> 01:23:43,488
Does it help it does yeah

1847
01:23:43,744 --> 01:23:45,280
Yeah I mean as far as

1848
01:23:45,536 --> 01:23:46,816
Steps to take that

1849
01:23:47,072 --> 01:23:47,840
That's pretty big

1850
01:23:48,096 --> 01:23:51,424
I don't have a prescription for the solution

1851
01:23:51,936 --> 01:23:56,544
I would say that locking people up marijuana compressor

1852
01:23:57,056 --> 01:23:57,824
This guy

1853
01:23:58,336 --> 01:23:59,360
Pendleton store

1854
01:23:59,616 --> 01:24:02,688
I'm with you for the first half if he himself

1855
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:05,760
So Azria get to talkin about how he thinks he's innocent

1856
01:24:07,552 --> 01:24:08,320
I don't

1857
01:24:08,576 --> 01:24:09,344
Know if his defense

1858
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:10,112
Is very good

1859
01:24:10,624 --> 01:24:12,416
Canada election law disaster

1860
01:24:12,928 --> 01:24:13,952
Exemption

1861
01:24:15,744 --> 01:24:16,256
Promotional book

1862
01:24:18,304 --> 01:24:20,864
I've written an almost pembrokeshire

1863
01:24:21,376 --> 01:24:22,656
Camera best sellers

1864
01:24:24,448 --> 01:24:24,960
Where are we

1865
01:24:25,216 --> 01:24:25,728
Under

1866
01:24:27,776 --> 01:24:28,544
Brought me in

1867
01:24:29,056 --> 01:24:32,896
Ezra doesn't seem to understand the issue which that's me being glib

1868
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:35,456
He fully understands the issue but he's pretending not to

1869
01:24:35,712 --> 01:24:40,320
Because if he reveals that he does understand the issue we have to admit that he probably broke

1870
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:42,880
Action laws Alex I've been advised by my lawyers

1871
01:24:43,904 --> 01:24:45,440
Actually actually great work

1872
01:24:45,952 --> 01:24:48,256
To lie directly to your face and your audience

1873
01:24:48,768 --> 01:24:52,352
That exemption are you talkin about that exist for books and advertising the books

1874
01:24:52,608 --> 01:24:53,888
It only exists

1875
01:24:54,144 --> 01:24:57,984
If the book was going to be released whether or not an election was happen

1876
01:24:58,752 --> 01:25:01,312
If the book is specifically released for in the election

1877
01:25:01,568 --> 01:25:07,712
Is Ezra said is true of his own book it is no longer eligible for that Exempted because it easy an Essence and

1878
01:25:07,968 --> 01:25:08,992
Election advertisement

1879
01:25:09,504 --> 01:25:12,320
The aunt that would all be totally fine for him to do that

1880
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:14,880
Can do all these advertisement

1881
01:25:15,136 --> 01:25:21,280
He would just have to register as a third-party political advertising is confiscation

1882
01:25:21,536 --> 01:25:23,072
How to do that either because if he did

1883
01:25:23,328 --> 01:25:28,448
He would then be subject to other election laws about misleading advertisements

1884
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:30,752
Puts out with me then subject to a bunch

1885
01:25:31,008 --> 01:25:32,032
Higher level of scrutiny

1886
01:25:32,288 --> 01:25:33,568
Then it would be otherwise

1887
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:36,896
McDonald's I just want to lie to you

1888
01:25:37,152 --> 01:25:39,200
Why is everybody making this so hard

1889
01:25:39,456 --> 01:25:41,248
This dumb dumb knows the game he's playing

1890
01:25:41,504 --> 01:25:46,880
You can't register the third-party Advertiser without getting hit with a ton of fine for deceptive election advertising

1891
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:49,184
He can't pretend that you would

1892
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:53,792
Have to put the book out whether or not you know those are wasn't because he said he wanted to get it out for the

1893
01:25:54,304 --> 01:25:57,632
And so he's left with the only Refuge there is Con men like him

1894
01:25:57,888 --> 01:26:00,448
Insisting the law says something different than what it says

1895
01:26:01,216 --> 01:26:03,008
There's a particularly difficult peel

1896
01:26:03,264 --> 01:26:06,848
For me to swallow send Edward used to be a practicing lawyer

1897
01:26:07,872 --> 01:26:10,432
You know damn well that accept exemption works

1898
01:26:10,688 --> 01:26:11,200
Good work

1899
01:26:11,456 --> 01:26:17,600
Investigation going as good as action strongly implied that he wasn't eligible for

1900
01:26:17,856 --> 01:26:19,904
For the exemption he's claiming he's covered by

1901
01:26:20,416 --> 01:26:26,560
Alright okay sure you have me on tape murdering that guy but I didn't work

1902
01:26:27,584 --> 01:26:29,120
The statute clearly says

1903
01:26:29,888 --> 01:26:32,192
There's any special exemption for murdering this guy

1904
01:26:32,448 --> 01:26:35,264
What's interesting is that Alex is like trying to defend him when he starts

1905
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:36,544
Rambling real hard

1906
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:37,824
And in his Rambo

1907
01:26:38,336 --> 01:26:39,872
He's clearly saying

1908
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:42,688
California election

1909
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:44,224
Yeah so this is

1910
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:46,272
This is really strange

1911
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:47,808
This is real Taryn

1912
01:26:50,624 --> 01:26:56,512
Have you sold your horse if you're just some citizen or of the group you can publish a book anyway you want

1913
01:26:56,768 --> 01:27:02,912
But if you're a political group and it's a political publication by the party or by third-party is an action group

1914
01:27:03,168 --> 01:27:07,008
Tell him to say yes

1915
01:27:07,264 --> 01:27:08,288
An opt-in

1916
01:27:08,544 --> 01:27:14,688
You're guilty buddy you admit you did no crap Sherlock

1917
01:27:15,456 --> 01:27:21,600
Of course I don't like this piece of garbage and I'm doing this it's my speech alright

1918
01:27:21,856 --> 01:27:23,136
Canada

1919
01:27:23,392 --> 01:27:24,160
Common law

1920
01:27:33,376 --> 01:27:39,520
The standard isn't if you're a political action group as I understand from reading the statute these things out

1921
01:27:39,776 --> 01:27:40,288
Like if you're a web

1922
01:27:40,544 --> 01:27:42,080
Website primarily

1923
01:27:42,336 --> 01:27:43,104
It's size

1924
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:46,944
It's size of website that has the factor if you need to read

1925
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:48,224
Register for this third party

1926
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:50,784
Political advertising designation

1927
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:51,808
And in this case

1928
01:27:52,064 --> 01:27:53,344
I believe it was

1929
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:54,880
The threshold is like

1930
01:27:55,136 --> 01:27:56,160
3 million hit

1931
01:27:56,416 --> 01:27:57,184
If you're in English

1932
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:57,952
Language

1933
01:27:58,208 --> 01:28:00,256
Website which they are above

1934
01:28:00,512 --> 01:28:03,072
Okay well thank your own website

1935
01:28:03,328 --> 01:28:04,608
Dunn Bros song

1936
01:28:04,864 --> 01:28:06,144
Got it isolved

1937
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:11,008
Yeah just be less successful at that you can play all these bullshittin

1938
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:12,032
Open

1939
01:28:12,544 --> 01:28:13,568
Who's your playing was b******* games

1940
01:28:13,824 --> 01:28:18,176
Because you want to make money off that you are

1941
01:28:18,432 --> 01:28:21,248
The problem I think might come from

1942
01:28:21,504 --> 01:28:23,040
Spending your entire life lying about

1943
01:28:23,552 --> 01:28:24,064
Topman

1944
01:28:24,576 --> 01:28:28,672
Anyway ever-lovin baby and I do not care

1945
01:28:28,928 --> 01:28:29,952
To listen to any more of him

1946
01:28:30,208 --> 01:28:30,976
Because this

1947
01:28:31,232 --> 01:28:32,256
This whole thing

1948
01:28:33,024 --> 01:28:33,792
Coughing

1949
01:28:34,304 --> 01:28:36,864
Is just a right-wing aggrievement fantasy

1950
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:37,888
Play doubt

1951
01:28:38,144 --> 01:28:41,472
Perpetuated in order to direct money to Ezra Levant

1952
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:42,240
And it's

1953
01:28:42,496 --> 01:28:45,056
It's pretty obvious the great grips of our time

1954
01:28:45,312 --> 01:28:46,848
It maybe is the best graph

1955
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:51,712
Lying to white people and telling them that they're always under attack and then they give you money

1956
01:28:51,968 --> 01:28:52,992
Stenograph

1957
01:28:53,504 --> 01:28:54,528
Stronger it's not hard

1958
01:28:54,784 --> 01:28:58,112
Another guest coming up that actually leads to one of the

1959
01:28:58,368 --> 01:28:59,136
The funny or moments

1960
01:28:59,392 --> 01:29:01,184
That we've heard in a long time

1961
01:29:02,464 --> 01:29:04,512
But not because of the gas state

1962
01:29:04,768 --> 01:29:06,560
You'll get it later but

1963
01:29:06,816 --> 01:29:07,840
Alex

1964
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:12,192
Sell it

1965
01:29:12,448 --> 01:29:13,728
It's amazing

1966
01:29:13,984 --> 01:29:18,848
I know you got to go we got to go to

1967
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:24,224
Congressman Bob Barr

1968
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:27,040
Couldn't do better on a day like

1969
01:29:27,808 --> 01:29:29,600
The president

1970
01:29:29,856 --> 01:29:33,696
We don't know yet we're tagging shots

1971
01:29:33,952 --> 01:29:36,000
That's the lifeblood

1972
01:29:36,512 --> 01:29:37,280
Daddy

1973
01:29:37,536 --> 01:29:39,328
Aspirate

1974
01:29:39,584 --> 01:29:43,936
First of all like I haven't read a book need to sell it

1975
01:29:44,704 --> 01:29:50,848
Hey we got Bob bar coming on he started Clinton impeachment what a great things shots fired at Mar-A-Lago

1976
01:29:51,104 --> 01:29:51,616
Argo

1977
01:29:51,872 --> 01:29:53,664
Speaking of fun day forecast

1978
01:29:56,224 --> 01:30:00,064
So Alex talking about how like you had a realization

1979
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:01,088
About the global

1980
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:02,368
Okay

1981
01:30:02,624 --> 01:30:03,904
Many years in

1982
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:05,184
This is not a real

1983
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:07,488
This is basically just Alex

1984
01:30:08,256 --> 01:30:09,792
Killin Time

1985
01:30:10,816 --> 01:30:16,960
Blown Away by how evil the Deep state is and how sick they are and how filthy they are and how wide

1986
01:30:21,568 --> 01:30:23,616
These people have been waiting for a long time

1987
01:30:24,896 --> 01:30:25,664
They have been

1988
01:30:30,272 --> 01:30:32,320
Absolutely dominating us and so

1989
01:30:32,832 --> 01:30:33,856
That makes me feel

1990
01:30:34,112 --> 01:30:34,880
Like a wimp

1991
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:40,512
Allison I can lay down and again I'm in a lot of guys and kick my ass okay

1992
01:30:41,024 --> 01:30:43,072
But I remember being at like a little kid

1993
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:45,888
And getting off the bus in like sixth grade

1994
01:30:46,656 --> 01:30:50,496
Fifth grade and beat me up.

1995
01:30:52,544 --> 01:30:53,824
Until that moment when

1996
01:30:54,336 --> 01:31:00,480
You looked at me weird cuz he said he missed 3 years older older

1997
01:31:02,784 --> 01:31:08,928
Thatskannada that is Infowars 10 years older

1998
01:31:09,184 --> 01:31:11,744
Toddler he just can't speak you met older

1999
01:31:13,536 --> 01:31:14,560
That moment when

2000
01:31:21,984 --> 01:31:23,264
Technically almost killed a guy

2001
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:29,920
They don't have the Killer Instinct folks we do

2002
01:31:34,528 --> 01:31:35,040
We got it

2003
01:31:35,552 --> 01:31:37,600
What voltage we need God will give it to us

2004
01:31:37,856 --> 01:31:40,928
God will allow me to use this rock to put your eye I'll kill you

2005
01:31:41,184 --> 01:31:42,976
Because God gives me that's true

2006
01:31:43,232 --> 01:31:49,376
Like the later stages of this episode there is more of him just get

2007
01:31:49,632 --> 01:31:50,400
Getting lost in thought

2008
01:31:50,912 --> 01:31:56,544
I'm stealing time at nothing because he doesn't really even bring up

2009
01:31:57,056 --> 01:31:59,360
I know who rented takes effect in the

2010
01:32:00,896 --> 01:32:01,408
The day

2011
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:03,456
It's going to happen

2012
01:32:03,712 --> 01:32:05,504
Forever

2013
01:32:10,624 --> 01:32:12,160
Broad got what he wanted and now he is

2014
01:32:12,416 --> 01:32:12,928
Is God

2015
01:32:13,184 --> 01:32:14,976
What do you get Tommy Robinson on

2016
01:32:17,536 --> 01:32:18,560
Countdown

2017
01:32:18,816 --> 01:32:20,608
Thank you Lord thank you Luis busy

2018
01:32:20,864 --> 01:32:27,008
She doesn't have time for a small show like Infowars because I don't I don't know well it's good from the UK any

2019
01:32:27,264 --> 01:32:28,032
Anymore

2020
01:32:29,568 --> 01:32:30,080
But I still

2021
01:32:30,336 --> 01:32:31,104
Think the dankila is not

2022
01:32:34,944 --> 01:32:38,528
I'm going to need you to back up your your,

2023
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:39,808
But

2024
01:32:40,576 --> 01:32:41,088
Alex

2025
01:32:42,624 --> 01:32:43,648
I don't know anyway

2026
01:32:43,904 --> 01:32:45,440
Bob Barr is coming on

2027
01:32:45,696 --> 01:32:46,464
Do you come home later

2028
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:49,280
King of the elephants

2029
01:32:49,792 --> 01:32:53,120
Rollie with any clubs in cuz it's just yelling about the Deep state

2030
01:32:53,376 --> 01:32:54,144
But

2031
01:32:54,656 --> 01:32:55,424
It turns out

2032
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:59,520
Alex did not mean to book Bob

2033
01:33:00,544 --> 01:33:02,080
It was an accidental bucket

2034
01:33:02,336 --> 01:33:04,896
A lot of calls today we got Bob bar

2035
01:33:05,408 --> 01:33:07,712
Actually initiated impeachment against Bill Clinton

2036
01:33:07,968 --> 01:33:09,504
I couldn't think of a better

2037
01:33:11,808 --> 01:33:14,112
Gaston this whole constellation of news only

2038
01:33:14,624 --> 01:33:16,160
Robert Barnes back on as well

2039
01:33:21,024 --> 01:33:22,048
Marble CO

2040
01:33:35,104 --> 01:33:37,920
You should have thought of that we should get them on each

2041
01:33:41,248 --> 01:33:43,296
Got punished weather

2042
01:33:47,136 --> 01:33:52,512
Barnes is so busy now and coincidence

2043
01:33:52,768 --> 01:33:58,656
For you we got real busy is really wild busy shows the specific time to get very busy

2044
01:33:58,912 --> 01:34:01,472
Why would I do my show it's always

2045
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:04,288
That used to be on

2046
01:34:04,544 --> 01:34:06,336
All the f****** time when I was in

2047
01:34:06,592 --> 01:34:07,360
Employing him

2048
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:14,784
He had no intention of winning any of those lawsuits and he was just charging me a lot for the hour

2049
01:34:15,296 --> 01:34:16,576
Exposure

2050
01:34:16,832 --> 01:34:19,136
I think that might be

2051
01:34:19,392 --> 01:34:20,672
I might have been

2052
01:34:20,928 --> 01:34:21,952
F******

2053
01:34:22,464 --> 01:34:25,792
Nigerian scammed Again by

2054
01:34:27,584 --> 01:34:29,376
Not going to come back on the show

2055
01:34:29,632 --> 01:34:30,400
Not being paid

2056
01:34:30,656 --> 01:34:32,192
No he's not going to do it

2057
01:34:32,704 --> 01:34:33,216
What is

2058
01:34:33,472 --> 01:34:36,032
If we give Bob bars pretend we miss murder

2059
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:42,944
Let's put that of all the names to miss here

2060
01:34:44,736 --> 01:34:45,760
Very very

2061
01:34:46,272 --> 01:34:49,088
So I said I don't care about Bob bars

2062
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:50,368
It's it's meaningless

2063
01:34:51,136 --> 01:34:52,160
By Alex

2064
01:34:52,416 --> 01:34:53,184
Get back to

2065
01:34:54,464 --> 01:34:54,976
Talking about the

2066
01:34:55,232 --> 01:34:56,256
The coronavirus situation

2067
01:34:57,024 --> 01:34:57,792
He wants you to know

2068
01:34:58,048 --> 01:34:59,584
That's a very good product

2069
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:00,352
I'm sure

2070
01:35:00,608 --> 01:35:01,120
For this

2071
01:35:01,376 --> 01:35:02,400
And

2072
01:35:02,656 --> 01:35:04,192
I think he's a dancing

2073
01:35:04,448 --> 01:35:08,544
Real close you can't say that there preventative

2074
01:35:09,056 --> 01:35:09,568
Right

2075
01:35:12,896 --> 01:35:14,688
I'm not sure it's this virus

2076
01:35:15,456 --> 01:35:15,968
But

2077
01:35:17,248 --> 01:35:18,528
You have our bases covered

2078
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:19,808
Damaris

2079
01:35:21,344 --> 01:35:25,440
I said I would talk about this person such big knows I'm going to break them up with gas, do it right now

2080
01:35:26,208 --> 01:35:28,768
Because it's important decision for all you out there to think about

2081
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:30,560
And it is going to do

2082
01:35:31,072 --> 01:35:33,888
Tell you something that I've been authorized

2083
01:35:35,936 --> 01:35:36,960
It's just I can Congress

2084
01:35:37,984 --> 01:35:39,776
This is 13 years ago

2085
01:35:41,312 --> 01:35:42,336
And this is the company

2086
01:35:43,616 --> 01:35:45,664
I got this information for my days ago I said

2087
01:35:46,176 --> 01:35:47,200
Listen

2088
01:35:49,248 --> 01:35:54,112
Are you sure you want me to do this because you got Department defense contracts yellow others

2089
01:35:54,624 --> 01:36:00,256
Did I mess with him I don't know where the owners we would be like what you're doing we got a partial you would want people to know

2090
01:36:00,512 --> 01:36:02,560
Department of Defense

2091
01:36:03,072 --> 01:36:04,864
A congressional report say that

2092
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:06,656
This product nanosilver

2093
01:36:07,168 --> 01:36:08,704
Confounded knockout Stars

2094
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:10,496
Well no crap no

2095
01:36:10,752 --> 01:36:11,520
No

2096
01:36:11,776 --> 01:36:12,544
No

2097
01:36:13,056 --> 01:36:14,336
No

2098
01:36:14,848 --> 01:36:17,408
Nobody selling 16 oz of nanosilver

2099
01:36:23,808 --> 01:36:24,832
Ridiculous names

2100
01:36:25,088 --> 01:36:28,160
Medical name you can you can drink it all

2101
01:36:30,208 --> 01:36:32,768
My dad is an oral surgeon a dentist named it so

2102
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:39,424
Call Garland

2103
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:46,848
Start he's dancing around this

2104
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:49,920
Silver has been found

2105
01:36:50,432 --> 01:36:50,944
2

2106
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:52,992
Kill bacteria in water

2107
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:57,856
Nano silver has not been found to kills it's not entirely

2108
01:36:58,112 --> 01:36:58,624
Fair

2109
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:05,024
But the point is that these this ad could be a problem for Alex even if the claims that he's making about nanosilver r

2110
01:37:05,536 --> 01:37:06,304
Substantiated

2111
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:07,840
Not like it doesn't really matter

2112
01:37:08,352 --> 01:37:10,144
From the limited amount of scientific research

2113
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:16,544
I'm able to do it does seem like there have been some studies that have shown some indications that Nano metals have potential with Viber

2114
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:17,824
Viruses and bacteria

2115
01:37:18,336 --> 01:37:20,128
But that isn't the part to be concerned

2116
01:37:20,640 --> 01:37:23,712
It's a fact that he's selling the nanosilver product in the way he is

2117
01:37:24,224 --> 01:37:25,504
Bike directly linking it

2118
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:29,344
And that click and later you going to with Coronavirus

2119
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:34,720
In 2014 Dr Rima laibow former Alex Jones Gaston wife

2120
01:37:34,976 --> 01:37:36,000
General stubblebine

2121
01:37:36,256 --> 01:37:42,400
Received a letter from the FDA and the Department of Health and Human Services warning her that the way that she was selling her nanosilver

2122
01:37:43,168 --> 01:37:43,680
The problem

2123
01:37:44,192 --> 01:37:46,496
She was promoting the silver in a way that was understood to be

2124
01:37:46,752 --> 01:37:50,848
Bee quote for using the Cure medication treatment or prevention of disease

2125
01:37:51,104 --> 01:37:53,408
And because of that she was no longer selling ass up

2126
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:54,944
She was selling a drug

2127
01:37:55,456 --> 01:37:57,248
And as it turns out there are different rules

2128
01:37:57,760 --> 01:37:58,528
About how you can sell drugs

2129
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:00,832
Particularly as it relates to Interstate

2130
01:38:01,088 --> 01:38:01,600
Commerce

2131
01:38:01,856 --> 01:38:02,624
When you do

2132
01:38:03,392 --> 01:38:06,208
This letter was sent to her during the time when Ebola

2133
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:07,744
Hot virus on the scene

2134
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:08,768
The medical scammers

2135
01:38:09,024 --> 01:38:10,816
So she was pitching it as any Bowlarama

2136
01:38:11,584 --> 01:38:17,728
Enter sales pitches you mentioned that very similar sounding release from the Department of Defense though she says it was from 2009

2137
01:38:19,008 --> 01:38:19,520
The timeline

2138
01:38:19,776 --> 01:38:22,592
To make sure that 13 years ago. 7

2139
01:38:23,104 --> 01:38:28,480
It's important to recognize that it's immaterial if Alex thinks his claims that he's making are backed by a study

2140
01:38:28,992 --> 01:38:30,784
This is an issue of what he's

2141
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:31,552
Required to do

2142
01:38:31,808 --> 01:38:32,320
If you sell it

2143
01:38:32,576 --> 01:38:33,088
The drug

2144
01:38:33,344 --> 01:38:35,904
He has to get FDA approval for the sale of the products easy

2145
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:37,696
If he's engaging in this sort of

2146
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:43,328
In addition to FDA approval if Alex is selling a drug he's required to label his bottle

2147
01:38:43,584 --> 01:38:44,608
With known side effects

2148
01:38:44,864 --> 01:38:45,632
Contraindication

2149
01:38:45,888 --> 01:38:46,656
Thanks for the drug drug

2150
01:38:46,912 --> 01:38:47,680
Directions Etc

2151
01:38:48,448 --> 01:38:51,264
I went to the Infowars store and looked at Alex's labeling

2152
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:53,312
For his immune gargle they had Ella

2153
01:38:54,592 --> 01:38:55,104
And it doesn't

2154
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:56,128
Include any of those things

2155
01:38:56,640 --> 01:38:57,920
In fact it has a warning

2156
01:38:58,176 --> 01:39:00,736
The claims he makes have not been evaluated by the FDA

2157
01:39:01,248 --> 01:39:03,040
But you can't do this is a drug

2158
01:39:03,552 --> 01:39:04,064
It's weird

2159
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:06,880
Because if you look at the label for his super silver wound gel

2160
01:39:07,136 --> 01:39:09,696
There is a statement that it's been evaluated and is effective

2161
01:39:10,208 --> 01:39:10,976
Can staph infection

2162
01:39:11,232 --> 01:39:13,024
E-coli Bursa and a few other

2163
01:39:14,048 --> 01:39:18,400
Weird that he would label that one correctly as a drug and is nanosilver mouth gargle

2164
01:39:18,656 --> 01:39:20,448
As the standard supplement labeling

2165
01:39:21,728 --> 01:39:22,496
He's selling it as if it

2166
01:39:22,752 --> 01:39:23,264
The drug

2167
01:39:24,288 --> 01:39:27,616
Consider the fact that there are some dissenting voices

2168
01:39:27,872 --> 01:39:29,920
The matter of nanotechnology

2169
01:39:30,176 --> 01:39:30,944
Vegan supplements

2170
01:39:31,456 --> 01:39:32,480
Review from narcos

2171
01:39:33,248 --> 01:39:35,808
However nanotechnology carries risks

2172
01:39:36,064 --> 01:39:37,344
The primary one being long damn

2173
01:39:38,112 --> 01:39:39,136
Studies have shown that the

2174
01:39:39,392 --> 01:39:41,696
Most nanoparticles migrate to the lungs

2175
01:39:42,208 --> 01:39:44,000
Other organs are susceptible to damage as well

2176
01:39:44,512 --> 01:39:46,048
Scientist who found that sometimes

2177
01:39:46,304 --> 01:39:50,400
An activity of this destruction process leads to cell.

2178
01:39:51,168 --> 01:39:54,240
Metal silver made damaged mitochondria which leads to

2179
01:39:54,496 --> 01:39:55,008
The DNA bear

2180
01:39:56,032 --> 01:39:56,800
Until further Evidence

2181
01:39:57,312 --> 01:39:59,360
Concludes nanoparticles

2182
01:39:59,616 --> 01:40:02,688
To use what is true and tested for several decades

2183
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:04,992
And consider colloidal silver without

2184
01:40:05,248 --> 01:40:05,760
Nanoparticles

2185
01:40:06,784 --> 01:40:09,856
That was an article from Infowars

2186
01:40:11,392 --> 01:40:14,208
From December 23rd 2014

2187
01:40:15,232 --> 01:40:21,376
Silver

2188
01:40:21,632 --> 01:40:24,192
Fake medicine Community nanosilver was all the rage

2189
01:40:24,704 --> 01:40:28,032
Rema labor was selling it as an ebola cure and people were excited about the

2190
01:40:28,288 --> 01:40:28,800
His new breakthrough

2191
01:40:29,056 --> 01:40:32,128
But since Alex didn't have a stake in the market is messaging was that it

2192
01:40:32,384 --> 01:40:34,176
Was dangerous and you just use colloidal cell

2193
01:40:34,944 --> 01:40:36,480
We can go back to 2008

2194
01:40:36,736 --> 01:40:38,784
Find out the posting an article titled

2195
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:43,392
Scientists care does nanotechnology and nanoparticles become common in consumer

2196
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:47,488
In Articles all about Heather dangerous side effects to nanosilver

2197
01:40:47,744 --> 01:40:50,048
Like pollution The Kills aquatic ecosystem

2198
01:40:50,816 --> 01:40:52,096
The article says quote

2199
01:40:52,352 --> 01:40:53,376
Ionic silver is

2200
01:40:53,632 --> 01:40:54,656
Is

2201
01:40:54,912 --> 01:40:55,680
The humans at very high

2202
01:40:55,936 --> 01:40:56,448
High levels

2203
01:40:56,704 --> 01:41:00,032
The toxicity of nanoparticles silver said westerhoff

2204
01:41:00,288 --> 01:41:01,312
Has yet to be determined

2205
01:41:02,336 --> 01:41:05,152
At that point Alex was not selling nanosilver

2206
01:41:05,408 --> 01:41:06,432
That is the important

2207
01:41:07,968 --> 01:41:09,504
Stick with colloidal silver

2208
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:10,784
Because I'm not selling Thanos

2209
01:41:11,296 --> 01:41:13,600
Right now I'm telling nanosilver

2210
01:41:14,368 --> 01:41:15,392
It's actually a

2211
01:41:15,648 --> 01:41:19,232
Cure for a virus that literally we don't know a ton about

2212
01:41:19,488 --> 01:41:21,792
Skillsource

2213
01:41:22,048 --> 01:41:26,400
The important thing that we're going to get you a little bit later is

2214
01:41:26,912 --> 01:41:28,704
Medical Claims can be made about the

2215
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:30,240
Topical silver gel

2216
01:41:30,752 --> 01:41:31,776
Because that has been

2217
01:41:32,032 --> 01:41:36,640
Evaluated by the FDA and it can be sold as a drug and there are warnings on

2218
01:41:36,896 --> 01:41:38,176
That that

2219
01:41:39,456 --> 01:41:42,272
That is not true of his other nanosilver product

2220
01:41:42,784 --> 01:41:44,064
He's trying to play fast

2221
01:41:45,088 --> 01:41:46,880
With which product is which

2222
01:41:47,392 --> 01:41:48,160
You can make claims

2223
01:41:48,672 --> 01:41:49,440
About the gel

2224
01:41:49,696 --> 01:41:50,464
Show me a picture

2225
01:41:52,256 --> 01:41:54,304
About these other nanosilver products

2226
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:56,352
And you eat playing a little shell game

2227
01:41:56,608 --> 01:41:59,936
That's such that like the supplement industry is a

2228
01:42:00,192 --> 01:42:01,216
Billions Dollar in

2229
01:42:01,472 --> 01:42:04,032
Industry mainly because they can figure out a way to live in that

2230
01:42:04,288 --> 01:42:04,800
Agraria

2231
01:42:05,312 --> 01:42:11,456
That's the situation outside I don't know exactly at 1

2232
01:42:11,968 --> 01:42:15,296
The FDA would care or take action

2233
01:42:15,552 --> 01:42:16,064
Intel

2234
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:17,856
Seems like he's very close

2235
01:42:18,112 --> 01:42:19,648
I'm testing the waters as to what

2236
01:42:19,904 --> 01:42:20,672
You can get away with yeah

2237
01:42:20,928 --> 01:42:21,952
Which is really f*****

2238
01:42:22,976 --> 01:42:23,488
That's

2239
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:24,768
That's God

2240
01:42:25,024 --> 01:42:28,096
That should be I don't know how to police that but

2241
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:33,216
Supplement huckster like Alex should not also be able to have enough.

2242
01:42:33,472 --> 01:42:33,984
Approved drug

2243
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:37,312
Like it should be you're either an FDA-approved

2244
01:42:37,568 --> 01:42:38,336
Drug salesman

2245
01:42:38,848 --> 01:42:39,616
Or I I don't know

2246
01:42:40,128 --> 01:42:43,712
You can't that's so f***** up that you have similarly-named products

2247
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:48,320
Explicitly for topical use

2248
01:42:48,576 --> 01:42:52,416
To be ingested who be very difficult for anyone who did any kind of

2249
01:42:53,696 --> 01:42:54,976
Looking into it to get them

2250
01:42:55,232 --> 01:42:58,048
I'm confused

2251
01:42:58,304 --> 01:42:59,584
Okay well

2252
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:02,144
Give some indication that the audience

2253
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:03,936
Don't eat the bun shop

2254
01:43:04,192 --> 01:43:06,240
Because LA's is opening

2255
01:43:06,496 --> 01:43:08,032
A statement on every show.

2256
01:43:10,336 --> 01:43:12,384
Some sort of letter here

2257
01:43:15,712 --> 01:43:16,992
Not he's not reading

2258
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:18,528
Really like

2259
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:20,576
Important

2260
01:43:21,088 --> 01:43:22,624
I don't know what's going on here but

2261
01:43:23,136 --> 01:43:24,416
This is what he's using

2262
01:43:24,928 --> 01:43:26,208
Sort of imply

2263
01:43:26,464 --> 01:43:28,256
That his products are useful again

2264
01:43:28,512 --> 01:43:29,024
That's the Coronavirus

2265
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:35,424
Army Headquarters United States Special Operations Command

2266
01:43:35,936 --> 01:43:37,216
Tampa Point Boulevard

2267
01:43:38,752 --> 01:43:40,032
And receive on Edinburg

2268
01:43:40,288 --> 01:43:42,080
Attraction

2269
01:43:42,592 --> 01:43:45,664
They go on to say that with antibiotic-resistant smaller Iced Out

2270
01:43:46,176 --> 01:43:49,248
We have found that this particular type of nanosilver

2271
01:43:50,528 --> 01:43:52,064
Effective against each other

2272
01:43:53,344 --> 01:43:54,624
Then it goes on here

2273
01:43:56,416 --> 01:43:57,952
The Texas A&M system

2274
01:43:58,208 --> 01:43:59,232
Health Science Center

2275
01:44:04,608 --> 01:44:05,120
Because

2276
01:44:06,912 --> 01:44:08,960
Stuff out for a lot of reasons

2277
01:44:10,752 --> 01:44:12,544
Says Dear secretary Ridge

2278
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:15,104
And I go on to see the office of Homeland Security

2279
01:44:15,360 --> 01:44:17,152
John B Connelly building

2280
01:44:19,456 --> 01:44:22,272
Vacuum dining for an old secret project for the government

2281
01:44:26,368 --> 01:44:28,160
In our trials secret trials

2282
01:44:28,928 --> 01:44:29,952
Secret

2283
01:44:30,976 --> 01:44:32,768
American biotech labs

2284
01:44:33,280 --> 01:44:34,048
Was very upset

2285
01:44:36,608 --> 01:44:40,192
This report is that the Coronavirus

2286
01:44:40,448 --> 01:44:41,472
Without the data

2287
01:44:41,984 --> 01:44:43,008
Our product to kill

2288
01:44:44,032 --> 01:44:46,336
Security

2289
01:44:46,592 --> 01:44:47,360
The secretary.

2290
01:44:47,872 --> 01:44:48,384
Carrollton

2291
01:44:49,152 --> 01:44:51,712
Internal Air Force brilliant man came up with the model

2292
01:44:51,968 --> 01:44:53,504
Hospital system of autism

2293
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:56,320
Don't receive a copy of it because our testimony

2294
01:44:56,832 --> 01:44:57,856
Before Congress

2295
01:44:59,392 --> 01:45:01,440
And it was included in the addendum

2296
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:08,608
Richard heaven.

2297
01:45:11,424 --> 01:45:13,216
None of this matters in terms of what Alex

2298
01:45:13,472 --> 01:45:13,984
Does doing

2299
01:45:14,240 --> 01:45:16,288
If the testing really is there that's cool

2300
01:45:16,544 --> 01:45:18,592
I've no idea what he's talking about because it's

2301
01:45:18,848 --> 01:45:19,616
Apparently secrets

2302
01:45:19,872 --> 01:45:21,920
Secret testing

2303
01:45:22,176 --> 01:45:24,992
You can find a medical journals that indicate there's some promise for Nano cell

2304
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:27,808
Alex Fields emboldened by these secret study

2305
01:45:28,064 --> 01:45:29,344
Clearly hasn't read

2306
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:34,464
Honestly I'd be surprised if even read that letter prior to getting on are based on the way he's jumping around

2307
01:45:34,976 --> 01:45:37,280
Whatever is highlighted

2308
01:45:37,536 --> 01:45:43,168
Because he feels emboldened he's drifting super close to selling this silver is a cure for the Coronavirus

2309
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:45,472
And if he's doing that he's entered akam

2310
01:45:45,728 --> 01:45:46,752
Completely different game

2311
01:45:47,008 --> 01:45:48,032
And he's at the great risk

2312
01:45:48,288 --> 01:45:49,312
The FDA getting involved

2313
01:45:49,568 --> 01:45:50,336
At which point

2314
01:45:50,592 --> 01:45:52,384
I mean that's the last

2315
01:45:52,640 --> 01:45:53,408
Thing that he wants yeah

2316
01:45:53,664 --> 01:45:54,944
I really don't

2317
01:45:55,200 --> 01:45:56,224
I think you want can't handle another

2318
01:45:56,736 --> 01:45:57,504
Now

2319
01:45:57,760 --> 01:46:01,600
The Heathman can't handle the fronts that he's on right now let alone adding BF

2320
01:46:01,856 --> 01:46:02,368
VA into

2321
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:06,464
He's been teasing that he's going to you know reveal the name

2322
01:46:06,720 --> 01:46:07,488
Silver

2323
01:46:07,744 --> 01:46:08,256
Supplier

2324
01:46:08,768 --> 01:46:09,792
He doesn't this

2325
01:46:10,048 --> 01:46:12,864
Next B2 he also revealed that is a dad

2326
01:46:13,376 --> 01:46:15,424
His dad is behind all the supplement

2327
01:46:17,216 --> 01:46:19,520
Which I wasn't clear on but I also don't care

2328
01:46:20,288 --> 01:46:24,128
What's the Lakers are going to say that I need you to come in and manage Shuffle much we need to put on the wrong side of the bed

2329
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:27,712
You've brought the fee doesn't reach her sinuses well this thing

2330
01:46:30,784 --> 01:46:31,808
Get it

2331
01:46:32,832 --> 01:46:35,392
He brought us the folks that are the Super Silver

2332
01:46:38,976 --> 01:46:39,744
Which is the top company

2333
01:46:40,768 --> 01:46:42,304
I know just who we are

2334
01:46:43,584 --> 01:46:46,912
American biotech Labs LLC that's the big one

2335
01:46:47,168 --> 01:46:48,704
The only ones that have approved

2336
01:46:51,264 --> 01:46:52,032
The counter

2337
01:47:02,784 --> 01:47:07,392
American biotech Labs is a legitimate company they focus on large part of their business

2338
01:47:07,648 --> 01:47:08,416
This is medical application

2339
01:47:08,672 --> 01:47:09,184
Silver

2340
01:47:09,696 --> 01:47:11,744
They have an FDA approval for the wound dressing

2341
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:12,768
But

2342
01:47:13,024 --> 01:47:14,560
Use of nanosilver is top

2343
01:47:15,072 --> 01:47:15,584
And it's not

2344
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:19,168
Same nanosilver that isn't Alex's products that are taken internally

2345
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:20,960
He cannot take the approach

2346
01:47:21,216 --> 01:47:23,776
5908 disapproval is here for the gel

2347
01:47:24,032 --> 01:47:27,360
And then just apply to other products because they're both silver made by the same company

2348
01:47:27,872 --> 01:47:28,640
That is not cool

2349
01:47:29,152 --> 01:47:29,664
You cannot do that

2350
01:47:30,176 --> 01:47:33,760
Also interesting Lee American biotech Labs uses silver salt

2351
01:47:35,296 --> 01:47:36,576
Nano silver

2352
01:47:37,856 --> 01:47:44,000
Guess what that is exactly the same nanosilver that was used in Reema lebos products which earned her a warning from the FDA and

2353
01:47:44,256 --> 01:47:48,096
2014 gray forgetting too far down the road Alex is starting to go down

2354
01:47:48,608 --> 01:47:52,192
The more details Alex gives out the more it looks like he's heading that same direction

2355
01:47:52,448 --> 01:47:53,472
Which would be great for

2356
01:47:53,728 --> 01:47:59,104
Cuz I need to pretend that he doesn't understand rules and play the victim of government oppression tried to wipe out my supplement business

2357
01:47:59,872 --> 01:48:00,384
Also

2358
01:48:00,896 --> 01:48:04,224
Now that I know where Alex is getting his silver wound gel from I can compare price

2359
01:48:05,248 --> 01:48:06,528
If you buy it from Alex

2360
01:48:06,784 --> 01:48:08,576
You're going to pay 50% off 10

2361
01:48:09,344 --> 01:48:12,160
Your P30 995 for a 4oz

2362
01:48:12,416 --> 01:48:12,928
What's bottle

2363
01:48:13,184 --> 01:48:15,488
Currently mark down to 2397

2364
01:48:16,256 --> 01:48:17,536
If you buy it from a website like

2365
01:48:17,792 --> 01:48:18,560
Vitacost

2366
01:48:18,816 --> 01:48:20,352
Without the Infowars labeling

2367
01:48:20,608 --> 01:48:22,912
Just the American biotech labs

2368
01:48:23,168 --> 01:48:23,936
Product

2369
01:48:24,448 --> 01:48:28,288
It cost 2799 for a 4oz bottle currently markdown

2370
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:29,312
1690

2371
01:48:30,336 --> 01:48:31,616
Rye Rye

2372
01:48:32,128 --> 01:48:35,456
You can get everything that he sells cheaper without the Infowars labeling

2373
01:48:35,968 --> 01:48:36,480
If you just go to

2374
01:48:36,736 --> 01:48:38,016
This is a really dumb idea

2375
01:48:38,272 --> 01:48:41,344
Take all the products from there

2376
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:42,368
Put on new labels

2377
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:43,904
Anybody was in his audience

2378
01:48:44,416 --> 01:48:48,000
I guess it still is just for funding the Infowars

2379
01:48:48,256 --> 01:48:49,536
But you're paying way more

2380
01:48:49,792 --> 01:48:51,584
I guess that's

2381
01:48:53,376 --> 01:48:53,888
I got nothing

2382
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:56,448
That's a mean that's standard like

2383
01:48:56,704 --> 01:48:58,240
Say the MSRP is this

2384
01:48:58,496 --> 01:49:01,056
Deflated and you still have your profit by

2385
01:49:02,336 --> 01:49:04,384
But I'm not at all

2386
01:49:04,640 --> 01:49:08,224
Angry about people who do markups in order to allow their business

2387
01:49:09,504 --> 01:49:10,272
I am again

2388
01:49:10,784 --> 01:49:12,832
People who make their entire presentation

2389
01:49:13,088 --> 01:49:17,184
Hey we don't bark anything up we're not playing a game here and then all the prices are higher

2390
01:49:17,440 --> 01:49:21,536
Then other places you can find the exact same product with a different label

2391
01:49:23,072 --> 01:49:24,096
If he starts a

2392
01:49:24,352 --> 01:49:25,376
With a clause

2393
01:49:25,888 --> 01:49:29,216
Then the following Clause will prove that he was lying about the

2394
01:49:29,984 --> 01:49:30,496
Sure

2395
01:49:30,752 --> 01:49:33,056
I just take issue with that

2396
01:49:34,336 --> 01:49:35,616
I think that I would

2397
01:49:35,872 --> 01:49:36,384
Close

2398
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:37,152
2

2399
01:49:37,664 --> 01:49:38,176
Like

2400
01:49:38,432 --> 01:49:39,200
Badwater

2401
01:49:39,456 --> 01:49:41,504
I am not positive that he's

2402
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:43,040
Fully in violation

2403
01:49:43,296 --> 01:49:44,064
NFPA guideline

2404
01:49:44,832 --> 01:49:45,600
But I think he's

2405
01:49:45,856 --> 01:49:46,880
Really f****** clothes

2406
01:49:47,136 --> 01:49:52,256
And the way he's trying to sort of Muddy the water with the the gel and the gargle

2407
01:49:52,512 --> 01:49:53,792
Is just like

2408
01:49:55,072 --> 01:49:59,936
It's it's a bit of a cup game cuz the implication and the message of the audience is supposed to get

2409
01:50:00,448 --> 01:50:01,984
Is that the gargle

2410
01:50:02,240 --> 01:50:03,264
Will have the same effect

2411
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:04,544
Kill the Coronavirus

2412
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:06,848
Where is that is not an FDA approved

2413
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:09,152
Because he's not

2414
01:50:09,408 --> 01:50:12,480
Illicitly saying that just dancing around it I don't know if it's at

2415
01:50:14,016 --> 01:50:15,296
The intention is there and it's bad

2416
01:50:15,552 --> 01:50:17,088
He does sound resentful toward his dad

2417
01:50:17,600 --> 01:50:18,112
The immune Target

2418
01:50:19,648 --> 01:50:21,696
Terrible name the technical name you can drink

2419
01:50:21,952 --> 01:50:22,464
Note 10

2420
01:50:22,976 --> 01:50:24,000
Show biz

2421
01:50:24,512 --> 01:50:25,280
Clip is a little long

2422
01:50:26,048 --> 01:50:27,840
But I think it's one of these things

2423
01:50:28,864 --> 01:50:29,376
It's

2424
01:50:29,632 --> 01:50:30,400
Kind of against

2425
01:50:31,680 --> 01:50:32,192
Throughout this

2426
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:33,728
You will hear

2427
01:50:33,984 --> 01:50:35,776
At least four instances where you're like

2428
01:50:36,032 --> 01:50:36,800
He's about to do an ad page

2429
01:50:37,056 --> 01:50:38,592
Okay about to do an ad pivot

2430
01:50:39,104 --> 01:50:43,712
And it never come now that's f***** up if you can't do that to me now it's important

2431
01:50:44,480 --> 01:50:47,808
I've ruined it but it's important to show every now and again

2432
01:50:48,832 --> 01:50:52,160
Exact same behavior and then just never hits the dismount

2433
01:50:52,672 --> 01:50:53,184
It's rare

2434
01:50:53,440 --> 01:50:55,488
It doesn't happen very often but I think this is an

2435
01:50:55,744 --> 01:50:56,256
Intense

2436
01:50:56,512 --> 01:50:57,792
Example of it

2437
01:50:58,304 --> 01:51:01,888
The reason the president have more support as they threatened everyone around him

2438
01:51:03,168 --> 01:51:06,752
We're talkin sex operatives infiltration grab their bank accounts

2439
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:12,896
The kids I mean it's it's it's it's beyond any movie you ever see again

2440
01:51:13,664 --> 01:51:16,992
We just saw Canadian Royal Mounted Police saying we're going to put you in prison

2441
01:51:18,016 --> 01:51:20,320
Wilke Road against Trudeau I mean

2442
01:51:21,088 --> 01:51:22,880
These people are Unchained

2443
01:51:23,136 --> 01:51:24,672
I have no chivalrous

2444
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:27,744
Chivalry

2445
01:51:28,256 --> 01:51:29,024
Is what

2446
01:51:30,048 --> 01:51:31,072
Powerful people do because

2447
01:51:31,584 --> 01:51:33,376
They want some rules on themselves

2448
01:51:34,656 --> 01:51:35,936
Want to get registered at 1

2449
01:51:36,192 --> 01:51:39,264
Start going down that line they're going to reap the Whirlwind

2450
01:51:40,288 --> 01:51:42,080
I got to tell you something from bottom of my heart

2451
01:51:44,128 --> 01:51:46,688
Obviously

2452
01:51:48,224 --> 01:51:50,528
Incredible historic hives and I just

2453
01:51:52,576 --> 01:51:53,344
Wedgewood golf

2454
01:51:54,368 --> 01:51:56,672
Thank you so much what you're doing

2455
01:51:58,720 --> 01:52:03,328
They can put a gun to my head I would stop doing this she understand that because this is like getting oxygen

2456
01:52:04,864 --> 01:52:05,888
Huge Skin Diver butt

2457
01:52:06,912 --> 01:52:09,728
About 80 feet.

2458
01:52:10,752 --> 01:52:13,312
Compressor your blood sodium or oxygenation but

2459
01:52:13,824 --> 01:52:16,640
It go back up you got to watch out for

2460
01:52:17,152 --> 01:52:20,992
So here here is where I thought I just meant to get to plug and he got

2461
01:52:21,248 --> 01:52:23,296
Just distracted by talking about skin diving

2462
01:52:23,552 --> 01:52:26,368
The plug is going to come after the skin.

2463
01:52:29,184 --> 01:52:34,816
Everything's so bright

2464
01:52:37,632 --> 01:52:38,656
I start using tolls

2465
01:52:38,912 --> 01:52:39,936
Analogy

2466
01:52:40,192 --> 01:52:40,704
But

2467
01:52:43,776 --> 01:52:44,288
Products

2468
01:52:46,336 --> 01:52:46,848
Services

2469
01:52:47,616 --> 01:52:49,152
I know I was using an allergy

2470
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:51,968
Good McDonald talking points here but the.

2471
01:52:52,224 --> 01:52:52,736
This is like

2472
01:52:53,504 --> 01:52:55,296
Stop in there

2473
01:53:00,672 --> 01:53:01,440
Slippers

2474
01:53:01,696 --> 01:53:02,720
I just want to get that are

2475
01:53:04,256 --> 01:53:07,840
So here I'm thinking like okay he's found it he's now going to use like

2476
01:53:08,096 --> 01:53:14,240
You giving me money exactly that I need to continue to fight for the only reason

2477
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:19,360
Blood pressure

2478
01:53:22,944 --> 01:53:25,504
Well you don't have Aaron did

2479
01:53:26,016 --> 01:53:32,160
Show me fighting tyranny is knots on the road ever

2480
01:53:36,768 --> 01:53:38,048
And the air in our lungs

2481
01:53:38,304 --> 01:53:39,072
Is

2482
01:53:41,376 --> 01:53:41,888
Money

2483
01:53:43,168 --> 01:53:45,728
It's not like something really thing to

2484
01:53:45,984 --> 01:53:51,360
Love your children or somebody walks up punches you in the face and kick their ass that's not it rolling

2485
01:53:53,152 --> 01:53:54,432
Giving us money as hero

2486
01:53:55,456 --> 01:53:56,224
Thing about fighting

2487
01:53:57,248 --> 01:53:59,296
You don't want to get if I was something I certify with you

2488
01:53:59,808 --> 01:54:02,112
But you know soon as they take a swing or soon as I can

2489
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:04,928
You know what I'm going to beat your ass

2490
01:54:05,696 --> 01:54:08,512
Satisfying

2491
01:54:09,792 --> 01:54:14,400
Really hard and then rallies again knocking down again of that all the sudden

2492
01:54:16,448 --> 01:54:17,216
White Sternos

2493
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:21,312
I'm telling you

2494
01:54:21,824 --> 01:54:23,616
Thank me for this b**** is

2495
01:54:24,896 --> 01:54:26,688
Pigeon the animated contest of Liberty

2496
01:54:27,200 --> 01:54:28,480
This is what it's all about

2497
01:54:28,992 --> 01:54:32,320
And here's where you think he's going to jump it right there if

2498
01:54:32,576 --> 01:54:36,160
Are you support me I can continue the acklay absolutely

2499
01:54:36,416 --> 01:54:36,928
Absolutely

2500
01:54:37,696 --> 01:54:41,024
Anywhere else if it weren't for you

2501
01:54:44,608 --> 01:54:45,888
I'm not going to put on some fake

2502
01:54:47,168 --> 01:54:48,960
Bible thumper BS up here

2503
01:54:49,472 --> 01:54:50,240
Jesus

2504
01:54:51,008 --> 01:54:51,776
You just made me

2505
01:54:53,056 --> 01:54:56,128
I love God and whatever God does through me it happens

2506
01:54:56,640 --> 01:54:58,688
Now here's where I thought he was going to get sacrilegious

2507
01:55:02,272 --> 01:55:02,784
It's been minute

2508
01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:06,624
The clock to get to the commercials

2509
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:10,208
Absolutely I have no idea what

2510
01:55:10,464 --> 01:55:13,536
Trying to say skin diving

2511
01:55:13,792 --> 01:55:16,352
Kick somebody's teeth out I don't want to be like that

2512
01:55:16,864 --> 01:55:18,144
Jesus loves me I guess

2513
01:55:18,400 --> 01:55:21,472
So I thought like okay he's accidentally started talkin about Jesus

2514
01:55:21,728 --> 01:55:27,872
He's going to have to use that somehow to launch into his ass and I think honestly maybe because he started talking so much

2515
01:55:28,128 --> 01:55:29,152
Jesus here at the end

2516
01:55:29,408 --> 01:55:30,432
Maybe that precluded

2517
01:55:30,688 --> 01:55:31,456
I'm probably realize like

2518
01:55:31,712 --> 01:55:32,736
There's not a really good

2519
01:55:33,248 --> 01:55:34,272
Swingpoynt nothing

2520
01:55:34,528 --> 01:55:40,160
Jesus loves more than naked capitalism used and it exploded as manager

2521
01:55:41,952 --> 01:55:45,536
God didn't want me to stand up there and tell me what app is I am all day

2522
01:55:45,792 --> 01:55:49,632
I read the Bible And I memorized this and I'm

2523
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:51,680
God wants me to get up

2524
01:55:52,192 --> 01:55:56,288
Take on the New World Order

2525
01:55:57,568 --> 01:55:58,080
God

2526
01:55:58,336 --> 01:55:59,616
8 Scouts

2527
01:56:01,664 --> 01:56:02,176
That's not true

2528
01:56:02,432 --> 01:56:03,968
No one knows who originally said that was true

2529
01:56:04,224 --> 01:56:05,504
God

2530
01:56:06,272 --> 01:56:09,344
Literally the meek shall inherit the earth you dumbass

2531
01:56:09,856 --> 01:56:12,416
You are default position to not have fear

2532
01:56:14,464 --> 01:56:14,976
Is it God's will

2533
01:56:17,280 --> 01:56:21,376
Flashes in perfect the process

2534
01:56:21,632 --> 01:56:22,400
A plane

2535
01:56:22,656 --> 01:56:24,960
Have you got to be put through the fire

2536
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:30,848
Play the Metal it's all about

2537
01:56:31,104 --> 01:56:32,640
Are you guys out to commercial agent

2538
01:56:32,896 --> 01:56:33,920
That's the weirdest thing

2539
01:56:34,432 --> 01:56:37,248
It's so weird I do so many points that are like

2540
01:56:37,504 --> 01:56:38,528
This is a classic

2541
01:56:39,040 --> 01:56:44,160
I'm mad because I was trying to sell his product

2542
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:48,512
Here we go

2543
01:56:48,768 --> 01:56:50,304
Call Mansell machete

2544
01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:52,864
We have proven that Alex Jones

2545
01:56:53,120 --> 01:56:54,912
I've never read the Bible or has

2546
01:56:55,168 --> 01:56:56,192
Has no idea what the con

2547
01:56:56,704 --> 01:56:57,984
No Genesis 1:1

2548
01:56:58,496 --> 01:57:00,288
The beginning God hates

2549
01:57:00,544 --> 01:57:06,688
Gacha my bad I don't know who said that wasn't God admittedly or in the Bible

2550
01:57:06,944 --> 01:57:08,736
God really likes people

2551
01:57:08,992 --> 01:57:10,016
Default position of no fear

2552
01:57:10,272 --> 01:57:14,368
Loves it loves that no fear clothing line

2553
01:57:14,624 --> 01:57:15,904
God wears nothing but

2554
01:57:16,160 --> 01:57:21,792
Three wolf Moon tee shot is basically a dog with a t-shirt

2555
01:57:22,304 --> 01:57:23,072
Anyway

2556
01:57:23,584 --> 01:57:25,376
I think one of the reasons that Alex could have

2557
01:57:25,632 --> 01:57:26,656
Afford to not

2558
01:57:26,912 --> 01:57:27,424
Duo

2559
01:57:27,680 --> 01:57:28,192
Pivot there

2560
01:57:28,448 --> 01:57:29,216
4ad

2561
01:57:29,984 --> 01:57:33,312
Is that he's hosting the fourth h o u show

2562
01:57:33,824 --> 01:57:35,872
And it's entirely

2563
01:57:36,128 --> 01:57:40,480
About survival food

2564
01:57:40,736 --> 01:57:41,248
Alex

2565
01:57:42,016 --> 01:57:42,784
Super defensive

2566
01:57:43,296 --> 01:57:44,576
About selling the survival

2567
01:57:45,600 --> 01:57:47,904
Before this next guest joins

2568
01:57:48,416 --> 01:57:50,208
I'm just going to talk about this right now

2569
01:57:56,864 --> 01:57:57,376
Start selling

2570
01:57:57,632 --> 01:57:59,168
Storable food to the audience

2571
01:57:59,680 --> 01:58:01,472
Monster 6 months ago or a year ago

2572
01:58:03,008 --> 01:58:04,032
Horrible food

2573
01:58:07,872 --> 01:58:08,384
I've been doing that

2574
01:58:08,896 --> 01:58:09,920
For 20-plus years

2575
01:58:11,200 --> 01:58:16,832
Cuz it makes sense to me that insurance you can eat during any crisis and we hope Trump and America wins we hope

2576
01:58:17,344 --> 01:58:18,624
Globalist get defeated

2577
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:21,952
But in a war like this there isn't any arming

2578
01:58:22,976 --> 01:58:24,000
The Winds of War

2579
01:58:24,256 --> 01:58:25,792
Politically or militarily

2580
01:58:26,048 --> 01:58:27,328
It doesn't have food

2581
01:58:29,120 --> 01:58:29,632
True

2582
01:58:30,656 --> 01:58:32,192
We're talkin about here to polian

2583
01:58:32,960 --> 01:58:35,008
When in the Russia Iran a fool you fell

2584
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:37,568
T-Fal

2585
01:58:37,824 --> 01:58:41,152
Are these examples of people you wish had more food

2586
01:58:41,664 --> 01:58:42,944
Absolute

2587
01:58:43,456 --> 01:58:45,760
This is a big problem with Hitler was he

2588
01:58:46,016 --> 01:58:50,368
By my phone this is bad Freeman

2589
01:58:50,624 --> 01:58:52,928
Yo what Hitler but he didn't have no food

2590
01:58:53,184 --> 01:58:54,976
Real tragedy

2591
01:58:55,232 --> 01:58:56,512
Just didn't have enough food

2592
01:58:58,560 --> 01:59:00,352
Already off to a weird start

2593
01:59:00,864 --> 01:59:04,192
If pulpot had enough food man he would have been able to kill way more p

2594
01:59:04,704 --> 01:59:05,728
So Alex

2595
01:59:05,984 --> 01:59:06,752
Is like

2596
01:59:08,288 --> 01:59:09,568
Before we get to this next gas

2597
01:59:09,824 --> 01:59:10,848
In the next gas station

2598
01:59:11,104 --> 01:59:12,384
The guy who runs my Patriots

2599
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:15,968
Survival

2600
01:59:16,224 --> 01:59:18,016
This is a big old info

2601
01:59:18,272 --> 01:59:19,296
Marshall

2602
01:59:19,552 --> 01:59:20,576
Loyal

2603
01:59:21,088 --> 01:59:21,600
You love's

2604
01:59:21,856 --> 01:59:22,368
My Patriot

2605
01:59:22,624 --> 01:59:23,136
Supply

2606
01:59:23,392 --> 01:59:24,672
But the thing is the reason

2607
01:59:24,928 --> 01:59:26,464
He's been being reached out to

2608
01:59:26,720 --> 01:59:28,512
Dubai other survival food company

2609
01:59:29,280 --> 01:59:35,168
And the way you trying to get more money out of this. I don't think it's a shake that

2610
01:59:35,424 --> 01:59:36,448
What it is

2611
01:59:36,704 --> 01:59:38,752
Convoluted as hell the way you presenting this

2612
01:59:39,264 --> 01:59:45,408
Obviously I just straight shoot blisters it's all I can do it's my superpower is that I just

2613
01:59:45,664 --> 01:59:48,480
Tell the truth what's going on

2614
01:59:55,392 --> 01:59:58,464
Coronavirus is obviously out of control and I said

2615
01:59:59,232 --> 01:59:59,744
Promoting

2616
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:01,792
Water filtration is horrible Foods

2617
02:00:02,048 --> 02:00:04,608
And the best oral surgeon the best water filtration

2618
02:00:05,376 --> 02:00:06,144
Not going to sit here like

2619
02:00:06,400 --> 02:00:07,168
Freak out this point

2620
02:00:08,448 --> 02:00:10,496
But then we saw the sales

2621
02:00:12,032 --> 02:00:13,568
This weekend just Skyrocket

2622
02:00:13,824 --> 02:00:16,384
And then I got some calls not just

2623
02:00:16,896 --> 02:00:17,408
From

2624
02:00:18,432 --> 02:00:19,968
Water my Patriot Supply

2625
02:00:20,480 --> 02:00:21,504
But I got called

2626
02:00:22,272 --> 02:00:23,808
From all over the country

2627
02:00:25,088 --> 02:00:25,600
Different

2628
02:00:25,856 --> 02:00:26,624
Companies

2629
02:00:26,880 --> 02:00:28,416
Trying to get me

2630
02:00:29,952 --> 02:00:31,744
Product becomes sponsor suddenly

2631
02:00:32,512 --> 02:00:33,792
Right and here's why

2632
02:00:34,304 --> 02:00:35,584
You're good at that

2633
02:00:35,840 --> 02:00:40,192
You are good at scaring people are dedicated audience

2634
02:00:40,448 --> 02:00:41,728
Are moving products

2635
02:00:41,984 --> 02:00:43,008
Because you create

2636
02:00:43,264 --> 02:00:45,312
Pandemonium fears and like

2637
02:00:46,080 --> 02:00:47,360
Relate everything

2638
02:00:47,616 --> 02:00:49,152
Every kind of

2639
02:00:49,408 --> 02:00:51,968
Fear or anxiety people can have

2640
02:00:52,224 --> 02:00:52,992
You take

2641
02:00:53,504 --> 02:00:54,272
Amplify

2642
02:00:54,528 --> 02:00:55,296
And direct them

2643
02:00:55,552 --> 02:00:56,064
2

2644
02:00:56,320 --> 02:00:56,832
Whatever

2645
02:00:57,088 --> 02:00:58,368
Product you want to buy

2646
02:00:58,624 --> 02:01:01,696
If I were running a survival food company and I was a little bit should be

2647
02:01:01,952 --> 02:01:04,000
You better believe I'd be calling an absolute

2648
02:01:04,256 --> 02:01:10,144
Play hit your wagon to that bucket sales are skyrocketing

2649
02:01:10,400 --> 02:01:16,544
Because

2650
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:20,896
We are skyrocketing have people like Mike f****** Adam saying things like this

2651
02:01:21,408 --> 02:01:22,432
It's over for Humanity

2652
02:01:22,688 --> 02:01:24,480
Only be lone survivors

2653
02:01:24,736 --> 02:01:26,784
I'm never going to stop playing.

2654
02:01:34,208 --> 02:01:36,256
Ebola cure

2655
02:01:37,024 --> 02:01:37,536
Anyway

2656
02:01:37,792 --> 02:01:40,864
Like we have that kind of rhetoric being pushed

2657
02:01:41,120 --> 02:01:42,656
On the show you have at least

2658
02:01:42,912 --> 02:01:44,704
A certain amount of people who believe

2659
02:01:44,960 --> 02:01:47,264
Entrust Alex it's going to drive sale

2660
02:01:47,520 --> 02:01:50,080
Sales have been way off these other people want to get in

2661
02:01:50,336 --> 02:01:52,640
The game 2

2662
02:01:52,896 --> 02:01:53,408
Makes total sense

2663
02:01:54,176 --> 02:01:56,992
It's not just such that that like

2664
02:01:57,248 --> 02:01:59,040
This is the psychopathy of capital

2665
02:01:59,808 --> 02:02:01,856
Entirely like these guys are like

2666
02:02:03,648 --> 02:02:04,928
I'm definitely going to hit

2667
02:02:05,184 --> 02:02:09,024
My wagon to this f****** lying huckster salesman

2668
02:02:09,536 --> 02:02:11,840
Because I'm going to get a few more food buckets out

2669
02:02:12,096 --> 02:02:13,120
For the next couple of months

2670
02:02:13,376 --> 02:02:15,936
I think there's a I think there's a way the business

2671
02:02:16,192 --> 02:02:17,472
Mrs. can do these

2672
02:02:18,496 --> 02:02:21,312
Existing these faces ethically not with Alex

2673
02:02:21,568 --> 02:02:22,080
No

2674
02:02:22,336 --> 02:02:22,848
Certainly not

2675
02:02:25,152 --> 02:02:27,456
I have some thoughts on it there will come a little bit later

2676
02:02:27,712 --> 02:02:28,224
About like

2677
02:02:28,480 --> 02:02:30,528
I don't there's nothing intrinsically wrong

2678
02:02:30,784 --> 02:02:33,856
About selling survival food

2679
02:02:34,112 --> 02:02:36,416
You do it so I would be I would be

2680
02:02:36,672 --> 02:02:37,952
Prone to say like

2681
02:02:38,208 --> 02:02:38,720
Yes

2682
02:02:39,232 --> 02:02:39,744
The

2683
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:41,536
The pursuit of profit

2684
02:02:42,048 --> 02:02:43,840
Does tend to make people

2685
02:02:44,096 --> 02:02:45,376
The Haven weighs like

2686
02:02:45,888 --> 02:02:47,424
Getting Alex to sell yours

2687
02:02:47,680 --> 02:02:48,448
If it works

2688
02:02:48,704 --> 02:02:49,472
Dusseldorf

2689
02:02:49,984 --> 02:02:50,496
And that's bad

2690
02:02:51,008 --> 02:02:51,520
That is bad

2691
02:02:51,776 --> 02:02:53,312
Do agree with you that

2692
02:02:53,568 --> 02:02:54,080
Thank you

2693
02:02:55,616 --> 02:02:56,128
So

2694
02:02:56,640 --> 02:02:57,408
Alex's

2695
02:02:59,200 --> 02:03:00,224
It's really strange

2696
02:03:00,480 --> 02:03:02,528
Because he's clearly feeling an infomercial

2697
02:03:02,784 --> 02:03:04,832
He has the guy from my Patriot Supply on

2698
02:03:05,344 --> 02:03:06,880
But he doesn't really want to it

2699
02:03:07,136 --> 02:03:10,464
Middleton infomercial absolutely trying to live in this world

2700
02:03:10,720 --> 02:03:11,232
Clean space

2701
02:03:11,744 --> 02:03:12,768
It just ends up not

2702
02:03:13,024 --> 02:03:13,536
Stop making sense

2703
02:03:14,048 --> 02:03:15,072
I am saying

2704
02:03:18,912 --> 02:03:19,424
So it is

2705
02:03:19,680 --> 02:03:20,192
The equation

2706
02:03:20,704 --> 02:03:21,472
Appreciate you

2707
02:03:21,728 --> 02:03:23,264
Yes I'm patching you food right now

2708
02:03:24,288 --> 02:03:25,056
He just said you weren't

2709
02:03:28,128 --> 02:03:28,640
The fact that

2710
02:03:30,688 --> 02:03:32,224
12 years they began

2711
02:03:32,736 --> 02:03:34,784
The philosophy of high-quality food

2712
02:03:35,552 --> 02:03:36,576
Low prices

2713
02:03:37,600 --> 02:03:39,136
Reason I got a Moniz

2714
02:03:39,648 --> 02:03:40,160
Why

2715
02:03:41,184 --> 02:03:43,488
From other food supplier saying we've sold out

2716
02:03:43,744 --> 02:03:45,280
Big institutional buyers

2717
02:03:46,048 --> 02:03:47,072
Call up

2718
02:03:47,584 --> 02:03:51,168
Believe your letter to try to buy our product I sold you have it on hand well

2719
02:03:51,680 --> 02:03:52,960
Not sure how fast it will get there

2720
02:03:53,216 --> 02:03:59,360
These other food companies that are calling him and trying to get him to sell their food

2721
02:03:59,872 --> 02:04:04,992
What is going on I'm not a look at this isn't the pitch but I'm going to try and picture food yeah

2722
02:04:05,248 --> 02:04:08,320
I'm saying I'm not pitching but I am going to 8 might as well

2723
02:04:08,576 --> 02:04:10,112
What is this I don't know

2724
02:04:10,368 --> 02:04:10,880
Pizza Hut

2725
02:04:11,136 --> 02:04:13,952
Bananas this is double speed I don't believe

2726
02:04:14,464 --> 02:04:18,048
Any of what he has a course not

2727
02:04:18,304 --> 02:04:18,816
What what

2728
02:04:19,328 --> 02:04:25,472
Stupid Survival company would be like okay we're going to call Alex now and we'll have food for them in 2 months

2729
02:04:25,728 --> 02:04:27,776
When this entire thing has blown up

2730
02:04:28,544 --> 02:04:29,568
No food

2731
02:04:29,824 --> 02:04:32,128
But we need more customer to go

2732
02:04:32,384 --> 02:04:33,664
Salesforce get on it

2733
02:04:33,920 --> 02:04:34,688
Call Alex

2734
02:04:34,944 --> 02:04:35,712
F****** Joan

2735
02:04:39,552 --> 02:04:42,624
Alex's is trying to like maintain that illusion

2736
02:04:43,136 --> 02:04:44,672
My Patriot Supply is on

2737
02:04:44,928 --> 02:04:45,952
Not to sell any

2738
02:04:47,488 --> 02:04:48,768
But I mean they are

2739
02:04:49,536 --> 02:04:53,376
Today is not even to sell you food they're selling out faster than get it

2740
02:04:54,144 --> 02:04:55,424
It's a breakdown the fact that

2741
02:04:56,448 --> 02:04:56,960
Call

2742
02:04:57,984 --> 02:04:59,008
Few days ago and I said

2743
02:04:59,264 --> 02:05:01,056
I'm getting calls at the food selling out

2744
02:05:01,568 --> 02:05:04,640
They're gearing up for some big emergency do you know about this

2745
02:05:05,408 --> 02:05:08,224
You tell me if there's been big governmental buyers coming to United listen

2746
02:05:08,736 --> 02:05:09,504
It's a secret

2747
02:05:10,528 --> 02:05:11,552
We've had the general

2748
02:05:11,808 --> 02:05:13,344
Services Administration

2749
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:15,904
Coming.

2750
02:05:16,160 --> 02:05:16,928
Find a vibe

2751
02:05:17,440 --> 02:05:18,208
Everything we've got

2752
02:05:18,720 --> 02:05:21,536
Because all the other major Food Distributors are either sold out

2753
02:05:22,048 --> 02:05:23,072
The closest selling out

2754
02:05:23,328 --> 02:05:25,120
So if you understand the Dynamics

2755
02:05:25,376 --> 02:05:26,400
It's going on here

2756
02:05:26,656 --> 02:05:29,984
Supply is not on to self

2757
02:05:30,240 --> 02:05:32,032
Panic that there is no food

2758
02:05:35,104 --> 02:05:41,248
I don't know why he's not just leaning into this Narrative of like if the institutional buyers are buying up all the

2759
02:05:41,504 --> 02:05:43,808
The food we're selling it to you

2760
02:05:44,064 --> 02:05:45,600
Keep them from getting it

2761
02:05:45,856 --> 02:05:49,696
So people get their food and not the Institute Patriot Supply does

2762
02:05:49,952 --> 02:05:50,464
Make that point

2763
02:05:50,720 --> 02:05:53,792
But that's what you lean into you don't do this

2764
02:05:54,048 --> 02:05:57,888
Wishi-washi I'm not going to put you on this food I'm putting you on the food but I'm not

2765
02:05:58,144 --> 02:06:03,008
But I am I'm a straight shooter who's lying to you as we speak right I think it's because Alex is getting good

2766
02:06:03,264 --> 02:06:04,032
Done some pushback

2767
02:06:04,288 --> 02:06:08,640
About that I saw certainly posted on Twitter

2768
02:06:08,896 --> 02:06:10,944
What people like in crisis

2769
02:06:11,200 --> 02:06:11,712
She's like this

2770
02:06:11,968 --> 02:06:12,992
Scam artists

2771
02:06:13,248 --> 02:06:17,088
Are opportunistic and they this is where they try and make it there

2772
02:06:17,344 --> 02:06:20,416
Their bread and their logo I really need a header image

2773
02:06:20,672 --> 02:06:22,208
Johnny was Alex and bike that horse

2774
02:06:22,464 --> 02:06:22,976
So like

2775
02:06:23,232 --> 02:06:25,024
I know that he knows if people are like

2776
02:06:25,792 --> 02:06:28,096
And he knows that he's doing it

2777
02:06:28,352 --> 02:06:29,632
Right

2778
02:06:30,144 --> 02:06:33,216
Same Dynamic with Ezra Levant

2779
02:06:38,592 --> 02:06:40,896
Do you got these

2780
02:06:41,152 --> 02:06:41,920
Personal buyers

2781
02:06:42,176 --> 02:06:43,200
Buying up food

2782
02:06:44,992 --> 02:06:45,504
If that's

2783
02:06:45,760 --> 02:06:47,296
The case I would assume that it's

2784
02:06:47,552 --> 02:06:48,576
It's the same thing that happened

2785
02:06:48,832 --> 02:06:49,344
With like

2786
02:06:49,856 --> 02:06:51,904
The the emergency

2787
02:06:52,160 --> 02:06:53,440
Lima

2788
02:06:53,696 --> 02:06:55,744
Like of course they buy a lot of food

2789
02:06:56,256 --> 02:06:58,560
Which I don't know if it is

2790
02:06:58,816 --> 02:07:02,400
Please be supply chain because there are emergency

2791
02:07:02,912 --> 02:07:06,240
A lot of times you and small-scale emergencies that we don't know about

2792
02:07:06,496 --> 02:07:07,520
They have to respond to

2793
02:07:08,032 --> 02:07:09,312
You know it's not always hurricane

2794
02:07:09,568 --> 02:07:12,640
There are smaller scale earthquakes

2795
02:07:12,896 --> 02:07:13,664
Soror

2796
02:07:13,920 --> 02:07:15,200
Droughts or floods

2797
02:07:15,712 --> 02:07:17,760
And they need food to be

2798
02:07:18,016 --> 02:07:18,784
Be able to

2799
02:07:19,040 --> 02:07:19,808
Keep people alive

2800
02:07:20,064 --> 02:07:21,088
Right so it wouldn't

2801
02:07:21,600 --> 02:07:22,624
Surprising to me if

2802
02:07:22,880 --> 02:07:23,648
They did

2803
02:07:24,160 --> 02:07:24,928
Some people

2804
02:07:25,184 --> 02:07:26,976
Here's why I don't mind buying up

2805
02:07:27,232 --> 02:07:28,000
All the food

2806
02:07:28,256 --> 02:07:30,048
I do not

2807
02:07:30,304 --> 02:07:31,328
I don't buy this

2808
02:07:31,584 --> 02:07:32,864
Nothing at all mainly be

2809
02:07:33,120 --> 02:07:34,144
Because Alex just said that

2810
02:07:34,400 --> 02:07:34,912
They

2811
02:07:35,168 --> 02:07:35,680
Texted him

2812
02:07:35,936 --> 02:07:37,472
Looking to buy up all his food

2813
02:07:38,240 --> 02:07:41,312
If they had contacted him looking to buy up all this food

2814
02:07:41,568 --> 02:07:42,592
It would be sold

2815
02:07:42,848 --> 02:07:44,128
The moment they said I'm look

2816
02:07:44,384 --> 02:07:45,664
Looking to buy all hearing like

2817
02:07:45,920 --> 02:07:49,504
Give near me

2818
02:07:49,760 --> 02:07:50,528
They're only

2819
02:07:50,784 --> 02:07:52,576
Selling to the Patriot Alex

2820
02:07:53,088 --> 02:07:57,952
Would absolutely sell out his entire Warehouse of food if somebody called saying they want to buy your house

2821
02:07:59,744 --> 02:08:03,072
Food warehouse warehouse with all of his other shipment

2822
02:08:03,328 --> 02:08:04,352
Spell his website

2823
02:08:04,864 --> 02:08:09,728
Directly sends the orders to my Patriot Supply

2824
02:08:09,984 --> 02:08:10,752
He's very clear

2825
02:08:11,008 --> 02:08:13,056
He has no interaction with the food

2826
02:08:13,312 --> 02:08:16,128
In the past it's just been an Infowars sticker that's on there

2827
02:08:16,384 --> 02:08:19,200
And now it's even apparently not that cuz they don't to pay for stickers

2828
02:08:19,456 --> 02:08:19,968
His intellect

2829
02:08:20,224 --> 02:08:21,760
But the food is the $4 bill

2830
02:08:22,016 --> 02:08:24,576
Is the $4 extra that you pay for it

2831
02:08:24,832 --> 02:08:25,600
No ability

2832
02:08:25,856 --> 02:08:26,624
You to sell to these instead

2833
02:08:26,880 --> 02:08:27,392
Do snow tires

2834
02:08:28,672 --> 02:08:30,208
Contact him he's just speaking

2835
02:08:30,464 --> 02:08:32,768
Precisely they contacted my Patriot Supply

2836
02:08:33,024 --> 02:08:35,584
Gotcha and my Patriot Supply told Alex about the

2837
02:08:35,840 --> 02:08:36,352
This contact they

2838
02:08:37,120 --> 02:08:40,448
Now they talk about that a little bit more specifically it in this next clip

2839
02:08:40,704 --> 02:08:41,472
And I mean

2840
02:08:41,984 --> 02:08:44,032
If you want to point a finger you know where to point it

2841
02:08:44,288 --> 02:08:45,568
Just started in November

2842
02:08:47,104 --> 02:08:47,872
I started getting

2843
02:08:48,384 --> 02:08:49,152
Females

2844
02:08:49,664 --> 02:08:51,200
Phone calls from different people

2845
02:08:51,712 --> 02:08:55,040
From government basically

2846
02:08:55,552 --> 02:08:57,344
Trying to get into the system

2847
02:08:57,600 --> 02:09:00,928
Where you can get Jesse contracts to work with

2848
02:09:05,280 --> 02:09:07,584
Registration is confiscation

2849
02:09:07,840 --> 02:09:11,424
We will never do that will not sell to the government my Patriots

2850
02:09:13,984 --> 02:09:17,568
If this happened in November it's having sense November guess what

2851
02:09:18,080 --> 02:09:19,360
F****** call your boy Trump

2852
02:09:21,152 --> 02:09:25,248
This is all Trump Administration stuff if it is some sort of a nefarious plan

2853
02:09:25,504 --> 02:09:26,272
So hey

2854
02:09:26,784 --> 02:09:28,064
Talk to your boy

2855
02:09:29,088 --> 02:09:34,464
Stop complaining on the radio cuz the only function of this is to try and sell these goddamn food yeah that's that's

2856
02:09:34,720 --> 02:09:36,768
It's weird this whole thing is made up now

2857
02:09:37,280 --> 02:09:37,792
Right

2858
02:09:38,048 --> 02:09:39,584
So basically the government

2859
02:09:39,840 --> 02:09:40,608
They get really defensive

2860
02:09:40,864 --> 02:09:44,704
Pensive about this idea that like it is a good idea to have

2861
02:09:44,960 --> 02:09:47,008
So I'm emergency rations on hand

2862
02:09:47,520 --> 02:09:50,080
And I have a thought about this on the other side of the

2863
02:09:50,592 --> 02:09:51,872
Last week going

2864
02:09:53,408 --> 02:09:54,944
Episode I'm ordering gas mask

2865
02:09:55,456 --> 02:09:57,248
I should be promoting this my audience

2866
02:09:57,504 --> 02:09:59,040
We shouldn't be ashamed of that

2867
02:09:59,552 --> 02:10:01,856
We should be proud that we are warning Americans

2868
02:10:05,440 --> 02:10:07,232
Hurricane right

2869
02:10:08,256 --> 02:10:12,352
What American State win any hurricanes approaching

2870
02:10:13,888 --> 02:10:16,448
And so young people running for parents stories days in advance

2871
02:10:18,240 --> 02:10:18,752
Here

2872
02:10:19,008 --> 02:10:23,616
Come to pass it may not come to pass and always

2873
02:10:25,152 --> 02:10:25,920
I'm not cooked

2874
02:10:26,176 --> 02:10:30,016
Teaching my Patriot Supply guy nearly as much as I am Alex

2875
02:10:31,296 --> 02:10:35,904
This conversation about like yeah if you're in let's say the middle of Missouri

2876
02:10:36,416 --> 02:10:39,232
It is wise to have some canned food in your basement

2877
02:10:39,488 --> 02:10:41,536
In case there's a tornado or something like that

2878
02:10:42,048 --> 02:10:43,840
It is wise to have

2879
02:10:44,096 --> 02:10:45,888
Spare tire in your car

2880
02:10:46,144 --> 02:10:51,264
Put a nice put ice in the freezer put water put water bottles in the freezer and then yeah you're cool

2881
02:10:51,520 --> 02:10:53,056
These sorts of things are

2882
02:10:53,312 --> 02:10:53,824
Not

2883
02:10:55,360 --> 02:10:56,128
Wise things

2884
02:10:56,384 --> 02:10:57,664
What's to do if a blanket in your car

2885
02:10:58,176 --> 02:10:58,688
Mel

2886
02:10:58,944 --> 02:11:00,992
If you are in the middle of Missouri

2887
02:11:01,248 --> 02:11:06,112
And you are trying to sell somebody something by screaming at them about tornadoes

2888
02:11:07,136 --> 02:11:08,160
You are being a dick

2889
02:11:10,464 --> 02:11:11,744
Maybe yes

2890
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,048
If you provide or offer

2891
02:11:14,304 --> 02:11:18,400
Survival food for somebody and recognize that in the case of an emergency

2892
02:11:18,656 --> 02:11:19,680
You might need this

2893
02:11:20,192 --> 02:11:20,704
Great

2894
02:11:20,960 --> 02:11:21,984
By all means

2895
02:11:22,496 --> 02:11:23,776
Sell your product in good health

2896
02:11:24,544 --> 02:11:27,360
If you were selling it by escalating

2897
02:11:27,616 --> 02:11:29,408
Annex surrounding a situation

2898
02:11:29,664 --> 02:11:31,968
Especially the way Alex is completely

2899
02:11:32,224 --> 02:11:34,016
Lying about f****** memes

2900
02:11:34,272 --> 02:11:35,552
About to Coronavirus

2901
02:11:36,064 --> 02:11:37,856
What you were doing is your

2902
02:11:38,112 --> 02:11:39,904
You're engaging a dishonest business

2903
02:11:40,160 --> 02:11:41,952
Absolutely

2904
02:11:44,512 --> 02:11:46,304
Thing to do which is prepare

2905
02:11:46,560 --> 02:11:47,584
In some way for a

2906
02:11:47,840 --> 02:11:48,352
Potential

2907
02:11:48,608 --> 02:11:50,144
Emergency and what you're doing

2908
02:11:54,496 --> 02:11:55,264
And that's

2909
02:11:55,520 --> 02:11:57,312
That's that's taking something rational

2910
02:11:57,568 --> 02:11:58,080
Turning in tomorrow

2911
02:11:58,336 --> 02:11:59,104
I hate

2912
02:11:59,360 --> 02:11:59,872
Yep

2913
02:12:00,128 --> 02:12:01,408
F****** hate I

2914
02:12:01,664 --> 02:12:02,432
And that's Bass

2915
02:12:02,688 --> 02:12:03,200
Musically like

2916
02:12:03,456 --> 02:12:04,224
This whole thing

2917
02:12:04,736 --> 02:12:05,248
It's all just

2918
02:12:05,760 --> 02:12:06,272
By the food

2919
02:12:06,528 --> 02:12:08,320
It's just a food

2920
02:12:08,576 --> 02:12:10,624
There's just no other way to put it then

2921
02:12:10,880 --> 02:12:11,392
You're scamming

2922
02:12:12,160 --> 02:12:14,208
That's that's it you're uploading

2923
02:12:14,464 --> 02:12:14,976
That's like

2924
02:12:15,232 --> 02:12:18,560
That's like it to carry your analogy still further

2925
02:12:19,072 --> 02:12:20,096
Like if your

2926
02:12:20,352 --> 02:12:23,680
Screaming at a man in the middle of Missouri about

2927
02:12:23,936 --> 02:12:25,216
F****** volcanoes

2928
02:12:25,984 --> 02:12:30,848
And saying that that's what you're going to need the food for her because the government of volcanic activity

2929
02:12:31,104 --> 02:12:34,432
Yeah yeah or hurricanes there's that there's going to be a massive

2930
02:12:34,688 --> 02:12:37,248
Missouri hurricane hurricane

2931
02:12:38,016 --> 02:12:39,296
So Alex

2932
02:12:41,856 --> 02:12:42,368
Problem is

2933
02:12:42,624 --> 02:12:44,672
These institutional buyers are buying up all the food

2934
02:12:45,696 --> 02:12:47,232
What makes this clip a little weird

2935
02:12:47,488 --> 02:12:52,096
Literally like 15 contacting me I just said okay

2936
02:12:52,352 --> 02:12:58,496
What's your background you got a big Supply there like watching don't you guys do is why I chose you many years ago

2937
02:12:58,752 --> 02:13:00,800
To get a good

2938
02:13:01,056 --> 02:13:07,200
Respond so they treat me like I want to be treated so let's come back and talk about kind of them

2939
02:13:07,456 --> 02:13:13,600
Play that started in and how it build up to where it is now you guys are buying up all the food around the Sun

2940
02:13:13,856 --> 02:13:17,440
Convoys of 18-wheelers

2941
02:13:23,840 --> 02:13:24,864
Alright whatever

2942
02:13:25,632 --> 02:13:26,400
Anyway

2943
02:13:27,680 --> 02:13:28,704
What are these big things

2944
02:13:30,752 --> 02:13:31,264
Flex uses

2945
02:13:31,520 --> 02:13:32,800
You don't hear anyone else

2946
02:13:33,056 --> 02:13:34,848
Ever use that is

2947
02:13:35,104 --> 02:13:35,616
Redoubt

2948
02:13:36,384 --> 02:13:37,664
We talked about people

2949
02:13:37,920 --> 02:13:39,968
Another globalist have their armored redoubts

2950
02:13:40,224 --> 02:13:43,040
Scores in New Zealand and I all over the place

2951
02:13:43,296 --> 02:13:44,064
Somewhere in Hawaii

2952
02:13:45,600 --> 02:13:46,112
Interesting

2953
02:13:46,368 --> 02:13:47,392
Graphic novel about the

2954
02:13:47,904 --> 02:13:48,416
Call Lazarus

2955
02:13:48,672 --> 02:13:54,816
Surprise you to learn that Alex has his own

2956
02:13:55,840 --> 02:13:56,864
Would be surprised to learn

2957
02:13:57,120 --> 02:13:57,888
Father

2958
02:13:58,656 --> 02:14:00,960
Being charged for the future

2959
02:14:01,216 --> 02:14:03,776
You know I'm outside

2960
02:14:04,032 --> 02:14:05,568
In 45 Acres with a

2961
02:14:06,336 --> 02:14:07,360
Done saving food

2962
02:14:07,616 --> 02:14:08,128
Because

2963
02:14:09,152 --> 02:14:10,688
Living in fear I'm living empowered

2964
02:14:11,200 --> 02:14:15,552
He has an armored he has an armored word out a little bit outside of Austin

2965
02:14:15,808 --> 02:14:16,576
With guns

2966
02:14:16,832 --> 02:14:17,600
And food

2967
02:14:17,856 --> 02:14:18,368
Okay

2968
02:14:18,624 --> 02:14:19,136
Alright

2969
02:14:19,392 --> 02:14:19,904
Thanks Ali

2970
02:14:20,672 --> 02:14:22,464
Where is it you want to give us the address makes

2971
02:14:22,720 --> 02:14:27,328
Because if I'm going to become a cannibal in 10 days after the end I'm going to your f****** house

2972
02:14:27,840 --> 02:14:31,936
This is this is where it all just like every single thing that he talks about the globalist

2973
02:14:32,192 --> 02:14:35,776
Doing it seems like you just wait around long enough and he talked about doing it himself

2974
02:14:36,288 --> 02:14:38,848
LeVar Burton

2975
02:14:40,640 --> 02:14:42,944
It is very much like he thinks that

2976
02:14:43,456 --> 02:14:44,992
The way he thinks is the way they thing

2977
02:14:45,248 --> 02:14:47,296
So of course he's doing what they're doing

2978
02:14:47,808 --> 02:14:48,320
Is he thinking that

2979
02:14:48,576 --> 02:14:49,856
Take it a step back

2980
02:14:50,112 --> 02:14:53,440
Night Like This is whole idea about these glove us having our bird out just like they can

2981
02:14:53,696 --> 02:14:54,720
Can wait out the consequence

2982
02:14:54,976 --> 02:14:56,000
This is the things they've done

2983
02:14:56,256 --> 02:14:57,024
If you take a

2984
02:14:57,280 --> 02:15:03,424
The broader Alex

2985
02:15:05,728 --> 02:15:06,496
I don't know

2986
02:15:06,752 --> 02:15:11,360
He's really trying to sell this food in doing so he ends up in points

2987
02:15:12,128 --> 02:15:12,640
Pretty

2988
02:15:12,896 --> 02:15:13,408
Ridiculous

2989
02:15:13,920 --> 02:15:14,688
Things like

2990
02:15:15,712 --> 02:15:16,992
Idea of

2991
02:15:17,248 --> 02:15:19,040
During the Great Depression

2992
02:15:20,064 --> 02:15:22,880
In 1929 to about 1938 + 39

2993
02:15:23,648 --> 02:15:26,464
Major Universe win

2994
02:15:26,976 --> 02:15:28,256
That is a

2995
02:15:28,512 --> 02:15:34,656
Figure I cannot find anywhere we we had a greater famine than chair

2996
02:15:34,912 --> 02:15:35,936
Chairman Mao in China

2997
02:15:36,192 --> 02:15:39,264
I can that what we're talkin about

2998
02:15:39,520 --> 02:15:40,032
I can't find it

2999
02:15:40,288 --> 02:15:41,824
Toronto articles about how

3000
02:15:42,080 --> 02:15:44,128
Because of social welfare programs

3001
02:15:44,384 --> 02:15:46,176
Actually a lot of people received

3002
02:15:46,432 --> 02:15:47,200
From starvation

3003
02:15:47,456 --> 02:15:48,992
Galax probably doesn't want to consider

3004
02:15:49,248 --> 02:15:51,040
17 million is an outrage

3005
02:15:51,296 --> 02:15:55,648
Just figured absolutely

3006
02:15:55,904 --> 02:15:56,928
Figures like that

3007
02:15:57,184 --> 02:16:00,256
Is to make people like hey you know I don't want to be one of those 17 million

3008
02:16:01,280 --> 02:16:02,560
Better by the survival food

3009
02:16:02,816 --> 02:16:04,096
All TaylorMade

3010
02:16:04,352 --> 02:16:06,144
Direct people towards

3011
02:16:07,424 --> 02:16:09,216
So anyway the other thing Tuesday

3012
02:16:09,472 --> 02:16:11,008
The Alex is

3013
02:16:11,264 --> 02:16:11,776
It's pretty clear

3014
02:16:12,032 --> 02:16:15,360
It is time they need to buy this food to the virus

3015
02:16:16,128 --> 02:16:19,456
It does creep me out that I didn't think about this until I called you guys

3016
02:16:19,712 --> 02:16:25,856
Opera

3017
02:16:26,112 --> 02:16:27,904
3 days

3018
02:16:28,160 --> 02:16:31,232
You never liked promote that's because

3019
02:16:31,744 --> 02:16:33,536
Maybe a month or dummy

3020
02:16:34,048 --> 02:16:37,376
So you been a little bit concerned about what's going on it is kind of scared me a little bit

3021
02:16:38,400 --> 02:16:44,544
So when we saw it last week and moving into full motion saying hey this is

3022
02:16:45,824 --> 02:16:48,384
Everyday

3023
02:16:48,896 --> 02:16:51,456
So there is there is a

3024
02:16:51,712 --> 02:16:52,992
Italian of the

3025
02:16:53,248 --> 02:16:54,784
The situation with the virus

3026
02:16:55,040 --> 02:16:56,320
We need to buy food

3027
02:16:56,576 --> 02:16:57,344
Now you have

3028
02:16:57,856 --> 02:16:58,624
Essentially

3029
02:16:59,136 --> 02:17:00,160
Like a fool

3030
02:17:00,928 --> 02:17:02,208
Sensationalism

3031
02:17:02,464 --> 02:17:02,976
You have

3032
02:17:03,488 --> 02:17:04,512
Calls to action

3033
02:17:04,768 --> 02:17:05,536
You have

3034
02:17:06,816 --> 02:17:08,352
Weird vague

3035
02:17:08,864 --> 02:17:13,984
Idea that the government's buying up all the food I'm surprised they didn't put a clock on like a special

3036
02:17:14,496 --> 02:17:15,008
You know

3037
02:17:15,264 --> 02:17:17,056
They are not going to do that well

3038
02:17:17,312 --> 02:17:20,640
Not exactly but that is exactly the last element

3039
02:17:20,896 --> 02:17:23,968
That you need to make this a full infomercial

3040
02:17:24,736 --> 02:17:26,016
It's not the same as like on QVC

3041
02:17:26,272 --> 02:17:28,064
8:20

3042
02:17:31,136 --> 02:17:31,904
Love the fact

3043
02:17:32,416 --> 02:17:33,440
During regular time

3044
02:17:34,464 --> 02:17:36,256
Great food water filtration United

3045
02:17:36,512 --> 02:17:40,608
Hyderabad times they get it that scares me though you're saying 23 weeks

3046
02:17:41,120 --> 02:17:45,984
That is scary

3047
02:17:46,240 --> 02:17:51,872
Thank you so much and go to infowarsstore.com the fun. She's all dropped at the same day

3048
02:17:52,640 --> 02:17:53,920
I mean you have the eye

3049
02:17:54,176 --> 02:17:55,968
Did the presentation that there is

3050
02:17:56,224 --> 02:18:02,368
You've only got two or three weeks now but you're running out of time

3051
02:18:03,904 --> 02:18:05,952
It's just a just a name

3052
02:18:06,208 --> 02:18:06,976
Your wife

3053
02:18:07,232 --> 02:18:08,256
By the book

3054
02:18:08,768 --> 02:18:11,072
Sort of infomercial for this food

3055
02:18:11,840 --> 02:18:15,168
That brings us to the end of this January 31st

3056
02:18:15,424 --> 02:18:16,192
2020

3057
02:18:16,448 --> 02:18:16,960
Episode

3058
02:18:18,240 --> 02:18:18,752
Wolf

3059
02:18:20,800 --> 02:18:22,080
I don't

3060
02:18:22,336 --> 02:18:22,848
Think he did a

3061
02:18:23,104 --> 02:18:23,616
Great job

3062
02:18:23,872 --> 02:18:25,152
Is that right

3063
02:18:25,920 --> 02:18:29,504
Interesting review I think it's performance left something to be desired

3064
02:18:30,016 --> 02:18:33,856
The God hates cowards thing that's a standout

3065
02:18:34,368 --> 02:18:38,464
Not the voice actor in claims and the Resident Evil references

3066
02:18:39,232 --> 02:18:42,560
Not vs Levante crying like a baby

3067
02:18:42,816 --> 02:18:45,376
I I couldn't pay attention through the I was talk

3068
02:18:45,632 --> 02:18:46,400
That was tough

3069
02:18:46,656 --> 02:18:47,680
I was listening to that

3070
02:18:47,936 --> 02:18:50,496
The episode and I had to

3071
02:18:50,752 --> 02:18:51,264
I had to stop

3072
02:18:51,520 --> 02:18:52,288
A couple times

3073
02:18:52,544 --> 02:18:54,336
Like Knock-Knock is how long they can get

3074
02:18:56,384 --> 02:18:56,896
An hour or so

3075
02:18:57,920 --> 02:18:58,432
Capping like

3076
02:18:59,200 --> 02:18:59,968
Cannot do this

3077
02:19:00,480 --> 02:19:01,504
I'm so bored

3078
02:19:02,016 --> 02:19:02,528
This is such a

3079
02:19:02,784 --> 02:19:04,064
Transparent thing

3080
02:19:04,320 --> 02:19:07,136
Unappealing

3081
02:19:08,416 --> 02:19:09,952
But I mean you see the directions

3082
02:19:10,208 --> 02:19:10,976
The show is going at

3083
02:19:11,488 --> 02:19:12,256
That accelerating

3084
02:19:12,512 --> 02:19:14,048
Full steam ahead on trying

3085
02:19:14,304 --> 02:19:16,608
Create Panic surrounding this Coronavirus

3086
02:19:16,864 --> 02:19:18,912
It's full steam ahead

3087
02:19:19,168 --> 02:19:21,984
Monetizing it whether it be through

3088
02:19:22,496 --> 02:19:26,592
Real JC headed areas with the silver

3089
02:19:26,848 --> 02:19:27,872
And just

3090
02:19:28,128 --> 02:19:28,640
