1
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for knowledge B

2
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

3
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,136
Nike.com

4
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,536
Everybody looks around technology Beverages and talk a little bit about Alex Jones

5
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:09,120
Jordan Jordan

6
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:10,144
I have a quick question

7
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:10,912
What up

8
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:14,240
That my bright spot back to

9
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:20,128
The act like real Chucky came back and came back from the grocery store and back from the grocery store

10
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:23,200
Yeah it is and that's why I actually feel like I'm

11
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:27,808
Doing the thing that I set out to do instead of like looking at Owen

12
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:29,856
Troyer feeling in and blow like

13
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:30,880
What are we where is he

14
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:34,464
Yeah what is going on and his stories of his time away

15
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:41,632
Not to be believed. Very excited too much

16
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:45,984
Is that okay

17
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:52,384
Okay at the new genres it feels good to be back in studio to be full of s***

18
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,920
And I enjoyed

19
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:57,760
Bright spot is it is

20
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:59,040
Part of me

21
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:04,672
Alex would give up the whole radio thing and I have become kind of a troll that lives in the grocery store

22
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:06,464
In like the Mexican food section

23
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,024
Just pop it out and be like

24
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,584
Yeah I like about the big enchilada

25
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,424
We're going to get to the big enchilada as Africa's next break

26
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,520
Apparently this grocery stores racist at me

27
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:21,312
I feel like Alex

28
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:24,640
Fit in in the deli I don't know

29
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:28,992
Here's the interesting thing about that grocery store shows that it's also like a big restaurant

30
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,576
Large Market

31
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:33,344
Slash

32
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:35,136
Alex Azar

33
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:35,904
If you will

34
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,184
What's good like cleanup

35
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,280
Maybe I don't know I wouldn't I wouldn't hire a nuisance like a bad employee

36
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:43,840
They do me like eventually we're going to see the

37
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:46,400
A remake of the wrestler but it's just

38
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:50,240
Lot of lot of that movie will be about coordination

39
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:53,312
On the part of Alex as an employee I don't think you take the rec

40
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:56,128
Action well

41
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:01,760
My bright spot then is Benjamin

42
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:04,576
He's great I was I was watching some Bob's Burger

43
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:10,976
Fantastic

44
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:17,376
Whether or not it was him with the capital

45
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,424
But then I started thinking about it I really

46
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:23,264
I've been listening to H John Benjamin since I was like

47
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,288
Hand doctor

48
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:26,592
Call movies yeah.

49
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:29,152
From the jump I was watching dr. Katz

50
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:31,712
I'd like a little kid and

51
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:38,112
And now I'm a full-grown prayer that H-Town regiment is still in my life yeah it is interesting

52
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:40,416
Think about I don't know if I have gone a year

53
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:41,696
Archer

54
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:45,024
Daughter

55
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:50,400
Yeah probably not he's even had his own shows on Comedy Central Network

56
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:51,680
Incredibly short-lived

57
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:56,544
I think he's been everywhere 20 years at least

58
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,104
Until I wanted to celebrate

59
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,736
That I've always enjoy each other Benjamin in my life I ever had a moment where I was like

60
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:05,504
Too much

61
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,064
Yeah for sure

62
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,624
Stand-ups that was really funny

63
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:17,024
Me too like from that invite them up CD totally forget a Buddies

64
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,119
Photo of him like a genuine

65
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,423
One of it one of our generation

66
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,959
Great comedic talents

67
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,239
And I

68
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:31,615
So jealous of his career in terms of like how famous he is

69
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:36,991
Probably Gomez

70
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:41,599
Perfect family as long as he does like a slightly different voice

71
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:42,623
Fly by

72
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,671
People bothering him probably

73
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:47,743
And also it's not like he's

74
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:51,839
A guy who got famous for doing so many different voices

75
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,631
His voice

76
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:56,191
Mostly just a little little bit different

77
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:56,959
Edit

78
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:57,983
Perfect every

79
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:02,079
So anyway Jordan let's get down to business

80
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:06,687
Today we're going to be doing is talking about how March 15th and 16th 2021

81
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:19,999
Closest dump

82
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,023
Did not

83
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,839
Well alright

84
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:27,167
I was thinking about

85
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:29,215
This is kind of an indication of how like

86
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:31,775
My brain went to some Flights of Fancy

87
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,311
Like a regular like

88
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:34,847
The 14

89
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:35,871
The pie day

90
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:36,895
3.14

91
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:37,663
Right

92
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,199
50s is the Ides of March

93
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:40,991
16th is 36

94
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,783
Steve Austin 3:16

95
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,319
Naturally this is a big

96
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:48,159
I don't know I don't know if there are like

97
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:52,255
Obviously there's like a Christmas Eve Christmas boxing day kind of thing

98
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,791
Kind of related

99
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:55,583
Birthday this year

100
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:58,399
I think Saint Patrick's Day weekend with this last weekend

101
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:05,055
We already have it I know they turn the river Green in Chicago

102
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:09,151
Patrick's Day throwing up on walls

103
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:09,919
Terrible

104
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,247
I don't miss when I used to live over by Clark's

105
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,063
Wrigley Field

106
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,087
That was a menace

107
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:20,159
Friend talked me into going

108
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,439
Link to that Sluggers

109
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:27,839
That bar that has a batting cage on the second floor.

110
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:33,215
Humanity that you were so proud that you're still here

111
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,775
Yeah it was touch-and-go for a little bit

112
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:42,175
Three stretch days of holidays that are really holidays

113
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:47,295
We're back to Alex Jones

114
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,111

Nothing birthday anybody get married

118
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:00,607
No no no marriages but I remember

119
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:03,423
But then we got to do we have to have a symposium

120

Business

134
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,527
Money off that heroin

135
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,367
Usually large

136
00:07:55,647 --> 00:08:01,791
Chocolate in your area and corn dog

00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:10,495
Behind on some messages I lose track of somebody inbox

140
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:11,519
That's all

141
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:15,615
I sometimes don't see some of these birthday shout-outs and I feel bad

142
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,151
With a couple of these shout-outs today

143
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:23,551
Belated birthday would be like for $5 in a cup

144
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:26,367
3 weeks light this is from

145
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,159
March 22nd

146
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:28,927
2020

147
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:31,743
It's not that far

148
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:34,047
You know what I want to do I want

149
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:37,119
Institute a new thing because this is getting to be too much and I love

150
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,143
Making

151
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,423
Can people's birthday special

152
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,191
I love

153
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,727
Being able to do that

154
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:43,007
We going to do this once a month

155
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,543
Birthday Roundup

156
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,567
Brooklyn

157
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,103
So from now on

158
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:49,151
By the end of the month

159
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,711
If you want to send me a birthday shout-out

160
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:52,991
Do you want us to do

161
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,271
For the next month

162
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,039
Will do it

163
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:59,391
I'll probably lose track of some

164
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,927
This isn't going to work

165
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:10,143
Do you like any solution that doesn't have anything to do with the problem which is that we're terrible with correspondence

166
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,727
Terrible.

167
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,263
Certain things in order

168
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,543
In my head

169
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:23,199
It's unfortunate that we live in a world where we read every male and responded are headed then forget to actually do it

170
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:26,783
Is a big problem that I have

171
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:29,343
I'm just a little bit too old I was born

172
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,111
Maybe a couple

173
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,647
Who years earlier I would have

174
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:33,183
Really integrated a lot of

175
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,719
New technologies in Troy

176
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,767
Sure organization in like

177
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:37,791
I don't know

178
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:41,119
What is what is what does QuickBooks for a to-do list

179
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,399
Yeah but it goes

180
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:48,799
It goes a little too far sometimes you know like my partnership she'll respond to emails from students at like 10 or 10

181
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:55,199
P.m. because it shows up on her phone you know and that's not a good work like that might be better though

182
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,223
In terms of like

183
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:57,247
And things

184
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:59,551
Moving you

185
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,575
Is that

186
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:02,623

Episode to go over whole lot of bulshit

199
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:29,247
Of

200
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,551
Another context drop I wanted to do something

201
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,831
Sing a little bit special

202
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:35,135

00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:52,543
Jason pohlman go drink some water

208
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:59,199
Now when you say airplane

209
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,479
Not drink

210
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,503
The water

211
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,271

213
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:06,111
Absolutely 2nd Hysteria

214
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,415
I have water samples

215
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:23,519
Unscientific

216
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:28,127
Water

217
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:34,527
Drink some goddamn water alright

218
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:38,879
He's been gone for for a week and I was

219
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:45,535
I was interested to see how he was going to return he came in and described him as dramatic and

220
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,303
A little

221
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,071
Lowrider

222
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:52,959
Sister comes back from his weird vacations usually what he's got a day wears a little bit.

223
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:54,495
He's a little sleepy

224
00:11:54,751 --> 00:12:00,895
Ladies and gentlemen we could not be doing more important work right now

225
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,687
A house right now

226
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,551
Almost live March 15th

227
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:09,087
Monday Global transmission

228
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,879
The Ides of March

229
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,559
I am going to

230
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,607
Arrow special

231
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:24,447
And then when I return

232
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,471
Get into the

233
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:28,799
Months that are unfolding

234
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:31,359
Here today

235
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,639
Weird vibe

236
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:34,175
I'm going to start the show

237
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:38,015
And then leave

238
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:40,831
It's a weird vibe but it's also not that weird

239
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,879
From listening to show a lot

240
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,159
It's fairly like

241
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:44,927
Dura Dura

242
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:46,719
Expense

243
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,487
It is weird

244
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,023
It's a strange vibe

245
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,071
There's something going on

246
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:53,887
And then I realized what it was later Alex reviews

247
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:57,471
So the mystery will be solved why is Alex so weird

248
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,775
Probably break down some of the big headlines

249
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,055
Like a

250
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,335
Great Marvin Hagler

251
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,615
Dog pregnancy

252
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,663
You don't just have

253
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,711
Marvelous Marvin Hagler

254
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,783
A day after the vaccine

255
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:13,599
You know just have Hank Aaron dying

256
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:20,767
Applying and battling to keep that information coming out from the families

257
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,559
Because they can cover up

258
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:25,631
People dying it's hard to cover up Sports icon

259
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:31,775
Took the idea that boxing great Marvin Hagler died after getting a covid-19 vaccine didn't come from any solid

260
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,567
Reporting that Alex is working off of

261
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,407
Do you think that information from a random Facebook post buy another box

262
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:40,479
Hagar's wife Kay has come out been clear that this

263
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:42,783
This is not the case somebody passed away from natural causes

264
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:48,671
I can't determine whether or not Hagler had been vaccinated and if he had I have no idea when

265
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,207
You would have gotten the vaccine

266
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:54,815
My point here is that I really wanted demonstrate the flimsy level of information Alex works

267
00:13:55,583 --> 00:14:00,191
He has absolutely zero evidence past that Facebook post that hagler's death is related to a vaccination

268
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,495
That's sufficient for him to report it to

269
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,263
Definitively

270
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:05,311
No one interested in getting the story right

271
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,591
Possibly use that as a word

272
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,359
Workflow

273
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,919
Also there's been no evidence found that the guest

274
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:13,247
At the Hank Aaron's death was related to getting vaccinated two weeks prior

275
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,783
He was 86 years old

276
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:17,087
And who knows what else is there

277
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,135
Also Alex

278
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,439
Those two names specific

279
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,719
Out the fuk of

280
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:24,255
His mouth you'll be nice

281
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,559
Marvelous Marvin dealt with

282
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:27,839
So much

283
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:30,399
Goddamn racism from geizig

284
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:32,191
Exactly like f****** Alex

285
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,471
Hank Aaron

286
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:38,847
Dealt with so much f****** raises if you guys like f****** Alex keep their names out of there

287
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,127
Out of your mouth

288
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:43,199
I saw so as we know Alex was hanging out in a grocery

289
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,479
Restore for a little bit

290
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:46,527
It's early on in the show

291
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:49,855
He give us a little bit of an indication of what he might actually been

292
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,927
Might be doing something a little bit in the fairy okay

293
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:56,511
I'm honored to be back in studio with all of you

294
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:00,607
I had an amazingly powerful trip

295
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:05,471
In Florida that I'm not at Liberty to get into any of on

296
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,519
Basically but I will give you just some of the

297
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,055
Basics

298
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:13,151
Assistance for me

299
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:17,247
And also a sense of what this broadcast

300
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,015
Has.

301
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,319
I want this broadcast

302
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,343
Text husband table

303
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:29,279
Are you are you trying to imply that you raised an Army in Florida

304
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:33,375
Operations

305
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,911
I'm not entirely sure if he doesn't

306
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,727
He doesn't elaborate more until later but as this goes like

307
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,007
The f*** you talk

308
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:42,591
Talking about I talked to Rodger Stone 45 minutes

309
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:43,871
So I know that we're going to

310
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:46,431
Destroy the government Rodger and I were smoking

311
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,455
Cigars and

312
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:54,111
Wasted to that weird podcast

313
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:54,879
I know it's good weekend

314
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:59,231
Special Report that's why he doesn't elaborate more and

315
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:01,279
Man this is important stuff man

316
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:03,839

The performance you do not want to miss

327
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,927
Probably too much.

328
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:29,951
The narcissistic

329
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:30,719
Hacks

330
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:33,279
Who has hijacked the soul of American music

331
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:36,351
The real warship

332
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:38,655
Grammy-winning Legends Bobby Rush

333
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,471
John Prine Chikorita

334
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:45,311
And many others had been given a moment to receive their Awards

335
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:51,711
American Music they right

336
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:56,831
Man johnbowne is mad at the Grammy's who could have predicted

337
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:04,255
Yeah Infowars employee mad at Grammys

338
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:10,655
Yeah I was going to say oh my god oh no conservative men are unhappy with women and

339
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:14,751
When people pop culture music app

340
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:17,823
We lead I was also listening to this and there was a really

341
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:21,407
But there's a part in his report that made me look really fast

342
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,431
I think he's trolling

343
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,479
Yeah I don't think John bowne serious

344
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:26,271
I think he's f****** with people

345
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:28,319
Trying to get a rise out of them

346
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:31,903
So then he can talk about how everyone's mad at his stupid report

347
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:32,671
And here was that

348
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:35,231
All overseen by the self

349
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,791
Queen of Crowley in magic

350
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:41,887
Beyonce and Jay-Z

351
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:44,447
Because the

352
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:47,519
Real American music represent

353
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,079
Must never be allowed out of its paw

354
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,615
Which is buried

355
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:58,015
Beneath the Grammys

356
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:00,319
Craving it JonBenet

357
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,087
Reporting

358
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,367
Infowars

359
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:07,231
Tomorrow's news today I think he's f****** around like I was being serious

360
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:07,999
Yeah

361
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,279
Is being serious

362
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:11,327
Right like how much it is just

363
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:16,191
Goofing off and being a dumbass do you actually think that Beyonce does

364
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:17,983
Crowley and Magic course

365
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:22,591
Cuz I know that Alex would probably say that Aunt Leo Crowley

366
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,615
Adjectives

367
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:26,175
That's in line with the Infowars

368
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,455
Editorial position

369
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:29,247
They are witches and warlocks

370
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:34,111
I do appreciate here's how much Beyonce is the queen

371
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,391
Her enemies have

372
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:38,207
To describe her as a queen and some patch

373
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:41,535
Richie is a Powerhouse

374
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:42,559
Okay

375
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:44,607
So you might as well recontextualizing

376
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:46,399
Is it to her being a Powerhouse at Magic

377
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:48,191
Australian whiskey

378
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:49,215
Lady

379
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,031
Actually do

380
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:54,591
I think I think he's just

381
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:55,615
Do you know

382
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:59,199
Just trying to piss people off so just trying to be a dick about stuff

383
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:01,503
Said maybe people will pay attention to

384
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,831
Is this phone where I can make you like

385
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:11,743
Clickbait headline maybe we'll get a thousand more views on it

386
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:12,511
Absolutely

387
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,047
Do you say that Beyonce is a

388
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:15,839
The master of Crowley in magic

389
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:18,143
So we get back to Alex

390
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:23,007
After jump-outs very dumb report and you want to talk more about

391
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,055
Oh you're not going to see the

392
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:27,615
Produced establishment program

393
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:31,199
Talking about why are all of these old people and young people and

394
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:34,015
People and white people and others dying

395
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,551
MRNA vaccine

396
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:43,231
All of these baseball players in famous boxers

397
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:48,863
Shot

398
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,399
Totally healthy took

399
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:51,935
5 hours later

400
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:52,959
Is Libertyville

401
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:59,615
Oz reporting hagler's family is that the death is related to the officially challenge

402
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:00,639
Tubac reclaim up

403
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:04,223
The only statement I can find from his family's from his wife who said quote

404
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:07,039
Herscher wasn't the vaccine that caused his death

405
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:09,855
My baby left in peace with his usual smile

406
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:12,159
And now is not the time to talk nonsense

407
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:16,255
Alex needs to back up his claim or else he needs to retract this slanderous

408
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:17,535
Better Business

409
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,583
Apologize to the Hagler family

410
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,631
Their pain is not a prop for him to use the

411
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,911
To put anti-vax married

412
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,447
Is just horseshit

413
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,215
No

414
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:25,983
And

415
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:26,751
You know

416
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:29,055
He was a fighter

417
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:31,871
Took a lot of hits

418
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:34,431
And Marvelous Marvin was somewhat

419
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:36,479
Known for being willing to take a hit

420
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:39,807
Just keep coming and beat the s*** out of you

421
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:43,903
So I

422
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:44,671
I was

423
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:47,231
Like I said in a in a strange state where are they

424
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:53,631
Alex got a weird f****** energy at the beginning of this what's going on he's going to mediately to reports after being gone for a week

425
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:54,911
He be hungry

426
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,959
And then I realized what was going on

427
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:58,495
Ringo break

428
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:01,311
I'm going to come back with all the news but I wanted to get to that first

429
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:04,383
Broadcast

430
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:06,431
Barber shop

431
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:07,199
Earpiece problem

432
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:09,503
So we had to write

433
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:16,416
Do it

434
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:19,232
Because storage

435
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:25,376
I just realize though that it is Americans themselves

436
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:28,192
Resistance we don't have a

437
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:29,472
Future we don't have any

438
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:30,752
I should quit

439
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:37,152
Because my earpiece is f****** up and quite frankly none of you were fighting hard enough

440
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:43,552
So that puts me in a bad mood so I assume the lash out of you everything right and it's all your fault

441
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:49,184
Because I'm a whiny baby absolutely because

442
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,000
You people whiny baby who pays John bowne.

443
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:57,632
The most relevant thing to music

444
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:58,912
The dork

445
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:01,472
Anyway Alex gets back to his Florida

446
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:04,288
And here is where I started to get a sense of what

447
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:05,056
Might have been

448
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:05,824
Been going on

449
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,616
And I went to Florida

450
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:16,832
And I wouldn't even call mostly Secret

451
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:20,928
Exciting

452
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:22,464
The same message

453
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:25,024
By everyone that I spoke with

454
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:29,376
I'll just leave it at that

455
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:30,400
The top names

456
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,168
.

457
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:31,936
Florida

458
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,776
And the revolution

459
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,568
We need you

460
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,104
We're counting on you

461
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,152
We're counting on your listeners and

462
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,176
Sickly

463
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:42,944
That

464
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:44,736
We are the engine

465
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:46,016
That is driving

466
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,832
Most of the Rebellion

467
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:50,112
You see here today

468
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:51,136
Alex

469
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:57,536
Has been bestowed the title of the leader of the Rebellion

470
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:58,304
Talk to

471
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,168
We would know

472
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:06,496
It would have been reported on not I not only that

473
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:11,104
Alex would have shot a video there yeah yeah yeah but how I met with

474
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:17,504
Trump yeah but even even then even if it was like Trump wanted to let you know Trump and his team or like we're not actually

475
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,064
Because

476
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:22,368
You know

477
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,416
You know they don't even have to stay there

478
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:25,184
You know

479
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:31,584
But even then it would have been reported like Alex Jones seen walking into marahlago

480
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:37,216
For like Stephen Miller spotted at grocery store

481
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:43,616
Axis of Evil revive at grocery store

482
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:44,896
I think that the world

483
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:45,920
Bucked up that I

484
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:47,456
To believe that maybe he did talk

485
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,224
12

486
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:53,600
And I could also believe that he wants people to think that he just hung out with Rodger and a grocery store

487
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:57,184
And now he's annointed him bleeder

488
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,976
Yeah and I can also believe him

489
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:03,072
I'm telling Rodger Stone to tell Trump something is him be like

490
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:07,936
We have we have seen many instances of that over the course of the show

491
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,472
Bigwig

492
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:11,520
In the auntie globalist

493
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:15,872
Fight that Alex's is engaged at the leader of

494
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:16,896
Sure

495
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:17,920
Big Nate

496
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:19,712
Want to know like how do you know what

497
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:20,736
Oh man

498
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:22,016
You're so smart

499
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:22,784
Dreams

500
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,832
3 most prominent names

501
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:26,368
Ian

502
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:32,768
The countryside of the globalist all after the same question how did you know all that

503
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:37,888
I said whoa

504
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:40,960
Yeah there's a lot of

505
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:43,776
I know the key groups

506
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,568
They built so far

507
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,616
Predictive programming

508
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:49,408
So I know what they're going to do

509
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,992
And I said Well you certainly do know that

510
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:56,064
I met with the former head of to us intelligence agencies

511
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,344
I'll leave it at that

512
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:04,000
Experience

513
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:07,584
I cured covid-19

514
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:09,632
It was like 1,000 lb weight

515
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:14,240
Lot of weight on my shoulders but I've had this

516
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:17,056
And I've known it was my job but this time

517
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:18,080
Win

518
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:19,616
To do what we've done I told you that

519
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:23,712
Get out up front

520
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:25,504
So the others can interior the ball

521
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,784
I just literally

522
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:35,232
It was more like

523
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:37,280
This will happen this unfold

524
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,048
And the Mist

525
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,120
Stop

526
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:43,424
That I am inspired

527
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,216
With my discernment at my own research

528
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:47,776
To know what to look at to understand

529
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:50,336
And that my understanding of human nature

530
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,432
Was that on but that was all given to me by God

531
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:56,736
Smartest thing Rush Limbaugh

532
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:57,760
Said was

533
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:59,296
Talent on loan

534
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:00,320
From God

535
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:03,392
And so I just am very humbled to be here

536
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:05,696
Humble respectful to be with all of you

537
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:11,584
Time to get

538
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,496
40 minutes into the show Now isn't covered anything

539
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:23,616
I have I have written down the moment he said we do important work here I was gone

540
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:30,016
Let's just tally up some important work and we got we've got Marvelous Marvin and Hank Aaron we've got his mysterious

541
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:34,112
Strip x 20 we've got the Grammys on we've got my earpiece

542
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:35,392
Priest doesn't work

543
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:39,488
Important that special report

544
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:42,304
It's cuz he needed to fix his ear piece that was I was going on

545
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:47,680
All the many rambled a bunch about how he was anointed the king of the Patriots when he was hanging out in Florida so

546
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,216
Engraving

547
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:49,984
For Alex

548
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,544
Complain at this point that he doesn't have time to get to the real meat

549
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:54,080
Recover a properly

550
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:57,152
He has all the time in the world he just knows full well that

551
00:26:57,408 --> 00:27:00,224
If you ever tried to go anywhere deeper than surface-level on any of these

552
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,248
Restore easy covers

553
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:05,088
You become clear immediately but he has no idea what he's talking about and its arguments

554
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:05,856
Make no sense

555
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:13,536
Put up with him just rambling about God giving him a download or whatever happened career is going to be when everything is at

556
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:14,816
Direct contradiction

557
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:18,144
It's not like 20 years ago God told him

558
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,936
One day you will be

559
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:24,544
Foot soldier in Donald Trump's wall

560
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:29,152
Before he supported him out to start the truck was in the mob

561
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:35,808
I'm so disgusting

562
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:42,208
This way then sometimes that includes making you tell everybody that you're goddamn

563
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:44,256
Alex

564
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:48,608
Had like some kind of a download of what he was going to do and some kind of an idea of his

565
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:49,888
Future then like you

566
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:52,448
Couldn't have possibly known anything pass

567
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:54,496
Supporting Trump because

568
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:57,312
Fizz mid so

569
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:59,104
Avast departure from

570
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,664
God didn't tell him that part

571
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,432
Sure

572
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:07,296
Also I have I'm struggling to believe that you want to follow

573
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:12,928
Top names in anti globalism who are willing to take you at face value when they say

574
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,720
How do you know everything you know

575
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:17,024
Well I had a vision 20 years ago

576
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,072
I'm sorry I'm so sorry

577
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:22,144
You tell that to them you don't tell that to

578
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:28,544
Sorry but I don't imagine I conversation with anything like that

579
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,312
Yeah

580
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,104
What kind of stuff that happens

581
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:31,872
Is it like

582
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:32,640
I don't know

583
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:35,968
Aleister Crowley circles

584
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,832
I will tell you that the king of Crowley and Magic does also get visions

585
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:44,160
Yeah that's a place for that conversation. This dumb dumb s***

586
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:49,792
Anyway Alex headset like you said to me last clip you like you felt like a big weight was lifted from her

587
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,584
That's cuz he's kind of

588
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:52,864
Completed his mission

589
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:55,424
Don't feel like my missions over

590
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,472
Completed

591
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,776
What I was sent here to do

592
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:01,824
You've been sent to this planet as well

593
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:03,360
You're here

594
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:05,152
Why God created you

595
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:12,320
About

596
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:17,952
God literally had his hand

597
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,000
Do tell me all the same message

598
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:23,328
The same message take care of yourself

599
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,144
You help watch this whole thing you're even alone

600
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:31,776
Apologize

601
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:40,992
Now people are asking me what to do

602
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:42,016
Level

603
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:43,040
Specifically but

604
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:44,064
That

605
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,112
I completed the mission so far now

606
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:47,904
Now

607
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,184
And don't even need me

608
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:51,488
Space shuttle

609
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:53,280
The main boosters just fall off

610
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,560
Imagine being

611
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:07,872
You were the most yourself

612
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:11,712
The main fight this is all

613
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:15,296
Pre-positioning for what coming

614
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:17,856
Dog people versus Satan's people

615
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:20,160
This was setting up the chess pieces

616
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:23,232
Now ladies and gentlemen it is.

617
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,256
This is very stupid

618
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:29,376
I mean like honestly as somebody who listens to a ton of Alex

619
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:31,936
I mean like one of our episodes

620
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:34,240
The people like a lot was the episode

621
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:36,288
The drunk Hotel interview tomorrow

622
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:38,592
Patrick bet-david

623
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:43,456
It was

624
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:48,320
He completed his mission and things that are like

625
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:49,088
There it's

626
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:55,232
It just it's a it's a refrain that comes back this time to time whenever Alex Fields a certain way

627
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:57,280
But he talked

628
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:58,304
Just somebody

629
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,328
Maybe not Trump

630
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:01,632
But it's somebody who gave him like

631
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:03,424
A real sense of affirmation

632
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:09,312
Yeah somebody validated him in a way that he doesn't feel generally validated by like

633
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:11,104
And I would almost say

634
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:12,896
Maybe it was a financier

635
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:18,528
Maybe he was down in Florida trying to get the money to stay afloat

636
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:19,296
That could be

637
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:23,904
Someone agreed to go through a couple bucks at Infowars

638
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:27,744
Mike went out

639
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,096
He might not have any money in a little bit

640
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:34,912
Could be the guy who runs a grocery store

641
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:42,336
I don't know it's very weird all I hear is like whenever you whenever Alex talks about these like this idea look at weight is lifted from him

642
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:44,896
It's just like someone patted you on the head

643
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,200
You feel really good about it

644
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:49,504
I am glad you had a great trip but you

645
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,528
You still alive mean everything

646
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:54,368
Still sucks is down right now is because he

647
00:31:54,624 --> 00:32:00,768
You coming off the highwomen like I'm so great and now he's in a bad mood so we're helping you out gradient

648
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:03,840
I'm not your fault

649
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:09,728
Finally stopped talking about his own dumbass and starts

650
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,008
Talking about some

651
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:12,800
Some issues

652
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,848
About climate change

653
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:16,896
And I found this

654
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:18,176
Fascinating

655
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:19,456
Freeman

656
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:20,480
Of of

657
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:22,016
Two different idea okay

658
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:24,832
And I'm sure you've all heard me the regular Lister probably

659
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:26,112
5000 * 2

660
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,672
When they collapse of third world of the lock

661
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,024
You're going to say that that

662
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:33,792
Weis

663
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:35,840
Because of climate change

664
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:40,448
Sure as hell Nancy Pelosi cannot set it

665
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,240
Mike said they're also going to say that

666
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:44,544
The new viruses are rising

667
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,104
Because of climate change and that's why they're

668
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:51,456
It was criticized Robertson

669
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:59,392
Say hello humans are bad

670
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:02,208
There's a snowstorm

671
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,072
Gerbil

672
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:08,608
So a couple quick

673
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:14,752
Long before covid was known to anyone they were many people discussing the dynamic that went climates change

674
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:17,312
It makes some regions uninhabitable released

675
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:19,616
Weather by the risk of rising

676
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:20,384
Sea levels

677
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:23,200
Supplier some other variable shifting

678
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:24,224
This weed

679
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,040
Inevitably to some degree of displacement of people

680
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,320
The extent of witches

681
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:29,088
Is going to live to be

682
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:36,256
Second when people discuss climate change cause new diseases they're talkin about her changing climate displaces animals as well

683
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:38,304
And as that happens

684
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,120
Animals who previously would not have been in contact with humans

685
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:42,400
End up contacting human

686
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:43,424
Adding those cases

687
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,496
There's a possibility for transmission of Novel diseases

688
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:48,288
There's also the matter of rising

689
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:50,592
See temperatures making water more hospitable for

690
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:52,128
Things like flesh eating bacteria

691
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:53,664
But all the discussions around

692
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,456
Cause-and-effect

693
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,320
Not every new interaction between an animal and human is going to result in a new disease but

694
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:03,648
Does happen the more possibilities there are four new disease

695
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:04,416
Papa Doc

696
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:11,328
This is something that I guess Alex is complaining with Pat Robertson saying that natural disasters are God's punishment for the USA

697
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:12,096
Accepting LGB

698
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:14,144
EQ Focus humans

699
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:16,192
In 2015

700
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:22,592
Pat Robertson said that a drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average was God punishing the Obama Administration for supporting

701
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:23,872
Access to reproductive health

702
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:25,152
Oh yeah but that one

703
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:28,992
Actually was true

704
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:30,784
There's an important difference

705
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,064
Prince between these two things

706
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,624
The Alex's embarrassingly not understanding

707
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:36,928
And that is what is moralistic

708
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:38,208
And the other is descript

709
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:40,512
The conversation about climate change

710
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:42,816
Can be something that you can discuss

711
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:44,096
With moral implication

712
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:48,704
But it can also be a conversation that you have strictly as a matter of X will cause why

713
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,984
And it still makes a

714
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:53,824
Robertson claims are things that only work as a moral argument

715
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,360
Add almond flimsy one

716
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:58,688
I can't possibly be taken seriously in any other

717
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:03,040
There's no way to coherently explain how Planned Parenthood existing

718
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:04,064
Causes hurricane

719
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:08,160
Except if you embrace the worldview that we're living at the whim of a venture

720
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:11,232
For God who decided that reproductive Healthcare is immoral

721
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:13,280
Morality is a hurricane

722
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:15,584
That's the only way that Robertson

723
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,400
You would make sense for my grammar standpoint

724
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:22,240
The same is not true for the conversations that people have about the side effects

725
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,008
Climate change

726
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:26,080
It's really amazing to see this kind of equivalents being made

727
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:27,616
And realize that there's actually

728
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:30,432
I would probably how I Oz brain works

729
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,504
These two things probably do feel about the same to him

730
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,040
He just thinks that Robertson

731
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:36,832
Claims are closer to reality

732
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:37,856
I get it

733
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:38,880
It's staggering

734
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:40,928
Yeah it's weird to exist

735
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:46,048
We talked about this before but we exist in multiple different

736
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:47,072
Time.

737
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:48,096
Simultaneous

738
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:51,168
Play like it's weird to understand

739
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:56,288
The main factors of climate change and how they swirl around in a global sense

740
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:57,312
Which is

741
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:58,336
Incredible

742
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:01,664
In such a short. Of time to like relative

743
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,432
Simply speaking

744
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:05,248
We've gone from believing that

745
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:07,552
Which has caused all of our problems

746
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:13,696
The understanding what those problems come from on a scientific Andrea level at the same time

747
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:16,256
People still believe that which has caused our problems

748
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:21,632
Crowley in witches how can you do that

749
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:27,008
Yeah it's it's it's interesting to me and sort of hinge point of it is

750
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:29,824
Alex seems to think that the conversations about the

751
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,640
Potential new diseases that we will come in contact with

752
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:33,664
Animals

753
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,688
Get this place is climate

754
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:36,480
Let's change that it's something

755
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:39,296
It is intrinsically about humans being bad

756
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:41,344
And that's not at all

757
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:46,720
A beautiful conversation

758
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:50,560
It's a straw man in order for him to make this somehow when equivalent

759
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:51,584
Call Pat Roberts

760
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,120
Something gay people cause

761
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:53,888
Great

762
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:56,960
So dumb yeah

763
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:57,728
Yeah

764
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,568
It's real difficult to to swing with

765
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:04,384
Bulshit man

766
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,224
We got is I think it's a good indication

767
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:10,272
Example of

768
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:11,296
They have a lot of

769
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:12,576
The stuff that Alex does

770
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:13,600
It's kind of a trap

771
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:15,904
By the way Fentanyl

772
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,208
In the last two months just as Biden got in

773
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,536
DEA says he's up 360

774
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,632
Sprinter 62% I saw the article

775
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:26,400
This weekend

776
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:29,472
360 plus percent

777
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:36,640
Is killing hundreds of thousands of people Autumn black but I know you're not going to see

778
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:39,968
The Emmys are the Grammys really shows pushing this

779
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:48,160
Central importation in the US

780
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:49,184
Lowe's

781
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:55,840
Infowars quotes acting Customs and Border Protection commissioner Troy Miller is saying the following during a media call on March

782
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:58,656
Quote we're seeing a dramatic

783
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:00,960
Increase in fentanyl seizures this fiscal year

784
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:01,984
More than 300

785
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,288
60% higher than this time last year

786
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,824
Now here's a fun game

787
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:09,408
And this is why this information is almost impossible to get rid of ever

788
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:16,064
Alex could use that to argue that there's so much more fentanyl coming into the country then when Trump was President because biting this thing

789
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,088
Signal to the cartels

790
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:18,368
Then it's open season

791
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,696
Of course this doesn't really explain why the police are season all of the bouquet

792
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:26,048
Now imagine that Miller the acting Customs and Border Protection

793
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,072
Commissioner

794
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:28,352
What if you'd reported the

795
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:29,632
Seizures were weighed down

796
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:30,400
From last year

797
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:33,472
What do you imagine Alex's narrative would be at the

798
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:36,288
I believe it would be that

799
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,128
There you are hiding the number of seizures that are occurring

800
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:42,176
Were there just letting it all through yeah

801
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:46,272
Message has gone out just let him on through with the Fentanyl

802
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:47,040
Yeah yeah

803
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:48,064
It's a trap

804
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,088
It doesn't matter

805
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:49,856
And also

806
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:50,624
I do

807
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,392
Care

808
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:52,928
Anyone from customs

809
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:53,696
Border

810
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:57,280
If you can't trust

811
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:00,096
That's a side issue

812
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,424
It's somewhat reliant on

813
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,448
Stasher

814
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:06,240
The actual facts or information

815
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:07,264
In the come out

816
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,032
Matter

817
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:08,800
In cases like that

818
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:10,848
The argument is that trumps approach

819
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:12,128
To the board was good and biting

820
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:13,664
This bad so no matter what

821
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,968
Details get provided they get filtered through that lens

822
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:18,016
The predetermined argument is made

823
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,064
That's all that's going on

824
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:23,136
A b advisor admitting the trumps policies work

825
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:26,208
Alex is reading an Infowars headline that fails to capture

826
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:27,232
Show the real story

827
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:30,560
This was about the southern border and coordinator Roberta Jake

828
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:33,376
Discussing how there may be a relationship between the ending

829
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:35,168
The prompts inhumane policies

830
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:36,960
And a spike in people heading towards

831
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:37,728
The Border

832
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:44,128
There was a hope for a more Humane policy after 4 years of pent-up demand so I don't know if I would call that a coincidence

833
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:49,248
But the idea that a more Humane policy would be in place may have driven people to make that

834
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:54,112
Decision the perhaps more importantly it definitely drove Smugglers to express disinformation

835
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:55,648
Spread disinformation

836
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:56,928
How about what was now pause

837
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:59,744
This isn't. What Alex's reporting because

838
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:02,304
Little bit deeper than the surface appearance level

839
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,328
We can't really handle that

840
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:08,960
Kind of material so it's entirely possible that people were like oh the president does

841
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:12,800
An actively want to murder us soon maybe now would be a better time that it was

842
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:18,688
People who are taking advantage of that perhaps

843
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:25,344
Selling selling people a bill of goods about getting them over the Border

844
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:29,184
Talking about trying to balance mess

845
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,488
Messaging responsibly with policy

846
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:32,256
Yeah it's

847
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:33,024
It's

848
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:35,584
It's just a little bit more complicated than Alex want

849
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:38,400
So

850
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:39,936
How is disease

851
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:41,216
You know

852
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:44,032
Euless guy who's like above The Fray

853
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:45,312
Sure

854
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:49,408
Left-right paradigm

855
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:50,176
But

856
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:56,064
As long as we don't give up they're going to run out of time they're going to fall apart

857
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:03,232
You're run from Democrats you run from socialist

858
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:05,280
You run from leftist you run from liberal

859
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:06,304
Monsters

860
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:07,840
Criminal syndicate

861
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:09,888
And most people to start the left

862
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,168
Being used

863
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:12,960
And destroyed themselves

864
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:16,800
That's all coming up

865
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:31,392
May I could have sworn he was above the left-right Divide I thought that was just a way that they the man got me with a fight with

866
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:37,792
Each other out of the groups that Alex is talking about you need to run from cuz they're monsters are right-wing at all

867
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:39,072
We're

868
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:40,864
This is really important to understand

869
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:46,752
Alex is branding in his earlier career really relied on him pretending to not be extremely right wing

870
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:51,360
He was making arguments over straight out of the John Birch Society of putting forward ideas that were

871
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:52,384
Far to the right of the

872
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,663
The GOP in the 90s

873
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:55,199
So in order to mask that in

874
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:56,479
Expand his potential

875
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:58,527
Beyond the weirdo militia people

876
00:41:59,039 --> 00:41:59,551
You have a lot

877
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:05,183
The essential live his career that he's above the party system and ready to post Democrats and Republicans equally

878
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:06,975
He's not and he's never been

879
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:08,255
He likes extremists

880
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:09,791
And only the Republicans or

881
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:15,423
When liberal-leaning people got tricked into thinking that he was just an iconoclast truth-telling kind of guy

882
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:22,079
What they were actually being tricked into his supporting his right-wing extremist ideology they thought they were being sold

883
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:23,359
Is just an alliance against

884
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:24,383
The man

885
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:27,967
This was done because on its face Alex's it is weak and dumb

886
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:33,599
And people would see right through it and rejected if it was delivered in any way other than in a trojan horse

887
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:36,415
That's what I think about the Pentagon at the end there

888
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:37,695
Alex's just covering something

889
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:39,487
Tucker Carlson is whining about

890
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:42,303
On his show last week on Tuesday

891
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:45,119
The military's too feminine

892
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:46,399
Panda

893
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:52,799
Considering the needs of soldiers who may not be mail his quote a mockery of the US Military

894
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:58,687
I don't know whatever that guy is should just be like

895
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:02,527
Just that guy let's not even worry about free speech

896
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:08,927
Implications or anything let's just be like no no those guys whatever that is if you do exactly that

897
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:09,695
What is illegal

898
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:12,767
What just doesn't seem like a sincere position

899
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:15,071
It's not even a position

900
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:18,399
Rockwell that's fair enough

901
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:22,751
So naturally a lot of folks in the services were offended by these comments and spoke out about it

902
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:26,847
Speaking to reporters Pentagon spokesman John Kirby Express revulsion

903
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:27,871
Tucker's comments

904
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:29,663
And as reported by CNN quote

905
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:34,527
Said the military still had a lot of work to do to become more inclusive more respectful of everyone

906
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:35,551
Especially women

907
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:39,647
We pledge to do better and we will what we absolutely won't do

908
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:43,231
It's a Personnel advice from a talk show host or the Chinese military

909
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:45,023
Maybe those folks feel like they have something

910
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:46,303
Approve that's on them

911
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:50,399
Tucker went on his show and whined about how the Pentagon was attacking him and

912
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:51,423
It's an outrage

913
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:53,471
Now Alex is reporting on toddlers whining

914
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:56,287
This is a game for people like Alex and Tucker

915
00:43:56,799 --> 00:44:02,431
They see something that they know is offensive into meetings and people responded what they said was offensive into meaning

916
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:04,479
MMA pretend that their victims of being a

917
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:06,783
Depressed by people expressing their what they said suck

918
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:07,551
Yeah everybody

919
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:11,647
Get the good news nucycle out of it and then we all move on the next step because

920
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:12,671
Cuz we're all stupid

921
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:15,487
It's outrageously Domina waste of everyone's time and energy

922
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:18,559
And that is the best argument I think for making

923
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:24,959
Tucker Carlson not street legal

924
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:26,751
I'd like in the literal sense

925
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:28,031
It should just be

926
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:30,335
Like you can it's against the law

927
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:31,615
Tubi

928
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:33,407
Carlson on air

929
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:34,431
And if somebody

930
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:37,247
Does that then you just play clips of Tucker Carlson

931
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:38,015
Something that

932
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:38,783
Atkore

933
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:39,807
And then you can pay

934
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:43,647
It's not hard

935
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:45,439
So are you a linguist

936
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:49,279
I like to ask random question sometimes

937
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:55,423
I want to know what you think about this Alex Alex

938
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:56,959
Oh I don't

939
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:59,519
He has the right to make up words

940
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:02,591
I hope he does he's not Mickey

941
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:03,615
He's an innovator

942
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:10,527
We just found something very very interesting

943
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:12,575
I have remembered a few months ago

944
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:18,207
I'm so I'm so glad that they didn't want it falls

945
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:19,743
Cracks in one of the crew members

946
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:22,047
Saw this a notice of themselves

947
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:23,839
Reprogramming

948
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:25,887
I'm wearing masks in Hollywood movies

949
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:27,679
Set up a future as a dish

950
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:28,447
Topia

951
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:31,775
I called him just topics or dystopia

952
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:36,127
That's awesome talk show

953
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:38,175
I can find me a few weeks ago out of town

954
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:46,367
That's another word

955
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:47,903
You can

956
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:50,463
So you can put on them

957
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:51,487
Disco

958
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:55,071
With people that want

959
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:56,095
Dystopia

960
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:57,887
The form of governance on

961
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:00,703
Communist

962
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:02,239
I called them

963
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:06,079
And just as I started using the

964
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:06,847
I think it's been picked up

965
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:07,871
Okay that's fine

966
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:09,919
It's not worth it Alex Invented

967
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:12,223
No I was going to say that's a adjectives

968
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:15,551
Your version of the exact same word as dystopian

969
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:16,831
Both are adjectives

970
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:18,367
Take a note something being similar to

971
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:19,391
Dystopia

972
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:25,279
You can find some really interesting debate among amateur linguist on message boards about whether or not you should ever use this Toby

973
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:26,559
Pickett said of dystopian

974
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:29,375
And the general consensus is that there is no really good reason

975
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:30,655
M2

976
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:32,703
Alex Tanaka

977
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:33,727
Password

978
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:37,055
The earliest appearance of the word in Google's Archive of printed work appears

979
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:38,591
To be a 1905

980
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:41,919
But interesting lead the frequency of those jumps

981
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:42,687
After the night

982
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:43,455
1860s

983
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:46,527
I found an interesting article on the website daily rating

984
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:47,807
Apps that offer is April

985
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:49,343
Control theory for why Alex

986
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:52,415
Has this is like his preferred word or words it's in his head

987
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:56,255
The author of this site was discussing how they use the word dystopic

988
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:58,303
I wondered if it was actually a word

989
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:03,423
I think my use of it in an article may stem from frequent reading of film criticism

990
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:04,703
They then go on

991
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:08,031
Want to give some examples of instances where the word is used generally

992
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:09,055
In the discussion of

993
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:11,359
Pop culture science fiction

994
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:15,711
I suspect Alex is so entrenched in and so influenced by pop culture science

995
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:17,247
I'm thinking that it's a real

996
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:18,783
He's probably encounter the word

997
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:20,063
Just hoping that context

998
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:21,087
Wait a bit

999
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:22,367
And now I guess who just thinks

1000
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:23,135
Going to term

1001
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:25,951
Whether my theory is right or not this is Justin

1002
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:28,767
Embarrassing time-wasting that Alex engaging in here

1003
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:30,047
You know I actually didn't

1004
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:31,583
The right

1005
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:34,143
Have you ever heard the word

1006
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:41,567
It is a real way to remove blood from

1007
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:44,383
I created the word

1008
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:45,151
Explanatory

1009
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:48,735
Which is when you're watching like

1010
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:49,759
Samurai movie

1011
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:54,367
They get excited when they did but it goes all over the splatter it version

1012
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:56,415
That's a good word

1013
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:04,351
It could

1014
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:07,935
Really thinking about

1015
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:09,471
Like did we make fun of Alex

1016
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:12,287
For saying that like we misusing to toe.

1017
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:13,055
I was trying to say

1018
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:14,847
Who cares

1019
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:19,967
I think so are you else other than us would be paying attention and I've used dystopic

1020
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:23,807
Yeah I would imagine

1021
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:25,343
It's come out of our mouths

1022
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:31,743
Prefer to dystopian I think people proper like more accepted version but

1023
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:32,767
It's not that just hoping

1024
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:33,535
Isn't

1025
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:37,887
A word that you can use dystopian very elitist

1026
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:40,447
I don't like it

1027
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:43,263
That's the way I roll buddy you and Alex

1028
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:44,031
Going to hang out

1029
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:46,079
And a hot tub and talk about it sounds good

1030
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:47,871
So grouchy

1031
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:49,151
Avatar

1032
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:50,687
Disturbed

1033
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:54,783
The Trump voters don't want the vaccine

1034
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:58,111
Fauci says it's so disturbing the Trump voters

1035
00:48:58,367 --> 00:48:59,391
Skeptical

1036
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:01,951
An experimental mRNA vaccine

1037
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:05,279
Why would you be skeptical let me just reading somebody's headlines again

1038
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:11,935
Let me just read you some of the things I lie about

1039
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:20,127
Suspense AstraZeneca mRNA vaccine

1040
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:22,431
And people being paralyzed and having Strokes

1041
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:27,807
I think it's okay to be skeptical about a vaccine that was developed as

1042
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:29,087
Quickly as these ones were

1043
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:30,367
That's fine

1044
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:34,207
When you find yourself feeling skeptical the appropriate things

1045
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:38,047
To do is to look into the source of your skepticism and see if you can resolve that

1046
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:39,071
Skepticism

1047
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:40,095
Chronixx

1048
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:41,119
Skepticism

1049
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:42,143
Really healthy

1050
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:45,727
And whenever possible you should transfer your skepticism in the direction

1051
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,263
A finding a concrete position

1052
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:48,031
If you can

1053
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:50,335
This is kind of what I killed

1054
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:53,407
Socrates are just sick of that guy being annoying

1055
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:55,967
The kind of sleight-of-hand that Alex likes

1056
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:56,735
To use a lot

1057
00:49:56,991 --> 00:50:01,855
When he's actually advancing a pointlessly and aggressively anti-vax position he hides behind the illusion

1058
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:02,879
Just being scrapped

1059
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:05,183
Bad to be skeptical

1060
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:08,255
What are you pushing narratives to his audience by various

1061
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:10,559
Victims of gun violence are actors in the hole

1062
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:13,119
Events were staged as an excuse to take his gun

1063
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:14,911
He's actually telling his audio

1064
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:16,703
Cold on it

1065
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:18,495
He hides behind the illusion

1066
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:20,543
Questions that examining things from Alside

1067
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:22,335
What's wrong with asking questions

1068
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:25,151
Alex does this because on some level

1069
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:27,455
He knows that is bulshit doesn't stand up to adults

1070
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:32,575
Scrutiny so the only way for it to fly at all is for him to preemptively give up on his own narrative

1071
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:33,599
As opposed to be forced

1072
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:34,367
Defend them

1073
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:36,159
It's easy to criticize him

1074
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:37,183
But it's

1075
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:39,743
Very hard to criticize being skeptical or asking Quest

1076
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:40,767
Topic

1077
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:42,559
Dwight plays the game that you.

1078
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:45,887
Alex is lying about Marvin Hagler and he doesn't even have a

1079
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:48,191
Conspiracy timeline of Hank Aaron's death rate

1080
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:50,495
Now I see that other issue in Germany

1081
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:55,103
They are just a temporarily halting the rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine quote

1082
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:57,151
Over a small number of blood clot

1083
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:57,919
Concerns

1084
00:50:58,687 --> 00:51:03,807
There were people in Germany who ended up with blood clots but there were a couple cases reported in Denmark and Norway

1085
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:05,087
To Germany decided to halt

1086
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:06,111
Precaution

1087
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:07,135
There has been

1088
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:09,439
37 reported cases of blood clotting

1089
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:14,047
The population of over 17 million people in the world who received the AstraZeneca vaccine

1090
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:16,863
According to the company quote there is no evidence the vaccine

1091
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:18,143
Gary's an increase risk

1092
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:18,911
Klotz

1093
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:23,775
It's entirely possible that number of people out of 17 million would have gotten them anyway

1094
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:24,543
Yeah

1095
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:26,847
Italy halted to use the vaccine as well quote

1096
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:32,223
As a precaution and temporarily after there was concerns that one man in the country died after getting

1097
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:32,991
The shot but

1098
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:34,527
Clear that the death is related

1099
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:35,295
The vaccine

1100
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:37,855
This is a dishonest countries being hyper

1101
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:40,159
Precautious about the vaccine rollout in it isn't it

1102
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:43,231
Any evidence that it's killing anyone or everyone or the back

1103
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:43,999
Dangerous

1104
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:46,303
When I brought up Alex's fake

1105
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:47,839
Titanfall skepticism

1106
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:48,607
It's

1107
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:51,167
To realize that these are the first three stories

1108
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:52,447
He said he comes up with two.

1109
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:55,007
Justify that skepticism about the vaccine

1110
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:56,287
This is bad work

1111
00:51:56,543 --> 00:51:58,591
Answer level of s*** that he's bringing to the table

1112
00:51:59,103 --> 00:52:02,175
He'll be wise for everyone to recognize that Alex has not

1113
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:04,991
Succeeded in justifying his skeptical position

1114
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:08,575
His opposition to the vaccine doesn't rest on facts and reality

1115
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:09,343
It exists

1116
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:10,111
In spite

1117
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:11,647
Yeah I was

1118
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:14,207
Thinking about it is you know like

1119
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:15,743
This vaccine was

1120
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:17,023
Develop so fast

1121
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:19,071
Part of the reason that we are

1122
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:19,839
Article about it

1123
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:20,607
Is because

1124
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:21,631
Almost

1125
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:22,655
Utopia

1126
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:24,191
You know it's almost like

1127
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:25,727
How how

1128
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:28,799
Remarkable

1129
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:32,383
That far but how quickly we didn't suggest like

1130
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:33,151
How quickly

1131
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:34,431
Can we do it

1132
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:40,831
Is there a situation has a lot of potential is there a situation in a few years where we can manufacture vac

1133
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:41,855
Seems almost

1134
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:43,391
Instantly you know like

1135
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:45,695
That's the type of s*** that is almost

1136
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:47,487
Too-good-to-be-true

1137
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:51,327
I told the skepticism there is comes from a place of

1138
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:52,095
Yeah Wonder

1139
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:53,887
I don't

1140
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:55,423
Think I don't

1141
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:56,447
Think that beating

1142
00:52:56,703 --> 00:52:57,471
Taking a bath

1143
00:52:57,983 --> 00:52:58,495
Bye

1144
00:52:58,751 --> 00:52:59,519
Circumstance

1145
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:00,287
Pictures of the world

1146
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:03,359
Particularly you know the life series been so

1147
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:08,479
Insane and adjustments are so complicated and difficult they do to people that had to make

1148
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:09,759
But I think that

1149
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:11,039
You can't have reaction

1150
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:14,111
Is that is in some ways skeptical whether it's

1151
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:16,415
Worry anxiety Bass

1152
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:20,767
He's all based whatever but you do have resources that you can go

1153
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:23,071
To explore that skepticism in resolve

1154
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:27,935
And if you behave like Alex does Synthroid stupid headlines that mean nothing

1155
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:30,751
I do take into context the actual circumstances

1156
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:32,031
Then what you're going to do is

1157
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:34,591
You're going to end up staying in that skeptical place

1158
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:37,663
Or retreating into a dumb position

1159
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:39,711
That was where Alex wanted you to begin with

1160
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:41,503
It's not it's not healthy

1161
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:44,063
It's also a little hard to believe that

1162
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:46,111
We can manufacture vaccine soak

1163
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:46,879
Quickly

1164
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:48,671
At the same time as

1165
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:55,071
Half of Republican men believe in witches causing our problem right so that's a little bit weird

1166
00:53:55,327 --> 00:53:59,167
It's hard to believe but that's because we have human breast

1167
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:02,495
And we can't believe it also

1168
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:03,263
Because we have

1169
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:07,871
So Alex referenced earlier

1170
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:09,151
The program Ensure

1171
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:10,943
You talk about Oblivion again

1172
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:14,783
No talk about that one where Will Smith fights Orcs or something

1173
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:22,207
You're the one the one where it like it's the last guy on earth I Am Legend

1174
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:23,231
Works in a different one now

1175
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:24,511
That's technically vampire

1176
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:26,303
Is it

1177
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:29,375
Are they actually coming from the original the bad guy

1178
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:32,191
What's the review

1179
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:36,543
The evil about

1180
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:44,991
After Earth was at the other one reason space I don't know I think I'm only going to watch movies that either Vince

1181
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:48,319
Price was in or a remix of Wild Wild West

1182
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:52,159
Will Smith movies

1183
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:54,719
That's true here come

1184
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:55,487
The Men in Black

1185
00:54:55,743 --> 00:54:57,535
Galaxy Defender absolutely

1186
00:54:57,791 --> 00:54:59,583
No it's not

1187
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:04,191
First one

1188
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:04,959
Play a clip

1189
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:07,775
Addictive

1190
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:11,615
Is it from Pocahontas

1191
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:12,895
James Cameron film

1192
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:14,943
How much are Oso it is

1193
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:16,223
Chose

1194
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:18,527
The planet Earth in a hundred years or so

1195
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:23,647
And where the atmosphere is so toxic we've all got to wear these face mask

1196
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:24,927
You go back

1197
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:28,511
Can you see the film Blade Runner

1198
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:30,303
Same motif

1199
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:32,351
Dark-sky

1200
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:33,887
Always raining

1201
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:36,447
Flooded city dystopia

1202
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:39,519
17

1203
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:42,591
But that was what was going to happen

1204
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:44,127
Alia Bhatt oceanfront property

1205
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:45,407
20 years ago

1206
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:46,687
Bill Clinton

1207
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:50,527
Obama by the oceanfront property

1208
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:51,295
10 years ago

1209
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:54,367
And of course the fees aren't going up

1210
00:55:54,623 --> 00:55:55,391
It's all lies

1211
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:57,183
They show you a polar bear

1212
00:55:57,439 --> 00:55:59,231
What does cob on Ice Flow

1213
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:01,023
Darling they can't swim

1214
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:04,095
They can swim 300 miles at Hunt

1215
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:06,143
Whale and seal on those

1216
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:08,959
Anybody can go read the Wikipedia entry on them

1217
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:11,263
Wow it is pathetic and on brand

1218
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:13,823
The Wikipedia page on polar bears

1219
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:16,639
Through some kind of dumb point about climate change

1220
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:19,967
The illustration that they classic picture of a polar bear and Cub on a nice

1221
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:20,735
Flow is

1222
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:22,271
I can't swim

1223
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:23,039
Mixtapes

1224
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:26,367
When the ice receives the polar bear loses its ability to hunt

1225
00:56:26,879 --> 00:56:31,743
Polar bears don't just hunt swimming around in the water they had from the edge of ice protruding into water

1226
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:32,511
Where are they

1227
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:33,279
Can catch fish

1228
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:36,351
As ice disappears or becomes less stable they have

1229
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:38,655
Cross longer distances or be left

1230
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:39,935
To try and Fish on the shore

1231
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:40,703
Do they last

1232
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:42,495
Plentiful area

1233
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:44,799
The result of this is that we are likely to

1234
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:47,615
To see collapsing polar bear populations of enough to distance

1235
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:49,151
Future if ice continues

1236
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:52,479
Alex has one image that he thinks we can mock

1237
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:57,855
Better Counterpoint all climate change arguments but in reality it's a strawman he's built so he can win a fake argument

1238
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:04,511
As for people buying oceanfront property I don't know if they did or did not do that but if they did who cares

1239
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:06,559
Not all property near the ocean is in

1240
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:07,327
Intrinsically

1241
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:08,863
High risk due to Rising

1242
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:10,655
Nothing means

1243
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:13,983
Also one big

1244
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:16,799
Problem with Alex's idea but Avatar being pre-programming

1245
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:17,567
To wear masks

1246
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:18,847
Cubans don't

1247
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:24,991
Have to wear masks on Earth in that movie they wear masks on Pandora because I can't breathe the air on that planet

1248
00:57:25,247 --> 00:57:31,391
Happen I don't remember Earth being very important in that movie

1249
00:57:31,647 --> 00:57:33,183
Beginning a little bit on Earth

1250
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:36,255
Some people do wear masks and appears to be like

1251
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:39,327
Because of pollution but not everybody is wearing masks

1252
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:41,631
The only only some people and

1253
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:47,007
In the scenes where they're inside a place everyone doesn't a mastodon has nothing to do really

1254
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:50,591
Fokuslah PS work

1255
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:56,223
Asian cultures have had a mask wearing as more except

1256
00:57:56,479 --> 00:58:00,319
People more acceptable as I totally normal thing

1257
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:02,111
Prolong

1258
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:03,903
Sometime

1259
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:06,463
Probably for Avatar

1260
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:07,487
So f*** off

1261
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:08,767
I don't need this

1262
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:14,143
Yeah but like

1263
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:16,191
You remember of people wearing masks

1264
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:17,727
Then Avatar is on Pandora

1265
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:19,007
Because I can't breathe

1266
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:20,543
Also

1267
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:22,847
Are we going to like

1268
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:29,247
Remote into genetically modified created my other question is like it what is not

1269
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:34,111
Predictive programming about that movie in what

1270
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:35,391
How does that work

1271
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:37,439
Get to join the noble Navi

1272
00:58:37,695 --> 00:58:42,815
Uplifting message

1273
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:43,839
Life entirely

1274
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:46,399
Think

1275
00:58:46,911 --> 00:58:53,055
I think this might be convenient Sprouts we found a scene in the movie where some people had faced

1276
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:57,151
God decided this is predictive programming and decided to ignore the rest

1277
00:58:57,407 --> 00:58:58,943
Talk about blade

1278
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:01,247
So Alex gets to take

1279
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:04,575
Some calls here at the end of this this episode here on the 15th

1280
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:08,671
And this is one color that he takes you talk so for a very long time

1281
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:09,439
And there's some

1282
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:10,719
Very serious problem

1283
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:11,487
Forms of what he's bringing

1284

21 patients live identify

1294
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:38,879
I don't have

1295
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:40,159
Died with a

1296
00:59:40,415 --> 00:59:41,183
In 48 hours

1297
00:59:41,439 --> 00:59:42,463
Getting either the first

1298
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:43,743
As vaccine

1299
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:45,279
AstraZeneca

1300
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:47,327
I'm a geriatrician

1301
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:48,607
They are not calling it

1302
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:51,679
Vaccine-related incident because

1303
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:54,495
CVS is the ones that are out

1304
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:57,823
CVS at the contract

1305
00:59:58,079 --> 00:59:58,847
There's one

1306
00:59:59,103 --> 00:59:59,871
Giant

1307
01:00:00,383 --> 01:00:01,663
Hole in the Sky story

1308
01:00:02,431 --> 01:00:03,967
There's that there's no way that is Paige

1309
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:06,271
Could be dying after getting the AstraZeneca vaccine

1310
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:09,087
Because that vaccine is not approved for use in the United

1311
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:14,975
It's still in Phase 3 clinical trials and do the US has purchased a lot of doses of the vaccine

1312
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:18,815
It's not looking like we're going to be able to get approval to begin using them until spring

1313
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:23,679
It's pretty embarrassing for Alex to not even know what vaccines are approved for use in the United States

1314
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:25,471
But with his alleged doctor to get that

1315
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:26,495
Very critical.

1316
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:27,263
Detail Ron

1317
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:28,543
F****** disqualify

1318
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:33,151
I don't even think I don't think the key is actually a doctor

1319
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:35,967
He starts talking and like

1320
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:38,015
He just gets into like Infowars talking

1321
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:39,039
Complaints about

1322
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:40,575
The dangers of vaccines

1323
01:00:40,831 --> 01:00:41,343
Music

1324
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:43,647
I'm not going to take you seriously

1325
01:00:43,903 --> 01:00:45,439
I mean I don't know I guess I'll see

1326
01:00:45,695 --> 01:00:47,231
Take you as seriously as you're taking

1327
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:51,071
Claim that your patients are on the AstraZeneca vaccine

1328
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:52,863
Because not seriously at all go fuc

1329
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:55,423
Sometimes

1330
01:00:56,959 --> 01:00:57,727
I halfway think

1331
01:00:57,983 --> 01:00:58,751
Some of these guys are

1332
01:00:59,007 --> 01:00:59,519
Roleplay

1333
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:04,383
This is this is what I should say because people need to get

1334
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:05,407
Disinformation

1335
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:08,735
But I'm not actually a geriatrician but it's

1336
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:11,039
The radio on Infowars so f*** it

1337
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:13,599
I'll just say that I'm weigh in on

1338
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:16,159
Medicine in 48 of my patients

1339
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:18,207
You can't take

1340
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:18,975
United States

1341
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:22,559
Exactly so f*** yourself doctor

1342
01:01:24,095 --> 01:01:26,143
Anyway so we get to the 16th

1343
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:28,447
And Alex

1344
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:35,871
Interesting Lee doesn't talk anymore about how he is now the leader of the anointed leader of the Patriots

1345
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:37,663
Don't need to worry about that too much

1346
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:39,967
Storyline drops off

1347
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:41,247
Yeah

1348
01:01:41,503 --> 01:01:43,039
But look man booster going to kill everyone

1349
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:48,159
Ina year 6 years 10 years

1350
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:49,439
Every person is different

1351
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:51,999
And then they'll just playmat it's something else causing it

1352
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:53,279
It's called a soft

1353
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:54,815
Kill weapon

1354
01:01:55,327 --> 01:01:56,863
Silent weapons

1355
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:58,399
For quiet Wars

1356
01:01:58,655 --> 01:02:00,703
Pentagon papers on that if you'd like to go

1357
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:02,751
Look that up but here's the Wall Street Journal

1358
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:04,543
Last year looking forward

1359
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:06,079
To the end of humanity

1360
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:09,151
Humanity will be exterminated

1361
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:10,943
Good loving thing

1362
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:15,807
Silent weapons for quiet Wars is completely fraudulent document those pushed by Bill Cooper and

1363
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:17,087
Book Behold a Pale Horse

1364
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:23,231
We covered it in great detail on episode 381 of our show so if you'd like to hear more about why that's bulshit

1365
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:26,303
And why it's embarrassing for Alex be referencing it as a real

1366
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:27,839
Pentagon document

1367
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:29,375
Hey go ahead give that episode of spin

1368
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:36,287
The article that Alex is referring to the looking forward to the end of humanity that doesn't discuss how great it'll be when Humanity isn't around

1369
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:38,079
It's an easy misrepresent

1370
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:42,175
Patient to make of the headline but the text of the editorial article doesn't say with Alex

1371
01:02:42,431 --> 01:02:43,455
To telling his audience that does

1372
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:48,319
The essential game that Alex plays as to make a really scary claims that attempt

1373
01:02:48,575 --> 01:02:50,111
Defendant by pointed to evidence of that

1374
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:52,159
Pure does support the argument

1375
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:54,463
What is actually misrepresented Oregon

1376
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:55,487
Completely fake

1377
01:02:55,743 --> 01:02:56,255
Thing

1378
01:02:56,511 --> 01:02:58,559
You can sum up most of his career just with that one

1379
01:02:59,071 --> 01:02:59,583
Staff

1380
01:03:00,095 --> 01:03:00,863
Yeah you know

1381
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:04,447
Is it possible for things to be

1382
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:05,215
Great

1383
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:07,007
After

1384
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:10,335
The only people to invent the word great

1385
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:11,615
Argon

1386
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:20,575
I'm not sure what I have I'm not trying to follow you but you if you Manatee has

1387
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:21,343
Gone extinct

1388
01:03:21,855 --> 01:03:24,415
There's no consciousness

1389
01:03:25,183 --> 01:03:28,255
To reflect upon the quality of

1390
01:03:28,511 --> 01:03:29,023
Thanks

1391
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:31,327
What about that thing

1392
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:32,863
Counterpoint

1393
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:34,911
Octopus predict soccer

1394
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:41,055
Oh yeah but I bet the octopus feels in different you know it's not great

1395
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:42,591
Octopuses just like it's really okta

1396

All right right

1398
01:03:50,783 --> 01:03:54,367
I don't know what that octopus would think about this but I do think that Alex

1399
01:03:54,623 --> 01:03:56,159
Might be trying to Launch

1400
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:57,695
A chain email

1401
01:03:57,951 --> 01:03:59,231
I got really can't

1402
01:03:59,487 --> 01:04:01,023
Used listening to Mescalero

1403
01:04:02,815 --> 01:04:03,839
In my chair like

1404
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:06,143
What are you talkin about

1405
01:04:06,399 --> 01:04:07,423
What is there

1406
01:04:08,447 --> 01:04:09,983
Let me read you this first

1407
01:04:10,751 --> 01:04:12,287
Yesterday

1408
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:16,127
And since I didn't cover that submitted you sent it to a bunch of national talk show host

1409
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:24,575
And so

1410

Because it's the truth

1412
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:33,535
Irishman 1776

And we'll get to that

1459
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:35,135
The first just a long and short of this isn't celebrating infertility in the end of people being able to reproduce

1460
01:06:35,647 --> 01:06:39,231
Exacerbated interview with Doctor Who

1461
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:40,255
Is theorizing

1462
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:42,303
That we are running into

1463
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:43,327
Fertility problem

1464
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:44,863
In the next couple decades

1465
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:47,167
Add some chemicals

1466
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:48,447
Send the answer to that I guess

1467
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:49,983
Probably be regulation of

1468
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:54,847
Business industry by-product

1469
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:55,615
Regulate

1470
01:06:56,639 --> 01:06:57,663
Murder

1471
01:06:58,687 --> 01:07:04,831
So the problem with the signing these kinds of things like Alex is doing to Anonymous screen names as I have no idea you Irishman

1472
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:05,599
17 seven

1473
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:06,367
26 is

1474
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:09,695
I don't know if he's the same person who uses that screen name on Reddit

1475
01:07:10,463 --> 01:07:14,815
If you guys that he posted this message two years ago in an oklahoma-based Reddit board

1476
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:18,911
I'm 22 and I'm trying to lose my virginity ladies hit me up

1477
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:21,215
Obviously you need to be 18 or older

1478
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:23,007
Aside from that I don't care about age

1479
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:24,799
I don't care about race or looks

1480
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:26,591
I don't care about your marital status

1481
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:31,711
No idea if that's the same guy or he ended up losing their virginity but you can see the problem here

1482
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:35,039
Silly debaser reporting on Anonymous internet,

1483
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:42,975
Also if this is really funny to see Alex trying to get this comment on his website sent out to people like Tucker Carlson and make it into a jvm

1484
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:44,511
Email your grandparents consent to you

1485
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:46,047
Because the user

1486
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:48,351
The 1776 Irishman

1487
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:49,631
Didn't write it

1488
01:07:50,143 --> 01:07:50,911
If you Google the tech

1489
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:51,679
Text with this post

1490
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:53,471
You will find that Irishman 7

1491
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:56,031
1976 is just reposting a meme

1492
01:07:56,287 --> 01:07:59,871
But I can find being posted on Facebook as early as at least January 30th

1493
01:08:00,895 --> 01:08:02,175
I look around a little more and I found

1494
01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:03,199
Exact text

1495
01:08:03,455 --> 01:08:07,551
The Irishman

1496
01:08:07,807 --> 01:08:09,343
On January 15th

1497
01:08:10,111 --> 01:08:15,487
There's a number of responses to her tweet indicating that this was a message that have been circulating previously on WhatsApp

1498
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:18,047
And Pooja had just copied and pasted it from there

1499
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:24,959
This is an old anti-vax meme that Alex didn't bother to look into and it's pretending is the work of some sagely analysis 21

1500
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:25,983
One of those Anonymous viewers

1501
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:26,751
Conducted

1502
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:30,847
Is outrageously sad whether or not this is the same guy trying to get laid on Reddit

1503
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:33,151
Also the claims in the meme

1504
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:37,759
It better not be David R

1505
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:41,599
I'm disappointed that's that

1506
01:08:42,111 --> 01:08:45,183
Level on showing up at the

1507
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:46,207
The capital dad

1508
01:08:46,463 --> 01:08:49,279
So if you're listening might be Patrick McMahon

1509
01:08:50,815 --> 01:08:55,679
The meme and it's basically just like if I get back to Republic

1510
01:08:55,935 --> 01:08:56,703
Government

1511
01:08:59,007 --> 01:09:00,799
Alex is like yeah you got a

1512
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:01,567
You got a phuc

1513
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:03,615
Can get this out there cuz we're going to win

1514
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:06,687
Take this live segment later

1515
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:07,967
The page

1516
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:10,527
And the Washoe feed

1517
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:12,063
You can share this video

1518
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:12,831
Breakdown

1519
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:15,391

01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:17,439
Infowars.com

1521
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:19,743
Dot-com in the live feed

1522
01:09:19,999 --> 01:09:21,279
Everyone you know

1523
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:27,679
Okay

1524
01:09:27,935 --> 01:09:29,215
On Thursday morning

1525
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:32,543
Free shipping storewide will end

1526
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:34,079
Or perhaps synergistic

1527
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:36,639
Oh God

1528
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:39,455
Separately Irishman 1776

1529
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:45,855
Posted a dumb Meme and my comment section we're going to start a chain email about it send it along

1530
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:47,903
I remember seeing

1531
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:54,047
Wyndham chain email seem to reduce or call if I don't send this to 10 people I will die

1532
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:54,815
You just sleep

1533
01:09:55,071 --> 01:09:57,375
How to resolve an email now

1534
01:09:57,631 --> 01:09:59,167
Yes it has become a chain meme

1535
01:09:59,423 --> 01:10:05,311
Pokemon evolution

1536
01:10:05,823 --> 01:10:06,335
Do something

1537
01:10:06,847 --> 01:10:08,639
He said on the previous episode

1538
01:10:09,407 --> 01:10:09,919
Which is that

1539
01:10:10,431 --> 01:10:12,991
Many people on the left are just useful idiot

1540
01:10:13,247 --> 01:10:15,039
You two are destroying their lives haha

1541
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:16,575
And I feel like

1542
01:10:16,831 --> 01:10:19,135
I'm more looking

1543
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:20,671
To apply that

1544
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:22,719
To Alex himself

1545
01:10:22,975 --> 01:10:28,095
Yeah I think about something you said on the previous episode and that is that all the bigwigs

1546
01:10:28,351 --> 01:10:32,191
Exam the higher-ups in the Auntie globalist world

1547
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:33,727
I can't believe that you

1548
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:39,871
Yuiri communication with Irishman 7070r how do you know so much

1549
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:42,943
Can you imagine how are you right about everything

1550
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:46,783
Read about Irishman 1770

1551
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:51,903
Leaders listen to Alex's show near Dumbo

1552
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:58,559
That's because it what did Putin doesn't have the time to go through Infowars comments

1553
01:10:58,815 --> 01:11:02,655
Alex filter that fit a lot of people

1554
01:11:03,167 --> 01:11:08,287
It's tough to listen to Infowars without our filter shorter and I totally understand that

1555
01:11:08,543 --> 01:11:09,311
I I get it

1556
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:15,967
And I think Alex could extra filter for his own, I don't think I could handle his comments

1557
01:11:16,223 --> 01:11:18,783
That's that would be too toxic

1558
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:22,879
How to do a show where he takes all the Nazi comments

1559
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:28,767
But it wouldn't be much that would be one comment from Irish band 17

1560
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:32,351
Give me a bunch of people that are just being like reposting of memes

1561
01:11:32,863 --> 01:11:35,423
Anyway Alex has found a new operation

1562
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:37,215
That proves

1563
01:11:41,311 --> 01:11:42,847
Joe Biden does what he's told it's

1564
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:44,895
Rockefellers it's the Rothschild

1565
01:11:45,151 --> 01:11:45,919
If the globalist

1566
01:11:46,175 --> 01:11:46,687
Bill Gates

1567
01:11:46,943 --> 01:11:49,759
Works directly under the Rockefeller Brothers Foundation

1568
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:51,039
I thought he was on the couch

1569
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:52,831
What's event 201

1570
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:53,855
Was

1571
01:11:54,111 --> 01:11:55,135
Operation

1572
01:11:56,671 --> 01:11:58,463
Crimson contagion which I will cover

1573
01:11:58,719 --> 01:11:59,231
Tomorrow

1574
01:11:59,743 --> 01:12:01,279
It's just so complex so important

1575
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:09,471
Give me the folder on Crimson contagion or make sure

1576
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:11,775
Forget that tomorrow because that's so critical

1577
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:14,847
One of my favorite things in the world is things that are so important

1578
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:18,687
Prince them but have to resist to getting into them until tomorrow

1579
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:19,967
Seems like he's really thick

1580
01:12:20,223 --> 01:12:20,735
Seriously

1581
01:12:21,247 --> 01:12:23,807
Crimson contagion was a real thing

1582
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:28,671
Here's a series of exercises undertaken by the Trump Department of Health and Human Services

1583
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:30,463
Took place between January and August

1584
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:31,487
2019

1585
01:12:31,999 --> 01:12:34,559
New York Times reported on the exercises last March

1586
01:12:34,815 --> 01:12:36,607
In a conversation

1587
01:12:36,863 --> 01:12:38,655
For Trump and his administration dropped

1588
01:12:38,911 --> 01:12:40,959
The ball in terms of dealing with the novel Coronavirus

1589
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:43,775
There was a report that was completed in

1590
01:12:44,031 --> 01:12:46,847
In October 2019 and reading it is really depressing

1591
01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:47,615
Thing today

1592
01:12:48,127 --> 01:12:50,431
This report based on an exercise testing response

1593
01:12:50,687 --> 01:12:52,223
Let's do a novel influenza outbreak

1594
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:55,295
He's full of lessons we learned after the coronavirus outbreak

1595
01:12:56,063 --> 01:12:56,831
Things like a quote

1596
01:12:57,343 --> 01:12:58,367
Currently there are Inns

1597
01:12:58,623 --> 01:13:03,487
Sufficient funding sources designated for the federal government to use in response to severe influenza pandemic

1598
01:13:03,743 --> 01:13:04,511
Geico quote

1599
01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:08,095
State and federal entities identified challenges in implementing remote work

1600
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:09,375
Telework policies

1601
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:11,935
As a Workforce protection measure quote

1602
01:13:12,447 --> 01:13:17,055
The current medical countermeasures supply chain in production capacity cannot meet the demands imposed

1603
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:18,591
Buy Nations during global

1604
01:13:18,847 --> 01:13:19,615
Influenza pandemic

1605
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:22,943
This is

1606
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:29,343
This is the result of living in both a week and develop a vaccine in six months and a

1607
01:13:29,599 --> 01:13:31,903
We Believe witches are causing our problem Circle

1608
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:35,999
All of our scientists in professional people were like

1609
01:13:36,255 --> 01:13:41,119
Here are the problems will face in a pandemic guess and they were like what if instead he was nothing

1610
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:42,655
What if we get rid of all the witch

1611
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:43,935
Yeah what if you take zinc

1612
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:49,311
So this report also highlighted that exercise participants were confused about which organization

1613
01:13:49,567 --> 01:13:52,639
Find local or federal took the lead in the case of an outbreak which is

1614
01:13:53,919 --> 01:13:59,295
Boy I sure f****** was everybody whenever the federal government decided to kill us

1615
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:06,463
This document is a really huge problem for someone like Alex because it basically demonstrate to the Trump Health and Human Services Department

1616
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:09,279
Was asleep at the wheel when it came to implementing the changes

1617
01:14:09,535 --> 01:14:10,559
Recommended by the sex

1618
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:11,327
Precise

1619
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:14,911
They did this study that revealed things that were clearly a problem then

1620
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:16,191
Trump did nothing

1621
01:14:16,703 --> 01:14:17,727
Public paid for it

1622
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:21,567
Basically at this exercise is a strong indicator that

1623
01:14:21,823 --> 01:14:23,103
Efficient

1624
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:24,895
Effective incompetent government

1625
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:28,479
We could have avoided so much of the pain and misery that's comfort covid-19

1626
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:33,087
This is something that was reported on over a year ago in the mainstream media but I guess Alex

1627
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:34,367
Just heard about it

1628
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:36,159
He's got to come out and do some spin

1629
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:40,767
Because it's so clearly shows the Trump's government had every reason to be aware

1630
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:43,583
Aware some of the difficulties would be in the case of a pandemic

1631
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:46,655
I'll test it make this exercise itself part of the globalist

1632
01:14:46,911 --> 01:14:48,447
Conspiracy in the plot totally

1633
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:53,311
Alex claims to be tomorrow's news today but in reality he's last year's spin being half-assed

1634
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:54,335
Tomorrow

1635
01:14:55,359 --> 01:14:56,383
I'm really proud of that line

1636
01:14:56,639 --> 01:14:59,199
Yeah I know you you delivered it with

1637
01:14:59,455 --> 01:15:00,735
Aplomb then

1638
01:15:00,991 --> 01:15:03,039
I could hit a little bit harder but

1639
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:05,087
We can say we can do to text

1640
01:15:08,415 --> 01:15:10,463
Yeah it's just it's a it's a bummer

1641
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:14,047
I remember when that report was first out

1642
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:14,815
Last year

1643
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:16,351
I remember reading about it

1644
01:15:16,863 --> 01:15:18,655
I don't remember that name

1645
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:19,679
Although quite catchy

1646
01:15:19,935 --> 01:15:21,727
Yeah sure we'll be hearing

1647
01:15:21,983 --> 01:15:24,031
Crimson contagion quite a bit

1648
01:15:25,311 --> 01:15:25,823
From Alex

1649
01:15:27,103 --> 01:15:29,663
Yeah I'd kind of forgotten about some of the findings

1650
01:15:29,919 --> 01:15:30,943
Of it and how

1651
01:15:31,455 --> 01:15:34,527
However like a year ago I think a lot of it would have felt

1652
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:35,295
Different

1653
01:15:35,551 --> 01:15:36,831
Then it does now tell her

1654
01:15:37,087 --> 01:15:40,671
Because I don't think that we would have realized how weary learned all this

1655
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:43,231
I just March 2020

1656
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:44,767
One thing that is

1657
01:15:45,023 --> 01:15:47,071
Is a little bit f****** me up about

1658
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:50,655
How we we deal with this as we do talk a lot about

1659
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:53,983
Rightfully all of the

1660
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:55,007
The people that

1661
01:15:55,263 --> 01:15:56,799
The Trump Administration has

1662
01:15:58,335 --> 01:15:58,847
To death

1663
01:15:59,103 --> 01:16:01,151
All the people that have been

1664
01:16:01,407 --> 01:16:02,431
Crippled by the response

1665
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:04,735
And at the same time

1666
01:16:05,759 --> 01:16:07,039
We don't talk about

1667
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:10,111
It's also their fault that we were trapped inside for a fuk

1668
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:10,879
Second-year

1669
01:16:11,391 --> 01:16:14,463
Hear of everyone's life was taken

1670
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:15,487
Yeah

1671
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:18,047
Around the f****** world

1672
01:16:18,559 --> 01:16:21,119
Because nobody could f****** respond to this like

1673
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:22,143
Goddamn adult

1674
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:23,935
And it's very fresh

1675
01:16:24,447 --> 01:16:25,983
Yeah it's very frustrating

1676
01:16:26,495 --> 01:16:27,007
It is

1677
01:16:27,263 --> 01:16:28,287
Yeah I'm with you

1678
01:16:30,847 --> 01:16:33,663
Anyway because it's such a damning piece of evidence

1679
01:16:34,175 --> 01:16:35,967
The effectiveness of the

1680
01:16:36,223 --> 01:16:36,991
Proper response

1681
01:16:37,247 --> 01:16:38,271
Scott King

1682
01:16:38,783 --> 01:16:39,551
It's part of the

1683
01:16:39,807 --> 01:16:43,135
Revealing their plans

1684
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:44,671
So Alec

1685
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:46,975
Talking about those big new Brzezinski

1686
01:16:50,047 --> 01:16:50,559
I didn't know this

1687
01:16:52,095 --> 01:16:52,607
Carolee

1688
01:16:52,863 --> 01:16:56,191
Zbigniew Brzezinski of the speech one-time-use like kill everyone

1689
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:58,239
That would be an interesting thing for Brazil

1690
01:16:59,263 --> 01:17:02,079
Surprising new one I was surprised to hear that was a new one

1691
01:17:02,335 --> 01:17:04,383
Until there's a rock in the sixties going

1692
01:17:04,639 --> 01:17:05,919
We need to sterilize people

1693
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:09,759
That's actually just talking about like a person

1694
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:10,527
Control

1695
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:13,087
So strong

1696
01:17:13,599 --> 01:17:15,647
Once you remove the sexual organs it's Bass

1697
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:16,927
Just The Kilt

1698
01:17:17,951 --> 01:17:21,279
That's why

1699
01:17:21,535 --> 01:17:22,559
Thirsty afar instead

1700
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:24,351
There's

1701
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:26,143
Easier instead of

1702
01:17:26,655 --> 01:17:28,447
Propagandizing a million people

1703
01:17:31,007 --> 01:17:32,543
We have passed the point

1704
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:34,079
Now this time

1705
01:17:34,591 --> 01:17:35,103
Who killed them

1706
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:38,687
Work

1707
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:44,831
Inoculation

1708
01:17:45,087 --> 01:17:47,391
Know your enemy

1709
01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:49,183
You know I just quoted

1710
01:17:59,423 --> 01:18:01,215
Joyce it would be good

1711
01:18:02,495 --> 01:18:03,519
You will not win this fight

1712
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:06,079
Only killing

1713
01:18:08,639 --> 01:18:12,223
Then we're just going to go okay to go okay

1714
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:15,039
So if I'm to understand

1715
01:18:15,295 --> 01:18:16,575
Amman famous

1716
01:18:16,831 --> 01:18:18,111
4

1717
01:18:19,391 --> 01:18:19,903
Really

1718
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:20,927
Good writing

1719
01:18:21,183 --> 01:18:22,207
Speaking and

1720
01:18:22,463 --> 01:18:22,975
Diplomatic

1721
01:18:23,231 --> 01:18:23,743
Language

1722
01:18:25,023 --> 01:18:25,535
Just went to

1723
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:27,071
To Canada one time was like

1724
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:28,863
Look we got to kill everybody

1725
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:32,959
Second yeah it is a silly

1726
01:18:33,215 --> 01:18:35,007
Although it is fun

1727
01:18:35,519 --> 01:18:41,663
And one of the things I think is most revealing about a clip like that is like know your enemy like no no your fake anime

1728
01:18:41,919 --> 01:18:42,431
This is not real

1729
01:18:42,943 --> 01:18:46,527
I'm not going to go to Bedford zbigniew Brzezinski or any of like

1730
01:18:46,783 --> 01:18:50,367
Any specifics about his foreign policy but I'm looking at this claim

1731
01:18:50,623 --> 01:18:51,391
Alex is making

1732
01:18:52,927 --> 01:18:55,231
The quote is real I'm a part of the quote Israel

1733
01:18:55,743 --> 01:18:57,279
There's a short clip of him again

1734
01:18:57,535 --> 01:18:59,583
Passed around a lot where you guys quote

1735
01:18:59,839 --> 01:19:00,863
In earlier times it was

1736
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:04,959
Easier to control a million people literally was easier to control a million people

1737
01:19:05,215 --> 01:19:06,239
Even physically To Kill A Milli

1738
01:19:06,495 --> 01:19:07,007
People

1739
01:19:07,263 --> 01:19:13,407
Today it's infinitely easier to kill a million people than to control a million people you mean he's describing perhaps

1740
01:19:13,919 --> 01:19:17,247
Humanity's ability to drop a giant bomb on 180

1741
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:22,623
It was hard to find a full transcript of the speech or any concrete citations of what else was said

1742
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:24,415
And I'm certain

1743
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:25,439
From the jump

1744
01:19:25,695 --> 01:19:26,975
Is making all this s*** up

1745
01:19:27,487 --> 01:19:29,791
What percentage of saying here's kind of just

1746
01:19:30,047 --> 01:19:33,631
True like weapons development have been such ever the past hundred years that it's

1747
01:19:33,887 --> 01:19:34,399
Technically easier

1748
01:19:34,655 --> 01:19:36,447
How to kill a million people than it is to control them

1749
01:19:36,703 --> 01:19:38,239
That's descriptively accurate

1750
01:19:38,495 --> 01:19:40,287
I can see no indication from that clip

1751
01:19:40,543 --> 01:19:41,311
Bucket passed around

1752
01:19:41,567 --> 01:19:42,847
But he's saying that it's good to go

1753
01:19:43,103 --> 01:19:44,127
Controller kill people

1754
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:47,967
It's where the disagreement with Alex comes in the drink seem like this has any moral

1755
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:50,527
Indication Tri-Rail

1756
01:19:50,783 --> 01:19:54,623
So this quote comes from a November 17th 2008 speech at the Chatham House

1757
01:19:55,135 --> 01:19:56,927
The rest of the clip that goes around the

1758
01:19:57,183 --> 01:20:01,279
Can find has to do with the fact that there was a political Awakening happening around the world so

1759
01:20:01,535 --> 01:20:07,423
I found it interesting that when I was looking around the next thing I found was a December 16th 2008 op-ed

1760
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:10,495
Represents get published in the New York Times titled quote

1761
01:20:11,007 --> 01:20:12,799
Global political Awakening Shore

1762
01:20:13,567 --> 01:20:15,872
The article is basically making the argument that the US

1763
01:20:16,128 --> 01:20:17,152
Leadership role in the world

1764
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:19,712
Severely tarnished by things like the Iraq War

1765
01:20:19,968 --> 01:20:21,248
And Obama was coming into office

1766
01:20:21,504 --> 01:20:24,064
Very serious need to recover International legitimacy

1767
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:28,928
Seems to happen after a lot of brezza

1768
01:20:30,464 --> 01:20:30,976
Certain

1769
01:20:31,232 --> 01:20:33,280
Turn might snap the compounded things

1770
01:20:33,536 --> 01:20:38,656
Was that two countries like China Japan and India were taking a more prominent role in the global stage

1771
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:40,448
Bruzdzinski had this to say

1772
01:20:41,472 --> 01:20:43,264
In this dynamically changing world

1773
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:45,056
The crisis of American leadership could be

1774
01:20:45,312 --> 01:20:47,104
Become the crisis of global stability

1775
01:20:47,616 --> 01:20:50,688
Yeah in the foreseeable future no state or combination of states

1776
01:20:50,944 --> 01:20:52,992
Can replace the linchpin Rural America plays

1777
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:54,272
In the International System

1778
01:20:54,784 --> 01:20:55,552
Without us

1779
01:20:55,808 --> 01:20:57,600
Recovery there will be no Global recovery

1780
01:20:58,112 --> 01:20:59,136
The only alternative to a

1781
01:20:59,392 --> 01:21:00,672
Constructive American role

1782
01:21:00,928 --> 01:21:01,440
Is global chaos

1783
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:04,000
The New York Times op-ed was in

1784
01:21:04,256 --> 01:21:05,792
Complete text of the speech but

1785
01:21:06,048 --> 01:21:08,864
The full version was published in the January 2009 Edition

1786
01:21:09,376 --> 01:21:10,912
Of the journal International affairs

1787
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:13,728
If you read the quote and its full context

1788
01:21:13,984 --> 01:21:15,264
The actual article

1789
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:16,800
What percent ski is talking about is

1790
01:21:17,056 --> 01:21:18,592
The ending of American colonialism

1791
01:21:18,848 --> 01:21:20,384
Which is the need for which

1792
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:23,200
Is demonstrated by the Iraq War

1793
01:21:23,456 --> 01:21:27,296
Again another one of those lessons that we knew

1794
01:21:27,552 --> 01:21:29,344
Before we did the thing

1795
01:21:29,856 --> 01:21:34,208
These major world powers new and old also face a novel reality

1796
01:21:34,464 --> 01:21:40,608
Wobbly Sawadee of their military might is greater than ever their capacity to impose control over the politically awaken Bass

1797
01:21:40,864 --> 01:21:41,376
Answers of the world

1798
01:21:41,632 --> 01:21:42,656
Is that a historic low

1799
01:21:43,168 --> 01:21:45,472
To put it bluntly in earlier times it was easier to

1800
01:21:45,728 --> 01:21:48,288
Control 1 million people than to physically kill 1 million people

1801
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:51,360
Today it's infinitely easier to kill 1 million people then

1802
01:21:51,616 --> 01:21:52,640
Control 1 million people

1803
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:55,200
Bears directly on the use of

1804
01:21:55,456 --> 01:21:58,528
Woodforest particularly by societies that are culturally alien

1805
01:21:58,784 --> 01:21:59,552
Even if technical

1806
01:21:59,808 --> 01:22:01,088
Technologically Superior

1807
01:22:01,856 --> 01:22:04,160
As a result in the current post-colonial ERA

1808
01:22:04,416 --> 01:22:06,976
It is too costly to undertake colonial wars

1809
01:22:07,488 --> 01:22:12,352
That is a reality some recent American policymakers failed to assimilate to America's debt

1810
01:22:13,376 --> 01:22:17,216
It's very clear that the context of what he saying has to do

1811
01:22:17,472 --> 01:22:18,240
With the

1812
01:22:18,752 --> 01:22:20,032
The gaps

1813
01:22:21,312 --> 01:22:23,872
Bush bush War policy

1814
01:22:25,152 --> 01:22:29,504
To 2% Seidel Tendencies of far-right in all countries

1815
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:34,112
Pierzynski in that article or in that speech

1816
01:22:34,368 --> 01:22:35,392
The transcript of the article

1817
01:22:35,904 --> 01:22:37,440
I'm sorry

1818
01:22:37,696 --> 01:22:39,232
To pretend that

1819
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:40,000
You saying is

1820
01:22:40,256 --> 01:22:41,536
It used to be easier to

1821
01:22:41,792 --> 01:22:44,608
Control a million people than it was to kill them now it's easier to kill them to eat

1822
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:51,008
Yeah that's outrageous I mean I was just making s*** up

1823
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:55,360
The end know your enemy yeah the fake one that I'm going to sell it

1824
01:22:55,616 --> 01:22:59,968
Cuz if you knew the real one you would be like oh

1825
01:23:00,224 --> 01:23:00,992
No I think I'll

1826
01:23:01,248 --> 01:23:01,760
What's my Pete my aunt

1827
01:23:02,016 --> 01:23:07,904
And also the big new Brzezinski had some ideas that you should take your shoe with it but

1828
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:09,696
Difficult for you to wrestle with

1829
01:23:10,208 --> 01:23:15,584
Some of the interconnected realities that the big new Brzezinski was dealing with Alex's pretending

1830
01:23:16,096 --> 01:23:18,400
Someone might say that if you were above

1831
01:23:18,656 --> 01:23:19,680
The two party system

1832
01:23:21,216 --> 01:23:25,312
Famously opposed to the Iraq War if I remember correctly right

1833
01:23:25,568 --> 01:23:27,360
Alex was opposed to the Iraq War

1834
01:23:27,872 --> 01:23:29,408
Yeah yeah

1835
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:30,432
So

1836
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:31,968
Seems like

1837
01:23:32,224 --> 01:23:36,832
You would be like yeah I'm glad that even people on the left

1838
01:23:37,088 --> 01:23:37,856
Paradigm

1839
01:23:38,368 --> 01:23:39,904
Are like the Iraq war is bad

1840
01:23:40,416 --> 01:23:41,440
If you were above the two

1841
01:23:41,952 --> 01:23:43,744
Party system is not it's all an act

1842
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,816
Yeah and I don't think he's ever actually even read that full

1843
01:23:47,328 --> 01:23:47,840
Why would he

1844
01:23:48,096 --> 01:23:53,984
The memes of the context

1845
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:56,800
And the rest of the context for Alex is a dumb impression

1846
01:23:57,056 --> 01:24:00,640
Also we must kill them it's time to move and Kayla Bieber

1847
01:24:00,896 --> 01:24:05,248
Yep so it's so stupid like and then claiming that the direct quote

1848
01:24:05,504 --> 01:24:06,272
F*** off

1849
01:24:06,528 --> 01:24:07,040
Yeah

1850
01:24:07,296 --> 01:24:08,576
Recite abusive to the audience

1851
01:24:08,832 --> 01:24:11,392
It doesn't give them the ability to

1852
01:24:11,904 --> 01:24:13,440
Actually choose

1853
01:24:13,952 --> 01:24:17,792
Who they liked and disliked in the world when you create completely false portraits

1854
01:24:18,048 --> 01:24:19,072
Love your enemies

1855
01:24:19,328 --> 01:24:21,120
Because you want to scare them and keep them

1856
01:24:21,376 --> 01:24:23,936
Keep them in your in your side

1857
01:24:24,704 --> 01:24:27,776
I don't want these people to have a choice

1858
01:24:28,032 --> 01:24:28,800
Llavero

1859
01:24:29,824 --> 01:24:30,336
So Jordans

1860
01:24:30,592 --> 01:24:31,104
We got a guest

1861
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:37,504
This guy that I haven't heard of before I haven't seen him stew Peters stupid and so I looked him up

1862
01:24:38,016 --> 01:24:41,344
I thought his name was spelled St Peters

1863
01:24:41,856 --> 01:24:42,880
Can't I look that guy up

1864
01:24:43,392 --> 01:24:46,720
Apparently there's like a broadcaster in the UK who got in trouble for

1865
01:24:46,976 --> 01:24:53,120
Beck's making some offensive comments about black lives matter

1866
01:24:54,912 --> 01:24:59,008
I understand correctly now I know it requires

1867
01:24:59,264 --> 01:25:01,568
3 to have a pattern but I am beginning to suspect

1868
01:25:01,824 --> 01:25:03,616
Suspect that all stupid eaters are bad

1869
01:25:05,152 --> 01:25:05,664
I mean

1870
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:06,688
I know of two

1871
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:09,248
Peter's in Oradea

1872
01:25:09,504 --> 01:25:10,784
But these two are not

1873
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:14,880
They're not helping your team if there are I need to know now you need to

1874
01:25:15,136 --> 01:25:16,672
To break the pattern of 3

1875
01:25:16,928 --> 01:25:21,280
Cuz once we get 2/3 I'm going to then assume all Stu Peters from now on

1876
01:25:21,792 --> 01:25:22,304
Haha people

1877
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:24,096
So stupid as not stupendous

1878
01:25:26,144 --> 01:25:27,936
Shut up

1879
01:25:29,216 --> 01:25:34,336
I like like how I told you to shut up when you said nothing

1880
01:25:36,128 --> 01:25:38,176
Stu Peters is on Anza

1881
01:25:39,712 --> 01:25:43,296
This guy's a s******* put like I found this clip really interesting

1882
01:25:43,552 --> 01:25:44,320
Because he is like

1883
01:25:44,832 --> 01:25:46,880
If he's auditioning for a job with Infowars

1884
01:25:47,136 --> 01:25:47,648
He nailed

1885
01:25:47,904 --> 01:25:49,440
Okay so many buzzwords

1886
01:25:49,696 --> 01:25:52,000
If I ran out of time and I Was preparing this episode

1887
01:25:52,256 --> 01:25:54,048
But I was legit going to make

1888
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:56,352
Go-karts

1889
01:25:56,608 --> 01:25:57,376
I got bingo

1890
01:25:57,632 --> 01:26:03,776
He's hitting them all legitimate Lee said in the middle of this clip when I was listen to episode I got to go

1891
01:26:04,032 --> 01:26:04,544
Did you need to use the

1892
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:07,616
The free space or did you get home now okay

1893
01:26:10,944 --> 01:26:13,760
Due process here is not something

1894
01:26:14,016 --> 01:26:14,528
The new Wok

1895
01:26:14,784 --> 01:26:15,296
America

1896
01:26:16,576 --> 01:26:17,344
Condemnation

1897
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:18,880
Demasculinization

1898
01:26:19,392 --> 01:26:22,464
Immunization the neutering the castration of law enforcement officers

1899
01:26:22,976 --> 01:26:24,000
All over the place

1900
01:26:24,256 --> 01:26:25,280
Is no longer a

1901
01:26:25,792 --> 01:26:26,560
Policing is a

1902
01:26:30,912 --> 01:26:31,936
Leftists

1903
01:26:32,192 --> 01:26:33,728
Communist

1904
01:26:33,984 --> 01:26:34,496
Terry and Faye

1905
01:26:37,056 --> 01:26:38,592
Basically ignores you come from

1906
01:26:38,848 --> 01:26:40,640
Is the new nazi-style brownshirts

1907
01:26:41,152 --> 01:26:47,296
Oh God I got to cross the road

1908
01:26:52,928 --> 01:26:54,720
Written all over him

1909
01:26:54,976 --> 01:26:59,072
And then it turns out that he didn't got to do a little bit of white victimhood I'm like Alice's writing

1910
01:26:59,328 --> 01:27:00,864
The contract right now

1911
01:27:01,632 --> 01:27:06,752
During his other interviews Alex is eating a cheeseburger

1912
01:27:07,008 --> 01:27:11,104
Saying buzzwords

1913
01:27:11,872 --> 01:27:14,176
Okay we are legalizing crime in the United

1914
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:19,552
Baxter's

1915
01:27:21,088 --> 01:27:24,928
Anybody

1916
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:25,952
Go to work

1917
01:27:26,208 --> 01:27:26,720
If you are a y

1918
01:27:30,048 --> 01:27:30,816
You are deaf

1919
01:27:33,376 --> 01:27:34,400
.

1920
01:27:35,936 --> 01:27:36,448
Because there is not

1921
01:27:36,704 --> 01:27:37,216
Anybody

1922
01:27:37,472 --> 01:27:39,264
The higher ranks of law enforcement or the government

1923
01:27:41,056 --> 01:27:43,360
All these institutions that we were raised Alex

1924
01:27:43,872 --> 01:27:44,896
These are the people that we can try

1925
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:46,944
The ones that are coming after you

1926
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:47,968
I don't like whites

1927
01:27:48,224 --> 01:27:54,368
Anymore and everything but now we just

1928
01:27:54,624 --> 01:27:58,720
Yeah I think

1929
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,792
Quickly when I hear someone who's got this

1930
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:06,656
Verbal pattern guy who throws around buzzwords like he does

1931
01:28:07,424 --> 01:28:08,704
This guy a guy who's

1932
01:28:09,216 --> 01:28:13,056
I need the whole reason he's on is to talk about the Floyd trial

1933
01:28:13,312 --> 01:28:14,336
Derek Chauvin

1934
01:28:14,592 --> 01:28:15,104
And trial

1935
01:28:16,128 --> 01:28:16,640
Do you know what this is

1936
01:28:16,896 --> 01:28:21,504
Is that that's what is the neutering of the police shouldn't have your Shake Shack

1937
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:22,784
Benno bring up something like

1938
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:24,320
Straight God-fearing

1939
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:27,648
Conservatives are heading for a gulag of my calf

1940
01:28:27,904 --> 01:28:28,672
I got to go man

1941
01:28:28,928 --> 01:28:30,976
I can't stand

1942
01:28:31,488 --> 01:28:32,256
These people

1943
01:28:33,024 --> 01:28:33,792
Because

1944
01:28:34,048 --> 01:28:36,096
This is the type of s*** where you're like

1945
01:28:36,864 --> 01:28:40,960
1 in a certain sense this is a benchmark of the progress of the conservative right

1946
01:28:41,984 --> 01:28:44,032
Because you could grab that again

1947
01:28:44,288 --> 01:28:44,800
Exact dude

1948
01:28:45,568 --> 01:28:46,080
Put them in the SEC

1949
01:28:46,848 --> 01:28:48,640
I need say the exact same s***

1950
01:28:48,896 --> 01:28:49,408
But it be

1951
01:28:49,664 --> 01:28:50,176
More Explorer

1952
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:52,480
Take them put them in the 30

1953
01:28:52,736 --> 01:28:54,528
He be saying the exact same s***

1954
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:57,344
But even more explicit than the 60

1955
01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:03,744
And then he's a Democrat

1956
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,792
You know that's what this guy is

1957
01:29:06,048 --> 01:29:11,168
I know this guy every. Of American History go away

1958
01:29:11,936 --> 01:29:17,568
Yeah we're leaving you behind I'm not up to speed

1959
01:29:17,824 --> 01:29:18,336
The table

1960
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:22,432
Actually had a really complicated sort of experience

1961
01:29:22,688 --> 01:29:23,456
Trying to figure out like

1962
01:29:23,968 --> 01:29:25,760
This guy's deal

1963
01:29:26,016 --> 01:29:27,296
Used to be a bounty hunter

1964
01:29:27,552 --> 01:29:33,696
And so I was like man you should just ate a bounty hunter like I don't want you to be a bounty hunter

1965
01:29:36,768 --> 01:29:38,304
I don't want you to be a pundit

1966
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:40,608
Nor Bounty Hunter

1967
01:29:42,656 --> 01:29:44,448
Two weeks ago he was about to Hunter

1968
01:29:44,704 --> 01:29:49,056
Great data entry as a medium ground

1969
01:29:49,312 --> 01:29:52,384
Turns out if you listen to this clip careful he doesn't know much about data

1970
01:29:52,896 --> 01:29:54,944
The level of gaslighting has reached

1971
01:29:55,456 --> 01:29:56,992
Mad Hatter levels here

1972
01:29:58,272 --> 01:29:59,296
Well some of those numbers

1973
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:02,368
I don't have

1974
01:30:02,624 --> 01:30:03,136
Exact

1975
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:04,928
Debate numbers

1976
01:30:07,488 --> 01:30:08,768
Chasing fugitives

1977
01:30:09,024 --> 01:30:09,792
Weeks ago

1978
01:30:10,048 --> 01:30:11,072
After 18 years of doing

1979
01:30:12,864 --> 01:30:14,144
You know in writing and

1980
01:30:15,168 --> 01:30:16,960
Sufficient numbers to understand

1981
01:30:17,216 --> 01:30:18,496
What's really going on

1982
01:30:19,008 --> 01:30:20,544
Every single community

1983
01:30:22,848 --> 01:30:24,128
We're doing a

1984
01:30:24,384 --> 01:30:27,968
People taking people to jail

1985
01:30:30,784 --> 01:30:32,064
People of color with blacks

1986
01:30:33,856 --> 01:30:36,672
You know I don't know why that is

1987
01:30:38,976 --> 01:30:39,744
Last year

1988
01:30:40,256 --> 01:30:42,304
Look at the cops and black people

1989
01:30:45,632 --> 01:30:46,144
9

1990
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:48,192
9 unarmed black people

1991
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:49,728
Cops last year

1992
01:30:50,752 --> 01:30:51,520
19

1993
01:30:52,032 --> 01:30:52,800
White unarmed

1994
01:30:53,056 --> 01:30:53,568
People

1995
01:30:57,408 --> 01:30:58,432
Every single year

1996
01:31:00,224 --> 01:31:01,760
Question is what is the blue eyes matter

1997
01:31:02,272 --> 01:31:05,600
So I can sort this out for us to really fast if he's actually interested

1998
01:31:05,856 --> 01:31:08,928
The reason more cops are shot each year than unarmed black people is

1999
01:31:09,184 --> 01:31:09,696
Because they're cops

2000
01:31:09,952 --> 01:31:11,744
And the job comes with the heightened likelihood of

2001
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,024
Encountering criminals with gun

2002
01:31:13,792 --> 01:31:17,888
It's not good the cops are shot but it's also an understandable aspect of that line of work

2003
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:20,448
An element that they don't share with

2004
01:31:20,704 --> 01:31:22,240
People who happen to be black and unarmed

2005
01:31:23,264 --> 01:31:29,152
Ask for the discrepancy between 9 unarmed black people and 19 unarmed white people being killed by cops last year

2006
01:31:29,408 --> 01:31:30,176
This is another one

2007
01:31:30,432 --> 01:31:31,968
Really super easy to sort out

2008
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:38,368
I have no idea if his numbers are even accurate but let's assume for the sake of argument that they are cuz that's what he's bringing to the table

2009
01:31:39,136 --> 01:31:40,672
According to the US Census Data

2010
01:31:40,928 --> 01:31:44,256
In 2019 the most recent numbers that he could find the u.s. population

2011
01:31:44,512 --> 01:31:46,048
60.1% White

2012
01:31:46,304 --> 01:31:47,328
+ 12

2013
01:31:47,584 --> 01:31:48,352
5% black

2014
01:31:48,864 --> 01:31:50,400
Assuming Stu's numbers are correct

2015
01:31:50,656 --> 01:31:53,984
Even though there were more total white people who are shot by cops

2016
01:31:54,496 --> 01:31:55,776
Still wildly

2017
01:31:56,032 --> 01:31:56,800
It wouldn't be in terms of

2018
01:31:57,056 --> 01:31:58,080
The population sizes

2019
01:31:58,848 --> 01:32:00,384
If a country where 50% light in

2020
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:02,688
In 50% black then his numbers might mean something

2021
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:07,040
But the demographics don't look like that it is numbers are nothing more than props

2022
01:32:07,296 --> 01:32:10,112
He's using to mask the underlying racism of his actual argument

2023
01:32:11,392 --> 01:32:13,952
The thrust of this and the main point is that we shouldn't

2024
01:32:14,208 --> 01:32:17,024
Be concerned about police killing unarmed black people

2025
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:18,048
Can I find that offensive

2026
01:32:18,816 --> 01:32:22,144
We should care about police killing people regardless of other variables involved

2027
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:23,936
Even stuzo numbers

2028
01:32:24,192 --> 01:32:26,240
Illustrate there's a much higher likelihood

2029
01:32:26,496 --> 01:32:29,568
Of an unarmed black person being killed by police

2030
01:32:30,592 --> 01:32:31,360
Basically this clip

2031
01:32:31,616 --> 01:32:34,432
The perfect encapsulation but how I feel about Stu Peters

2032
01:32:34,688 --> 01:32:37,760
He's either too stupid to know that the statues using are meaningless

2033
01:32:38,016 --> 01:32:40,832
Understands exactly what he's doing and he's trying to minimize

2034
01:32:41,088 --> 01:32:42,112
Issues related to racing

2035
01:32:42,368 --> 01:32:42,880
Policing

2036
01:32:43,136 --> 01:32:45,184
If he's been sloppy with something like that

2037
01:32:46,464 --> 01:32:49,024
Fury has something to do with his primary field of expertise

2038
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:50,560
Donkey with a bounty hunter

2039
01:32:51,584 --> 01:32:52,352
Floppy there

2040
01:32:52,608 --> 01:32:54,912
I'm not going to listen to him on any topic that he's not

2041
01:32:56,192 --> 01:32:57,216
Conceivably an expert at like

2042
01:32:57,472 --> 01:32:57,984
I want to know what the

2043
01:32:58,240 --> 01:33:00,032
This guy takes about covid-19

2044
01:33:00,288 --> 01:33:01,312
Yeah you know I was

2045
01:33:01,568 --> 01:33:06,176
I've never wondered why it is bounty hunters aren't in charge of things

2046
01:33:06,688 --> 01:33:08,992
But I think there's a good reason

2047
01:33:09,504 --> 01:33:11,296
You don't support the reign of King dog

2048
01:33:11,552 --> 01:33:12,064
Just don't

2049
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:14,624
Bounty hunters should really be in charge of

2050
01:33:15,392 --> 01:33:17,440
That look I love Cowboy Bebop

2051
01:33:17,952 --> 01:33:19,488
I think bounty-hunting on mccreight

2052
01:33:19,744 --> 01:33:21,280
That's great fantastic

2053
01:33:24,096 --> 01:33:27,680
They do run things though I'm aware of

2054
01:33:28,192 --> 01:33:29,984
Since I listen to this interview this guy

2055
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:33,056
Bounty Hunter

2056
01:33:33,312 --> 01:33:34,336
Spike Spiegel

2057
01:33:34,592 --> 01:33:39,200
Jet-black I do a valentine I don't know any of these people radical Edward and

2058
01:33:39,456 --> 01:33:41,504
I'm talking about real life

2059
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:42,272
Oh okay

2060
01:33:42,528 --> 01:33:46,880
Took this dog and this guy both of them have stories

2061
01:33:47,136 --> 01:33:47,648
About

2062
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:49,696
Crossing the border and trying

2063
01:33:49,952 --> 01:33:55,328
To kidnap somebody dog did that and then this guy was telling story

2064
01:33:55,584 --> 01:33:58,144
Show about how you got in trouble for going to Mexico to FedEx

2065
01:33:58,400 --> 01:33:58,912
Easter dates

2066
01:33:59,936 --> 01:34:01,984
Bounty Hunter why do I have

2067
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:05,056
To pay attention to international law

2068
01:34:05,312 --> 01:34:07,104
I am Batman

2069
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:08,384
Wherever I want

2070
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:10,432
Want to solve crime

2071
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:16,576
Most of his interview

2072
01:34:17,088 --> 01:34:19,136
This annoying of a voice

2073
01:34:19,392 --> 01:34:21,440
You disqualify yourself that hard

2074
01:34:21,696 --> 01:34:22,464
On stats

2075
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:24,000
I don't even really care

2076
01:34:24,256 --> 01:34:25,024
And

2077
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:28,096
And literally everything you say is just a giant racist dog whistle

2078
01:34:28,608 --> 01:34:29,376
Yes yeah

2079
01:34:29,632 --> 01:34:30,656
And we have

2080
01:34:30,912 --> 01:34:31,680
A return

2081
01:34:32,192 --> 01:34:32,704
On podcast

2082
01:34:33,472 --> 01:34:34,240
Beaver return

2083
01:34:34,496 --> 01:34:37,824
But somebody we haven't seen a little bit while cat little bit while

2084
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:38,848
We got the health Ranger

2085
01:34:39,104 --> 01:34:39,872
Mike Adams

2086
01:34:40,384 --> 01:34:42,688
He has a story

2087
01:34:42,944 --> 01:34:43,456
About

2088
01:34:43,712 --> 01:34:45,760
A guy who

2089
01:34:46,016 --> 01:34:49,344
Interesting perspective I don't fully understand it myself

2090
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:50,624
And it would be kind of

2091
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:51,648
Silly for me to try to

2092
01:34:51,904 --> 01:34:52,672
Pontificate about it

2093
01:34:53,184 --> 01:34:54,208
But it's easy

2094
01:34:54,464 --> 01:34:56,768
A guy who's trying to make an argument that

2095
01:34:57,024 --> 01:35:00,864
A vaccine works on individual levels

2096
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:02,912
But there may be some negative consequences

2097
01:35:03,424 --> 01:35:06,240
From applying them broadly across the population

2098
01:35:06,496 --> 01:35:07,776
When there's already an outbreak

2099
01:35:08,032 --> 01:35:08,544
Brett Sher

2100
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:11,104
As I understand that they are

2101
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:12,128
Putting forth

2102
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:15,712
Mike Adams takes that and now is a new tip

2103
01:35:15,968 --> 01:35:16,992
OKC Thunder new tip

2104
01:35:17,248 --> 01:35:19,296
Is it under for Humanity

2105
01:35:19,552 --> 01:35:22,368
No it's really really over vanity

2106
01:35:23,648 --> 01:35:24,672
Can we do

2107
01:35:25,184 --> 01:35:28,512
Of course it's which is

2108
01:35:29,024 --> 01:35:30,816
Boost your immune function make sure you have

2109
01:35:31,072 --> 01:35:31,840
Good nutrition

2110
01:35:32,096 --> 01:35:33,376
Get plenty of rest

2111
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:34,912
Void

2112
01:35:35,168 --> 01:35:35,936
Vaccinated people

2113
01:35:36,448 --> 01:35:37,728
Because they are the virus

2114
01:35:39,264 --> 01:35:40,032
They are the mutant

2115
01:35:40,288 --> 01:35:40,800
Factory

2116
01:35:43,104 --> 01:35:45,152
Educate the people around you so that they

2117
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:47,200
Before they run over and tried

2118
01:35:47,456 --> 01:35:48,480
How to get vaccinated

2119
01:35:48,736 --> 01:35:50,528
Yourself

2120
01:35:51,296 --> 01:35:52,320
Person

2121
01:35:52,576 --> 01:35:53,344
You are soccer

2122
01:35:54,624 --> 01:35:55,136
Vaccine

2123
01:35:55,392 --> 01:35:55,904
Suicide

2124
01:35:56,928 --> 01:35:57,440
Wow

2125
01:35:57,696 --> 01:35:58,720
That's that's something

2126
01:35:58,976 --> 01:36:00,256
I mean you could have called it back

2127
01:36:00,512 --> 01:36:01,024
Vaccine

2128
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:01,792
You could

2129
01:36:02,048 --> 01:36:03,072
Yeah I think that's a

2130
01:36:04,352 --> 01:36:05,632
The tongue a lot better

2131
01:36:05,888 --> 01:36:09,216
Fixies are rapper

2132
01:36:09,472 --> 01:36:13,056
Even Alex can invent words that already existed

2133
01:36:13,312 --> 01:36:17,152
This is this is kind of interesting to me because it's like okay this is evolve

2134
01:36:17,408 --> 01:36:20,224
GolfNow and that might avoid anyone who's been

2135
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:26,624
How do you get away with it you said it's over for Humanity now you're gone

2136
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:28,416
The idea that he's trying to put forth

2137
01:36:28,672 --> 01:36:29,440
What is that

2138
01:36:29,696 --> 01:36:32,000
People who get vaccinated will

2139
01:36:32,256 --> 01:36:37,120
End up causing mutations your virus and then they will give you

2140
01:36:37,376 --> 01:36:40,960
They're the incubators for a whole new generation of murder

2141
01:36:41,216 --> 01:36:44,544
You got to avoid turn into like

2142
01:36:45,568 --> 01:36:47,104
I don't know

2143
01:36:47,616 --> 01:36:48,128
I don't know how

2144
01:36:48,384 --> 01:36:50,176
Many people take any of this seriously

2145
01:36:50,432 --> 01:36:50,944
But

2146
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:52,224
Assuming that there are like

2147
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:53,504
You've got to think that this is

2148
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:54,784
This would lead to communist

2149
01:36:55,296 --> 01:36:58,624
Yeah you have to isolate yourself

2150
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:03,232
People

2151
01:37:03,488 --> 01:37:06,560
Like I don't know they're really mad about

2152
01:37:07,328 --> 01:37:10,656
The idea that international travel Comfort countries might require

2153
01:37:10,912 --> 01:37:12,192
Proof of vaccination

2154
01:37:12,448 --> 01:37:18,592
Have to create communities were proof of non vaccination is the only way you can get it seems so and if they have it

2155
01:37:18,848 --> 01:37:19,872
Outbreak in those communities

2156
01:37:23,712 --> 01:37:24,224
Yeah

2157
01:37:27,808 --> 01:37:28,320
I don't this is

2158
01:37:28,576 --> 01:37:29,088
Just dumb

2159
01:37:29,344 --> 01:37:31,648
I don't know anyway these guys have

2160
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:34,208
Bad solutions to imaginary problem

2161
01:37:34,464 --> 01:37:35,232
Wednesday May.

2162
01:37:35,488 --> 01:37:38,048
But I think that the function of this narrative

2163
01:37:38,304 --> 01:37:41,120
In terms of the the larger sphere of Infowars talking

2164
01:37:41,888 --> 01:37:43,936
Is I think that they recognize

2165
01:37:44,192 --> 01:37:45,728
Is that historically

2166
01:37:45,984 --> 01:37:47,008
Will you see an outbreak

2167
01:37:48,544 --> 01:37:50,592
Vaccine-preventable conditions

2168
01:37:50,848 --> 01:37:52,384
And non-vaccinated community

2169
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:54,176
A lot of times anti-vax

2170
01:37:54,688 --> 01:37:55,456
Clusters chair

2171
01:37:55,712 --> 01:37:56,480
End up having

2172
01:37:56,736 --> 01:37:58,016
A resurgence

2173
01:37:58,272 --> 01:37:59,552
Things that are prevented

2174
01:37:59,808 --> 01:38:02,112
Measles became a problem

2175
01:38:02,624 --> 01:38:04,672
I think that they recognize that there is a

2176
01:38:04,928 --> 01:38:05,696
Decent chance

2177
01:38:06,464 --> 01:38:06,976
That

2178
01:38:07,232 --> 01:38:07,744
Should

2179
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:08,512
Covid

2180
01:38:08,768 --> 01:38:09,280
Stop being a

2181
01:38:09,536 --> 01:38:13,120
No problem due to widespread vaccination that they'll end up

2182
01:38:13,888 --> 01:38:14,912
Being blamed

2183
01:38:15,424 --> 01:38:21,568
Because they don't want to get vaccinated until they have to create a new explanation for it and it's vaccinated people

2184
01:38:21,824 --> 01:38:22,336
Have created

2185
01:38:22,592 --> 01:38:23,616
Mutant

2186
01:38:23,872 --> 01:38:25,408
Things within their body

2187
01:38:26,944 --> 01:38:27,712
Guess what happened

2188
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:30,016
10 people are going to come to your house

2189
01:38:30,272 --> 01:38:31,040
Vaccinate

2190
01:38:31,296 --> 01:38:33,856
Gunpoint and not only that I want Daleks

2191
01:38:34,112 --> 01:38:34,624
Today

2192
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:37,184
Race war also

2193
01:38:38,976 --> 01:38:42,560
I got bingo I was still closed. From this

2194
01:38:43,072 --> 01:38:44,352
Could be much could be a year

2195
01:38:44,864 --> 01:38:46,656
Medical doctors and scientists

2196
01:38:46,912 --> 01:38:50,752
They're going to blame us there already are you going to live with us

2197
01:38:51,264 --> 01:38:55,104
It doesn't matter

2198
01:38:57,408 --> 01:38:58,176
The mask

2199
01:38:58,432 --> 01:38:59,200
Second the second one

2200
01:39:00,736 --> 01:39:01,760
And then say that this

2201
01:39:02,272 --> 01:39:02,784
Surprise

2202
01:39:03,808 --> 01:39:04,320
Vaccinations

2203
01:39:05,344 --> 01:39:06,368
Point they will be able to have the

2204
01:39:06,624 --> 01:39:07,392
The political power

2205
01:39:07,648 --> 01:39:09,184
To unleash now the

2206
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:09,952
Military

2207
01:39:10,464 --> 01:39:12,768
Insta will Kateri

2208
01:39:13,024 --> 01:39:14,304
Confiscating your guns

2209
01:39:28,128 --> 01:39:28,640
Go ahead 90

2210
01:39:29,408 --> 01:39:30,176
I got 92nd

2211
01:39:31,712 --> 01:39:36,064
To stop rewarding restore Medical

2212
01:39:36,576 --> 01:39:38,880
Sound bites only know complicated plans

2213
01:39:39,136 --> 01:39:42,976
Definitely not anything with nuance

2214
01:39:43,744 --> 01:39:44,768
Josh it's over for you

2215
01:39:46,048 --> 01:39:51,936
Why the race war got thrown in their accessories a preoccupation of these pigs out there race war in there

2216
01:39:52,448 --> 01:39:52,960
Yammy

2217
01:39:53,216 --> 01:39:55,264
Just feels like a preemptive

2218
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:58,336
Narrative building fourth possibility

2219
01:39:59,616 --> 01:40:00,384
Gated communities

2220
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:04,224
So if I understand correctly so far what we're dealing with

2221
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:08,064
Is Alex Jones as the only person you can trust

2222
01:40:08,832 --> 01:40:14,208
You need to avoid all vaccinated people would probably means you guys need to get together in a communist

2223
01:40:14,464 --> 01:40:17,792
And a race war is obviously coming haha

2224
01:40:18,048 --> 01:40:22,144
So explain to me how different Alex is from Charles

2225
01:40:23,936 --> 01:40:24,448
Speak

2226
01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:29,056
Well Charles Manson never inspired people do storms

2227
01:40:29,312 --> 01:40:29,824
The capital

2228
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:31,360
No that's true there's that

2229
01:40:31,872 --> 01:40:32,384
Yeah

2230
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:33,920
I don't I don't know

2231
01:40:34,176 --> 01:40:36,224
They are both friends with musicians

2232
01:40:36,736 --> 01:40:38,528
Billy corgan's been on Infowars

2233
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:39,552
Totally

2234
01:40:42,624 --> 01:40:43,648
Alex hasn't carb

2235
01:40:43,904 --> 01:40:44,672
Swastika

2236
01:40:44,928 --> 01:40:46,208
That's true

2237
01:40:47,488 --> 01:40:48,000
True

2238
01:40:48,512 --> 01:40:54,656
Now we haven't seen him with his I wouldn't look I haven't seen him naked I'm not saying he hasn't carved just wants to cuss

2239
01:40:55,424 --> 01:40:55,936
It's interesting

2240
01:40:57,472 --> 01:40:58,240
Everett proof

2241
01:40:58,496 --> 01:40:59,008
Evidence

2242
01:41:05,408 --> 01:41:06,432
Something like that

2243
01:41:06,688 --> 01:41:07,712
Mike Adams

2244
01:41:07,968 --> 01:41:08,992
Now is predicting

2245
01:41:09,248 --> 01:41:10,528
Hundreds of Millions

2246
01:41:10,784 --> 01:41:11,296
Will be dead

2247
01:41:11,808 --> 01:41:14,112
Because of the vaccine do not because of covid

2248
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:16,928
And you got to lose you don't get to

2249
01:41:17,184 --> 01:41:22,304
You just got to say goodbye to you and your family right

2250
01:41:23,328 --> 01:41:24,096
All the things you just mentioned

2251
01:41:24,608 --> 01:41:25,888
Take care of your health

2252
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:27,936
Avoid at all costs

2253
01:41:28,448 --> 01:41:30,240
And avoid other people who are vaccinated

2254
01:41:31,264 --> 01:41:33,312
We've got to continue to build out our independent

2255
01:41:36,128 --> 01:41:37,408
Continue to expand our

2256
01:41:38,944 --> 01:41:39,968
Mainstream media

2257
01:41:40,224 --> 01:41:42,016
Is collapsing in terms of its viewership

2258
01:41:42,272 --> 01:41:46,368
Viewing independent truth media even though the censorship is

2259
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:47,904
It has never been worse

2260
01:41:48,672 --> 01:41:49,696
We are winning

2261
01:41:49,952 --> 01:41:52,000
To those people who are willing to live

2262
01:41:52,768 --> 01:41:54,560
Those who want to commit suicide and die

2263
01:41:55,584 --> 01:41:56,352
Any longer

2264
01:41:57,632 --> 01:41:58,144
Within the bass

2265
01:41:58,912 --> 01:41:59,680
Wave goodbye to those

2266
01:41:59,936 --> 01:42:03,264
People cuz many of those people millions or even hundreds of millions make.

2267
01:42:04,288 --> 01:42:04,800
The survivors

2268
01:42:05,312 --> 01:42:06,592
Educate inform internet

2269
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:08,896
That's how we can rebuild Society after

2270
01:42:09,408 --> 01:42:09,920
Vaccine

2271
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:11,712
Is Unleashed

2272
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:14,528
It's a vaccine

2273
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:16,576
Holocaust absolutely

2274
01:42:17,088 --> 01:42:17,600
Maybe after

2275
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:19,392
More people

2276
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:21,952
We don't know

2277
01:42:28,352 --> 01:42:30,656
Thousands of times the people that died in the Holocaust

2278
01:42:30,912 --> 01:42:31,424
Is in a billion

2279
01:42:33,728 --> 01:42:36,288
Well I mean unless you believe the Holocaust

2280
01:42:36,544 --> 01:42:37,056
Didn't happen

2281
01:42:37,568 --> 01:42:43,712
Yeah I guess I got to take Mike's temperature on that talk about that

2282
01:42:43,968 --> 01:42:44,992
The number from the home.

2283
01:42:46,528 --> 01:42:47,040
This is this

2284
01:42:47,296 --> 01:42:53,440
Dramatic it is what though it's almost to the one-year anniversary of it's over for Humanity so it's a

2285
01:42:53,696 --> 01:42:58,048
So every year we Humanity around March

2286
01:42:58,304 --> 01:43:00,096
Beware the Ides of March

2287
01:43:00,608 --> 01:43:06,752
Yeah and then in a couple months Alex and Michael have a fight about something and I'll disappear for a few months back up

2288
01:43:07,008 --> 01:43:10,336
At to Adams as dramatic as ever

2289
01:43:10,848 --> 01:43:11,616
God it's just

2290
01:43:11,872 --> 01:43:12,896
He seems like

2291
01:43:14,432 --> 01:43:15,712
Teenager

2292
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:18,272
It really seems like

2293
01:43:18,528 --> 01:43:19,808
Somebody going through puberty

2294
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:21,088
Like

2295
01:43:21,344 --> 01:43:22,368
Feels like he's out of

2296
01:43:22,624 --> 01:43:23,904
Control with his own feelings

2297
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:24,928
Yeah or something

2298
01:43:26,976 --> 01:43:28,256
Just feel childish the way

2299
01:43:28,512 --> 01:43:29,024
Communicate

2300
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:30,048
Ya know it

2301
01:43:30,304 --> 01:43:30,816
It's insane

2302
01:43:31,072 --> 01:43:33,376
It's insane and it's insane the people allow this

2303
01:43:33,632 --> 01:43:35,424
A lot like people listen to this

2304
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:36,448
And don't go like

2305
01:43:37,216 --> 01:43:40,544
You said it was going to be over for Humanity last year this is Rerun

2306
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:45,408
But also the narrative has shifted so many times since then maybe almost even impossible to keep

2307
01:43:45,664 --> 01:43:46,432
Keep track of what it is

2308
01:43:46,688 --> 01:43:47,968
It's going to kill you exactly

2309
01:43:48,224 --> 01:43:50,016
How it's going to play out but

2310
01:43:50,272 --> 01:43:51,296
Don't forget that they've been

2311
01:43:51,552 --> 01:43:54,112
Consistent

2312
01:43:54,368 --> 01:43:56,416
It's important that we build our immune system

2313
01:43:56,928 --> 01:44:03,072
Separately the Infowars store as well as Mike Adams the health Ranger sell things that can boost your immune

2314
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:05,120
Quote unquote

2315
01:44:05,376 --> 01:44:08,448
He's selling like horse dewormer with me trying to push horse

2316
01:44:08,704 --> 01:44:09,216
Dewormer

2317
01:44:09,472 --> 01:44:10,496
Something you do back

2318
01:44:10,752 --> 01:44:12,544
Bleach dude

2319
01:44:13,056 --> 01:44:14,848
Right

2320
01:44:15,104 --> 01:44:18,432
Can you shoot

2321
01:44:18,688 --> 01:44:24,832
Alcohol ademola

2322
01:44:26,368 --> 01:44:27,392
Have yourself a fun time

2323
01:44:28,672 --> 01:44:29,184
Guest

2324
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:30,720
Before we get out of here

2325
01:44:30,976 --> 01:44:32,256
And it's

2326
01:44:32,512 --> 01:44:33,280
Stroud's

2327
01:44:34,816 --> 01:44:38,144
Stew's are becoming universally bad

2328
01:44:38,656 --> 01:44:43,520
Yeah it's a bad day for students

2329
01:44:43,776 --> 01:44:47,360
I'm going to have to get rid of that dish on my from my diet so bad

2330
01:44:47,616 --> 01:44:51,712
Yeah I would say that Stuart's interviewees largely

2331
01:44:51,968 --> 01:44:54,272
The same as the stuff that we talked about when he was on his Harrison

2332
01:44:54,528 --> 01:44:56,320
Smith choa so there's not really all that much

2333
01:44:56,576 --> 01:44:58,368
Have to go over but I do think it's really interesting

2334
01:44:58,624 --> 01:45:01,184
First thing this way that Alex is trying to engage

2335
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:01,952
With him where

2336
01:45:02,720 --> 01:45:08,864
He simultaneously wants to like really talk about how we should have a Revolutionary War

2337
01:45:09,120 --> 01:45:09,888
Really want the response

2338
01:45:10,144 --> 01:45:12,704
Stability of having said those things

2339
01:45:13,216 --> 01:45:18,336
Look I don't want to get into a gate of gate a circumstance all over here like

2340
01:45:18,848 --> 01:45:19,360
1

2341
01:45:19,616 --> 01:45:22,176
Degree away from the people who were in the capital

2342
01:45:22,432 --> 01:45:24,480
I kind of am too but maybe I wasn't in a group chat

2343
01:45:24,736 --> 01:45:29,344
RICO case was brought against you girls who

2344
01:45:32,928 --> 01:45:34,720
They're bunch of the Bill of Rights and Constitution

2345
01:45:36,768 --> 01:45:38,304
I decide you're going to confiscate the guns

2346
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:41,632
Inoculation the borders are wide open

2347
01:45:41,888 --> 01:45:43,936
Yes by any historical yardstick

2348
01:45:44,192 --> 01:45:45,728
We have every right to declare

2349
01:45:45,984 --> 01:45:47,264
7076 part 2

2350
01:45:48,032 --> 01:45:49,568
I just instinctively look at

2351
01:45:50,592 --> 01:45:52,640
Realize how they set this up politically

2352
01:45:53,152 --> 01:45:55,200
Now they want a civil war so China can take over

2353
01:45:55,456 --> 01:45:58,272
Governors of the political system

2354
01:45:58,528 --> 01:46:00,064
Stop this you may be right

2355
01:46:01,088 --> 01:46:03,136
There's no way to fix it or is there a way to fix

2356
01:46:03,648 --> 01:46:06,976
Claiming you on violence they're claiming you on offense

2357
01:46:07,744 --> 01:46:08,768
That's not the man I know

2358
01:46:09,024 --> 01:46:12,864
But at the same time if we're attacked

2359
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:16,192
Pass the Declaration of Independence

2360
01:46:23,872 --> 01:46:25,664
I don't want that

2361
01:46:31,808 --> 01:46:33,088
I do the same thing they did

2362
01:46:33,344 --> 01:46:34,624
How do you even respond

2363
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:35,904
To that

2364
01:46:36,160 --> 01:46:36,672
Question

2365
01:46:36,928 --> 01:46:37,440
Gramble

2366
01:46:37,696 --> 01:46:43,840
Hey so it's cool that we kill everybody I'm not saying we should kill everybody but it's cool that we kill everybody right

2367
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:49,216
Clip of Alex was just multiple times saying we have every Justice

2368
01:46:49,472 --> 01:46:51,776
Application for starting a Revolutionary War

2369
01:46:52,032 --> 01:46:54,592
Talking to government what the f*** Governors you talk

2370
01:46:54,848 --> 01:46:56,896
Dr. DeSantis

2371
01:46:58,432 --> 01:46:59,456
He would be a top

2372
01:46:59,712 --> 01:47:00,224
Anti-global

2373
01:47:00,736 --> 01:47:01,248
He would be someone

2374
01:47:01,504 --> 01:47:03,296
Who is any Governor will talk to Alex

2375
01:47:03,552 --> 01:47:04,064
I would suspect

2376
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:07,136
It might be he's on he's on the shortlist

2377
01:47:08,672 --> 01:47:14,816
It's just justifications for why a revolutionary war inoffensive violence could be set off which is actually offensive

2378
01:47:15,072 --> 01:47:19,168
Respond to that

2379
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:20,960
If you think there's no like

2380
01:47:21,472 --> 01:47:22,752
Yes yeah bro no

2381
01:47:23,008 --> 01:47:24,032
Super Broly

2382
01:47:24,288 --> 01:47:29,152
Yeah he's just like a a dudas walk-in take selfie

2383
01:47:29,664 --> 01:47:30,944
Yeah the capital of 26

2384
01:47:31,712 --> 01:47:34,016
I'm not going to let him hang out to dry

2385
01:47:35,552 --> 01:47:36,064
I just

2386
01:47:37,088 --> 01:47:38,624
It's so weird to

2387
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:39,648
Broadcast

2388
01:47:40,416 --> 01:47:40,928
Your

2389
01:47:42,976 --> 01:47:45,280
Extemporaneous fantasies about murdering

2390
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:48,096
That's a strange I would hope

2391
01:47:48,352 --> 01:47:50,656
You would keep that one quiet if you were like

2392
01:47:50,912 --> 01:47:53,728
I fantasize about murdering people all the time

2393
01:47:53,984 --> 01:47:55,776
So much so that I can

2394
01:47:56,032 --> 01:47:58,080
Cannot go several hours without talking about

2395
01:47:59,616 --> 01:48:00,128
You can

2396
01:48:00,896 --> 01:48:02,432
You keep those are ours off air

2397
01:48:02,944 --> 01:48:05,504
We'll see this is where we get back to what I was saying at the

2398
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:06,272
Beginning

2399
01:48:06,528 --> 01:48:09,600
Like that tone that Alex has where either coming back from

2400
01:48:10,112 --> 01:48:11,136
Like a week being gone

2401
01:48:11,392 --> 01:48:12,160
Any sleepy

2402
01:48:12,416 --> 01:48:14,720
I got to like I'm going to go to a special report

2403
01:48:15,232 --> 01:48:16,000
That's weird

2404
01:48:16,256 --> 01:48:17,536
Yeah but it's not weird for Ally

2405
01:48:17,792 --> 01:48:18,304
No

2406
01:48:18,816 --> 01:48:24,704
Being so obsessed with wanting to talk about your murder fantasies radio show is weird

2407
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:25,472
Yeah

2408
01:48:25,728 --> 01:48:27,264
His show is so stupid

2409
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:28,032
And

2410
01:48:28,544 --> 01:48:29,824
But that's just what this is

2411
01:48:30,336 --> 01:48:32,896
Yeah it's really it's really f***** up

2412
01:48:33,408 --> 01:48:33,920
That

2413
01:48:34,176 --> 01:48:34,688
There

2414
01:48:34,944 --> 01:48:35,968
Murder fantasies

2415
01:48:36,224 --> 01:48:40,064
Have gone so far from the original ones that we used to listen to where they're like

2416
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:42,624
If somebody tried to kill my family I'd

2417
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:44,160
Get to shoot them bunch of time

2418
01:48:44,416 --> 01:48:45,952
Which I don't want to do

2419
01:48:46,208 --> 01:48:49,280
I talked about doing it all the time if I don't want a gun

2420
01:48:49,536 --> 01:48:55,680
Is will rise up or whatever people and that's what we have to do

2421
01:48:59,264 --> 01:49:03,360
The point of justification for all of this they're attacking us with bio-weapon

2422
01:49:03,616 --> 01:49:04,128
Yeah

2423
01:49:04,640 --> 01:49:05,664
It's irresponsible

2424
01:49:06,688 --> 01:49:08,224
T i means I guess

2425
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:09,248
I feel good

2426
01:49:09,504 --> 01:49:13,600
Did Alex is back where he belongs in that chair

2427
01:49:15,136 --> 01:49:16,672
He doesn't belong in a grocery

2428
01:49:16,928 --> 01:49:17,696
Tree store unless it

2429
01:49:17,952 --> 01:49:18,720
Was locked from the outside

2430
01:49:19,488 --> 01:49:23,072
Yeah he's waiting out a zombie apocalypse

2431
01:49:23,328 --> 01:49:23,840
Exactly

2432
01:49:24,096 --> 01:49:26,656
Here you would be the guy who would lie about being bit

2433
01:49:26,912 --> 01:49:27,424
Totally

2434
01:49:27,936 --> 01:49:28,704
Absolutely

2435
01:49:29,216 --> 01:49:31,264
And he did enjoy eating you while he was

2436
01:49:31,520 --> 01:49:33,568
Still not a zombie

2437
01:49:33,824 --> 01:49:35,872
Just practicing

2438
01:49:36,128 --> 01:49:39,712
Eat your ass

2439
01:49:40,736 --> 01:49:44,320
How we come to the end of this and I don't think a whole lot happened

2440
01:49:44,576 --> 01:49:45,344
Alex is

2441
01:49:46,368 --> 01:49:47,136
Back but he's

2442
01:49:47,904 --> 01:49:48,416
I guess

2443
01:49:48,928 --> 01:49:49,440
Is upset

2444
01:49:49,696 --> 01:49:50,208
Yeah

2445
01:49:50,464 --> 01:49:51,232
Marvin Hagler

2446
01:49:51,744 --> 01:49:53,280
Stories that he's making up about him

2447
01:49:53,792 --> 01:49:55,840
He's mad about a bunch of other stuff he's making up
