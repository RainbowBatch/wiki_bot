1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for Tenaya Lodge Lake

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:01:02,720
Dot-com

5
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:05,792
Celine even talk a little bit about

6
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:07,328
Alex

7
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:11,168
Jordan Jordan

8
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,032
Dreamy creamy summer keeps on rolling

9
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:18,080
Although I don't know if it would roll it sort of

10
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:20,128
Pirates black

11
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,224
It's Platinum long over the sidewalk

12
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:30,624
It is melting down hill or something

13
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,648
I'd like to give a shout out to

14
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:34,720

15
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:39,072
No no no

16
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:41,888
Disqualified

17
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:42,912
Okay

Ice cream

00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:52,640
Alright

21
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,712
I don't think it's

22
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:58,016
Great I don't know

23
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:00,832
Maybe it's good maybe it's not I don't know but I enjoy it

24
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:03,648
Play little bit of chocolate and cinnamon situation going on

25
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:04,928
Great I'll tell you that

26
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:05,696
If you like that

27
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:07,744
Cinnamon roll

28
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:15,680
I could do that also everyone stop sending me pictures of The Grey Poupon ice cream

29
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:21,568
I got the mustard I don't know if it's real or not I don't care I will not be eating it

30
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:28,224
That's going to be at the end of December that's going to be like the demarcation

31
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,504
The 70s you know

32
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,320
You'll know whenever everybody is gone to ship

33
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:33,856
That's the way you do it

34
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:38,976
We could we could well I mean September 11th so

35
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:45,120
They would make mustard ice cream

36
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:49,728
My right side and you would think

37
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,776
Today being today

38
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:53,568
That Rafa winning is 40

39
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:55,104
You French Open would be my bride

40
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:57,664
I thought that happened already

41
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,504
He defeated Djokovic

42
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:04,576
Because defeating Djokovic was winning the French Open

43
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:09,184
What he did to a let's call him a man but what he left with

44
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,464
Today would make him

45
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:11,744
Suggest that he was not

46
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,096
See the other murdered this man the young guy who was a Hotshot

47
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:18,144
That you were into

48
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:23,776
Okay

49
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:29,920
Made it all the way to the final the French Open. Would be good to do that and then Rafa committed what could be

50
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:33,248
He described his vehicular manslaughter with a truck

51
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,296
Oh dude only 16 games

52
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:36,320
In three sets

53
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:39,136
636 360

54
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:42,464
My bright spot

55
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,304
I don't know how to assess that as a tennis court but it doesn't sound good

56
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,584
Okay it's real bad

57
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:55,264
To see cigarettes in concert yeah first time in 15 years

58
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,032
They are

59
00:03:56,288 --> 00:04:02,432
Absolutely as good as they were I'm sorry I couldn't join you I was busy working on this episode and then my computer crashed and I

60
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:08,832
I lost everything yes it would have been about

61
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,112
How do you qualify head

62
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:12,416
Well you would have gotten

63
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,184
Does e-cigarettes

64
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,208
That's true

65
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,744
But a good time

66
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,024
Amazing jump

67
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,815
You can't you can't describe it

68
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,863
Cigarettes my partner

69
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,679
She is not an interested fan of cigarettes

70
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:25,727
Imagination

71
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,007
But when you see them live

72
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,031
It's not

73
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,055
Just

74
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:32,383
That is likely to experience

75
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,151
Installation

76
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,431
I get the full on

77
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:37,759
Greatest track

78
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:42,111
I'm so Jordan what is not an art installation is the episode tonight

79
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:45,951
We are continuing our path through Alex Jones coverage

80
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:49,279
After the Uvalde shooting and

81
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:55,935
Subsequent Corrections statements made by public officials in Texas

82
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:00,031
That's when some of the stuff

83
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:01,567
Was starting to get a little bit

84
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:02,591
Mercure

85
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:07,455
The initial reports were very clearly like we got some of this

86
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,991
All wrong

87
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:11,295
I mean the weirdest part about living in the

88
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:13,343
The future now is that we know

89
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:15,647
What we're going to listen to the correction

90
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:16,927
Themselves are lies

91
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,975
Sure so it's like

92
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:24,095
We're going to hear them correct their own lies with who lies and we're going to be like this is what's supposed to be happening today

93
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:28,191
I get that and simultaneously

94
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:34,591
We don't really know even as we sit here today 100% of what you would really need to know

95
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:35,871
No in order to

96
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:38,431
Fully address

97
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:41,247
Some of Alex's claims that did this whole thing

98
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:47,391
Weekend we can deal with it as it as it appears and we can definitely see Trends and behave

99
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:50,975
Until well well perhaps some of

100
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:53,535
The fact-checking aspect of it might be a little bit

101
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:57,631
We may have to leave that for posterity to some extent

102
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:03,263
But yeah this is this this episodes pretty interesting I would say I think there are some

103
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,823
Very out of

104
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,359
Character moves

105
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,639
Interest that he make

106
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:15,807
Still not quite sure what I think about it I might need your help to

107
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,087
Through a little

108
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,439

Somebody is missing in action

135
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,807
Good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the

Some of the news here in the meantime but he is on his way

141
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,263
Sew-ins

142
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,799
It turns out Alex shows up

143
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:51,199
47 minutes into the show I believe

144
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,991
The youngest child graduation

145
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:59,391

00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:12,447
That's the saddest words in the world

149
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:15,007
Be welcome to the Alex Jones Show I'm Harrison

150
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:19,103
Underwhelming for sure it's not what you're looking for

151
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:24,991
You're looking a lot of times you get a strong sense that Alex is playing with lawyers

152
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:26,527
Or something but this

153
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:32,927
Brighten the right time of year for in the right time

154
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,207
Well that or anything

155
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:35,487
Listen to Infowars

156
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,767
Is going to go away

157
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:41,631
Daughters are forever it's nothing

158
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:46,495
And what did they broadcasted on the life

159
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,079
47 minutes

160
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:52,383
Into the show

161
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,175
Correction to me

162
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:04,415
Not also blaming the police we have a lot of inside information

163
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:06,975
Also been confirmed and we have Tim Enloe

164
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,255
Ashamed

165
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,535
Lee's trainer

166
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,095
I do actually use the Meghan Trainor

167
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,191
Police Department in courthouses

168
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,103
Contractor License

169
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:23,871
Continue

170
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,407
With this other stuff

171
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,991
Has a lot of sources a lot of mint

172
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:32,831
So Tim Enloe is Alex's security guy

173
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:38,975
He was also with him on January 6th with black water

174
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:42,303
Our our mercenary

175
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:46,655
Former mercenary Soldier of Fortune

176
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:50,751
Weird that Alex is coming right out of the gate being like we have a correction

177
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:53,823
Send to make appointment normal behavior for him

178
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,639
I think I should get one of these

179
00:10:56,895 --> 00:11:00,735
The instances the correction is much easier to to swallow

180
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,271
Or someone like Alex

181
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,039
It's because

182
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:04,575
And everybody's making

183
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,343
Can Corrections

184
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,111
Left and right

185
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,927
I don't think anybody has been like

186
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,463
Wow I mailed it

187
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:14,303
Yeah hero people directions to people who just

188
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:17,631
I don't know what's going on I'm not going to say anything

189
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:24,543
Yeah it's until I think that he recognizes that temperature is there and he has a chance to Pivot off whatever narratives he's on it

190
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:25,823
Start over

191
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,407
True Freedom true freedom

192
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:33,247
And so here is basically him doing that

193
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,783
But he specifically

194
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:37,087
Has a lot of sources a lot of Intel

195
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,391
This morning

196
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,671
Was that

197
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:47,071
It was a hostage situation because he wasn't shooting peep

198
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:49,887
Class Hosta

199
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:50,655
Stitch

200
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,239
He killed the cat

201
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,823
Everybody saying all the police are out there

202
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,711
It's horrible image of your children and

203
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,063
Process

204
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,855
It's a hostage situation

205
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:19,583
It looks like the way Alex is going to try to make sense of the delayed police response in the new information that's coming out is by claiming that

206
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,143
It wasn't actually a school shooting but instead was a Hosta

207
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,167
Situation

208
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,471
I can kind of understand how Alex will be coming

209
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,519
To this point but they're still major holes

210
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,287
Open this idea

211
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,335
It would make sense to claim

212
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,871
Maybe the police

213
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:32,639
Thought

214
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:34,431
But it was a hostage situation

215
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:37,247
But even that doesn't really make sense given the information

216
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,015
Unavailable

217
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,807
Also just one small note

218
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,599
Is this is going to be a little bit

219
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,647
Murky territory

220
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,415
Alex

221
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,183
Steve

222
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:49,023
Openly talking about having behind-the-scenes secret sources of information

223
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,071
So the way I was looking

224
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:55,423
Cafes with like judging him solely by what's public information chair

225
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:57,983
Kind of can't be how we approach this anymore

226
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:00,799
And we can have a little bit more of Our Own

227
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,079
Actual awareness

228
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,615
Of information

229
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,383
So

230
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,687
I don't know it's not going to be

231
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:11,551
But he is no longer bound by the public information rules

232
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:18,207
So I on May 27th the Texas Department of Safety

233
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,231
Steven McGraw

234
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:23,839
Gave a press conference where he explains the police decision to not bark

235
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,119
Through the classroom door

236
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,399
This was the result of

237
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:28,191
The commander on scene making the incorrect

238
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:30,495
Determination that the situation to transition

239
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:33,567
From an active shooter to a barricaded suspect

240
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:34,591
Which might deployment

241
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,359
Different tactics

242
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:42,271
Explanation included a determination that because there were so many shots fired immediately there was likely no one alive in

243
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,039
In the classroom

244
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:46,623
And they possibly the shooter was trying to lower them in so he could

245
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,903
Commit suicide by cop

246
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:48,671
Sure

247
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,207
So that also

248
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,487
Has problems

249
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:57,375
Because there were 911 calls that they received said the people were alive inside

250
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,655
Make sense

251
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,447
Using that

252
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,727
Kind of

253
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:02,751
View

254
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:05,311
Kind of see how Alex could make a leap

255
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,079
2

256
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,615
Hostage situation

257
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:08,895
Sure

258
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:10,687
But they're still proud

259
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:11,711
The first

260
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,479
Is it

261
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:13,247
The police

262
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,271
Treat this like a Hosta

263
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,039
Situation

264
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:17,855
They allegedly thought there were no more children at risk

265
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:19,135
It didn't think

266
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,415
Shooter had

267
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,719
According to the statements that were made in my Prescott

268
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:25,279
And there wasn't like a hostage

269
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,815
Negotiator that came in the tin

270
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,863
Landslide a phone in or anything

271
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:34,495
Alex had some basic details in here wrong about the shooter not killing people initially

272
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:35,775
Ultimately

273
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,567
It's nice of him to do a correction but

274
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,591
He's going to do another

275
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:43,455
Why bother

276
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,479
At this point

277
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,247
In time

278
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,855
The correction you make is this

279
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:52,159
They started saying some s***

280
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,183
Anna doesn't

281
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:53,951
Track

282
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:57,023
Cuz that's also not the same s*** they said earlier and now

283
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,559
When we said that it doesn't

284
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,167
Those m************

285
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:03,935
Foodlion

286
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:07,007
You can't do that and I'll explain why later obviously

287
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:08,799
You know

288
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,847
You have to do something

289
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:11,615
I think

290
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:13,663
Because Alex is entire narrative

291
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:19,039
Of the shooting hinged around the idea that this hero cop

292
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,855
I took the took the shooter out quickly

293
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:26,463
And that was something that was sold on his show and so now you need to

294
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:31,071
More details come out people in your audience are probably going to hear these things

295
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:33,119
That are contradictory to the story that you told

296
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,143
You can't keep going

297
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,167
The same Direct

298
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:37,215
Can you have a slightly different direction

299
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:39,775
This

300
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:40,543
Is

301
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,591
An interesting way to

302
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:43,359
To do it

303
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:44,639
I think

304
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:48,223
Doesn't it does not hold out it's real bad

305
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:51,807
Listen to The Main Street

306
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,343
That was really good

307
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:05,119
Brandon the school first shot of people at funeral home

308
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,191
Minutes

309
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,239
Border patrol agent

310
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:14,847
Border patrol agent

311
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:17,919
The door

312
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,223
Shooting star

313
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:24,063
The doors

314
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,111
Steel barrel

315
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:30,719
All the shootings going on

316
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,327
Get the door open show

317
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:39,679
Obviously

318
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,591
The left is using this form or defund the police

319
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,127
Federalize the police

320
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,943
So there's no indication of the classroom door operate

321
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:51,711
It's the way I was just

322
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:54,271
Describing like some kind of a Panic Room situation

323
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:58,623
Where once a lockdown is initiated can't be opened except by a very specific action

324
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,159
It was just like

325
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:02,207
Colonel McCraw was very

326
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:08,351
We're of that not breaking down the door was a decision the police made based on a miscalculation of the situation

327
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:12,703
Any press conferences even discussed how Ramos entered the classroom

328
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,031
Lock the door and then unlocked it to momentarily enter the hallway

329
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:18,591
Only to re-enter the room and relock the door

330
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:22,431
Additional problems with this idea Alex is putting forth

331
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,455
Here are one

332
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:28,063
If the police had a convenient excuse like we literally could not open that door

333
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,671
That would have been front-and-center as an explanation for what happened because it would make a lot

334
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:35,231
Of the worst details of this police response

335
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,255
Easier to understand

336
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,279
It'll be like well

337
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:41,119
Now we have a new problem we need to look at which is a would-be

338
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:47,519
Over-the-moon constantly repeating like we did everything we possibly could

339
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:51,871
Fingers would be coming to the manufacturer of the door

340
00:17:54,431 --> 00:18:00,575
And it would be a sensible deflection of of the conversation

341
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:03,647
Are guns weren't big enough to blow up that door

342
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:05,695
And we would have given more money to the car

343
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:12,351
Shuffle level of b*******

344
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,375
Nobody has bazooka

345
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:14,655
Just all the time

346
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:21,055
Sure that's what the second problem here is that that door whatever it is that has no bearing on the situation

347
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,847
If it actually was a hostage

348
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:23,615
Situation

349
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:27,199
You can take hostages in a bank vault or a treehouse

350
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:28,479
Like ultimately this

351
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:33,343
Just feels like a way that Alex is trying to make sure no one in the audience has too much of a bad feeling about the

352
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,111
Police

353
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:34,879
Like Mr play

354
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:36,415
Police state really it hits differ

355
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:39,743
In 2022 I think the one thing

356
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,535
That really

357
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,071
Disappointed

358
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,095
About

359
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:48,703
The the ideological re realignment

360
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:49,983
Is that

361
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,007
The left

362
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:53,055
And The Sovereign citizen

363
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,335
Adjacent types

364
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,359
Should be in

365
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,407
Accord regarding

366
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:58,943
Only

367
00:18:59,199 --> 00:18:59,711
Just like

368
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:00,479
Be careful

369
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:03,551
You know like I don't know no

370
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:06,367
Not okay well not all the way like The Sovereign citizen

371
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:12,255
Hilltop the traffic stops alright

372
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:16,095
You can also. The other direction where you defend them

373
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:18,655
Questioningly that is kind of strange

374
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:23,007
This impetus on Alex's bar but I think I do understand

375
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:26,335
As we go along I think I'd get that aspect

376
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:29,151
Guns are more important than not living in a police state

377
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,431
I don't think that's

378
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:31,455
What's going on

379
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:34,783
I think that there are certain Dynamics

380
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,855
That are essential for what Alex is doing

381
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,647
That require him to not be

382
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:40,671
Critical of Apple

383
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,487
Anything you make site to clear

384
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:46,047
Okay Alex really is into this

385
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:51,679
New narrative that it was primarily a hostage situation and not actually

386
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:52,959
School shooting

387
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:54,751
But this garbage one on

388
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,287
For an hour

389
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,711
That's what's going on

390
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:06,783
Tails are coming out

391
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:10,623
Democratic Party

392
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,975
Ancillary continue to try to give you the best most accurate information

393
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,119
Come on

394
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,911
Monday night

395
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:23,935
Come on

396
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:25,983
30 bottom of the hour

397
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,519
In about 40 minutes from now

398
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,311
To break it all down

399
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,127
Calling is contacts

400
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:33,663
Contacts everywhere

401
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:39,295
So he's got to Enloe the Exmark who's going to be his expert

402
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:43,903
Portion of this episode

403
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:47,743
Alright he's interview with with Tim which is

404
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:50,047
Less productive than

405
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,071
View my

406
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:55,167
I don't know what you would think it was

407
00:20:55,423 --> 00:21:01,567
It's fair enough trouble as soon as I started that sounds productive

408
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:05,919
Before Tim comes in there's other there's other things Alex

409
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,735
Complain about

410
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:11,295
Monkeypox

411
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,063
Oh my God

412
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,879
Other stuff going on

413
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:16,672
The new lockdown

414
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,744
Mongering

415
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:23,072
Finally a lot of leaders.

416
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:25,120
Today

417
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:34,848
We can't allow this

418
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:39,456
Turn off the fossil fuels going to kill

419
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,760
Collapses

420
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:45,600
The left just has

421
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:50,208
Policies they don't know what they're doing or mousy tongue

422
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,496
About to kill millions of people

423
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,288
Before our eyes

424
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:05,568
That is a very

425
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:15,040
Everything is going on while the media

426
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:17,856
Does it blows it up

427
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:25,792
Vermillion

428
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:29,888
The problem is

429
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:33,984
Can't really find a way to articulate what he's

430
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,336
Sing Mary cuz he's like Alright look there's a lot of bad stuff so why

431
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:44,224
Why are we allowing the left in the globalist right turned this into the worst thing ever

432
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,808
Also even if you just killed one kid it would be the worst time ever

433
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,088
What are you saying

434
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:50,624
She just wants

435
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:57,024
Get to the endpoint where it's like this is obviously the less fault and it's fine if you be humanize them in Uno

436
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,560
Get rid of all of them I think he wants

437
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:04,704
To minimize the shooting but also realizes that doing so is a really bad look and distaste

438
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,520
Facebook I mean if your end goal is to say

439
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:08,288
No matter what

440
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,824
This isn't guns fault

441
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:13,152
Then everything that you're trying to make up

442
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:15,456
To get there is going to get eventually

443
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:20,832
Stupid

444
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:22,112
So there

445
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:24,672
Look we all know there have been a number of things

446
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:26,720
That I have been put forth

447
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:28,256
About

448
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,792
The early police response

449
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:30,560
That has

450
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:31,840
But not held up

451
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:33,632
That is definitely

452
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:34,912
Understand

453
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:35,680
Yeah

454
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:37,472
Alex blamed the media for this

455
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,736
Media first reported

456
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,904
But the media

457
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:00,000
They shot the police

458
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,792
When is the school shooting

459
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,312
The police didn't know it was going on the side

460
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:19,200
Barricaded inside then

461
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:25,856
Here and there in the news they're admitting that's the case

462
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,560
So again there's no Stand Down

463
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:35,328
Lamport

464
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:38,912
And you will get to that eventually at some point

465
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:45,312
How to Alex's acting like the media wasn't just reporting what the spokespeople for the Texas Department of Public Safety

466
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,080
You were saying

467
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:52,736
He sincerely is trying to suggest that I would like CNN or the X who definitely did get stuff wrong we're just make

468
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,016
Taking those things up

469
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:59,136
The reason for this is because Alex constantly makes things up and he assumes that everyone else does too

470
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:05,536
He doesn't seem to have a concept that other people don't base their reporting on hunches Vibes and made-up decades-old

471
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:06,304
Prophetic vision

472
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,072
Like he does

473
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,352
But

474
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:09,376
I mean it would cause some

475
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:11,936
Confusion obvious

476
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:18,336
Reality behind that though is if you follow at equality Alec on Twitter he's obsessed with Copic

477
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:19,872
Ganda and the way that the media

478
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:22,176
Just accept unquestioningly

479
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:23,200
The things that the cops

480
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:25,504
Tell her just put it as their own sources

481
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:31,904
And that's where we are so if you want to criticize the media in this situation that because they unquestionably reported

482
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:40,352
A different criticism totally a different kind of valid

483
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:42,400
But he doesn't

484
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:45,728
No cuz that would be productive productive

485
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:47,008
Ain't this is what

486
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,080
I think part of a big part of what's going on and that is

487
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:56,224
Situation realistically would have some difficulty getting off the ground

488
00:25:56,736 --> 00:26:02,880
Alex is trying to push this new narrative 40 Menlo has this inside Intel about I was a hostage situation but

489
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:05,696
This information is coming from where

490
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:12,352
The credibility of what Tim has to say rest entirely on the notion that he's relaying information from high-level law enforcement sources

491
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:14,144
Score familiar with a case

492
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:17,728
If that's the game you're playing you can't also be sniffing out a mess

493
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:21,568
Conspiracy where the police are being forthright about the response to the shooting

494
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:24,384
And if given inaccurate statements to the Press multiple

495
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,408
Full-time so far

496
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:31,552
If you attack The credibility of the police you're hindering your ability to pass off whatever information Tim has

497
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:33,600
Has being meaningful or at very least

498
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:37,952
You may have to explain why the information the police have released publicly has been iffy

499
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:40,256
And the information released the Tim should be believed

500
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:46,144
By making these inaccuracies and misreporting that's gone on in this case a situation where the media lied

501
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,448
You can sidestep the need to explain anything

502
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,032
Hannah gives you a chance to take a fraudulent cheap shot at the media while you're at it

503
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:53,824
Big part of

504
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:54,848
What are you doing

505
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:55,872
Yeah

506
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:57,152
I mean

507
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:57,920
You can't

508
00:26:58,176 --> 00:27:00,480
Assume that the police are lying

509
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:02,016
You have a

510
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:02,784
Or even

511
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,808
Like if you want to put it

512
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:05,856
It's super benevolently

513
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:08,416
Fumbling their public statements so terribly

514
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:09,696
That they have to make

515
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:12,000
Fundamental

516
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:18,400
You can't have that and also try me like we have inside or police sources who are giving us the real skinny

517
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:19,936
Because

518
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:22,240
Then you have whistleblower so you don't have

519
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,264
Tide information

520
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,568
If the official narrative is bulge

521
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,360
And you've got a

522
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,640
On the background

523
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:34,016
Anonymous sources coming in to tell you the truth than they are telling you the whistleblower's report

524
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,576
That means that either

525
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:38,624
Everybody

526
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,416
The whistleblowers are telling the truth

527
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:43,488
Yeah yeah and it gets too complicated after that point

528
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:44,256
Can't do it

529
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:45,280
Never

530
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:50,656
Another school shooting

531
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:52,960
And realize

532
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:53,728
Is about

533
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,336
He is going to be in studio with us

534
00:27:58,592 --> 00:27:59,360
He has contacts

535
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,176
Right now

536
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:03,968
Exactly what went on inside

537
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,784
That building when the police

538
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:10,368
Globalist

539
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:12,160
We expose them

540
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,512
Robbers and Killers you see all the time

541
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:19,072
School shooting last year

542
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:25,728
He was out the next morning from

543
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:30,592
Weirdo Alex amazing we went to racism

544
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:31,360
So fast

545
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:37,760
Yeah it definitely seems like a relevant detail in this case and not something that he's just bringing up because it reinforces the White victimhood theme of his show

546
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:43,392
White people get away with everything this isn't necessary for this

547
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:44,416
Going to throw this in there for

548
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:49,536
For fun so this guy because his parents paid bail

549
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:54,912
Like I guess Alex wants people detained without bail at being what do you want

550
00:28:55,168 --> 00:29:01,312
He's injured four people after bringing gun to school and shooting at a guy who got in a fight with and in February

551
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:03,616
You're a grand jury indicted him on seven charges

552
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:05,920
Including 34 attempted murder

553
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:12,320
Like Alex is acting like they just let him go I mean no trouble

554
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:18,720
The impression that he wants the audience to have in their head fries he hasn't kept up with this case

555
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:23,072
Lying about it and he's like these black people just get away with everything

556
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:25,888
Whenever and whenever you be even when you like look

557
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,704
EBay further into that store you're like way to sec

558
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:35,104
Cash bail system is so f***** up how does this kid get to get out whenever so many other people would be in there because I can't

559
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,456
Like there's a larger question around that that he's not even f****** willing

560
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,248
Sure

561
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:47,904
As is always the case with Infowars stories inside a larger useful question

562
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,696
That is just completely ignore

563
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,488
So

564
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:56,608
Alex has to deal a little bit with the notion that they didn't let the

565
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:57,376
The parents

566
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:01,472
Yeah that one's going to be real tough to try and lie about

567
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:03,008
Let's just say

568
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:05,312
He does not deal with some of the

569
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:07,872
More troubling realities of

570
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:09,920
The paratroopers

571
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:11,456
Well maybe doesn't know

572
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:13,504
Right I'm not sure that the cops

573
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:17,088
Off to one of the parents I'm not sure

574
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:20,160
He thinks it's an unfortunate but sensible thing

575
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:20,928
Get Smart

576
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,720
Absolutely

577
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,768
Learn from this app

578
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:27,584
Just to say

579
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:32,448
It was a hot

580
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:33,472
Hostage situation

581
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:35,008
What was going on

582
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:40,128
And information changes we will definitely let you know

583
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:47,808
Monkeypox

584
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:52,160
The Western world and

585
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:54,208
More shortages coming as a supply chain

586
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,512
Breakdown

587
00:30:57,536 --> 00:31:01,120
Now to keep Infowars on the air because our supply chains broken down Ark

588
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:12,896
Currently $8000000 in Bitcoin is not enough to get him to buy a little class

589
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:14,944
Wow

590
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,736
Pretty smooth

591
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:21,088
It's pretty smooth

592
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:21,856
And but if

593
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:23,392
If you buy my stuff

594
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:26,464
Then maybe the cops will do better next time

595
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,792
Palm Terrier horrible things

596
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:36,192
But not of those are why you got to keep me around listen if you don't buy my products then who is going to tell you when these Arab

597
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,056
I have made materially no

598
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:45,664
In terms of solving any of the problems that I'm yelling about

599
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:49,760
And in fact I have misreported on pretty much all of them

600
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:52,576
That's why you need to give me money to keep me on a hair

601
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:53,856
Excuse me

602
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:54,624
Libertango

603
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:56,160
I'm going to play you a clip

604
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:57,952
From 1998

605
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:00,256
And it'd be saying the same thing that I'm saying

606
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:01,280
Today

607
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:03,584
How do you feel about that

608
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,632
25 years in between

609
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:07,936
What's the I think they actually like

610
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:09,984
If it's somebody who's like we need to lower taxes

611
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,776
It's like it shows ideologic

612
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:13,568
Consistent

613
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:15,360
That's nice

614
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:16,128
But

615
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:22,784
If it comes tomorrow

616
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,856
Consistent Maybe

617
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:30,976
Expression anything throw that money somewhere else yeah some bad news

618
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:32,256
About the New World Order

619
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:38,912
Ladies and gentlemen we are back on this Thursday May 26th 2022 transmission

620
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:43,520
It is

621
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:50,944
Does give

622
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:55,552
Power of the UN over National sovereignty

623
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:58,624
Publicly

624
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,160
The UN has

625
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:07,328
Veto power over country's sovereignty which speech to the nation did Biden come out and was like listen

626
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:13,728
I love being the president of the Free World and I have an absurd amount of power and influence and all that stuff but frankly

627
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:15,520
I'm going to give all of that up

628
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:18,592
To some people at the UN I don't know why

629
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:21,664
The UN is going to just be able to veto

630
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:25,248
Just like I'll be like way we view of sovereignty

631
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:28,576
I know you don't it's so funny to me

632
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:29,856
How obsessed

633
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:31,648
Alex's with the UN

634
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:32,672
And then at the

635
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:35,744
The same time like we are one of only three nations

636
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:38,048
Absolutely hate for you and

637
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:41,376
To their face like an Australian in Russia

638
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:42,656
Constantly going back

639
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:44,704
Forthwith like f*** you Europe

640
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:47,520
Over and over and over again

641
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:50,080
Yeah and just remember this

642
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:55,200
Is just about the amendments to the World Health Organization regulations

643
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:56,224
Where they can do

644
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,296
Declare that something is a a health emergency

645
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:03,136
Even if a country is not cooperating if it did happen

646
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:06,976
Three weeks into his we need to demonize China for covid

647
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:08,000
Good thing he would have been like

648
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:09,280
Now we've got a

649
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:11,584
No cuz

650
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:15,936
Something true

651
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:17,728
Yeah

652
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:22,848
Are you being over selling this amendment might be an overreaction

653
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:24,640
Maybe

654
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,176
Florida.

655
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:31,552
So we have very few instances of Alex learning

656
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:33,344
That is true

657
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,392
However I think this next clip indicates

658
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:36,160
At least

659
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:37,184
Something

660
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:37,952
Interested

661
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:42,560
Dismantling

662
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:47,424
Where in the world in the body

663
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:48,448
I don't want that

664
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:49,216
American

665
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,568
Heads above other countries on average

666
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:55,616
Unless

667
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:57,408
You live in Luxembourg or sweatshirt

668
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,040
Luxembourg Germany

669
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:05,088
Luxembourg

670
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:08,160
A person could not

671
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:09,696
Live in a place like that

672
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,840
Lowest crime rate in the world

673
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:16,608
Luxembourg

674
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:17,376
In France.

675
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:23,520
Oh I'm sorry I forgot that was excited

676
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:24,800
Switzerland

677
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:27,360
Is definitely country with the High Cost of Living

678
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:31,968
Three of their cities coming in the top 10 of Mercer's cost-of-living rankings

679
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:32,992
420 21

680
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:34,784
Zurich is number 6

681
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:35,808
Geneva is 8

682
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:37,088
Is 10

683
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:39,648
I'm going to assume that this is a place

684
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:43,744
It's so expensive to live that suddenly getting an 8 million-dollar windfall

685
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,512
Still wouldn't

686
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:46,048
Give you like a years

687
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:50,912
Brent book Alex's willowshade he could afford to live wherever you want course but also Luxembourg

688
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:52,192
Doesn't make that list

689
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:58,592
I don't know until number 63 Luxembourg City is 63 on the way higher than

690
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:04,992
Luxembourg Chicago 45 I could afford to live in Luxembourg

691
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:09,344
Based on the fact that I have survived Chicago

692
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:17,024
By the transitive property I am a Luxembourg in Luxembourg

693
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,304
Theory

694
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,072
Smaller

695
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:20,608
Literally in their art

696
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:21,376
Someplace

697
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:22,400
What is

698
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:24,192
Sure

699
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:24,960
Anyway

700
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:29,056
The country that's all I really

701
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:33,408
So are we get to this conversation with the Tim Enloe

702
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:35,200
Ex Blackwater fella

703
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,016
Because he used a Blackwater Inn

704
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:41,088
Kind of forgot about all that mercenary kills people

705
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:47,488
For my dad I was just to be used except as a thing that we talked about

706
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:50,560
But then this guy is like I'm going to go kill people for money you stupid

707
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:53,888
Anyway Alex that's a conversation by getting

708
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:54,656
Something's wrong

709
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:59,008
We're here to get the facts on happened Monday afternoon in Uvalde Texas

710
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:01,568
Friend

711
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:03,872
Timer for the police

712
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:04,896
Also doesn't

713
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:05,664
Courthouse

714
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:08,480
You want to get more

715
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:17,440
Vehicle

716
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:22,304
Schram

717
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:23,584
Holding hostages

718
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:25,632
Confirm but it's not being pushed

719
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:28,448
Dad

720
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,752
The police just go down

721
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:32,032
I'm not sure what to

722
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:36,384
Confirm means to Alex but again the media didn't just report these things

723
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,176
Like they didn't make them up

724
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:42,272
They were Miss statements made by public officials that were underneath the things that got missed

725
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:43,040
Reported

726
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:49,440
That's an important thing to understand like when the actual media is getting something wrong it's generally because there was an official that made

727
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:50,464
Inaccurate state

728
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:56,096
When Alex get something wrong like in this case how we reported that the shooter was Trans on Monday evening

729
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:59,680
It's because he saw some dumb s*** on fortunate decided to run with it

730
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:01,984
As if it meant anything there's a world of difference

731
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:06,080
These kinds of getting it wrong and Alex hasn't even owned up to

732
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:07,104
To the fact that he

733
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:12,992
No course not

734
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:14,784
Disgraceful Monday night coverage

735
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,832
Absolutely I can put somebody

736
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:18,624
Danger

737
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:19,648
It is

738
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,696
In his mind it makes

739
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:22,464
Perfect sense

740
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,488
That's cuz it's like Alyssa

741
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,072
I report on my sources you report on your sources

742
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:29,632
I don't know

743
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:30,400
Government

744
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:34,240
And my sources are weirdo randoms on Fortune I don't know what is

745
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:36,288
What's so different between you and I

746
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:39,616
Because the weirdos in the government

747
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:40,640
Cat always

748
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:43,200
Be correct

749
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:46,272
That does not make him equivalent to a random person on Torch

750
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:48,320
Feel like Alex

751
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,600
Sitting across from Blake's

752
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:50,624
Buckhead

753
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,440
Edward armero

754
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:54,720
Heat like we're not so different

755
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:57,280
You know what to say

756
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:59,840
Simple fact

757
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:01,120
But Alex is getting wrong here

758
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:04,960
The first is that Ramos did start firing pretty much immediately

759
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:11,360
He was shooting at the school prior to entering and within his first minute or so inside he shot over 100 rounds

760
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:15,456
The door wasn't an armored door and there's no indication that this was a hostage

761
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:17,248
What are the things that worry

762
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:19,040
Please me about hearing Alex talk about a Hosta

763
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:24,160
Message situation is that there's a certain high-profile hostage negotiator that Alex is friends with

764
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:27,488
And this could be a way to shoehorn pechanec back into the show

765
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:28,768
I was worried about that

766
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:29,792
A boy

767
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:33,888
I checked Steve Twitter and it appears that he's never been in on this hostage

768
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:35,936
Degenerative

769
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:37,472
Something I was getting from him all right

770
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:43,104
But he does definitely think that it's a staged false flag possibly with actors

771
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:43,872
Spaetzle

772
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:47,200
Apparently Steve gameplay false flag on Twitter so he calls fingers

773
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:47,968
French fries

774
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:48,992
French fries

775
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:50,784
Instead of false flag

776
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:52,064
Alright

777
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:53,088
Okay

778
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:53,856
That's

779
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:56,416
Words

780
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:59,488
So Alex one of the main thrust

781
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:02,560
It really is running through so much of this

782
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:03,584
He's just

783
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,144
Just like he does not want people to like

784
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,424
Blame but

785
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:11,520
You sure with us to talk about this

786
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:14,336
Hi and he can give you what a sources are telling him and

787
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:15,616
You should known

788
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:19,968
Show again

789
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:26,624
Changing the song The Police

790
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:30,976
Izzy Izzy

791
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,840
It's just a little childish

792
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:36,864
To pretend that you

793
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,936
You can't have criticism of the police response

794
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:44,288
And also at the same time keeping your mind that the person who did the shooting his response

795
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:45,824
Audible for doing the shooting

796
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:47,616
That is absurd

797
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:50,944
That Alex has that kind of a expectation of people

798
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:51,968
Being only able to

799
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:53,248
Keep one thought in their mind

800
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:57,344
I guess f******

801
00:40:58,112 --> 00:41:00,416
Politics brain in 2022 it's always

802
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:01,696
Everything is always

803
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:05,024
Distilled back down until what the right or the left

804
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:05,792
You're doing and it

805
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:07,072
It's this and it's that and it

806
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:13,216
You know what though here's a thought I'd just had was that you can only keep one thought in your head when someone's yelling at

807
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:16,032
Sinestro

808
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:17,056
So maybe

809
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:19,360
That's why you yellow people to try and focus

810
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:25,760
Kiss Batman 21 thought otherwise all over the place

811
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:27,296
So maybe Alex has an X

812
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:28,320
PlayStation theater

813
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:30,624
The audience can only keep one thought in there because

814
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:33,696
Through 20 years of empirical evidence right

815
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:39,584
Them getting yelled at by family can only keep one thought is I don't know

816
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,912
To look at his 25-year ass career and be like

817
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:44,448
I think we understand it.

818
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:46,240
True

819
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:47,264
So Tim

820
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:48,544
I got to say

821
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:50,848
The information that he provides

822
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:51,872
Sounds

823
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:56,479
Fairly similar interests who the stuff that is said by

824
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:57,759
Colonel McCraw

825
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:00,063
The next day at the Prescott

826
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,855
So I am not

827
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:02,623
2

828
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:04,671
Are off from believing that Tim

829
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:07,487
Absolutely does I have some police sources

830
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:09,791
Probably has

831
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:13,887
Line on the information that would be

832
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:15,679
Given now

833
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:20,543
Sorry this is such a f*****-up situation in our in our

834
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:21,823
Perspective of it

835
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:24,639
Because Alex is trying to Parrot the truth

836
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:26,431
When he never does

837
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:28,223
And in so doing is wrong

838
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:30,271
Alex has the source

839
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:32,319
With actual sources

840
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:35,135
Which never happens

841
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:37,439
Seemingly yes they're wrong

842
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:44,095
And it's one of the things that's even weirder about it

843
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:45,631
Is that

844
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:49,215
Know for sure obviously but it sounds a lot like

845
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:51,775
The information that came out the next day air

846
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:56,127
It's not the information that Alex is reporting

847
00:42:56,639 --> 00:43:02,527
And I think that there was a weird distinction here right here's the basic gist of what Timber

848
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:06,111
The first one

849
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:08,415
In the very very early stages of

850
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:10,719
The investigation risers

851
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:13,023
Literally every hour every day

852
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:14,047
Bright sofa

853
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:19,679
At the entrance that is

854
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:22,495
Appears.

855
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:24,799
That's a Some Kind of contact was made with

856
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:25,567
With the shooter

857
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:28,639
He went into the

858
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:29,407
School

859
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:30,687
And then somehow

860
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:36,063
And then potentially lock

861
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:38,367
That door or somehow barricade

862
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:39,391
Door

863
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:42,463
Couldn't immediately go in after

864
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:46,047
The other thing is that I'm hearing is that

865
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:49,887
Guy ran into school

866
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:50,655
Start shooting

867
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:54,495
But now they're saying that he may have been in that classroom for up

868
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:55,263
Words of

869
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:56,799
30 to 45 minutes

870
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:57,567
Not

871
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:02,431
Is a bear

872
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:06,527
Call rather than an active shooter

873
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:11,903
Now that matches fairly closely with what the colonel said the neck

874
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:17,023
That does not describe a hostage situation. And there's a couple of very important

875
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:17,791
Distinction

876
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:21,119
One is that when in love

877
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:24,191
That he wasn't shooting for long periods of time

878
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:26,239
Is

879
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:27,519
True

880
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:29,567
And enough in terms of

881
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:31,359
It's like matching information that we have

882
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:35,967
But you also is ignoring the part where they were that over 100 round shot

883
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:36,735
Right

884
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:39,039
There is

885
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:40,575
There's element

886
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:41,599
Of this

887
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:47,999
That the mixing some of the wrong stuff with some of the stuff that would come out the next none of it adds up to

888
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:49,279
The conclusion that Alex's

889
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:55,679
Clearly using this information right build the hostage situation narrative

890
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:57,215
The way he's reporting this

891
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:59,263
He came in with the gun

892
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:01,055
Didn't kill anybody

893
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:03,359
I'm in an hour later

894
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:04,127
Started killing

895
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:06,687
Because it was a hostage situation

896
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:11,551
Will presumably I don't know what the goal was or what he was trying to hold them hostage

897
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:12,319
4

898
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:15,135
Thought on that

899
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:19,487
You can see hear something with that bed Dynamic is really really interesting I've

900
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:21,023
That Tim

901
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:24,351
Probably is getting information from the police

902
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:27,423
And Alex is embellishing on top of it

903
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:30,751
Yeah it is it is a little bit like

904
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:32,799
What we're seeing from the police

905
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:34,335
In this situation is

906
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:36,639
Very similar to like a f******

907
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:37,919
Teen

908
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:39,711
Like a teen who got caught

909
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:45,087
Not doing something and just really doesn't want to tell though the stuff that really makes him look bad

910
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:48,415
Each time they tell the story it's sure there's a little bit this

911
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:51,231
And I'm willing to admit that I made some mistakes here but

912
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:53,791
This is what I really didn't you're like no you f****** didn't

913
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:55,071
And so on and so forth

914
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:58,143
And then Alex is out here like a f******

915
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:03,519
Best friend he didn't do nothing he didn't even more is that

916
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:11,455
Yeah it is a little strange how much damage control Alex essentially doing

917
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:12,479
4 police

918
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:19,135
I just I hate having to live in a world where we live through all these Obama years where these people

919
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:20,415
Where the f******

920
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:24,255
We'll start shooting and we're amazing aware the f****** strong

921
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:27,583
Tea party s*** another whinging bootlickers

922
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:30,399
Trying to protect the cops from even the slightest bit

923
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:31,679
Accountability

924
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:35,775
The case also coming up later

925
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:42,175
Alex revealed a little bit too much about where is headspaces the police

926
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:43,967
Protesters are eventually going to cause a problem

927
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:46,271
So

928
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:49,343
Tim believes that what the problem

929
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:50,879
Homestead

930
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:54,975
Police just didn't have the tool that they needed to get in that door

931
00:46:58,303 --> 00:46:58,815
Crazy people

932
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:04,959
That hardening once they're in to get the police off

933
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:05,983
That's exactly right

934
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:07,775
And unfortunately

935
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:14,687
At least initial

936
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:16,991
Officers that were on scene

937
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:20,831
Probably did not have the breaching equipment that

938
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:22,879
To immediately breached

939
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:27,999
Right

940
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:29,023
And so obviously.

941
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:29,791
Problematic

942
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:32,095
Have to look at it

943
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:34,655
You know there's already and you covered it

944
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:36,703
For the last few days ride

945
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:39,519
Cries about all we need to do something gun control

946
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:41,823
The usual drivel that we hear from the left

947
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:46,943
What we're really dealing with here is not taking things away

948
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:51,039
For example

949
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:54,879
Every law enforcement officer should have a

950
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:56,415
Breaching tool in his car

951
00:47:58,207 --> 00:48:00,255
It well either battering ram or some kind of

952
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:03,583
You know like that sometimes

953
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:04,863
Pry bar

954
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:07,423
Seems like Alex with B deposed

955
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:08,703
To that

956
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:09,471
In the past

957
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:12,287
I know that

958
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:16,127
Militarisation Andover over accessorizing the police

959
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:18,175
Kind of one of his big issues

960
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:22,783
Yeah but also this doesn't match up with somebody information that we've gotten

961
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:23,551
Consent

962
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:27,647
The notion that it was a choice to

963
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:28,671
Not

964
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:30,463
Lakebridge the door

965
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:33,535
And that it was just locked

966
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:38,911
And they had to go find a teacher with keys

967
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:41,983
Said the school resource off

968
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:44,543
Officers with keys to every door in the

969
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:47,871
Most of them

970
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:48,895
If not all

971
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:50,175
Well

972
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:52,479
Well I mean what's the point of having a police officer if you

973
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:54,271
You can lock them out of your room

974
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:56,063
Fair enough

975
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:57,855
So

976
00:48:58,623 --> 00:48:59,135
The tissue that you

977
00:48:59,391 --> 00:48:59,903
I really have to get there

978
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:04,511
Sorry I shouldn't have but I should have thought

979
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:07,327
Yeah I know I sent that you were thinking

980
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:08,351
And you shouldn't do that

981
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:12,191
Seasonic which is great

982
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:18,591
The villains

983
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:22,175
Obviously

984
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:24,735
The police in Texas we know wanted to go in in

985
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:27,807
Kill this this is crazy

986
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:38,047
Obviously the primary responsibility for the shooting is on the shooter but this is a pretty embarrassing

987
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:39,327
Send presentation from Alex

988
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:40,607
Just the way he's going about

989
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:47,519
There's some very serious anomalies with this situation and his world's number one conspiracy theorist and

990
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:49,055
Arch-nemesis of the police state

991
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:51,359
His to implore the audience not

992
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:52,895
The question details of

993
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:54,687
Response a banana

994
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:57,759
I'm empathetic to the police and what they have to go through

995
00:49:58,015 --> 00:49:59,551
Particularly on a day like that

996
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:03,135
But to pretend that the media is unfairly scrutinizing this thing or

997
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:05,183
The people are blaming them for the shooting

998
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:06,719
Dishonest framing

999
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:10,815
This is so out of character for Alex that I don't know what to think

1000
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:17,471
The police have said that they didn't enter the classroom because they felt they were no longer kids at risk and things have gone

1001
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:20,287
YouTube from an active shooter to a barricaded suspect

1002
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:26,431
But this is severely called into question by the numerous 911 calls that people made from inside the room

1003
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:27,967
Unless no one was talking

1004
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:32,319
Do anyone else that assessment of the situation that they made shouldn't never

1005
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:34,367
Have been that far off from reality

1006
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:37,951
A detail like that is what Alex makes his living off of

1007
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:42,047
You go back and you look at all of his supposed to submission to bypass

1008
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:44,607
Best mass shootings and they're all stuff like that

1009
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:51,007
In terms of Sandy Hook Alex made a big deal out of the erroneous claims from Wolfgang halbig like that they didn't let

1010
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:53,055
The paramedics and EMTs into the school

1011
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:56,127
And he latched onto s*** that flimsy in order to craft

1012
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:57,407
Conspiracy narrative

1013
00:50:57,919 --> 00:50:59,711
And yet in this case he doesn't seem

1014
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:02,015
To be doing the thing that he tends to always

1015
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:04,063
I mean it is

1016
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:04,831
It is

1017
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:06,111
Almost

1018
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:07,647
Cosmically ironic

1019
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:09,439
It is almost

1020
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:10,719
Cosmically

1021
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:11,743
I have

1022
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:12,767
Finally

1023
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:13,535
Taken

1024
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:14,815
One thing

1025
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:16,607
From the past 4 years

1026
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:17,887
Sandy Hook lawsuits

1027
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:20,703
Which is I'm not going to question

1028
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:23,263
Whether or not what's going on happen

1029
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:24,287
And this is

1030
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:25,311
She's the one

1031
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:27,103
F****** time in his career

1032
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:30,687
Well no it's not but you know what I mean

1033
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:33,759
Like conspiracy theorizing about this

1034
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:37,087
Even conspiracy theory rising in terms of the lease I think it's irresponsible

1035
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:38,111
But

1036
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:40,159
Having some questions about like

1037
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:43,231
How was this misconstrued so badly

1038
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:47,583
Where was the decision made that was so wrong

1039
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:49,119
In terms of the response

1040
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:50,143
How how did

1041
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:53,215
Taking a full accounting of how this happen

1042
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:54,495
Is

1043
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:55,775
Something

1044
00:51:56,287 --> 00:52:02,431
You know himself on he questions thing yeah

1045
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:03,455
Not doing that

1046
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:04,223
Yeah

1047
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:05,759
He's questioning other aspect

1048
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:06,527
To this

1049
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:10,111
And whether or not whether or not the shooter was

1050
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:12,159
Isn't the Satan or something yeah

1051
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:13,183
Yep

1052
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:15,231
I don't know

1053
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:15,999
I don't know

1054
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:19,839
Cuz it seems like the conspiracy is that afterwards part you know like it's

1055
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:22,399
Fairly clear from what we do know and can at least

1056
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:24,447
Concretely understand is that

1057
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:27,007
All of these cowards walked in and

1058
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:28,031
Drip just acted

1059
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:28,799
Cowardly

1060
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:32,383
And then later whenever people started questioning they were like oh s*** this

1061
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:34,943
This is not how we want to be presented we're supposed to be like f***

1062
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:38,271
King Leonidas in the 300 protecting the people

1063
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:42,367
From the onslaught of the f****** Persian so they made it up that and they tried to coordinate

1064
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:44,671
And then it fell apart cuz they can't

1065
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:47,999
There's a lot of appearances

1066
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:50,303
Yeah I have a difficult time

1067
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:52,607
Fully signing on to what you're saying

1068
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:56,191
There are some leads that you're making sure but

1069
00:52:56,703 --> 00:52:59,519
It's there's going to need to be a lot of explanation

1070
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:00,543
Because

1071
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:04,639
It's confusing it's it's a it's a situation that

1072
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:05,919
Is boggling

1073
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:09,247
There are there are

1074
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:10,783
Potentially

1075
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:17,439
Interesting explanation conspiracy

1076
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:21,023
Totally I think one of our I mean ultimately the root cause

1077
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:22,303
Is we have

1078
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:24,863
An entire now 5th

1079
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:25,887
Branch of government

1080
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:29,727
That is entirely built around not taking responsibility for anything

1081
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:33,567
I mean there's a problem there yep that's true

1082
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:35,103
So look Alex doesn't worship

1083
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:35,871
Bring the cops though

1084
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:37,663
I mean kind of

1085
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:38,431
But he's not real

1086
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:40,735
I'm not hearing some

1087
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:43,551
Worship the police brown-nosing position

1088
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:46,879
Because I know the boys have their own prom licking their food

1089
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:52,511
Do you like the police

1090
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:54,047
Mobile control

1091
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:57,375
Get your children like I do

1092
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:02,239
How to get you in a gaucho

1093
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:03,263
Keep some of your children

1094
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:04,031
Graduation

1095
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:08,639
Graduation today

1096
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:12,991
You look at this you just can't imagine somebody

1097
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:17,855
Plumber to come to your house and fix

1098
00:54:18,111 --> 00:54:18,623
The pipe

1099
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:20,927
Police showing up

1100
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:28,351
Then that process happens

1101
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:31,935
This is a mess

1102
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:38,847
You can't

1103
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:39,615
Blame the

1104
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:40,383
Plumber

1105
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:41,407
4 knots

1106
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:42,687
Fixing your pipes

1107
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:43,967
What

1108
00:54:44,223 --> 00:54:45,247
Here's the thing

1109
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:46,527
I understand that

1110
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:48,319
50 part you know like Alyssa

1111
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:54,719
If I'm Xavier telling me like oh no and I'm a soldier in Iraq imagine them coming up over the thing

1112
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:58,815
Hang in there firing bullets at you there I would never be in that situation

1113
00:54:59,071 --> 00:54:59,839
They are because they

1114
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:00,863
Spent their life

1115
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:01,887
Training for it

1116
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:08,287
In theory training if you yes

1117
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:10,079
So if you're the cops

1118
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:16,479
I understand that you are sick I would want to be there.

1119
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:19,295
Yeah and I'm particularly empathetic to what you have to

1120
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:20,063
Experience

1121
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:22,879
So situation

1122
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:23,903
It's like it's

1123
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:26,463
Unsinkable

1124
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:28,255
But

1125
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:30,303
It doesn't remove

1126
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:31,583
The

1127
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:32,351
The sort of

1128
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:35,935
Responsibility to act

1129
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:37,471
Because that is your job

1130
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:41,311
Yep and you have that training you chose it

1131
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:42,335
You learned it

1132
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:44,383
You did all the stuff and then

1133
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:49,247
I mean and honestly you took our money to do it like we are paying you

1134
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:50,783
So

1135
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:52,831
So Tim has

1136
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:54,879
Something of an idea

1137
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:55,903
I think this is bad

1138
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:57,183
Vsn ID

1139
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:01,535
This thing I'm seeing in

1140
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:03,327
I didn't tell you this before

1141
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:04,863
Actually wrote

1142
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:06,911
Kids superintendent

1143
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:07,935
Yesterday right

1144
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:09,983
About the shooting in LA

1145
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:11,775
Everything in this standard

1146
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:13,823
Oh you know we're so sorry about

1147
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:15,871
Hearts go out

1148
00:56:16,383 --> 00:56:18,687
And he mentioned

1149
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:20,991
Presents possibly at the school for the next few days

1150
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:24,831
Priest police

1151
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:25,599
Presence

1152
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:26,623
Was an officer

1153
00:56:26,879 --> 00:56:27,391
Pretty much

1154
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:28,415
Enclosed

1155
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:29,439
Pistol

1156
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:32,255
That was inside the school kind of walking

1157
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:33,279
Bright

1158
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:38,655
Equipment

1159
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:39,423
Is that where

1160
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:40,703
Freight in this country

1161
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:42,239
Foreign officer

1162
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:44,799
To be walking around with an assault rifle

1163
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:46,847
The school wybie

1164
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:48,639
Because it freaks

1165
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:49,407
They think it's going to

1166
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:58,111
A bunch of kids be famous

1167
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:03,231
He wants

1168
00:57:03,743 --> 00:57:05,791
AR-15

1169
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:08,607
Cops in uniform basically at schools

1170
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:10,911
This isn't good you know the thing I was thinking

1171
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:11,679
Is that

1172
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:13,983
Sure America has the most

1173
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:15,775
People in prison ever

1174
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:18,335
And are worse than

1175
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:21,919
Apartheid-era South Africa and are racist to enforcement of that

1176
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:23,199
Policing

1177
00:57:23,455 --> 00:57:23,967
But

1178
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:25,247
The problem was

1179
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:27,295
Kids weren't already in

1180
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:30,623
Like what they should have done is my prisons from the

1181
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:31,391
Beginning you know like

1182
00:57:31,647 --> 00:57:33,695
You get you turn 60 you go to prison

1183
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:37,279
You got an armed guard walking around with an AR-15 make

1184
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:38,303
I'm sure that your

1185
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:40,095
Right

1186
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:41,375
That's got to be a every

1187
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:42,143
Preschool

1188
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:44,191
What's the best thing for

1189
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:47,775
In for school security

1190
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:49,311
I think these officers need to have a Arthur

1191
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:50,079
15

1192
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:52,127
Dwayne some lock

1193
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:54,687
Or somewhere but they need to have them on their person

1194
00:57:54,943 --> 00:57:56,735
They're big boys that are black

1195
00:57:59,295 --> 00:58:00,319
Should be standard

1196
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:05,439
Still don't have

1197
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:08,511
School resource officers or police officers station

1198
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:11,071
It's time that changes

1199
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:12,351
Preschool America

1200
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:20,031
Trained security officer or police officer

1201
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:23,359
Security guard

1202
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:25,663
I find this

1203
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:26,687
Trouble light

1204
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:29,759
It seems like parody honestly

1205
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:32,063
The dissolution you have is

1206
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:38,207
Like people sick every single school is got somebody toting an AR-15 around

1207
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:39,487
Great

1208
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:41,279
You know what's fun about

1209
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:45,631
People with AR-15s do you remember earlier on an episode when he was like

1210
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:48,191
Well we've got all these lockdown things and then

1211
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:49,471
But then when they get in they

1212
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:50,751
They can use the lock

1213
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:52,799
Sound measures against you

1214
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:54,335
Right now

1215
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:55,615
Let me throw this out there

1216
00:58:56,895 --> 00:58:58,431
What if I can't afford an

1217
00:58:59,455 --> 00:58:59,967
Bright

1218
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:00,991
I don't I don't work

1219
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:04,063
I do I'm just a harmless

1220
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:06,623
But I know where to get one

1221
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:08,927
Weekly around all goddamn day

1222
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:15,839
Yeah I mean do you know there are definitely stories of the good guy with a gun who gets his gun taken away from me

1223
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:16,607
No

1224
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:23,007
I don't know if it's seven-year-olds going to be able to get that AR-15

1225
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:23,775
That but like

1226
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:24,799
This is

1227
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:26,079
It is parody

1228
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:28,639
We've seen the same response from people

1229
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:29,663
That like

1230
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:31,199
Evereve School needs

1231
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:32,223
Good guy with a gun now

1232
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:34,271
In response

1233
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:36,319
What's to the single-most

1234
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:39,391
Apt example of why that's the worst idea

1235
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:40,671
Haha

1236
00:59:41,439 --> 00:59:43,743
I mean like in the situation in the shooting

1237
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:46,047
It definitely would not have helped

1238
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:48,863
Like unless

1239
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:49,631
I guess

1240
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:52,959
The person who happened to have the AR-15

1241
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:54,495
The Epic School

1242
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:56,031
Who is the good guy

1243
00:59:57,311 --> 00:59:59,871
Was right where the shooter enter

1244
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:01,663
Was at that door

1245
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:03,711
Is there a different part of the school

1246
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:05,759
The entrance still probably would have happened

1247
01:00:07,295 --> 01:00:08,063
And

1248
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:10,367
I guess once he's lock that door

1249
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:12,415
What you going to do

1250
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:15,743
Unfortunately it seems as though our defensive measures

1251
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:17,279
Are actually offense

1252
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:18,047
Towards us

1253
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:19,327
Maybe there's

1254
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:21,631
Maybe we're stupid

1255
01:00:22,143 --> 01:00:23,167
Do that

1256
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:29,055
So Alex needs to explain away a little bit of the fact that there was some Milling around

1257
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:30,847
On the part of police

1258
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:35,455
Sure these are these dudes say something that I just fine

1259
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:36,223
In Capri in

1260
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:42,111
Milling around outside waiting for orders at

1261
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:43,135
Bureaucracy

1262
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:49,279
Monday Morning Quarterback

1263
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:53,119
I think what we all need to meet need to come

1264
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:54,911
Come to the realization of his

1265
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:56,959
If there is a report

1266
01:00:57,215 --> 01:01:01,055
Or if a subject is seen going into school armed

1267
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:02,847
It doesn't matter it

1268
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:04,639
That moment if you shooting or not

1269
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:08,223
Pastor immediately

1270
01:01:08,479 --> 01:01:08,991
By law

1271
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:19,231
Applause

1272
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:20,255
Citizens

1273
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:22,559
A police as far as how to deal with

1274
01:01:22,815 --> 01:01:23,839
Force is authorized right

1275
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:25,887
I think I can

1276
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:28,703
Empirical data now it suck

1277
01:01:29,471 --> 01:01:34,079
That no one goes into a school

1278
01:01:34,335 --> 01:01:35,103
Good intentions

1279
01:01:37,663 --> 01:01:39,967
The police need to be trained to respond to that

1280
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:40,735
Huh

1281
01:01:40,991 --> 01:01:43,551
That's really interesting perspective for these dudes in 4th

1282
01:01:44,063 --> 01:01:47,903
For some reason they think there's a relevant difference between a person going

1283
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:51,231
To a school and a person with a gun going to a school

1284
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:56,351
There's such a difference between them that one is totally fine and normal and the other is someone who maybe should be

1285
01:01:56,607 --> 01:01:57,375
Be killed on sight

1286
01:01:57,631 --> 01:01:59,167
Because I possibly can today

1287
01:01:59,423 --> 01:02:00,959
Can't be up there any good it's impossible

1288
01:02:01,727 --> 01:02:04,287
It feels like a difference is that one of these people has a gun

1289
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:07,615
And then having a gun of bad intentions

1290
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:09,919
Because of where they are

1291
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:15,039
This isn't something people like Alex and Tim should ever accept as a possible conclusion because

1292
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:16,319
If you accept this

1293
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:22,719
So many of their gun arguments start to fall apart if you accept this I mean

1294
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:25,279
Stop it like just go f****** killed Kyle Rittenhouse

1295
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:28,607
That's what you said is okay to do

1296
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:30,911
But that's where you're going

1297
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:37,311
For them is that they're opening the door to accepting the idea that there's something about having a gun

1298
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:38,335
In a certain place

1299
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:40,895
Write that means that your intentions are bad

1300
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:42,175
And I can't believe that

1301
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:43,199
Nope

1302
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:45,759
Whole thing doesn't stand up to scrutiny

1303
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:49,599
If somehow having a gun is an indication of ill-will

1304
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:50,367
Yep

1305
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:55,231
So teacher should be allowed and forced to carry guns with them at all times

1306
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:57,279
And as we all know

1307
01:02:57,791 --> 01:02:59,839
People never leave guns out

1308
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:01,631
Where other people can get them

1309
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:04,959
Children are never interested in careers

1310
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:07,263
I don't pick up guns ever at all

1311
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:09,567
And definitely don't find themselves outside of the school

1312
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:10,847
Tell

1313
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:12,127
Those kinds of things

1314
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:13,407
Don't worry about it

1315
01:03:14,943 --> 01:03:16,991
Problem solved I think so

1316
01:03:17,247 --> 01:03:20,063
So Alex has some harsh words

1317
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:23,903
People who have been in their coverage

1318
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:29,535
Again we don't know yet if this is going to be a training issue

1319
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:30,559
They were waiting

1320
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:34,143
Because they didn't hear gunshots immediately or weather

1321
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:36,703
Couldn't get in we don't know

1322
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:43,359
Another left another is just disgusting opportunism

1323
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:47,967
Within a few hours after the shooting Alex relied on a 4chan

1324
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:49,503
Looks to report that the shooter was Tran

1325
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:51,807
Explain his part and a bigoted hate campaign

1326
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:55,903
Throughout that broadcast Alex and Owen incessantly accused psych meds

1327
01:03:56,159 --> 01:03:57,439
The being responsible for the shooting with

1328
01:03:57,695 --> 01:03:58,207
Zero evidence

1329
01:03:58,463 --> 01:03:59,743
The shooter was even on meds

1330
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:02,559
Something that they still have zero evidence up

1331
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:07,935
Now he's trying to get the cops off the hook for their inaccurate statements by reporting that this was awesome

1332
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:09,983
Situation of the media made stuff up

1333
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:11,007
The soul

1334
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:13,311
Feature of Alex's coverage has been

1335
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:14,335
Disgusting Opera

1336
01:04:14,591 --> 01:04:15,103
Humanism

1337
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:19,455
He can point the finger does nebulous Boogeyman of the life but he's just talking about himself

1338
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:21,503
That sucks

1339
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:28,671
No further to add one thing I will say is giving lip service to this

1340
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:29,695
Being state

1341
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:39,679
We're going

1342
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:41,983
It is just a Monica

1343
01:04:42,495 --> 01:04:43,007
Weird

1344
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:44,031
It is weird

1345
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:45,567
Weird

1346
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:47,871
I just can't believe

1347
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:50,943
I think it's only people on the right who care about the mixture

1348
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:57,343
They keep talking about the mister I care I care good bit about the midterms

1349
01:04:57,599 --> 01:05:03,743
Concerned I have I have some some worries

1350
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:05,791
Interesting hopefully

1351
01:05:06,047 --> 01:05:07,839
Can make some inroads

1352
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:09,375
But yeah

1353
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:12,191
The sense that you get

1354
01:05:12,447 --> 01:05:13,983
Is there is a lot

1355
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:16,799
Were the Republicans to gain if they could get all

1356
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:19,103
Of Congress and

1357
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:20,127
And die

1358
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:21,151
Courts

1359
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:23,711
Once they can cement their control it's never getting

1360
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:24,479
Undone

1361
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:30,623
I think that's kind of the way it goes though like it in

1362
01:05:30,879 --> 01:05:32,159
In Cycles when

1363
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:36,767
You know the one party wins the presidency there's maybe a little bit of a

1364
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:43,423
Demoralization come the next midterm because the president doesn't live up to the expectations of what you would have hope

1365
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:48,031
They they do kind of a common phenomenon sure and

1366
01:05:48,543 --> 01:05:49,567
It's unfortunate because

1367
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:51,359
Is a fairly important

1368
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:52,383
Midtown Promenade

1369
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:53,151
Yeah I mean

1370
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:54,175
If I was

1371
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:55,711
If I was the Democrats

1372
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:57,759
I mean

1373
01:05:58,015 --> 01:06:02,111
The problem is they're all going to die soon cuz they're all so old so they don't really care as much but

1374
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:05,439
Man if I wanted to ever have power again I would have done

1375
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:06,207
A lot of the

1376
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:08,255
Things differently

1377
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:09,791
Look Tim

1378
01:06:10,047 --> 01:06:12,863
Has this information that he's bringing forth Alex

1379
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:15,167
Is this the special exclusive

1380
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:16,191
Information

1381
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:19,775
And what is inside really interesting about it is that some of it is accurate

1382
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:23,103
At least in terms of what is going to be reported

1383
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:24,383
The next day

1384
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:25,151
Press conference

1385
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:26,687
And some of it is

1386
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:27,455
Not

1387
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:28,479
Some of these

1388
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:29,503
Very off

1389
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:30,527
Interested

1390
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:31,295
These are

1391
01:06:31,551 --> 01:06:32,831
This is very off

1392
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:34,879
So the latest

1393
01:06:35,135 --> 01:06:35,903
Which was

1394
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:38,207
Posted about an hour ago she says that

1395
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:42,815
He did Exchange

1396
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:43,583
Borrow gun

1397
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:44,607
Far was exchanged

1398
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:45,887
By the school

1399
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:50,239
And then he managed to get into school and then the latest report says

1400
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:52,031
At around 11

1401
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:54,079
43 am

1402
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:54,847
Reported killed

1403
01:06:55,615 --> 01:06:56,639
So we're looking at

1404
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:59,455
Wow you around 11 minutes

1405
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:01,759
What time he was shooting or

1406
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:02,527
There was

1407
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:03,295
Fire outside

1408
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:04,063
School

1409
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:06,111
Until reports are in that

1410
01:07:08,415 --> 01:07:09,183
We don't know if those were

1411
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:10,719
Inaccurate

1412
01:07:10,975 --> 01:07:11,487
But

1413
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:13,279
It certainly gives a more

1414
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:15,583
Timeline that what we've had so far

1415
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:19,679
Yeah he get he gives that caveat but it's very it's very off

1416
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:21,471
That's way off

1417
01:07:21,983 --> 01:07:23,519
Yes definitely

1418
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:27,103
You had him shooting at the school

1419
01:07:27,615 --> 01:07:28,383
Around

1420
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:30,175
1131

1421
01:07:30,431 --> 01:07:31,711
Now so you have that

1422
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:34,527
Which is not necessarily A

1423
01:07:34,783 --> 01:07:38,111
Exchanged gunfire

1424
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:41,951
So you can't you know that's right around right before he

1425
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:43,743
Entering the school

1426
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:48,607
The 11 minutes 14 minutes or whatever he's saying there that is

1427
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:50,911
That is very not accurate

1428
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:56,287
I wonder how that's possible I mean I'm guessing maybe

1429
01:07:57,055 --> 01:07:57,823
You know there's a

1430
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:01,407
Confluence of sources that he has maybe in summer

1431
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:06,015
That some have some information that the police are going to reveal and some of it is

1432
01:08:06,527 --> 01:08:07,807
Wildly off-base

1433
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:11,135
If I was going to speculate based upon this type of

1434
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:11,903
Mustang

1435
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:14,207
And what I know I would say that there's

1436
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:15,743
Is a good chance that he's got some

1437
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:16,511
Some friends who are into

1438
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:17,535
Texas law enforcement

1439
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:18,815
Yes but are not

1440
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:19,839
Specifically there

1441
01:08:20,351 --> 01:08:21,375
And they have friends

1442
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:22,143
Who were they

1443
01:08:22,655 --> 01:08:24,703
So maybe a little bit of a game of telephone exact

1444
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:26,239
That's possible

1445
01:08:26,495 --> 01:08:28,543
Yeah I don't know it's it's bizarre though

1446
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:31,615
Yeah it seems like this is a level of like

1447
01:08:31,871 --> 01:08:32,895
Secondhand information

1448
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:35,199
Instead of my buddies who are cops

1449
01:08:35,455 --> 01:08:38,271
In the system there said there's this is probably

1450
01:08:38,783 --> 01:08:41,599
And what kind of troubles me about this is that like

1451
01:08:41,855 --> 01:08:43,135
That directly contradicts

1452
01:08:43,391 --> 01:08:44,927
The stuff that Alex is saying about the hot

1453
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:46,719
Situation that went on an hour

1454
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:52,863
And so I never discussed the discrepancy in the information that they're putting forth

1455
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:54,399
Which I find

1456
01:08:54,911 --> 01:08:56,191
Hard to manage

1457
01:08:56,447 --> 01:08:56,959
Yeah

1458
01:08:59,007 --> 01:08:59,519
Call

1459
01:09:00,031 --> 01:09:02,847
But look I don't know why you yell cuz you can only keep one thought

1460
01:09:03,103 --> 01:09:05,151
Your head at the same time see that's the trick

1461
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:06,943
Don't think about it

1462
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:13,087
So Alex has a another thought about what we should do

1463
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:16,671
What about the symbol thing of a fence around the schools as you pointed out

1464
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:20,255
Portable Buildings in

1465
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:22,303
Trailers that put up that doesn't work

1466
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:29,471
The funds to build bar building or they don't have the space

1467
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:31,007
Whatever the case may be

1468
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:32,799
Because we gave them to the Capri.

1469
01:09:33,055 --> 01:09:33,823
Any barriers

1470
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:40,479
Yeah and you know what there should be barbed wire going in

1471
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:44,575
You know what no it makes perfect sense

1472
01:09:44,831 --> 01:09:46,879
The only way that schools would get

1473
01:09:47,135 --> 01:09:47,647
More money

1474
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:49,951
Is if it literally going to build a wall

1475
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:52,767
I mean it's just ridiculous

1476
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:54,815
This

1477
01:09:55,071 --> 01:09:55,839
At the same time I think

1478
01:09:56,863 --> 01:10:01,983
My school when I was growing up had a fence around it was like decorative

1479
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:05,311
Are you talking about is like some

1480
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:09,151
The containment Joliet prison

1481
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:10,687
I've been

1482
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:17,087
By their 100 times they are describing exactly what Joliet prison looks like cuz it's even got the red brick

1483
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:23,487
Look a little bit like a school with prisons you'll have overflow and trailer

1484
01:10:28,351 --> 01:10:32,447
So Alex takes a look at some of these shooters Pull-Ups

1485
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:35,263
Some pictures looking at them that there

1486
01:10:35,519 --> 01:10:36,287
They're psychotic

1487
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:37,823
Psychotic

1488
01:10:38,847 --> 01:10:41,919
What are the individuals that did that showing these are obvious psychotic

1489
01:10:42,687 --> 01:10:43,199
Yeah

1490
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:46,527
There were abuses in the in the mental institutions in the US No Doubt

1491
01:10:47,295 --> 01:10:49,599
One who flies Over the Cuckoo's Nest the 70s

1492
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:50,879
What

1493
01:10:51,391 --> 01:10:53,951
Exactly

1494
01:10:54,207 --> 01:10:57,023
Yeah we don't institutionalize other people anymore

1495
01:10:59,071 --> 01:11:00,095
One of the problems that were

1496
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:07,007
Wow I never would have thought someone like Alex would be so in favor of forced incarceration in Mental Hospitals for people to state.

1497
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:08,287
Beams inside

1498
01:11:08,543 --> 01:11:12,127
This is ridiculous because Alex doesn't believe in medicine he doesn't believe in

1499
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:17,759
Psychologist in the very idea of locking people up an asylum before they've committed any crimes isn't direct contradiction

1500
01:11:18,015 --> 01:11:19,551
Obvious beliefs about the Bill of Rights

1501
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:22,111
I also would caution him that based on his

1502
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:25,951
Public statements

1503
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:26,975
He might find himself

1504
01:11:27,231 --> 01:11:28,511
On the wrong end up getting it

1505
01:11:28,767 --> 01:11:29,279
Tatoosh analyzed

1506
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:31,327
If This Were common practice that we're to come back

1507
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:32,351
Oh yeah

1508
01:11:32,607 --> 01:11:34,399
There are still Mental Hospitals in the United

1509
01:11:34,655 --> 01:11:37,471
Midstates in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest didn't turn everyone against them

1510
01:11:37,983 --> 01:11:41,567
The rest of the world doesn't have all their opinions formed by moves

1511
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:44,383
The way that Alex does

1512
01:11:44,639 --> 01:11:47,199
Is true the issue is that most of the public

1513
01:11:47,455 --> 01:11:49,503
Funding for mental hospitals has disappeared

1514
01:11:49,759 --> 01:11:53,343
And private mental health hospitals often are covered by insurance plans

1515
01:11:53,599 --> 01:11:56,927
And Medicaid does not cover long-term mental health care

1516
01:11:57,183 --> 01:12:02,303
A large segment of the population has basically no access to these institutions in many people who would

1517
01:12:02,559 --> 01:12:03,327
Be helped by them

1518
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:04,607
End up in prison be

1519
01:12:04,863 --> 01:12:06,911
Because they don't have access to these things that made

1520
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:07,935
Prevent them

1521
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:08,703
From

1522
01:12:08,959 --> 01:12:10,239
Being in a situation where they were

1523
01:12:10,495 --> 01:12:11,263
Grimes delete them

1524
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:17,407
There were tonne of variables that go into the very sordid history of mental institutions and a lot of

1525
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:18,943
These transactions

1526
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:22,527
We're already in motion somewhat before Reagan slash

1527
01:12:22,783 --> 01:12:24,319
Fun date first aid centers

1528
01:12:24,575 --> 01:12:26,623
In his 1981 Omnibus budget reconciliation

1529
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:27,391
Reconciliation

1530
01:12:27,903 --> 01:12:30,975
Which is where a lot of people playing crimes it was a big blow

1531
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:31,999
Foursquare

1532
01:12:32,255 --> 01:12:34,559
But there were some friends already

1533
01:12:34,815 --> 01:12:40,703
It predated.

1534
01:12:42,495 --> 01:12:43,519
It's

1535
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:46,335
My opinion on it is like

1536
01:12:46,847 --> 01:12:49,407
It isn't the full story to blame Reagan but

1537
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:55,807
Why not yell at anyway not a good story to play Dragon

1538
01:12:56,063 --> 01:12:56,575
Can you fuc

1539
01:12:56,831 --> 01:13:00,415
Yeah but I'm not going to fight this one

1540
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:01,183
Chick-fil-A app

1541
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:07,583
But it's real enough that many people don't have access to the Mental Health Resources they need but the way Alex is talking about this

1542
01:13:07,839 --> 01:13:11,423
The stupid I need to point out a major point

1543
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:12,959
Of belief

1544
01:13:13,471 --> 01:13:14,239
Is that like

1545
01:13:14,495 --> 01:13:17,823
MK Ultra assassins were brainwashed in mental health

1546
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:21,407
I mean that people should be going to that

1547
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:27,807
Why is he Jolly in West tests on people Mental Hospitals whenever he's just saying

1548
01:13:29,855 --> 01:13:34,975
Legacies just saying like we should have a prison for prison people in a prison for people who are

1549
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:41,375
Crazy Irishman of Arkham Asylum galleries who haven't committed crimes

1550
01:13:41,631 --> 01:13:42,143
It's just like

1551
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:44,447
Lisa from down the street

1552
01:13:44,959 --> 01:13:45,471
Yeah

1553
01:13:45,727 --> 01:13:48,287
I tried to get a raise

1554
01:13:48,543 --> 01:13:51,871
No I'm here forever dinner in there get her in there

1555
01:13:52,639 --> 01:13:54,943
So I called demons

1556
01:13:59,295 --> 01:14:00,575
I mean look at them

1557
01:14:00,831 --> 01:14:03,391
And if you look in there

1558
01:14:05,183 --> 01:14:05,695
You would not

1559
01:14:11,839 --> 01:14:14,911
Proper assessment threat assessment of these individuals is some

1560
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:16,703
Something that is seriously lacking

1561
01:14:16,959 --> 01:14:18,751
They're suicidal drug addict

1562
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:19,519
Crazy people

1563
01:14:19,775 --> 01:14:20,287
Call Dan

1564
01:14:20,799 --> 01:14:21,311
Everytime shoot about

1565
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:28,223
Play military game

1566
01:14:28,479 --> 01:14:31,551
Oh it's the criminology it's a psychology

1567
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:34,111
Profile

1568
01:14:34,367 --> 01:14:37,439
I never seen profile so clear and clear-cut Tim

1569
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:40,255
The profile doesn't match

1570
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:41,279
People

1571
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:44,351
The only if it only matches because

1572
01:14:44,607 --> 01:14:47,423
He says the same things about every everything going

1573
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:50,239
Doesn't matter if they actually are

1574
01:14:50,495 --> 01:14:51,263
I would love

1575
01:14:51,519 --> 01:14:53,055
For him to try and demonstrate

1576
01:14:53,311 --> 01:14:56,383
Bike the the everyone's into devil worship

1577
01:14:58,175 --> 01:15:03,039
These things are only there only a rock-solid profile because

1578
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:04,575
The unerring

1579
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:05,599
Talking points

1580
01:15:06,623 --> 01:15:07,135
Infowars

1581
01:15:10,207 --> 01:15:11,999
F****** good profiler if

1582
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:18,655
You just live in a world where everything you say is right and you say the same thing every time

1583
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:19,679
It's a lot simpler

1584
01:15:20,959 --> 01:15:25,055
Menlo is got another idea here about

1585
01:15:25,311 --> 01:15:26,079
Good guys

1586
01:15:26,591 --> 01:15:28,639
Yeah who have gone no taken away

1587
01:15:28,895 --> 01:15:30,943
His ideas

1588
01:15:31,455 --> 01:15:35,039
Shootings on the slide ride

1589
01:15:35,295 --> 01:15:37,343
Who was armed a good guy was armed and pray

1590
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:38,879
Presents

1591
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:42,463
Right I just sent it to him and you know the most the most

1592
01:15:42,975 --> 01:15:43,487
People that were shot

1593
01:15:43,743 --> 01:15:45,023
In a situation like

1594
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:47,839
Now you go to where

1595
01:15:48,095 --> 01:15:50,143
There was no person

1596
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:53,983
And Luca

1597
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:57,055
Call 911

1598
01:15:58,079 --> 01:15:59,615
So you looking at 100

1599
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:04,991
And that's just one example ride like

1600
01:16:06,783 --> 01:16:08,063
Play called 911 it's 30

1601
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:09,855
34 people

1602
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:11,903
420 247

1603
01:16:12,415 --> 01:16:12,927
70

1604
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:13,951
28

1605
01:16:14,463 --> 01:16:14,975
31

1606
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:18,815
4640 346 again right

1607
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:26,751
The highest number is 9

1608
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:28,799
24

1609
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:32,895
521 + 1

1610
01:16:33,151 --> 01:16:34,943
It's like it it's just there's a huge to

1611
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:36,479
So

1612
01:16:36,735 --> 01:16:39,807
Again this is just dishonest discourse bye-bye than them

1613
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:43,135
Guns have

1614
01:16:43,647 --> 01:16:44,159
Continue to save

1615
01:16:44,927 --> 01:16:46,719
This is not how you would

1616
01:16:46,975 --> 01:16:48,767
Assess these kinds of things

1617
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:50,303
This is just sort of

1618
01:16:50,559 --> 01:16:53,631
Take it back I want I want him in there and it's

1619
01:16:53,887 --> 01:16:55,679
Got to be down deep in the dark

1620
01:16:55,935 --> 01:16:57,727
This Slide the Tim is just

1621
01:16:57,983 --> 01:16:58,495
Used it

1622
01:16:58,751 --> 01:17:00,543
It's by definition cherry-picks because

1623
01:17:00,799 --> 01:17:05,919
He says that the top one on the side of waiting for the police to respond to the Pulse Nightclub shooting but

1624
01:17:06,175 --> 01:17:08,991
There were way more people shot in the Las Vegas shooting

1625
01:17:09,247 --> 01:17:12,319
There are over 400 people injured by gunfire that day so like

1626
01:17:12,831 --> 01:17:14,111
Why is that not on there

1627
01:17:14,367 --> 01:17:20,511
Well cuz that makes it really look like if you have a gun and are able to even better if it's

1628
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:24,863
It's a good guy with a gun it's it's on the other side of the equation

1629
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:25,887
What you going to get a snack

1630
01:17:26,143 --> 01:17:29,983
Sniper to get up there maybe in the hotel I don't know

1631
01:17:31,007 --> 01:17:34,847
Tim has made seem really convincing to an audience that already believes

1632
01:17:35,103 --> 01:17:35,615
Conclusion but the

1633
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:37,407
The data doesn't back up what he selling

1634
01:17:38,175 --> 01:17:44,319
Instance of a good guy with a gun stopping a shooting you can fight an instance of someone not intervening or someone having

1635
01:17:44,575 --> 01:17:45,599
Argon used against them

1636
01:17:46,111 --> 01:17:51,487
On a very basic level the National Bureau of economic research released a study in 2017 that found that

1637
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:57,119
Carry laws are associated with 13 to 15 per cent higher aggregate violent crime rate

1638
01:17:57,375 --> 01:17:58,655
Ten Years After adoption

1639
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:00,191
Further

1640
01:18:00,447 --> 01:18:06,079
A 2013 study in the American Journal of Public Health reviewing data from 1981 to 2010

1641
01:18:06,335 --> 01:18:10,943
Found it for every percentage point the gun ownership increased in a certain area

1642
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:14,527
Firearm homicide rates increased by 9%

1643
01:18:15,295 --> 01:18:20,671
The good guy with a gun stuff is fun to fantasize about if you're someone like Timber Alex but in the real world it doesn't have the

1644
01:18:20,927 --> 01:18:21,695
Statistical back

1645
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:23,999
To be something you really want to seriously rely on

1646
01:18:24,767 --> 01:18:26,815
What's imagine a world where this ideology

1647
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:29,375
Get so popular that you end up having a shooting

1648
01:18:29,631 --> 01:18:31,679
There's not one guy with a good guy with a Gun there's

1649
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:33,215
10 good guys with a gun

1650
01:18:33,727 --> 01:18:38,335
It's probably going to be pretty difficult in the fog of that whole thing to know who's a shooter and who's a good guy with

1651
01:18:38,591 --> 01:18:41,663
It really chaotic if this was taken to its like

1652
01:18:41,919 --> 01:18:42,431
Logical

1653
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:43,199
Conclusion

1654
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:45,247
Anyways.

1655
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:50,879
Blows my my 1% each percentage point

1656
01:18:51,135 --> 01:18:54,207
Equals 9%

1657
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:56,511
Increase well we yes

1658
01:18:56,767 --> 01:18:57,791
But also

1659
01:18:58,303 --> 01:19:00,351
You'd have to factor in

1660
01:19:01,631 --> 01:19:02,399
It would be it wouldn't

1661
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:04,703
Like whatever the previous

1662
01:19:04,959 --> 01:19:08,287
Like violent crime rate or firearm homicide rate was

1663
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:13,919
We go up 5.9% of that

1664
01:19:14,175 --> 01:19:16,479
Right now I understand the crime was like 8

1665
01:19:16,735 --> 01:19:17,759
Percent

1666
01:19:18,015 --> 01:19:18,527
8 point

1667
01:19:22,623 --> 01:19:25,183
It's going up a whole percentage

1668
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:31,327
08 % that's very different from 8.8

1669
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:32,863
Percent increase

1670
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:35,167
So

1671
01:19:35,935 --> 01:19:40,287
We we talked about this a little bit throughout the show and that is this idea that Alex

1672
01:19:40,543 --> 01:19:41,567
He's like why is

1673
01:19:41,823 --> 01:19:42,591
He's so

1674
01:19:43,103 --> 01:19:45,919
Beholding to the police right Terry Witter

1675
01:19:46,431 --> 01:19:48,735
Can I take it was like flipping my articulate

1676
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:50,015
Exactly why

1677
01:19:51,039 --> 01:19:51,807
This is not a

1678
01:20:02,815 --> 01:20:05,631
Other places are good

1679
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:08,959
Who controls them

1680
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:14,080
Put the left with

1681
01:20:14,336 --> 01:20:16,640
That's why we can't just

1682
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:19,712
Knee-jerk reaction just go with the letters tattoo place

1683
01:20:19,968 --> 01:20:20,992
Brianna percent

1684
01:20:21,248 --> 01:20:25,600
I think that's a really sincere articulation of what Alex really thinks

1685
01:20:25,856 --> 01:20:28,672
At this point in his coverage is so much of it

1686
01:20:28,928 --> 01:20:30,208
Ass kissing exercise for the police

1687
01:20:30,976 --> 01:20:35,328
It is mine the globalist in the Patriots are fighting for control of the police

1688
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:37,632
The paramilitary group that holds the Monopoly

1689
01:20:37,888 --> 01:20:39,168
Only use of State Force

1690
01:20:39,424 --> 01:20:44,544
At this point the police are very much on Alex's team side as evidenced by their different

1691
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:45,824
The protesters a month

1692
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:46,592
Other things

1693
01:20:47,104 --> 01:20:48,896
Many other things any other thing

1694
01:20:49,152 --> 01:20:53,760
Alex knows that it's I can't possibly continue to get away with the s*** they get away with it

1695
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:54,784
The police stopped going

1696
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:56,064
Very easy on them

1697
01:20:56,576 --> 01:20:57,856
Head on sublevel

1698
01:20:58,112 --> 01:21:01,696
He thinks he can't be too critical of the police or they'll

1699
01:21:01,952 --> 01:21:03,232
Support the Patriots anymore

1700
01:21:03,744 --> 01:21:06,304
Elsa come to being federalized by the globalist

1701
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:08,608
So then it's game over for Alex and his buddy

1702
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:11,168
And then further I think Alex does have

1703
01:21:11,424 --> 01:21:11,936
Some

1704
01:21:12,448 --> 01:21:13,216
Ideas of

1705
01:21:13,472 --> 01:21:13,984
A pendant

1706
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:14,752
Collapse

1707
01:21:15,008 --> 01:21:15,776
And needing

1708
01:21:16,032 --> 01:21:17,312
Vevo

1709
01:21:17,568 --> 01:21:18,336
Please

1710
01:21:18,848 --> 01:21:20,128
For Sunday the arm

1711
01:21:21,152 --> 01:21:23,968
Essentially civilian Army to be

1712
01:21:24,224 --> 01:21:27,296
Basically on their side

1713
01:21:27,552 --> 01:21:30,112
I'm sorry I interrupted

1714
01:21:30,368 --> 01:21:31,136
I think he's afraid

1715
01:21:31,648 --> 01:21:37,792
Criticize the police so I think not even simpler but his argument

1716
01:21:38,048 --> 01:21:39,328
Is at the end of the day

1717
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:41,888
The police are just a fascist millet

1718
01:21:42,656 --> 01:21:44,448
So if the left has control of the fash

1719
01:21:44,704 --> 01:21:45,984
I took military it's going to happen to us

1720
01:21:46,752 --> 01:21:47,264
And if we have

1721
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:49,568
Control the fastest going to happen to them

1722
01:21:51,872 --> 01:21:52,384
Well

1723
01:21:52,896 --> 01:21:54,688
Sure but I think that was

1724
01:21:54,944 --> 01:21:55,456
Underneath

1725
01:21:55,712 --> 01:22:01,856
Why he's acting like he's acting is because he's afraid that reality

1726
01:22:02,112 --> 01:22:02,880
He doesn't want to love to have

1727
01:22:03,136 --> 01:22:05,184
Control over whether or not the cops are going to allow him to

1728
01:22:09,024 --> 01:22:15,168
So yeah I think that kind of might be an indication of what's going on here although it's still soup

1729
01:22:15,424 --> 01:22:15,936
Super weird

1730
01:22:16,448 --> 01:22:17,728
They could still just so much

1731
01:22:17,984 --> 01:22:19,520
It's like out of line with

1732
01:22:19,776 --> 01:22:21,824
Really core tenants of Alex's

1733
01:22:22,592 --> 01:22:23,360
No

1734
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:24,128
No no

1735
01:22:24,384 --> 01:22:25,920
No no no I know

1736
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:29,760
I don't mean like I'm questioning you I mean like I don't know

1737
01:22:31,552 --> 01:22:37,696
Hi there it seemed there feels like there's there's something a little bit deeper in might just be a weird day for him into being deferential

1738
01:22:37,952 --> 01:22:38,720
Menlo

1739
01:22:38,976 --> 01:22:42,048
Like that shirt had honestly could explain a whole lot

1740
01:22:42,304 --> 01:22:45,632
Mixed in with this fear of of being critical of the police

1741
01:22:45,888 --> 01:22:47,168
I mean at the same time

1742
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:50,496
Weird day to go from your daughter's graduation

1743
01:22:50,752 --> 01:22:51,520
At kindergarten

1744
01:22:51,776 --> 01:22:54,592
To immediately talk to a mercenary

1745
01:22:54,848 --> 01:22:56,640
Weird day

1746
01:22:57,152 --> 01:22:57,920
Whiplash

1747
01:22:58,176 --> 01:23:00,992
What I'm talking about Alex like just like these things are

1748
01:23:01,504 --> 01:23:03,296
Contrary to things that are

1749
01:23:03,552 --> 01:23:06,112
Deeply-held like core Infowars s***

1750
01:23:06,624 --> 01:23:07,136
Like this is one of

1751
01:23:08,672 --> 01:23:09,696
So we need

1752
01:23:11,488 --> 01:23:12,000
Equipment

1753
01:23:12,512 --> 01:23:14,816
And we need more and more drills at

1754
01:23:15,072 --> 01:23:15,584
Keysschools

1755
01:23:16,352 --> 01:23:16,864
Prepare for

1756
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:20,704
NeverEnding Abby

1757
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:22,752
It's always change

1758
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:24,800
Dislike

1759
01:23:25,056 --> 01:23:27,104
Is something that Alex should never be supported

1760
01:23:27,616 --> 01:23:30,176
NeverEnding Mass shooter drills at schools

1761
01:23:30,688 --> 01:23:32,992
This is right in line with

1762
01:23:33,248 --> 01:23:37,344
His auntie police state ideology right there

1763
01:23:37,856 --> 01:23:41,184
That's insane this is almost coming off like a prank quite frankly because

1764
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:45,280
This seems so disconnected from what supposed to be the bigger picture of what Alex is about

1765
01:23:46,816 --> 01:23:51,680
He believes these shooter drills traumatize children that are meant to train them to live in a police state where they have to

1766
01:23:51,936 --> 01:23:53,472
To comply with the orders of armed men

1767
01:23:53,984 --> 01:24:00,128
Arm shooter drills are meant to prepare the Next Generation to leaving tyranny and to train them to be afraid of guns

1768
01:24:00,384 --> 01:24:01,152
Which is why the globalist

1769
01:24:01,408 --> 01:24:01,920
Do them

1770
01:24:02,176 --> 01:24:08,320
And the girls themselves are usually also the false flag right that's actually believes that if

1771
01:24:08,576 --> 01:24:09,088
To run a drill

1772
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:12,160
How to prepare for something you're secretly about to do it yourself

1773
01:24:12,672 --> 01:24:17,024
There are countless examples of disaster preparation drills or anti-terrorism drills that Alex's

1774
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:18,816
Sister we're just cover for the globalist

1775
01:24:19,328 --> 01:24:20,352
To do the real thing

1776
01:24:20,608 --> 01:24:23,680
You should hate the idea of widespread never-ending shooter drills

1777
01:24:23,936 --> 01:24:24,448
Only because

1778
01:24:24,704 --> 01:24:26,496
He should think that would give a globalist

1779
01:24:26,752 --> 01:24:28,288
Unlimited opportunities

1780
01:24:28,544 --> 01:24:34,688
Cloak their french fries and a drill

1781
01:24:34,944 --> 01:24:40,832
Yeah we got to change I'm sorry for his game

1782
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:41,600
It is

1783
01:24:41,856 --> 01:24:42,624
It is like

1784
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:44,672
When the chips are down for guns

1785
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:48,256
They are willing to sacrifice every other part of America

1786
01:24:49,792 --> 01:24:51,072
Yep that I think it's important

1787
01:24:51,328 --> 01:24:52,608
Probably

1788
01:24:53,632 --> 01:24:55,424
A way to still love guns

1789
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:56,960
Not be this

1790
01:24:57,984 --> 01:24:59,008
You think it would be that hard

1791
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:00,544
A lot of people do it

1792
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:03,872
I would even say the majority of people who own guns

1793
01:25:04,384 --> 01:25:04,896
I like

1794
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:06,688
Let's not kill people

1795
01:25:08,224 --> 01:25:08,992
I'm leaving to go that far

1796
01:25:09,248 --> 01:25:09,760
Probably

1797
01:25:12,064 --> 01:25:12,576
Yep

1798
01:25:12,832 --> 01:25:13,600
And

1799
01:25:15,136 --> 01:25:16,160
Alex's

1800
01:25:16,928 --> 01:25:17,440
You got news.

1801
01:25:19,488 --> 01:25:20,000
But he's not going

1802
01:25:20,512 --> 01:25:21,024
Oh that's

1803
01:25:23,072 --> 01:25:25,120
Snooze to cover in the meantime

1804
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:28,192
Take our

1806
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:32,544
I want you to know

1807
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:33,312
But job

1808
01:25:35,616 --> 01:25:36,640
Here's the bottom line

1809

Newtonian physics show us what

1810
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:40,736
Stop

1811
01:25:43,808 --> 01:25:44,320
Stop

1812

We don't need the

We know it why that for every action there's an opposite Ray

Video that I forgot the play

1830
01:26:55,744 --> 01:26:56,256
Wow

1831
01:26:56,768 --> 01:26:59,072
Just wow

1832
01:26:59,328 --> 01:27:02,912
I am I hit a piece of information from you

1833
01:27:03,168 --> 01:27:03,680
Tween

1834
01:27:03,936 --> 01:27:08,032
The Tim in Lowe interview and they clip that I just played for you was a full segment

1835
01:27:08,544 --> 01:27:11,360
Of Alex promoting that coin the f*** out of here

1836
01:27:11,872 --> 01:27:12,896
You son of a b****

1837
01:27:13,408 --> 01:27:13,920
For like

1838
01:27:14,176 --> 01:27:19,296
7 minutes about the coin

1839
01:27:19,552 --> 01:27:21,344
I didn't have the time to get to it

1840
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:26,208
And I can't get to the news cuz I have the ring of Mordor and

1841
01:27:28,256 --> 01:27:34,144
Having the ring apart of the the point is that the Ring of order will turn you evil rub to me

1842
01:27:36,448 --> 01:27:42,592
That is not cuz he's not a nerve like that nerd

1843
01:27:43,104 --> 01:27:44,384
Yeah it's a little frustrated

1844
01:27:44,896 --> 01:27:48,992
Yeah we come to the end of this I think that this is developing very weird

1845
01:27:50,272 --> 01:27:51,552
Yeah

1846
01:27:52,832 --> 01:27:53,344
Flicted

1847
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:54,368
A little bit

1848
01:27:54,624 --> 01:27:56,672
Because I do think there's still an interesting

1849
01:27:56,928 --> 01:27:57,440
Path

1850
01:27:57,696 --> 01:27:58,464
Let's

1851
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:00,000
Been going down

1852
01:28:00,256 --> 01:28:06,400
But I worried that I myself am not really enjoying dwelling on this subject

1853
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:08,448
Jack matter as much as I am

1854
01:28:09,472 --> 01:28:13,056
And I wonder if the experienced a similar for the audio

1855
01:28:13,568 --> 01:28:14,848
So I don't know if

1856
01:28:15,616 --> 01:28:17,664
I'm not entirely sure if

1857
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:18,944
For the next episode will

1858
01:28:19,456 --> 01:28:21,760
Continue down this path or maybe have some

1859
01:28:22,016 --> 01:28:22,784
Something to switch it up

1860
01:28:23,296 --> 01:28:24,064
I-22

1861
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:28,416
Mix it up a little bit

1862
01:28:28,928 --> 01:28:32,256
I am all over the place

1863
01:28:32,512 --> 01:28:33,536
Scout and you ground

01:28:34,048 --> 01:28:34,560
With

1865
01:28:34,816 --> 01:28:36,352
Solid factual information

1866
01:28:36,864 --> 01:28:39,680
And we do not have as much of that as is

1867
01:28:39,936 --> 01:28:42,240
Usually the case so I feel like I'm

1868
01:28:42,496 --> 01:28:43,008
Flying

1869
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:44,032
Solo

1870
01:28:44,288 --> 01:28:44,800
You know what I'm saying

1871
01:28:45,056 --> 01:28:49,664
Yeah yeah part it's hard to it's hard to clean to

1872
01:28:50,176 --> 01:28:52,992
We'll see how it feels

1873
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:58,112
Whether you like it or not

1874
01:28:58,368 --> 01:29:04,512
