00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:52,351
I'll probably be bored

00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:22,463

I know what that is

97
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:39,423
I'm not saying it I don't know how to say it I've only ever

98
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:52,223
Appreciate it

99
00:08:55,039 --> 00:09:01,183

00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:27,551
Before the episode

104
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:35,487
This is a little something that is from Purple Penguin

105
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:42,143
Jordan look at that look at that piece of art

106
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,751

And the Vatican has finally accepted that I am that Messiah

110
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:14,143
Because I showed them the codes that were inside the Vatican

111
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,703
That only the real Jesus would have

112
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,983
Don't ever forget that

113
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,263
Don't betray me

114
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:25,663

119
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:02,527

120
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:04,575
Literally in a possibility

121
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:08,927
Anyone could find a flyer for like is

00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:12,255
80s radio

123
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:18,655
Okay, I will pay even more than that

124
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,935
No

125
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:30,687

133
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:04,479
The second reason was there's a lot of nonsense happening first of all

134
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:05,503
Before the 20th

135
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,783
The night before

136
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:10,367
We had the reporter asks Trump about qanon

137
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,903
And that was weird

138
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:19,583
They love me I've never heard about there.

139
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,399
Slowly

140
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:27,007
So I felt like there was a lot of potential for

141
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,055
Takes

142
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:33,407
Started

143
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:35,199
Alex started the show

144
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:39,039
No it was not the Andy Griffith Show

145
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:41,343
The show starts with Alex

146
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,903
Of the reporter

147
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:46,207
Talking or asking Trump

148
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:50,047
About qanon

149
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,327
It's missing from this

150
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:56,703

Find

154
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:07,199
Haven't heard that.

155
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:15,647
If I can help

156
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:18,975
I'm willing to put myself out there

157
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:23,071
We're saving the world from a radical left

158
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,607
Philosophy

159
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:27,679

161
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,775
The rest of the world would follow

162
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:38,431
Every time that Alex plays number

163
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:44,831
The beginning where she's asking about you and I

164
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:52,767
S*** on this because he also says that Trump is fighting a Caballo

165
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:53,535
Cannibalistic

166
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,559
Pedophiles

Network

168
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:03,519
Nick should on that he has stated position the qanon debunked assholes

169
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:06,591
Do you have to take the Optics of this

170
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:11,967
I'm just remove the part where the questions about you and

171
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:12,991
Perfect sense

172
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:13,759
From his

173
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:16,575
Nice

174
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:22,975
Trump is fighting demons

175
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:24,255
I've never met Millie Weaver

176
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:27,071
Interesting Lee Alex does

177
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:30,399
Start the show

178
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:38,079
And I thought that he was going to get into it because he says he's not going to get into it

179
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:42,175
Credit impeachable

180
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,479
It was true

181
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:50,623
The medium is the issue

182
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,903
They said everybody up to

183
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:52,671
Copper something

184
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,207
But it wasn't

185
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:57,023
That was happening

186
00:14:57,535 --> 00:15:00,095

You're going to have

194
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:49,759
So

195
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:52,063
And

196
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:58,719
Whatever he says I can't today or not

197
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:11,519
The central point of my curiosity

198
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:13,567
What was going to happen

199
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:15,615
Coming out the gate

200
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:18,431
Touching on these topics that I want to hear about

201
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:20,991
It's pretty interesting

202
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,039
Stephen Manning was arrested

203
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:27,647
Southern district of New York

204
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:37,887
Border wall

205
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,191
The millions of dollars

206
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,799
Thousand-piece

207
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:57,087
Even interesting taste

208
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,111
What what

209
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:04,767
I can't see Bethel now I just can't embezzle she ate that on some level that Alex's position on it

210
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:16,287
Seems like we haven't had a real

211
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,823
Stop people from stealing

212
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:24,223
And then of course the old standard the fail-safes at the end there is the

213
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:32,159
Whatever

214
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:38,559
They're one of his videos or one of his co-workers like well of course they expect you to steal that's why they pay you so low

215
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:40,863
No

216
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:43,679
Stealing is wrong all the time

217
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:44,959
Route

218
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:48,799
This is

219
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:50,335
Evolves

220
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:56,735
A little bit okay and now talks about it a little bit more

221
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:57,759
Baby

222
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:01,599
There's something up with the Stanton arrest

223
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,951
Obama speech right before Biden

224
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:08,511
Credible

225
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,215
Scandal

226
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:22,079
Bannon is so slippery in

227
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:27,455
That he might be in on this

228
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,207
Wichita

229
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:44,607
Asinine

230
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:52,031
This is a false flag

231
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,823
He committed fraud

232
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:57,919
Got away with it for a long time

233
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:04,319
What was you thinking like what took you guys so long like now

234
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:09,183
From the jump in order to get this arrest eventually

235
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:18,911
Someone just you know

236
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:25,567
Like when you put your head down and you just wave your arms around and watch it's the windmill

237
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:26,335
Yeah

238
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:32,479
Fighting Spirit College spirit and Alex

239
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:37,087
Impotent

240
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:42,463
So I guess the sex clip we find out

241
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,231
In his

242
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:44,767
Fear of

243
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:50,143
Love the future obviously you've talked about preparing his bunker

244
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:52,703
And maybe somewhere outside

245
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,263
Austin or something

246
00:19:55,775 --> 00:20:01,919
You certainly don't allow disease

247
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:02,687
Food people

248
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:04,735
The new pinnacle

249
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:18,559
Prescription

250
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,679
In the medicine cabinet

251
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:25,983
Little Things

252
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:28,287
Antibiotics

253
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:42,879
Antibiotics

254
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:50,815
Okay

255
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,399
Yeah

256
00:20:56,703 --> 00:21:02,847
Yeah sure look toward antibiotic I don't know what to do with that I don't either Will Smith

257
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:09,247
Very real

258
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:12,831
Yeah I mean I don't know

259
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:17,696
I feel like you could probably end up causing more harm

260
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:24,096
Then then good expired antibiotics or if you don't have enough for a full

261
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:27,936
Cycle giving yourself a drug-resistant form of something

262
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:32,288
You could end up like that outside of doctor's supervision

263
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:34,592
Taking medications is usually

264
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:38,176
Antibiotics is one of them

265
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:40,224
His Back-up Plan

266
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,832
For when the operation with his supplements goes down

267
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:51,232
Talking expired antibiotics in the Apocalypse

268
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:58,912
Overdue but

269
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:01,216
Where you going to get better to do

270
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:05,824
Slidell

271
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:11,456
So Alex really trying to cover this to a non question those opposed

272
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:14,016
Trump without really

273
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:18,112
Having to own the fact that it was about qanon

274
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,352
Allstate Insurance

275
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:33,984
The question was about the human

276
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:38,080
He don't like Alex doesn't like completely

277
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:40,384
Deny

278
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:41,408
Mention

279
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:48,064
To cover everything surrounding

280
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:54,208
Much longer in the show

281
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:56,768
Yeah he's almost trying to discredit

282
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:58,816
The Conspiracy Theory with

283
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:00,864
Conspiracy theory

284
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,192
About how there isn't a conspiracy theory

285
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:05,984
But there is a conspiracy

286
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,520
Something like that

287
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:11,872
So Alex plays this clip from MSNBC

288
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:12,640
About

289
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:19,040
And

290
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:22,624
This is interesting of one of my favorite things about

291
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,392
This show

292
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:25,184
Alex's show

293
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:31,584
Is the various ways in which Tech goes wrong

294
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,656
Phone call Problem by problem

295
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:35,936
Just says

296
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:41,056
Hello yeah certain times with people can't find things that Alex needs

297
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:47,968
This is a new

298
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:49,504
Into this is from

299
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,880
More well-suited

300
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:01,024
Police

301
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,912
Terranean way down underworld

302
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:12,544
Around

303
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:14,336
How do you say

304
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,200
He has

305
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:20,736
Congratulated a right-wing

306
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:22,784
He is

307
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,576
Go commit now

308
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,904
Fringilla

309
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,464
I don't see how

310
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:34,048
That they're willing to roll the dice

311
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:36,864
Jason Brooks

312
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,288
Willis information

313
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:49,152
Bookstore

314
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:58,112
Music

315
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,168
That was not going out to break

316
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:15,776
That was just middle of this Sacred Music

317
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:17,056
Is work

318
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:21,664
For us that's the only thing that makes it would just start playing music

319
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:31,136
Or something like that

320
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:38,816
Accidentally was on a radio station or something

321
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:43,936
I just

322
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:44,960
Today's eclipse

323
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:51,104
It's remarkable that you've been new sign up your professionalism presentation

324
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,128
I'm waiting

325
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,920
Somebody has to throw a pie

326
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:55,968
That's what needs to happen

327
00:25:56,224 --> 00:26:02,368
That's what I bet the close your eyes preferably another publicity side with

328
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:08,768
Should be Millie Weaver absolutely

329
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:13,120
Disgustingly

330
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:16,448
California

331
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,824

00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,152
Come here and want to be us no no no

333
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:34,880

You not in Brisa

335
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:46,912
Reminder

336
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:52,032
When he's talking about normal

337
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,872
He's not having a conversation that specifically about people

338
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:57,408
With extreme ideology

339
00:26:57,664 --> 00:27:00,736
Of whatever orientation

340
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:09,184
Yeah he's talking about just an average Muslim

341
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:14,048
Stop trying to pretend

342
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:17,120
Stop trying to pretend that you're having a different conversation

343
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:23,520
You just generally hate other groups of people no matter what no one has any in

344
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:29,920
Interest in assimilating into into American culture at Large

345
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:36,320
Their culture upon other people because he

346
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:42,464
Pull up and force his ideas upon everyone else speaking of people blow things up

347
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:44,768
Particularly

348
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:46,304
Government

349
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:47,584
If you believe

350
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:50,400
Alex

351
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:57,312
Is going to be on today

352
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:09,088
Call Auntie Mary

353
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:14,208
It is

354
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:25,216
It's already out there

355
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:26,240
Dentist

356
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:38,784
Why did the Senate committee

357
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,320
Intelligence

358
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,088
Said that.

359
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,112
Stone

360
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:48,256
Need

361
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:50,816
Show trial in

362
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:53,632
Rodger stone with judge

363
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:54,912
Jackson

364
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:05,408
Trial

365
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:15,136
Trial he claimed the opposite Nordic Jam Rodger up

366
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:15,904
Surprise

367
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:21,792
Unfortunately the Senate intelligence committee's report was released last week and you can sell page 241

368
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:29,472
Call discussing Wikileaks on a songs with stone both before and after taking over as the chief exec

369
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:34,080
Trump campaign on August 13th 2016

370
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:40,736
We called the prior to joining the campaign

371
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:43,552
Inside information about WikiLeaks

372
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:50,208
After the role of campaign ceo-7 repeated to him that he had a relationship with Assange and said that

373
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:52,512
Wikileaks additional materials

374
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:54,304
That would be bad for the Trump campaign

375
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,584
That sure sounds like a

376
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,352
Crime

377
00:29:56,864 --> 00:30:00,704
Alex's promises false Rogers

378
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:08,128
He's banking on his audience without taking the time to learn what the Senate report says

379
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:10,944
Which is a safe

380
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:13,760
It's very long very long

381
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:15,040
So Steve

382
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:21,440
Amazon

383
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:23,488
For the sake of clarity

384
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,024
So Steve comes

385
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,584
And

386
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,864
When he swings

387
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,936
He swings for the goddamn Spencer's

388
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:33,728
Lili when's it was without

389
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:37,568
Anybody who's really going for it

390
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:43,968
You know I hate people in a girl monsters and they all have nefarious agenda

391
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:46,016
Taken as read

392
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:49,600
Classes of criminal here

393
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:52,928
And there's people who are like just really

394
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:59,328
Embarrassing

395
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:04,192
Give the ship Millie Weaver's terrible

396
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:10,080
Troyer's terrible

397
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:11,360
Dismissible

398
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,736
Steve is another class of criminals

399
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:19,552
I think part of it comes down to brazenness

400
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:25,952
Steve doesn't give a s*** f****** s*** does not care until your mother

401
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:30,560
That is Steve just like

402
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:32,352
You don't like it I don't

403
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:38,752
From the perspective of someone who has to listen to these ding dong talk all the time

404
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:40,544
Sort of entertainment

405
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,592
And particularly when he comes in

406
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:45,664
And this is his complaint about Bana

407
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,944
What is your take on this

408
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:51,552
I was show couple months ago

409
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:52,832
And I said that

410
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:54,624
Steve Bannon

411
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,160
Complete

412
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,816
And his delusions

413
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:08,704
Conviction and prison

414
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,472
Or

415
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:11,520
The reason is

416
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:12,288
Free sample

417
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:15,104
Shannon is what we call a self

418
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:15,872
Automotive

419
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:20,224
A nicer term

420
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,832
Oh really oh really

421
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:31,232
That's why he should be in prison

422
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:39,424
Now coming from the guy who's called from it solves every geopolitical problem because ever happen

423
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:45,824
Coronavirus yeah

424
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:57,088
There's something so Universal about mentality of like whatever they're accusing us of

425
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:04,256
And I think that everybody has a little degree in this Infowars world

426
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:05,280
But

427
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:07,328
Steve f******

428
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:13,728
Relishes swallows

429
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:15,264
Save it

430
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,080
Tom Clancy base Jack Ryan

431
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:24,224
It's just

432
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:30,624
It's just delicious. Projection is amazing he's covered in someone's blood that he just murdered

433
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,648
And he's like

434
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:36,512
I don't like Steve Bannon

435
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:38,048
It's amazing

436
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:44,448
Terminator time with Stampy

437
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:47,776
Well by his logic

438
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:51,360
Steve months ago

439
00:33:53,920 --> 00:34:00,064
Yeah well I mean that was a safe bet that might down for this but I want you to follow how excited Alex gets when he thinks that this was

440
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,600
Based on inside information

441
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:03,392
And how disappointing it is

442
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:04,928
When is the size of talkingshit

443
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,280
The arrest

444
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:14,144
How do you do the say that I should have started

445
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:16,192
Rumblings of this

446
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:18,752
No

447
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:19,520
No

448
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:22,848
You and I

449
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:24,128
Intuitively

450
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:30,016
Sure

451
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:35,392
So that was great

452
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:41,792
I don't know where in over his head

453
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:45,632
I didn't like him I don't

454
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:46,400
Yep

455
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:51,520
So a little bit about Obama and

456
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:57,664
Playing this is just as a way to point out that Alex is back

457
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,712
Pretty deeply in the

458
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:01,248
Calling Michelle Mike

459
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:06,880
That's a pretty disgusting

460
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:12,512
CIA

461
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:15,840
Homosexual

462
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:17,120
Complete farce

463
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:24,800
You know delivers Michelle Obama a total nobody

464
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:26,592
Already

465
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:29,920
French

466
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,392
TJ

467
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:40,928
Asexual

468
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:43,232
Individual

469
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:47,328
America

470
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:56,288
This is just such a stupid game but Alex is getting deep into it again and over and over again

471
00:35:56,544 --> 00:36:00,640
And it's really not worth getting riled up about

472
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:04,992
Ugly and you know

473
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:06,784
He is just trolling

474
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,624
He's really just trying to get a reaction out of people

475
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:16,256
Because we like we've seen this happen in Cycles before we're totally

476
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:19,328
And then whenever there's too much heat about it

477
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:22,912
He'll be like we were just joking you know obviously

478
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:25,728
This isn't something that we're serious about

479
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:32,128
Play it very seriously like I absolutely mean this is attention-seeking

480
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:33,152
Absolutely

481
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:37,760
I I was I would leave it alone entirely except for its becoming

482
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:40,064
Pretty frequent

483
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:41,856
And so I just

484
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:48,000
Wanted to say

485
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:53,888
So idea that you know

486
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:56,704
What's going to happen is that

487
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,472
Going to happen

488
00:36:57,984 --> 00:37:01,824
And then Trump going to win but then Pelosi and

489
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:03,360
Democrat

490
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:09,248
Or surgeon and they're going to secede

491
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:12,064
100%

492
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,208
Every one of the Punisher

493
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:19,488
Jones

494
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:20,768
Does Senator Schumer

495
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:29,984
Normalizing it we're going to secede

496
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:35,616
.

497
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,320
Claim

498
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:48,672
What

499
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:53,792
No s***

500
00:37:56,608 --> 00:38:02,752
Shut up let me start off by saying that your premise is ridiculous

501
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:06,336
Abigail

502
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:10,944
You're still a big dumb dumb Alex let me begin

503
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:17,344
Working for the last month

504
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:20,928
Stupid

505
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:26,560
Never happened it's nonsensical does not need to be afraid of that

506
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:30,912
I love whatever he's so dismissive

507
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:35,008
Just take an Alex point of view just go

508
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:36,544
Stop it get out

509
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:44,224
Blue in the background

510
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:48,576
Alex Azar

511
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:50,112
I mean that would be disrespect

512
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:51,904
Certainly

513
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:56,000
Disrespectful

514
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:57,792
Like whatever Alex

515
00:38:58,048 --> 00:39:01,632
Talks about his ideas and his Notions about America and

516
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:02,400
Freedom

517
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:08,288
Usually there's a presentation of romanticizing ideal

518
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:11,104
When Steve comes on

519
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,128
If it comes

520
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:13,408
Pretty queer

521
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:15,712
He doesn't share the same ideas

522
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:22,112
About America

523
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:32,096
And the reason for that is

524
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,984
Business people to understand

525
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,336
And one simple religion

526
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:48,480
Cereal

527
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:49,504
Angel

528
00:39:55,904 --> 00:40:02,048
Steve believes that the only religion the only thing that this country is based on

529
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:02,816
Capitalism

530
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:08,448
When was that

531
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,240
Right I mean boy

532
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:12,288
Loverboy

533
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:16,128
We are sick

534
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:18,432
I'm not being cereal capitalist

535
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:22,528
Away with you

536
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:29,184
Different view of America that

537
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:34,304
A different view of it

538
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,864
And the way he sees things

539
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:42,752
I think that he's done it already his audience of the series be serviced by you selling them

540
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:45,056
Romantic notion

541
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:55,552
Why even talk to me about the

542
00:40:55,808 --> 00:41:01,440
The Constitution or the Bill of Rights or the Declarations are all

543
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:07,072
Don't you just don't bother with

544
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:08,096
Yeah

545
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:10,912
That's it it's not in there

546
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:17,312
Just you just say to me you don't give a s*** about them

547
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:21,664
It meant protecting Kappa

548
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:23,968
Is

549
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:24,992
Certain

550
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:31,904
So are we from Steve's interview

551
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,440
Seems like a really big brag

552
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:36,000
And I don't think it's accurate

553
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:39,328
But it might be less far off then we want it

554
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:47,264
Jonestown

555
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:53,407
And we have to leave United States

556
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:55,711
And that's where the Democratic

557
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:58,783
Party is going there in the process

558
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:03,903
Involved in Johnstown

559
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:11,583
He was Jim Jones third in command

560
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:14,399
A meeting for way

561
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:18,239
You are your ancestors

562
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:27,199
Timeline of the undersecretary assistant secretary

563
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:32,575
State Department for management

564
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:36,927
Right I could see him being aware of

565
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:39,999
Situation in Georgetown

566
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:46,399
I don't know if you had any major role to play in it

567
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:47,423
Something along those

568
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:55,103
And whenever I expect that briefing to my Superior

569
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:58,687
Obviously I didn't lose things and change the course of human events

570
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:05,087
Yeah I could see him in that role is like Deputy assistant secretary

571
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:11,487
Something about what was going on and then learning

572
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:16,095
Steve

573
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:20,703
Either one

574
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:26,591
And I we get our visit from Deanna Lorraine

575
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:29,919
I'm like really ambitious bull

576
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:36,063
Dickhole what is real is not real what's real is

577
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:37,599
What's not real

578
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:39,903
Deanna Lorraine

579
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:42,463
This is such a shift in tone

580
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:43,487
Antabuse

581
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:44,511
So much

582
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:48,863
Like this dude

583
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:50,143
Amen

584
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:51,423
And then we go to this

585
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:58,591
Yesterday I'm not a nice hotel this isn't like a cheap hotel

586
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:02,943
Another world

587
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:04,991
It's a good one but it's a nice hotel

588
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:07,295
And Stan

589
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:09,343
I just went to the restaurant I want to ask

590
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:10,879
Ask the hostess a question

591
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:14,207
I said you know the restaurant know what time does the restaurant close

592
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:15,999
And naturally as I'm

593
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:20,351
I just pulled my math down a little bit to talk to her because otherwise that's so muscle

594
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:26,239
I said

595
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:29,567
You could just say Hi how are you are you could be nice about it

596
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:31,359
But you don't have to scream at me

597
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:35,455
And again as I'm saying you don't have to scream at me about it in a nice way

598
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:39,039
She screams at me again put your mask over your nose put your mask over nose

599
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:41,855
I can't do this anymore

600
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:43,903
At least during this pandemic

601
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:46,719
I'm already wearing my mask it's already too humanizing

602
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:50,303
You can at least be nice what happened to customer service

603
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:54,143
During the pandemic

604
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:57,215
Alright you and Alex and then I

605
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:59,775
Could really help myself I did flip her off

606
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:01,311
As I'm walking away

607
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:03,359
And I said I'm going to file a complaint about you

608
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:04,639
I can't

609
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:05,407
Yeah you should

610
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:07,711
Jasmine

611
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:11,551
Just wow customer service wow

612
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:12,319
John

613
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:14,111
You know

614
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:17,695
I do like the glow but I like the globe-trotting

615
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:24,095
I do I like the idea of Steve pieczenik be everywhere the Forrest Gump all.

616
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:25,375
And his swing

617
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:28,447
She's like what happened to basic

618
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:34,591
Beeson place that's it's minuscule it's very personal

619
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:37,407
A boring story

620
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:40,223
It's shooting on people who are

621
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:43,807
Having to go to work in an ideal conditions

622
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:48,927
It's it's Anna is unable to take of you outside herself at all

623
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:50,719
To what these people might be going

624
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:52,255
Through and it's just

625
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:54,815
It's not it's not worthwhile

626
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:55,583
It's

627
00:45:56,095 --> 00:46:00,191
Even if the stories 100% true she sounds like an a******

628
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:03,007
Nothing about this is

629
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:04,031
Heady

630
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:09,407
Culture War type nonsense it doesn't rise to the level of being interesting

631
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:15,807
This servant that his risking her life for minimum wage is not treating me

632
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:17,599
I would appreciate

633
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:21,439
I am going to scream at her and flip the bird

634
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:27,071
Yeah maybe

635
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:30,143
So anyway from the 20th

636
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:35,007
About how she was on the TV in Australia

637
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:38,335
Which we know about yes we were there

638
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:42,175
Oh a scalar attack

639
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:48,319
I was on the Australian News Today Show

640
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:51,903
As soon as I started getting into the real death numbers and

641
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:55,487
Zoomdekho no yeah they cut me off and they said it was a bad

642
00:46:55,743 --> 00:47:01,887
I'd be the president

643
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:02,655
Samples

644
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:03,935
Dressing a goat

645
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:05,215
Testing a paw paw

646
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:11,103
You can't make this stuff up but you can they're making it up and yet the siop continue

647
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:13,919
You know what it's really funny how

648
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:18,783
First Skype

649
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:21,599
I don't think they caught her. I think it's her Skype

650
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:27,999
Now and then now she's in the studio and Alex is helping her pretend that they cut her

651
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:30,815
IPhone

652
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:32,607
I don't think she'll listen to the rest

653
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:37,215
Galaxy

654
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:39,775
God

655
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:47,199
I was saying a bunch of nonsense and then my Skype which I prove never happened

656
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:53,599
My Skype feed cut out with you Alex the person I'm talking to right now obviously it's supposed to tip

657
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:55,647
Dangerous

658
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:59,487
An in-your-face terrible

659
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:03,071
Alex Jones

660
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:09,471
Now I'm in studio

661
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:11,007
Years ago

662
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:14,079
He's ruler shelter

663
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:15,615
So we get to the 21st

664
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:18,431
And Alex Wilkinson show and just like

665
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:19,967
This is this is where we're at

666
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:23,551
Show the new ads

667
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:24,831
PrimeWay

668
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:31,487
Playing Trump produced

669
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:33,535
Trump produced as

670
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:34,303
Yeah

671
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:35,583
No charge

672
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:39,167
I would assume so

673
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:45,567
I don't know I don't I don't complain if you're not being paid

674
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:51,967
Probably because like nothing, I don't know I don't know how I feel like

675
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:55,807
I don't know if it's wrong

676
00:48:56,063 --> 00:49:00,159
It puts you in a box

677
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:07,071
Because Alex gets a new Call of Duty commercial

678
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:11,679
Or why not

679
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:18,079
Cold war game that's coming out

680
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:21,663
Soviet KGB Defector

681
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:25,503
And Alex's pretending

682
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:30,111
At the storyline of the game is reality and it's very weird

683
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:36,511
Expect that come back I want you to video games are also

684
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:42,911
Predictive programming

685
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:53,151
Predictive programing alright that's a real surprise

686
00:49:56,479 --> 00:50:01,087
I'm going to leave that aside cuz it's not really all that important but I do predict that it'll come back

687
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:02,623
Anyway

688
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:03,903
Rodger comes at now

689
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:10,303
Bridgestone is also to talk about

690
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:11,071
Rodger

691
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:15,167
I got these guys are Pros him and Steve are Pros

692
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:18,239
This is just the shittiest

693
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:22,335
Taking the high road stuff ever heard

694
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:35,135
Predicted

695
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:40,255
That's just like such a such a cool like

696
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:44,351
Hey look I'm not happy just make

697
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:46,911
M

698
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:48,703
How do you think you can get away with that

699
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:50,751
Rhetorically

700
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:57,151
Every single time that Rodger was on

701
00:50:57,407 --> 00:51:03,551
Did you read that report those just do 20 he says

702
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:09,951
He does touch on that anyway

703
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:18,655
Interesting Rogers be really mad that you didn't know during his trial

704
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:24,287
Was under investigation because Bannon was a witness against him

705
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:28,127
The government obligation

706
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:33,503
Was under federal investigation

707
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:52,191
Show me

708
00:51:57,823 --> 00:52:03,967
Classy classics

709
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:10,367
Clock doesn't inviolate

710
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:19,071
You should probably be lit on fire Ave you seen wicker man that was pretty good

711
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:21,887
Sacrificing now I wish him the best of luck in the yard

712
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:25,983
I would say my response.

713
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:31,871
This investigation is not essential to each character

714
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:36,223
What what are you what are you talk about if you couldn't have done any prior

715
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:41,599
I don't know if he's going to help

716
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:47,999
You can't bring up all this together

717
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:51,583
When

718
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:57,983
We were talking about the immediate reaction that Alex had to shadowgate

719
00:52:58,495 --> 00:53:01,055
So it was a yes

720
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:03,103
First immediate reaction

721
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:07,455
Then I was just reacting with I don't know s*** about this

722
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:09,759
I don't get involved with secret stuff

723
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:11,551
It wasn't even the Gate of AJ

724
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:13,087
Call Alex.

725
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:14,111
Is take

726
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:16,159
Publicly available information

727
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:19,999
Now

728
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:22,303
Yes groveling lines

729
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:38,687
There's no honor among Thieves

730
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:45,087
Secret sources

731
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:45,855
Embarrass Trump

732
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:49,695
It's just not fair it's just not fair

733
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:57,631
You know you get through it through it every now and again it still hits you it's just like this is just not fair

734
00:53:58,399 --> 00:54:00,959
I mean

735
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:04,031
Outside with it most of the time but when he says that it's just

736
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:05,055
Yuri

737
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:11,455
Slap me in the face with a glove and was like snow I never hate you

738
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:13,759
I never hit you at least give me something

739
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:18,111
Right right

740
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:24,767
Next

741
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:26,559
Navigation

742
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:29,375
Chinese

743
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:42,687
Rodger is very careful not to say the person's name because that dude

744
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:46,015
Sued Rodger for 100 million dollars

745
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:49,855
That was Miles Kwok

746
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:56,255
God Rodger I heard about 8

747
00:54:56,511 --> 00:55:02,655
Never even talked about it

748
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:09,055
Millie Weaver I've been hearing a lot about must insist

749
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:11,359
This person's name

750
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:15,711
Because it only gets sued again

751
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:18,527
Interesting

752
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:22,111
Pretty interesting Alex always

753
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:27,743
In interviews is like 25 more minutes always like me back when I used to drink

754
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:33,631
And Alex is like

755
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:36,703
In almost every interview and almost every time

756
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:37,471
People are like

757
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:40,543
Yeah let's let's go ahead and do a little more

758
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:41,823
Rodger

759
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:45,407
Fuel factoid

760
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:46,687
Cyborg

761
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:52,831
Busy

762
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:59,231
Rogers Gattaca

763
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:07,679
Talked about how Bannon suck

764
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:13,311
But then also been like I've also spread

765
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:15,615
Just enough suspicion about

766
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:22,271
Manning intersecting with my trial to buy a very definite connection

767
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:27,903
White and Shifty

768
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:30,207
Alex Costa bright

769
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:31,743
Comes back

770
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:33,279
And

771
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:35,583
Really was weird

772
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:36,863
I got worried

773
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:42,495
Times when I go where the township is so dramatic

774
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:44,287
What's going to happen

775
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:45,311
He's going to happen

776
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:48,127
Let me just get rid of this right now

777
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:53,247
You sound unhappy

778
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:56,319
When I say I'm going to be honest with you just means that

779
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:13,983
What

780
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:24,223
I'm so scared

781
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:30,623
Terrified

782
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:37,023
Because I can't be honest when I tell you that I got to be honest

783
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:41,119
What are you doing

784
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:46,239
Worried me and doesn't get to the point

785
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:49,055
Keeps going down we were roads like

786
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:50,847
Racist

787
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:52,383
But

788
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:55,967
Vietnamese wedding and in certain ways are losing

789
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:05,695
Trouble

790
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:17,983
Real issues

791
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:20,031
New World Order

792
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:22,079
Mothership is killing everybody

793
00:58:41,279 --> 00:58:41,791
People

794
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:08,415
I'm so fucken scared

795
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:11,231
Make this make sense

796
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:14,815
This is what happened right after Alex's

797
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:16,351
Exasperated

798
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:26,847
Hey you know why because I'm white

799
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:29,407
Sport me

800
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:35,807
And I can lead into that and be more outwardly racist and that's super profitable only for a little while

801
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:39,903
What is he his career

802
00:59:40,415 --> 00:59:46,559
Is that what he did he just some up like since he joined Trump is like well you know

803
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:49,119
That works really well for a little while but then

804
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:55,519
It all caught up to me on account of I'm being sued by everybody for all the things that I did for

805
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:14,207
Doesn't

806
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:20,863
This is sort of a stray thought that he's rambling around like he's clearly dealing with something

807
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:21,631
It is

808
01:00:22,655 --> 01:00:24,191
Because he just keeps going and he's

809
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:28,031
Valley View

810
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:38,783
Stop

811
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:40,575
Smart

812
01:00:40,831 --> 01:00:42,623
Before the show and just

813
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:44,159
6 hours

814
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:48,255
Read and talk about the first time

815
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:56,191
Devil worshiper

816
01:00:58,239 --> 01:01:00,799
What are you talkin about trout

817
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:03,871
You should stop doing any research

818
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:08,479
What are you doing

819
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:14,879
Hire somebody else to do all of the research for him and then read and analyze those articles that he'll

820
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:18,463
Like to talk about directly to him and then he can just react

821
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:24,863
Tonight

822
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:31,007
I think he thinks that the writers are doing that for him now

823
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:33,311
There are no

824
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:34,591
That's fair

825
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:37,663
I look like I'm tempted to stop work

826
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:41,247
You don't work now

827
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:45,087
What does he think he's doing I don't know

828
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:09,663
Eat sandwich while you're swimming

829
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:12,991
So I was listening to this and I was troubled

830
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:16,575
I didn't know what the

831
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:18,879
And then even more than that

832
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:19,903
I was confused

833
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:23,999
Because he was not being specific at all about what he's talkin about her

834
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:27,071
Admitting this next trip I kind of got a sense of what this might be

835
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:31,167
Call Barta

836
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:32,447
Modesto

837
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:35,263
This morning

838
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:53,183
So there's some Children's Program

839
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:56,255
Thomas the Tank Engine is gone

840
01:02:57,791 --> 01:03:01,375
I mean I had a sense this was about those Netflix

841
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:02,655
Posters

842
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:06,239
For that show or a movie

843
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:12,639
French movie cuties

844
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:17,503
Something down because people are pissed off

845
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:26,207
Hyper-sexualization

846
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:32,607
The prism of like sexualized

847
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:35,679
Aim

848
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:42,079
I I had a sense that maybe it was something like that but even so this was in the movie for kids

849
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:43,359
Children

850
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:48,735
Okay well it has kittens for kids I don't know

851
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:50,783
It's um it's interesting

852
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:53,087
Children's programming

853
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:56,927
Philippine specific I just I didn't know what was going on

854
01:03:57,439 --> 01:03:59,231
He wants to kill people

855
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:28,415
Henley people mad

856
01:04:28,671 --> 01:04:31,487
I didn't know what you was talkin about

857
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:34,815
Context Clues on infowars.com

858
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:38,399
And there was an article from National flyovers reposted on Infowars

859
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:39,935
Clearly what he's talking about

860
01:04:40,191 --> 01:04:43,263
It was for a show a Netflix show from last year

861
01:04:43,775 --> 01:04:44,799
RuPaul

862
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:45,567
From last year

863
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:46,335
Yeah

864
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:48,383
Call AJ and the Queen

865
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:53,247
Okay it was about a drag performer who befriends a ten-year-old

866
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:59,903
Trailer

867
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:00,671
Alex

868
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:07,327
Screw up a stairway

869
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:13,727
A bit of an overreaction it's a trailer I also don't think children

870
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:17,311
I don't I don't necessarily think that was a children

871
01:05:17,823 --> 01:05:18,591
I don't know anymore.

872
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:23,711
Yeah it has children supposed to be for children until the trailer

873
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:28,575
That's what he's talking about that's what the article

874
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:30,623
They pick matches up to

875
01:05:30,879 --> 01:05:36,511
Certainly drives into water kill

876
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:39,583
Just make Angels in the Outfield every every year

877
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:41,631
It's wholesome

878
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:42,399
Is it worth

879
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:43,935
Also

880
01:05:44,447 --> 01:05:50,591
If you watch Angels in the Outfield you don't have to take on the pain

881
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:53,919
These trailers like this gives him great pain

882
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:07,999
You're supposed to take on the plane

883
01:06:14,399 --> 01:06:14,911
Look at

884
01:06:15,167 --> 01:06:16,191
One little piece

885
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:39,231
Convey to

886
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:48,703
You know what we all started

887
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:49,727
Okay

888
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:50,495
Alright

889
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:53,055
You know when you only saw one set of footprints

890
01:06:56,127 --> 01:07:02,271
I think this is a little bit of

891
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:06,111
AJ and the Queen

892
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:16,863
I actually wrote that

893
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:20,191
Inspiration for Tom Clancy's

894
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:23,519
Is AJ and the queen true I heard that on Alex's

895
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:27,103
Calm down

896
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:28,895
Yeah

897
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:30,431
Trailer shouldn't make

898
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:31,199
People

899
01:07:31,455 --> 01:07:31,967
Angry

900
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:36,575
No and I honestly while I was watching that sounded two rings very full

901
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:43,231
Be very fake yeah outrage

902
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:44,511
Weather where

903
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:45,279
That

904
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:50,143
There were these quote-unquote save the children marches playing for the weekend

905
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:57,823
You know you certainly likes you in on stuff even if

906
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:01,919
Cast and make it like a more

907
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:04,735
Front facing passionate presentation

908
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:07,039
In anticipation of that becoming

909
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:13,439
Something that he covers more children

910
01:08:13,695 --> 01:08:15,999
Murder because of a trailer

911
01:08:16,255 --> 01:08:16,767
Okay

912
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:20,095
What are other reasons that I feel like is very false

913
01:08:20,351 --> 01:08:23,679
Very performative does this whole segment

914
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:26,239
The place

915
01:08:26,495 --> 01:08:27,519
Meandering

916
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:30,847
Rambling nonsensical

917
01:08:31,103 --> 01:08:34,687
He doesn't entire segment about how you going to go down to Barton Springs

918
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:35,967
With a food truck

919
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:40,831
Just left the City of Austin has declared Parks and Recreation

920
01:08:42,623 --> 01:08:43,135
Calling

921
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:45,695
Emergency

922
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:48,767
We went down last weekend

923
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:50,047
People

924
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:52,863
Jump in Barton Creek

925
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:59,519
Multiple times on this episode Alex mentions people passing out

926
01:08:59,775 --> 01:09:00,543
Emergency

927
01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:05,663
Zoom versus me that Europe

928
01:09:05,919 --> 01:09:09,247
Not taking care of any of the people come to your rally

929
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:12,831
Sometimes cause and effects needs to escape

930
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:14,111
You know

931
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:16,927
But sometimes there's very clear causes and effects

932
01:09:17,183 --> 01:09:19,743
Review are hurting people with your dumb s***

933
01:09:19,999 --> 01:09:26,143
People are going to be like

934
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:34,335
Alex talks

935
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:37,151
About how great

936
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:44,831
What makes it really funny is that we end up in this

937
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:46,623
Very familiar territory

938
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:48,671
Let me do this

939
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:08,383
Gestalt

940
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:16,831
Because it's

941
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:17,855
Operation

942
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:25,791
I'm talking about how we're going to go swimming is going to be great and then

943
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:29,887
The news I got to get that in order

944
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:32,191
In order to do a protracted plug

945
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:34,239
Pissed

946
01:10:35,519 --> 01:10:37,055
Everything is so petty

947
01:10:37,311 --> 01:10:43,455
Everything is so petty of their grievances are so stupid and pathetic

948
01:10:43,711 --> 01:10:49,855
Steve is the elevated level of international espionage

949
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:53,695
Ryan Daniel not real and not true

950
01:10:53,951 --> 01:10:54,975
Bigger

951
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:55,743
Then

952
01:10:55,999 --> 01:10:57,279
I'm going swimming

953
01:10:57,535 --> 01:10:58,559
It's going to be a great weekend

954
01:10:58,815 --> 01:11:01,887
I want Melania to be queen of Earth

955
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:05,471
What is the thing is that you noticed that this like

956
01:11:05,727 --> 01:11:10,591
Swimming at Barton Springs protest has certainly.

957
01:11:10,847 --> 01:11:16,991
I'm going to save everyone who's been wrongly convicted of DUI

958
01:11:17,247 --> 01:11:23,391
You don't have to go to the police office nobody nobody asks you questions

959
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:29,791
Effort for someone else's behalf

960
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:36,191
Really sucky

961
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:49,247
Remember a product name

962
01:11:49,503 --> 01:11:50,527
Jesus

963
01:11:51,295 --> 01:11:52,575
He's trying to sell some fusion

964
01:11:54,367 --> 01:11:56,159
Gone

965
01:11:58,463 --> 01:11:59,743
Discontinued

966
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:01,791
Incredible

967
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:06,655
Family Show

968
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:10,239
Fusion

969
01:12:15,615 --> 01:12:19,199
Doesn't exist anymore

970
01:12:19,455 --> 01:12:25,599
You are his own secret

971
01:12:25,855 --> 01:12:31,999
Maybe he's been doing too much I would describe how this plug and Alex

972
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:36,351
Sad

973
01:12:43,263 --> 01:12:44,543
Essential specials

974
01:12:55,295 --> 01:12:56,319
They got usual

975
01:12:57,343 --> 01:12:59,647
Trying to remember the name of our

976
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:00,671
Parasite

977
01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:06,047
Drive me insane

978
01:13:06,303 --> 01:13:07,583
Gut punching

979
01:13:07,839 --> 01:13:08,351
What is that

980
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:10,655
Johnny Depp powerstack is not

981
01:13:18,591 --> 01:13:20,127
What is the name of that Prada

982
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:29,087
So I know

983
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:37,535
You need a boss like Alex needs somebody to write

984
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:46,239
I understand

985
01:13:46,495 --> 01:13:47,519
Do you have a certain

986
01:13:47,775 --> 01:13:50,847
Set of skills you can ramble about things people find it funny

987
01:13:51,615 --> 01:13:57,759
You're putting on a show you can't do a minute of not remembering something

988
01:13:58,015 --> 01:14:04,159
Putting it in your earpiece the type of place that should take

989
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:07,231
What don't you

990
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:12,607
Take this and then kill them off

991
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:13,631
It's fine

992
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:16,447
You do it all the time

993
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:21,823
Product but he does remember

994
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:23,615
You went to a smartro

995
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:26,943
Conference in 1996

996
01:14:27,455 --> 01:14:28,991
2000

997
01:14:32,575 --> 01:14:34,623
Smart growth conference in Austin

998
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:43,327
Abusing people

999
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:50,239
We are

1000
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:14,303
Convenience

1001
01:15:14,559 --> 01:15:17,887
About a film

1002
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:20,191
Mm mm

1003
01:15:20,447 --> 01:15:20,959
How

1004
01:15:21,727 --> 01:15:27,871
Movies really dramatic moments in

1005
01:15:34,527 --> 01:15:35,295
Sure

1006
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:42,463
What are the one of the things I want to really stress answer the listeners don't

1007
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:44,511
Make it there Habit to listen to Alex

1008
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:45,791
You show on the regular

1009
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:47,071
What is a

1010
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:50,655
Really frustrating about it show is

1011
01:15:51,423 --> 01:15:52,447
Most of it is

1012
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:56,799
Extemporaneous bulshit a lot of research

1013
01:15:57,055 --> 01:16:01,663
Know a lot of relying on fake research that he's done

1014
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:09,343
The long stretches of time sometimes someone will pull up something on

1015
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:14,463
On the screen.

1016
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:20,863
Every now and then I'll really try to get to the news and when he does

1017
01:16:21,631 --> 01:16:23,167
Reading headlines

1018
01:16:23,423 --> 01:16:24,191
No contacts

1019
01:16:24,447 --> 01:16:25,727
Go project Littleton

1020
01:16:25,983 --> 01:16:26,751
A little like

1021
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:28,799
A little clip a little later

1022
01:16:32,895 --> 01:16:36,735
And this is a story about American Airlines

1023
01:16:36,991 --> 01:16:38,783
They're going to trim

1024
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:41,343
Some cities service to some City

1025
01:16:41,599 --> 01:16:43,135
And this is basically

1026
01:16:43,391 --> 01:16:44,415
Buddy

1027
01:16:52,095 --> 01:16:53,887
His analysis of it is

1028
01:16:54,143 --> 01:16:58,495
Nonexistent pretending

1029
01:16:59,263 --> 01:17:02,079
Which I don't know how he's justifying

1030
01:17:02,591 --> 01:17:03,359
8 they're not

1031
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:04,383
But would they

1032
01:17:04,639 --> 01:17:07,455
Why would they celebrate celebrate

1033
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:12,831
That's fair that's fair

1034
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:19,231
We got to be more cautious with our punctuated an article about it if they weren't so

1035
01:17:19,487 --> 01:17:20,511
Celebrating

1036
01:17:24,095 --> 01:17:29,983
The assertion that CNN is celebrating this is completely unfounded and it's just in order to make

1037
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:36,383
Sienna and look like a Cheerio a that are

1038
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:42,783
Is there an expectation

1039
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:43,807
Issues

1040
01:17:44,063 --> 01:17:49,695
The Imp impact that all those are probably all in that story with that headline you didn't read it

1041
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:53,791
You know

1042
01:17:55,327 --> 01:18:01,215
I read some headlines

1043
01:18:12,223 --> 01:18:13,759
Garbage

1044
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:26,303
Nervous

1045
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:28,095
Earlier

1046
01:18:28,351 --> 01:18:29,375
The name of that

1047
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:31,935
Free shipping on it and it's

1048
01:18:32,191 --> 01:18:32,703
Turn off

1049
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:35,519
Living defense

1050
01:18:35,775 --> 01:18:41,919
Okay what happened earlier

1051
01:18:42,175 --> 01:18:44,223
I'm just saying

1052
01:18:46,783 --> 01:18:49,855
I just don't understand why he calls them sex when you could just

1053
01:18:50,111 --> 01:18:51,135
Call them your eight

1054
01:18:51,391 --> 01:18:57,535
Pac power sack every time

1055
01:18:57,791 --> 01:19:00,607
Be selling

1056
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:02,143
He's not going to make it

1057
01:19:02,399 --> 01:19:03,679
He doesn't come back

1058
01:19:03,935 --> 01:19:05,471
And get into his covid stats

1059
01:19:07,519 --> 01:19:08,543
Instead

1060
01:19:08,799 --> 01:19:11,359
He does what I've needed him to do

1061
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:12,639
This whole time

1062
01:19:12,895 --> 01:19:14,687
Getting to the Middle Ages

1063
01:19:15,967 --> 01:19:16,479
Something here that I

1064
01:19:22,367 --> 01:19:22,879
Lemur

1065
01:19:23,647 --> 01:19:24,159
Yesterday

1066
01:19:24,415 --> 01:19:28,255
Because of the

1067
01:19:31,327 --> 01:19:32,095
Good to know

1068
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:34,399
Adjust still happen to occur

1069
01:19:34,655 --> 01:19:38,239
Simultaneously with the release of the bilge alligate

1070
01:19:38,495 --> 01:19:44,639
I mean I think he's trying to say he does end up slicing out

1071
01:19:45,151 --> 01:19:48,223
Content of the movie

1072
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:50,271
She's hanging out with weirdo

1073
01:19:54,111 --> 01:19:55,903
The office

1074
01:19:59,487 --> 01:20:00,511
Brought up

1075
01:20:24,064 --> 01:20:25,344
What if I don't talk about it

1076
01:20:27,904 --> 01:20:29,440
I was I heard that has like

1077
01:20:29,952 --> 01:20:35,584
Listen to our episodes

1078
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:41,984
Who around here

1079
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:43,008
Kaitlin Bennett

1080
01:20:43,264 --> 01:20:49,408
Former friend

1081
01:20:49,664 --> 01:20:53,760
Millie Weaver excuse me now

1082
01:20:55,296 --> 01:21:01,440
Apparently she's dug up some dirt on Harrisburg

1083
01:21:01,696 --> 01:21:03,744
Starkweather

1084
01:21:04,256 --> 01:21:06,560
Might be about us

1085
01:21:07,072 --> 01:21:10,400
Alex doesn't like

1086
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:34,720
Oh

1087
01:21:34,976 --> 01:21:35,488
Okay

1088
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:42,144
Okay if you send him a Punisher logo that he goes further that's a rule that's a hard and fast rule

1089
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:46,752
Used to be on Twitter

1090
01:21:47,008 --> 01:21:53,152
Message the info gif

1091
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:57,504
A gray white

1092
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:05,184
I know a couple times early on

1093
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:08,512
Very seldom

1094
01:22:08,768 --> 01:22:14,912
And no response

1095
01:22:15,936 --> 01:22:16,448
Rent-A-Wreck

1096
01:22:17,216 --> 01:22:19,520
No but I think it's really interesting to see you

1097
01:22:19,776 --> 01:22:21,824
Alex's is expressing that like

1098
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:23,360
I'm going to now

1099
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:24,384
Dory

1100
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:27,200
Nitric birdie coming for you

1101
01:22:27,456 --> 01:22:33,344
Heading back so I'm excited to see if

1102
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:35,136
Because Alex

1103
01:22:35,392 --> 01:22:35,904
Kind of like

1104
01:22:36,416 --> 01:22:38,720
I'm going to say my piece and then I'm done with

1105
01:22:44,352 --> 01:22:46,656
Five bucks

1106
01:22:46,912 --> 01:22:47,424
This morning

1107
01:22:50,496 --> 01:22:51,264
Kaitlin Bennett

1108
01:22:54,592 --> 01:22:55,104
We found

1109
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:01,248
Trampoline

1110
01:23:04,576 --> 01:23:06,624
Or getting arrested

1111
01:23:12,768 --> 01:23:14,048
What's the film came out

1112
01:23:25,312 --> 01:23:26,336
But this is what attack

1113
01:23:31,712 --> 01:23:33,760
She did well we ever total freedom

1114
01:23:34,016 --> 01:23:38,112
So Alex is just basically being like Millie got to a certain point of

1115
01:23:38,624 --> 01:23:40,160
Same

1116
01:23:40,416 --> 01:23:46,560
Craigslist

1117
01:23:47,072 --> 01:23:50,912
And realize the sort of delicate nature of the Griff we're on here

1118
01:23:51,168 --> 01:23:57,312
Alex

1119
01:23:57,568 --> 01:23:59,616
I'm sitting here like I hate that I have to be composite

1120
01:24:00,128 --> 01:24:06,272
This is actually a smart move for me

1121
01:24:06,528 --> 01:24:12,672
This this is the lowest level of self-preservation

1122
01:24:12,928 --> 01:24:16,000
Yeah yeah this is

1123
01:24:16,256 --> 01:24:17,536
Like legit

1124
01:24:18,048 --> 01:24:20,608
I don't know what they're going to do they're going to blow up our spot

1125
01:24:20,864 --> 01:24:24,704
Do if we are associated too closely with them you don't know what they're going to do

1126
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:25,984
You can't do this

1127
01:24:27,264 --> 01:24:29,824
So yeah honestly

1128
01:24:30,336 --> 01:24:33,664
Golden State's Alex confirm

1129
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:35,968
My assertion

1130
01:24:36,224 --> 01:24:42,368
Beating the s*** out of your mom and getting arrested for it is not what will get you fired from Infowars

1131
01:24:43,136 --> 01:24:44,416
That's what that's what I thought

1132
01:24:46,976 --> 01:24:50,048
So in this

1133
01:24:53,632 --> 01:24:55,168
Peter farewell

1134
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:57,728
This is

1135
01:24:57,984 --> 01:25:00,800
Goodbye Melly

1136
01:25:03,872 --> 01:25:05,152
On Monday

1137
01:25:06,944 --> 01:25:07,712
Because it's my side

1138
01:25:08,224 --> 01:25:08,736
Operation

1139
01:25:11,808 --> 01:25:12,320
Is the film

1140
01:25:33,568 --> 01:25:34,336
Stop

1141
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:35,872
The truth

1142
01:25:36,128 --> 01:25:42,272
You're working with triple treat you real good

1143
01:25:46,112 --> 01:25:46,624
Air Jordan

1144
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:49,696
This is really fascinating because

1145
01:25:50,464 --> 01:25:51,488
This this is history

1146
01:25:52,256 --> 01:25:57,376
Millie Weaver is officially the first person to be banned from Band video

1147
01:26:01,216 --> 01:26:02,752
Alex

1148
01:26:03,008 --> 01:26:04,800
My God

1149
01:26:05,312 --> 01:26:05,824
Alex

1150
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:08,384
Alex, are you saying that because

1151
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:11,968
Your website is a private Enterprise

1152
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:18,624
You have the ability to remove anyone who you do not particularly like

1153
01:26:21,184 --> 01:26:24,512
You know obviously that's her right

1154
01:26:25,024 --> 01:26:31,168
Technology down to remove this from

1155
01:26:31,424 --> 01:26:37,056
Millie

1156
01:26:37,568 --> 01:26:43,712
I don't Delight in her downfall at all but I'll tell you right now I knew this was coming from

1157
01:26:43,968 --> 01:26:48,576
That she was behaving earlier and I think she deserves what she's going to get out of it

1158
01:26:48,832 --> 01:26:49,600
Now

1159
01:26:50,368 --> 01:26:53,440
This is trouble for Alex because they've been promoting

1160
01:26:53,952 --> 01:27:00,096
For the last month she has the sunrise movement

1161
01:27:00,352 --> 01:27:02,912
Anything that you said

1162
01:27:09,568 --> 01:27:15,712
Shadowgate

1163
01:27:18,528 --> 01:27:22,368
Millie Weaver getting fired

1164
01:27:24,928 --> 01:27:25,696
Just what a week

1165
01:27:25,952 --> 01:27:26,464
What are we

1166
01:27:27,744 --> 01:27:29,280
College

1167
01:27:32,096 --> 01:27:34,656
I should have used the Alex Jones

1168
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:36,704
1520

1169
01:27:49,504 --> 01:27:51,552
Great grasp of History

1170
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:54,368
Volume

1171
01:27:54,624 --> 01:28:00,256
We'll get back to this here in a second I love the idea that he has volumes about the occult

1172
01:28:00,512 --> 01:28:01,280
At 11

1173
01:28:01,536 --> 01:28:04,352
And then was a Satanist

1174
01:28:05,632 --> 01:28:09,984
About that makes

1175
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:11,264
Timeline screwed

1176
01:28:16,128 --> 01:28:16,640
Was it

1177
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:30,976
Different ideas are weird

1178
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:34,816
You're being popped

1179
01:28:35,584 --> 01:28:36,608
How would you know

1180
01:28:39,424 --> 01:28:40,192
Don't you didn't

1181
01:28:43,776 --> 01:28:44,800
So I mean

1182
01:28:45,056 --> 01:28:51,200
Everyone's really stupid cuz they go to college when they could just read encyclopedias as a child

1183
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:56,576
I understand that kind of thought

1184
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:58,112
Higher education

1185
01:28:58,624 --> 01:28:59,136
Right

1186
01:28:59,648 --> 01:29:05,792
You think you can find that you know people are self-taught many people

1187
01:29:06,048 --> 01:29:07,584
Amazing things yourself.

1188
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:08,864
Alex Jones

1189
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:13,984
You cannot learn none of those people were like sometime life now I'm done

1190
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:16,032
Self teaching

1191
01:29:21,152 --> 01:29:22,176
Think that

1192
01:29:22,432 --> 01:29:23,968
College is mandatory

1193
01:29:24,224 --> 01:29:27,808
I don't think that there are a lot of incredibly intelligent

1194
01:29:29,088 --> 01:29:29,856
High-functioning

1195
01:29:30,112 --> 01:29:34,720
Brilliant people

1196
01:29:41,376 --> 01:29:42,656
I will never

1197
01:29:44,448 --> 01:29:45,984
Hear somebody like Alex

1198
01:29:46,496 --> 01:29:47,520
Who didn't go to college

1199
01:29:47,776 --> 01:29:48,800
Say things like

1200
01:29:49,056 --> 01:29:52,128
Teacher that ideas are weird

1201
01:29:57,248 --> 01:30:03,392
Higher education essential for for everybody and

1202
01:30:05,952 --> 01:30:09,792
One thing I feel like he has no concept

1203
01:30:10,304 --> 01:30:16,448
Is the fundamental flaw and if your education consists of your parents buying you any book you want

1204
01:30:16,704 --> 01:30:18,496
There is an issue there

1205
01:30:19,008 --> 01:30:22,592
Many of the things that I learned a lot from where books that I did not want

1206
01:30:23,104 --> 01:30:29,248
Do not want those horses rules

1207
01:30:29,504 --> 01:30:30,272
You read that

1208
01:30:30,528 --> 01:30:36,672
Self-selecting for your own

1209
01:30:36,928 --> 01:30:37,696
In college

1210
01:30:38,208 --> 01:30:40,768
That I learn

1211
01:30:41,024 --> 01:30:41,792
Exactly

1212
01:30:48,192 --> 01:30:49,984
Not going to read this b*******

1213
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:56,128
Somebody music yeah and I'm looking at it and I'm reading the first two chapters just

1214
01:30:57,664 --> 01:30:59,200
How can we escape this book

1215
01:30:59,456 --> 01:31:03,808
Exactly

1216
01:31:09,952 --> 01:31:10,976
I haven't read a book

1217
01:31:18,144 --> 01:31:19,424
Hundreds and hundreds a year

1218
01:31:21,984 --> 01:31:24,288
Most nicest

1219
01:31:29,152 --> 01:31:31,200
You only finish 800 up

1220
01:31:34,784 --> 01:31:38,880
Straight up lie

1221
01:31:39,136 --> 01:31:45,280
Set this image of the burn the Midnight Oil

1222
01:31:45,536 --> 01:31:48,096
Such a narcissistic just like

1223
01:31:48,352 --> 01:31:53,216
Not only have I read a lot of books I've read more books than you can comprehend

1224
01:31:53,472 --> 01:31:56,032
Hundreds of books

1225
01:31:56,288 --> 01:31:58,592
A day I'm Wilt Chamberlain

1226
01:31:58,848 --> 01:32:02,944
Books that's what happened you know how many potential universes there are

1227
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:05,504
How many books I read today

1228
01:32:06,272 --> 01:32:08,320
21st

1229
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:12,416
Is Deanna Lorraine again it looks like

1230
01:32:12,672 --> 01:32:13,184
Maybe

1231
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:14,976
She's doing a job interview

1232
01:32:15,232 --> 01:32:18,304
To replace milk

1233
01:32:18,816 --> 01:32:20,352
If she were on Skype

1234
01:32:20,608 --> 01:32:21,632
How do you think this interview

1235
01:32:21,888 --> 01:32:25,472
But using Studio

1236
01:32:25,728 --> 01:32:27,264
Who cares I don't really care

1237
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:30,592
Little story

1238
01:32:33,408 --> 01:32:35,968
A.m.

1239
01:32:42,112 --> 01:32:43,392
He's driving me jogging

1240
01:32:48,512 --> 01:32:50,048
Ryan

1241
01:32:53,632 --> 01:32:55,424
Weird neurotic

1242
01:32:56,704 --> 01:33:01,312
Like this thing that I just imagining Alex

1243
01:33:01,568 --> 01:33:02,080
Can't lie

1244
01:33:02,336 --> 01:33:08,480
And he's not making things up before

1245
01:33:08,736 --> 01:33:12,320
Navigate to the show

1246
01:33:12,576 --> 01:33:18,720
This morning really early see the trailer for something rose up in the stairwell.

1247
01:33:18,976 --> 01:33:22,304
For half an hour on the floor and then goes jogging

1248
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:33,824
You still got to get your exercise in maintaining your but his body

1249
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:35,616
Is the temple.

1250
01:33:36,384 --> 01:33:36,896
Certainly has

1251
01:33:37,408 --> 01:33:43,552
I find this difficult to believe on this long hike or people with masks

1252
01:33:43,808 --> 01:33:49,952
Coming up the stairwell

1253
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:52,000
Has Leo zagami committed

1254
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:56,608
A well he is

1255
01:33:56,864 --> 01:33:58,912
That is not bulshit

1256
01:33:59,168 --> 01:34:01,984
Closer here

1257
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:07,360
At least it is much as like now we know that Alex

1258
01:34:07,616 --> 01:34:11,968
Appreciate that

1259
01:34:12,224 --> 01:34:15,552
Shadowgate

1260
01:34:15,808 --> 01:34:18,624
We talked about the actual movie talked about Alex's

1261
01:34:19,648 --> 01:34:21,952
Do use it

1262
01:34:22,208 --> 01:34:26,816
And then on Friday or show on Friday we talked about the weird

1263
01:34:27,584 --> 01:34:33,728
What why are you talkin about this at all

1264
01:34:33,984 --> 01:34:36,800
Yeah you know like none of this is a movie

1265
01:34:37,056 --> 01:34:37,824
No sense

1266
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:39,616
Nope it's stupid

1267
01:34:39,872 --> 01:34:40,896
Their relationship

1268
01:34:41,408 --> 01:34:47,552
As ridiculous as that as it was his only less ridiculous

1269
01:34:47,808 --> 01:34:53,952
Relationship

1270
01:34:54,208 --> 01:34:54,976
Close

1271
01:34:55,744 --> 01:34:56,512
Probably not

1272
01:34:57,024 --> 01:34:58,048
But we're done with it

1273
01:35:00,608 --> 01:35:01,120
I don't know

1274
01:35:01,376 --> 01:35:07,520
Time travel in the past for Wednesday we have

1275
01:35:07,776 --> 01:35:09,312
Dumbness

1276
01:35:09,568 --> 01:35:13,408
Yeah chapter has opened up in

1277
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:15,456
I feel like

1278
01:35:18,016 --> 01:35:22,112
Obviously we can't we can't leave the present day alone cuz

1279
01:35:22,368 --> 01:35:23,648
Coming up to intellectual

1280
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:26,720
She's getting

1281
01:35:26,976 --> 01:35:28,512
So I feel like

1282
01:35:28,768 --> 01:35:30,304
Something that I made

1283
01:35:30,816 --> 01:35:31,584
Is

1284
01:35:32,608 --> 01:35:34,912
One of the things

1285
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:42,080
Over the course of the shows that whenever we set out to do investigation

1286
01:35:42,336 --> 01:35:43,616
And time travel and stuff

1287
01:35:44,896 --> 01:35:45,408
We've been

1288
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:47,712
Because we have a question

1289
01:35:47,968 --> 01:35:50,016
Answer

1290
01:35:50,272 --> 01:35:54,624
For the answer to that question and I think that's a bad way to go about it

1291
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:56,672
So I'm thinking maybe we time travel

1292
01:35:56,928 --> 01:36:02,048
Just see what happened maybe we just pick a random day

1293
01:36:02,304 --> 01:36:08,448
But I think that maybe we go around when something

1294
01:36:09,728 --> 01:36:10,240
Pink or like

1295
01:36:10,496 --> 01:36:11,264
When did Alex

1296
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:13,056
Josiah disappear trailer

1297
01:36:13,312 --> 01:36:14,592
Sure

1298
01:36:14,848 --> 01:36:20,992
Here is a time in history right let's see what happens

1299
01:36:28,416 --> 01:36:30,464
I don't want to let you control

1300
01:36:30,976 --> 01:36:32,000
Mario

1301
01:36:32,256 --> 01:36:37,888
Focus on the present it really is just at his whim

1302
01:36:38,144 --> 01:36:39,680
Women boring

1303
01:36:40,192 --> 01:36:41,472
It hurts me personally

1304
01:36:41,728 --> 01:36:44,032
So I'm not going to stand for it anymore

1305
01:36:44,288 --> 01:36:46,080
I'm going to start my Independence

1306
01:36:46,336 --> 01:36:48,896
It's a go f*** yourself Alex you can

1307
01:36:49,408 --> 01:36:51,712
Stairwell

1308
01:36:51,968 --> 01:36:55,296
Take a hike I don't give a s*** I like

1309
01:36:55,808 --> 01:37:01,952
Yeah this is built like a very Complete Saga

1310
01:37:23,712 --> 01:37:29,344
The only thing that I regret is I wish I could have been contained

1311
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:35,744
I feel like there's an asymmetry to that that I don't like

1312
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:40,096
I do feel like the story has been told

1313
01:37:40,352 --> 01:37:41,120
Documentary

1314
01:37:41,376 --> 01:37:45,984
Fallout from documentary Millie is now fired

1315
01:37:51,616 --> 01:37:54,688
The other thing is really motivating me to feel like

1316
01:37:55,968 --> 01:37:56,480
Alright

1317
01:37:56,736 --> 01:38:02,880
Whatever Alex getting arrested

1318
01:38:03,136 --> 01:38:05,440
Intelligence report coming out

1319
01:38:05,696 --> 01:38:09,024
Rodger

1320
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:19,264
Handle

1321
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:20,544
Secrets

1322
01:38:24,128 --> 01:38:28,224
Rogers appeal is going to completely change the Ballgame and exposed

1323
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:34,624
Because you can never get a fair trial

1324
01:38:37,952 --> 01:38:39,488
That's never done anybody any good

1325
01:38:39,744 --> 01:38:41,536
So we'll see where I

1326
01:38:41,792 --> 01:38:47,680
Take a little time to people

1327
01:38:48,192 --> 01:38:48,704
Hey Danny

1328
01:38:49,472 --> 01:38:49,984
All siwa

1329
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:53,312
Just wanted to reach

1330
01:38:59,456 --> 01:38:59,968
Unironically

1331
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:03,552
Here we are now

1332
01:39:14,816 --> 01:39:15,328
It's a remark

1333
01:39:28,128 --> 01:39:28,640
While watching you

1334
01:39:29,664 --> 01:39:30,176
Hope you great

1335
01:39:33,504 --> 01:39:35,296
Thanks Carl.

1336
01:39:35,552 --> 01:39:38,880
Sucks

1337
01:39:39,136 --> 01:39:39,904
Get Reserve there

1338
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:43,232
They're intense playing out Major League

1339
01:39:43,488 --> 01:39:48,352
Like there is almost like they're trying to lose as much as possible in order to sell the team

1340
01:39:48,608 --> 01:39:54,752
And move it out of Boston for some reason cavero

1341
01:39:55,008 --> 01:39:56,032
Are the Red Sox over there

1342
01:39:56,288 --> 01:40:02,432
We'll call it the French monster that's all we'll do a throw-in might be this one

1343
01:40:02,688 --> 01:40:08,832
But they were going to the second

1344
01:40:09,088 --> 01:40:14,464
Best player in baseball

1345
01:40:15,232 --> 01:40:15,744
He got hurt

1346
01:40:17,024 --> 01:40:18,560
Yeah well

1347
01:40:24,448 --> 01:40:25,728
That's terrible I really sucks

1348
01:40:25,984 --> 01:40:29,824
Yourself up too much about there like an hour to newer younger

1349
01:40:35,712 --> 01:40:41,856
Animatronic outdoor. Not necessarily believing everything but I didn't have the same critical

1350
01:40:42,112 --> 01:40:45,952
When I was younger

1351
01:40:46,464 --> 01:40:50,560
Let Yourself Go

1352
01:40:51,072 --> 01:40:51,840
No Tech game

1353
01:41:01,056 --> 01:41:02,080

This one is Wednesday

1357
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:18,720
You know what though I miss

1358
01:41:18,976 --> 01:41:22,816
More than Project Camelot is I miss Project Camelot being innocent

1359
01:41:23,072 --> 01:41:27,168
Yeah yeah in a sense being just fun

1360
01:41:27,424 --> 01:41:33,568
Goofy nonsense the first time we meet captain

1361
01:41:33,824 --> 01:41:38,176
I'm you can really meet captain my preacher you know

1362
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:40,736
You mad is a murderer

1363
01:41:42,784 --> 01:41:43,296
That's fair

1364
01:41:43,552 --> 01:41:48,672
There was such a there was an appealing purity

1365
01:41:49,184 --> 01:41:51,744
The theory is about space and aliens

1366
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,048
Yeah you can stop for a second

1367
01:41:54,304 --> 01:41:55,840
These are just space we

1368
01:41:56,352 --> 01:42:00,704
Yeah you know there people who were people there just face and that's great

1369
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:07,872
Munster does like

1370
01:42:12,992 --> 01:42:17,088
I would like to find something else in scratches that is

1371
01:42:17,344 --> 01:42:19,904
But I do miss it as well hopefully we'll find something

1372
01:42:20,672 --> 01:42:21,440
Dan and Jordan

1373
01:42:21,952 --> 01:42:22,720
This is

1374
01:42:22,976 --> 01:42:23,488

I've been listening to yourself

1378

1398
01:43:06,240 --> 01:43:06,752

1411
01:43:38,752 --> 01:43:43,104
Shout out to Alabama Tide

1412
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:47,200
For sure

1413
01:43:47,456 --> 01:43:53,600
Obviously it definitely wouldn't be this bike that I've heard that from a number that's really cool

1414
01:43:53,856 --> 01:43:55,136
I mean I guess

1415
01:43:55,392 --> 01:44:01,536
Lot of my ideas about how parents are people who are very put off by obscenity

1416
01:44:01,792 --> 01:44:07,936
This feels like it's in impossibilities

1417
01:44:08,192 --> 01:44:11,776
You know I listen to your podcast

1418
01:44:12,032 --> 01:44:14,336
Very clear.

1419
01:44:14,848 --> 01:44:19,200
For a tiny bit

1420
01:44:19,456 --> 01:44:23,552
This isn't the first yell this wasn't this isn't for me

1421
01:44:23,808 --> 01:44:29,952

100%

1423
01:44:33,792 --> 01:44:39,936
Using research

1424
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:46,080
I used one of yours

1425
01:44:46,336 --> 01:44:48,384
Jokes

1426
01:44:55,808 --> 01:45:01,952
Not a bad impression

1427
01:45:24,992 --> 01:45:25,760
French stuff

1428
01:45:28,832 --> 01:45:29,344
Like that

1429
01:45:46,496 --> 01:45:50,592
I try to err on the side of my messages that are

1430
01:45:50,848 --> 01:45:51,872
Strictly just like

1431
01:45:52,128 --> 01:45:57,760

Yeah good thing I point out and one is that still awesome

1433
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:03,648
The escalation

1434
01:46:03,904 --> 01:46:06,208
Possible

1435
01:46:06,464 --> 01:46:10,304
Poor people

1436
01:46:10,816 --> 01:46:12,352
Really humbled

1437
01:46:12,608 --> 01:46:13,632
That really is

1438
01:46:13,888 --> 01:46:15,168
Probably the best

1439
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:20,032
Dealing with people who are going down

1440
01:46:20,288 --> 01:46:22,336
Is it an assumption

1441
01:46:23,616 --> 01:46:24,896
Productive

1442
01:46:25,152 --> 01:46:29,248
Cooling the temperature a little bit

1443
01:46:29,504 --> 01:46:31,552
Event also I wanted to allow

1444
01:46:31,808 --> 01:46:34,368
Shout out for the rest

1445
01:46:34,624 --> 01:46:40,512
I don't know whole lot about the Discord I know that some people running and they have a good time chatting and stuff

1446
01:46:40,768 --> 01:46:42,304
I don't know where it is

1447
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:47,168
How about it

1448
01:46:47,424 --> 01:46:49,728
I got it I got it I don't understand

1449
01:46:55,616 --> 01:47:01,760
Conversations about stuff

1450
01:47:02,016 --> 01:47:05,600
We are very lucky to have a

1451
01:47:05,856 --> 01:47:06,880
A group of people who

1452
01:47:07,136 --> 01:47:08,672
Find each other

1453
01:47:08,928 --> 01:47:09,440
You know like

1454
01:47:09,696 --> 01:47:14,048
Everything that I hear from people who listen to the show about our groups is like

1455
01:47:14,304 --> 01:47:17,120
These are the nicest people that had like we're lucky

1456
01:47:18,912 --> 01:47:25,056
Yeah it's it's I don't know if we rate good people

1457
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:32,224
Not all inside

Forget my voice

1469
01:48:23,424 --> 01:48:26,752
That was a bad line

1470
01:48:27,008 --> 01:48:33,152
Trace of an Australian accent pronunciation

1471
01:48:39,808 --> 01:48:45,952
