1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,992
Damn important swetik

2
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:27,392
I have great respect for knowledge by knowledge I'm sick of them posing as you're through the good guy

3
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:52,992
Freight

4
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:59,136
College vype.com

5
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:11,168
What about Alex Jones

6
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,824
We talked about this a little bit but I have not mentioned it on the show now

7
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,128
Ever giving you an update on it

8
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:22,432
So about maybe

9
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:28,832
Couple weeks ago I was having a frozen pizza and I was putting crushed red pepper on

10
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:29,856
Myself this is good

11
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:31,904
Ride could be better

12
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,208
Yeah I wonder if

13
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:41,120
Other crushed peppers exist like I wonder if you can get a Shaker of habanero flight

14
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:45,472
And they're great

15
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:51,872
It really is a solution to the problem that red pepper flakes have which is like this is good but not quite

16
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:59,296
You can you can plus it you can turn it up turn anything into flakes

17
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:05,696
Trinidad scorpion is not open these up yet to try but I can't handle being

18
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:09,536
Bird my I don't know if I could eat those dry

19
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:13,632
I've got a probably good but it wouldn't be I wouldn't be worth it

20
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:20,032
Discount bottom like yeah break into this little bit later today but

21
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:23,104
Maybe that's evolved its updated soon

22
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:35,904
Is going to be the first episode of this thing that I'm doing I was going to call it a show

23
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:42,304
But it's not on Fridays at 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.

24
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,888

On Twitch and I hope people join us and then we're going to talk about mental illness you know you can

27
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:59,968
Can't play the show on Twitch right you're going to run into a number of

28
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:06,368
Terms of service that you may be unaware of problems

29
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:12,768
Figure it out as I go along okay

30
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:18,656
Final Fantasy 7 for no reason in a month

31
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:25,056
But anyways I'm excited to do it will be fun I think we're going to be back to social distancing soon so this will be a great way

32
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:31,456
Wait at me like we're not going in the right direction I heard some bad news about Chicago

33
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:37,856
So Jordan speaking of bad news for Chicago The Boys Are Back in Town

34
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:48,352
The city as bad news covid wise we had good news and they

35
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:54,752
We're back in studio together and it's good news and and The Boys Are Back in Town

36
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:57,824
The deposition boys

37
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:04,224
By popular demand

38
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:10,624
So

39
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:16,000
Come on

40
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:20,351
Like Charlie Sheen and Emilio Estevez their brothers right Harley Sheen

41
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:22,143
Charlie Sheen you said she

42
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:28,799
I just don't talk right

43
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:41,599
The predictable outside of our show being successful

44
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:45,695
Popular things that we do is we talked about depositions and the World of Alex Jones

45
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:51,327
I'm and today we have a couple of depositions to go over they

46
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:55,679
I have to do with Infowars and Free Speech systems having a

47
00:04:55,935 --> 00:05:02,079
Another chance that having a corporate representative

48
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:08,479
These are two depositions that they're their Hired Gun positions

49
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:13,343
Marcel Fontaine

50
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:16,159
And so yeah it

51
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,487
I don't want to give it away but

52
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:25,887
Yeah this is this

53
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:32,287
Nuts over to World 45 at least

54
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:38,687
Three if you just talk about the stuff that has to do with this phase of the trial rights cuz that just has diarrhea

55
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:39,455
Yeah and then

56
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,479
Well actually

57
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:46,623
And you're probably leave

58
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:53,023
First Jordans

59
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:59,423
First I have a cat named bubbles cousin cousins

60
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:01,727
Start a club thank you so much

61
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:08,127
Could you very much from Bloomfield who was tricked into that Gillette commercial

62
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,663
Will that one time

63
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,943
You're not a policy wonk

64
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:17,343
I'm a policy wonk Canada is pronounced a little draaaake

65
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:22,207
Jimmy Brooks

66
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:25,023
Max pinch my nipple and call me a policy wonk

67
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:31,679
Piceance think is what you're now about as long I'm a policy wonk

68
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:38,079
Obviously that was the pinch had like astric

69
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:44,735
Figured that was the totals for that well I could feel you pulling as you pintus it was heartfelt

70
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:51,135
Inspiration was that the person who sent that name princess stood by saying I'm embarrassed to be

71
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:57,535
Using the English on it

72
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,607
The other angry sweaty fat guy

73
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:06,495
Very much so

74
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:12,895
Adventures in Hell World podcast is doing this weekend

75
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:15,199
Is I'll be better tomorrow

76
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:16,479
You're now a technocrat

77
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:19,807
I'm a policy wonk I have risen above

78
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,623
Miami star

79
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,159
Go take a little break you down

80
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:27,743
A little break e for me

81
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:31,327
And then we're going to come back

82
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,143
And I'm going to start the show over

83
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,263
F*** you

84
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:43,359
I got plenty of words for you but at the end of the day

85
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:45,663
F*** you and your new world order and

86
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,735
She wrote in on and all your s***

87
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,783
Broadcast

88
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:53,599
Maybe I'll just be gone a month baby 5 years

89
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:56,415
Maybe I'll walk out of here tomorrow

90
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,951
And you never see me again

91
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:00,255
That's really what I want to do

92
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:06,143
I never want to come back here again I apologize to the crew in the listener's yesterday that I

93
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:09,471
Was legitimately having breakdowns on air

94
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:16,127
I'll be better tomorrow. Joke's on you

95
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:20,991
Tomorrow or not one good turn deserves another

96
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,271
So

97
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:28,671
We Will We Will delve into these deposition Waters but I would like to tease you

98
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:31,999
View with an out-of-context drop care

99
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:32,767
Supervise

100
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,559
Pacific Apartments

101
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:35,583
Supervisor

102
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:37,631
I don't know who they

103
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:46,591
That's troubling

104
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:48,127
Part of the things you should know

105
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:54,527
That's upsetting are they supervisors

106
00:08:54,783 --> 00:09:00,927
Two bees in watching the news that there's a little things that I'm learning about the experience of being in a room with a lawyer

107
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:03,231
You don't really want to hear

108
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:08,863
One of them is that's troubling

109
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:15,263
It means the conversation that you're having is off the rails

110
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,031
Is like

111
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:18,335
Somebody lawyer

112
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,383
Is asking you a question

113
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:27,039
And then they say thank you after your answer not good take it back not good

114
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:33,439
Whatever it is that you're just said I take it that means they got what they wanted

115
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:39,839
I never knew to be afraid of that but now now holyshit

116
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:48,543
So on February 14th and 15th representative for free speech system set for deposition

117
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:51,871
Marcel Fontaine case respectively

118
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:58,527
Having made embarrassing fumbles with Rob do and Daria karpova and haven't been sanctioned for how ill-prepared

119
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,807
Fulfill their job

120
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:05,183
The company had contracted somebody from the outside of the team to take on the job

121
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:10,303
That person was Brittany Paz a lawyer who's worked with Norm Pattinson the past

122
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:16,703
Nearly impossible task in front of her getting up to speed on the topics that you was expected to be able

123
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,471
Disgust

124
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:20,543
But at the end of the day accept the job

125
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:26,943
It was impossible dollars for it and became responsible for being a cop

126
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:28,479
Appleton corporate representative

127
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:30,527
That's what you took on her player

128
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:36,927
She could have not done that given the impossible nature of the job he's a professional sheet

129
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:39,743
Brought in like a jstor

130
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:43,583
Cut out of what a false-flag is

131
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:49,983
Oh oh yes yeah that would have been funny at the level

132
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:56,383
For a false flag

133
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:00,991
Look down upon the printing out of Wikipedia articles and similar Behavior

134
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:07,391
After that disaster that was darya's deposition

135
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:09,439
I dealt with just about enough b*******

136
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:15,839
Free Speech systems one last chance to provide a corporate representative specific guidelines

137
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:18,911
X about what this person was expected to do to prepare

138
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:25,311
So there were to be no confusion when they sat down at this deposition chair what you are expected

139
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:31,711
And the judge was laying out these are the minimum requirements

140
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:35,807
This really was an act of generosity on the part of the Court

141
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:37,855
This is the judge from that hearing

142
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:44,511
I think where I'm struggling is actually I actually believe we're most likely to end up in a situation where

143
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:50,911
Where I'm going to be telling the jury we gave the defendants all these opportunities to answer these questions and you may decide

144
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:53,983
Hide from the answers they gave or did not give

145
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:57,311
Have they answered those answers would hurt their case

146
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:59,103
Or some language to that effect

147
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:05,759
I just don't know that we're there today on these issues after one shameful corporate rep

148
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:06,783
Damages

149
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:13,183
That's so you know I would really like to have one corporate deposition where the witness actually prefer

150
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:19,071
Ayers exactly what bill was

151
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:24,447
Where we could have just been right there being like body body no no no no no

152
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:30,847
You can lower this limbo bar to the ground man they are digging below it

153
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,383
I think it's a

154
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,479
Good thing I don't think that the court is being like

155
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:41,343
Well you know maybe we'll give him a chance and they'll comply this time it's more like

156
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,111
Alright

157
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,415
You're probably going to f*** this up

158
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:48,511
Let's be super clear by what you need to do give you one

159
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:54,911
If you can't comply then understand I understand we're just at the stage where you can no longer take

160
00:12:55,167 --> 00:13:01,311
Take these events as individual events and they must be taken in totality and if you've already failed at 16

161
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:04,639
Different attached

162
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,407
Get out

163
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,687
But what you going to do

164
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:13,087
So after that point in this in this hearing the judge goes on to delineate what preparing for these top

165
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:19,487
Topix actually means we're going to periodically refer back to this as we go through Miss past deposition

166
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:25,887
And I assume that's because she Nails it every time. That's correct.

167
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:28,703
Your case is being conducted by Mark Bankston

168
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:35,103
Naturally these are long videos and a lot of information in them Dells into areas that we've been over before

169
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:41,503
I'm going to try to trim a bit of that out and primarily focus on what we can learn from these documents

170
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:48,671
It's important to remember how much Alex wines on his show but not being allowed a chance to defend himself because

171
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:52,255
This exists as definitive evidence that he's full of s***

172
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:58,655
He had already sent Daria to testify as a corporate rep and she showed up with printed out Wikipedia articles

173
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:01,471
No idea about the subject you were supposed to discuss

174
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:06,079
And she ended up kind of supporting Sandy Hook conspiracy theories Underoath

175
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:11,455
A room with a bun dance of Grace the court is giving him another chance to actually participate

176
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:13,503
This is what we get

177
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,271
So

178
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:20,927
Hurrah everybody

179
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:25,279
Position from 14th February 14th covering the Sandy Hook cases

180
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:31,679
And the first thing we're going to establish here at the beginning is how long did you have

181
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,471
To prepare for this

182
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:40,127
And it's given the call on the way here might as well.

183
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:42,175
Stop when were you selected

184
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:51,391
I think that I was officially hired the last week and I'm sorry

185
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:53,695
Give me the last week in January first week in February

186
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:55,743
So January 31st

187
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,023
February 1st ish

188
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,815
That way cuz it's been about

189
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,239
When you say officially and let me backup you understand 32 designation

190
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,007
Filed

191
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,031
Designating you

192
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,311
The corporate representative

193
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,335
What's the last week

194
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:12,895
Wednesday are you aware of that

195
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:15,199
As far as an official selection

196
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,735
That was done well before that

197
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:19,551
I don't I wouldn't say well before that but it wasn't.

198
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:20,575
Before that if it's

199
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,343
By last week

200
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,647
Right so few weeks

201
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,183
Not if you wake

202
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,719
I've only been the corporate rapper

203
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:28,767
I think as of today is

204
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:35,423
Okay but two weeks okay yeah that makes sense you said January 31st February 1st

205
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,191
So

206
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:39,775
That probably was the day when everything got finalized

207
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,823
So this is going to be a bit important

208
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:48,223
Not because of the difference in dates between her official and unofficial selection but because of how much material she was

209
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:49,759
Exit to be conversant about

210
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:53,855
And the window of time that she had from her selection to the date of this deposition

211
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:58,463
In the hearing after darya's deposition the judge asked to Alex's Council quote

212
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:04,607
Do you know who will be designated or there'll be more than one person designated to respond to these topics

213
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,655
The response was quote

214
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:12,287
I will have the answer for that by the end of today and I'm relatively certain they will be more than one person

215
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:19,455
That would have been a good idea and for whatever reason Alex and Free Speech systems decided not to designate more than one per

216
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:25,855
Person they chose to leave this one person Brittany pause to be responsible for answering to all

217
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:29,183
All the questions in both these cases would honestly isn't fair

218
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:36,095
I don't have pity for Miss pause but it would also be dishonest and not recognize that her inability to do her job and he's dead

219
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:39,423
Deposition was part of an intentional choice that Alex made

220
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:43,263
If there's tens of thousands of pages of material to become familiar with

221
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,335
Having one person do that is an act of sabotage

222
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:51,455
Especially when the opportunity was readily available to split the workload up between multiple represent

223
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:58,111
One person with two weeks prep time is not an active cooperation that's that's no good

224
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:01,695
I am going to pay you $30,000

225
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:06,303
To try and get away with the bare minimum of what you can do

226
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:12,703
Well no because the judge is clearly said what the bare minimum is a lot of work

227
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:18,335
I'm hoping for it but at the very least I hired a lawyer this time so people will think I tried sure

228
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:21,407
I think it's more like $30,000

229
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,431
Get Blake

230
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:28,831
Enough to say something I like that sit there while you have the worst time of your life

231
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:38,303
Tell it you know Plaza

232
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:44,191
Room and you're going to feel like an ass whole is it 4:30 grandvale leg really feel it

233
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:49,567
I don't know I don't think I would do it

234
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:55,967
These were two all day all day like

235
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:58,527
Super uncomfortable session so I don't know

236
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:01,599
Maybe maybe are y'all ever higher price on

237
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:08,255
Being miserable for 8 hours straight memory of being in that room with Daria

238
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:13,375
Deposition for her was worse than the first one

239
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,655
Well we'll see

240
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:20,543
So here is them talking about this sort of dynamic about like a can't really

241
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:25,407
Do everything right but you can't look at all

242
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:29,503
To prepare for this deposition did you review every document produced in this litigation

243
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,551
Every single document

244
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,087
No I didn't have you ever

245
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:39,231
I certainly would agree that it's not possible for one person to do it

246
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:40,255
Within the time. Of the stuff

247
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:42,303
It would take multiple people

248
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:47,167
I had a purposes of this deposition if you'd like to

249
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:49,727
Go through the universe of documented I did review

250
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,263
To do that it's not what am I

251
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:54,847
I'm what I'm asking you is if someone wanted or if a company

252
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:56,127
Wanted to prepare itself for

253
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,919
The deposition by reviewing every document

254
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:00,479
Litigation one person in two weeks

255
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,271
One person in two weeks

256
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,831
And the company did not to under

257
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,111
Take steps to make sure that

258
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:08,927
I was the only

259
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:16,607
So already you kind of have this like being against the judge's wishes

260
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:23,263
Because the goal is to have a corporate representative who could speak on all of the matters that were relevant all of the

261
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:27,871
Discovery material that way was handed over and so

262
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:28,895
She can't

263
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:35,295
Impossible to unless you had multiple people and Alex and Infowars chose not to have

264
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:41,695
Have multiple people chose not to follow you already have basically like this

265
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:45,791
Then why can't we all just say okay then like

266
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:47,839
Alright cool we're done

267
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:54,239
Because there's so much weirdness

268
00:19:54,495 --> 00:20:00,127
The just experience of him being like well you only here here's what they

269
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:04,223
The judge gave you a job this was on that you didn't do it the end

270
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:08,319
Here's here's a couple reasons why I'm glad that's not the case

271
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:14,975
One there's a lot of weird stuff we wouldn't have an episode to do

272
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:21,375
Understand

273
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:24,959
Joy these deposition episodes stood for

274
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,775
Second day deposition

275
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:35,199
What ends up happening I can't even begin to explain to you how bizarre

276
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:41,599
Subject matter get and how revealing it is in an accidental way that doesn't seem like

277
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:48,255
It does not seem like the oldest of the Direction This Is Right Bono perspect

278
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:53,119
Because I feel like people are going to assume that we are behind all of this because there's no other explanation

279
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:59,519
I could see where they would be coming from unfortunately or fortunately

280
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:01,311
It is coincidence

281
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:02,847
So

282
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:08,479
There is a expectation that Yoshi look over all of these materials and preparation

283
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:13,343
And it turns out that she couldn't find a certain video and it's weird because

284
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,879
Daria did

285
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:16,159
What is dangerous to do today

286
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,440
Prepare for all the videos that are

287
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:24,352
So I did try to locate all the videos that are meant

288
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:26,400
Okay were you able to do that

289
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:27,424
Not all of them

290
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,008
Available

291
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:32,288
Due to the teapot

292
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:33,568
I don't know that way

293
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:34,336
Have

294
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:36,640
Something cuz I got to

295
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:40,736
One of them that I know that I couldn't find was the videos

296
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:42,016
Specifically relating

297
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:43,808
Addresses

298
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:46,368
Map

299
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,672
The honor

300
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:49,696
The location

301
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:51,744
That was one

302
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,560
Were you aware that the last Corp

303
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:56,608
Gloria Cordova

304
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,656
She was shown the video

305
00:21:59,168 --> 00:21:59,680
Or usual

306
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,776
In terms of preparation you don't know what

307
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:06,336
I wrote her deposition

308
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,944
Let me make sure I get an answer.

309
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:12,736
You think that means you know what

310
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:15,040
I don't think she did very much

311
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,600
I don't think you did either but I do

312
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:18,624
You think Brad reif

313
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:20,160
You know about that

314
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,440
I don't know what Broadway show

315
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:28,608
Shots fired

316
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:35,008
That was a good start as you're starting to win me over right out of the gate

317
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:41,408
Great to experience a moment of shared reality with somebody on that side

318
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:44,736
Looks like a little bit of frankness

319
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:51,136
Pretty pretty unexpected and rare it doesn't last I didn't think so

320
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:57,536
There's a bit of a conversation about what efforts were made to retain evidence potential

321
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:00,608
Evidence in this case

322
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:01,632
And it's it's

323
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:02,912
It's quite

324
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:09,312
Elongated getting some answers

325
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:14,176
Yeah it's here is an answer to question those particularly this is not good

326
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,968
Can you tell me

327
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,760
Can you at least tell me everything free

328
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:19,296
To preserve evidence

329
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:20,576
Tell me when they did it

330
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:26,976
Sure to my knowledge I think that there were efforts

331
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,000
Taken

332
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:28,768
2

333
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:30,560
Produce Olive

334
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:31,840
Emails at work

335
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:35,680
Turn parameters that were given

336
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:37,728
Company 2

337
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:38,752
The email

338
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:40,288
There were certain

339
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,312
Parameter is done

340
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:42,848
Try to

341
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:44,384
Videos

342
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:46,944
Code access

343
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:48,224
The videos

344
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,528
There

345
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:51,296
I believe I

346
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,832
Pet spider earlier that there was a

347
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,112
Third-party come

348
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:55,904
Company that was helping with that although I'm not

349
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,464
Play Blockhead probably

350
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:03,328
I think that

351
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,864
As far as social media goes

352
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:06,912
Thinks that the test

353
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:07,936
Previously

354
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:09,216
Has been not

355
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:10,752
That

356
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,056
Can be accessed

357
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,784
Are you do you also want to know about

358
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:24,832
The finances

359
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,368
The company and the

360
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:28,416
The finances or we just

361
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,184
Now in the

362
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,768
Emails

363
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:33,536
Article

364
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:38,912
Let's deal with that first answer first cuz what I hear you talking about

365
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:41,472
Is the efforts to make the search for the

366
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:44,032
And efforts made to access the

367
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:47,104
A nice sound to me like

368
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,640
Things that we're done

369
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:50,432
To attempt to locate documents

370
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:51,200
Production in

371
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,528
What I didn't hear is about any effort

372
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,552
Reserved

373
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:56,832
Before that

374
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:59,392
Another word you understand if I'm going to go search for doctor

375
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:00,416
Producer

376
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,440
It's important

377
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:02,976
That I preserve those

378
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,000
For that app

379
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:05,280
You understand what I'm saying

380
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:08,608
I do understand what you're saying and I don't

381
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:10,144
Don't think that there's been any

382
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:12,704
Deletion of any of that in

383
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:15,520
So I mean once they were required to be

384
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:16,544
Reduce

385
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:18,848
Through the databases

386
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:22,176
I don't have any reason to believe any of that information

387
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,296
Who's a really bad look right out of the gate

388
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:33,696
Yeah this section of the beginning of a deposition or Mark is trying to get information about efforts that were made by free speech

389
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:39,328
Systems to preserve evidence pertaining to the question

390
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:46,240
Here's what the judge said specifically about the responsibilities that the corporate representative would have regarding matters in

391
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:48,288
Involving preservation of evidence

392
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:49,056
Quote

393
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:55,456
If she shows up again or I'm sure we'll get a new one if new corporate representative that because that's the way it is

394
00:25:55,712 --> 00:26:00,832
That person says I don't know then they will have disregarded the orders I'm making today

395
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:05,184
Your client will violated the orders that I'm making today I don't want

396
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:10,560
I don't know I'm guessing I think maybe or in4 to be a part of the answer at all

397
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:15,936
Did the answer is we destroy everything as fast as we can that I want them to come out and say that

398
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:22,336
It is their answer is we don't care where it comes from so we don't ever create a record they don't need to save

399
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:23,616
That in that way

400
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:26,432
Alex's lawyer responded with just one

401
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:27,712
Understood

402
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:34,368
Already miss pass has stepped in it and it shown that the direct orders of the judge are not being followed weather

403
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:40,000
Negligence in on like unawareness on her part or as a result of Alex's hostility to the process

404
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:42,304
Either way this is the first of the subject

405
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,888
They were given clear instructions on specifically what not to do

406
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:52,288
And they decided to do that exact thing so she didn't say like oh well immediately

407
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:58,688
After a hard drive contain the materials that we have decided could heard us we pour a bunch of acid on it we've burned

408
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:00,480
Down all of our servers

409
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:06,880
We've got holes in the ground where we buried things that you'll never need to know about

410
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:10,464
She just said

411
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:12,512
Really

412
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:17,632
Talk about any specific things that were done to preserve the evidence

413
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:20,960
We searched our inboxes she couldn't

414
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:24,288
I mean yeah but you don't want to just say they didn't

415
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:31,200
That's a real bummer I don't know what the stakes are for her to say that if that's the case

416
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:32,736
This fine

417
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:39,136
I work for the company

418
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:45,536
Can happen you lose your association with Norm pattis omigod I don't have that Norm anymore

419
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:48,096
Open mics I won't be able to do

420
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:54,496
Yeah it is I've been there so there's a lot of

421
00:27:54,752 --> 00:28:00,384
4th and questioning about 20 she talked to from the company and such

422
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:06,016
She didn't try to get in touch with maybe a poor decision on her part

423
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:08,832
Because she was supposed to

424
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:15,744
What you did talk to Alex cuz that might have been a problem cuz I believed him.

425
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:22,144
One person that I found her answer to be very bizarre

426
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,192
Sorry about is curtain demo

427
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:30,592
He was a like senior writer like a managerial editor during some of the relevant

428
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:32,128
Periods for the case

429
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:36,480
And whether or not she tried to contact him

430
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:41,344
Is a super Bazaar thread that goes throughout both deposition

431
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,184
Here's what she says on the 1st deposition

432
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,232
Soperton mou understand he

433
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:53,888
Well I know who he was cuz he's no longer employed by the company but I think

434
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:54,912
Fat in

435
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:55,680
Irrelevant

436
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:56,704
Time. I believe

437
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:57,728
20

438
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:58,752
B18a

439
00:28:59,008 --> 00:28:59,776
And prior he was

440
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:00,800
Head

441
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:01,568
Red Rider

442
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:02,336
Add info

443
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:03,872
You talked to him

444
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,664
I was not able to locate her

445
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,432
Sammy's Auto current

446
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:07,456
But I didn't

447
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:13,088
What do you mean you tried

448
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:13,856
Find out if

449
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:16,416
I just I wasn't able to reach out to him

450
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:17,952
Deposed in life

451
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:21,024
I tried to reach out to

452
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:26,144
Let's make sure I understand

453
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:28,704
Think what I said was

454
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,312
We can maybe need to

455
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:37,664
Is you were unable to

456
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:40,736
I don't know that I was unable to

457
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,272
I think that we

458
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:43,040
Tried

459
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:45,344
By phone

460
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:46,624
So if I go talk

461
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,768
How do you not know

462
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,352
I didn't

463
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:57,120
I wasn't able to

464
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:59,680
I'm not on map that's not what I'm asking you

465
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:00,960
I'm asking did you call him

466
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:04,288
Colorado

467
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:09,152
People I think

468
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:11,456
Your testimony is

469
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:12,992
You were somebody to info

470
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:13,760
Ford called him for

471
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:21,696
I know we tried

472
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:22,720
2

473
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,024
I know we tried

474
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:25,792
2

475
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:27,328
Gaviscon

476
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:28,608
Should I ask Melinda

477
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:35,264
Don't know whether

478
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:36,288
I called him a

479
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:38,080
Pickup

480
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,104
I know I haven't talked to her

481
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:40,640
So I'm not honestly

482
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:43,456
Information

483
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:45,504
Not you are sure you haven't talked to

484
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,808
I am sure I haven't talked to you not sure of his

485
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:48,832
Try to talk

486
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:50,880
I know I asked for his contact

487
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:52,416
But I'm not sure if I asked

488
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:55,744
So this is weird

489
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:02,144
It's splitting hairs in a really really strange way

490
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:07,776
Like straight-up says that you didn't contact a number of people that seen on that pile

491
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:13,664
So I'm going to jump ahead actually to the second days deposition

492
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:18,528
And see how this curtain Mo discussion goes on that day

493
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:24,928
And see if the see if you see any dissimilarity

494
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:27,488
Can't remember if you spoke with pneumonia.

495
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:28,512
I did not speak English

496
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:31,584
Any particular reason

497
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:34,400
I don't I don't know that I

498
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:36,960
Had his information of readily available

499
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:39,008
And I know that I have the time to talk to him

500
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,312
Lot of people did you ask for it

501
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:48,480
Thermistor nomos phone number yes I did ask Melinda for I don't know that she was able to find it

502
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:51,040
I don't I don't think I even got his number

503
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:58,720
Very weird how is I really feel like I've learned so much about deposition through all of

504
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:01,024
And just the concept of just

505
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:07,424
Like they don't even get the idea of answering a question that you can then answer with a follow-up question and

506
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:08,960
Right you know like

507
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:13,824
I think I called them and then they go well if I check his phone records did you call him

508
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:20,480
Eyevac emmymade maybe I called he could have been called in the future I don't know

509
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:22,016
Also I think

510
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:28,416
I don't want to assume what someone would not remember but you know

511
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:34,816
For 2 weeks 2 weeks it's not a very long time to try to remember what efforts have and have not been made

512
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:41,216
Hayden where things stand how many people could you possibly have called right and curtain with somebody who's like

513
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:47,616
A particularly relevant member of the Infowars team 10 he was there

514
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:51,200
To me like it wouldn't be that confusing what happened

515
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:57,600
That's why I'm confused by these answers that seem a little bit different over the to deposition

516
00:32:57,856 --> 00:33:04,000
I mean I think we can assume that was important as when she initially answered the question she said I know who

517
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:05,536
Who Kurt Nemo was

518
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:12,192
So we can assume that she's murdered curtain Nemo it's I think it's them oh he's not a camera

519
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:15,520
Pilot the Nautilus

520
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:21,664
So this makes clip Perez

521
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,200
Troubling about

522
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:24,992
Alex's phones

523
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:32,416
Sheath rectally contradict Alex's own testimony about Alex Azar

524
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:34,464
Don't do that you believe Mister Johnson

525
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,488
Is produced all the text

526
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:36,768
Sandy Hook

527
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,048
He had in his possession

528
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:44,192
And here's the problem that is that I don't know

529
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:45,216
What

530
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:45,984
She has on a

531
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:46,752
This phone

532
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:47,776
Because

533
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:49,056
I don't know

534
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:50,336
What

535
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:51,360
What if any

536
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:53,408
Would have been on the

537
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:54,176
The phone

538
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:55,200
Time.

539
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:57,760
And the reason our only reason why I say that is

540
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:59,040
I know that he's got a new

541
00:33:59,296 --> 00:33:59,808
New phones

542
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,112
So he doesn't have access

543
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:03,136
Yes to anything that's on

544
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:03,904
Prior phone

545
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,208
Uninstall the wires got burners

546
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:06,976
She wouldn't have any

547
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:08,768
For prior phone

548
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:11,584
I'm sure that

549
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:14,400
Well actually

550
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:17,728
But in any event like I said I do

551
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:18,752
I don't know when

552
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:20,032
He would have gotten a new phone

553
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:22,336
She would have access to

554
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:26,176
You read Mister Jones's November 2019

555
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:30,272
I read the March 2019 deposition I don't think I got to the

556
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:33,088
Okay cuz he missed you just testified

557
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:33,856
Something totally office

558
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:35,136
Okay

559
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:36,160
He got new phones

560
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:38,208
But they have the same sim card in a

561
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:38,976
Cloud storage

562
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:39,744
And he doesn't lose

563
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:40,768
Text messages

564
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:41,792
How many reasons

565
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:42,560
Dispute that

566
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,096
Oops

567
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:44,864
Oops

568
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:48,960
I guess I made that excuse up

569
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:50,240
I mean minute ago

570
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:56,640
And the reason is because the context of this is surrounding Mark having a text message

571
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:59,712
That Alex should have on his phone

572
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:01,248
That involve Sandy Hook

573
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:03,040
Yeah it was not produced

574
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:07,904
Because Elizabeth Williamson from The New York Times had reached out to mark

575
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:14,304
That she had a text exchange with Alex that included the words it was not produce

576
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,608
And Discovery is Leeds

577
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:22,752
To suspicion that all the texts were not necessarily turned over

578
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:23,776
Kind of

579
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:30,432
The area where she's trying to wiggle around I mean avoided

580
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:36,320
About to say was I'm sure if he could have returned over all of his text messages he would have

581
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:38,368
And then she stopped herself instead

582
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:39,648
Well I'm not sure what

583
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:44,000
It would be generous to assume that's

584
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:48,864
It's only inability that's stopping him

585
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:55,264
True that

586
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:01,920
A high-stakes gambling table

587
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:05,248
I would bet every time on Alex light

588
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:11,904
So another big chunk a big thing of what this deposition gets into in the early stages

589
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:12,928
Is

590
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:17,792
What awareness did the company have of the plaintiff

591
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,120
I just enjoyed this

592
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:24,192
Can you summarize for me what the company knows about Neil

593
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:28,800
Could you be more specific

594
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:35,712
No no number of times there are

595
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:39,552
Number of instances where she has to be more specific

596
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:41,856
No

597
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:46,464
I will not be more specific. Require

598
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,256
Suspiciously

599
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:54,656
Everything I don't know why I just got here 2 weeks ago and I find out they know everything about this guy

600
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:59,776
We have their DNA on file

601
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:05,408
Specific

602
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:12,064
Has appears to be unaware of what the company knows in specific about

603
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:12,832
Neil Haskell

604
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:16,928
Produce documents

605
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:20,768
That's what it was okay you don't know what the company may have

606
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:21,536
May not have produce

607
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:25,376
Before after the litigation

608
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:30,240
So before the litigation I don't see

609
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:31,008
Think that the company

610
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:33,056
If at all

611
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:35,616
Okay

612
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:36,896
What about after

613
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:41,760
After I am aware that there was some in

614
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:43,296
Nation about

615
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:45,088
Some

616
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:45,856
Legal issues that

617
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:47,136
Coming out of hiding

618
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:48,160
Etiquette

619
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:52,000
You mean after the lawsuit

620
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:57,632
Prior to this loss

621
00:37:58,656 --> 00:37:59,936
In terms of its Sandy Hook coverage

622
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:01,728
The company ever done any research

623
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:09,408
So here we come to strike to internal this deposition ignoring the direct instructions given by the judge

624
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,688
From the hearing

625
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:13,248
Quote the company's knowledge of the plaintiffs

626
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:19,904
Clearly the representative who was that did not even try to determine with a company news and she had no knowledge

627
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:26,048
Documents that were provided by the company she was they represent and the discovery of in these cases

628
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:32,448
So I consider to be the minimum efforts or the corporate representative to review every document produced by the company in the

629
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:34,752
Is litigation prior to their deposition

630
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:41,408
When Daria did her deposition she had no awareness of documents that Free Speech systems had produced relating to their

631
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:42,688
Your knowledge of the plaintiff

632
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:46,528
And so is part of Alex getting another chance to provide a corporate rap

633
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:50,368
They were going to be required to review all the documents that involve the subject

634
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:55,232
This is painfully obvious from this exchange Miss pause did not do that

635
00:38:55,744 --> 00:39:01,888
This is queer specifically as it relates mr. hustling because just as one example deposition

636
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:08,544
The company produced an email to David Knight sent to himself with a subject line quote Connecticut carry releases the truck

637
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,616
Apple passive Neil Flynn from before the lawsuit

638
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:15,968
There's also that email the David Knight sent himself with the subject line quote

639
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:20,576
Neil heslin father of Sandy Hook victims faces criminal charges which he sent to himself

640
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:22,624
One night at 3 in the morning

641
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,160
Before the lawsuits

642
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:30,816
We already have a concrete demonstration the two of the judges specific demands have not been respected and we are not very

643
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:35,936
Far into this thing it is just clear and it's it's

644
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:41,056
Here's the thing that bums me out right I'm a lawyer

645
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:47,456
And I'm hired by Alex Jones and I have been even slightly aware of what's going on

646
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:53,856
The first thing I would have done is read none of the documents and read all of the previous deposition

647
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:58,720
To figure out where it is I should avoid lying in tandem

648
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:05,120
Do you know what I mean like you know there's so many lies going on you got to know what lies you're trying

649
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:11,520
Find a backup you might want to read arya's for cautionary tales

650
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:17,920
But you can discount a lot of like actual factual stuff

651
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:24,320
Think with what Alex said Batman learn from the mistakes of the people who came before you

652
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:30,720
Bring everything with you I'm talking all the other positions

653
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:36,352
Do you mean like in this thing I be like hold on let's take the next

654
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:42,752
Half hour while I find this

655
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:45,056
Adorable home

656
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:51,456
So another issue is whether or not the company had knowledge about Scarlett Lewis

657
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:53,504
Another of the plaintiff

658
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:58,880
Answer there was an email that was how big harassing

659
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:05,280
Does Louis have to do with like why if you were so worried that you stopped to get coffee

660
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:10,912
You know like that that guy that kind of thing brings up the coffee

661
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:11,936
And

662
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:16,032
This is this is sort of Miss pause trying to respond

663
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:21,152
I don't I don't get the sense that she really knows what is being referred to here okay

664
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:23,200
Do you know about the Cod about Scarlett Lewis and

665
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:24,992
The coffee you understand what I mean when I talk about

666
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:25,760
Carl Lewis

667
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:31,392
I believe that I read somewhere that there was something

668
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:33,696
About

669
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:34,976
Miss Louis

670
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:37,536
Was going to

671
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:38,560
Get coffee for

672
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:40,352
Some people that were on

673
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:43,168
Alright so

674
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:44,960
That's a note that somebody gave it come

675
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:45,728
Company about Miss Lewis

676
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:47,520
Release date

677
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:52,384
I think that was in the news cycle

678
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:58,015
Who's your circle

679
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:58,783
That

680
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:00,575
Maybe it could

681
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:01,599
Email wear

682
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:02,623
How big was he

683
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:06,975
I said I don't know that I

684
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:09,535
Did you check

685
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:11,583
Did I talk about that

686
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:16,191
That's not good wow

687
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:22,079
Yeah it's pretty easy to confuse harassing emails with a new cycle you know

688
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:28,479
Yeah you know we've been through this with with Daria and oh my God we've been through this so much

689
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:34,879
30 times and each time you look at it and you see what

690
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:37,183
Two pair of sharks

691
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:40,767
Murdering what's left over of chump right

692
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:42,815
This time it's supposed to be a lawyer

693
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:45,119
It's supposed to be somebody on equal footing

694
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:51,775
She's not there as a legal practice law very very clearly for illegal

695
00:42:56,383 --> 00:43:02,527
Sure and I do think that because of that she does and position a little bit better

696
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:07,391
The number of instances been someone like Dario Rob do what

697
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:14,047
But yeah it's it's it's I think it's very different for that reason that she has a familiarity with

698
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:19,423
The law and then second because she's not part of Infowars

699
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:23,007
She is an outside agent who's being like

700
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:25,055
I'm a Hired Gun here

701
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:28,127
I don't know why you would

702
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:34,527
Just be like I don't know honestly

703
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:40,927
Think it's still feels like she's trying to make stuff up in order to explain away things in a way

704
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:47,327
Play that serves no one's purposes happy because of this it's not helping him it's not helping you and it's not helping

705
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:50,911
They talked a bit about what she's being compensated

706
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:52,959
And it is a flat rate

707
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:59,359
According to her there's not like if she works extra time than she expected and she's not billing for extra

708
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:00,383
Hours

709
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:06,783
There's no implication that there's some kind of a bonus it did they could be itchy

710
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:10,111
It seems very bizarre to me

711
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:10,879
That

712
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:11,647
Cheese

713
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:18,047
Acting this I mean just scorched-earth honest that it would astonish people

714
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:24,447
That's the only way that you would do it there is literally no reason why is she would not get as familiar as you can

715
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:28,287
These subjects and that everything that she did and just be like I don't know

716
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:34,687
I have no idea I was not able to prepare on this

717
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:41,855
We're all f***** here let's do what we can do and then I mean barking Bill both

718
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:46,207
Various points Express something of the eye

719
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:52,863
I empathize with the position that you are in this is not something that anybody could do but I'm sick of this s***

720
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:59,263
Sorry I have a big energy of me on the phone with someone from

721
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:00,031
Xfinity

722
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:01,055
You know like

723
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:07,455
Yeah I'm not mad at you it could be a scarecrow sitting where you are sorry I'm coming for that f******

724
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:13,855
Scarecrow okay so sorry that you are talking to me right now cuz I hate your Phelps personally hurt

725
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:20,255
I don't even know you but guess what company sucks and I have to I have to let you know about a really tear you apart

726
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:26,655
Yeah there is a bit of that discussion comes up about Scarlett Lewis

727
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:29,471
And this is really I found this fascinating

728
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:31,775
There is a

729
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:34,591
I want to get on the record

730
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:37,407
Whether or not the company believes

731
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:40,479
These plaintiffs to be gun-control Advocates right

732
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:46,879
Because that's a lot of the justification that Alex has for treating them the way he did

733
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:53,279
Activist there in the public eye or whatever his argument is yes of course the political route

734
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:56,607
I'm so Miss Lewis has a charity

735
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:00,447
I have this exchange is truly bizarre

736
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:03,263
Do does the company Canton Ms Lewis is it going to rain

737
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:10,431
I think I miss Lewis

738
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:11,199
Operates

739
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:11,967
A non-profit

740
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:12,735
Organization

741
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:13,503
And I believe I do

742
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:15,039
Material in the

743
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:15,807
Disclosure

744
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:16,831
Discovery material

745
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:18,367
Operates

746
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:20,415
Offer

747
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:25,535
Amazon

748
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:26,559
What guns

749
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:30,399
You don't know what to do

750
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:36,031
Don't

751
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:36,799
Know what

752
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:37,823
He says it Abby

753
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:38,847
For butt

754
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:40,383
I know that there are deaf

755
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:41,919
Haitians as

756
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:42,943
What

757
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:46,015
I just want to put

758
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:49,855
You seem to be trying to insinuate

759
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:51,647
That there was a potential interpret

760
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:52,927
Miss Lewis's chair

761
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:55,999
Some way

762
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:58,047
This is that accurate

763
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:00,607
I don't know but what I'm saying is

764
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:01,375
Is she operates

765
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:02,399
Nonprofit that

766
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:03,679
Prophet has

767
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:05,471
A goal and ask

768
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:06,239
Stated

769
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:07,263
Directive

770
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:09,823
And however anyone wants

771
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:11,359
To interpret that

772
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:12,127
Is a matter of a

773
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:12,895
Canyon

774
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:15,199
But she operates a non-profit

775
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:15,967
Charity

776
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:17,247
I get that

777
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:23,647
So we have a set up here miss pause is trying to like painted like what

778
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:30,815
You know whatever to make up your own ideas of school safety

779
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:32,351
What is that about other than

780
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:38,751
Literally no way to find out what a charity spends its money on and is to

781
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:43,103
Trying to do they have they've some regulations about that recording

782
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:46,943
But you don't even have to go that far because it is next clip

783
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:52,575
Misbah has learned in real-time what this charity is about and then

784
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:53,855
Has to Pivot

785
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:58,463
Oh my God what is wrong with Andre

786
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:05,119
I'm personally am I sitting here today saying that she's a gun-control Advocate know but what I'm saying is I say

787
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:05,887
I think that

788
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:10,495
The host and writers at infowar in their opinion

789
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:12,543
Would interpret that is be

790
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:13,567
Bingo controller

791
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:14,591
Do they

792
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:20,223
Individually as individual writers and individual host I can testify as to whether

793
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:22,015
Let's just testified the new with the

794
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:23,551
Sure

795
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:24,319
Machine gun control

796
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:25,855
The company can't

797
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:30,719
I understand I'm going to trial

798
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:34,815
I need to discover what the company is or is not going to argue about

799
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:37,887
Intentions are

800
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:39,679
I think it's fair.

801
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:41,471
Benefit companies going to

802
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:42,239
Intense garlic

803
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:44,543
I get to know that

804
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:46,847
I think it is a reasonable

805
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:48,895
Interpretation

806
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:49,663
Of

807
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:50,687
Nonprofit

808
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:53,247
Central advocate

809
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:54,527
A host

810
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:55,807
Or a writer

811
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:57,087
Wanted to

812
00:48:57,343 --> 00:48:59,135
Argue that from that angle

813
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:00,415
I think it's a reasonable in

814
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:01,439
Irritation

815
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:02,463
Of that

816
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:03,231
Tivity

817
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:05,791
Of the activity of her charity

818
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:06,559
Yes

819
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:07,583
Emotional

820
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:08,607
Intelligence

821
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:10,399
If that's what

822
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:13,471
Okay so first of all you have no idea

823
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:16,799
I'm not on any independent research on

824
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:19,103
So in terms of asking

825
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:22,175
What the company contends Miss Scarlett Lewis

826
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:23,711
Does with her charity

827
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:24,991
In terms of what it.

828
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:30,111
I know what she says it what does

829
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:31,903
Okay what is the company

830
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:33,695
Know that Miss Lewis says it

831
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:36,511
What she says it does is advocate

832
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:37,279
4

833
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:39,839
Advocate for

834
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:42,911
Safe space for children to express

835
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:43,679
Themselves

836
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:45,727
How could that be

837
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:48,031
Like I said it.

838
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:48,799
Depends on the opinion

839
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:50,847
You were the one who said it could

840
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:52,383
Tell me how

841
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:54,175
How how can

842
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:55,967
School safety Beacon

843
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:58,783
Construed as gun-control advocacy

844
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:00,831
If that's in fact what it does

845
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:03,135
You're the one who just told me that one

846
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:05,695
What I told you that is what

847
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:07,487
Company.

848
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:10,815
I don't know whether that is an actual statement

849
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:16,191
A factor might be something surreptitious

850
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:19,775
I don't know I haven't done any

851
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:21,311
Now I get it

852
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:24,639
I'm sorry I was I was having trouble because I would

853
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:25,663
Thinking that

854
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:29,503
The company's knowledge about what Miss Lewis does you were taking the suicide a word

855
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:32,575
But because the company can't verify that and has done nothing to her

856
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:34,111
You can say

857
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:35,903
Alright

858
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:42,303
Amazing weird thing to agree to at the end

859
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:45,887
This and you've done nothing to try you've decided to be suspicious

860
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:52,287
Yes yep you got it that's a company baby I think the clip does a really good job illustrate

861
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:58,175
Creating this kind of amateurish improv that Miss Paws is having to make it through the deposition

862
00:50:58,431 --> 00:51:04,575
She has no idea what Miss Lewis's charity is about but she thinks it has to do with school safety in a way that you could imply that it's

863
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:06,111
Secretly about gun control

864
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:10,207
It's something that people could have different opinions on depending on your interpretation

865
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:16,863
And then after going away is down that road she learns that it's actually a charity about fostering emotional intelligence and Young

866
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:20,959
Students she's forced to stick with that premise that she's already established

867
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:24,799
I know she's left with an unfortunate and I'm comfortable decision

868
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:30,687
Either admit that you had no idea what you was talking about was making up assessments that she made earlier

869
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:37,087
Or she has to stick to her guns and implied this charity that's about teaching the core values of like kindness and forgiveness

870
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:40,927
Is secretly a gun-control front that Miss Lewis is being dishonest about right

871
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:46,815
You can hear Mark kind of laughing periodically in this and it's because of things like this feels like

872
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:52,703
Even at this point he's pretty sure this deposition is going to be productive and likely is going to lead to more sanctions

873
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:53,471
Ivy

874
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:59,359
Are the other head I feel like I could really a f****** Dale this what it just did like listen

875
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:04,479
Okay you teach kids emotional intelligence they grow up to be emotionally intelligent people

876
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:08,831
Why are they buying guns if everybody's emotionally intelligent Elgin

877
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:15,231
Nobody's buying guns I think that would be hard in a situation where you have follow-up question

878
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:21,631
If you're Alex being a demagogue

879
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:28,031
Call David I could rattle those off

880
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:34,431
What's the Second Amendment for if nobody trying to kill each other

881
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:39,295
Solutely the ultimate gun grab

882
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:44,415
A shift over to Leonard Posner and

883
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:51,071
On behalf of the company must pause

884
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:52,351
There we go

885
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:54,143
How does a company today feel

886
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:55,679
About the fact that it

887
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:56,959
Disclosing this kind of information

888
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:03,615
I think that mr. Posner is

889
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:05,407
Is an activist him anyways

890
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:06,431
I think that

891
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:08,735
Is company

892
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:10,015
Is

893
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:12,063
Engaged

894
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:13,087
Political speech

895
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:17,183
A public

896
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:18,463
Company that could

897
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:19,487
Commented on

898
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:21,023
What politic

899
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:22,047
What we mean

900
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:23,327
Etiology

901
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:25,375
Of mr. off of Honor

902
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:26,911
Sure

903
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:28,447
Company's position

904
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:29,215
Is that he's a

905
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:30,239
Engaged in

906
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:31,519
First Amendment activist

907
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:40,223
That's one of the instances where like if I heard that thank you would be like oh I just said something is

908
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:46,623
The reviews for the company's position is that he's engaged in Auntie First Amendment activity and you said thank you

909
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:50,719
I don't think that's good no I think that's probably is going to look bad

910
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:57,119
Yeah they're I mean yeah part of my goal if I was doing this would be to be played or quoted the

911
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:59,167
East in the trial

912
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:05,567
Like I want to be my name should be mentioned the fewest number of times that's my goal that your goal is to make it so

913
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:11,967
Alright maybe we'll go back to the Daria deposition

914
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:14,271
I could hear that.

915
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:20,927
There was a news report that Infowars covered

916
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:22,207
Shooting in Pakistan

917
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:26,047
And there were children who were killed and

918
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:30,911
There was a memorial that included a picture of mr. Posner son

919
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:37,311
Answer mother victims of of shootings along with pictures of the

920
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:38,847
Victims of this shooting

921
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:45,247
Evans was reported by Infowars as this kid has died again

922
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:50,879
Conversation about whether or not Alex would have known that covering that

923
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:57,279
That way would have been defensive in the past you think the answer would be very ReSound and yes of

924
00:54:57,535 --> 00:54:59,583
Course obviously

925
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:03,423
The emails that we were referring to earlier on about

926
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:04,959
Mr. Posner

927
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:06,495
Communicating

928
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:07,263
His death

929
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:08,031
Displeasure with

930
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:08,799
But the coverage

931
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:11,359
We're not responded to by Miss

932
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:12,127
Esther Jones

933
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:13,663
They were responded to by other

934
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:17,503
Are people I don't know what mr. Jones knew or didn't know about me

935
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:18,783
Mr. Posner

936
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:20,575
Indication of displeasure at the

937
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:22,879
Time because you didn't read the stuff is

938
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:24,927
Position right where you talk

939
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:28,255
Assuming that I will also say

940
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:29,279
That

941
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:30,303
This

942
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:32,607
Is not altogether on

943
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:33,631
Common where are you

944
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:36,191
Source another article

945
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:36,959
And

946
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:39,519
Publish the article I don't know that nests

947
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:40,287
Thoroughly

948
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:41,823
This is an adoption by me

949
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:42,591
Esther Jones

950
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:43,359
Of what the

951
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:49,247
Call Heart of the article and I was about to say will you know it is cuz you watch the video but you didn't watch TV

952
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:53,855
New York

953
00:55:54,111 --> 00:55:54,623
I'm sorry

954
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:55,647
Yes I don't want

955
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:58,207
Okay because mr. Jones says in this video

956
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:01,279
32 the Pakistan thing is fake and Sandy Hooks

957
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:02,303
Things fake one of these half

958
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:04,351
You know he said that

959
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:06,143
I don't know I didn't

960
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:16,639
We have yet another instance of a very clear and direct refusal of Alex's team to follow the judges

961
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:18,687
Instructions in preparing for the deposition

962
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:20,735
From the judge at that hearing

963
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:24,831
Quote they should watch every video in the weeks leading up to the deposition

964
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:31,231
They should identify themselves for the company every statement they believe in those videos has a source and they should make

965
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:33,535
Efforts to determine what that Source was

966
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:35,583
And they should be able to intelligently

967
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:40,703
Intelligently as to the source of that effort they've taken to determine those sources

968
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:47,359
What are very basic level this is just a failure and Miss pause didn't watch the video they're talking about you can see

969
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:48,383
This makes her

970
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:54,783
Unable to answer questions about its content let alone further questions about its sourcing just

971
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:56,063
There's nowhere to go

972
00:56:56,319 --> 00:57:00,927
Yeah that listed is that list of things from the judge is now taking on more of like a

973
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:06,559
I want a pony and I want world peace and I want yeah that's not happening

974
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:10,655
Talking about it as like

975
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:15,263
Impossible tasks like world peace and a pony

976
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:18,079
Anybody from Infowars to tell the truth

977
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:21,151
But that's because of

978
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:22,175
Who you're asking

979
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:25,247
It's like

980
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:28,575
The request isn't some kind of a like

981
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:30,879
Idealistic

982
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:37,023
Sure impossible to deliver in any other case this is the sort of requirement that would be

983
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:43,423
You're asking the wind for information

984
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:49,823
Man the info Infowars is a force of nature towards this court I understand

985
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:53,407
Like the request is for World Peace implies that like

986
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:59,807
URI or anybody else who's in this position being sued would be unable to find a way to

987
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:01,599
Comply with the court

988
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:03,647
Prison reality it's just like

989
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:04,927
It's not it's like

990
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:06,975
Requiring a chocolate bar

991
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:13,375
From someone who is staunchly refuses to admit the chocolate exist

992
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:15,679
To get that candy bar

993
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:22,079
It is very very attainable request that the court is making of Alex but it is

994
00:58:22,591 --> 00:58:24,383
It just feels like it's impossible

995
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:28,991
Because they are making it impossible for either non-compliant force of nature

996
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:35,903
So there is the whole thing about her son

997
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:37,183
Image

998
00:58:37,695 --> 00:58:39,487
Traces back to

999
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:40,767
And has to do with

1000
00:58:41,279 --> 00:58:47,423
The copyright strikes right that he was filing on these conspiracy videos in order to get them

1001
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:53,823
Strikes on YouTube going to take anything season and advocate for the end of the fur

1002
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:55,103
First Amendment

1003
00:58:55,359 --> 00:59:00,735
In one of these videos Alex has copyright claim

1004
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:06,367
Answer this this is something that is asked of his paws what's going on here

1005
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:10,719
It says he showed a copyright claim document on camera

1006
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:12,255
Do you know what that refers to

1007
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:16,863
I think it probably refers to

1008
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:17,631
Mister

1009
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:18,655
Posner

1010
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:19,935
To get

1011
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:21,215
Videos

1012
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:21,983
Removed

1013
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:22,751
Are you

1014
00:59:23,007 --> 00:59:24,287
Do you know that or is that just

1015
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:28,127
I think that that's what

1016
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:28,895
True

1017
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:31,455
But I'll be done anything to figure that out now

1018
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:32,735
So that document

1019
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:34,783
Pigeon for Mena

1020
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:38,367
On the first year now we're going to know now we're going to the one that says 924

1021
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:39,647
Keep going

1022
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:42,207
You see the Bates number 92

1023
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:46,303
And on this page on segments for

1024
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:50,911
It also talks about showed copyright claim document on camera

1025
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:52,703
If this is

1026
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:56,031
The complaint or some sort of complaint from Mr Posner

1027
00:59:57,311 --> 00:59:58,591
You haven't done anything to located

1028
00:59:58,847 --> 00:59:59,359
Figure out what it is

1029
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:00,639
No but

1030
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:02,431
What this means to me is that

1031
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:03,711
During the segment

1032
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:04,735
He showed the app

1033
01:00:04,991 --> 01:00:05,503
Actual

1034
01:00:05,759 --> 01:00:06,527
On his document

1035
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:08,319
On his document

1036
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:09,343
Exactly

1037
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:17,791
Just like the thank you exactly

1038
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:24,191
The judges direct orders from the hearing to be able to speak about everything Alex Jones

1039
01:00:24,447 --> 01:00:30,079
Leave those videos about every piece of paper he holds up every piece of paper you shows on that desk camera

1040
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:33,919
So specifically things are shown on the desk

1041
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:37,247
So clearly this requirement has not been satisfied

1042
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:41,087
Ironically I was listening to this I was thinking

1043
01:00:41,343 --> 01:00:47,487
I think I would be one of the few people in the world who could actually do a decent job as the corporate housing

1044
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:53,887
Yeah they should have paid you way more than 30 grand and you decry ronnica Lee I think I could answer most of the

1045
01:00:55,679 --> 01:01:01,823
The f****** he'll turn moment of Mark sitting at a deposition desk

1046
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:05,663
Did you walk and get at the corporate representative few should have a f******

1047
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:08,991
World championship belt on.

1048
01:01:09,247 --> 01:01:15,391
McMahon and Austin hugging in the ring a WrestleMania the end of an era

1049
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:24,095
I don't know why she's not lying about the things that would make her look like a reasonable eye you know like did you look

1050
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:30,495
Look into this listen it was on my list of things to look into but there were a million things to look into you know it and I know it wasn't

1051
01:01:30,751 --> 01:01:32,799
Possible for me to look into this is like

1052
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:35,359
Nope didn't give a f*** about this one next

1053
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:41,759
Functionally I'm not sure there's that much difference but it is different

1054
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:48,159
So one of the things that I think will plague every one

1055
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:54,559
One who has any familiarity with this case until the day they died is a fact that there was that ridiculously in-depth

1056
01:01:54,815 --> 01:02:00,191
Gigantic background-check of Leonard Posner documents that were handed over by

1057
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:06,591
Alex and his is company and no one seems to know what the fuc

1058
01:02:06,847 --> 01:02:07,359
Yep

1059
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:10,431
Can you summarize any other information the company has about me

1060
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:14,015
How does we sit here today

1061
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:18,111
I have CNA background checks that was

1062
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:18,879
Is produced in

1063
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:20,159
Production

1064
01:02:20,415 --> 01:02:21,951
Okay tell me about that word.com

1065
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:26,815
You know interesting Lee enough I cannot determine where that came from

1066
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:35,007
Through alright mark it is

1067
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:41,407
Everyone has no idea where it came from

1068
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:47,807
Vicious in the uniformity of no one knowing anything about that

1069
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:53,951
Jordan is an Unsolved Mysteries

1070
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:55,999
When you understood that. Backgrounds

1071
01:02:56,511 --> 01:02:57,023
Report exist

1072
01:02:57,279 --> 01:02:58,047
What did you do to me

1073
01:03:00,095 --> 01:03:00,607
So

1074
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:02,911
I have spoken to Mr

1075
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:04,447
George Jones I've spoken

1076
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:07,263
Esther do I've tried to go

1077
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:08,287
Through the

1078
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:10,591
Material in the emails to find out if it was

1079
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:12,383
Email I don't

1080
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:14,175
It connected to an email

1081
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:17,503
Mr. Jones not aware of where it came from

1082
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:19,551
Is Urdu is not aware where I came from

1083
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:20,319
I can

1084
01:03:21,087 --> 01:03:21,855
Calculate but I don't want

1085
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:22,623
Why do that

1086
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:23,647
Cuz I don't honestly

1087
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:24,415
We know where it came

1088
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:26,463
I do know it is amongst

1089
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:28,767
The materials in the production but I can

1090
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:30,559
Can't testify as to when

1091
01:03:31,071 --> 01:03:32,095
When or how

1092
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:34,655
Somebody put it in there right

1093
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:36,447
I don't know how it came

1094
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:39,007
I know that I know you don't know.

1095
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:40,287
But somebody put it in

1096
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:47,199
Dad has gotten there somehow exactly

1097
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:53,599
Conversation that happens in like the front office of a medical room that just be like

1098
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:55,903
You know these things happen what you going to do

1099
01:03:56,159 --> 01:04:02,303
Believe scissors inside somebody

1100
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:10,751
Yeah it's I mean there is an answer to the question and it's frustrating that

1101
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:17,663
It's entirely possible that no one because it's within our grasp though it is it is

1102
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:21,759
The knowable thing it seems like it should be

1103
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:28,159
I guess one of the ways they could be figured out I don't know how I don't know if this is even possible

1104
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:30,463
If you need like a court order or something but like

1105
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:35,583
Obviously the background check would have had to been run by somebody

1106
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:38,655
You might have some record of who did it

1107
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:43,263
Is that maybe I don't know but yet is it at this point

1108
01:04:43,775 --> 01:04:49,407
It's absurd absurd you can't have a background check like that and then just have

1109
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:51,711
15 depositions where everybody's like

1110
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:54,783
No no idea never heard of it.

1111
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:58,367
Another thing that's bizarre is this clip

1112
01:04:58,879 --> 01:05:00,671
They understand his protective order in this case

1113
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:02,207
And I haven't seen

1114
01:05:02,463 --> 01:05:03,231
Assigned

1115
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:04,255
Protective order

1116
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:07,583
But I'm happy to do it

1117
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:08,607
Okay

1118
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:11,167
But in other words before being exposed to my client

1119
01:05:16,543 --> 01:05:22,687
That's really f***** up

1120
01:05:22,943 --> 01:05:29,087
You're supposed to have signed entry into that protective order before you accept

1121
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:34,207
Before me and Mark to talk about anything

1122
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:35,999
Anything with this case

1123
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:38,047
And I did

1124
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:42,655
Signed one that's why I couldn't talk about or didn't want to even

1125
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:43,679
High risk

1126
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:50,079
Any possible questions coming up or any conversations that might come up and talk about me going to be at

1127
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:51,103
The deposition

1128
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:53,663
For a couple months afterwards

1129
01:05:54,175 --> 01:05:57,247
But there was no public conversation of any of this stuff because

1130
01:05:57,503 --> 01:06:01,855
I was signed on to this protective order considered was just not signing it

1131
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:04,927
It seems like such a massive

1132
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:11,327
Failure of you could have just not done it apparently

1133
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:13,375
I mean I'm there are no rules

1134
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:18,495
I mean I think that this is a good Rule and I'm happy to be bound by any but if other people aren't but like

1135
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:21,311
I feel like the fact that it exists

1136
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:26,687
And they have the person who has made it all the way to the sitting in the deposition without having

1137
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:28,223
This

1138
01:06:29,247 --> 01:06:31,551
It's it's troubling and maybe

1139
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:37,951
Problem in a case where the honor System is not one that can be

1140
01:06:38,207 --> 01:06:38,975
Relied upon

1141
01:06:39,231 --> 01:06:41,535
I would say it's the least

1142
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:42,303
Yeah yeah

1143
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:46,399
Sysco business weird I don't really know how to set it up

1144
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:47,679
Just weird

1145
01:06:48,447 --> 01:06:50,239
YouTube video on here it starts with

1146
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:51,263
Professor claims

1147
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:55,871
Okay and then I see you taking some notes over to the side right

1148
01:06:57,663 --> 01:07:00,735
Yes but like I said this is just my basic bullet point

1149
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:03,039
Clip of what that video is about

1150
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:04,319
And then I have more in-depth

1151
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:07,391
Okay so one of the notes that you've taken on that video

1152
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:09,439
First you tell me the date on that video

1153
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:13,279
110 2013

1154
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:15,583
Owen Shroyer

1155
01:07:17,887 --> 01:07:18,399
Yeah

1156
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:19,679
Tell me what that means

1157
01:07:21,215 --> 01:07:25,823
It might have been Owen was either in that video or did the interview

1158
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:27,871
Or

1159
01:07:28,895 --> 01:07:29,663
Something to that effect

1160
01:07:30,431 --> 01:07:32,735
Or maybe it was the source for the information or something

1161
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:35,807
No I don't think I would have been the source it would have been

1162
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:37,343
The person who is

1163
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:38,623
Is doing the video

1164
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:40,159
But

1165
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:43,231
I could be mistaken on that can I check my more in-depth nose

1166
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:52,703
Yeah so for that video

1167
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:56,543
I have the reporter as Owen Shroyer

1168
01:07:57,311 --> 01:07:59,359
I'm his Source was Jim Tracy and

1169
01:07:59,615 --> 01:08:00,127
His

1170
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:02,175
Website for various others

1171
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:05,759
I have I'm a little concerned about that answer

1172
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:08,831
Okay because Owen forward and start working in Fort Worth 2020

1173
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:10,111
Toyota

1174
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:15,743
I did so you know what might might be a typo

1175
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:23,679
Okay she mixed up Paul Joseph Watson and Troyer

1176
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:27,519
Britain and it appears that this is dick butt

1177
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:33,919
It appears that you have drawn Nick but is this Owen Shroyer that you're talking about

1178
01:08:34,431 --> 01:08:38,783
Get hired as big but until

1179
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:42,879
Yeah that's is troubling Wild

1180
01:08:43,135 --> 01:08:49,279
It shows at least an illustration that some of the information that you may

1181
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:52,351
Is inaccurate

1182
01:08:52,607 --> 01:08:54,399
Completely you're just

1183
01:08:54,655 --> 01:08:55,423
Off Script

1184
01:08:55,935 --> 01:09:02,079
This is Outta control there's never going to be any Clarity nobody's just going to come out and be

1185
01:09:02,335 --> 01:09:02,847
Honest

1186
01:09:03,615 --> 01:09:08,479
I don't think that this is a moment of dishonesty

1187
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:12,319
Even if you are telling the truth trying as hard as you can

1188
01:09:12,575 --> 01:09:18,207
There is reason at least to believe that there are instances of you have just got it wrongly the wrong

1189
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:18,975
So

1190
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:25,631
Blah here we go talk about our old friend someone we haven't heard

1191
01:09:25,887 --> 01:09:27,423
Much about in a while

1192
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:29,471
Where am I going to do

1193
01:09:29,727 --> 01:09:31,263
Claim that they Boulder was a house

1194
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:32,799
I got rid of it.

1195
01:09:33,055 --> 01:09:33,823
Not only

1196
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:36,639
That's not a claim that was just meeting at video

1197
01:09:36,895 --> 01:09:39,199
I'm sure that it was made another videos

1198
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:41,247
So I've watched other videos I have

1199
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:42,527
Change this

1200
01:09:44,063 --> 01:09:44,831
Of the house being

1201
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:45,599
Bulldozed

1202
01:09:45,855 --> 01:09:46,367
Okay

1203
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:48,159
Would you like to talk about that

1204
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:50,463
This house being bulldozed

1205
01:09:50,975 --> 01:09:54,559
You mean where did Alex Jones get the beliefs at the house

1206
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:55,583
Right

1207
01:09:55,839 --> 01:09:57,887
I believe that there were property records

1208
01:09:58,143 --> 01:09:58,911
Is that had end

1209
01:09:59,167 --> 01:09:59,679
Indicated that

1210
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:00,447
The house was

1211
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:01,727
Have you seen those

1212
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:02,495
I haven't seen

1213
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:07,103
They were monks

1214
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:07,871
Stop.

1215
01:10:09,407 --> 01:10:11,711
Are do you understand the story that was that

1216
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:14,271
Is this video covers a story by Lee Ann McAdoo

1217
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:15,807
Do you understand that story

1218
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:16,831
Sure

1219
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:18,879
Okay you know who Leanne McAdoo is

1220
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:20,927
She's somebody whose work is feature

1221
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:24,255
You talk to her

1222
01:10:27,327 --> 01:10:33,471
About Adam Lanza's house direct contact

1223
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:36,287
Another admission of failure to follow basic instructions

1224
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:42,687
Mistresses admitting that she is aware of the claim that they're discussing relies on reporting done by Lee Ann McAdoo

1225
01:10:42,943 --> 01:10:45,247
But that she didn't try to contact Leanne

1226
01:10:45,503 --> 01:10:47,807
From the judges directions quote

1227
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:54,207
They need to search for every person quoted in each video and by that I mean they need to search every single thing info

1228
01:10:54,463 --> 01:11:00,607
Wars are free speech systems are out in email on a text

1229
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:06,495
Any other communication system or in the mind of any employee or former employee or guest of the show

1230
01:11:06,751 --> 01:11:08,287
Anything and everything

1231
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:12,895
Was a little bit wishy-washy but whether or not she

1232
01:11:13,151 --> 01:11:14,943
Call door tried to call curtain MO

1233
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:19,039
Here it's pretty direct that you didn't even try to contact Leanne and us

1234
01:11:19,295 --> 01:11:25,183
She didn't make the simplest effort attempt at trying to figure out what the reporting relied on

1235
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:31,583
Which was then used as the basis for Alex to report on what he did and it's impossible to untangle the sourcing because you did

1236
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:33,631
Amazing just

1237
01:11:34,143 --> 01:11:36,447
Just that moment of pure comedy

1238
01:11:36,703 --> 01:11:37,983
You know just that

1239
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:40,543
So did you try and reach out to her

1240
01:11:40,799 --> 01:11:44,383
Just at the break cheery tone of voice that came with us

1241
01:11:44,639 --> 01:11:50,783
Didn't even try that might be also a part of her growing annoyance

1242
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:52,319
Absolutely

1243
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:58,975
Both of them get a bit more annoyed

1244
01:11:59,231 --> 01:12:00,255
For this to go well

1245
01:12:00,511 --> 01:12:06,655
No she doesn't have enough information to do a good job no she doesn't have any information

1246
01:12:06,911 --> 01:12:13,055
Working as a sort of Uno part-time employee temporary employee for someone with a

1247
01:12:13,311 --> 01:12:16,127
Vested interest in not doing a good job

1248
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:19,967
So it's it's chaotic

1249
01:12:20,735 --> 01:12:25,087
Here's another violation of the judge's orders

1250
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:27,391
Do you know what employees were involved in creating the video

1251
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:30,719
Unless it's on that list that we

1252
01:12:30,975 --> 01:12:31,743
If previously marked

1253
01:12:48,127 --> 01:12:49,151
So this is exhibits

1254
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:50,175
Sex

1255
01:12:50,687 --> 01:12:51,199
October 20th

1256
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:55,295
No that's not one of the

1257
01:12:57,087 --> 01:12:58,623
So in other words you want be able to tell me

1258
01:12:58,879 --> 01:12:59,903
When employees were involved

1259
01:13:00,927 --> 01:13:02,719
Now these days go from 2013

1260
01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:06,303
So once again from the judge

1261
01:13:06,559 --> 01:13:12,447
They need to be prepared to identify and describe the role of every employee involved with every video

1262
01:13:13,215 --> 01:13:19,359
So yeah we went on that one too including some exam

1263
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:25,759
Apples that are pretty transparent and obvious of the it like times that the judges direct instruction

1264
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:32,159
There are so many more of them but it would just get repetitive

1265
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:35,487
Really either it's not like

1266
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:41,887
There are 100 examples of her being prepared at like I can't talk about this and then I just chose

1267
01:13:42,143 --> 01:13:44,191
One that was no good

1268
01:13:44,447 --> 01:13:45,983
This is just a rank

1269
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:48,543
Inability to do the thing

1270
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:50,079
That you're there to do

1271
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:51,615
In

1272
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:55,455
Serve opposition to the direct orders that the judge gave

1273
01:13:55,711 --> 01:14:00,063
Write establish why this was happening in the first place

1274
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:03,647
A bummer pitching machine to the judges balls

1275
01:14:03,903 --> 01:14:06,463
That might as well be what we're talking about

1276
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:12,863
But it does allow for you know those opportunities for things to be said there could be

1277
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:14,655
Traveling like

1278
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:21,055
You know it's a company's position that Leonard Posner was opposed to the First Amendment

1279
01:14:21,311 --> 01:14:26,175
Didn't past depositions things like Daria saying on behalf of the company that

1280
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:32,575
Wolfgang halbig sounds like a committed Porter

1281
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:38,975
Is what he does or saying dhanbad and he's a good reporter what's wrong with

1282
01:14:39,231 --> 01:14:45,375
Reporter actually another of those

1283
01:14:45,631 --> 01:14:50,239
And it's trying to argue that

1284
01:14:50,495 --> 01:14:56,639
When Owen got on air and said the things that he did that were defamatory towards mystery

1285
01:14:56,895 --> 01:14:59,967
That he wasn't relying on

1286
01:15:00,223 --> 01:15:05,599
Jim Fetzer who was the underlying information source of the claims

1287
01:15:06,367 --> 01:15:11,999
He was relying on zerohedge right because they've published the article right that Mr fencers information was in

1288
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:14,559
And then

1289
01:15:14,815 --> 01:15:16,095
This is crystallized

1290
01:15:16,351 --> 01:15:22,495
I would say that the reliability of mr. Shroyer is not on the surface or it's on the reporting

1291
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:23,263
Zerohedge

1292
01:15:24,799 --> 01:15:30,175
I do know I didn't have in publishing the article would have netted the

1293
01:15:32,735 --> 01:15:34,015
How do you know that

1294
01:15:34,271 --> 01:15:35,807
Because Infowars entire Pro

1295
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:38,367
Commentating like I said

1296
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:41,695
It does like a citizen blogger commentator

1297
01:15:41,951 --> 01:15:45,279
Paulette whatever okay so we're not doing independent

1298
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:46,815
Independent analysis

1299
01:15:47,071 --> 01:15:50,399
Independent journalism or I'm not investigating me things we're not

1300
01:15:50,655 --> 01:15:51,935
Investigative reporters

1301
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:55,007
Oh boy pulling other articles from the internet

1302
01:15:55,263 --> 01:16:01,407
Those people are writing their articles we've seen those but those sources have been reliable in the past and we are relying

1303
01:16:01,663 --> 01:16:03,711
Lion on those people to that their own source

1304
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:06,271
If they don't let their own sources

1305
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:07,039
That's

1306
01:16:07,295 --> 01:16:08,575
That on that

1307
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:09,599
That's right

1308
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:10,623
Not Infowars

1309
01:16:11,135 --> 01:16:11,647
Hands Clean

1310
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:13,183
For anything they put on the show

1311
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:14,975
But they didn't themselves right

1312
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:24,959
I don't know how that's going to say I like

1313
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:31,359
I like the little pause after he repeated back to her what she just said to him in a way that she finally understood what you just said

1314
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:32,127
And she went

1315
01:16:33,663 --> 01:16:37,247
Yep that's the company's position they say yes

1316
01:16:37,503 --> 01:16:43,647
That is a probably troubling level of refusal

1317
01:16:43,903 --> 01:16:47,231
To take responsibility for anything

1318
01:16:47,487 --> 01:16:53,631
We can do whatever we want as long as we didn't write it

1319
01:16:53,887 --> 01:17:00,031
Would you say it well if you put it like that it sounds like

1320
01:17:00,287 --> 01:17:04,127
When you take off all my bells and whistles

1321
01:17:04,639 --> 01:17:05,919
So

1322
01:17:06,175 --> 01:17:11,807
To some of the specific claims of like Wolfgang how big's

1323
01:17:12,063 --> 01:17:15,135
Stop that was reportedly reported by Alex Wright

1324
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:19,487
And one of those is that there was no traffic

1325
01:17:19,743 --> 01:17:20,767
To the

1326
01:17:21,023 --> 01:17:22,815
By the website the Sandy Hook

1327
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:24,351
Schools website

1328
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:30,751
And therefore it must have been closed course and the reason that this is

1329
01:17:31,007 --> 01:17:36,127
You know we're jumping to here and I think the reason that this is somatic is that

1330
01:17:36,895 --> 01:17:37,407
This

1331
01:17:37,663 --> 01:17:41,759
Is potentially something that isn't them being a pundit

1332
01:17:42,015 --> 01:17:43,807
Write this is something that

1333
01:17:44,063 --> 01:17:49,183
Conceivably could be presented as investigative journalism is it or is it not well

1334
01:17:51,743 --> 01:17:52,767
First question that we see

1335
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:54,303
Is why does the Sandy Hook

1336
01:17:54,559 --> 01:17:56,351
Elementary School website have zero traffic

1337
01:17:57,119 --> 01:17:58,655
You know where that key

1338
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:03,007
Yes I believe that the top it the source for that pretty

1339
01:18:03,263 --> 01:18:03,775
Tequila content

Wayback machine

1342
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:13,503
First of all

1343
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:15,295
Are you saying Infowars Witten

1344
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:16,319
Figured this out

1345
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:17,343
Went to the Wayback machine

1346
01:18:17,599 --> 01:18:18,623
Came up with this theory on its own

1347
01:18:19,903 --> 01:18:25,791
Oh you mean where is this Source the original source for this belief I'm not sure but I know that

1348
01:18:26,303 --> 01:18:28,095
We have amongst our documents

1349
01:18:28,351 --> 01:18:28,863
The printout

1350
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:29,631
From the Wayback machine

1351
01:18:29,887 --> 01:18:30,911
Damn so at the very least

1352
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:33,471
If it wasn't originated

1353
01:18:33,727 --> 01:18:34,239
Fear

1354
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:36,031
It was checked into

1355
01:18:36,799 --> 01:18:37,823
We have the way back

1356
01:18:38,335 --> 01:18:40,383
Only if he even put that on

1357
01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:44,223
It wasn't in this video it might have been another video she did like a screenshot

1358
01:18:46,015 --> 01:18:46,783
To the Wayback machine

1359
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:48,575
The scam of this way back.

1360
01:18:48,831 --> 01:18:49,343
Where does that come

1361
01:18:49,855 --> 01:18:53,183
Where did he get the idea to go there I don't know

1362
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:53,951
He didn't go there

1363
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:55,487
I'm sorry you didn't go there

1364
01:18:55,743 --> 01:18:57,023
Find that picture I know where that

1365
01:18:58,047 --> 01:19:00,095
Okay so I'm trying to figure out if you know

1366
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:03,679
All I can testify as to the document that I saw

1367
01:19:03,935 --> 01:19:04,447
From the way back now

1368
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:11,615
I did not know that you are book called nobody died at Sandy Hook

1369

1370
01:19:15,455 --> 01:19:16,223
Totally false not

1371
01:19:19,807 --> 01:19:21,087
I didn't go to the way back now

1372
01:19:21,599 --> 01:19:22,111
Myself

1373
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:23,903
Well yeah I mean

1374
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:24,671
You wouldn't know

1375
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:25,695
How would you even go there

1376
01:19:25,951 --> 01:19:26,975
And what would you look up

1377
01:19:27,487 --> 01:19:30,815
I don't know I didn't go to check it out myself all I saw was the document from the way back now

1378
01:19:31,327 --> 01:19:33,375
I saw that there was something from the Wayback machine

1379
01:19:33,631 --> 01:19:34,399
Show me the video

1380
01:19:35,935 --> 01:19:37,471
I need a nothing to follow up figure out where that came

1381
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:40,799
I decide from looking at the document that was

1382
01:19:41,055 --> 01:19:42,335
Produced as the source

1383
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:46,943
About the Wayback machine

1384
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:48,223
Alex Jones and Alex

1385
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:49,759
Concussion is

1386
01:19:50,015 --> 01:19:50,527
Is that

1387
01:19:51,551 --> 01:19:52,063
Thought on the way back

1388
01:19:52,831 --> 01:19:57,183
So this is an instance where there's some sort of

1389
01:19:57,439 --> 01:20:02,559
Gray area like is this something that you're claiming is original report

1390
01:20:02,815 --> 01:20:08,447
Although you already said that you don't do that not doing any journalism

1391
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:13,824
Is that this notes of course not it's from Jim feathers book but she doesn't realize that

1392
01:20:14,592 --> 01:20:15,104
What a mess

1393
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:19,712
No idea about the sourcing of stuff now it's from the Wayback machine

1394
01:20:20,224 --> 01:20:26,368
I like the way that we discuss the Wayback machine in that Clippers as though it were something that like it's it's held somewhere

1395
01:20:26,624 --> 01:20:30,464
It's a robotic Oracle

1396
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:33,536
Well we can sort that we consulted the Wayback machine

1397
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:39,936
And it has given us many Tamagotchis told us the

1398
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:46,336
Give it a gift of acid washed jeans

1399
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:51,968
Machine

1400
01:20:52,224 --> 01:20:58,368
Robot come on

1401
01:20:58,624 --> 01:21:04,768
Play the machine at the same time I get it you win you win Scattergories

1402
01:21:05,024 --> 01:21:11,168
This this was kind of like so it's not actually

1403
01:21:11,424 --> 01:21:15,520
Original reporting maybe there's some other things they were done

1404
01:21:16,032 --> 01:21:16,544
Bye

1405
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:18,336
Someone named the dog

1406
01:21:18,592 --> 01:21:24,736
That might qualify as original reporting this isn't good

1407
01:21:24,992 --> 01:21:25,760
Crime stat

1408
01:21:26,016 --> 01:21:27,552
Which says no murders occurred

1409
01:21:27,808 --> 01:21:28,320
In Newtown

1410
01:21:28,832 --> 01:21:29,600
2012

1411
01:21:29,856 --> 01:21:30,368
Piece of info

1412
01:21:31,392 --> 01:21:31,904
Nobody else

1413
01:21:33,952 --> 01:21:36,000
Yes so that was I did

1414
01:21:36,256 --> 01:21:38,304
Speak to our staff

1415
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:39,328
On this

1416
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:40,352
Particular claim

1417
01:21:40,608 --> 01:21:41,376
I'm so

1418
01:21:41,632 --> 01:21:42,400
This is

1419
01:21:42,656 --> 01:21:46,496
A source that was actually Source from the fbi.gov

1420
01:21:47,008 --> 01:21:47,776
Website

1421
01:21:48,288 --> 01:21:49,824
A screenshot of which was

1422
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:50,592
Put on

1423
01:21:50,848 --> 01:21:51,616
To an attached

1424
01:21:51,872 --> 01:21:54,944
The article it was written by a Don Salazar

1425
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:56,992
Opposing

1426
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:58,272
This article

1427
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:00,832
Just want to make sure you're

1428
01:22:01,088 --> 01:22:07,232
You're right it was in Connecticut and so essentially what happened

1429
01:22:07,488 --> 01:22:08,256
With the article

1430
01:22:08,768 --> 01:22:09,792
And

1431
01:22:10,816 --> 01:22:11,840
It was

1432
01:22:12,096 --> 01:22:13,632
Not reported

1433
01:22:13,888 --> 01:22:14,912
From another

1434
01:22:15,168 --> 01:22:15,680
Source

1435
01:22:16,448 --> 01:22:22,592
Okay it was original reporting on in the context of mr. Salazar

1436
01:22:22,848 --> 01:22:24,896
Because it was not found from another source

1437
01:22:25,152 --> 01:22:27,968
He went to fbi.gov and he saw this and then

1438
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:29,504
Problem with the

1439
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:31,296
Number it does say zero

1440
01:22:33,088 --> 01:22:35,392
But the problem for the article

1441
01:22:35,648 --> 01:22:36,160
Newtown Police Department

1442
01:22:36,672 --> 01:22:41,280
If you haven't finished that what it says is the FBI.

1443
01:22:41,536 --> 01:22:42,048
Stat

1444
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:44,096
Her Town not heard upon

1445
01:22:44,352 --> 01:22:44,864
Apartments

1446
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:47,168
Soper Town Newtown says

1447
01:22:47,424 --> 01:22:48,448
0 but at The View

1448
01:22:48,704 --> 01:22:51,008
You scroll to the very bottom like at the end of the list of

1449
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:53,056
A-Town there's an asterisk

1450
01:22:53,312 --> 01:22:53,824
That says

1451
01:22:54,336 --> 01:22:54,848
State Police

1452
01:22:55,104 --> 01:22:55,872
Do not report

1453
01:22:56,128 --> 01:22:56,896
To the FBI

1454
01:22:57,408 --> 01:22:58,176
So that is

1455
01:22:58,688 --> 01:22:59,200
A source of

1456
01:23:00,224 --> 01:23:00,992
Fusion soda

1457
01:23:01,248 --> 01:23:01,760
Cartier

1458
01:23:02,016 --> 01:23:05,344
For that particular stat but it does say if he

1459
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:06,112
Scroll down to

1460
01:23:06,368 --> 01:23:06,880
Can you tell

1461
01:23:07,136 --> 01:23:08,416
It does say zero

1462
01:23:08,672 --> 01:23:09,184
But

1463
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:13,280
She didn't scroll all the way down the page

1464
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:15,328
And honestly I don't know the answer as to why the state

1465
01:23:15,584 --> 01:23:16,096
Please stop don't

1466
01:23:16,352 --> 01:23:18,912
Support the FBI that's the real problem here

1467
01:23:19,424 --> 01:23:19,936
Purports to be

1468
01:23:20,192 --> 01:23:20,704
Bi there

1469
01:23:22,496 --> 01:23:24,544
Just to make sure that you not put things on the record that are Evan

1470
01:23:28,128 --> 01:23:28,640
There's actually five

1471
01:23:29,152 --> 01:23:29,664
Report that they

1472
01:23:30,176 --> 01:23:30,688
Generated from

1473
01:23:30,944 --> 01:23:31,456
How's the partner

1474
01:23:31,712 --> 01:23:32,480
Every Department

1475
01:23:33,248 --> 01:23:34,528
As for the Connecticut

1476
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:36,832
Please list the 27 children murdered at 10

1477
01:23:37,088 --> 01:23:38,368
You're saying these are the

1478
01:23:39,136 --> 01:23:40,160
I just want to make sure you

1479
01:23:40,672 --> 01:23:46,816
Okay at the bottom of that article is not the article but at the bottom of the fbi.gov all if that's really a

1480
01:23:47,072 --> 01:23:47,840
Then there is the asterisks

1481
01:23:48,864 --> 01:23:49,376
Include State Police

1482
01:23:50,656 --> 01:23:51,168
Right

1483
01:23:51,424 --> 01:23:55,776
So you would he would have had to go and research the reason why that the estate

1484
01:23:56,032 --> 01:23:56,800
Please.

1485
01:23:57,056 --> 01:23:59,104
Did not report for that particular those for

1486
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:00,128
Particular number is

1487
01:24:01,152 --> 01:24:02,688
Or he would need to pull up the document

1488
01:24:02,944 --> 01:24:03,968
Referred to on that chart

1489
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:04,992
Ucra

1490
01:24:05,504 --> 01:24:07,808
Ucra

1491
01:24:08,064 --> 01:24:08,576
Nope

1492
01:24:08,832 --> 01:24:12,160
The top of the dock where it says that these figures on here come from the US

1493
01:24:12,416 --> 01:24:13,952
CCR

1494
01:24:14,976 --> 01:24:17,792
All he did was look at the chart saw the big fat zero and then

1495
01:24:19,328 --> 01:24:22,400
And we talked about how this didn't come from anybody else.

1496
01:24:22,656 --> 01:24:23,936
This was independent research

1497
01:24:24,448 --> 01:24:24,960
Dunbarton

1498
01:24:27,264 --> 01:24:28,800
Write that was a report that

1499
01:24:29,056 --> 01:24:30,080
He did not get

1500
01:24:30,336 --> 01:24:31,360
From someplace else

1501
01:24:31,616 --> 01:24:33,664
Apparently as far as I know it was something that

1502
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:34,944
Somebody had seen

1503
01:24:35,456 --> 01:24:36,480
He might have gotten a tip

1504
01:24:36,992 --> 01:24:39,040
Yeah so Salazar might have gotten a tip

1505
01:24:39,296 --> 01:24:45,184
A boy

1506
01:24:45,696 --> 01:24:51,840
The very basic laziness and sloppiness and desire to reach the decide

1507
01:24:52,096 --> 01:24:52,608
Get out,

1508
01:24:52,864 --> 01:24:59,008
Then I like willingness to just like me I will not take this a step further and figure out what we're reporting

1509
01:24:59,264 --> 01:25:03,104
I will just have the Optics that I need I'm going this is good enough

1510
01:25:03,616 --> 01:25:05,664
It's just it's just lazy shity work

1511
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:12,064
Let let it never be said that the man Jordan's career really ended because he didn't scroll

1512
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:18,464
All the way to the bottom

1513
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:21,792
Seriously

1514
01:25:22,048 --> 01:25:28,192
Breathe read the thing that you're claiming proves a conspiracy how do you not know every

1515
01:25:28,448 --> 01:25:29,472
Everything that happens

1516
01:25:29,984 --> 01:25:36,128
. from that one clip you do like I think I think that she even said it she even said it he looked

1517
01:25:36,384 --> 01:25:42,528
You saw the big fat zero she said every part of their editorial strategy everything

1518
01:25:42,784 --> 01:25:48,928
But they do right there they got what they wanted they quit and that's what the happened at 1 saying that

1519
01:25:49,184 --> 01:25:55,328
Maybe we don't take enough time to recognize sometimes is like trying to role-play or imagine in your head

1520
01:25:55,584 --> 01:26:01,728
Add what you would do if you actually believe the things they pretend they do Salazar and you actually believe that there

1521
01:26:01,984 --> 01:26:08,128
There's a global cabal of satanic weirdos who are you no controlling everything in the trying to kill everybody

1522
01:26:08,384 --> 01:26:09,920
Often they staged the shooting

1523
01:26:10,176 --> 01:26:11,712
In order to get people's guns

1524
01:26:11,968 --> 01:26:16,832
And you found this piece of evidence that is there were no murders they are

1525
01:26:17,856 --> 01:26:19,904
You would dig deeper right

1526
01:26:20,416 --> 01:26:21,184
I think

1527
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:27,584
Actually the opposite is you would want to know every single thing about these

1528
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:28,864
Understand

1529
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:34,496
Because this would be something that you could use help prove your case you're way off

1530
01:26:35,008 --> 01:26:36,800
Cuz I know that make sense to you

1531
01:26:37,056 --> 01:26:43,200
Here's what makes sense if I get into that headspace would make sense to me is I better get a screenshot of this quiz

1532
01:26:43,968 --> 01:26:50,112
Because they're going to take this down and then continue to learn

1533
01:26:50,368 --> 01:26:56,512
You were looking at this and more realistic opportunistic

1534
01:26:56,768 --> 01:27:02,912
These scammy computer sister all about it I'm looking at it from a what if they were sincere

1535
01:27:03,168 --> 01:27:09,312
If it was sincere absolutely is don't try to bring up pieces of a

1536
01:27:09,568 --> 01:27:12,640
Evidence that were misused about Sandy Hook that to mark

1537
01:27:12,896 --> 01:27:18,272
Cuz he knows what they're talking about it is they feel like

1538
01:27:18,784 --> 01:27:24,160
Mark and Bill are coming into this with a very laissez-faire attitude as opposed to

1539
01:27:24,416 --> 01:27:27,232
We've literally spent them how many years doing this

1540
01:27:27,488 --> 01:27:33,632
I memorized these f****** documented this goddamn point I think maybe you're so used to talking to people like Alex or

1541
01:27:33,888 --> 01:27:35,168
I don't know

1542
01:27:35,424 --> 01:27:36,704
This is

1543
01:27:37,216 --> 01:27:43,360
But you just ask everybody doesn't know what they're talking about and it is not the case

1544
01:27:43,616 --> 01:27:46,176
Different animals

1545
01:27:46,432 --> 01:27:52,576
So I don't Salazar I think might be a total creep I'm getting the vibe from things that you learn

1546
01:27:52,832 --> 01:27:54,880
Learn about this guy that

1547
01:27:55,136 --> 01:27:57,184
He might be a like

1548
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:58,720
Number one

1549
01:27:59,744 --> 01:28:00,512
Top-tier

1550
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:07,424
Grade a weirdo inside Infowars

1551
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:13,568
We don't know so much about him generally because he doesn't come on the show

1552
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:18,688
But like a pretty consistently through these depositions and through things here's like

1553
01:28:18,944 --> 01:28:20,992
He was one of the people who was like

1554
01:28:21,248 --> 01:28:26,112
Really interested he seems to be

1555
01:28:26,368 --> 01:28:29,440
Like right there with some of the more f***** up thing

1556
01:28:29,696 --> 01:28:35,840
Connected to some of the more f***** up gas for a while ago I realized

1557
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:43,776
He was really into doing the Sandy Hook stop writing that comes up here

1558
01:28:44,544 --> 01:28:47,872
These are very out-of-character articles

1559
01:28:48,128 --> 01:28:49,664
That we do not go out of character

1560
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:50,688
Flash show

1561
01:28:50,944 --> 01:28:53,504
There were a couple here that add-on did

1562
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:54,528
That

1563
01:28:54,784 --> 01:28:57,600
As I said earlier I don was more into this then

1564
01:28:57,856 --> 01:28:58,624
Most of the other

1565
01:28:58,880 --> 01:28:59,904
People involved

1566
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:02,208
Infowars

1567
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:05,024
And so he did a couple of independent

1568
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:06,048
Pieces.

1569
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:07,328
Really we're out of

1570
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:09,376
Out of the realm of what is

1571
01:29:09,632 --> 01:29:10,144
Usually.

1572
01:29:11,424 --> 01:29:11,936
5

1573
01:29:12,448 --> 01:29:15,264
So like for example he did that Batman article I don't know

1574
01:29:17,056 --> 01:29:19,104
Right so she

1575
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:22,432
Got a tip from somebody on social media and Isleta

1576
01:29:22,688 --> 01:29:25,248
Saw that it was like okay well it was pretty cool and he

1577
01:29:25,504 --> 01:29:26,016
She did this

1578
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:27,552
Dive into

1579
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:32,928
Do you know the three Batman movies and then what that area was called in the comics

1580
01:29:33,184 --> 01:29:34,208
Wrote that article so

1581
01:29:34,464 --> 01:29:36,256
That was independent reporting on his

1582
01:29:36,512 --> 01:29:38,048
It's out it's really not

1583
01:29:38,816 --> 01:29:40,096
The usual

1584
01:29:40,608 --> 01:29:41,888
Peace at the car

1585
01:29:44,448 --> 01:29:44,960
When

1586
01:29:45,472 --> 01:29:45,984
Adan

1587
01:29:47,008 --> 01:29:48,032
Got tipped off

1588
01:29:48,544 --> 01:29:49,568
That the appearance of

1589
01:29:51,104 --> 01:29:51,616
Dark Knight

1590
01:29:52,384 --> 01:29:53,152
Could suggest

1591
01:29:54,176 --> 01:29:54,688
Programming

1592
01:29:55,712 --> 01:29:56,992
Suggest for knowledge

1593
01:29:58,016 --> 01:29:58,528
Attack beans

1594
01:29:59,040 --> 01:29:59,552
By global

1595
01:30:00,576 --> 01:30:01,088
Illuminati

1596
01:30:02,112 --> 01:30:02,624
He thought that was

1597
01:30:04,928 --> 01:30:06,976
Does he think it's cool is that a question

1598
01:30:07,232 --> 01:30:08,000
Did he did

1599
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:12,096
Are you asking me whether he did think that

1600
01:30:12,352 --> 01:30:12,864
Is it cool

1601
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:20,544
Is pretty cool

1602
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:26,944
It was at 2

1603
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:33,344
The kids are saying it's based

1604
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:39,744
Hook nonsense project he did that man story

1605
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:42,816
He did a similar article

1606
01:30:43,072 --> 01:30:44,608
About a slasher Thriller

1607
01:30:45,632 --> 01:30:46,144
Thanks

1608
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:49,984
Sandy Hook to which he just found to be

1609
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:52,544
Interesting just because of the name commonality

1610
01:30:53,056 --> 01:30:56,128
But as far as the other things Source in there I don't know that

1611
01:30:56,384 --> 01:30:57,152
He thought that was

1612
01:30:57,408 --> 01:30:57,920
Crowbar

1613
01:30:58,176 --> 01:30:59,968
The name commonality I think

1614
01:31:00,736 --> 01:31:02,272
Let's take a detour / 2

1615
01:31:02,528 --> 01:31:03,040
To the slasher film

1616
01:31:03,296 --> 01:31:05,088
Sandy Hook lingerie party

1617
01:31:06,624 --> 01:31:08,160
You read documents about that

1618
01:31:08,928 --> 01:31:12,256
Flavor of the article and it's supposed to. About it

1619
01:31:12,512 --> 01:31:13,024
They sent me

1620
01:31:13,536 --> 01:31:14,048
Got it right

1621
01:31:14,304 --> 01:31:17,632
He did tell me he reached out to the producer that video

1622
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:19,936
Does emails supposed to bend

1623
01:31:20,704 --> 01:31:21,984
Yeah I don't know if I read this but

1624
01:31:22,496 --> 01:31:27,360
Mickey Mouse

1625
01:31:27,616 --> 01:31:30,176
Adan saying to that person who ran the horse

1626
01:31:31,968 --> 01:31:32,736
We know this is

1627
01:31:32,992 --> 01:31:33,504
Ridiculous

1628
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:34,272
We're going to run it anyway

1629
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:35,808
Remember him saying that

1630
01:31:37,344 --> 01:31:40,928
I don't dispute I don't remember it all honesty but he couldn't very well say

1631
01:31:42,464 --> 01:31:46,048
And this is just an interesting commonality between the names that's

1632
01:31:47,584 --> 01:31:51,936
Way to wipe that off Mr Salazar Road in email to the guy who ran that blog basic

1633
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:53,472
For now

1634
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:56,288
I don't know I didn't read it

1635
01:31:57,312 --> 01:31:58,080
You don't remember that

1636
01:31:58,336 --> 01:32:02,944
Email back from the guy at the horror blog telling me don't ever contact me again you bunch of weirdos

1637
01:32:03,712 --> 01:32:07,552
No I don't read anymore like that when I spoke to add on add-ons

1638
01:32:07,808 --> 01:32:09,344
Position was that

1639
01:32:09,856 --> 01:32:13,440
He received a response back from the producer

1640
01:32:13,696 --> 01:32:14,208
That

1641
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:16,512
He had received a lot of

1642
01:32:17,792 --> 01:32:20,352
Communication about the name of

1643
01:32:20,608 --> 01:32:21,632
The video

1644
01:32:22,144 --> 01:32:22,656
Following

1645
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:25,472
And that he wanted to be left alone and he thought it

1646
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:33,664
That's it that's a pretty diplomatic way to present to what clearly was

1647
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:40,064
Strains that. Had with with them

1648
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:50,304
He was understandably furious at because I'm a little scared

1649
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:52,096
Also understandable now

1650
01:32:52,608 --> 01:32:57,984
So there was an interview that Alex did a video that

1651
01:32:58,240 --> 01:33:04,128
Conveniently it's very convenient that his boss hasn't seen these emails

1652
01:33:04,384 --> 01:33:10,528
Yeah she also has not seen a video that is particularly troubling

1653
01:33:10,784 --> 01:33:12,064
Does a guest on the show

1654
01:33:12,576 --> 01:33:14,368
Independent Media solidarity member

1655
01:33:14,624 --> 01:33:15,136
Who says

1656
01:33:15,392 --> 01:33:17,952
Lenny your day is coming my friend it is coming

1657
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:21,792
And mr. Jones replies they made a major mistake involving us

1658
01:33:22,304 --> 01:33:22,816
And then the

1659
01:33:23,072 --> 01:33:24,864
Person says go after them Alex

1660
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:25,632
Crush them

1661
01:33:26,144 --> 01:33:27,680
And then Alex says I'm not somebody

1662
01:33:27,936 --> 01:33:28,448
To mess with

1663
01:33:28,704 --> 01:33:29,472
Okay.

1664
01:33:29,728 --> 01:33:30,240
You've never seen

1665
01:33:30,752 --> 01:33:31,264
I have nursing

1666
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:32,032
Alright

1667
01:33:34,336 --> 01:33:36,640
Same token

1668
01:33:36,896 --> 01:33:38,944
We've already talked you very told me there's no editorial disc

1669
01:33:39,456 --> 01:33:39,968
I'm so I don't

1670
01:33:40,224 --> 01:33:40,736
Exactly how

1671
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:42,784
Were there any kind of dis

1672
01:33:43,552 --> 01:33:44,064
In the family

1673
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:45,344
About saying that

1674
01:33:48,672 --> 01:33:49,184
Putting in the family

1675
01:33:50,464 --> 01:33:52,512
I mean inside the I'm sorry let me rephrase my question

1676
01:33:52,768 --> 01:33:54,304
Were there any discussions inside the company

1677
01:33:55,072 --> 01:33:55,840
About saying

1678
01:33:56,096 --> 01:33:56,608
That kind of

1679
01:33:59,936 --> 01:34:02,496
That's so I mean it's bad stuff to say

1680
01:34:02,752 --> 01:34:07,616
Certainly I made you know which one of these things whenever you like here Alex's words

1681
01:34:07,872 --> 01:34:14,016
Repeat it it's like

1682
01:34:20,672 --> 01:34:26,816
Passionate way it's like I can't imagine somebody saying that imagine being on the back of an attack like that

1683
01:34:27,072 --> 01:34:29,376
The times that when you read somebody's words

1684
01:34:29,632 --> 01:34:35,008
It sounds bad no I don't know this is

1685
01:34:36,288 --> 01:34:39,872
Yeah it's one of the things that becomes a little bit of a problem

1686
01:34:40,128 --> 01:34:46,272
Is that there's an internal numbering and labeling system that Infowars uses or they miss pause

1687
01:34:46,528 --> 01:34:47,808
House has 4 videos

1688
01:34:48,064 --> 01:34:49,600
That doesn't quite match

1689
01:34:49,856 --> 01:34:54,208
The one that Mark has had part of this is an issue that has to do with

1690
01:34:54,720 --> 01:35:00,864
Past the lawyers sure given Joya and nobody knows what's what in prayer.

1691
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:01,632
Disorganized

1692
01:35:01,888 --> 01:35:06,240
It would be so much better for them if they just kept all their s*** in a big bucket

1693
01:35:06,496 --> 01:35:12,640
It really would make more sense for them they can just put it all in a big bucket and then they'd at least know where it was

1694
01:35:12,896 --> 01:35:16,224
You know where was Abby very disorganized but that's why you would pay

1695
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:20,576
A multiple people to be bucket Stewart

1696
01:35:20,832 --> 01:35:25,440
The groom of the bucket

1697
01:35:25,952 --> 01:35:30,816
Like be confident that they're talkin about the same

1698
01:35:31,072 --> 01:35:31,840
That one has a video that

1699
01:35:32,352 --> 01:35:32,864
April 16th

1700
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:33,632
20

1701
01:35:34,656 --> 01:35:35,680
Entitled Shadow government

1702
01:35:35,936 --> 01:35:36,448
Strikes again

1703
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:37,472
You see that

1704
01:35:38,496 --> 01:35:39,008
You watch that video

1705
01:35:53,856 --> 01:35:56,416
Okay so again this is another

1706
01:35:56,672 --> 01:35:57,952
Saying where it's

1707
01:35:58,720 --> 01:36:01,024
The video that we have there's a difference

1708
01:36:01,792 --> 01:36:02,560
Dead cells

1709
01:36:03,072 --> 01:36:03,584
The date.

1710
01:36:04,096 --> 01:36:04,608
In this

1711
01:36:05,888 --> 01:36:06,400
Is April 6th

1712
01:36:08,192 --> 01:36:09,216
I have

1713
01:36:12,544 --> 01:36:17,152
I have one dated for 1 2013 that was a

1714
01:36:17,664 --> 01:36:18,688
Interview with doctor

1715
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:19,712
Iconic

1716
01:36:20,992 --> 01:36:21,760
It might

1717
01:36:22,272 --> 01:36:22,784
It might be the

1718
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:23,808
Theme video

1719
01:36:24,064 --> 01:36:25,600
Or it might be a different video

1720
01:36:25,856 --> 01:36:27,136
I really don't

1721
01:36:28,928 --> 01:36:29,952
I don't like I said I don't

1722
01:36:30,208 --> 01:36:34,048
Your internal our internal system is

1723
01:36:34,304 --> 01:36:35,584
Saving them in different ways

1724
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:36,352
Then you're mentioning

1725
01:36:37,632 --> 01:36:39,424
And you're also not full videos

1726
01:36:39,936 --> 01:36:40,960
You know so like you might

1727
01:36:41,472 --> 01:36:43,008
Shadow government strikes again maybe the

1728
01:36:43,264 --> 01:36:44,032
The title of a clip

1729
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:46,848
But it's not the entire Broad

1730
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:49,152
And so the way we receiving it is not

1731
01:36:50,432 --> 01:36:51,200
I get that but I

1732
01:36:51,456 --> 01:36:53,504
We don't know do we know I mean

1733
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:54,784
But if you have

1734
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:56,064
Butthole

1735
01:36:56,576 --> 01:36:57,344
Show

1736
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:58,112
Or it's

1737
01:36:58,624 --> 01:36:59,136
If it's in the Purdue

1738
01:36:59,904 --> 01:37:00,928
And we've produced it

1739
01:37:01,184 --> 01:37:02,208
Doodoo is it

1740
01:37:02,464 --> 01:37:04,000
The same do we know I don't know if it's

1741
01:37:04,256 --> 01:37:06,304
The same because your date is not the same date that I have

1742
01:37:06,816 --> 01:37:07,328
Alright

1743
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:10,144
So let it also might not be the same date because

1744
01:37:11,424 --> 01:37:14,752
Flip being cut from the

1745
01:37:15,008 --> 01:37:15,520
Show

1746
01:37:16,032 --> 01:37:16,544
Maybe

1747
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:18,080
I don't even know that

1748
01:37:19,616 --> 01:37:24,992
Do I know what you're referencing here no no or do you don't even know whether this is a full clip or a full

1749
01:37:25,504 --> 01:37:26,016
You don't know that

1750
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:28,320
I don't know and the reason is

1751
01:37:28,576 --> 01:37:29,600
Because that's not how we met

1752
01:37:30,112 --> 01:37:31,136
Diane H videos

1753
01:37:32,416 --> 01:37:32,928
Talia referee

1754
01:37:33,696 --> 01:37:34,208
Hair is not how

1755
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:36,512
Okay

1756
01:37:37,024 --> 01:37:37,536
I mean so

1757
01:37:37,792 --> 01:37:39,328
At the end of the day we don't know if you

1758
01:37:41,888 --> 01:37:44,960
I don't know I can tell you about the videos I watched at the

1759
01:37:45,472 --> 01:37:47,520
Didn't that was posted around uploaded around this

1760
01:37:47,776 --> 01:37:48,544
Last time.

1761
01:37:49,312 --> 01:37:51,360
Video really need to make sure

1762
01:37:52,896 --> 01:37:53,664
This time I'm trying to

1763
01:37:54,944 --> 01:37:55,712
There were actually talk

1764
01:37:57,760 --> 01:37:58,272
Guess

1765
01:37:58,528 --> 01:37:59,552
About what videomic

1766
01:37:59,808 --> 01:38:00,320
Be this video

1767
01:38:02,112 --> 01:38:05,440
So I don't know if you

1768
01:38:06,976 --> 01:38:07,488
I don't know if it's

1769
01:38:07,744 --> 01:38:08,512
It's the same video that's

1770
01:38:08,768 --> 01:38:09,280
That you're rapping

1771
01:38:11,328 --> 01:38:13,120
Mark I'm feeling like you're getting

1772
01:38:13,376 --> 01:38:19,520
Yes this is our thing to do you deal with

1773
01:38:19,776 --> 01:38:20,800
You're now sitting

1774
01:38:21,056 --> 01:38:27,200
With somebody and you can't even agree that like we're talking about the same thing I don't even know

1775
01:38:27,456 --> 01:38:33,600
What I don't know right now but I don't know it's impossible to like existence

1776
01:38:33,856 --> 01:38:34,880
Legal

1777
01:38:35,136 --> 01:38:36,416
Context goes

1778
01:38:36,672 --> 01:38:42,816
You might be talking about different videos that's right I was talking about that one episode of

1779
01:38:49,472 --> 01:38:55,616
The episode of Alex's show where he locked them in a dumpster I'm sorry I'm thinking of a different show

1780
01:38:55,872 --> 01:39:01,504
Remember that episode of Alex's show whatever Screech got it all that trouble different show

1781
01:39:02,016 --> 01:39:06,624
So I'm in this next clip we we learn some more people that

1782
01:39:07,136 --> 01:39:08,416
ThermoSpas didn't even

1783
01:39:08,672 --> 01:39:09,696
Try to contact

1784
01:39:09,952 --> 01:39:13,024
Okay I asked you earlier if you talk to Jakari Jackson on

1785
01:39:14,048 --> 01:39:14,816
Did you try the

1786
01:39:17,632 --> 01:39:19,424
Darren mcbreen that's another person

1787
01:39:19,936 --> 01:39:20,704
You can talk to her

1788
01:39:21,472 --> 01:39:22,240
Did you try to talk to Darren

1789
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:25,568
Mr. Jones very recently

1790
01:39:25,824 --> 01:39:26,336
And we actually this

1791
01:39:26,592 --> 01:39:27,104
In a court hearing

1792
01:39:27,616 --> 01:39:28,128
Play this talked about

1793
01:39:28,384 --> 01:39:29,152
Archivist

1794
01:39:29,664 --> 01:39:30,432
You know what I'm talking about

1795
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:35,808
If we stayed in seems like we should know

1796
01:39:36,832 --> 01:39:37,600
U-Pull-It in mr. Jones

1797
01:39:38,624 --> 01:39:39,136
Two I believe

1798
01:39:39,392 --> 01:39:39,904
Batman

1799
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:41,440
Instagram says I have an archivist

1800
01:39:41,696 --> 01:39:42,208
OnStaff

1801
01:39:42,464 --> 01:39:43,488
Does incredible work

1802
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:44,768
It should be paid about a hundred

1803
01:39:45,024 --> 01:39:45,792
A hundred thousand dollars a year

1804
01:39:46,816 --> 01:39:47,328
$20,000

1805
01:39:48,608 --> 01:39:49,120
Is a terrible shame

1806
01:39:49,888 --> 01:39:50,400
I don't understand

1807
01:39:52,192 --> 01:39:53,728
He says the guy is like a bloodhound

1808
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:54,752
You can find any

1809
01:39:55,264 --> 01:39:56,032
Do you know who he's talking about

1810
01:39:57,824 --> 01:39:59,104
Target

1811
01:40:06,528 --> 01:40:08,320
I don't have any reason to believe that but

1812
01:40:08,576 --> 01:40:09,600
I mean he may be referring to

1813
01:40:09,856 --> 01:40:10,368
Third party

1814
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:12,160
But I don't I've not

1815
01:40:12,416 --> 01:40:15,232
Been able to find anyone at Infowars at Hazlet

1816
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:22,144
Even even pause think that's silly

1817
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:28,544
We're just everybody started laughing and then it kind of died out at everybody started laughing because it was

1818
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:34,944
Suddenly funny all over again yet or maybe he does

1819
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:41,344
If you think he does have an archivist

1820
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:47,744
Do you think he's going to tell me about that person I didn't even talk to Darren mcbreen

1821
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:54,144
He seems willing to talk to me later

1822
01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:55,936
Sims 2

1823
01:40:56,192 --> 01:41:00,032
Wanted to be associated with Infowars left but

1824
01:41:00,288 --> 01:41:03,360
Dermot Breeze I think Maids right still around there

1825
01:41:10,016 --> 01:41:16,160
1 McMurray it's a family business come up with an like emails and

1826
01:41:16,416 --> 01:41:22,560
Stuff that has to do with the Sandy Hook

1827
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:28,704
What are the lowlights of the Daria deposition was of course her

1828
01:41:29,472 --> 01:41:35,616
Idea that possibly spreading conspiracies about the children not dying

1829
01:41:35,872 --> 01:41:38,432
I hope it's about bringing hope to the children

1830
01:41:38,688 --> 01:41:40,736
Thumbs up

1831
01:41:40,992 --> 01:41:47,136
Are you thinking you really well I got your finger on the pulse of this deposition that Mark is getting a little bit annoyed at this point

1832
01:41:48,160 --> 01:41:49,440
I think that's what the deposition

1833
01:41:51,232 --> 01:41:52,768
What would I ask you if I was you haven't

1834
01:41:53,024 --> 01:41:53,536
Written down there

1835
01:41:54,048 --> 01:41:54,560
And it says

1836
01:41:54,816 --> 01:41:55,840
Alex said these

1837
01:41:56,096 --> 01:41:57,120
These kids didn't die

1838
01:41:57,632 --> 01:41:58,400
Cuz he has a big heart

1839
01:42:01,472 --> 01:42:03,264
That was a company testimony from a scarf over

1840
01:42:04,544 --> 01:42:05,056
Carpo Vista

1841
01:42:05,312 --> 01:42:06,848
Unless the company

1842
01:42:07,616 --> 01:42:09,920
Well he was a representative at the time of the company

1843
01:42:10,176 --> 01:42:11,200
So yes

1844
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:19,136
I think what I said earlier was that

1845
01:42:19,648 --> 01:42:21,440
A vast majority of

1846
01:42:21,696 --> 01:42:22,720
Mr. Jones

1847
01:42:24,256 --> 01:42:25,280
Opinions as

1848
01:42:26,048 --> 01:42:26,560
As

1849
01:42:27,072 --> 01:42:27,584
Broadcast

1850
01:42:28,608 --> 01:42:29,376
Where that

1851
01:42:29,888 --> 01:42:32,960
I don't know if kids died I'm not sure I don't know what else

1852
01:42:33,216 --> 01:42:34,496
To form an opinion but

1853
01:42:35,264 --> 01:42:37,056
This may be a false flag operation

1854
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:39,616
Maybe the government was involved.

1855
01:42:41,408 --> 01:42:47,552
That's not what I don't know what she's were referencing here I think what she's saying and what the

1856
01:42:47,808 --> 01:42:49,600
Context of that is is that if he

1857
01:42:49,856 --> 01:42:51,904
I studied kids and I this is the reason why he

1858
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:54,208
That's what

1859
01:42:54,464 --> 01:42:54,976
I took

1860
01:42:56,768 --> 01:42:57,280
He did say

1861
01:42:58,816 --> 01:42:59,840
I can reference

1862
01:43:00,096 --> 01:43:03,424
I don't know about multiple times but I do know of at least one time that he said

1863
01:43:04,448 --> 01:43:06,240
Cousin died but on the whole

1864
01:43:06,496 --> 01:43:08,032
More times than

1865
01:43:08,288 --> 01:43:08,800
Not

1866
01:43:09,056 --> 01:43:09,568
He said he did

1867
01:43:09,824 --> 01:43:10,336
Didn't know weather

1868
01:43:12,896 --> 01:43:17,248
Wright insurance

1869
01:43:17,504 --> 01:43:19,296
Let me ask you this

1870
01:43:19,808 --> 01:43:20,832
Is the company's position that is

1871
01:43:21,088 --> 01:43:22,112
Non defamatory

1872
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:23,392
Cancel

1873
01:43:23,648 --> 01:43:29,792
The company's position is that that is an opinion

1874
01:43:30,304 --> 01:43:36,448
Position the two negatives equal a positive

1875
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:43,104
Is the company's policy a Mitch Hedberg joke

1876
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:49,504
You talkin about okay listen

1877
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:55,904
Sorry didn't say it said it once but you also said the opposite twice

1878
01:43:56,160 --> 01:44:02,304
Yeah that's a little snippy on marshmallow

1879
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:08,704
Absolutely

1880
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:11,008
From this deposition

1881
01:44:11,264 --> 01:44:17,152
Just think that this is a really good illustration of how little

1882
01:44:17,408 --> 01:44:19,712
Awareness there is of

1883
01:44:19,968 --> 01:44:24,832
Some of the players and some of the things that are important in the Infowars fear

1884
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:26,368
Nogi CNS

1885
01:44:28,160 --> 01:44:29,696
Gcn

1886
01:44:30,976 --> 01:44:33,024
And so can you tell a snowman tree with g

1887
01:44:39,424 --> 01:44:41,728
You know I don't want to miss state it so I'm not

1888
01:44:41,984 --> 01:44:43,264
I'd rather Sono

1889
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:44,544
I don't I'm not

1890
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:45,824
That educated on it

1891
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:48,128
To verbalize it

1892
01:44:48,384 --> 01:44:48,896
That way

1893
01:44:49,408 --> 01:44:51,456
Are you able to verbalize it at all like you have any

1894
01:44:51,712 --> 01:44:52,480
Even rough idea which

1895
01:44:52,736 --> 01:44:54,784
I just don't want to State what it is

1896
01:44:55,296 --> 01:44:55,808
Cuz I'm out of

1897
01:44:56,064 --> 01:44:56,576
Ensure

1898
01:44:58,112 --> 01:44:58,624
Batman like

1899
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:01,696
I want to I want to know what your understanding is he

1900
01:45:01,952 --> 01:45:03,232
Do you understand that

1901
01:45:04,512 --> 01:45:05,792
Like what what are you understand

1902
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:09,632
I just like I said I'm not sure so I rather I don't know

1903
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:10,912
Do you know what house

1904
01:45:11,168 --> 01:45:11,680
To do with

1905
01:45:12,192 --> 01:45:12,960
Which is associated with

1906
01:45:13,216 --> 01:45:14,240
Is associate with videos

1907
01:45:15,264 --> 01:45:16,032
Ice

1908
01:45:16,288 --> 01:45:19,360
Thought it was associated with it but I could be wrong

1909
01:45:19,872 --> 01:45:21,664
But which is why I didn't want to say in the first

1910
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:25,760
It meaning the management of Technology inside of

1911
01:45:28,576 --> 01:45:29,088
Right

1912
01:45:32,928 --> 01:45:33,952
Okay Ted Anderson runs you

1913
01:45:34,208 --> 01:45:35,744
Cngc and is a syndicate

1914
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:37,792
Gcn is where all of Infowars radio

1915
01:45:38,816 --> 01:45:39,584
Maybe not all of it

1916
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:40,608
But a very large

1917
01:45:40,864 --> 01:45:41,632
Substantial component

1918
01:45:42,144 --> 01:45:42,656
Infowars radio

1919
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:44,192
Do you know that

1920
01:45:45,728 --> 01:45:46,240
Genesis

1921
01:45:46,496 --> 01:45:47,008
Antenna

1922
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:49,312
Okay

1923
01:45:49,568 --> 01:45:50,080
Did you know that

1924
01:45:52,384 --> 01:45:56,992
That's deeply troubling noblejas partially because also

1925
01:45:57,248 --> 01:45:58,272
Understanding

1926
01:45:59,296 --> 01:46:01,344
The existence of gcn

1927
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:07,744
Is probably necessary given that one of the subjects that she's supposed to be able to talk about is the

1928
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:09,280
Distribution and reach

1929
01:46:09,536 --> 01:46:12,096
Of Alex's contact

1930
01:46:12,864 --> 01:46:19,008
I mean does anybody was a cursory understanding of Alex's career in the Warriors show

1931
01:46:19,264 --> 01:46:21,312
Cenote

1932
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:23,360
Like it's just

1933
01:46:23,616 --> 01:46:27,712
Yeah I mean it's okay it's just like just tell me what the three letters

1934
01:46:28,224 --> 01:46:34,368
Stand for a f****** dare you tell me what gcn stands for

1935
01:46:35,392 --> 01:46:35,904
Yeah

1936
01:46:36,160 --> 01:46:37,952
I just I

1937
01:46:38,464 --> 01:46:38,976
I don't know

1938
01:46:39,488 --> 01:46:41,024
I mean like it would be like

1939
01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:47,424
Saying that you have an awareness of Alex's content did not knowing what Bohemian Grove into something

1940
01:46:47,680 --> 01:46:51,264
I doubt you do I just don't you know anything

1941
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:53,056
It is amazing

1942
01:46:53,568 --> 01:46:55,872
To me that these things a

1943
01:46:56,896 --> 01:47:03,040
In a position or just all of this continued

1944
01:47:03,296 --> 01:47:06,624
Things that you can only f****** so bad so many times

1945
01:47:07,136 --> 01:47:13,280
But there's just no bottom no whenever people just decide that you don't have to have one like

1946
01:47:13,536 --> 01:47:17,888
If they've got enough money if you got enough time if you got enough everything there's no bottom

1947
01:47:18,144 --> 01:47:21,472
If you're immune to shame amazing

1948
01:47:21,728 --> 01:47:23,008
It's incredible

1949
01:47:23,264 --> 01:47:29,408
Almost all of polite society as you don't have any

1950
01:47:29,664 --> 01:47:35,808
Public opinion exactly you're free now

1951
01:47:36,064 --> 01:47:37,088
10 is about what you'd expect

1952
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:43,744
When there's a source for some piece of information it said to be from Wolfgang halbig and most of the time there's no real

1953
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,048
There's no new information to provide

1954
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:52,704
There's a bunch of clams that passed didn't try to look into a people she didn't try to contact and it gets a bit repetitive

1955
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:57,056
Certain point we can get the flavor of it you know from what we've got over

1956
01:47:57,312 --> 01:48:03,200
And you can definitely feel marks patients gradually disappear even with limited patience

1957
01:48:03,712 --> 01:48:07,808
Mark is a bit of a teddy bear compared to the energy of the bill comes in with the next day

1958
01:48:08,064 --> 01:48:14,208
When Brittney is once again set to sit for a deposition this time in the Marcel Fontaine case

1959
01:48:14,464 --> 01:48:20,608
Uh-oh this is not a subjective judgment on my part bill is abundantly clear about how

1960
01:48:20,864 --> 01:48:24,448
Little patience he has almost immediately

1961
01:48:25,216 --> 01:48:29,056
Surprised when you got a call from mr. Patterson be the corporate representative in this case

1962
01:48:30,336 --> 01:48:34,176
I wouldn't say I was surprised I knew he had been working on the mr. Jones case

1963
01:48:36,736 --> 01:48:39,040
For a couple years so I wouldn't say I was surprised

1964
01:48:40,064 --> 01:48:41,856
When you say working on he's been litigating it

1965
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:45,696
I believe he litigates the Connecticut cases

1966
01:48:47,488 --> 01:48:48,512
So when you said hey

1967
01:48:49,024 --> 01:48:50,304
I need you to go to Texas

1968
01:48:50,816 --> 01:48:51,328
Did I surprise

1969
01:48:52,864 --> 01:48:53,376
Not really

1970
01:48:54,912 --> 01:48:57,472
You ever given a deposition prior to yesterday

1971
01:48:58,240 --> 01:49:00,800
Never served as a corporate representative

1972
01:49:01,056 --> 01:49:04,640
Ever gone to assume you know have you ever gone through a civil jury trial

1973
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:07,712
Have I gone through a jury trial now

1974
01:49:08,736 --> 01:49:09,248
So

1975
01:49:10,272 --> 01:49:11,296
Your background is in criminal law

1976
01:49:11,552 --> 01:49:12,064
Correct

1977
01:49:12,576 --> 01:49:14,368
For the most part yes so what a civil lawyer

1978
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:15,392
Call you

1979
01:49:15,904 --> 01:49:19,232
And says I'd like for you to be the corporate representative

1980
01:49:19,744 --> 01:49:20,768
And these civil matters

1981
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:24,864
Things you've never done before you weren't at all surprised

1982
01:49:25,120 --> 01:49:27,168
Well they're not only a civil lawyer but

1983
01:49:27,424 --> 01:49:28,192
No I wasn't virus

1984
01:49:29,472 --> 01:49:29,984
I couldn't say no

1985
01:49:31,264 --> 01:49:32,800
You said my civil lawyer called you

1986
01:49:33,568 --> 01:49:34,080
He's not Justice

1987
01:49:34,336 --> 01:49:35,872
Civil lawyer

1988
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:41,504
She practices civil and criminal there we go to the answer my question would be yes and I don't need all the EX

1989
01:49:42,016 --> 01:49:42,528
You understand that

1990
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:45,856
Listen through yesterday

1991
01:49:46,112 --> 01:49:48,416
And unfortunately mr. banks in his far more patient

1992
01:49:50,720 --> 01:49:51,744
I'm just

1993
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:52,512
Putting it out there

1994
01:49:52,768 --> 01:49:56,096
About to question answer the one that's on the table you're a lawyer you know what

1995
01:49:56,864 --> 01:49:57,376
Right

1996
01:49:59,424 --> 01:50:00,960
Or do you know

1997
01:50:01,216 --> 01:50:01,728
Yes

1998
01:50:01,984 --> 01:50:06,336
Do you know what to do when someone ask you a question

1999
01:50:06,592 --> 01:50:12,736
Is a bit more of an adversarial

2000
01:50:12,992 --> 01:50:19,136
What is the answer this as simply as you can what is your f****** name

2001
01:50:19,392 --> 01:50:25,536
Say it at me and don't say other s*** what's your name your f****** deal

2002
01:50:25,792 --> 01:50:31,936
I think we have noted

2003
01:50:32,192 --> 01:50:38,336
A difference in style between

2004
01:50:38,592 --> 01:50:44,736
Really as obvious as when you see them depose the same person

2005
01:50:44,992 --> 01:50:51,136
Yeah it's does live up to this it is a bit confrontational

2006
01:50:51,392 --> 01:50:57,536
Chosen to go good cop bad cop instead of the other way around might just be natural

2007
01:50:57,792 --> 01:51:03,936
I also like he pointed out bill was sitting through most of the previous thing

2008
01:51:04,192 --> 01:51:10,336
Got a good sense of what's going on oh yeah so we're going to go through this deposition but there might not be as much relevance

2009
01:51:10,592 --> 01:51:12,384
Material to get through since

2010
01:51:12,640 --> 01:51:18,784
At a certain point you begin to notice that a lot of the corporate representative testimony is really a game of trying to look like

2011
01:51:19,040 --> 01:51:20,064
Effort is being put forth

2012
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:23,392
But there's not a lot of new information that's being provided

2013
01:51:23,648 --> 01:51:29,792
When we were kind of spoiled by having Rob dues confused uselessness and darya's psychopathy and Dupree

2014
01:51:30,048 --> 01:51:30,816
Depositions

2015
01:51:31,072 --> 01:51:33,632
In contrast past just seems like a person

2016
01:51:33,888 --> 01:51:35,424
Doing a job

2017
01:51:35,680 --> 01:51:41,312
Yep she's overhead because that's the job she's your job is to be in over her head

2018
01:51:41,568 --> 01:51:47,200
The reason why I don't feel like there is nearly as much meat to go over in this is that

2019
01:51:47,456 --> 01:51:49,504
With kit Daniels deposition

2020
01:51:49,760 --> 01:51:52,832
They essentially lost that case

2021
01:51:53,088 --> 01:51:59,232
It started crying and apologized for all this

2022
01:51:59,488 --> 01:52:05,632
Infowars Alex Jones of a lot of the

2023
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:09,216
You know trying to tease out details of stuff

2024
01:52:09,728 --> 01:52:15,872
Really stands as a pretty damning document whatever like

2025
01:52:16,128 --> 01:52:21,248
I don't know or do you know that the corporate representative could do is kind of meaning

2026
01:52:22,528 --> 01:52:28,672
Nozbe job that you being asked to do is b******* and that is Alex was taking this seriously

2027
01:52:28,928 --> 01:52:32,000
It all you would not have sent just one person to handle all of this

2028
01:52:32,256 --> 01:52:37,632
But she's also a lawyer and she's being so she can bring the veneer of professionalism to not answering questions

2029
01:52:38,144 --> 01:52:42,752
It's not quite as entertaining as reps of the past

2030
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:45,056
This falls apart

2031
01:52:45,312 --> 01:52:47,616
A couple hours in good

2032
01:52:48,384 --> 01:52:50,944
Holyshit how is it possible I mean

2033
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:54,272
It is it is possible I know in her world

2034
01:52:54,528 --> 01:52:55,808
It does make sense

2035
01:52:56,064 --> 01:52:58,624
If you wouldn't be surprised Norm pattis called me up

2036
01:52:58,880 --> 01:53:05,024
To give her a thing I've never done before end of place I don't know if I would applaud don't understand

2037
01:53:05,280 --> 01:53:11,424
Areas are not an expert in never heard of not surprising at all that's Norm to a tea baby

2038
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:17,824
Yeah he's a chaos lawyer

2039
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:23,456
She's a friend of Norm pattis hey if you ever heard of a no-nonsense lawyer

2040
01:53:23,712 --> 01:53:29,088
Opposite

2041
01:53:29,344 --> 01:53:35,488
So we start off here with Bill trying to check in on whether or not

2042
01:53:35,744 --> 01:53:39,072
Miss Paws feels like she's prepared she doing

2043
01:53:39,840 --> 01:53:42,912
Do you feel sitting here right now that you are adequately prepared to discuss

2044
01:53:43,680 --> 01:53:44,704
Other topics that rented up

2045
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:45,472
Notice

2046
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:49,568
Did you think walking into yesterday that you were prepared

2047
01:53:51,360 --> 01:53:52,128
Damascus Motors

2048
01:53:52,384 --> 01:53:53,152
You could be honest if you were

2049
01:53:53,408 --> 01:53:54,176
Prepare

2050
01:53:55,968 --> 01:53:56,480
Like I said it's

2051
01:53:56,736 --> 01:54:00,320
Much as I could be us I don't think there is anybody else who could have testified any better

2052
01:54:00,576 --> 01:54:01,088
Acidosis

2053
01:54:04,928 --> 01:54:05,696
Did I ask that

2054
01:54:07,232 --> 01:54:08,000
Did I ask you

2055
01:54:08,256 --> 01:54:10,816
If you thought there was anyone else that would be better for

2056
01:54:13,120 --> 01:54:13,888
Why'd you say it

2057
01:54:14,144 --> 01:54:14,912
Because it's true

2058
01:54:16,448 --> 01:54:16,960
But

2059
01:54:17,472 --> 01:54:18,240
I like hot dog

2060
01:54:18,752 --> 01:54:22,848
Is true but I'm not going to blurt it out randomly in a deposition am I

2061
01:54:24,128 --> 01:54:26,432
It wasn't which is why I'm asking you why is that

2062
01:54:27,200 --> 01:54:27,712
And I just

2063
01:54:28,736 --> 01:54:29,248
Cuz it's true

2064
01:54:29,504 --> 01:54:31,040
True

2065
01:54:32,064 --> 01:54:34,624
This is not going well

2066
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:35,392
Nope nope

2067
01:54:35,648 --> 01:54:41,792
What were the teacher's office

2068
01:54:42,048 --> 01:54:47,168
But I think that bill has identified by being in the deposition with Mark

2069
01:54:47,424 --> 01:54:50,752
Pattern of adding extra information in

2070
01:54:51,008 --> 01:54:52,800
2 things that aren't relevant

2071
01:54:53,056 --> 01:54:56,640
I think the goal here is to curb that behavior a little bit

2072
01:54:56,896 --> 01:55:00,480
Try to push back on it to make it very clear from the beginning that like

2073
01:55:00,992 --> 01:55:07,136
I'm not going to Payless and let's nip this in the bud real quick wasting time

2074
01:55:07,392 --> 01:55:12,768
For years we've given a lot of latitude to everybody about you and me just cut the b******* and let's get this done

2075
01:55:13,024 --> 01:55:19,168
Bright and you have clearly chosen to not do them any of the things that you seem to be saying or equivalent I like hot dogs

2076
01:55:19,424 --> 01:55:21,728
And let's move forward

2077
01:55:22,240 --> 01:55:28,384
So get to talkin about whether or not there's guidelines in place for the wedding of information

2078
01:55:28,640 --> 01:55:31,712
And here's what time is Paws has to say

2079
01:55:32,224 --> 01:55:38,112
What did you do to prepare to discuss the company's policies regarding the factual wedding of information

2080
01:55:42,208 --> 01:55:45,024
Try so I've spoken to

2081
01:55:45,280 --> 01:55:50,144
As we touch 52 yesterday have spoken to a number of other people in connection with

2082
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:52,960
The policies and procedures so I spoke to Melinda

2083
01:55:53,472 --> 01:55:55,776
I spoke to Daria

2084
01:55:56,288 --> 01:55:59,616
I spoke to robbed you I spoke to

2085
01:56:00,128 --> 01:56:00,640
Alex

2086
01:56:00,896 --> 01:56:04,224
Jones a bunch of other people in

2087
01:56:04,480 --> 01:56:07,040
Generally speaking as far as the vetting procedures

2088
01:56:07,296 --> 01:56:08,832
For sourcing and articles

2089
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:13,696
The company's position is that it

2090
01:56:14,720 --> 01:56:15,488
Does not

2091
01:56:17,024 --> 01:56:19,328
Engage in journalism so it

2092
01:56:19,584 --> 01:56:23,936
Requires the wedding be done by the sources that exciting

2093
01:56:24,704 --> 01:56:26,496
So this is the setup here

2094
01:56:26,752 --> 01:56:32,896
There is no policy right we don't have any obligation to fact-check things cuz that's them sources jobs

2095
01:56:33,152 --> 01:56:36,480
Cuz we're not journalism despite yesterday having told you that we did Joe

2096
01:56:36,736 --> 01:56:42,880
No because they don't except for one add-on does write all of these weird things that I say

2097
01:56:44,416 --> 01:56:47,488
I guess it's kind of a you know it's a toss-up

2098
01:56:47,744 --> 01:56:49,024
Unfortunately

2099
01:56:49,536 --> 01:56:52,096
She said here that they don't do journalism

2100
01:56:52,608 --> 01:56:55,168
And then we bring in an exhibit

2101
01:56:55,424 --> 01:56:57,728
The front the front page of exhibit 1

2102
01:56:58,496 --> 01:57:00,288
Can you read who that stew

2103
01:57:02,336 --> 01:57:03,616
It says Infowars staff

2104
01:57:04,128 --> 01:57:05,664
Okay in the subject line

2105
01:57:05,920 --> 01:57:06,944
Can you read it for me

2106
01:57:07,712 --> 01:57:11,040
It says new editorial policy for all reporters journalists and writers

2107
01:57:11,808 --> 01:57:12,576
I swear

2108
01:57:12,832 --> 01:57:13,344
So

2109
01:57:13,856 --> 01:57:15,904
After reporters what was that word you said

2110
01:57:16,928 --> 01:57:22,304
It says journalist and you told us that you have seen this prior to today correct

2111
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:23,840
This particular email

2112
01:57:24,608 --> 01:57:25,376
Exhibit one

2113
01:57:25,888 --> 01:57:28,192
Or didn't want us to things so I want to know what part of

2114
01:57:29,472 --> 01:57:31,264
Did you see the first page Buffet

2115
01:57:31,520 --> 01:57:32,032
For today

2116
01:57:32,800 --> 01:57:34,080
Don't you think you probably should have

2117
01:57:35,616 --> 01:57:39,968
Sure specially if you spoke to the person that wrote it who implemented the policies

2118
01:57:40,224 --> 01:57:40,736
Correct

2119
01:57:41,504 --> 01:57:42,784
I did speak to kids

2120
01:57:43,296 --> 01:57:44,832
Daniel Craig

2121
01:57:45,088 --> 01:57:50,464
Mister Daniels he withheld this information about sending this out a specific

2122
01:57:50,720 --> 01:57:52,000
Policy that was implemented

2123
01:57:52,256 --> 01:57:53,792
Post the filing of these lawsuit

2124
01:57:54,816 --> 01:57:55,328
I don't know that he

2125
01:57:56,352 --> 01:57:57,120
Company you didn't know about

2126
01:57:57,632 --> 01:57:58,144
I didn't see the

2127
01:57:59,168 --> 01:58:00,192
You wish you would have

2128
01:58:01,216 --> 01:58:01,728
Sure

2129
01:58:01,984 --> 01:58:02,496
That's Tuff

2130
01:58:03,008 --> 01:58:07,104
You know you never like to run into a brick wall like that

2131
01:58:08,128 --> 01:58:09,920
We're not journalists well

2132
01:58:10,432 --> 01:58:15,040
Here is Kate Daniels the managing editor of the site

2133
01:58:15,296 --> 01:58:21,440
Managerial role supervisory person sending out an email with new policies for reporters

2134
01:58:22,976 --> 01:58:29,120
I think that's kind of

2135
01:58:29,376 --> 01:58:35,520
Gaming material and all of the hilarious material I think the one thing that sticks with me so much is just that much

2136
01:58:35,776 --> 01:58:36,800
When Owen was like

2137
01:58:37,056 --> 01:58:43,200
What tip of the cap to you that just seems so appropriate and so many moments that nobody ever said like she should have been

2138
01:58:43,456 --> 01:58:49,600
You got me

2139
01:58:49,856 --> 01:58:52,160
Do Owens credit the ability to just be like

2140
01:58:52,416 --> 01:58:58,560
Well I think it's because I'm their generation

2141
01:58:58,816 --> 01:59:04,960
You don't have to take nothing but Debbie Owens got that Brody confidence

2142
01:59:05,216 --> 01:59:07,264
Do you lose more do you want

2143
01:59:08,032 --> 01:59:09,824
So other than that

2144
01:59:10,080 --> 01:59:10,848
Email

2145
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:17,504
Other than that policy there are there any other policies in

2146
01:59:19,296 --> 01:59:19,808
Vet

2147
01:59:21,088 --> 01:59:22,112
To vet information

2148
01:59:26,720 --> 01:59:29,024
So from the Inception of Infowars

2149
01:59:29,792 --> 01:59:30,304
2

2150
01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:31,840
February of 2009

2151
01:59:33,376 --> 01:59:34,144
June

2152
01:59:34,400 --> 01:59:35,680
June 2018

2153
01:59:36,448 --> 01:59:37,728
There were no policies

2154
01:59:38,240 --> 01:59:38,752
Whether or not

2155
01:59:39,264 --> 01:59:40,288
Anybody need a devet

2156
01:59:40,544 --> 01:59:41,056
The veracity

2157
01:59:41,824 --> 01:59:42,336
Information that would

2158
01:59:42,592 --> 01:59:43,104
Disseminated

2159
01:59:43,872 --> 01:59:47,968
The veracity know I do believe based on my conversations with

2160
01:59:48,224 --> 01:59:49,504
Keep all that there was

2161
01:59:49,760 --> 01:59:50,272
Is a

2162
01:59:51,296 --> 01:59:52,320
I don't want to say

2163
01:59:52,576 --> 01:59:54,624
Policy but there was an under

2164
01:59:54,880 --> 01:59:58,208
Standing that there would be multiple sources used

2165
02:00:00,512 --> 02:00:02,816
They would have lice only on one source

2166
02:00:03,072 --> 02:00:03,840
But I don't

2167
02:00:04,096 --> 02:00:05,632
I think that that's checking the brass

2168
02:00:06,656 --> 02:00:10,496
So there's not policies in place prior to this

2169
02:00:10,752 --> 02:00:15,872
This leads to a conversation about like okay so you know but like if people

2170
02:00:16,384 --> 02:00:17,664
Do do this

2171
02:00:18,176 --> 02:00:24,320
Can they get fired can anybody get fired veracity we don't know the meaning of the word

2172
02:00:24,576 --> 02:00:29,696
If you do spread all this bad information you get fired right

2173
02:00:29,952 --> 02:00:31,744
Gas

2174
02:00:32,256 --> 02:00:38,400
No one has ever been

2175
02:00:38,656 --> 02:00:44,800
Blue my mind and also made me realize that there were policies

2176
02:00:45,056 --> 02:00:45,824
Before this

2177
02:00:46,080 --> 02:00:48,128
Cuz there's a f****** handbook

2178
02:00:48,384 --> 02:00:49,664
What

2179
02:00:49,920 --> 02:00:53,504
Wanted spoken to mr. Jones and

2180
02:00:53,760 --> 02:00:55,808
Melinda who does HR

2181
02:00:57,344 --> 02:01:03,488
They couldn't name for me specific instances where people had been fired but it is a possibility and it is listed

2182
02:01:03,744 --> 02:01:04,768
In the handbook as

2183
02:01:05,280 --> 02:01:06,560
Up to termination

2184
02:01:07,328 --> 02:01:08,096
So it is a pasta

2185
02:01:08,608 --> 02:01:09,888
What about prior to June 2000

2186
02:01:11,168 --> 02:01:12,192
This handbook was not made in

2187
02:01:13,728 --> 02:01:14,496
When was it made

2188
02:01:15,264 --> 02:01:17,824
It says effective date 10 12 2012

2189
02:01:18,848 --> 02:01:20,384
That was when this was last update

2190
02:01:21,664 --> 02:01:24,480
I got you so what's your position at that employee handbook

2191
02:01:24,992 --> 02:01:25,504
Was update

2192
02:01:28,064 --> 02:01:32,928
No I don't believe that this policy was ever incorporated into the

2193
02:01:33,440 --> 02:01:34,464
Into this employee handbook

2194
02:01:35,232 --> 02:01:36,512
Was that employee handbook made

2195
02:01:37,536 --> 02:01:38,048
Specifically

2196
02:01:39,584 --> 02:01:45,216
I don't know it says Free Speech systems on it when I asked Melinda about the handbook cuz I did a still see it

2197
02:01:45,728 --> 02:01:47,008
She said it was there

2198
02:01:47,264 --> 02:01:49,824
It predated her 10-year there so she doesn't know

2199
02:01:50,336 --> 02:01:51,104
Who created it

2200
02:01:51,616 --> 02:01:53,152
Or when it was off dated

2201
02:01:53,408 --> 02:01:55,456
Or if anybody's Reddit

2202
02:01:55,712 --> 02:01:59,808
Before that you did ask Melinda though when

2203
02:02:00,064 --> 02:02:01,600
And when she said she didn't know

2204
02:02:01,856 --> 02:02:02,880
Surely you wouldn't

2205
02:02:03,392 --> 02:02:03,904
Mr. Jones

2206
02:02:04,416 --> 02:02:07,232
I don't think he didn't

2207
02:02:07,744 --> 02:02:13,120
Accompany the longest

2208
02:02:13,632 --> 02:02:15,680
So he wouldn't know when that was initially implemented

2209
02:02:16,704 --> 02:02:17,472
I don't know if you know

2210
02:02:17,984 --> 02:02:19,008
Right cuz you didn't ask

2211
02:02:19,264 --> 02:02:20,288
I didn't ask her about the

2212
02:02:20,544 --> 02:02:21,568
Melinda

2213
02:02:21,824 --> 02:02:25,152
There was a I can't remember the name of the woman that was there before her

2214
02:02:25,664 --> 02:02:26,432
Bye.

2215
02:02:27,200 --> 02:02:28,224
Okay let's let's break this down

2216
02:02:29,248 --> 02:02:29,760
You asked

2217
02:02:30,016 --> 02:02:32,064
Someone about the handbook and they said

2218
02:02:32,320 --> 02:02:33,088
I don't know that was

2219
02:02:33,344 --> 02:02:33,856
Before I started

2220
02:02:34,112 --> 02:02:34,624
Right

2221
02:02:36,160 --> 02:02:37,696
Regarding when it was produced

2222
02:02:39,232 --> 02:02:40,256
And who produced it

2223
02:02:40,768 --> 02:02:43,072
She didn't know who it was produced initially

2224
02:02:45,120 --> 02:02:46,144
I don't know why it would have

2225
02:02:46,400 --> 02:02:47,424
Why is produce but

2226
02:02:47,680 --> 02:02:48,448
Right so

2227
02:02:48,960 --> 02:02:51,776
Yet this person says I don't know I don't know I don't know

2228
02:02:52,800 --> 02:02:54,336
And that's where you stop your investigation

2229
02:02:56,128 --> 02:02:59,712
Person who probably would have known didn't work there anymore and I didn't know how to reach her

2230
02:03:00,480 --> 02:03:01,760
You used to work probably

2231
02:03:02,272 --> 02:03:03,296
But you don't know

2232
02:03:03,552 --> 02:03:05,600
Cuz he didn't ask anybody that was there

2233
02:03:08,160 --> 02:03:11,488
I couldn't that person but whoever would have been there is no longer there

2234
02:03:11,744 --> 02:03:13,792
You don't think the owner that company knows when he invoked

2235
02:03:14,048 --> 02:03:14,560
Employee handbook

2236
02:03:14,816 --> 02:03:15,328
No I don't

2237
02:03:16,608 --> 02:03:17,120
Why

2238
02:03:17,376 --> 02:03:19,168
Because I don't think he would have had anything to do with

2239
02:03:20,704 --> 02:03:26,848
Probably good I really think that her answer is essentially bill you and I both know

2240
02:03:27,104 --> 02:03:33,248
If I asked Alice this question he's going to say I have no idea you know that I know that let's just skip over the part where I asked

2241
02:03:33,504 --> 02:03:35,808
Kim questions and he pretends to know what he's talking about

2242
02:03:36,064 --> 02:03:42,208
I agree with you in terms of like what the conclusion would be the same

2243
02:03:42,464 --> 02:03:43,488
No idea is correct

2244
02:03:44,256 --> 02:03:50,400
But it's still relevant to point out the chicken in accordance with the rules

2245
02:03:50,656 --> 02:03:51,168
Turn off

2246
02:03:51,424 --> 02:03:57,568
Because where you live in the real world but I mean it stripped your task to do to prepare for the position

2247
02:03:57,824 --> 02:04:02,944
And at the same time there is a part of her a part of me that I understand where she's coming from where it's just like

2248
02:04:03,456 --> 02:04:09,600
Why what's the point really I'll just know anything look deep in my eyes and ask me why I should ask Alex any

2249
02:04:09,856 --> 02:04:15,232
Question and expect an honest response you've asked him more questions than anyone in the world

2250
02:04:15,488 --> 02:04:21,632
Alex may know stuff but he functionally knows nothing cuz he's not going to tell you anything

2251
02:04:21,888 --> 02:04:27,776
Fishing in a dry well on reality

2252
02:04:28,032 --> 02:04:30,848
Probably not going to be very clear about something

2253
02:04:31,616 --> 02:04:34,688
I want to get my hands on a copy of this manual

2254
02:04:34,944 --> 02:04:36,992
I feel like it's

2255
02:04:37,248 --> 02:04:43,392
Probably something that I could get a digital version of that I want a physical copy so I don't know

2256
02:04:43,648 --> 02:04:48,768
Is anybody out there has any ability to get me a copy of the employee handbook

2257
02:04:49,024 --> 02:04:51,072
You know I have mementos and like

2258
02:04:51,328 --> 02:04:57,472
I have a collection of Infowars type stuff that needs to be passed to be at the collection

2259
02:04:57,728 --> 02:05:03,872
Yeah handbook exist yeah I mean it's probably just boilerplate bulshit

2260
02:05:04,128 --> 02:05:10,272
Fun to go back and fantasy book when people should have been fired

2261
02:05:10,528 --> 02:05:16,672
2014

2262
02:05:16,928 --> 02:05:23,072
Hands on one of those I will compensate

2263
02:05:23,328 --> 02:05:24,608
Illegal to buy that from somebody

2264
02:05:24,864 --> 02:05:27,680
I have no idea what we'll see what happens

2265
02:05:29,984 --> 02:05:31,264
Speaking of law issues

2266
02:05:31,520 --> 02:05:34,592
Bill asks at this point if

2267
02:05:35,360 --> 02:05:37,152
There's been any malfeasance

2268
02:05:37,408 --> 02:05:37,920
Any

2269
02:05:38,176 --> 02:05:44,320
Things that she doesn't approve of right she's seeing the part of accountants or low

2270
02:05:44,576 --> 02:05:45,088
Lawyers

2271
02:05:45,600 --> 02:05:48,416
We got on the lawyer front okay

2272
02:05:48,672 --> 02:05:49,696
What about in Eloy

2273
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,816
Do I have concerns about whether lawyers in the

2274
02:05:55,072 --> 02:05:55,840
McKay's have

2275
02:05:57,120 --> 02:05:59,680
Duty to the company

2276
02:05:59,936 --> 02:06:00,960
To anything you came at

2277
02:06:03,776 --> 02:06:07,872
Anything regarding you mean if I answer statements or anything in the entire universe

2278
02:06:08,128 --> 02:06:10,688
Anything that you came across in preparation

2279
02:06:12,480 --> 02:06:14,016
I did have concerns on behalf

2280
02:06:14,784 --> 02:06:15,296
Regarding

2281
02:06:16,064 --> 02:06:16,576
Need prior rep

2282
02:06:17,088 --> 02:06:17,600
Location

2283
02:06:17,856 --> 02:06:18,368
What about it

2284
02:06:19,904 --> 02:06:20,672
Aspire lawyers

2285
02:06:21,184 --> 02:06:21,952
Okay what about him

2286
02:06:22,720 --> 02:06:23,744
I think that there are issues

2287
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:24,512
Is that

2288
02:06:25,280 --> 02:06:26,304
There have been

2289
02:06:27,072 --> 02:06:28,352
Even though the company has Pros

2290
02:06:28,864 --> 02:06:29,376
Material to its

2291
02:06:30,144 --> 02:06:30,912
Chinese has not been

2292
02:06:31,680 --> 02:06:32,192
Produce

2293
02:06:32,704 --> 02:06:33,216
Appropriately

2294
02:06:34,240 --> 02:06:35,264
And has resulted in

2295
02:06:36,032 --> 02:06:37,056
Many if not all of them

2296
02:06:39,104 --> 02:06:40,640
Would that be in the text

2297
02:06:40,896 --> 02:06:42,432
Showcases or the kinetic

2298
02:06:43,200 --> 02:06:49,344
So we've got we got some problems with some pasta attorneys and they are

2299
02:06:49,600 --> 02:06:50,368
AR

2300
02:06:50,624 --> 02:06:56,000
May be responsible for everything that's gone back here I'm just going to say I went back and I looked through all their work

2301
02:06:56,256 --> 02:07:02,400
It's garbage. They were probably lying about everything honestly everything correctly they just didn't

2302
02:07:02,656 --> 02:07:08,800
Produce the documents you guys ask for it's really the lawyers fault honestly it seems unlikely it's all their fault

2303
02:07:09,056 --> 02:07:15,200
Merely that every lawyer that Infowars hired just so happened to be scamming including the lawyer that

2304
02:07:15,456 --> 02:07:21,600
You're friends with who is Bob Barnes huwa

2305
02:07:21,856 --> 02:07:28,000
Was on Alex's show a couple days ago talking about how monkeypox

2306
02:07:28,256 --> 02:07:34,400
Play whatever

2307
02:07:34,656 --> 02:07:38,240
Some indications of cool she's talking about in terms of these lawyers

2308
02:07:38,752 --> 02:07:39,520
Any lawyer since

2309
02:07:39,776 --> 02:07:40,288
Pacific

2310
02:07:44,640 --> 02:07:46,176
I think that

2311
02:07:46,944 --> 02:07:47,712
There are special

2312
02:07:47,968 --> 02:07:48,992
Traffic issues regarding

2313
02:07:49,248 --> 02:07:50,784
Mr. Randazzo by although he doesn't

2314
02:07:51,040 --> 02:07:51,808
Haven't parents

2315
02:07:52,064 --> 02:07:52,576
In the file

2316
02:07:53,088 --> 02:07:53,600
And Brad Reeves

2317
02:07:57,184 --> 02:07:57,696
Perhaps

2318
02:08:03,072 --> 02:08:05,888
There's a button sign and I agree

2319
02:08:07,936 --> 02:08:09,216
Okay so Brad Reeves

2320
02:08:10,496 --> 02:08:11,264
Randazzo's

2321
02:08:13,824 --> 02:08:14,336
Trina

2322
02:08:15,360 --> 02:08:16,384
I'm not sure about mister

2323
02:08:16,640 --> 02:08:17,664
Enoch I think he's

2324
02:08:18,432 --> 02:08:18,944
Donna

2325
02:08:19,968 --> 02:08:20,480
Punjab

2326
02:08:20,992 --> 02:08:21,504
Kewadin

2327
02:08:23,040 --> 02:08:23,552
I'm sorry I don't know why

2328
02:08:23,808 --> 02:08:24,576
What about him

2329
02:08:27,392 --> 02:08:28,160
Michael Burnett

2330
02:08:28,928 --> 02:08:30,208
I don't have a painting about him either

2331
02:08:31,488 --> 02:08:32,256
Ya Baba

2332
02:08:33,280 --> 02:08:33,792
Barnes

2333
02:08:34,048 --> 02:08:40,192
How's the moment of recognition

2334
02:08:40,448 --> 02:08:46,592
Tamara Barnes

2335
02:08:46,848 --> 02:08:52,992
Catalyst not a fan of Bobby bar

2336
02:08:53,248 --> 02:08:56,576
The tone of voice that you said it far

2337
02:08:57,088 --> 02:08:57,856
Yeah

2338
02:08:58,112 --> 02:09:02,464
So David Barnes can't say any specific

2339
02:09:02,720 --> 02:09:08,864
But it does reach the level about

2340
02:09:09,120 --> 02:09:10,400
These passwords

2341
02:09:10,912 --> 02:09:13,472
I went over this a little bit with mr. Shroyer in his step

2342
02:09:13,984 --> 02:09:14,752
Listening honesty the same

2343
02:09:15,008 --> 02:09:15,776
Anything based on.

2344
02:09:16,544 --> 02:09:17,312
Information that you

2345
02:09:19,360 --> 02:09:19,872
The company

2346
02:09:20,896 --> 02:09:23,200
Have the credit company decided one way or another

2347
02:09:23,456 --> 02:09:23,968
On

2348
02:09:25,504 --> 02:09:26,016
Legal malpractice

2349
02:09:28,832 --> 02:09:29,856
We have not decided on

2350
02:09:30,112 --> 02:09:30,880
I made any final

2351
02:09:33,696 --> 02:09:35,488
As to whether to file or who file against

2352
02:09:35,744 --> 02:09:36,256
He's not made any

2353
02:09:36,512 --> 02:09:37,024
Finals

2354
02:09:38,048 --> 02:09:38,816
Okay is it being

2355
02:09:39,072 --> 02:09:40,096
Has been discussed.

2356
02:09:43,168 --> 02:09:44,960
I would ask that should

2357
02:09:45,216 --> 02:09:45,728
That

2358
02:09:45,984 --> 02:09:46,752
Discussion happened

2359
02:09:47,264 --> 02:09:47,776
Metro Ford

2360
02:09:51,104 --> 02:09:51,872
I just be made aware

2361
02:09:55,200 --> 02:10:01,344
Schmitt's interesting you know it's not like a definitive statement that we are suing these people but the cop

2362
02:10:01,600 --> 02:10:03,648
Conversations are happening

2363
02:10:04,160 --> 02:10:06,720
And again it's important that you don't have that decision

2364
02:10:06,976 --> 02:10:10,560
Especially not in the definition with you like

2365
02:10:10,816 --> 02:10:16,960
I just want to remind you you're not going to get to keep any of that money is going to hell

2366
02:10:17,216 --> 02:10:22,080
Maybe we'll change our mind we'll see what happens after you guys have left us alone for a year

2367
02:10:22,336 --> 02:10:23,616
So

2368
02:10:23,872 --> 02:10:25,664
We have this next clip and this is

2369
02:10:25,920 --> 02:10:29,504
Maybe the only adorable moment on this episode

2370
02:10:30,272 --> 02:10:35,648
Because the attorney for Alex's side Miss blot

2371
02:10:41,792 --> 02:10:47,936
Maybe a little bit of an arguing periodically why doesn't she have an attorney in there

2372
02:10:48,192 --> 02:10:54,336
With her cuz I feel like there are plenty of questions she could have just been like I don't need to answer these occasional e

2373
02:10:54,592 --> 02:10:58,688
And also she's made some objections that you're not supposed to make

2374
02:10:58,944 --> 02:11:00,992
In the context of a deposition and then

2375
02:11:01,248 --> 02:11:03,296
Bill has had to say like

2376
02:11:04,064 --> 02:11:10,208
You can objective form in other class guidelines

2377
02:11:10,464 --> 02:11:11,232
Until this point

2378
02:11:11,488 --> 02:11:12,256
When her phone ring

2379
02:11:12,512 --> 02:11:15,584
Was the company at all aware

2380
02:11:16,096 --> 02:11:19,424
Did mr. randazza inform the company at any moment

2381
02:11:28,896 --> 02:11:29,408
How do you need to take

2382
02:11:29,920 --> 02:11:30,432
No idea

2383
02:11:32,736 --> 02:11:33,248
Okay I'm older

2384
02:11:34,528 --> 02:11:35,040
Don't know how

2385
02:11:52,960 --> 02:11:53,472
Sleep button

2386
02:11:53,728 --> 02:11:54,240
No

2387
02:11:56,544 --> 02:11:57,056
My son just

2388
02:12:01,152 --> 02:12:07,296
Interesting questions

2389
02:12:07,552 --> 02:12:09,856
Y'all can all I have that's okay

2390
02:12:10,112 --> 02:12:15,488
I'm sorry sorry I apologize

2391
02:12:22,144 --> 02:12:25,216
I don't know if I can play moments

2392
02:12:25,472 --> 02:12:31,616
I don't know if I can take it I just can't I just can't believe all of

2393
02:12:31,872 --> 02:12:34,944
This is happening at the same thing

2394
02:12:35,200 --> 02:12:41,344
Cell phone if it happen if this happens in one case you like whoa what a great moment to remember that forever

2395
02:12:41,600 --> 02:12:47,744
This is good everyday kind of like a human eye

2396
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:54,144
I don't want to know that I do

2397
02:12:54,400 --> 02:13:00,544
Don't know how to use my phone be the thing that I think is remarkable is that I believe

2398
02:13:00,800 --> 02:13:05,664
I'm not 100% sure on this but I believe that means that Siri has to be on the record

2399
02:13:05,920 --> 02:13:09,248
Ike cited in the transcript correct

2400
02:13:09,760 --> 02:13:15,904
Mission includes a robot

2401
02:13:19,232 --> 02:13:25,376
I meant everybody jumps into helper

2402
02:13:25,632 --> 02:13:27,680
Coronavirus

2403
02:13:27,936 --> 02:13:29,984
It just it just doesn't

2404
02:13:32,032 --> 02:13:37,408
So are we get back to the question-and-answer portion of this and

2405
02:13:37,664 --> 02:13:39,968
Who sings this

2406
02:13:40,224 --> 02:13:43,808
Turned over in Discovery.

2407
02:13:44,064 --> 02:13:46,624
Giants background report obviously one

2408
02:13:46,880 --> 02:13:53,024
Very mysterious buddy would like to know where it came from and nobody does in the case of this Marcel Fontaine

2409
02:13:53,280 --> 02:13:57,376
The case where the whole thing is essentially that get Daniels

2410
02:13:57,632 --> 02:14:01,472
Misidentified the Parkland shooter as MRSA

2411
02:14:01,728 --> 02:14:04,544
And they got the picture off 4chan

2412
02:14:04,800 --> 02:14:05,824
Basically

2413
02:14:06,592 --> 02:14:07,872
Infowars

2414
02:14:08,640 --> 02:14:14,784
Produced a 4chan Post in the course of discovery

2415
02:14:15,040 --> 02:14:16,064
Understand what

2416
02:14:17,088 --> 02:14:18,880
At the bottom right-hand corner you see that it's marked

2417
02:14:19,136 --> 02:14:20,672
Defendants 2000's

2418
02:14:22,976 --> 02:14:23,488
Which would mean that it was

2419
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:24,768
Just by the defendant

2420
02:14:27,072 --> 02:14:27,584
You would

2421
02:14:28,864 --> 02:14:29,632
Why would the defendant

2422
02:14:32,960 --> 02:14:34,496
I don't know how it came to be in our

2423
02:14:34,752 --> 02:14:35,264
Possessions

2424
02:14:36,032 --> 02:14:37,056
Is a false flag you know anything

2425
02:14:37,312 --> 02:14:37,824
About this

2426
02:14:38,080 --> 02:14:38,848
The history of this

2427
02:14:41,408 --> 02:14:42,944
No this isn't wasn't

2428
02:14:43,200 --> 02:14:43,968
Produced by us

2429
02:14:44,224 --> 02:14:45,248
In the sense that

2430
02:14:45,504 --> 02:14:46,016
Kisses

2431
02:14:46,528 --> 02:14:47,552
A post that we made

2432
02:14:48,576 --> 02:14:49,088
So I'm now

2433
02:14:49,600 --> 02:14:50,624
Who made this post

2434
02:14:50,880 --> 02:14:51,392
They were looking at

2435
02:14:51,904 --> 02:14:53,184
That looks like a post

2436
02:14:53,440 --> 02:14:53,952
Spy

2437
02:14:54,976 --> 02:14:57,792
Somebody posting on a

2438
02:14:59,328 --> 02:15:00,096
Chatroom Sodus

2439
02:15:03,680 --> 02:15:04,448
How was it found

2440
02:15:05,216 --> 02:15:05,728
I don't know

2441
02:15:06,496 --> 02:15:07,520
When was it found

2442
02:15:08,800 --> 02:15:10,080
I don't know how it came to be in our

2443
02:15:11,360 --> 02:15:13,920
When you got this document did it confuse you a little bit that

2444
02:15:14,688 --> 02:15:15,200
Estill

2445
02:15:15,456 --> 02:15:15,968
Wyatt

2446
02:15:18,528 --> 02:15:19,040
No

2447
02:15:22,368 --> 02:15:24,416
Is this this dock is this

2448
02:15:25,440 --> 02:15:25,952
Defendants

2449
02:15:26,464 --> 02:15:27,488
006

2450
02:15:29,536 --> 02:15:30,048
Is that

2451
02:15:30,304 --> 02:15:31,840
The post that was used

2452
02:15:32,608 --> 02:15:33,120
Daniels

2453
02:15:33,376 --> 02:15:34,144
Off of Fortune

2454
02:15:34,912 --> 02:15:35,424
I don't know

2455
02:15:36,704 --> 02:15:37,472
Does bacon accept

2456
02:15:37,728 --> 02:15:38,752
To figure out what this

2457
02:15:41,056 --> 02:15:43,104
I didn't talk to mister Daniels about this

2458
02:15:43,872 --> 02:15:44,384
Circular Dokken

2459
02:15:47,456 --> 02:15:48,480
I'm the representative

2460
02:15:48,736 --> 02:15:49,248
This is a post

2461
02:15:51,552 --> 02:15:52,320
It isn't

2462
02:15:53,600 --> 02:15:54,624
And mr. Daniels

2463
02:15:55,392 --> 02:15:55,904
Cold

2464
02:15:56,416 --> 02:15:56,928
The imagery

2465
02:15:57,952 --> 02:15:58,976
Wouldn't that be something you wanted

2466
02:15:59,232 --> 02:15:59,744
Talk about women

2467
02:16:02,816 --> 02:16:05,120
I don't think it's accurate to say he pulled damage

2468
02:16:05,376 --> 02:16:06,912
Only from 4chan I think his

2469
02:16:07,168 --> 02:16:07,680
Response was

2470
02:16:07,936 --> 02:16:11,776
He saw the image on 4chan as well as other social media sources

2471
02:16:13,056 --> 02:16:15,616
So I don't know that this was the post that he saw on us

2472
02:16:15,872 --> 02:16:16,384
Thoroughly

2473
02:16:16,640 --> 02:16:17,664
Where did mr.

2474
02:16:18,432 --> 02:16:19,456
Where did Mister Daniel

2475
02:16:23,296 --> 02:16:24,320
As his

2476
02:16:24,832 --> 02:16:28,160
Representation in the production was and has similar comment to me was

2477
02:16:29,440 --> 02:16:31,232
He saw it on social media first

2478
02:16:32,256 --> 02:16:33,280
I think he said Twitter

2479
02:16:34,816 --> 02:16:35,328
Pain in the wrist

2480
02:16:37,120 --> 02:16:38,912
He also saw it on 4chan

2481
02:16:39,424 --> 02:16:40,192
I don't know

2482
02:16:40,448 --> 02:16:42,752
Whether this was the particular

2483
02:16:43,008 --> 02:16:43,520
Document

2484
02:16:43,776 --> 02:16:45,056
She saw on 4chan

2485
02:16:46,848 --> 02:16:49,408
But when I spoke to him he said he had seen it

2486
02:16:49,920 --> 02:16:51,456
Not first on Fortune

2487
02:16:52,480 --> 02:16:54,016
On a social media site

2488
02:16:55,296 --> 02:16:55,808
Such an ugly

2489
02:16:59,392 --> 02:17:02,464
So we're not really near what I got out of all that is

2490
02:17:02,976 --> 02:17:03,488
Pornography

2491
02:17:03,744 --> 02:17:04,768
Percent sure why this is

2492
02:17:05,024 --> 02:17:06,048
Existen Infowars

2493
02:17:06,304 --> 02:17:07,072
Is files correct

2494
02:17:07,840 --> 02:17:08,352
That's right

2495
02:17:09,888 --> 02:17:11,168
And we didn't really take any steps

2496
02:17:11,424 --> 02:17:11,936
To figure out

2497
02:17:12,704 --> 02:17:13,216
What it is

2498
02:17:13,472 --> 02:17:14,240
Why when

2499
02:17:15,008 --> 02:17:15,776
How it came about

2500
02:17:16,800 --> 02:17:18,080
I didn't ask him about the snow

2501
02:17:18,336 --> 02:17:19,104
You didn't ask anyone

2502
02:17:19,360 --> 02:17:19,872
No

2503
02:17:20,128 --> 02:17:21,920
Weird that is weird

2504
02:17:22,176 --> 02:17:28,320
Yeah I've been considering that you know the whole thing is that this image was going around 4chan at

2505
02:17:28,576 --> 02:17:30,624
Troll thing in the high reported on it

2506
02:17:31,136 --> 02:17:36,512
The fact that in their files somehow that got turned over is this post

2507
02:17:37,024 --> 02:17:38,560
Seems like

2508
02:17:38,816 --> 02:17:44,960
Pretty clear Ada Vista

2509
02:17:45,216 --> 02:17:51,360
Wasn't rolling around 4chan completely Anonymous in

2510
02:17:51,616 --> 02:17:54,432
You know on verifiable nonsense so like

2511
02:17:54,688 --> 02:18:00,320
I don't know what they're trying to defend by saying it was on Twitter not for 10 minutes.

2512
02:18:00,576 --> 02:18:04,928
I mean sure I don't know if that's relevant to the matter at hand

2513
02:18:05,440 --> 02:18:06,976
I mean it is still just like

2514
02:18:07,232 --> 02:18:11,072
In terms of pulling information and it's it's it's Anonymous and its Origins

2515
02:18:11,840 --> 02:18:17,984
I don't know it's very weird there's no difference he just got the image from the internet but I tried

2516
02:18:18,240 --> 02:18:24,384
Actually the difference between 4chan and Twitter is pretty significant there's a conversation

2517
02:18:25,408 --> 02:18:28,992
Real shadiness to the idea that

2518
02:18:29,248 --> 02:18:32,320
This wouldn't be something very important to figure out

2519
02:18:33,600 --> 02:18:39,488
Why that's there or where this came from I think like 44 corporate deposition that seems like

2520
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:46,144
Central almost don't understand how your first move isn't understand what it

2521
02:18:46,400 --> 02:18:46,912
It is

2522
02:18:47,168 --> 02:18:48,704
That they're going to ask me about

2523
02:18:48,960 --> 02:18:55,104
True even if you'd like whether you're acting from a place of good intention or not like

2524
02:18:55,360 --> 02:19:01,504
006 it's not like you're in a knitted evidence 1140

2525
02:19:01,760 --> 02:19:06,880
Before it's number six just go through the top 100 they're probably going to ask about the top 100

2526
02:19:07,392 --> 02:19:13,536
Right I don't know maybe that's a faulty assumption

2527
02:19:13,792 --> 02:19:19,936
Surrounds a post reported on a post on 4chan

2528
02:19:20,192 --> 02:19:22,240
One of the things was turned over in Discovery

2529
02:19:22,496 --> 02:19:25,312
Is metaphorically in spiritually in the top 100

2530
02:19:27,616 --> 02:19:31,200
This is the clip where everything I think

2531
02:19:31,712 --> 02:19:37,856
Really falls apart. And

2532
02:19:38,112 --> 02:19:39,392
Real world begins

2533
02:19:39,648 --> 02:19:40,160
You bet

2534
02:19:40,416 --> 02:19:44,000
So they're talking about.

2535
02:19:44,256 --> 02:19:50,400
Information about Alex is net worth of the company and

2536
02:19:50,656 --> 02:19:55,264
A document comes up a balance sheet

2537
02:19:55,520 --> 02:19:58,592
And it turns out that the plaintiff's

2538
02:19:58,848 --> 02:20:04,992
Don't have this document oh no that leads to

2539
02:20:05,248 --> 02:20:08,064
Oh my God your real problem

2540
02:20:08,320 --> 02:20:09,088
What's the best label

2541
02:20:09,344 --> 02:20:10,368
What's the base number on the

2542
02:20:11,648 --> 02:20:12,928
This doesn't have a base light bulb

2543
02:20:14,464 --> 02:20:16,000
This was produced to me in it just

2544
02:20:16,256 --> 02:20:17,024
This was at my

2545
02:20:19,072 --> 02:20:19,584
When she give it

2546
02:20:22,912 --> 02:20:23,424
Friday

2547
02:20:27,520 --> 02:20:28,288
You go over it with

2548
02:20:28,544 --> 02:20:29,056
Any

2549
02:20:30,848 --> 02:20:31,360
After you got

2550
02:20:39,808 --> 02:20:41,344
I went over it

2551
02:20:41,600 --> 02:20:42,112
Wes

2552
02:20:42,880 --> 02:20:43,648
I don't think I

2553
02:20:43,904 --> 02:20:46,464
Spoke to Melinda about it I might have spoken to Bob about it

2554
02:20:47,232 --> 02:20:47,744
Just ask him to

2555
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:48,512
Explain it to me

2556
02:20:50,304 --> 02:20:51,584
But other than that

2557
02:20:53,120 --> 02:20:59,264
Real quick Bob is not Bob bar on the Financial Consultant then we'll get it

2558
02:21:02,848 --> 02:21:04,128
Bob about on Friday

2559
02:21:05,152 --> 02:21:05,664
Friday

2560
02:21:06,176 --> 02:21:06,688
How long till 2

2561
02:21:09,248 --> 02:21:10,016
An hour or so

2562
02:21:12,064 --> 02:21:12,832
That was on the phone

2563
02:21:13,088 --> 02:21:14,368
No I saw him in purse

2564
02:21:14,880 --> 02:21:15,392
He was at

2565
02:21:15,648 --> 02:21:16,160
He was at the

2566
02:21:17,184 --> 02:21:17,696
Kcur at the off

2567
02:21:18,976 --> 02:21:19,488
Yes I was

2568
02:21:19,744 --> 02:21:20,256
At the office

2569
02:21:20,768 --> 02:21:21,792
Thursday Friday

2570
02:21:22,048 --> 02:21:22,560
And Saturday

2571
02:21:39,968 --> 02:21:41,504
Why did you ask for that document

2572
02:21:42,784 --> 02:21:44,832
Cuz I believe it was relative and

2573
02:21:46,368 --> 02:21:47,136
To the

2574
02:21:47,648 --> 02:21:48,928
Topics that I was

2575
02:21:49,440 --> 02:21:49,952
Testify about today

2576
02:21:52,512 --> 02:21:54,048
Did you where you ended

2577
02:21:54,304 --> 02:21:55,328
Were you under the belief

2578
02:21:55,584 --> 02:21:56,096
Is that document

2579
02:21:59,168 --> 02:22:00,192
I don't know whether this

2580
02:22:00,704 --> 02:22:01,216
And produce

2581
02:22:02,240 --> 02:22:02,752
These are

2582
02:22:03,008 --> 02:22:03,776
The numbers for

2583
02:22:04,288 --> 02:22:04,800
Honey I don't know if

2584
02:22:10,688 --> 02:22:11,456
I know we don't

2585
02:22:11,712 --> 02:22:12,224
Because the number

2586
02:22:13,248 --> 02:22:14,016
As I realized

2587
02:22:15,040 --> 02:22:16,320
That she and I were

2588
02:22:16,576 --> 02:22:17,088
Was giving

2589
02:22:17,856 --> 02:22:19,392
Friday and I plead the revision

2590
02:22:20,160 --> 02:22:20,672
Place

2591
02:22:21,696 --> 02:22:22,208
Can I skip

2592
02:22:22,720 --> 02:22:23,232
Sure

2593
02:22:23,488 --> 02:22:25,792
Why didn't you come with the other 333 I got

2594
02:22:28,608 --> 02:22:29,376
Because

2595
02:22:29,632 --> 02:22:30,400
I was clenching

2596
02:22:30,656 --> 02:22:32,704
Writing on those for the Fontaine and

2597
02:22:32,960 --> 02:22:33,472
And I ran out

2598
02:22:36,032 --> 02:22:37,824
Why wasn't why didn't you hand it to me this

2599
02:22:39,872 --> 02:22:40,896
Ordering the first break

2600
02:22:41,408 --> 02:22:41,920
Second grade

2601
02:22:43,712 --> 02:22:49,856
This is actually in

2602
02:22:50,112 --> 02:22:51,136
I didn't do it

2603
02:22:51,392 --> 02:22:52,160
Cartwright

2604
02:22:52,416 --> 02:22:52,928
That's my

2605
02:22:55,232 --> 02:22:57,280
Do you believe that the information and

2606
02:22:58,048 --> 02:22:58,560
14

2607
02:22:58,816 --> 02:22:59,328
Picard is

2608
02:22:59,840 --> 02:23:00,352
Information point

2609
02:23:01,632 --> 02:23:02,656
Yes I do

2610
02:23:03,680 --> 02:23:04,448
So

2611
02:23:04,960 --> 02:23:07,008
Bill's understandably pretty pissed

2612
02:23:07,264 --> 02:23:11,104
Here because there is relevant information that was not produced to them

2613
02:23:11,360 --> 02:23:13,152
Against the law

2614
02:23:13,408 --> 02:23:19,552
It's certainly against decorum there is an amending of like the

2615
02:23:19,808 --> 02:23:25,952
Balance sheet for 2020 has been done now

2616
02:23:26,208 --> 02:23:30,304
Now is the right time this information

2617
02:23:30,560 --> 02:23:31,328
Is

2618
02:23:32,096 --> 02:23:36,960
Like why didn't you visit yeah that's a really important piece of information

2619
02:23:37,216 --> 02:23:39,008
Why would you why didn't I didn't have time

2620
02:23:39,264 --> 02:23:45,408
What

2621
02:23:45,920 --> 02:23:48,480
Also don't have answers

2622
02:23:48,736 --> 02:23:49,760
So they go to break

2623
02:23:50,016 --> 02:23:51,808
And they come back

2624
02:23:52,320 --> 02:23:58,464
And immediately Miss block needs to amend amend

2625
02:23:58,720 --> 02:23:59,232
I think so

2626
02:23:59,488 --> 02:24:04,096
Mister Ogden I need to clarify my response to a question you posed with

2627
02:24:04,352 --> 02:24:05,376
Respect to the

2628
02:24:06,656 --> 02:24:07,936
Financial document that

2629
02:24:08,704 --> 02:24:09,728
LaSpada's have

2630
02:24:12,800 --> 02:24:14,080
This document

2631
02:24:14,592 --> 02:24:15,616
What's provided

2632
02:24:16,128 --> 02:24:16,896
On Friday

2633
02:24:17,408 --> 02:24:18,688
Immediately past Friday

2634
02:24:19,456 --> 02:24:23,296
And in my continuous review

2635
02:24:23,808 --> 02:24:24,832
The answers

2636
02:24:25,600 --> 02:24:28,928
Are the discovery responses by prior counseling

2637
02:24:29,184 --> 02:24:30,464
Case I did not

2638
02:24:31,744 --> 02:24:32,256
For any

2639
02:24:32,512 --> 02:24:34,048
Profit and loss or balance

2640
02:24:35,072 --> 02:24:36,352
Prison life

2641
02:24:36,608 --> 02:24:37,632
Derogatory

2642
02:24:38,144 --> 02:24:38,656
That used

2643
02:24:38,912 --> 02:24:39,424
The term

2644
02:24:39,680 --> 02:24:40,192
Financial

2645
02:24:40,448 --> 02:24:40,960
Call statement

2646
02:24:41,984 --> 02:24:44,032
And so I reached out and learned

2647
02:24:44,288 --> 02:24:44,800
That knowing

2648
02:24:45,056 --> 02:24:46,080
In fact it has not been

2649
02:24:46,592 --> 02:24:47,360
Play Spy party

2650
02:24:47,616 --> 02:24:48,896
Because they did not

2651
02:24:49,152 --> 02:24:49,664
Considerate

2652
02:24:51,456 --> 02:24:52,224
Odd

2653
02:24:52,480 --> 02:24:52,992
Contrary

2654
02:24:53,504 --> 02:24:54,272
2 mi

2655
02:24:55,808 --> 02:24:57,856
Hasn't that I did get the dog

2656
02:24:58,368 --> 02:24:58,880
So that I can

2657
02:25:04,256 --> 02:25:05,280
I just want to

2658
02:25:05,536 --> 02:25:06,048
Put on the Roku

2659
02:25:06,560 --> 02:25:07,072
For myself

2660
02:25:07,840 --> 02:25:08,608
Imav my client

2661
02:25:08,864 --> 02:25:09,376
The

2662
02:25:10,400 --> 02:25:10,912
I've been sitting

2663
02:25:11,936 --> 02:25:12,448
Corporate represent

2664
02:25:13,472 --> 02:25:13,984
Bagnet

2665

Text her all day

2666
02:25:16,032 --> 02:25:16,544
Without reduce

2667
02:25:17,824 --> 02:25:18,848
Just been sitting there

2668
02:25:20,128 --> 02:25:26,272
This is a good time for Paws to have a fourth wall break where she turns to the camera and she's like oh we're suing our

2669
02:25:26,528 --> 02:25:32,672
Lawyers and then she goes back and we get back into the show

2670
02:25:35,232 --> 02:25:40,864
At this point I'm kind of this blot decides

2671
02:25:41,120 --> 02:25:47,264
I'm going to f****** throw someone under the bus for this because at the end you will hear

2672
02:25:47,520 --> 02:25:52,128
Leave and there's something very

2673
02:25:52,640 --> 02:25:55,456
Kind of sick, there's a quality to it

2674
02:25:55,712 --> 02:25:56,736
I want to make something

2675
02:25:59,552 --> 02:26:00,832
When we started this Depo

2676
02:26:01,600 --> 02:26:03,136
10 topics were very clear that

2677
02:26:07,744 --> 02:26:08,512
That

2678
02:26:09,536 --> 02:26:10,048
Testify

2679
02:26:11,328 --> 02:26:11,840
Was she

2680
02:26:12,352 --> 02:26:12,864
Asked

2681
02:26:13,120 --> 02:26:13,632
For it

2682
02:26:14,144 --> 02:26:15,424
To be prepared to discuss that

2683
02:26:16,448 --> 02:26:16,960
And

2684
02:26:17,472 --> 02:26:19,264
It's been sitting in her back I wouldn't have

2685
02:26:19,520 --> 02:26:20,544
Problem if I'd a gotten at the

2686
02:26:20,800 --> 02:26:21,312
This morning

2687
02:26:21,568 --> 02:26:23,104
Ordering any of our break

2688
02:26:23,872 --> 02:26:28,480
But the fact that at the very end after I don't know 45 hours of questioning

2689
02:26:29,248 --> 02:26:32,320
I asked the witness we get to that topic and then all the sudden it comes out of the

2690
02:26:32,832 --> 02:26:34,368
Out of the bag and now it's saying that

2691
02:26:34,624 --> 02:26:35,136
Ben Bates

2692
02:26:36,416 --> 02:26:37,440
It's on the way in

2693
02:26:37,696 --> 02:26:38,208
You know

2694
02:26:40,768 --> 02:26:42,816
You can obviously probably see

2695
02:26:43,072 --> 02:26:43,584
How it looks

2696
02:26:45,888 --> 02:26:47,680
I'm not accusing you one way or the other but

2697
02:26:47,936 --> 02:26:48,704
I'm just looking at

2698
02:26:49,984 --> 02:26:50,496
Aggregate

2699
02:26:51,520 --> 02:26:52,032
Happened in this case

2700
02:26:52,800 --> 02:26:53,312
All Warriors

2701
02:26:53,824 --> 02:26:54,336
And

2702
02:26:54,592 --> 02:26:55,616
Every lawyer has come

2703
02:26:56,640 --> 02:26:57,152
They're not that

2704
02:26:58,176 --> 02:26:58,688
They are trans

2705
02:26:59,200 --> 02:26:59,712
They're going to

2706
02:27:00,992 --> 02:27:01,760
And every single time

2707
02:27:02,272 --> 02:27:02,784
Replaced

2708
02:27:03,040 --> 02:27:03,552
The new one comes in

2709
02:27:06,880 --> 02:27:08,160
Who did you

2710
02:27:08,672 --> 02:27:09,184
Talk to

2711
02:27:10,208 --> 02:27:12,000
That had a different professional

2712
02:27:12,256 --> 02:27:12,768
Opinion than you

2713
02:27:15,584 --> 02:27:16,608
So that I know who the name

2714
02:27:23,776 --> 02:27:24,288
Bradley

2715
02:27:32,992 --> 02:27:39,136
It's not

2716
02:27:39,392 --> 02:27:45,536
He's just kind of like out of a play

2717
02:27:45,792 --> 02:27:51,936
This I mean he might as well have a f****** bowler on with a little pressed things that

2718
02:27:52,192 --> 02:27:58,336
I got to run to the phone real quick extra extra

2719
02:27:58,592 --> 02:28:03,456
Justifiably in like full of indignation disappointment

2720
02:28:07,296 --> 02:28:11,136
Isn't that withheld this information because of a different idea

2721
02:28:11,392 --> 02:28:14,976
She sells out Brad the former

2722
02:28:15,232 --> 02:28:17,280
And then Mark immediately

2723
02:28:17,536 --> 02:28:23,680
I got to go call the court of course of course this is off the rail amazed

2724
02:28:23,936 --> 02:28:30,080
That is that is so the that is a Few Good Men moment

2725
02:28:30,336 --> 02:28:34,944
That Alex believes will happen and how it really goes

2726
02:28:35,200 --> 02:28:35,968
So is Bradley

2727
02:28:36,224 --> 02:28:42,368
Bradley Puckett dead batch in Bradley Reeves go ahead call the court and I'll give you his number I'll give you weary one

2728
02:28:42,624 --> 02:28:43,136

2729
02:28:43,392 --> 02:28:46,208
I Bradley ordered the code red

2730
02:28:46,720 --> 02:28:47,744
So

2731
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:54,144
After this they get into some discussion of the financial workings of Alex's

2732
02:28:55,680 --> 02:28:56,192
Empire

2733
02:28:56,448 --> 02:28:58,496
Right workings is a word

2734
02:28:58,752 --> 02:29:01,824
Wow some of this information is nuts

2735
02:29:02,080 --> 02:29:05,152
So here's the here's the basic situation

2736
02:29:05,408 --> 02:29:05,920
Bright

2737
02:29:06,176 --> 02:29:07,200
So Alex

2738
02:29:07,456 --> 02:29:10,016
Has free speech systems

2739
02:29:10,272 --> 02:29:12,064

DJ Truss

EBay Alex Emerick Jones perhaps

2777
02:30:52,928 --> 02:30:59,072
Alex has a trust set up most of

2778
02:30:59,328 --> 02:31:01,632
Everything is different

2779
02:31:01,888 --> 02:31:08,032
The company that owns the company write his company owes 50 million dollars

2780
02:31:08,288 --> 02:31:14,432
All right there's nothing we can do we just owe them so much money Franklin

2781
02:31:14,688 --> 02:31:20,832
We're not already bankrupt honestly it's amazing that we have any money to run things.

2782
02:31:21,344 --> 02:31:21,856
I mean

2783
02:31:22,112 --> 02:31:24,928
Maybe it would be more fun as a like

2784
02:31:25,952 --> 02:31:27,744
Shell company game

2785
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:28,768
If it weren't

2786
02:31:29,536 --> 02:31:31,328
So f****** obvious

2787
02:31:31,840 --> 02:31:37,984
Yeah yeah I mean it's somehow not obvious two people listen to a show but

2788
02:31:38,240 --> 02:31:39,776
Yeah it's it's pretty

2789
02:31:40,032 --> 02:31:46,176
Shockingly transparent once you are asked under oath who owns Vista

2790
02:31:46,432 --> 02:31:47,200
Diculous

2791
02:31:47,456 --> 02:31:50,528
He's just a f****** Circle man cuz you asked yourself okay

2792
02:31:51,040 --> 02:31:54,880
What's going on with that trust

2793
02:31:55,648 --> 02:31:56,160
The

2794
02:31:56,416 --> 02:31:57,696
Who is the trustee

2795
02:32:03,840 --> 02:32:04,352
You know

2796
02:32:04,864 --> 02:32:07,424
I'm not sure who the trustee as I know the beneficiaries are

2797
02:32:08,192 --> 02:32:09,216
Who are the beneficiaries

2798
02:32:10,240 --> 02:32:10,752
So

2799
02:32:11,776 --> 02:32:12,288
The

2800
02:32:12,800 --> 02:32:15,104
Beneficiaries are

2801
02:32:15,360 --> 02:32:16,896

And Alex has a remainder man

2807
02:32:28,928 --> 02:32:30,208
And then the

2808
02:32:30,464 --> 02:32:30,976
Income

2809
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:33,280

2812
02:32:46,080 --> 02:32:47,104
What an elaborate

2813
02:32:47,360 --> 02:32:51,200
Way to set this up in order to try and

2814
02:32:51,456 --> 02:32:51,968
Duck

2815
02:32:52,224 --> 02:32:55,552

I've never worked for any business that was like listen we're going to have to go through three different shell companies

2853
02:34:39,744 --> 02:34:40,768
So he sold

2854
02:34:41,024 --> 02:34:41,792
His interest

2855
02:34:42,304 --> 02:34:43,072
In that

2856
02:34:45,632 --> 02:34:48,192
To AJ Holdings and there's a

2857
02:34:48,448 --> 02:34:49,216
25

2858
02:34:49,472 --> 02:34:50,752
.9

2859
02:34:51,264 --> 02:34:51,776
429

2860
02:34:52,032 --> 02:34:53,312
25.9 million-dollar

2861
02:34:53,824 --> 02:34:54,336
Note

2862
02:34:55,104 --> 02:34:55,616
On that

2863
02:34:58,176 --> 02:34:58,688
Where's that

2864
02:35:00,224 --> 02:35:00,992
What do you mean where is it

2865
02:35:01,248 --> 02:35:02,272
Come from

2866
02:35:06,112 --> 02:35:08,160
Fergus 29.9 what's a 30 million-dollar note

2867
02:35:15,072 --> 02:35:15,584
Thought I had

2868
02:35:15,840 --> 02:35:20,960
Seeing the no it's the it represents the value of mr. Jones is interest

2869
02:35:22,240 --> 02:35:22,752
Antique

2870
02:35:23,008 --> 02:35:23,520
CPR

2871
02:35:24,544 --> 02:35:25,312
Such that it

2872
02:35:26,080 --> 02:35:27,360
Such as at work because it's

2873
02:35:27,616 --> 02:35:28,384
About 7

2874
02:35:29,664 --> 02:35:31,456
And then the money.

2875
02:35:31,968 --> 02:35:32,480
Is

2876
02:35:32,736 --> 02:35:34,016
Pay principal and interest

2877
02:35:35,552 --> 02:35:36,320
Off of that note

2878
02:35:37,088 --> 02:35:37,600
Is paid

2879
02:35:37,856 --> 02:35:38,368
To Alex Jones

2880
02:35:39,136 --> 02:35:45,280
To like Alex is a situation like presumably you have to look at it

2881
02:35:45,536 --> 02:35:51,680
50 million dollars in jail

2882
02:35:51,936 --> 02:35:58,080
That's right no I think it feels like this is the this is like a dumb person's idea of how

2883
02:35:58,336 --> 02:36:04,480
How smart people hide money

2884
02:36:04,736 --> 02:36:05,504
He's like I see

2885
02:36:05,760 --> 02:36:11,904
I actually he's Kaiser so saying people before anybody even tries to get to his money because he knew somebody was going

2886
02:36:12,160 --> 02:36:18,304
Call Discovery Bay Egypt

2887
02:36:19,840 --> 02:36:25,984
How am I going to hide this money I know I'll put my initials on it I am not a financial crime

2888
02:36:26,240 --> 02:36:31,104
Certainly don't know if I have enough information from these depositions

2889
02:36:31,360 --> 02:36:33,408
Definitively prove anything

2890
02:36:33,664 --> 02:36:34,688
But I would say

2891
02:36:36,224 --> 02:36:39,040
Bike

2892
02:36:39,296 --> 02:36:40,832
Audit some of the stuff

2893
02:36:41,088 --> 02:36:42,368
I think you might

2894
02:36:42,624 --> 02:36:43,392
I think it would

2895
02:36:43,648 --> 02:36:48,768
It would be too hard to uncover something going on here

2896
02:36:49,280 --> 02:36:52,352
Yep very much self yes

2897
02:36:55,424 --> 02:36:57,216
How many companies do you need

2898
02:36:57,472 --> 02:36:58,496
In a circle jerk

2899
02:36:59,264 --> 02:37:00,544
Before your like

2900
02:37:01,568 --> 02:37:06,688
I think I might be the one who's doing something wrong here

2901
02:37:06,944 --> 02:37:11,040
You know you have a situation where there is this this company that for a long time

2902
02:37:11,296 --> 02:37:16,160
You've been buying your products through and you've never paid them and then

2903
02:37:16,416 --> 02:37:22,560
You get some food in your good hours Shallotte

2904
02:37:22,816 --> 02:37:28,960
50 million dollars there wasn't anything securing the loan and they were

2905
02:37:29,216 --> 02:37:29,728
Like

2906
02:37:29,984 --> 02:37:36,128
You know trying to collect on you or anyting the back when you're getting sued and you're probably going to lose ahold

2907
02:37:36,384 --> 02:37:37,920
Your company might go bankrupt

2908
02:37:40,480 --> 02:37:45,600
Parent companies in so weird

2909
02:37:45,856 --> 02:37:46,368
So weird

2910
02:37:46,624 --> 02:37:47,392
So

2911
02:37:47,904 --> 02:37:52,256
Weird it is like I would expect him

2912
02:37:52,512 --> 02:37:55,072
And it probably would have wound up being smarter

2913
02:37:55,840 --> 02:38:01,984
To have buried millions of dollars in his property

2914
02:38:02,240 --> 02:38:08,384
Golden Silverberry silver in the divorce

2915
02:38:08,640 --> 02:38:14,784
Well I honestly if I'm marking bill I am saying that we also

2916
02:38:15,040 --> 02:38:16,832
I need to dig up his property

2917
02:38:17,344 --> 02:38:19,392
For at least twenty feet down

2918
02:38:19,648 --> 02:38:25,792
Absolutely absolutely I prove that you don't have gold on your property

2919
02:38:26,048 --> 02:38:32,192
Sure clip Bills going to mention that guy Baba Ro and

2920
02:38:32,448 --> 02:38:35,264
Number of the clips that he's been involved in because

2921
02:38:35,520 --> 02:38:40,896
Vols details and questions that are pretty hard to cut clips for into percent

2922
02:38:41,152 --> 02:38:44,480
So here's the bottom line based on Miss paases testimony

2923
02:38:44,736 --> 02:38:50,880
There's this guy named bobrow who was the person who Alex told her to get financial information from

2924
02:38:51,136 --> 02:38:51,904
About the company

2925
02:38:52,416 --> 02:38:58,560
He was working with Alex and Free Speech systems in a consultant type roll Financial Consultant

2926
02:38:58,816 --> 02:39:04,960
Prior to that he had been working for pqp are the company that's basically owned by Alex's family with

2927
02:39:05,216 --> 02:39:11,360
Free Speech system has 50 million dollars or whatever this guy and Alex are the primary source

2928
02:39:11,616 --> 02:39:14,432
Sources of information as it relates to finances for Paws

2929
02:39:14,688 --> 02:39:17,760
In this deposition which Bill touches on here

2930
02:39:18,016 --> 02:39:18,528
And I think

2931
02:39:19,296 --> 02:39:20,320
It's Timmy

2932
02:39:20,576 --> 02:39:21,088
It's weird

2933
02:39:21,856 --> 02:39:23,136
Just for the benefit of the

2934
02:39:23,392 --> 02:39:23,904
Are you with a

2935
02:39:24,160 --> 02:39:24,672

2941
02:39:31,840 --> 02:39:32,352
We're holding,

2942
02:39:33,120 --> 02:39:33,888
It's just a wafer

File lawsuit

2944
02:39:39,264 --> 02:39:40,032
No I don't agree

2945
02:39:40,544 --> 02:39:41,824
Okay why they sent up this way

2946
02:39:42,080 --> 02:39:45,408
I don't know why it was set up this way

2947
02:39:46,432 --> 02:39:47,200
It was set up to

2948
02:39:47,968 --> 02:39:48,736
Protect

2949
02:39:49,248 --> 02:39:49,760

2950
02:39:50,528 --> 02:39:53,344
I don't know why it was set up I don't think it was in relationship

2951
02:39:53,856 --> 02:39:55,136
This lawsuit has a zyto

2952
02:39:55,392 --> 02:39:56,160

Work for one company

Please down

2968
02:40:24,832 --> 02:40:28,928
You trusted him and you trusted mr. Jones the sole proprietor of a company

2969
02:40:29,952 --> 02:40:31,488
Is the subject of

2970
02:40:31,744 --> 02:40:33,536
A number of defamation lawsuit

2971
02:40:34,048 --> 02:40:37,120
Involving parents who lost children in a school shooting

2972
02:40:37,632 --> 02:40:38,400
44 years

2973
02:40:39,168 --> 02:40:40,448
Then went on to say that

2974
02:40:40,704 --> 02:40:42,240
It didn't happen or it did but

2975
02:40:43,264 --> 02:40:44,032
There was a government

2976
02:40:44,288 --> 02:40:46,080
Spira seeing all of this other

2977
02:40:46,848 --> 02:40:48,640
That those are the two people you trust it

2978
02:40:48,896 --> 02:40:49,408
Correct

2979
02:40:49,920 --> 02:40:51,968
Those are the people with the information so yes

2980
02:40:52,224 --> 02:40:53,248
You think it's odd that they

2981
02:40:53,504 --> 02:40:55,040
Somebody for this topic.

2982
02:40:55,552 --> 02:40:56,064
0 funny

2983
02:40:57,088 --> 02:40:58,112
I can't answer that I don't know

2984
02:40:58,368 --> 02:41:04,512
I wouldn't answer that either

2985
02:41:04,768 --> 02:41:08,608
Does look a little bit suspicious would surprise her

2986
02:41:09,120 --> 02:41:15,264
Not much just flappable

2987
02:41:15,520 --> 02:41:18,592
Norm just said show up in Texas and you're like f*** yeah 30 grants great

2988
02:41:18,848 --> 02:41:23,968
Would it surprise you to learn that the person that you are here as a corporate representative for believes

2989
02:41:24,224 --> 02:41:28,832
But his enemies are demons that sounds about right

2990
02:41:29,088 --> 02:41:32,416
So the question comes up and I think this is a pretty

2991
02:41:32,672 --> 02:41:36,000
Relevant question that's a bills gotten that is basically

2992
02:41:36,256 --> 02:41:38,560
Okay so if we look at these pallets sheets here

2993
02:41:39,328 --> 02:41:39,840
How the

2994
02:41:40,096 --> 02:41:40,608
Buck does

2995
02:41:40,864 --> 02:41:42,656
Good any bills get paid

2996
02:41:42,912 --> 02:41:45,984
What's going on

2997
02:41:47,776 --> 02:41:51,104
Based on this balance sheet how is mr. Jones covering his bills every month

2998
02:41:52,384 --> 02:41:55,200
How is Free Speech systems covering their bills every

2999
02:42:01,088 --> 02:42:05,184
So there are so there's income that

3000
02:42:05,440 --> 02:42:06,208
BF

3001
02:42:06,720 --> 02:42:08,768
That Free Speech makes off of the

3002
02:42:09,280 --> 02:42:10,304
Relationship with

3003
02:42:10,816 --> 02:42:12,352
Uprb of the sales

3004
02:42:13,120 --> 02:42:15,168
Pqp are also pays

3005
02:42:16,192 --> 02:42:17,728
Money to free speech

3006
02:42:17,984 --> 02:42:19,520
For advertising

3007
02:42:19,776 --> 02:42:20,800
On the website

3008
02:42:21,056 --> 02:42:22,592
That includes the banners and such

3009
02:42:23,104 --> 02:42:24,128
So that's

3010
02:42:26,944 --> 02:42:31,552
And so essentially the way that the business makes money is

3011
02:42:31,808 --> 02:42:33,856
Is those two primary ways

3012
02:42:34,112 --> 02:42:34,624
Okay

3013
02:42:34,880 --> 02:42:37,184
Let's look at the balance sheet

3014
02:42:37,952 --> 02:42:38,464
Provided

3015
02:42:40,768 --> 02:42:41,280
Okay

3016
02:42:43,072 --> 02:42:44,096
The balance sheet

3017
02:42:44,864 --> 02:42:45,888
Is for all the 20

3018
02:42:46,656 --> 02:42:47,424
Crack Enter Sandman

3019
02:42:48,448 --> 02:42:48,960
That's what it says

3020
02:42:49,216 --> 02:42:49,728
Okay

3021
02:42:50,240 --> 02:42:50,752
And

3022
02:42:51,264 --> 02:42:52,800
Can you tell me where

3023
02:42:53,056 --> 02:42:54,080
The income is

3024
02:42:55,104 --> 02:42:57,152
The Infowars makes from pqp are forever

3025
02:43:17,120 --> 02:43:18,656
I don't know if this is

3026
02:43:18,912 --> 02:43:21,984
Not a specific line item I know that

3027
02:43:22,496 --> 02:43:23,264
There are

3028
02:43:24,800 --> 02:43:26,592
There are line items

3029
02:43:26,848 --> 02:43:32,992
That was not a real answer help I think she goes on to speculate that maybe one of the redacted columns

3030
02:43:33,248 --> 02:43:35,552
1 rodak Circle

3031
02:43:35,808 --> 02:43:41,184
The organization exists in such a way that

3032
02:43:41,952 --> 02:43:43,488
Alex makes money

3033
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:50,144
By taking a cut of the things that are sold through his business by pqp are

3034
02:43:50,400 --> 02:43:53,728
Nmp couper advertising on his show

3035
02:43:53,984 --> 02:43:56,288
Or on his website buying the banner ads

3036
02:43:59,616 --> 02:44:02,176
Advertising money for himself and his parents

3037
02:44:02,432 --> 02:44:04,480
Circular

3038
02:44:04,992 --> 02:44:06,272
It's some

3039
02:44:07,040 --> 02:44:13,184
Well I mean it's only it's just designed specifically to do the one

3040
02:44:13,440 --> 02:44:16,000
One thing that it's doing poorly right now

3041
02:44:16,256 --> 02:44:19,328
You know yes that's what it's doing

3042
02:44:19,584 --> 02:44:25,728
And it's doing such a bad job of it that when she went to ask for more information to clarify

3043
02:44:25,984 --> 02:44:26,496
Five things

3044
02:44:27,008 --> 02:44:30,080
It only made it more obvious how

3045
02:44:30,336 --> 02:44:36,480
What they were trying to do is fairly easy to

3046
02:44:36,736 --> 02:44:42,880
Hide a little bit better I would hope so

3047
02:44:43,136 --> 02:44:49,280
I trust this is all rich people hide their money via shittily then it's clear

3048
02:44:49,536 --> 02:44:52,608
Merely that they just can't afford to own the entire legal system

3049
02:44:52,864 --> 02:44:59,008
Because I feel like it this is how it works I can spend a weekend and every Beezus would be bankrupt to

3050
02:44:59,264 --> 02:45:02,080
Tomorrow

3051
02:45:02,336 --> 02:45:07,968
Quite honestly I think that setting things up like this there's nothing illegal about it it's just

3052
02:45:08,224 --> 02:45:14,368
So it's just recognizing that like oh you have this bizarre maze

3053
02:45:14,624 --> 02:45:18,976
Of entities that you and your parents own right that are meant to

3054
02:45:19,232 --> 02:45:23,072
Make transactions more complicated than they need to be

3055
02:45:23,328 --> 02:45:29,472
That isn't bad to prove some kind of malfeasance on top of it

3056
02:45:29,728 --> 02:45:31,264
I think that that is

3057
02:45:31,520 --> 02:45:34,592
Where the confidence comes from right and

3058
02:45:34,848 --> 02:45:37,152
I don't know is any specific

3059
02:45:37,408 --> 02:45:43,040
Malfeasance has been demonstrated but I don't know I don't know if it'd be too difficult given the

3060
02:45:43,808 --> 02:45:49,952
You know the obvious or the nature of the interconnectedness of these entities

3061
02:45:50,208 --> 02:45:56,352
It's not surprising that she was asked if they'll she had no prior Financial experience

3062
02:45:56,608 --> 02:46:01,984
Evidence of a crime but if there is I don't think it'd be hard to figure out boy so

3063
02:46:02,496 --> 02:46:08,639
We'll keep our eyes on that is holding the murder weapon and who had a motive and who did the crime so will

3064
02:46:08,895 --> 02:46:10,687
We'll see if we can figure it out sure

3065
02:46:11,455 --> 02:46:15,295
Do this another document comes up that hasn't been

3066
02:46:15,551 --> 02:46:21,439
I've given to the plaintiff's this is a mess

3067
02:46:21,951 --> 02:46:22,975
Schedule C

3068
02:46:23,487 --> 02:46:24,255
Put your review

3069
02:46:24,511 --> 02:46:25,023
Nautica

3070
02:46:25,279 --> 02:46:25,791
Complete tax

3071
02:46:26,815 --> 02:46:30,911
That's what the document is Schedule C of the Galaxy's taxes

3072
02:46:31,423 --> 02:46:32,959
Is not a finalize

3073
02:46:33,215 --> 02:46:33,983
Schedule C

3074
02:46:34,239 --> 02:46:36,543
Has not been filed with the internal revenue

3075
02:46:37,055 --> 02:46:40,895
But the witness relied on it for her testimony right now

3076
02:46:42,687 --> 02:46:43,967
I don't understand where the

3077
02:46:44,479 --> 02:46:45,759
Miscommunication is on my end

3078
02:46:46,015 --> 02:46:47,551
I don't know why

3079
02:46:47,807 --> 02:46:50,879
She's testifying that she realized she has the same numbers

3080
02:46:53,439 --> 02:46:53,951
How do you know

3081
02:46:54,207 --> 02:46:55,231
Have you seen it

3082
02:46:57,023 --> 02:46:58,303
Okay why isn't it

3083
02:47:03,679 --> 02:47:04,191
Why are we not priests

3084
02:47:04,447 --> 02:47:04,959
Right now

3085
02:47:06,751 --> 02:47:08,287
Do you want to continue with the doctors are

3086
02:47:11,359 --> 02:47:12,383
I'm literally giving you

3087
02:47:14,431 --> 02:47:14,943
A life

3088

To try just fix it if you haven't handed over if not

3089
02:47:18,527 --> 02:47:19,807
We can cure it now

3090
02:47:20,575 --> 02:47:22,111
But if that's if your response is

3091
02:47:22,367 --> 02:47:23,391
File your motion or

3092
02:47:23,647 --> 02:47:26,975

It's an explanation

02:47:30,303 --> 02:47:31,071
It's not Anna

3096
02:47:31,327 --> 02:47:31,839
Excuse

Since the day I got on this case

Documents

3105
02:47:45,919 --> 02:47:46,431
You have been

3106
02:47:46,687 --> 02:47:47,455
Provided with

3107
02:47:47,967 --> 02:47:48,735
AR

3108
02:47:50,527 --> 02:47:51,551
Pulling complete.

3109
02:47:53,855 --> 02:47:55,135
As an example

3110
02:47:55,647 --> 02:47:58,975
I realized when I saw the profit-and-loss in the balance sheet

3111
02:47:59,487 --> 02:48:02,047
Did it had not been produced because of

3112
02:48:03,583 --> 02:48:06,143
Differences in opinions on

3113
02:48:06,911 --> 02:48:08,191
The definition of Finance

3114
02:48:08,447 --> 02:48:08,959
Statement

3115
02:48:12,287 --> 02:48:18,431
I said OG surprise surprise

3116
02:48:25,855 --> 02:48:26,623
Because I guess

3117
02:48:27,135 --> 02:48:27,647
Invocation is

3118
02:48:28,159 --> 02:48:28,671
Brad Reeves

3119
02:48:28,927 --> 02:48:30,207
Is a liar or has a

3120
02:48:33,279 --> 02:48:39,423
Cool boy cowboy Marcos golf Brad and checked on this

3121
02:48:39,679 --> 02:48:45,823
Love that that is that is the perfect time that is the perfect. He's known it he's had that

3122
02:48:46,079 --> 02:48:52,223
Pocket for a while now waiting for just the right moment for him to just

3123
02:48:52,479 --> 02:48:58,623
Brad Bradbury says you're full of s*** by the way I think it's probably because it would not have come up

3124
02:48:58,879 --> 02:49:01,183
Of the deposition itself

3125
02:49:01,439 --> 02:49:04,511
She broached that subject again exactly what she did

3126
02:49:04,767 --> 02:49:05,791
And now it's great

3127
02:49:06,559 --> 02:49:10,143
This is a mess that is a total mess straight up

3128
02:49:10,399 --> 02:49:15,775
F****** Matlock ass down home country lawyer s*** is not an excuse

3129
02:49:16,031 --> 02:49:17,055
Is an explanation

3130
02:49:17,311 --> 02:49:21,663
Bright I take responsibility for what I do

3131
02:49:22,175 --> 02:49:22,687
Now

3132
02:49:22,943 --> 02:49:24,223
But it's everybody else's fault

3133
02:49:24,735 --> 02:49:28,063
Yeah so they need to

3134
02:49:28,319 --> 02:49:29,087
Shelves

3135
02:49:30,111 --> 02:49:31,647
Discussion to financial stuff

3136
02:49:32,159 --> 02:49:38,303
Because they are there is no situation where should this is not going

3137
02:49:38,559 --> 02:49:44,703
We're going into a very non productive territory drama that

3138
02:49:44,959 --> 02:49:50,591
It happens because Miss pause brings out her notepad and

3139
02:49:50,847 --> 02:49:53,663
Under Texas rules Texas law

3140
02:49:53,919 --> 02:50:00,063
If you're using a notepad to consult with when you're at a deposition it becomes evident yes

3141
02:50:00,319 --> 02:50:01,599
She brought up

3142
02:50:01,855 --> 02:50:04,415
A notepad that maybe she didn't want as evidence

3143
02:50:04,671 --> 02:50:10,815
And maybe some of it included notes on privileged information with her lawyer and attorney

3144
02:50:11,071 --> 02:50:12,095
Texas

3145
02:50:12,351 --> 02:50:18,495
Does Not Your Privilege is not protected if it's something that is a notepad that is

3146
02:50:18,751 --> 02:50:20,799
I used to consult during a deposition

3147
02:50:21,055 --> 02:50:27,199
And so they have a big argument about this and weather

3148
02:50:27,455 --> 02:50:33,599
Just asked you to work in a state that you've never worked in before does that surprise you finally

3149
02:50:33,855 --> 02:50:35,903
Yeah it sucks

3150
02:50:36,159 --> 02:50:42,303
Is for sure

3151
02:50:42,559 --> 02:50:48,703
I believe that spiritually

3152
02:50:48,959 --> 02:50:50,751
Pink or just kind of like

3153
02:50:51,519 --> 02:50:54,079
A good Cota little rap-up

3154
02:50:54,335 --> 02:50:57,407
First one is just a demonstration of how

3155
02:50:57,663 --> 02:50:59,455
Narcissistic Alex's or

3156
02:50:59,711 --> 02:51:03,039
This was a conversation I had with mr. Jones about

3157
02:51:03,295 --> 02:51:05,087
Using 4chan

3158
02:51:05,599 --> 02:51:06,111
4

3159
02:51:06,623 --> 02:51:07,391
Material

3160
02:51:07,647 --> 02:51:08,927
From which to draw

3161
02:51:09,439 --> 02:51:11,743
And Mr Jones's

3162
02:51:12,511 --> 02:51:13,279
Keep he

3163
02:51:14,047 --> 02:51:14,815
He is Rasika

3164
02:51:15,071 --> 02:51:17,375
The after that I talked a lot about pizzagate

3165
02:51:17,887 --> 02:51:21,215
An operative on 4chan and it's mister

3166
02:51:21,471 --> 02:51:21,983
Jones is a

3167
02:51:22,239 --> 02:51:22,751
Opinion

3168
02:51:23,007 --> 02:51:23,519
Is that

3169
02:51:24,799 --> 02:51:25,823
4chan

3170
02:51:26,335 --> 02:51:26,847
Is

3171
02:51:27,615 --> 02:51:29,919
That people purposely sometimes

3172
02:51:30,175 --> 02:51:30,687
Post

3173
02:51:30,943 --> 02:51:32,223
Information on there

3174
02:51:32,991 --> 02:51:33,503
For the

3175
02:51:33,759 --> 02:51:35,295
Purpose of misleading

3176
02:51:36,319 --> 02:51:39,903
And he used pizzagate as an example but

3177
02:51:40,159 --> 02:51:40,671
His

3178
02:51:41,183 --> 02:51:43,743
Position was he what didn't realize that

3179
02:51:45,791 --> 02:51:48,351
But after pizzagate mr. Jones realize for Chandler

3180
02:51:50,143 --> 02:51:50,911
It's not reliable

3181
02:51:51,935 --> 02:51:56,031
Well not that it wasn't reliable but that I think he thinks that people are

3182
02:51:57,567 --> 02:51:59,103
People associated with

3183
02:51:59,359 --> 02:52:02,175
Certain entities are posting things on there to try to

3184
02:52:02,687 --> 02:52:05,503
Like a breadcrumb to get him to pick up on base

3185
02:52:05,759 --> 02:52:07,295
So I think that that was the

3186
02:52:08,063 --> 02:52:08,831
Sum and substance

3187
02:52:09,087 --> 02:52:09,855
Cancel that part of our car

3188
02:52:10,367 --> 02:52:11,391
What entities

3189
02:52:13,439 --> 02:52:16,767
The Democratic Party

3190
02:52:19,583 --> 02:52:20,095
Any other

3191
02:52:20,351 --> 02:52:21,119
People that he

3192
02:52:22,143 --> 02:52:22,655
Things Are

3193
02:52:23,423 --> 02:52:24,447
Trying to spread method

3194
02:52:24,959 --> 02:52:25,471
Animation

3195
02:52:25,727 --> 02:52:31,871
Okay yeah so Alex believes that the global is there trying to trick him with posts on 4chan in order to get him

3196
02:52:32,127 --> 02:52:33,151
Time to cover stuff

3197
02:52:34,175 --> 02:52:38,527
Yep ohmygod allowed in a deposition

3198
02:52:38,783 --> 02:52:40,063
For the world to here

3199
02:52:40,831 --> 02:52:41,343
I mean

3200
02:52:41,855 --> 02:52:44,159
Amazing interesting

3201
02:52:44,415 --> 02:52:47,999
Thing to imagine that he thinks it's because it's

3202
02:52:48,511 --> 02:52:50,559
It's outrageously

3203
02:52:51,071 --> 02:52:57,215
Detached from reality it is the state of position of free speech

3204
02:52:57,471 --> 02:53:03,615
Future systems that everyone is out to get us the government everyone every

3205
02:53:03,871 --> 02:53:10,015
As a company stated position that Alex Jones believes

3206
02:53:10,271 --> 02:53:16,159
The globalists are trying to plant stories item

3207
02:53:16,415 --> 02:53:18,719
Apologies

3208
02:53:18,975 --> 02:53:23,583
So we've been we've been through a lot here we've heard a fair amount of

3209
02:53:24,607 --> 02:53:29,983
Bad stuff review

02:53:41,759 --> 02:53:42,271
With

3213
02:53:42,783 --> 02:53:44,575
With how this Depp has gone

3214
02:53:46,879 --> 02:53:47,391
How do you think

3215
02:53:49,439 --> 02:53:50,207
Pictures of pretty good

3216
02:53:53,279 --> 02:53:54,815
Wow

3217
02:53:55,327 --> 02:54:01,471
Wow so they filed a motion obviously

3218
02:54:01,727 --> 02:54:07,871
And on April 1st the order came down from the court and in addition to the other pass

3219
02:54:09,663 --> 02:54:15,807
Corporate representative testimonies that were just a disaster here is what the court said about this

3220
02:54:16,063 --> 02:54:17,343
One in particular

3221
02:54:17,855 --> 02:54:23,999
Quote on February 14th and 15th 2022 defendants presented Brittany paws as the designated

3222
02:54:24,255 --> 02:54:26,047
Both the Sandy Hook and Fontaine cases

3223
02:54:26,303 --> 02:54:32,447
A review of the deposition transcript shows the defendants flagrantly disobeyed the Court's order in preparing this pause

3224
02:54:32,703 --> 02:54:36,799
As a result she was unable to give a good testimony on any of the topics

3225
02:54:37,055 --> 02:54:43,199
Plaintiffs is now faced 59 appearances a corporate positions on the issues at the heart of their claims despite everywhere

3226
02:54:43,455 --> 02:54:49,599
Remedial action taken by the the court including the severe sanction of default and over 200,000

3227
02:54:49,855 --> 02:54:52,159
Dollars accumulative attorneys fees

3228
02:54:52,927 --> 02:54:59,071
So that was the description pretty good

3229
02:55:00,351 --> 02:55:02,143
145 is the Mendoza Line

3230
02:55:02,399 --> 02:55:04,447
So over 5

3231
02:55:04,703 --> 02:55:10,847
I'm telling you you're still getting pushed back down baseball tonight

3232
02:55:11,103 --> 02:55:14,687
Align

3233
02:55:15,199 --> 02:55:18,783
As a result of this obviously Something's Happened

3234
02:55:19,551 --> 02:55:21,855
And so I'm going to read to you here just from the court

3235
02:55:22,111 --> 02:55:24,415
Filing of the findings

3236
02:55:24,671 --> 02:55:28,255
In response to this

3237
02:55:28,511 --> 02:55:34,655
In addition to obviously in the context of all the other corporate representative

3238
02:55:35,423 --> 02:55:41,567
Don't know how to get to to

3239
02:55:41,823 --> 02:55:45,407
Police thwarted the legitimate Discovery process in these cases

3240
02:55:45,663 --> 02:55:51,807
The egregious missing repetitiveness of defendants obstruction exhibits a disregard for and disrespect of the integrity

3241
02:55:52,063 --> 02:55:53,599
Free of this court in our judicial system

3242
02:55:54,111 --> 02:56:00,255
Discovery of facts necessary to properly present their claims for damages has been irreparably

3243
02:56:00,511 --> 02:56:02,303
Prejudiced in virtually all respect

3244
02:56:03,071 --> 02:56:08,959
Absence of erection from this court defendants will ultimately profit from their sabotage of the discovery process

3245
02:56:09,471 --> 02:56:11,519
The court therefore orders that one

3246
02:56:12,031 --> 02:56:17,663
Pursuant to rule 215b Wanda Court disallows any further Discovery by descendants

3247
02:56:17,919 --> 02:56:22,015
Any obligation of the plaintiffs to respond to any pending Discovery is terminated

3248
02:56:22,527 --> 02:56:26,879
So they don't have to respond to any request Lovett document started

3249
02:56:27,135 --> 02:56:33,279
Depositions

3250
02:56:33,535 --> 02:56:36,863
Howard literary in a place where it's like shut up shut up

3251
02:56:37,119 --> 02:56:43,263
To pursuant to rule 215b to the court orders that defendants she'll pay all of the expenses of the

3252
02:56:43,519 --> 02:56:45,823
Discovery and taxable court costs in these lawsuits

3253
02:56:46,335 --> 02:56:52,479
Play Just Joel submit evidence setting forth any court cost expenses or attorneys fees relating to Discovery or Discovery motion

3254
02:56:52,991 --> 02:56:59,135
Accepting those amounts with their already awarded and any prior order of the Court defendants May object to the amount within 7

3255
02:56:59,391 --> 02:57:02,207
7 days after planting smiling

3256
02:57:02,463 --> 02:57:03,487
Yeah that's a lot of money

3257
02:57:03,743 --> 02:57:04,255
3

3258
02:57:04,511 --> 02:57:06,559
Pursuant to rule 215b 3

3259
02:57:06,815 --> 02:57:12,191
The court orders the designated facts shall be taken to be established for the purposes of the action

3260
02:57:12,447 --> 02:57:18,591
Specifically the jury will be instructed that any factual dispute relating to the following topics will be taken as established in faith

3261
02:57:18,847 --> 02:57:20,127
Favor of the plaintiffs

3262
02:57:20,639 --> 02:57:24,479
Sourcing and research for the videos described in plaintiff's petitions

3263
02:57:24,991 --> 02:57:28,575
Individuals involved in the production of the videos described in plaintiff's petition

3264
02:57:29,087 --> 02:57:33,951
Internal editorial discussions regarding Infowars coverage of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting

3265
02:57:34,463 --> 02:57:36,255
The company's knowledge of the plaintiff

3266
02:57:36,511 --> 02:57:40,095
The audience reach of the videos described in plaintiff's petitions

3267
02:57:40,351 --> 02:57:44,703
The documents produced by the company in response to plaintiff's Discovery request

3268
02:57:44,959 --> 02:57:47,519
Efforts made by the company to preserve potential evidence

3269
02:57:47,775 --> 02:57:48,287
And

3270
02:57:48,543 --> 02:57:51,615
The companys business structure and relationship with other parties

3271
02:57:52,639 --> 02:57:53,151
That's

3272
02:57:53,407 --> 02:57:53,919
Everything

3273
02:57:54,175 --> 02:58:00,319
Pretty much everything that the corporate representative testimony was designed to get like

3274
02:58:00,575 --> 02:58:02,623
The deposition was meant to write

3275
02:58:03,135 --> 02:58:07,231
Give them an opportunity to testify on behalf of the company

3276
02:58:07,487 --> 02:58:10,303
To explain these things provide evidence

3277
02:58:10,559 --> 02:58:16,703
Yeah because of their complete we mentioned some of this a little bit before I pass episode

3278
02:58:16,959 --> 02:58:19,263
Some of these sanctions that they've been hit with what like

3279
02:58:19,775 --> 02:58:21,823
Because of theirs because of this

3280
02:58:22,079 --> 02:58:23,103
What we just went over

3281
02:58:23,615 --> 02:58:27,199
They are now not able to make any claims that contradict

3282
02:58:27,455 --> 02:58:31,551
I mean about all of these a she really does

3283
02:58:31,807 --> 02:58:32,575
Abby

3284
02:58:33,599 --> 02:58:35,903
The summary judgment is f*****

3285
02:58:36,159 --> 02:58:39,743
You know I'd like that's crazy I can't believe that would ever happen but

3286
02:58:39,999 --> 02:58:41,535
Did this is essentially saying

3287
02:58:42,047 --> 02:58:42,815
The plaintiff

3288
02:58:43,839 --> 02:58:44,863
Are right

3289
02:58:45,375 --> 02:58:47,167
In everything that they say

3290
02:58:47,423 --> 02:58:53,567
And the defense has abrogated their ability to defend themselves so just believe

3291
02:58:53,823 --> 02:58:59,967
The plaintiffs tell you it's it's that you had every opportunity to raise objection to stuff and provide

3292
02:59:00,223 --> 02:59:00,735
Add evidence

3293
02:59:00,991 --> 02:59:07,135
You are not going to be able to grandstand on this b******* in court that you've refused to cooperate with the process if

3294
02:59:07,391 --> 02:59:09,695
You if your intention is to like say

3295
02:59:09,951 --> 02:59:16,095
Oh yes sources for these videos let's say for example

3296
02:59:16,351 --> 02:59:19,423
Call and play these games throughout the entire Discovery process

3297
02:59:19,679 --> 02:59:22,239
And then you end up in in

3298
02:59:22,495 --> 02:59:23,007
Court

3299
02:59:23,263 --> 02:59:25,823
For the damages lawsuit and you're like

3300
02:59:26,079 --> 02:59:32,223
I've got this sort of the sources action that actually it's not from their objection your honor

3301
02:59:32,479 --> 02:59:34,271
You don't want

3302
02:59:34,783 --> 02:59:35,551
Like Alex

3303
02:59:35,807 --> 02:59:41,951
Being able to do whatever sort of game he might be wanting to play I mean I think I think it's

3304
02:59:45,279 --> 02:59:49,631
It's necessary a couple years ago

3305
02:59:49,887 --> 02:59:54,495
Probably because we never would have because we you just don't think that somebody would take it this far

3306
02:59:54,751 --> 02:59:56,543
So you didn't do it a couple of years ago

3307
02:59:56,799 --> 03:00:00,127
And then you didn't do it last year cuz you like there's no way they can take it this far

3308
03:00:00,383 --> 03:00:01,151
And now here we are

3309
03:00:02,431 --> 03:00:06,783
I mean this isn't this is a court saying f***

3310
03:00:07,039 --> 03:00:13,183
You somewhat I think there is some value in giving people the opportunities to real

3311
03:00:13,439 --> 03:00:15,231
We make the case against themselves sure

3312
03:00:15,487 --> 03:00:20,607
And I think that has been done quite well in the course of this I mean like

3313
03:00:21,375 --> 03:00:22,143
In terms of

3314
03:00:22,655 --> 03:00:25,727
You know these things that they're not allowed to let's say

3315
03:00:25,983 --> 03:00:27,007
Dispute

3316
03:00:28,031 --> 03:00:28,799
Court

3317
03:00:29,567 --> 03:00:30,079
The

3318
03:00:30,591 --> 03:00:31,871
It would be like

3319
03:00:32,127 --> 03:00:34,431
You'd say hey I don't know if that's right

3320
03:00:34,687 --> 03:00:36,735
If this hadn't all happened

3321
03:00:36,991 --> 03:00:37,759
Do you know m

3322
03:00:38,015 --> 03:00:40,319
The people who disagree with that like people who

3323
03:00:40,575 --> 03:00:45,183
No follow Alex and piggy gets a by the court to believe anything anyway

3324
03:00:45,439 --> 03:00:51,583
I think it's due diligence to like walk through the process of not cooperating and all this

3325
03:00:51,839 --> 03:00:54,655
To get a point where the punishment fits the behavior

3326
03:00:54,911 --> 03:01:01,055
Alright I'm just headed back to the Newsradio references a lot lately but this is just

3327
03:01:01,823 --> 03:01:07,967
That judge saying you have exhaustively proven that this is a box full of junk congratulations

3328
03:01:08,223 --> 03:01:11,807
And it's like I feel like that's where we are if just like yes

3329
03:01:12,063 --> 03:01:13,855
You have exhaustively proven

3330
03:01:14,111 --> 03:01:14,879
That you have

3331
03:01:15,135 --> 03:01:21,279
No idea what we're doing here congratulations and then they're going to say tubal-cain and it's all over

3332
03:01:21,535 --> 03:01:25,887
Forward to Alex calling Uber as a witness

3333
03:01:30,239 --> 03:01:34,335
So are we come to the end of this and I think this was a Who

3334
03:01:34,591 --> 03:01:37,407
Right now I think

3335
03:01:37,663 --> 03:01:43,807
For the sake of the chaos and stuff

3336
03:01:44,063 --> 03:01:50,207
Maybe some stuff people enjoy watching in that links

3337
03:01:50,463 --> 03:01:53,023
I just linked to the

3338
03:01:53,279 --> 03:01:56,863
The YouTube page of there that has all the depositions on it and stuff

3339
03:01:57,119 --> 03:01:58,911
I believe that that should be

3340
03:01:59,167 --> 03:01:59,935
Publix

3341
03:02:00,959 --> 03:02:07,103
By the time this comes out the first one is there the first position

3342
03:02:07,359 --> 03:02:11,711
Is there and I believe that the other one will be by the time this comes out

3343
03:02:12,223 --> 03:02:13,503
Yeah

3344
03:02:14,783 --> 03:02:20,927
And I hope you all enjoyed we promised the laundry episode you got it

3345
03:02:21,183 --> 03:02:23,231
Yeah no kidding

3346
03:02:23,487 --> 03:02:26,559
Website.com

3347
03:02:33,215 --> 03:02:39,359
Three times as much work as I have and that's zero

3348
03:02:39,615 --> 03:02:45,503
Go to bed George

3349
03:02:46,015 --> 03:02:50,367
And now here comes the sex robot
