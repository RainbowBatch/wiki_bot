We are.

12
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:19,616
Sometimes it's dissonant energies are better than complimentary ones

13
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:26,016
For from minor keys in the lake

14
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:32,416

Maybe even just cucumber water you're like cucumber one cucumber Seltzer's assure

31
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:14,560
Cucumber water better than with

00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:18,144
Cucumber on a salad sometimes

33
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,448

There isn't going to be bats I assume that any you think we're that we do is going to require that

40
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:56,288
If you don't like going to put a crimp in your abilities

41
00:03:56,544 --> 00:04:00,384
You tell me if it's a bad pickle or not

Facebook I never see those messages and I owe him a response

66
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:36,127
Along with about a ton of other people here I apologize my God

67
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:42,527
Correspondences the worst thing in the world for me

68
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:48,159
I need to get better at it

00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:52,767
I'm going to get back to you but I got to get back to work and then I remember

70
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:55,327
I got the message so I just assumed

71
00:05:55,583 --> 00:06:01,727
Better if I didn't keep my email open all the time

72
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:11,967
I think I think we might have missed

73
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:13,247
Yeah yeah

74
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:15,295
New strategy

00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:20,415
We're going to be talking about an episode of The Alex Jones Show from

Recording show

81
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,799

Thank you so much

86
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:55,999
Everybody knows they're trained wrong

00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,559
Scrap

88
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,911
Great Neck

89
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:17,247
The number 42

90
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:22,623
Number 42 for the answer to the question

91
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,143
Switzer

92
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,079
Technocrat

93
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,855
Heroin

94
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:06,655
Library library

95
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:12,287
That sounds like a great Bounty Hunter name in The Apocalypse

96
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:14,079
Jen the librarian kind of got that

97
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:19,967
Pioneer Book for a big guy kind of feel to it you know you think of librarians real cool and calm

98
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:26,367
Right

99
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,647
Jordan

100
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,695
I know that you tried

101
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:30,975
To emulate

102
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:32,767
One of my signature sound

103
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,583
I'm going to go and I don't appreciate it I apologize

104
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:41,983
Dick through your your little no no no

105
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:46,079
I don't want to give you what you want

106
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:07,327
If we got two different Jersey

107
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:10,911
Naked people dancing around the pole of some sort

108
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:13,983
Now we got three

109
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:18,591
I think my shirt

110
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,871
I think we figured it out

111
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,575
Two different messages

112
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:33,439
You run the environment or whatever it was

113
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:39,839
And the other one said save the environment or something along those lines

114
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:42,655
Just going to go out on a limb and say that the negative

115
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:47,519
I think the differences are probably

116
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,287
Yeah I would say

117
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,199
Secondary

118
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,735
Compartment in the mailbag

119
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,087
From the show that

120
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:03,903
Send again

121
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:10,047
Appreciate that

122
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,655
We've done a lot of episodes

123
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,447
Remember most

124
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:23,615
I don't even know that Michelle episode

125
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:28,223
205

126
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,879
And now

127
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:35,903
Yoda

128
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:36,671
Bauer head

129
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:40,767
Are we doing that as we enter the episode

130
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,839
Starts off the show

131
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:46,655
Call

132
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:50,239
Sure does not get through calls until a bit into the episode

133
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,007
What is normal

134
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:55,103
Clear

135
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:01,247
Is saying that they're going to put out

136
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:03,295
He's going to put it out

137
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:04,575
Would cause some

138
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,599
Friction

139
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:08,415
Because he doesn't believe vaccines are good

140
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,463
But Trump is saying that this vaccine

141
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,487
Perfect

142
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:15,839
Where are we going to take calls

143
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:22,239
Where we're going to go

144
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:29,663
Specific issue because

145
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,783
Play the clip of trump here in just a moment

146
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:39,391
He has come out and said we're going to have a very powerful

147
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:42,719
Perfectly

148
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:44,767
Well

149
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:47,839
Yeah no s***

150
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,703
Abidjan

151
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,127
Absolutely

152
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,919
Sugar water and people

153
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:07,807
Oh boy

154
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:16,255
I mean it's a metaphor

155
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,279
That's a metaphor though

156
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:20,095
Expression

157
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:26,495
Sugar water later

158
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:32,895
Talking about

159
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:45,695
Using 2nd area because

160
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:47,999
I have a serious question

161
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:50,303
Do any of the colors

162
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:54,143
Correctly point out that Bill Gates already has the vaccine

163
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:57,215
He's had it for years

164
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:01,823
No it's a real problem

165
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:13,343
Is that like easy

166
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:18,975
They were Trump's doing

167
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:24,607
This is going to cut off Bill Gates at the past try cuz Bill Gates who got his vaccine

168
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:29,983
Trouble has no kind of water.

169
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,759
Alright just part of the long game also

170
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,295
It's just that

171
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:49,695
This is all a bad long game

172
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,487
Trump supporting it

173
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:58,143
Wow we never considered that the way out of their antivirus

174
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,679
Actually a placebo

175
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:02,239
Trump is giving people

176
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:04,287
Basically an injection of nothing

177
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:11,711
Cuz you know stupid

178
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,735
To get it

179
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,527
Well of course

180
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:20,927
Propaganda outlet with a creative way to get around the fact that we

181
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:27,327
Will kill you

182
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:33,727
Oh okay

183
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,687
Tries to sell it that way

184
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,711
Probably won't

185
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:48,063
Alex knows what's going on you got it from high-level sources

186
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:54,207
Show me the number out of the bottom of the hour on call specifically

187
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,383
The president

188
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:27,231
So a position on this is really interesting this is black magic

189
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:28,511
And I'm not into it

190
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:33,119
He says Trump is endorsing this vaccine

191
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:45,663
Microchip the Bill Gates wants to put in

192
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:55,391
You know that was his way of rationalizing

193
00:15:55,647 --> 00:16:01,791
In order to bake the Democrats into admitting that they wanted everybody's guns and then nothing would happen

194
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:08,191
It is described as what he's describing as Blackmagic using like

195
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:16,639
It is unfortunate intrusion of reality even by the god-king

196
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:21,759
Is an invitation to retreat further away from reality you know like

197
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:22,783
Even your

198
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:23,807
F******

199
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,647
Unimpeachable leader

200
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:34,303
Who's always right and perfect about everything is saying that we need a vaccine and even then you're like

201
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,583
He's magic trick

202
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,655
Trying to

203
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:41,983
What's the strongest

204
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:46,847
That's just really sad

205
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:49,919
Sad yes but it also makes Alex

206
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:51,711
About the Lord of the Rings

207
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:54,527
Done

208
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,319
Using

209
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:59,391
Endorsing vaccine

210
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:08,607
It's the same

211
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,167
Not literal

212
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:23,199
Restart

213
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:26,271
Search of the dark lord

214
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,903
Our those on the Earth

215
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:33,439
Powers

216
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,487
Controlled

217
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,375
Allegory

218
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:43,423
Stop

219
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:46,751
Original Satan has been destroyed

220
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:01,343
But that's

221
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:17,727
Did he read the silmarillion what is he talking about

222
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:21,823
So big bad guy

223
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:26,687
The beginning of those dudes do the graves at the credit

224
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:32,063
B b b b b

225
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:39,487
Talking about

226
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,279
Prequel

227
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:43,839
Video stop of the battle where the ring

228
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:45,887
Cut off the finger

229
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:46,911
I know

230
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:59,199
He's ever read

231
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:06,623
I would be shocked if he read the silmarillion I'm a huge fan of his Lord of the Rings and I made it through about 3/4 B

232
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,415
I was like

233
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,975
So I would I would avoid it

234
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:11,743
Yeah

235
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:18,143
Or just something that's all

236
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:20,703
What are the rings

237
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:27,103
General Williams

238
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:32,735
William Barr Coronavirus

239
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,319
Cruising

240
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:44,255
Good

241
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,791
Virginia land honest

242
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:46,815
Really

243
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,959
Yeah man

244
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:56,799
And then I'll bring up the hill

245
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:06,015
Started World Order

246
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:14,719
Doesn't matter

247
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:16,511
Do

248
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:23,167
DNR Russia is putting out a placebo Alex thinks it's cool

249
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:30,079
Dictator is now lying to her country

250
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:33,407
I'm injecting them with something that honestly

251
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:34,943
You don't know what's in it

252
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:41,343
It could be whether or not it is

253
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,367
But he's not

254
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:50,559
Is it sugar water

255
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:56,447
Cold

256
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:05,151
Super water

257
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:11,039
Covid-19

258
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,256
Exam good

259
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:30,240
Yeah

260
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:39,712
Sugar water

261
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:41,248
Kill more people

262
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,808
No big deal

263
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:46,368
The problem is the Bill Gates

264
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:47,136
Has

265
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,672
Ideas

266
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:55,072
He has these things but he wants to do like what

267
00:21:55,328 --> 00:22:01,472
Microchip

268
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:05,312
At the same time it will also hit a off switch

269
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:08,896
Junior Burger

270
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:13,760
Morrison

271
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:14,784
I mean

272
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:18,624
There's something sell me on those

273
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:30,656
Turn off

274
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:31,936
Chromosome

275
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:32,960
Number 8

276
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:35,776
I'll look into what chromosome number

277
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,592
Chromosome number 8

278
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:41,920
We don't have chromosome

279
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:47,808
Alright

280
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:49,344
Marshall

281
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:51,904
You're lucky

282
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:57,280
The more power

283
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,584
Stronger

284
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:03,168
This this is a little much

285
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:09,568
How to tell when somebody so transparently full of s***

286
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:14,176
Just nonsense you should have that when you're in 3rd grade that you played that Clifton

287
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:17,504
This is what it sounds like someone somebody is just so obviously full of s***

288
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:23,904
Additions that are associated with known as chromosome 8 monosomy

289
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:28,512
Which is a very rare situation where there's a deletion of a portion of that

290
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:30,816
They would normally get from your parents

291
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:34,656
David Icke

292
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:36,704
This is all just David Icke said

293
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:40,544
There's a

294
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,592
That we're basically the argument is

295
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:46,176
They found something in the PCR test

296
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:47,712
Border covid-19

297
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:49,504
They

298
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,320
Portion of

299
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:57,440
Okay

300
00:23:57,696 --> 00:24:01,280
It's 146 million pair.

301
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:05,632
I don't know how much this

302
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:08,960
Call

303
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:13,056
Actually two versions

304
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,592
1

305
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:16,128
Is that the PCR test

306
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,176
Is looking for this thing

307
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:22,784
DNA

308
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:27,904
In all human DNA going on

309
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,440
So it's in everybody

310
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:32,768
So the test is looking for that

311
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:39,168
Which fails to make sense of why there aren't

312
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:40,448
Not great

313
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:43,008
Now the other one is that

314
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:44,800
For this

315
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:47,872
So they'll have the positives

316
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:49,664
Like

317
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:54,784
Express this in a way that sounds fine coming out my mouth

318
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:58,368
Are making the argument

319
00:24:59,136 --> 00:24:59,648
Zach

320
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:00,416
This

321
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:04,000
River being positive for covid-19

322
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:09,888
Therefore any cure for covid-19

323
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:11,168
Or killing

324
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:13,472
This stretch

325
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:15,776
Of

326
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:20,640
Which is chromosome 8 therefore any cure for covid-19

327
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:22,176
Billete

328
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:23,712
Turn off

329
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:24,992
This chromosome

330
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:28,064
Which is not suffering

331
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:33,696
The ideas are growing out of this as far as I can tell this all traces back to David Icke

332
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:35,488
So I don't

333
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,072
I would love for Alex to sit down and talk a little bit about chromosomes

334
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,472
Extended portion of his show

335
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:46,752
Just name

336
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:49,312
I don't know about that more than you

337
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,920
I have so many more they're so much better

338
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:55,456
He was like

339
00:25:55,712 --> 00:26:01,856
I'm still work better cuz I have more chromosomes than about where he does later say that he's chromosome 8 is particular

340
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:13,888
But I got to go and covid-19

341
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:21,312
He's working as a surrogate for Trump

342
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:23,616
When he's doing this covid-19 denialism

343
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:27,456
Weird I'm uncomfortable with it

344
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:34,880
Everything

345
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:53,056
You have the right about everything in this is also not the first time he ran

346
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:59,456
He's working as a surrogate to put out this b*******

347
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:01,248
Nonsense about coronavirus

348
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:12,768
Hey

349
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:16,096
Right now

350
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:20,704
You see yourself as a campaign surrogate

351
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:22,240
We got our orders

352
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:24,544
And I wouldn't have given those orders

353
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,568
But I've got my order

354
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:29,152
I'm going to do what I'm told

355
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:34,784
So whether or not he's definitely about to talk to

356
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,344
Somebody who probably is an unofficial one that's

357
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:38,624
F****** Rodger cell

358
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:45,280
Rogers news articles that went around recently they were talking about how

359
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:48,096
Said the Trump did

360
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:51,168
All the ballots from Nevada

361
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:55,776
You know take over if the election

362
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:58,848
Rodger Dunn

363
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:02,432
Hey guys I was taking out a contact

364
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:03,712
Media

365
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:04,992
Bastardized

366
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:05,760
Mike Tomlin

367
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:07,040
Symptomatic contact

368
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:09,088
Ignored

369
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:09,856
I said that

370
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:14,720
Insurrection act and martial law

371
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:17,536
Only if there was blatant

372
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:21,120
Evidence of fraud I did not

373
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:26,752
Martial law if he lost an honest election not ever said

374
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:27,520
Anything

375
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:30,592
Clarification

376
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:32,128
Unreal

377
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:37,504
Contacts

378
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:47,232
That this voter fraud was happening

379
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:56,960
Power there's a fair election

380
00:28:57,216 --> 00:29:02,336
Is definition of a fair election is one where Trump win

381
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:05,408
His play to happen is if Biden wins

382
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:11,040
Which is what

383
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:11,808
Your

384
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:19,744
Yeah it dismissed contacts

385
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:32,032
Rodger complains about how poorly treated by the media

386
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:36,640
Experiencing quite a while

387
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:37,920
The media

388
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:40,992
4 years

389
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:44,832
Or reporter

390
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:46,112
Any reporter

391
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:47,392
Any publication

392
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:49,184
Call you

393
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:51,232
When you are

394
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:53,024
You know when you're writing about you

395
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,304
And that has not happy

396
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:57,376
We are awake

397
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,448
Opportunity

398
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,032
What is the signify

399
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:05,056
They're worried about

400
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:09,664
Maria matters Soros

401
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,688
Houses eating

402
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:14,016
So

403
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:16,576
Could you reach out to stone for

404
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:33,216
It's interesting to me that Rodger would be at

405
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:35,264
Complain about people reaching out for ComEd

406
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:39,360
Like I've never seen a war story

407
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:42,176
Sandra Flores

408
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:48,576
Bulshit contract Amarillo literally works for the

409
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:59,584
It's a foreign concept

410
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,424
Brutal

411
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,728
Like that like he's

412
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:08,800
What a f****** a******

413
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:10,592
Yeah I hate it

414
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:16,992
Claims the Trump White House

415
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:18,016
Ideas

416
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:19,296
This vaccine stuff

417
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:21,856
They say

418
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:24,416
No Doubt

419
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,832
What do you think about that

420
00:31:55,904 --> 00:32:00,256
Supreme Court

421
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:10,496
I don't know about that but I do know that we have people

422
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:14,080
Who are

423
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:16,128
Decided

424
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:20,224
So now what

425
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:25,088
Caribou

426
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:27,136
Conspiracy

427
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:30,976
Responsibility

428
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:32,256
I don't know about that

429
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,584
In conversation

430
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:38,912
Alex

431
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:41,472
Because you needs Rodger to be on board with this

432
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:47,616
General

433
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:50,688
But

434
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:56,832
Onto Republican members at work

435
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:04,512
That's fine

436
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:09,120
Still have an opinion on it because

437
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:13,472
To the case at hand

438
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:19,872
There's an interesting thing going on and if you want him to

439
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:33,184
I want to say what I want to say about for the Rodger Stone defense fund

440
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,792
But I don't need anymore

441
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:39,072
That's fair

442
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:41,632
And I just get that

443
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:43,168
Willing to take

444
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:47,520
Some exposure whatever

445
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:50,080
Alex's fake best friend anymore

446
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:53,408
To go off on a conspiracy about the

447
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:55,968
Supreme Court being blackmailed or whatever he like this

448
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:57,504
Too much iron would care

449
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:02,368
You know

450
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:06,976
Harris has been administered

451
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:13,376
Absolutely

452
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:22,848
Rodger helping Alex

453
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,640
Not what he's doing anymore

454
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:32,320
You know just having

455
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:35,136
What is the personality of Joe Biden

456
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:37,696
29

457
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:39,488
Extreme

458
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,280
He's always wanted to be president

459
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:44,352
Is it a person having a conversation with someone

460
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:46,656
Without the need to be like

461
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:47,936
Yeah you're right

462
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,776
Rogers Public Schools in Paris

463
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:54,848
To agree with Alex about that narrative

464
00:34:55,104 --> 00:35:01,248
Yeah I'm going to run for president

465
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:03,808
Your fear of Hillary Clinton is correct

466
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:15,328
This report is being blackmailed

467
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,984
They tell you

468
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:22,752
MO

469
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:28,896
That's so annoying how stupid they are about that stuff because Roberts is opinions that can all really boils down to

470
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,688
Why better

471
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:32,736
You wrote this in crayon

472
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:39,136
I want to agree with you but you did such a bad job when I die

473
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:42,464
History is going to Supreme Court as the dumbest

474
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:46,816
And then you can sue and like better

475
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:53,216
That's what I want from you children Rodgers

476
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:55,264
Babe you're in such a

477
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:57,568
I kept very clear light

478
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:58,336
Like yeah

479
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:02,176
Stupid

480
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,064
In jail

481
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:14,464
He's probably like

482
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:17,536
So

483
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:19,840
And I go through his calls finally

484
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:21,888
Make a call from a guy named liberal

485
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:22,656
Who

486
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:29,312
Text doesn't like

487
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:31,360
He doesn't enjoy too much

488
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:34,176
Going to be one of them because

489
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:36,480
He's he's coming from a place where

490
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:38,528
Man

491
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:40,320
Bill Gates

492
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:41,088
Together

493
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:46,720
Hey Alex

494
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:54,400
Administration

495
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:56,448
6 billion dollars

496
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:57,728
David

497
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:08,224
In my opinion you cannot donate

498
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,528
Organization

499
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:14,112
Where who

500
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:16,672
Actually one of the members

501
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:25,632
It isn't a relationship strong relationship

502
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,472
Putting off again

503
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:30,240
Each other

504
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:33,568
So I'm going to go

505
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:38,176
That sounds bad

506
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:39,456
Alex's

507
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:41,504
Your friends close and your enemies

508
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:47,904
Closer remember couple times

509
00:37:55,840 --> 00:38:01,984
It's just like the trouble in the past

510
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,056
Fresno memory

511
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:09,920
Ministration

512
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:12,736
Donated all this money

513
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:16,320
Bad

514
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:27,584
It should be mandatory

515
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:45,504
He said it's a problem

516
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,088
This is weird

517
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:51,136
This is very strange

518
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:56,000
Yeah I'm very confused

519
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:58,048
Through the prism of calls it opposed

520
00:38:58,304 --> 00:39:00,352
The covering the story

521
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:06,496
Because you can have this in the conversation with call her less weight

522
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:11,872
Lying about that

523
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:15,968
Conversation

524
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:18,528
But then again he did just say the Trump is lying Direct

525
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:19,296
Yeah

526
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:23,392
So there's that question to actually believe it

527
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:25,952
Yeah why is he lying

528
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:31,584
I guess if you never realized it's to pacify the population just like

529
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,144
Putin Putin is doing

530
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,960
So you're saying that you're

531
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:41,056
Dear fearless leader is lying to pacify the population

532
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:41,824
Bright

533
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:46,432
In order

534
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:50,016
Very very strongly against

535
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:52,064
If it works

536
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,112
Trump

537
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:56,416
Might be part of why

538
00:39:56,672 --> 00:40:00,000
He might be too far for him to go

539
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:06,400
He's dancing around this like this

540
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:11,008
Forward

541
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,032
Yeah

542
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:18,432
Is lies about his lies now are not as compelling as my lies about

543
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:25,344
Trump putting out water down and like that

544
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,112
Being

545
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:29,696
Proud

546
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:30,464
Sure

547
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,256
Even with the a exposition

548
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:38,912
Something like this is to get the World Health Organization off his back or whatever

549
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:41,728
Do it

550
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:45,824
To get people vaccinated their requirements like you can't

551
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,640
Go to school unless you've been vaccinated

552
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:51,968
There's a problem for yeah that's

553
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:56,064
I don't know if he'll be able to get around that but Intel there are like

554
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,624
Parts of society that you can't

555
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,672
Gauges

556
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:04,256
Healthcare

557
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:09,632
That really sucks because

558
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:10,400
It next year

559
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:14,752
Because they said we're not going to have a

560
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:17,312
He's lying about that in order to get elected

561
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:21,664
There's not going to be a vaccine everybody knows there's not going to be back

562
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,736
So the only way that the only time here doing which that

563
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:26,528
Is in the Bible Administration so they can

564
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:28,064
Need to go back to take a nap

565
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:30,368
About their anti-vax

566
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:37,024
Lenny's

567
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,072
It sounds like how I get what's going on

568
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:49,824
Prepare

569
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:57,503
You're the CEO of my Patriot Supply survival

570
00:41:57,759 --> 00:42:01,855
Can sales more product

Yep and her to make the most out of this

You know you really got you really got a hike

573

50 MI

00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:14,399
Money

575
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:19,007
Music

576
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:21,567

00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:09,663

Like you said

748
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:42,431
Trump is going to win the election

749
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:43,711
I think it'll be a landslide

750
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:44,479
Orally

751
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:45,759
You'll see is that

752
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:47,039

By the landslide

756
00:54:57,791 --> 00:54:58,303
Voter fraud

757
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:07,519
Creating a pre-emptive narrative

758
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:12,383
Victory outcome of the election

759
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:18,271
After the election

760
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:21,855
Call into question

761
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:24,415
Suspicious the reality

762
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:26,719
To come to life

763
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:31,327
Because of this

764
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:35,167
You're just creating the preamp to track

765
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:41,567

Whatever there

769
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:53,087
If Trump wins

770
00:55:57,695 --> 00:55:58,719
And if you lose

771
00:55:58,975 --> 00:56:01,791
Decry the voter fraud

772
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:05,375
Yep all these ballots being found everywhere

773
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:06,911
Trump's the rightful president

774
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:09,727
Transferring

775
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:12,287
Just such a bummer is this

776
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:15,359
Cuz I don't think

777
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:18,431
But there's no way for them to

778
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:19,199
Deescalate

779
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:28,671
I just can't do it

780
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:30,463
You would think that

781
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:34,559
And I think for a certain segment

782
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:36,607
You're absolutely right there is no deescalate

783
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:40,703
You think about Alex in a lot of

784
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:47,359
You know times in his life

785
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:50,431
More severe in the past

786
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:51,711
6-9 months

787
00:56:57,855 --> 00:56:59,391
And indoctrinated that like

788
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:00,671
I don't

789
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:02,207
Think it's impossible

790
00:57:03,743 --> 00:57:04,767
At 9 he could be like

791
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:06,815
Now we got to go back to our route

792
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:09,375
Rampaul actually is

793
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:17,567
He's a he's a real guy in the Senate has proven track record

794
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:19,615
Jordan

795
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:20,895
You know like I could

796
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:23,967
I couldn't it's not letting just like Bill Barr

797
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:28,575
Hayden and bring up all the Epstein Corrections unless he's doing something that he likes

798
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:30,367
Thinking he can just be like

799
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:34,975
Well we look at all the ways that Trump lied to us and failed us

800
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:36,255
What you can point to

801
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:37,023
Because they did

802
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:38,303
You know like

803
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:45,471
Anymore

804
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:47,007
And Salvage what you've got

805
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:51,103
It's very simple

806
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:52,127
Yes

807
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:53,663
Stole the election

808
00:57:54,175 --> 00:57:55,199
But what are you going to do

809
00:57:56,479 --> 00:58:01,599
We have the reality in front of us that we have

810
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:07,999
You cannot try and get the Supreme Court to overturn the election but doesn't matter

811
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:14,399
The only thing you can do is buy buy survival food keep us on the air

812
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:21,055
Is going to happen right here on Bandit video to probably

813
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:24,895
Original

814
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:30,527
And you could do that there and then I got my arrival

815
00:58:37,695 --> 00:58:38,463
Cool

816
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:45,375
Coronavirus

817
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:51,775
Video. Prussia

818
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:58,175
Exactly.

819
00:58:58,431 --> 00:58:58,943
Austin

820
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:01,247
Probably would

821
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:02,271
As a goof

822
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:04,063
Triad protest for Cary

823
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:06,879
Outside Alex

824
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:13,279
We could get a little Lake area

825
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:19,679
Studio

826
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:23,007
That's a great idea sounds like

827
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:25,823
Alex

828
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:29,407
NSYNC right now

829
00:59:29,919 --> 00:59:31,199
Not too surprising

830
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:41,439
So clear that it's already

831
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:43,231
Come of the election that hasn't happened

832
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:45,535
Another losing this election

833
00:59:48,863 --> 00:59:50,655
No they're losing

834
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:14,719
You have this presentation like everybody knows the Trump is going to win the election but anybody

835
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:15,743
H-E-B arrest

836
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:17,535
That's f***** up

837
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:19,071
Yep

838
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:21,887
Commissary

839
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:24,447
They will not accept

840
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:25,727
I mean

841
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:29,823
Why would they care what an election says

842
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:34,943
I mean

843
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:36,991
One argument against

844
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:38,015
Them being fashion

845
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:40,831
Is the day you want to Outlaw the Rival party

846
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:45,695
That's a really good point they want to do it through the courts

847
01:00:47,999 --> 01:00:49,023
Even if we win this battle

848
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:51,327
Free things

849
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:52,607
2024

850
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:53,887
We have another flight

851
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:55,935
Succession

852
01:00:57,471 --> 01:00:59,007
Please office if he doesn't leave office now

853
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:03,103
Ali's office in 2020

854
01:01:04,383 --> 01:01:06,431
We are coming to interrupt because I want to hear that

855
01:01:26,143 --> 01:01:29,471
That party I got bad news about the Nazi party post-world War

856
01:01:36,895 --> 01:01:38,175
I love the way that he puts

857
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:40,735
We've got another election in 20

858
01:01:40,991 --> 01:01:44,319
44

859
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:50,463
Special election

860
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:55,327
I've heard

861
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:57,119
Conversations in the past or

862
01:01:57,375 --> 01:02:03,519
Monarchy

863
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:07,103
It should be Melania Trump

864
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:12,223
End of the right-wing

865
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:13,759
AR

866
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:16,575
Very close to wanting

867
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:31,423
Our duly elected

868
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:37,311
Like f****** 1776 we got rid of the king

869
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:38,591
Jesus

870
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:44,991
Stinks the Democrat Party is

871
01:02:46,783 --> 01:02:47,551
Because

872
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:48,575
I mean

873
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:52,159
Let's imagine

874
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:58,559
Establishment of the Democratic Party

875
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:07,007
Brewstew

876
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:13,919
The only reason

877
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:15,455
Anybody has any

878
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:18,527
It's to the left of Rand Paul is because

879
01:03:18,783 --> 01:03:24,927
Nancy Pelosi and the Democratic party is there

880
01:03:25,183 --> 01:03:28,511
Democratic party liberal Democrats

881
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:30,303
Now you're just Republican lights

882
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:34,655
As though their policies in the Republican light party or going to change

883
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:36,447
Interesting

884
01:03:36,703 --> 01:03:41,823
For him

885
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:43,871
Like a reality-based

886
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:50,527
Really just the disruption of the apparatus of the Democratic Party

887
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:54,111
It's not what you want to be able to Outlaw political beliefs

888
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:04,351
The funding mechanism for

889
01:04:08,447 --> 01:04:09,215
His give a

890
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:15,871
Uncle

891
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:26,623
It would be it would be better as a system I think if we had more than two parties

892
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:30,975
Has little bearing on my feelings bad become an election

893
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:32,511
I agree with you there as well

894
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:36,351
Because we currently have a situation where the

895
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:39,167
Has

896
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:40,191
God sent him

897
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:45,311
God literally had to give us

898
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:56,319
Human being

899
01:04:57,855 --> 01:04:59,135
You know even just the other day

900
01:05:00,671 --> 01:05:01,439
Philly cheesesteak

901
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:04,255
Silly or something

902
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:06,559
It's a reminder that this is a real

903
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:11,167
What we see on the other side

904
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:17,567
Isn't it amazing that Trump took a picture from selfie

905
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:23,455
I really want dealing with that Trump

906
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:30,367
Well I mean you know what I'm saying like he just gets away with it doesn't have to be doesn't have to respond to that like oh yeah

907
01:05:30,623 --> 01:05:31,391
Super deadly

908
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:32,159
He just doesn't have

909
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:35,231
Have to deal with that

910
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:44,191
I don't think you understand the political

911
01:05:44,447 --> 01:05:44,959
Importance

912
01:05:45,215 --> 01:05:46,495
Of a guy

913
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:48,799
Eating a cheesesteak

914
01:05:49,311 --> 01:05:52,127
And

915
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:57,759
Myself on fire

916
01:05:58,271 --> 01:05:59,807
Any call

917
01:06:00,063 --> 01:06:03,647
Is a very sincere picture of him

918
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:08,767
Famously convinces all false Christians that he was sent by God

919
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:12,095
Interesting

920
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:15,423
When I hear stuff like that

921
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:17,471
Far is so

922
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:20,287
Real, real

923
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:24,383
Stop Bishop feels like there

924
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:26,431
Wasted

925
01:06:26,687 --> 01:06:32,831
It's just so funny to imagine them making fun of someone on the last being like Obama

926
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:41,023
F****** cheese water

927
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:50,239
Yeah they are

928
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:53,567
Interesting thoughts

929
01:06:53,823 --> 01:06:54,335
What's about

930
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:57,151
It is

931
01:06:57,663 --> 01:06:58,175
Current

932
01:06:58,431 --> 01:06:59,711
Not being

933
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:02,271
Super into everything Trump does

934
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:03,807
It's Tricky

935
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:05,087
So long

936
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:07,647
I mean his website I think was really groundbreaking

937
01:07:08,415 --> 01:07:09,439
The format

938
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:12,511
Conservative news for

939
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:13,535
Atlanta

940
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:15,327
You don't have a lot

941
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:16,351
Conservative news

942
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:17,631
Lely it's

943
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:18,911
Control

944
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:20,959
What is maybe four about

945
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:22,751
You're something but lately in the

946
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:26,335
Circulated that story

947
01:07:27,103 --> 01:07:27,871
Initially about

948
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:29,663
The troops losers

949
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:35,039
Urban push there

950
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:38,111
And even this week there were some really terrible

951
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:39,135
Is there

952
01:07:41,439 --> 01:07:41,951
Such a shame

953
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:44,511
We as conservatives are we as

954
01:07:45,279 --> 01:07:46,303
You're probably right wing

955
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:48,863
We don't really have

956
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:52,959
Information

957
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:53,727
Exceptional

958
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:55,263
You and others

959
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:56,287
You and others

960
01:08:01,663 --> 01:08:03,967
Fair and that is at the right

961
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:10,111
Way too much in the Matt drudge basket

962
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:18,559
All boil down to

963
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:26,751
Figure out

964
01:08:27,007 --> 01:08:27,775
If we want

965
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:29,311
To keep promoting

966
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:32,383
A little bit

967
01:08:32,639 --> 01:08:38,783
How can you get rid of

968
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:47,231
Right now where is with with Nick

969
01:08:47,487 --> 01:08:49,023
I think it's an interesting

970
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:51,839
Approach trying to say

971
01:08:56,191 --> 01:08:59,263
These rulers now

972
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:01,823
Trump rumors

973
01:09:03,871 --> 01:09:04,639
Suggestions

974
01:09:05,151 --> 01:09:06,943
Feelings for a little while

975
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:10,271
Drudge

976
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:14,367
Do you think he was using better editorial standards I don't understand

977
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:22,815
Play you still agree with me all the time

978
01:09:24,863 --> 01:09:25,375
Yeah right

979
01:09:25,887 --> 01:09:27,423
It is it is just out

980
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:30,495
It's not a but for them it's the future is like

981
01:09:31,007 --> 01:09:35,359
It doesn't matter if I 100% respected this person and thought he was a god

982
01:09:35,615 --> 01:09:38,431
He disagreed with me and the way that I think things should be run

983
01:09:38,943 --> 01:09:39,711
So now he's against

984
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:43,551
Play they love to act

985
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:48,927
The functionaries who are really easily dismissal

986
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:51,999
You can just throw out

987
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:54,815
Withdrawal

988
01:09:55,839 --> 01:09:57,119
And I think it's because

989
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:03,007
So much of the things

990
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:04,287
Games that are like

991
01:10:04,543 --> 01:10:06,591
Any idea Trump was going to be

992
01:10:06,847 --> 01:10:07,871
Political figure

993
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:09,663
He goes back to like

994
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:10,431
Bill Clinton

995
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:16,831
Drudge

996
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:20,159
Media sphere

997
01:10:20,415 --> 01:10:23,487
Non-stop like to the point where I remember specifically

998
01:10:23,743 --> 01:10:25,535
I can see the Drudge

999
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:30,399
On 911 like I can see it in my head he read it so much

1000
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:36,799
And you can trace a straight line from Judge to so many things but almost anybody like

1001
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:42,943
Beating off The Rush Limbaugh

1002
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:44,735
Headlines

1003
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:54,463
Project Veritas

1004
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:57,535
Okay come from

1005
01:10:57,791 --> 01:11:03,935
That came from behind promotion of

1006
01:11:04,191 --> 01:11:05,215
Career the large

1007
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:09,311
Andrew Breitbart got his start working for Drudge

1008
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:13,663
Breitbart the publication came from Andrew

1009
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:15,967
So much

1010
01:11:16,223 --> 01:11:16,991
Of this

1011
01:11:17,247 --> 01:11:18,271
Miss spider web

1012
01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:20,831
All of media tendrils

1013
01:11:21,087 --> 01:11:22,111
All can kind of

1014
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:25,951
Either directly or spiritually Trace back to the influence of drugs

1015
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:35,423
Which is better

1016
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:36,703
Even if

1017
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:37,471
You should

1018
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:38,239
Save any work

1019
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:44,639
Works for the literal Christian Temple

1020
01:11:44,895 --> 01:11:45,919
Because they have to make it personal

1021
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:50,783
Antagonize Judge Too Much

1022
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:54,111
He's not just going to be like

1023
01:11:54,367 --> 01:11:55,647
In on the sidelines

1024
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:56,671
Supposedly

1025
01:11:56,927 --> 01:11:59,231
He's going to be actively against

1026
01:11:59,743 --> 01:12:02,815
Maybe they're worried The Drudge knows

1027
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:05,375
The game

1028
01:12:05,631 --> 01:12:07,167
Probably true

1029
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:12,287
About on that front but if I were them to

1030
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:16,127
She's kind of like

1031
01:12:16,639 --> 01:12:17,407
Now belittle

1032
01:12:18,175 --> 01:12:22,527
No Outlet promote

1033
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:25,599
Very positive and interesting

1034
01:12:26,623 --> 01:12:27,135
Revolvers

1035
01:12:28,671 --> 01:12:29,439
Exactly who

1036
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:32,255
I've been watching that lately I don't know about you but

1037
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:43,007
Job

1038
01:12:54,015 --> 01:12:55,039
I think it my eyes a little bit

1039
01:12:56,063 --> 01:12:57,343
Gray publication

1040
01:12:58,367 --> 01:12:59,647
I'm not trying to sell it or anything

1041
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:01,695
I'm just saying

1042
01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:06,047
How did Joe wow

1043
01:13:06,303 --> 01:13:09,631
I don't know what the preoccupation is on the right

1044
01:13:09,887 --> 01:13:11,423
With Outlets that have

1045
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:12,191
People

1046
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:17,311
Under fake names are aliases writing them by

1047
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:19,103
Nobody knows who you are

1048
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:23,455
It's just like aggregative

1049
01:13:23,711 --> 01:13:24,479
Tons of headlines

1050
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:27,039
It's a very beautiful

1051
01:13:27,295 --> 01:13:27,807
What's website

1052
01:13:28,831 --> 01:13:33,695
Could have chose a different name for the revolvers already of Music publication

1053
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:39,839
Search for revolver you find out about Stabbing Westward new song

1054
01:13:45,983 --> 01:13:46,751
Not concerned

1055
01:13:47,263 --> 01:13:51,615
I know this is a real website headlines

1056
01:13:52,383 --> 01:13:58,271
These can't be real headlines

1057
01:14:06,463 --> 01:14:10,047
Been a long time

1058
01:14:10,303 --> 01:14:15,423
I'm not Cinderella and I don't mean to impugn their careers it says I've not heard anything about corn and

1059
01:14:16,447 --> 01:14:19,519
Project

1060
01:14:19,775 --> 01:14:24,895
I heard about the Stabbing Westward since 1998

1061
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:30,271
Oh man I have to do

1062
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:35,391
No one remembers.

1063
01:14:35,647 --> 01:14:41,791
The first headline stories about the Stabbing Westward

1064
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:44,095
Everything old is New Again

1065
01:14:44,607 --> 01:14:48,959
Nothing

1066
01:14:55,871 --> 01:15:02,015
Turns out it's the same s*** I did 30 years

1067
01:15:02,271 --> 01:15:05,343
Years ago what's going on here

1068
01:15:05,599 --> 01:15:10,207
Everything old is new dance

1069
01:15:13,535 --> 01:15:17,631
I don't think revolver is necessarily covering my genres of music

1070
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:24,031
Music publication

1071
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:25,567
Pacific

1072
01:15:32,735 --> 01:15:35,039
Music genres

1073
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:42,207

1074
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:43,231
Yeah

1075
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:49,631
Complaints about

1076
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:50,399
Fox News

1077
01:15:50,655 --> 01:15:52,959
Sure hands because they had an interview with

1078
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:55,007
Newt Gingrich that didn't go well

1079
01:15:55,263 --> 01:15:59,359
Right cuz he was lying out of the teeth cuz he started bringing up Soros

1080
01:15:59,871 --> 01:16:02,687
And I think it actually brings up a really important point

1081
01:16:03,455 --> 01:16:04,991
And even just the other day

1082
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:07,551
Fox News

1083
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:09,855

Of the violence were saying

1111
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:10,015
They keep putting the violence

1112
01:17:12,831 --> 01:17:14,623
I'm not sure we need to bring to work

1113
01:17:17,695 --> 01:17:19,231
I was going to say

1114
01:17:24,351 --> 01:17:28,703
I need to be a part of this conversation

1115
01:17:31,007 --> 01:17:31,519
Okay

1116
01:17:41,759 --> 01:17:43,039

1119
01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:48,671
You know

1120
01:17:48,927 --> 01:17:50,975
This is what happened

1121
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:54,047
Fox News

1122
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:56,351
Able to broadcast

1123
01:17:56,607 --> 01:17:58,143
Conclusion of their thoughts

1124
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:03,263
Facilitated

1125
01:18:03,519 --> 01:18:04,799
Conspiracy meaning

1126
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:11,199
These are easy explanations for all these social ills that all goes back to Soros funding

1127
01:18:11,711 --> 01:18:13,247
Of course

1128
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:18,879
Is the fruit of what they have brought into the world

1129
01:18:19,135 --> 01:18:22,463
Right now at least recognized

1130
01:18:22,975 --> 01:18:23,487
OSHA

1131
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:30,143
This belongs on Infowars

1132
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:33,471
Things to the point where

1133
01:18:33,983 --> 01:18:37,823
Are the same thing

1134
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:40,127
Used to be relevant like Newt Gingrich

1135
01:18:40,383 --> 01:18:42,175
Better

1136
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:43,455
You're next

1137
01:18:43,711 --> 01:18:49,855
Even in an interview with Newt Gingrich on Fox News

1138
01:18:50,111 --> 01:18:54,719
It's gone too far

1139
01:18:54,975 --> 01:18:59,071
I wonder is there any times in human history before where people have

1140
01:18:59,327 --> 01:19:01,375
Spider Noah

1141
01:19:01,631 --> 01:19:04,191
And then once what was in the box was released

1142
01:19:04,703 --> 01:19:06,751
They were

1143
01:19:07,263 --> 01:19:09,311
Have you ever heard of anything

1144
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:12,383
Situation like so there's really no way we could have seen this coming

1145
01:19:12,639 --> 01:19:17,503
No I don't I don't know of any metaphor words or Expressions. John

1146
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:20,831
I'm at a loss

1147
01:19:23,135 --> 01:19:27,487
Yeah it's it's I think it's the same

1148
01:19:27,743 --> 01:19:33,887
As that caller bring him and him having to change the subject

1149
01:19:39,263 --> 01:19:41,055
F****** Soros conspiracies

1150
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:43,103
This is your fault

1151
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:47,967
Keep going down this road

1152
01:19:50,015 --> 01:19:51,039
Zora stairs

1153
01:19:51,295 --> 01:19:52,319
If we lie about it

1154
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:55,135
Bright

1155
01:19:56,415 --> 01:19:58,207
Yeah we can't be doing this s***

1156
01:19:58,463 --> 01:20:00,255
Just the sort of

1157
01:20:00,511 --> 01:20:03,327
Parallel examples

1158
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:07,935
Like the limitations of this game

1159
01:20:08,447 --> 01:20:09,471
Just threw

1160
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:15,360
You yourself can tag agency

1161
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:17,664
And not just that but

1162
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:20,480
It's literally just that like

1163
01:20:21,248 --> 01:20:22,272
They don't know what to

1164
01:20:22,528 --> 01:20:23,552
To do when

1165
01:20:23,808 --> 01:20:25,856
What day are sensibly think our allies

1166
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:26,880
Are forced

1167
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:28,160
To deal with reality

1168
01:20:28,416 --> 01:20:32,768
Where is there not you know just like you know just like with Alex and

1169
01:20:33,024 --> 01:20:34,304
The guy on the phone calls just like

1170
01:20:34,816 --> 01:20:37,376
If I am forced to engage with reality

1171
01:20:38,912 --> 01:20:39,936
This is all wrong

1172
01:20:40,448 --> 01:20:41,728
This is just not how it's supposed

1173
01:20:41,984 --> 01:20:44,288
When it happens there like

1174
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:54,784
Now it's

1175
01:20:58,624 --> 01:21:00,928
We did not have time to gather phone calls

1176
01:21:01,184 --> 01:21:07,072
Because we had a guest appearance on a podcast that will be out eventually do we have to record

1177
01:21:07,328 --> 01:21:07,840
Before this

1178
01:21:08,352 --> 01:21:12,960
So apologies but we will have some on our next episode

1179
01:21:15,264 --> 01:21:21,408
Will be back

1180
01:21:28,576 --> 01:21:31,648
If you could please find a local charity or bail Fund in your

1181
01:21:31,904 --> 01:21:32,928
Auraria to help out those be

1182
01:21:33,696 --> 01:21:34,208
God's work

1183
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:39,328
Omnia on Leah on dvx

1184
01:21:39,584 --> 01:21:41,632
I'm Barrel run this I Belong To The City

1185
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:47,008
Alex

1186
01:21:48,288 --> 01:21:49,824
I love your work
