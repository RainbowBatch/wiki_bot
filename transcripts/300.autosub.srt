I used to watch a lot

10
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:37,632
About every few years

11
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:41,216
I'm trying re-watch

12
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:41,984
The entire Bank

00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:48,640
Love lost

00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:55,296
For it like them so much busier now than I used to be

16
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:57,088
What we watching

Disaster

20
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:01,440
No I don't know

21
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:04,000
No I don't think there's a lot there there many things

22
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:06,560
Things from the closest I can come is that I've read

23
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:07,840
Steppenwolf a number of times

24
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:12,448
Separate

Lovecraft

26
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:24,224
Not in the same way that I hear this from people that Game of Thrones is over I've heard a lot of people talking about like

27
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,784
Wait to get back to my yearly re-watch

28
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:33,184
We're all now have the final season

29
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,512
Present stuff like that don't have anything that's on that level

30
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:37,536
Repetition

31
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:41,376
No I have the lights

32
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:47,776

Most of it memorized

38
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:09,280
Just reminding myself of who I once

39
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:11,072

Freakishly large

62
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:02,688
You can do that by going to our website there's a button on there

63
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:03,968
It says the 4th

64
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,504
Appreciate

65
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:11,648
Jordan today I should let you know what the situation we all face in the

66
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,672
Okay

67
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:18,559
So we can talk

68
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,167
We did for Wednesday in episode about the present

69
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:25,471
To the 20th

70
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:27,007
. app

71
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:29,311
Do you want something

72
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:32,127
Is the present day whatever

73
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:36,223
Really you know a lot about the president

74
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:36,991
Present day

75
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:39,295
You're the only person who

76
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:45,695
Vicious like if you were leaving a review on our own show

77
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:51,071
Is bad about the present

78
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:57,471
Listening to his show at the present day is that it's a frustrating experience

79
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:00,287
Transmuted into something

80
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,823
Hopefully decent

81
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:09,503
As I was to put it out

82
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:13,343
I got some updates from

83
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,159
Who is the 21st

84
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,695
Was a crazy show

85
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:23,071
Kind of unfair of us

86
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,375
This this time

87
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:29,215
Crops were fallow and nothing was going on on the show

88
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:31,007
Just missed it by a day

89
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:35,359
Because of our timing we missed the good

90
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:42,271
So I decided he was going on in the 21st

91
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:44,831
Cuz I want to be overly fair to Alex

92
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,879
Okay well

93
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:48,671
The show that was worth covering

94
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:52,255
So today we're covering May 21st and 22nd 2019

95
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:57,375
Is that show was as good as policy wonk

96
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,167
Has

97
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,191
Saturday

98
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:02,751
I just wanted to know where am I putting this on him

99
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:06,591
Everybody right now

100
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:09,919
Milkshake

101
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:13,503
I'm not making this

102
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:19,903
I've just saying you know when people reach out and they have suggestions I listened then sometime

103
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,695
It's

104
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:24,511
Caltex dropped from Today Show

105
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:31,167
It means your body might have given up tonight being ready to die

106
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:36,543
Ultra commercial

107
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:39,871
It's upsetting

108
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:46,271
If you don't have allergies body might have given up and you are about to die

109
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,343
What is the best justification

110
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:53,183
Forever having allergies be a good thing I've ever heard in my entire life

111
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:56,511
So we start out today here on the 21st

112
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,399
Is Jonah in his vibe

113
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:10,591
What kind of stalgic for our old Studio going to go back and forth

114
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,615
Different days

115
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:14,687
So I decided to come into the Stitch Studio A B A

116
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,223
56 years

117
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,271
OpenTable

118
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:22,367
Sedation with back

119
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,903
Irregular

120
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:30,047
What is the news

121
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,327
Information

122
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,887
That would cover my friends

123
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,423
There's a real

124
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:41,823
Depressed Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald

125
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,807
That is that sounds like a diarrhea

126
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:52,575
Andre more than a

127
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,415
Preemptive conditioning

128
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,183
For his audience

129
00:07:59,231 --> 00:07:59,999
Studio

130
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:03,071
Beacon already laid some groundwork of like

131
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,095
Nostalgic

132
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,375
Can sentimental for a

133
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,655
The studio

134
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:08,191
I wasn't broke

135
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:08,959
Right

136
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:11,007
We didn't have to downsize

137
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:17,919
Celtic result Studio on what he used to have

138
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,223
Is it legitimate

139
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,247
Considering how is life

140
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:23,039
Spiraled into whatever

141
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:28,415
Veracity is right now it does seem like something he could be feel like

142
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,951
Yeah I would be

143
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:32,255
The salad days

144
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,791
Just do whatever

145
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:37,375
Marginal celebrities would come hang out with me

146
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:43,775
Brenda naquin all my friends weren't getting milkshakes thrown on them

147
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,823
Milkshake

148
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,895
Is insisting

149
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:50,175
Strong take

150
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:53,247
It's not a take as much as it is

151
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,551
To really over

152
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:56,319
Exaggerate

153
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:59,391
Now that everyone is trying to just

154
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,671
Spy throwing

155
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:05,023
Nigel farage

156
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,607
Yeah tomorrow

157
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:10,911
Interesting real

158
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,447
Stupidly mispronounces

159
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:16,031
Is Nigel farage which leads me to believe

160
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,311
Maybe he's drunk

161
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,335
Or maybe

162
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,615
Just thanks

163
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:20,895
The name is fraud

164
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,703
Authorized

165
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,079
This individual

166
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:57,247
Just individual

167
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:02,367
Crazy Frog

168
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:07,231
Nomenclature equivalent of throwing a milkshake

169
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:10,303
Very unintentionally insulting

170
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:14,655
Twitter has authorized

171
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,703
Authority

172
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:23,103
Correction access

173
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:27,455
I believe I can't remember coming up

174
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,479
Narrative

175
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,527
Narrative

176
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,063
YouTube stories

177
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,855
He's got a very important headline

178
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:41,279
Report

179
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,559
2 years ago

180
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,423
By black man

181
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,495
First thing it's important

182
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,775
Distinguish here is that no one

183
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:52,799
Covered up

184
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:56,895
There was a note that the shooter Emanuel Samson

185
00:10:57,151 --> 00:11:00,223
Left on the dashboard of his car which is file as evidence and not release

186
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,015
The case is current

187
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:02,783
Korean trial

188
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,063
Previously the police

189
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:06,111
Existed but contents

190
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,391
A sealed until trial which

191
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,671
Which is not super on,

192
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:11,487
The note expressed a desire to get retribution

193
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:12,255
For the Charleston

194
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:16,095
Dylann roof is less than nothing

195
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:18,399
The blood that 10 of your kind will Sheridan

196
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,983
Detestable

197
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,519
And using route to justify shoot

198
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,823
Churchgoers is not acceptable on any level

199
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:28,383
Discussing this crime that is not my primary entry

200
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,175
I feel like other news outlets can

201
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,199
Handle that just fine

202
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:35,295
This is important for us covers

203
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,063
The disparities

204
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,343
It's coverage that we can Ferry

205
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,903
In this case the contrast

206
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:40,927
Stark

207
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:43,999
What else is covering Dylan roofs murder of 9 Congress

208
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,279
Of a black church

209
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:50,143
He joked about how is that guy really wanted to kill black people roof should have become an abortion.

210
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:52,447
Any catches coverage largely on that

211
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:54,239
Kind of territory

212
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,775
With regular insinuations

213
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:56,799
The black population

214
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,591
South Carolina riot

215
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,127
In the case of the Antioch

216
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,407
Shooting at

217
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,455
Pure and simple racist

218
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,223
Attack on white

219
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,759
People which the media is tried to

220
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:06,527
The cover-up

221
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,575
Alex does appear to be correct

222
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,599
Inasmuch as this

223
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,879
Antioch shooting

224
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,415
Attack against white people

225
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:15,487
If you were a normal media Outlet covering the story brought that

226
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,535
Detail up I wouldn't really see a problem with

227
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,559
Disgust

228
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,839
The problem is

229
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:20,863
Only covers

230
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:21,631
Because we're White

231
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,655
Our people are victim

232
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:24,703
Crime

233
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:26,239
Which is why it's impossible for

234
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,007
For me not to see

235
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:29,055
That kernel of truth about this attack

236
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,591
Be an expression of a ray

237
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:31,871
Disposition Whitaker

238
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:32,639
Comes out of Alex's

239
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:35,967
So here's what was going on

240
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,503
The Patriot

241
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:38,783
Okay

242
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:41,343
Gave this dude a bunch of drugs

243
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:47,743
He was on a lot of antidepressants that the Patriots

244
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:52,095
And this was entirely too

245
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:59,263
To the threat that you have

246
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,567
Deep intelligence or

247
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:05,919
Conveniently you can't bring up already

248
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:13,343
Beginning first clip that we heard here was Alex

249
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,367
Harkins

250
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,903
Back to his old Studio

251
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:16,671
Wistful

252
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:17,695
Sentimental

253
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:19,743
Give me to believe that the money

254
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,279
Good

255
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,047
As Alex's

256
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,071
Is literally sat on

257
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,607
Our last episode

258
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,399
And it also makes me

259
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,423
Fillmore

260
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,191
Picture of that

261
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:29,983
I hear him do this

262
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,775
Incredibly lazy address

263
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:32,799
For a new product

264
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,407
Now is the most important time to support the info warm

265
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:40,735
My friends there has never been a more critical time

266
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,807
Republic

267
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:47,135
Censorship and attacks are at all-time highs

268
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:52,255
He had his reading voice

269
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,279
Is so different in

270
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,303
Sellmore dispatch

271
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,119
Extemporaneous speaking

272
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:01,727
And so when you hear that you hear the the time the globalist

273
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:03,263
Part of the atom

274
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,335
Consistently what he says

275
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:07,871

An important distinction

280
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,087
Because

281
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:19,647

Bright

287
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:34,495
A part of the ad

288
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:35,775
Yeah most of

289
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:38,079
His rhetoric there is no line

290
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,103
Demarcation

291
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,639

You laugh but I think that's a good name

309
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:41,055
I think we should just

310
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:46,943
Compared to what

311
00:15:54,367 --> 00:16:00,511

Is just a bunch of different words that mean Brave

323
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,303
Formula sounds

324
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,071

It's only 5995 is more than half off out the gate

331
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,039
Either

332
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:58,879
Hyper-inflated base price or we're in real trouble with the money

333
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:06,047
F*****-up thing

334
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:07,327
When I looks closer

337
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:15,263
Likely sounds

338
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:17,823
Not the same thing okay that's weird

339
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:22,687
Website and check the ingredients

Some of it

342
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,319
Kinda similar

343
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:31,391
Like for example probably just going to

For some of the products I was able to

347
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:40,607
The trace to existing things that Alex already

348
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,887
If you're that the new version

349
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,423
Amber just slightly worse for

00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:44,703
Missing ingredient

This is business important

361
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,375
Two supplements he doesn't produce them

Manufactured

365
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:26,175
On the products he doesn't produce in house by law

366
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,967
He has to put manufactured

367
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:28,735

368
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:31,039

A company called natural remedies private Limited

379
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:53,311
Which is a good indication that they were the ones who met

380
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,079
Manufacturer is

00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,103

Address the unmet

Animal Health industry

395
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:41,439
The article describes the beginning of how the company came to be

396
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:44,255
Intrigued by the Alchemy of neem

397

To the world

400
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:56,287
Years later a rough patch came in Shriram laws life

401
00:19:56,543 --> 00:20:00,895
When his beloved horse died who could have been helped by the herbs

402
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:02,431
This Bitter memory

403
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,199
Closely

404
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:06,015
Farmers in treating animals

405
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,039
Stimulated

406
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:07,807
Fill this Gap

407
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,087
Aqr the ale

408
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,111

Volume

410
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:12,927
Infusing the knowledge

411
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:13,951
Which of aggravated

412
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:17,023
That's how the company

413
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,303
It wasn't

414
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:24,703
Religious

415
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:28,799
Natural healing

416
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:29,823
In Tradition

417
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:33,151
Elementary

418
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:34,431
If it's not strict

419
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,199
Flea religion

420
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:36,479
Cultural

421
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,247
In his defense

422
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:41,855
Penicillin

423
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:50,815
Dylan

424
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,399
What makes products or animal health

425
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:56,191
Like their product

426
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:58,495
Which is a topical spray for bovine

427
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:02,079
A few years back that dude started human side of the business

428
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:04,383
20%

429
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,407
Of their market share

430
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:06,687
Their business

431
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:07,967
Largely

432
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,271
It's just Alex Jones

433
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:12,319
Goop

434
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:16,159
There's no real problem with sourcing your products from an Indian veterinary medicine

435
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,952
Do heavy

436
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:19,744
I Wing to their business

437
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:24,864
Few questions mostly because this is Alex

438
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:31,264
We do know that the history of treating veterinarians like human doctors in selling a product that Alex did with doctor told

439
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:36,128
Like who Veterinary

440
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,176
Another issue that Alex

441
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:41,504
Displays made in America

442
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,552
For America

443
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:44,320
Can Industries

444
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:48,160
India to get different version

445
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,184
Many of the products

446
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,232
He already sells manufactured

447
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:52,768
Particularly from a business

448
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:55,072
Primarily Veterinary Health Market

449
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:58,656
He leads one to believe that maybe my other manufacturers wooden

450
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,424
Work with him

451
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:02,240
But that's just conjecture I'm not entirely sure what

452
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:03,264
What the situation is

453
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:09,408
Yeah well I mean 5995

454
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,224
His overhead

455
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:14,272
It's probably almost

456
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:15,296
Hayirli ship

457
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:17,088
Just to get it from India

458
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:17,856
I would imagine

459
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:18,624
It's like once

460
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:23,744
It can't be

461
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,816
You must be making a profit on 5995

462
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:28,096
Which makes you

463
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:29,120
Really question

464
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:30,144
How much

465
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,680
That's what I'm saying

466
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:33,728
109

467
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:35,776
3995 shipping

468
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:38,592
From India to have $0.01 for the product

469
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:41,408
UB gets even twenty bucks

470
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:43,968
Yeah that could be I don't know

471
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:47,808
Literally no idea but I find this very weird

472
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,344
I think the thing that lied to me

473
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,368
Down path of life

474
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:51,904
2D dynamic

475
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,184
What's the

476
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,720
It's so many of the elements

477
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:55,488
So the products are

478
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:56,512
Things that he already sells

479
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:57,280
Yeah

480
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,560
It just seems like

481
00:22:59,072 --> 00:22:59,840
If you are

482
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:01,120
If you're selling this

483
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:03,424
And it extensively helps you with

484
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,472
Sleep and it gives you a nootropic

485
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:10,336
Why would anyone buy any of your other products if they can get them all in this pack

486
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:12,384
You're undercutting yourself

487
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:15,712
Are you under cutting yourself

488
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:16,480
Cutting

489
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:17,248
Exactly

490
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,552
Please Network my doctor group anymore any

491
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:22,624
Simulacra still from

492
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:26,208
I'm not sure that all of them are but

493
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:28,768
Clearly

494
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:30,560
Labels

495
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:31,840
I don't know his business

496
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:33,120
This is really weird I can't

497
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:43,872
Probably do something about that

498
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:46,944
21st

499
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:47,712
Alex

500
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,760
Very into

501
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:52,064
Shity

502
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:52,832
YouTube Somali

503
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:59,232
No longer giving it up to the Somali pirates know there is an irony they are for

504
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:03,072
Sure Somali pirates

505
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:06,144
She has some stories about Molly that he wants

506
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:07,936
Somali immigrants

507
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:11,776
To do that

508
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:13,824
Long time

509
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:16,128
Making fun of the idea that

510
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:18,176
People made that Bon Iver

511
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:24,576
We love long ago

512
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:29,440
Was a bad idea Alex's going

513
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,840
He's dangerous

514
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:39,168
Pizza

515
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:40,448
Propaganda

516
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,008
Do you offer him

517
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:44,544
For no reason

518
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:48,896
Are you understand

519
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:51,456
The thing about it is that he

520
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:53,248
Silk

521
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:54,528
Could never

522
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:58,624
Have the creativity necessary to make something like that

523
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:03,488
They like

524
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:09,888
He can

525
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,168
Continually

526
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,240
Use that because it is defective you know like

527
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:17,312
He would never have been able to make that

528
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:21,408
He could never it would never exist

529
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,200
I think we've made that point a little bit

530
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:24,736
It's just s***

531
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:28,320
He plays the music video

532
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:29,600
David

533
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:30,624
Dispersed with

534
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,160
Pieces of

535
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:33,184
News that

536
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,464
Misrepresented

537
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,744
Molly's being terrifying

538
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:38,304
And doing

539
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:43,424
The objects of eyebright haha

Minneapolis

543
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:51,872
Start singing

544
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:58,784
Where is Minneapolis

545
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:06,720
Here

546
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:08,256

Kia

550
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:05,088
Nobody called 911 immediately after hearing that in the studio we have a psychotic break

551
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:05,856
Occurring right now

552
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:15,584
Sincerely

553
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,424
I'm worried for your safety

554
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,728
And I'm worried help

555
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,520
I don't know but

556
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,312
What are you talkin about

557
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:28,640
Kids of hammers will get into later that's a news story that

558
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:29,408
He's covering

559
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,432
Quite aggressive

560
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:35,296
Lyrics to the parody song

561
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:36,576
A m

562
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:38,624
12th Street

563
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,184
Yeah so I refuse to watch whatever you

564
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,976
YouTube video Alex is talking about there at the beginning

565
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:45,792
Because we wasn't surprising to me at all

566
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:46,560
He just pretending

567
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:51,680
I generally refugees are people who are not leaving their home country cuz there looks

568
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:52,960
Looking for a change of scenery

569
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:54,752
They're fleeing would often represent

570
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:55,520
Mortal Danger

571
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:56,544
And their only hope

572
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,824
Survival is to get out

573
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:01,664
Are countless examples of this re-entry from the Tutsis in Rwanda

574
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,224
In the nineties for the people in Darfur in the

575
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:04,992
2000

576
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:07,296
Be genocide

577
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:10,112
Existential

578
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:18,048
Without living through something like that it's very hard to assume what your mental state might be once you reach a country that represents

579
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:23,680
All the one-handed probably be thankful that the threat of the intercom way or the

580
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:25,472
But on the other hand

581
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:27,008
Good the country you end up in

582
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:31,360
Is not but even if it were it would never

583
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:33,408
It may never feel like your home

584
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,456
Parentheses they're not just leaving a

585
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:38,784
Piece of land in another

586
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:42,112
Regions where they and their families made that generations of memories and

587
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,744
Heather ham just separate from that place that was their home in a deeply traumatic way with no

588
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,280
Tunity to process the separate

589
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:52,096
It makes total sense that part of what makes me rent

590
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:53,632
Do Jeeps. So difficult

591
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:56,960
Is a feeling that may never go away of wanting to go back

592
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:58,752
To home that may no longer exist

593
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:02,848
It's not a longing to leave in a war-torn country cuz America sucks so much

594
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,384
It's a long to go back to

595
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,920
To home they loved before this

596
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:07,968
Circumstances arose that required

597
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:09,760
So when Alex points

598
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:15,392
Somali refugees in Minneapolis who said they want to go back to Somalia I don't feel like that's weird at all

599
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,928
Nor is it any sort of two nuns

600
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,488
Nation of America or display of ungrateful

601
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:20,512
Disrespect

602
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,304
It really feels like what being

603
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:26,400
Expressed fears more an example of Alex's inability to feel empathy or understanding

604
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:27,680
For other people

605
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:33,312
Because

606
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:34,336
Tamales

607
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:35,104
Is Betty hate

608
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:35,872
It's so much

609
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,920
Don't want to be in America

610
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:39,456
That

611
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:43,296
Would be expressing

612
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:49,696
America

613
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:51,488
Cuz I don't know if I

614
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:52,512
Kim

615
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:55,328
Articulate myself

616
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:01,472
Right

617
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:02,240
To be in the

618
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,032
And

619
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:08,384
In their penis

620
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,152
Why

621
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,992
He's trying to represent

622
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:14,272
Is it

623
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:16,064
These Somali immigrants

624
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,344
As well as Omar

625
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:20,160
To be back in

626
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:21,952
Bloodthirst

627
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,488
Rapacious

628
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,024
Violent

629
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:28,096
Come over here in order to

630
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:28,864
To create

631
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,400
Here at the behest

632
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:31,424
Of the globalist

633
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:32,960
To create

634
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:37,312
A clash of civilizations in order to bring down the West

635
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:38,336
What's behind

636
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:39,360
What you saying

637
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:40,128
Okay

638
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,944
Why they're here though they wished

639
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:43,712
To be there

640
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:44,992
That's the version that

641
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,552
The idea of

642
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:48,576
That is

643
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:50,624
Is their home country

644
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:52,928
Longs for

645
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:55,744
The better days

646
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:57,024
He's not thinking

647
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,816
Looking like oh how can we help them

648
00:30:59,072 --> 00:30:59,584
Get back

649
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,888
I don't think so

650
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:08,288
Absent absent from

651
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:12,640
Be thrilled for

652
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:16,736
Deportations

653
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:18,528
Hey wife

654
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:21,856
Stop here in a minute

655
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:22,880
Cuz Alex

656
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:24,672
Hellboy

657
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:29,024
Very not true story

658
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,840
About David Knight and his wife going to an anti-abortion

659
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:40,544
Abortion

660
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:53,344
Baby

661
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:56,160
5150

662
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:59,744
Yeah yeah

663
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:08,448
I know that didn't happen

664
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:12,800
The only people that I ever really

665
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:15,872
You're talkin about virtue-signaling or his friend

666
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:17,408
Alex

667
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,224
People who make accusations

668
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,040
At least that I can see I'm not saying the people on the left

669
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:23,808
Don't

670
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:24,832
Necessarily

671
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:27,904
Call something virtue-signaling but I would say it's a very small piece

672
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,928
The pie

673
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:29,952
It's sad

674
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:37,120
The people who say virtue-signaling are often the people who need you to be signaling as opposed to actually

675
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:40,192
Be virtuous in order to kind of feel better about them

676
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,472
It appears

677
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:46,080
Is Molly stuff a little bit quicker

678
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:47,104
Then you might have thought it

679
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,664
It was just a short little trip down

680
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:51,200
Side roads

681
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:53,248
To hear of fake story about David nightmares wife

682
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:54,528
So

683
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:56,064
Alex is on the warpath

684
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:57,856
As it were

685
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:58,880
Somali immigrants

686
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:01,440
A particularly representative all Barbie

687
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:03,488
Ringleader

688
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:04,768
Sure why not

689
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:09,120
Yet he's focused in on Mini Apple

690
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:10,144
Because there's a large

691
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,680
Somali population in Minneapolis

692
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:12,448
What Saint Paul

693
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:16,032
There is a reference

694
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:16,800
About him

695
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:19,104
The kids and

696
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:21,152
He touches on that

697
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:23,968
Terrifying

698
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:25,248
Of Affairs

699
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:26,528
Minneapolis

700
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:32,416
Minneapolis

701
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:33,952
Population of fair

702
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:39,072
Where you have a tax

703
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:41,376
Little babies being thrown off balcony

704
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:47,520
Tried to cover it up

705
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:50,336
That story

706
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:51,616
He's telling about a baby

707
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:56,224
Being thrown off a balcony

708
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,784
He's lying with contacts

709
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:02,880
Your five-year-old boy was thrown off the third-floor balcony

710
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:03,904
Can you get the Mall of America

711
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:07,744
Responsible with 24 24 year old named Emmanuel Aranda

712
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:09,280
Rhonda was born in

713
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,048
Chicago

714
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:16,448
Is not relevant to Alex

715
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:19,520
Contacts

716
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:25,920
This clip existen on the show that's what that's what

717
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,712
Mogadishu

718
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:30,016
Sew-in 22

719
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:34,624
All right there's a good portmanteau

720
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:36,672
Darondo is

721
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:39,488
Convicted twice for assault that happened at that mall

722
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,048
Once water in one

723
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,352
On women who rejected his advances

724
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:47,680
These assaults lied to him being banned from the mall with fairly did

725
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:50,240
Arrived at the mall in April

726
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:51,520
Intending to kill an adult

727
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:52,800
That quote

728
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:53,568
Workout

729
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,896
He chose to throw the child off the balcony and kind of a win

730
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:58,944
When asked about it then

731
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:03,040
Defended indicated that he had been coming to the mall for several years and had made efforts

732
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:05,600
To talk to women in the mall

733
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:08,416
Caught them to lash out and be aggressive

734
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:12,256
Well obviously it's awful that anyone would throw child off a balcony

735
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:15,328
It's kind of clear that this story is not about immigrants

736
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:16,096
It's not about race

737
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:16,864
Violence

738
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:17,888
It's about a man

739
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:19,168
Entitled to women

740
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:23,008
And when he didn't get what he wanted he responded with violence

741
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:28,384
Salter more than enough

742
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,944
To establish a pattern here and is only explanation

743
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,224
For his action

744
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:33,248
Confirms that

745
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,808
I was just completely lying about the story and you can

746
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:40,416
By the way

747
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:42,464
He's willing to use whatever he can

748
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,512
Defend his whites are under attack narrative

749
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:46,304
Regardless of how the stories

750
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,352
Fit or don't fit into that

751
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,120
Meredith

752
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:50,400
Because he's white National

753
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:54,496
Insidious things

754
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:56,288
Almost

755
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:57,824
Almost

756
00:35:58,592 --> 00:35:59,616
As an undercurrent

757
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:01,664
Through everything that he

758
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,456
Claims about any violin

759
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:05,760
It is always

760
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,064
Excuse for talks

761
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:09,088
Masculinity

762
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,136
If it is not a ritual

763
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:12,416
Thanks

764
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:17,024
It is always like it if it's if it's

765
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:22,912
Racism

766
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:23,936
Masculine

767
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:25,216
You know all that stuff

768
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:26,752
Yeah

769
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:29,056
Media coverage

770
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:31,360
Golf Course

771
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:33,920
To touch on this story but it's also hard

772
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:34,688
Back to

773
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:36,480
What do you think about earlier with

774
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:37,248
The kids of hammers

775
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:40,320
Sew in

776
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:42,624
Most of the coverage I can find about that story

777
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,392
About

778
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:46,464
A gang of Somali youth attacking people

779
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:49,024
Minneapolis

780
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:50,560
Pretty f*****-up

781
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:51,840
Editorial tone

782
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:54,912
I posted the American Thinker accuses the media and police

783
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:56,192
Lisa covering up the attack

784
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:58,496
But it does so kind of tips are handled little

785
00:36:59,008 --> 00:36:59,520
Quote

786
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:01,312
Now that the Old 97

787
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:07,712
Percent plus Caucasian

788
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:12,320
Thursday's ultra-protective of its prized

789
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:17,440
Diversity in Dowling Somali I would like you to rewrite that from start to finish

790
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:20,512
And then go hide in a barrel of water

791
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:22,560
Call r.j.

792
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:23,840
The media is covering up the attack

793
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:26,400
Buy a piece of

794
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:29,472
The article

795
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:35,872
Representative ilhan Omar who represents Minneapolis most ungrateful people we've ever offered ref

796
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:40,992
How about we go to a barrel

797
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:41,760
Haha

798
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:42,784
Jump into it

799
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:43,808
And here's a milkshake

800
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:52,256
It's her responsibility now to behave exactly how

801
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:55,584
Call Ralph

802
00:37:56,352 --> 00:38:02,496
Don't you remember on every white man it's written if anybody not white is not grateful

803
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:05,568
The guy who runs insta

804
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:07,616
The pond at the cries of the media wasn't putting

805
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:08,640
The teen's alleged

806
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:10,432
It describes nationality

807
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:11,200
Their headline

808
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:13,504
Instead they were small

809
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,320
Showing gratitude to the

810
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:18,112
There's a super consistent

811
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:19,648
Trendon all this coverage

812
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:21,440
Be centered around the idea that one

813
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:22,976
We shouldn't be accepting refugees to

814
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,608
They should live here as subservient

815
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:30,400
In order to show their appreciation to

816
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:32,192
Do the white people who let fear

817
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:36,032
And that's a really sucked up thing and it's more f***** up how consist

818
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:40,128
And it isn't that I've read about this story

819
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:40,896
We

820
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:45,248
Let the bright everyday I think to myself thank God that I let

821
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:46,784
Carol live

822
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,320
Thank God that I let

823
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:52,160
Don I like you

824
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:55,744
As far as I can tell this story May well be

825
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:56,768
Have a group of youths

826
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:57,792
Possibly Somalian

827
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:02,912
It's possible but also these commentators

828
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:05,216
Bitrode all these blog post that I've read

829
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:08,288
They're just working office

830
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:11,616
The police dispatch recording it was released that they were looking

831
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:12,640
For 11:50

832
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:13,408
Small

833
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,480
But that's just based on where people who called 911

834
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:18,272
That doesn't mean they're

835
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:22,368
Person who called 911 describe them that way

836
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:28,768
These people could be right

837
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:29,536
Describe people

838
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:35,936
Especially if you were in a Somali refugee

839
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:37,728
Population

840
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:38,496
There's an inn

841
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:40,288
A very good chance that literally

842
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:43,872
Anybody brown that you see anywhere you might just assume is tomorrow

843
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:47,712
We're not that is the case

844
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:48,736
Just a possibility

845
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:54,624
Eyewitness News

846
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,160
It's irresponsible for these

847
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:57,184
But these blogs

848
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,232
To be demonized

849
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:04,352
Somali community and all immigrants apparently

850
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:05,120
Based on

851
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:06,912
Non concrete reporting

852
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,472
So if it's accurate and it was a group

853
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:11,776
Smiley team threatening people at a bus station with pipes

854
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:14,080
Describing it hammer

855
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:15,616
They should be arrested

856
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:17,664
I don't know if it's Ruth justify demonized

857
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,688
Tire small earrings

858
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:24,064
But what's important is that these people like Alex and all these Publications

859
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,344
They don't care about this story

860
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:28,160
They care only so much as they can use it as a prop to

861
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:29,184
Nice immigrant

862
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,720
Attack Elon Omar

863
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:32,512
The bygone

864
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:34,560
Peaceful days when their cities were 97

865
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:38,400
That's what's going on here

866
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:39,168
Group that should

867
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:39,936
Speed Demon

868
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:40,960
In this story

869
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:47,616
Teams because there are roving bands of youth's everywhere.

870
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:49,920
Teens are underfoot

871
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:51,456
They're everywhere

872
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:58,624
M35 anti

873
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:02,720
Very protein

874
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,840
When I was 12 that ever since

875
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:09,120
So

876
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:12,960
We jump off these Smiley narratives here

877
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:15,008
Anything that he gets into

878
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:20,896
Especially because of how it ends up laying out

879
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:22,432
Alex

880
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:25,504
Is responding to a story it's right-wing blogs

881
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,296
Consider attacking Bernie Sanders

882
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:28,320
Because

883
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:30,368
He held up a chicken

884
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:33,184
Weighing or a drumstick

885
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,488
Take a picture with a man who happens

886
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:38,048
African American

887
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:51,360
This is why it's interesting

888
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:54,943
These right-wing blogs are talking about that as if it's

889
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:56,735
I'll look at this racism

890
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:59,295
But Alex's take on it is

891
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:00,575
Come on guys

892
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:02,367
What yeah

893
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:03,391
No

894
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:04,415
He's version of it

895
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:05,695
I hate Bernie

896
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:06,463
But you guys

897
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:08,511
You doing stuff like that

898
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:10,047
It's very

899
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:12,863
It's very weird I promise

900
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:16,447
It's super weird but how it ends up playing out on this episode

901
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:20,031
It gets you back to normal.

902
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:21,055
Even ask

903
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:21,823
He's defending

904
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,359
Bernie Sanders about there

905
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:25,407
It does seem that he

906
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:28,223
He gets a little racist on his own

907
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:29,503
It's 2

908
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:30,527
You'll see

909
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:32,575
Bernie Sanders

910
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:36,927
He's at a restaurant showing off

911
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:37,695
Somebody

912
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:42,815
My mouth water just thinking about drumstick

913
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:47,423
Also a little bit later I didn't try to clarify this but Alex is like

914
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:50,495
You talked about the story a little bit more and he's like guys

915
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:55,615
So I can go get some pasta

916
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:57,663
This app to another layer rate

917
00:42:58,687 --> 00:42:59,455
Number one

918
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:00,223
Guns

919
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:03,807
Most important fact number two we thought was racism

920
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:05,599
Actually number two

921
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:11,743
Food trumps racism it does a little bit

922
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:14,815
See that you got that's all you need to know

923
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:41,183
About

924
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:46,559
Real racism when black people

925
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:48,607
I don't know that ended well but

926
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:55,007
Alright so that was that was a real I was a real Dan Harmon story Circle kind of situation

927
00:43:55,519 --> 00:44:01,663
Feel like you're on good territory where you're saying everyone loves chicken then

928
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:03,967
Graduated

929
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:04,991
Just don't know

930
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:08,319
Introduction

931
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:12,415
Pieces

932
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:19,071
This is a pretty great

933
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:24,447
No

934
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:27,007
Delivery

935
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:30,079
Popeye's Chicken

936
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:33,151
But we'll get to that

937
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:37,759
Middlesex Corp no

938
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:39,551
Think there's a strategy

939
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:43,903
But in the next without starts talking about the

940
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:46,719
A little bit of a conspiracy

941
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:47,999
About weather

942
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:51,839
Chemtrail stop

943
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:59,007
Establishment wants me off the air

944
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:03,103
Is because we have a fighting spirit

945
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:05,663
And we believe we can change things

946
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:07,455
We've done that

947
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:10,015
Thanks to the audience the steak

948
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:13,855
Successful

949
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:18,719
When I was going to do really during this little 5 minutes

950
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:28,959
Or really make that point sailing Italy

951
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:30,495
And post it

952
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:34,335
Westside Players called action

953
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:38,175
Whatever happened to the environment

954
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:40,991
Almost everyone I know in Texas

955
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:44,319
Outside

956
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:55,327
Whatever Texas

957
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:58,143
Black screen

958
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:01,983
Real reason

959
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:06,591
Future

960
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:09,663
Please do new California

961
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:14,527
We are basically toilet bowl of China

962
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:16,575
So this is weird

963
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:18,111
I think he's just talking

964
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:19,135
Complete s***

965
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:20,927
Because here's the thing Jordan

966
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:23,487
The Texas commission on Environmental Quality

967
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:25,279
Stanley statistics about air pollution

968
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:29,119
Records that are easily available online

969
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:31,679
Obviously things very day today

970
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:33,471
Sources of air pollution work that way

971
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:35,263
But if you look at the data

972
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:39,615
Are getting worse

973
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:41,151
In the last year's

974
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:42,431
Because of China

975
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:43,967
Dumping things in the Jets

976
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:47,039
I know what you're saying

977
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:51,135
Standard reported in April of this year

978
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,415
Some cities is getting worse

979
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:53,695
It's getting better another

980
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:57,023
Uncle talks to Janice no

981
00:46:57,535 --> 00:47:00,607
Can you put that the annual state of the air report looking at air pollution

982
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:01,375
Send levels in America

983
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:02,655
Insidious 2019

984
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:06,495
If there was one

985
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:07,775
Worsening air condition

986
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:08,543
It's climate

987
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:12,895
With warmer weather temperatures the more weather patterns that lead

988
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:15,967
To Drought which leads to wildfires which creates smoke

989
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:19,039
In fog

990
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:20,831
Just definitely affecting air quality in the

991
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:22,111
It's not even real

992
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:24,159
Houston has been pointed at as April

993
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:28,255
Particular hotspot of bad air but the recent years were hurricane Harvey

994
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:31,583
And that fire at in the Deer Park petrochemical plant

995
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:35,935
Insane amounts of fine particle pollution

996
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:41,567
Never shutting up

997
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:42,847
Also the Jets

998
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:44,639
Stream is not a stationary thing

999
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:46,943
It's not like

1000
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:50,783
It's not like it's starts in China picks up some smog carries it over the

1001
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:53,855
Pacifica just drops it down over Alex's house

1002
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:55,903
I think he's almost a rainbow

1003
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:56,671
You know like

1004
00:47:56,927 --> 00:48:03,071
Like the jet stream dips down whatever it is

1005
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:07,167
Think that

1006
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:08,191
If you had the right

1007
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:11,263
He could just jump in China

1008
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:13,823
Need to get home

1009
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:26,623
Trying to find out

1010
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:32,511
I don't know what do you think

1011
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:33,279
To be representing

1012
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:36,095
It's very childish version of how weather patterns

1013
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:37,375
The jet stream

1014
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:40,447
Studies that attract Chinese pollution

1015
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:42,495
West Coast

1016
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:44,031
The jet stream dips down in Texas

1017
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:45,311
Just dropped off Johnny's Belushi

1018
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:47,359
There's some indications of pollution

1019
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:49,919
From the California wildfires definitely reach

1020
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:54,015
But from what I can tell Alex is stretching a little bit

1021
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:55,295
Cuz he's talks

1022
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:58,879
Quite a bit about his allergies

1023
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:02,719
Like this is like carries Bell's palsy

1024
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:08,351
Definitely not that I

1025
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:10,911
At the Palmer weather

1026
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:12,703
Gaylord weather

1027
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:17,055
We know that Alex has been very wishy-washy about

1028
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:18,335
In the past

1029
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:23,967
Month very very much turning on him and then saying I love him

1030
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:30,623
For sure has landed I mean I'm sure within a month he'll say f*** this guy again tomorrow

1031
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:32,927
Because Trump has made some in

1032
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:34,719
Medications that he's going to

1033
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:35,999
Try and force

1034
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:39,583
Quotes on social media platform

1035
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:42,655
And all that I think Alex has decided

1036
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:45,471
We're going to move forward with a pro Trump

1037
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:46,239
Opposition

1038
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:51,103
And in order to reinforce that one of the things he has to do is he has to try and chip in

1039
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:51,871
2

1040
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:53,407
The people who have

1041
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:56,735
Next clip

1042
00:49:57,503 --> 00:49:59,039
He is trying to make the argument

1043
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:00,319
Support

1044
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:01,087
Straub

1045
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:03,135
He is turning on him

1046
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:04,415
As is Fox

1047
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:23,871
Obviously

1048
00:50:25,663 --> 00:50:26,687
I know for a fact

1049
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:30,527
That there's a litmus test going on

1050
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:33,343
On whether people will accept

1051
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:35,391
The removal of president

1052
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:36,159
Trump

1053
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:37,439
Or not

1054
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:39,743
So if Alex knows for sure that there's a

1055
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:41,279
Litmus test going around Fox

1056
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:47,679
Haven't gotten fired

1057
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:49,471
Support

1058
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:53,055
Very similar to ours they're clearly secretly behind the

1059
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:54,335
Willing to

1060
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:55,359
To turn on him

1061
00:50:55,615 --> 00:51:00,223
If the globalist to remove Trump from power so therefore

1062
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:01,759
Even though they look like the most

1063
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:03,551
Zephyrus Trump supporters around

1064
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:06,367
Alex is the only real deal in town

1065
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:12,767
Alex

1066
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:18,399
The deuce is loose

1067
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:19,167
He is

1068
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:20,959
Denying The Patriot

1069
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:23,775
The populist movement

1070
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:25,055
God

1071
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:31,199
Piro Jeanine Pirro clearly isn't even travel

1072
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:33,503
I don't know if you still wanted to know who he is

1073
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:35,039
Shepard Smith

1074
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:40,415
I don't know man this is really stupid

1075
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:43,231
Just trying to find some ways to differentiate him

1076
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:44,255
Himself from

1077
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:47,071
These places that are more profit

1078
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:56,287
Lest you think that Alex is talk about revelation

1079
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:57,567
On our last episode

1080
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:00,639
Alex now gets into some religious

1081
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:01,407
Just talk

1082
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:02,943
Vet

1083
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:03,711
Poorly

1084
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:06,015
Interesting ways I would say

1085
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:08,575
Understand

1086
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:11,135
Printing traduce

1087
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:11,903
Ocean of the Buy

1088
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:15,231
Zip tie

1089
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:16,255
Just a

1090
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:19,839
You know what I mean I can't come up with a better way

1091
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:23,423
Not if you talk about King James

1092
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:26,751
Nothing is his Telltale

1093
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:28,799
Ash what the Bible says

1094
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:30,335
Not true

1095
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:34,431
A couple times

1096
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:36,735
Red

1097
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:39,807
Testament that Christ shed

1098
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:41,087
Gadgetry

1099
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:46,975
I think from the estimate in red I think from that

1100
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:48,255
He doesn't understand that

1101
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:49,535
This is where they're always in

1102
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:51,583
In most Editions

1103
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:55,167
Yeah that's what tradition of of

1104
00:52:55,423 --> 00:53:01,567
The actual when it was originally written they specifically wrote it in Red by or that this was somehow

1105
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:07,711
More important among the things Jesus said

1106
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:09,759
It really feels to me like

1107
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:10,783
You think that those are two

1108
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:11,551
Two different things

1109
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:12,831
Being in red and

1110
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:13,599
Jesus said it

1111
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:16,927
Which is not the case of every edition of the Bible

1112
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:20,767
Majority of them

1113
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:21,535
Allah Jesus

1114
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:25,119
His words are in red

1115
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:28,959
Maybe more

1116
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:31,775
Evangelical world

1117
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:34,335
Versions of the Bible

1118
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:35,359
That's

1119
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:37,663
Pretty strong

1120
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:41,503
Then let's say

1121
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:43,295
I don't know Eleuthera

1122
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:48,415
Churches that I went to grown-up our Bibles were

1123
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:50,719
Provided directly from

1124
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:53,279
Alright

1125
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:54,047
Yeah

1126
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:55,583
So

1127
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:57,119
Alex is getting into this

1128
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:58,655
Mode where he's

1129
00:53:59,167 --> 00:53:59,679
Breeding

1130
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:01,471
Which I would say

1131
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:02,751
It's not a good sign

1132
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:04,543
For a propagandist

1133
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:12,223
It really does especially after that earlier the clip where he was talking about Fox News rigging debates and all that stuff

1134
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:15,807
Whenever he was talking about the

1135
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:16,831
Success story

1136
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:20,159
This whole show and I put it up an hour to put it up

1137
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:21,695
Call to Arms and you're like no

1138
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:22,463
You just

1139
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:23,743
You just wrote of eulogy

1140
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:26,815
Your sentimental four-year-old

1141
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:28,095
Cheap Studio cuz

1142
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:29,119
You know you have to make

1143
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:30,399
Subpoenaed

1144
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:33,471
Good to hear just

1145
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:34,495
Outright

1146
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:36,031
Preaching

1147
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:38,591
Yeah

1148
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:40,383
The scripture

1149
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:41,663
Finish next play

1150
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:42,687
And then he

1151
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:46,271
So weird OK was one of the things that made me like

1152
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:51,391
Play the last episode we did about Revelation apocalypse

1153
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:52,415
Literature

1154
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:54,975
Well that's pretty normal that's just a normal

1155
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:56,255
Doomsday

1156
00:54:56,511 --> 00:54:57,535
Interpretation of

1157
00:54:57,791 --> 00:54:58,559
Religion

1158
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:01,375
I was like

1159
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:02,143
This is

1160
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:03,423
Interesting crazy

1161
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:06,751
Orange men do not

1162
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:10,335
Nor of a bramble bush

1163
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:11,871
Gather the grapes

1164
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:14,175
A good man out of

1165
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:15,455
Good treasure

1166
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:17,247
Of his heart brings forth

1167
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:18,271
That was yours

1168
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:19,551
This is the

1169
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:21,087
Versus after the verse

1170
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:21,855
About time

1171
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:23,391
You know a tree by its fruit

1172
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:24,671
And he just kept going

1173
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:31,327
That which is evil

1174
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:36,703
His mouth

1175
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:44,127
Why everywhere

1176
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:46,687
Exactly what I was watching

1177
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:48,991
Why do they lost after creating crime

1178
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:54,111
Why do they lost after attacking question

1179
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:57,439
Because it's the abundance of their heart

1180
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:59,231
Spiritual

1181
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:01,535
It is an operating system

1182
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:09,215
Call it a spell

1183
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:11,263
What

1184
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:13,055
Country

1185
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:14,079
Go under

1186
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:15,871
Mass psychosis

1187
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:18,943
Pushing the psychosis

1188
00:56:26,879 --> 00:56:30,463
They degrade to the very lowest common denominator

1189
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:32,255
Pyramids

1190
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:40,447
What

1191
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:41,215
Wavelength

1192
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:42,751
Whatever you want to say

1193
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:44,287
Every culture

1194
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:51,967
Eating babies for every culture

1195
00:56:57,087 --> 00:57:00,415
So I was so fascinated by that cuz I like

1196
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:01,695
Weird

1197
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:03,999
Figure out what this light.

1198
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:05,791
Good stuff

1199
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:14,751
Literally a site in Egypt called The Black Pyramid

1200
00:57:15,007 --> 00:57:17,823
Is created by Eminem hot

1201
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:29,087
I just got into my head with Eminem lyrics Eminem

1202
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:34,975
I didn't go all that well

1203
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:35,743
Another pyramid

1204
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:39,327
That pyramid was built during the 12th Dynasty

1205
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:40,351
In Egypt

1206
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:41,631
After which point

1207
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:42,399
Civilization

1208
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:43,935
For a very long time

1209
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:46,239
Also the Black Pyramid was never fully

1210
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:47,263
Construct

1211
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:48,543
Didn't happen at the end

1212
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:49,823
Decline of that Civilization

1213
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:54,175
Also according to Scholars the practice of human sacrifice outside of the possible

1214
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:55,711
Instances of killing prisoners of

1215
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:57,247
The war in the ritualize version

1216
00:57:57,759 --> 00:57:58,783
Capital punishment

1217
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:01,087
Send it around the beginning of the second

1218
00:58:01,343 --> 00:58:02,879
Steve Farber up for the time of

1219
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:04,159
Eminem hot the Third

1220
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:08,255
Believe that the practice was far more prevalent

1221
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:10,047
Actually was

1222
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:16,447
It's really easy to convince people that

1223
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:17,215
Easy like it

1224
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:17,983
Really

1225
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:21,311
Predisposed somehow

1226
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:23,871
3 pyramid

1227
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:29,503
Conspiracy theories about a secret Black Pyramid that was once there and no one wants you to know about

1228
00:58:30,271 --> 00:58:34,111
In 1737 Explorer Frederick Lewis Norton

1229
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:34,879
Visited

1230
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:36,927
Egypt

1231
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:37,951
Called travels

1232
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:39,231
Egypt and Nubia

1233
00:58:39,487 --> 00:58:40,255
Published in 7th

1234
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:41,791
1555

1235
00:58:44,351 --> 00:58:50,239
Conspiracy theorist of pieces of attacks to argue that there's a fourth pyramid that should be

1236
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:51,007
Is not

1237
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:54,591
And it was made of a black granite material unlike the other

1238
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:55,359
3 pyramid

1239
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:56,127
Is there

1240
00:58:56,383 --> 00:58:58,687
Is that was true

1241
00:58:58,943 --> 00:59:01,247
Of course not it's just a result of a mistranslation

1242
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:03,551
From the original French Norton.

1243
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:05,855
Describe the fourth pyramid As You Are

1244
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:07,903
Which is to say more black or darker

1245
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:08,927
Other places

1246
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:10,463
Send a text to specified

1247
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:11,743
They're made out of black

1248
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:13,279
Not it is

1249
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:14,559
He's clearly speak

1250
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:15,583
Of this

1251
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:17,631
Parative level of Blackness

1252
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:21,471
Also scholars believe that he mistook

1253
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:23,519
Satellite pyramid of one of the other three

1254
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:25,567
Pyramids for being a great pyramid in another

1255
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:26,335
Itself

1256
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:27,871
So this Black Pyramid doesn't

1257
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:28,895
I could ever exist

1258
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:31,967
I don't want to put too fine a point on this

1259
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:36,831
Other than these two examples I can find no evidence of any black pyramids anywhere in the world

1260
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:39,647
Not in Central America and South America

1261
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:40,415
Anywhere

1262
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:41,695
But I did run into a few

1263
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:43,743
Few possibilities of where Alex might become

1264
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:46,047
Okay I think

1265
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:48,607
Might be what he's talking about

1266
00:59:48,863 --> 00:59:50,143
I don't know if it'll be hard to say

1267
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:54,751
So this is two truths and a lie

1268
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:57,567
No I mean there's no guessing game

1269
00:59:57,823 --> 01:00:00,639
There's a book that was written by Joseph Bushnell a

1270
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:03,455
It's called Curly in the Aztec gold published

1271
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:04,479
1824

1272
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:07,039
Which features are Central American Black Pyramid

1273
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:09,855
The pyramid is a Herald that the adventurer is

1274
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:10,879
Location

1275
01:00:11,135 --> 01:00:11,903
The Treasure of the Aztec

1276
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:15,487
The problem is this was the work of fiction published invoice

1277
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:17,791
Specifically for the Boy Scout Democrat

1278
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:21,119
It was part of a series of Boy Scout Adventures

1279
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:21,887
It's a work of fiction

1280
01:00:22,143 --> 01:00:28,287
Pyramid was made up that were six Liquors The Legend of Korra I don't think so I think it's just

1281
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:30,079
Coincidence

1282
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:31,615
Okay

1283
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:32,639
Here's the joke

1284
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:35,199
Not too far back

1285
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:38,783
Chris Brown did start a clothing

1286
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:41,599
New event is called Black Pyramid

1287
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:42,623
So if

1288
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:46,719
Not outside the realm of possibility

1289
01:00:47,231 --> 01:00:48,255
Buzz Marketing for them

1290
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:52,095
There's no but I don't know what you're talkin about

1291
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:56,703
18 babies

1292
01:00:56,959 --> 01:00:59,263
Easy saying that every culture

1293
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:01,823
It falls apart

1294
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:03,103
Especially

1295
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:05,407
Pyramid building cultures

1296
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:06,431
Incur

1297
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:08,479
Egyptians

1298
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:10,271
This is absent

1299
01:01:10,527 --> 01:01:16,671
He's just making this up

1300
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:19,487
That is built of Black Pyramid has eaten

1301
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:25,887
When you eat all your babies that's what your civilization doesn't go anywhere

1302
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:29,215
We know that none of our civilization

1303
01:01:29,471 --> 01:01:30,239
The Black Pyramid

1304
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:31,007
Babies

1305
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:34,591
Hypothetical

1306
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:36,127
I don't think

1307
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:38,175
Should be pitching this way then

1308
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:40,735
I don't know I think the closest

1309
01:01:40,991 --> 01:01:41,759
If I had to guess

1310
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:42,783
The closest thing

1311
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:44,575
To explain

1312
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:45,599
About is

1313
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:48,415
Probably that Giza mistranslation

1314
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:49,951
Popular

1315
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:52,255

Now we have a burgeoning

1321
01:02:01,983 --> 01:02:02,495
Conspiracy

1322
01:02:06,847 --> 01:02:07,359

1324
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:11,199
It should give you a sense

1325
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:11,967
Of

1326
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:13,247
How little he looks

1327
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:17,343
You could just

1328
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:19,391
That

1329
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:24,511
Even start talking

1330
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:32,959
And how they because this is Victor levels of like

1331
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:36,031
Priest has a plus one

1332
01:02:36,287 --> 01:02:37,567
F****** Cana

1333
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:40,639
So he's trying to justify his declaration

1334
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:43,199
Let you know you got a little bit too far Black Pyramid

1335
01:02:43,711 --> 01:02:45,503
Course and this is how he chooses

1336
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:47,039
To support his thesis

1337
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:48,319
And it's not good

1338
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:55,487
Equation of glass

1339
01:03:00,095 --> 01:03:01,375
That's the Titanic program

1340
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:10,847
Interesting weird piece of

1341
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:14,175
Implying a suicide

1342
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:14,943
Because of what he

1343
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:21,599
They were in the first class

1344
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:28,767
Next

1345
01:03:30,047 --> 01:03:30,815
Captain offer to chance

1346
01:03:31,071 --> 01:03:32,095
Commit suicide

1347
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:33,119
Any toast

1348
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:34,911
Suicide

1349
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:36,703
Did the way that he's suggesting

1350
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:41,567
It's not even like

1351
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:44,127
Committing suicide

1352
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:45,151
It's like a

1353
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:47,455
But you get to choose

1354
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:48,223
Sia

1355
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:54,367
Gordian was only a for 21 days and after his son was killed in battle he hung himself without knowing that his time was up

1356
01:03:54,879 --> 01:03:55,647
Since their rule

1357
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:56,927
Contested as it was

1358
01:03:58,207 --> 01:04:01,023
Years old he's kind of f*** no matter what he did

1359
01:04:01,279 --> 01:04:05,887
Again it was a death sentence but you know

1360
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:07,167
Yeah

1361
01:04:08,447 --> 01:04:13,311
That's not

1362
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:16,639
His top General iberogast

1363
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:20,735
He was the real power in the Empire

1364
01:04:21,247 --> 01:04:23,039
He was the one who found Valentine

1365
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:25,087
You killed him or paid someone else

1366
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:31,487
When he started building that black.

1367
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:36,351
Killed himself to resolve a war he was undertaking poorly against by Tilia

1368
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:41,215
Knowing that his forces were unlikely to win

1369
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:41,983
Against this enemy

1370
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:46,591
It's far more just to Parrish one4all than many 41

1371
01:04:47,103 --> 01:04:49,919
He then went to bed woke up the next morning and stab himself in the gut

1372
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:52,223
Historians like tacitus of notice

1373
01:04:56,319 --> 01:04:57,087
Civil War

1374
01:04:57,343 --> 01:04:58,623
He was looked upon as a hero after

1375
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:02,975
Quintilius is that Joe committed suicide but it's Oracle records are on

1376
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:03,743
Unclear

1377
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:04,767
Somebody was murdered

1378
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:07,583
Suicide but the records are very great about

1379
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:09,887
And if statement about that

1380
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:13,983
Nero committed suicide after he was informed that he bent riding UPS

1381
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:17,055
Dance to death by the Empire who would ultimately

1382
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:18,079
YouTube down and bring him back

1383
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:23,199
Believe it narrow it actually committed suicide

1384
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:25,503
And that led to rumors going around

1385
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:27,039
Eventually

1386
01:05:27,295 --> 01:05:28,319
Return to wage war against

1387
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:32,671
It's a bit of an open question but there's some Scholars that believe that the prophecy

1388
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:34,719
Seasoned Revelation are largely about this

1389
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:36,511
The coming return of narrow

1390
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:41,631
Who is a well-documented oppressor of Christian

1391
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:45,215
Prominent

1392
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:47,263
Interpretation of the Book of Revelation

1393
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:49,055
Version but it's certainly not

1394
01:05:49,311 --> 01:05:49,823
Certain

1395
01:05:51,103 --> 01:05:53,407
There's some debate about

1396
01:05:54,687 --> 01:05:55,711
But there are there are some

1397
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:56,735
Pretty strong indication

1398
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:59,807
Is that a lot of the idea of the return

1399
01:06:00,063 --> 01:06:00,575
AR

1400
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:01,855
In reference

1401
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:03,135
DeNiro in the idea

1402
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:11,583
Everybody of note kind of went along with that

1403
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:13,887
Another very popular part of the interpretation

1404
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:14,655
Choose that

1405
01:06:14,911 --> 01:06:16,447
Nero

1406
01:06:16,703 --> 01:06:17,215
Suicide

1407
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:19,263
But the people claiming to be Nero with

1408
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:20,287
Come back and try and use

1409
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:23,103
Starpower

1410
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:25,663
To pretend that they were near us

1411
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:30,015
They they did not go from zero to Nero

1412
01:06:30,271 --> 01:06:30,783
No

1413
01:06:31,551 --> 01:06:37,695
I told you trying to do that was not good

1414
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:41,535
Jordan jokes

1415
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:47,423
Julie Rose

1416
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:48,959
I apologize

1417
01:06:49,215 --> 01:06:53,567
So anyway the point here is that no Roman emperors committed suicide in the manner that Alex's

1418
01:06:53,823 --> 01:06:54,335
Describing

1419
01:06:54,591 --> 01:06:56,639
Might have been murdered two killed

1420
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:58,431
Themselves to avoid certain Capital Pawn

1421
01:06:58,687 --> 01:07:01,503
Punishment one killed himself knowing that he was a Sitting Duck

1422
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:05,087
Alex is full of s***

1423
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:07,903
None of this justifies his argument that they killed themselves

1424
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:08,671
Babies

1425
01:07:09,183 --> 01:07:10,463
Class blah blah blah black.

1426
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:11,743
This is all just

1427
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:13,535
Anybody who listens to

1428
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:15,327
Pathetic

1429
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:16,351
Think that anybody

1430
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:17,375
Might

1431
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:18,399
Knows what he saw

1432
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:20,447
Yeah I know that was crazy

1433
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:22,495
That was absolutely just

1434
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:25,055
Pulled from thin air fun

1435
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:29,919
I realize it would I kind of

1436
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:31,967
Resonate within the present day

1437
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:34,015
What makes it so difficult is a lot of

1438
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:36,063
The stuff is really dangerous rhetoric

1439
01:07:37,343 --> 01:07:37,855
People getting hurt

1440
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:40,415
Stuff your stocking

1441
01:07:40,671 --> 01:07:41,183
Fuckingawesome

1442
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:45,023
Enjoy how wrong he

1443
01:07:45,279 --> 01:07:45,791
He is about stuff

1444
01:07:46,047 --> 01:07:47,327
Because it allows us to be

1445
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:48,095
Education

1446
01:07:48,351 --> 01:07:51,167
Am Joy Bryant

1447
01:07:51,423 --> 01:07:53,215
To learn a little bit

1448
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:54,751
Explore these things

1449
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:56,799
And talk about what the truth

1450
01:07:57,055 --> 01:08:03,199
Wickaboag sure that you didn't know all of the Roman emperors who committed suicide

1451
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:06,271
The show that I really enjoy

1452
01:08:06,527 --> 01:08:07,295
And that's why

1453
01:08:07,807 --> 01:08:08,319
Is more fun

1454
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:09,343
Christmas pics

1455
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:10,879
Fart

1456
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:12,159
Awful about

1457
01:08:12,415 --> 01:08:13,695
Knowing that people are going to get hurt

1458
01:08:13,951 --> 01:08:18,047
Because of what he offers the opportunities to learn

1459
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:22,399
When we are in the Pres

1460
01:08:24,959 --> 01:08:25,727
Because of the

1461
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:28,031
Contacts

1462
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:30,079
Where is

1463
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:33,663
This stuff yeah yeah yeah course coming tomorrow

1464
01:08:33,919 --> 01:08:38,527
Where is if we look at 2013 we do know what happened the next day

1465
01:08:38,783 --> 01:08:39,295
Like that

1466
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:41,599
Because he said stuff like this

1467
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:44,927
Is just awful

1468
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:47,231
And they're going to take

1469
01:08:47,487 --> 01:08:49,791
They're going to get you

1470
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:51,839
She realized

1471
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:53,887
AR

1472
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:56,959
And what they are

1473
01:08:57,471 --> 01:08:57,983
Book

1474
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:15,135
You're a God

1475
01:09:17,183 --> 01:09:20,255
Because they are gone there

1476
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:22,559
Is your children

1477
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:31,775
Before we go to watch face

1478
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:50,719
So I mean like what you have there is just like all of your enemies the last

1479
01:09:50,975 --> 01:09:51,743
The globalist

1480
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:52,511
See

1481
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:53,279
Immigrants

1482
01:09:53,535 --> 01:09:54,303
The lgbtq

1483
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:57,887
Atq folk all of them are just demonic project

1484
01:09:58,143 --> 01:10:00,703
Trying to stop us from going off-planet

1485
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:03,007
Don't care about them

1486
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:04,543
Don't even

1487
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:07,615
Think about the ideas that they have all they want is you

1488
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:08,383
Your children

1489
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:09,919
So f***** up

1490
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:11,711
Yeah

1491
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:13,503
More difficult to deal with

1492
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:16,319
Opportunity

1493
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:18,111
The Roman emperors

1494
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:21,439
Are impeded by

1495
01:10:22,463 --> 01:10:22,975
Anyone

1496
01:10:23,487 --> 01:10:24,511
Because if anyone believes

1497
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:25,535
Roman emperors

1498
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:27,583
Committed suicide because they were all like

1499
01:10:29,631 --> 01:10:31,167
That's a historical

1500
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:33,727
Fiction that they're believing in

1501
01:10:35,263 --> 01:10:36,799
Inform the present day

1502
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:40,383
Like you're not going to be able to lash out at the Roman Emperor

1503
01:10:40,895 --> 01:10:42,687
Bright

1504
01:10:43,711 --> 01:10:44,735
You know where the target of this

1505
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:46,271
It's very hard

1506
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:48,831
To hear what if we all just

1507
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:50,623
Stop doing everything

1508
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:52,159
Okay

1509
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:55,743
And just really focused on making sure people like

1510
01:10:55,999 --> 01:10:56,511
Alex

1511
01:10:56,767 --> 01:10:58,559
Who are saying that what's going on

1512
01:10:58,815 --> 01:11:01,375
Is where all impeding their progress

1513
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:04,191
What are we

1514
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:06,495
Really focused on getting them off

1515
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:10,591
I feel like we would probably not be able to

1516
01:11:10,847 --> 01:11:12,383
You do that and probably

1517
01:11:12,639 --> 01:11:16,479
It would waste time that we need to focus on other things I don't know

1518
01:11:16,991 --> 01:11:19,551
Maybe get rid of them

1519
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:24,159
I think it's an interesting idea allow them their space colony

1520
01:11:28,767 --> 01:11:30,047
Islam maybe it's not

1521
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:32,095
Christianity maybe it's just guys like Al

1522
01:11:32,351 --> 01:11:33,375
Incompatible

1523
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:35,423
Deserve their own

1524
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:39,007
And that Nation should be on the bucket I don't think there's anything

1525
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:45,919
Incompatible about white

1526
01:11:46,175 --> 01:11:47,711
I think if there is something

1527
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:48,991
Incompatible

1528
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:50,271
People who believe groups

1529
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:51,807
The people are incompatible

1530
01:11:53,855 --> 01:11:54,367
It is

1531
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:57,951
Disqualifies the possibility

1532
01:11:58,463 --> 01:12:03,583
This allows the possibility of people living together

1533
01:12:04,351 --> 01:12:06,655
I don't know if you

1534
01:12:06,911 --> 01:12:09,215
To have a white nationalist

1535
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:12,287
I feel like that might come back to bite us

1536
01:12:12,543 --> 01:12:18,687
The ass though because we stole it from them

1537
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:25,087
The legends about being an exile

1538
01:12:26,623 --> 01:12:29,439
A good path to go down

1539
01:12:29,695 --> 01:12:30,207
You know

1540
01:12:30,463 --> 01:12:31,231
Feel like education

1541
01:12:32,511 --> 01:12:33,791
The best possibility

1542
01:12:34,303 --> 01:12:35,839
You probably don't have the time for it

1543
01:12:36,095 --> 01:12:39,167
That's the approach I'm going to stick with cuz I don't know if we

1544
01:12:39,423 --> 01:12:39,935
We can get them to Mars

1545
01:12:41,727 --> 01:12:44,031
Alex has a gecko

1546
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:46,591
Stu's very proud

1547
01:12:48,127 --> 01:12:51,967
Dealing with some tough times Pauly Shore

1548
01:12:52,991 --> 01:12:54,271
Impasse on the show

1549
01:12:55,807 --> 01:12:56,319
Okay.

1550
01:12:56,575 --> 01:12:57,599
The weasel okay

1551
01:12:57,855 --> 01:12:58,367
Stephen Baldwin

1552
01:12:58,879 --> 01:13:00,415
8

1553
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:02,463
It's

1554
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:04,511
I heard that he was going to be

1555
01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:05,535
Guest on the show

1556
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:08,095
Can punch on this

1557
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:09,631
I do not care at all

1558
01:13:10,143 --> 01:13:10,911
But after listen

1559
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:12,703
I realized

1560
01:13:12,959 --> 01:13:13,983
What year that we should get into

1561
01:13:16,031 --> 01:13:16,543
Here is

1562
01:13:17,055 --> 01:13:17,823
Bit of an introduction

1563
01:13:18,591 --> 01:13:24,735
Alright welcome back blazing gentlemen thank you so much for joining us on this live Tuesday May

1564
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:25,503
21st

1565
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:28,319
2019 Volvo transmission

1566
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:43,935
As a joke

1567
01:13:44,447 --> 01:13:47,263
So we had count dankula yes of course

1568
01:13:47,775 --> 01:13:48,799
Of course it's count

1569
01:13:49,311 --> 01:13:54,943
You never suspect a Angela

1570
01:13:55,199 --> 01:14:01,343
Is not going to prison

1571
01:14:01,599 --> 01:14:04,927
020 in a joke

1572
01:14:05,183 --> 01:14:07,487
I refuse to accept your credit

1573
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:14,655
Decide

1574
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:20,287
Feel like I should read it again

1575
01:14:21,823 --> 01:14:27,199
Mark meechan so he's not going to prison 800-pound fine for posting

1576
01:14:27,455 --> 01:14:29,247
The video where he trained his dog to Heil

1577
01:14:30,015 --> 01:14:32,063
He's refused to pay that fine

1578
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:34,367
Best way to appeal the verdict but I see no evidence

1579
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:39,487
Other than possibly like a holding

1580
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:42,815
Or that he's facing the possibility of jail

1581
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:45,631
Not only is he not looking at jail time

1582
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:48,447
You currently running for MP on the Q-tip ticket

1583
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:51,519
Which is probably little more high-profile of thing that he should

1584
01:14:51,775 --> 01:14:52,799
Should be trying to get involved in

1585
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:55,615
So you're saying that it was a joke

1586
01:14:56,127 --> 01:15:02,271
Got his dog to do the Heil Hitler

1587
01:15:02,527 --> 01:15:04,575
You can party

1588
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:05,599
People who've rally to his

1589
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:10,975
When you're making Chucky videos by dogs doing Hitler salute

1590
01:15:11,231 --> 01:15:13,023
People might think you're an a****** and you end up

1591
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:14,303
Concurring a small fine

1592
01:15:14,559 --> 01:15:15,839
Review run for public office

1593
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:17,631
People are going to start actually research

1594
01:15:18,399 --> 01:15:19,679
And that's bad for business

1595
01:15:27,103 --> 01:15:27,615
Discord server

1596
01:15:29,407 --> 01:15:31,455
There was a cesspool of racism and anti-semitism

1597
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:34,271
Meeting himself posted tons of races

1598
01:15:34,527 --> 01:15:36,063
Around the n-word a bunch

1599
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:37,343
But was more telling was

1600
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:38,367
The stuff is members

1601
01:15:38,623 --> 01:15:41,951
Proposed is the question.

1602
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:45,535
People were advocating

1603
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:47,583
Tacos nuking Muslims went around

1604
01:15:47,839 --> 01:15:48,351
Free

1605
01:15:48,607 --> 01:15:50,143
Sport was expressed for the audible

1606
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:52,703
Send division a Neo-Nazi group link 25 murders in

1607
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:53,471
The US

1608
01:15:53,727 --> 01:15:54,239
People post

1609
01:15:57,567 --> 01:15:59,103
The group would quote actually do something

1610
01:16:00,127 --> 01:16:00,895
The BBC notes

1611
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:02,175
Remember of Sonic

1612
01:16:02,431 --> 01:16:02,943
Pretty good reason

1613
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:05,247
Recirculating material advocating

1614
01:16:05,503 --> 01:16:06,015
Prince Harry

1615
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:07,295
For being a race traitor

1616
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:10,623
Beecham's Discord server shutdown

1617
01:16:10,879 --> 01:16:12,927
Become part of the campaign rhetoric moving forward

1618
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:18,815
I got to say that you kept is really knocking it out of the park in terms of letting s*** heads run for office and their name

1619
01:16:19,071 --> 01:16:23,935
Tommy Robinson all running under their Banner

1620
01:16:24,447 --> 01:16:27,775
This level of shitheadra may never be top

1621
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:30,847
You kind of got to feel bad for count dankula

1622
01:16:32,127 --> 01:16:34,943
Third build

1623
01:16:39,807 --> 01:16:42,623
Discord server ship barely even registers as notable

1624
01:16:42,879 --> 01:16:45,695
Yeah that's said that's who do you want to die

1625
01:16:46,207 --> 01:16:47,231
Sargon

1626
01:16:47,487 --> 01:16:48,255
No

1627
01:16:48,511 --> 01:16:54,655
I don't know what do you mean

1628
01:16:54,911 --> 01:17:01,055
Also-ran

1629
01:17:01,311 --> 01:17:01,823
Exactly

1630
01:17:02,847 --> 01:17:05,151
Do all his bigotry and all his nonsense

1631
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:07,455
Is good enough to make him a hero now with his eyes

1632
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:09,503
And so he'll be coming up here in a little bit

1633
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:10,271
On the show

1634
01:17:10,783 --> 01:17:11,551
But the interview.

1635
01:17:11,807 --> 01:17:12,575
Start immediately

1636
01:17:12,831 --> 01:17:14,111
Evolve

1637
01:17:14,367 --> 01:17:15,135
Into

1638
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:16,159
Some weird

1639
01:17:16,415 --> 01:17:16,927
Thoughts

1640
01:17:17,183 --> 01:17:22,047
Okay Ru starts talking about how what he did with his dog

1641
01:17:22,559 --> 01:17:23,071
And

1642
01:17:24,095 --> 01:17:24,607
And

1643
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:27,167
They would have

1644
01:17:28,447 --> 01:17:29,215
Looney Tunes

1645
01:17:29,727 --> 01:17:30,239
Cartoon

1646
01:17:31,007 --> 01:17:31,775
Or Donald Duck

1647
01:17:33,055 --> 01:17:33,823
Do they do satirist

1648
01:17:34,079 --> 01:17:35,103
Things about the

1649
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:39,199
Alex says this nothing but I just think it's really funny

1650
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:41,503
Donald Duck

1651
01:17:43,551 --> 01:17:44,831
The hall Hitler

1652
01:17:48,671 --> 01:17:50,719
B

1653
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:53,791
You are looking

1654
01:17:54,047 --> 01:17:55,071
Like you're terrified

1655
01:17:57,631 --> 01:18:00,703
Call nine-one-one right now

1656
01:18:00,959 --> 01:18:01,727
Various

1657
01:18:01,983 --> 01:18:02,495
Terrifying

1658
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:07,359
Even if

1659
01:18:07,615 --> 01:18:12,223
Even if count dankula

1660
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:16,319
Hitler

1661
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:20,415
Bennallack starts rambling about how he had a dog that is now past

1662
01:18:20,927 --> 01:18:27,071
Suspicious

1663
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:29,887
Looks like it had a Hitler mustache because of the group

1664
01:18:30,143 --> 01:18:31,935
And he said that he got it to do a

1665
01:18:32,191 --> 01:18:32,703
Hitler salute

1666
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:34,239
I think he's really just trying to get it on

1667
01:18:34,495 --> 01:18:35,775
Marc's

1668
01:18:37,823 --> 01:18:40,127
Just a bit also being Hitler dog guy yeah

1669
01:18:40,383 --> 01:18:40,895
Yeah it's

1670
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:43,455
A little bit sad

1671
01:18:43,711 --> 01:18:45,503
To be Hitler dog got you got to give it a shot

1672
01:18:45,759 --> 01:18:46,527
Yeah it's a pretty

1673
01:18:46,783 --> 01:18:47,807
Pathetic display on Alex

1674
01:18:48,063 --> 01:18:51,903
Estes Park

1675
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:53,439
Best thing on this episode

1676
01:18:54,207 --> 01:18:57,023
Apparently his children are into watching

1677
01:18:57,279 --> 01:18:58,559
Speed running videos

1678
01:18:58,815 --> 01:19:01,887
A video games on YouTube

1679
01:19:02,143 --> 01:19:05,983
I don't mind share one

1680
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:08,031
I don't mind some of the

1681
01:19:08,287 --> 01:19:12,639
Take some long for me to watch

1682
01:19:13,151 --> 01:19:15,455
So Alex has his kids watching

1683
01:19:15,967 --> 01:19:16,735
Speed running videos

1684
01:19:17,247 --> 01:19:18,527
And I'm not sure he understands

1685
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:21,087
I watch Like A nine-hour Final Fantasy

1686
01:19:21,343 --> 01:19:22,879
99 are Final Fantasy

1687
01:19:25,183 --> 01:19:27,999
Crazies

1688
01:19:28,255 --> 01:19:34,399
May I recommend building a ship in a bottle

1689
01:19:34,655 --> 01:19:36,703
Groupon

1690
01:19:36,959 --> 01:19:39,775
Alex yells about how great astronauts

1691
01:19:40,031 --> 01:19:42,335
Were and how great

1692
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:43,103
They had

1693
01:19:43,615 --> 01:19:44,127
Being able

1694
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:45,407
Control the shuttles

1695
01:19:45,663 --> 01:19:46,175
Switch joystick

1696
01:19:46,687 --> 01:19:49,503
As sort of an analog

1697
01:19:49,759 --> 01:19:50,783
How trivial

1698
01:19:51,039 --> 01:19:52,575
The speed Runners are

1699
01:19:55,391 --> 01:19:59,743
This is so weird so he's comparing speed Runners to astronauts

1700
01:19:59,999 --> 01:20:00,511
Alright

1701
01:20:00,767 --> 01:20:02,047
I feel like that's a little unfair

1702
01:20:03,327 --> 01:20:04,095
I'll let him

1703
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:04,863
Pika pika

1704
01:20:08,447 --> 01:20:14,336
Did Nintendo joysticks that can do things that robots can't do

1705
01:20:14,848 --> 01:20:17,152
Robots can't do it

1706
01:20:18,176 --> 01:20:20,992
Sure

1707
01:20:24,832 --> 01:20:30,976
All the perfect moves to perfectly go through a game at the maximum speed

1708
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:40,960
Business

1709
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:48,640
A lot of them are married and a lot of them have made businesses out of speed running video game

1710
01:20:48,896 --> 01:20:49,664
More than Alex

1711
01:20:51,968 --> 01:20:56,320
Military

1712
01:20:57,856 --> 01:21:00,160
Sizing ocean man

1713
01:21:02,464 --> 01:21:05,024
What they do and how they spend their lives that's your life

1714
01:21:06,048 --> 01:21:08,096
Level of skill

1715
01:21:09,376 --> 01:21:10,656
Wash down the toilet

1716
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:12,704
Over video game

1717
01:21:13,472 --> 01:21:14,496
Is sad

1718
01:21:15,008 --> 01:21:16,032
Oh man

1719
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:18,080
You have preset

1720
01:21:18,336 --> 01:21:23,712
If LeBron James had funneled all of that going to war

1721
01:21:24,224 --> 01:21:28,320
Right

1722
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:31,904
Play Child

1723
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:33,952
F*** off

1724
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:37,792
Yeah that's sort of mentality could be applied pretty capriciously across-the-board

1725
01:21:38,304 --> 01:21:40,608
What I would say is I really love

1726
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:44,704
How that clip started

1727
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:48,544
Against top robots robots robots

1728
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:54,176
Who wrote the robot

1729
01:21:59,808 --> 01:22:00,576
Coordination

1730
01:22:04,416 --> 01:22:05,184
Talking about these

1731
01:22:05,952 --> 01:22:06,720
Competition

1732
01:22:06,976 --> 01:22:08,000
People are going

1733
01:22:08,512 --> 01:22:09,024
Robot

1734
01:22:09,536 --> 01:22:10,048
Quotes

1735
01:22:10,304 --> 01:22:12,352
Tool assisted speedrun

1736
01:22:12,608 --> 01:22:13,632
Yeah

1737
01:22:13,888 --> 01:22:15,936
Who is people who programmed the input

1738
01:22:18,496 --> 01:22:19,776
Controller in order to make

1739
01:22:20,288 --> 01:22:20,800
The most

1740
01:22:21,312 --> 01:22:23,360
Perfect run possible

1741
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:27,968
Trying to talk about I believe so and I heard him say

1742
01:22:28,224 --> 01:22:30,784
Lego robot

1743
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:33,088
I really think that's what he said

1744
01:22:33,344 --> 01:22:35,392
Is really about to assisted speedrun

1745
01:22:35,648 --> 01:22:40,256
And people racing that are sometimes able to

1746
01:22:40,512 --> 01:22:41,792
To beat these two little sister

1747
01:22:42,048 --> 01:22:42,560
Speedrun

1748
01:22:42,816 --> 01:22:45,632
Which is the most perfect way to go through it

1749
01:22:46,144 --> 01:22:51,776
Is because sometimes shortcuts are found

1750
01:22:52,032 --> 01:22:55,872
And it takes a long time to program a tool assisted speedrun

1751
01:22:56,128 --> 01:23:00,992
Sulfate before someone would be able to reprogram the computer run

1752
01:23:01,248 --> 01:23:01,760
Through the game

1753
01:23:02,016 --> 01:23:03,552
Someone could have discovered a glitch

1754
01:23:03,808 --> 01:23:04,576
To be able to do it

1755
01:23:05,088 --> 01:23:08,416
Situations where people are talking about

1756
01:23:08,672 --> 01:23:09,440
Frame perfect

1757
01:23:10,976 --> 01:23:11,488
Nearest

1758
01:23:14,304 --> 01:23:17,888
If you could program the 12 glitches

1759
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:20,960
A human will not be able to do better than a robot

1760
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:23,008
Because

1761
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:27,872
It takes too long to program

1762
01:23:28,128 --> 01:23:28,896
Can do faster than robot

1763
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:30,432
Anyway

1764
01:23:30,688 --> 01:23:35,296
Whatever else to talk about is if you watch a video with his kids don't understand what's going on

1765
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:36,576
Which is kind of funny

1766
01:23:37,856 --> 01:23:39,904
It also said that he doesn't understand

1767
01:23:40,672 --> 01:23:43,744
AP understood how huge Market that is

1768
01:23:44,256 --> 01:23:46,816
Could tap into

1769
01:23:47,072 --> 01:23:47,584
Gamers

1770
01:23:48,096 --> 01:23:52,192
No they were making what was it there was just a recent report that it was

1771
01:23:52,448 --> 01:23:52,960
Looks like they're making

1772
01:23:53,216 --> 01:23:54,240
$30,000 in

1773
01:23:54,496 --> 01:23:55,264
An hour for

1774
01:23:56,288 --> 01:23:58,848
Twitch stream

1775
01:23:59,104 --> 01:23:59,872
Robot

1776
01:24:00,896 --> 01:24:01,408
Top robot

1777
01:24:04,992 --> 01:24:05,504
I'm not talking s***

1778
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:06,528
Gamers

1779
01:24:13,184 --> 01:24:14,720
Turns it around a little bit

1780
01:24:20,096 --> 01:24:23,424

Ultra reality

1784
01:24:30,592 --> 01:24:35,968
Someone else to control your life to make sure you never amount to anything

1785
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:41,344
What's a snare

1786
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:45,952
Human world that is now

1787
01:24:46,208 --> 01:24:46,720

Apocalyptica

1792
01:25:07,456 --> 01:25:12,064
Go f*** yourself and then buy my products while I mean it's a little bit apocalyptic

1793
01:25:14,624 --> 01:25:20,768

We will

1797
01:25:31,008 --> 01:25:33,312
Gamer

1798
01:25:33,568 --> 01:25:34,336
I bet

1799
01:25:34,592 --> 01:25:36,128
Get the 8-pack double stack

1800
01:25:38,688 --> 01:25:42,016
Replace the Ruby Red Mountain Dew with the Apex

1801
01:25:45,088 --> 01:25:47,136
Code Red Mountain Dew

1802
01:25:47,904 --> 01:25:48,416
Everyone wins

1803
01:25:48,928 --> 01:25:51,744
Killer interview

1804
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,304
Thank you I'm sorry I forgot his honorific title

1805
01:25:57,376 --> 01:25:59,424
Desperate to let everyone know that he did Hitler dog

1806
01:26:06,592 --> 01:26:12,736
On top of that

1807
01:26:12,992 --> 01:26:19,136
Hitler mustache

1808
01:26:19,392 --> 01:26:25,536
Looking for someone to pay attention to you and anyway

1809
01:26:25,792 --> 01:26:29,888
This has raised a ton of money for his own like free-speech grip that he's on and I was running

1810
01:26:30,144 --> 01:26:31,936
A f****** MP in the UK

1811
01:26:32,192 --> 01:26:33,472
He's gone from

1812
01:26:33,984 --> 01:26:35,264
Nobody to

1813
01:26:35,776 --> 01:26:38,080
Someone who I would have on my show

1814
01:26:38,592 --> 01:26:41,920
Just because he didn't Hitler dog thing I have to anybody

1815
01:26:43,456 --> 01:26:43,968
No one cares

1816
01:26:46,016 --> 01:26:47,808
Text clip

1817
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:49,344
Is making the argument

1818
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:51,904
That are dead the last

1819
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:52,928
Obviously

1820
01:26:53,952 --> 01:26:56,256
And his argument is that it went

1821
01:26:56,512 --> 01:26:57,024
From milkshake

1822
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:57,792
To Brick

1823
01:26:58,048 --> 01:26:59,072
In a matter of days

1824
01:26:59,328 --> 01:27:02,144
He fails to recognize is that they're too

1825
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:02,912
Group

1826
01:27:05,216 --> 01:27:06,752
Rocks at Tommy Robinson

1827
01:27:07,008 --> 01:27:09,056
Are not the same people who are milkshaking

1828
01:27:09,312 --> 01:27:10,080
People now

1829
01:27:10,336 --> 01:27:12,896
Not like that's a one-to-one escalation

1830
01:27:13,408 --> 01:27:14,432
So that's a problem

1831
01:27:14,944 --> 01:27:15,712
I meant seconds

1832
01:27:18,528 --> 01:27:19,040
At

1833
01:27:19,296 --> 01:27:24,416
It count dankula so you might feel better

1834
01:27:24,672 --> 01:27:28,768
I think so actually I'm not entirely sure if he's one of them

1835
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:31,072
He said that if someone threw a milkshake on him

1836
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:33,120
Share great good for you

1837
01:27:34,144 --> 01:27:34,656
Grow up

1838
01:27:35,168 --> 01:27:35,936
So he's trying

1839
01:27:36,192 --> 01:27:40,032
Make this argument that escalated so quickly and then now we're going to

1840
01:27:40,288 --> 01:27:40,800
Killed

1841
01:27:41,056 --> 01:27:44,128
He does something that I signed entirely disgraceful

1842
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:45,408
Interim

1843
01:27:46,688 --> 01:27:47,456
Justifying

1844
01:27:48,736 --> 01:27:52,064
Ketamine and enema out of days it went from milkshake tubex

1845
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:53,088
And Des

1846
01:27:53,344 --> 01:27:55,648
Ramada days and then you put people in the media.

1847
01:27:55,904 --> 01:28:00,512
Eden on I think it's that's only going to be a matter of time before someone you know

1848
01:28:00,768 --> 01:28:06,656
Not your father's Tommy Robinson you do me a solid going well we're going to get hit with a milkshake

1849
01:28:07,168 --> 01:28:10,496
We're going to be seriously assaulting someone is going to be in jail

1850
01:28:10,752 --> 01:28:12,544
Someone's going to get hotlist result

1851
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:14,080
And a day

1852
01:28:14,336 --> 01:28:14,848
People that

1853
01:28:15,104 --> 01:28:21,248
One of the main things the switch was absolutely

1854
01:28:21,504 --> 01:28:27,136
Tragic horrendous thing and obviously measures should be taken to prevent such a thing from ever happening again

1855
01:28:28,416 --> 01:28:28,928
So

1856
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:33,280
It's hard to hear what he said there cuz of that Scottish brogue but what are you saying is

1857
01:28:33,536 --> 01:28:34,816
Is that the murder of Joe Cocker

1858
01:28:37,888 --> 01:28:40,192
Logistic Lee measures

1859
01:28:40,448 --> 01:28:44,032
Have you taken to prevent a thing like a murder of Jo Cox ever happening again

1860
01:28:44,288 --> 01:28:46,080
That's something that I find really

1861
01:28:46,336 --> 01:28:46,848
F****** in

1862
01:28:48,128 --> 01:28:51,200
You don't know Joe Cox was a Labour MP who was murdered

1863
01:28:51,456 --> 01:28:52,736
Shot and stabbed multiple times

1864
01:28:52,992 --> 01:28:53,504
X back in 20

1865
01:28:54,528 --> 01:29:00,160
Listen to Someone Like Tommy Robinson or Alex Jones

1866
01:29:00,416 --> 01:29:01,440
Without you know they

1867
01:29:01,696 --> 01:29:02,720
Completely overrun Britain

1868
01:29:02,976 --> 01:29:04,512
Heroes like Tommy are the only ones with

1869
01:29:06,048 --> 01:29:06,560
That wasn't the case

1870
01:29:07,328 --> 01:29:09,120
52 year olds

1871
01:29:09,376 --> 01:29:11,936
Scottish thomas-alexandre mayor was the culprit

1872
01:29:12,192 --> 01:29:13,728
A little bit

1873
01:29:13,984 --> 01:29:15,776
Interesting to reflect on

1874
01:29:16,032 --> 01:29:19,872
The measures might be put in place that could help avoid something like that ever happen again

1875
01:29:21,408 --> 01:29:24,224
There was a big fan of one of the UK's big right-wing Terror

1876
01:29:24,736 --> 01:29:25,248
David Coppola

1877
01:29:26,016 --> 01:29:26,784
Coupled with a

1878
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:27,808
Devotee of

1879
01:29:28,064 --> 01:29:28,576
Franklin Pierce

1880
01:29:28,832 --> 01:29:29,856
The author of the Turner Diaries

1881
01:29:30,368 --> 01:29:31,904
Any planted three nail bomb

1882
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:33,184
Comes back in 1999

1883
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:34,464
Specifically targeting

1884
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,280
And a gay Pub

1885
01:29:37,536 --> 01:29:38,048
Respectively

1886
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:40,608
Copeland was associated with the National Alliance

1887
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:41,888
SanSai was Thomas

1888
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:45,472
As they were both subscribers of their publication which almost

1889
01:29:45,728 --> 01:29:46,496
Glee It's called free

1890
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:49,056
If there's one thing that is so clear from

1891
01:29:49,312 --> 01:29:51,616
History and so forgotten and not talked about enough

1892
01:29:51,872 --> 01:29:52,384
It's

1893
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:55,968
Has long been a central piece of the Neo-Nazi strategy

1894
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:57,248
Seeing what we now see

1895
01:29:57,504 --> 01:29:58,784

I still have faith

1904
01:30:12,608 --> 01:30:14,400
The white race will prevail

You see

01:30:20,544 --> 01:30:22,592
Tomas Maier with a dyed-in-the-wool white supremacy

No National

People of other races

1912
01:30:26,176 --> 01:30:28,224
His primary focus was on collaborators

1913
01:30:28,736 --> 01:30:29,504
From his letter

1914
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:32,576
In my opinion the greatest enemy of the old apartheid

1915
01:30:32,832 --> 01:30:33,600
System was not the AMC

1916
01:30:33,856 --> 01:30:34,880
See you in the black masses

1917
01:30:35,136 --> 01:30:36,160
But the white liberals and

1918
01:30:36,416 --> 01:30:36,928

1919
01:30:37,696 --> 01:30:38,208

Contemporary politics

Reflected Pookie salt with a traitor

1924

Before the attack

1926
01:30:49,472 --> 01:30:51,520

He felt an urgency apparel

1930
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:02,016
Carry out his attack because he was confused

1931
01:31:02,272 --> 01:31:02,784
The white race

1932
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:03,808
Spacing exercise

01:31:16,608 --> 01:31:17,120
How much of an introvert

1939

We join up with group

1940
01:31:21,984 --> 01:31:22,496
I don't understand

1941
01:31:22,752 --> 01:31:26,080
In the days leading up to the murder of Jo Cox

1942
01:31:26,336 --> 01:31:27,616
Party were running camp

1943
01:31:28,128 --> 01:31:29,152
Specifically designed around

1944
01:31:30,432 --> 01:31:33,504
The immigrants were an invading horde that we're going to destroy the country

1945
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:34,272
And leaving the

1946
01:31:34,528 --> 01:31:35,552
EU was the solution

1947
01:31:35,808 --> 01:31:36,320
Into that problem

1948
01:31:37,088 --> 01:31:38,880
Jo Cox was chosen as a Target

1949
01:31:39,136 --> 01:31:39,648
Because she was

1950
01:31:39,904 --> 01:31:40,928
Strongly anti brexit

1951
01:31:43,232 --> 01:31:44,256
But she was a traitor to the White

1952
01:31:45,024 --> 01:31:45,536
Because of that

1953
01:31:46,304 --> 01:31:47,328
All this is to say

1954
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:49,376
Did the person who killed Joe Cocker

1955
01:31:49,632 --> 01:31:50,400
Believe all the same

1956
01:31:50,656 --> 01:31:52,448
Things that the people count dankula

1957
01:31:52,704 --> 01:31:53,216
What's up with you

1958
01:31:53,984 --> 01:31:57,056
He was motivated to action in some part by the rhetoric put out by you

1959
01:31:57,568 --> 01:31:58,336
The f****** party 2

1960
01:31:58,592 --> 01:31:59,872
Count dankula is running for office

1961
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:03,200
All of the rhetoric put out by the guy who's interviewing

1962
01:32:03,456 --> 01:32:06,528
Is indistinguishable from the writings of Thomas

1963
01:32:07,552 --> 01:32:08,320
For this dumb dumb

1964
01:32:08,576 --> 01:32:09,856
Get on f****** are

1965
01:32:11,904 --> 01:32:12,672
The s*** about Joe Cocker

1966
01:32:12,928 --> 01:32:13,952
His murder is repug

1967
01:32:14,464 --> 01:32:17,280
If you would take a look in the mirror and realize that the

1968
01:32:17,792 --> 01:32:19,584
And profits from

1969
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:21,888
Is the same one that mayor came out of

1970
01:32:22,656 --> 01:32:23,424
And here's the thing

1971
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:24,192
I know

1972
01:32:24,448 --> 01:32:29,056
You can't blame the person who puts out the hateful rhetoric for the actions of the people who believe the exact

1973
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:32,640
Bootcamp

Or not

1977
01:32:43,648 --> 01:32:44,672
Hi judge of the Queens

1978
01:32:44,928 --> 01:32:45,440
Court Nigel

1979
01:32:49,024 --> 01:32:50,304
To say

1980
01:32:50,816 --> 01:32:51,328
To carry out a terror

1981
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:52,608
Inspired

1982
01:32:52,864 --> 01:32:53,888
Thomas Mair

1983
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:54,912
To begin with

1984
01:32:55,936 --> 01:32:56,448
Just

1985
01:32:56,704 --> 01:32:59,008
The thought as a joke

1986
01:32:59,264 --> 01:33:00,544
But he couldn't get it out of his head

1987
01:33:01,056 --> 01:33:02,336
The thought became stronger

1988
01:33:02,592 --> 01:33:04,896
He woke up one day and decided he was going to do

1989
01:33:08,736 --> 01:33:10,528
Has been an inspirational Force

1990
01:33:11,552 --> 01:33:12,576
Winter risen in the UK

1991
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:13,856
Started out with jokes

1992
01:33:14,624 --> 01:33:15,392
Jokes

1993
01:33:17,952 --> 01:33:18,464
Make jokes

1994
01:33:22,816 --> 01:33:23,584
I mean

1995
01:33:24,096 --> 01:33:25,632
Sing it started out as a joke

1996
01:33:27,936 --> 01:33:28,960
Expose reductive

1997
01:33:29,216 --> 01:33:31,776
I don't want

1998
01:33:32,032 --> 01:33:32,800
Characterized

1999
01:33:33,824 --> 01:33:34,592
By that

2000
01:33:34,848 --> 01:33:36,640
Or even by himself but I don't

2001
01:33:36,896 --> 01:33:37,408
Trust that

2002
01:33:38,432 --> 01:33:40,480
There there was a little malice

2003
01:33:42,272 --> 01:33:43,552
In there from the beginning

2004
01:33:43,808 --> 01:33:44,832
It wasn't it wasn't it

2005
01:33:45,088 --> 01:33:46,368
Joke

2006
01:33:46,624 --> 01:33:47,136
Define is a joke

2007
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:49,952
Annette

2008
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:54,048
That's between those shall not be together

2009
01:33:55,072 --> 01:33:58,912
I think the most important thing though is that

2010
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:01,472
Hey there they're completely wrong

2011
01:34:01,728 --> 01:34:02,240
There

2012
01:34:02,496 --> 01:34:03,008
Sweetly wrong

2013
01:34:03,264 --> 01:34:04,800
The escalation is

2014
01:34:05,056 --> 01:34:05,824
Never going to

2015
01:34:06,592 --> 01:34:07,360
From milkshakes

2016
01:34:08,384 --> 01:34:10,432
Because bricks are far less

2017
01:34:10,688 --> 01:34:11,712
Effective than milkshake

2018
01:34:12,224 --> 01:34:15,552
When fighting against these guys look

2019
01:34:15,808 --> 01:34:19,904
Silly is infinitely more effective than hurting the milkshake will escalate

2020
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:21,696
The bricks being thrown at people with milk

2021
01:34:23,488 --> 01:34:24,768
Because what

2022
01:34:25,024 --> 01:34:26,816
What is more effective at

2023
01:34:27,072 --> 01:34:30,400
Declawing a guy like Nigel farage than a headline reading

2024
01:34:30,656 --> 01:34:33,728
Nigel farage in bus hiding from milkshake

2025
01:34:33,984 --> 01:34:35,776
Absolutely

2026
01:34:36,032 --> 01:34:36,800
Giant p****

2027
01:34:37,056 --> 01:34:39,360
Thrown at him and all of a sudden

2028
01:34:39,616 --> 01:34:43,200
Smarter you are throwing milkshake

2029
01:34:43,456 --> 01:34:43,968
Understand

2030
01:34:45,248 --> 01:34:46,272
Jordan

2031
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:48,832
Count dankula and everything

2032
01:34:49,344 --> 01:34:55,488
Dance for this pitiful free-speech Griff that he's on his bad enough but to descend

2033
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:56,512
Was just f******

2034
01:34:56,768 --> 01:34:57,280
Sympathetic

2035
01:34:57,536 --> 01:35:02,400
You think measures should be taken to make sure that things like

2036
01:35:02,656 --> 01:35:05,216
Yeah we should Outlaw far-right party

2037
01:35:11,616 --> 01:35:16,224
Did you need to recognize that the ecosystems that create Foster and nurture people like

2038
01:35:16,736 --> 01:35:17,504
You need to recognize

2039
01:35:18,272 --> 01:35:23,648
You need to recognize the intentionally manipulative media strategies that I'm tagging Aizen played to the same

2040
01:35:23,904 --> 01:35:24,416
Paranoid race

2041
01:35:24,672 --> 01:35:25,952
That led him to murder

2042
01:35:26,208 --> 01:35:27,232
You need to recognize

2043
01:35:27,488 --> 01:35:28,512
The political figures that are

2044
01:35:28,768 --> 01:35:29,792
Spoiled nativist and races

2045
01:35:30,048 --> 01:35:31,328
Spears in order to make a name for them

2046
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:32,864
Make money

2047
01:35:33,376 --> 01:35:34,400
Then when you're done with that

2048
01:35:34,656 --> 01:35:39,776
Recognize that you're immediately and intimately involved with all of that s*** you're on the wrong side of it

2049
01:35:40,288 --> 01:35:41,312
And the only measure thneed

2050
01:35:41,568 --> 01:35:43,104
Harford County

2051
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:45,664
Goddamn 800-pound fine

2052
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:46,688
Shut the fuk up

2053
01:35:46,944 --> 01:35:47,456
And tell his friends

2054
01:35:47,712 --> 01:35:48,224
To do the same

2055
01:35:50,272 --> 01:35:51,552
Will go a long way

2056
01:35:52,064 --> 01:35:52,832
Towards

2057
01:35:53,088 --> 01:35:54,112
For topping make sure

2058
01:35:54,368 --> 01:35:55,904
Smashers

2059

To say to him if you want if you want

Contacts

2066
01:36:18,944 --> 01:36:20,480
Some immigrant being

2067
01:36:21,504 --> 01:36:23,808
Whatever whatever Boogeyman they want

2068
01:36:24,064 --> 01:36:26,368
And say what measures would you take

2069
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:33,024
To stop this from happening today feel

2070
01:36:35,072 --> 01:36:36,352
How do we stop this

2071
01:36:36,608 --> 01:36:37,632
Well I mean

Committing acts of Terror

2075
01:36:42,496 --> 01:36:43,008
Okay

2076
01:36:43,264 --> 01:36:43,776
Done

01:36:45,056 --> 01:36:51,200
It's f****** stupid their measures against terrorism

2078
01:36:51,712 --> 01:36:54,016
Does Keith even advocating that

2079

F****** whiteness

He's not

2081
01:37:02,464 --> 01:37:04,000
Paying lip service to like

2082
01:37:04,256 --> 01:37:07,072
Measures should be taken to make sure

2083
01:37:07,328 --> 01:37:09,376
Is on the left dark killed but like

2084
01:37:09,632 --> 01:37:10,144
YouTube

2085
01:37:13,216 --> 01:37:13,984
Okay so you like

2086
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:19,616
The only measures that would be actually helpful here are exactly the things that are counter to your stupid

2087
01:37:19,872 --> 01:37:22,944
Free-speech grip everything about your existence

2088
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:25,760
And what you stand for in the only reason

2089
01:37:27,552 --> 01:37:28,576
Counter

2090
01:37:28,832 --> 01:37:29,344
2N

2091
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:30,368
Fighting against

2092
01:37:30,624 --> 01:37:31,392
The idea of

2093
01:37:31,648 --> 01:37:33,952
Creating those measures

2094
01:37:34,208 --> 01:37:34,976
They could protect

2095
01:37:35,232 --> 01:37:36,512
Sogo

2096
01:37:36,768 --> 01:37:37,536
Fuckyourself you

2097
01:37:37,792 --> 01:37:38,304
Stupid

2098
01:37:39,328 --> 01:37:39,840
Scottish

2099
01:37:40,352 --> 01:37:42,400

Yeah kind of Joya

2101
01:37:44,192 --> 01:37:45,984
That's good

2102
01:37:50,848 --> 01:37:52,384
Scottish Twitter and you will have a

2103
01:37:52,896 --> 01:37:55,200
With

2104
01:37:55,456 --> 01:37:55,968
Accents

2105
01:38:00,064 --> 01:38:02,368
Avis Mexico

2106
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:03,392
The context

2107
01:38:03,648 --> 01:38:04,160
That you knew that

2108
01:38:04,416 --> 01:38:04,928
He's talking about

2109
01:38:05,184 --> 01:38:05,696
The left

2110
01:38:06,208 --> 01:38:06,976
You might think

2111
01:38:09,536 --> 01:38:10,048
Accuses Ally

2112
01:38:11,072 --> 01:38:12,096
Perfectly describe Ali

2113
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:15,680
If you if you defend yourself against these attacks you

2114
01:38:15,936 --> 01:38:21,312
Sasha's races not save Safeway excetera

2115
01:38:21,568 --> 01:38:26,176
If anyone comes out me with a milkshake you know I woke them up and down the street

2116
01:38:26,688 --> 01:38:32,832
If someone told me I will defend myself and I've always had an example to make sure that nobody has to do it again

2117
01:38:39,488 --> 01:38:41,024
Said that I will defend myself

2118
01:38:41,536 --> 01:38:44,096
But people use the violin one boil

2119
01:38:44,352 --> 01:38:46,656
I'm not the one that's going out trying to insult people

2120
01:38:46,912 --> 01:38:50,752
I say to defend myself you're saying you're so people usually instigate

2121
01:38:51,008 --> 01:38:54,592
We always try and even though you just said there's okay

2122
01:38:56,896 --> 01:39:01,504
Bestow try and paying you as the bad guy even though they all the people instigating that there

2123
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:06,112
They have an absolute complete lack of self-awareness boeglin that Decon

2124
01:39:06,368 --> 01:39:09,696
They kind of feed themselves for what baby Lianna

2125
01:39:09,952 --> 01:39:15,072
Wow you really want to experience

2126
01:39:15,328 --> 01:39:17,888
Envoy

2127
01:39:18,144 --> 01:39:21,728
Begin with an O my God

2128
01:39:22,496 --> 01:39:25,312
It looks like to me you know what they wanted

2129
01:39:25,568 --> 01:39:27,360
Dehumanized to the to the point

2130
01:39:27,616 --> 01:39:30,944
My God

2131
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:36,832
Free because they made themselves convinced that you know

2132
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:45,024
Demonizing immigrants Muslim lgbtq

2133
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:48,096
Is he actually Banksy

2134
01:39:48,352 --> 01:39:50,144
Are we sure he's up

2135
01:39:50,656 --> 01:39:52,448
Performance art scam of like

2136
01:39:52,704 --> 01:39:58,848
Here's how I'm going to tear that everybody else

2137
01:39:59,104 --> 01:39:59,616
Do it

2138
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:01,408
I'm going to say

2139
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:07,296
No probably not

2140
01:40:07,552 --> 01:40:09,856
Because these are easy

2141
01:40:10,112 --> 01:40:12,672
Waze

2142
01:40:14,976 --> 01:40:17,024
You're going Keyser Soze on it

2143
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:23,424
Because I can't believe otherwise

2144
01:40:24,448 --> 01:40:26,496
If it if there's no master plan behind this

2145
01:40:26,752 --> 01:40:27,264
Stan Houston

2146
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:29,824
As dumb as some somebody we might elect Brett

2147
01:40:34,944 --> 01:40:35,456
Yeah I agree

2148
01:40:35,968 --> 01:40:37,248
Square Pizza

2149
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:38,784
It's important to remember here

2150
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:40,576
That

2151
01:40:40,832 --> 01:40:41,856
Made a meal out of

2152
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:43,904
You're not paying lip service

2153
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:44,672
Stupid ideas

2154
01:40:45,952 --> 01:40:46,976
Joe Cox's murder

2155
01:40:47,488 --> 01:40:48,512
When you look into the person

2156
01:40:48,768 --> 01:40:51,584
Who committed the murder a lot of things

2157
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:52,608
Media spheres that

2158
01:40:52,864 --> 01:40:54,144
Existed in or exactly

2159
01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:54,912
Play the same thing

2160
01:40:55,168 --> 01:40:55,680
They're being open

2161
01:40:55,936 --> 01:41:00,544
On the Discord server run by yeah

2162
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:01,824
And then if that's not bad

2163
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:04,128
Alex expresses

2164
01:41:04,896 --> 01:41:06,176
I believe the fear that led

2165
01:41:06,688 --> 01:41:07,968
Marital murder

2166
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:11,040
Next clip

2167
01:41:11,808 --> 01:41:16,416
Race-based groups

2168
01:41:16,672 --> 01:41:17,440
Read White

2169
01:41:18,464 --> 01:41:24,608
Tomorrow

2170
01:41:25,888 --> 01:41:27,680
George Soros

2171
01:41:27,936 --> 01:41:33,056
Nazi collaborator

2172
01:41:33,312 --> 01:41:33,824
Interpretation

2173
01:41:34,592 --> 01:41:40,736
Really the one with the Nazi past

2174
01:41:40,992 --> 01:41:43,808
Sure

2175
01:41:44,064 --> 01:41:46,368
Exact

2176
01:41:49,696 --> 01:41:50,208
Was it

2177
01:41:50,464 --> 01:41:50,976
Operational

2178
01:41:51,488 --> 01:41:52,512
Person acting out and killing

2179
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:55,072
So I mean anytime

2180
01:41:56,864 --> 01:41:59,680
I don't know if all

2181
01:42:00,192 --> 01:42:01,472
The last of the UK's

2182
01:42:01,984 --> 01:42:02,496
2

2183
01:42:02,752 --> 01:42:05,056
Use the memory of Joe Cox are in good time

2184
01:42:07,104 --> 01:42:09,408
I'm not as fully aware of politics

2185
01:42:10,432 --> 01:42:10,944
So I'm not going to

2186
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:12,736
To say that for what I am going to say

2187
01:42:13,248 --> 01:42:13,760
Is this

2188
01:42:14,784 --> 01:42:16,320
Absolute disgrace

2189
01:42:16,576 --> 01:42:20,416
Super care in anyway and exist on this platform

2190
01:42:20,928 --> 01:42:22,208
Is an indication that

2191
01:42:22,464 --> 01:42:24,256
You don't care where you don't know

2192
01:42:24,512 --> 01:42:26,560
And or your f****** with milk

2193
01:42:27,584 --> 01:42:29,888
So Alex Jones

2194
01:42:31,424 --> 01:42:33,216
Text Cliff he comes in

2195
01:42:33,472 --> 01:42:33,984
From break

2196
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:34,752
With mother

2197
01:42:35,264 --> 01:42:37,312
As as a feather boy left

2198
01:42:37,824 --> 01:42:42,432
No he still there he's still there so Alex is just singing while the Scottish dude is on the

2199
01:42:42,944 --> 01:42:43,456
Okay

2200
01:42:56,768 --> 01:43:02,912
Alexandrite jewelry running

2201
01:43:22,368 --> 01:43:25,184
Count dankula

2202
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:31,584
Jorge comedian

2203
01:43:34,656 --> 01:43:40,544
Years in the trenches doing open-mic some shows every night off of multiple night

2204
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:46,944
I always get a little suspicious when I hear someone aggressively give themselves the title comedian or successful comedian and I can slide litter

2205
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:47,712
Really no evidence

2206
01:43:47,968 --> 01:43:48,736
I'm doing comedy

2207
01:43:55,648 --> 01:44:01,536
Reminders work if you can confess all comedians

2208
01:44:01,792 --> 01:44:03,328
I came up empty on my

2209
01:44:04,096 --> 01:44:09,984
Search result that I could find was just a story about his Nazi dog video that credited him as a comedian

2210
01:44:10,240 --> 01:44:11,776
No real evidence

2211
01:44:13,056 --> 01:44:17,152
I came across a piece Byrider Mick cloherty

2212
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:20,224
Comedians

2213
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:22,272
Scotland

2214
01:44:22,784 --> 01:44:23,808
It turns out

2215
01:44:24,064 --> 01:44:24,832
Much of him

2216
01:44:25,088 --> 01:44:26,624
Here are some quotes from the article

2217
01:44:27,904 --> 01:44:31,744
For me personally the most offensive thing about the whole debacle is that the news media freak

2218
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,048
Currently refer to Mark meechan throughout as a comedian

2219
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:36,608
Muchin is lower-tier of lager

2220
01:44:37,120 --> 01:44:40,704
He has to stand up comedy what Rebecca Black is two hard-working band

2221
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:41,728
Who played around

2222
01:44:42,496 --> 01:44:44,032
Material

2223
01:44:44,288 --> 01:44:50,432
Cereal with innuendo irony and real satire is quite frankly not the same

2224
01:44:50,688 --> 01:44:54,784
An improvised racial diatribe and Dorito crumbs Vape cloud

2225
01:44:55,040 --> 01:45:01,184
From your stupid mutton-chop face I told you this guy's have great insults

2226
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:03,488
Robert Brown

2227
01:45:03,744 --> 01:45:04,256
Anyone

2228
01:45:04,512 --> 01:45:05,536
Can call themselves a comedian

2229
01:45:05,792 --> 01:45:06,304
He's not a peer

2230
01:45:06,816 --> 01:45:12,704
YouTube is created in the Democratic comedians who assumed you're not laughing because you're offended

2231
01:45:13,472 --> 01:45:19,616
Pull it back just a little bit dude I'm with you but pull it back a little bit we're getting a little close to Nick depalo here calm it down

2232
01:45:19,872 --> 01:45:21,152
Another comedian said quote

2233
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:23,712
You my dog

2234
01:45:23,968 --> 01:45:27,552
You were saying that as a critique on people who think they're

2235
01:45:27,808 --> 01:45:29,344
Another comedian said quote

2236
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:31,904
Comedians feel scared about this and I would ask

2237
01:45:32,416 --> 01:45:35,232
Shouldn't you be scared bigger materials just anti-semetic

2238
01:45:35,744 --> 01:45:36,512
There's no comparison

2239
01:45:36,768 --> 01:45:38,048
For well-thought-out research

2240
01:45:38,304 --> 01:45:38,816
Tire

2241
01:45:39,072 --> 01:45:39,584
This is just some

2242
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:40,864
Country train a dog

2243
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:41,632
Which is

2244
01:45:42,144 --> 01:45:48,288
That's a lot of effort to react

2245
01:45:49,824 --> 01:45:55,712
Most part of the article is that the comedians that are interviewed and the writer

2246
01:45:55,968 --> 01:45:56,480
You shouldn't be getting

2247
01:45:56,736 --> 01:45:57,504
Prosecute

2248
01:45:57,760 --> 01:45:58,272
That's just too

2249
01:45:58,528 --> 01:46:00,320
Too harsh but they also think he's a racist

2250
01:46:00,576 --> 01:46:03,392
Neo-Nazi hacked on the Free Speech Chris to make money

2251
01:46:03,904 --> 01:46:05,696
This is a conclusion that the article comes to

2252
01:46:07,744 --> 01:46:12,096
What that we should really do with Mark meechan is to leave him to make shity YouTube videos for America

2253
01:46:12,352 --> 01:46:13,888
Teenagers

2254
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:16,448
I can pick up no harsher punishment

2255
01:46:16,704 --> 01:46:18,496
Tommy Robinson interview

2256
01:46:18,752 --> 01:46:21,056
Leave him with the realization that his most earnest

2257
01:46:21,312 --> 01:46:22,848
Defenders are the ones wearing Jack

2258
01:46:24,128 --> 01:46:29,504
That last line is so great

2259
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:31,808
He is allowed to not wrestle with

2260
01:46:32,064 --> 01:46:34,112
Because of the position.

2261
01:46:36,160 --> 01:46:36,928
Is that like

2262
01:46:37,696 --> 01:46:38,208
The people

2263
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:39,232
Who

2264
01:46:39,488 --> 01:46:42,560
You are surrounded with and the only people who support you

2265
01:46:43,072 --> 01:46:43,840
They happen to be.

2266
01:46:44,096 --> 01:46:44,608
Scout

2267
01:46:45,376 --> 01:46:50,240
Make of that what you will you would think that that

2268
01:46:55,104 --> 01:46:58,176
There's so many comedians in Chicago

2269
01:46:59,200 --> 01:47:00,992
Heavy scare quotes around

2270
01:47:01,248 --> 01:47:04,576
You've been to so many open mics where guy has been there

Gross running for UK

2276
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:21,472
Into the line of like whether or not

2277
01:47:21,728 --> 01:47:22,752
You're allowed to call yourself

2278
01:47:23,008 --> 01:47:24,032
Comedian until

2279
01:47:24,288 --> 01:47:25,056
XYZ point

2280
01:47:25,312 --> 01:47:29,920
I don't want to do that

2281
01:47:30,176 --> 01:47:31,200
Yeah I like

2282
01:47:31,456 --> 01:47:34,784
So do I go f*** yourself count dankula

2283
01:47:35,296 --> 01:47:36,064
Because you call yourself

2284
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:36,832
Successful

2285
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:40,416
All behalf of all comedians you the f****** bird

2286
01:47:40,672 --> 01:47:42,464
No s***

2287
01:47:42,720 --> 01:47:47,328
Not as successful

2288
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:49,632
So I told you earlier

2289
01:47:49,888 --> 01:47:50,400
His staff

2290
01:47:50,656 --> 01:47:51,424
On the task

2291
01:47:52,448 --> 01:47:52,960
Popeyes

2292
01:47:53,216 --> 01:47:57,056
And now middle of this interview

2293
01:47:57,312 --> 01:47:58,336
Alex

2294
01:47:58,592 --> 01:47:59,104
Get the Popeyes

2295
01:48:01,408 --> 01:48:06,016
I should tell you that I know exactly what's going on okay

2296
01:48:08,064 --> 01:48:10,880
Story where there are people who are accusing birdiebee rapist

2297
01:48:11,392 --> 01:48:12,160
A chicken

2298
01:48:12,416 --> 01:48:13,184
Check

2299
01:48:13,696 --> 01:48:17,536
Good face arguments all I assumed in the same way

2300
01:48:17,792 --> 01:48:20,864
Keeps bringing up Vicky is also done the Nazi dogs

2301
01:48:22,656 --> 01:48:25,216
He is eating his chicken on are in a

2302
01:48:25,472 --> 01:48:31,616
Desperate attempt

2303
01:48:31,872 --> 01:48:33,664
Everingham

2304
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:36,480
Everpure stunts

2305
01:48:36,736 --> 01:48:38,016
But the way he does it is

2306
01:48:39,296 --> 01:48:41,088
Okay

2307
01:48:47,488 --> 01:48:48,512
The left says

2308
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:55,168
Is photographs

2309
01:48:56,192 --> 01:48:57,472
What else

2310
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:03,872
Northern projection

2311
01:49:06,176 --> 01:49:11,552
Wewatchit

2312
01:49:16,416 --> 01:49:17,696
It was wrong

2313
01:49:18,464 --> 01:49:19,744
And the right-wing jumped on it

2314
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:24,864
Because

2315
01:49:32,288 --> 01:49:36,640
Really screwed up

2316
01:49:36,896 --> 01:49:40,480
Restaurants

2317
01:49:43,296 --> 01:49:48,672
Another food

2318
01:49:51,488 --> 01:49:53,536
Pizza Popeye's fried chicken

2319
01:49:58,656 --> 01:49:59,680
Which is really really good

2320
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:01,472
Again

2321
01:50:01,984 --> 01:50:03,008
The idea

2322
01:50:03,776 --> 01:50:06,336
Everything is racist everything is bad they are

2323
01:50:16,832 --> 01:50:17,856
That was f******

2324
01:50:25,536 --> 01:50:27,584
This is not a sponsor

2325
01:50:27,840 --> 01:50:29,888
Pathetic attempt

2326
01:50:30,144 --> 01:50:34,240
To get some sort of run off press coverage of like

2327
01:50:34,496 --> 01:50:35,520
No one is going to do that

2328
01:50:35,776 --> 01:50:41,152
Bernie Sanders

2329
01:50:41,408 --> 01:50:42,944
Everybody knows

2330
01:50:44,224 --> 01:50:44,736
Do they have Spa

2331
01:50:46,272 --> 01:50:46,784
Jordan

2332
01:50:47,552 --> 01:50:49,600
I need to know that cuz if your Popeyes

2333
01:50:49,856 --> 01:50:50,880
Add a Scottish person

2334
01:50:51,136 --> 01:50:51,904
Who's never had Popeyes

2335
01:50:52,416 --> 01:50:53,184
That's just rude

2336
01:50:53,440 --> 01:50:54,720
That's rude

2337
01:50:54,976 --> 01:50:58,304
Deep irony that Alex Jones is doing this Fried Chicken racism

2338
01:50:58,560 --> 01:51:00,352
He's well he's interviewing a Scottish alleged

2339
01:51:00,608 --> 01:51:01,632
Comedian count dankula

2340
01:51:01,888 --> 01:51:02,400
You know why

2341
01:51:03,168 --> 01:51:03,936
Cuz the Scottish Inn

2342
01:51:04,192 --> 01:51:04,960
Invented fried

2343
01:51:05,472 --> 01:51:11,616
The Scottish invent Fried Chicken

2344
01:51:12,640 --> 01:51:15,200
American tradition not South America

2345
01:51:15,456 --> 01:51:17,504
American South tradition of Rights

2346
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:18,784
Is the synthesis of the spices

2347
01:51:21,600 --> 01:51:22,368
Pan-frying techniques

2348
01:51:22,624 --> 01:51:23,904
It's from the Scottish combined

2349
01:51:24,672 --> 01:51:25,184
Slavery

2350
01:51:25,696 --> 01:51:29,536
Studies of migration patterns in the early America early American history

2351
01:51:29,792 --> 01:51:32,096
Reflected the Protestant Irish immigrants

2352
01:51:32,352 --> 01:51:34,400
Arrived early on settled largely

2353
01:51:34,656 --> 01:51:35,680
Virginia North Carolina

2354
01:51:35,936 --> 01:51:36,448
Tennessee

2355
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:37,984
As opposed to

2356
01:51:38,240 --> 01:51:38,752
Catholic IRA

2357
01:51:40,032 --> 01:51:40,544
Cities along

2358
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:41,312
East Coast

2359
01:51:41,568 --> 01:51:43,360
Much of this is theorize to be because the

2360
01:51:43,616 --> 01:51:47,968
The Scot Irish were generally poor and were pushed to the underdeveloped Border regions

2361
01:51:48,224 --> 01:51:48,736
The country

2362
01:51:49,248 --> 01:51:50,272
In many ways the Scottish

2363
01:51:50,528 --> 01:51:51,040
Built

2364
01:51:51,296 --> 01:51:53,856
Which would eventually tried to secede from the country because they couldn't

2365
01:51:55,392 --> 01:51:58,208
And in between those two

2366
01:51:58,464 --> 01:51:59,744
In between those two things

2367
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:01,536
The Scottish Building 1000

2368
01:52:01,792 --> 01:52:02,560
Receipt over slavery

2369
01:52:03,328 --> 01:52:04,096
How does techniques

2370
01:52:04,352 --> 01:52:05,888
An African flavors combined

2371
01:52:06,144 --> 01:52:06,912
Create American

2372
01:52:07,168 --> 01:52:08,704
South style fried chicken

2373
01:52:09,472 --> 01:52:11,008
None of this is to damanhur anything kits

2374
01:52:11,264 --> 01:52:12,800
No idea about this

2375
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:16,896
He's talking to a f****** Scottish

2376
01:52:21,504 --> 01:52:27,648
The pejorative Association of black people and fried chicken dates back to those days of slavery when slaves weren't allowed to own

2377
01:52:30,720 --> 01:52:34,048
After slavery ended the association lingered as a way to make fun of a

2378
01:52:34,304 --> 01:52:35,328
Mocking other

2379
01:52:36,864 --> 01:52:37,632
First and that it's really

2380
01:52:38,144 --> 01:52:39,680
Simple hits.

2381
01:52:42,496 --> 01:52:46,080
Manufactured fake outrage being peddled by the right-wing right

2382
01:52:46,336 --> 01:52:47,360
Calling Bernie races

2383
01:52:47,616 --> 01:52:49,920
For holding up a drumstick while being photographed with

2384
01:52:50,176 --> 01:52:51,456
The guy who's cooking said drums

2385
01:52:51,968 --> 01:52:52,992
I didn't know that I was

2386
01:52:53,248 --> 01:52:53,760
The right-wing

2387
01:52:54,016 --> 01:52:55,040
Is do that doing that

2388
01:52:55,296 --> 01:52:55,808
Imperative

2389
01:52:56,320 --> 01:52:57,600
The the lab

2390
01:52:57,856 --> 01:52:58,368
Yeah

2391
01:52:58,880 --> 01:53:00,160
But that's not accurate either

2392
01:53:00,416 --> 01:53:02,464
Because when you talk about the other instead

2393
01:53:03,232 --> 01:53:03,744
David is like

2394
01:53:04,256 --> 01:53:04,768
Bill Clinton

2395
01:53:05,792 --> 01:53:06,560
That was two years

2396
01:53:07,584 --> 01:53:11,424
I can only find right-wing media people talking about

2397
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:12,704
That is racist thing

2398
01:53:12,960 --> 01:53:14,240
Oh and weirdly RT

2399
01:53:14,496 --> 01:53:18,848
It was the only places that were covering

2400
01:53:19,104 --> 01:53:20,384
Thinks that he doesn't like

2401
01:53:21,152 --> 01:53:21,920
I don't know why

2402
01:53:22,176 --> 01:53:22,688
I don't know why

2403
01:53:23,200 --> 01:53:25,504
I don't either but like a those the only places that I can

2404
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:26,784
Confined for coverage

2405
01:53:27,296 --> 01:53:28,832
I did find an article on Fox

2406
01:53:29,088 --> 01:53:30,880
Randonautica

2407
01:53:32,416 --> 01:53:36,000
Fried Chicken in Louisiana

2408
01:53:38,816 --> 01:53:41,632
Restaurant but there is literally spelled out the article

2409
01:53:42,144 --> 01:53:46,496
To be honest we're surprised that we didn't see Morpho rage on Twitter over this

2410
01:53:46,752 --> 01:53:51,104
They're making fun of the idea that there would be fake outrage

2411
01:53:51,616 --> 01:53:57,760
The only people expressing outrage Roblox like the American mirror and Truth Revolt or message board threads on clock

2412
01:53:58,528 --> 01:54:00,576
He's pretending that the media covered it

2413
01:54:03,904 --> 01:54:07,488
Right-wing stuff the whole time

2414
01:54:09,024 --> 01:54:13,888
Because of what this really what amount do is Bernie Sanders is like a Curb Your Enthusiasm

2415
01:54:14,912 --> 01:54:15,936
We're all the sudden

2416
01:54:18,240 --> 01:54:18,752
He's been

2417
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:21,312
Erases the whole time and then he's a

2418
01:54:21,568 --> 01:54:22,080
Accidentally getting

2419
01:54:22,336 --> 01:54:23,616
A photo op

2420
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:28,992
Yeah

2421
01:54:29,248 --> 01:54:31,040
I just

2422
01:54:31,296 --> 01:54:31,808
Explicitly clear

2423
01:54:32,064 --> 01:54:33,856
Pretending that

2424
01:54:34,368 --> 01:54:35,136
Does the

2425
01:54:35,392 --> 01:54:37,696
And now the game

2426
01:54:37,952 --> 01:54:38,720
And that is

2427
01:54:38,976 --> 01:54:39,488
Default

2428
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:41,024
Explanation

2429
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:43,328
It's the right was doing that another rated

2430
01:54:43,584 --> 01:54:44,608
Discontinue into do that

2431
01:54:45,120 --> 01:54:47,424
Well I think he says that

2432
01:54:47,680 --> 01:54:49,984
He's he's referencing like all the time

2433
01:54:50,496 --> 01:54:52,288
The left is correctly pointed out that the

2434
01:54:52,544 --> 01:54:53,056
The people on the writer

2435
01:54:53,312 --> 01:54:59,456
Obama fried chicken restaurants

2436
01:54:59,968 --> 01:55:06,112
Understanding

2437
01:55:07,136 --> 01:55:07,904
He's

2438
01:55:08,160 --> 01:55:10,208
He's taking the wrong example

2439
01:55:10,720 --> 01:55:11,488
7 strong

2440
01:55:14,304 --> 01:55:15,072
Express

2441
01:55:16,096 --> 01:55:16,608
And I don't.

2442
01:55:17,120 --> 01:55:18,144
Very much

2443
01:55:19,424 --> 01:55:20,448
Alex

2444
01:55:21,472 --> 01:55:22,240
We'll see how he responds

2445
01:55:26,080 --> 01:55:32,224
Nazi salute and a Jewish man's face then yes I would understand if that caused a little

2446
01:55:33,248 --> 01:55:36,064
Do you understand

2447
01:55:36,320 --> 01:55:37,600
Hold on

2448
01:55:37,856 --> 01:55:42,464
You do know you you're saying you understand

2449
01:55:45,024 --> 01:55:45,792
Would offend

2450
01:55:46,048 --> 01:55:48,096
Would offend people and you would think that's Justified

2451
01:55:51,936 --> 01:55:57,312
Connie say that basically selling Fried Chicken on event that black people

2452
01:55:57,568 --> 01:56:00,384
Which everybody like fried chicken

2453
01:56:00,640 --> 01:56:04,480
Play everybody like fried chicken

2454
01:56:07,552 --> 01:56:13,696
What a pro

2455
01:56:14,976 --> 01:56:18,560
Contender for life's very fragile

2456
01:56:20,096 --> 01:56:26,240
This is a broadcaster here man for years on Aerotech

2457
01:56:26,496 --> 01:56:27,520
Drops God

2458
01:56:27,776 --> 01:56:31,616
No I think he's f****** with everybody

2459
01:56:31,872 --> 01:56:33,920
What is an anybody make any f****** sense

2460
01:56:34,176 --> 01:56:35,456
The only thing that makes sense

2461
01:56:35,712 --> 01:56:40,320
In a world where people are not in arguably

2462
01:56:40,576 --> 01:56:42,624
Is that they're all f****** with each other back in

2463
01:56:42,880 --> 01:56:45,440
Unable to understand

2464
01:56:45,696 --> 01:56:47,488
This kind of insanity leads me

2465
01:56:47,744 --> 01:56:48,768
To think that you might have been

2466
01:56:49,024 --> 01:56:49,792
Might have been having a

2467
01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:53,632
I meant also

2468
01:56:54,400 --> 01:56:56,704
First and on the 22nd he's almost

2469
01:56:56,960 --> 01:56:58,496
Half an hour late starting to show

2470
01:56:59,008 --> 01:57:04,128
He shows up 20-something minutes into the broadcast special reports

2471
01:57:05,664 --> 01:57:06,176
Tapes.

2472
01:57:06,688 --> 01:57:07,456
Alex Roldan

2473
01:57:07,712 --> 01:57:08,224
Bo

2474
01:57:09,248 --> 01:57:12,576
He is in a f****** mood that seems like how I would feel in a hangover

2475
01:57:13,600 --> 01:57:19,744
Our worst fears confirmed the worst

2476
01:57:22,816 --> 01:57:28,960
Congressman Larry McDonald

2477
01:57:29,216 --> 01:57:30,496
Water

2478
01:57:33,568 --> 01:57:35,360
Joseph McCarthy

2479
01:57:36,128 --> 01:57:39,456
Turn out exactly what we face

2480
01:57:41,248 --> 01:57:42,784
Everytime I try to go on air

2481
01:57:43,040 --> 01:57:44,576
I hate myself

2482
01:57:45,344 --> 01:57:47,136
I feel like a complete failure

2483
01:57:47,648 --> 01:57:48,928
Because I cannot summon

2484
01:57:50,720 --> 01:57:52,768
Oratory skills

2485
01:57:53,024 --> 01:57:54,816
Properly convey you

2486
01:57:55,328 --> 01:58:00,192
We're dealing with yourself

2487
01:58:00,448 --> 01:58:01,984
I bet you have a same feeling

2488
01:58:04,032 --> 01:58:05,824
Seems like he's waiting for the Alka-Seltzer to

2489
01:58:06,080 --> 01:58:06,848
Cricinfo

2490
01:58:07,104 --> 01:58:10,688
I hate myself when I try to start it shows that I'm not good enough

2491
01:58:11,200 --> 01:58:12,480
Convince you that the commies

2492
01:58:12,736 --> 01:58:13,248
They're coming in

2493
01:58:15,808 --> 01:58:17,856
I don't know it could just be that he was running late

2494
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:19,904
Piano

2495
01:58:21,952 --> 01:58:23,232
Making such a big

2496
01:58:23,744 --> 01:58:25,280
Show of that Fried Chicken

2497
01:58:29,120 --> 01:58:30,400
Feel like a sober decision

2498
01:58:31,424 --> 01:58:31,936
Goodfair

2499
01:58:32,192 --> 01:58:34,496
Give me the Fried Chicken on Ayers

2500
01:58:35,776 --> 01:58:37,312
Man he feels it feels like

2501
01:58:37,568 --> 01:58:38,080
Keep packing it in

2502
01:58:38,336 --> 01:58:39,872
It really does feel like

2503
01:58:40,128 --> 01:58:46,272
Winding down like this is that

2504
01:58:46,528 --> 01:58:49,600
Class and all the sudden he has Popeyes delivered and everybody's looking at him like you

2505
01:58:49,856 --> 01:58:51,136
He's a hero Captain teacher hates

2506
01:58:53,696 --> 01:58:54,976
Six-month somebody back in my old

2507
01:58:55,232 --> 01:58:58,560
Studio

2508
01:59:00,608 --> 01:59:01,120
To this next

2509
01:59:01,376 --> 01:59:02,656
Business here on the

2510
01:59:02,912 --> 01:59:03,424
The 22nd

2511
01:59:05,984 --> 01:59:06,752
Like we know that he thinks

2512
01:59:07,008 --> 01:59:08,032
A gun

2513
01:59:08,544 --> 01:59:09,056
Civil War

2514
01:59:10,080 --> 01:59:10,592
If you

2515
01:59:10,848 --> 01:59:11,616
I mean

2516
01:59:11,872 --> 01:59:12,384
Think about lake house

2517
01:59:12,640 --> 01:59:13,152
Soldiers

2518
01:59:14,176 --> 01:59:14,688
Civil War

2519
01:59:15,712 --> 01:59:17,504
I guess if more people get kicked off Twitter

2520
01:59:17,760 --> 01:59:20,320
Civil War

2521
01:59:20,576 --> 01:59:21,600
And it will cause a civil war

2522
01:59:22,112 --> 01:59:22,624
The equation

2523
01:59:22,880 --> 01:59:24,160
Time to get into

2524
01:59:24,672 --> 01:59:26,720
College means

2525
01:59:30,304 --> 01:59:31,328
You break the country

2526
01:59:33,120 --> 01:59:34,144
At least politically

2527
01:59:34,912 --> 01:59:37,216
It will turn into a Mindless Civil War

2528
01:59:37,728 --> 01:59:39,264
Everything leads to us

2529
01:59:39,520 --> 01:59:40,544
Sybil f****** Warfare

2530
01:59:41,568 --> 01:59:42,592
Yeah yeah that's

2531
01:59:42,848 --> 01:59:48,224
Breaking the Electoral College would really like the idea of the

2532
01:59:48,480 --> 01:59:49,248
The popular vote

2533
01:59:49,760 --> 01:59:50,272
Elect

2534
01:59:50,528 --> 01:59:52,832
Sing the president everyone would lose their ship

2535
01:59:53,344 --> 01:59:57,440
There will be a civil war.

2536
01:59:57,696 --> 02:00:00,768
If people didn't know exactly how many delegates

2537
02:00:01,024 --> 02:00:02,816
We're going to go

2538
02:00:04,608 --> 02:00:06,656
People would lose their s***

2539
02:00:06,912 --> 02:00:07,424
4

2540
02:00:07,936 --> 02:00:08,704
Civil War

2541
02:00:08,960 --> 02:00:11,264
I don't pretend to know what the intentions

2542
02:00:12,032 --> 02:00:13,568
Of the people the people who

2543
02:00:14,336 --> 02:00:15,872
Created the electoral college system work

2544
02:00:16,128 --> 02:00:17,920
It's very hard to argue against the

2545
02:00:18,176 --> 02:00:22,528
The conclusion that the real-world impact diminishment of minority vote

2546
02:00:22,784 --> 02:00:24,576
This is not a new thought

2547
02:00:24,832 --> 02:00:25,344
The globalist

2548
02:00:25,600 --> 02:00:29,440
They're just throwing out now it was discussing the paper put out by the gate

2549
02:00:29,696 --> 02:00:30,208
296

2550
02:00:30,720 --> 02:00:33,024
They almost certainly, previously

2551
02:00:33,280 --> 02:00:36,352
This isn't some kind of Crybaby thought that's a knee-jerk reaction

2552
02:00:36,608 --> 02:00:37,632
Did the Democrats lose in the 20s

2553
02:00:37,888 --> 02:00:39,168
16 election is Alex wants to

2554
02:00:39,424 --> 02:00:43,776
Losing the 2000 election

2555
02:00:44,288 --> 02:00:50,176
Or the 1876 election

2556
02:00:50,688 --> 02:00:52,736
There's a movement for the states

2557
02:00:52,992 --> 02:00:54,272
Opt out of the Electoral College this

2558
02:00:54,784 --> 02:00:56,320
What's going on

2559
02:00:56,576 --> 02:00:57,344
The candidate that wins

2560
02:00:57,600 --> 02:00:58,624
The national popular vote

2561
02:00:59,136 --> 02:01:01,952
This be done by States and governors

2562
02:01:02,208 --> 02:01:02,720
Probably shouldn't have

2563
02:01:02,976 --> 02:01:03,488
Problem with it

2564
02:01:06,816 --> 02:01:08,096
I don't understand where you draw the line

2565
02:01:08,608 --> 02:01:11,680
And here's the issue Defenders of the Electoral College

2566
02:01:11,936 --> 02:01:14,240
Sometimes unless you know why

2567
02:01:14,496 --> 02:01:15,008
Support it

2568
02:01:15,264 --> 02:01:16,800
This was the case with Paul LePage

2569
02:01:17,056 --> 02:01:20,640
Former governor of Maine radio show back whatever you wear

2570
02:01:20,896 --> 02:01:21,408
Brickheadz

2571
02:01:21,664 --> 02:01:25,248
Why don't we just adopt the constitution of Venezuela and be done with it

2572
02:01:25,504 --> 02:01:29,344
What type of dictator because that's what you really you're going to is going to boil down to

2573
02:01:29,856 --> 02:01:36,000
What would happen if they do what they say they're going to do white people not have anything to say minorities

2574
02:01:36,256 --> 02:01:36,768
Who would elect

2575
02:01:38,560 --> 02:01:39,328
The argument

2576
02:01:39,584 --> 02:01:42,912
The Electoral College is that it allows a small group of Voters

2577
02:01:43,168 --> 02:01:45,216
Exert a disproportionate power over the election

2578
02:01:45,472 --> 02:01:47,776
Leslie Paige makes clear at least

2579
02:01:48,032 --> 02:01:48,544
Support for me

2580
02:01:49,056 --> 02:01:50,080
System

2581
02:01:50,336 --> 02:01:51,616
They replied

2582
02:01:51,872 --> 02:01:55,968
Up with the argument of the system is important because it allows

2583
02:01:56,224 --> 02:01:56,736
Control

2584
02:01:56,992 --> 02:01:57,760
So that's a strong argument

2585
02:01:58,528 --> 02:02:02,624
It's kind of silly that we still use the electoral college system quite frankly and honestly

2586
02:02:02,880 --> 02:02:04,160
Even sillier that almost

2587
02:02:04,672 --> 02:02:05,696
America Civil War

2588
02:02:05,952 --> 02:02:08,000
These days according to Alex

2589
02:02:08,256 --> 02:02:13,632
Already passed at least like 10 years ago

2590
02:02:13,888 --> 02:02:15,680
I don't know I don't I don't pretend

2591
02:02:15,936 --> 02:02:16,448
I have

2592
02:02:16,704 --> 02:02:17,472
The fullest

2593
02:02:17,728 --> 02:02:19,008
Understand

2594
02:02:19,264 --> 02:02:19,776
Of the Arctic

2595
02:02:20,032 --> 02:02:21,312
Commence for and against the Electoral College

2596
02:02:21,568 --> 02:02:22,848
But the sense that I get

2597
02:02:23,104 --> 02:02:23,616
Is

2598
02:02:24,128 --> 02:02:24,640
Even

2599
02:02:24,896 --> 02:02:27,200
If you take away some of those new on Stark

2600
02:02:28,224 --> 02:02:28,736
It's f****** self

2601
02:02:28,992 --> 02:02:30,784
It's a ridiculous kratom

2602
02:02:31,040 --> 02:02:33,344
Silverado

2603
02:02:34,880 --> 02:02:38,464
That would be

2604
02:02:38,720 --> 02:02:43,840
More sense then everything would lead to a civil war

2605
02:02:44,608 --> 02:02:45,120
Get to Popeye's

2606
02:02:48,960 --> 02:02:49,728
My stomach

2607
02:02:50,496 --> 02:02:53,056
So this next clip involves Alex

2608
02:02:56,128 --> 02:02:57,920
About Hillary

2609
02:03:04,064 --> 02:03:05,344
Everybody

2610
02:03:06,112 --> 02:03:08,928
Blackwater Army

2611
02:03:10,976 --> 02:03:14,816
All good

2612
02:03:52,960 --> 02:03:53,728
What's the problem

2613
02:03:55,520 --> 02:03:56,544
So I don't know

2614
02:03:56,800 --> 02:03:58,592
Okay to respond to that other than

2615
02:03:58,848 --> 02:03:59,360
It's so funny

2616
02:03:59,872 --> 02:04:00,384
Think about

2617
02:04:00,896 --> 02:04:01,664
Lakeway the path

2618
02:04:02,176 --> 02:04:03,200
Like during the Iraq War

2619
02:04:04,480 --> 02:04:04,992
Alex

2620
02:04:05,248 --> 02:04:06,016
Imagining

2621
02:04:06,272 --> 02:04:06,784
29

2622
02:04:07,040 --> 02:04:08,064
Cdb bragging about talking

2623
02:04:08,320 --> 02:04:08,832
Me to Blackwater

2624
02:04:10,112 --> 02:04:10,624
It's really

2625
02:04:10,880 --> 02:04:11,392
Really weird

2626
02:04:13,184 --> 02:04:13,696
Good guys

2627
02:04:13,952 --> 02:04:18,816
Is good people in Blackwater the military and the CIA

2628
02:04:19,072 --> 02:04:25,216
Who would Alex reaching out to

2629
02:04:26,240 --> 02:04:31,104
So Alex has been here on the 22nd

2630
02:04:31,616 --> 02:04:32,640
Picture

2631
02:04:33,664 --> 02:04:37,504
Feather

2632
02:04:37,760 --> 02:04:38,784
What's a grievance

2633
02:04:39,040 --> 02:04:42,112
Certainly wouldn't apply to have even if it were true cuz it have to do with

2634
02:04:42,368 --> 02:04:42,880
College

2635
02:04:45,184 --> 02:04:50,048
Overwhelmingly

2636
02:04:51,328 --> 02:04:56,960
That there are massive amounts of colleges that are not black colleges

2637
02:04:59,520 --> 02:05:01,312
That have black only

2638
02:05:03,872 --> 02:05:05,408
Equation ceremonies

2639
02:05:07,200 --> 02:05:11,296
Not much. What that means

2640
02:05:11,808 --> 02:05:16,416
So I bet he could but I don't think he could actually cover the story he had that whole day

2641
02:05:17,440 --> 02:05:18,464
So what a shock

2642
02:05:18,976 --> 02:05:22,048
We stumble upon yet another case of right-wing

2643
02:05:22,304 --> 02:05:23,584
Misleading people about racial issue

2644
02:05:24,608 --> 02:05:27,424
What's going on here is it Alex's piggyback on reports out of the washing

2645
02:05:27,680 --> 02:05:28,192
Examiner

2646
02:05:28,448 --> 02:05:30,240
Which were heavily promoted by Charlie Kirk

2647
02:05:30,496 --> 02:05:31,776
Turning Point USA

2648
02:05:32,288 --> 02:05:34,080
The story here is about how lot of black

2649
02:05:34,336 --> 02:05:37,152
There are graduation ceremonies

2650
02:05:38,688 --> 02:05:39,456
According to this Legend

2651
02:05:39,712 --> 02:05:40,224
Investigation

2652
02:05:40,736 --> 02:05:43,296
But really the invented inspired all this coverage

2653
02:05:43,808 --> 02:05:45,088
Harvard had an alleged

2654
02:05:45,344 --> 02:05:47,136
Blacks only graduation ceremony

2655
02:05:47,392 --> 02:05:49,184
Does highlighting with propaganda

2656
02:05:49,696 --> 02:05:51,232
Deeply in League with white nationalist

2657
02:05:51,488 --> 02:05:52,256
Search sites called

2658
02:05:52,512 --> 02:05:53,536
Neo segregation

2659
02:05:54,560 --> 02:05:57,120
Of course Harvard ceremony

2660
02:05:57,632 --> 02:06:00,960
Only graduation ceremony

2661
02:06:03,008 --> 02:06:05,312
Explicitly been about how there were no whites allowed

2662
02:06:05,824 --> 02:06:06,592
This isn't true

2663
02:06:07,104 --> 02:06:09,664
The event was organized by the Harvard black Students Association

2664
02:06:10,176 --> 02:06:12,224
And was just about celebrating the achievements

2665
02:06:12,480 --> 02:06:13,248
Graduating

2666
02:06:13,504 --> 02:06:15,552
Students the literally everyone was welcome

2667
02:06:16,064 --> 02:06:16,576
Unimportant

2668
02:06:16,832 --> 02:06:18,368
No degrees work

2669
02:06:18,624 --> 02:06:19,648
Stanford during the

2670
02:06:20,160 --> 02:06:21,696
Because it wasn't an actual graduation

2671
02:06:22,720 --> 02:06:24,768
Rosa celebration

2672
02:06:25,792 --> 02:06:31,936
The water needs to be created like what that was being put forth by Alex and turning point because

2673
02:06:32,192 --> 02:06:33,216
What they really want

2674
02:06:33,472 --> 02:06:35,008
Do is eliminate all

2675
02:06:35,264 --> 02:06:37,056
Like a black student organization

2676
02:06:37,568 --> 02:06:39,616
Or lgbtq

2677
02:06:39,872 --> 02:06:42,432
But they can't really make that argument maintain their we're just

2678
02:06:42,688 --> 02:06:43,200
Pro free speech

2679
02:06:44,224 --> 02:06:44,736
Those Brits

2680
02:06:45,248 --> 02:06:47,040
Those two things have a very difficult time

2681
02:06:47,296 --> 02:06:48,064
Being

2682
02:06:49,856 --> 02:06:51,904
Varsity misrepresent events like this

2683
02:06:52,160 --> 02:06:54,464
In such a way as to make the point that they want to make

2684
02:06:54,720 --> 02:06:56,512
Well hiding behind manufactured outrage

2685
02:06:57,280 --> 02:06:58,560
This is a segregated

2686
02:06:58,816 --> 02:07:00,864
Graduation ceremony where no lights are allowed

2687
02:07:01,376 --> 02:07:06,496
A simple Google search could bring up Apple evidence of white people at the event celebrating along with their fellow students

2688
02:07:07,264 --> 02:07:09,824
Now is you immediately responded during the clip

2689
02:07:10,592 --> 02:07:11,360
I have very strong

2690
02:07:11,872 --> 02:07:12,384
Suspicion

2691
02:07:14,688 --> 02:07:16,224
Is it this is a way of responding to

2692
02:07:16,480 --> 02:07:18,016
The story of billionaire Robert Smith

2693
02:07:18,272 --> 02:07:20,320
When giving this year

2694
02:07:20,576 --> 02:07:21,856
Speech at Morehouse university

2695
02:07:22,112 --> 02:07:28,256
It is going to pay off the graduating class of students estimated 40 million dollars

2696
02:07:29,792 --> 02:07:34,144
Morehouse College is a historically black college at the alma mater of Martin Luther King

2697
02:07:34,912 --> 02:07:39,008
Important to point out that the student body of our house is overwhelmingly black or African American

2698
02:07:39,264 --> 02:07:39,776
But not entirely

2699
02:07:40,032 --> 02:07:42,848
More than welcome to apply

2700
02:07:43,104 --> 02:07:43,616
School

2701
02:07:43,872 --> 02:07:45,664
This is probably something that races

2702
02:07:45,920 --> 02:07:46,688
Sister not thrilled about

2703
02:07:46,944 --> 02:07:47,968
Cidl today

2704
02:07:48,224 --> 02:07:50,784
Very benevolent

2705
02:07:57,440 --> 02:08:00,768
They should be more grateful that they get two little boys

2706
02:08:02,816 --> 02:08:07,168
This high-profile sincerely philanthropic gestures be a billionaire

2707
02:08:07,424 --> 02:08:09,728
Support of a graduating class at an overwhelming

2708
02:08:09,984 --> 02:08:11,008
School

2709
02:08:11,264 --> 02:08:12,800
The predictable that on the

2710
02:08:13,056 --> 02:08:14,592
Heels of that story

2711
02:08:14,848 --> 02:08:15,360
What would it

2712
02:08:15,616 --> 02:08:19,456
Who is some kind of a propaganda narrative demonizing black people in college setting

2713
02:08:19,712 --> 02:08:20,480
So I don't

2714
02:08:23,296 --> 02:08:24,576
The return of Ali

2715
02:08:24,832 --> 02:08:26,368
In some sort of a propaganda

2716
02:08:26,880 --> 02:08:28,160
Yep it's just that

2717
02:08:28,416 --> 02:08:29,184
It's very it's very sad

2718
02:08:29,952 --> 02:08:30,464
Because

2719
02:08:33,792 --> 02:08:36,864
60 years ago

2720
02:08:37,376 --> 02:08:39,936
Killing people so they wouldn't have to go to school with

2721
02:08:40,192 --> 02:08:40,704
With black people

2722
02:08:41,472 --> 02:08:45,824
And now it's 60 years later the same white people who would have killed

2723
02:08:46,080 --> 02:08:48,128
To not go to school with a black person

2724
02:08:48,640 --> 02:08:49,920
Here--now like

2725
02:08:50,176 --> 02:08:53,248
Why won't Black people with his be there even though we don't want to be

2726
02:08:53,760 --> 02:08:54,272
You

2727
02:08:55,552 --> 02:08:56,320
1

2728
02:08:56,576 --> 02:08:58,368
Things that Alex's

2729
02:08:59,392 --> 02:09:00,672
About

2730
02:09:00,928 --> 02:09:04,256
If I had a little bit more time I Nevada Supercut of to make my point

2731
02:09:04,512 --> 02:09:05,280
Is there any

2732
02:09:05,536 --> 02:09:07,328
Misty's all about not.

2733
02:09:07,584 --> 02:09:08,096
Violet

2734
02:09:08,352 --> 02:09:10,912
He's all about defense just like I

2735
02:09:19,616 --> 02:09:21,920
No big deal it's not I'm not instigating

2736
02:09:22,176 --> 02:09:23,456
Right

2737
02:09:25,760 --> 02:09:26,272
Certainly

2738
02:09:26,784 --> 02:09:28,576
Of that mentality

2739
02:09:30,880 --> 02:09:31,392
Offense

2740
02:09:32,160 --> 02:09:33,952
FIFA

2741
02:09:34,208 --> 02:09:35,744
Politically

2742
02:09:38,304 --> 02:09:38,816
Here's what he had to say

2743
02:09:40,352 --> 02:09:41,632
They're committing all these crimes

2744
02:09:41,888 --> 02:09:43,936
It's just insane

2745
02:09:44,192 --> 02:09:46,240
I watched a family on the office

2746
02:09:46,496 --> 02:09:47,776
Or they destroy the country

2747
02:09:48,032 --> 02:09:51,360
They know that we're on our last legs that get rid of trump

2748
02:09:53,664 --> 02:09:57,760
Pushed on it you probably like

2749
02:09:58,272 --> 02:09:59,552
But I don't trust his audience

2750
02:09:59,808 --> 02:10:00,576
To be able to

2751
02:10:00,832 --> 02:10:01,600
To discern the nuance

2752
02:10:01,856 --> 02:10:02,880
Between them that likes

2753
02:10:03,136 --> 02:10:04,928
If we don't go on the offense

2754
02:10:05,440 --> 02:10:05,952
We

2755
02:10:06,208 --> 02:10:07,232
Lou's the country

2756
02:10:07,744 --> 02:10:08,512
Forget exist

2757
02:10:08,768 --> 02:10:09,792
Sort of language

2758
02:10:10,048 --> 02:10:10,816
Exist

2759
02:10:11,072 --> 02:10:11,584
The contact

2760
02:10:12,096 --> 02:10:15,168
In the body of the show it exists

2761
02:10:15,936 --> 02:10:16,704
Defensive violence

2762
02:10:17,472 --> 02:10:21,568
I do not explicitly encouraging violence but

2763
02:10:21,824 --> 02:10:22,848
Easy interpretation

2764
02:10:24,384 --> 02:10:25,408
I think that is someone

2765
02:10:26,176 --> 02:10:27,456
In the space that Alex

2766
02:10:27,712 --> 02:10:28,224
Existing

2767
02:10:28,480 --> 02:10:30,272
Has a responsibility to not be

2768
02:10:30,528 --> 02:10:31,040
That

2769
02:10:32,320 --> 02:10:33,344
That's your response

2770
02:10:36,160 --> 02:10:36,672
Speaking biersbach

2771
02:10:38,464 --> 02:10:41,024
Towards the end of this episode Alex has Millie Weaver

2772
02:10:41,536 --> 02:10:43,072
Studio 28

2773
02:10:43,840 --> 02:10:44,352
Graceful

2774
02:10:44,864 --> 02:10:45,632
Better Business

2775
02:10:45,888 --> 02:10:46,400
About

2776
02:10:46,656 --> 02:10:47,680
Her going to an abortion

2777
02:10:47,936 --> 02:10:48,448
Rally

2778
02:10:48,704 --> 02:10:50,240
Everyone there

2779
02:10:51,264 --> 02:10:52,544
3 years old

2780
02:10:53,056 --> 02:10:55,872
And I won't answer any questions

2781
02:10:57,664 --> 02:11:03,040
Think you're asking questions that imply an answer

2782
02:11:03,296 --> 02:11:04,320
Why do you want to kill baby

2783
02:11:04,832 --> 02:11:06,624
Cuz they're delicious

2784
02:11:11,488 --> 02:11:15,840
To fuk with you

2785
02:11:17,120 --> 02:11:18,912
Here to support killing babies

2786
02:11:19,168 --> 02:11:22,496
That's the way your framing the question is why you no matter how I answer

2787
02:11:23,008 --> 02:11:23,776
You're playing a game

2788
02:11:24,288 --> 02:11:25,056
Is left

2789
02:11:25,312 --> 02:11:26,080
What's going on with that

2790
02:11:30,432 --> 02:11:31,968
They're not even talking about those bills

2791
02:11:33,504 --> 02:11:36,832
They're covering abortion in the exact same way they always have

2792
02:11:37,088 --> 02:11:39,136
This Beast bills are almost like a non-issue.

2793
02:11:39,648 --> 02:11:41,696
It's just the logical 8

2794
02:11:41,952 --> 02:11:43,744
Conclusion like that build

2795
02:11:45,792 --> 02:11:46,560
Lay low

2796
02:11:46,816 --> 02:11:48,864
Yeah we don't want to f*** anything up

2797
02:11:49,120 --> 02:11:50,144
Exactly

2798
02:11:50,400 --> 02:11:50,912
Because he knows

2799
02:11:52,960 --> 02:11:55,520
Things are out

2800
02:11:55,776 --> 02:11:59,872
And he knows that that process works with or without any propaganda adjective

2801
02:12:00,640 --> 02:12:02,432
He can only screw things up

2802
02:12:02,688 --> 02:12:04,224
That's kind of the feeling that I get

2803
02:12:04,480 --> 02:12:05,504
The end inasmuch as he

2804
02:12:06,528 --> 02:12:08,064
We talk about those things

2805
02:12:08,320 --> 02:12:09,600
They would be

2806
02:12:11,136 --> 02:12:12,416
For someone like him

2807
02:12:13,184 --> 02:12:14,464
Part of his brand

2808
02:12:14,720 --> 02:12:16,512
Is Central piece of his bread

2809
02:12:16,768 --> 02:12:17,280
Pro-life

2810
02:12:17,536 --> 02:12:21,632
Yeah but the idea of actually following through with it

2811
02:12:23,424 --> 02:12:28,800
Because he had a pro-life country

2812
02:12:29,056 --> 02:12:33,152
The question to be settled

2813
02:12:33,408 --> 02:12:35,712
At least you wouldn't have had

2814
02:12:35,968 --> 02:12:36,992
Did too when he was younger

2815
02:12:37,504 --> 02:12:39,552
Now that he's older he might be fine

2816
02:12:40,064 --> 02:12:41,856
Applying those standards on people

2817
02:12:42,112 --> 02:12:43,136
He doesn't

2818
02:12:43,392 --> 02:12:44,928
Feel what they're going through

2819
02:12:45,184 --> 02:12:46,976
I said I kind of suspect that he's

2820
02:12:51,072 --> 02:12:56,192
I would say that he himself has got an abortion hotline

2821
02:12:56,448 --> 02:13:01,824
This is a red phone that's the only one

2822
02:13:02,080 --> 02:13:02,592
The button

2823
02:13:03,104 --> 02:13:05,152
The only reason I'm going to allow you to

2824
02:13:05,408 --> 02:13:06,176
You suggest that is

2825
02:13:06,432 --> 02:13:06,944
Because of his own

2826
02:13:07,968 --> 02:13:08,992
And I'm not going to say it

2827
02:13:15,648 --> 02:13:17,184
Rather live in pro-choice

2828
02:13:17,440 --> 02:13:18,208
World

2829
02:13:18,464 --> 02:13:19,232
Probably

2830
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:21,792
It's it's an interesting question I don't know

2831
02:13:22,304 --> 02:13:24,608
Care I don't care about him and Millie's coverage

2832
02:13:26,400 --> 02:13:26,912
And manipulative

2833
02:13:27,680 --> 02:13:31,776
But there's one point though where they're talking about how loyal Trump is

2834
02:13:32,288 --> 02:13:33,312
And how important Alex

2835
02:13:33,568 --> 02:13:35,872
He's in the Trump World or whatever

2836
02:13:36,128 --> 02:13:36,896
Which is not at all

2837
02:13:37,152 --> 02:13:38,176
How is the reason

2838
02:13:38,944 --> 02:13:39,456
Interesting is B

2839
02:13:39,712 --> 02:13:40,224
Because

2840
02:13:40,480 --> 02:13:41,760
Not too far back

2841
02:13:42,016 --> 02:13:44,320
Alex was turning on Trump use only

2842
02:13:44,832 --> 02:13:46,112
We've been like a month or two

2843
02:13:46,368 --> 02:13:47,392
In the past but he's like

2844
02:13:47,648 --> 02:13:49,184
Turn on drop

2845
02:13:49,440 --> 02:13:50,464
This guy's a f****** a******

2846
02:13:51,232 --> 02:13:53,536
Because Trump is signaling that he's going to

2847
02:13:53,792 --> 02:13:55,584
Enact rules that might help out

2848
02:13:55,840 --> 02:13:57,888
Skip back on social media

2849
02:13:58,144 --> 02:13:59,424
Backup to a functioning

2850
02:13:59,680 --> 02:14:00,704
Position

2851
02:14:01,216 --> 02:14:01,728
Alex is

2852
02:14:01,984 --> 02:14:03,264
Fully on board with

2853
02:14:05,568 --> 02:14:07,872
Because on the other end of the stuff all explain what I think is

2854
02:14:09,152 --> 02:14:13,760
To any establishment

2855
02:14:14,016 --> 02:14:17,344
Rhino neocon

2856
02:14:17,600 --> 02:14:22,464
Blue Collar Americans

2857
02:14:22,720 --> 02:14:24,768
The people who live in white

2858
02:14:25,280 --> 02:14:29,888
They thought they could attack me in the name of trump

2859
02:14:32,192 --> 02:14:33,728
This works

2860
02:14:33,984 --> 02:14:36,544
And they cannot believe that they can't

2861
02:14:42,944 --> 02:14:47,040
Hey on your age

2862
02:14:47,296 --> 02:14:47,808
Do it

2863
02:14:49,344 --> 02:14:55,488
I'm not going to attack you for that as long as you stay true to the agenda of Americana and freedom in pro-life and God and Country

2864
02:14:55,744 --> 02:14:56,512
Free in the military

2865
02:15:12,896 --> 02:15:15,456
We're creating intelligent

2866
02:15:32,352 --> 02:15:33,376
I cannot stand it

2867
02:15:34,912 --> 02:15:37,472
Presenting it as I write reports that go straight

2868
02:15:37,728 --> 02:15:39,520
To the president because things are looking

2869
02:15:40,032 --> 02:15:43,360
Like trumps actions are more in line with what Alex

2870
02:15:43,872 --> 02:15:44,384
Is wanting him

2871
02:15:44,640 --> 02:15:45,152
To do

2872
02:15:45,408 --> 02:15:46,176
Ethos

2873
02:15:46,432 --> 02:15:47,456
Things weren't happening

2874
02:15:47,712 --> 02:15:48,736
Alex would be

2875
02:15:50,016 --> 02:15:50,528
Stuff like this

2876
02:15:50,784 --> 02:15:51,808
Because it's not true

2877
02:15:52,320 --> 02:15:52,832
Horse.

2878
02:15:53,088 --> 02:15:53,600
But here's why

2879
02:15:53,856 --> 02:15:54,368
What's going on

2880
02:15:55,392 --> 02:15:56,672
Trump is bacchanal

2881
02:15:58,208 --> 02:15:58,976
He's campaigning

2882
02:15:59,488 --> 02:16:00,256
These ideas

2883
02:16:00,512 --> 02:16:01,024
Pandering

2884
02:16:01,280 --> 02:16:03,328
To these people whooping kickoffs

2885
02:16:03,584 --> 02:16:07,168
They were the 12 agitated very important

2886
02:16:07,424 --> 02:16:08,192
16 election

2887
02:16:08,448 --> 02:16:08,960
Who helped

2888
02:16:10,240 --> 02:16:12,288
Create support for him and allowed

2889
02:16:12,544 --> 02:16:13,568
Camp Bow Wow

2890
02:16:14,080 --> 02:16:16,384
He is pandering in such a way because

2891
02:16:17,408 --> 02:16:18,432
The entire time

2892
02:16:18,944 --> 02:16:20,480
Since the election to

2893
02:16:20,736 --> 02:16:21,760
Pretty recently

2894
02:16:22,016 --> 02:16:22,528
There hasn't been

2895
02:16:22,784 --> 02:16:23,808
I mean outside of

2896
02:16:24,320 --> 02:16:26,112
Two things that a monster would do anyway like

2897
02:16:26,624 --> 02:16:29,952
Pardoning Joe Arpaio

2898
02:16:30,208 --> 02:16:33,024
Overtures that are things

2899
02:16:34,304 --> 02:16:35,072
That hasn't happened

2900
02:16:35,328 --> 02:16:39,680
But there have been things coupons

2901
02:16:40,192 --> 02:16:41,728
They're just constant disappointment

2902
02:16:41,984 --> 02:16:44,800
Not doing what I was wanting to do and how it's

2903
02:16:45,056 --> 02:16:47,872
Trying to rationalize staying on board or leaving

2904
02:16:48,128 --> 02:16:49,152
Should I go

2905
02:16:49,920 --> 02:16:51,456
This is campaign s***

2906
02:16:51,712 --> 02:16:52,736
Alex is falling for

2907
02:16:52,992 --> 02:16:54,272
S***

2908
02:16:54,784 --> 02:16:57,344
Because he's good he gets to feel

2909
02:16:57,600 --> 02:16:58,880
It gets the little f******

2910
02:16:59,136 --> 02:17:04,512
Scraps the Trump is throwing his be like hey I need you to

2911
02:17:04,768 --> 02:17:05,536
Beatles Don't

2912
02:17:05,792 --> 02:17:07,072
Get off the team

2913
02:17:07,328 --> 02:17:09,888
We're going to need you as this Camp ramps up

2914
02:17:10,144 --> 02:17:12,192
Here I'm going to pretend I'm going to

2915
02:17:12,448 --> 02:17:16,032
The next free speech rules that'll get you back on f****** self

2916
02:17:16,288 --> 02:17:21,664
Daddy read all my reports

2917
02:17:22,944 --> 02:17:26,528
I wonder how he felt about that report you wrote about Isis being up his dirty as well

2918
02:17:27,040 --> 02:17:28,576
Review with that report was

2919
02:17:30,368 --> 02:17:32,672
I think

2920
02:17:32,928 --> 02:17:33,440
Such a

2921
02:17:33,696 --> 02:17:37,024
Bootlicker on this because even in his own telling of this story

2922
02:17:37,280 --> 02:17:38,304
He gets

2923
02:17:39,072 --> 02:17:43,936
I'd like Trump even in his telling of the story goes like okay that sounds good I'll keep that in mind

2924
02:17:44,448 --> 02:17:44,960
Which is

2925
02:17:45,216 --> 02:17:48,800
Which is the classic brush off for it let's end this conversation

2926
02:17:49,312 --> 02:17:51,872
Alex is done that a million times to people

2927
02:17:52,384 --> 02:17:54,688
And I'm sure there's some reality

2928
02:17:54,944 --> 02:17:55,456
Me to that

2929
02:18:01,600 --> 02:18:04,160
So now Daddy's giving

2930
02:18:04,416 --> 02:18:05,952
Weibel

2931
02:18:06,208 --> 02:18:08,256
The story

2932
02:18:11,840 --> 02:18:12,864
It's just like come on man

2933
02:18:13,376 --> 02:18:15,168
Like when you talk about people who are obsessed

2934
02:18:15,424 --> 02:18:15,936
Put Hillary in

2935
02:18:16,960 --> 02:18:19,008
None of them act like this

2936
02:18:19,264 --> 02:18:20,288
Who's the sad

2937
02:18:20,544 --> 02:18:22,080
Replay what you want about Keith

2938
02:18:23,104 --> 02:18:23,616
A mess

2939
02:18:25,152 --> 02:18:27,456
Now that's

2940
02:18:28,224 --> 02:18:28,992
I mean they're both

2941
02:18:29,248 --> 02:18:30,784
Embarrassing in different ways

2942
02:18:35,392 --> 02:18:36,160
How much battery is

2943
02:18:39,488 --> 02:18:45,632
You want it you got it they keep showing me

2944
02:18:46,656 --> 02:18:47,680
Love it

2945
02:18:48,192 --> 02:18:49,728
I'm coming for you

2946
02:18:50,496 --> 02:18:51,520
I'm going to get you

2947
02:18:54,848 --> 02:18:55,360
God

2948
02:18:57,920 --> 02:19:04,064
You are going to be upon over by me

2949
02:19:04,320 --> 02:19:10,464
You're going to get it my hands are around your neck

2950
02:19:11,488 --> 02:19:17,376
Call Cheryl you heard from him

2951
02:19:17,632 --> 02:19:18,656
Today

2952
02:19:19,168 --> 02:19:21,472
Might have been a little more with Millie afterwards I don't really care

2953
02:19:21,984 --> 02:19:25,312
As someone who

2954
02:19:25,568 --> 02:19:26,080
Follows our

2955
02:19:26,336 --> 02:19:27,104
It's pretty closely

2956
02:19:36,320 --> 02:19:38,624
You are miserable Alex Jones

2957
02:19:38,880 --> 02:19:40,928
Macho political donkey wrestler

2958
02:19:41,184 --> 02:19:44,256
I mean

2959
02:19:44,768 --> 02:19:49,120
I would say that in terms of the recommendation that we cover it I think there is

2960
02:19:49,376 --> 02:19:52,192
There was some stuff that was the Popeyes

2961
02:19:52,448 --> 02:19:55,264
I think that there was more fun in here than the last

2962
02:19:55,520 --> 02:19:57,056
Stretch of present-day stuff

2963
02:19:57,312 --> 02:20:00,384
So as long as we're covering the present I do think we would have missed

2964
02:20:01,152 --> 02:20:02,432
Some good stuff

2965
02:20:05,760 --> 02:20:09,088
Hear Count Dracula say some f****** horrible things

2966
02:20:10,112 --> 02:20:13,440
Being someone who I'm aware of but I don't really give a s*** about you being like

2967
02:20:13,696 --> 02:20:19,072
No you suck go to worse than hatred

2968
02:20:19,328 --> 02:20:20,352
The start of transition that

2969
02:20:20,608 --> 02:20:22,144
Now I have a new person who I hate

2970
02:20:23,424 --> 02:20:27,776
That's good I would even upgrade him to some of the harder ice cream

2971
02:20:28,032 --> 02:20:29,312
Maybe some

2972
02:20:29,568 --> 02:20:34,688
Rum raisin or concrete

2973
