00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,736
Knowledge party.com

3
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
Pray I have great respect for its knowledge B I'm sick of them posing

00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:39,936
MoneyGram

00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,136
Dot-com

6
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:05,536
Acknowledge

7
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:09,632
The young man known as Alex Jones

8
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:15,008
And that's as much as I can get fancy on it

9
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,824
Is a little bit of Arissa little

10
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,152
Not quite the the intro that

11
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:22,176
Cement your legacy

12
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:26,016
Yeah so hey to Jordan

13
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:28,576
I have a question or you sir

14
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:30,624
Question

15
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:32,416
You go first

16
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:37,792
My bright spot then is restart the new season

17
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:39,584
Upgrade Pottery Throwdown

18
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:46,496
You know we've talked about the Great British baking show

19
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:52,896
And one of the judges is this guy who is an exceptional and incredible

20
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:58,784
Pottery maker emotional man

21
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,576
He cries like six

22
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:03,136
Episode

23
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:08,512
Paul Hollywood give them a handshake in your life who is weeping

24
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:14,912
He just cries and normally it would be like disingenuous bulshit but this time

25
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,728
He's f****** love Pottery too much

26
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:18,496
It's crazy

27
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:23,616
I may have that may give it a shot but that you're talking me out of it actively with it

28
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:25,152
It's amazing Tuesday

29
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:30,784
The pottery then no they don't

30
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,624
The coolest part is in the first season

31
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,928
There was the assistant guy who would do all the

32
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:40,512
The Kiln Pottery and then put it into the

33
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:41,280
You do the same

34
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:42,816
And then

35
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,608
At the beginning of the pandemic

36
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:45,376
They couldn't get

37
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,144
Co-host

38
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,704
So they gave him

39
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,728
Break the system

40
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,264
Diamond in the rough

41
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:56,896
Wow credible know who killed

42
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:59,456
To be a trans person who is kicking ass

43
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:04,064
It's amazing so we could hire another assistant but not another co-host

44
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,344
TV is the credit okay

45
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:09,952
It's cheaper to hire from within this is confusing but I'll give it a shot

46
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:15,328
I'm so happy my Brightspot Jordan humans

47
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,096
A little bit

48
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:18,912
I can sense

49
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:23,520
I had a bunch of little irons in the fire that are coming to fruition

50
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:26,592
Down the road and I feel I feel

51
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:33,248
I feel alive in the work which is getting a little bit frustrated for a little bit but I feel I feel

52
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,272
Second wind

53
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,296
Upon me

54
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,320
Also

55
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,088
Either something

56
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:39,136
For today and that is that I have a new text

57
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,672
Democrat drops out

58
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:47,584
Ooo-wee Aria

59
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,912
Bright spot of my shorts

60
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:53,728
The first Vivi that you're smart your nail polish

61
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,616
Do Yorkshire Stephen peeve

62
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:04,480
Yorkshire Stephen text americh not Emerick

63
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:06,272
Thank you so much you and I'll probably walk

64
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,720
I don't approve of this

65
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:17,280
No no more

66
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:23,679
Like we have three technocrats today to say thank you to in celebration of this.

67
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:29,055
So first I went on a road trip and all I got was addicted to this podcast thank you so much you're now a technocrat

68
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:29,823
Next

69
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:30,591
Mark

70
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:31,359
But not Mark Richard

71
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,639
Thank you so much you run out

72
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:34,431
Technocrat

73
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:39,551
An embed singing along to the theme song Jordan I'm sweating

74
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:40,575
You are now.

75
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,343
Technocrat

76
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,367
I'm a policy wonk

77
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,135
I have

78
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,415
Risen above

79
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:45,695
My enemies

80
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:52,351
Ali G for me

81
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:55,935
And then we're going to come back

82
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:57,727
And I'm going to

83
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,007
Start the show over

84
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,127
F*** you

85
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:07,967
For you but at the end of the day

86
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,015
F*** you and your new world order

87
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,063
She wrote in on

88
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,599
All your s***

89
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:14,879
Maybe the next few moments

90
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:18,207
Maybe I'll just be gone a month maybe 5 years

91
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,023
Maybe I'll walk out of here tomorrow

92
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,559
And you never see me again

93
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,863
That's really what I want to do

94
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,167
Back here again

95
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,703
I apologize to

96
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:33,823
Was legitimately having breakdowns on air

97
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:35,615
I'll be better tomorrow

98
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:42,015
Thank you so much as a little inspired by

99
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:47,903
Call the story picking up random things that he said I decided to

100
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:52,767
You really gave it and it was a whole paragraph honestly yeah yeah

101
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:53,535
It seems like

102
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,583
This could all be from the same episode

103
00:05:56,863 --> 00:06:00,191
100% could have been every 15 minutes you just cut

104
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:04,031
Play different clip that's what that's my favorite part about it it's a it's a Pastiche of

105
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:06,847
What kind of different episode where this Behavior

106
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,127
Japanese

107
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,151
Keep popping up

108
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:13,247
Today we have an episode to go over going to be talking

109
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:15,039
About January 13th

110
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,087
2022

111
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,391
And figure something out

112
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,415
Okay

113
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,719
On this episode of course

114
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:26,047
That is the day that Stewart Roads got popped

115
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,839
Duro's went down

116
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,119
Oh yeah

117
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,655
Oh yeah

118
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:33,727
Erodes the leader of the oath keeper and

119
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,519
Dear dear dear dear dear friend

120
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:38,079
Valic

121
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:41,407
Guest of Alex's show for 13 years

122
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,175
You would say

123
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,455
Thickest additional

124
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,295
You got arrested and apparently an FBI raid

125
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,319
Or something

126
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,367
Did the situation is kind of

127
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:53,183
Nebulous and I'm clear on the on this episode

128
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,463
Because the news break

129
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:56,255
Lakes in the middle of the episode

130
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,815
Spoiler alert get word of this

131
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:01,887
Cuz Alexander text him about it

132
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:06,495
Alexander has the scoop

133
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:08,799
Okay and Alex thinks he's got an exclusive

134
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,335
Two-story Antilles

135
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,615
He is pretty excited about it

136
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:13,663
IFixit

137
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:20,319
Maybe people expected Alex have a total freak out like RNR new technocrat drop right

138
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:27,231
He handles it shockingly well which actually leads me to Theory and we'll get to that theory over the course of

139
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,023
What episode of a Feeling

140
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,559
About 2 about

141
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,351
I think he knew this was coming

142
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,887
I think he knew when he

143
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:34,911
Chewed up at work

144
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,447
If there's a good chance

145
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,727
Stewart was going to get arrested

146
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:40,287
Imagine Stewart

147
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,567
Staffieri inkling that

148
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,591
It was going to happen

149
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:45,919
600 week we start to show off

150
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,199
Fanta Alex

151
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:48,223
Scott win

152
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:49,503
Of some

153
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,551
Chimera related issues

154
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,343
I told you they were going to

155
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:57,183
Human clones

156
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,207
Sheep

157
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:00,767
Cows

158
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:03,583
Gross human organs inside of them for transplant

159
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:08,447
You said I was crazy though was already happening before I was ever on the air

160
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,983
28 years ago

161
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:17,151
First perceives a heart from genetically altered

162
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,431
New York Times

163
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:25,087
If you're just listening to this show you might think of the New York Times is reporting that that pig was there was the source of the heart that was transplanted

164
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,879
The thing itself was part human

165
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,671
Because that's how Alex read the headline

166
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:31,487
But everybody

167
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:36,351
Alex is lying and adding things to the headline because that's the only way he can make himself sound interesting

168
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:38,911
It pays off the impression that he's always been right about every

169
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:43,775
The actual headline is quote in a first man receives heart from genetically alter

170
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:44,543
3rd pick

171
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,311
Alex is just

172
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:48,639
Decided he's going to report that the genetically altered part of this headline

173
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:51,967
It means that this big was part human but that's just him making

174
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:52,735
King stuff up

175
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:58,111
In reality the genetic alteration of the pig and undergone was a gene editing process quote

176
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:02,975
To remove a sugar in it sells that's responsible for hyper-fast organ rejection

177
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:07,327
This is one of the greatest challenges with organ transplanting

178
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,655
Even though in theory pig hearts are compatible with our bodies

179
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,679
He's generally speaking

180
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:16,799
Genetic alteration that removes the particular sugar

181
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:19,103
In terms of solving the gigantic problem

182
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,127
Of organ shortage

183
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,663
That the people will have

184
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,431
Then they need trance

185
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,199
Wow

186
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:27,039
Another important thing to keep in mind is that we don't actually know how well this is

187
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:27,807
Going to turn out

188
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:28,575
Just yet

189
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:35,487
The article in the AP about this note that back in 1980 for child named baby say was the recipient of a

190
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,767
Planted baboon heart

191
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:40,351
Actually survive for 21 days but then died

192
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:42,399
You're not far enough out from this

193
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:44,447
To know exactly how well this is going to work

194
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:49,823
This is wild stuff but it's not at all the kind of chimera shirt that Alex talks about all the time

195
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:56,479
He believes that there are fish with sad human eyes swimming around in tanks in the basement of the lab at the University of Austin

196
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,527
That's the level of thing he needs

197
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:02,367
Before he can claim any kind of I was actually write credibility

198
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:05,183
I'm not going to say that

199
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:07,743
Don't

200
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:10,815
Get where Alex is coming from because

201
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,351
When I hear

202
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,911
Genetically modified pig heart

203
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:15,935
Put into a man

204
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:18,239
I see the week before

205
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:21,055
Whenever they went temple of doom on a giant Pikmin

206
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:28,223
602 sterilize your hands

207
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,247
First

208
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,527
Cut around it.

209
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:32,063
It's to the skin is too thick

210
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:32,831
Yeah

211
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,367
I mean

212
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,415
Are we at we know this from list

213
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,439
To the show

214
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:40,767
I am talking about it just been a little bit mad recently

215
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:44,095
No argument for me

216
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:46,655
He's been mad that I think is

217
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:47,679
Bulshit

218
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,055
I tried my best and I prayed about it

219
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,359
ITube not get angry

220
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,895
And

221
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,431
The biggest thing is

222
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,735
Personally on us

223
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:03,295
Or show me where the top and so crazy

224
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:09,439
As a man it is almost like I don't even want to address it

225
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,207
Or talk about

226
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,999
What a set of brass balls.

227
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,047
This dude has to complain about personal attack

228
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:16,351
Being at this careers essentially been made on

229
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:20,191
Hey characterized by intense personal attacks on people based on lies

230
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,471
And misrepresentation

231
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:26,591
Don't care about whatever personal attacks Alex thinks he's dealing with

232
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:30,175
I wasn't doing show enough that I know when he says personal attacks

233
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,455
He means things like

234
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:35,807
Sandy Hook families suing him because of his personal tax on to them

235
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:41,183
He's awake baby you can't resist making himself a victim of every story because he thinks that somehow proves that he's

236
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,207
Under attack because

237
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:44,511
Cuz he's so right all the time and he's dangerous.

238
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:45,279
The system

239
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,559
Does the performance of Nursing

240
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:49,887
Anti consequences being misinterpreted

241
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:50,911
As

242
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:51,679
Integrity

243
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:55,775
You consider personal attack

244
00:11:56,031 --> 00:12:00,383
Let's brainstorm some personal tax would calling somebody a demon be a personality

245
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,663
Yeah

246
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,943
Saying that their faces

247
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,479
Hideous be a personal attack

248
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:06,783
I mean it's certainly

249
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:12,671
Would arguing that they were perhaps a pedophile cabal member

250
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,207
Be a personal attack

251
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,743
See him it seems like it okay

252
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:19,071
Well I think Alex might have been guilty of his own personal attack

253
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:20,863
I think

254
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:21,631
Vets

255
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:23,167
Like a lot of those

256
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,983
Senses that you're talkin about our public figures

257
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,007
+ 2

258
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:30,335
Like some degree yeah I kind of got a

259
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:31,615
Shake that off

260
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:34,687
Like Hillary Clinton's never going to really be all that could

261
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:36,735
Concerta

262
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:39,807
Private citizens on the other hand

263
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:42,623
Alex's personal checks on

264
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,391
Private

265
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:47,999
Petro

266
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,535
So bad

267
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:52,095
I'm talking about the personal taxi at the deal with oh yeah

268
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,119
Don't care

269
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:57,215
Alex I think his religion

270
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,263
Manteca

271
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,543
Lisa's uShip

272
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,615
I signed on to this I wanted to fight evil

273
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,663
I want to stand up against corruption

274
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,967
I am so blessed

275
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:10,271
And More Lies than ever been

276
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:14,111
Unbelievable

277
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,927
I'll be up to be someone alive God

278
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,463
I'll just say this more than

279
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:19,487
Caroline

280
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,023
For the average human

281
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,119
I'm just.

282
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:28,191
And I it's just people tell

283
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:29,983
That sucks

284
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:36,383
Let stuff go to cross to bear. Literally he's not that align with God

285
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,919
What a curved cross to bear

286
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:41,247
I feel like the Bible please remind memory other

287
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:43,295
Growing up in the trees Jesus

288
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,063
Going to also

289
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:47,391
Isn't particularly thrilled with people who use religion as a

290
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,159
Performance

291
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:53,279
I'm bragging about your connection with God on a radio shows probably something that most folks would use being

292
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,815
Lubbock distasteful

293
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,863
According to the Bible

294
00:13:57,119 --> 00:14:00,191
You know I remember him talking something about humility

295
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,471
Amanda

296
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,263
Boy

297
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,079
Claiming that you are closer to God than most people

298
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:09,663
Coraline's God than most people in the weird thing to say

299
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,431
Yeah it's

300
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:12,991
It's a probably exactly the opposite

301
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:18,623
Thing that the Bible would tell you is beside his clothes

302
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:21,183
Bet you would finally ends that sentence with

303
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:21,951
It hurt

304
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:28,351
Writers maybe you're not that closely aligned with Jesus at all the fires of hell

305
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:35,519
So this kind of weather versus this brings to mind is Matthew 6 verse 1

306
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,823
Beware of practicing your rights

307
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,895
Just missed before other people in order to be seen by them

308
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,943
For then you will have no Rewards

309
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,223
From your father who is in heaven

310
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:47,039
Later in that very same chapter quote

311
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:49,343
And when you pray you must not be like the HIPAA

312
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:54,975
Street corners

313
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:56,767
Truly I say to you

314
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,559
They have received their reward

315
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,863
Yeah I think we've talked

316
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:04,959
Many many a time about praying on are being super black

317
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,567
It's a it's a

318
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,871
Something goodbye was pretty clear but like

319
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,919
You're not going to get anything for this

320
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:16,223
Because the presentation of Raichu

321
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,271
Dismiss that you're you're tricking people with

322
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:22,623
That is your reward you have gotten it already. Whatever you need

323
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,903
Danger Millions don't

324
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,951
And gotta do is not going to give you s***

325
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,743
So what

326
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:28,767
Do you think Jordan

327
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,071
Last couple years

328
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:31,839
Coverage

329
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,399
And wrestling with this

330
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,679
What's covid about

331
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:36,959
Oh boy

332
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:38,751
Oh God

333
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:39,775
What's the plan

334
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:44,639
And every time you ask me this question I feel like I could come up with 6

335
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,407
Steam different ads

336
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,943
What do you think that over Arch

337
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:47,967
Plan is

338
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:49,759
The overarching plan

339
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:52,319
Is to replace humans

340
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,343
With

341
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,111
Cyborg

342
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:57,695
We've talked about that one I think that's the one I'm going to go with

343
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:04,095
Has been a plan at some point I feel like that's the one that's the winner for me not today

344
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,775
You know what all this is rather

345
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:14,079
This is a declaration of war

346
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:14,847
Criminal group

347
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:17,151
Hijacked our nation the world

348
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:20,735
Of exactly what they're going to do to you and me and everybody else

349
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,623
Training wheels

350
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:34,559
The military at the hospitals and

351
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:37,631
All of this is just a behavioral you ready

352
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:46,335
To soften us up for martial law

353
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,103
Oh

354
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:52,479
I thought it was to kill everyone I thought everyone was dead already

355
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:55,551
I'm going to take a nap already

356
00:16:56,063 --> 00:17:00,671
Recover the bioweapon

357
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,975
This is Bishop doesn't even make sense

358
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:04,511
I told like

359
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:06,815
What you have to do is understand that this is

360
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:10,655
Convoluted and impossible to follow because there is no Center to it out

361
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,423
What is preaching

362
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:15,775
Forget about the fact that there isn't a real world nefarious plan is covering

363
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:18,847
There isn't even a concrete plan that Alex has made up that

364
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:20,639
Explains everything that's going on

365
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:25,503
Do you have to jump around from framework to framework depending on what seems useful to him that day because

366
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,551
You just making up a story as he goes along

367
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:33,183
His heart and the weight of his career really drive him towards wanting to cover things as a plot to get us into Peabody

368
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,463
Can't specially him his body

369
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:36,767
But the real good money right now in the

370
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,559
Conspiracy world is anti-vax

371
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:39,327
Extremism

372
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,631
So it's hard to know which way to go sometime

373
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:42,911
He's lost

374
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:45,215
Spinning irreconcilable yarn

375
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:48,543
Because he has no idea what to do in an actual emergency

376
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:51,359
The only knows how to respond to fake ones that he's made two

377
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,639
The freak-out is audien

378
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:55,711
It still doesn't know what to do

379
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:56,735
He's just scrambling

380
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:59,807
Every single word he says is on the brink

381
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:02,111
At any moment I might topple off

382
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:05,951
Unlike some headline he read

383
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:13,119
I don't know what mood he's in whether or not he's hungover

384
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,911
Going into your mouth

385
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:16,703
Yeah it could be were all dead

386
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:20,543
Covid is a plan that they've had forever to depopulate the entire world

387
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,359
So the globalist can run around in their new Eden

388
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:28,991
That's one thing they could that could be there or he could be that all of this has just been an excuse

389
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,271
To bring in

390
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,039
Tops

391
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,831
In the in the hospitals

392
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:34,367
And checkpoints in order to

393
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,391
Soften us up

394
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:40,511
So they can breathe easier and I know I get that but if they're not going to

395
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:43,327
To kill us all and replace us all the cyborgs are like

396
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,351
Move into armored

397
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:46,911
Ridout's in and let everybody else die

398
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,751
We're doing just fine on the road to martial law without a

399
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:53,055
Global Escobar you know what I'm saying like

400
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,591
The regular old folks

401
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:58,431
They're on their marching towards martial law we don't need global

402
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:01,503
I want globalist to bring the heat

403
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:05,855
That's what I'm saying if you want something a little bit more creative weather weapons not just

404
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:06,879
The jackboot

405
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:13,279
He loved the government on my throat I think I might advise or you just be wait until Alex is in that kind of mood

406
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:17,375
Wait until there's a natural disaster that out

407
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:23,775
Explain away as not being a consequence

408
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:28,639
Right

409
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:31,199
Stuckey's if you will

410
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:34,015
American Republicans here

411
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:37,343
Terrorism plan

412
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:42,719
Opposition

413
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:45,279
Create one-party state

414
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:55,263
5 inch tall stack right here in others

415
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:56,799
Admissions

416
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:04,479
Republicans are terrorists

417
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,647
The new Nationwide group

418
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:13,183
Who's going to watch you

419
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,999
Control you

420
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:19,327
Teach you than white people

421
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,119
Alright

422
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:24,959
The end of the American Republic

423
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:27,263
The title of the show that he's in the middle of recording

424
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:30,335
That's the page that has the embedded video out

425
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,615
So that's awesome

426
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:34,687
Is kind of what

427
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,991
He hits on over and over and over again

428
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,527
In the beginning of this episode

429
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:41,855
This idea that this weekend of the Republican they're banning

430
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:43,903
Any kind of dissent in all this

431
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,695
It's so

432
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,487
Kind of focus

433
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:48,767
In that direction

434
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:52,351
Believe me to think that he knows that's who it's going to be

435
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:54,655
It seems it seemed almost like

436
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:55,935
Softening us up

437
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:57,471
For the blow of

438
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:00,031
See if they get Stewart

439
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:03,615
They're coming after you are very rarely Fifi Matic

440
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:06,687
Coherent

441
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:08,991
And this this to me felt like

442
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,015
Distinct

443
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:10,783
Pics of

444
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,063
Preparation

445
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:13,599
So Alex

446
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,135
And some other stuff you want

447
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:15,903
Let's talk about

448
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,952
That is how he's always right

449
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,000
Since I mentioned this

450
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,960
By c.s. Lewis

451
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:34,080
Screwtape letters

452
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:45,856
C.s. Lewis quotes

453
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:49,696
Sonny said he cannot

454
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:52,256
Present State understand eternity

455
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:55,072
That is what Mortals

456
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,352
Misunderstand

457
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:59,168
They say of some temporal suffering

458
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:01,984
No future Bliss can make up for it

459
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:04,032
Not knowing that heaven

460
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:05,312
Once attained

461
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:10,432
Even the glory

462
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:14,784
Pleasure they say

463
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:17,344
Let me have but this

464
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,904
The consequences

465
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:24,768
This is absolutely not from the screwtape letters I was about to say there's a countdown on it

466
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:25,792
Not being from the screwtape

467
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:28,608
That's the only CS Lewis book Alex

468
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:31,936
This is read or listen to sense a lot of the others

469
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:38,848
Also some of the ideas in like Mere Christianity or the problem of pain might be challenging to digest inator

470
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:39,616
I don't think he's up for

471
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:45,504
I guess he's probably maybe read The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe and I would guess what he thinks I has landed a globalist

472
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:52,672
Alex is obviously a fan of the screwtape letters because it's a work of fiction that's written as a series of correspondences between two demons

473
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,488
Who was written in 1942

474
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:57,024
Stickley recalled the book being

475
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,864
Very popular in the Evangelical community that I was apart of in my youth

476
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:05,216
I wouldn't be too surprised if it was a it wasn't a similar situation with Alex

477
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:06,240
Someday and growing up

478
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:09,568
Very accessible to

479
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:10,848
The church communities

480
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:11,616
Trivia

481
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:13,664
Be teacher in Calvin and Hobbes

482
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,712
Named after the screwtape letters

483
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:19,808
Is wormwood yeah

484
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:22,880
Constellation of the demon in the book it

485
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:25,440
Also I think that's Alex

486
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:30,560
Like I think you read the word son there and that's what made him think it was the screwtape letters

487
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:33,888
Cuz he's forgotten the demons in that are uncle and nephew not fathering

488
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:39,776
The cord that Alex's reading is actually from another of Lewis's novels titled the great divorce

489
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:41,056
Also I have

490
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:47,456
Absolutely no idea what this has to do with him like demonstrating that Alex has been right about anything cuz it's under the hashtag

491
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:51,296
Indication of him

492
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,064
Maybe

493
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,344
Racks cuz he insist

494
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,392
Play trumpet different book

495
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:56,416
Yeah that's a little kid

496
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:57,440
Confusing

497
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:58,464
This episode

498
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,232
Starts out

499
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:00,256
So boring

500
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,024
They

501
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,864
C.s. Lewis Miss quotes are where I'm at

502
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,888
That is a good point

503
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:09,728
Eddie in it on a good day we skip over him messing up c.s. Lewis

504
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:14,336
Sometimes that is a waste of our time for today

505
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:17,152
Today

506
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,176
Business

507
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:19,712
Pics the f*** out

508
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,064
Is a Prison Planet

509
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:28,928
Understand everything here

510
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,768
This is all

511
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,328
Little bit more than just a test you see

512
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,352
What

513
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,888
He's a prison

514
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:40,192
This planet

515
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:41,984
Is purgatory

516
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,800
And if you fail probation

517
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,080
What

518
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:47,616
You cut off a god

519
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:52,736
The Gods like I'm going to give you one last chance

520
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:55,296
Body-conscious on this planet

521
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:58,880
We'll see what you accept what you what you go towards

522
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:01,952
But I'm going to warn you one more time I'm cutting you off

523
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:04,768
Regatta

524
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:07,328
That really freaked me out because

525
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:10,400
A completely shattered what I thought Alex meant by prison

526
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:11,680
Complain that this whole time

527
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:15,520
I have understood the term like the way I take most sane people

528
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:21,920
You're trapped on

529
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:24,480
Yeah I had absolutely no idea that

530
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:25,504
This is what

531
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,856
He met and now that I do I'm struggling to grasp what it means and how it impacts

532
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:30,624
His ideas

533
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,648
In his world

534
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:37,024
If what he saying here is to be believed then part of the prison planet actually involves us haven't been

535
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,096
Sentence to being here on this Prison Planet

536
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:46,752
There's something that precedes our birth that we did that was bad and required God to give us this Cosmic probation on

537
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:50,336
That's pretty f***** up and I would like to Alex to explain more about

538
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:53,920
Yeah I would need a lot more biblical

539
00:25:54,176 --> 00:26:00,320
I think I think one way to look at this has to be talked about original sin but I wouldn't

540
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:01,600
I think that's the case because

541
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:05,952
Alex wouldn't go along with the belief that all humans are inherently born

542
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:06,720
Guilty

543
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:09,280
That would fly in the face of his steadfast belief

544
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:10,304
Individualism

545
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,120
Free Will in the rejection of guilt by association

546
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:16,192
No idea what he's talking about it

547
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:16,960
Fascinating

548
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:22,336
Like if you die young does that mean you got out early for good behavior which is why Only the Good Die Young

549
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:23,360
Possibly

550
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:25,920
Who knows I mean Janis Joplin's gone

551
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:28,992
Are near-death experiences just meetings with the parole board

552
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:31,040
Like what's happening

553
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:36,928
There's so many possibilities for this imaginary friend a snitch

554
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,000
Possibly none of this makes sense

555
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:41,280
And if I had the gas

556
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:43,328
I really think it would just him freestyle

557
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,864
That's what that's how I heard

558
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:47,424
I didn't think that this is actually something he believes

559
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,704
Are you stalking

560
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,544
Penny doesn't realize the intricate nonsense that he's implying

561
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:56,128
At least that's what I thought until I heard what he said neck

562
00:26:57,408 --> 00:27:00,736
Devil worshippers are going to Andrea Victoria Morales jump

563
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:02,016
Okay

564
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:04,064
The domestic Terror

565
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:05,856
The evil one

566
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:07,904
The Badman which of course I'm not

567
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:09,696
The point your fingers

568
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,656
I got your trying to get you to

569
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:20,704
Get out of this together

570
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,008
Last year

571
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:25,056
And I know you song You Are

572
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:26,848
So you will pay

573
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,128
And not by my hand

574
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:31,968
I just want to wait from you

575
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:34,528
God has promised

576
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,344
He will separate us from you

577
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,928
Jesse's everybody exits California New York

578
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:41,696
Play the left

579
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:44,256
Imagine that spiritual energy

580
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:45,280
Alicia

581
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:46,816
Being away from them forever

582
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:47,584
Penne pasta

583
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,632
And they're gone

584
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:53,728
You have total completion total peace with God

585
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,032
Had to have the cash you had free will

586
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:57,568
You did some bad things

587
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:00,640
I fear

588
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,456
We don't know yet

589
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,160
We are

590
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:12,928
Are here

591
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:13,696
Jimmy tested

592
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:19,840
What

593
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:21,120
What is me

594
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,472
I wish

595
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:28,800
I'm telling you

596
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:34,944
A lot of trouble cuz if you think this planet is bad

597
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:36,480
I got a good look at it

598
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:40,832
Weather.com

599
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:47,232
Tomorrow's news today

600
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:49,792
And you know what I'm thinking this is

601
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:51,840
Starting to put everything together okay alright

602
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:52,608
1

603
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:53,888
All religion

604
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:56,960
Ginger Trail all real happening all the time okay

605
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:57,984
Alex

606
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,264
Is a demon

607
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,544
Who escaped

608
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,568
From hell

609
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:04,128
Only to wind up on this planet

610
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:04,896
Alright

611
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:07,456
Living is demon leeway's and all he wants

612
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:10,016
To get off this rock but he does want to go back to hell

613
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:10,784
Here we are

614
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,552
This makes

615
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:12,832
Perfect sense

616
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:19,232
I think it's interesting that he describes himself as a trustee

617
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:20,512
So f****** weird

618
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:22,048
I know know what's happening

619
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:26,144
Alex Munoz

620
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:27,424
What goddess

621
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,192
A skier

622
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:31,264
What would like why wear on a Prison Planet

623
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:35,616
Can't say it on the radio because we're not supposed to know this

624
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:39,456
Let me reinterpret that for you reality

625
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:41,760
Alex got in over his head talk

626
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:44,576
About this and bragging about how he knows Cosmic Secret

627
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:47,904
And realize like I better stop this because

628
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,952
If I say anything concrete

629
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:50,720
I can't walk

630
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:53,536
Pocketbac

631
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:58,400
Vague I can imply that I have this magical mystical knowledge

632
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:00,704
Specific people hold me to that

633
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:02,752
It's something really serious to hold you

634
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:03,776
You two that you think is is

635
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:04,544
Cosmic

636
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,568
Like

637
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:07,360
Spiritual reality

638
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:08,384
That you're aware of

639
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,408
It's not like

640
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:12,480
Something that you could I could maybe get a little bit wrong

641
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:14,272
Right pretty concrete

642
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:17,088
And you don't want to be nailed down like that cuz he was making s*** up

643
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:23,488
Yeah I'm a little bit frustrated that we can go directly from a hashtag Alex Jones was right clip to Alex

644
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:26,048
Jones claiming that he is seeing hell

645
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:28,096
And is escaping the

646
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:30,912
Purgatory of manhood by

647
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:33,216
Asking God to remove him

648
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:34,496
Trustee powers

649
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:41,408
Yeah but means well that's if he's writing about that you can give that hashtag

650
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:42,176
Haha

651
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,968
I don't know how we would ever know

652
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:45,760
That's a great thing

653
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:48,064
Completely under

654
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:54,464
Unfalsifiable it depends on whether or not we have near-death experiences

655
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:58,560
F*** you too Alice for this nonsense presentation of

656
00:30:58,816 --> 00:30:59,584
I know

657
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:05,984
I know what we did in a past life or whatever but I can't say it on the are your self

658
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:12,384
Saying that I apologize to Alex for not recognizing he's a demon who escaped from hell and is trapped in a human

659
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,152
Body on Ark

660
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:14,432
Planet

661
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:15,456
Some interesting like

662
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:17,504
Like movie and

663
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:22,368
Demon trapped Escape From Hell trapped on a prison planet of Earth

664
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:23,392
Rye Arts

665
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:28,256
Right-wing conspiracy

666
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:34,656
Yeah yeah

667
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:36,704
Got just what the f***

668
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,264
F*** get out of here believe that you would

669
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,800
Allow that to happen

670
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:42,848
And let somebody record it

671
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:45,664
Be proud of it

672
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:48,736
When are the next day

673
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:50,016
Anyway

674
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:54,624
Ocean

675
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:56,928
It really hit me in the last few weeks

676
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,280
They're just so fantastical

677
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:06,400
Ashley be living this life

678
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:09,472
Bubbles plans.

679
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:13,056
Social credit scores 20 years ago in Hollywood

680
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,224
People that eat too much fat

681
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:23,552
Will have smartphones that track what everybody does

682
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:27,648
Course you know it's a total nightmare it's on Earth

683
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:31,744
Rules

684
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:39,936
For so many angles to this there's so many angles to this

685
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:41,728
Thought about

686
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:43,264
How I'm going to cover this

687
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,800
Poorly

688
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,872
Because this is so important

689
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:51,712
And then I just get here to the point of talking about it

690
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,272
It's like such a big deal

691
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,344
Talkin about it almost lessons

692
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:04,512
This isn't just something we're talking about this about that

693
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:05,280
Mike's

694
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:07,328
We're about to have a hurricane here

695
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:11,168
It's about to be winter time

696
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:13,984
So it's about to be summertime this is

697
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:16,544
End of civilization

698
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:19,360
And they're running around

699
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:23,200
Tell people that are going to buy into it

700
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,576
Doesn't exist in the same moment as a minute and a half

701
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:29,344
Nothing

702
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,368
Killing time

703
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:33,440
Yeah but you noticed that Alex memories

704
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:37,280
Weirdo esoteric ideas

705
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:40,096
It cheapens it to even talk about it now

706
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,400
You think the afterlife would be the cheapest

707
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:48,544
This kind of same game it's usually with like I don't want to get into

708
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,568
The News-Gazette

709
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:50,336
Prepare

710
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:51,616
And people

711
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,944
Expect me to actually know the stories that I'm

712
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:55,712
Going to get into

713
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:57,504
Yeah just making

714
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:03,648
But how I've seen hell has the Hallmark of avoiding doing a book report

715
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,440
Like you know Miss

716
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:09,024
Listen I would love to

717
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,584
To tell you about the Adventures of Tom Sawyer

718
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,376
And Huckleberry so please do that

719
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:15,168
I-88

720
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:16,704
Too big of a

721
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:21,824
Honestly it did you have so much going on all of this stuff

722
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,128
This is a classic hits 100 years old

723
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:27,968
Who am I to report on a classic car

724
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:30,016
People who have done doctorate

725
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:38,464
It's interesting really when you think about it how many behaviors Alex demonstrates on arrows that are there

726
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:40,512
The children

727
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:42,560
There's a there's a lot of overlap

728
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:46,656
The news Alex talks about a meme that he saw

729
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:02,016
You give such contacts to three weeks ago

730
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:05,600
Letters to foia requests have summer systems in Europe

731
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,184
In the Netherlands where there

732
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:10,720
Bleeder their Parliament

733
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:13,024
Is getting orders from Pascua

734
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:18,912
The forward to the Dutch version of it in

735
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:31,456
Tells the leader of the government

736
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:36,576
Have you heard of the great reset

737
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:45,536
So I went to completely bungled this story and gotten all of the details wrong

738
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:52,192
He's doing this intentionally because that's the only way to get this story to fit into his predetermined narratives of class swap secretly controlling

739
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:53,472
All of the world's politician

740
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:58,080
So the first error is that this wasn't something that leaks like the beginning

741
00:35:58,336 --> 00:36:01,920
System

742
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:03,456
An MP request

743
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:05,248
Did some documents and they were provided

744
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,064
These were not secret documents they are just in

745
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,624
Invitations that were sent to various Dutch politician

746
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,184
51st World economic

747
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:13,952
Forum

748
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:17,792
Did the organization that was started by Klaus Schwab so that's how you factors into that part of

749
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:24,704
Alex's reported this as the leader of the parliament getting orders from Schwab which is a lie and the invitation

750
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:26,240
That were released didn't even

751
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:27,008
Include one

752
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:29,056
For the head of the parliament

753
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:32,128
Body of government in the Netherlands is called the House of Representatives

754
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:36,736
It'll really have so much of a parliamentary leader is they have leaders for each of the parties

755
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:38,016
That are represented Within

756
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:38,784
In the house

757
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:39,552
And there are a bunch

758
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,136
House does have a group called The presidium

759
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:44,416
Which includes the speaker

760
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:45,952
And 9 Deputy speaker

761
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:49,280
So I guess this maybe would what you'd call a house leader

762
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:51,840
Speakers currently Vera Bergkamp

763
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:53,888
Map of the Democrats 66 party

764
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,680
And she wasn't one of the recipient

765
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:56,448
Map of the invitation

766
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:57,984
And so this is a little bit

767
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:58,752
Murky

768
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,848
Invitations went to finance minister wopke

769
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,664
And the former Minister of Foreign

770
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,712
Development Sigrid kaag

771
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:09,248
This is not weird

772
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:10,272
I don't not know

773
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:13,088
Also along with these damn invitation

774
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:18,464
When's the government release some correspondences between the wi the world economic forum and Eric weebs

775
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:20,256
The minister of

776
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:22,048
Economic Affairs and climate policy

777
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,584
Regarding a letter of intent

778
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,400
Explorer Grant from the world economic Forum regarding

779
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:27,936
Creating

780
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:29,216
Food Innovation Hub

781
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:32,032
So none of this comes even close to what Alex's report

782
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:33,312
Okay so

783
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:34,336
It's a

784
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:35,616
Deadly secrets

785
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:37,920
Terrifying

786
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:40,736
Because

787
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:42,272
The finance

788
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:43,808
Person

789
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:46,880
Got it is talking to the finance body

790
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:48,160
About getting Finance

791
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:51,232
Yeah it's okay it's big

792
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:57,632
Dud the first part of the Galaxy sayings

793
00:37:57,888 --> 00:37:58,656
Context of this

794
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:02,240
So the video that Alex is covering

795
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:07,104
He's talking about was posted by a Twitter account called Ringo Lennon last July

796
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:12,992
Who's actually posted by a number of other accounts but I chose that one because their profile image is the Infowars logo

797
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:14,528
So I thought it was

798
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:15,808
I was expecting it to be the be

799
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:17,600
Alex said this happened the other day

800
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,416
That's great

801
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:24,512
It is true that this video shows a young Dutch politician named Gideon

802
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:27,072
Ameri I met her in

803
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:29,632
Prime minister mark rutte

804
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:32,448
What he thought of the book The Great reset

805
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,984
Ricky says he did

806
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,824
No the book and then Gideon produces a letter that Rudy it sent

807
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,384
Klaus Schwab thanking him for sending him the book

808
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:44,480
Gideon accuses him of lying and then the Prime Minister explained

809
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:47,808
But he doesn't have time to read every book that he gets that new was polite

810
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:49,088
Response to Schwab

811
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:54,464
Dude

812
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,512
Dude

813
00:38:56,768 --> 00:39:01,120
Interaction was super popular in the dum-dum conspiracy world back in July

814
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:03,168
And I guess Alex just saw it and thinks

815
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,448
Or

816
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:09,568
It had something to do with these misrepresented World economic Forum invitations that came out recently

817
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:11,104
Do the shity work all around

818
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,152
Just nothing

819
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:15,712
It's worse than nothing

820
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:19,040
Is a full story that's the that's the stand-up comedians

821
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:20,064
The other day

822
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:26,208
My one-year-old needs she's six now the other day whatever I wrote this joke 5 years ago

823
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:28,000
The part about

824
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:30,560
The prime minister of the Netherlands writing

825
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:32,352
The forward for the Dutch version

826
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:33,120
Of

827
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:35,680
I have no idea if that's true I don't

828
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:39,776
It's definitely not true from the video that Alex's siding

829
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:40,800
It would seem odd

830
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:41,824
Yeah it's okay

831
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:42,848
I don't know

832
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:45,152
Anyway Alex thinks he's got this scoop

833
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:47,456
The scoop about the Dutch Parliament

834
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:49,504
That happened last year

835
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,344
I picked it up yet

836
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:00,512
Heliball to death

837
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:03,840
Passionate about

838
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:14,080
Is the forest

839
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:28,416
Is too busy to be Satan

840
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:31,488
Seems I'm trying to run every aspect of your life

841
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:39,168
I think Paul probably said that I could write an article about it cuz

842
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:41,728
Probably did last July

843
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:46,336
Oh my God this is bro

844
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:47,104
Exclusive

845
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:50,176
Oh my God I'm not going to send an email back on this

846
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:56,832
Oh I forgot I've got lost in my Spanish

847
00:40:57,344 --> 00:41:01,696
Who's trying to cover this end of this the Republic news and how like

848
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:06,048
There their opposition the Democrats are

849
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:06,816
And all this

850
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:09,888
I kind of wish on it so you got try again next time

851
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,472
Try again next segment

852
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:16,032
This Is Not Mere building suspense

853
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:17,824
Who

854
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:22,688
Is the most important player with millions of a couple million

855
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:26,784
100000 person

856
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,064
Football field

857
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:29,600
Conservatively

858
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:35,232
Really

859
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:37,024
Exaggerating

860
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:42,656
Please list

861
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:44,704
Chameleon

862
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:13,631
Humongous

863
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:17,727
Choked up because the audience is so bad

864
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:20,287
Because

865
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:29,247
I don't come up with words to describe just how damn evil this is

866
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:33,855
Timor

867
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:38,975
Flight 567

868
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:44,351
I'm trying to say that the exaggerated also lies a lot

869
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:45,631
This is just more killing

870
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:47,679
Time is so stupid

871
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:49,727
That's amazing

872
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:50,495
About that audience

873
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:51,519
And I like

874
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:54,847
That is absolutely exaggerating

875
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:57,919
Play Shreya Ghoshal radio

876
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:59,455
There are millions of people listen

877
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:03,039
Including his dreaming numbers in his download

878
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:04,319
That means that he

879
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:05,599
Conservatively has

880
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:07,903
Twice the audience of Joe Rogan

881
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:12,255
Oh yeah easily I assume that Joe will be coming on Infowars

882
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:13,791
To start getting more viewers

883
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:19,423
Years ago he did cut an ad where you said that

884
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:22,239
Conservatively 10% of the world

885
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:23,263
You did say that

886
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:29,407
I'm close to his wreck his ratings

887
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:31,455
This is this is stupid

888
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:33,247
I would guess that maybe

889
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:34,783
Maybe

890
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:37,599
2 million people live with

891
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:41,183
In the range of the station

892
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:43,487
Play I was just on the radio

893
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:44,767
Maybe

894
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:46,303
It is possible

895
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:52,703
Where a lightning strike to knock out every other form of entertainment available to people within this

896
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:53,727
Radius of space

897
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:57,567
I would be surprised if any

898
00:43:57,823 --> 00:44:01,663
Fiesta Fringe radio stations carry his show anymore

899
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:05,503
Any of those stations that like maybe played him like on

900
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:07,807
Rebroadcast on The Late Shift

901
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:11,647
Make a coast to coast

902
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:13,439
I imagine those people have gotten

903
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:14,207
God

904
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:14,975
Cut cut

905
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:17,023
Chord just be so funny if like

906
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:19,583
Local NPR Chicago Philly

907
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:25,983
It just was like we're going to play an hour of Infowars everyday we just have to work tomorrow and what are we going to do

908
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:27,519
Play another all things

909
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:29,055
Is considered what are going to do

910
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:30,335
So today we're going

911
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:35,455
Switch things up on Sunday we're replacing Garrison Keillor

912
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:40,575
Gilmore Lake Wobegon

913
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:44,927
God that beautiful hair the better really strong women are above average

914
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:51,839
The better something is looking

915
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:53,119
Whatever

916
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:54,399
Yep

917
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:57,471
Alex's got a giant audience

918
00:44:57,727 --> 00:45:01,823
Some things are bad so he feels real responsibilities

919
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:03,615
Don't think that you'd actually

920
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:19,231
List of

921
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:22,815
Unquote

922
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:26,911
That there now

923
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:31,519
Noosh

924
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:36,383
Just like this

925
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:37,919
Main Street Main Street Banks

926
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:39,967
This is yet another story Alex's

927
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:44,319
Completely misreporting based on misreporting done by other sloppy blogs

928
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:47,903
This is a story that traces back to the Daily signal which you can

929
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:54,303
The media Outlet by the fact that one of their featured news categories listed on the homepage of their site is critical race

930
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:55,327
Spirit yeah

931
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:57,375
That's an indication that

932
00:45:57,631 --> 00:45:59,423
Really our reporters aren't there more of s*** hat

933
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:00,703
Yeah that that type

934
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:04,543
Type of website is like we're need to hire somebody for just

935
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:08,127
Jews segments like oh no oh boy

936
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:10,943
7 people and they critical race Theory feet

937
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:12,223
Alright whatever

938
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:18,623
Okay about so this article was published on January 11th that appear stupid written by two fellows at the Edwin meese

939
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:22,207
The third center for legal and judicial studies at the Heritage Foundation

940
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:23,487
Which means they are

941
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:24,255
Cool

942
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:30,911
They're reporting on an announcement that was made by the pretrial services agency in the District of Columbia who are going to make

943
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:33,727
Maintain records on employees exemption

944
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:34,751
To take vaccine

945
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:38,079
If you go when you read the posting in the federal registry it

946
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:41,919
It's very clear this is an administrative decision and it only applies to be

947
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:43,199
Employees of this age

948
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:47,551
They have the ability and the authority to do this and there's nothing weird about this at all

949
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:51,903
However the daily signal reports this very suspiciously

950
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:58,559
A tiny administrative agency in the District of Columbia announced a new policy Tuesday that will likely serve as a model

951
00:46:58,815 --> 00:46:59,839
For the whole of

952
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:01,119
Push to assemble

953
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:04,959
Have Americans who objected on religious grounds to a covid-19 vaccine

954
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:08,031
From there the Articles pretty dumb and boring

955
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:12,383
But using this article other Outlet start to play a little game of telephone

956
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:17,759
On the 12th of these citizen Free Press published an article with the headline quote vitamins quietly

957
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:20,319
Creating a database of the unvaccinated

958
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:23,903
Which is a mischaracterization of there already dicey source

959
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:25,439
After that Alex

960
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:30,047
Skip this and becomes mainstream news admitting the bidens creating list

961
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:31,583
Devon vaccinated people so you can come

962
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:33,375
Your house to take a shot

963
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:34,143
That sounds right

964
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:37,727
This is a pathway that b******* Alex reports typically goes

965
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:42,079
There's something that's not really that controversial that's the primary source

966
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:45,407
Which gets covered by a group of s*** had to sensationalize

967
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:51,807
And then that sensationalized article is covered by even more disreputable Outlets who slapped this on his head line on it

968
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:55,391
At which point Alex reads the headline and makes up a story about it

969
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:58,975
This is the quality of information you give someone like Alex is worth

970
00:47:59,231 --> 00:47:59,743
Is just

971
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:00,511
Sweetly meaning

972
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:03,583
I feel like the Heritage Foundation

973
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:04,863
Is the world

974
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:05,631
Largest

975
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:07,935
Per capita maniacal laughter Factory

976
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:09,471
Like after every

977
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:14,335
Evil thing they do I expect them to be like

978
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:26,879
So ask for the white people can't get Anna

979
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:28,671
Way Messier on Alex

980
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:33,279
This traces back to a video of a person going to a covid treatment

981
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:37,119
And trying to get monoclonal antibodies would being told that he apparently can't get them

982
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:39,423
But he could if you were Black Or Hispanic

983
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:45,311
The video is Shawty and it's not very clear and it's definitely missing context but that's what it appears

984
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:46,079
Michelle

985
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:47,359
I left that one important

986
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:48,127
Detail

987
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:51,967
The person in that video trying to get the antibodies as Infowars employee Harrison

988
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:53,503
Well there is that

989
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:54,527
There is

990
00:48:54,783 --> 00:49:00,927
Alex says that the mainstream media admits that white people can't get monoclonal antibodies

991
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:02,207
Video on his show the night

992
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:07,071
Before and intentionally edited out the part at the end where the healthcare workers tell Harrison

993
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:08,607
But he can't get the treatment quote

994
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:10,655
Because of a lack of underlying health

995
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:17,567
Tucker did a painfully racist segments based on his manipulated video that was produced by fours reporter

996
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:20,383
Without disclosing that he's Infowars reporter

997
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:24,223
He's just a guy man just somebody trying to do junior varsity

998
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:25,503
Project Veritas

999
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:31,903
That's f***** up it is that really need some sort of intervention if Tucker Carlson is playing an Infowars video on

1000
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:34,207
On his f****** show

1001
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:39,327
That many people to it without any Kaiser hospital where do citizen reporter

1002
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:42,399
For Infowars that's f***** up

1003
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:44,191
Weather playing the video

1004
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:48,287
Harrison of Texas or whatever their handle days

1005
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:51,615
And then his slug for like the works

1006
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:53,663
His future news. News

1007
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:59,039
Which I guess is another one of the redirect URL is that Alex has

1008
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:01,599
To Infowars or Bob and I video

1009
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:05,951
That's f***** up as anybody

1010
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:08,255
Where you got this

1011
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:09,023
Information from

1012
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:12,863
Because you know it would be suspicious

1013
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:15,679
Really really bad

1014
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:17,471
For Tucker if you was

1015
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:19,007
Strength to carry off of this

1016
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:21,055
Very racist segment

1017
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:23,615
Appointment

1018
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:26,175
Horrific

1019
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:29,247
I mean I'm sure it's pretty par for the course for Tucker play

1020
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:31,807
Man so some of the other stuff I've covered in this episode

1021
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:33,855
Is really bad work likely Dutch Parliament

1022
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:37,183
This is actively malicious

1023
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:41,023
There's no way the Tucker doesn't know that Harrison Smith works at Infowars

1024
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:42,303
There's no way whoever put

1025
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:44,095
Lease together didn't know that the nurse

1026
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:46,143
Explains why he can't get the treatment

1027
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:49,215
I decided to cut that part out so they can push the racist narrative

1028
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:53,311
Alex knows that Tucker is reporting the story based on his employees bulshit

1029
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:57,663
But still reported as the mainstream media admitting you can't get antibodies

1030
00:50:57,919 --> 00:50:58,431
If you're white

1031
00:50:58,943 --> 00:51:00,223
These are all intentional Act

1032
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:02,527
And they're designed to elicit a certain reaction in the auto

1033
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:04,063
And that reaction drift

1034
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:06,367
Pretty much all the way into white nationalism

1035
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:10,719
These people don't actually think that white people can't get monoclonal antibodies

1036
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:12,255
Pretending that they

1037
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:13,535
I do think that is

1038
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:14,815
The most effective way for them

1039
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:15,839
Past off

1040
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:18,655
Spreading the racist messages

1041
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:25,823
Hi behind like being offended if someone suggests that their race is my God

1042
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:26,847
I just

1043
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:27,615
If that's

1044
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:28,639
That's so

1045
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:29,407
F******

1046
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:31,455
I that should be on

1047
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:35,039
Every news station right like Tucker Carlson plays Infowars clip

1048
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:36,831
Just like nonstop

1049
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:39,135
Tucker Carlson

1050
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:45,535
Drive to Trojan Horse Infowars content

1051
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:46,815
Where's video

1052
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:50,143
To make his Infowars point to you

1053
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:51,423
But I mean

1054
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:53,983
How does it how can you get away with that

1055
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:59,103
Baby won't allow Alex Jones's name to be spoken in a positive way

1056
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:02,175
Yeah and like clearly

1057
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:06,527
Someone at Fox News new did absolute it in the Chiron putting

1058
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:11,391
Harrison of Texas or whatever, would have been a problem

1059
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:12,415
And that's why

1060
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:14,719
That should be that's

1061
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:15,743
That should be picked up

1062
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:18,303
That's such a f******

1063
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:20,095
Blatant example of every

1064
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:22,911
It shows a lot of intent

1065
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:23,935
I'm start a riot

1066
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:24,959
That's so bad

1067
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:25,983
So Alex

1068
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:28,287
Gets into well

1069
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:29,311
The meat

1070
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:31,615
The meat but he's been putting off okay

1071
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:34,943
Maybe you've been putting it off because his his lawyers have told him talk

1072
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:42,879
And I have had lawyers and other people

1073
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:44,159
Basically asked me not to

1074
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:46,975
And in respect

1075
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:47,999
To them

1076
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:48,767
I

1077
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:52,863
Around them so they wouldn't be involved and reverse-engineer already.

1078
00:52:58,495 --> 00:53:01,823
And I don't need to even tell you what personally happen to us because I have it all

1079
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:03,871
Right here

1080
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:06,687
Cover but this is really bad.

1081
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:08,735
This is like

1082
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:11,551
Erwin's in Northern California

1083
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:18,975
What you got about

1084
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:20,511
This is not

1085
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:23,839
I'm not happy

1086
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:26,655
And believe me I'm in this with you

1087
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:28,191
To my eyeballs I'm in this

1088
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:30,239
Debrid probably somebody out there

1089
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:36,639
But he does understand what power so this is Tyson all that as well

1090
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:40,223
So you don't like him anymore

1091
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:45,855
Beats around the bush is really bad at getting to the point

1092
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:47,391
She is

1093
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:53,791
He is done a parallel construction and figure it out that the FBI has a counterterrorism investigation

1094
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:54,559
Open

1095
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:55,327
Into him

1096
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:58,143
And the Army is involved or something

1097
00:53:58,655 --> 00:54:00,191
Okay it's it's a wide-ranging

1098
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:05,055
Conspiracy that he's got support for this evidence

1099
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:07,359
Is that some of his vendors

1100
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:08,383
I've told him

1101
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:09,663
Set the SBI is asked

1102
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:11,199
Some questions about their

1103
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:15,039
I don't know if that's true or not but Alex is a

1104
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:16,575
Extrapolated that out into

1105
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:18,879
I have a empty terrorism investigation

1106
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:22,975
There's FBI agents following me everywhere they've tapped all my phone's all this

1107
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:24,255
And I think

1108
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:25,535
Some of this

1109
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:26,559
Is

1110
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:27,839
Like I said

1111
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:28,607
Because he knows the

1112
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:32,447
I think it's some of it is.

1113
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:33,727
Prepare

1114
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:36,543
And a little bit more

1115
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:37,823
People happen

1116
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:39,615
Maybe Alex is going to be nice

1117
00:54:40,383 --> 00:54:41,151
Here's Where We Are

1118
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:46,015
Months ago the FBI

1119
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:46,783
Came

1120
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:49,599
Sam

1121
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:51,135
Montoya was out here at the office

1122
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:55,487
Bellator SWAT team

1123
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:07,263
Owen Shroyer got arrested and indicted

1124
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:13,407
About what you got indicted for

1125
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:16,223
See you at you got these did this

1126
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:17,759
So the Preamble of

1127
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:18,783
Yes

1128
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:21,599
Serramonte got in trouble because

1129
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:22,623
He videotaped

1130
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:24,927
Himself doing plugs for Infowars

1131
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:26,719
Wow breaching the capital

1132
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:29,023
Iom got in trouble because

1133
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:30,559
He had a

1134
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:31,839
Deferred judgement

1135
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:33,375
From the last time

1136
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:35,167
He got in trouble

1137
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:38,495
And I didn't do his community service violation of

1138
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:39,519
When he was at the Capitol

1139
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:42,079
This is just like

1140
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:43,871
He's trying to build this up as like

1141
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:46,431
Some kind of it they're targeting us specifically not there

1142
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:49,503
Very clear reasons why

1143
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:51,039
You have other people didn't

1144
00:55:55,903 --> 00:55:56,927
Really it's an attack on white

1145
00:55:57,183 --> 00:55:57,695
White people

1146
00:55:57,951 --> 00:56:02,047
Spectrum

1147
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:04,095
It says

1148
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:06,655
FBI counterterrorism

1149
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:13,567
The Main Tera threats

1150
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:18,687
Wrong.

1151
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:27,903
What an incredible

1152
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:34,047
I don't want to be enemies with Waze

1153
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:36,863
They are enemies of this country

1154
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:38,911
Attempt

1155
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:41,983
To format more feelings in the audience that white people are under attack

1156
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:45,055
That's about all that's going on here but some great news for Alec

1157
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:47,103
He doesn't have to worry about Andrew

1158
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:53,503
McCabe because he retired from the FBI in March 2018.

1159
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:57,087
Did I miss something that big though it's

1160
00:56:57,343 --> 00:56:58,367
Because you just

1161
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:03,487
A couple of names that he remembers

1162
00:57:03,743 --> 00:57:08,351
Christopher Ray might actually be trouble because he is still head of the FBI but like you said

1163
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:09,631
Be cool right like Trump

1164
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:10,399
Appointed him

1165
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:11,167
Neither Republican

1166
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:15,519
Cool man now he's been overtaken by the beatsteaks I get something I don't like

1167
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:20,895
Right tomorrow he's actually secretly working against the Deep state right

1168
00:57:22,431 --> 00:57:22,943
Yep it's

1169
00:57:23,455 --> 00:57:24,223
Pretty

1170
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:26,271
I mean it's cleared

1171
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:28,063
It makes total sense

1172
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:31,647
Alex's lawyers have been talkin with the January 6th

1173
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:32,415
Committee apparently

1174
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:35,743
This might be some of the stuff that Alex's lawyers didn't want to

1175
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:40,863
I'm sitting here

1176
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:47,519
They're just a sideshow for the just Apartments doing

1177
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:50,591
Telling them that

1178
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:54,943
Domestic terrorist

1179
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:58,783
Material support to terrorists

1180
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:00,063
Okay.

1181
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:04,415
Organizing

1182
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:06,207
Almost rallies around the country

1183
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:09,279
And the peaceful ones in DC that led up to January 6th

1184
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:12,095
Where is

1185
00:58:12,351 --> 00:58:13,375
As the driven snow

1186
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:14,655
When it comes to 1

1187
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:16,703
Why the hell would I want to

1188
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:25,663
January 6th committee can't charge Alex of any crime like that better be the responsibility of the Department of Justice

1189
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:26,943
Switch the committee is not

1190
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:27,967
The public face of

1191
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:29,503
Regardless of what Alex

1192
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:34,367
I suspect he thinks it is because in his ideal version of Politics on

1193
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:35,647
Summit government

1194
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:42,303
While Trump was in office Alex would have loved committees investigating Hillary's emails or Benghazi to just some Byerly arrest

1195
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:43,327
That's what he wants

1196
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:49,727
He wants that kind of abuse of power to be directed towards everyone else's bathing the same way when they're not

1197
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:54,591
This is probably what Alex's lawyers don't want to talk about

1198
00:58:55,103 --> 00:58:55,871
I like.

1199
00:58:56,127 --> 00:58:57,407
Because it's actually what the

1200
00:58:57,663 --> 00:58:59,199
The committee is saying but because

1201
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:01,247
You might be in hotter water than it seems

1202
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:06,111
So this is the date like this the David Stewart Rhodes is

1203
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:09,439
The news of his arrest broke and I want to make a bit of a retraction on some of the thing

1204
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:10,975
Things that I've said before on the show

1205
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:16,607
I've been of the opinion that Alex is kind of grandstanding about his concern about the January 6th committee

1206
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:21,983
Actually any trouble but I want to rock

1207
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:22,751
Walk that back

1208
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:28,639
I think Alex should be super scared right now but I still haven't seen any evidence that he could have beat could be arrest

1209
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:29,919
Active participation

1210
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:32,991
Hit me very clear conspiracy that Stewart in the other oath

1211
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:33,759
Keepers are charged

1212
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:35,551
It's very clear

1213
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:41,951
Conspiracy though and we know how close Alex and Stewart are and how the two of them promoted the January 6th rallies together

1214
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:43,231
Xfinity damaged

1215
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:44,767
Control together afterwards

1216
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:48,863
I don't believe that the two of them were in contact with

1217
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:50,143
Each other

1218
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:51,167
I don't believe that at all

1219
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:55,519
They just don't know the nature of that contact or any of that like how it went

1220
00:59:57,311 --> 01:00:01,663
Stuart himself was in the clear because I assumed that he would have maintained a safe distance from a

1221
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:02,943
Incriminating conversations

1222
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:04,991
That are maintained in writing

1223
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:09,087
But now that I've seen the evidence of the a diabetic I know that's not the case

1224
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:15,487
Sabertooth completely fuk you guys were doing the leaderless resistance this situation point

1225
01:00:15,743 --> 01:00:18,815
Not knowing what evidence exists

1226
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:24,191
The contacts between Alex and Stuart makes it difficult to gauge how worried Alex should be right now but on the scale

1227
01:00:24,447 --> 01:00:27,775
I think it goes from super worried to skipping the Border level worry

1228
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:29,311
Also it's

1229
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:32,895
Hard to tell but I think there's a part of me that wonders

1230
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:34,175
Like I said like

1231
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:36,479
Alex knew ahead of time

1232
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:38,015
Stewart

1233
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:38,783
Was going to get a ray

1234
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:41,599
It's felt like

1235
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:44,927
I don't know how to describe this exactly

1236
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:51,327
It didn't feel like Alex learning something on the Fly I mean but that's normal for these types of hypro

1237
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:52,095
File stuff

1238
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:53,119
Write like

1239
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:55,679
The people like Rodger Stone when he got popped

1240
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:56,447
Was like

1241
01:00:56,703 --> 01:01:00,287
He knew they were coming he didn't know the day or when but he was like

1242
01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:03,103
I know I'm going to be hit by this event

1243
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:04,895
Yeah I would say

1244
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:05,919
Vets

1245
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:08,479
In these kinds of cases there

1246
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:14,879
It's rarely a flash ring based on what I've heard

1247
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:17,183
Stewart's lawyer

1248
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:20,511
Probably some kind of an indication that they can do

1249
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:21,535
The time

1250
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:23,327
And that information could have got talent

1251
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:24,351
But like I said one of the

1252
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:25,887
The feelings that I get

1253
01:01:26,143 --> 01:01:29,215
About him knowing is I can usually blows up about Saturday

1254
01:01:29,471 --> 01:01:32,287
He can't handle like incorporating new information

1255
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:33,055
On-the-fly

1256
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:34,079
Where is this

1257
01:01:34,335 --> 01:01:35,103
How he learned

1258
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:42,527
I'm still going to Analyze This

1259
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:45,599
Even though it's looks like it's confirmed

1260
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:50,207
This is how are you

1261
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:53,535
Dealing with like one of his best friends getting arrested for

1262
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:55,327
Conspiracy to storm the capitol

1263
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:59,679
Like he's heard behind the scenes from Ali Alexander it turns out

1264
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:01,471
It's dirt roads has been arrested

1265
01:02:01,727 --> 01:02:04,543
And he's like well we got big news next kind of

1266
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:11,199
Alex does a weird how well it fits in within the theme of this

1267
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:11,967
Show

1268
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:13,503
If this doesn't feel

1269
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:14,783
Write to me

1270
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:15,807
What is a scam

1271
01:02:17,087 --> 01:02:17,855
Just doesn't

1272
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:18,623
Ikea

1273
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:23,231
I can't I can't put it any more sickly then like he loses his s***

1274
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:26,047
When there's a tech problem he storms off air

1275
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:29,119
Yeah who's the guy who's

1276
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:33,727
Who doesn't handle bad news well

1277
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:37,055
Stratosphere

1278
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:38,847
Awareness of a man's mood

1279
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:41,919
When it comes to having listen to thousand

1280
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:43,199
Thousands of hours

1281
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:44,223
You got me beat

1282
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:45,503
And if somebody came

1283
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:47,039

1284
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:49,855
I know that he's acting out of character for

1285
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:51,391

01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:53,439
Yeah it smells

1287
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:55,231
Exactly

1288
01:02:55,487 --> 01:02:57,023
If you ever get to the news right away

Where I was like nothing means anything

1311
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:27,903
Alex finally does get the go-ahead to announce

1312
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:29,183

1313
01:04:29,439 --> 01:04:30,207

It is the Patriot

1322
01:05:06,815 --> 01:05:08,095
Domestic terrorism

1323
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:08,863
Donald Trump

1324
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:12,703
Terrorism Donald Trump

Not rhyming

1327
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:19,103
Banana I don't know what's going on anymore cast of losers

1328
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:23,455
Norm pattis an ally Alexander coming out

1329
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:24,479
We don't really have any

1330
01:05:24,735 --> 01:05:26,783
Exposure to Stewart's lawyer Jonathan

1331
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:29,087
The Mosley so young who knows maybe he's a

1332
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:30,111
The great guy

1333
01:05:30,623 --> 01:05:32,415
But the other two

1334
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:33,183
Whoa

1335
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:35,743
Top luminary

1336
01:05:36,255 --> 01:05:39,583
To hear it when those are the guests that are coming up you want that

1337
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:41,119
Best-of-the-best

1338
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:42,143
And when it comes

1339
01:05:42,399 --> 01:05:44,447
To being a s*** head and being a s*** head lawyer

1340
01:05:45,215 --> 01:05:45,727
You don't get better

1341
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:49,311
I will say that I did get Alex

1342
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:50,079
Is

1343
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:51,615
Pretty good

1344
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:52,895
Coming up with a narrative

1345
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:53,663
Like that

1346
01:05:54,175 --> 01:05:54,943
So he's learned

1347
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:57,247
Rhodes has been arrested and

1348
01:05:57,759 --> 01:05:59,807
He want he gets defensive

1349
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:02,623
About other people thinking that Stuart was a

1350
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:03,391
The Fed

1351
01:06:03,647 --> 01:06:05,439
Right that was what's a lot of people have

1352
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:11,327
Only friends right with you because he hadn't been arrested arrested

1353
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:14,143
He's the one who got everybody's Alex focuses on that

1354
01:06:14,399 --> 01:06:16,191
And then comes up with another story

1355
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:25,407
Infiltrate

1356
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:28,735
Apprehensive

1357
01:06:34,111 --> 01:06:35,903
He's a distraction from real

1358
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:37,695
Interested

1359
01:06:38,975 --> 01:06:41,535
Because it came out in Congress

1360
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:44,351
Now the head of the January 6th

1361
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:45,631
Lawyer

1362
01:06:53,823 --> 01:06:55,871
The head of the gen-6 too many lawyers said

1363
01:06:56,127 --> 01:06:57,919
Amory Upson go in the building

1364
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:03,551
Unclear that up y'all don't get arrested because of

1365
01:07:03,807 --> 01:07:06,367
It was by being there you was in violation of

1366
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:07,135
For judgment

1367
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:08,671
From a previous case because I want failed

1368
01:07:08,927 --> 01:07:09,695
Community service

1369
01:07:10,463 --> 01:07:14,559
You violated an agreement that he entered into willingly to avoid consequences for his past actions

1370
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:15,839
And that's by you

1371
01:07:16,351 --> 01:07:19,679
Do your f****** community service you a****** nice

1372
01:07:20,191 --> 01:07:25,055
Conspiracy is the new preoccupation of the January 6th at the nihilist

1373
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:26,847
And essentially just boils down to this

1374
01:07:27,615 --> 01:07:30,175
EPS was at the Capitol on January 6th

1375
01:07:30,431 --> 01:07:32,735
And on the 8th the FBI released

1376
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:33,503
An image of him

1377
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:35,551
Hey somebody that they were looking for information

1378
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:41,951
Then he didn't get arrested and so the cracks Lutz and Alex's community of put two and two together to prove that he's a

1379
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:44,511
He was the one secretly running the operation

1380
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:51,167
Is it stupid and if his logic holds then I guess Jay Johnston was also there under FBI Deep Cover

1381
01:07:56,543 --> 01:07:58,591
This narrative around around this

1382
01:07:58,847 --> 01:08:03,455
Keep shifting because you're like Alex just throwing at whatever thin bulshit they can

1383
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:09,599
Sometime and create distraction from the reality that he has friends and Close Associates and follow through on

1384
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:12,159
Bringing caches of weapons to the Capitol

1385
01:08:12,415 --> 01:08:13,695
That day in

1386
01:08:13,951 --> 01:08:17,023
Explicitly premeditated plan to stop the certification of the election result

1387
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:20,095
First it was a nebula son named Aunt

1388
01:08:20,351 --> 01:08:23,679
Antifa and BLM folks who were dressed like Trump supporters I must have done

1389
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:29,823
That is clearly John Sullivan who was the ringleader in a couple more iterations of this cycle

1390
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:32,639
Andreas has a new sacrificial lamb for the right way

1391
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:33,407
Doing media

1392
01:08:33,663 --> 01:08:35,455
They're hoping it'll stick and it'll just be

1393
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:39,039
We'll figure out another guy down the road

1394
01:08:39,807 --> 01:08:40,319
Having

1395
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:43,135
Clear text messages

1396
01:08:43,391 --> 01:08:44,415
Stewart Roads like

1397
01:08:44,671 --> 01:08:45,183
Hey

1398
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:49,279
I love that you're bringing weapons to overthrow the government

1399
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:52,351
Friend we will have a quick response for so you can play

1400
01:08:52,607 --> 01:08:53,119
Create

1401
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:57,727
Overthrow the government and everybody up in a conspiracy with

1402
01:08:57,983 --> 01:09:04,127
Hey on the way to the capital from Texas I'm going to by tens of thousands of dollars worth of weapons

1403
01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:06,175
An accessory

1404
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:08,479
What is a f****** bad criminal

1405
01:09:08,735 --> 01:09:10,015
Sloppy

1406
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:11,807
Without any actual evidence

1407
01:09:12,063 --> 01:09:17,183
This guy re apps has been blamed on the capital by people like Charlie Kirk

1408
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:19,231
Marjorie Taylor Greene Matt gaetz

1409
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:22,815
Santa Cruz even got into the act after he was humiliated by Tucker

1410
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:23,583
Richarlison

1411
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:26,399
For not being aligned enough with the extremist wing

1412
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:27,167
The party

1413
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:31,263
As it turns out this is really simple an explanation for the removal of eps

1414
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:33,055
Picture from the Persons of Interest list

1415
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:36,127
Sturgis no longer had any questions they needed answers

1416
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:37,407
About from him

1417
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:40,735
Set the investigation I procrastinate got the information they needed

1418
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:46,623
There are a bunch of other examples of people whose images have been removed and not all of them were because they were arrested

1419
01:09:46,879 --> 01:09:47,903
This isn't that unique case

1420
01:09:48,671 --> 01:09:52,255
Texas absolutely he wasn't running any false flag

1421
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:57,119
He was however previously the head of the Arizona branch of The Oath Keepers

1422
01:09:57,887 --> 01:10:04,031
He was interviewed by the January 6th committee and this baby should be put to bed but it probably won't be anytime

1423
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:08,639
Because their high-profile media figures are really closely connected

1424
01:10:08,895 --> 01:10:11,455
The people who are charged with a seditious conspiracy

1425
01:10:11,711 --> 01:10:14,271
Be targeted campaigns against anyone

1426
01:10:14,527 --> 01:10:16,831
Even former leaders of Stewart's own organization

1427
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:20,671
Is it can help build a narrative where folks like Stewart now it's a really the victim

1428
01:10:20,927 --> 01:10:21,439
Gems in this whole thing

1429
01:10:22,207 --> 01:10:23,999
It's sad and honestly really dangerous

1430
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:30,655
Like I can't I can't imagine that Ray isn't feeling very safe right now has a not-insignificant number of heavily-armed

1431
01:10:30,911 --> 01:10:32,447
Lunatics think he's responsible

1432
01:10:33,471 --> 01:10:35,263
They took down the Patriot leadership ends with us

1433
01:10:35,519 --> 01:10:36,031
The country

1434
01:10:37,055 --> 01:10:37,567
Malachi

1435
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:40,639
This is probably not a great day

1436
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:41,919
I would assume.

1437
01:10:42,431 --> 01:10:43,199
But

1438
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:44,735
This is bulshit

1439
01:10:45,503 --> 01:10:47,551
Any of the way that he's being

1440
01:10:47,807 --> 01:10:48,319
Put up

1441
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:51,135
People

1442
01:10:51,391 --> 01:10:51,903
Congress

1443
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:54,975
Are trying to use this as a Smokescreen

1444
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:57,023
To excuse the behavior of

1445
01:10:57,279 --> 01:10:59,071
People who are right-wing extremist

1446
01:10:59,327 --> 01:11:00,607
On

1447
01:11:01,887 --> 01:11:03,167
He's a private citizen

1448
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:05,727
This is unacceptable

1449
01:11:05,983 --> 01:11:07,263
Well what you're forgetting

1450
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:08,031
Reading is that

1451
01:11:08,287 --> 01:11:08,799
This

1452
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:12,639
Whole thing was also funded by billionaires and their members

1453
01:11:12,895 --> 01:11:14,431
The Congress in the conspiracy as well

1454
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:17,247
I think we're going to

1455
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:22,367
To find that you can put a lot of money towards f****** up a private citizens life with no consequences for

1456
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:24,415
It's it's just

1457
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:25,183
Yep

1458
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:28,767
I mean like I never wanted to be in the position of like

1459
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:29,535
Defending

1460
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:32,863
A former oathkeeper who was apart of

1461
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:39,519
The events for this kind of behavior is is so dangerous

1462
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:41,567
It's not so much defending him as

1463
01:11:41,823 --> 01:11:46,175
Refusing to allow a scapegoat to be put in place

1464
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:47,967
You know like f***

1465
01:11:48,223 --> 01:11:49,503
Do you you don't get to get away from this

1466
01:11:50,271 --> 01:11:52,575
Even though you have several billion dollars

1467
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:54,111
Stewart's not a fed

1468
01:11:54,879 --> 01:11:57,951
I just kind of hard to believe that Steward was a fad

1469
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:02,303
Definitely has

1470
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:08,703
Got you hot

1471
01:12:08,959 --> 01:12:10,239
You want my analysis

1472
01:12:11,519 --> 01:12:12,031
That's what's going on

1473
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:15,359
This is essentially The Narrative that Alex is going to run with

1474
01:12:15,615 --> 01:12:18,175
And that is that you know Ted Cruz

1475
01:12:18,431 --> 01:12:19,711
He started questioning

1476
01:12:20,223 --> 01:12:21,247
About Ray apps

1477
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:26,623
What's going on with this guy let me keep got too hot so they had to take us to a road

1478
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:29,695
I guess I better probably plays with the audience but

1479
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:30,463
It's very stupid

1480
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:31,999
So

1481
01:12:32,255 --> 01:12:35,327
Alex makes a little bit of a tactical error

1482
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:39,935
And that is what he starts saying a bunch of things that really really make Stewart sound guilty

1483
01:12:40,191 --> 01:12:41,727
Oh that's not good

1484
01:12:42,751 --> 01:12:44,287
I interrogated Stewart on air

1485
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:46,847
Once a month ago about

1486
01:12:52,223 --> 01:12:53,247
Take show

1487
01:12:54,271 --> 01:12:55,551
Mozart

1488
01:12:55,807 --> 01:12:57,855
What 95% on Saturday

1489
01:13:03,231 --> 01:13:04,255
Guilty

1490
01:13:05,023 --> 01:13:07,327
And I was just like wow are you flipping out like

1491
01:13:08,607 --> 01:13:09,887
Probably let me see Joker

1492
01:13:15,007 --> 01:13:16,031
And he flipped out on me

1493
01:13:19,871 --> 01:13:20,895
Does persons

1494
01:13:23,455 --> 01:13:25,247
Boy I hope that's

1495
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:26,527
Subpoenaed wow

1496
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:30,111
Wow just revealing the existence of that is a smart move

1497
01:13:31,135 --> 01:13:32,415
Stewart

1498
01:13:32,927 --> 01:13:35,487
Completely freaks out on Alex but questions about the sick

1499
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:41,631
God dammit this is why the globalists are such s*** is because they're the imaginary enemies of people who are like

1500
01:13:41,887 --> 01:13:42,655
F****** stupid

1501
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:44,191
This is terrible

1502
01:13:44,447 --> 01:13:44,959
Yeah

1503
01:13:46,495 --> 01:13:47,775
Should have known better than

1504
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:49,311
To grill Stewart Road

1505
01:13:49,567 --> 01:13:50,847
Why is any

1506
01:13:51,103 --> 01:13:51,615
Call question

1507
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:58,015
To this guy after after the sixth when I asked him to wrecked pointed questions about his info

1508
01:13:58,271 --> 01:14:04,159
12 men in the sixth lie think I think that the question I've obviously

1509
01:14:04,415 --> 01:14:05,183
But I think

1510
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:07,487
Did the presentation that he's trying to make is that

1511
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:11,327
They pointed questions of the grilling we're about him being

1512
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:12,095
A fad

1513
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:14,143
But I also think that any of those questions

1514
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:15,167
Would touch on things

1515
01:14:15,423 --> 01:14:16,447
That would be really tough

1516
01:14:16,959 --> 01:14:23,103
Stewart and surprised you're not a fed well I tried to overthrow the country

1517
01:14:23,615 --> 01:14:27,199
I'm going to have to ask you about everything

1518
01:14:27,711 --> 01:14:28,223
So look

1519
01:14:29,759 --> 01:14:31,295
I can't I can't stop loving you

1520
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:34,111
Innocent it looks for you to say

1521
01:14:34,367 --> 01:14:39,999
Also I have a tape where he answered questions that makes it look very guilty that I didn't show you

1522
01:14:40,255 --> 01:14:43,583
Do you now because I don't want you to think he's guilty

1523
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:47,679
And that's why I can't show you this information

1524
01:14:47,935 --> 01:14:48,959
Probably going to like

1525
01:14:49,215 --> 01:14:55,359
This tape is he he would make it

1526
01:14:55,615 --> 01:14:56,383
Somebody else's like

1527
01:14:56,639 --> 01:15:02,783
Oh we've got a tape of Hillary Clinton looking real guilty describing how she wasn't on Epstein's Island and then she

1528
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:07,647
When we lift out

1529
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:10,463
The kick people's asses

1530
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:11,487
Yeah

1531
01:15:11,743 --> 01:15:12,255
Nothing

1532
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:14,047
I feel like Alex

1533
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:18,655
If Ever I were in trouble I would not want empathetically I would not want him to

1534
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:21,983
PR for me cuz he's going to end up accidentally or maybe even a

1535
01:15:29,407 --> 01:15:32,479
Stuff that sounds a little iffy

1536
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:38,367
Accused

1537
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:40,671
And I don't think

1538
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:45,023
Which of the Thousand members infiltrated

1539
01:15:48,351 --> 01:15:49,887
What's wrong

1540
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:57,823
What's good

1541
01:15:58,335 --> 01:15:59,103
At this point Alex

1542
01:15:59,359 --> 01:16:02,175
Should be putting the pieces together about this obvious puzzle

1543
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:09,343
He hasn't read the indictment so he hasn't seen the concrete evidence of Stewart's direct involvement with these allegedly dalu

1544
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:11,391
Delusional Oath Keepers who thought they were under the orders

1545
01:16:11,647 --> 01:16:14,719
He's still trying to spend this as best as you can

1546
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:21,119
But that part about how Stewart wasn't denouncing The Oath Keepers who went in and makes a whole lot more sense now in hindsight

1547
01:16:21,631 --> 01:16:23,935
He was hanging strong with them because he knew that they

1548
01:16:24,447 --> 01:16:28,799
Concrete dirt on him and he would get arrested for sedition

1549
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:29,567
Conspiracy

1550
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:31,103
If they put this dirt out

1551
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:33,663
He wasn't about to hang them out to dry and risk them talking

1552
01:16:34,431 --> 01:16:36,223
The stuff that Alex is saying if it's

1553
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:42,623
Incredibly perfectly with the side effects or Stewart was running a group of people who are planning to disrupt the certification of the election

1554
01:16:43,135 --> 01:16:44,927
By storming the capital if it came to that

1555
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:50,559
That's why you blew up at Alex when he was questioned about things on that show that's why you didn't turn on the arrested oath

1556
01:16:52,351 --> 01:16:54,399
Compelling circumstantial case that's

1557
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:55,935
Is guilty as hell

1558
01:16:56,703 --> 01:16:57,471
This is not good

1559
01:16:57,727 --> 01:16:58,495
You know I asked him to

1560
01:16:58,751 --> 01:17:04,895
You say there's a bad idea but he wouldn't he said that he loved it and it was a great idea and that he wished that he was the one who let it and he was the one

1561
01:17:06,943 --> 01:17:10,783
This seems really sloppy and shipped but like I still think this fits into the

1562
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:16,159
Notion that Alex knew in advance is going to have a repair is that well

1563
01:17:16,671 --> 01:17:18,207
This is still the kind of thing you'd expect

1564
01:17:18,463 --> 01:17:19,999
M22 beer a like about

1565
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:23,583
Crystal dust cover for apps

1566
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:26,655
I think he's a True Believer

1567
01:17:28,447 --> 01:17:29,727
Oh my God

1568
01:17:32,031 --> 01:17:32,543
Write-ups

1569
01:17:33,311 --> 01:17:34,591
So we should support story

1570
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:36,383
And worry about Stewart

1571
01:17:38,175 --> 01:17:39,711
Play me concerned are because

1572
01:17:41,759 --> 01:17:42,783
Very smart guy

1573
01:17:43,551 --> 01:17:45,087
Please also extreme

1574
01:17:46,367 --> 01:17:46,879
He's a real man

1575
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:50,207
A folks who don't know their new Leicester baby

1576
01:18:00,447 --> 01:18:02,239
And sacrifice yourself a romantic

1577
01:18:03,007 --> 01:18:04,543
I'm also a realist

1578
01:18:05,823 --> 01:18:07,615
In that Romance

1579
01:18:07,871 --> 01:18:09,919
Humanity

1580
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:11,199
Not let me get my

1581
01:18:11,711 --> 01:18:12,735
Play

1582
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:14,783
Warren store

1583
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:16,063
Over and over again

1584
01:18:16,831 --> 01:18:17,343
That

1585
01:18:17,855 --> 01:18:19,391
He was infiltrated years ago

1586
01:18:19,647 --> 01:18:21,439
I love the idea that Alex

1587
01:18:21,695 --> 01:18:25,535
Breakfast and I would like if there's any new listeners let me explain what romantic means

1588
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:29,631
Like this is something that we go over a lot

1589
01:18:29,887 --> 01:18:31,423
This is from our earlier at the

1590
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:34,239
Episode ardyn forwards when I explained what a romantic was

1591
01:18:34,495 --> 01:18:38,079
I don't expect new listeners to catch up so dumb man like

1592
01:18:40,383 --> 01:18:42,943
The facts of this case like as laid out in the indictment

1593
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:44,735
Possibly be a cover for re-up

1594
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:47,551
Like someone

1595
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:52,415
Existed until the right-wing social media decided to blame him recently up there's a little while back

1596
01:18:52,671 --> 01:18:53,695
He came at everyone's mind

1597
01:18:54,207 --> 01:19:00,351
I get the sense that I may be making some of the same calculations that Stewart did when did abandon the arrested okay

1598
01:19:01,375 --> 01:19:03,935
Stewart becoming on in Fort Worth since 2009

1599
01:19:04,959 --> 01:19:06,495
13 years of the two of them being a social

1600
01:19:07,007 --> 01:19:09,567
I wouldn't be too surprised if Alex didn't want to run the risk

1601
01:19:09,823 --> 01:19:10,335
Stewart talent

1602
01:19:10,591 --> 01:19:11,103
Tails about it

1603
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:17,247
Maybe about Alex's finances of the way the show runs or how little he cares about the audience of the things that he said

1604
01:19:18,015 --> 01:19:19,807
It kind of feels like there's something because

1605
01:19:20,063 --> 01:19:24,927
If you're in the clear now is exactly the right time to pretend you never met Stuart Road

1606
01:19:25,183 --> 01:19:26,975
Anybody who says that you are a

1607
01:19:27,231 --> 01:19:30,815
They're floating a raft of dirty lies around

1608
01:19:31,839 --> 01:19:33,119
The easiest thing to do right now

1609
01:19:33,375 --> 01:19:34,143
Stewardess f***

1610
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:35,679
Half of all of Alex's audio

1611
01:19:35,935 --> 01:19:37,215
It's already thinks he's a Fed

1612
01:19:37,471 --> 01:19:42,079
It is Ray Epps nonsense might be playing on the social media right now but it's not going to work for the long-term

1613
01:19:42,847 --> 01:19:44,895
Over-committing to this is a bad idea

1614
01:19:45,151 --> 01:19:46,431
Yep just saying f*** store Road

1615
01:19:46,943 --> 01:19:48,735
Fine no consequences

1616
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:49,759
It's

1617
01:19:51,039 --> 01:19:53,087
What is it when he says his lawyers say there

1618
01:19:53,343 --> 01:19:54,879
Looking into me for material support

1619
01:19:55,135 --> 01:19:55,647
For terrorism

1620
01:19:55,903 --> 01:19:56,671
It's hard not to think

1621
01:19:57,439 --> 01:19:58,207
Maybe he gave

1622
01:19:58,463 --> 01:19:58,975
Stewart's

1623
01:19:59,231 --> 01:19:59,743
Some money

1624
01:20:00,767 --> 01:20:02,047
And then we're in real trouble.

1625
01:20:02,815 --> 01:20:03,327
You know

1626
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:07,167
Even if he didn't know what it was for is Stewart took money from him

1627
01:20:07,423 --> 01:20:10,239
And then went and bought guns and put them in that cash

1628
01:20:10,495 --> 01:20:12,543
That's hard

1629
01:20:13,055 --> 01:20:13,824
Yeah

1630
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:15,872
I would wonder about that

1631
01:20:17,664 --> 01:20:21,248
I think there's an outside possibility that's correct but also I

1632
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:22,784
Would wonder

1633
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:23,808
If Alex

1634
01:20:24,064 --> 01:20:27,904
Who's giving it money money that's what I'm saying I'm saying that that's such a

1635
01:20:28,416 --> 01:20:29,696
Thing that you wouldn't even

1636
01:20:29,952 --> 01:20:30,976
You know

1637
01:20:31,232 --> 01:20:32,256
Definitely Alex

1638
01:20:32,512 --> 01:20:37,120
Allowed Stewart to have airtime to spread conspiracy theories worth money

1639
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:40,704
If it was he recruiting use it you know all of that stuff that's

1640
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:44,032
I mean knowing what we know now about Stuart sacks

1641
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:45,312
That day

1642
01:20:46,848 --> 01:20:47,872
The notion that Alex

1643
01:20:48,128 --> 01:20:49,920
Allowed him to come on air and

1644
01:20:50,176 --> 01:20:51,712
Create a false version

1645
01:20:51,968 --> 01:20:52,736
Of what happened

1646
01:20:52,992 --> 01:20:54,016
In order to

1647
01:20:54,272 --> 01:20:55,040
Yep

1648
01:20:55,552 --> 01:20:58,112
Aspersions on his own guilt

1649
01:20:59,136 --> 01:21:01,440
The standard of evidence

1650
01:21:01,696 --> 01:21:02,464
Needed for that but

1651
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:04,768
It's a conspiracy

1652
01:21:05,024 --> 01:21:07,328
He's out there

1653
01:21:07,584 --> 01:21:09,632
I'm just saying that once Stewart got really puffy

1654
01:21:09,888 --> 01:21:10,400
For this

1655
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:11,168
That's a

1656
01:21:11,424 --> 01:21:11,936
Story now

1657
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:13,728
I will I wonder

1658
01:21:13,984 --> 01:21:18,592
Kind of feels to me less like Alex is worried about criminal exposure by way of Stuart

1659
01:21:18,848 --> 01:21:20,128
I'm bored about like

1660
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:22,432
She knows a lot

1661
01:21:22,688 --> 01:21:24,480
Yeah you knows a lot about my s***

1662
01:21:25,248 --> 01:21:26,784
And then also like

1663
01:21:27,552 --> 01:21:29,088
I can't imagine

1664
01:21:29,344 --> 01:21:30,112
If your Stewart Road

1665
01:21:30,624 --> 01:21:32,672
Being like let's Loop Alex in on them

1666
01:21:34,464 --> 01:21:35,232
Rehab

1667
01:21:35,488 --> 01:21:39,840
Pisgah military unit write that we're going to have weapons caches and stuff like

1668
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:41,376
But tell the guy who

1669
01:21:41,888 --> 01:21:45,984
Keep his goddamn mouth shut about anything for Amazon are 4 hours a day

1670
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:49,568
Yeah go ahead and tell him on Tom's

1671
01:21:49,824 --> 01:21:51,360
I highly doubt that

1672
01:21:51,872 --> 01:21:52,384
Yeah

1673
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:53,152
But you know what

1674
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:55,200
Thinking back to that time there was

1675
01:21:55,456 --> 01:21:59,296
Quite a bit of chatter from him in the end it's the same stuff that it always was but like

1676
01:22:00,064 --> 01:22:00,576
Ditto

1677
01:22:00,832 --> 01:22:01,344
What

1678
01:22:01,856 --> 01:22:04,160
Who cares I think it would be we'll see what happens

1679
01:22:04,416 --> 01:22:08,000
I need to be the world's worst idea to tell a lie

1680
01:22:09,536 --> 01:22:10,816
Romantic

1681
01:22:11,584 --> 01:22:12,864
True

1682
01:22:15,424 --> 01:22:16,704
Alex Alex

1683
01:22:17,216 --> 01:22:21,056
God is my witness

1684
01:22:21,824 --> 01:22:23,360
Come on the show today

1685
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:25,920
I say I don't think so

1686
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:30,272
I'm just really worried about Stuart broad's

1687
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:32,576
Last night

1688
01:22:33,088 --> 01:22:34,368
Rose last night

1689
01:22:35,648 --> 01:22:36,416
God is my witness

1690
01:22:36,672 --> 01:22:37,696
Before God almighty

1691
01:22:41,536 --> 01:22:45,888
I wanted to love him and

1692
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:48,704
He wasn't wrong

1693
01:22:50,752 --> 01:22:53,056
What is happening

1694
01:23:03,296 --> 01:23:04,320
Okay so Alex

1695
01:23:04,576 --> 01:23:05,856
Dreams about Stewart Roads

1696
01:23:06,112 --> 01:23:09,440
The night before I start the show talk about that

1697
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:11,232
He's just I think you might be sick

1698
01:23:11,488 --> 01:23:15,328
Yeah probably I think he's a demon from Hell who's wearing the skin of a cube

1699
01:23:15,584 --> 01:23:21,216
Psychic after-the-fact weird how sexy you really good at that

1700
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:24,544
So a comes on

1701
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:27,616
And we do learn over the course of their conversation

1702
01:23:27,872 --> 01:23:28,896
But he is the one who

1703
01:23:29,152 --> 01:23:29,920
It got in touch with Alex

1704
01:23:30,176 --> 01:23:30,688
I told him about this

1705
01:23:36,832 --> 01:23:39,392
You know I wanted you to be the one that broke the news

1706
01:23:39,648 --> 01:23:41,440
One of my attorneys I have four

1707
01:23:41,696 --> 01:23:43,488
Was on the phone with Stuart Road

1708
01:23:43,744 --> 01:23:49,888
Well he was getting arrested

1709
01:23:50,144 --> 01:23:50,912
Needs to answer

1710
01:23:51,424 --> 01:23:52,192
Look up

1711
01:23:52,448 --> 01:23:53,984
Real quick that means that

1712
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:55,008
They have the same lawyer

1713
01:23:57,312 --> 01:23:59,616
Both have Jonathan Mosley as their lawyer

1714
01:24:00,896 --> 01:24:01,664
For the America

1715
01:24:02,432 --> 01:24:03,712
American

1716
01:24:05,248 --> 01:24:06,016
Innocent

1717
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:09,088
Am I question

1718
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:11,136
Is this

1719
01:24:11,648 --> 01:24:14,720
Raid from pressure on Congressional Democrats

1720
01:24:15,488 --> 01:24:17,280
To elaborate on

1721
01:24:17,536 --> 01:24:18,304
Conspiracy charge

1722
01:24:20,352 --> 01:24:21,120
Compartir

1723
01:24:21,632 --> 01:24:23,680
Every conspiratorial see dishes

1724
01:24:23,936 --> 01:24:25,216
You know a paramilitary

1725
01:24:27,264 --> 01:24:33,408
Alexandra seems to not understand that any searching the went on after or long with Stewart's arrest wasn't fishing X

1726
01:24:33,664 --> 01:24:34,176
Expedition

1727
01:24:34,432 --> 01:24:37,248
He had all the evidence is presented in the indictment

1728
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:40,064
Plenty to charge him with and arrested

1729
01:24:40,832 --> 01:24:46,976
Quick search on a raid done because what a charges Stewart is looking at is for Destruction

1730
01:24:47,232 --> 01:24:47,744
Evidence

1731
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,048
So you could have been helpful to make sure he does know the opportune

1732
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:51,840
Destroy anything else

1733
01:24:52,352 --> 01:24:54,656
I know it sucks for these guys that the fact

1734
01:24:54,912 --> 01:24:56,960
Sitter coming out in the basis for the investor

1735
01:24:57,216 --> 01:24:58,496
Allegations actually being revealed

1736
01:24:58,752 --> 01:25:03,616
What is the effect of completely deflating the fanfiction they've been selling their audience this whole time about the six

1737
01:25:03,872 --> 01:25:04,640
I know that sucks

1738
01:25:04,896 --> 01:25:07,968
That stuff and it's probably even more so for Allie considering it

1739
01:25:08,224 --> 01:25:11,040
He's deeply involved in planning the rally at the Capitol and

1740
01:25:11,552 --> 01:25:14,880
Most of the real hardcore right-wing so probably think he's a fed or

1741
01:25:15,136 --> 01:25:16,672
Snitch because he agreed to testify

1742
01:25:16,928 --> 01:25:18,720
4th January 6th

1743
01:25:19,488 --> 01:25:22,560
But the reality here is that Stuart the rest of the information that was made public

1744
01:25:22,816 --> 01:25:25,632
Because of it completely demolishes any of the nonsense arguments

1745
01:25:25,888 --> 01:25:27,424
Alex & Ally you've made about the

1746
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:29,984
Storming at the Capitol being an orchestrated false flag

1747
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:31,776
Diva Emma deep state

1748
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:33,568
Continuing to pursue

1749
01:25:33,824 --> 01:25:37,408
Conspiratorial narrative is going to force people like Alex to come up with Evermore

1750
01:25:37,664 --> 01:25:38,688
Complicated explanation

1751
01:25:38,944 --> 01:25:41,760
For the new information that comes out demonstrating that right wing

1752
01:25:42,016 --> 01:25:45,600
Extremist planned organized and carried out the events of January 6th

1753
01:25:45,856 --> 01:25:47,136
For the purposes of disrupting

1754
01:25:47,648 --> 01:25:48,160
Transfer power

1755
01:25:48,928 --> 01:25:52,256
Of course they can't really do the opposite either because that would require them admitting

1756
01:25:52,512 --> 01:25:55,328
They were either knowingly or unknowingly part of that plan

1757
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:04,800
Alex is going to soon do the move where you transitioned into a new narrative

1758
01:26:05,056 --> 01:26:06,080
He said something like

1759
01:26:06,336 --> 01:26:11,456
We know stage of the six boat move on from that because the midterms are coming up in the globalist going to steal

1760
01:26:11,712 --> 01:26:14,784
Something like that we're going to focus on something else

1761
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:19,904
Let's not relive the gate the documentary is not going to be

1762
01:26:20,672 --> 01:26:24,512
I doubt they're going to be like Hey listen we're going to have to issue Corrections on the

1763
01:26:24,768 --> 01:26:30,912
I'll tell you what we have got a laundry list

1764
01:26:31,168 --> 01:26:33,216
I've been on purpose that might conveniently just

1765
01:26:33,472 --> 01:26:36,032
Be taken off

1766
01:26:36,544 --> 01:26:37,312
Selectman Stuart

1767
01:26:42,944 --> 01:26:44,992
Shirt roads

1768
01:26:53,696 --> 01:26:56,256
Man

1769
01:26:57,536 --> 01:26:59,328
Why is the JC

1770
01:27:00,864 --> 01:27:04,448
On clearing rayence name when he's the only one on camera

1771
01:27:06,752 --> 01:27:08,032
I can sort this out for Ally

1772
01:27:08,544 --> 01:27:12,384
The reason that the January 6th committee is tweeting out that they interviewed rahab's and that he isn't

1773
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:15,712
The fact is because of you and all your s*** head friends are insisting that he is

1774
01:27:15,968 --> 01:27:17,248
How many calls January 6th

1775
01:27:18,016 --> 01:27:23,392
They're investigating the events of that day and abscess someone who was there

1776
01:27:23,648 --> 01:27:24,160
Things that night

1777
01:27:24,416 --> 01:27:28,768
The person that they thought they might want to talk to maybe it's meant formation

1778
01:27:31,328 --> 01:27:35,424
So they put out a statement that they interviewed him and that the allegations about him are true

1779
01:27:36,448 --> 01:27:39,008
This is a great example of a right-wing media rhetorical

1780
01:27:40,032 --> 01:27:43,104
The January 6th committee did this and they're being criticized for

1781
01:27:43,616 --> 01:27:46,944
Why are they so eager to clear this guy's name it's suspicious

1782
01:27:47,456 --> 01:27:51,808
However if they didn't interview apps Ally would just be saying why do they refuse to interview

1783
01:27:52,576 --> 01:27:54,624
Is that your view them and then they didn't put out of state

1784
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:57,696
Why won't they reveal what they learn to the interview

1785
01:27:57,952 --> 01:27:58,720
This must be a cover-up

1786
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:03,328
Actual interest in the things that are happening in reality

1787
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:08,192
There's a predetermined narrative have to be presented to the audience through the

1788
01:28:08,448 --> 01:28:09,728
The filter of that narrative

1789
01:28:10,496 --> 01:28:15,104
Instances like this question Allie is asking are telltale signs of people who are operating from a

1790
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:16,128
Your position

1791
01:28:16,384 --> 01:28:17,920
You should never engage with

1792
01:28:18,432 --> 01:28:21,504
You're never going to convince them of anything because they don't care about reality

1793
01:28:22,272 --> 01:28:27,904
Also without you saying about apps being the only person on camera doing anything illegal is absolutely a lie

1794
01:28:28,672 --> 01:28:33,280
There are a ton of people who were on camera assaulting police officers breaking Capital Windows another property

1795
01:28:33,536 --> 01:28:34,304
Who sang it's just a

1796
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:35,072
Webcert

1797
01:28:35,328 --> 01:28:37,888
Didn't do anything illegal on camera

1798
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:39,936
There's a 45-second video that

1799
01:28:40,192 --> 01:28:45,312
It's going that is made the rounds all over social media where he's talking to another guy the night before and he says quote

1800
01:28:45,824 --> 01:28:47,616
I don't even like to say it because I'll be arrest

1801
01:28:48,128 --> 01:28:49,920
I'll say it we need to go into the capitol

1802
01:28:50,688 --> 01:28:52,736
If Allie thinks it's illegal to say that

1803
01:28:52,992 --> 01:28:55,040
He has a poor grasp on Free Speech

1804
01:28:55,296 --> 01:28:57,344
Is universally applied

1805
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:59,136
Everyone he knows would be in jail

1806
01:28:59,904 --> 01:29:01,696
Alex would've been in jail years ago

1807
01:29:02,208 --> 01:29:02,976
The reason Alex

1808
01:29:03,232 --> 01:29:05,536
Get away with the kind of clear incitement that he does

1809
01:29:05,792 --> 01:29:09,376
Is because Free Speech rules in this country are super permissive by Design

1810
01:29:09,888 --> 01:29:10,656
And nothing that apps

1811
01:29:10,912 --> 01:29:12,704
Day-to-night video is illegal at all

1812
01:29:13,728 --> 01:29:17,568
Dumb and it's an indication that he's probably should head but if Allie thinks it's proof of a crime

1813
01:29:17,824 --> 01:29:19,872
He needs to go take a high-school level Civic

1814
01:29:20,128 --> 01:29:20,640
6 class

1815
01:29:21,152 --> 01:29:24,224
Is that prediction after he reads the indict

1816
01:29:25,504 --> 01:29:26,016
Stewart's

1817
01:29:26,272 --> 01:29:32,416
I don't really care because I know he's never going to read it they just going to keep pretending that there's no

1818
01:29:32,672 --> 01:29:34,720
Evidence against Dorney got jammed up a cover-up wrap

1819
01:29:35,232 --> 01:29:35,744
It's all

1820
01:29:36,256 --> 01:29:37,024
Bulshit

1821
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:39,840
Ali Ali has been on

1822
01:29:40,096 --> 01:29:41,888
Alex gets

1823
01:29:42,144 --> 01:29:42,912
Jonathan Moseley

1824
01:29:43,168 --> 01:29:43,936
Stewart's lawyer

1825
01:29:44,704 --> 01:29:46,240
Play Ali's lawyer as well

1826
01:29:46,496 --> 01:29:47,776
On

1827
01:29:48,544 --> 01:29:50,592
I don't know if he understands Free Speech either

1828
01:29:51,104 --> 01:29:54,688
I'm going to ask the question again why isn't Ray ABS arrest

1829
01:29:58,272 --> 01:29:59,552
There's no good reason for it

1830
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:02,368
Even if

1831
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:11,072
Wondered

1832
01:30:12,608 --> 01:30:13,376
He still on

1833
01:30:13,888 --> 01:30:14,912
Challenge

1834
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:19,264
So there's no there's no one else who would be

1835
01:30:19,776 --> 01:30:22,080
Conspiracy but him

1836
01:30:23,104 --> 01:30:24,384
Show

1837
01:30:26,432 --> 01:30:28,224
No one else

1838
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:31,040
Innocent explanation

1839
01:30:31,808 --> 01:30:34,112
I don't wish anybody to get arrested

1840
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:38,464
The government's Behavior it just stinks

1841
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,280
It doesn't stink to high heaven

1842
01:30:41,536 --> 01:30:43,072
Nothing

1843
01:30:43,328 --> 01:30:45,120
Illegal

1844
01:30:45,376 --> 01:30:48,448
If none of it is proof that he is a leader of a seditious conspiracy

1845
01:30:48,704 --> 01:30:49,216
But

1846
01:30:49,728 --> 01:30:54,336
Be taken by Stuart as illustrated by the evidence

1847
01:30:54,848 --> 01:30:55,616
Show

1848
01:30:58,176 --> 01:31:01,248
I just can't think of anybody else who could have let any sort of conspiracy

1849
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:02,272
Beyond

1850
01:31:02,528 --> 01:31:04,320
This person who the right-wing has just

1851
01:31:04,576 --> 01:31:05,600
Decided is a great path

1852
01:31:06,368 --> 01:31:07,136
It's crazy

1853
01:31:07,392 --> 01:31:08,160
I mean it

1854
01:31:08,416 --> 01:31:11,744
The coming for this lawyer to be

1855
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,792
Sing like this to need some sort of

1856
01:31:14,048 --> 01:31:15,328
Massive kashuv

1857
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:16,864
Text messages or evidence

1858
01:31:17,376 --> 01:31:19,424
In order for me to believe that somebody else

1859
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:20,192
Could have led

1860
01:31:21,984 --> 01:31:22,496
Please client

1861
01:31:22,752 --> 01:31:23,264
For the

1862
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:28,640
Incredibly talented Jonathan Muslim maybe something was like 48 pages long

1863
01:31:30,688 --> 01:31:32,480
This lawyer I got

1864
01:31:32,736 --> 01:31:38,624
Alex says he gets bad vibes from the globalist till I get bad vibes from this dude

1865
01:31:39,648 --> 01:31:40,672
I don't care

1866
01:31:40,928 --> 01:31:42,720
As most of his defense is just like

1867
01:31:43,232 --> 01:31:49,120
Everything is a lie I didn't do it

1868
01:31:49,376 --> 01:31:51,168
It's just empty Proclamation

1869
01:31:51,424 --> 01:31:55,776
Everything is a lie and I can prove it and then no proof at all

1870
01:31:57,056 --> 01:31:57,824
If so

1871
01:31:58,336 --> 01:32:01,152
I'm not going to spend much time talking about him actually

1872
01:32:01,408 --> 01:32:02,176
Short and boring

1873
01:32:02,688 --> 01:32:04,992
But we we do we do have to record

1874
01:32:05,248 --> 01:32:06,016
Ignite something

1875
01:32:07,296 --> 01:32:09,088
I don't think anybody can deny

1876
01:32:09,856 --> 01:32:13,696
Did Biden in the great reset in the covid BS and all of this is

1877
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:19,328
Funny my God Joe Rogan's up was a Mainline liberal the system got so bad he woke up

1878
01:32:19,584 --> 01:32:20,864
Burleson

1879
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:22,144
Play Joe Rogan

1880
01:32:24,704 --> 01:32:26,496
Join everybody else just wants

1881
01:32:26,752 --> 01:32:28,288
Future for our children

1882
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:30,080
I think you could make

1883
01:32:30,336 --> 01:32:32,384
Something of an argument The Joe Rogan

1884
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:35,968
Headache sort of democrat Vibe earlier in his career

1885
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:37,504
You know I think you probably could

1886
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:38,272
Baby

1887
01:32:38,528 --> 01:32:40,576
He was a Mainline Democrat who

1888
01:32:41,088 --> 01:32:42,880
Took copious amounts of drugs

1889
01:32:45,696 --> 01:32:46,208
Tucker

1890
01:32:49,536 --> 01:32:51,072
National piece of s*** right wing

1891
01:32:53,632 --> 01:32:54,144
Was on

1892
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:57,472
Hardball as the Republican as a Republican

1893
01:32:58,496 --> 01:33:00,800
Who wore a bow tie he was on Hardball

1894
01:33:01,056 --> 01:33:02,592
As William F Buckley

1895
01:33:02,848 --> 01:33:04,384
Play Juniors f****** Minimates

1896
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:05,920
Hehehe

1897
01:33:06,176 --> 01:33:11,552
The staunchly defended the Bush Administration

1898
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:14,624
I think it's fun

1899
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:15,392
To say like

1900
01:33:15,648 --> 01:33:19,488
Tucker was just a regular liberal and then he got brought over

1901
01:33:20,256 --> 01:33:22,816
I think I was actually can defend that in his mind

1902
01:33:23,072 --> 01:33:28,704
Because he thinks that neocon deliver right

1903
01:33:29,216 --> 01:33:32,800
Total hardship everybody who didn't try and overthrow the capital is a liberal

1904
01:33:34,592 --> 01:33:36,896
Well I mean to him based on his

1905
01:33:37,152 --> 01:33:38,944
I'm right wing

1906
01:33:39,968 --> 01:33:42,528
Everybody's to the left of him relative to him

1907
01:33:42,784 --> 01:33:44,320
Tucker even in like

1908
01:33:44,576 --> 01:33:45,856
2000

1909
01:33:46,368 --> 01:33:49,696
Was a liberal apparently argue now

1910
01:33:51,232 --> 01:33:52,512
I know they're pretty similar.

1911
01:33:53,024 --> 01:33:55,584
Norm comes in

1912
01:33:56,352 --> 01:33:59,168
Nicholas time I saw him he had a gigantic ridiculous beard

1913
01:33:59,424 --> 01:34:00,192
But he shaved

1914
01:34:00,448 --> 01:34:01,984
Fall

1915
01:34:04,288 --> 01:34:05,568
He's getting angry

1916
01:34:06,336 --> 01:34:10,944
I think that there is a stand-up careers going on well end

1917
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:12,224
Twist with Norm

1918
01:34:12,736 --> 01:34:13,760
That I find upsetting

1919
01:34:14,016 --> 01:34:15,808
That is every time I hear him he's angrier

1920
01:34:16,576 --> 01:34:20,160
I watched last night for the first time Merrick Garland speech about January

1921
01:34:27,584 --> 01:34:28,352
Loaded up or down on them

1922
01:34:28,608 --> 01:34:31,680
But when I watched him quaking in his loafers in Rage

1923
01:34:31,936 --> 01:34:36,544
I thought there's something wrong with the man and there's something wrong with the country.

1924
01:34:37,056 --> 01:34:38,848
But here's what he said

1925
01:34:39,104 --> 01:34:40,384
What he said about

1926
01:34:40,896 --> 01:34:45,248
What he said about the knowingly or unknowingly

1927
01:34:45,504 --> 01:34:46,272
Two events

1928
01:34:47,552 --> 01:34:48,832
You are a co-conspirator

1929
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:54,720
You are not a co-conspirator in a crime unless you engaged

1930
01:34:54,976 --> 01:34:56,512
Self-consciously deliberately

1931
01:34:57,024 --> 01:34:59,328
For unlawful Purpose with another

1932
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:02,912
The mat Garland didn't say the five officers died on January 6th

1933
01:35:03,168 --> 01:35:08,800
He said quote five officers who responded selflessly to the attack on January 6th and since lost their lives

1934
01:35:09,568 --> 01:35:13,152
I was lying about what Garland in order to be able to call him a liar

1935
01:35:13,664 --> 01:35:15,712
Norm isn't really doing much better

1936
01:35:15,968 --> 01:35:17,504
Merrick Garland said nothing even

1937
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:21,344
Close to what Norma's claiming in the speech that Norma's claiming to a watch

1938
01:35:21,856 --> 01:35:24,928
This is just a made-up characterization of Garland

1939
01:35:25,184 --> 01:35:26,720
Is quaking in his loafers and rage

1940
01:35:27,232 --> 01:35:28,256
I can't find another

1941
01:35:28,512 --> 01:35:31,072
Instance of Garland saying that like in another speech

1942
01:35:31,328 --> 01:35:33,888
Has a citation go for it but

1943
01:35:34,144 --> 01:35:37,472
Norm if you wants to clarify where this came from

1944
01:35:37,728 --> 01:35:40,032
I'm not going to try and hook this down

1945
01:35:40,544 --> 01:35:41,312
Read the transcript

1946
01:35:41,568 --> 01:35:44,384
Does the speech that he's referring to the dorms referring to

1947
01:35:45,408 --> 01:35:46,944
Is it making s*** up to be mad about

1948
01:35:47,712 --> 01:35:49,504
Stupid all I needed to hear from him

1949
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:50,272
Is that

1950
01:35:50,784 --> 01:35:54,368
Casual nonchalant the January 5th or 6 I don't remember what

1951
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:55,648
F*** you

1952
01:35:55,904 --> 01:36:00,000
You remember God damn well when was the speech

1953
01:36:00,256 --> 01:36:01,280
Twas the Night

1954
01:36:01,536 --> 01:36:03,840
Before I try right that's what he's referring

1955
01:36:06,912 --> 01:36:08,192
I think Norm

1956
01:36:09,216 --> 01:36:10,496
Might have enjoyed the

1957
01:36:12,032 --> 01:36:12,800
I think

1958
01:36:14,592 --> 01:36:16,640
The great lie on the American people

1959
01:36:16,896 --> 01:36:19,968
I mean for Kamala Harris to stand up in front of the nation and say

1960
01:36:20,224 --> 01:36:22,272
January 6th was like setup

1961
01:36:22,528 --> 01:36:23,296
September 11th

1962
01:36:23,552 --> 01:36:24,064
Lake Pearl Harbor

1963
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:25,088
No it wasn't

1964
01:36:25,344 --> 01:36:26,880
January 6th was like 70

1965
01:36:27,136 --> 01:36:28,672
76

1966
01:36:29,184 --> 01:36:29,696
It was like

1967
01:36:29,952 --> 01:36:32,256
Concord

1968
01:36:32,512 --> 01:36:34,048
When the people wake up

1969
01:36:34,304 --> 01:36:37,632
And think enough to appear in a public place and demand answers

1970
01:36:39,424 --> 01:36:40,704
Investigating

1971
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:49,408
But they're going to get weapons caches in the Triad

1972
01:36:49,664 --> 01:36:54,016
Storm the Capitol in order to stop the the counting of the votes in the Electoral College

1973
01:36:54,528 --> 01:36:55,040
You know what

1974
01:36:55,296 --> 01:36:56,832
Congress should really look in the mirror

1975
01:36:57,856 --> 01:36:58,368
Yep

1976
01:36:59,648 --> 01:37:04,256
But I need to make some changes but that's a ridiculous thing to say

1977
01:37:04,512 --> 01:37:08,096
I know that nobody in our Far Right Movement

1978
01:37:08,352 --> 01:37:14,496
Would do this it's got to be antifa who was leading it who is instigating it now obviously in reference

1979
01:37:15,008 --> 01:37:21,152
I view it exactly the same as the American Revolution notoriously peacefulness

1980
01:37:21,408 --> 01:37:24,224
American Revolution

1981
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:27,040
Ed Concord

1982
01:37:28,064 --> 01:37:29,856
I think one of the problems

1983
01:37:30,112 --> 01:37:31,136
With this

1984
01:37:31,648 --> 01:37:34,976
Show and the community around it is like

1985
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,048
Event like they can't even get their stories

1986
01:37:38,304 --> 01:37:41,120
Alex probably wouldn't want him saying something like

1987
01:37:41,376 --> 01:37:47,520
Easiest kind of complicated to to work in with the other stuff

1988
01:37:47,776 --> 01:37:50,080
He was hoping for Wrightwood

1989
01:37:50,592 --> 01:37:52,384
Begin a revolution

1990
01:37:52,896 --> 01:37:53,920
Bitter lawyer

1991
01:37:54,176 --> 01:37:55,200
Yeah

1992
01:37:56,224 --> 01:37:59,040
Interesting Lee if you pull up the indictment

1993
01:37:59,296 --> 01:38:00,064
Boat store roads

1994
01:38:00,576 --> 01:38:02,624
One of the things one of the messages he sent

1995
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:03,392
On the set

1996
01:38:03,904 --> 01:38:05,184
As things are growing down

1997
01:38:05,696 --> 01:38:06,464
East Side quote

1998
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:08,000
Hey the founding generation

1999
01:38:08,256 --> 01:38:10,048
Storm the governor's mansion in Massachusetts

2000
01:38:10,304 --> 01:38:11,328
Sontaran feathered is tax

2001
01:38:11,584 --> 01:38:12,096
Collectors

2002
01:38:12,352 --> 01:38:13,888
The Macy's inductee in the water

2003
01:38:14,144 --> 01:38:15,936
Didn't fire on them but they street fight

2004
01:38:16,192 --> 01:38:17,216
That's where we are now

2005
01:38:17,472 --> 01:38:19,008
Next comes our Lexington

2006
01:38:19,264 --> 01:38:20,032
It's coming

2007
01:38:20,288 --> 01:38:22,848
It seems like normal

2008
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:26,432
Pretty close in spirit

2009
01:38:26,688 --> 01:38:27,968
Real guilty

2010
01:38:28,224 --> 01:38:30,016
F****** guilty

2011
01:38:30,272 --> 01:38:30,784
What am I

2012
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:31,808
Lying to our f******

2013
01:38:32,064 --> 01:38:33,088
Faces so I think

2014
01:38:35,392 --> 01:38:38,720
Even Norma smart enough to recognize that there is a threat

2015
01:38:39,232 --> 01:38:39,744
2

2016
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:41,024
His clients

2017
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:43,072
Ability to operate

2018
01:38:43,328 --> 01:38:44,096
There is

2019
01:38:44,352 --> 01:38:45,120
There is a

2020
01:38:45,376 --> 01:38:47,680
A threat that the world will start looking at

2021
01:38:48,192 --> 01:38:49,216
People like Alex people like

2022
01:38:49,472 --> 01:38:51,008
Mike Stewart

2023
01:38:52,032 --> 01:38:54,080
As opposed to like I let him be

2024
01:38:55,872 --> 01:38:57,920
Recognize the danger that looks like this present

2025
01:38:58,432 --> 01:39:01,248
And used to be more of a headache to engage

2026
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:05,088
Then not to-night now it's starting to look like we better engage before Epic

2027
01:39:05,344 --> 01:39:06,112
Becomes too big of a headache

2028
01:39:06,368 --> 01:39:07,136
Exactly

2029
01:39:09,184 --> 01:39:10,976
In order to insert a disc

2030
01:39:11,232 --> 01:39:12,000
Deflect from that

2031
01:39:12,512 --> 01:39:14,560
He has to mischaracterize

2032
01:39:14,816 --> 01:39:17,376
Why Stuart got arrested

2033
01:39:17,632 --> 01:39:21,728
Criminalize ordinary behavior in it

2034
01:39:21,984 --> 01:39:26,336
Watertown the conspiracy requirement to almost meaningless dimensions

2035
01:39:26,848 --> 01:39:29,664
If if in fact a green to go to a protest

2036
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:32,224
I'm in agreeing to stand outside doing

2037
01:39:32,736 --> 01:39:33,504
Try to try to delay

2038
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:35,552
Congress for doing something your

2039
01:39:35,808 --> 01:39:37,088
A federal agency from doing something

2040
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:39,136
We're trying to hinder them from doing something

2041
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:41,696
Expression of protest is now

2042
01:39:41,952 --> 01:39:43,232
The considered under dispatch

2043
01:39:43,488 --> 01:39:44,768
President seditious conspiracy

2044
01:39:45,024 --> 01:39:50,144
You notice how the people who were just standing outside and protesting like all those

2045
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:51,936
Hundreds and thousands

2046
01:39:52,192 --> 01:39:52,704
Message first edition

2047
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:54,496
Conspiracy

2048
01:39:54,752 --> 01:39:55,264
It's interesting

2049
01:39:55,520 --> 01:40:00,128
Weirdo Norma's completely ignoring all the parts in the indictment where Stewart is Buddy's make weapon

2050
01:40:00,384 --> 01:40:00,896
Fascism

2051
01:40:01,152 --> 01:40:02,432
Start up quick response teams

2052
01:40:02,688 --> 01:40:03,200
To bring guns to

2053
01:40:03,456 --> 01:40:03,968
The capital

2054
01:40:04,224 --> 01:40:06,016
So weird that they're pretending that Stewart didn't

2055
01:40:06,272 --> 01:40:08,064
Discuss how he and others might have to quote

2056
01:40:08,576 --> 01:40:10,880
Takes two arms in defense of our god-given Liberty

2057
01:40:11,648 --> 01:40:14,464
So weird that it doesn't come up there the person with Road

2058
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:18,048
Message their group chat during the storming of the capital and said quote

2059
01:40:18,304 --> 01:40:19,072
We are acting

2060
01:40:19,328 --> 01:40:21,376
Like the founding fathers can't stand down

2061
01:40:21,888 --> 01:40:22,400
Bruce Stewart

2062
01:40:22,656 --> 01:40:23,424
And I agree

2063
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:27,520
This is just such b******* of a move for Norm to get on the show a

2064
01:40:27,776 --> 01:40:28,800
Pretend that all Stewart dated

2065
01:40:29,056 --> 01:40:30,592
To get in trouble with go to a protest with

2066
01:40:30,848 --> 01:40:31,872
Some friends that end up getting up

2067
01:40:33,664 --> 01:40:36,480
Cowardly in a deceitful way to present this information

2068
01:40:36,736 --> 01:40:37,760
Annie knows what he's doing

2069
01:40:38,272 --> 01:40:43,904
Yuba City lawyer but yeah that should be level of

2070
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:48,768
B******* right there

2071
01:40:49,024 --> 01:40:55,168
Chris already totally 100% billion dollars Alex no please

2072
01:40:55,424 --> 01:40:57,216
But this this is

2073
01:40:57,728 --> 01:40:59,264
He's you know he's ready and I

2074
01:41:01,568 --> 01:41:02,336
Clear about this

2075
01:41:02,592 --> 01:41:03,360
You know

2076
01:41:03,616 --> 01:41:04,640
What he is doing

2077
01:41:04,896 --> 01:41:05,664
Is lying

2078
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:06,432
On air

2079
01:41:06,688 --> 01:41:07,712
He is not

2080
01:41:07,968 --> 01:41:08,736
Not lying

2081
01:41:08,992 --> 01:41:09,504
No

2082
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:10,272
No

2083
01:41:10,528 --> 01:41:12,576
There's no way you can tell me

2084
01:41:12,832 --> 01:41:17,184
But you think he made a mistake or left it out on Max I don't believe that

2085
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:20,000
You know he's a lying person who went on the

2086
01:41:20,256 --> 01:41:20,768
Airwaves

2087
01:41:21,024 --> 01:41:24,608
Specifically intentionally don't let it be a lawyer anymore

2088
01:41:25,376 --> 01:41:28,448
To look at this is the end of protest

2089
01:41:29,216 --> 01:41:30,496
Now protesting is going to be League

2090
01:41:30,752 --> 01:41:32,288
That's untrue Alex thinks

2091
01:41:32,544 --> 01:41:33,056
Something a little bit

2092
01:41:34,592 --> 01:41:36,128
They have been making

2093
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:39,712
Yeah well

2094
01:41:39,968 --> 01:41:41,248
Basically they're they're hiding

2095
01:41:41,504 --> 01:41:47,648
Needle in a haystack

2096
01:41:47,904 --> 01:41:49,696
Elevation of

2097
01:41:50,208 --> 01:41:52,256
In solitary confinement at disappearing

2098
01:41:52,512 --> 01:41:55,840
Block lawyers

2099
01:41:56,096 --> 01:41:58,400
Martial law

2100
01:41:58,656 --> 01:42:00,704
So I guess covid not going to kill us all again

2101
01:42:01,216 --> 01:42:04,288
They're going back and forth, zigzagging throughout this episode

2102
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:07,872
I guess it's back to martial law because that's more relevant to the

2103
01:42:08,128 --> 01:42:08,896
Store Road stock

2104
01:42:09,152 --> 01:42:10,176
I hate it whenever he has

2105
01:42:10,688 --> 01:42:11,712
This kind of Gaston cuz

2106
01:42:11,968 --> 01:42:15,040
Cuz he just wanted to it just sounds like they're two dudes getting drunk at a bar

2107
01:42:15,296 --> 01:42:16,064
Talking about politics

2108
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:17,344
I don't know anything about

2109
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:19,392
Sure like also

2110
01:42:19,904 --> 01:42:20,928
Bold

2111
01:42:21,184 --> 01:42:23,744
To complain about not producing documents

2112
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:30,144
The Alex Jones Show

2113
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:35,520
Discovery in the stacks I couldn't find it might have been a legitimate argument

2114
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:41,408
These five are through all of them

2115
01:42:42,176 --> 01:42:42,688
Look

2116
01:42:42,944 --> 01:42:46,528
I wanted to print out the documents to give you but I ran out of toner

2117
01:42:47,808 --> 01:42:48,576
Too many stacks

2118
01:42:48,832 --> 01:42:49,600
Edit toners

2119
01:42:50,368 --> 01:42:52,672
Yeah you're just a clip of a door being a dumb dumb

2120
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:55,232
Well I mean I tighten the narrative now is

2121
01:42:55,488 --> 01:42:57,536
The following if you complain about something and you happen

2122
01:42:57,792 --> 01:42:59,840
Baby why your why didn't your a white nationalist

2123
01:43:00,352 --> 01:43:01,888
More your white supremacist

2124
01:43:02,144 --> 01:43:08,288
I'm not sure I have the governor

2125
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:10,592
Dwight's

2126
01:43:10,848 --> 01:43:12,128
I think

2127
01:43:12,384 --> 01:43:14,176
I think if you say

2128
01:43:14,432 --> 01:43:15,968
Bad if you complain

2129
01:43:16,224 --> 01:43:17,504
You're a white nationalist

2130
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:18,272
They call you right now

2131
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:25,184
I would I would say that to say that I think is very overlapping with white nationalist

2132
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:26,976
Go so far as to say if you were

2133
01:43:27,232 --> 01:43:27,744
Justin Missy

2134
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:29,792
Synthrapol wasn't a racist you would have said

2135
01:43:30,048 --> 01:43:30,816
I'm a misanthrope

2136
01:43:31,072 --> 01:43:32,096
Instead of

2137
01:43:32,352 --> 01:43:32,864
Misanthrope

2138
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:37,984
I figured you'd be misanthropic towards Alex

2139
01:43:38,240 --> 01:43:44,384
You're missing your misanthropy is directed and in certain ways

2140
01:43:44,896 --> 01:43:45,920
All you're trying to give up

2141
01:43:46,432 --> 01:43:50,272
Eli what you actually believe all you do know they do this every

2142
01:43:50,528 --> 01:43:51,552
Every time you go out

2143
01:43:51,808 --> 01:43:52,576
You complain about 1

2144
01:43:52,832 --> 01:43:58,976
Specific race doing one thing that maybe isn't even true and they all call you a white nationalist now also

2145
01:43:59,232 --> 01:44:02,560
Forget what Norm stand-up B was

2146
01:44:02,816 --> 01:44:05,632
Insurance all my God

2147
01:44:05,888 --> 01:44:07,424
I got a dork

2148
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:11,008
We went last clip and it's Alex

2149
01:44:11,776 --> 01:44:12,544
For what concerns

2150
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:14,848
It's a bummer

2151
01:44:15,872 --> 01:44:17,664
Bone broth discounted

2152
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:19,456
It's all there in Foursquare.

2153
01:44:22,016 --> 01:44:24,832
The leaves fall off and on about some nice exercise now

2154
01:44:25,344 --> 01:44:28,160
I love this Krewella we been in the same building 15 years

2155
01:44:28,416 --> 01:44:29,696
I've been on here 28 years but

2156
01:44:30,208 --> 01:44:32,000
Can you guys decide not to support us

2157
01:44:32,512 --> 01:44:34,560
And you've already done so much that's what God wants

2158
01:44:35,328 --> 01:44:35,840
Play happier

2159
01:44:45,056 --> 01:44:45,824
Wow joke

2160
01:44:46,592 --> 01:44:47,872
We've done our best here

2161
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:51,712
And a good news here is my best work was done 20 years ago

2162
01:44:51,968 --> 01:44:52,736
Or 5 years ago

2163
01:45:03,488 --> 01:45:04,768
So people would know what was coming

2164
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:05,792
So

2165
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:08,352
I want you to keep us in the game but it's up to you

2166
01:45:08,608 --> 01:45:11,680
You want to see the game go to enforce where I time the products you needed

2167
01:45:13,472 --> 01:45:13,984
Kill me

2168
01:45:15,008 --> 01:45:16,032
Never see me again

2169
01:45:18,336 --> 01:45:19,104
Listen

2170
01:45:19,616 --> 01:45:20,128
I get it

2171
01:45:20,384 --> 01:45:24,480
Maybe you guys don't like Lucky Charms anymore do you want this leprechaun to go away

2172
01:45:24,736 --> 01:45:25,248
That's fine

2173
01:45:25,504 --> 01:45:28,064
If you don't want to support lucky f****** charms

2174
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:30,112

Mystic cleats you don't like f****** clean house anymore fine mr. clean's go away

2179
01:45:50,336 --> 01:45:53,920
I was thinking about some of the aspects of that

2180
01:45:54,944 --> 01:45:55,968
I mean I think he was bad

2181
01:45:56,992 --> 01:46:01,088
Consistently but he was better five years ago than he has now

2182
01:46:01,344 --> 01:46:03,904

01:46:06,464 --> 01:46:07,488
Sure this is worse

2186
01:46:07,744 --> 01:46:11,328
I also do grieve it to his earlier career has

2187
01:46:11,584 --> 01:46:12,608
Made the present

2188
01:46:12,864 --> 01:46:15,680
Worse he did do his work earlier

2189
01:46:17,984 --> 01:46:18,752

That makes me sad

2195
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:30,784
It feels like

2196
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:32,320

Layers

There's denial we're winning

2209
01:47:16,096 --> 01:47:18,144
We're waiting

2210
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:20,448
Right there's depression certainly

2211
01:47:20,704 --> 01:47:26,848
That's where we are now

2212
01:47:27,104 --> 01:47:27,616

Little button on this Alex was that surprised by the news

2220
01:47:50,912 --> 01:47:52,448
Store getting arrested

2221
01:47:52,704 --> 01:47:53,216
Don't know how much

2222
01:47:53,472 --> 01:47:57,056
Awareness he had of the specific of him getting arrested that day

2223
01:47:57,824 --> 01:47:58,848
But the way you reacted

2224
01:47:59,104 --> 01:48:00,384
Is not how we normally react

2225
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:01,408
Text to stop

2226
01:48:01,664 --> 01:48:03,968
It seems very very bizarre and out of character

2227
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:07,552
I don't know

2228
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:14,464
I don't know I wouldn't say that he knew was going to happen that day but if he didn't get a text like in the past 2 or 3 days

2229
01:48:14,720 --> 01:48:18,048
If it's like it could happen any week now or something like that

2230
01:48:18,304 --> 01:48:21,120
Exactly I'm definitely absolutely C

2234
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:30,848
We'll see we'll see what happens

2235
01:48:31,104 --> 01:48:33,664
Alex realizes more and more than his body

2236
01:48:35,968 --> 01:48:36,736
Straight up

01:48:50,304 --> 01:48:53,120
