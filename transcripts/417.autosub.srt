Collegeboard.com

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for knowledge but I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guy

3
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:39,936
Need

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:58,880
Dot-com I love you

5
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,536
Little bit about Alex Jones

6
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:06,304
Indeed we are.

7
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,840
Jordan Jordan

8
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:08,608
Whatsyourprice

9
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:09,376
You go first

10
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:11,936
I go first

11
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,080
I assume this has nothing to do with WrestleMania so I will say

12
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:24,480
That my bracelet as we were on this week's episode of opening arguments

13
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:30,880
Thomas over there real appreciate to have a conversation

14
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:33,952
Illegal podcast

15
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:41,888
Ton of legal questions I have about Alex blanketly like

16
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:48,288
You can get away with saying at unshit yeah it seems like my main conclusion for being on a log podcast was

17
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,568
Everything Alex Don't Shoot Me

18
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:51,616
And yet somehow it's

19
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:53,664
Yeah yeah

20
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,992
It's super fun and thanks to them again for having

21
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:59,040
I doubt if you I've not heard it

22
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:00,832
My bright spot

23
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:04,672
What is Night 2 of WrestleMania from Sunday

24
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:06,720
I am shocked

25
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:08,512
Cheers in a jigger

26
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:13,632
Yes to the radio

27
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:16,192
And add the last man standing match

28
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:17,472
They built up a great

29
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:23,872
Feud between two that was really engaging as a storyline but that match went on 40 minutes

30
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:30,272
40 minutes 40 minutes I got very bored

31
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:33,600
Difficult to beat up the other person

32
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:38,720
Can't stand up within 10 second always the tension of but getting

33
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:42,304
Seconds and struggling to get to your feet of course of course

34
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,912
Such a f****** stretch Tyson Punch-Out rules

35
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:49,216
But all of that was banished

36
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:49,984
From my mind

37
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:53,312
After the John Cena and Bray Wyatt

38
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:56,384
Firefly Funhouse match

39
00:02:56,896 --> 00:03:01,760
The best we were talking after the show and you were like

40
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,808
What I'm looking at

41
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:06,880
The scene has a habit of pulling out people's old

42
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,928
Pass characters

43
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:15,328
And then I recalled edibility of

44
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:21,472
Overtime in space

45
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:26,848
He also has a character Bray Wyatt is possessed by this demon called the fiend

46
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:33,248
That has superpowers of some sort

47
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:39,648
Like their psychology or something and show them something of themselves that maybe they didn't want to ask

48
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:43,232
OK Google

49
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:47,328
It was masterful

50
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:50,400
The short film that they put together and cuz it wasn't a match

51
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:52,192
Wasn't John Cena fighting

52
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:54,240
Bray Wyatt

53
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:57,056
What it was was basically a short film

54
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:01,408
The audience was taken Inside the Mind of John Cena

55
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,688
John Cena's the most

56
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:03,712
Like the biggest

57
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:08,320
WWE wrestling Superstar from like last 15 years ago

58
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,600
Did the hero of the

59
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,136
The children be like the bigger

60
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:15,232
The top of guy in the brexit team time world champion tour

61
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:19,327
Seeking inside his mind and thoroughly deconstructed

62
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,119
To the point where he accepts

63
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,167
He's the bad guy

64
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:24,191
It was

65
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:28,799
Remarkable

66
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:32,639
What is going on

67
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:36,223
First of all the

68
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,271
Bexar does the complexity

69
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:41,855
And the story is something I

70
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:47,743
Did not imagine the WWE's capable of

71
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:54,399
Like giving the how big of a person he is and how much he doesn't need to do something like this

72
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:59,007
Bray Wyatt

73
00:04:59,263 --> 00:04:59,775
2

74
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:05,919
Put him into a psychological prison

75
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:11,551
No he's auditioning for Shutter Island to that's the days you're going to feel next I think that's

76
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:15,903
God it was good like I really I had very

77
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:18,463
Scared expectations about it

78
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:20,255
I'm an old-time Bray Wyatt

79
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:23,327
I mean as much as I am a wrestling fan

80
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:29,727
That's my kind of thing original character was a swamp hillbilly cult leader

81
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:33,567
Ramblin weird riddles

82
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:35,615
Absolute nonsense so good

83
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:39,711
Impenetrable want something like really to workout and then nothing

84
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:43,295
I never does his is a story lines always kind of fizzled a little bit

85
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:49,183
But until I have to take a real feeling that like this was going to be another one of those things

86
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:55,327
Cuz they tried to do some Bray Wyatt like spooky house matches in the path of his master

87
00:05:55,583 --> 00:06:00,959
I just really thought they were going to do that again and instead what they got was a scathing portrait of

88
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:08,383
First of all John Cena's character trajectory through his career to the WWE itself

89
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,407
Haha

90
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,687
Vince McMahon

91
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:14,527
Deeply emotional resonance

92
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:15,295
Because

93
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,319
Throughout it

94
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:22,719
Character of Bray Wyatt is sort of guiding John Cena through these realization

95
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,839
To recognize like

96
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:30,911
This thing about himself and because of John

97
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,191
Ego

98
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:36,543
Recognizing leads to the ultimate conclusion of John being destroyed

99
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:43,967
David Lynch is working for the WWE for one night

100
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:46,783
I will claim that I'm not like a huge wrestling fan

101
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:51,903
I don't think that I am in the same way that most people like wrestling

102
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:54,207
But I think it has a remarkable potential

103
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,487
As a storytelling

104
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:56,255
Medium

105
00:06:56,511 --> 00:07:02,399
Both earring matches and stuff like this the characters that they're able to build

106
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:05,983
Because you suspend disbelief to the flowers like

107
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:09,567
You get a demon anime

108
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:15,455
Cookies neon shirt wearing a fake soldiers last battle rapper

109
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:17,247
Geico

110
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:23,647
What are you guys think dick Whitman is more believable I am just I like the medium for the things like

111
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:25,183
That that it is capable of

112
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,487
Very proud of them and it's very big break

113
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:29,279
Canadian visa this week

114
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:36,703
Loved it I'm glad I watched it a second time.

115
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,263
Yeah I had to go back and like

116
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,031
That those

117
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:45,919
I watched it the second time the next day cuz I walked away from it feeling like that was

118
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:46,943
Tacular

119
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:52,319
I second-guess myself

120
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:55,391
I don't remember to be clear I don't want them to do a lot more of it

121
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,671
No absolutely

122
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:59,999
Probably f*** it up

123
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,023
Yes

124
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,071
Compared to the Undertaker matches

125
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:08,191
Did your feelings on that I would not have been as bad as I thought it was corny as hell

126
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,215
This was corny

127
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:11,007
In some ways but with

128
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:15,103
Perceived be a lot more depth to it

129
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:21,503
Okay I don't know the difference between do you want like a goofy 80s Thriller action movie

130
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,599
Horror movie or do you want some like 10 psychological Thriller

131
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:30,463
It also gets a little cornball every now and again

132
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,743
You can't go wrong

133
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,535
Unless you talk about Oliver Twist

134
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:34,815
Yeah you can

135
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,863
Get some weird like

136
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:39,423
Union nonsense going on here wrestling a scrape

137
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:45,823

Or you could find a local charity in your area to help out with the folks

164
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:24,895
Yes we would like both

165
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,967
What are the other

166
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,503
Alright

167
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:36,927
Jordan said I said we're going over the April 5th episode of Alice the show here's the thing

168
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:42,303
Bathing B Cassidy over Project Camelot

169
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:50,751
I just didn't I didn't I wasn't finding a lot of inspiration and some of the places that we might look for Wacky Wednesday

170
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:51,519
Episode

171
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:56,383
And things got kind of kind of weird with Alex to cuz you put out a Saturday

172
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,175
Episode of his show that was

173
00:10:59,199 --> 00:10:59,711
Long

174
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,735
And boring

175
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:01,759
And awful

176
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:06,879
So I wasted a lot of time listening to that Friday's episode is no good Monday

177
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:08,415
He was out of Studio

178
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:11,999
Wasn't into it was meant to be on the 6th cuz he was in Family Court

179
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:15,839
He was having to deal with that emotion

180
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:19,935
That to his ex-wife it filed

181
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:20,959
Right

182
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:24,031
So you thought he was up Studio that leaves us really

183
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:26,335
Only with April 5th the Sunday show

184
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:31,967
And we should check in on this so I wasn't actually I actually think this is a pretty important

185
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,247
Cover because

186
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:39,391
There's something really stupid fun things here but also there is a development

187
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:43,231
Some narrative that will probably be a problem

188
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,303
We start off

189
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:48,607
Alex

190
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,399
Pretty do me kind of feline

191
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:56,031
We are live ladies and gentlemen hummus April 5th Sunday transmission which is down

192
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:03,967
IHOP

193
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:10,367
Attalla Fishel the United Nations has released guidelines written by Bella morte agates found

194
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:16,767
Or go back to work under the new worldwide martial law

195
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:20,607
Until you been forcibly inoculated

196
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,143
Okay alright

197
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:28,543
You did not find any evidence of any of that stuff but

198
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,567
Vegetarian little something

199
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:33,151
So on some recent episodes

200
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:35,711
Assertive coming into into existence

201
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,991
That is

202
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:42,111
Comparing the coronavirus to the flu

203
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:46,463
Pasty started to really get more interested in talking about it as cold

204
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:48,511
And I think part of that is because

205
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:54,911
Maybe someone told him that coronavirus is in the family coronavirus can cause

206
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,191
Common cold

207
00:12:56,447 --> 00:13:02,591
And I think that he's like you know what people are way less afraid of the cold than they are of flus

208
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,615
Run with that

209
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:06,687
Really downplaying try and get as many people here this week

210
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:08,991
Yeah so now that is evolving

211
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:15,135
And he's starting to suggest that people who are testing positive for Coronavirus

212
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:21,279
Covid-19 they actually are false positives of God because they have the cold

213
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,839
I'm not joking around

214
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:33,567
Common cold in your life

215
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:37,407
Chelsea everyone that medical doctor come on show about this

216
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,479
Medical doctors

217
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:43,295
Lung problems or other diseases

218
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:45,599
Old

219
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,135
Heart attack

220
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,159
Telangana

221
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,951
You died of Toby

222
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:50,719
19

223
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,279
Create

224
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:57,887
So I understand Alex's desperation to come up with a conspiracy here but what

225
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:59,167
Justin does not mix

226
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:06,079
Partially because it's a scientifically dumb but more importantly because he seems to be ignoring a very little relevance

227
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:06,847
Statistic

228
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:10,431
It's probably safe to say that literally everyone on the planet

229
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,711
Planet has gotten the cold

230
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:15,551
Most people catch colds at least once a year sometimes a couple times

231
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:16,319
In a year

232
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:21,439
If it were the case that the coronavirus test for just creating false positives reboot had the cold

233
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:24,767
You'd expect a did he wouldn't see so many of them come back negative

234
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:31,679
How does Alex explain that there have been almost two million tests done in the US and only a little over three hundred seventy thousand of them

235
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,447
Positive

236
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:37,055
If it were really just catching the common cold that number would be much higher

237
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:39,615
In order for Alex to credibly even suggest

238
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:40,895
This conspiracy I'm going to

239
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:43,199
Need for him to deal with that gigantic

240
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,735
Problem in the beer

241
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:46,783
How would she want to because you're pulling

242
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:47,551
Things out of that

243
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,319
I doubt it

244
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:50,623
False positives from the cold man

245
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:52,415
This is also one of the

246
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:53,695
Situation

247
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:54,463
And where

248
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,487
There's a

249
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,255
Deserve

250
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,023
Media

251
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,303
Blackout over

252
00:14:59,071 --> 00:14:59,839
Like you can't show any

253
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,119
What's going on

254
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,655
People are being intubated

255
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:09,311
People are coughing up blood they are they are this is how people are are dying their lungs are f******

256
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,335
Exploding

257
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:12,639
That is not the goddamn common cold

258
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:17,759
No by no stretch and if there was some if there was a more general knowledge of like

259
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:19,551
This is how people are dying

260
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:22,367
It would be real hard to sell the common cold there

261
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:29,023
Yeah I would have to sell it anyway

262
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:29,791
Says words

263
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:39,263
So he has now base this he's established this narrative that there's a lot of false positives just people have a cold

264
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,591
And Egyptian to predicting the future

265
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:46,943
Where anybody who dies they'll say it's Coronavirus

266
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,807
I'm cold

267
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:54,367
They will make sure

268
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:04,095
They're going to roll it out

269
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:05,631
You got

270
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:11,263
Antibodies or you can't work earlier house

271
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,287
That's all

272
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:16,895
The one thing is really thought about this narrative this thing of the vaccine

273
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:18,431
I already existing

274
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:22,527
It started when Alex began covering the internet conspiracy about the pier

275
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:25,599
Attitude which held the patent free does vaccine for chicken

276
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:30,207
Which was completely misrepresented you know just because it involved

277
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,231
Coronavirus

278
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:32,767
Chicken factory

279
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:34,559
What is the Coronavirus

280
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,327
Hey don't worry

281
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:41,727
This is fun because that conspiracy before Alex picked up on it it all traces directly back to Jordans

282
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:43,775
Who's a big qanon guy

283
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,591
Alex is in the middle of this supposed to war against

284
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:52,479
Even recognized or accepted a bunch of his information and narratives come directly from the very people

285
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:54,015
He's attacking his idiots

286
00:16:55,039 --> 00:17:01,183
So I was watching Alex's show from Saturday like I mentioned and he had Francis Boyle on the show where they discuss this Gates patent

287
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:01,951
Situation

288
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:04,511
In that segment they addressed the fact

289
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:06,303
The purebright patent is for chicken

290
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:08,607
But then they claim that there are other

291
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:12,703
Oh okay well that helps which Alex been flashes up on screen

292
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,519
Sure you can Google him I'll give you the patent numbers

293
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:17,311
One of them is US patent

294
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:21,663
10130701 B2

295
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,455
This is for the pure Brighton

296
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:25,247
Coronavirus

297
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:27,039
Alex just shows the first

298
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,575
Page on screen which is good

299
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,343
It says that

300
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,367
Coronavirus

301
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,903
Purebred

302
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:34,975
But if you scroll the page for you to your grass

303
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:37,535
There it's about the incidence of sneaking

304
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:38,815
Which is a thing that chickens do

305
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,375
The second graph is for wheezing

306
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,911
I guess humans do to

307
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:45,215
However the y-axis of a graph is quote

308
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:47,263
Percentage of birds affected

309
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:50,591
This is just the chickens being again

310
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:53,407
Alright you're telling me that no people's neck

311
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,943
I think people snake all of its

312
00:17:55,199 --> 00:18:01,343
That's just a thing that normal people do as I understand it to be correlated issue

313
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:03,135
This guy

314
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:06,207
Adobe

315
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,511
So the other one

316
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:09,791
That was about

317
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:17,727
The only other patent Alex shows.on are is a filing from the European patent

318
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:20,543
Number 1575

319
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,823
1009

320
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,359
3.5

321
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:26,431
Which game is just a b chicken vaccine

322
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:30,015
Alex has nothing but I will grant videos a whole lot of nothing

323
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:32,575
It's true he has tripled his nothing

324
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:33,343
Yes yes

325
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:37,439
And all of it off

326
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,975
But he's mad at me

327
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:39,743
It is

328
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:40,767
It is

329
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:41,535
It is hard to

330
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:42,815
Focus on those

331
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,351
Styx hear what you said he is

332
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:47,423
What is it is very difficult because this is so awful

333
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,447
Yeah

334
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:50,751
Also like with this like he's

335
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:57,151
This is all just arrived from Jordan sather stuff who was a huge qanon guy

336
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,431
They like to visit

337
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:04,831
Today is the day that Alex unmasked

338
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:10,719
Studio C

339
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:14,303
Microchip out that's my guy

340
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:18,911
So Alex gets down to talking about the house

341
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,447
The gate spokes

342
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:22,239
Cuz they already have this vaccine injury

343
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,311
Sure

344
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:31,711
But they're also doing this tattoo thing the tattoo that'll give you your virus record

345
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:32,735
Stuff

346
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:34,271
Apparently

347
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,295
The Source on this

348
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,575
It goes bad

349
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:40,671
How about this for a long time

350
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:43,999
Covid-19

351
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:48,095
A digital tattoo

352
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:51,935
Nanotech

353
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:56,031
Black light

354
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:59,359
Have your medical records

355
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,175
Cut it out a digital

356
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,711
DNA mark

357
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:15,487
I went to dinner with us tonight

358
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:20,351
Church event about the microchip

359
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:23,935
God gave me a vision it's going to be a DNA tattoo

360
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:25,471
On the left

361
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:29,055
Okay bo back then

362
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:32,639

Ladies and gentlemen

366
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:47,487
That guy is hanging out with your friend of yours in high-school girlfriend state

367
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:52,607
Christian identity

368
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:56,703
I believe head vision

369
00:20:57,471 --> 00:21:00,287
Good night bro

370
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:02,079
You didn't break anything uses

371
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:07,967
Reporting on another article in some some publication about this research that was being done

372
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:12,831
We can't they don't have the technology to do these tattoos yet

373
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:13,599
Alex

374
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,367
To break a story

375
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:17,696
Certainly doesn't have that to have brains

376
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:25,120
So Alex gets into legit lying about primary sources that stuff starts kind of slow

377
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:30,496
Picks up at the end of this irresponsible starts off a little slow

378
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:35,616
Talk about

379
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:38,944
Actually went to Berkeley and gave a speech

380
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:43,040
Everything

381
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:44,576
I remember

382
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:45,856
Publix

383
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:47,136
Is not

384
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,672
Didn't say that

385
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:49,952
Is a futurist

386
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,488
Projection of the world

387
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,280
We want to build my 20

388
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:54,560
Did say that

389
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:55,584
Crazy person

390
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:00,192
Contemporaries

391
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:05,568
Talked about diet injections and injunctions controlling you and making you dumb answers

392
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,640
Vaccines are trojan horse piggyback

393
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,712
With

394
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:13,248
Systems that lower IQ

395
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:19,904
So none of that is accurate from the Brave New World Revisited

396
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:24,000
I highly recommend speaker

397
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:30,400
And you can get a little bit more context of what Aldous Huxley was actually saying in that speech it was mostly about

398
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:31,936
The comparison between

399
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:32,704
Himself

400
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,032
And Orwell 1984 system versus

401
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,824
The Brave New World System

402
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:42,176
What which which would be the more likely version that this

403
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,968
Could rise up in

404
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:50,112
That's kind of what he was getting at this is our plan as we doing haha sucker

405
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:51,392
Absolute

406
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:56,000
But the other part they're his contemporaries. But Bertrand Russell

407
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:57,280
Right now

408
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:59,072
Diet injections and injunction

409
00:22:59,328 --> 00:22:59,840
Send blind

410
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:02,912
Alex just takes out of context we talked about this a bunch

411
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:09,824
Bertrand Russell was talking about what would have happened if the Nazis had won World War II and had become a sign

412
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,616
And typically run system

413
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:14,176
Amazing they were that to be the case

414
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:15,712
Had the Nazis won

415
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:18,016
Which is a bad thing didn't want to happen

416
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:20,576
They became a scientifically run system

417
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:22,880
Diet injections and injunctions

418
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:24,928
Control the population

419
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:26,720
This is not them saying

420
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:31,072
This is what we're doing anything about like

421
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:35,680
Hypothetical situations or analyses of

422
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:37,216
Sting's

423
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:39,520
This is what everyone

424
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:42,592
Right. It's very weird I mean it's it's

425
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:43,360
Go back to

426
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:45,152
Obviously

427
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:47,200
Doesn't he doesn't do this with

428
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:47,968
Other

429
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:51,296
Things that don't with that work against his narrative

430
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:52,576
Also

431
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:54,624
Bertrand Russell was wrong anyways

432
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,696
Because as we all know the Nazis won World War 2 + 20

433
00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:00,512
60 that's pretty much how it went down

434
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:03,072
Two ended but then there was a re-emergence

435
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:05,888
Yeah the Nazis Nazis had a great comeback

436
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,168
Back is bottom of the ninth

437
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:09,984
President

438
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:12,032
And then they swung for the fences

439
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:14,592
Speaking of pretty shocking comebacks

440
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:21,760
Alex has been really against the globalists in their extermination plan

441
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:23,808
Him sort of coming around

442
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:26,368
Well it's not a bad idea it's just there the one

443
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:33,280
Yeah it seems like that wasn't what is really starting to feel like

444
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:38,912
They finance

445
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,568
Is pretty lazy

446
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:47,360
Doesn't cramp

447
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:51,712
Maybe Bill Gates is right

448
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,016
Not fair

449
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:58,880
Okay

450
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:01,952
I would say that if you're hearing person

451
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:07,328
I don't know why I like

452
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:11,936
Extermination of the population is warranted because people are lazy and dumb

453
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:13,728
Miniature pit

454
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:20,896
Exterminator population all those folks

455
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:24,736
God kills road so no one could be fine and you know

456
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:29,600
God Exterminating people all the time a God-fearing man is probably Pro extermination lesbian

457
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:31,648
It's it's

458
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:38,048
Seems like a misunderstanding of some of the finer points

459
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,584
Christianity

460
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,352
You know people

461
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:41,888
I think that the New Testament is a bookie

462
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:43,168
Great nice disagreeing

463
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,448
I think

464
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,984
That it is ludic

465
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,568
Chris and also very fun / scary

466
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,640
That Alex is now coming around to this like

467
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:55,456
Pocket The Golden Shoe

468
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:59,552
Entails

469
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,856
Mbway more fine with

470
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:02,880
Mass death

471
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:03,904
Yeah

472
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,976
Like I don't know Trump do something f***** up

473
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:10,304
As long as it's couched in the sort of

474
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,096
Framing

475
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:13,120
Fighting the globalist

476
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:15,168
Or whatever

477
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:17,216
Why should I

478
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,008
Why should I

479
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:24,640
F*** you

480
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:28,224
I killed by a backstory

481
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:33,600
But there aren't dark moments that I've had looking at Biden poll numbers going

482
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,160
You-know-what f*****

483
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:39,744
I got nothing for you you guys want to do it you do it

484
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,024
I'm not saying nothing

485
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,328
But that's not a way to live your life

486
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:48,448
There's a difference between the service moments of Despair you might have of like

487
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:51,008
We are we are not going to make Prague

488
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:53,056
Those are those are

489
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:56,128
Tough moments of reflection much like me

490
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:57,152
Before

491
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:59,456
WrestleMania Night 2

492
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:02,272
And then the dark

493
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,040
This comes right

494
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:05,600
Well maybe not but

495
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:06,368
There's a difference

496
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:12,256
Between that and being like a long times I have prophesied if I ever needs would exterminate everyone and I

497
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:17,888
Dedicated my life to fighting against that Bubba have f****** maybe the right

498
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:21,728
There is a difference validation of Alex's protect

499
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:22,496
Everything

500
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:29,152
Bill Gates's Redi-Care

501
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:34,016
We'll see what happens

502
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:37,600
Well so we have this next clip Alex

503
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:38,624
Has had

504
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,392
Famous people

505
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:41,952
Call there like a man

506
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:42,720
And you're right

507
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:43,744
Ted Nugent

508
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,280
Probably

509
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:50,400
Bragg's

510
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:56,032
Rock stars movie soundtrack

511
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:58,336
National talk show host

512
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:04,736
Well I thought you were wrong you really a right and and I'm going OK Google do something

513
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:07,552
Nothing to me

514
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:15,232
I want to talk to you

515
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:17,024
Monisha

516
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,304
Right

517
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:22,400
Alright bye

518
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:23,936
Come out and do something

519
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:25,472
Alright you strfkr

520
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:28,288
Hold on what you got is going to lose everything

521
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:31,104
We would fight

522
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:34,944
On average

523
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:36,224
Soft

524
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:38,784
And we're stupid

525
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,392
Okay

526
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:48,512
Even further deserve to die

527
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:49,536
Good

528
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:55,936
I don't know he's Rich famous super-mega stars are but I do love you I do love the idea of

529
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:06,432
Thanks for telling me I'm right but if I can't get any PR out of this I don't give a s***

530
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:07,200
Christopher Walken

531
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:10,016
Can finally call her back after all those

532
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:13,856
He's just calling back he doesn't want to tell Alex he's right but he has another chicken wrap

533
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:17,184
Listen to the bells a little bit more read

534
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:19,232
And I got to say you're right

535
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:20,768
To you

536
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,072
Who do you think Alex's

537
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,376
His version of like

538
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:27,680
Really famous like

539
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:28,960
Megastar

540
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:29,728
I don't know I

541
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:34,336
Play me some country music

542
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,664
Willie Nelson's drummer

543
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:44,320
I don't I don't know who this I don't know who these people are and I guess probably never will

544
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:52,000
So Alex has Gaston the show and it's a guy who gave a speech at CPAC at the z-pack

545
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:53,792
Of course he sucks

546
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:55,584
Is

547
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:58,912
His speech at CPAC was pretty boring

548
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:00,448
Is just bad comedy

549
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:02,496
A real tough time with it

550
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:08,640
Based on this interview he's Rising the ranks in terms of like people I really dislike

551
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:11,200
He has one of the most annoying

552
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:15,808
Speech delivery like just the way he speaks very very annoying

553
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:21,440
Very condescending

554
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,000
Epic Dodge

555
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:26,304
The world

556
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:29,888
Won't check it out

557
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:31,168
Another bright side

558
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,704
The Pampered Pet Shop

559
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:36,032
Comedy

560
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,616
Story

561
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:41,152
Breaking down the fact that

562
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:46,528
A big money

563
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,112
Nope

564
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:54,208
Bill Gates is running

565
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:58,560
That's a very inaccurate reading those

566
00:30:58,816 --> 00:30:59,584
Philanthropy

567
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,656
So it's so weird how whatever these people are getting Patrick

568
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:03,680
Howley's credit

569
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:09,056
Holly Hawley

570
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:13,408
How we adjust lurid why where I grew up so I do not entirely.

571
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:20,064
Patrick Holly

572
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,344
Forget that he started big

573
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,368
Politics

574
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:27,744
What does just a shity right-wing conspiracy blog that eventually sold to a right-wing political consultant

575
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,376
And it continues to exist as a propaganda Outlet in some cases for the very politicians

576
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:39,776
The website that never comes up almost like even though they know it makes him look superb

577
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:46,176
Credibility

578
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:46,944
They say when you come

579
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:47,712
To politics

580
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:49,248
You got to get it in

581
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,856
X is not one of us out there

582
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:57,696
It's a rapidly conspiratorial publication that Alex just likes because

583
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:59,232
Ferociously pro-trump

584
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:00,512
And super anti-cheat

585
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,048
It's run by the

586
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:04,352
Falun gong religious movement

587
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:07,680
According to reporting from NBC News

588
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:13,824
Former practitioners of Silent Kong told NBC news that Believers think the world is headed towards a Judgment Day

589
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,896
When those labeled communist 2bcentral kind of hell

590
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:19,968
And those sympathetic to the spiritual Community will be spared

591
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,808
Trump is viewed as a key out of eye in the anti-communist fight

592
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:27,392
Epochtimes employees

593
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:31,744
You can see how it's really be into that kind of editorial position

594
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:34,816
It's run by the spa

595
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:36,864
Okay

596
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:37,888
On October

597
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:45,056
The October 17th 2009 the founder of the following Kong movie

598
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:47,104
Spoke to the staff of the epoch times

599
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:49,920
In the message that was sent was a little messed up

600
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:51,968
It's very clear that the newspaper is in

601
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:53,504
An extension of an apocalypse

602
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:58,368
Religious belief that looks forward to an Ultimate Clash with Communism particularly in the form of

603
00:32:58,624 --> 00:32:59,136
China

604
00:32:59,392 --> 00:32:59,904
From the speech

605
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:00,672
Beach quote

606
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:07,072
Visions of the epoch times in other languages are crucial as well for dafa disciples are the sole hope

607
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:10,912
For salvation for the world's people whatever corner of the earth and have it

608
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:17,312
It wouldn't work if I leave humzy who serves as the master to the Disciples of dolphin took on this work as we

609
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,360
It's something that you must do

610
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,152
My involvement will happen later

611
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:23,712
After the fall rectify the human world

612
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:27,808
Before the time of the Fall rectifying the human world you must save more people

613
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:30,112
And allow more of the world's people to remain

614
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:36,768
In the process of clarifying the truth invalidating the thought and saving the sentient beings sugar enabling

615
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:39,072
A people to survive the great catastrophe

616
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:42,656
And the only just portion of the human race will be worthy of seeing

617
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:46,496
During these stage of boz rectification of the human world

618
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:49,312
The true picture of the cosmos and all that is occurred so

619
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:50,336
The world's creation

620
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:51,616
Only

621
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:55,968
After that we'll I commence fall rectification of the human world

622
00:33:56,224 --> 00:34:00,576
Many things need to be done if this plane of existence has to be kept for human affairs

623
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:01,856
Are really not so simple

624
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:08,512
Saving sentient beings is something that has to be done by you and during this. You are given this path so that you may

625
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:10,048
May establish Mighty virtue

626
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:12,096
With Your Righteous thoughts in action

627
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:16,192
Head towards consummation

628
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:21,312
Most of the beach is about how you need to get this in line like

629
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:23,104
Normal media Outlets

630
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:25,152
Alright everybody

631
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:28,480
You do all the work and then after it's over

632
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:30,016
I will definitely help out

633
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:35,904
And that is nothing at all like a cult leader and it's nothing at all like hey if I were like

634
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:41,536
Really directing everything here people would see what's up later

635
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:44,608
You guys got to do this because it doesn't really look like

636
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:45,632
I'm

637
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:49,216
Exerting my will through this publication

638
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:51,520
It's not ideal

639
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:58,176
The situation between falun gong in the state of China is far too complicated for me to unpack here but please don't take anything that I'm saying

640
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:01,504
2B minimizing of the repression

641
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,320
The China has engaged in regarding regarding religion

642
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:08,416
Absolutely I'm not minimizing guide at all answers

643
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:11,744
You know just because Fallon Kong Run

644
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,024
This paper that is

645
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,048
Bad as f***

646
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,840
Doesn't mean that it's

647
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:16,864
Within

648
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,656
A reasonable response

649
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:20,704
Incarcerated

650
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:22,496
A depressed people

651
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:24,800
Yeah yeah

652
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:27,360
But anyway the point here is that this is not a good news source

653
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:31,200
Is there any communist propaganda Depot run in the service of a religious mission

654
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:32,992
Can you believe that's heading towards in Apocalypto

655
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:35,040
Standoff against demonic communist

656
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:39,904
Oh and also yeah you know there's a lot of overlap

657
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:47,584
Now where they differ Jordan is at the epoch times has definitely promoted the qanon conspiracy

658
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:53,984
That's the only one okay

659
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:57,312
It's almost like

660
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:58,080
Batteries

661
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:01,152
It's almost like there's really no difference they're beating

662
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:01,920
Into just about

663
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,528
Anyway Patrick Ali also writes for them

664
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:07,296
Yeah he's a hero

665
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,856
Do Alex believes that

666
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:11,136
Bill Gates is out to get him

667
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:12,416
Because

668
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:13,184
Garcia's

669
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:22,912
Like the good doctor Ali shows

670
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:35,968
Is dumb

671
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:47,488
Asian gentleman

672
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:57,216
I want more than Facebook

673
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:59,520
Yeah that is more I need more than

674
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:04,640
Demonstrating some way that Bill Gates is behind lawsuits against you

675
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:08,992
It was Bill Gates did he buy osaki

676
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:10,016
Absolutely

677
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:18,208
I miss Soros or somewhere of course

678
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:20,768
Gates

679
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:24,864
I love I like the I like store

680
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:25,632
He's actually

681
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:27,168
Seems to be a

682
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:27,936
Fairly good guy

683
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:29,472
Where's Cape Cod

684
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:34,336
Cirrhosis more relevant to the like antifa narratives that Alex has

685
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:40,736
So the contract contracts

686
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:41,760
I think that

687
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:42,784
You know

688
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,832
Certainly antifa isn't getting

689
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:45,600
In the mix

690
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:46,368
Well there's a

691
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:48,672
The quarantine going on

692
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:51,744
Appear whenever there's right-wing demonstration

693
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:56,608
And so

694
00:37:57,632 --> 00:38:02,496
Tell Patrick jumps in and I got to be honest I don't like this guy but

695
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:04,288
What you got to give up to him

696
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:07,872
You got to tip your hat to the fact that he is using

697
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:09,664
Good at saying he has sores

698
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:11,200
What the hell's going on here

699
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,368
Insiders

700
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:22,976
And

701
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:32,448
I am

702
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:37,056
Thesaurus

703
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:38,848
Back to Insiders

704
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:40,640
$0.01

705
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:44,224
We do agree with you he has the most annoying speech patterns

706
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:48,576
It's rough it is really rough listen to this

707
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:53,440
He seemed like if he was talking about something that I was interested in

708
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:54,720
I would still think

709
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:56,000
You are really angry

710
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:57,792
Yeah

711
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:00,864
Dude

712
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:04,192
Calm down you are so mad

713
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:12,384
Like I would love to hear analysis from other people about the Firefly Funhouse match and it Patrick

714
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,944
He was talking about it I would not want to listen

715
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,992
You're so mad

716
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:19,552
Talk about how good a match it was still

717
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:23,392
And he's on the chloroquine

718
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:24,672
Narrative

719
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,208
We can't believe we're still doing

720
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:35,424
We're going to be

721
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,640
Hydroxychloroquine

722
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:49,248
Trump discovered it

723
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:05,376
Call Mom

724
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,504
Is there a chrome reference bro

725
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:23,808
These people

726
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,112
Yeah this is a little this is a Little Lamb

727
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:26,880
I just

728
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:28,160
Lineup

729
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:28,928
Just light up the

730
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:29,952
You guys are

731
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:31,744
Feel like

732
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,584
There's such a rank misunderstanding about these folks

733
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:41,216
Got to be careful when you're talking about something like a medication

734
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:44,800
Yeah they take that to be like you're opposed to it

735
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:51,200
Actual good human trials that have been done that hydroxychloroquine

736
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:51,968
Was effective

737
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:53,248
I don't

738
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:59,392
Think that anyone would be against it and no one is saying like hey

739
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:00,416
Cut it out

740
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:01,696
Reel it in

741
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:04,768
You can get people hurt with talk like this

742
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:07,072
We've already seen some like at least one

743
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:08,352
Documented death

744
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:10,144
From people taking this advice

745
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:13,216
And the possibility of a lot more does

746
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:15,776
Exist that's what you have to be careful with those things

747
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:19,360
That's not being anti chloroquine or whatever

748
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:20,384
It's such a

749
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,944
Such a stupid black and white way of looking at

750
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:25,504
It is it is interesting

751
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:28,320
If if we accept the hypothesis

752
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:29,088
That Alex

753
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:29,856
Knows he's

754
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:30,624
Lying about

755
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:33,952
Yes then it is hard to take his opening

756
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:34,720
Bank statements

757
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:40,608
Everybody's f****** stupid and sheep and I I just I guess maybe they do need to get rid of

758
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:42,912
As being anything other than him talking about his

759
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:43,680
Is Brett

760
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:46,496
Well we know he complains about his friends a lot

761
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:48,544
Exactly and his listeners like this

762
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,824
If you believe with Alex

763
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:52,384
Alex is talking about

764
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,663
Might be

765
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:54,431
Put away

766
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:55,711
Fauci

767
00:41:56,223 --> 00:42:01,855
You know he's coming out here and he's saying the chloroquine the devil they spray

768
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:03,647
But it turns out

769
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:05,695
Used to be into chloroquine

770
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:12,095
Obama like this

771
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:13,631
And

772
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:16,447
Bobcat

773
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:17,727
Coronavirus

774
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:22,591
Stay-at-home order

775
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:28,991
Freedom

776
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:40,255
You're a shity Lionel

777
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:41,279
Donkey Kong

778
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:43,839
100 million-dollar Grant fears go

779
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:46,399
They were arguing

780
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:49,983
Begin your job

781
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:54,335
So many selfies history as it relates to the HIV crisis

782
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:58,175
Is simultaneously a complicated one and a not so complicated one

783
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:04,831
The HIV activist to put him back then exactly the sort of government bureaucrat

784
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:06,879
Kind of guy that you might expect

785
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:08,671
But he was receptive

786
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:09,439
Alyssa

787
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:13,023
And eventually became an important Ally in that Public Health crisis

788
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:19,423
Oh that's a recipe for getting killed by the right-wing in 2020 an article on the body

789
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:20,959
Epro discusses how

790
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:27,615
He dramatically loosened HIV drug clinical trial requirements so that a far greater number of discs desperate

791
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:29,407
Patients could try new compound

792
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:31,199
An approach called parallel tracking

793
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:37,087
Expanded research on hiv-aids and its treatment in under-represented women and or people of color

794
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:41,183
And gave activists and people living with HIV seats at the table

795
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:43,743
Of the planning committee of the AIDS clinical trials

796
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:44,511
Group

797
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:45,535
The article quotes

798
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:47,839
Jim iGo who was an activist with Act

799
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:49,119
Stop who said quote

800
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:51,167
Thought you was a sparring partner with us

801
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:51,935
Then a friend

802
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:55,007
They also quote and Northup Northrup

803
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:56,543
Another act up

804
00:43:57,823 --> 00:44:01,919
I would say that at the beginning of his encounters with us he was a pretty typical bureaucrat

805
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:05,759
Making excuses for the slow pace of drug investigations in approval

806
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:12,159
I still give him credit for turning into someone who listened more to the activist point-of-view and eventually became more of an ally

807
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:19,327
They're definitely plenty of criticisms that could be made of his and any government entities handling of the HIV crisis

808
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:21,887
In the eighties and nineties but it's a little much

809
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:24,447
Say the factory was involved in this cover-up or something

810
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:29,823
And it's especially Rich coming from Alex who constantly has Jon rappoport on his show as a medical

811
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:35,199
Expert considering the hiv-2 nihilist who sells DVDs of his lectures on the subject

812
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:36,223
Nyitcom

813
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:38,015
Wheat lack of medical qualification

814
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:41,599
Answer the question of course Quintin burst

815
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:44,159
That's a completely different matter than what we're dealing with today

816
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:50,815
One with Patrick is probably referring to an article in NBC news from May 20th 2014 title

817
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:52,863
MERS cure

818
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:54,655
Lots of drugs

819
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:56,703
Might fight virus study finds

820
00:44:57,727 --> 00:45:00,799
Corcoran was one of the drugs that were included in that

821
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:01,823
Lots of drugs

822
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:04,383
I'm here's what Anthony fauci said back then

823
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:06,175
It's a good start

824
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:09,247
You try to stay ahead of the game there's a host of things were doing

825
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:12,063
Hopefully we will never have to use any of them

826
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:18,975
I would need Patrick to provide stronger evidence than this to back up his claim to Tachi was all about chloroquine back when Obama was President

827
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:19,999
But now he's against

828
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:22,559
It also

829
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:27,423
What does Patrick mean when he says that Deborah Deborah birx was appointed by Obama

830
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:33,311
She was made the US Global AIDS coordinator by Obama in 2014 but that wasn't her first

831
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:34,079
Position in government

832
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:38,943
Who's the director of the cdc's division of global HIV and AIDS since 2000

833
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:41,247
Which predates Obama's presidency

834
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:42,783
If you was working at the NIH

835
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:44,063
1986

836
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:47,647
Obama became a senator in 2040 probably appointed her back

837
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:56,351
You became a community organizer he was anointed from

838
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:05,311
Inform

839
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:09,407
He was appointed as a position by Obama but it means

840
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:10,175
Nothing

841
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:13,247
And the stupid conspiracy that he's going on so whatever

842
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:15,551
It's easy whenever you're ahead guy

843
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:18,879
Whom you love so much your dear leader has never held a position

844
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:21,183
Giving government for you to convince your listeners that

845
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:22,463
Nobody else has eyes

846
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:24,511
Yeah

847
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:30,143
Or that everybody who you don't like in the moment their history starts when Obama did something

848
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:34,239
Quite accurate public servant

849
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:35,007
4

850
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:41,151
I can't imagine somebody wanting to be a public servant to serve the public than that sounds crazy

851
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:44,991
That sounds absolutely insane I'm going to assume that she's a globalist out

852
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:46,783
Probably help

853
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:48,575
Anyway

854
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:53,951
There's this weird Obsession that I see on Alex's show make another point of that

855
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:58,559
I'm at is the Alex is only real argument that he has about

856
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:01,887
How Trump was handling this correctly

857
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:04,959
How many used to be the Trump secretly declared an emergency

858
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:07,519
Fancy month ago

859
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:09,567
No and Alex's stop saying that

860
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:13,919
The only thing that's really consistent in terms of evidence that Trump was on the ball

861
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:15,199
He was taking care of business

862
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:15,967
PCB

863
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:19,039
Turner overdrive out there

864
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:23,647
Is the only example he has is the Trump tried to block flights

865
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:25,695
It's from China

866
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:29,023
He did it only thing he could have saved us

867
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:34,399
Flies

868
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:37,983
You talk as though he acted later sis Walden

869
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:46,943
He's been a bad guy

870
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:52,063
And everyone that has

871
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:57,695
Incredible

872
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:02,559
So Patrick agreeing with that is disqualifying

873
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:04,095
Is like

874
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:07,935
Ramble through a load of nonsense

875
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:14,591
I understand him agreed with the narrative the Trump tried to block these flights and therefore he did everything he was supposed to do

876
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:16,127
Nonsense

877
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:22,015
Tccu directive that literally laid out the

878
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:23,039
The plans for what

879
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:24,063
Needed to be done in

880
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:24,831
The situation

881
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:26,111
Adhered

882
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:26,879
That would be great

883
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:29,439
Right right there is there's a there is a

884
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:31,999
Hon of breakdown you could do on that show

885
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:33,023
That front

886
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:36,351
But Alex does have a xenophobic position just as assertive

887
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:38,143
The center

888
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:42,239
And so the idea that he tried to stop travel is like that

889
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:44,031
That's all you need to do

890
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:46,591
Which is silly because it's not that Caravan

891
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:49,151
Now he tried to stop light because I mean

892
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:50,687
Obviously

893
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:55,039
I think Anna episode talked about

894
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:56,575
Spasibo the stuff

895
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:57,599
We talked about how the

896
00:48:57,855 --> 00:48:58,623
These travel restrictions

897
00:48:58,879 --> 00:48:59,903
Don't really work

898
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:03,487
They can slow things down a little bit but they don't really work

899
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:08,095
Because if you have these cases that are identified in China uses

900
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:09,887
Shut off travel from China

901
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:12,959
Look some of these cases might already be outside of China

902
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:14,751
So you can have someone

903
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:15,519
From

904
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:16,543
Russia

905
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:18,079
Neighboring country or whatever

906
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:19,103
Who comes over

907
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:20,639
You don't have a travel restriction there

908
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:21,919
You can still get it

909
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:25,503
There might be some slowing down of progression that you can do

910
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:29,599
Maybe there's some value to that but consequences of it are

911
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:31,903
Our baby makes things even worse

912
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:33,951
It's a complicated picture but

913
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:38,815
It's the only thing I would stairs about but I understand the idea that Patrick would agree with that

914
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:41,119
The fact that he's just like yeah

915
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:45,727
When Alex is saying that anybody who tests positive for antibodies to the Cole

916
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:47,775
Any kind of Coronavirus

917
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:48,799
Is

918
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:50,079
Being called covid-19

919
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:53,919
Is he even have anything to base that on

920
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:57,247
He gives no citation no evidence of that at all

921
00:49:57,759 --> 00:49:58,271
I I don't

922
00:49:58,527 --> 00:50:01,087
See any reason to think that he's not just making that up

923
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:02,879
Yeah cuz he's

924
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:04,415
Probably making it up

925
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:06,719
Patrick's

926
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:13,119
Communist propaganda gas and guy so

927
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:14,399
What was the b******* I was about to

928
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:16,703
Why not agree with you now and skip that

929
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:19,007
Patrick might be about to swing you

930
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:20,799
I doubt it

931
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:23,359
Cuz he's been talk some s*** on Joe Biden okay

932
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:24,895
Now I still doubt it

933
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:27,455
Tubi

934
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:30,783
This is an instance where Joe Biden be done dirty

935
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:37,439
Corsi is because criticism that you have a bite and are almost

936
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:43,839
Equally applicable to make up some b******* this one is also from 2005

937
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:52,031
Yeah that's good to Roberts confirmation

938
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:55,103
Joe Biden

939
00:50:58,687 --> 00:50:59,711
You up

940
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:12,255
The mark of the beast

941
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:19,679
This guy is an Angry Kid

942
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:25,055
I've never been checkmated more than I haven't seen anything in the Bible about vaccine

943
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:27,359
So this is really fun

944
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:33,247
All these dumb dumb conspiracy theorists like to trot out this quote from Joe Biden during the John Roberts confirmation

945
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:38,111
The claim that bike wants to microchip everyone and bring his into the bark of the Beast or whatever

946
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:43,231
This always use in a recent post on National file

947
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:45,791
Will be faced with equally consequence

948
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:47,327
Precision for the 21st century

949
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:48,607
Can a microscopic

950
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:51,679
Quick Tag being planted in a person's body to track his every movement

951
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:53,471
There's actual discussion about that

952
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:55,519
You will rule on that mark my words

953
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:56,799
For your tenure is over

954
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:58,591
Can brain scan be used

955
00:51:58,847 --> 00:52:01,151
To determine whether a person's a person

956
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:05,247
Inclined for criminality or violent Behavior you will rule on that

957
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:09,599
It's sort of a quote is one that is begging for surrounding Conte

958
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:13,183
What do we take a take a look and listen to abide with

959
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:17,791
Actually saying that we don't have recordings from 2005-10 that's too far in the past

960
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:21,631
I actually bought one of my magical powers

961
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:23,679
Is I go back in time

962
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:27,007
Cuz I believe our constitution is

963
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:27,775
Is big and a

964
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:28,543
Is Grand and a

965
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:29,311
Is great as its

966
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:31,103
Archives

967
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:32,639
Journey did not stop

968
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:33,663
Women being Barton

969
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:34,431
Being lawyers

970
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:35,455
With 10 year old

971
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:37,247
Working in coal mines or black

972
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:38,271
Forced into differ

973
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:39,039
Preschools in white

974
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:41,087
Because

975
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:42,111
The Constitution

976
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:42,879
In the concert

977
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:44,927
Does it mention

978
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:45,695
Texas

979
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:46,463
Emanation

980
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:47,487
Child labor

981
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:48,767
Segregation

982
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:49,791
It doesn't meant

983
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:54,911
Our constitution Journey did not stop then and it must not stop now judge

984
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:56,191
Then we'll be faced with

985
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:56,959
Equally concert

986
00:52:57,471 --> 00:52:58,751
Decisions in the 21st century

987
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:00,031
Can

988
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:01,055
A microscopic

989
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:01,823
Tag being

990
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:03,359
Planning in a person's body

991
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:05,151
To track his every movement there's

992
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:06,431
Discussion about that

993
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:08,223
You will rule on that Mark

994
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:08,991
Mark my word

995
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:10,783
Before your tenure is over

996
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:12,575
Can brain scan

997
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:13,599
Be used

998
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:15,391
Determine whether a person's incline

999
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:17,183
Criminality or violent Behavior

1000
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:18,463
You will

1001
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:19,231
Rule

1002
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:21,535
Enjoy China

1003
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:23,071
I need to know whether you will be a judge

1004
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:24,095
She believes

1005
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:25,887
At the Constitutional Journey must

1006
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:26,655
Continue

1007
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:28,191
The speak to these cars

1008
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:29,983
Consequential decision

1009
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:31,263
Gone far enough

1010
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:34,079
Checking against government intrusion into our economy

1011
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:36,127
Into the most personal decisions we make

1012
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:38,943
What is a critical mode

1013
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:45,599
Whoops Pipers actually bring this possibility up as an example of Robert temperature

1014
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:51,999
Government intrusion into our autonomy

1015
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:53,279
Is that before confirming him

1016
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:58,399
Patrick jalapenos good and goddamn well the next thing Biden says in their confirmation

1017
00:53:58,655 --> 00:54:00,191
Hearing is that knows that

1018
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:05,055
Because it invalidates the narrative he's trying to build that out of context quote

1019
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:07,359
This is what lawyers do

1020
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:09,663
Touch bullet for as much as I hate by

1021
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:10,687
James O'Keefe

1022
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:13,503
He's came out with a video professing to show anything I feel like

1023
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:14,271
Go fuc

1024
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:16,831
Yourself I don't give a s*** what you lying piece

1025
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:20,927
To say it's one of those things are like you shouldn't

1026
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:24,511
I mean you can almost always make that assumption and you're almost always be right

1027
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:31,679
You know airing too much on the side of I assume you're wrong therefore I won't take anything you say is being Plaza

1028
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:36,799
Can be just as destructive of a pew

1029
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:38,591
From bikes.

1030
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:44,991
Constantly looking into all of these things over and over again never is something above

1031
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:51,391
Put out by almost anybody using associative Alex Jones I will give them 1% of the benefit of

1032
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:54,719
That's a little bit of a hybrid across for me to give a

1033
00:54:55,999 --> 00:54:57,535
Did the thing is like

1034
00:54:58,559 --> 00:54:59,327
That quote

1035
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:01,375
You can use it and you do

1036
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:02,911
Like someone like Patrick does

1037
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:03,935
But

1038
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:06,751
The reality is he knows I can he

1039
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:08,799
Unless he just read it

1040
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:09,823
On some

1041
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:12,639
Website completely devoid of context

1042
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:13,407
Any dinner

1043
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:14,431
Look into it

1044
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:16,479
He has to have watched

1045
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:18,527
Cast of Xena

1046
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:23,135
I don't believe that he wouldn't be like wait what does that mean what is he trying to say

1047
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:25,951
And he's not that he's not a curious person he and I

1048
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:30,047
That means like I don't know maybe you shouldn't be in the line you're at

1049
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:31,583
You shouldn't be in

1050
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:35,423
A position where you're conveying information to people

1051
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:39,263
If you are not curious about what that information means

1052
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:42,335
Inappropriate content

1053
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:44,895
And his job is not to convey information is

1054
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:46,687
His job is to spread propaganda

1055
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:50,271
Isn't the perfect line of work and maybe right

1056
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:55,135
So also he is against a Patrick is against immigration

1057
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:56,671
Quite a bit can't imagine

1058
00:55:58,207 --> 00:56:03,583
He doesn't like the idea that government giving money to bail out these busy

1059
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:04,351
Genesis

1060
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:09,727
Had something to do with immigration he wants them to he wants these businesses

1061
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:10,751
Fail

1062
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:11,519
Sure

1063
00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:13,055
Something to do with punishing

1064
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:15,615
This is weird this is a weird Clara outside

1065
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:17,151
Backward Disturbed

1066
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:24,319
Democrats

1067
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:35,583
Weather

1068
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:42,239
China virus

1069
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:45,311
We're shut down

1070
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:49,151
Guatemala Dustin

1071
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:54,015
I don't know how it's admittedly

1072
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:55,551
Globalist operation

1073
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:57,855
Take any of those things they're saying

1074
00:56:58,367 --> 00:57:00,415
Now the thing I think is really itchy

1075
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:02,207
Is Patrick

1076
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:02,975
Polly is

1077
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:03,999
Clearly serious

1078
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:05,535
These companies for

1079
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:07,071
Encouraging immigration

1080
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:11,167
Because he believes it will lead to a Democratic Socialist

1081
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:14,239
Locksmith Corporation

1082
00:57:15,007 --> 00:57:15,519
Sure

1083
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:17,311
So that's weird

1084
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:20,639
MoneyGram in responsibilities as f*** it let up

1085
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:24,735
Dealing with right now

1086
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:28,575
The Reeds bilotti's businesses will fail is because business

1087
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:29,599
Is it have to be closed

1088
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:31,903
Because they're on essential business

1089
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:34,719
So when he's talking about this that's

1090
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:35,743
Clearly what

1091
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:38,815
Is trying to be mitigated by these government effort

1092
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:39,583
Yeah you would

1093
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:42,399
I think that doing a good thing would be recognized as a good

1094
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:44,191
What do you mean

1095
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:47,775
Alpha triphala

1096
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:54,175
Talking about small government

1097
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:55,199
Google

1098
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:57,247
Like that kind of like the cruise line

1099
00:57:57,503 --> 00:58:00,319
Industry

1100
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:01,855
I don't know anyway

1101
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:09,279
The distinction is very is very weird because he want these businesses to fail as some sort of a punishment because they

1102
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:10,559
Encourage immigration

1103
00:58:10,815 --> 00:58:11,327
Can is mine

1104
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:13,375
Simultaneously

1105
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:15,679
He also wants people to go back to work

1106
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:32,575
We've been wondering

1107
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:44,863
Set a one world government

1108
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:49,215
Greta thunberg

1109
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:52,287
This guy gets it

1110
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:53,311
Go to bed

1111
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:59,711
She's go way on the one hand he wants all these big businesses to fail and then on the other

1112
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:03,295
The stock market is going down

1113
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:06,367
Back to work

1114
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:11,487
Nmds are things that are said with him like a minute of each other it doesn't make sense to me

1115
00:59:11,743 --> 00:59:12,255
It is

1116
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:14,047
It is

1117
00:59:14,303 --> 00:59:17,119
Trump to save businesses

1118
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:18,655
Stock market

1119
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:20,959
By making people go back to work

1120
00:59:21,215 --> 00:59:23,775
Risk to their own personal safety

1121
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:25,055
Hate each other safety

1122
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:29,407
But also f*** these big businesses they should go out of business because I hate immigration

1123
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:30,943
Yes I don't get it

1124
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:31,711
Perfect sense

1125
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:35,807
There's there's nobody that I want to

1126
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:36,831
Support

1127
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:38,111
Somebody who looks at

1128
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:39,135
Hundreds of thousands

1129
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:39,903
The people dying

1130
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:40,671
Across the world

1131
00:59:41,439 --> 00:59:42,975
Thank God we have a republic

1132
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:44,511
Can president who's willing to look at

1133
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:47,071
I want that's

1134
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:48,095

1137
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:53,727
Lying on my craft is

1138
00:59:53,983 --> 00:59:55,263
You know what is Annie's real.

1139
00:59:56,287 --> 00:59:58,335
You know what I like to do is Alexandra stock-market right

1140

I take a Stock's price

1141
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:01,663
On the exit

1142
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:03,711
Church is not on the y-axis

1143
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:13,695
Gotcha Patrick Ali is gone and good riddance

1144
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:17,279
I do not look forward to his next appearance on the Shelf

1145
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:20,351
Voice is tough

1146
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:21,631
Continuing to speak ever

1147
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:23,167
Even if you was interesting

1148
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:29,567
Has like in the same way that someone like Leo zagami is or something I still wouldn't have a real tough time sitting

1149
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:33,919
Yeah I wouldn't like it

1150
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:35,455
Euless Junior light

01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:37,503
Yeah really shity version

1152
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:43,903
Voice is super annoying I do get a lot of feedback from listeners about that pie too much Lionel

1153
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:47,999
It's better than that

1154
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:50,559
So Alex is next

1155
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:51,327
Yes

1156
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:54,143
Start the second anniversary

1157
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:57,983
Thought this was big news a shower we got good news next

1158
01:00:58,751 --> 01:00:59,775
You think that.

1159
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:01,567
Chloroquine

1160
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:02,847
Good

1161
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:10,527
Or something even matter I did a bunch of research talk to a bunch of medical doctors at a lot of stuff from today about that

1162
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:12,575
Medical

1163
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:15,391
Almost there till

1164
01:01:15,903 --> 01:01:16,671
Myself

1165
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:23,071
On whether some talk about this

1166
01:01:24,095 --> 01:01:24,607
Coming up

1167
01:01:26,143 --> 01:01:28,959
Bellingham

1168
01:01:29,471 --> 01:01:31,519
Multi-vitamin the real red pill

1169
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:35,615
50% off right now you know

1170
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:40,479
You know what just got think they're now I'm not saying this because anything I'm not

1171
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:42,015
Connecting zigs to any

1172
01:01:42,271 --> 01:01:46,111
The situation right now that it has zinc in it

1173
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:50,463
Perhaps on episodes prior I have made it baby

1174
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:56,863
Maybe you could use one of these things called a hypothetical syllogism and put together a quiz BB

1175
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:59,679
Equals C equals Seafood

1176
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:01,215
Together on Durant

1177
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:01,983
CiCi's not smart

1178
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:03,007
Figured that

1179
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:07,359
Maybe that's not illegal

1180
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:12,223
So what are the things I think is really funny there's out cuz I don't know if I want to bring this

1181
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:14,015
Information that I

1182
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:16,319
I'm presenting is really important

1183
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:17,855
Health information to you because

1184
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:24,255
I know that I'm going to cause a run on a product that I want to make sure I have some myself

1185
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:25,279
Estranged

1186
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:26,047
Altruist

1187
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:26,815
Two-person rates

1188
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:29,375
Tell you about the Cure

1189
01:02:29,631 --> 01:02:35,775
As soon as I already have a bunch of it

1190
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:42,943
How do you know that mice like beat myself

1191
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:46,015
I've been a fan of shows in the past

1192
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:49,599
And I know that when a certain guest is on that show

1193
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:52,927
Like a podcast this is going to be good

1194
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:57,791
What shows up on Google

1195
01:02:58,047 --> 01:03:04,191
Yeah that's going okay I'll be Lee's here exactly like that I wonder

1196
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:06,751
There are people who listen to Alex Jones

1197
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:11,103
He's like we got Mike Adams coming up in the like holy

1198
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:15,967
How to get the good info right now getting real

1199
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:18,015
0 dead everybody

1200
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:24,671
I wonder if there is a community of people who like legitimately view his

1201
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:27,231
Recurring guest as

1202
01:03:28,511 --> 01:03:29,791
The same way we look at like

1203
01:03:30,047 --> 01:03:34,399
NAD daily or Mike Schmidt on never not funny or something

1204
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:35,679
Have to be right there

1205
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:36,447
Has to be something

1206
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:38,239
Let's discuss

1207
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:39,775
That's really sad to think

1208
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:42,591
Think about

1209
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:45,663
That's the reverse of right spot

1210
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:48,479
So Alex Goes To Break

1211
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:52,063
Ups that Mike Adams coming up he's not here yet

1212
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:53,599
But he does have another guest

1213
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:56,927
That is a big old gun on his desk

1214
01:03:58,207 --> 01:04:03,327
Noticed that I have a very nice

1215
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:09,727
German firearm

1216
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:12,799
Submachine gun

1217
01:04:15,103 --> 01:04:17,407
Submachine gun

1218
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:20,479
For hunting

1219
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:24,063
Smaller butt rifles

1220
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:26,623
308 and I've got

1221
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:29,183
338 Lapua

1222
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:31,743
This is part of my favorite gun

1223
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:33,279
Bullseye

1224
01:04:33,535 --> 01:04:34,047
Pretty much

1225
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:37,375
What time is it in water yards without even trying with us

1226
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:39,935
Magnified scope

1227
01:04:41,727 --> 01:04:42,239
When hunting

1228
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:50,431
But this is this is what I've got my car

1229
01:04:52,991 --> 01:04:53,503
Super accurate

1230
01:04:54,783 --> 01:05:00,927
People robbing somebody

1231
01:05:02,975 --> 01:05:05,023
Robert

1232
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:05,791
Bank robber

1233
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:11,423
Boat situation we are all very often

1234
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:18,079
I'm driving around with my by rifle of the Guard I think the bank robbers

1235
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:23,455
Stop a bank robber look at like the Hamburglar running into the First National

1236
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:29,855
If I hear about what the Dalton Gang is up to I'm going to be there buddy

1237
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:32,671
I love it I love it

1238
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:34,207
I guarantee he's never used

1239
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:38,559
Is that gun if any of her bank robbery

1240
01:05:38,815 --> 01:05:39,327
Similars

1241
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:40,095
Situation

1242
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:45,727
I don't want to be a dick and be like that you know like you know whatever having a gun for

1243
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:47,519
Protection and Edsel

1244
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:51,359
Is a categorically a bad thing

1245
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:54,175
Ludacris and so funny

1246
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:59,551
Imagine

1247
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:02,111
He keeps it in his car just

1248
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:04,927
In case of bankruptcy breaks out

1249
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:09,279
What is the right

1250
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:13,631
Do deliver fdic-insured they're mixed up with the Fed

1251
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:15,423
Does it give a s***

1252
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:23,615
I feel like from be more likely to use that rifle in a bank robbery

1253
01:06:24,127 --> 01:06:25,151
Yeah

1254
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:30,527
That is such that I didn't like

1255
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:33,343
Mark Wahlberg be like mad if I was on that plane I was.

1256
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:41,535
Misguided heroic

1257
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:43,071
Go away

1258
01:06:43,327 --> 01:06:46,399
So Alex gets into this next clip talking about like

1259
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:47,167
Why

1260
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:48,191
Is the Ghana

1261
01:06:48,447 --> 01:06:50,239
The desk beyond the fact that he loves guns

1262
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:51,263
He likes to show him

1263
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:00,223
What they lie about

1264
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:07,391
Little kids

1265
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:13,279
Tell you nobody forgot her by vaccine their damn Liars

1266
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:15,839
The car wreck

1267
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:19,167
Play Saint nobody died at Sandy Hook

1268
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:24,031
So Alex Baker completely incoherent

1269
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:27,359
If you track his logic it breaks down like this

1270
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:28,895
He loves this gun

1271
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:30,175
Because it gives protection

1272
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:31,455
Can also be used

1273
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:35,807
In the same way Alex would love vaccines the gay protection

1274
01:07:36,063 --> 01:07:37,599
Except they're being used to hurt

1275
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:41,951
Vaccines are bad is there they lie about them being safe

1276
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:43,999
Which I don't know what you mean by that

1277
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:49,887
In my experience the lies about vaccine safety that I've encountered have almost entirely come from Alex's side

1278
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:55,263
Doctors in public health experts don't say the vaccines in or any medication or totally

1279
01:07:55,775 --> 01:07:57,055
They generally are pretty clear

1280
01:07:57,311 --> 01:07:59,359
Everything comes with potential side effects

1281
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:02,687
But that the incidence of those side effects are almost negligible

1282
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:04,223
Compared to the benefit derived

1283
01:08:04,479 --> 01:08:04,991
Vaccine

1284
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:08,831
Also Alex and his friends constantly lie Bavaria side effects

1285
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:09,599
Play Imagine

1286
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:10,367
A vaccine

1287
01:08:11,647 --> 01:08:13,183
Vaccine courts are not Secret

1288
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:17,791
People's identity being kept private because that's confidential medical information

1289
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:19,839
It can't be released without invading pay

1290
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:20,607
Patients privacy

1291
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:24,959
We talked about it a bunch of the past but these payments are made not because the courts

1292
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:25,727
Definitively

1293
01:08:25,983 --> 01:08:30,335
The negative experiences possibly related to vaccines were caused by vaccine

1294
01:08:30,847 --> 01:08:31,871
But because

1295
01:08:32,127 --> 01:08:34,175
The system were set up in any other way

1296
01:08:34,431 --> 01:08:36,479
Medical progress or be completely stalled

1297
01:08:36,735 --> 01:08:39,039
And these people would end up losing almost all of the

1298
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:40,319
These cases in normal courts

1299
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:43,391
The burden of proof is actually way way lower

1300
01:08:43,647 --> 01:08:46,463
Any vaccine damage Court than they would be in any other venue

1301
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:50,303
Mostly cuz very few of these people could ever make their case in an actual Court

1302
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:54,911
The comparing this to the situation with people being shot by guns as interesting

1303
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:58,495
Because the folks that receive coverage by these vaccine courts

1304
01:08:58,751 --> 01:09:01,567
Protected by them to accept

1305
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:02,847
Yeah the vaccine

1306
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:05,663
They were certain amount of liability protection

1307
01:09:05,919 --> 01:09:09,759
Because of the gigantic public health benefit they provide

1308
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:11,039
Which would be stopped

1309
01:09:11,295 --> 01:09:13,087
By having to deal with

1310
01:09:13,343 --> 01:09:14,623
The time

1311
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:17,951
But gun manufacturers are even more

1312
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:23,583
You really can't sue a gun manufacturer if one of their products is used in a murder of one of your loved one

1313
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:28,447
The Supreme Court decided in November 2019 that Sandy Hook families could

1314
01:09:28,703 --> 01:09:29,727
Remington

1315
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:31,263
Which is something to watch

1316
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:32,543
Historically

1317
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:34,591
That's not been something that's worked out because

1318
01:09:34,847 --> 01:09:37,919
How someone uses a product isn't the responsibility of the product

1319
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:39,455
Maker generally speaking

1320
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:43,295
I don't understand that concept as it relates to guns perfectly well

1321
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:44,575
And he yells better all the time

1322
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:49,951
At the end there he says the giving a kid a vaccine is like shooting them with an MP5

1323
01:09:50,207 --> 01:09:52,255
Which it's not but let's imagine that

1324
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:57,887
In the case of a kid being shot with an MP5 Alex would scream bloody murder someone tried to sue the Gun Man

1325
01:09:58,143 --> 01:09:58,655
Manufacturer

1326
01:09:58,911 --> 01:10:01,471
Or the NRA for promoting gods or anybody

1327
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:04,031
Accept the person who did the shooting themselves

1328
01:10:04,543 --> 01:10:07,615
But in the case of vaccine you want to put the entire system on trial

1329
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:10,175
As opposed to just the Doctor Who administer the shot

1330
01:10:11,711 --> 01:10:13,247
Typically I think all of this is stupid

1331
01:10:13,503 --> 01:10:18,111
But I only bring any of this up because Alex is trying to use a metaphor that absolutely does not work

1332
01:10:18,623 --> 01:10:19,647
Given his beliefs

1333
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:25,279
Unless he's willing to accept a gun manufacturer should be opened up to liability for Damage Done by their product

1334
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:29,375
It doesn't make any sense for him to be advocating that kind of thing for vaccine manufacturers

1335
01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:30,911
It doesn't it I mean

1336
01:10:31,423 --> 01:10:33,727
If you want to talk about someone who's hurt by like mouth

1337
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:35,775
Practice that involves a vaccine

1338
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:39,103
Isn't that might be the same as like accidentally shooting somebody

1339
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:42,943
But the metaphor doesn't hold if it was an immigrant

1340
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:43,711
Who

1341
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:45,759
It's a malpractice

1342
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:47,039
And Alex Wood

1343
01:10:47,295 --> 01:10:49,087
Never ever ever ever shut the

1344
01:10:49,599 --> 01:10:53,439
Certainly that would become a years-long running thing

1345
01:10:53,695 --> 01:10:55,487
The immigrants are the ones you created

1346
01:10:55,743 --> 01:10:59,327
Texting problem with the way he is

1347
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:05,727
And the only reason I think it's actually interesting at all this cuz he went out of his way to put a gun on his desk in order to make this better

1348
01:11:05,983 --> 01:11:09,311
For this poorly thought-out contradictory

1349
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:10,079
Yes

1350
01:11:12,127 --> 01:11:14,687
What's a good summation of Alex's show

1351
01:11:14,943 --> 01:11:19,039
I've got a gun out here to make a point that doesn't make sense

1352
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:20,063
Actually

1353
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:22,367
Goes actively against who I stated principal

1354
01:11:23,391 --> 01:11:24,159
Gunn yep that's

1355
01:11:26,463 --> 01:11:28,767
Janelle Alex teas that Mike Adams is going to be on

1356
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:30,303
Talk about this new miracle cure

1357
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:31,839
And

1358
01:11:32,351 --> 01:11:33,375
Has Alex already got into

1359
01:11:34,911 --> 01:11:38,751
Has he already gotten a bunch of the miracle. I mean in the last like 15 minutes

1360
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:39,775
Maybe even bless

1361
01:11:40,031 --> 01:11:41,055
I know it's probably a couple

1362
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:42,335
No

1363
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:48,735
Alright well then I can't believe I didn't matter cuz my cuz already put an article out on natural news about desk

1364
01:11:48,991 --> 01:11:50,527
What is out

1365
01:11:50,783 --> 01:11:51,551
More Ebola

1366
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:53,087
No

1367
01:11:53,599 --> 01:11:54,879
No this is actually like

1368
01:11:55,135 --> 01:11:56,415
Closer to like

1369
01:11:57,439 --> 01:12:00,255
In terms of like the really irresponsible stuff they do

1370
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:04,095
The kernel of reality here is closer to like

1371
01:12:04,351 --> 01:12:05,631
This is in the Publix in

1372
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:06,655
Tristan like

1373
01:12:06,911 --> 01:12:11,775
Maybe discuss a little bit okay but

1374
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:14,591
We'll get to that ear Alex intros Mike

1375
01:12:14,847 --> 01:12:16,895
To get into the the topic of the day

1376
01:12:17,407 --> 01:12:19,455
This is a big story naturalnews.com

1377
01:12:22,527 --> 01:12:24,831
Whatever you do information War

1378
01:12:25,599 --> 01:12:27,135
Burl Ives

1379
01:12:30,975 --> 01:12:32,511
Essentially Limited

1380
01:12:32,767 --> 01:12:33,279
Material

1381
01:12:33,535 --> 01:12:35,071
Covid-19 hours

1382
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:38,655
This right now is my calves this is really exciting news my

1383
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:42,239
News

1384
01:12:42,495 --> 01:12:43,007
I think the

1385
01:12:43,775 --> 01:12:45,055
Way to defeat the globalist is to

1386
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:45,823
Defeat

1387
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:46,591
The Coronavirus

1388
01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:47,615
Because if they can

1389
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:51,199
You keep this thing circulating

1390
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:54,015
We would cut off their vaccine agenda is to be

1391
01:12:56,063 --> 01:12:57,343
Even taking much time at all

1392
01:12:57,599 --> 01:12:59,135
We can beat it I believe with these kinds

1393
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:00,671
The off-label

1394
01:13:00,927 --> 01:13:02,975
Prescription drugs are off pathan

1395
01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:09,375
So what we have here there is that what they're promoting is this thing called Ivermectin

1396
01:13:09,887 --> 01:13:11,935
Is the name of the the drug

1397
01:13:12,447 --> 01:13:14,495
And so will what you got here

1398
01:13:16,031 --> 01:13:19,871
It was a study that came out recently in the journal antiviral research

1399
01:13:20,127 --> 01:13:21,407
She was released on April 2nd

1400
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:25,503
News report about some research it was down about the anti-parasitic medication

1401
01:13:25,759 --> 01:13:27,551
Ivermectin and its possible effect

1402
01:13:27,807 --> 01:13:29,087
On the Coronavirus

1403
01:13:29,599 --> 01:13:35,743
Their findings taken simply show that Ivermectin could decrease the viral load approximately 99.98

1404
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:37,279
Percent in 48 hours

1405
01:13:37,535 --> 01:13:38,047
Which sounds

1406
01:13:38,303 --> 01:13:39,071
Pretty exciting

1407
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:42,399
But it's important to recognize that this is not conclusive

1408
01:13:42,655 --> 01:13:43,935
And there are caveat

1409
01:13:44,447 --> 01:13:49,567
The first is that this study was done on human cells outside the body or what's known as in vitro

1410
01:13:49,823 --> 01:13:52,127
So to take these findings just

1411
01:13:52,383 --> 01:13:56,735
Assume that they depict exactly how the body would react to the drug if you took it is pretty reckless

1412
01:13:57,247 --> 01:14:00,319
It indicates a little bit of a lack of understanding about how the body works

1413
01:14:00,575 --> 01:14:02,111
Which is what these dudes are about to

1414
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:03,647
Engagement wholesale

1415
01:14:03,903 --> 01:14:04,415
Don't ya

1416
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:11,071
You can get one result in isolated cells outside the body but these cells went inside a human body.

1417
01:14:11,327 --> 01:14:13,119
Exist the same way they do in a petri dish

1418
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:17,471
Their components of a larger system that has complicated inputs and variables

1419
01:14:17,727 --> 01:14:21,311
They can completely change the results of any in vitro study you might do

1420
01:14:21,567 --> 01:14:23,359
This isn't to say that this test

1421
01:14:23,615 --> 01:14:24,639
Through this sort of thing is worth

1422
01:14:25,663 --> 01:14:29,759
But the results of a test like this or things that should be taken as a stepping stone

1423
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:31,551
Is a sign of a possibility

1424
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:32,831
But not something that's

1425
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:34,623
Whatever the effect

1426
01:14:35,135 --> 01:14:35,647
That this

1427
01:14:35,903 --> 01:14:37,695
Ivermectin has

1428
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:39,231
On these human cells

1429
01:14:39,743 --> 01:14:40,767
Could be

1430
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:46,655
Undone by some biological process within the body when the cells aren't isolated

1431
01:14:46,911 --> 01:14:47,935
You don't know

1432
01:14:48,191 --> 01:14:49,215
It's interesting

1433
01:14:49,471 --> 01:14:50,495
It's compelling

1434
01:14:51,519 --> 01:14:53,567
Almost demands further study

1435
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:55,359
But it is not something

1436
01:14:55,615 --> 01:14:56,639
That you can say

1437
01:14:57,151 --> 01:15:00,223
Gets rid of 98.98% of

1438
01:15:00,479 --> 01:15:02,783
Coronavirus taken by people or whatever

1439
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:04,831
Like that is that where you get them

1440
01:15:05,087 --> 01:15:06,367
Trouble you just blew my mind

1441
01:15:06,623 --> 01:15:07,391
So you're telling me that

1442
01:15:07,647 --> 01:15:08,671
The human cells outside

1443
01:15:08,927 --> 01:15:09,439
The body can read

1444
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:10,463
Differently than human

1445
01:15:11,231 --> 01:15:11,743
Inside of the body

1446
01:15:11,999 --> 01:15:16,607
That's f****** great I just found out that you can transmit a disease when you don't have symptoms

1447
01:15:16,863 --> 01:15:20,703
Dad I take all of my scientific advice from Georgia governor

1448
01:15:20,959 --> 01:15:24,543
That's what I do here they might not even know about the other one

1449
01:15:24,799 --> 01:15:25,823
Yeah

1450
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:30,431
It is because I like what I was saying is like this is interesting

1451
01:15:30,687 --> 01:15:36,063
And it's not something in the same vein as right the chloroquine because

1452
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:40,671
Who studies were pretty

1453
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:45,023
Cuz I know I certainly would be in no position to know this year

1454
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:50,143
But from what it said on the website of this of this journal this

1455
01:15:50,655 --> 01:15:54,751
Antiviral research Journal Review

1456
01:15:55,007 --> 01:15:55,519
Just some

1457
01:15:55,775 --> 01:15:57,055
Thrown up again

1458
01:15:57,311 --> 01:15:58,591
Promising study that shows

1459
01:15:58,847 --> 01:16:00,639
Real signs of possibility

1460
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:02,687
However that doesn't mean any

1461
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:04,735
Incredibly promising

1462
01:16:04,991 --> 01:16:05,503
Is putting a

1463
01:16:05,759 --> 01:16:06,783
To strongly

1464
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:13,183
Yes some potential

1465
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:15,487
What did Emma study itself which concludes quote

1466
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:19,327
Altogether the current report combined with known safety profiles

1467
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:25,471
Demonstrates that Ivermectin is worthy of further consideration as a possible Source coronavirus to antiviral

1468
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:28,799
The study shows that more research should be done and

1469
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:29,567
Not

1470
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:31,103
But this should be promoted as a cure

1471
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:35,199
Without to my car doing and getting ready to do is deeply a responsible

1472
01:16:35,455 --> 01:16:38,527
They just jump from one unproven miracle cure to another because

1473
01:16:38,783 --> 01:16:40,063
They can't do anything else

1474
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:42,367
Their worldview and narratives has no depth

1475
01:16:42,879 --> 01:16:44,415
So they just have to keep moving

1476
01:16:44,671 --> 01:16:45,183
Deep crap

1477
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:47,487
Crafting elaborate and exciting things to

1478
01:16:47,743 --> 01:16:48,511
To distract Their audience

1479
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:50,047
Realizing their full of s***

1480
01:16:50,303 --> 01:16:52,863
And also another element to it is I think that they

1481
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:54,143
To do stuff like this

1482
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:55,679
Because the alternative

1483
01:16:55,935 --> 01:16:59,519
Is the stuff that Alex was doing on the last episode that ended up getting into

1484
01:16:59,775 --> 01:17:01,311
Cause for war with China

1485
01:17:01,823 --> 01:17:02,335
Like

1486
01:17:02,591 --> 01:17:05,663
If you if you pursue that path too far

1487
01:17:05,919 --> 01:17:06,431
You're going

1488
01:17:06,943 --> 01:17:08,223
Tons of people killed

1489
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:12,063
Yep through Street violence against chinese-american

1490
01:17:12,575 --> 01:17:14,623
You have to do something like this

1491
01:17:15,135 --> 01:17:18,719
To make it so the focus isn't all on Sabre rattle

1492
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:23,327
Because there's another way to do this is just do neither

1493
01:17:23,839 --> 01:17:24,863
You can get away with

1494
01:17:26,655 --> 01:17:27,935
Influencing a lot of death

1495
01:17:28,703 --> 01:17:29,215
Slowly over

1496
01:17:29,471 --> 01:17:29,983
Time by

1497
01:17:31,263 --> 01:17:31,775
Easier than

1498
01:17:32,031 --> 01:17:32,799
You can get away with calling

1499
01:17:33,055 --> 01:17:33,567
Infor War

1500
01:17:34,591 --> 01:17:36,895
Probably I'll do hold that thought until the end of this episode

1501
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:41,759
Cuz we might also be at War but hey what you going to do

1502
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:45,855
It's a mess these dudes

1503
01:17:46,111 --> 01:17:48,415
These dudes are really taking this study

1504
01:17:50,463 --> 01:17:50,975
And going

1505
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:51,999
Too hard with

1506
01:17:52,255 --> 01:17:53,535
Doing too much

1507
01:17:54,047 --> 01:17:56,095
This story is about Ivermectin

1508
01:17:56,351 --> 01:17:59,167
Which is an agricultural drug you can buy it

1509
01:18:00,959 --> 01:18:01,983
Supply retail stores

1510
01:18:05,823 --> 01:18:06,591
Deworming

1511
01:18:06,847 --> 01:18:07,359
Drug

1512
01:18:09,407 --> 01:18:10,431
Inexpensive

1513
01:18:20,671 --> 01:18:25,023
Oh you're getting sick take dewormer I remember him drinking dewormer

1514
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:26,559
30 years ago bro

1515
01:18:27,839 --> 01:18:28,351
We miss him

1516
01:18:28,607 --> 01:18:30,399
30 years ago bro

1517
01:18:30,655 --> 01:18:31,167
Bro

1518
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:32,703
Hobbit drinking Ivermectin

1519
01:18:33,215 --> 01:18:34,239
30 Years bro

1520
01:18:34,495 --> 01:18:40,639
Can I eat can't be reached to guest on this episode cuz he died

1521
01:18:43,455 --> 01:18:47,807
This is a medication that is mostly a Veterinary medication

1522
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:49,343
There is a human version

1523
01:18:49,599 --> 01:18:51,135
But it's called stromectol

1524
01:18:51,903 --> 01:18:52,415
That is

1525
01:18:52,671 --> 01:18:53,183
Prescription drug

1526
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:56,767
What human is doing is advocating the people take

1527
01:18:57,023 --> 01:18:57,791
Animal that's

1528
01:18:58,559 --> 01:19:01,375
Really take a step back and let that soak in

1529
01:19:01,631 --> 01:19:06,239
The health Ranger is promoting animal medications is a cure for the Coronavirus

1530
01:19:06,495 --> 01:19:09,823
Based on his very much inconclusive study he doesn't understand

1531
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:13,407
That's staggering stuff like Take It Outside of the prism of life

1532
01:19:13,663 --> 01:19:16,479
Yeah we are we weird in this world so we have like

1533
01:19:16,735 --> 01:19:19,551
So much jadedness to the

1534
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:25,695
You just do write that down on a piece of paper and you give it to somebody to read who doesn't know about

1535
01:19:28,767 --> 01:19:29,279
That's bleak

1536
01:19:29,791 --> 01:19:32,095
Yeah yeah

1537
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:33,375
Like a TV Plus

1538
01:19:33,631 --> 01:19:34,143
Like

1539
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:37,727
You got to eat like it was like the guy who's

1540
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:40,031
Been in a firefight

1541
01:19:40,287 --> 01:19:41,311
And he's running away from

1542
01:19:41,567 --> 01:19:46,687
The Constantino's can't go to a real hospital so he has to go to his Veterinary friend who still knows how to stoke

1543
01:19:46,943 --> 01:19:48,479
Pull up and pull the bullet out and

1544
01:19:49,503 --> 01:19:52,063
X-Man I can only trust you like that's what we're living in

1545
01:19:52,319 --> 01:19:54,623
I'm thinking more it's the sort of thing that Alex Wood

1546
01:19:54,879 --> 01:19:55,391
Judge

1547
01:19:55,647 --> 01:19:58,463
Someone in a third world or developing country

1548
01:19:58,719 --> 01:19:59,743
For advocating

1549
01:19:59,999 --> 01:20:01,023
If they

1550
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:02,559
Animal medicine

1551
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:08,703
Yeah it seems like that kind of thing

1552
01:20:08,959 --> 01:20:12,543
So it's kind of tough to see that

1553
01:20:13,055 --> 01:20:15,104
Instantly or just inundated by the shop.

1554
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:17,664
You Take It Outside the context of a being Alex

1555
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:20,736
Bike

1556
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:23,552
Which means it'll be on Fox News

1557
01:20:24,064 --> 01:20:24,832
Hold on

1558
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:27,392
Mike wants to be very clear about this

1559
01:20:27,648 --> 01:20:28,672
He is not

1560
01:20:28,928 --> 01:20:31,488
Recommending you take her medication

1561
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,024
We're not recommending

1562
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:35,072
This for human consumption

1563
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:41,216
I've had people Tech

1564
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:47,104
Paste for horses

1565
01:20:48,384 --> 01:20:50,688
People have

1566
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:53,504
It works a little bucket not recommending it

1567
01:20:55,552 --> 01:20:57,856
Really feels like you're walking that line

1568
01:20:58,112 --> 01:20:58,880
That sucks

1569
01:20:59,136 --> 01:21:00,160
I just want to be

1570
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:03,232
Legally clear 100%

1571
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:09,632
Legally clear I am not recommending you take this miracle drug that I am telling you the Coronavirus

1572
01:21:11,168 --> 01:21:12,448
That I know people

1573
01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:14,496
Who took the horse paste

1574
01:21:14,752 --> 01:21:20,896
But I am not saying peoples

1575
01:21:21,152 --> 01:21:26,784
I really feel like that's the main line they're trying to walk there which is

1576
01:21:28,064 --> 01:21:32,672
So Mike gets into talking about this study a little bit and I don't think

1577
01:21:32,928 --> 01:21:34,720
That he engaged with it well

1578
01:21:35,744 --> 01:21:38,816
Published in antiviral research

1579
01:21:44,704 --> 01:21:45,728
Simian virus

1580
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:49,056
Dengue Fever West Nile Virus Venezuelan

1581
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:51,104
Equine Encephalitis virus

1582
01:21:51,616 --> 01:21:52,128
Influenza

1583
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:53,920
Anybody pseudo rabies

1584
01:21:54,176 --> 01:21:54,688
Virus

1585
01:21:54,944 --> 01:21:55,968
And this is available right

1586
01:21:56,224 --> 01:21:58,272
I am not recommending

1587
01:21:58,784 --> 01:22:00,320
Not for the coronavirus yet

1588
01:22:00,576 --> 01:22:03,904
So this study doesn't show any of those things that Mike is claiming

1589
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:10,304
It references other studies that indicated for Ivermectin as a broad-spectrum antiviral

1590
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:11,840
Mike is really over selling this

1591
01:22:12,864 --> 01:22:14,656
Also as it relates to dinghy

1592
01:22:14,912 --> 01:22:21,056
Study literally says Ivermectin was the focus of a recent phase 3 clinical trial and Dengue

1593
01:22:21,312 --> 01:22:22,336
Patience in Thailand

1594
01:22:22,592 --> 01:22:26,176
In which a single single daily dose was found to be safe

1595
01:22:26,432 --> 01:22:27,200
But not produce

1596
01:22:27,456 --> 01:22:28,992
Any clinical benefit

1597
01:22:29,504 --> 01:22:31,808
Maybe something worthwhile here

1598
01:22:32,064 --> 01:22:33,856
Information that's available

1599
01:22:34,112 --> 01:22:34,624
Kind of talk

1600
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:37,952
From someone pretending to be a health Ranger is f****** premature

1601
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:39,232
This is

1602
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:41,024
Dear overhyping this

1603
01:22:42,304 --> 01:22:42,816
Except it's just

1604
01:22:43,072 --> 01:22:43,840
Deepa irresponsible

1605
01:22:44,096 --> 01:22:46,656
Listen I am not going to I am saying

1606
01:22:46,912 --> 01:22:49,984
You should not take this drug don't take the horse

1607
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:51,008
Dengue figure

1608
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:54,592
That cures coronavirus Coronavirus

1609
01:22:54,848 --> 01:22:59,712
Pedicures to do rabies

1610
01:23:00,224 --> 01:23:01,504
White over it

1611
01:23:02,016 --> 01:23:02,528
Polio

1612
01:23:02,784 --> 01:23:03,552
I'm not saying that you

1613
01:23:03,808 --> 01:23:04,576
Not rabies

1614
01:23:04,832 --> 01:23:06,368
Sudo rabies

1615
01:23:06,624 --> 01:23:07,392
I'm not recommending

1616
01:23:07,648 --> 01:23:08,416
Franklin

1617
01:23:08,672 --> 01:23:10,976
I think it would be responsible for somebody to say you should

1618
01:23:13,792 --> 01:23:17,120
Bing bing bing bing

1619
01:23:17,376 --> 01:23:18,400
Oh man that's crazy

1620
01:23:18,656 --> 01:23:19,168
That's crazy

1621
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:20,448
I'm not recommend

1622
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:23,520
Take it but this person on my phone definitely

1623
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:24,544
Is real

1624
01:23:25,568 --> 01:23:30,432
So Alex seems to think that what's going on is that the media doesn't like

1625
01:23:30,688 --> 01:23:32,224
People taking

1626
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:33,760
Things off label

1627
01:23:34,272 --> 01:23:37,600
Right like whatever the drug is they don't like you using drugs

1628
01:23:37,856 --> 01:23:39,136
It's for different purposes

1629
01:23:39,648 --> 01:23:40,160
Then

1630
01:23:40,416 --> 01:23:41,952
X I thought like everybody

1631
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:43,232
Sure

1632
01:23:43,488 --> 01:23:45,280
I mean b drugs have

1633
01:23:45,536 --> 01:23:49,632
Different uses for Wellbutrin as an antidepressant but itself

1634
01:23:49,888 --> 01:23:52,704
Cessation drug

1635
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:54,496
Issue is

1636
01:23:55,008 --> 01:23:57,312
The thing that people are pushing back

1637
01:23:57,568 --> 01:23:58,592
Against easement

1638
01:23:59,104 --> 01:23:59,616
That like

1639
01:23:59,872 --> 01:24:00,384
This is an author

1640
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:01,408
Label use

1641
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:03,968
Is that there isn't good science that shows

1642
01:24:04,224 --> 01:24:06,016
That this is effective

1643
01:24:06,272 --> 01:24:07,296
And it could hurt

1644
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:09,344
So when the president

1645
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:11,136
Comes out and says what up

1646
01:24:11,904 --> 01:24:14,976
Hey what are you got to lose

1647
01:24:15,232 --> 01:24:18,048
And then the American Medical at everyday

1648
01:24:19,072 --> 01:24:20,096
The living

1649
01:24:20,352 --> 01:24:21,376
You have living Toulouse

1650
01:24:21,632 --> 01:24:22,912
Staffing with the president

1651
01:24:23,168 --> 01:24:26,240
That's what people are responding to not so much of vague

1652
01:24:26,496 --> 01:24:27,264
Concept of

1653
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:32,384
Now he's complained about this is is dumb

1654
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:35,200
Makes it worse is then

1655
01:24:35,456 --> 01:24:39,552
He goes on to name him and might going to name multiple drugs

1656
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:40,576
That are used

1657
01:24:40,832 --> 01:24:41,344
Four different things

1658
01:24:43,136 --> 01:24:45,184
This might work if the Hydroxycut

1659
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:51,584
And doesn't work for a patient this is another Avenue

1660
01:24:57,728 --> 01:25:02,336
What media has been promoting off-label use of all kinds of drugs for for many

1661
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:04,128
Many years.

1662
01:25:04,384 --> 01:25:09,248
That's nothing new to them at what they changing their story now but love them

1663
01:25:10,016 --> 01:25:10,784
30 years

1664
01:25:11,808 --> 01:25:14,368
90s that was a high blood pressure medicine

1665
01:25:14,624 --> 01:25:15,648
Now they'll only grows hair

1666
01:25:16,416 --> 01:25:19,488
Yeah right exactly the little blue pills were

1667
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:21,792
Your first research has a heart truck

1668
01:25:23,072 --> 01:25:24,096
Give men erections so

1669
01:25:24,608 --> 01:25:26,400
They changed it to use their as well

1670
01:25:26,912 --> 01:25:27,936
Yeah but here's the thing

1671
01:25:28,192 --> 01:25:32,032
Each of those cases that you're talkin about didn't get changed just on a whim

1672
01:25:32,288 --> 01:25:35,616
Dover trials done

1673
01:25:35,872 --> 01:25:38,944
I remember the 90s Clinton specifically came out and he's like

1674
01:25:39,456 --> 01:25:45,600
I don't know you guys what Boulders give it a shot why not we got to lose

1675
01:25:45,856 --> 01:25:47,136
Exactly what

1676
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:49,696
The difference is the process

1677
01:25:49,952 --> 01:25:50,976
The process is very important

1678
01:25:51,232 --> 01:25:51,744
Because

1679
01:25:52,512 --> 01:25:55,072
If we didn't have that process therapy people taking off

1680
01:25:55,328 --> 01:25:58,144
The fuk up things it will kill you and don't actually work

1681
01:25:58,656 --> 01:25:59,168
Which is why

1682
01:26:00,192 --> 01:26:01,216
Mike Derrick Mike

1683
01:26:01,472 --> 01:26:04,544
Ebola cure Adams want to do

1684
01:26:05,056 --> 01:26:06,592
Right

1685
01:26:07,104 --> 01:26:07,872
Really scary

1686
01:26:08,128 --> 01:26:12,736
Level of thinking is really f****** scary

1687
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:18,624
The reason is really scary is because those examples they come up with their like

1688
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:20,416
Is that always works

1689
01:26:20,672 --> 01:26:21,184
You're on

1690
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:22,720
Those things

1691
01:26:23,744 --> 01:26:25,024
Process

1692
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:27,840
Did people you're mad at right now are

1693
01:26:28,352 --> 01:26:29,632
That's their point

1694
01:26:30,144 --> 01:26:31,168
Like it wouldn't

1695
01:26:31,936 --> 01:26:33,728
Rogaine wouldn't be used

1696
01:26:33,984 --> 01:26:35,264
They will grow hair

1697
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:36,544
If there weren't

1698
01:26:37,056 --> 01:26:39,616
You know like people who

1699
01:26:39,872 --> 01:26:42,432
Try it out there to see

1700
01:26:42,688 --> 01:26:43,200
Yeah

1701
01:26:43,968 --> 01:26:46,016
It's just such to stupid

1702
01:26:47,552 --> 01:26:49,600
Can you not their children

1703
01:26:50,624 --> 01:26:52,928
So we have these now

1704
01:26:53,952 --> 01:26:54,720
Launch a treat

1705
01:26:55,232 --> 01:26:56,512
Hydrochloric

1706
01:26:56,768 --> 01:26:58,304
We got Ivermectin

1707
01:27:00,352 --> 01:27:01,632
So we don't need

1708
01:27:01,888 --> 01:27:05,216
Listen to the demand

1709
01:27:05,728 --> 01:27:06,496
This effect is that

1710
01:27:06,752 --> 01:27:07,264
Blocks

1711
01:27:07,776 --> 01:27:08,544

1713
01:27:13,664 --> 01:27:15,968

And if they give you a vaccine

1717
01:27:30,304 --> 01:27:31,840
F****** run

1718
01:27:32,096 --> 01:27:33,888
You get away from them and you takes

Hold up and go back to

1723

To work at the same time get some mud dog heartworm medication and

1724
01:27:47,456 --> 01:27:48,224

So you fell into a little bit of a trap there that exist I'm very to

1727
01:27:53,088 --> 01:27:55,904
Disappointing and that is that you thought that stars Cove

1728
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:57,696
Was until the Coronavirus

1729
01:27:57,952 --> 01:27:59,744
I didn't realize that code to was

1730
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:04,608
POV in the middle of it is Coronavirus 2

1731
01:28:04,864 --> 01:28:10,752
One of the names of the eye

1732
01:28:12,544 --> 01:28:14,336
I'm fine with their the same thing

1733
01:28:14,592 --> 01:28:16,128
But Alex

1734
01:28:16,384 --> 01:28:17,920
Doesn't quite get that as well

1735
01:28:18,176 --> 01:28:19,456
You and Alex might be in the same time

1736
01:28:19,968 --> 01:28:22,016
Thank you

1740
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,024
That you're laying to

1741
01:28:39,424 --> 01:28:45,568
Are the study is about thesaurus coronavirus too and now it's saying it's in the virus

1742
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:47,872
The same it is named covid-19

1743
01:28:48,384 --> 01:28:49,408
We're talking about

1744
01:28:49,664 --> 01:28:50,176
Just using a

01:28:59,136 --> 01:29:00,416
Like no that is the same virus

1750
01:29:00,672 --> 01:29:02,720
And so Alex tries to cover for not knowing

1751
01:29:02,976 --> 01:29:04,512
He tried to pretend

1752
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:07,328
Well you know I I I

1753
01:29:08,096 --> 01:29:10,144

1762
01:29:33,696 --> 01:29:38,048
What happened many years ago was the SARS outbreak

1763
01:29:38,304 --> 01:29:40,352
People don't get that

1764
01:29:40,608 --> 01:29:42,656
Original name is SARS

1765
01:29:43,168 --> 01:29:44,960
Dash covid-19

1766
01:29:45,472 --> 01:29:47,776
Trying to really cover for not knowing it

1767
01:29:48,032 --> 01:29:54,176
As opposed to you owning up to like realizes that I have absolutely no problem being in the same

1768
01:29:54,432 --> 01:29:55,712
Boat as even Alex

1769
01:29:55,968 --> 01:29:56,992
In not knowing some

1770
01:29:58,016 --> 01:29:59,808
If I was a in

1771
01:30:00,064 --> 01:30:03,136
The same boat is Alex in denying that I didn't know something

1772
01:30:03,392 --> 01:30:04,672
Then I have a very serious

1773
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:09,792
I mean it's unfortunate that you didn't realize at the same time

1774
01:30:10,048 --> 01:30:13,632
Is a nice moment of the differences reaction

1775
01:30:13,888 --> 01:30:18,752
I just threatened by cool

1776
01:30:19,264 --> 01:30:19,776
Great

1777
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:23,360
Wrong to Alex does

1778
01:30:23,872 --> 01:30:24,384
He does

1779
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:25,152
Is it real

1780
01:30:25,408 --> 01:30:27,456
You really is trying cover for it that's great

1781
01:30:29,504 --> 01:30:30,016

01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:35,392
No

1785

Body in order

1799
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:05,600
Does that mean we just got this

1800
01:31:05,856 --> 01:31:06,880
This this inundation

1801
01:31:07,648 --> 01:31:08,672
This guy is Trump

1802
01:31:08,928 --> 01:31:09,440
Anime

1803
01:31:10,208 --> 01:31:12,000
I'm confused as to what the game is

1804
01:31:13,024 --> 01:31:14,304
I mean this

1805
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:15,328
This seems alike

1806
01:31:15,584 --> 01:31:18,400
We will taking a harsh pivot towards this being

1807
01:31:18,656 --> 01:31:19,680
Primarily an ant

1808
01:31:19,936 --> 01:31:20,448
Evax

1809
01:31:20,704 --> 01:31:22,496
Yeah yeah yeah

1810
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:27,872
You just give they just can't put it at

1811
01:31:28,128 --> 01:31:29,152
Fair enough fair enough

1812
01:31:29,664 --> 01:31:31,968
They just can't put it aside for like 5 Seconds

1813
01:31:32,736 --> 01:31:34,016
Like it doesn't it seems like

1814
01:31:34,272 --> 01:31:36,064
Told you you and the bestie

1815
01:31:36,832 --> 01:31:42,976
With the expertise he has and the limitations that he's dealing but he's not he's not perfectly in line with Trump

1816
01:31:43,232 --> 01:31:44,512
Bulshit so he's a threat

1817
01:31:44,768 --> 01:31:46,048
User anime

1818
01:31:46,304 --> 01:31:47,840
But that seems so stupid

1819
01:31:48,352 --> 01:31:49,888
It does

1820
01:31:50,144 --> 01:31:50,656
Just

1821
01:31:51,424 --> 01:31:51,936
Well

1822
01:31:52,192 --> 01:31:57,568
I mean it's exactly what you should expect based on right last couple years that we've been

1823
01:31:57,824 --> 01:32:00,384
It seems like you should like you would imagine it like

1824
01:32:01,408 --> 01:32:07,552
From all the stuff we've seen they just be like okay look f****** around for a long time sorry about that book this is serious now

1825
01:32:08,576 --> 01:32:11,904
I were or find a way to keep the business profitable while like

1826
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:13,952
Not being

1827
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:15,488
Yeah

1828
01:32:16,512 --> 01:32:18,304
Jeopardizing of people's house

1829
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:20,096
Yeah I know this is this

1830
01:32:20,352 --> 01:32:26,496
This is that thing we know things are the anime Kill the smart one and it is like

1831
01:32:27,008 --> 01:32:27,776
People who are

1832
01:32:28,032 --> 01:32:29,056
Of the opinion that

1833
01:32:29,312 --> 01:32:30,592
I like all all it will take

1834
01:32:30,848 --> 01:32:31,616
For Humanity really come

1835
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:33,408
The threat outside of

1836
01:32:33,664 --> 01:32:34,176
If Humanity that

1837
01:32:34,432 --> 01:32:35,200
We can all unite around

1838
01:32:35,712 --> 01:32:36,480
Sounds like no

1839
01:32:36,736 --> 01:32:37,504
Alex Jones will be like

1840
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:38,272
1

1841
01:32:38,528 --> 01:32:44,672
Independence Day is bulshit there are no aliens sure you saw the White House blow up the white house blew up on it

1842
01:32:45,696 --> 01:32:46,976
And it's just like know it

1843
01:32:47,232 --> 01:32:53,376
These people are daily and they're working with the globalists and they're just trying to scare you saw the glow

1844
01:32:53,632 --> 01:32:59,264
You to bring in martial law they tell you that aliens are running around so you shouldn't leave your house

1845
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:00,544
That's just because

1846
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:02,336
They don't want you to leave your house

1847
01:33:02,592 --> 01:33:03,872
Will Smith was born in Kenya

1848
01:33:04,128 --> 01:33:05,152
Like whatever

1849
01:33:05,408 --> 01:33:08,224
You guys are going to try and kill the human race who matter what

1850
01:33:08,736 --> 01:33:10,272
Yeah it is really a bummer

1851
01:33:10,528 --> 01:33:11,808
Yeah it is it is

1852
01:33:12,832 --> 01:33:14,880
A lot of the primary

1853
01:33:15,136 --> 01:33:17,696
Directions that this seems to be going on this episode

1854
01:33:18,208 --> 01:33:22,304
Obviously anti-vaccination narratives have gone throughout like Alex

1855
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:23,072
The fear of

1856
01:33:23,328 --> 01:33:24,608
Imagine forced

1857
01:33:24,864 --> 01:33:25,888
Received

1858
01:33:27,168 --> 01:33:29,472
But seems like that's becoming a bit more primer

1859
01:33:31,264 --> 01:33:32,032
Also

1860
01:33:33,056 --> 01:33:33,568
You know

1861
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:36,128
The idea of killing off everybody through a

1862
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:42,784
World War also seems like it might be in Alex's wheelhouse movie about

1863
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:43,808
That this next clip

1864
01:33:44,064 --> 01:33:44,576
Alex's

1865
01:33:44,832 --> 01:33:45,856
Trying to start a world

1866
01:33:46,112 --> 01:33:46,624
Okay

1867
01:33:47,648 --> 01:33:49,696
I predicted this in early February

1868
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:50,720
Support the virus

1869
01:33:51,232 --> 01:33:52,256
In fact is many other

1870
01:33:52,512 --> 01:33:53,024
Countries is

1871
01:33:53,536 --> 01:33:54,816
So they can shift the blame away from China

1872
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:56,608
What happened

1873
01:33:57,632 --> 01:33:59,424
They're just trying to make sure they can rewrite history

1874
01:34:00,192 --> 01:34:00,960
Trump

1875
01:34:01,472 --> 01:34:01,984
Instead of

1876
01:34:03,264 --> 01:34:03,776
Incompetent

1877
01:34:04,032 --> 01:34:07,104
Videos of Chinese trying to spread

1878
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:08,128
What the hell

1879
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:16,064
Again it's the anti-American hatred that's been put in place

1880
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:16,832
Because China

1881
01:34:19,136 --> 01:34:20,416
Is what proceed War

1882
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:24,256
The United States in more ways

1883
01:34:25,792 --> 01:34:26,304
Weapon

1884
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:27,072
I've been writing about

1885
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:29,120
That recently as well there more attacks coming

1886
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:31,424
Kind of the big news right now

1887
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:32,448
People better be ready

1888
01:34:33,984 --> 01:34:34,752
Worse

1889
01:34:35,776 --> 01:34:37,312
We're at war with communist China

1890
01:34:42,944 --> 01:34:43,456
When is the

1891
01:34:43,712 --> 01:34:44,224
The time to

1892
01:34:44,992 --> 01:34:51,136
Yeah we already look way back predicted a ground invasion of the United States showing China's over him

1893
01:34:53,184 --> 01:34:53,696
Been terrified

1894
01:34:53,952 --> 01:34:57,792
This is all kind of in the same vein as some of the other b*******

1895
01:34:58,048 --> 01:34:58,816
He's been saying but like

1896
01:34:59,584 --> 01:35:01,120
Due to a point where Alex is

1897
01:35:01,376 --> 01:35:01,888
Like

1898
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:02,912
What are you doing

1899
01:35:03,168 --> 01:35:03,936
What are you doing

1900
01:35:04,192 --> 01:35:06,240
Advocating for a world war with China

1901
01:35:06,496 --> 01:35:10,336
Yeah it's just like going to be no big deal

1902
01:35:10,592 --> 01:35:11,616
Do you think I

1903
01:35:12,384 --> 01:35:18,528
China doesn't also have allies you think the brics countries aren't all basically going to formula

1904
01:35:18,784 --> 01:35:24,928
Let's not do this again damn it's good versus evil we don't need to worry about the world getting involved

1905
01:35:25,184 --> 01:35:28,000
Everybody's going to stay out of the way it's going to be like a 10

1906
01:35:28,256 --> 01:35:29,024
Going to be like a

1907
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:31,584
Achilles vs Hector

1908
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:34,400
Scituate America vs. China

1909
01:35:34,656 --> 01:35:38,240
Get him in the ring one-night-only we're going to solve this whole problem

1910
01:35:38,752 --> 01:35:39,776
No it'll be like

1911
01:35:40,032 --> 01:35:46,176
The fiend vs. John Cena

1912
01:35:46,432 --> 01:35:47,968
Nation of America Vigo

1913
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:49,504
God that needs

1914
01:35:50,272 --> 01:35:50,784
Re-read pretty hard

1915
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:51,552
I just

1916
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:53,088
I think it is

1917
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:54,368
Is so

1918
01:35:54,624 --> 01:36:00,768
I think it's I think it's really irresponsible I don't obviously don't think it's going to lead to a World War

1919
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:05,376
In terms of the rhetoric that he's putting forth I keep getting to that point where it's like well

1920
01:36:05,632 --> 01:36:07,168
What you seem to want

1921
01:36:07,424 --> 01:36:07,936
To happen

1922
01:36:08,192 --> 01:36:08,960
Is that

1923
01:36:09,216 --> 01:36:10,240
You seem to want

1924
01:36:10,496 --> 01:36:11,520
Circumstance

1925
01:36:11,776 --> 01:36:13,056
Is that would lead to

1926
01:36:13,312 --> 01:36:14,336
No other option

1927
01:36:14,592 --> 01:36:15,104
Then

1928
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:16,384
Open War

1929
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:17,920
Between the United States

1930
01:36:18,176 --> 01:36:18,688
And China

1931
01:36:18,944 --> 01:36:19,456
And

1932
01:36:19,712 --> 01:36:20,224
That is a

1933
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:20,992
The hellscape

1934
01:36:21,504 --> 01:36:22,272
That is something

1935
01:36:22,528 --> 01:36:25,600
I can't imagine anybody wanting even someone who hates China

1936
01:36:25,856 --> 01:36:27,136
I can't imagine the morning

1937
01:36:27,648 --> 01:36:29,696
Here are the options that

1938
01:36:31,744 --> 01:36:32,256
Has tide

1939
01:36:33,024 --> 01:36:34,048
Provided us an issue

1940
01:36:34,816 --> 01:36:35,584
There is

1941
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:36,864
Global cooperation

1942
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:40,960
Between all of these countries Satanist try and destroy

1943
01:36:41,216 --> 01:36:41,984
To try and overcome

1944
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:42,752
Combee

1945
01:36:43,008 --> 01:36:45,056
Sars-cov 2 virus

1946
01:36:46,336 --> 01:36:47,360
Thank you

1947
01:36:50,432 --> 01:36:51,968
Global World War

1948
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:53,504
Killing

1949
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:55,040
An exponentially

1950
01:36:55,296 --> 01:36:56,832
Greater number of people

1951
01:36:57,088 --> 01:36:59,136
For the sake of life

1952
01:36:59,648 --> 01:37:02,464
Ultimate irony to is that like what

1953
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:06,560
He seems to want or the path that he

1954
01:37:07,072 --> 01:37:09,120
His rhetoric takes you down is much

1955
01:37:09,376 --> 01:37:15,520
Closer to that lockstep scenario is in the Rockefeller

1956
01:37:15,776 --> 01:37:20,640
Is nation-states becoming even further insight

1957
01:37:20,896 --> 01:37:22,176
Autocratic

1958
01:37:22,432 --> 01:37:26,528
At work

1959
01:37:29,344 --> 01:37:35,232
Response that is the summation of his entire career as we've learned in the past

1960
01:37:35,488 --> 01:37:36,000
3 years

1961
01:37:36,256 --> 01:37:38,048
Is scaring people in

1962
01:37:38,304 --> 01:37:39,072
Terrifying them

1963
01:37:39,328 --> 01:37:40,352
Something so much

1964
01:37:40,864 --> 01:37:41,376
That they work

1965
01:37:41,632 --> 01:37:42,144
To bring it about

1966
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:44,448
Maybe unintentionally

1967
01:37:44,704 --> 01:37:48,032
I don't know what that was

1968
01:37:48,288 --> 01:37:50,080
Oh I'm so terrified of addicts

1969
01:37:50,336 --> 01:37:52,640
Tater out of a tyrant of all of this s*** and

1970
01:37:52,896 --> 01:37:54,432
Thank God we can elect Trump

1971
01:37:54,688 --> 01:37:55,456
To stop that

1972
01:37:55,712 --> 01:37:56,992
Suspend all election

1973
01:37:57,248 --> 01:37:59,808
Enterprise voters into all of his other shoe

1974
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:00,832
Near like

1975
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:06,720
Are you f****** with me was this a huge reverse psychology situation the whole time

1976
01:38:06,976 --> 01:38:07,488
Dido

1977
01:38:07,744 --> 01:38:08,256
Now I doubt it

1978

Lyrics to stupid

1979
01:38:10,048 --> 01:38:11,584
So speaking of people are stupid

Text Mike

1981

Fox bathtub

1982
01:38:15,424 --> 01:38:16,960
College

1983
01:38:17,728 --> 01:38:20,032
Supposed to be in the context of his

1984
01:38:20,288 --> 01:38:23,360
He wants to make about 5G

1985
01:38:23,616 --> 01:38:24,128
Oh I was hoping

1986
01:38:24,384 --> 01:38:24,896
Is the movie pork

1987
01:38:25,408 --> 01:38:25,920
No

1988
01:38:26,176 --> 01:38:27,968
I don't report

1989
01:38:28,224 --> 01:38:30,784
He's perfectly well but there might be seeing similar

1990
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:32,064
Probably not

1991
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:34,624
5G Tower

1992
01:38:35,136 --> 01:38:39,232
His point is that 5G set you up

1993
01:38:39,488 --> 01:38:40,768
To get Coronavirus

1994
01:38:41,024 --> 01:38:42,048
Because the

1995
01:38:42,816 --> 01:38:47,936
The way is it it electrifies your blood or something it makes the cells

1996
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:52,032
Calibre the virus

1997
01:38:52,544 --> 01:38:54,336
Wendy's this is the same

1998
01:38:54,848 --> 01:38:56,384
As when he was in college

1999
01:38:56,896 --> 01:38:59,200
Okay and his buddies would lick batteries

2000
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:01,248
Drunk faster

2001
01:39:02,016 --> 01:39:02,528
By the way

2002
01:39:02,784 --> 01:39:04,576
This is the health Ranger

2003
01:39:05,088 --> 01:39:05,856
I know people

2004
01:39:06,112 --> 01:39:07,392
It went out back in town with you with

2005
01:39:07,904 --> 01:39:09,952
Drink alcohol and they would get drunk

2006
01:39:10,208 --> 01:39:13,536
By having a voltage pass through their fingers they would hold

2007
01:39:13,792 --> 01:39:14,816
Battery leads

2008
01:39:15,072 --> 01:39:17,376
Alcoholic

2009
01:39:17,632 --> 01:39:19,424
5 times more effective there actually get drunk

2010
01:39:19,936 --> 01:39:23,264
Due to the electoral process

2011
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:28,128
Yes pushing the alcohol into sells it it makes you more drunk

2012
01:39:30,176 --> 01:39:36,320
Yeah man this is like when I used to hang out with the bus potheads and collagen there's a God you got to cost to get off man haha

2013
01:39:38,112 --> 01:39:40,160
The bong and you're not really getting high

2014
01:39:40,672 --> 01:39:44,000
That reminds me of a I don't know if you saw this press conference

2015
01:39:44,512 --> 01:39:45,280
This one was

2016
01:39:46,048 --> 01:39:46,816
Not his wife

2017
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:48,864
Dr. fauci

2018
01:39:49,376 --> 01:39:50,656
You should not take

2019
01:39:50,912 --> 01:39:52,192
Hydrochloric win

2020
01:39:52,448 --> 01:39:52,960
Just yet

2021
01:39:53,472 --> 01:39:56,032
Because we don't have all the evidence

2022
01:39:56,288 --> 01:39:58,080
Think about it in the same way that when I was in

2023
01:39:58,336 --> 01:40:01,920
College we used to butt chug and it didn't turn out that made us get drunk

2024
01:40:02,944 --> 01:40:04,480
So I think

2025
01:40:04,736 --> 01:40:09,600
Strongly disagree I saw in the Lancet

2026
01:40:11,648 --> 01:40:13,440
God

2027
01:40:13,696 --> 01:40:15,488
Yeah boy

2028
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:16,512
Not good

2029
01:40:16,768 --> 01:40:18,816
I really think that

2030
01:40:19,328 --> 01:40:20,352
College drink

2031
01:40:20,608 --> 01:40:21,376
Making short stories

2032
01:40:21,632 --> 01:40:22,400
You shouldn't need a base

2033
01:40:22,656 --> 01:40:24,960
Cases for a lot of Health decision

2034
01:40:25,216 --> 01:40:31,360
Battery

2035
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:33,920
But if you really want

2036
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:40,832
I don't know if there's any truth to this but I tried to look into it and I did not find any evidence

2037
01:40:41,344 --> 01:40:43,648
Electrifying

2038
01:40:43,904 --> 01:40:50,048
Voltage makes you drunk faster

2039
01:40:50,304 --> 01:40:52,352
Nobody was even testing for whether or not

2040
01:40:52,608 --> 01:40:54,144
Licking batteries will get you drunk fast

2041
01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:58,496
Some dumb thing that you said

2042
01:40:59,008 --> 01:40:59,520
Yeah

2043
01:40:59,776 --> 01:41:04,384
So it is next clip Mike says something else stupid but it's all that is fun stupid

2044
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:05,920
This is more paranoid stupid

2045
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:12,320
Blood draws by the way this what governor Abbott announced for Texas you know when they test your antibodies they're going to

2046
01:41:12,832 --> 01:41:14,368
Track your DNA to so this is

2047
01:41:15,136 --> 01:41:16,672
Lost our way to just secretly

2048
01:41:16,928 --> 01:41:18,464
Steal everybody's DNA

2049
01:41:18,976 --> 01:41:20,768
Permission same thing with the nasal swab

2050
01:41:21,536 --> 01:41:22,816
Get a little bit of virus on that

2051
01:41:23,072 --> 01:41:25,376
On that nasal swab that deep cavity swap

2052
01:41:25,632 --> 01:41:26,912
Also getting your DNA

2053
01:41:27,168 --> 01:41:28,960
This is a way to create a DNA

2054
01:41:30,752 --> 01:41:31,776
That's why I'm not going to get

2055
01:41:32,288 --> 01:41:36,128
I'm not going to get an antibody test I don't want the government have my DNA

2056
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:39,200
So now they're trying to make everyone scared of

2057
01:41:39,456 --> 01:41:43,296
Traffic contaminated test narrative

2058
01:41:43,552 --> 01:41:44,832
Curiously absent

2059
01:41:45,344 --> 01:41:47,392
This episode

2060
01:41:47,648 --> 01:41:48,416
In the

2061
01:41:48,672 --> 01:41:49,184
Days

2062
01:41:49,696 --> 01:41:51,232
Couple days since then but

2063
01:41:51,488 --> 01:41:55,584
Yeah crying about China sending out contaminated tests and now is

2064
01:41:56,096 --> 01:42:02,240
Not even bring it up at all which is super suspicious everyone scared because they're going to take your tea

2065
01:42:02,496 --> 01:42:03,776
DNA and put it in a database

2066
01:42:04,032 --> 01:42:08,896
Do not think that any time you've gotten any kind of blood drawn or anyting

2067
01:42:09,152 --> 01:42:11,968
They could do that if that was the intention

2068
01:42:12,224 --> 01:42:13,760
Nope goddamnit just

2069
01:42:14,272 --> 01:42:17,856
I'm at I'm at the place now where it's like such an unreasonable paranoia

2070
01:42:18,112 --> 01:42:18,880
You idiot

2071
01:42:19,136 --> 01:42:19,648
Bike

2072
01:42:19,904 --> 01:42:20,416
Alex

2073
01:42:20,672 --> 01:42:21,184
Trump

2074
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:21,952
Whomever

2075
01:42:22,464 --> 01:42:25,280
Contract covid and then curette or shut the

2076
01:42:25,792 --> 01:42:26,304
I'm done

2077
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:32,704
I'm done with all these lies about what cures Bully from Mike Adams

2078
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:33,472
Did it

2079
01:42:33,728 --> 01:42:34,240
Great

2080
01:42:34,496 --> 01:42:36,544
I got them give somebody else Coronavirus

2081
01:42:37,056 --> 01:42:38,592
And ends up becoming

2082
01:42:39,104 --> 01:42:41,920
The E test on himself

2083
01:42:42,176 --> 01:42:48,320
Penicillin and malaria situation that he does the whole thing

2084
01:42:48,576 --> 01:42:52,416
Can infect his son and tourism in front of the Nobel Prize can

2085
01:42:52,672 --> 01:42:54,976
Becomes a hero for the ages

2086
01:42:55,232 --> 01:42:56,256
Good

2087
01:42:56,512 --> 01:43:00,352
He's a guy telling you to take cow medicine

2088
01:43:00,864 --> 01:43:01,888
Yeah f******

2089
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:04,448
Put up or shut up I'm done with this

2090
01:43:04,704 --> 01:43:05,472
Bulshit

2091
01:43:05,728 --> 01:43:09,312
So the two of them here talk about this is the last sort of thing that they have

2092
01:43:09,568 --> 01:43:10,592
Together

2093
01:43:10,848 --> 01:43:16,224
And that is actually kind of interesting

2094
01:43:16,736 --> 01:43:17,504
Because

2095
01:43:18,016 --> 01:43:20,064
It doesn't belong on Infowars

2096
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:22,880
It can be used by Infowars

2097
01:43:23,392 --> 01:43:24,928
Talk about this little bit

2098
01:43:25,184 --> 01:43:26,464
And he's just

2099
01:43:28,512 --> 01:43:31,328
I got a thank you so much we come back here going to be gone but

2100
01:43:31,584 --> 01:43:34,400
I looked it up

2101
01:43:34,656 --> 01:43:37,728
Bombshell play from.nyc ICU doctor coven

2102
01:43:39,264 --> 01:43:40,544
Suboxone deprivation not

2103
01:43:41,312 --> 01:43:42,592
That one minute

2104
01:43:43,616 --> 01:43:44,640
I'm coming up with this because

2105
01:43:45,664 --> 01:43:46,688
The distance is not ammonia

2106
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:49,760
Very important story this Emergency Physician

2107
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:55,392
The ventilators are causing the lung damage of the running the wrong methods that

2108
01:43:56,928 --> 01:44:00,000
The dogma of the medical system is thinking that this is viral pneumonia

2109
01:44:00,256 --> 01:44:02,816
It isn't viral pneumonia it's oxygen deprivation

2110
01:44:03,072 --> 01:44:05,376
And that Emergency Physician knows exactly what

2111
01:44:05,632 --> 01:44:06,144
He's talking about

2112
01:44:06,656 --> 01:44:07,936
That lungs are being damaged

2113
01:44:12,288 --> 01:44:14,080
I need a bit higher oxygen mix

2114
01:44:15,616 --> 01:44:20,224
Different method with lower pressure and just support the lungs absorbing oxygen not take over the lungs

2115
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:23,808
With higher pressure that causes tissue damage

2116
01:44:25,344 --> 01:44:29,184
We're going to play with the doctor said I'm sure the left

2117
01:44:37,376 --> 01:44:40,704
So this doctor in question is a guy named Cameron kyle-sidell

2118
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:45,824
Put out YouTube video claiming that he seen things that indicate that this is not an ammonia like

2119
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:47,616
Disease and its recommendations

2120
01:44:47,872 --> 01:44:49,152
Changing the settings on the vent

2121
01:44:50,688 --> 01:44:55,552
I'm not sure if it is good data to back this up but Alex's comment at the end there is really stupid

2122
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:59,136
Like there is an article in like a New York Post

2123
01:44:59,392 --> 01:45:02,720
Another art Outlets about this guy's video and he's bringing

2124
01:45:02,976 --> 01:45:03,488
To the table

2125
01:45:03,744 --> 01:45:08,352
Discussing he's there a possibility that there is a better treatment than

2126
01:45:08,608 --> 01:45:09,632
What we've been using

2127
01:45:10,144 --> 01:45:11,424
It's an interesting Prospect

2128
01:45:11,936 --> 01:45:12,960
But Alex things

2129
01:45:13,216 --> 01:45:15,008
This dude's going to get a ton of pushback

2130
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:17,312
Because Alex gets a ton of pushback

2131
01:45:17,568 --> 01:45:19,360
For his irresponsible share

2132
01:45:19,872 --> 01:45:22,944
I don't know what to make of this doctor and what he

2133
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:24,224
Please bring to the table I don't know

2134
01:45:24,736 --> 01:45:26,016
I can't possibly know

2135
01:45:26,528 --> 01:45:29,088
But the response that I've seen from

2136
01:45:29,344 --> 01:45:31,392
Not Infowars Outlet

2137
01:45:31,904 --> 01:45:32,672
Isn't like

2138
01:45:33,184 --> 01:45:37,024
F*** this guy because it's not him telling you to take dewormer

2139
01:45:37,792 --> 01:45:38,560
It's so 8

2140
01:45:38,816 --> 01:45:39,584
Someone saying

2141
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:41,632
There's a possibility that there is a better

2142
01:45:41,888 --> 01:45:43,424
Treatment is it

2143
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:44,960
Is there something to this

2144
01:45:45,984 --> 01:45:47,008
I don't know we don't know yet

2145
01:45:48,032 --> 01:45:50,336
But Alex thinks he's going to shut it down

2146
01:45:50,592 --> 01:45:51,104
No

2147
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:52,640
People hate you

2148
01:45:52,896 --> 01:45:55,968
How you say to different Behavior

2149
01:45:56,224 --> 01:45:57,248
Yes absolutely

2150
01:45:57,504 --> 01:46:02,624
Alex says he's going to play that video as he's going to have to break there any comes back

2151
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:03,648
I did not

2152
01:46:04,416 --> 01:46:10,560
Are you sure this is

2153
01:46:10,816 --> 01:46:16,960
Not like other intelligent people don't know what we're talkin about as accurate as they decided

2154
01:46:17,216 --> 01:46:21,056
Decide to join with

2155
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:27,968
Four-legged flattered being offered to be part of the flower

2156
01:46:33,088 --> 01:46:34,880
I've always been sober

2157
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:38,976
Every time I got around to Satanist

2158
01:46:41,536 --> 01:46:42,304
I didn't feel strong

2159
01:46:44,608 --> 01:46:46,912
How much danger I matter how much I may attack

2160
01:46:47,168 --> 01:46:47,680
Stop.

2161
01:46:47,936 --> 01:46:48,704
Discontinued

2162
01:46:49,984 --> 01:46:56,128
He was like an hour ago talk about how people should be maybe exterminated Bill Gates strike of their job

2163
01:46:56,384 --> 01:46:56,896
God

2164
01:46:58,432 --> 01:46:58,944
What a dick

2165
01:46:59,456 --> 01:47:03,808
Also I love you ideas

2166
01:47:06,368 --> 01:47:09,184
Chef

2167
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:10,720
Projecting any of his family

2168
01:47:13,024 --> 01:47:16,096
The other one of the other things too like in terms of

2169
01:47:16,352 --> 01:47:19,424
Friends that I've been seeing a little bit one is the

2170
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:21,472
Flu to cold

2171
01:47:21,728 --> 01:47:22,496
In terms of

2172
01:47:22,752 --> 01:47:25,568
Discussing coronavirus as the cold

2173
01:47:25,824 --> 01:47:27,360
Flu

2174
01:47:27,616 --> 01:47:28,896
Losing a lot lately

2175
01:47:29,152 --> 01:47:31,456
Alex seems to be getting really

2176
01:47:31,712 --> 01:47:33,248
Sucking profit like

2177
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:36,832
Lately talking about how God is speaking through him

2178
01:47:37,088 --> 01:47:40,672
Yeah that kind of thing a bit more in this next clip I think is like

2179
01:47:40,928 --> 01:47:42,464
Really indicative that

2180
01:47:42,976 --> 01:47:43,744
The smarter

2181
01:47:46,048 --> 01:47:46,816
I Gotta Wear Shades

2182
01:47:47,328 --> 01:47:48,864
I'm in control

2183
01:47:49,120 --> 01:47:49,888
What I tell you

2184
01:47:51,168 --> 01:47:51,936
It's not me.

2185
01:47:55,776 --> 01:47:59,104
Yeah until I don't look forward what I'm going to do to make

2186
01:48:00,384 --> 01:48:02,944
Every door that closes other doors open there's profit

2187
01:48:03,200 --> 01:48:04,224
It's a real thing

2188
01:48:06,784 --> 01:48:08,832
My friends and and don't be fearful

2189
01:48:09,344 --> 01:48:10,368
Sodial body

2190
01:48:10,624 --> 01:48:11,904
Are you can kill the soul

2191
01:48:15,744 --> 01:48:17,024
14 weeks

2192
01:48:18,048 --> 01:48:23,424
That'll unreal you were f******

2193
01:48:23,680 --> 01:48:27,008
Dancing around like

2194
01:48:27,264 --> 01:48:30,848
Absolute Banger Avenue delivered

2195
01:48:31,360 --> 01:48:31,872
Friday

2196
01:48:32,128 --> 01:48:38,272
Unreal are not in the room I was doing a bunch of religious poses

2197
01:48:38,528 --> 01:48:40,576
Alex's talking about Providence

2198
01:48:42,112 --> 01:48:43,392
Daddy's

2199
01:48:45,952 --> 01:48:47,232
Gets better

2200
01:48:47,488 --> 01:48:49,024
God speaking through me

2201
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:51,584
I have this Providence

2202
01:48:52,096 --> 01:48:54,400
For a while

2203
01:48:57,984 --> 01:49:00,544
I know you lost your job but you got a tithe

2204
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:05,664
To me you because the Lord deeds and so on and so forth and Paula White Cain

2205
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:06,432
Should be the bread

2206
01:49:06,688 --> 01:49:12,832
Have to assume Jesus would turn over a table and Alex's Studio

2207
01:49:13,088 --> 01:49:14,624
That whole non-violence policy and be like

2208
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:16,672
I really f***** up on this one guy

2209
01:49:18,208 --> 01:49:24,352
I'm going to take care of him and then we'll do the nonviolent confiscate Alex's rifle

2210
01:49:25,888 --> 01:49:32,032
So he doesn't playing that guys video don't get me wrong I realize that I might have made it sound like he doesn't

2211
01:49:32,544 --> 01:49:34,848
But he has no analysis humpback

2212
01:49:35,104 --> 01:49:37,664
Also has no analysis for it it's worthless

2213
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:39,968
Until it just turns into like a bit of a

2214
01:49:40,224 --> 01:49:43,808
Add thing and then he plays it right at the end of the show

2215
01:49:44,064 --> 01:49:45,088
Goes out but

2216
01:49:45,856 --> 01:49:47,648
I have one last clip and it's just

2217
01:49:48,416 --> 01:49:48,928
Like

2218
01:49:49,184 --> 01:49:49,696
Alex

2219
01:49:49,952 --> 01:49:52,512
He's been trying to sell his zinc obvious

2220
01:49:53,536 --> 01:49:54,304
A lady's been doing

2221
01:49:54,816 --> 01:49:57,120
Great well I would say that it's been

2222
01:49:57,376 --> 01:49:58,400
This is even worse

2223
01:49:58,656 --> 01:50:01,216
You seems to be trying to tell his audience like

2224
01:50:01,472 --> 01:50:02,752
Hey look man I don't know

2225
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:04,288
Don't take it for me

2226
01:50:04,544 --> 01:50:06,080
The doctors have been telling me to take

2227
01:50:06,336 --> 01:50:08,384
A dangerous level of zinc

2228
01:50:09,152 --> 01:50:10,176
Sold out everywhere

2229
01:50:10,688 --> 01:50:12,736
People debate about how much zinc should you take

2230
01:50:14,528 --> 01:50:15,040
Today

2231
01:50:17,856 --> 01:50:19,136
100 during this virus

2232
01:50:21,952 --> 01:50:23,744
You have covid-19

2233
01:50:24,768 --> 01:50:26,560
250mg

2234
01:50:31,424 --> 01:50:31,936
Well

2235
01:50:32,704 --> 01:50:33,216
Please

2236
01:50:33,984 --> 01:50:35,264
But he said you know this is so

2237
01:50:40,896 --> 01:50:41,408
Wow

2238
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:45,760
George Soros Bridge breathing down my neck

2239
01:50:47,808 --> 01:50:53,696
That is the great moment right there I've got the George Soros people breathing down my neck I'm not giving me medical advice

2240
01:50:53,952 --> 01:50:58,304
I see if they weren't breathing down his neck he would they take 250 ml

2241
01:50:58,560 --> 01:51:02,144
It's dangerous it's dangerous but doctors are telling me you hate

2242
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:04,192
If you're not giving medical advice

2243
01:51:04,704 --> 01:51:05,728
Don't do that

2244
01:51:05,984 --> 01:51:07,776
Don't have this conversation at all

2245
01:51:08,032 --> 01:51:08,544
Useless

2246
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:10,848
Yeah there is no point to have this conversation

2247
01:51:11,104 --> 01:51:12,128
Outside

2248
01:51:12,640 --> 01:51:14,688
Some sort of insight you're giving your audio

2249
01:51:15,200 --> 01:51:18,272
Yeah and insight that you glean from this as I give you trust

2250
01:51:18,528 --> 01:51:20,064
Alex is a source of information

2251
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:25,952
He's talked to doctors who are like hey look this will cause damage but you should take tons of zinc

2252
01:51:26,464 --> 01:51:28,000
Because this

2253
01:51:29,536 --> 01:51:30,560
Higher

2254
01:51:30,816 --> 01:51:32,352
You think that needed time

2255
01:51:33,376 --> 01:51:34,400
What's up I would be

2256
01:51:34,656 --> 01:51:35,168
Be so much

2257
01:51:35,424 --> 01:51:36,448
I would be so much better

2258
01:51:37,472 --> 01:51:39,008
If all of these people

2259
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:41,056
Continue pedaling their b*******

2260
01:51:41,824 --> 01:51:43,872
Conspiracy theories

2261
01:51:44,896 --> 01:51:45,408
But

2262
01:51:45,664 --> 01:51:47,200
For now the point was like

2263
01:51:47,712 --> 01:51:48,480
Stay home so

2264
01:51:48,736 --> 01:51:50,784
Social distance don't do anything f******

2265
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:51,552
Stupid

2266
01:51:51,808 --> 01:51:52,832
I'd be fine with

2267
01:51:53,088 --> 01:51:54,624
Because at least now we're like

2268
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:59,488
We're just going to do the thing now and then we'll deal with all this s*** later stay home

2269
01:51:59,744 --> 01:52:03,584
But we saved you is aromatherapy

2270
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:04,864
Yeah yeah

2271
01:52:05,120 --> 01:52:08,448
But as long as you stay home it's on for this

2272
01:52:09,984 --> 01:52:10,752
Think you could do that

2273
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:12,800
But I think you could murder

2274
01:52:13,056 --> 01:52:16,896
I think you could busy I think I would be

2275
01:52:17,152 --> 01:52:20,736
Potpourri that helps you relax

2276
01:52:20,992 --> 01:52:25,600
From the virus now that's fine I don't I don't think I would be as offended

2277
01:52:25,856 --> 01:52:28,672
That probably because there would still be like

2278
01:52:28,928 --> 01:52:29,696
Contradiction

2279
01:52:29,952 --> 01:52:30,976
Right

2280
01:52:31,232 --> 01:52:31,744
Wilhelm

2281
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:32,512
Right

2282
01:52:33,024 --> 01:52:35,328
These guys are just now

2283
01:52:35,584 --> 01:52:37,632
Tantamount to a f******

2284
01:52:39,168 --> 01:52:39,680
What

2285
01:52:41,216 --> 01:52:43,264
Manslaughter

2286
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:44,800
Criminal negligence

2287
01:52:45,056 --> 01:52:46,592
I don't know what else

2288
01:52:46,848 --> 01:52:52,736
To describe these be like I don't know how else to describe Trump as as anything other than somebody who's

2289
01:52:52,992 --> 01:52:54,784
Committing maskell murder rate

2290
01:52:55,040 --> 01:52:58,368
Payless

2291
01:52:58,880 --> 01:53:01,696
Well the problem is the law clearly doesn't mean anything anyway

2292
01:53:01,952 --> 01:53:02,976
Milestone

2293
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:05,792
Yeah it's it's stuff

2294
01:53:06,048 --> 01:53:12,192
And what I think I think is really interesting about this episode of particular

2295
01:53:13,216 --> 01:53:19,360
That you have the development of the hydrochloric win narrative into the

2296
01:53:19,616 --> 01:53:20,128
Ivermectin

2297
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:22,432
And

2298
01:53:22,688 --> 01:53:23,456
It's better

2299
01:53:23,968 --> 01:53:24,992
In terms of like

2300
01:53:25,504 --> 01:53:26,784
Some reality

2301
01:53:27,040 --> 01:53:29,344
Right right

2302
01:53:29,856 --> 01:53:31,392
But it's still the same behavior

2303
01:53:31,648 --> 01:53:33,952
Reckless Behavior

2304
01:53:34,208 --> 01:53:35,232
Yeah

2305
01:53:35,488 --> 01:53:36,768
These are these dudes

2306
01:53:37,024 --> 01:53:38,048
To the level of criminal

2307
01:53:38,304 --> 01:53:39,072
Without

2308
01:53:39,328 --> 01:53:40,864
Doubt to the level of criminal

2309
01:53:41,120 --> 01:53:43,168
Regardless of whether or not there is a law that you can

2310
01:53:43,424 --> 01:53:44,960
Can use your ports at this is

2311
01:53:45,216 --> 01:53:47,776
Cry now Jordan what pisses me off the most

2312
01:53:49,056 --> 01:53:51,360
They didn't talk about you

2313
01:53:51,872 --> 01:53:52,896
Well that's tomorrow

2314
01:53:53,152 --> 01:53:54,688
I understand. Today is your listening

2315
01:53:55,968 --> 01:53:58,016
I understand but I wanted like

2316
01:53:59,040 --> 01:54:03,392
If you are building to a pay-per-view in wrestling

2317
01:54:04,160 --> 01:54:08,256
It's not like you're going to not talk about the fight your now you pretend it doesn't happen

2318
01:54:09,280 --> 01:54:11,072
This is Alex

2319
01:54:11,328 --> 01:54:12,608
Called qanon out

2320
01:54:12,864 --> 01:54:17,472
A week ago and he has done almost nothing on his show

2321
01:54:17,728 --> 01:54:19,520
In terms of like building the feud

2322
01:54:20,032 --> 01:54:20,544
Because

2323
01:54:21,056 --> 01:54:23,616
Pinky realizes is going to be a butt

2324
01:54:23,872 --> 01:54:24,384
I am going

2325
01:54:24,640 --> 01:54:25,664
To lap up your Des

2326
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:26,688
Disappointment like

2327
01:54:26,944 --> 01:54:27,456
Ambrosia

2328
01:54:28,224 --> 01:54:29,248
What hurry hurry

2329
01:54:29,504 --> 01:54:30,784
I bet none of that is going to

2330
01:54:31,040 --> 01:54:36,160
I just going to be fantastic excited for it

2331
01:54:36,928 --> 01:54:43,072
Don't think you get some sort of schadenfreude out of it not at all

2332
01:54:43,328 --> 01:54:43,840
To be delicious

2333
01:54:44,096 --> 01:54:44,608
Snapped

2334
01:54:45,120 --> 01:54:46,912
We will see and talk back

2335
01:54:47,168 --> 01:54:53,056
Next episode where we will do you with Alex's

2336
01:54:53,312 --> 01:54:58,944
Until then

2337
01:54:59,456 --> 01:55:05,600
Yes we are on Facebook

2338
01:55:05,856 --> 01:55:09,696
Don't do the whole thing thank you very much opening arguments bring designers

2339
01:55:10,208 --> 01:55:13,792
Until then I'm Neo I'm Leon dzx Clark

2340
01:55:14,048 --> 01:55:15,840

2341
01:55:20,448 --> 01:55:21,216
Alex

2342
01:55:21,728 --> 01:55:24,032
In color
