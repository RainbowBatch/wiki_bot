1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Damn important

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for this knowledge B I'm sick of them

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:01:02,720
Dot-com

5
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:05,792
Sit around a little bit

6
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:07,072
Alex Jones

7
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:10,656
Here we are.

8
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,216
My bright spot today Jordan is

9
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:17,312
I recently had to get something delivered by gopuff

10
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:23,968
Okay I've never used them before it's like a delivery thing they have a warehouse and they have

11
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:30,368
I like all kinds of like Sudafed if you need them

12
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,672
New York City

13
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:37,024
Or you don't want to go fantana also have booze from grocery items

14
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,816
I don't know I'm not this isn't a plug

15
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:45,216
I'm not worried about it otherwise this will make no sense

16
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:47,264
Why

17
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,104
I need to get this and I was looking over what they had

18
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:56,736
Stock and available and I saw something it was like well this is the coolest thing I've ever seen

19
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:57,760
And so

20
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:04,160
I ordered Bubba Bubba Monster Mash cereal

21
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:07,232
Frankenberry

22
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:11,328
Chocula The Mummy with the thing and then the werewolf

23
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:17,728
All of the monster cereals I have finally got together and they're jamming as a band

24
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:21,824
71 right

25
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,360
72 blueberry

26
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:27,200
Steph Curry fours name is fruit Brute

27
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:29,760
Alright I'm a mommy mommy

28
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,808
And then of course in 2021

29
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:33,600
They did my surgery tonight

30
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:34,624
So we have

31
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:39,488
Three things that I think are important to bring up about this the first is what month is it

32
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:43,072
Is the Halloween

33
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,608
Is

34
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:51,008
Early May well it's 50 years

35
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:57,408
Is it the 50th Anniversary later on a get-together 71

36
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:06,112
Cereal variety that's great

37
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:09,440
And I found something really

38
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:11,744
Telling about this

39
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,768
And that is

40
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,120
One of these things is not like the other okay it does not belong in there

41
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:18,656
Fruit Brute

42
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:23,520
No chocula all the rest of them are fruit based

43
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:29,920
Can't just have fruit bass serial your skin chocolate elements in there

44
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:38,880
Chocolate covered strawberry or something but it does not work in this area

45
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:39,648
Reform

46
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:41,696
Chocula

47
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:45,024
Go solo you need to be in the band

48
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,328
Vampires don't really team up with

49
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,120
Now they're pretty

50
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:53,728
Solo yellow hunt independent creatures the vampires

51
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,008
Renfield

52
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,080
Hell yeah but renfield's are disposed

53
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:00,384
True

54
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:04,480
My bright spot is you know

55
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:06,016
You know that I love the tennis has

56
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:12,416
True love the Rafa's right my favorite player obviously just guy who is really into

57
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:18,047
Big anti-vaxxing Australia

58
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,607
Over the past three days

59
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:22,399
A nineteen-year-old kid

60
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:25,727
Did something that hasn't been done for like

61
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:26,751
20 years

62
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:28,543
He beat Rafa

63
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:31,359
Djokovic and then zverev

64
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:32,895
Back-to-back-to-back

65
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:39,295
He PizzaRev that mean that one wasn't excited

66
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:43,647
I mean he's in the top 10 but he sucks

67
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:46,207
Is your boy

68
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:49,023
He's he's weak he's calories

69
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,071
Wow this year old kid

70
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:51,839
Spanish

71
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:52,607
Kid

72
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,887
From Spain

73
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:56,447
Look up to Rafa's entire life

74
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,727
Since before he

75
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:58,495
You is like

76
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,031
Biscuit

77
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,567
Want to Major

78
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:03,871
When this kid was 2 years old

79
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:04,895
Alright

80
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:05,919
So

81
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:09,247
Robbins injured

82
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:14,367
Is he's coming off a bad injury he's got a terrible foot injury because he's Rafa and that's just how he does things

83
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:17,951
So then he comes back he plays Djokovic the next day

84
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:19,487
Teresa

85
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:25,119
Three and a half hours man this was some of the best tennis anybody's ever played

86
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,399
19 years old

87
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:28,447
And you know what I was thinking Dan what's up

88
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:32,031
My entire adult life I've had a Spanish Adonis to look up to

89
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:34,079
And Ralph is going to retire

90
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,871
Well

91
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:42,271
The chain remains unbroken my presence of God closes a door he opens a window

92
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:48,159
Glad you have that next 20 years

93
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:50,463
It is amazing

94
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:54,303
That's great for my bright spot I had a prop

95
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,727
Alexa

96
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:04,031
I assumed you wanted a guitar

97
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:06,591
Leaving episode to go over

98
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:12,991
I think that maybe one of the more notable things have come out and Infowars world in the past

99
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,295
Since we've had an episode is the

100
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:20,415
Little bit audio of Paul Joseph Watson being a real races

101
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,695
But he might be erased

102
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:29,631
I don't care because this is only

103
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:32,191
Things that we've already known he's been expressing

104
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:35,519
Pretty much his entire career and through Infowars and

105
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:42,175
Actually it is to the Past

106
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:46,015
I need a break from Alex's present a Bull Shed from the present day.

107
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:51,903
2003 July 30th

108
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:52,927
Back in

109
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:53,695
2000

110
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,719
Alright

111
00:06:54,975 --> 00:07:00,095
Very interesting stretch of time I think we find some wacky characters and some silly.

112
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,143
Robin forget

113
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,935
Do that.

114
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,471
Doesn't do walks

115
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:12,127
Congratulations Makayla on your dreamy creamy wedding thank you so much you're now a policy wonk

116
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:17,759
Mickey and California you're on the air thanks for holding

117
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:20,831
Hello Eric I'm a first-time caller I'm a huge fan I love your work

00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:32,607
Spider bites

What's a beer in your horses you rode in on thank you so much you're now a policy wonk

123
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,615
Stop Alex before it's too late

124
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:51,295
Thank you I think it would be

125
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:54,879
Next one

126
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:01,791
Duncan forcse on Twitter

127
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:06,143
Isaiah house

128
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:12,543
Okay South Carolina I don't know what endorse political candidate

129
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:16,639
Ballotpedia page and it seems like he has some good answers to the question

130
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:22,783
Carolina check him out and see if he's a candidate you'll be interested in

131
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,831
Thank you so much Danny Duncan

132
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,719
Jordan we start off

133
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,023
Two

134
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,839
320 Wednesday to be

135
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,631
It might be

136
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,959
I don't know the calendar

137
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:44,287
Here's where we start off

138
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:05,791
Breakdown of the lies

139
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,871
You're being lied to

140
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:20,639
Still

141
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,815
Well maybe that's a bad power

142
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:42,911
This is a fascinating guess to see pop up here in the past

143
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:47,775
This is the first time that he's been on but it's not fascinating for the reasons that it might first appear

144
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:51,615
The reason it's interesting to see Michael chossudovsky is because

145
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:54,687
He's not someone who's still a regular on Alex's show

146
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,967
But should be

147
00:09:56,223 --> 00:10:02,367
For a while just Dusky made frequent appearances with Alex because in many ways he's an ideal

148
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,135
Guest

149
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:05,951
Beginning in 2001 found at the

150
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:08,255
The center for research on globalization

151
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:12,095
And from that point on has been responsible for one of the websites that disseminates

152
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,375
Ganttic portion

153
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,655
Of the anti-globalization

154
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,447
Conspiracy content that's on the internet

155
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:19,007
Global research research dot CA

156
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:25,407
We'll get more into him when he shows up on the show before I heard that this is the first time that him and

157
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:27,199
Alexandra Sadowski passes

158
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,991
Their paths crossed by years

159
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,015
Clerk of Court

160
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:33,343
I was kind of underwhelmed eventually but it's

161
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:37,439
This is the case of all Infowars origin story signed up

162
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:40,511
It is notable as hell like this is a big

163
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:42,047
Like

164
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,095
I guess maybe it's not a big deal but

165
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:46,143
If consequential in terms of like

166
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,423
The pads that

167
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,215
These two would end up going

168
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:53,311
Globalresearch.ca being like a gigantic

169
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,615
Conspiracy Clearinghouse

170
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:58,431
Emma and Alex being from 2000

171
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,967
Three awkward becoming

172
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:06,367
Such a luminary of the conspiracy the overlap of their

173
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:09,183
Wednesday is huge

174
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:12,511
I would be only for us

175
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:13,279
So look

176
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,815
Visa Visa

177
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:15,839
Saddam's kids

178
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,911
Yes they were shown

179
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,959
5 with facial reconstruction

180
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,775
Because they were abused

181
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:28,639
Quite butylated in the course of the US actions in

182
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,663
Killing them

183
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:32,223
And so in order to make them

184
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:35,551
Look more convincing right people

185
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:40,415
Maybe we can debate whether or not that was a great idea for for the people to do

186
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:42,463
They were giving some

187
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:43,999
Uno reconstructor

188
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:44,767
Surgery

189
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:51,423
And they look like folks from a bad wax museum

190
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:55,263
But Alex is an expert on these matters

191
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:06,015
What

192
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,167
1

193
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:36,479
Alex is a noted scholar in the realm of

194
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:41,855
The relative quality wax museums apparently

195
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:44,671
Driving around to different towns tasting there

196
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,207
Wax museums

197
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:55,167
Of course I think so when I was younger we did a lot of road trip vacations as well

198
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:57,727
Drive to California to see our family

199
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:03,103
Every summer saying we lived in Missouri so is Missouri to California and lies

200
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:07,967
Very long nap every night so we take make a meal out of Drive-In

201
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:09,247
Totally you go

202
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:12,063
Like one year you'd maybe take a straight shot

203
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:12,831
Through the middle

204
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:19,231
Boring to do again can't do anything different

205
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:24,863
Stuff like Wall Drug in somewhere where you every time you drive somewhere

206
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:27,167
Sooner or later there's going to be sinus like Caverns

207
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,191
Can you just go to

208
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,471
The world's largest

209
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:32,287
That's where you go

210
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,567
It's America

211
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:34,591
But yeah I don't

212
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:38,431
My experience looking back on it is definitely not like

213
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:41,503
Hey I know all about

214
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,807
Wax museum or anything

215
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:46,367
Maybe it's just the case

216
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,391
Deeply into wax

217
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:53,535
Yeah that does sound like a detail that should be shared if it is true

218
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,071
If it does what

219
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:59,935
There's no way you look we've we've been on road trips from the Midwest you road trip out here

220
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:02,495
The idea of going to like

221
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:03,775
Any of those

222
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,823
Stop over things where world's largest

223
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,639
And then be like okay well now we're going east

224
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:12,223
So we got to find and compare the world's largest butt over there

225
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:17,855
Do the one from the wet no more likely thing is that Alex went to one wax

226
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:23,231
Museum when he was a kid and now he's exaggerating that to create

227
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,535
God I also want him to be

228
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:29,631
Expert on Wax Museum me to overthink we are a little bit

229
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:34,751
Is introducing his main narrative

230
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:38,335
It's going to take over this episode but he's also really all over the play

231
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:43,967
Normal

232
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:53,695
We have now entered orwellian

233
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,511
Now

234
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,543
Mercantil

235
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:31,327
Louisiana wall the traffic

236
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,263
What

237
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:52,063
He's just rambling all over the place was a betting Market of some sort and I can't finish

238
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:55,135
Clarify what he's talking about

239
00:15:55,391 --> 00:16:01,535
This is Alex reporting that the government is setting up a literal casino-style betting pool where these leaks and

240
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:04,863
Contractors can gamble on coming Wars and countries collapse

241
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:10,239
That sounds great what is describing is called Pam or the policy analysis market for

242
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,263
I guess what

243
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,567
He's actually not far off from reality

244
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:16,127
Naturally there's some important caveats

245
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:22,527
To make in one of the first that I think the most important is well expressed in the paper by Robert Looney in the journal strategic

246
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:23,295
Inside

247
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:26,111
Quote because DARPA is mandated to take on risk

248
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:26,879
He projects

249
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:28,159
Failures have occurred

250
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:31,231
Sometimes the projects they embarked on a little bit wacky

251
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:33,535
He and this policy analysis Market is one

252
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,559
One such example

253
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:41,215
To be clear this project was abandoned around the time that this episode of Alex's show it never actually exist

254
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:44,799
It isn't actually asthma cabin as evil

255
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,079
Is it might initially sound

256
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,895
The basis for this idea was that for years

257
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:53,503
Futures markets have been used as a predictor of societal unrest and other sorts of

258
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,783
Geopolitical issues

259
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:57,599
Again from this strategic insights article

260
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:59,135
Yusuf

261
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:02,719
Petroleum Futures Contract prices isn't exactly the manner in which

262
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:06,815
Traders gauged the likely outcome of events such as the US Naval response

263
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:08,095
To arax invasion

264
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,887
Of quate in 1990

265
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:16,543
In a like manner the movement of petroleum Futures prices in late March 2003 after the recent Iraq

266
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,567
War Began reflect

267
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:19,615
To be implications Traders Drew

268
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:21,407
Concerning the outcome of the consul

269
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:28,319
Falling rapidly in the first few days of the conflict But Rising again after it became apparent the Iraq iresine would not fall in

270
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:29,087
In a matter of days

271
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:35,999
The goal of this policy analysis Market wasn't so much about allowing Elites to gamble on geopolitical conflict

272
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:39,327
Because in a roundabout way they already Cannon do

273
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:42,143
It was about giving us intelligence agencies mark

274
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:44,703
Get based ways to trade on different Patel

275
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:50,847
Which it was theorized by provide signals that can be interpreted like is already done with sudden movements

276
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:51,615
The commodity futures

277
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:52,895
Right

278
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:53,663
So

279
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:55,711
They were trying to create

280
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:57,759
I guess

281
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:02,367
Capitalism based virtual reality system whereby they can predict

282
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:06,975
Using the data of who's buying and selling what whether or not they're going to go to war

283
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:14,655
It's sort of but not not exactly like I did not like whether or not they're going to go to war

284
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:16,447
Predict potential coming

285
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:21,055
Trouble and stabilisation in area

286
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:25,151
Frere very important elements like

287
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:25,919
It wasn't

288
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,711
Supposed to be about anyone getting rich

289
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:31,039
And it wouldn't have been a vehicle for that they had a cap on a hundred dollars

290
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:31,807
Search for bats

291
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:35,391
And only 1,000 expert Raiders were even participated in this

292
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,695
Invited to participate initially

293
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:38,975
Maui

294
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:40,255
I'm saying that

295
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:42,047
The underlying idea here makes

296
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,071
Some sense

297
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:46,143
From just like a conceptual standpoint but please

298
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:48,447
Do not take that to be me saying this was a good I

299
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:53,823
It obviously something that could go wrong in about a thousand different ways and even leaving that aside its

300
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:54,847
Seems like it's in

301
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:55,615
Very poor

302
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,919
The world already has a

303
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:04,319
Learned bad image of organizations like the CIA they don't need to add the already bad Optics of a

304
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,599
They have to like

305
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:09,695
They're gambling on whether or not a particular government will fall the same

306
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:13,279
Might be involved in destabilizing

307
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:16,095
Yeah I like going back there like all man we lost

308
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:17,631
The ton of money on Haiti they got

309
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:18,911
Free s***

310
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,447
Rite Aid

311
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:22,751
There's so many things that just looks

312
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:23,775
Shity about that

313
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:28,639
Even though the system didn't appear to have the ability to be rigged in some particular way just

314
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:29,919
Just like you were saying the offer

315
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:30,943
It could be a disaster

316
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:35,295
He'll be a complete mess and I suspect that's part of the reason why

317
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,319
Never move forward

318
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,623
Alex is not recognizing

319
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:42,207
Or maybe doesn't even know or whatever

320
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,231
It's not moving

321
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:43,999
Forward

322
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:46,559
Water by

323
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,327
This point in

324
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:51,679
Late July about it though is that it does have that kind of

325
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:54,495
Evil Global policy that you're looking

326
00:19:54,751 --> 00:20:00,127
For if you are fighting against the global that's so great that such a supervillain

327
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:02,687
Well it it's not but it looks like

328
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:09,087
It's like Alice's he'll supervillain ask to me is more that there are like

329
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:14,207
Like a million better ways to do the thing that you're trying to achieve by setting this evil thing up

330
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,255
You know like I understand that

331
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:20,351
The goal you have right that would be away for like

332
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,631
People who have

333
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,423
Expert opinions to have some sort of

334
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,215
Conglomerate it like

335
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:28,031
Intelligent that they put together they

336
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:33,919
Putting a hundred bucks

337
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:34,687
Be like

338
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:41,343
A worthwhile thing is because then there is incentive for them not to just make rampant guests completely like I

339
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:46,207
The thought process

340
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:52,607
Without doing those tables and this is where we do tailback into that idea of a

341
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:59,007
DARPA having like these risky

342
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:05,407
Besides there's like a better way to do this

343
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:08,991
This is a possibility

344
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:11,039
You didn't work and I didn't happen

345
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,319
But

346
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,599
Alex gets

347
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,135
Two defining

348
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:16,159
The New World Order

349
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,208
You'll notice that Satan

350
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:24,096
The new world

351
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:26,912
Take a note well

352
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:59,168
You stopped taking notes

353
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,736
Rolled into a

354
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,528
Computerized

Determination

358
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,208
No Satan

359
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,232
No

360
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,000
No

361
00:22:57,024 --> 00:23:01,888
That also seems pretty different than like how you describe things

362
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:04,448
World economic Forum staff

363
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:10,592
That was just like a bunch of it like I could conceivably be mixed up in there but certainly

364
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:11,360
You know that's not

365
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:15,712
Call Schwab names University of

00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:21,856
Con artist New World

00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:24,416
About it

368
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:29,536
I think there's some similarities to how he describes things at the present tape there's like foundational differ

369
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:30,304
Princess

370
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,608
Ivey's Towing in 2003

371
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:34,656
Total that's kind of like if he wants

372
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:35,424
The pitch this

373
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:41,056
He's an extreme right-wing ideologue so he's railing against this new world order he's imagine to attack

374
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:43,872
And help explain social progress to his audience

375
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,944
It's not that Society decided to living by Ridge

376
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:47,968
Christian doctrine

377
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:50,016
Fair to be Christian

378
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:51,808
Top in society realized

379
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:54,368
The members of minority groups deserve equal rights

380
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,696
These things aren't the New World Order tricking people

381
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:59,488
There's a block in the morning

382
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,024
They're caught artists

383
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,560
Yes it is Hawaii

384
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:06,144
To choose as your main enemy the thing you embody

385
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,192
Cuz you're the most familiar with

386
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,264
University of Coronavirus

387
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:12,544
I know how they think

388
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:13,568
You know

389
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:16,128
I know how they

390
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:20,480
Because Gonzalez University of Colorado Springs

391
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:21,248
Okay

392
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:27,136
It's really critical that Alex be able to present people having different politics to him in this kind of fashion

393
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:28,160
Is there being tricked

394
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:30,720
Because the audience needs to be reassured that their right

395
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:37,376
It's really hard to make a coherent argument for a lot of Alex's political positions so his audience probably couldn't handle that

396
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:38,144
Kind of lifting

397
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,424
And instead of requiring

398
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:45,824
Them to do that you can create an overpowered Boogeyman who's manipulating everyone who disagrees with them into have

399
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,104
Having the positions that they have

400
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:50,944
You don't even need to come up with a reason to think they're wrong

401
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,248
Because the truth of your position is Southaven

402
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:55,040
There's just an evil cabal

403
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:56,064
Of King Rat

404
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:59,904
University trick them into thinking that it's great

405
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,928
It's a it's a

406
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,976
Why would I argue with you

407
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:05,536
If you are coming to me having been trick

408
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:11,936
By these people with you I have to remember that I

409
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:13,472
I have a position as well instead of

410
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:16,032
Just ignoring yours and if I were to do that

411
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:21,664
Oh boy I would remember that I do not have a very good position at all position is counter to that of

412
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:26,272
The king rat truth University con artist truth and that's

413
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:27,808
No good grade

414
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,928
Like I said most of this episode has him talking about this policy analysis Market

415
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:33,952
Get that.

416
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:35,232
Doesn't exist

417
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:39,072
What is a lot of fears about it and one of them is the terrorists

418
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:40,864
Could bet on their own terrorist Act

419
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,888
That's better

420
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,080
You're the first person I think of that I'm sure

421
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:22,848
Control

422
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:41,280
The grill

423
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:59,456
Physical problems with Alex's suggesting here

424
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:06,112
The first is that terrorists would not have access to this wedding Market the DARPA hippos

425
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:09,952
It's be able to go into the DARPA Market

426
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:14,304
Insider trading

427
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:20,704
The second problem is that Alex has seemingly suggesting that $100 bets in a very limited betting pool be Luker

428
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,288
Creative enough to be a motive for someone within our government to carry out 9/11

429
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:26,080
Record Put options

430
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:29,152
Well that's actually about something else will get a second

431
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:32,736
But that was his idea to seems incredibly stupid thought

432
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:34,784
Almost entirely illustrates why

433
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:36,832
There's already a ton of Futures mark

434
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:40,928
So you can make much larger put or call options on so if you actually

435
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:47,328
Or acting with some kind of foreknowledge of a coming terrorist attack you could do it exactly the thing I was already ransack about

436
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:50,912
Do it in the regular stock market where people would give you lots of money after

437
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:53,984
Also just as a reminder Alex believes is a matter of

438
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,264
Definitive facts that

439
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,824
The planes in 9/11 remote-controlled at this point

440
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:00,384
Which I'm sure he would not defend nowadays

441
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,432
Difference.in although I be interested

442
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,456
I'm having

443
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:05,248
Rogan ask him about it

444
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:06,528
Yeah that would be fun

445
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:09,088
So about that like record Put

446
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:10,112
He's talking about

447
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,904
Conspiracy about insider trading

448
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,208
Regarding United and American Airline

449
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:15,744
Prior to

450
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:20,096
I am so there were actually some trading patterns in united in America

451
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:21,632
Comstock that seemed suspicious

452
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:22,656
In the days prior

453
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:27,520
I to the attack has decided just to report that this was people who knew that 9/11 was coming

454
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:29,568
And they were trying to profit off that for now

455
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:35,456
What major question had to do with irregular purchases on September 6th

456
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:36,224
Intapp

457
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:40,064
The 9/11 commission investigated the actual trades that were made which

458
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,624
Tooted an unusually high low to put Ops

459
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:44,928
This was the result of quote

460
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:46,720
A single US based in

461
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:50,048
Institutional Investor with no conceivable ties to Elkader

462
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:52,864
Purchasing 95% of the United puts

463
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,192
On September 6th as part of a trading strategy

464
00:28:56,448 --> 00:29:01,056
It also included buying 115000 shares of American on September

465
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:01,824
Protect

466
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,872
Highly suspicious trading on its face

467
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:05,920
Yet further investigation has revealed

468
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:08,480
The trading had no connection to 9/11

469
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:10,016
So that kind of

470
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:11,040
Explains that

471
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:11,808
Right

472
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,600
Additionally a US base

473
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:18,464
Options trading news letterhead recommended people trade on American in a letter that they sent

474
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,232
Subscribers

475
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:20,512
On September 9th

476
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:24,096
Which added to the irregularity of trade volume on September 10th

477
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:27,168
I have almost everything Alex uses as proof of his

478
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:28,192
Mercy.

479
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:28,960
He has the

480
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:30,496
Appearance of something suspicious

481
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:31,776
And that's about it

482
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:36,640
He never takes the time to consider alternative explanations and when information comes out the causes

483
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:37,920
Conclusion that the question

484
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:38,944
He ignores

485
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,016
He pretends that he's been right all along when he's just been

486
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:43,296
Making s*** up

487
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:49,952
If someone did have foreknowledge of a common terrorist attack there are Financial mechanisms that already exist they could try to

488
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:52,000
Exploit profit from that knowledge

489
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:53,280
However

490
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:55,328
They're likely going to leave some kind of a

491
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:57,376
Trail and that could be a problem later

492
00:29:57,632 --> 00:30:00,448
Well analyzed now you would

493
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:01,216
Say that

494
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:05,568
You would say that but we do have very obvious recent evidence that the

495
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:11,968
Suggest as long as you're a senator you can do that s*** all day in public and everybody will know it's you and you'll walk

496
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:14,016
Kuwait's got free with more Millions than you had

497
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:21,184
There are some issues

498
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:30,400
Real problems that need to be ironed out and I'm not going to go so far as to say

499
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:35,776
I hate you get you definitely get in trouble if you did open

500
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:36,544
Nope but I

501
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:38,848
Think that if you were a terrorist

502
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:40,896
If you were terrorist I don't think

503
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:43,712
And the notion that you could do

504
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:45,248
That kind of insider trading

505
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:46,272
Wingstop within this

506
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:48,320
Proposed policy analysis Market

507
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:49,344
Is just not

508
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,136
The problem

509
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:54,720
Mainly I have with the argument is that it would be almost in

510
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:55,488
Possible

511
00:30:56,512 --> 00:31:00,096
To make it easier to inside trade anywhere other than the current

512
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:00,864
Stock market

513
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:01,632
That we have right now

514
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:06,752
Why would the military make something that would be easier to cheat on then the thing

515
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:10,336
So bailable to cheat on it's it's

516
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:13,920
In Subway's if you're looking to

517
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:15,200
Prophet

518
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:18,016
Insider information that you may have

519
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:19,296
It's a redundant

520
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:27,232
The day before this episode two Democratic senators Ron Wyden

521
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:28,512
Byron dorgan

522
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:32,608
Held a press conference leading opposition against the creation of this policy announced

523
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:33,376
Does Market

524
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:35,936
This ultimately led to the project being abandoned so

525
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:41,056
It's important to recognize that Alex only knows about the story because Democrats in Congress spoke out again

526
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:44,384
And state and the driving force for it not coming into existence

527
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,200
Who is opposition that started in the left-wing political Circle

528
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:49,504
Right so the devil didn't want to do

529
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:54,368
Alex should be supported

530
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:59,488
It's crazy how was like his politics are incoherent

531
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:00,768
Alex

532
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:03,328
It just believes that with the 9/11

533
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:08,192
United and American insider-trading that he believed it happened

534
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:09,216
That's

535
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:09,984
Proof

536
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,264
Vet

537
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,056
Like really reinforces his

538
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:14,848
Conspiracy about this new proposal

539
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,432
We

540
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,256
Alex builds fantasy stories out of his bad information

541
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:33,024
Bass

542
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:39,424
He's decided that he's proven the people in the CIA did insider trading on American in the united before 911 do he has approved

543
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,192
Not at all

544
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:41,984
You have a couple of suspicious fat

545
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,824
But he can point to which he's decided on an explanation for with no other

546
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:48,640
Has it turns out his explanation was wrong

547
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:50,944
But he's used that incorrect explanation

548
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,248
Create a background for this new conspiracy

549
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,528
How about the policy analysis

550
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:55,296
This Market

551
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:58,368
Because these folks got away with insider trading on 911

552
00:32:58,624 --> 00:33:02,464
Which they didn't they decided to institutionalize that insider trading through this Market

553
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,744
We do they weren't doing

554
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:06,816
Important economic analysis conspiracies

555
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:12,192
Sometimes the things he's saying are built on multiple levels of non-existent found a

556
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,544
I think this is an under-appreciated style of how Alex is often wrong he's like

557
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,848
Three levels of deep into being wrong

558
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:20,896
And that's just acceptable on a show because

559
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:21,920
The things you make up

560
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:23,456
Makes up the appeal

561
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:25,248
To the audience's emotional needs

562
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:30,368
Yeah he reminds me of what Douglas Adams said about

563
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,696
What's the name of the corporation I can't remember but it is

564
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:36,256
Is that their superficial design flaws

565
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:38,304
Make you so angry

566
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:41,888
That they cover over their fundamental design flaws

567
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:43,936
So you forget

568
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:49,056
You're so mad about all the things that they're sitting at you forget why you're you should be mad at

569
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:50,080
Deeply City

570
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:52,896
It seems almost like a smokescreen like

571
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:55,712
He's wrong and so many superficial ways you you're like

572
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:59,552
Oh well I've got that so you don't even dig deeper to find out how he's running like

573
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:02,880
Different in some ways that kind of

574
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:05,440
Describes a lot of the

575
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:08,256
The public perception of Alex's show

576
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:11,328
Like there's a lot of like very surface-level things that are

577
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:13,632
Obviously infuriating

578
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:17,728
That takes up a lot of the criticism directed towards him

579
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:18,752
As opposed

580
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:21,312
To recognizing that there is a internal

581
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:24,896
Just foundational problem with a thing

582
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:28,480
Things that he reports and expresses that it basically how he does

583
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:31,552
That is sometimes missed from

584
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:34,368
So Alex has a

585
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:35,648
Clip that he describes for

586
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:36,416
From Hardball

587
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:38,208
I don't think this happen

588
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:54,848
3 months before 9/11

589
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:16,352
I can't find the actual video this claimed Hardball appearance but I do know that after 9/11

590
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:18,912
Heart did make appearances of Chris Matthews just got to

591
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:21,472
He released in January 2001

592
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:23,776
Call the roadmap for National Security

593
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:27,360
It was a product of a committee that he co-chaired with Warren Rudman and the

594
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:30,176
Conclusion that they came to was that we weren't prepared at all for

595
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:34,272
For the possibility of an attack within the United States clearly wrong haha

596
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:40,672
Court was very public about his concerns Pryor tonight 11:00 so I don't exclude the possibility that he went on Hardball and just

597
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:44,256
But I don't believe it all Alex's interpretation of this

598
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:50,400
Be like if somebody

599
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:53,472
The CDC was like our not ready for a pandemic

600
00:35:53,984 --> 00:36:00,128
I like that all of them every single life

601
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:04,992
That's probably proves that they were going to just cause pass out

602
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:06,528
So Alex has

603
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,088
Earlier we heard him talking about the New World Order

604
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:10,368
The devil wasn't

605
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:11,136
Involved

606
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:12,416
Now get this

607
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:13,184
He's back in

608
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,232
Devil might be involved

609
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:22,144
The world

610
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:30,336
Could come off as kind of metaphorical

611
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:31,616
It's pretty close

612
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:33,408
It's interesting though

613
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:35,456
It's an example of him painting

614
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:37,760
But he's fighting the literal devil

615
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:38,784
Also Alex

616
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:44,416
Give a citation for this in the Bible so I'm going to have to assume that he's referring to Luke chapter 4

617
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:46,208
Where Jesus is tempted in the wilderness

618
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:49,024
Verses 5 through 7 say quote

619
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,584
And the devil taking him into a high mountain

620
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,912
Show to him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time

621
00:36:55,424 --> 00:37:01,312
And the devil said unto him all this power will I give thee and the glory of them for that is delivered unto me

622
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:03,872
And to whomsoever I will

623
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:04,896
Given

624
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:07,968
If thou therefore it will will a worship me

625
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:09,248
All Shelbyville

626
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:16,416
That's all good and well but this is a naive and shallow interpretation of that passage to conclude that the devil actually has

627
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:17,184
Control evolve

628
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:17,952
These kingdoms

629
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:20,768
You have to remember the characters that play here

630
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:23,840
Number one trait ascribe to the devil

631
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:24,864
Is that he's a liar

632
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:32,800
John 8:44 quote when he lies he speaks his native language

633
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:36,896
For he is a liar and the father of Lies he would do

634
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:39,456
I believe in the devil controls all these

635
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:44,320
Alex is buying into the devil's lie that he was using to try to tempt Jesus into worship

636
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:46,624
Alex is entirely missing

637
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,952
Point of this verse and that misinterpretation seems to actually be kind of

638
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:52,768
Essential Cornerstone of his worldview because

639
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:54,048
Outside of that stuff

640
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:56,352
Jesus seems pretty okay with governments

641
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:58,400
Frankly

642
00:37:58,656 --> 00:37:59,424
In Alex's

643
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,704
My I feel like

644
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,544
Alex if he were in Jesus's situation would be like

645
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:05,568
Sweet

646
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:09,920
I'll take it again devil the devil be like a high I didn't actually have any like

647
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:13,760
You told me you had it are you telling me that you lied to me what

648
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:15,808
The devil

649
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:22,208
That's not something you do but we had a thing man I signed everything in Blood and Shay

650
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:24,768
Panthers and ironic

651
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:25,536
Twist

652
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:27,584
Typically

653
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:30,144
The Devil is a straight-up

654
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:36,800
Are you telling me that when I got everything I wished for perhaps I should have been more care

655
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:40,640
Careful about what it was that it was I was with all the rules of the universe

656
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:47,040
What was have to tell you what they're doing in advance operating

657
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:48,576
Please adjust the truth

658
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:52,160
Please adjust the way you view the world man I really think

659
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:58,560
It's weird to take the devil at face value

660
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:00,096
Thing the devil does

661
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:01,632
Anne

662
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:02,400
Contacts

663
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:03,424
The biblical stories

664
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:07,520
Or anything extra biblical stories

665
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:13,152
I mean you know that's what's funny about that is that that reminds me more of the f******

666
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:14,944
Chaos magician who is like

667
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:19,040
Well you know that the devil is in control over all the Earth and all that stuff in your leg

668
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:21,600
Wait

669
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:23,392
Alex is a chaos

670
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:25,184
Magician probably not for

671
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:27,488
He's definitely weird map

672
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:33,376
Custom Calls and gets a bad news from a caller about this DARPA project policy analysis

673
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:34,144
This Market

674
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:38,240
Guess what

675
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:39,008
Cancel that

676
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,056
BBC News

677
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,480
Guaranteed her fault

678
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,528
Parameters and batteries

679
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:56,928
Embarrassing

680
00:39:57,184 --> 00:40:00,000
An hour doesn't exist anymore

681
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:02,048
But on the other hand it's even worse

682
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:04,096
Because the way Alex tries to salvage

683
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:06,400
Some kind of a meeting out of his show is to protect

684
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:07,680
The program will be back with

685
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:08,960
Doubled funding Within

Guarantees

688
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:17,664
This didn't happen and it goes out of history is just one of them Billy and examples of predictions that Alex has gotten wrong while pretending that is predict

689
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,944
Actions are based off a pattern

690
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:23,296
That is imaginary enemies engaging in these right 95% of the f****** time

691
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:26,368
Alex that thing you said was going to happen it's not even close to half

692
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,672
Means it's going to double happen

693
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,208
I guarantee

694
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:31,744
Cool good work

695
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:34,560
So although the Galaxy's wrong about you

696
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:37,376
He continues to be wrong about dr. David Kelly

697
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:41,216
Only weapons inspector who took his own life

698
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,008
Is it going to take

699
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:45,568
Figure out

700
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:48,128
Find out

701
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:49,152
18 flashes red

Alex kissing anyone

703
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:48,032
And it stinks like just about every

704
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:50,080
Getting on right now

705
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:54,431
Has created a full-on story

706
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:55,967
Based on nothing

707
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:57,503
Baseball

708
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:59,039
Disrespectful a little bit

709
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:13,119
Bulshit

710
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:16,191
Alex brings in Michael Johnson.

711
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:19,775
And they get to talk about the policy analysis

712
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:22,847
Market

713
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:24,639
Anything

714
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:28,223
It will be tough for Alex

715
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:32,063
Haha

716
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:34,623
Anyway

717
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:36,159
A baby say about Pam

718
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:40,511
Korea

719
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:57,151
People invest

720
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:57,919
In this

721
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:00,479
People you know

722
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:02,783

00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:09,695
What

725
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:11,231
No inside knowledge

726
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:12,255
When

727
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:13,023
And where are these

728
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:14,303
Political assassin

729
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:15,327
Fascinations on

730
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:18,399
Are going to occur

731
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:20,447
Will the Colts lose their life

732
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:21,471
Time-saving

733
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:26,335
They have to make a public and now

734
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:32,479
That's such a bizarre interpretation of this

735
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:35,039
Never ends up happening

736
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:37,599
It never was designed to be something for like

737
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:41,183
Public betting in the intelligence

738
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:42,975
Value of it

739
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:45,535
Yeah just random

740
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:46,303
Yeah

741
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:52,191
We're taking like a long bats like oh this is a long shot but maybe I'll hit big

742
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:58,591
That's dumb they clearly don't know what they're talkin about I mean also that's not

743
00:43:58,847 --> 00:43:59,359
Mince words

744
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:04,223
If this guy was saying something Alex didn't like you do a very disrespectful impression of him

745
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:05,247
Oh yeah

746
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:06,271
Oh yeah

747
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:07,551
Abby

748
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:12,159
Godby idea that he's like okay well the first thing I see here

749
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:13,695
Is it obviously

750
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:15,487
Normal people are going to

751
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:19,071
You bet their life savings on whether or not

752
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:25,727
Steve pieczenik murders another Aldo Moro you're going to lose the car and then they've got nothing it's going to be like

753
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:26,751
Like though it's like

754
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:31,615
Do you understand

755
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:34,687
What events like if I

756
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:35,711
Ferdinand

757
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:39,295
Assassinated it did everybody everybody went broke

758
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:44,927
Like I'm mediately the markets crashed

759
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:51,327
There everyone was very bullish on the Ottoman Empire

760
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:55,423
Yes I think that's a little silly and it sets the tone of like

761
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:56,959
Well baby you guys aren't really

762
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:59,007
Discussing things in

763
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:00,287
In reality

764
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:03,359
Just Dusty also think

765
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:04,895
David Kelly with murder

766
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:11,295
So cold

767
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:12,063
Suicide

00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:13,855
Wichita

2

770
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:26,911
Political assassination

771
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:32,031
The David

772
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:32,799
Kelly

773
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:36,383
It's made public

774
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:39,199
Committee

775
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:40,991
Lead to the

776
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:42,015
To the

777
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:44,063
Tony basket

778
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:49,183
As a strong insinuations he was murdered to silence him from take a shower Tony Blair

779
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:50,463
Whatever

780
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:53,279
I don't really think

781
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:54,303
Think that it's

782
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:56,607
Ghetto super hard headed but I think it was straight

783
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:59,167
Point that I want to drive home

784
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:09,151
Caring

785
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:20,415
Hitler orca

786
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:30,655
Roman emperor in Spanish

787
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:34,751
Well you know I

788
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:37,567
Believe that

789
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:38,335
Ultimate

790
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:41,663
Project

791
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:51,903
The first is that no matter what's happening at any point in time and no matter what happened prior Alex will always believe

792
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:52,671
Leave of the globalist

793
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:55,231
Becoming so much more open in their treachery

794
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:57,535
Evil than they were before

795
00:46:57,791 --> 00:47:00,607
It didn't used to be like that did after yesterday they were left

796
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:04,191
Evil than they are today I just everything crystallized for me last night

797
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:07,519
I was up for 67,000 our strength

798
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:10,847
This is to create the appearance of immediacy in the audio

799
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:12,895
It's taking advantage of their recently bias

800
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:18,783
This is the same reason that in the present-day Alex called everything that happens the globalist to main attack

801
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:25,439
On what level is to keep people excited and engage but it also serves another purpose and that's to distract people from the things you've

802
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:26,719
Recently been wrong about

803
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:30,303
The other thing I think is illustrated by the Clippers out easily Alec

804
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:31,327
Alex goes off message

805
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:35,679
He's trying to play that game was like the globalist a really wild now this time

806
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:39,263
He forgets that he's not supposed to think the bushes actually in charge

807
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:44,895
Then he has to come in and remind him that they're supposed

808
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:47,967
Speed evil cabal and charger thing writes like an actual

809
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:49,503
Public-facing pirate buddy

810
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:50,271
Stick to the script

811
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:56,671
You just forgets his own mythology at times when it starts feeling good two to paint things in a certain way

812
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:58,207
More exciting to start talking about

813
00:47:58,463 --> 00:47:59,231
Bushes

814
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:05,631
Pelicula that's a great day today now what's going on

815
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:07,679
Marion horses always good

816
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:14,079
I think those are some important things to recognize about Alex at no matter what. Of time you're in

817
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:17,663
The globalist are really doing it this time

818
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:22,271
Everything the game has holyshit the worm has turned

819
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:28,671
The kid the globalists they were at least polite about how yeah I know but now they're just flaunting it in our faces

820
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:35,071
They would hide it I know you never used to see people spit on the sidewalk I seen all the time cigarettes

821
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:36,863
So it's a nightmare

822
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:39,167
Search osantowski

823
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:43,263
Revealed something that I think is a way into understanding

824
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:46,335
What is his s*** is all about

825
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:47,871
They're saying

826
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:50,687
Korea

827
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:54,527
North Korea

00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:06,559
Pictures of North Korea

830
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:14,751
Between the two

831
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:18,335
It don't know if

832
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:19,103
Career with

833
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:20,383
Really

Security

835
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:24,991
Peninsula

836
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:28,575
That's really where you see some of the Tendencies of Charles Bukowski

837
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:34,463
His Wesley paint itself as an anti-globalization research outlet but the larger reality is that

838
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:35,999
There's kind of anti us

839
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:40,095
It's all good well Deborah bus criticisms of the u.s. in our foreign policy

840
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:44,703
Past and present but it's another thing to make

841
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:49,311
2:02 other countries that are doing fairly similar things or

842
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:50,079
Ghetto

843
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:50,847
Worse

844
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:57,503
Princeton's Google research was a major player in spreading Russian base propaganda both in the spirit

845
00:49:57,759 --> 00:49:59,039
Pro-assad narrative

846
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:00,831
Regarding Russia's involvement in Syria

847
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:05,695
Any terms of the flow of every conspiracy involving Hillary in the 2016

848
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:09,535
They do basically the same kind of thing Alex does which is

849
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:13,631
To say that they take Outlander stuff and then give it a slick presentation that allows

850
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:15,423
Is it to be more easily disseminated

851
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:16,191
Do unto us by

852
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:16,959
Acting viewers

853
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:20,799
They give the appearance of credibility and research to conspiracy

854
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:24,895
To give you some kind of idea of the content they're putting out

855
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:28,479
A 2020 State Department investigation found quote

Popularly known as the GRE

861
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:44,607
That's kind of sloppy nonsense that's going on there

862
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:47,167
That's set lippo published 7

863
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:48,959
Authors who didn't exist

864
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:50,495
A total of over

865
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:52,031
180 articles

866
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:53,055
By these fake

867
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:56,383
People in intelligence assets

868
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:57,407
Using fake name

869
00:50:57,919 --> 00:50:58,943
Wow

870
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:01,247
That's a win-win

871
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:07,135
Yeah the Russian ski recently was making the rounds blaming the United States for Russia invade

872
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:08,159
Dating Ukraine because

873
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:09,951
Kind of is constant drumbeat right

874
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:14,559
Beyond that Global Research had some really incredibly shity content over

875
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:15,327
For the years

876
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:21,727
Recently in 2020 they published an article titled China's coronavirus a shocking update that the virus originated in

877
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:22,495
In the United States

878
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:25,311
As article was tweeted out by the spokesperson for the

879
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:26,847
The Chinese foreign Ministry

880
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:30,431
Hello it's not based on any actual true information to became part of a large

881
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:31,711
PR campaign in

882
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:33,503
Conspiracy theory against the United Way

883
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:37,599
Course there is a little bit of a caveat that should be given is

884
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:40,159
In the larger picture of Global Research

885
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:45,279
Shoes website they also do cover a lot of stories that relate to countries are often ignored by what you might call

886
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:47,071
Mainstream media but

887
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:53,471
There's a lot of other independent Outlets that do that too and don't also traffic and rank information misinformation

888
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:56,543
Website associate only produced in a such a

889
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:57,311
Clear slant

890
00:51:57,567 --> 00:52:00,383
Even if they do have coverage of issues relating to things like

891
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:02,687
In Old Latin American countries that are often

892
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:04,735
It's pretty hard

893
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:06,783
The trust of the reporting that you're getting is worth it

894
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:09,087
He's probably look somewhere else that's what I would say

895
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:10,879
But I do think it's worth like

896
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:13,439
Bring up there like you know there are some things

897
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:17,279
They might they might raise some issues sure like

898
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:18,303
Are worse

899
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:19,839
Knowing about

900
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:22,655
But you get better information about those issues elsewhere

901
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:26,239
Overall Chelsea houska Global Research Ark

902
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:31,359
Conspiracy Peddlers that are in the business of Christian anti-gay and anti-western perspective

903
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:33,919
As a anti-globalization message

904
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:35,967
That's the answer to sleight-of-hand

905
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:36,991
Engaged in here

906
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:40,831
If I have to guess why cha Sadowski is gunning for us anymore

907
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:41,599
This is why

908
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:46,463
But he and Alex appeared to be on the same page and I love you overlap but they're actually polar up

00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:53,375
Strongly opposed to the West fetishizes

911
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:54,399
Americana

912
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:58,239
Nor does he feel that American loser is a good acceptable history

913
00:52:58,495 --> 00:53:00,287
Perhaps not probably not

914
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:05,151
I think it's a fundamental difference between them and maybe it took years for them to figure that out right

915
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:06,687
Cuz he's either pretty

916
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:08,991
He's a fixture in a number of like

917
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:11,807
Later years of alopecia

918
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:18,207
Sooner or later they got to the point where Alex is like man I love America and he's like you know America's evil right needs like

919
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:25,375
Start talking a little bit about conspiracies about saddam's kids

920
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:26,655
Joann Dobbs

921
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:29,471
Sansa surrounding matin

922
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:42,527
Turn her in there

923
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:56,863
Regardless

924
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:01,471
Where's

925
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:04,543
White these guys out

926
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:08,639
Bissell good fun but Alex just making

927
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:12,479
Stop out of his imagination to try to justify the incorrect conclusion that The Killing

928
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:13,247
Samsung

929
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:14,783
Songs with lyrics

930
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:19,647
Acting with the Goodwill will make

931
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:23,487
He said that they only sent in helicopters and tanks so they would be able to

932
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:25,279
The speaker these bodies enough to be able to

933
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:26,815
The claim that they were saddam's son

934
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:31,423
Leaving aside the subsequent text test

935
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:33,471
Confirm that they were Saddam Sons

936
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:36,543
I know it's a totally wrong

937
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:39,615
Imagine a scenario where some troops

938
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:42,943
Just went in to try to capture or kill them and they ended up in a bad

939
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:43,711
Situation

940
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:48,319
Let's imagine that maybe a couple of soldiers were killed in that saddam's kids got away

941
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:52,415
In that situation you can easily come up with how that would be covered in Alex's

942
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:53,183
The show

943
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:53,951
You have the option

944
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:58,047
I'm saying that the military should have sent in tanks and helicopters in

945
00:54:58,303 --> 00:55:00,607
Because they secretly wanted saddam's kids to get away

946
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:02,911
Belarus

947
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:03,679
That's the way

948
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:04,703
There are other options

949
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:07,775
Alex could go with it but the point is that with this narrative

950
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:09,311
He has you coming and going

951
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:12,639
There isn't an option that he can't turn into some kind of

952
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:15,199
Conspiracy so you kind of just have to ignore his point

953
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:21,087
It's not really that weird that they sent in tanks and helicopters and Alex doesn't even actually think

954
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:24,927
He just knows that pretending that he thinks it's weird Works to strengthen the

955
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:25,951
Conspiracy that he has

956
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:28,255
The kids are really dead so Q goes with

957
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:30,047
It's convenient

958
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:31,327
Yeah yeah yeah

959
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:37,727
It is it's always great to listen to and then bang your head against the wall when

960
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:40,287
People are making bad faith argument that they don't even believe

961
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:43,615
True true but that's our job

962
00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:47,455
That's why I replacement walls for you

963
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:50,015
Over there

964
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:50,783
That's true

965
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:55,135
Do you have like a psionic scream like a banshee

966
00:55:55,391 --> 00:56:01,279
I am essentially Banshee from Mortal Kombat from the 29th

967
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:04,351
Dusky talking about his

968
00:56:04,607 --> 00:56:05,119
Both headlights

969
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:07,679
A little different than Alex's but maybe there's some

970
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:08,447
Some similarities

971
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:09,983
I think it's it's

972
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:10,751
Pittston

973
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:14,079
Which is

974
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:15,359
Actually misleading

975
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:16,639
Keep up the cost

976
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:18,175
The headlines on the

977
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:23,039
And if you want to know the truth you have to read between the lines

978
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:24,063
Between the headlines

979
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:26,111
Go to the official.

980
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:27,647
You have to go on the internet

981
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:29,951
Plates

982
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:31,999
Information

983
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:32,767
Witches

984
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:44,543
Headlines

985
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:02,207
Really

986
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:10,399
Make a real story

987
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:18,335
It's very supposed

988
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:20,383
Absolutely

989
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:22,687
So I agree with trust Dusky sort of

990
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:28,319
Think that he's in the right place to be getting that advice

991
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:30,367
I get four words as headline Central

992
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:34,463
I do take issue with it will he probably means by reading between the lines

993
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:36,511
Speakers for Alex that just means making

994
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:37,279
Things up

995
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:39,327
Which I don't think it's a good part of the news

996
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:40,095
Consumption

997
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:42,399
Also that story Alex is telling us

998
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:43,679
Completely bizarre

999
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:49,311
Let me track his line of thought and then explain what I think is probably going okay okay thank you

1000
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:55,711
Tom Ridge and Homeland Security were going to erase all livestock.

1001
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:57,759
Call a big headline about it

1002
00:57:58,015 --> 00:58:00,063
Now in reality this is a campaign that would

1003
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:00,831
Sport domestic

1004
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:02,623
Beef production but these globalist

1005
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:04,927
I knew that Alex Community were so against

1006
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:05,695
The New World Order

1007
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:10,559
But if they reported it in headlines about how is bypassing a tracing all the livestock

1008
00:58:10,815 --> 00:58:14,399
Has friends would be against and they lead a charge to oppose the plan

1009
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:15,679
Globalist want

1010
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:19,775
Begin with they wanted this good thing to be defeated right as opposed to just not

1011
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:23,871
Proposing it or something I don't know if I understand correctly

1012
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:28,223
Play Alex is not realizing that what he's saying is that we are so f******

1013
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:33,855
Unpredictable they know that if they put a headline on something we won't read the article and we'll just get mad and mediate

1014
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:38,975
Yep and he's a little bit saying that like

1015
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:40,255
Decatur dad supposed to be like

1016
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:48,191
Simple dumb

1017
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:51,519
Angela Keys it will be like are those Stars

1018
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:53,055
Can we fight back

1019
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:55,359
So here's what I'm pretty sure actually happened

1020
00:58:55,871 --> 00:59:02,015
In the executive order that Bush signed forming the Department of Homeland Security what are the responsibilities of the office was to

1021
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:08,415
To quote coordinate efforts to protect United States livestock Agriculture and systems for the provision of water and food

1022
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:09,183
For human use

1023
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:11,487
And consumption from terrorist attacks

1024
00:59:12,255 --> 00:59:14,559
Because I was only read Sensational ass right wing

1025
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:15,583
Conspiracy blogs

1026
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:18,399
Teresa headline that reported that is the only answer

1027
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:20,191
Security Department announcing the Third

1028
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:22,751
Tagged tagged spray salt

1029
00:59:23,007 --> 00:59:25,311
So that was the conclusion that he came to that looking

1030
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:26,591
Maybe deeper into the subject

1031
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:28,895
How is repeated this narrative to his audience

1032
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:33,247
Canceled ride rally opposition to the protection of Our Lives

1033
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:34,015
From the threat

1034
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:35,039
Disruption

1035
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:36,319
Start at some point

1036
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:41,951
Alex must have realized that he was wrong so in order to save face and not have to admit that he's wrong and he's an idiot

1037
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:44,255
He pretended that the initial headlining Redwood

1038
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:45,791
Actually a globalist blocked

1039
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:52,447
He was opposed to the new world orders they plan to that headline so we would have posed a good thing and further

1040
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:54,751
The globalist master plan

1041
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:55,519
Rye Rye

1042
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:57,567
There's something so on brand about this

1043
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:04,223
Like Alex can admit that he's wrong about something but only when the reason he's wrong is that because there was a conspiracy against

1044
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:06,271
It's time to make it wrong

1045
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:11,135
But he doesn't realize that this makes him even more of a bumbling dope in the story

1046
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:12,159
It does

1047
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:16,511
Instead of him just well if you're

1048
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:18,303
Somebody who reacted

1049
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:21,375
To quickly and who Adam Andrew just

1050
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:24,191
Threw something out there without thinking about my knee-jerk idiot

1051
01:00:25,471 --> 01:00:27,263
He's not only a knee-jerk idiot

1052
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:31,615
But he's implied that his pattern of behavior is so come

1053
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:33,407
Unpredictable

1054
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:38,271
One-dimensional taken advantage of

1055
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:41,343
With zero effort on their part whatsoever

1056
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:46,975
Instead of him making a mistake this is him being exploited because the only thing he does is make list

1057
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:55,423
The show does go on in Tuskegee is on for the rest of the show that take some calls

1058
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:57,983
Derailed by a caller who's like

1059
01:00:59,007 --> 01:01:04,383
Talking about how we always talk about what the United States is doing overseas we know that's bad

1060
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:05,151
You give it up

1061
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:06,175
For the people who were trying to

1062
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:08,479
Change things here

1063
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:09,503
Keep sort of

1064
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:10,271
Hinting

1065
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:12,319
I think he's talking about like

1066
01:01:12,575 --> 01:01:13,343
Militia

1067
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:14,111
Right wing

1068
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:15,391
Terrorist types

1069
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:17,695
I think that's what he's talking about

1070
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:24,095
Because he's being really insinuating and Alex is really weird about it as opposed to getting mad at him

1071
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:26,399
I think Alex can tell that's what

1072
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:32,799
He's signaling to I would have clips of it gets very bizarre but it goes on for f****** Everest

1073
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:34,847
Never really materialized into anything

1074
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:38,687
You got to care about what the people here are doing okay

1075
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:41,759
See you got to care about okay

1076
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:42,783
See

1077
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:44,319
Kman

1078
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:47,903
It's not before

1079
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:49,695
It goes on

1080
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:50,463
Quite a while

1081
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:52,255
So we jump to the 30th

1082
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:55,071
And Alex had trazodone ski on

1083
01:01:55,327 --> 01:01:55,839
29

1084
01:01:56,351 --> 01:01:59,167
And he's got another exciting guests also with a name

1085
01:01:59,423 --> 01:02:00,447
That's fun

1086
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:01,471
On this episode

1087
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:07,103
Call governor

1088
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:10,943
Point

1089
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:15,295
Government

1090
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:17,087
300 sounds

1091
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:23,231
The recall

1092
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:32,191
Thought you to move

1093
01:02:42,431 --> 01:02:43,967
Arnold

1094
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:45,759
Or will it be

1095
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:47,039
Be one of them working

1096
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:48,575
Members

1097
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:13,663
And that's why everybody

1098
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:14,431
More than boss

1099
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:21,599
New World Order

1100
01:03:21,855 --> 01:03:22,879
What streets are

1101
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:25,695
Name is Howard Telugu

1102
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:26,719
Howard klug

1103
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:27,743
Spoiler alert

1104
01:03:28,255 --> 01:03:34,143
So yeah we got the guy who started a group that was gathering signatures Davis recall

1105
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:37,983
Cancel great Bazaar Gastonia see these two days a very excited

1106
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:42,335
So the first thing that jumps out to me in this clip is that Alex

1107
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:43,359
Just described

1108
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:47,711
Every place he doesn't like basically as where the globalist are testing their system

1109
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:48,735
And where he live

1110
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:51,039
Sure but he has problems with us

1111
01:03:51,807 --> 01:03:52,319
Like

1112
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:55,135
Beast doesn't like a California New York

1113
01:03:55,647 --> 01:03:57,695
This is a little weird since it also includes Boston

1114
01:03:57,951 --> 01:03:58,463
Which isn't to say

1115
01:03:58,719 --> 01:04:00,767
Also Texas which as you pointed out

1116
01:04:01,279 --> 01:04:04,607
Where he lives at is a Democrat area

1117
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:06,911
Massachusetts at Austin it's

1118
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:07,935
Texas in Boston

1119
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:09,215
True

1120
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:11,519
So that might have slipped him up that does happen

1121
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:14,591
To me that what Alex's driving at is that every state

1122
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:17,151
Including Boston is a globalist testing

1123
01:04:18,431 --> 01:04:21,247
In the present-day Alex's move that largely to other

1124
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:28,159
Typically China is a globalist they have a more repressive government

1125
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:29,951
Can use the image of their government

1126
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:32,767
Globalist have planned

1127
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:33,535
For them

1128
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:36,095
Periodically whenever someone catches on and

1129
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:39,423
Right-wing media circles he'll add other countries to the list

1130
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:40,447
The places that are global

1131
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:41,471
Most testing grounds

1132
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:44,799
For instance when the trucker convoys were going on in Canada

1133
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:49,663
Turned out to be like at the biggest place where globalist are testing things out

1134
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:51,455
Austin Grant and that's why they were there

1135
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:57,087
I went there were a lot of stories about covid protest in Australia it just so happened that that was actually wear

1136
01:04:57,343 --> 01:05:03,487
Boasted their trial runs of to urinate a lot of Trials going on

1137
01:05:03,743 --> 01:05:05,023
Everywhere in fact it's almost

1138
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:09,375
Impossible to imagine how they organize everything

1139
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:14,751
I don't know what that is but I seen commercials on Youtube videos

1140
01:05:15,775 --> 01:05:18,591
So this is just another feature of Alex's presentation

1141
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:21,407
My profound deep and meaningful but it's actually the same talking

1142
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:23,967
Website in 2003

1143
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:27,039
He sang with these Global if they're trying things out and states

1144
01:05:27,295 --> 01:05:28,063
And also Boston

1145
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:32,927
So I want to take a moment to point out that this is exactly what Alex believe should be happening

1146
01:05:33,695 --> 01:05:38,815
According to his version of federalism the state they're basically Laboratories were policies can be tested

1147
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:39,583
See if they work

1148
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:42,911
That's a huge part of a Thrust behind states rights

1149
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:49,311
The idea that if a state wants to experiment with a particular policy the people can vote to do that more easily than they could

1150
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:51,871
If it were something it was being done on a federal level

1151
01:05:52,127 --> 01:05:54,943
And if there's something that goes really wrong with the policy it's

1152
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:58,015
Confined to that state doesn't involve everybody in the country

1153
01:05:58,527 --> 01:06:03,903
The results could then be evaluated another States be able to decide if they wanted to try it out to

1154
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:06,975
If I were to pretend that I was his enemies were real

1155
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:08,511
How do you talk about something other than

1156
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:11,839
Just like leaning policies like welfare and anti-discrimination laws

1157
01:06:12,351 --> 01:06:14,143
His point is still self-defeating

1158
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:16,703
According to his own philosophy these states should be

1159
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:19,007
Testing out policy so people can see if they work

1160
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:25,663
Like for example how Colorado legalized weed and then in the past six years they brought in more than 1.6 billion additional

1161
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:26,943
Revenue

1162
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:31,039
Millions of which have gone to affordable housing dealing with the opioid crisis

1163
01:06:31,295 --> 01:06:35,135
And improving schools both from a construction program standpoint

1164
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:40,767
Alex believe that the states

1165
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:42,559
Should be the place where political experiments

1166
01:06:43,327 --> 01:06:45,119
Except when those experimental things

1167
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:46,143
50 doesn't like

1168
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:47,679
And then it's like

1169
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:49,727
Am doing a testing ground

1170
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:52,543
And it is a good place to test things

1171
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:58,943
But if they are safe like another state is testing something that you don't want

1172
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:00,991
Then you should orchestrated Echo

1173
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:03,551
Avon campaign to overthrow the Supreme Court

1174
01:07:03,807 --> 01:07:05,599
Take it over and then insist upon

1175
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:07,647
Controlling things everywhere that you don't have

1176
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:09,695
Have control over much like

1177
01:07:09,951 --> 01:07:11,487
Making tax revenues from weed

1178
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:12,767
That seems to have work

1179
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:15,583
It does seem to have

1180
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:17,631
Alex's story that he missed

1181
01:07:17,887 --> 01:07:18,655
Yesterday

1182
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:21,983
I'll tell you he doesn't get in-depth on it

1183
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:23,263
But he's pretty gross

1184
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:28,639
Diverted off of the other

1185
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:32,735
Go to New York

1186
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:36,575
Larry maker saying

1187
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:39,903
Orientation

1188
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:06,783
Wow hoboy

1189
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:08,575
That's weird that is very weird

1190
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:15,231
So this is about Harvey Milk High School which was introduced in 2002 as an alternative school that will cater to lgbtq

1191
01:08:15,487 --> 01:08:17,023
Do students in New York City

1192
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:19,839
Who are having difficulties in their Public School settings do to thing

1193
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:20,607
Things like Bully

1194
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:25,983
I think it's kind of natural to have some initial reaction to something like this instinct

1195
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:28,543
Maybe this isn't the right solution to the problem

1196
01:08:29,055 --> 01:08:30,847
Like if bullying is the problem then

1197
01:08:31,103 --> 01:08:32,383
Stopping the bullying seems like

1198
01:08:32,639 --> 01:08:33,151
Nothing to do

1199
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:34,687
Opposed to creating a new public

1200
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:36,479
School for the students to go to but that's

1201
01:08:36,735 --> 01:08:40,575
Not as easy as we would like it to be bullying is

1202
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:41,343
Hard

1203
01:08:41,599 --> 01:08:42,111
Yes

1204
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:44,415
So what if we did that point

1205
01:08:44,671 --> 01:08:46,207
The thing where we just moved you out of this

1206
01:08:46,463 --> 01:08:50,559
Situation sure I mean it's a complicated conversations

1207
01:08:50,815 --> 01:08:51,327
I don't

1208
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:52,607
Yeah I don't know

1209
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:57,727
According to the American educational research Association is many as one in three lgbtq

1210
01:08:57,983 --> 01:09:02,847
Cqi school students and sup dropping out while the national average is a 8% dropout rate

1211
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:08,223
Call lgbtq students report that their main reason for dropping out of high school is

1212
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:09,759
Constant bullying and harassment

1213
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:10,783
Another student

1214
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:12,831
So this does seem like

1215
01:09:13,343 --> 01:09:14,623
A possible solution

1216
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:16,159
Into this problem

1217
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:19,743
In God's name could they do this school is not about

1218
01:09:19,999 --> 01:09:25,631
Sex that's why whenever we have all male schools and all female schools

1219
01:09:25,887 --> 01:09:26,655
That is okay

1220
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:33,311
But if there are different orientations that maybe don't apply in those situations that the evil actually you know

1221
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:34,335
What I don't

1222
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:38,687
Know if I've ever heard Alex talk about whether or not

1223
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:41,759
Mail-order all-female schools are okay

1224
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:44,063
I think you would be totally fine with it if their privates

1225
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:46,367
But I don't know what you would think if it was

1226
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:48,159
I don't know if you would actually make it

1227
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:51,231
Distinction between the two Wendy's ranting about something

1228
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:56,351
Play a different conversation between the two are the only reason why

1229
01:09:56,607 --> 01:09:59,679
Has any relevant conversation around it at all because of the public

1230
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:01,471
Wright brothers

1231
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:02,239
You know

1232
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:03,263
I mean

1233
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:05,055
Maybe we have

1234
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:08,895
To stop listening to what conservatives are saying about schools whenever they're like

1235
01:10:09,407 --> 01:10:09,919
Seether teacher

1236
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:12,223
Stop that's not reading writing and arithmetic

1237
01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:18,879
And really understand that I think they're actually angry at the reading the writing in the arithmetic history

1238
01:10:19,135 --> 01:10:23,231
So I looked into it they don't have New World Order study and Harvey Milk

1239
01:10:23,743 --> 01:10:29,887
I looked into this and it seems like the people who go there and work at Harvey Milk are

1240
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:30,911
Plastic about how important

1241
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:33,215
The school is and how it's a really positive learning

1242
01:10:33,471 --> 01:10:33,983
Environment

1243
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:35,519
According to the New York public

1244
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:38,847
Quickschools information on their website they only had 59 in Rhodes

1245
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:40,127
Students this past year

1246
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:41,407
Imitator going back to

1247
01:10:41,663 --> 01:10:43,711
The 2016 the highest of any years 70

1248
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:50,367
Seems like if this is a special occasion where people who be having a terrible time in high school can learn in peace

1249
01:10:50,623 --> 01:10:52,415
I don't know really what the harbor

1250
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:58,815
It's not like they have any different curriculum than any other

1251
01:10:59,071 --> 01:11:01,119
School Board of Regents

1252
01:11:01,631 --> 01:11:05,983
Also important Point here is that the school is not exclusively lgbtq anybody

1253
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:09,567
We can attempt it's not it's not restricted make a restricted

1254
01:11:10,335 --> 01:11:12,127
So just a very basic standpoint

1255
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:13,919
Again Alex shouldn't have a problem with it

1256
01:11:14,175 --> 01:11:16,991
That's because it's the New York State Board of Education deciding to do this

1257
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:18,527
Experimental program

1258
01:11:18,783 --> 01:11:19,551
To see how it works

1259
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:21,855
Alright

1260
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:22,623
And it's still open

1261
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:28,767
There have been other attempts to create high schools that are generally geared towards lgbtq students but they

1262
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:30,047
Not had as much success

1263
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:35,167
There was one plant here in Chicago back in 2008 but that fell through before it got off the ground

1264
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:37,471
School Atlanta open 220si

1265
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:38,495
16 but it closed in

1266
01:11:38,751 --> 01:11:40,799
In 2018 due to dropping a roll

1267
01:11:41,311 --> 01:11:42,847
But that one is interesting

1268
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:44,895
Because it was a private

1269
01:11:45,151 --> 01:11:46,431
Right so that

1270
01:11:47,711 --> 01:11:51,551
You know sort of a different dynamic

1271
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:55,391
Spell through whereas the Harvey Milk school has has indoor

1272
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:57,695
You know is that he's such a great

1273
01:11:57,951 --> 01:11:58,463
Like

1274
01:11:58,975 --> 01:12:01,279
Point of view into the real ID

1275
01:12:01,535 --> 01:12:04,095
The real ideology behind there is it

1276
01:12:04,351 --> 01:12:05,119
It's not listen

1277
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:11,263
If you didn't want your kid every argument every conservatives ever made is like I don't want my kids learning

1278
01:12:11,519 --> 01:12:12,031
With

1279
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:14,335
Lgbtq students

1280
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:17,407
I don't want them in that situation learning things that they couldn't

1281
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:18,431
Okay fine

1282
01:12:18,687 --> 01:12:21,247
So let's make a school for lgbtq

1283
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:22,271
Good students

1284
01:12:22,527 --> 01:12:24,319
And then your kids won't have to deal with it

1285
01:12:24,575 --> 01:12:30,719
No I want that school f****** close to right I want it all taken from that hypothetical

1286
01:12:30,975 --> 01:12:35,839
Coolsense I agree with you that is very revealing although I do think

1287
01:12:36,095 --> 01:12:39,167
Away from even engaging with the thought initially

1288
01:12:39,423 --> 01:12:39,935
Of like

1289
01:12:40,191 --> 01:12:40,703
Let's put

1290
01:12:40,959 --> 01:12:41,983
Them in quotes

1291
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:43,007
Call somewhere else

1292
01:12:43,263 --> 01:12:45,567
Because when you end up with segregated schools

1293
01:12:45,823 --> 01:12:51,199
I'm not talking about

1294
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:53,247
Incase

1295
01:12:53,759 --> 01:12:59,903
That is a bridgeworth I'm using this is an example of

1296
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:02,207
My job to be over clarify sometime

1297
01:13:02,463 --> 01:13:03,743
But it is it is the case

1298
01:13:03,999 --> 01:13:08,095
About wanting to learn about lgbtq

1299
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:09,375
Issues with your

1300
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:11,167
No no it's that they

1301
01:13:11,935 --> 01:13:12,703
Yeah

1302
01:13:13,471 --> 01:13:17,055
You don't want them you don't want them

1303
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:19,103
There you got it

1304
01:13:19,359 --> 01:13:22,943
Alex is really really excited about this kalugin

1305
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:24,991
Coming on

1306
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:25,759
Kalugin

1307
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:27,551
Do you have Howard

1308
01:13:29,343 --> 01:13:31,647
Collusion

1309
01:13:40,351 --> 01:13:40,863
After crying

1310
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:45,471
One of them

1311
01:13:48,543 --> 01:13:49,311
I'm one of the top

1312
01:14:00,063 --> 01:14:06,207
Yasso Michael Savage's one of the Democrat top operatives so funny how we jump back and forth between this time

1313
01:14:06,463 --> 01:14:06,975
. because

1314
01:14:07,231 --> 01:14:09,279
Every single time I'm always like

1315
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:15,935
Michael Savage is a top Democrat out with no I remember now I remember where we are in the storyline of caught-up eunos

1316
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:22,335
Not a legend of the Patriot community and has been for years nobody has a it's a long-haired beatnik who's trying to

1317
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:24,383
She'll for neocon

1318
01:14:25,663 --> 01:14:27,455
The second season of Better Call Saul

1319
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:32,575
He's basically socialism

1320
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:36,415
So Alex touches back on this policy Market

1321
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:37,951
The policy analysis Market

1322
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:42,303
Story and man day after

1323
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:43,071
He told him

1324
01:14:43,327 --> 01:14:43,839
To his face

1325
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:44,863
Auto Show

1326
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:45,887
Not happening

1327
01:14:46,143 --> 01:14:46,655
But it still happen

1328
01:14:46,911 --> 01:14:47,423
Okay

1329
01:14:47,935 --> 01:14:48,703
Good morning

1330
01:14:51,263 --> 01:14:52,543
My wife did

1331
01:14:52,799 --> 01:14:53,567
One of my

1332
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:54,847
Boys dead

1333
01:15:26,591 --> 01:15:27,615
How to talk to

1334
01:15:43,999 --> 01:15:44,511
It was

1335
01:15:50,911 --> 01:15:51,679
On where the next

1336
01:15:57,311 --> 01:15:57,823
Ron

1337
01:16:04,223 --> 01:16:05,247
Market

1338
01:16:05,759 --> 01:16:07,551
Ruined

1339
01:16:10,111 --> 01:16:13,183
Almost everything Alex is saying what the story is completely wrong

1340
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:17,023
The factual stuff is just in Roofing details to make this more interesting as a

1341
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:17,791
The conspiracy

1342
01:16:18,047 --> 01:16:18,559
And things like

1343
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:20,607
Secret passwords just had to do with

1344
01:16:20,863 --> 01:16:22,655
Like people who were investing would have accounts

1345
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:25,727
With that scary

1346
01:16:25,983 --> 01:16:29,567
This is a dead story because of the market that was proposed didn't actually happen

1347
01:16:30,079 --> 01:16:33,407
These two Democratic senators push back on it the project was abandoned

1348
01:16:34,175 --> 01:16:36,223
Because that's the case Alex needs to kind of shift

1349
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:37,247
The tone of his coverage

1350
01:16:37,503 --> 01:16:41,855
That's why the story is now that the market has existed for a while secretly a

1351
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:42,879
Still does exist

1352
01:16:43,135 --> 01:16:44,415
But they're just trying to make it public

1353
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:50,047
The Publican unveiling of the program failed but the program still totally existence Secret

1354
01:16:50,303 --> 01:16:50,815
And Alex

1355
01:16:51,071 --> 01:16:54,655
Definitely proved that he has the documents and it's in the paper so you know it

1356
01:16:54,911 --> 01:17:01,055
Honestly it's basically just your office March Madness pool but blown up you know I'll literally tomorrow

1357
01:17:01,311 --> 01:17:04,127
This is a pretty Savvy because if you didn't

1358
01:17:04,383 --> 01:17:06,943
Do this his narrative would actually be tied to reality

1359
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:09,503
The program will be done for in that fat

1360
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:14,367
Nothing else so it's really see here that the government actually work the way he claims he wants it

1361
01:17:15,135 --> 01:17:16,415
Is the conspiracy dead at

1362
01:17:16,671 --> 01:17:22,815
So if you want to get mileage out of this wood you've already spent a day trying to get up you have to change the story of James

1363
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:27,679
Yeah and what's important is not that you theoretically quote-unquote one

1364
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:30,751
You were against this policy now this probably seashell

1365
01:17:31,007 --> 01:17:34,335
You're not going to go and be like hey we did it

1366
01:17:35,103 --> 01:17:35,615
Yuan

1367
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:36,383
Reinforce

1368
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:37,663
Thing that you and your listeners

1369
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:38,431
Did something

1370
01:17:38,943 --> 01:17:39,711
Is way worse

1371
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:41,759
Then telling them that you are doing

1372
01:17:42,015 --> 01:17:44,575
I bet you were continuing to do something

1373
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:47,391
And that nothing you ever do will end in a victory

1374
01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:48,927
But we're always going to keep going

1375
01:17:51,487 --> 01:17:52,767
So Alex

1376
01:17:53,023 --> 01:17:54,815
It over there sometimes cute moments

1377
01:17:55,327 --> 01:17:56,863
Might be a little bit

1378
01:18:20,927 --> 01:18:21,695
Michael

1379
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:26,303
Coffee

1380
01:18:26,815 --> 01:18:28,607
Mike Walker

1381
01:18:48,063 --> 01:18:48,575
By the way

1382
01:18:52,671 --> 01:18:53,183
Okay

1383
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:56,255
Just drink your f****** a dozen everything cuz it has

1384
01:18:56,511 --> 01:18:58,815
To be everything I'm pretty sure they also already

1385
01:18:59,071 --> 01:19:02,143
Xgolf

1386
01:19:03,423 --> 01:19:07,007
Also 15 month olds are definitely not prescribed brutal

1387
01:19:07,263 --> 01:19:13,407
It hasn't been approved for people under 6 though in some extreme cases it can be prescribed to people

1388
01:19:13,663 --> 01:19:15,967
Over the age of three but that's going to be pretty rare

1389
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:22,623
Hope it's really funny to see how it's making a big deal about a dangerous of a drug coffee is and who needs to quit considering Israel

1390
01:19:22,879 --> 01:19:23,903
Alcohol abuse

1391
01:19:25,183 --> 01:19:26,463
Problem with stimulants

1392
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:29,279
In recent days

1393
01:19:29,535 --> 01:19:30,303
Okay

1394
01:19:30,559 --> 01:19:31,071
On the stove

1395
01:19:32,607 --> 01:19:33,631
Who's next clip

1396
01:19:33,887 --> 01:19:36,447
I think it's sort of tracking

1397
01:19:36,703 --> 01:19:37,215
An underage

1398
01:19:37,471 --> 01:19:38,239
Wait hold on

1399
01:19:38,495 --> 01:19:43,103
Am I am I wrong in thinking that one of his products is

1400
01:19:43,615 --> 01:19:44,127
Coffee

1401
01:19:44,383 --> 01:19:50,527
Yeah he sells the wakeupamerica blend the Chiapas Farmers yeah

1402
01:19:50,783 --> 01:19:56,927
Product has a s*** ton of caffeine in it as a bunch of weird like pseudo stimulants sure the ones

1403
01:19:57,183 --> 01:20:01,023
You up

1404
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:02,815
Brain Force Ultra

1405
01:20:03,071 --> 01:20:06,911
Brought you back before you read between timeline trying to get off coffee

1406
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:08,191
But in my head I'm like

1407
01:20:08,447 --> 01:20:10,495
Wait aren't you about to do an ad for coffee

1408
01:20:10,751 --> 01:20:13,824
I'm not sure if he's selling coffee at this point yet but I

1409
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:16,384
It was before the subject I think so

1410
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:22,016
Before he gets all of his line of bull caffeine and other associated

1411
01:20:22,272 --> 01:20:23,552
The like

1412
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:25,344
Yeah yeah

1413
01:20:25,856 --> 01:20:26,368
Oh well

1414
01:20:26,624 --> 01:20:27,648
Also Alex

1415
01:20:29,184 --> 01:20:32,768
Does not limit himself to coffee

1416
01:20:34,816 --> 01:20:36,352
And this

1417
01:20:36,608 --> 01:20:38,144
Sort of a part of a path

1418
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:39,680
That we've been going down

1419
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:40,448
And that is

1420
01:20:40,704 --> 01:20:41,984
You know it started very exciting

1421
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:46,080
No because we met someone named Dan from Illinois

1422
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:47,360
Turns out he calls in

1423
01:20:47,616 --> 01:20:50,176
All the f****** time

1424
01:20:50,432 --> 01:20:56,576
More and more out of love with him

1425
01:21:02,464 --> 01:21:03,232
How you doing

1426
01:21:04,256 --> 01:21:06,560
Mister Ed the way you're saying a minute ago it's a mess

1427
01:21:06,816 --> 01:21:08,096
Sabri definition of Acts

1428
01:21:08,608 --> 01:21:09,120
The bull Behavior

1429
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:26,784
What

1430
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:28,064
Wait what

1431
01:21:42,144 --> 01:21:44,960
That sounds fairly close to his modern ship

1432
01:21:46,496 --> 01:21:47,520
Does he think that their tea

1433
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:48,288
Teaching

1434
01:21:48,544 --> 01:21:49,312
Yes okay

1435
01:21:49,824 --> 01:21:51,104
Yeah that's what I thought

1436
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:51,872
And I couldn't

1437
01:21:52,128 --> 01:21:57,504
I couldn't believe for a real second somebody would do that

1438
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:02,624
No teaching gay stuff

1439
01:22:03,136 --> 01:22:04,416
Over over over the pants

1440
01:22:06,208 --> 01:22:07,232

And I got to say I was looking at everything I can tell

1444
01:22:18,496 --> 01:22:21,568
He seems like he's just your kind of run-of-the-mill shady lawyer

1445
01:22:21,824 --> 01:22:25,920
Who was also involved in recalling the governor and then he also had a failed Senate run

1446
01:22:26,176 --> 01:22:27,200
He's the chair of the

1447
01:22:27,456 --> 01:22:31,808
Recall Gray Davis committee though it should be noted that another member of that committee

1448
01:22:32,064 --> 01:22:34,368
Was Notorious pollster Frank Luntz

1449
01:22:34,624 --> 01:22:36,672
Who who Alex is currently obsessed with suggest

1450
01:22:36,928 --> 01:22:38,464
Things in a relationship with Kevin McCarthy

1451
01:22:39,232 --> 01:22:39,744
They live together

1452
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:43,840
Weird also dipping around inclusions history 100 interesting tidbit

1453
01:22:44,864 --> 01:22:48,192
2004 parently he was heading a campaign to block theaters

1454
01:22:48,704 --> 01:22:51,264
From playing Michael Moore's movie Fahrenheit 911

1455
01:22:51,776 --> 01:22:53,056
There's a very impassioned

1456
01:22:53,312 --> 01:22:57,152
Stop it that I found calling out clued-in and supporting Michael Moore

1457
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:58,944
From that article quote

1458
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:05,344
Colombians arm-twisting organization move America forward his called Moore's film a recruiting video for LK

1459
01:23:05,856 --> 01:23:07,648
In other words more is a terrorist

1460
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:14,304
It should be more than obvious by now that what far right-wingers like a loogie in Ashcroft want done to those they

1461
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:15,072
They considered

1462
01:23:15,584 --> 01:23:17,888
Or for that matter those who disagree with bush

1463
01:23:18,912 --> 01:23:20,192
The writer of that op-ed

1464
01:23:20,448 --> 01:23:24,032
Alex is a longtime writer and one-time webmaster curtain MO

1465
01:23:24,288 --> 01:23:25,568
Rating on his own blog

1466
01:23:26,848 --> 01:23:28,128
Yep what

1467
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:30,176
No another fun fact

1468
01:23:30,432 --> 01:23:36,576
Bylines on globalresearch.ca from 2004 all the way up to the present day

1469
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:43,744
Happening with memo after this interview

1470
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,304
Kurt Nimmo wrote an article Love by Sting

1471
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:47,840
Collusion

1472
01:23:48,352 --> 01:23:49,376
As a free speech

1473
01:23:49,632 --> 01:23:51,680
Unreal is happening

1474
01:23:53,216 --> 01:23:56,288
Clue game comes in and they have real fun

1475
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:58,080
Jocularity

1476
01:24:02,432 --> 01:24:03,200
Open border promoting

1477
01:24:10,624 --> 01:24:11,904
Are we going to get

1478
01:24:13,696 --> 01:24:14,464
Or we going to get

1479
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:16,512
Winning

1480
01:24:16,768 --> 01:24:19,072
Or will they Michael

1481
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:26,752
Howard

1482
01:24:29,824 --> 01:24:30,592
Thank you very much

1483
01:24:31,104 --> 01:24:31,616
To be with you today

1484
01:24:39,552 --> 01:24:41,088
Breaking down

1485
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:44,160
About me I'm an attorney

1486
01:24:50,304 --> 01:24:56,448
Really cute of the two of them were getting along pretty well and have this fake laugh because they would absolutely f****** hate each other if they knew it

1487
01:24:56,704 --> 01:24:58,240
What the other one stood for

1488
01:24:58,496 --> 01:25:01,568
Case-in-point Kluge and is super in favor of the war in Iraq

1489
01:25:02,336 --> 01:25:08,480
In 2005 he was so into in the enduring war that he began organization called moving America forward

1490
01:25:08,736 --> 01:25:10,016
Along with Sal Russo

1491
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:15,392
A political Communications and strategy guy was also a key member of the recall Gray Davis committee

1492
01:25:15,648 --> 01:25:16,672
The new group was meant

1493
01:25:16,928 --> 01:25:20,768
To quote report the good news on operation Iraqi Freedom you're not hearing from the

1494
01:25:21,024 --> 01:25:23,072
The old line news media

1495
01:25:23,328 --> 01:25:24,352
This led to an embarrassing

1496
01:25:24,608 --> 01:25:26,912
F****** where collusion posted a picture of a quiet

1497
01:25:27,168 --> 01:25:28,448
Street and claimed that it was Baghdad

1498
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:32,544
You're trying to make the argument that the war was super effective and Brian going great

1499
01:25:33,312 --> 01:25:34,848
It also turned out that this was a straw

1500
01:25:35,104 --> 01:25:35,872
Street in Istanbul

1501
01:25:36,128 --> 01:25:40,480
Google in a classic right-wing move would go on to blame a staffer for the f***

1502
01:25:40,736 --> 01:25:46,880
Can't believe it how many goddamn people

1503
01:25:47,648 --> 01:25:53,792
Position to free speech of David Michael Moore and also

1504
01:25:54,048 --> 01:25:54,816
Party

1505
01:25:55,328 --> 01:25:56,864
By starting a bus tour called the

1506
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:57,888
Tea party Express

1507
01:25:58,144 --> 01:25:58,912
Switch tried to

1508
01:25:59,168 --> 01:26:04,288
Get Doom candidates elected in the raise a bunch of money that got funnel two organizations run by caloocan

1509
01:26:04,544 --> 01:26:06,592
And his longtime collaborator Rousseau

1510
01:26:06,848 --> 01:26:07,872
Yeah that's the waited

1511
01:26:08,384 --> 01:26:12,992
Steal the face mask for the Tea Party Express with a radio host named Mark Williams

1512
01:26:13,248 --> 01:26:14,272
Or at least it was

1513
01:26:14,528 --> 01:26:19,392
Until he had some controversy about a racist letter that he posted on his website

1514
01:26:19,904 --> 01:26:21,440
Actually that's not totally accurate

1515
01:26:21,696 --> 01:26:23,232
He didn't end up stepping down from the

1516
01:26:23,488 --> 01:26:24,256
Party Express

1517
01:26:24,768 --> 01:26:27,584
The national tea party Federation said that.

1518
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:29,888
Tea party Express needed the fire Williams for the

1519
01:26:30,144 --> 01:26:32,192
Clearly racist letter and they refused to

1520
01:26:32,448 --> 01:26:33,472
So the national

1521
01:26:33,728 --> 01:26:36,288
Expelled them from the formal

1522
01:26:36,544 --> 01:26:39,616
Wow when did they let him back in

1523
01:26:40,384 --> 01:26:43,456
Super letter was written from the perspective of freed and slave person

1524
01:26:43,712 --> 01:26:47,552
No a ham Lincoln

1525
01:26:47,808 --> 01:26:49,088
Excuse me sir excuse me

1526
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:51,904
I'm going to read you a little bit about God no quote

1527
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:54,976
Mister Lincoln you are the greatest racist ever

1528
01:26:55,232 --> 01:26:58,048
We had a great gig

1529
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:01,376
Okay alright squares

1530
01:27:01,632 --> 01:27:05,216
Room & Board all of our decisions made by Massa in the house

1531
01:27:05,728 --> 01:27:08,800
We coloreds have taken a vote and decided that we don't cotton

1532
01:27:09,056 --> 01:27:10,336
Into the whole emancipation thing

1533
01:27:10,848 --> 01:27:15,712
Freedom means having to work for real think for ourselves and take consequences along with the rewards

1534
01:27:15,968 --> 01:27:16,480
That's just

1535
01:27:16,736 --> 01:27:19,808
Far too much to ask of us colored people and we demand that it's

1536
01:27:20,064 --> 01:27:20,576
Stop

1537
01:27:21,344 --> 01:27:21,856
Yeah

1538
01:27:22,112 --> 01:27:22,880
Holyshit

1539
01:27:23,392 --> 01:27:23,904
Insane

1540
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:24,672
That is

1541
01:27:25,184 --> 01:27:25,696
Bonkers

1542
01:27:26,208 --> 01:27:28,000
Yep that's bad stuff

1543
01:27:28,256 --> 01:27:31,328
And this is the dude that Kluge and was willing to go to bed for so that's

1544
01:27:32,096 --> 01:27:37,472
Also in response to be proposed Ground Zero mosque this guy Williams said that it would be quote

1545
01:27:37,728 --> 01:27:38,496
For the worship of the

1546
01:27:38,752 --> 01:27:40,032
The terrorist monkey god

1547
01:27:40,544 --> 01:27:44,896
Which apparently also wasn't enough for him by to get in trouble with Tea Party Express

1548
01:27:45,152 --> 01:27:51,296
Anyway the point is the klujian loves the Iraq War hates free speech and was an active part of trying to Krypton the Tea Party into way there

1549
01:27:51,552 --> 01:27:53,088
Really serve to worsen the parts of

1550
01:27:53,344 --> 01:27:56,672
The community that were an embarrassment in the eyes of the larger population

1551
01:27:56,928 --> 01:27:58,720
Probably hurt a number their candidates at

1552
01:27:58,976 --> 01:28:01,024
The poles and Alex should really f******

1553
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:01,792
I hate this dude

1554
01:28:02,048 --> 01:28:04,864
Right I mean long-term though that was the right move

1555
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:05,632
Well

1556
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:07,168
Sure.

1557
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:09,728
I mean there

1558
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:13,568
It's sort of an accidental victory

1559
01:28:14,848 --> 01:28:20,480
Galaxy W stands for a lot of things that Alex Indiana should be very much against

1560
01:28:20,736 --> 01:28:22,528
All he knows about him is that he's against

1561
01:28:22,784 --> 01:28:26,880
Spray Davis and souls like yeah f*** yeah I'm into this

1562
01:28:27,136 --> 01:28:28,672
It is so much like that

1563
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:31,744
There are so many false equivalencies that we can make

1564
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:37,632
Between America and Russia is all that s*** right there but the one thing that is always true is that

1565
01:28:37,888 --> 01:28:39,680
There are weirdo right wing

1566
01:28:39,936 --> 01:28:41,216
Assholes who are going to be like

1567
01:28:41,472 --> 01:28:41,984
Listen

1568
01:28:42,496 --> 01:28:44,032
Our government is not hurting it

1569
01:28:44,544 --> 01:28:46,848
I promise you everything's great

1570
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:52,224
No I don't know are they paying me know that's the weirdest part of this I'm doing it for free

1571
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:58,112
But not them who should be paid

1572
01:28:58,368 --> 01:28:59,392
For you

1573
01:28:59,904 --> 01:29:00,672
Zoo

1574
01:29:00,928 --> 01:29:03,232
Alex gets to espousing some ideas

1575
01:29:03,488 --> 01:29:08,608
About Gray Davis and electoral politics in California and this is really incoherent

1576
01:29:15,008 --> 01:29:15,520
But you asked

1577
01:29:24,224 --> 01:29:25,248
Now that were true at all

1578
01:29:26,272 --> 01:29:27,296
Be possible for Gray Davis

1579
01:29:27,552 --> 01:29:28,064
To be one of them

1580
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:30,368
Four governors in the history of the United States

1581
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:32,416
Too Faced a recall election

1582
01:29:32,928 --> 01:29:34,464
Hoody at all these illegal vote

1583
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:38,560
Rigging elections why did Erie get so you'll be one of only two governors

1584
01:29:38,816 --> 01:29:41,376
In US history to actually be recalled

1585
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:45,216
It seems like a really dumb use a power that I was pretending that he wield

1586
01:29:45,728 --> 01:29:51,616
Play Just Because Alex's position isn't sincere it's just a xenophobia and racism you just don't understand

1587
01:29:53,152 --> 01:29:56,480
Yeah you're right you're right

1588
01:29:56,736 --> 01:30:02,368
You're right I'm saying the collusion and his friends were decision-makers in term for the Tea Party

1589
01:30:02,624 --> 01:30:08,000
But it turns out in the long run you're right

1590
01:30:08,512 --> 01:30:09,024
You're not

1591
01:30:09,792 --> 01:30:10,816
Colludium

1592
01:30:11,072 --> 01:30:12,608
He's got some some

1593
01:30:12,864 --> 01:30:14,912
F****** weird ideas about America

1594
01:30:15,168 --> 01:30:16,704
Sprint Center

1595
01:30:21,824 --> 01:30:22,336
First time

1596
01:30:22,592 --> 01:30:23,360
North Dakota

1597
01:30:26,944 --> 01:30:33,088
You know what I hate that man I hate all these Democratic Coastal Elites looking down on flyover country

1598
01:30:33,344 --> 01:30:39,488
California Liberals are

1599
01:30:39,744 --> 01:30:45,888
These upstanding right-wing Patriots standing up and caring about what happens in middle of America

1600
01:30:51,008 --> 01:30:51,520
Say that

1601
01:30:51,776 --> 01:30:53,312
No no no they wouldn't just discount

1602
01:30:53,568 --> 01:30:54,080
Massive

1603
01:30:54,336 --> 01:30:57,664
Amount of geography based solely upon their own

1604
01:30:57,920 --> 01:31:01,760
Bigotries in lack of care that would be silly Coastal Elite

1605
01:31:02,016 --> 01:31:03,296
Yeah

1606
01:31:03,552 --> 01:31:04,064
Dakota

1607
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:09,440
Count I mean there aren't and it's not like there any Coastal least in the Republican party you would have to go from what

1608
01:31:09,696 --> 01:31:10,464
Beyond like

1609
01:31:10,976 --> 01:31:12,512
Say one of those schools on the

1610
01:31:12,768 --> 01:31:15,584
East Coast like Harvard or Yale or something like that

1611
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:19,168
Or one of the schools on the west coast like Stanford or that you know

1612
01:31:19,424 --> 01:31:21,728
We don't have a lot of Republicans from those schools right.

1613
01:31:25,568 --> 01:31:26,080
Dumb

1614
01:31:26,336 --> 01:31:27,104
April

1615
01:31:28,384 --> 01:31:28,896
So

1616
01:31:29,152 --> 01:31:30,688
Alex also is a little

1617
01:31:30,944 --> 01:31:31,712
Dumb

1618
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:32,992
Every governor

1619
01:31:34,272 --> 01:31:35,040
Including Ronald Reagan

1620
01:31:35,552 --> 01:31:36,064
Jerry Brown

1621
01:31:39,648 --> 01:31:40,928
Has had a recall app

1622
01:31:41,696 --> 01:31:42,208
Begun

1623
01:31:43,232 --> 01:31:44,000
Not one

1624
01:31:44,256 --> 01:31:44,768
Has it ever got

1625
01:31:47,584 --> 01:31:48,352
Because never

1626
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:52,960
The brink of bacon

1627
01:32:00,384 --> 01:32:01,920
I'm not familiar enough with that

1628
01:32:02,432 --> 01:32:03,200
You know what I hate

1629
01:32:03,456 --> 01:32:03,968
Are you going to be

1630
01:32:04,224 --> 01:32:08,576
Democrat liberal socialist have no idea what the Constitution actually says

1631
01:32:09,088 --> 01:32:14,976
Stampy's Dum Dum left-wingers out here spouting nonsense about what they think the country is about

1632
01:32:15,232 --> 01:32:19,072
Patriots like Alex you like live and breathe our country's founding

1633
01:32:20,352 --> 01:32:24,704
Honest sincere note according to the Constitution you cannot recall people elected to Federal position

1634
01:32:25,216 --> 01:32:25,728
Houdini

1635
01:32:25,984 --> 01:32:29,824
Possible for the people of Arizona to recall McCain without first getting an amendment passed

1636
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:30,592
That would come

1637
01:32:30,848 --> 01:32:33,664
Completely overhaul election rules on a national level

1638
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:35,968
Alex has no idea what he's talking about

1639
01:32:36,224 --> 01:32:37,760
Just throwing out whatever bulshit he wants

1640
01:32:38,016 --> 01:32:40,576
How to make the show interesting even if it violates the

1641
01:32:40,832 --> 01:32:42,624
F****** c*** pretty close though

1642
01:32:44,928 --> 01:32:48,512
I know you think that just cuz they're more steps than he assumed

1643
01:32:48,768 --> 01:32:54,912
Means that he's wrong but they ain't he think you can still be pretty close to Morse not it's not more steps

1644
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:59,008
You have to get a national accounts

1645
01:32:59,264 --> 01:33:05,408
The distance between those steps you could not make

1646
01:33:09,248 --> 01:33:11,296
Yeah we're going to recall this Center

1647
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:12,832
Alright

1648
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:14,368
All right we got to get

1649
01:33:14,624 --> 01:33:20,000
McCade okay so let's get let's get him out of there let's do a recall no we can't do that cuz it causes you to remember that

1650
01:33:20,256 --> 01:33:23,840
Well how do we change that you want to change the Constitution is how we will of the Constitution

1651
01:33:24,096 --> 01:33:25,376
Whatever you need to

1652
01:33:25,888 --> 01:33:26,656
You can

1653
01:33:28,192 --> 01:33:30,496
I just decided I don't even know what to say

1654
01:33:30,752 --> 01:33:32,032
He loves the Constitution wanted

1655
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:33,312
So this

1656
01:33:33,568 --> 01:33:34,336
Recall is going

1657
01:33:34,592 --> 01:33:35,360
Went down right

1658
01:33:35,616 --> 01:33:38,688
It's at the way it's structured as there is one election

1659
01:33:38,944 --> 01:33:39,456
That's going to happen

1660
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:41,760
Things on the ballot

1661
01:33:42,016 --> 01:33:45,088
One is should Greg Davis be recalled

1662
01:33:45,344 --> 01:33:48,416
As if so which of these people should replace

1663
01:33:48,672 --> 01:33:49,696
So if the fur

1664
01:33:49,952 --> 01:33:50,976
First measure passes

1665
01:33:51,232 --> 01:33:52,512
Then the second question will come

1666
01:33:52,768 --> 01:33:54,048
Going to play if it doesn't

1667
01:33:54,304 --> 01:33:55,328
Then Gray Davis taisen.

1668
01:33:55,584 --> 01:34:01,472
Little bit about

1669
01:34:01,728 --> 01:34:03,008
In the race

1670
01:34:03,776 --> 01:34:04,544
It might surprise you

1671
01:34:08,896 --> 01:34:09,408
Leah

1672
01:34:23,232 --> 01:34:23,744
And he had

1673
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:24,512
Division

1674
01:34:25,024 --> 01:34:26,816
For the recall

1675
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:28,096
Provided

1676
01:34:29,632 --> 01:34:31,168
Significant

1677
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:38,080
The job

1678
01:34:44,224 --> 01:34:44,736
However I do

1679
01:34:44,992 --> 01:34:46,528
Arnold Schwarzenegger

1680
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:52,416
About that prediction that didn't run also we do for Matt Drudge

1681
01:34:52,928 --> 01:34:56,000
That Isis was named as a joke

1682
01:34:56,768 --> 01:34:58,048
That's how they close

1683
01:34:58,304 --> 01:35:00,352
What's are playing or something it's weird how they do that

1684
01:35:00,608 --> 01:35:04,448
Run

1685
01:35:04,704 --> 01:35:05,472
Call election

1686
01:35:05,984 --> 01:35:07,008
Because of

1687
01:35:07,264 --> 01:35:11,872
Suspicions and accusations that were made about his early organization

1688
01:35:12,128 --> 01:35:13,920
Over the recall campaign

1689
01:35:14,176 --> 01:35:18,784
Talking about situations

1690
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:20,064
He funded early effort

1691
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:21,088
Recall going

1692
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:23,392
For himself to be able to run

1693
01:35:24,928 --> 01:35:29,024
I was a little bit of hot water and so he withdrew from the race

1694
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:30,304
Because that definitely was

1695
01:35:30,816 --> 01:35:33,120
Is collusion here himself is saying

1696
01:35:33,376 --> 01:35:38,496
Of course the volunteer effort would have no effect if it weren't for this guy's always know that does sound

1697
01:35:38,752 --> 01:35:43,616
His prediction clue games is that I said I was going to run

1698
01:35:43,872 --> 01:35:44,640
Schwarzenegger is not

1699
01:35:44,896 --> 01:35:45,664
Wrong on two

1700
01:35:46,688 --> 01:35:48,224
Navigate to the idea about Savage

1701
01:35:48,992 --> 01:35:52,064
Michael Savage of the Savage independent

1702
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:53,856
Lugia

1703
01:35:56,928 --> 01:35:57,696
Weiner

1704
01:35:59,488 --> 01:36:00,000
Running

1705
01:36:04,352 --> 01:36:05,376
Wouldn't

1706
01:36:08,192 --> 01:36:09,216
The more conservative

1707
01:36:09,472 --> 01:36:10,240
Ram

1708
01:36:30,208 --> 01:36:31,232
I like how you can be

1709
01:36:31,744 --> 01:36:33,024
Almost patronizing

1710
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:37,376
And wrong and patronizing and right in the same clip yeah that's nice

1711
01:36:37,632 --> 01:36:41,472
And also just have a clear like I do enjoy it when guests

1712
01:36:41,728 --> 01:36:47,872
Clearly don't know anything about the narratives Alex is trying to build an accidentally completely deflate

1713
01:36:48,128 --> 01:36:50,944
Silly

1714
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:52,480
You're pushing as like a legitimate

1715
01:36:52,736 --> 01:36:57,856
Possibility I hate you need to be worried about because it's a globalist plan right at sea

1716
01:36:58,368 --> 01:37:01,696
It is it is always fun whenever people are like

1717
01:37:02,208 --> 01:37:04,256
Unaware of their responsibilities

1718
01:37:04,512 --> 01:37:05,024
Either roll

1719
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:08,864
Everybody is always aware like all the good Alex guess they're like

1720
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:10,144
Yes absolutely

1721
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:11,680
And here's what I have that you know that

1722
01:37:11,936 --> 01:37:12,960
Yes and all the way

1723
01:37:13,216 --> 01:37:18,848
But every time somebody is like no we're having

1724
01:37:19,104 --> 01:37:21,408
Obviously Michael Savage's and going to run

1725
01:37:21,664 --> 01:37:22,432
That's silly

1726
01:37:22,688 --> 01:37:24,224
Only a fool would believe that

1727
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:30,624
What kind of show would have something like that all caps

1728
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:33,696
To have some sort of Nefarious purpose behind

1729
01:37:33,952 --> 01:37:34,976
Suggestion

1730
01:37:35,232 --> 01:37:41,376
To this interview Tidings of a coming recall election

1731
01:37:41,632 --> 01:37:46,240
Tower and

1732
01:37:47,264 --> 01:37:49,568
Billy shears

1733
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:55,456
Let me hear

1734
01:37:55,712 --> 01:37:57,504
Okay

1735
01:37:57,760 --> 01:38:01,344
So I didn't have the other lyrics but

1736
01:38:01,856 --> 01:38:03,648
I do think he goes by Billy shears

1737
01:38:08,256 --> 01:38:12,352
But he is a guy who has a radio show and Alex

1738
01:38:12,608 --> 01:38:14,144
Is a guest on it sometime

1739
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:17,216
This is a little quid pro quo sure

1740
01:38:17,472 --> 01:38:19,008
The guy who

1741
01:38:19,776 --> 01:38:22,592
Boring AM radio.

1742
01:38:23,104 --> 01:38:27,200
You'll shoot the s*** for a little while with Alex on his show and then go back to his own

1743
01:38:27,456 --> 01:38:30,016
Hometown

1744
01:38:30,272 --> 01:38:31,808
Cast out of 100

1745
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:32,832
Torch

1746
01:38:33,344 --> 01:38:36,672
Or whatever that radio stations blowtorch

1747
01:38:36,928 --> 01:38:37,952
All right but

1748
01:38:38,208 --> 01:38:40,000
Meaningless

1749
01:38:40,256 --> 01:38:45,888
Let's just talk about how great they are another break all the stories in the world

1750
01:38:46,144 --> 01:38:48,192
And some calls

1751
01:38:48,448 --> 01:38:50,752
Did you get this one called I think it's fascinating

1752
01:38:51,008 --> 01:38:51,520
And

1753
01:38:53,056 --> 01:38:53,568
Woodplay

1754
01:38:53,824 --> 01:38:54,336
All of it

1755
01:38:54,592 --> 01:38:55,104
But it

1756
01:38:56,128 --> 01:38:59,200
Its pretty long and there's also part of it the kind of

1757
01:38:59,712 --> 01:39:00,736
VR around and

1758
01:39:00,992 --> 01:39:02,016
It's it's

1759
01:39:02,272 --> 01:39:02,784
Circuitous

1760
01:39:03,296 --> 01:39:06,880
But the beginning of this call is essentially this guy saying like hey

1761
01:39:07,392 --> 01:39:07,904
Alex

1762
01:39:08,672 --> 01:39:10,720
I wanted to I wanted to bring this up to you

1763
01:39:12,256 --> 01:39:13,024
I think

1764
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:15,328
That if you actually engaged with

1765
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:17,120
Some of the

1766
01:39:17,632 --> 01:39:19,936
Material is being put out by left-leaning folks

1767
01:39:20,192 --> 01:39:21,984
And a lot of socialist organization

1768
01:39:22,240 --> 01:39:25,568
They're actually complaining about a lot of the same stuff you are right

1769
01:39:25,824 --> 01:39:31,456
Analysis responses basically like yeah

1770
01:39:31,712 --> 01:39:34,528
Oh that's not actually true

1771
01:39:34,784 --> 01:39:36,064
Go to break

1772
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:39,136
Come back now sexually goes back to this guy

1773
01:39:39,392 --> 01:39:42,208
All right I just don't think Alex can handle

1774
01:39:42,464 --> 01:39:44,000
This kind of

1775
01:39:44,512 --> 01:39:47,584
A conversation nowhere2go with

1776
01:39:51,680 --> 01:39:52,448
Razors Edge

1777
01:39:56,544 --> 01:39:57,568
Publications that I read

1778
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:12,160
Dressed up their schemes for

1779
01:40:12,672 --> 01:40:14,464
Destroying the Constitution the Bill of Rights

1780
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:16,768
Punching I sent the warmers for Empire

1781
01:40:17,024 --> 01:40:18,048
The name of it

1782
01:41:05,408 --> 01:41:06,944
People like Irving kristol

1783
01:41:09,504 --> 01:41:11,040
I need the address

1784
01:41:11,296 --> 01:41:14,112
Ciar opportunist

1785
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:18,464
To become anti,

1786
01:41:44,576 --> 01:41:47,392
Yeah that's that is that is really telling

1787
01:41:47,648 --> 01:41:51,744
The caller actually has exactly Alex's number

1788
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,816
That is the point that he's making is Irving kristol

1789
01:41:55,072 --> 01:41:56,864
Did involve himself

1790
01:41:57,120 --> 01:41:58,912
In some trotskyite

1791
01:41:59,168 --> 01:42:00,960
Thought before ending up

1792
01:42:01,216 --> 01:42:01,984
Beginning the

1793
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:02,752
New York

1794
01:42:03,008 --> 01:42:05,824
Conservative ideology

1795
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:07,872
And because the sounds like this

1796
01:42:08,128 --> 01:42:10,432
What does not characterize the entirety of

1797
01:42:10,944 --> 01:42:11,712
Did this

1798
01:42:11,968 --> 01:42:13,760
This whole philosophy that you are

1799
01:42:14,016 --> 01:42:17,600
You're anything in this Library that's not defining of the neocon

1800
01:42:18,624 --> 01:42:19,392
This one

1801
01:42:19,648 --> 01:42:20,928
This one detail you can

1802
01:42:21,184 --> 01:42:22,208
Extrapolate out

1803
01:42:24,512 --> 01:42:27,840
Insinuates that you just can't see past the Paradigm that I

1804
01:42:28,096 --> 01:42:32,448
Can see I mean I I heard the big moment happen whenever

1805
01:42:32,704 --> 01:42:33,216
He was like

1806
01:42:33,728 --> 01:42:35,520
You realize that there

1807
01:42:35,776 --> 01:42:37,312
Dressing this all up in the

1808
01:42:37,824 --> 01:42:39,360
Guys of anti-communism

1809
01:42:39,616 --> 01:42:44,224
And Alex cut him off immediately because all I heard was him being like

1810
01:42:44,736 --> 01:42:48,832
Yeah that's what the virtues have been trying to do they know you're you're right

1811
01:42:49,088 --> 01:42:55,232
That's what we're doing but I'm not going to say that's what we're doing. Because that's what the neocon

1812
01:42:55,488 --> 01:42:56,000
Against

1813
01:42:56,256 --> 01:42:57,024
Total eclipse

1814
01:42:57,280 --> 01:42:58,048
Yep by

1815
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:01,120
So we get another call and that's actual do is actually far more

1816
01:43:03,936 --> 01:43:04,704
2 mi

1817
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:05,472
Infowars

1818
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:08,032
My car here

1819
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:09,312
Petition

1820
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:14,432
People

1821
01:43:14,688 --> 01:43:15,456
Won't

1822
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:22,112
Turn off

1823
01:43:23,136 --> 01:43:23,648
I had mine

1824
01:43:25,184 --> 01:43:25,952
Sticker

1825
01:43:28,512 --> 01:43:29,280
And then

1826
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:31,840
Now here in College Station

1827
01:43:35,424 --> 01:43:36,704
You are what your about

1828
01:43:50,528 --> 01:43:56,672
Yeah probably

1829
01:43:56,928 --> 01:44:03,072
Homeland Security

1830
01:44:03,328 --> 01:44:03,840
It's so obvious

1831
01:44:04,352 --> 01:44:06,144
Back that is almost a

1832
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:06,912
Parody

1833
01:44:10,496 --> 01:44:11,008
Is

1834
01:44:11,264 --> 01:44:12,288
Absurd

1835
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:16,640
Somebody calling in with the pettiest of nonsense and meaningless

1836
01:44:17,152 --> 01:44:19,968
Vandalism let's save to be very generous

1837
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:20,992
And it's a

1838
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:24,576
Talking conspiracy that involves the department of the federal government

1839
01:44:26,368 --> 01:44:26,880
You got it

1840
01:44:27,136 --> 01:44:33,280
No the other day somebody stole my bike and the reason is obviously because Pam was shut down

1841
01:44:33,536 --> 01:44:34,304
20 years ago

1842
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:36,096
That was the whole idea by

1843
01:44:36,608 --> 01:44:38,144
So they had to get my bikes

1844
01:44:38,656 --> 01:44:39,424
Damn brutal

1845
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:40,192
What

1846
01:44:40,704 --> 01:44:41,472
I just

1847
01:44:42,240 --> 01:44:43,008
Amazing way to

1848
01:44:46,336 --> 01:44:46,848
Really depressing

1849
01:44:47,104 --> 01:44:47,616
What's that about

1850
01:44:48,128 --> 01:44:48,640
Well

1851
01:44:48,896 --> 01:44:50,176
I just had a birthday

1852
01:44:50,432 --> 01:44:51,456
Yeah and you

1853
01:44:51,968 --> 01:44:52,736
Am having a birthday

1854
01:44:52,992 --> 01:44:55,552
That right age is maybe on our minds

1855
01:44:55,808 --> 01:44:56,320
Astro

1856
01:44:58,112 --> 01:44:59,648
I don't know how to break this to you

1857
01:45:04,768 --> 01:45:05,280
Republic

1858
01:45:11,424 --> 01:45:12,960
Thriftbooks.com

1859
01:45:13,472 --> 01:45:15,264
On the year 4/8 but backed up

1860
01:45:15,776 --> 01:45:19,616
A basic question I have to leave it to us are you

1861
01:45:19,872 --> 01:45:22,176
Station Liberty Lobby website

1862
01:45:22,432 --> 01:45:24,992
Great work

1863
01:45:30,368 --> 01:45:30,880
100

1864
01:45:31,904 --> 01:45:32,672
Spin-off

1865
01:45:38,048 --> 01:45:38,560
Verizon

1866
01:45:41,376 --> 01:45:41,888
Goddamn

1867
01:45:42,144 --> 01:45:43,168
It's so wild

1868
01:45:43,424 --> 01:45:45,216
Just have a reminder that Alex's

1869
01:45:45,472 --> 01:45:49,568
22 you ever do you ever like everytime you go back and you look at like

1870
01:45:50,848 --> 01:45:55,456
If they if you ever show you like a 1950s High School yearbook and you start look

1871
01:45:55,712 --> 01:45:56,480
Looking through it you're like

1872
01:45:56,992 --> 01:45:58,016
These people are 45

1873
01:45:58,272 --> 01:45:59,808
There's no way people look

1874
01:46:00,064 --> 01:46:06,208
This old at this age right or you watch Saved by the Bell

1875
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:10,304
That him

1876
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:13,632
The words I'm 29 coming out of that house

1877
01:46:13,888 --> 01:46:20,032
Absurd unacceptable

1878
01:46:20,288 --> 01:46:20,800
Started out he was

1879
01:46:21,056 --> 01:46:27,200
Young and no one ever was like look at this

1880
01:46:27,456 --> 01:46:30,784
Larry David looked old one

1881
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:31,552
Alex Azar

1882
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:39,232
45 this clips

1883
01:46:39,744 --> 01:46:40,512
Always

1884
01:46:40,768 --> 01:46:42,560
I think a big part of it is that you like

1885
01:46:43,072 --> 01:46:44,096
He sounds

1886
01:46:44,352 --> 01:46:44,864
Weary

1887
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:45,632
A little bit

1888
01:46:45,888 --> 01:46:49,472
These things that are so

1889
01:46:49,728 --> 01:46:52,288
Antiquated that you guys got to be a grandpa

1890
01:46:52,544 --> 01:46:55,616
And he's he is doing a Limbaugh voice

1891
01:46:55,872 --> 01:46:59,200
He's still doing a Limbaugh voice at this time so he's 29 and he

1892
01:46:59,456 --> 01:47:03,296
Actively trying to sound older

1893
01:47:03,552 --> 01:47:07,392
Or is that Alex is aware of the Liberty Lobby and that he's into them

1894
01:47:07,904 --> 01:47:14,048
That's because Neo-Nazi and white nationalist Willis carto started the Liberty lobby as an effort to sway public opinion against Jews

1895
01:47:15,072 --> 01:47:17,376
This is an actual quote from a letter that car do route

1896
01:47:17,888 --> 01:47:20,192
Hitler's defeat was the defeat of Europe

1897
01:47:20,448 --> 01:47:21,216
Band of America

1898
01:47:21,472 --> 01:47:22,752
How could we have been so blind

1899
01:47:23,008 --> 01:47:23,776
And the blame it's me

1900
01:47:24,032 --> 01:47:26,336
Must be laid at the door of the international Jews

1901
01:47:26,848 --> 01:47:31,200
It was their propaganda lies and demands which blind at the Westwood Germany was doing

1902
01:47:31,712 --> 01:47:37,856
If Satan himself with all of his superhuman diabolical Ingenuity at his command

1903
01:47:38,112 --> 01:47:40,928
Permanent disintegration enforced for the destruction of the nation

1904
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:43,744
He could have done no better than to invent the Jews

1905
01:47:44,256 --> 01:47:47,072
I could not believe that Paul Joseph Watson

1906
01:47:47,584 --> 01:47:53,728
Political activism included starting the youth for Wallace organization to support the present

1907
01:47:53,984 --> 01:47:55,776
Central route of segregation is George Wallace

1908
01:47:56,288 --> 01:48:02,432
His group eventually became the National Youth Alliance which would end up splintering at the different organizations one of which being the national

1909
01:48:02,688 --> 01:48:07,808
Led by William Luther Pierce who is a straight-up Neo-Nazi in the author of the Turner Diaries

1910
01:48:08,064 --> 01:48:11,392
Which is considered more or less the essential text of the modern militia whites

1911
01:48:11,648 --> 01:48:12,416
Supremacist community

1912
01:48:12,928 --> 01:48:16,512
Pierce's Mentor while in the National Youth Alliance coincidentally was the fashion

1913
01:48:16,768 --> 01:48:18,560
Founding member of the John Birch Society

1914
01:48:18,816 --> 01:48:19,840
Reveal Opie Oliver

1915
01:48:20,608 --> 01:48:25,472
So this is all fun but this is the intellectual tradition that Alex celebrate

1916
01:48:25,728 --> 01:48:26,240
And he come

1917
01:48:26,496 --> 01:48:29,312
Songs from klusterfuk of white supremacists and Nazis

1918
01:48:29,568 --> 01:48:32,896
The group name desperate to mask their true character with the appearance

1919
01:48:33,152 --> 01:48:33,920
The Patriots

1920
01:48:34,432 --> 01:48:35,456
It's important to remember that

1921
01:48:35,712 --> 01:48:36,480
Sometimes when

1922
01:48:36,736 --> 01:48:39,552
There's some goofy dumb bulshit that Alex is coming into an

1923
01:48:39,808 --> 01:48:45,184
When we have in the present-day these reminders that people like Paul's use employees

1924
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:46,720
Harbor the same sorts

1925
01:48:46,976 --> 01:48:49,280
The feelings and express them sometimes in moments of

1926
01:48:49,792 --> 01:48:50,304
Looseness

1927
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:54,912
Call me it's it makes total sense because the people wear all of their information comes

1928
01:48:55,168 --> 01:48:56,448
From the people who are

1929
01:48:56,704 --> 01:48:59,008
The forefathers of them in

1930
01:48:59,264 --> 01:48:59,776
This

1931
01:49:00,288 --> 01:49:02,080
I guess if you want to call it information

1932
01:49:02,592 --> 01:49:03,104
They were white

1933
01:49:03,360 --> 01:49:04,640
Supremacists and Nazis

1934
01:49:05,152 --> 01:49:05,664
Yep

1935
01:49:06,944 --> 01:49:07,712
No they are

1936
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:11,552
Welsummer

1937
01:49:12,064 --> 01:49:14,624
Deceased

1938
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:15,392
They were you

1939
01:49:16,672 --> 01:49:22,304
Get that bad taste out of your mouth

1940
01:49:22,816 --> 01:49:23,584
In perhaps the worst

1941
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:24,608
Possible way

1942
01:49:38,944 --> 01:49:39,456
Big picture

1943
01:49:39,968 --> 01:49:41,248
Already

1944
01:49:53,792 --> 01:49:54,304
You heard

1945
01:50:00,448 --> 01:50:00,960
No

1946
01:50:08,640 --> 01:50:09,408
It freaks them out

1947
01:50:09,664 --> 01:50:10,944
What a sales pitch wow

1948
01:50:11,200 --> 01:50:17,344
Can't wait to get that

1949
01:50:17,600 --> 01:50:19,648
Throw up

1950
01:50:19,904 --> 01:50:23,488
Or if I drive you mad

1951
01:50:24,256 --> 01:50:28,608
African laughing uncontrollably walking the streets

1952
01:50:31,936 --> 01:50:32,960
When you see this video

1953
01:50:33,216 --> 01:50:36,544
And if you do not show someone else 7 days you will die

1954
01:50:37,056 --> 01:50:42,432
911 road to tyranny of the original ring that the original ring

1955
01:50:46,528 --> 01:50:49,088
Said really tight Bhai pocket product

1956
01:50:49,344 --> 01:50:50,624
I got it I might be

1957
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:52,928
If you

1958
01:50:53,184 --> 01:50:54,720
Listen to knowledge fight you know

1959
01:50:54,976 --> 01:51:01,120
What happens to you when you listen to me you will s*** your pain will leave all of your bowels

1960
01:51:01,376 --> 01:51:05,216
Rollable diarrhea

1961
01:51:05,472 --> 01:51:10,080
It's good to put the pieces together

1962
01:51:10,336 --> 01:51:14,944
Hey I mean look spiritually speaking I think I've watched some of Alex's film so they do make me

1963
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:16,992
Are these true

1964
01:51:17,248 --> 01:51:18,528
Literally speaking

1965
01:51:19,296 --> 01:51:19,808
Seems a little

1966
01:51:20,064 --> 01:51:24,672
He's a little silly really I did find myself laughing a lot

1967
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:31,584
True because you took us nine hours straight

1968
01:51:32,096 --> 01:51:36,448
So we come to the end of this 2003 adventure and I think it was a

1969
01:51:36,704 --> 01:51:39,008
A little bit of a reprieve from tantastic

1970
01:51:39,264 --> 01:51:44,640
But you still see shades of stuff there then I'll with a branding of this lgbtq

1971
01:51:44,896 --> 01:51:46,176
Did you friendly School in New York

1972
01:51:46,432 --> 01:51:48,224
Something adjacent to pedophilia

1973
01:51:48,480 --> 01:51:52,576
I'm see that like being echoed in the present-day you see

1974
01:51:52,832 --> 01:51:56,160
Alex being really down with a outlet run by Nazis

1975
01:51:59,744 --> 01:52:02,304
Yeah there are these These are reverberations of

1976
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:03,840
Very similar things

1977
01:52:04,096 --> 01:52:05,120
Present day

1978
01:52:05,632 --> 01:52:06,912
The bomber

1979
01:52:07,424 --> 01:52:07,936
Well

1980
01:52:09,216 --> 01:52:11,776
I mean when you when you think of it in terms of like

1981
01:52:12,032 --> 01:52:12,544
These are

1982
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:14,080
Gigantic reactions

1983
01:52:14,336 --> 01:52:15,360
Two things like what word

1984
01:52:15,616 --> 01:52:16,640
Experiencing right now

1985
01:52:16,896 --> 01:52:18,688
Is the culmination of the

1986
01:52:18,944 --> 01:52:19,712
Organic reaction

1987
01:52:19,968 --> 01:52:20,480
Into

1988
01:52:20,736 --> 01:52:22,528
Abortion in 1970

1989
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:23,808
You know like this

1990
01:52:24,064 --> 01:52:24,832
This is all

1991
01:52:25,088 --> 01:52:26,368
A momentous

1992
01:52:26,624 --> 01:52:27,392
It's just Jake

1993
01:52:28,160 --> 01:52:28,672
Huge wave

1994
01:52:29,440 --> 01:52:33,024
And you can't just stand in front of it not one person can you like get in the way

1995
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:36,352
Ethel we're going to see what happens whenever the wave goes the other direction

1996
01:52:36,864 --> 01:52:38,912
Like what they are doing to us

1997
01:52:39,424 --> 01:52:40,448
He's going to have

1998
01:52:40,960 --> 01:52:41,984
Massive

1999
01:52:42,752 --> 01:52:44,288
Active results

2000
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:46,592
That are going to take time you know

2001
01:52:46,848 --> 01:52:47,872
You don't know what they're going to be

2002
01:52:49,152 --> 01:52:50,176
Some

2003
01:52:50,688 --> 01:52:51,200
Sure

2004
01:52:52,480 --> 01:52:53,504
Big

2005
01:52:54,016 --> 01:52:59,392

2009
01:53:17,056 --> 01:53:17,568
Well

2010
01:53:17,824 --> 01:53:19,104
That would be the

2011
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:20,384
Status quo

2012
01:53:20,640 --> 01:53:26,784
So I will be back Jordan but until then we've website

2013
