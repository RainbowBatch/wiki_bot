00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:36,223
Brian stelter and Michael Wolff

69
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:39,551
Talk about it being a literal demon

70
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:43,903
And they will get back to that today cuz there's a little bit of a blowback

71
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:44,927
Alex

72
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:46,719

00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,095
I had stelter made a comment

75
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:54,655
Yeah he said thanks for using a good picture of me

76
00:04:55,935 --> 00:05:02,079
Solid solid he gets what's going on and isn't engaging with it

77
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,615
Any meaningful way

78
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:10,271
A little disappointed Jones beef around

79
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:14,367
Bars in each other that be amazing

80
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:19,231
I'll bet we could do that as we get to it but you know we have to take Alex as The Show Goes

81
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:25,887
So here we open up the show what's it the Beaverton Alex Jones is Bond at the beach

95
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:29,375
As a vehicle

96
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:33,471
They're called the good club

They're going to bring in a world government and a world Youth Corps

101
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,951
A world sterilization

102
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:02,399
Oprah Winfrey is a absolute anti-human

103
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:03,935
So

104
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:06,239
Do you want to try and guess what the truth behind that is

105
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,055
First off

106
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:18,527
What's her new movie coming out I don't know I don't care I don't care at all

107
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:23,135
Something interesting but I don't really I don't particularly keep up too much with movies

108
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,671
Understand

109
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,951
Correct

110
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:26,975
Oprah

111
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,511
Go on over yet

112
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:29,791
Front

113
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,839
For the women sterilization

114
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:35,167
And she is creating a

115
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:35,935
Church

116
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,471
Live One World Government source

117
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:41,311
Something along those lines

118
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,335
Said anything about

119
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,359
You whenever

120
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:48,991
I bet she has all right I'm done with

121
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,551
What is responding to is that she's been a part of like

122
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:53,087
Contraception

123
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:53,855
Effort

124
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:58,975
Around-the-world limiting the population but not in

125
00:07:59,231 --> 00:07:59,999
In terms of killing

126
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,535
People more in terms of

127
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,583
Being able to control your own life

128
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,167
The stuff that like

129
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:13,567
It's you talked about would like Ted Turner's evil like

130
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:19,967
He's crazy population

131
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:22,015
Stop you're really going to look at it actual quotes

132
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,039
What are you talkin about

133
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:26,111
It would be good for the population

134
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:29,695
And to be lower than it is especially in resource deprived environment

135
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:31,743
Advocate for

136
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:32,511
Killing

137
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,583
Say it in a very fun

138
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,167
Misinterpreted

139
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,239
Everything weird old man who owns the Atlanta Braves

140
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:46,079
The quote into a buffalo

141
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:48,127
And then had

142
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:51,199
Sting the wrestler Sting a come out with a 30

143
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,735
WCW for a bit

00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,295
Right

145
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:59,391
Oh yeah

146
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:02,719
Melinda Gates

147
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,487
Organization

148
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:07,583
The Super Evil mixed with them trying to kill off the third world

149
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:12,191
Really mess with his Narrative of the globalist that he's

150
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:15,519
Do we listen to the other day or something about them the triple cross

151
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:18,591
Narrative

152
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,615
The straight-up be targeting

153
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:20,383
Third world

154
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,431
I don't really understand

155
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:27,295
It's hard to don't think there's any negative thing about Oprah that I would like

156
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:31,903
Whatever it is you want to say about Oprah anybody's ever been like

157
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:38,303
Yeah I don't know I don't know if that's true

158
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,863
I thought her magazine sucked

159
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:45,471
She's ever been on The View at least like there's a lot of like I don't know what to

160
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,007
Now there's a

161
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,031
A video versus

162
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:51,615
Screaming at Piers Morgan

163
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,895
Is she still married

164
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:54,175
That one

165
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,455
Or did he die

166
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:57,759
Is she married

167
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,295
Is Gaelic

168
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:03,391
I don't know until

169
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:07,231
I don't care about her personal life by Frank

170
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:07,999
It's not my business

171
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:12,607
A very important thing in her to become

172
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,375
Right now so I've

173
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,007
Thanks but she

174
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,799
She's legitimately running for president

175
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,847
Thanks that everyone is like

176
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:27,455
And it's the same thing that people do a lot like this with The Rock

177
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,991
And to be fair with The Rock

178
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:29,759
F******

179
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:32,063
He said into it a lot more

180
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:34,111
Then than Oprah is

181
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:36,159
I think it was it wasn't it Meryl Streep

182
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:36,927
Last Knights

183
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:43,327
She's just drafted herself to run for president about the Golden Globes

184
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,119
News about Oprah and they were like

185
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,935
Has like a you guys are

186
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:52,031
Guys are sick of calling Trump a monster so you're just like

187
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:54,335
Baby Oprah I got nothing else to write about

188
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:58,431
About today right I don't have a negative opinion of Oprah

189
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:03,039
I don't dislike her at all but I I don't think

190
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,831
That she is some sort of

191
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:05,599
Evil

192
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:07,903
I think she's evil in as much as

193
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,695
Make a lot of money

194
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:15,583
Morally questionable decision

195
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,375
She also does seem to give back a lot cheese

196
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:19,423
Be very

197
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,471
Pull a positive message

198
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:23,775
Call me when she's done

199
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,311
Time for insider trading

200
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:28,639
Yeah anyway Alex Jones.

201
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:29,919
But she's running for office

202
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,199
Everything's if there's something

203
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,223
Nefarious behind it

204
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:35,039
Aforementioned the Bill and Melinda Gates

205
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,575
Gotcha

206
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:38,879
God

207
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:45,279
Disagree

208
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:48,095
Tells us

209
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,423
Stan's for women

210
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:55,775
Globalist tool bag of Bill and Melinda Gates

211
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:59,103
Oh by the way

212
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:07,039
Will clear messages.

213
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:11,391
A lot of people are going to die

214
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,719
Absolutely

215
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:18,047
I didn't shut up

216
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:23,935
Okay

217
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:28,799
That's not

218
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:29,823
Now

219
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,103
Now I just have a

220
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:33,151
An image of an army of Oprah

221
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:37,247
Ofra

222
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:40,063
Oprah Winfrey

223
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:46,463
So I think about Melinda Gates she was talking about if people don't

224
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:52,863
Stop lying about vaccines regarding

225
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:53,631
Speaking to him

226
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,167
Through a television set

227
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:57,727
Britches

228
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:02,591
Shut up about them

229
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,407
He never shuts up

230
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:10,015
Maybe what he should have said it when he said I could I can't shut up about that

231
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:13,343
You should have qualified with that

232
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,879
Qualified that with

233
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,415
No seriously

234
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:18,975
I can't somebody please help me I need

235
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:24,863
This is a cry for help I need to shut up. Or something

236
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:29,471
Them hot garbage and in the next half-hour Jones

237
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,263
Advice for The Rock

238
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:34,847
Alright

239
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:37,663
If we see a rock Oprah primary

240
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:38,687
I'm going to be

241
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,455
Very happy

242
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:41,759
And also

243
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,335
Obscure

244
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:16,831
Hollywood

245
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:24,511
The number one movie this weekend

246
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,047
Hollywood

247
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:30,399
Difference

248
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,423
Between the Rock

249
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:35,519
Hold on 40 is a Republican

250
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,055
The hold on

251
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:46,783
Replace some of it when we come back it's just been lectured when you know

252
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:50,623
That this woman is a Monster by Rihanna. Right There

253
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:01,631
Right

254
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:07,775
Always have fun with that

255
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:12,639
Know that The Rock was a Republican

256
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:17,247
He spoke at the Republican convention in 2000

257
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:19,295
Ladies and gentlemen

258
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:37,983
I miss is why we got g w

259
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:44,383
You coming out

260
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:49,759
Oh yeah

261
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:53,599
Drop the people's elbow on Dennis hastert

262
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:02,047
To speak at the Republican

263
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,567
It's kind of a headache

264
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:18,687
Speech for the Rocco

265
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:20,223
18 years ago

266
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,295
Big smooth charismatic man that is now

267
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:29,439
Some of the catchphrases

268
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:31,487
Of course I've been turned into Dwayne

269
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:38,143
Buc-ee's

270
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,983
I need to get in touch with the

271
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:45,567
And then he's like I got two words for you

272
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,103
Does the eyebrow

273
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:52,991
I don't like

274
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:56,319
Absolutely

275
00:16:56,575 --> 00:17:02,719
Frustrated

276
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:05,023
That what we know about I'm not given the fact

277
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:09,631
Linda McMahon is in the Trump Administration

278
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:15,007
Iraq

279
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,543
This once again proves

280
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:19,871
50 world of politics has turned into professional wrestling

281
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:24,223
Because the rock is going to turn heel on America

282
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:28,319
Completely support this tax bill that's what's going to happen you know what else

283
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:29,855
Cruise Alex

284
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:31,391
This whole notion about like

285
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:34,719
You can't be a conservative in Hollywood The Blacklist

286
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,999
Cuz the Rock

287
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,815
At the 2000 convention

288
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,607
And is the biggest

289
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:43,679
Star in Hollywood

290
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,775
When he spoke at that convention

291
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:53,407
Wasn't the biggest Hollywood Hollywood

292
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:55,199
It's his whole career

293
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:58,015
After himself as a Republican

294
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,367
Did anybody know that

295
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:06,975
Yeah I think I think people knew that

296
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:09,279
I just didn't know that

297
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,327
Nobody knew he was serious

298
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,959
Who'd have guessed that he's a Republican

299
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,007
We are doing economically

300
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:24,895
I respect that he was a corporate for a while that's absolutely some indication

301
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:27,967
What's too bad

302
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:28,991
What's up

303
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:31,807
He said they never heard that before

304
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:36,159
This is very important

305
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:39,999
The Rock

306
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:42,559
Thank you so in the next

307
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,607
Number of clip

308
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,167
We get into Alex trying to

309
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,191
To deconstruct

310
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:49,471
Oprah Oprah speech

311
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:50,751
From the Golden Globes

312
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:51,519
Okay

313
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:56,639
It sucks

314
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:59,967
I have studiously avoided any Golden Globes.

315
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:00,735
I have

316
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,271
One opinion on that

317
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:04,319
They were doing something

318
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,599
Banggood

319
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:12,511
I don't have no I have nothing to say I don't care about award shows make

320
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,791
The victim

321
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:17,119
Visible is great

322
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:25,055
And found nothing in it

323
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,591
Troubling

324
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:28,895
Alex on the other hand

325
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:33,247
Are you doing Belinda Casey she was going to get you

326
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:38,367
In this first clip Alex

327
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:41,695
That's exactly how that I'm assuming that's

328
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:45,535
The camps that they're going to send all of these

329
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:49,887
Conservatives to our it's just Oprah yelling at them and then the rock giving them the people's elbow

330
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:52,703
A clip

331
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:53,983
Seemed really have much of a

332
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:54,751
Concern

333
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:55,775
Other than

334
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,055
He just doesn't like

335
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:09,087
What are the number one anime in the world

336
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:15,487
Grand Admiral Street

337
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:16,767
The problem

338
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:19,327
Media so wonderful Trump so evil

339
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:22,655
Here is her chicken garbage on the listing

340
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:25,983
Filth

341
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:29,055
The Hollywood Foreign Press Association

342
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:32,639
Because we all know

343
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:37,247
But we also know the insatiable dedication

344
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:40,831
What kind of book

345
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:47,231
Absolute absolute

346
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,583
Say speaking about older

347
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:54,911
Horse Show Coronavirus

348
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:06,175
Thus far it just seems like a fine

349
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:12,319
Seems more like a regular Alex Jones trying to play clip where the moment she's about to say something to eat

350
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,087
Disagrees with

351
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:14,111
He cuts her off in

352
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:16,159
She's ugly Brian

353
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:19,232
And everyone else is old and ugly

354
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:22,048
Did they hang out with the demons

355
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:24,352
The songs in the thing

356
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:31,008
They always comes down on Meryl Streep for like not attacking Roman Polanski

357
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:32,544
Meryl Streep

358
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:36,640
Find legitimate complaint to have about somebody expose

359
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:38,432
It also attacked

360
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,712
Justin Timberlake

361
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:48,160
Buck Woody Allen Roman Polanski

362
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:51,488
Doesn't seem to do that much

363
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:58,656
Boxing match different flag

364
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:03,008
So let's see how long it takes him to interrupt cavities

365
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,568
He's restarting it of course

366
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,848
Donut from the top

367
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,640
Oh okay

368
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:13,248
But keeps us from turning a blind eye to corruption

369
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:23,744
God the media sure to keep us

370
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,536
From the corruption

371
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:29,376
God

372
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:31,680
Thank God

373
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:43,200
So that I'd like to make as the globalist aren't real and the things that he's complaining about the Clinton

374
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:46,784
Aren't real either things like the uranium one s*** furthermore

375
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,368
With broken by the mainstream media

376
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,672
Even further

377
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:54,208
Isn't he

378
00:22:55,232 --> 00:23:01,376
Media who says he's fighting against corruption and he's the only voice like mother is that

379
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,448
He's not lying

380
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:06,752
Okay

381
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:13,152
I don't know it's stupid either aren't real or are mainly unrelated

382
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:14,176
Oprah

383
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:14,944
Right

384
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:22,112
22 Tyrus and victims

385
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:24,672
I secret and lies

386
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:28,000
I want to change

387
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:31,584
As we try to

388
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,216
Which brings me to this

389
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:39,520
Sure

390
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:43,616
Is that speaking your truth

391
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,712
Speak your truth

392
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:52,832
Your Magic Kingdom

393
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:57,696
R-Truth

394
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:05,120
What are the family

395
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:06,656
It was weird when she said

396
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:08,448
Trying to kill Pro

397
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:12,288
By the way no look

398
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:14,336
We need to support women

399
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:15,360
You need to speak

400
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:19,456
The truth that you know because you have been abused and you have been

401
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:24,064
Absolutely

402
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,952
I mean you see this is a business

403
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:32,768
Is entirely all he does

404
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,584
Second episode it's like

405
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:37,632
Some of this is kind of boring

406
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:46,592
He only heard the words tell your truth right speak your truth any justice

407
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:52,992
Cermak

408
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,552
To some extent

409
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,320
Myfairpoint

410
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:59,136
We all have

411
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:04,000
And inspired by all the women

412
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:11,168
I didn't know about the Islam assistant

413
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:15,008
A 1000 men women and children

414
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:21,152
And the News getting a minion

415
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:27,040
Are We There Yet the word about Thursday

416
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:30,880
The world

417
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:42,400
Is it look good today

418
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:47,264
I think he's in libel territory here I believe

419
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,336
What are you talkin about

420
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,456
Actress says

421
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,552
Harvey Weinstein use Oprah and Naomi

422
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:00,576
Seduce me

423
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,136
I mean that's

424
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,232
I guess if he can pull that off

425
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:11,584
It's a good headline if you don't read the article

426
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:17,984
Aspiring actresses Harvey Weinstein use Oprah Winfrey and Naomi Campbell to dupe her into thinking he would help her

427
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:18,752
With her career

428
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:20,288
Only if you use her for sex

429
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:24,384
Calling Oprah and say okay

430
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,992
British actress comedian Noble head over heels in France

431
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:30,016
But you first met wife

432
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,296
Set an event London

433
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:35,392
Could you hanging out with model Naomi Campbell and it Megastar Oprah swinging off his arm

434
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:38,720
I thought something amazing in store for me

435
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:39,744
She said during a

436
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,024
Siri I press conference in

437
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,304
The Manhattan to discuss

438
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,328
Strapping lawsuit

439
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:45,120
She filed a day earlier against wine

440
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:46,656
Federal courts

441
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:51,008
I don't think you're responsible headlight

442
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:52,288
I think

443
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:55,616
Cobras association with

444
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:58,176
Looked at

445
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:02,528
Implies a level of agent

446
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:06,368
Very irresponsible headline is

447
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:07,648
Wrong

448
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:09,440
Come down immediately

449
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:15,840
Be fair if the headline is stated in as much as it is like an assertion that this lady

450
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:16,608
He is making

451
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:21,472
What's her words don't actually save that Alex is misrepresenting at 8

452
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:22,240
Second

453
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:25,824
And saying that she actually was like

454
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,104
Recruiting women

455
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,640
For him and stuff like that

456
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:32,480
Is a legitimate reading of

457
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,320
That's my that's my

458
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:38,368
Mine is clearly meant

459
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,136
Tubi

460
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:41,184
Ambiguous enough for you to go

461
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:47,584
Wait what the f*** and then click on it and then read the the rest of the article very very responsible

462
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:53,728
Alex has fallen First 48

463
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:54,496
To trace back

464
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:55,264
To a tweet

465
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:59,616
She put out that says is it just me or is Trump praising to Ronnie and protesters

466
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:02,688
At the same time also Banning Iranians

467
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:03,712
From entering the USA

468
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,760
And there's two

469
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:06,528
Emoticon

470
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:07,808
2

471
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:09,600
Scratching the emoticon

472
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:11,904
She might have said some other stuff but I don't think so

473
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,720
She's impunity protesters that that's what I can find

474
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:17,024
The backlash

475
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,584
The alt-right world is having online

476
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,144
And I don't think that's very extreme

477
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:23,168
Point to make

478
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:25,472
Not bad but be that as it may

479
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,544
Every Everything Is Not

480
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:31,360
Everything is fake

481
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:32,896
Furthermore everything

482
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:36,736
Is a facade

483
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:40,576
Right

484
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:41,344
Forget about

485
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,416
Tomorrow I promise you will get eventually.

486
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:50,816
Furious and everyone in the room

487
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:52,608
He's gonna scream

488
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:53,888
Listen to this being like

489
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:56,960
I don't

490
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:58,496
I don't care I don't care

491
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:02,592
Like you have to say something

492
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:03,616
It's a daily thing

493
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:05,664
And I respect that you got hit

494
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:08,992
F*** off

495
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,296
Don't make me try and have a take on the

496
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:15,392
To be a news person

497
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:17,696
And then report that Oprah is

498
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:18,976
Procuring women

499
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:20,256
For Harvey Weinstein

500
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:27,168
By association with her this woman was tricked into thinking

501
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:28,704
He would help her career

502
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,728
That is

503
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:36,384
I mean I don't I don't know I don't know what libel and slander like what constitutes especially when you're a public figure

504
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:41,760
You got to make a really pretty serious case

505
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:42,784
What Alex does

506
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:44,576
He should be deeply ashamed of

507
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:45,856
In terms of

508
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:47,648
Even for him

509
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:48,672
Like you should

510
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:49,696
Keisha probably about

511
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,000
He should probably put out a track

512
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:00,704
Disassociate

513
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:04,032
The other thing though is that like this really invalidate

514
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:06,080
How much he actually knows about his

515
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:07,360
Flagship issue

516
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:10,176
Which seems to be his take on pedophiles and sex drive

517
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,248
So he thinks that Oprah it is

518
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:16,320
Proven to be mixed up with this because of this headline

519
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:17,088
Adeline

520
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,368
I got bad news

521
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:19,136
You do nothing

522
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:20,672
You're making it all up

523
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,208
Which we already knew

524
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:23,232
Anyway

525
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:26,560
Oprah speech

526
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:31,680
His lies per minute right now

527
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:33,728
Staggering

528
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:37,824
Speak up

529
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,360
Ensure their personal stories

530
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:42,944
Each of us in this room

531
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,248
Celebrated

532
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:47,296
Stories that we tell

533
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,512
Alex doesn't seem to understand

534
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:58,304
Mediums like Filmer

535
00:30:59,072 --> 00:30:59,584
Storyteller

536
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:02,656
She's talking about

537
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:03,936
This room we're celebrating

538
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:04,704
The stories we've

539
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:06,496
Film

540
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,920
Hate about what Alec

541
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:14,688
Alex Jones is turn

542
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:17,248
There's a massive difference

543
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,272
Between

544
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:19,808
Feeling guilty

545
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:21,600
Can people feel guilt

546
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:23,648
And pointing out people

547
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:24,672
Guilt right

548
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:27,744
You know it's not it's not that she's trying to make

549
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,512
Make men

550
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:30,048
Feel guilty is that

551
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:32,096
These men are guilty of crime

552
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:37,728
You shouldn't feel guilty about what all men do

553
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:39,776
You should point out that

554
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:41,568
Most men are guilty of crimes

555
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:47,456
We became the story

556
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:54,368
But it's not just a story

557
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:58,464
Thank you for telling us the story

558
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:03,584
And that's just his way of trying to deflect

559
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:10,240
Trying to pretend that that's all Trump did was ask anymore

560
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,264
Trying to weave

561
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:13,568
Using a word with Peach

562
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:16,128
As a hinge again just trying

563
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:17,664
Flip something to defend Trump

564
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:20,480
You cut it

565
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:22,016
Cut it up

566
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:25,856
He's doing going by one random password

567
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:26,880
In every sentence

568
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:27,648
You come

569
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,184
Completely inoculate your

570
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,744
From understanding the entirety

571
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:38,400
You can't understand the point at all whenever he's actually afraid of the content of something but feels

572
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:40,704
She has to cover it usually does it in this way

573
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,984
Whenever it's

574
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:47,616
Chop chop you can hate without ever actually engaged

575
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:53,504
You're engaging with random as words you're not engaging with

576
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:59,904
Teaches you really really bad and poorly thought-out things you can say to you

577
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:06,048
Your friends on Facebook who posted the speed create all sorts of that

578
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,864
I love I love NE

579
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:10,400
Postville Oprah

580
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:14,240
Sarsour

581
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:17,568
Entertainment industry

582
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:21,152
It's 1

583
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:22,432
Geography

584
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:23,200
Race

585
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:24,224
Religion

586
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,808
Because you're trying to destroy all that

587
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:28,832
Okay

588
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:34,976
I don't think that's what that there's tons of Japanese

589
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:35,744
For instance

590
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,816
Chinese movies

591
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:40,864
One world

592
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:44,960
Movies for mother other cultures that

593
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:47,520
How are emotionally moving and still resonate

594
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:49,056
Deeply into something that's

595
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:53,920
Can bring people together in a meaningful way

596
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,712
It's not that you wanted

597
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:57,248
Destroy cultures

598
00:33:57,504 --> 00:34:00,064
And make them into a monoculture

599
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:01,344
I know you do

600
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:02,368
Go ahead

601
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:05,440
No I got nothing I just want to talk about it

602
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:12,096
I'm sure it's Grill Washington

603
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,632
Politics

604
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:14,656
For workplace

605
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:23,872
An assault

606
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:26,432
Because little

607
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:31,808
Had children just see the building

608
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:34,112
Hollywood

609
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:36,416
Hollywood abused woman

610
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:39,744
Hollywood pedophile

611
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,768
The abused one

612
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:42,560
It's a good one

613
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:45,120
We're. Poisonous we're good

614
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:49,728
Also I hope the Roxbury

615
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:52,288
I mean look that is a lot of problem

616
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:53,312
Hollywood in terms of

617
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:58,432
Systematic power imbalances and people who exploit those power imbalances

618
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:00,992
Power Balance right right but

619
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:02,528
Hollywood

620
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,832
Right and it's glamorized

621
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:08,928
We've had years and years of

622
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:14,560
Any office building where there's that kind of power imbalance in group

623
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:18,656
Alex Jones is really pissed off about

624
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:23,008
Here though is that Oprah

625
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:23,776
But she's trying to

626
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:24,544
Claim of Vick's

627
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,312
Status

628
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:29,920
Which employee can handle that he can't handle that because that's

629
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,504
That's what I do about white

630
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,296
Don't you understand

631
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:41,184
You can't we just put in on my territory we can't be in the same space

632
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:42,464
With this

633
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:43,744
Because

634
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:45,024
You're Oprah

635
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,560
And I'm just Alex Jones

636
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:49,120
If you if you occupy Myspace

637
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:49,888
Dude

638
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:50,912
I got no shot

639
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:53,472
I just

640
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,008
It's mutually

641
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:57,824
It's not mutually exclusive

642
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:02,944
I have a legitimate claim to some sort of victim standard

643
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:04,480
And I himself

644
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:07,296
So it it's just it's a load of hot bulshit

645
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:09,856
This is one of those things

646
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:12,160
It's sort of a little bit like why

647
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:13,184
I

648
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,232
A book about people whose like

649
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:21,632
It's little things like that that are like okay you got to

650
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,680
Remember those the white victimhood behind.

651
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:25,984
Everything how dangerous that mentality is

652
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:30,592
12 a.m. for like that Brian

653
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:34,688
You got to understand what's behind it and how this is not an isolated incident

654
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:35,712
It's par for the course

655
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:37,248
But

656
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:38,528
I mean what what he

657
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:39,808
He's really trying to do

658
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,600
His turn

659
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:43,136
Any kind of alike

660
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:45,184
Women being victimized

661
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:46,976
Has victimized

662
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:49,024
Like anybody else

663
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,096
Who are who is legitimately

664
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:54,144
Who is legitimately attacked who

665
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,168
Legitimately

666
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,008
Discriminated against

667
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,800
Mentioning.

668
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:02,336
You make me a victim

669
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:04,640
Mentioning

670
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:06,432
Nickelback

671
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:13,088
I don't want to feel guilty I don't want to make me feel

672
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:13,856
Alright

673
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:18,208
Good luck living in a civilization then when you do Patty

674
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:20,000
Hugo's on

675
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:22,816
And dreams to pursue

676
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:29,728
Are there such good people look at them all

677
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:30,752
Paw Patrol

678
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:32,288
Are the women

679
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:45,856
Slave factories or not

680
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:55,328
The Evil globalist operation telling you I will

681
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:56,864
Chicken

682
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:58,144
So I mean

683
00:37:58,656 --> 00:37:59,424
She's

684
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,192
Oprah

685
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,472
Come far in the world

686
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:02,752
Haha

687
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:03,776
She started out

688
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:04,544
As nothing

689
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,640
And got all the way to the center of the globalist operation

690
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:12,224
Even if even if globalist

691
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,016
Were real

692
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:17,088
Rags2riches

693
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:23,744
I don't I don't like those like I mean we could you just play any kind of game like that though like a you don't talk about

694
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,096
Everybody has trouble

695
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:29,888
What are you making

696
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:35,776
General examples of women and even though the ones that I don't include are not mention

697
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:38,336
They are included by

698
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:40,896
Association

699
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:44,992
You're right I did not specifically mention

700
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:50,368
Any member of the ways that women have been victimized maybe that's an issue Alex

701
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:52,672
You should count you should f******

702
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:53,952
Hey Jordan

703
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:55,488
Next eclipse

704
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:59,840
The wild

705
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:04,960
This this next clip is the conclusion of his coverage of that

706
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:05,728
Of the

707
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:12,384
His hero's journey that's not literally true cuz he does get back to it later

708
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,688
To stop covering it by a commercial break

709
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:15,712
And

710
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:20,576
He says some really weird stuff

711
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:28,768
Working in factories today working restaurants in there and Academia Engineering in medicine and science

712
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:31,328
Text

713
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:39,008
This filthy

714
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:49,504
Real quick

715
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,808
Before we get to the really weird stuff

716
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:54,368
You think that she would shuttle young women in

717
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,672
That's not what that article says that all

718
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:58,464
That is absolutely not what it says

719
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:03,328
Like what

720
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:08,448
Picture of kissing

721
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:09,216
His ear

722
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:10,240
Harvey Weinstein

723
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:12,800
You could find compromising pictures of

724
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:14,592
Just about every celebrity because of

725
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:17,408
You know how big of a mogul

726
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:18,432
Exactly

727
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:24,576
Just reported

728
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:34,816
You are quite the parking

729
00:40:55,040 --> 00:41:01,184
So you got cut off by the break their eyes

730
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:07,328
I don't like that you have some Humanity in you cuz you like men

731
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:09,632
Whatever

732
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:13,728
The implication there and you have to make the application because it's

733
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:15,008
Where how his mind works

734
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:18,848
You don't have Humanity on you if you are attracted to the same sex

735
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:20,128
That's not good

736
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:21,152
If you're attractive

737
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:21,920
Ted 2

738
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:22,688
The women

739
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:23,712
Wow

740
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:26,272
I think he's actually reversed asking

741
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,296
Insofar as

742
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:29,088
Anybody who is not attractive

743
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:33,696
Native attraction to Matt

744
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:34,720
I am gay

745
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:39,584
If you want

746
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:43,424
To misrepresent his words the way he missed represent

747
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:45,728
Victorville

748
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:47,520
Or the way he misrepresents

749
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:49,056
Melinda Gates

750
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:51,104
You could say Alex Jones

751
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:56,479
Just came out here on knowledge fight Alex Jones revealed

752
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:58,783
You gay or

753
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:06,207
That's entirely possible the UFO disclosure

754
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:09,279
To admit that he's an alien

755
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:13,887
Commercial break

756
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:15,679
I don't know the lines

757
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:16,959
Slander and libel.

758
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:17,727
He seems like he's

759
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:21,567
Very close to it

760
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:23,359
I think there might be a

761
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:24,895
Might be

762
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:26,431
Hopsewee goes to break

763
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:27,711
And he comes back and he's like

764
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:28,735
S***

765
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:30,271
I got nothing but time

766
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:35,903
I got to cover this Oprah stuff some more

767
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:39,487
Sort of

768
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:40,767
Heteronormative

769
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:42,559
Chauvinistic

770
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:45,119
He now decides it's time for me to get race

771
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:46,655
That's not good

772
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:47,935
So

773
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:50,239
Is Oprah rich

774
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:51,519
2

775
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:52,543
Kill Alex G

776
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:56,639
What destroys Empire

777
00:42:57,151 --> 00:43:00,223
For now I feel like if you're rich enough you get like one or two

778
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:03,807
I think it would I think it would be dangerous

779
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:05,087
I think it'd be too dangerous

780
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:06,111
To in terms of

781
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:07,391
First of all is wrong

782
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:13,023
Second grade

783
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:15,071
A blowback from listeners of his

784
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:15,839
Stuff like that

785
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:16,863
Tremendous

786
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:19,167
Problematic

787
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:20,703
Anyway you get back to Oprah

788
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:21,727
And like I said

789
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:23,263
Lower

790
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:33,759
At the Golden Globes

791
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:42,719
Oprah Winfrey

792
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:44,511
Ricci

793
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:45,535
Taylor

794
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:51,935
A name I know and I

795
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:53,727
Ricci Taylor was a young boy

796
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:55,007
Add a mother

797
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:58,079
She's just walking home from the church service

798
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:00,639
She's attended

799
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:03,199
When she was abducted by 6

800
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:05,759
Armed white man raped

801
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:12,671
Yeah definitely

802
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:32,895
Insulted by the side of the road

803
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:35,199
Coming home from church

804
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:47,231
Peacock but you're not even a black racist lady

805
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:49,791
This is your controller

806
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:56,191
You are a Nazi you are part of a group

807
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:01,823
You didn't you just made weird references to articles you're misrepresenting

808
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:05,151
Took the reason that you brought up Taylor's cuz she died like a week

809
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:09,247
She was at 7 years old

810
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:12,831
Yeah and I was 44

811
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:14,623
Tim g********* by 6 white men

812
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:15,903
Despite

813
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:20,255
Confessions to authorities subsequently denied to indict the man

814
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:22,559
No charges were ever brought against

815
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:25,631
I don't want to get into the details

816
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:28,447
Cuz it's f****** horrifying

817
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:29,727
A racially-based

818
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:33,311
Miscarriage of Justice

819
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:35,103
And the reason that you brought her up is

820
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:35,871
Because

821
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:37,663
She died a week ago

822
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:39,199
There's some

823
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:41,759
An older there is some positive things you can

824
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:43,039
Can take away in terms of

825
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:45,855
Indeed Alabama House of Representatives

826
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:48,671
In 2001 officially apologize to her on behalf of

827
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:49,439
The state

828
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:51,743
So there is there are some things that make

829
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:52,767
You know

830
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:56,863
Bright spots in the ER not murdered

831
00:45:58,399 --> 00:45:58,911
Because

832
00:45:59,423 --> 00:45:59,935
You haven't come

833
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:03,007
Bright white people totally have everything

834
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:06,335
I look on f****** real

835
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:07,103
I looked

836
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:11,711
Who sings a little bit cuz I want to follow along with

837
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:12,735
F****** point

838
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:16,063
Who is

839
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:18,623
I don't give a fuk

840
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:20,415
Like the race is a f******

841
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:21,439
Horrifying

842
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:25,535
Women are abducted

843
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:27,583
F****** deal with the

844
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:33,983
That's a big piece of it

845
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:36,031
That's pretty terrible

846
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:38,591
It's pretty pretty bad but

847
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:44,991
I wanted to check out this idea that white men are being killed by black people everyday and the media is

848
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:46,015
And Publishing at

849
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:48,319
The girl murders

850
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:50,367
Victims

851
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:51,391
In the last

852
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:52,671
Like couple days

853
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:54,207
You know in the New Year here

854
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:56,511
Kansas City North Main accused

855
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:58,559
To killing another man by shooting him in the chest

856
00:46:59,071 --> 00:46:59,839
That was a white guy

857
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:07,775
Wisconsin man kills girlfriend used him to kill her mother

858
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:11,103
Another way you have the whites

859
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:11,871
Supremacist

860
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:12,895
Who killed his girlfriend

861
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:17,247
Eventually

862
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:18,015
The minor Dan

863
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:20,063
Is that right

864
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:22,367
You know and if he were black he would definitely

865
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:28,767
Have you tried as a minor

866
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:30,047
Children

867
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:31,583
Suspected murder-suicide

868
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:40,031
Husband told police

869
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:44,383
Before killing Crystal Eastfield noodle

870
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:47,455
Miss Transamerica

871
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:51,807
He beat his wife

872
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:52,575
The hammer

873
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:56,415
And then stabbed her to death and then went to the store to get alcohol

874
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:59,231
I'm enrolling

875
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:04,095
Because she kept being mean to him

876
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:05,631
All white people

877
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:09,471
Statistically

878
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:11,263
True is that like 90% of

879
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:12,287
Crime is

880
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:13,055
Not in a row

881
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:15,103
Read her nightstand

882
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:19,455
Crime-ridden scheduled for possible plea in double murder case

883
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:29,439
Now it's all it's all I can all the murders he finds are really there they are

884
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:30,207
Related

885
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:38,911
Speeding is a

886
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:39,679
Dangerous

887
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:46,591
Their crimes against white people being done by racist minorities all the time

888
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:47,615
Is just not looking into

889
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:50,431
Hiding because if you look into the reality of

890
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:52,223
What crime is going on

891
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:54,015
It's usually husband

892
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:55,295
Murphy

893
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:56,063
Amen

894
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:58,367
That goes back to the other

895
00:48:58,623 --> 00:48:59,135
Screaming about

896
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:02,719
So the reality of the world is it Alex's wrong on

897
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:06,559
Lies per minute

898
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:07,583
Really hot

899
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:11,167
Like his lies per minute are now 300 live per second

900
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:12,191
Square

901
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:14,495
No matter how many lies you're telling

902
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:16,031
His lies are accelerating

903
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:17,055
At the same rate of speed

904
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:22,175
Alex said that Oprah

905
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:23,967
Are Oprah because of him

906
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:25,503
The truth is curved

907
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:35,231
Operation

908
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:47,007
He run for president the first time

909
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:52,639
Call

910
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:53,919
President

911
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:56,479
You did

912
00:49:56,735 --> 00:49:59,295
A thunder and President also I just don't know how you can come

913
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:01,343
Complain about someone talking about eugenics

914
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:04,415
Being like you strip medically.

915
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:11,071
I mean I'm just saying that he has four kids right and they're also genetically

916
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:16,191
Superior

917
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:18,495
Whoop

918
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:24,383
If it existed in a vacuum that we want thing and still not great but it exists in the context of everything that Trump

919
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:30,783
Preside over the years about being a Believer and all that stuff

920
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:33,087
One of them nice

921
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:34,623
What is X

922
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:35,647
He's like

923
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:37,695
Directly contradicts

924
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:38,463
Themself

925
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:40,255
Is big

926
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:41,279
And he ought will

927
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:43,583
Accidentally accidentally

928
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:44,607
She's tough guys

929
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:46,655
So

930
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:50,239
Bike race

931
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:53,823
Serena's next clip we're going to listen to a little bit hard yes on

932
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:56,383
Alex's Alex

933
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:57,151
Next

934
00:50:57,919 --> 00:50:59,711
A little bit of an ad

935
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:02,015
Yeah this is for one of his commercials

936
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:03,295
And

937
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:05,087
Problematic

938
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:08,159
Yeah

939
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:53,471
Debate

940
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:05,759
Rationalization

941
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:08,575
Going on

942
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:09,343
Look

943
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:11,903
These are reasonable

944
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:18,815
I'm the one saying it's inherently University

945
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:20,607
Fine if you want to come after somebody

946
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:22,911
Genuinely hate

947
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:24,703
Dude right on here

948
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:29,823
Discuss on a livestream but I didn't have the clip of Alex talking

949
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:31,615
Commercial

950
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:35,967
A real big proponent

951
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:36,991
Handing out flyers

952
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:39,551
On the street to say it's okay to be white

953
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:43,135
There's an article here from December 30th

954
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:44,159
Of last year

955
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:46,975
2017

956
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:49,535
Portland Community College over Christmas weekend

957
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:53,119
Just two weeks ago similar Flyers were found near Portland State University

958
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:55,423
Suggesting an effort to recruit college students

959
00:52:55,935 --> 00:52:59,519
Now you might be asking what what happened really what this was

960
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:08,223
Printed at the bottom of some of the posters is the website of a group called Patriot front a white supremacist organization that sounded

961
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:09,247
After the Charlottesville

962
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:11,039
Virginia unite the right rally

963
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:13,343
The website offers and American fashion

964
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:15,391
Manifesto which as the name suggests

965
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:17,439
Is a declaration of white nationalist

966
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:23,839
The other plastered messages included swastikas and printouts that red it's okay to be white

967
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:24,607
Matter

968
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:25,887
I'm a b****

969
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:26,911
Fan of

970
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:30,239
That prove

971
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:32,287
They're not correct

972
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:35,615
Like it's okay to be white

973
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:36,895
Next to a swastika

974
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:38,431
Is like

975
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:39,199
Not okay.

976
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:45,087
Do I reel it in

977
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:48,671
So when I went over this

978
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:50,207
The last time

979
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:53,535
Not okay to be white

980
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:54,303
Saying it's okay

981
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:57,631
Alex Jones

982
00:53:57,887 --> 00:53:58,655
Can't be oblivious

983
00:53:58,911 --> 00:54:01,215
This sort of stuff he has to know that they kind of taste

984
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:04,287
Of the rhetoric

985
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:06,335
Catchphrases

986
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:11,967
He made a shirt that the top line is it's okay to be white which happens to be

987
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:16,575
A major recruitment slogan for Neo-Nazi groups

988
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:25,023
A little bit about Caddyshack Amanda makes

989
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:31,423
He makes like a lady with the globalist but is this

990
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:33,215
Will mu confuse you for sure

991
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:33,983
Okay

992
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:39,359
Caddyshack

993
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:41,151
Mister squirrel Mister rabbit

994
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:49,599
Big Lots

995
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:58,303
Nothing

996
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:01,119
And watch

997
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:04,191
It's unbelievable that we

998
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:04,959
To this point

999
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:11,103
Because

1000
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:20,063
And you're making s*** up like even just in

1001
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:23,391
When recognizes NAMBLA

1002
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:29,535
That's not true at all we been over this

1003
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:30,815
Caddyshack 2

1004
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:34,399
I know I know it's a joke

1005
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:38,495
It's in

1006
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:41,055
To me you know what I mean

1007
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:47,967
You know I had that I've had this experience before like doing stand-up

1008
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:51,039
Someone does a joke someone else's joke

1009
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:54,111
I'm sorry I didn't realize that

1010
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:55,391
And then you know

1011
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:57,439
A month later you see them doing the job still

1012
00:55:57,695 --> 00:56:01,023
I don't understand how anyone around Alex could be like hey man look

1013
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:02,559
I know what you're trying to do here

1014
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:04,351
NAMBLA doesn't work with

1015
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:08,703
I know I know you want them too I know that would make your world if you look

1016
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:09,727
Moral

1017
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:11,007
Which is not true

1018
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:12,287
You can't keep saying it

1019
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:13,823
Your narrative is wrong

1020
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:18,175
See but that's when we get back to the house to know that's when we get back to

1021
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:21,247
To do people buy his b*******

1022
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:22,783
Like does he does

1023
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:25,087
Whether or not he buys his own b*******

1024
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:26,367
Now we're into like

1025
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:27,903
Does anybody at Infowars

1026
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:30,207
Do they all by Isabel

1027
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:35,583
I would imagine know what I'm going to guess

1028
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:37,119
Is that

1029
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:38,911
People

1030
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:41,471
Have that have that like oh we're going to

1031
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:42,239
I get rich

1032
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:44,031
We're going to make a lot of money

1033
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:46,847
Something along those lines

1034
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:47,615
Their salaries are

1035
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:49,407
You mean all the employees

1036
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:54,271
Yeah probably not great I know right

1037
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:56,063
If you're making forty Grand a year UK

1038
00:56:56,575 --> 00:56:59,135
Handling this NAMBLA b******* Alex Jones

1039
00:56:59,391 --> 00:56:59,903
Makes

1040
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:00,927
Way boys

1041
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:06,047
Write the kids walk away is more than his employees

1042
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:10,143
Probably not great

1043
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:16,543
OK Google forever

1044
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:21,407
Going by Alex is also sort of exactly because he run the night

1045
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:22,175
Play news

1046
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:28,063
60 G

1047
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:30,623
Sure

1048
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:31,391
And then he

1049
00:57:31,647 --> 00:57:33,183
He's worked his way up over the years

1050
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:36,767
That's a pretty good pay raise

1051
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:43,167
Like he's been there for 12 years or whatever you know I don't know if we'll ever be able to figure out exactly what his employees like

1052
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:45,471
But I will tell you that I know how

1053
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:47,007
Is this right here

1054
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:47,775
Direct deposit

1055
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:51,615
Free market

1056
00:57:55,967 --> 00:58:01,343
That's why they're scared

1057
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:03,903
Evil organization on Earth

1058
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:07,231
And she wants to run her mouth about racism

1059
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:10,047
Literally

1060
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:10,815
Boil

1061
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:12,351
Disgusting

1062
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:27,967
Alright

1063
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:31,295
I love videos like at the beginning of that clip he's like

1064
00:58:31,807 --> 00:58:34,623
We women operation toothpaste off straight-shooting

1065
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:41,279
I'm going to use manipulative tricks wherein I create a field

1066
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:53,311
Very existence that you have lost your life

1067
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:55,615
These products

1068
00:58:55,871 --> 00:59:02,015
Mostly live

1069
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:03,551
Straight-shooting

1070
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:05,599
You don't get more shooting

1071
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:07,647
Straight then deep Earth iodine

1072
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:15,071
I love whenever we get multiple disgraceful add pivots in

1073
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:17,375
But in this next clip

1074
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:18,143
Alex

1075
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:19,679
Have something

1076
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:20,703
You might have learned

1077
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:21,471
You might have learned

1078
00:59:22,751 --> 00:59:23,263
And that is

1079
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:24,543
The moral lesson

1080
00:59:25,055 --> 00:59:26,079
He thinks

1081
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:28,383
But this whole time

1082
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:30,431
He's been bonding with Trump

1083
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:33,503
I meant the two of them have been vibing

1084
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:34,271
Right

1085
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:35,551
That's what he thought

1086
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:36,831
But it turns out

1087
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:39,391
He recently saw someone on television

1088
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:41,183
Going up against Jake

1089
00:59:41,439 --> 00:59:45,023
Realizes they are but

1090
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:46,047
Good spirits

1091
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:47,327
Hold on

1092
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:48,863
Wait for it this is f***** up is

1093
00:59:53,983 --> 00:59:55,519
Thirtysomething

1094
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:04,479
You really shouldn't say I researched Miller and

1095
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:05,503
Limbsaver things are about

1096
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:09,855
Do you mean High School

1097
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:34,175
Far they come

1098
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:41,087
To do

1099
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:51,839
Now hold on hold on hold on

1100
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:55,423
Wait cuz I only pause this cuz I wanted you to reset for a second

1101
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:57,471
To hear how this goes out to break

1102
01:00:57,983 --> 01:00:59,775
Did he get cut off by the brake

1103
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:01,311
He would have just kept rambling

1104
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:02,335
This is

1105
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:08,479
Had every angle of what they were about to try and what they're about to do and then

1106
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:11,039
It was Miller

1107
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:14,623
What about this

1108
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:32,031
And just goes out to Brett

1109
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:34,079
In the middle of a word

1110
01:01:34,335 --> 01:01:40,479
You at break I could not be surprised by what white people

1111
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:45,343
Steven Miller being compared to Martin

1112
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:46,879
Luther King

1113
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:47,647
Junior

1114
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:50,207
Jonathan takes a goddamn

1115
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:51,999
I would say that

1116
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:57,375
Favorite Steve Miller abracadabra

1117
01:01:58,911 --> 01:02:02,495
Univision did a really interesting exploration

1118
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:03,519
Into

1119
01:02:04,031 --> 01:02:04,543
Miller's life

1120
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:07,871
They found

1121
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:14,015
I found was a buddy Jason Isla's

1122
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:15,295
High School

1123
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:17,343
She got a call

1124
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:19,647
From him

1125
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:23,487
People who knew Miller in high school said he was a bigot back then

1126
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:26,303
Expressed expressly ended childhood friendships with

1127
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:27,583
Latino students over there

1128
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:28,351
Ethnicity

1129
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:31,423
Quote I can't be your friend anymore because you're Latino

1130
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:35,519
No Jason Isla said he was told by Miller December before they began High School

1131
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:37,567
In fact

1132
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:38,847
Journalism from Univision

1133
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:42,943
They covered up instances

1134
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:46,015
Another student Natalie Flores that Miller had quotes

1135
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:48,831
An intense hatred for people of color especially towards the

1136
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:51,647
Problems with Latinos

1137
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:54,207
He thought they lived off welfare said Flores

1138
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:55,231
Now a grad student

1139
01:02:55,487 --> 01:02:56,255
The Columbia

1140
01:02:57,023 --> 01:03:03,167
Get another student Charles Gould who attended elementary through high school with Stephen Miller called him quote and unabashed

1141
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:05,471
Will continue he was constantly making

1142
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:09,311
Disparaging remarks about the African-American Latino and Asian students at our schools

1143
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:11,615
Multiple former classmates

1144
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:14,175
Including a professional baseball player Cody Decker

1145
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:19,551
I've also spoken out about how Miller was booed off stage by 4,000 students running for class president

1146
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:23,391
Some of Miller's fellow high school students now say they are alarmed by the power he's

1147
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:25,439
Two-wheeled he's very dangerous

1148
01:03:25,695 --> 01:03:26,207
What is love

1149
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:30,559
One one thing as a kid who makes inappropriate comments in the high school newspaper

1150
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:33,119
And another is letting him right presidential orders

1151
01:03:33,631 --> 01:03:35,679
And they say they recognized Miller's boy

1152
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:37,215
When they listen to Trump speeches

1153
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:41,567
Rosemary and said that the high school

1154
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:43,103
Gave him an eerie feeling

1155
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:45,919
It's like you're reading Trump's words written by a 6

1156
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:47,455
16 year old kid in California

1157
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:52,831
Little confident people from his bastard like as a f****** bigot

1158
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:54,367
Also this one is just for fun

1159
01:03:55,647 --> 01:03:59,487
He's the most sanctimonious student I think I ever encountered said John Bernie

1160
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:00,511
Duke's former

1161
01:04:01,023 --> 01:04:03,327
Senior vice president of public affairs and government relations

1162
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:05,119
He seems to be

1163
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:08,959
Absolutely sure of his own views in the correctness of them

1164
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:14,335
I've seem to assume that if you were in disagreement with him there was something malevolent or stupid about your thinking

1165
01:04:14,591 --> 01:04:15,871
Incredibly

1166
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:19,199
I mean Alex was vibing with

1167
01:04:19,711 --> 01:04:21,503
No totally white nationalist

1168
01:04:21,759 --> 01:04:25,087
Do recognize each other game recognize game

1169
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:28,671
There's a really fascinating thing there that Alex

1170
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:29,439
Got it

1171
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:33,279
I don't know

1172
01:04:33,535 --> 01:04:35,327
Google Doodle

1173
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:37,119
Doubt

1174
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:38,655
Alex Jones is a white nationalist

1175
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:41,215
No Doubt

1176
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:43,007
Either white National

1177
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:44,287
Stephen Miller

1178
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:47,615
You know what's great about him

1179
01:04:48,383 --> 01:04:51,455
You can really it look if you're willing to work hard

1180
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:54,783
And you are white racist God damn it if you can't

1181
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:57,087
It's so weird cuz I was like

1182
01:04:57,343 --> 01:04:57,855
I thought it was

1183
01:04:58,367 --> 01:04:59,135
All this time

1184
01:04:59,391 --> 01:05:01,439
Turns out that the squirrel young bigot

1185
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:07,327
If you're going to say anyway

1186
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:14,239
Michael Wolff

1187
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:15,263
F****** look at

1188
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:17,055
A b******* ass

1189
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:20,895
Freedom from a mile away

1190
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:23,967
To me whenever Alex has

1191
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:29,343
These breakthroughs that we think are breakthroughs but are also completely different directions

1192
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:31,903
He's been an antique his whole life

1193
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:36,767
Of course I would have bonded with him and we're like oh my God

1194
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:38,303
Congratulations on their breakthrough

1195
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:42,399
You should take it to the next step you should realize

1196
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:43,423
Just because

1197
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:46,495
He wants white people to have privilege over everybody else

1198
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:52,895
Show me thinks all other races are inferior

1199
01:05:56,223 --> 01:06:00,063
Expresses the feeling that he has that he

1200
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:01,855
This is a little bit historical

1201
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:02,879
Glee grandiose

1202
01:06:10,303 --> 01:06:10,815
But

1203
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:19,263
I want to really stand

1204
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:22,335
I want my John Hancock

1205
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:29,247
Cuz you're gay Alex Jones

1206
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:33,855
To be the big man

1207
01:06:42,303 --> 01:06:44,351
We're going to put ourselves right in the enemies way

1208
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:48,191
Looking for the

1209
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:51,775
He seems to think that he's going to be a new founding father

1210
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:55,871
Either that or the first against the wall when the revolution comes

1211
01:06:56,639 --> 01:06:59,199
It's interesting to me because even a

1212
01:06:59,455 --> 01:07:01,247
Like I get to little grandiose

1213
01:07:01,759 --> 01:07:02,527
He has a little bit of a

1214
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:03,551
The pie-in-the-sky kind of

1215
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:06,879
Conception or chat is like

1216
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:08,671
Trump 1776

1217
01:07:08,927 --> 01:07:09,951
2.0 baby

1218
01:07:10,463 --> 01:07:11,231
Drudge

1219
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:12,767
Alex Jones

1220
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:19,167
Not anymore money

1221
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:20,191
You get it

1222
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:21,471
They're the ones who were going to be

1223
01:07:21,983 --> 01:07:24,287
Credited with creating a new Republic

1224
01:07:27,103 --> 01:07:28,127
Do you get your plan

1225
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:29,663
It will be

1226
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:31,967
Right

1227
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:36,831
Do we actually need glue

1228
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:37,599
That would be

1229
01:07:38,879 --> 01:07:40,415
Tragic remerica

1230
01:07:40,671 --> 01:07:41,695
But the fact that he is

1231
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:42,975
A white nationalist

1232
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:47,071
Bob authoritarian d********** you know he

1233
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:48,351
I don't mean that many

1234
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:51,679
He would folate and authoritarian

1235
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:53,215
With Glee

1236
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:55,007
Right

1237
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:59,359
I'm not jumping in on you or your bandwagon

1238
01:07:59,615 --> 01:08:01,919
I could we talk about Alex so negatively I don't want to

1239
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:04,991
Say he's gay cuz it sounds like that's a negative then we're coming

1240
01:08:06,783 --> 01:08:08,063
Negative

1241
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:10,879
I'm assuming how people might hear it and I'm getting celkon

1242
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:23,679
Not living the life you should live his truth

1243
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:27,519
Do we actually have to

1244
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:28,799
Start like being like okay

1245
01:08:31,871 --> 01:08:33,407
Overthrowing the government

1246
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:38,783
Like a year-and-a-half ago

1247
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:44,671
Call it a counter-coup and I don't know I don't know

1248
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:45,695
Take that are processed

1249
01:08:45,951 --> 01:08:47,231
Bees that are in place

1250
01:08:49,023 --> 01:08:51,071
Let's just try and live our lives today

1251
01:08:53,887 --> 01:08:55,423
Alex

1252
01:08:56,447 --> 01:08:56,959
Steam stats

1253
01:08:57,215 --> 01:09:00,287
Nationalist Boogeyman wherever

1254
01:09:00,543 --> 01:09:02,335
Hugo's lizard

1255
01:09:03,103 --> 01:09:04,895
Okay well

1256
01:09:05,151 --> 01:09:09,247
Is there lizard people for that bright

1257
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:11,551
These are just evil like this one

1258
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:15,391
And I'm not talking about like misguided or anything like that

1259
01:09:15,647 --> 01:09:18,207
I think we're actually good we actually have to say

1260
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:20,511
These are bad human beings

1261
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:24,863
Malevolent

1262
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:26,911
In there

1263
01:09:27,423 --> 01:09:27,935
Their act

1264
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:28,959
Only trying

1265
01:09:29,215 --> 01:09:30,495
To subjugate others

1266
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:31,263
Human beings

1267
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:34,591
I'm not in a globalist way but in a Raceway

1268
01:09:34,847 --> 01:09:35,615
I don't know how to

1269
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:36,895
The problem with

1270
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:38,943
Talking about Alex Jones

1271
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:42,015
You get back into his I know you are but what am I

1272
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:43,295
Like I'm talking to him

1273
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:49,695
Because what he's doing is he's just saying all of the things that are true about him about other people's

1274
01:09:49,951 --> 01:09:53,279
And even push it back without being like

1275
01:09:53,535 --> 01:09:55,327
The best defense

1276
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:56,095
You can use

1277
01:09:56,351 --> 01:09:57,631
In the world is

1278
01:09:57,887 --> 01:09:59,167
Whatever someone would use

1279
01:09:59,423 --> 01:10:01,983
Against you or describing what people would use again

1280
01:10:03,007 --> 01:10:05,311
Cuz then it just becomes a like

1281
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:08,127
How do you how do you even

1282
01:10:08,639 --> 01:10:10,431
Listen to Alex Jones say things like

1283
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:14,783
The globalists are trying to divide you based upon race and then

1284
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:16,319
Support Stephen Miller

1285
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:19,903
What's 2 / 0

1286
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:23,999
Like how do you how do you even know how do you even come back

1287
01:10:24,255 --> 01:10:25,279
Whenever it's like

1288
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:30,655
Nike what do you say not just support Stephen Miller

1289
01:10:30,911 --> 01:10:35,007
The times were there on the same wavelength

1290
01:10:35,519 --> 01:10:36,287
Much more than

1291
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:37,055
Support

1292
01:10:37,311 --> 01:10:38,591
Anyway I don't know

1293
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:40,639
You know what what we do now

1294
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:46,015
He does we know he goes to Luby's how is Luby's

1295
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:52,159
This is not about love

1296
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:56,255
Diner

1297
01:10:56,511 --> 01:10:57,791
Does Alex go to Luby's menu

1298
01:10:58,047 --> 01:10:58,559
Start sprinkler

1299
01:10:58,815 --> 01:10:59,327
Breadcrumbs

1300
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:01,375
Like on the on the little desk

1301
01:11:01,631 --> 01:11:02,911
Like I like an old man

1302
01:11:03,167 --> 01:11:03,679
For ducks but it's

1303
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:04,447
For old women

1304
01:11:04,703 --> 01:11:07,007
With therapy

1305
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:09,567
Backpack at the bottom of it

1306
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:11,615
Chicken in Moana

1307
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:17,247
Different Diner a little bit of a nostalgic throwback Diner

1308
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:18,015
You saw something

1309
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:18,783
But nobody wants to

1310
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:22,367
I saw a mural

1311
01:11:22,623 --> 01:11:23,391
On the wall

1312
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:27,743
Place called Waterloo ice house that's a pretty good little diner

1313
01:11:28,767 --> 01:11:29,279
And

1314
01:11:30,559 --> 01:11:34,911
I've been doing it for years I really noticed it is because it was just nostalgic Americana

1315
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:38,495
I guess I'm a red X Beer Red Cross

1316
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:43,359
And a woman with his

1317
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:45,151
Golf cart

1318
01:11:51,295 --> 01:11:52,575
His wife is pissing

1319
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:13,823
It's also nationalistic

1320
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:22,015
Webster said oh yeah you're crazy lucky loggers not even around anymore

1321
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:23,551
As if that even matter

1322
01:12:24,831 --> 01:12:30,975
And does any of this matter Alex

1323
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:34,559
Blender

1324
01:12:38,655 --> 01:12:40,191
I don't even know what he's talking

1325
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:44,543
I don't know when

1326
01:12:45,055 --> 01:12:50,687
Hard pass. You have this with whatever it is you want this to be fun

1327
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:55,807
Confide start dying your hair

1328
01:12:58,879 --> 01:13:00,415
How to talk

1329
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:04,511
Take a swig and you start talking I'm like

1330
01:13:05,535 --> 01:13:08,607
But what are you trying to do is deflect about ideas

1331
01:13:08,863 --> 01:13:13,983
I think the people have about representation and just trying to create a straw man

1332
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:18,079
Mystically posted on

1333
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:24,991
Where are you still in Columbia

1334
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:26,015
63 Diner

1335
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:29,855
It was like that it was like that kind of Dino that strobe

1336
01:13:30,111 --> 01:13:30,623
Nostalgia

1337
01:13:30,879 --> 01:13:34,975
Yeah it's a little creepy but not because it's all mostly it is

1338
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:37,535
It's just a little creepy cuz it's like

1339
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:40,607
Like people to recreate the

1340
01:13:40,863 --> 01:13:45,215
Weird

1341
01:13:45,727 --> 01:13:46,751
But I wouldn't like it

1342
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:49,823
But also the other thing is

1343
01:13:51,103 --> 01:13:53,151
Although now that I think about it the Saved by the

1344
01:13:57,759 --> 01:13:59,295
Lot of white people in that one

1345
01:13:59,551 --> 01:14:04,159
He's misrepresenting to that like people talk about

1346
01:14:04,415 --> 01:14:04,927
Phyno

1347
01:14:05,183 --> 01:14:05,695
Minority

1348
01:14:06,207 --> 01:14:06,719
An adze

1349
01:14:07,231 --> 01:14:08,767
Okay family

1350
01:14:10,047 --> 01:14:11,583
People complaining

1351
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:13,119
About those eyes

1352
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:14,399
People rely

1353
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:18,751
Why is there a gay couple in my Cheerios commercial

1354
01:14:19,519 --> 01:14:24,127
The people who are complaining about stuff is not Christmas

1355
01:14:24,383 --> 01:14:27,455
See your whole lot of people who are like

1356
01:14:28,735 --> 01:14:29,247
No

1357
01:14:29,503 --> 01:14:30,527
Well I mean

1358
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:33,599
Real grief

1359
01:14:34,367 --> 01:14:35,135
Chatsworth

1360
01:14:35,647 --> 01:14:39,231
How many how many women directors have won

1361
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:42,559
Best Director of course

1362
01:14:42,815 --> 01:14:43,327
Of course that's

1363
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:50,239
Nobody is it in terms of

1364
01:14:50,495 --> 01:14:51,263
Oppressive complaints

1365
01:14:51,775 --> 01:14:52,799
I would argue that

1366
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:54,079
The people who are mad

1367
01:14:54,335 --> 01:14:55,359
About black family

1368
01:14:55,615 --> 01:14:58,431
Commercials

1369
01:14:58,687 --> 01:15:00,479
To complain a bit more

1370
01:15:00,735 --> 01:15:02,271
It all went downhill

1371
01:15:02,783 --> 01:15:05,855
I was all over after that

1372
01:15:06,111 --> 01:15:10,207
Beginning of YouTube

1373
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:16,863
You can make the argument that Janet Jackson at the Superbowl destroyed the world

1374
01:15:17,119 --> 01:15:18,143
Peripheral

1375
01:15:18,399 --> 01:15:19,679
Triple

1376
01:15:19,935 --> 01:15:25,311
Justin Timberlake is responsible for the destruction of the world and the rise of white nationalism

1377
01:15:25,567 --> 01:15:31,711
That sounds right correlation causation

1378
01:15:34,271 --> 01:15:36,063
That f*****

1379
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:39,135
Sojourn now we're going to jump into a little bit of business

1380
01:15:39,647 --> 01:15:40,415
Was he

1381
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:41,695
NSYNC or

1382
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:47,071
NSYNC Chris Kirkpatrick

1383
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:49,631
Call Dan Joey Fatone

1384
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:53,983
Is right I know all the members of NSYNC problem from the

1385
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:55,519
Beginning now Backstreet Boys

1386
01:15:57,055 --> 01:15:59,103
I'm just going to point this out alright

1387
01:15:59,615 --> 01:16:00,127
Did the temptation

1388
01:16:00,383 --> 01:16:01,407
Race war

1389
01:16:01,663 --> 01:16:02,687
They didn't

1390
01:16:02,943 --> 01:16:03,967
Delete to a temporal

1391
01:16:05,247 --> 01:16:06,783
See there we go

1392
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:08,319
Black boy bands all the time

1393
01:16:08,575 --> 01:16:09,855
Jordan

1394
01:16:10,623 --> 01:16:11,647
I don't want to say that

1395
01:16:12,415 --> 01:16:12,927
Jordan

1396
01:16:13,183 --> 01:16:13,695
The weird thing to say

1397
01:16:17,791 --> 01:16:18,559
My last episode

1398
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:19,583
We talked about

1399
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:20,351
Doo-wop group

1400
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:24,447
You want done

1401
01:16:24,703 --> 01:16:28,543
Episode we talked about ranting about Brian

1402
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:32,127
And one of the things that we know

1403
01:16:32,383 --> 01:16:32,895
From

1404
01:16:33,151 --> 01:16:33,919
Knowing Alex

1405
01:16:34,431 --> 01:16:35,967
Is that there was a lot of

1406
01:16:36,223 --> 01:16:36,735
Anti-semitism

1407
01:16:37,503 --> 01:16:38,271
We know that

1408
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:41,087
We also know that he just doesn't like Brian Stelzer.

1409
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:45,439
We also know that

1410
01:16:45,695 --> 01:16:47,231
Some of it was fairly

1411
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:51,583
In terms of his performative aspect Wrench It Like That

1412
01:16:51,839 --> 01:16:52,351
Gametime

1413
01:16:52,607 --> 01:16:54,655
The level of anger that he was

1414
01:16:55,167 --> 01:16:55,679
Expressing

1415
01:16:56,703 --> 01:16:57,727
Visceral

1416
01:16:58,495 --> 01:16:59,775
Whether or not

1417
01:17:00,031 --> 01:17:01,567
Is the best actor in the world

1418
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:04,127
He

1419
01:17:04,383 --> 01:17:09,503
Was really feeling anger like he was actually angry

1420
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:11,551
Certainly

1421
01:17:12,063 --> 01:17:13,599
Here's the argument that I want to make

1422
01:17:13,855 --> 01:17:16,159
There's two possibilities actually Bryan seltzer

1423
01:17:16,671 --> 01:17:19,231
Know what is the lightest real response

1424
01:17:19,743 --> 01:17:20,767
He is like

1425
01:17:23,839 --> 01:17:26,143
That and that is not very

1426
01:17:26,399 --> 01:17:26,911
Eloquent

1427
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:28,191
Certainly

1428
01:17:28,447 --> 01:17:29,215
He's kind of

1429
01:17:29,983 --> 01:17:32,031
Kind of a gross creep

1430
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:34,847
And then the other alternative inclusion

1431
01:17:35,103 --> 01:17:35,615
That one's true

1432
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:41,503
Write the other alternative is

1433
01:17:41,759 --> 01:17:42,527
And that is

1434
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:43,807
He was trolling peep

1435
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:45,343
It was Fat Tire

1436
01:17:49,695 --> 01:17:51,999
Satire is the literal world

1437
01:17:53,023 --> 01:17:53,791
Tire attire

1438
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:59,423
Are you sure he wasn't saying he was playing the sitar

1439
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:02,751
No you said it's satire and that he was trolling

1440
01:18:03,007 --> 01:18:04,799
What are the article about it

1441
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:06,335
The argument that he makes

1442
01:18:06,591 --> 01:18:07,871
Is that he was having fun

1443
01:18:08,127 --> 01:18:09,407
And he was letting himself off the

1444
01:18:09,663 --> 01:18:11,199
Just letting himself loose off

1445
01:18:11,455 --> 01:18:11,967
Off the train

1446
01:18:12,223 --> 01:18:14,783
And if that's the case that. Still not set

1447
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:20,927
No certainly not use notes at

1448
01:18:21,183 --> 01:18:24,511
Himself off the tree

1449
01:18:25,023 --> 01:18:27,327
Cuz then when you get off the chain

1450
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:28,351
You spout

1451
01:18:28,607 --> 01:18:29,631
Anti-semitism

1452
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:34,751
So if you're saying that I just let myself go and sort of.

1453
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:36,287
Then what you feel

1454
01:18:36,799 --> 01:18:38,079
Is anti-Semitic bigot

1455
01:18:39,103 --> 01:18:39,871
That's a problem

1456
01:18:40,383 --> 01:18:40,895
Also

1457
01:18:41,663 --> 01:18:42,175
Still not.

1458
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:43,711
Also

1459
01:18:44,223 --> 01:18:45,247
I mean

1460
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:48,319
This is not this

1461
01:18:48,831 --> 01:18:50,879
Family fun but it'll be what it is

1462
01:18:51,135 --> 01:18:52,159
Because here's what

1463
01:18:52,671 --> 01:18:53,951
Alex Jones covers

1464
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:55,231
The Young Turks

1465
01:18:55,743 --> 01:18:56,255
Covering

1466
01:18:57,791 --> 01:18:59,839
At the third hour of the show

1467
01:19:00,095 --> 01:19:00,863
Alex Jones

1468
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:03,935
Breakdowns them breaking down his

1469
01:19:04,959 --> 01:19:08,031
Which That Could Be Santa

1470
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:11,615
Then but then are we going to

1471
01:19:13,151 --> 01:19:14,175
Breaking down the

1472
01:19:14,431 --> 01:19:15,455
Turks breaking him

1473
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:17,247
I hope no never

1474
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:20,831
Never going Gaspard

1475
01:19:21,087 --> 01:19:21,599
Send him breaking down

1476
01:19:22,367 --> 01:19:28,511
About him breaking down The Young Turks breaking him down

1477
01:19:28,767 --> 01:19:32,863
Breaking him down

1478
01:19:33,119 --> 01:19:36,447
Inevitably breaking down his breakdown of their brain

1479
01:19:36,703 --> 01:19:39,519
I just want to know when somebody's going to covered our breakdown

1480
01:19:41,311 --> 01:19:46,943
I went over your break

1481
01:19:47,967 --> 01:19:50,783
Alex is literal breakdown wearing he let himself up

1482
01:19:52,319 --> 01:19:54,367
Hookah

1483
01:19:55,135 --> 01:19:56,927
So

1484
01:19:57,183 --> 01:19:59,231
At what point does Alex Jones become a crypt

1485
01:19:59,487 --> 01:20:03,327
Now this is a good Quest request

1486
01:20:04,095 --> 01:20:06,655
In the first clip of the ranch

1487
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:09,215
Is where he he says that it's at

1488
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:11,007
Again we can

1489
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:13,567
Very much disagree with that cuz no matter what it is

1490
01:20:13,824 --> 01:20:14,848
It's not session

1491
01:20:20,992 --> 01:20:25,088
Culture he wants to control the media

1492
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:27,904
I think he thinks

1493
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:30,208
Better metaphor is satire

1494
01:20:30,464 --> 01:20:34,304
That's the only thing I've got to go on so far or hyperbole

1495
01:20:34,816 --> 01:20:36,608
Possibly

1496
01:20:37,376 --> 01:20:37,888
What else

1497
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:43,264
If you want want to try and use that literary Trump wear

1498
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:47,872
For the entirety of the

1499
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:59,136
Alex did not bring up Jared from Subway at all during that rap now claiming

1500
01:20:59,392 --> 01:20:59,904
We got the receipt

1501
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:06,304
He's claiming that like it was that tire I just talked about how he looks weird and it's like the whole media also I was bringing up

1502
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:08,096
Good-looking f****** weird nope

1503
01:21:08,352 --> 01:21:09,888
It was only about Michael Wolff

1504
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:12,960
Why does filter looks

1505
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:16,032
Okay

1506
01:21:21,408 --> 01:21:23,200
Having some fun is

1507
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:24,736
Ladies and gentlemen

1508
01:21:24,992 --> 01:21:30,368
Yes I believe shelter people

1509
01:21:35,488 --> 01:21:38,304
Fun

1510
01:21:40,608 --> 01:21:42,144
Having fun

1511
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:44,704
That makes it even less clear

1512
01:21:45,728 --> 01:21:48,032
Cuz I really do believe these things

1513
01:21:48,288 --> 01:21:49,312
I was having fun

1514
01:21:51,616 --> 01:21:52,640
No

1515
01:21:52,896 --> 01:21:54,176
Well it was satire

1516
01:21:54,432 --> 01:21:54,944
Right

1517
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:56,480
I mean I mean what I said

1518
01:21:56,736 --> 01:21:57,248
Bright

1519
01:21:58,272 --> 01:22:00,320
And also I was yelling about it

1520
01:22:00,576 --> 01:22:02,112
Do people think

1521
01:22:02,368 --> 01:22:04,160
I don't mean what I say that I'm acting

1522
01:22:04,672 --> 01:22:06,208
No I believe what I said

1523
01:22:06,464 --> 01:22:08,256
And I let myself off the chain

1524
01:22:08,512 --> 01:22:13,888
To say it louder like I mean

1525
01:22:14,144 --> 01:22:16,960
Chief example of satire Borrego Springs

1526
01:22:17,216 --> 01:22:21,056
Just say what he meant

1527
01:22:21,312 --> 01:22:23,360
Aggressively

1528
01:22:28,736 --> 01:22:31,040
Or even if it was

1529
01:22:31,296 --> 01:22:32,576
YouTube

1530
01:22:34,112 --> 01:22:37,184
I don't understand like I get what I think

1531
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:37,952
He think

1532
01:22:38,464 --> 01:22:44,096
And that is that like a I was goofing around I was hoping to get more attention to myself and Hate

1533
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:48,960
Cuz it sounds smart and I don't really know why

1534
01:22:49,216 --> 01:22:50,752
It went when these dumb dudes

1535
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:54,592
Say they were being satirical what they really mean to say is

1536
01:22:54,848 --> 01:22:55,872
I thought I was joking

1537
01:22:56,128 --> 01:22:56,896
Or at least

1538
01:22:57,152 --> 01:23:00,224
Tell you that I was joking even though I was telling the truth

1539
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:03,040
But if I say I was joking

1540
01:23:03,296 --> 01:23:09,440
Sounds like I'm kind of an idiot implies it also implies that anytime I show passion

1541
01:23:09,696 --> 01:23:11,488
Or these like

1542
01:23:11,744 --> 01:23:16,608
Fake crying and stuff like that I'm faking it and I kind of invalidates a lot of my passions

1543
01:23:16,864 --> 01:23:22,240
To the audience

1544
01:23:29,664 --> 01:23:34,272
Okay here's a here's the new here's the new thing if we ever do interview

1545
01:23:34,784 --> 01:23:35,296
We won't

1546
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:36,832
No question

1547
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:38,112
Just

1548
01:23:38,368 --> 01:23:39,904
The definition of satire

1549
01:23:40,416 --> 01:23:40,928
Blighted ovum

1550
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:42,464
I mean just like

1551
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:43,488
Justice be like

1552
01:23:44,256 --> 01:23:44,768
Here you go

1553
01:23:45,536 --> 01:23:47,584
End of interview

1554
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:48,352
Like

1555
01:23:48,608 --> 01:23:50,144
A good interview with Trump

1556
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:50,912
Should be

1557
01:23:51,424 --> 01:23:52,192
Space questions

1558
01:23:52,448 --> 01:23:58,592
And feels like do you know not even not even a question about everything

1559
01:23:58,848 --> 01:24:04,992
The Electoral College is the UN right much more Illuminating

1560
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:10,880
Prove the globalist

1561
01:24:11,136 --> 01:24:11,648
Exist

1562
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:16,256
Horse

1563
01:24:16,512 --> 01:24:20,352
Strategy

1564
01:24:20,608 --> 01:24:22,912
Like a hawk

1565
01:24:26,496 --> 01:24:27,008
Small chunks

1566
01:24:27,264 --> 01:24:27,776
A lot of

1567
01:24:28,032 --> 01:24:32,128
Open places right

1568
01:24:33,408 --> 01:24:33,920
At the beginning

1569
01:24:34,176 --> 01:24:34,944
But he was trigger

1570
01:24:35,968 --> 01:24:36,736
It's delger triggers

1571
01:24:37,504 --> 01:24:38,784
Which implies that it was

1572
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:43,136
Celestron Tire reaction of

1573
01:24:43,392 --> 01:24:45,952
I don't know

1574
01:24:47,488 --> 01:24:49,536
He gets to starting his coverage of

1575
01:24:49,792 --> 01:24:51,072
The Young Turks talking about him

1576
01:24:59,776 --> 01:25:01,312
Really Treasures me

1577
01:25:08,736 --> 01:25:14,880
From golf

1578
01:25:23,072 --> 01:25:24,096
Are you sick

1579
01:25:29,984 --> 01:25:30,752
Heartland

1580
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:38,688
Really concerned me the most

1581
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:43,040
A good point was made in the chat room that they're already wasn't America

1582
01:25:43,296 --> 01:25:48,160
I'm psycho 20-something it's okay

1583
01:25:48,416 --> 01:25:50,208
That's a good point

1584
01:25:50,464 --> 01:25:52,000
Take a look at the video

1585
01:25:54,048 --> 01:25:57,888
Laughing over his

1586
01:26:24,256 --> 01:26:26,048
Children done too far down the rabbit hole

1587
01:26:26,304 --> 01:26:28,096
It's like a

1588
01:26:28,352 --> 01:26:34,496
The only reason I kept that in there is because you can hear him laughing in the background

1589
01:26:34,752 --> 01:26:36,800
In his work but there's also I mean

1590
01:26:37,056 --> 01:26:38,592
I study Alex Jones

1591
01:26:39,104 --> 01:26:39,872
30 language

1592
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:42,432
What is body language

1593
01:26:42,944 --> 01:26:45,760
I don't know such a gifted liar that it's

1594
01:26:46,016 --> 01:26:49,344
Very difficult to tell what's insecure right there was a look of like

1595
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:56,256
Like there was a discomfort on his right

1596
01:26:57,280 --> 01:27:02,656
I think he loves to watch himself I think there was a discomfort and I think it's because he understands that this

1597
01:27:02,912 --> 01:27:04,960
Tire argument is just

1598
01:27:05,216 --> 01:27:07,520
Babe

1599
01:27:07,776 --> 01:27:09,312
I will give him credit for that

1600
01:27:09,824 --> 01:27:15,968
I think he was aware that people going to share the s*** out of this

1601
01:27:17,248 --> 01:27:18,528
You went on an unhinged

1602
01:27:18,784 --> 01:27:19,552
Systematic Ranch

1603
01:27:19,808 --> 01:27:20,576
And I wish you'd listen

1604
01:27:20,832 --> 01:27:21,344
Shobha

1605
01:27:21,856 --> 01:27:22,880
She would have

1606
01:27:23,392 --> 01:27:25,184
Really been afraid of Alex Jones a long time

1607
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:29,280
Ana kasparian

1608
01:27:29,536 --> 01:27:30,048
Say a little bit

1609
01:27:30,304 --> 01:27:31,584
He brings up the anti-semitism

1610
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:32,864
Rings

1611
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:34,912
He doesn't bring a blood libel in a

1612
01:27:35,168 --> 01:27:35,680
It's proper,

1613
01:27:36,448 --> 01:27:39,520
He brings it up as a Nazi rhetorical

1614
01:27:39,776 --> 01:27:45,920
No

1615
01:27:46,176 --> 01:27:46,688
Scream

1616
01:27:46,944 --> 01:27:47,712
News about drink

1617
01:27:49,504 --> 01:27:50,272
He says this

1618
01:27:50,784 --> 01:27:51,296
Kim

1619
01:27:52,576 --> 01:27:53,600
Think about

1620
01:28:05,888 --> 01:28:07,424
I'm at everything I said but I realize

1621
01:28:14,336 --> 01:28:17,152
Bulshit why would I be surprised

1622
01:28:17,408 --> 01:28:18,176
Words are not

1623
01:28:21,248 --> 01:28:22,784
If this is a reaction

1624
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:27,904
He claims

1625
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:29,440
With the 10-minute

1626
01:28:29,696 --> 01:28:32,000
Unhinged hits on

1627
01:28:37,888 --> 01:28:44,032
I want to go pick was Muggsy look like the Joker everywhere

1628
01:28:44,288 --> 01:28:50,432
Alex Jones

1629
01:28:50,688 --> 01:28:52,992
I just watched your audience well

1630
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:55,808
Facebook

1631
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:58,880
Rifle streams are podcast already

1632
01:28:59,136 --> 01:29:00,160
Station's ratings

1633
01:29:02,464 --> 01:29:03,744
Punch the globalist of the nose

1634
01:29:04,768 --> 01:29:05,792
And say stuff like

1635
01:29:10,912 --> 01:29:12,960
He did not that that

1636
01:29:13,216 --> 01:29:14,496
It wasn't what you were saying at all

1637
01:29:15,008 --> 01:29:15,776
If it was

1638
01:29:17,824 --> 01:29:22,688
I don't know I could be different

1639
01:29:22,944 --> 01:29:23,456
But

1640
01:29:23,968 --> 01:29:25,504
It would have gotten as many views that's

1641
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:27,040
Possibly

1642
01:29:28,832 --> 01:29:29,856
I don't think

1643
01:29:30,112 --> 01:29:30,624
That that

1644
01:29:31,136 --> 01:29:31,648
Sara Lee

1645
01:29:31,904 --> 01:29:32,416
Is gold

1646
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:34,464
I would make this argument

1647
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,280
Babies audience well

1648
01:29:37,536 --> 01:29:40,096
It might be because of people who

1649
01:29:41,632 --> 01:29:43,168
Resonate with

1650
01:29:43,424 --> 01:29:44,448
One of the more negative

1651
01:29:44,704 --> 01:29:47,776
Pieces of it I don't think it's very difficult to grow your audience

1652
01:29:48,288 --> 01:29:48,800
Dog whistle

1653
01:29:49,056 --> 01:29:49,568
Really hard

1654
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:55,712
Like I don't think that that is that difficult I think you'll be snoozes number one the ratings for a long time baby

1655
01:29:55,968 --> 01:29:56,480
I don't think

1656
01:29:56,736 --> 01:29:57,248
Don't

1657
01:29:57,760 --> 01:29:58,272
I think if we

1658
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:06,208
Are you saying we should do I'm not a hypothetical

1659
01:30:06,464 --> 01:30:09,536
If we did unhinge the rants that were vaguely

1660
01:30:09,792 --> 01:30:10,304
I guess

1661
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:11,328
Technically not

1662
01:30:11,584 --> 01:30:12,608
Racist but bigoted

1663
01:30:12,864 --> 01:30:13,888
We just did like

1664
01:30:15,168 --> 01:30:16,192
Durant

1665
01:30:16,448 --> 01:30:17,984
I think we could probably grow this a lot

1666
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:20,288
And look

1667
01:30:21,056 --> 01:30:22,080
Call Mike

1668
01:30:22,336 --> 01:30:26,176
Go

1669
01:30:26,432 --> 01:30:27,456
Be fair you have something is Rancid

1670
01:30:27,968 --> 01:30:28,992
White well yeah

1671
01:30:29,248 --> 01:30:31,040
Flights

1672
01:30:31,296 --> 01:30:32,064
Henderson's balancing

1673
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:33,088
Quite frankly

1674
01:30:37,696 --> 01:30:38,208
White people have everything

1675
01:30:38,464 --> 01:30:38,976
Do it that I

1676
01:30:39,488 --> 01:30:41,792
I think that white people are the cause of all of our prop

1677
01:30:42,304 --> 01:30:43,840
Alex

1678
01:30:44,096 --> 01:30:44,608
Text Jones

1679
01:30:45,888 --> 01:30:49,984
He did this during the actual episode the rant was in from the 5th

1680
01:30:50,752 --> 01:30:52,800
He claims that he can't do that evil smile

1681
01:30:53,312 --> 01:30:54,848
Dolphin

1682
01:31:02,784 --> 01:31:07,136
To smile they always

1683
01:31:11,744 --> 01:31:13,280
I love Liberty

1684
01:31:14,304 --> 01:31:15,072
Marshall Lee

1685
01:31:16,096 --> 01:31:17,376
What let me try

1686
01:31:19,168 --> 01:31:21,472
Nice trying to do the smile

1687
01:31:24,032 --> 01:31:25,056
And while he's doing it

1688
01:31:28,128 --> 01:31:30,688
On the screen there flashing up pictures of stelter

1689
01:31:30,944 --> 01:31:31,456
Then Jared

1690
01:31:31,712 --> 01:31:32,224
Subway

1691
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:32,992
Stelter

1692
01:31:33,248 --> 01:31:34,272
Jared from Subway

1693
01:31:34,528 --> 01:31:36,064
Subconscious attempt

1694
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:38,112
To combine the two and your head

1695
01:31:38,368 --> 01:31:39,904
He's moved on from

1696
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:41,440
He looks like Mike Wolfe

1697
01:31:41,696 --> 01:31:42,208
Now it's

1698
01:31:42,464 --> 01:31:42,976
Now it's Jared

1699
01:31:43,488 --> 01:31:49,632
Subway

1700
01:31:49,888 --> 01:31:52,960
Like a disclaimer on the bottom like may cause

1701
01:31:53,472 --> 01:31:54,752
No but it wasn't that bad

1702
01:31:55,264 --> 01:31:57,568
But also it's intentional listen to have equipment

1703
01:31:59,360 --> 01:31:59,872
I'm still trying

1704
01:32:00,896 --> 01:32:01,920
Together

1705
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:12,160
A door wanting to date your daughter

1706
01:32:13,184 --> 01:32:13,696
That's

1707
01:32:13,952 --> 01:32:14,464
Ridiculous

1708
01:32:15,232 --> 01:32:16,000
That's absurd

1709
01:32:16,256 --> 01:32:16,768
Yeah

1710
01:32:17,536 --> 01:32:18,560
First of all

1711
01:32:18,816 --> 01:32:19,584
Second of all

1712
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:20,608
He's trying to create

1713
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:22,144
Uncouple the association

1714
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:25,984
Jared Fogle who is a pedophile and belongs in

1715
01:32:27,264 --> 01:32:29,056
Right

1716
01:32:29,312 --> 01:32:30,080
Who Alex just

1717
01:32:30,336 --> 01:32:31,360
Disagrees with

1718
01:32:32,896 --> 01:32:33,920
Active

1719
01:32:34,688 --> 01:32:36,224
I don't know I died

1720
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:39,040
Again nothing about

1721
01:32:39,296 --> 01:32:42,624
Oprah I think

1722
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:44,416
Is close to legally actionable

1723
01:32:44,928 --> 01:32:45,952
This is repugnant

1724
01:32:46,208 --> 01:32:46,976
But totally

1725
01:32:47,232 --> 01:32:50,816
Allowable totally get away with it

1726
01:32:51,328 --> 01:32:53,632
In terms of someone who claims to be running a

1727
01:32:53,888 --> 01:32:54,912
Operation

1728
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:59,520
Straight-shooting I don't like with a p

1729
01:32:59,776 --> 01:33:00,288
Pedophile

1730
01:33:01,568 --> 01:33:02,848
So in this next clip

1731
01:33:03,872 --> 01:33:05,408
So throughout the season

1732
01:33:05,664 --> 01:33:06,176
Quite a bit

1733
01:33:06,688 --> 01:33:07,712
And it's hard

1734
01:33:07,968 --> 01:33:10,272
Get away from the idea that

1735
01:33:10,528 --> 01:33:11,040
Drink

1736
01:33:11,808 --> 01:33:12,320
Is someone

1737
01:33:12,576 --> 01:33:13,088
Arabic

1738
01:33:14,624 --> 01:33:16,160
Tough to get away from the fact that

1739
01:33:16,416 --> 01:33:16,928
Alex

1740
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:19,232
Cuz he does

1741
01:33:19,488 --> 01:33:20,000
And he's not

1742
01:33:21,536 --> 01:33:22,304
But

1743
01:33:22,816 --> 01:33:23,584
Alex thinks

1744
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:24,608
Season islamist

1745
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:25,632
And that

1746
01:33:25,888 --> 01:33:27,936
Might be

1747
01:33:28,704 --> 01:33:29,216
Right but that

1748
01:33:29,472 --> 01:33:31,008
Might be informing

1749
01:33:32,544 --> 01:33:34,080
Kind of mad about it and why you

1750
01:33:34,336 --> 01:33:35,616
Covering their coverage

1751
01:33:36,128 --> 01:33:38,688
Cuz they could it could have chosen a bunch of people like

1752
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:40,736
Brown

1753
01:33:43,552 --> 01:33:44,064
Something

1754
01:33:44,576 --> 01:33:45,344
Barry f*****-up

1755
01:33:46,368 --> 01:33:46,880
Because

1756
01:33:47,136 --> 01:33:48,160
He's responding

1757
01:33:48,416 --> 01:33:49,696
Defensively about

1758
01:33:49,952 --> 01:33:50,464
The West

1759
01:33:50,976 --> 01:33:51,744
And he says that

1760
01:34:03,008 --> 01:34:04,032
Male race

1761
01:34:18,112 --> 01:34:19,136
What you having

1762
01:34:22,208 --> 01:34:23,232
Anti-female

1763
01:34:23,488 --> 01:34:24,000
System

1764
01:34:26,304 --> 01:34:27,584
Christian and Judea

1765
01:34:28,096 --> 01:34:30,656
Goddess worship

1766
01:34:46,528 --> 01:34:48,832
Are the women

1767
01:34:49,088 --> 01:34:50,880
Spiritual ugly creature

1768
01:34:51,136 --> 01:34:51,648
You're telling us

1769
01:34:51,904 --> 01:34:52,416
Is how you're going to take

1770
01:34:54,464 --> 01:34:56,256
Because you expected

1771
01:34:57,024 --> 01:34:58,048
Do your phone

1772
01:34:58,816 --> 01:35:00,096
Now he's Tire

1773
01:35:01,888 --> 01:35:02,912
Projection

1774
01:35:03,424 --> 01:35:04,704
So it's definitely projection

1775
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:11,104
You're disgusting Fallen blob

1776
01:35:12,384 --> 01:35:13,920
But also that the whole thing is

1777
01:35:14,944 --> 01:35:20,576
That's weird that is such an infantile version of like

1778
01:35:20,832 --> 01:35:22,368
Okay I will.

1779
01:35:22,624 --> 01:35:23,392
The class

1780
01:35:23,648 --> 01:35:25,184
Jordan

1781
01:35:25,952 --> 01:35:26,464
So

1782
01:35:26,976 --> 01:35:31,072
Judeo-christianity never had any issues with women

1783
01:35:32,864 --> 01:35:33,632
Question retracted

1784
01:35:33,888 --> 01:35:36,704
And of course Islam is based on hating women

1785
01:35:39,008 --> 01:35:40,544
But as everybody knows

1786
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:42,848
What America and the West

1787
01:35:43,104 --> 01:35:43,616
Is really about

1788
01:35:46,688 --> 01:35:47,712
Just a regular one

1789
01:35:47,968 --> 01:35:49,504
Spell Europe named after Europa

1790
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:51,040
Right

1791
01:35:51,296 --> 01:35:52,576
I don't know the full Aeneid

1792
01:35:52,832 --> 01:35:55,648
I always thought that America was named after Amerigo Vespucci

1793
01:35:56,160 --> 01:35:58,720
Now it's not I always thought that

1794
01:35:59,488 --> 01:36:03,840
Heard it sometime I just agreed

1795
01:36:04,096 --> 01:36:04,608
I'm still at

1796
01:36:04,864 --> 01:36:07,168
Ey America's gold America

1797
01:36:07,424 --> 01:36:13,568
Like I could be the dude named America could be you're going with this

1798
01:36:13,824 --> 01:36:18,432
I got to apologize to the best as well today like the name until I'm keeping

1799
01:36:21,504 --> 01:36:23,040
I think that it's infantilizing

1800
01:36:23,296 --> 01:36:25,600
To certain degree this idea of

1801
01:36:25,856 --> 01:36:28,416
First of all the idea that our civilization is based on goddess

1802
01:36:28,928 --> 01:36:31,232
Worship apply to

1803
01:36:31,488 --> 01:36:32,512
Old-time version

1804
01:36:32,768 --> 01:36:33,792
The chivalry which are

1805
01:36:34,816 --> 01:36:35,328
Middle Ages

1806
01:36:35,584 --> 01:36:36,608
Which is controlling

1807
01:36:36,864 --> 01:36:39,936
It's a controlling worldview as much as

1808
01:36:40,448 --> 01:36:45,056
You complained about in the in the east

1809
01:36:45,312 --> 01:36:45,824
Making it

1810
01:36:46,336 --> 01:36:47,872
Impossible for her to

1811
01:36:48,384 --> 01:36:48,896
Be your ego

1812
01:36:49,408 --> 01:36:55,296
I am handicapped Punisher

1813
01:36:55,552 --> 01:36:59,136
There's a very fun game to play with the aggressive chivalry

1814
01:37:00,672 --> 01:37:02,976
But I've never heard weird things for him

1815
01:37:03,232 --> 01:37:04,000
To say when he's like

1816
01:37:04,512 --> 01:37:10,400
And you're trying to control your telling us how to control women's like I didn't know

1817
01:37:11,424 --> 01:37:12,960
Very very messed up

1818
01:37:14,496 --> 01:37:15,520
In this next clip

1819
01:37:15,776 --> 01:37:16,544
Alex

1820
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:20,640
You know he's big on personal responsibility we know that

1821
01:37:20,896 --> 01:37:22,688
Part of his world

1822
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:23,712
For everybody

1823
01:37:24,224 --> 01:37:27,808
Right cuz in this Cliff he blames literally everybody for his custard

1824
01:37:28,064 --> 01:37:30,112
City battle other than himself

1825
01:37:36,512 --> 01:37:38,816
And I said I shouldn't have kids and he's very show set it

1826
01:37:41,376 --> 01:37:42,656
Wife is a CPS

1827
01:37:43,936 --> 01:37:47,264
Chicago public

1828
01:37:52,896 --> 01:37:55,968
Scumbags

1829
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:57,504
He's talking about the young

1830
01:37:58,272 --> 01:38:01,344
Yeah that

1831
01:38:01,856 --> 01:38:02,368
When

1832
01:38:04,672 --> 01:38:05,184
You

1833
01:38:05,952 --> 01:38:07,488
You can't possibly think that's

1834
01:38:07,744 --> 01:38:08,256
Reality

1835
01:38:08,768 --> 01:38:10,560
You and your behavior

1836
01:38:10,816 --> 01:38:11,840
I've got you where you are

1837
01:38:12,608 --> 01:38:13,888
You and your ex-wife

1838
01:38:14,656 --> 01:38:15,680
You got

1839
01:38:17,728 --> 01:38:19,776
And that's just a regular thing it is

1840
01:38:20,288 --> 01:38:20,800
Like that's a thing

1841
01:38:21,056 --> 01:38:22,848
It is

1842
01:38:23,104 --> 01:38:23,872
Kind of a part of it

1843
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:27,200
And I don't know the truth of it cuz I don't really

1844
01:38:27,456 --> 01:38:29,504
I don't particularly care about

1845
01:38:30,272 --> 01:38:34,112
People's personal lives because there's so many variables you really know what's going on

1846
01:38:34,624 --> 01:38:38,464
It's impossible to make comment on stuff like

1847
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:39,744
Maybe he is a good father

1848
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:43,584
Possible possible

1849
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:44,608
If this all isn't it

1850
01:38:46,144 --> 01:38:50,752
I don't know the thing that comes down to for me is the only two possibilities

1851
01:38:51,264 --> 01:38:52,544
Either

1852
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:53,568
Desertion

1853
01:38:53,824 --> 01:38:54,848
His ex-wife is made

1854
01:38:55,104 --> 01:38:56,128
Radar true

1855
01:38:56,384 --> 01:38:57,664
Or they're not

1856
01:38:58,688 --> 01:39:00,992
And he was still married to her for 8 years

1857
01:39:01,248 --> 01:39:02,784
Or whatever 10 years

1858
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:04,320
And this is

1859
01:39:04,576 --> 01:39:06,880
Unfortunately a piece that comes along with that

1860
01:39:07,392 --> 01:39:07,904
So

1861
01:39:08,416 --> 01:39:09,184
None of my business

1862
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:15,584
The liberal media they came down to try and take your kids

1863
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:17,376
Own up to your life

1864
01:39:18,144 --> 01:39:18,656
Taken away from him

1865
01:39:18,912 --> 01:39:19,424
I want to

1866
01:39:19,936 --> 01:39:20,448
Livelihood

1867
01:39:20,704 --> 01:39:21,472
His home

1868
01:39:23,008 --> 01:39:24,800
And everything he's ever known and loved

1869
01:39:25,056 --> 01:39:26,848
Oh no I think I I think I

1870
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:27,872
I think I'm on this

1871
01:39:28,896 --> 01:39:29,664
I got his eyes

1872
01:39:37,344 --> 01:39:40,928
Constantinople intern

1873
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:43,232
But the guy whose ancestors

1874
01:39:43,488 --> 01:39:44,000
Chucktown

1875
01:39:44,768 --> 01:39:45,280
To Noble

1876
01:39:46,048 --> 01:39:48,352
History

1877
01:39:49,376 --> 01:39:51,680
He doesn't because it was taken over by people

1878
01:39:52,192 --> 01:39:53,728
Consistently throughout history

1879
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:55,520
Very strategically important

1880
01:40:07,296 --> 01:40:12,672
Christian

1881
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:14,464
Savannah

1882
01:40:15,232 --> 01:40:18,048
Break about the actual

1883
01:40:18,304 --> 01:40:19,072
Muslims

1884
01:40:19,328 --> 01:40:25,216
He's talking about here he goes on a lot of stuff about how they're named after people who were

1885
01:40:25,728 --> 01:40:27,520
Like involved in the Armenian Genocide

1886
01:40:28,032 --> 01:40:30,336
And stuff like that I don't want to unpack that

1887
01:40:30,592 --> 01:40:31,616
I don't I don't

1888
01:40:31,872 --> 01:40:34,176
Look I don't I'm not sitting here defending Jank

1889
01:40:34,688 --> 01:40:36,480
Not necessarily I don't know

1890
01:40:36,736 --> 01:40:40,576
Even talked about that thing about his right from when he was younger

1891
01:40:40,832 --> 01:40:42,368
Die except

1892
01:40:42,624 --> 01:40:44,416
Accept his apology I wasn't Wrong by

1893
01:40:44,672 --> 01:40:45,952
But is apology seems

1894
01:40:46,208 --> 01:40:47,744
Credible bit at same time

1895
01:40:48,256 --> 01:40:52,864
Not off the hook for that it seems very weird that he named his organization The Young Turks

1896
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:53,888
But you know what

1897
01:40:54,144 --> 01:40:56,192
Rod Stewart had a song called Young Turks

1898
01:40:56,704 --> 01:40:59,776
Young hearts be free

1899
01:41:00,032 --> 01:41:03,104
Now

1900
01:41:04,384 --> 01:41:07,968
Possible also another theory

1901
01:41:08,224 --> 01:41:10,272
Jackie Hubert named his channel

1902
01:41:10,528 --> 01:41:16,672
After a Rod Stewart song I don't know I get to the bottom of

1903
01:41:19,744 --> 01:41:22,560
It's only important because it feeds into this next

1904
01:41:23,584 --> 01:41:25,376
Very nice

1905
01:41:25,632 --> 01:41:29,472
Scary and concerning level of paranoia

1906
01:41:31,008 --> 01:41:34,080
I know you hate

1907
01:41:57,888 --> 01:41:58,912
Is that satire

1908
01:42:00,192 --> 01:42:01,984
I mean he was exhibiting the

1909
01:42:04,544 --> 01:42:06,080
Is that tire

1910
01:42:08,128 --> 01:42:10,688
You know what go back to Istanbul

1911
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:14,528
No that's racism

1912
01:42:14,784 --> 01:42:18,368
Do you know what I could actually you could make a case for that being said

1913
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:25,024
Because because he's very paranoid

1914
01:42:26,304 --> 01:42:27,072
Satirically

1915
01:42:28,352 --> 01:42:29,376
I'm going to I'm going to go with

1916
01:42:29,888 --> 01:42:30,400
You've got

1917
01:42:30,656 --> 01:42:36,032
I'm going to go with a maybe they'll hold on cuz

1918
01:42:36,288 --> 01:42:38,592
There's a level of fear and paranoia and he goes

1919
01:42:40,128 --> 01:42:46,272
You think I'm scared of you like always going to control

1920
01:42:46,528 --> 01:42:52,160
Yeah

1921
01:42:52,416 --> 01:42:54,976
The point that he's trying to make I'm not saying

1922
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:56,512
Satirical

1923
01:42:56,768 --> 01:42:57,280
I'm saying that

1924
01:42:57,536 --> 01:42:58,048
In a vacuum

1925
01:42:58,304 --> 01:42:59,328
I get that

1926
01:42:59,584 --> 01:43:00,608
But I'm saying

1927
01:43:00,864 --> 01:43:02,400
If we apply his

1928
01:43:02,656 --> 01:43:04,960
Belief about himself that he's using satire

1929
01:43:05,472 --> 01:43:07,520
Then the only conclusion come away from

1930
01:43:07,776 --> 01:43:09,312
That being satire

1931
01:43:09,824 --> 01:43:10,848
These Young Turks

1932
01:43:16,736 --> 01:43:20,064
Right but also we talked about there is when Jimmy Dore spit on it

1933
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:21,344
During all Young Turks

1934
01:43:26,464 --> 01:43:29,024
It was during the campaign and there was

1935
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:30,560
Maybe during one of the conventions

1936
01:43:30,816 --> 01:43:31,328
Something like that

1937
01:43:31,584 --> 01:43:33,632
And I all right

1938
01:43:35,424 --> 01:43:37,728
I think was horrible did he spit on Alex Jones but also

1939
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:40,800
I wouldn't I think

1940
01:43:41,056 --> 01:43:42,080
Now that does bordering

1941
01:43:42,336 --> 01:43:43,360
To assault territory

1942
01:43:44,128 --> 01:43:47,712
Anyway I don't support Jimmy Dore necessarily so I'm not going to

1943
01:43:47,968 --> 01:43:50,016
Other than Alex

1944
01:43:52,832 --> 01:43:55,392
You got to do better that with your screaming then

1945
01:43:55,648 --> 01:44:01,792
I was in control because that makes me think you're not now nor were you

1946
01:44:09,472 --> 01:44:12,288
What's the doodle Alex

1947
01:44:12,544 --> 01:44:13,056
Is talking

1948
01:44:13,312 --> 01:44:14,336
About

1949
01:44:14,592 --> 01:44:15,616
He kind of admit

1950
01:44:16,128 --> 01:44:16,896
2

1951
01:44:18,176 --> 01:44:18,688
Being

1952
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:19,712
Theatrical

1953
01:44:19,968 --> 01:44:20,992
Which

1954
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:22,784
But you also

1955
01:44:24,576 --> 01:44:25,600
I'll just tell you ahead of time

1956
01:44:25,856 --> 01:44:26,880
Keeps calling

1957
01:44:27,136 --> 01:44:27,904
Huger son

1958
01:44:28,672 --> 01:44:30,464
Weird twist

1959
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:31,488
For his verbiage

1960
01:44:31,744 --> 01:44:32,256
I don't

1961
01:44:32,512 --> 01:44:36,352
I don't like that I don't think it's necessarily like

1962
01:44:36,864 --> 01:44:40,448
Maybe not intentionally but again it goes back to like that is a that's

1963
01:44:40,704 --> 01:44:41,472
Free dog whistling

1964
01:44:41,728 --> 01:44:43,520
Yep cuz he doesn't usually call people son

1965
01:44:44,032 --> 01:44:46,080
Doesn't usually do that kind of

1966
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:50,944
Step away from boy

1967
01:44:55,808 --> 01:44:57,344
That's what I do son

1968
01:45:01,952 --> 01:45:04,000
You were just giving your stuff by Gulf States

1969
01:45:04,256 --> 01:45:05,024
Propped up

1970
01:45:05,792 --> 01:45:07,328
Google

1971
01:45:07,584 --> 01:45:10,144
Successful

1972
01:45:13,216 --> 01:45:17,568
Also just for fun sounds

1973
01:45:17,824 --> 01:45:21,664
Archive page of infowars.com

1974
01:45:22,176 --> 01:45:23,456
1899 or 98

1975
01:45:23,968 --> 01:45:25,760
And someone else

1976
01:45:26,016 --> 01:45:27,296
Austin Austin

1977
01:45:27,552 --> 01:45:31,904
So even I don't even know even that is kind of

1978
01:45:32,416 --> 01:45:34,464
Very difficult to dig that up at this point

1979
01:45:38,304 --> 01:45:40,608
You don't you don't understand running around

1980
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:42,912
You understand

1981
01:45:43,424 --> 01:45:45,984
Avinash collaborate for Sora

1982
01:45:46,496 --> 01:45:47,008
Oh

1983
01:45:51,104 --> 01:45:51,872
I don't know

1984
01:45:52,384 --> 01:45:54,176
I don't know I don't really care

1985
01:45:54,432 --> 01:45:57,760
Anymore he's not self-made this is all such nonsense

1986
01:46:01,344 --> 01:46:02,624
The next one

1987
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:05,696
Allergies is a serious straw man

1988
01:46:08,256 --> 01:46:09,024
What drug is it

1989
01:46:09,536 --> 01:46:10,816
On the actual clip

1990
01:46:11,072 --> 01:46:12,096
Alex watch the whole thing

1991
01:46:12,608 --> 01:46:13,888
He knows that eventually drink

1992
01:46:14,144 --> 01:46:14,912
Brings up Ludlow

1993
01:46:15,424 --> 01:46:16,704
Any brings up how

1994
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:18,240
All of the things that Alex's

1995
01:46:18,496 --> 01:46:21,824
Using all these deceitful betrayer backstabber

1996
01:46:22,336 --> 01:46:24,128
These are also have historical characterization

1997
01:46:24,896 --> 01:46:26,944
Yes and it's not coincidental that

1998
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:28,992
Most of the rant was appearance

1999
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:30,528
And so

2000
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:31,552
On that

2001
01:46:32,064 --> 01:46:34,880
Side I think it a pretty decent job

2002
01:46:35,136 --> 01:46:38,976
Tossing out what was going on

2003
01:46:39,232 --> 01:46:39,744
In terms of

2004
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:41,024
I got off track on

2005
01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:44,352
Some of their assessment like Alex calls them broke back

2006
01:46:44,608 --> 01:46:49,984
And they're like that means calling them gay

2007
01:46:50,240 --> 01:46:51,776
Taking things in the proper context

2008
01:46:52,288 --> 01:46:55,872
But they do decent job of that like I said he brings up the blood libel

2009
01:46:56,128 --> 01:46:57,408
The least is a nice

2010
01:46:57,920 --> 01:46:59,712
Start Alex has to know that that's

2011
01:46:59,968 --> 01:47:00,480
Coming up events

2012
01:47:01,248 --> 01:47:01,760
And so he cuts off

2013
01:47:02,016 --> 01:47:02,784
The clip

2014
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:04,320
Strawman

2015
01:47:08,416 --> 01:47:09,440
Those guys

2016
01:47:17,376 --> 01:47:18,400
You seen in history

2017
01:47:23,264 --> 01:47:28,896
Oh my gosh

2018
01:47:40,416 --> 01:47:42,720
Free shipping is coming up

2019
01:47:48,864 --> 01:47:51,168
What's fascinating about it though to is that like

2020
01:47:51,424 --> 01:47:53,472
What he's doing is he's allowing Jank to

2021
01:47:53,728 --> 01:47:54,240
To save that

2022
01:47:54,752 --> 01:47:58,592
But not to explain what do you mean

2023
01:47:58,848 --> 01:47:59,616
Just bring up

2024
01:47:59,872 --> 01:48:01,408
These historical characterization

2025
01:48:01,664 --> 01:48:04,992
So he's allowed this sound bites

2026
01:48:05,248 --> 01:48:06,528
To be a mischaracterization

2027
01:48:06,784 --> 01:48:07,808
Ogle Jenkins

2028
01:48:08,064 --> 01:48:08,832
And then he just like

2029
01:48:11,648 --> 01:48:15,232
They think Alex is laughing the soffits

2030
01:48:15,744 --> 01:48:17,536
Weather

2031
01:48:17,792 --> 01:48:18,560
Explain what Alec

2032
01:48:21,632 --> 01:48:22,400
Is more aware of this than I

2033
01:48:23,168 --> 01:48:23,680
We pick

2034
01:48:24,192 --> 01:48:25,216
I think he might be

2035
01:48:25,472 --> 01:48:26,496
Pretty well aware

2036
01:48:26,752 --> 01:48:28,032
That most of his rhetoric has

2037
01:48:28,544 --> 01:48:30,080
A very much

2038
01:48:30,848 --> 01:48:33,664
I think that for a long time we've been

2039
01:48:34,432 --> 01:48:35,456
Giving a pass

2040
01:48:35,712 --> 01:48:36,992
To like the it being

2041
01:48:37,248 --> 01:48:39,296
He's oblivious to the history of the narratives

2042
01:48:39,552 --> 01:48:42,368
He's spitting but I am not sure we can give him that pass

2043
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:43,904
Well I don't know

2044
01:48:44,160 --> 01:48:45,952
Regardless of that at the very least

2045
01:48:46,208 --> 01:48:47,232
He's aware of

2046
01:48:47,744 --> 01:48:49,280
How damaging it would be

2047
01:48:49,536 --> 01:48:50,304
To have those

2048
01:48:51,072 --> 01:48:51,584
Play Don Ho

2049
01:48:52,096 --> 01:48:52,608
Show

2050
01:48:52,864 --> 01:48:54,144
Certainly

2051
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:56,192
Really come up with a rebuttal

2052
01:48:56,448 --> 01:48:56,960
To that like if

2053
01:48:57,216 --> 01:49:03,360
If he played it on his own show

2054
01:49:04,640 --> 01:49:05,664
It's difficult

2055
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:07,200
To be like a pecan

2056
01:49:07,712 --> 01:49:08,992
Really wrestle with the ID

2057
01:49:09,248 --> 01:49:09,760
Idea that

2058
01:49:11,040 --> 01:49:12,576
Why do you think these people

2059
01:49:13,856 --> 01:49:16,672
Prove that

2060
01:49:16,928 --> 01:49:18,464
What do you have that proves that

2061
01:49:19,232 --> 01:49:21,024
And the only thing he could point to is

2062
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:22,048
Conspiracy sites

2063
01:49:22,304 --> 01:49:26,144
That all are informed by the arcade

2064
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:28,448
So that's the only thing he could go on

2065
01:49:28,704 --> 01:49:30,240
He can't wrestle with that passed

2066
01:49:31,776 --> 01:49:32,800
That's not a good defense

2067
01:49:33,312 --> 01:49:34,848
I know they drink blood

2068
01:49:35,104 --> 01:49:39,200
Listen to these anti-semites over here tell

2069
01:49:39,456 --> 01:49:44,320
Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater

2070
01:49:44,576 --> 01:49:46,880
Book broken anti-semites can be right twice

2071
01:49:47,136 --> 01:49:49,696
I'm sure there will be some sort of rationalization

2072
01:49:49,952 --> 01:49:52,000
Here's the last clip and I think it's a

2073
01:49:52,512 --> 01:49:53,536
Wraparound

2074
01:49:54,048 --> 01:49:54,816
Is all of this horseshit

2075
01:49:56,096 --> 01:49:57,376
Free shipping

2076
01:50:00,448 --> 01:50:01,728
The future

2077
01:50:04,288 --> 01:50:05,312
If we simply

2078
01:50:05,568 --> 01:50:06,848
Embrace God's plan

2079
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:13,504
And be good decent honorable people adopt me going to church and telling people

2080
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:14,272
Richard Gere

2081
01:50:14,528 --> 01:50:17,344
Not being a scumbag

2082
01:50:18,112 --> 01:50:23,232
And not being jealous of people for no reason

2083
01:50:28,864 --> 01:50:30,912
Of the sinking Yung turd

2084
01:50:33,472 --> 01:50:33,984
System

2085
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:37,312
They're falling

2086
01:50:45,248 --> 01:50:50,112
Because we carry the light in the darkness of the night and we're willing to execute and not give up

2087
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:53,696
And not giving up and not falter and not waver at not

2088
01:50:54,976 --> 01:50:55,488
Tower

2089
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:59,584
So he's presenting Infowars as a victim their butt

2090
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:00,608
The other thing is

2091
01:51:01,888 --> 01:51:02,656
Yeah most

2092
01:51:02,912 --> 01:51:04,192
News organizations aren't

2093
01:51:04,448 --> 01:51:05,728
Being investigated in

2094
01:51:05,984 --> 01:51:07,264
Put it under the microscope

2095
01:51:07,520 --> 01:51:08,032
Because most

2096
01:51:08,288 --> 01:51:08,800
Aren't

2097
01:51:09,312 --> 01:51:09,824
Committing

2098
01:51:10,592 --> 01:51:13,152
Well they even cry Prime decide they aren't just

2099
01:51:13,408 --> 01:51:13,920
Spouting

2100
01:51:14,432 --> 01:51:14,944
Consistent

2101
01:51:15,712 --> 01:51:17,504
Atria like there's no other way to tie

2102
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:18,272
Take so much of

2103
01:51:18,528 --> 01:51:19,040
The stuff he says

2104
01:51:19,808 --> 01:51:23,392
It's all white identity all white victimhood all-male for

2105
01:51:23,648 --> 01:51:24,160
Fragility

2106
01:51:24,416 --> 01:51:25,184
All the all the

2107
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:26,464
That is underneath

2108
01:51:28,768 --> 01:51:30,048
Those things

2109
01:51:31,072 --> 01:51:33,632
People care what you say Alex

2110
01:51:34,144 --> 01:51:35,680
Marcus anyone thinks you're right

2111
01:51:36,192 --> 01:51:37,728
Don't even think you're right or bigots

2112
01:51:37,984 --> 01:51:38,496
I love the

2113
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:40,032
I mean I think

2114
01:51:40,288 --> 01:51:41,312
He is telling the truth when

2115
01:51:41,568 --> 01:51:42,080
He says he tries

2116
01:51:42,848 --> 01:51:43,360
People the way he want

2117
01:51:45,408 --> 01:51:47,712
Yeah okay I think I think he does

2118
01:51:47,968 --> 01:51:48,480
Like I think

2119
01:51:49,248 --> 01:51:51,040
Genuinely feels like this is

2120
01:51:51,296 --> 01:51:52,320
How he deserves

2121
01:51:52,576 --> 01:51:58,720
Oh yeah that's possible what are those pdsa

2122
01:51:59,488 --> 01:52:00,512
He's definitely got like a

2123
01:52:01,024 --> 01:52:02,816
No this is how you communicate love

2124
01:52:03,328 --> 01:52:09,472
Cuz I forgot to play the out-of-context drop from earlier

2125
01:52:09,728 --> 01:52:11,008
I want to play a

2126
01:52:11,264 --> 01:52:13,312
Because I think it really sums up why people

2127
01:52:13,824 --> 01:52:14,336
Student

2128
01:52:17,408 --> 01:52:19,200
Casually address Alex Jones

2129
01:52:19,968 --> 01:52:20,480
Like

2130
01:52:20,736 --> 01:52:25,088
I think you need to know what he's talking about in order to have a conversation about him or else

2131
01:52:25,344 --> 01:52:26,624
You're going to fall into his trap

2132
01:52:27,392 --> 01:52:30,720
This is from a commercially plays on the show where he and Rodger Stone go shooting

2133
01:52:31,744 --> 01:52:32,768
Until they're shooting a bunch of gun

2134
01:52:33,792 --> 01:52:34,304
And

2135
01:52:39,424 --> 01:52:40,192
That sums it up

2136
01:52:40,448 --> 01:52:43,520
Great is really excited about the idea that him want to trigger lips

2137
01:52:43,776 --> 01:52:46,592
Rodger Stone charged with guns

2138
01:52:47,104 --> 01:52:50,432
And in that which is great but when he gets triggered

2139
01:52:57,856 --> 01:52:59,648
Muslim for criticizing about it

2140
01:53:00,160 --> 01:53:00,672
