1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:02,304
Holding

2
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alex

3
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:13,824
We're couple dudes like to sit around and drink wine

4
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:19,712
Pacific

5
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:21,760
Never again

6
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:23,552
Odd Squad Elie Wiesel

7
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:33,536
Cancel it

8
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:41,216
Sucralose drinking white wine before you got here that's why that opening was so off the rails

9
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:46,080
I really consider and drink red wine

10
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,528
Do

11
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,320
What would be more interest

12
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:57,600
Two guys

13
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:59,904
You both know a lot about Alex Jones

14
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:01,696
Have a back-and-forth

15
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:04,000
Know already know

16
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:07,328
There is no that would be not interested

17
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:09,888
I'm listening

18
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:13,984
I like a second option

19
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,264
Or one of us

20
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:17,056
It doesn't really matter which way

21
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:22,944
Probably the guy with the deep and comforting verito

22
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:24,992
What if he knew a lot

23
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:27,296
But are our co-host

24
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:29,344
Man he doesn't know nothing

25
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,184
I think that I would only work if the co-host was

26
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,488
Shocked by everything and screamed a lot

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,816
That would work

28
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:45,216
Joy Andrade

29
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:49,056
We've already spent 25 minutes on our in

30
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:55,456
Oh boy episode

31
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:56,224
Alex Jones

32
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,272
But today is going to be slightly different

33
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:00,064
And we'll get to that in a minute

34
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,600
But before we do

35
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,880
I want to play

36
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:04,672
Something from

37
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:06,464
Monday's episode

38
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:07,488
That isn't

39
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:09,024
Incredibly important

40
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,840
There is no joking around about that

41
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:15,936
God damn this is super super duper series

42
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:17,728
This is from Monday

43
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:20,032
May 1st episode

44
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:22,592
Alex Jones having an interview with Steve pieczenik

45
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:24,128
Now

46
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:26,944
For reasons that are completely unknown to me

47
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,224
Is in front of

48
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,808
What appears to be a diagram of all the genres of hip-hop

49
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,880
I will post a picture on Twitter no

50
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:41,280
What what else would Steve pieczenik be diagramming the man of the counter-coup

51
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,048
He is

52
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,144
Military strategist psychologist for the CIA in the past

53
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,704
In front of a board of trap

54
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:49,728
Crunk

55
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,264
Turntablism

56
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,312
I've no idea what's going on okay

57
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:55,616
That is irrelevant

58
00:02:57,408 --> 00:03:02,016
Either he wandered into the writers room and VH1 in 1994

59
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:02,784
Kobe

60
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,344
A bedroom

61
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:06,880
Or

62
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,160
He is

63
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,208
Diagramming that

64
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:14,048
Hoover and 7th

65
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:17,376
I could give a very simple explanation I think might be right

66
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,912
I hope it's

67
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,240
They have all these berries about how hip-hop was made to lie

68
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:26,592
Popularize criminality in the black community and stuff like that

69
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:28,128
I could see it being something like that

70
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,920
But even

71
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:30,688
While

72
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:34,784
While but he's sitting in front of this chart

73
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,136
But I think

74
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:42,464
He's going to very seriously regret saying

75
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,792
Oh he is got so many different things to regret

76
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,400
I miss my dog knock

77
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:54,240
Safeway at the bottom

78
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:04,224
I'm going to kick your ass Adam Schiff you pack a pussies feel your hand

79
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:09,088
I was just up

80
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,952
But then you've got the guy who owns Chobani is importing rapist

81
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,000
I think this one's higher

82
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:20,607
Holy now it might not be legally actionable but I think you're going to regret this

83
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,655
Some good news

84
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:25,983
I don't want to get them obviously

85
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,519
But let's just say this

86
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:33,151
I know Mike cernovich the sources the government does his sources social

87
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:37,503
But it's obviously who's been retweeting him and saying he's a great guy between our stuff

88
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,575
Very close to president

89
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:47,999
Tell it's not a secret it's his son especially Donald Junior is a total Patriots and there's a bunch of other people so Trump is for

90
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,679
That wasn't a secret

91
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:06,943
I'll tell you it's not a secret government apparently

92
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:14,623
That's why this is a huge f****** problem

93
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,927
Whether it's true or not

94
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,463
Illegals

95
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:24,863
All of the illegal things that you can do well here's the part that's even more f***** up is it barely plays on All

96
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:27,423
Audio clip

97
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:29,983
Steve pieczenik responses right

98
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,519
He agrees

99
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,615
Kids are the sources

100
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,151
For Mike cernovich

101
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,967
Field propaganda article

102
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,527
Now there's two things that are going on here

103
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,087
Okay there's two pads

104
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:51,487
That are possible and one of them also

105
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:52,511
Path of this

106
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:54,047
Alex telling the truth

107
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:56,095
Here and if you telling the truth

108
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,119
Superfecta

109
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:02,751
If he's if he's not telling the truth and he's just making this up out of whole cloth

110
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,079
Like Donald Trump is never going to talk to him again

111
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:08,127
Any sources that he does have

112
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:14,527
He's burnt no sources should ever

113
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:20,927
Talk to clear most of his sources are fake

114
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:23,231
Fuel sources going to hear that and be like I don't know if I can

115
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:24,511
Can trust his discretion

116
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:28,095
His confidentiality means nothing he just on air

117
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:34,751
The children of the sitting president information to a right

118
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:38,079
Which information

119
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:44,479
Angelique witch again.

120
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,015
Telling the truth

121
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,551
Birds

122
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,135
Rights because now sirovich is sources out in

123
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:54,719
Trump's kids are never going to be giving him information ever again

124
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:56,511
You would hope

125
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:01,631
You are forgetting

126
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,167
Stupidity of all of the

127
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,447
People

128
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,471
That's a fair point

129
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:09,823
But this is one of the most f*****-up things I've heard on the show and I've listened to a lot of it

130
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,895
I don't think I've ever

131
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:15,967
Like fully witnessed someone out

132
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:16,991
A source

133
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:20,063
Like I've never seen a journalist do it in real time

134
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:24,415
So flippantly

135
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:32,863
Donald Trump jr. jr.

136
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,143
Bananas

137
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:37,471
For someone who claims to

138
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:44,383
It's it's right now I'll tell you what it's picked up on like Reddit

139
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:47,711
Picture

140
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,015
Screenshot from the Donald

141
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:55,135
God dammit now started getting more stories

142
00:07:55,391 --> 00:08:01,535
We just kind of fairs

143
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:07,167
Think of the war games what happens when you burn a source but we've already established

144
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:07,935
If it's not

145
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:11,007
No he's losing it

146
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,567
But since losing it in the prison

147
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:15,871
Maybe it's time

148
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:16,895
For us to escape

149
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,455
Time for us

150
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:22,527
To take a little trip down memory lane but before we do that

151
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:24,575
Need to do a little shout-out

152
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:28,159
Like to thank our man out in Germany what's up Ian

153
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:36,607
Thank you John and

154
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,631
Supporter

155
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:41,727
Is it

156
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:45,055
He took us up on our offer is more what I should say

157
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:50,175
We offered on our last episode that if people donated $10 a month or more

158
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,711
That's a wee word

159
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:53,247
Take a day in history

160
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:57,599
Go back to what Alex Jones was doing on that day

161
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:03,231
So me a couple days is that the first date exactly was the date of the first

162
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:07,583
Nuclear test by South Korea North Korea

163
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,375
Which was in 2006

164
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:14,751
Turn on fortunately my archives don't go back that far so I could not find that episode

165
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,031
SAS for a backup

166
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:16,799
Date

167
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,335
You sent me

168
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,615
June 4th

169
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,407
2015

170
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,711
What was June 4th 2005

171
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:26,015
What do you think's going on

172
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:29,087
You're a man of letters

173
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:36,767
2015

174
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:40,607
June 4th

175
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,655
Ernest anyway

176
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:46,239
Did we blow something we didn't

177
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,519
Let me see if

178
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,311
Out of context

179
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,335
From June

180
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,103
20

181
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:54,687
This is June

182
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,711
2015

183
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:02,879
Haven't been convinced there's as being right all the time

184
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:05,439
It was one day marriage

185
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:08,255
Bypassing the Supreme Court

186
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:11,583
Well

187
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:17,471
That's what was expected when Ian made this suggestion

188
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:18,495
Here's the deal

189
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:21,823
The actual Court decision was on the 26th

190
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:26,175
Unfortunately Alex name of the 25th

191
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:30,271
Alex Jones is in studio on the 24th

192
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:34,879
He doesn't talk about the gay marriage Supreme Court case at all

193
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:45,375
Maybe he doesn't talk about it on the 24th so I'm like that's not fair the subject matter that was requested

194
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,167
Quested was the Supreme Court case

195
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,215
I want to go to the next day

196
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,775
On the 25th when the court

197
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:55,615
Alex Jones is in Michigan

198
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:57,151
For his cousin's wedding

199
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:02,527
David Knight isn't studio and he's mad

200
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,671
So I'm like alright

201
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:12,255
Sunday episode Alexandra back to Friday

202
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,303
28

203
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:15,327
Going down

204
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:16,863
Nope

205
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:17,631
Nothing

206
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:18,911
Get nothing from him

207
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,471
David Knight still in studio

208
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,519
So we have to go

209
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:27,103
To the next episode where Alex Jones is actually on

210
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:30,943
2015

211
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,735
Now you might be asking yourself

212
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,527
Does he go ape shitt

213
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,063
About gay marriage

214
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,855
I wouldn't so here's my

215
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,391
He does not go ape

216
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:42,463
He spends all of his time

217
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:45,535
Trying to straddle the line between like

218
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,935
But at the same time

219
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:54,751
I just think that

220
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:06,015
I think it's pretty reasonable

221
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,807
Yeah let's find out

222
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,855
Here's the first clip from the show

223
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:11,135
This is

224
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:13,183
A little Special Report

225
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:17,535
But Alex throws it to Special Report

226
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,887
And you're going to witness

227
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,935
Like right out of the gate

228
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,471
Minute one

229
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,263
The Alex Jones Show

230
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,823
From June 29th 2015

231
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:32,895
Something that is out of bounds

232
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:38,015
Hello explain when we get back

233
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:44,927
American flag

234
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,719
Now we'll get back to that

235
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:52,607
If it's going to come back

236
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:54,399
Butts

237
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:57,983
And it's no joke

238
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:02,335
Obviously called last week

239
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:08,991
Which is not a reasonable 100

240
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:12,575
Collapse

241
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:22,047
Front and so much more

242
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:25,119
Very important broadcast news on Isis

243
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,215
Really

244
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:32,799
For four years

245
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:39,455
I'll be so-called Rebels

246
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:42,015
Comes out August 2nd Amendment

247
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:48,415
Infowars.com now this week the Pope

248
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:50,207
Decided to go full retard

249
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:54,559
When he released a statement saying the gun manufacturers are not Christians

250
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:58,655
Oh I find that extremely funny to hear that coming from the Pope

251
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:02,751
Because here infowars.com we do have a Christian owned

252
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:05,823
Gun manufacturer as a sponsor

253
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:12,479
And co-founder releases statement

254
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:16,831
By the fact

255
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:21,951
Mmm saying bad things about the pope isn't really what is out of bounds

256
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:26,303
I do think it's funny to think that the pope who is an Italy is bound by the

257
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:28,607
Second Amendment I think that's absurd

258
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:35,007
But the thing that's way

259
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:39,871
Is the idea that Joe Biggs made it special report

260
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:41,407
The cookout the Pope

261
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,455
On behalf of a sponsor

262
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:50,367
I was I was a little bit more concerned about the reference

263
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:54,719
224r

264
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:01,887
Is Waters Downey jr.

265
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:07,775
Thunderbird

266
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:10,335
That was the problem

267
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:12,639
I don't appreciate

268
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,687
Majority of Manor.

269
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:18,527
Is that

270
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:20,831
It is exploited

271
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:25,695
Sew-ins

272
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,975
You did it again

273
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:29,023
Want to go to a

274
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,559
A restaurant called

275
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:35,423
Build it we're going to do that another idea

276
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:39,775
Noh8

277
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,335
The joke is that actor Zara

278
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:44,639
Voiding that in order to get

279
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,663
Yeah

280
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,271
In order to

281
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:51,551
Revealed

282
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:52,575
Hypocrisy

283
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,343
Stupidity

284
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:59,999
He's trying to use it

285
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,791
Min away

286
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,327
Also

287
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,911
If you're a Christian owned

288
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:11,519
Gun manufacturer

289
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:16,383
No Pope head

290
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:22,015
Wow I don't I don't know what that means

291
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,551
I'm so

292
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:28,415
The pope gave a speech that they're talking about some quotes from it

293
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,439
If you only trust

294
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,463
Man

295
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,231
You have lost

296
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:35,327
You told the young people in a long rambling talk about war Trust

297
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,863
In politics after putting aside

298
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,399
His prepared address

299
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:44,799
It makes me think of people managers businessman who call themselves Christian and they manufacture weapons

300
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,383
He's right on it man

301
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,943
That leads to a bit of a distrust doesn't it

302
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,479
He said to Applause

303
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:56,319
He also criticized those who invested weapons Industries

304
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:58,623
Quote duplicity is the currency of today

305
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:00,415
They say one thing and do another

306
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:04,255
I think a pretty fair assessment

307
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,279
Yeah it's

308
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:09,631
Cool Pope globalist

309
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,167
Yeah so I mean like

310
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:14,239
Out of context

311
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:18,335
I'll be half of your sponsor you're basically starting the show with an ad where you're committing

312
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,639
It's not God

313
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:21,919
No

314
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,479
You're just pissing on the Pope

315
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,503
4ad

316
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:27,551
Yeah that's awesome

317
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:29,599
That's one of my favorite things about

318
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,463
Mainstream Christians are

319
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,487
Mad at the Pope

320
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:37,279
Every now and again and then

321
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:39,583
Super happy with him

322
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,119
The cognitive dissonance

323
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:43,679
Of religion

324
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:45,727
Certainly

325
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:46,751
The

326
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,055
You can take that

327
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,335
Barely an Oculus

328
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,383
Hey if you're investing

329
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:53,919
Gunther used

330
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:55,967
So you're investing

331
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:58,271
You're profiting off the

332
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:03,135
That's what you doing I mean if you really get down to it

333
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:07,999
Joe Biggs goes on to be like you know how people use weapons to use guns to hunt

334
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:14,399
Feed their families Amato's money if it's made from

335
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:15,935
Killing industry it's

336
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:17,215
Staggering I guess

337
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,007
It's almost nothing comparatively

338
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:21,311
So when you want if you want to make that argument

339
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,103
Please debate the pope Joe Biggs

340
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:25,663
Go back and have a conversation with him about your

341
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,199
Principal Gunn stamp

342
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:30,271
Franklin

343
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,063
I don't even think Jason Biggs

344
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:36,927
Basically gone now

345
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:39,743
In modern-day already

346
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:43,071
So I'm going to break it down for you

347
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:48,191
Break it down this episode of 2015 is globalist heavy

348
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:49,983
Good

349
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:52,543
I'm looking forward to it

350
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,567
Classic

351
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:59,711
I don't know how wacky it is

352
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:03,295
If it's on advised at certain points certainly

353
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:05,855
The main narrative that runs throughout

354
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:08,159
Basically this entire episode

355
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:08,927
Is Greece

356
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,975
Degrees financial crisis

357
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:11,743
What was going on in

358
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:15,071
You mean the one caused by

359
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:16,095
Banks

360
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:16,863
6

361
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:17,631
There

362
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:18,399
Nanami and

363
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,471
Forcing them to accept

364
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,263
Steriti measures for

365
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,031
Zaire

366
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:29,407
And you have just made the globalist argument

367
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:34,527
Or at least you might believe in the global

368
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:37,855
Yeah but hit me up saying big Banks

369
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,415
His work

370
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:45,279
His version of it is far more Sinister than just capitalism out of control

371
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:47,839
Hillsboro

372
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:49,631
This first clip

373
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:50,655
Goodyear

374
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:52,959
Now that we're out of the advertisement section

375
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:55,775
Globalist

376
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,823
Are trying to

377
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:01,663
Architect will take up most of

378
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:06,015
He's just trying to sell out how evil the globalist

379
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:07,295
Now we know the

380
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:08,063
The origin of

381
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:15,743
Could be this is just about how global history volando trying

382
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:16,511
To change this

383
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,583
They've taken over almost

384
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:28,287
Real Drilling in

385
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:38,783
Announcement

386
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,831
To move the Overton window

387
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:51,583
Coins middle of the last century

388
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:10,271
They're slightly out of the Overton window

389
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:13,343
I think he is just described himself

390
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:16,672
That's exactly what he just did right there is nothing

391
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:17,952
In the world

392
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,744
That is more pushing what is

393
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,560
Decent

394
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:24,608
He is so like

395
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:27,168
Because he is so crazy the ID

396
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:27,936
DIA

397
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:33,824
Taking everybody's Healthcare away

398
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:35,360
Is though that's giving

399
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,064
Individual

400
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:45,088
And then

401
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:52,000
Listen

402
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:54,816
I think that just kind of

403
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:55,584
Subconscious

404
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:59,424
What would also is like

405
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:03,776
It's on air all day and is like Hillary Clinton is literally a demon

406
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:10,176
Like if you want to talk about pushing discourse in a certain direction you've introduced the idea of the demons are real

407
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:12,480
Influence our politicians

408
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:16,576
Now before you introduce this idea into our discourse

409
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:22,976
We just have to talk about ideas and disagreeing with them thrown out the window and now anybody could be possessed

410
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:29,888
So that your Overton window is way over here over here

411
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:32,192
Demonize your opponent when you just go

412
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:32,960
Literal with

413
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:33,728
With demon eyes

414
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:39,360
Smells like fire and f******

415
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:44,224
Brimstone never noticed that a fly landed on Obama flies Neverland on people

416
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:45,504
Anyway

417
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:46,528
Alex

418
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:47,808
As an example

419
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:49,088
Of them pushing

420
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:50,368
The Overton window

421
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:55,488
That I think is last relevant than him

422
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:57,792
In terms of actually doing it

423
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:58,816
Okay we'll see

424
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:01,888
What they're doing

425
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:04,960
Because their Vanguard is so far out

426
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:07,520
Jocelyn elders

427
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,152
3 years ago as a Surgeon General

428
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,992
Calling for the school to

429
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:18,528
Help children

430
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:20,576
Ages 5 masturbate

431
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:32,864
I don't know how to masturbate

432
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:35,424
I want

433
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:39,008
That's pretty good

434
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:44,384
We need we need schools to help five-year-old masturbate

435
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:50,784
For those young'uns out there you know where to round Jocelyn elders

436
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,832
Was the Surgeon General

437
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:53,600
The Clinton years

438
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:55,904
Prove it that you got fired after

439
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,208
She

440
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:02,560
Speak at the United Nations conference on AIDS

441
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:06,400
She was asked by someone there whether the appropriate

442
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:08,192
To promote masturbation is a means

443
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:12,800
Preventing young people from engaging in riskier forms of sexual activity

444
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:14,336
Aren't you replying quote

445
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:16,384
I think that it is part of

446
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,456
Human sexuality and perhaps it should be taught

447
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:20,992
That's it

448
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:22,528
I don't think that's

449
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:25,344
Genuinely do not see an egg

450
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:30,720
I honestly even before I was ten I did not see the controversial

451
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:38,144
I don't think I don't think my parents that is controversial I don't think there's anything Overton window we about it

452
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,496
Now the only things you can take away from that is that Alex Jones does not

453
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:43,264
I think that people should

454
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:45,056
Possibly

455
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:49,408
Hey neither does Jocelyn elders

456
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,712
That's not what you said

457
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:58,112
I didn't I wasn't in you at the UN when I was 10

458
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:58,880
Wanted people to

459
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:00,928
Something they've been doing

460
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:04,768
White Horse Tavern

461
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:05,792
Brevard

462
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:07,072
About the firing

463
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:12,960
The areas where the president does not agree with her views this is just one too many

464
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:18,080
Is 12 me

465
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:20,896
They did not see internet pouring

466
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:22,944
No f******

467
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,480
Or the next few years

468
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:26,528
Clinton's life

469
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:28,576
You didn't masturbate

470
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:29,600
Fair enough

471
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:32,160
He is already

472
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:33,696
Two clips

473
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:36,768
Which again is maybe within the first couple minutes of the show

474
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:40,864
Completely misrepresented with the Pope said in order to plug one of his pain

475
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:42,912
And completely

476
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:49,312
We completely misrepresented something to Jocelyn Elders said 1e f****** years ago in order to make his argument

477
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:52,896
About the Overton window

478
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:55,712
Example

479
00:25:56,736 --> 00:26:00,064
23 years ago as Surgeon General said maybe if

480
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,368
People masturbated in that was okay

481
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,904
They would be less likely to come

482
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:06,720
That's not even what you was talkin about

483
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:10,048
She was

484
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:16,448
Kids young people engaging in Risky forms of sexual activity unprotected

485
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,728
Like that

486
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:20,288
Avoiding diseases

487
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,056
Watch it like that

488
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,592
If you masturbate

489
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:23,616
Safe

490
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:25,408
That sort of thing

491
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:26,944
Depends on where you are

492
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:30,528
Put her in the car at a friend's get in trouble

493
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:36,928
Cafe

494
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:40,256
Perhaps response was even

495
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,280
Perhaps

496
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:42,304
It should be taught

497
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:44,608
Yeah it's not even saying

498
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:46,400
I think this should be

499
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:48,192
Maybe

500
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:53,056
Banana

501
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:55,872
That banana

502
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:56,896
Less likely to

503
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:57,920
2

504
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:59,968
Ashamed and miserable ever

505
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:03,552
Hey this is okay

506
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:05,600
It's normal human behavior that

507
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:06,624
Everybody does

508
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,672
Like have you ever gone to the zoo

509
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,976
Sea-Monkey master

510
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:15,072
Kind of Cults that we grew up in

511
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:17,120
I'm so the next

512
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:18,400
Monkeys don't teach each other

513
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:21,472
Perhaps he's wrong

514
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:24,800
Yeah but they mature fat

515
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:29,408
Is Alex just blowing hard

516
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:30,944
Just blowing hard

517
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:32,480
Just I

518
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:33,504
The best

519
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:37,856
How old is he

520
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:38,624
So

521
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:40,928
How is Alex Jones

522
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:41,952
Never wrong

523
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:42,976
Donald Trump

524
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:47,584
How do I continue

525
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:52,192
Weekend

526
00:27:56,288 --> 00:28:02,432
Because they told us what they're going to do and they done it over and over again world and old world

527
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,648
Apologist and sociologists

528
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:17,792
Launch file

529
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,936
We have accessed them

530
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,056
You would think it's a weakness that they're so predictable

531
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:30,336
Their responses hey

532
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:31,872
The public is even conscious

533
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:34,688
If you're awake if you're aware

534
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:40,576
Person that is for children

535
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:45,952
Who Coronavirus

536
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:48,256
I don't even know what you're talkin about

537
00:28:56,704 --> 00:29:00,800
I just kept that to a positive review the long side at the end

538
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:03,360
I'm just grabbing things that are important to note are

539
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:07,456
One of them is that does not speaking a specifics

540
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:09,248
Information

541
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:11,552
Just proclaimed that he's always right

542
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:13,856
But if you really look into it he's wrong about almost every

543
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:16,160
He's absolutely just is

544
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:17,696
Is fax or Shawty

545
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:20,512
Value depends assertion that he never backs up ever

546
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:22,304
So much documentation

547
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,096
He's predicted that he's wrong about

548
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:25,376
But the other thing

549
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:28,192
Is this a beauty comes to the end or is like

550
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,728
Everyone's dumb

551
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,520
And you can't even communicate

552
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:34,336
Others there's two things I want to

553
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:35,616
Speculate about their

554
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:36,640
1

555
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:39,456
Is that because he has a very specific mental illness

556
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:41,504
She can't talk to other people

557
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,064
CiCi's crazy

558
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:49,696
Whenever anyone else talking to him he can't communicate because he just starts rambling about globalist

559
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:51,232
National forces

560
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:53,792
References to documents

561
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:56,864
Scientist who may or may not have talked to

562
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,192
And I can't follow you

563
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:03,008
Even the most generous of interviewer he's going to yell at them

564
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,848
It's impossible for him to interact with anybody on a human level

565
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:09,664
I seen him with his co-host

566
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,688
Mildly abusive

567
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:13,504
So I think there's some of that he's projecting

568
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:14,528
A little bit

569
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,832
And then beyond that

570
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:18,624
That is also

571
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:22,464
A mentality that is a spouse in the protocols of the elders

572
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,536
This idea that most of the masses are dumb

573
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:26,816
And the globalist

574
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:28,608
Are trying to make them dumb

575
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:29,888
In order to make them Ali-A

576
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,192
Well it also

577
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,288
Only trust your

578
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:37,056
Leader

579
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:37,824
To be the one who

580
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:39,616
The truth

581
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:40,896
That forces you to

582
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:41,920
To put everybody else

583
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:43,456
True

584
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:44,480
So he is

585
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:46,528
He is isolating his listeners

586
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:49,344
Yes

587
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,184
Yeah well he's isolated from everybody else they can only have him

588
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,720
Exact as a conduit the truth

589
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:57,024
Yeah yeah that is true

590
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:58,048
At the bomber

591
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,328
But the good news is

592
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,096
What's a good news

593
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:01,376
Albertsons off of special

594
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:02,144
Boston a bunch of thing

595
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:03,424
Alakazam

596
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,472
On certain matters

597
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:06,496
Especially

598
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:07,776
Isis

599
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:14,432
Show big specialist on Isis is going to walk you through

600
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:16,224
How evil Muslims are in

601
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:19,808
Home

602
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:22,368
It starts with ISIS

603
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:28,768
Generalized is the first of two times

604
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:32,352
He gets into really spotty animal metaphors

605
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:34,144
But I don't think are appropriate

606
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:36,704
Very not good

607
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:38,752
Analyze

608
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:42,848
The new Al-Qaeda and the

609
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:47,456
Al-Qaeda

610
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:57,440
Western governments all financing years ago years ago

611
00:31:57,696 --> 00:32:03,840
Exactly two years ago

612
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:11,520
This is a real person Army

613
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:18,432
He has said that over and over again

614
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:22,272
He's not wrong about

615
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,880
At one point

616
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:29,696
Syria is definitely

617
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:33,024
We're doing most

618
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:35,584
And then you have

619
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:38,912
Muslim

620
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,192
Islam

621
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:41,472
Bright

622
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:43,264
Isis itself isn't

623
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:45,312
Created by us

624
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:49,920
Accepting a tertiary Cent

625
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:53,760
And any like the instances where there are

626
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:55,040
Like things that have

627
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:57,088
We have Supply that have gone back to them

628
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,368
Pretty accidentally

629
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,184
In the same way that you know

630
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:03,488
You give somebody s*** and someone takes it

631
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,328
Like how we

632
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:10,656
Sent a billion dollars in cash or whatever it was

633
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,472
Sure

634
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:18,848
Questions are you going to cash

635
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:19,616
Hash

636
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:22,944
Weird very weird

637
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,480
Hash in a

638
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:29,088
I've no idea

639
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:32,416
Possible

640
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:33,696
Possible

641
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:41,888
Western world and the Middle East

642
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:49,568
As a proxy for the under Saudi Arabia

643
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:56,224
Potion to use for the next day

644
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:05,440
Is the Muslims rats real

645
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:07,232
But it was manufactured

646
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:20,544
Accomplice to it

647
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,080
I put the rattlesnakes in the back

648
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:23,872
What's your emergency

649
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:31,040
Control

650
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:32,576
Where did you find

651
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:37,184
With 15 starving wolves

652
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:42,816
Run the World

653
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:46,144
Another

654
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:56,640
Three examples of the same exact a little accepting rhetorically unnecessary

655
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:57,664
Stewardship

656
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:03,808
10 million ladybugs in there

657
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:08,416
He doesn't another hour of just examples of ways he could accidentally

658
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:13,280
So I mean 50 at the argument that he's he's making there

659
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:17,376
I don't think that this is the way he would make it but there is a way to make it

660
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:18,400
Reasonable a

661
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:21,216
And that is that our foreign policy is so f***** up

662
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:23,264
We keep creating Terror

663
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,056
Through bombing churches

664
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:26,080
Through

665
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:30,432
Starving Children through killing civilians

666
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:31,712
And that is

667
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:35,552
Creating more and more people who want to hurt us

668
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:36,576
I think

669
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:38,368
What do you saying is

670
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:39,136
Is different

671
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,184
I don't know what he say

672
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,792
Well okay

673
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:46,816
Yours the interest

674
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:49,888
Cynical

675
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:51,424
I do have that

676
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:52,960
Inclination

677
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:54,496
Agree with that idea

678
00:35:54,752 --> 00:36:00,640
Oh man what are what are you big Alex Jones

679
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:04,480
If I was going to conspiracy theories

680
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:05,760
Yeah

681
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:06,528
Nn

682
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:07,808
I think I think

683
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:08,576
He's not

684
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:09,856
Terribly wrong

685
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,392
Describing

686
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:13,696
People who judge

687
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:17,024
Incapable of thinking

688
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:20,864
Haha

689
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:27,520
Or even the potential consequences are outweighed by whatever immediate game you're trying to make

690
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:30,080
Terrorism thing

691
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:31,616
Is absolutely

692
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:33,408
2X

693
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:36,992
Like there's no other way to describe

694
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:37,760
What's going on

695
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:40,064
Now is that cuz there's

696
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,600
Globalist plot or is

697
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:42,368
Is it because

698
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:43,648
All of our weapons

699
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:44,416
Went over to Iraq

700
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:45,440
And we don't need the

701
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:46,976
And we Spanish

702
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:48,768
Kind of money on it so we want to get some of that

703
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:50,560
So we sell it to police

704
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:52,352
Isaac

705
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:55,424
I think that is definitely the

706
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:57,984
Economic

707
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:58,752
Version

708
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:01,568
Are there economic explanation for the militarization

709
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,360
Some of the police force

710
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:06,432
But I don't think that terrorism necessarily

711
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:09,504
He's creating that friend of militarized police

712
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,296
I think it's beef at the fake

713
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:12,576
Fear of terrorism

714
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,624
Actually not created

715
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,160
As much by the globalist

716
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:21,792
Edited by people like Alex Jones ironically giving away your rights

717
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:22,816
You need to

718
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:24,096
Yourself again

719
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:28,448
Yeah strong government with a strong military

720
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,472
Spell obviously

721
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:30,496
You don't want that cover

722
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:31,776
Control over

723
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:35,872
You want them to be able to

724
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:39,968
Military force

725
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:43,552
.0001

726
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:46,112
I put another death

727
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,976
But then it also

728
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,536
He's trying to have it both ways

729
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:54,304
With that Arch

730
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:56,608
You know it is that like

731
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:00,448
I think you nailed it we want this strong government but they're not strong

732
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,264
Stay out of my business

733
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:06,848
But don't give us anything

734
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:07,616
Yeah

735
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:09,664
I'm sick of having stuff from you

736
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:11,712
I don't want to be dependent on the government

737
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,832
Now admittedly I have a radio show

738
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,440
Flint Michigan where they don't even have fun

739
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:27,584
Can regular drinking water even though we've known about it

740
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:30,400
Any other method that

741
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,936
Outdoor

742
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:33,472
But also

743
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,240
I mean like

744
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:38,592
Did you make some money off of people buying guns from a Christian gun maker

745
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:43,456
Where are we

746
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:44,992
What is going on

747
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:46,272
Anyway I think

748
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:48,064
I think you're right

749
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,904
This sort of area there's a little bit more interesting gray area

750
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,464
I still disagree with Alex I think it's full of s***

751
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,744
I disagree with him

752
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,768
Tubidy

753
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:58,816
Like

754
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,352
It isn't

755
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:01,120
Tyson

756
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:02,144
Because

757
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:07,776
Your ears seeing that you're smelling the Tramp alittle more

758
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:08,544
It sounds like

759
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,312
Man

760
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:10,848
Then I go

761
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:11,872
Say that

762
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:14,176
In the government

763
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:15,712
Smart enough to

764
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:16,480
Polish

765
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:18,784
Right right right

766
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:20,064
Who aren't

767
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,088
Borderline

768
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:25,952
Moronic let's count of the charm of 9/11

769
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:29,024
Anyway Alex

770
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:30,304
Wants you to know

771
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,352
But he's got great information

772
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,240
You look marvelous

773
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:44,128
So this next clip Alex accidentally says something that makes him think twice

774
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:51,552
Never seen that before he's talking about how his information is rock-solid

775
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:53,088
He gets good information

776
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,392
But then he starts to talk about it

777
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:57,440
Since his we're in the past where

778
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:59,232
Other people's information

779
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:00,256
Is that this

780
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:04,608
And I think there's a moment you can see in his face was kind of like

781
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:09,984
Shoulda brought this up a little defensive and throws to break

782
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:11,776
So

783
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:15,872
I know this 20 years ago

784
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,992
Rockefeller

785
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:26,880
I read the opposition to it

786
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:33,536
If I was in a war which I am

787
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:52,736
Operating unquote attacking us

788
00:40:58,368 --> 00:41:01,440
This is back when he may be couldn't skip as many breaks

789
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:04,768
For the Mercer money came in as I suspect

790
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:08,096
Is another idea that he has

791
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:09,120
It's based on

792
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:11,680
Illuminati beliefs

793
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:12,960
This idea of like

794
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:15,776
Sort of externalizing program

795
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:20,640
He got to show people what you're doing in order for it to be so mean anyting

796
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:26,016
Are a lot of times when you talk about these Illuminati rituals that they do the halftime shows and stuff

797
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:27,552
It's called a lesser Magic

798
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:29,088
Whatever you like

799
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:31,136
Eyebrow raised

800
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:34,208
Yeah

801
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:37,024
If this idea of it even extend

802
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,816
To like putting something

803
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:42,144
The globalists are going to do into a science fiction movie

804
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,168
So it like

805
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:49,824
People used to the idea

806
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,616
Magic game

807
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:53,919
Things in plain sight

808
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:57,503
End up putting out all their white papers that say these things out

809
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:58,527
Think they say

810
00:41:58,783 --> 00:41:59,551
Don't

811
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:03,391
Is another part of that which again feeds into that

812
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:04,671
Little bit of that song

813
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:07,487
Which is like why they had

814
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:09,279
Pullman become

815
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:11,327
Independence Day

816
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:12,607
Paired

817
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:13,375
For him to be

818
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:15,423
Absolutely

819
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:16,959
Totally

820
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:22,335
Who else would we lost him

821
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:23,359
No we lost pack

822
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:26,175
Does next Wipeout

823
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:28,479
Get super condescending about how you need to wake

824
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:29,759
Fuk up

825
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:37,695
I'm really tired

826
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:50,495
AMF World part of them

827
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:54,079
Red Palace 2 we're going to fire you if you do anymore

828
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:00,735
Sulzer keep keep in mind that he said

829
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:02,271
Basically

830
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:05,087
That's it that's a qualifying word

831
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:05,855
It is

832
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:07,391
It is we say it a lot

833
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:09,183
Basically with you

834
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:11,999
But whenever you're not making a real surgeon

835
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:15,583
Stuff like basically

836
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:23,519
Betsy beers a freelancer

837
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:27,359
Federal

838
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:37,855
The third world

839
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:43,743
About how they would depress economies

840
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:53,983
Companies themselves bailed out by the country

841
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:56,031
And the public is true

842
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:00,383
Is the proper word

843
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:02,175
Totally literacy

844
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:04,735
When it comes to basic Financial system

845
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:07,807
MBC that's all

846
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:10,879
Within the Paradigm of the control

847
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:13,439
So that itself

848
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:17,791
I don't know

849
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:23,679
Trying to say I don't know what that the end I don't I don't I don't

850
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:25,983
You just

851
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:32,127
Every single thing he was saying up to that barzyk really even the world work

852
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:35,711
What are you what are you doing which button

853
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:37,503
The Big Bang

854
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:38,271
Did

855
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:42,879
They did

856
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:43,647
Cars

857
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:45,951
Them to get ahold

858
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:48,511
And then the banks themselves were bailed out five

859
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:54,911
Yes this is true because it's now

860
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:57,983
Not enough to sell your f****** huckster

861
00:44:58,239 --> 00:44:58,751
If you

862
00:44:59,007 --> 00:44:59,775
I think it is

863
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:02,079
I don't

864
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:04,127
I think it's enough

865
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:05,663
For me to want

866
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:09,247
Just fires all over the

867
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:12,575
IMS plan

868
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:14,879
Riot

869
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:18,463
And then when you're burning down cities the globalist

870
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:23,327
Can come in and buy everything up for super cheap let's get them

871
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:25,887
No but here's the thing so I did Google

872
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:28,959
Condescendingly told me to 2 years ago

873
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:30,495
Yes I googled this

874
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:35,103
I looked for IMS leaks 2002

875
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:38,687
And I found an article in the guardian by Greg Palace

876
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:40,735
Where he doesn't

877
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:46,111
He doesn't interview with a guy who used to work for the IMs

878
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:47,903
And got fired

879
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:49,695
Ugly

880
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:51,999
And he had some really terrible things to say

881
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:54,047
About the IMF and how they operate

882
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:55,839
I think a lot of it is

883
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:57,887
Spiritually fairly accurate

884
00:45:58,655 --> 00:45:59,935
Stuff about like

885
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:00,703
You know

886
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:01,471
Beggars

887
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:02,495
Take it

888
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:04,543
Getting countries to borrow more

889
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:06,079
Then they showed him

890
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:07,359
Default on their loans

891
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:10,175
But you buy up like their water plants and stuff like that

892
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:13,503
And then you can even just basically f*** over a country

893
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:15,551
But there's nothing in there

894
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:17,855
Just the America

895
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:20,927
There's nothing in his article

896
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:22,719
And there are no leaks

897
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:27,583
That are out anywhere I couldn't find any primary documents

898
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:30,143
Right

899
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:32,191
Documents

900
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:34,751
In that article but they aren't anywhere

901
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:36,799
Republic

902
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:38,079
They never got

903
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:42,431
Put out or whatever but I'm not going to go to

904
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:43,967
But they're not

905
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:45,759
But

906
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:46,783
So

907
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:49,087
Nowhere in any of it has

908
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:51,903
Anything to do about trying to call

909
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:52,671
Collapse

910
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:54,719
Entire regions of the world

911
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:58,303
There's nothing in there like an evil plan that the West is neck

912
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:00,607
All this stuff is fantasies

913
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:01,887
From Alex's brain

914
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:03,167
Which is

915
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:04,191
The basic

916
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:05,983
That I was talking about earlier

917
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:13,407
The truth he's got a guild that s*** and that's where it becomes a lie

918
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:14,943
And it becomes propaganda

919
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:15,711
Serving

920
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:18,271
His globalist One World Government

921
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:19,295
Boner

922
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:22,623
Paranoia brain

923
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:24,415
Is that

924
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:25,439
It seems like an

925
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:28,511
Twisted in the

926
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:29,279
The current

927
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:30,815
That lead

928
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:32,351
Pizza

929
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:36,191
Seems like he's divorced from reality

930
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:37,471
Yeah

931
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:41,055
F*** that popcorn

932
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:43,359
I don't start at the beginning

933
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:46,687
Vulture totally given to me

934
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:47,455
Trumps

935
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:50,783
I told you I'm not supposed to have

936
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:58,975
But I told you before we started recording we're going to see if Alex Jones

937
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:00,511
But he's still a liar

938
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:06,655
He's still bulshit artist still obsessed with the globalist different dude

939
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:07,423
By this

940
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:08,959
I'm not Charmed

941
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:11,263
But I do

942
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:13,823
This way I'm I'm much more

943
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:15,103
Willing to enter

944
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:17,407
Then I am

945
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:18,687
You know

946
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:19,967
They're attempting

947
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:20,991
Sticks all over

948
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:25,087
He still thinks that though it is a point

949
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:26,623
Whether we're going to get to where I think you might

950
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:28,927
You will get to it Alex Jones

951
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:30,463
Shining through

952
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:33,791
Here's a clip where he is

953
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:36,607
Very he would never say this today

954
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:43,775
Number 326

955
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:47,103
I do not agree with this at all he would be

956
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:50,943
God damned if you said this today

957
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:00,415
Russia

958
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:08,095
Is defending its population

959
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:13,215
What is faultless

960
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:22,175
Shutdown

961
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:24,223
American

962
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:30,111
WikiLeaks

963
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:40,351
The New World Order frog

964
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:42,655
So there's nowhere to run

965
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:44,703
Russia

966
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:56,479
When there is no firewall firewall

967
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:05,695
A global government

968
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:07,231
LV Nowhere to Run

969
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:12,351
People running this world government

970
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:15,935
The world has ever seen

971
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:21,567
Maximum Alpha tyrant

972
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:25,919
Maximum

973
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:31,807
Alpha Tyrant is the sort of linguistic version of three examples of animals in your bed

974
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:34,623
If excessive we gotcha

975
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:39,743
Well I think that's a great beer to Great IPA

976
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:45,375
Country black widows in your bed

977
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:52,543
He would never say those things like he still says

978
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:55,359
Did George Soros is responsible for Ukraine

979
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:56,895
The uprising in Ukraine

980
00:50:57,919 --> 00:51:00,223
But like for overthrowing Ukraine

981
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:03,295
Viciously

982
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:04,575
From his language

983
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:07,391
Pretty much since Donald Trump got around

984
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:09,951
These positive things

985
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:10,719
About Putin

986
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:12,255
And about how

987
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:13,279
The Russians

988
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:15,839
We're just protecting their people in the brain

989
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:22,239
Absolutely, people have a maximum Alpha tyrant

990
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:32,223
Sure he's not literally resembling

991
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:34,527
Episode

992
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:35,295
Yeah

993
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:36,831
Crazy

994
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:38,879
Still crazy

995
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:41,183
He's gone so far back

996
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:42,975
Forced on all of this

997
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:43,743
It's

998
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:47,583
Like I wonder I wonder if there is a step

999
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:48,351
Too far for him

1000
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:50,399
Is it is there any

1001
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:51,167
Anything that

1002
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:52,191
He will not

1003
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:52,959
Switching

1004
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:53,727
Globalist

1005
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:56,799
Yeah but the definition

1006
00:51:57,055 --> 00:52:00,639
That's great that's great point

1007
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:02,175
Always ever change

1008
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:05,247
Yeah if you can be a globalist one day

1009
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:06,015
And a

1010
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:06,783
Patriot the

1011
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:09,087
Much like

1012
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:11,135
The bouncing back and forth on WikiLeaks

1013
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:12,415
Everyone

1014
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:13,695
Right now

1015
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:17,535
Where is like

1016
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:22,399
No I I guess in that case no there's no

1017
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:24,959
Second Amendment

1018
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:25,983
Maybe

1019
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:31,871
Because he

1020
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:38,271
You didn't always used to be so into God as he is now so that's even like a little wobbly

1021
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:39,807
He can't go back

1022
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:41,343
His belief in God

1023
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:43,903
What it is God wants

1024
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:49,791
Sure esoteric weird God but

1025
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:51,327
The twelfth dimension

1026
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:52,351
That are out the

1027
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:53,887
Didn't go back on that one

1028
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:57,471
I think it might just be the Second Amendment

1029
00:52:57,727 --> 00:53:00,799
Like the only thing he has

1030
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:02,847
If you turned against guns

1031
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:04,895
You would lose almost all of his body

1032
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:06,175
Yeah that's probably

1033
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:11,551
Now there's a lot of weird factions in his audience that I think one of the biggest through-line

1034
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:15,391
Wow so

1035
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:16,671
Wait what

1036
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:27,423
But it was cool to years ago

1037
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:31,775
So this next clip he's going to talk he's talking about Greece

1038
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:34,591
So much

1039
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:35,359
Said about Greece

1040
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:37,151
As all repetition

1041
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:39,199
It's all just

1042
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:41,247
The globalist they're planning

1043
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:42,271
To take them down

1044
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:44,575
Blah blah blah

1045
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:46,111
The great people themselves

1046
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:47,391
No

1047
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:51,743
Globalist

1048
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:53,279
Sure

1049
00:53:55,327 --> 00:53:58,143
The victims of his banking system

1050
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:02,495
So in the end is next Clippers and talk about how

1051
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:04,799
It's a bank holiday

1052
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:06,847
Because on a real nice Ram

1053
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:08,383
Real nice riff

1054
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:11,199
On the idea of a bank holiday does a little bit

1055
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:12,735
And then

1056
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:14,271
Before we go any further

1057
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:15,039
Right

1058
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:16,319
What the f***

1059
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:19,135
Is he talking about with his Barry Goldwater and Rockefeller

1060
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:20,415
Who cares

1061
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:23,743
Who cares where are these weird-ass roof

1062
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:24,767
She's coming from

1063
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:29,887
Books he read and didn't understand years and years ago that's all that's gone

1064
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:31,423
I've learned not

1065
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:37,823
To chase these rabbit rabbit down the hole

1066
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:40,895
Reference and consistently they don't say what he says

1067
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:43,711
Book by Barry Goldwater

1068
00:54:44,223 --> 00:54:45,247
I'm just not going to do it

1069
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:46,527

Bank holiday

1076
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:05,215
Loses the thread

1077
00:55:05,727 --> 00:55:07,007
Right loses the thread

1078
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:08,287
Starts rambling

1079
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:10,847

Do you have any idea what he's talking about

1094
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:40,447
The reason Greece

1095
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:41,215

Water skiing

1098
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:46,847
Because

1099
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:48,383
They didn't know what the referendum

1100
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:50,943
There was a huge

1101
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:51,967
Chance they would

1102
00:56:59,135 --> 00:57:05,279
Which is a natural human reaction to your money but if you're hurting ever

1103
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:06,047
Everybody else

1104
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:07,583

1105
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:10,143

00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:16,543
People for people to close bags but it's actually in everyone's best interest

1107
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:19,103
Manipulative in like hey

1108
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:23,455

If you were a foreigner you could take money out

1116
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:55,967
So what he was doing and a lot of people were doing

1117
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:59,039
Was that they were since they have foreign bank accounts

1118
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:01,343
Helping

1119
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:04,927
As though there was a bunch of resources on the ground

1120

00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:30,015
Now he goes on to say

1130
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:31,807
He makes a great point

1131
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:34,111

Then goes on to rant about men in dresses with mustache

1139
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:54,591
Who's Leslie

1140
00:58:55,103 --> 00:58:57,151
You don't know I don't know who Liza globalist

1141

Picked him to be the face of things still don't know who that is

1142
00:59:00,479 --> 00:59:03,295

00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:06,623
I'm going to tell you and the listeners who Leslie is

1144
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:08,415
But before I do

1145
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:10,719
What you just use one name

1146
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:16,351
Leslie Nielsen

1147
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:17,631
Yeah

1148
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:21,471
But also if you don't know who Leslie is or you do

1149
00:59:22,751 --> 00:59:24,031
I want take a little Pole

1150
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:25,823
Before I tell you who he is

1151
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:27,615
Go ahead and buy sound off

1152
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:29,151
Now I'll tell you

1153
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:31,199
Leslie

1154
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:33,759
Leslie was a homeless activist

1155
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:35,039
And Austin TX

1156
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:40,671
You homeless for many years and was a huge advocate but headed up a lot of causes

1157
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:41,951
For homeless rights

1158
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:43,999
Police brutality rights these sorts of things

1159
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:47,583
Ultimatum ultimatum big spectacle out of himself

1160
00:59:48,095 --> 00:59:50,655
I wore women's clothing crossdresser

1161
00:59:50,911 --> 00:59:53,471
Wear women's clothing around 6th Street

1162
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:56,287
And go and hang around get the word out

1163
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:57,567
He'd also like to party

1164
00:59:57,823 --> 01:00:01,407
He party around 2 if that's how I ended up beating him I was partying on 6th Street

1165
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:03,199
Andy came up new super nice

1166
01:00:03,455 --> 01:00:04,223
We smoked a cigarette

1167
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:05,759
And I we hug

1168
01:00:06,015 --> 01:00:07,295
There's a picture of us somewhere

1169
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:11,647
2012

1170
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:14,975
After he got the s*** beat out of him in 2009

1171
01:00:16,511 --> 01:00:19,327
He was I who found unconscious Outdoors

1172
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:21,887
I was transported to University Medical Center

1173
01:00:22,143 --> 01:00:22,911
Critical condition

1174
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:23,679
2009

1175
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:25,471
Does October 3rd 2009

1176
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:29,567
Within two weeks you regained Consciousness and was transferred to a rehabilitation

1177
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:32,383
When he was released on October 23rd

1178
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:33,663
2009

1179
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:34,687
That's a vibe

1180
01:00:34,943 --> 01:00:39,551
Reported that he had been attacked after commenting to group of people about the dangers of drugs

1181
01:00:40,831 --> 01:00:42,879
Just reasonably responsible

1182
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:45,183
Believable that's within the scope of

1183
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:46,975
Yeah sort of

1184
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:49,535
Active

1185
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:50,815
Sure

1186
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:51,583
Also

1187
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:54,911
Not outside the spectrum of reality that he was beat up

1188
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:56,959
Because he is an old crossdress

1189
01:00:57,471 --> 01:01:01,567
Yeah there's a possibility that these people beat him up for that after he said something about truck

1190
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:05,151
Those people are there

1191
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:08,991
Kicked out of in 2009 and suffered head trauma then

1192
01:01:09,247 --> 01:01:11,295
Three years later two and a half years later

1193
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:14,623
I just deteriorated from that

1194
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:16,415
Ended up

1195
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:18,463
Trying to get some brain surgery

1196
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:21,791
It was successful.

1197
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:22,815
After that okay

1198
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:29,983
Tragic story is also a very empowering story someone who

1199
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:31,263
I did a lot with his wife

1200
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:34,335
Depression on millions of people

1201
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:36,895
And help the charitable causes that have helped

1202
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:38,431
Tons and tons of people

1203
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:40,991
F*** you for minimizing him in such a way

1204
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:41,759
To say that either

1205
01:01:42,271 --> 01:01:43,039
Trendy

1206
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:45,855
In addressing a mustache you piece of s***

1207
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:49,695
Was

1208
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:50,463
Would like

1209
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:52,767
To the point where

1210
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:55,071
With all of his support

1211
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:56,863
If he had asked for it

1212
01:01:57,887 --> 01:01:58,911
People would have

1213
01:01:59,423 --> 01:02:00,191
Made him not home

1214
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:02,495
Correct

1215
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:05,311
The towards the end of his life you may not have been home

1216
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:09,151
I think throughout a lot of it

1217
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:11,455
After that I mean Alex Jones

1218
01:02:17,087 --> 01:02:17,599
He did

1219
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:19,135
An immense amount

1220
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:21,183
And Alex Jones

1221
01:02:21,439 --> 01:02:21,951
Has

1222
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:22,719
Turn that

1223
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:24,511
Ura

1224
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:27,071
Meaningless

1225
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:30,655
You've made money off your homeless app

1226
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:34,239
Or whatever it was

1227
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:35,519
Now which

1228
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:37,823
Absolutely would gain you much more

1229
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:41,407
I would also say that he ran for mayor 3

1230
01:02:41,919 --> 01:02:42,431
X

1231
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:49,343
Does like that would run for office

1232
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:51,647
Mystery novels about him and his crime

1233
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:52,671
Yeah but like it's

1234
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:55,231
Full of awesome weird personality

1235
01:02:55,487 --> 01:02:56,767
Anyway

1236
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:57,791
As we discussed

1237
01:02:58,303 --> 01:02:59,583
They had what was it

1238
01:03:00,095 --> 01:03:01,375
Was it a balloon store

1239
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:07,007
Pinata store

1240
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:07,775
Pinatas

1241
01:03:08,031 --> 01:03:14,175
Next to a cat trying to shut down

1242
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:16,223
Misunderstanding of b*******

1243
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:23,391
I was like

1244
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:24,671
I know Leslie

1245
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:25,695
That's awesome

1246
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:28,511
Yeah super cool

1247
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:29,791
Alex come on

1248
01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:31,583
He should know better

1249
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:33,119
Alex's the closed-minded

1250
01:03:33,631 --> 01:03:34,143
Yeah

1251
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:35,679
How do you

1252
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:46,431
Hero the world

1253
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:47,199
But

1254
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:49,247
Probably also a drunk let's

1255
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:50,271
Be clear

1256
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:54,111
Mental illness

1257
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:55,391
All of that

1258
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:58,975
I have no doubt that by no means was he

1259
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:01,535
Sure at the same time

1260
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:06,399
I am not a saint nicer as f*** haven't done as much good as Plus

1261
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:16,895
On that level

1262
01:04:21,503 --> 01:04:22,015
Like that

1263
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:23,039
F*****'-a

1264
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:25,855
I am from everything I could look up I see no evidence

1265
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:26,879
Globalist involved

1266
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:28,415
And his wife

1267
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:35,071
So now you might be asking yourself Gaia

1268
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:44,287
You might be asking yourself alright this is

1269
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:45,055
Years in the past

1270
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:45,823
Yes

1271
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:47,103
Did Alex Jones

1272
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:51,455
Always have his smooth as transitioning into a sales pitch scale

1273
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:55,551
You might be asking yourself that I don't think

1274
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:13,215
Before I go any further when I tell you stuff selling out

1275
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:22,943
To his own kind of know

1276
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:25,759
Yeah cuz he did also have a long pause a minute

1277
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:32,159
So now he's not wasn't always as good as having an off-day

1278
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:33,439
Now

1279
01:05:33,695 --> 01:05:35,487
He's gets into this sales trip

1280
01:05:35,743 --> 01:05:36,255
She's overly

1281
01:05:36,511 --> 01:05:37,023
Concerned with

1282
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:38,815
Gay marriage

1283
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:41,119
And getting sued out of existing

1284
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:42,143
Two-and-a-half years

1285
01:05:42,399 --> 01:05:44,959
Listen to the sales pitch

1286
01:05:45,215 --> 01:05:47,263
Who owns me to place in its entirety

1287
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:48,543
But

1288
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:55,455
It's a good thing that I listen to Alex Jones everyday

1289
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:58,783
The only time I've ever set

1290
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:00,831
But if I did

1291
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:02,367
If I did

1292
01:06:02,623 --> 01:06:05,695
I would not have been able to recognize this

1293
01:06:05,951 --> 01:06:06,719
Next clip

1294
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:07,999
As evidence

1295
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:09,535
Of Allah

1296
01:06:10,303 --> 01:06:10,815
In a clip

1297
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:12,095

1298
01:06:12,351 --> 01:06:12,863
On

1299
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:14,911
March 30th episode

1300
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:18,239
He invalidates an argument that he made this March

1301
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:19,519
2 years

1302
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:22,335
This is very exciting for me

1303
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:24,127

But that is the

1306
01:06:27,455 --> 01:06:29,247
Craziest thing I've ever heard of

1307
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:32,063
Listen to this

1308
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:38,463

But you have to go to

1313
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:52,031
Contracts got a bid

1314
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:56,127

Cuz you got to find the weirdo companies that are out Drilling in the right area that will do for them

1317
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:25,567

Live.com

1319
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:33,247
Now the clip from the March 30th episode is way too f****** long for me to play here cuz I'm almost

1320
01:07:33,503 --> 01:07:35,295
At the point of Tears drunk sales pitch

1321
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:40,415

On March 30th of 2017

1324
01:07:44,511 --> 01:07:45,279
He was saying

1325
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:48,607
Set the globalist we're trying to cut off his iodine

1326
01:07:48,863 --> 01:07:49,375
Supply

1327
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:52,703
And he was using almost every single argument

1328
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:56,543
The cheapest made here for a while

1329
01:07:57,055 --> 01:07:58,591
He but he was saying that it was

1330
01:07:58,847 --> 01:08:00,383
Some sort of concerted effort against him

1331
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:06,527
Listen not many people do they thread

1332
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:08,063
Do wooden a******

1333
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:09,087
No I can

1334
01:08:10,111 --> 01:08:10,623
I couldn't

1335
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:11,391
TV argument

1336
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:17,279
Okay

1337
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:20,351
Know about his beeper

1338
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:21,887
And the wacky

1339
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:22,655
People

1340
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:23,423
Who do that

1341
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:24,703
Now they're going

1342
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:27,007
I don't like

1343
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:31,103
I love you I love you sweetie

1344
01:08:31,615 --> 01:08:33,663
It's not speeches its frustration cuz it's like

1345
01:08:34,431 --> 01:08:36,223
Yeah okay fine

1346
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:36,991
Alright

1347
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:38,015
Done

1348
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:44,415
Alex Jones game is playing

1349
01:08:44,671 --> 01:08:47,231
Every single argument

1350
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:51,071
No

1351
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:52,351
I'm super powers

1352
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:59,007
Super male Vitality I'm doing just fine right there

1353
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:01,567
I don't have the

1354
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:07,967
Whatever else it is unclear

1355
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:11,807
I don't either understand any of

1356
01:09:12,063 --> 01:09:13,087
The deeper the iodine

1357
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:15,135
That according to all of the scientific

1358
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:16,671
Research that I have read

1359
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:17,951
There is

1360
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:18,975
Plano

1361
01:09:19,999 --> 01:09:23,327
I have read some reviews of some of his product

1362
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:24,095
Recently

1363
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:26,911
I don't know if they're jokes

1364
01:09:27,423 --> 01:09:28,447
Or not

1365
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:34,079
Like they're so bizarre that I don't know if there's someone making

1366
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:35,103
Like just trolling

1367
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:38,943
I have no idea but there are a number of them for caveman

1368
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:44,063
His bone broth

1369
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:45,855
She loves it taste like chocolate

1370
01:09:46,367 --> 01:09:49,695
There's a bunch of them though have the same sort of

1371
01:09:49,951 --> 01:09:51,999
Hatter they follow the same pattern that is

1372
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:53,279
I

1373
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:55,327
Can't not take this

1374
01:09:56,351 --> 01:10:01,727
Okay but it's not like I feel so good when I'm on it as if I feel so shity when I don't take

1375
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:05,823
And that to me to me in the cave

1376
01:10:06,591 --> 01:10:08,127
Like I know

1377
01:10:08,383 --> 01:10:08,895
From

1378
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:14,271
Pastor cute that you get into an elevated state for a long enough time

1379
01:10:14,527 --> 01:10:20,671
Normal feel shity

1380
01:10:20,927 --> 01:10:23,999
Really sucks with all your heart rate whatever bone this

1381
01:10:24,255 --> 01:10:28,095
The chaga mushroom and all this b*******.

1382
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:35,263
I don't know what the f*** else is in there it's about

1383
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:40,895
And s*** like that trucker speed all of the all of the GNC

1384
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:42,431
Vitamin

1385
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:45,503
Regulated by the

1386
01:10:46,015 --> 01:10:49,087
Spend billions of dollars

1387
01:10:49,343 --> 01:10:50,367
Sure

1388
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:52,159
Millions of.

1389
01:10:54,975 --> 01:10:55,999
Yeah but

1390
01:10:57,535 --> 01:10:59,839
It makes total sense to be like

1391
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:02,911
The diesel joke review

1392
01:11:03,423 --> 01:11:04,447
Yeah

1393
01:11:04,703 --> 01:11:07,775
Totally I would believe is that it really sucks you up

1394
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:09,823
In a good way

1395
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:14,431
Basically

1396
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:16,479
A couple of drinks

1397
01:11:16,991 --> 01:11:18,527
A couple of or even like

1398
01:11:18,783 --> 01:11:22,111
Once this goes off sale I'm not going to be able to afford it

1399
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:23,903
And I'm really going to miss it

1400
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:29,535
I need it is really a huge bummer which actually could

1401
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:31,583
Bring into focus is

1402
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:32,607
Economic model

1403
01:11:32,863 --> 01:11:39,007
A little bit tougher to sort of habit forming

1404
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:40,031
53 /

1405
01:11:41,311 --> 01:11:43,103
It totally makes sense as a model

1406
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:45,919
If you tell

1407
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:47,711
You got a couple more clips

1408
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:50,783
And then we're going to delve into two

1409
01:11:51,295 --> 01:11:51,807
Adventures

1410
01:11:52,063 --> 01:11:52,831
Adventurism

1411
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:53,599
What happened

1412
01:11:56,671 --> 01:11:57,439
So is

1413
01:11:58,207 --> 01:11:58,975
Really

1414
01:11:59,231 --> 01:12:00,255
Really unfortunate

1415
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:02,047
Alex is walking

1416
01:12:02,303 --> 01:12:03,839
What I would describe as

1417
01:12:04,351 --> 01:12:05,375
Tightrope of a metaphor

1418
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:07,423
And I don't think you succeeded

1419
01:12:08,703 --> 01:12:09,215
I love his

1420
01:12:09,471 --> 01:12:11,007
I love is in village

1421
01:12:11,519 --> 01:12:15,103
This is dangerous is like

1422
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:16,127
If I threw

1423
01:12:16,895 --> 01:12:18,175
100 black widows

1424
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:20,479
Into his Studio

1425
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:23,039
Them in their own separate

1426
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:24,063
Okay

1427
01:12:25,087 --> 01:12:29,695
Great metaphor I'm going to say because this is such a tightrope

1428
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:33,279
Let's put the mic down and enjoy this because

1429
01:12:34,303 --> 01:12:35,583
I think we're going

1430
01:12:35,839 --> 01:12:36,607
To hear him make

1431
01:12:37,631 --> 01:12:41,471
Something that borders on a very racist

1432
01:12:41,727 --> 01:12:43,775
Metaphor

1433
01:12:46,335 --> 01:12:48,127
But now it hits my ears

1434
01:12:48,383 --> 01:12:54,527
Very racist because I could see it

1435
01:12:54,783 --> 01:12:57,343
For what he's trying to say

1436
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:03,487
He's talking about with

1437
01:13:03,743 --> 01:13:04,255
The globalist

1438
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:08,095
If you work against

1439
01:13:10,655 --> 01:13:11,935
Good

1440
01:13:12,959 --> 01:13:17,055
Because instinctively

1441
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:20,383
Because they're jealous

1442
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:21,919
And they have historical

1443
01:13:29,599 --> 01:13:30,623
Over and over again

1444
01:13:31,135 --> 01:13:32,159
Them

1445
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:34,207
Corruptible

1446
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:45,471
Talk about genetics

1447
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:48,287
No

1448
01:13:48,543 --> 01:13:49,311
You can

1449
01:13:50,591 --> 01:13:52,895
Oh no don't get dachshund

1450
01:13:53,151 --> 01:13:55,199
It comes from really mentally ill biters

1451
01:13:55,455 --> 01:13:58,271
That's really a screwed-up breeder they got problems

1452
01:14:01,087 --> 01:14:01,599
Dog

1453
01:14:04,415 --> 01:14:10,559
You got a race between good health

1454
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:11,583
Think about power

1455
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:13,887
Do you want the power

1456
01:14:17,215 --> 01:14:23,359
You don't work 95 and put the kids through college and then go out to the

1457
01:14:42,815 --> 01:14:45,119
Get the latest Mark Dice video it's one of the worst ever

1458
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:53,823
I love I love that plug at the end

1459
01:14:54,079 --> 01:14:55,103
What I agree

1460
01:14:55,359 --> 01:15:00,735
It's terrible so what's this a metaphor

1461
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:09,439
Sourate more races that he couches it with me I'm not talking about a black bloodline

1462
01:15:09,695 --> 01:15:13,535
Immediately went to I am protecting myself

1463
01:15:14,815 --> 01:15:16,863
Coil full on I'm not a racist

1464
01:15:17,119 --> 01:15:23,263
But perfectly absolutely

1465
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:26,847
The reason I said it was on the border is because what the point is

1466
01:15:27,103 --> 01:15:30,431
Trying to make I think is that these globalists

1467
01:15:30,687 --> 01:15:31,967
Come from different stock than

1468
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:35,039
We were genetically engineered

1469
01:15:37,343 --> 01:15:39,391
I think I remember the five percent

1470
01:15:39,647 --> 01:15:40,671
Sedation.

1471
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:44,255
I'm glad to have another induction

1472
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:48,607
I don't think

1473
01:15:49,375 --> 01:15:53,471
You can never you can never make that argument succinctly like that he's trying to make

1474
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:55,775
When you're using genetic lines

1475
01:15:56,031 --> 01:15:59,615
And stuff like that there's less and less and less

1476
01:15:59,871 --> 01:16:01,919
Full hog

1477
01:16:02,175 --> 01:16:03,199
And you are saying

1478
01:16:03,455 --> 01:16:05,759
That the elite are made up of then like

1479
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:11,903
9 powerful Bloodlines it existed for blood

1480
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:12,671
Then

1481
01:16:13,183 --> 01:16:15,231
Your metaphor is fine you're not being racist

1482
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:16,255
You're being an idiot

1483
01:16:16,511 --> 01:16:19,583
Yeah

1484
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:21,887
So

1485
01:16:22,143 --> 01:16:23,423
The way I understood

1486
01:16:25,471 --> 01:16:26,495
He was trying to

1487
01:16:26,751 --> 01:16:27,263
To say

1488
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:30,591
As Alex Jones's pop

1489
01:16:32,639 --> 01:16:34,431
All humans are

1490
01:16:35,455 --> 01:16:36,735
Genetically

1491
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:39,551
Good

1492
01:16:40,063 --> 01:16:40,831
But

1493
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:43,135
People who are genetically

1494
01:16:43,391 --> 01:16:43,903
Bad

1495
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:46,207
Like the Ducks

1496
01:16:46,463 --> 01:16:49,535
There's a biter spider

1497
01:16:50,047 --> 01:16:50,559
There's

1498
01:16:51,071 --> 01:16:56,959
And now now if you want if you want to pull the the Dachshund transcend race in this metaphor

1499
01:16:57,471 --> 01:16:58,239
I'm fine with that

1500
01:16:58,751 --> 01:16:59,263
Except

1501
01:17:00,287 --> 01:17:01,311
A very specific

1502
01:17:02,335 --> 01:17:02,847
Genetic

1503
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:03,871
Staying

1504
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:05,407
Like the Dachshund

1505
01:17:05,919 --> 01:17:06,431
In particular

1506
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:08,479
Is more like

1507
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:10,271
Idle

1508
01:17:10,527 --> 01:17:12,575
I don't see any way to get out of this

1509
01:17:12,831 --> 01:17:14,111
Without you at least going

1510
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:15,903
Alex

1511
01:17:17,183 --> 01:17:17,951
You know

1512
01:17:19,231 --> 01:17:25,375
You're being racist right especially because it is white

1513
01:17:28,447 --> 01:17:33,823
Somebody was in the bucket Buckley was at the potentiometer lights

1514
01:17:34,079 --> 01:17:35,359
No Alex

1515
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:39,199
Alex

1516
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:44,831
Crystallize this deeper crystallize

1517
01:17:47,391 --> 01:17:50,463
I think the reason that it comes off as racist

1518
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:51,743
Is

1519
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:54,303
Is because this argument has been made by races

1520
01:17:54,815 --> 01:17:59,167
From time immemorial cider inferior because

1521
01:17:59,423 --> 01:18:00,191
Is of the shity blood by

1522
01:18:01,471 --> 01:18:05,567
Argument

1523
01:18:05,823 --> 01:18:06,847
It has that baggage

1524
01:18:07,103 --> 01:18:10,431
That comes along with it when you're talking about something

1525
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:11,711
You know

1526
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:18,111
Like from the start they were like

1527
01:18:18,367 --> 01:18:20,927
Their terman 22b

1528
01:18:21,183 --> 01:18:21,695
Left

1529
01:18:22,207 --> 01:18:22,719
Right

1530
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:29,631
Relates directly back to the protocols of the Elders of Zion

1531
01:18:32,447 --> 01:18:34,751
Zionist cabal has about humans

1532
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:38,079
Alex thinks that the globalists have about us

1533
01:18:38,335 --> 01:18:40,127
It's a direct mirror

1534
01:18:40,383 --> 01:18:41,151
Through this

1535
01:18:42,431 --> 01:18:43,455
Racist

1536
01:18:43,711 --> 01:18:44,223
That's racist

1537
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:47,551
And I think another reason that it is raises I have to stick

1538
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:49,343
This down is because

1539
01:18:49,599 --> 01:18:52,415
The idea of the behavior of being a biter

1540
01:18:52,927 --> 01:18:53,951
Something like that

1541
01:18:54,207 --> 01:18:56,511
That is something that is in your jeans

1542
01:18:57,279 --> 01:18:58,815
That is not like

1543
01:18:59,327 --> 01:19:00,351
Instead of learned behavior

1544
01:19:00,607 --> 01:19:01,375
Yeah it's

1545
01:19:01,631 --> 01:19:02,655
It's just

1546
01:19:02,911 --> 01:19:04,191
It's really troubling

1547
01:19:04,447 --> 01:19:05,983
It's really troubling for me

1548
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:06,751
To hear him

1549
01:19:07,007 --> 01:19:07,775
Make arguments

1550
01:19:08,287 --> 01:19:11,103
Especially because if you are a rapist

1551
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:12,383
And you hear that

1552
01:19:13,151 --> 01:19:15,711
Did you get it

1553
01:19:16,223 --> 01:19:17,247
That is also like a

1554
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:18,015
Smokescreen

1555
01:19:18,271 --> 01:19:19,807
For you to say you're not ready

1556
01:19:20,831 --> 01:19:21,343
Because he

1557
01:19:21,599 --> 01:19:22,367
Preamble that way

1558
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:24,415
It's not about

1559
01:19:24,671 --> 01:19:25,439
White black

1560
01:19:26,207 --> 01:19:26,719
Asian

1561
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:29,023
Peter

1562
01:19:31,327 --> 01:19:33,119
So you get to like hide behind

1563
01:19:35,423 --> 01:19:36,447
It's not that I'm racist

1564
01:19:37,983 --> 01:19:38,495
Talking about

1565
01:19:38,751 --> 01:19:39,263
Natick

1566
01:19:39,519 --> 01:19:40,287
Yeah

1567
01:19:40,799 --> 01:19:41,311
Skin color

1568
01:19:42,847 --> 01:19:47,199
Phrenology

1569
01:19:47,455 --> 01:19:47,967
Good

1570
01:19:52,319 --> 01:19:54,367
And maybe the

1571
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:56,159
People that I think are bad

1572
01:20:01,023 --> 01:20:03,327
At this point Alex introduces the fact that he's going

1573
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:04,351
Start taking calls

1574
01:20:04,863 --> 01:20:05,887
Yes I am

1575
01:20:09,983 --> 01:20:10,495
Introduce

1576
01:20:10,751 --> 01:20:12,543
Topics that he wants to talk about

1577
01:20:12,799 --> 01:20:13,824
Want to talk about Greece

1578
01:20:14,592 --> 01:20:15,872
For a dark but how

1579
01:20:16,384 --> 01:20:17,152
The world is

1580
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:19,712
Being overrun by right

1581
01:20:19,968 --> 01:20:20,480
And then

1582
01:20:20,736 --> 01:20:22,272
Poses this question

1583
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:24,576
That I think is poorly frame

1584
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:28,416
Will Smith

1585
01:20:30,208 --> 01:20:36,352
Bailouts

1586
01:20:36,864 --> 01:20:38,144
Greece

1587
01:20:38,656 --> 01:20:41,728
Seems like neither of those options

1588
01:20:43,008 --> 01:20:43,520
WhatsApp

1589
01:20:43,776 --> 01:20:45,056
I don't know a third option

1590
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:46,592
I can't say

1591
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:52,736
Either this is going to be the great Global meltdown to be another thing that the globalist have orchestrated

1592
01:20:52,992 --> 01:20:56,832
Brett so it's going to be the Great

1593
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:58,880
Not quite it's like

1594
01:20:59,136 --> 01:21:01,440
It's either going to be the worst thing ever or just

1595
01:21:01,696 --> 01:21:02,208
The worst

1596
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:03,232
Yeah

1597
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:06,048
He also doesn't really end up taking any meetings

1598
01:21:06,304 --> 01:21:06,816
Call

1599
01:21:07,072 --> 01:21:09,376
One guy about the

1600
01:21:09,632 --> 01:21:14,240
More about Russia and its exact same

1601
01:21:14,752 --> 01:21:16,032
Yeah but

1602
01:21:16,544 --> 01:21:18,080
No calls were worthwhile it sucks

1603
01:21:18,336 --> 01:21:21,920
Cuz I take up a good amount of the Shelf do we lose like a good 40 minutes

1604
01:21:22,432 --> 01:21:24,224
Of usable materials

1605
01:21:24,992 --> 01:21:26,016
Garbage disposal Falls

1606
01:21:26,528 --> 01:21:27,296
But

1607
01:21:27,552 --> 01:21:33,696
Before he gets to take phone calls in Earnest real quick

1608
01:21:33,952 --> 01:21:36,256
Were there any

1609
01:21:39,328 --> 01:21:41,120
Did any

1610
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:43,424
1

1611
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:45,472
1 grandma

1612
01:21:45,728 --> 01:21:47,520
I'm already on board

1613
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:50,592
If she wanted to talk about how the bond market

1614
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:54,176
If it falls apart

1615
01:21:54,432 --> 01:21:58,016
That is a bad way to Sally if it falls apart

1616
01:21:58,272 --> 01:21:59,296
Then people

1617
01:21:59,552 --> 01:22:00,832
I won't get paid

1618
01:22:01,344 --> 01:22:01,856
And Alex

1619
01:22:02,112 --> 01:22:03,904
Tries to talk like you understand

1620
01:22:04,416 --> 01:22:05,184
The situation

1621
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:08,512
She doesn't do it

1622
01:22:10,304 --> 01:22:10,816
Third party

1623
01:22:11,072 --> 01:22:14,400
I don't really either smell bulshit

1624
01:22:14,656 --> 01:22:17,472
Hey there just dancing around Alex's using $5 word

1625
01:22:17,728 --> 01:22:18,240
She's like

1626
01:22:18,496 --> 01:22:20,032
You know you always talk about this

1627
01:22:20,288 --> 01:22:25,408
This other ring thing you know you got the divide-and-conquer mentalities

1628
01:22:25,664 --> 01:22:28,736
You always talk about black and white but you never talk about in his eye

1629
01:22:35,392 --> 01:22:37,952
Talk about it talk about it more

1630
01:22:38,464 --> 01:22:41,536
Generations

1631
01:22:44,096 --> 01:22:46,144
It's kind of nada

1632
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:52,288
Lenovo think he does

1633
01:22:52,544 --> 01:22:53,056
A bunch

1634
01:22:53,568 --> 01:22:54,080
Episode

1635
01:22:54,336 --> 01:22:55,616
Is introduced Topix

1636
01:22:56,128 --> 01:22:57,408
He's going to get to and dumb

1637
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:00,736
He keeps having like plastic

1638
01:23:03,296 --> 01:23:08,160
Never gets to in Pittsburgh

1639
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:09,696
How about

1640
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:17,888
Is the band The American Flag for about 2 in a minute

1641
01:23:20,448 --> 01:23:21,728
The first thing where I was like

1642
01:23:21,984 --> 01:23:24,288
Phuc yea let's get into this Alex

1643
01:23:24,544 --> 01:23:29,152
So I actually have a lot to say about that before we get

1644
01:23:30,688 --> 01:23:34,528
Religious freedom speech

1645
01:23:39,904 --> 01:23:44,256
Open Society to where we accepted all this

1646
01:23:44,768 --> 01:23:46,560
Now we're not going to be tolerated

1647
01:23:54,752 --> 01:23:56,544
Yes don't want anyone

1648
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:07,040
Don't want to have a Catholic Church

1649
01:24:07,296 --> 01:24:09,088
Finger shut down no good

1650
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:12,672
This is the opposite of Tolerance immune system

1651
01:24:13,696 --> 01:24:16,512
No one is forcing a church to pay for abortions

1652
01:24:16,768 --> 01:24:17,792
Know everybody was

1653
01:24:18,048 --> 01:24:23,936
No I remember I remember the most important thing that I talked

1654
01:24:24,704 --> 01:24:25,216
With a lot of people

1655
01:24:25,984 --> 01:24:26,496
Hey

1656
01:24:26,752 --> 01:24:27,264
You know what I want

1657
01:24:27,776 --> 01:24:29,824
Forest churches

1658
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:31,104
To pay for Maya

1659
01:24:32,896 --> 01:24:35,968
Having no give me money

1660
01:24:36,224 --> 01:24:36,992
Catholic Church

1661
01:24:37,248 --> 01:24:37,760
Also

1662
01:24:38,016 --> 01:24:39,040
Nobody

1663
01:24:39,296 --> 01:24:40,064
To pay for those aboard

1664
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:41,344
So

1665
01:24:45,952 --> 01:24:47,488
You have a right to put on a dress

1666
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:48,512
Yes

1667
01:24:54,144 --> 01:24:56,704
This is the great joke of social engineering

1668
01:24:57,216 --> 01:24:59,008
Where they made mean trendy

1669
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:05,152
The new religion and now people

1670
01:25:05,408 --> 01:25:08,736
With the new

1671
01:25:08,992 --> 01:25:10,016
Until they only

1672
01:25:12,064 --> 01:25:14,368
Puritanical

1673
01:25:17,184 --> 01:25:18,208
Surface

1674
01:25:27,424 --> 01:25:29,728
The door up to whatever

1675
01:25:29,984 --> 01:25:30,752
They want

1676
01:25:31,776 --> 01:25:36,384
It's Politically Incorrect

1677
01:25:36,896 --> 01:25:40,736
Let your washer out the window

1678
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:52,256
Six-years-old across the street

1679
01:25:59,424 --> 01:26:00,448
So

1680
01:26:00,704 --> 01:26:02,240
Spoiler alert you talked about going to the

1681
01:26:02,496 --> 01:26:08,640
Sparks are like 4 minutes you really lost the thread in terms of complaining about the ACLU

1682
01:26:08,896 --> 01:26:12,736
11 year old kid who got arrested for

1683
01:26:12,992 --> 01:26:15,296
Authorities

1684
01:26:15,552 --> 01:26:16,576
Oh that was

1685
01:26:16,832 --> 01:26:21,184
There were neighbors who thought that the parents weren't

1686
01:26:23,232 --> 01:26:25,280
The kid was always home alone

1687
01:26:25,536 --> 01:26:28,864
Since I got off work much later zielinski kit

1688
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:31,936
Nosy neighbors

1689
01:26:32,192 --> 01:26:36,544
I believe I looked into it and I think it is like

1690
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:37,824
Guys magic f****** business

1691
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:41,920
Their motivation was protecting this child cuz they're concerned with

1692
01:26:43,968 --> 01:26:47,808
For the time that the parents were or didn't have access to a bathroom who's locked out of his house

1693
01:26:48,576 --> 01:26:49,600
So

1694
01:26:49,856 --> 01:26:51,904
So

1695
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:53,952
To make the matters worse the mom

1696
01:26:54,208 --> 01:26:56,768
By whatever she was being questioned about it was like

1697
01:26:57,024 --> 01:27:01,376
The officers themselves said he had a big yard he could have gone to the bathroom on it

1698
01:27:02,912 --> 01:27:09,056
The right you know I left the dog alone in the house

1699
01:27:09,312 --> 01:27:14,432
Be super

1700
01:27:14,944 --> 01:27:19,296
Into what people are complaining about

1701
01:27:22,112 --> 01:27:24,416
Bishop had the kids taken away and they did get them back

1702
01:27:24,672 --> 01:27:26,208
Yeah it was it was a f*****-up

1703
01:27:26,464 --> 01:27:29,024
Situation a little bit of talking about

1704
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:31,328
He's saying that it is like this big regret

1705
01:27:31,584 --> 01:27:37,472
Destroy the family

1706
01:27:37,728 --> 01:27:39,520
Always reason why

1707
01:27:39,776 --> 01:27:40,800
Dinner

1708
01:27:45,664 --> 01:27:49,504
A right-winger tells me one of those

1709
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:50,272
Anecdote

1710
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:51,808
If you look in

1711
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:55,392
Google it

1712
01:27:55,648 --> 01:27:57,184
All the sudden you start finding

1713
01:28:00,768 --> 01:28:02,048
Yeah

1714
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:03,840
But in reality

1715
01:28:04,096 --> 01:28:07,936
Unfortunately there are a number of people on the left to do that too but

1716
01:28:08,192 --> 01:28:09,728
If usually not as a like

1717
01:28:09,984 --> 01:28:10,496
Obvious

1718
01:28:10,752 --> 01:28:12,288
Or at least not as awful

1719
01:28:12,544 --> 01:28:16,896
Yeah I have their agenda is generally to create more

1720
01:28:17,408 --> 01:28:22,272
Good I feel bad for you lies and propaganda but it's not

1721
01:28:22,528 --> 01:28:23,296
Usually like

1722
01:28:23,552 --> 01:28:26,624
It's very dark

1723
01:28:27,392 --> 01:28:28,416
Yeah if

1724
01:28:28,928 --> 01:28:30,208
Sort of left-wing

1725
01:28:30,464 --> 01:28:30,976
Do you mean now

1726
01:28:31,232 --> 01:28:32,768
Left-wing

1727
01:28:33,024 --> 01:28:33,536
Duboku

1728
01:28:33,792 --> 01:28:35,584
When he got his way and Trump was elected

1729
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:38,912
Let's let's say like if entire

1730
01:28:39,168 --> 01:28:39,680
Congress

1731
01:28:39,936 --> 01:28:40,448
Is Republican

1732
01:28:41,472 --> 01:28:43,520
It's okay it's okay

1733
01:28:43,776 --> 01:28:44,544
Well there'll

1734
01:28:45,824 --> 01:28:47,360
There are saving grace is

1735
01:28:47,616 --> 01:28:48,128
These people

1736
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:51,200
By virtue virtual of what they believe

1737
01:28:51,456 --> 01:28:54,016
They are already revealing themselves

1738
01:28:54,528 --> 01:28:55,552
Dumb

1739
01:28:55,808 --> 01:28:57,856
So again I are saving grace

1740
01:28:58,112 --> 01:28:59,648
Is we are being run by

1741
01:28:59,904 --> 01:29:00,928
People to dumb

1742
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:02,976
To enact the dumb s*** they won

1743
01:29:03,488 --> 01:29:04,512
There is that like

1744
01:29:04,768 --> 01:29:08,352
That that upper right quadrant of the evil stupid

1745
01:29:08,608 --> 01:29:09,376
Yep

1746
01:29:09,632 --> 01:29:14,240
Yeah g herbo

1747
01:29:14,752 --> 01:29:15,264
Yeah yeah

1748
01:29:15,776 --> 01:29:19,360
But today is it like if you take someone like Keith Olbermann

1749
01:29:19,616 --> 01:29:21,408
Who is kind of

1750
01:29:21,664 --> 01:29:22,432
Left-wing propaganda

1751
01:29:22,688 --> 01:29:24,992
You could possibly

1752
01:29:25,504 --> 01:29:27,296
If you got his way

1753
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:32,160
You better have more social programs but might be better safety nets for people

1754
01:29:32,416 --> 01:29:38,560
Have you built that on Ally I'm not super thrilled with that I don't think that's good but the end result is way better than us having

1755
01:29:39,072 --> 01:29:40,864
Mentally decaying

1756
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:42,400
Bigoted as our president

1757
01:29:43,168 --> 01:29:43,680
That is

1758
01:29:43,936 --> 01:29:45,472
Probably for the better

1759
01:29:46,496 --> 01:29:47,776
Totally scaling back

1760
01:29:48,032 --> 01:29:49,568
I mean every single day

1761
01:29:49,824 --> 01:29:50,336
New f******

1762
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:53,920
Anyway

1763
01:29:54,176 --> 01:29:55,968
Perfect summation of

1764
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:57,248
World we live in

1765
01:29:58,016 --> 01:29:59,808
Me Clear My Throat

1766
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:01,344
It's a new fuc

1767
01:30:02,112 --> 01:30:06,208
The new thing rolled back that's a school lunch program for going away

1768
01:30:09,536 --> 01:30:11,584
Let's privatize it

1769
01:30:12,864 --> 01:30:13,888
I swear to you

1770
01:30:14,656 --> 01:30:15,424
This is the

1771
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:16,960
Ultimate frustration

1772
01:30:17,728 --> 01:30:18,496
I would

1773
01:30:18,752 --> 01:30:20,544
Absolutely live with

1774
01:30:21,824 --> 01:30:24,896
If he had the most aggressive anti-climb

1775
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:28,736
I know we've been over this

1776
01:30:28,992 --> 01:30:30,272
Because then the human race would

1777
01:30:30,528 --> 01:30:31,808
Continue

1778
01:30:32,064 --> 01:30:32,832
Incorrectly

1779
01:30:33,088 --> 01:30:39,232
Global Society

1780
01:30:39,744 --> 01:30:42,304
Yeah I know

1781
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:44,096
Stay Rihanna

1782
01:30:44,352 --> 01:30:45,376
A boy

1783
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:47,680
3

1784
01:30:48,192 --> 01:30:50,752
All right so now it's time for us to get to the phone

1785
01:30:54,848 --> 01:30:56,896
Policy policy

1786
01:30:59,456 --> 01:31:00,992
Battle Cry

1787
01:31:01,504 --> 01:31:02,784
It's very bad

1788
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:04,320
If it ends on that kind of

1789
01:31:04,576 --> 01:31:06,112
Minor key in the very bad battle

1790
01:31:09,184 --> 01:31:10,464
June 24th

1791
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:13,280
Episode

1792
01:31:13,536 --> 01:31:14,560
Chaka block

1793
01:31:15,072 --> 01:31:16,608
We'll talk about how

1794
01:31:16,864 --> 01:31:21,216
It's evil and wrong the people are trying to get the Confederate flag taken down

1795
01:31:21,472 --> 01:31:21,984
Places

1796
01:31:23,008 --> 01:31:23,520
You if you think

1797
01:31:24,032 --> 01:31:26,080
Their argument is that the free speech

1798
01:31:28,896 --> 01:31:32,992
I don't I don't want to have that argument cuz I don't care

1799
01:31:34,528 --> 01:31:38,368
I don't care if someone has a Confederate flag in their car in their house

1800
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:42,976
Publicly I don't really even care but if it's like a State Building or something like that

1801
01:31:43,232 --> 01:31:44,256
Play very much care

1802
01:31:44,768 --> 01:31:45,280
That's bad

1803
01:31:45,536 --> 01:31:47,072
If you're if you're

1804
01:31:48,608 --> 01:31:50,400
If you're not a horrifying

1805
01:31:51,424 --> 01:31:54,752
No I don't even try to answer that

1806
01:31:55,008 --> 01:31:56,288
Subscribe to that

1807
01:31:58,336 --> 01:31:58,848
You doing it

1808
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:08,832
Things that you could point

1809
01:32:09,088 --> 01:32:11,904
There's a foot that is the smokescreen argument for

1810
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:17,024
I want my racism to be left to celebrate Old Dixie

1811
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:18,304
Who are

1812
01:32:18,816 --> 01:32:19,328
Huge racist

1813
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:22,144
Yeah but that's not all of them

1814
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:27,264
And I don't think it's right to ban flag

1815
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:28,800
To have it up and say buildings

1816
01:32:29,056 --> 01:32:29,568
Some stuff like that

1817
01:32:29,824 --> 01:32:30,848
And I think

1818
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:32,384
For the most part

1819
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:34,176
That's the argument that people of had

1820
01:32:34,688 --> 01:32:35,968
I don't think there is

1821
01:32:36,736 --> 01:32:40,320
Legitimate or widespread group who is saying

1822
01:32:40,576 --> 01:32:42,368
Let's ban the flag.

1823
01:32:42,624 --> 01:32:43,904
Federate flag.

1824
01:32:44,416 --> 01:32:45,184
But

1825
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:46,464
Is Alex's possess

1826
01:32:47,488 --> 01:32:48,256
Alex pink

1827
01:32:48,512 --> 01:32:49,792
But that's what people are saying

1828
01:32:50,048 --> 01:32:53,120
It's the same thing with the Ten Commandments in front of the the court

1829
01:32:53,376 --> 01:32:54,144
Nobody wants

1830
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:56,704
Reading the 10 f******

1831
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:59,264
10 commandment but I don't want those

1832
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:00,032
In front of the

1833
01:33:00,288 --> 01:33:00,800
The courthouse

1834
01:33:01,056 --> 01:33:01,568
Because

1835
01:33:01,824 --> 01:33:02,336
Is not

1836
01:33:02,592 --> 01:33:04,896
Implies that it's Christian just

1837
01:33:05,152 --> 01:33:08,992
Exact time magic show

1838
01:33:09,248 --> 01:33:15,392
I was going to say Christian Okoye

1839
01:33:15,648 --> 01:33:19,232
Football Christian Okoye

1840
01:33:19,488 --> 01:33:20,000
Another team

1841
01:33:21,536 --> 01:33:22,048
Alex

1842
01:33:22,304 --> 01:33:23,328
Extrapolate

1843
01:33:24,864 --> 01:33:25,632
Alex

1844
01:33:28,192 --> 01:33:30,240
11 bayham

1845
01:33:30,752 --> 01:33:33,824
Alex on the 24th is going hog

1846
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:34,848
Wild

1847
01:33:35,104 --> 01:33:35,616
About this

1848
01:33:36,128 --> 01:33:37,408
He is just going on like

1849
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:39,712
Next on the American flag

1850
01:33:39,968 --> 01:33:40,480
Yep

1851
01:33:40,992 --> 01:33:41,760
So that's what he says

1852
01:33:42,016 --> 01:33:45,856
Like Rush Limbaugh thing

1853
01:33:46,624 --> 01:33:47,904
Here's what I'm zapopan.

1854
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:50,464
Mark Dice

1855
01:33:51,232 --> 01:33:52,000
One of the worst

1856
01:33:52,512 --> 01:33:53,536
Special Report

1857
01:33:53,792 --> 01:33:54,816
He goes out

1858
01:33:55,584 --> 01:33:57,120
And does one of his Fieldpiece

1859
01:33:57,376 --> 01:33:58,912
We talked about Mark Dice before

1860
01:33:59,424 --> 01:34:00,960
Alyssa

1861
01:34:01,216 --> 01:34:05,312
You are

1862
01:34:05,568 --> 01:34:07,872
Reports before

1863
01:34:08,128 --> 01:34:10,432
He's very ineffective as a man of the sea

1864
01:34:12,224 --> 01:34:14,528
I think has some kind of

1865
01:34:15,296 --> 01:34:16,832
Personality disorder

1866
01:34:17,088 --> 01:34:18,368
He's unable

1867
01:34:18,624 --> 01:34:22,976
He's unable to make eye contact with people as he's interviewing them on the street he looks past

1868
01:34:24,512 --> 01:34:25,792
Upset

1869
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:29,120
It's it's not fun

1870
01:34:29,632 --> 01:34:30,400
It's not good

1871
01:34:32,192 --> 01:34:38,336
Alex Jones sent Mark Dice out

1872
01:34:38,592 --> 01:34:39,104
Around with a video

1873
01:34:39,616 --> 01:34:43,200
It's possible to get people to sign

1874
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:51,904
People on the beach

1875
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:53,184
Society

1876
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:55,232
Trying to get a new flag

1877
01:34:55,744 --> 01:34:57,792
Get rid of the Old Glory

1878
01:34:58,048 --> 01:34:59,072
And get a new flag

1879
01:34:59,328 --> 01:35:01,888
In order in honor of the New World Order

1880
01:35:02,656 --> 01:35:03,680
Arabi a pyramid

1881
01:35:04,192 --> 01:35:06,752
He's buried with Hulk Hogan

1882
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:08,288
No I wish

1883
01:35:08,544 --> 01:35:14,688
Too sweet I know it's not that one it's like I'm at the back of the dollar bill the All-Seeing Eye on the pier

1884
01:35:14,944 --> 01:35:16,992
Pyramid

1885
01:35:18,016 --> 01:35:18,784
Chico's hours

1886
01:35:19,296 --> 01:35:20,576
And does this video

1887
01:35:21,088 --> 01:35:22,880
Alex posted on Infowars

1888
01:35:23,648 --> 01:35:25,952
Drudgereport link to the video

1889
01:35:26,208 --> 01:35:27,744
Epic

1890
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:28,512
Alex

1891
01:35:28,768 --> 01:35:30,048
On Infowars

1892
01:35:30,304 --> 01:35:31,328
Starts reporting

1893
01:35:31,584 --> 01:35:33,120
But people are calling

1894
01:35:33,376 --> 01:35:34,912
For the American flag to be banned

1895
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:37,216
She has made

1896
01:35:37,728 --> 01:35:41,312
Loop of b******* it's a complete Ouroboros supplies

1897
01:35:41,568 --> 01:35:43,872
Is insane to see it like

1898
01:35:44,128 --> 01:35:46,688
Just literally this is exactly what's going on

1899
01:35:46,944 --> 01:35:47,456
It's amazing

1900
01:35:47,712 --> 01:35:50,272
They're making the news they're commenting on the news

1901
01:35:50,528 --> 01:35:52,064
And then they're commenting

1902
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:53,088
Becomes news

1903
01:35:53,344 --> 01:35:59,488
Exactly model of right-wing at the at the bottom

1904
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,280
There is no like

1905
01:36:01,536 --> 01:36:03,840
There is nobody who's asking for the flag

1906
01:36:04,096 --> 01:36:04,608
To be bad

1907
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:07,168
There is only Mark Dice on the street

1908
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:08,704
That is all there is

1909
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:12,032
And now we're going to listen to Mark dice's report

1910
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:13,824
And I want to tell you

1911
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:20,224
I'm going to pause it a couple points because I have taken notes about all of these people that he goes and talks to

1912
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:22,528
Excellent and it's good for him

1913
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:24,320
Here we go

1914
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:28,416
Cheerios that report

1915
01:36:28,672 --> 01:36:29,952
From Mark Dice

1916
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:36,864
American flag

1917
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:44,800
Is first

1918
01:36:45,056 --> 01:36:47,616
First person is already against him

1919
01:36:47,872 --> 01:36:52,480
No I'm out of here

1920
01:36:52,736 --> 01:36:55,552
Even Fox News edited that guy out

1921
01:36:55,808 --> 01:37:00,928
Put it in the middle somewhere

1922
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:07,584
Make a funny face to the camera

1923
01:37:17,824 --> 01:37:18,336
Drunk

1924
01:37:20,640 --> 01:37:23,712
He's not staggering around Alex Jones style drunk

1925
01:37:24,224 --> 01:37:26,016
He's having a good time out there on the beach

1926
01:37:26,272 --> 01:37:27,552
Stanford football

1927
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:31,648
He's looking for his

1928
01:37:32,416 --> 01:37:35,232
Nevermind I don't want to ruin it but he also does not send

1929
01:37:36,512 --> 01:37:42,656
People are offended by the American flag

1930
01:37:42,912 --> 01:37:49,056
In racism

1931
01:37:49,312 --> 01:37:55,456
New American flag petition

1932
01:37:55,712 --> 01:38:00,320
New American flag

1933
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:07,232
When you don't want to sign something

1934
01:38:09,024 --> 01:38:13,632
You're a weirdo

1935
01:38:14,144 --> 01:38:15,168
Charges into the shop

1936
01:38:15,424 --> 01:38:17,216
His face is never shown

1937
01:38:17,472 --> 01:38:20,032
He comes in and he aggressively

1938
01:38:20,288 --> 01:38:21,056
Petition

1939
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:23,360
I don't think this is a real person

1940
01:38:23,616 --> 01:38:25,920
That's a meat like

1941
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:28,224
Exactly what I said

1942
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:29,248
To somebody who is

1943
01:38:32,064 --> 01:38:33,088
Do you want to help

1944
01:38:33,344 --> 01:38:34,368
Save the Dolphins

1945
01:38:35,136 --> 01:38:36,672
It sounds like a great idea

1946
01:38:37,952 --> 01:38:39,232
I'm going to leave

1947
01:38:39,488 --> 01:38:45,632
I got to go I have other non dolphin related activities to do right now

1948
01:38:45,888 --> 01:38:46,656
A good idea

1949
01:38:47,168 --> 01:38:47,680
Hugo

1950
01:38:47,936 --> 01:38:54,080
You're with you because you're weird

1951
01:38:55,616 --> 01:39:01,760
Why aren't you looking at

1952
01:39:02,016 --> 01:39:02,784
Oh my God

1953
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:04,320
Scares me so much

1954
01:39:04,576 --> 01:39:06,112
He has so little charisma

1955
01:39:06,368 --> 01:39:12,512
Like I've said this about people like I don't know the Jerome corsi is of the world David Knight

1956
01:39:12,768 --> 01:39:13,536
I would I would

1957
01:39:13,792 --> 01:39:14,816
F****** go to

1958
01:39:15,072 --> 01:39:17,632
Across the world in a balloon

1959
01:39:17,888 --> 01:39:23,264
Before I said.

1960
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:25,312
What's a metaphor

1961
01:39:25,568 --> 01:39:28,128
So here comes the guy who who just charges in

1962
01:39:28,896 --> 01:39:35,040
So you think you can understand a lot of people are offended by the

1963
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:42,464
American flag imperialism

1964
01:39:48,608 --> 01:39:54,752
Think it's about time we do that when she agree maybe something with an All-Seeing Eye and a pyramid

1965
01:39:55,008 --> 01:39:56,544
So as he's trying to get lucky

1966
01:39:57,568 --> 01:40:00,640
As he's trying to describe what the new flag would look like the guys

1967
01:40:00,896 --> 01:40:01,408
Just walks off

1968
01:40:03,456 --> 01:40:05,760
Signs Aries man

1969
01:40:08,064 --> 01:40:14,208
Just something to represent the New World Order

1970
01:40:14,464 --> 01:40:17,280
2

1971
01:40:19,072 --> 01:40:20,864
This guy I don't know if he speaks

1972
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:26,752
He doesn't seem to register awareness of the things

1973
01:40:27,008 --> 01:40:30,336
That Mark Dice is saying he's wearing like a muscle tee

1974
01:40:30,592 --> 01:40:31,616
I need to sort of like

1975
01:40:32,384 --> 01:40:34,944
Is this little looking at him confused

1976
01:40:35,456 --> 01:40:38,784
Signs of saying n word

1977
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:45,184
I will admit I also like the reaction of the guy who signs it and then just says f*** yeah and then walks away

1978
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:51,584
Whatever man

1979
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:54,400
Yeah I might do that

1980
01:40:54,656 --> 01:40:58,752
He's just talking to this guy who doesn't say a word

1981
01:40:59,008 --> 01:40:59,776
About Alex

1982
01:41:00,032 --> 01:41:00,544
Goes on a

1983
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:01,312
F******

1984
01:41:01,824 --> 01:41:03,872
Just teased off on this guy with a muscle shirt

1985
01:41:04,896 --> 01:41:11,040
American flag over the capitol to signify the new world order but we just needed some more signatures thanks for support

1986
01:41:11,296 --> 01:41:14,880
American flag Confederate flag

1987
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:20,512
Modern Talking

1988
01:41:21,024 --> 01:41:22,304
Wendy's

1989
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:24,096
101 variants

1990
01:41:24,352 --> 01:41:26,912
Those how to act

1991
01:41:28,704 --> 01:41:31,776
Guys walking around acting top

1992
01:41:32,288 --> 01:41:33,568
And they don't want

1993
01:41:33,824 --> 01:41:35,104
To know what's going on

1994
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:37,408
I just want to look cool. Other people

1995
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:40,224
And put on a front

1996
01:41:41,504 --> 01:41:43,552
These guys eyes every time

1997
01:41:45,088 --> 01:41:46,624
Finish up this week looking

1998
01:41:47,648 --> 01:41:48,672
It's up with that

1999
01:41:49,696 --> 01:41:51,232
Do you think those guys white or not

2000
01:41:51,744 --> 01:41:54,560
Go with

Bingo

2003
01:42:02,752 --> 01:42:06,336
Prayers to the old American flag and

2004
01:42:06,592 --> 01:42:09,152
Forgot to put up a new American flag

2005
01:42:09,408 --> 01:42:15,552
Over the capitol to signify the new world order but we just needed some more signatures thanks for supporting the new American flag

2006
01:42:15,808 --> 01:42:20,416
Confederate flag in a lot of cities to end the era of racism in

2007
01:42:20,672 --> 01:42:21,184
Who cares

2008
01:42:22,464 --> 01:42:28,608
It is so boring let me walk you through

2009
01:42:28,864 --> 01:42:30,400
The American flag

2010
01:42:30,656 --> 01:42:31,424
I like

2011
01:42:31,936 --> 01:42:32,704
The American

2012
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:33,984

Person he talks to is a really nice girl

2015
01:42:42,176 --> 01:42:42,944
Who

2016
01:42:43,456 --> 01:42:47,552
I think she's just super excitable and happy

2017
01:42:47,808 --> 01:42:48,320
Oh

2018
01:42:50,112 --> 01:42:53,184

One of them is a chubby dude

2022
01:43:09,312 --> 01:43:10,336
Probably

2023
01:43:10,592 --> 01:43:11,616
Because I think you're tired

2024
01:43:12,384 --> 01:43:14,688
It's him and another guy

2025
01:43:14,944 --> 01:43:16,224
They're too skateboard dudes

2026
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:19,296

20ft outside of any public

2035
01:43:47,456 --> 01:43:51,040
Who may or may not be high and they both sign it but they're also like

2036
01:43:51,296 --> 01:43:51,808
Whatever

2037

Said they talked to break it off is two dudes who are

2038
01:43:57,952 --> 01:43:58,464
Straight up

2039
01:43:58,976 --> 01:44:00,256
Baked out of their mind

2040
01:44:00,768 --> 01:44:04,096
And one of them is just

2041
01:44:04,352 --> 01:44:10,496
With his mouth slightly open

2042
01:44:10,752 --> 01:44:11,776
But has a backpack

2043
01:44:12,032 --> 01:44:15,104
What are you doing

2044
01:44:15,360 --> 01:44:16,128
Mark Dice

2045
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:21,760
I don't know what point you're making but if it is that people want

2046
01:44:22,016 --> 01:44:25,856
The American flag ban

2047
01:44:27,136 --> 01:44:28,160
Haven't most of them

2048
01:44:28,416 --> 01:44:29,696
People we've heard I've just been like

Who likes my group of two said absolutely not

2053
01:44:36,096 --> 01:44:37,376
The second guy said

01:44:38,144 --> 01:44:42,240
Is the lady who walked away

2055
01:44:43,776 --> 01:44:46,592
Everybody

2056
01:44:46,848 --> 01:44:51,200
Everybody else was ambivalent about it

2057
01:44:51,456 --> 01:44:52,992
You're a random dude asking

2058
01:44:54,528 --> 01:44:55,296

Answer

2066
01:45:08,352 --> 01:45:09,888
If

2067
01:45:10,144 --> 01:45:11,424
It's just a bullshiter

2068
01:45:13,728 --> 01:45:14,752
Prank

2069
01:45:15,008 --> 01:45:16,800
It's not a prank there is nothing here

2070
01:45:17,056 --> 01:45:18,592
Cuz if you sign that

2071
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:19,872
Then

2072
01:45:20,128 --> 01:45:20,640
So what

2073
01:45:21,152 --> 01:45:26,528
If you a violently politely sign that for us if you want the American flag ban

2074
01:45:26,784 --> 01:45:28,832
That just proves that you're a decent

2075
01:45:29,088 --> 01:45:30,624
Person who doesn't know how to

2076
01:45:31,136 --> 01:45:33,696
Have boundaries here like the old just like

2077
01:45:33,952 --> 01:45:35,488
Like the easiest way to get

2078
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:36,512
To go away

2079
01:45:37,024 --> 01:45:37,536
Zionism

2080
01:45:38,048 --> 01:45:42,144
Exactly come from it because that's such a

2081
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:42,912
Wild

2082
01:45:44,448 --> 01:45:45,216
I've signed

2083
01:45:45,472 --> 01:45:48,544
Hundreds of things I don't agree with

2084
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:50,592
Matter there's no

2085
01:45:51,104 --> 01:45:52,384
Possibility of that

2086
01:45:52,640 --> 01:45:54,688
Like even if you hate America

2087
01:45:55,456 --> 01:45:55,968
Which is

2088
01:45:56,736 --> 01:46:00,832
You're not you're not going to actually

2089
01:46:02,624 --> 01:46:03,904
Genuinely

2090
01:46:04,928 --> 01:46:06,720
Regardless of Americas

2091
01:46:06,976 --> 01:46:07,744
Horrific Acts

2092
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:08,512
Throughout

2093
01:46:09,024 --> 01:46:09,536
Are exist

2094
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:15,424
Stars and Stripes really is a symbol of what it is

2095
01:46:15,680 --> 01:46:16,448
Like

2096
01:46:16,704 --> 01:46:17,728
Play Fire Woman

2097
01:46:17,984 --> 01:46:21,568
Yeah it is everything that America wishes it could

2098
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:25,664
It is all of the all of the states represent

2099
01:46:26,176 --> 01:46:27,200
It is all of us

2100
01:46:27,456 --> 01:46:27,968
Together

2101
01:46:28,224 --> 01:46:30,016
It is built around that idea

2102
01:46:30,272 --> 01:46:31,040
Of either we hang

2103
01:46:31,296 --> 01:46:31,808
Together are we

2104
01:46:32,832 --> 01:46:36,160
Alex Jones quotes

2105
01:46:36,672 --> 01:46:40,512
Okay alright so actually

2106
01:46:41,024 --> 01:46:45,376
Will Shakespeare we're coming towards the end

2107
01:46:45,632 --> 01:46:48,192
Hour-and-a-half of the show

2108
01:46:48,448 --> 01:46:51,264
Yeah he has an interview with this guy named Lionel

2109
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:52,800
One name like Madonna

2110
01:46:53,056 --> 01:46:53,568
Lionel

2111
01:46:54,336 --> 01:46:56,128
Land

2112
01:46:56,896 --> 01:46:59,456
He is a fast-talking New York do

2113
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:02,784
Is it something else

2114
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:04,576
The show before

2115
01:47:06,624 --> 01:47:10,208
I strongly disagree with him about almost everything

2116
01:47:10,464 --> 01:47:12,512
But I don't hate hearing him talk

2117
01:47:12,768 --> 01:47:14,304
Gas

2118
01:47:17,376 --> 01:47:19,936
I would be in a hot air balloon across the world

2119
01:47:20,192 --> 01:47:21,472
Take a short trip

2120
01:47:28,128 --> 01:47:28,896
Miles down the road

2121
01:47:29,408 --> 01:47:30,944
Maybe

2122
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:32,480
Depends on the speed limit

2123
01:47:32,736 --> 01:47:35,040
Yes possibly

2124
01:47:38,624 --> 01:47:42,208
So they have a really long interview

2125
01:47:42,464 --> 01:47:44,512
Where

2126
01:47:46,304 --> 01:47:47,072
I caught out

2127
01:47:47,328 --> 01:47:47,840
So much

2128
01:47:48,352 --> 01:47:49,120
So repetitive

2129
01:47:51,424 --> 01:47:52,192
At one point

2130
01:47:52,704 --> 01:47:53,472
Lionel

2131
01:47:53,984 --> 01:47:56,288
Starts describing what his plan would be

2132
01:47:56,544 --> 01:47:57,312
If he was going to

2133
01:47:57,568 --> 01:47:58,336
Destroy our country

2134
01:47:59,872 --> 01:48:01,408
Interesting

2135
01:48:01,664 --> 01:48:04,224
Already cuz two years later

2136
01:48:04,992 --> 01:48:07,296
See if you see any similarities to what's going on

2137
01:48:08,064 --> 01:48:10,368
I'm going to destroy this country

2138
01:48:10,624 --> 01:48:11,392
Here's what I would do

2139
01:48:11,904 --> 01:48:12,928
Informal

2140
01:48:13,184 --> 01:48:15,744
I would distract the bread and circuses

2141
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:17,792
The people more than ever

2142
01:48:19,328 --> 01:48:22,656
I would have a foundation for much of the economy

2143
01:48:22,912 --> 01:48:28,032
This tissue thin veneer of cotton candy

2144
01:48:28,288 --> 01:48:29,312
The derivative

2145
01:48:29,568 --> 01:48:32,128
You say what

2146
01:48:32,384 --> 01:48:37,504
Dollars

2147
01:48:38,528 --> 01:48:40,064
Alex of American Express

2148
01:48:40,832 --> 01:48:46,976
Ronald Reagan

2149
01:48:50,048 --> 01:48:56,192
Accidentally

2150
01:48:57,984 --> 01:49:00,544
I can't believe it 40 episodes in

2151
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:05,920
I don't know what that is

2152
01:49:07,712 --> 01:49:08,224
Perfect

2153
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:12,064
Trump rally rally Trump rally

2154
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:15,904
Weather

2155
01:49:16,160 --> 01:49:17,440
God dammit this man

2156
01:49:18,464 --> 01:49:20,512
But he's saying it is this what the globalist are doing

2157
01:49:20,768 --> 01:49:22,560
Not what

2158
01:49:22,816 --> 01:49:23,584
Unless

2159
01:49:25,120 --> 01:49:26,144
Recently come out

2160
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:26,912
As an international

2161
01:49:27,424 --> 01:49:30,240
Well Alex's

2162
01:49:31,520 --> 01:49:32,800
F*** off a battery

2163
01:49:33,056 --> 01:49:36,640
Not really

2164
01:49:36,896 --> 01:49:37,920
He's a good guy

2165
01:49:38,176 --> 01:49:38,944
Ignore

2166
01:49:39,200 --> 01:49:40,992
He's just saying that because

2167
01:49:41,504 --> 01:49:42,272
He has to

2168
01:49:46,624 --> 01:49:49,952
Impenetrable

2169
01:49:50,208 --> 01:49:52,000
Are never going to be Puerto Rico

2170
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:59,424
Iceland or Portugal where is the United States

2171
01:50:00,448 --> 01:50:04,544
Strange language for vaccine deny Airshow

2172
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:10,944
You would that is exactly what Trump is doing with us we're going to renegotiate these deals because

2173
01:50:11,200 --> 01:50:12,224
Go to be immune from Alta

2174
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:16,064
Exceptionalism

2175
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:17,088
Perfect summation

2176
01:50:17,344 --> 01:50:19,392
Like if I were going to destroy the

2177
01:50:20,160 --> 01:50:20,672
Fireline

2178
01:50:23,744 --> 01:50:28,608
Because that guys f****** on it another phase to this

2179
01:50:28,864 --> 01:50:30,912
Obstruction of

2180
01:50:31,424 --> 01:50:35,264
I'm a big fan of it

2181
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:36,032
Mission where we had

2182
01:50:38,592 --> 01:50:43,968
Split up into

2183
01:50:44,736 --> 01:50:50,880
And then we're going to confuse people

2184
01:50:51,136 --> 01:50:52,416
Settle for something

2185
01:50:52,672 --> 01:50:58,816
A full lemon juice

2186
01:50:59,072 --> 01:51:01,632
Flagger battleflag controversy

2187
01:51:04,192 --> 01:51:10,336
What else about the globalist in terms of externalizing their plan

2188
01:51:10,592 --> 01:51:12,640
Literally

2189
01:51:12,896 --> 01:51:18,016
Like we've already Illustrated year this idea that they took

2190
01:51:19,552 --> 01:51:20,832
The

2191
01:51:21,088 --> 01:51:22,112
For a cross-country trip

2192
01:51:22,368 --> 01:51:25,184
I want to know where he's at he would talk to us

2193
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:26,208
That's the dude

2194
01:51:27,744 --> 01:51:29,280
We've already shown this

2195
01:51:29,536 --> 01:51:35,680
Fake story about banning the American flag going from an Infowars video to an article on Infowars

2196
01:51:35,936 --> 01:51:38,752
Garage to something it is reported on the Alex Jones Show

2197
01:51:39,008 --> 01:51:41,568
That is creating fake outrage

2198
01:51:44,128 --> 01:51:48,224
Now he hears the bulshit first

2199
01:51:48,480 --> 01:51:50,016
Sing me out right here in a

2200
01:51:50,528 --> 01:51:52,832
Because what he's talking about is

2201
01:51:53,088 --> 01:51:53,600
People who are

2202
01:51:53,856 --> 01:51:54,624
Legitimately offended

2203
01:51:55,136 --> 01:51:55,648
Bye

2204
01:51:56,160 --> 01:51:57,184
In this case

2205
01:51:57,952 --> 01:51:58,976
The Confederate flag

2206
01:51:59,744 --> 01:52:02,048
Which is denying people their feelings

2207
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:05,120
About the history of brutal

2208
01:52:05,376 --> 01:52:05,888
Racing

2209
01:52:06,912 --> 01:52:10,752
So that part is what he's really talking about when he said something

2210
01:52:11,008 --> 01:52:12,288
Give people something to be mad about

2211
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:13,824
It is

2212
01:52:14,592 --> 01:52:15,616
A complete

2213
01:52:15,872 --> 01:52:22,016
Perfect demonstration I wanted to bring this up earlier I can't remember which Cliff it was in the hole.

2214
01:52:22,528 --> 01:52:23,040
Has the eggs

2215
01:52:23,296 --> 01:52:28,672
Jackson history of brutal racism

2216
01:52:29,440 --> 01:52:33,280
You're not wrong but you're off on the wrong the wrong direction

2217
01:52:33,536 --> 01:52:35,584
What I'm saying is we need to ban the American

2218
01:52:37,632 --> 01:52:38,912
It's not about that

2219
01:52:41,216 --> 01:52:44,288
He's talking about all of these politics

2220
01:52:44,544 --> 01:52:45,056
Kinds of things

2221
01:52:45,312 --> 01:52:47,616
All these ideas about trendies in

2222
01:52:47,872 --> 01:52:49,152
Wedding dresses with mustache

2223
01:52:49,408 --> 01:52:52,736
All of the stuff is parceled within that it is

2224
01:52:52,992 --> 01:52:55,040
A perfect expression of this

2225
01:52:55,296 --> 01:52:58,112
Angry male privilege

2226
01:52:58,368 --> 01:52:58,880
Expresses

2227
01:52:59,136 --> 01:53:00,672
Everything that is like

2228
01:53:00,928 --> 01:53:02,208
Black lives matter

2229
01:53:02,464 --> 01:53:05,280
Globalist

2230
01:53:05,536 --> 01:53:06,048
Cityalight

2231
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:09,888
If this anytime that you're pissed off about these things

2232
01:53:10,144 --> 01:53:15,776
Divide and conquer strategies so if you care about the Confederate

2233
01:53:16,032 --> 01:53:21,408
Or if you care about is he even says I remember which episode was in one of the other ones

2234
01:53:21,664 --> 01:53:24,224
We're not covering please talking about like

2235
01:53:24,480 --> 01:53:25,248
Yeah sure

2236
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:27,296
Cop shoots guy every week

2237
01:53:27,552 --> 01:53:29,856
I see articles about them guys too

2238
01:53:31,392 --> 01:53:34,720
Hope you're not right right understanding

2239
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:42,144
Shooting white guys too

2240
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:43,424
You can be against

2241
01:53:43,680 --> 01:53:46,496
Both the point of them the fact that he

2242
01:53:48,544 --> 01:53:49,056
Is that

2243
01:53:53,664 --> 01:53:54,688
Long history

2244
01:53:55,200 --> 01:53:56,480
And it is something that is

2245
01:53:57,504 --> 01:53:58,016
Targeted

2246
01:53:59,296 --> 01:54:01,344
That it is Paramount

2247
01:54:01,600 --> 01:54:03,648
Isaac

2248
01:54:04,672 --> 01:54:06,976
Definitely says more about your priorities

2249
01:54:07,232 --> 01:54:08,768
When you're mad

2250
01:54:09,024 --> 01:54:11,072
People who are complaining about cops

2251
01:54:11,328 --> 01:54:15,680
Shooting black people because no one likes

2252
01:54:15,936 --> 01:54:17,728
What if we had a Father's Day

2253
01:54:17,984 --> 01:54:24,128
Your Mother's Day can always always about celebrating women like what if what if we had a white history

2254
01:54:27,968 --> 01:54:28,736
But nobody talks about

2255
01:54:30,784 --> 01:54:34,880
It's not missing it's missing the mark and they frame it as

2256
01:54:35,648 --> 01:54:37,440
Society is confused

2257
01:54:37,952 --> 01:54:44,096
Society is being tricked by this divide-and-conquer game that's the way they can Elevate themselves in the same way

2258
01:54:44,352 --> 01:54:45,376
Play the Daleks inoculate

2259
01:54:45,632 --> 01:54:47,168
It's all from that doctor metaphor

2260
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:53,824
By being like it's the global divide

2261
01:54:54,336 --> 01:54:56,128
I'm not against your point

2262
01:54:56,384 --> 01:54:59,456
I just think that it's so inconsequential compared to buy

2263
01:55:00,480 --> 01:55:00,992
This

2264
01:55:01,248 --> 01:55:04,064
The issues that I a very smart

2265
01:55:04,576 --> 01:55:05,856
White man who figured out

2266
01:55:07,136 --> 01:55:08,672
Right it's very stupid

2267
01:55:09,184 --> 01:55:09,952
It's a bummer

2268
01:55:11,488 --> 01:55:12,768
Pressing

2269
01:55:14,304 --> 01:55:15,328
It's one of those things

2270
01:55:16,096 --> 01:55:17,632
Over and over and over

2271
01:55:18,656 --> 01:55:19,424
VI

2272
01:55:19,680 --> 01:55:20,448
Idea that

2273
01:55:21,728 --> 01:55:22,752
They're doing

2274
01:55:23,008 --> 01:55:24,032
What weird

2275
01:55:24,544 --> 01:55:26,080
So we can do

2276
01:55:27,104 --> 01:55:29,408
Like this is just there doing it

2277
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:31,200
So we have to fight them

2278
01:55:31,712 --> 01:55:32,992
Which justifies

2279
01:55:34,016 --> 01:55:34,528
Yeah

2280
01:55:35,808 --> 01:55:37,344
Always it's always the

2281
01:55:37,600 --> 01:55:39,904
Playbook like oh they're playing the victim

2282
01:55:40,928 --> 01:55:42,464
Whenever they say that religious

2283
01:55:42,720 --> 01:55:43,232
Freedom is

2284
01:55:46,560 --> 01:55:48,864
It's exactly what your you're

2285
01:55:49,888 --> 01:55:50,656
F*** you

2286
01:55:52,448 --> 01:55:55,520
That's why we're so great because we don't play that game

2287
01:55:55,776 --> 01:55:56,800
Without

2288
01:55:57,312 --> 01:55:57,824
Screaming at the

2289
01:55:58,592 --> 01:55:59,104
No

2290
01:55:59,360 --> 01:55:59,872
So fresh

2291
01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:05,248
It's very obvious unless you have an agenda

2292
01:56:05,504 --> 01:56:09,088
But the reason you have that agenda

2293
01:56:09,344 --> 01:56:10,880
Him so you never really have to look

2294
01:56:13,440 --> 01:56:13,952
1

2295
01:56:14,208 --> 01:56:15,744
Is

2296
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:17,792
Lionel also being an a****** again

2297
01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:19,328
And this

2298
01:56:19,584 --> 01:56:20,096
Biscuits into

2299
01:56:20,352 --> 01:56:22,400
To the world being run by bankers

2300
01:56:23,168 --> 01:56:25,472
Which is

2301
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:28,032
Well

2302
01:56:28,288 --> 01:56:30,848
What episode of a let people understand

2303
01:56:31,104 --> 01:56:33,152
The what and who run the world

2304
01:56:36,224 --> 01:56:39,808
Very very at the top of the pyramid

2305
01:56:40,064 --> 01:56:40,832
Delete

2306
01:56:41,088 --> 01:56:45,440
Gangsters in Illinois

2307
01:56:45,952 --> 01:56:47,488
Yep you guys are being Jews

2308
01:56:50,048 --> 01:56:51,328
That's that's anti

2309
01:56:52,096 --> 01:56:58,240
When you say the banks are powerful yes they are but they don't

2310
01:56:58,496 --> 01:57:01,056
62 people own more than the bottom half

2311
01:57:02,336 --> 01:57:03,616
Entire world

2312
01:57:03,872 --> 01:57:04,640
The bankers

2313
01:57:05,408 --> 01:57:11,552
Why are politicians people with the 62 people that own

2314
01:57:11,808 --> 01:57:17,952
Call of the Wild Art old getting together around

2315
01:57:18,208 --> 01:57:19,488
Mark Zuckerberg

2316
01:57:19,744 --> 01:57:22,816
Some of them are people like that or like Mark Cuban

2317
01:57:23,328 --> 01:57:25,120
You're like he has billions of dollars

2318
01:57:25,632 --> 01:57:28,704
Right but like they're not Central bankers

2319
01:57:29,472 --> 01:57:31,264
Like you understand it's not like

2320
01:57:31,776 --> 01:57:33,824
No I bet argument Falls flat

2321
01:57:36,128 --> 01:57:37,664
I agree with you in that

2322
01:57:37,920 --> 01:57:38,944
Bankers here is

2323
01:57:39,200 --> 01:57:39,968
Is code for

2324
01:57:40,992 --> 01:57:42,272
100

2325
01:57:42,784 --> 01:57:46,624
Banksters this is purely do we not bleed

2326
01:57:46,880 --> 01:57:47,392
Like

2327
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:50,464
It's that whole thing

2328
01:57:51,744 --> 01:57:53,280
But

2329
01:57:53,792 --> 01:57:55,072
That there is again

2330
01:57:55,328 --> 01:57:56,608
This is an area where the

2331
01:57:56,864 --> 01:57:57,888
The kernel of Truth isn't

2332
01:57:58,912 --> 01:57:59,680
Because

2333
01:58:00,192 --> 01:58:00,704
Again

2334
01:58:01,728 --> 01:58:02,496
Bankers are

2335
01:58:02,752 --> 01:58:04,032
F****** everybody

2336
01:58:05,568 --> 01:58:06,336
That is a thing

2337
01:58:06,592 --> 01:58:12,224
Yeah but I still will not die

2338
01:58:12,736 --> 01:58:15,040
Because I know what they're saying

2339
01:58:15,296 --> 01:58:20,160
They're not saying the same things that you or I or someone

2340
01:58:22,976 --> 01:58:25,024
Right it's dog whistle e

2341
01:58:25,792 --> 01:58:31,424
It can't be taken outside of the context of all of these other thing all these other

2342
01:58:31,680 --> 01:58:32,960
All of these other like

2343
01:58:33,216 --> 01:58:35,776
It's insane I understand that I

2344
01:58:36,032 --> 01:58:36,800
Keep bringing up

2345
01:58:37,568 --> 01:58:42,944
Call

2346
01:58:44,480 --> 01:58:46,784
I have a pretty well but like literally

2347
01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:48,832
Multiple things that he says

2348
01:58:49,088 --> 01:58:50,624
Directly mirror

2349
01:58:51,904 --> 01:58:53,952
Parts from that very debunked

2350
01:58:54,208 --> 01:58:56,000
Anti-semitic book

2351
01:58:56,256 --> 01:58:57,024
It is

2352
01:58:57,536 --> 01:58:59,584
Clear that most of his velocity comes from

2353
01:58:59,840 --> 01:59:01,888
Understand

2354
01:59:04,192 --> 01:59:05,216
I think that is something

2355
01:59:06,240 --> 01:59:08,544
Most likely

2356
01:59:08,800 --> 01:59:09,824
We waffle

2357
01:59:10,080 --> 01:59:13,152
But most likely cuz I don't think

2358
01:59:13,408 --> 01:59:15,456
He's more of a and out now White

2359
01:59:15,712 --> 01:59:17,504
Nationalist

2360
01:59:18,528 --> 01:59:19,040
I agree

2361
01:59:19,552 --> 01:59:20,320
But like

2362
01:59:20,576 --> 01:59:23,136
Did the point I'm trying to make is that

2363
01:59:23,904 --> 01:59:25,696
Within that landscape

2364
01:59:25,952 --> 01:59:28,768
When you say something like the world is run by

2365
01:59:29,024 --> 01:59:31,584
A small group of elite banksters

2366
01:59:31,840 --> 01:59:33,632
You can't say that

2367
01:59:33,888 --> 01:59:34,656
Alex

2368
01:59:34,912 --> 01:59:36,704
Resoundingly agree with you

2369
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:38,496
Without it being taken

2370
01:59:39,008 --> 01:59:39,520
Heart

2371
01:59:39,776 --> 01:59:40,288
Of that

2372
01:59:40,544 --> 01:59:41,312
Cosmology

2373
01:59:41,568 --> 01:59:42,592
Part of that world

2374
01:59:42,848 --> 01:59:44,128
In philosophy

2375
01:59:44,640 --> 01:59:46,688
And anybody who listens to his show

2376
01:59:46,944 --> 01:59:52,064
Whether they're consciously aware of where they come from or not they know that philosophy

2377
01:59:52,320 --> 01:59:54,112
I want may hear stuff like this

2378
01:59:54,368 --> 01:59:56,928
Where there is a kernel of truth right help

2379
01:59:57,952 --> 01:59:59,232
Further into

2380
01:59:59,488 --> 02:00:04,096
Big part that's not true agree to Part B is this evil racist bulshit

2381
02:00:04,864 --> 02:00:05,632
So that's

2382
02:00:05,888 --> 02:00:07,168
Here's my

2383
02:00:07,424 --> 02:00:07,936
Here's my

2384
02:00:08,448 --> 02:00:08,960
Kind of

2385
02:00:09,472 --> 02:00:09,984
Question

2386
02:00:10,240 --> 02:00:11,520
Okay do you think

2387
02:00:12,032 --> 02:00:13,312
We could ever co-opt

2388
02:00:14,336 --> 02:00:14,848
Protocols

2389
02:00:18,432 --> 02:00:19,968
So so they're antisemita

2390
02:00:20,480 --> 02:00:20,992
Is

2391
02:00:21,248 --> 02:00:21,760
Still

2392
02:00:22,528 --> 02:00:24,832
Targeted towards those that idea of

2393
02:00:25,088 --> 02:00:25,856
The bankers who run the

2394
02:00:30,208 --> 02:00:36,352
There's more absolutely the whole fake media thing is a big part of it too and

2395
02:00:36,864 --> 02:00:37,376
If we could like

2396
02:00:37,632 --> 02:00:38,144
Just

2397
02:00:38,656 --> 02:00:39,936
Deep Earth crystallized

2398
02:00:40,448 --> 02:00:41,216
Into that I

2399
02:00:43,776 --> 02:00:44,288
I think

2400
02:00:45,312 --> 02:00:46,080
If we if

2401
02:00:46,336 --> 02:00:46,848
We really did it

2402
02:00:47,104 --> 02:00:48,384
PetSmart I don't like where you're going

2403
02:00:49,664 --> 02:00:51,712
We could on one particular

2404
02:00:52,224 --> 02:00:52,736
Situation

2405
02:00:53,248 --> 02:00:54,784
Utilize them as

2406
02:00:55,040 --> 02:00:57,088
A kind of enemy of my enemy is

2407
02:00:58,112 --> 02:01:01,184
So you like

2408
02:01:01,440 --> 02:01:03,744
Arcata man it's

2409
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,816
Chris they wouldn't work

2410
02:01:07,072 --> 02:01:13,216
I know that problem with Coraline I could never align with Alex for any common cause that we have

2411
02:01:14,752 --> 02:01:20,128
Yeah but you moved there is also that part

2412
02:01:20,640 --> 02:01:21,152
It says

2413
02:01:21,408 --> 02:01:22,176
We don't make

2414
02:01:22,688 --> 02:01:23,456
With our friends we make

2415
02:01:24,992 --> 02:01:26,272
Right

2416
02:01:26,528 --> 02:01:27,296
Is one situation

2417
02:01:28,064 --> 02:01:28,576
Where

2418
02:01:29,856 --> 02:01:30,624
God because

2419
02:01:31,136 --> 02:01:31,648
Because the

2420
02:01:31,904 --> 02:01:32,928
Conservative anger

2421
02:01:33,184 --> 02:01:33,952
Is towards

2422
02:01:34,208 --> 02:01:35,232
Like the tea party

2423
02:01:35,488 --> 02:01:36,512
Out of the bailout

2424
02:01:37,024 --> 02:01:38,816
And Barack Obama being black

2425
02:01:39,072 --> 02:01:39,840
Well yeah

2426
02:01:42,144 --> 02:01:42,656
Apps

2427
02:01:47,008 --> 02:01:47,776
The bailout

2428
02:01:48,032 --> 02:01:48,544
Mad about

2429
02:01:49,056 --> 02:01:49,568
Great

2430
02:01:49,824 --> 02:01:50,336
Now

2431
02:01:50,848 --> 02:01:51,872
Mad about a black

2432
02:01:53,408 --> 02:01:53,920
Is there a

2433
02:01:54,688 --> 02:01:55,456
No

2434
02:01:55,712 --> 02:01:56,736
There's not

2435
02:01:56,992 --> 02:02:01,344
I just have this hope you know why there's not you know why there's not it's the exact same thing

2436
02:02:03,136 --> 02:02:04,672
Agreement about the bailout

2437
02:02:05,184 --> 02:02:07,744
But agreement that we might have

2438
02:02:08,256 --> 02:02:10,048
Hair actually be in agreement

2439
02:02:10,304 --> 02:02:13,120
Because the reason that you have it is different than the reason

2440
02:02:14,400 --> 02:02:15,680
The reasoning

2441
02:02:17,216 --> 02:02:19,264
What got you to the point that you're at

2442
02:02:19,520 --> 02:02:21,568
Doesn't exist in the same cosmology is

2443
02:02:21,824 --> 02:02:23,104
What house they got to wear their

2444
02:02:23,360 --> 02:02:25,408
And because of that even if

2445
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:29,760
On the surface agree about an issue right

2446
02:02:30,272 --> 02:02:31,552
You absolutely don't

2447
02:02:31,808 --> 02:02:33,088
It is

2448
02:02:33,344 --> 02:02:34,624
I'm against the war in Iraq

2449
02:02:34,880 --> 02:02:36,160
You're against the war in Iraq

2450
02:02:36,416 --> 02:02:37,440
Taking it back a few years

2451
02:02:37,696 --> 02:02:40,512
Yeah our reasons for it might be different

2452
02:02:41,280 --> 02:02:43,072
And if my reason is

2453
02:02:43,584 --> 02:02:46,400
I'm against this war it's based on false pretenses

2454
02:02:46,656 --> 02:02:47,168
With no reason

2455
02:02:50,240 --> 02:02:50,752
Is

2456
02:02:51,264 --> 02:02:52,544
I'm against the war in Iraq

2457
02:02:52,800 --> 02:02:53,312
Because

2458
02:02:53,824 --> 02:02:59,968
A lizard person who's under the swag

2459
02:03:00,224 --> 02:03:03,552
Blah blah blah

2460
02:03:05,088 --> 02:03:07,904
Don't want people to die and that's good

2461
02:03:08,416 --> 02:03:09,696
Really

2462
02:03:09,952 --> 02:03:10,720
Work together

2463
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,560
I think your your analogy of

2464
02:03:14,816 --> 02:03:15,584
As propping up out

2465
02:03:15,840 --> 02:03:16,608
It's probably

2466
02:03:19,424 --> 02:03:19,936
The

2467
02:03:21,216 --> 02:03:22,496
The question their wood

2468
02:03:24,288 --> 02:03:24,800
Could we

2469
02:03:26,336 --> 02:03:26,848
Like

2470
02:03:27,360 --> 02:03:28,640
We don't agree on

2471
02:03:29,408 --> 02:03:29,920
But

2472
02:03:30,176 --> 02:03:32,224
Say we actually can agree

2473
02:03:33,248 --> 02:03:33,760
To break up the

2474
02:03:34,272 --> 02:03:34,784
Sure

2475
02:03:35,040 --> 02:03:41,184
Now I would sooner side with Bernie over on that van Alex Jones okay

2476
02:03:41,696 --> 02:03:42,976
I'm on the Bernie win

2477
02:03:43,488 --> 02:03:47,072
I don't know if you guys have ever listen to me talk

2478
02:03:49,120 --> 02:03:49,632
Politics

2479
02:03:49,888 --> 02:03:54,496
Borders on the the IRA more than anybody else your

2480
02:03:54,752 --> 02:03:59,104
Your past furnace furnace trying to catch up

2481
02:04:00,640 --> 02:04:02,432
Music

2482
02:04:02,944 --> 02:04:06,272
Where I would love to be able to use that

2483
02:04:06,784 --> 02:04:08,064
Anger towards the back

2484
02:04:08,576 --> 02:04:09,344
Even though the

2485
02:04:09,600 --> 02:04:10,368
Deep-seated heart of it

2486
02:04:10,624 --> 02:04:11,136
Is Aunt

2487
02:04:11,392 --> 02:04:11,904
Anti-semitism

2488
02:04:12,160 --> 02:04:13,952
Could I use that anger

2489
02:04:14,208 --> 02:04:14,976
And co-opted

2490
02:04:15,232 --> 02:04:15,744
To act

2491
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:16,512
Break up

2492
02:04:17,024 --> 02:04:17,792
My answer is no

2493
02:04:19,328 --> 02:04:21,120
You end up destroying yourself in the process

2494
02:04:21,632 --> 02:04:22,144
Yeah you're

2495
02:04:22,656 --> 02:04:27,264
All of your principles go away

2496
02:04:27,520 --> 02:04:28,800
You're probably not wrong

2497
02:04:29,056 --> 02:04:30,080
Bums me out but

2498
02:04:30,592 --> 02:04:31,872
A God there is that part of me that

2499
02:04:33,408 --> 02:04:35,456
Victor thinks strategically that

2500
02:04:37,760 --> 02:04:40,576
I say sleep on it and you'll realize in the morning

2501
02:04:41,088 --> 02:04:41,856
Do it's impossible

2502
02:04:42,112 --> 02:04:48,256
I know but this one Lionel gives us a very nice visual and that is Alex

2503
02:04:50,304 --> 02:04:50,816
In the future

2504
02:04:51,072 --> 02:04:52,864
But he doesn't unfortunately in the contacts

2505
02:04:53,376 --> 02:04:53,888
Really just

2506
02:04:54,144 --> 02:04:55,168
Kissing Alakazam

2507
02:04:55,424 --> 02:04:56,192
Real hard

2508
02:04:59,776 --> 02:05:00,544
But

2509
02:05:01,312 --> 02:05:07,456
Away we go I'm going to then as everybody is being distracted by the three card Monte of

2510
02:05:07,712 --> 02:05:09,248
Turn

2511
02:05:09,504 --> 02:05:11,296
Why we're looking this way

2512
02:05:11,552 --> 02:05:13,344
I'm going to little by little cake

2513
02:05:13,600 --> 02:05:16,160
Everything from this country

2514
02:05:16,672 --> 02:05:18,464
Before you know it is going to be

2515
02:05:18,720 --> 02:05:21,280
Maybe with a rumbling

2516
02:05:29,216 --> 02:05:30,240
Run the World

2517
02:05:34,080 --> 02:05:40,224
They thrive on disorder and disaster

2518
02:05:40,480 --> 02:05:43,040
Window screen

2519
02:05:43,296 --> 02:05:49,440
When we turn to the government in Azalea dielectrics

2520
02:05:49,696 --> 02:05:54,304
For more power more Authority

2521
02:05:54,816 --> 02:05:57,888
Then one day is over

2522
02:05:58,144 --> 02:05:59,424
Maybe

2523
02:05:59,680 --> 02:06:03,008
Your word your finals valedictory hours

2524
02:06:04,800 --> 02:06:06,080
I told you so

2525
02:06:06,592 --> 02:06:10,432
You thought I was just somebody who is conspiracy theorist

2526
02:06:10,688 --> 02:06:16,064
It's going to be too late you thought I was doing this trip or some kind of

2527
02:06:16,576 --> 02:06:20,928
You didn't realize that what I was saying and what the world was say

2528
02:06:21,440 --> 02:06:24,768
Was there the whole time and you didn't listen to me

2529
02:06:25,024 --> 02:06:30,144
I told you I tried to make it as simple as possible and I brought in guest

2530
02:06:30,400 --> 02:06:32,704
Explain in different way

2531
02:06:37,312 --> 02:06:39,872
So hard

2532
02:06:43,200 --> 02:06:44,992
God damn it I was so close

2533
02:06:45,248 --> 02:06:46,528
So close

2534
02:06:47,040 --> 02:06:47,808
I've been

2535
02:06:48,064 --> 02:06:50,880
Look I hate that mentality of like

2536
02:06:51,136 --> 02:06:52,928
1 year dad everyone will realize

2537
02:06:53,184 --> 02:06:55,744
You have the s*** has gone down and we should have listened to you

2538
02:06:56,000 --> 02:07:01,376
Premature profit status kind of really f****** dangerous

2539
02:07:01,888 --> 02:07:03,168
You're depending on

2540
02:07:03,936 --> 02:07:04,960
Like an outcome and

2541
02:07:05,216 --> 02:07:06,752
Status quo

2542
02:07:07,008 --> 02:07:08,288
Probably never will exist

2543
02:07:08,544 --> 02:07:10,848
In order to justify whatever you're saying in

2544
02:07:11,104 --> 02:07:11,616
Impreza

2545
02:07:12,896 --> 02:07:15,456
Classic logical fallacy

2546
02:07:15,712 --> 02:07:16,224
Just

2547
02:07:16,992 --> 02:07:19,808
Reinforcing Alex's need to spell iodine

2548
02:07:22,624 --> 02:07:28,512
And actually immediately after that clip Alex is like

2549
02:07:28,768 --> 02:07:29,536
Kiss your ass

2550
02:07:29,792 --> 02:07:31,072
Right

2551
02:07:31,328 --> 02:07:32,864
Of course

2552
02:07:33,120 --> 02:07:34,656
We took a time-traveling trip

2553
02:07:34,912 --> 02:07:35,680
Here

2554
02:07:35,936 --> 02:07:36,960
The 2015

2555
02:07:37,216 --> 02:07:37,728
Right

2556
02:07:37,984 --> 02:07:40,544
The things that were mostly talked about we're globalist

2557
02:07:41,568 --> 02:07:42,848
Destroyer

2558
02:07:43,872 --> 02:07:45,408
Lionel accidentally spills

2559
02:07:45,920 --> 02:07:46,944
My truck game plan

2560
02:07:49,248 --> 02:07:51,040
Is a little process

2561
02:07:53,600 --> 02:07:54,368
Was going to be

2562
02:07:55,648 --> 02:07:56,160
His belief

2563
02:07:57,952 --> 02:08:00,256
Three major things that were

2564
02:08:01,024 --> 02:08:04,096
Were American flag being bandwidth

2565
02:08:06,912 --> 02:08:08,192
No beers later has napping

2566
02:08:08,448 --> 02:08:11,008
And even there even there outside

2567
02:08:11,520 --> 02:08:12,544
Mark Dice

2568
02:08:14,592 --> 02:08:16,128
It's not going to happen

2569
02:08:16,640 --> 02:08:19,200
Greece's economy is doing better

2570
02:08:19,456 --> 02:08:25,344
It's that they're not all the way back

2571
02:08:25,600 --> 02:08:26,624
Lipstick

2572
02:08:26,880 --> 02:08:28,416
They're good sign

2573
02:08:28,672 --> 02:08:30,464
The end Tommy has been improving

2574
02:08:31,232 --> 02:08:31,744
Yes

2575
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:33,280
I mean it's not

2576
02:08:33,536 --> 02:08:37,888
Do you understand it like this whole argument that they're making of like

2577
02:08:38,144 --> 02:08:40,960
It's part of a pre-planned down slide

2578
02:08:41,216 --> 02:08:47,360
Blah blah blah

2579
02:08:47,616 --> 02:08:48,640
They talked about in this

2580
02:08:48,896 --> 02:08:50,432
Is bunk everything is bogus

2581
02:08:50,944 --> 02:08:53,248
Kernels of Truth are there in terms of like

2582
02:08:53,504 --> 02:08:54,016
Yeah these

2583
02:08:54,272 --> 02:08:54,784
Dunno

2584
02:08:55,040 --> 02:09:01,184
Banks are shity but all of the other stuff is

2585
02:09:01,440 --> 02:09:02,464
Absolutely not true

2586
02:09:02,976 --> 02:09:04,256
Planned collapse of Greece

2587
02:09:04,512 --> 02:09:06,816
Has not happened it's on the upswing

2588
02:09:07,072 --> 02:09:07,840
It's coming back

2589
02:09:08,096 --> 02:09:09,632
It'll take awhile to telling back

2590
02:09:12,192 --> 02:09:13,216
The IMF

2591
02:09:13,472 --> 02:09:13,984
Adequate info

2592
02:09:16,032 --> 02:09:16,800
Maybe we'll come back

2593
02:09:17,568 --> 02:09:18,592
Possibly

2594
02:09:19,616 --> 02:09:25,760
Beyond that there was that the family who had their kid taken away playing basketball

2595
02:09:26,016 --> 02:09:30,112
Also maybe they were being neglectful but maybe that also wasn't necessarily

2596
02:09:31,136 --> 02:09:33,440
Nosey neighbor

2597
02:09:33,696 --> 02:09:37,536
It wasn't it wasn't a globalist

2598
02:09:37,792 --> 02:09:40,352
Actuation where somebody you saw a dog

2599
02:09:40,864 --> 02:09:41,632
Hot car

2600
02:09:42,656 --> 02:09:43,424
Broke it out

2601
02:09:43,680 --> 02:09:45,472
Yeah because that was

2602
02:09:46,752 --> 02:09:47,264
For the dog.

2603
02:09:47,776 --> 02:09:51,104
Yeah there was a crack in the window

2604
02:09:52,384 --> 02:09:53,152
Maybe that's not a

2605
02:09:53,408 --> 02:09:53,920
Big enough

2606
02:09:54,432 --> 02:09:56,736
Yeah yeah

2607
02:09:58,272 --> 02:09:58,784
I was a great man

2608
02:10:00,320 --> 02:10:05,184
It was like a hundred bucks

2609
02:10:05,696 --> 02:10:09,024
So if your car has black widows into it

2610
02:10:10,048 --> 02:10:14,144
Bruce Willis

2611
02:10:14,400 --> 02:10:20,544
Kind of like it's unfortunate you didn't like it throughout the episode about gay marriage which is the main event

2612
02:10:20,800 --> 02:10:22,080
Legalized by the

2613
02:10:22,336 --> 02:10:26,432
Supreme Court Nationwide

2614
02:10:26,688 --> 02:10:27,200
Takeaway from this

2615
02:10:27,456 --> 02:10:27,968
Time travel up

2616
02:10:28,736 --> 02:10:29,248
Is

2617
02:10:29,504 --> 02:10:30,272
Before he

2618
02:10:30,784 --> 02:10:31,296
Himself to the

2619
02:10:31,808 --> 02:10:32,320
Praying

2620
02:10:33,088 --> 02:10:34,368
Didn't have to do as

2621
02:10:35,136 --> 02:10:35,648
Mental gymnast

2622
02:10:36,160 --> 02:10:36,672
You didn't have to

2623
02:10:36,928 --> 02:10:37,440
Makeup as much

2624
02:10:37,696 --> 02:10:39,744
It's true

2625
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:41,024
Like before that

2626
02:10:42,048 --> 02:10:43,840
Without supporting anybody

2627
02:10:44,096 --> 02:10:45,632
Cuz he's not coming out

2628
02:10:45,888 --> 02:10:46,400
Supporting a

2629
02:10:46,656 --> 02:10:48,448
A person saying dumbass

2630
02:10:48,960 --> 02:10:50,496
He's just anti-globalization

2631
02:10:50,752 --> 02:10:52,800
He's just in a nebulous place where you can

2632
02:10:53,312 --> 02:10:54,080
Pick and choose whatever

2633
02:10:54,336 --> 02:10:54,848
Fairfax he wants

2634
02:10:55,104 --> 02:10:55,872
Spiral out

2635
02:10:56,128 --> 02:11:02,272
Yeah a group that doesn't really exist so whatever you wanted no one can ever prove them wrong

2636
02:11:02,784 --> 02:11:04,320
But now is with his

2637
02:11:04,576 --> 02:11:05,088
6

2638
02:11:07,136 --> 02:11:08,928
He doesn't have a choice but to

2639
02:11:09,184 --> 02:11:10,464
You make things up haha

2640
02:11:10,720 --> 02:11:11,488
Because Trump

2641
02:11:11,744 --> 02:11:12,256
Frankly

2642
02:11:12,512 --> 02:11:13,536
Disagrees with him on

2643
02:11:14,304 --> 02:11:16,608
Well I would say this here's how I would describe it

2644
02:11:16,864 --> 02:11:19,680
Does Mike bare truth route

2645
02:11:19,936 --> 02:11:20,704
To our future

2646
02:11:20,960 --> 02:11:21,472
Time travel

2647
02:11:25,312 --> 02:11:26,080
Due date for you

2648
02:11:28,896 --> 02:11:31,456
But I will say is I think

2649
02:11:31,968 --> 02:11:33,248
Before

2650
02:11:34,016 --> 02:11:35,808
You hitched his wagon

2651
02:11:36,064 --> 02:11:38,112
To Trump

2652
02:11:38,368 --> 02:11:44,512
When he is like he is now

2653
02:11:44,768 --> 02:11:46,048
There are no more good day

2654
02:11:46,816 --> 02:11:49,120
He is all bad days now

2655
02:11:49,376 --> 02:11:49,888
Just

2656
02:11:50,656 --> 02:11:53,728
We're spoiled by current Alex

2657
02:11:53,984 --> 02:11:57,568
Is this is mostly low register Alex this isn't like

2658
02:11:57,824 --> 02:11:59,872
I'm still in stillwagon do

2659
02:12:00,128 --> 02:12:04,224
It's crazy but it's like Al Pacino you want him screaming

2660
02:12:06,784 --> 02:12:08,576
All right version

2661
02:12:08,832 --> 02:12:10,368
And that's kind of what a lot of this

2662
02:12:10,624 --> 02:12:12,672
This is

2663
02:12:13,952 --> 02:12:14,464
Heat output

2664
02:12:18,816 --> 02:12:20,608
Phuc yea

2665
02:12:21,120 --> 02:12:24,960
I really appreciate it

2666
02:12:25,216 --> 02:12:27,776
Thank you very much I'm going to do something crazy

2667
02:12:28,032 --> 02:12:30,592
I've never done this before

2668
02:12:30,848 --> 02:12:31,872
I am going to

2669
02:12:32,128 --> 02:12:32,896
To plug a show

2670
02:12:33,920 --> 02:12:34,432
Now

2671
02:12:34,688 --> 02:12:35,456
The facts

2672
02:12:38,528 --> 02:12:39,552
Now

2673
02:12:40,064 --> 02:12:42,368
This fact that I've never done this before

2674
02:12:42,624 --> 02:12:43,648
Maybe why I

2675
02:12:46,976 --> 02:12:49,536
Hopefully this will be so uncomfortable you'll never do it again

2676
02:12:49,792 --> 02:12:50,304
Brutal

2677
02:12:50,560 --> 02:12:56,704
The globalists are going to come find you at the show you know that you out

2678
02:12:58,496 --> 02:13:00,288
