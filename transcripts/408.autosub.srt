00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,832
Knowledge vype.com

4
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,280
Everybody likes it around Bicknell to Beverages and take a little bit about Alex

5
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:07,840
Text Jones Jordan

6
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:10,400
Damn you know I've been trying to get you

7
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,192
What's that

8
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:12,960
Witcher 3

9
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:19,360
Oh have you talked about it

10
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:20,128
Is the hardest

11
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:22,944
Decision you've had to make so far

12
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:25,504
Deciding to play it

13
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:31,904
I found a cheap used copy of it

14
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:36,000
Review

15
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:38,816
I don't want to give anything 10/10

16
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:41,888
Score or whatever

17
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:44,960
I don't know I just I haven't been playing it that much

18
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:45,984
That long

19
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,544
Met any

20
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,080
Super

21
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:54,944
I don't know is that there are so many complicated moral decisions

22
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,344
That you have to make love to you that is being listened to Too Much Ali

23
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,184
Alex Jones but I don't know if I encounter too many

24
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,792
Pigs as pets notably morally dubious

25
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:13,888
Have you done the Bloody Baron quest line yet

26
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:17,984
Probably a man there's some boys

27
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,824
Maybe I look at that more is just like oh this is

28
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,104
Bucked up

29
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:27,968
We live in a post morality world

30
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:30,016
I don't know I think it's alright

31
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:33,600
I heard a lot of people say like this game should be kept awake

32
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:34,880
Drink it because of all the f***

33
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,672
Yeah there's a lot of

34
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:38,976
Seen any of that up till this point

35
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:41,280
I don't have any don't look forward

36
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,048
To finding out what

37
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,608
I mean by that is a lot of complicated

38
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:51,008
Don't know much about Witcher but I do know about Alex

39
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:57,152
I also don't like how it's our introductions attorney get to video game reviews

40
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:05,344
March 11th

41
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,368
Through March

42
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,136
13

43
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:10,976
Wednesday through Friday of last week it was a trip

44
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:12,768
Texas life

45
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:15,328
He had just done his show

46
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,096
Post

47
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,120
Not sleeping

48
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,936
Spent the night at

49
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,032
The little dual screen

50
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:27,872
That was on the 12th that was Tuesday the 12th

51
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,176
Happened

52
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:35,040
Answer Wednesday through Friday is every tumultuous. For Alex

53
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:41,696
He's still trying to push a lot of the coronavirus situation to trying to deal with the major news that's going on

54
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:42,464
Pain in the world

55
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,256
But you can tell that something is

56
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,024
Not right

57
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:45,792
Like

58
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:46,816
This is

59
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:48,096
A very

60
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:49,120
F***** up stretch

61
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:51,424
I'm not going to

62
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,704
Sugarcoat it at all

63
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,984
Okay this is

64
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,776
Trouble

65
00:03:57,056 --> 00:04:00,896
You asked if I was okay when you came in by Forest recording

66
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,176
Any part of it was like

67
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:02,944
This is

68
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:09,088
Messed up stuff this ride is going to be as messed up as a couple of missions in The Witcher

69
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,624
No problem.

70
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,392
Okay

71
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:16,512
So I will get down to business on that before

72
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,280

This is what I buy taurine

77
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,407

78
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,175
Dafont

00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:40,831

00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:58,751

Technocrat

Heroin

89
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:21,023
Freakishly large

90
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:28,447
Kristen

91
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:37,151
So Jordan we start off today on March 11th

92
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,175
What you B note

93
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,455
Is 311

94
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,735
And we know one thing

95
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,527
Alex hates 3053

96
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:46,623
But

97
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,647
By this point

98
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:48,927
Other media

99
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,999
It started picking up on Alex's she'll Versailles

100
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:57,119
The way he was very inappropriately unethically possibly illegally

101
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,935
Is silver gargle in toothpaste

102
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:02,239
And So It Begins

103
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,007
New show

104
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,823
Dublin the f*** down

105
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,871
Jones

106
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:14,271
He claims protect you against Coronavirus

107
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,191
Play on this garbage

108
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:37,055
The truth is we showed you the documents

109
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:40,127
From the Pentagon and from A&M

110
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:46,527
Nanosilver of this type is known to kill viruses at the fact the hospital

111
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:49,087
Nanosilver products

112
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,367
So you were right

113
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:52,927
To sell your supplement as if it were a drug

114
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:53,695
Then

115
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:58,559
It should have been approved by the FDA

116
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:01,375
And this is going to be

117
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,167
System thread throughout

118
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:09,055
Somebody who has robbed is that corporate representative position is bad

119
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,335
Self-esteem goddamn

120
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,871
Yeah you it's unexpected

121
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:17,503
So I was get to talkin about the these documents from the Pentagon and all that and

122
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,575
I think that if you listen to this especially as it gets

123
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,879
It's further on and the attention gets

124
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:23,903
Larger

125
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,695
It's being put onto Alex about this

126
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,231
Sales issue

127
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:31,327
I think it becomes pretty clear that he knows damn well that those documents are only

128
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,863
We talkin about the wuzhou

129
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:48,991
Will you try to label this is a stronger silver you can get over the counter

130
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:57,183
The strongest American nanotech company puts it out please

131
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:11,519
Leftist are so anti-human

132
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:17,151
National holidays

133
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:23,551
They they literally don't want you to know about silver that goddamn these people are

134
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:29,439
I'm not positive that he does get back to that story about the holiday but

135
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,487
That's a classic methinks you do

136
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,279
The situation

137
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,607
That cadences

138
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,399
What they do what they don't like is what

139
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:40,191
Food delivery

140
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:42,495
Yeah

141
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:48,895
You're not talk about the issue

142
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:51,455
You don't think you can tell like about the

143
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,479
The gel it's like

144
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,551
That is the one that is approved for sales that way

145
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:57,855
So

146
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,647
Alex has been thinking that real deep

147
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:00,415
About this virus

148
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,695
And he wants you to know that

149
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:02,463
The main thing

150
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,511
Important to remember is that it's man-made

151
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,303
But also

152
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,095
He has people on the show

153
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,375
You really scare you

154
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:11,423
Because that's important to

155
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,727
4 a.m. this morning and I spent

156
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,311
Ed Sheeran

157
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,383
Bringing a cup of coffee

158
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:24,735
Answer the phone not reading news relief

159
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:27,295
Dwelling

160
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:29,343
Cogitating

161
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:30,623
Jitter

162
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,231
Information

163
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,767
Chili's

164
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,071
And I'm going to lay it out

165
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:40,607
Right now

166
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:45,471
Vision engineered man-made by 11

167
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:46,751
They don't discuss

168
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,543
Because after Achilles heel

169
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:53,407
It's been deployed it has a low kill rate

170
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,199
Supercenter Subway

171
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,735
The elderly that's Superman

172
00:09:57,247 --> 00:10:01,599
Maybe quarter percent 4:30 Central Public still a big deal still want to get them

173
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:08,255
Horsham scenarios

174
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,863
What's going on

175
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,703
The world map

176
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,263
Open

177
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,847
No it's not

178
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:24,639
No that's not I need to have

179
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:30,015
Outrageous alarmist

180
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,039
Important part of us

181
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:34,367
Finding the right narrative

182
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:38,975
That's like having a writer's room or something along those lines

183
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:43,071
Not trying to format I elected

184
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:46,399
We're going to brainstorm all the reasons you're going to die on ER

185
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:52,799
Present them as if they are all

186
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,847
And then later we'll pretend

187
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,639
Just spitballing

188
00:10:56,895 --> 00:11:02,015
That's very responsible kind of is aware of them

189
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,039
The really going to think he's

190
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,063
You know

191
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:06,111
Let me know she's not going to be many people to say I told

192
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:14,559
So a lot of the narrative is just over the maintenance kind of situation a lot of it's the same stuff that he's been

193
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:16,095
Observe building with

194
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:20,191
Obama sold it to China

195
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:22,495
The building blocks are really wet

196
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:23,775
Which is what keeps getting

197
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:24,543
Pushed

198
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,567
And

199
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,359
There's a few

200
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:28,895
Slight changes

201
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:30,431
Other special edition

202
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,199
Lot of spinach

203
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:35,807
Is Wheels though like Alex starts talking about this idea he has

204
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:36,831
There are a ton of different

205
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:37,599
Prince trains

206
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,695
About 3 weeks ago

207
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:45,023
I thought that the other strains of something bigger

208
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:48,863
And now I'm sure of it and now we see them saying that

209
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,655
Priming the pump

210
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:53,215
The only tell you what they're going to do before they do it

211
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,287
If you're not getting chills you're crazy

212
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:59,103
The media

213
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,127
You want to go out

214
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:10,623
Well I just got the biggest she'll ever had in life when I'm on target man always very sad

215
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,671
Target

216
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:17,023
Beyond the Veil spirit world.

217
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,815
That's it

218
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:24,191
To doing know what it is

219
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,471
Digitakt

220
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:33,663
What do you need to get not hysterical you need to get right with God you can tell everybody that it's a stage the man

221
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,551
The other so people understand

222
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:40,575
That

223
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:44,415
This is an attack on our markets attack on our confidence

224
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,583
Come back coronavirus and some other things

225
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:55,679
But I do just want to remind all of you that

226
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,727
Anything I promoted

227
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:00,031
Really believe is the best thing and needs to be done

228
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:04,383
Are there

229
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:09,247
Stream situation a little bit later

230
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:11,039
Is it more but for now just

231
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:15,903
Try and scare people getting lead him naturally

232
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,183
Into any local

233
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:20,255
So he's he's really defensive

234
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:26,655
About the silver sales tactics surrounding

235
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,423
Those tax

236
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:28,703
And so he

237
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,983
Deploys lot of straw man

238
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:34,335
You already heard earlier and saying they're saying I sell fake weed never

239
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:37,663
And now he brings out what is probably his largest

240
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:40,991
Strawman to play this pretty regularly

241
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:41,759
It's very

242
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:45,855
Let me just show TV viewers since Mother Jones just demonizing eyes

243
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:49,439
In a very deceptive formulaic piece where they show other people

244
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:53,791
Mets flames and violated

245
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,071
FDA regulations

246
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:58,911
Regulate supplements but then they'll come after you if

247
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:05,567
You say you need water delivery sunshines good for you or you got a vitamin C live

248
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:15,807
So Alex is only real defense he can have in terms of his be clearly unethical sales

249
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:16,831
Silver products

250
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:18,367
Is to create straw man argument

251
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,903
The FDA is not making

252
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:22,463
Here you see one of these regular formulation

253
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:26,559
Saying that the FDA won't let you save the humans need oxygen or water

254
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:29,119
So the basic point that he wants his audience

255
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,679
The thing is that the FDA doesn't allow you to say things that are

256
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,703
Completely established

257
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:33,983
Damn, knowledge

258
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:37,311
Because he's trying to make his claims appear to be established

259
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,335
Uncommon knowledge

260
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,127
He wants his audience to take

261
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,407
His claims about the silver product

262
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:44,479
Bienville legitimate as someone saying you need air to live

263
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:47,039
The problem is the what he saying about the f

264
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:47,807
58

265
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:48,575
True

266
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:52,671
The nutrition labeling and Education Act of 1990 establishes that there are certain

267
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,719
Types of claims that are solidly proven

268
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,743
Widely accepted

269
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:56,767
To the point where you can make the

270
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,583
About supplements in the FDA does not care

271
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:05,727
The FDA has a big list of these on their website including things like the relationship between calcium and osteoporosis

272
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,007
Or sodium in hyper

273
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:07,775
Pretension

274
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:10,847
If you sell a calcium supplement and you promoted by saying that

275
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,639
I can help you avoid osteoporosis

276
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:14,687
The FDA considers you to be in the clear

277
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,967
And they're not going to do anything

278
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:16,735
Think about it

279
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:21,855
Claims like you need water or you should breathe obviously things have to be ft8 does not care

280
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,159
This is a stupid thing

281
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:26,719
But I don't we know the 5G Cleaves to Ox

282
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:27,999
You never know what could

283
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,023
Sure

284
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,815
But Alex beads is audience to think

285
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:36,959
These ifta people are so aggressive and nitpicky that even the most obvious claims are too loud because he needs them to think

286
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:41,055
Egregious example of someone making it unfounded helpline

287
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,591
He also need them.

288
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:45,151
But he was defrosting them

289
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,431
Never gazette's

290
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,455
That's dangerous

291
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,271
Because he's getting a lot of heat

292
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,295
On this front

293
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,319
Decides to

294
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,599
Promote another product

295
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,135
And maybe

296
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,695
Maybe he doesn't do a good job

297
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:02,047
I want to show losartan viewers a couple things were going to break here

298
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:12,543
40

299
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,079
Percent

300
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,967
What does nitrous oxide

301
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:25,087
Look it up

302
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:28,671
What does boosting the entire

303
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,207
System

304
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,743
Agency

305
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:36,607
So Alex is getting really defensive about the other media picking up on his silver gargola

306
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:39,167
Toothpaste how are you selling them as Protections in

307
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:42,239
What kind of vaguely as cures for the Coronavirus

308
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:44,543
In an attempt to sound really research

309
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:48,127
In studies study besides to pull out a bunch of science to demonstrate

310
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,919
All this product is super good for you

311
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,223
And apparently he has too much of sob

312
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,783
In the warehouse because he decides to start pushing

313
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,855
Beats are really high in nitric oxide

314
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:59,135
Not nitrous oxide

315
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:02,207
And this product he's selling his very beat-heavy

316
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:03,487
Are you saying it's not going to get you high

317
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:04,511
No

318
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:08,863
So Alex is pulling out these studies about nitric oxide being helpful for immune response

319
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,679
However he clearly hasn't read any of these studies

320
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:17,055
They're just printed out pieces of paper that have had lines that are to show people that you know

321
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,127
Nitric oxide to human immune response

322
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:21,663
However

323
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:25,247
None of these Studies have anything to do with people taking nitric oxide

324
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,295
Having a better immune response

325
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:32,159
They're all just about how the actual compound nitric oxide plays a role in immunity

326
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:36,511
Usually studies to establish that you can sell a beat product to boost immunity

327
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:40,863
Probably not hold up in court because they're not relevant studies to the claims being made

328
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,143
Also I have

329
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:42,911
Distress Alex

330
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,447
Absolutely not read these studies

331
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:46,751
One of them is from the July 28th

332
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:49,311
18 journal of clinical and diagnostic research

333
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,335
With the headline

334
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:52,383
Nitric oxide its role in immune

335
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,431
Newspaper include the section

336
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,711
Entitled

337
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:58,271
Nitric oxide and immune regulation

338
00:17:58,527 --> 00:17:59,295
Which begins quote

339
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:03,647
Exact function of nitric oxide in the immune regulation is on

340
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:08,511
Clear there is a roll but even this review is saying that it's not fully understood

341
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:13,375
Considering that the sales pitch is happening in the middle of a viral outbreak in Alex's clearly marked

342
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,911
Marketing is products in that context

343
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,447
He probably be good to check

344
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:19,007
Check the section about nitric oxide immunity and viruses

345
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:23,871
Which does say that nitric oxide helps with virus immunity but also that quote

346
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,407
During clearance of virus

347
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:29,503
High levels of nitric oxide can produce some undesirable effects on the house

348
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:30,783
Like hemorrhagic

349
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:31,551
Fever

350
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:32,831
It seems like

351
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:38,463
The point is that low levels of nitric oxide that's likely to be good in the body's natural immune response

352
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:40,767
But they do have really high levels of it

353
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,047
You can have some pretty naked

354
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:42,815
Consequences

355
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:46,655
You would know that if you just read the papers introduction

356
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:53,311
Nitric oxide is also implicated in the path of physiology of various cancers breast larynx

357
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,335
Cervix head in that

358
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:58,431
Doomer promoting role of nitric oxide is dependent on the tumor type

359
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,455
Nitric oxide

360
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:01,247
I concentration interact

361
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,015
Chicken with protein

362
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,807
Metals or free radicals

363
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:05,343
And the genetic makeup of the house

364
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:09,183
Lower concentration of nitric oxide is important for immune function

365
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:13,535
Well nitric oxide at higher levels are shown to be immunosuppressive

366
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:16,351
Suggesting a dual role the biomolecule

367
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:19,423
If you have too much nitric oxide in your system

368
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,751
According to the study that Alex was using as a citation on air

369
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:25,567
It can lead to tumor growth and immunosuppression

370
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,359
That seems Reckless of him

371
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:30,943
But it becomes even more Reckless when you hear this

372
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:34,015
Now they super concentrated bean extract

373
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:39,391
One of the strongest you're going to find out there

374
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:41,183
Vascular system is good

375
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,975
Michelle's is back in stock

376
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:46,303
Papa John's I'm getting my children

377
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,583
Give them a lot of it

378
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:51,935
Probably not a good idea to give your kids as much Nitric

379
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,263
Dockside supplement as you want while citing a study that literally says

380
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:57,823
Too much nitric oxide is really bad for you

381
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:01,663
An ungenerous reading of that behavior would be that Alex wants his audience

382
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:02,431
Have to

383
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,967
Immunosuppressed

384
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:04,735
That's the only

385
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:08,319
Conclusion you can come to you actually believe that Alex's read the study

386
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,087
Deciding

387
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:10,879
I'm far from a scientist

388
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:12,927
But from the studies Alex has provided

389
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:16,767
It seems clear that having too much nitric oxide in your system could be very bad for you

390
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:20,607
And here he is on there saying you can take as much of it as you want and that your kids

391
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:21,375
Can take a bunch

392
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,423
That's incredibly irresponsible Behavior

393
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,471
You're in from where I'm sitting that indicates that weird

394
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:28,031
Situation were Alex's refusal to do any work

395
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:28,799
Coupons

396
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:30,079
Doodle rescue his audience

397
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:30,847
Does help

398
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:31,871
Hey please understand

399
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:33,919
Alex has no f****** idea what he's talking to

400
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,455
Later in the show

401
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,479
He's promoting this beat

402
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,503
Product by saying

403
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:39,807
High in nitrous oxide again

404
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:44,927
Outside chemical compounds

405
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:50,303
Write down the blood increase nitrous oxide

406
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:54,399
Incredible

407
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,679
SOB's

408
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:57,471
Concentrated

409
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,775
Strongest concentrates

410
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:02,079
Beet extract

411
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:11,295
Outside its role in immunity

412
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:15,391
Let's get f***** up

413
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:18,976
Nitrous oxide is n2o and it's f****** laughing

414
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,792
Nitric oxide is an o

415
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:25,120
Are very different things and Alex doesn't even know was product well enough to

416
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:25,888
To know what's in the

417
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,192
This is not a good showing

418
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:34,080
For him trying to be defensive about how he sells a product I think this was a swing-and-miss

419
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:36,896
Just you just can't understand how you could

420
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:38,432
Could take the worst thing you could

421
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:41,760
Could do and really do worse with another Pro

422
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:46,368
It's impressive on a certain level

423
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:47,392
He's just lying

424
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,672
With the recipes

425
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,744
Borderline actively trying to kill people

426
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:56,096
I don't know about that I don't I don't know what level of

427
00:21:56,352 --> 00:22:02,240
Nitric oxide those Vezzo Beats pills have

428
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:04,288
Be dangerous even if you take a bunch

429
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:05,568
But the mentality

430
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:08,384
Is irresponsible 34

431
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:12,736
So he keeps you know every now and again he'll bring up those

432
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:13,504
Those

433
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,856
We've already talked about that Rebecca silver

434
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:18,880
Toothpaste

435
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:21,440
To reconsider throughout this

436
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,000
Alex gets down to

437
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:25,792
Little bit of talking about

438
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:26,816
His DUI

439
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:27,840
My situation

440
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:28,864
Twi

441
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,936
You got arrested on Monday evening into Tuesday morning

442
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:33,728
And

443
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:35,520
He seems to think

444
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:36,544
That

445
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,336
The media

446
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,104
Is

447
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,176
Controlled by the CIA and they're attacking him

448
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:44,736
By people covering his DUI

449
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:47,040
Giant development

450
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:49,856
Ultraman coronavirus run

451
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:51,648
Not here at the moment but first

452
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:53,952
Look at the CNN headlines

453
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:57,280
Infowars Alex Jones accused

454
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:59,072
Twi

455
00:22:59,328 --> 00:22:59,840
Haha

456
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:00,608
Got them

457
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:07,776
Thousands of the newspapers every TV channel that you randomly checked because it was typing then

458
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:11,360
CIA Mockingbird program

459
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:14,688
CIA operative

460
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:16,736
Mockingbird

461
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:18,784
And Obama is still in control of it

462
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:24,160
Everyone else is saying

463
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:26,208
Headlines

464
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:33,888
Accused of BWI

465
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:40,544
This is just a case of CNN initially run with the headline Alex Jones accused of DWI then later updating it

466
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,848
Alex Jones arrested on DWI charge

467
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,384
Those are accurate state

468
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,176
Both are fine to run as headlines

469
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:50,784
But the latter is probably more indicative of what the story is so I can understand why an editor might change

470
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,552
Change that later

471
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,880
It's fair to assume that I say that Alex was a

472
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:57,184
Accused of DWI by the state of Texas

473
00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:00,768
It's the same thing you know where you presume someone's innocent

474
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,816
Until they've been to court

475
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:05,120
Alex allegedly was driving drunk

476
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:06,656
You can say that

477
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:10,496
It's also fair to say that he was arrested for DWI because he definitely was

478
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:14,848
Mark Richards was accused of both killing that guy as well as

479
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:21,248
Flying a plane and being off-planet has anyone accused him of the ladder now he is only guilty of

480
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:22,016
Whataburger

481
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,344
Claim the ladder

482
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,880
You can't say his wife has a

483
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:29,696
Accused him of being offline

484
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:30,720
He said okay that's

485
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:39,424
Just an instance of an editorial update that Alex is going to try and eat some kind of Nefarious plot to demonize him in the media

486
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:42,240
You don't talk about anything other than the reality

487
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:44,032
And his audiences Prime to believe him

488
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:45,568
People Janik says business

489
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:50,688
CIA Mockingbird stuff so nothing that you see about Alex in the media is real at all

490
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:51,456
Ignore it

491
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,504
There's a bit of a segment

492
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,832
Where Alex retells the story of being

493
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:58,112
We arrested for drunk driving

494
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,648
It is kind of sad

495
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:00,928
What you see is a complete

496
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:04,768
Refusal in any way except dangerous

497
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:05,536
And wrong

498
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:07,328
And he just is is

499
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:08,096
Blaming

500
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:09,120
Everybody

501
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:10,656
But himself

502
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:11,424
Import

503
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,288
Everybody who's writing these stories about his DWI

504
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:20,384
Propaganda fide propaganda

505
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:21,664
Of the media

506
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:22,688
Yeah

507
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:23,456
Yeah that

508
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:26,272
Every major Channel

509
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:28,832
Every major newspaper

510
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:30,624
Jones

511
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,160
Twi

512
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:38,048
70w

513
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:41,120
Because that's what that is

514
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,240
0.6

515
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:47,008
Oh you heard that

516
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:52,384
So it's not unify propaganda for media Outlets report that Alex got arrested for DWI

517
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:54,176
It would be bad recording

518
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:57,504
Play said that he'd been found guilty of it in court they said that he'd been

519
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,320
Convicted but to say that he got arrested or that he was charged

520
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:02,112
Those are accurate statement

521
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:05,696
Eastbound wonderly CNN Headline that has been up

522
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:08,000
Hate it that says he was accused of buwi

523
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:13,120
So what he's doing is claiming the only accurate headline where's the restaurant propaganda

524
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:14,144
Set

525
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,424
Alex drove drunk

526
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,216
Instead of taking responsibility for his actions

527
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:19,776
He needs the world to know that Not only was he the victim

528
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:20,544
In the arrest

529
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,080
He's also the victim in

530
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:23,104
Interglobal send

531
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,664
Because the media is accurately reporting

532
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:33,600
Also pretty much every state has a DWI limit of .08

533
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:34,880
With the exception of Utah

534
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:38,208
Utah as a limited .05 but it's also important

535
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:40,000
Keep in mind that Utah is the state

536
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:42,560
The country with the most restrictive alcohol laws

537
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:46,912
I only only state-regulated liquor stores can sell beer with higher than

538
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:48,192
5% alcohol

539
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:49,984
There's a bunch of cities in the state where you can

540
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,520
Can't even buy booze at all

541
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:54,336
Using Utah as an example of why you shouldn't

542
00:26:54,592 --> 00:27:00,736
Have been arrested for drunk driving is not a good argument come on

543
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:01,760
Who cares

544
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:02,528
Some

545
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:06,624
I don't think that I'm going

546
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,160
To let it pass

547
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:10,464
So Alex decides

548
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,488
2 oz

549
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,512
At this point

550
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:13,280
He's taking the knee

551
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:18,912
He's getting out of Studio Beats from Wednesday to Friday and

552
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:20,960
The he'll be you'll be out all over the neck

553
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:25,568
Go and get behind the wheel of a car and have a high alcohol level

554
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:26,336
Yes

555
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:33,504
Before but certainly not

556
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,528
Not an argument

557
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,808
That's the case

558
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:38,368
I was already taking next week off I'll call the show something but

559
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:46,304
And I just happen to be so free of it

560
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,096
But I'm never going to drink again

561
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:50,656
I'm really conflicted about this because

562
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:52,704
It's that intersection of the personal life

563
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,984
An on-air Life of Alex

564
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,776
That I find really did

565
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:56,544
Difficult to navigate

566
00:27:57,312 --> 00:28:00,640
I don't play this clip to mock Alex for his claims that he'll never drink

567
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:05,504
And again I'm playing this to demonstrate what Alex thinks is worthwhile spending time with

568
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,272
On his show

569
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:09,856
There's no standards or professionalism on the show at all

570
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:12,160
He's supposed to be getting into the big news about the

571
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:15,744
Coronavirus but it's about 40 minutes into the episode of this point

572
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,536
And so far it's mostly been

573
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:21,888
And being defensive about his sales practices and a big defensive about a Twi

574
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,936
I understand that in order for him to

575
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:25,728
To continue to operate as a business

576
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:26,752
He has to protect

577
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:29,056
After the scam from the natural consequences

578
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:30,336
Of the way he runs the sky

579
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:33,664
But it really feels like he's coming to the point where he's in over his

580
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:35,200
It's it

581
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:36,992
Feels it feels like especially

582
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:38,272
The way he

583
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:43,136
Do you need to respond to these things on air so much

584
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:43,904
Time with me

585
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:49,536
Opposition to other times things have happened he's really been much more deflection

586
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:50,560
Oriented

587
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:55,680
Stand to these accusations it away it's like

588
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:56,704
Buddy

589
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,472
You are going

590
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:58,752
Turn into Lenny Bruce

591
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:01,824
Like to do all your stand up shows about how you got to rest

592
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,104
Yeah yeah

593
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:03,872
Not its

594
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:04,896
Not as good

595
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:05,664
Strategy

596
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,968
You still got to give people a good show if you want to drive

597
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:13,088
Yeah only be like most devoted

598
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:14,112
Folk

599
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:16,160
Are going to put up with that kind of rayon

600
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:17,440
Entertaining Lotus

601
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:19,488
Is 4 hours long

602
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:20,512
But Alex only host

603
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:21,792
The first 3 hours

604
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:25,888
When that was the third of the way through his on-air time on this

605
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:27,168
Button episode

606
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:31,008
Restatement of his dumb virus stuff

607
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:32,032
You provided no,

608
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:33,312
Other than his own person

609
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:34,080
Issues

610
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:35,104
Bleeding into his

611
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:35,872
Professional life

612
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:38,432
He can't perform isn't effective propagandist

613
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:40,224
Because his narcissistic need

614
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,760
To protect his own self-image

615
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:42,784
Just getting in the way

616
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,064
Exactly like the band

617
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:45,344
Exactly

618
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,112
Look at you

619
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:47,136
Exactly

620
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:49,440
The band 311

621
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:53,792
United's I have no idea about anything about him it's just the only name I can picnic

622
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:55,584
I know two people in 311

623
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:58,912
This week off but if he thinks

624
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:00,960
That that stuff with his silver sales

625
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,752
Just going to blow over in that time

626
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:03,776
He might be in for

627
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:04,544
A bit of a surprise

628
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:06,592
I don't say I don't know if that's

629
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:10,176
So Alex decides going to buckle down now

630
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:20,672
About to hit the latest on the coronavirus coronavirus and the response to it in a coordinated level

631
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:27,072
President-trump

632
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:33,728
I believe they probably already released until you should get ready

633
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:40,640
A whole line of products that are known and documented wow

634
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:44,736
Customer research and studies

635
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:51,136
Really good for your body boost your immune system and we have the DNA Force plus now back in stock

636
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:54,720
Looks like The infomercials not quite done yet the fake out

637
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:59,584
The old eyebrow fake we got to get to the coronavirus we're going to get to all that but

638
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:02,656
I just got to tell you about these amazing products that are back

639
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:04,192
Supergirl

640
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:05,216
It's amazing

641
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:09,312
So Alex Hawksmoor hear about that the

642
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:10,848
I think that this just

643
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:12,896
It's going to be

644
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:15,456
Almost exactly the same thing as a clip I already played

645
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:19,808
But I think it's important to stress that I believe there is an awareness that Alex knows

646
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:20,832
That the claims

647
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:21,856
In those

648
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:23,904
Bedford he has are just about the womb

649
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:27,232
We also have the super silver toothpaste

650
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:28,256
With a nano

651
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:31,840
And I'm not going to sit here and go into a long discussion about

652
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:38,496
The patented nanosilver but it is being approved over-the-counter in the super silver for topical

653
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:42,080
The strongest silver you're going to find over-the-counter

654
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:44,640
So I believe there is an awareness

655
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:47,712
Of what the actual things that he's been blurry

656
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:50,784
He specifically said this is been approved in the wound

657
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:52,576
Specifically

658
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:53,856
It's been approved yet

659
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:54,624
Angele

660
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:00,768
And I think this takes away a little bit of the plausible deniability about like him being can

661
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:02,560
Confused are not knowing what these

662
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:03,328
These things are

663
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:05,376
I don't I don't know

664
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,912
Yeah I mean

665
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:08,192
I'm sure you could office gator

666
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:08,960
Enough

667
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:10,240
Pastor the

668
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,520
Shittiness of the illegal

669
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:12,800
Possibly

670
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:13,568
This is definitely

671
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:14,336
He knows what

672
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:18,432
Yeah I've been wearing out-of-court what I can see from the indications of his

673
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:24,064
His words

674
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:24,832
Past 3 years

675
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:26,112
I don't think Alex

676
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:26,880
Getting away with it

677
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:28,416
Question

678
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:32,256
Tell Barnes to go home

679
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:33,280
Good work

680
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:39,424
Talking here about the surprise sale and I think Alex is back to

681
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,192
Canadian money

682
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:46,592

All the free right now and it's a free shipping for wide is implemented again right now stay with us

686
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:08,352
I suspect that Alex is facing

687
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:09,632
Sing some new legal

688
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:12,448
I plan for some fines in my near future

689
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:16,032
Stores ready for that

690
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:17,312
I have

691
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:19,360
A reasonable suspicion

692
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:20,128
But that might be the

693
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:21,152
Kcpa

694
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:24,224
GPS man

695
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:24,992
So

696
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:27,808
During the second hour of the show Alex Lee

697
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:30,624
Okay good

698
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,416
Do you just leave

699
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:34,976
Take care of The Assault reviews on there

700
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:42,144
Yes Owen Shroyer fill in with this guest named Gary Haven who Alex says is a pilot and a billionaire

701
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,448
Supposedly just met with Governor Abbott

702
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:45,472
I have no idea

703
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:49,568
Gary Haven is buddies on it forward so I do not trust him at face value

704
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,152
Maybe he met with Governor Abbott maybe you didn't I have no idea

705
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:55,456
Anyway Alex leave because he's dealing with things

706
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:57,248
He doesn't want the audience to know that

707
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:59,552
In the aftermath of his arrest Alex

708
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:00,832
Ex-wife filed a motion

709
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:02,624
To be granted custody of their children

710
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,160
Which ultimately led to a judge

711
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:04,928
Requiring Alec

712
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:06,208
Text to get drug and alcohol test

713
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:09,792
That news broke on Wednesday so I'm pretty certain that this is

714
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,840
Is what I was trying to dress off air

715
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:13,632
Wow he was

716
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:15,936
Decided to leave his show to get healthiest all

717
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:21,824
Again his personal troubles are bleeding heavily into his professional life in such a way that he's unable to do his job

718
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:25,408
And host then Mike Adams takes over for the rest of the show

719
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:30,528
Alex did nothing on this episode literally nothing outside of pretending he's a victim and his DWI

720
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,320
Anton's of expanded infobear

721
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:33,344
The show is

722
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:35,904
I I think I'm going to steal that and

723
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:36,672
And use that as

724
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:43,840
I've take care of yourself

725
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:46,144
Globalist

726
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:47,680
Globulin

727
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:51,008
Call Oliva party

728
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:53,824
Going to be there in the morning

729
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:57,920
I'm under heavy assault by the globalists talk to you guys later

730
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:01,248
My bad I mean you're out of boobs

731
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:03,040
I'm so weak

732
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:03,808
Get to the 12th

733
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:04,576
Already

734
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:05,600
And Alex

735
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,672
This is one of my favorite

736
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:12,768
F****** announcements to start a show that I've ever heard this is so good

737
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:14,560
I was locked

738
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:16,608
And loaded complaining

739
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,424
Focus with just

740
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:21,472
Come on air

741
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:28,896
Research and in the president

742
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:34,016
Start getting ready to speak again and I said well let me just start the show with that then of course the computer

743
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:38,112
Frieza shop in Manchester way works Nigeria

744
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:48,608
I want to lay it out I'm going to rebroadcast for a while to cool down

745
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,912
Anybody's fault

746
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:55,008
Laser focused again and come back

747
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:57,056
Gouache

748
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:58,592
Before I lay all this out

749
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:03,456
Just calm down

750
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:07,040
So what happened is Alex David hours and hours of research

751
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:13,184
Figured everything out he's got the globalist master plan that he's going to lay out for you then started watching

752
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,720
Trump give a speech

753
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:20,864
There's a glitch any lost everything. Please reset

754
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:24,448
Please I got to go to rebroadcast I don't

755
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:30,848
Know what is funnier

756
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:34,688
There's two possibilities really and that is that Alex's dresser to bluffing

757
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:39,040
And trying to be like I understand everything but I'm not ready to to lay it out

758
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:42,368
Because I don't really understand everything that's kind of funny that bluff

759
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:44,416
But it's also funny or to imagine

760
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:45,184
That he did

761
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:48,000
Prepare and got everything in order and then

762
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:50,560
Just got so mad because of a takeaway baby like

763
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:51,328
I don't

764
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,352
Remember what the globalist

765
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:54,656
Liquid Richard

766
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:55,424
F****** high school

767
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,448
You got your term paper

768
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:58,752
Oh s*** I forgot to save it

769
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:04,384
Yeah but Alex's that guy but he has no teacher it's just the audience kind of

770
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:07,712
And now let him do anything

771
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:14,624
You can just say that through the global state has homework every single time and damn globalist

772
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,184
I didn't do my book report don't care don't exist

773
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,256
So Alex does

774
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:21,536
Get back on track

775
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:23,328
And he has

776
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:24,096
Usher

777
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:25,632
Shocking

778
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:26,656
Okay

779
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:28,960
Very good chance that

780
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:33,056
Tom Hanks of the total Global to take the president

781
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,576
Alex is a Tom Hanks prison

782
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:49,952
Yep yep. Max is Tom Hanks and his wife making

783
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:51,232
Something positive

784
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:55,840
Coronavirus in order to take attention away from Trump speech

785
00:37:56,096 --> 00:38:01,728
The globalist made bachelor party with this in mind and this was the plan from the very beginning

786
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:02,752
Absolutely

787
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:05,312
Kisho and now we're here

788
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:08,896
This is an interesting intersection of like qanon and Alex

789
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:10,688
They both hate

790
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:18,112
Very weird Cloud Atlas with Tom Hanks

791
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:19,648
I think everything makes a lot more so

792
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:20,672
Sure

793
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:27,328
So Alex I initially thought that that was kind of a throwaway thing and he's

794
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:30,144
Just mad that Tom Hanks and Izakaya Faking It

795
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:32,192
You going to bring it up again later

796
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:33,472
But Alex gets

797
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:34,496
How to

798
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,056
This is going to this is going to kill

799
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:39,104
Almost everybody everybody

800
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:39,872
You've either

801
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,432
Simultaneously as

802
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:45,248
Personal issues bleed into

803
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:47,808
His coverage in his inability to

804
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:48,576
Perform

805
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:49,344
Is job

806
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:51,136
And he started

807
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:52,416
On a pretty bad place

808
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:53,184
In terms of

809
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,464
Panicking

810
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,000
An escalating things

811
00:38:56,256 --> 00:39:01,120
But it was Mike Adams who said that it's over for Humanity there long to be Lone Survivor

812
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:05,472
Alex is now himself getting into bit more fatalistic

813
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:06,752
Overview

814
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:10,848
Laser focused and just go to the main point of the night we come back

815
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:14,944
And that's where it came from who's behind it what the plan is

816
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:18,016
I'm going to give you the bad news when I come back

817
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:20,064
I figured it out

818
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:25,952
We can walk through all the background in the viruses

819
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:29,792
She's going to make AIDS and HIV down the road

820
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:30,816
Look like

821
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:32,864
Very mild problem

822
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:35,424
They have just introduced to you

823
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,472
Population program

824
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:43,104
We don't stop them

825
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:45,152
Most of you will die for this

826
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:50,528
Sears news today

827
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:52,576
Next decades news today

828
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:58,720
Living defense that takes care of

829
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:06,912
5 months each back in stock

830
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:11,776
What this behavior is really coming back in full force this

831
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:18,176
Most of you are going to die of this also

832
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:24,832
Listen your you've got maybe five six years left don't worry about it we got some good s*** back in stock

833
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:26,368
Bye bye bye

834
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:30,976
It's not like this it's not necessarily went away or anything but it is

835
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:32,256
Really ubiq

836
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:38,912
This. I know you think that just because my personal life is clearly falling down around me that maybe I'm exaggerating

837
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:42,240
What is happening in the world right now

838
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:43,264
He's going to die in the world

839
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,544
Probably just because I predict

840
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,592
A little bit that maybe the bed I'm going to die myself

841
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:48,896
I'm going to die I'm going to die we're all going to die

842
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:56,064
Anyways we got the other DNA Force back in addressing

843
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,600
How you feel by the end of it

844
00:40:58,112 --> 00:41:00,672
So earlier Alex was saying that he sat down

845
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:07,328
Fertilized everything he got the globalist master plan in his mind that then he got mad and forgot it all

846
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:08,096
You're running we've got

847
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:09,120
The globalist masterful

848
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:11,424
In mind right ready to share it

849
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,704
You may think

850
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:17,568
How does Alex know these things do the globalist they're going to do and all those like how does he predict

851
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:19,104
Things ahead of time

852
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,384
Well thankfully

853
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,176
Alex decided to take a little hit his

854
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:23,456
Jake's Plano

855
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:27,296
People ask how I was able to do that

856
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:38,304
I did not get that information

857
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,168
Person

858
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,496
I was younger by Brian was

859
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:47,520
Better

860
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:53,919
Thousands of integrated point

861
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:56,479
I should be clear he's talking about predicting 911

862
00:41:56,735 --> 00:42:01,855
That's what he's talking about I thought you made it

863
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:04,159
Explicit

864
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:06,719
Pre-programming

865
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:08,511
For the fact

866
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:12,607
And

867
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:14,911
That much data

868
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:19,007
Call the police

869
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:20,287
How does he know how to

870
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:22,591
Only kills every few months

871
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:32,575
Finally be there in the right Zone and catch him trying to kidnap a woman

872
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:38,719
There's a lots of cases

873
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:53,311
Con artist 1-800 numbers in 90

874
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:02,271
And it's the same thing you got all this real data

875
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:05,343
And then your conscious brain is 100 times begging

876
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:07,391
Or less

877
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:08,159
Powerful

878
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:12,511
Right

879
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:17,887
Is an arrowhead

880
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:21,727
Unable to understand why

881
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:28,127
So right off the bat Alex predicted 911 because he listen to Bill Cooper's hour of the time and just do the prediction wholesale format

882
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:30,943
That's all he did there it has nothing to do with this subconscious

883
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:33,247
His mind remember the constellation of datapoint

884
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:34,015
Whatever

885
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:35,295
You guys ripped off another dude

886
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:37,343
Hasbro Bill predicted it I mean

887
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:42,719
Bin Laden had attacked the World Trade Center previously and wasn't making a secret that he wanted to do it again so

888
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:45,279
Whatever kind of had a vendetta

889
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:49,119
While it is true that some police departments consult psychics on a very limited

890
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:50,655
Bases in some cases

891
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:55,775
And some mixed results what else is describing is not the real world version of this sort of thing he's describing

892
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:56,799
TV shows and movies

893
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:02,687
Yeah if you listen to that and you don't clearly hear a man that

894
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:03,455
Knows he's

895
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:04,223
Full of s***

896
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:07,039
You are probably a man that knows your full

897
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:08,575
So Alex

898
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:14,207
Describing that as like all these data points and whatever he can put it all together

899
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:15,743
Describe the sort of like

900
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:17,279
Almost enters a state

901
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:18,559
Where you can make predictions

902
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:20,607
And see things he goes into mint at mode

903
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:21,375
Right

904
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:22,655
Describe another dude

905
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:24,703
Oh I apologize

906
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:26,239
Describe that

907
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:27,519
And then he's like

908
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:28,287
But

909
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:29,823
With the Coronavirus

910
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:35,455
Tire setup is like

911
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:37,503
I have psychic powers

912
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:39,551
And I can see things

913
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:42,879
Has nothing to do with what I'm talking about right now

914
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:43,647
Not helpful

915
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:45,183
I don't work on the CIA

916
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:51,839

00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:18,719
No

926
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:20,255
Really

927
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:25,375
Getting this place

928
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:30,751
That's that Easter level that I don't know how I do it okay

929
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:33,823
With the virus

930
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:35,615
It's not that

931
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:44,831
He is

932
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:49,183
Solutely documented and proven

933
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:51,999
Enrages me

934
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:53,023
That

935
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:56,095
It's so obvious and that we can stop these people

936
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:58,655
So I'm giving this a little bit of short shrift

937
00:45:58,911 --> 00:45:59,935
As we're getting

938
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:03,007
Into this episode where you know he's talked about Saul proven

939
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:09,663
Because a little bit later this episode we will see Alex

940
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:14,015
Really formulate and uncompressed down into a

941
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:17,343
Digestible form

942
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:21,183
Pieces of the narrative standard model yet laid out

943
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:27,327
We were just on the episode that comes out today of cognitive dissonance

944
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:31,679
Cute snakes

945
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:34,239
But on that episode

946
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:38,335
We discussed Alex's coronavirus narratives is what does theories are

947
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:39,871
And my response was

948
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:40,895
Along the lines of

949
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:42,687
He's all over the

950
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:44,735
Say anything that's probably something

951
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:49,343
I believe that on this episode what we look at is

952
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:50,623
I really solidify

953
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,671
Of the the narrative

954
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:53,439
A Guinea

955
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:56,255
Ignoring and not worrying about

956
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:57,023
Some of the

957
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:58,047
External things

958
00:46:58,303 --> 00:46:59,327
Anxiety disorder

959
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:00,351
Distractions just getting

960
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:01,887
Get down to what's important

961
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:06,239
So I'm saving a bit of discussion of that for that cuz all of its going to

962
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:08,287
So Alec

963
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:12,639
Let's get down to business talking about how Trump is doing great

964
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:18,783
And you got to really be you got to be really reaching for a positive Trump women

965
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:23,135
But Alex is hoping in this club but I think is really important

966
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:24,159
And I think it damaged

967
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:25,439
Straight

968
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:26,207
Other aware

969
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:27,999
That he has about what

970
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:28,767
He does for a

971
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:31,071
And if we fail this test

972
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:33,631
You're going to be ruled by the threat

973
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:37,215
Unending invisible bio

974
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:37,983
Weapons

975
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:48,223
Remote control for a long time and the globalist brags all these locations are going to use

976
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:49,503
The threat of mass

977
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:54,111
You know all that

978
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:55,647
It's obvious

979
00:47:58,719 --> 00:47:59,231
But

980
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:03,327
Scale

981
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:07,679
And I'll tell you the only person I see is the world leader

982
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:13,823
That is not going along with this and that it's farted and it was shot through it is Trump

983
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:17,151
Emily knows exactly what's going on

984
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:19,967
Inside

985
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:22,271
Trichomes are linked up with another side

986
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:27,135
The Taiwan embarrassment

987
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:31,743
And then try to topwater economy that's all about that

988
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:36,863
Virus

989
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:49,919
Dragonball from when it's known to be man-made

990
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:51,199
Close

991
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:54,015
So I think there's something really teachable

992
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:55,551
Side vent clip

993
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:58,623
Like a lot of it is meaningless nonsense but I

994
00:48:58,879 --> 00:49:05,023
I think you showed a little bit too much of his cards there when he says if we don't get the narrative out on a mass scale we're screwed

995
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:09,375
What's revealing about that is Alex he's what he does is putting out narrative

996
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:10,655
Just as I am

997
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:13,727
See what he does iic it exactly the same way

998
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:16,799
He's not putting out reality he's telling a story

999
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:20,383
Any needs that story to spread in order for people to fall into his marketing

1000
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:23,711
At least on a regular level that's the case

1001
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:24,735
Pino's

1002
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:26,271
You know that he's pushing a narrative

1003
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:27,039
It's just talk

1004
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:31,647
But when Alex has something like if we don't get at this narrative we're screwed

1005
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:33,695
It's important to consider what he's actually saying

1006
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:39,327
The Nativity needs to get out of the idea that the globalist they're behind this release of a man-made biof

1007
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:42,655
Which is designed to crash the US economy and get Trump out of office

1008
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:44,191
That's the narrative that he needs to

1009
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:45,215
Describe

1010
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:46,495
Kind of obvious why

1011
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:48,799
Alex is really saying here is that

1012
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:53,919
Reality is going to look damning in hindsight some preemptive damage control

1013
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:55,199
I have a narrative in place

1014
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:56,991
Explains away all of

1015
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:58,783
The things that Trump didn't do

1016
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:00,831
All of the failures and response

1017
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:02,367
That is

1018
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:03,647
That's all he saying

1019
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:10,047
If we don't get this narrative out realities going to look really f****** bad guys and our entire philosophy

1020
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:11,839
The government not doing anything

1021
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:14,655
And maybe the federal government not existing

1022
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:16,703
That is going to look

1023
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:17,471
Like

1024
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:20,031
They're going to almost be in exact

1025
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:22,335
Example of why that's a bad

1026
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:24,383
Way to organize Society

1027
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:25,919
And you can tell that he

1028
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:27,199
He is like

1029
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:28,479
I don't hear his heart

1030
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:30,271
Like he not like

1031
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:31,807
There's no way that you can

1032
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:32,575
Straight faces

1033
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:33,343
Dudley say that we

1034
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:36,671
Trump is doing a good job like younger

1035
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:44,351
World leader who's doing a great job what about boosie boo boo

1036
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:50,751
So I don't know

1037
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:52,287
It's it's weird

1038
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:53,567
Anyway

1039
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:57,919
He has said in the past we think a bit more now

1040
00:50:58,175 --> 00:51:00,479
And that is that this virus is a chimera

1041
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:02,783
It was like Skype

1042
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:04,063
The word

1043
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:06,111
So he talks about that

1044
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:08,671
It's a but it's secretly not a virus

1045
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:12,767
This is a ton of viruses

1046
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:17,631
Cuz get mutates into different chimeras

1047
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:21,727
There's been a bunch of different versions ever released

1048
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:28,639
Are texting right now our response to see they can lock us down

1049
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:35,039
And we lock down properly then they're going to release the real Bayou version will then start wife

1050
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:41,439
Global depopulation operation

1051
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:45,535
Terminate you and your family get change

1052
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:48,863
Dramatic

1053
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:50,911
He says the virus

1054
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:51,935
Is a bunch of different viruses

1055
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:53,983
Susannah Kami Wright the real viruses virus

1056
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:57,567
Get back to what he was talking about earlier we got chills talking about the

1057
00:51:58,591 --> 00:51:59,615
What is lying about it

1058
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:01,151
Some preliminary studies out of China

1059
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:03,455
According to the South China Morning Post

1060
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:05,759
Researchers were finding that there were very

1061
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:07,295
Stickley relevant drops

1062
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:10,623
Send some of the early symptoms of the virus and patients who tested positive

1063
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:12,415
Poster January 23rd

1064
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:14,207
I suppose those who tested positive

1065
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:20,351
What are the theories that's been put forth by the researchers is that early on the virus had to strain

1066
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:22,399
One be more aggressive than the other

1067
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:23,679
What symptoms showing up

1068
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:24,447
Pretty noticeable

1069
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:29,055
The quarantine that was placed on areas of China created very strong selective pressure

1070
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:31,359
Against the spread of the more aggressive version

1071
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:32,895
Send it would have been noticed much

1072
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:33,663
Much more easily

1073
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:35,455
If their numbers are correct

1074
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:36,223
This makes

1075
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:42,111
Some sense given that their samples reflect a drop from the aggressive strain being 96% of the samples

1076
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:45,951
Collected prior to 2000 January 23rd

1077
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:47,487
60% of the samples collect

1078
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:48,255
Did actor

1079
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:52,095
It should be pointed out though that their dissenting opinions about this research

1080
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:56,191
And it's not even accepted as established fact that there are two strains of the virus

1081
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:59,519
Even if the proposed 2strains hypothesis is

1082
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:01,311
Correct according to an op-ed in

1083
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:02,591
CNN

1084
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:04,127
Professor in the department of

1085
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:05,151
Epidemiology

1086
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:08,991
And microbial diseases at Yale public school public health

1087
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:13,343
Quote the two proposed S&L coronavirus strains

1088
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:14,879
Only differ by two mutations

1089
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:16,671
And are 99.99

1090
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:17,695
3% identical

1091
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:19,999
It's extremely likely that any vaccine

1092
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:22,559
Design for one coronavirus will be protective of

1093
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:23,327
Against the other

1094
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:26,655
I hear that guy's expertise and

1095
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:28,447
And it does seem comforting but I would like

1096
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:29,215
Like to know what

1097
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:30,495
Somebody and their guts

1098
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:31,263
Feel about it

1099
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:32,543
Well we already heard that

1100
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:34,591
DJ guy in Texas

1101
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:35,359
Does yelling

1102
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:37,407
Well I'm going to listen to the gut

1103
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:38,175
Chirped

1104
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:42,527
Viruses mutate because they make mistakes and replication when they're copying their RNA

1105
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:43,551
These mutations

1106
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:46,879
Can have basically no effect on their characteristics or they can have

1107
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:50,719
Effects that are either advantageous or disadvantageous to the virus

1108
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:54,303
However some things that would appear advantageous to a virus

1109
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:56,351
Might actually be detrimental to it

1110
00:53:56,863 --> 00:54:00,447
Mutation that makes a virus more aggressive can I have the effective

1111
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:01,727
Debilitating The Host

1112
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:05,055
It makes them less likely to spread the virus to others

1113
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:07,103
It would be disadvantageous to

1114
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:07,871
From the virus

1115
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:11,199
Just like if you have laser eyes

1116
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:12,479
Sure that's cool but you

1117
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:13,503
You can never look at the

1118
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:18,879
The people you love without wearing glasses very difficult about that

1119
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:21,439
Cartoony drawing

1120
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:30,399
There's a complicated interconnectedness when you look at virus mutation and in the case of the current outbreak there's just not enough in for

1121
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:32,447
Formation to make a concrete assessment about any of it

1122
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:36,799
Over Alex's headlines about these two strains and he's determined

1123
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:38,591
But that's proof

1124
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:41,407
Secretly a ton of different viruses in one

1125
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:42,687
Is is right

1126
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:43,711
He's just dumb

1127
00:54:44,223 --> 00:54:46,015
Interesting lead is very closely mirrors

1128
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:48,319
Conspiracy theory that was promoted by Russian

1129
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:50,879
Can scientists after the 2003 SARS outbreak

1130
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:54,975
They claim that SARS is actually combination of measles and mumps Wichita

1131
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:55,743
Definitely was not

1132
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:59,583
This order theory is pretty common in propaganda circles whenever there's an outbreak

1133
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:01,375
That's a very human impulse

1134
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:02,911
Do I

1135
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:04,191
Facebook

1136
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:04,959
With uncertainty

1137
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:08,799
There's a need to craft a narrative and a concrete villain out of the situation

1138
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:09,567
Where

1139
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:10,847
Might just be human failing

1140
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:12,895
And we fall into that

1141
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:17,503
The same issue it's with Avengers movies you know we already have measles that's not

1142
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:19,039
Scary enough sir

1143
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:20,319
We need measles is

1144
00:55:20,575 --> 00:55:25,183
You need the bad guy to be escalated

1145
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:28,511
Also when Alex has at the end there it came out of Wuhan

1146
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:30,815
That's a contradiction of his established

1147
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:31,839
Conspiracy about this

1148
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:35,167
It didn't come out of Wuhan according to Alex it came out of UNC

1149
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:37,727
Chapel Hill and Obama sold it to the Chinese

1150
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:40,799
He's just trying to say something you thought so too deep and

1151
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:41,823
Profound

1152
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:43,359
Contemplatively does whip

1153
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:49,503
It did it did have a did have a tagline kind of feel to it though it came from

1154
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:50,527
That's not bad

1155
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:56,927
No movie on top is it at

1156
00:55:57,183 --> 00:56:02,047
Line on the back of one of the sci-fi novels he read and bases world you are awesome

1157
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:04,607
It's contradictory

1158
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:06,143
Position

1159
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:09,215
Alex gets back to rambling about how he's the

1160
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:11,007
The victim of driving drunk

1161
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:18,431
I'm sure there's a concrete example.

1162
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:19,455
CIA

1163
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:21,503
Mockingbird operation is out to get it

1164
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:28,159
I'll show you a photo that was sent to me by one of my friends his dad on a cruise

1165
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:30,719
Cab off the coast of South Africa

1166
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:38,911
Terrorist

1167
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:41,471
Cruisers

1168
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:44,031
Bass

1169
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:46,847
They have a article about Alex Jones

1170
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:49,663
Twi

1171
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:50,687
There it is

1172
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:52,223
Why would that

1173
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:55,039
Be on a cruise ship out of South Africa

1174
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:08,095
Published operation Mockingbird what it's called

1175
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:13,215
In every newspaper in the world that's affiliated with it and every broadcast system

1176
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:17,567
Every newspaper

1177
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:22,687
System

1178
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:26,015
Horse Eye blue under

1179
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:27,039
Illegal lemon

1180
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:33,951
I text you at the jail so I had to be taken to jail it's ridiculous

1181
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:35,487
A will do that to you

1182
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:39,327
Alex is so desperate to find another narrative here other than I got it

1183
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:40,095
Vwi

1184
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:45,727
And I guess the best I can come up with his people reporting on my DWI is proof the CIA is trying to get

1185
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:48,543
Yeah I got a little lame and weak

1186
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:49,567
But whatever he needs

1187
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:51,615
To do not to face reality is what he's going

1188
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:52,383
Going to do

1189
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:57,503
So Alex flashes up on camera this picture that someone sent him and it's just a shot of like a

1190
00:57:57,759 --> 00:57:59,807
I printed out newsletter kind of thing

1191
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:05,183
It doesn't say the name of the papers that introduced a little bit of difficulty in figuring out exactly who he was

1192
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:07,231
Being a Mockingbird CIA Shields

1193
00:58:07,999 --> 00:58:09,279
But the picture did give me one

1194
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:13,375
In the upper right-hand corner of the page and said kvh media

1195
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:15,679
Who are clearly the producers of this newsletter

1196
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:18,239
I thought kvh's filing with it

1197
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:19,519
Security Exchange Commission

1198
00:58:19,775 --> 00:58:20,287
According to

1199
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:21,311
The descriptions of busy

1200
00:58:21,823 --> 00:58:23,359
They are quote

1201
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:25,663
A leading provider of commercially license

1202
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:27,455
Entertainment including News sports

1203
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:28,735
Music and movies

1204
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:30,527
Commercial and Leisure customers

1205
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:32,831
In the maritime hotel and Retail Market

1206
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:35,647
This is a company that provides broadband

1207
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:36,927
A cruise ships and resorts

1208
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:37,695
And also news

1209
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:42,559
One thing that confuses me though is that I'm not sure that they send

1210
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:43,839
Physical newspapers

1211
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:44,607
Cruise ships

1212
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:47,679
That seems almost prohibitively expensive and difficult

1213
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:50,751
Especially considering they say they primarily offer a quote

1214
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:52,543
News from home digital newspaper

1215
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:53,311
Paper service

1216
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:57,151
That includes more than 100 daily newspapers and more than 20 languages

1217
00:58:57,663 --> 00:59:00,991
That at the end of 2015 was delivered more than

1218
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:02,015
8500

1219
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:02,783
Commercial ships

1220
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:03,551
Hotels

1221
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:04,319
And cruise ships

1222
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:09,183
Digital content can be printed on board or viewed on a tablet smartphone or left

1223
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:12,767
I remember playing Paperboy on Game Boy you used to

1224
00:59:13,023 --> 00:59:13,535
To deliver paper

1225
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:15,071
Do cruise ships all the

1226
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:15,839
Hyman that

1227
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:16,863
That was the last

1228
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:18,911
Last level is very difficult

1229
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:23,519
Dogs and then throw papers into the ocean was like the boss

1230
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:27,103
So I took another look at that picture Alex as I noticed something peculiar

1231
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:30,687
The blurb about Alex is just an AP article syndicated through this

1232
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:31,711
Just kvh portal

1233
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:35,551
The article right after it is cooked Coachella festival postponed

1234
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:37,855
Also syndicated from the associated

1235
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:38,623
Depress

1236
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:41,183
There's another article about Harvey Weinstein Center

1237
00:59:41,439 --> 00:59:42,719
Something which appears to be syndicated from

1238
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:43,743
Aafp

1239
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:45,535
What's going on

1240
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:46,303
Yes

1241
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:47,839
This is a publication called news

1242
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:49,887
And it's just an aggregation of news

1243
00:59:50,143 --> 00:59:51,679
From large newswires around the world

1244
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:53,727
Newslink has a ton of options

1245
00:59:53,983 --> 00:59:55,263
And then what they have

1246
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:56,543
How Works basically

1247
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:57,567
Is it they have

1248
00:59:58,079 --> 00:59:58,847
Approximately

1249
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:00,127
100 different option

1250
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:02,431
Prepackaged newsletters

1251
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:03,967
Should are just aggregation

1252
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:05,759
Oceans of Lake if you want

1253
01:00:06,015 --> 01:00:08,575
What kind of focus do you want are you a cricket

1254
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:14,975
Sports will give you Cricket award for

1255
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:16,255
It's the one I'm using

1256
01:00:16,511 --> 01:00:17,535
Is like if you have

1257
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:19,327
Accrue

1258
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:20,863
A bunch of people who are from the Philippines

1259
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:22,399
Score on this cruise ship

1260
01:00:22,655 --> 01:00:25,727
They will have news that Centric to the Filipino Audi

1261
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:29,567
That's smart rights they have a ton of these options

1262
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:31,103
But also

1263
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:33,407
People on board the cruise ship can customize

1264
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:34,943
So you can make

1265
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:36,735
Make your own newsletter the Taylor's at

1266
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:38,271
Itself to the audience

1267
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:41,343
People that you have on the boat

1268
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:47,999
I don't know what's going on here exactly where there anything a cruise can't turn into a buffet dad is there anything

1269
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:49,023
Lockhart

1270
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:52,351
So I don't know if this is necessarily it's got a Mockingbird operation

1271
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:56,703
Associated Press story about Alex getting a DWI

1272
01:00:56,959 --> 01:00:59,263
Specific cruise ship decided to include in their newsletter

1273
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:02,591
Or it was part of one of the package

1274
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:03,359
Newsletters

1275
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:04,383
I'm not entirely sure

1276
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:06,431
Alex wants to make this a nefarious

1277
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:08,479
Conspiracy the only bad guy I guess

1278
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:09,503
Kvh

1279
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:11,551
Which media if you want to say that or

1280
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:13,087
Captain of this ship or whatever

1281
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:14,111
Who's in charge of the

1282
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:15,391
The newsletter on that ship

1283
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:16,671
I don't know if this is a week

1284
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:20,255
Wheat beers at the AP is run by the

1285
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:22,047
That's really his only

1286
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:25,887
I mean I guess if he wants to take that swing

1287
01:01:26,143 --> 01:01:26,655
Go for it

1288
01:01:28,703 --> 01:01:29,983
I'm fine with that whatever

1289
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:31,263
Alex

1290
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:32,799
But here's the problem

1291
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:35,103
If the AP is run by

1292
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:37,151
The CIA he should just say that

1293
01:01:37,663 --> 01:01:40,991
Instead he's using this bulletin on a South African

1294
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:44,575
Cruise ship as his example

1295
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:50,975
Right there's too many steps removed for the accusation to be that it's evil

1296
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:51,999
Something about the cinder

1297
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:54,303
Indication of this news Ryan

1298
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:55,327
And the steps

1299
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:58,143
So you have to go through either the captain or JV

1300
01:01:58,911 --> 01:02:01,727
Choose whoever you want to slander Alex girlfriend

1301
01:02:01,983 --> 01:02:02,495
Question

1302
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:03,263
Was the

1303
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:05,055
I don't know

1304
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:06,079
It is not

1305
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:07,359
His name was Phillips

1306
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:10,431
So Alex gets back to being

1307
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:11,199
Sensitive

1308
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:11,967
About

1309
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:13,247
Selling his silver

1310
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:14,783
In terms of e virus

1311
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:17,087
Pizza Town

1312
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:23,231
On-air the fact that

1313
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:25,535
Hospitals have nanosilver

1314
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:30,655
You go to CVS now they got a whole section of silver

1315
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:34,751
Everybody knows silver kills a virus a bacteria

1316
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:37,055
Resale

1317
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:37,823
Different

1318
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:40,639
Silver's not alive

1319
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:41,407
Nanotech

1320
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:53,439
And in the media thinks everybody said during those old Jones claims he can cure the coronavirus not ever said that

1321
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:55,487
You had the virus replicate

1322
01:02:58,815 --> 01:03:04,191
Personally gargle with it knocks it out on contact that's a good for

1323
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:05,983
Okay well here's a little clip

1324
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:07,263
Alex

1325
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:09,567
It's over in ways that are probably not

1326
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:14,431
That we sold out of the 16oz of your guard over the nanosilver the stock meditech

1327
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:15,967
Coronavirus

1328
01:03:17,503 --> 01:03:20,063
I was if I was going to Taiwan

1329
01:03:20,575 --> 01:03:21,599
I'd be guzzling

1330
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:23,903
Banana platinum silver weave

1331
01:03:25,183 --> 01:03:25,695
Sorry

1332
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:27,487
Brush your teeth

1333
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:32,095
Bio silver

1334
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:35,167
From the Pentagon that knocks out

1335
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:38,495
Thesaurus coronavirus family

1336
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:40,543
Security in the air

1337
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:49,247
Found with and receive on

1338
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:58,463
The SARS virus was the coronavirus man-made others that 12

1339
01:03:58,719 --> 01:03:59,487
What's in our

1340
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:01,023
Super Silver

1341
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:05,887
Hardly ever get sex

1342
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:08,191
Getting sick last week for me and Arlo

1343
01:04:08,447 --> 01:04:08,959
Dawn

1344
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:12,287
So I think that what you have

1345
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:13,055
Is

1346
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:15,359
I guess Alex is main defense

1347
01:04:15,615 --> 01:04:16,127
Is like

1348
01:04:16,383 --> 01:04:19,199
What is a knockout mean

1349
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:25,599
Take out Pirates I didn't say that it would take it out of your body I just said it would take it out on a nice

1350
01:04:25,855 --> 01:04:26,367
Little date

1351
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:30,207
I think that you could make a pretty compelling case

1352
01:04:30,463 --> 01:04:31,743
That the way that wasn't

1353
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:33,535
Intended to be heard by the audience

1354
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:37,631
Because you can't really knock something out if it's not there

1355
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:38,399
Right

1356
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:42,751
Ethan Hawke took her out on a date in before midnight it was a

1357
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:45,823
He took her out you know it wasn't the Killer

1358
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:48,383
She was present

1359
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:49,151
That's true

1360
01:04:50,175 --> 01:04:51,967
Find me spoilers

1361
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:54,015
Some emotional troubles

1362
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:56,063
So I don't

1363
01:04:57,343 --> 01:04:57,855
Compelling argument

1364
01:04:58,111 --> 01:04:58,623
He's make

1365
01:04:58,879 --> 01:05:01,183
Getting here and he tries to

1366
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:02,463
Claim like

1367
01:05:02,975 --> 01:05:08,095
I've been selling this silver exactly the same way before the Opera

1368
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:11,167
Which I know is not active big sweater this is

1369
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:12,959
Really really layered

1370
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:16,031
Oh no he just came Fly by Night

1371
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:20,127
Really before this whole thing popped up

1372
01:05:21,407 --> 01:05:23,199
I showed you this

1373
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:25,247
Tabs

1374
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:31,903
Apopka right now sitting out season desist letter to the

1375
01:05:42,143 --> 01:05:44,959
Keith Mueller American biotech labs

1376
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:50,335
And then we got their letters here from 13 years ago Texas A&M University

1377
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:52,383
Symptoms Health Science Center

1378
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:55,199
What they found was there

1379
01:05:55,711 --> 01:05:56,735
Nano silver

1380
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:57,759
Taking out

1381
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:03,135
The tsar's family family I don't know how one but that's kind of

1382
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:06,207
Dancing like a pesticide kill cockroaches

1383
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:11,327
Salinas fair for Alex to say that he was like selling his immune gargle and the toothpaste

1384
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:12,095
Prior

1385
01:06:12,351 --> 01:06:13,631
That's true

1386
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:15,167
But it was telling it the same way

1387
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:19,263
Clippity brought out these studies and these

1388
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:21,567
These letters vdi Pryor

1389
01:06:21,823 --> 01:06:22,335
To the

1390
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:23,103
And that's not

1391
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:28,223
Play Supercut of him selling it irresponsibly I assume that

1392
01:06:28,479 --> 01:06:29,503
Do you have a full suit

1393
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:30,527
I'm not doing

1394
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:33,343
I don't know what that would look like but here it is

1395
01:06:35,135 --> 01:06:36,927
Alex brought up

1396
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:41,023
These studies about the effectiveness of the nanosilver Visa vie

1397
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:42,559
Thesaurus family

1398
01:06:42,815 --> 01:06:45,375
That was on January 31st 2020

1399
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:48,703
Even says on that app

1400
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:49,471
So that he

1401
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:50,495
Just been cleared

1402
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:51,519
To discuss this stuff

1403
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:54,079
Brutally cleared by his silver supplier

1404
01:06:54,591 --> 01:06:55,103
Yes

1405
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:56,895
American biotech labs

1406
01:06:57,663 --> 01:06:58,943
And that makes some sense

1407
01:06:59,455 --> 01:07:01,247
You know how every time Alex pulls out the

1408
01:07:01,503 --> 01:07:06,111
This piece of evidence he begins with the name Doctor Keith Mueller as you heard In that clip right there course

1409
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:08,671
That's because the top document his stack

1410
01:07:08,927 --> 01:07:10,975
Mysuu Versailles stack

1411
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:13,023
Is an email from doctor

1412
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:14,559
Keith Mueller who's the CEO

1413
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:16,095
American biotech labs

1414
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:17,887
The email reads quote

1415
01:07:18,143 --> 01:07:24,031
The report is the coronavirus is like the SARS virus and Homeland Security put out the data that our product could kill them

1416
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:28,127
TV above lateral from the director of the Homeland Security

1417
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:28,895
The secretary

1418
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:33,503
Dr. Carlton is a brilliant man who came up with the Mobile hospital system

1419
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:38,111
We only received a copy of it because our testimony before Congress on balearia and it was

1420
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:38,879
Included as an

1421
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:40,159
An addendum to that testimony

1422
01:07:40,671 --> 01:07:44,511
We never received a good copy but we did get a copy and it's worth the reading on the

1423
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:46,303
The claims they make about our product

1424
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:50,655
This should be pointed out is not an email address to Alex

1425
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:53,471
It's addressed to someone named Ken and another person named

1426
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:54,239
Kimball

1427
01:07:54,495 --> 01:07:57,823
Kimball is shown in the email to be Kimball Mueller

1428
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:02,943
Who is listed as the Eastern Us sales rep for silver biotics there Silver Line

1429
01:08:03,455 --> 01:08:06,271
I'm not sure who can is but I would assume that it's someone else who work

1430
01:08:06,527 --> 01:08:09,599
Works with American biotech labs and the silver biotics

1431
01:08:10,623 --> 01:08:12,671
That email is about the silver

1432
01:08:12,927 --> 01:08:14,207
As you can tell from the attached

1433
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:15,999
Letter that that email refers to

1434
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:19,071
This is not the same as saying that the Homeland

1435
01:08:19,327 --> 01:08:20,863
Security found that the gargle

1436
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:21,887
I said nef

1437
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:23,423
Cassie against sars-like virus

1438
01:08:24,959 --> 01:08:25,983
Weather in Arden Hills

1439
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:26,751
Same silver

1440
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:31,615
This information cannot be used to justify those sorts of claims and if Alex tries to use this in court

1441
01:08:31,871 --> 01:08:32,895
You going to lose that case

1442
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:36,991
Those imaginary cease-and-desist letters that he's going to send out are going to do s***

1443
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:40,319
This is Alex threatening to sue the Associated Press all over it

1444
01:08:42,111 --> 01:08:43,903
Also you may notice that

1445
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:47,487
The email from dr. Mueller starts quote the report is that the

1446
01:08:47,743 --> 01:08:48,255
The Coronavirus

1447
01:08:48,511 --> 01:08:49,279
Is like the Stars by

1448
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:51,327
Witcher tell you that this information was

1449
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:52,095
Was created

1450
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:53,375
After the outbreak begin

1451
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:54,399
You can

1452
01:08:54,655 --> 01:08:55,423
Clearly see a date

1453
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:56,703
January 24th

1454
01:08:56,959 --> 01:08:57,983
20/20 on the

1455
01:08:58,239 --> 01:08:58,751
Email

1456
01:08:59,263 --> 01:09:02,591
Tracks with the timeline of Alex receiving this from someone a few days later

1457
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:05,151
And then bring it on air on January 31st

1458
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:06,687
It's important

1459
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:08,223
I want to pretend that is sales tax

1460
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:09,503
Predate the outbreak

1461
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:10,527
Because if he's

1462
01:09:11,551 --> 01:09:13,087
Opportunistically selling the silver

1463
01:09:13,343 --> 01:09:15,391
Response to an outbreak that makes him look like what he is

1464
01:09:15,647 --> 01:09:16,159
Con man

1465
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:21,279
Unfortunately I wasn't do this you and I know for a fact that he began in response to the outbreak

1466
01:09:21,535 --> 01:09:22,303
Behaving this way

1467
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:23,583
And Alex is on document

1468
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:25,631
Proof is that date on the email is

1469
01:09:26,143 --> 01:09:27,167
Pretty f****** thing

1470
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:29,215
This email didn't exist

1471
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:31,007
Prior to January 24th

1472
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:32,031
How Alec

1473
01:09:32,287 --> 01:09:33,311
TxDOT the document

1474
01:09:33,823 --> 01:09:35,359
These quote-unquote cleared

1475
01:09:35,615 --> 01:09:36,383
To bring to the air

1476
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:37,151
Time travel

1477
01:09:40,735 --> 01:09:42,527
His defense in court that's what I would

1478
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:48,927
That's a better argument than what he always does

1479
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:51,487
Family brings out his strawman friend he was off-planet

1480
01:09:51,743 --> 01:09:55,839
Department of the Army Headquarters United States

1481
01:09:56,351 --> 01:09:57,631
Where's the

1482
01:09:58,399 --> 01:09:59,679
Hm

1483
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:01,727
30 years ago

1484
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:07,103
The FDA says you're not supposed to say you need oxygen to live

1485
01:10:08,895 --> 01:10:11,455
Not said you need water to live

1486
01:10:11,711 --> 01:10:17,855
These are these standards, Anthony bring out whenever he's a you know a position where he looks really bad

1487
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:20,415
Mike Adams

1488
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:21,695
Comes on to help Ranger

1489
01:10:22,207 --> 01:10:22,719
Our good buddy

1490
01:10:23,743 --> 01:10:24,767
Not a good buddy

1491
01:10:25,023 --> 01:10:27,839
He comes on and what he does immediately out of the gate

1492
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:29,375
Is defend Alex

1493
01:10:29,631 --> 01:10:30,655
About the criticism

1494
01:10:30,911 --> 01:10:31,423
But he's getting

1495
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:32,447
For the silver sale

1496
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:33,727
This f****** guy

1497
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:34,751
Now you tell you

1498
01:10:35,263 --> 01:10:35,775
He is no help for it

1499
01:10:36,287 --> 01:10:37,311
Your comments on

1500
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:40,639
Silver and copper I just want to mention new research

1501
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:44,479
About how long coronavirus survive on surfaces

1502
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:51,135
Real quick Altos not talk about copper only talk about silver together

1503
01:10:51,391 --> 01:10:54,463
Bring it all in there all precious metals copper surfaces

1504
01:10:54,719 --> 01:11:00,863
An hour's whereas the virus survivors from many days up to nine days on other services such as cardboard

1505
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:02,143
Are plastic or others

1506
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:04,703
And silver is known to it to kill

1507
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:08,799
The viability of viruses and kill bacteria even more aggressively

1508
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:09,567
Copper

1509
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:14,175
Estimation as an elemental scientist

1510
01:11:14,431 --> 01:11:17,503
We deal with almonds all the time we run microbiology as well

1511
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:21,855
Uber would probably kill this virus on surfaces

1512
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:23,391
Copper

1513
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:29,791
Anyone saying that silver doesn't work against the coronavirus is their minds or just a literate

1514
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:31,327
And also I'm an alchemist

1515
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:37,727
My friend Jack Parsons was an elemental scientist and you sir are no Jack Parson

1516
01:11:37,983 --> 01:11:43,615
Like is referring to a recent not yet. Viewed study that looked at how long coronavirus could survive in very good condition

1517
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:45,407
Including on various surfaces

1518
01:11:46,175 --> 01:11:48,735
Here's where the first problem with Mike's comments pop up

1519
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:51,039
Silver was not one of the surfaces they test

1520
01:11:51,295 --> 01:11:52,831
So this study does not really helping

1521
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:53,599
That doesn't

1522
01:11:53,855 --> 01:11:55,647
In their testing they found that the viruses

1523
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:57,951
Detectable for four hours or so on

1524
01:11:58,207 --> 01:12:00,767
Copper as opposed to 24 hours on cardboard

1525
01:12:01,023 --> 01:12:02,047
And 72 hours

1526
01:12:02,303 --> 01:12:03,583
Plastic and stainless steel

1527
01:12:04,095 --> 01:12:06,655
This is useful information to have four people

1528
01:12:06,911 --> 01:12:09,471
And if the results stand up the peer-review it'll be a good

1529
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:10,751
To know about the virus

1530
01:12:11,263 --> 01:12:13,311
However the way mic is using this information

1531
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:14,591
He's completely f***** up

1532
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:18,431
He's coming on the show right after Alex gets super defensive about Hobbies

1533
01:12:18,687 --> 01:12:21,503
Being criticized for selling his ingestible silver ship

1534
01:12:22,015 --> 01:12:26,623
To make Alex feel better about the people rightly criticize and have bike pulls out their study that says it's

1535
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:30,975
Silver Ingot silver kills viruses more aggressively than copper

1536
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:32,255
Copper is in the sky

1537
01:12:32,767 --> 01:12:34,815
Mike is bringing silver into it for no reason

1538
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:36,863
Here's where the major problem

1539
01:12:37,887 --> 01:12:40,703
The study Micah siding is about viruses on Surface

1540
01:12:41,215 --> 01:12:41,983
It's not inside the body

1541
01:12:42,495 --> 01:12:45,823
If Alex were selling silver countertops then maybe this would be relevant

1542
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:51,455
Now there's literally no connection between the observed lifespan of a virus on copper

1543
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:52,479
India Sudafed

1544
01:12:52,991 --> 01:12:54,271
Eating silver will do to it

1545
01:12:54,783 --> 01:12:57,087
But if Mike really does want to make this connection

1546
01:12:57,343 --> 01:12:58,879
Wisely advised in his listeners to

1547
01:12:59,391 --> 01:12:59,903
Copper

1548
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:03,231
There's a Stephanie right there stating the copper kills virus faster than

1549
01:13:03,487 --> 01:13:03,999
Steel

1550
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:07,327
Should start eating 1976 pennies

1551
01:13:08,095 --> 01:13:09,631
You can't sell pennies to people

1552
01:13:09,887 --> 01:13:12,959
There is a lot of dirty value

1553
01:13:13,471 --> 01:13:17,311
If Micah sings should seriously he needs to turn in his health ranging badge

1554
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:20,383
Cuz this is pretty embarrassing to Elemental science

1555
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:22,943
It's full-time

1556
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:24,735
Elemental science

1557
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:28,319
What kind of a****** would say as an element

1558
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:32,927
Little scientist inferred from him so I'm going to let it slide

1559
01:13:33,183 --> 01:13:33,951
You come on

1560
01:13:34,463 --> 01:13:36,767
Jamaica some big news about the state of California

1561
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:38,559
And he wants Trump

1562
01:13:38,815 --> 01:13:40,607
Nobody wants Trump

1563
01:13:40,863 --> 01:13:41,375
Some military

1564
01:13:41,631 --> 01:13:43,167
Sacramento County

1565
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:45,727
Dropping all quarantines

1566
01:13:45,983 --> 01:13:50,335
No longer going to try to contain this there just releasing all high-risk patients right out to the public

1567
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:53,663
Doesn't sound right

1568
01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:55,711
I called for Trump

1569
01:13:56,223 --> 01:14:02,367
To declare National Emergency and literally dispatch the military to take over Sacramento

1570
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:06,975
County in order to re-establish basic medical principles

1571
01:14:07,231 --> 01:14:11,327
The modern era

1572
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:14,399
They're deliberately want to bring down Trump

1573
01:14:14,655 --> 01:14:19,775
By spreading the disease and infections sabotage

1574
01:14:20,287 --> 01:14:24,895
The part of Sacramento County

1575
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:27,455
It's not complacent

1576
01:14:29,759 --> 01:14:32,063
My curiously doesn't mention that YOLO in

1577
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:34,879
Placer County's in California are also doing the same

1578
01:14:35,135 --> 01:14:36,671
Same thing the Sacramento County

1579
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:41,535
I wonder if that's just because he's only read one headline on the story and decided to run with it is a narrative

1580
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:42,303
Probably

1581
01:14:43,071 --> 01:14:47,679
So this is situation where Sacramento County has decided that they're not going to impose a 14-day corn

1582
01:14:47,935 --> 01:14:51,007
19 on everyone who's come in contact with someone who has the virus

1583
01:14:51,775 --> 01:14:53,311
If you're sick you're still to isolate

1584
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:57,151
But if you came in contact with someone who ends up testing positive

1585
01:14:57,407 --> 01:14:57,919
The advice

1586
01:14:58,175 --> 01:14:59,711
Bi-County gibbet is giving now is

1587
01:15:00,991 --> 01:15:06,367
The full story here is at the head of Sacramento Sacramento County's Department of Health Services doctor

1588
01:15:06,623 --> 01:15:07,135
Peterbilt

1589
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:08,671
Bailenson

1590
01:15:09,183 --> 01:15:11,999
He decided that we're at the point where they need to dry

1591
01:15:12,255 --> 01:15:12,767
Different approach

1592
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:15,583
You determine that the county was past the point of reasonable can

1593
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:18,143
Containment and it reached a point where mitigation was

1594
01:15:18,399 --> 01:15:18,911
The main priority

1595
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:20,959
Have you told the Sacramento Bee

1596
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:23,519
Once you get a certain number of cases

1597
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:28,127
It's hard to continue contact Trace back the way that you tried initially

1598
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:29,151
Originally

1599
01:15:29,407 --> 01:15:30,943
Do we move to mitigate

1600
01:15:31,711 --> 01:15:34,783
Which is basically trying to mitigate the risk to those who are most at

1601
01:15:35,295 --> 01:15:37,343
The elderly and those with chronic underlying

1602
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:38,111
Conditions

1603
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:42,975
An epidemiologist interviewed for that article in the bee said that this shift in approach May

1604
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:43,743
Makes total sense

1605
01:15:44,255 --> 01:15:45,791
In early stages when you have a hope for

1606
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:48,607
But it's good to quarantine as many high likelihood person

1607
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:49,375
As you

1608
01:15:49,631 --> 01:15:50,143
You can't Raystown

1609
01:15:50,655 --> 01:15:53,983
Once there's enough cases that becomes prohibited from a resource Tamplin

1610
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:55,007
You need to try a different

1611
01:15:55,263 --> 01:15:56,799
Approach which these counties in California

1612
01:15:57,055 --> 01:15:57,567
Cornea are doing

1613
01:15:58,335 --> 01:16:01,407
Whatever your thoughts on this are it's not an attempt to spread the virus

1614
01:16:01,663 --> 01:16:03,199
And disorders narrative hitmaka

1615
01:16:03,455 --> 01:16:04,223
Spreading is really just

1616
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:04,991
Indicative

1617
01:16:05,247 --> 01:16:06,015
Desire to see Trump

1618
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:08,575
A brutal authoritarian Crackdown

1619
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:10,111
Ion people he doesn't

1620
01:16:10,623 --> 01:16:11,647
So you're telling me that

1621
01:16:11,903 --> 01:16:12,927
The city of Sacramento

1622
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:14,975
Did not get together and hold us

1623
01:16:15,231 --> 01:16:15,743
Secret vote

1624
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:19,583
To release all of their infected citizens

1625
01:16:20,095 --> 01:16:21,375
No in order to take down

1626
01:16:22,655 --> 01:16:23,679
That would be

1627
01:16:23,935 --> 01:16:26,751
However pretty amazing if Sacramento did

1628
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:29,823
Successfully taken a while

1629
01:16:30,079 --> 01:16:31,359
That'd be pretty cool

1630
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:33,407
In the United States California is the most

1631
01:16:33,663 --> 01:16:34,175
Heated state

1632
01:16:34,431 --> 01:16:38,015
It's two people like Mike and Alex

1633
01:16:38,271 --> 01:16:39,295
Pretext for Trump to place

1634
01:16:39,551 --> 01:16:41,087
The capital city on Durham

1635
01:16:41,343 --> 01:16:43,391
Military martial law

1636
01:16:43,647 --> 01:16:44,415
Those dudes Jack to

1637
01:16:44,671 --> 01:16:46,719
That's all that's really going on

1638
01:16:46,975 --> 01:16:47,487
Are you twisting

1639
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:54,143
Some story into being like they're trying to take out Trump

1640
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:55,423
Is the bad guy in

1641
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:56,703
This is terrible

1642
01:16:56,959 --> 01:16:58,495
So I thought that Mike talk

1643
01:16:58,751 --> 01:17:01,823
Think about the copper and silver defense

1644
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:03,103
Sprouts

1645
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:06,431
The things I've heard him say in a long time but he one-ups

1646
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:09,503
Another big factor in all this Alex

1647
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:12,831
This is a question do mosquitoes

1648
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:17,695
Parry this blood-borne disease mosquitoes spread this

1649
01:17:17,951 --> 01:17:24,095
That mosquitoes spread malaria plus diseases that are blood-borne

1650
01:17:24,351 --> 01:17:30,495
When mosquitoes bite you they actually suck some of your blood

1651
01:17:30,751 --> 01:17:32,287
That's how malaria spreads

1652
01:17:32,543 --> 01:17:36,639
Malaria is a virus of course I

1653
01:17:36,895 --> 01:17:38,687
Viruses are present in blood

1654
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:41,247
Can bacteria

1655
01:17:41,503 --> 01:17:44,575
Can mosquitoes spread that we don't know the answer to that yet

1656
01:17:45,087 --> 01:17:49,695
If you needed any reason to doubt likes credentials as a health Ranger there you go

1657
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:55,839
Illegitimately has no idea how mosquito borne illnesses are transmitted and yet here he is acting like an expert on the subject

1658
01:17:56,607 --> 01:17:59,679
What does indicates to me that he's never even looked into this

1659
01:18:00,447 --> 01:18:05,055
Because if he thinks while they're sucking your blood obviously little bit blood they drink earlier

1660
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:09,151
You later you take a sip of wine maybe you spill a little bit it's the same thing

1661
01:18:09,407 --> 01:18:10,687
If you look see if he thinks that he can

1662
01:18:10,943 --> 01:18:11,711
You possibly have looked in

1663
01:18:12,223 --> 01:18:15,039
Because if he did he would understand the 22 proboscis

1664
01:18:15,295 --> 01:18:17,087
The mosquitoes used to suck your blood

1665
01:18:17,343 --> 01:18:19,135
You understand that mosquito borne illness

1666
01:18:19,391 --> 01:18:22,207
Are not spread by the blood that mosquitoes drink previously

1667
01:18:22,463 --> 01:18:25,279
But what that blood could have infected the mosquito with

1668
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:30,655
Mosquitoes inject a little bit of their saliva into you when they bite you in this is how they transmit diseases like malaria

1669
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:33,215
If a particular disease cannot infect them

1670
01:18:33,471 --> 01:18:35,263
Mosquito and replicate in the Mosquito Lake

1671
01:18:35,519 --> 01:18:38,591
Cannot transmit that disease no matter what blooded drank earlier

1672
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:40,383
This is legitimately some basics

1673
01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:44,479
Stuff that Mike is 100% wrong about it's disqualifying

1674
01:18:44,735 --> 01:18:45,247
Being a helper

1675
01:18:46,015 --> 01:18:47,551
You can't be a health Ranger if you think

1676
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:48,319
This is

1677
01:18:48,575 --> 01:18:49,087
This is

1678
01:18:49,599 --> 01:18:52,159
Cambia Health Ranger if you have a first

1679
01:18:52,415 --> 01:18:54,975
First grade Anatomy textbook and then you just start make

1680
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:57,791
Well actually mosquitoes spread Disease by a psycho

1681
01:18:58,047 --> 01:18:59,839
Link with other mosquitoes who have contract

1682
01:19:00,095 --> 01:19:00,607
Active diseases

1683
01:19:00,863 --> 01:19:01,887
From of course the diner

1684
01:19:02,143 --> 01:19:03,935
And that's how we were all going to go

1685
01:19:04,447 --> 01:19:05,983
Valtrex perfect

1686
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:07,007
Totally clear

1687
01:19:07,263 --> 01:19:10,335
It may end up being the case but the virus will be able to

1688
01:19:10,847 --> 01:19:11,871
Transmitted by mosquitoes

1689
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:12,639
That might

1690
01:19:12,895 --> 01:19:13,407
Be the case

1691
01:19:13,919 --> 01:19:15,967
But there is no indication that that is

1692
01:19:16,223 --> 01:19:16,991
The case currently

1693
01:19:17,759 --> 01:19:18,527
There there

1694
01:19:18,783 --> 01:19:19,295
People who

1695
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:20,319
Understand this

1696
01:19:20,575 --> 01:19:21,343
Far better

1697
01:19:21,599 --> 01:19:23,903
They have sat there is no indications of present

1698
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:27,743
Sometime if this is something they can be transmitted by mosquitoes but

1699
01:19:31,071 --> 01:19:35,423
That's another May later be a point when they're so we might find that out

1700
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:36,959
Now this ship could get wild but

1701
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:41,055
This is something that Mike would only be saying she was trying to scare people at this

1702
01:19:41,567 --> 01:19:42,335
And if you

1703
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:44,127
Other possibilities

1704
01:19:44,383 --> 01:19:45,151
Literally knows nothing

1705
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:46,431
Thing is just talkingshit

1706
01:19:46,687 --> 01:19:47,199
Dragon sound like

1707
01:19:47,455 --> 01:19:47,967
He knows what he's talking about

1708
01:19:48,223 --> 01:19:48,991
Does he have a personal

1709
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:49,759
Grudge against

1710
01:19:50,527 --> 01:19:52,831
Yes he's been searching for a real California

1711
01:19:54,879 --> 01:19:55,903
So this virus

1712
01:19:56,415 --> 01:19:56,927
Is bad

1713
01:19:57,695 --> 01:19:58,463
To embarrass Trump

1714
01:19:58,975 --> 01:19:59,999
Mosquitoes are going to carry a tray

1715
01:20:00,255 --> 01:20:03,327
Bright copper copper if you want

1716
01:20:04,095 --> 01:20:04,607
But

1717
01:20:04,863 --> 01:20:05,887
It's really all just

1718
01:20:06,143 --> 01:20:06,655
Just about something

1719
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:08,191
According to Mike

1720
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:09,727
There's another stage

1721
01:20:09,983 --> 01:20:10,495
Used to this,

1722
01:20:11,007 --> 01:20:12,799
Okay it's not his other stage

1723
01:20:13,055 --> 01:20:14,592
Did he said before which was getting

1724
01:20:14,848 --> 01:20:16,640
Tricking Trump into canceling the Alexa

1725
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:18,176
The Dictator

1726
01:20:18,432 --> 01:20:20,224
Not that it's not that there's something else

1727
01:20:21,248 --> 01:20:23,040
This is nowhere near over

1728
01:20:23,296 --> 01:20:24,576
China's hoping that America

1729
01:20:24,832 --> 01:20:26,880
Collapses in terms of its infrastructure

1730
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:32,000
It's hospitals and its stock market

1731
01:20:32,256 --> 01:20:35,072
Once that happens China will unleash even more attacks

1732
01:20:35,328 --> 01:20:36,096
Possibly

1733
01:20:36,352 --> 01:20:37,632
In a worst-case scenario

1734
01:20:38,144 --> 01:20:38,656
An actual

1735
01:20:38,912 --> 01:20:39,680
Invasion

1736
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:43,776
America via California

1737
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:47,360
As realistic although it's it's pretty far down the road

1738
01:20:47,616 --> 01:20:49,408
Before they would even

1739
01:20:49,664 --> 01:20:54,784
I was I was very worried about

1740
01:20:55,808 --> 01:20:57,600
You know the thing about America that I've always

1741
01:20:58,112 --> 01:20:58,624
Concerned about is

1742
01:20:58,880 --> 01:20:59,392
Is Landon

1743
01:20:59,904 --> 01:21:01,696
That's one of those

1744
01:21:01,952 --> 01:21:03,488
Practical things that were always accept

1745
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,536
There's a there's a number reason

1746
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:07,584
Dump

1747
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:11,424
And it'll be really dumb by the end of this episode when this narrative has taken

1748
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:13,728
Re-emergence

1749
01:21:15,264 --> 01:21:16,288
Google

1750
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:17,312
Sure

1751
01:21:17,824 --> 01:21:19,360
There's a lot of stuff that's going on

1752
01:21:19,616 --> 01:21:20,640
Right in the news

1753
01:21:20,896 --> 01:21:21,920
That doesn't look good for Alex

1754
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:23,456
There's a lot of articles

1755
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:26,528
At this point on March 12th that are flying around about

1756
01:21:26,784 --> 01:21:28,832
I'm selling it supplements badly

1757
01:21:29,088 --> 01:21:30,368
Unethical

1758
01:21:31,392 --> 01:21:31,904
There is

1759
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:32,928
Lingering

1760
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:35,744
Headlines and articles about him getting arrested

1761
01:21:36,256 --> 01:21:37,536
.0 s78

1762
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:39,072
Irish people laughing about his

1763
01:21:39,328 --> 01:21:41,376
Defense of himself

1764
01:21:41,632 --> 01:21:42,144
Annoying

1765
01:21:42,656 --> 01:21:43,168
But look man

1766
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:49,568
It's all not true all those headlights are true

1767
01:21:49,824 --> 01:21:52,128
The attacks the lies and propaganda you can't believe

1768
01:21:52,384 --> 01:21:54,432
Any other

1769
01:22:01,344 --> 01:22:06,976
Is deception telling the truth infowars.com

1770
01:22:07,232 --> 01:22:10,560
It's perfect and if you can get people to believe that your golden

1771
01:22:10,816 --> 01:22:11,584
Cult leaders

1772
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:17,984
I always say the same s*** you know there's really only there's only a certain subset of things you can say if you're okay

1773
01:22:18,496 --> 01:22:23,104
That's because it works at clear pathway

1774
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:26,944
Clarity to being a cult leader I think where it's just like that black and white

1775
01:22:28,736 --> 01:22:30,784
For Millennia I'll just do what those guys

1776
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:31,552
Does did boo

1777
01:22:33,088 --> 01:22:35,136
So now Mike gets into

1778
01:22:35,648 --> 01:22:36,160
Oster

1779
01:22:36,672 --> 01:22:37,184
Rochelle

1780
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:38,720
And eat reiterate

1781
01:22:38,976 --> 01:22:39,488
That he wants

1782
01:22:39,744 --> 01:22:40,512
Everyone

1783
01:22:40,768 --> 01:22:43,328
All the officials in Sacramento to be arrested

1784
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:45,632
County

1785
01:22:45,888 --> 01:22:46,912
In California

1786
01:22:47,168 --> 01:22:51,264
Sacramento County deliberately engaging in criminal sabotage

1787
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:53,568
To spread this virus across America

1788
01:22:56,128 --> 01:22:58,432
President Trump to declare National Emergency

1789
01:22:58,688 --> 01:23:01,248
Send the military into Sacramento County

1790
01:23:01,504 --> 01:23:03,808
Seize control of the public health

1791
01:23:04,064 --> 01:23:05,600
Official

1792
01:23:05,856 --> 01:23:06,624
March them out

1793
01:23:07,136 --> 01:23:08,160
Prosecute them

1794
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:12,768
And re-establish basic modern medical common sense

1795
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:16,096
That's exactly what I'm calling for you can quote me on that

1796
01:23:16,352 --> 01:23:17,376
It has to be done

1797
01:23:17,632 --> 01:23:18,144
That's

1798
01:23:18,656 --> 01:23:19,168
Not a good

1799
01:23:19,424 --> 01:23:21,728
Quote me on this I would like

1800
01:23:21,984 --> 01:23:23,008
President-trump

1801
01:23:23,264 --> 01:23:25,824
To burn Sacramento to the ground

1802
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:28,128
Murder all of its citizens

1803
01:23:28,384 --> 01:23:29,920
Larrays the power ups

1804
01:23:30,176 --> 01:23:32,736
The heavens is a signal that modern metal

1805
01:23:33,248 --> 01:23:35,552
How we do things and then brighten

1806
01:23:35,808 --> 01:23:37,344
You're the rest of us

1807
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:39,904
Kidnap Gavin Newsom and making a gesture

1808
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:44,256
Yeah I don't know

1809
01:23:44,512 --> 01:23:45,792
I don't like

1810
01:23:46,048 --> 01:23:47,840
The trend is going

1811
01:23:48,864 --> 01:23:50,400
Mike is hurt

1812
01:23:50,656 --> 01:23:51,680
A lot of messaging

1813
01:23:52,192 --> 01:23:52,704
From

1814
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:54,496
Call Moorhead

1815
01:23:55,008 --> 01:23:57,312
They're saying hey man you don't need to get by

1816
01:23:57,568 --> 01:23:59,872
All the toilet paper you don't need

1817
01:24:00,128 --> 01:24:01,152
To do all that

1818
01:24:01,408 --> 01:24:03,200
That's bad because then

1819
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:04,224
It creates

1820
01:24:06,272 --> 01:24:07,808
Get toilet right there is an issue though

1821
01:24:08,064 --> 01:24:08,832
Marriott

1822
01:24:09,088 --> 01:24:09,856
Yes

1823
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:10,624
It's not

1824
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:11,648
And bikes

1825
01:24:11,904 --> 01:24:13,952
Things like hey man you all are hypocrites

1826
01:24:14,464 --> 01:24:17,792
And by the way wasn't the mainstream media telling us this whole time

1827
01:24:18,048 --> 01:24:19,072
Before all this

1828
01:24:19,328 --> 01:24:20,608
Everybody should buy more stuff

1829
01:24:20,864 --> 01:24:24,448
President Bush

1830
01:24:25,216 --> 01:24:25,984
Economy

1831
01:24:27,008 --> 01:24:31,104
You're always told to buy more stuff but then suddenly

1832
01:24:31,616 --> 01:24:32,640
What what

1833
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:34,176
Where does that come from

1834
01:24:34,688 --> 01:24:35,968
Buy more stuff

1835
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:37,760
Consumerism

1836
01:24:38,272 --> 01:24:39,552
Is the

1837
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:43,136
Complaint he has

1838
01:24:44,416 --> 01:24:49,280
What's the weather for talking about like after 9/11 okay as a long time ago

1839
01:24:49,536 --> 01:24:51,328
What you're not understanding

1840
01:24:51,584 --> 01:24:52,352
Is that when

1841
01:24:52,608 --> 01:24:54,656
Someone says something in one circumstance

1842
01:24:55,168 --> 01:24:56,960
And then the circumstances change

1843
01:24:57,216 --> 01:24:58,752
And then they say something different

1844
01:24:59,008 --> 01:24:59,776
Bet hip-hop

1845
01:25:00,288 --> 01:25:00,800
Sedan

1846
01:25:01,056 --> 01:25:03,360
But I understand that you know hey

1847
01:25:03,616 --> 01:25:06,432
This situation in 911 or both large

1848
01:25:06,944 --> 01:25:09,760
Lifestyle altering foursome foremost

1849
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:13,344
The circumstances that I can see how Mike would be like

1850
01:25:13,856 --> 01:25:16,416
Okay in the aftermath of the giant terrorist attack

1851
01:25:16,672 --> 01:25:17,696
President Bush

1852
01:25:17,952 --> 01:25:23,584
Came out and said everybody's got to buy stuff right so why are they saying that now because these are different

1853
01:25:24,608 --> 01:25:25,376
George Bush

1854
01:25:25,888 --> 01:25:28,192
Did come out and say after 9/11

1855
01:25:28,448 --> 01:25:29,472
Everyone

1856
01:25:29,728 --> 01:25:32,032
Should stockpile toilet paper

1857
01:25:32,288 --> 01:25:32,800
Incase

1858
01:25:33,312 --> 01:25:33,824
Terrorist

1859
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:36,640
Fly another plane into Walmart

1860
01:25:36,896 --> 01:25:39,200
I guess that's what I guess that would be what

1861
01:25:39,456 --> 01:25:41,248
Has to be the case to make an analog

1862
01:25:41,504 --> 01:25:42,272
Caroline you just

1863
01:25:42,528 --> 01:25:43,296
Is that all

1864
01:25:43,552 --> 01:25:44,832
That is incredibly

1865
01:25:45,088 --> 01:25:46,880
Stupid stupid thinking and you should be

1866
01:25:47,136 --> 01:25:50,976
Ashamed of yourself for saying something happens when Alex just leaves

1867
01:25:51,232 --> 01:25:53,280
Like my grandpa on his own for a while

1868
01:25:53,792 --> 01:25:54,304
Stupid things

1869
01:25:54,816 --> 01:25:57,376
Who might Mike hosted on his own for a little bit

1870
01:25:57,632 --> 01:25:58,912
And then Alex comes back

1871
01:25:59,168 --> 01:26:01,984
And there's a real trend of

1872
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:03,520
Him trying to make a joke

1873
01:26:04,032 --> 01:26:05,056
Out of his arrest

1874
01:26:05,312 --> 01:26:07,360
And you'll see that that starting

1875
01:26:07,616 --> 01:26:08,128
To begin here

1876
01:26:09,408 --> 01:26:13,504
Chinese restaurants around the Coronavirus

1877
01:26:15,296 --> 01:26:17,088
Japanese restaurant

1878
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:19,648
This rights the first

1879
01:26:19,904 --> 01:26:23,232
Again

1880
01:26:23,488 --> 01:26:25,024
See you'll see a good bit more

1881
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:30,144
I'm trying to I don't know if I want to call it reclaim

1882
01:26:31,168 --> 01:26:34,752
We're getting his if I did it here's how I would have done it

1883
01:26:35,264 --> 01:26:41,408
Well I mean I think there is a little bit of a I know that I've been I'm not going to get in any real trouble for

1884
01:26:41,664 --> 01:26:43,200
Glodan

1885
01:26:43,968 --> 01:26:44,736
And he's behaving

1886
01:26:45,248 --> 01:26:47,040
Fairly similarly about his silver

1887
01:26:48,576 --> 01:26:50,112
I'm saying topically

1888
01:26:50,368 --> 01:26:52,672
It makes contact with a virus

1889
01:26:53,184 --> 01:26:57,536
Silvers documented and understudies are solely gentle make your head spin and its back

1890
01:26:57,792 --> 01:26:58,816
20

1891
01:26:59,072 --> 01:26:59,840
Percent off

1892
01:27:00,096 --> 01:27:01,120
Infowars store

1893
01:27:01,376 --> 01:27:01,888
Dot-com

1894
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:06,752
So you're using very similar techniques and tactics

1895
01:27:07,008 --> 01:27:08,032
Some things that he said

1896
01:27:09,056 --> 01:27:11,616
That are the things that are being criticized by like this

1897
01:27:11,872 --> 01:27:12,640
Is Mother Jones article

1898
01:27:12,896 --> 01:27:14,432
It's almost like a come at me

1899
01:27:14,688 --> 01:27:15,200
See what he

1900
01:27:15,968 --> 01:27:16,992
I don't give a s***

1901
01:27:17,248 --> 01:27:18,016
This is this

1902
01:27:18,528 --> 01:27:19,040
A huge bail

1903
01:27:19,552 --> 01:27:20,576
Here because all that is

1904
01:27:20,832 --> 01:27:21,344
It seems like

1905
01:27:21,856 --> 01:27:22,368
The

1906
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:23,648
FDA

1907
01:27:28,256 --> 01:27:29,280
Attorney General

1908
01:27:31,072 --> 01:27:33,376
I'm sure sure but all that this is really serving

1909
01:27:33,632 --> 01:27:34,400
Need to do is

1910
01:27:34,912 --> 01:27:37,216
Kind of teach him how to skirt the

1911
01:27:37,728 --> 01:27:38,752
The rules the right way

1912
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:43,360
Maybe maybe. Maybe maybe not back

1913
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:48,736
Fine and let me know like it needs to be an immediate we will we will end up

1914
01:27:48,992 --> 01:27:49,504
See what happen

1915
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:50,784
Okay I don't know

1916
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:53,344
I don't know what's going to happen but like this point

1917
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:55,648
It's important to remember that on March 12th

1918
01:27:55,904 --> 01:28:00,768
He's just responding to like Media Matters and Mother Jones putting out these articles

1919
01:28:01,024 --> 01:28:02,304
About in silver sale

1920
01:28:02,816 --> 01:28:04,096
He doesn't get that letter

1921
01:28:04,352 --> 01:28:06,656
The letter is dated March 12th

1922
01:28:06,912 --> 01:28:09,472
Okay so he when he's on air it doesn't really good

1923
01:28:09,728 --> 01:28:12,288
Chance he hasn't seen the New York attorney general's letter

1924
01:28:14,592 --> 01:28:17,664
So that is probably not in his awareness until the 3rd

1925
01:28:18,176 --> 01:28:19,712
Okay. This point there is a

1926
01:28:20,224 --> 01:28:25,344
Almost begging that letter to exist as presentation on the show which is

1927
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:26,112
Really interesting

1928
01:28:26,368 --> 01:28:26,880
Sing dynamic

1929
01:28:27,136 --> 01:28:30,464
I think he feels a little bit Untouchable I think he feels a little bit

1930
01:28:31,744 --> 01:28:32,768
I'm on top of the world

1931
01:28:33,024 --> 01:28:33,536
I mean

1932
01:28:33,792 --> 01:28:34,560
Is there

1933
01:28:34,816 --> 01:28:37,120
It's hard to see anybody who is suffering

1934
01:28:37,376 --> 01:28:37,888
Let's count

1935
01:28:38,144 --> 01:28:43,520
Consequences for more terrifying crimes in then you've got out

1936
01:28:44,032 --> 01:28:50,176
There's a sliding scale for presidents and their own experts probably feel like I've been here before

1937
01:28:51,456 --> 01:28:52,736
People talked with me before

1938
01:28:52,992 --> 01:28:54,016
Yep I don't know if

1939
01:28:54,272 --> 01:28:55,296
Feeling stays around

1940
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:59,136
You're doing smile because the other one on the 12th

1941
01:28:59,392 --> 01:28:59,904
Bye-bye

1942
01:29:00,416 --> 01:29:01,696
13th might be different

1943
01:29:02,208 --> 01:29:04,768
So on this clip here Alex

1944
01:29:05,024 --> 01:29:05,536
Is

1945
01:29:05,792 --> 01:29:06,304
Really

1946
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:07,840
What it means it's really important is

1947
01:29:08,096 --> 01:29:10,656
Is when there is a lot of this barrage of

1948
01:29:10,912 --> 01:29:12,192
Outside attacks

1949
01:29:12,448 --> 01:29:12,960
Coming at him

1950
01:29:13,216 --> 01:29:13,728
Call Dakota

1951
01:29:14,496 --> 01:29:15,264
I might call it

1952
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:16,032
Stories

1953
01:29:16,288 --> 01:29:17,312
Better accurate

1954
01:29:17,568 --> 01:29:20,128
He needs to make the audience feel

1955
01:29:20,384 --> 01:29:21,920
Like it's actually about

1956
01:29:22,176 --> 01:29:28,320
Them

1957
01:29:28,576 --> 01:29:34,720
Are they about to do without us on are they don't want you to have a voice they wanted

1958
01:29:34,976 --> 01:29:38,816
Your voice

1959
01:29:39,072 --> 01:29:41,376
So you need to stand together with Alex

1960
01:29:41,632 --> 01:29:45,984
And support his ability to whether this situation because if

1961
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:47,520
If he goes away your voice

1962
01:29:47,776 --> 01:29:49,312
And that's what the

1963
01:29:49,568 --> 01:29:51,104
Really after they're after your voice

1964
01:29:52,128 --> 01:29:52,640
It's not

1965
01:29:52,896 --> 01:29:53,664
Alex

1966
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:54,944
Got a DWI in there

1967
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:56,224
There's consequences for his actions

1968
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:58,016
It's not that he has been

1969
01:29:59,040 --> 01:29:59,808
Immorally

1970
01:30:00,064 --> 01:30:05,440
Fantastically possibly illegally selling or he's a something silver supplement as if it were a drug

1971
01:30:05,952 --> 01:30:06,464
It's not

1972
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:07,232
That is

1973
01:30:07,488 --> 01:30:08,768
It's the globalist hate his audience

1974
01:30:09,024 --> 01:30:12,352
Right now it's very simple it's it's a simple tree of just like

1975
01:30:12,864 --> 01:30:15,424
Any criticism is an attack

1976
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:18,240
Any attack on me is an attack on you

1977
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:21,056
Please shut down any of your ability to think

1978
01:30:21,312 --> 01:30:24,640
Only react emotionally and violently and in defense

1979
01:30:26,176 --> 01:30:28,992
Now we get to the breakdown of the knee

1980
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:31,296
This section takes place here on the

1981
01:30:31,552 --> 01:30:33,600
March 12th episode

1982
01:30:34,112 --> 01:30:37,184
This is where everything becomes more solidified

1983
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:37,952
Alex hits

1984
01:30:38,208 --> 01:30:38,720
The beats

1985
01:30:39,488 --> 01:30:40,256
I don't mean to tell you

1986
01:30:40,512 --> 01:30:41,024
Divisible

1987
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:41,792
No

1988
01:30:42,048 --> 01:30:43,328
No not the

1989
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:44,864
Nitrous oxide

1990
01:30:45,376 --> 01:30:45,888
There's

1991
01:30:46,144 --> 01:30:46,656
This is no life

1992
01:30:46,912 --> 01:30:48,704
Can gas matter

1993
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:51,264
Gives Abby the deformed

1994
01:30:51,776 --> 01:30:52,288
The Final Four

1995
01:30:52,544 --> 01:30:53,312
What I would describe as the

1996
01:30:53,568 --> 01:30:55,872
The Final Four

1997
01:30:56,128 --> 01:30:56,640
This is

1998
01:30:56,896 --> 01:30:57,664
Much more

1999
01:30:58,944 --> 01:30:59,712
Like this

2000
01:30:59,968 --> 01:31:00,736
This is what we're going

2001
01:31:00,992 --> 01:31:02,528
Okay and it's all

2002
01:31:02,784 --> 01:31:03,296
Bulshit

2003
01:31:03,552 --> 01:31:04,832
Break it down piece by piece

2004
01:31:05,344 --> 01:31:05,856
Says it goes along

2005
01:31:06,368 --> 01:31:07,648
Here's what we know

2006
01:31:09,184 --> 01:31:14,048
Chronicle dish with the author of the u.s. biological weapons law

2007
01:31:18,656 --> 01:31:23,008
Nauseam with the actual research papers of India and other major

2008
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:25,824
Prestigious universities around the world

2009
01:31:26,336 --> 01:31:27,872
Coronavirus USA

2010
01:31:28,128 --> 01:31:30,688
Ridiculously man-made virus

2011
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:33,760
Chimera with a bunch of different families of viruses

2012
01:31:34,016 --> 01:31:35,296
Splice together

2013
01:31:36,576 --> 01:31:39,136
With an HIV delivery system

2014
01:31:40,416 --> 01:31:42,208
Welded onto it as well

2015
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:45,280
Not HIV

2016
01:31:46,304 --> 01:31:48,608
The HIV virus delivery system

2017
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:49,632
None of that's true

2018
01:31:49,888 --> 01:31:52,448
Alex has not had great experts on the show he's smoking

2019
01:31:52,704 --> 01:31:53,728
Unhinged lunatics

2020
01:31:53,984 --> 01:31:56,544
Holocaust denier help him build up his narrative

2021
01:31:57,056 --> 01:31:58,848
But none of it even close to real

2022
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:00,640
He constantly mentions that Indians

2023
01:32:00,896 --> 01:32:01,408
Study buddy

2024
01:32:01,664 --> 01:32:02,176
Never really

2025
01:32:02,432 --> 01:32:02,944
Discusses

2026
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:04,224
Is the contents of it at all

2027
01:32:04,736 --> 01:32:06,528
He had waves away the fact that it was retract

2028
01:32:06,784 --> 01:32:08,576
By its own authors after their methods in

2029
01:32:08,832 --> 01:32:10,112
Conclusions

2030
01:32:10,368 --> 01:32:11,648
Play critique by the scientific community

2031
01:32:11,904 --> 01:32:13,184
Purchasing that they came from

2032
01:32:13,696 --> 01:32:15,232
Pressure from the globalist

2033
01:32:15,488 --> 01:32:16,256
Come down Dan

2034
01:32:16,768 --> 01:32:20,864
Truth can't get out also I thought that Alex's narratives about the Hy-Vee delivery

2035
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:22,144
System thing we're just do not

2036
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:23,424
Understanding the furrion verse

2037
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:24,448
Is a stew cleavage

2038
01:32:24,704 --> 01:32:26,496
But I think they might have been giving him too much

2039
01:32:26,752 --> 01:32:27,264
Credit

2040
01:32:29,056 --> 01:32:30,848
Think that's just a bat Indian study

2041
01:32:31,104 --> 01:32:32,896
I think that's all that is and he didn't read it

2042
01:32:33,408 --> 01:32:39,040
In that study the authors found for nucleotide sequences they claimed were not present in other Coronavirus

2043
01:32:39,296 --> 01:32:41,088
Speculated were swapped with zika

2044
01:32:41,344 --> 01:32:42,368
Containers in HIV

2045
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:44,928
One of the main reasons they're paper ended up

2046
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:46,208
Tractor Disney Swift

2047
01:32:46,464 --> 01:32:47,232
Criticism they got

2048
01:32:47,488 --> 01:32:49,024
Particularly relating to

2049
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:49,792
To the fact that

2050
01:32:50,048 --> 01:32:53,376
Two of those sequences are found in other coronavirus is

2051
01:32:53,632 --> 01:32:55,936
And only one of the sequences was even simpler to

2052
01:32:56,192 --> 01:32:58,240
1 Fountain HIV there's almost certainly

2053
01:32:58,496 --> 01:32:59,008
Coincidence

2054
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:00,800
This is most likely all out

2055
01:33:01,056 --> 01:33:02,848
Just talkin about any claims there's an HIV deliver

2056
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:03,872
It's all

2057
01:33:04,128 --> 01:33:05,152
Just Trace back to that

2058
01:33:05,408 --> 01:33:05,920
Retracted

2059
01:33:06,432 --> 01:33:07,456
Discredit

2060
01:33:07,968 --> 01:33:08,736
Indian study

2061
01:33:09,248 --> 01:33:14,880
None of this is real at all it's just a shotty collection of b******* that he's talked about for the last two months being pressed together

2062
01:33:15,136 --> 01:33:15,648
To make more

2063
01:33:15,904 --> 01:33:16,416
Impactful

2064
01:33:16,928 --> 01:33:17,696
In many ways

2065
01:33:17,952 --> 01:33:18,720
It is written

2066
01:33:18,976 --> 01:33:19,488
Diculous Lemay

2067
01:33:20,256 --> 01:33:21,792
Only the adverb just means that it's

2068
01:33:22,816 --> 01:33:23,584
I don't yet

2069
01:33:25,632 --> 01:33:28,960
So we get to the second piece of the narrative and it has to do with

2070
01:33:29,472 --> 01:33:30,240
Xenophobia

2071
01:33:31,008 --> 01:33:32,544
The day 16 weeks ago

2072
01:33:33,824 --> 01:33:39,968
Is China but when Trump talk about stopping flights and we said yeah that's great idea they went oh my God it's so

2073
01:33:40,224 --> 01:33:40,736
Susanna Baumann

2074
01:33:41,504 --> 01:33:42,272
Lenawee glider

2075
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:44,320
South Korea Japan

2076
01:33:45,344 --> 01:33:47,392
Tasha all the other stoplight

2077
01:33:47,904 --> 01:33:50,464
When they freak out

2078
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:52,256
Comedian said it was.

2079
01:33:53,024 --> 01:33:54,304
So did China something you in

2080
01:33:55,584 --> 01:33:58,400
Even responded shooting people checkpoint with good

2081
01:33:58,912 --> 01:34:01,472
Everybody else had

2082
01:34:02,752 --> 01:34:04,288
And that's when you see the agenda

2083
01:34:04,544 --> 01:34:06,336
So there's no good evidence that

2084
01:34:06,592 --> 01:34:07,872
Suggest that any country that

2085
01:34:08,128 --> 01:34:09,152
Suspended flights to Cenote

2086
01:34:09,408 --> 01:34:10,944
Decreased incidence of Coronavirus

2087
01:34:11,456 --> 01:34:14,272
Princeton's Alex list South Korea who stopped all flights

2088
01:34:14,528 --> 01:34:16,320
Today Google city with the most infections

2089
01:34:16,576 --> 01:34:17,856
Is on February 23rd

2090
01:34:18,368 --> 01:34:20,416
That country I had 700

2091
01:34:20,672 --> 01:34:21,440
63 cases

2092
01:34:21,696 --> 01:34:23,488
At that point and by March 1st they had

2093
01:34:23,744 --> 01:34:25,024
3736

2094
01:34:26,048 --> 01:34:29,120
What are the reasons that generally people if you shutting down travel from

2095
01:34:29,376 --> 01:34:29,888
Specifically

2096
01:34:30,144 --> 01:34:30,912
Xenophobic

2097
01:34:31,168 --> 01:34:34,240
Is because it really doesn't have the effect that you would think it would have in terms

2098
01:34:34,496 --> 01:34:35,264
The disease containment

2099
01:34:35,776 --> 01:34:39,360
Experts on the subject agree that it's best to allow people to travel that way you can

2100
01:34:39,616 --> 01:34:40,640
Set up screening point

2101
01:34:40,896 --> 01:34:41,408
So people come

2102
01:34:41,664 --> 01:34:42,176
Coming in and out

2103
01:34:42,432 --> 01:34:43,200
Would you wouldn't be able to

2104
01:34:43,456 --> 01:34:45,760
To do with everything was shut down and only people

2105
01:34:46,016 --> 01:34:47,296
The only people who come

2106
01:34:47,552 --> 01:34:48,064
Again

2107
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:49,344
Complete unknown quad

2108
01:34:50,368 --> 01:34:51,904
Given the lack of evidence of ism

2109
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:52,928
Ineffective strategy

2110
01:34:53,184 --> 01:34:55,744
If someone is pushing for it to be used at usually means at Birth

2111
01:34:57,536 --> 01:34:58,560
Or they have a hidden agenda

2112
01:34:59,328 --> 01:35:00,352
Given how frequently the trumpet

2113
01:35:00,608 --> 01:35:01,376
Administration strike

2114
01:35:01,888 --> 01:35:02,912
Travel for bigoted reasons

2115
01:35:03,168 --> 01:35:03,936
The past

2116
01:35:04,192 --> 01:35:05,216
Kind of understand

2117
01:35:05,472 --> 01:35:05,984
Some commentators

2118
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:06,752
Like it that

2119
01:35:08,288 --> 01:35:12,384
Alex is still not demonstrated his claims of people being shot at checkpoints but even the best

2120
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:14,432
But he's acting as if it is

2121
01:35:14,688 --> 01:35:15,968
Employment with the UN

2122
01:35:16,224 --> 01:35:16,992
None of which is based

2123
01:35:17,248 --> 01:35:17,760
In reality

2124
01:35:18,016 --> 01:35:18,528
This is all just

2125
01:35:18,784 --> 01:35:19,296
Just b*******

2126
01:35:20,064 --> 01:35:20,832
So now we get to

2127
01:35:21,088 --> 01:35:21,600
53rd

2128
01:35:21,856 --> 01:35:24,160
Section of the gift

2129
01:35:24,672 --> 01:35:26,464
I was just thinking that the

2130
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:27,488
Think about the

2131
01:35:27,744 --> 01:35:28,512
Travel ban

2132
01:35:29,792 --> 01:35:30,816
Story coming out of Italy

2133
01:35:31,072 --> 01:35:31,584
Philly where they

2134
01:35:32,096 --> 01:35:32,864
Somebody leaked it

2135
01:35:33,376 --> 01:35:34,912
That they were going to shut down

2136
01:35:35,936 --> 01:35:37,728
They were going to create a quarantine Zone

2137
01:35:37,984 --> 01:35:40,288
And they licked it about 24 hours before

2138
01:35:40,544 --> 01:35:41,056
And people

2139
01:35:41,312 --> 01:35:43,104
Ran away from the

2140
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:45,152
Quarantine Zone that's certainly a risk

2141
01:35:48,224 --> 01:35:48,736
More people

2142
01:35:48,992 --> 01:35:50,528
You didn't wind up helping anybody

2143
01:35:50,784 --> 01:35:54,880
Can't ever really fully lockdown things even if there isn't

2144
01:35:55,136 --> 01:35:56,416
Leaks like that

2145
01:35:56,672 --> 01:35:57,696
Describing like that you can't

2146
01:35:58,208 --> 01:35:58,976
You can't have

2147
01:35:59,488 --> 01:36:01,024
Like a waterproof

2148
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:02,560
Let's say our air proof

2149
01:36:04,352 --> 01:36:07,424
Something and so you'll inevitably end up

2150
01:36:08,192 --> 01:36:09,728
You can you can when you do things

2151
01:36:09,984 --> 01:36:11,776
Things like shutdown travel

2152
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:14,080
Can slow things down

2153
01:36:14,592 --> 01:36:15,360
As we've discussed

2154
01:36:15,616 --> 01:36:17,664
In the past they can't slow spreads down

2155
01:36:18,176 --> 01:36:19,456
But it won't have the

2156
01:36:19,712 --> 01:36:20,224
The desired effect

2157
01:36:21,504 --> 01:36:22,272
Seem to be

2158
01:36:22,784 --> 01:36:24,576
The motivations and Alex

2159
01:36:24,832 --> 01:36:25,344
Or Trump

2160
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:26,368
Would suggest oh yeah

2161
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:27,904
Navigate to this third child

2162
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:29,184
Secure and

2163
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:30,208
More

2164
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:32,512
Man-made virus so they can release him

2165
01:36:33,024 --> 01:36:35,328
In the lab they know

2166
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:37,376
Human prisoners

2167
01:36:37,632 --> 01:36:39,168
They know how it's going to be

2168
01:36:39,424 --> 01:36:40,192
Replicate

2169
01:36:41,216 --> 01:36:43,264
Just Waxing pigs

2170
01:36:43,776 --> 01:36:44,288
Bass

2171
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:45,824
It also can get it

2172
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:47,616
There's no evidence of this is man-made

2173
01:36:47,872 --> 01:36:49,664
That anyone was doing any

2174
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:52,480
Any testing on it but if they work this still makes no sense

2175
01:36:52,992 --> 01:36:57,856
No amount of testing would be able to predict what coding errors the virus of making RNA replication

2176
01:36:58,368 --> 01:36:59,136
Should lead to the mutation

2177
01:36:59,648 --> 01:37:02,464
That's random it's just a natural process that scientist

2178
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:04,000
Could not control North Verde

2179
01:37:04,512 --> 01:37:05,792
With any kind of accuracy

2180
01:37:06,304 --> 01:37:07,328
Also there's no evidence

2181
01:37:07,584 --> 01:37:08,096
The pigs can get

2182
01:37:08,352 --> 01:37:09,120
Does Coronavirus

2183
01:37:09,632 --> 01:37:15,008
There are people born coronavirus is for sure like porcine respiratory Coronavirus

2184
01:37:15,264 --> 01:37:17,056
But there is currently no indication that

2185
01:37:17,312 --> 01:37:17,824
The current outbreak

2186
01:37:18,336 --> 01:37:18,848
Pigs

2187
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:20,128
Dr. Jeff

2188
01:37:20,640 --> 01:37:21,664
Cindy manager of the

2189
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:23,456
Canada West swine Health intelligence

2190
01:37:23,712 --> 01:37:24,736
It's not work said quote

2191
01:37:24,992 --> 01:37:27,552
There is very there is no very clear evidence

2192
01:37:27,808 --> 01:37:29,088
The pigs might be susceptible to

2193
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:30,368
Specific strain

2194
01:37:30,624 --> 01:37:31,904
But I want to caution

2195
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:33,184
Not that there is much

2196
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:35,232
Research going on right now

2197
01:37:35,488 --> 01:37:36,768
That this could change within a week or two

2198
01:37:37,536 --> 01:37:39,328
Alex is making up this affect pigs

2199
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:41,120
And it is that

2200
01:37:41,376 --> 01:37:42,912
Even if we eventually learned

2201
01:37:43,168 --> 01:37:43,936
The pigs are sup

2202
01:37:44,448 --> 01:37:44,960
Please just make

2203
01:37:45,216 --> 01:37:45,728
Take me to shut up

2204
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:46,752
He has no idea

2205
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:48,800
So we get to another line

2206
01:37:49,056 --> 01:37:51,616
Of this this is more or less just

2207
01:37:51,872 --> 01:37:52,640
Segmented chunk

2208
01:37:52,896 --> 01:37:54,688
Books of like a 3-minute disc

2209
01:37:54,944 --> 01:37:56,992
Installation of America

2210
01:37:57,248 --> 01:37:58,784
Yeah this is

2211
01:37:59,552 --> 01:38:00,576
And you watch

2212
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:03,136
Play Disconnected

2213
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:04,672
It's clear

2214
01:38:05,952 --> 01:38:06,720
They're already

2215
01:38:07,232 --> 01:38:10,048
For now 10 different strings

2216
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:16,704
Some stranger more deadly than others there are 10 strains and exaggerating the

2217
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:20,032
In that research that we discussed earlier that there are two S&L stay

2218
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:22,336
Which isn't even something there's a consensus

2219
01:38:22,592 --> 01:38:23,360
It's about he's just

2220
01:38:23,616 --> 01:38:24,128
Embellishing

2221
01:38:24,384 --> 01:38:24,896
Exaggerating

2222
01:38:25,664 --> 01:38:27,456
Navigate to the next Beeson that's

2223
01:38:27,712 --> 01:38:28,224
The chimera

2224
01:38:29,248 --> 01:38:32,320
Show that he's got a whole family

2225
01:38:32,576 --> 01:38:33,344
A family

2226
01:38:37,696 --> 01:38:38,720
Where it came from

2227
01:38:39,232 --> 01:38:40,512
A family of families

2228
01:38:40,768 --> 01:38:41,792
Spider-Man

2229
01:38:42,048 --> 01:38:43,072
This is a

2230
01:38:43,328 --> 01:38:44,352
This is the Italian virus

2231
01:38:44,864 --> 01:38:51,008
So is that what we're calling it and we got a big family we got the virus

2232
01:38:53,312 --> 01:38:56,384
Free imprecise language

2233
01:38:56,640 --> 01:38:59,712
Describe the the situation I don't know

2234
01:39:00,224 --> 01:39:04,064
It's pretty bad like this is really truly trying to get

2235
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:07,392
The concrete version that would make it even worse

2236
01:39:07,648 --> 01:39:12,512
Like fishes are the results of our extended investigation into this

2237
01:39:13,024 --> 01:39:13,792
And all of it

2238
01:39:14,304 --> 01:39:14,816
Just nonsense

2239
01:39:15,328 --> 01:39:16,352
I I just

2240
01:39:16,608 --> 01:39:17,632
I have a hard time

2241
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:21,472
With this like it cuz it's still difficult to

2242
01:39:21,728 --> 01:39:22,752
Truly comprehend this

2243
01:39:23,008 --> 01:39:24,288
Scale of what's going on

2244
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:25,824
Right like nobody

2245
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:26,592
Has any

2246
01:39:26,848 --> 01:39:27,360
Clue

2247
01:39:27,872 --> 01:39:28,640
How big this

2248
01:39:28,896 --> 01:39:29,408
Micah

2249
01:39:29,664 --> 01:39:30,432
Sure and

2250
01:39:30,688 --> 01:39:31,456
For him to just

2251
01:39:31,712 --> 01:39:33,760
All the sudden start throwing this s*** around

2252
01:39:34,272 --> 01:39:34,784
This

2253
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:36,064
At this level it's

2254
01:39:37,088 --> 01:39:37,600
II

2255
01:39:37,856 --> 01:39:38,368
I cannot

2256
01:39:38,624 --> 01:39:39,392
F****** handle that

2257
01:39:39,648 --> 01:39:40,416
Yeah it like this is

2258
01:39:40,928 --> 01:39:41,952
Genuinely terrifying

2259
01:39:42,976 --> 01:39:44,512
Pretty gross Behavior

2260
01:39:46,048 --> 01:39:48,096
Just because we're all trying to figure out what

2261
01:39:48,352 --> 01:39:48,864
The tone

2262
01:39:50,912 --> 01:39:52,448
Yeah we talked about that

2263
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:57,824
It's even very difficult for me as someone who's covering this stuff cuz I will have Quiet Moments

2264
01:39:58,080 --> 01:39:59,360
Surreal self-doubt

2265
01:39:59,872 --> 01:40:01,408
I have made too little of

2266
01:40:01,664 --> 01:40:02,688
Of course of the situation

2267
01:40:04,224 --> 01:40:05,248
It's really tough because

2268
01:40:05,504 --> 01:40:06,528
Recovering Alex

2269
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:08,832
Alex Wright says bulshit

2270
01:40:09,088 --> 01:40:11,392
Yeah we say this is bulshit yeah

2271
01:40:13,696 --> 01:40:14,720
Your heart I don't know the tone

2272
01:40:14,976 --> 01:40:16,256
I'm not an expert in

2273
01:40:16,768 --> 01:40:17,280
Yeah and

2274
01:40:17,536 --> 01:40:18,304
It's there's no way

2275
01:40:18,816 --> 01:40:20,864
There's no way yet to really kind of

2276
01:40:21,376 --> 01:40:23,168
Walk that fine line between

2277
01:40:23,936 --> 01:40:24,448
Worrying

2278
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:25,728
Concern

2279
01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:26,752
And

2280
01:40:27,008 --> 01:40:27,520
Panic

2281
01:40:28,032 --> 01:40:30,336
Like there should absolutely be worried there's

2282
01:40:30,592 --> 01:40:31,104
Should be concealed

2283
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:32,384
And there should be caution

2284
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:34,688
There should be risk aversion

2285
01:40:34,944 --> 01:40:36,736
Pushing things into that full-on panic

2286
01:40:38,272 --> 01:40:39,296
You know

2287
01:40:39,552 --> 01:40:40,576
That's such a

2288
01:40:40,832 --> 01:40:41,344
Dumb things

2289
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:42,112
To do

2290
01:40:44,928 --> 01:40:45,440
Toast

2291
01:40:45,696 --> 01:40:46,464
So hate

2292
01:40:46,976 --> 01:40:48,256
Well let's get back to this

2293
01:40:48,512 --> 01:40:50,816
This concreting of the the narrative

2294
01:40:51,072 --> 01:40:52,096
It would not be completely

2295
01:40:52,352 --> 01:40:53,632
If it didn't include

2296
01:40:54,144 --> 01:40:59,776
The idea that Obama song 2015

2297
01:41:00,032 --> 01:41:04,384
North Carolina University at Obama allowed to transfer

2298
01:41:04,896 --> 01:41:05,408
That's not true

2299
01:41:05,664 --> 01:41:08,224
I hope it's just that misrepresenting an article he didn't read

2300
01:41:08,736 --> 01:41:14,624
So you get back to North Carolina UNC Chapel Hill article that he's lying about

2301
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:15,648
And that's where this

2302
01:41:15,904 --> 01:41:16,416
Began

2303
01:41:16,672 --> 01:41:19,744
You have the original virus Boston 2015

2304
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:23,584
North Carolina University did Obama allow the transfer of it was a big National

2305
01:41:24,864 --> 01:41:28,192
They were able to get a functioning chimera

2306
01:41:29,984 --> 01:41:31,520
They could then be modified further

2307
01:41:34,592 --> 01:41:35,872
Now we know what's happening

2308
01:41:36,384 --> 01:41:37,664
So that's what's happening

2309
01:41:38,176 --> 01:41:43,808
Now we know what's happening I got this Chimera terrible to make a chimera right now

2310
01:41:44,064 --> 01:41:44,576
Please discuss

2311
01:41:44,832 --> 01:41:47,136
Any of that

2312
01:41:47,392 --> 01:41:47,904
Right

2313
01:41:48,160 --> 01:41:51,488
Watch Fullmetal Alchemist now we have pretty much the concrete version

2314
01:41:51,744 --> 01:41:52,256
Narrative

2315
01:41:52,512 --> 01:41:53,792
A Alex's have tons of

2316
01:41:54,048 --> 01:41:57,376
Very very legitimate expert to come in and we've decided that

2317
01:41:57,632 --> 01:41:58,144
This is a bunch of different

2318
01:41:58,400 --> 01:42:03,008
Viruses in one sure you know that the global is there behind it because they say it's xenophobic for

2319
01:42:03,264 --> 01:42:05,568
Trump to shut down travel wow

2320
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:07,616
Praising China or something

2321
01:42:07,872 --> 01:42:12,736
Man-made they've tested it to they know the mutations that are going to happen there's 10 strains

2322
01:42:13,248 --> 01:42:16,832
It's a family of families family family

2323
01:42:17,088 --> 01:42:17,856
The blame because he sold it

2324
01:42:18,112 --> 01:42:20,160
The China 2015 is created in

2325
01:42:20,416 --> 01:42:21,952
This lab at UNC Chapel Hill

2326
01:42:22,208 --> 01:42:24,768
Extraneous stuff Beyond this is up for

2327
01:42:25,536 --> 01:42:30,400
It's not as important this is the narrative that Alex needs to get out or else he's screwed

2328
01:42:30,912 --> 01:42:32,448
That's why he's boiling it down like

2329
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:35,008
There's so many parallels

2330
01:42:35,264 --> 01:42:35,776
To the way they

2331
01:42:36,544 --> 01:42:37,312
Treating this

2332
01:42:37,568 --> 01:42:38,080
From a person

2333
01:42:38,336 --> 01:42:38,848
Effective

2334
01:42:39,104 --> 01:42:41,152
Nothing anybody does nothing

2335
01:42:41,408 --> 01:42:42,944
Anything nothing is Trump Spa

2336
01:42:43,456 --> 01:42:45,248
Nothing he does is Trump's fault

2337
01:42:45,504 --> 01:42:46,016
With

2338
01:42:46,272 --> 01:42:48,064
Nothing I did to get the DWI is my

2339
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:51,392
Nothing is a nobody

2340
01:42:51,648 --> 01:42:54,464
Look you're going to you can blame everybody but me

2341
01:42:54,720 --> 01:42:56,256
And you can blame everybody but him

2342
01:42:56,768 --> 01:42:58,304
Everybody else's fault it turns out

2343
01:42:58,560 --> 01:42:59,840
We're the best at everything all the

2344
01:43:01,632 --> 01:43:02,656
So now we got this

2345
01:43:02,912 --> 01:43:03,424
Down

2346
01:43:03,680 --> 01:43:04,448
We can take a look

2347
01:43:05,728 --> 01:43:07,264
What is this used

2348
01:43:07,776 --> 01:43:08,800
And here's Alex's Bazaar

2349
01:43:09,568 --> 01:43:11,616
They're using it to paralyze the economy

2350
01:43:12,896 --> 01:43:14,176
Hysteria like fear

2351
01:43:15,712 --> 01:43:21,856
This is the globalist plan to teach us to live under lockdown to teach us if there's this invisible in an even worse than terrorists

2352
01:43:22,112 --> 01:43:25,696
Give my rights up and take the person ovulation to do what they say

2353
01:43:25,952 --> 01:43:27,232
So after that laundry list

2354
01:43:27,488 --> 01:43:29,792
Completely fictional elements of the finalized version

2355
01:43:30,048 --> 01:43:30,816
This narrative Alex

2356
01:43:31,072 --> 01:43:35,168
Research that is being used to paralyze the economy and make us live under lockdown

2357
01:43:35,424 --> 01:43:35,936
Exactly

2358
01:43:36,192 --> 01:43:37,216
And that's why we should shut

2359
01:43:37,472 --> 01:43:41,056
Down Sacramento's borders send the military in

2360
01:43:41,312 --> 01:43:45,408
Close it off arrest everybody hang people little disjointed

2361
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:50,016
My first suggestion is it if you see someone go 047 and their premises

2362
01:43:50,272 --> 01:43:51,040
Their conclusion is

2363
01:43:51,296 --> 01:43:52,320
Probably ship to

2364
01:43:52,832 --> 01:43:58,976
What Alex is doing is taking the natural consequences of something and then pretending those consequences are why the thing happened to begin with

2365
01:44:00,512 --> 01:44:03,840
Naturally A large-scale outbreak is going to have an effect on the economy

2366
01:44:04,352 --> 01:44:05,888
It's pretty inescapable in the modern world

2367
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:08,192
Whether Market disruptions that happened

2368
01:44:08,448 --> 01:44:09,216
After an outbreak

2369
01:44:09,472 --> 01:44:13,056
You have in no way proving that the virus was released in order to

2370
01:44:13,312 --> 01:44:14,080
Precipitate

2371
01:44:14,336 --> 01:44:14,848
Disruption

2372
01:44:15,104 --> 01:44:18,176
You've got a good start on that Thriller novel you've always been meaning to write

2373
01:44:19,712 --> 01:44:20,736
And that's what Alex is doing

2374
01:44:21,248 --> 01:44:23,296
You taking a natural consequence and then

2375
01:44:23,808 --> 01:44:25,344
Claiming it's the motivation

2376
01:44:26,112 --> 01:44:30,976
The same goes for things like shutting down of the NBA and events with large attendance as you know that

2377
01:44:31,232 --> 01:44:32,000
That's a natural calm

2378
01:44:33,024 --> 01:44:33,536
That's the correct

2379
01:44:34,048 --> 01:44:36,096
To do when there's a concern about no brakes

2380
01:44:36,864 --> 01:44:37,888
If you pretend that

2381
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:39,680
What is the motivation you can

2382
01:44:39,936 --> 01:44:41,984
Completely distort reality without ever having to

2383
01:44:42,240 --> 01:44:42,752
Promises

2384
01:44:43,264 --> 01:44:47,104
They wanted to shut down all this stuff in order to cause hysteria night that's why they were

2385
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:47,872
It's it's

2386
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:50,688
And everybody knows the real see

2387
01:44:50,944 --> 01:44:51,968
Situation here is that the

2388
01:44:52,224 --> 01:44:58,368
The Golden State Warriors release this virus in order to make sure that Steph Curry and Klay Thompson can get fully healthy for the end of the year

2389
01:44:58,624 --> 01:44:59,136
NBA season

2390
01:44:59,392 --> 01:45:02,976
They're going to sneak into the 8th seed in the west and they're going to wind up winning the whole thing

2391
01:45:03,232 --> 01:45:08,864
This is all Steph Curry plant been proven

2392
01:45:09,120 --> 01:45:09,888
This strategy

2393
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:10,912
Pretending

2394
01:45:11,168 --> 01:45:14,496
Consequences are actually secret motivations

2395
01:45:14,752 --> 01:45:15,520
Conspiracy worldview

2396
01:45:16,288 --> 01:45:18,848
Generally what he does is yell about secret motivation

2397
01:45:19,104 --> 01:45:20,896
For consequences he's making up

2398
01:45:21,152 --> 01:45:24,224
Like in the case of him yelling about the globalist staging mass shootings

2399
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:25,504
Pretty secret motivation

2400
01:45:26,016 --> 01:45:26,528
Is gone

2401
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:28,320
The imagined consequence

2402
01:45:28,576 --> 01:45:29,344
I'm losing his gun

2403
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:30,112
Never Comes

2404
01:45:30,624 --> 01:45:34,464
But expanded gun regulations and restrictions are the natural consequence you would have

2405
01:45:34,976 --> 01:45:36,256
Like to see from Tonto shootings

2406
01:45:36,768 --> 01:45:37,536
You imagined

2407
01:45:37,792 --> 01:45:38,304
The consequence

2408
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:40,352
The result of the shooting

2409
01:45:40,608 --> 01:45:41,120
1/10

2410
01:45:41,376 --> 01:45:42,656
That go

2411
01:45:42,912 --> 01:45:45,472
Is what motivated the staging of the shootings

2412
01:45:45,728 --> 01:45:46,240
To begin with

2413
01:45:47,008 --> 01:45:48,800
The current situation is just kind of the envy

2414
01:45:49,568 --> 01:45:51,360
There are real-world consequences happen

2415
01:45:51,616 --> 01:45:52,128
From this virus

2416
01:45:52,384 --> 01:45:54,176
So Alex is just taking what's happening

2417
01:45:54,432 --> 01:45:54,944
The real world

2418
01:45:55,200 --> 01:45:56,480
I'm pretending it's what the globalist

2419
01:45:56,736 --> 01:45:58,272
We're trying to do by releasing this

2420
01:45:58,784 --> 01:46:02,368
Maybe race specific bioweapon which it's not and

2421
01:46:03,136 --> 01:46:04,672
So that's the game is being played

2422
01:46:04,928 --> 01:46:06,464
But it's the inverse situation

2423
01:46:08,256 --> 01:46:10,560
Yes when the consoles are all good

2424
01:46:10,816 --> 01:46:11,840
Right right but I mean when

2425
01:46:12,096 --> 01:46:14,656
The consequences are real and you're making up the motivation that's

2426
01:46:14,912 --> 01:46:16,192
Scapegoating and that's what her

2427
01:46:16,704 --> 01:46:19,776
Well yeah when the consequences aren't real that you haven't

2428
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:26,432
But that's still good

2429
01:46:28,224 --> 01:46:30,784
I can't imagine Alex's underwear

2430
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:31,552
Insane not today

2431
01:46:31,808 --> 01:46:33,856
So he starts talking about how like

2432
01:46:34,624 --> 01:46:35,136
Cuban talk

2433
01:46:35,648 --> 01:46:36,160
How they're going to do this

2434
01:46:37,184 --> 01:46:40,000
They're going to release his bioweapon started to bring it a world government

2435
01:46:40,256 --> 01:46:42,048
Can you pull back from this clear

2436
01:46:44,864 --> 01:46:49,472
This is the year 2020 and the UN and the Bilderberg Group of the day was probably said

2437
01:46:49,728 --> 01:46:50,752
We will use

2438
01:46:51,008 --> 01:46:52,032
Bayou

2439
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:53,568
Happen

2440
01:46:54,336 --> 01:46:57,920
Events and pledged to bring in World ottoman that control

2441
01:46:58,432 --> 01:47:00,480
That's how you make country coordinate with each other

2442
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:06,880
Taylors

2443
01:47:07,392 --> 01:47:08,928
While they take control of your life

2444
01:47:09,184 --> 01:47:10,720
You know what I realized when I heard that clip

2445
01:47:10,976 --> 01:47:12,256
Was that realize that I haven't heard

2446
01:47:12,768 --> 01:47:15,840
Complain about Bilderberg in a long time

2447
01:47:16,096 --> 01:47:22,240
Forgotten them is being the big bad guys in the world but LOL

2448
01:47:22,496 --> 01:47:26,080
Alex is in no way proven the Davos or the UN or Bilderberg

2449
01:47:26,336 --> 01:47:27,360
Has ever said any of these things

2450
01:47:27,872 --> 01:47:30,176
Is no citation you just sort of asserts this s***

2451
01:47:30,432 --> 01:47:32,992
He's built up his people as the arch villains on his show

2452
01:47:33,248 --> 01:47:34,272
Is Oriental just Prime 20

2453
01:47:34,528 --> 01:47:35,040
Unquestionably

2454
01:47:35,296 --> 01:47:35,808
Amcrest

2455
01:47:36,064 --> 01:47:37,088
Only accept

2456
01:47:37,856 --> 01:47:39,136
Yeah I've been following out

2457
01:47:39,392 --> 01:47:42,208
Pretty closely for years now including closely scrutinizing

2458
01:47:42,464 --> 01:47:44,768
Documentaries endgame and The Obama Deception

2459
01:47:45,024 --> 01:47:47,840
And I've no reason to believe he could actually prove anything you saying

2460
01:47:48,096 --> 01:47:48,608
Nightclub

2461
01:47:49,120 --> 01:47:52,448
Just be sure I went back and I reviewed Alex's bibliography for endgame

2462
01:47:52,704 --> 01:47:55,520
AMC 3rd something in there that

2463
01:47:55,776 --> 01:47:56,288
I did

2464
01:47:56,544 --> 01:48:01,664
I found a lot of Encarta Pages Planet articles but I didn't find any evidence of the globalist

2465
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:02,944
They're trying to use bio-weapon

2466
01:48:03,200 --> 01:48:05,248
Are goals of a world government

2467
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:06,784
Do you know what's fun

2468
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:10,112
He presupposes that should there have been a world government

2469
01:48:10,368 --> 01:48:11,392
Or should there be a world governed

2470
01:48:11,904 --> 01:48:12,928
It would get us out of

2471
01:48:14,720 --> 01:48:18,048
Because he's saying that they will be our saviour's at our jailers but

2472
01:48:18,816 --> 01:48:20,864
Still saying because they

2473
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:25,216
Created the problem would say almost evolution

2474
01:48:25,728 --> 01:48:27,008
Alex

2475
01:48:27,264 --> 01:48:27,776
Got to give it up

2476
01:48:28,032 --> 01:48:28,544
Alex

2477
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:31,360
It's chugging a little bit about this idea that it's a bunch of viruses

2478
01:48:31,616 --> 01:48:33,408
Does put into want all splice together

2479
01:48:33,664 --> 01:48:35,712
I want you to pay close attention to this because

2480
01:48:35,968 --> 01:48:36,736
Listen to how

2481
01:48:36,992 --> 01:48:38,272
Incapable it he is a

2482
01:48:38,528 --> 01:48:39,552
Even discussing this

2483
01:48:39,808 --> 01:48:40,576
It's on any level

2484
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:42,112
Headlines

2485
01:48:42,368 --> 01:48:46,720
Let It Go they were times all the conspiracy theorists in Russia and China

2486
01:48:47,488 --> 01:48:49,280
Brazil and Mexico

2487
01:48:49,536 --> 01:48:53,376
They are all saying it's man-made and then there's

2488
01:48:54,144 --> 01:48:56,448
Under electron microscope and you can see

2489
01:49:04,128 --> 01:49:06,432
Wow

2490
01:49:06,688 --> 01:49:08,992
A blob together

2491
01:49:14,624 --> 01:49:15,392
Sing

2492
01:49:15,648 --> 01:49:18,208
It was in miniaturize so we can be airborne

2493
01:49:18,464 --> 01:49:21,536
Your lungs every part of it made

2494
01:49:21,792 --> 01:49:23,328
But it was spread

2495
01:49:24,096 --> 01:49:26,912
So that everybody would end up learning they been infected weather

2496
01:49:27,680 --> 01:49:29,984
To the hysteria Lori's Fever Pitch

2497
01:49:30,240 --> 01:49:32,800
Once the test gets get out and that's why Trump says

2498
01:49:33,056 --> 01:49:35,104
Problem no big deal

2499
01:49:39,200 --> 01:49:40,224
Because the White House knows

2500
01:49:40,736 --> 01:49:46,112
So what thing I think is very important to recognize that may often just go to fade into the background is how unable Alex's

2501
01:49:46,368 --> 01:49:47,136
To talk about these issues

2502
01:49:47,904 --> 01:49:50,464
You can hear it so clearly hear he's a fumbling for words

2503
01:49:50,720 --> 01:49:55,072
Because he doesn't really even understand his own conspiracy narratives on any level deeper than some headlines

2504
01:49:56,608 --> 01:49:57,376
See the pieces of pizza

2505
01:49:57,632 --> 01:49:58,656
Damn right that's

2506
01:49:58,912 --> 01:49:59,424
Science

2507
01:49:59,680 --> 01:50:02,752
Right what's at the root of this whole misunderstanding Alex says about things

2508
01:50:03,008 --> 01:50:05,824
Splice together text back to that retracted Indian study

2509
01:50:06,336 --> 01:50:08,128
You're not study the authors discussed quote

2510
01:50:08,384 --> 01:50:08,896
Inserts

2511
01:50:09,152 --> 01:50:13,248
In the RNA of the virus which Alex is taken to mean that things were inserted in there

2512
01:50:13,504 --> 01:50:17,344
A berries with imagine designed as finding splice point and all that s***

2513
01:50:17,856 --> 01:50:20,160
In reality when discussing the RNA insert

2514
01:50:20,416 --> 01:50:20,928
Me with Alex

2515
01:50:22,208 --> 01:50:23,232
When already replicates

2516
01:50:23,488 --> 01:50:29,376
It can sometimes add or delete nucleotide sequences and what a sequence is added that wasn't there before it's called in

2517
01:50:29,632 --> 01:50:30,144
Insertion

2518
01:50:30,400 --> 01:50:31,424
It doesn't mean that human

2519
01:50:31,680 --> 01:50:32,192
Concerted anything

2520
01:50:32,448 --> 01:50:34,240
It's just a term that people used to do

2521
01:50:34,496 --> 01:50:35,264
Describe this natural

2522
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:41,664
Phenomena you can see that use the sailor's knot to tie the RNA Dan there's only one possible explanation

2523
01:50:41,920 --> 01:50:43,200
God bless you sailor's knot

2524
01:50:43,456 --> 01:50:43,968
Chirp

2525
01:50:44,224 --> 01:50:50,368
I know that he's just making s*** up but if he's not I would like to challenge Alex to explain the quote slapping viruses together methodology

2526
01:50:50,624 --> 01:50:54,464
And after that I would ask him to walk us through the miniaturization process

2527
01:50:54,720 --> 01:51:00,864
Swirled around and then you get done you know you go inside a body and it's like

2528
01:51:01,120 --> 01:51:04,448
You got to take out a tumor you're not you're not

2529
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:05,728
Baby my baby

2530
01:51:05,984 --> 01:51:10,080
Also apparently Trump is back into being involved in the cover-up

2531
01:51:11,104 --> 01:51:17,248
But he's involved might be one of the things he looks Shady in hindsight about this area that Alex

2532
01:51:17,504 --> 01:51:19,040
Number for

2533
01:51:19,808 --> 01:51:20,832
Whatever

2534
01:51:21,088 --> 01:51:22,368
So Alex is another gas

2535
01:51:23,648 --> 01:51:25,184
He's a man who likes to go to the woods

2536
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:30,560
Tell others to do so as well no communist royalty Joel skousen

2537
01:51:31,328 --> 01:51:32,608
And he starts off his appearance

2538
01:51:32,864 --> 01:51:34,144
5 Maybe

2539
01:51:34,656 --> 01:51:38,752
Unethical selling Alex's home

2540
01:51:39,264 --> 01:51:44,128
You shouldn't be eating any junk food you got to be eating a lot of natural and organic food

2541
01:51:44,896 --> 01:51:51,040
And then you've got to be using some of the really good herbal and

2542
01:51:51,296 --> 01:51:53,088
Salesforce a nano silver

2543
01:51:53,856 --> 01:51:55,392
Very good

2544
01:51:55,904 --> 01:52:00,256
I'm getting all these types of Coronavirus

2545
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:07,424
Medical studies

2546
01:52:07,680 --> 01:52:09,728
Sirius anecdotal evidence

2547
01:52:09,984 --> 01:52:13,568
You're going to f*** around and get a letter from the New York attorney general

2548
01:52:15,104 --> 01:52:21,248
I got some serious anecdotal studies on this don't get involved in this when you don't have feelings

2549
01:52:21,504 --> 01:52:23,040
Wait in there we need another

2550
01:52:23,296 --> 01:52:26,368
Night in the Army then

2551
01:52:26,624 --> 01:52:30,464
Joel is talking about the virus situation

2552
01:52:30,976 --> 01:52:32,512
And he has something

2553
01:52:32,768 --> 01:52:33,792
That he wants to bring

2554
01:52:34,048 --> 01:52:34,560
The table

2555
01:52:36,096 --> 01:52:40,448
Reassurances covid-19 is capable of Airborne transmission

2556
01:52:40,960 --> 01:52:47,104
Oldest for weeks now that you have to actually contact her sneezing or water droplets with a virus

2557
01:52:48,640 --> 01:52:50,688
Make this contagious absolutely false

2558
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:52,736
Princeton University has come out

2559
01:52:57,856 --> 01:52:58,368
Great

2560
01:53:02,208 --> 01:53:02,720
Distinction that I need

2561
01:53:03,744 --> 01:53:06,560
In past episodes I've criticized Stewart Roads in France

2562
01:53:06,816 --> 01:53:07,584
Despoil for assert

2563
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:11,168
The virus is Airborne nothing back in their claims up other than their opinion

2564
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:13,984
There is new information out

2565
01:53:14,240 --> 01:53:15,264
Call some of this into question

2566
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:16,800
Address

2567
01:53:17,824 --> 01:53:20,128
There was a study that came out after our last episode that's

2568
01:53:20,384 --> 01:53:23,456
Suggest that it's possible that the coronavirus can be transmitted in

2569
01:53:23,712 --> 01:53:25,248
In the air with the virus living up

2570
01:53:25,504 --> 01:53:26,528
Up to about 3 hours

2571
01:53:26,784 --> 01:53:27,296
Daenerys alive

2572
01:53:27,552 --> 01:53:28,064
Forum

2573
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:29,344
There are many caveat

2574
01:53:30,112 --> 01:53:34,208
41 the paper is not pure reviewed yet has been no confirmation of the findings

2575
01:53:34,720 --> 01:53:36,256
But even if the study does hold up

2576
01:53:36,768 --> 01:53:37,280
It's not clear what

2577
01:53:37,536 --> 01:53:38,048
Conclusion you should

2578
01:53:38,304 --> 01:53:38,816
To draw from it

2579
01:53:39,328 --> 01:53:42,144
As one of the paper's co-authors Dylan Morris told

2580
01:53:42,656 --> 01:53:48,032
We still don't know how high concentration of viable coronavirus is needed to impact

2581
01:53:48,288 --> 01:53:48,800
Justin Factory

2582
01:53:49,056 --> 01:53:49,568
Human being

2583
01:53:49,824 --> 01:53:51,104
Though this is something we are looking

2584
01:53:51,360 --> 01:53:51,872
Cooking tomatoes in a few

2585
01:53:52,896 --> 01:53:54,176
Disqualifiers very important

2586
01:53:54,944 --> 01:53:57,504
Because the study just claimed to show that the viruses

2587
01:53:58,016 --> 01:54:00,320
Taxable in the air 3 hours after its

2588
01:54:00,576 --> 01:54:04,416
Very well may be that the amount that survives any relevant amount of time right now

2589
01:54:04,672 --> 01:54:05,696
I'll be enough to actually train

2590
01:54:05,952 --> 01:54:06,464
Is that the virus

2591
01:54:07,232 --> 01:54:12,096
Another issue is that the virus can survive 3 hours and air supplies form doesn't mean

2592
01:54:12,352 --> 01:54:14,912
The same thing as if you caught the virus will be in the air for

2593
01:54:15,168 --> 01:54:15,680
For 3 hours

2594
01:54:16,192 --> 01:54:17,984
There is a possibility here though

2595
01:54:18,240 --> 01:54:21,568
And undoubtedly more study will be done on this front wheel no more

2596
01:54:21,824 --> 01:54:22,336
In coming days

2597
01:54:22,592 --> 01:54:23,104
Surrounding

2598
01:54:24,128 --> 01:54:28,224
Another limitation of the study was they didn't even look how how far do you virus scan

2599
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:29,248
Travel in the air

2600
01:54:29,504 --> 01:54:31,040
That's not to say that they were wrong

2601
01:54:32,320 --> 01:54:33,344
Isn't part of the scale.

2602
01:54:34,624 --> 01:54:35,648
Just because it's

2603
01:54:35,904 --> 01:54:40,256
Panda live in the air for long. Of time it doesn't mean that it'll travel travel really far like

2604
01:54:40,512 --> 01:54:41,536
It's been implied by a lot of

2605
01:54:41,792 --> 01:54:42,304
These decks

2606
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:43,584
That's still an open question

2607
01:54:44,608 --> 01:54:46,400
The point here is that there is a study that indicates

2608
01:54:46,656 --> 01:54:49,472
The virus maybe transmittable in the air but I'm here

2609
01:54:49,728 --> 01:54:51,264
Still to tell you that Stuart roads

2610
01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:52,800
And Francis Boyle were wrong

2611
01:54:53,312 --> 01:54:54,848
You did not have any reason

2612
01:54:55,104 --> 01:54:57,152
You say that when they said it okay

2613
01:54:58,176 --> 01:54:59,712
Because this is an indication that

2614
01:54:59,968 --> 01:55:01,248
It's possible that there

2615
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:03,040
Conclusion was correct

2616
01:55:03,296 --> 01:55:05,856
They arrived at it imprecise improperly

2617
01:55:06,112 --> 01:55:07,648
So I still take issue with them

2618
01:55:08,416 --> 01:55:09,184
Wisconsin

2619
01:55:09,440 --> 01:55:10,208
Little bit murkier

2620
01:55:11,232 --> 01:55:12,256
It's like a f******

2621
01:55:12,512 --> 01:55:14,048
Elrond walked out of the woods

2622
01:55:14,304 --> 01:55:15,840
You're not going to be like well obviously

2623
01:55:16,096 --> 01:55:17,888
Tolkien knew that elves were f******

2624
01:55:18,144 --> 01:55:21,216
King real he was making all that s*** up it doesn't matter that elrond

2625
01:55:22,752 --> 01:55:24,800
It said the point is that he was making it up when he said

2626
01:55:26,080 --> 01:55:28,128
It's a little bit Gray

2627
01:55:28,640 --> 01:55:31,200
Do you have no right to report this as solid fact since

2628
01:55:31,456 --> 01:55:33,504
Study is still incomplete at this point and isn't it

2629
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:35,552
Pre Papi reviews

2630
01:55:36,064 --> 01:55:41,184
But here's a little bit more wiggle room to speculate than Alex's other friends did because at least the other source.

2631
01:55:42,208 --> 01:55:44,256
It's not a great source to be certain about just

2632
01:55:44,512 --> 01:55:45,280
Yeah but

2633
01:55:45,536 --> 01:55:46,560
The other dudes were just

2634
01:55:47,584 --> 01:55:48,608
That's just I wasn't claimed

2635
01:55:48,864 --> 01:55:49,376
Princeton put out the

2636
01:55:49,632 --> 01:55:50,912
The study of its kind of imprecise

2637
01:55:51,680 --> 01:55:53,216
The co-author is a grad student iprint

2638
01:55:53,472 --> 01:55:54,240
Distance I'll give him half

2639
01:55:55,520 --> 01:56:00,384
What are the larger points here to is it the co-author himself when speaking to livescience noted that quote

2640
01:56:00,640 --> 01:56:02,176
Even if aerosol transmission

2641
01:56:02,432 --> 01:56:06,016
I can occur it's unlikely to be the primary force driving the current pandemic

2642
01:56:06,528 --> 01:56:08,576
This is primarily because sneezing and coughing

2643
01:56:08,832 --> 01:56:10,880
Do not generally create aerosol size

2644
01:56:11,136 --> 01:56:11,904
It's particles which is what

2645
01:56:12,160 --> 01:56:12,672
The study was lucky

2646
01:56:13,440 --> 01:56:14,208
It doesn't it wouldn't

2647
01:56:14,464 --> 01:56:17,536
Exist according to this article outside generally

2648
01:56:18,048 --> 01:56:18,816
Outside of hospice

2649
01:56:19,072 --> 01:56:22,912
Still super relevant

2650
01:56:23,168 --> 01:56:24,704
It's not the same thing that people like Alex

2651
01:56:25,216 --> 01:56:27,264
And his friends are trying to create

2652
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:32,128
Hysteria or what they're basically saying is that if one

2653
01:56:32,384 --> 01:56:34,688
If one small virus exist

2654
01:56:34,944 --> 01:56:36,736
Anywhere it can infect a human being

2655
01:56:37,248 --> 01:56:43,392
If it's in the air that can breathe it in and that's all it take that's what I don't want the message to be exact

2656
01:56:43,648 --> 01:56:44,160
Not at all

2657
01:56:44,416 --> 01:56:46,208
So I know something weird in this episode

2658
01:56:46,976 --> 01:56:48,000
First volley to loaded with

2659
01:56:48,768 --> 01:56:50,560
We already have Mike Adams of Joel skousen

2660
01:56:50,816 --> 01:56:51,840
There are two more people,

2661
01:56:52,352 --> 01:56:53,376
That alone

2662
01:56:53,632 --> 01:56:54,144
Me too weird

2663
01:56:54,400 --> 01:56:56,448
The show is super

2664
01:56:57,216 --> 01:57:00,032
How to improve the gas to talk to them for a little bit been dissing

2665
01:57:00,544 --> 01:57:02,336
Letting the other person basically host

2666
01:57:02,592 --> 01:57:03,104
The show

2667
01:57:03,360 --> 01:57:06,432
Mike Adams came in and out of brakes on his own

2668
01:57:06,688 --> 01:57:12,320
Mike Adams the show out of commercial breaks to without

2669
01:57:12,576 --> 01:57:13,344
Nowhere to be seen

2670
01:57:14,112 --> 01:57:18,208
In the same way that I look straight up left the show on Wednesday I think he's dipping in and out and letting

2671
01:57:18,464 --> 01:57:18,976
France take over

2672
01:57:19,232 --> 01:57:20,256
Because he's dealing with lawyer

2673
01:57:21,024 --> 01:57:22,816
It sure feels very disorganized

2674
01:57:23,072 --> 01:57:23,840
And like 18th

2675
01:57:24,096 --> 01:57:26,912
Trouble onto on this this Thursday show

2676
01:57:27,680 --> 01:57:28,960
And I will tell you this Jordan

2677
01:57:29,472 --> 01:57:31,008
Joel skousen on his own is boring is she

2678
01:57:31,264 --> 01:57:34,080
Know that old man monotone damn near put me

2679
01:57:34,336 --> 01:57:34,848
Need to sleep

2680
01:57:35,104 --> 01:57:36,384
His main point is basically

2681
01:57:36,640 --> 01:57:41,504
That the virus is the result of offensive bioweapons research is being done by China Inn

2682
01:57:42,272 --> 01:57:44,320
They wanted to take out the west and take over the United

2683
01:57:44,576 --> 01:57:45,600
States with a bioweapon

2684
01:57:45,856 --> 01:57:46,624
But the virus got out some

2685
01:57:46,880 --> 01:57:47,904
So Obama didn't

2686
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:49,952
Well

2687
01:57:50,464 --> 01:57:52,512
I think you could make us compatible

2688
01:57:52,768 --> 01:57:58,656
Obama told them A Primitive form of it and then they experimented on it and then it got free and now we all have zombies

2689
01:57:58,912 --> 01:58:03,008
It's tough to say because that part of the narrative is definitely not Angels guys

2690
01:58:03,520 --> 01:58:04,288
I could see

2691
01:58:04,544 --> 01:58:05,056
Z-Wave

2692
01:58:05,312 --> 01:58:06,592
You could make it work

2693
01:58:06,848 --> 01:58:07,872
Jordan

2694
01:58:09,664 --> 01:58:11,968
I don't think you'll be that car but it also

2695
01:58:12,736 --> 01:58:13,504
Maybe a little silly

2696
01:58:14,272 --> 01:58:15,296
So the way Joel

2697
01:58:15,552 --> 01:58:20,928
Since the virus got out was that the lab as bad process for throwing things away

2698
01:58:21,440 --> 01:58:21,952
To the fish market

2699
01:58:22,464 --> 01:58:25,792
It's unclear who the trash band was

2700
01:58:26,048 --> 01:58:26,560
But

2701
01:58:27,840 --> 01:58:30,144
I would guess that they're not involve the Chinese government

2702
01:58:30,656 --> 01:58:31,168
Because

2703
01:58:31,424 --> 01:58:37,568
You know China was trying to create this project

2704
01:58:37,824 --> 01:58:39,104
He's not big on details pass

2705
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:40,384
The broad conspiracy Strokes

2706
01:58:41,152 --> 01:58:42,944
Anyway he doesn't really

2707
01:58:43,200 --> 01:58:45,248
Get into the Obama selling it like I said

2708
01:58:46,016 --> 01:58:46,528
It just it

2709
01:58:46,784 --> 01:58:49,088
I don't know what I don't know

2710
01:58:49,600 --> 01:58:51,648
It's kind of like he doesn't believe any of Alex's s***

2711
01:58:51,904 --> 01:58:52,416
But you just wants to

2712
01:58:52,672 --> 01:58:56,000
To keep up his uncle's rabid Red Scare mentality keep that alive

2713
01:58:56,256 --> 01:58:58,048
I'm going to go with Luxembourg

2714
01:58:58,304 --> 01:58:59,328
Sandberg has been overlooked for

2715
01:58:59,584 --> 01:59:04,192
For far too long they made this virus to get themselves on the map that's what I'm saying right now

2716
01:59:04,704 --> 01:59:05,728
Maybe that's what I'm thinking

2717
01:59:11,360 --> 01:59:12,640
Alex comes back after

2718
01:59:12,896 --> 01:59:13,408
Skousen host

2719
01:59:13,664 --> 01:59:15,456
Rebet and he's coming in

2720
01:59:15,712 --> 01:59:16,224
Weird

2721
01:59:16,992 --> 01:59:21,344
I've been saying for 34 weeks when you see the celebrity get it

2722
01:59:23,136 --> 01:59:25,696
Shelby Drive

2723
01:59:26,208 --> 01:59:30,048
And I said I believe what I had the crew would go back and find it you all heard it

2724
01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:35,168
That is Soon As Trump acknowledges that it's deadly

2725
01:59:35,680 --> 01:59:36,704
But you'll see them

2726
01:59:37,216 --> 01:59:39,008
Make the weather now

2727
01:59:39,520 --> 01:59:40,288
Doubles

2728
01:59:41,056 --> 01:59:43,104
They had horrible.

2729
01:59:44,128 --> 01:59:50,272
American political activity

2730
01:59:50,528 --> 01:59:53,088
So-called ghetto good boy Tom Hanks

2731
01:59:54,112 --> 01:59:57,184
So-called costar

2732
01:59:57,440 --> 02:00:00,512
Are some movies are making a habit so he's out there all over the news

2733
02:00:01,024 --> 02:00:03,328
Transfer.com doctor claim

2734
02:00:04,864 --> 02:00:05,888
At a gut level

2735
02:00:07,680 --> 02:00:09,472
Especially because it came out

2736
02:00:09,728 --> 02:00:11,008
Why does Trump gave his speech

2737
02:00:12,032 --> 02:00:12,800
Calvary shadow that

2738
02:00:15,360 --> 02:00:17,664
Because of the weird narcissistic needle

2739
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:19,200
Johnson world

2740
02:00:19,712 --> 02:00:22,784
The chicken crab Dimension world of evil

2741
02:00:24,576 --> 02:00:26,368
All they care about is being

2742
02:00:28,160 --> 02:00:33,280
1 oz not been saying for weeks that way you see a celebrity get the virus that's what the Asteria kicks in

2743
02:00:33,536 --> 02:00:37,376
I've been listening pretty consistently and it's definitely not something I would say he's made a point of

2744
02:00:37,888 --> 02:00:39,936
Honestly I don't even remember him saying it ever

2745
02:00:40,192 --> 02:00:42,496
I think he said that Forrest Gump would get the

2746
02:00:42,752 --> 02:00:44,544
The virus reset.com

2747
02:00:44,800 --> 02:00:47,360
It wasn't his co-star it's his wife

2748
02:00:47,616 --> 02:00:48,384
Tom Hanks

2749
02:00:48,640 --> 02:00:49,152
Free

2750
02:00:49,408 --> 02:00:50,432
Alex is probably going to be

2751
02:00:50,688 --> 02:00:51,456
Need that doctors can

2752
02:00:51,712 --> 02:00:54,016
Just come out and say whatever defense here pretty soon

2753
02:00:54,272 --> 02:00:55,296
Nothing as it seems like Trump

2754
02:00:55,552 --> 02:00:56,320
Just keeps getting in the room

2755
02:00:56,576 --> 02:00:58,624
The people who end up testing positive for Corona

2756
02:00:59,648 --> 02:01:02,464
Tom Hanks

2757
02:01:02,720 --> 02:01:04,512
How to overshadow Trump

2758
02:01:04,768 --> 02:01:08,608
The stupidest only one man more famous than Trump then five

2759
02:01:08,864 --> 02:01:12,448
Alex saying the people like Tom Hanks all they care about is being the top story is the

2760
02:01:12,704 --> 02:01:15,520
The clearest case of projection I've ever seen in my life

2761
02:01:15,776 --> 02:01:16,288
Alex

2762
02:01:16,544 --> 02:01:18,848
Stop talking about anytime he's in the Press

2763
02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:20,640
The singular Obsession for him

2764
02:01:21,152 --> 02:01:23,712
Conversely Tom Hanks seems to be a relatively humble person

2765
02:01:23,968 --> 02:01:26,528
As far as celebrities go

2766
02:01:26,784 --> 02:01:30,368
Come on man I think you could do way more attention-seeking Behavior

2767
02:01:30,624 --> 02:01:31,648
And totally get away with it

2768
02:01:31,904 --> 02:01:34,720
Refined living pretty quietly

2769
02:01:34,976 --> 02:01:35,488
Yeah

2770
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:37,792
So earlier I mentioned that Alex theme

2771
02:01:38,048 --> 02:01:38,560
You trying to make a

2772
02:01:38,816 --> 02:01:40,096
A joke out of his arrest

2773
02:01:40,352 --> 02:01:42,144
And you'll see that trend

2774
02:01:42,400 --> 02:01:42,912
Continue here

2775
02:01:43,424 --> 02:01:46,752
And she says people aren't going

2776
02:01:47,264 --> 02:01:48,800
Chinese restaurants

2777
02:01:49,056 --> 02:01:54,432
Racism into I was in one last night was like no one in there

2778
02:02:01,088 --> 02:02:03,392
One of the limit but still it took me to jail do the desk

2779
02:02:03,648 --> 02:02:09,792
By the police department

2780
02:02:10,048 --> 02:02:11,072
Crazy

2781
02:02:14,912 --> 02:02:16,192
But this is all happening

2782
02:02:18,240 --> 02:02:23,360
Silence is trying to use that clip to say that the Democrats are trying to make this virus a situation about race

2783
02:02:23,872 --> 02:02:25,152
Really weird to hear from him because he

2784
02:02:25,408 --> 02:02:28,992
Keep calling you specifically there is that strange

2785
02:02:29,248 --> 02:02:30,016
Anyway you just

2786
02:02:30,272 --> 02:02:30,784
Hear this Lake

2787
02:02:31,552 --> 02:02:33,088
Deflection are you making a joke

2788
02:02:33,600 --> 02:02:35,136
Any continues

2789
02:02:36,160 --> 02:02:37,440
Honestly it sounds

2790
02:02:37,696 --> 02:02:43,840
So silly to say

2791
02:02:50,240 --> 02:02:55,104
Asian restaurant Coronavirus

2792
02:02:58,688 --> 02:02:59,968
They're dropping the charges

2793
02:03:00,224 --> 02:03:02,016
Laughing about this

2794
02:03:02,272 --> 02:03:05,344
We have another guest

2795
02:03:06,112 --> 02:03:11,744
Yeah Yeahs but Alex is trying to deal with the

2796
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:12,512
The situation

2797
02:03:12,768 --> 02:03:13,280
This is

2798
02:03:13,536 --> 02:03:14,048
This is like

2799
02:03:14,304 --> 02:03:20,448
Such that office co-worker everybody knows the story about

2800
02:03:20,704 --> 02:03:21,728
Talk about it

2801
02:03:21,984 --> 02:03:23,264
We don't need all I think it's funny

2802
02:03:23,520 --> 02:03:27,872
No no we decided to talk about what happened to your wife it's if not really I know you're not

2803
02:03:31,456 --> 02:03:32,224
It's

2804
02:03:32,480 --> 02:03:37,600
It is a job. Yeah

2805
02:03:38,880 --> 02:03:39,904
I don't think it is

2806
02:03:41,440 --> 02:03:43,232
Steve bazan

2807
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:45,024
Would be a Steve pieczenik

2808
02:03:46,560 --> 02:03:48,864
Cute coronavirus per hour

2809
02:03:49,120 --> 02:03:50,144
What is already cured

2810
02:03:50,400 --> 02:03:52,960
Himself that is not

2811
02:03:53,216 --> 02:03:55,008
Outrageous thing he asks a good time

2812
02:03:56,288 --> 02:03:58,336
This is this is more geopolitical

2813
02:04:00,384 --> 02:04:01,664
Liberation Army

2814
02:04:03,712 --> 02:04:04,480
Again

2815
02:04:06,784 --> 02:04:08,576
To me as a l

2816
02:04:09,088 --> 02:04:10,880
The people's Liberation Army

2817
02:04:11,392 --> 02:04:13,184
Veggie as a civilian is not

2818
02:04:14,720 --> 02:04:15,488
To be able to

2819
02:04:15,744 --> 02:04:16,768
Hold on to

2820
02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:22,144
Illusion of power

2821
02:04:22,400 --> 02:04:23,936
So Steve would lead a coup against

2822
02:04:24,192 --> 02:04:25,984
G-Man

2823
02:04:26,240 --> 02:04:28,032
I would not recommend that

2824
02:04:28,288 --> 02:04:32,128
Steve

2825
02:04:33,408 --> 02:04:34,432
Jeez acting incompetent

2826
02:04:34,688 --> 02:04:36,992
Particularly a virus outbreak

2827
02:04:37,504 --> 02:04:42,624
I got this interesting because so far in his appearances on the show Steve has been the least critical guest

2828
02:04:42,880 --> 02:04:44,928
As it relates to China that Alex has

2829
02:04:45,440 --> 02:04:46,976
Well Alex and his other friend

2830
02:04:47,232 --> 02:04:50,304
I've been running around like Chicken Little Things yet like I hate over

2831
02:04:50,560 --> 02:04:52,352
Free Humanity or only be Lone Survivor

2832
02:04:52,608 --> 02:04:55,936
Stephen tried to pretend that he was the first person to get the virus in the United States

2833
02:04:56,192 --> 02:04:58,240
Buddy cured itself with large doses of antibiotics

2834
02:04:58,496 --> 02:04:59,520
Not great

2835
02:05:00,032 --> 02:05:00,544
Viruses

2836
02:05:00,800 --> 02:05:01,312
But whatever

2837
02:05:01,824 --> 02:05:03,872
Steve has downplayed the significance of the outbreak

2838
02:05:04,128 --> 02:05:04,640
He's been

2839
02:05:04,896 --> 02:05:06,944
Coordinates of G's lockdown strategies

2840
02:05:07,200 --> 02:05:10,016
This man is leading a coup in China is real

2841
02:05:10,272 --> 02:05:11,040
Out-of-left-field

2842
02:05:11,296 --> 02:05:12,064
Steve then again

2843
02:05:12,576 --> 02:05:13,600
Almost everything he says is

2844
02:05:13,856 --> 02:05:17,184
Complete nonsense so I'm going to let it live in the air

2845
02:05:18,464 --> 02:05:19,232
So Steve

2846
02:05:19,488 --> 02:05:21,280
It's the talking about a trump doing a good job

2847
02:05:21,792 --> 02:05:22,816
And then he said something weird

2848
02:05:23,328 --> 02:05:29,472
The way Trump needs account

2849
02:05:29,728 --> 02:05:31,008
He's providing leadership

2850
02:05:46,624 --> 02:05:47,904
Story would be a pandemic

2851
02:05:48,416 --> 02:05:50,720
It's just a fancy word to say was

2852
02:05:52,256 --> 02:05:54,048
Interesting

2853
02:05:54,560 --> 02:05:57,376
Alexis Abril contradictory.

2854
02:05:57,888 --> 02:06:04,032
I want Andrea Francis Boyle decides the doctor fauci is a Nazi bioweapon research should be arrested

2855
02:06:04,288 --> 02:06:07,104
Spelling for Alex and Alex's picked up on a lot of them

2856
02:06:07,360 --> 02:06:08,896
Turning fauci

2857
02:06:09,152 --> 02:06:11,968
After pretending using Royce the administration

2858
02:06:12,224 --> 02:06:14,784
Alex went 180 on that

2859
02:06:15,040 --> 02:06:16,832
This is a hard to square with Steve

2860
02:06:17,088 --> 02:06:19,648
Fauci is doing a great job and not only that

2861
02:06:19,904 --> 02:06:21,952
Cream Steven med school

2862
02:06:22,464 --> 02:06:26,304
Steve knows this guy super well but also Francis Boyle says he's a Nazi scientist

2863
02:06:26,816 --> 02:06:29,632
If you're listening to this show and you think any of these people are credible

2864
02:06:29,888 --> 02:06:30,656
It seems like that would be

2865
02:06:30,912 --> 02:06:31,936
Hard to deal with

2866
02:06:32,192 --> 02:06:32,704
I

2867
02:06:33,472 --> 02:06:33,984
Are you just

2868
02:06:34,752 --> 02:06:35,520
Did just think

2869
02:06:35,776 --> 02:06:36,800
There's nowhere for Steve

2870
02:06:37,312 --> 02:06:40,896
You always room

2871
02:06:41,152 --> 02:06:45,504
Others claim that Tony fauci trained Steve Cornell

2872
02:06:47,040 --> 02:06:47,552
Possible

2873
02:06:48,064 --> 02:06:49,600
So I found Steve's medical license

2874
02:06:49,856 --> 02:06:53,440
Graduate from high school in 1960

2875
02:06:53,696 --> 02:06:54,208
Okay

2876
02:06:54,464 --> 02:06:55,488
This is a problem

2877
02:06:55,744 --> 02:06:56,512
Because

2878
02:06:57,024 --> 02:06:57,536
Cornell Med

2879
02:06:57,792 --> 02:06:59,584
School definitely not around that time

2880
02:07:00,096 --> 02:07:00,608
However

2881
02:07:00,864 --> 02:07:01,376
Fauci

2882
02:07:01,632 --> 02:07:03,680
Did graduate from Cornell med school in

2883
02:07:04,192 --> 02:07:04,960
1366

2884
02:07:05,472 --> 02:07:07,264
2 years prior to Steve

2885
02:07:07,520 --> 02:07:12,384
All right it'll be easy for him to go immediately turned around

2886
02:07:12,640 --> 02:07:13,152
Teaching

2887
02:07:13,664 --> 02:07:14,176
He didn't

2888
02:07:14,432 --> 02:07:15,712
According to fauci bio

2889
02:07:15,968 --> 02:07:18,016
After graduating in 1966 fauci

2890
02:07:18,272 --> 02:07:20,064
Quote Pursuit house staff training

2891
02:07:20,320 --> 02:07:22,112
In Internal Medicine at the New York

2892
02:07:22,368 --> 02:07:22,880
Hospital

2893
02:07:23,136 --> 02:07:28,256
For 1970 1971 fauci was the chief resident at the New York Hospital Cornell

2894
02:07:28,512 --> 02:07:29,280
Medical Center

2895
02:07:29,536 --> 02:07:31,584
But by that point Steven already graduated from

2896
02:07:31,840 --> 02:07:33,376
From Cornell and according to his license

2897
02:07:33,888 --> 02:07:39,008
Steve did not do an internship or clinical rotations at the New York hospital where fauci would have been

2898
02:07:39,776 --> 02:07:40,800
I'm going to go out on a limb and just

2899
02:07:41,056 --> 02:07:45,664
Assume that Steve realize fauci went to the same bed school is Emily decided to build it into his backstory

2900
02:07:45,920 --> 02:07:47,968
Thought you was basically as mentor and teacher

2901
02:07:48,224 --> 02:07:49,248
I see no evidence

2902
02:07:49,504 --> 02:07:50,784
This is the case and the timeline

2903
02:07:51,040 --> 02:07:52,576
Does not really even possibly work

2904
02:07:52,832 --> 02:07:53,600
God dammit

2905
02:07:54,880 --> 02:07:55,648
Man

2906
02:07:55,904 --> 02:07:56,672
That's just good

2907
02:07:57,184 --> 02:07:57,952
That's just

2908
02:07:58,208 --> 02:07:59,232
Stuff from Steve

2909
02:07:59,488 --> 02:08:02,048
I swear to you I wouldn't even say that he

2910
02:08:02,304 --> 02:08:02,816
Newegg

2911
02:08:03,072 --> 02:08:04,864
Dora I mean like

2912
02:08:05,120 --> 02:08:07,936
I wouldn't say that he knew about you went to Cornell

2913
02:08:09,472 --> 02:08:15,616
I would totally believe that that was a lucky accident no no no

2914
02:08:15,872 --> 02:08:20,736
Be too surprised if Steve might have been acquainted with him

2915
02:08:20,992 --> 02:08:23,296
Not like the classes are probably gigantic

2916
02:08:23,552 --> 02:08:27,392
Who's ahead of him in the program

2917
02:08:27,904 --> 02:08:28,928
This is all both are

2918
02:08:29,440 --> 02:08:32,768
Christ

2919
02:08:33,280 --> 02:08:36,096
Actually I don't know if you know that but I'm adept

2920
02:08:36,352 --> 02:08:37,120
Well done

2921
02:08:37,376 --> 02:08:37,888
Steve

2922
02:08:38,656 --> 02:08:44,544
So it wouldn't be a steeplejack appearance if you didn't say crazy nonsense

2923
02:08:44,800 --> 02:08:47,872
And it also wouldn't be Steve if you didn't say something

2924
02:08:48,384 --> 02:08:49,920
Lake Ripley racist

2925
02:08:50,944 --> 02:08:52,224
Play what you hear

2926
02:08:55,552 --> 02:08:58,624
California dominated by Dairy

2927
02:09:03,744 --> 02:09:05,536
Waxman Berman machinery

2928
02:09:06,048 --> 02:09:09,376
Which literally

2929
02:09:12,704 --> 02:09:13,984
A what now

2930
02:09:14,240 --> 02:09:14,752
Google

2931
02:09:15,008 --> 02:09:16,032
Oh what now

2932
02:09:18,848 --> 02:09:20,896
F*** is this guy

2933
02:09:22,176 --> 02:09:22,944
Bandana

2934
02:09:23,200 --> 02:09:26,272
What I really think is so interesting is that it's so

2935
02:09:27,040 --> 02:09:28,320
Scattershot is it

2936
02:09:28,576 --> 02:09:30,624
Bigotry goes all over the place at these answer

2937
02:09:30,880 --> 02:09:31,392
Acquainted

2938
02:09:31,648 --> 02:09:32,160
Racist

2939
02:09:32,672 --> 02:09:34,720
Close

2940
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:36,512
You just can't

2941
02:09:36,768 --> 02:09:38,304
You just keep waiting for him

2942
02:09:39,072 --> 02:09:40,352
Call Irish people mix

2943
02:09:40,608 --> 02:09:43,424
Like what are you coming

2944
02:09:43,936 --> 02:09:45,984
So Steve gets into talking about Trump

2945
02:09:46,496 --> 02:09:49,824
Good but in doing so he kind of describes trampas really

2946
02:09:50,336 --> 02:09:50,848
Yeah

2947
02:09:51,104 --> 02:09:53,920
The truth

2948
02:09:54,176 --> 02:09:55,200
The guy from here

2949
02:09:55,456 --> 02:10:00,064
California

2950
02:10:00,576 --> 02:10:02,624
Which president XI or food

2951
02:10:02,880 --> 02:10:03,648
We've never had

2952
02:10:05,184 --> 02:10:07,488
He understands the personality

2953
02:10:07,744 --> 02:10:09,792
Because

2954
02:10:10,048 --> 02:10:11,840
That's not that's not what I

2955
02:10:12,352 --> 02:10:17,728
I don't want a president who sees Mafia guys and he's like I like that guy I'd get along with Hank

2956
02:10:17,984 --> 02:10:18,496
That's not good

2957
02:10:19,008 --> 02:10:19,776
These people are in

2958
02:10:21,312 --> 02:10:24,384
That is that is incredible what do you think you wanting to l

2959
02:10:24,640 --> 02:10:26,944
I want to be mobbed up into really kind of just

2960
02:10:27,200 --> 02:10:30,016
Feel things out I wanted to be super mobbed-up

2961
02:10:30,272 --> 02:10:32,576
And also want to take over space

2962
02:10:34,112 --> 02:10:34,624
Increase

2963
02:10:35,648 --> 02:10:37,440
Is Space Warfare

2964
02:10:37,696 --> 02:10:38,976
Not just an asset

2965
02:10:39,232 --> 02:10:40,000
What does Facebook

2966
02:10:48,960 --> 02:10:52,544
And we don't want any more Connecticut action otherwise we don't eat

2967
02:10:52,800 --> 02:10:56,128
Tanks we don't need any Bazookas we don't need

2968
02:10:57,152 --> 02:11:01,760
Destroyer summary

2969
02:11:05,088 --> 02:11:09,184
These dudes are pushing for is a explicit breach of international law

2970
02:11:09,440 --> 02:11:13,280
There's a little thing called the outer space treaty that was signed back in 1966

2971
02:11:13,792 --> 02:11:14,560
She graduated

2972
02:11:15,840 --> 02:11:18,400
Jesus words known as space law

2973
02:11:19,168 --> 02:11:21,984
3D pretty clear that exploration of space is open to all country

2974
02:11:22,240 --> 02:11:23,264
And their purpose needs

2975
02:11:23,520 --> 02:11:24,032
To be peaceful

2976
02:11:24,544 --> 02:11:27,104
Only specifically bands the installation

2977
02:11:27,360 --> 02:11:28,896
The deployment of nuclear weapons and weapons

2978
02:11:29,152 --> 02:11:30,432
The master struction

2979
02:11:30,688 --> 02:11:35,040
I have to assume that a star destroyer that I was imagining would qualify as a wmd

2980
02:11:35,808 --> 02:11:41,952
My main point here and this might be the name of my book If I ever write one is that Alex Jones really just wants to be one of them

2981
02:11:42,208 --> 02:11:43,232
Bad guys in Star Wars

2982
02:11:43,744 --> 02:11:45,792
He constantly does impressions of emperor

2983
02:11:46,304 --> 02:11:48,096
He comes in from break with the Imperial March

2984
02:11:48,352 --> 02:11:51,168
Constantly almost never talks about the Jedi or the rebels

2985
02:11:51,680 --> 02:11:52,704
Alex is just a f******

2986
02:11:52,960 --> 02:11:56,032
Can Syfy dork who likes the bad guys

2987
02:11:56,288 --> 02:11:56,800
I'm surprised

2988
02:11:57,056 --> 02:11:57,568
Stevie B

2989
02:11:57,824 --> 02:12:03,712
Cvbz had been quicker you have been like oh yeah Star Destroyers you know I wrote the original Star Wars with George Lucas

2990
02:12:03,968 --> 02:12:06,016
He trained me at Cornell as well in screenwriting

2991
02:12:08,320 --> 02:12:08,832
So

2992
02:12:09,344 --> 02:12:11,648
You know the United States is setup is a

2993
02:12:12,416 --> 02:12:15,488
Non religious country connote the secular

2994
02:12:15,744 --> 02:12:16,256
Alex

2995
02:12:16,512 --> 02:12:19,840
It is weird weird extreme is Christianity

2996
02:12:20,096 --> 02:12:23,168
Country with the religion of America

2997
02:12:23,680 --> 02:12:26,496
If we had one religion it's not Christianity

2998
02:12:33,152 --> 02:12:34,944
Entrepreneur country

2999
02:12:35,200 --> 02:12:39,296
I can make any f******

3000
02:12:39,552 --> 02:12:40,576
To pay the penalty

3001
02:12:40,832 --> 02:12:42,624
Of disgrace as I would in Europe

3002
02:12:42,880 --> 02:12:43,648
China

3003
02:12:43,904 --> 02:12:44,672
Ornacia

3004
02:12:44,928 --> 02:12:46,208
So why don't you

3005
02:12:46,464 --> 02:12:49,024
Wild West

3006
02:12:49,536 --> 02:12:52,096
Self-sufficiency entrepreneur

3007
02:12:52,352 --> 02:12:54,400
And the ability to make

3008
02:12:54,656 --> 02:13:00,800
And everybody would buy into an idea

3009
02:13:09,248 --> 02:13:14,880
You're very bright man and underneath

3010
02:13:19,488 --> 02:13:21,792
They tend to be the best actors

3011
02:13:22,816 --> 02:13:28,448
Rata Tommy Levy come back to everybody calling me I'm getting constant streams

3012
02:13:28,704 --> 02:13:34,336
Real hard real hard right after Steve calls Alex and actor and

3013
02:13:34,848 --> 02:13:35,360
Yeah there is

3014
02:13:37,664 --> 02:13:38,176
I love this

3015
02:13:38,432 --> 02:13:43,040
Steve couldn't even keep like from lasting when he's like you're very good at getting your point

3016
02:13:44,576 --> 02:13:45,344
So Alex gets

3017
02:13:45,600 --> 02:13:47,136
To talk in here about

3018
02:13:47,392 --> 02:13:47,904
The silver

3019
02:13:48,416 --> 02:13:49,696
Again he's very

3020
02:13:49,952 --> 02:13:51,232
Kinds of about it

3021
02:13:51,488 --> 02:13:52,000
Beat a lot

3022
02:13:52,256 --> 02:13:52,768
And that's because it's

3023
02:13:53,024 --> 02:13:54,048
Comes up a lot

3024
02:14:00,192 --> 02:14:02,752
Let's go over the facts by lawyers

3025
02:14:05,312 --> 02:14:10,432
Technology

3026
02:14:10,944 --> 02:14:12,992
At the first line of defense in hospitals

3027
02:14:13,248 --> 02:14:14,016
Health clinics

3028
02:14:14,272 --> 02:14:19,136
Bacterial infection the Pentagon also uses

3029
02:14:19,904 --> 02:14:23,744
Call Keri Carlton

3030
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:25,792
Science Center

3031
02:14:27,584 --> 02:14:28,864
Wunderground ridges

3032
02:14:29,888 --> 02:14:34,240
Retesting and has been found to kill Anthrax bubonic plague

3033
02:14:35,008 --> 02:14:36,544
Hospital staff in SARS

3034
02:14:36,800 --> 02:14:37,824
Years ago

3035
02:14:38,592 --> 02:14:41,664
Dial and have relied upon it making

3036
02:14:41,920 --> 02:14:42,944
Stationary

3037
02:14:48,064 --> 02:14:50,112
Cleared a double-blind human

3038
02:14:51,648 --> 02:14:52,672
Jackson studies

3039
02:14:52,928 --> 02:14:53,952
Over-the-counter sale

3040
02:14:54,464 --> 02:14:59,072
Do all the claims being made about the nano silver in this statement

3041
02:14:59,328 --> 02:15:00,096
The topical

3042
02:15:00,608 --> 02:15:03,936
If you were only two made these claims about the jail being effective against

3043
02:15:04,192 --> 02:15:07,520
I'm sorry I probably wouldn't be brought up weeks ago when he started selling

3044
02:15:07,776 --> 02:15:08,544
Toothpaste in cargo

3045
02:15:08,800 --> 02:15:09,312
Call the way he has

3046
02:15:10,080 --> 02:15:15,456
I'm not certain about all the particular details but he does seem to have some pieces to make claims about the topical gel

3047
02:15:15,968 --> 02:15:17,760
It's just these claims cannot be made about the

3048
02:15:18,016 --> 02:15:18,528
Completely

3049
02:15:18,784 --> 02:15:19,552
Product because

3050
02:15:19,808 --> 02:15:21,088
Dad some of the same ingredients

3051
02:15:22,368 --> 02:15:24,672
You talk to them about the other studies in the research

3052
02:15:26,208 --> 02:15:29,280
You go to the silver company's website at Silver biotics. Net

3053
02:15:29,536 --> 02:15:30,560
Dot-com

3054
02:15:31,072 --> 02:15:32,352
Where you'll find a sub page

3055
02:15:32,608 --> 02:15:33,376
Title research

3056
02:15:34,144 --> 02:15:34,912
The researchers split

3057
02:15:35,168 --> 02:15:35,680
2 second

3058
02:15:36,448 --> 02:15:39,264
The first is 9 studies about the wound gel

3059
02:15:39,520 --> 02:15:41,568
And it's used as an over-the-counter medication

3060
02:15:42,336 --> 02:15:43,104
The second section

3061
02:15:43,360 --> 02:15:44,128
Is where Alex gets in

3062
02:15:44,384 --> 02:15:45,408
The trouble is that about

3063
02:15:45,664 --> 02:15:46,176
Ingestion

3064
02:15:46,432 --> 02:15:46,944
Studies

3065
02:15:47,712 --> 02:15:49,760
That section is a collection of Six studies

3066
02:15:50,016 --> 02:15:50,528
Silver biotics

3067
02:15:50,784 --> 02:15:52,320
Text David involving whether or not it's safe

3068
02:15:52,576 --> 02:15:53,600
To ingest their silver

3069
02:15:54,112 --> 02:15:54,624
In the application

3070
02:15:54,880 --> 02:15:55,392
The gargle

3071
02:15:55,904 --> 02:15:57,440
None of these studies demonstrate that the

3072
02:15:57,696 --> 02:16:00,512
The same medicinal qualities apply to the ingested silver

3073
02:16:00,768 --> 02:16:02,560
Just their product is safe for humans

3074
02:16:02,816 --> 02:16:03,328
The consumed

3075
02:16:04,096 --> 02:16:10,240
You cannot take this compilation of research and conclude that it's Africa Laura Justified to sell the gargoyle the way that you

3076
02:16:10,496 --> 02:16:11,008
You might

3077
02:16:11,776 --> 02:16:13,056
Simply but Alex says no.

3078
02:16:14,080 --> 02:16:14,848
If he continues

3079
02:16:15,104 --> 02:16:15,616
Push the issue

3080
02:16:16,640 --> 02:16:18,176
And if the State Attorney General

3081
02:16:18,432 --> 02:16:20,992
Like their office follow through with their warning

3082
02:16:21,760 --> 02:16:22,784
Alex is going to be fine

3083
02:16:23,040 --> 02:16:23,808
Lot of money

3084
02:16:24,320 --> 02:16:24,832
Can't wait

3085
02:16:26,368 --> 02:16:27,904
Very bad I hope so

3086
02:16:28,160 --> 02:16:30,208
Defensive more

3087
02:16:30,464 --> 02:16:31,232
I didn't say you could

3088
02:16:31,488 --> 02:16:33,024
You're the virus with this

3089
02:16:33,280 --> 02:16:36,096
They're really pissed off right now folks

3090
02:16:37,376 --> 02:16:40,192
That that that people are getting this and protect themselves

3091
02:16:40,960 --> 02:16:42,496
Around tattletaling

3092
02:16:43,008 --> 02:16:45,824
Misrepresent what's going on and it's just not going to work

3093
02:16:46,592 --> 02:16:48,896
Know if you already have this David you are you're inside

3094
02:16:49,664 --> 02:16:52,736
Obviously taking silver is going to protect you buy me some Frontline

3095
02:16:52,992 --> 02:16:55,552
On your hands

3096
02:16:56,064 --> 02:16:59,392
Another buffer against a tech it out

3097
02:17:08,864 --> 02:17:13,984
Even if you ignore all the times that Alex very clearly implied that is toothpaste and gargle could knock out

3098
02:17:14,240 --> 02:17:15,008
The Coronavirus

3099
02:17:15,264 --> 02:17:16,288
He's still on the wrong side

3100
02:17:17,056 --> 02:17:20,128
At the end are you saying that the product being in your throat will have a protective

3101
02:17:20,384 --> 02:17:24,224
Facts against the virus and that's still not something you can back up with any evidence

3102
02:17:24,736 --> 02:17:28,320
It's just as illegal to promote this as a coronavirus cure as it is

3103
02:17:28,576 --> 02:17:29,088
Promoted ism

3104
02:17:29,600 --> 02:17:30,112
The prevention

3105
02:17:30,624 --> 02:17:31,392
Simply put

3106
02:17:31,648 --> 02:17:33,184
If things go the way they should

3107
02:17:33,952 --> 02:17:34,464
Is f*****

3108
02:17:34,720 --> 02:17:36,256
He's just digging himself deeper

3109
02:17:37,024 --> 02:17:37,792
Digging deeper

3110
02:17:39,840 --> 02:17:40,352
Speaking a digger

3111
02:17:41,632 --> 02:17:42,144
Let's dig in

3112
02:17:42,400 --> 02:17:44,192
Is Alex at his last gasp coming up

3113
02:17:44,448 --> 02:17:44,960
And guess what

3114
02:17:45,728 --> 02:17:46,240
You dumb

3115
02:17:47,008 --> 02:17:47,776
Either Catholic facts

3116
02:17:48,288 --> 02:17:49,312
Great it's Milo yiannopoulos

3117
02:17:50,336 --> 02:17:51,872
I've been spending

3118
02:17:52,128 --> 02:17:53,152
The last couple of weeks

3119
02:17:53,408 --> 02:17:58,528
Trying to avoid this history about coronavirus

3120
02:17:58,784 --> 02:18:00,832
It's not entirely clear to me that even exist

3121
02:18:06,720 --> 02:18:08,000
President thinks that I'll be know if you can

3122
02:18:08,256 --> 02:18:12,096
They just closed down hockey but I just now few minutes ago might not exist

3123
02:18:17,216 --> 02:18:19,008
What's going on but he has some theories

3124
02:18:19,264 --> 02:18:20,032
Stupid

3125
02:18:21,568 --> 02:18:24,128
There is some kind of flu

3126
02:18:24,384 --> 02:18:26,688
Antiseptic

3127
02:18:26,944 --> 02:18:28,736
Already

3128
02:18:28,992 --> 02:18:31,040
Has been existed

3129
02:18:35,392 --> 02:18:35,904
Is manafort

3130
02:18:36,160 --> 02:18:38,720
And clearly it is serving one particular

3131
02:18:38,976 --> 02:18:43,072
Side of the political aisle who all going in ham on it for like four reasons

3132
02:18:43,584 --> 02:18:45,376
I understand Bi-Lo being stupid enough

3133
02:18:45,632 --> 02:18:48,448
Just see that Clorox meme that was going around or someone pointed out that

3134
02:18:48,704 --> 02:18:49,472
Coronavirus

3135
02:18:49,728 --> 02:18:51,776
On the back of the bottle

3136
02:18:52,032 --> 02:18:53,824
Get into into it any further or whatever

3137
02:18:54,080 --> 02:18:57,664
Next total sense cuz he's a lazy fraud but I have a real problem with Alex

3138
02:18:57,920 --> 02:19:00,224
Disagreeing with this narrative the Milo's putting out

3139
02:19:00,736 --> 02:19:01,504
That's because

3140
02:19:01,760 --> 02:19:04,064
Alex knows damn well that coronavirus is the name of

3141
02:19:04,320 --> 02:19:04,832
The family

3142
02:19:05,600 --> 02:19:08,928
He talked about it a lot it's a family in Vancouver Lee when he's in the middle of a

3143
02:19:09,184 --> 02:19:10,464
Sales pitch for his silver

3144
02:19:10,976 --> 02:19:13,536
This is the piece of information that Alex cannot

3145
02:19:15,072 --> 02:19:18,400
So he's either completely checked out as a thinker and just you know whatever

3146
02:19:18,912 --> 02:19:21,728
Dumb guest says are presented as credible

3147
02:19:21,984 --> 02:19:23,008
Visible Changes

3148
02:19:23,520 --> 02:19:24,288
See the audience

3149
02:19:24,544 --> 02:19:25,056
There's no way around it

3150
02:19:25,568 --> 02:19:28,384
It continues they're pretending like they don't know that it

3151
02:19:28,640 --> 02:19:29,408
The family of virus

3152
02:19:30,688 --> 02:19:33,248
Stuff for year

3153
02:19:34,528 --> 02:19:35,296
Because it's because

3154
02:19:35,552 --> 02:19:36,832
Later it's

3155
02:19:37,088 --> 02:19:41,952
As far as I can tell it's a man-made thing everyone's known about for a while it's just you know who reads the back of these bottles right

3156
02:19:42,720 --> 02:19:44,512
Someone noticed somewhere

3157
02:19:44,768 --> 02:19:47,072
Somewhere somehow Dan

3158
02:19:47,328 --> 02:19:51,936
Against all available on somebody looked at the back of one of those things

3159
02:19:52,192 --> 02:19:52,704
This is just

3160
02:19:52,960 --> 02:19:53,472
Really stupid

3161
02:19:54,240 --> 02:19:55,776
So Alex gets into like

3162
02:19:56,288 --> 02:19:57,312
Talking about how like

3163
02:19:57,568 --> 02:19:58,336
Hey you know what

3164
02:19:58,592 --> 02:19:59,872
I would make more money

3165
02:20:00,384 --> 02:20:01,408
I said that this is like

3166
02:20:02,432 --> 02:20:02,944
End of the world

3167
02:20:03,456 --> 02:20:06,272
How to say that

3168
02:20:06,528 --> 02:20:08,576
More products

3169
02:20:08,832 --> 02:20:11,392
People need to the Morrigan and coil silver

3170
02:20:11,904 --> 02:20:13,952
Anyway sir live

3171
02:20:25,216 --> 02:20:31,360
Do you think there's a Supercut, I can't think of any time that he has said that it worked for him at home only be Lone Survivor

3172
02:20:31,616 --> 02:20:32,640
Alright well you got one

3173
02:20:33,408 --> 02:20:34,688
Collapse of civilization

3174
02:20:34,944 --> 02:20:35,712
Oh okay so that's

3175
02:20:37,760 --> 02:20:39,296
And so that's where all this is going

3176
02:20:39,808 --> 02:20:41,088
How do we know when it's getting kind

3177
02:20:42,624 --> 02:20:43,648
Take it on our own to just

3178
02:20:44,672 --> 02:20:50,560
Get away from the world I was retired and didn't have to be in Austin I would already be preparing the next few weeks to leave

3179
02:20:50,816 --> 02:20:54,656
Okay so that's

3180
02:20:55,680 --> 02:20:56,960
Then bombing as soon as

3181
02:20:57,216 --> 02:20:57,728
Possible

3182
02:20:57,984 --> 02:21:02,080
So I mean if I was saying I could have made more money if I tell people to head to tails

3183
02:21:02,336 --> 02:21:03,872
You literally are telling collars

3184
02:21:04,128 --> 02:21:06,176
Is 880 atleast

3185
02:21:07,456 --> 02:21:08,224
Exactly what you f******

3186
02:21:08,480 --> 02:21:08,992
Can say

3187
02:21:11,040 --> 02:21:16,672
Milo has a stupid narrative pitch bats New Jersey making it illegal

3188
02:21:16,928 --> 02:21:17,440
Ulta spread missing

3189
02:21:18,464 --> 02:21:18,976
About to Coronavirus

3190
02:21:19,232 --> 02:21:25,376
New Jersey

3191
02:21:25,632 --> 02:21:28,448
For spreading misinformation

3192
02:21:30,496 --> 02:21:35,360
Okay

3193
02:21:40,736 --> 02:21:42,784
So they're already existing laws on the books

3194
02:21:43,040 --> 02:21:44,576
The New Jersey that make it illegal to quote

3195
02:21:44,832 --> 02:21:46,368
Cause false public alarm

3196
02:21:46,880 --> 02:21:47,904
All the typing right now is

3197
02:21:48,160 --> 02:21:51,488
The Department of Public Safety in New Jersey is come out and said that they're going to

3198
02:21:51,744 --> 02:21:54,304
Enforce those already existing laws in the situation

3199
02:21:54,560 --> 02:21:55,328
Coronavirus

3200
02:21:56,096 --> 02:21:56,608
Directionality

3201
02:21:56,864 --> 02:21:57,376
Pretty simple

3202
02:21:57,632 --> 02:22:01,984
Individuals who make any false or basis reports about The coronavirus in Newark

3203
02:22:02,496 --> 02:22:03,264
Domino's

3204
02:22:03,776 --> 02:22:06,080
They can result in injury to Residents and visitors

3205
02:22:06,592 --> 02:22:07,360
And effect

3206
02:22:07,616 --> 02:22:10,176
Houses of worship businesses and entire neighborhoods

3207
02:22:10,944 --> 02:22:15,040
I think Milo will be in the clear unless he'd Start Spreading lies pacifically about Newark

3208
02:22:15,296 --> 02:22:16,064
Alex's show

3209
02:22:16,832 --> 02:22:18,624
There are people who've said that this is a violation of

3210
02:22:18,880 --> 02:22:19,392
The first event

3211
02:22:19,648 --> 02:22:20,416
But it's not really

3212
02:22:20,928 --> 02:22:24,768
It's more just an extension of the principle that says you can't yell fire in a crowded theater

3213
02:22:25,280 --> 02:22:28,096
Your free speech rights don't extend to being able to use them in ways

3214
02:22:28,352 --> 02:22:29,120
The cause real damage

3215
02:22:29,376 --> 02:22:32,192
The other people hence the laws against slander or extortion

3216
02:22:32,704 --> 02:22:35,264
Those are just the words you're using but they aren't protected

3217
02:22:36,544 --> 02:22:39,104
Things like this are real concerns for lazy propagandist

3218
02:22:39,360 --> 02:22:40,384
Like Milo and Alex

3219
02:22:40,640 --> 02:22:41,920
Because deep down they know that

3220
02:22:42,176 --> 02:22:44,480
When they're questioned when they're forced to defend their position

3221
02:22:44,992 --> 02:22:45,504
We cannot

3222
02:22:46,016 --> 02:22:49,600
We've seen Alex and his dumb Friends under deposition you see how they shrivel up and

3223
02:22:49,856 --> 02:22:50,368
Play dumb

3224
02:22:50,624 --> 02:22:51,904
Weather Astor Defender most Bass

3225
02:22:52,160 --> 02:22:52,672
Reporting

3226
02:22:52,928 --> 02:22:53,952
Cuz they're not facing

3227
02:22:54,208 --> 02:22:55,488
Any of the s*** they're saying on anything

3228
02:22:56,256 --> 02:23:00,608
The prospect of being questioned or investigated by causing a false Panic is really dangerous for them

3229
02:23:00,864 --> 02:23:05,216
Because all this it's man-made and Obama sold to China stuff that won't hold up

3230
02:23:05,472 --> 02:23:07,008
Under examination

3231
02:23:07,776 --> 02:23:08,544
Now it's knows that

3232
02:23:09,056 --> 02:23:10,848
Deep down he knows he's guilty of causing

3233
02:23:12,640 --> 02:23:15,200
I need desperately doesn't want to face that kind of music

3234
02:23:15,456 --> 02:23:18,784
300 behind this pathetic Shield that everything he does is protected by the first

3235
02:23:19,040 --> 02:23:21,600
And we'll see how long that holds up but for now

3236
02:23:21,856 --> 02:23:22,368
Whatever

3237
02:23:23,648 --> 02:23:24,416
Why they go to break

3238
02:23:24,928 --> 02:23:25,440
The comeback

3239
02:23:26,208 --> 02:23:26,720
And

3240
02:23:30,816 --> 02:23:32,096
This might be a little gross

3241
02:23:32,352 --> 02:23:33,632
Warning in advance

3242
02:23:33,888 --> 02:23:40,032
Infowars

3243
02:23:49,760 --> 02:23:53,856
Allowed

3244
02:23:54,112 --> 02:24:00,256
Take care of this right now

3245
02:24:12,032 --> 02:24:14,080
Thank you very much for this

3246
02:24:16,384 --> 02:24:17,152
There's quite a bit of

3247
02:24:17,408 --> 02:24:21,504
This kind of talk throughout the rest of their interview but I'd say that's a good enough sample

3248
02:24:21,760 --> 02:24:23,808
Pretty gross gross

3249
02:24:24,320 --> 02:24:27,392
Pretty goddamn gross do you guys not know you're on air

3250
02:24:27,648 --> 02:24:28,928
Does any is anybody

3251
02:24:29,440 --> 02:24:31,232
Hey babe

3252
02:24:31,488 --> 02:24:35,840
Just empty on baby

3253
02:24:36,096 --> 02:24:37,632
I feel like they're just a loan

3254
02:24:37,888 --> 02:24:39,680
Sitting in there like it does it.

3255
02:24:39,936 --> 02:24:45,056
Optical illusion like if you turn the cameras around is an entirely empty thing in this is The Truman Show

3256
02:24:46,848 --> 02:24:50,944
Well I mean if your theory but they don't know that they're on bikes

3257
02:24:51,456 --> 02:24:55,040
Is kind of supported when they start talking about Alex's appearance his new

3258
02:24:55,296 --> 02:24:55,808
Look

3259
02:24:56,320 --> 02:24:58,368
When is bald head man

3260
02:24:58,880 --> 02:25:05,024
The normal circumstances this combination I'm always wary of it cuz I think everybody looks kind of a rainy and dinner with the Vietnam

3261
02:25:05,280 --> 02:25:10,912
Bald head

3262
02:25:11,168 --> 02:25:15,008
How cool is there any sentence today today that doesn't have casual race

3263
02:25:15,264 --> 02:25:18,080
I'm dripping all over with Milo is like

3264
02:25:18,848 --> 02:25:24,992
He's trying to act like he's trying to get a rise out of people by being like racist funny

3265
02:25:25,248 --> 02:25:27,808
But he's not funny and he's a racist

3266
02:25:28,320 --> 02:25:28,832
Yeah

3267
02:25:29,088 --> 02:25:30,880
So yeah that's that's Bass

3268
02:25:31,136 --> 02:25:32,160
Sickly.

3269
02:25:33,184 --> 02:25:36,768
So the reason that Milo's on the show is because he's rich

3270
02:25:37,024 --> 02:25:38,304
Book about Rodger Stone

3271
02:25:38,560 --> 02:25:43,168
Trial in about how Rodger got set up care about any of this because

3272
02:25:43,424 --> 02:25:43,936
Milo have

3273
02:25:44,192 --> 02:25:45,728
Because it's a book about Rodger being set up

3274
02:25:46,240 --> 02:25:46,752
Can't imagine

3275
02:25:47,008 --> 02:25:48,288
A combination of two things interest

3276
02:25:48,544 --> 02:25:49,568
Sing me laugh

3277
02:25:50,336 --> 02:25:55,200
But they end up attending the show to talk about that a bit they end up ripping a bit about

3278
02:25:55,456 --> 02:25:55,968
The judge

3279
02:25:56,224 --> 02:25:56,736
Amy Berman

3280
02:25:56,992 --> 02:25:57,504
Jackson

3281
02:25:57,760 --> 02:26:00,064
Right now we're committing

3282
02:26:00,576 --> 02:26:02,112
Alex try some comedy out here

3283
02:26:02,368 --> 02:26:03,136
And this is

3284
02:26:03,648 --> 02:26:04,160
Bad

3285
02:26:04,672 --> 02:26:06,464
Berman

3286
02:26:09,536 --> 02:26:10,304
Well it's

3287
02:26:15,168 --> 02:26:17,728
Let's just say

3288
02:26:24,896 --> 02:26:31,040
Penis

3289
02:26:34,624 --> 02:26:35,648
Yeah it's not a good joke

3290
02:26:36,672 --> 02:26:37,696
First I mean

3291
02:26:37,952 --> 02:26:38,720
Beaches are

3292
02:26:39,488 --> 02:26:40,256
Typically female dog

3293
02:26:40,768 --> 02:26:46,912
This is the construction is bad on this joke the deliveries sloppy to the point where even Alex's douchey edgy comedy but

3294
02:26:47,168 --> 02:26:47,936
Buddy Milo tells him

3295
02:26:48,192 --> 02:26:48,704
Stop it

3296
02:26:48,960 --> 02:26:51,264
Eddie can't even keep up with what Alex is trying to get at

3297
02:26:51,776 --> 02:26:54,080
This like honestly is lower than open

3298
02:26:54,336 --> 02:26:54,848
My quality

3299
02:26:56,640 --> 02:26:58,176
When are you listen too much

3300
02:26:58,432 --> 02:26:59,712
Or any more of that

3301
02:26:59,968 --> 02:27:00,736
Will jump

3302
02:27:00,992 --> 02:27:01,504
The 13th

3303
02:27:01,760 --> 02:27:02,528
Friday the 13

3304
02:27:04,064 --> 02:27:04,576
Perhaps

3305
02:27:04,832 --> 02:27:05,600
Bad omen

3306
02:27:05,856 --> 02:27:08,416
Oh no I mean we're recording on the Ides of March

3307
02:27:08,672 --> 02:27:09,952
Stand this is the bad Omen right

3308
02:27:10,208 --> 02:27:10,720
I hear

3309
02:27:11,488 --> 02:27:14,048
Alex said starts the show with the big breaking news

3310
02:27:15,072 --> 02:27:20,448
I told you this 2 weeks ago I said FEMA has already declared secretly an actual emergency

3311
02:27:21,216 --> 02:27:26,080
And I said in two weeks being pulled off

3312
02:27:26,592 --> 02:27:28,128
Assemble into weeks

3313
02:27:29,408 --> 02:27:30,944
Just about

3314
02:27:31,712 --> 02:27:32,480
18 days ago

3315
02:27:33,248 --> 02:27:34,528
I said within two weeks

3316
02:27:34,784 --> 02:27:36,320
President Trump will declare

3317
02:27:36,832 --> 02:27:37,856
Financial emergency

3318
02:27:38,880 --> 02:27:41,440
Got it in place before they

3319
02:27:41,952 --> 02:27:42,720
Play roll it out

3320
02:27:42,976 --> 02:27:46,560
Two weeks ago Alex is trying to pick a fight with Sebastian Gorka

3321
02:27:47,328 --> 02:27:52,960
To be fair on March 3rd approximately 2 weeks prior to this episode Alex did say the trumpet secretly declared a national emergency

3322
02:27:53,216 --> 02:27:53,984
And see about about the prior

3323
02:27:54,496 --> 02:27:55,008
That wasn't

3324
02:27:55,264 --> 02:27:56,288
True that it's still not

3325
02:27:56,544 --> 02:27:58,848
Grudgingly declared an emergency

3326
02:27:59,104 --> 02:28:01,664
In no way proves that there was a secret emergency

3327
02:28:01,920 --> 02:28:02,688
She previously made

3328
02:28:03,712 --> 02:28:04,736
Nonsense

3329
02:28:06,784 --> 02:28:07,296
I just don't

3330
02:28:08,576 --> 02:28:12,416
There's just no way there's no way to break the propaganda firewall

3331
02:28:12,672 --> 02:28:13,696
Like if you probably not

3332
02:28:13,952 --> 02:28:17,280
If you can't look at what Trump is doing now and CA

3333
02:28:17,536 --> 02:28:18,560
An incompetent

3334
02:28:19,072 --> 02:28:19,840
Moronic

3335
02:28:20,096 --> 02:28:21,888
Huckster

3336
02:28:23,424 --> 02:28:24,448
But they're still

3337
02:28:27,264 --> 02:28:29,056
If you don't see it now that you're never coming

3338
02:28:30,080 --> 02:28:31,360
Two glaring

3339
02:28:31,616 --> 02:28:32,128
Yeah

3340
02:28:32,384 --> 02:28:32,896
To glare

3341
02:28:33,408 --> 02:28:33,920
Yeah it's tough

3342
02:28:34,176 --> 02:28:34,688
I got you can

3343
02:28:34,944 --> 02:28:36,224
Call the six-year-old be like

3344
02:28:36,480 --> 02:28:41,344
What is a better but I could make that argument about so many of the things

3345
02:28:41,600 --> 02:28:42,624
But Alex has done over

3346
02:28:42,880 --> 02:28:43,648
Over the course of his career

3347
02:28:43,904 --> 02:28:45,696
And equally valid

3348
02:28:45,952 --> 02:28:48,000
True absolutely true

3349
02:28:48,256 --> 02:28:49,024
Is bad day out

3350
02:28:49,280 --> 02:28:49,792
The world

3351
02:28:50,048 --> 02:28:51,328
Yeah that is that is the other

3352
02:28:52,096 --> 02:28:53,888
So Alex just ends up on the 30

3353
02:28:54,144 --> 02:28:54,912
You just making

3354
02:28:55,168 --> 02:28:56,960
You shut up about the public house

3355
02:28:57,216 --> 02:28:57,728
Situation

3356
02:28:57,984 --> 02:29:00,032
Airborne HIV

3357
02:29:01,056 --> 02:29:05,664
Just like HIV gives you pneumonia and cancer and heart attacks and and I forgot heavy doesn't

3358
02:29:07,456 --> 02:29:10,272
Obama and the US government

3359
02:29:10,528 --> 02:29:12,576
Create

3360
02:29:16,928 --> 02:29:19,488
They've released it is their big temper tantrum

3361
02:29:20,256 --> 02:29:22,560
Don't worry that got treatment for at all

3362
02:29:24,608 --> 02:29:25,888
Obama selling it

3363
02:29:26,144 --> 02:29:26,912
To China is not

3364
02:29:28,704 --> 02:29:29,728
Among other problems

3365
02:29:30,752 --> 02:29:34,848
Hysteria going on I would argue any of that Alex

3366
02:29:35,360 --> 02:29:35,872
Is involved with it

3367
02:29:36,128 --> 02:29:36,896
Is his own creation

3368
02:29:38,176 --> 02:29:39,456
But Alex thinks

3369
02:29:39,712 --> 02:29:40,480
The people are having

3370
02:29:40,736 --> 02:29:41,248
Fun

3371
02:29:41,504 --> 02:29:42,272
With the Hysteria

3372
02:29:42,528 --> 02:29:43,040
Like the idea

3373
02:29:43,296 --> 02:29:46,624
Beer of self isolating or that

3374
02:29:47,136 --> 02:29:47,648
Wingstop

3375
02:29:47,904 --> 02:29:48,928
Defensive driving

3376
02:29:49,184 --> 02:29:49,952
Fun with it

3377
02:29:50,464 --> 02:29:53,280
Where you can look on Twitter and see people making a lot of jokes

3378
02:29:53,536 --> 02:29:55,328
Some stuff and baby were trying to make the best of

3379
02:29:55,584 --> 02:29:56,608
A bad situation

3380
02:29:57,120 --> 02:29:59,168
But I don't think that what he's saying is

3381
02:29:59,424 --> 02:30:00,704
Is exactly true

3382
02:30:02,496 --> 02:30:04,288
And everybody gets into the Hysteria

3383
02:30:04,544 --> 02:30:06,336
Everybody has a bunch of fun with it

3384
02:30:08,640 --> 02:30:12,480
All the sudden Crossing at rush hour get there twice as fast

3385
02:30:12,736 --> 02:30:15,296
Restaurants are empty already

3386
02:30:15,808 --> 02:30:19,648
But now it'll be the new system with the new viruses weather report

3387
02:30:21,184 --> 02:30:23,488
Call this your first you will watch all this become real

3388
02:30:26,048 --> 02:30:30,400
The weather report like an allergy report

3389
02:30:32,192 --> 02:30:34,240
What

3390
02:30:34,752 --> 02:30:37,824
Allergy

3391
02:30:46,272 --> 02:30:47,296
You might notice a

3392
02:30:47,552 --> 02:30:48,832
Feeling

3393
02:30:49,088 --> 02:30:50,624
A little bit of Doom and Gloom

3394
02:30:50,880 --> 02:30:51,904
There's there's a

3395
02:30:53,952 --> 02:30:55,744
But there's a feeling of like

3396
02:30:56,256 --> 02:30:58,304
Optimistic Outlook

3397
02:30:58,560 --> 02:31:02,912
It doesn't seem that everybody's going to die all the restaurants are

3398
02:31:03,168 --> 02:31:03,936
Almost certain

3399
02:31:05,472 --> 02:31:08,544
Triggers a little bell in my mind but I was sitting and thinking I couldn't

3400
02:31:08,800 --> 02:31:12,128
Come up with it I am almost certain that I've read a short story

3401
02:31:12,384 --> 02:31:13,408
Or something

3402
02:31:13,664 --> 02:31:14,432
That involved

3403
02:31:14,944 --> 02:31:20,064
Like a virus weather report almost certain

3404
02:31:20,576 --> 02:31:23,136
I read too many things in my life I can't post

3405
02:31:23,392 --> 02:31:23,904
Specifics of a

3406
02:31:24,160 --> 02:31:24,672
I8

3407
02:31:25,184 --> 02:31:26,464
Definitely rings a bell

3408
02:31:26,720 --> 02:31:28,000
I'm almost certain that Alex is

3409
02:31:29,024 --> 02:31:30,048
Probably in Brazil

3410
02:31:32,096 --> 02:31:35,168
Alex gets to talking about the the Indian study that's

3411
02:31:35,424 --> 02:31:35,936
Retracted

3412
02:31:36,192 --> 02:31:38,752
And he's just ends up just making s*** up about that

3413
02:31:39,776 --> 02:31:41,568
Can I put out a man-made virus

3414
02:31:42,592 --> 02:31:44,640
Shut up the German and the

3415
02:31:46,432 --> 02:31:50,528
Russian and the Indian University the scanning the other six man-made

3416
02:31:55,392 --> 02:31:56,160
They just pulled it

3417
02:31:56,672 --> 02:32:00,000
So there's literally no evidence nor suggestion of evidence of the authors

3418
02:32:00,256 --> 02:32:03,840
Where's that Indian paper about the Coronavirus

3419
02:32:04,096 --> 02:32:04,864
Retracting to study

3420
02:32:05,376 --> 02:32:08,448
Because the paper was published before peer-review

3421
02:32:08,704 --> 02:32:09,728
Some pure started review

3422
02:32:09,984 --> 02:32:10,496
Their work

3423
02:32:10,752 --> 02:32:12,288
Was heavily criticized for being sloppy

3424
02:32:12,544 --> 02:32:13,056
Your response

3425
02:32:13,824 --> 02:32:17,408
One particularly scathing critique was made by Peking University's

3426
02:32:17,664 --> 02:32:18,176
Hey gang

3427
02:32:18,432 --> 02:32:22,528
Who commented on the papers allegation that the RNA samples mentioned

3428
02:32:22,784 --> 02:32:24,064
The paper a pieces of Art

3429
02:32:24,320 --> 02:32:25,088
Of HIV

3430
02:32:25,856 --> 02:32:27,904
Yang said that there was nothing unique about the

3431
02:32:28,160 --> 02:32:30,464
Small sample that is being said to be similar to

3432
02:32:30,720 --> 02:32:31,232
HIV

3433
02:32:31,488 --> 02:32:33,280
And if that's the only evidence of

3434
02:32:33,536 --> 02:32:34,560
Connection with HIV

3435
02:32:34,816 --> 02:32:39,936
In the same connection could be made between the coronavirus and quote fruit flies mold or even lentils

3436
02:32:40,960 --> 02:32:43,264
The paper was roundly criticized for jumping to unearned

3437
02:32:43,520 --> 02:32:45,312
Conclusions and making really baseless a sump

3438
02:32:46,080 --> 02:32:49,664
And upon receiving a criticism the author self retracted of their own well

3439
02:32:50,176 --> 02:32:52,480
His papers were not allowed to be publicly pre-picked

3440
02:32:52,736 --> 02:32:54,272
Never would have reached the second

3441
02:32:54,528 --> 02:32:55,808
Second stage of editorial oversight

3442
02:32:56,320 --> 02:32:58,368
Not because of a desire to cover up anything

3443
02:32:58,624 --> 02:32:59,904
But because the study is embarrassing

3444
02:33:00,160 --> 02:33:00,672
From a scientific

3445
02:33:01,952 --> 02:33:03,744
All the stuff about this study is just Alec

3446
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:04,512
Text making up

3447
02:33:04,768 --> 02:33:06,304
Stuff it's just his imagination

3448
02:33:06,816 --> 02:33:08,352
There aren't shadowy forces trying to say

3449
02:33:08,608 --> 02:33:09,376
Suppressed that information

3450
02:33:09,888 --> 02:33:12,448
There were just other scientists saying that the study is s***

3451
02:33:13,984 --> 02:33:14,752
Weird

3452
02:33:16,288 --> 02:33:17,312
The Narrative is more fun

3453
02:33:17,568 --> 02:33:20,896
Josiah Bell

3454
02:33:21,408 --> 02:33:22,944
Fundamental basic

3455
02:33:23,200 --> 02:33:24,480
Lack of understanding

3456
02:33:25,248 --> 02:33:26,016
About science

3457
02:33:26,784 --> 02:33:29,344
And that is combined with a

3458
02:33:29,600 --> 02:33:30,880
Rabid desire to do

3459
02:33:31,136 --> 02:33:33,440
Discredited well you won't find Science in ahead

3460
02:33:34,464 --> 02:33:37,280
That's also going to be a title of an hour

3461
02:33:37,536 --> 02:33:39,072
You won't find signs in head

3462
02:33:42,144 --> 02:33:43,424
So now it's speaker

3463
02:33:43,680 --> 02:33:44,192
Melvin

3464
02:33:44,448 --> 02:33:46,240
Trump is going along with

3465
02:33:46,752 --> 02:33:49,056
The recommendations of scientist

3466
02:33:50,080 --> 02:33:51,104
Subway

3467
02:33:51,360 --> 02:33:52,384
It maybe Nowell

3468
02:33:52,640 --> 02:33:53,664
But now that he's doing

3469
02:33:53,920 --> 02:33:54,688
Alex needs to

3470
02:33:54,944 --> 02:33:56,224
To justify why that's

3471
02:33:56,992 --> 02:33:57,504
Because Alex

3472
02:33:57,760 --> 02:33:59,040
Distill encouraging

3473
02:34:00,320 --> 02:34:02,368
So here's how he does it and I think this is

3474
02:34:02,624 --> 02:34:03,136
Real dumb

3475
02:34:03,392 --> 02:34:05,184
Trump

3476
02:34:05,440 --> 02:34:06,976
This is Kylie doing

3477
02:34:08,768 --> 02:34:14,400
It's a paradox because if he doesn't buy into the hysteria that's impossible to defeat this level

3478
02:34:14,656 --> 02:34:15,680
Stampede

3479
02:34:15,936 --> 02:34:16,960
Run

3480
02:34:17,472 --> 02:34:23,616
But instead he's running like a wildebeest running from a lion with all the other wildebeest

3481
02:34:30,272 --> 02:34:31,040
That's what you got

3482
02:34:40,512 --> 02:34:41,536
It's not bragging

3483
02:34:41,792 --> 02:34:42,304
Okay

3484
02:34:42,816 --> 02:34:44,864
I don't know that doesn't make a whole lot of sense wow

3485
02:34:45,120 --> 02:34:48,448
So you're noble leader is running with wildebeest

3486
02:34:48,704 --> 02:34:50,240
I can't do anything

3487
02:34:51,264 --> 02:34:53,056
The fear of being run over by the other

3488
02:34:53,824 --> 02:34:54,336
Whatever man

3489
02:34:54,592 --> 02:34:59,200
I've been wanting to leader it is somebody who will blend into a crowd of other

3490
02:34:59,968 --> 02:35:02,528
That is the goal of a leader

3491
02:35:03,040 --> 02:35:04,576
Sorensen's bunch of Gaston this

3492
02:35:04,832 --> 02:35:05,344
Episode.

3493
02:35:05,600 --> 02:35:06,112
Decided to camp

3494
02:35:06,624 --> 02:35:07,136
The mall

3495
02:35:07,648 --> 02:35:10,720
I had several guest scheduled and they're great people but I cancelled them

3496
02:35:10,976 --> 02:35:11,744
No disrespect

3497
02:35:12,512 --> 02:35:13,792
Because I want to talk

3498
02:35:14,048 --> 02:35:14,560
To the oracle

3499
02:35:16,352 --> 02:35:17,376
Meet people

3500
02:35:17,888 --> 02:35:19,936
So he's going to take calls to take calls

3501
02:35:20,448 --> 02:35:20,960
Maybe

3502
02:35:21,472 --> 02:35:22,240
Alex's

3503
02:35:22,496 --> 02:35:24,544
Rhino declared that this is Airborne HIV

3504
02:35:25,312 --> 02:35:27,872
And he elaborates on this little bit

3505
02:35:28,128 --> 02:35:30,176
More or less where this episode takes

3506
02:35:30,688 --> 02:35:31,712
A real heart

3507
02:35:31,968 --> 02:35:32,480
Downturn

3508
02:35:32,992 --> 02:35:35,296
That vibe that we had of Doom and Gloom

3509
02:35:35,552 --> 02:35:37,600
Fatalism earlier is going

3510
02:35:38,624 --> 02:35:41,184
Taking up to a level

3511
02:35:45,536 --> 02:35:46,048
Born

3512
02:35:46,816 --> 02:35:48,352
2.0 Hy-Vee

3513
02:35:48,864 --> 02:35:50,144
Nobody

3514
02:35:50,400 --> 02:35:51,168
Everybody's already got

3515
02:35:53,472 --> 02:35:58,592
Six months from now when the kids are everywhere that's what Trump knows why

3516
02:35:58,848 --> 02:36:00,128
Dabbing

3517
02:36:00,896 --> 02:36:01,408
What

3518
02:36:01,920 --> 02:36:05,248
Everybody

3519
02:36:11,136 --> 02:36:12,928
Everyone's going to get this

3520
02:36:13,184 --> 02:36:18,048
You could go hide out in a basement somewhere you're not getting away from it because once it gets in the body

3521
02:36:18,304 --> 02:36:19,584
The human body

3522
02:36:19,840 --> 02:36:22,656
Virus

3523
02:36:24,192 --> 02:36:26,496
Last days even in the sunshine

3524
02:36:27,776 --> 02:36:30,080
And it's coming for you

3525
02:36:30,336 --> 02:36:32,384
Coming for you

3526
02:36:32,640 --> 02:36:38,784
This is

3527
02:36:39,040 --> 02:36:40,832
Funny if you went all doom and gloom

3528
02:36:41,344 --> 02:36:44,416
We are going

3529
02:36:44,672 --> 02:36:45,696
Jesus Soto

3530
02:36:45,952 --> 02:36:46,464
Panic.

3531
02:36:46,976 --> 02:36:50,304
Val Trump has been holding off on the kids

3532
02:36:50,560 --> 02:36:53,120
And I understand why and this is an

3533
02:36:53,376 --> 02:36:55,424
Anything for a human being to say out loud

3534
02:36:58,496 --> 02:36:59,264
Okay so Trump

3535
02:36:59,520 --> 02:37:02,848
Covering this up because he knows that a bedroom

3536
02:37:03,104 --> 02:37:03,872
90% of 3

3537
02:37:04,128 --> 02:37:05,152
So rather than

3538
02:37:05,408 --> 02:37:06,688
Do anything now

3539
02:37:06,944 --> 02:37:08,224
Even wait until everybody has it

3540
02:37:08,480 --> 02:37:09,504
And then we'll release

3541
02:37:10,016 --> 02:37:11,296
Alexandra think that's better

3542
02:37:11,552 --> 02:37:12,832
I don't know look

3543
02:37:13,344 --> 02:37:14,112
But also

3544
02:37:15,904 --> 02:37:17,440
He doesn't want you to panic

3545
02:37:17,696 --> 02:37:23,840
Watch Star Trek

3546
02:37:25,376 --> 02:37:26,912
Your Consciousness is being drained

3547
02:37:27,168 --> 02:37:28,704
Globalist are destroying our

3548
02:37:34,592 --> 02:37:35,104
Okay

3549
02:37:35,360 --> 02:37:38,176
Okay buddy

3550
02:37:38,432 --> 02:37:40,736
Respond

3551
02:37:42,784 --> 02:37:44,576
Stop it

3552
02:37:50,208 --> 02:37:51,488
Dead already

3553
02:37:52,512 --> 02:37:58,656
Already

3554
02:37:59,936 --> 02:38:01,984
Grow up man

3555
02:38:02,240 --> 02:38:05,824
Already

3556
02:38:06,080 --> 02:38:11,968
Eclipse started with there's no reason to panic as you multiple times you're dead already

3557
02:38:12,224 --> 02:38:12,736
Sancerre

3558
02:38:12,992 --> 02:38:14,016
We're going to have to

3559
02:38:14,784 --> 02:38:17,088
I know I know I know I know your

3560
02:38:17,344 --> 02:38:18,624
Yes we are all dead already

3561
02:38:18,880 --> 02:38:19,904
I get you most of all

3562
02:38:20,160 --> 02:38:21,184
We're going to need you to

3563
02:38:21,696 --> 02:38:22,208
Wow

3564
02:38:22,464 --> 02:38:25,792
I'm not going anywhere do all this cuz they're not going to do it

3565
02:38:26,304 --> 02:38:27,840
They're going to kill you

3566
02:38:28,096 --> 02:38:28,608
Please

3567
02:38:28,864 --> 02:38:30,656
And most of us are already did

3568
02:38:31,168 --> 02:38:33,728
We'll all be sterile

3569
02:38:33,984 --> 02:38:34,496
It's over

3570
02:38:36,032 --> 02:38:38,336
But what matters is getting your spirit

3571
02:38:38,592 --> 02:38:39,360
Right with God

3572
02:38:39,872 --> 02:38:42,432
There is a very serious toenail ship

3573
02:38:42,688 --> 02:38:43,968
Is it Friday

3574
02:38:44,224 --> 02:38:47,552
Where Alex is deep in the place up to me

3575
02:38:47,808 --> 02:38:49,088
He's dead already

3576
02:38:49,600 --> 02:38:51,648
If you listen to show regularly like you can

3577
02:38:51,904 --> 02:38:54,976
Alex is in a very low place the beginning of the show

3578
02:38:55,744 --> 02:38:56,768
He's a gigantic narcissist

3579
02:38:57,024 --> 02:38:57,536
So I

3580
02:38:57,792 --> 02:39:00,096
Can't help but think that this had something to do with his personal issue

3581
02:39:00,864 --> 02:39:04,448
In the Fallout of his BWI is ex-wife is appealing for custody of

3582
02:39:04,704 --> 02:39:06,752
The children and a judge appears to be receptive

3583
02:39:07,520 --> 02:39:08,800
As a consequence of this petition

3584
02:39:09,056 --> 02:39:11,360
Arguing that Alex's home is unsafe for children

3585
02:39:11,616 --> 02:39:12,384
It also came up

3586
02:39:12,640 --> 02:39:15,456
Alex's current wife was arrested for DWI in August

3587
02:39:15,968 --> 02:39:19,040
Any arrest involved a private investigator that Alex heads

3588
02:39:19,296 --> 02:39:19,808
Following her

3589
02:39:20,064 --> 02:39:20,832
Calling the police

3590
02:39:21,088 --> 02:39:26,464
Information about his life

3591
02:39:26,720 --> 02:39:27,488
Paint them in a really

3592
02:39:27,744 --> 02:39:28,512
F*****-up light

3593
02:39:28,768 --> 02:39:31,072
Is coming to the surface including the you know

3594
02:39:31,584 --> 02:39:33,632
The fact that his dwy was the

3595
02:39:33,888 --> 02:39:36,448
It was the result of his wife calling the police

3596
02:39:36,704 --> 02:39:37,472
After a domestic

3597
02:39:37,728 --> 02:39:38,752
Incident between the two of us

3598
02:39:39,264 --> 02:39:41,568
Like these things are really pretty f***** up

3599
02:39:41,824 --> 02:39:42,848
Any probably is

3600
02:39:43,104 --> 02:39:43,616
Really worried

3601
02:39:43,872 --> 02:39:44,640
About the consequences

3602
02:39:44,896 --> 02:39:45,920
Isn't that I don't

3603
02:39:46,176 --> 02:39:47,200
Pretend to be a

3604
02:39:49,248 --> 02:39:50,272
You're calling a private

3605
02:39:52,064 --> 02:39:53,856
Probably time to

3606
02:39:54,112 --> 02:39:58,720
You're having one follow that would be time to like maybe it's not

3607
02:39:58,976 --> 02:39:59,488
A turkey

3608
02:39:59,744 --> 02:40:02,816
Kind of I don't know about that kind of just straight-up

3609
02:40:04,864 --> 02:40:06,400
Absolutely I'm hiring someone to

3610
02:40:06,656 --> 02:40:09,728
Spy on you because I love you so much it's not it's

3611
02:40:09,984 --> 02:40:10,752
It doesn't work

3612
02:40:11,008 --> 02:40:12,288
It does not pretend

3613
02:40:13,056 --> 02:40:16,384
Simultaneously Alex initially responded with Brash defiance

3614
02:40:16,640 --> 02:40:18,176
About the media covering him

3615
02:40:18,432 --> 02:40:19,712
With the silver sale

3616
02:40:22,272 --> 02:40:23,040
By Friday

3617
02:40:23,296 --> 02:40:25,856
The New York attorney general had sent him that letter

3618
02:40:26,112 --> 02:40:29,952
It's pretty clear this was not a problem you was going to be able to yell his way out of

3619
02:40:30,464 --> 02:40:34,304
The fact that he got on Aaron he continued to sell his silver on ethically.

3620
02:40:34,560 --> 02:40:35,840
Defensive about it on the 12th

3621
02:40:38,400 --> 02:40:40,704
That's a bad sign

3622
02:40:41,728 --> 02:40:42,752
We're not dead already

3623
02:40:43,264 --> 02:40:45,056
But the consequences of Alex's actions

3624
02:40:45,312 --> 02:40:46,592
Are catching up to him in a way that

3625
02:40:46,848 --> 02:40:48,128
He probably can't undo

3626
02:40:48,640 --> 02:40:52,992
When he says it's already too late most of us are already dead that sounds to me like

3627
02:40:53,248 --> 02:40:55,552
I'm trying to express that he feels like his ship has sailed

3628
02:40:56,064 --> 02:41:01,696
The New York attorney general isn't going to hear him do his blustery defiant speeches and then say oh I guess Alex was right

3629
02:41:02,464 --> 02:41:05,024
IDW I may not cause any direct consequences in

3630
02:41:05,280 --> 02:41:06,304
His life but it's looking like it

3631
02:41:07,072 --> 02:41:09,376
Probably cause some serious situations for him indirect

3632
02:41:10,144 --> 02:41:11,424
And neither of those things are things

3633
02:41:11,680 --> 02:41:12,704
He can do anything about

3634
02:41:13,472 --> 02:41:15,520
Automatic Farkle level those are the viruses

3635
02:41:15,776 --> 02:41:16,544
He's given himself

3636
02:41:18,080 --> 02:41:18,592
Yep

3637
02:41:19,104 --> 02:41:20,384
Not good and you can feel it

3638
02:41:20,640 --> 02:41:22,176
The deep deep

3639
02:41:22,432 --> 02:41:25,504
Yeah and I think that it has to do with

3640
02:41:26,016 --> 02:41:28,064
The fact that he has to go get

3641
02:41:28,320 --> 02:41:29,344
Alcohol and drug test

3642
02:41:29,856 --> 02:41:31,392
Because of the custody situation

3643
02:41:31,904 --> 02:41:33,440
And the fact that he's gotten this letter

3644
02:41:33,696 --> 02:41:35,488
From New York to General by Friday

3645
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:36,768
It's just

3646
02:41:37,536 --> 02:41:38,304
His mood is

3647
02:41:38,560 --> 02:41:39,072
So

3648
02:41:39,840 --> 02:41:41,376
We're dead already

3649
02:41:41,632 --> 02:41:44,704
That is such Why cult leaders are so dangerous what the

3650
02:41:44,960 --> 02:41:47,776
Circling it on and they're like well we're all dead anyways

3651
02:41:48,032 --> 02:41:49,312
Who wants to get on the f******

3652
02:41:49,568 --> 02:41:50,080
Can spaceship

3653
02:41:50,336 --> 02:41:51,872
Let's go

3654
02:41:52,640 --> 02:41:54,432
So Alex believes that

3655
02:41:54,688 --> 02:41:56,480
The coronavirus is not only

3656
02:41:57,248 --> 02:41:58,528
All the stuff he says

3657
02:41:58,784 --> 02:41:59,296
Already

3658
02:41:59,552 --> 02:42:01,600
Attempt to kill Trump

3659
02:42:02,112 --> 02:42:04,416
And another guy whose name began pronounce

3660
02:42:04,672 --> 02:42:07,488
I'm going to lay out the evidence that they are

3661
02:42:08,256 --> 02:42:14,400
Me. I heard this weeks ago from proposing office and ignores intensified three days ago they were sick

3662
02:42:16,448 --> 02:42:19,776
Trump's got it at nnnn baldasaro

3663
02:42:20,032 --> 02:42:21,568
Burlington

3664
02:42:21,824 --> 02:42:22,848
Is it

3665
02:42:23,872 --> 02:42:25,152
I'm sure.

3666
02:42:25,408 --> 02:42:28,224
One of the worst thing is the bubbles can do they do

3667
02:42:28,736 --> 02:42:31,040
All right so it's finally accepted

3668
02:42:32,320 --> 02:42:33,088
Alex

3669
02:42:33,856 --> 02:42:34,624
Did something I didn't do

3670
02:42:34,880 --> 02:42:35,904
Expect on this episode

3671
02:42:36,160 --> 02:42:36,672
And that is

3672
02:42:36,928 --> 02:42:39,232
He directly addresses the fact that the New York

3673
02:42:39,488 --> 02:42:43,840
Attorney general has sent to me season 2

3674
02:42:44,096 --> 02:42:45,120
Head on baby

3675
02:42:45,376 --> 02:42:45,888
This

3676
02:42:46,400 --> 02:42:48,704
Might not be

3677
02:42:49,216 --> 02:42:51,520
And I'm going to show TV viewers that with an overhead shot

3678
02:42:52,032 --> 02:42:53,824
Headed to New York AG

3679
02:42:55,872 --> 02:42:56,896
Open it up

3680
02:42:57,920 --> 02:43:04,064
Just look at all those arguments as part of them hundreds of articles

3681
02:43:05,600 --> 02:43:07,136
What happened

3682
02:43:08,160 --> 02:43:12,512
New York attorney general who is not a fan of trump though she is a lovely lady

3683
02:43:13,024 --> 02:43:16,608
I don't know yet why you stopped selling and marketing products

3684
02:43:16,864 --> 02:43:19,424
As a treatment for cheering for Coronavirus website

3685
02:43:22,240 --> 02:43:25,824
I want us to take legal action and hold him accountable for the harm he's boss

3686
02:43:27,616 --> 02:43:29,152
But she went on to make even more

3687
02:43:33,504 --> 02:43:34,272
And then I got picked

3688
02:43:38,368 --> 02:43:39,136
Actually

3689
02:43:39,392 --> 02:43:41,952
From the attorney general doesn't say any of that

3690
02:43:43,488 --> 02:43:44,512
But see they're smart

3691
02:43:47,584 --> 02:43:48,608
They put out

3692
02:43:49,632 --> 02:43:52,960
Letter a PR statement that they said was her statement

3693
02:43:54,240 --> 02:43:56,288
And then in very few of the releases did they play

3694
02:43:58,592 --> 02:43:59,104
Actual

3695
02:44:06,784 --> 02:44:07,552
Are we

3696
02:44:12,672 --> 02:44:17,280
There's a letter

3697
02:44:17,536 --> 02:44:20,608
I said listen that's not a letter that's a PR firm

3698
02:44:20,864 --> 02:44:22,656
The legal letter says

3699
02:44:26,752 --> 02:44:27,520
There's a letter

3700
02:44:27,776 --> 02:44:28,800
Yeah I bet Alex was

3701
02:44:29,056 --> 02:44:31,872
You know saying is a cease-and-desist letter

3702
02:44:32,128 --> 02:44:33,664
Secret seconds

3703
02:44:33,920 --> 02:44:36,224
Cool Alex talks a little bit more about that

3704
02:44:36,480 --> 02:44:36,992
In the snakes

3705
02:44:39,296 --> 02:44:40,576
Isn't it about the process

3706
02:44:41,344 --> 02:44:42,112
What was with

3707
02:44:42,368 --> 02:44:43,392
To lawyer this morning

3708
02:44:47,744 --> 02:44:49,280
Sounds like you were getting mad

3709
02:44:49,792 --> 02:44:53,888
There's another official letter of letterhead it just run up the email letter

3710
02:44:54,144 --> 02:44:56,448
Like don't know if that's a PR letter

3711
02:44:59,264 --> 02:45:02,080
They put that out of propaganda

3712
02:45:12,064 --> 02:45:15,392
All just one-dimensional now so we see that

3713
02:45:18,208 --> 02:45:18,976
Everywhere like that

3714
02:45:19,232 --> 02:45:20,512

That's when it it's

3761
02:47:18,015 --> 02:47:18,527
Talking

3762
02:47:18,783 --> 02:47:20,063
About the Air Force website

3763

02:47:21,855 --> 02:47:22,623
Weatherford

3765
02:47:22,879 --> 02:47:24,671

3770
02:47:37,727 --> 02:47:40,287
They have on the other larger cease-and-desist

3771
02:47:40,543 --> 02:47:41,567

3774
02:47:46,175 --> 02:47:48,991
That's the actual letter that the Attorney General sent to him

3775
02:47:49,247 --> 02:47:51,807
I don't I don't understand exactly what he

3776
02:47:52,063 --> 02:47:52,831
He's trying to say

3777
02:47:53,343 --> 02:47:53,855
About

3778
02:47:54,111 --> 02:47:54,623
They're being

3779
02:47:54,879 --> 02:47:55,647
Into Secret Letters

3780
02:47:56,159 --> 02:47:58,463
This is the letter that he showed on screen

3781
02:47:58,719 --> 02:47:59,999
It's a lighter the media covering

3782
02:48:00,511 --> 02:48:01,023
I don't know

3783
02:48:01,279 --> 02:48:05,119
These two letters but he's imagining are the same letter and you could tell here in this

3784
02:48:06,143 --> 02:48:07,167
Never shed

3785
02:48:10,239 --> 02:48:11,007
Is about tooth whitener

3786
02:48:11,263 --> 02:48:13,311
Security

3787
02:48:14,591 --> 02:48:20,735
Years ago talk about a property that's what I mean they're really crappy

3788
02:48:21,247 --> 02:48:22,271
Press release

3789
02:48:28,927 --> 02:48:35,071
Disclaimer

3790
02:48:35,327 --> 02:48:41,471
Only seen the front page saying letter they drink General

3791
02:48:41,983 --> 02:48:42,495
Think about it

3792
02:48:42,751 --> 02:48:43,775
Sovereign citizen

3793
02:48:44,031 --> 02:48:44,799
Sentai bulshit here

3794
02:48:45,055 --> 02:48:46,335
Know what he's done is

3795
02:48:46,591 --> 02:48:47,615
You taking the footnote

3796
02:48:48,895 --> 02:48:52,479
The font isn't big enough on your disclaimer and pretended that that's

3797
02:48:52,991 --> 02:48:53,503
Entire butter

3798
02:48:53,759 --> 02:48:58,367
Excellent letter is very clear that you're making misleading statements

3799
02:48:59,135 --> 02:48:59,903
So Alex

3800
02:49:00,159 --> 02:49:01,951
Good luck I mean I know you I know we can

3801
02:49:02,207 --> 02:49:03,743
Can pick his own audience with his foot this is

3802
02:49:03,999 --> 02:49:07,327
Like if the New York attorney general follows through with this

3803
02:49:07,583 --> 02:49:08,095
Business

3804
02:49:08,607 --> 02:49:09,631
Alex is a deepthroat

3805
02:49:10,143 --> 02:49:11,423
He's going to be find a lot of money

3806
02:49:11,679 --> 02:49:12,447
This is why

3807
02:49:12,703 --> 02:49:16,287
We were talking about this whenever the AG first sent the letter to Jim Bakker

3808
02:49:16,799 --> 02:49:17,311
It's just like

3809
02:49:18,335 --> 02:49:19,615
The NBA has a flagrant

3810
02:49:20,127 --> 02:49:20,895
Foul rule

3811
02:49:21,151 --> 02:49:23,455
Like this is not a you have 10 busy

3812
02:49:23,711 --> 02:49:24,479
Midstate situation

3813
02:49:24,991 --> 02:49:26,271
He's already spent two months

3814
02:49:26,783 --> 02:49:32,159
Freaking people out he didn't know about it up till that point might even be aware of the

3815
02:49:32,415 --> 02:49:37,535
Got the pattern of behavior as opposed to just this March 7th episode

3816
02:49:37,791 --> 02:49:40,607
This is a situation where it should be legit like

3817
02:49:40,863 --> 02:49:41,375
Hey

3818
02:49:41,631 --> 02:49:45,215
You f***** up I don't disagree with. I don't disagree but I don't want to tell them about their business

3819
02:49:45,471 --> 02:49:45,983
I do

3820
02:49:46,239 --> 02:49:46,751
Alright

3821
02:49:47,007 --> 02:49:49,823
You want to tell Alex to do his business I would like to do that too

3822
02:49:50,079 --> 02:49:52,639
Alex thinks that if he did do wrong

3823
02:49:53,151 --> 02:49:54,175
You should suffer Conte

3824
02:49:55,199 --> 02:50:01,087
I don't think they okay well then we're good I don't think you should suffer the same consequences for his actions

3825
02:50:01,343 --> 02:50:07,487
Can I take whatever consequences that the law

3826
02:50:07,743 --> 02:50:11,327
If I said I had a cure for Smiley's Coronavirus

3827
02:50:11,839 --> 02:50:12,607
I like

3828
02:50:15,167 --> 02:50:15,679
Stevi B's

3829
02:50:16,447 --> 02:50:18,495
Cuz I'm the one that says silver

3830
02:50:18,751 --> 02:50:19,775
It's not a silver bullet

3831
02:50:22,079 --> 02:50:22,591
I don't get it

3832
02:50:26,175 --> 02:50:28,479
Everybody knows that you think

3833
02:50:32,319 --> 02:50:33,087
What they say I did

3834
02:50:33,599 --> 02:50:37,439
See the issue is that Alex is going to really try and hang on to this I didn't say

3835
02:50:37,951 --> 02:50:38,463
Cure

3836
02:50:38,719 --> 02:50:41,279
The issue is also claims about prevent

3837
02:50:42,047 --> 02:50:43,327
So that is where he's

3838
02:50:43,583 --> 02:50:45,631
Claiming

3839
02:50:45,887 --> 02:50:47,679
To be reading the article real letter

3840
02:50:47,935 --> 02:50:49,471
You didn't read the part where it said

3841
02:50:49,727 --> 02:50:50,495
Prevention

3842
02:50:51,263 --> 02:50:51,775
Because he wants

3843
02:50:52,031 --> 02:50:53,055
He wants be perception

3844
02:50:53,311 --> 02:50:55,615
Be the ultimate he's attacking me saying I had a product

3845
02:50:55,871 --> 02:50:56,383
I said could

3846
02:50:56,639 --> 02:50:57,151
Cure it

3847
02:50:57,407 --> 02:50:59,199
Riddles about the prevention

3848
02:51:00,223 --> 02:51:02,271
So Alex tries to defend himself

3849
02:51:03,039 --> 02:51:04,831
I think he accidentally reoffend

3850
02:51:05,087 --> 02:51:06,623
While

3851
02:51:08,159 --> 02:51:09,951
My audience about real things

3852
02:51:16,607 --> 02:51:18,143
Maybe one goes in your mouth

3853
02:51:18,399 --> 02:51:20,703
You've already brush your teeth or something maybe it helped some

3854
02:51:37,087 --> 02:51:39,135
Doctors Coronavirus

3855
02:51:40,159 --> 02:51:44,255
Your honor my client said I'm speaking as myself

3856
02:51:45,535 --> 02:51:47,327
Oh well then clearly that

3857
02:51:47,583 --> 02:51:50,911
If he was he was using capital letters whenever he said

3858
02:51:51,167 --> 02:51:52,959
Now the fact that this is happening

3859
02:51:53,215 --> 02:51:56,287
After the AG sent the letter is really troubling

3860
02:51:56,543 --> 02:51:58,079
Going for allergies

3861
02:51:59,103 --> 02:52:00,383
He's just too stupid

3862
02:52:01,663 --> 02:52:02,431
Speaking stupid

3863
02:52:02,687 --> 02:52:03,711
He's just so stupid

3864
02:52:03,967 --> 02:52:05,503
This might be one of my favorite clips

3865
02:52:06,271 --> 02:52:06,783
I've ever

3866
02:52:07,551 --> 02:52:08,831
This is so funny

3867
02:52:09,087 --> 02:52:09,599
Funny

3868
02:52:09,855 --> 02:52:11,135
This is one of these clips

3869
02:52:11,391 --> 02:52:15,743
It's really like the disorganization disarray that's going on at the Inn for Studio

3870
02:52:15,999 --> 02:52:18,047
Alex trying to be super defensive but just

3871
02:52:18,303 --> 02:52:18,815
Everything

3872
02:52:19,071 --> 02:52:25,215
It's like he's trying to give like a really serious thing and then like a picture falls off the wall it's kind of a gas

3873
02:52:26,239 --> 02:52:28,799
I'm not saying the products we sell

3874
02:52:29,055 --> 02:52:32,895
Been selling for years

3875
02:52:37,759 --> 02:52:43,135
And watch these people do this cuz they took some clip out of context where I'm reading

3876
02:52:54,399 --> 02:52:57,215
Atlanta South

3877
02:53:10,271 --> 02:53:13,087
Cousin van around here

3878
02:53:15,391 --> 02:53:18,463
Here is the document

3879
02:53:18,975 --> 02:53:21,535
Hey Nikki.

3880
02:53:22,559 --> 02:53:24,607
The history of medical use

3881
02:53:25,887 --> 02:53:26,399
Sure

3882
02:53:26,655 --> 02:53:31,007
That's a big university report on it all the way

3883
02:53:32,543 --> 02:53:33,823
All bad

3884
02:53:35,103 --> 02:53:37,151
Car horn

3885
02:53:38,175 --> 02:53:41,247
They look professional operation

3886
02:53:42,527 --> 02:53:44,575
I never heard anything like that other snow

3887
02:53:45,087 --> 02:53:46,367
So weird

3888
02:53:49,439 --> 02:53:50,975
So great

3889
02:53:51,231 --> 02:53:51,743
So great

3890
02:53:51,999 --> 02:53:54,047
So that's weird that was really fun

3891
02:53:55,583 --> 02:53:56,863
Can you talk about there at the end

3892
02:53:58,911 --> 02:53:59,679
That's not a study

3893
02:53:59,935 --> 02:54:00,959
That's a review of literature

3894
02:54:01,727 --> 02:54:04,031
It was published in the Journal of surgical impacted

3895
02:54:05,567 --> 02:54:06,847
Sorry there's a car

3896
02:54:07,359 --> 02:54:08,639
Is published back in 2009

3897
02:54:09,151 --> 02:54:11,455
The conclusion of that paper is that in ancient

3898
02:54:11,711 --> 02:54:14,271
Time silver had a lot of important antimicrobial function

3899
02:54:14,527 --> 02:54:16,319
But it wasn't really all that important

3900
02:54:16,575 --> 02:54:17,087
A weed

3901
02:54:17,343 --> 02:54:18,111
Got antibiotic

3902
02:54:18,367 --> 02:54:19,903
Figured that out

3903
02:54:20,159 --> 02:54:20,927
That study

3904
02:54:21,183 --> 02:54:21,695
And paper

3905
02:54:21,951 --> 02:54:22,975
In no way justifies out

3906
02:54:24,255 --> 02:54:29,119
It's not a clinical trial of the efficacy of silver as it relates to the prevention or cure any condition

3907
02:54:29,375 --> 02:54:29,887
It's a literature

3908
02:54:30,655 --> 02:54:32,959
If this is the best he's got he's straight.

3909
02:54:33,983 --> 02:54:40,127
Also super weirdly that whole stretch there when he's talking about his teeth being kicked in and when he accidentally sells

3910
02:54:40,383 --> 02:54:45,759
Closest toothpaste as a prevention the car horns going off

3911
02:54:46,271 --> 02:54:46,783
You know what

3912
02:54:47,551 --> 02:54:52,159
All that stuff was cut from the episode that was supposed to be banned. Video

3913
02:54:55,743 --> 02:54:57,791
I've seen that happen

3914
02:54:58,047 --> 02:54:59,839
10 minutes of the episode

3915
02:55:01,631 --> 02:55:03,167
Another weirdo so I noticed

3916
02:55:03,423 --> 02:55:08,031
Because I was going back and trying to find the video of Alex like having car

3917
02:55:08,287 --> 02:55:10,591
Because it's so good one thing I noticed is that the

3918
02:55:10,847 --> 02:55:12,639
Intro Bumper Music that he uses

3919
02:55:12,895 --> 02:55:15,711
A lot of the time isn't in the version that he puts

3920
02:55:15,967 --> 02:55:16,479
Sony's website

3921
02:55:16,991 --> 02:55:22,111
I suspect himself doesn't have the rights to use those

3922
02:55:22,623 --> 02:55:23,391
Communications Network

3923
02:55:23,647 --> 02:55:28,255
Had we can't play some of those songs without violating copyright streamsrus

3924
02:55:28,511 --> 02:55:29,791
Just wild wild stuff

3925
02:55:30,047 --> 02:55:31,839
In the car warranty like you running

3926
02:55:32,095 --> 02:55:34,399
This place is held together with duct tape what are you doing

3927
02:55:35,167 --> 02:55:35,935
That's 280

3928
02:55:36,447 --> 02:55:37,983
If there's a car horn outside

3929
02:55:38,239 --> 02:55:38,751
Power window

3930
02:55:40,287 --> 02:55:40,799
Fine

3931
02:55:41,055 --> 02:55:43,103
We're not a professional f******

3932
02:55:43,615 --> 02:55:44,127
Studio

3933
02:55:45,407 --> 02:55:46,943
So the car horns are hilarious

3934
02:55:47,455 --> 02:55:49,759
I think it's really funny

3935
02:55:50,015 --> 02:55:51,039
Is that maybe the best

3936
02:55:51,295 --> 02:55:51,807
That's the best

3937
02:55:53,343 --> 02:55:53,855
He couldn't stop

3938
02:55:54,111 --> 02:55:57,439
He was mad that you couldn't write that

3939
02:55:57,695 --> 02:55:58,463
So that's funny

3940
02:55:59,487 --> 02:56:02,047
But unfortunately they also had another unfortunate

3941
02:56:02,303 --> 02:56:03,327
They made it more depressed

3942
02:56:03,583 --> 02:56:09,727
I tried to take off about a month ago for first vacation in about a year and I'm not complaining

3943
02:56:09,983 --> 02:56:11,263
I need a vacation

3944
02:56:12,031 --> 02:56:15,615
Take off next week

3945
02:56:16,383 --> 02:56:22,527
Horns on the whole time so I'm saying that's it the way latest

3946
02:56:22,783 --> 02:56:24,831
5 minutes

3947
02:56:25,087 --> 02:56:26,879
Broadcast

3948
02:56:30,719 --> 02:56:31,487
Your phone calls now

3949
02:56:31,999 --> 02:56:32,767
So he is

3950
02:56:33,791 --> 02:56:39,935
Car horns have convinced him that this place can't run without account

3951
02:56:40,191 --> 02:56:44,287
Yeah yeah it's obviously cuz everybody else's incompetent Dan

3952
02:56:44,543 --> 02:56:46,335
Everyone else but

3953
02:56:46,591 --> 02:56:48,383
Bees bad at their job

3954
02:56:48,895 --> 02:56:50,687
God if I was a color I was just calling

3955
02:56:51,455 --> 02:56:53,503
Just turn my car horn absolutely

3956
02:56:54,527 --> 02:56:55,807
Well

3957
02:56:56,063 --> 02:56:56,575
Alex's

3958
02:56:57,087 --> 02:56:57,599
Pissed

3959
02:56:58,111 --> 02:56:59,647
Like I don't know if it's the car horns

3960
02:57:00,927 --> 02:57:03,231
New York AG sending in that letter

3961
02:57:05,023 --> 02:57:05,535
Not

3962
02:57:05,791 --> 02:57:07,839
Like he's not in the kind of mood you

3963
02:57:08,095 --> 02:57:09,631
You'd want to talk to him on the phone

3964
02:57:09,887 --> 02:57:11,423
Taking it you can hear my

3965
02:57:11,935 --> 02:57:13,215
Audio correct

3966
02:57:30,111 --> 02:57:31,391

That's not

3970
02:57:39,583 --> 02:57:41,119
Good you got no time

3971
02:57:42,143 --> 02:57:44,447
Say what you want to say dumb dumb in let's go

3972

So call her

3973
02:57:46,495 --> 02:57:48,543
Suggest that you know the kids are going to be out of school

3974
02:57:48,799 --> 02:57:49,567
Because the schools are closed

3975
02:57:51,103 --> 02:57:51,615
Curfew

3976
02:57:52,383 --> 02:57:53,663
Although this called does not go well

3977
02:57:54,175 --> 02:57:55,967
Believer

3978
02:57:56,223 --> 02:57:56,991
Releasing

3979
02:57:57,247 --> 02:57:58,015
School

3980
02:58:01,599 --> 02:58:02,111
Don't come up with

3981
02:58:02,623 --> 02:58:03,391
We don't want them to get

3982
02:58:10,559 --> 02:58:12,095
What do you think coming next

3983
02:58:13,375 --> 02:58:13,887
Confuse

3984
02:58:15,935 --> 02:58:16,447
Cool

3985
02:58:18,751 --> 02:58:19,263
This is

3986
02:58:19,519 --> 02:58:20,287
Wow

3987
02:58:20,799 --> 02:58:23,615
Alex's check

3988
02:58:23,871 --> 02:58:27,711
Not playing usn

3989
02:58:27,967 --> 02:58:28,479
Curfews

3990
02:58:31,295 --> 02:58:32,575
You got to bring something hot

3991
02:58:33,087 --> 02:58:37,183
Going to come today so another caller calls in and talks about a narrative that Alex

3992
02:58:37,439 --> 02:58:38,207
I already put out

3993
02:58:38,463 --> 02:58:43,839
A while back there was a job posting on jobs.gov or whatever

3994
02:58:44,095 --> 02:58:45,375
In November.

3995
02:58:45,887 --> 02:58:46,399
Beersy

3996
02:58:46,911 --> 02:58:49,983
Alex. Seems like yeah that's right that's right

3997
02:58:50,239 --> 02:58:51,775
Get off the phone with him and he is f******

3998
02:58:52,287 --> 02:58:54,591
Pissed off that you'd forgotten about that narrative

3999
02:58:57,919 --> 02:58:59,199
PS3

4000
02:59:02,015 --> 02:59:04,063
I want to get to all of you I want to shut up

4001
02:59:05,087 --> 02:59:06,623
I want to get to you but then I got like

4002
02:59:08,159 --> 02:59:10,207
Say that again

4003
02:59:10,463 --> 02:59:11,743
Can I wake you up early

4004
02:59:19,935 --> 02:59:25,311
Got you I'm just on here

4005
02:59:46,303 --> 02:59:52,447
I'm going to get myself in the face

4006
02:59:56,031 --> 03:00:01,407
Really

4007
03:00:02,687 --> 03:00:03,455
Man-made

4008
03:00:04,479 --> 03:00:08,575
He doesn't get the right amount of calls

4009
03:00:09,855 --> 03:00:13,183
Not under any stress

4010
03:00:13,439 --> 03:00:19,583
At all that you know he can't get the calls at all to raise the stakes you know you're not

4011
03:00:20,863 --> 03:00:21,375
What about

4012
03:00:21,631 --> 03:00:23,423
It's not enough

4013
03:00:23,679 --> 03:00:25,727
But he says he's a bunch of Self in the face

4014
03:00:25,983 --> 03:00:27,775
He has to make it even more

4015
03:00:28,287 --> 03:00:29,311
Do any cozy

4016
03:00:30,335 --> 03:00:30,847
That's like

4017
03:00:31,359 --> 03:00:32,639
Intermediate

4018
03:00:33,151 --> 03:00:34,687
Recalls in the segment

4019
03:00:34,943 --> 03:00:36,991
Just walk off the show

4020
03:00:37,503 --> 03:00:38,527
My fault don't get it done

4021
03:00:38,783 --> 03:00:40,319
Walk off the show

4022
03:00:40,575 --> 03:00:42,367
How many Costco

4023
03:00:46,463 --> 03:00:52,607
Why would a Kenwood WWII one call and then he has an

4024
03:00:52,863 --> 03:00:53,887
An emergency

4025
03:00:54,143 --> 03:00:55,423
Interview with France

4026
03:00:55,679 --> 03:00:56,447
Boil

4027
03:00:56,703 --> 03:01:02,847
An emergency interview with Francis Boyle is a sentence that nobody has ever see how he doesn't end up

4028
03:01:05,663 --> 03:01:06,943
Did you punch yourself in the face

4029
03:01:07,967 --> 03:01:10,527
Maybe metaphorically though because he does

4030
03:01:11,039 --> 03:01:12,319
Keep selling his solo

4031
03:01:15,647 --> 03:01:18,975
Don't want to tell you what nanosilver coil silver does fog

4032
03:01:19,487 --> 03:01:20,511
The studies don't

4033
03:01:20,767 --> 03:01:22,815
Don't buy my products

4034
03:01:24,351 --> 03:01:26,911
Go look at house nanosilver

4035
03:01:27,167 --> 03:01:27,679
Hotels

4036
03:01:28,447 --> 03:01:30,239
And how God knows viruses

4037
03:01:30,495 --> 03:01:31,007
No

4038
03:01:32,031 --> 03:01:35,615
You idiot the viruses and stuff too but you're unreal

4039
03:01:36,127 --> 03:01:38,687
It's like The Sylvers like no cells my

4040
03:01:39,199 --> 03:01:42,015
So I don't think a defense in court is going to be

4041
03:01:42,271 --> 03:01:45,599
I practiced it by saying don't by myself

4042
03:01:46,111 --> 03:01:47,135
That works

4043
03:01:48,671 --> 03:01:50,207
Precious they're just too dumb

4044
03:01:50,463 --> 03:01:51,743
How do we let fastest win

4045
03:01:52,511 --> 03:01:53,279
Every time there's a

4046
03:01:53,535 --> 03:01:54,559
So goddamn stupid

4047
03:01:54,815 --> 03:01:55,327
Depth

4048
03:01:55,583 --> 03:01:56,607
So Alex

4049
03:01:57,119 --> 03:01:59,167
Has Francis Boyle on and who cares

4050
03:01:59,423 --> 03:01:59,935
It's all the same

4051
03:02:00,447 --> 03:02:03,263
It's all it's all the same

4052
03:02:03,775 --> 03:02:04,799
There's one thing

4053
03:02:05,055 --> 03:02:05,567
It happened

4054
03:02:05,823 --> 03:02:10,943
It's interesting and that Alex has a new claim about why there's everyone ever on the covering

4055
03:02:11,199 --> 03:02:12,991
Is DWI and silver shed

4056
03:02:13,503 --> 03:02:15,295
You know obviously it's CIA machina

4057
03:02:15,551 --> 03:02:19,647
Actually but it gets only First Step but how it's actually has like

4058
03:02:20,159 --> 03:02:20,671
Reeling

4059
03:02:21,439 --> 03:02:26,815
Sure

4060
03:02:27,071 --> 03:02:29,887
But just having you and others on pissed them off

4061
03:02:30,143 --> 03:02:34,751
So somebody inside the CDC but the word out to try to shut us down I'm sure you've seen the news

4062
03:02:35,007 --> 03:02:37,823
Everywhere the converse

4063
03:02:38,079 --> 03:02:38,591
Doctor

4064
03:02:40,127 --> 03:02:41,663
That would not surprise me

4065
03:02:41,919 --> 03:02:47,295
So Alex is at Francis Boyle and Mike Adams on Cheeseheads

4066
03:02:47,807 --> 03:02:49,855
On for years and the EVPs

4067
03:02:50,111 --> 03:02:51,903
The last time there was an outbreak

4068
03:02:52,927 --> 03:02:56,511
Francis Boyle was on calling it a bio-weapon all this stuff is

4069
03:02:56,767 --> 03:03:00,351
Exactly sure happened this time that didn't happen last time

4070
03:03:01,119 --> 03:03:01,887
Twi

4071
03:03:02,143 --> 03:03:03,679
I was selling a silver this way

4072
03:03:04,703 --> 03:03:06,239
Maybe that's the variable

4073
03:03:06,495 --> 03:03:12,639
But no he's confirmed with lawyers that someone at the CDC got mad at him and so they're doing all this to him

4074
03:03:12,895 --> 03:03:15,455
DCS lawyers Alex has lawyers

4075
03:03:15,711 --> 03:03:18,015
Together they all Chad gossip and then

4076
03:03:18,271 --> 03:03:19,807
That's how you get all that information

4077
03:03:20,063 --> 03:03:20,831
Everybody knows

4078
03:03:21,087 --> 03:03:23,391
So Alex talked about how the coronavirus attacks

4079
03:03:23,647 --> 03:03:29,791
The testicles like this is about

4080
03:03:30,047 --> 03:03:31,327
It's not pure review yet

4081
03:03:31,583 --> 03:03:32,607
It's still preliminary

4082
03:03:32,863 --> 03:03:33,375
Anymore work

4083
03:03:33,631 --> 03:03:34,399
Needs to be done on that front

4084
03:03:34,655 --> 03:03:36,191
Alex should be reporting on it

4085
03:03:36,703 --> 03:03:37,215
Sure

4086
03:03:37,727 --> 03:03:39,519
Alex Jones get to this call

4087
03:03:41,823 --> 03:03:45,663
Takes more calls later but not in the segment where you said you was going

4088
03:03:47,967 --> 03:03:54,111
He does get you a couple calls looking for

4089
03:03:54,367 --> 03:03:55,135
Okay well then where

4090
03:03:56,415 --> 03:03:56,927
This caller

4091
03:04:01,791 --> 03:04:02,559
And also

4092
03:04:02,815 --> 03:04:05,887
Why are we not seeing any of these

4093
03:04:06,143 --> 03:04:06,655
Families

4094
03:04:06,911 --> 03:04:07,679
These people that

4095
03:04:07,935 --> 03:04:08,447
Guide

4096
03:04:08,959 --> 03:04:09,727
Doing interview

4097
03:04:09,983 --> 03:04:11,519
Shooting

4098
03:04:12,287 --> 03:04:16,383
Don't worry it's a giant Tower grab the whole thing synthetic

4099
03:04:16,639 --> 03:04:17,407
Body was dead

4100
03:04:17,919 --> 03:04:18,687
Body was cold

4101
03:04:19,199 --> 03:04:23,551
Maybe privacy issues maybe they're also quarantine number of reasons

4102
03:04:25,343 --> 03:04:26,623
Brick this woman Insider

4103
03:04:27,391 --> 03:04:29,439
Just just build a wall around this woman

4104
03:04:29,695 --> 03:04:30,719
She cannot be allowed out

4105
03:04:31,743 --> 03:04:37,887
It's not something that you would be wildly suspicious about the brexit I looked into it and a number of family

4106
03:04:38,143 --> 03:04:39,935
Members of people I have spoke

4107
03:04:40,191 --> 03:04:43,775
Places like the LA Times

4108
03:04:45,055 --> 03:04:47,871
You're not finding it doesn't mean it's not happen

4109
03:04:49,407 --> 03:04:51,455
So now Alex starts thinking about

4110
03:04:52,479 --> 03:04:53,759
One of his family members

4111
03:04:54,271 --> 03:04:54,783
Getting the vibe

4112
03:04:55,295 --> 03:04:58,111
Oh no he starts thinking about how he will kill

4113
03:04:59,647 --> 03:05:01,951
Casino that's probably not the right response

4114
03:05:02,207 --> 03:05:03,743
Yeah healthy human

4115
03:05:05,023 --> 03:05:08,607
We've heard him periodically brag about stopping people

4116
03:05:08,863 --> 03:05:12,703
Go to that right and what have you he said noted murderer

4117
03:05:12,959 --> 03:05:14,239
He takes it even further

4118
03:05:14,495 --> 03:05:15,775
Mike down for this

4119
03:05:16,031 --> 03:05:17,823
Because he said something

4120
03:05:18,079 --> 03:05:21,663
And then clearly stops himself in the middle of it I think it's important

4121
03:05:22,431 --> 03:05:24,991
Something tough guy Tang

4122
03:05:26,783 --> 03:05:29,343
Killing people is like taking a crap it's so easy

4123
03:05:31,903 --> 03:05:37,279
Like it's like eating food or having sex or taking a dump and it's like Were Meant to do

4124
03:05:37,535 --> 03:05:39,071
You know

4125
03:05:41,375 --> 03:05:43,679
Long

4126
03:05:43,935 --> 03:05:44,959
It's so easy

4127
03:05:48,543 --> 03:05:51,359
Right before he says I know how to do it he says

4128
03:05:52,383 --> 03:05:53,407
He was going to say I love it

4129
03:05:53,663 --> 03:05:57,759
He was going to say I look killing you was going to say I love killing people

4130
03:05:58,271 --> 03:06:02,111
Yeah Zodiac Killer what the f*** is going on

4131
03:06:02,879 --> 03:06:06,975
Alex Jones is Dad a famous serial killer and now we're some sort of like

4132
03:06:07,231 --> 03:06:10,303
Dexter situation where you trained to serial killer from when he was

4133
03:06:10,559 --> 03:06:16,447
The child and its whole f****** radio thing or a serious murderer I don't believe him

4134
03:06:16,959 --> 03:06:17,983
But neither hisses

4135
03:06:18,239 --> 03:06:20,287
What do you want people to think about

4136
03:06:20,543 --> 03:06:21,823
Yeah he wants his audience

4137
03:06:22,079 --> 03:06:24,639
To see him as somebody who maybe likes to kill

4138
03:06:24,895 --> 03:06:28,735
It's so f***** up Paddock if you are somebody like

4139
03:06:28,991 --> 03:06:29,759
I don't know his

4140
03:06:30,015 --> 03:06:30,527
Dad

4141
03:06:30,783 --> 03:06:32,575
Like you got to do it like you keep

4142
03:06:32,831 --> 03:06:34,111
What do you do when your son is

4143
03:06:34,367 --> 03:06:40,511
Admitting to murders and saying he likes to kill people on are also by the way I can't imagine this playing

4144
03:06:40,767 --> 03:06:43,583
Well in the motion that his ex-wife is filed in court

4145
03:06:43,839 --> 03:06:45,375
Playing for the judge I liked

4146
03:06:45,631 --> 03:06:49,215
They don't allow stuff that's on the show is the character

4147
03:06:49,727 --> 03:06:50,239
F******

4148
03:06:50,495 --> 03:06:53,055
This is how a nine-year-old thinks

4149
03:06:53,311 --> 03:06:54,591
People would think about like an eye

4150
03:06:54,847 --> 03:06:56,383
Find girls who was only ever watched

4151
03:06:56,639 --> 03:06:57,151
F******

4152
03:06:57,407 --> 03:07:02,015
Action movies and murder and violence over and over and over on screen

4153
03:07:02,271 --> 03:07:03,807
This is how you behave as a man

4154
03:07:04,063 --> 03:07:05,855
A real man loves killing

4155
03:07:07,135 --> 03:07:10,719
Well the other week people can't do it and all that

4156
03:07:11,231 --> 03:07:11,743
Sure

4157
03:07:12,511 --> 03:07:13,279
Stupid

4158
03:07:13,791 --> 03:07:16,607
So Alex brags about how his people

4159
03:07:16,863 --> 03:07:21,471
We're going to kill all the global Usher and this is where Alex gets even more depressed

4160
03:07:22,239 --> 03:07:23,263
I've already won

4161
03:07:23,775 --> 03:07:24,543
My

4162
03:07:24,799 --> 03:07:25,567
People who are

4163
03:07:26,591 --> 03:07:27,359
White people

4164
03:07:27,615 --> 03:07:28,127
Quite

4165
03:07:28,639 --> 03:07:29,407
I am there people

4166
03:07:29,663 --> 03:07:31,455
Quite going to kill you

4167
03:07:35,295 --> 03:07:37,343
We know you're I know there

4168
03:07:39,391 --> 03:07:40,927
And you're not going to rest

4169
03:07:41,183 --> 03:07:42,975
Well you did this and that's all

4170
03:07:45,791 --> 03:07:48,351
I'm not going to commit suicide

4171
03:07:48,863 --> 03:07:52,703
Been working really hard man and I just salad about it all like

4172
03:07:52,959 --> 03:07:54,239
I want to keep going forever

4173
03:07:54,495 --> 03:07:55,775
I'm not scared at all

4174
03:07:57,567 --> 03:07:58,591
I want to know

4175
03:07:58,847 --> 03:07:59,871
You're going to die

4176
03:08:00,639 --> 03:08:01,919
You're going to go to hell

4177
03:08:03,455 --> 03:08:04,479
I appreciate the call Janet

4178
03:08:11,903 --> 03:08:13,183
Call boy

4179
03:08:13,439 --> 03:08:15,999
Alex is really in this headspace

4180
03:08:16,255 --> 03:08:16,767
About like

4181
03:08:17,023 --> 03:08:18,559
I've completed my mission

4182
03:08:19,071 --> 03:08:20,607
There's a fatalistic in a

4183
03:08:20,863 --> 03:08:21,375
To this

4184
03:08:22,143 --> 03:08:23,679
I don't believe any of this

4185
03:08:23,935 --> 03:08:24,447
Things he says

4186
03:08:24,959 --> 03:08:26,751
Obviously he's full of s***

4187
03:08:27,007 --> 03:08:30,591
What I hear is a way of talking about

4188
03:08:30,847 --> 03:08:33,407
The consequences that are piling down on him

4189
03:08:33,663 --> 03:08:34,687
Without being real about

4190
03:08:35,711 --> 03:08:38,015
I would imagine that it's some point

4191
03:08:38,271 --> 03:08:38,783
Alex

4192
03:08:39,295 --> 03:08:40,575
Maybe had a lawyer talk to him

4193
03:08:41,087 --> 03:08:41,599
And said

4194
03:08:42,111 --> 03:08:45,951
This letter from the New York attorney general's office

4195
03:08:46,207 --> 03:08:49,791
No

4196
03:08:50,047 --> 03:08:52,351
I think maybe someone was able to get through to him

4197
03:08:52,607 --> 03:08:53,631
That like this isn't going

4198
03:08:53,887 --> 03:08:56,191
To go away just by yelling about this letter that you got

4199
03:08:56,447 --> 03:08:57,215
From your silver supplier

4200
03:08:57,727 --> 03:08:59,519
It is not you have breached

4201
03:09:00,031 --> 03:09:01,055
AG is

4202
03:09:01,311 --> 03:09:02,335
Coming down on Rob

4203
03:09:02,591 --> 03:09:03,103
Do buddy

4204
03:09:03,359 --> 03:09:05,919
Wright Do-it going to do is going to make it out fine

4205
03:09:06,175 --> 03:09:07,199
I think

4206
03:09:07,711 --> 03:09:09,247
I think that he realizes like there

4207
03:09:09,503 --> 03:09:10,015
Lose

4208
03:09:10,783 --> 03:09:12,319
It might be some s***

4209
03:09:13,343 --> 03:09:15,135
He gets into the head space where the waiter

4210
03:09:15,647 --> 03:09:16,159
That is

4211
03:09:16,415 --> 03:09:17,695
I've completed my mission

4212
03:09:17,951 --> 03:09:18,719
I'm ready to die

4213
03:09:19,231 --> 03:09:19,743
And

4214
03:09:20,255 --> 03:09:20,767
Let's reference

4215
03:09:21,023 --> 03:09:21,535
Rock song

4216
03:09:21,791 --> 03:09:23,327
The final equation

4217
03:09:24,607 --> 03:09:26,655
Iron Maiden song The Trooper

4218
03:09:27,679 --> 03:09:28,959
And we can go out to break

4219
03:09:29,471 --> 03:09:32,031
Let's try to kill the Tripper in a minute we got to do it

4220
03:09:34,591 --> 03:09:38,175
Because you'll fire musket but I'll run you through

4221
03:09:39,711 --> 03:09:41,503
And when you're waiting for the next attack

4222
03:09:42,783 --> 03:09:43,807
Better stand

4223
03:09:44,319 --> 03:09:45,343
Falling back

4224
03:09:46,111 --> 03:09:46,879
I'm Soldier

4225
03:09:47,391 --> 03:09:47,903
If it rhymes

4226
03:09:48,159 --> 03:09:48,671
True

4227
03:09:48,927 --> 03:09:49,695
Amanda farmer

4228
03:09:53,791 --> 03:09:55,583
And they don't know how to deal with someone like that

4229
03:09:56,351 --> 03:09:57,887
I'm so ready to die

4230
03:09:58,399 --> 03:10:00,191
But I want to make sure on the way down

4231
03:10:01,983 --> 03:10:04,031
And they're so scared of that

4232
03:10:04,287 --> 03:10:07,103
They don't know what to do when somebody's ready to die

4233
03:10:07,871 --> 03:10:08,639
Tell me what to do

4234
03:10:09,151 --> 03:10:09,919
The shifter

4235
03:10:10,175 --> 03:10:11,711
All night long

4236
03:10:14,271 --> 03:10:17,343
On their knees their God the devil begging for power

4237
03:10:19,647 --> 03:10:25,791
We Empower them to defeat us they will not defeat us they will burn in hell

4238
03:10:26,559 --> 03:10:28,351
Twisted Sister song

4239
03:10:30,655 --> 03:10:31,679
Just like that

4240
03:10:36,287 --> 03:10:38,079
You're not going to get victory

4241
03:10:39,359 --> 03:10:41,919
All your money how are we stopping this like

4242
03:10:46,527 --> 03:10:47,551
You know

4243
03:10:48,575 --> 03:10:54,719
You know how 24 hours prior Alex was joking about how the ladies love that voice with Milo

4244
03:10:54,975 --> 03:10:56,511
Now that he's being deployed

4245
03:10:56,767 --> 03:10:58,303
Very differently

4246
03:10:59,071 --> 03:11:04,959
So Alex has Mike Adams come in because he can't Bulldogs Gaston and I have to

4247
03:11:05,215 --> 03:11:08,799
It's so bright comes on and it's really interesting because

4248
03:11:09,567 --> 03:11:12,639
He's advising exactly with the mainstream media advisor

4249
03:11:13,151 --> 03:11:16,223
Bottom line Alex is the only thing that stops this now

4250
03:11:16,479 --> 03:11:20,319
Is social distancing extreme shutdown

4251
03:11:21,087 --> 03:11:21,599
Going to begin

4252
03:11:22,111 --> 03:11:24,415
And folks it it's not a conspiracy to try

4253
03:11:24,671 --> 03:11:25,183
Embarrassed

4254
03:11:25,695 --> 03:11:27,999
This is literally the only medical way to stop this

4255
03:11:28,255 --> 03:11:30,303
That's the opposite of a lot of

4256
03:11:30,559 --> 03:11:31,839
Alex

4257
03:11:32,607 --> 03:11:33,631
Read it like

4258
03:11:34,655 --> 03:11:35,935
I have genuinely gotten

4259
03:11:36,191 --> 03:11:36,959
Stuck in this like

4260
03:11:37,215 --> 03:11:39,775
So much stuff doesn't seem real

4261
03:11:40,543 --> 03:11:41,823
And this broadcast

4262
03:11:42,591 --> 03:11:43,871
Fields made of

4263
03:11:44,127 --> 03:11:47,711
It feels like

4264
03:11:47,967 --> 03:11:54,111
Real Beyond I like this either dream I think I could write it better this is really a joint tomorrow

4265
03:11:54,367 --> 03:11:57,183
All over the place

4266
03:11:57,439 --> 03:12:00,767
Even the best I can do is still a bit disjointed

4267
03:12:01,023 --> 03:12:01,535
Frazee

4268
03:12:01,791 --> 03:12:03,327
Yeah this is unreal

4269
03:12:04,863 --> 03:12:06,911
So Alex and Mike are talking

4270
03:12:07,167 --> 03:12:08,191
And I think that they make it

4271
03:12:08,447 --> 03:12:10,239
I think Mike's trying to keep

4272
03:12:10,495 --> 03:12:12,031
Keep the facade up a little bit

4273
03:12:12,287 --> 03:12:14,335
Is way too overt about the fact

4274
03:12:14,847 --> 03:12:15,359
Hey look

4275
03:12:15,615 --> 03:12:17,663
We've been line matter what the cases with

4276
03:12:17,919 --> 03:12:18,431
Virus

4277
03:12:19,199 --> 03:12:19,967
Could use it

4278
03:12:20,223 --> 03:12:21,247
Close the borders

4279
03:12:21,503 --> 03:12:24,319
And do all our authoritarian s*** that we want him to do

4280
03:12:24,575 --> 03:12:26,111
Closest way to

4281
03:12:27,135 --> 03:12:30,207
He's in he's pulling himself out of the trap now

4282
03:12:32,511 --> 03:12:34,047
For the military to the southern border

4283
03:12:34,559 --> 03:12:36,863
Block the Border block all illegal traffic

4284
03:12:37,119 --> 03:12:37,631
Today

4285
03:12:37,887 --> 03:12:38,399
Right now

4286
03:12:38,655 --> 03:12:40,703
Use the crisis to fix

4287
03:12:45,055 --> 03:12:49,151
You're a criminal and fluid rugs and stuff

4288
03:12:57,855 --> 03:12:58,367
Oh

4289
03:12:58,623 --> 03:13:04,767
We forget about how many years Alex has been screaming about Rahm Emanuel saying never let a good crisis go

4290
03:13:05,023 --> 03:13:08,351
Go to waste talking about Alex evil man

4291
03:13:13,471 --> 03:13:14,239
Cuz ramazan

4292
03:13:14,751 --> 03:13:20,639
So Alex earlier said that he wasn't telling people to you know flee the cities or anyting

4293
03:13:20,895 --> 03:13:21,919
That's what he has Mike for

4294
03:13:22,175 --> 03:13:22,943
He's there

4295
03:13:23,199 --> 03:13:27,039
To give the synthesis or be the dialectic or whatever

4296
03:13:27,295 --> 03:13:28,319
Cheers Mike fulfilling

4297
03:13:28,575 --> 03:13:30,111
His role

4298
03:13:30,367 --> 03:13:31,391
You're in much better shape

4299
03:13:31,647 --> 03:13:32,671
Right now if you're in the city

4300
03:13:35,487 --> 03:13:37,535
You might want to get out while you can

4301
03:13:37,791 --> 03:13:38,303
If you can't

4302
03:13:38,815 --> 03:13:41,887
You better be prepared to hunker down and survive

4303
03:13:42,143 --> 03:13:42,655
Becoming

4304
03:13:44,703 --> 03:13:49,823
So survivors get out of the city at the zombies

4305
03:13:51,103 --> 03:13:52,127
So how does zombies

4306
03:13:53,663 --> 03:13:56,735
The Mike is still on his b******* about how this is a prelude for a

4307
03:13:56,991 --> 03:14:00,063
Chinese land invasion

4308
03:14:00,319 --> 03:14:00,831
Now

4309
03:14:01,343 --> 03:14:04,159
He has added a wrinkle to this narrative Vic

4310
03:14:04,415 --> 03:14:04,927
Coexist

4311
03:14:05,183 --> 03:14:05,951
With Alex's narrative

4312
03:14:06,719 --> 03:14:07,487
I find that very interesting

4313
03:14:07,999 --> 03:14:10,047
Are not on the same page at all

4314
03:14:11,583 --> 03:14:12,095
America

4315
03:14:12,863 --> 03:14:13,631
Does first wave

4316
03:14:13,887 --> 03:14:14,655
China

4317
03:14:14,911 --> 03:14:15,423
Allowing

4318
03:14:16,447 --> 03:14:16,959
Fractions

4319
03:14:17,215 --> 03:14:19,263
Means that they have achieved immunity for

4320
03:14:19,775 --> 03:14:22,591
Charter internet create the narrative

4321
03:14:22,847 --> 03:14:25,919
That are not bad

4322
03:14:26,431 --> 03:14:30,015
And I may have the perfect bioweapon launchpoint that's how you would do this

4323
03:14:30,527 --> 03:14:31,295
Exactly

4324
03:14:32,319 --> 03:14:34,879
They're willing to sacrifice so many of their people and then

4325
03:14:35,135 --> 03:14:35,903
Achieve immunity

4326
03:14:36,159 --> 03:14:36,671
Quickly with a

4327
03:14:36,927 --> 03:14:38,207
A Draconian lockdown means

4328
03:14:38,463 --> 03:14:42,047
Mobile military force that is immune to the virus

4329
03:14:42,559 --> 03:14:44,863
Can literally invade and survive

4330
03:14:45,375 --> 03:14:46,655
If they choose to do that

4331
03:14:46,911 --> 03:14:48,447
Because their troops won't be effective

4332
03:14:48,703 --> 03:14:49,983
By the virus there already

4333
03:14:50,239 --> 03:14:55,871
So bike seems to not be up on the narrative virus keeps coming back

4334
03:14:56,127 --> 03:14:57,663
You don't have an immunity to it

4335
03:14:57,919 --> 03:14:58,687
So

4336
03:14:58,943 --> 03:14:59,967
Kind of is a problem this is

4337
03:15:00,223 --> 03:15:01,247
Completely like

4338
03:15:01,503 --> 03:15:03,551
Incompatible

4339
03:15:06,111 --> 03:15:07,647
As long as China

4340
03:15:09,183 --> 03:15:09,695
It takes out

4341
03:15:10,207 --> 03:15:10,719
Mike Adams

4342
03:15:11,487 --> 03:15:12,511
They can they can invade

4343
03:15:13,023 --> 03:15:17,119
How do you say wrong takeout in a I'm just saying

4344
03:15:17,375 --> 03:15:18,655
You know like it before midnight

4345
03:15:18,911 --> 03:15:19,679
You know they take out

4346
03:15:19,935 --> 03:15:22,751
Strong disagree if only because I don't think that's a fair trade

4347
03:15:23,007 --> 03:15:23,775
I think it's a fair

4348
03:15:24,287 --> 03:15:25,311
I'm not sure I'll take

4349
03:15:25,823 --> 03:15:29,919
So Alex in my crap up there in a few knocks doesn't even recognize how that is

4350
03:15:30,175 --> 03:15:30,687
Completely

4351
03:15:30,943 --> 03:15:31,967
Contradictory

4352
03:15:33,503 --> 03:15:34,015
No beliefs

4353
03:15:34,271 --> 03:15:35,295
He doesn't

4354
03:15:35,551 --> 03:15:37,343
This is such a sad

4355
03:15:37,599 --> 03:15:39,135
Burpee plug

4356
03:15:40,927 --> 03:15:45,279
At the break we have the Silver Seal products we have all the right to face

4357
03:15:46,303 --> 03:15:48,607
Leonardo back in stock but it's going to sell out

4358
03:15:53,727 --> 03:15:54,495
Crazy

4359
03:15:55,263 --> 03:15:56,287
But job

4360
03:15:57,055 --> 03:15:59,359
Show on the airless right products are needed

4361
03:16:05,503 --> 03:16:07,295
Feeling right now

4362
03:16:07,551 --> 03:16:09,343
Holyshit

4363
03:16:10,367 --> 03:16:12,671
Holyshit

4364
03:16:12,927 --> 03:16:19,071
A scene where a guy like Alex meltdown this is exactly what it would look like

4365
03:16:19,327 --> 03:16:20,863
I mean you could you could

4366
03:16:21,119 --> 03:16:23,167
Interpret what Alex is saying to

4367
03:16:23,423 --> 03:16:29,567
There's the way he wants you to interpret it which is I wish I wasn't selling these products because people need them in a terrible

4368
03:16:29,823 --> 03:16:31,615
Situation in there buying them that means

4369
03:16:31,871 --> 03:16:32,639
Stupid situations Tarot

4370
03:16:32,895 --> 03:16:33,407
Yeah that's

4371
03:16:33,663 --> 03:16:34,687
The most generous reading

4372
03:16:34,943 --> 03:16:35,455
King of that

4373
03:16:35,967 --> 03:16:36,479
Reality

4374
03:16:37,503 --> 03:16:41,599
Me probably feels a certain amount of guilt yet about knowing that is silver is going to do s***

4375
03:16:41,855 --> 03:16:42,879
For people and like

4376
03:16:43,135 --> 03:16:44,671
He's been pushing it so hard

4377
03:16:45,183 --> 03:16:50,815
He has to have some sort of guilt about what he's doing this is a real situation for people well now that he's depressed

4378
03:16:51,071 --> 03:16:54,143
He can't ward off the guilt with his massive ability to

4379
03:16:54,399 --> 03:16:55,167
Deny reality

4380
03:16:55,679 --> 03:16:56,703
Like that's the that's

4381
03:16:56,959 --> 03:16:58,751
The great equalizer of depression in Fort

4382
03:16:59,007 --> 03:17:01,055
Sometimes it does show you reality in it

4383
03:17:01,311 --> 03:17:07,455
It's a real bummer and now he is already said he's never drinking again yeah

4384
03:17:07,967 --> 03:17:08,479
Alex

4385
03:17:09,247 --> 03:17:13,855
Weed legal come on buddy calm it down

4386
03:17:14,111 --> 03:17:15,391
Alex

4387
03:17:15,647 --> 03:17:17,183
Grows out dreadlocks

4388
03:17:17,439 --> 03:17:19,487
August comes in with the wig at figure eight

4389
03:17:19,999 --> 03:17:23,583
I'm sorry one last clip I thought that was the end of the show but then

4390
03:17:23,839 --> 03:17:28,703
You came in for the 4th hour a little bit they were confrontational at best

4391
03:17:29,471 --> 03:17:29,983
But not all that

4392
03:17:30,239 --> 03:17:34,335
Interesting one guy calls in and is like hey you guys

4393
03:17:34,591 --> 03:17:35,359
Who went in like

4394
03:17:35,615 --> 03:17:37,919
You went down to Virginia for the gun rally

4395
03:17:38,175 --> 03:17:39,711
Yeah you know what you know what happened

4396
03:17:39,967 --> 03:17:43,039
The f****** Governor put up a wall you guys didn't do s***

4397
03:17:43,295 --> 03:17:46,111
Guy whose leg

4398
03:17:47,647 --> 03:17:48,671
No no

4399
03:17:48,927 --> 03:17:55,071
You why didn't you murderer everybody Governor is killing babies are you guys doing

4400
03:17:55,327 --> 03:17:56,607
You said you loved

4401
03:17:56,863 --> 03:17:59,679
Killer getting you didn't kill the one time you had the chance

4402
03:17:59,935 --> 03:18:03,519
Alex can't really handle it new just as like

4403
03:18:03,775 --> 03:18:06,591
That we're the Bad Guys not the governor over yet

4404
03:18:07,871 --> 03:18:08,383
Grow up

4405
03:18:08,895 --> 03:18:09,407
It's not Saturday

4406
03:18:09,919 --> 03:18:13,247
But there's one clip hear from that little M segment

4407
03:18:13,503 --> 03:18:14,783
This really makes me think that

4408
03:18:15,039 --> 03:18:15,807
What we're doing is

4409
03:18:16,063 --> 03:18:17,855
Preparing what we're doing is preparing the audience

4410
03:18:18,111 --> 03:18:19,647
It's that like consequences are mountain

4411
03:18:20,415 --> 03:18:21,183
Anna's Bistro

4412
03:18:21,695 --> 03:18:22,463
That

4413
03:18:22,719 --> 03:18:24,255
You won't be able to get his way out of it

4414
03:18:24,767 --> 03:18:26,303
It's like I've almost completed my mission

4415
03:18:27,327 --> 03:18:28,607
So exhausted

4416
03:18:34,495 --> 03:18:36,799
Megan bad about to happen

4417
03:18:37,567 --> 03:18:39,103
I think I may be taking out

4418
03:18:39,871 --> 03:18:41,151
Police officer Bryson

4419
03:18:41,663 --> 03:18:45,503
Say that let me dramatic I want to tell you I love you and I appreciate you

4420
03:18:46,527 --> 03:18:47,039
But

4421
03:18:50,367 --> 03:18:51,903
You want a big stuff going down

4422
03:18:59,327 --> 03:19:00,095
Charlie Clark

4423
03:19:01,375 --> 03:19:01,887
Sure it was

4424
03:19:02,399 --> 03:19:04,703
You just hear there a sense of like

4425
03:19:04,959 --> 03:19:05,471
Preparation

4426
03:19:06,751 --> 03:19:10,591
It's really difficult about this is like how much do you take seriously

4427
03:19:10,847 --> 03:19:13,151
But I don't I don't know what's going to happen

4428
03:19:13,407 --> 03:19:13,919
Like

4429
03:19:14,175 --> 03:19:14,943
When he was

4430
03:19:15,455 --> 03:19:16,479
Financially

4431
03:19:16,735 --> 03:19:17,247
Broke

4432
03:19:17,503 --> 03:19:21,855
Before all this stuff happened and he was able to move massive sales

4433
03:19:22,111 --> 03:19:25,695
Like before that he was in place or he was very clearly

4434
03:19:25,951 --> 03:19:26,463
Repairing the audio

4435
03:19:26,719 --> 03:19:28,255
For the eventual non-existent

4436
03:19:28,511 --> 03:19:29,023
Looking forward

4437
03:19:29,535 --> 03:19:31,071
He was saved at the last minute

4438
03:19:31,327 --> 03:19:32,863
And you know I think

4439
03:19:33,119 --> 03:19:33,887
He was feeling

4440
03:19:34,399 --> 03:19:34,911
Like the needs

4441
03:19:35,167 --> 03:19:36,703
To do that because of the circumstances

4442
03:19:36,959 --> 03:19:37,471
It's rabbit

4443
03:19:37,727 --> 03:19:41,311
Just because I didn't end up being the the reality in the eventuality

4444
03:19:42,591 --> 03:19:44,895
Makes it look like he was just being dramatic

4445
03:19:45,151 --> 03:19:50,015
But I don't think he was I think he was behaving in a way that made total

4446
03:19:50,271 --> 03:19:51,295
And I think here

4447
03:19:51,551 --> 03:19:52,319
Ucn

4448
03:19:52,575 --> 03:19:54,111
Expression of very similar feeling

4449
03:19:54,367 --> 03:19:55,391
On his Parts like

4450
03:19:55,647 --> 03:19:56,159
He's looking

4451
03:19:56,671 --> 03:19:57,695
At the surrounding

4452
03:19:57,951 --> 03:19:59,231
Context of his life and being like

4453
03:20:00,511 --> 03:20:01,791
I might be taking off here soon

4454
03:20:02,047 --> 03:20:03,071
This might

4455
03:20:03,583 --> 03:20:05,119
Teacher takes a week off

4456
03:20:05,631 --> 03:20:07,167
This is the moment that he

4457
03:20:07,679 --> 03:20:09,215
This is the crisis where it's like

4458
03:20:09,471 --> 03:20:09,983
Stop

4459
03:20:10,495 --> 03:20:11,007
Go to rehab

4460
03:20:11,775 --> 03:20:12,799
Get into counseling

4461
03:20:13,055 --> 03:20:13,823
F******

4462
03:20:14,079 --> 03:20:15,615
Do this s*** and then

4463
03:20:15,871 --> 03:20:17,151
There might be a show.

4464
03:20:17,407 --> 03:20:18,687
Back to

4465
03:20:18,943 --> 03:20:19,455
Keep going

4466
03:20:19,711 --> 03:20:20,991
There will no longer be a show

4467
03:20:21,247 --> 03:20:24,319
It feels like a kind of moment before you go off

4468
03:20:26,111 --> 03:20:27,391
You got one tone

4469
03:20:27,647 --> 03:20:33,023
There's no part of me that thinks that car's not going

4470
03:20:33,279 --> 03:20:36,607
There's no feeling that I have videos of any kind of

4471
03:20:36,863 --> 03:20:37,375
Ability

4472
03:20:38,143 --> 03:20:40,703
And I don't think he has a support structure in place

4473
03:20:41,215 --> 03:20:41,983
Clearly these

4474
03:20:42,239 --> 03:20:43,519
They can people around him or no

4475
03:20:44,543 --> 03:20:45,823
If they would allow him to

4476
03:20:46,079 --> 03:20:48,895
Cancel his week vacation because of car horns

4477
03:20:49,151 --> 03:20:49,919
Yep

4478
03:20:50,431 --> 03:20:52,991
Like that means that no one is going to check

4479
03:20:53,247 --> 03:20:53,759
Kim at all

4480
03:20:54,271 --> 03:20:56,831
And the fact that he's continuing to behave very similarly

4481
03:20:57,087 --> 03:20:59,135
In order to sell his silver even at

4482
03:20:59,391 --> 03:21:01,183
After getting his letter from the New York attorney general

4483
03:21:01,439 --> 03:21:03,743
Means that he's not even able or willing

4484
03:21:03,999 --> 03:21:07,583
To adjust his behavior when the consequences consequences are made clear tape

4485
03:21:08,095 --> 03:21:09,631
Yep that's a real sign

4486
03:21:09,887 --> 03:21:10,399
Of trouble

4487
03:21:10,655 --> 03:21:11,935
Now he's got a

4488
03:21:12,191 --> 03:21:12,703
You got to lose

4489
03:21:13,215 --> 03:21:17,311
So I'm not going to make a prediction about what's going to happen but I can I can

4490
03:21:17,567 --> 03:21:21,407
Steve from his behavior from the changing tone the sort of

4491
03:21:21,663 --> 03:21:24,735
Triumphant bombastic Glee of the 12th

4492
03:21:24,991 --> 03:21:26,527
When the media started covering

4493
03:21:26,783 --> 03:21:31,135
Is silver stop by yelling and being like I've got these studies

4494
03:21:32,159 --> 03:21:32,927
Mother Jones

4495
03:21:33,439 --> 03:21:35,487
To the 13th

4496
03:21:35,743 --> 03:21:38,303
I'm still going to be defiant but I'm really sucking

4497
03:21:38,559 --> 03:21:39,583
Depressed everyone's

4498
03:21:39,839 --> 03:21:40,351
Going to die

4499
03:21:40,607 --> 03:21:41,119
I'm I'm

4500
03:21:41,375 --> 03:21:43,679
I'm just so I'm so mad

4501
03:21:43,935 --> 03:21:44,447
Just because if

4502
03:21:44,703 --> 03:21:45,471
If you did have a

4503
03:21:45,727 --> 03:21:46,239
A support structure

4504
03:21:46,751 --> 03:21:47,263
They would just

4505
03:21:47,519 --> 03:21:48,287
Be like hey

4506
03:21:48,799 --> 03:21:49,311
F******

4507
03:21:49,567 --> 03:21:50,079
Quit

4508
03:21:50,591 --> 03:21:51,103
Go to rehab

4509
03:21:51,359 --> 03:21:54,431
Go to counseling I don't think we'd be here at the time

4510
03:21:54,687 --> 03:21:55,711
And then

4511
03:21:55,967 --> 03:21:58,271
Come back and run the Jordan Belfort

4512
03:21:58,783 --> 03:22:00,575
You know you can still run the Griff

4513
03:22:00,831 --> 03:22:02,879
Just do it from the other direction you're reformed

4514
03:22:03,135 --> 03:22:03,647
Mauer whatever

4515
03:22:04,159 --> 03:22:06,207
You'll be fine

4516
03:22:06,719 --> 03:22:09,279
Just live better later

4517
03:22:09,535 --> 03:22:10,047
LED TV

4518
03:22:10,303 --> 03:22:16,447
Exact same space

4519
03:22:16,703 --> 03:22:20,799
These are the Perils of going down this pathway and I live this life and I don't know

4520
03:22:21,055 --> 03:22:22,079
G-Eazy you got

4521
03:22:22,335 --> 03:22:23,103
Charisma

4522
03:22:23,359 --> 03:22:25,151
I don't know I don't know what the path

4523
03:22:25,407 --> 03:22:30,527
Forwarded I really I'm disappointed that he's not taking a week off for my sake and for his

4524
03:22:30,783 --> 03:22:33,855
Honestly I was looking forward

4525
03:22:34,111 --> 03:22:38,207
But now I'm not paying attention to the present

4526
03:22:38,719 --> 03:22:41,279
It's now gotten to the point where his narrative is

4527
03:22:41,535 --> 03:22:45,119
Packed it in and we can expect that largely those will be the

4528
03:22:45,375 --> 03:22:45,887
The pieces

4529
03:22:46,143 --> 03:22:47,423
That move forward

4530
03:22:47,679 --> 03:22:49,983
And he'll try to filter any news that happen

4531
03:22:50,239 --> 03:22:51,007
Through those

4532
03:22:51,263 --> 03:22:52,031
Episode

4533
03:22:52,287 --> 03:22:55,871
I think it'll be a little bit of stagnation I feel that even in these episode

4534
03:22:56,127 --> 03:22:59,711
A bit as there is tons of stuff happening in the real world

4535
03:22:59,967 --> 03:23:01,247
Surrounding the Coronavirus

4536
03:23:02,783 --> 03:23:03,295
Content

4537
03:23:03,551 --> 03:23:04,319
Seems to stagnate

4538
03:23:05,855 --> 03:23:07,135
Acted while the

4539
03:23:07,391 --> 03:23:08,159
The concrete was wet

4540
03:23:08,671 --> 03:23:10,719
He and I would solidified a little bit

4541
03:23:10,975 --> 03:23:12,511
Becomes a little bit less interesting

4542
03:23:12,767 --> 03:23:14,303
From a covering him perspective

4543
03:23:14,815 --> 03:23:16,095
Well not just that but

4544
03:23:16,351 --> 03:23:16,863
Real world

4545
03:23:17,375 --> 03:23:20,191
So much is going on and because Allie Hamilton

4546
03:23:20,447 --> 03:23:20,959
