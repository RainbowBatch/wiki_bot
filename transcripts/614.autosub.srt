1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Shred-it

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for knowledge B

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:01:00,160
Nike.com

5
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:05,792
Sit around and talk a little bit about Alex

6
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,888
Giordano Giordano

7
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:10,912
Sure

8
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:11,936
What is your bright spot today

9
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:15,776
Today is a little bit like sort of on the cusp

10
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:18,592
On your recommendation I've watched

11
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:20,640
Some later season episodes

12
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:23,712
Of The Amazing Race

13
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:28,832
No

14
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:33,184
But I I I watch 1

15
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,976
That was the

16
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:36,512
Sri Lankan

17
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:42,912
Twin sisters

18
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:43,936
Survivor

19
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:44,704
Okay

20
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:49,312
But I guess the bright spot is like

21
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:50,592
I hate

22
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:52,896
He's contesting

23
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:58,272
Most of them kind of all suck

24
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:02,368
Poorly drawn characters most of them are like

25
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:04,416
You're playing up whatever the

26
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:08,256
Fuckyour supposed

27
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,792
Persons of every task

28
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:12,096
Have to be related to a monster truck show

29
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:16,448
Who won carrying tons of bamboo who this is like a monster truck tire go f*** yourself

30
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:25,408
There's a couple Seasons where you have like a father-and-son Duo kind of like that and they are f******

31
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:31,808
Straight up Cat's in the Cradle like level like you know I didn't get to spend as much time with him when he was young like that s***

32
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:36,160
You were just watching your like ok-58 crying the whole time I started the second

33
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,976
Season and there's a dad in some team and its

34
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:45,376
The dad had prostate cancer and then and then his son got testicular cancer

35
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:49,216
Is almost crying talking about watching his kids ghost

36
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:53,824
Generally speaking

37
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,896
Characters

38
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:57,664
Credibly

39
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,432
False

40
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,200
And

41
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:01,504
Acted poorly

42
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,272
But I

43
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:06,368
Enjoyable anyway that is like I really

44
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,904
Dislike these people

45
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:13,792
Get a kind of charge out of that maybe that's why people like reality TV

46
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:14,816
Is

47
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,608
All the challenges you know

48
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,424
How they they show up somewhere and they like you can go to this

49
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,704
1 or you can go to this one

50
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:23,008
They always make it seem like it's a Chase

51
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:24,544
Huge choice in

52
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,664
To go like sitting across the entire way but if you if you like every now and then you can get a glimpse

53
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,688
Then they're like right now

54
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,832
The camera pans

55
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:37,600
Turn left

56
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:40,416
Yeah I that is fun and I also

57
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,184
Be like

58
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:42,720
Sometimes

59
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:45,024
The things I have to choose between doing

60
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:49,888
Anyone who hasn't watched the show when they get to a thing called a roadblock

61
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:50,912
They will have a choice

62
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:53,216
It's of two different tasks they have to do one

63
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:56,800
Sometimes they're about as hard

64
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:58,080
As each other and

65
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:59,360
Sometimes one of them

66
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:02,944
Acquires

67
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,736
Another one is like

68
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,528
Eat a croissant

69
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,648
No I ran out again you'll see somebody at their build bill just have a

70
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,952
A couple of scenes and then the third one they're like

71
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,000
6 hours later you like cheese

72
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:16,768
F******

73
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,047
Yeah yeah

74
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:24,447
Choosing like The Simple Solution like watermelon

75
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:26,239
Pyramid do is f****** hard

76
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,775
And now the Sun is setting

77
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:31,615
If you're getting a divorce

78
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:34,943
Okay balance is bottle on your head or find the Earth

79
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,247
Mantle okay fine okay

80
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:43,135
It's a dumb show I hate it

81
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,671
Guided anyway what you write about

82
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:48,767
Lite-Brite Spider-Man is I went to Whiskey Fest

83
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,815
My partner and I went to Whiskey

84
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:54,655
A couple years ago my partners

85
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,191
Bought us tickets

86
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:59,007
Kind of the one of the things that we really have in common

87
00:04:59,263 --> 00:04:59,775
Dial

88
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:00,543
AIDS

89
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01,567
Exact

90
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:07,967
So we were going to go is going to be a whole bonding experience we're going to do the whole thing you know there was a

91
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:08,735
The thing

92
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:09,759
Years go by

93
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:15,903
Whiskey Fest

94
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,951
Cancel that was the main thing that happened

95
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:20,255
Gbd

96
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:26,655
So we were going to go but then she's she's Abby elderly persuasion so she had a bit of an illness she couldn't

97
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:27,423
Makeup

98
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:33,823
And you couldn't make it and she was supposed to be getting a tattoo

99
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:38,431
Going to go alone that would have been really weird plumber

100
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:42,783
It would have been a million times Saturday than I could have imagined luckily my partners

101
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:43,551
Tattoo felt

102
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,135
And I it was not what I was

103
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,159
Expecting okay

104
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:48,927
I thought it

105
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:55,327
It was going to be like a tasting thing with everybody tiny bits

106
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,351
It was

107
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:58,655
You you did text little tiny bit

108
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,447
It was more of like a

109
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,215
Car show

110
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:07,615
Lego people with their weighers yeah yeah like Jack Daniels had a big ol thing in there

111
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:12,991
You know it was it was very strange it was not what I was expecting and we stayed there

112
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:18,367
Literally what I was expecting when you said Whiskey sauce

113
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:20,927
I just don't think you hurt you so you pitched

114
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,975
To me is something that is like high-end

115
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:29,375
Classy you got to wear a suit

116
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:32,191
Happened I think what happened is it was going to be that

117
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:35,263
I doubt it okay well let's just

118
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,031
Make it

119
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,567
I doubt it could babe

120
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:43,967
It was never that class so weird because I did not sell or destroy

121
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:44,735
Tribute sky

122
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:47,807
Bourbon or any types of whiskey

123
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,367
I'm just there and they're like okay

124
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:53,951
Next we have a seminar my one

125
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:59,839
You don't have a seminar was full of booze

126
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:02,399
A seminar on

127
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:05,983
There's a really great peanut butter whiskey

128
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:12,383
I'm sure I had that like a year or two ago I was good it was

129
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:14,943
I was with somebody who is like a

130
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,735
Bit of a snob too and they're like

131
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:17,759
This is fantastic

132
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:23,391
Yeah it was time I also got it with the health Ranger let me use in town

133
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:26,463
Yeah it was fantastic and the lady to

134
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:27,487
Was like okay

135
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:28,767
Going to pour some cranberry juice

136
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:32,863
Right on

137
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:33,887
Right on

138
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:34,655
Wonderful

139
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:38,239
Not bright spot

140
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:43,359
As promised we will be looking at to the old

141
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:46,175
Richarlison documentary Patriot Purge

142
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:52,319
Alex Jones claims he did the background work on and probably is going to take credit for course

143
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:54,111
I wrote the whole thing

144
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:56,927
Tucker's actually me

145
00:07:57,183 --> 00:08:01,279
Eye Prosthetics we did a Faceoff kind of thing interests

146
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:03,071
Except the Face-Off

147
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,119
Anyway

148
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:05,887
This

149
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:09,215
This documentary sucks did the Patriots win

150
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:11,263
I don't know what that would mean

151
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,311
Well I mean were they perch

152
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:15,615
No but it would

153
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:22,015
Doesn't look great by the end of the document

154
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:23,807
Yes

155
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:27,903
Gotcha

156
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:29,951
Julio Alexander's hand was cut off

157
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:30,719
Got it

158
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:37,119
So I will get all the Myriad ways

159
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:37,887
It's terrible

160
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,959
Let's take a little

161
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:44,799
The first librarian mobile

162
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:47,871

163
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:51,455
Blippi library in Mobile

Will be back

166
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:58,879
But until then we have a website thank you so much and I'll probably want

167
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:02,463
Google

168
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:11,167
Bestway food canes

169
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:14,495

Anthony

00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:45,727
Like to say hello and I'm not a big fan of narcissistic

175
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:46,495
Technocrat

176
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:58,527
Money off at heroin

177
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:03,135
Is freakishly large

178
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:10,815
Thank you so much I think Mingus actually was the one who originated paranoid narcissist

179
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:14,911
Charlie Mingus

180
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:31,295
I like the complete randomness of you pulling Fats Waller

181
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:37,183
Can I tell you why I know that

182
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,975
Sew in

183
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:39,999
What would it have been

184
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,279
Middle School I think

185
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,327
I was in the act

186
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:48,703
Club or acting class or whatever and we did a musical called we Haz jazz

187
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:54,591
Enough people to play all of the roles are

188
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:58,431
Who was the main kid who like was super into jazz

189
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,967
The play a jazz musician

190
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:01,759
Another part in the

191
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:07,903
The play and I was Fats Waller

192
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:10,975
I I can't I'm sorry but I cannot imagine

193
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:12,511
Any story of you like

194
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:13,535
Before

195
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,071
You know 8th grade where you don't

196
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:17,375
Still have the exact same voice you do right now

197
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:23,775
Like eight years old year you've got a deep solder as a baby I came up I came out of the womb

198
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,823
Baritone

199
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:30,687
Yeah I don't know I also look back at my my younger years and I project

200
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:34,527
My voice and appeared on to my younger self

201
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:37,599
Jordan we're talking here about this

202
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:39,391
Patriot Purge

203
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,927
And it's very

204
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,975
Closely related to a lot of Alex Jones

205
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:43,743
Stop syrup

206
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:46,303
It doesn't it feels in the ballpark in

207
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,839
I texted you about this

208
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,375
I think that there is

209
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,679
A shocking overlap

210
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,471
Some really

211
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,519
Particularly important difference

212
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:56,799
I mean the kind of

213
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,591
Stop the Tucker is putting out here

214
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,871
Hannah stuff that Alex

215
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:03,455
Put that routinely and I hope that is something that we can explore its

216
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,735
Think about as we go through the

217
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:05,503
This contact

218
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:12,415
The first important thing that I want to point out and I think it's really important to understand about this series of documentaries

219
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:18,047
Is it they're designed to be just as much of a marketing campaign as they are an exploration of the events

220
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:18,815
January 6th

221
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:22,911
They were very specifically aired only on Fox Nation

222
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:25,727
Fox News online streaming platform that requires a

223
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,007
Access

224
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:32,639
Platform allows Fox to disseminate some of the more f***** up content they would like to are normally

225
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:35,199
Stuff it might attract a little bit too much

226
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:38,015
If it was on broadcast television

227
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:40,063
For instance there currently on season 8

228
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:42,111
8 of a show called The firman Diary

229
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:47,231
Detective Mark Fuhrman discusses important criminal cases

230
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:53,887
Also the Fuhrman Diaries shouldn't be confused with the fermentate

231
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:57,471
Which were 13 hours of recorded interviews where Furman said all sorts

232
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:01,567
The racist shiting an active participant in racist police and Pratt

233
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,359
That's why you gave him an online

234
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,639
From the transcript

235
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:08,479
I'd like to point out that is a hard r

236
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:14,367
Boat driving a Porsche that doesn't look like he's got a $300 suit on you always stop him

237
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,415
Another excerpt

238
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:22,815
First thing anything out of an endsmouth for the first five or six sentences is a f****** lie

239
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,911
I mean you know that's a little arbitrary

240
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,959
Sure what about this

241
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:32,031
Is a discussion of how he treated as suspected gang member

242
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,823
We basically tortured

243
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:36,383
The four policemen four guys we broke up

244
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,407
Their faces were just

245
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:40,479
Mush pictures of the walls of blood all the way up to

246
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:41,759
To the ceiling and finger marks

247
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,295
So trying to crawl out of the room

248
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:50,207
Great they're great where they came from but the point is

249
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,743
Giant pile of s*** as a person

250
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,791
His expertise of the cop is also worth

251
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:58,143
Fox Nation has made eight seasons of a show where you presented as a credible

252
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,679
Expert and the host

253
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:00,447
Wow

254
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,727
Just terrible

255
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:08,639
Fellow piece of s*** to Nancy Grace has a show on the network along with your good buddy Robert Jeffress

256
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:12,479
Boring ass Fox News style contest

257
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,783
According to an article in Forbes

258
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:17,855
In June 2020 the Fox Nation

259
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:21,695
Between your two hundred thousand subscribers somewhere in that range

260
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,719
No

261
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:24,255
Which is not super great numbers

262
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:32,447
Then in February 2021 it was announced

263
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:35,263
The Tucker Carlson it signed a deal to create Fox Nation

264
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,287
Exclusive content

265
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,079
That's including his truck show.

266
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,359
Richarlison today

267
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:42,943
Images allegedly in-depth investigations called Tucker Carlson

268
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:49,343
Say what you want about this guy but he's incredibly good at making sure his name is front-and-center on every project

269
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,111
Betty does

270
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:54,975
Crossfire was really just about the Bowtie but now that he's a man every project

271
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:55,743
Is Tucker Carlson

272
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,791
Send something or it doesn't get made

273
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:03,679
Unless the Project's get that man

274
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:11,359
Contract to do the next Madea you know like that's what we got to do. Tyler Perry just put his name on everything

275
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:15,199
Exactly

276
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:20,575
Perry Madea

277
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:23,391
Was Tucker Carlson present threat

278
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:26,207
Attraction

279
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:29,791
Tucker Carlson today

280
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,095
Desperate

281
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:34,655
Everyone expect by may there's

282
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:36,959
Script numbers are gone up 40%

283
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:38,239
Tucker Carlson

284
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,007
And started making

285
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,031
Exclusive content

286
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:43,871
Tucker Carlson is the marketable franchise player that talks

287
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:47,967
His shows are really essential to attracting viewers to the Fox Nation

288
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:48,735
Platform

289
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:53,343
Where did Mendelssohn be drawn toward programs like hearing Mark Fuhrman's dump takes over

290
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:55,903
You could watch geraldo's a reboot of

291
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:56,671
Cops

292
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:00,511
Anyway this is an important Dynamic to understand when you begin approaching

293
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:03,327
A topic like covering this documentary Patriot perch

294
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:07,679
At least some element of this presentation is meant to attract backlash

295
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,703
Which will in turn increase

296
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:09,471
Subscriber count

297
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:10,495
Apps for Fox Nation

298
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:14,335
This isn't to say that nothing in the documentary series is sincere

299
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:15,359
Just important

300
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,383
Recognize that

301
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,479
Some of the marketing and branding surrounding it was intentionally Sensational for the sake

302
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:21,503
Driving traffic

303
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,783
I am selling some

304
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:27,391
With that caveat out of the way we can begin to touch on the meat of this show

305
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,951
I watch the series a few times

306
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:31,743
The argument is this

307
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:32,767
As best as I can

308
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:33,535
Intel

309
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:37,119
I need to clarify that the messaging of these

310
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,911
Three episodes is a little bit out of

311
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,703
I was thinking there's a couple of points where logic

312
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:41,727
Turtle eating

313
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:42,751
Consistent

314
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:44,543
There is essentially an overarching

315
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,823
Sing conspiracy that's being

316
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:50,943
A group of folks who aren't specified maybe the Deep State maybe the globalist

317
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:51,967
Maybe the permanent

318
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:52,991
Government

319
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:58,367
About mischaracterizing the things that happened on January 6th in order to present

320
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,135
Conservative

321
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:01,695
Christians as terrorists because they want to use the national

322
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:02,719
Security apparatus

323
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:03,999
And the Patriot Act

324
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,279
That's the right way

325
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,607
People have tried to denigrate Tucker by saying he's going full in

326
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,399
Infowars

327
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,423
Exactly how right

328
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,191
Right they are

329
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:16,543
This documentary is a Slicker but less gel-filled presentation

330
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,591
Conspiracies that Alex has been pushing for like

331
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,359
Like 20 years

332
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:26,527
The real substantive differences that I can identify is that in Alex's version of the story passing the Patriot Act was

333
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,063
Who were the reason

334
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:30,111
Eventually using it against

335
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,903
People where is in Tucker's telling

336
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:33,951
It's kind of just a happy accident for the back

337
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:35,999
That I mean good for

338
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:40,863
Sure the globalist protector break finally

339
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:44,703
Pictures of did not have to worry about one aspect of the plan for what

340
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:45,727
Alex

341
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:46,495
Lowe's

342
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:47,519
Tucker and

343
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,287
Documentary

344
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:50,591
But if I were Alex watching this IB

345
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:51,359
Terrified

346
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,895
I'm feeling about as obsolete as

347
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:53,663
Woody

348
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,943
In Toy Story 3

349
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:57,503
If I were him I would also realize that it

350
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:00,575
100% time to innovate

351
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:04,927
As far as Thompson said when the going gets weird the weird turn pro

352
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:07,231
And there is no-one weirder than Alex Jones

353
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:10,047
If he wants have any chance of retaining the mantle

354
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:10,815
King of the Fall

355
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:11,839
F***** up right-wing mount

356
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:14,911
He's going to have to take some kind of a big narrative risk

357
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,191
You know because he's got to stop

358
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:17,215
Beating his own path

359
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:19,519
Through the woods

360
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:20,543
Easy use

361
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,311
But yeah

362
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,591
He's going to be left in the dust

363
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:24,383
Better funded and less

364
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:29,759
Clearly insane demagogues yeah apparently can push the same sort of s*** that he does

365
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,831
What does he want to be like someone who's

366
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:34,111
Just riding along

367
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,647
Find Tucker ride

368
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,439
F****** ego the size of pics

369
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,231
Coronavirus

370
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:42,303
If you never believe we're here

371
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:44,863
Successful he would lead to his own

372
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,655
That's that's barely

373
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:47,679
Regular piano

374
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:50,495
At the very beginning if he's so far out there and he

375
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:51,519
He succeeds enough

376
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,055
To drag everyone to have then

377
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,079
They're going to be better people

378
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:59,711
We sucks I kind of look at this and I feel like it may play out

379
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:00,735
Is that

380
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:06,367
Right now Alex and Tucker are in an uneasy tag team in the wrestling world

381
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:09,439
Another there their tag team of people who Maybe

382
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:16,095
Haven't gotten along in the past or whatever but they're really just a tag team until they inevitably break up in 5

383
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,119
Sooner or later

384
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:17,887
Tucker's going to hit

385
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:18,655
Alex with the chair

386
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,775
That would be the blow off today

387
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:25,823
I guess probably

388
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,359
McDonald's

389
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,919
I wish Alex all the worst

390
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:31,455
With whatever is coming

391
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:34,015
As for me I don't really difficult time trying

392
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:35,295
To figure out how to cover this ship

393
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:38,367
I think over the course of this you'll see like I said so there's some

394
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,647
Real similarities

395
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:41,695
The presentation has to Alex's work

396
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:43,231
But also some really important if

397
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:50,399
It was my sincere intention to cover all three parts of the series but I think you'll see why it would just be impossible without me

398
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,935
Bring my laptop out the window

399
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:52,959
I did watch

400
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:56,031
The series in its entirety if you times but today we're just talkin about the

401
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:57,311
The first episode which is

402
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,335
Densely-packed

403
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,871
With complete bulshit

404
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:02,943
Auto next episode to cover bit about how Alex

405
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:05,503
Just talked about the release of the documentaries which is kind of like

406
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:06,527
I don't know

407
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:08,575
A less fun version of my Caravan

408
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:09,855
Body project

409
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:14,719
I'll try to come up with a good pun for the name of the series but all I could come up with his Danza sucker for Tucker

410
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:19,583
Ditto massage to the great 1999 album by kurupt

411
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,887
The streets is a mother Tucker

412
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:23,423
Going to go with how about

413
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,447
Patriot dirt

414
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:29,055
My bad I was kind of trying to

415
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,335
Trying to make a Tucker Pawn

416
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,103
Yeah

417
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:34,943
I was just trying to Pawn off the the general vibe there I don't know how to make it

418
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:36,223
Other than like

419
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:41,855
I can't not

420
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:45,695
So let's so let's start off here at the

421
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:47,487
Beginning of the documentary where

422
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,535
The theme

423
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:50,303
The premise

424
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,095
And playing a bunch of clips

425
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:52,863
Better

426
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:53,631
In support

427
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:54,655
Of his

428
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:55,423
Narrative

429
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:57,727
In the Years After

430
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:00,543
Media

431
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,311
And the Nationals

432
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:03,615
Security State between

433
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:06,943
Al-Qaeda and Saddam when he talked about the war on terror

434
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:08,479
Exaggerated

435
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:09,247
Traps

436
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:10,527
Deception

437
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:12,319
Between Al-Qaeda

438
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:13,599
And Saddam

439
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,391
There are other

440
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:17,184
We know they have

441
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,000
Associates

442
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:25,632
Events 9/11 is Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction

443
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:34,080
So the argument that opens the first episode is almost staggering in

444
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:34,848
Presentation

445
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:39,712
Sevilla basically like an SAT kind of formulation we're lying about weapons

446
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:44,064
Sons of mass destruction after 9/11 is do the Iraq War as blaming whites

447
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,880
Supremacist for January 6th is to the coming Purge

448
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:47,904
Of all white Chris

449
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,672
Conservatives

450
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:55,072
From site was all about the war in Iraq

451
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:56,096
Starting

452
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:03,776
An idiot to me how he conveniently ignores that he was

453
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:06,336
Is the people he's talking about

454
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:09,920
He's a ghost people who push the b******* in Annapolis

455
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:14,016
Turned against it eventually but we'll talk about that later

456
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:15,808
Anyway he seems to forget his own past

457
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:17,088
The bunch that's a very

458
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:18,624
Consistent pattern

459
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,488
Call to forget your own past whenever you are exactly the thing that you are telling people to Jesus or is

460
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:26,048
Before we go any further I want to take a moment.

461
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,328
Discuss

462
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:28,352
People in the crew

463
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:30,656
In this documentary

464
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:31,680
Behind the scenes

465
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:33,216
You check out a little bit of this

466
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:35,776
You might end up seeing if something is rotten

467
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:37,056
In the state of Denmark

468
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:39,104
Credited writers of this film

469
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:39,872
Or Tucker

470
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:41,664
And a guy named scooter Downey

471
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:44,480
Scooter is a filmmaker who directed Lauren

472
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:46,784
Southern's latest offering

473
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,808
Called Crossfire

474
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,880
Here's the problem here's the problem

475
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:51,904
Problem number one

476
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,952
You can't have it like

477
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:57,024
Here's Hitler's minister of propaganda

478
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,096
Scooter

479
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:00,864
Scary games

480
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:04,192
Studer here's the leader of the SS

481
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,728
Weebly

482
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,800
Evil if your name

483
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:10,080
Scooter

484
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:17,760
Lauren Southern's latest movie called Crossfire

485
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:19,808
This was a course the follow-up to her

486
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:21,344
Completely full of s*** film

487
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,928
Farm lands in borderless so anyone who would work with her after that point

488
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,232
Automatically is suspect in my book

489
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,304
Scooter was also the director of a film called hoax

490
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:36,448
This was an attempt to make a documentary about how the media is all fake news and they lie to claim the people like

491
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:38,752
Alex Jones Mike cernovich James

492
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:39,520
Keith Gavin

493
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,800
McGinnis Lauren Southern

494
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:44,896
Stefan molyneux are liars make the light to make them look like liars

495
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:49,760
Proven by interviews with Alex Jones Mike cernovich James O'Keefe Gavin McInnes Lauren Southern

496
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:51,808
Stefan molyneux I kind of think

497
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:57,696
They might have I think they might have a conflict of interest as far as

498
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:58,464
Developing

499
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,744
Scooters work

500
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:03,072
The rest of the crew is mostly Tucker his team from Tucker

501
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:04,608
Open tonight in Fox producers

502
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:08,448
But this scooter character being the only other credited writer on this project

503
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:12,800
Pretty interesting Staffing decision and by interesting I mean transparent

504
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:15,872
Yeah it doesn't get that

505
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:18,688
Yep this is the problem

506
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,528
Now now that we're going from a CNN piece to this

507
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:23,552
I'm sitting here like

508
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:24,576
Why isn't

509
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:26,112
Tucker cigs

510
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,744
September 11th we were listening to Jay-Z

511
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:35,584
And now they're starting World War 3 like I can't not do it

512
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,656
It's got to be there may have to stop at scooters

513
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:40,448
Get on this

514
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:44,544
I don't like your rhyming please don't do that anymore

515
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:47,360
Beer

516
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:49,152
This is going to take forever

517
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:53,248
You'll be here for a week

518
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:58,112
So Tucker is talking about how they're trying to make you afraid of

519
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:00,160
The white Army the white

520
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:04,512
White Terror Army that's behind all of the stuff like you're saying

521
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:05,280
Need to make me afraid

522
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:06,560
The very same

523
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:07,328
Kurupt intro

524
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:17,824
Is the most

525
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,848
Regal threat

526
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:21,152
So I don't know if it's

527
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:22,688
It's Colin Powell who's

528
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:28,576
I don't know if it's the people who are pushing their rack what is Condoleezza Rice

529
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:32,672
Behind trying to make us afraid of January 6th

530
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:34,208
I don't know if

531
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,560
So I don't think anyone is saying if there's a white Terror Army that's just sucker

532
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:41,120
For creating a ludicrous strawman to argue again

533
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:43,168
Really doesn't have a leg to stand on again

534
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:43,936
Ansari Larkin

535
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:50,592
Which is a bunch of violent white supremacist and white nationalist groups either ideological

536
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:51,616
Quote Trump

537
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:53,664
Really won the 2020 election

538
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:58,272
Campaign or who recognized that that's a really fertile recruiting pool for them to

539
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:01,088
None of us are allowed in Wyoming

540
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:04,160
If we are so upset about this

541
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:06,208
These corrupt people who got us into the Iraq War

542
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:07,232
Considering these supported

543
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,000
Promoted

544
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:14,656
Centre branded as an intervention by populist so you know who plays up this anti-war credibility but it's not

545
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:15,936
That's for reasons it will get it

546
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:16,704
Ventilator

547
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:17,984
It's just super weird

548
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,008
Like I said earlier

549
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:20,800
Tucker insist on calling up he's corrupt

550
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:22,336
Delete from the Iraq War era but

551
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:23,616
Forget what he did

552
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:30,016
Child with Millions upon millions of dollars

553
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:31,808
Who supported the Iraq War

554
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:35,904
And you can't trust these wealthy Elites who supported the Iraq War

555
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:39,744
Also that clip that played of biting the end there is absolutely

556
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,512
Play correct

557
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:46,656
An analysis compiled by the center for strategic and International Studies reviewed 893 incidents

558
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:48,192
Definition of damask

559
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:49,216
Terrorism in the United

560
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:53,056
January 1994 and May 8th

561
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:55,872
2020 900 webcam where whites

562
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:58,688
Their number showed that one

563
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:00,736
The vast majority of terrorist attacks

564
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:01,504
Simplot Sunday night

565
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,784
What states were committed by group

566
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,576
Defined by a right-wing ideology

567
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:07,904
In the six years leading up to 2020

568
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:08,928
Proportion of attack

569
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:10,720
Text carried out by right-wing groups has

570
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:12,256
With almost two

571
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:13,280
Two-thirds of the attacks

572
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:15,328
2019 being done by right-wing groups

573
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:19,168
And over 90% of the period between January and May 8th

574
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,192
20

575
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:24,544
Right-wing groups are responsible for a greater percentage of terrorism than any other type

576
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,848
Group for almost every year on the chart

577
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:29,408
With the exception of a few years in the early 2000

578
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:32,480
After 9/11

579
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:33,504
And left-wing groups

580
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,064
Like the animal Liberation Front and the Earth liberation

581
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,112
Confront carried out targeted attacks

582
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,904
Against the property

583
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:43,488
Play can take proportionality because

584
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:50,144
Paper gets chilled out

585
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,984
Accepted terror attack

586
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:59,360
Further these researchers found that religiously-motivated terrorism has killed the most

587
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:02,432
People in that time. But that's only because of 911

588
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:08,064
However if you look at the data more granularly you'll find that right-wing terrorism is a way bourquin

589
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:09,088
Threat

590
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:11,648
In 14 of the 21 years but

591
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:13,952
Between 1994 and 2019

592
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:14,720
In which

593
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:16,512
Attacks occurred

594
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:19,072
The majority of deaths resulted from right wing attack

595
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:22,400
In eight of these years right-wing attackers caused

596
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:24,192
All of the fatalities and

597
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:24,960
3 more

598
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:25,728
Including 28

599
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:27,008
18 and 2019

600
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:30,336
They were responsible for more than 90% of annual fatalities

601
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:31,872
So sure it's

602
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:36,480
Absurd to try and pretend that there's a white Terror Army that poses a threat to us in the United States

603
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:40,064
It's mostly because the right-wing has some experience of the terrorism game

604
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,088
And they have four

605
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:47,744
Decades follow the Louis beam leaderless resistance model

606
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,840
Y'all be like somebody's got to stop that white Terror Army but now we're all like

607
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:53,120
We can't stop them

608
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:53,888
They're Oliver

609
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:55,680
Kind of know

610
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:57,728
They kind of know that if there was

611
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,776
Harambe would not work

612
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:00,800
It's almost like

613
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:01,568
Because they pay

614
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:04,384
I had so much cover from people like Tucker

615
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,944
Dawson 400 years or so

616
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,992
Figured out how to get away with all the

617
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:09,760
I love this shitt

618
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:10,528
Well

619
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:14,368
Still be operating within a certain plausible deniability

620
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,136
Sure

621
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:18,976
A lot of this documentary is just based on Tucker ass

622
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:19,744
Asking loaded

623
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,512
Good questions

624
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:21,280
Is that alright

625
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:22,304
Supposed to

626
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,328
Give you a knife

627
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:25,376
Children dead

628
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:29,472
January 6th is being used as a preacher

629
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:30,496
Strip

630
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:31,520
Millions of Mara

631
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:39,200
Exactly

632
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:42,016
How much are

633
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:48,928
Darren Beattie

634
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:50,464
Revolver news is one of the

635
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,232
You in me

636
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:54,048
Actually

637
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,864
What are the few

638
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,168
What's constitute real reporting real

639
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,008
Definition of tariff

640
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:05,056
There's so much of this like

641
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:10,688
How much is it was alive

642
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:11,712
Why would you make

643
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:13,504
Why would you make a battery

644
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:16,320
The end result of it is like hey you know what

645
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:19,648
Media got it right

646
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:21,952
Little bit but not much we never got

647
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:26,048
So he has this guy Darren Beattie

648
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:30,144
Who's the head of revolver news

649
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:31,680
If you'd like

650
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:32,960
Legit offended me

651
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:34,752
On this thing

652
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:39,616
Greedy is a great minister of propaganda named scooter Nobita must do the video

653
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:44,992
You much for me I can't handle that was probably about the first point where I almost

654
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:46,272
Just said f****** okay

655
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:49,344
Darren Beattie

656
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:50,880
Bernews is one of the

657
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:53,696
Supporting

658
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:54,464
What actually

659
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:57,280
The establishment

660
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:58,560
The worst single-a

661
00:30:59,072 --> 00:30:59,584
Vertical violence

662
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:01,632
Civil War Donald Trump supporters

663
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:02,656
Killing police officer

664
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:04,448
Maga

665
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:05,216
Bloodline

666
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:08,800
Officer Brian sicnic died after being hit in the head

667
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:11,872
They beat

668
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:13,664
Capitol Police office

669
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,224
The fire extinguisher

670
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:20,576
Fight

671
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:22,880
Age of 42

672
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:29,280
The fire extinguisher

673
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:35,424
Fire extinguisher

674
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,192
Problem with this

675
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,312
The New York Times has quietly retracted its story

676
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:42,336
About the death

677
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:43,872
The capitol police officer Brian

678
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,664
There is nothing

679
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:47,968
Which are involved at all

680
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,248
And the paper is backpack

681
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:51,040
Possible

682
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:52,064
It was never

683
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:52,832
Pinhead at all

684
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,160
First thing that I want to point out this is very very important

685
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:56,928
Is the Darren is

686
00:31:57,184 --> 00:32:01,280
Way out of line referring to shoddy reporting that was later retracted and corrected

687
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,304
With blood

688
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:04,864
If you want to say that the media was

689
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,704
Was eager to blame officer sickness death on the Trump supporters at the Capitol

690
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:09,728
Be my gas

691
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:13,312
Use the term Maga blood libel is a disgrace

692
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,336
And honestly that is a

693
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,872
Disqualifying ComEd

694
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:16,896
I can't I

695
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:17,920
It's awful

696
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:20,992
The blood libel is an Insidious false accusation

697
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:22,272
Pittsfield Generations event

698
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:23,040
Peace Medical

699
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:24,064
Conspiracy theories

700
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,344
Who played the countless deaths

701
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,368
Untold suffering

702
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,976
The Coop that turn to exaggerate Trump supporters oppression

703
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:32,256
Wheatley unaccepted

704
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:33,792
Especially considering

705
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:35,584
Percentage of the people

706
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,120
Apple January 6th rally

707
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:38,400
Qanon followers

708
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:40,448
Who believed the police kidnap children

709
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:43,520
Torture them and drink their blood to get high on adrenochrome witch

710
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:46,848
Just basically nothing more than a modern-day version of the blood libel

711
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,128
F*** this dude

712
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:49,152
Right off the bat

713
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:49,920
It is

714
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:51,200
It is a

715
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:52,736
Time-honored

716
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:54,784
And effective

717
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,600
Wait for them to kind of neutralize so much

718
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:58,624
Horrific

719
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,160
Fix it by just claiming that

720
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:00,928
No it's happening

721
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:04,768
And using those terms to the point where it lowers their

722
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:05,792
Affect

723
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:06,816
In elf

724
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:12,704
Darren baby is the news editor for revolver a headline aggregator that's clearly looking to

725
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,032
To become the Drudge Report for the modern unhinged right-wing news can

726
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:16,800
Consumer

727
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:20,384
Alex routinely grabs headlines when they're to yell about networks like Tucker's

728
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,152
In the business APUSH

729
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:21,920
This guy too

730
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:24,224
He was formerly a

731
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,248
Trump speech writer

732
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,016
Forget this

733
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:31,136
He lost that position in 2018 because he was too closely associated with white nationalist

734
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,208
You know how much of a bigot you have to be to get thrown out of the

735
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:35,488
The Trump Administration

736
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,792
Like Steven Miller stay the whole time

737
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:38,560
The whole time

00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:39,840
Hold on

739
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:43,680
Giving a speech at the 2016 meeting of the

740
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:44,448
BHL make

741
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:48,288
Can club which is basically just a group of high-minded intellectual race

742
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:49,056
Sister Nazi

743
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:55,200
In a 2013 article in the Village Voice splc researcher Mark potok describe them this way

744
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:01,088
They're essentially advocating for a country which is either completely inhabited by whites or Dominic

745
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:01,856
Hated by whites

746
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:03,648
They are inside

747
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:05,440
Lactaid Kinder gentler Clan

748
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:07,232
To give you some idea of the

749
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:09,024
The ilk that hang out there

750
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,560
Spencer was one of their board my

751
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:16,448
So baby got fired from the Trump Administration for being too closely associated with explicitly races

752
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:17,984
Spoke and then transitioned into

753
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,800
To being the racist media is new favorite link aggregator

754
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:23,360
According to Tucker one of the

755
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:26,176
A few journalists who's actually doing reporting on January

756
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:27,968
This is nonsense

757
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:30,528
And to allow someone like Beatty to call something

758
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:32,832
The Maga blood libel without dealing with his

759
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:35,136
Very unsavory past in the fact

760
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:36,672
Sizable amount of stalkers audience

761
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:37,440
Believe

762
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,720
Actual blood libel

763
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:40,512
Is astonishingly bad stuff

764
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,048
Block this

765
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:46,144
As for the issue with offers their sick Nick there definitely was some bad report

766
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:46,912
Going down on that front

767
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:47,936
I can't I can't

768
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:49,472
Dispute that my cat argue with it

769
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:54,848
But I would really like to see taco or Beatty try to make a coherent argument that this reporting wasn't done

770
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:55,616
In good faith

771
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:57,408
With the information that was available

772
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:01,248
When new information came to light these Outlets made Corrections

773
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,016
Retraction

774
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:03,296
Even this

775
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:04,832
Steven B documentaries side

776
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:05,600
They claimed that they were

777
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:07,136
Quietly retracting

778
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:09,440
Yeah I don't know what I don't know how you qualify the

779
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:12,512
Volume of a retraction but put it in their paper

780
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:14,304
Quietly

781
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:17,632
Officer sicnic didn't die until January

782
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:19,424
And most of the media that covered

783
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,496
The story about a press release put out by the United States

784
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:23,264
Capitol Police

785
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,032
Department

786
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,312
From that press release

787
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:26,848
Officer 6

788
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:31,456
Nick was responding to the riots on Wednesday January 6th 2021 at the US Capitol

789
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:32,992
Was injured while physic

790
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:34,272
We engaging with Proto

791
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:37,088
He returned to his Division office and collapse

792
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:38,880
He was taken to a local

793
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:40,928
Hospital where he succumbed to his injuries

794
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:43,232
The release goes on to say quote

795
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:48,096
The death of officer sicnic will be investigated by the Metropolitan Police Department's homicide brain

796
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,144
This press release wood

797
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,216
Very strongly lead one to believe that sickness

798
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:55,264
Kids suffered injuries in the line of duty at

799
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,032
The capital

800
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:58,080
I thought you died upon returning to the office

801
00:35:58,336 --> 00:35:59,616
From said injuries

802
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:03,712
They literally say in the press release that it's being investigated by the homicide branch

803
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:05,504
I'm so it would be pretty reasonable

804
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,272
Take from that.

805
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:09,344
The Capitol Police Department were suspecting that this was a murder

806
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,928
And that was the information they were releasing to the public at that

807
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:16,256
On January 8th the New York Times reported that

808
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:17,792
Picnic it been hit in the head with a fire

809
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:22,400
This reporting was based on two Anonymous sources with inline 4

810
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:23,936
But by February 6th

811
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:26,752
Keep the times had done further examination and

812
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:27,776
Updated their articles

813
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:28,800
To reflect that this might

814
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:29,824
Not be accurate a

815
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,640
Information that have been supplied to them by their sources

816
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:33,920
They did that

817
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:35,712
Because they're good Journeys Catholic

818
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:41,856
All this was done well before the DC medical examiner release sickness cause of death

819
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:43,648
Did die of natural causes after having a

820
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:44,416
Stroke

821
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:49,024
By April the Associated Press was widely reporting that even though there was an issue

822
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,608
Chatter that

823
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:55,168
There wasn't any evidence that any of it lead

824
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:55,936
To his death

825
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,032
Tokaido

826
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:00,800
No

827
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:02,848
I don't know where you're going to point

828
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:05,152
Probably the cops

829
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:11,552
Sure

830
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:17,952
They were given by the cops Tucker documentary about the cops giving the media in

831
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:21,280
Inaccurate

832
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:22,816
I also think that

833
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:23,584
You know I

834
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,352
I don't

835
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:26,400
Necessarily know in this case

836
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:27,680
How much you

837
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:28,448
You could prove that

838
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:30,496
The police gave bad information

839
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:35,104
It may have been good faith on their part which again is the point

840
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:40,224
Not sure doing any investigation into anything that is actually the root

841
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:42,272
Or fundamental

842
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:44,064
Surface-level b*******

843
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:50,720
People like Tucker and bd1 apresenta world where the mainstream media just makes up these stories out of thin air then reports them

844
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:53,536
Push their political agenda that's what people like Alex

845
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:55,072
So most of the rate with media does

846
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:57,632
However the reality is much more

847
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,960
There been an outburst of violence at the Capitol we're sick

848
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:01,728
Nick was on duty

849
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,032
Shortly after returning from

850
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,080
His brother has confirmed that

851
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:08,384
Picnic and told him that he was pepper-sprayed twice

852
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:10,688
Apparently he collapse

853
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:14,016
In the capital and they resuscitated him using CPR

854
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:16,576
The Capitol Police put out a press release that

855
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:18,880
He died of injuries that occurred on duty

856
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:22,464
Two law enforcement sources have provided information that was later determined

857
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,232
To be not good

858
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:24,768
But no one knew that at the

859
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:25,536
Time

860
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:29,888
It's complex how these things work and people like Tucker and Beatty want to simplify all that in

861
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:34,240
Easily digestible narratives or the media wanted to make Trump supporters look bad

862
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:35,264
So they made up

863
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,544
Conclusion about officers

864
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:37,568
Text app

865
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:44,224
If they wanted to have a real conversation it would be about how the media particularly the 24-hour news channels need to be a little more

866
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,808
Careful do not engage with the news that their report again

867
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:52,928
How it might be wise to try and maintain a little bit of journalistic distance from the subject that they're covering

868
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:54,208
If I was the only

869
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:56,000
We complained these dudes were making then

870
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:59,328
Can still f*** himself for the blood libel thing

871
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,352
But that also

872
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:03,424
Sections of the media have some room for improvement so let's move

873
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,472
Do a post-mortem on

874
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:06,240
The things

875
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:09,312
You could you got wrong that you could have done better on

876
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:10,336
Fine but don't

877
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:11,360
F****** pretended

878
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:13,664
It's this black-and-white nonsense

879
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:16,736
But and I'm going to throw this out at

880
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:19,296
Cuz I think this might be what

881
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:20,576
Really important

882
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:24,672
Which way is going to make you the most

883
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,232
Okay well then that's the way they're going to

884
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:30,560
Really shocked me here

885
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:34,400
Is it Darren Beattie didn't just call this Maga blood libel once

886
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:36,704
He said it twice in a matter of minutes

887
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:38,240
Clearly felt like an attempt

888
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:40,032
To enter a catchphrase

889
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:42,592
There is no no such they there is no fire

890
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:43,872
Which are involved at all

891
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:45,152
The paper is backpack

892
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:46,176
Admitting that it's

893
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:46,944
Possible

894
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,480
It was never even had it all

929
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:38,144
Weird deadly

930
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:41,472
Is a blood libel

931
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:42,752
Okay

932
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:46,592
So it's fair that the media Outlets like a time-saver tractor article

933
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:48,896
Included this information but

934
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:49,664
What to do when they go

935
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,456
Get things wrong it's actually a good sign

936
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:52,480
The sign of a

937
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:55,808
Journalistic Outlet

938
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,600
Media that they said

939
00:40:57,856 --> 00:41:01,440
Lies all the time they use a clip of them saying that Brian

940
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:02,208
Technique

941
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:02,976
Was

942
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:09,120
Correcting themselves remember how the media they say is lying to you

943
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:12,960
Also came out and said the thing that is not a lot

944
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:19,104
Track here is that he's trying to argue then taking credit for winning a

945
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,128
A completely separate

946
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:22,688
The determination did come down the sickness

947
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:27,808
Did not die as a result of injuries suffered on January 6th

948
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:29,344
Wasn't attacked

949
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:35,232
Cyclic told his brother that he was pepper sprayed multiple times passed out and had to be resuscitated with CPR

950
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,608
Experience may not have contributed to his death but he was the subject of considerable violence that day

951
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:43,424
I don't know what point you use Missouri winning other than

952
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:44,704
Cuz I was defiant

953
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,264
Just disagreed with

954
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,568
What people were saying and I ended up brand

955
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:52,384
Emily being right I mean they're trying to pin

956
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,919
Deadly mob as

957
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:55,967
Only being based on Brian six

958
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:57,503
As opposed to that

959
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:59,551
A lot of people died that day

960
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:03,903
So yeah that's that's the next point you can see here's the idea

961
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:05,695
To push that the coverage of the event

962
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:09,023
Is a Maga blood libel because it was based solely on the idea that

963
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:09,791
Sicnic it been

964
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:11,071
But like you

965
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:12,095
You bring up even that's bow

966
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:12,863
Bulshit

967
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:15,679
What may play the clips of the broadcasters calling the Bob

968
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:16,447
Murderous that's

969
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:17,471
Kind of Acura

970
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:19,007
The term murderous doesn't

971
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:20,031
Require that someone is

972
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:22,335
Committed murder just what they're capable other Dorsey

973
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:23,103
Seem to be intend

974
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:23,871
To murder

975
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:25,663
And I would say that a group of folks

976
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:26,431
Saint januarius

977
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:30,527
Qualify for that even if you just base it on the whole thing where they were chanting

978
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:34,623
Mike Pence that one is definitely murderous I would say just via

979
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:37,695
Existence of a regular old person holding

980
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:38,719
Plastic f***

981
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:39,999
Zip tie cuffs

982
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:41,791
Bats of murderous

983
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:44,095
Best thing to do I don't know

984
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:46,655
Never seen those specific cups

985
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:51,519
Used without like an intent to harm seriously I don't know

986
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:54,079
The mob was also absolutely dead

987
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:56,639
Kevin greeson died of a heart attack

988
00:42:57,151 --> 00:43:01,759
His wife told reporters that he suffered from high blood pressure and well I have no solid evidence

989
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:02,527
The basement song

990
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:05,855
The excitement and stress of the unfolding Riot could have easily raised

991
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:07,135
Is heart rate and blood pressure

992
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:10,463
And the same could be said for another person who died

993
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:11,487
Ben Phillips

994
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:14,047
Initially it was believed that Roseanne Boyland was

995
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:17,119
Trampled to death by a bunch of people who are trying to storm the building

996
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:21,471
Her friend who was there told reporters that was how she died because he was there and watched

997
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:22,239
Trampoline

998
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:28,895
When the medical examiner's report came back and turned out that she had actually died of accidental acute amphetamine intox

999
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:29,663
Application

1000
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:30,687
Ethan Ethan

1001
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:34,527
Instances are fairly loose in terms of where you might want to sign real response

1002
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:36,063
Sensibility about the deaths put

1003
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:37,599
It was a very deadly mob

1004
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:40,159
Honestly the only reason there were more deaths

1005
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:41,439
Probably dumb luck

1006
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:42,207
Coincidence

1007
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:43,231
Yeah I mean

1008
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:44,511
Maybe you'd like the

1009
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:46,303
The simplest thing that is

1010
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:47,839
So already in

1011
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:48,863
Infuriating about this

1012
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:50,911
Is the idea that we are

1013
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:53,727
Taking this all the way down to individual a

1014
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:55,519
Doctors at January 6th

1015
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:56,799
People

1016
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:59,103
Set up all of the circumstance

1017
00:43:59,359 --> 00:43:59,871
Necessary

1018
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:01,919
Brought all of those people there

1019
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:03,711
You know right well that's because

1020
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:06,271
That requires a mirror

1021
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:07,039
You got it

1022
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:08,319
Immediate needs

1023
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:10,367
Mixmaster called the event of January

1024
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:11,391
Deadly

1025
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:17,535
That's a false premise that's being put forward by Darren Beatty and Tucker in order to help them brand that reporting

1026
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:19,839
Anyway that's deeply offensive and

1027
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:24,447
Probably really popular with folks he hangs out with that the HL Mencken Club

1028
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:26,751
Yeah probably love that s*** hand they have

1029
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:28,031
To get together and laugh

1030
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:29,055
Evilly

1031
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:32,639
Whenever they use stuff whenever they use blood libel to apply to

1032
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:35,199
F******

1033
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:40,575
Cackling ghetto like an evil witches in a f****** that's cartoonish levels of evil

1034
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:42,111
It's gross

1035
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:43,135
So

1036
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:44,927
There's this

1037
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:46,463
Idea that there

1038
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:47,231
Kind of floating

1039
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:49,279
6

1040
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:50,047
Makes death

1041
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:53,887
And they're reporting around it and The Branding of everybody as

1042
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:56,191
Murderous deadly bloody people

1043
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:58,751
That's the whole reason

1044
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:00,287
The people were taking the event

1045
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:01,311
Of the six

1046
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:07,711
Seriously before getting arrested otherwise we should hang on some nonsense

1047
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:10,271
Innocent tourists just looking to find a little

1048
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:16,159
Memento from the Capitol building

1049
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:17,439
Just as not exist

1050
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:18,975
Mass destruction

1051
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:21,023
F*** you

1052
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:23,327
Folk music

1053
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:28,959
Ali Alexander

1054
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:32,287
After 9/11

1055
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:34,335
I spent my early adult

1056
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:35,615
Growing up in a

1057
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:36,895
Post 9/11

1058
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,175
Fun World with an Arab name

1059
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:40,991
It's open season on hate towards Muslims and Islam

1060
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:42,783
At one point in 2012

1061
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:44,575
Had to have a member of Congress

1062
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:46,879
Dfbguide get me removed

1063
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:47,903
From a

1064
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:49,183
Watchlist

1065
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:50,207
And now

1066
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:51,231
In this

1067
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:52,255
Post one

1068
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:54,303
I'm on a list

1069
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:55,071
Yet again

1070
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:57,119
Because I've been deemed

1071
00:45:57,631 --> 00:45:58,399
A minority

1072
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:01,727
So this is a really smart game with Tucker is playing

1073
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:06,847
You can easily demonstrate that there was an accurate early reporting about officer sickness

1074
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:08,383
Cause of death

1075
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:10,687
Be as big a deal as possible and

1076
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:12,735
Explanatory for everything

1077
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:14,015
Possibly make it

1078
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:15,039
Explanatory for

1079
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:20,415
That's why the game here is that the inaccurate reporting about sicnic is the reason that the folks

1080
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:23,487
Enforcement made it a priority to go after people involved in the Rye

1081
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:29,631
I can say with absolute confidence that if sicnic were alive today literally everything would have played out the same

1082
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:31,935
Just without the early inaccurate report

1083
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:35,519
The government doesn't need a cop dying to take the storming of the US

1084
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:37,311
Capital very seriously

1085
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:39,103
That's childish bulshit

1086
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:44,223
Yeah you have to be real dumb to believe this dumb s*** you have to be so

1087
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:46,271
F****** stupid to believe this

1088
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:52,159
Speaking of childish bullshitters Tucker's next expert on the documentary is former regular Alex Jones gas tank

1089
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:54,719
Complete lunatic and felon Ali Alexander

1090
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:57,023
We covered this on a past episode but just

1091
00:46:57,535 --> 00:46:58,303
Ricky's anyone

1092
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:00,351
Hear that before he got involved

1093
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:01,375
Republican politics

1094
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:03,935
Ali Akbar as he was then known got arrested

1095
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:04,703
4 quotes

1096
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:05,727
Stealing several items

1097
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:10,079
Fort Worth woman and later quote he broke into a van stole the debit card and attempt

1098
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:10,847
Did you use it

1099
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:15,199
He pled guilty debit card fraud and had to repay what he stole it got four years probation

1100
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:19,551
Everybody got involved in the McCain campaign at the local level in Dallas-Fort Worth

1101
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:22,367
I got some hot water there after he was accused of quote

1102
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:24,159
Endorsing voter fraud tact

1103
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:26,975
Alright seems a little familiar

1104
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:31,071
We talked a ton about Allie and how he's a Christian salad on a level that even

1105
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:31,839
Kind of doors

1106
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:32,863
Alex himself

1107
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:34,399
He's a complete lunatic

1108
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:35,679
And he was deeply involved

1109
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:37,215
Stop the steel campaign

1110
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:40,287
Itself grew out of the voter intimidation campaign that Rodger Stone

1111
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:42,079
Started for the 2016 election

1112
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:43,359
Also called stop this

1113
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:45,919
Trump won that election know so they didn't

1114
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:48,991
End up having to do much stuff that anyone would remember in that

1115
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:51,295
You know why this didn't happen next

1116
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:54,623
I don't want to rehash too much but Ally himself because honestly he's

1117
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:56,159
They're kind of pathetic but

1118
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:57,183
Very accomplished

1119
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:57,951
Scam artist

1120
00:47:58,463 --> 00:47:59,743
Only really need to know about it

1121
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:01,023
Like just to get us answers

1122
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:02,559
Caliber

1123
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:07,935
Is that he was the third wheel on Laura Loomer and Jacob wolves documentary where they went to Minnesota.

1124
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:10,495
Try and prove that a lot Omar was married to her brother

1125
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:18,175
You do got to give him some credit for going straight

1126
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:21,247
From debit card fraud to stealing election

1127
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:23,807
Tough to do a little bit of

1128
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:30,207
The transitional period to it some other other scams

1129
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:31,487
Allegedly

1130
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:38,143
What I do find interesting here is how Tucker is using alley to express this feeling of being singled out in Moline because he

1131
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:39,167
We had an Arab name

1132
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:41,215
Is Tucker recognized

1133
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:43,263
But his professional activities director

1134
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:45,311
Contributed to the difficulty Ali had

1135
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:46,335
In those years

1136
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:50,175
Tucker was Pro Iraq war and then decided it was a bad idea to

1137
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:50,943
Conveyed

1138
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:54,783
However he didn't think it was a bad idea because war is a bad idea

1139
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:59,647
In a 2008 recording of an appearance he made on the radio show hosted by Bubba the Love Sponge

1140
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:00,927
Tucker said quote

1141
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:05,279
Iraq is a crappy place filled with a bunch of you know semi-literate primitive monkeys

1142
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:07,327
That's why it wasn't worth invading

1143
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:11,423
It wasn't an opposition to war that turned Tucker against the Iraq war is a Feeling

1144
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:13,727
The people of Iraq were less than human which is

1145
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:16,287
Definitely part of the mentality that led folks

1146
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:18,079
To look at all Muslims

1147
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:19,871
InFocus Arabic sounding names

1148
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:20,895
Suspicious unless

1149
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:21,663
Inhuman

1150
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:23,967
Another clip from 2,000

1151
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:24,991
6 included

1152
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:29,343
Tucker talking about how is a Democratic candidate in the 2008 election came out and promise to

1153
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:30,879
To kill as many quote

1154
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:32,671
Lunatic Muslims as they could

1155
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:33,695
They would quotes

1156
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:35,999
King and the Tucker would vote for the

1157
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:37,535
This hypothetical

1158
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:39,327
Candidate would need to have the right kind of message

1159
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:41,887
Quote I think you mean to say look

1160
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:44,191
I'm a bigot okay I'm a bigot I don't like it

1161
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:45,727
Islamic extremists

1162
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:51,615
Like if you're really heavily into Islam I really I'm sorry I just don't I don't care for you that much

1163
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:52,895
And I don't care what that sounds

1164
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:54,943
Like you can call me a racist you can call me whatever the

1165
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:55,711
F*** you want

1166
00:49:56,735 --> 00:50:02,879
Tuckerman Auto money of being a part of the problem that Alexander is now on a Tucker Carlson documentary complaining about

1167
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:03,647
But the blame is

1168
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:06,975
Solely on other people these people just a f****** pack a loser

1169
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:09,023
It's nonsense

1170
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:09,791
Yeah

1171
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:13,631
See why I hate this s*** easy to be good

1172
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:14,399
Stuff

1173
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:15,935
These guys

1174
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:18,751
Would not be right-wing loon

1175
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:20,031
Text right it's

1176
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:21,055
Zoe

1177
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:21,823
Easy

1178
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:23,359
To do this s***

1179
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:29,759
Yeah the bar the bar of Entry is not high to do good work you don't go anywhere near

1180
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:32,319
You kind of

1181
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:35,135
I think generally have a scent

1182
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:39,487
That doing so will impede your ability to do good work later

1183
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:46,399
You might reach some really high heights but you also probably going to go to jail

1184
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:47,423
Tucker Carlson

1185
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:48,447
I mean

1186
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:51,775
Look he can't be happy with this Cami like Siri

1187
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:52,799
You gets great ratings

1188
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:53,567
AMC

1189
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:54,591
Gets people

1190
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:55,615
To be mad at him

1191
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:56,895
He makes a lot of money

1192
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:57,919
But

1193
00:50:58,687 --> 00:50:59,199
I don't know it

1194
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:01,247
It seems like a boring in life

1195
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:02,271
Why why

1196
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:05,087
You do it just being a psychopath for

1197
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:07,135
But you know you don't even have fun

1198
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:10,719
Ali is a huge liar and I gave him

1199
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:12,255
Imply

1200
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:15,583
Bastille what's the most law-abiding movement

1201
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:17,375
That this country has seen in modern

1202
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:21,727
None of the stop

1203
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:22,495
He'll rally

1204
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:24,287
Police report

1205
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:29,407
I think that's why we had

1206
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:33,759
Conspiracy

1207
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:38,623
So that last one was a crystal ball one of the House of rising on the Hilti

1208
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:39,391
TV

1209
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:45,791
Avis Clippers play to somehow meant to imply that she was supportive of stop Bastille efforts that Ali was engaging in or that in

1210
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:48,351
Larger picture there was stealing in the election

1211
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:51,423
She actually said about alley in.

1212
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:52,191
Bastille

1213
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:53,983
I could have made this radar

1214
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:56,543
Because of that

1215
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:57,311
Additional reporting

1216
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:58,591
Gonzales

1217
00:51:58,847 --> 00:51:59,615
About how much of

1218
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:00,639
The money in the hole

1219
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:01,407
Stop this.

1220
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:03,711
Amount of it

1221
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:04,991
Ashley went to any

1222
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:05,759
Sort of like

1223
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:07,295
Legal efforts are Alexa

1224
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:09,343
Obviously I think

1225
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:11,135
Election fraud

1226
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:12,927
Oh okay

1227
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:13,951
So okay

1228
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:15,999
So is she

1229
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:17,535
Man I'm guessing that you would

1230
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:21,887
Like to be used that is this documentary

1231
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:22,911
That is

1232
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:23,679
It's just on

1233
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:28,031
I don't appreciate it

1234
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:30,335
Let's glow lovable

1235
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:34,175
Play kicking a leaf eligible owed

1236
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:35,967
Clip of hers

1237
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:41,599
Those are from two different broadcast for crystal balls

1238
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:42,623
Clear light come on

1239
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:49,279
That's just cruel very specific examples

1240
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:55,167
I just liked it I was able to very easily find a clip of her literally saying stop

1241
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:56,703
Steelers bowls

1242
00:52:57,215 --> 00:53:01,055
Anyway d-clip Tucker is playing to reinforce this idea that Ali Alexander

1243
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:02,847
Stop a steel shed had bipartisan

1244
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:05,663
Computers from Crystal Ball talking about the Democratic Party

1245
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:06,431
Handling

1246
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:07,455
I'll be Iowa caucus

1247
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:10,015
There absolutely was no by party

1248
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:11,039
Some support.

1249
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:12,575
Castillo ladany meaningful way

1250
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:16,927
Also about that whole thing about no police reports being filed it stopped

1251
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:17,951
Does the O'Reilly's

1252
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:24,351
What about that one in December 2020 were four people were stabbed and quote at least 33 people were arrested

1253
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:26,655
There was a woman arrest

1254
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:32,543
Super result today November 2020 stop the steel rally in the Idaho at the Idaho State Capitol

1255
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:38,687
A man was arrested for tearing a woman's mask off at a November 2020 stop Bastille rally in Pensacola

1256
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:44,831
That assault was actually caught on tape and went around social media so Allie should probably know that people are aware of that one

1257
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:51,231
4 people arrested one of them for spraying Mason the face of a legal Observer from the national lawyers Guild

1258
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:54,815
At 8 November 2020 stop at the O'Reilly in Salem Oregon

1259
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:57,631
We could go on I'm sure there are more but I think

1260
00:53:57,887 --> 00:53:58,399
The point is clear

1261
00:53:58,911 --> 00:54:00,959
There's been plenty of police reports in arrested

1262
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:01,983
Ixtapa steel rally

1263
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:05,823
Saying that their work because it makes him feel better

1264
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:08,383
That's the case and as an added bonus

1265
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:10,943
It allows him to continue his woe-is-me act

1266
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:11,967
Steph is all bunch

1267
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:12,991
F****** horseshit

1268
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:15,039
I I do

1269
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:16,063
Love

1270
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:17,343
I do love

1271
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:19,647
The unironically use

1272
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:21,183
Of a crowd

1273
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:22,463
Chanting Christ

1274
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:25,535
Is king that's a way to

1275
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:27,327
To prove that they're non-violent

1276
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:29,631
Right like historically

1277
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:31,935
A large group of white people chanting Christ

1278
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:34,239
Texas King leads to black people dying

1279
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:35,007
Every time

1280
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:41,151
Not just about the Crusades

1281
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:43,711
Absolutely

1282
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:46,527
In Latin

1283
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:48,063
So I

1284
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:49,343
Fix-It one of the point

1285
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:53,439
I will I will build my house

1286
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:56,255
Liar

1287
00:54:56,511 --> 00:54:57,279
Here's Appliance

1288
00:54:58,303 --> 00:55:01,887
I will coordinate the US Capitol Police nearly every day a lot of

1289
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:06,751
People don't know that. If you actually had a permit

1290
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:09,055
Capital Plaza

1291
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:11,359
Grounds latte we had

1292
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:12,383
Permit

1293
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:20,575
20 to 50,000 people inside the president's Park sitting there at the very front I'm dead center

1294
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:21,343
The president

1295
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:22,367
Route

1296
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:24,671
A trump campaign staffer walked

1297
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:27,487
Me and says only there are people leaving the over

1298
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:30,815
And they're already 10,000

1299
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:34,143
People at the US Capitol with your presence

1300
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:35,935
And the present of Alex Jones

1301
00:55:36,191 --> 00:55:42,335
Why don't you guys walk down Pennsylvania gather people together

1302
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:44,895
Positioning for your Valley on W 8th

1303
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:47,455
Our boy got a little bit of a cameo

1304
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:54,111
Stop the steel didn't have a permit for the use of area 8 of the Capitol grounds on January 6th

1305
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:55,903
An event called what

1306
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:57,183
Nation under God

1307
00:55:57,439 --> 00:55:59,487
Have been granted a permit to have a rally with

1308
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:01,279
50 or less at MBS

1309
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:02,303
On area at

1310
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:07,679
That day they had a permit it was all totally legal this permit was

1311
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:13,311
Thought almost certainly because Ali knew fully well that he would never be able to get a permit himself

1312
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:15,103
Stop the steel rally

1313
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:16,127
Never be approved

1314
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:19,199
Sent to the limit for a permit on that lawn it's 50 people

1315
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:23,039
It stands to reason that Ali had used a dummy organization

1316
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:25,599
Get a permitted spot where you could then do a

1317
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:26,367
Pop up stopper

1318
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:27,135
Steel rally

1319
00:56:27,903 --> 00:56:29,951
Amy permit application itself

1320
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:32,255
Fascinating things

1321
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:38,911
Since in the report filed by the capital coordinator he documents his conversation with the organizer of the event

1322
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:39,935
Steven Brown

1323
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:41,215
And says quote

1324
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:45,055
Purpose of his event does not give me any idea of what he wants to bring

1325
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:47,615
Attention to other than it's a First Amendment.

1326
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:48,383
Menstration

1327
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:49,919
Weird

1328
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:52,223
Initially they want to be largest

1329
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:54,271
It's closer to the Capitol building itself

1330
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:55,295
Area 9

1331
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:56,575
But it was already claimed

1332
00:56:57,087 --> 00:56:59,135
They were offered space on the other side of the building

1333
00:56:59,391 --> 00:57:00,927
Decided not to take it because they work

1334
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:04,255
Convinced that women for America First was going to have a rally over there

1335
00:57:04,511 --> 00:57:07,839
And I didn't want to mix it up with them because apparently they don't like them so they took the

1336
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:08,607
Smaller lot

1337
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:10,143
Number 8

1338
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:13,727
From what I've seen women for America First is very confrontational

1339
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:17,567
Communicating with brown decor

1340
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:19,871
Later started to notice a heavy overlapping

1341
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:21,919
This proposed

1342
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:24,223
I explained it

1343
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:30,623
Here's that stopped the steel in one nation under God is one in the same due to the similarities in affiliation with Allie Alexander

1344
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:32,671
I advised mr. Brown of Micah

1345
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:36,511
Concerns of not being able to regulate their numbers to 50 persons or less

1346
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:37,791
If his event is it

1347
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:41,887
In fact one in the same Capitol Police will not be able to accommodate his event

1348
00:57:42,143 --> 00:57:44,447
Due to the participant number being out of Regulation

1349
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:46,495
Any public safety issue

1350
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:50,847
Her mr. Brown he communicated all the rules with his group to include the 5th

1351
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:52,127
Persons or less

1352
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:54,687
And they're aware that they have to keep their numbers regulated

1353
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:55,711
50 person

1354
00:57:56,479 --> 00:58:02,623
You get a pretty strong sense that what was going on is a bit shady and if I had to make a bet I would say that Ali and the folk

1355
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:06,719
Books with one nation under God that that rally are lying to the Capitol Police

1356
00:58:06,975 --> 00:58:09,535
It's an order to have a permit for a rally

1357
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:10,815
I was going to get out of control

1358
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:13,119
Even if the capitol hadn't been storm

1359
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:16,703
And if Ali's rally had attracted the crowd that he was clearly planning for

1360
00:58:17,215 --> 00:58:19,007
The Capitol Police would have been overwhelmed it would have

1361
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:20,031
Turn ugly

1362
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:22,591
There's there is clear in the

1363
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:23,615
Fusions of

1364
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:24,639
Moline

1365
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:26,687
I mean it was

1366
00:58:26,943 --> 00:58:33,087
Was kind of obvious when on the permit application they would like to understand any to be fifty persons or less he said yes and

1367
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:34,111
And then...

1368
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:37,695
Mwahahahaha

1369
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:38,975
Erica permit

1370
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:41,279
Area where they're allowed to have

1371
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:42,815
50% or less than even

1372
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:44,095
Before the capital of storm

1373
00:58:44,351 --> 00:58:48,191
Cukur saying that they're leading 15 20000 people

1374
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:49,215
Like

1375
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:54,079
There is absolutely no way that this is in keeping with the terms

1376
00:58:55,103 --> 00:58:55,615
If you walk

1377
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:58,431
If you look at the capital coordinator stuff

1378
00:58:58,943 --> 00:59:01,759
They are talking about how they will not be able to

1379
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:06,111
Uphold their end of the bargain and it will be a public safety issue

1380
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:08,159
That is kind of funny that

1381
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:11,487
Even on the documentary he's admitting to a crime

1382
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:21,727
To the permit office

1383
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:24,031
Shady ass liar

1384
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:25,311
Details of the permit application

1385
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:26,079
Process

1386
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:29,919
It's a little bit stronger that he was planning chaos in advance

1387
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:35,295
It's just a particular sort of chaos that ended up happening wasn't the type that he was looking

1388
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:43,231
Sideways it's made us look bad and so now we have to make this shity documentary it's all

1389
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:44,511
Love your fault

1390
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:47,327
Another kind of chaos we were looking

1391
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:50,911
Looking for come on

1392
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:52,703
I do appreciate

1393
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:55,775
Tucker Carlson really rolling them.

1394
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:57,055
Because

1395
00:59:57,311 --> 00:59:58,591
He's going for

1396
00:59:58,847 --> 01:00:00,127
Like like what's happened

1397
01:00:00,383 --> 01:00:06,527
And here is embarrassing they're trying to incite another overthrow the country

1398
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:08,831
No other way to put it they wanted to overthrow the United

1399
01:00:10,879 --> 01:00:11,647
But it but I'm

1400
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:14,975
Tucker's got to look at himself and realize

1401
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:15,743
Bright light

1402
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:18,047
I'm not going to be robes

1403
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:20,607
Like in the terror

1404
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:23,679
You know like he's got he's going up against the wall

1405
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:29,311
On his third glass of scotch at Whiskey fast he's sitting there and he's thinking

1406
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:36,223
I could have been somebody but I f*** it made a documentary where I'm treating Ali Alexander like a serious person

1407
01:00:36,479 --> 01:00:37,503
Fog God

1408
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:41,599
Give me another Scott party I'm going to go to the seminar

1409
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:45,183
Do you think your inciting the revolution doesn't mean you're going to live through a buddy

1410
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:45,951
Holy

1411
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:49,535
I have a tough time

1412
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:50,303
Think about like

1413
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:53,375
You know what you're saying I could have time to Insight another

1414
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:55,167
Event like January 6th

1415
01:00:55,423 --> 01:00:57,727
Solarium shirt there's there's definitely

1416
01:00:57,983 --> 01:00:58,495
Incitement

1417
01:00:58,751 --> 01:00:59,775
Towards something that

1418
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:02,079
It's being done by most of the right-wing media

1419
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:05,407
This overwhelming sense of

1420
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:07,711
Watch this

1421
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:09,503
Like I get bummed out

1422
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:15,135
I get bummed out by seeing people like Ali Alexander with like good

1423
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:17,695
Production value

1424
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:18,975
YouTube

1425
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:20,511
Tik-Tok video completo

1426
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:21,279
Totally

1427
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:25,119
You shouldn't be the camera that

1428
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:26,399
Films

1429
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:27,167
Is worth

1430
01:01:27,423 --> 01:01:29,471
10 to $20,000

1431
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:34,079
Betsy investment going into the lies you are telling me

1432
01:01:34,335 --> 01:01:36,127
What's actually being dumb

1433
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:37,407
The content is just so

1434
01:01:37,663 --> 01:01:38,431
Bad

1435
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:40,223
Apparently bad

1436
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:44,319
Like I don't believe that the people who made this one keenly aware that.

1437
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:45,343
They have to

1438
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:46,111
If you work

1439
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:47,135
Get Fox Nation

1440
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:47,903
Making a

1441
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:49,951
Tucker documentary

1442
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:51,231
You have to know what

1443
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:56,863
I can't believe that anybody who would be aware enough of Ali Alexander

1444
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:58,399
To put him in a documentary

1445
01:01:58,655 --> 01:02:01,471
Wouldn't also be aware of what a shady liar here

1446
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:08,383
And they chose to put them in anyway so

1447
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:09,407
He's going to get all the concert

1448
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:14,015
Going to pretend that we were against them the whole f****** time

1449
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:15,295
The question

1450
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:16,575
So

1451
01:02:17,087 --> 01:02:18,623
Being a real Atlanta suspect

1452
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:19,647
Really fast

1453
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:21,439
Call 911

1454
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:22,463
Sure

1455
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:27,583
Why don't they why do they know who the Mastermind of this one was because they didn't clearly announcement

1456
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:30,911
Some of the

1457
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:32,191
Some of the key sets

1458
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:33,471
Come to mind,

1459
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:37,055
Adidas

1460
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:38,847
Murrah Federal Building

1461
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:41,407
Oklahoma City

1462
01:02:43,711 --> 01:02:45,503
It has been the better part of a year

1463
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:47,807
And The Mastermind

1464
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:48,831
This supposed

1465
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:51,647
Have never been fat

1466
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:56,511
Then who did

1467
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:59,583
Tucker's asking a question he was based on a false premise

1468
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:06,239
The basic idea is that if he gets erection wasn't planned by Ali and stop Bastille it must have been planned by someone and because the

1469
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:07,519
Suspect

1470
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:11,103
As fast as the cases of Oklahoma City and 9/11

1471
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:16,479
You know who it's sufficient that we don't have to Mastermind

1472
01:03:16,735 --> 01:03:19,551
Anyone within 20 minutes the guy said

1473
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:21,599
I don't know let him go

1474
01:03:21,855 --> 01:03:22,879
See how it goes

1475
01:03:23,135 --> 01:03:26,207
Whole thing is dumb for a number of reasons

1476
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:30,559
First being that there doesn't need to be a mastermind behind the events of the 6th

1477
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:34,911
In order for there to be loads of coordination of little things that were the sort of things

1478
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:36,703
Attempt to lead to a huge problem

1479
01:03:36,959 --> 01:03:39,519
Mixed in with some things that might have been accidental Orca win

1480
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:41,055
Princeton

1481
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:43,103
Ali and his group having a permit

1482
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:44,639
Specifically for an area meant for

1483
01:03:44,895 --> 01:03:48,223
450 or less people when he's trying to bring thousands to the Capitol

1484
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:49,759
Bad planning

1485
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:53,855
Because at the s******* like Ali I'm not going to give him the benefit of the doubt

1486
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:57,439
I bet you didn't know that more than 50 people would show up

1487
01:03:57,695 --> 01:03:59,743
I believe that his actions definitely or at least

1488
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:02,047
Intentionally severely irresponsible

1489
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:06,911
Conversely I would be willing to bet that Trump saying in his speech that everyone

1490
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:09,215
Want to go to the Capitol and he was going to go with them

1491
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:10,751
That might not have been playing

1492
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:12,799
Happy access

1493
01:04:13,055 --> 01:04:14,847
And for the people who wanted s*** to get out of hand

1494
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:20,223
So that when Congress so was it was there they wouldn't be able to certify the electoral vote even better

1495
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:23,551
Congress members would see the chaos and be intimidated into not

1496
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:27,135
Again we found suspect number one

1497
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:28,415
The moment it has

1498
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:35,071
Also Osama Bin Laden was a huge suspect immediately after 9/11 cuz he's already bomb that

1499
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:40,191
A building and he said he was going to do it again was really easy to figure out

1500
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:41,471
Pretty easy because

1501
01:04:41,727 --> 01:04:47,871
Police found a rear axle of the Ryder truck that have been rented by McVeigh to do the bombing so that was a pretty fast lead

1502
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:51,711
Tucker says that McVeigh was arrested within 48 Hours of the bombing but

1503
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:53,247
He was actually arrested

1504
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:56,063
For the night when he was pulled over for not having tags on his car

1505
01:04:56,319 --> 01:04:56,831
And also for

1506
01:04:57,855 --> 01:04:58,367
BB gun

1507
01:04:58,623 --> 01:05:03,999
Take a little longer for them to figure out that he was a suspect in the bombing but when they did he was already in custody

1508
01:05:04,255 --> 01:05:05,791
Have they found Terry Nichols because he

1509
01:05:06,047 --> 01:05:06,815
He gave Terry Nichols

1510
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:08,351
Brothers address

1511
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:09,887
Police what is a prism

1512
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:11,167
And maybe Bill Cooper

1513
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:15,263
The guy who knows I would agree though that

1514
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:18,335
Pretty scary that the FBI has been identified the person or the

1515
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:19,103
Dakota Coronavirus

1516
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:20,383
Mastermind who planted bombs

1517
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:22,431
The DNC and RNC headquarters yet

1518
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:25,503
But I'm not sure if that helps Tucker's case at all so I'm going to

1519
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:26,527
We go ahead and

1520
01:05:26,783 --> 01:05:27,807
Call that one APUSH

1521
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:28,575
Yeah let's

1522
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:29,855
Sleep that one out

1523
01:05:30,879 --> 01:05:31,903
So obviously

1524
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:33,951
Agent provocateur

1525
01:05:34,207 --> 01:05:34,719
You're right

1526
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:36,511
I mean I've got to be a big piece of the

1527
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:37,791
Conspiracy

1528
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:41,119
Not the end the people who did it where the people that they

1529
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:42,143
That

1530
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:45,215
So it's got to be a jumper box

1531
01:05:45,727 --> 01:05:47,007
Pretending to be people

1532
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:48,287
That we say that they did

1533
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:51,103
In order to frame the people who didn't do it

1534
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:53,407
The people who are so peacefully

1535
01:05:53,663 --> 01:05:54,943
Chanting crisis King

1536
01:05:56,479 --> 01:05:58,271
Agent provocateurs baby

1537
01:05:59,039 --> 01:05:59,807
Alexander

1538
01:06:03,647 --> 01:06:04,415
Then who did

1539
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:07,743
Co-conspirators

1540
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:09,791
Route middle-aged

1541
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:11,839
Journalist Elijah Schaffer

1542
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:13,119
Casino

1543
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:14,655
The election

1544
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:23,359
Revisit

1545
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:24,639
January 6th

1546
01:06:24,895 --> 01:06:28,479
Who were mad about what they saw to be an election

1547
01:06:28,991 --> 01:06:31,039
50 Cent was unfair rig fortified

1548
01:06:31,295 --> 01:06:32,831
It doesn't matter what you say it is

1549
01:06:33,087 --> 01:06:34,623
They were just angry and a lot of them just got

1550
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:36,415
Caught up in the front lines of Chaos

1551
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:38,207
Oh my God

1552
01:06:41,535 --> 01:06:44,351
The game maybe

1553
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:48,191
Getting out of control

1554
01:06:48,447 --> 01:06:50,495
During 2020 Riders

1555
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:51,263
Cosmoprof

1556
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:52,799
Three billion dollars with a damaging

1557
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:54,847
Until about two dozen people over the course

1558
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:56,895
8 months versus David Dorn

1559
01:06:57,151 --> 01:06:58,431
And is very last moments

1560
01:06:58,687 --> 01:06:59,199
On Earth

1561
01:06:59,455 --> 01:06:59,967
He's a foreman

1562
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:00,735
Police captain

1563
01:07:01,759 --> 01:07:05,599
Store treated Riders

1564
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:06,879
That were left wing

1565
01:07:07,647 --> 01:07:08,159
Kamala Harris

1566
01:07:08,415 --> 01:07:08,927
Twerking help

1567
01:07:09,183 --> 01:07:09,695
Instigator

1568
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:10,719
Criminal

1569
01:07:10,975 --> 01:07:15,839
Giving the narrative that yours no consequences for acts of violence even on federal ground

1570
01:07:16,095 --> 01:07:21,471
Cases being dropped from the federal Siege and Portland by leftist writers I believe that's part of sending a narrative

1571
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:23,263
Gas like the right-wing

1572
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:25,823
Into thinking that they could Riot to and get away with it

1573
01:07:26,591 --> 01:07:29,151
So you can see how I hear how this documentary itself isn't

1574
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:30,431
Internally inconsistent

1575
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:31,711
In terms of the point it's trying

1576
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:33,759
How to make Tucker intros dissection

1577
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:34,783
I'm clearly implying

1578
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:37,087
People who were responsible for the riot we're agents

1579
01:07:37,343 --> 01:07:38,111
Provocateur

1580
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:41,183
A comments make no sense in that context

1581
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:48,095
Elijah saying that these were moms and dads were gas-lit by the media into thinking that they could write and get away with it because the left

1582
01:07:48,863 --> 01:07:51,167
That would imply that these moms and dads did riot

1583
01:07:51,423 --> 01:07:51,935
Probably

1584
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:53,727
So because they thought they

1585
01:07:53,983 --> 01:07:55,007
I could get away with it

1586
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:56,031
What's the time

1587
01:07:56,287 --> 01:07:58,079
Left doesn't get in trouble so why should they

1588
01:07:58,591 --> 01:08:00,383
This is how a child thing

1589
01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:07,039
Documentary that says I'm rubber you're glue

1590
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:08,063
You say about me

1591
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:14,719
The members of his political Community to this extent

1592
01:08:15,487 --> 01:08:17,279
It doesn't look good

1593
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:19,071
Even sort of

1594
01:08:19,327 --> 01:08:22,143
In contrast to the earlier presentations

1595
01:08:22,655 --> 01:08:27,519
That was being made in this documentary that this is all overblown and the blood libel against

1596
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:33,663
Text Maga and now there's agent-provocateur so there was bad things

1597
01:08:35,455 --> 01:08:37,759
You wouldn't have agent provocateurs if she didn't get

1598
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:39,807
Pretty out of hand a bad f****** things happen

1599
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:40,831
Yeah I mean

1600
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:47,231
I feel like an interview with a trump supporter saying we came here to show them that we mean business does not

1601
01:08:47,487 --> 01:08:47,999
Support his

1602
01:08:48,255 --> 01:08:49,279
Conclusion that they were

1603
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:52,351
All just out there for a month

1604
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:54,655
Yeah I don't I don't think you have

1605
01:08:54,911 --> 01:08:55,423
Have agent

1606
01:08:57,983 --> 01:09:00,799
Who carry out their work and then like the result is like

1607
01:09:01,567 --> 01:09:02,335
Nothing really have

1608
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:04,895
Usually usually bad things

1609
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:06,175
Are the result of

1610
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:07,455
Provocateur

1611
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:08,735
Explain to me

1612
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:10,271
How will provoke

1613
01:09:10,527 --> 01:09:11,039
Couture

1614
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:12,575
Gets a

1615
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:13,855
Crowd of thousands

1616
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:17,951
Do something that they instinctively don't want to do

1617
01:09:18,207 --> 01:09:19,487
On account of them screaming Christ

1618
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:20,767
And you

1619
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:24,095
There's an agent provocateur

1620
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:25,119
Sure

1621
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:27,935
That person has malicious

1622
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:29,471
Make this argument if you actually want me

1623
01:09:29,727 --> 01:09:30,239
Me too

1624
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:33,055
It would beat the way that they would do it would be to like

1625
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:35,871
Attack the police so the police gas the crowd or something

1626
01:09:36,127 --> 01:09:38,175
Like that and that met Angela proud enough

1627
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:39,199
Turn off the fan.

1628
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:39,967
Daniela

1629
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:45,087
That would be the argument that would be made

1630
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:46,623
Shockingly without evidence

1631
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:48,415
The evidence is hard

1632
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:52,511
So also Portland is a part of Multnomah County in Orem

1633
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:54,303
The Multnomah District

1634
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:56,095
Attorney's office has a dashboard

1635
01:09:56,351 --> 01:09:58,399
Taxi protests related cases that they've handled

1636
01:09:58,911 --> 01:10:00,447
Nov 1108

1637
01:10:00,703 --> 01:10:03,775
Eight cases that were referred to their office 197 or accept

1638
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:04,543
The prosecutor

1639
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:08,127
Of the 894 cases that were rejected

1640
01:10:08,383 --> 01:10:10,431
881 of them were public order

1641
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:11,711
Switcher

1642
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:12,991
Pissant nonsense

1643
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:15,295
Conversely of the person cry

1644
01:10:15,807 --> 01:10:19,135
69 out of 180 one of those cases were accepted with night

1645
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:20,159
18 also

1646
01:10:20,415 --> 01:10:20,927
Additional

1647
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:23,231
Facing the possible charges later

1648
01:10:23,743 --> 01:10:26,303
In 45 additional cases being rejected due to

1649
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:27,327
Efficient evidence

1650
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:31,167
I couldn't get a charge on

1651
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:32,959
Her property

1652
01:10:33,215 --> 01:10:36,543
Crimes 81 out of 135 cases were accepted

1653
01:10:37,055 --> 01:10:38,847
In 21 out of 33 weapons

1654
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:39,871
Grimes Works after

1655
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:40,639
Deferred prosecution

1656
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:42,943
The comment Elijah made was

1657
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:44,991
Specifically about Portland but really he's trying

1658
01:10:45,247 --> 01:10:48,831
End point a finger at all the protests from last year in the wake of the George Floyd killing

1659
01:10:49,343 --> 01:10:50,623
The Narrative that's

1660
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:51,647
Perpetuated by right way

1661
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:53,951
Is that the right one quote

1662
01:10:54,207 --> 01:10:56,767
Get in trouble for stuff that the left-wing folks get away with

1663
01:10:57,535 --> 01:10:58,303
Sexually complete bulshit

1664
01:10:59,327 --> 01:11:02,655
An AP analysis of over 300 Federal cases that resulted

1665
01:11:02,911 --> 01:11:03,679
Incidents connected

1666
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:04,959
The George Floyd protest

1667
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:05,983
Quote

1668
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:07,519
More than 120

1669
01:11:07,775 --> 01:11:10,335
I need to find dance across the United States of pleaded guilty

1670
01:11:10,591 --> 01:11:14,175
Or were convicted at trial of federal crimes including rioting Orson

1671
01:11:14,943 --> 01:11:15,455
Conspiracy

1672
01:11:15,711 --> 01:11:20,319
More than 70 defendants have been sentenced so far have gotten an average of about 27 month

1673
01:11:20,575 --> 01:11:21,343
Behind Bars

1674
01:11:21,599 --> 01:11:22,111
At least

1675
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:23,135
Can receive

1676
01:11:23,391 --> 01:11:24,671
In terms of five years or more

1677
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:27,231
The same sort of phenomenon is probably what your

1678
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:28,511
You're going to end up seeing

1679
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:30,559
The relation to folks

1680
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:31,583
Put the January 6th

1681
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:32,351
Reese's

1682
01:11:32,607 --> 01:11:36,447
There may be a lot of folks who get arrested but a whole lot of them are going to have their charge

1683
01:11:36,703 --> 01:11:39,775
Just dropped and they'll be cut very generous deals where they plead guilty

1684
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:43,615
Do some nonsense misdemeanor and then they end up doing no jail time

1685
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:44,895
That's what's going to happen

1686
01:11:45,407 --> 01:11:48,479
Little people who made me broke the windows of the capital or

1687
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:49,503
Did

1688
01:11:49,759 --> 01:11:51,039
Do things like hit cops

1689
01:11:51,295 --> 01:11:53,599
BMW going to jail for a while

1690
01:11:53,855 --> 01:11:54,623
Could happen

1691
01:11:55,135 --> 01:11:56,415
Three important thing here

1692
01:11:56,927 --> 01:11:58,463
Is is how the right wing

1693
01:11:58,719 --> 01:11:59,743
Media propagandists

1694
01:11:59,999 --> 01:12:01,023
Their mind work

1695
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:01,791
Works how it works

1696
01:12:02,559 --> 01:12:05,887
Summerlake Elijah Schaffer of Glenn Beck's Blaze Network

1697
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:07,935
Everyone on the left who was protesting didn't

1698
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:08,959
Didn't get in any trouble

1699
01:12:09,471 --> 01:12:10,751
That story is real

1700
01:12:11,519 --> 01:12:13,055
Feels real and it makes it

1701
01:12:13,311 --> 01:12:13,823
Mad

1702
01:12:14,335 --> 01:12:14,847
It's not real

1703
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:21,247
The anger is real and it's the massive part of the right-wing persecution complex which Eliza Elijah uses

1704
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:22,271
Make a ton of money

1705
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:24,319
Not connected to reality

1706
01:12:25,087 --> 01:12:25,599
They don't do

1707
01:12:25,855 --> 01:12:26,623
Follow-up work

1708
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:27,391
And check to see if

1709
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:30,975
Any of the people on the left-wing who were arrested got charged

1710
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:31,999
Because if they did

1711
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:35,583
The fact that the profitable and satisfying anger that they use

1712
01:12:36,095 --> 01:12:36,607
Is Ally

1713
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:38,655
Taper with total

1714
01:12:38,911 --> 01:12:40,447
In the capital he was just on the

1715
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:43,007
Capitol on January 6th

1716
01:12:43,519 --> 01:12:47,615
He was the guy who tweeted out a picture of Nancy Pelosi's open laptop on her desk

1717
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:48,639
With the comment quote

1718
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:49,407
Breaking

1719
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:54,527
I'm inside Nancy Pelosi's office with the thousands of revolutionaries who have stormed the building

1720
01:12:55,551 --> 01:12:56,831
I guess the question I'm left with

1721
01:12:57,343 --> 01:13:03,231
Cuz if the people store in the capital that they were revolutionaries or if they were moms and dads who got caught up in the excitement

1722
01:13:03,487 --> 01:13:05,023
I don't know if Elijah knows the

1723
01:13:06,303 --> 01:13:12,447
Motherfuking loser in this documentary I hate these people goddamn this is really really bad

1724
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:14,239
This is really really infuriating

1725
01:13:15,775 --> 01:13:16,543
That's that's

1726
01:13:16,799 --> 01:13:17,311
F******

1727
01:13:17,823 --> 01:13:18,847
Blue Boy

1728
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:20,383
Laughable I mean that's

1729
01:13:20,895 --> 01:13:22,175
So f****** easy

1730
01:13:22,943 --> 01:13:24,223
It's so easy and it works

1731
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:25,759
It's so easy that work

1732
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:26,783
It's because people

1733
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:32,159
Will instantly hear a bunch of middle-aged white people chanting crisis King and go

1734
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:33,183
They can't be bad

1735
01:13:33,695 --> 01:13:39,583
The only thing

1736
01:13:40,607 --> 01:13:41,887
Ceiling

1737
01:13:42,143 --> 01:13:42,911
That is

1738
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:43,679
Attractive

1739
01:13:43,935 --> 01:13:44,959
And what makes this word

1740
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:48,287
Feels like these left-wing protesters

1741
01:13:48,543 --> 01:13:51,615
Never get in trouble if I stay that way

1742
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:53,663
If I say that I feel good

1743
01:13:53,919 --> 01:13:56,479
If I look it up and I'm not right

1744
01:13:56,735 --> 01:13:57,247
I feel

1745
01:13:57,503 --> 01:13:58,783
Back feels good

1746
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:03,647
Police reports Everett estopa Steel route

1747
01:14:03,903 --> 01:14:04,671
Beagles good

1748
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:06,207
It feels good to cash that check too

1749
01:14:06,463 --> 01:14:06,975
You bet

1750
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:09,535
That's why this stuff works

1751
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:13,631
Hearing it feels good to them to appeals to them at comfort

1752
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:16,447
You got it it sucks too much bad person

1753
01:14:16,703 --> 01:14:19,007
None of what I believe directly

1754
01:14:19,263 --> 01:14:21,823
2 people chanting hang Mike Pence

1755
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:28,223
Or Jews won't replace

1756
01:14:28,479 --> 01:14:31,807
Believe leads directly to that anyway this is all the media

1757
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:33,599
The media and

1758
01:14:34,367 --> 01:14:35,903
Party leaders create the environment

1759
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:37,439
And it made the January 6th

1760
01:14:37,695 --> 01:14:38,463
Violence Alba

1761
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:39,487
But inevitable

1762
01:14:39,999 --> 01:14:41,279
Were there other at

1763
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:43,583
It makes you wonder by Magic

1764
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:45,631
Tears all over the

1765
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:46,911
And this is not exclude

1766
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:48,447
Right-wing riot

1767
01:14:50,495 --> 01:14:51,007
January 6th

1768
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:56,127
Give me the address to cause trouble

1769
01:14:56,383 --> 01:14:56,895
I don't know

1770
01:14:57,151 --> 01:14:58,175
Oh you don't know they just look

1771
01:15:00,991 --> 01:15:01,503
Text you proved it

1772
01:15:01,759 --> 01:15:03,295
You proved that everything

1773
01:15:05,087 --> 01:15:07,647
Yeah I mean if if you replace

1774
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:09,951
It's like all of their subjects with like

1775
01:15:10,207 --> 01:15:11,231
Where is there

1776
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:14,815
Are fairies in the crowd floating around giving us.

1777
01:15:15,071 --> 01:15:16,607
Cost to get us high and send us

1778
01:15:16,863 --> 01:15:21,727
To the capital it's possible if there are some people who looked a little bit shorter than you might think

1779
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:22,751
I think the

1780
01:15:23,007 --> 01:15:23,775
This is week

1781
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:28,639
Internment of Elijah's argument we need someone a little bit more

1782
01:15:28,895 --> 01:15:32,991
Substantial in order to help us with some gravitas

1783
01:15:34,527 --> 01:15:35,039
People that look like me

1784
01:15:37,087 --> 01:15:37,599
Give me the latest

1785
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:38,367
To cause trouble

1786
01:15:38,623 --> 01:15:39,135
I don't know

1787
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:43,743
Someone who might do with security analyst

1788
01:15:43,999 --> 01:15:44,511
Waller

1789
01:15:45,023 --> 01:15:45,535
4 years

1790
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:46,559
Waterworks

1791
01:15:46,815 --> 01:15:47,583
Professional

1792
01:15:48,095 --> 01:15:48,863
I'm a senior analyst

1793
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:49,631
Her strategy

1794
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:50,655
At the Santa Fe

1795
01:15:50,911 --> 01:15:51,423
Security policy

1796
01:15:51,935 --> 01:15:52,703
And my area

1797
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:54,495
Has been

1798
01:15:55,007 --> 01:15:55,775
Political Warfare

1799
01:15:56,287 --> 01:15:57,055
Psychological warfare

1800
01:15:58,079 --> 01:16:03,967
Michael Waller is an analyst for the center for security policy which the splc list doesn't

1801
01:16:04,223 --> 01:16:05,247
Extremist group

1802
01:16:05,503 --> 01:16:11,647
The group was established in 1988 by Frank Gaffney Junior a former Reagan administration member and it was a c

1803
01:16:11,903 --> 01:16:14,207
Super super hawkish group during the Iraq War

1804
01:16:14,975 --> 01:16:17,023
Gaffney himself wasn't inside or an advisor to

1805
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:19,583
The Bush Administration had ties latest 2000

1806
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:21,887
You can find him writing op-ed

1807
01:16:22,143 --> 01:16:23,935
It's about the Patriot Act

1808
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:25,215
The most important

1809
01:16:25,471 --> 01:16:25,983
Piece of

1810
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:28,543
Security legislation adopted since 9/11

1811
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:29,311
Please

1812
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:35,199
In 2006 an article he wrote that was published by his own organization the center for security policy

1813
01:16:37,247 --> 01:16:38,783
The real question that should be asked

1814
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:41,087
The present to Judiciary Committee hearings

1815
01:16:41,343 --> 01:16:44,671
And that will surely be posed when there's another attack is

1816
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:48,255
Did the Bush Administration engage insufficient surveillance

1817
01:16:48,511 --> 01:16:49,279
Not too much

1818
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:51,071
Was it wise Annika

1819
01:16:51,327 --> 01:16:55,167
Concession to civil Libertarians to restrict the use of nsa's Signet tools

1820
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:59,263
First by requiring that one of the parties must be outside the country

1821
01:16:59,519 --> 01:17:02,335
Second but they are tied to Al-Qaeda or an Associated group

1822
01:17:02,847 --> 01:17:04,639
Should we be listening to everyone

1823
01:17:04,895 --> 01:17:05,407
Is the real quick

1824
01:17:05,919 --> 01:17:10,015
Analyst at

1825
01:17:10,271 --> 01:17:11,807
Seems like someone who starts

1826
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:15,135
Civil liberty guys like Tucker wouldn't be into

1827
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:18,463
I'll wait Tucker had their president on the show at

1828
01:17:18,975 --> 01:17:19,487
2019

1829
01:17:19,743 --> 01:17:20,255
Osher

1830
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:21,279
Sure

1831
01:17:21,535 --> 01:17:26,655
Also it should be pointed out that the center for security policies main thing is islamophobia

1832
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:29,215
And in the years since 9/11 they've been

1833
01:17:29,471 --> 01:17:30,495
Think tank that has caused

1834
01:17:30,751 --> 01:17:32,287
Considerable pain to the Muslim

1835
01:17:32,543 --> 01:17:33,567
Community in America

1836
01:17:33,823 --> 01:17:35,103
With their promotion of ideas like

1837
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:36,127
Creeping Sharia

1838
01:17:36,895 --> 01:17:41,759
They also released a reader Series in 2015 about what they call civilization jahad

1839
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:44,831
Which is their way of saying that Muslim immigration to the United

1840
01:17:45,087 --> 01:17:46,111
It states is actually calling

1841
01:17:46,367 --> 01:17:47,647
Asian Andy quote

1842
01:17:47,903 --> 01:17:49,951
Free violent step in taking over the country

1843
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:50,975
Wow

1844
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:52,767
I'm not bringing this up for no

1845
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:57,119
Michael Waller has been published by the center for security policy

1846
01:17:57,375 --> 01:17:58,399
At least 2,000

1847
01:17:58,655 --> 01:17:59,167
5

1848
01:17:59,423 --> 01:18:02,495
He was an active member of this group that was severely pro-war

1849
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:03,519
Pro Patriot Act

1850
01:18:04,031 --> 01:18:06,079
Pro acting like all Muslims are terrorists

1851
01:18:06,591 --> 01:18:09,407
Three things that this documentary is pretending to be opposed to

1852
01:18:10,431 --> 01:18:16,063
In 2003 Waller Road in op-ed that argued that members of Congress who opposed the Iraq War should be tried for

1853
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:16,831
For treason

1854
01:18:17,343 --> 01:18:20,671
Congressman who willfully take actions during wartime

1855
01:18:20,927 --> 01:18:24,255
Damaged morale and undermine the military are Sabbath

1856
01:18:24,511 --> 01:18:26,303
Tours and should be arrested exiled or

1857
01:18:26,559 --> 01:18:27,071
Cocaine

1858
01:18:27,839 --> 01:18:28,607
When is he's kind of a

1859
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:31,935
I would like a military dictatorship please

1860
01:18:32,191 --> 01:18:32,703
Thank you

1861
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:39,103
Waller's a documentary because he was at the Capitol on January 6th then eight days later he published an article titled

1862
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:42,687
I saw provocateurs at the Capitol Riot on January 6th

1863
01:18:43,711 --> 01:18:48,831
It's a dumb and overwritten article with literally no proof of anything so I'll save you the trouble of reading

1864
01:18:49,855 --> 01:18:51,903
The people in camouflage

1865
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:54,719
Sing like this blind soldiers they weren't militia people there actually

1866
01:18:54,975 --> 01:18:56,511
Plants were there to attack the capital

1867
01:18:56,767 --> 01:18:57,535
Why the protests

1868
01:18:57,791 --> 01:18:58,815
Provided cover for them

1869
01:18:59,071 --> 01:19:01,631
Right but they were militia people and we know cuz we have there

1870
01:19:03,167 --> 01:19:03,935
This guy wrote an article

1871
01:19:04,191 --> 01:19:09,567
Oh okay probably a plant

1872
01:19:09,823 --> 01:19:11,871
There's some young people who

1873
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:14,943
Acting weird so he could presume these fake Trump

1874
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:19,551
Supporters we're antifa or something similar

1875
01:19:19,807 --> 01:19:21,855
No proof that they were fake Trump supporters at all

1876
01:19:22,111 --> 01:19:22,879
Just making that s*** up

1877
01:19:23,135 --> 01:19:24,159
Obituary

1878
01:19:24,415 --> 01:19:26,463
Just a little weird or maybe there were high

1879
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:27,999
Trump looks like drugs too

1880
01:19:28,255 --> 01:19:29,535
Everybody likes it

1881
01:19:29,791 --> 01:19:31,327
But the old windows didn't cause any

1882
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:33,375
Any trouble that Waller saw

1883
01:19:33,631 --> 01:19:38,751
It was a camo wearing people who he is more concerned with the ones who are literal Terror

1884
01:19:39,263 --> 01:19:41,823
There was a scuffle and then police threw some tear gas

1885
01:19:43,103 --> 01:19:46,687
For a few seconds I saw what look like police in a tussle with some archers up

1886
01:19:46,943 --> 01:19:49,247
Upfront what appeared to be an organized group in

1887
01:19:49,503 --> 01:19:50,271
Civilian clothes

1888
01:19:50,527 --> 01:19:51,295
Disorganized

1889
01:19:51,551 --> 01:19:54,111
The group are the cell I called the plainclothes militant

1890
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:56,415
They fit right in with the Maga people

1891
01:19:57,183 --> 01:20:03,327
The evidence that he thought they looked organized in that they look like

1892
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:04,351
Maca people which is

1893
01:20:04,863 --> 01:20:06,655
Proof that they're plainclothes militant

1894
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:09,471
It's trying to look like Maga people I don't understand this is

1895
01:20:09,983 --> 01:20:16,128
This is not convincing because you're using real words and you're acting like we're in the real world doesn't

1896
01:20:16,384 --> 01:20:18,176
Mean you're not just describing f******

1897
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:19,456
Hydra from a comic

1898
01:20:19,968 --> 01:20:20,480
Right

1899
01:20:20,992 --> 01:20:21,760
His next piece of evidence

1900
01:20:22,016 --> 01:20:27,904
That there were agents provocateur

1901
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:28,672
Police because

1902
01:20:28,928 --> 01:20:30,976
Is tear gas canisters hit a little girl in the face

1903
01:20:31,232 --> 01:20:32,512
Someone yelled forward

1904
01:20:32,768 --> 01:20:33,536
Do not retreat

1905
01:20:34,304 --> 01:20:35,328
Apparently the use of the word

1906
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:36,352
Was suspicious

1907
01:20:36,608 --> 01:20:38,912
Because it sounded like a quota military operation

1908
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:40,704
Hey buddy if

1909
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:44,288
You think it's weird that Maga folks are throwing around military term

1910
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:50,944
I have some oceanfront property in Arizona to sell you a military term is more likely

1911
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:57,344
Play to be on the left way get the f*** out of here must be of what the FED plant

1912
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:00,672
Definitely when you were selected on the whole thing later Waller.

1913
01:21:00,928 --> 01:21:03,232
Decided that people encouraging folks to

1914
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:05,024
Push forward was actually quote

1915
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:07,072
An organized cell of Agents

1916
01:21:07,328 --> 01:21:07,840
Couture

1917
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:09,632
The Corral people is an unwitting

1918
01:21:09,888 --> 01:21:10,656
Apollo 14

1919
01:21:11,168 --> 01:21:12,448
Behind the plainclothes militant

1920
01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:13,472
Tussling with police

1921
01:21:13,728 --> 01:21:18,080
After thinking about how best to lie about it I've decided this lies the way to go

1922
01:21:18,336 --> 01:21:19,872
That legitimately there's zero evidence

1923
01:21:20,128 --> 01:21:21,664
Since this provided in this article

1924
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:24,480
Box that Waller had which I don't find persuasive

1925
01:21:25,248 --> 01:21:31,392
Piece de resistance of this argument is that for the chaos that already got going in the Capitol was already being so

1926
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:34,208
Waller saw group of approximately three dozen

1927
01:21:34,464 --> 01:21:34,976
Quote YouTube

1928
01:21:37,024 --> 01:21:37,792
Briskly singer

1929
01:21:38,048 --> 01:21:38,816
Single file

1930
01:21:39,328 --> 01:21:40,096
These people were wearing

1931
01:21:40,352 --> 01:21:41,120
Uniform

1932
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:43,168
Like they were like in military uniforms

1933
01:21:43,424 --> 01:21:49,568
And we're taking the capital before disappearing quote under the scaffolding beneath the

1934
01:21:50,848 --> 01:21:51,616
Wow they're good

1935
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:54,432
Provocateurs were wearing plain clothes

1936
01:21:54,688 --> 01:21:59,808
So they could look like Maga folk but I guess these people are identified

1937
01:22:00,064 --> 01:22:03,904
These people are identified as agent provocateurs cuz they're like

1938
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:10,304
These other ones are

1939
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:11,072
Not too

1940
01:22:12,352 --> 01:22:13,376
Let your

1941
01:22:14,144 --> 01:22:17,728
Yeah yeah it's almost like it doesn't matter

1942
01:22:17,984 --> 01:22:19,264
Who or what you are

1943
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:21,312
What matters is that it looked

1944
01:22:21,568 --> 01:22:26,688
Bad for rich people so rich people are going to make money off of

1945
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:27,968
I think the

1946
01:22:28,224 --> 01:22:30,272
This is probably a dramatized

1947
01:22:30,528 --> 01:22:32,320
The count of something Waller saw but

1948
01:22:32,576 --> 01:22:33,344
Even if

1949
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:34,112
Group of people wearing

1950
01:22:34,368 --> 01:22:36,160
Camo and acting like they were in the army

1951
01:22:36,672 --> 01:22:38,720
That doesn't mean that they were agent provocateur

1952
01:22:39,232 --> 01:22:40,256
MPR reported

1953
01:22:40,512 --> 01:22:41,536
Nearly 1 in

1954
01:22:41,792 --> 01:22:43,328
5 people charged over the alleged

1955
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:47,424
Involvement in the attack on the US Capitol appear to have military history

1956
01:22:48,192 --> 01:22:50,752
And that's not even counting for the militia weirdos

1957
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:51,520
Cosplayers

1958
01:22:52,544 --> 01:22:58,688
Nothing in Waller's account actually proves anything but it's good enough to be proved for the right with meteos desperate for flimsy of

1959
01:22:58,944 --> 01:22:59,712
Wouldn't this event was

1960
01:22:59,968 --> 01:23:00,736
Exactly what it is

1961
01:23:01,248 --> 01:23:04,320
We did it we know somebody tell us we didn't

1962
01:23:04,832 --> 01:23:07,648
Jay Michael Waller is somebody who appears to have a fair amount of edge

1963
01:23:07,904 --> 01:23:09,952
Education in the field of political Warfare B

1964
01:23:10,208 --> 01:23:10,720
Even so.

1965
01:23:10,976 --> 01:23:12,000
To take this seriously

1966
01:23:12,256 --> 01:23:13,280
Just because of that

1967
01:23:13,792 --> 01:23:15,840
Who require a serious amount of using

1968
01:23:16,096 --> 01:23:18,144
The appeal to Authority fallacy

1969
01:23:18,656 --> 01:23:20,192
The argument is coming from someone with x

1970
01:23:20,448 --> 01:23:22,240
Forties but it's also a really bad argue

1971
01:23:23,264 --> 01:23:23,776
Still

1972
01:23:24,288 --> 01:23:25,312
Yeah this is

1973
01:23:25,568 --> 01:23:27,616
This is feeling a little bit like Tucker

1974
01:23:28,128 --> 01:23:28,896
Botanicare

1975
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:31,712
A fun bit of trivia about Jan-Michael Waller

1976
01:23:32,224 --> 01:23:37,600
He was also the expert who was interviewed to climate antifa was a gang filled with agent provocateur likely

1977
01:23:37,856 --> 01:23:41,696
We run by a 50 to 70 year old person who's been involved in orchestrating Street violence

1978
01:23:41,952 --> 01:23:42,464
From the Shadows

1979
01:23:42,976 --> 01:23:43,744
For decades

1980
01:23:44,768 --> 01:23:47,072
Lauren Southern documentary Crossfire

1981
01:23:47,584 --> 01:23:49,632
You may recall was directed by

1982
01:23:49,888 --> 01:23:50,656
Scooter Downey

1983
01:23:50,912 --> 01:23:52,960
The co-writer of this Tucker series

1984
01:23:53,984 --> 01:23:54,752
Yeah he keeps

1985
01:23:55,008 --> 01:24:00,896
He's he's been operating it out of secretly out of a home for Extraordinary children don't know if you know it

1986
01:24:01,152 --> 01:24:04,992
This Crossfire was released on December 30th 2020

1987
01:24:05,248 --> 01:24:06,272
Prior to January 6th

1988
01:24:06,528 --> 01:24:08,320
So maybe Waller isn't is unbiased

1989
01:24:08,832 --> 01:24:12,416
As an observer of the events that day as he might want to protect himself as being

1990
01:24:12,928 --> 01:24:13,952
So ridiculous

1991
01:24:14,208 --> 01:24:16,256
I don't hate him as much baby

1992
01:24:16,512 --> 01:24:17,024
Just another

1993
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:17,792
Ship guest

1994
01:24:18,304 --> 01:24:21,632
Nothing is being proven here it is everyone's making me mad

1995
01:24:21,888 --> 01:24:27,264
Hey all you need to do is conjecture that maybe the people at fault warranted fault and then they're like wow that's great

1996
01:24:28,288 --> 01:24:32,384
Gives a little bit of a retelling here of his

1997
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:33,408
His

1998
01:24:33,664 --> 01:24:35,712
Most of the interview is basically just him

1999
01:24:36,224 --> 01:24:38,784
Saying like I know about the stuff I've been involved in things

2000
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:39,552
And then

2001
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:42,624
Retelling what is in that article but it was Article there's more.

2002
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:43,904
Detailed

2003
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:47,744
I was helping this old woman across the street I gave somebody CPR

2004
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,304
To save their life before I even made it

2005
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:51,584
I'm a hero

2006
01:24:52,608 --> 01:24:55,168
So hear you guys talking about a little bit of stuff and then

2007
01:24:55,424 --> 01:24:56,192
Tucker

2008
01:24:56,448 --> 01:24:57,216
That's a brilliant pivot

2009
01:24:58,240 --> 01:25:00,800
You can start seeing different units of agent

2010
01:25:03,104 --> 01:25:03,872
On me

2011
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:05,408
Statue of peace

2012
01:25:06,432 --> 01:25:08,736
And they were assembled in various places on his walkway

2013
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:11,552
Golden members of the crowd trying to cause trouble

2014
01:25:15,392 --> 01:25:16,160
One of those

2015
01:25:16,928 --> 01:25:18,208
Full-time left-wing Act

2016
01:25:18,464 --> 01:25:19,488
Call John cell

2017
01:25:19,744 --> 01:25:21,536
John Sullivan what he does best

2018
01:25:21,792 --> 01:25:22,304
Is agitate

2019
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:23,840
He causes problems and that's what

2020
01:25:24,096 --> 01:25:24,608
He's known for

2021
01:25:24,864 --> 01:25:28,448
John Sullivan is categorically not one of the people that Waller was talk

2022
01:25:28,704 --> 01:25:29,216
About

2023
01:25:29,472 --> 01:25:33,056
He's someone you can definitely argue is not a good influence and people on the left

2024
01:25:33,312 --> 01:25:35,360
Didn't really want to associate with him even prior to the

2025
01:25:36,384 --> 01:25:38,944
It could be fair to say that some of the things that Sullivan was saying had

2026
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:39,712
The potential

2027
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:41,248
To be inciting that day

2028
01:25:41,504 --> 01:25:47,136
But that's also really Far Cry from demonstrating in any way that he was there as a provocateur working

2029
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:49,184
Under the auspices of anybody

2030
01:25:50,976 --> 01:25:53,792
I just don't get how the fact that the night

2031
01:25:54,048 --> 01:25:55,072
Before it happen

2032
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:57,632
Hold your horses

2033
01:25:58,144 --> 01:26:03,776
It is not going to be in the hold your horses do not tell me if you tell me like that

2034
01:26:04,544 --> 01:26:06,080
John Sullivan what he does best

2035
01:26:06,336 --> 01:26:06,848
Is agitate

2036
01:26:07,104 --> 01:26:08,384
He causes problems and that's why

2037
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:09,152
What is known for

2038
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:10,688
On the left and the right

2039
01:26:10,944 --> 01:26:13,248
And he is the person that organizes all of these are bad

2040
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:14,272
Android

2041
01:26:14,784 --> 01:26:15,296
In Utah

2042
01:26:15,552 --> 01:26:16,832
With his Group insurgents USA

2043
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:18,624
Journalist Taylor Hanson

2044
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:22,208
Yeah yeah

2045
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:23,232
Taylor Hanson

2046
01:26:23,488 --> 01:26:24,000
Really

2047
01:26:24,256 --> 01:26:29,376
Really pulling out all the shipment

2048
01:26:29,888 --> 01:26:32,704
Pretty sweet that is unreal.

2049
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:34,752
What kind of where I was almost like I quit

2050
01:26:35,008 --> 01:26:39,872
You're not doing this anymore

2051
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:43,712
Taylor Hanson was on Infowars the day of the storming because

2052
01:26:43,968 --> 01:26:46,784
Inside and was apparently present when Ashley Babbitt was shot

2053
01:26:47,296 --> 01:26:50,624
It's interesting the Tucker discredits him as a journalist but weirdly

2054
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:53,952
Yahoo news article says that he's actually quote

2055
01:26:54,208 --> 01:26:55,232
Activist

2056
01:26:55,488 --> 01:26:56,512
Connected to a group called

2057
01:26:56,768 --> 01:26:57,792
Baby lives matter

2058
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:02,400
That's not actually accurate he's not connected to that group he's the founder of it

2059
01:27:02,656 --> 01:27:03,680
You made a bunch of headlines

2060
01:27:03,936 --> 01:27:04,960
For going outside abortion

2061
01:27:05,216 --> 01:27:07,520
Can clinics and writing baby lives matter on the street

2062
01:27:07,776 --> 01:27:11,360
Yeah that's like most journalists that's how you get your start

2063
01:27:12,384 --> 01:27:16,480
September 2020 he claims that he was beaten up by 4 antifa Black Block members

2064
01:27:16,736 --> 01:27:22,880
I'm not really sure how much of a journalist he is he honestly seems like more of an anti-abortion activist who has a pretty solid

2065
01:27:23,136 --> 01:27:23,904
Backstory

2066
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:26,208
Be mad at the people he uses

2067
01:27:26,464 --> 01:27:27,744
Protesters

2068
01:27:29,024 --> 01:27:34,400
Real though Taylor Hansen might be maybe the worst person to have in this documentary is a talking head for once

2069
01:27:34,656 --> 01:27:35,168
Specific reason

2070
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:36,704
He was on film

2071
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:41,312
In the Capitol at the scene of Ashley Babbitt shooting and no charges have been filed against

2072
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:48,224
He's a walking refutation of the central premise of this documentary which is the people who stormed the capital of being jammed

2073
01:27:49,248 --> 01:27:50,016
You should not have him in

2074
01:27:50,272 --> 01:27:52,064
Their documentary bring way too much attention

2075
01:27:54,368 --> 01:27:57,184
Also as you brought up in as you predicted

2076
01:27:57,440 --> 01:28:01,280
They conveniently leave out the part where the night

2077
01:28:02,816 --> 01:28:05,888
Taylor Hanson joint Owen Shroyer and some other journalists

2078
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:09,728
Been filming themselves burning a black lives matter flag and honestly

2079
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:12,544
I don't know why they didn't mention it in this documentary

2080
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:13,312
It is weird

2081
01:28:13,568 --> 01:28:14,592
It's not like Tucker's audience with

2082
01:28:14,848 --> 01:28:20,992
I think that's a bad thing to do be like of course those guys didn't storm the capital there burning black lives matters Flags

2083
01:28:21,248 --> 01:28:23,552
Here's a clip of them doing that Taylor Hanson

2084
01:28:24,832 --> 01:28:26,112
Fence expert a journalist

2085
01:28:26,368 --> 01:28:28,160
Documentary

2086
01:28:28,928 --> 01:28:30,208
My good friend

2087
01:28:30,464 --> 01:28:31,488
Heckler

2088
01:28:31,744 --> 01:28:33,024
Just going to do a

2089
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:33,792
Little

2090
01:28:34,048 --> 01:28:35,584
Black lives matter in Richmond

2091
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:41,984
Ceremony

2092
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:58,112
Seems like he's a good person to interview on

2093
01:28:58,368 --> 01:28:59,648
I'm critically for this documentary

2094
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:04,512
Totally just a straight down the middle unbiased journalist here definitely not erase

2095
01:29:04,768 --> 01:29:07,072
Anti-abortion activist Deli pretending to be a journal

2096
01:29:07,328 --> 01:29:08,608
How is it not

2097
01:29:08,864 --> 01:29:10,144
So easy for

2098
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:14,240
Like the mainstream media to report on this documentary which they've done

2099
01:29:14,496 --> 01:29:16,544
At nauseam been like

2100
01:29:17,056 --> 01:29:18,592
Covergirl's new Patriot

2101
01:29:18,848 --> 01:29:21,664
First thing and not just like Play Taylor Hanson

2102
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:23,712
Saying something in the documentary

2103
01:29:23,968 --> 01:29:26,784
And then play that f****** clip and be like see and we're done

2104
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:33,184
I don't know I don't I don't I don't know if it is that slam dunk

2105
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:35,488
Yeah I don't think

2106
01:29:35,744 --> 01:29:41,888
The people who this documentary appeals do would be turned off by burning a black lives matter flag but I mean really

2107
01:29:42,144 --> 01:29:44,192
That's unreal

2108
01:29:44,448 --> 01:29:44,960
It's pretty shity

2109
01:29:45,216 --> 01:29:47,520
How do you not burn how do you burn

2110
01:29:47,776 --> 01:29:49,312
Flags and be like where the good guy

2111
01:29:49,824 --> 01:29:53,664
What insane person that I don't know I don't think that the ACT

2112
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:55,456
Itself of burning a flag

2113
01:29:55,712 --> 01:29:56,224
Is bad

2114
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:58,272
I think it depends on the message

2115
01:29:58,528 --> 01:30:00,064
It's trying to be sent by it

2116
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:01,600
Understand I understand but like

2117
01:30:02,624 --> 01:30:05,184
That you're not burning an American

2118
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:05,952
10 Flags

2119
01:30:06,208 --> 01:30:08,256
To protest a f****** War

2120
01:30:11,072 --> 01:30:13,120
You're doing it maliciously and

2121
01:30:13,376 --> 01:30:14,400
Spiteful

2122
01:30:14,656 --> 01:30:15,424
Polly like

2123
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:16,960
And almost like list

2124
01:30:17,216 --> 01:30:21,056
Back to that I haven't I haven't heard that in a while

2125
01:30:21,824 --> 01:30:23,616
It almost feels like an initiation

2126
01:30:23,872 --> 01:30:24,384
Kind of thing

2127
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:27,456
Like boys written all over

2128
01:30:27,712 --> 01:30:32,576
Taylor light it is exactly this is you coming into the name cereals

2129
01:30:32,832 --> 01:30:33,344
Piece of s***

2130
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:36,160
Sunnyway Taylor was

2131
01:30:36,928 --> 01:30:40,000
Like I mentioned

2132
01:30:40,512 --> 01:30:42,816
Interesting the way that this is presented in the documentary

2133
01:30:43,328 --> 01:30:44,352
Journalist Taylor Hanson

2134
01:30:47,168 --> 01:30:48,960
While living in Utah he was attacked

2135
01:30:49,216 --> 01:30:49,984
Buy membership John cell

2136
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:50,752
Group

2137
01:30:52,032 --> 01:30:52,800
And it was

2138
01:30:53,056 --> 01:30:54,336
No ride shortly after

2139
01:30:54,592 --> 01:30:55,360
George Floyd

2140
01:30:55,872 --> 01:30:57,920
I was riding my motorcycle downtown

2141
01:30:58,688 --> 01:30:59,456
For some reason there was you

2142
01:30:59,968 --> 01:31:00,992
She was Car Rally in

2143
01:31:01,504 --> 01:31:04,832
I had no idea what it was not

2144
01:31:05,344 --> 01:31:05,856
Between

2145
01:31:06,112 --> 01:31:07,392
Ended up pulling over

2146
01:31:07,904 --> 01:31:08,416
And that's when I asked

2147
01:31:08,672 --> 01:31:09,952
Actually person counter John Sullivan

2148
01:31:10,208 --> 01:31:12,000
And his group insurgence USA

2149
01:31:12,512 --> 01:31:13,536
Ban antifa attacks

2150
01:31:14,048 --> 01:31:14,816
Ruining my biking

2151
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:18,912
Basically just I mean I actually had a gun pointed to my head at that rally

2152
01:31:19,168 --> 01:31:19,680
Pacifically

2153
01:31:19,936 --> 01:31:20,448
John Sullivan

2154
01:31:21,984 --> 01:31:23,776
Look I don't know if Taylor was attacked

2155
01:31:24,032 --> 01:31:24,800
Multiple times

2156
01:31:25,056 --> 01:31:25,824
But he made

2157
01:31:26,336 --> 01:31:27,360
The headlines

2158
01:31:27,616 --> 01:31:29,664
The Christian Post in September 2020

2159
01:31:30,176 --> 01:31:33,248
What he was beaten and bloodied when he claims he was attacked by auntie

2160
01:31:34,272 --> 01:31:35,808
Problem is that wasn't in Utah

2161
01:31:36,064 --> 01:31:36,832
That was important

2162
01:31:37,088 --> 01:31:39,136
Pictures on how

2163
01:31:39,392 --> 01:31:41,696
From this article in Christian Post of the

2164
01:31:42,464 --> 01:31:44,000
His face after the meeting

2165
01:31:44,512 --> 01:31:47,584
Exactly the pictures that are used in this documentary

2166
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:49,120
Taylor Street Taylor Hanson

2167
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:50,912
Weird

2168
01:31:51,168 --> 01:31:51,936
Weird

2169
01:31:52,448 --> 01:31:53,728
That's I wonder if

2170
01:31:53,984 --> 01:31:56,288
Liars lying about things again

2171
01:31:56,544 --> 01:31:57,824
I mean I wonder

2172
01:31:58,848 --> 01:31:59,616
I just

2173
01:31:59,872 --> 01:32:00,384
I just

2174
01:32:00,896 --> 01:32:02,432
Just f****** just be like

2175
01:32:02,688 --> 01:32:03,200
I was

2176
01:32:03,456 --> 01:32:06,016
Attacked by a group of black Muslims

2177
01:32:06,272 --> 01:32:11,136
And they were all the lgbtq they were all of them they were every Boogeyman

2178
01:32:11,392 --> 01:32:16,000
You've ever heard of they were antifa they were communist they were every

2179
01:32:16,512 --> 01:32:17,536
Just say they were every

2180
01:32:17,792 --> 01:32:20,608
These articles about Taylor's assault

2181
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:27,008
Mysteriously absent from them and from Taylor's account at the time is any mention of John Sullivan

2182
01:32:27,264 --> 01:32:27,776
Actually

2183
01:32:28,032 --> 01:32:28,800
Specifically says that

2184
01:32:29,056 --> 01:32:29,824
They didn't have a gun

2185
01:32:30,336 --> 01:32:31,616
I'm thankful they stop

2186
01:32:31,872 --> 01:32:33,664
The beating when they did and didn't use weapons

2187
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:35,200
To inflict harm or death upon me

2188
01:32:36,224 --> 01:32:37,248
I was going to try and be cute

2189
01:32:37,504 --> 01:32:39,808
Facetious and pretend that Taylor was beating up twice

2190
01:32:40,064 --> 01:32:41,600
But decided to keep the second one

2191
01:32:41,856 --> 01:32:42,880
Secret until now

2192
01:32:43,136 --> 01:32:46,976
Emma Tucker's producers just accidentally used the wrong photos but I'm f******

2193
01:32:47,232 --> 01:32:47,744
Tired

2194
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:53,120
Occam's razor tells me the Tyler beaten up by some dudes in Portland

2195
01:32:53,632 --> 01:32:57,728
He's now trying to rewrite the story to involve some new flashy characters like John Sullivan

2196
01:32:58,240 --> 01:32:59,520
Heightened

2197
01:32:59,776 --> 01:33:00,800
3 globalist

2198
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:04,128
At this point the documentary I realize that were

2199
01:33:04,384 --> 01:33:04,896
Still on

2200
01:33:05,152 --> 01:33:07,200
Episode 1 of this b******* and

2201
01:33:07,456 --> 01:33:07,968
Exhausted

2202
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:11,040
The claims are being made or Sensational in full of s***

2203
01:33:11,296 --> 01:33:14,368
People being treated as experts being interviewed or pretty much all

2204
01:33:14,624 --> 01:33:16,160
Well-known right-wing frauds

2205
01:33:16,416 --> 01:33:17,184
Then propagandists

2206
01:33:17,696 --> 01:33:22,816
It's almost unbearably shity to try and view this as a serious project that someone like Tucker would release

2207
01:33:23,584 --> 01:33:27,424
It's so bad from an information standpoint and the people he's associating with her

2208
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:28,448
Deeply troubling

2209
01:33:28,704 --> 01:33:29,472
I suspected

2210
01:33:29,728 --> 01:33:33,056
He liked his audience he knows that they won't hold his inaccuracies against him and I

2211
01:33:33,312 --> 01:33:33,824
I guess the

2212
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:36,896
Hanging out with Shady weirdos is basically his thing now

2213
01:33:37,408 --> 01:33:37,920
Yeah that's

2214
01:33:38,688 --> 01:33:39,968
That's really sad

2215
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:40,992
Him

2216
01:33:41,248 --> 01:33:42,784
It is for me

2217
01:33:43,296 --> 01:33:47,648
Yeah well I mean it's really sad for you but for him like

2218
01:33:49,696 --> 01:33:52,512
For them for Alexander for Taylor and for those

2219
01:33:53,024 --> 01:33:53,792
To be in this documentary

2220
01:33:54,048 --> 01:33:54,560
Huge cat

2221
01:33:54,816 --> 01:33:58,912
Hugest aspirational for the amazing for them they're in the big leagues

2222
01:33:59,168 --> 01:34:05,312
Tucker's given them shittin AA or time you know if he's presenting them as journalists

2223
01:34:05,568 --> 01:34:06,080
Important

2224
01:34:06,336 --> 01:34:07,360
Activist

2225
01:34:07,872 --> 01:34:08,640
F*** off

2226
01:34:08,896 --> 01:34:09,664
50 Cent

2227
01:34:10,176 --> 01:34:11,968
Sad you're going down in

2228
01:34:12,224 --> 01:34:12,992
Flames if you're working

2229
01:34:13,248 --> 01:34:14,528
With Allie Alexander

2230
01:34:14,784 --> 01:34:16,576
Talking about John Sullivan

2231
01:34:16,832 --> 01:34:18,368
It is you're either like if you're gone

2232
01:34:18,624 --> 01:34:20,416
Associate with Allie Alexander for long

2233
01:34:20,672 --> 01:34:21,696
It's going to bite you in the ass

2234
01:34:21,952 --> 01:34:24,768
You should not do it it's probably going to be a bad idea

2235
01:34:25,024 --> 01:34:30,144
Go the path of Laura Loomer and Jacob Wohl I'm seeing a gate of gates in their future

2236
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:33,472
Conversely

2237
01:34:33,728 --> 01:34:38,848
You're trying to use Ali Alexander in order to like squeeze some juice

2238
01:34:39,104 --> 01:34:41,152
Out of him yeah I feel so sad

2239
01:34:41,408 --> 01:34:45,248
Not much juice left in there

2240
01:34:45,504 --> 01:34:47,296
Nope so there is a FairPoint

2241
01:34:47,552 --> 01:34:50,624
The comes up in that is that the FBI has

2242
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:52,672
Ensnared people in the past

2243
01:34:53,184 --> 01:34:56,256
Oh yeah if you want to go FBI is bad

2244
01:34:56,512 --> 01:34:58,048
You're not going to run out of example

2245
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:00,352
Only has the

2246
01:35:05,984 --> 01:35:06,496
Federal agencies

2247
01:35:09,568 --> 01:35:10,080
Citizens

2248
01:35:17,248 --> 01:35:20,064
Those things are true but that doesn't justify Tucker's in

2249
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:21,088
Intended conclusion

2250
01:35:21,344 --> 01:35:23,904
Mainly that this is what happened on January 6th

2251
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:25,440
The good old Patriots

2252
01:35:25,696 --> 01:35:26,464
Snared by the feds

2253
01:35:26,976 --> 01:35:29,024
Before being true doesn't prove the second

2254
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:31,072
Impart like you just needs to do better this is

2255
01:35:31,328 --> 01:35:32,352
This isn't like a dozen

2256
01:35:32,608 --> 01:35:35,936
AJ saying they've done false

2257
01:35:36,192 --> 01:35:39,264
Flags in the past so why not exactly

2258
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:42,080
Something is possible doesn't prove that it did happen

2259
01:35:43,104 --> 01:35:43,872
This is childish

2260
01:35:44,128 --> 01:35:46,944
During prohibition to the government

2261
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:49,760
Poisoned a lot of booze and killed a lot of people

2262
01:35:50,016 --> 01:35:51,040
Yeah that's true

2263
01:35:51,552 --> 01:35:54,112
Great that doesn't mean that they're poisoning your booze now

2264
01:35:54,368 --> 01:35:55,392
I understand

2265
01:35:55,904 --> 01:35:58,464
So like I said people up and we got it

2266
01:35:58,720 --> 01:35:59,232
An example here

2267
01:35:59,744 --> 01:36:01,280
FBI agents were essentially the

2268
01:36:03,328 --> 01:36:03,840
They made

2269
01:36:04,096 --> 01:36:04,864
The crime crime

2270
01:36:05,376 --> 01:36:06,912
You scarcely need to go back

2271
01:36:07,168 --> 01:36:08,192
Three months

2272
01:36:08,448 --> 01:36:09,984
To the so-called Capital seeds

2273
01:36:12,288 --> 01:36:14,080
Exasperated

2274
01:36:14,336 --> 01:36:14,848
From memory

2275
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:16,896
I'm from the national

2276
01:36:17,408 --> 01:36:18,688
And that is the so-called

2277
01:36:19,456 --> 01:36:19,968
Whitmer

2278
01:36:20,736 --> 01:36:21,248
Kidnapping

2279
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:23,808
You'll explain what you kidnapped.

2280
01:36:24,576 --> 01:36:25,856
Put her on trial for treason

2281
01:36:26,368 --> 01:36:27,648
All because of Michigan

2282
01:36:27,904 --> 01:36:29,696
Covid lockdown federal government

2283
01:36:29,952 --> 01:36:32,000
Awarded an alleged plot

2284
01:36:32,512 --> 01:36:33,280
To kidnap

2285
01:36:33,536 --> 01:36:34,304
The governor

2286
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:35,328
Of Michigan

2287
01:36:36,096 --> 01:36:36,864
In a manner that is

2288
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:37,632
Included

2289
01:36:38,144 --> 01:36:39,168
Shockingly enough

2290
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:41,216
Storming the state capitol

2291
01:36:43,264 --> 01:36:44,544
According to reporting BuzzFeed

2292
01:36:45,056 --> 01:36:45,824
Michigan State play

2293
01:36:50,688 --> 01:36:51,456
Enter the building

2294
01:36:52,736 --> 01:36:53,760
102

2295
01:36:55,552 --> 01:36:58,112
Capitol building

2296
01:37:02,208 --> 01:37:04,256
Interesting parallel

2297
01:37:04,768 --> 01:37:07,584
Definitely could be an interesting parallel that proves it

2298
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:10,656
The same shadowy forces that did the false flag of January 6th

2299
01:37:11,168 --> 01:37:12,960
Also staged the storming of the mission

2300
01:37:13,984 --> 01:37:18,080
Capital or you can say that the right-wing of the pattern of taking over Capitol building

2301
01:37:18,592 --> 01:37:22,176
One of these is an almost embarrassingly simpler explanation

2302
01:37:22,688 --> 01:37:24,480
Right-wing militia folks take

2303
01:37:24,736 --> 01:37:29,088
Can things over like the maligore well that's what they do

2304
01:37:29,344 --> 01:37:32,672
Are you like to occupy especially government

2305
01:37:32,928 --> 01:37:35,744
Control thing while pretending that they have a right

2306
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:36,768
Twitter whatever

2307
01:37:37,024 --> 01:37:39,840
It's a normal thing for them

2308
01:37:40,096 --> 01:37:40,864
Every year

2309
01:37:41,632 --> 01:37:45,216
Also these folks have yet to prove that the feds were responsible for the plot

2310
01:37:45,472 --> 01:37:46,496
The kidnap Governor Whitmer

2311
01:37:47,264 --> 01:37:49,312
The alleged leader of that group Adam Fox

2312
01:37:49,568 --> 01:37:52,896
Definitely isn't an FBI informant which you'd know because most of

2313
01:37:53,152 --> 01:37:58,272
The claims that the FBI's at the group up or just right-wing media sources repeating what his lawyer has said

2314
01:37:58,528 --> 01:37:59,040
In his defense

2315
01:38:00,064 --> 01:38:03,136
There's an ABC news headline but you could choose to report in to differ

2316
01:38:03,392 --> 01:38:04,672
What is depending on what you wanted

2317
01:38:04,928 --> 01:38:05,440
Can back

2318
01:38:05,696 --> 01:38:06,720
You could do with quote

2319
01:38:06,976 --> 01:38:10,304
Michigan Governor kidnap plot dropped out by FBI informant

2320
01:38:10,816 --> 01:38:13,632
I would strongly suggest that the FBI was behind this s***

2321
01:38:13,888 --> 01:38:15,424
That's no part of the headline

2322
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:18,752
You can use the entire headline though and that is quote Michigan governor

2323
01:38:19,008 --> 01:38:21,056
Kidnap plot drugged-up by FBI informants

2324
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:22,848
Accused leader claims

2325
01:38:23,616 --> 01:38:24,384
Because that's the reality

2326
01:38:25,408 --> 01:38:28,224
If you want to you can go and read the criminal complaint

2327
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:32,064
Against the members of this group in Michigan who were charged

2328
01:38:32,576 --> 01:38:35,392
And it's hard to Come Away with the impression that anyone

2329
01:38:35,648 --> 01:38:36,160
What's that up

2330
01:38:36,416 --> 01:38:36,928
Quote

2331
01:38:37,184 --> 01:38:43,328
In early 2020 the FBI became aware through social media that a group of individuals were discussing the violent overthrow of certain

2332
01:38:43,584 --> 01:38:44,608
Government and law enforcement

2333
01:38:44,864 --> 01:38:45,376
Components

2334
01:38:45,888 --> 01:38:47,424
Among those identified Warcraft

2335
01:38:48,704 --> 01:38:49,472
Through electronic

2336
01:38:49,728 --> 01:38:50,240
Communication

2337
01:38:50,496 --> 01:38:53,824
Crofton Fox agreed to unite others in their cause and take violent action

2338
01:38:54,336 --> 01:38:55,616
Multiple state government

2339
01:38:55,872 --> 01:38:57,408
But they believe they're violating the US

2340
01:38:57,920 --> 01:38:58,432
Constitution

2341
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:01,248
They decided to hold a meeting on June 6th

2342
01:39:01,504 --> 01:39:06,880
It was a confidential informant for the FBI was recorded the whole thing

2343
01:39:07,136 --> 01:39:11,744
Quote they discuss different ways of achieving their goal from peaceful Endeavors to Violent actions

2344
01:39:12,256 --> 01:39:16,864
At one point several members talked about state governments they believed were violating the US

2345
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:18,400
Constitution including the government

2346
01:39:18,656 --> 01:39:19,168
Michigan

2347
01:39:19,424 --> 01:39:20,704
Of Governor Gretchen Whitmer

2348
01:39:21,472 --> 01:39:23,008
Several members talked about murder

2349
01:39:23,264 --> 01:39:24,032
Tyrants and

2350
01:39:24,288 --> 01:39:25,824
Taking a sitting governor

2351
01:39:26,592 --> 01:39:28,640
At that point they realize they needed number

2352
01:39:28,896 --> 01:39:30,432
They were pretty small group

2353
01:39:30,688 --> 01:39:33,504
Play reached out to another militia group that was based in Michigan

2354
01:39:34,272 --> 01:39:35,808
Unfortunately unbeknownst to them

2355
01:39:36,064 --> 01:39:39,136
This militia group already had an FBI informant

2356
01:39:39,648 --> 01:39:40,928
Sent back in March.

2357
01:39:41,184 --> 01:39:43,232
Flipped a member of the group when they brought him in for

2358
01:39:43,488 --> 01:39:45,024
Questioning about how this militia group

2359
01:39:45,536 --> 01:39:47,584
Was trying to collect the local law enforcement members

2360
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:48,352
Home address

2361
01:39:49,376 --> 01:39:49,888
So they had

2362
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:50,912
This group

2363
01:39:51,424 --> 01:39:53,728
That they had invited FBI informant into

2364
01:39:53,984 --> 01:39:55,008
Animalistic

2365
01:39:55,264 --> 01:39:59,104
It was already infiltrated for other reason

2366
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:00,128
Here's the worst

2367
01:40:00,384 --> 01:40:05,248
Sing that they do that's a thing that I hate the most about them is that they are self

2368
01:40:05,504 --> 01:40:06,272
F****** stupid

2369
01:40:06,528 --> 01:40:10,112
They use it as a smokescreen there likes nobody could be this stupid

2370
01:40:10,368 --> 01:40:16,512
Believe me to suspect that like pulling off leaderless resistance might be

2371
01:40:16,768 --> 01:40:21,120
More difficult than it seems

2372
01:40:21,376 --> 01:40:25,472
L A really useful you know how they're like a man Alexander the Great

2373
01:40:25,728 --> 01:40:31,104
So great that was another leader this thing deep irony that in order to pull off leaderless resistance

2374
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:32,128
You kind of need

2375
01:40:32,384 --> 01:40:35,456
A lot of grapes

2376
01:40:39,552 --> 01:40:40,576
More leaders now

2377
01:40:41,088 --> 01:40:42,624
Do you have these two groups which

2378
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:43,904
Both have moles

2379
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:46,976
Innominate decided to combine forces and it's just Anime

2380
01:40:47,232 --> 01:40:48,768
Embarrassingly sloppy affair

2381
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:55,424
Reading over this criminal complaint is just a laundry list of pointing out super illegal things these dudes did while they were being Secret

2382
01:40:55,680 --> 01:40:56,192
Early recorded

2383
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:59,520
Just because there were feds in the group doesn't mean that

2384
01:40:59,776 --> 01:41:00,544
The feds entrapta

2385
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:01,312
These people

2386
01:41:01,568 --> 01:41:03,104
It's a sensible question to ask him

2387
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:05,152
By all means it should be a point

2388
01:41:05,664 --> 01:41:07,200
Brought up

2389
01:41:07,456 --> 01:41:08,224
And they're happening

2390
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:09,504
Instances of that in the past

2391
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:11,040
Cast of people getting jammed up

2392
01:41:11,296 --> 01:41:12,064
But the fact that something

2393
01:41:12,576 --> 01:41:13,856
Possibly be true is not the

2394
01:41:14,112 --> 01:41:15,648
Same thing as actually being true

2395
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:19,488
Based on the available information I don't find the argument that the winter

2396
01:41:19,744 --> 01:41:20,768
Whitmer kidnapping

2397
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:24,608
Plot was a FBI setup I don't find that convincing at all

2398
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:29,984
I do however understand how dudes like everyone in this documentary me to believe it's fake

2399
01:41:31,008 --> 01:41:37,152
Yeah it would make them feel really bad not just to be caught but also to be caught being

2400
01:41:37,664 --> 01:41:38,688
Dumb as they really are

2401
01:41:38,944 --> 01:41:42,784
Whenever it comes to light and you read about it you're like

2402
01:41:44,064 --> 01:41:46,112
Like if you want to take if you want to take over mission

2403
01:41:47,136 --> 01:41:49,184
Then you're going to need at least two nuclear weapons

2404
01:41:50,208 --> 01:41:51,232
Before you even start

2405
01:41:51,488 --> 01:41:54,816
Start with the Upper Peninsula need that tune

2406
01:41:55,072 --> 01:41:56,608
Negotiate your

2407
01:41:56,864 --> 01:41:59,680
There's no way that the government is going to allow you to do that unless you have it

2408
01:41:59,936 --> 01:42:01,216
At least 21 of which you have

2409
01:42:01,472 --> 01:42:01,984
Does that off

2410
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:03,520
In order to prove that you will

2411
01:42:04,544 --> 01:42:10,688
I think this is a very restrained option I think I'm doing this right I'm just saying if you want to if you want to overthrow the government is going to take a

2412
01:42:10,944 --> 01:42:11,712
A lot more ground

2413
01:42:12,224 --> 01:42:14,528
So I'll leave you to that planning

2414
01:42:14,784 --> 01:42:15,552
Move on

2415
01:42:15,808 --> 01:42:16,320
This next clip

2416
01:42:16,576 --> 01:42:17,088
It 1

2417
01:42:17,344 --> 01:42:18,624
For like

2418
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:23,744
Tucker to have Gaston like this Darren Beattie character he's lying about the FBI

2419
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:25,536
Whitmer kidnapping

2420
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:30,400
Got a weird when Tucker as the voice-over person decides to lie to

2421
01:42:30,912 --> 01:42:31,936
Well it gets even better

2422
01:42:32,448 --> 01:42:32,960
12

2423
01:42:33,216 --> 01:42:35,264
18 conspirators

2424
01:42:36,288 --> 01:42:36,800
Undercover

2425
01:42:37,056 --> 01:42:37,568
FBI

2426
01:42:38,592 --> 01:42:39,360
In other words

2427
01:42:39,616 --> 01:42:40,128
2/3

2428
01:42:40,384 --> 01:42:42,944
To the people plotting to kidnap the governor of Michigan

2429
01:42:43,456 --> 01:42:44,480
We're working directly for

2430
01:42:44,736 --> 01:42:45,248
For the feds

2431
01:42:46,528 --> 01:42:47,296
That's quite a percentage

2432
01:42:47,808 --> 01:42:48,576
This isn't true

2433
01:42:49,344 --> 01:42:52,160
It's basically just a misrepresentation of the headline from Buzz

2434
01:42:52,928 --> 01:42:56,000
The FBI allegedly used at least 12 and 4 min

2435
01:42:56,256 --> 01:42:57,024
Any Michigan

2436
01:42:58,304 --> 01:43:03,424
I didn't initially understand exactly where Tucker was getting the 18 number from because

2437
01:43:03,680 --> 01:43:06,496
On October 8th the FBI announce they file charges

2438
01:43:06,752 --> 01:43:09,056
Michigan militia members

2439
01:43:09,312 --> 01:43:11,360
With at least six of them being charged and connect

2440
01:43:11,872 --> 01:43:12,640
Directly to the

2441
01:43:14,432 --> 01:43:15,200
Governor Whitmer

2442
01:43:15,712 --> 01:43:21,600
If you read the court filing you'll see that there were two confidential informants as well as two undercover employees mixed in with

2443
01:43:21,856 --> 01:43:22,624
Folks were plotting to

2444
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:23,648
Kidnap and

2445
01:43:23,904 --> 01:43:25,184
Ultimately kill Whitmer

2446
01:43:25,696 --> 01:43:26,208
Because they did

2447
01:43:26,464 --> 01:43:27,744
Horrible job in operation

2448
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:28,512
Insecurities

2449
01:43:28,768 --> 01:43:29,280
They weren't

2450
01:43:29,536 --> 01:43:33,120
Convince to do this by the cops in their ranks they were just so dumb that they had cops

2451
01:43:33,376 --> 01:43:34,400
Recording all of their meeting

2452
01:43:35,424 --> 01:43:36,192
If I had to guess

2453
01:43:36,704 --> 01:43:37,984
Believe this is

2454
01:43:38,240 --> 01:43:41,824
This narrative about 18 people

2455
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:44,128
Going to 12 out of the 18 people

2456
01:43:44,640 --> 01:43:45,664
I already informed

2457
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:46,432
Is it

2458
01:43:46,944 --> 01:43:47,968
Songs from a headline

2459
01:43:48,224 --> 01:43:50,016
Of the story in the Gateway pundit

2460
01:43:50,528 --> 01:43:51,808
It was a setup

2461
01:43:52,064 --> 01:43:56,160
SBI used at least 12 informants in witmer kidnapping case with only

2462
01:43:56,416 --> 01:43:56,928
3625

2463
01:43:57,696 --> 01:43:58,720
Add that together

2464
01:43:58,976 --> 01:43:59,488
18

2465
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:03,328
If you only go based on that headline you don't look any further into the story

2466
01:44:04,096 --> 01:44:07,680
Add those numbers together and get 18 people 12 of humor feds

2467
01:44:08,192 --> 01:44:08,960
However that is not

2468
01:44:09,728 --> 01:44:11,008
And it's either an indication

2469
01:44:11,264 --> 01:44:15,872
Nubian too lazy to report this accurately desire to willfully 278.

2470
01:44:16,128 --> 01:44:16,640
Information

2471
01:44:17,664 --> 01:44:23,040
Any responsible reporter would know that there were quote eight other men charged under Michigan's anti-terrorism

2472
01:44:23,296 --> 01:44:24,320
Statutes for providing

2473
01:44:24,576 --> 01:44:25,088
Google support

2474
01:44:25,344 --> 01:44:25,856
The plotters

2475
01:44:26,624 --> 01:44:27,136
Tirolesa

2476
01:44:27,648 --> 01:44:30,464
People who were charged with the actual conspiracy

2477
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:31,488
Not plot

2478
01:44:31,744 --> 01:44:33,280
Charged with providing support

2479
01:44:33,792 --> 01:44:35,072
Some of these people aided in like

2480
01:44:35,328 --> 01:44:39,424
Speakingout wittmershaus and wanted hosted their meetings at his home

2481
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:40,448
So that kind of stuff

2482
01:44:40,704 --> 01:44:42,496
This is what these other eight folks did

2483
01:44:44,544 --> 01:44:45,056
Okay

2484
01:44:45,312 --> 01:44:45,824
Okay

2485
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:46,848
Imagine your

2486
01:44:47,104 --> 01:44:47,616
Staking out

2487
01:44:47,872 --> 01:44:49,408
Governor whitmer's house like

2488
01:44:49,664 --> 01:44:50,688
Who's going to end well for me

2489
01:44:51,712 --> 01:44:55,040
I can trust these weirdos is going to go great

2490
01:44:55,296 --> 01:45:01,184
You'll notice that I was actually a total of 14 people instead of 13 I said we're charged on October 8th

2491
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:02,720
That's because one other guy got

2492
01:45:03,744 --> 01:45:04,768
Didn't charge a little bit later

2493
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:05,792
Anyone

2494
01:45:06,048 --> 01:45:09,632
Eating a narrative the 12 out of the 18 people involved in the Michigan kidnapping

2495
01:45:09,888 --> 01:45:10,912
Simplot where feds

2496
01:45:11,424 --> 01:45:12,192
Is this regurgitating

2497
01:45:12,448 --> 01:45:13,472
Far-right media talk

2498
01:45:14,752 --> 01:45:16,544
It's unfortunate when just an average person on the

2499
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:18,080
What street does this but it's horrific

2500
01:45:18,592 --> 01:45:20,640
You talk or doing it in this dumb documentary

2501
01:45:21,152 --> 01:45:25,504
That implies that the standard he has for information is so low that he could report

2502
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:28,064
Is based on a misleading Gateway public headline

2503
01:45:28,576 --> 01:45:29,088
Or that

2504
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:32,672
He knows it's misinformation and included in the documentary anyway

2505
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:38,048
Having grown up in a world where Tucker Carlson has been a public figure the whole time I'm going to bet it

2506
01:45:38,304 --> 01:45:38,816
It's the second one

2507
01:45:39,584 --> 01:45:40,096
I don't think

2508
01:45:40,608 --> 01:45:41,632
I don't think he's that dumb

2509
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:43,424
And also that

2510
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:44,960
That's probably why it's on for

2511
01:45:45,984 --> 01:45:48,288
Because there's anybody really going to demand

2512
01:45:49,568 --> 01:45:50,080
I will

2513
01:45:53,152 --> 01:45:59,296
Think anyone's going to do it

2514
01:45:59,552 --> 01:46:00,320
Mane Attraction as well

2515
01:46:08,256 --> 01:46:11,072
So we have we have another

2516
01:46:11,328 --> 01:46:12,096
Piece of evidence

2517
01:46:12,352 --> 01:46:13,120
What's the Darren Beattie is

2518
01:46:13,376 --> 01:46:13,888
Going to prison

2519
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:15,680
Year of

2520
01:46:15,936 --> 01:46:16,448
Love Y8

2521
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:17,472
Clearly

2522
01:46:22,592 --> 01:46:23,104
Does that mean that

2523
01:46:23,360 --> 01:46:24,896
Deep state did it might as well be

2524
01:46:25,408 --> 01:46:26,176
It's that flimsy

2525
01:46:26,944 --> 01:46:27,712
It gets even better

2526
01:46:28,224 --> 01:46:30,528
Many of the individuals involved in this

2527
01:46:31,296 --> 01:46:36,928
Have been associated with a very same militia group that the government is attempted to associate

2528
01:46:37,184 --> 01:46:37,952
With 16

2529
01:46:38,464 --> 01:46:39,232
I don't think that's

2530
01:46:39,488 --> 01:46:41,792
Proof of conspiracy the same like as much as

2531
01:46:42,304 --> 01:46:44,352
Thanks it is maybe they just all

2532
01:46:45,888 --> 01:46:46,400
Oh

2533
01:46:46,912 --> 01:46:50,240
The reference to the fact that there were members of the three percenters who are

2534
01:46:50,496 --> 01:46:52,544
At the Capitol Riot on January 6th

2535
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:54,336
And that some members of the group

2536
01:46:54,592 --> 01:46:57,664
Involved in the witmer kidnapping flower also associated

2537
01:46:57,920 --> 01:46:58,432
With three

2538
01:46:58,688 --> 01:46:59,200
Supercenter

2539
01:46:59,712 --> 01:47:00,736
This doesn't prove or even see

2540
01:47:00,992 --> 01:47:03,808
Suggest that the events are related

2541
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:09,952
Really just a reflection of how three percenters are pretty f***** up folks of a tendency towards doing f*****-up and violent thing

2542
01:47:10,464 --> 01:47:11,744
Presumably in the name

2543
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:12,512
Of Defending

2544
01:47:13,024 --> 01:47:13,792
Yeah

2545
01:47:14,048 --> 01:47:17,376
I don't really understand how this details being presented to some kind of

2546
01:47:17,632 --> 01:47:18,912
Support for the documentaries thesis

2547
01:47:19,168 --> 01:47:19,680
Good kind of work

2548
01:47:19,936 --> 01:47:20,448
Better

2549
01:47:20,704 --> 01:47:26,080
The opposite way I mean that's a little bit like being like a hossino did you see this

2550
01:47:26,592 --> 01:47:27,616
Three Oaks

2551
01:47:27,872 --> 01:47:30,176
Keepers were also members of the clan

2552
01:47:30,432 --> 01:47:36,576
That's obviously a conspiracy by the FBI I couldn't have brought the 7-Eleven because I have 50

2553
01:47:36,832 --> 01:47:37,600
Slurpees

2554
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:47,328
See if so facto you fool

2555
01:47:47,584 --> 01:47:49,376
There's one more piece of evidence

2556
01:47:49,632 --> 01:47:50,912
Being presented

2557
01:47:51,168 --> 01:47:52,448
Please come like in a

2558
01:47:52,704 --> 01:47:54,496
Dentistry

2559
01:47:54,752 --> 01:47:56,288
Dumb dumb

2560
01:47:57,056 --> 01:47:57,824
And if that isn't

2561
01:47:58,848 --> 01:47:59,872
I'll give you the cherry on

2562
01:48:00,384 --> 01:48:00,896
Hello

2563
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:02,432
I'm Steven

2564
01:48:02,944 --> 01:48:03,968
The head of the

2565
01:48:04,224 --> 01:48:08,064
Detroit field office of the FBI who presumably oversaw

2566
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:10,624
All of those aging presumably

2567
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:12,672
Actively involved in inciting

2568
01:48:12,928 --> 01:48:13,696
The Michigan

2569
01:48:13,952 --> 01:48:14,464
Kidnapping

2570
01:48:15,488 --> 01:48:16,512
Subsequent to that

2571
01:48:17,536 --> 01:48:18,560
He was quietly and

2572
01:48:18,816 --> 01:48:20,096
Suspiciously promoted

2573
01:48:20,352 --> 01:48:22,912
Position within the DC field

2574
01:48:24,192 --> 01:48:24,960
Where he now

2575
01:48:25,728 --> 01:48:27,008
Oversees the investor

2576
01:48:30,592 --> 01:48:34,688
So this is the reference to Stephen jontrona II

2577
01:48:34,944 --> 01:48:36,480
Okay

2578
01:48:36,736 --> 01:48:38,528
There's a lot to unpack in their 30s

2579
01:48:38,784 --> 01:48:39,296
Second clip

2580
01:48:39,808 --> 01:48:41,600
The first thing is that Darren Beattie who's talking

2581
01:48:41,856 --> 01:48:43,648
I'm here has absolutely not proven it

2582
01:48:43,904 --> 01:48:46,720
Anyway that the FBI agents in Michigan were quote

2583
01:48:46,976 --> 01:48:48,256
Involved in inciting the plot

2584
01:48:48,768 --> 01:48:52,352
He's asserted it and Tucker has provided inaccurate information that he thinks

2585
01:48:53,888 --> 01:48:56,192
But nothing so far has established this grievance

2586
01:48:56,448 --> 01:48:56,960
Come close

2587
01:48:57,472 --> 01:48:58,240
If he's wrong

2588
01:48:58,496 --> 01:48:59,520
Fbt is wrong

2589
01:48:59,776 --> 01:49:03,104
And the FBI agents in Michigan in that case didn't do anything wrong

2590
01:49:03,616 --> 01:49:06,432
But who cares if a guy goes from one FBI office to another

2591
01:49:07,200 --> 01:49:09,504
Meaning of haughty I watch

2592
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:10,528
Amman

2593
01:49:10,784 --> 01:49:12,576
Climbing the corporate ladder

2594
01:49:13,088 --> 01:49:15,392
Second BT's claiming that don't wanna was

2595
01:49:16,672 --> 01:49:19,232
Liam suspiciously promoted to a higher position

2596
01:49:19,488 --> 01:49:24,096
After the witmer kidnapping case so many loud

2597
01:49:24,352 --> 01:49:25,376
Loud enough

2598
01:49:25,632 --> 01:49:29,472
Fishman going to the DC FBI

2599
01:49:30,752 --> 01:49:36,896
And also the FBI's literally put out a press release about it being moved to the DC field office on October 13th

2600
01:49:37,152 --> 01:49:37,664
2020

2601
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:38,688
It doesn't seem very

2602
01:49:38,944 --> 01:49:40,736
Quiet they did it to

2603
01:49:40,992 --> 01:49:42,016
Suspicious lady

2604
01:49:42,272 --> 01:49:44,576
Informed the Press

2605
01:49:45,344 --> 01:49:50,720
What's going on here at a bunch of throwing those words into blank creates suspicion

2606
01:49:50,976 --> 01:49:55,328
If you read the press release about his promotion you'll learn that this was only sort of a

2607
01:49:55,584 --> 01:49:56,096
Promotion

2608
01:49:56,352 --> 01:50:00,448
Previously the special agent in charge at the Detroit field office

2609
01:50:00,704 --> 01:50:01,984
Went to DC

2610
01:50:02,240 --> 01:50:05,056
He was assistant director in charge of the Washington field office

2611
01:50:05,824 --> 01:50:09,920
Both of these are supervisor positions at the top of the office hierarchy

2612
01:50:10,176 --> 01:50:15,808
It's just that the LA New York City and DC offices they have assistant directors in charge as

2613
01:50:16,064 --> 01:50:17,088
Boss as opposed to

2614
01:50:17,344 --> 01:50:20,160
The other 53 FBI field offices in the United States

2615
01:50:20,416 --> 01:50:21,696
Better run by special agent

2616
01:50:21,952 --> 01:50:23,488
Symptom charts just cuz they're bigger office

2617
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:25,536
I get it this is a bit of a promotion

2618
01:50:25,792 --> 01:50:31,424
Since you'll be overseeing a larger FBI office but his bio makes me think that he probably also wanted to go to

2619
01:50:31,680 --> 01:50:33,472
DC because that's where he spent a lot of his

2620
01:50:33,728 --> 01:50:34,240
His career

2621
01:50:34,752 --> 01:50:39,104
From 1998 to 2004 he was at that same DC field office

2622
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:39,872
Swear Aponte

2623
01:50:40,128 --> 01:50:42,176
He spent four years teaching at the FBI Academy

2624
01:50:42,944 --> 01:50:44,224
After that he transferred back

2625
01:50:44,480 --> 01:50:44,992
To the DC off

2626
01:50:45,760 --> 01:50:50,624
He was there for another six years before going to St Louis and then he ended up in Detroit in 29

2627
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:51,392
19

2628
01:50:51,648 --> 01:50:55,488
He seems to have a pretty accomplished career but also one with roots in DC and I

2629
01:50:55,744 --> 01:50:59,072
I don't think it seems suspicious at all that he would be offered that position

2630
01:50:59,584 --> 01:51:00,608
An accepted

2631
01:51:01,888 --> 01:51:02,912
Lateral move

2632
01:51:04,448 --> 01:51:05,216
On CNN

2633
01:51:05,472 --> 01:51:06,496
I can come up with a

2634
01:51:06,752 --> 01:51:07,264
Better cancel

2635
01:51:07,520 --> 01:51:08,288
Pleurisy

2636
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:09,312
So this

2637
01:51:09,824 --> 01:51:10,336
Raikou

2638
01:51:10,592 --> 01:51:12,896
He was named special agent-in-charge over the

2639
01:51:13,152 --> 01:51:15,200
Detroit

2640
01:51:15,712 --> 01:51:18,272
That position only became available because

2641
01:51:18,528 --> 01:51:21,344
The person previously in that position Timothy Slater

2642
01:51:21,600 --> 01:51:23,136
Have been transferred to lead the washing

2643
01:51:23,392 --> 01:51:24,672
DC field office

2644
01:51:24,928 --> 01:51:25,696
The same position

2645
01:51:25,952 --> 01:51:28,768
What happened was

2646
01:51:29,024 --> 01:51:31,328
Right they transferred him out in a

2647
01:51:31,584 --> 01:51:37,728
Vance of this guy taking over the Michigan office to lay the groundwork for the eventual overthrow

2648
01:51:37,984 --> 01:51:43,616
It all makes sense now, together

2649
01:51:44,128 --> 01:51:47,968
I didn't even think they were going to fit and then all the sudden whenever I put

2650
01:51:48,224 --> 01:51:49,760
Push them into the spot where they were supposed to

2651
01:51:50,016 --> 01:51:50,784
Stupid

2652
01:51:51,296 --> 01:51:57,440
Just in case that like there was something we're like the Detroit field office was a like a farm system should be

2653
01:51:57,696 --> 01:52:03,840
I went and check the other people that's not a pattern

2654
01:52:04,096 --> 01:52:09,728
Dad I thought like maybe be really interesting.

2655
01:52:11,264 --> 01:52:12,032
Things that this is a smoker

2656
01:52:12,288 --> 01:52:13,824
Can Gunn kind of Revelation but it's

2657
01:52:14,080 --> 01:52:15,360
Really more of a who cares

2658
01:52:15,872 --> 01:52:21,760
If you don't believe all the b******* about the Whitmer kidnapping plot being an FBI setup then all that happened here is that a welder

2659
01:52:22,016 --> 01:52:23,552
Respected FBI agent-in-charge of

2660
01:52:23,808 --> 01:52:24,320
Field office

2661
01:52:24,576 --> 01:52:27,136
Was put in charge of the larger FBI field office

2662
01:52:27,648 --> 01:52:29,952
Even if you do believe that the witmer kidnapping

2663
01:52:30,208 --> 01:52:33,280
FBI setup that still doesn't make this

2664
01:52:33,536 --> 01:52:36,352
That good of a piece of evidence the January 6th was a setup

2665
01:52:37,120 --> 01:52:40,192
Books like Darren or Tucker Alex for that matter

2666
01:52:40,448 --> 01:52:43,520
Understand what it means to prove or demonstrate something

2667
01:52:43,776 --> 01:52:46,336
Thing and I suspect a large part of that is because their audience

2668
01:52:46,848 --> 01:52:48,640
They don't incentivize them doing so

2669
01:52:49,152 --> 01:52:51,456
The attention economy that they profit off of is

2670
01:52:51,712 --> 01:52:53,248
What's more interested in shocking twist

2671
01:52:53,504 --> 01:52:55,040
Sensor surprise reveal

2672
01:52:55,552 --> 01:52:57,856
Blow people's minds by pointing out

2673
01:52:58,112 --> 01:53:00,672
But the head of the DC office used to be the head of the Detroit office

2674
01:53:00,928 --> 01:53:05,792
And then take credit for having proven that the large event in both places were secret FBI plot

2675
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:09,120
The actual content and arguments being made or mean

2676
01:53:09,632 --> 01:53:11,936
But they leave viewers with the feeling of having

2677
01:53:12,192 --> 01:53:13,728
The something was revealed

2678
01:53:13,984 --> 01:53:15,520
Bro I'm at revelation

2679
01:53:15,776 --> 01:53:16,800
Is being sort of

2680
01:53:17,056 --> 01:53:17,824
Sidetracked

2681
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:18,592
Can perverted

2682
01:53:19,104 --> 01:53:20,128
Into like convincing

2683
01:53:20,384 --> 01:53:20,896
The audience

2684
01:53:21,152 --> 01:53:21,664
What's that

2685
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:22,432
Hey

2686
01:53:22,688 --> 01:53:24,480
They proved it this is

2687
01:53:24,736 --> 01:53:26,016
Can you believe it dude

2688
01:53:26,272 --> 01:53:28,576
You have no idea I'm going to throw this one out at

2689
01:53:28,832 --> 01:53:29,344
Okay

2690
01:53:29,600 --> 01:53:30,880
So there was this

2691
01:53:31,136 --> 01:53:33,184
Like famous neocon guy

2692
01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:35,488
All right and he supported all of these

2693
01:53:35,744 --> 01:53:40,096
Middle-of-the-road Rhino policies for the longest time

2694
01:53:40,608 --> 01:53:41,120
But then

2695
01:53:41,376 --> 01:53:42,912
Okay and this is going to blow your mind

2696
01:53:43,168 --> 01:53:43,680
Then

2697
01:53:43,936 --> 01:53:49,312
Then he saw an opportunity to make more money doing something else

2698
01:53:49,824 --> 01:53:50,592
Right

2699
01:53:50,848 --> 01:53:52,896
He took a job to do that other thing

2700
01:53:53,152 --> 01:53:57,504
Even though he didn't really believe any of the b******* because he still that neocon

2701
01:53:57,760 --> 01:54:00,064
From way back when Dan do you get it

2702
01:54:00,576 --> 01:54:03,136
Controlled opposition from the neocon

2703
01:54:03,392 --> 01:54:09,536
To run the new populist movement man next thing you know you're going to tell me who used to wear a bow tie

2704
01:54:09,792 --> 01:54:11,328
To tell you that he's

2705
01:54:11,584 --> 01:54:12,096
2

2706
01:54:12,608 --> 01:54:13,888
I want

2707
01:54:14,144 --> 01:54:20,288
How to make clear that you're not suggesting that that was that was like a clearly

2708
01:54:20,544 --> 01:54:26,688
Keisha's total voice but if not I just want to make sure that no one thinks that you're suggesting the Tucker Carlson is legit

2709
01:54:26,944 --> 01:54:32,320
Neocon as a plant control

2710
01:54:32,576 --> 01:54:36,416
Saying that they're choosing a specific at the eye

2711
01:54:36,672 --> 01:54:39,232
To go after not the head of the DC office

2712
01:54:39,488 --> 01:54:41,536
At the time of the Michigan overthrow

2713
01:54:42,048 --> 01:54:43,840
If that's the guy who would really be running

2714
01:54:45,632 --> 01:54:46,144
The other guy

2715
01:54:46,656 --> 01:54:47,936
Well they're trying to take this

2716
01:54:48,192 --> 01:54:49,216
FBI agent lion

2717
01:54:49,728 --> 01:54:51,520
So it won't last boyfriend

2718
01:54:51,776 --> 01:54:52,288
Sort of

2719
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:58,432
Putnam's humpback of course they did a great job.

2720
01:55:00,736 --> 01:55:02,016
Chaos of January 6th

2721
01:55:07,392 --> 01:55:07,904
Incitement

2722
01:55:10,464 --> 01:55:10,976
Entrapment

2723
01:55:12,768 --> 01:55:13,536
No decent

2724
01:55:14,304 --> 01:55:15,072
Believe that

2725
01:55:16,096 --> 01:55:16,864
Recently there's evidence

2726
01:55:18,144 --> 01:55:19,168
It makes you wonder

2727
01:55:21,728 --> 01:55:24,032
Second war on terror

2728
01:55:24,288 --> 01:55:24,800
Citizen

2729
01:55:25,568 --> 01:55:26,336
What else are they

2730
01:55:35,552 --> 01:55:38,624
I just was like I'm not I'm not doing the other one

2731
01:55:38,880 --> 01:55:41,184
I don't care if they're just as stupid

2732
01:55:42,976 --> 01:55:43,744
The blade

2733
01:55:44,512 --> 01:55:45,024
Bulbs

2734
01:55:45,280 --> 01:55:45,792
Face-f***

2735
01:55:46,048 --> 01:55:47,072
IQ of someone

2736
01:55:47,328 --> 01:55:49,120
Who knows what they're saying is

2737
01:55:49,376 --> 01:55:55,520
Isn't true saying no decent person would want to believe this no decent person

2738
01:55:55,776 --> 01:55:57,312
I want to believe this so you

2739
01:55:57,568 --> 01:55:58,336
You idiot

2740
01:55:58,592 --> 01:55:59,104
It's you f***

2741
01:55:59,360 --> 01:55:59,872
Kingroot

2742
01:56:00,128 --> 01:56:01,920
Watching this dumb documentary

2743
01:56:02,176 --> 01:56:04,992
Very fact that you want this s*** to be true

2744
01:56:05,248 --> 01:56:07,808
Tucker Carlson is letting you know you're a f******

2745
01:56:08,064 --> 01:56:08,832
Pilot s***

2746
01:56:09,856 --> 01:56:11,648
I'm generous reading of his comment

2747
01:56:12,416 --> 01:56:13,184
So what do you think

2748
01:56:14,464 --> 01:56:16,768
I mean pat-on-the-back all around

2749
01:56:18,048 --> 01:56:19,328
Glass of champagne

2750
01:56:19,584 --> 01:56:20,864
Totally I break out the bubbly

2751
01:56:23,424 --> 01:56:26,496
When you nail it on the first take I don't need two more episodes

2752
01:56:27,008 --> 01:56:29,312
Yeah I'm just saying when you got all the information

2753
01:56:29,568 --> 01:56:30,848
Out in one app

2754
01:56:31,104 --> 01:56:31,616
Episode

2755
01:56:31,872 --> 01:56:32,896
Ironclad

2756
01:56:33,152 --> 01:56:34,432
Airtight

2757
01:56:35,456 --> 01:56:36,736
Just let it stand on its own

2758
01:56:37,760 --> 01:56:39,296
How you think

2759
01:56:39,552 --> 01:56:40,832
Like when you have

2760
01:56:41,088 --> 01:56:42,368
A documentary

2761
01:56:42,624 --> 01:56:44,416
The experts that you have

2762
01:56:44,672 --> 01:56:46,208
Include Alexander

2763
01:56:46,464 --> 01:56:47,488
Taylor Hanson

2764
01:56:47,744 --> 01:56:49,792
And Darren Beattie

2765
01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:52,352
About

2766
01:56:53,120 --> 01:56:54,400
Go fuc yourself you know

2767
01:56:54,656 --> 01:56:55,168
I mean

2768
01:56:55,424 --> 01:56:55,936
I think

2769
01:56:56,448 --> 01:56:57,984
Part of my problem with this

2770
01:56:58,496 --> 01:56:59,776
Is also

2771
01:57:00,032 --> 01:57:02,592
They're wasting a lot of money on this production

2772
01:57:03,360 --> 01:57:06,432
Because we've seems yeah we've seen better ship

2773
01:57:06,688 --> 01:57:07,200
Cheaper

2774
01:57:07,456 --> 01:57:08,224
Maybe you know

2775
01:57:08,736 --> 01:57:09,760
But this isn't good

2776
01:57:11,808 --> 01:57:13,600
Some decent production value problem

2777
01:57:13,856 --> 01:57:15,648
Yeah yeah but you know it's not good

2778
01:57:15,904 --> 01:57:16,672
It doesn't have to be good

2779
01:57:16,928 --> 01:57:18,464
No I know Telugu

2780
01:57:18,720 --> 01:57:21,024
Subscription I know but I'm just saying that you could cut some

2781
01:57:21,280 --> 01:57:22,304
Corners in a lot of places

2782
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:23,840
Susan save money on the production

2783
01:57:24,096 --> 01:57:30,240
You probably could but you don't cry number one problem prizes

2784
01:57:33,568 --> 01:57:36,384
Watching the documentary I found to be a pretty chilling

2785
01:57:36,640 --> 01:57:39,200
Experience emotional archives

2786
01:57:39,456 --> 01:57:40,224
Stefan molyneux

2787
01:57:40,480 --> 01:57:41,760
Poland documentary which

2788
01:57:42,016 --> 01:57:42,528
At least had the

2789
01:57:42,784 --> 01:57:45,856
Cathartic ending when he realized he was a white nationalist

2790
01:57:46,112 --> 01:57:47,904
It like the entertaining bombast

2791
01:57:48,160 --> 01:57:49,696
Fake crying and sometimes interests

2792
01:57:50,720 --> 01:57:51,744
But something Alex makes

2793
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:52,768
Usually has

2794
01:57:53,024 --> 01:57:54,560
Yeah it really is

2795
01:57:54,816 --> 01:57:57,376
The package

2796
01:57:57,632 --> 01:57:59,936
Bigotry just being delivered in a more presentable pack

2797
01:58:01,216 --> 01:58:01,728
One of the things

2798
01:58:01,984 --> 01:58:03,264
Things that really troubled me watch

2799
01:58:03,520 --> 01:58:05,568
I honestly don't know what anyone

2800
01:58:05,824 --> 01:58:06,336
Can do about it

2801
01:58:07,104 --> 01:58:13,248
This documentary is full of obvious and transparent lies but Tucker's cultivated an audience that doesn't really care and they think

2802
01:58:13,504 --> 01:58:15,040
George Soros controls all fact

2803
01:58:16,320 --> 01:58:20,416
The impulse you would seem to have would be to spread the message of his thing is bull

2804
01:58:20,928 --> 01:58:21,440
Loudly

2805
01:58:21,696 --> 01:58:23,232
And as publicly as you can

2806
01:58:23,488 --> 01:58:24,768
Come and watch the thing I

2807
01:58:25,024 --> 01:58:26,048
Think that's what the goal is

2808
01:58:28,352 --> 01:58:31,680
Well if you get people to scream about fox

2809
01:58:31,936 --> 01:58:32,448
Nation

2810
01:58:32,704 --> 01:58:36,288
Foxnation.com how dare he do that on Fox Nation

2811
01:58:36,544 --> 01:58:37,056
Dot-com

2812
01:58:38,080 --> 01:58:42,176
Release this on Fox Nation because Fox News wouldn't let him are it on his show

2813
01:58:42,432 --> 01:58:46,528
It's no more unhinged or offensive than anything else he Arizona regular basis

2814
01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:52,928
This was released on Fox Nation as a promotional campaign I'm a left-wing mainstream media backlash against doubtful of

2815
01:58:53,184 --> 01:58:54,464
S*** this documentary is

2816
01:58:54,976 --> 01:58:57,024
Please into the campaign at least a little bit

2817
01:58:58,048 --> 01:59:04,192
I don't want to seem like I'm trying to say the Tucker should be ignored or anything like that I'm just not confident the people in the mainstream media

2818
01:59:04,448 --> 01:59:07,776
The ability to address this kind of material without f****** up and

2819
01:59:08,288 --> 01:59:08,800
Socially just

2820
01:59:09,312 --> 01:59:09,824
Spread

2821
01:59:10,080 --> 01:59:11,360
The documentary to a wider audience

2822
01:59:11,616 --> 01:59:14,176
Yeah I don't know what to do I like that was

2823
01:59:14,432 --> 01:59:15,200
A big part of life

2824
01:59:15,712 --> 01:59:16,736
Walking away from this

2825
01:59:16,992 --> 01:59:17,760
Being a little bit like

2826
01:59:18,272 --> 01:59:20,064
I mean yeah you know

2827
01:59:21,344 --> 01:59:24,672
It doesn't seem like it would be too hard for media members to

2828
01:59:24,928 --> 01:59:26,720
To just go out and be like hey listen

2829
01:59:26,976 --> 01:59:29,280
So we watch this whole Tucker thing

2830
01:59:29,792 --> 01:59:35,936
Obviously all he's really trying to do Israel us up to get more viewers to his f****** web

2831
01:59:36,448 --> 01:59:37,216
Guess what

2832
01:59:37,728 --> 01:59:38,496
That's what Tucker

2833
01:59:38,752 --> 01:59:39,520
Not today

2834
01:59:39,776 --> 01:59:43,872
Like just say out loud on television not today Tucker

2835
01:59:44,384 --> 01:59:46,688
What do we say to the god of b*******

2836
01:59:46,944 --> 01:59:48,224
Not today

2837
01:59:48,736 --> 01:59:52,320
I feel like a fair amount of this

2838
01:59:52,576 --> 01:59:55,136
Especially the promotional campaign leading up to it

2839
01:59:57,952 --> 02:00:00,256
I don't know I don't know it

2840
02:00:01,024 --> 02:00:02,048
There's an interesting

2841
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:05,376
Element to it and that is Tucker

2842
02:00:05,888 --> 02:00:06,400
Bike spaces

2843
02:00:06,656 --> 02:00:07,680
Is just straight-up Infowars

2844
02:00:10,240 --> 02:00:11,520
The dignity above it

2845
02:00:11,776 --> 02:00:13,312
It is just the Tucker

2846
02:00:13,568 --> 02:00:14,080
Is

2847
02:00:14,848 --> 02:00:15,360
Less

2848
02:00:16,128 --> 02:00:17,408
Transparently nuts

2849
02:00:17,664 --> 02:00:18,176
Spitaliks

2850
02:00:18,688 --> 02:00:19,968
He doesn't fake crying and

2851
02:00:20,224 --> 02:00:20,992
Screaming and

2852
02:00:21,504 --> 02:00:22,016
Endive

2853
02:00:22,272 --> 02:00:23,552
Get red in the face and like

2854
02:00:24,064 --> 02:00:26,368
Talk about how he used to murder people and what have you

2855
02:00:28,160 --> 02:00:29,696
The same content and when you look at it

2856
02:00:29,952 --> 02:00:30,720
The same people

2857
02:00:30,976 --> 02:00:37,120
Alexander these are the same folks who are running their just moving up the

2858
02:00:37,376 --> 02:00:38,144
Lottery up now

2859
02:00:38,656 --> 02:00:39,168
So

2860
02:00:39,680 --> 02:00:40,192
I think Alex

2861
02:00:40,448 --> 02:00:41,216
Should be scared

2862
02:00:42,496 --> 02:00:44,800
Tucker should be scared too though cuz this is

2863
02:00:45,056 --> 02:00:45,568
Does not like

2864
02:00:46,080 --> 02:00:46,592
I don't

2865
02:00:46,848 --> 02:00:48,128
I don't think this is a road

2866
02:00:48,384 --> 02:00:48,896
Goes very

2867
02:00:49,408 --> 02:00:50,176
No it's

2868
02:00:51,456 --> 02:00:53,760
Kind of a flash-in-the-pan to try and do this

2869
02:00:56,064 --> 02:00:57,600
Like a normal TV

2870
02:00:58,112 --> 02:00:58,624
I mean

2871
02:00:59,136 --> 02:01:01,440
It is it blows me away again just

2872
02:01:01,696 --> 02:01:02,208
Because it's like

2873
02:01:03,488 --> 02:01:06,048
How long do you guys think that this is sustainable

2874
02:01:06,304 --> 02:01:08,608
It's not sustainable you can't Terrace Edge forever

2875
02:01:09,376 --> 02:01:10,656
It's going to explode

2876
02:01:11,168 --> 02:01:13,472
And you did it and it exploded on the 6th

2877
02:01:13,728 --> 02:01:16,032
And that was an opportunity to be like

2878
02:01:16,288 --> 02:01:17,312
Let's Tampa tape

2879
02:01:17,568 --> 02:01:18,336
Tamper this s***

2880
02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:20,896
And they leaned into it again

2881
02:01:21,152 --> 02:01:22,432
So it's going to happen again

2882
02:01:22,944 --> 02:01:25,760
And the idea that they are going to be able to come

2883
02:01:26,016 --> 02:01:26,528
Control it

2884
02:01:26,784 --> 02:01:27,552
Seam sewing

2885
02:01:27,808 --> 02:01:28,320
Sing to me

2886
02:01:29,856 --> 02:01:31,136
These kinds of

2887
02:01:31,648 --> 02:01:32,416
Tents

2888
02:01:32,928 --> 02:01:34,720
Situations and events

2889
02:01:34,976 --> 02:01:36,512
Will end up happening weather

2890
02:01:36,768 --> 02:01:37,792
It's by

2891
02:01:38,048 --> 02:01:39,840
People like Tucker and Alex

2892
02:01:40,864 --> 02:01:43,424
Facilitating it or buy them not

2893
02:01:43,936 --> 02:01:45,216
And Their audience turning against them

2894
02:01:45,472 --> 02:01:46,496
Because they're not hardcore.

2895
02:01:48,544 --> 02:01:49,312
Going to happen

2896
02:01:49,824 --> 02:01:51,360
It happens every time I

2897
02:01:51,872 --> 02:01:53,664
Believe that you would be that stupid

2898
02:01:54,176 --> 02:01:54,688
And

2899
02:01:54,944 --> 02:01:56,736
Egotistical to think no

2900
02:01:56,992 --> 02:01:58,528
Just because I've seen this play out

2901
02:01:59,040 --> 02:02:01,344
Over and over and over again throughout human history

2902
02:02:01,600 --> 02:02:02,880
I'm pretty sure I'll be able to

2903
02:02:03,136 --> 02:02:04,160
That to hang my hat on

2904
02:02:04,416 --> 02:02:04,928
Controlling B
