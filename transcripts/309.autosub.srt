1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alex

2
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:16,640
And talk a little bit about Alex

3
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:20,224
Have you ever

4
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:25,600
Glasses

5
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:29,696
Osborne

6
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:30,720
Was really young

7
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:32,512
And I have

8
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:33,536
Lacrosse

9
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:36,608
It remains to this day but that my vision was

10
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:38,912
When I was a boy

11
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:45,312
Oh yeah

12
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:51,712
Forgotten a fully straight answer on it

13
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:55,808
I just know that when I was like very young

14
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:57,088
I had multiple I search

15
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:01,440
Define butts

16
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,000
Middle School Junior High

17
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:07,584
I realized that my vision wasn't

18
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,888
Super Changed by wearing glasses

19
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:15,264
Let's cross

20
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,824
Okay I realize was kind of just a cosmetic

21
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:24,224
Okay okay so I talked to MyEyeDr I was like I don't think I want to wear these anymore

22
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,040
I keep breaking

23
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:32,672
It's no good

24
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:34,208
They're probably not going to do much

25
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:34,976
Search for you

26
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:35,744
Ustadz.

27
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:45,984
You say that to the doctor when I was younger

28
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,080
Agoura great deal but then my eyes grew

29
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:50,848
The problem

30
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:51,616
Fixed

31
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:53,664
Who were the eye surgeries work

32
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,736
I don't know

33
00:01:56,992 --> 00:02:01,856
Comparison

34
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:04,160
It's just your way of trying to announce to the audience

35
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:10,560
It's that you got glasses fishing for compliments

36
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:13,120
Before the show started

37
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:16,448
Entire head was

38
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:22,848
Cleared of everything when I was about to ask you a question I was like

39
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:31,808
I just looked around for something on your walls and I was like

40
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:38,208
I got to visit if I had a choice or if it were something that I didn't feel was

41
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:40,256
Just cosmetic I would probably

42
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,024
Go back

43
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,560
Can get glasses

44
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:44,608
They look good on a head General

45
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,472
Almost as good as on that ass

46
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:51,776
Right

47
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:02,016
Grab

48
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:07,904
The present is going on

49
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:08,928
Is Lifan

50
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:11,488
I get this answer the probably by the time is up

51
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:17,888
Episode comes out so sorry if

52
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:20,448
Yeah so today we're going to be going over.

53
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:25,824
1029

54
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,592
Nomad

55
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:29,152
What a what a time it was

56
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,944
This episode

57
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,504
When I was getting it ready

58
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:37,344
I thought it was going in One Direction and it definitely did

59
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:42,976
Entirely different it's a roller coaster ride

60
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:45,792
Some of it is unpleasant

61
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:48,864
Completely absurd

62
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,144
Deeply esoteric

63
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,192
Alright

64
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:55,776
The grab-bag a mixture of something for everybody

65
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:56,544
Except

66
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,592
For one very specific person

67
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:01,408
In this out of context drop from

68
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,176
Today Show

69
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:04,224
I'll just be honest I love my daughters

70
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,504
Where's my son

71
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:06,784
Who that's rough

72
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,088
You never like to hear parents say that

73
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:12,672
Man I guess I also that I'm coming from Alex

74
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:14,720
That means Rex's not masculine enough

75
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:17,536
Feels like it might be

76
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,607
Because Alex would be the guy

77
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:22,143
I need a son

78
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:28,543
Yeah I don't want to psychoanalyze

79
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:31,103
Other than to say like

80
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,639
That could do damage

81
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,663
Change to a child

82
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:40,063
Like hearing their parents National radio

83
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:43,903
No good

84
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:49,279
I mean

85
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:52,607
But you know there's a group of people

86
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,167
I cannot rate

87
00:04:55,423 --> 00:05:01,567
It's all equal amongst them

88
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:07,199
No not the walk symbol of the technocrats

89
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:09,759
Share the same positive feelings for me

90
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:13,855
And that is why we need to take a moment now before we begin this episode

91
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:19,487
First of all Gabriel thank you so much

92
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,023

Pleasure

105
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:03,007
Speaking a little bit with recently about my Santa

106
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,055
Use of living in an RV

107
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:08,383
So I thank you so much Mickey you are now a technical

108
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:20,671
Heroin

109
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:24,511
Freakishly large

110
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:31,935
Thank you so much for making anything like this showed

111
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:38,335
Going to our website

112
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:44,479
Jordan an episode of Fantasy Island

113
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:47,039
Just like okay here's an RV

114
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:53,695
Lalala

115
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:56,255
Fantasy Island goes well

116
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:03,423
It's supposed to be having but it turns out as hell

117
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:09,823
Open WhatsApp from hell's heart he's you want to be famous no you don't know

118
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,103
Don't

119
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:15,967
The entire show

120
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:18,015
And I had to do like

121
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:18,783
The final

122
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:21,855
And I kept

123
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:22,623
Being like

124
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:30,047
To the final later I got paid I'm literally confused Spanish

125
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:30,815
Excuse

126
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:33,887
Not to write term paper

127
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:36,959
It's right now

128
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,543
I watch the entire season

129
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:43,359
Where's the turnpike

130
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,895
Finish the term paper

131
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:49,759
Got it I don't know how I did it

132
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,807
Engaged

133
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:54,111
What's that what I called improvisational academic

134
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,647
For a large part of my

135
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,415
College career

136
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,679
Classes that I wasn't

137
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:08,959
Interested

138
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:10,239
Anytime you're in college

139
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,543
High School

140
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:13,567
Boston

141
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:14,591
Text to do

142
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:17,151
That stuff I found I can Bluff

143
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,175
Really

144
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:20,991
Today Jordan

145
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,783
Start on June 10th

146
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:26,879
Hey guess what we have a really familiar guest

147
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,671
Leaving things off

148
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:29,695
On Alex's show

149
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:34,815
Lawyers on with the Pepe the Frog

150
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:39,167
Exclusive on that that has

151
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,703
I love you

152
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:44,031
Wards.com

153
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:51,967
As well as the bottom of the hour

154
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:00,159
They spent 100,000 fighting them

155
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:06,815
So Alex is declaring victory

156
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:07,839
Matt Furey

157
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:14,239
Course of course I mean this is a very predictable turn up

158
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:19,103
Turning into Alex having

159
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:22,431
Conference call

160
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,479
Very weird also when they lose

161
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:27,295
The lawsuit does not mean they have

162
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,575
To pay the legal fees of

163
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:33,951
Not necessarily

164
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:38,815
Little bit

165
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:41,887
Also Alex

166
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:46,495
Fury had to pay a million dollars in legal fees

167
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:47,775
I really doubt that

168
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,311
Wonder where he's getting that information

169
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:52,639
Tantrum I wonder if we're going to find out later

170
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:58,015
Randazzo are coming up later

171
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,551
Before we do

172
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,343
Alex

173
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:04,159
Did something on this episode that I thought was really

174
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,207
I don't even know about it if I'd listened

175
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,023
Thousands of hours of his show

176
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:11,583
Brought back

177
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,631
The the fear that he has

178
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:14,911
About to be

179
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:17,727
The Muslim women in the pool supply shop

180
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:20,799
He brought that back not specifically

181
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,103
Structure of

182
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:25,151
People of various

183
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,199
Types of

184
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:30,015
People in places he doesn't want to see them

185
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:30,783
As adjuster

186
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,319
Application for lot of his

187
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,647
Analyst position

188
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:36,927
Here it goes again

189
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:39,487
Office yesterday

190
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:44,607
That's closed on Sundays

191
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,887
What is that

192
00:10:59,199 --> 00:10:59,711
In

193
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,135
Traditional

194
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:11,487
Guatemalan

195
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:20,447
You know what a water bottle looks like you know what it looks like

196
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:32,479
Parking lot

197
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,063
Why is this place

198
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:41,951
Do whatever the hell they want

199
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,743
Stories convoluted

200
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:49,887
Central and South America

201
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,519
I don't know how much that I can take as like

202
00:11:55,775 --> 00:12:00,127
Tru reporting

203
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,223
Not if

204
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:06,783
Joining the way people are dressed

205
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,575
For our actors

206
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:13,695
It seems like at Central and South American people are acting address

207
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,231
Also my dad owns a

208
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:16,255
Piece of a dental practice

209
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,535
Did I get the hookup at

210
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:24,959
Cracked tooth I saw people who were from Central and South America wearing clothes

211
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:27,519
So I got to tell you about it cuz they're not

212
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,055
That's f*****

213
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:36,479
I went to pool supply store I saw Muslim women

214
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:44,415
Hey I went to the dental office for having fun

215
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:47,999
This is an interface absolutely

216
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:50,815
How do you say grow up

217
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,679
There's literally a sentence

218
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:57,471
About what you're doing

219
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:00,031
That everyone says when you do this

220
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:02,079
Don't cover

221
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:08,223
Always have one immediate visual thing

222
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,759
And then they can

223
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:12,319
Extrapolate all of that in Central and South America

224
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:14,879
Different clothes

225
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:17,695
Here is everything that you f***** up in your

226
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,463
Entire history

227
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:24,863
Advocating for like he doesn't have any proof that these were there cars

228
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,655
Just buy the car they don't have the

229
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,423
Plate yet

230
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,727
He has no reason to suspect that like

231
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:34,079
Hahaha

232
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,639
Play I Don't Like

233
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,919
This

234
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,711
So what do you want to do regulate there

235
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:46,111
Clothes uniforms her

236
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:52,511
Are you saying I shouldn't be able to

237
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:58,399
The problem is the behavior that solve it is

238
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:01,215
But according to Alex South Austin

239
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:02,495
Is becoming a third world

240
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:04,287
Which

241
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,055
Great

242
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:11,711
But it wasn't

243
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:16,319
I would like to hear this looks like

244
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:19,647
He'll the sidewalks are all filthy

245
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:23,743
Trash cans overflowing

246
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:27,327
The collapse of civilization

247
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:32,447
We're not helping them for the third world we're becoming third world

248
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:39,103
Argument essentially boils down to like these immigrants that are coming in at Fern South Austin into 1/3

249
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,127
World country

250
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:45,247
Dirty diaper trash

251
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:49,087
Do you think people who litter

252
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:51,647
Every

253
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:58,047
Pretty sure it's only snow littering in rural areas no I've never seen any

254
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:00,351
Littering in rural areas

255
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,631
Again what

256
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,655
The complaint

257
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:09,311
Okay

258
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:12,639
You organize a citizen's group with those sticks

259
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:19,039
But is really sharp

260
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:25,439
Text so they have the money to repair those f******

261
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:28,767
Find a solution as opposed to finding someone to blame for it

262
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:35,679
Sir Leon

263
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:36,447
Comes along

264
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,727
With Mark Randazzo

265
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:45,151
In trying to present the

266
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,711
G1

267
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:53,343
Mad at Paul Joseph Watson

268
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,623
Because his headline

269
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:55,647
You wrote didn't

270
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,927
Enough

271
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,055
Okay

272
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,335
What you contradicted

273
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:16,127
Paul does what he wants

274
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:19,967
What to do

275
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:26,111
Lot of lot of freedom of expression over there

276
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:28,415
So I mean

277
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,439
Presentation

278
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,463
Major

279
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:31,743
Victory

280
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,583
So earlier Alex

281
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:36,863
Do you have to pay a million

282
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:37,887
And something dollars

283
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,191
Thousand

284
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,727
You very correctly

285
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:42,495
Predicted

286
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,519
The vet information

287
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,567
Just bullshitted Robert Barnes

288
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:46,335
Just guessing about

289
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:50,175
It would not surprise me at all if they spent over $1000000

290
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:53,503
It would not surprise

291
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,527
Prize me

292
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,319
That's again

293
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:02,463
Is Barnes going off of 1/2

294
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:06,303
That's a regular amount of money

295
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,351
Suspend on the lawyer

296
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:20,127
Interested in

297
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:25,759
So what's going on with the lawsuit and what Alex is doing with it and trying to

298
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:26,527
The claims for

299
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:32,927
Yeah that's going on it

300
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:33,951
You see how both sides

301
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:36,511
Can reasonably claim to have gotten what they want

302
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:40,095
It seems like a rare instance of a high-profile civil case

303
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,119
Reaching a DC

304
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,143
Conclusion

305
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,423
Thank you everyone

306
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:44,959
Except

307
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:49,311
And pretend that they unilaterally walk

308
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:54,175
In the past month Alex has been screaming about how he's not going to settle that lawsuit

309
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,455
He's going to fight

310
00:17:55,711 --> 00:18:00,319
He's gone on and on about how a Creator Matt furie tried to settle

311
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:03,903
For a small undisclosed amount but Alex said no on principle

312
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:07,999
If I know anything about Alex it's that he doesn't do courtroom

313
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,023
Unless he has to

314
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:13,887
Or unless he's in some kind of position where his businesses specifically off-limits

315
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:15,935
He has the opportunity to grandstand

316
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:17,215
Use the cord is a bully pulpit

317
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:21,311
So I knew that principle stuff was bulshit user putting on a brave face

318
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,871
Because he wasn't sure what he was on the hook for

319
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:24,895
And what you could be

320
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,687
Liable to end up paying

321
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:30,527
Siri probably initially offered a really high settled

322
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:36,671
Alex Presley promised to fight this which helped the Braves money for his legal battle

323
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:42,047
Became clear that the most Fury was going to win if you want to try was $14,000

324
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:44,095
Gladly paid the settlement of 15

325
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:44,863
Thousand

326
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:47,423
If he thought he possibly could win

327
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,191
And the most

328
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:48,959
She could lose was

329
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:50,239
$14,000

330
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:53,311
It makes no sense for him to settle for a higher amount

331
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:58,687
Especially given his previous behavior in last something about Discovery could be a problem

332
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:02,527
That $15,000 is a payoff for him not to have

333
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:03,551
The disclose is fine

334
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:05,343
Information in Discovery

335
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:09,183
Alex guitar lawsuit without being forced to show his internal working

336
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,463
So no matter what

337
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:13,023
You'd win that's great for him I'm happy for him

338
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,303
And as for Fury

339
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,887
What the lawsuit to get rich

340
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:19,167
Stop using this work

341
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:20,703
Promote a message

342
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:22,751
But he got that in the settlement to

343
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:25,823
The reason this became a lawsuit because Infowars

344
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:26,847
Used to order receipt

345
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,895
Request from him

346
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:31,455
To stop selling their poster with Pepe on it

347
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:33,503
If they just stopped is there wouldn't

348
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,039
Africa has been a lawsuit

349
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:38,111
And here in the settlement agreed to put a freeze on sales

350
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:41,183
Destroy all copies of the poster that they still haven't stopped

351
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:44,255
That's essentially what Fury wanted all along

352
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,023
Got it

353
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:47,327
In Fort Worth is no longer using the character

354
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,607
And if they do it again

355
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:50,143
You could use the settlement against

356
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:53,471
It's kind of a bummer that Alex can't just be an adult

357
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:56,287
Yep they made a mistake and ultimately

358
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:58,335
They reach the conclusion both sides are happy

359
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:02,431
That's not Alex's game because he is a big old adult baby

360
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,711
Can't Behave that way

361
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:06,527
He have to claim victory in every instance

362
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:07,807
Lesti

363
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:10,111
Lose some sort of appearance of mushy

364
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:10,879
She's MO

365
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:14,463
I want directions

366
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:19,583
Rex wouldn't fight sauce

367
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:23,167
Here's a thousand bucks just for your travels look good

368
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:26,239
That's a little thing that's missing from a lot of the coverage

369
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:32,639
The reason that settlement was higher

370
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:34,687
Is that you kind of trolling Alex

371
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:41,343
The 14,000 was the amount that the court deemed that Alex made selling the poster

372
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,623
Images of Fury could look

373
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,159
The settlement

374
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:45,183
15000

375
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:47,999
Instead extra thousand bear is a donation

376
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:52,095
The Frog

377
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:58,495
Poking fun at the guy who yells all the time but Heather turn the frogs

378
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:03,871
Kinda prologue

379
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:09,759
Really seems like that's probably just to f*** with Alex I would

380
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,623
Spilling victory

381
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:15,391
Temperature

382
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,720
Fight you may have made

383
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:24,608
He is

384
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:25,888
Being a real dick

385
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:29,728
Versabar in general court

386
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:34,080
The world

387
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:36,896
Strategic

388
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:40,480
Infowars

389
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:44,320
To get 10000 back

390
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:45,600
And we did this

391
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:47,904
Intentionally

392
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,184
Create the appearance

393
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,208
If you come against

394
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:51,232
This is what

395
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:54,560
You get financially decimated by trying to hurt

396
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:02,496
And I wants to insult

397
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:03,520
Theory

398
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:07,616
Entire legal process

399
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:09,920
He invalidates a lot of the ways that Alec

400
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:10,944
What's tries to prison

401
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:12,992
The first one

402
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,040
It really invalidates all of Alex

403
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:16,320
Because ideas about being

404
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:17,856
Upper-middle-class

405
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:23,232
Living the restraint

406
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:25,792
This is this is very much like

407
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,072
We're f****** rich

408
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:30,400
I don't give a f*** about $15,000

409
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:48,832
So that's

410
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:49,856
F***** up

411
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:50,624
Hilarious

412
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:57,024
That's reviewit to the audience a little bit of the internal workings

413
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:04,448
Behave

414
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,080
Give It Up

415
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:12,128
Well I'm trying to push back

416
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:25,184
Ignite Sao

417
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,304
Invalidates

418
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,072
The same

419
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:36,448
Sort of we spend money like crazy things and then also isn't

420
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:39,520
Isn't he supposed to be the good family man

421
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:41,056
Into all of this like

422
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:43,360
Zurvanism like I spend 50

423
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:45,920
Thousand dollars at a strip club

424
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,184
Yeah

425
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:00,512
I had a little part on Stankonia

426
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:06,400
Actually artificial member of the dungeon family

427
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:10,752
Mark run.

428
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:12,800
I recently suggested Robert Barnes

429
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:15,616
Just trying to make a name for himself as the lawyer of choice

430
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:18,432
For the right-wing dumb dumb free speech grifters of the world

431
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:20,224
The Cassandra Fairbanks

432
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,504
Is the Chuck Johnson

433
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,832
People that you've taken on his clients

434
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:28,160
There's a clear pattern that applies in

435
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:29,440
Content

436
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,304
If I was accurate at all

437
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,328
This episode

438
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:37,120
Here with Mark Randazzo

439
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:38,912
Robert Barnes together

440
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:39,680
Kind of a pan

441
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:40,960
Passing the Baton

442
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:41,728
And Subway

443
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:44,032
Mark Randazzo was Alex

444
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:44,800
Texas lawyer

445
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,944
But the judge rejected his request

446
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,992
Citing concerns about past quotes

447
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,528
Serious misconduct

448
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:56,320
Run is not lice

449
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:57,856
Practice in Connecticut

450
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:59,904
Apply to be an out-of-state

451
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:05,280
Which is often accepted just a matter of formality

452
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:06,304
But it wasn't

453
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,072
For him

454
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:09,120
Because he's shady is

455
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:12,448
Alex's lawyer Alex needed a replacement

456
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,728
Instepps Robert Barr

457
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:16,288
In the name of Defending free speech

458
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:19,872
Took on Android

459
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:22,176
As well as white nationalist Paul nehlen

460
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:27,040
White supremacist Euro Jared Taylor Mike cernovich Richard Spencer's booking agent

461
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,576
And gab the website where people

462
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:29,344
Go to f*****-up

463
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,928
Beyond that is a cup

464
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:34,208
Wheatley in ethical

465
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:35,488
Fraud of a lawyer

466
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:38,304
Used to be the in-house attorney for a foreign company

467
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,840
Recalled Liberty Media

468
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:41,632
Part of his job was to issue

469
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:44,192
Takedown notices to streaming to besides

470
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:46,496
His capacity as Liberties lawyer

471
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:48,032
He misrepresented himself to

472
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:49,568
The targets of these lawsuits

473
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:50,336
Does being outside

474
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:52,640
Cancel

475
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:53,920
From them to get them not to pray

476
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:55,456
Pursue legal action

477
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:58,528
He told the lawyer for the website

478
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:01,344
Quote 32b a little gravy for me

479
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:07,744
It has to be more than the 5,000 you were talking about before I'm looking for the cost of at least a new Carrera in

480
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,352
This weekend

481
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:14,912
I'm going to want at least used BMW mod

482
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:32,064
That's not a good way

483
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,136
Who's trying to be like

484
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:36,672
Some sort of financial

485
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,720
Possibly Pursuit

486
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:43,840
Even even though he was work

487
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:47,424
The other people

488
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,960
A hundred percent

489
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:54,592
Anatole is the worst

490
00:26:55,872 --> 00:27:01,248
He was later working on a settlement with or on a file-sharing company again

491
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:06,112
Liberty was looking for $550,000 and it runs its whole door on it

492
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:08,160
Him $75,000

493
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:11,744
Do you a quote never be able to sue them forever and ever

494
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:16,864
Eventually Liberty would get wise to March

495
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,680
Atlanta marks

496
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:26,080
Termination sequence $4000000

497
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:31,712
State and Liberty

498
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:33,504
$600,000 in Damages

499
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:37,088
The Arbiter that case found that market

500
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:39,136
M60

501
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:40,672
Association

502
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:41,696
Kingsborough bribe

503
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:43,232
Which lawyers are not

504
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:47,840
After all this it should make a lot more sense

505
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:50,912
My favorite lawyer of Nazis and white nationalist

506
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:57,568
Nowhere else to go nowhere else to go original hustle is obviously better and paid more but it blew up

507
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:03,968
But you know who definitely doesn't want to

508
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:07,552
People like Alex Jones

509
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:10,880
Ethical lawyer at all

510
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:12,160
Alex

511
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:15,232
You're obviously he's the kind of guy that Alex want represent

512
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:16,512
Kind of like

513
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:19,072
Went too far and like oh

514
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:20,096
Check

515
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:23,424
Connecticut won't let you be my lawyer I got to get Barn

516
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,848
I don't think he's even Alex's lawyer

517
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:33,920
Anymore he's on

518
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:36,224
He doesn't seem to want to be there

519
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,016
It sounds like you really doesn't want to be there

520
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:40,832
$50,000

521
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:45,440
Undercutting a lot of the point that Alex tries to make

522
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:47,232
Victimhood narrative

523
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,512
Whatever

524
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,584
From this experience

525
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:54,656
Going through this lawsuit

526
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:55,936
Dollars

527
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:58,240
That maybe you should

528
00:28:58,752 --> 00:28:59,520
Always

529
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:00,800
Pursue

530
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:01,824
Whatever lost

531
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,592
Suits,

532
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:03,872
I'd be an a****** about

533
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,944
There's a really interesting

534
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,136
Methylone

535
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:17,952
He's talking about his audience supporting him as long as he doesn't back down

536
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:21,792
Is the Home Depot account login

537
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:34,336
Before dishonor

538
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:38,176
We're going to Raging Bull

539
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:46,880
Absolutely

540
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,952
Robert Barnes just heard a cash register

541
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:56,096
A lawyer's advice

542
00:29:57,888 --> 00:30:04,032
Whatever I think to do and never consider the consequences

543
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:10,432
Billable hours

544
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:11,712
Supreme

545
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:17,856
There are no consequences

546
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:24,256
Wish you would have acted like that

547
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:26,304
If I was your lawyer back.

548
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:29,632
Yellow racial slur right if instead of settling

549
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:36,032
If Alex wound up suing Barnes Barnes

550
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:38,080
Capacity as your lawyer

551
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,872
If we were in my office

552
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:41,152
How to charge you

553
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:43,968
Right

554
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,904
Really does boil down to base

555
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:59,328
Declaring victory obfuscating at Alex's lawyers acting

556
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,888
Lawyers

557
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:05,216
How much you love

558
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:06,496
The free market

559
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:07,776
Which is great

560
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:09,056
But he's

561
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:10,080
Kind of

562
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,104
Maybe

563
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:12,128
Believe

564
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:15,200
Which is still a good thing but also like

565
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:15,968
Like maybe at the fish

566
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,272
Really matter

567
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,856
He ends up saying something

568
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:23,392
Directly contradict

569
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:24,672
He said

570
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:25,440
Bunch of time

571
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:30,304
Is Robert in love with free market

572
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:32,096
Different angle

573
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:42,848
Azusa

574
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:06,912
Because they were globalism a system

575
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:08,960
So he says that he's been

576
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:11,520
Third world countries in communist countries

577
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:14,080
He gives his Russia

578
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:16,384
And honestly I don't know what to make

579
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:21,504
In service of defending himself against

580
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:26,112
Alex's routine never been to Russia but it's a country

581
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:27,392
Take to go to someday

582
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:30,720
I'm not sure if any of this means anything other than ours can't keep a

583
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:31,744
The story straight

584
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,584
Cuz it really sounds like he's saying he's been to Russia

585
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,144
It's almost it's almost impossible to

586
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,984
Here pronoun reference working

587
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:43,520
I would bet

588
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:44,800
He hasn't been to Russia

589
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:51,456
Argument about how free markets great globalism

590
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:53,504
That seems like the simplest explanation

591
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:56,576
However

592
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:57,600
Has been to Russia

593
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:00,928
It calls into question all the times he said he's never been there

594
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,232
And why would he say that he's never been

595
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:04,768
Because he

596
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:07,584
Me neither Russian

597
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,288
So the only way

598
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:17,568
I don't know

599
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:20,384
Interesting to me all day in as much as

600
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:22,176
An anomaly and it doesn't make sense

601
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:23,712
Like there isn't a real

602
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:24,736
To lie

603
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:29,344
Embellish

604
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:32,160
Here in imply that you've been to Russia

605
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:35,744
I think he lies for the fun of it now just to see what

606
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,768
Get away with

607
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:40,352
I think he's just lying about everything

608
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:43,424
I don't even know what I'm saying

609
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,896
Barnes is cool

610
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:55,456
I definitely don't think Barnes is f****** with me

611
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:56,992
Means I have good

612
00:33:57,248 --> 00:34:00,576
Discernment store

613
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:02,880
So I thought that was strange

614
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:05,952
Feeling impatient that he

615
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:06,976
He's been to Russia when he's

616
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:09,024
He said that he hasn't

617
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:12,864
But it would have probably been like

618
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:16,704
Peoria

619
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:22,848
Russian

620
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:27,968
Directions to barely keep their country

621
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,504
The first

622
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:31,296
In the 20th century

623
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,600
21st century

624
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:36,928
Why is the dawn of the new millennium

625
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:37,952
Chris Rock

626
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:43,328
Example

627
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:45,376
Midol

628
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:51,008
Successful

629
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:54,336
Russia did

630
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,896
We saw all the other victories

631
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:59,456
We should we can do it better than that

632
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:05,344
A beautiful

633
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:07,136
What

634
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:08,416
What

635
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:09,952
What is he saying

636
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:12,768
I'd like you to try

637
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:14,048
Parts that busy

638
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:17,888
Can't make heads or tails

639
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:20,704
Cuz I don't think

640
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,984
In terms of him being like

641
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:24,800
Yeah well I'm in bed with Russians

642
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,592
We don't talk to

643
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:27,872
No

644
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:30,432
Much imply that

645
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:32,480
Deify

646
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:35,040
Idolizes

647
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:36,320
Some

648
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:38,368
Things about Russia that aren't

649
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,208
Just realize that

650
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:48,864
Though they did remove some of the oligarchs

651
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:52,192
To remain and they have the same amount of power

652
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:53,728
They just split it between

653
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:54,496
You were people

654
00:35:57,568 --> 00:36:00,128
Problem

655
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,456
He is right we do it bigger and better as

656
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:05,248
Star oligarchs

657
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:07,296
Differently

658
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:13,696
Yeah he wanted to know what he was talking about Donald Trump

659
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:16,768
Wonderful wonderful opportunity what is that mean

660
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:20,352
Does that mean the Heat

661
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:23,168
It doesn't dizzy kind of implying that Rush

662
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:23,936
Did help

663
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:27,264
Specifically it really does seem like

664
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,848
Opportunity

665
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,896
Right

666
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:39,808
The state of the country that's the most benign explanation

667
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:43,136
In a large amount of assistance in order to

668
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:45,952
State of the country is something you would describe as being opportunist

669
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:48,512
I would see that as being like

670
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:49,792
Insightful of the time

671
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:53,376
Opportunistic heavy sneaky

672
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:54,656
Connotation to it

673
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:58,240
Ads

674
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:01,824
I don't I don't know it's implying something real real f*****-up

675
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:04,128
Beautiful

676
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:06,176
The problem is

677
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:07,456
He never asked

678
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:10,528
Course

679
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:12,320
Sidetracked

680
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:13,600
About being an opportunist

681
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:26,656
God

682
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:37,920
Hey sweetheart

683
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:45,856
What

684
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:55,072
You got a problem

685
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:58,400
You're upset cuz whatever you're so jealous you got to do with

686
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:03,776
Okay

687
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:06,592
Okay

688
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:16,576
I think what if I'm understanding his definition in it and the way that it applies yet

689
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:17,856
To Trump being an opera

690
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:23,744
America is like a super hot girl

691
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:27,584
Hey baby

692
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:29,888
I am a lot like Alex Jones

693
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:35,264
In that I am lying to you right now and later on I walk

694
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:37,056
Yeah it does

695
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:39,360
Do you like exactly an analogy

696
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:40,640
He's making

697
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:43,456
Doesn't look good

698
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:44,992
It's really it's really

699
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,576
What's showing

700
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:50,880
His show is

701
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:56,256
Just wall-to-wall there's so many times

702
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,352
Better broadcaster would have sound

703
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:01,120
Better

704
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:04,960
The better for that you're hoping to make their without

705
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:06,752
Sounding like a real creep

706
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:10,080
Bizarre

707
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:18,528
Spirals even further from there which is why he doesn't explain what he means by an opportunist

708
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:19,552
Yeah cuz you just

709
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:21,088
Grandpa

710
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:21,856
This is

711
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:23,136
Just this is so

712
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,440
Did they destroy me

713
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,096
Because I'm focused on Justice

714
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,240
Americana

715
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:42,336
It's like a big sexy woman

716
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:55,136
Want to play

Got our ancestors.

722
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,272
Power

723
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,600

00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:31,488
Fast yeah better is a Mini-14 Americana

Really really feel like he just did that part on a

727
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,472
You know

728
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:47,872
Like that reminder that holds like a bounty on him saying you having sex with America

729
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:59,648
Okay how many times can you reference pulling open americana's

730

Founder thigh

731
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,512
It does feel that way

732
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:08,608
Billions are going to get killed in the end

733
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:16,800
Lord Rothschild

734
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:19,872
Well that's alright

735
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:31,136

You should take this fish from

743

I want them

744
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:25,151

You know I'm f****** Americana

747
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:45,631
The idea of the 1950s

748
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:47,423
We're going to go to the Stars

749
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:52,799
Commune with God but we can only do that if I can quickly murder the globalist

750
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,615
Give me a bunch of money so I can have

751
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:56,639

Even that like even whenever he's like ever have that dream

755
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:08,927
Somebody

No

757
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:17,119
No every time you give me an idea of what your dreams are

758
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:20,703
I'm in a fight

759
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:24,031
Or like I want to run and I can

Can't run limitation

761
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:28,127
In dreams

762
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:31,711
I can't remember the last time I had one

763
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:33,247
Forget something

764
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:34,783
Zach crazy

765
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:39,135
Bananas

766
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:45,791
Because I guess the f****** Americana just

767
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:46,815
Slides off my back

768
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:47,583
Now sure

769
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:48,863
Maybe it's a piece of

770
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:50,655
Me and Alex is psychology that's missing

771
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:56,799
Which is why you guys are connected on

772
00:43:57,055 --> 00:44:03,199
Some kind of superhero super villain

773
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:15,999
Throughout the day

774
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:17,023
End

775
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:19,839
I'm going to play this clip.

776
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:20,607
We'll discuss it

777
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:22,143
Really

778
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:23,423
Really really bad

779
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:30,335
Studio

780
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:39,807
Condo Central

781
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:41,343
For the second

782
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:44,159
Ebola outbreak

783
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:49,023
Emma Gretzky

784
00:44:56,703 --> 00:45:00,799
And they're really over 1000 in San Antonio

785
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:06,175
More phone calls

786
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:17,439
We are overwhelmed

787
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:20,255
The 200 people

788
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:23,583
So Alex has big narrative hear that he's pushing

789
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:29,471
Congratulations

790
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:30,751
Right real fun

791
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:33,567
His ideas are there he has a border

792
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:34,591
Patrol source

793
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:44,063
This Ebola narrative is really Alex's main talking point for the day I resisted cutting clips of it earlier in the show

794
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:48,927
Like it was just a slightly more specific version of The Immigrant

795
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:50,463
Disease narrative

796
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:54,303
A big part of his rhetoric

797
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:55,839
Flog a dead horse

798
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:58,911
Play every example

799
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:01,215
This was such a concert

800
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:04,799
Read being brought up through the show though I felt it was important to address it

801
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:06,847
Escalation

802
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:08,383
And the narrative quite a bit

803
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:13,247
For most of the show Alex is presenting the story is coming from a source that he has a nice

804
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:14,271
Border patrol

805
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:17,343
They tried to contact FOX News about it but foxes

806
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:18,623
Refuse to cover the story

807
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:23,743
Alex sees this as evidence that he's one of the last truthful and brave news outlets out there

808
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:30,143
Reality if any of the his backstory for this information is true it's way more likely to Fox realize that this

809
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:34,239
Insight militias and white nationalist near the border

810
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:37,823
Just start shooting black people and immigrants might be from the Congo

811
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:39,615
If any of what Alex is

812
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:42,175
What is a large source of contact in Foxboro

813
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:46,783
I see that is evidence that even Fox News might have a Line in the Sand

814
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:48,319
Whereas Alex.

815
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:50,879
What are the things that make salad

816
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:51,903
Incapable of Honor

817
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:53,951
Understanding how wrong about the story is

818
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:54,975
Is that

819
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:57,023
Cease all immigrants as one thing

820
00:46:57,535 --> 00:46:58,047
As opposed to

821
00:46:58,303 --> 00:46:59,839
Two people with individual stories

822
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:00,607
Experiences

823
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,399
If you'd even spend one second

824
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:05,215
Considering what these Congolese

825
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:11,615
Virtually impossible for any

826
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:12,639
To have Ebola

827
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:16,223
41 most of them traveled from Africa to

828
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:20,063
Cuba then to South or Central America

829
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:21,343
It's not a fast

830
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:22,879
Strip

831
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:24,415
Let's their home countries

832
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:25,183
Months ago

833
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:28,255
Thank you Basin. For Ebola is 21 days

834
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:32,351
So if any of them have caught Ebola before they left they would have died on their way

835
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:38,495
The package has been on their way to the US for months and none of the immigrants who arrived you are symptomatic of

836
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:41,823
Means they do not have Ebola

837
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:48,223
And I can say for certain that none of them were symptomatic because Alex is lying about the Immigrant sinapi

838
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:50,271
Antonio assist

839
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:53,087
City manager calling Bridge

840
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:53,855
Call services

841
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:55,135
I hope there was research

842
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:57,439
Refuse me and a master's in public health

843
00:47:57,695 --> 00:47:59,743
Is gone on the record

844
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:01,023
Have all quotes

845
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:03,839
Been screened by the federal government before being released

846
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:04,863
Into the United

847
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:09,471
She also points out that the idea that some that has some unwashed

848
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:11,007
People is absurd

849
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:14,079
Many of the people who arrived here as refugees are coming from

850
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:15,615
Prism higher vaccination rates

851
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:16,383
The parts of the

852
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:18,943
Where do earthquakes

853
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:21,247
To point out that there have been

854
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:22,527
Is with immigrants that Stephen

855
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:24,319
True but not the kind

856
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:25,087
Is worried about

857
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:28,671
Quote we are seeing what I characterize it's stress-related it'll

858
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:33,279
We're having some cold some upper respiratory infections

859
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:34,815
Express they've gone through on their way

860
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:36,607
But guess what

861
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:37,887
Fear is addictive

862
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:39,935
Narrative

863
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:41,215
Has a real contact

864
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:43,263
And that clip I just played

865
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:46,335
About that

866
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:48,383
In communication

867
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:50,175
His multiple news team

868
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:50,943
Teams down there

869
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:52,479
And what ended up happening

870
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:54,527
Is that his employees

871
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:56,063
Owen Shroyer particular

872
00:48:57,855 --> 00:49:00,159
Store Center began yelling at people about Ebola

873
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:04,767
Swirl around so aggressively that the city of San Antonio

874
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:06,303
Had to hold a press conference

875
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:07,583
To explain

876
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:08,863
People basic science

877
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:10,655
About how six months is longer than

878
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:11,679
21 days

879
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:14,239
These people aren't bringing a bolle to the country

880
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:15,519
That's stupid

881
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:16,799
Paranoid

882
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:17,823
Channel list

883
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:19,103
Nativist fear

884
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:20,895
Manifested

885
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:23,711
If you read some of the stories of these that I reckon

886
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:24,991
Do Jeezy Get kind of ascent

887
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:26,527
People that Alex

888
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:28,063
22c is Immortal threat

889
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:28,831
To your safety

890
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:31,903
Jean-Paul a Republican

891
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:33,695
Opponent of Joseph kabila

892
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:35,999
Who was known for his oppressive Crackdown

893
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:42,655
Call I was tortured I have a lot of bad memories of my life

894
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:44,703
That's what's up

895
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:47,007
Does Seacrest

896
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:48,031
PG status

897
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:50,079
Apologist

898
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:51,103
Story of

899
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:52,639
At least 350 immigrant

900
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:53,407
Two arrived

901
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:54,175
Tonio from

902
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:55,199
Africa this way

903
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:57,759
And unfortunately I can't tell you all their stories

904
00:49:58,271 --> 00:49:59,295
100

905
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:02,623
Percent certainty that none of their story is I have Ebola

906
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:04,671
These are

907
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:07,231
There are words strong enough for what Alex is doing

908
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:10,047
There's a danger to his rhetoric

909
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:10,815
He doesn't realize

910
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:13,631
Because if he knows what he's doing I can come

911
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:14,911
To no other conclusion

912
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:15,935
That he's trying to get these

913
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:19,007
Alex doesn't have some great stores

914
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:21,823
Every other source E-40

915
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:22,847
Time to get info from

916
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:26,175
Pretending to be a border patrol or something

917
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:28,735
F****** idiocy one of his interns found on 4chan

918
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:30,015
And what he's doing

919
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:30,783
Is

920
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:32,063
Supremely respond

921
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:34,623
This is white nationalism of a

922
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:36,159
Incredibly dangerous variety

923
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:38,463
If any of these immigrants are attack

924
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:39,999
Their blood is on Alex

925
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:42,815
I'd say that without

926
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:52,287
I've been saying that since

927
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:53,823
Restarted and one of the reasons

928
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:55,359
Take that

929
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:57,663
Is because Alex Goes On

930
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:13,535
Because our own

931
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:16,351
He's advocating for men with guns

932
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:17,631
To protect

933
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:18,655
Country from

934
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:20,191
These

935
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:20,959
Scourge

936
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:22,495
Gallagher

937
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:23,775
Warning people about

938
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:25,311
And this entire episode is

939
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:26,079
So much

940
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:26,847
About

941
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:30,943
Angolan

942
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:33,759
Immigrants that have come to San Antonio so

943
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:34,783
You know he's

944
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:36,831
It's very specific LeConte

945
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:38,367
You speak again

946
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:39,647
Men with guns

947
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:41,695
Protect us from these African

948
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:44,767
Immigrants that are come again they probably have Ebola

949
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:46,303
It's insane

950
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:50,143
Deep deep escalation

951
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:51,423
Exactly

952
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:56,543
Immigrants have diseases also attaches to

953
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:57,311
Ebola

954
00:51:57,567 --> 00:51:58,335
Fragger

955
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:00,639
It's frustrating

956
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:03,711
About this

957
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:04,735
Before but the fact

958
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,527
These assholes will never

959
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:07,551
Say what they want

960
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:09,599
You know he's just like

961
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:15,231
The government people with guns at the border

962
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:17,791
He won't stay the next part where he wants

963
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:20,351
What what he wants those

964
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:28,799
The people who try and get it

965
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:33,407
If you're going to do something so it becomes defensible to say those things

966
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:35,199
If you vocalize

967
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:35,967
The other part

968
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:37,247
And it just seems like

969
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:39,807
There's no other outcome that would

970
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:40,575
Satisfy

971
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:42,111
Nope there's just nothing

972
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:45,695
Do not like people who came over in that

973
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:46,975
I turned themselves in

974
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:50,559
What they're doing isn't illegal

975
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:53,887
It specifically

976
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:56,191
He's trying to

977
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:56,959
Basically

978
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:58,495
Create a normalized

979
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:02,591
He's probably already completely normal.

980
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:05,151
But the idea of immigrants to come in

981
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:08,735
Apply for Refugee status should

982
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:10,527
Yeah babe, into the country

983
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:14,367
Because it's an illegal encroachment of the country and they probably have diseases

984
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:20,511
Become airborne

985
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:23,583
Kangol

986
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:25,887
Trying to

987
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:26,655
Do that too

988
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:31,007
Yeah it sucks up its disgusting it seems like he wants to live in his

989
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:35,615
He wants Austin to have giant castles built all around

990
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:38,175
And then he wants Texas to have even bigger

991
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:42,015
And nobody gets in or gets out there people standing

992
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:43,295
Therapist

993
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:46,623
A metaphor of the Alamo

994
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:49,439
F****** disgusting so Alex

995
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:51,487
It's a ton of reporters out

996
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:52,255
I don't know

997
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:53,535
Is Owen Shroyer at the

998
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:56,095
I mean

999
00:53:56,351 --> 00:54:02,239
How many of them are really kind of just freelancing

1000
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:03,519
Freeway

1001
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:07,871
We'll get to her in a little bit

1002
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:12,735
The problem that is none of them are bilingual

1003
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:14,015
So they can

1004
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:17,599
I can't understand

1005
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:19,647
Are they of course

1006
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:20,927
Wow

1007
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:21,951
They did bring Google

1008
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:31,423
And I said use a Google Translator

1009
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:49,599
What are your fears

1010
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:52,927
Ebola

1011
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:56,767
He's Worthy

1012
00:54:57,279 --> 00:54:59,583
It's not

1013
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:01,375
Ebola

1014
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:03,935
Africans fleeing the Congo

1015
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:07,263
African Ebola

1016
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:09,567
Texas

1017
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:12,895
You don't but so what

1018
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:16,223
Even if it was true even if that

1019
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:18,015
It is

1020
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:22,111
As long as there's like control mechanisms in place

1021
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:25,439
You don't want the disease to spread

1022
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:28,511
We've been aware of the bowl of her long enough

1023
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:29,791
That

1024
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:30,815
People are checked

1025
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:33,375
It's not

1026
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:35,679
It's not as crazy

1027
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:36,447
Suggesting

1028
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:37,983
But the idea of it likes

1029
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:39,775
6 months ago

1030
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:41,823
The Congo or Angola

1031
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:43,359
Because they were afraid

1032
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:46,943
Outbreak

1033
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:52,319
Navigation

1034
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:54,879
They are in any way more likely

1035
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:59,487
Alex right now sees all these African

1036
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:00,767
Folk coming in

1037
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:03,839
They're coming into Texas

1038
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:07,679
And I don't

1039
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:11,519
I was afraid of Ebola

1040
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:14,591
Doesn't mean he's any more likely

1041
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:18,431
These refugees

1042
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:19,455
This is stupid

1043
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:20,735
Also I'm not going to accept

1044
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:22,015
Google Translate

1045
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:23,039
Result

1046
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:24,319
As

1047
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:25,087
Evidence of

1048
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:31,487
Even with help they can translate French

1049
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:33,023
Simple language

1050
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:37,119
I bet they don't know Spanish

1051
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:39,679
Absolutely

1052
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:40,959
America

1053
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:43,007
Yap is language

1054
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:49,407
How's the weather you have bilingual

1055
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:50,943
Another language

1056
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:53,503
The reasons why I think it's so

1057
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:54,783
Important to people

1058
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:57,855
I think it's a really good

1059
00:56:58,623 --> 00:56:59,391
2

1060
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:00,415
Be bilingual

1061
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:07,071
Even if you only white nationalist lunatics disagree

1062
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:12,447
You can do or not do

1063
00:57:13,727 --> 00:57:14,239
It really is

1064
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:15,007
Expand

1065
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:17,055
Your mind

1066
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:22,431
Not just because of the vocab all the practice of that

1067
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:23,711
How other people

1068
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:24,735
Express themselves

1069
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:26,015
There's a really impact

1070
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:26,783
Equality

1071
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:28,319
To learning other language

1072
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:32,415
Supported

1073
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:35,487
Arrowverse to it

1074
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:36,511
Does open

1075
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:39,071
Restart to

1076
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:41,119
Who cares I'm not going to get on a soapbox

1077
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:43,679
I'm in the next clip Alex

1078
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:44,447
Is complaining

1079
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:46,239
That no one else will cover this

1080
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:47,007
Stories

1081
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:48,543
Then I suspect

1082
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:49,311
Because no one

1083
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:52,639
Nearly as white nationalist

1084
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:53,663
Richarlison

1085
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:56,479
He'll just waiting

1086
00:57:56,735 --> 00:58:02,623
See how the test run on Alex's show go today after that

1087
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:05,951
And so Alex is talking about that and he brings in Mike Adams

1088
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:09,023
Man

1089
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:09,791
Mike

1090
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:11,327
Is so f*****

1091
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:13,119
What he says in his neck

1092
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:14,143
Xclip is like

1093
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:16,191
Hey glad you got kicked off Facebook

1094
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:17,215
Prick

1095
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:20,799
Border patrol

1096
00:58:21,055 --> 00:58:22,591
Call me

1097
00:58:26,943 --> 00:58:28,479
Azan

1098
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:32,319
From the psychological

1099
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:35,647
Hear something

1100
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:40,255
This Invasion this is an invasion of America

1101
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:43,839
With what

1102
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:46,911
Censorship

1103
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:53,055
Vaccine truth information

1104
00:58:57,663 --> 00:59:03,295
This break is being engineered to happen

1105
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:06,879
And then they have to completely control the narrative so that no one

1106
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:08,159
Income online

1107
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:16,351
Absolutely

1108
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:17,631
So

1109
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:19,423
I think there is no

1110
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:20,959
Worst

1111
00:59:22,751 --> 00:59:23,775
People who

1112
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:24,799
Seeking Refuge

1113
00:59:25,055 --> 00:59:25,823
OG status here

1114
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:29,151
Call them a bio-weapon invasion

1115
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:31,711
Because what do you do

1116
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:36,063
What do you do with an illness you trying to

1117
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:38,879
QuickBook

1118
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:40,671
Look at the country as a body

1119
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:43,743
Write this illness

1120
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:47,583
You have to get antibodies to that

1121
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:49,631
What is that

1122
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:51,167
Man with gun

1123
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:53,983
But this sort of language

1124
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:54,751
This context

1125
00:59:55,263 --> 00:59:56,543
Absolutely

1126
00:59:57,311 --> 00:59:59,359
I mean they have the right to say I thought

1127
00:59:59,615 --> 01:00:00,127
I mean

1128
01:00:00,383 --> 01:00:02,431
What they should know

1129
01:00:02,943 --> 01:00:03,455
I hope

1130
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:06,015
There's consequences

1131
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:09,087
It's almost like

1132
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:10,623
I want

1133
01:00:11,135 --> 01:00:12,159
I want radio listener

1134
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:13,183
To have cookie

1135
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:14,719
Like you know like

1136
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:16,511
What's what how many

1137
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:19,839
Directly traceable cookies can we get back to Alex

1138
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:21,375
Mike Adams

1139
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:24,191
No I mean

1140
01:00:24,447 --> 01:00:28,543
It seems like a People's Choice winner Ben Shapiro

1141
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:30,591
The inspiration Spire terrorism

1142
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:35,967
Those people still want to Alex

1143
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:39,295
Yeah I don't know it

1144
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:41,087
It's not it's not fair for us

1145
01:00:41,343 --> 01:00:43,647
To fully blame or already

1146
01:00:45,695 --> 01:00:47,743
Exist

1147
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:50,047
A universe

1148
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:52,351
Consumption

1149
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:53,887
This is

1150
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:55,423
Zuri radicalizing

1151
01:00:56,703 --> 01:00:57,983
It's very scary

1152
01:00:58,239 --> 01:00:58,751
Who's calling

1153
01:00:59,263 --> 01:01:00,287
All immigrants

1154
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:01,823
Stating

1155
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:06,175
Same

1156
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:07,711
That is the least pass

1157
01:01:10,015 --> 01:01:10,783
Yeah

1158
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:12,831
Mike is one of these dudes

1159
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:13,599
2 who like

1160
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:17,183
Pay more attention

1161
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:19,743
Especially recently

1162
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:21,279
The times

1163
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:23,839
He's the one who's pushing Alex

1164
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:25,375
Like what

1165
01:01:25,631 --> 01:01:26,911
He came on and talked about

1166
01:01:27,423 --> 01:01:29,983
Trump declaring a state of emergency

1167
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:38,943
He was the one who was pushing for like we need to lock up our enemies

1168
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:39,711
Bored with that

1169
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:42,783
But Mike was the one who was making it okay for Alex

1170
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:45,087
Tubi

1171
01:01:45,343 --> 01:01:46,367
Yeah who's spearheading it

1172
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:54,559
Luther Royal biochemical but Mike's the one was overtly saying

1173
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:55,583
Yeah

1174
01:01:59,167 --> 01:01:59,935
About

1175
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:03,007
Lola

1176
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:06,591
Everybody who

1177
01:02:06,847 --> 01:02:07,359
You knows anything

1178
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:09,407
You understand the situation

1179
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:11,967
Basically

1180
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:14,783
Issaquah

1181
01:02:15,551 --> 01:02:16,831
In the mainstream media

1182
01:02:17,087 --> 01:02:18,879
When they say it's real it's fake

1183
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:19,903
When they say it's fake

1184
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:23,999
It's real that's exactly what we're witnessing now

1185
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:26,303
Wow

1186
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:29,375
That's called thinking poorly yeah you are

1187
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:36,799
Group of people's Pride themselves on

1188
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:38,335
Something like that

1189
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:39,103
Because

1190
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:41,919
Why is not true

1191
01:02:42,431 --> 01:02:43,967
So you just do that

1192
01:02:44,991 --> 01:02:47,039
Someone says that you just got to walk away

1193
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:52,415
Oppositional Defiant 211

1194
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:54,719
You can't how do you live

1195
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:55,999
I think he's

1196
01:02:56,255 --> 01:02:57,279
Gaslighting

1197
01:02:57,791 --> 01:03:01,375
Someone

1198
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:02,399
Maybe Jesus

1199
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:04,447
Show years ago

1200
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:06,751
There was some Ebola

1201
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:08,287
2

1202
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:13,663
Taking care of incredibly soft

1203
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:14,431
Globalist worth

1204
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:15,455
Thwarted once

1205
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:16,479
Again by Alex

1206
01:03:16,991 --> 01:03:18,271
Silk and now they're going back

1207
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:20,063
It could be

1208
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:27,231
I know from researching that because we did that episode

1209
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:28,511
The coverage of the 23rd

1210
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:31,839
Outbreaks

1211
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:34,399
That media was covering

1212
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:37,983
I know that people were talking about it

1213
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:41,311
Team

1214
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:42,079
You covered it up

1215
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:42,847
Back then

1216
01:03:43,103 --> 01:03:45,407
Which I can say categorically is not true

1217
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:46,175
Here's Alex

1218
01:03:51,551 --> 01:03:57,695
George York

1219
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:11,263
And everyone else will cover it up

1220
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:13,567
Not true at all

1221
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:18,431
Were the media to cover it

1222
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:20,479
Mike Adams would assume that it was not

1223
01:04:21,247 --> 01:04:22,783
It would have to be

1224
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:25,599
Yeah

1225
01:04:25,855 --> 01:04:27,391
Making arguments

1226
01:04:29,439 --> 01:04:30,207
Like distrust

1227
01:04:30,463 --> 01:04:33,791
They pretend it's a healthy distrust reality

1228
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:38,655
Alexandra

1229
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:39,679
Spliff

1230
01:04:39,935 --> 01:04:41,727
This is the last one from

1231
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:46,079
Look deeply irresponsible

1232
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:47,871
Characterizing

1233
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:51,199
Why

1234
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:55,551
With the captured federal government

1235
01:04:57,087 --> 01:05:00,415
Alone

1236
01:05:00,671 --> 01:05:02,207
Congo

1237
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:05,535
What is the second largest

1238
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:06,815
Outbreak

1239
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:12,191
Baby just a f****** life

1240
01:05:12,447 --> 01:05:15,007
Wandering around

1241
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:17,567
It's not 300,000

1242
01:05:17,823 --> 01:05:20,639
Thousand last year

1243
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:23,711
Wandering around

1244
01:05:24,991 --> 01:05:26,527
If you are someone who believes

1245
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:32,671
And you believe these people might have Ebola and there's thousands of them wandering around

1246
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:34,463
How do you know if someone that

1247
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:38,047
You see wandering around San Antonio is a

1248
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:39,839
Immigrants

1249
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:40,607
The Congo

1250
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:44,447
Their skin

1251
01:05:44,959 --> 01:05:45,983
I mean

1252
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:47,007
It does leave

1253
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:49,567
To suspicions of everybody who might

1254
01:05:49,823 --> 01:05:55,967
From the Congo

1255
01:05:56,223 --> 01:06:00,831
The Congo person wandering around San Antonio is now officially according to Alex

1256
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:01,855
Suspicious

1257
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:09,023
Every single black person walking around

1258
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:10,559
We need to be safe

1259
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:13,375
Every black person

1260
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:15,679
I understand I understand

1261
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:19,007
Fully that that's not what Alex is saying

1262
01:06:19,263 --> 01:06:20,031
He's implying

1263
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:21,567
That's what's been

1264
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:23,871
The rhetoric that you putting out

1265
01:06:24,127 --> 01:06:24,639
Any height

1266
01:06:24,895 --> 01:06:25,663
Much like that

1267
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:28,735
You do you need guns on the border

1268
01:06:28,991 --> 01:06:32,831
He's avoiding staying the part that is the real world application

1269
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:36,671
On the Border stopping immigrants

1270
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:38,719
You are wanting them to be shot

1271
01:06:38,975 --> 01:06:41,279
If they try and enter the country

1272
01:06:41,535 --> 01:06:46,911
These people wandering around San Antonio you want everyone to be suspicious of anyone who looks like they might be a

1273
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:47,935
That's

1274
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:48,959
What you're doing

1275
01:06:49,215 --> 01:06:53,567
Especially in the context of today where he's talking about men with guns on the border

1276
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:56,127
There are border militias with

1277
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:57,663
Guns

1278
01:06:57,919 --> 01:06:58,431
Kill people

1279
01:06:58,943 --> 01:07:02,783
We need we need to monitor every black person in San Antonio

1280
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:07,135
All the f****** time

1281
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:11,999
So we get to the 11th

1282
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:14,815
I studiously avoided trying

1283
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:15,583
Play n

1284
01:07:16,351 --> 01:07:17,375
Rainbow snatch

1285
01:07:17,887 --> 01:07:20,191
Material belly Weavers

1286
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:21,471
Character that you.

1287
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:23,775
I believe one forgot the adjectives

1288
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:27,359
Brilliant

1289
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:34,015
You don't know Millie Weaver is an employee of Alex Jones

1290
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:37,599
What she believes is some sort of a parody of feminism and the last

1291
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:43,231
Successes of the lgbtq community or something

1292
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:45,023
More more

1293
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:47,071
It's usually pretty dumb

1294
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:48,863
So she went out to Pride

1295
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:52,191
I want you to put your mic down

1296
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:53,983
This is going to make you a little bit like

1297
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:55,775
Screaming possibly

1298
01:07:57,311 --> 01:07:58,847
Your what is Herb it is

1299
01:07:59,103 --> 01:07:59,871
She goes out the

1300
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:07,295
Viewer discretion

1301
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:54,143
Seems to be highlighting Mike Pence's homophobia

1302
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:55,423
It seems to be

1303
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:59,007
Taking his hatred of gay people as a virtue

1304
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:01,055
It's like oh yeah you want to impeach

1305
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:02,847
Guess what you get then

1306
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:04,383
It's almost a threat

1307
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:07,967
Billy weird for a bit

1308
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:10,271
Normally you probably want to be like

1309
01:09:10,527 --> 01:09:13,343
Mike Pence doesn't hate gay people

1310
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:14,623
Traditional Values

1311
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:15,903
But this seems to be making

1312
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:18,207
Millie Weaver at least

1313
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:20,767
Is very conscious of the fact

1314
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:22,559
That should

1315
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:23,327
Be president

1316
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:26,399
Things would be very bad for the lgbtq community

1317
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:27,935
And she's wielding that

1318
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:30,495
Almost as a trump card guy just like

1319
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:33,055
You you think you want Trump impeached

1320
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:35,103
Be careful what you wish for jerk

1321
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:35,871
Yeah

1322
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:38,687
I'm confused

1323
01:09:38,943 --> 01:09:39,455
Is she

1324
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:40,479
Parroting

1325
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:45,855
Cuz she's almost more an effective parody

1326
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:47,647
Of what the heart rate

1327
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:48,415
Thanks

1328
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:51,231
They are parrot trust me

1329
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:51,999
Cheesin

1330
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:04,543
Ann Coulter

1331
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:06,335
Brilliant parody

1332
01:10:06,591 --> 01:10:08,895
Commentary

1333
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:10,943
Are they can always go

1334
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:13,759
Just don't think it's well-thought-out cuz there is probably

1335
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:14,783
Some kind of

1336
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:19,391
Bet you could do along the lines that might have something

1337
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:21,183
District

1338
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:22,975
Like it really just seemed

1339
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:23,743
Like

1340
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:25,279
Piano

1341
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:26,303
I don't

1342
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:27,071
Trump impeach

1343
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:30,911
If you get weed

1344
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:31,679
You want

1345
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:33,727
Your survival is at risk

1346
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:34,495
Yeah

1347
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:36,287
It's f***** up is there a

1348
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:44,991
That's what the plan was to go to the pride parade

1349
01:10:45,247 --> 01:10:46,783
I'm pumped.

1350
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:48,063
You want Trump impeach

1351
01:10:48,575 --> 01:10:50,623
And they go yeah and then she says

1352
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:51,903
You love Mike Pence

1353
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:58,303
What you trying to catch them knowing like a like a Snowman on the street

1354
01:11:03,167 --> 01:11:05,471
Get people excited about Trump

1355
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:09,567
Down to earth with the

1356
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:12,383
What don't you know that pain to be president then

1357
01:11:12,895 --> 01:11:13,919
Which is

1358
01:11:16,479 --> 01:11:19,039
Yeah and also there's a fundamental thing that's like

1359
01:11:21,087 --> 01:11:22,367
People are drunk atolls

1360
01:11:22,623 --> 01:11:24,159
Street festivals and things like that

1361
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:26,975
If you're going out and you're like I'm trying to do is

1362
01:11:27,231 --> 01:11:28,767
Serious piece of reporting

1363
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:32,607
People are sucked out they don't want to I want to talk to you

1364
01:11:32,863 --> 01:11:34,399
I caught them

1365
01:11:34,911 --> 01:11:40,543
Not realizing it a drunk exuberance

1366
01:11:41,311 --> 01:11:42,335
Cares what point do you make

1367
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:46,943
Is bringing up Mike Pence's homophobia

1368
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:50,271
Not celebrating

1369
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:57,183
It's very weird that I think we can all agree on

1370
01:11:59,231 --> 01:12:00,255
Are Hollow ground

1371
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:04,607
Man on the street interviews during a parade

1372
01:12:04,863 --> 01:12:11,007
Just have a great time no political b******* those organizers

1373
01:12:11,263 --> 01:12:13,311
Press passes

1374
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:14,591
But it's very hard to

1375
01:12:14,847 --> 01:12:19,711
Controlled flow people end up generally being able to skirt those rules

1376
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:21,247
Especially if you're just recording online

1377
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:25,855
Like an iPhone

1378
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:28,927
Nope can't you just love me

1379
01:12:29,183 --> 01:12:30,463
The world's greatest

1380
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:31,487
Satirist

1381
01:12:31,743 --> 01:12:34,303
Mark Twain of our time

1382
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:38,655
Alex

1383
01:12:38,911 --> 01:12:39,935
African immigrants

1384
01:12:41,215 --> 01:12:41,727
Nonsense

1385
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:45,311
Escalated

1386
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:47,359
Alex's in a really f***** up mood

1387
01:12:48,127 --> 01:12:48,895
Episode

1388
01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:52,479
Cuz there's a little bit of video that Alex plays of someone

1389
01:12:52,991 --> 01:12:53,759
Like pushing it

1390
01:12:54,015 --> 01:12:54,527
Camera away

1391
01:12:54,783 --> 01:12:57,087
Doesn't want to be on

1392
01:12:57,343 --> 01:12:57,855
Anselm

1393
01:12:58,111 --> 01:12:58,623
This

1394
01:12:58,879 --> 01:12:59,391
Really

1395
01:12:59,647 --> 01:13:00,159
Really

1396
01:13:01,695 --> 01:13:07,071
Stitches The Incredibles

1397
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:13,983
Reporters

1398
01:13:15,007 --> 01:13:21,151
Congo Ebola

1399
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:40,863
Nothing about any of the information

1400
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:41,631
Sweetheart

1401
01:13:41,887 --> 01:13:42,399
Indicate

1402
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:44,703
Please adjust projector

1403
01:13:49,567 --> 01:13:51,359
Thing to put on

1404
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:53,407
Information

1405
01:13:53,663 --> 01:13:58,527
Now I mean if you had videos I've been like

1406
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:06,463
This is just Alex's

1407
01:14:07,231 --> 01:14:08,255
Through

1408
01:14:08,767 --> 01:14:09,535
Replacement

1409
01:14:10,303 --> 01:14:12,863
Demographic replacement nonsense

1410
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:14,399
Really

1411
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:15,935
Driving train

1412
01:14:16,959 --> 01:14:17,471
Bucked up

1413
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:19,519
Cheese

1414
01:14:20,799 --> 01:14:26,943
Hypocrisy I hate it but remember when

1415
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:27,967
Publican

1416
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:32,319
Congressman beat the s*** out of a guardian journalist

1417
01:14:32,575 --> 01:14:36,927
I do seem to recall Alex B100

1418
01:14:38,463 --> 01:14:41,791
Overjoyed was just like hey can you not feel me

1419
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:48,447
To how deep out

1420
01:14:49,215 --> 01:14:49,727
To this whole

1421
01:14:50,495 --> 01:14:53,055
This whole look like

1422
01:14:56,127 --> 01:14:56,895
Me feel unwell

1423
01:14:57,663 --> 01:14:58,687
It gave me a little bit of a

1424
01:14:58,943 --> 01:14:59,455
Flutter and AFib

1425
01:15:00,991 --> 01:15:01,503
I just think he's

1426
01:15:02,271 --> 01:15:04,319
There's something really f***** up going on in

1427
01:15:04,575 --> 01:15:06,111
On the 11th

1428
01:15:13,791 --> 01:15:16,863
Congo Community groups

1429
01:15:17,119 --> 01:15:19,935
Thousands are coming get ready for it

1430
01:15:27,871 --> 01:15:28,639
Where's my clipboard

1431
01:15:28,895 --> 01:15:29,919
I've got that Kongo Klub

1432
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:33,247
60 clubs here

1433
01:15:35,295 --> 01:15:37,087
Local Congolese family

1434
01:15:37,343 --> 01:15:39,647
Try to make a sound secret-spilling home

1435
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:42,463
So what thousands more come

1436
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:43,743
Millions,

1437
01:15:43,999 --> 01:15:44,767
Oh no

1438
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:46,815
No no no

1439
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:49,119
You going to

1440
01:16:10,879 --> 01:16:11,391
Dodge

1441
01:16:11,903 --> 01:16:16,255
You are done long ago for you

1442
01:16:16,767 --> 01:16:17,791
You stupid a******

1443
01:16:18,303 --> 01:16:22,143
Couple things that really Disturbed me about that first of all the voice obvious

1444
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:24,191
Then the editorializing

1445
01:16:24,447 --> 01:16:26,495
Somebody does within that voiced really f***** up

1446
01:16:26,751 --> 01:16:29,311
The idea that African immigrants

1447
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:31,871
Coming in now would ask for reparations

1448
01:16:32,383 --> 01:16:32,895
Kind of silly

1449
01:16:33,919 --> 01:16:35,967
I think he's trying to distort that

1450
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:36,991
Entirely

1451
01:16:37,503 --> 01:16:39,551
And then beyond that

1452
01:16:40,575 --> 01:16:41,343
Hear an echo

1453
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:43,903
And it really drove home

1454
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:44,671
He's in a much worse

1455
01:16:45,695 --> 01:16:49,279
Yeah you know that the sound quality of the show is diminished

1456
01:16:50,047 --> 01:16:52,095
Is an echo when he starts yelling

1457
01:16:52,607 --> 01:16:54,655
This is not his professional studio anymore

1458
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:56,959
I doubt there's a there's a

1459
01:16:57,215 --> 01:16:57,983
From quality to it

1460
01:16:59,519 --> 01:17:01,567
Angrier and angrier

1461
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:02,591
Descend

1462
01:17:03,103 --> 01:17:04,127
To worse and worse

1463
01:17:04,383 --> 01:17:04,895
Environ

1464
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:08,479
The people who assume that minorities

1465
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:10,271
People so much

1466
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:12,575
Probably only do it

1467
01:17:12,831 --> 01:17:14,111
Because they're so awful

1468
01:17:14,367 --> 01:17:15,391
That they are hated

1469
01:17:15,903 --> 01:17:18,207
It's not like everybody hates white people

1470
01:17:18,463 --> 01:17:18,975
Is that you guys are

1471
01:17:19,743 --> 01:17:22,047
Yeah if you deserve it

1472
01:17:24,351 --> 01:17:24,863
He's group

1473
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:27,167
Why wouldn't they

1474
01:17:28,703 --> 01:17:29,215
Where at

1475
01:17:29,471 --> 01:17:31,775
Opposition in the

1476
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:36,895
So it was nice web Alex makes it really over it so much of his

1477
01:17:37,663 --> 01:17:39,967
Is about this Democrat

1478
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:40,735
Replacement ID

1479
01:17:41,759 --> 01:17:42,783
This is all just

1480
01:17:43,295 --> 01:17:46,111
It appears that these Africans are going to come in and vote Democrat

1481
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:50,975
Which he talks about all the time but it doesn't bear mentioning

1482
01:17:51,487 --> 01:17:52,767
It's so f***** up

1483
01:17:53,791 --> 01:17:58,399
But it's become so normal as a piece of Alex's rhetoric that it's almost boring

1484
01:18:00,959 --> 01:18:02,751
Yeah yeah yeah

1485
01:18:03,263 --> 01:18:05,311
Reminding

1486
01:18:11,455 --> 01:18:13,759
By the Millions

1487
01:18:22,207 --> 01:18:23,487
What happened

1488
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:26,047
So

1489
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:36,543
Nationalism stuff won't be allowed to run everything and run

1490
01:18:36,799 --> 01:18:40,127
Break everything that they want to end

1491
01:18:40,383 --> 01:18:42,687
How can we allow that

1492
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:49,343
How do you not know that your

1493
01:18:49,599 --> 01:18:50,879
You know you're awake

1494
01:18:51,135 --> 01:18:52,415
You eat knows that he's a white man

1495
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:57,279
Why

1496
01:18:59,839 --> 01:19:00,863
Nationalist

1497
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:07,263
Yeah yeah with the ideas of what's going

1498
01:19:07,775 --> 01:19:08,799
Naive

1499
01:19:09,055 --> 01:19:09,567
Stupid

1500
01:19:09,823 --> 01:19:10,591
Whatever it is

1501
01:19:11,103 --> 01:19:12,127
Willingly

1502
01:19:13,919 --> 01:19:15,967
Whatever it is it's a it's a lack of

1503
01:19:16,223 --> 01:19:17,247
Caring about getting

1504
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:18,015
Engaged

1505
01:19:18,783 --> 01:19:19,807
The actual

1506
01:19:21,599 --> 01:19:22,367
What's actually going on

1507
01:19:26,207 --> 01:19:28,767
And the f*****-up miss about

1508
01:19:29,023 --> 01:19:33,375
More evident in the I mean the shity voice was racist

1509
01:19:33,631 --> 01:19:36,447
Put the start of that is just literally

1510
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:37,727
Woman

1511
01:19:37,983 --> 01:19:39,519
Tries to help write

1512
01:19:44,895 --> 01:19:48,479
The story is a Congolese woman who lives

1513
01:19:48,735 --> 01:19:50,783
America knows more people

1514
01:19:51,295 --> 01:19:52,831
Country-of-origin are coming

1515
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:54,879
Wants to make them feel welcome

1516
01:19:55,647 --> 01:19:56,671
Alternative

1517
01:19:56,927 --> 01:20:00,255
Please respond

1518
01:20:00,511 --> 01:20:02,047
Congolese immigrants

1519
01:20:02,303 --> 01:20:04,607
Made to feel not welcome

1520
01:20:04,863 --> 01:20:07,679
Exactly treated like scourge

1521
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:14,848
It's f***** up really like his Congolese woman trees other Congolese immigrants

1522
01:20:15,104 --> 01:20:19,456
Or better headline for Alex

1523
01:20:20,736 --> 01:20:22,272
People shot at border

1524
01:20:25,856 --> 01:20:26,880
So

1525
01:20:27,392 --> 01:20:28,416
There's a big thing happens

1526
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:29,184
The 11th

1527
01:20:30,464 --> 01:20:32,000
Rodger Stone comes back

1528
01:20:32,512 --> 01:20:36,096
What quarter about his case but that doesn't mean

1529
01:20:36,352 --> 01:20:37,376
Talk about

1530
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:40,704
You can talk all he wants publicly he just

1531
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:41,472
Talk about

1532
01:20:41,728 --> 01:20:47,872
His case and anything that's related to it

1533
01:20:48,128 --> 01:20:49,152
Shut his mouth

1534
01:20:49,408 --> 01:20:52,736
About things that involve Mueller the investigation

1535
01:20:52,992 --> 01:20:53,760
His own case

1536
01:20:54,272 --> 01:20:55,808
Any offshoot of that cave

1537
01:20:56,064 --> 01:20:56,832
WikiLeaks

1538
01:20:58,112 --> 01:20:59,648
Jerome corsi I assume

1539
01:20:59,904 --> 01:21:02,464
Randy credico

1540
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,536
Publicly

1541
01:21:05,792 --> 01:21:07,328
And that's what you want to be

1542
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:13,984
Yeah yeah for a long time because

1543
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:16,288
Even if we had you on to talk about anything

1544
01:21:16,544 --> 01:21:17,568
You would immediately be like

1545
01:21:18,336 --> 01:21:20,896
Yeah I know I understand

1546
01:21:21,152 --> 01:21:23,200
Cyrillic

1547
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:24,224
That's what you assumed

1548
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:29,344
We find out that there's a psycho drama going on

1549
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:30,880
This interview is

1550
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:31,648
Tents

1551
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:34,464
Bizarre

1552
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:36,256
And I think it leads Alex to start

1553
01:21:37,024 --> 01:21:38,048
But we'll get to that when we get

1554
01:21:38,816 --> 01:21:39,840
Here is Alex

1555
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:41,632
Welcoming Rodger Stone

1556
01:21:43,424 --> 01:21:44,192
Rodger Stone

1557
01:21:51,872 --> 01:21:53,408
A person's good to see your face

1558
01:21:53,664 --> 01:21:56,992
Breaking your silence now

1559
01:22:20,544 --> 01:22:21,568
For this segment

1560
01:22:21,824 --> 01:22:24,128
I would choose Gene Autry

1561
01:22:25,664 --> 01:22:30,272
Feel so good

1562
01:22:30,784 --> 01:22:34,880
Really opening

1563
01:22:35,136 --> 01:22:40,512
Excited

1564
01:22:40,768 --> 01:22:45,120
Near them and at work on the phone situation

1565
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:47,680
Yourself why is

1566
01:22:48,192 --> 01:22:49,728
Rodger even on the show

1567
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:52,800
He can't talk about his personal stuff

1568
01:22:53,312 --> 01:22:54,336
He doesn't really

1569
01:22:54,592 --> 01:23:00,736
It's weird situation you have a gag order Alex even makes clear that like

1570
01:23:00,992 --> 01:23:02,528
We know you can't talk about that business

1571
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:05,600
It's always wondering what are they going to do

1572
01:23:05,856 --> 01:23:06,624
I thought one of Alex

1573
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:07,904
Subtle digs

1574
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:09,440
Thank you for contacts

1575
01:23:22,496 --> 01:23:24,800
President

1576
01:23:25,056 --> 01:23:28,640
Show that no one in the mainstream media will go back in

1577
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:40,928
Infowars today

1578
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:42,464
And set the record straight

1579
01:23:42,976 --> 01:23:46,816
About John testified

1580
01:23:47,072 --> 01:23:48,096
Yeah we're talking

1581
01:23:48,608 --> 01:23:52,448
That's what we're doing we're talking to Nixon

1582
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:54,752
About John

1583
01:23:55,008 --> 01:23:56,800
His rundown of the

1584
01:23:57,056 --> 01:23:57,568
The candidates

1585
01:23:57,824 --> 01:24:00,128
In 2020 of course

1586
01:24:00,384 --> 01:24:06,272
It's a pointless interview most hearts

1587
01:24:06,784 --> 01:24:08,320
The only thing that were interested is

1588
01:24:08,576 --> 01:24:10,112
You going to prison

1589
01:24:10,368 --> 01:24:11,136
You can't talk about

1590
01:24:13,184 --> 01:24:14,208
Is make a poop show

1591
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:15,232
Malik

1592
01:24:15,744 --> 01:24:17,024
Loves it

1593
01:24:38,784 --> 01:24:41,088
Their chemistry has not skipped a beat

1594
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:42,880
What is electric

1595
01:24:43,136 --> 01:24:44,160
Wolf

1596
01:24:46,464 --> 01:24:49,536
Oh man Alex is not good

1597
01:24:49,792 --> 01:24:50,560
No

1598
01:24:51,072 --> 01:24:51,584
Second

1599
01:24:52,096 --> 01:24:55,936
If that joker is really the one that hits the sweet spot for you

1600
01:24:56,192 --> 01:25:02,336
We got a long way to go it's also really funny because on our last episode Alex was talking about

1601
01:25:02,592 --> 01:25:07,200
Losing his shift for a poop joke

1602
01:25:09,504 --> 01:25:10,016
Crazy

1603
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:12,320
Oh boy told you there's a psychodrama

1604
01:25:12,576 --> 01:25:13,088
Going on

1605
01:25:13,344 --> 01:25:15,392
And I think it really starts to manifest

1606
01:25:15,648 --> 01:25:16,160
In this next

1607
01:25:16,416 --> 01:25:17,184
What we're Alex

1608
01:25:17,952 --> 01:25:18,464
It's kind of like

1609
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:19,744
Hey man

1610
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:20,512
You called me

1611
01:25:34,848 --> 01:25:40,992
Flash

1612
01:25:41,248 --> 01:25:42,016
Messages

1613
01:25:52,512 --> 01:25:56,608
You look freaking

1614
01:25:56,864 --> 01:25:58,144
You're looking pretty good

1615
01:25:58,656 --> 01:26:00,960
Give him an opportunity to answer

1616
01:26:02,496 --> 01:26:04,288
Yeah it does sound like that

1617
01:26:05,824 --> 01:26:08,384
Why didn't you talk to me that sounded really

1618
01:26:08,896 --> 01:26:12,992
And that's because you answer than Alex was like

1619
01:26:17,088 --> 01:26:22,208
To give at least a diplomatic

1620
01:26:22,464 --> 01:26:24,256
Space

1621
01:26:24,512 --> 01:26:26,816
To break my gag order if we talked more

1622
01:26:27,072 --> 01:26:28,096
We have an energy

1623
01:26:28,352 --> 01:26:28,864
Between us

1624
01:26:29,376 --> 01:26:35,520
You antagonize me I antagonize do we just kind of b*******

1625
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:42,176
Negative influence

1626
01:26:44,224 --> 01:26:48,064
Conversation probably is what

1627
01:26:49,088 --> 01:26:50,112
But also it's interesting

1628
01:26:50,368 --> 01:26:51,392
To know that

1629
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:52,672
Not talk

1630
01:26:52,928 --> 01:26:53,440
Alex

1631
01:26:53,696 --> 01:26:59,840
Is really hurts it really hurts but also he thinks of Rodger looks great

1632
01:27:00,096 --> 01:27:01,120
Pretty good

1633
01:27:01,632 --> 01:27:03,936
Looks like it's a little bit spinnerbaits

1634
01:27:04,192 --> 01:27:04,704
T-shirt

1635
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:05,984
I'm not sure

1636
01:27:07,008 --> 01:27:07,520
Won't stop.

1637
01:27:07,776 --> 01:27:08,288
Talking about how good you are

1638
01:27:09,312 --> 01:27:09,824
Rodger

1639
01:27:19,552 --> 01:27:25,696
Infowars

1640
01:27:41,312 --> 01:27:47,200
What a pro

1641
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:54,368
Keeble to get his plug-in so in order to do that plugs

1642
01:27:54,624 --> 01:28:00,000
Transition to a compliment into the plug that needs to make to make his own plug

1643
01:28:00,256 --> 01:28:06,400
Third stage now so good

1644
01:28:07,168 --> 01:28:07,680
Cheese's

1645
01:28:07,936 --> 01:28:11,008
So I confronted him about the wire

1646
01:28:11,264 --> 01:28:11,776
You texted me

1647
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:15,872
I don't think Alex was satisfied

1648
01:28:16,128 --> 01:28:18,432
With the answer that started

1649
01:28:18,944 --> 01:28:20,736
Interruption I think that he still wants

1650
01:28:20,992 --> 01:28:21,504
Trying

1651
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:22,272
Guilt

1652
01:28:22,528 --> 01:28:27,392
Rodger about his

1653
01:28:27,904 --> 01:28:29,952
Make it all about himself

1654
01:28:30,208 --> 01:28:31,232
So what he does

1655
01:28:31,488 --> 01:28:32,768
Is bringing Owen

1656
01:28:33,024 --> 01:28:37,376
Shroyer to try and help kill Rodger

1657
01:28:37,888 --> 01:28:40,704
Could you please tell Rodger that I am not

1658
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:45,824
Rodger look at our son

1659
01:28:46,592 --> 01:28:52,736
You have to talk to me I know you're just saying that I haven't you talked to Arboles

1660
01:28:52,992 --> 01:28:54,016
Call room together

1661
01:28:54,272 --> 01:28:56,576
This is the level of like

1662
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:57,856
Just Petty

1663
01:28:58,112 --> 01:28:59,648
Drama

1664
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:01,696
Shroyer Inn

1665
01:29:06,304 --> 01:29:07,840
Rodger call me back

1666
01:29:08,352 --> 01:29:10,656
How do I get him back

1667
01:29:10,912 --> 01:29:12,448
So come on over here

1668
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:16,032
Let me grab that Mike's Runner need the table there I just decided to do this

1669
01:29:18,336 --> 01:29:22,176
Why won't you call him back

1670
01:29:22,432 --> 01:29:28,576
Hey buddy is right here you got a weird beard with no mustache now that's what happens when he doesn't have a father figure

1671
01:29:30,112 --> 01:29:33,440
Look at beardies Cross months later

1672
01:29:33,696 --> 01:29:34,720
Little Owen Shroyer

1673
01:29:36,512 --> 01:29:37,792
He really misses you man

1674
01:29:38,048 --> 01:29:39,072
Jesus imagine

1675
01:29:40,096 --> 01:29:40,608
Feeling

1676
01:29:40,864 --> 01:29:41,888
Jilted by Rodger

1677
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:45,728
Emotionally imagine not knowing

1678
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:47,264
The outcome

1679
01:29:49,824 --> 01:29:55,968
Did you even bother

1680
01:29:56,224 --> 01:30:01,088
Oh by the way at the end of every relationship rogerstone is ever had

1681
01:30:01,344 --> 01:30:05,952
He's f***** off and told you to go to hell unless you have blackmail

1682
01:30:06,464 --> 01:30:10,304
It was next clip before

1683
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:12,352
To have a little bit of a back-and-forth

1684
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:15,680
Do a little bit

1685
01:30:16,192 --> 01:30:19,520
About the house

1686
01:30:21,056 --> 01:30:21,824
Biscuits

1687
01:30:23,616 --> 01:30:27,712
Literally

1688
01:30:47,424 --> 01:30:51,264
Will talk more about this

1689
01:30:51,776 --> 01:30:54,080
Danaya tried to explain what the

1690
01:30:54,336 --> 01:30:56,384
It's probably cuz you don't care

1691
01:30:56,640 --> 01:30:57,408
You're working towards

1692
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:58,432
Predetermined

1693
01:30:58,688 --> 01:30:59,200
Conclusion

1694
01:30:59,456 --> 01:31:01,760
Goofing around like that makes it

1695
01:31:02,016 --> 01:31:03,040
Fully clear to me

1696
01:31:05,088 --> 01:31:05,600
There's a pause

1697
01:31:05,856 --> 01:31:06,368
Disability

1698
01:31:06,624 --> 01:31:10,976
Even though and has Ebola

1699
01:31:11,232 --> 01:31:13,792
All bulshit

1700
01:31:14,048 --> 01:31:15,072
Display makes it so clear

1701
01:31:18,912 --> 01:31:19,936
Ebola

1702
01:31:20,192 --> 01:31:20,960
In some cases.

1703
01:31:21,216 --> 01:31:24,032
The surviving human testicles for periods of body care

1704
01:31:24,544 --> 01:31:26,592
29 survivors of the

1705
01:31:26,848 --> 01:31:30,688
The 2016 Ebola outbreak

1706
01:31:30,944 --> 01:31:33,248
Had some about a fragmented Ebola in there

1707
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:35,808
With 63% of that 9%

1708
01:31:36,064 --> 01:31:38,112
Still showing signs of it

1709
01:31:38,368 --> 01:31:38,880
They survived

1710
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:42,208
This is why the World Health Organization

1711
01:31:42,464 --> 01:31:44,000
Has specific guidelines

1712
01:31:44,256 --> 01:31:46,816
The place for sexual activity for people who survive

1713
01:31:47,328 --> 01:31:48,864
How did more research

1714
01:31:49,376 --> 01:31:50,144
Be done on the subject

1715
01:31:50,656 --> 01:31:51,936
Survivor seamanship

1716
01:31:52,192 --> 01:31:52,704
Should be tested every

1717
01:31:53,728 --> 01:31:54,496
And until they have

1718
01:31:54,752 --> 01:31:56,544
Justin Theroux the comeback

1719
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:58,336
Refrain from intercourse or used condom

1720
01:31:59,104 --> 01:32:01,664
This takes care of any concerns about possible transmission

1721
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:05,248
It may calm my or may not even be possible

1722
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:10,624
Ebola and the guys were like hey

1723
01:32:11,392 --> 01:32:12,416
Knock it off for about a year

1724
01:32:15,744 --> 01:32:17,024
That's a little simplistic but yeah

1725
01:32:20,096 --> 01:32:21,888
Survivors of Ebola

1726
01:32:22,144 --> 01:32:23,680
Because Ebola deaths

1727
01:32:23,936 --> 01:32:24,704
Hideout in the

1728
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:25,728
Testicles

1729
01:32:25,984 --> 01:32:28,288
Inspect a person for up to a year that's not

1730
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:32,896
If you have Ebola in your nuts right now you're going to have Ebola in a week

1731
01:32:34,432 --> 01:32:35,712
Misrepresented

1732
01:32:35,968 --> 01:32:37,248
Information in order to reinforce

1733
01:32:37,504 --> 01:32:38,784
Is completely incorrect a surge

1734
01:32:39,296 --> 01:32:42,368
That these people in San Antonio

1735
01:32:42,624 --> 01:32:45,440
You don't know what you don't see it it's in the balls

1736
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:49,536
Instead of presents

1737
01:32:50,048 --> 01:32:51,584
It's that it's not just like hey

1738
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:53,376
That's not even just

1739
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:54,912
No

1740
01:32:55,168 --> 01:32:55,936
A virus

1741
01:32:56,960 --> 01:33:01,056
I got to do a little bit of homophobic

1742
01:33:01,568 --> 01:33:02,848
Goofing around

1743
01:33:03,104 --> 01:33:05,152
Yeah yeah

1744
01:33:05,408 --> 01:33:06,688
Pretty stoked

1745
01:33:07,456 --> 01:33:09,760
Advocating

1746
01:33:11,296 --> 01:33:12,576
Murderers at the border

1747
01:33:12,832 --> 01:33:13,856
To kill these people

1748
01:33:14,368 --> 01:33:14,880
And then

1749
01:33:15,392 --> 01:33:17,696
Turn that into a homophobic thing as well

1750
01:33:18,208 --> 01:33:21,536
That's really a box right there

1751
01:33:21,792 --> 01:33:22,816
Spurt at the pivot

1752
01:33:27,168 --> 01:33:27,936
Yeah yeah

1753
01:33:28,448 --> 01:33:29,984
So there's something going on

1754
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:31,008
On the show

1755
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:32,288
Amy Rogers

1756
01:33:32,544 --> 01:33:34,080
They're having a real

1757
01:33:35,104 --> 01:33:36,384
Lost friendship moment

1758
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:37,408
On air

1759
01:33:37,664 --> 01:33:38,432
But also

1760
01:33:38,944 --> 01:33:39,456
Matt Drudge

1761
01:33:40,224 --> 01:33:42,528
Picked up that Rodger stone is on it

1762
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:43,552
Chinese pop

1763
01:33:43,808 --> 01:33:44,320
Link

1764
01:33:44,576 --> 01:33:45,088
He top LinkedIn

1765
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:48,416
Alex is super excited about the fact

1766
01:33:57,632 --> 01:34:02,240
Infowars.com source.com

1767
01:34:02,496 --> 01:34:08,640
Newport.com

1768
01:34:08,896 --> 01:34:13,504
Website the world not just the biggest news site is

1769
01:34:14,016 --> 01:34:15,040
In the world

1770
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:22,976
Shot in the world

1771
01:34:26,816 --> 01:34:29,120
There it is live Rodger Stone breaks silence

1772
01:34:30,656 --> 01:34:31,168
Keep Springs

1773
01:34:32,448 --> 01:34:35,264
I think the interview was supposed to be a bit shorter

1774
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:36,032
But he keeps

1775
01:34:36,288 --> 01:34:40,896
Stretching it out because he knows that we're top 10 that much traffic

1776
01:34:41,152 --> 01:34:42,432
Bratz

1777
01:34:42,688 --> 01:34:46,784
We also staying with garages the top news in the world in the number to website total but

1778
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:48,832
He doesn't say you can look it up

1779
01:34:49,088 --> 01:34:50,112
So I just don't

1780
01:34:50,368 --> 01:34:51,136
I know

1781
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:57,280
Currently the number one website in the world is Google

1782
01:34:57,792 --> 01:34:58,560
Number two

1783
01:34:58,816 --> 01:34:59,584
Number three is Facebook

1784
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:04,192
Wikipedia is number 5 Amazon, or bunch of

1785
01:35:05,472 --> 01:35:09,824
Chinese website like Baidu and secu.com

1786
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:10,592
Top 50

1787
01:35:11,104 --> 01:35:12,384
Drudge's

1788
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:14,432
50 sites if you only consider the United

1789
01:35:15,712 --> 01:35:21,856
You can make an argument that YouTube is in Subway's news related but there's also a lot more than just

1790
01:35:22,112 --> 01:35:22,880
You don't want to count

1791
01:35:23,136 --> 01:35:23,904
The top news site

1792
01:35:24,928 --> 01:35:26,720
Send a real tough time figuring out what

1793
01:35:26,976 --> 01:35:29,280
Constituted a news site so I can check Alex's

1794
01:35:29,536 --> 01:35:33,120
The top news

1795
01:35:33,632 --> 01:35:37,216
Alexa allows you to filter their results

1796
01:35:37,472 --> 01:35:38,496
And when you do that

1797
01:35:38,752 --> 01:35:40,032
You only include new sites

1798
01:35:40,544 --> 01:35:41,056
Guess what

1799
01:35:41,312 --> 01:35:44,896
Number 22 not number one

1800
01:35:45,152 --> 01:35:46,688
He comes in behind Reuters

1801
01:35:46,944 --> 01:35:51,296
Bloomberg znbc USA Today Forbes Washington Post Fox News

1802
01:35:51,552 --> 01:35:54,368
Yahoo news the guardian New York Times AMC

1803
01:35:57,184 --> 01:35:57,696
From Shutterstock

1804
01:36:01,792 --> 01:36:05,632
Still considered rudge the number one news source

1805
01:36:05,888 --> 01:36:07,936
Right

1806
01:36:08,192 --> 01:36:08,960
No he's not

1807
01:36:09,216 --> 01:36:15,360
Website

1808
01:36:15,872 --> 01:36:16,384
It's number

1809
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:17,664
In the news

1810
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:18,432
Category

1811
01:36:18,688 --> 01:36:22,016
Alexa Davis subcategory of news which is

1812
01:36:22,272 --> 01:36:22,784
Headlines

1813
01:36:23,552 --> 01:36:25,088
Which perfectly describes Drudge

1814
01:36:25,344 --> 01:36:26,624
He isn't even number one

1815
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:29,696
Headlines

1816
01:36:31,232 --> 01:36:31,744
Check the garage

1817
01:36:32,256 --> 01:36:36,352
According to 132nd biggest website in the world

1818
01:36:37,632 --> 01:36:38,912
60 second biggest in the United

1819
01:36:39,168 --> 01:36:40,448
State which is very impressive

1820
01:36:40,704 --> 01:36:41,984
He is nothing to be ashamed of

1821
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:45,824
But it really does disappointing

1822
01:36:46,336 --> 01:36:48,640
If you previously thought it was number 1 or 2

1823
01:36:50,944 --> 01:36:51,712
Expecting like

1824
01:36:51,968 --> 01:36:54,016
He was embellishing B

1825
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:55,808
Lottery Post

1826
01:36:56,064 --> 01:37:00,672
No might want to spend it and say that Alexa is a company that's run by Amazon

1827
01:37:01,952 --> 01:37:02,464
So fine

1828
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:04,256
I decided to check

1829
01:37:04,768 --> 01:37:05,792
Slightly different

1830
01:37:06,048 --> 01:37:07,584
Metrics than Alexa and they don't

1831
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:09,120
Include a wide range

1832
01:37:11,168 --> 01:37:12,960
So this number is a little bit different

1833
01:37:13,472 --> 01:37:15,520
Number 41

1834
01:37:17,824 --> 01:37:18,336
How to claim

1835
01:37:18,592 --> 01:37:20,640
Also they're not number one news site

1836
01:37:21,664 --> 01:37:23,712
BuzzFeed

1837
01:37:23,968 --> 01:37:24,736
He'll are all

1838
01:37:25,248 --> 01:37:26,272
Far above drugs

1839
01:37:26,784 --> 01:37:28,576
Mypoints

1840
01:37:28,832 --> 01:37:30,112
Shut up

1841
01:37:30,368 --> 01:37:31,136
Because

1842
01:37:31,392 --> 01:37:33,184
Drudge is the biggest website

1843
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:33,952
The world

1844
01:37:34,208 --> 01:37:35,232
George was founded in 90

1845
01:37:35,488 --> 01:37:36,768
T95

1846
01:37:37,024 --> 01:37:37,792
Who is launching his career

1847
01:37:38,048 --> 01:37:39,072
So the whole time

1848
01:37:39,328 --> 01:37:39,840
Has been peddling

1849
01:37:40,096 --> 01:37:41,888
Has been right there

1850
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:43,424
How to identify

1851
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:47,008
He's the most important biggest thing in the world

1852
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:51,360
Exaggerating drudges place in the world is one part hero-worship

1853
01:37:51,616 --> 01:37:54,176
But one part pathetic narcissism by proxy

1854
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:55,968
Ezekiel's

1855
01:37:56,224 --> 01:37:58,528
The two of their careers are like super intertwined it

1856
01:37:58,784 --> 01:38:00,064
Maybe there is something to that

1857
01:38:00,576 --> 01:38:01,344
There's probably

1858
01:38:01,856 --> 01:38:02,880
Probably a piece of it

1859
01:38:03,392 --> 01:38:05,696
Yeah I mean it also benefits him

1860
01:38:05,952 --> 01:38:07,232
Specifically to

1861
01:38:09,792 --> 01:38:12,608
Because the only time we talked about drudgereport really is whatever he

1862
01:38:12,864 --> 01:38:13,376
Audit

1863
01:38:14,912 --> 01:38:17,984
I just don't I don't play it

1864
01:38:18,496 --> 01:38:20,544
The number one or number two

1865
01:38:21,056 --> 01:38:23,616
Okay

1866
01:38:23,872 --> 01:38:24,640
Conservative Folk

1867
01:38:24,896 --> 01:38:26,944
He's what

1868
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:28,736
Turn the fire

1869
01:38:28,992 --> 01:38:30,528
Brings up headlines

1870
01:38:30,784 --> 01:38:32,832
From Dr gelot he's just covering a story

1871
01:38:36,416 --> 01:38:37,952
He brings it up outside of his

1872
01:38:38,208 --> 01:38:40,512
Is personal connection

1873
01:38:40,768 --> 01:38:45,888
But he also brings out the first I thought it was almost like

1874
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:46,912
Advertise

1875
01:38:47,168 --> 01:38:50,752
Alex

1876
01:38:51,008 --> 01:38:51,520
When he's on

1877
01:38:51,776 --> 01:38:53,312
That's

1878
01:38:53,568 --> 01:38:59,456
You know that kind of look at how great I am because of how great this is

1879
01:38:59,712 --> 01:39:03,040
And I'm on the number I'm the number one

1880
01:39:03,296 --> 01:39:06,624
Result Autumn number one in the world

1881
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:08,928
Yeah I definitely believe that that's fair

1882
01:39:09,184 --> 01:39:09,952
Yeah

1883
01:39:10,464 --> 01:39:11,488
So Rogers on

1884
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,304
Drudge's doing the advertising forum

1885
01:39:15,072 --> 01:39:15,840
Everything is great

1886
01:39:21,472 --> 01:39:24,544
Some polls

1887
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:25,312
I think this is going to last

1888
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:26,848
Because he believes

1889
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:29,664
But there's a mystery candidate

1890
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:48,352
I need a real people this is not

1891
01:39:55,008 --> 01:39:56,288
With Hillary and

1892
01:39:56,544 --> 01:40:00,640
Michelle talking about

1893
01:40:01,408 --> 01:40:03,200
Alex is an improv guy

1894
01:40:03,968 --> 01:40:09,856
Rodgers throws that curveball

1895
01:40:10,112 --> 01:40:12,160
Yeah that's

1896
01:40:12,416 --> 01:40:16,000
Braunig Lake

1897
01:40:16,256 --> 01:40:20,352
Where is that reporting earlier

1898
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:21,888
Like where is it

1899
01:40:22,144 --> 01:40:23,680
You never mentioned it before

1900
01:40:23,936 --> 01:40:26,240
Needed Rodger to bring it up to ever question

1901
01:40:26,496 --> 01:40:28,032
Never ever mentioned

1902
01:40:31,104 --> 01:40:32,896
Alex Express

1903
01:40:34,176 --> 01:40:34,688
Qanon

1904
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:35,712
Is electric

1905
01:40:36,224 --> 01:40:36,736
Psyop

1906
01:40:36,992 --> 01:40:37,760
Design

1907
01:40:38,016 --> 01:40:38,784
To try and

1908
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:39,808
Fracture the connection

1909
01:40:41,344 --> 01:40:42,368
And Donald Trump

1910
01:40:43,392 --> 01:40:45,952
Trump doesn't like

1911
01:40:46,720 --> 01:40:47,232
Rodger

1912
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,560
Coronavirus

1913
01:40:52,096 --> 01:40:52,864
And against you

1914
01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:58,240
Do you hate Rodger now

1915
01:40:58,496 --> 01:41:00,544
You guys are falling out your big enemies now

1916
01:41:07,968 --> 01:41:10,784
Chewing on movement

1917
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:23,584
This is

1918
01:41:26,912 --> 01:41:27,936
Sending out my

1919
01:41:34,336 --> 01:41:36,384
Disgusting

1920
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:38,944
Really I take me to learn to

1921
01:41:41,248 --> 01:41:42,784
See-through of that those sorts

1922
01:41:43,296 --> 01:41:44,320
Things like you

1923
01:41:44,576 --> 01:41:45,856
Like a wild child

1924
01:41:47,904 --> 01:41:49,440
I don't think the logic

1925
01:41:49,696 --> 01:41:50,208
Conclusion

1926
01:41:50,464 --> 01:41:51,744
To come to is this

1927
01:41:54,816 --> 01:41:56,608
That's the other kind of bad thinking

1928
01:41:56,864 --> 01:42:03,008
You came to the right conclusion people

1929
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:05,056
Is the dumbest possible Road

1930
01:42:05,312 --> 01:42:11,456
And you're a s*** advocate

1931
01:42:11,712 --> 01:42:13,504
Reach the right conclusion because you found a way

1932
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:15,296
To make it work for you

1933
01:42:17,856 --> 01:42:23,744
Your main goal is to only obfuscate the same way just have people come to you you know

1934
01:42:24,256 --> 01:42:25,024
For sure

1935
01:42:25,536 --> 01:42:27,584
So we learned Twitter

1936
01:42:28,352 --> 01:42:29,120
You know I mean

1937
01:42:29,632 --> 01:42:31,168
The biggest websites in the world

1938
01:42:32,192 --> 01:42:32,704
Love it

1939
01:42:34,752 --> 01:42:36,288
But it turns out it's days are numbered

1940
01:42:42,688 --> 01:42:44,224
Before you said I'm looking at it

1941
01:42:47,296 --> 01:42:49,344
Probably probably

1942
01:42:49,856 --> 01:42:51,904
He's a counter-puncher

1943
01:43:06,496 --> 01:43:08,544
The idea that Trump has a

1944
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:09,312
Conservative

1945
01:43:09,568 --> 01:43:10,848
Twitter ready to go

1946
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:13,408
I don't know what level

1947
01:43:13,664 --> 01:43:14,176
Of

1948
01:43:14,688 --> 01:43:15,200
Whack

1949
01:43:15,456 --> 01:43:15,968
You've got to be

1950
01:43:16,224 --> 01:43:16,736
To pick the facts

1951
01:43:16,992 --> 01:43:20,320
Going on the president using the powers of

1952
01:43:20,832 --> 01:43:21,344
The presidency

1953
01:43:23,648 --> 01:43:25,184
Has just been like okay

1954
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:26,464
Weave designs

1955
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:29,792
Conservative Twitter

1956
01:43:30,048 --> 01:43:31,840
We're just waiting for the right time

1957
01:43:32,096 --> 01:43:33,120
Which I assume is

1958
01:43:33,376 --> 01:43:36,448
Very shortly after Mike Adams the health Ranger is kickoff

1959
01:43:39,008 --> 01:43:40,800
Sprite you know what then going

1960
01:43:41,056 --> 01:43:41,568
It already

1961
01:43:41,824 --> 01:43:44,128
Call Jack

1962
01:43:44,384 --> 01:43:45,152
Just yeah

1963
01:43:45,408 --> 01:43:48,736
He's already over there probably right

1964
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:51,296
It takes a lot to get

1965
01:43:53,088 --> 01:43:54,624
Is it is weird

1966
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:55,648
How

1967
01:43:56,160 --> 01:43:56,672
Impotent

1968
01:43:56,928 --> 01:43:57,696
Trump is showing him

1969
01:43:57,952 --> 01:43:58,464
Himself.

1970
01:43:59,488 --> 01:44:00,256
Even as he

1971
01:44:00,512 --> 01:44:01,024
Exercising

1972
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:03,584
Ridiculously

1973
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:04,352
Powerful pain

1974
01:44:05,888 --> 01:44:07,424
Like so much of him

1975
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:08,192
Saying stuff

1976
01:44:08,448 --> 01:44:08,960
Is just

1977
01:44:09,472 --> 01:44:11,008
He says he's going to do something

1978
01:44:11,264 --> 01:44:15,360
The news covers at people get all excited or all angry about it

1979
01:44:15,616 --> 01:44:17,152
And then it turns out later that he

1980
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:24,064
Nobody cares because it's 5 days later

1981
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:26,368
It's clearly to preserve this base

1982
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:28,416
It Feels jilted by social media

1983
01:44:28,672 --> 01:44:29,696
Companies

1984
01:44:31,232 --> 01:44:32,256
Strategic element to

1985
01:44:34,048 --> 01:44:35,328
Assertive

1986
01:44:35,584 --> 01:44:39,680
Do that

1987
01:44:39,936 --> 01:44:43,008
We got that settled I'm sure

1988
01:44:44,288 --> 01:44:45,056
So

1989
01:44:45,312 --> 01:44:47,616
It does next clip Alex gets back to his personal

1990
01:44:47,872 --> 01:44:48,384
Feelings

1991
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:49,408
About Rodger

1992
01:44:50,432 --> 01:44:51,712
Did you try just once again

1993
01:44:51,968 --> 01:44:53,504
To know why find out

1994
01:44:54,016 --> 01:44:54,528
You call me

1995
01:44:56,064 --> 01:44:56,576
From Rogers

1996
01:44:58,624 --> 01:44:59,904
He does not really care

1997
01:45:00,160 --> 01:45:01,184
Did Alex Fields reject

1998
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:08,864
Except maybe twice on the phone while 34 months

1999
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:45,728
Your Calculus

2000
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:52,384
Horse

2001
01:46:03,904 --> 01:46:05,952
I don't think Alex got what he needed out of that

2002
01:46:06,208 --> 01:46:06,720
Exchange

2003
01:46:09,024 --> 01:46:12,352
Really glad he's top links

2004
01:46:12,864 --> 01:46:14,656
This sort of breakdown

2005
01:46:19,264 --> 01:46:25,408
I mean also insurance

2006
01:46:26,944 --> 01:46:30,016
No in full knowledge that he's a prop

2007
01:46:30,784 --> 01:46:33,088
888

2008
01:46:33,856 --> 01:46:36,416
Even though it is so obvious and I'm

2009
01:46:36,672 --> 01:46:39,744
How stupid these people are

2010
01:46:41,024 --> 01:46:41,536
Trump

2011
01:46:42,816 --> 01:46:44,864
Why don't you return my calls anymore

2012
01:46:45,376 --> 01:46:45,888
Dude

2013
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:52,544
Don't have loyalty

2014
01:46:53,056 --> 01:46:54,592
How did you not already know that

2015
01:46:54,848 --> 01:46:57,664
I'm like gravel in the

2016
01:46:58,176 --> 01:47:00,992
I still feel sad for how stupid you are you don't

2017
01:47:01,248 --> 01:47:02,016
You don't feel it

2018
01:47:02,272 --> 01:47:02,784
Sympathy for the

2019
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:06,880
The people you feeling empathy for the situation

2020
01:47:07,392 --> 01:47:08,928
You know people who don't deserve

2021
01:47:09,184 --> 01:47:13,024
That sort of treatment

2022
01:47:17,632 --> 01:47:21,472
The care about Alex's her feelings is that the bridge too far

2023
01:47:21,984 --> 01:47:25,568
So we get back now to the idea about the CIA

2024
01:47:25,824 --> 01:47:28,384
Telling Alex that Michelle Obama Hillary Clinton

2025
01:47:29,408 --> 01:47:30,432
To discuss running for president

2026
01:47:30,688 --> 01:47:31,968
Hey guess what Rodger Stone

2027
01:47:43,232 --> 01:47:44,256
Can you comment on that

2028
01:48:03,456 --> 01:48:04,480
Dark Horse

2029
01:48:14,976 --> 01:48:16,768
Comes from nowhere

2030
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:27,264
I want to FedEx.

2031
01:48:57,216 --> 01:49:00,032
You are going to stay with us

2032
01:49:00,288 --> 01:49:01,312
I need you

2033
01:49:03,104 --> 01:49:06,688
Cuz you're all you're doing five more minutes

2034
01:49:06,944 --> 01:49:07,712
That was

2035
01:49:08,224 --> 01:49:14,368
That was a lot every single

2036
01:49:14,624 --> 01:49:20,768
I told you before

2037
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:27,680
Do you got in that clip you got Rodger rejecting Alex's

2038
01:49:27,936 --> 01:49:32,800
Nonsense

2039
01:49:33,056 --> 01:49:39,200
CIA told him something not true sources are shittin

2040
01:49:41,248 --> 01:49:42,272
Michelle doesn't suck

2041
01:49:42,528 --> 01:49:45,088
What are you talkin about

2042
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:46,368
Alex

2043
01:49:46,624 --> 01:49:48,416
Uses the term Dark Horse

2044
01:49:51,744 --> 01:49:55,328
It doesn't even sound like a dog whistle in anyway

2045
01:49:55,584 --> 01:49:56,864
Usable colloquial term

2046
01:49:58,144 --> 01:49:59,168
It's so

2047
01:49:59,680 --> 01:50:03,264
Self-conscious or whatever

2048
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:04,544
Brown

2049
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:09,152
It's very shows The Mentalist

2050
01:50:11,968 --> 01:50:15,040
Politically correct

2051
01:50:15,552 --> 01:50:17,600
So

2052
01:50:19,392 --> 01:50:20,928
Yeah yeah it seems like

2053
01:50:21,184 --> 01:50:25,024
He's afraid that his listeners are going to call in and be like you should have called her

2054
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:29,120
You know like

2055
01:50:30,400 --> 01:50:31,936
Merry Christmas

2056
01:50:32,192 --> 01:50:35,264
Visual think he's going out of his way

2057
01:50:36,544 --> 01:50:37,568
Responding to imagine

2058
01:50:37,824 --> 01:50:40,384
Criticism little gift from like Media Matters

2059
01:50:40,640 --> 01:50:44,224
Because Michelle Obama a dark horse

2060
01:50:44,480 --> 01:50:46,784
Cuz that would be Luke

2061
01:50:47,552 --> 01:50:50,624
But it is not okay that he's still doing

2062
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:51,392
She's a Man

2063
01:50:51,648 --> 01:50:54,208
Narrative

2064
01:50:57,792 --> 01:50:58,816
She's a Man

2065
01:51:00,096 --> 01:51:03,680
Spiraling

2066
01:51:03,936 --> 01:51:04,448
Weird

2067
01:51:04,704 --> 01:51:06,240
I think Alex has started drinking

2068
01:51:06,496 --> 01:51:12,384
By this point interaction with Rodger is not gone

2069
01:51:12,640 --> 01:51:16,736
For some sort of emotional recognition on Rogers part that he hit

2070
01:51:19,040 --> 01:51:24,672
You wouldn't call me I texted you and you said we didn't have to talk about your case

2071
01:51:24,928 --> 01:51:25,952
I thought we were friends

2072
01:51:26,208 --> 01:51:27,232
We've been in this Burg

2073
01:51:27,488 --> 01:51:28,256
Sears now

2074
01:51:28,512 --> 01:51:31,840
If you've been on my show everyday my main source of information

2075
01:51:32,096 --> 01:51:33,888
My brand for you

2076
01:51:34,656 --> 01:51:37,728
Basically

2077
01:51:37,984 --> 01:51:42,080
Threw me aside you needed something and I don't got it and I think

2078
01:51:43,616 --> 01:51:44,640
Cuz it starts to get

2079
01:51:44,896 --> 01:51:45,664
Real weird

2080
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:47,200
The end of the show is

2081
01:51:49,760 --> 01:51:50,272
It's

2082
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:52,064
He's clearly showing signs of

2083
01:51:52,320 --> 01:51:54,624
Being f***** up

2084
01:51:55,392 --> 01:51:57,440
Yeah

2085
01:51:57,696 --> 01:51:58,464
She gets back from break

2086
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:01,280
Can't Stop

2087
01:52:02,048 --> 01:52:08,192
Elizabeth short-segment drudgereport.com

2088
01:52:08,448 --> 01:52:14,592
Brokensilenze.com

2089
01:52:17,408 --> 01:52:19,200
100

2090
01:52:19,456 --> 01:52:23,296
Ebola from Congo

2091
01:52:23,552 --> 01:52:26,368
Assault

2092
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:28,672
He's really exaggerating a lot of what footage

2093
01:52:29,696 --> 01:52:32,256
He's getting some of that. Keep them over

2094
01:52:32,768 --> 01:52:36,608
Human Rodger wrap-up interviewing a fairly boring

2095
01:52:37,888 --> 01:52:38,400
Because

2096
01:52:39,168 --> 01:52:41,472
Nothing's going to stop what's already happened

2097
01:52:42,496 --> 01:52:43,776
Please just tell me

2098
01:52:44,032 --> 01:52:46,080
Do you love me

2099
01:52:46,336 --> 01:52:47,360
Degree to stay in touch

2100
01:52:48,896 --> 01:52:52,224
He'll be back on the show and Rodger plugs his stuff

2101
01:52:52,480 --> 01:52:53,760
It's all good

2102
01:52:54,016 --> 01:52:55,552
Alex

2103
01:52:57,856 --> 01:52:58,624
Ebola bulshit

2104
01:53:01,952 --> 01:53:03,744
Groups

2105
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:05,280
Millions are coming

2106
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:08,608
More

2107
01:53:14,496 --> 01:53:15,264
What diseases

2108
01:53:16,544 --> 01:53:18,848
Commander become creatures with Democrats

2109
01:53:19,616 --> 01:53:21,664
You hear the way he's like gasping almost

2110
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:22,688
Is that his

2111
01:53:22,944 --> 01:53:23,456
Is

2112
01:53:23,712 --> 01:53:25,248
Verbal pattern his shift

2113
01:53:26,016 --> 01:53:27,808
Intoxication

2114
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:30,624
Also he's literally

2115
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:34,464
I wouldn't be mad about these people but they're poor uneducated and disease

2116
01:53:34,976 --> 01:53:36,256
I think I think

2117
01:53:36,512 --> 01:53:38,560
You have no reason to believe that

2118
01:53:38,816 --> 01:53:42,144
No evidence of any that you don't know anything about these people

2119
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:43,424
You don't know what economics

2120
01:53:43,680 --> 01:53:48,544
Situation any of them know their educational background

2121
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:49,568
You're f****** bigotry

2122
01:53:50,080 --> 01:53:51,104
All you're doing

2123
01:53:51,872 --> 01:53:52,384
A white National

2124
01:53:52,640 --> 01:53:53,664
Yeah

2125
01:53:54,176 --> 01:53:57,248
We want we want the best immigrants

2126
01:54:02,624 --> 01:54:03,136
Reinforce

2127
01:54:03,392 --> 01:54:04,672
My theory is that Alex has started

2128
01:54:08,256 --> 01:54:08,768
StarTalk

2129
01:54:10,816 --> 01:54:12,096
Conspiracies about these immigrants

2130
01:54:13,120 --> 01:54:16,192
Interview with the two of them

2131
01:54:16,448 --> 01:54:18,496
F****** in sex

2132
01:54:19,008 --> 01:54:20,032
Distance

2133
01:54:20,544 --> 01:54:23,360
This is real clunky because one guy is

2134
01:54:23,616 --> 01:54:24,640
Clearly been drinking

2135
01:54:24,896 --> 01:54:25,664
And the other one has

2136
01:54:26,688 --> 01:54:27,200
EXO

2137
01:54:27,712 --> 01:54:30,272
Phones kind of trying to keep the ship moving forward

2138
01:54:30,528 --> 01:54:31,296
And Alex is just

2139
01:54:31,552 --> 01:54:32,064
All of it

2140
01:54:32,832 --> 01:54:38,976
Why do we have to take everybody

2141
01:54:39,232 --> 01:54:42,048
Got new clothes

2142
01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:50,496
After pouring under-educated now there's the Upper Crust

2143
01:54:53,312 --> 01:54:54,848
They are both bad because

2144
01:54:55,104 --> 01:54:58,688
Is Flo

2145
01:54:59,200 --> 01:55:03,808
Why do we have to take everybody

2146
01:55:04,064 --> 01:55:08,160
Smartphones

2147
01:55:13,536 --> 01:55:19,680
You can play

2148
01:55:21,472 --> 01:55:26,336
Humanitarian

2149
01:55:27,872 --> 01:55:34,016
Free stuff

2150
01:55:38,624 --> 01:55:40,416
Give us your money b****

2151
01:55:40,928 --> 01:55:41,696
That's amazing

2152
01:55:42,976 --> 01:55:46,560
The apologizing

2153
01:55:51,424 --> 01:55:56,032
Michelle I'm sorry Lord Jesus f****** Christ these people are coming over

2154
01:55:56,544 --> 01:55:59,104
Bile

2155
01:56:00,128 --> 01:56:03,200
Anchor baby scam the place with the

2156
01:56:03,456 --> 01:56:06,016
Completely lost

2157
01:56:06,272 --> 01:56:07,552
Whatever

2158
01:56:07,808 --> 01:56:09,344
It is

2159
01:56:11,392 --> 01:56:13,696
It's all of his narratives wrapped in one

2160
01:56:14,208 --> 01:56:16,768
It gets worse than this next clip because he takes it

2161
01:56:17,024 --> 01:56:19,072
He takes it to another place

2162
01:56:19,328 --> 01:56:20,096
But he has no reason to

2163
01:56:21,120 --> 01:56:23,936
Support.com

2164
01:56:24,192 --> 01:56:26,240
Haberdish and the videos

2165
01:56:33,664 --> 01:56:34,688
Not better

2166
01:56:34,944 --> 01:56:39,296
30%

2167
01:56:39,552 --> 01:56:45,696
Because it's

2168
01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:53,120
I don't like how much you saying baby quite frankly

2169
01:56:53,632 --> 01:56:56,192
It's up

2170
01:56:56,448 --> 01:57:02,592
Goddamn

2171
01:57:05,152 --> 01:57:06,944
I don't know what he they're not like us

2172
01:57:07,200 --> 01:57:09,760
Hi there Muslim I do not know what he's doing man

2173
01:57:10,272 --> 01:57:14,112
Like for this entire episode the attacks on the refugees from the Congo or pretty

2174
01:57:14,368 --> 01:57:19,488
Focus the first couple hours

2175
01:57:19,744 --> 01:57:20,512
10th episode

2176
01:57:20,768 --> 01:57:21,280
Who's the skull

2177
01:57:22,304 --> 01:57:28,192
Completely inaccurate based on over white nationalism pretty straight line of

2178
01:57:28,704 --> 01:57:30,752
Yeah Mel towards the end of the show

2179
01:57:31,008 --> 01:57:31,776
Drink

2180
01:57:35,104 --> 01:57:38,432
If I once knew anything about

2181
01:57:39,712 --> 01:57:41,248
Population is 90

2182
01:57:41,504 --> 01:57:42,016
6% crisp

2183
01:57:42,528 --> 01:57:45,088
Only about 1% of the country is Muslim which is

2184
01:57:45,344 --> 01:57:47,392
Not too much higher than the u.s. percentage

2185
01:57:49,184 --> 01:57:51,744
I really think Alex started drinking during the commercial break

2186
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:52,768
Rodger was on

2187
01:57:53,024 --> 01:57:57,120
Because he knew the garage was like to answer was drinking out of a Drudge

2188
01:57:58,912 --> 01:57:59,424
Call boy

2189
01:57:59,680 --> 01:58:00,192
A camera

2190
01:58:00,704 --> 01:58:01,984
And Owen seems pretty annoyed

2191
01:58:02,240 --> 01:58:03,776
Like if you're watching the video It Doesn't

2192
01:58:04,032 --> 01:58:05,056
He doesn't seem to be enjoying

2193
01:58:05,312 --> 01:58:06,592
Idea exchange Altima

2194
01:58:07,360 --> 01:58:09,152
Alex's Behavior has completely changed

2195
01:58:09,664 --> 01:58:10,432
It's today

2196
01:58:11,968 --> 01:58:13,248
He's trying to working all the

2197
01:58:13,504 --> 01:58:14,016
Four groups of hate

2198
01:58:14,272 --> 01:58:16,320
The build-up is conspiracy in Owensboro

2199
01:58:16,576 --> 01:58:18,880
Keep the ball moving forward cuz he's proud of whatever

2200
01:58:20,160 --> 01:58:20,928
Disgust

2201
01:58:21,184 --> 01:58:21,696
Open picture

2202
01:58:21,952 --> 01:58:22,464
It doesn't get better

2203
01:58:25,024 --> 01:58:28,608
Would like to know what because he's only on there for 3 hours

2204
01:58:32,704 --> 01:58:33,472
I would say

2205
01:58:33,728 --> 01:58:39,872
Longer than 3 hours to get to Muslim

2206
01:58:40,384 --> 01:58:40,896
Really low

2207
01:58:41,408 --> 01:58:42,432
Could be because of his

2208
01:58:43,456 --> 01:58:43,968
Lankybox

2209
01:58:44,480 --> 01:58:45,504
I don't know if that's

2210
01:58:45,760 --> 01:58:48,320
People respond to substance

2211
01:58:48,576 --> 01:58:49,344
Differently

2212
01:58:49,600 --> 01:58:52,672
He has a point where he

2213
01:58:53,184 --> 01:58:54,720
Drinks

2214
01:58:54,976 --> 01:58:55,488
Pretty quick

2215
01:58:56,768 --> 01:58:57,536
Keep maintain

2216
01:59:02,144 --> 01:59:03,424
Sometimes

2217
01:59:03,680 --> 01:59:04,704
Some don't do nose

2218
01:59:05,728 --> 01:59:08,800
Biology furious at

2219
01:59:09,056 --> 01:59:09,568
Anyone

2220
01:59:09,824 --> 01:59:12,896
Who says why are we have to be the one

2221
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:15,200
Sure I hate

2222
01:59:15,712 --> 01:59:17,504
I hate that so much because

2223
01:59:23,392 --> 01:59:27,232
There's a big is a big part of this Americana

2224
01:59:27,744 --> 01:59:28,256
You know

2225
01:59:28,512 --> 01:59:33,888
That's why we take them in because that's what originally Drew people to this stupid

2226
01:59:34,400 --> 01:59:40,544
We were so great

2227
01:59:40,800 --> 01:59:42,848
And now they see us for the white nationalist

2228
01:59:43,104 --> 01:59:44,128
Dumbasses that we are

2229
01:59:44,896 --> 01:59:46,176
And that's what's

2230
01:59:47,712 --> 01:59:48,480
Shroyer

2231
01:59:50,528 --> 01:59:52,064
He's one of the

2232
01:59:54,112 --> 01:59:54,624
He's a brave America

2233
01:59:54,880 --> 01:59:55,392
I don't think so

2234
01:59:56,160 --> 02:00:02,304
Just me Having the courage of going in there

2235
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:03,584
America right now

2236
02:00:03,840 --> 02:00:09,984
Humanitarian Aid

2237
02:00:10,240 --> 02:00:16,384
Giving out foreign country and white people are bad

2238
02:00:24,064 --> 02:00:25,344
Man he is going through some

2239
02:00:27,904 --> 02:00:29,696
About it being a brave America

2240
02:00:31,232 --> 02:00:35,072
To his question about why the US is if the u.s. is so bad

2241
02:00:35,328 --> 02:00:37,120
So much for it

2242
02:00:37,632 --> 02:00:38,912
But I'm not going to provide

2243
02:00:39,424 --> 02:00:43,776
More fun

2244
02:00:45,568 --> 02:00:46,592
Before Trump Campbell.

2245
02:00:47,104 --> 02:00:48,384
The only politician Alex

2246
02:00:48,640 --> 02:00:51,200
And Infowars completely supported was Ron Paul

2247
02:00:51,712 --> 02:00:53,760
He was a gold standard

2248
02:00:54,272 --> 02:00:56,320
Alex's operation was fully behind

2249
02:00:56,576 --> 02:00:57,088
For president

2250
02:00:57,344 --> 02:00:59,136
A 2008-2012

2251
02:00:59,648 --> 02:01:03,744
Alex love Ron Paul so much support it is wet noodle

2252
02:01:04,512 --> 02:01:09,632
What is Ron Paul's signature issues with his proposal to literally abolish all foreign aid

2253
02:01:09,888 --> 02:01:16,032
Opposition Alex Jones guest Webster Tarpley his amount to willing genocide Intuit

2254
02:01:17,056 --> 02:01:20,640
Even Figures were fairly conservative look on Ron Paul's approach to this issue

2255
02:01:20,896 --> 02:01:21,664
His Manifesto

2256
02:01:21,920 --> 02:01:23,456
Cruel and really f***** up

2257
02:01:23,968 --> 02:01:26,272
But this is Alex's favorite politician of all time

2258
02:01:26,528 --> 02:01:30,624
And I've never heard him say something like I love Ron Paul but I think he's a little out there on one

2259
02:01:30,880 --> 02:01:32,672
Stop sending emergency aid

2260
02:01:32,928 --> 02:01:33,440
Two places

2261
02:01:35,232 --> 02:01:38,304
Is that when you exist within a propaganda organization

2262
02:01:38,560 --> 02:01:40,608
Waterford

2263
02:01:40,864 --> 02:01:43,680
Who's dad said on eliminating

2264
02:01:44,192 --> 02:01:44,960
You don't get any points

2265
02:01:45,216 --> 02:01:48,288
From bringing up how great this country is her providing for it

2266
02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:50,080
Manifestly again

2267
02:01:50,848 --> 02:01:52,640
Is very slow

2268
02:01:53,152 --> 02:01:54,432
Operation exist

2269
02:01:54,688 --> 02:01:56,736
As an opportunistic Lee abusive machine

2270
02:01:57,504 --> 02:02:02,368
Infowars supported Ron Paul's desire to abolish for it because it would hurt other people

2271
02:02:02,624 --> 02:02:04,416
And presumably have more

2272
02:02:04,672 --> 02:02:06,720
Provide more money for quote unquote

2273
02:02:07,232 --> 02:02:10,816
Now they're perfectly happy to act like they support for 1/8

2274
02:02:11,072 --> 02:02:14,144
Said Aid as a weapon to shame immigrants and refugees

2275
02:02:15,936 --> 02:02:16,448
Understand

2276
02:02:16,704 --> 02:02:18,240
What appears on the surface

2277
02:02:18,496 --> 02:02:19,008
To be hypocritical

2278
02:02:19,520 --> 02:02:20,800
But if you understand what

2279
02:02:21,056 --> 02:02:22,592
What it was about their former position

2280
02:02:23,104 --> 02:02:24,640
And their actions

2281
02:02:25,152 --> 02:02:27,200
It becomes clear that what motivates both is

2282
02:02:28,480 --> 02:02:29,248
A hatred of

2283
02:02:29,504 --> 02:02:30,272
People unlike them

2284
02:02:32,576 --> 02:02:34,112
Yeah

2285
02:02:37,184 --> 02:02:38,208
At a certain point

2286
02:02:38,720 --> 02:02:44,864
Do you think they're going to go all the way around and be like hey we're going to start sending more foreign aid so

2287
02:02:45,120 --> 02:02:45,632
So you don't come

2288
02:02:46,400 --> 02:02:52,544
It'll be an interesting argument for them to try and make I don't ever could because it would probably

2289
02:02:52,800 --> 02:02:53,568
Probably involved like

2290
02:02:54,080 --> 02:02:54,592
Taxation

2291
02:02:57,152 --> 02:02:58,688
Interesting

2292
02:02:58,944 --> 02:03:00,992
Attempt on their part to make like a compromised

2293
02:03:01,248 --> 02:03:02,528
Between these weird beliefs

2294
02:03:03,040 --> 02:03:03,552
I don't know

2295
02:03:03,808 --> 02:03:05,088
I think that they value

2296
02:03:05,344 --> 02:03:05,856
Cruelty

2297
02:03:06,112 --> 02:03:06,624
Seymour

2298
02:03:06,880 --> 02:03:08,416
Hangouts I don't I don't think it would do that

2299
02:03:08,928 --> 02:03:12,000
Cuz it would be like decreased cruelty and increased tax

2300
02:03:12,512 --> 02:03:15,584
What is a non-starter

2301
02:03:24,544 --> 02:03:25,056
Tecumseh Inn

2302
02:03:25,312 --> 02:03:26,336
Another Kaitlin Bennett

2303
02:03:26,592 --> 02:03:29,408
The girl who is most famous for walking around

2304
02:03:29,664 --> 02:03:30,176
Kent State with a

2305
02:03:30,432 --> 02:03:33,760
Yeah she's great she is

2306
02:03:34,528 --> 02:03:35,040
Douche

2307
02:03:36,320 --> 02:03:37,344
Got involved

2308
02:03:38,368 --> 02:03:41,440
Point USA Charlie Kirk's organization

2309
02:03:41,696 --> 02:03:43,232
She's all over the place

2310
02:03:43,488 --> 02:03:46,048
I don't really have many feelings about her other than like

2311
02:03:46,816 --> 02:03:48,352
This is a f*****-up

2312
02:03:48,864 --> 02:03:49,632
On the show

2313
02:03:49,888 --> 02:03:50,400
Pikachu

2314
02:03:50,656 --> 02:03:52,704
She starts talking about an interaction that she had

2315
02:03:53,728 --> 02:03:55,008
Infowars

2316
02:03:55,264 --> 02:04:01,408
And what you clearly describing as someone who's willing to talk to her until they realized who she was

2317
02:04:05,504 --> 02:04:06,016
See this kind of

2318
02:04:06,528 --> 02:04:07,040
My God

2319
02:04:07,552 --> 02:04:08,320
Disorder lack of awareness

2320
02:04:09,344 --> 02:04:10,112
Probably

2321
02:04:22,912 --> 02:04:24,704
Flaky realize

2322
02:04:25,984 --> 02:04:29,056
Pirates remember is working now

2323
02:04:29,568 --> 02:04:32,384
I don't like her so she he went and got his dad

2324
02:04:32,640 --> 02:04:37,760
His dad and himself.

2325
02:04:45,952 --> 02:04:52,096
Democrats that are out there

2326
02:04:53,376 --> 02:04:56,448
It happens all the time to me if you were minority

2327
02:04:56,704 --> 02:04:59,008
Every time I go out

2328
02:04:59,520 --> 02:05:01,568
Well the only thing

2329
02:05:01,824 --> 02:05:04,384
The same every time he's you

2330
02:05:04,896 --> 02:05:06,176
So is the

2331
02:05:06,688 --> 02:05:08,224
Used to be happening every time

2332
02:05:08,480 --> 02:05:12,576
You go out you got to realize the only variable that is the same

2333
02:05:13,600 --> 02:05:14,624
Is what you bring

2334
02:05:16,160 --> 02:05:16,672
She doesn't either

2335
02:05:18,976 --> 02:05:20,768
I believe all Democrats are programs

2336
02:05:21,024 --> 02:05:22,048
2 attack

2337
02:05:22,304 --> 02:05:24,864
I think she's is specifically trying to say that

2338
02:05:25,120 --> 02:05:25,632
It's all women

2339
02:05:25,888 --> 02:05:32,032
As well if she's receiving a bunch of and I'm sure she is receiving a bunch of

2340
02:05:33,312 --> 02:05:34,080
Backpacks

2341
02:05:34,336 --> 02:05:36,128
From the quote-unquote

2342
02:05:43,040 --> 02:05:45,344
In the videos that she put out I don't know why I did

2343
02:05:45,856 --> 02:05:49,696
Myself but I did watch a bunch of them and I don't see that being represented

2344
02:05:50,976 --> 02:05:52,256
The problem does exist on

2345
02:05:54,560 --> 02:06:00,704
And it's wrong I'm totally wrong.

2346
02:06:00,960 --> 02:06:06,080
Like you are

2347
02:06:06,336 --> 02:06:12,480
Definitely

2348
02:06:12,736 --> 02:06:15,296
Poking

2349
02:06:15,552 --> 02:06:17,856
I don't know baby I know who she is maybe I don't

2350
02:06:18,112 --> 02:06:18,880
I don't want to talk

2351
02:06:19,136 --> 02:06:19,648
You anymore

2352
02:06:19,904 --> 02:06:22,208
That's not your programming

2353
02:06:22,720 --> 02:06:24,512
Realizing the conversation you're in

2354
02:06:24,768 --> 02:06:26,304
Is with someone who has bad faith

2355
02:06:26,560 --> 02:06:28,352
How is this

2356
02:06:28,608 --> 02:06:30,656
How old was the

2357
02:06:31,680 --> 02:06:37,056
Mid-twenties

2358
02:06:40,128 --> 02:06:40,640
Yeah

2359
02:06:42,944 --> 02:06:43,968
Videos here in a second

2360
02:06:44,224 --> 02:06:45,248
Because like I said I did watch

2361
02:06:45,504 --> 02:06:46,016
Watch a bunch of

2362
02:06:46,784 --> 02:06:47,296
They're dogshit

2363
02:06:47,808 --> 02:06:50,368
But Alex is really on this thing

2364
02:06:50,880 --> 02:06:51,904
I spend a milli

2365
02:06:52,160 --> 02:06:53,184
Caitlin out there

2366
02:06:55,232 --> 02:06:56,768
All these dudes

2367
02:06:59,840 --> 02:07:02,656
I can't believe these people aren't chivalrous

2368
02:07:03,168 --> 02:07:04,704
Am I

2369
02:07:05,216 --> 02:07:11,360
In the middle of decry

2370
02:07:17,248 --> 02:07:18,272
Imma keep doing it

2371
02:07:18,784 --> 02:07:19,808
This is right thing

2372
02:07:20,320 --> 02:07:23,904
Pinterest

2373
02:07:24,672 --> 02:07:29,792
I'm literally

2374
02:07:34,144 --> 02:07:35,168
Armed man

2375
02:07:42,336 --> 02:07:44,128
Blackwater peopleready

2376
02:07:44,640 --> 02:07:45,408
What

2377
02:07:47,456 --> 02:07:48,480
We'll have our women defense

2378
02:07:49,504 --> 02:07:55,648
That's crazy there's a lot of craziness to go

2379
02:07:55,904 --> 02:08:02,048
No it's not

2380
02:08:02,304 --> 02:08:08,448
Remember all the times you talked about Blackwater

2381
02:08:08,704 --> 02:08:12,544
Curious

2382
02:08:12,800 --> 02:08:14,848
But the other thing is he's using

2383
02:08:15,104 --> 02:08:17,152
Their perceived victimhood to try and

2384
02:08:17,664 --> 02:08:19,200
How many dollars is $2,000

2385
02:08:19,456 --> 02:08:24,832
Which is f***** up we can't send women out there their two-week by themselves

2386
02:08:26,368 --> 02:08:27,648
What happened to open carry

2387
02:08:28,160 --> 02:08:30,208
What happened to your whole life

2388
02:08:30,464 --> 02:08:35,072
Michael Moore is a hypocrite cuz he has armed guards whenever one should just carry guns themselves

2389
02:08:35,328 --> 02:08:37,888
Why not just give Millie and her Gunn

2390
02:08:40,704 --> 02:08:41,216
Fairlady

2391
02:08:41,472 --> 02:08:47,616
We can't allow the women to have

2392
02:08:47,872 --> 02:08:49,664
Don't think that that's what's motivating Alex

2393
02:08:49,920 --> 02:08:51,968
I think it's that he knows that that's bulshit

2394
02:08:52,224 --> 02:08:52,992
You need

2395
02:08:53,248 --> 02:08:54,528
A show of force

2396
02:08:54,784 --> 02:08:56,832
Around them

2397
02:08:57,088 --> 02:08:58,624
But he doesn't want them actually have a

2398
02:08:58,880 --> 02:08:59,392
Guns

2399
02:08:59,648 --> 02:09:00,672
He doesn't walk

2400
02:09:00,928 --> 02:09:01,696
These things escalated

2401
02:09:02,208 --> 02:09:04,512
He just wants like big muscle

2402
02:09:04,768 --> 02:09:05,280
Around

2403
02:09:05,536 --> 02:09:06,560
Infowars

2404
02:09:06,816 --> 02:09:12,960
Former Blackwater bodyguard killed today in a quote self-defense

2405
02:09:13,472 --> 02:09:14,240
I made it just come down

2406
02:09:14,496 --> 02:09:15,008
Misogyny

2407
02:09:15,264 --> 02:09:18,848
Chivalry

2408
02:09:19,360 --> 02:09:20,128
I don't know 100

2409
02:09:20,640 --> 02:09:25,504
So I don't know why I did this to myself but because Alex kept going on and on about these assaults

2410
02:09:25,760 --> 02:09:27,296
Started OverWatch

2411
02:09:27,552 --> 02:09:29,856
Although Kaitlyn's videos that you just put out

2412
02:09:30,112 --> 02:09:31,136
What you want down to Pride

2413
02:09:31,648 --> 02:09:33,952
Dashi playing the victim super aggressive

2414
02:09:34,464 --> 02:09:35,232
Looking for a soul to see

2415
02:09:35,488 --> 02:09:38,304
Never watched any long stretches of her working

2416
02:09:39,840 --> 02:09:40,352
She is

2417
02:09:40,608 --> 02:09:41,120
F******

2418
02:09:42,144 --> 02:09:42,656
Is a person

2419
02:09:42,912 --> 02:09:43,424
Palmistry

2420
02:09:43,680 --> 02:09:46,240
That that style of B

2421
02:09:48,032 --> 02:09:52,640
The only value that she has in that field as a as a person on the street reporter

2422
02:09:52,896 --> 02:09:53,664
Is that she doesn't

2423
02:09:53,920 --> 02:09:54,432
Stop talking

2424
02:09:54,944 --> 02:09:58,528
That's basically the only thing keeping the performance review

2425
02:09:58,784 --> 02:09:59,808
That would be in the pros

2426
02:10:00,064 --> 02:10:01,088
Everything else should be in the neck

2427
02:10:01,856 --> 02:10:02,880
Like you are

2428
02:10:03,136 --> 02:10:03,904
Don't stop

2429
02:10:04,928 --> 02:10:06,720
Looking for

2430
02:10:09,024 --> 02:10:13,632
The assault that you suffered is that some girl bumped into her and then pretended the cheat gotten pushed

2431
02:10:13,888 --> 02:10:14,400
That's why she

2432
02:10:17,216 --> 02:10:19,008
Later

2433
02:10:19,264 --> 02:10:20,288
To her because a ton of people

2434
02:10:20,544 --> 02:10:23,360
Complained about her behavior

2435
02:10:23,616 --> 02:10:25,664
She might get charged with disorderly conduct

2436
02:10:26,176 --> 02:10:27,712
Which is just not something that happens

2437
02:10:28,224 --> 02:10:29,248
Disrupting

2438
02:10:29,504 --> 02:10:32,064
Did you get up that stuff accounts with your behavior

2439
02:10:32,320 --> 02:10:33,088
Kaitlyn

2440
02:10:33,344 --> 02:10:34,880
Complain

2441
02:10:35,392 --> 02:10:41,536
Cop asked if she'd like to file a complaint you was very helpful

2442
02:10:41,792 --> 02:10:42,304
The Weeknd

2443
02:10:42,816 --> 02:10:44,096
Kaitlyn's and realizes

2444
02:10:44,352 --> 02:10:45,632
She has the assault on

2445
02:10:46,144 --> 02:10:47,680
So she considers filing

2446
02:10:47,936 --> 02:10:48,448
Play

2447
02:10:48,704 --> 02:10:51,264
But then she realizes that if she doesn't have to take her

2448
02:10:51,520 --> 02:10:55,872
Able to post this video

2449
02:10:57,664 --> 02:10:58,688
She so desperately

2450
02:10:59,200 --> 02:11:03,552
Immediately she's clear about not wanting to file a report and starts reframing the situation

2451
02:11:03,808 --> 02:11:04,832
Is the police wanting to

2452
02:11:05,344 --> 02:11:05,856
Skater proper

2453
02:11:06,624 --> 02:11:08,160
The cop handles himself quite well

2454
02:11:08,416 --> 02:11:10,464
Making it clear to her that he knows what games

2455
02:11:10,720 --> 02:11:12,256
She's playing and that if she wants to buy looking

2456
02:11:12,512 --> 02:11:13,280
Complained they can do it

2457
02:11:13,536 --> 02:11:15,840
But if she keeps bothering people that might be another

2458
02:11:18,912 --> 02:11:19,424
Keeps asking

2459
02:11:20,960 --> 02:11:21,472
Stop

2460
02:11:21,728 --> 02:11:22,752
Explaining to her

2461
02:11:23,008 --> 02:11:23,776
Consequences

2462
02:11:24,800 --> 02:11:25,312
If you're out in

2463
02:11:25,568 --> 02:11:26,336
Public

2464
02:11:26,848 --> 02:11:28,384
People keep complaining about your bike

2465
02:11:28,640 --> 02:11:29,152
You might be

2466
02:11:31,200 --> 02:11:34,016
Wellshire

2467
02:11:34,272 --> 02:11:36,832
If you're drunk and yelling at somebody

2468
02:11:37,088 --> 02:11:38,880
You could be asked to leave somewhere even if it's a public

2469
02:11:39,136 --> 02:11:39,648
What place

2470
02:11:40,416 --> 02:11:41,696
You're right they are

2471
02:11:41,952 --> 02:11:48,096
Absolutely suppressing the free-speech rights of Alcoholics in bars these days

2472
02:11:48,352 --> 02:11:53,216
Alex is going to take this up you might you might run

2473
02:11:53,472 --> 02:11:56,544
Drunk Twitter

2474
02:11:57,056 --> 02:12:02,688
Doesn't really pathetic display video

2475
02:12:04,992 --> 02:12:07,040
There is one woman

2476
02:12:08,320 --> 02:12:09,600
Is the f****** coolest

2477
02:12:10,112 --> 02:12:15,232
It's okay ones out there pretending to interview people and then just being like that

2478
02:12:17,024 --> 02:12:21,376
There's a really drunk girl with blue hair

2479
02:12:21,632 --> 02:12:22,144
If you keep saying

2480
02:12:22,400 --> 02:12:26,240
You're the gun girl

2481
02:12:26,496 --> 02:12:29,312
It's like she just keeps

2482
02:12:29,824 --> 02:12:32,640
Cracking herself up

2483
02:12:32,896 --> 02:12:39,040
Baby laugh so hard it's ever been on

2484
02:12:39,296 --> 02:12:40,064
Infowars Water Bar

2485
02:12:40,320 --> 02:12:41,600
It's delightful

2486
02:12:41,856 --> 02:12:43,136
That's great

2487
02:12:43,392 --> 02:12:49,280
That's so much more

2488
02:12:49,536 --> 02:12:55,680
Don't even bother

2489
02:12:55,936 --> 02:13:02,080
The lady got hit with a milkshake you are a lady.

2490
02:13:03,104 --> 02:13:08,224
Feeds into their victimhood, we are proud of

2491
02:13:10,528 --> 02:13:11,808
Imagined accomplished

2492
02:13:12,320 --> 02:13:14,368
I took a picture with a gun

2493
02:13:15,648 --> 02:13:20,256
Girl with sincerely laughing

2494
02:13:20,512 --> 02:13:22,560
About the idea that Kaitlin Bennett exist

2495
02:13:23,072 --> 02:13:23,840
Is

2496
02:13:24,096 --> 02:13:25,632
So delightful I love you

2497
02:13:25,888 --> 02:13:26,400
That is great

2498
02:13:26,656 --> 02:13:30,240
There's another clip that she has

2499
02:13:34,592 --> 02:13:37,920
You know what she has on

2500
02:13:38,432 --> 02:13:39,200
Egregious

2501
02:13:39,456 --> 02:13:41,504
What happened before this

2502
02:13:42,016 --> 02:13:46,112
Video clearly edited to make it look like it was completely unprompted

2503
02:13:47,136 --> 02:13:47,904
Seem like it is

2504
02:13:48,416 --> 02:13:52,000
Agonizing

2505
02:13:52,512 --> 02:13:54,304
Yelling at her so she can prove her victim

2506
02:13:58,400 --> 02:14:00,960
I definitely don't think it accurately portrays their interaction

2507
02:14:01,728 --> 02:14:02,496
It's propaganda

2508
02:14:03,008 --> 02:14:05,824
And the messages that Caitlin is a victim of leftist violence

2509
02:14:06,336 --> 02:14:06,848
That's what

2510
02:14:07,104 --> 02:14:08,896
The video is actually about

2511
02:14:09,152 --> 02:14:12,224
It's not about Pete buttegeig supporters at all

2512
02:14:12,736 --> 02:14:13,760
The message is

2513
02:14:14,016 --> 02:14:15,552
Leftist are attacking

2514
02:14:15,808 --> 02:14:16,320
This

2515
02:14:16,576 --> 02:14:17,856
Steeply white woman

2516
02:14:18,112 --> 02:14:19,136
Yeah that's what's going on

2517
02:14:20,160 --> 02:14:22,208
The last two-and-a-half years

2518
02:14:22,464 --> 02:14:24,512
I've listened to thousands of hours of Alex

2519
02:14:25,536 --> 02:14:27,584
But I would do that all over again for iWatch

2520
02:14:27,840 --> 02:14:30,400
Another 20 minutes of doing whatever it is

2521
02:14:30,656 --> 02:14:31,168
She does

2522
02:14:31,424 --> 02:14:34,496
It's just bad faith trolling masquerading as journalism

2523
02:14:34,752 --> 02:14:35,520
And more than that it's

2524
02:14:36,032 --> 02:14:36,544
Boring

2525
02:14:36,800 --> 02:14:38,592
Misinterprets news isn't it

2526
02:14:39,104 --> 02:14:39,616
Not interested

2527
02:14:39,872 --> 02:14:40,640
And she's not even really

2528
02:14:40,896 --> 02:14:42,688
Clever enough to spinner way out of most

2529
02:14:42,944 --> 02:14:43,456
Interactions with

2530
02:14:43,968 --> 02:14:44,480
She's talking to

2531
02:14:45,760 --> 02:14:49,344
Pride rally

2532
02:14:49,600 --> 02:14:50,880
Be there in just loves the attention

2533
02:14:51,392 --> 02:14:52,416
Do it she respond

2534
02:14:52,672 --> 02:14:55,232
And I'm getting it and I'm getting it I love it

2535
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:57,536
Propagandistic better control

2536
02:14:59,584 --> 02:15:00,096
2xist

2537
02:15:00,352 --> 02:15:02,912
It's really easy just to counter with something like what

2538
02:15:04,960 --> 02:15:06,240
Some dumb s*** like that

2539
02:15:06,496 --> 02:15:09,568
She doesn't even have the chops to think on her feet on that basic level it's

2540
02:15:09,824 --> 02:15:10,592
Disgraceful

2541
02:15:11,616 --> 02:15:12,384
But bottom line

2542
02:15:13,152 --> 02:15:18,016
That girl shouldn't have bumped into her but honestly I lose my ability to care about her complaint

2543
02:15:18,272 --> 02:15:20,320
Directly offered to take a complaint

2544
02:15:20,576 --> 02:15:21,600
File it for her

2545
02:15:23,904 --> 02:15:24,928
Would slow down the release

2546
02:15:25,440 --> 02:15:26,464
Propaganda victimhood beta

2547
02:15:26,720 --> 02:15:27,232
Nvidia

2548
02:15:27,744 --> 02:15:30,816
So I decided to look into our little bit because of how it's

2549
02:15:31,072 --> 02:15:31,840
Stream Alex isn't

2550
02:15:36,192 --> 02:15:37,216
Results and stuff but

2551
02:15:37,984 --> 02:15:39,776
That's why we talkin about a little bit

2552
02:15:40,032 --> 02:15:41,568
I promise I'm not going to talk about

2553
02:15:42,592 --> 02:15:43,872
I don't I don't have fiber in

2554
02:15:44,640 --> 02:15:46,432
Like I was trying to find a way to capture

2555
02:15:46,688 --> 02:15:49,248
Ashura at this is going to make sense

2556
02:15:49,760 --> 02:15:51,296
But like what are the things that make

2557
02:15:51,552 --> 02:15:53,344
Alex is propaganda

2558
02:15:53,856 --> 02:15:55,136
Is it's complicated

2559
02:15:55,648 --> 02:15:57,440
You know there's a bunch of things

2560
02:15:57,696 --> 02:15:58,720
Pretending to reference

2561
02:15:58,976 --> 02:16:00,768
The stories aren't easily like

2562
02:16:01,280 --> 02:16:05,120
Nikki if I were sitting down with him talking about stuff most of the time

2563
02:16:07,680 --> 02:16:08,192
YouTube

2564
02:16:08,448 --> 02:16:10,752
With Caitlin it's so easy

2565
02:16:11,008 --> 02:16:16,384
Oh no I understand

2566
02:16:17,408 --> 02:16:19,200
The willful misinterpretations

2567
02:16:20,224 --> 02:16:20,736
Surface lot

2568
02:16:21,248 --> 02:16:22,528
That she's doing and it's just

2569
02:16:26,112 --> 02:16:26,624
It's

2570
02:16:26,880 --> 02:16:30,976
I hate to say that it sits beneath the class of

2571
02:16:34,048 --> 02:16:37,120
Is that you want to look at

2572
02:16:37,376 --> 02:16:37,888
Fair enough

2573
02:16:40,448 --> 02:16:41,472
Talks about the

2574
02:16:41,728 --> 02:16:42,496
Rich oil

2575
02:16:43,008 --> 02:16:43,520
Texas

2576
02:16:43,776 --> 02:16:45,568
She's related to

2577
02:16:46,080 --> 02:16:47,360
Something very

2578
02:16:48,896 --> 02:16:51,200
I want to hire security

2579
02:16:52,736 --> 02:16:54,784
Texas oil families

2580
02:16:58,112 --> 02:17:00,672
Then like all you're doing great Alex people have helicopters

2581
02:17:01,184 --> 02:17:05,024
Sounds like I got the money

2582
02:17:06,048 --> 02:17:07,840
IPads

2583
02:17:10,144 --> 02:17:12,192
Never give a damn.

2584
02:17:12,960 --> 02:17:14,496
Stingy

2585
02:17:15,264 --> 02:17:20,896
Literally never heard Alex talk about people in Texas who have helicopter pads

2586
02:17:21,152 --> 02:17:21,664
Super super

2587
02:17:21,920 --> 02:17:22,944
Except when he's

2588
02:17:23,200 --> 02:17:27,552
Specifically describing the people who try to

2589
02:17:29,344 --> 02:17:31,392
The only other time helicopter pads

2590
02:17:31,648 --> 02:17:33,952
In Texas have come up with rich people

2591
02:17:34,208 --> 02:17:38,048
He's related to The Satanist to try to lure him

2592
02:17:39,584 --> 02:17:44,192
Fear the Reaper secure Ark today

2593
02:17:44,704 --> 02:17:47,776
Then I think I accidentally stumbled onto something

2594
02:17:49,056 --> 02:17:49,824
Possible and

2595
02:17:50,080 --> 02:17:54,688
The other possibility is this imagined

2596
02:17:54,944 --> 02:17:55,456
Richmond

2597
02:17:55,712 --> 02:17:56,992
Mansion with helicopter pad

2598
02:17:57,248 --> 02:17:57,760
The only thing

2599
02:17:58,016 --> 02:18:00,320
His brain can really pull up as an image

2600
02:18:00,576 --> 02:18:01,856
Of this

2601
02:18:02,112 --> 02:18:04,416
High-class opulent wealth

2602
02:18:04,928 --> 02:18:06,208
Describe the Satanist Tesla

2603
02:18:06,464 --> 02:18:06,976
Like really

2604
02:18:07,232 --> 02:18:08,256
Helicopter pad

2605
02:18:09,536 --> 02:18:13,120
I think it's either he's a Satanist or he has a childish imagination

2606
02:18:13,376 --> 02:18:14,144
Only has a

2607
02:18:14,400 --> 02:18:15,424
Few stops along the way

2608
02:18:15,936 --> 02:18:17,728
Does actually

2609
02:18:17,984 --> 02:18:21,312
Perfect sense that he has a childhood imagination regarding

2610
02:18:21,568 --> 02:18:24,128
Wealth because that is how people

2611
02:18:24,640 --> 02:18:25,664
Viewers like that

2612
02:18:26,944 --> 02:18:28,992
Is a

2613
02:18:29,248 --> 02:18:30,272
Very like

2614
02:18:32,064 --> 02:18:32,576
You know

2615
02:18:34,880 --> 02:18:35,648
View of

2616
02:18:35,904 --> 02:18:42,048
Gold Apartments display

2617
02:18:42,560 --> 02:18:48,192
Yeah. You know so of course get on his train because look

2618
02:18:48,704 --> 02:18:49,472
It's the very

2619
02:18:49,984 --> 02:18:51,008
Picture of what ice

2620
02:18:52,288 --> 02:18:52,800
Success

2621
02:18:54,336 --> 02:19:00,480
That much worse

2622
02:19:01,760 --> 02:19:02,272
Exactly

2623
02:19:04,320 --> 02:19:04,832
Man

2624
02:19:05,856 --> 02:19:07,136
One of the things I love the most

2625
02:19:07,648 --> 02:19:08,416
That Alex Jones

2626
02:19:08,672 --> 02:19:09,184
10 years ago

2627
02:19:09,952 --> 02:19:11,232
Hearing him sing along with the highway

2628
02:19:12,512 --> 02:19:13,536
And it turns out Alex

2629
02:19:14,304 --> 02:19:15,328
He's drunk

2630
02:19:15,840 --> 02:19:16,352
Also like

2631
02:19:16,608 --> 02:19:17,632
Talk about The Highwaymen

2632
02:19:18,400 --> 02:19:19,936
It's not as fun anymore

2633
02:19:26,848 --> 02:19:32,992
How did Daytona

2634
02:19:33,248 --> 02:19:39,392
Silver Bullet before and after I was in the Ebola camp

2635
02:19:58,848 --> 02:20:00,896
Everywhere is a sign other downfall

2636
02:20:01,408 --> 02:20:01,920
Whatever

2637
02:20:09,856 --> 02:20:13,696
You like selling silver bullet

2638
02:20:13,952 --> 02:20:20,096
Auto professional

2639
02:20:20,352 --> 02:20:26,496
I know that moment man I've been there

2640
02:20:27,520 --> 02:20:29,312

Deluxe

2642
02:20:32,128 --> 02:20:33,920

2643
02:20:35,968 --> 02:20:37,248
What is a bad luck

2644
02:20:37,760 --> 02:20:39,296
Cuz he starts talking about

2645
02:20:40,064 --> 02:20:41,344
Any slips

2646
02:20:50,560 --> 02:20:51,328
Penn State

2647
02:20:54,656 --> 02:20:56,960
You have been on fire

2648
02:20:58,240 --> 02:21:04,128
Elijah

2649
02:21:04,384 --> 02:21:06,432

2650
02:21:06,944 --> 02:21:10,016
I salute you

2651
02:21:13,088 --> 02:21:16,672

I love my wife I'm not saying I want on your truck

2653
02:21:19,744 --> 02:21:21,536
I am envious of you

2654
02:21:21,792 --> 02:21:24,352
Why are you envious of her fiance

2655
02:21:24,608 --> 02:21:29,984
Why would you why would you

2656
02:21:30,240 --> 02:21:31,264
Compliments

2657
02:21:31,520 --> 02:21:33,056
Like the idea of being like

2658
02:21:34,080 --> 02:21:35,104
You're so great

2659
02:21:35,360 --> 02:21:38,176
I'm envious of your husband are your fiance forgetting

2660
02:21:38,432 --> 02:21:38,944
To be with you

2661
02:21:39,200 --> 02:21:40,736
Necessarily meaning

2662
02:21:44,832 --> 02:21:47,648
Idea it's not it's not inappropriate

2663
02:21:53,280 --> 02:21:58,656
Grosse Ile real slip

2664
02:22:00,704 --> 02:22:03,520
Look what what is Alex know about Caitlin's fiance

2665
02:22:04,032 --> 02:22:05,312
He exists

2666
02:22:07,104 --> 02:22:10,688
To be with her nose

2667
02:22:10,944 --> 02:22:12,992
I'm envious of your fiance

2668
02:22:14,272 --> 02:22:15,040
So

2669
02:22:17,856 --> 02:22:18,368
You haven't heard

2670
02:22:19,648 --> 02:22:20,928
He restarts to give a speech

2671
02:22:21,440 --> 02:22:22,208
About gender

2672
02:22:22,720 --> 02:22:27,840
That's very very interesting perspective bring it to the table

2673
02:22:28,608 --> 02:22:31,168
Every woman is half her father

2674
02:22:31,680 --> 02:22:36,032
Every son is half his mother we are unified there is no sex

2675
02:22:36,288 --> 02:22:41,664
We are humans humans are unified in total collectivism

2676
02:22:41,920 --> 02:22:44,736
Individualism

2677
02:22:51,136 --> 02:22:56,512
Cool

2678
02:23:01,120 --> 02:23:02,912
Those words all mean things

2679
02:23:03,168 --> 02:23:04,704
But when you put them together

2680
02:23:05,984 --> 02:23:12,128
I mean I guess he's saying it like there is no clear-cut genders and all that stuff is

2681
02:23:13,920 --> 02:23:14,688
Come around

2682
02:23:14,944 --> 02:23:19,296
All the time

2683
02:23:23,392 --> 02:23:25,440
Alex again

2684
02:23:25,696 --> 02:23:28,000
Is expressing a

2685
02:23:30,560 --> 02:23:31,840
They're still on this

2686
02:23:32,096 --> 02:23:32,864
And Cubans

2687
02:23:33,376 --> 02:23:35,168
Discussing about how she believes that

2688
02:23:35,424 --> 02:23:36,192
Gender roles

2689
02:23:36,448 --> 02:23:39,264
Specific gender roles are what gives Society it's

2690
02:23:39,520 --> 02:23:40,032
Strength

2691
02:23:41,824 --> 02:23:42,848
Alex respond

2692
02:23:43,360 --> 02:23:43,872
Very bizarre

2693
02:23:44,896 --> 02:23:49,760
Another there's a lot of people a lot of Democrats and feminist

2694
02:23:56,928 --> 02:24:03,072
To simply just be moms

2695
02:24:03,328 --> 02:24:09,472
How does gender roles there's nothing wrong

2696
02:24:09,728 --> 02:24:15,360
American culture is so strong is because we have gender roles

2697
02:24:15,872 --> 02:24:16,896
Down a pedestal

2698
02:24:21,248 --> 02:24:22,016
Mama

2699
02:24:22,528 --> 02:24:23,040
Quo

2700
02:24:24,320 --> 02:24:24,832
That's weird

2701
02:24:25,088 --> 02:24:28,160
That's weird

2702
02:24:28,672 --> 02:24:30,976
You know in the same way that

2703
02:24:31,232 --> 02:24:34,816
Like empathize with the situation where Alex is going to is get

2704
02:24:35,328 --> 02:24:36,352
Tossed aside and

2705
02:24:36,864 --> 02:24:38,400
No loyalty from Rodger Stone

2706
02:24:38,912 --> 02:24:40,704
In the same way it's like with her and

2707
02:24:40,960 --> 02:24:41,472
And Alex

2708
02:24:41,984 --> 02:24:44,032
I get you are you

2709
02:24:44,288 --> 02:24:48,640
Support right-wing positions and everything

2710
02:24:50,688 --> 02:24:52,224
Second-class citizen so

2711
02:24:52,480 --> 02:24:53,504
You know I

2712
02:24:54,016 --> 02:24:55,040
He's going to be

2713
02:24:57,856 --> 02:24:59,136
I'm sorry

2714
02:24:59,392 --> 02:25:05,536
But up on each other it's hard to figure out

2715
02:25:05,792 --> 02:25:06,304
Anytime

2716
02:25:07,584 --> 02:25:08,352
So

2717
02:25:08,608 --> 02:25:11,168
What is really important to

2718
02:25:11,424 --> 02:25:15,008
Just got here really surface-level misunderstand

2719
02:25:16,544 --> 02:25:18,080
If anybody thinks

2720
02:25:18,336 --> 02:25:19,104
Wearing pink

2721
02:25:19,616 --> 02:25:21,920
Being a mother is somehow again

2722
02:25:22,176 --> 02:25:23,200
Feminism or

2723
02:25:23,456 --> 02:25:26,272
Is against the principles of the last

2724
02:25:26,528 --> 02:25:29,856
I don't think there are many people who actually believe

2725
02:25:30,368 --> 02:25:31,904
Surface-level missing

2726
02:25:32,160 --> 02:25:32,928
Understanding that she has

2727
02:25:33,440 --> 02:25:34,208
Is the idea

2728
02:25:35,232 --> 02:25:35,744
You felt

2729
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:38,048
Made to feel like they need

2730
02:25:38,560 --> 02:25:41,120
Subscribe to these gender roles is the problem

2731
02:25:43,168 --> 02:25:45,216
Traditionally feminine

2732
02:25:45,472 --> 02:25:46,752
Is or what you must

2733
02:25:47,264 --> 02:25:47,776
Subscribed

2734
02:25:48,032 --> 02:25:48,544
Do what you must

2735
02:25:48,800 --> 02:25:49,312
Manifest

2736
02:25:49,568 --> 02:25:50,592
You need to

2737
02:25:50,848 --> 02:25:53,408
Have children or else you're not a full woman

2738
02:25:53,664 --> 02:25:57,504
Those sorts of ideas are the things that feminism

2739
02:25:58,016 --> 02:25:58,528
Orepros

2740
02:25:59,296 --> 02:26:02,112
Well that was one of the central conflict

2741
02:26:02,368 --> 02:26:04,672
Second-wave feminism is whether or not

2742
02:26:04,928 --> 02:26:05,952
Wit it was

2743
02:26:06,208 --> 02:26:09,280
Like the driver was absolutely rejecting

2744
02:26:11,584 --> 02:26:13,376
And acting out in

2745
02:26:14,912 --> 02:26:18,496
We can no longer just be considered mothers and all of that

2746
02:26:18,752 --> 02:26:23,104
Participate in those behaviors haha

2747
02:26:23,616 --> 02:26:25,920
And I took the same bulshit that

2748
02:26:27,456 --> 02:26:28,224
Social context

2749
02:26:28,480 --> 02:26:30,016
Did that exist

2750
02:26:30,272 --> 02:26:36,416
What social context do we exist

2751
02:26:36,672 --> 02:26:42,560
What's second-wave feminism

2752
02:26:42,816 --> 02:26:43,584
Like

2753
02:26:45,120 --> 02:26:45,632
Choose

2754
02:26:45,888 --> 02:26:47,168
As long as you have

2755
02:26:47,424 --> 02:26:47,936
Agency

2756
02:26:48,448 --> 02:26:49,984
And complete

2757
02:26:54,848 --> 02:26:56,384
They're trying to race

2758
02:26:56,640 --> 02:26:58,176
With the understanding

2759
02:26:58,432 --> 02:26:58,944
That like

2760
02:26:59,456 --> 02:27:00,992
I'm not giving you

2761
02:27:01,248 --> 02:27:02,784
Toys

2762
02:27:03,040 --> 02:27:04,576
Make your bedroom

2763
02:27:05,088 --> 02:27:05,856
Not going to give

2764
02:27:06,368 --> 02:27:08,160
Barbie dolls

2765
02:27:08,416 --> 02:27:09,440
Like over the top

2766
02:27:10,464 --> 02:27:13,536
Puzzles that are age

2767
02:27:14,048 --> 02:27:15,584
And that is

2768
02:27:15,840 --> 02:27:16,864
Something that is like

2769
02:27:17,120 --> 02:27:18,912
Gravitate towards those things

2770
02:27:19,168 --> 02:27:19,936
I will stop

2771
02:27:21,216 --> 02:27:22,496
Exactly

2772
02:27:22,752 --> 02:27:23,520
Expectation

2773
02:27:23,776 --> 02:27:26,336
For you I think that's the subtle difference

2774
02:27:26,592 --> 02:27:28,640
Caitlin and Alex

2775
02:27:28,896 --> 02:27:29,408
Don't

2776
02:27:29,664 --> 02:27:30,176
Understand

2777
02:27:30,688 --> 02:27:31,712
A pushback on as

2778
02:27:31,968 --> 02:27:32,736
If it were

2779
02:27:32,992 --> 02:27:33,760
A condemnation

2780
02:27:36,320 --> 02:27:37,600
If you want us subscribers

2781
02:27:37,856 --> 02:27:39,648
Gender-role because that

2782
02:27:39,904 --> 02:27:40,928
What you want

2783
02:27:41,696 --> 02:27:42,208
Who gives a s***

2784
02:27:46,560 --> 02:27:50,400
There are some people that's not indicative of

2785
02:27:50,912 --> 02:27:52,192
The groups that they real on

2786
02:27:52,448 --> 02:27:55,264
Yeah I got well I'm in currently

2787
02:27:55,776 --> 02:28:00,128
Clean the whole day's pay take care of animals

2788
02:28:00,640 --> 02:28:03,968
I am feeling when I cook so I'm feeling what would be

2789
02:28:04,224 --> 02:28:04,736
Considered the trip

2790
02:28:04,992 --> 02:28:07,552
Additional

2791
02:28:07,808 --> 02:28:11,392
Dare you act like that

2792
02:28:11,648 --> 02:28:12,928
Have these ideas

2793
02:28:13,184 --> 02:28:14,208
On their head

2794
02:28:14,464 --> 02:28:14,976
AR

2795
02:28:15,232 --> 02:28:16,256
Like really rigid about

2796
02:28:16,512 --> 02:28:19,328
Are the people the people who are in these

2797
02:28:19,584 --> 02:28:20,352
Traditional

2798
02:28:20,608 --> 02:28:21,632
Expectation

2799
02:28:21,888 --> 02:28:22,400
Beers

2800
02:28:22,656 --> 02:28:26,496
It's people like Lawrence there and have come out and talk about how they don't want

2801
02:28:26,752 --> 02:28:27,264
Necessarily

2802
02:28:29,056 --> 02:28:31,104
Pasture-raised their fan bases

2803
02:28:31,616 --> 02:28:33,408
They got pretty mad about that

2804
02:28:33,664 --> 02:28:36,736
They are the ones who are imposing something on other people

2805
02:28:37,248 --> 02:28:37,760
As opposed to

2806
02:28:38,272 --> 02:28:39,552
Like I don't have it

2807
02:28:39,808 --> 02:28:40,320
I don't know

2808
02:28:40,576 --> 02:28:42,368
I can't speak for everybody but

2809
02:28:42,880 --> 02:28:43,904
Anything about Kaitlin Bennett

2810
02:28:44,160 --> 02:28:46,464
But I've ever been offended by it

2811
02:28:46,720 --> 02:28:47,232
Dresses

2812
02:28:48,512 --> 02:28:49,792
You're not having long hair

2813
02:28:50,048 --> 02:28:51,584
The things that she brings up as her

2814
02:28:51,840 --> 02:28:52,352
Her feminine

2815
02:28:58,496 --> 02:29:01,568
I just wish they'd get a little more

2816
02:29:04,384 --> 02:29:05,920
Because it's

2817
02:29:06,432 --> 02:29:09,248
Also some of that gender roles

2818
02:29:10,016 --> 02:29:10,784
The stuff is

2819
02:29:11,296 --> 02:29:11,808
Self Justice

2820
02:29:12,320 --> 02:29:13,600
Along the way is

2821
02:29:14,112 --> 02:29:15,136
It is

2822
02:29:15,648 --> 02:29:21,536
It is comforting to believe if you are in a gender role that you are supposed to be

2823
02:29:22,048 --> 02:29:23,840
Watching people

2824
02:29:24,096 --> 02:29:25,120
Do stuff that you

2825
02:29:25,888 --> 02:29:26,912
Feel like you can't

2826
02:29:27,680 --> 02:29:29,216
You then have to be like

2827
02:29:29,472 --> 02:29:31,264
Because they're wrong

2828
02:29:31,776 --> 02:29:37,152
Otherwise you're going to have to do a lot of self-reflection.

2829
02:29:37,664 --> 02:29:40,224
One last pretty long

2830
02:29:40,992 --> 02:29:41,760
Because

2831
02:29:42,272 --> 02:29:42,784
Like I said

2832
02:29:45,600 --> 02:29:46,368
These f*****-up

2833
02:29:46,624 --> 02:29:47,136
Chinese like

2834
02:29:47,648 --> 02:29:53,280
I'm jealous of your fiance

2835
02:29:54,304 --> 02:29:55,328
He's all over the place

2836
02:29:55,584 --> 02:29:58,144
So he comes back after Kaitlyn

2837
02:29:58,656 --> 02:30:00,192
Leaves and Owens gone

2838
02:30:00,960 --> 02:30:04,544
And I've never done this before but I'm going to play an entire segment

2839
02:30:05,312 --> 02:30:06,592
Commercial to commercial

2840
02:30:06,848 --> 02:30:07,616
Of his last

2841
02:30:07,872 --> 02:30:09,664
On the 11th

2842
02:30:09,920 --> 02:30:10,688
His last

2843
02:30:10,944 --> 02:30:11,968
Commercial break

2844
02:30:12,480 --> 02:30:16,064
Paul Joseph Watson

2845
02:30:16,576 --> 02:30:18,368
Because it is an absurd

2846
02:30:18,880 --> 02:30:19,648
Thing

2847
02:30:20,160 --> 02:30:20,672
And I think

2848
02:30:20,928 --> 02:30:23,488
You know I don't think people understand like

2849
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,560
What does shippo sometimes like

2850
02:30:26,816 --> 02:30:28,096
This is an entire

2851
02:30:28,352 --> 02:30:28,864
Segment

2852
02:30:29,376 --> 02:30:35,520
I want to get this out front for people because I'm not her

2853
02:30:39,104 --> 02:30:40,896
Some really bad forces

2854
02:30:41,408 --> 02:30:46,016
Kirkland right now which is fine I expected this I wanted to fight Asheville gun

2855
02:30:46,528 --> 02:30:49,856
Weird stuff going on and really bad people

2856
02:30:54,208 --> 02:30:56,000
Humanity for a future

2857
02:30:58,304 --> 02:31:01,120
The lottery like don't you know well

2858
02:31:01,376 --> 02:31:03,424
Will do this will do that and I'm like

2859
02:31:03,936 --> 02:31:07,008
Yeah I know how that's why I did what I did 25 years ago

2860
02:31:08,288 --> 02:31:09,312
But

2861
02:31:10,848 --> 02:31:12,640
Really pissed off right now

2862
02:31:13,152 --> 02:31:13,920
Who

2863
02:31:14,432 --> 02:31:15,456
Conceal

2864
02:31:15,712 --> 02:31:18,272
2019

2865
02:31:19,552 --> 02:31:21,344
Internet Crossroads

2866
02:31:23,904 --> 02:31:28,000
Out of my fellow Americans that make me ashamed in America

2867
02:31:29,280 --> 02:31:32,608
American

2868
02:31:32,864 --> 02:31:33,888
Proud

2869
02:31:34,912 --> 02:31:36,448
Where is minute in and he hasn't said any

2870
02:31:36,704 --> 02:31:42,848
Nothing

2871
02:31:45,920 --> 02:31:50,016
Great some bad Lottery

2872
02:31:50,528 --> 02:31:52,832
Nothing these words mean nothing they're so vague

2873
02:31:53,344 --> 02:31:53,856
Bulshit

2874
02:31:56,672 --> 02:31:58,208
Natural Paradox here

2875
02:32:01,536 --> 02:32:02,816
1 trillion %

2876
02:32:03,328 --> 02:32:06,400
Owl shell out one damn piece

2877
02:32:06,656 --> 02:32:07,680
Bar agenda

2878
02:32:07,936 --> 02:32:10,752
I will settle it out of court to 1%

2879
02:32:11,776 --> 02:32:13,568
In fact I'll probably die of a heart attack

2880
02:32:14,336 --> 02:32:15,872
Worried that I'm not fighting this artist

2881
02:32:16,128 --> 02:32:17,664
Special

2882
02:32:21,504 --> 02:32:23,040
I just have so blessed

2883
02:32:23,552 --> 02:32:25,600
2019-w

2884
02:32:26,624 --> 02:32:28,416
Shake your hands on straight

2885
02:32:29,184 --> 02:32:30,464
Associate

2886
02:32:31,232 --> 02:32:33,536
Not read your email

2887
02:32:34,304 --> 02:32:35,584
Estranged

2888
02:32:37,376 --> 02:32:38,912
I just wish I was wiser

2889
02:32:40,192 --> 02:32:41,216
Bible says

2890
02:32:42,496 --> 02:32:43,776
I wish I was wise

2891
02:32:44,032 --> 02:32:48,384
Matthew 11

2892
02:32:49,664 --> 02:32:52,224
Because I've been far beyond the Realms of death

2893
02:32:52,480 --> 02:32:58,624
Because you're dumb and violent

2894
02:32:59,904 --> 02:33:02,208
Senior planner

2895
02:33:05,024 --> 02:33:07,072
Currently doing this is so crazy

2896
02:33:10,144 --> 02:33:14,752
Good man and good women

2897
02:33:15,776 --> 02:33:17,312
We're just trying to live our lives

2898
02:33:18,592 --> 02:33:20,640
And because we weren't shaytan

2899
02:33:21,408 --> 02:33:23,456
We could never imagine people were

2900
02:33:24,992 --> 02:33:26,528
Let me tell you something folks

2901
02:33:27,808 --> 02:33:29,344
Evil is real

2902
02:33:30,112 --> 02:33:31,904
As the sun coming up in the morning

2903
02:33:38,304 --> 02:33:42,144
Thomas Jefferson said 40-something years ago

2904
02:33:46,752 --> 02:33:47,264
Flourish

2905
02:33:48,288 --> 02:33:49,312
Good man

2906
02:33:50,336 --> 02:33:50,848
Do nothing

2907
02:33:51,616 --> 02:33:53,408
So this is Batangas Jeff

2908
02:33:53,664 --> 02:33:56,992
Is very excited.

2909
02:33:57,248 --> 02:34:02,624
What is a like Thomas Jefferson said who actually real quote

2910
02:34:02,880 --> 02:34:07,232
Retribution

2911
02:34:07,744 --> 02:34:11,584
Cuz very commonly quote is erroneously attributed to Edmund Burke

2912
02:34:12,096 --> 02:34:14,912
Even made that mistake in the future delivered back in 19

2913
02:34:15,424 --> 02:34:17,984
No record of Edmund Burke

2914
02:34:18,752 --> 02:34:21,312
Traces back to the philosopher John Stuart Mill

2915
02:34:21,568 --> 02:34:23,360
The original quotes quotes

2916
02:34:23,616 --> 02:34:28,224
More to Compass their ends should look on and do nothing

2917
02:34:28,736 --> 02:34:31,040
From that point forward it was Game telephone

2918
02:34:31,296 --> 02:34:33,600
John Stuart Mill's

2919
02:34:34,112 --> 02:34:37,952
I can't even find any real evidence to anyone other than Alex Bigsby

2920
02:34:39,744 --> 02:34:42,304
Every single time Alex Jones price quote Thomas Jefferson

2921
02:34:42,560 --> 02:34:45,120
Is it completely fake quote or something someone else said

2922
02:34:46,144 --> 02:34:48,960
Complete idiot knows literally nothing about the person

2923
02:34:49,216 --> 02:34:49,728
Who is this

2924
02:34:50,496 --> 02:34:52,032
Yeah that is really funny

2925
02:34:52,800 --> 02:34:54,848
Quotes Thomas Jefferson all the time

2926
02:34:55,104 --> 02:34:56,384
All the time and yet

2927
02:34:56,640 --> 02:34:57,152
Never

2928
02:34:57,408 --> 02:34:59,712
Does he know anything

2929
02:35:00,480 --> 02:35:02,784
DPS humble or

2930
02:35:05,088 --> 02:35:07,136
It's always crazy to me because I'm not

2931
02:35:07,392 --> 02:35:08,416
I don't think we've forced

2932
02:35:08,928 --> 02:35:15,072
Or anything like that but

2933
02:35:21,472 --> 02:35:23,520
Universe Works

2934
02:35:28,128 --> 02:35:28,896
Justice

2935
02:35:29,664 --> 02:35:31,712
Universe tends towards Justice

2936
02:35:32,480 --> 02:35:33,504
I'm at a little secret

2937
02:35:34,016 --> 02:35:35,808
So that's not

2938
02:35:38,880 --> 02:35:40,416
But it is not a quote of his purse

2939
02:35:41,440 --> 02:35:44,768
Number for The Arc of the universe be

2940
02:35:48,864 --> 02:35:50,912
After the Montgomery Bus Boycott

2941
02:35:51,424 --> 02:35:53,728
The first person to be credited with expression is

2942
02:35:53,984 --> 02:35:54,496
Parker

2943
02:35:55,008 --> 02:35:57,056
A Unitarian Minister and noted abolitionist

2944
02:35:57,568 --> 02:35:58,848
Who did the phrase in it

2945
02:35:59,360 --> 02:36:00,128
1053 book

2946
02:36:00,384 --> 02:36:01,664
Sermons of religion

2947
02:36:02,432 --> 02:36:03,456
This one's more except

2948
02:36:03,712 --> 02:36:07,040
Possible for Alex to know the history of make it much more

2949
02:36:07,296 --> 02:36:07,808
More popular

2950
02:36:09,088 --> 02:36:11,904
I'd like to explain how all Alex really knows our sound

2951
02:36:12,416 --> 02:36:13,696
We have no idea of the contest

2952
02:36:14,976 --> 02:36:15,488
Talk about it

2953
02:36:16,512 --> 02:36:18,048
What was Martin Luther King

2954
02:36:18,304 --> 02:36:19,328
Peter Parker

2955
02:36:19,584 --> 02:36:20,096
Heated Alec

2956
02:36:20,864 --> 02:36:21,632
And everything you say

2957
02:36:22,656 --> 02:36:23,680
So

2958
02:36:23,936 --> 02:36:24,704
Is b*******

2959
02:36:30,592 --> 02:36:32,896
If you don't stand up against

2960
02:36:33,664 --> 02:36:34,176
You might be ready

2961
02:36:37,248 --> 02:36:39,808
Soap opera

2962
02:36:40,576 --> 02:36:43,136
It doesn't matter universe

2963
02:36:43,904 --> 02:36:46,208
If you don't

2964
02:36:46,720 --> 02:36:48,512
And if you don't take Lex

2965
02:36:49,024 --> 02:36:50,048
The truth

2966
02:36:50,560 --> 02:36:51,584
God will reject you

2967
02:36:54,656 --> 02:36:57,216
Jesus Christ as your lord and savior of support

2968
02:36:58,240 --> 02:37:00,800
But if you really take Jesus Christ

2969
02:37:01,568 --> 02:37:02,848
Is your lord savior

2970
02:37:03,360 --> 02:37:05,152
You're going to stand up against

2971
02:37:05,664 --> 02:37:06,432
So I don't think

2972
02:37:06,688 --> 02:37:07,968
He said really much event

2973
02:37:10,272 --> 02:37:11,552
Play Pacific

2974
02:37:11,808 --> 02:37:13,856
It's all vague platitudes

2975
02:37:14,368 --> 02:37:14,880
Pics of the universe

2976
02:37:15,392 --> 02:37:18,976
Reminds me of somebody

2977
02:37:19,232 --> 02:37:20,512
Channeling someone saying

2978
02:37:20,768 --> 02:37:23,328
You don't need to do a different voice

2979
02:37:23,584 --> 02:37:27,680
If someone who thinks they have something profound to say and

2980
02:37:29,984 --> 02:37:31,008
I want to make this clear

2981
02:37:33,824 --> 02:37:34,592
We are just pausing it

2982
02:37:38,688 --> 02:37:42,272
Cold devil worshiping World God

2983
02:37:44,064 --> 02:37:46,368
World government

2984

Marco's Beach

2985
02:37:48,160 --> 02:37:49,952
Mustache

2986
02:37:52,768 --> 02:37:53,792
Ladies and gentlemen

2987
02:37:54,304 --> 02:37:55,840
I'll give you a news flash

2988
02:37:56,608 --> 02:37:57,632

Israel

2990

Jesus Christ is real

2991
02:38:03,264 --> 02:38:04,544
Baphomet

2992
02:38:05,312 --> 02:38:07,872

Free-will like he does

2997
02:38:24,512 --> 02:38:25,280
On a planet

2998
02:38:25,792 --> 02:38:27,584
Realizing those children

2999
02:38:27,840 --> 02:38:29,632
Face free will

3000
02:38:31,680 --> 02:38:34,496
And so God I won rule if I'm going to give birth

I'm going to have to let my failure Lucifer upon

3003
02:38:41,408 --> 02:38:42,944
That's the only rule

The devil on

02:38:50,624 --> 02:38:55,488
Negotiated Jefferson said you better sick the devil Autumn otherwise it's going to be long

3006
02:38:57,280 --> 02:38:58,048

Because they deserve to be free will

3012
02:39:10,336 --> 02:39:12,384
You don't give somebody free will

3013
02:39:14,432 --> 02:39:15,200
Create

3014
02:39:16,480 --> 02:39:17,248
Robot

3015
02:39:17,504 --> 02:39:18,528
It's the system

3016
02:39:21,856 --> 02:39:23,648
Child

3017
02:39:23,904 --> 02:39:24,928
Ketchup

3018
02:39:25,184 --> 02:39:25,952
For the devil

3019
02:39:26,208 --> 02:39:27,488
They're going to die someday

3020
02:39:27,744 --> 02:39:30,048
Child is to give death

3021
02:39:31,328 --> 02:39:37,216
To have a child

3022
02:39:39,520 --> 02:39:45,664
To have a child is to give birth to death

3023
02:39:45,920 --> 02:39:52,064
Alex storm here I love the black light posters but I got to get the f*** out of here

3024
02:39:52,320 --> 02:39:56,160
Got to go home

3025
02:39:56,416 --> 02:39:58,720
I really really love your

3026
02:39:58,976 --> 02:40:03,072
Einstein with his tongue out poster I think it's really cool

3027
02:40:03,328 --> 02:40:04,864
Chicago

3028
02:40:05,120 --> 02:40:05,888
Perfect love it

3029
02:40:07,424 --> 02:40:08,448
University.

3030
02:40:11,264 --> 02:40:12,288
You have a child

3031
02:40:13,056 --> 02:40:15,872
You're turning them loose in the universe like a ship a little sale

3032
02:40:16,128 --> 02:40:17,920
Thomas big ocean of consciousness

3033
02:40:21,504 --> 02:40:22,784
So that's God's big safe

3034
02:40:24,320 --> 02:40:28,160
What is the soul of the world he sent his only begotten son

3035
02:40:29,184 --> 02:40:30,976
Should anyone believe upon him

3036
02:40:31,744 --> 02:40:35,840
If you think that's stupid that's some preacher

3037
02:40:36,096 --> 02:40:37,120
It's free will

3038
02:40:37,376 --> 02:40:38,144
Not stupid

3039
02:40:39,424 --> 02:40:39,936
Secret

3040
02:40:40,192 --> 02:40:43,520
Is the verse in the Bible that literally everyone knows

3041
02:40:44,544 --> 02:40:45,824
That's a poorly kept sea

3042
02:40:46,080 --> 02:40:46,848
Yeah yeah

3043
02:40:47,872 --> 02:40:50,944
Consciousness but you've got to decide

3044
02:40:53,248 --> 02:40:54,016
Systems

3045
02:40:54,528 --> 02:40:56,320
You want to follow God's program

3046
02:40:57,344 --> 02:40:58,368
It's a program

3047
02:40:58,880 --> 02:41:00,416
You're like walking Best Buy

3048
02:41:00,672 --> 02:41:02,720
Jesus Christ

3049
02:41:07,072 --> 02:41:09,120
Problems

3050
02:41:11,936 --> 02:41:15,008
DoubleTree Boston with program OK Google

3051
02:41:17,824 --> 02:41:18,592
This is real life

3052
02:41:19,104 --> 02:41:20,384
But you're going to

3053
02:41:20,640 --> 02:41:24,736
Cuz you know you never got a job

3054
02:41:26,784 --> 02:41:28,064
I just want to make sure

3055
02:41:32,160 --> 02:41:33,952
I feel there's something big

3056
02:41:34,208 --> 02:41:34,720
Going on

3057
02:41:34,976 --> 02:41:38,816
This is where I mean

3058
02:41:39,072 --> 02:41:40,608
Alex says I'm becoming up

3059
02:41:40,864 --> 02:41:41,888
You might need to brace

3060
02:41:42,144 --> 02:41:44,192
Yourself

3061
02:41:44,704 --> 02:41:45,728
Freenote

3062
02:41:45,984 --> 02:41:47,520
Alpha Testing

3063
02:41:48,544 --> 02:41:50,592
Sure post Noah was debated

3064
02:41:52,128 --> 02:41:52,640
Jesus

3065
02:41:52,896 --> 02:41:55,712
Full on

3066
02:41:56,224 --> 02:41:57,248
Like that's what we're talkin

3067
02:41:57,504 --> 02:41:59,808
I don't know enough about software to

3068
02:42:01,600 --> 02:42:03,648
But I'll say yes

3069
02:42:04,160 --> 02:42:05,440
Working The Kinks out

3070
02:42:06,976 --> 02:42:09,024
Majid When you crush that ocean

3071
02:42:09,536 --> 02:42:10,560
Big storm

3072
02:42:11,584 --> 02:42:12,608
God's consciousness

3073
02:42:13,888 --> 02:42:15,680
Imagine before you go up the stairway

3074
02:42:16,192 --> 02:42:19,776
Are you come up out of that and you're like oh wow

3075
02:42:21,824 --> 02:42:23,104
Cars going to be sitting there

3076
02:42:23,360 --> 02:42:25,408
Show machine gun

3077
02:42:27,200 --> 02:42:27,968
Hair like

3078
02:42:29,504 --> 02:42:30,016
It's okay

3079
02:42:31,040 --> 02:42:33,088
It's it's all about to have

3080
02:42:33,856 --> 02:42:34,880
Everything's about to happen

3081
02:42:35,136 --> 02:42:36,928
God's waiting for you on the other side

3082
02:42:37,952 --> 02:42:39,232
But you have to say

3083
02:42:39,488 --> 02:42:40,512
Get behind me Satan

3084
02:42:42,816 --> 02:42:44,096
But you look at all these leftist week

3085
02:42:44,352 --> 02:42:44,864
Fun of them

3086
02:42:45,376 --> 02:42:46,144
Laugh

3087
02:42:46,400 --> 02:42:47,424
You cry about it but

3088
02:42:50,496 --> 02:42:51,520
The people that scare

3089
02:42:53,312 --> 02:42:55,104
They're people that point

3090
02:42:55,360 --> 02:42:56,640
Who was the fastest

3091
02:42:57,664 --> 02:42:58,176
What'd it now

3092
02:42:59,968 --> 02:43:02,272
Beta testing

3093
02:43:04,576 --> 02:43:05,344
You are Spirit

3094
02:43:08,416 --> 02:43:09,952
You are a piece of

3095
02:43:15,072 --> 02:43:16,608
Beautiful to hell

3096
02:43:18,400 --> 02:43:20,192
Horizons Dimensions to have

3097
02:43:23,264 --> 02:43:25,568
Kuro and just do things you can't imagine

3098
02:43:27,616 --> 02:43:28,896
I seen the other side

3099
02:43:30,432 --> 02:43:31,200
Dementia

3100
02:43:31,456 --> 02:43:32,992
It's amazing

3101
02:43:33,504 --> 02:43:34,016
What

3102
02:43:34,528 --> 02:43:37,344

3103
02:43:37,856 --> 02:43:44,000
Okay hold on hold the f****** phone what are you talkin about

3104
02:43:51,168 --> 02:43:54,496

I've been up there Consciousness it is fantastic but deadline

3107
02:44:07,296 --> 02:44:09,088
Even in his cosmology

3108
02:44:09,344 --> 02:44:13,952
God is going to ask you to fire a machine gun

3109
02:44:14,208 --> 02:44:15,232
God is God

3110
02:44:17,024 --> 02:44:18,304
You have like a

3111
02:44:18,560 --> 02:44:20,608
The heaven that would be Alex's heaven

3112
02:44:20,864 --> 02:44:27,008
Interdimensional

3113
02:44:27,264 --> 02:44:28,032
Machine gun for Alex

3114
02:44:31,616 --> 02:44:37,760
That makes total sense for you Alex

3115
02:44:40,832 --> 02:44:43,904
Multiple levels of consciousness

3116
02:44:44,160 --> 02:44:49,792
Very stressed

3117
02:44:50,816 --> 02:44:51,584
Kevin

3118
02:44:52,096 --> 02:44:54,912
Part for me I have walked past the golden

3119
02:45:01,312 --> 02:45:07,456
Exhausted

3120
02:45:09,504 --> 02:45:11,552
Evangelist

3121
02:45:11,808 --> 02:45:17,952
Like to tell you about the coming of the glory of God and how much of a headache

3122
02:45:18,208 --> 02:45:22,048
Weird

3123
02:45:23,584 --> 02:45:29,728
The shade of believability to it because of the human asp

3124
02:45:31,776 --> 02:45:33,824
He's going to wrap this up just got another Mini

3125
02:45:36,896 --> 02:45:38,176
So you want to share about

3126
02:45:38,432 --> 02:45:39,968
My television

3127
02:45:40,224 --> 02:45:42,784
Call Sharon August

3128
02:45:44,320 --> 02:45:47,136

3129
02:45:50,720 --> 02:45:53,280
Everybody said.

02:45:53,536 --> 02:45:54,048
What

3131
02:45:54,304 --> 02:45:57,120
Teacher.

3132
02:45:58,912 --> 02:46:00,448
You like a cup couch

3133
02:46:02,240 --> 02:46:04,799
You're not helping that means you're not the big

3134
02:46:12,991 --> 02:46:16,575
Built the world built the ships built the spaceship

3135
02:46:16,831 --> 02:46:17,343
Your couch

3136
02:46:17,599 --> 02:46:23,743
That's even more offensive version of what he always be out about Obama

3137
02:46:25,535 --> 02:46:26,815
You're just a couch

3138
02:46:27,071 --> 02:46:30,911
Nostalgia

3139
02:46:39,615 --> 02:46:40,639
But there's going to be a

3140
02:46:40,895 --> 02:46:41,663
Spreadable

3141
02:46:42,175 --> 02:46:42,943
Pressure

3142
02:46:43,455 --> 02:46:44,223
Going up that store

3143
02:46:46,271 --> 02:46:47,295
Paul Watson from England

3144
02:46:52,159 --> 02:46:53,695
I'm going to talk about

3145
02:46:58,815 --> 02:47:02,911
Appreciate this amazing crew

3146
02:47:03,167 --> 02:47:04,703
Because without you we are nothing

3147
02:47:05,215 --> 02:47:10,335
I salute you all I think Consciousness Free Will and God

3148
02:47:12,639 --> 02:47:13,151
I think

3149
02:47:13,407 --> 02:47:14,943
That they played money

3150
02:47:19,295 --> 02:47:19,807
Plug

3151
02:47:20,063 --> 02:47:22,111
You've been preaching for 9 minutes

3152
02:47:26,463 --> 02:47:32,607
I think Alex is too overwhelmed to heaven

3153
02:47:34,143 --> 02:47:37,215
Probably really misses Rodger I think there is a

3154
02:47:40,287 --> 02:47:41,823
Yeah Rodger is his dad

3155
02:47:43,359 --> 02:47:46,943
Where is Alex is Troy's dad

3156
02:47:47,199 --> 02:47:48,735
So Rodger has become Alex

3157
02:47:49,247 --> 02:47:51,039
Dad will think about what

3158
02:47:51,295 --> 02:47:52,319
Situation he was in

3159
02:47:53,599 --> 02:47:54,111
2050

3160
02:47:54,367 --> 02:47:56,415
In terms of being able to

3161
02:47:56,671 --> 02:48:00,255
The Rake in tons of Bonnie

3162
02:48:00,511 --> 02:48:02,303
Flare-ups when you want to try it

3163
02:48:02,815 --> 02:48:04,863
Like really go hard for PR

3164
02:48:05,119 --> 02:48:10,239
Mostly under his own control agency over the things that were happening to him

3165
02:48:10,495 --> 02:48:11,775
He was getting away with saying

3166
02:48:12,031 --> 02:48:14,079
Incredibly horrible things

3167
02:48:14,335 --> 02:48:14,847
Either f******

3168
02:48:15,103 --> 02:48:16,127
Clown who gives a s***

3169
02:48:16,895 --> 02:48:18,175
Rodger shows up in

3170
02:48:18,687 --> 02:48:21,503
Becoming the biggest Trump booster in the world

3171
02:48:21,759 --> 02:48:22,527
And a lot of

3172
02:48:24,319 --> 02:48:26,367
Quality control in terms of

3173
02:48:26,623 --> 02:48:27,135
He's home

3174
02:48:27,391 --> 02:48:31,231
Control Slipped Away Rogers narratives

3175
02:48:34,047 --> 02:48:35,071
So entirely

3176
02:48:35,327 --> 02:48:36,607
On the campaign

3177
02:48:36,863 --> 02:48:37,887
They lost their way

3178
02:48:40,703 --> 02:48:41,727
Astilbe the campaign

3179
02:48:43,007 --> 02:48:46,591
To do all of his rallies while he's president no turkey

3180
02:48:46,847 --> 02:48:48,383
I know Alex has to

3181
02:48:48,639 --> 02:48:49,151
Fights

3182
02:48:50,175 --> 02:48:50,687
Because it's a

3183
02:48:51,711 --> 02:48:54,527
Keep it as if there's some sort of

3184
02:48:54,783 --> 02:48:55,551
About to

3185
02:48:56,575 --> 02:48:57,599
Election was all about

3186
02:48:59,647 --> 02:49:00,415
Now that he's won

3187
02:49:02,975 --> 02:49:04,255
More without a fake villain

3188
02:49:04,767 --> 02:49:05,279
So

3189
02:49:05,791 --> 02:49:07,839
He has lost everything for Rodger

3190
02:49:08,351 --> 02:49:08,863
At least

3191
02:49:10,143 --> 02:49:11,935
I was going to say do you think

3192
02:49:13,215 --> 02:49:14,751
Even

3193
02:49:15,775 --> 02:49:16,543
Let's say he lives

3194
02:49:16,799 --> 02:49:17,311
275

3195
02:49:17,567 --> 02:49:18,591
Do you think at any point he

3196
02:49:18,847 --> 02:49:20,639
He's really going to wrestle

3197
02:49:20,895 --> 02:49:22,687
How much Rodger Stone

3198
02:49:23,199 --> 02:49:25,247
It does not go live 75

3199
02:49:25,503 --> 02:49:26,015
No that's true

3200
02:49:26,527 --> 02:49:27,295
And no no

3201
02:49:27,551 --> 02:49:32,415
Because

3202
02:49:32,671 --> 02:49:33,695
Is False Image

3203
02:49:35,231 --> 02:49:37,279
The masculinity that's wrapped in there

3204
02:49:37,535 --> 02:49:41,631
I don't think that there will ever come a point unless I could see situation

3205
02:49:41,887 --> 02:49:43,423
Who can you go to like

3206
02:49:43,679 --> 02:49:44,191
Deep recovery

3207
02:49:44,447 --> 02:49:47,775
Yeah baby go to AAA get involved in the process

3208
02:49:48,031 --> 02:49:53,151
Dramatic changes

3209
02:49:53,407 --> 02:49:55,455
Yeah and if he did something like that

3210
02:49:55,711 --> 02:49:56,479
Not necessarily

3211
02:50:04,415 --> 02:50:07,487
To be take that form a sort of like really

3212
02:50:07,743 --> 02:50:08,511
Intensive therapy

3213
02:50:09,023 --> 02:50:10,559
Like if you were able to

3214
02:50:10,815 --> 02:50:11,839
In that process

3215
02:50:12,351 --> 02:50:13,375
I think you could

3216
02:50:13,631 --> 02:50:14,911
Your version of Alex Jones

3217
02:50:15,167 --> 02:50:15,679
Could wrestle

3218
02:50:17,983 --> 02:50:18,751
He'll always make it

3219
02:50:19,007 --> 02:50:20,543
Excuses always rationalize

3220
02:50:23,103 --> 02:50:24,127
Further downward

3221
02:50:24,639 --> 02:50:25,407
Like I don't know

3222
02:50:30,271 --> 02:50:31,551
This document of this

3223
02:50:31,807 --> 02:50:32,319
Time because

3224
02:50:32,575 --> 02:50:33,087
You have

3225
02:50:33,855 --> 02:50:35,135
I was having a really great

3226
02:50:35,391 --> 02:50:36,415
Time demonizing

3227
02:50:38,207 --> 02:50:39,743
Really good cuz

3228
02:50:44,351 --> 02:50:45,631
I know I know some of those be

3229
02:50:45,887 --> 02:50:46,655
Victory lap

3230
02:50:46,911 --> 02:50:51,007
I can bring back that one man show couple years ago

3231
02:50:52,287 --> 02:50:52,799
So

3232
02:50:57,919 --> 02:50:58,431
I think

3233
02:50:58,943 --> 02:50:59,455
I think what a

3234
02:51:04,319 --> 02:51:05,599
B the Rodger thing

3235
02:51:06,623 --> 02:51:08,159
It didn't go the way you wanted it

3236
02:51:08,415 --> 02:51:09,183
That's one big

3237
02:51:10,975 --> 02:51:11,999
He's getting high on his own

3238
02:51:12,255 --> 02:51:12,767
Reply

3239
02:51:13,023 --> 02:51:14,047
Metaphor

3240
02:51:14,815 --> 02:51:16,351
Because videos

3241
02:51:16,607 --> 02:51:17,375
The Kaitlin Bennett

3242
02:51:17,631 --> 02:51:18,143
Put out

3243
02:51:18,399 --> 02:51:20,703
And the video that Owen Shroyer put out

3244
02:51:21,215 --> 02:51:22,239
Are not supposed to affect

3245
02:51:23,519 --> 02:51:24,031
They're not

3246
02:51:24,287 --> 02:51:26,591
They're supposed to affect the audience

3247
02:51:27,103 --> 02:51:27,871
Exam to Alex's

3248
02:51:28,895 --> 02:51:29,407
Would he walk

3249
02:51:29,919 --> 02:51:31,199
Videos

3250
02:51:31,711 --> 02:51:32,991
Was the mark

3251
02:51:33,759 --> 02:51:35,807
He's being viscerally affected

3252
02:51:36,063 --> 02:51:37,599
The propaganda

3253
02:51:38,111 --> 02:51:38,879
The prick everyone else

3254
02:51:39,647 --> 02:51:41,951
In the same way with Owens videos with the

3255
02:51:42,207 --> 02:51:42,719
People

3256
02:51:42,975 --> 02:51:45,791
Alta in San Antonio

3257
02:51:46,047 --> 02:51:47,839
Visceral

3258
02:51:48,095 --> 02:51:49,631
You can't be the propagandists

3259
02:51:49,887 --> 02:51:52,703
Under the sway of your own propaganda

3260
02:51:52,959 --> 02:51:55,007
A lot of attention

3261
02:51:55,263 --> 02:51:56,799
I feel that's coming

3262
02:51:57,567 --> 02:51:58,079
With his

3263
02:51:58,847 --> 02:52:00,383
The addition of booze

3264
02:52:02,943 --> 02:52:03,711
He's really

3265
02:52:04,479 --> 02:52:07,551
Yeah it's pretty bad also after this

3266
02:52:08,319 --> 02:52:09,343
After this episode ended

3267
02:52:09,855 --> 02:52:12,415
She goes to the Google headquarters in Austin

3268
02:52:12,927 --> 02:52:14,207
Because Steven Crowder

3269
02:52:14,463 --> 02:52:18,559
Was out doing one of his public spectacle

3270
02:52:20,095 --> 02:52:22,655
Beach doesn't exist

3271
02:52:22,911 --> 02:52:23,679
Where at

3272
02:52:24,191 --> 02:52:25,983
Alex and Owen Shroyer show up

3273
02:52:26,495 --> 02:52:28,287
And Owen Shroyer has a pretty

3274
02:52:28,543 --> 02:52:29,055
Conversation

3275
02:52:30,335 --> 02:52:30,847
Haha

3276
02:52:31,103 --> 02:52:32,639
Happy quotes

3277
02:52:34,175 --> 02:52:34,687
Not yelling

3278
02:52:34,943 --> 02:52:36,223
Conversation

3279
02:52:36,479 --> 02:52:39,039
I'm sitting at the table they become station about 8

3280
02:52:39,295 --> 02:52:39,807
Bajan

3281
02:52:40,063 --> 02:52:41,855
Whatever.

3282
02:52:42,111 --> 02:52:42,623
Between two people

3283
02:52:42,879 --> 02:52:43,647
They're both dumb

3284
02:52:43,903 --> 02:52:45,439
Yeah

3285
02:52:45,695 --> 02:52:46,207
Shows up

3286
02:52:46,719 --> 02:52:49,023
He's trying to make it all about himself

3287
02:52:49,279 --> 02:52:50,047
He's drunk

3288
02:52:50,303 --> 02:52:51,839
Trying to turn it into it

3289
02:52:53,375 --> 02:52:55,935
And you can tell that Steven Crowder is not super in

3290
02:52:56,447 --> 02:52:57,727
Yeah he's humoring him

3291
02:52:57,983 --> 02:52:59,007
To Annex

3292
02:52:59,263 --> 02:53:00,287
But also like

3293
02:53:00,543 --> 02:53:01,055
Trying to

3294
02:53:03,103 --> 02:53:04,895
And there's a real tension of like

3295
02:53:05,663 --> 02:53:06,175
Alright

3296
02:53:06,431 --> 02:53:07,455
I'm doing this

3297
02:53:07,711 --> 02:53:09,503
Because I just got demonetized

3298
02:53:10,015 --> 02:53:10,783
I'm trying to

3299
02:53:11,295 --> 02:53:12,319
The brand movie

3300
02:53:12,575 --> 02:53:14,879
I don't have time for you

3301
02:53:15,647 --> 02:53:17,183
Coming into making this about yourself

3302
02:53:18,207 --> 02:53:20,767
I think it's a Stein the even

3303
02:53:21,023 --> 02:53:21,791
The free speech

3304
02:53:22,047 --> 02:53:22,559
Bears aren't really a

3305
02:53:22,815 --> 02:53:23,839
Interested in what Alex is doing

3306
02:53:24,095 --> 02:53:25,119
And they view him

3307
02:53:25,375 --> 02:53:26,399
Too far

3308
02:53:26,911 --> 02:53:30,495
Sober and engaged in it as like

3309
02:53:30,751 --> 02:53:33,311
I am a part of your

3310
02:53:35,103 --> 02:53:37,151
But he showed up drunk

3311
02:53:37,407 --> 02:53:38,943
And was like

3312
02:53:41,759 --> 02:53:45,087
It's a it's a it's a bridge that'll probably never burn

3313
02:53:45,599 --> 02:53:46,111
Cuz

3314
02:53:46,367 --> 02:53:46,879
You know

3315
02:53:49,951 --> 02:53:50,463
Deteriorating

3316
02:53:50,719 --> 02:53:51,231
It's not as

3317
02:53:51,487 --> 02:53:52,255
Easy to cross any more

3318
02:53:52,511 --> 02:53:54,559
It's the same situation

3319
02:53:54,815 --> 02:53:56,607
10-4 Rodger

3320
02:53:57,119 --> 02:54:00,191
Way back when when he was on regularly when he would plug his

3321
02:54:00,447 --> 02:54:01,471
Legal defense fund

3322
02:54:01,983 --> 02:54:06,079
Immediately after just like you did on this episode and Alex

3323
02:54:07,103 --> 02:54:09,919
You know he didn't like somebody else getting the money that

3324
02:54:10,175 --> 02:54:10,687
Thought as his

3325
02:54:10,943 --> 02:54:13,759
Qatar doing that are Alex

3326
02:54:14,015 --> 02:54:14,783
Crowder makes perfect

3327
02:54:16,575 --> 02:54:19,647
Alex is offended when someone tries to piggyback hitch

3328
02:54:19,903 --> 02:54:22,719
Perfectly willing to piggyback

3329
02:54:24,255 --> 02:54:30,399
If you want to go watch a Crowder video whatever go for it but I didn't want to include any of it cuz it's just

3330
02:54:30,655 --> 02:54:31,679
Santa Clemente

3331
02:54:32,191 --> 02:54:33,215
A desperate the arse.

3332
02:54:33,471 --> 02:54:34,239
Cancel.

3333
02:54:35,519 --> 02:54:37,311
Next time they do one of those

3334
02:54:37,567 --> 02:54:39,103
Dumb tables we should go there

3335
02:54:39,615 --> 02:54:40,127
And you are owned

3336
02:54:41,407 --> 02:54:41,919
Where we setup

3337
02:54:42,943 --> 02:54:43,967
Timetable on the opposite

3338
02:54:44,223 --> 02:54:44,991
Decided

3339
02:54:45,247 --> 02:54:46,783
And put our little Banner on there that

3340
02:54:47,295 --> 02:54:47,807
Says f*** off

3341
02:54:49,087 --> 02:54:52,159
I don't know what I don't know

3342
02:54:52,671 --> 02:54:55,487
I like how you thinking but I don't want to do it

3343
02:54:57,791 --> 02:54:58,303
Interesting

3344
02:54:58,559 --> 02:55:01,119
Assume that by the time it's absurd comes out cuz recording this

3345
02:55:01,375 --> 02:55:02,143
Some Thursday during

3346
02:55:02,399 --> 02:55:02,911
The day

3347
02:55:03,167 --> 02:55:04,959
Real real come out Friday morning

3348
02:55:05,727 --> 02:55:07,775
I assume

3349
02:55:08,031 --> 02:55:08,799
Embarrassing

3350
02:55:09,055 --> 02:55:10,335
Feel like everytime

3351
02:55:10,847 --> 02:55:11,615
Where in the present

3352
02:55:11,871 --> 02:55:12,383
It's just like

3353
02:55:13,919 --> 02:55:16,223
Irrelevant does not look good now

3354
02:55:17,759 --> 02:55:18,271
But

3355
02:55:18,527 --> 02:55:19,039
You know

3356
02:55:19,807 --> 02:55:20,575
Stuff is dangerous

3357
02:55:21,087 --> 02:55:21,855
It's worth pointing out

3358
02:55:23,391 --> 02:55:23,903
There's that

3359
02:55:24,415 --> 02:55:26,719
It's really a bummer to find out that

3360
02:55:27,231 --> 02:55:28,255
The heaven my parents

3361
02:55:28,511 --> 02:55:29,023
Have told me if

3362
02:55:31,583 --> 02:55:32,095
Is going to be

3363
02:55:33,631 --> 02:55:34,143
Stressful

3364
02:55:34,399 --> 02:55:37,215
That sucks what's the point of having a f******

3365
02:55:37,471 --> 02:55:41,311
Can afterlife

3366
02:55:41,567 --> 02:55:47,711
I don't know it's a little bit of

3367
02:55:47,967 --> 02:55:51,039
Specifically

3368
02:55:51,295 --> 02:55:57,439
The devil honest it wasn't just the devil was part of the thing broke away is God is like let's get these people

3369
02:55:57,695 --> 02:56:03,839
Hang out with the devil to go get them

3370
02:56:04,095 --> 02:56:05,119
Gather

3371
02:56:05,375 --> 02:56:11,519
Backup

3372
02:56:14,335 --> 02:56:16,639
As I reflect

3373
02:56:16,895 --> 02:56:17,407
Tiny bit

3374
02:56:17,663 --> 02:56:18,175
I agree

3375
02:56:18,431 --> 02:56:19,967
His spirituality as a lot of

3376
02:56:22,527 --> 02:56:23,551
But more importantly

3377
02:56:24,063 --> 02:56:24,831
I think it's episodes

3378
02:56:25,087 --> 02:56:27,135
Is entirely worth it here Alex

3379
02:56:27,391 --> 02:56:27,903
3 *

3380
02:56:30,975 --> 02:56:33,791
So that is a great display of

3381
02:56:35,071 --> 02:56:36,351
Just a guy who's confident

3382
02:56:36,863 --> 02:56:37,887
Three Galleria

3383
02:56:38,399 --> 02:56:38,911
Yeah just

3384
02:56:39,167 --> 02:56:39,935
The guy who knows

3385
02:56:40,191 --> 02:56:41,983
What is what

3386
02:56:42,751 --> 02:56:43,519
Comfortable in his place

3387
02:56:44,799 --> 02:56:45,567
Straight-up relation

3388
02:56:46,847 --> 02:56:47,359
Just good

3389
02:56:48,127 --> 02:56:48,895
Just good

3390
02:56:49,919 --> 02:56:51,967
On Monday

3391
02:56:52,223 --> 02:56:54,271
