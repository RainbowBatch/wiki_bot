00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:16,032
No sense

13
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:23,456
The real irony of that is your ass

14
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:26,016
For a way to sum up the show

15
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,856
Bottom line is I know a lot about Alex Jones

16
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:33,184
You don't know anything about him

17
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,560

00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:40,864
Knowing a little bit about gravels is always a good idea

Are going to show up as we learned last

82
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:08,639
Because I have that Zoom recorder we should be able to get true whether or not

83
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:10,943
As amateurish as the last

84
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,503
Episode

85
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,063
It's listenable but

86
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,855
That last episode we did

87
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,391
When you listen to that recording

88
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:22,463
You pee standing up

89
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:29,887

114
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:34,143
Especially if you go to the shop so I decided

115
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,935
Ethan Hawke

116
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:39,007

00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:28,799
Daycare center

00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,623
Is weird

211
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,391
Bike week and a half

212
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:48,511

216
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:55,679

217
00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:00,287
Crazy cuz I got just before we started recording

218
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,823

219
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,127
#on Twitter

220
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,175
Found a body

221
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,991
The Patriots

222
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:11,551
Sylvester child rescue in the

223
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,879
What's the I don't know some other Facebook

224
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,927
No

225
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:23,327
It's 30 miles away from where they were originally

226
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,863
It's the wrong directions

227
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:25,631
Tucson

228
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:27,423
From where the

229
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:33,823
Mayor of Tucson is a Rothschild

230
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:43,551
Child family history of the universe

231
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:47,903
Incredible

232
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:54,815
Someone's going to get killed I'm not around this

233
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,607
But like the wavy things are a

234
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:57,375
Oscillating

235
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:00,959
From like a couple years ago and I was watching it with that daycare

236
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:04,287
But now we have this

237
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:07,615
Which is still evolving right now in terms of like what the

238
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,407
Where people are going to take

239
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:12,223
Fun narrative

240
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:16,319
Search qanon is that involved how much they can paint Vistas

241
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,343
Some sort of

242
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:18,623
The left wing

243
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:21,439
Jewish

244
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:28,351
When you want to make a big deal out of an unrelated person's name being Rothschild you're playing on archaic ABC

245
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:30,655
So

246
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,191
To say

247
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:34,751
I mean I don't know what to say cuz

248
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:35,775
If someone

249
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,567
If someone were listening to our show that does

250
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,335
Just believe that

251
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:39,871
View that it's stupid

252
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:43,199
I don't care to all I have to say is

253
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,223
Stripe it in

254
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:45,503
Cuz this is going to be happening

255
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,271
A lot

256
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,063
There's going to be a lot of this

257
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:51,135
It's going to be a mess everywhere

258
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:54,207
Calmer heads must Prevail I believe

259
00:14:55,487 --> 00:15:01,631
We got to go Bill Arizona

260
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:07,519
Something that I've been thinking about all f****** day

261
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:11,359
Cuz I rather have you read this New York Times article

262
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:16,223
About one of the children who is taken away from it was a Honduran child

263
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:17,247
Take it away from this

264
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,271
At the border

265
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:20,575
I did not and then just sent to a foster

266
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,343
Chester Hollman

267
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:22,623
Michigan

268
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:25,439
And it's just the entire story of the

269
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:29,023
And I thought about that all day today

270
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,583
Only thought I could have is

271
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,631
You know that thought process

272
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,167
Stuff like what would I do

273
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,703
In Nazi Germany

274
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:38,495
The Nazi

275
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:39,775
You came for

276
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,055
The Jews next door

277
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:43,615
You know that

278
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:46,175
If you cooperate with an ice agent

279
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,711
You would put a Jew in an oven

280
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:51,295
But that's the reality of it

281
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:57,695
You can do that you can answer that question for yourself

282
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,487
So

283
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:02,303
Don't pretend to be the hero ice agents are Nazis

284
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:06,143
If you if you are cooperating with them

285
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:11,775
Better you are right if that's who you are that's who you are

286
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:18,175
That somebody goes billares right what they found this like encampment right that had no debt

287
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:28,415
Enforcement did come and check it did have a cadaver dog going through

288
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,439
Child skull

289
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:34,047
This together and recognize that Ono the reason that

290
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,095
That like

291
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:40,191
It looked like there were underground tunnels when there weren't is like why is it so hard to

292
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,471
Define the place that

293
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:47,871
These people are supposed to be in

294
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:51,199
Serbia child skull in the middle of the desert I don't know maybe hiding

295
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:54,271
Maybe maybe they're a bunch of people in militias

296
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,039
The go out

297
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:58,623
And like knock over bottles of water that are left out for

298
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:03,231
For immigrants that crossed the border maybe they died because of the

299
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:06,559
My baby

300
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:12,959
So do I think about all that

301
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,775
The Backyard Brawl

302
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:22,175
But it did waste a good hour of my day

303
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:24,735
I did like that there's like

304
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,015
They're f******

305
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:28,319
These people can't get their shift

306
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:30,879
Cuz they're like turning on each other now there's like

307
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:33,183
Some of these Baga accounts are like

308
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:39,583
They're pissed off about how Jack pasovic is covering it in their life

309
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:46,239
Enjoy

310
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:49,567
It's like you had you created your monster and I'll deal with it

311
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:55,711
Goodnight

312
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:58,271
Bill Ayers on

313
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:00,063
This is

314
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:02,111
I have no idea

315
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:06,719
Couple times edit

316
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:07,999
It's really confusing

317
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:10,815
Cuz you walk away with a couple of conclusion

318
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:13,119
Right there one of those Alex is terrible at his job

319
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:20,543
But he thinks it does he thinks he does he has a picture in his head like

320
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:27,199
Arch leftist terrorist

321
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:33,087
And that's going to be a problem Ira members that would be sinking

322
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:34,623
Like

323
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:41,023
I don't know how to depict it other than I think he thinks he's like

324
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:45,631
A guy who's running around throwing bombs that have like pictures of Lenin.

325
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,959
I think that's a fun supervillain

326
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:52,287
We're going to ride our knowledge by comic book

327
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,335
Probably will happen

328
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,359
Probably not

329
00:18:55,615 --> 00:19:01,759
Call Alex

330
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:06,111
Conveniently doesn't understand that bombs would that explode the picture

331
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,135
Right

332
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,671
Also doesn't understand that

333
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:10,719
For that

334
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:11,487
Child

335
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:13,023
The skull of

336
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,559
Arizona

337
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:16,863
Have to be related to that crime

338
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,655
Describe

339
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:22,751
You'd have to include

340
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:23,519
Pyridium

341
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,079
Part of the crime scene

342
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:33,247
It's a crime my buddy

Real drunk

346
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,159
Went to Juarez

347
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:42,463
That's an interesting

348
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,351
I went to a lot of Bordertown

349
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:53,215
Anyway

350
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:59,359
A lot of Bordertown

351
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:03,455
To say I like it I don't know why it tickles me so but it does

352
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,223
You got to go

353
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:05,503
You buy pills

354
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:09,599
We were going to do

355
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:15,999
You just always thought we were going to buy prescription in Mexico so you go down to Mexico You by Pillsbury

356
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:18,303
You're back you're white than I going to check you when you cross the border

Great time

360
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,103
Blog

361
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:33,663
Let's get to the Cypress cliff

362
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:43,647
We were we went along with the band

363
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:45,183
Opso

364
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:47,743
In this first clip Alex's starting off

365
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,071
Getting to his head

366
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:55,423
But one of the things

367
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,191
Does gears

368
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:57,983
We started to

369
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:00,287
Not started to notice

370
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,311
But started to discuss

371
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,103
This is a really shity

372
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:04,383
Trout

373
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:06,175
Where he assumed

374
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:07,199
Conclusion

375
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:08,735
These straps off

376
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:10,783
Before the interview even starts

377
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,319
He wants to make sure that

378
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:14,623
You know how this is going to end

384
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:49,184
Normalcy bias

Physically

390
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:11,968
Thinking about Billerica

391
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,344
I just know it

392
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:24,256
So there is the first dance

393
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,536
Distance of it that is

394
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:26,816
The first diet well-liked

395
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,608
Sono Bello

396
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:30,400
And no matter what he says

397
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:37,312
You already know I've made that conclusion if he says yes

398
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,664
Also what kind of is it would be like

399
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:46,016
You're working for the mega-rich trying to destroy us all and Bill is like

400
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:49,856
Yeah totally you got me

401
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:50,880
Also

402
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:54,720
Who was the mega-rich

403
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,512
About specific

404
00:22:56,768 --> 00:23:01,888
So you can't have a Flashpoint

405
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:02,656
The can't happen

406
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:03,680
Concurrently

407
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:04,704
What's up dumb f***

408
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,520
You're listening you're listening to

409
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:11,872
Consciousness of the universe

00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:14,688
He can say whatever he damn well pleases in that sentence

411
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:16,736
With a masterpiece

412
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:19,808
Alright

413
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:23,392
Obama on Obamacare

414
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:27,488
Another tattoo

415
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:42,848
America

416
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:45,920
Grass wall

417
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:47,456

Weather Underground

420
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:57,440
Confidant former leader of the Weather Underground

Blogspot.com

425
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:13,312
Let's go to a clip of a man speaking from the grave

426
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:20,224
They also believe that responsibility

427
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,760
Octopus counter-revolution

428
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:23,296
Best B

429
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:24,576
Guarded against

430
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:31,488
By creating and establishing

431
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:34,304
Educated

432
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,120
And teach them how things were going to be

433
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:50,944
And when I put 25 million people

434
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:57,600
Soleri grass wall is

435
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:59,136

00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:11,680
Okay go to vomit Alex was just speaking.

00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:17,312
Former FBI informant who quoted Obama

440
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:21,408
By giving Obama cloud is a terrible spy

441
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:22,944
Hi Alex

442
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:29,600
It's important

443
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:31,648

Timeline

446
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,280
And his character

447
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,048
Relation of things

448
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:40,096
We challenged ever since

449
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:41,376
Came out Road

450
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:42,144
Facebook

451
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:42,912
Believers in 90

76

453
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,472
About

454
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:47,264
Infiltrating Weather Underground

455
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,872
Right people who were involved i e Bill Ayers and Bernadette Doran

456
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:53,664
This is bulshit

457
00:25:53,920 --> 00:26:00,064
Also

458
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,112
Background when you can like when you look at the

459
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:04,416
Nothing to say that like veterans

460
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,184
Maryville

461
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,256
But someone who is a Vietnam vet

462
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:09,536
Who is part like a

463
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:12,608
Super decorated

464
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:13,888
Loves the army

465
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:14,912
I can't like

466
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:18,240
His website is Larry Grant Wahl 101st

467
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:23,104
In honor of the hundred and first Airborne he's a part of Shrek

468
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:25,920
Idea of him infiltrating

469
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:28,992
Anti-vietnam War group

470
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,784
Probably going to be like

471
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,064
I've got to look makeup looks

472
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,928
Pretty bad possible

473
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:38,720
Clearly the thing I am again

474
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:41,024
They don't respect the work that I've done

475
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,328
Whatever

476
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:46,400
People for no reason so I don't I don't

477
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:49,728
I've looked into him a bit

478
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:51,008
Because they were killing

479
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:56,384
Violence and chaos.

480
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,664
For a reason

481
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,992
And he couldn't process the fact that all of the s*** he did

482
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:02,272
Look for nothing

483
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:04,320
I've looked into him a bit

484
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:05,344
It's tough to find

485
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,112
Too much

486
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:07,136
Specifics about him and

487
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:12,768
They were up to

488
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:15,840
He's a little bit more difficult because it was in the seven

489
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:18,144
As good of a record at

490
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:20,960
Please Dad everybody was informing

491
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:23,520
Infowars

492
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:27,616
And his daughter is appeared on Infowars

493
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:28,640
I'm going to say I don't

494
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:35,808
I don't trust

495
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:40,928
Highway 280

496
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,976
So Alex still has been

497
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,352
It's really

498
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,984
In the first Clipper we heard he's setting the table for failure

499
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:56,800
Are you setting the table to make it okay once he loses the dark

500
00:27:57,056 --> 00:28:00,640
In this next clip use setting the table for everyone to like fields

501
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:01,408
Threatened

502
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,432
I also

503
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:05,248
If you heard

504
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:06,016
He said

505
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:08,064
Do they have to worry about

506
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:08,832
These

507
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:11,136
These folks is the counter-revolution

508
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,672
Alex

509
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:14,464
Clearly believe that

510
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:19,072
Is the counter-revolution

511
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:20,864
To the marxist-leninist

512
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,960
Whatever.

513
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:26,240
Is part of the

514
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:28,544
This clip that requires little

515
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,592
Personal to him

516
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:35,456
I have been in a run

517
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:41,600

519
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:49,792

Be advised

Revised

526
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:24,352
He has to be listening that's right

527
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,800
That we know what's going on

528
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:36,640

That's interesting

574
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:44,384
I don't know

575
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:46,176
I'm doing a lot of research

576
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:50,784
I have man

577
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:52,576
It's pretty crazy

578
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:56,160
So what is a fascist world government with

579
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,440
Communists under it

580
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:07,424
Hierarchy

581
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:15,360
I mean like

582
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:18,688
Pyramid

583
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:20,224
Oils and sugars

584
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,016
Stop

585
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:26,880
You need the least of the graves of the Communists on the bottom right

586
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:33,280
And also vegetables of Compton

587
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:35,840
Socialist

588
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:37,888
We're like fake socialist

589
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,472
No notice capitalists don't actually exist

590
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,776
What caplets are really just passed

591
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:45,568
Socialist

592
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:49,408
World's socialist difference

593
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:52,736
Pyramid of ideologies

594
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,016
Socialist

595
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:56,832
When were talking about this like the world DVDs espousing is

596
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,392
You can boil it down if you want to get released

597
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:02,976
Powers-that-be

598
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:04,768
Encourage socialism

599
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:08,864
Acceptable lashing out at

600
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:10,912
Right because they

601
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:12,192
Secretly wanted

602
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:13,728
Create Monopoly

603
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:14,752
Control of stuff

604
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:19,104
You have socialism

605
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:19,872
I like

606
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:22,688
Judas goats who are leading people

607
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:23,456
Victor

608
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:24,480
Something that we're all like

609
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:25,504
And you're going to get some

610
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:32,672
He's leading you down this path

611
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:38,048
The promises of free healthcare and what have you

612
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:43,680
You take her eyes off the prize for a second what do you know you

613
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:44,704
You're trapped in communist

614
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,288
And it all works

615
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:50,848
Corporate

616
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:57,248
Monopolist because all of the

617
00:33:57,504 --> 00:34:01,600
People who thought socialism was couple monopolies over everything

618
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:06,464
So you figured it out put it on the system is already

619
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:12,096
I meant the government and nonsensical fantasy

620
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:13,888
And if so needless

621
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:21,312
Capitalism works really

622
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:26,432
Pretty crazy

623
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:30,784
If you really take apart capitalism as it is

624
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,088
You get little chunks of each of these days

625
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:36,928
And so you pretend that all of these things are completely separate from each other

626
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:42,304
What holidays you're really railing against is the capitalist system that you profess to love so much

627
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,328
Right right

628
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,376
The other the other thing

629
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,424
That I think is fun

630
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,960
Is that because

631
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:50,240
Ben

632
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:51,008
Spending

633
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:51,776
What time

634
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:52,800
In this

635
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:53,568
In this world

636
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,384
I can tell you definitively

637
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,688
Gary Allan

638
00:34:58,944 --> 00:34:59,456
Stupid

639
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:01,504
The guy who wrote

640
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,552
The guy who wrote none dare

641
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:04,832
None dare call it

642
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:05,856
Conspiracy is

643
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:06,880
Really dumb

644
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:08,672
Like legitimately

645
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:13,280
There is can't believe it has no reason to think that this guy

646
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,096
2 proof Dan I will

647
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:18,144
I will I'll give you a couple pieces of proof

648
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,240
If you want peace of proof Trump

649
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,776
History or a preacher

650
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,336
Let's go with the preacher

651
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:27,360
So

652
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:31,712
I've never had to ask myself

653
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:33,760
This is the visit

654
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:34,784
Belittle used

655
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,088
It's actually like he's manipulative lie lying

656
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:37,856
About stuff

657
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:42,976
It's smart to manipulative lie lie about

658
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:44,256
Alright

659
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:46,560
You want to do something stupid

660
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:48,096
I want full on

661
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:50,144
Unmitigated stupidity

662
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,936
I want him to

663
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:55,520
I want to have him walk underneath

664
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:58,848
Bucket of water that

665
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,896
Magic is at just falls on top of

666
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:06,528
We'll just for fun because people might be.

667
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:08,064
None dare call it conspiracy

668
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:12,160
Father Pedro arrupe

669
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:15,488
C5 right he takes this

670
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:17,024
Completely out of context

671
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,816
Indicate the guy was talking about

672
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:19,840
The communist

673
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:21,120
Conspiracy of the elite

674
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:24,192
Confined that speech online and

675
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:25,472
And I have

676
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:28,800
Catholicism needs better marketing

677
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:30,336
Atheism

678
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:31,104
That's all

679
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:34,688
Wildly autocorrect

680
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:41,600
Wish you could in 1972 and a twelve-year-old Alex Jones would never be able to find the full speech

681
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:45,696
Right there driving you might accidentally

682
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:46,720
Yeah

683
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:48,768
That didn't exist

684
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:50,816
Form is it did

685
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:55,168
The first chapter of their college

686
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:56,192
A

687
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:56,960
It was called

688
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:57,984
Confuse me with facts

689
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:02,336
And then the last chapter

690
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:05,664
Dakota

691
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,736
The Layla piano outro Eric Clapton

692
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:10,016
Gotcha

693
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,696
Is him trying to make his argument

694
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:20,256
Except

695
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:21,536
Hughes view of the world

696
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:24,352
Which is crazy is crazy

697
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:25,888
Psychological Issaquah

698
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:26,656
From page 10

699
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:30,752
Psychological problems are also involved and people to look at the evidence

700
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:32,288
Insiders

701
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:33,568
Which is what he calls the globalist

702
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:37,152
People are usually comfortable with their old beliefs

703
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:37,920
Conception

704
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:40,992
When Columbus told people the world was a ball and not a pan

705
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:47,392
They were highly upset thinking of a lifetime

706
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:53,792
Outlook

707
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:08,384
Intellectuals of the timer like

708
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,504
Where in electrical

709
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:17,856
Even if mix

710
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:21,952
Level stupid

711
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:25,792
Stupid

712
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:26,816
6230

713
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:33,728
You know where

714
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:34,752
If you look

715
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:36,544
You if you look at those chips

716
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,080
Sailed over the ocean

717
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:42,944
It doesn't just fall

718
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,504
Couple of them

719
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,552
The reason that he was butting heads

720
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:48,832
People at the time was

721
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:54,976
The world

722
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,584
So do you know where the idea that Gary Allan

723
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:03,424
Working off of comes from the idea that there was some sort of

724
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,448
Tension between Christopher

725
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:08,288
Columbus on the intelligent Elites of 9

726
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:14,688
No understanding

727
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:15,968
Richest people of the time

728
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:22,368
And it wasn't about the addictive

729
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:28,768
Is also about heliocentrism it was about whether or not the Earth revolves around the Sun or the sun around the Earth

730
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:35,168
Watch

731
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:39,264
House arrest because he was a dick

732
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,824
Patron was in the Catholic Church

733
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:45,920
Eddie rode all of these letters in and then put it out this book like

734
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:52,320
I was he knows I was just trying to give

735
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:54,368
A possible way you

736
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:56,416
You could be yeah I got you

737
00:39:56,928 --> 00:40:01,792
Columbus was

738
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:05,376
But also

739
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:06,400
I'd look

740
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:07,936
Just f***

741
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:12,800
Christopher Columbus

742
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:13,824
Being at odds with

743
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:15,104
Intellectuals of

744
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,128
What's the time

745
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,920
It comes directly

746
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:19,456
Plot

747
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:22,272
Of the 1828 book The Life and Voyages of

748
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:23,808
For Columbus

749
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:24,832
That was written

750
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:25,600
Bye

751
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:26,880
Washington Irving

752
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:33,280
I was about to if you say it was the same guy I was going to

753
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:36,608
Was most famous for having written

754
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:37,888
Rip Van Winkle

755
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,936
And The Legend of Sleepy Hollow

756
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:41,984
Great books you wrote a fictitious

757
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:45,312
History of Christopher Columbus and the time

758
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:46,592
Gary Allan

759
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:49,920
Who wrote none dare call it conspiracy is using it

760
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:51,456
As the centerpiece

761
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:56,832
Of his first chapter

762
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:57,856
In this next Passage

763
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:59,392
Also about the same

764
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:01,184
Right after the one I just read

765
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,488
And the typical flat-earthers

766
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:04,768
Headset

767
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:06,560
Interest involved in their own egos

768
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:11,424
Abuse on Columbus for challenging their view of the universe

769
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,448
Who don't

770
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:13,472
Confused

771
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:15,520
Our minds are made up of they said

772
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:16,288
What's

773
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:21,152
He took the name of his first chapter legitimately from

774
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:22,176
Him not knowing

775
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:26,272
About history and taking it all from a Washington Irving

776
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:29,344
Fictional

777
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:35,744
So that's the kind of book we're dealing with that Alex is being like a pretty productive socialism going to take over

778
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:42,144
This is a guy who's riding a believe that the man in the High Castle

779
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:47,008
Castle Israel like he's writing now about our history is like a castle

780
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,848
Time travel is possible in there are multiple dimensions

781
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:56,735
And that's why

782
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:58,783
Dimensional

783
00:41:59,039 --> 00:41:59,807
That's the trick

784
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:02,879
I want to put too fine a point

785
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:03,647
Time travel

786
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:06,719
Dementia

787
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:15,935
That's the kind of book we're dealing with when we talk about Gary Allan's none dare

788
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:17,727
NADA book

789
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:22,335
Like you know how in endgame we were going through it there all the victors

790
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:23,871
Quotes that were made up

791
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:28,479
He makes up quotes

792
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:29,759
There's just

793
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:30,783
So much s***

794
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:32,575
Crazy how bad this book

795
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:39,743
Why not

796
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:44,095
So now we're

797
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:48,959
Minutes into the intro of Bill Ayers

798
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:53,567
Still have not heard from him

799
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:56,127
Chris 43 put yet so

800
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:57,663
I know now that this

801
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:59,455
This is really shity of me to have named

802
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:00,223
This clip Alex

803
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:01,247
How to do brief

804
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:03,039
Freaking froze because

805
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:10,719
Might be a pot Kettle situation but anyway

806
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:17,375
Ladies and gentlemen we are an hour of this worldwide broadcast

807
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:21,983
Joining a sheer on the 20th

Democracy in education

814

The cultural context of schooling

815
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:59,359
Has an essential intellectual ethical and political

816
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:02,431
He is a former vice-president of the curriculum division

Is just let him

00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:23,935
Have the floor the first three 45 minutes

820
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:29,823
This is way of saying like

821
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:32,895
I didn't ask for that I didn't know this was going to happen

822
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:38,527
This is going to I'm preemptively letting you know one how I hope this ends

823
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:44,927
That whatever it is he says is a lie because if I don't let you know that

824
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:49,535
You're going to watch me get my ass kicked and all the floor

825
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:50,559

826
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:52,095
Scholarship and should our kind of

827
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:53,119
To be mocked

828
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:57,727
He was reading that resume in your life

829
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:03,103
S*** that dude got a resume and then you go back and look at other Infowars gases like

830
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:08,223
He is the captain of the happyfun ship boat

Anti-communist trivia we've got a guy who will sell you a postcard with all the words

00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:25,375
To never get arrested

835
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:27,935
All you need to know is that Alex would have f******

836
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:29,215
Gary Allan on every

837
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:32,031

I am so amused

844
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:57,119
Socialist leader they thought would come or

845
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:58,911
Or will that be another

846
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:03,007
Weather

00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:04,799
I want under Steeler

848
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:08,127
Bill Ayers George loss of asking about

849
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:09,407
Larry Graham

850
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:16,575
Progressive

851
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:18,367
Thank you so much

852
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:21,695

Thank you very much

854
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:27,071
That is built

855
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:30,655
Boy he's there

856
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:31,935
He just learned he just

857
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:33,215
Intro

858
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:37,567
I would leave earlier and then still be like

859
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:41,407
Well it's fucken do this

860
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:44,479
And also there's a bunch of points where

861
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:45,759
Alex has his mic

862
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:46,783
Way down

863
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:51,647
We can talk over if Mike is clearly turned off or are you staying

864
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:58,047
That's not fair

865
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:00,095
Is Mike is off and he's just laughing

866
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:06,751
Like a clearly he's just like what are we doing cuz not know who Alex Jones is

867
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:08,031
That should be

868
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:10,335
Now that's what makes this fun

869
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:15,455
Neither of them really know what the f*** is going on right now what

870
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:19,039
One of them should have responsibilities to know cuz it's his show

871
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:20,063
The other one

872
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:23,647
Accuses

873
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:25,439
J'accuse

874
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:29,023
Build-A-Bear

875
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:30,303
And this isn't

876
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:33,631
Then let me just start with Tommy

877
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:35,167
Brickshelf because

878
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:37,727
Most communist Center socialist

879
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:44,127
Person

880
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:48,223
Do you endorse the type of communism

881
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:52,063
Russia and China

882
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:23,551
Global democracy and democracy

883
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:24,575
Right now

884
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:25,343
This isn't over

885
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:27,647
You can see it Alex

886
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:30,463
I got to make sure I don't let him talk

887
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:33,535
Yeah yeah yeah

888
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:49,663
Equation of God

889
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:53,503
In terms of the government libertarian

890
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:03,743
I believe that we need more democracy

891
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:08,607
In any democracy the solution to our problem

892
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:17,567
Let's come at it from this angle do you change your house your views changed since you are one of the

893
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:22,431
Weather Underground

894
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:27,807
Shakira

895
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:35,487
Way to present yourself when you're the host of a show

896
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:36,767
Like you just like

897
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:38,047
You let this guy

898
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:39,839
A very

899
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:44,191
I know that you're calling me communist but realistic

900
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:44,959
Sick leave

901
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:47,007
Much more complicated than that

902
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:49,823
Different facets to my philosophical

903
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:51,871
Long pause

904
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:56,735
Have you go somewhere else

905
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:00,575
I would prefer.

906
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:04,671
For Alex

907
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:05,695
What are the things that

908
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:07,231
Asmus goes along

909
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:16,703
Bill are singing bunch of s*** that Alex realized

910
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:17,727
I hate this guy

911
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:19,519
I have to set him up

912
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:25,663
Yep he was a terrorist who is trying to check

913
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:28,479
About it

914
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:30,271
But in principle in terms of

915
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:31,039
The real world

916
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:34,623
Well what what Alex just

917
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:35,647
Heard was

918
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:38,975
I accidentally said

919
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:42,047
Fairly similar

920
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:42,815
Because

921
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:45,631
I think that

922
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:48,703
A lot of the good principles that Alex

923
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:50,239
Pretends to believe in

924
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:55,615
Bill Ayers believes was a definition

925
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:58,687
Of what you could call a classical liberal

926
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:01,503
Here's that

927
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:03,551
He has to be like

928
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:05,343
Can't allow that

929
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:06,111
How much are beds

930
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:11,743
I mean no I'm not a I'm not saying that it's a perfect

931
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:15,071
Comparison I'm just saying that all of the stuff he described

932
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:17,631
Alex wants to co-op

933
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:21,727
And imagine that he is the is the description of those

934
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:25,823
Actually lives

935
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:28,639
And he's a f****** fraud who actually is a

936
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:30,175
Conservatives fascist ask

937
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:34,015
Still have

938
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:36,063
Dropping

939
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:39,391
You still got a conservative

940
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:47,327
Because

941
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:50,911
Some of the exchanges that they have are not to be believed

942
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:55,775
Text Chunk

943
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:56,799
Resigned

944
00:51:58,847 --> 00:51:59,615
Coming together

945
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:02,175
And what Bill Ayers would call

946
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:10,879
Let's come at it from this angle

947
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:14,975
Weather Underground versus 2015

948
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:16,255
Well I mean

949
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:44,159
Catastrophic

950
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:48,767
We should

951
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:54,399
So you don't

952
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:12,319
Unfortunately

953
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:15,135
You got John McCain completely mainly Elena Chang

954
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:23,327
Because I think we should call

955
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:39,199
I think we should become a nation among nations

956
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:46,879
What is your view of

957
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:48,671
Barack Obama then

958
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:57,375
I did not edit them I did not edit this

959
00:53:57,887 --> 00:54:03,775
Splice that to be like through that

960
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:05,823
He can't real but that because

961
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:07,359
S***

962
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:10,687
I am in favor of those things

963
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:14,783
Or at least I am supposedly

964
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:17,599
Put all the Sonic also I'm

965
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:18,367
Supposed to

966
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:19,391
I hate Bill Ayers

967
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:20,671
Post

968
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:26,303
Yeah

969
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:27,327
You're not black

970
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:31,935
Come on man

971
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:38,335
What are we doing Disney rake

972
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:39,359
That's the idea

973
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:43,199
Like he's really screaming he's really lashing out Obama

974
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:44,479
Through Bellaire

975
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:47,807
Somewhat

976
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:53,439
Billares is it that Obama is

977
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:54,207
VSCO

978
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:56,511
Need to know if you had

979
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:57,279
Any

980
00:54:57,535 --> 00:54:59,071
Interest in Bel Airs before the

981
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:00,351
0

982
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:02,655
0%

983
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:05,471
0%

984
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:09,055
Caribou

985
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:10,079
Focus look like

986
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:12,127
Fears about cultural Marxism

987
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:13,919
And stuff like that was part of the John Birch

988
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:14,943
Society

989
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:16,479
That's the world that Alexandra

990
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:19,551
Come from so I can

991
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:21,855
I could see him being a name that Alex was

992
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:22,623
Aware of

993
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:23,647
How many p

994
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:24,415
People work

995
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:28,767
Even aware of Billiards. Before Fox News

996
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:30,559
Add him being associated with

997
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:31,583
Obama

998
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:34,399
You can't imagine that Alex

999
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:35,423
Research

1000
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:37,727
I think I was I knew bellairs was

1001
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:40,543
One of my friends not growing up but

1002
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:41,823
College with Kyler

1003
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:54,367
Something about him bombing all the time joke

1004
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:58,207
Which is good for a roast

1005
00:55:58,463 --> 00:56:00,767
My first year of Comedy certain way

1006
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:01,535
I'll take a medium

1007
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:04,351
I'm so we get there at the end of the clip

1008
00:56:04,607 --> 00:56:08,447
We see we hear a mascot out of adolescent

1009
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:09,983
What do you think

1010
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:11,775
Let's find out what

1011
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:12,543
Think about Obama

1012
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:14,335
Alex would assume that it's

1013
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:16,383
I love the gyno and this is

1014
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:21,247
At the end of Obama's tenure so billares as watched all of those things

1015
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:23,295
He just described that he didn't want

1016
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:25,087
PD expanded by Obama

1017
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:25,855
Well

1018
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:28,671
What is your view of

1019
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:29,951
Morocco

1020
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:33,279
Barack Obama

1021
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:58,623
What do you think

1022
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:08,351
Community College

1023
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:19,871
Pragmatic politician

1024
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:26,783
You can examine

1025
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:30,111
Bill Millers

1026
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:31,647
Very good tactics

1027
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:33,951
About getting a

1028
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:36,255
Village

1029
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:40,351
With the village Elders have

1030
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:43,167
Common ground

1031
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:46,239
I understand that but you're not

1032
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:48,031
You fight for

1033
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:51,103
Oh boy

1034
00:57:54,687 --> 00:58:00,831
Maybe two minutes into them talkin heard Bill Ayers say a bunch of stuff

1035
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:03,647
Andy realizes I cannot let this man

1036
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:05,951
Anymore I must attack

1037
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:09,023
I have to attack and from here on out

1038
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:10,559
We are just going to

1039
00:58:10,815 --> 00:58:11,839
People

1040
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:14,143
A bad time

1041
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:15,935
Rikers Island

1042
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:16,959
Got to be a dick

1043
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:19,775
Alex

1044
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:20,799
This is a

1045
00:58:21,055 --> 00:58:22,335
This is a smart move on

1046
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:23,359
Undoubtedly

1047
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:25,407
This is the this is how Batman

1048
00:58:25,663 --> 00:58:26,175
Smart move

1049
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:27,711
Difficult

1050
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:29,759
Turn off the f****** line

1051
00:58:30,271 --> 00:58:31,295
Put it on robtwo

1052
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:37,695

1054
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:47,423
Committed to doing this

1055
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:52,287
Interview what you have to do really well right there is

1056
00:58:55,103 --> 00:58:56,895
You're lying about everything

1057
00:58:57,151 --> 00:59:02,015
Who is older also characterized the idea of us

1058
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:04,319
Agreeing on something as being a

1059
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:05,599
Evil attack

1060
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:14,559
No that's alright

1061
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:16,607
What's the point of even talking

1062
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:18,655
Well we're never going to agree on it

1063
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:22,239
Confusion

1064
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:24,543
I hope you can do that cuz

1065
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:25,823
To be his game

1066
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:26,847
Just trying to

1067
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:27,615
Keep Bel-Airs

1068
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:28,383
Confused

1069
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:30,175
Praying it works for

1070
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:33,759
So I know he's really ugly

1071
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:36,575
Fillers

1072
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:38,111
PetSmart

1073
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:39,135
Alex

1074
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:40,159
Dump

1075
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:42,463
606

1076
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:46,047
The powers of the

1077
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:47,071
To fight against

1078
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:49,119
PetSmart which is yelling

1079
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:54,495
Saying confused

1080
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:55,263
Right

1081
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:56,543
I know we

1082
00:59:59,359 --> 00:59:59,871
But how that is

1083
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:00,639
Now Appliance

1084
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:01,663
Twitter

1085
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:06,015
Backyard brawls

1086
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:07,551
All they're doing is yelling

1087
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:09,599
Old

1088
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:11,135
I'm so Alex wanted

1089
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:12,671
You asking that last

1090
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:13,439
Who funds

1091
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:15,999
Is his way of

1092
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:19,071
The following up on what he said before he has you where he's like

1093
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:20,351
He's going to come in and

1094
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:23,167
Pretend that he doesn't die all the mega-rich

1095
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:24,959
So here's where this goes this is

1096
01:00:25,215 --> 01:00:26,239
Like this

1097
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:28,031
Is nuts

1098
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:36,479
From those guys

1099
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:47,999
Retired professors I'm not sure

1100
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:50,047
Define Liberation theology

1101
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:53,375
That I know you're fully aware of the University campuses

1102
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:15,135
Is he

1103
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:21,535
Are you excited about geology

1104
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:45,599
Taxes for George Soros

1105
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:52,767
Roosevelt

1106
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:58,655
Real place on Pulaski

1107
01:01:59,167 --> 01:02:00,959
Revealing that you

1108
01:02:01,215 --> 01:02:03,519
Like what you just said whatever he's at

1109
01:02:03,775 --> 01:02:06,847
You don't know who I am is it him being like

1110
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:09,663
I have a paranoid background

1111
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:11,711
I'm a paranoid

1112
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:16,831
You saw through me immediately

1113
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:21,439
Admission that like

1114
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:24,255
Started my work

1115
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:27,327
What is instantly

1116
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:30,655
Also Alex is pissed off that use the word

1117
01:02:30,911 --> 01:02:32,447
Because he doesn't understand that work

1118
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:33,983
Which is

1119
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:34,751
Giggled

1120
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:44,223
Chinese government

1121
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:46,271
The CIA says 60

1122
01:02:46,527 --> 01:02:49,087
Are you sure

1123
01:02:55,743 --> 01:02:59,583
Nothing about you

1124
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:11,615
No no

1125
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:12,383
Deliberation

1126
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:20,575
Is a connection that he's implying

1127
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:21,855
Between George Soros and the pub

1128
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:24,671
So him saying I didn't say that absolutely not true

1129
01:03:25,695 --> 01:03:29,535
I was about to get into asking you about George Soros

1130
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:31,327
Geology

1131
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:42,335
I don't know much about Liberation theology

1132
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:44,383
Organizing stirring up

1133
01:03:44,895 --> 01:03:48,991
Liberation theology

1134
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:52,575
I love you

1135
01:03:58,719 --> 01:04:01,535
Talking about

1136
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:02,559
I am a professor

1137
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:06,399
Professor

1138
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:07,423
Now the witch

1139
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:08,703
Center on

1140
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:09,727
Ideas

1141
01:04:09,983 --> 01:04:14,847
Wherein we communicate regarding those we stay focused on the top

1142
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:17,407
Using that topic we then

1143
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:18,943
Take angles towards it

1144
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:21,759
And we try and see where each other land

1145
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:26,367
And then we try and convince each other of our positions and whether or not

1146
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:27,903
Inferior or perhaps

1147
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:29,183
Equal to each other

1148
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:32,255
You however have taken everything I've said

1149
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:38,655
Ignored it and then completely different direction a tentative mischaracterized maybe everything

1150
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:42,495
I had a when I was in college I took a class on

1151
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:43,263
Pomodoro

1152
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:46,591
Yoshi fight

1153
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:49,407
Rabbi

1154
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:52,479
Define for Liberation theology

1155
01:04:52,735 --> 01:04:58,367
Probably that's that's exactly what that is I don't remember a ton of what I learned about the tour up because

1156
01:04:58,623 --> 01:04:59,135
Quite frankly

1157
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:06,559
Stuff going to come back

1158
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:09,375
They really remembered about him

1159
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:11,679
Experiential

1160
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:13,215
In the class

1161
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:15,519
Conversation

1162
01:05:15,775 --> 01:05:16,287
3 Florin,

1163
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:25,503
Yeah and impressed upon us really early in the

1164
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:27,039
Where was

1165
01:05:27,295 --> 01:05:30,111
The beginning of any kind of like real conversation you

1166
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:31,135
You can have with anybody

1167
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:31,903
The definition

1168
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:34,719
You have to be sure that you're talkin about the

1169
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:35,743
The same thing

1170
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:36,511
Before you

1171
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:37,279
Can get anywhere

1172
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:43,935
And I don't think that all bills.

1173
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:49,311
He's trying to nail down what are we talkin about if we are going to talk

1174
01:05:49,823 --> 01:05:50,591
Fliptop

1175
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:57,503
I'm ready to talk about Liberation theology if you want

1176
01:05:57,759 --> 01:06:02,879
I don't know a lot about Liberation theology

1177
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:09,279
George Soros

1178
01:06:09,535 --> 01:06:15,679
But I don't know a lot about the Pope

1179
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:18,495
I'm really not

1180
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:21,823
You are okay

1181
01:06:24,895 --> 01:06:26,431
Remember about Rabbi signs

1182
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:27,967
Class was that

1183
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:29,759

1186
01:06:33,087 --> 01:06:33,855
You should always has a rash

1187
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:36,671
Moving out

1193
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:49,215
Looking at them

1194
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:51,775
Assessing what they're bringing to your life

1195
01:06:53,311 --> 01:06:53,823
Think positive

1196
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:55,103
You can walk away from them

1197
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:56,639
Choose an interesting idea

1198
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:57,919

01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:15,839
Well but he's

1208
01:07:16,095 --> 01:07:17,119
He's like

1209
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:19,679

Like this

1213
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:29,663
Not being able to this is the a****** in your class

1214
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:31,967
Who is just trying to

1215

50 people in a

1217
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:37,343
F****** room

And everybody is like I'm hungover and I just want to go to the edges want to go to my next class or whatever the f***

1219
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:47,327
Turn the looks at his

1220
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:50,911
Staring daggers at like we're going to be here another 25

1221
01:07:51,423 --> 01:07:52,447
But the professor is like

1222
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:53,727
My job

1223
01:07:53,983 --> 01:07:54,751
Is to educate

1224
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:04,479
There's no education

1225
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:05,759
There's nothing to that

1226
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:08,575
Less quickly ended with

1227
01:08:10,623 --> 01:08:13,183
Alex

1228
01:08:13,695 --> 01:08:14,207
Who is saying

1229
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:15,999

1236
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:52,095
Fake laugh

1237
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:54,143
Because he knows what

1238
01:08:55,935 --> 01:08:56,447
I know it is

1239
01:08:57,471 --> 01:08:58,495
I've known what he's doing this

1240
01:08:58,751 --> 01:08:59,263
This entire time

1241
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:00,031
It's not hard.

1242
01:09:00,543 --> 01:09:03,103
He is going to accidentally say what he's doing

1243
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:04,895
In a little bit

1244
01:09:05,151 --> 01:09:06,431
But before he does that

1245
01:09:06,687 --> 01:09:08,223
Search the weakest link in the chain

1246
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:09,247
Before he does that

1247
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:12,575
Explains if'n they come back from commercial today

1248
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:17,695

Professor Ayers

1258
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:46,879

01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:17,087
I disagree with you

1268
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:18,367
Fundamentally

1269
01:10:18,623 --> 01:10:24,767
And I guess you believe that we have a real form of capitalism disagree with that

1270
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:31,935
Sitting on top of a socialist management

1271
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:32,959
We're back to the food.

1272
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:37,823
He's a fraud

1273
01:10:38,847 --> 01:10:40,895
I have no idea what you're talking about but

CID

Power

1285
01:11:55,647 --> 01:11:57,439
The CIA was formed in 1947

1286
01:11:58,463 --> 01:11:58,975
Bright

1287
01:11:59,231 --> 01:11:59,743
Mouth and tongue

1288
01:12:00,255 --> 01:12:00,767
And Power Inn

1289
01:12:01,023 --> 01:12:01,535
1849

1290
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:03,583
Officially

1291
01:12:03,839 --> 01:12:07,423
Was the first act officially but he was already

1292
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:09,983
Pretty much an hour

1293
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:12,799
Nobody has created to make

1294
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:15,871
Mauser officially

1295
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:17,151
For control of China

1296
01:12:17,407 --> 01:12:18,175
Chiang Kai-shek

1297
01:12:18,431 --> 01:12:19,967
And I

1298
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:25,087
What ended up happening was around 19

1299
01:12:25,599 --> 01:12:27,391
36 or so I

1300
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:28,671
That we decided

1301
01:12:29,183 --> 01:12:31,487
We should be back in Chiang Kai-shek

1302
01:12:32,767 --> 01:12:33,279
It's going to

1303
01:12:33,535 --> 01:12:34,559
To be a huge hassle

1304
01:12:34,815 --> 01:12:37,119
Little bit behind on that one

1305
01:12:37,631 --> 01:12:41,471
A lot of work China govern

1306
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:43,007
Yeah and it's

1307
01:12:43,263 --> 01:12:45,055
We withdrew support

1308
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:46,591
Because we knew that it would be

1309
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:48,383
Live

1310
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:49,919
Count log

1311
01:12:50,175 --> 01:12:50,943
Unbelievable

1312
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:52,479
I'm so

1313
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:54,015
To the extent that the United

1314
01:12:54,271 --> 01:12:56,319
States government decided to not get involved

1315
01:12:56,575 --> 01:12:57,599
On behalf of

1316
01:12:57,855 --> 01:12:59,135
Someone who was our Ally

1317
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:00,927
Yeah we did do that

1318
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:04,255
We passively allowed Mao Zedong to

1319
01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:05,791
Power

1320
01:13:07,071 --> 01:13:10,399
Was going to happen

1321
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:17,311
Immediately following you can always following me

1322
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:18,847
We're still dealing with the Rams

1323
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:20,127
Locations of the Rape of Nanking

1324
01:13:20,895 --> 01:13:22,943
And that's when you get into like

1325
01:13:23,455 --> 01:13:24,991
If you have a

1326
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:26,783
If you have a foreign power

1327
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:29,087
Decimating your entire population

1328
01:13:29,855 --> 01:13:34,207
You're going to wind up getting a nationalist leader who says he's going to protect you from

1329
01:13:37,023 --> 01:13:37,535
So

1330
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:39,071
1046

1331
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:41,375

1335
01:13:46,495 --> 01:13:47,007
Anyway

1336
01:13:47,263 --> 01:13:48,287
Leave it like

1337
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:50,079
Within a year-and-a-half

1338
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:51,615
Of the CIA formed

1339
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:52,895
They were able to

1340
01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:57,759
Craft their ability to put into power

1341
01:13:58,015 --> 01:14:02,111
A dictator in the biggest country in the world

1342
01:14:02,367 --> 01:14:04,159
The CIA was only officially

1343
01:14:05,183 --> 01:14:05,951
Put into place

1344
01:14:06,463 --> 01:14:06,975
Vine

1345
01:14:07,231 --> 01:14:07,743
Faygo

1346
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:15,167
This is where we would do a jack off

1347
01:14:15,423 --> 01:14:21,567
What do you like

1348
01:14:21,823 --> 01:14:22,591
Alright buddy

1349
01:14:23,871 --> 01:14:30,015
It was Declassified before congratulations

1350
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:34,367
For some reason

1351
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:37,183
I just love the idea of

1352
01:14:37,695 --> 01:14:39,743
A completely reasonable person

1353
01:14:40,511 --> 01:14:43,839
Confronted with

1354
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:50,495
The most unreasonable person a person but no type of which this guy is like

1355
01:14:50,751 --> 01:14:53,311
You're texting the wrong person

1356
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:54,079
Shut off

1357
01:14:54,335 --> 01:14:55,359
Bomb

1358
01:14:55,615 --> 01:15:01,247
In my world that is the most reasonably priced something reasonable thing to do

1359
01:15:01,503 --> 01:15:03,039
Betsy's like the most reasonable

1360
01:15:05,343 --> 01:15:06,111
Justice

1361
01:15:06,879 --> 01:15:07,391
Like

1362
01:15:08,415 --> 01:15:11,231
Do you exist

1363
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:14,303
Like that's what I hear in this interview the whole time

1364
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:17,631
Unfucked

1365
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:18,655
Your

1366
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:22,751
This represents

1367
01:15:23,007 --> 01:15:24,543
Oven steak

1368
01:15:25,823 --> 01:15:27,359
I'm not going to reach you

1369
01:15:27,615 --> 01:15:29,663
I don't know you might be projector

1370
01:15:29,919 --> 01:15:30,431
Too much of the

1371
01:15:31,455 --> 01:15:32,479
Because I

1372
01:15:32,735 --> 01:15:35,039
Like I'm projecting a ridiculous

1373
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:39,647
I think he was

1374
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:44,255
Annoyed look

1375
01:15:46,815 --> 01:15:48,607
I believe you crestfallen

1376
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:50,399
I think he I think he maybe

1377
01:15:50,655 --> 01:15:51,935
For a second

1378
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:52,703
Quickly

1379
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:53,727
Into

1380
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:54,751
Intellectuals

1381
01:15:55,007 --> 01:15:56,543
Superiority right just like

1382
01:15:59,615 --> 01:16:03,199
Figure out what he's talking about we could talk about it if I can

1383
01:16:03,455 --> 01:16:06,271
If he will actually say what

1384
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:10,367
Kind of

1385
01:16:10,623 --> 01:16:11,903
Bill Ayers

1386
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:14,975
Stop having conversation and starts playing sudoku

1387
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:18,559
Our you got up

1388
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:21,375
Cambiar in an hour

1389
01:16:21,631 --> 01:16:22,911
Refuse

1390
01:16:25,983 --> 01:16:26,495
I think went

1391
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:27,519
So poorly

1392
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:28,287
For Alex

1393
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:29,823
That at this point

1394
01:16:30,079 --> 01:16:30,591
Just got to like

1395
01:16:31,103 --> 01:16:32,127
I think he was hoping to

1396
01:16:34,175 --> 01:16:39,551
Trump card

1397
01:16:39,807 --> 01:16:40,831
For him

1398
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:41,855
He's like

1399
01:16:42,367 --> 01:16:42,879
I got to get

1400
01:16:43,135 --> 01:16:44,927
To it so he just gets Patty about the bomb

1401
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:46,975
The interview

1402
01:16:51,583 --> 01:16:52,863
Mild-mannered

1403
01:17:04,895 --> 01:17:07,199
By our government

1404
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:22,047
Property

1405
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:24,863
Position

1406
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:29,983
6000 police officers

1407
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:48,927
Because you know what I'm going to do

1408
01:17:49,183 --> 01:17:50,975
Of what you're saying and then

1409
01:17:59,167 --> 01:17:59,935
You say

1410
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:04,799
To say what I want them to say overlay them with

1411
01:18:05,567 --> 01:18:06,847
The things that you don't want me

1412
01:18:07,103 --> 01:18:08,383
I'm using you as a prop

1413
01:18:11,711 --> 01:18:12,223
Alex

1414
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:15,807
First person to

1415
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:17,855
Ask him about that

1416
01:18:18,367 --> 01:18:20,671
He has been a professor for how long

1417
01:18:20,927 --> 01:18:26,303
How many job interviews do you think started with are you going to bomb us

1418
01:18:26,815 --> 01:18:27,327
FBI

1419
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:29,631
F****** grills him about test

1420
01:18:29,887 --> 01:18:31,679
Crazy

1421
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:36,543
Okay well I've made it through my entire life but you know what

1422
01:18:36,799 --> 01:18:37,311
Alex

1423
01:18:37,823 --> 01:18:38,591
You got me

1424
01:18:39,103 --> 01:18:40,383
Come on

1425
01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:42,175
I understand

1426
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:44,991
Impetus to

1427
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:45,759
Let's paint things

1428
01:18:46,015 --> 01:18:47,039
Isn't it no way

1429
01:18:49,599 --> 01:18:51,391
You never you never heard anybody

1430
01:18:51,903 --> 01:18:52,415
Your bombs

1431
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:54,719
Put the number of Bob

1432
01:18:57,279 --> 01:18:57,791
2

1433
01:18:58,047 --> 01:18:59,071
Leave me to think like

1434
01:18:59,583 --> 01:19:02,399
Everyday to bomb the building they accidentally hurt somebody

1435
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:03,935
Baby like now we did that that was

1436
01:19:04,191 --> 01:19:04,959
Unfortunate whoever

1437
01:19:05,215 --> 01:19:06,239
Overdid it you take the blame

1438
01:19:09,311 --> 01:19:10,335
I can find really is like

1439
01:19:10,591 --> 01:19:11,103
Weatherman

1440
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:13,151
Related people

1441
01:19:13,663 --> 01:19:15,967
Townhouse

1442
01:19:16,223 --> 01:19:17,759
People got hurt Worthy

1443
01:19:18,015 --> 01:19:18,783
People who are making the bomb

1444
01:19:21,343 --> 01:19:23,903
Yeah they say that that was an inch

1445
01:19:24,415 --> 01:19:24,927
Sounds like

1446
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:25,951
From Baton Rouge

1447
01:19:26,207 --> 01:19:26,719
Became very

1448
01:19:27,231 --> 01:19:30,559
Careful and make sure even our own people weren't hurt

1449
01:19:33,375 --> 01:19:33,887
Truck

1450
01:19:34,143 --> 01:19:35,167
What are those

1451
01:19:37,727 --> 01:19:39,263
That seems more like an insta

1452
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:40,543
Just like

1453
01:19:41,055 --> 01:19:46,687
People who were involved with Weather Underground also trying a problem

1454
01:19:53,087 --> 01:19:54,623
Subway

1455
01:19:54,879 --> 01:19:55,903
Sort of the thing that they were in

1456
01:19:56,415 --> 01:19:59,999
Purple peppers

1457
01:20:05,631 --> 01:20:06,143
Sure

1458
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:06,911
Oh yeah

1459
01:20:08,959 --> 01:20:10,751
The plot of Die Hard

1460
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:19,456
For a long time go for at least

1461
01:20:21,504 --> 01:20:23,040
What 30

1462
01:20:25,856 --> 01:20:26,368
Which one

1463
01:20:28,416 --> 01:20:29,696
Cygnus conversation turns out

1464
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:34,816
Trying to jog my memory like nope don't care

1465
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:36,096
So

1466
01:20:37,376 --> 01:20:39,424
The other one was

1467
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:40,704
There was a bombing

1468
01:20:41,472 --> 01:20:41,984
That

1469
01:20:44,032 --> 01:20:44,800
Got injured at

1470
01:20:45,568 --> 01:20:47,104
Around the time

1471
01:20:48,384 --> 01:20:48,896
The weathermen

1472
01:20:49,664 --> 01:20:53,248
Which was not necessarily A weathermen bombing

1473
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:56,064
Right no one is

1474
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:57,600
Proven that they were

1475
01:20:58,112 --> 01:20:59,904
Rap

1476
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:01,440
Like I would be willing

1477
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:03,232
I don't know

1478
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:06,816
Approved it to me

1479
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:11,936
If if they wanted to hurt people right

1480
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:13,728
The effect like

1481
01:21:15,264 --> 01:21:16,032
The wave

1482
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:18,080
Able to operate as a terrorist

1483
01:21:18,336 --> 01:21:19,104
Organization

1484
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:20,896
4 years

1485
01:21:21,152 --> 01:21:21,664
Right

1486
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:25,760
At least believe they could have killed a lot more people if they want it

1487
01:21:28,064 --> 01:21:32,416
A smartphone involved

1488
01:21:32,672 --> 01:21:33,184
You could have had some

1489
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:34,720
I'm really great

1490
01:21:37,024 --> 01:21:38,304
My gut tells

1491
01:21:39,072 --> 01:21:39,584
They wouldn't

1492
01:21:40,352 --> 01:21:41,120
Do all of this

1493
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:42,144
Is politically motivated

1494
01:21:44,448 --> 01:21:45,472
Like legitimate

1495
01:21:45,728 --> 01:21:51,104
Extreme vandalism as he called

1496
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:52,640
Who didn't even die

1497
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:53,920
You guy gets hurt

1498
01:21:54,176 --> 01:22:00,320
Right that seems like a waste of the entire principle that you can imagine that

1499
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:02,368
1

1500
01:22:02,624 --> 01:22:04,416
Part of the reason that they were successful

1501
01:22:04,672 --> 01:22:06,208
For so long is that they did

1502
01:22:06,464 --> 01:22:06,976
Actually kill

1503
01:22:07,488 --> 01:22:13,632
Bright like that was kind of part of the big deal the priority

1504
01:22:13,888 --> 01:22:14,912
Just destroying property

1505
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:17,472
Destroying rich people

1506
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:19,008
That's far more

1507
01:22:20,032 --> 01:22:20,544
Important

1508
01:22:21,312 --> 01:22:21,824
Legal system

1509
01:22:23,104 --> 01:22:23,872
A million

1510
01:22:24,128 --> 01:22:24,640
But

1511
01:22:27,456 --> 01:22:28,736
There's nothing

1512
01:22:29,504 --> 01:22:30,528
Maybe they did

1513
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:33,088
There's no way for it there's no way for me to know

1514
01:22:33,344 --> 01:22:33,856
I don't know

1515
01:22:35,136 --> 01:22:36,160
Motivation

1516
01:22:36,416 --> 01:22:37,440
A project chaos

1517
01:22:39,232 --> 01:22:39,744
Fight Club

1518
01:22:40,256 --> 01:22:41,536
I assume

1519
01:22:42,048 --> 01:22:43,584
You think so it is much as they age

1520
01:22:44,096 --> 01:22:44,608
Asteroid

1521
01:22:44,864 --> 01:22:45,632
Empty building that

1522
01:22:45,888 --> 01:22:46,656
Yaga

1523
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:52,032
That's gross

1524
01:22:54,592 --> 01:22:57,920
We abandon our podcast

1525
01:23:02,272 --> 01:23:05,344
Call Chuck Palahniuk fuckyourself

1526
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:08,928
I believe

1527
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:11,744
Sincerely

1528
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:14,304
Kill anybody

1529
01:23:15,328 --> 01:23:16,096
If they hurt anybody

1530
01:23:16,608 --> 01:23:17,376
It was not in

1531
01:23:20,448 --> 01:23:21,216
Unfortunate

1532
01:23:21,472 --> 01:23:21,984
Side effects

1533
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:25,568
A bomb

1534
01:23:25,824 --> 01:23:29,664
That seems like a really shity

1535
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:30,688
Like anybody

1536
01:23:30,944 --> 01:23:32,736
Gets killed by a bomb

1537
01:23:34,528 --> 01:23:35,296
Was

1538
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:37,088
Entirely their intention

1539
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:38,624
To not hurt

1540
01:23:39,904 --> 01:23:40,928
Their intention

1541
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:43,232
Was to destroy property

1542
01:23:43,744 --> 01:23:44,768
To bring attention

1543
01:23:45,024 --> 01:23:46,560
That was going on

1544
01:23:46,816 --> 01:23:47,840
All the murderer

1545
01:23:48,096 --> 01:23:48,608
Exactly

1546
01:23:49,888 --> 01:23:50,400
So

1547
01:23:51,168 --> 01:23:51,936
I believe they had a

1548
01:23:53,472 --> 01:23:55,264
I guess all I can really say for certain

1549
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:56,032
Is

1550
01:23:56,288 --> 01:23:57,312
Everything I know

1551
01:23:58,592 --> 01:23:59,360
Hearing bill

1552
01:24:01,152 --> 01:24:02,176
As much as I've read

1553
01:24:02,944 --> 01:24:03,456
I believe there was

1554
01:24:06,016 --> 01:24:07,808
A desire for a politically-motivated Act

1555
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:09,856
Alex's

1556
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:10,880
Question

1557
01:24:11,648 --> 01:24:12,928
The only thing that

1558
01:24:13,184 --> 01:24:13,696
Can be

1559
01:24:15,744 --> 01:24:16,512
Responsive

1560
01:24:18,048 --> 01:24:18,560
Yeah

1561
01:24:18,816 --> 01:24:19,328
Super weird

1562
01:24:20,864 --> 01:24:22,144
It's also exactly what you do

1563
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:37,248
Government

1564
01:24:38,784 --> 01:24:41,600
And we engaged

1565
01:24:43,392 --> 01:24:46,208
Crossing Lines

1566
01:24:58,496 --> 01:25:02,080
And blew up that building a false flag

1567
01:25:02,336 --> 01:25:04,384
Lightfoot

1568
01:25:11,552 --> 01:25:12,832
Absolutely not

1569
01:25:27,424 --> 01:25:28,192
Another like

1570
01:25:28,448 --> 01:25:30,496
Shift of the quest

1571
01:25:32,288 --> 01:25:36,384
He's just constantly child

1572
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:37,408
I don't like your answer

1573
01:25:37,664 --> 01:25:40,992
Whatever your answer is I'm going to disagree with it I want to get

1574
01:25:41,248 --> 01:25:47,392
What do you want is already assigned exactly

1575
01:25:47,648 --> 01:25:53,280
Realize I said exactly

1576
01:25:53,792 --> 01:25:56,352
It's interesting because it's like

1577
01:25:56,608 --> 01:25:57,888
It's like an interview

1578
01:25:58,144 --> 01:25:58,656
Unlikes

1579
01:25:58,912 --> 01:25:59,680
60 minutes where there's a

1580
01:25:59,936 --> 01:26:00,704
Bunch of God

1581
01:26:03,008 --> 01:26:05,824
They never ant-like think the answer is never

1582
01:26:07,104 --> 01:26:08,640
Play It's almost like

1583
01:26:08,896 --> 01:26:14,016
It's just one side.

1584
01:26:14,272 --> 01:26:17,344
Right show a picture

1585
01:26:17,856 --> 01:26:20,416
Of the gyrus of the guy like looking at

1586
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:24,256
Interview

1587
01:26:24,512 --> 01:26:25,280
The guy didn't

1588
01:26:25,536 --> 01:26:27,584
Show up

1589
01:26:28,096 --> 01:26:28,608
This is

1590
01:26:28,864 --> 01:26:29,632
This is

1591
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:32,960
Clint Eastwood yelling at a f****** chair

1592
01:26:33,472 --> 01:26:33,984

That's what it is it's

1595
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:38,592
It's like if

1596
01:26:39,872 --> 01:26:40,896
Like if Obama was

1597
01:26:41,664 --> 01:26:42,432
In that chair

1598
01:26:42,944 --> 01:26:44,224
And he was like well actually

1599
01:26:44,736 --> 01:26:49,088
I've been politely explained like wow you got it

1600
01:26:49,344 --> 01:26:50,112
Some things a bit wrong

1601
01:26:50,368 --> 01:26:53,440
Ivan Clint Eastwood through smoke bomb.

1602
01:26:53,696 --> 01:26:55,488
And all Clint Eastwood

1603

Putting rectangular in reality there was the person

1604
01:27:04,192 --> 01:27:04,960
Significant

1605
01:27:06,752 --> 01:27:07,520
Not about Obama

1606
01:27:08,288 --> 01:27:10,336
You don't but that wasn't

1607
01:27:10,592 --> 01:27:12,896
Who is the voice of the great but the inflection

1608
01:27:13,152 --> 01:27:16,480
You got the info not that wasn't

1609
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:20,320
Episode

1610
01:27:20,576 --> 01:27:21,344
At this point

1611
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:24,416
Velazquez Buford Alexei

1612
01:27:25,184 --> 01:27:26,976
What about Larry grass wall

1613
01:27:27,232 --> 01:27:28,768
The guy who we heard

1614
01:27:29,536 --> 01:27:31,072
Who is the FBI Informer

1615
01:27:31,328 --> 01:27:32,096
Man who had canceled

1616
01:27:33,376 --> 01:27:33,888
The weather

1617
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:35,680
Had a bit of a

1618
01:27:36,192 --> 01:27:36,704
Now

1619
01:27:37,472 --> 01:27:37,984
This

1620
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:38,752
Response

1621
01:27:39,008 --> 01:27:39,776
Larry gives

1622
01:27:41,056 --> 01:27:41,824
I'm not Larry

1623
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:43,872
This response

1624
01:27:44,128 --> 01:27:45,408
The bill comes up with

1625
01:27:45,664 --> 01:27:46,688
Is Zoloft

1626
01:27:47,712 --> 01:27:49,760
So exactly what you would

1627
01:27:50,016 --> 01:27:53,088
How you would respond if you work making something up

1628
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:54,112
And it is

1629
01:27:54,624 --> 01:27:55,392
The biggest problem

1630
01:27:55,648 --> 01:27:56,160
A Alex

1631
01:27:56,416 --> 01:27:56,928
It's such a

1632
01:27:57,184 --> 01:27:57,696
Huge problem

1633
01:28:20,224 --> 01:28:23,808
Pretty much a creature of whatever whoever runs the justice department

1634
01:28:27,392 --> 01:28:31,232
Preacher of the justice department

1635
01:28:32,512 --> 01:28:38,656
How's the justice department

1636
01:28:41,984 --> 01:28:47,616
I believe

1637
01:28:47,872 --> 01:28:54,016
Military

1638
01:29:20,384 --> 01:29:23,200
The levels make it sound like

1639
01:29:23,456 --> 01:29:24,736
He said more

1640
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:26,272
And the

1641
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:27,296
Broadcasters like

1642
01:29:29,088 --> 01:29:29,856
If he did

1643
01:29:31,136 --> 01:29:34,464
Cuz this

1644
01:29:35,744 --> 01:29:41,888
Straight off the Alex Jones channel to make that sound like

1645
01:29:42,144 --> 01:29:46,496
Cut off from their crazy about that

1646
01:29:49,056 --> 01:29:50,592
Or why didn't they not

1647
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:52,128
You don't mean like

1648
01:29:52,384 --> 01:29:54,176
They are still

1649
01:29:55,456 --> 01:29:56,992
The business somewhere in there

1650
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:06,208
That's terrible

1651
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:12,096

Feel bad

1671
01:31:13,024 --> 01:31:14,560
Could have also just been

1672
01:31:15,584 --> 01:31:16,864
Kicking into autopilot in

1673
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:17,632

You hear it that's not the same audio

1682
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:47,328
I know it's not but it also I could recreate that

1683
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:51,680
I could like without a

1684
01:31:51,936 --> 01:31:52,960

1685
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:56,544

01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:58,080
Excited

1692
01:32:16,512 --> 01:32:22,144
The obvious obvious

1693
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:22,912
I'm still

1694
01:32:31,872 --> 01:32:37,248

1721
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:39,968
Cuz if he was telling the truth

1722
01:33:40,736 --> 01:33:42,016
I committed a

1723
01:33:42,272 --> 01:33:43,296
Capital punish

1724
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:49,440
I would have been

1725
01:33:49,696 --> 01:33:50,720
Put to the death penalty

1726
01:33:51,744 --> 01:33:53,024
Yeah

1727
01:33:53,792 --> 01:33:56,352
There's literally no other

1728
01:33:56,864 --> 01:33:59,680
A prescription for that crime

1729
01:33:59,936 --> 01:34:00,960
Shared enough to

1730
01:34:01,216 --> 01:34:03,008
Plant someone in the organization

1731
01:34:03,264 --> 01:34:04,032
Credible

1732
01:34:04,288 --> 01:34:09,664
And came out with that information I would have acted on it

1733
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:14,272
Who was president later because I got it I got a spoiler alert for you

1734
01:34:14,528 --> 01:34:15,808
Until the time

1735
01:34:16,064 --> 01:34:16,832
That VI

Torrid

01:37:31,648 --> 01:37:34,208
I love his interview I wish all interviews were like this

1787
01:37:34,464 --> 01:37:40,608
I'm done with any kind of conversations that exist I am all about some random dude just say

1788
01:37:42,144 --> 01:37:43,424

1793
01:37:53,664 --> 01:37:56,736
You're a dick what's the diagram

1794
01:38:03,136 --> 01:38:03,648
Kudos

1795
01:38:03,904 --> 01:38:06,464
Where it's going to land exactly but it's going down

1796
01:38:06,976 --> 01:38:08,512
He knows all

1797
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:10,560
You start with

1798
01:38:10,816 --> 01:38:11,328
Like a

1799
01:38:13,632 --> 01:38:14,656
You say you're not a maoist

1800
01:38:14,912 --> 01:38:15,936
Look at your logo

1801
01:38:16,192 --> 01:38:16,704
Hippie like

1802
01:38:17,216 --> 01:38:19,008

You know

1804
01:38:20,288 --> 01:38:22,848
There's a lot of people who have logos that are similar

1805
01:38:23,104 --> 01:38:23,616
He's not staying

1806
01:38:23,872 --> 01:38:26,688
Anything other than like

1807
01:38:27,712 --> 01:38:29,504
Baby I just like the color scheme

1808
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:32,320
I think that's kind of the bottom line

1809
01:38:36,416 --> 01:38:37,952
Famous

1810
01:38:38,208 --> 01:38:39,232
, you son of a b****

1811
01:38:39,488 --> 01:38:40,768
Well I'm not famous

1812
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:47,424
What are you doing with this show knows who I am

1813
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:53,056
What is

1814
01:38:56,640 --> 01:38:59,200
It's so great here's what I say

1815
01:39:00,736 --> 01:39:03,296
A purely

1816
01:39:08,416 --> 01:39:09,184
Alex

1817
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:09,952
Is just

1818
01:39:10,208 --> 01:39:11,232
Trying to Middle

1819
01:39:11,744 --> 01:39:14,560
Cuz Alex wants him to lose his ship

1820
01:39:14,816 --> 01:39:16,608
At some point Alex just wants him

1821
01:39:16,864 --> 01:39:22,496
Get mad one of us has got it I just want you

1822
01:39:22,752 --> 01:39:25,312
To get mad and yell at me about something

1823
01:39:25,568 --> 01:39:27,872
So I can cut that into a clip

1824
01:39:31,712 --> 01:39:34,528
You specifically lying about something hard

1825
01:39:36,064 --> 01:39:37,088
Did either of those things but

1826
01:39:37,344 --> 01:39:37,856
He is going to get some

1827
01:39:38,112 --> 01:39:38,880
Really good audio

1828
01:39:39,136 --> 01:39:39,904
Himself losing our

1829
01:39:56,800 --> 01:40:02,688
Talkin about

1830
01:40:08,576 --> 01:40:11,136
Children and their parents and their families are

1831
01:40:11,392 --> 01:40:13,440
Absolutely

1832
01:40:20,096 --> 01:40:21,376
Melissa harris-perry

1833
01:40:24,192 --> 01:40:25,472
Wait a minute about what

1834
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:40,064
Local community

1835
01:40:55,936 --> 01:41:02,080
And just as strong as our militaries

1836
01:41:04,384 --> 01:41:09,760
Domestic security

1837
01:41:10,016 --> 01:41:10,528
Okay

1838
01:41:10,784 --> 01:41:16,416
Wilson you know what

1839
01:41:16,928 --> 01:41:19,488
Alex had to and did admit

1840
01:41:19,744 --> 01:41:20,256
I'm wrong

1841
01:41:20,768 --> 01:41:25,888
And then had to move along

1842
01:41:26,144 --> 01:41:27,168
Because otherwise if you let

1843
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:30,496
Drawing attention to the fact

1844
01:41:30,752 --> 01:41:31,264
That

1845
01:41:31,776 --> 01:41:36,384
F****** Bill Ayers just made a point there's like okay there is a community interest

1846
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:39,968
In people's parents not being shity

1847
01:41:40,224 --> 01:41:44,064
Now is that is the case do you think there is an advantageous thing where the community

1848
01:41:44,576 --> 01:41:48,672
Does not benefit from allowing that abusive

1849
01:41:48,928 --> 01:41:51,232
You're wrong

1850
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:52,768
But that's where the

1851
01:41:53,024 --> 01:41:56,864
Mulan child Army

1852
01:41:57,632 --> 01:42:00,448
Can't actually argue with an unreasonable Act

1853
01:42:00,704 --> 01:42:01,984
This is the

1854
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:03,520
This is perhaps

1855
01:42:03,776 --> 01:42:06,592
The most perfect distillation of it that I think I've ever seen

1856
01:42:08,640 --> 01:42:10,432
Really astonishing

1857
01:42:12,224 --> 01:42:13,248
His bill is

1858
01:42:14,528 --> 01:42:16,832
Because it because so many people it would take

1859
01:42:19,392 --> 01:42:23,488
Unmute

1860
01:42:23,744 --> 01:42:27,072
Like with with members of my own family where it's like

1861
01:42:27,328 --> 01:42:28,608
It takes a while

1862
01:42:31,424 --> 01:42:32,704
Get angry the whole time they like

1863
01:42:33,216 --> 01:42:35,776
I don't like where this is going I'm I'm not

1864
01:42:36,032 --> 01:42:37,056
Feeling good about this

1865
01:42:37,312 --> 01:42:38,592
And then you get there

1866
01:42:38,848 --> 01:42:39,360
And they're like

1867
01:42:41,152 --> 01:42:41,920
What word

1868
01:42:42,432 --> 01:42:43,968
You know like that kind of thing

1869
01:42:44,224 --> 01:42:47,040
He just did it in two sentences that's astonishing

1870
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:51,648
But also

1871
01:42:51,904 --> 01:42:52,416
Also

1872
01:42:52,672 --> 01:42:53,184
Why are you doing this

1873
01:42:53,952 --> 01:42:58,304
What are you doing why are you doing this you could not do this

1874
01:42:59,072 --> 01:43:00,352
I don't know I think it might have been like

1875
01:43:01,376 --> 01:43:02,144
Nephews

1876
01:43:03,680 --> 01:43:04,448
If you did this

1877
01:43:05,216 --> 01:43:09,312
Siri

1878
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:16,224
Not I'm not I'm not presuming that like billares nephew or niece is like a fan of Alex Jones

1879
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:20,832
This guy's crazy

1880
01:43:21,088 --> 01:43:22,112
Are we still on

1881
01:43:22,368 --> 01:43:28,512
I will show them the clip the next day and there were like a look at how around their babies

1882
01:43:31,072 --> 01:43:31,584
So funny

1883
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:33,888
I can't think of maybe like a badass

1884
01:43:34,912 --> 01:43:36,704
Are very few explanations

1885
01:43:37,984 --> 01:43:38,496
For like

1886
01:43:39,008 --> 01:43:44,384
How because I mean

1887
01:43:44,640 --> 01:43:45,152
Bored

1888
01:43:47,456 --> 01:43:47,968
There is

1889
01:43:48,992 --> 01:43:49,504
Probably

1890
01:43:50,272 --> 01:43:51,040
3 minutes

1891
01:43:51,296 --> 01:43:53,088
To the beginning of the interview

1892
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:54,112
Where

1893
01:43:54,368 --> 01:43:55,392
Can see in his face like

1894
01:43:56,160 --> 01:43:59,232
Oh boy

1895
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,280
I'm kind of in for it

1896
01:44:03,328 --> 01:44:04,096
Stick around for the whole lot

1897
01:44:04,608 --> 01:44:05,120
So

1898
01:44:09,216 --> 01:44:09,728
It is next

1899
01:44:11,776 --> 01:44:12,288
Jester's there

1900
01:44:18,688 --> 01:44:21,504
I would say this is

1901
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:22,784
The point where Bill

1902
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:23,552
Start

1903
01:44:23,808 --> 01:44:24,576
To fight back

1904
01:44:25,088 --> 01:44:25,600
A little bit

1905
01:44:26,112 --> 01:44:27,392
And start to be a dick back

1906
01:44:27,904 --> 01:44:34,048

Marxist-leninist

1920
01:46:23,360 --> 01:46:29,504
Stop stop

1921
01:46:31,552 --> 01:46:36,160
There's no other explanation for that response like

1922
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:38,208
Are you lost

1923
01:46:38,464 --> 01:46:40,000
Yeah

1924
01:46:40,256 --> 01:46:40,768
Hard

1925
01:46:41,024 --> 01:46:41,536
Why

1926
01:46:41,792 --> 01:46:43,584
You would play that clip again

1927
01:46:48,704 --> 01:46:49,216

Father and

1934
01:47:10,720 --> 01:47:11,232
The white races

Superior

1936
01:47:12,768 --> 01:47:14,304
History of interviews.

Eugenics

1944
01:47:30,176 --> 01:47:30,688
Honestly

1945
01:47:30,944 --> 01:47:32,736
I'm not that I regret on

1946
01:47:32,992 --> 01:47:33,760
Some levels

1947
01:47:34,272 --> 01:47:35,040
Really like

1948
01:47:35,296 --> 01:47:35,808
Bill Ayers

1949
01:47:36,064 --> 01:47:39,392
You on some level think like

1950
01:47:39,648 --> 01:47:40,416
You know I know

1951
01:47:40,672 --> 01:47:41,184
You didn't mean

1952
01:47:41,696 --> 01:47:42,208
Anybody with

1953
01:47:42,464 --> 01:47:42,976
Those bombs

1954
01:47:44,768 --> 01:47:45,280
Stream

1955
01:47:46,304 --> 01:47:47,840
I have a difficult

1956
01:47:48,864 --> 01:47:50,144
I think his answer about you

1957
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:52,192
Eugenics is perfectly measured

1958
01:47:52,448 --> 01:47:53,728
I think it's a really good answer

1959
01:47:53,984 --> 01:47:56,544
My only thought that likes so far

1960
01:47:56,800 --> 01:47:59,104
Listening to Bellaire

1961
01:47:59,616 --> 01:48:01,408
Is listening to him call it at

1962
01:48:01,664 --> 01:48:02,432
Extreme acts of

1963
01:48:02,688 --> 01:48:03,456
Vandalism

1964
01:48:03,712 --> 01:48:04,736
Is kind of like

1965
01:48:04,992 --> 01:48:05,504
Alright dude

1966
01:48:06,016 --> 01:48:06,784
Just f****** sake bombs

1967
01:48:09,088 --> 01:48:15,232
No but that sounds like

1968
01:48:18,304 --> 01:48:20,608
Extreme acts of vandalism sounds like that late

1969
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:21,888
Steve's early 7

1970
01:48:22,144 --> 01:48:24,704
Wendy's Abbie Hoffman kind of like

1971
01:48:25,216 --> 01:48:30,336
I don't like you I don't like you from

1972
01:48:30,592 --> 01:48:35,200
Whatever

1973
01:48:35,456 --> 01:48:41,600
I don't like I don't like Frick you like hard drives

1974
01:48:49,024 --> 01:48:51,584
You blew that s*** up because they were doing

1975
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:54,400
I'm infinitely worship

1976
01:48:54,656 --> 01:48:55,680
Some of it is no use

1977
01:49:00,288 --> 01:49:00,800
Sarek

1978
01:49:06,176 --> 01:49:06,688
Is eugenics

1979
01:49:07,200 --> 01:49:08,480
Are you aware

1980
01:49:21,024 --> 01:49:24,352
Gable Wars

1981
01:49:24,864 --> 01:49:28,192
Black community

1982
01:49:48,928 --> 01:49:49,952
Represent

1983
01:49:50,208 --> 01:49:52,256
Vestigial

1984
01:49:52,768 --> 01:49:58,912
Asus eugenical maybe you never got that high the power structure but that's what it is

1985
01:50:03,008 --> 01:50:05,568
I don't know

1986
01:50:09,664 --> 01:50:11,712
Racial superiority in white supremacy

1987
01:50:11,968 --> 01:50:15,808
Has never been

1988
01:50:19,392 --> 01:50:22,720
So again I don't I don't accept your premise

1989
01:50:23,232 --> 01:50:26,560
There's a lot of that

1990
01:50:32,704 --> 01:50:35,264
F*** are you talking about but it's tough because

1991
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:37,824
I think a lot of people don't know that that's an option

1992
01:50:38,336 --> 01:50:41,920
You can be in a conversation with someone

1993
01:50:43,456 --> 01:50:46,528
No I don't accept that

1994
01:50:47,296 --> 01:50:48,832
No

1995
01:50:49,344 --> 01:50:52,928
But

1996
01:50:53,184 --> 01:50:54,208
Until you can

1997
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:57,536
Prove it

1998
01:50:58,304 --> 01:50:59,840
I'm just going to say no

1999
01:51:03,424 --> 01:51:03,936
Amen

2000
01:51:04,448 --> 01:51:04,960
Because

2001
01:51:05,728 --> 01:51:07,008
Iowa

2002
01:51:07,264 --> 01:51:08,800
Smart man I am welcome

2003
01:51:09,056 --> 01:51:10,336
To you proving

2004
01:51:21,088 --> 01:51:21,856
I got nothing for you

2005
01:51:22,624 --> 01:51:25,184
We got we have nowhere to go with

2006
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:27,232
What conversation is there to have

2007
01:51:27,488 --> 01:51:29,792
You're arguing something that's made up

2008
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:31,072
Definition

2009
01:51:32,864 --> 01:51:33,376
The term

2010
01:51:33,632 --> 01:51:34,400
I Say I Do

2011
01:51:37,472 --> 01:51:37,984
So there we go

2012
01:51:38,240 --> 01:51:39,776
The middle

2013
01:51:43,360 --> 01:51:43,872
The knot Alex

2014
01:51:46,688 --> 01:51:47,712
Like a

2015
01:51:47,968 --> 01:51:53,344
So now Alex brings up

2016
01:51:53,600 --> 01:51:54,624
Tragedy and Hope

2017
01:51:56,672 --> 01:51:57,440
Hundred page book

2018
01:51:57,952 --> 01:51:59,744
Once again

2019
01:52:02,048 --> 01:52:02,560
And studying

2020
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:04,352
Passages

2021
01:52:04,864 --> 01:52:05,376
Taken out of

2022
01:52:06,144 --> 01:52:07,424
In the nun are called

2023
01:52:09,472 --> 01:52:09,984
Such

2024
01:52:11,008 --> 01:52:13,056
This reading

2025
01:52:13,568 --> 01:52:14,080
I think it's a

2026
01:52:16,128 --> 01:52:16,640
Amazing

2027
01:52:17,152 --> 01:52:17,920
I would love

2028
01:52:19,456 --> 01:52:19,968
Maybe

2029
01:52:20,224 --> 01:52:22,272
Three-month break from doing this show

2030
01:52:22,784 --> 01:52:24,576
Where I could go to

2031
01:52:26,624 --> 01:52:27,392
No the Bahamas

2032
01:52:27,904 --> 01:52:29,184
Bahamas

2033
01:52:31,232 --> 01:52:33,024
Degrees

2034
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:35,584
Take me to Greece

2035
01:52:37,376 --> 01:52:39,680
If you would like to donate to the

2036
01:52:40,448 --> 01:52:41,728
I think it would be fun

2037
01:52:41,984 --> 01:52:43,264
To have a relaxing

2038
01:52:44,032 --> 01:52:44,544
The week

2039
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:45,312
Or so where

2040
01:52:45,568 --> 01:52:46,336
I do nothing else

2041
01:52:47,360 --> 01:52:48,128
Get through

2042
01:52:49,408 --> 01:52:50,688
Cuz I've read a lot of it

2043
01:52:53,248 --> 01:52:53,760
Really

2044
01:52:54,272 --> 01:52:54,784
Interesting in

2045
01:52:55,040 --> 01:52:55,552
Death

2046
01:52:55,808 --> 01:52:56,576
Alive

2047
01:52:57,856 --> 01:52:58,368
Piece of

2048
01:52:58,880 --> 01:53:00,160
Historical

2049
01:53:00,416 --> 01:53:00,928
Narrative

2050
01:53:02,720 --> 01:53:03,488
Really well

2051
01:53:04,256 --> 01:53:04,768
The paragraph

2052
01:53:05,792 --> 01:53:07,584
Low into each other super well

2053
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:09,888
There's way too much information

2054
01:53:10,144 --> 01:53:10,912
Right

2055
01:53:11,168 --> 01:53:11,680
Somehow

2056
01:53:12,448 --> 01:53:13,216
Down in it

2057
01:53:13,472 --> 01:53:14,752
Okay there's a lot of like

2058
01:53:15,264 --> 01:53:17,312
Donation for why certain pieces

2059
01:53:17,824 --> 01:53:21,408
History flowed into other pieces

2060
01:53:23,968 --> 01:53:24,480
However

2061
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:30,368
You do believe that the passive voice is fine so I'm going to hold you I'm going to hold you

2062
01:53:30,624 --> 01:53:32,160
It's the same thing with John beholder

2063
01:53:35,488 --> 01:53:36,512
Like I started

2064
01:53:36,768 --> 01:53:37,792
Holyshit I

2065
01:53:38,048 --> 01:53:38,560
Didn't really

2066
01:53:40,096 --> 01:53:44,192
Now I do all day

2067
01:53:44,448 --> 01:53:45,728
Some good sentence

2068
01:53:46,240 --> 01:53:47,776
There's so much to be gained by

2069
01:53:48,032 --> 01:53:48,544
Reading Buffet

2070
01:53:50,336 --> 01:53:50,848
Yeah

2071
01:53:51,104 --> 01:53:52,384
I agree

2072
01:53:52,640 --> 01:53:53,408
I would love to

2073
01:53:54,176 --> 01:53:55,200
The other

2074
01:53:55,456 --> 01:53:56,224
700-page

2075
01:53:56,736 --> 01:53:57,248
But I haven't ridden

2076
01:53:57,504 --> 01:53:59,552
Read of Carroll Quigley

2077
01:53:59,808 --> 01:54:00,832
Tragedy

2078
01:54:01,088 --> 01:54:02,112
Cuz I get the

2079
01:54:02,624 --> 01:54:03,136
I get the prime

2080
01:54:05,696 --> 01:54:06,208
In tragedy

2081
01:54:07,232 --> 01:54:07,744
Is it

2082
01:54:09,280 --> 01:54:11,072
No it's the humanity keeps

2083
01:54:11,584 --> 01:54:12,096
Fighting with

2084
01:54:15,168 --> 01:54:18,496
Pizza forever

2085
01:54:18,752 --> 01:54:19,520
The whole part is

2086
01:54:20,288 --> 01:54:20,800
She hopes that we can

2087
01:54:23,360 --> 01:54:23,872
And work

2088
01:54:26,432 --> 01:54:26,944
Schedule

2089
01:54:27,200 --> 01:54:28,480
Horrible

2090
01:54:28,736 --> 01:54:32,064
Dailypay to Hope in the Hopeless way to track

2091
01:54:34,112 --> 01:54:35,136
Specific reference

2092
01:54:35,648 --> 01:54:36,160
But I found

2093
01:54:36,416 --> 01:54:36,928
From Alex

2094
01:54:37,184 --> 01:54:37,952
Yes wrong

Each Direction

2107
01:54:57,920 --> 01:54:58,688

2108
01:54:58,944 --> 01:55:00,480
All but these dudes

2109
01:55:00,736 --> 01:55:01,248
Claim they say

2110
01:55:01,504 --> 01:55:03,808
They haven't read the whole book

2111
01:55:04,320 --> 01:55:04,832
They haven't

2112
01:55:05,344 --> 01:55:05,856
They take

2113
01:55:06,368 --> 01:55:07,136
Just out of context

2114
01:55:07,392 --> 01:55:08,672
Yeah and they do that

2115
01:55:09,184 --> 01:55:09,696
In order

2116
01:55:09,952 --> 01:55:10,464

Liberal is

2119
01:55:12,768 --> 01:55:13,280
Existence

2120
01:55:16,352 --> 01:55:17,632
It's not important I only bring this up

2121
01:55:17,888 --> 01:55:18,400
How to say that

2122
01:55:19,424 --> 01:55:19,936
How to stupid

2123
01:55:20,704 --> 01:55:21,472
And

2124
01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:26,336
Quickly who's Bill Clinton

2125
01:55:26,592 --> 01:55:32,736
Favorite author

2126
01:55:36,064 --> 01:55:37,600
What's f*** Bill Clinton

2127
01:55:45,792 --> 01:55:46,816
No idea

2128
01:55:51,936 --> 01:55:53,216
Understand

2129
01:55:53,728 --> 01:55:56,288
Why they were funding fascist and communist

2130
01:56:01,664 --> 01:56:02,944
How the whole game work

2131
01:56:03,200 --> 01:56:03,712
Not

2132
01:56:06,272 --> 01:56:08,832
Big corporations

2133
01:56:09,344 --> 01:56:13,440
Kobe 11

2134
01:56:19,584 --> 01:56:25,728
I don't know he was

2135
01:56:33,152 --> 01:56:36,736
George Soros who just got caught finding 33 million

2136
01:57:12,320 --> 01:57:14,880
True

2137
01:57:15,136 --> 01:57:19,488
American government

2138
01:57:34,592 --> 01:57:35,104
Got his ass

2139
01:57:36,128 --> 01:57:36,640
Love it

2140
01:57:37,152 --> 01:57:38,944
Getaround

2141
01:57:39,456 --> 01:57:40,224
That

2142
01:57:47,136 --> 01:57:50,976
Is that the robber barons who funds are better than the robber baron

2143
01:57:53,280 --> 01:57:54,048
Who don't fund me

2144
01:57:54,560 --> 01:57:55,328
I'm sorry I just

2145
01:57:56,608 --> 01:57:58,144
Which what would I have

2146
01:57:58,400 --> 01:57:58,912
To do

2147
01:57:59,168 --> 01:57:59,936
With this

2148
01:58:00,192 --> 01:58:00,704
Finger me

2149
01:58:01,472 --> 01:58:03,520
The robber barons

2150
01:58:03,776 --> 01:58:04,800
That don't exist

2151
01:58:09,664 --> 01:58:10,432
I don't know

2152
01:58:11,456 --> 01:58:12,736
And you said nothing

2153
01:58:15,040 --> 01:58:16,320
Fine I don't know why you're ask

2154
01:58:16,576 --> 01:58:21,696
Remind me about it

2155
01:58:21,952 --> 01:58:25,024
The people that I associate with George Soros

2156
01:58:25,280 --> 01:58:27,840
Even though I don't know who you are

2157
01:58:34,240 --> 01:58:36,032
All of the demon

2158
01:58:43,200 --> 01:58:45,760
Do you really talk about

2159
01:58:46,016 --> 01:58:46,528
The foundations

2160
01:58:46,784 --> 01:58:48,320
I don't know what you're talkin about

2161
01:58:53,952 --> 01:58:57,280
I've slipped out of character

2162
01:58:57,536 --> 01:59:00,352
I'm much more comfortable when I'm doing the character of being Alex

2163
01:59:00,608 --> 01:59:04,448
I don't like being all right all right

2164
01:59:04,704 --> 01:59:05,984
Let's try the other way all right

2165
01:59:10,592 --> 01:59:11,872
I don't know what the scene is

2166
01:59:12,640 --> 01:59:15,712
You would never pay you would never make it past level 2 and

2167
01:59:15,968 --> 01:59:16,480
Second City

2168
01:59:19,552 --> 01:59:21,088
EagleRider

2169
01:59:21,344 --> 01:59:23,648
Maybe our off Beach

2170
01:59:24,160 --> 01:59:30,304
SNL you got three characters but you're going to you're going to be relegated to a writer

2171
01:59:32,352 --> 01:59:33,632
To write you a story about

2172
01:59:33,888 --> 01:59:34,400
This next quiet

2173
01:59:34,656 --> 01:59:38,496
How does get a transition

2174
01:59:39,264 --> 01:59:43,616
Trying to get this show to land within a reasonable amount of time

2175
01:59:43,872 --> 01:59:45,920
Like I said

2176
01:59:46,176 --> 01:59:46,688
He's losing

2177
01:59:50,272 --> 01:59:50,784
This is what I was trying to

2178
01:59:51,296 --> 01:59:51,808
Set up

2179
01:59:52,576 --> 01:59:53,088
Character

2180
01:59:53,344 --> 01:59:54,112
Butts Foundation

2181
01:59:54,624 --> 01:59:56,672
Talking about

2182
01:59:59,232 --> 02:00:00,000
Macon aggressive

2183
02:00:01,280 --> 02:00:01,792
Accusations

2184
02:00:08,448 --> 02:00:09,984
Fake left-wing ideology

2185
02:00:10,240 --> 02:00:11,776
As a form of domestication

2186
02:00:16,384 --> 02:00:22,016
Controlling

2187
02:00:28,672 --> 02:00:29,952
Executive orders

2188
02:00:30,464 --> 02:00:32,512
Right there already if you've lost the coin

2189
02:00:32,768 --> 02:00:33,792
We lost the point

2190
02:00:35,840 --> 02:00:36,608
Can't breathe

2191
02:00:36,864 --> 02:00:39,936
I can't breathe that

2192
02:00:40,192 --> 02:00:42,752
That hurt my neck into be hurt my neck

2193
02:00:43,264 --> 02:00:47,872
Do you know this a pinto just got stood for that crash

2194
02:00:57,600 --> 02:00:58,880
Alex

2195
02:00:59,392 --> 02:01:05,280
Quickly realizing

2196
02:01:07,328 --> 02:01:13,472
Referring to

2197
02:01:24,480 --> 02:01:27,552
Ago I think the ID

2198
02:01:35,232 --> 02:01:36,000
FairPoint

2199
02:01:36,256 --> 02:01:37,024
Perfect

2200
02:01:37,280 --> 02:01:38,048
Phil just making

2201
02:01:38,304 --> 02:01:39,840
FairPoint

2202
02:01:40,096 --> 02:01:42,656
Dancin

2203
02:01:42,912 --> 02:01:44,448
So far amount Bills team

2204
02:01:44,960 --> 02:01:46,240
All the way back from

2205
02:01:47,776 --> 02:01:48,800
To now

2206
02:01:49,312 --> 02:01:51,872
Only problem I have with him is him calling it

2207
02:01:52,128 --> 02:01:53,152
Extreme acts of

2208
02:01:53,408 --> 02:01:59,552
Turn the phrase 0 problems

2209
02:02:00,320 --> 02:02:02,112
Alex I will say his

2210
02:02:02,880 --> 02:02:03,392
Like it

2211
02:02:03,648 --> 02:02:06,208
Seems like his Kryptonite is someone saying what do you mean

2212
02:02:06,720 --> 02:02:08,256
Yeah

2213
02:02:10,816 --> 02:02:15,168
If he's used to flattery and then a change of subject

2214
02:02:18,240 --> 02:02:18,752
When were there

2215
02:02:19,264 --> 02:02:19,776
Friday

2216
02:02:20,288 --> 02:02:20,800
A land

2217
02:02:21,312 --> 02:02:24,384
Another plug for kept Around the Clock

2218
02:02:24,640 --> 02:02:26,432
There's no way he'll show up but if he

2219
02:02:26,688 --> 02:02:27,200
He does

2220
02:02:27,456 --> 02:02:28,480
I will just keep saying

2221
02:02:29,760 --> 02:02:31,808
All I want

2222
02:02:32,064 --> 02:02:33,088
The only dream I have

2223
02:02:33,600 --> 02:02:34,624
Is that David Knight

2224
02:02:34,880 --> 02:02:35,392
Shows up

2225
02:02:37,184 --> 02:02:42,816
That's what I'm I want David

2226
02:02:43,072 --> 02:02:45,120
I want to give David Knight of microphone

2227
02:02:45,376 --> 02:02:46,656
Just so we can both be like

2228
02:02:54,336 --> 02:02:58,176
Big shots and then after the show we danced around to like came out of a lady

2229
02:03:03,808 --> 02:03:08,416
Did David and Goliath that's possible

2230
02:03:08,672 --> 02:03:10,720
I don't I don't discount that is a possibility

2231
02:03:10,976 --> 02:03:11,488
Buckeye

2232
02:03:11,744 --> 02:03:13,280
This probably would be the greatest

2233
02:03:13,536 --> 02:03:14,048
Cast of all time

2234
02:03:14,304 --> 02:03:16,608
You and I just bothering you

2235
02:03:17,120 --> 02:03:21,472
But we

2236
02:03:21,728 --> 02:03:22,752
Personalities

2237
02:03:23,264 --> 02:03:27,616
We got to finish this

2238
02:03:28,128 --> 02:03:30,944
All right so I'm Bill billares an hour

2239
02:03:31,200 --> 02:03:32,224
Doctor talking

2240
02:03:32,736 --> 02:03:33,248
The point is

2241
02:03:33,504 --> 02:03:34,528
Still working under the

2242
02:03:34,784 --> 02:03:35,296
Assumption that he

2243
02:03:37,344 --> 02:03:39,136
I love God

2244
02:03:39,904 --> 02:03:40,416
Right

2245
02:03:40,672 --> 02:03:45,536
Ubill

2246
02:03:46,560 --> 02:03:51,680
I think there's a culture Clash here because we're not controlled left or control

2247
02:04:06,528 --> 02:04:10,880
Colibri bulwark and have the right to control their own guns

2248
02:04:12,672 --> 02:04:15,744
You're about to watch Chicago

2249
02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:22,656
You're an old-fashioned

2250
02:04:23,424 --> 02:04:27,008
Either we should eat

2251
02:04:34,944 --> 02:04:39,552
U.s. military

2252
02:04:39,808 --> 02:04:42,112
Homeless

2253
02:04:46,720 --> 02:04:47,744
So

2254
02:04:48,256 --> 02:04:50,816
This is Bill's way of having

2255
02:04:51,072 --> 02:04:51,584
Blackwell

2256
02:04:52,096 --> 02:04:53,888
Literally ready to be homeless

2257
02:04:54,144 --> 02:05:00,032
Or know of the homeless there

2258
02:05:00,288 --> 02:05:06,432
An example is a

2259
02:05:08,992 --> 02:05:10,272
Specifically tailored

2260
02:05:10,784 --> 02:05:11,296
Alex

2261
02:05:11,552 --> 02:05:15,648
I'm saying that it is a ideology

2262
02:05:16,416 --> 02:05:17,952
Suggest everyone should be

2263
02:05:22,304 --> 02:05:23,840
People being arms that they don't like

2264
02:05:24,096 --> 02:05:26,144
Bill 100% is setting up Alex

2265
02:05:26,400 --> 02:05:26,912
To say some

2266
02:05:27,680 --> 02:05:28,960
But he never calls him out on

2267
02:05:29,216 --> 02:05:30,240
Actually respect the hello

2268
02:05:31,776 --> 02:05:32,288
Bill

2269
02:05:32,544 --> 02:05:33,568
By saying

2270
02:05:34,080 --> 02:05:34,848
We should arm

2271
02:05:36,384 --> 02:05:37,152
Is that

2272
02:05:37,920 --> 02:05:39,712
Precipitating Alex

2273
02:05:40,480 --> 02:05:41,248
Well they're crazy

2274
02:05:42,016 --> 02:05:43,296
Which is actually

2275
02:05:44,064 --> 02:05:44,576
Indicative

2276
02:05:46,112 --> 02:05:47,904
Some people shouldn't be allowed to have dry

2277
02:05:48,160 --> 02:05:50,976
Accidentally revealed on air

2278
02:05:51,232 --> 02:05:51,744
Through his

2279
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:52,512
Stupidity

2280
02:05:53,536 --> 02:05:54,304
I am his just be

2281
02:05:54,816 --> 02:05:59,424
Lulled into some sort of comfort

2282
02:05:59,680 --> 02:06:04,544
Yeah I don't forgot anything I made it I think I made it alright

2283
02:06:15,808 --> 02:06:17,088
Good Lord

2284
02:06:23,744 --> 02:06:26,816
90% of the homeless

2285
02:06:34,496 --> 02:06:40,640
Puerto Rico

2286
02:06:43,968 --> 02:06:45,760
Obviously

2287
02:06:48,576 --> 02:06:49,344
Homeless people

2288
02:07:02,912 --> 02:07:03,936
Boston

2289
02:07:04,192 --> 02:07:06,496
Shouldn't they get some help from the community

2290
02:07:06,752 --> 02:07:09,312
Shouldn't allow them to get treatment

2291
02:07:17,248 --> 02:07:18,272
God dammit

2292
02:07:19,040 --> 02:07:22,368
That's amazing

2293
02:07:23,904 --> 02:07:30,048
But at least he hasn't he has like 32 at least like

2294
02:07:31,072 --> 02:07:31,840

2295

Here is why fighting games

2296
02:07:34,400 --> 02:07:35,424
Will always

2297
02:07:35,680 --> 02:07:36,192
Have

2298
02:07:36,960 --> 02:07:37,728
Far greater

2299
02:07:39,008 --> 02:07:39,520
Truth

2300
02:07:40,032 --> 02:07:40,544
Witches

2301
02:07:41,056 --> 02:07:44,896
If somebody just pulls a Street Fighter combo on you like that

2302
02:07:45,152 --> 02:07:46,432
Hadouken

2303
02:07:46,688 --> 02:07:48,224
Die

2304
02:07:48,480 --> 02:07:53,344
Play the next match

2305
02:07:53,600 --> 02:07:55,648
Everybody knows you just got murdered

2306
02:07:55,904 --> 02:07:57,440
More like is it

2307
02:07:57,696 --> 02:07:59,232
That would be

2308
02:07:59,488 --> 02:08:00,768
It wouldn't be a cat would be like

2309
02:08:01,024 --> 02:08:01,792
Nice try

2310
02:08:02,048 --> 02:08:04,608
Stripes

2311
02:08:04,864 --> 02:08:07,168
Retail

2312
02:08:07,424 --> 02:08:12,288
Salad

2313
02:08:12,544 --> 02:08:14,336
And then revealed that he had no

2314
02:08:14,592 --> 02:08:16,128
Scan and then burned it

2315
02:08:16,384 --> 02:08:17,664
To the ground

2316
02:08:17,920 --> 02:08:18,688
That was

2317
02:08:20,224 --> 02:08:25,600
It starts with k more sexually attracted to a man

2318
02:08:25,856 --> 02:08:27,904
Vista Avenue three-year-old dude

2319
02:08:28,160 --> 02:08:33,280
God damn it I would make love to him immediately you don't want

2320
02:08:33,536 --> 02:08:35,328
I'm totally fine people having Guns Over

2321
02:08:36,864 --> 02:08:38,144
Feminism is more about their bill

2322
02:08:39,936 --> 02:08:41,728
Eagles space in economy

2323
02:08:44,800 --> 02:08:45,312
Homeless people

2324
02:08:45,568 --> 02:08:47,104
Alex being like let's not

2325
02:08:47,616 --> 02:08:49,152
Which also indicates that

2326
02:08:49,664 --> 02:08:52,736
Have the second amendment has limits

2327
02:08:52,992 --> 02:08:54,528
Argue against

2328
02:08:54,784 --> 02:08:56,064
Most of the time

2329
02:08:56,320 --> 02:08:57,600
I meant the idea of like

2330
02:08:57,856 --> 02:08:58,368
Hear music

2331
02:08:58,624 --> 02:08:59,136
That is a

2332
02:08:59,392 --> 02:09:01,440
Secondary ping pong

2333
02:09:01,696 --> 02:09:03,744

Tennis Pam

2337
02:09:12,448 --> 02:09:13,472

2339
02:09:17,056 --> 02:09:20,896
Cross-court forehand

2340
02:09:21,152 --> 02:09:23,456
No cuz that was a note

2341
02:09:23,968 --> 02:09:26,272
Minutes

2342
02:09:29,856 --> 02:09:36,000
45 lakh in a row

2343
02:09:36,256 --> 02:09:40,352
Dog at these to serve God

2344
02:09:40,608 --> 02:09:41,632
Alex just got murdered

2345
02:09:41,888 --> 02:09:42,912
Is the best

2346
02:09:43,680 --> 02:09:47,264
Alex does not really understand how bad he just got murdered

2347
02:09:48,288 --> 02:09:52,128
Adidas on a certain level

2348
02:09:56,224 --> 02:09:59,296
You realize he was beat

2349
02:09:59,552 --> 02:10:00,064
You don't

2350
02:10:00,320 --> 02:10:02,624
She does not know how much

2351
02:10:04,416 --> 02:10:05,440
Process pictures

2352
02:10:05,696 --> 02:10:07,232

02:10:09,024 --> 02:10:11,840
F****** ground or does he understand how deep

2354
02:10:12,096 --> 02:10:12,608
He's already

2355
02:10:15,680 --> 02:10:19,008
Is brutal

2356
02:10:19,264 --> 02:10:20,544
He's 6 Underground at least

2357
02:10:22,592 --> 02:10:23,872
Like this entire time

2358
02:10:25,664 --> 02:10:26,432
He's been trying to

2359
02:10:26,688 --> 02:10:28,224
Present the image that

2360
02:10:28,736 --> 02:10:30,016
Bellaire

2361
02:10:31,808 --> 02:10:34,112
Which we know from his label

2362
02:10:34,368 --> 02:10:36,928
Or his logo that is very similar to

2363
02:10:41,536 --> 02:10:42,048
Bye

2364
02:10:42,304 --> 02:10:43,584

Play a Communist Revolution

2368
02:11:08,416 --> 02:11:09,952
It's going to exhaust himself

2369
02:11:40,416 --> 02:11:46,560
You just basically admitted that its welfare system

2370
02:12:00,384 --> 02:12:01,408
I've been illiterate

2371
02:12:01,664 --> 02:12:06,528
Gotcha

2372
02:12:06,784 --> 02:12:08,064
If you read anything I've ever written

2373
02:12:09,344 --> 02:12:13,696
You know that's exactly right

2374
02:12:14,208 --> 02:12:16,512

02:12:19,072 --> 02:12:19,840
Want to have a conversation

2377
02:12:20,352 --> 02:12:21,120
Bill about

2378
02:12:22,144 --> 02:12:24,704
You should try and get him on

2379
02:12:24,960 --> 02:12:29,312
The Pitbull actually bet you could Brito

2380
02:12:29,568 --> 02:12:31,360
Send an email

2381
02:12:31,616 --> 02:12:32,896
Are you looking for

2382
02:12:34,944 --> 02:12:37,760
Schezo retired academic

2383
02:12:39,296 --> 02:12:45,440
I think that'd be great cuz I I would be interested in having a conversation about the pitfalls of a participant

2384
02:12:46,464 --> 02:12:48,256
Participatory democratic

2385
02:12:48,768 --> 02:12:49,536
Economics

2386
02:12:49,792 --> 02:12:50,304
System is well

2387
02:12:50,560 --> 02:12:54,912
Because that is not exactly an infallible system on its own

2388
02:12:55,168 --> 02:12:55,680
Like

2389
02:12:55,936 --> 02:12:57,216
All all I am

2390
02:12:57,728 --> 02:12:59,008
Light at the end of the day

2391
02:12:59,264 --> 02:13:00,288
I love watching Alec

2392
02:13:00,800 --> 02:13:03,360
But what I'm really interested in

2393
02:13:03,872 --> 02:13:06,176
Is talking to Bill about what's going on

2394
02:13:06,432 --> 02:13:08,224
Like he is a fascinating

2395
02:13:09,504 --> 02:13:10,016

02:13:10,272 --> 02:13:11,552
He's a brilliant guy

2397
02:13:11,808 --> 02:13:14,624
I wouldn't know a man I'm in love with belt

2398
02:13:14,880 --> 02:13:15,648

2399

2401
02:13:17,696 --> 02:13:18,720
Here's where you're going to learn

2402
02:13:20,256 --> 02:13:20,768
About

2403
02:13:21,280 --> 02:13:24,608
If you say he's a soft yes on white genocide I think we just made a match

2404
02:13:27,168 --> 02:13:31,520
Your girlfriend's position is

2405
02:13:31,776 --> 02:13:32,288
This next clip is

2406
02:13:32,544 --> 02:13:33,824

And then Alex

2409
02:13:41,248 --> 02:13:46,112
I wanted to find out if he had ever seen a film by Joel

02:13:46,368 --> 02:13:46,880
Gilbert

2411
02:13:47,392 --> 02:13:48,160
Who's the caller

2412
02:13:48,928 --> 02:13:55,072
Do I take on that

2413
02:13:55,328 --> 02:13:56,608
Filmon how did he feel about it

2414
02:13:59,424 --> 02:14:01,472
Frank Marshall Davis

2415
02:14:02,240 --> 02:14:05,824
I never knew Frank Marshall Davis I read about him in the New York Times

2416
02:14:19,648 --> 02:14:21,440
Alright well

2417
02:14:26,560 --> 02:14:29,120
Barack Obama

2418
02:14:29,376 --> 02:14:31,680
Alright

2419
02:14:34,752 --> 02:14:35,264
Alright

2420
02:14:36,544 --> 02:14:37,824
Also Dan

2421
02:14:38,592 --> 02:14:39,872
You never need to say

2422
02:14:41,408 --> 02:14:41,920
Ivan listen

2423
02:14:42,176 --> 02:14:43,456
To every show

2424
02:14:43,712 --> 02:14:44,992
That Alex has ever done

2425
02:14:45,760 --> 02:14:47,552
But anytime you have ever said

2426
02:14:47,808 --> 02:14:48,832
This is a caller

2427
02:14:49,344 --> 02:14:51,648
The accent gives it away every time

2428
02:14:51,904 --> 02:14:52,928
McDonald's

2429
02:14:53,184 --> 02:14:54,464
Regardless of what

2430
02:14:54,720 --> 02:14:56,512
Accent is somehow

2431
02:14:56,768 --> 02:14:58,816
Every accent that color has

02:15:05,472 --> 02:15:08,032
It has no consistency it is just

02:15:08,288 --> 02:15:10,336
Oh yeah

2436
02:15:11,104 --> 02:15:12,384

I can pick 6 out of

2439
02:15:17,248 --> 02:15:21,856
You would call a tour planning

2440
02:15:23,136 --> 02:15:25,440
Like this is a Louisiana

2441
02:15:30,048 --> 02:15:30,560

02:15:36,448 --> 02:15:36,960
There's just a

2446
02:15:37,216 --> 02:15:38,240

In people's voice

2450
02:15:43,616 --> 02:15:44,128
You can hear

2451
02:15:44,384 --> 02:15:44,896
Pothead

2452
02:15:45,152 --> 02:15:45,664
Someone's voice

I bought that you can tell when a person is fat by hot butter

2459

Like your ears like physical trait we're talkin about emotional traits

We're talkin about

2461

I understand that

2462
02:16:15,104 --> 02:16:16,384
The conversation

2463
02:16:16,640 --> 02:16:17,664
Then it's an emotion

2464
02:16:19,712 --> 02:16:20,224
I agree

2465
02:16:25,088 --> 02:16:27,136
