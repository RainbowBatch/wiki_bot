1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alexandra Thurston color

2
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:14,848
Indeed we are Dan

3
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:16,896
What's your favorite pepper

4
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:19,456
My favorite pepper is I mean right now

5
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:25,856
Habanero is strong in the pepper Camp I also have a Thai pepper plant that I

6
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:28,160
Gather the other day and

7
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:35,584
I bought it from a guy

8
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,168
I thought you were wandering around Chicago

9
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:46,336
Subscribers most likely

10
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:52,736
Hotter than habanero peppers but

11
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:55,296
I would like to

12
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:59,904
Ghost Pepper or you know like a scorpion

13
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,952
Grocery store

14
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:05,280
Do you need to order them from the places that make them where they need to be special

15
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:11,680
Hookah shop in Chicago like I don't think there's a good Pepper or

16
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:17,056
A good hot sauce store like there was tears of joy

17
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:22,432
But there's nothing like that here as best I can tell but if there is

18
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:25,248
So for now it's a habanero

19
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:27,040
It's great sprute

20
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:28,832
It's

21
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:30,368
Not spicy enough but

22
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:31,904
What do you why do you ask

23
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:35,488
This show

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,768
And this show

25
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:38,048
Has you

26
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:39,584
Knowing a lot about Alex

27
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,424
I know a lot about you tell me about Alex

28
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:44,704
And peppers

29
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:47,776
I am not

30
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:52,896
That sucks that I brought over on the 4th of July

31
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:59,296
I brought over a ghost pepper sauce

32
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:01,856
That is much too hot for a lot of people

33
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:06,976
Thank you put it straight up on your hot dog absolutely crazy

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,304
Crazy like crazy

35
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:19,520
Not your best transition not your best

36
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:25,664
Took it up to the next level

37
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,432
You so much

38
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,224
Kyle you are now a technocrat

39
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:35,392
I'm a policy wonk don't get mad and tell your brother someone sodomites

40
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:47,168
I don't want

41
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:53,568
Jesus Christ appreciate it very much if you would like

42
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,408
Refrigerator

43
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:59,712
Now I did call myself out about something

44
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:04,320
First of all this is the second time we tried to record the show

45
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:10,720
But that's why this is going to be saying this over again while Jordans

46
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:12,000
Already heard me say that

47
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:14,304
I'm terrible at internet

48
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,608
I'm bad at it

49
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,888
.

50
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:24,032
I'm good at doing this show but that's about it

51
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:24,800
End up

52
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,080
F****** up I f****** and

53
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,104
Better

54
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,456
Which is my way of saying that I am sorry to people who have written emails and have not got back

55
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,480
Somewhere it got infected

56
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:33,248
The late

57
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,296
I recognize that there are some people who

58
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:41,184
I just lost their emails and I have not remember to get ahold of you and if you send another email

59
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,720
And chastise me for it

60
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:46,048
I will own up to that and I will write you back

61
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:52,448
It will be a far better way for dance

62
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,472
Caucus first

63
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:55,008
And then say nice stuff

64
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:55,776
Will be

65
00:03:56,032 --> 00:04:02,176
Great at it but if you just feel s*** talking

66
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,368
Oh my God someone said something negative

67
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:12,672
Remarkable things I've

68
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:14,208
I got your almost like

69
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:14,976
Urine

70
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,280
And 7 months of doing this show like

71
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:20,863
The very limited negative

72
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,143
Crazy

73
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,423
But

74
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:28,799
Clear no one is like making me feel this way no one has been like

75
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,079
Hey you're a dick

76
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:33,151
You need to write back to people or anything like that this is just

77
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:37,247
My insecurities and buy recognition that I know I dropped the ball

78
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,343
I want to do better and better in the future because you all

79
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,879
Our listeners you deserve it

80
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:49,279
And you mean a lot to us and absolutely apologize that my own psychological impeachment

81
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,815
Get in the way of

82
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:53,375
Keeping up with that end of this

83
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:59,775
When we started this I have the same perception that I had of other podcast I've done in the past which is almost no one will listen

84
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:04,127
There'll be a few people reach out to me but it won't be that many

85
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:07,199
That were flooded with emails or anything like that

86
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:12,319
But it's more people sending messages that I've ever experienced messages of substance

87
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:18,207
It's not something where I can just sit there and be like haha good one

88
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:20,255
It's it's growing pains

89
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,303
And I know that I should have done this

90
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,583
Before this

91
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:26,143
Right considering we're this far into the show

92
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:29,471
But I'm going to try and do better and thank you for putting up with us

93
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:38,175
We never we never thought that more than fifteen or so people would ever actually listen to

94
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:44,575
Extension of us drinking at a bar yelling at each other

95
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:50,463
We didn't realize that aspect and we also didn't realize the aspect of like

96
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:53,279
I don't know what your feelings were entirely but like

97
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:55,071
I didn't realize that we would

98
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:57,887
Hit as much as we did like not terms of being

99
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:05,055
Actually interesting things that I didn't expect to find

100
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:09,663
We were just going to talk about a crazy person

101
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,991
I mean I was always hoping

102
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:18,623
But I didn't expect that the show would be anything more than entertainment

103
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:25,791
And then we go along when I call my God this means very weird

104
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:29,887
A level of circumstantial evidence

105
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:31,935
Never have considered existed

106
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:38,335
What a little bit would be the ones to find yourself crazy for assuming that at the beginning

107
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:41,151
Beginning everybody would have been like

108
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:44,223
Also I'm going to call myself out

109
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,271
If you have not received a button

110
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:48,575
I'm sure this is a part of my part to Austin

111
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:49,855
I am

112
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:52,671
Very good at sending those buttons

113
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:55,743
I am not good at making sure those button

114
00:06:55,999 --> 00:07:01,631
Get to where they need to go to USPS no it's not it's it's that I am

115
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:04,447
Unlike some sort of

116
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,775
Virginia

117
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:14,175
One of those other podcast hazardous.

118
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:18,271
Don't say their names

119
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:27,743
If you have reached out about getting a button and you have not gotten it

120
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:29,535
Whether or not

121
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:30,815
That's

122
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:33,631
You know whether or not that Postal Service

123
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,911
Or all our fault

124
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:37,983
Please get in touch with doesn't know what's right at gmail.com

125
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,519
We're going to make everything right

126
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,055
Where do better

127
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:46,687
I don't know why but man I feel bad about it

128
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:47,711
I don't know

129
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:51,039
General insecurity only compounds

130
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:53,599
Subway

131
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:56,671
Jordan today

132
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:02,303
On the first attempt at doing an episode I already explained my process has been

133
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,327
Terms of like

134
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,631
I got sidetracked on a bunch of weird

135
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:07,423
Sort of dead ends

136
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,983
In terms of that investigation

137
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:13,311
I have some stuff from 2009 that we're going to get to

138
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:16,383
I ran out of

139
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,407
Time today

140
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,711
In terms of presenting an episode

141
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,991
Until I forced it

142
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,039
Mayday

143
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,575
Bunch of bad clips

144
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:31,231
About Tucker Carlson

145
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:37,887
But then we continue going and we were both like to nail that five probably is

146
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:43,263
In 2012 Tucker Carlson was very clear that he hated Alex Jones

147
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,311
Alex's Show in 2014

148
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:49,407
And now in present-day Alex Jones says this

149
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:53,759
100percentpure Veritas hole-in-one

150
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,039
I've never done

151
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:03,487
Do you have this transformation over time and it did it follows the path of Tucker's career in

152
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,023
The fact that in 2012

153
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,351
Obama I had not one relaxed again in 2014

154
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,375
He was president

155
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:12,703
They had two more years to deal with it that I quite might as well make

156
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:19,103
Might as well but as we went through the episode became clear that like all the stuff you saying really isn't all that

157
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:25,503
Nothing it's just us being able to be like haha look hippocrate wait wait wait

158
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:30,367
About Obama's has being negative and now that Trump is doing it there like

159
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:33,951
Like it's over and over and over

160
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:35,999
These people have

161
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:37,279
No bottom

162
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:42,143
The first time I've ever done this in the middle of the episode

163
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:42,911
F*** this

164
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,703
Yeah I don't think

165
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:49,055
We've met did something after

166
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,335
3 minutes like we stopped

167
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,103
Because Dad

168
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:57,247
The vibe was off

169
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,527
But I've never

170
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:04,927
Control level is that I'd like to have that conversation

171
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:06,975
Skills

172
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:13,375
Worst 17 episode

173
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:21,055
I agree in a way that is not

174
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:22,847
Decorative swords

175
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:26,175
Messages from people

176
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:32,063
Bit like something that we did on our I would say 3rd

177
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:34,623
4th episode

178
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,671
And we were saying we were going to keep doing it

179
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:42,815
Call

180
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,607
Oh no

181
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:48,191
This game is I don't know what we're going to listen to

182
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:54,591
You don't know what we're going to listen to

183
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:59,967
Video from The Alex Jones Channel

184
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:06,367
See what we feel about it if it Sparks anything like as if this was a goddamn ask

185
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:13,791
This clip is doing the monologue

186
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:19,679
The first time we ended up accidentally getting a David Knight

187
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:23,519
California fires

188
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:28,127
For all of you who have ever wanted us to do in roulette again

189
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:32,735
The only thing I see

190
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:36,319
The reason that I was scanning through the top my eyes

191
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:40,927
Is because it says socialist in the title and I know that that probably means I was going to scream bunch

192
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,975
Capm socialist

193
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:45,279
Well I don't have the whole Title Here

194
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:48,095
Because it cuts off of I'm playing this from my phone

195
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:50,655
ABBA Dancing Queen

196
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,935
And there's a picture

197
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:56,031
Alexandria

198
00:11:56,287 --> 00:12:00,127
So I

199
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:02,175
And probably going to make Jordan very mad

200
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:02,943
Let's enjoy

201
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:12,415
Is the silent majority has a voice

202
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:16,255
So they have a new graphic that plays at the front

203
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,279
Just give a little contacts

204
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:23,167
Full title now that I've video is socialist beauty queen channels Miss South Carolina

205
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:26,239
Which if you were called Miss South Carolina

206
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:32,383
I thought it was it going to be before you said it was about a Alexandria

207
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:37,247
I was like I remember there being a like

208
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:40,831
Some pageant like Miss America where finally someone was like

209
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,647
F*** the patriarchy

210
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:45,695
Miss South Carolina was the one who stepped

211
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:47,231
Simard on stage was like

212
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:49,791
I believe education should

213
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,583
Wherewithal

214
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:57,983
Used random words in a sentence

215
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:00,799
Dodge the pageant winner

216
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:05,919
But the thoughts didn't connect clearly like

217
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:06,687
The coaching

218
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:10,271
I don't understand what I'm talking about but

219
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,807
I think this is going to make me sound

220
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:14,879
It was it was

221
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,415
I can tell already

222
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,463
Regardless of whose answer is here

223
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,231
They're going to

224
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:20,511
To try and connect her

225
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,815
Alligator attack

226
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,199
BoRics

227
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:45,087
You just said her name in the most boring he just said her name boring next clip

228
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,111
Next clip

229
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:49,695
Eclipse

230
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,487
Just the very next one

231
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,263
Infowars

232
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,055
Hershey's call Froggy

233
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,079
Location of airports

234
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,103
Ice office

235
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:08,383
Of the Border

236
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,735
We need to occupy every airport every

237
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:13,759
Border weenie dog

238
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:14,783
Dubai every ice officer

239
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:19,135
Goddamnit you're making

240
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,071
Border

241
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:33,983
You know what

242
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:41,151
Is a weird rationality put also a lot of a lot of folks on the last laugh

243
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:42,175
I do

244
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:42,943
Say

245
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,223
We don't want borders

246
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:46,271
I think I'm literally called for that in the path

247
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:52,927
I need a lot of people are much more comfortable saying it

248
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,999
Demilitarized zone

249
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:59,327
That implies violence

250
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:03,935
Take your time

251
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:13,151
Borders when the American Military was invading Mexico

252
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:17,503
It was a really good idea for them to make sure that there was a clear

253
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,783
So we didn't like

254
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:21,599
If we like we took Texas and they were like okay

255
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,367
Get out of here

256
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:24,159
And now we all regret that

257
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:25,951
We would prefer to give Tech

258
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:29,279
Just because that would be hilarious for all the texts

259
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:31,071
Citizen

260
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:39,263
Ben Alexander be Mexican propaganda

261
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:45,663
Do you think you turn nationalist for them definition

262
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,687
Navigate to Louisiana

263
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:48,479
Jordan

264
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:56,159
When would I go to work to do real quick

265
00:15:56,415 --> 00:16:00,255
3124

266
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:02,303
Jordan 24

267
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,863
My only platform is working

268
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:05,631
Back to Max

269
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:11,263
Billing of Texas

270
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,055
People say that I owned the 6th

271
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,079
I don't want to

272
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:16,383
You want

273
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,687
YouTube

274
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:19,967
I don't want it

275
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:23,039
You want

276
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:33,791
I Remember the Alamo as a colonial is b*******

277
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:41,727
For the Legacy that Alex Jones

278
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:42,751
So good

279
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:44,543
Let's get back

280
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,079
In order

281
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:46,847
To get

282
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:53,247
Regardless

283
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:57,855
The very dangerous

284
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,183
Saved

285
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,231
Call Londa

286
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,303
Patrol in America

287
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,567
Okay this is so boring

288
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,383
Open Safari

289
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:29,343
Terrifyingly boring

290
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:32,159
Unlike to stations in the country

291
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:34,719
A real

292
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:39,583
Like even though how many viewers

293
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,375
Thousand

294
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:45,215
Great

295
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:51,615
Not great for your Infowars Empire that's got hundreds of millions of listeners

296
00:17:54,431 --> 00:18:00,575
Facebook ad we could probably get to 9000 Cheese's okay so I'm going to switch up I'll write down

297
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:05,183
Any more of that cuz it's like the start of a

298
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:07,231
Maybe Define

299
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,767
It's not David

300
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:11,583
I hope

301
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:17,983
Alex has a manic energy deposit in your life

302
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,263
Know that this was going to happen

303
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:25,151
Buy something scrolled through and I I'll give you two off

304
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:28,735
What is a complete mystery I don't know who's hosting

305
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:34,367
Why is Robert Mueller targeting Rodger Stone

306
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:48,447
Why is Mueller Target

307
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:52,543
Or

308
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:55,615
Bearded Alex

309
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:58,175
Sitting in the makeshift secondary Studio

310
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:59,711
He's probably drunk

311
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:01,247
22 titles

312
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:04,831
Grab bag

313
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:07,135
Why is he targeting Rochester

314
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:09,439
What the f*** Congress

315
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:10,719
That's the title

316
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:14,047
Or 3

317
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:15,327
This is also Alex

318
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:19,423
Alex Jones epic reaction I've no idea what the reaction is to

319
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,495
I can't tell unless I click on the video

320
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:24,031
I don't like that that's

321
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:25,311
Mystery box

322
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:29,919
And if there's anything I know from watching game shows on Nick at night when I was five

323
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,991
You don't choose the Arab Electric

324
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:39,391
Never choose mystery boxes even further with

325
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:43,231
Says or at least whoever is doing it says it's an epic reaction

326
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:45,279
Which only sets us up for disappointment

327
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,559
Alright

328
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:49,119
Now we know

329
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,143
Yeah but we don't need

330
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:52,191
Not really

331
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:56,543
So now we've got what the f*** what the f*** Congress

332
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,311
With Alex

333
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,079
Or

334
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:59,103
Mystery host

335
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,895
Why is Mueller Target

336
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:04,479
Rogers Towne Cinema

337
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:05,247
I delayed

338
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,527
In Rodger Stone

339
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:08,063
Just his

340
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:11,391
But he's flare his eventual fall

341
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:21,119
Probably smart enough to steer clear of Rodger Stone defending clips

342
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:25,983
Alright then we got to go with what the f*** Congress

343
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:30,335
Alex Jones obviously the one that conspiracy theories

344
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,103
Theorist

345
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:33,151
Whose brand is bullying

346
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:34,943
Alex Jones is going to hear this is going to say

347
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:39,807
Why is CNN out to get made after the shooting

348
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:42,367
Alex Jones YouTube channel posted a video

349
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:45,951
That was seen by 2.3 million subscribers

350
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:46,975
Alleging that these

351
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:48,255
Merely

352
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:51,839
Actors and not Parkland

353
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:53,375
Who had experience

354
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:57,215
Horrific thing anyone could possibly imagine what happened with Infowars

355
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:58,239
Because they've made

356
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:01,567
Cottage industry out of this what they do is they deny

357
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:02,591
That these events

358
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:04,127
Why are they still on face

359
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,663
Do you recently decided

360
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:07,455
Not to ban Infowars

361
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:12,063
I don't like this already agree with Alex

362
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,855
Yeah

363
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:18,464
And I'm fine with that but I don't I don't like being in this clip

364
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,744
9 minutes

365
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,512
Okay

366
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:22,816
Scroll ahead 24 and a half

367
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:24,352
Let's just

368
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:30,752
Really

369
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:35,360
I want to start in the middle and then we're just going to try and reverse-engineer it

370
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,152
Buses from 4 minutes

371
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:38,432
22nd

372
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:39,200
S'mores.

373
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:39,968
Dot-com

374
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:43,552
He's able

375
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:49,184
It does not matter when you would have breastplate we would have immediately her to plug

376
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,464
Immediately

377
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:53,792
She knows

378
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,096
To use condoms

379
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:57,888
She said

380
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:02,240
Restraint

381
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,760
I just opened themselves up to

382
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:15,552
No

383
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,136

You know who I am your speciality

385
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:22,976
Channel videos

386
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:33,984
That violates our harassment policy

387
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:37,824
Which is not an act of aggression at all

388
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,592
That's like

389
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:40,384
Getting an email that says

390
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:46,784
You have violated the terms and conditions of working on book or whatever

391
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,064
The Parkland shooting

392
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,392
I mean granted we didn't want to talk about the immediate aftermath

393
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:53,696
Way to Rob

394
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:58,560
Even in the bad bike

395
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:04,448
David Hogg clearly wasn't at the school

396
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:07,776
Intentionally misrepresenting the timeline look like

397
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,104
The argument

398
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,384
Absolutely

399
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:18,784
No no

400
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,552

403
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,440
Cuz I'm the guy that won't sell out

404
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:28,000

Read defense

409
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:39,776
No idea

410
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:41,312
And you know that

411
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:55,392
I'm talking to

412
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:57,440
Put a video up

413
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,720

Posted this

417
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:11,264
I don't want to make a note

418
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:13,056
Crap on them

419
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:16,640
He's got four

420
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,968
On his own server

421
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:20,736
He's got his own

422
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,552
We aren't going to be able to take him down today

423
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:24,320
Stop it

424
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:27,392

427
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,072
Came to them with a

428
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:35,840
Legal

429
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:37,888
But instead

430
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:38,912
Dude

431
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:40,448
He's got 14 million people

432
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:41,472
You don't want to go up and

433
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:46,592
He claims

434
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:48,640
Which he usually does

435
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:50,176
Billions

436
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:51,200
Instead

437
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,992
This time he said

438
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:54,528
The accurate number

439
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:55,552
Which is at best

440
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,320
14 million

441
00:24:57,088 --> 00:25:00,160
I'm already and when I said I agree with him

442
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,952
I should clarify that

443
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:08,864
I don't think you should be I think we've already gone over this a little tight on Facebook

444
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,960
Do the kicked off Facebook part

445
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:17,824

What the f*** Congress

00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:28,064
Yeah but it turns out when you expand the flip it says

449
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,160
What the f*** Congress trying to get Infowars kicked off Facebook

450
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:33,184

What's the roulette into AAA in like a

453
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:49,568
We don't have a through line

454
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:53,152
Epic react

455
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:59,808
No I don't hate it but I do want to know what

456
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:00,832

00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:06,976
Optimistic

458
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:09,536

00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:23,360
Deceive people

465
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:26,176
But the end of this I'll show you a bunch of articles for USA Today

466
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,968
Says we're in a civil war

467
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:31,296
USA Today

00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:54,080
And I've been proven right continue

476
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:59,712
These are the people that on record the Democrats hate America

477
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:05,856
Bill Maher said they want to kill the economy

478
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:14,048

That's amazing cuz I took the over under for how long he makes it before the 1st Plaza

488
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:59,360
Distracted him

He doesn't show a video

507
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:05,152

00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,840
The Civil War would kill everybody

513
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:26,144
Shooting War

514
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,936
Demarcation line of them

515
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:29,216
Accelerate

516
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:34,336

Always

519
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:46,880
Stirred up

520
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:48,160
The fear

521
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:49,184
That is

522
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:52,000
Parallel to and

523
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:55,584
A natural takeover

524
00:29:56,864 --> 00:30:01,216
You can't pin me on saying that that's what this is what's going to happen

525
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:02,496
Heavily implied

526
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:06,592
Didn't say very much that said about the Civil War, and then

527
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:10,432
Videos

528
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:14,016
Play the Clippers

529
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:16,576
He did

530
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:18,368
Yeah he almost certainly did

531
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:21,696
What kind of idiot with a joke called reliable sources

532
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:22,464
Wouldn't

533
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:27,072
But what is it like we have unlimited time

534
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:28,608
In terms of our show

535
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:36,800
We can take a quick and we can listen to XM and talk about it for 10 minutes

536
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:38,848
Squishy to

537
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:43,200
Sponsors have commercials that got to go to they've got

538
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:46,272
Just do you have to have to if you can't do your whole show on Alex

539
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:52,672
So if they do a little segment on him obviously they're not going to play all the clips

540
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:54,720
Okay

541
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:56,512
We do have unlimited

542
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:58,304
Remember

543
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:04,704
Remember the Megyn Kelly interview when Alex was so terrified

544
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,544
What if

545
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:10,080
Is there a way for us

546
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:11,616
To do that can we find it

547
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:17,760
What network is that on Megyn Kelly

548
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:20,832
Who's on NBC I don't know I don't think anybody

549
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:23,136
Anybody anybody

550
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:27,744
But also I think it'll probably be like real Sirius Disclosure laws

551
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,024
In place like I think that

552
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:35,168
Wait I think you'll probably be a crime for the material disposal at least to write for SNL there on a PC

553
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:41,568
What is more high-profile

554
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:47,968
Some random rider for SNL walk

555
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:53,344
Recording for like 6 hours I get

556
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:58,720
One of those rare moments

557
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:00,768
That's where Alex like really showed ass

558
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:06,656
And that's why it would be interesting to know exactly what I want the whole thing

559
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:14,592
Show me the back to me I think we should for a minute let's be happy

560
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:16,384
So they went oh my God he's on.

Rob Reiner

564
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:26,880
What a leader of the last forever.

565
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:30,976
Are people referred Carl Reiner Bankhead

566
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:33,536
Uber driver throw people out all the rest

567
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:36,864
Director that you can argue

568
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,144
Stop Infowars

569
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:38,912
Abstract

570
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,984
You know these companies say they're working hard everyday

571
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:43,264
Stop the spread

572
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:46,592
Unreliable

573
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:49,408
One day this week I was at a press event

574
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:50,688
YouTube All About That

575
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:51,968
And the next day

576
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,528
Was it a Facebook event

577
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:56,576
Yeah simp

578
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,112
How can Facebook

579
00:32:58,624 --> 00:32:59,648
Serious about fighting missing

580
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:00,416
Information

581
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:02,976
I'm still at Infowars have a page with

582
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:04,512
Nearly 1 million followers

583
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:05,536
Okay posit

584
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:13,984
Okay that's a problem

585
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:26,272
Million followers

586
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:29,088
Speak now your argument is moot

587
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,112
Alright

588
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:33,184
Maybe we don't want Facebook to take off

589
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,464
Being forward page

590
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:38,048
On Facebook to take off 14 Infowars page

591
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:42,144
I still think I still think that it's the

592
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,984
I think it's the responsibility of the viewer I still think that

593
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,312
Because I think it's going to be impossible whatever guidelines

594
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:51,616
Could help with this whatever rules could help

595
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:52,384
Are going to

596
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,456
Be stymied by just implementation logistic

597
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:59,296
Like it's almost impossible the most narrowest and

598
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,856
Is what you're saying

599
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:04,928
Directly parallel to

600
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:06,720
It's so simple

601
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:09,536
It's really really simple I feel like I again

602
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:10,560
The cops

603
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:13,120
Institution

604
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:15,936
Except there should have been no no

605
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:22,336
They weren't around when it was written but also that I think that the problem was that

606
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:23,616
With your rule

607
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:24,640
It sounds

608
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,408
Good

609
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:28,480
It comes down to interpretation

610
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:35,136
Does any way too much like how do you actually enforce that sort of rule

611
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:41,536
Might not sound like Nazis to all grab a ton of girdles

612
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:43,072
Opaganda remove

613
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:44,096
Proper noun

614
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:50,752
If you're fitting in different proper nouns you just eternally same adjectives

615
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:58,176
You're crazy you're crazy

616
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:58,944
You're out

617
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:00,224
Look

618
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:06,624
On principle I agree with you I would love it that happen

619
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:13,024
Abused in a negative way I get it but I'm even think abused I think just the just the structural inability to deal with

620
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:15,584
The millions of posts that happen

621
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,608
Across

622
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:19,168
15 Channel

623
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:25,568
Who knows how many pages other outlets have like how many pages Breitbart has

624
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:32,480
You're going to run into trouble it's not going to work

625
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:34,528
It's not going to work but on the other hand

626
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:40,928
Your argument for people should be responsible for their own media consumption clearly failed

627
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:44,512
Because people are not responsible for it and they don't do a good job about it

628
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:46,560
Human beings are shity

629
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:50,656
Or at least an exploit

630
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:54,240
Pacific City Parts in order to further their own cause

631
00:35:54,752 --> 00:36:00,896
I would say an almost unsolvable problem unless we walk away

632
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:01,664
Walkaway

633
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:07,808
Madlib girdles social media

634
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:08,832
And I could

635
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:09,856
Exploit

636
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:10,880
Various

00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:11,904
Bruno Hot Topic

638
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,720
Pics of the day

639
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:15,744
And maybe

640
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:17,024
Retweets

641
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,048
Some stuff like that

642
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:18,816
But I don't want to be

643
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:19,840
I don't want to be a part of

644
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:21,888
I don't want to possibly get there

645
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:23,680
Social media

646
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:24,704
It's so dangerous

647
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,984
To me it's so weird

648
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:29,568
That like I restrain myself from out of

649
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:30,592
The fear that I might be

650
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:32,640
Someone somewhere

651
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:38,528
We should all walk away

652
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:42,880
She becomes how does anything exist without social media nowadays

653
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:43,904
Consider this

654
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:45,440
Get rid of tags

655
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:46,976
Interesting

656
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:49,024
Back to Mexico

657
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:53,376
From here on out that's my that I got two solutions

658
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:55,680
No no

659
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:02,592
Madlib madlib media blackout in Texas

660
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,016
Epic reaction

661
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:11,296
Was the

662
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:12,064
Start it over

663
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:16,160
That might have been what they were teasing

664
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:17,952
Whatever you end up doing

665
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:22,560
Just another weird hateful screed about Brian shelter

666
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:23,584
Hey just because

667
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:31,008
I went to the one that Trio of options that I wanted to go to now huh the service let's listen to a little bit of this

668
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:33,824
About Rodger Stone

669
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:35,360
Bulshit is Rodger

670
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:36,384
Yes

671
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:38,176
Loading slow but

672
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:39,456
God dammit

673
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:42,272
The freezer

674
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:43,552

By Mister Rosen Stein

679
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:55,072
To be remind

680
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:56,096
As I was

681
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:57,376
Was forced to remind

682
00:37:57,888 --> 00:37:58,400
Chris Cuomo

683
00:37:58,656 --> 00:37:59,168

On CNN

685
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:03,520
Isn't

686
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:04,288
Proven

687
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:06,080
Accusation by the government

688
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:09,152
An Undisputed fact

689
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,248
I have purchased are already

690
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:16,064
This is him

Vikram the traffic

692
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:20,928
This is

693
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:27,328
This is why you don't buy the mystery box I can't believe it the title of the clip is why Robert Mueller is tar

694
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:32,448
Marketing Rodger Stone and stone in a gray white

Infowars green screen

696
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:39,360
You can say

697
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:41,920
Guccifer 2.0 is a Russia

698
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:42,688
Should I say

699
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:45,248
How to say it

700
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:47,296
That does not make it a fact

701
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:53,696
Certified in a court know but there are a lot of other things but do make it affect

703
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:08,032
Rudy Giuliani Rodger Stone on Infowars

704
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:09,312
What

705
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:23,648
I would believe

706
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:26,464
I feel like I got to go back

707
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:35,424
Yeah you're right you're right

708
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:41,312
And there you have former mayor Rudy

709
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:42,080
Giuliani

710
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:53,600
I don't think there's any way that Rodger Stone would sit there with a

711
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:55,392
Straight face and say this is

712
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:57,952
Most effective lawyers

713
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:04,352
She would laugh about it and be like look at Rudy saying good things about me my friend

714
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:09,984
The pantheon

715
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:12,800

Religious

718
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:25,088
Okay well I will tell you the red-faced kickoff.

719
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,184
Here's a better question

720
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,464
To respond to that with

721
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,232
White

722
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:33,792
Wouldn't he though he's Rogers

723
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:35,328
This is a man

724
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:37,632
Who f****** balls to the walls

725
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:39,424
Because I think that

726
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:44,288
He would look like a Rube if he was pretending it was actually Rudy Giuliani when it wasn't

727
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:50,688
You would look like a Rube for believing that he actually believes

728
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:52,480
I'm so confused

729
00:40:54,272 --> 00:41:00,416
I'm so confused it's f****** good at what he does I'm so confused about this for a number of reasons the first

730
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:06,560
But I'm willing to entertainment

731
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:09,376
The second thing is that like

732
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:12,448
Did Giuliani for years because of his 911

733
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:15,776
Even in like in 2009

734
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:20,384
They play a commercial on every episode

735
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,408
Multiple times

736
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:27,040
9-11 documentary bermas might have made or sorry

737
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:30,624
With the clip of Rudy Giuliani saying

738
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,160
If you're not with us

739
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:38,048
You're with the terrorist commercial

740
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:42,656
Doctor documentary commercial now

741
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,496
I'm so confused but we haven't we haven't watch the show

742
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:49,056
Maybe he's explicated this in the past

743
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:54,943
Like maybe this is something that is your jokes from way back

744
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:56,223
I kind of think it's Frank

745
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:59,295
Frank Caliendo

00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:01,855

What are those

749
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:11,327
I can't. I just can't believe that Rudy Giuliani recorded a voice-over where he says

750
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:13,119
I'm the former mayor

751
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:15,167
The greatest mayor of New York

752
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:16,191
I believe that

753
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:22,591
100%

754
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:28,479
You're listening to Rodger Stone on Infowars

755
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:29,759
It would be easy enough

756
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:32,063
Get though you could just get that through a voice message

757
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:37,439
It's not like he has to come into studio and be like

758
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:38,975
Alright

759
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:43,071
Sibilance

760
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:47,167
Zero effort

761
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:48,703
That f****** like

762
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:49,983
Let's juice this

763
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:51,519
It was actually Rodger

764
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:52,543
Just don't doing the boyfriend

765
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:59,199
What if it turns out he's a good impressionist

766
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:02,271
Is a brilliant

767
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:03,807
All of these voices

768
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:06,367
Alex Jones

769
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:07,391
No he

770
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:09,695
Makeup can do that

771
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:14,815
I think I think it's possible he's Eddie Murphy in the club

772
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:16,607
I would believe that

773
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,399
Possibly Owen Shroyer

774
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:20,703
Alex no absolutely not

775
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:28,383
I don't know whatever

776
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:33,503
This is probably the least important

777
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:36,575
If there's anything that we can take from this clip

778
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:37,855
Is that right

779
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:38,879
Notify

780
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:39,903
And he's

781
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:44,255
Really trying to do cuz he's not doing damage control for his real life

782
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:47,071
He's doing damage control for his Infowars

783
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:50,911
Like he's going through all this he knows what he's saying is

784
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:53,471
He knows that when he was in that

785
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:54,495
Batman

786
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:55,519
Because again

787
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:56,543
That indictment

788
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:58,335
Fantasy

789
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:01,919
Those those people are in Aldo Nova

790
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:03,455
Never coming to Justice

791
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:04,735
If there is

792
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:10,367
There's no chance of them actually facing the consequences

793
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:12,927
Further action bright the point of that

794
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:13,695
Is

795
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:15,999
To make sure everybody knows

796
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:17,791
There was an American

797
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:24,191
Who acted as an intermediary with Lee Stranahan to came up

798
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:26,495
About Rodger Stone

799
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:30,591
Just because Rodger Stone foolishly leaked

800
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:31,871
His own messages

801
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:33,919
MMA word to word the message

802
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:35,455
Just that were in that indictments

803
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:37,503
I do think that I do think that is

804
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:38,271
A message

805
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:40,063
On some on some leather

806
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:41,087
Indian

807
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:47,231
You're right you're right every there is no there's no way this is ever going to actually go to court unless they try them in a

808
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:48,511
Absentia

809
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:51,327
Going to happen

810
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:56,703
But at the same time Rogersville thing about like they can just say whatever they wanted don't prove it

811
00:44:57,215 --> 00:45:02,591
A lot of facts very specific information

812
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:03,615
Like if you

813
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:05,151
Now

814
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:06,687
Since you're a journalist

815
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:09,247
Apparently on Infowars

816
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:10,527
Now it is your job

817
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:14,367
To take the information in that indictment the address

818
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:15,391
Is the server

819
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:20,255
One point

820
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:21,791
Employee relationship

821
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:22,815
That are laid out

822
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:24,095
All that

823
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:24,863
You can find

824
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:26,143
And a Fulton

825
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:27,167
Then

826
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:28,959
You get to critique

827
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:30,239
The information given

828
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:33,055
Let's find out if you find the fault

829
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:34,591
The president

830
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:36,895
Defense and

831
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:37,663
An offense

832
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:38,943
And calling out

833
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:40,223
The criminality

834
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:40,991
Of James

835
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:41,759
Call me

836
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:43,807
Robert Mueller and the other

837
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:45,087
Deep state

838
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:49,695
Who operate without any kind of

839
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:50,719
Whatsoever

840
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:54,303
Answering only to the Twitter

841
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:55,327
Rosenstein

842
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:57,119
Mr. Rosenstein

843
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:58,143
Mine is the man

844
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:01,727
Intentional

845
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:02,495
That was

846
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:06,079
To spy on the Trump campaign

847
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:07,103
Alright

848
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:10,175
I'm wondering

849
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:11,199
Right now

850
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:12,735
If he is address

851
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:19,135
Any of the real real accusations against him right so far no he's only said

852
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:25,535
The only thing that he's actually said Trump in Helsinki talking about the server the only thing the only thing he said is that

853
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:26,815
Guccifer 2.0

854
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:29,119
You can't prove is a Russian

855
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:30,911
Agent

856
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:33,215
That absolutely been proved it

857
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:33,983
Like

858
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:35,263
Scientifically

859
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:36,031
Using

860
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:43,711
Shirt not in the court of law but the preponderance of evidence is certainly public now

861
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:46,783
Wasn't even it wasn't even a preponderance of

862
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:53,183
Evans it was actually really really well hidden until the guy who is running

863
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:55,743
Didn't log into the VPN

864
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:58,815
And all the sudden now we have a direct

865
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:00,095
121 connect

866
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:01,887
And that incontrovertible

867
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:04,447
Right

868
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:05,215
Servers

869
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:08,543
No I give

870
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:13,919
And I would never fun

871
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:14,687
Like

872
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:16,479
This is a surprising thing for me to say

873
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:19,551
I think Rodger Stone

874
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:20,831
Oh

875
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:21,855
You don't say

876
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:23,391
That

877
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:25,183
Mister Rosen

878
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:26,463
Who's dying

879
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:27,999
Be prosecuted

880
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:30,047
This is just about

881
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:30,815
Beginning

882
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:31,839
Also just

883
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:32,863
They weren't spying

884
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:43,871
Outer indictment

885
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:53,599
Supposed is he stupid

886
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:58,463
Yeah but he's he's read the writing on the wall

887
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:01,279
Still smells to me like Saving Face

888
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:03,839
Seem like someone who's scared

889
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:05,631
And I think the reason again

890
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:06,399
That I keep saying

891
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:07,167
I think

892
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:08,703
Cut it.

893
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:10,239
Let's see if he's

894
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:12,543
Auburn Epic

895
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:13,311
Clash

896
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:14,847
Ladies and gentlemen

897
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:17,151
But anyway

898
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:18,431
The indict

899
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:19,711
Laid out

900
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:21,759
Last week by mr. Rose

901
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:24,319
Remind

902
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:26,367
Did as I was forced to remind

903
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:27,647
Chris Cuomo

904
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:28,415
The other night

905
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:29,695
On CNN

906
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:30,975
And indict

907
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:33,535
Isn't

908
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:35,327
By the government

909
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:36,607
It is not

910
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:38,399
An Undisputed fact

911
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:43,519
Generally it requires

912
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:48,383
To bring the indictment the first Warren

913
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:54,783
We already heard that a second ago cuz it's from the sizzle reel that they put before

914
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:57,855
Rudy Giuliani real or fake dropping in

915
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:00,159
You can say

916
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:03,487
Guccifer 2.0 is a Russian asset

917
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:06,047
As many as you want to say it

918
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:10,399
Certified in a port

919
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:16,031
Questions

920
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:18,847
I feel like that's not a denial.

921
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:19,871
As a witness

922
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:20,895
The former

923
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:23,967
Counterintelligence ITF

924
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:30,367
To prove definitively

925
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:34,463
Guccifer 2.0

926
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:36,767
Is indisputable a Russian

927
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:39,839
Exactly

928
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:46,239
It is amazing.

929
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:48,287
Screamin Mimi's the Box

930
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:49,055
Sis.

931
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:50,591
Daily Beast

932
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:51,615
And the other

933
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:53,663
Garbage media such as

934
00:49:54,431 --> 00:50:00,575
That you can't cuz I'm playing answer my phone you don't see the video

935
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:03,903
Single close

936
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:09,535
Speaking directly to a wrestling promo

937
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:15,935
Slightly more details unless I'm going to kick your ass at the Coliseum

938
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:17,471
I don't think we're going to get much out of this

939
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:21,567
Here's the thing

940
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:30,783
What has never hosted his own show

941
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:33,343
Rodger Stone pick this up

942
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:38,463
Radio if the stones

943
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:41,791
What is yoke of the stone Zone

944
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:43,071
Refuse

945
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:47,167
No I'm no I know

946
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:54,591
Used to believe I know a guy who is kind of like a co-host

947
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:55,615
Of his show

948
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:59,711
I don't want to ask him about it but I'm worried because he was his co-host I don't

949
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:02,015
Edit music

950
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:03,807
This comedian named Travis Irvine

951
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:07,391
And who came to Chicago couple times I did some shows

952
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:08,671
Really cool dude

953
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:13,023
It was really fun to hang out with you run for like a libertarian

954
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:14,559
The office

955
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:15,583
In the past

956
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:17,375
So I'm thinking I did

957
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:19,679
Too crazy about that

958
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:22,239
Didn't suss out any

959
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:23,519
You might be friends with

960
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:24,543
Rodger Stone

961
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:30,943
We hang out

962
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:37,343
But then like when I was looking through Rogers like

963
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:38,879
Shows that he's Donna like

964
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:40,927
What the

965
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:45,023
Wait time is it on again what the f***

966
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:46,559
Do you Donuts on Rogers

967
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:51,679
It might be a little late

968
00:51:56,031 --> 00:52:00,895
I want to give out information now I would like to pretend this didn't happen and go back to my

969
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:05,759
Ninja Turtles Ninja Turtles

970
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:15,743
But it's super weird like that that sort of

971
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:17,279
I think that's the closest

972
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:19,583
I have to Alex other than like

973
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:24,703
You know a couple of people who contacted me with like I know him or he has met him

974
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:25,983
But like the someone

975
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:27,519
Someone who has done

976
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:29,311
Multiple radio shows

977
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:30,847
With Rodger Stone

978
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:33,919
Who I have hung out drinking with and like

979
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:36,991
I have his number for knowledge

980
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:40,063
This is what you were always meant to do

981
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:41,855
Okay

982
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:44,415
Most alt right

983
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:45,183
Call Travis

984
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:46,463
Most all right

985
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:47,999
But and right

986
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:50,047
Male pundits

987
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:53,119
I guarantee at least

988
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:54,655
I will posit you

989
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:56,191
That Rodger Stone

990
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:57,983
Has at least done a few Open my

991
00:52:58,751 --> 00:52:59,263
Oh yeah

992
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:01,567
They're all veiled chameleon

993
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:07,455
They just they're just all comedy and they realize that the right-wing doesn't understand,

994
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:08,479
So they try

995
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:09,759
Whether or not

996
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:11,295
Rodger has done open

997
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:12,319
I want

998
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:13,343
To say that I don't

999
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:14,111
Travis

1000
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:15,135
The failed

1001
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:21,791
Comedia very good at I'm not talking about you

1002
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:26,655
Please dude in the world

1003
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:33,055
Like they're all terrible stand-up who have pivoted into something else

1004
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:39,455
We're like we don't have any talent to pull myself out I mean failed stand-up

1005
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:41,247
Bye

1006
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:46,623
Stand-up I reached the point where I felt

1007
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:51,487
This is about as good as I can do and then I also didn't enjoy it anymore.

1008
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:59,167
I reach that point three years ago and I'm still just trying to make get good mob work though

1009
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:06,335
I watched you out at the Zanies

1010
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:07,103
He's when I came out

1011
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:08,639
You hosting

1012
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:11,455
I saw frustration

1013
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:13,503
In your face I saw

1014
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:19,903
Almost I don't want that I saw a touch of I don't want to do this

1015
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:26,303
It was still you do your job and being funny you're being funny and keeping the show

1016
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:27,327
Running along and all that

1017
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:29,119
And I couldn't do that

1018
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:30,399
I couldn't do that anymore

1019
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:32,191
There's no there's no

1020
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:34,239
Even in my greatest days I don't think I could have done

1021
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:35,263
United

1022
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:37,567
I'm a driver man I'm going to get it done

1023
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:41,663
I'm not a good host I have a I have a responsibility

1024
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:43,455
As a paper fessional

1025
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:46,271
I respect that

1026
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:47,807
I think you do a great job

1027
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:54,207
Let's go to this next question I don't know what it is

1028
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:59,327
So this is what I scroll down a little bit the only thing I know is that

1029
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:01,887
On my phone it says proud boy Rufio

1030
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:09,823
Also

1031
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:10,591
Did you know that

1032
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:13,151
The guy who played Rufio

1033
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:14,687
Was also The Voice

1034
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:22,367
The Last Airbender

1035
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:27,999
He's the voice of Zuko that's the same guy did you know that that was awesome also

1036
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:32,095
Also in Legend of Korra

1037
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:34,399
The trivia I was going to go with

1038
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:40,031
Who is the grandson of General iroh

1039
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:43,615
Do you know idea The Last Airbender

1040
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:49,759
Is it the guy who played Rufio

1041
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:52,575
But he was also in a Christian extreme

1042
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:53,855
Sports movie called

1043
00:55:54,111 --> 00:55:54,879
Extreme days

1044
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:57,695
What is it

1045
00:55:57,951 --> 00:56:03,839
Terrible but me and my buddy saw it in the theaters yet we thought it

1046
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:07,679
You're like no boarding and what have you know but it was

1047
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:08,447
Who is Derek's

1048
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:10,239
Stream days

1049
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:12,543
Extreme love of God

1050
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:13,823
Parable

1051
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:14,847
But me and my buddies

1052
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:17,151
Nikki gift I believe was there

1053
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:20,735
My my old Columbia Missouri buddies worth

1054
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:22,271
And we all lost our

1055
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:23,551
F****** s***

1056
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:29,951
There was crazy and the movies terrible one of our friends through and in

1057
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:36,351
Tire large Mountain Dew with the screen like we were out of control but

1058
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:42,495
Weird Christian undertone to it

1059
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:46,847
I freaked out because they had a

1060
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:49,151
Car that they called their Joy Yoda

1061
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:52,479
Is a Toyota but it was still full of God's joy

1062
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:57,855
I actually love

1063
00:56:58,111 --> 00:57:03,743
Pam to the back bumper and I had made it a joy odense Toyota put that on a

1064
00:57:04,511 --> 00:57:05,023
It was like

1065
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:06,559
Yeah alright you guys

1066
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:10,143
Someone in set design did half-an-hour at work

1067
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:15,519
I realize that now but it's times like crazy

1068
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:17,055
I've never

1069
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:18,079
Never

1070
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:19,615
Consider that portmanteau

1071
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:21,663
Emgeneral

1072
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:23,711
Two things one

1073
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:25,503
Toyotas don't bring people

1074
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:29,855
I am not a very creative person

1075
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:34,975
5-minute talk about various things that the guy who played Rufio did

1076
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:41,375
Everybody's leaving who have not seen avatar The Last Airbender

1077
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:43,167
Get on it

1078
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:49,567
Completely skipped over the other part of it that he's a proud boy

1079
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:54,943
Rufio is the proud boy

1080
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:59,295
Somebody's been on that name I'm sitting

1081
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:03,903
I'm taking from we're not saying that there is a family

1082
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:05,951
That was born in the 90s

1083
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:07,743
Born in the early 80s

1084
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:11,583
And then decided when we have a kid

1085
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:13,887
What else can we call it but Rufio

1086
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:15,167
It's not his given name

1087
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:18,239
I'm certain I'd let's find out

1088
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:20,799
Anyway probably suck let's see what have

1089
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:23,103
Cowboys

1090
00:58:24,383 --> 00:58:24,895
I've been hit with

1091
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:26,943
Clubs and stuff on my hands and so

1092
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:28,223
You know

1093
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:32,063
Going full power obviously in defense is sometimes

1094
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:33,343
Makes you vulnerable but

1095
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:35,647
You know I did the best I could and

1096
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:44,095
The governor

1097
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:46,911
It's just awesome

1098
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:50,239
So neither of these guys have ever been

1099
00:58:56,127 --> 00:58:57,919
So

1100
00:58:58,175 --> 00:58:59,455
Rufio Rufio

1101
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:02,527
Damn man which I assume

1102
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:09,951
Stickman

1103
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:20,447
Bluefin was it blinking and start of Damon Wayans not David Alan Grier

1104
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:21,215
Debatable

1105
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:23,775
David Alan Grier

1106
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:25,055
Supporting actor

1107
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:30,943
Why he didn't get a Best Supporting Actor nominee I will never understand

1108
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:32,223
That's what I say

1109
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:35,551
So

1110
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:36,575
Flights

1111
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:39,135
Sidebar

1112
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:42,207
Have you ever seen cheap seats

1113
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:47,583
The brothers mst3k

1114
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:50,655
So they did one episode

1115
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:51,935
With the host

1116
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:53,983
Competition

1117
00:59:54,495 --> 00:59:58,591
Because you're so much energy

1118
00:59:59,615 --> 01:00:05,247
Who do not have been there at

1119
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:06,783
One of my favorite things

1120
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:08,831
Early Loveline

1121
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:11,135
I would hate to revisit a lot of it

1122
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:15,999
So listening to those episodes when David Alan Grier would come in

1123
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:16,767
Like

1124
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:18,815
It was revolutionary

1125
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:21,119
This person is crazy

1126
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:23,167
Add just ripping his ass off

1127
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:26,751
But like

1128
01:00:27,007 --> 01:00:29,567
Somehow

1129
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:30,847
Underrated

1130
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:33,663
If you actually listen to it

1131
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:34,687
Layover Ray

1132
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:35,967
It's bananas

1133
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:37,759
That is a

1134
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:44,159
Set an alarm for

1135
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:44,927
Don't know

1136
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:48,255
He's been with Delta Burke underrated

1137
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:53,119
April left also

1138
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:55,167
It's banana

1139
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:57,727
Feel like I might just get some rest and love him

1140
01:00:59,007 --> 01:01:00,543
With the reason that I pause this

1141
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:01,311
As

1142
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:02,591
Either we got off on a tag thing

1143
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:05,151
As you do

1144
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:06,175
We have

1145
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:16,927
Describe here and Alex Jones

1146
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:21,791
Trying to relay like a governor

1147
01:01:22,047 --> 01:01:22,815
Search is Over

1148
01:01:24,095 --> 01:01:26,399
Swoll 20 something year old dude

1149
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:27,679
Didn't like he's

1150
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:28,703
Dislike

1151
01:01:28,959 --> 01:01:35,103
Like casual as f*** like at a bar like he's got his arm on Alex's table if I get

1152
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:41,503
Posture of like I don't give a f*** the s*** I know this is what you want me to

1153
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:45,599
You have Alex looking over at him

1154
01:01:46,111 --> 01:01:50,975
Like almost an admiration

1155
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:53,791
Exactly how I feel like

1156
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:55,583
Only in the sizzle reel here

1157
01:01:56,095 --> 01:01:59,423
Again before we get to but I hope it's another Rudy Giuliani drop

1158
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:06,079
Oh yeah

1159
01:02:06,847 --> 01:02:11,711
Yeah yeah you know everything happen naturally inorganic be there

1160
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:12,991
Going to hit you

1161
01:02:18,623 --> 01:02:19,391
Yep there you go

1162
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:20,415
The sunglasses

1163
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:21,951
The stuff

1164
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:28,863
Hold on

1165
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:30,399
I just watched that video

1166
01:02:30,911 --> 01:02:33,215
That he played it was

1167
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:35,007
Rufio panman

1168
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:36,031
Punching a dude

1169
01:02:36,287 --> 01:02:40,895
Followed through there was another woman

1170
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:44,479
Maybe four feet from the person he just punched

1171
01:02:44,991 --> 01:02:46,015
And he doesn't punch her

1172
01:02:46,527 --> 01:02:48,063
I don't I don't know how

1173
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:50,367
You don't also punch her

1174
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:53,439
Inertia

1175
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:55,487
I'm going to go with a lot of different reasons

1176
01:02:55,743 --> 01:02:57,279
First and foremost

1177
01:02:57,791 --> 01:02:58,815
The biggest problem here

1178
01:02:59,327 --> 01:03:00,095
Is Alex

1179
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:01,887
Delighted

1180
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:03,423
Buy the idea that

1181
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:04,959
He should have hit her

1182
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:07,519
Wants to hit a woman

1183
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:14,943
You get rid of socialism in women

1184
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:15,967
You smack him down

1185
01:03:16,991 --> 01:03:17,759
That's just

1186
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:19,807
History Bell it's only watch the first

1187
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:20,575
3 minutes of

1188
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:24,159
Smack My b**** Up Video is that correct

1189
01:03:24,671 --> 01:03:26,207
Didn't get to the reveal nailed it

1190
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:27,999
Country meats

1191
01:03:28,255 --> 01:03:29,535
Trying to get

1192
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:34,655
The female you know and she wasn't wearing a mask so that was

1193
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:35,679
Instantly my

1194
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:37,983
My thought was the case she's not an immediate threat

1195
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:41,567
Gentleman if she decides to be aggressive with me

1196
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:48,223
And then my folks became on grabbing that baton that went to the ground and in complicating that weapon

1197
01:03:50,783 --> 01:03:51,807
Infowars logo

1198
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:52,831
So

1199
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:53,599
His

1200
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:55,135
His basic point

1201
01:03:56,927 --> 01:03:57,439
He was doing

1202
01:03:57,695 --> 01:03:59,487
A situational analysis

1203
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:01,535
Wilt in the middle of a punch

1204
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:04,607
But he was like he was

1205
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:10,751
Junior in Sherlock you know what time slow down bullet time when you're out there fighting

1206
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:16,639
I am going to

1207
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:18,943
Program confiscate button

1208
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:19,711
Action

1209
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:23,295
To the knee

1210
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:28,159
His Livery swollen crab

1211
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:30,207
Watch out there's a lady

1212
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:31,231
So stupid

1213
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:31,999
Wow

1214
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:34,303
Problem

1215
01:04:34,815 --> 01:04:36,351
I don't think either of them

1216
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:37,631
Really

1217
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:38,911
Unhappy with the

1218
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:40,447
Idea of punching

1219
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:43,519
There is

1220
01:04:43,775 --> 01:04:47,359
Slightly different like let's say she was wearing mask

1221
01:04:59,135 --> 01:05:00,159
How many women has Alex

1222
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:02,207
I know that

1223
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:05,791
Made a bunch of abortions

1224
01:05:06,047 --> 01:05:07,071
They didn't want

1225
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:10,655
I don't know if that's the equivalent of hitting but I know it's not great maybe

1226
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:11,423
I don't know

1227
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:18,079
I don't like how he said my baby right there

1228
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:18,847
The proud boys

1229
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:30,623
If you just joined us going out in

1230
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:38,815
Forgot

1231
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:42,655
Walking these guys out so maybe during the break and tell the crew to find those I've seen him

1232
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:49,055
38 you just replay the exact same video of him

1233
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:54,943
They're in and out it doesn't appear it it's not it's not Africa

1234
01:05:55,199 --> 01:06:01,343
Like this is not it does not appear to be a crowded melee it's just he's punching

1235
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:05,695
Here is I don't know the circumstances of it so I can't comment on that

1236
01:06:05,951 --> 01:06:06,975
Pain

1237
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:08,255
Alright

1238
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:09,791
First thought

1239
01:06:10,047 --> 01:06:14,911
That we hear from the the best of clipper the sizzle reel is him

1240
01:06:15,167 --> 01:06:15,679
Dang

1241
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:17,983
I don't know how you didn't

1242
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:19,775
Cuz I would have given that woman

1243
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:23,871
That makes me sick as hell

1244
01:06:24,127 --> 01:06:24,895
Next.

1245
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:27,967
We saw them hitting women and children

1246
01:06:28,991 --> 01:06:30,527
That's an interesting

1247
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:31,807
Yeah that stuff

1248
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:35,647
That's tough.

1249
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:38,719
I would say I would even go so far as to

1250
01:06:38,975 --> 01:06:39,487
To say

1251
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:43,327
That means he likes hitting women it's it's

1252
01:06:45,631 --> 01:06:48,447
Only because we know that his narratives aren't true

1253
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:51,775
Rolex is doing

1254
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:54,079
Is doing

1255
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:55,871
Isn't isn't real

1256
01:06:56,127 --> 01:06:57,663
Computer that justifies

1257
01:06:57,919 --> 01:07:02,527
Is the behavior like Rufio

1258
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:05,087
Just like so many gun people

1259
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:05,855
He he he

1260
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:08,415
Fantasy about Justified

1261
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:10,975
You're a good man with a pan

1262
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:14,559
To shoot somebody or hit them with a pan but he needs to do it

1263
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:15,327
Self-defense

1264
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:16,095
So it's just a

1265
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:22,751
So you say you want to hear more about bayspan man or do you want to move on

1266
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:29,151
We got you don't want you know what this week

1267
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:30,431
Linda crying

1268
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:31,967
The idea of hitting with

1269
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:38,367
That's all you're really going to get out of it

1270
01:07:39,903 --> 01:07:41,695
Jesus

1271
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:44,511

01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:02,591
The Bundys

1293
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:05,663
They said

1294
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:06,687
Shut up

1295
01:09:07,967 --> 01:09:08,479
Publix

People like the hammer

Boring

1299
01:09:15,647 --> 01:09:16,159
Increasingly is that

01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:44,063
People on Rikers Island no no

1310
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:49,951
Which is I guess I know probably slang that mean

1311
01:09:50,463 --> 01:09:54,303
No that means

1312
01:09:58,399 --> 01:10:02,495
Greg Weidman

1313
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:05,567
Things they wouldn't allowed you on here

1314
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:07,359
Alright alright

1315
01:10:08,383 --> 01:10:11,455
It's giving me like 30 more 30 seconds

1316
01:10:11,711 --> 01:10:12,223
Situation

1317
01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:13,247
How they came after

1318
01:10:13,759 --> 01:10:14,271
Is marijuana

1319
01:10:14,527 --> 01:10:15,039
Activist

1320
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:16,831
Cool in jail

1321
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:17,599
Without fail

1322
01:10:18,111 --> 01:10:18,879
Saying that was part

1323
01:10:19,135 --> 01:10:20,415
Of the New Jersey

1324
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:22,463
His bail

1325
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:27,071
Yeah

1326
01:10:27,327 --> 01:10:29,375
I'm fine with that he's not going to make that argument

1327
01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:30,655
They always

1328
01:10:30,911 --> 01:10:32,447
But every time we agree with them

1329
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:33,983
They always make an argument

1330
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:36,543
That they don't realize they're making

1331
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:39,103
Veirs f******

1332
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:45,759
It's like that it's like there's there so hard right that go to the other side

1333
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:50,367
Truth in that

1334
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:52,159
That's early Act

1335
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:53,951
A lot of people

1336
01:10:54,463 --> 01:10:57,023
I believe that the further you go right the closer you get

1337
01:10:57,791 --> 01:10:59,839
The farthest end of the last

1338
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:03,167
Interesting I don't know if that's true but I do know that

1339
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:05,471
Based on the way the propaganda works

1340
01:11:05,727 --> 01:11:08,543
Even if you are a spiritual

1341
01:11:08,799 --> 01:11:11,359
With people on the hard life when you're on the hard right

1342
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:13,663
You're still going to be like no I'm not

1343
01:11:14,175 --> 01:11:15,967
Are you still going to like

1344
01:11:16,479 --> 01:11:17,503
Kind towards

1345
01:11:18,015 --> 01:11:20,575
Something closer yet

1346
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:24,415
I thought

1347
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:29,279
Now that was never going to happen

1348
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:35,167
Very excited

1349
01:11:35,423 --> 01:11:37,471
Everyone dies

1350
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:39,775
Everyone dies it's the worst thing in the world

1351
01:11:41,055 --> 01:11:41,823
Okay alright

1352
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:44,127
I'm very

1353
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:45,151
To deceive this clip

1354
01:11:46,175 --> 01:11:52,319
I don't know what this is going to be about about Sacha Baron Cohen

1355
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:57,183
Who is now really recent that

1356
01:11:57,439 --> 01:11:59,743
A couple days

1357
01:11:59,999 --> 01:12:06,143
I can scroll through that far back on my phone

1358
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:08,191
You search Alex Jones you get the Great

1359
01:12:08,447 --> 01:12:14,591

1360

Searching you're just going to the channel and then slide okay

1361
01:12:20,991 --> 01:12:23,039

1362
01:12:23,295 --> 01:12:24,319
Okay

1363
01:12:25,087 --> 01:12:29,951
He doesn't know in the last week or so Sacha Baron Cohen

1364
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:34,815
Put out his new documentary

1365
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:41,215
Which we are America who is America a commercial for it came out

1366
01:12:41,471 --> 01:12:42,751
Everyone who got stuck

I'm parked by it came out in droves being like hey

1368
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:52,735
I got IO they trick me into saying things I didn't mean to say

1369
01:12:59,135 --> 01:13:05,279
Bernie Sanders and interviews with him

1370
01:13:05,535 --> 01:13:06,559
Watch that I watched

1371
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:10,143
The clips that

1372
01:13:13,727 --> 01:13:14,495
Is it soon as I can

1373
01:13:14,751 --> 01:13:16,031
Check this order thing is very hilarious

1374
01:13:16,287 --> 01:13:17,823
I don't I don't

1375
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:20,895
Bernie Sanders got tricked by

1376
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:22,431
Someone who was dumb

1377
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:24,223
Evan Bernie was very polite

1378
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:26,015
I tried to talk to him

1379
01:13:26,271 --> 01:13:28,831
Marysville

1380
01:13:29,599 --> 01:13:31,647
With people like our friend

1381
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:38,303
#trash dick shout out to people like Trent Lott

1382
01:13:38,559 --> 01:13:39,583
People like

1383
01:13:39,839 --> 01:13:44,447
Alex Jones's dear friend Larry Pratt right citizens for gun

1384
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:45,983
Why didn't Sacha Baron Cohen

1385
01:13:46,495 --> 01:13:48,031
Sacha Baron Cohen

1386
01:13:48,287 --> 01:13:50,079
I think Larry Nichols

1387
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:56,223
That would have been the one not on their radar.

1388
01:13:57,247 --> 01:13:58,527
You guys don't even know

1389
01:13:58,783 --> 01:14:02,111
I don't even take in the analysis

1390
01:14:05,183 --> 01:14:05,951
Progressive media

1391
01:14:06,207 --> 01:14:06,719
People like Sam's

1392
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:09,023
Cedar yeah

1393
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:10,815
YouTube channels that have gone over it

1394
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:14,655
How important

1395
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:15,423
Larry Pratt

1396
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:16,959
In terms of that

1397
01:14:17,215 --> 01:14:18,751
He's gone organization

1398
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:20,031
Was one of the big major

1399
01:14:20,287 --> 01:14:21,055
Your forces bit pushed

1400
01:14:21,311 --> 01:14:25,151
The NRA so hard right like they were very instrumental

1401
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:25,919
I'm pushing them

1402
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:27,199
To be less than 2

1403
01:14:27,455 --> 01:14:28,735
Absolutely

1404
01:14:28,991 --> 01:14:31,039
In 2009 when we

1405
01:14:31,295 --> 01:14:32,575
Check in with Alex Jones

1406
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:33,855
He hates the NRA

1407
01:14:34,111 --> 01:14:36,671
Because they are too wishy-washy

1408
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:42,303
Possibly okay with you

1409
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:43,839
They hadn't even

1410
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:47,167
Metaphorically

1411
01:14:48,191 --> 01:14:48,959
So like

1412
01:14:49,215 --> 01:14:50,495
I love all this

1413
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:53,055
See what Alex Jones at

1414
01:14:56,127 --> 01:14:57,407
Stupid

1415
01:14:57,663 --> 01:14:58,687
Sacha Baron Cohen

1416
01:15:00,991 --> 01:15:02,527
Goodbye

1417
01:15:11,743 --> 01:15:13,791
Bad news baby

1418
01:15:14,047 --> 01:15:14,815
The Onion

1419
01:15:15,071 --> 01:15:16,095
King of fake news

1420
01:15:16,863 --> 01:15:17,631
Oh no

1421
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:18,399
Oh no

1422
01:15:18,655 --> 01:15:22,239
What the title of this video is better than I could have possibly

1423
01:15:22,495 --> 01:15:24,543
So when I clicked on it all I saw was mus

1424
01:15:25,055 --> 01:15:26,079
Sacha Baron Cohen

1425
01:15:26,335 --> 01:15:28,127
I like Alex Jones

1426
01:15:31,455 --> 01:15:32,479
The whole title

1427
01:15:32,735 --> 01:15:33,503
Musty

1428
01:15:33,759 --> 01:15:36,319
Sacha Baron Cohen stocks Alex Jones

1429
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:40,927
We're going to have to wear this

1430
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:42,975
Late night comedy shows

1431
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:46,047
Like Homeland

1432
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:52,703
Notre Dame

1433
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:58,335
Sacha Baron yeah yeah yeah

1434
01:15:58,591 --> 01:16:01,919
Infowars

1435
01:16:05,247 --> 01:16:05,759
Think about it

1436
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:08,831
They put it out like this

1437
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:17,535
Call for

1438
01:16:17,791 --> 01:16:20,351
Sizzle

1439
01:16:20,607 --> 01:16:23,423
Bad now that was a good

1440
01:16:23,935 --> 01:16:29,567
Make Ready line. Troops beyond their energy field

1441
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:36,735
Strike Back

1442
01:16:36,991 --> 01:16:39,039
Cool

1443
01:16:40,063 --> 01:16:41,599
Are you taking the Republic back

1444
01:16:41,855 --> 01:16:42,367
Well

1445
01:16:42,879 --> 01:16:45,183
I suspected this six months ago but now we've

1446
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:47,487
Baron Cohen

1447
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:50,047
Emails right now

1448
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:56,191
Infowars and wanting in the building

1449
01:16:57,215 --> 01:17:03,359
No s*** policy where I basically don't talk to me Street Media anymore

1450
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:04,383
Divided America

1451
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:08,991
They targeted him with the wrong character

1452
01:17:09,247 --> 01:17:09,759
Yeah

1453
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:16,159
For sure cuz in least from what I've seen

1454
01:17:16,415 --> 01:17:17,439
From Israel

1455
01:17:17,695 --> 01:17:20,511
Lures people with

1456
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:21,279
The

1457
01:17:21,535 --> 01:17:22,815
Disabled

1458
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:24,607
Not disabled veteran guy

1459
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:26,655
Who

1460
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:28,191
Yeah

1461
01:17:28,447 --> 01:17:29,727
You go in

1462
01:17:29,983 --> 01:17:30,495
To Alex

1463
01:17:30,751 --> 01:17:31,263
With

1464
01:17:33,055 --> 01:17:35,871
I think that means that they went with the

1465
01:17:36,127 --> 01:17:36,639
The veteran

1466
01:17:36,895 --> 01:17:37,407
Probably

1467
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:44,063
If they went with the Israel guy I think he probably would have been like are you kidding me hello

1468
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:46,623
Contrarian

1469
01:17:46,879 --> 01:17:47,647
I'm just saying

1470
01:17:47,903 --> 01:17:49,695
You know what with the show

1471
01:17:49,951 --> 01:17:50,463
I'm going to pass

1472
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:53,535
Approached

1473
01:17:54,047 --> 01:17:55,583
Here's my prediction I don't know if this is

1474
01:17:57,119 --> 01:17:57,887
I would predict

1475
01:17:59,167 --> 01:18:00,447
They even did reach out to him

1476
01:18:00,703 --> 01:18:04,543
He's not just trying to have Stolen Valor of

1477
01:18:04,799 --> 01:18:08,895
Please excuse possibility conversation

1478
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:09,919
But if not

1479
01:18:10,175 --> 01:18:12,223
With that Patriot

1480
01:18:16,831 --> 01:18:18,111
Heartless

1481
01:18:19,391 --> 01:18:19,903
I don't give a

1482
01:18:20,415 --> 01:18:21,183
If they had

1483
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:22,463
Approached him with

1484
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:25,023
Something that stroked his vanity

1485
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:26,559
Like the character who is like

1486
01:18:26,815 --> 01:18:27,839
You're getting a reward

1487
01:18:28,095 --> 01:18:32,191
We're getting an award for friends of his.

1488
01:18:32,447 --> 01:18:38,591
It was friends of Israel that would have given him so much leave

1489
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:39,359
Skeptical

1490
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:40,895
But he would have gotten over that pretty quick

1491
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:42,943
Yeah he would have done a little bit of digging

1492
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:44,479
Not been able to figure it out

1493
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:50,111
Flash

1494
01:18:51,903 --> 01:18:53,439
Gmail

1495
01:19:00,351 --> 01:19:01,375

1496
01:19:04,447 --> 01:19:05,471
Sacha Baron Cohen

1497
01:19:06,495 --> 01:19:07,007
SPC

1498
01:19:08,287 --> 01:19:10,335
You know

1499
01:19:16,223 --> 01:19:18,783
Like Homeland

1500
01:19:19,807 --> 01:19:24,927
From the opposition movement is not a common

1501
01:19:29,023 --> 01:19:31,583
They put it out like the things they're saying

1502
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:37,727
And then today

1503
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:40,287
Call Ford

1504
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:46,687
Boarding pass more into Sacha Baron Cohen

1505
01:19:47,711 --> 01:19:49,503
Here is the problem structurally with

1506
01:19:49,759 --> 01:19:51,039
As opposed

1507
01:19:51,295 --> 01:19:51,807
The other clubs

1508
01:19:52,319 --> 01:19:52,831
So far

1509
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:55,647
Literally two minutes into this clip

1510
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:56,671
GDP

1511
01:19:56,927 --> 01:19:59,231
30 seconds of the sizzle reel

1512
01:19:59,487 --> 01:20:01,791
Seconds of the first

1513
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:07,167
Minute

1514
01:20:07,423 --> 01:20:07,935
From a production

1515
01:20:08,959 --> 01:20:09,727
You can't just be like

1516
01:20:14,848 --> 01:20:20,224
I need to know more about his feelings

1517
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:21,248
How long is Bigfoot

1518
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:23,040
The clip of rattling

1519
01:20:23,296 --> 01:20:25,344
No I'm just asking

1520
01:20:27,392 --> 01:20:30,720
Skip ahead 2 minutes

1521
01:20:30,976 --> 01:20:32,256
7 ish 7 ish minutes

1522
01:20:32,512 --> 01:20:33,792
Right here we are coming in

1523
01:20:34,816 --> 01:20:35,328
What's 53

1524
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:40,704
Homeland

1525
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:51,968
Do you have

1526
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:55,040
Storyline

1527
01:20:58,368 --> 01:21:03,232
Great article from 2015

1528
01:21:06,816 --> 01:21:07,584
Because

1529
01:21:08,608 --> 01:21:10,400
Weird

1530
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:11,168
Watch this

1531
01:21:11,424 --> 01:21:11,936
Scrap

1532
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:16,800
Republican voters also watch

1533
01:21:27,296 --> 01:21:33,440
Muse band

1534
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:39,072
Not boring snack joke

1535
01:21:45,472 --> 01:21:46,752
This is the key

1536
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:48,288
Myself

1537
01:21:51,104 --> 01:21:52,640
Bobby's Facebook

1538
01:21:55,456 --> 01:21:56,224
Bale

1539
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:56,992
Bale

1540
01:21:57,504 --> 01:21:58,016
Bale

1541
01:21:58,272 --> 01:22:00,320
Want to know more about his feelings

1542
01:22:00,576 --> 01:22:01,088
About

1543
01:22:01,344 --> 01:22:02,624
Borat

1544
01:22:03,136 --> 01:22:03,904
That's all I want

1545
01:22:04,672 --> 01:22:05,952
That's all I wanted out of that clip

1546
01:22:06,208 --> 01:22:07,744
Yeah I like disappointing

1547
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,560
I bet he didn't say much in that 26 minutes

1548
01:22:10,816 --> 01:22:16,960
He probably said some stuff about like you know what I was the big fish

1549
01:22:17,216 --> 01:22:19,520
Islip Cinemas

1550
01:22:19,776 --> 01:22:23,872
Bale

1551
01:22:26,944 --> 01:22:29,504
It's me that these guys just

1552
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:31,808
Don't understand what the

1553
01:22:32,064 --> 01:22:32,832
Differences

1554
01:22:33,344 --> 01:22:33,856
Lego

1555
01:22:34,112 --> 01:22:35,392
Like if you get tricked

1556
01:22:37,696 --> 01:22:38,720
If nothing

1557
01:22:38,976 --> 01:22:42,048
How can you compare it to all of these Republicans

1558
01:22:42,304 --> 01:22:43,840
Going on the show and being like

1559
01:22:44,352 --> 01:22:47,680
Phuc yea let's arm children I don't give a s***

1560
01:22:47,936 --> 01:22:48,704
There there

1561
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:55,872
Blue pit Joy is enough to indict them

1562
01:22:56,128 --> 01:22:57,152
Because I haven't watched

1563
01:22:57,408 --> 01:22:58,944
The entire shall I can only judge

1564
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:01,248
The contacts

1565
01:23:01,504 --> 01:23:02,528
Clues I glean from that

1566
01:23:03,808 --> 01:23:04,576
Very clearly

1567
01:23:05,088 --> 01:23:06,880
Were these people were reading teleprompter

1568
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:12,256
Conservative Ding Dongs we're reading a teleprompter

1569
01:23:13,024 --> 01:23:15,072
It's very clear they're doing a cold read

1570
01:23:15,328 --> 01:23:16,608
No s*** yes

1571
01:23:16,864 --> 01:23:20,960
I haven't I haven't seen any of it I'm just again

1572
01:23:21,216 --> 01:23:25,056
I'm out the trailer of it is a script

1573
01:23:25,312 --> 01:23:26,592
You can you can tell

1574
01:23:26,848 --> 01:23:27,360
It's a song

1575
01:23:28,384 --> 01:23:28,896
Did like

1576
01:23:29,152 --> 01:23:31,200
These people like Dana rohrabacher walls

1577
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:33,504
Cold reading

1578
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:34,528
Off of like

1579
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:36,320
Well the

1580
01:23:36,576 --> 01:23:41,952
Kinderguardians program allows children to be able to protect themselves

1581
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:44,512
Okay they're doing like a commercial

1582
01:23:46,048 --> 01:23:50,656
Okay it's clear that they are not seeing their own word right

1583
01:23:50,912 --> 01:23:51,424
I

1584
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:54,240
Take issue with little league bomber

1585
01:23:54,496 --> 01:23:55,776
Tricked ya no no

1586
01:23:56,288 --> 01:23:58,848
It's worse than just getting tricked

1587
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:00,128
Because if you are

1588
01:24:01,152 --> 01:24:01,664
Person

1589
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:06,272
And you're reading a teleprompter

1590
01:24:06,784 --> 01:24:10,368
What is this I don't think

1591
01:24:11,392 --> 01:24:12,672
You're crazy

1592
01:24:15,232 --> 01:24:16,256
Here's what I'm about to say

1593
01:24:16,768 --> 01:24:22,400
These are stupid vapid people who will read whatever is put in front of them

1594
01:24:22,656 --> 01:24:26,240
So long as it like if you if you put in front of them like

1595
01:24:26,496 --> 01:24:28,032
I think we should

1596
01:24:28,288 --> 01:24:32,640
Give Healthcare to people they would like anything less than that

1597
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:35,712
They're dumb

1598
01:24:35,968 --> 01:24:37,248
It just seems like there

1599
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:38,528
Really dumb

1600
01:24:39,296 --> 01:24:40,576
The really that alright

1601
01:24:40,832 --> 01:24:41,600
Let's do one more

1602
01:24:42,368 --> 01:24:43,136
I know I know

1603
01:24:43,392 --> 01:24:44,928
Find trying to find one but

1604
01:24:46,208 --> 01:24:47,744
The issue for me now comes down

1605
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,024
How did the fact that like

1606
01:24:51,328 --> 01:24:51,840
Titles are

1607
01:24:52,352 --> 01:24:52,864
Good

1608
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:54,912
I can only see a few words of

1609
01:24:55,168 --> 01:24:55,680
The title

1610
01:24:56,192 --> 01:24:57,216
And I got to find

1611
01:25:01,312 --> 01:25:01,824
Alright

1612
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:04,384
We got a we got a dismount on this

1613
01:25:04,896 --> 01:25:05,408
What are we got

1614
01:25:24,608 --> 01:25:25,120
The sound mix

1615
01:25:25,632 --> 01:25:31,776
Because Owen is much lower than the video that they're playing

1616
01:25:32,032 --> 01:25:38,176
Oh yeah

1617
01:25:38,432 --> 01:25:40,224
Based on

1618
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:42,272
Audio

1619
01:25:46,368 --> 01:25:49,696
The video of it

1620
01:25:52,768 --> 01:25:53,536
Speeches

1621
01:25:54,048 --> 01:25:54,816
Is weird

1622
01:25:55,328 --> 01:25:56,864
The flipping

1623
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:58,144
Zombie horde of ants

1624
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:00,192
Trump protesters roasted

1625
01:26:00,448 --> 01:26:01,216
Great movie title

1626
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:12,736
He's recording in like a kitchen

1627
01:26:12,992 --> 01:26:18,368
With no like

1628
01:26:18,624 --> 01:26:22,208
There is no video of him the video is over

1629
01:26:24,768 --> 01:26:25,280
I think he's

1630
01:26:25,536 --> 01:26:27,072
Just doing this like a maybe

1631
01:26:27,328 --> 01:26:29,120
Bathroom alright

1632
01:26:34,496 --> 01:26:35,264
Good question

1633
01:26:38,336 --> 01:26:39,104
Good question

1634
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:39,872
Rigged

1635
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:43,712
Ghetto

1636
01:26:53,952 --> 01:26:54,720
Good on

1637
01:26:55,488 --> 01:26:56,512
Attempted to

1638
01:26:58,048 --> 01:26:58,560
Good save

1639
01:27:05,216 --> 01:27:11,360
Reminder said correctly his defensive Russia

1640
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:16,224
Well because

1641
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:22,624
Scott realized how

1642
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:25,952
That he's dumb because that's like that's what

1643
01:27:26,464 --> 01:27:30,048
Concretely provable is work done

1644
01:27:32,864 --> 01:27:33,376
B r o

1645
01:27:33,888 --> 01:27:34,400
Forensically

1646
01:27:34,656 --> 01:27:35,936
Approval in terms of

1647
01:27:36,192 --> 01:27:36,704
Intelligence

1648
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:39,008
Is available

1649
01:27:40,032 --> 01:27:41,568
Art that they were successful

1650
01:27:41,824 --> 01:27:42,336
So

1651
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:46,432
Did him being like Oh I'm going to roast you but

1652
01:27:50,016 --> 01:27:51,040
You should just say

1653
01:27:51,296 --> 01:27:51,808
No

1654
01:27:52,064 --> 01:27:58,208
Always giving them your info

1655
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:03,840
No category clean up

1656
01:28:04,096 --> 01:28:04,608
I just like

1657
01:28:04,864 --> 01:28:11,008
It's this sound is so terrible

1658
01:28:11,264 --> 01:28:14,080
Mitigare

1659
01:28:14,592 --> 01:28:15,104
Maybe

1660
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:16,640
After

1661
01:28:16,896 --> 01:28:20,480
A big night watching this clip

1662
01:28:22,016 --> 01:28:22,528
Commentary for it

1663
01:28:43,008 --> 01:28:49,152
That was 30 seconds old is Johnny hordes of anti Trump protesters wrote

1664
01:28:49,408 --> 01:28:55,552
I don't hear any roasting

1665
01:29:23,456 --> 01:29:25,504
Alright

1666
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:29,344
And it's not like

1667
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:31,136
There is not the precedent set

1668
01:29:31,648 --> 01:29:35,744
Just going to butt in with stuff he's going to butter with jelly

1669
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:41,120
Really really really left-wing guy is jealous

1670
01:29:41,376 --> 01:29:42,400
Why would you

1671
01:29:44,704 --> 01:29:50,848
Why in God's name would you be like the FBI

1672
01:29:53,152 --> 01:29:56,736
Has been garbage for 1000

1673
01:29:57,504 --> 01:29:58,272
80s

1674
01:29:58,528 --> 01:29:59,296
Amazing

1675
01:29:59,552 --> 01:30:05,696
How weird it is for the left now to like rely on

1676
01:30:05,952 --> 01:30:08,256
High-top black male Martin Luther King

1677
01:30:08,512 --> 01:30:11,328
Junior as though it's some sort of bulwark against

1678
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:13,888
Authoritarianism

1679
01:30:14,144 --> 01:30:17,216
BFDI is on the side of authoritarianism

1680
01:30:18,752 --> 01:30:20,032
I would say

1681
01:30:21,312 --> 01:30:22,848
Mike my defense today

1682
01:30:23,104 --> 01:30:23,616
I think

1683
01:30:24,128 --> 01:30:24,896
Is that I also do not

1684
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:26,432
But I

1685
01:30:27,712 --> 01:30:28,224
And I hope

1686
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:30,528
Live no reason

1687
01:30:30,784 --> 01:30:31,296
Believer

1688
01:30:32,064 --> 01:30:34,368
My romantic idealism coming out

1689
01:30:37,184 --> 01:30:37,952
Zoe's

1690
01:30:38,208 --> 01:30:39,488
Chapters in our history

1691
01:30:39,744 --> 01:30:42,048
You're talkin about

1692
01:30:42,816 --> 01:30:43,328
60 years ago

1693
01:30:43,584 --> 01:30:47,168
Years ago

1694
01:30:47,424 --> 01:30:50,240
During the Iraq War whenever Bob Mohler him

1695
01:30:50,496 --> 01:30:51,264
Self

1696
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:56,640
Katie

1697
01:30:56,896 --> 01:31:01,760
And convincing people that good idea

1698
01:31:05,344 --> 01:31:05,856
Let's see what

1699
01:31:07,648 --> 01:31:08,672
Okay also

1700
01:31:09,184 --> 01:31:10,464
It's amazing to me

1701
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:13,280
That Owen Shroyer hasn't figured out Alex's

1702
01:31:13,536 --> 01:31:14,048
District of

1703
01:31:14,304 --> 01:31:20,448
Don't let the full clip play or started again terrible idea

1704
01:31:20,704 --> 01:31:23,520
All of those things are legitimately reasonable

1705
01:31:23,776 --> 01:31:25,824
We're not going to listen to this whole thing but I

1706
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:28,384
I'm f****** putting the clock on when Owens

1707
01:31:52,448 --> 01:31:55,776
So there you go

1708
01:31:56,288 --> 01:31:57,056
Terrible

1709
01:31:58,080 --> 01:31:58,848
Until he just

1710
01:31:59,104 --> 01:31:59,616
Listen to

1711
01:32:00,896 --> 01:32:01,920
Is there sounding horn

1712
01:32:05,504 --> 01:32:06,272
We will live

1713
01:32:06,528 --> 01:32:07,808
George Soros zombie horde

1714
01:32:09,088 --> 01:32:11,392
Alive ask George Soros

1715
01:32:27,008 --> 01:32:28,288
Peaches letting this play

1716
01:32:38,528 --> 01:32:39,552
Great great

1717
01:32:40,576 --> 01:32:43,648
We are 2 minutes and 40 seconds into this

1718
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:46,208
This is a man asleep at the wheel

1719
01:32:46,464 --> 01:32:47,488
This is a drunk

1720
01:32:47,744 --> 01:32:53,888
Pilot who is Nat

1721
01:32:54,144 --> 01:32:55,680
What are what

1722
01:32:56,192 --> 01:32:59,520
I would love it I would love it

1723
01:33:00,032 --> 01:33:01,056
Owen Shroyer

1724
01:33:05,152 --> 01:33:10,528
And he was like

1725
01:33:11,552 --> 01:33:14,880
We just going along with this

1726
01:33:15,136 --> 01:33:15,648
If you were espousing

1727
01:33:16,416 --> 01:33:16,928
Yeah

1728
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:19,488
I realize you're probably right

1729
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:26,912
Right around 30 year old young

1730
01:33:27,168 --> 01:33:27,680
Young Buck

1731
01:33:27,936 --> 01:33:31,520
Like why don't you show your Bona fides get in there

1732
01:33:33,568 --> 01:33:34,592
You know instead of like

1733
01:33:35,104 --> 01:33:37,920
We're 2 minutes and 45 seconds

1734
01:33:38,432 --> 01:33:40,480
A minute

1735
01:33:40,992 --> 01:33:42,016
Silence

1736
01:33:42,272 --> 01:33:43,552
The rest of it has been

1737
01:33:43,808 --> 01:33:44,320
Nothing

1738
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:47,136
Nothing

1739
01:33:47,392 --> 01:33:48,672
When he comes in here

1740
01:33:48,928 --> 01:33:49,440
And I should be

1741
01:33:49,696 --> 01:33:50,208
Hydraclear

1742
01:33:50,464 --> 01:33:55,328
40 minutes

1743
01:33:55,584 --> 01:34:00,704
Honestly we're done with this ruler

1744
01:34:01,216 --> 01:34:02,240
Read to me

1745
01:34:06,336 --> 01:34:08,128
I understand the idea of letting

1746
01:34:08,384 --> 01:34:08,896
Sing someone

1747
01:34:09,152 --> 01:34:09,920
Speak their piece

1748
01:34:10,176 --> 01:34:10,688
Before you

1749
01:34:10,944 --> 01:34:11,456
Call Manon

1750
01:34:12,736 --> 01:34:15,296
Call VSCO Broadcasting

1751
01:34:15,552 --> 01:34:17,088
It's also just being courteous

1752
01:34:17,344 --> 01:34:19,392
Intellectually honest

1753
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:22,720
Sitting there waiting for somebody

1754
01:34:23,232 --> 01:34:24,000
But you still interrupting

1755
01:34:24,512 --> 01:34:27,072
Like earlier with dumb b*******

1756
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:28,096
Just don't have any

1757
01:34:31,168 --> 01:34:32,960
That's the thing that I

1758
01:34:33,472 --> 01:34:34,496
I wonder about

1759
01:34:34,752 --> 01:34:37,568
Is when people are listening to Orange

1760
01:34:37,824 --> 01:34:38,848
Which state

1761
01:34:39,104 --> 01:34:39,616
Net

1762
01:34:45,248 --> 01:34:47,808
3000 battery

1763
01:34:49,344 --> 01:34:52,672
If I had if I had all the data

1764
01:34:52,928 --> 01:34:53,440
Legacies

1765
01:34:53,696 --> 01:34:59,840
Turned it off after 40 seconds

1766
01:35:00,096 --> 01:35:01,632
His situation here though

1767
01:35:01,888 --> 01:35:03,168
He's letting the full clip

1768
01:35:03,424 --> 01:35:04,448
Play no

1769
01:35:06,496 --> 01:35:07,008
He's letting

1770
01:35:07,264 --> 01:35:08,800
Enough of the clip play

1771
01:35:09,312 --> 01:35:11,872
A reasonable

1772
01:35:12,384 --> 01:35:13,408
And then he's just

1773
01:35:13,664 --> 01:35:14,944
Denying reality

1774
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:18,016
Like Drew

1775
01:35:19,808 --> 01:35:20,576
No that guy is

1776
01:35:20,832 --> 01:35:22,368
Put together

1777
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:28,768
Like even if you disagree

1778
01:35:29,024 --> 01:35:31,072
Yeah that's your business but

1779
01:35:31,328 --> 01:35:32,608
So he's just he's just

1780
01:35:33,376 --> 01:35:35,168
Creating this alternate reality

1781
01:35:35,424 --> 01:35:36,960
Alex does that

1782
01:35:37,216 --> 01:35:37,728
Doesn't

1783
01:35:37,984 --> 01:35:39,008
Let the whole clip

1784
01:35:39,264 --> 01:35:45,408
Play doesn't let people make

1785
01:35:45,664 --> 01:35:46,688
That is coach

1786
01:35:49,504 --> 01:35:50,528
I'm going to let you come

1787
01:35:50,784 --> 01:35:51,296
Complete your thoughts

1788
01:35:51,552 --> 01:35:52,832
And then I'm going to live

1789
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:55,136
Alex abuses

1790
01:35:55,392 --> 01:35:58,976
The Source material

1791
01:36:03,584 --> 01:36:04,608
He's much more of a believer

1792
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:06,400
Yeah I think this is him

1793
01:36:06,912 --> 01:36:07,424
Phoniness

1794
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:08,448
Jaden Hardy

1795
01:36:12,032 --> 01:36:13,312
Man I'll tell you what I own

1796
01:36:15,872 --> 01:36:16,896
I knows it

1797
01:36:17,152 --> 01:36:18,432
I've made a Cottage Inn

1798
01:36:18,688 --> 01:36:19,200
History out of hate

1799
01:36:19,456 --> 01:36:19,968
Infowars

1800
01:36:20,224 --> 01:36:21,504
Yeah it's kind of my thing

1801
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:22,528
Yeah

1802
01:36:23,808 --> 01:36:24,320
Disappointed

1803
01:36:24,832 --> 01:36:26,368
Yeah

1804
01:36:26,624 --> 01:36:29,440
We've listened to a lot of like bad video

1805
01:36:32,512 --> 01:36:34,304
But this one to me is like you guys weren't Eve

1806
01:36:37,632 --> 01:36:38,912
He's more of a bully

1807
01:36:41,216 --> 01:36:41,984
I don't know why you

1808
01:36:43,008 --> 01:36:43,520
Forever in

1809
01:36:43,776 --> 01:36:44,544
Not talking over

1810
01:36:45,056 --> 01:36:45,824
Yeah I don't

1811
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:46,592
First and I don't

1812
01:36:46,848 --> 01:36:47,360
By Alex

1813
01:36:47,616 --> 01:36:48,128
It would allow this

1814
01:36:48,384 --> 01:36:48,896
To go out on

1815
01:36:49,408 --> 01:36:51,200
20000

1816
01:36:51,712 --> 01:36:55,296
Reviews or whatever and I'm sure there's a super male vitality

1817
01:36:55,552 --> 01:36:56,064
The end of it

1818
01:36:56,576 --> 01:36:57,088
But like

1819
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:00,160
Also I should tell you this

1820
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:03,488
Alex

1821
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:04,512
Marcon

1822
01:37:04,768 --> 01:37:05,280
Super male vitality

1823
01:37:05,792 --> 01:37:07,072
Atlantic in 2015

1824
01:37:07,328 --> 01:37:10,144
Super male vitality

1825
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:10,912
Kudzu Alex

1826
01:37:11,424 --> 01:37:13,216
Also super female vitality

1827
01:37:13,472 --> 01:37:14,496
Holyshit

1828
01:37:18,592 --> 01:37:19,616
Pay some money probably for

1829
01:37:21,664 --> 01:37:22,688
I don't know you maybe have to get

1830
01:37:22,944 --> 01:37:23,712
Trademark lawyer

1831
01:37:24,992 --> 01:37:26,016
Product I don't know

1832
01:37:26,272 --> 01:37:29,088
I just thought it was funny I was going through trademarks

1833
01:37:30,368 --> 01:37:31,136
Like most of his

1834
01:37:31,392 --> 01:37:31,904
Trademarks

1835
01:37:43,936 --> 01:37:44,704
Cares about that one

1836
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:47,008
There's one

1837
01:37:50,336 --> 01:37:52,128
So I found this new trademark

1838
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:53,408
From fries

1839
01:37:54,688 --> 01:37:55,200
I don't know what the

1840
01:37:55,456 --> 01:37:56,736
This is going to be okay I can't

1841
01:37:57,248 --> 01:37:57,760
Find it

1842
01:37:58,016 --> 01:37:58,528
But it was

1843
01:37:58,784 --> 01:37:59,552
Was just filed

1844
01:38:00,576 --> 01:38:01,088
A month-and-a-half

1845
01:38:02,368 --> 01:38:03,648
Firepower radio

1846
01:38:03,904 --> 01:38:05,696
Okay he filed a trademark

1847
01:38:05,952 --> 01:38:07,488
Look for Firepower radio

1848
01:38:07,744 --> 01:38:08,256
Weird

1849
01:38:08,512 --> 01:38:09,792
I don't know what that's going to be

1850
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:11,072
But

1851
01:38:13,888 --> 01:38:14,912
You look over it and see

1852
01:38:15,168 --> 01:38:15,680
Just like

1853
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:17,472
I saw that

1854
01:38:17,728 --> 01:38:18,240
Boilerplate

1855
01:38:19,776 --> 01:38:20,288
Yeah

1856
01:38:20,544 --> 01:38:21,568
What's Firepower

1857
01:38:23,104 --> 01:38:23,616
Also

1858
01:38:23,872 --> 01:38:24,640
That sort of thing

1859
01:38:24,896 --> 01:38:25,920
Is so crazy to

1860
01:38:26,432 --> 01:38:28,992
Because it reduces the idea of like you're able to like

1861
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:30,272
Preemptive

1862
01:38:30,528 --> 01:38:31,040
Movie trademark

1863
01:38:31,808 --> 01:38:33,088
Yeah doing

1864
01:38:33,344 --> 01:38:34,368
Yeah why

1865
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:35,904
You not at all

1866
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:36,672
Take care of

1867
01:38:37,184 --> 01:38:38,464
425 Supply

1868
01:38:39,488 --> 01:38:40,256
Oh well okay

1869
01:38:40,768 --> 01:38:44,096
Well that's what a lot of witches

1870
01:38:44,352 --> 01:38:46,656
Infowars survival which is also not

1871
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:53,056
It's like the patent trolls try to do try to take down pod

1872
01:38:53,312 --> 01:38:54,592
Cast

1873
01:38:54,848 --> 01:38:57,152
People registering domains that they think

1874
01:38:57,408 --> 01:38:57,920
Might be

1875
01:38:58,176 --> 01:39:00,224

Tragic

1900
01:39:48,096 --> 01:39:48,608
Stupid

01:39:48,864 --> 01:39:50,656
There's a number of these that are

1902
01:39:50,912 --> 01:39:51,424

1903
01:39:51,936 --> 01:39:52,704
Call current

1904
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:53,472

1905
01:39:53,728 --> 01:39:54,240
That are like

1906
01:39:55,008 --> 01:39:55,776
Zelda fan

1907
01:39:58,592 --> 01:40:00,384
Super male Vitality lap

No cuz I need to go

1909
01:40:03,456 --> 01:40:04,480
He probably just

1910
01:40:05,248 --> 01:40:08,832
Think anybody would pay attention doesn't want to waste his money on it

1911
01:40:09,344 --> 01:40:10,624
Here's the last thing I want to bring up

1912
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:11,648
Before we close the show

1913
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:14,464
Alex also

1914
01:40:15,232 --> 01:40:16,000
Got a trademark

1915
01:40:16,256 --> 01:40:18,560
For something called honor roll

1916
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:21,120
I don't know what that means at all

1917
01:40:21,376 --> 01:40:21,888
I don't either

1918
01:40:22,656 --> 01:40:24,192
Kid honor roll

1919
01:40:24,704 --> 01:40:26,496
Kid maybe I don't leave the word

1920
01:40:26,752 --> 01:40:28,288
Words that we are going to look out for in the

1921
01:40:29,568 --> 01:40:30,336
Honor roll

1922
01:40:30,848 --> 01:40:31,872
Firepower radio

1923
01:40:32,128 --> 01:40:33,408
Those two things

1924
01:40:33,664 --> 01:40:34,176
AR

1925
01:40:34,432 --> 01:40:38,528
We're going to keep our eyes on that

1926
01:40:40,832 --> 01:40:42,624
And they are real thing okay

1927
01:40:45,184 --> 01:40:45,696
What would happen

1928
01:40:46,208 --> 01:40:48,512
If we did get the trademark for a Superman visor

1929
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:53,888
Just something we can do

1930
01:40:54,144 --> 01:40:54,656
I don't think so

1931
01:40:55,168 --> 01:40:56,448
I think it would be like

1932
01:40:56,704 --> 01:40:57,216
Exposed

1933
01:40:58,752 --> 01:41:01,824
Grandfathered

1934
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:03,360
Existing product or whatever

1935
01:41:03,616 --> 01:41:06,432
What is it would be in the paper being abusive

1936
01:41:10,528 --> 01:41:12,064
I feel I feel like it

1937
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:12,832
First of all

1938
01:41:13,088 --> 01:41:13,600
Besties

1939
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:16,160
But event

1940
01:41:17,184 --> 01:41:17,696
Superman

1941
01:41:18,208 --> 01:41:19,232
It's open

1942
01:41:19,488 --> 01:41:20,000
Nothing

1943
01:41:22,304 --> 01:41:25,120
So Jordan we've come to the end of this

1944
01:41:25,632 --> 01:41:26,656
Infowars roulette

1945
01:41:27,424 --> 01:41:28,192
I think

1946
01:41:28,704 --> 01:41:29,728
Better than we could have

1947
01:41:31,264 --> 01:41:32,032
I think when we started

1948
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:33,312
We thought it would be

1949
01:41:34,592 --> 01:41:35,104
Well we're going to listen

1950
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:35,872
I'm something boring for

1951
01:41:40,224 --> 01:41:41,760
And I would say that the more fun things

1952
01:41:42,016 --> 01:41:45,600
Is you and I being able to organically respond

1953
01:41:45,856 --> 01:41:46,368
Similarly

1954
01:41:54,816 --> 01:41:56,608
I love this

1955
01:41:59,936 --> 01:42:00,960
Intermittently in the

1956
01:42:01,728 --> 01:42:02,240
But I think

1957
01:42:02,496 --> 01:42:03,520
Who you want to submit

1958
01:42:04,544 --> 01:42:05,056
What we learned

1959
01:42:05,312 --> 01:42:05,824
Yeah

1960
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:08,640
I Come Away with only one thing

1961
01:42:09,152 --> 01:42:09,664
What basketball

1962
01:42:10,688 --> 01:42:14,528
Well if you say first of all that means you didn't come away with only $0.01

1963
01:42:15,552 --> 01:42:16,064
1

1964
01:42:18,368 --> 01:42:19,136
Did Rudy Giuliani

1965
01:42:19,392 --> 01:42:20,672
To do that bumper

1966
01:42:22,208 --> 01:42:28,352
He did not going to plague me it is nightmare

1967
01:42:28,608 --> 01:42:31,680
More Rodger Stone episodes in order to make sure that call Rudy

1968
01:42:40,640 --> 01:42:42,176
Second thing I come

1969
01:42:42,432 --> 01:42:42,944
Is

1970
01:42:44,224 --> 01:42:45,760
I own before this

1971
01:42:46,016 --> 01:42:47,296
I don't know a lot of

1972
01:42:47,552 --> 01:42:48,064
The proud boys

1973
01:42:49,088 --> 01:42:51,904
I'd only known about bass

1974
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:52,672
Stickman

1975
01:42:52,928 --> 01:42:53,952
Yeah I'm so

1976
01:42:54,208 --> 01:42:56,000
Hearing about Rufio panman

1977
01:42:56,256 --> 01:42:57,024
Fantastic

1978
01:42:57,536 --> 01:42:58,304
So excited

1979
01:42:58,560 --> 01:42:59,328
About the idea

1980
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:00,352

1981
01:43:00,608 --> 01:43:06,752
8 word ends in a noun and two-man whatever you whatever you have hit

1982
01:43:08,288 --> 01:43:14,432
You are just Blankman

1983
01:43:14,688 --> 01:43:16,736
When it was only

1984
01:43:16,992 --> 01:43:18,528
Basic man and

1985
01:43:18,784 --> 01:43:20,576
Rufio

1986
01:43:21,088 --> 01:43:23,392
Once we got to New Jersey

1987
01:43:23,648 --> 01:43:24,160
Kauai

1988
01:43:24,672 --> 01:43:30,816
That's three that's a pattern

1989
01:43:31,072 --> 01:43:32,608
Coincidence

1990
01:43:32,864 --> 01:43:37,472
Batman

1991
01:43:41,056 --> 01:43:45,408

What do you what are you doing here baguette man that's how I should say

1993
01:43:49,504 --> 01:43:52,832
What do you think about

1994
01:43:55,392 --> 01:43:58,464
Should have been short pants

1995
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:06,400
EBay even when he wears capris they go far too long legs are too short to box with God

1996
01:44:06,912 --> 01:44:12,800
Alrighty then if you wanted

1997
01:44:13,312 --> 01:44:14,336
Not updated that website

1998
01:44:14,592 --> 01:44:17,152

2000
01:44:22,272 --> 01:44:24,320
Like either my thoughts are

2001
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:26,368
Yeah exactly

2002
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:33,024
Like I'm either not putting forth an argument that you can't read somewhere else blood blood blood

2003
01:44:33,280 --> 01:44:35,840
Argument that people would look at

2004
01:44:36,864 --> 01:44:37,376
Nothing

2005
01:44:39,936 --> 01:44:40,704
A lot of my rating

2006
01:44:42,752 --> 01:44:43,264
Built up in

2007
01:44:44,288 --> 01:44:45,056
Long-term

2008
01:44:45,824 --> 01:44:46,848
Effort

2009
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:49,408
There's no payoff

2010
01:44:49,664 --> 01:44:53,504
For that right now but everyone so much

2011
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:54,528
