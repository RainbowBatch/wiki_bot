00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Air Jordan

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for knowledge B I'm sick of them

3
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:40,448
Need

4
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:56,320
College

5
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:22,176
Gelato ice cream truffle

6
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,736
Broke my hand open

7
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:31,136
I know that's a hackneyed observation those f****** jars need to do something about that

8
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,928
Unacceptable

9
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:33,952
Is that right

10
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:40,864
The worst

11
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:48,032
They're damn good

12
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:50,848
About

13
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:53,920
Because I'm not paying that much for ice cream on the regular

14
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:56,992
What's good today

15
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:01,856
Recording this before the move

16
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:05,184
Right until like the high stresses of the movie required

17
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:08,512
A fair amount of self-medicating Chrysler

18
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:11,072
That's a smart move

19
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:13,120
Classic

20
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,400
Slapstick comedy

21
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:16,704
Then that is my bright spot today

22
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:23,104
We made pancakes

23
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:26,176
Classic rock

24
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:28,224
Classic breakfast for dinner situation

25
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:36,160
We were walking our dogs at the time

26
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:39,488
My partner was like no let me carry those eggs for you

27
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:41,024
I'm about to hand them to her

28
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,328
She grabs puts one hand into the thing

29
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,192
12 eggs

30
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:51,520
Gone that is not slapstick comedy

31
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:55,872
Slapstick

32
00:02:56,128 --> 00:03:02,272
Did she do a soft-shoe now I don't think that's comedy

33
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:08,672
I think you could laugh at a conversation

34
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:13,280
That involves

35
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,048
Very

36
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:18,144
Very simple and direct perfect

37
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:29,152
2020

38
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:29,920
Do we have to record

39
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:35,040
I'm still getting all set up

40
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:42,720
Wanted to say hello to the Future

41
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:49,120
Your granddaughter is the president now

42
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,400
You were correct

43
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:56,800
It's mostly bring this up just in case any of the things we say sound entirely

44
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,664
The world changes appendix 310

45
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:08,576
So

46
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:14,976
Some slack it's a alien show up on Monday or something the past we don't know that stuff

47
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:22,399
Give them shout outs

Cams

68
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:59,423
That generosity into the form of

69
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:04,799
Local charity that would also be wonderful

70
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:09,407
I'm not good at that

71
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:12,735
Maybe there's something good about how bad

72
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,015
Classic slaps

73
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,599
So Jordan

Last episode from Monday discussed

75
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:24,767
Alex is going hard on this

76
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:27,071
This woman had put out where she's accusing doctors of

77
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:31,167
Is killing people in hospital it was

78
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:35,007
Thursday show on June 11th

79
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,567
This does not come back up on the 12th

80
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:38,847
It doesn't come back up at all

81
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:44,991
What are you talkin about does it come back on Thursday to be like

82
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:51,391
Not really

83
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,207
Tip

84
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:59,327
Over-the-top it is not it is Biden

85
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,119
Has announced the coup

86
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,703
Infowars.com

87
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:09,567
Biden says the US Military

88
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,127
President

89
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,015
Is that what they were saying

90
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:25,695
That's how you fight

91
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:29,023
He's with the military grabbing the president

92
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:38,495
So this is something came from an interview on The Daily Show

93
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,775
If you lost the election

94
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,359
Convinced

95
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:48,479
The military would recognize that was a huge problem

96
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,527
And would escort him out of the White House

97
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:57,183
He's not saying there's going to be a military coup just recognized the result of an election he lost

98
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:59,487
Will be handled appropriately

99
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:02,815
I'm not as fun but I don't say goodbye

100
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,863
Position is that outlandish either

101
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:10,495
I still think there's a decent chance that worrying about Trump not stepping is a little premature

102
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:17,151
There plenty of circumstantial reasons to be concerned about that and I've come a lot closer to worrying about it myself but it's just

103
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:17,919
Seems like it

104
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,967
Explicit and Unruh

105
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:27,903
Not respecting the result of an election is something that couldn't be walked back or undone

106
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:30,719
It would necessitate a very severe reaction

107
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:35,839
Whether it be the military taking him out or out breaking hostilities in the general population

108
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:41,471
I think it's okay thing to consider and think about what to do with Trump does that

109
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:44,031
Mentally bad thing

110
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:47,359
But I can't operate as it on the assumption that it will

111
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:51,199
Narrows like

112
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:57,855
Yeah it's a possibility but like obsessing and thinking like that is what's going to happen I think

113
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,903
What part of the reason that I

114
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:06,303
2015 Alex

115
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,839
Install himself as the king

116
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:08,863
New Islamic

117
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:10,143
Caliphate of America

118
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:16,799
It looks silly to us because obviously it was but it felt real to them at the time and I know that Trump has given

119
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,335
Ardmore reason

120
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:21,407
Do suspect that's the way he would at least

121
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:27,807
Yeah there's an attack on Attack on the prospect

122
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:28,575
There's that

123
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:34,975
You know there is a ton of complete inability to recognize the legitimacy of any zeddy of his beloved

124
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:40,863
Go about it a hundred percent circumstantial

125
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:44,191
About this little babe

126
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:46,751
But I just don't want to fall into the same trap as

127
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:47,519
Is Alex

128
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,055
Buddies

129
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:54,431
I don't think about that it's not work

130
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:59,807
No one has any idea what would happen beyond all hell would break loose and there's really no point

131
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:02,367
Planning for all hell break loose

132
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:04,159
Cuz what the f*** do you what's the

133
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:08,255
The plan individual-level think you can think about what your plan might be

134
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,887
So in the sex club

135
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:16,447
Alex discusses how

136
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:18,495
Everybody's got a

137
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:19,519
Can I get the word out

138
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:20,543
Bye-bye

139
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,079
Transplant

140
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,991
Reactivity

141
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,551
Live feed of the show from

142
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,367
Comport slideshow

144
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:42,815
They admit the coop

145
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,351
July

146
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:45,887
People

147
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,895
Global Toronto

00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:00,991
CIA

149
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,783
Are the Deep state to believe they can actually

150
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,671
I think Alex just debunked himself

151
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:21,471
He believes that the military will escort them out of the way

152
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:27,103
They got to go on TV and make these announcements to ready the crew

153
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:29,919
Reinforces argument Alex brings up how you breathe

154
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:34,271
The Secret Service about a film mud interview on CNN

155
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,575
The announcement of a clue a coup plot

156
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,599
To kill Trump

157
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,135
Here are the two problem

158
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:45,023
One that still might interview is 3 years old

159
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:45,791
Has been watched

160
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:50,655
It doesn't seem like it was at all because there was no plot

161
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:56,287
The second problem is that Alex talk to the Secret Service about this film mud interview and they did nothing about it

162
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:59,103
Which clearly indicates that the Secret Service did not think

163
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:03,455
This was anything serious really just a guy talking s*** on TV

164
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:10,111
You would think if there was an actual instance of feel about announcing a coup on TV and Alex brief the Secret Service about it

165
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,903
That's a good thing

166
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:12,927
How about everything

167
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:17,791
That is soon as I left that meeting with the Secret Service

168
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:20,863
At least one jerk-off motion was made

169
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:24,959
Right

170
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:25,983
Spread my wings

171
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:32,383
Creative occasion to write a script of what I imagined

172
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:40,831
In front of you there is a script and highlighter highlights

173
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:45,951
Thank you very much Secret Service

174
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:46,975
Play Alex Jones

175
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:47,743
Alright

176
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,559
Scene interior

177
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:55,423
Old-school interrogation room lit by a single overhead light shot in black-and-white

178
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:58,495
Floppy man with a picnic table sweating

179
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:02,079
Holding a candy cigarette in a cup of cocoa he's pretending his coffee

180
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,383
I understand

181
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,663
That you have information

182
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,991
Plot against the president

183
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:15,391
You bet I do this thing goes all the way to the top I'm talking Rothschild Bill Gates Oprah Winfrey you name it

184
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,159
Okay okay okay

185
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,695
She just started

186
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:22,815
Watch CNN that guy's the last living Vanderbilt

187
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:23,839
That's not true

188
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:30,495
A bigger late he's working for the CIA and helped cover up Sandy Hook but my lawyer told me that I should pretend not to believe that last

189
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:32,287
Anderson Cooper

190
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,079
Not directly

191
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,127
But you know he should really take a look at over

192
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:38,943
CNN I got Brian stelter

193
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,247
Pedophile

194
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:45,087
I mean look good looking the way he smiles it's full of humorous

195
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,879
Here look I brought a picture of it

196
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:51,487
Alex hand the agent today by 10

197
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:53,279
That attempts to light is Katey Sagal

198
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:56,095
Brian stelter

199
00:13:56,351 --> 00:14:02,495
Threatened Trump

200
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:09,919
I know I said that the Aether special was going to end today but we got extended until Tuesday

201
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:17,087
Is rare neurological condition called semi voluntary spontaneous advertisements syndrome

202
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,367
Absolutely

203
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:22,719
Chiropractors who pretend

204
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:28,607
Call prescribe me iodine to manage the condition of the University of Eldorado

205
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:34,239
The science is good but the globalist horse the researchers to retract or else they would reveal the location of the gold

206
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:40,639
Okay so what is this half did the Golden City threaten the Press

207
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:42,431
Years of studying the Bible

208
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,967
It's under Mount Rushmore

209
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:50,623
Mr. Jones I think you're thinking of the plot of National Treasure Book of Secrets

210
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:55,487
Now we called you in because you claimed to have information

211
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:57,023
About a credible threat

212
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:58,559
Credible

213
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,095
Against President

214
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:04,703
On CNN

215
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:10,079
Are you sure that he wasn't saying that the difficulty of governing was going to kill Trump

216
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:16,479
Not that a vague entity called the government was going to literally kill this was a joke

217
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:22,367
Mud with sending up the alarm Rising the army of demonic globulus minions heed the call

218
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,671
Okay if the government is going to kill Trump

219
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:28,255
How does an army of demonic globulus minions fact

220
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:31,583
These are demonic Lovelace menu

221
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:37,983
Like like at the dma at the DMV BMV is lousy with globalists

222
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,007
Thank you very much

223
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:45,407
Can you get Bill Gates to stop wearing pink sweaters it really pisses me off

224
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:48,223
My office

225
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,015
Beautiful thank you

226
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,415
Alright

227
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,951
I just made things

228
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:04,351
What really happened

229
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:07,679
You know like literally get into the way that you make

230
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:12,287
I just had an image of Alex sitting under a light in it

231
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:21,247
I know of a plot to kill the magic even in this scenario

232
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,783
He still has to wear Hancock

233
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,063
Cups like they still he's not

234
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:26,623
Convicted he's not accused of any crime but they likes

235
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:29,183
Okay if you're going to tell us about applied together

236
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:32,255
We need you would have all those Hannibal Lecter mask

237
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:38,399
Phil Mudd on this episode

238
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:41,471
I think Alex is getting into dicey territory

239
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:44,287
We

240
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,823
Will kill this guy

241
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,103
CIA

242
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,919
Governments going to kill this guy

243
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:53,247
Telegraph

244
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:57,343
Confidence to their Networks

245
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:58,879
Better than the government

246
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:05,791
To create false whistleblower report

247
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,583
Information

248
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,471
The current to poison the President

249
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:14,239
If you depressed

250
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:21,919
Somebody else does

251
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:28,831
Use the term because he's mock the idea when people talked about him doing it

252
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,623
Is it filmadas engaging in Stowe cast

253
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:31,391
Terrorism

254
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:38,303
Mud went on TV and said that the government was going to kill Trump hoping that someone would hear that message and take it as a sign that they should do it

255
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:42,399
This is really murky territory for Alex

256
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:46,495
You should be introducing is something he's accusing his enemies

257
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:49,311
The problem is that he does this all the time

258
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:55,967
He constantly talks about his enemies should be killed and how they're all going to burn in hell far more graphically in explicitly

259
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:56,735
Even fill mugs

260
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:03,903
Alex is directly asserting did Phil Mudd comments on TV are legally actionable to the point where he met with the secret

261
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:04,927
Service about them

262
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:10,047
Because he was someone wasn't because of

263
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:12,607
Analysis himself belongs

264
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:16,703
Prince music using somebody

265
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:23,103
Alex talks about this stuff, a part of the Lesser magic stuff

266
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:28,223
Global Tattoo announce what they're doing before they do it in order to get magical power out of the rich

267
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:31,295
That's stupid but at least it's not self dammit

268
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,391
To carry out his goals

269
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:40,511
Is it really bad direction for Alex to go down since it heavily implicates his own behavior

270
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:42,047
I would have advised it again

271
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,887
In the in the studio

272
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:47,423
Bail.

273
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:51,775
I mean the only thing that saved him is I don't think I've ever heard him

274
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:58,175
Not by his own b******* as immediately as he was saying it like

275
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:01,503
You don't believe a goddamn word of this you idiot

276
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:03,295
You know it and I know it stop

277
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:10,719
Skip this next part cuz it's pointless

278
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:17,119
Sinon

279
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,167
And I have no idea what he's talking about

280
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:23,519
You get to another one of the big thing so there's the

281
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:28,383
Which is where you announce Akoo

282
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:33,247
There's that narrative you got to have Trevor Noah giving you the sign off before you

283
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:36,319
Gives you the words

284
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,391
That's that's a big narrative and then

285
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:41,183
Another one that he's got going

286
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,207
Is the bike

287
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:45,279
Jon Boat has his book

288
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:47,327
Yes Aunt Alex is not happy

289
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,351
Course

290
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,143
Bolton

291
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:56,543
Call

292
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:03,199
Stupid

293
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:04,735
Why do we say

294
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:06,783
He's a Fox News watcher

295
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,087
What is policies

296
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:12,159
The Trojan Horse

297
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:18,559
It's so funny to hear Alex pretending the Trump just got suckered into hiring because he's a Fox News

298
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:25,215
Infowars because Alex supported the nomination of John Bolton

299
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:42,623
Munchkin

300
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:57,727
That was from March 23rd 2018 Rodger Stone

301
00:20:57,983 --> 00:21:01,823
Directly says is a 30-year long poker buddy with John Bolton

302
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:07,711
So I guess that means Rodger was giving Trump added

303
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:08,735
Interesting

304
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:09,759
Defeat pechenik

305
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:11,551
Askreddit he was supposed to Bolton

306
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:14,623
Listen to Leann consistently but Alex did not listen

307
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:20,256
Alex that Rodger was more important

308
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:22,304
The Trump could use against his shadow enemies

309
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:25,120
Hope I didn't work out so great for everyone

310
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:29,216
And he was always on the right side of this one

311
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:32,032
He was always against Bolt from the gym

312
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:35,360
This is ridiculous

313
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:38,944
Noted national hero

314
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:44,320
When in a position of power to do something about those many impeachable offenses

315
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:45,088
Was like

316
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,112
Nah

317
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:48,416
Go for it

318
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:52,000
Can I suggest there's no

319
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:53,024
Interesting like

320
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:53,792
Hey

321
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:56,864
I thought that this is going to go a different way turned out

322
00:21:57,632 --> 00:22:03,776
What's the problem with him saying that yeah I was led to believe that John Bolton would be someone who PDF

323
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:06,336
Effective as a ratchet

324
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:10,176
Do the information that I got was wrong that's not how it turned up.

325
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:14,016
Absolutely ability to just be wrong

326
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:20,416
Psychic knows everything even when he's wrong he's Trump is always right Everybody's Fool

327
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,976
He knows everything and is the smartest person on the planet

328
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:25,792
And God told him that you should hire

329
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:28,352
But even God is wrong sometimes sure

330
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:29,632
Timaeus

331
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:31,936
I don't I don't exhaust

332
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:32,704
Let's children

333
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,728
Let's just chill

334
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:37,568
So Alex is still also mad about Phil Mudd

335
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:40,384
I complained about him I thought he was mad about empty dirt

336
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,664
Come on now

337
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,200
No

338
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:43,968
Alright

339
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:46,016
Equate vessel bottle

340
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:48,064
Phil Mudd who's actually related

341
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:49,344
Your mud

342
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:50,880
The only other person

343
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:57,280
He's actually related to the Virginia

344
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:58,304
Tormod

345
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:10,080
What's a little bit before but the only evidence I can find at filmadas related to Samuel Mudd is a 2014

346
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:11,360
Tweet from Jake Tapper

347
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:15,712
It might be true that they're related or might not be I don't know I'm not really that concerned

348
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:19,552
There's a sex therapist named Wendy freezing who I've heard of I'm not related to her

349
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:22,624
The comedian named Don Friesen he's not a relative

350
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,928
People have names doesn't always mean

351
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,304
If I am related to Don Friesen I assure you will change my life at all

352
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:36,192
Yeah and either way I really don't think I would care what his great-grandfather

353
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:42,592
I don't think that has any effect on

354
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:45,408
Genetically predisposed to Kelly Preston

355
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:49,504
Oh that's true

356
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,832
Not the only other person charged in the plot to assassinate Lincoln

357
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:56,928
Princeton to David Harold was in the barn with John Wilkes Booth

358
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,512
Harold surrendered the booth did not eventually being shot by boss

359
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:03,072
Austin Corbett the subjective one of the best episodes of the dollar

360
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:06,144
Harold was convicted and sentenced to death by hanging

361
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,936
Longest three co-conspirators

362
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:11,264
He's kind of a big deal because one of them was Mary Surratt

363
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,568
The first woman executed by the US government

364
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:17,920
Three other conspirators were sentenced to life in prison and one got six years

365
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:24,576
Dr. Mudd was pardoned few years later since it wasn't really clear fuse in on the plot or may have just been the Doctor Who's new

366
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:29,440
Who created someone who was in distress who showed up at his house

367
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:30,720
It's not like it was

368
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:32,512
Twitter in 1865

369
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,072
Alex is supposed to be this big history buff

370
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:40,960
But he has clearly demonstrated he has absolutely zero awareness of the details of one of the biggest events in US history

371
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:47,616
I strongly strongly suspect because of Nicolas Cage

372
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:49,664
Ended up in the Second National Treasure movie

373
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:54,016
Because of Alex knows about the Lincoln assassination

374
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:56,576
It's impossible that he would know about Mary Surratt

375
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:57,344
It's

376
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:01,952
What are you what are you paying attention to women in history

377
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,328
What's a guy with the name like Harold

378
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:10,656
Come on

379
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:12,960
Cannot be simultaneously true

380
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:13,984
It's ridiculous.

381
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:18,848
If you're an Infowars listener and you think Alex knows what he's talking about you have to ask yourself

382
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:22,944
How can you f****** something that that seriously and that casually

383
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:28,320
How can you assert a historical payments absolutely usually falsifiable

384
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:29,344
Move on with it

385
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,184
Like the fact that Alex is so comfortable fabricating information about history

386
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:37,024
Like that mud was the only other person convicted in the assassination

387
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,072
That should be a serious red flag

388
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:41,888
Is Alex is capable of that kind of lie

389
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:45,216
Elsa eating as definitive fact that he's just making up

390
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:47,520
A lot of trump

391
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:50,336
Spoiler alert it's almost everything he talks about pretty much

392
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:55,968
Also doctor mode wasn't from Virginia is from Maryland man anyway

393
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,344
Really different state

394
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,416
What the f*** is

395
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:07,744
I don't know why you even look you could just see

396
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:14,144
Samuel Mudd was mixed up in the Lincoln assassination

397
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,448
Pathology

398
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,216
Just

399
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:20,032
John Wilkes Booth and why

400
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:26,432
Why would it just be those two

401
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:32,832
I tried to kill the vice president

402
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:39,232
About the vice-president crime these days come on

403
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,048
Stupid

404
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,672
Marcos

405
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:34,272
So 8:30 on Friday something amazing happened in Alex as explosion

406
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,296
Get him help

407
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:37,856
Is that I don't know

408
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,672
Use making stuff

409
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:43,488
Oh my God here waiting

410
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:49,888
That's weird but then the other thing that I think is really funny is now whenever Alex mentions Hitler in the bunker he has to

411
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:56,288
That's not a different thing I know they looked at similar

412
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:02,432
Are you just looking at

413
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:04,992
Yep I do like that

414
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:07,296
He is so self-conscious

415
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,648
For years he's been fine talking about Hitler in the bunker but

416
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:16,000
Lexus

417
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:18,304
Has made all of these people look

418
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:23,936
As pathetic as they always have been such a bad time for them

419
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:35,968
But I tell you one of the most

420
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,528
Nice

421
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:39,296
Steve pieczenik

422
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,064
Flipped out on air

423
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:42,624
We know

424
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:44,160
Is a nasty little

425
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:48,512
Here's another example of Alex

426
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:57,472
Showcase of the exact same

427
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:59,008
He doesn't understand the word

428
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:00,032
And what they mean

429
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:04,384
He thinks it's inter Blossom here is an insult because the word turd isn't

430
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,968
There's a very specific term being used in a very specific history

431
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:12,576
Turn Blossom was a nickname that George W bush affectionately gave to Karl Road

432
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:16,672
Because of his masterful ability to take a piece of s*** and bring a flower out of

433
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:17,440
Metaphorically

434
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:20,512
Turn Blossom is also if it's not an insult

435
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:25,888
Really only has a connotation of admiration particularly in the realm of politics

436
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:32,288
It's also the term pretty flower that grows from manure to isn't the good basis for an insult

437
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:36,384
I get the chance to compare the s*** but the flower is the contradict

438
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,664
Can of the s*** not it's a

439
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,432
Extension

440
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:41,760
Blossom is something that's beautiful growing out something shity

441
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:45,088
Alex just heard the term and assumes that it's something for Jordan

442
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:51,232
Much like you did because it involves poop

443
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:52,000
Complementing

444
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:54,560
Alex almost never knows what he's talking about

445
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:56,864
Yeah but the bottle fired matter

446
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,424
The modifier nasty over text

447
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:03,264
Even if it is a

448
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:08,896
Flower that blooms out of a turd if it's nasty it's still a nasty flower the realm of politics

449
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:12,480
Term only applies to George W bush talking affection

450
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:18,880
Currently about Carl Russell is a nasty piece of s*** from from George W bush

451
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:20,672
Show me pictures of nasty piece of s***

452
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:24,768
Call him back

453
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,072
That's a compliment

454
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:29,888
Imagine Florida

455
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:35,008
I disagree with your perspective and I'm definitely right

456
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:37,568
So

457
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:42,688
Roses and a chessboard

458
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:46,528
That you didn't realize had occult significance

459
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:50,112
And he's a little bit

460
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:53,696
He wants to drink with your eyes

461
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:55,232
Also

462
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:57,280
You're probably asking who is that

463
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:02,400
Auburn

464
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,192
Ali

465
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:06,752
Robert Ely

466
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:07,520
That's right

467
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:13,920
Robert E Lee statue

468
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:20,320
What else strong message to place the skull and roses

469
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:22,880
Robert Ely

470
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:24,416
I was being too

471
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:28,000
Let me be more out front what I wanted to say with the

472
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:31,072
Flower the skull and the chessboard

473
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:32,096
You wanted to be

474
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:34,144
Deeply esoteric

475
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:37,728
A little blonde

476
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:39,520
It's very little blood

477
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:43,104
This turns into a thing where Alex

478
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:45,408
I don't think he's being defensive

479
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:51,808
But at the same time he's trying to rationalize

480
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:03,584
Mad statues look at me I have a statue

481
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,912
Why do you get mad at me and give me free Pride come take down this statue

482
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:08,704
That's largely strategy

483
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,776
Alex is a different rationalization for why

484
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,336
Robert E Lee is cool

485
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:20,224
Nothing on there

486
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:24,064
There were articles

487
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:25,600
Thousands over the years

488
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:27,904
Because he fought armies

489
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:31,232
1521

490
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:36,096
Buddy the north love the racism to

491
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:40,960
Molino shoes

492
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:43,008
Respected

493
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:46,592
Carriers

494
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:47,360
Military base

495
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:48,896
Dollar General

496
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:53,248
Why

497
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,272
Russia

498
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,576
That doesn't sound right

499
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:58,880
You know who they studying

500
00:32:59,136 --> 00:32:59,648
Robert Ely

501
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:05,792
Civil War

502
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:06,816
Tight shorts

503
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:08,864
Sure buddy

504
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:16,800
And the Civil War was not about slavery was not Western expand

505
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:25,760
I can suggest a group or even further and Underdog and I would be slaves

506
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:31,136
Unless the underdog is the person on

507
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:34,208
In Chains

508
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,488
Underdog

509
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:43,168
I don't know I think generally speaking in terms of like the big picture siding without shoes is not white

510
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:47,008
Are you sure I pretty

511
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:53,408
Second point I'd like to cite my unimputable sore

512
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:58,016
Course one of the greatest story ever lived Alexander

513
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:04,416
Listen to Archie

514
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,232
He's trying to make

515
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:14,144
Whatever the situation of the world were black people are rightly asserting their right to equal treatment and conversation

516
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,704
History of post-slavery America comes up

517
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:23,104
Invalidate

518
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,272
Ozark

519
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,088
However when it comes to defending the Confederacy

520
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:36,416
Needs to justify his absurd supportive

521
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:38,208
Confederate generals

522
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:40,768
Without sounding racist

523
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:43,840
He's quick to point out that the Civil War wasn't about slavery

524
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:49,984
Often say that was about states rights of the economy both of which are just words

525
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,288
Deny the Confederacy seceded over slavery

526
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:58,944
Sherwood states rights but the particular right of the state where those in question was

527
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,504
In their whole little secession thing

528
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:08,672
The economy but the economic concern was being able to maintain an economy that relied on slavery

529
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:11,744
Free labor does help that's all obfuscation

530
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:13,792
I'm in this instance it's no different

531
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:16,864
Civil War was about western expansion

532
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:19,168
What do you think he means by that

533
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:24,544
Could it possibly be about whether or not duly admitted states that the union would be slave or free

534
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:30,176
Missouri Compromise Advanced slavery west of the Missouri west of Missouri

535
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:31,200
What are your problem

536
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:32,992
For any of the Confederate States

537
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:39,392
People who are landowners there

538
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:42,464
New Lancer western expansion yes of course

539
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,536
Uber at the bottom

540
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:51,168
Alex knows damn well what the Civil War was about you can tell because he's explicit about it being about slavery

541
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:54,752
What do you want black people to shut up and think white people for ending slavery

542
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:59,872
Ignoring the fact that he claims to literally be his ancestors who he said on many occasions

543
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:05,504
Fought for the Confederacy they were fighting for states rights to keep slaves

544
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,600
Not for slavery. It's a little luck

545
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:10,624
Constitutional

546
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,208
The little is Constitution that might be

547
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:16,000
So Alex

548
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:22,400
Talking more about Robert E Lee

549
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:28,800
This one confused me a little bit about what Alex was trying to say and then I figured it out

550
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:29,568
Very poorly

551
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:32,640
Property

552
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,016
He's one of the greatest generals

553
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:39,040
Name of the greater

554
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:40,832
George Washington

555
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:43,648
Washington had no genetic

556
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:45,696
What

557
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:46,976
What what

558
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:48,768
Progeny

559
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:55,168
So he grew up

560
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,728
Is his father

561
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:05,920
Robert Ely

562
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,200
Wasn't amazing

563
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:14,624
I have no idea what the f*** Alex was trying to say there but it sounded

564
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,392
Washington

565
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:17,696
Just isn't true

566
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:22,560
Yeah children and Patsy custis

567
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:23,584
Also just

568
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:28,192
Stefano be impossible cuz the Washington and gravity leaves lives didn't overlap share

569
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:33,056
Robert Ely married Mary Anna Randolph custis Who was the

570
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:36,384
Daughter of John Costas

571
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,432
Granddaughter of George Washington

572
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:44,576
Direct lineage

573
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:51,232
The fact that he's speaking so on clearly here makes me pretty worried that he doesn't know the full story

574
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:55,328
George Washington

575
00:37:55,840 --> 00:38:01,728
After his father-in-law died took on the responsibility of custis family Plantation

576
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:02,496
Includes

577
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:05,312
His father-in-law's wheels that the slaves were to be

578
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:09,664
Be free within five years and after five years we did for those slaves

579
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:11,456
You did wait until the last minute

580
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:13,760
There's a good pizza in the Atlantic

581
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:20,160
Take the deconstructor the myth of generally being a good man just wanted to keep the country together

582
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:21,440
He was not

583
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:23,488
Quote

584
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:26,304
Leave heavy hand on the Arlington Virginia Plantation

585
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:32,704
Prior rights nearly led to a slave revolt

586
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,728
Previous Masters.

587
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:37,568
And we had engaged in a dubious legal interpretation of his will

588
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:39,616
In order to keep them as property

589
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:43,968
One that lasted until the Virginia courts forced him to free them

590
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,760
You didn't want to free the slaves

591
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:52,160
Instead he had that he had inherited but they made him do it

592
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:53,696
Emerald in water free his slaves

593
00:38:53,952 --> 00:39:00,096
Well that's one of the things that all these people talk about like he freed the slaves that he inherited together

594
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:04,960
I know I literally because I remember cuz I read that piece in the Atlantic

595
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:08,544
And I remember like I have this huge flash back to what I was in

596
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:12,640
Fourth grade

597
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:16,224
And hearing really really nice s*** about Robert

598
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,760
The whole f****** time

599
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:20,064
Like it was insane

600
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:22,624
Especially looking back like

601
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:25,696
Wait a second why are you guys spending

602
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:32,096
A quarter of the Civil War thing on how great the losing General cuz it kind of have to I don't know.

603
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:38,240
Switch was actually again

604
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:40,800
Tradition IP Kostas Plantation

605
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:43,104
That was his innovation

606
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:46,432
Brothers Atlantic Ardell

607
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:51,808
Leave cruelty as a slave master was not confirmed to physical punish

608
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:53,600
In reading the man

609
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:57,184
And the historian Elizabeth Brown Pryor's portrait of Lee through his writing

610
00:39:57,696 --> 00:40:03,584
Playwrights that ruptured E Washington custis tradition of respecting slave families

611
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,632
By hiring the other Plantation

612
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:11,008
By 1860 he broken up every family but one on the estate

613
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,336
Some of whom we've been together since Mount Vernon days

614
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:20,992
The separation of slave families was one of the most unfathomably devastating aspect of slavery

615
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:24,576
Is regarded him as quote the worst man I ever seen

616
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,368
And that's not all

617
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:30,720
When we was in charge of the army of Northern Virginia

618
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:35,072
Enslaved free black Americans and brought them back to the South as property

619
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:41,728
Prior rights the quote evidence links virtually every infantry and Cavalry unit in Lee's army to the

620
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:47,872
The Abduction of free black Americans with the activity under the supervision of senior officers

621
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:50,688
Robert E Lee is at best a horrible piece

622
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:54,272
Piece of s*** and Alex is not defending him cuz he's good at Battle strategy

623
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:58,624
Because he was the commander of a racist Army that tried to overthrow the American government

624
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,416
Because I couldn't own people anymore

625
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:01,440
So I can

626
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:04,256
Alex Jones to this is ridiculous

627
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:05,536
8 is revisionist

628
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:12,192
Nonsense normal slave owners

629
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:17,056
That's how awful this guy things in the world

630
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:19,104
And he's worse than them

631
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,944
Talking about Headlights

632
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,736
He's in trouble is right I mean

633
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:27,552
There's going to be some bad stuff, difficult obelus

634
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:30,624
Guitar

635
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:37,792
You've got these commies in the Seattle autonomous zone right

636
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:48,800
Chinese

637
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:56,479
Remove when they overthrow until prom

638
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:58,271
Or drugging up

639
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:05,951
Don't kill Ron Paul

640
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:14,911
I'm not saying don't

641
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:21,055
Analyze their tax profile talk radio

642
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:23,103
Alright alright so Bundy

643
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:25,663
Occupy National 40 National Park

644
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:28,991
Totally fine

645
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:32,831
Absolutely no problem

646
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:35,391
Some people without

647
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:45,375
They're the ones that the Chinese have chosen to assassinate Ron Paul and

648
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:52,031
So there's the distraction for the kids come in and take out Ron Paul Alex Jones

649
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:58,431
System is like we got to figure out what's going on with Chaz before weekend

650
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:02,527
Security

651
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:03,807
Convoluted

652
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:06,111
So Alex gets pretty mad about Tim Cook

653
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:11,231
In the middle of this episode about China

654
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:14,559
And how they treat Muslim

655
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:22,751
Weider labor

656
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:26,591
Report business hours

657
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:32,735
Brands using uighur Muslim forced labor

658
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:34,015
In fact

659
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:38,367
Allegedly using

660
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:40,671
Blinking Muslim slave camps

661
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:51,167
Got a bozo haircut

662
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:52,959
Read about it

663
00:43:55,519 --> 00:44:01,663
So Alex is right I mean not the being of bigoted

664
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:06,527
Very serious issues that need to be addressed about the state of China Muslim population

665
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:10,879
Never trust Alex to be a credible voice on the subject

666
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:16,255
He can be right about a central point and also be completely wrong and detestable at the same time

667
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:19,839
One of the main reasons is because he doesn't mean what he says

668
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:25,471
Here he's trying to use the plight of the weaker population in China as a prop to attack China

669
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:28,543
Protect the actual people he's talking about

670
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:29,311
But he does

671
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:32,639
You don't give a s*** about these people pass the point you can use them

672
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:35,199
Is a blunt instrument to attack his imagined enemies

673
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:37,247
And I know that because of this

674
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:40,831
Something he said less than a month ago on May 26th

675
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:42,111
Michigan

676
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:44,671
From London to Austin

677
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:47,487
Rio de Janeiro

678
00:44:58,239 --> 00:44:58,751
Do your thing

679
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:05,151
When Alex wants to he cares deeply about his treatment of Muslim

680
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:11,039
When he wants to start his outrageous islamophobia and convince his audience that Islam is trying to take over the West

681
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:13,599
Just trying to do their thing

682
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:20,255
It is a really good case example for why even if you kind of agree with the main point behind without to saying you can't

683
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:22,047
Ever let yourself agree with them

684
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:23,839
He doesn't agree with himself

685
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:27,679
And if you ever consider him an ally because of a point you seem to agree on

686
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:29,727
It'll look like a mistake in hindsight

687
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:34,335
All the left-leaning people thought that George W Bush come to mine

688
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:41,503
No matter the subject you're passionate about and find yourself thinking Alex is right about whether it's Bush hating or APA

689
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:45,343
Opposition to civil asset forfeiture

690
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:49,183
You will always be able to find a smarter more credible Source than him

691
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:50,719
On every single

692
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:52,511
People who actually care

693
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:53,791
Do they mean what they say

694
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:57,887
We're more than just intellectual sadist trying to take advantage of an audio

695
00:45:58,143 --> 00:45:59,423
It's like that's all he's doing

696
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:00,703
You can pretend to

697
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:03,775
Karen

698
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:05,823
Cuz Islam's trying to take over

699
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:09,407
Yeah it's

700
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:12,479
Makes me think so much of this

701
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:14,015
Forest

702
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:20,927
Deference given to so many politicians by the media and the

703
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:23,231
You know you report what about this

704
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:24,767
Says or something like that

705
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:27,327
There's no accounting for bad faith

706
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:29,119
Like I don't believe

707
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:30,143
A f****** word Mitchell

708
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:30,911
McConnell says

709
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:35,007
Even if Mitch McConnell said literally everything that I believe

710
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:37,567
Straight into a camera and said we're going to do it

711
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:38,591
I don't care

712
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:44,735
I don't believe a thing you say you're acting in bad faith you don't get the protections of your words

713
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:48,319
When you're clearly acting in bad faith I guess what Alex does

714
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:49,855
All the time and that's

715
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:53,439
Kind of

716
00:46:53,951 --> 00:47:00,095
Because you can't really argue with the conclusion that you know

717
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:01,631
Made in China absolutely

718
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:05,471
You can't sign up for his version of it cuz it'll take you down the road

719
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:07,007
You don't want to be on

720
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:08,799
That isn't what you signed up for

721
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:11,615
This leads to

722
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:15,967
Describe is an intensely homophobic discussion tobacco

723
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:17,759
If you complaining about

724
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:21,087
Tim Cook Apple work with plays

725
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:22,623
Clip of Tim Cook

726
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:24,415
And it just turns into a

727
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:28,511
Preoccupied with the fact that Tim Cook is gay

728
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:30,047
It's great

729
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:31,583
Childish

730
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:33,631
Tim Cook

731
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:34,655
Virtuous

732
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:51,039
Everyone

733
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:55,135
Justice and equality

734
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:57,695
Call chirotouch a on Hill

735
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:03,071
I'm on 12 hits of ecstasy right now

736
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:07,679
Newsom

737
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:11,519
Okay if I run Spokane

738
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:18,431
So I mean

739
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:21,759
If he's working on a new impression

740
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:28,415
There's a terrible impression

741
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:30,719
It's deeply homophobic

742
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:31,487
Childish

743
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:33,023
Disgusting

744
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:35,071
Yeah Penny managed to offend

745
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:37,375
I mean that was bigotry on

746
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:39,167
Just every

747
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:43,263
What's interesting to me is it like it goes on for a while

748
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:45,055
It's basically the same thing over and over again

749
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:47,615
Just saying

750
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:50,175
Every time he gets to the end of the wrif

751
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:52,223
I'm sorry I'm sorry

752
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:58,623
He doesn't do that as much lately as I used to do that quite a bit

753
00:48:58,879 --> 00:49:01,695
Is going off

754
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:05,791
It seems like that I haven't seen in awhile

755
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:08,863
Probably meaningless doesn't signify anything

756
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:10,911
So he does that outbreak

757
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:12,191
Comes back

758
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:14,239
And then he's going to hit some of these like

759
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:15,007
Big

760
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:16,031
Topix

761
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:23,967
Only watch it halfway through

762
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:26,015
This is much

763
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:27,295
Hollywood star

764
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:29,343
Booking camp

765
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:35,487
You would know

766
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:41,119
Apologize

767
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:42,143
They're going to be better

768
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:47,263
If you don't like that video why are you wasting your time

769
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:49,823
Like what what's the what's the point

770
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:57,247
Did you have any instinct to bring it up and waste our time talking about it okay

771
00:49:57,503 --> 00:50:00,831
It wasn't a thought I had people I wasn't like here's what I'm going to do

772
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:02,879
I'm going to derail this conversation

773
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:05,951
Apropos of nothing

774
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:08,255
White liberal celebrities

775
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:13,631
I mean like he's pretending this is like world leaders listen to show

776
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:16,191
He's he's taking his time to complain about

777
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:17,983
Celebrity videos

778
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:19,007
Emily

779
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:25,151
Sure I made this plenty of criticism if you want to tweet something go for it

780
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:26,687
Compared to what

781
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:27,967
Recovering baby

782
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:29,503
Views himself

783
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:32,831
And the fact that he's like I tried to watch it twice why

784
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:34,879
I don't try to watch it one

785
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:43,071
I don't know who.

786
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:43,839
Who cares

787
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:45,119
Samantha Gerard

788
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:47,167
This blew my mind

789
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:48,447
My my

790
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:54,847

Twitter

792
00:50:56,127 --> 00:51:01,247
I don't think we're not going to waste our time

793
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:04,319
I don't care still don't care either

794
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:06,111
So

795
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:10,975
I'm not even going to try to set this up

796
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:12,767
Coming in and out of break but it was

797
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:13,791
Fairy autoplay

798
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:20,703

Man

808
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:15,231
If Infowars had a booty

809
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:20,607
It'll be big

810
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:23,167
You would not listen to music

811
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:24,959
Just.

812
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:26,239
You're not allowed to have

813
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:27,519
Cuz it's not

814
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:31,359

Rubber this visit family show with the shake it like a salt shaker

816
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:36,991
This is the out-of-context drop from Today Show

817
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:39,807
Lesbian orgy with John Bolton

818
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:52,863
I love your identity sit around thinking about what it would be like to be an orgy with John Holt to try to get a boner

819
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:59,775
It's like one of those High School camping trips you know everybody's somebody's like do you believe in God

820
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:05,151
Do you ever wonder what it would be like to be in orgy with John Bolton trying to get a hard-on

821
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:08,991
Considered

822
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:11,295
Now I'm considering it

823
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:12,063
How's it going

824
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:19,231
Exactly like him

825
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:21,023
I think

826
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:27,423
I want to question.

827
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:32,031
Let's talk about a rock

828
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:34,335
If you're in an orgy with Rodger Stone

829
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:35,615
1

830
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:36,383
You expect

831
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:38,431
To see him there so you're already

832
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:44,319
How do you do even if even if your Nike I didn't know Rodger Stone was going to be here like it was going to be

833
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:50,719
And even if it's like a mask affair

834
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:55,839
So

835
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:56,607
I mean

836
00:53:57,887 --> 00:54:04,031
Yeah that was that was derailing a little bit on my part I apologize but I needed to hear that out of conflicts drop

837
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:07,103
Anytime Alex

838
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:12,479
Stranahan's on his interview sucks

839
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:15,295
Explaining that like the globalist what they're doing

840
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:18,623
Is there taking this domestic issue

841
00:54:18,879 --> 00:54:20,415
We should be I don't know

842
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:26,815
Black people being murdered by the police saying it to their

843
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:30,655
We don't really need to talk about because I don't really care about his argument

844
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:33,727
You'll see why I kept this club in pretty quick

845
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:35,519
Internal issue

00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:38,847

Alex's eating

00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:54,719
It's easier to having lunch

851
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:57,791
Lee Stranahan

852
00:54:58,047 --> 00:55:00,351
You how do you not feel incredibly

853
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:05,471
I can't imagine because I really

854
00:55:05,727 --> 00:55:08,031
Kohl's

855
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:14,431
Yeah I can't even imagine it either cuz like your time is valuable

856
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:17,247
Joseph company

857
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:18,015
Infertile

858
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:24,415
If you are somebody who's likely

859
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:26,463
Valuable professional

860
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:28,255

Open sign

865
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:54,367
Disrespecting the breeze to be on Infowars that isn't that guy who hit stuff with a hammer

866
00:55:54,623 --> 00:56:00,767
I don't actually know is that guy is cool or not

867
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:03,839
Ask you to come on and you make a joke out of it

868
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:05,375
I don't hate you

869
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:06,911
But everybody else

870
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:09,727
F*** off you deserve to have a sandwich exact

871
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:14,079
I spoken too soon I forgot

872
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:17,407
Stranahan has a gigantic new project

873
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:20,223
And I respect the hell out of this

874
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:22,271
I probably want a booking

875
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:25,599
Close TV it's 11

876
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:27,647
My Twitter feed

877
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:33,279
That's not a TV show that's not a streaming on Twitter

878
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:34,559
Wow

879
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:41,983
Alex talks to leave for a little bit it's mostly about like Soros is running black lives matter and all this like

880
00:56:44,031 --> 00:56:44,543
Now

881
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:46,079
Things get real interest

882
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:47,359
Because

883
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:51,711
Okay so now we are on hold

884
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:53,503
But Alex needs to talk to Steve

885
00:56:54,783 --> 00:56:58,367
Talk about Alex's is going to introduce him here

886
00:56:58,623 --> 00:56:59,903
Which is so pathetic

887
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:00,927
Attic

888
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:06,815
Short notice

889
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:08,863
Critical almost broke

890
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:13,215
You didn't mention

891
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:14,495
I told him

892
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:17,055
Alex can't cop to the fact that he was

893
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:23,455
F****** wrong you can't do it

894
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:27,295
Text to be against Bolton

895
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:30,111
And Alex did not acknowledge

896
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:31,647
Not ever

897
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:32,415
Cowardly

898
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:33,695
You can never lose

899
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:35,487
You can never be wrong

900
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:40,863
You can never admit for one second that you had something to learn because when he was born

901
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:42,399
He knew everything

902
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:44,191
Steven

903
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:46,239
Some s*** to talk about John Bolton

904
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:50,335
Victory lap prestige

905
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:55,199
It's pretty great

906
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:02,111
Manipulate

907
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:06,207
So you have a mutual

908
00:58:10,815 --> 00:58:12,351
Fishing is a sexual activity

909
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:17,215
Many many years ago in New York

910
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:22,079
Please don't

911
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:22,847
Disagree

912
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:23,871
1

913
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:28,735
First I'm going to need you to confirm or deny whether or not there was a video of Reagan getting paid

914
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:35,391
And to I want to know more about what Bolton was doing at that f****** with Trump and

915
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:36,415
Whitestone wasn't there

916
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:39,743
I guess I don't know

917
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:40,767
I guess Bolton

918
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:45,375
Got sexual blackmail on tropical

919
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:47,679
I don't know man

920
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:54,847
These sorts of things are like

921
00:58:55,103 --> 00:58:55,871
Yeah right

922
00:58:56,383 --> 00:59:00,223
I mean I guess if you have sexual blackmail on Trump

923
00:59:00,479 --> 00:59:04,319
Assume it's in that book right now there's no

924
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:06,367
Treasonous

925
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:09,183
Treason and then there's revealing that you cheated on your wife

926
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:10,207
Okay

927
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:15,071
There is a code of ethics

928
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:21,215
Talking nonsense

929
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:21,983
I don't I don't know

930
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:25,055
I like I like that Steve still swinging

931
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:31,711
Sexual blackmail is way more damaging than

932
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:37,087
Revealing treason I do I do appreciate the blackmail standards are very

933
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:43,487
That right

934
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:55,007
Well it seems like he should be implicating himself in the very treason that he's describing

935
00:59:55,263 --> 00:59:58,335
On account of him watching it and not doing it about it

936
00:59:58,591 --> 01:00:01,151
If you're committing if you watch somebody commit treason

937
01:00:02,431 --> 01:00:08,575
You commit treason he told the lawyer I'm not part of this or something so fine

938
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:13,183
Next to somebody committing murder and they were talking about

939
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:15,999
How can I help

940
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:20,863
As long as you certify with a lawyer that like

941
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:23,167
Miss Murder

942
01:00:24,191 --> 01:00:25,215
Okay okay

943
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:30,335
Steve's got this idea that has got sexual blackmail on Trump

944
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:32,639
Any further

945
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:36,223
But Lee Stranahan still there

946
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:37,759
He comes in

947
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:40,831
With what I think is the most exciting piece

948
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:44,927
Of Juicy right-wing media gossip

949
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:47,999
This is exciting

950
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:54,911
Lee's talking about like Steve Bannon

951
01:00:57,727 --> 01:00:58,495
Destroyer

952
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:00,799
Notice

953
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:01,567
But this is

954
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:03,103
People involved

955
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:06,687
Steve is working with Mike cernovich

956
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:13,855
To destroy

957
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:14,623
You

958
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:19,999
When those guys were on the network

959
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:26,399
Destroying yourself

960
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:28,447
You could not be more right

961
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:34,079
Steve you couldn't have been more right

962
01:01:34,335 --> 01:01:37,663
He's also talking about

963
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:44,319
Hate these people they're all envious of you because

964
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:48,159
I want to be that person in Destroy them. Make them able to do

965
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:50,463
Big flattering cup

966
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:51,743
Alright

967
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:53,279
Owleez coming in

968
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:56,607
It's Steve Bannon is working with Jack Purcell

969
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:03,775
He was eating a sandwich put you on home

970
01:02:04,031 --> 01:02:05,055
For stupid

971
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:07,871
To talk about both having sex with black men

972
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:12,479
This man how dare you I just love the idea

973
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:14,271
Spine

974
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:18,623
If I could do this all over again

975
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:20,415
The script of bee

976
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:33,727
I'll do is I'll go to Comet Ping Pong Pizza

977
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:37,055
Define demonic activity and then I'll go get on info

978
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:38,591
I love it

979
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:40,895
Yes okay

980
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:45,503
What a group of losers

981
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:50,367
Losers

982
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:54,463
I can't I mean

983
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:57,279
Obviously potential of

984
01:02:57,535 --> 01:02:58,815
Other people getting hurt

985
01:02:59,071 --> 01:03:00,863
In process is high

986
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:03,167
But I love the idea of there

987
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:04,447
Being like

988
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:07,263
A rogue's gallery or Justice League

989
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:15,455
Because they take his place or something

990
01:03:16,735 --> 01:03:22,879
Just how awful the Algonquin Table

991
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:30,559
Sufferable

992
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:31,583
God is fair

993
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:38,239
Like it really ends up becoming a thing where like leads

994
01:03:38,495 --> 01:03:39,263
Steve or Josh

995
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:41,567
Sucking up to Alex

996
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:44,639
Flattering him to a level that is almost

997
01:03:45,151 --> 01:03:46,687
It's kind of gross to listen to

998
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:48,223
Ali Askari

999
01:03:50,783 --> 01:03:51,551
I'll tell you why

1000
01:03:55,647 --> 01:03:56,415
Ucreate

1001
01:03:57,951 --> 01:03:58,463
Jealousy

1002
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:07,423
To be clear this is Steve restating his points yet

1003
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:09,215
Various

1004
01:04:09,983 --> 01:04:10,751
You're very funny

1005
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:13,055
And at the same time you're very serious

1006
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:14,847
You created

1007
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:17,663
Millions of people who enjoy what you do

1008
01:04:18,175 --> 01:04:18,687
That is

1009
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:22,271
The sociopaths

1010
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:26,623
Self-aggrandizing

1011
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:39,167
There's other reasons for

1012
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:45,567
People not liking people you just mentioned are absolutely

1013
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:49,407
And there is no one else around

1014
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:55,039
You do understand the people think it's cuz they Envy

1015
01:04:55,295 --> 01:04:59,135
Cuz I know yours in cuz they said they're not just jealous

1016
01:04:59,391 --> 01:05:01,951
It's cuz you're too good man

1017
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:08,095
That's why you're not going to get JFL

1018
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:09,631
It's silly

1019
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:13,983
Oh God I wish I would have got this it was in the middle of stuff that you

1020
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:14,751
Work

1021
01:05:17,567 --> 01:05:18,591
A 2-second

1022
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:20,895
For a 10 minute clinic

1023
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:26,783
Steve

1024
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:33,183
He's busy baby

1025
01:05:34,207 --> 01:05:40,351
Now that's some drunk s*** right

1026
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:41,375
I don't think it's

1027
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:42,399
Drunk coming

1028
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:44,191
Steve I think

1029
01:05:45,727 --> 01:05:47,263
The unhinged

1030
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:49,055
Hospital

1031
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:56,735
Last clip here and Steve loose

1032
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:01,855
I mean I don't know what this is

1033
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:05,439
I have to believe that Steve called Alexandra's like

1034
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:06,719
I mean come on

1035
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:07,999
I was right about both

1036
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:12,607
I'm going to come on and go

1037
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:15,935
But Lee Stranahan still on for a couple minutes

1038
01:06:16,191 --> 01:06:17,215
Afterwards

1039
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:19,519
And he has this really

1040
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:21,055
Shity idea

1041
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:24,127
Is do

1042
01:06:24,383 --> 01:06:25,407
Bass wants him to do

1043
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:28,479
Hardin Manor

1044
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:30,527
Because man

1045
01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:34,367
What's going on with Russia

1046
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:35,903
He was trying to warn Trump

1047
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:40,767
Face

1048
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:42,815
That's exactly right

1049
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:47,423
Yeah that's what they should do that should be in people's faces

1050
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:50,239
Personally

1051
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:52,287
Leeor Alexandra

1052
01:06:53,311 --> 01:06:59,455
Similar circles

1053
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:01,503
The only thing to work at Breitbart

1054
01:07:01,759 --> 01:07:05,343
So like

1055
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:07,903
Otherwise it doesn't

1056
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:09,951
Make any sense to me

1057
01:07:10,463 --> 01:07:13,791
Chardon why you would say out loud

1058
01:07:14,047 --> 01:07:17,375
I mean if I had to be a cynical minded person about it

1059
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:20,703
I would say it's some of the same reasons

1060
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:21,983
Want to

1061
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:23,263
Pardon Rodger

1062
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:25,567
The night is that they know a lot

1063
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:26,591
Totally

1064
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:28,383
You don't want them

1065
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:33,503
Just spell the kind of

1066
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:36,831
Guess but it blows up

1067
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:38,623
If

1068
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:42,463
Not the entire ecosystem

1069
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:47,071
But particularly that of Alex and

1070
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:49,887
Vewlix sycophantically Pro Trump

1071
01:07:50,143 --> 01:07:56,287
Especially people who associate with Alex because Rodger was basically running it for a while

1072
01:07:56,543 --> 01:07:58,591
Have a vested interest

1073
01:07:59,103 --> 01:08:01,919
And someone like Rodger never be hottest

1074
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:05,247
And I'm sure it's similar but without the like

1075
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:08,063
Media focus with metaphors

1076
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:11,135
It's your wild to me because

1077
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:20,607
Yeah he did that s*** man you know it and I know it he's a bad dude and if you don't think that he did that

1078
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:21,375
That should

1079
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:22,911
Don't stick your neck out for him

1080
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:25,215
He's done all the other s***

1081
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:31,871
What does it work for Trump being president we could have got him on so much more s***

1082
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:39,295
Work together there consulting firm predict taters for years

1083
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:42,623
In prison when they were nine

1084
01:08:43,135 --> 01:08:44,927
I don't know how they got to this far

1085
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:45,695
Night

1086
01:08:45,951 --> 01:08:46,975
Team

1087
01:08:47,487 --> 01:08:53,631
Alright Nora put minors in prison

1088
01:08:56,447 --> 01:09:02,591
So I come to the end of this and this episode is

1089
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:06,687
Made it by the fact that on Thursday Alex's preoccupied

1090
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:09,503
With this video from this side

1091
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:13,855
Completely falls off on Friday

1092
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:20,255
He's now preoccupied with an interview on The Daily Show

1093
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:22,815
There's a very minimal amount of coherent

1094
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:23,839
Do this

1095
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:24,863
You can't

1096
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:28,191
You can't be that obsessed with that video and then just

1097
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:28,959
Forget about it

1098
01:09:29,215 --> 01:09:31,263
I'd like at least mention it

1099
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:32,543
Does he mention

1100
01:09:33,055 --> 01:09:33,823
I don't I mean

1101
01:09:35,615 --> 01:09:37,151
I would have remembered if you did

1102
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:42,015
If he did it was in such passing that it was yet important at all

1103
01:09:42,527 --> 01:09:43,807
Yeah it's pretty it's pretty tough

1104
01:09:45,343 --> 01:09:45,855
You know what I think

1105
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:48,671
I think there's a possibility that he recognizes it like

1106
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:51,743
There's nothing to do on that front today

1107
01:09:52,511 --> 01:09:58,655
It'll be there for awhile let's focus on trying to build something

1108
01:09:58,911 --> 01:10:00,703
Pulling out of his Biden Daily Show thing

1109
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:03,775
Right to the point where

1110
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:09,151
It's another plate we're spinning

1111
01:10:09,407 --> 01:10:11,199
It does feel a little bit jarring

1112
01:10:11,455 --> 01:10:12,479
To be like

1113
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:14,015
They're killing

1114
01:10:14,271 --> 01:10:17,855
F****** people in hospitals and this video proves it

1115
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:24,511
And then it just be like a B on The Daily Show

1116
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:29,119
Belief in what it is you're saying there's no possible way that you can spend a whole show on

1117
01:10:29,631 --> 01:10:30,143
All

1118
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:34,495
Doctors are murdering people for money and then the next day

1119
01:10:35,007 --> 01:10:36,799
You see what Biden said on The Daily Show

1120
01:10:37,055 --> 01:10:40,383
The biggest story of the world of doctors are murdering people

1121
01:10:40,895 --> 01:10:42,687
I should be and that's kind of a towel but they're not

1122
01:10:43,711 --> 01:10:47,551
Most important thing on this episode

1123
01:10:47,807 --> 01:10:48,319
Thanks

1124
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:52,927
They'd only two people were charged in the assassination of Mike

1125
01:10:56,255 --> 01:10:58,815
It's so revealing

1126
01:10:59,071 --> 01:11:02,399
Like I would say that the assassination of Abraham Lincoln is

1127
01:11:02,655 --> 01:11:08,287
Or there's a lot of very important events that shaped American history

1128
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:12,127
You know his vice president was really trustworthy

1129
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:14,687
I think

1130
01:11:14,943 --> 01:11:21,087
I think I think sober Isaac Clarity you could say that it's probably kopke

1131
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:27,231
So I just think it's

1132
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:30,303
Doesn't know

1133
01:11:31,071 --> 01:11:35,167
That story at all how many people were charged

1134
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:41,823
And that's the only other person

1135
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:46,431
Cuz I didn't know

1136
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:47,967
I don't know if

1137
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:51,551
You would know I don't know what everyone's awareness Bass

1138
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:55,135
I would assume that you would have known that it wasn't just two people

1139
01:11:55,647 --> 01:12:01,791
Oh yeah I know there were are there were up I mean Mary Surratt is also a very important thing gets taught in history

1140
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:08,191
Woman murdered by the United States and it's such a piece of the story of the Lincoln assassin

1141
01:12:09,471 --> 01:12:13,055
Seems impossible to educate yourself on the subject and not know about her

1142
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:16,383
Mud

1143
01:12:16,639 --> 01:12:18,175
Is the only other person who is charged

1144
01:12:18,431 --> 01:12:21,503
And if you know about what happened after the assassination

1145
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:22,527
You know that boot

1146
01:12:22,783 --> 01:12:23,807
Sled with Harold

1147
01:12:24,063 --> 01:12:25,087
So you know that like

1148
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:28,159
There's another person who was with him

1149
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:32,511
How to just f****** stupid

1150
01:12:32,767 --> 01:12:34,559
When you see things like that that

1151
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:35,839
To borrow from

1152
01:12:36,095 --> 01:12:37,887
A philosopher named Alex Jones

1153
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:42,751
Is that the Rosetta Stone

1154
01:12:43,263 --> 01:12:44,287
Make stuff out you got it

1155
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:45,055
Confident

1156
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:47,871
Exactly

1157
01:12:48,127 --> 01:12:49,151
The terrifying yeah it is

1158
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:50,687
So we'll be back

1159
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:57,087
Website

1160
01:12:57,343 --> 01:13:03,487
We are on Twitter

1161
01:13:03,743 --> 01:13:09,887
Could please find a local charity or anything that you can do

1162
01:13:10,143 --> 01:13:12,191
Do to help in the areas that you are

1163
01:13:12,447 --> 01:13:17,055
Indeed

1164
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:19,615
Turd blossom

1165
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:21,919
Holding

1166
01:13:24,223 --> 01:13:24,991
Alex

1167
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:25,759
In color

1168
