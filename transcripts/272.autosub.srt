00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:07,680
Alexandra Thurston color

2
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:11,776
Everybody

3
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:18,176
Jordan

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,040
Got any hot sauce

5
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:30,976
People I believe that I've found by hot sauce pepper

6
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:38,400
I could be wrong about this selection of hot sauces

7
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:39,424
From

8
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:46,848
Beginnings

9
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:53,248
Can see the Hydra Hail Hydra

10
00:00:57,088 --> 00:01:00,672
Marvel Universe

11
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,720
I believe the other song

12
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:04,768
I thought was a scorpion

13
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:05,536
Pepper

14
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:07,840
Trinidad scorpion sauce

15
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:09,120
And it was great

16
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:14,752
Just the right level of heat a little bit scary really easy

17
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:16,288
Not easy but enjoyable

18
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:18,848
Rideout okay

19
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,384
There's a fruitiness to it

20
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,200
So I believe once I move into apartment

21
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:25,248
Start my pepper Garden the first

22
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:29,600
Things

23
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:30,368
Stream

24
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:31,136
Scorpion

25
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:38,304
About it

26
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,608
Peppers

27
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:42,144
Like very gentle

28
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:44,448
It's always got to be something aggressive

29
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:46,240
7 poisonous

30
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:48,544
Venomous

31
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,312
You know

32
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:54,944
For the fruit

33
00:01:56,224 --> 00:02:00,064
You plant know not to cuz it hurts

34
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,184
We're the only animal dumb enough to be like

35
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,720
Taste good

36
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:08,768
If you'll watch

37
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,096
Absolutely focus on

38
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:17,984
I don't know if there any that are named after cuddly animals

39
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,752
Peppers

40
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,736
And I just

41
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,808
There's a pepper that just straight-up look like a

42
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:38,464
Okay Peter Pepper

43
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,000
Existed

44
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:46,656
How did that happen

45
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:50,752
Multicolored

46
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,032
That would be great

47
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:58,432
Okay I'll work on that I'll cross-pollinate

48
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:00,480
That might be a little bit outside of my

49
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:03,040
The migraine some abilities that we will try

50
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,952
But I do know a lot about

51
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:13,024
You shall learn

52
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,656
12

53
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:21,728
Continue are looking into what Alex

54
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:24,544
Sandy Hook and how his

55
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,312
Reporting

56
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:27,104
Has taken

57
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,640
Has been molded

58
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,456
A shout out to

59
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,224

ARG

65
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:04,224
I liked

66
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:07,296
Nick

67
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,928
Are you sure it's not night it could be Nike

68
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:19,327
You could be mispronouncing all of these literally Quran. I believe that

69
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:24,191
Jambo I might be way off

70
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:26,751
I apologize

71
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:31,103

00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:34,687
Appreciated

73
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:42,879
Don't get mad until your brilliant someone sodomite sent me a bucket of poop

00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:52,351
Appreciate

75
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:54,911
Keith

76
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,191
You're now technically

77
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:04,383
Don't get mad and tell your brother someone sodomites a bucket of poop

78
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,879
I don't want

79
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,671
Jesus Christ

80
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:32,799
We appreciate please do about a month behind

81
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:33,823
Shoutouts

82
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:36,383
Just because there are a lot of people out there were very generous

83
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,967
And I'm sorry

84
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:42,271
I don't want to do a half-hour of

85
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,807
Policy wonk

86
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:50,207
And I don't want people with one sound effect absolutely

87
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:56,607
Individual mamao that we can do it at episode while still giving everybody their place

88
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:07,871
A little bit of a delay but

89
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:13,759
December 20th

90
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:17,087
2012 21st

91
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,879
Right

92
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:22,719
The world

93
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:33,983
It's mostly Alex David Icke about how the world isn't ending

94
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,519
Reptilian overlords

95
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:40,127
Very convoluted

96
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:42,943
Was that day about the by apocalypse

97
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:45,247
So he doesn't talk too much about Sandy

98
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,039
But there were couple clips

99
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:49,087
That were from that episode

100
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:51,135
That I pulled just as a reminder

101
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,159
So we don't

102
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:55,743
Skip entirely over

103
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:58,047
Crisis actors who predict

104
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:03,679
Did the end of the world or maybe they were

105
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,447
You're going to that from

106
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:14,687
In this first clip we find out where Alex's editorial position

107
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,967
Is here on the

108
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:17,247
The beginning of December

109
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:22,623
System being a winner

110
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:42,335
Just like

111
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:48,991
Meriden

112
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,551
Peter denied Jesus

113
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:54,367
I'm not sure exactly

114
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:57,439
Gotcha we have Alex

115
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,719
Coming out very

116
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,999
Clearly early on that

117
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:02,303
Official story

118
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:04,863
A story is affable so

119
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:07,423
You know you don't like to hear this the day after

120
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,727
Where we last left

121
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:10,751
Starting to

122
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:11,519
Suggest

123
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,055
That the father

124
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,079
Who was interviewed

125
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,919
Is Greek people needed to investigate

126
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:20,735
On the 20th

127
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:21,503
Maybe like the stories

128
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,271
Affable

129
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,295
Easter bunny tail

130
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,319
It's not good

131
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:26,111
I'm not excited about that

132
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:28,671
But he does spend most of the time at the beginning

133
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,719
The show just talk about the establishment

134
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:36,095
Symptoms you got to watch out for Global

135
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:42,495
Hard as he has been already

136
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,775
To just gone defense

137
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:44,543
Gone defense

138
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:49,663
I'm going

139
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:54,527
Ways that Alex portended his own descent into stupidity

140
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:59,391
He did say that the way that you win is by deceiving and the only way that they

141
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,159
You can do that

142
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:05,791
Is if you are willfully willfully ignorant so it does kind of suggest about him

143
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,423
You give you gets pretty

144
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,775
Call

145
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,055
Which I'm not sure why you

146
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,591
Needed that it's kind of fun,

147
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:21,663
For him to actually want to and fulfill his

148
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,687
Promise

149
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:23,711
To get to call

150
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:26,783
Call

151
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:29,087
This caller is talking about how bad

152
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:29,855
In the day please

153
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:30,879
Used to act

154
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:36,511
Currently to make

155
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:38,815
Because I kind of relates to

156
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:39,583
To Alex's

157
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,351
Is that

158
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:41,375
You'll see

159
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:47,775
When I would be walking down the street in my own neighborhood I would often be stopped as a as a Young Man

160
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:56,223
Evolve now

161
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,503
2

162
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:03,903
Serious urges actually seizing people and things like that

163
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:25,663
So just colors describing something from his childhood he doesn't sound like a young man

164
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:28,223
Pretending

165
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,575
He's trying to do that to suggest

166
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,855
The globalist

167
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:34,623
To bring in Marshall

168
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,439
Feasible

169
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:41,535
New York

170
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,327
The coming martial law

171
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:46,911
But as he does so frequently what he's doing is presenting a warped version

172
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:47,679
Reality

173
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:48,447
Completely erase

174
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,215
Contacts

175
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:50,239
From the conversation

176
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:53,823
In this case what I was talking about is the stop-and-frisk policy

177
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,871
Operated under

178
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:59,967
Particularly troubling except from the early 2000s

179
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:07,135
The policy was an outgrowth of the broken window

180
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:07,903
Dishes

181
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,695
In which larger more serious crimes

182
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:10,463
Naturally spray

183
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:17,631
Following that logic the police prioritize stop in Petty crimes like public urination public transit fare evasion in the like

184
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:21,727
Environment where more serious crime

185
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:24,031
Didn't go great

186
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:26,079
That's the public

187
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:29,407
In reality it was just a way to Shakedown and terrorized my

188
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:33,247
In 2010 a police officer named Adrian Schoolcraft

189
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,783
Recorded tapes

190
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:35,807
Police roll call meeting

191
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,087
First District

192
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,623
Of the bedford-stuyvesant

193
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,903
Area

194
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,183
They clearly show the

195
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:43,743
The commanding officers explicitly telling their officers

196
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,535
Trouble

197
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,607
Reports filed

198
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:52,703
Schoolcraft was detained for sweet held in a mental hospital for 6 days

199
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,471
Retaliation

200
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,519
Ultimately

201
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,311
To pay $7,000 for his own

202
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:00,383
Speak in 2011

203
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,223
680 5724 people were stopped

204
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:04,991
Come Frist

205
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,551
Of these people 80%

206
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,575
Completely innocent of

207
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,879
A number that is super consist

208
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:13,439
Yearly data analyzed by the New York civil liberties

209
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:14,975
And here's

210
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:17,023
Between 2000 to 2013

211
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:18,815
In full effect

212
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,887
Stop was never lower than

213
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:26,495
Interesting Lee in all those years you want to look at them at any of them

214
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:30,591
Frisked who happened to be white was never hired

215
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:31,359
12%

216
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:34,687
Which is considering that New York City is approximately

217
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:41,087
At least 44%

218
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,135
5% of the people stopped

219
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:46,719
In 2080 5% 2080

220
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,743
7% with this

221
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,279
2011

222
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,583
Without socks

223
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,143
Please Shake people down in New York and doesn't bring

224
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:54,911
The conversation

225
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,447
He's lying by omission

226
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,751
He's doing such expressive white supremacist

227
00:12:59,007 --> 00:12:59,519
Disposition

228
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:05,919
He's totally New York

229
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:09,247
The stop-and-frisk was specifically

230
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:11,807
Used as a weapon against minority communities is

231
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:14,111
The definition of be right for the wrong reasons

232
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:15,647
Tim Roth

233
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:20,255
Yeah but it still boils

234
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,279
Complaint which is

235
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:23,583
The underlying complaint is

236
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:29,215
Like that's really what they're bitching about

237
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,239
Essentially

238
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,287
I thought about that

239
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:35,103
I really did because I thought about how that could

240
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:35,871
Fit into

241
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:36,895
Anime

242
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:37,919
Cephalic

243
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:41,247
Yeah but if those things

244
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:46,367
You talk about other targeting minority communities

245
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:48,671
Because that would help make that

246
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:50,975
He just wants that

247
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:54,303
Piece of it completely left cuz it opens a door his

248
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,071
He sort of argument

249
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:56,863
Which is

250
00:13:57,119 --> 00:14:00,447
Dhp

251
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:02,495
Horizon Destroyer

252
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,639
Right stuff like that

253
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:10,687
Right and your quotas being failed

254
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:21,695
That's crazy make money

255
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:23,487
Jordan make money

256
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:27,839
They destroyed the reputation of policing in America

257
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:33,471
Good workout about

258
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,615
The picture of police being out of line

259
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:46,271
It's an important distinction that needs to come up every now and again on this show that just because he's

260
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:49,343
About something

261
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,623
You could be entirely wrong

262
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,207
You said he's taking these collars

263
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,999
And

264
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,023
Get the call and wants

265
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,839
And this guy has

266
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:00,863
An interesting piece

267
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,911
Of the story that he wants to report

268
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,703
And Alex allows

269
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:05,727
Do so which

270
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:13,151
Sandy the supposed Sandy Hook shooter Adam Lanza was found only two handguns not a Bushmaster assault

271
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:17,759
Rifle

272
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:28,255
What does rate

273
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:34,655
There's an article

274
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,311
As part of a promotion

275
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:04,351
New York

276
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,543
Absolutely Alex

277
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:17,663
It's all right out there on the opening up enough publicity and enough of it can be

278
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:24,063
Giving out to the public, maybe I can turn things for awhile

279
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:35,071
That is super easily is that a win we've talked about this before and I apologize

280
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,863
Name or his job but one of the

281
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,935
Go to work in likes that design and graphic

282
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:40,959
At work on

283
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:41,727
The Dark Knight

284
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:42,495
Is from

285
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:47,615
Kansas City on a map

286
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:54,783
As I remember from the last time I looked into

287
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,063
It's very very

288
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,855
And all the other stuff is

289
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:59,903
Misreporting the idea that they sent out

290
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,951
BeIN sent orders to attack

291
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:07,071
He did say that they control of their City

292
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:11,935
What look that's the least important thing I think I want to talk about

293
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:13,471
Dark Knight Rises

294
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:14,495
Dark Knight Rises

295
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,263
Apology

296
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:18,847
I'm getting my Tim Burton's All In

297
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:24,991
It's for

298
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:28,575
Exactly all getting mixed up

299
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:34,207
Okay I think

300
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:34,975
Is really just

301
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:36,767
It's very stupid

302
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:39,071
And it's just indicative of how

303
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,607
He's trying to bring in as much

304
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,679
Narrative

305
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,471
And that's just heard of it

306
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,519
The muddy the water

307
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,567
Seymour

308
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,383
With hearsay and bulshit

309
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:58,527
Do you know what's even crazier send out physical maps

310
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,807
Actually sent out

311
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:00,575
The single

312
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,111
From the Yeah Yeah Yeahs

313
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,135
Maps

314
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,927
Do you know when that came out

315
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,719
911

316
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:10,047
Don't know

317
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:14,399
Play that on Rock Band 2

318
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:18,239
More important I want to talk about is that this call is repeating

319
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:19,263
Incomplete

320
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,799
Information that he picked up somewhere

321
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:23,359
And Alex is doubling down on its a great disbelief

322
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,639
His listeners about what happened

323
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,735
You're talking about

324
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:31,295
Adam Lanza

325
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:36,159
They didn't even have a

326
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,463
If you read the police report on the shooting at

327
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:42,815
All the shooters person with loaded semi-automatic Sig Sauer p

328
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:45,375
269 mm pistol

329
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,399
Additional

330
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:51,775
Located near the shooter was partially loaded Glock 20 10 mm semi-automatic

331
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:53,055
It appeared to be jam

332
00:18:56,639 --> 00:19:01,503
However the next line explains that quotes a Bushmaster Master model XM

333
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,319
6 rifles located

334
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,087
Away from the shooter

335
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:06,879
The rifle shoulder strap

336
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:08,415
Was attached to the front but disconnect

337
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:09,183
Get to the part of the

338
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:11,743
The disconnected rear portion was the result of a

339
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:12,511
Field nut

340
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:15,071
It's unknown if the nuts failed when the rifle

341
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,375
Or as the result of being dropped

342
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,143
Referring to the floor

343
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:23,263
So using that weapon is evidenced by all sorts of other friends again

344
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,359
Possibly because the strap

345
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:28,639
It's unclear

346
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:29,663
Exactly why

347
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,967
There's also people who suggested that added Jam

348
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,759
That's not entirely

349
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:35,807
They were able to

350
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:36,575
Do I

351
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,599
The people who are investigate

352
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:38,623
Able to fire

353
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:41,439
Yeah it doesn't appear that it was critical

354
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:45,279
But for one reason or another you ended up throwing

355
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,559
And favoring

356
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:52,191
It could just be a crazy thing in the moment of like I'm sick of all of this

357
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,727
Mass killing I wanted

358
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:54,495
Seether

359
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:03,967
Four wife that gun

360
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:06,271
Was found a little further away from him

361
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,295
Then the two

362
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:08,575
This guy is pretending

363
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:09,343
But there wasn't

364
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:14,719
Bushmaster rifle there at

365
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:19,583
Lanza also had a ton of ammo on him

366
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:22,143
A person including one shotgun shell

367
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,423
Even though you didn't have a shock

368
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:27,775
There are other shotgun shells found around

369
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:29,567
It dropped but it still raises the question

370
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,103
Why the ammo

371
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:31,871
Was there a

372
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:32,895
I have a shotgun

373
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:36,223
If you just read a little bit further in the police report quote

374
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:39,551
Recovered from the car wasn't its match the 12

375
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:40,831
12-gauge shotgun

376
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:43,647
24 rounds of ammunition

377
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:45,695
That would make sense then

378
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:48,511
He just left the shop.

379
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:54,655
Couldn't carry it I don't know

380
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:56,703
And that was there for when you get back

381
00:20:56,959 --> 00:21:02,591
To the car yeah it is possible never know exactly the answer

382
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:03,359
He's dead

383
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:04,895
Yeah

384
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,199
Completely different rifle

385
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:10,783
Kill his mother but that gun was found

386
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:16,159
Organs found in her house

387
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,440
That she loves

388
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,208
Channellock

389
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,328
Too many guns

390
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:25,632
I'm not comfortable making a hard.

391
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:32,032
Determination on what is

392
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:33,312
It's a lot of gun

393
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:37,152
Bad idea that this caller is suggesting

394
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:39,456
Alex is irresponsible

395
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,528
Explain

396
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,088
You part of what's being

397
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:45,856
You presented as

398
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:49,184
This story is a fairy tale

399
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:53,536
Right that's

400
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:54,560
It allows for

401
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:55,840
The muddying of the waters

402
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:56,864
It's b*******

403
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,144
It's how Alex build

404
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:00,704
Real-time

405
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:02,496
Some of this is a collars

406
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:09,408
Perhaps

407
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:16,832
Or has difficulty taking a lot of calls

408
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:18,368
There's a part of me that wonders if

409
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,904
As if there could be some sort of like

410
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,440
Where are they now VH

411
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:23,488
Who call in

412
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:27,584
Like is this guy still denying Sandy Hook

413
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,144
Like I want to know more about this idiot

414
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:30,912
And what it is

415
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:31,936
He's doing with his life

416
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:32,704
Yeah

417
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:35,520
I bet he is

418
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:43,200
There's not a like

419
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:43,968
Agree

420
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,272
Percentage of

421
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,320
To buy intalex

422
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,136
People probably can

423
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,160
Figure things out

424
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,208
It's not

425
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,744
Hey but I bet it's not

426
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:59,328
I would say it's like a

427
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:01,120
A large percentage

428
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:04,192
Percentage lease

429
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:06,752
Every year whatever and they're just like

430
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:07,776
I'm done with the

431
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:12,128
A certain percentage go even further in become white nationalist

432
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:12,896
Malicious

433
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:14,688
And then everybody else just kind of

434
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,968
Staying in the

435
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:19,552
The fluctuating middle in the dryer cycle

436
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:20,576
That's possible

437
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:23,392
I don't know

438
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,816
Speculation with no information whatsoever

439
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:33,888
For sure

440
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:36,960
So if Alex gets back to the

441
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:43,616
Or something

442
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:44,640
What is wild

443
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:56,416
Is the school district in Michigan

444
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:59,232
Week left of classes

445
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:01,280
Because there were fears of school shooting

446
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:03,840
Because there were rumors being spread that there was going to

447
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:07,680
Apocalypse

448
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:10,240
These kids are too distracted

449
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:16,640
We're just going on break early.

450
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:19,200
Afraid that there's going to be a mass shooting there were threats

451
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:22,272
And everybody is wild

452
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,136
Because the article that I read about afraid

453
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:28,672
School shooting because

454
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:30,208
The they looked into

455
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,232
These rumors

456
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,512
Nothing

457
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:35,072
The reason

458
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,400
Being ineffective

459
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:41,984
The kids are too distracted occupied with

460
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,032
These ideas

461
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,056
You know just because

462
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:46,080
You find a rumors

463
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,640
The kids aren't going to emotion

464
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:49,664
Beetle

465
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,200
The fear of the anxiety

466
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:53,504
Spreads like wildfire

467
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,272
Cervical disc

468
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:56,832
Was like you guys are going on holiday break anyway

469
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,280
Is the same as closing

470
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:06,816
End of the world

471
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:09,120
Terry

472
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:16,800
I don't want to die okay cool we're going to go on break a little bit

473
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:18,592
So

474
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:19,872
In this next clip Alex

475
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:23,968
Get really defensive that everybody

476
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,672
This morning

477
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:45,216
4 years

478
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:50,080
Hair

479
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:59,296
I think a lot of people don't know

480
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:00,064
Your position

481
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:04,928
I think that's the issue I don't know how anyone supposed to know what you told people off air

482
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:06,208
Except

483
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:10,560
Around this time

484
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:15,424
That it's b*******

485
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:21,824
Totally reasonable I wonder if

486
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:30,528
You present one time where I kind of want the world

487
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:34,112
Retroactively retroactively to have ended in 2012

488
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:41,280
Just for him to be wrong it's not the one.

489
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,120
Still get to watch him

490
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:46,144
Burning flames

491
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:50,496
I guess fortunately it didn't go that way

492
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:51,776
If we would have

493
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:55,872
I saw that

494
00:26:58,944 --> 00:26:59,968
How to keep steak

495
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:01,760
It's super Bazaar

496
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:02,784
Because like

497
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,320
Generally speaking

498
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:05,600
But I listen to these episode

499
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:13,024
For about an hour call

500
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:16,096
I might be like next time

501
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:18,144
Multiple calls

502
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:18,912
What is

503
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:21,472
You know fairly early in the show

504
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:22,752
I was bizarre

505
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:24,288
When you get this call from some

506
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,312
Suggest

507
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,176
Glad

508
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:41,696
Morgan

509
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:46,560
Call station

510
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:47,584
Stance

511
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,632
And I was hoping you'd heard of her

512
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:51,936
She should be good to have on your show

513
00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:01,664
So I love the idea that

514
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:14,720
I sure do but if you would spell regretted his voice

515
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:17,024
It's not regret its frustration with his phone system

516
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:17,792
Like its

517
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:19,072
His collars

518
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:21,120
Because they often don't know that

519
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:25,472
He's gone to them

520
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:27,264
If you listen to it as much as I do

521
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,848
That frustration is there

522
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:38,272
That little conversation with somebody can you hear me can you hear me

523
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:41,344
Alex Heights

524
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:43,136
3 seconds

525
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:50,816
The owner of the gun case indoor shooting range in Hot Springs Arkansas

526
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:53,120
Does an official instructor license

527
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:54,144
The NRA

528
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:57,216
Interesting Lee it

529
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:58,240
Plastic fitting

530
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,592
See you guys in 2014 sheep and all Muslims from her shooting range

531
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:08,992
Okay thanks more than enough loss of life on my home soil at the hands of Muslim

532
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,296
To substantiate my position

533
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:13,856
Can and will follow the directors and their Quran

534
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:15,648
And kill here at home

535
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:17,952
He's a narc

536
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,000
All places

537
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:22,304
Never in my wildest

538
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:28,448
The First Amendment did not include protections for Muslims and defended her action play sound right

539
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:35,616
Interpreted as being very scary

540
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:37,920
Two Muslims walked

541
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:43,552
Dubai rains last week with allah-o-akbar ringtones and message alert tone brother smartphones

542
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:48,416
Facebook little English have proof of US citizenship

543
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:50,976
Shoot gun

544
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:53,536
They were constantly glancing towards

545
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,560
The cameras in the rain

546
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:58,144
Looking at each other in speaking in their own language

547
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,936
She went on to say that

548
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,472
Nothing here

549
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:07,872
I've no way of discerning which Muslims will or will not kill in the name of their religion in the commands there

550
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:10,176
I choose to err on the side of

551
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:10,944
Caution

552
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:11,968
Unfortunately

553
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:15,552
To be flipped around Subaru

554
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:28,352
Members of violent white nationalist groups of the government are on the mall white man it's almost like she's

555
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:30,144
Not advocating for that

556
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,960
Necessarily

557
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:33,984
To what she's putting for

558
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:35,008
She's very Stu

559
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:37,568
Yeah this is how this s*** always goes

560
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:40,128
It's the same thing we talked about in terms of Ted Nugent

561
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:40,896
Gonzaga score

562
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:44,736
These people pretend to have a principled absolute moral stand.

563
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:46,272
The right to own a gun

564
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:48,576
Is the most important part of being free

565
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,624
Restrict anyone's access

566
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,648
Misticanza

567
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:52,672
All guns

568
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:53,696
Entomology

569
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:57,792
As soon as they feel threatened

570
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:59,328
Electrolyzer

571
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,608
Restricting the very right

572
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:02,400
Yeah to believe is sex

573
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:04,704
These people are all liars

574
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,496
Well if she staying

575
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:08,288
The First Amendment doesn't cover

576
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:09,312
Muslims

577
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:10,336
Yeah fine

578
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:13,920
If that's if that's you're saying then get the f*** out we don't need you

579
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,712
Everett

580
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:19,040
She's also saying that the Second Amendment doesn't

581
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:21,344
Because they're not allowed in

582
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:22,368
Gun store

583
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:24,928
So they aren't legally allowed to

584
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:26,720
Carry guns

585
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:30,048
She's essentially saying that Muslims

586
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:39,776
Morgan ran for the governorship of Arkansas in their 2018 election

587
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:45,152
Set up any legal raffle

588
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:50,016
$50 to her campaign with her signature engraved on it

589
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:56,672
When legal question started popping up she refunded everyone's money but it Bears mentioned because he thought that was a good idea

590
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,512
Running in just a Republican

591
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:01,280
Primary

592
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:04,096
Disposition

593
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:05,120
Was pretty on point

594
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:07,936
She brought it was $200,000

595
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:11,776
Much of which came from political

596
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:12,800
Play Sharon address

597
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:15,872
Call Business Services Arkansas

598
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:17,152
Commerce and action

599
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:19,200
The maximum amount allowed to her

600
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:20,992
But also

601
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:22,016
People

602
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:23,808
A group called conduit for action

603
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:29,696
Convert fraction as a hard right political action committee

604
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:32,000
Which is super against Governor Hutchinson

605
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:33,536
Person that you would be running

606
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:36,608
Because though he's a Republican

607
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:38,912
He's not as Hardline as they want their governor to

608
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:42,240
They publish articles on their website like this one from

609
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:43,008
Just about a week ago

610
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,080
Governor's tax plan to Fort Constitution

611
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:47,104
About Hutchinson

612
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:47,872
Proposed increase

613
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:52,480
That sounds like something that the founding fathers were real

614
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:57,600
During the election Republic multiple articles promoting Morgan's campaign

615
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:58,368
Disclose

616
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:00,416
Clone political action

617
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:05,024
We just shady as hell but not illegal in Arkansas

618
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,328
It is a problem

619
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,608
On the other hand

620
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:13,216
Alex would have loved her if she owned a pool supply store in Austin

621
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:16,032
Said he never would have had the same young girls

622
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:21,152
I understand all the information I was able to find most of these are clones

623
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:22,176
PA

624
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:23,712
From conduit

625
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,832
It really has to be

626
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:33,440
No okay there we go

627
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:37,792
Alright I know there's been some discussion about it

628
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:41,376
Because it is a really f****** weird to allow

629
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:44,704
Maximum don't matter

630
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:48,800
Republican primary

631
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:55,200
Which is super f***** up as the Arkansas times pointed out during the campaign

632
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:56,480
Power was about winning the vote

633
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:59,296
Call Morgan

634
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:01,344
Republican primary for governor bike

635
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,624
Compiling the most votes

636
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,952
But she's already won the race by driving Governor Hutchinson

637
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:07,488
Declaration

638
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:08,512
Open position to

639
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:09,792
The farthest right reaches

640
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:10,816
The political Spectrum

641
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:13,120
By being in the race you required Hutchins

642
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:15,424
Come out from the shadows and Pandora

643
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:19,520
The further right parts of being in the race

644
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:21,568
Dante's rhetoric towards the LGB

645
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,616
Community in about women's rights

646
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:25,664
Became far more toxic than it had been in

647
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:26,688
The campaign cycle

648
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:28,224
And this Jordan

649
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,552
Is how the Overton window shift

650
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:33,344
She's a perfect

651
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,112
Example of

652
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:35,136
Yeah

653
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:36,672
Jesus

654
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:37,440
Dick

655
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,464
Sheetz

656
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:48,704
I don't know if she doesn't come on eventually

657
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,800
Political action committees necessarily even wanted

658
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,872
Effect right

659
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:57,152
Woodforest Hutchinson

660
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:58,176
To change some of the

661
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:58,944
The position store

662
00:34:59,200 --> 00:34:59,712
The harder right

663
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:04,576
Funneling money

664
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:07,136
In order to push him to the right

665
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:10,976
That's how this works

666
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:16,096
Yeah there's no way they would actually want her to win because obviously it's her first day in office

667
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:20,448
It would be like the Constitution

668
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:22,240
What would be what are you doing

669
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,032
Yeah

670
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:27,104
She would not have a very successful term as Governor

671
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:29,664
I thinks you might get herself into

672
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:30,688
Bit of trouble

673
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:32,992
Even hard right folk or not

674
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:36,832
So

675
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:38,880
Alex just ordered Treads water for

676
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:42,464
He has a guy

677
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:45,024
My friend

678
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:49,632
I don't know

679
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:51,424
Derek Fisher

680
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,216
Formerly of the lake

681
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:55,264
Not Barrack

682
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:01,152
Me and my dad went to the Lakers

683
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:02,176
Preseason game

684
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:04,480
Years and years back

685
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:06,784
Is he a good guy

686
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:10,880
I don't remember I don't think anyone is mean to me

687
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:12,672
A check wasn't even

688
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:17,536
No I was there we got in early cuz it's not

689
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:18,560
Through like a back door

690
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:19,328
Forget autograph

691
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:21,376
Yeah yeah

692
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:22,912
Sounds like Kobe Bryant

693
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:24,960
It was there I got his autograph and

694
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:26,752
Eddie Jones

695
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,800
Yeah

696
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:30,080
Derek Fisher walked out

697
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:45,440
I think it was Sean Rooks walked up

698
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:51,840
Midland power forward

699
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:53,376
I did not I wasn't interested in

700
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:57,216
So that I'm getting these autographed news people I look over and check

701
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:57,984
Free throw

702
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,520
He's warming up shoot

703
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:04,640
Horrific Lee every time

704
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:06,944
I never imagined

705
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:11,552
Just a little boy

706
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:14,368
On a basketball court

707
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,648
Jessie Shack

708
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:18,208
His bodyguard

709
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:19,488
He's like no

710
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:22,560
It gives me up

711
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:36,640
Littlefield

712
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:40,736
I mean obviously I pay his salary and everything

713
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:42,016
He's the boss babe

714
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:44,320
What you going to do

715
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:46,112
Point is Derek Fisher

716
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:55,584
I think of other people who are on the Lakers around that time

717
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:59,936
Andrew Bogut is a big pizza Gator so he could have been

718
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:04,544
It's true. It's not it's about

719
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:12,736
Bar

720
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:15,296
But he's a good guy

721
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:22,976
Interview because he is

722
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:37,056
Liberty

723
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:40,640
Bob Marley

724
00:38:54,464 --> 00:39:00,608
He's been a longtime member of the NRA board so Alex being like they've gotten more extreme underhand makes literally no sense

725
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:06,240
He was a member of the board's almost the entire time Alex has been mad at them and calling

726
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:09,312
Control 12

727
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:11,104
Wow you sitting down with Baba

728
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:17,248
It's just meaningless if they have gotten more but it has nothing

729
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:18,016
Things to do with

730
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:19,296
Anything that

731
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:20,320
You know he's just been there

732
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:28,256
Being a bit of a right-wing

733
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:31,328
Years from 1995 to

734
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:33,120
2003

735
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:35,168
For bills who sponsored became

736
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,008
What was that name of the post office another one was about the number of night

737
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:40,288
296 Atlanta

738
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,568
Commemorative coin should be

739
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:45,664
Another was about how Alabama Florida and Georgia

740
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,944
Share surface water rights

741
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,224
To the Chattahoochee River

742
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:52,576
The 4th

743
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,368
Bojack

744
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:56,160
Wichita

745
00:39:56,416 --> 00:40:02,560
Play one woman by the federal government from requiring States

746
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:06,144
Spouses

747
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:07,168
People inside

748
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,472
Alright

749
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:13,824
Wow he's a piece of s***

750
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:18,176
Unrecognized whatever States

751
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:19,456
Thanks Bill

752
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:23,040
I have to concede that a lot of Congress members on both sides of the aisle have

753
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:23,808
Levels

754
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:26,112
There's this horrible in terms of productivity

755
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:30,976
Majapahit

756
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:32,512
For that

757
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:33,792
I don't think it speaks

758
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:35,072
Super highly

759
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:37,120
4/5

760
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:40,448
Is fat and all you Come Away With Me

761
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:41,216
Some coins

762
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:43,776
The name post office in a bill that deeply undermines

763
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:44,544
The group

764
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,592
Right I don't think that's great

765
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:47,616
You know

766
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:49,664
I mean

767
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,480
The argument against that

768
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:56,832
When you really get down based on

769
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,392
Democrat

770
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:00,672
And how garbage they are

771
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,256
Is not going to have like

772
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:09,632
She probably won't even have four bills passed in the next 8 years

773
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:16,032
Because they're so shity but she's already done far more than any of the other Hunters

774
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:20,384
Call myself out for that

775
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:24,480
Don't really on the surface get a whole lot done

776
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:26,272
I'm saying she's got for bills

777
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,040
Years

778
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:27,808
And

779
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:29,600
I do want better for activity

780
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:33,952
Time I recognize that it's an endemic system

781
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:39,840
It's beside the point

782
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:40,864
More to the point

783
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:46,496
Perhaps more relevant to our conversation in office 48000 5

784
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:48,032
Hundred dollars from Lockheed Martin

785
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:49,568
42600

786
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:50,336
$3

787
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:54,687
The NRA 39500 $50 from clock

788
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:55,711
Representing

789
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:57,247
Three of his five large

790
00:41:57,503 --> 00:41:58,015
Campaign

791
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:59,039
Contributors recent Tire

792
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:01,599
In addition to that is political action

793
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:04,927
100 1970

794
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:05,695
$3

795
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:06,975
From gun-rights group

796
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:10,559
Also be a board of

797
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:12,863
Member of the National Rifle Association

798
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:14,143
He's not someone who's

799
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:16,447
Even close to being unbiased on the subs

800
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:17,215
Jacob Gunn

801
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:18,751
As just another example of Alex

802
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:20,287
Pakman show with shells

803
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:22,335
For the gun Lobby's come-out is fasted

804
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:23,103
Aggressive

805
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:24,127
Possible

806
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:25,919
Against the very idea of reggae

807
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:27,199
Latorre reform as it were

808
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:28,991
NES

809
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:30,783
He's just

810
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:33,087
Complete friend everybody's a gun show

811
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:35,391
Yeah nobody else

812
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:40,511
Except

813
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:41,279
Other than

814
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:44,607
Ventura that you could call not a

815
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,399
She'll for gun entry

816
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:48,191
It's crazy

817
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:51,007
It's not a 100%

818
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:55,103
Agreement among the system is what it is

819
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:59,199
Of course you can buy politicians because you already have a s*** ton of money

820
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:00,991
You've already bought enough politician

821
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:03,551
For them to make it okay for you to buy

822
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:07,391
Politicians

823
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:08,415
Supreme Court Justices

824
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:10,719
We'll make it okay for you to buy politic

825
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:12,511
America

826
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:15,327
Can people is old don't have a 100%

827
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:19,167
Ratings on everybody should be allowed to buy

828
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:21,983
Like if you pulled a Merica they would be like

829
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:27,871
Well 40% says it's like that doesn't make sense at all

830
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:28,639
Yeah it seems

831
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:31,711
It seems like no matter how you phrase it

832
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:32,479
Look at it

833
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:33,247
There's a better way to do

834
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:41,183
I think our politicians is a great idea

835
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:42,719
Whenever you could do

836
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:43,999
Just use a lot of money

837
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:46,047
To change the political system

838
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:48,351
To benefit

839
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:55,775
2002

840
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:59,103
She was involved

841
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:04,991
That lobbyists Bruce plan to give bar in a 38 caliber pistol

842
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:10,879
Widener says that he remove the magazine

843
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:12,671
From the gun but didn't clear the chamber

844
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:16,255
We were handling it safely

845
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:17,535
Accepted it was

846
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:20,607
Certainly inspires confidence

847
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:24,959
Especially considering that according to Bruce's LinkedIn page

848
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:30,079
The conditioned air Association of Georgia that has extra weird

849
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:32,383
Subway

850
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:34,175
Almost shot

851
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:36,991
The reception because I'm disappointed

852
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:41,343
Disappointed you're looking at the wrong issue

853
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:49,023
It's true it's not that like the bullet missed

854
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:53,119
It's him it's also could have hit anybody else

855
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:55,167
No I get it

856
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:56,703
People who

857
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:58,239
I know I know

858
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:00,543
Fatbardha initiate

859
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:04,639
So it's not so embarrassing

860
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:06,175
Then he was the one receiving the

861
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:08,735
Figure is giving an ant

862
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:10,271
Keep going to a guy who's

863
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:12,831
Is a board member of the NRA gun guy

864
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:14,623
You should do your due diligence

865
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:16,671
Make sure there's not a

866
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:23,327
Real embarrassing things about a podcast

867
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:25,119
Undermine a lot of these arguments

868
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:27,679
But that's that's

869
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:29,215
Talk about

870
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:33,823
Whenever I whenever it's like

871
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:34,847
10 guns or whatever

872
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:36,639
It is not

873
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:37,407
That you

874
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:39,455
Can't have all those guns

875
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:40,223
And it's that

876
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:41,247
Every gun

877
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:44,063
Multiplies the ability for YouTube

878
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:45,599
F****** minorly

879
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:56,863
Just increases the percentage of chance that something is going to

880
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:59,423
To f****** guns you handle

881
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:03,263
The more likely it just as a statistical you know

882
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:06,079
Datapoint

883
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:10,175
Like I believe people should be able to have guns

884
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:11,711
Responsibly

885
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:14,527
And all that stuff

886
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:16,319
But what we're talking about

887
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:18,111
Even two possibilities

888
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:19,903
People who handle guns

889
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:22,719
Responsible

890
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:23,999
In FA Cup

891
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:26,815
I am

892
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:31,679
I am unable to hear Bob bar without feeling like you're leaving off the

893
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:36,031
Like I always hear Bob bar in a mic when are you going to finish the word

894
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:37,567
It's a Bob Barker

895
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:39,359
When are you going to say Bob Barker

896
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:44,223
Also Bob bar was the guy who led the charge

897
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:47,295
Who was the first person

898
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:48,063
In Congress

899
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:48,831
Call on

900
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:51,391
He's an hour

901
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:52,159
He's

902
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:55,743
Mostly about

903
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:03,935
Look like it's a real thing

904
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:04,959
Which is

905
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:05,983
I guess

906
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:12,383
It's important

907
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:13,407
As much as Alex

908
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:15,711
Are not influencing him

909
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:16,479
Except for

910
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:17,759
Like to send

911
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:21,343
From any

912
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:23,647
A source on the show

913
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:25,951
There's nobody who's coming in

914
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:26,975
Poisoning is mine

915
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:37,727
Twitter whatever

916
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:42,591
You should know

917
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:45,663
These people are nuts I don't know the. Is on the street

918
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:50,527
Alex Telles

919
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:51,807
The real issue

920
00:47:56,671 --> 00:48:02,815
First person shooter games

921
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:18,175
Soldiers wooden

922
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:20,479
Kill people that's why they invented video games

923
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:21,503
Right

924
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:29,183
I beg to differ I will actually defend

925
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:36,095
Strangely enough this is something that I did read up on a lot of stuff

926
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:37,631
Ammoland

927
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:39,167
And it is

928
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:42,239
Very very unlikely for a soldier

929
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:43,007
Do to actually

930
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:44,031
Play try and kill

931
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:48,127
Like so many of the bullets that they found have been p

932
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:52,223
People literally like intentionally trying to miss

933
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:54,271
But at the same time nobody wants

934
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:55,039
To kill anybody

935
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:57,855
So there is a very high like

936
00:48:58,111 --> 00:49:00,927
What times after the

937
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:04,255
Free throw percentage level of trying to kill people

938
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:08,863
But if you're talking about you're not talking about it

939
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:15,519
In terms of like

940
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:16,543
Amtrak

941
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:19,359
People are still on the air

942
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:22,431
People are still on the side of maybe we shouldn't kill people

943
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:24,479
They're working video games around the world war

944
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:30,111
Next

945
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:31,647
Wants to tell Bob about

946
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:33,951
It's pretty scary

947
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:35,743
Bento's on Archer

948
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:38,815
Dot-com

949
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:52,383
Chinese government

950
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:16,447
Because you bring up so many good points a lot of people don't

951
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:18,239
Google

952
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:19,263
That's not a great response to

953
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:22,847
I think you can probably guess just from

954
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:23,615
Listening to Alec

955
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:24,895
You might be sensation

956
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:28,735
Attack

957
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:33,599
A respectable former House member

958
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:35,647
Operation

959
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:42,815
I did post an op-ed titled innocent blood demands no delay for us guns

960
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:45,119
But it stopped just short of saying

961
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:45,887
Something like

962
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:47,679
Hey Obama everybody gun

963
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:55,103
You can find the article online and if you do you'll see what it really is

964
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:57,919
Mostly about how is awful and heartbreaking

965
00:50:58,431 --> 00:51:02,783
These mass shootings are in America the reason it is electoral politics

966
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:06,879
The author specifically points out that Columbine happened in an election here we

967
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:08,671
Probably a big reason why no one was

968
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:10,975
Willington

969
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:12,511
Due to possible political G

970
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:14,303
They point out that

971
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:15,327
Because Obama doesn't have

972
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:16,607
Have to face another election

973
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:17,375
Rare position

974
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:18,911
Where there isn't a concern for

975
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:20,447
Really just escaping

976
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:21,215
In fact

977
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:28,127
The up at further points out.

978
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:29,407
Years even the Democrats

979
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:30,175
Ostensibly

980
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:33,503
Like the political will

981
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:35,807
Influencing funding

982
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:36,575
Provided

983
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:37,855
Honest by the NRA

984
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:39,391
Specifically pointing out

985
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:40,671
2000

986
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:41,951
When the NRA gave three

987
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:43,487
3.2 million dollars

988
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:44,767
The candidates

989
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:47,071
98% of which

990
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:47,839
Republicans

991
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:50,911
Interesting Lee in that election the largest pickle recipe

992
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:51,679
Another money

993
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:53,983
Who's California's Democratic representative

994
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:56,031
It's real strange

995
00:51:58,591 --> 00:51:59,871
The blue dog Democrat

996
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:01,151
And after he lost his

997
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:04,223
2012 he tried to Stage a comeback by running as a Republican

998
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:07,807
2015 Switchback being Democrats running

999
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:18,047
Otherwise known as a f****** a******

1000
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:18,815
Haha

1001
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:19,839
So he was part of that

1002
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:22,655
Percent of money from the NRA

1003
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:27,775
Motor 2.0 this piece

1004
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:29,567
It is about that.

1005
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:30,335
Do anyting

1006
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:32,383
You can tell that from lines like quote

1007
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:35,711
Control the United States

1008
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:38,527
However this time the public feels somewhat tired and

1009
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:43,647
Helpless every time a tragedy appeals for gun regulation

1010
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:46,207
Disappointingly always fail

1011
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:49,023
Goddamnit there's a resignation in the tech

1012
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:51,583
Profoundly felt the tragic

1013
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:52,607
Was

1014
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:53,887
Do people who are able to

1015
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:56,703
I feel things all around the world

1016
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:59,519
Define call to action

1017
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:00,543
But it's kind of meat

1018
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:02,079
Taking in the full context

1019
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:02,847
The rest of the Arctic

1020
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:05,663
Actions speak louder than words

1021
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:06,943
If Obama wants

1022
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:08,223
To take practical measures to

1023
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:08,991
Control

1024
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:10,271
He has to make a preparation

1025
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:13,087
For a protracted war and considerable political cost

1026
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:17,183
This is to say that lipstick Services meaningful is meaningless

1027
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:19,231
And ultimately of Obama wants to make

1028
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:19,999
Make a real difference

1029
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:20,767
The gun fetish

1030
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:21,791
Country

1031
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:23,327
Are going to let him do anything

1032
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:25,375
All in all of the article is

1033
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:36,639
A really big really is what we all felt like the the next day

1034
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:41,247
Yeah that's fair I mean just anybody with empathy emotions is a lot of people

1035
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:42,527
Really where

1036
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:44,831
We're not doing anything even after this

1037
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:46,367
Then it's never going to be done

1038
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:47,391
I don't know what to do

1039
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:49,183
Other than

1040
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:49,951
Myself from

1041
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:50,975
From care

1042
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:54,047
Well I guess this

1043
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:56,351
This is just business as usual so I don't have to

1044
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:57,119
Feel anymore

1045
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:58,655
It's recalled

1046
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:01,471
The New York Times wrote a piece about this article

1047
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:09,407
Nonprofits around the same time

1048
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:12,479
There was a man who

1049
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:14,783
Children

1050
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:16,831
These attacks happen no matter what weapons

1051
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:17,599
People have

1052
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:20,415
None of the children in China died

1053
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:21,183
So

1054
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:24,767
Cuz even if someone comes in with a knife

1055
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:26,303
Estep 22 kids

1056
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:28,351
The f****** terrifying awful thing

1057
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:35,007
At the very least a little

1058
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:38,079
Further line by thing

1059
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:39,359
You just broke the story

1060
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:43,199
Paul Joseph Watson posted in the op-ed on it

1061
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:44,735
Icom on December 20th

1062
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:46,015
The day of this episode

1063
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:50,111
Breitbart.com

1064
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:51,903
So Alex

1065
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:53,439
Their propaganda

1066
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:54,207
Pretending

1067
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:55,231
The first one on the scene

1068
00:54:55,743 --> 00:54:57,279
And pjw

1069
00:54:57,535 --> 00:54:59,839
Even a paragraph citing the Breitbart story and blanket

1070
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:06,239
Of course cover the Breitbart article

1071
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:07,007
News

1072
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:08,543
Interesting L one store

1073
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:10,335
What does give Alex credit for breaking

1074
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:11,103
The story

1075
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:13,919
The Communist Party

1076
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:15,711
Communist Party of China

1077
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:16,991
Is that the US should disarm

1078
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:18,527
According to Chinese

1079
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:21,087
The recent school massacre gave all

1080
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:25,951
Gave all to understand that one should not wait any longer

1081
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:29,023
The country's leaders believe that the brutality

1082
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:31,583
Connecticut

1083
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:32,863
Support for arms reduction

1084
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:34,399
Infowars.com

1085
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:37,727
That's from December 21st article Improv

1086
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:41,055
I'm not really sure what that means or even if it means

1087
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:48,991
I don't know Source on this story

1088
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:52,575
Mozart

1089
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:54,111
I'm not sure that

1090
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:58,719
I just want Alex's got this story he lets Bob go

1091
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:00,511
Get out of here Bob

1092
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:03,327
He just trusts your own

1093
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:06,655
It's a different guy

1094
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:09,727
Okay

1095
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:13,055
And that really starts

1096
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:16,639
The feel-good get them in there

1097
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:23,039
He took calls earlier in the show so we can just breathe

1098
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:23,807
They are now

1099
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:24,831
They kill everybody

1100
00:56:26,879 --> 00:56:27,903
The most brutal

1101
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:33,535
Yeah yeah

1102
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:39,423
Later on later on

1103
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:41,471
Still he did still bubbling under the sea

1104
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:44,543
And then he gets

1105
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:46,079
This

1106
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:47,359
He talks about

1107
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:49,919
Chinese newscaster

1108
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:50,687
Where is covering

1109
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:52,735
Tiananmen Square

1110
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:55,039
I think it sounds like him

1111
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:55,807
In the present

1112
00:56:57,087 --> 00:56:59,647
Square news

1113
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:01,951
Square

1114
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:19,359
Satisfaction

1115
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:27,039
Oh my God

1116
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:30,111
And it's just incredible

1117
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:35,999
But it's in chai

1118
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:48,031
I don't know I don't know I don't know if he's ever got it it's a mystery

1119
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:53,151
Very similar to him

1120
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:54,687
Taco Bell

1121
00:57:54,943 --> 00:57:59,807
Yeah

1122
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:01,599
You know I was thinking

1123
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:02,879
While he was

1124
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:04,159
While he was talking about that

1125
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:07,999
I was thinking about how that the New Yorker story that came out about how Fox News

1126
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:11,583
Is the mouthpiece in the propaganda arm of the traffic by Erasure

1127
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:16,959
Yeah I'm like I imagine myself being Alex reading that story and being like

1128
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:19,007
This is the problem

1129
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:20,287
I was supposed

1130
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:21,823
Give me the state media

1131
00:58:24,383 --> 00:58:26,431
Fox News took my game

1132
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:28,735
Took my game and went pro with it

1133
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:35,135
He had I mean not

1134
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:36,159
See that coming

1135
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:36,927
Even in the early

1136
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:38,719
Of course

1137
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:40,255
I mean

1138
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:42,559
I don't I don't know

1139
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:43,583
That's what he wants

1140
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:45,887
But you wouldn't want to be

1141
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:46,655
B Fox News

1142
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:53,055
He wants to be the propaganda arm of the trumpet

1143
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:55,615
Stricter rules

1144
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:58,175
But that's what I'm saying

1145
00:58:58,431 --> 00:59:00,991
Even then he must be so angry

1146
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:03,295
To realize the extent of

1147
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:04,575
Yeah because

1148
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:07,903
That's that's it like one of his big selling point

1149
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:10,719
Being the state-run media is like

1150
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:14,047
See nobody nobody can regulate my s***

1151
00:59:14,303 --> 00:59:15,071
I don't give a

00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:19,167
Ffcc I don't care stupid

00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:20,191
Bright

1154
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:24,799
You guys could have picked me and they would never even though they would write a New Yorker story

1155
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:27,103
Yeah like I give a s*** you know

1156
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:29,663
Although on the other hand Fox News doesn't give a s*** either

1157
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:33,247
There is that there's more people on the record

1158
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:36,319
Around Fox Valley

1159
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:38,367
You got to get rid of mice

1160
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:41,439
You got to give it up to the Somali play

1161
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:48,607
So in the next clip Alex

1162
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:50,655
To say something

1163
01:00:06,015 --> 01:00:07,551
If it's all real

1164
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:08,319
Nope

1165
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:14,719
People say

1166
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:18,047
Exposing me

1167
01:00:24,191 --> 01:00:26,751

System here has prize in the world

1169
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:49,791
The Patriot

1170
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:51,327
The Americans

1171
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:53,375
Greatest Prize

1172
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:54,911
And they're willing to Nuka City

1173
01:00:55,423 --> 01:00:56,447
In order to

1174
01:00:56,959 --> 01:00:58,239
Make Alex look bad

1175
01:00:58,751 --> 01:00:59,263
Be arrested

1176
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:04,383
I don't see how that's not trying to scare people

1177
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:05,919
No

1178
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:08,735
The anime

1179
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:14,111
Is willing to kill Millions upon millions of people Scorch the Earth around them

1180
01:01:14,623 --> 01:01:17,183
Possibly cause lasting radioactive damage

1181
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:18,975
To the entire world

1182
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:23,583
In order to arrest

1183
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:27,167
Right that's not that scary little narcissism

1184
01:01:30,751 --> 01:01:32,799
Anybody who expresses feelings of

1185
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:33,567
Lawson

1186
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:36,127

Buildings at

1188
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:46,367
Why would you care about these 20 people

1189
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:47,135
Million

1190
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:49,439
Because they're going to Nuke the city

1191
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:55,839
Upside down

1192
01:01:56,095 --> 01:01:59,423
December twenty

1193
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:00,959
Alex

1194
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:05,823
Understood in the

1195
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:06,847
Text of all the other things

1196
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:08,639
All this points

1197
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:10,175
Like in recent days

1198
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:12,991
Keep seeing this video of Robbie Parker

1199
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:15,039
Suspicious

1200
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:16,575
Actors

1201
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:19,135
Like an actor up there this needs

1202
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:19,903
To be investigate

1203
01:02:20,927 --> 01:02:21,951
Smells too high

1204
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:23,231
People need to invest

1205
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:24,511
The globalist

1206
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:25,279
Plaintiff

1207
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:26,559
Lucas.

1208
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:30,143
Takeout are patriots The Greatest Prize

1209
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:31,679
In the known world

1210
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:36,031
It doesn't make

1211
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:42,943
Everybody's face

1212
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:45,247
Radio

1213
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:12,383
Okay

1214
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:13,407
So

1215
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:17,503
Really weird to hear that level of

1216
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:18,527
Scaremongering

1217
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:20,319
Over what sound

1218
01:03:20,575 --> 01:03:26,719
Seems like the track from a Jane Fonda workout video

1219
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:27,743
I do know what you mean

1220
01:03:28,255 --> 01:03:29,279
Yeah it's strange

1221
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:32,351
Glutes

1222
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:35,935
It's disconcerting

1223
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:37,215
Certainly

1224
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:40,031
The idea of like if you love your family better get really Act

1225
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:42,847
Local access

1226
01:03:43,103 --> 01:03:43,615
You got to get in people

1227
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:45,151
Whose faces you got it you got it

1228
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:46,687
Infront everybody tubes

1229
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:51,551
That's probably just an expression of

1230
01:03:51,807 --> 01:03:52,319
If you guys

1231
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:54,367
Do these they

1232
01:03:54,879 --> 01:03:56,159
It's only going to feed people to me

1233
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:56,927
Exactly

1234
01:03:57,183 --> 01:03:59,999
Because you'll be like

1235
01:04:00,255 --> 01:04:00,767

Context of all

1243
01:04:17,407 --> 01:04:18,687
You need to get aggressive

1244
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:20,991
If you love your family you got to get really active

1245
01:04:21,503 --> 01:04:22,783
Occupying government

As he has already said people need to do

1249
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:34,815
The getting really active part there is

1250
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:37,375
It's just frustrating

1251
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:41,471
Contact drop from

We're to the 21st the end of the world

1261
01:05:03,743 --> 01:05:05,023
David icon

1262
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:08,095
It's mostly just talking about

1263
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:09,119
How

1264
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:10,911
You know there are evil forces in

1265
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:11,935
In the world

1266
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:13,471
Course the world knocking

1267
01:05:13,983 --> 01:05:14,495
That is most

1268
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:17,055
Conversation

1269
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:18,079
About

Sandy Hook

1271
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:20,639
Now we see

1272
01:05:21,407 --> 01:05:22,687
These ideas that Alex is already

1273
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:24,479
The Batman

1274
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:27,807
Jane Fonda workouts

1275
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:30,111
That doesn't come in play specifically

1276
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:31,903
He's probably in the background song

1277
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:32,927
So Alex

1278
01:05:34,207 --> 01:05:35,743
Have this conversation

1279
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:41,375
Awful

1280
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:49,055
Well I just think it with heading to Alex to a point in the New Year in 2013

1281
01:05:49,311 --> 01:05:52,127
When somebody sings going to come together

1282
01:05:53,663 --> 01:05:57,247
Good point election to win

1283
01:05:57,759 --> 01:05:59,295
We have space

1284
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:03,647
Clifford talking about

1285
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:05,951
Obvious agenda

Poochon down the rose

1287
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:13,631
If people

1288
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:17,471
Absolutely

1289
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:19,007
NAU

And the rest of the people

1293
01:06:28,479 --> 01:06:34,623
Actually an object

1294
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:42,303
Interesting

1295
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:47,423
Enum

1296
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:52,287

Recorders from

1299
01:07:20,191 --> 01:07:21,215
The manipulation of

1300
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:23,775
The human subconscious mind which then becomes

1301
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:26,591
The conscious Minds perception of reality

1302
01:07:27,103 --> 01:07:29,407
I don't care about that Batman nonsense

1303
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:35,039
Do people not know how f****** stupid that is

1304
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:39,903
Anybody listen to David I cannot go

1305

Lips a lot through his nose and

1308
01:07:54,495 --> 01:07:55,263
Dumbfucks

1309
01:07:57,055 --> 01:08:01,151
It is true that

1310
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:01,919
Who's the author of The Hunger

1311
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:08,575
Did live in Sandy Hook Village

1312
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:11,135
Also Caitlyn Jenner formerly live there too

1313
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:12,159
Is that meaningful

1314
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:14,719
The actor Anthony Edwards used to live there

1315
01:08:14,975 --> 01:08:15,487
So what

1316
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:18,303
The author of The Lost weekend live there

1317
01:08:18,559 --> 01:08:20,095

01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:23,167
Jenna von Oy who plays sticks

1319
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:24,703
What the high school in San Diego

We're Spix's hat

1321
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:27,007
Part of the globalist

Actually that is I don't know I would really valid I would believe that

1323
01:08:33,663 --> 01:08:35,967

One of the best directors in film history

1332
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:22,815
Play we forgot.

1333
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:25,375
People who are from places

1334
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:29,215
So-called

1335
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:36,127
F*** you better better to like work on it

1336
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:41,247
You can't that's a shortcut

1337
01:09:43,295 --> 01:09:44,319
To do

1338
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:49,951
First

1339
01:09:50,207 --> 01:09:51,231
Not investigating

1340
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:54,303
And second saying that they are not coincidences

1341
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:56,351
That's proving my dumb argument

1342
01:09:56,607 --> 01:09:58,143
And the plot of The Hunger Games

1343
01:09:58,399 --> 01:09:59,167
We have nothing to do

1344
01:09:59,423 --> 01:09:59,935
Due West

1345
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:00,959
The shooting

1346
01:10:01,471 --> 01:10:06,591
Not so number one battle royale when she was high in protein

1347
01:10:07,103 --> 01:10:08,895
Really have to do with

1348
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:11,711
The directions

1349
01:10:11,967 --> 01:10:12,991
Yes

1350
01:10:13,247 --> 01:10:14,271
Great economic

1351
01:10:14,527 --> 01:10:15,295
Different

1352
01:10:17,855 --> 01:10:18,367
The classes

1353
01:10:18,623 --> 01:10:19,647
That is true

1354
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:21,695
The social stratification

1355
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:23,231
Aspect of the movie

1356
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:25,279
But

1357
01:10:26,303 --> 01:10:27,327
The movie is about a cat

1358
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:28,351
Contact

1359
01:10:28,607 --> 01:10:34,239
Yeah we still haven't gotten to nor is there any indication that that is diverse

1360
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:38,335
That's true

1361
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:41,919
So here is the last clip from

1362
01:10:42,687 --> 01:10:43,455
Where are they

1363
01:10:45,503 --> 01:10:47,807
You can look at Sandy Hook

1364
01:10:53,951 --> 01:10:54,975
It's about

1365
01:10:55,743 --> 01:11:00,607
An excuse to take guns away because of the same reason that they stopped

1366
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:07,007
Johnson ammunition

1367
01:11:18,783 --> 01:11:19,807
Another one next

1368
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:23,903
To to create emotional trauma

1369
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:30,303
Collectively in the population

1370
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:42,335
You're talkin about psychic vampires with David Icke

1371
01:11:45,407 --> 01:11:48,735
Ridiculous

1372
01:11:48,991 --> 01:11:49,503
Staged

1373
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:51,039
On his

1374
01:11:51,295 --> 01:11:55,903
They're doing it to create emotional trauma on a worldwide basis

1375
01:11:56,927 --> 01:12:01,791
All in on the little bit harder it is

1376
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:03,583
Yeah Alex's

1377
01:12:04,607 --> 01:12:05,631
It's not good

1378
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:06,399
It's not good

1379
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:07,167
2

1380
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:08,191
Have these ideas

1381
01:12:08,447 --> 01:12:09,983
Presented on your show on challenge

1382
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:11,263
If they're not ideas that

1383
01:12:11,519 --> 01:12:12,031
You don't want

1384
01:12:12,543 --> 01:12:13,311
Your audience

1385
01:12:15,615 --> 01:12:16,127
It's just a b

1386
01:12:19,455 --> 01:12:20,479
I still don't think

1387
01:12:20,735 --> 01:12:22,271
We've we've reached the

1388
01:12:22,527 --> 01:12:23,039
The point where he

1389
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:24,319
He's fully committed to

1390
01:12:24,831 --> 01:12:26,879
This was fake argument or anything

1391
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:28,671
But we're past the end of the world

1392
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:31,231
And we've seen the continuation of the

1393
01:12:32,255 --> 01:12:34,303
Wall-to-wall gun show Gap

1394
01:12:34,815 --> 01:12:36,351
And the breaking of that pattern

1395
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:37,119
With one of the

1396
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:41,983
The craziest people who exist in the world

1397
01:12:42,751 --> 01:12:43,263
This drama

1398
01:12:43,775 --> 01:12:44,287
And all this stuff

1399
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:47,871
Swarthy

1400
01:12:48,127 --> 01:12:50,175
Nada

1401
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:50,943
Confident

1402
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:52,479
But Alex is going to find gooseberry

1403
01:12:52,991 --> 01:12:53,503
At all

1404
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:57,343
That last one there

1405
01:12:57,599 --> 01:12:58,879
Alex

1406
01:12:59,135 --> 01:12:59,903
Concerned this is going to

1407
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:01,695
To create copycat

1408
01:13:01,951 --> 01:13:02,463
School shooter

1409
01:13:06,303 --> 01:13:10,911
Nothing in terms of regulating gun laws

1410
01:13:12,447 --> 01:13:14,751
You are you can be pretty confident that was going to

1411
01:13:16,799 --> 01:13:20,383
And then you can just say that I called this these are all because of

1412
01:13:20,895 --> 01:13:22,175
Yeah the last one

1413
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:27,551
Is all just copycatting off the last one pretty sure that you

1414
01:13:27,807 --> 01:13:29,087
Have some culpability

1415
01:13:29,343 --> 01:13:30,111
In those f******

1416
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:33,695
I'm not willing to go that far

1417
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:35,231
Is not

1418
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:36,511
Certainly not

1419
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:38,815
But I'm not sure of

1420
01:13:39,071 --> 01:13:39,583
What

1421
01:13:40,607 --> 01:13:41,119
He's guilty

1422
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:43,935
Sounds

1423
01:13:44,959 --> 01:13:46,751
Sounds like

1424
01:13:47,263 --> 01:13:48,543
Nervous book

1425
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:49,311
Do you like easy

1426
01:13:53,407 --> 01:13:55,967
F*** you

1427
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:57,247
You're a f******

1428
01:13:58,271 --> 01:13:59,807
He is

1429
01:14:00,063 --> 01:14:02,111
He's not he doesn't even believe the dump

1430
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:03,903
Listen to

1431
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:05,183
He might

1432
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:10,047
I kind of regret earlier episode of this show I might have said he

1433
01:14:10,303 --> 01:14:11,071
He has some

1434
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:16,191
Just respond

1435
01:14:16,703 --> 01:14:18,239
Like the vague self-help stuff

1436
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:20,543
That is incorporated within all the other day

1437
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:21,823
Message

1438
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:23,871
Defense

1439
01:14:26,943 --> 01:14:27,711
They could get anywhere

1440
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:31,039
Goop for a cake

1441
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:32,831
Self-help

1442
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:34,367
I think I probably

1443
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:37,439
Yasso

1444
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:39,999
Wasn't hard enough on David Icke

1445
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:41,791
But

1446
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:44,351
So I don't know I don't know what the end of this

1447
01:14:44,607 --> 01:14:45,119
What

1448
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:46,911
What will you

1449
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:48,191
Receive

1450
01:14:49,983 --> 01:14:50,495
Progression

1451
01:14:50,751 --> 01:14:52,799
I think we're still seeing a bit of a holding pattern

1452
01:14:53,311 --> 01:14:54,079
Is part

1453
01:14:54,335 --> 01:14:58,943
I think you're starting to feed the audience catch up to him

1454
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:01,759
Salacious

1455
01:15:02,015 --> 01:15:03,551
More calls you're seeing that influence

1456
01:15:03,807 --> 01:15:04,575
Come into the program

1457
01:15:05,343 --> 01:15:06,879
And then the idea

1458
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:08,927
December

1459
01:15:09,439 --> 01:15:10,719
21st 2012 showing

1460
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:11,743
Have David icon

1461
01:15:11,999 --> 01:15:13,535
But because of the timing of it

1462
01:15:13,791 --> 01:15:16,351
David Icke is also introducing a lot of really bad idea

1463
01:15:17,631 --> 01:15:18,911
Sam evolution

1464
01:15:19,167 --> 01:15:20,447
We'll see where it goes

1465
01:15:20,959 --> 01:15:22,495
Well the fact that brings up

1466
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:23,519
The feedback loop

1467
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:24,799
As being like Alex

1468
01:15:25,055 --> 01:15:27,103
Bringing up the feedback loop as being some

1469
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:29,919
Part of this whole

1470
01:15:30,687 --> 01:15:31,967
Yet not realizing that

1471
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:34,527
He's in that feedback loop with all of his gas

1472
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:36,319
With all of his collars

1473
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:41,695
Of him saying s*** and they're all just mirror

1474
01:15:41,951 --> 01:15:42,975
She is in this

1475
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:43,999
Constant like

1476
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:46,047
Hanby

1477
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:47,071
No in

1478
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:47,839
Information

1479
01:15:48,351 --> 01:15:48,863
That

1480
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:50,399
Is that I

1481
01:15:50,911 --> 01:15:51,679
Will interact

1482
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:53,727
That is not supporting my

1483
01:15:54,495 --> 01:15:55,263
Yeah

1484
01:15:55,519 --> 01:15:56,287
He doesn't realize

1485
01:15:57,055 --> 01:15:59,615
Part of the loop in the same way

1486
01:15:59,871 --> 01:16:00,639
He's a part of politics

1487
01:16:03,711 --> 01:16:04,735
He is a part of the thing that

1488
01:16:05,503 --> 01:16:07,039
Yeah it is much as like

1489
01:16:07,295 --> 01:16:08,063
Basically just

1490
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:09,343
Virginia Morgan

1491
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:10,111
Of

1492
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:11,903
Like you

1493
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:14,975
Like I'm above the right left

1494
01:16:15,231 --> 01:16:16,511
Perpetuate

1495
01:16:17,023 --> 01:16:17,791
Is 2

1496
01:16:18,047 --> 01:16:18,815
Try to work

1497
01:16:19,071 --> 01:16:20,095
The Bush People further right

1498
01:16:20,351 --> 01:16:23,935
Right

1499
01:16:25,471 --> 01:16:25,983
YouTube Ozzy

1500
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:27,519
Left-right paradigm

1501
01:16:30,335 --> 01:16:30,847
This feedback loop

1502
01:16:31,103 --> 01:16:31,615
It's going on

1503
01:16:32,127 --> 01:16:33,407
When he is pushing it

1504
01:16:33,663 --> 01:16:34,943
Super far towards

1505
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:36,223
The Sandy Hook was fake

1506
01:16:36,735 --> 01:16:37,503
Mentality

1507
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:38,527
Oh yeah so

1508
01:16:38,783 --> 01:16:39,551
Yeah that's a good point

1509
01:16:40,063 --> 01:16:40,831
He doesn't realize it

1510
01:16:42,879 --> 01:16:43,391
Hopefully

1511
01:16:43,903 --> 01:16:44,671
Hopefully will be

1512
01:16:44,927 --> 01:16:45,695
Further

1513
01:16:46,463 --> 01:16:47,743
Event

1514
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:48,511
Progress

1515
01:16:52,863 --> 01:16:54,143
But until then

1516
01:17:00,799 --> 01:17:06,175
We are ozone's we are

1517
01:17:06,431 --> 01:17:08,991
We are

1518
01:17:10,527 --> 01:17:11,039
We're great

1519
01:17:12,575 --> 01:17:13,599
Dolphin do

1520
01:17:13,855 --> 01:17:14,623
High-pitched voices

1521
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:20,255
Really really phone am in phone in those plugs

1522
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:24,607
Yeah I'm looking over this and I'm not seeing anybody I like
