1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Galaxy color with huge fan I love your work

2
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:16,384
Little bit about Alex Jones

3
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,968
Left behind

4
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:26,112
Tom and Jerry

5
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,904
Yeah I think so

6
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,536
It's like Harry Potter but I thought they were trash I was in that

7
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:36,096
Evangelical

8
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,656
I thought they were a little bit stupid

9
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:42,752
My dad is a religious studies professor

10
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,800
So

11
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:46,848
Later

12
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,664
Because I was going through my dad

13
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:54,272
I wasn't going through their house but I was in their house

14
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:57,088
The first one he had a copy of The DaVinci Code

15
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:06,048
Copy of

16
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:07,072
I left behind

17
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:10,656
Not the book I think it was a copy of the DVD

18
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:12,960
Collector's edition

19
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:16,800
What do you have

20
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:25,504
Company that made it apparently

21
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:30,368
For him

22
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:39,072
Hoping to get like a a blurb or something I think

23
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:42,912
Without losing

24
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:46,240
QuickBooks

25
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:47,776
Send things really hard for my parents

26
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,824
To get rid of

27
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:55,712
Yeah go to bookstores in only like books otherwise I would be covered

28
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,272
House fire

29
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:06,208
My house burned down years ago I ate a giant Library bus I told myself I was going to rebuild it

30
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:07,488
Yeah and then afterwards I do

31
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:08,512
I just realized like

32
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:10,560
These are kind of empowerment

33
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:11,584
Then I would like

34
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,864
Whatever

35
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,656
Pics of a lot of space

36
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:15,936
Baltimore

37
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:18,496
Selective of what books

38
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:19,264
What I just

39
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,104
Find PDFs on Kindle

40
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,176
Kiryu

41
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,200
Do fetishize

42
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,480
Actual books

43
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:30,528
There's something very funny about that

44
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,064
So beautiful

45
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:32,832
Tactile

46
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:33,856
Absolutely

47
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,416
Mouthfeel for a book mouthfeel for a

48
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:40,000
A lot of books

49
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:44,608
His bulge

50
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,632
Correct

51
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:48,448
We're going back to the past

52
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,984
Because I want to tell you this

53
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,520
I wanted to stay in the present

54
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:56,896
It's an exciting time for Alex Jones right now in 2019

55
00:02:57,152 --> 00:03:00,736
But I realized after our last episode the pretty much the next week

56
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:04,576
Going to just be him talking about that project Veritas Google video

57
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:06,112
I think I said about all I need

58
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:08,928
Need to say about it on our last episode

59
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,768
More time going over him yelling about it

60
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:13,792
Not a lot of value

61
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,120
In our 2013 investigation

62
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:20,704
Going over what Alex in the aftermath of

63
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:24,800
15th of February

64
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,080
2013

65
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:28,640
If you'll recall on our last installment Alec

66
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:31,200
Wattpad started to turn a little bit of a corner

67
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,224
Call Christopher Doran

68
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,088
I'm nothing if not a broadcaster

69
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:40,416
Chris daughter died

70
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,696
He killed himself on

71
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:44,768
The 12th Alex started

72
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:45,536
To compare

73
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:47,072
A situation of his death

74
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,120
The Galaxy

75
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:49,888

76
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:50,656
Super cool

00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:51,936

79
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,520
He said the government that killed them

80
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:59,104
So I'm comparing daughter to Waco is

81
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,384
Is big deal

82
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,688
Like that's something that indicates the position

83
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,712

00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,992

I don't know

135
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:09,311

145
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:04,351
I would like to direct Alex's

146
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,375
Come to the

147
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:08,191
Christian

148
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:11,007
That's a pretty good the debunker

149
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,823
Because what he's doing is try to universalize

150
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,663
You know there's nothing

151
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,199
Necessarily

152
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:23,551
Terroristic of how Christianity or anything like that but that's a group.

153
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:27,391
Is the

154
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:32,511
Described are the things that somebody says

155
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:35,071
Right before they become a terrorist

156
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:41,983
You know we're working 17 hours a day

157
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:44,543
We need to stop this

00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:47,615

159
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:49,151

160
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,711
Pretends were set up

161
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:52,479
So

162
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:55,295
Real slow start to the 14th

163
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,831
February 14th

164
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:57,599
Episode

165
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:04,511
From the beginning of it's a full Clips out of

166
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:05,279
Because

167
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:12,447
Decided to take this opportunity to this clip

168
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:14,751
So much of the words

169
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:15,775
Salad

170
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:16,799
To make his point

171
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,103
Nothing in this

172
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,639
Text clip is saying

173
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:23,711
Okay but it's the sort of thing to populate

174
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:25,247
So much of his

175
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:26,527
Spelling

176
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:32,927
Response

177
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:39,071
Normalcy

178
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:43,423
Cowardly

179
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:56,223
Such a good indication of just like

180
00:09:56,735 --> 00:10:02,879
I'm swinging from the monkey bars I do not know where my next needs to go next is there a

181
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:07,487
Learned helplessness Overton Window hours

182
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:13,887
Jewel Osco dogs are everywhere

183
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:17,471
Is anybody

184
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:24,127
The what Alex's do cuz he's hungry

185
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:26,943
Froot Loops that says 1 + 1 equals 5

186
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:33,343
84

187
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:39,743
I think what it has to do with is like 1 and 1 are Fruit Loops and milk and then 5 is

188
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:45,375
Like 5 nutrition

189
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:49,727
Spell fruit

190
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:56,639
I'll tell you why the globalist trying to dumb down the population it sounds

191
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:59,199
So at some point

192
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:03,039
Do some actual issues and he starts talking about Christopher

193
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,087
This point I think

194
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,111
Is there a badger

195
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,695
Yeah especially with his rhetoric

196
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:10,719
Run SO3

197
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,999
Through the coverage of

198
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,791
Hey man you think this is bad

199
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:20,447
Yeah see what happens

200
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,775
I feel like that line of rhetoric is not good

201
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,079
Kind of worse

202
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:37,343
What

203
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:01,919
So he's giving advice on how to kill more cops

204
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:05,503
Justifying on air

205
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:09,855
Anybody who doesn't actually want to commit a math terrorist attack doesn't already

206
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:10,879
Know that

207
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:14,975
That doesn't help

208
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:25,471
He seemed so he thought a lot about killing cops that's what we read a lot of books

209
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:30,079
About the

210
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:34,943
What was really interesting about that is Alex is almost taken offense

211
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:36,735
The idea that people are saying

212
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,527
Trained

213
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:41,599
Almost as if to say like

214
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:46,207
Now our guys are trained

215
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,231
Is there some

216
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:53,631
Is there some reason

217
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,519
Like

218
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:01,567
You guys haven't

219
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:06,687
A Praying are crazy

220
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,711
It's almost like

221
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,991
The very fact that you

222
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:09,759
At him

223
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:11,551
Means that you wasn't good enough

224
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:18,207
I think

225
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,231
Disappearance

226
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:21,535
Yeah it's it's more of a

227
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,863
Threat

228
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:29,727
I think it's

229
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:32,287
Brag

230
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,567
But okay

231
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,735
The first one

232
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,783
Is there a guy who is

233
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:46,111
Alright I guess does he have a tail

234
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:49,439
He doesn't have telescope that I know of but here's Alex

235
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:02,751
Available I should add

236
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:09,151
Infowars.com

237
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,807
What is going on

238
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:18,367
So he's got this guy

239
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:20,671
Dr. Cory gold

240
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,951
Spokesperson

241
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:23,231
There is no other

242
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,255
You seem to have him on the show

243
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,535
Alex is presenting

244
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:31,679
Are you heard it as someone who lives in Southern California

245
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:36,543
Millions of people live in California

246
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,311
Easily talk to

247
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,615
He's a syndicated radio host

248
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,151
You look to station

249
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:47,551
He is not a big time radio host no expertise in the area that Alex's

250
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,319
Talk about

251
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:51,391
This is just a shoehorn infomercial for youngevity

252
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:54,719
Which is what the interview ends of deteriorating into because of course

253
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:57,023
The only reason he's on the show

254
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:57,791
Stretching

255
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:00,351
So far to make it relevant like

256
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,631
Oh yeah we got to

257
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:08,031
Guy without California give us the dirt on what it's like California

258
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:12,383
Crazy there's there's over

259
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,455
Sew-in ethical

260
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:17,503
Because it just does he doesn't have much

261
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,295
To say about the daughter situation with

262
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,319
It's not already like

263
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:22,367
If he's read an article

264
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:24,671
And he's repeating what's in an article

265
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:26,463
Which doesn't make him the most

266
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:30,559
Expert

267
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:32,863
His Dentistry doesn't seem relevant

268
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:36,959
I don't know if you're wasn't killed by a giant

269
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:40,799
So don't know what Dentistry is going to

270
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:41,823
Come into this

271
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,383
Here is the indication of how things

272
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,151
Do this

273
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,431
This is really

274
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,199
How the interviewer

275
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:08,703
So it's kind of

276
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:15,871
Yeah yeah that's not Great Britain that he's dumb b******* about that subsection

277
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,407
Sarcastically

278
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,943
Not plugging

279
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,247
Youngevity

280
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,295
Long stretches where they're like

281
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,575
Presumably

282
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:26,623
Talking about it in service of the news

283
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:28,671
Just talk about how great the product

284
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:32,255
Crazy it's embarrassing

285
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,279
Embarrassed

286
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,559
Yeah to behave like this

287
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:38,399
Alex

288
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,679
It is

289
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,335
So interesting you bring that up

290
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:48,127
Because I've still relevant to Alex

291
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,711
Alex

292
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:53,503
Talk

293
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:54,783
Probably some connection

294
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,319
But

295
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:58,879
Here he brings up who his next guy

296
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,999
Evidence goes back to his

297
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,023
Piers Morgan obsession

298
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,559
Can a little bit but

299
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:28,319
Joseph

300
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,647
So Alex is pretending

301
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:33,951
Don't talk much about the Piers Morgan stuff

302
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:36,767
Ludacris we talked about it all the f****** time

303
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:37,791
But he wants to

304
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,839
Joseph Farah what do you think

305
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,143
I do not

306
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:44,959
Joseph Perez the founder of WorldNetDaily

307
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:48,543
One of the absolute worst large-scale news sites online and what about

308
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,311
What is MainSource

309
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,335
Information

310
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:53,407
History the real interest

311
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,175
Subject

312
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:58,271
Possibly one that I would love to get into much more deeply on another day

313
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,063
I meant to do a deep dive on his

314
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:05,439
Stupidity and how he found his way to WorldNetDaily only after running multiple other outlets out of business

315
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:07,487
How fair is directly responsible for

316
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:08,767
For Trump's birther claims

317
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,303
And maybe even

318
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,095
Debra chance to look into the trim

319
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:15,167
They're clearly on display when you look at the books that WorldNetDaily

320
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,191
Chooses to publish

321
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:18,751
But my research went off track just a little bit

322
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:21,055
When I ran into a salon article

323
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:24,383
It dovetails into what you were just saying

324
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,151
About Shane

325
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,967
World

326
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:31,551
7 and 4 years very similar position in Media

327
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:34,879
Crazy s*** about them

328
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:35,647
Conserve depressed

329
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:36,415
Wouldn't

330
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,183
They floated

331
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:39,231
Conspiracy theories a traffic jam explicit

332
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:41,023
Coded bigotry

333
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:42,559
But now

334
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:44,351
In 2019 they are falling a

335
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,399
Hey much the same way Alex

336
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,167
Businesses

337
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:48,959
Both of these organization

338
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:52,543
Explain but their downfall is being caused by an oppressive company

339
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,103
Because their message

340
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:55,871
Just too dangerous

341
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:58,943
But this Salon article written by Amanda Marcotte

342
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,479
Makes a really interesting

343
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:01,247
Point

344
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:04,575
No one cares about WorldNetDaily in Infowars anymore

345
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:07,135
Because Fox News is now doing what they used to do

346
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,439
But with a better budget and more access

347
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,207
The talent

348
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,999
As the article says quote

349
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:18,399
Conservative audiences want to wallow in fantasy world where women have abortions for fun

350
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,423
Coming to kill you

351
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,495
Globalist to running elaborate secretive conspiracies

352
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:24,287
Bastille America from white people

353
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:26,591
No longer have to turn to WorldNetDaily

354
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:30,431
With its subpar web design and often incomprehensibly written article

355
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:32,479
The conspiracy theories

356
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:33,759
His paranoia those audience

357
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:35,807
Served up in a slick

358
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,599
Professional style at Fox News

359
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:41,439
In the mouths of supposedly reputable pundits like Tucker Carlson

360
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,207
And Sean Hannity

361
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:49,887
Supposedly

362
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:52,191
Whatever the matter of perspective

363
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,727
But that's a really good point

364
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:55,007
Years Joseph

365
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:57,823
Crucial role in the

366
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:58,591
Motorcycle

367
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:02,175
They drove tons of votes to right-wing candidates but they really only

368
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:02,943
Useful as long as

369
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:05,247
People in power never acknowledge them

370
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:06,783
As soon as politician

371
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:08,319
Particularly Trump

372
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:12,927
Began trying to trying to help the public become more

373
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:16,767
Who's only a matter of time before world that has started

374
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:17,535
Actual cop

375
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,559
Petition pop-up

376
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:21,119
It really appears that neither of them were up to the challenge

377
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:24,447
Ultimately what you have with Joseph Farah is a

378
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:26,751
Debbie loser who found a really profit

379
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:28,799
People nice in a market that most people have

380
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:29,823
Too much dignity to

381
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:31,615
Then Along Came

382
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:33,407
Lower the bar of what

383
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,687
Dignified so far

384
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:39,295
The people who would previously have been ashamed to traffic and Ferris brand of b*******

385
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,063
Found themselves

386
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:42,879
The position where was no longer career suicide to roll

387
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:43,903
That shitt

388
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:46,719
What little thing. It's not about Trump

389
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:49,791
Confero 2011 when Trump was getting

390
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:53,119
Obama's birth certificate

391
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:58,239
Literally call Joseph Farah and then WorldNetDaily employee Jerome corsi

392
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:02,335
Quote looking for affirmation that he was on the right track

393
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:05,663
Sarah told the New York Times that he was impressed

394
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,967
But how many hours Trump was willing to put in

395
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:08,735
To the birth

396
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:11,039
Knox

397
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:17,440
It's like

398
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,720
How Alex

399
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,256
Served by

400
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:21,792
Anti-semite

401
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:23,584
Out-and-out anti-semites

402
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,352
Saying that he's

403
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,240
Acceptable mainstream

404
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:32,288
Alex

405
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:34,848
Probably

406
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:35,616
Do that

407
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,432
In the same way that Fox News used to ignore that

408
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,480
Now that they didn't have it at

409
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:41,504
Just fine they like

410
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:46,624
Cool because now.

411
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,648
Because of that

412
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:48,928
Because of the phenomenon

413
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:49,696
It's happening

414
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,512
Where what Alex used to do is being done better

415
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:54,048
Fox News and other

416
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:56,096
More heavily funded Outlets

417
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:57,632
The Overton window shift

418
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:03,008
So far that's alright guys it's cool now

419
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:05,312
Baltimore overt white mask

420
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:06,336
Nationalism

421
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,104
Privacy

422
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,640
White identity ideas

423
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:11,456
Express things that he probably would have been

424
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:16,064
Not interested

425
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:17,088
78

426
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:18,368
Years ago now

427
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,136
What is Vine

428
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:23,488
He would speak in code vac then whereas now there is a

429
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,768
Real

430
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:26,048
Real f****** trend

431
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:31,424
And I think I think it's just because he's suffering

432
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:37,824
Do those

433
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:41,664
Beneath the surface ugly

434
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,432
Things

435
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:45,504
Skis just

436
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,528
Lower on the totem

437
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,952
Quarry Gold's not a good gas but Joseph has like a big deal

438
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:55,744
Conservative media

439
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:59,584
Like he's he's a he's a guy who runs WorldNetDaily

440
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,608
That's a

441
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,632
Install

442
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:02,400
Circles

443
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,240
Can we just acknowledge that we're listening to an episode

444
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:07,264
In 2000

445
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,544
+ 13

446
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,848
Kill 1.6

447
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:11,616
6 billion tops

448
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:15,456
Man in the good old days

449
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:21,344
Hypothetical

450
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:29,024
What are on here

451
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,608
That are

452
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,400
That's someone who never come on now

453
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:36,704
Fast-forward to the present

454
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:38,496
Count dankula

455
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:41,056
The level of

456
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:43,872
You talkin to

457
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:51,040
I guess if I were to describe him

458
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:58,208
I would like to do more about him and I would have loved to do that today

459
00:23:58,976 --> 00:23:59,488
Another f****** a

460
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,768
The show

461
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:06,912
Decided we'll get to it later I would say

462
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:07,680
He is

463
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:09,216
Alex Jones

464
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:10,496
With a mustache

465
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:14,592
Runza media operation

466
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:16,640
The radio show

467
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:18,432
Operation

468
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,456
That is

469
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:21,760
Surfing almost identical inter

470
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,832
They pitch similar story

471
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:27,136
Alex uses them as a source all

472
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:28,928
It's basically

473
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:31,488
It's two guys who are in League with each other

474
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:36,096
In a pop like a propaganda ping pong

475
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,888
Quote on quote

476
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,752
Telenovela

477
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,800
It doesn't matter which one has the mustache

478
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:46,080
Yes that would be

479
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:46,848
That would be fair

480
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,152
Sophie is about to come up on the

481
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:50,176
Michelle

482
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,712
Alex

483
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:54,016
Yes come back from

484
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:54,784
Commercial

485
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,344
About a commercial that you

Are you sponsoring I'm sorry

488
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:18,336
This is just trying to reinforce my new thesis but Alex thinks poop

489
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:19,872
Is hilarious

490
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:21,152
Years old

491
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:26,784
What activity

492
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:28,832
You love's f******

493
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:29,856
Humor

494
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,136
It's crazy

495
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:33,952
Almost never here

496
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:37,792
Sincere or Genuine last man that doesn't involve fecal matter

497
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:38,560
Crazy

498
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:41,120
Weird so

499
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:41,888
Sarah

500
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:42,656
His interview

501
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:44,192
The real

502
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:45,472
Troubling things

503
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:47,008
Because this is the first thing you hear

504
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,288
From Joseph

505
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:50,848
Situations

506
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:02,880
Takeouts

507
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:04,416
I don't know that's

508
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,184
From him

509
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,512
From now from Farah

510
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:11,840
That's pretty f***** up like Alex's bringing up this

511
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:13,376
This situation

512
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:16,704
Itsfunneh well I mean

513
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,080
Is it correct

514
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:24,896
Human response

515
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,456
Like a James Bond song

516
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:31,552
There's a little bit too upsetting

517
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:37,184
That's a really all that interesting their positions on

518
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:40,000
The situation it doesn't there's no real development

519
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,024
There's no

520
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:42,304
Nothing

521
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:43,328
Fresh

522
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:44,608
But

523
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:46,912
His next clip Alex is trying

524
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:50,752
About Chris Kyle

525
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:53,568
The American Sniper guy who had just been murdered

526
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:54,592
Like a week prior

527
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:58,688
And it turns out I don't think the Joseph Farah nose hoop

528
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:00,224
How is

529
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:03,552
Chris Kyle sniper

530
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:09,440
Why

531
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:15,072
Well yeah I mean that you know is surrounded

532
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:19,168
Well I mean

533
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,984
Cinema Stratford

534
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,008
WinCo

535
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:26,336
Ruby Ridge back in the day

536
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:28,896
He thinks he's talking about Chris Jordan

537
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,480
He doesn't recognize

538
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:35,808
Sniper register

539
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:37,600
But does go on to

540
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:42,720
It's like Waco which makes me think

541
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:45,280
I think this might be something as it is

542
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:49,376
Universal investor Alex Jones world

543
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:50,400
Propaganda

544
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:54,752
Especially if they could have had their own pre-production

545
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,824
The night before

546
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:59,616
Is this a lot like Waco

547
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:04,736
Who knows if they did or didn't

548
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:07,808
Probably didn't but it does seem like a

549
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:11,136
You know at least Joseph Farah has a like

550
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:13,696
A little

551
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:14,720
A little

552
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:19,072
Nothing else really work

553
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:19,840
Recovering in it

554
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:21,376
So we're going to jump

555
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,168
I'll get to the point

556
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:24,704
Where Alex starts

557
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,312
Real

558
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,080
Winners in

559
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:31,360
In the color category

560
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:34,944
We have

561
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:41,344
Oh okay we have of course old man house phone

562
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,880
Starting to recognize

563
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:45,184
As like real regular folks

564
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,512
And I've heard this dude before but I don't know

565
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:49,280
Anyting

566
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:51,840
I don't remember when

567
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:54,144
But I've heard this f****** guy on the show before

568
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,704
It is soon as I heard his voice

569
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,520
The point is

570
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:05,920
General Colin Powell

571
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:16,928
Black people

572
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:23,840
Alex thinks it's funny that he's got this old racist color

573
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:28,704
Future responsibilities agitating the black

574
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:31,264
So

575
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,544
Call Beth

576
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:34,336
Oh man

577
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:36,640
Living in a world where is

578
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:39,968
I'm going to have this dude on my radio

579
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:43,552
I'm going to let him get away with calling him General Colin Powell

580
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:45,344
Alright

581
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:46,880
And then just go

582
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:50,464
He's agitating the Negroes and nobody's like hitting those

583
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:54,304
Nobody's doing that

584
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,584
Nobody's bothered by that

585
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:01,984
It's hilarious it's just a nice little fun jaunt down memory lane

586
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,776
Old white people

587
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:10,176
There's a little bit of cold water

588
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:13,760
Colon polyps

589
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:16,576
Is a different person

590
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:21,696
Is he referencing someone I am not aware of Noah turns out Colin Powell

591
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,792
School is really interesting is it Alex

592
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:32,448
And then it's interesting to me how he respond

593
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:33,216
Because

594
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:35,008
Next clip you see very clearly

595
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,080
Outwardly agree with this guy

596
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:42,432
Alex isn't this very well

597
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,200
Weird

598
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:43,968
Space

599
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:44,736
You can't

600
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:49,600
Fight with the guy who sang something really racist

601
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:51,392
If he agrees that means like yeah he is

602
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:52,416
The black

603
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:53,440
Then it becomes

604
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:56,512
Gotcha

605
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:58,048
Get dance

606
00:30:58,816 --> 00:30:59,840
What's today

607
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:01,632
The whites

608
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:14,176
Mueller

609
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:20,576
I don't want to check his stool specimen

610
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,792
It's just I've reached a point

611
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,776
Hilarious

612
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:51,040
Grocery store

613
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:54,880
In the world

614
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:59,232
He just shows up on the guy by party some more

615
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:00,512
Because he realizes

616
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:06,400
These impact like a no-win situation

617
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:09,216
He doesn't want to overly agree with the public

618
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:19,200
Well whenever he makes that little

619
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:19,968
In your likes

620
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:21,760
You know what word

621
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:28,416
That you don't you you stopped you started it and you're like I don't want that to be coming out of my mouth

622
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:30,464
But not much

623
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:33,024
I think

624
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:35,584
Right-thinking people

625
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:38,912
Like that as erring on the side of the

626
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,568
You on your radio show and you refused

627
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:46,848
Hey now

628
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:47,616
That means

629
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:49,664
You are at least tacitly

630
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,992
Or explicitly supporting the races position

631
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:54,016
Is expressing

632
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:55,552
So

633
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:56,576
I think that's what's going on

634
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:00,672
Whatever

635
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:01,440
You know

636
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:06,560
But what I think is really fast

637
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:08,864
Is what's revealed by this next caller

638
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:10,656
Business

639
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:11,680
Devastating

640
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:15,776
Alex's presume credibility

641
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:17,056
Thank you

642
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:19,616
I just wanted to share

643
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,920
Are you familiar with

644
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:23,712
Was Gregor Mendel

645
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:30,624
Gregor Mendel

646
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:32,160
Now tell me about it

647
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:37,792
Wow first one who's made his whole career railing against

648
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:40,096
The eugenicist globalist

649
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:46,240
And how the hell all these ideas about breeding and natural selection

650
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:48,032
Gregor Mendel

651
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:49,568
How embarrassing is that

652
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:55,968
All the way to Community College freshman biology

653
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:57,504
Bring up his education

654
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,528
On the 15th

655
00:33:58,784 --> 00:33:59,552
We'll get to that

656
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:01,856
That is disqualified

657
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:04,928
I understand if you're like I don't

658
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:06,976
Know a specific thing about his

659
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:09,536
Diyexperiment or something like that

660
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,072
Caller calls in

661
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:15,680
And he's like hey do you know about Gregor Mendel and you like no tell me about it

662
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:17,728
You don't know shitt

663
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:23,872
Have all the information at his disposal

664
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:27,968
But to be caught off-guard by call her bringing-up Mendel is like

665
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:29,504
You don't know dick

666
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,272
Pac-Man

667
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:31,808
Nuts

668
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:35,904
Unacceptable

669
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:40,256
Particularly unacceptable because his enemies are you done

670
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:42,816
What makes

671
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,376
That would be like

672
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:48,704
If someone came up to me and was like

673
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:50,752
Do you know who John Birch

674
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:54,848
Tell me about it

675
00:34:57,408 --> 00:35:01,760
Like I am I study Alex Jones who be insane for me to not know

676
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,808
Some of the spiritual precursors

677
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:06,880
Fights against the global

678
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,440
Do not know where

679
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:10,976
Like the ideas

680
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:13,536
Underlie eugenics

681
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:14,304
Come from

682
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:17,888
The birth of genetics

683
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:18,656
Concept

684
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:24,800
Mendelevium

685
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:25,568
Bingo

686
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:29,408
Also I will kick your ass and your family

687
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,480
Conor McGregor Mendes

688
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:33,504
Thank you very much

689
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:38,880
Before and after

690
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:41,184
One of my favorite song that was Helen of Troy Aikman

691
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,744
Strong work

692
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,512
Jeopardy

693
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:49,376
Who launched a thousand ships

694
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:51,936
So I thought this caller's voice was

695
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:52,960
Familiar to

696
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:54,496
But I couldn't quite place

697
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:56,032
Until he said

698
00:35:57,312 --> 00:36:01,408
I myself am a Pioneer research scientist Gregor Mendel

699
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:06,272
The GMOs

700
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,160
Realize

701
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:18,560
So Isaac near research where we heard that before

702
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:25,984
He called in on the January 8th from my when you called then when Mike Adams with Coho

703
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,776
Hosting the show

704
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,640
Doctor Winfield I just want to say it's really a pleasure sir

705
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:34,688
Be talking to you

706
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:41,088
I myself actually I'm one of America's few remaining Pioneer research scientist

707
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:47,488
I have no idea what that means I tried to look into it too

708
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:50,560
Is some sort of a real designation something

709
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:53,120
It's not it's just a general term

710
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:54,144
I don't know

711
00:36:54,400 --> 00:37:00,544
I love it I love I love the idea with listening to the show

712
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:05,152
Cast of peripheral characters keep calling in

713
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:09,248
Old man house phone

714
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:11,552
Erase the sky

715
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:15,136
It really indicates to me that the pool of colors is

716
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:16,416
Much smaller

717
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:17,696
Then it appears

718
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:18,976
There's just a lot of people that you

719
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:20,000
You kind of forget

720
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:21,280
For people who aren't they

721
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:22,048
Distinctive enough

722
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:23,072
In their nonsense

723
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:26,656
That you is that guy didn't say I'm a Pioneer sign

724
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:29,472
Dentist right I wouldn't remember that he called in

725
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:31,008
A month previous

726
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:33,824
Because you know what you can't ever forget

727
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:37,408
Somebody's mouth

728
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:40,992
Yeah I think it was an avalanche

729
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:47,648
Frontier psychiatrist

730
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:53,024
A researcher at Frontier psychiatrist

731
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:57,376
I don't know I don't know

732
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:58,400
That's what it means

733
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:00,448
Fireside get this crazy on the Coco

734
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:04,544
Maybe

735
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,872
One of the focuses that I'm going to have moving forward is like

736
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:10,176
Really trying to keep track of these callers

737
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:12,736
I would love it if

738
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:14,016
Let's say this podcast

739
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,600
And I end up needing to find a new project

740
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:20,672
Right I think a great thing to do would be try and find some

741
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:21,440
Scholars

742
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:28,352
I would love to talk to the Pioneer scientist

743
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,520
I think old racist man is probably dead

744
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:39,360
I would like

745
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:40,896
Corey be tough to get ahold of

746
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:48,576
Seems like

747
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:53,696
I did try and find him but it's very difficult to Google Bible damn

748
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:59,840
If Daniel is a book in the Bible

749
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:04,704
And Pioneer scientist

750
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:11,104
The back by itself

751
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,152
2013 in the field of genetics

752
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:16,224
Is a really good designation

753
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,248
Yeah yeah

754
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:20,064
He doesn't have much to say about the issue

755
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,368
Doesn't really understand how

756
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:23,392
We're just kind of moved on

757
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:27,744
We kind of expanded a little bit past Ike's

758
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,280
He's not interested

759
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:33,120
He's interested in

760
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:35,168
Pioneers

761
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:36,704
So

762
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:38,496
Dude here's what

763
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:40,800
Interesting about looking back at this stretch

764
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:41,568
Showtime

765
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:42,848
Like if I were just

766
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:43,872
To tell you earlier

767
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:44,640
2013

768
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:45,664
You would have

769
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,456
No idea what happened

770
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:49,504
Right

771
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,064
The World's End

772
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:52,832
That's early

773
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:55,904
Ensure

774
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:56,672
December

775
00:39:58,464 --> 00:39:59,232
Huge news

776
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:04,864
Go little bit further through and you know the doerner situation is that was a huge

777
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:06,912
And here's another one

778
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:08,960
I forgot happened probably

779
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:10,496
In February

780
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:11,264
2013

781
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:12,544
That is huge

782
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,824
This was

783
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:24,832
Awakening transmission

784
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:35,584
Going on

785
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:36,864
I mean

786
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:40,704
We don't really know how often

787
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:42,240
Get the yard

788
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:47,104
Few hours ago

789
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:51,456
Prisonplanet.com

790
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:56,320
Large asteroid

791
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:58,112
Tear

792
00:40:58,368 --> 00:41:01,184
Because

793
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:09,120
Waves

794
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:12,192
Different job

795
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:13,728
Sound barriers

796
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,544
Broken

797
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:19,616
Absolutely

798
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,832
Larger question is

799
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:32,928
Part of a spur

800
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:38,560
Because watch movie Armageddon

801
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:45,984
So what's going on

802
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:50,336
Do you remember this this was the is this one in Russia

803
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:52,895
Oh this is a difference

804
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:58,527
Meteor asteroid

805
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:01,855
Government saying

806
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:06,463
Uno's

807
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:10,303
15 million

808
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:11,839
It was very close

809
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:15,679
Relatively but it wasn't

810
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:21,823
What is near Earth object about how much

811
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:23,615
To his credit

812
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:24,639
Absol this point

813
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:25,407
Has been

814
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:26,687
Pretty on the side of

815
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:28,223
Nothing to worry about

816
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:32,319
The government are liars but don't worry about it isn't going to hit

817
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:34,111
Now on the 15th

818
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:36,415
Another object

819
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:37,951
Flew over Russia

820
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:43,071
Videos of it it's pretty

821
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:45,631
Pretty amazing

822
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:47,167
Piece of a meteor

823
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:51,263
And actually made it through the atmosphere

824
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:53,311
Kill anybody

825
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:54,335
But it did end up

826
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:55,615
Injuring like 1,000

827
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:57,407
People in town in Russia

828
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:58,687
And so

829
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:01,503
Because it happened on the same day

830
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:03,039
That this other

831
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:04,575
Near-earth object

832
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:10,975
Was going to make its closest pass okay Alex has combined

833
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:12,255
I've been saying

834
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:17,375
That it's not going to hit us but maybe it is

835
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:19,679
Can cover or what's it what's his

836
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:21,215
Prescription for

837
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:22,751
Not getting murdered

838
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:27,103
It's really weird because it's been really like Nan

839
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:29,407
Sensational just like

840
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:30,431
You're the closest

841
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:32,479
Something's ever come but it's nothing to be

842
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:33,503
Be concerned about

843
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:34,271
And I was like

844
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:35,295
This is how

845
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:36,063
Happened

846
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:36,831
In Russia

847
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:38,111
What is it

848
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:39,391
What's it going to be

849
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:42,207
Is easy going to go Y2K on us

850
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:43,999
What's the

851
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:45,279
I wasn't sure

852
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:47,327
It's interesting to see

853
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,607
See how this develops

854
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:49,631
Because it's

855
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:51,423
Irresponsible I would say

856
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:55,775
Shrikes

857
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:58,079
Thanks a million years or so

858
00:43:58,335 --> 00:44:01,919
Large asteroid

859
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:03,711
Extinction

860
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:28,031
Nope

861
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:34,687
Large stone blocks

862
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:49,535
Who this so much

863
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:51,583
It's a problem there

864
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:53,119
Other meteor strike

865
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:56,703
People of uncover

866
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:58,239
Less common than it is

867
00:44:58,751 --> 00:44:59,263
But it's

868
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:00,287
You know it happened

869
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:03,103
Right I've actually

870
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:08,223
So many little tiny things that fall all over the place

871
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:11,295
Because no damage no one even notices like

872
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:13,343
Little miniscule things

873
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:18,463
Basically

874
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:23,583
What he's doing is turning black nose

875
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:30,239
Never happen

876
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:33,311
Atlantis used to be around

877
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:34,847
Yeah yeah

878
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:37,663
That doesn't make any sense

879
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:41,247
Is that is that

880
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:45,599
If like 1/100 of it

881
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:46,623
Fall into Earth

882
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:47,903
We would all event

883
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:50,463
The entire Earth would have been

884
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:51,231
Just

885
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:52,255
Destroyed completely

886
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:55,583
Nuclear

887
00:45:58,143 --> 00:45:58,655
Game Change

888
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:02,495
Right but I mean that's no good for selling

889
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:05,055
Bible food it's too late if you're already on the same day

890
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:09,663
But it does help to

891
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:10,687
Even if

892
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:14,271
It does help to

893
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:16,319
Just create that feeling

894
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:17,087
Yeah

895
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:17,855
I can do that

896
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:22,463
I would say that it's kind of erroneous

897
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:23,743
To say the Play-Doh was a

898
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:25,279
Historian

899
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:30,911
Is Pliny the Elder Oliver

900
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:32,191
Josephus

901
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:34,495
There's some historians you can

902
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:35,775
Good bullfrog

903
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:36,799
Be comfortable calling

904
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:37,823
Play-Doh

905
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:38,591
Historian

906
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:40,383
Sure he's a storical figure

907
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:42,943
And also I mean we go over this all the time

908
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:45,759
Something I really enjoy

909
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:48,063
Play-Doh didn't discuss it as if it was,

910
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:51,647
If anything is presented in

911
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:52,927
Dialogues

912
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:53,695
Prettiest

913
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:55,999
Emmaus

914
00:46:57,535 --> 00:47:02,911
Secret information grandfather after so long

915
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:04,191
Went to Egypt

916
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:06,495
The elders there who told him about it

917
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:11,103
So if Alex Jones

918
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:11,871
Bright

919
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:17,247
This next B2 think is where it starts

920
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:18,783
Beer from

921
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:20,575
Insinuation

922
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:21,599
Towards

923
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:23,391
Little sensation

924
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:24,671
A little more than I wanted

925
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:31,839
Frost the closest to any asteroid

926
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:46,175
Eastern Standard Time Eastern

927
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:52,575
Closest to the earth

928
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:55,903
Recorded

929
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:05,887
Enter Raleigh for 5 hours

930
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:09,215
Prisonplanet.com

931
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:11,775
Absolutely

932
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:18,175
Drudgereport.com it also has about 015 story

933
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:26,111
We're reporting on

934
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:31,231
Down a meteor coming

935
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:33,023
Thousand plus miles an hour

936
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:37,887
So what's interesting about that is that Alex is reporting on

937
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:43,263
Theories floating around that Russia shot it down but that theory is posted on his website

938
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:50,175
Him saying I don't believe that Russia shot down

939
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:54,783
Brother f****** story on your website about the theory floating around that it

940
00:48:55,039 --> 00:49:01,183
Paul Joseph Watson has a theory that

941
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:07,583
No Joseph Watson story was about other people having theories that Russia shot down

942
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:09,375
But if you believe that's crazy

943
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:11,423
Don't write about

944
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:17,823
Everybody wants a good story

945
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:19,871
Little people

946
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:26,271
People are reporting all this Rush

947
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:28,319
I want to say something like what's Fox News where it's like

948
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:29,343
Oh

949
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:32,159
Does something dumb and then the next day they're like

950
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:36,767
People are saying

951
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:37,535
Specifically

952
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:38,559
He doesn't believe

953
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:46,495
No

954
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:48,287
So that is

955
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:49,311
That doesn't even

956
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:51,103
Motivation

957
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:59,295
You just need a better editorial on your website so you don't have bulshit you disagree

958
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:00,063
Probably

959
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:00,831
Whatever

960
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:07,487
Anyway in the next clip he's not saying it's going to

961
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:12,351
Ga-14

962
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:15,423
Caulfield

963
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:42,815
Bedtime

964
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:55,615
Asteroid

965
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:01,503
Countdown

966
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:09,439
24 Eastern Standard Time or Central

967
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:11,743
Are we doing this

968
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:16,095
1024

969
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:22,495
Around the world

970
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:26,591
We know that

971
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:35,039
When the computers remove

972
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:40,671
Craters

973
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:53,727
Also

974
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:56,287
That just gives up

975
00:51:56,543 --> 00:51:57,311
And if you notice

976
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:59,103
That's during his show

977
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:01,407
He has to be on air when that happen

978
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:03,711
So he's pretty excited

979
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:08,319
Kind of about building that up

980
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:12,415
There isn't an awareness of like I will be on air when

981
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:13,183
This

982
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:13,951
Yeah

983
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:15,999
He doesn't want to say

984
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:19,071
But he also doesn't want you to think

985
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:20,095
It's totally safe

986
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:21,631
Because then there's no tension

987
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:25,471
There's no presentation snow performance it's just

988
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:26,239
The story of like

989
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:29,567
Hey is Big Thing flying over there

990
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:31,871
The sky

991
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:34,687
Keep eyes on the product

992
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:35,711
So

993
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:36,991
You know

994
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:38,271
You got a resort

995
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:41,343
To insinuation you got to resort to

996
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:43,135
Irresponsible conjecture

997
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:44,415
This is where I

998
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:45,439
It reaches its

999
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:46,463
Natural

1000
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:51,327
Just a little piece

1001
00:52:56,703 --> 00:52:58,239
Imagine something

1002
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:07,455
14

1003
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:13,343
Mariah

1004
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:16,415
Or Chicago

1005
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:20,255
Or New York or Tokyo or Peking

1006
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:24,863
Or just just

1007
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:26,655
Thousands of people

1008
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:27,679
Confirm

1009
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:35,103
User was an asteroid coming

1010
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:37,663
Don't worry about it

1011
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:39,967
It should begin

1012
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:41,247
So

1013
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:45,855
Presenting some area where it's like I don't think is going to happen

1014
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:56,863
Everything would be happening just like

1015
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:03,263
What is the government until May

1016
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:04,543
I don't know what the rates

1017
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:05,311
To do is

1018
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:08,127
Here's all I know

1019
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:09,407
Whatever Alex is doing

1020
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:14,015
The position of this isn't going to happen

1021
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:14,783
Foot planting

1022
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:16,575
Seed of like a government

1023
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:20,671
If that situation

1024
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:22,975
The meteor was about to hit

1025
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:24,511
Your experience

1026
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:26,815
Just what you're feeling right now

1027
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:28,351
The government

1028
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:31,679
To you and your death warrant is a couple hours away

1029
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:37,055
Asteroid coming close

1030
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:43,711
So you don't know

1031
00:54:57,791 --> 00:55:01,375
Asteroid

1032
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:03,167
Is just irresponsible conjecture

1033
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:04,703
Really deeply

1034
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:05,471
You f***** up

1035
00:55:05,727 --> 00:55:06,495
His

1036
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:09,823
He has a responsibility as somebody who has an audience

1037
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:11,103
I'm too

1038
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:12,383
Coming with facts

1039
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:15,199
Write the common with a position of

1040
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:16,991
Having an awareness about the

1041
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:18,015
The situation not

1042
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:19,551
Some sort of a paranoid

1043
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:22,879
Combative missed towards

1044
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:25,695
Expert

1045
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:29,279
All you can do with this line of rhetoric is cause people

1046
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:31,583
The freak out that's the only thing it does

1047
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:34,143
He knows he knows

1048
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:35,935
Full

1049
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:47,455
Blisters believe that s*** for sure

1050
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:49,759
It's just causing them to live in a constant

1051
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:50,783
Speed of light

1052
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:55,903
Anxiety feel distrust

1053
00:55:57,183 --> 00:55:57,951
Yeah if he believed

1054
00:55:58,463 --> 00:56:00,255
Second but a meteor was going to hit the Earth

1055
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:05,119
He would not be on are you be with his family in a bunker or something

1056
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:07,167
If you believe

1057
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:08,447
Anything you're saying

1058
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:12,031
Even close to this like there's a chance cuz the government right

1059
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:13,311
Your behavior would be

1060
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:14,335
Completely.

1061
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:16,639
I think I would have treated like the eclipse

1062
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:18,943
Remember that

1063
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:20,991
Okay

1064
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:23,551
Going to go anyways

1065
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:28,159
Warming is a little different than the eclipse visual

1066
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:29,183
Certain death

1067
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:31,743
Right

1068
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:34,815
Eclipse

1069
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:36,607
Fly

1070
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:38,911
It was next clip Alex

1071
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:45,311
But that doesn't mean that something really bad isn't still going to happen

1072
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:55,807
Narrative

1073
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:07,327
Swag series

1074
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:11,167
The f****** asteroid fall swag great

1075
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:16,799
I just got out of that trailer thought before you started playing the clip I was like

1076
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:19,615
I wonder if he's going to say something like

1077
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:23,967
The government's going to fake it stroyd hitting you and that's why they're doing next

1078
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:28,575
God dammit

1079
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:32,671
If you want to start being able to predict where is Meredith's going

1080
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:36,255
Send it

1081
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:38,047
Okay

1082
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:40,863
So nothing is going to happen but if something does happen

1083
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:45,215
Probably the globalist actual asteroid

1084
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:48,031
I don't know our trying to explain to you that

1085
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:50,847
Asteroid hits happened much more than you

1086
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:51,615
Could happen

1087
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:54,175
F*** you man

1088
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:58,271
The fear and anxiety paranoid

1089
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:02,111
Disjointed

1090
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:04,415
This isn't even like a coherent position

1091
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:05,695
Know what are you saying

1092
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:07,487
Literally anything can happen

1093
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:08,255
But

1094
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:11,071
These are the things you should be afraid of

1095
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:11,839
Happened

1096
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:15,167
Is the government acting in good faith

1097
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:21,567
All other things are entirely possible how ridiculous they are

1098
00:58:21,823 --> 00:58:24,383
Turn off a nuke and somehow people would believe it was

1099
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:26,175
A f****** asteroid hitting

1100
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:28,991
Different things that happened but those things

1101
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:29,759
Nope

1102
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:32,319
Get the f*** out of here

1103
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:34,879
So in this next clip Alex

1104
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:36,415
Consulting

1105
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:37,695
Al Gore

1106
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:38,719
Which is fine

1107
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:06,367
This is one of

1108
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:09,183
Two times that he calls Al Gore Fat Bastard

1109
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:09,951
Trump

1110
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:15,071
Austin Powers

1111
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:17,887
Austin Powers references in 2013

1112
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:22,495
Get in my belly

1113
00:59:22,751 --> 00:59:24,799
References

1114
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:27,615
Fresh

1115
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:28,383
Fresh

1116
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:30,943
Certainly everyone knows

1117
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:36,063
Like a Markham markable similarity visually between Al Gore

1118
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:37,855
And fat faster

1119
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:42,719
Looking at that

1120
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:46,047
Hey Al Gore with red hair with a mediately go to

1121
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:50,143
Really actually

1122
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:51,423
Fatboy Vapors

1123
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:55,263
Really pissed off at Alex didn't do a getting my belly really

1124
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:58,079
Good impression

1125
00:59:59,103 --> 01:00:00,639
How do you resist

1126
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:06,527
The fat Believers pression

1127
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:11,647
I refuse to acknowledge that accent

1128
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:12,415
Because he

1129
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:15,743
Max microfiber is

1130
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:16,511
It's grandfather and I

1131
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:22,655
I only go with his hair his head is the size of an orange

1132
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:23,423
That's what I do

1133
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:24,447
So Alex

1134
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:25,727
At this point starts taking

1135
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:26,495
Calls

1136
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:29,567
This is great

1137
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:30,847
This is just Alex

1138
01:00:31,103 --> 01:00:32,127
Complete dick to a guy

1139
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:34,943
Who didn't realize that Alex had gone to his call

1140
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:37,503
Polish Behavior

1141
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:40,063
That I would love out of anybody who's not out

1142
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:44,415
How are you

1143
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:49,535
Am I on the internet

1144
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:10,015
Is it pointless

1145
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:16,415
Is exactly the kind of behavior I Love don't love line Adam Carolla

1146
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:21,791
I'm stuck taking calls for these people

1147
01:01:22,047 --> 01:01:26,143
You do a call-in show there's those hiccups

1148
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:26,911
What's the weather like

1149
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:30,239
This really disrupts the flow of Jairo

1150
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:33,055
But I just don't appreciate it it's

1151
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:37,919
Morrison's yearly angry

1152
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:38,943
Perhaps

1153
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:42,783
After joke around because

1154
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:44,575
Instead of getting angry

1155
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:47,135
I feel a deep Anger from you

1156
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:53,535
No that's what I mean when I say cruel I don't mean the action is cruel is not it's not humor

1157
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:56,607
It is like I'm trying to hurt this

1158
01:01:56,863 --> 01:01:57,631
I want them to

1159
01:01:57,887 --> 01:01:58,399
To feel pain

1160
01:01:58,655 --> 01:01:59,167
Yeah

1161
01:01:59,423 --> 01:01:59,935
Subway

1162
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:06,079
I'm through much more like

1163
01:02:06,847 --> 01:02:09,407
Crazy

1164
01:02:09,663 --> 01:02:12,479
We're doing this overnight radio show and

1165
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:15,551
It seemed more like trying to

1166
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:16,319
Entertain

1167
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:17,855
Selves

1168
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:21,695
Like more of a Mystery Science Theater fuel to a Alex's

1169
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:25,791
While he's taking

1170
01:02:26,047 --> 01:02:26,559
Some calls

1171
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:29,887
Went to Piers Morgan

1172
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:32,191
Azan

1173
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:35,263
Afterwards

1174
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:37,823
Alex got

1175
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:39,103
A Morgan show

1176
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:41,919
A bissinger one of Piers Morgan

1177
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:47,039
And then after that

1178
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:50,367
I was confronted Piers Morgan at a gun shop in Texas

1179
01:02:50,879 --> 01:02:52,159
And Alex start stalking

1180
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:58,559
Think about this and in the middle of talking about it realizes that he forgot

1181
01:02:59,071 --> 01:03:00,607
Which I didn't even realize

1182
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:01,631
That's a big problem

1183
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:11,615
Piers Morgan

1184
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:13,151
Surprising

1185
01:03:13,663 --> 01:03:15,711
Texas

1186
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:26,207
Let me surprise

1187
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:28,511
You really should have brought that up

1188
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:30,815
Yeah I agree with you you should have

1189
01:03:31,071 --> 01:03:37,215
I think you just kept begging to come back on the show

1190
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:38,239
Are for Alex

1191
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:41,055
Buzz bissinger threatened to kill you

1192
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:44,895
Not even a little bit

1193
01:03:45,151 --> 01:03:49,759
Complaints about remember the the brief moment of sympathy

1194
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:50,783
Circumstance

1195
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:53,087
Salad

1196
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:55,135
The thing to point out

1197
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:55,903
Show settings

1198
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:00,767
Trillium

1199
01:04:01,023 --> 01:04:03,071
Like really brings home but like that is

1200
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:06,143
Not with Alex cares about you only cares about that

1201
01:04:06,399 --> 01:04:06,911
Insomuch as it

1202
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:07,679
Gibson point

1203
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:11,263
Actually had Piers Morgan in front of him

1204
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:14,079
If you the first thing she brought up

1205
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:15,615
And you don't have to be like

1206
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:16,383
A dick

1207
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:17,919
To him to bring it up

1208
01:04:18,175 --> 01:04:20,479
I understand that we have a difference

1209
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:22,271
Perspective

1210
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:25,087
Gaston your show said he wanted to

1211
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:26,879
Shoot me and you were fine

1212
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:29,439
Talk about how

1213
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:30,719
Saying that is

1214
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:34,559
You can do that in the polite way you don't have to yell at him to bring that up

1215
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:38,911
This is days weeks later

1216
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:41,215
From when it confronted

1217
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:43,263
A Texas gun shop

1218
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:45,055
Realizing

1219
01:04:47,103 --> 01:04:49,919
Well I think he's also thinking that that would have been a

1220
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:51,455
Better strategy

1221
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:52,479
To try and get back on

1222
01:04:52,735 --> 01:04:55,295
On the show like if he confronts.

1223
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:58,623
Dislike

1224
01:04:58,879 --> 01:05:05,023
Pilloried for saying stuff like that

1225
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:06,303
Have you come on the show to talk about

1226
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:11,167
Maybe that's what Alex is better approach

1227
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:12,191
Yep

1228
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:17,055
So if Alex gets another call

1229
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:18,591
Is like

1230
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:19,359
He's on one

1231
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:21,407
He's talking about how

1232
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:23,199
Somebody

1233
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:26,015
Accused him of threatening to shoot

1234
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:27,551
Shoot up a school

1235
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:29,599
And then he went to LA and had a beauty

1236
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:30,623
George Noory

1237
01:05:30,879 --> 01:05:34,463
He got arrested he was in prison and he was

1238
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:35,743
Get people to help him

1239
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:36,767
His story makes

1240
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:38,303
No sense all right

1241
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:39,327
I like

1242
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:41,375
So you want some help from Alex

1243
01:05:42,399 --> 01:05:48,543
It's very complicated and I like I'm almost ready to try Microsoft one of your investigators and show him my dog

1244
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:07,231
Help somebody

1245
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:10,303
But

1246
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:14,655
California

1247
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:21,823
Also I don't I don't

1248
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:23,359
Think that he was wrong and

1249
01:06:24,383 --> 01:06:25,919
Take on that dude's

1250
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:28,479
K spray 30 lb of

1251
01:06:28,991 --> 01:06:30,527
We have pounds of

1252
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:34,367
I got red flags

1253
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:38,463
Obviously probably not polite to be like hey hey buddy

1254
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:39,743
You're crazy

1255
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:43,071
So baby is responses fine but

1256
01:06:43,327 --> 01:06:46,143
I think it underlies like a a real like I don't trust

1257
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:46,911
My own audio

1258
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:53,567
I'm not going to help you write about most

1259
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:59,455
I know the government suppressing all of us and I'm going to help in the only way I can

1260
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:00,223
Which is

1261
01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:00,991
Yelling

1262
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:04,575
Making you scared of a meteor

1263
01:07:04,831 --> 01:07:05,599
That's what I was

1264
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:06,367
I was just

1265
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:10,463
Hearing there is the underlying truth behind those like

1266
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:13,279
The meteors coming or you can't trust the government or anything

1267
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:14,047
Like that

1268
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:18,399
I am going to saddle you with his many fears and problems is

1269
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:19,167
As I can

1270
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:20,703
And I

1271
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:22,239
Can't do anything

1272
01:07:22,495 --> 01:07:23,007
Positive

1273
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:25,311
0 positive action

1274
01:07:26,591 --> 01:07:30,431
Should I yes nurse started organization could help you positive

1275
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:33,503
No positive Act

1276
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:34,783
Whatsoever

1277
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:37,599
Skip another gas

1278
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:39,391
You have guests here on the 15th

1279
01:07:39,647 --> 01:07:40,927
This woman

1280
01:07:41,439 --> 01:07:42,207
Remember her name cuz she

1281
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:42,975
She's gone by

1282
01:07:43,743 --> 01:07:44,255
Just a single

1283
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:47,583
She's a nurse

1284
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:49,119
No

1285
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:50,655
She's a nurse

1286
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:53,215
Had called in previously

1287
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:54,495
Two whistleblower

1288
01:07:55,007 --> 01:07:56,543
About the military

1289
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:57,311
Giving

1290
01:07:57,567 --> 01:07:58,591
Soldiers mad

1291
01:07:59,615 --> 01:08:00,127
Scandalous

1292
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:00,895
Stop

1293
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:05,247
Open interview that's basically all just anti-science

1294
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:07,039
Psych meds

1295
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:09,599
I don't really care about most of things

1296
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:11,135
She think because she says a couple

1297
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:11,903
Things that are

1298
01:08:12,415 --> 01:08:13,695
Markedly

1299
01:08:14,207 --> 01:08:15,487
Literally disqualified

1300
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:17,023
And here's the first

1301
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:24,191
They have these problems with

1302
01:08:25,983 --> 01:08:27,519
PCP angel dust

1303
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:32,895
Legitimate

1304
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:39,295
Amnesia

1305
01:08:49,023 --> 01:08:52,863
Good illustrative moment about how unreliable Alex Jones

1306
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:53,631
Supposed whistle

1307
01:08:54,911 --> 01:08:58,239
He has this nurse on who blown the whistle about dangerous psych meds

1308
01:08:58,495 --> 01:09:00,799
Sincerely and on ironically is arguing

1309
01:09:01,567 --> 01:09:02,079
P and ketamine

1310
01:09:02,591 --> 01:09:03,871
Are basically the same thing

1311
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:05,919
And now they only came out with ketamine

1312
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:07,711
Watch baggage

1313
01:09:07,967 --> 01:09:08,991
But the evil doctors

1314
01:09:09,247 --> 01:09:09,759
Still wanted

1315
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:11,039
The f*** people up

1316
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:19,487
The first problem is that while the chemical underlined piece

1317
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:21,023
He was fairly popular likes

1318
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:23,839
70 years ago it's been outlawed for medical uses

1319
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:24,607
19 6

1320
01:09:24,863 --> 01:09:25,375
65

1321
01:09:25,887 --> 01:09:28,703
Would be approved for human use 5 years later

1322
01:09:28,959 --> 01:09:31,007
Absurd status wasn't response

1323
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:32,799
PCP falling out of favor

1324
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:37,407
Just because Something's Happened around the same time in a chronological

1325
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:43,295
Doesn't mean that the prior thing caused the letter thing

1326
01:09:44,575 --> 01:09:45,855
Also

1327
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:48,671
Ketamine are not one molecule offer

1328
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:50,975
From each other they're very different substance

1329
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:52,511
Because very different effects

1330
01:09:53,535 --> 01:09:55,327
They both have been used as anesthetics

1331
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:56,095
At some point

1332
01:09:56,351 --> 01:09:56,863
History

1333
01:09:57,119 --> 01:09:58,143
So it's easy to take

1334
01:09:58,399 --> 01:09:59,679
Surface-level approach

1335
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:00,959
Simpler

1336
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:04,031
Uninformed position

1337
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:09,407
The chemical makeup of PCP or phencyclidine is

1338
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:11,711
25

1339
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:18,623
Conversely ketamine is c-13 H

1340
01:10:19,135 --> 01:10:20,671
DLNA

1341
01:10:22,207 --> 01:10:25,791
So it's really clear just want a basic very different compound

1342
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:27,071
41

1343
01:10:27,327 --> 01:10:30,143
With ketamine you have nine Less hydrogen's in

1344
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:31,679
That's going to affect

1345
01:10:31,935 --> 01:10:33,471
The structure of things pretty considerably

1346
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:37,567
Not even taking into account but now you've added in oxygen and chlorine

1347
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:39,359
These are very different Subs

1348
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:42,431
Disqualifying

1349
01:10:42,687 --> 01:10:43,455
Say what you say

1350
01:10:43,711 --> 01:10:45,247
It indicates that she's either

1351
01:10:45,503 --> 01:10:46,527
Not actually a nurse

1352
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:47,551
Where she is

1353
01:10:47,807 --> 01:10:48,575
She doesn't know which

1354
01:10:48,831 --> 01:10:49,599
She's talkin about

1355
01:10:49,855 --> 01:10:50,879
It just trying to use her

1356
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:51,903
Supposed professional

1357
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:52,671
Credentials

1358
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:54,463
To strengthen her misguided

1359
01:10:54,975 --> 01:10:55,487
Science

1360
01:10:56,255 --> 01:10:59,071
Which is what you'd expect from Alex Jones whistleblower

1361
01:10:59,327 --> 01:10:59,839
Still kind of think

1362
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:01,631
I'm a

1363
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:03,679
Five be wrong about

1364
01:11:04,191 --> 01:11:05,983
But what you described are the

1365
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:06,751
The chemical,

1366
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:08,287
For a mullet

1367
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:09,823
Correct

1368
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:11,359
Like so

1369
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:12,383
C9

1370
01:11:12,639 --> 01:11:13,407
And whatever it was

1371
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:16,479
Is Amala

1372
01:11:17,247 --> 01:11:23,391
So they cannot add or subtract of molecules from the bottom

1373
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:28,255
What you say

1374
01:11:28,511 --> 01:11:30,815
URI are equipped

1375
01:11:31,071 --> 01:11:32,095
Speak about it

1376
01:11:32,351 --> 01:11:36,959
Alter the chemical compound

1377
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:37,983
Slightly

1378
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:42,079
You make Academy

1379
01:11:44,639 --> 01:11:45,407
If you look at

1380
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:48,223
To each other to the structure

1381
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:49,247
Completely different

1382
01:11:49,759 --> 01:11:50,527
There's no way

1383
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:52,063
It's not

1384
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:54,367
Either of them

1385
01:11:55,647 --> 01:11:56,927
Here's the next

1386
01:11:57,439 --> 01:11:57,951
She says

1387
01:11:58,207 --> 01:11:58,719
Disqualifying

1388
01:12:12,031 --> 01:12:12,543
So are you

1389
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:14,335
So Sigmund Freud

1390
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:15,103
The father is

1391
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:15,871
Psychiatry

1392
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:17,663
He's the father of psychoanalysis

1393
01:12:18,687 --> 01:12:20,479
The very different

1394
01:12:20,735 --> 01:12:21,503
Care about being accurate

1395
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:25,343
Troy Pioneer new ideas but the interplay of the human in

1396
01:12:25,599 --> 01:12:27,135
Society underlying processes

1397
01:12:27,391 --> 01:12:28,159
Inside the brain

1398
01:12:28,415 --> 01:12:29,951
We believe that through analysis

1399
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:30,719
Talking things

1400
01:12:30,975 --> 01:12:32,255
Through one could learn about how the

1401
01:12:32,511 --> 01:12:33,023
The two interact

1402
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:33,791
Each other

1403
01:12:34,303 --> 01:12:36,607
He was specifically and emphatically opposed

1404
01:12:36,863 --> 01:12:38,143
Returning the process of analysis

1405
01:12:39,935 --> 01:12:40,703
I did not advocate

1406
01:12:41,215 --> 01:12:41,727
Use the medication

1407
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:42,495
Dyspraxia

1408
01:12:43,007 --> 01:12:45,055
Moreover he was supposed to look at

1409
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:47,103
Psychological issues as illnesses

1410
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:48,383
That needed to be treated

1411
01:12:48,639 --> 01:12:50,175
And advances you that's closer

1412
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:56,063
Cinema is going on in our head they could be made less troubling by self-awareness and understanding them

1413
01:12:56,575 --> 01:12:58,623
Basically his whole thing was like the

1414
01:12:59,135 --> 01:13:01,695
This psychoanalysis allows you to find the ways

1415
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:02,975
You lie to yourself

1416
01:13:03,487 --> 01:13:04,767
And damaging ways

1417
01:13:05,023 --> 01:13:06,047
Resolve those issues

1418
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:09,119
Do we have no idea which

1419
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:09,887
She's talking about

1420
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:11,679
BP is ketamine

1421
01:13:11,935 --> 01:13:13,215
And if Freud is a

1422
01:13:13,983 --> 01:13:17,055
Any interview or what just blindly and embarrassingly Def

1423
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:18,847
To justify the point

1424
01:13:19,359 --> 01:13:20,383
That meds are evil

1425
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:24,735
Booty Shottas interview

1426
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:25,759
She's presenting herself

1427
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:26,783
To be an expert in

1428
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:28,575
This is like embarrassing

1429
01:13:28,831 --> 01:13:29,343
For Alex

1430
01:13:29,599 --> 01:13:30,623
Biotics

1431
01:13:31,135 --> 01:13:31,903
But he's not

1432
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:33,439
Hold on now

1433
01:13:33,695 --> 01:13:35,743
Freud is the father of psychiatry

1434
01:13:36,511 --> 01:13:37,023
Who u s

1435
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:38,303
You're telling me that piece

1436
01:13:38,815 --> 01:13:39,583
He is ketamine

1437
01:13:40,095 --> 01:13:42,399
Instead

1438
01:13:43,423 --> 01:13:47,775
Nobody's talking

1439
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:48,543
Initial

1440
01:13:49,311 --> 01:13:49,823
Crazy

1441
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:51,871
So

1442
01:13:52,639 --> 01:13:53,151
That should make

1443
01:13:53,407 --> 01:13:54,175
This

1444
01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:55,455
Text clippy a little easier.

1445
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:56,991
Cuz

1446
01:13:57,247 --> 01:13:57,759
Alex's

1447
01:13:58,015 --> 01:13:58,527
Planing

1448
01:13:58,783 --> 01:14:00,063
About how everyone is

1449
01:14:00,575 --> 01:14:01,087
Suggestible

1450
01:14:01,599 --> 01:14:02,623
I want to suggest

1451
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:04,671
All everyone in the population

1452
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:05,951
They're all just sheep

1453
01:14:06,463 --> 01:14:06,975
You could just

1454
01:14:07,231 --> 01:14:07,743
Tell them

1455
01:14:07,999 --> 01:14:14,143
Tell them something they believe it's a true

1456
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:15,167
Complain

1457
01:14:15,423 --> 01:14:16,191
Is interesting

1458
01:14:16,447 --> 01:14:17,727
Because what he uses to do

1459
01:14:17,983 --> 01:14:18,495
Defend

1460
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:19,775
His assertion

1461
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:21,567
That the human population is

1462
01:14:21,823 --> 01:14:24,639
Suggestible

1463
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:41,279
Show weak-minded

1464
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:51,263
Restaurant

1465
01:14:54,335 --> 01:14:55,359
You just fell over

1466
01:15:02,527 --> 01:15:05,343
Is that your employees are idiots

1467
01:15:05,855 --> 01:15:08,415
But you haven't demonstrated in any way that this

1468
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:10,207
Applies to the general population

1469
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:13,535
Are also I be willing to believe that this person was afraid of you

1470
01:15:16,863 --> 01:15:17,631
Kind of other

1471
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:18,911
Possible explanation

1472
01:15:19,167 --> 01:15:23,263
Employees Behavior

1473
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:26,335
What is Obi-Wan with kind of a petty prick

1474
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:29,919
It's not like trying to generalize

1475
01:15:30,431 --> 01:15:30,943
Results

1476
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:35,039
Single trial

1477
01:15:35,295 --> 01:15:38,367
I think I should just go out and harass people for no reason

1478
01:15:38,623 --> 01:15:39,391
Pretend it's a joke

1479
01:15:39,647 --> 01:15:41,183
Well now because he's addicted

1480
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:42,463
He starts by saying

1481
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:47,327
The public is so weak mind you can tell them they fell down and they'll believe you

1482
01:15:47,839 --> 01:15:48,607
One time

1483
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:50,399
I did that to a staff member

1484
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:53,215
You can't generalize that too

1485
01:15:53,471 --> 01:15:53,983
The population

1486
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:56,543
You have one experience than that

1487
01:15:56,799 --> 01:15:59,359
There's so many extraneous variables are you got it

1488
01:15:59,615 --> 01:16:05,759
Exclude power relations

1489
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:09,087
Not I will believe anything

1490
01:16:09,343 --> 01:16:10,879
Like how

1491
01:16:11,391 --> 01:16:12,415
Because inferences are

1492
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:14,463
Like he's either he's applying this one

1493
01:16:15,231 --> 01:16:15,999
Instant stew

1494
01:16:16,255 --> 01:16:17,023
Everyone

1495
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:20,351
Either that or he only hires people that

1496
01:16:20,863 --> 01:16:21,375
You can trick

1497
01:16:22,655 --> 01:16:25,215
That's an insult to everybody who works

1498
01:16:25,727 --> 01:16:27,263
As well maybe

1499
01:16:27,519 --> 01:16:28,799
We can take this

1500
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:29,567
Assume

1501
01:16:30,591 --> 01:16:31,103
Wow

1502
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:32,127
Who is

1503
01:16:32,383 --> 01:16:33,919
Gullible enough to believe that

1504
01:16:34,431 --> 01:16:34,943
CP of cat

1505
01:16:36,735 --> 01:16:38,271
Do Serta bulshit things

1506
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:39,807
Maybe it's staph

1507
01:16:40,063 --> 01:16:44,671
Yeah maybe they're also suggestible that it becomes a place where everyone believes

1508
01:16:44,927 --> 01:16:47,487
All the stupid s*** that said on the show

1509
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:52,351
So it is next clip we get another thing that we always got to keep

1510
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:54,399
First of all colors

1511
01:16:54,911 --> 01:16:55,423
Second of all

1512
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:56,703
Alex's fecaliths

1513
01:16:57,471 --> 01:16:58,239
Third of all

1514
01:16:59,007 --> 01:17:00,287
Does Alex have feelings

1515
01:17:00,799 --> 01:17:01,567
That killing dogs

1516
01:17:08,735 --> 01:17:11,551
In my yard

1517
01:17:17,183 --> 01:17:19,231
I just saw the rabbit

1518
01:17:19,487 --> 01:17:20,255
Chihuahua

1519
01:17:32,543 --> 01:17:33,823
Got to shoot those new world orders

1520
01:17:34,079 --> 01:17:34,591
Damn

1521
01:17:36,383 --> 01:17:38,431
Stop talking about killing.

1522
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:40,479
Happens all the time

1523
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:50,463
Every time Alex pretty much the only time I've ever comes

1524
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:52,255
Stopping my life is taking a

1525
01:17:53,791 --> 01:17:54,815
Dogs

1526
01:17:56,095 --> 01:17:56,863
Sui preoccupation

1527
01:17:57,119 --> 01:17:57,631
Jesus

1528
01:17:57,887 --> 01:17:59,167
I wonder I wonder what that means

1529
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:03,263
Alex has another guy

1530
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:07,359
The guy who I'd never heard of before

1531
01:18:07,871 --> 01:18:08,639
But

1532
01:18:08,895 --> 01:18:09,407
Spec

1533
01:18:09,663 --> 01:18:10,175
Here is our

1534
01:18:30,143 --> 01:18:32,191
I had a little bit of a red flag

1535
01:18:32,447 --> 01:18:34,495
Since the last time Alex had a

1536
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:37,567
China expert on it was that guy was pretending

1537
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:39,359
To run a adoption

1538
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:45,759
Pagoda guide

1539
01:18:46,015 --> 01:18:46,783
I don't know if I trust

1540
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:50,111
Your ability to suss out who is is not a China at

1541
01:18:50,623 --> 01:18:55,743
I don't want you to look into this what kind of awfulness I open the lid

1542
01:18:56,511 --> 01:19:02,143
So on the surface Alex's gas to your Steve Moser is

1543
01:19:02,399 --> 01:19:02,911
Humane practices

1544
01:19:03,167 --> 01:19:03,935
Is the Chinese government

1545
01:19:04,703 --> 01:19:07,775
He's trying to lift the veil and make everyone aware the brutality that was

1546
01:19:08,031 --> 01:19:08,543
Complicit

1547
01:19:08,799 --> 01:19:10,335
And how the one child policy was an actor

1548
01:19:10,847 --> 01:19:12,127
And the falsehood that were

1549
01:19:12,383 --> 01:19:13,407
Behind the rationalization

1550
01:19:13,919 --> 01:19:14,431
Creation

1551
01:19:14,943 --> 01:19:16,223
Play squeezo position is

1552
01:19:16,735 --> 01:19:19,039
China created a false overpopulation

1553
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:20,063
Idea

1554
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:21,599
Like

1555
01:19:21,855 --> 01:19:23,135
To create oppressive

1556
01:19:23,647 --> 01:19:24,415
Population

1557
01:19:24,671 --> 01:19:25,183
Control measures

1558
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:26,975
Leatherface

1559
01:19:27,487 --> 01:19:29,535
But if you look a little deeper into Moser

1560
01:19:30,815 --> 01:19:32,095
Different sort of picture

1561
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:35,167
Possibly a guy who is

1562
01:19:36,447 --> 01:19:42,079
And uses China as a means of advancing his own agenda

1563
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:43,103
Anti-abortion

1564
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:49,247
So emotional he was the first American answer

1565
01:19:49,503 --> 01:19:50,271
Ecology research

1566
01:19:50,527 --> 01:19:52,063
Student to be allowed to go to China

1567
01:19:52,319 --> 01:19:53,343
Research purposes

1568
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:56,415
After the cultural revolution

1569
01:19:56,671 --> 01:19:58,463
Yes is one of the last

1570
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:02,303
He's one of the last his research resulted in him being not allowed back in China

1571
01:20:02,559 --> 01:20:04,607
Being expelled from Stanford

1572
01:20:04,863 --> 01:20:05,631
Before he completed

1573
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:10,495
His supporters argue that it is all punishment for his intrepid reporting

1574
01:20:11,007 --> 01:20:13,567
He released photographs of women having forced abortion

1575
01:20:13,824 --> 01:20:15,616
And the Chinese government was mad about

1576
01:20:15,872 --> 01:20:18,432
So they kicked him out of country and convince them for to expel

1577
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:20,224
That neatly fits

1578
01:20:20,736 --> 01:20:21,760
The antique china

1579
01:20:22,016 --> 01:20:25,856
Communist world you so pretty much anyone who cares about who Steven Mosher is

1580
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:27,648
Just accept that as the truth

1581
01:20:28,416 --> 01:20:28,928
However

1582
01:20:29,184 --> 01:20:32,512
The reality is that he was expelled because he released those photos of

1583
01:20:32,768 --> 01:20:34,304
With the subjects faces

1584
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:35,072
Exposed

1585
01:20:35,328 --> 01:20:37,120
Which is a really serious ethical breach

1586
01:20:37,888 --> 01:20:39,424
If you're doing investigative work

1587
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:40,192
Reporting to Deming

1588
01:20:40,448 --> 01:20:41,728
Evil of a government

1589
01:20:41,984 --> 01:20:42,496
And a big

1590
01:20:42,752 --> 01:20:43,520
Piece of your evidence is

1591
01:20:43,776 --> 01:20:44,288
Pictures of spy

1592
01:20:44,544 --> 01:20:46,080
Pacific citizens of that governments

1593
01:20:46,336 --> 01:20:48,896
Country being the victim of government oppression

1594
01:20:49,152 --> 01:20:51,712
You have a Paramount responsibility to

1595
01:20:51,968 --> 01:20:52,992
Protect those people's identity

1596
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:54,784
Stanford was shocked

1597
01:20:55,296 --> 01:20:56,576
Mosher wood published

1598
01:20:56,832 --> 01:20:58,880
These images with no regard for how he's doing so

1599
01:20:59,136 --> 01:21:00,416
Could put these women in danger

1600
01:21:00,928 --> 01:21:02,976
And after reviewing relevant ethical standards

1601
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:04,256
They kicked him out of the school

1602
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:07,328
This is not something a program

1603
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:11,168
The process of working for their pH

1604
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:13,472
The school has an investment in nursing

1605
01:21:14,496 --> 01:21:16,032
It's pretty serious violation

1606
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:18,080
Kicked out of a postgraduate program

1607
01:21:22,432 --> 01:21:23,968
It also looks bad for the program

1608
01:21:24,736 --> 01:21:27,296
If you're kicking out a bunch of post-grad candidates

1609
01:21:27,552 --> 01:21:29,344
It implies that you don't have good admissions

1610
01:21:30,112 --> 01:21:31,904
So School 10 to go out of their way to key

1611
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:33,184
Keep students in the program

1612
01:21:33,696 --> 01:21:36,000
Incorrect problems where they can be corrected

1613
01:21:36,512 --> 01:21:38,048
In the case of Mosher

1614
01:21:38,304 --> 01:21:40,096
Actions were beyond what could be except

1615
01:21:40,608 --> 01:21:42,400
And so they had to get rid of

1616
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:45,728
That's that should tell you a little bit about this guy

1617
01:21:48,544 --> 01:21:49,056
God

1618
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:50,080
Women disappear

1619
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:55,968
It's subjected them to such a high-risk

1620
01:21:56,224 --> 01:21:56,992
Retaliation

1621
01:21:57,248 --> 01:22:02,880
From that and he had every reason to know that he should have been more careful graduate student

1622
01:22:03,136 --> 01:22:06,208
Setting their ethical standards in place specifically

1623
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:07,232
Because

1624
01:22:07,488 --> 01:22:09,024
You could put a Target on

1625
01:22:12,608 --> 01:22:13,632
That did just that

1626
01:22:14,144 --> 01:22:15,936
Because of you

1627
01:22:16,192 --> 01:22:18,752
Fallout is much more difficult for research

1628
01:22:19,264 --> 01:22:20,544
Stu

1629
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:23,360
It caused a real serious backlash

1630
01:22:24,128 --> 01:22:26,432
Weather many good reasons to denounce

1631
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:27,200
Decry the practice

1632
01:22:27,712 --> 01:22:30,016
The Chinese government relation to its one-child policy

1633
01:22:30,528 --> 01:22:32,064
Hoosier seems to approach his criticism

1634
01:22:32,576 --> 01:22:33,344
A very weird angle

1635
01:22:34,112 --> 01:22:37,952
His argument is that they started the policy because of fears about overpopulation

1636
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:39,488
But that those fears were fake

1637
01:22:39,744 --> 01:22:41,536
And just a cover-up for their real reason

1638
01:22:41,792 --> 01:22:43,840
Try that they wanted to control the population

1639
01:22:44,608 --> 01:22:48,192
He then takes this implication that the Chinese government was lying about their motive

1640
01:22:48,448 --> 01:22:51,520
It applies to all family planning in birth

1641
01:22:51,776 --> 01:22:53,312
Control initiatives worldwide

1642
01:22:54,592 --> 01:22:56,640
This is really what Moser is all about

1643
01:22:57,152 --> 01:23:00,224
He's a devout Catholic who staunchly opposed to all family planning

1644
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:03,040
He runs an organization called the population research

1645
01:23:04,064 --> 01:23:05,600
Whose mission is to

1646
01:23:05,856 --> 01:23:08,160
Debunk the myth of overpopulation which

1647
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:12,512
Abusive population control program

1648
01:23:13,024 --> 01:23:16,096
And quote expose the Relentless promotion of abortion

1649
01:23:18,912 --> 01:23:19,424
Abortive

1650
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:22,496
That's it contraception

1651
01:23:22,752 --> 01:23:27,104
Sterilization in misleadingly labeled population

1652
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:28,640
And reproductive health

1653
01:23:30,176 --> 01:23:30,688
That's really what

1654
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:33,248
Motrin distance

1655
01:23:33,504 --> 01:23:34,784
You do not care about

1656
01:23:35,296 --> 01:23:37,600
Seriously complex issues of overpopulation

1657
01:23:38,368 --> 01:23:43,232
Serious researchers on the topic would agree with him that the issue isn't that there's too many people

1658
01:23:43,488 --> 01:23:45,280
It's been our resource allocation is

1659
01:23:46,048 --> 01:23:46,560
You f***** up

1660
01:23:46,816 --> 01:23:47,840
And then overpopulation is a

1661
01:23:48,096 --> 01:23:51,168
The serious issue when the vast majority of the people who exist are living

1662
01:23:51,424 --> 01:23:51,936
Poverty

1663
01:23:52,448 --> 01:23:53,472
Poverty is the problem

1664
01:23:53,984 --> 01:23:55,264
Not just the number of human

1665
01:23:55,776 --> 01:23:58,848
It'll be easier to take Motrin seriously if he cared about that

1666
01:23:59,104 --> 01:23:59,616
At all

1667
01:24:00,128 --> 01:24:00,640
But he does

1668
01:24:00,896 --> 01:24:03,456
Because his work is just a trojan horse to attack

1669
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:04,224
Contraception

1670
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:05,760
And all pro-choice

1671
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:08,320
But that's not all

1672
01:24:08,832 --> 01:24:10,624
He's also a big demography guy

1673
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:12,416
Great as hero quotes

1674
01:24:12,672 --> 01:24:15,744
The practice of abortion artificial birth control sterilization

1675
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,048
And a culture of secularism

1676
01:24:18,304 --> 01:24:19,584
Materialism

1677
01:24:20,096 --> 01:24:21,888
Country

1678
01:24:22,144 --> 01:24:22,656
Serious

1679
01:24:23,424 --> 01:24:24,448
Only god reigns

1680
01:24:24,704 --> 01:24:25,728
We must serve

1681
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:29,312
Because of the above we lack native-born children

1682
01:24:29,568 --> 01:24:33,664
And hence need immigration and Catholic families need children to replenish the church

1683
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:39,040
Give us Priestly and religious vocations

1684
01:24:41,344 --> 01:24:47,488
Our culture and survival is a prosperous Nation needs Young have more than two children

1685
01:24:47,744 --> 01:24:48,768
Glorious

1686
01:24:49,024 --> 01:24:49,536
Motherhood

1687
01:24:49,792 --> 01:24:53,376
A woman's fertility is our greatest treasure in the boardroom of business

1688
01:24:53,888 --> 01:24:54,400
Apologetic

1689
01:24:54,656 --> 01:24:55,168
Boy

1690
01:24:58,496 --> 01:24:59,008
I like

1691
01:24:59,264 --> 01:25:00,032
I like red flag

1692
01:25:00,544 --> 01:25:01,312
Sure

1693
01:25:01,568 --> 01:25:04,896
But

1694
01:25:05,408 --> 01:25:06,176
Let's call it that

1695
01:25:06,688 --> 01:25:08,224
There's always

1696
01:25:08,736 --> 01:25:11,040
Ghetto it deserves to be brought up there's almost

1697
01:25:11,296 --> 01:25:11,808
Always

1698
01:25:12,064 --> 01:25:14,368
A little hurdle of white nationalism wrapped up in

1699
01:25:14,624 --> 01:25:15,648
Most answer your bored

1700
01:25:15,904 --> 01:25:16,416
Incrowd

1701
01:25:16,672 --> 01:25:17,696
When you just did a little bit better

1702
01:25:17,952 --> 01:25:23,328
Play the surface you're pretty much always find that a lot of their fears arise from Notions like there aren't enough

1703
01:25:23,584 --> 01:25:25,120
People like us having kids

1704
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:28,192
And too many people unlike us hanging around

1705
01:25:28,448 --> 01:25:29,728
That's kind of been

1706
01:25:29,984 --> 01:25:30,752
A ton of it

1707
01:25:31,008 --> 01:25:35,360
Which is why they their highest touted argument that they always do is

1708
01:25:35,872 --> 01:25:42,016
Nobody should care more about anti-abortion than black people because millions of black babies are aborted all the time

1709
01:25:42,528 --> 01:25:43,552
Care most about it

1710
01:25:43,808 --> 01:25:44,832
And they do that because

1711
01:25:45,088 --> 01:25:45,600
To protect

1712
01:25:45,856 --> 01:25:46,880
Themselves on the on the

1713
01:25:47,136 --> 01:25:47,904
The flank

1714
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:50,464
People noticing that all you really want is more white

1715
01:25:50,976 --> 01:25:52,000
Does

1716
01:25:52,256 --> 01:25:52,768
The strategy

1717
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:57,632
Crusade mask

1718
01:25:57,888 --> 01:26:01,984
Is some kind of a noble battle against population as evidence

1719
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:06,080
By his experience in China 40 years ago which resulted in

1720
01:26:06,336 --> 01:26:06,848
Expelled from stamp

1721
01:26:07,616 --> 01:26:09,152
This guy is not on the up-and-up

1722
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:15,808
So you probably are wondering how can you afford to run this kind of very clearly disingenuous operation

1723
01:26:16,832 --> 01:26:18,624
Right-wing billionaires

1724
01:26:19,136 --> 01:26:23,744
The population Research Institute is heavily funded by the Linden Harry Bradley Foundation

1725
01:26:24,512 --> 01:26:29,120
Harry Bradley naturally was the first members of the John Birch Society along with Fred Coe

1726
01:26:29,376 --> 01:26:31,936
And the two bad if shared a very similar Legacy

1727
01:26:32,192 --> 01:26:33,472
In terms of funneling money to

1728
01:26:34,496 --> 01:26:37,056
The Bradley Foundation is contributed millions of dollars

1729
01:26:37,312 --> 01:26:38,080
The donors Trust

1730
01:26:38,336 --> 01:26:40,384
The coax operated dark money conduit

1731
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:41,408
Which is one of

1732
01:26:41,664 --> 01:26:42,176
Buddy connection

1733
01:26:42,432 --> 01:26:46,784
Bradley's in the coke allies and their decades-long Crusade against progress

1734
01:26:47,552 --> 01:26:50,368
Bradley Foundation is given tons and tons of money

1735
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:52,160
2 population research

1736
01:26:52,672 --> 01:26:53,952
Institute and

1737
01:26:54,208 --> 01:26:54,720
This

1738
01:26:54,976 --> 01:26:55,744
Mosher's

1739
01:26:56,256 --> 01:26:56,768
Work

1740
01:26:59,072 --> 01:27:03,936
The Bradley Foundation paid charles-marie $1000000 to write his dogshit book the bell curve

1741
01:27:04,192 --> 01:27:06,496
Which to this day is one of the main sources White

1742
01:27:06,752 --> 01:27:11,616
Supremacist .22 justify their beliefs that black people genetically have lower IQs

1743
01:27:12,896 --> 01:27:14,688
The book has been called a part of a

1744
01:27:15,968 --> 01:27:16,736
Define racism

1745
01:27:16,992 --> 01:27:18,784
Which is no surprise that it

1746
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:19,552
Promoted

1747
01:27:19,808 --> 01:27:21,344
By the likes of Stephon

1748
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:24,928
In all the cool kids running around on YouTube

1749
01:27:26,976 --> 01:27:28,000
The Bradley Foundation

1750
01:27:28,256 --> 01:27:29,024
Funding made that

1751
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:29,792
Possible

1752
01:27:30,048 --> 01:27:31,584
Because they're more than happy to use race

1753
01:27:32,096 --> 01:27:33,376
To push the agenda that there really are

1754
01:27:33,888 --> 01:27:35,168
That's the name of the game

1755
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:37,472
So here we have yet another mouth

1756
01:27:37,728 --> 01:27:42,336
Peace for right-wing billionaire funded front groups appearing as a guest on Alex Jones Show

1757
01:27:42,592 --> 01:27:43,360
Presented

1758
01:27:43,872 --> 01:27:45,152
Benignly

1759
01:27:46,176 --> 01:27:47,712
Is an expert on population

1760
01:27:48,992 --> 01:27:49,760
How it always goes

1761
01:27:53,088 --> 01:27:53,600
Fires

1762
01:27:55,136 --> 01:27:55,648
Because

1763
01:27:57,184 --> 01:28:00,256
Sure

1764
01:28:02,816 --> 01:28:04,352
Speedway all over the place

1765
01:28:10,752 --> 01:28:12,800
How does right-wing billionaires

1766
01:28:18,432 --> 01:28:19,712
Is it true that you know it's a

1767
01:28:19,968 --> 01:28:22,272
Tradition going all the way back for some reason

1768
01:28:22,528 --> 01:28:23,040
Ouija

1769
01:28:23,296 --> 01:28:23,808
Rich people just

1770
01:28:24,064 --> 01:28:25,088
Show up and fukitol

1771
01:28:25,344 --> 01:28:27,904
The problem is transparency

1772
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:29,184
Problem

1773
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:32,512
Who's making people show who's there donating money

1774
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:34,304
These these Largent

1775
01:28:35,072 --> 01:28:36,096
It needs to be open

1776
01:28:36,608 --> 01:28:38,144
Because the influences sew-ins

1777
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:41,984
Sidious

1778
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:43,264
Stefano's so much money

1779
01:28:43,776 --> 01:28:46,080
And enables so many

1780
01:28:46,336 --> 01:28:48,640
Suspicious

1781
01:28:48,896 --> 01:28:55,040
It was a hundred thousand dollars from the people who

1782
01:28:55,808 --> 01:28:58,368
Are interested in getting rid of affirmative action

1783
01:28:58,624 --> 01:29:02,464
That's why you're promoting the people of genetically dumber than white people

1784
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:04,000
You can make the calls wilken

1785
01:29:04,512 --> 01:29:05,792
Between the money and the rhetoric

1786
01:29:06,048 --> 01:29:07,584
If it's all open

1787
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:08,352
Butts

1788
01:29:08,608 --> 01:29:09,632
It's so often.

1789
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:11,424
It's much harder issue

1790
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:15,520
Years of years of

1791
01:29:16,032 --> 01:29:17,568
That ability to funnel money place

1792
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:19,360
Secretly goes on

1793
01:29:20,384 --> 01:29:20,896
The damage

1794
01:29:25,248 --> 01:29:26,528
That would have been away

1795
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:28,064
To avoid this

1796
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:30,624
At this point just going by

1797
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:32,672
Shame doesn't exist anymore strategy

1798
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:34,976
That I wouldn't be surprised if they

1799
01:29:35,488 --> 01:29:36,256
Came out in real life

1800
01:29:36,512 --> 01:29:39,328
Donated all the money by Coke

1801
01:29:44,704 --> 01:29:45,728
I mean there's still some irony

1802
01:29:47,008 --> 01:29:47,776
You know cuz

1803
01:29:49,056 --> 01:29:53,920
All of this was exposed to the light of day a lot of these people who have these like ideas about

1804
01:29:54,432 --> 01:29:56,480
Yeah you know what's wrong

1805
01:29:57,504 --> 01:30:00,064
These billionaires are controlling conversation

1806
01:30:00,576 --> 01:30:02,112
I never realized that a ton of things

1807
01:30:02,368 --> 01:30:04,672
They support are funded by other

1808
01:30:04,928 --> 01:30:10,048
Secretive right-wing billionaire on

1809
01:30:10,304 --> 01:30:13,376
They call these people would have to rest with the ideas like

1810
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:16,960
The people on our side who fit the description of the

1811
01:30:17,216 --> 01:30:20,032
The demons that we are against are actually the ones funding

1812
01:30:20,288 --> 01:30:22,080
The information sources that we have

1813
01:30:22,592 --> 01:30:23,104
Huh

1814
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:29,504
Let's go let's go

1815
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:32,064
What else you got to make but it's hard to

1816
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:33,088
2 defense

1817
01:30:33,344 --> 01:30:34,880
So they could make that jump

1818
01:30:36,672 --> 01:30:39,232
The box that's really difficult to defend

1819
01:30:39,488 --> 01:30:42,048
It's possible but I don't know

1820
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:45,632
Like I don't I don't know what the right answer is

1821
01:30:45,888 --> 01:30:46,400
Transparency

1822
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:49,984
I agree it'll allow for

1823
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:52,032
A better

1824
01:30:52,544 --> 01:30:53,056
Possible future

1825
01:30:54,592 --> 01:30:55,872
So one of these interesting

1826
01:30:57,152 --> 01:30:59,456
On this episode I heard a intro

1827
01:30:59,968 --> 01:31:01,504
Commercial that I've never heard before

1828
01:31:02,016 --> 01:31:03,040
On Alex's show and it

1829
01:31:03,296 --> 01:31:04,064
F****** hilarious

1830
01:31:04,832 --> 01:31:10,976
Don't worry this is documented Alex Jones

1831
01:31:11,232 --> 01:31:17,376
Radio Network

1832
01:31:17,632 --> 01:31:18,912
What just happened

1833
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:25,824
Worried illegal immigrants

1834
01:31:26,336 --> 01:31:29,664
No

1835
01:31:30,944 --> 01:31:31,456
I get it

1836
01:31:32,224 --> 01:31:34,272
He's saying all the claims are

1837
01:31:36,064 --> 01:31:36,832
Okay yes

1838
01:31:37,344 --> 01:31:41,952
Don't worry

1839
01:31:42,208 --> 01:31:44,768
Consider that as a possibility because I thought it was

1840
01:31:45,024 --> 01:31:47,072
Too far beyond the pale for them to even

1841
01:31:47,584 --> 01:31:49,120
Take that back

1842
01:31:49,376 --> 01:31:50,400
Does anti

1843
01:31:50,656 --> 01:31:51,168
Immigrants

1844
01:31:51,424 --> 01:31:51,936
28

1845
01:31:52,192 --> 01:31:54,752
Extension 2013 but not to the extent he is

1846
01:31:55,008 --> 01:32:00,128
Is that was played in now

1847
01:32:00,384 --> 01:32:04,736
Consider what your don't worry

1848
01:32:06,016 --> 01:32:09,856
I thought it was

1849
01:32:10,112 --> 01:32:12,928
Hey I know this sounds crazy but we know what talking about

1850
01:32:13,184 --> 01:32:13,952
Alright

1851
01:32:14,208 --> 01:32:17,280
Cy Hackler so raise for all of the racism

1852
01:32:17,536 --> 01:32:20,352
It's it's like me like I heard that and I was like

1853
01:32:20,864 --> 01:32:21,376
Don't worry

1854
01:32:21,888 --> 01:32:22,912
We don't have any mechs

1855
01:32:23,936 --> 01:32:25,216
Jesus Christ

1856
01:32:25,984 --> 01:32:28,288
I see where you're coming from

1857
01:32:28,544 --> 01:32:29,056
I think it's

1858
01:32:29,312 --> 01:32:29,824
Much

1859
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:31,104
Much more likely

1860
01:32:33,152 --> 01:32:35,968
Freezer chest

1861
01:32:37,504 --> 01:32:40,320
So in this point I don't care to address

1862
01:32:40,576 --> 01:32:43,392
Specifics of what he's talking about going to play this

1863
01:32:43,648 --> 01:32:44,160
Freaky

1864
01:32:44,416 --> 01:32:44,928
Comical nature

1865
01:32:45,952 --> 01:32:49,280
We hear 04

1866
01:33:01,312 --> 01:33:07,456
I don't really care about that all I care about is the idea these like operation

1867
01:33:07,712 --> 01:33:08,480
He doesn't realize

1868
01:33:08,736 --> 01:33:12,576
Bradley Foundation funded

1869
01:33:12,832 --> 01:33:15,648
What's going on here

1870
01:33:15,904 --> 01:33:21,792
Himself is some guy he's like how are you so blind

1871
01:33:22,048 --> 01:33:23,840
How are you so blind to the eye

1872
01:33:24,096 --> 01:33:26,144
The people that you're in League with

1873
01:33:26,656 --> 01:33:28,448
Who were taking right-wing Foundation

1874
01:33:36,384 --> 01:33:37,920
Or the way that he would try and talk

1875
01:33:38,176 --> 01:33:38,688
His way out of that

1876
01:33:39,456 --> 01:33:40,992
It always has to because

1877
01:33:41,248 --> 01:33:42,784
You such into movies that has to be at

1878
01:33:43,552 --> 01:33:44,064
Struggle

1879
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:46,624
It always has been one side's God one side

1880
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:48,416
Coronavirus

1881
01:33:48,672 --> 01:33:49,696
Super couldn't get away with

1882
01:33:51,488 --> 01:33:53,280
I think he doesn't know s***

1883
01:33:53,792 --> 01:33:54,816
Because research

1884
01:33:55,584 --> 01:33:57,632
She knows about this

1885
01:33:58,912 --> 01:34:01,728
Carnegie Endowment in Rockefeller Foundation

1886
01:34:01,984 --> 01:34:04,544
From people like w Cleon skousen

1887
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:05,568
And all of these ants

1888
01:34:05,824 --> 01:34:08,384
Communist s******* that came before

1889
01:34:08,896 --> 01:34:10,176
He only knows

1890
01:34:10,432 --> 01:34:12,224
The stuff that they've pointed out

1891
01:34:12,736 --> 01:34:16,576
So his body of information is so one-sided

1892
01:34:17,088 --> 01:34:18,112
And he doesn't dig into things

1893
01:34:18,368 --> 01:34:21,440
So he doesn't know

1894
01:34:21,696 --> 01:34:23,488
Billionaire Foundation

1895
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:24,768
They're funneling

1896
01:34:25,024 --> 01:34:25,792
Money to all

1897
01:34:26,048 --> 01:34:26,560
These other places

1898
01:34:26,816 --> 01:34:27,328
Is that

1899
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:28,352
Suspiciously

1900
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:30,400
Just like

1901
01:34:31,424 --> 01:34:32,192
Mosers just

1902
01:34:32,448 --> 01:34:35,008
Fuckingawesome dude who cares about

1903
01:34:35,264 --> 01:34:38,080
The myth of depopulation through started this Foundation

1904
01:34:38,336 --> 01:34:39,104
Thankfully

1905
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:43,712
The Grassroots

1906
01:34:43,968 --> 01:34:46,016
I'm in maybe he does believe that cuz he doesn't

1907
01:34:46,272 --> 01:34:46,784
Do any

1908
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:49,856
Possible

1909
01:34:50,624 --> 01:34:51,904
Just because so many of his

1910
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:53,696
Friends of taking money from

1911
01:34:53,952 --> 01:34:54,720
You bet

1912
01:34:55,232 --> 01:34:55,744
Places that are

1913
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:57,280
It's like he never

1914
01:34:57,792 --> 01:34:59,328
Nobody let him on that it was

1915
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:00,352
Giant

1916
01:35:00,608 --> 01:35:01,120
You know like

1917
01:35:01,376 --> 01:35:04,448
A Bi-Lo didn't let him know that coat bought two hundred thousand

1918
01:35:04,704 --> 01:35:06,240
Facebook or whatever the f*** it is 8

1919
01:35:06,496 --> 01:35:09,312
Really hard to believe that he's that naive

1920
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:10,592
Yeah

1921
01:35:11,104 --> 01:35:13,408
Different business

1922
01:35:13,664 --> 01:35:14,432
I don't believe

1923
01:35:14,688 --> 01:35:20,832
Can someone who can't prove anything I can't believe the contrary

1924
01:35:23,904 --> 01:35:25,184
I don't know it's complicated

1925
01:35:25,952 --> 01:35:27,488
I'm 31 last clip here

1926
01:35:27,744 --> 01:35:29,024
I'm in and what day is it

1927
01:35:29,536 --> 01:35:32,352
Essentially like 2000 having this nonsensical conversation

1928
01:35:32,864 --> 01:35:34,400
About how overpopulation

1929
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:37,472
Birth control stupid

1930
01:35:42,848 --> 01:35:43,872
To the sky

1931
01:35:44,128 --> 01:35:45,152
Vaca demography

1932
01:35:45,408 --> 01:35:46,176
Lies behind

1933
01:35:46,432 --> 01:35:47,200
Arguments

1934
01:35:47,456 --> 01:35:47,968
Cities making any

1935
01:35:48,224 --> 01:35:49,248
He's really just a

1936
01:35:49,504 --> 01:35:50,528
Anti-abortion

1937
01:35:50,784 --> 01:35:51,552
Contraception

1938
01:35:51,808 --> 01:35:52,320
Zealot

1939
01:35:52,576 --> 01:35:54,880
He's concerned about variable birthrate switch

1940
01:35:55,136 --> 01:35:56,416
Ironically exactly

1941
01:35:56,672 --> 01:35:57,696
The same sorts of things that

1942
01:35:57,952 --> 01:36:01,536
Are now in the present-day motivating people to murder Muslims

1943
01:36:01,792 --> 01:36:02,560
Yeah

1944
01:36:03,072 --> 01:36:07,168
Shockingly regularly whenever you hear those sorts of attacks

1945
01:36:07,424 --> 01:36:07,936
People

1946
01:36:08,192 --> 01:36:10,752
Seem to all have that certain there's too many of them

1947
01:36:11,008 --> 01:36:14,592
I'm standing up for the West

1948
01:36:14,848 --> 01:36:16,640
So you know when you hear this

1949
01:36:17,152 --> 01:36:17,920
You kind of realize

1950
01:36:19,456 --> 01:36:20,736
They're making it a little too public

1951
01:36:32,768 --> 01:36:35,328
Family friendly

1952
01:36:48,128 --> 01:36:50,688
2013

1953
01:36:50,944 --> 01:36:57,088
It's crazy

1954
01:36:59,136 --> 01:37:03,488
It's where we hear all this stuff in 2019 it's like

1955
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,048
He's giving overtures to it in a way that

1956
01:37:06,304 --> 01:37:06,816
People don't

1957
01:37:07,328 --> 01:37:07,840
We didn't

1958
01:37:08,608 --> 01:37:09,376
I don't know I don't want

1959
01:37:09,632 --> 01:37:11,936
For everybody but I think a lot of people probably wouldn't

1960
01:37:12,192 --> 01:37:13,728
Have that register as like

1961
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:16,288
What he's talking about is intense

1962
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:21,152
I think you just hear that in a much different

1963
01:37:21,408 --> 01:37:22,432
In 2013

1964
01:37:22,944 --> 01:37:24,992
Goodnight do we do now because

1965
01:37:25,504 --> 01:37:31,392
People are acting on it now

1966
01:37:31,904 --> 01:37:33,184
Not a radio show that nobody's asked

1967
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:35,488
This further is my point

1968
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,304
That this wasn't being discussed on Fox News

1969
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:39,072
In 2013

1970
01:37:39,328 --> 01:37:39,840
Probably.

1971
01:37:40,096 --> 01:37:42,912
This is what Alex was doing that is now a

1972
01:37:43,168 --> 01:37:45,472
Acceptable for Fox News to talk about

1973
01:37:45,728 --> 01:37:48,032
I thought he must get more extreme in 2019

1974
01:37:48,288 --> 01:37:50,080
This doesn't get to

1975
01:37:50,336 --> 01:37:51,104
The audience

1976
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:52,128
Aroused

1977
01:37:53,408 --> 01:37:54,432
2019

1978
01:37:55,456 --> 01:37:56,480
This is

1979
01:37:56,736 --> 01:37:57,504
Pretty messed up

1980
01:37:57,760 --> 01:37:58,272
Oh man

1981
01:37:58,784 --> 01:38:01,600
Yeah it is exactly

1982
01:38:01,856 --> 01:38:02,880
Where we were

1983
01:38:03,392 --> 01:38:06,720
The crazy people being where we are now with

1984
01:38:07,744 --> 01:38:11,072
You you compare that to the way Fox News cover the migraine

1985
01:38:11,328 --> 01:38:12,096
Caravan is

1986
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:14,144
Flood

1987
01:38:17,216 --> 01:38:18,752
Pets that are bored

1988
01:38:19,264 --> 01:38:20,544
You know that whole thing and you think

1989
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:22,592
This guy was just saying

1990
01:38:23,104 --> 01:38:23,616
Boats

1991
01:38:24,128 --> 01:38:25,152
Muslims in 20

1992
01:38:25,408 --> 01:38:26,176
14in Fox News

1993
01:38:26,432 --> 01:38:27,200
Never would have touched

1994
01:38:34,624 --> 01:38:35,392
Position

1995
01:38:35,904 --> 01:38:36,928
It doesn't

1996
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:37,952
Like it was

1997
01:38:38,464 --> 01:38:43,328
Covert

1998
01:38:45,376 --> 01:38:46,656
Pretty crazy

1999
01:38:47,936 --> 01:38:49,216
Especially because like this

2000
01:38:49,472 --> 01:38:51,008
Stretch of time is so bizarrely

2001
01:38:51,264 --> 01:38:52,032
Like Alex's

2002
01:38:52,544 --> 01:38:55,872
Already kind of letting doerner by the wayside

2003
01:38:58,944 --> 01:38:59,712
To be enough for him

2004
01:39:00,224 --> 01:39:01,504
And then you get a f******

2005
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:03,040
Meteor coming in

2006
01:39:03,296 --> 01:39:04,064
On the 15th

2007
01:39:05,088 --> 01:39:06,112
Interview with

2008
01:39:06,624 --> 01:39:07,392
Complete racist

2009
01:39:07,648 --> 01:39:09,184
Population guide

2010
01:39:10,464 --> 01:39:11,488
Crazy

2011
01:39:11,744 --> 01:39:12,256
Never

2012
01:39:13,024 --> 01:39:13,792
Philip surprise

2013
01:39:15,072 --> 01:39:16,864
Lakers 2013

2014
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:19,680
There's so much happening in the world

2015
01:39:19,936 --> 01:39:21,984
You got Obama coming in for his second term

2016
01:39:22,240 --> 01:39:24,800
So a lot of people are f****** up a tizzy about that

2017
01:39:25,312 --> 01:39:27,872
You've got so many newsworthy

2018
01:39:28,384 --> 01:39:29,664
Gigantic events happen

2019
01:39:37,344 --> 01:39:37,856
So weird

2020
01:39:39,648 --> 01:39:40,672
Stinking wallet

2021
01:39:41,696 --> 01:39:42,464
While the earlier clips

2022
01:39:42,976 --> 01:39:43,488
We're going on

2023
01:39:44,512 --> 01:39:45,792
If I

2024
01:39:46,048 --> 01:39:46,816
Cuz I always forget

2025
01:39:47,072 --> 01:39:48,864
This is ostensibly supposed to be a new show

2026
01:39:49,888 --> 01:39:53,728
Yeah it is easy to forget that

2027
01:39:53,984 --> 01:39:56,032
If I was just listening to this show

2028
01:39:56,544 --> 01:39:58,080
I think I would have no idea what

2029
01:39:58,336 --> 01:39:58,848
Going on

2030
01:40:00,384 --> 01:40:00,896
Like URI

2031
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:04,480
Say you were informed

2032
01:40:04,736 --> 01:40:05,760
Certainly

2033
01:40:06,272 --> 01:40:07,552
No clue other than

2034
01:40:07,808 --> 01:40:09,088
An asteroid Mike

2035
01:40:16,512 --> 01:40:17,024
Because they're doing it

2036
01:40:19,072 --> 01:40:21,120
Yeah I think you would not be informed

2037
01:40:21,632 --> 01:40:22,144
For sure

2038
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:28,544
But you would get the message that I was watching it again

2039
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:31,872
Unhealthy level of distrust for everybody

2040
01:40:39,296 --> 01:40:40,832
Bring us to the end here

2041
01:40:41,088 --> 01:40:41,856

And another large Asuza for absolute

Merchsource

2052
01:41:29,984 --> 01:41:30,752
Store or shirts

2053
01:41:31,008 --> 01:41:35,104
Figure it out

2054
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:35,872
To the store

2055

Thank you are really gorgeous

2056
01:41:40,224 --> 01:41:42,272
So

2057
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:50,464
Alex is imaginary chihuahua in his dog murder scenario

2058
01:41:51,488 --> 01:41:52,512
Navigate dog was

2059
01:41:53,024 --> 01:41:53,792
Did have rabies

2060
01:41:54,048 --> 01:41:56,096
The Chihuahua that was

2061
01:41:56,352 --> 01:41:58,912
Attacked by the dog

2062
01:41:59,168 --> 01:42:04,288
The two hours just you don't know what happened after it got rabies probably

2063
01:42:04,544 --> 01:42:10,688
That's because we don't know that for sure we should probably are on the side of believing the Chihuahua

2064
01:42:10,944 --> 01:42:11,712
Did not kill anybody

2065
01:42:11,968 --> 01:42:14,272
But one guy

2066
01:42:20,416 --> 01:42:24,000
Alex
