5
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:26,624
Do you feel like it's a return to form for a scooter

6
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:33,024
His fastball for the past 45 years

7
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,120
Everything was downhill from f*** the world

00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:39,936
Great songs

00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:42,496

21
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:21,920
You asked me what

22
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:24,224
Coincidentally end up

00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,504
Pictures of dog

00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,272

00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:39,328
Everybody was like get well soon dad and then people were mad at me

00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:45,728
Turn off

29
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,520
Well that's because I

00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:59,552
I can't do all the stuff that I have to do what I'm rising in a ball

31
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,856
Anyway that is kind of rude of them

32
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:05,952
Apologize

33
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:08,000

34
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:08,768

35
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:11,584
To be here

36
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,888

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,192

47
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:52,032
I call people whatever comes up

48
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:55,616

Very exciting

50
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,344
Heartfelt

51
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,160
Dispersion

52
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:12,256
An elevator

Don't get mad and tell her you're brilliant someone sodomite sent me a bucket of poop

55
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:28,640
The real Alex

56
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:35,040
I really sorry but I just don't think you can afford to donate

57
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:38,624
You got to save that money man

58
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:43,232
And what should be supported

59
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,328
I don't want to make

60
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,400
Difficult

61
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:55,008
Like alternating

62
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,544
Taking really hot

63
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:57,824
And laying in bed

64
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:58,848
Skyrim

65
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:00,128
Cuz I couldn't barely move

66
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:04,480
Great great work done I wanted to jump

67
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:06,016
With this Alex Jones full show

68
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,576
And if

69
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,904
Wewewewe recording this

70
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,976
Beginning of the week

71
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,000
Thursday was

72
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:20,607
Weird things

73
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:24,959
You things have happened in the

74
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,751
In the world

75
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,287
Particular like

76
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:30,079
I know that a couple things were posted

77
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,359
The group

78
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,663
You think about this

79
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:34,687
I thought at the beginning.

80
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,711
Be good

81
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,015
Give a blanket comment on a cup

82
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:44,415
Yeah a little bit

83
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:46,719
Blog post for a sore

84
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,511
Surprised that Alex Joseph

85
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,559
Football players kneeling

86
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:54,143
And my comments

87
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,935
My comment

88
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:56,959
Why is this person

89
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,823
I have no comment about that

90
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:03,359
He's very much

91
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:04,895
Afraid of

92
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:06,431
The big part of the narrative

93
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:11,807
We don't need to spend mainly afraid of black people exercising any kind of Rights

94
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:13,599
Replace

95
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,183
Not a fan

96
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:20,255
Actually got a message

97
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,535
Scrum up

98
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,583
This is actually really

99
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,703
Alex Jones

100
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,471
We crashed

101
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,287
But what was

102
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,567
Weather

103
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:40,223
Charlie warzel from

104
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:41,503
Withal

105
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,295
Talkin about

106
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,439
To derail the proceedings

107
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:53,535
Superhero

108
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:57,631
It's super ironic because part of the panel what they were talking about was Alex

109
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:00,191
His situation and then lo and behold

110
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:01,983
Derails

111
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:02,751
The ability of the

112
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,455
Anime

113
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,479
Well they offered

114
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:16,831
Him a place on the diets they offered him to engage

115
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:17,599
Just kept yelling

116
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,183
And appointed Jonathan brought up

117
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:24,767
As soon as I saw the story

118
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,815
I don't want to talk about

119
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:27,583
This is just

120
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,631
Him further deteriorating

121
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:31,167
Declining

122
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,471
He's no longer on place

123
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,007
Going to go bum rush

124
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:40,127
Somehow

125
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,687
Iuc a mental

126
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:43,967
State deteriorate

127
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,271
He's just yelling slogan

128
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,039
Was like

129
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,647
36

130
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:52,415
Substance

131
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,439
Just yelling

132
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:55,999
Anime

133
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:56,767
Another really good

134
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:00,351
Is interesting that we haven't brought up with

135
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,887
Sincerely

136
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,167
If you look at the way that Owen

137
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:05,727
These days

138
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,519
It's kind of like the child of an hour

139
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,287
Alcoholic parent

140
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:12,639
You know how like when

141
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:13,663
Turned on Trump

142
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,247
Alex maybe we should stop maybe we should

143
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:20,575
Do you know

144
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,111
That's sort of like trying to

145
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,647
The out of

146
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,671
Control parents

147
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:29,279
He brought that up and I thought that was really interesting I wanted to

148
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,303
Give him credit for that

149
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,375
It's an interesting thought

150
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:36,191
Not worth of doing a breakdown of

151
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:36,959
Him crashing his

152
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:44,639
Yeah well we have called

153
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:47,455
Basically

154
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:49,759
Alex Jones

155
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:50,527
Daddy

156
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:52,063
Like that's that thing but

157
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,623
Buff's

158
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,415
Freddy buff song

159
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,743
Coming up

160
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:01,535
I'm sure Alex

161
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,071
Bulshit about

162
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,095
Kavanaugh

163
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,375
And I don't really want it

164
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:06,399
Talk about that

165
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:14,847
I really don't want to scream about any man

166
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:19,455
I don't have I don't have the emotional

167
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:30,719
Probably

168
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:37,375
Investigation is a sham which is something that the news

169
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,399
Probably

170
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,287
It is yet to exist

171
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:53,247
Couldn't really get it up

172
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,527
For that

173
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:57,087
Am I still recovering

174
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,367
Thankfully

175
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,135
The Gods

176
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:00,927
Down upon

177
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,743
Literally

178
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:07,583
Prep episode about

179
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:08,863
Man who

180
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:11,167
You're right you're right

181
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:13,983
I know I told you

182
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:21,151
Kerry Cassidy came out of nowhere and surprise

183
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:26,271
For a little bit

184
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,183
And I was like oh I got

185
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,975
Okay we got to do that

186
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:40,607
Turns out in

187
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:44,191
2013 Brett Kavanaugh

188
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,031
These days

189
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:52,639
Project

190
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:54,687
Where we will

191
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:56,479
Another element of the

192
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,015
What have you

193
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,087
Beginning

194
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:03,391
What carry gives the

195
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,415
The guest credits

196
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,951
Cisco's a little bit long

197
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:06,975
But I think

198
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:10,815
Telescopes

199
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:13,119
Sushi okay

200
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:16,447

201
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:22,591
Hi everyone I'm sure Cassidy from Project Camelot and

202
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:25,407

203
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:27,455

208
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:53,055
So I just want to say that it's great to have you here Sophia and I would have been to do is

209
00:10:54,335 --> 00:11:00,223
Put a bit of your bio on the strain here and and go over that with the audience so that we can

210
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:04,831
Cover a few other points in there and then asked you to sort of

211
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:06,111
Elaborate

212
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,671
So what we've got is that

213
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:12,511
Basically you're the author of The Matrix in The Terminator

214
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:16,863
What is an you have claimed that Hollywood

215
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:20,959

216
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:27,359
And we have an extensive bio here it's on my website I'm putting it on the screen as I speak

217
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:30,687

222
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,351
And I guess store

223
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,399

First of all

310
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:16,895

Examples of a billion dollars

For such a thing are generally stories of Hollywood

358
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,863
There's literally zero chance that anyone is off

359

367
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,983
Before this episode

368
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,007

369
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:25,567
30 bucks

370
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:32,223
At the 30 million dollars out of

371
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:35,039

00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,583
The only thing I find

376
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:50,399
30 million-dollar

377
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:51,935
That's impossible

378
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:53,983
You don't like

379
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,519
If you look at the movies budget

380
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:01,663
So

381
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:03,967

00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,071
Fart before

387
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:21,887
Terrible

388
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:23,679
But I watched.

389
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:32,639
I didn't think you were nearly as bad

390
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,199
Baby

391
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:37,759
Took a little too long to do with maybe some parts

392
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:40,063
Superfluous is help

393
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:46,719
Whatever

394
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:49,791
Easter's next movie was a was a

395
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:52,863
I think so

396
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:56,959
It is

397
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:58,495
Literally unwatchable

398
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:01,311
I've never finished

399
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:03,871
I don't know I

400
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,343
Basic

401
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:15,647
Play music

402
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,952
Why you're saying that

403
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:22,560
Figure of 30 million percent

404
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:25,888
All of her legitimate

405
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,312
Right

406
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,920
Because there's a lot of people out there

407
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:38,688
She doesn't

408
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,712
The Matrix

409
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:40,480
Terminator

410
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:43,296
Articles about that online

411
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:47,904
Why is it that some

412
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:51,744
Articles there was one in 2013

413
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:58,144
Who was saying that some reason that they said that your court case wasn't

414
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,728
Was that because it hadn't settled yet at that point

415
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:05,568
2013 article

416
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,360
It was before I won the

417
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,128
Fort Chaffee

418
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:15,040
2nd court case which was never done in the first court date

419
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:17,856
The inner in my copyright

420
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:20,416
Derivative movie

421
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:22,976
Fancy dinner in Austin

422
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:30,400
Do the derivative movie

423
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:31,936
Creator

424
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:33,984
And two federal judges

425
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,800
The Magistrate Judge

426
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,592
Edward J Park

427
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:41,408
Airport federal judge defensin

428
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:44,736
A ruling validated

429
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:52,416
Movie scenes derivative movies came from my third eye matrix script and book

430
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:57,280
I can send the document over to

431
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,048
Anyone

432
00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,840
Want to dispute it

433
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:04,448
Preemptively defensive is not a good way to live

434
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:10,080
Carrying O'Neal's on the internet

435
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:13,152
2005

436
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:15,456
Got this messenger

437
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:21,856
Aldi descendants Warner Brothers Kaylee and her James Cameron Indian language

00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:26,208
You f***** in all of these defendants they never

00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:30,048
Run that chase a lot of them terminated out before then

440
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:31,072
Just rolling

441
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:34,400
Because they were scared of the RICO going to jail

442
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:38,240
So go to jail

443
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,032
You can

444
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:41,568
You invoke the RICO Act

445
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:47,968
My friends because Joel Silver

446
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:48,992
Warner Brothers

447
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:52,576
They all got together and formed the criminal syndicate

448
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:56,416
In order to rip off Sophia Stewart the rightful owner of

449
00:23:56,672 --> 00:24:02,816
The Matrix and Terminator movies also throat

450
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:12,800
To go down everybody's going.

451
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:15,872
Syndicate

452
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:17,664
That's why they

453
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,712
Tricked everybody devoting

454
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:21,248

Governor

456
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:30,464
Two-part I'm sure that's a piece of this

457
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:33,024
Just don't have time to get into Nevada Sophia

458
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:35,584
Assume

459
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,632
But

460
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:38,656
Is one of those things

461
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:39,424
They like

462
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,448
You off

463
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:42,496
People

464
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:43,520
Are making these

465
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:44,288
These audacious

466
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:45,056
Clams

467
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:47,872
Awesome

468
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:52,480
Alex green around racketeering Rico stuff all the time whenever he's

469
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:55,040
It was in The Dark Knight

470
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:57,344
The RICO Act

471
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:58,624
Wachowskis

472
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,184
Warner Brothers worth

473
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:03,744
Terminated out of the original

474
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,816
Oh no I got lost

475
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:08,608
Get it I don't get high

476
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,448
Being sued

477
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:17,312
Biggest state

478
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:26,016
Excuse me

479
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:34,976
I believe you forgot that

480
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,000
So

481
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:39,072
Sorry

482
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:40,864
Her version of adolescence

483
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,144
Accurate

484
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:43,680
You know

485
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:44,960
Who knows

486
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:51,872
Man when we get to the reveal of how this court case actually go down I think we're all waiting with bated breath

487
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,944
This is it this is f******

488
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,736
So would you understand

489
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:59,296
You might be thinking like why are these two

490
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:00,064
Two things connect

491
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,088
Diddy's to IPS

492
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:02,112
Seasonal actual proper

493
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:06,976
Explain

494
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:15,424
So how did you came to write first of all the Matrix and I could

495
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,728
I think that's the first one that came forward

496
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:20,544
And then the Terminator series

497
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:24,384
Terminator actually came first and

498
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:28,736
Terminator and Matrix is one Epic story is five presidents

499
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:30,016
Future time travel

500
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,088
Oh I get it

501
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:34,624
Future

502
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,648
Terminator

503
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:38,464
Beginning of the story Sarah Connor

504
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:41,024
It's really Neo mother

505
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:47,168
Second coming of the Christ

506
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:48,704
Evolution

507
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,496
Consciousness Man versus

508
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:51,264
The machine

509
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:54,848
Another word for the machines here the oracle's prophecy

510
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,176
Baby is going to be born that's going to grow up to

511
00:26:59,456 --> 00:26:59,968
Future

512
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:02,016
I've actually been terminated

513
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:02,784
Coming soon

514
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,576
Sarah Carter

515
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,648
Without

516
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:12,768
Because they look just like we look wrapped in flesh Killah cannot be

517
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:15,840
Looking for Sarah Connor

518
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:19,168
Kill her so the baby Neo will never be born

519
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:20,448
Right

520
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:21,728
John Connor

521
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:24,032
Jay-Z John Collins

522
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:24,800
I get it

523
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:28,384
The Matrix

524
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:34,784
What does a matrix

525
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,552
20

526
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:37,856
Check 1984

527
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:39,904
And my copyrights or 90

528
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,440
8180

529
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,976
3 + 84

530
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,560
Way before the movie

531
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:48,608
Hello they did was the Jap

532
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:50,400
Mike Griffin my foot

533
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:51,424
Scream

534
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,752
Immediately

535
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:58,336
Indiana 1999 March 31st

536
00:27:58,592 --> 00:27:59,872
The release of The Matrix

537
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:02,176
That's when they treated The Matrix

538
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:04,224
Trilogy

539
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:06,784
One thing that's important to consider is that like

540
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:08,832
Terminator came out

541
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:11,136
You're 1984

542
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:11,904
Began to develop

543
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:13,440
Or anything like that

544
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:18,048
Especially a movie like that in the early 80s

545
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:21,888
Year-and-a-half

546
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:22,656
To make a movie

547
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:24,960
I would assume the editing process

548
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:28,544
Right right if you can actually look into the history of houses

549
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,312
Terminator movie

550
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:34,432
It took a while people didn't have much faith in the idea and

551
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:41,088
We were like that dude can't even speak English there's no way this is going to work out

552
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:45,696
Right now is I guarantee the producers of the Terminator were like well

553
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:46,464
I'll tell you what

554
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,488
This

555
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:49,024
Governor of California

556
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,072
I do like

557
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:56,960
Like like you responded to the the idea of like

558
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:58,240
I want to see

559
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:00,800
Crossword

560
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,896
Look I saw Alien versus Predator that f******

561
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:05,920
Suck butt

562
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:08,736
Matrix versus Terminator

563
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:10,272
But you know the reason

564
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:16,928
Very old archetype

565
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:18,976
I was going today

566
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:20,000
Sort of blend

567
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:20,768
Together

568
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:26,400
Because they both

569
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:27,680
View sort of Savior Ark

570
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:28,704
Archetypes

571
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,568
Technology

572
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:34,336
Yours

573
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:37,664
Since we started making robots

574
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:41,760
The technology electricity

575
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:43,296
So

576
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:44,320
That's why they

577
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:46,112
Come together

578
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:50,208
Drawn Together

579
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,744
I will say this

580
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,768
Siri can do some research

581
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:54,560
And you can't find that

582
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,120

It is

Listed here as

Tired

595
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:29,120
I believe

596
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:33,216
Here

597
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:34,496
6 pages long

598
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:40,384
It's a manuscript

00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,152
Treatment

600
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:44,992
Yeah it's

601
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:46,272
Read the manuscript

602
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:51,904
Treatments that she shopped around and if it's only six pages long I'm going to guess it was not

603
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:54,464
You can't save

604
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:58,048
Zakir what that you put out a book

605
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:00,864
She's basing a lot of

606
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,192
You can't take away that it was

607
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:06,240
In 1983

608
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:13,152
Presumably a year before Terminator came out there isn't a copyright that she has on file for this third eye

609
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:20,576
Than any other project

610
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:30,304
Suzette alone I think

Cheapest with a little dog

613
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:42,592
Because of media covering it up

614
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:45,408
Well and Schumacher

615
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,688
Terminated the loss

616
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:53,088
At 14 years ago different covering it up in the media

617
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:57,952

Around the world

621
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:13,824
But things have covered up

622
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,360
Story that I won

623
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:17,152
And that's horrible

624
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:19,712
People my fans date they call me

625
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:23,552

Terminator

630
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:39,680
Everyone deserves to know that true

631
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:46,848
Didn't she say everyone has the right to know

632
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:50,432
Which was actually sent

633
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:54,784
Notarized

634
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:57,600
So far so good

00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:03,488
2014

636
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:05,792
Which is a

637
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:07,584
Very specific date

638
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,352

639
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:09,888
Really really likes

640
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:13,216
You might be asking yourself

641
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:19,872
That lawsuit

642
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:23,456
What I'd like to know is whether or not you in your

643
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:28,064
You're winning your case whether you were awarded any money

644
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:36,512
Gordon Thomas a half a million-dollar to attorney fees and

645
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:41,120
3.5 billion dollars and liens on all of their property

646
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:42,656
What happened was

647
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:43,936
I have three

648
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:49,568
CPAs to come in and validate that they own a 4.7 billion dollars

649
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:53,920

00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:57,760

651
00:33:58,016 --> 00:34:01,600
3 + $75,000

Witnesses

653
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:08,256
4.7 billion

654
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:11,584
Okay so 7 billion is a lot

655
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:17,728
Billion dollars

656
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:25,408
Matrix in The Terminator

657
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:35,136

Croswell

662
00:34:56,384 --> 00:35:00,992
The possibilities are endless

663
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,624
Ever showed up

664
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:09,952
Connor like a double whammy

665
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:12,768
I was getting the for law firms that

666
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:15,328
The same time then it's sabotage

667
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:16,352
20K

668
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:19,936
It was supposed to been on my side but they were paid by one of us

669
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:22,496
Sabotage

670
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:28,640

Do that in my second court case in Utah federal court

674
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:40,672
70 life

675
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:41,952
7 years to

676
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:48,352
September 25th 2014

677
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,120
Cuz he was dead

678
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,192
That actually was one of her mentor

679
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:54,752
I don't think so that guy

680
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,824
I honestly

681
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,872
Did her dirty

682
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:06,272
Girl a little bit

683
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:08,320
Clips explain everything

684
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:14,720
I've been trying to pretend that she has a good point

685
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,400
I really know is

686
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:28,288
Terminator movies for 4 billion

687
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:33,152
All right but

688
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:39,808
Where did you saying that that you sort of had a lien as you called it I think on certain

689
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:40,576
Individual

690
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:44,160
3.5 billion dollars

691
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,560
Perform a debtors

692
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,888
Where they have to come in open up their plugs

693
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:56,192
Show how much money did they have to pay

694
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:59,008
For the property

695
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:02,336
The money order

696
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:05,664
Or I can

697
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:09,760
Sam's sell the property

698
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:13,600
It's been 4 years and she has using the present

699
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:15,136
Are you talking about

700
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:21,024
Who's property Warner Brothers or the individual

701
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,096
Wingstop James Cameron's property

702
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:29,472
In fact I can send you over the lens

703
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:30,752
Captain show

704
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:33,824
And you can actually see the property that I cleaned up

705
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:38,176
Leonard into the court and the judge did not

706
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:39,456
Check out the wings

707
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:41,760
Lions are good

708
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:48,416
So you're a citizen like

709
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,720
So now I have liens

710
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:52,256
You can choose anything you want

711
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:56,608
It's strange that you can do that it's not like the court as a responsibility

712
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:58,912
Yeah

713
00:37:59,168 --> 00:37:59,680
Cut this out

714
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:01,728
Albany

715
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:03,520
Billions of dollars of property

716
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:06,848
James Cameron

717
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:12,224
3.5 million dollars

718
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:12,992
Billion

719
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:21,696
7

720
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:22,976
But you only have

721
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:28,608
3.5 billion

722
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:30,656
I really don't think she's going to win this

723
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:33,472
I really don't think she's going to take this one.

724
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,776
So you really interesting

725
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,848
She's talked about in the present

726
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:41,152
She's explaining it all

727
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:45,504
So you might

728
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:50,624
Okay fair enough but how long have you had the lean

729
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:54,208
Laser good investment

730
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:02,144
Why have you not asked

731
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,448
Particular

732
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,472
Question

733
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:15,200
A lot of people don't know that debtors exams money when you do it

734
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,248
Money to collect

735
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:20,064
ERS when they collect on your land

736
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:21,088
Trf

737
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,256
If this is where I fibro

738
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:30,304
This is where I said no way

739
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:33,376
Because if she

740
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:36,448
She has all these billions of dollars

741
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,728
Anybody

742
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:44,384
I will play I will pay for this debtors exams you give me a million on the back

743
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:52,832
Just served I get a millionaire

744
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:58,464
Give me 300 million of your 4.7 billion.

745
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:04,864
Look more than I normally do hourly

746
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:13,312
Adored

747
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:17,152
Afford to be leaned against like this and he's going to lose weight

748
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:20,224
Weller know he's settled but

749
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:21,248
He's got

750
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,088
This is it this is where things get kind of Interest

751
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:27,392
What do you want to know about

752
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:29,952
About her copyrights

753
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,560
HUD you know what

754
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:35,840
First thing I want to know

755
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:37,888
Is she actually a published

756
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:42,496
Probably

757
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:45,056
I apologize

758
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:48,384
Most likely

759
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:53,760
Simon & Schuster knocked on her door so I don't think we got to have the force

760
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,856
So they could be part of this Rico

761
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:58,880
Dollar Store

762
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:03,744
What's important to know if you look into this

763
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,328
You find it there

764
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:09,888
Yes veggies

765
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,424
What you doing a little bit

766
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:15,264
The one in California

767
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,800
The first case for California

768
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:20,640
Yes in this case to recharge a suit

769
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:24,736
To file a lawsuit against the Wachowski siblings Joel Silver Warner Brothers

770
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:29,344
And 20th Century Fox claiming the Matrix and Terminator movies were based on her book the third eye

771
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:31,392
In June 2005 the cases

772
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:32,160
Dismissed

773
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:34,720

He is not a real lawyer

818
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:31,711
Mr. Lube

819
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:35,039
Assemble a competent legal team to assist with

820
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:36,319

The other name men Brown Weber and brought in

822
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:42,975
And that's why the Chargers

823
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:44,511
We're just miss

824
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:46,303
Because they were

825
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:48,351
They were mere accessories

826
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:49,375
In action

827
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:56,799
I kind of wouldn't have mattered in the end because she was never going to win that

828
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:59,359
But he was clearly acting poorly of

829
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:02,431
The results of the California case

830
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:04,479

839
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:28,031
Being charged

In the Utah trial the court

00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:37,503
Was still guilty

845
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:38,527

00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:40,479
And then

870
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:45,855
Lost images if any based on the underlying California copyright case

871
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:50,207

872
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:51,487
If any

00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:40,127
In this case

The game of Hearts

895
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:54,463
This is straight from the court.

896
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:57,023
Billion in Damages

897
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:59,071
In the case stemming from an attorney's failure

899
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:06,239
This award what are these documents

900
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:08,799
Consists of a response from a Time Warner entertainment

901
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:10,079
Company lawyer to a patent

902
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:11,103
The trademark office

903
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:14,175

Investment

915
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:43,359
In addition to router

916
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:46,943
The court finds Miss Stewart may not recover damages on this

917
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:50,271
Even assuming the merits of the underlying claim

918
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:55,903
The California defendants would have been able to establish deductible expenses and the prophet not attributable to mistress

919
00:47:57,183 --> 00:48:00,767
Without question the California defendants incurred deductible expenses and making butter

920
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:01,535
Terminator

921
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:04,863
The gross revenue numbers Mr provide

922
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:05,887
Do not constitute

923
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:07,423
A proper measure of damages

924
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:08,191

That much

927
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:11,263
Even if her lawyers had knocked

928
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:15,871
The court therefore recommends The District Court award Miss Stewart

929
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:18,687
If you order adopting and

930
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:21,247
So it's nothing

931
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:23,807
Divisibility answer is 0 0

932
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:26,111
0 out of 15 billion

933
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:30,207
Any order adopting this report and its recommendations they lay out the

00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:37,887
Miss Stewart

00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:40,191
Subjected to these damn it

938
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:42,495
Entitled to damages connected

939
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:44,799
The prophets of the Terminator and Matrix movie trilogy

940
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:47,615
For reasons stated in the report and recommendation

941
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:49,151
Objection is overruled

942
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:51,455

On her website and

946
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:08,607
Another source

947
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:13,471
I can I can say that they're not like doctor to anything

948
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:14,239
The

949
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:15,519
Appleton

950
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:16,543
Conditions Gamble

951
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:20,639
I'm going to put these up here

952
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:23,455
So I'm just going to clean it says what I want

But this is absurd

961
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:47,519
The first problem is abused copyrights are largely for things that are not content

962
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:50,591
For instance to place the copyright in 2013

963
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:53,407
Play titled the Holograms

964
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:55,199
I love it

She created Terminator

966
00:49:57,247 --> 00:50:03,135
She wrote a screenplay called Terminator 5 the Holograms

967
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:10,559
Copyrights area of law where fraud is rampant

968
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:12,863
For something

969
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:13,631
Could get a patent

970
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:14,911
For it without ever making

971
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:20,543
Yeah there was literally four broadcast

972
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:26,175
Claiming to have

973
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:28,735
Copywriting

974
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:29,759
Specific thing

975
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:31,551
It seems kind of important

976
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:33,087
Prove that it was

977
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:36,159
So one thing that threw me for a huge Loop

978
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:37,695
Is that one of the things

979
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:40,511
Sofia is a certificate of copyright for is the animator

980
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:42,815
Birth certificates from 2030

981
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:44,351
The animatrix

982
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:45,631
Released in 2000

983
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:52,287
I was going to say Denis and Amanda Matrix came between first movie in the second movie

984
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:53,567
Lingering

985
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:57,151
Plot details that the second movie just kind of didn't even bother

986
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:58,943
I thought this was really strange

987
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:00,991
Flyy the producer

988
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:01,759
The animatrix

989
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:03,807
Godavari that have a copyright on their works

990
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:07,391
But then I noticed that this copyright was specifically for an artwork

991
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:09,695
Where is the rest of the copyright she claimed

992
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:10,719
For screenplays

993
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:14,047
Most likely got a copyright for a work of art

994
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:15,071
Call Dad

995
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:17,887
But doesn't violate the existing copyright

996
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:22,495
As they would be in a separate category of copier

997
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:25,567
Right similarly she has a certificate of copyright

998
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:26,335
Parenteral

999
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:28,895
But it's for work described as

1000
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:31,199
Enter the Matrix is a video game

1001
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:33,759
They would have a completely different copyright over that exist

1002
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:35,807
So she has these

1003
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:37,087
These things

1004
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:40,671
What appears to me is that Sophia is doing what you doing is filling

1005
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:43,743
Totally fair copyrights to the works that

1006
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:48,351
You created like Terminator 5 the Hologram tomorrow or the fourth Matrix

1007
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:50,655
Venice 13 copyright claims

1008
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:52,959
Properties

1009
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:53,727
Under differ

1010
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:54,495
Categories

1011
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:55,519
Knowing that the

1012
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:57,823
Purism having a copyright with the name animatrix

1013
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:59,103
Will trick most people into thinking

1014
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:00,895
That you didn't

1015
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:04,479
Desteria server validated by her writing in all caps

1016
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:06,271
On her website

1017
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:10,623
Sophia Stewart has won the copyrights to The Matrix and Terminator movie franchises

1018
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:12,415
The government has settled the matter

1019
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:17,535
The Enter the Matrix copyright

1020
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:19,839
All the shell game

1021
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:23,167
All the kind of mood though because according to

1022
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:24,959
Do the government copyright office close

1023
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:26,495
Copyright does not protect

1024
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:29,055
Concepts

1025
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:31,615
You may express your ideas and writing or drawing

1026
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:32,895
Copyright your

1027
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:35,711
The copyright will not protect the idea

1028
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:38,015
As revealed in your written or are too

1029
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:39,807
Copywriter only

1030
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:41,087
Specific works

1031
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:42,111
The first miscreated

1032
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:44,671
Express in one piece of writing

1033
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:45,695
That might be mirrored in

1034
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:49,535
So she's also saying that she owns the Bible

1035
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:50,815
I mean she'd have to be

1036
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:53,887
She's she saying that she owns

1037
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:56,191
Hero's journey as a con

1038
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:01,311
Alright I like it

1039
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:02,847
I like it I did again

1040
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:05,151
She has

1041
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:07,199
Pleated balls with chrome

1042
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:08,223
There's no doubt

1043
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:11,295
And if interview gets Wild

1044
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:13,855
Okay so you might be asking yourself

1045
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:15,391
Do all this stuff in like

1046
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:16,159
2000

1047
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:20,511
Terminator 1984

1048
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:28,191
You know about them

1049
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:35,359
When did you realize that your your stuff was stolen another words what was the process by which it was stolen

1050
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:39,967
I want people to realize there was never any battle or any

1051
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:42,527
Boring going gone

1052
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:44,063
What I what I did

1053
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:47,647
Go to the movies and I-84 because Cyrus

1054
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:48,927
Pregnant and

1055
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:50,207
I was married

1056
00:53:55,327 --> 00:54:00,447
Play March 31st 1999

1057
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:03,263
Being a paralegal

1058
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:05,311
Attorney

1059
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:07,615
Can a doctor I called up one of us

1060
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:08,895
Legal department

1061
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:12,479
I come from a military law enforcement family

1062
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:14,527
So I know the law

1063
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:18,623
That doesn't make sense but they offered me 5 million dollars

1064
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:25,279
Cactus when I was 11

1065
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:27,839
Like H&R Block I was getting

1066
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:29,887
IPhone 6

1067
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:32,703
Understand

1068
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:35,519
Just why H&R Block

1069
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:39,615
But I was already in Austin for New Orleans

1070
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:41,407
And doing also at the

1071
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:42,687
Teenager payroll

1072
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:46,015
Creating grown people's paycheck

1073
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:50,367
49ers

1074
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:53,951
Sam's which is nothing but pure math and they wanted me to come and work for them

1075
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:56,767
The number that's why you

1076
00:54:57,023 --> 00:54:58,047
The Matrix

1077
00:54:58,559 --> 00:54:59,583
Binary code

1078
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:01,887
109

1079
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:03,679
Quantum physics

1080
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:04,703
Calculus

1081
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:11,615
Sacred geometry why are we throwing in ancient sacred geometry

1082
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:15,711
No you got to throw it in

1083
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:17,247
Did she just

1084
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:21,087
Did she just say that the reason that she

1085
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:23,135
No she owns The Matrix

1086
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:24,671
Is because they use

1087
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:27,743
Because she

1088
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:29,279
Countenance

1089
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:30,815
At 11

1090
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:36,447
I don't know

1091
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:37,215
I think it's

1092
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:42,079
Spaghetti on the wall

1093
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:47,455
Okay I was pregnant

1094
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:48,735
United 84

1095
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:53,599
And so

1096
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:55,903
But now she's

1097
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:57,183
Yo comes around

1098
00:55:57,439 --> 00:55:59,743
She's going to movies now

1099
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:06,143
Kids AR-15

1100
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:09,471
Free movie tickets

1101
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:13,567
Get the ability to watch movies

1102
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,871
The Matrix

1103
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:16,639
She's like

1104
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:18,687
Gall darn it

1105
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:19,711
Of course

1106
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:23,039
The lawyer

1107
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:27,391
Seems a little bit preemptive

1108
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:33,279
It is next week we just talked about our work

1109
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:36,351
Is copyrighted

1110
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:38,399
Good carry-out after

1111
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:39,167
Okay

1112
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:40,703
You trying to get to that in this

1113
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:41,983
Are you saying

1114
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:44,031
How did you know

1115
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:46,079
What was the process

1116
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:48,639
She tries to understand

1117
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:49,663
How did this start

1118
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:55,551
In other words how did they get your work where was your work did you submit to

1119
00:56:55,807 --> 00:57:01,695
It's kind of sounds like you didn't submit it to a film company

1120
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:05,279
Send it over to 20 Century Fox looking

1121
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:06,047
Ford

1122
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:07,583
George Lucas

1123
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:09,887
When I saw Star Wars

1124
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:15,263
And I didn't know this song

1125
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:16,799
What's the director

1126
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:22,431
And I wanted yesterday I wrecked my work because I wanted him to my work to Lucas

1127
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:27,807
Alright

1128
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:30,623
Book to him at $0.20

1129
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:36,255
Was vice president creative affairs

1130
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:41,375
Was commercially

1131
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:42,399
Is she just

1132
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:45,471
Ronnie and Gale Anne Hurd

1133
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:48,799
Cameron and all these people in database

1134
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:56,223
Appreciate that but your name was on it your copyright was on it

1135
00:57:56,479 --> 00:57:58,271
How did you get submitted over

1136
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:03,903
81

1137
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:06,975
Steve anything

1138
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:11,071
What what

1139
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:17,471
That's pretty ludicrous every Studio

1140
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:20,287
Just like a hey unsolicited Scripts

1141
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:25,663
This is this is cockamamie because

1142
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:27,711
She and other places

1143
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:28,479
Claimed

1144
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:31,807
That the wachowskis posted that they wanted like

1145
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:32,575
Submission

1146
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:33,343
Things for science

1147
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:37,439
And that she sent her work into them

1148
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:44,095
Craigslist Craigslist

1149
00:58:44,351 --> 00:58:47,167
Who gives a s*** if you don't have engine

1150
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:50,239
And you did have ages

1151
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:55,871
We're going all the way back but I'm just saying they like that story is even different than the

1152
00:58:56,383 --> 00:58:58,687
Story that you tell

1153
00:58:58,943 --> 00:58:59,967
The text

1154
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:05,087
Call Trump because she was helping George Lucas

1155
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:07,391
Direct

1156
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:10,975
First one

1157
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:11,999
3 movies

1158
00:59:12,255 --> 00:59:18,399
Video only directed the first Star Wars first Star Wars movie 7

1159
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:21,727
1983

1160
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:26,079
4 years after Star Wars

1161
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:30,431
I don't know why she didn't referee

1162
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:32,991
American Graffiti cuz that's probably is best

1163
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:36,063
Director Empire Strikes Back

1164
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:38,623
No

1165
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:39,903
6 no

1166
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:43,487
It was a something I'm pretty sure it was on the 8th

1167
00:59:48,863 --> 00:59:49,375
Noh8

1168
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:53,215
That's why Harrison Ford is broke

1169
00:59:53,983 --> 00:59:54,495
Little tough

1170
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:55,519
It's a little

1171
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:56,287
Gluten

1172
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:57,567
Red

1173
00:59:57,823 --> 00:59:59,871
Flags pretty much everywhere

1174
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:05,247
So I'll just say it

1175
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:09,599
Any kind of convinced that there may have been like some sort of case for her where it's like

1176
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:11,647
Ocean you put together all of the

1177
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:12,415
These ideas

1178
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:15,487
Well it's one of those interesting

1179
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:18,303
If you go

1180
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:19,071
Sugar website

1181
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:21,119
Dot-com

1182
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:23,679
There's 11 blogger of

1183
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:28,799
Truth about nature it might as well as of her copyright

1184
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:33,151
Copyright for the Matrix 4

1185
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:35,199
And if the date of it

1186
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:36,991
Is July 20th 20

1187
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:42,623
The evolution

1188
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:49,023
I don't want her helming The Matrix 4

1189
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:53,887
Nature of the work is listed as movie

1190
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:56,703
4D movie attraction

1191
01:00:57,215 --> 01:01:00,799
Hologram clone

1192
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:05,663
Lifted and listed as new machines

1193
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:09,503
Just just new version copyright on the Hologram clones which is the new machine

1194
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:11,807
It could be another copyright troll hair

1195
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:16,415
That was from 2010 but cheap

1196
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:17,439
Claims that

1197
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:18,207
She wrote it into

1198
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:21,791
2000 which is fine but legally there's no proof of that

1199
01:01:22,047 --> 01:01:22,559
Until this

1200
01:01:22,815 --> 01:01:23,327
10 Dates

1201
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:27,167
Enter the Matrix

Text

1203
01:01:28,703 --> 01:01:29,727
She is copyrighted

1204
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:31,519
Is from 2015

1205
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:32,799
But you claim

1206
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:33,823
Big Data

1207
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:34,591

1208
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:35,871
Was 1981

1209
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:38,943
That's just based on her own reporting in this

1210
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:40,735
Basically an affidavit

1211
01:01:40,991 --> 01:01:42,015
Copyright

1212
01:01:42,271 --> 01:01:45,343
Famously published author in night

1213
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:47,391
I assume everybody

1214
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:48,415
We can trust that

1215
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:49,439
She was riding

1216
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:50,207
Soul Man

1217
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:51,231

1218

Scraps in

1219
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:53,535
Screenplays

1220
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:55,583
There's just no way that you couldn't

1221
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:57,375
Credit Acceptance

1222
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:00,959
I just don't

1223
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:01,983
Sorry

1224
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:04,799
I don't believe any of this

1225
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:05,823
It interesting

1226
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:10,943
Because Terry was talking about how like

1227
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:12,735
Hey you know what

1228
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:13,503
LogMeIn

1229
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:17,343
People I've been brainwashed a lot of my sources have been brainwashed

1230
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:20,415
Because they lied and Liars that's

1231
01:02:21,439 --> 01:02:23,999
Another thing that you was really trying to stress

1232
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:25,023
Is that like

1233
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:28,351
Just because I have someone on doesn't mean I agree with them

1234
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:30,399
Sometimes I'm trying to

1235
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:33,215
Cuz I'm

1236
01:02:33,471 --> 01:02:35,519
I'm an investigator

1237
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:37,823
Because she's like you know any page

1238
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:40,895
We can have a conversation and I believe him

1239
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:44,991
It's clipped

1240
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:47,295
She's Not Just investigating

1241
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:48,575
She 100%

1242
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:52,159
No it's kind of funny you know it's it's it's

1243
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:55,999
A lot of people have had their stuff okay

1244
01:02:56,255 --> 01:03:01,375
And what years is one of the most outrageous story of flagrant

1245
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:02,399
Cases

1246
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:03,423
Okay

1247
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:08,031
Copyright violation

1248
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:10,847
She is out well I hope could it not be

1249
01:03:12,127 --> 01:03:14,687
The single largest court case in history

1250
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:17,503
Utah court

1251
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:23,903
To award her 3.5 billion to live here

1252
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:27,231
Because

1253
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:28,255
I would guess

1254
01:03:28,511 --> 01:03:30,559
They would try and appeal that

1255
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:33,375
Just lose the case and be like

1256
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:37,983
3.5 billion Ono we got leaked

1257
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:42,591
To keep the other one point five billion that we

1258
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:46,175
Recognize

1259
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:48,735
Is that like at the end of the day

1260
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:51,295
Even though the Matrix is a Mastiff

1261
01:03:51,807 --> 01:03:52,319
Successful

1262
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:53,087
Franchise

1263
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:54,879
That doesn't mean that it made a lot of

1264
01:03:56,159 --> 01:03:59,231
It doesn't necessarily mean because of all the money that went into it

1265
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:02,815
Right there is still a decent chance that they barely broke

1266
01:04:03,327 --> 01:04:04,351
No they

1267
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:06,911
Well I don't know

1268
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:07,679
But

1269
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:10,239
Would you always assume that like

1270
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:12,287
80 million at the box office

1271
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:13,567
You might have paid

1272
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:20,223
80 million

1273
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:24,319
People talk about budget

1274
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:27,135
Figures that are included online

1275
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:28,671
IMDb

1276
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:30,463
Often don't include

1277
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:31,231
Advertise

1278
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:33,791
Saving budget

1279
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:35,327
Extra expenses that are on there

1280
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:38,655
I'm not necessarily these movies didn't make money

1281
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:41,215
But the figures that you assumed about them the picture

1282
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:41,983
Team billion

1283
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:43,007
Stuff like that

1284
01:04:43,263 --> 01:04:44,287
He's probably grossly

1285
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:45,567
Exaggerate

1286
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:52,223
Was fairly low budget and it had very little effort

1287
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:52,991
Why everybody was

1288
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:54,015
Surprised

1289
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:57,343
Read the release the first Matrix

1290
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:58,879
Has been wildly pop

1291
01:04:59,391 --> 01:05:02,975
I know you got to have that

1292
01:05:03,743 --> 01:05:04,255
Next

1293
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:06,047
Merchandising

1294
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:11,167
Figure out

1295
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:13,215
Stuff ends up making money for like

1296
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:14,751
Hico the paint company

1297
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:19,871
Dartmouth clearly all going

1298
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:20,639
Go to the witch house

1299
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:30,367
Filmmaking and all this stuff is a lot more,

1300
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:37,023
Is it

1301
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:39,071
Sophia Stewart is far from the only person

1302
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:41,119
Do Warner Brothers and Joel Silver

1303
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:42,911
Claimed

1304
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:45,727
Fanaticism

1305
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:47,007
Inspired by movies

1306
01:05:49,311 --> 01:05:50,079
Super ever created

1307
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:53,407
One such fellow lived with a guy named Thomas

1308
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:56,479
Who claimed his screenplay The Immortals had 190

1309
01:05:56,735 --> 01:05:57,759
Similarities

1310
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:05,183
Probably not

1311
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:07,231
Repeat

1312
01:06:07,487 --> 01:06:09,023
Netflix jump

1313
01:06:10,047 --> 01:06:13,631
So this case went to court and the judge

1314
01:06:14,399 --> 01:06:20,543
Immortals

1315
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:21,567
Immortal

1316
01:06:21,823 --> 01:06:25,151
Jim Reese finds himself in the year 2235 18

1317
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:27,199
Excuse me

1318
01:06:27,455 --> 01:06:33,599
3580 battling to wreck the plot of Adolf Hitler's son

1319
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:39,999
Excuses excuses I would like you to pay the difference

1320
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:44,863
Frankly I want you to pay the cost of me being here to death Subs

1321
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:45,631
Pensively differin

1322
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:52,031
Eastlake nature of Neo I was similar to

1323
01:06:53,311 --> 01:06:56,127
Character

1324
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:57,407
Picture of Christ

1325
01:06:57,663 --> 01:07:02,271
To which judge Plus nursing

1326
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:04,319
Christianity

1327
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:06,111
That are not generally protect

1328
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:09,439
Interesting Leo houses

1329
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:11,999
They both claimed that they

1330
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:14,559
Dora Brothers silver stolen

1331
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:16,095
And pass it on to the Wachowski

1332
01:07:16,351 --> 01:07:19,679
This makes absolutely no sense

1333
01:07:20,191 --> 01:07:22,239
Because before the Matrix the wachowskis were not

1334
01:07:22,495 --> 01:07:24,031
Store folks the movie companies would be

1335
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:25,823
Be committing crimes to bolster

1336
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:28,383
Before the Matrix the only two movies they made with

1337
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:29,151
Unforgettable movie

1338
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:29,919
Assassin

1339
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:30,687
Supposed to

Haven't actually written out all of their country

1344
01:07:41,695 --> 01:07:45,279
The sexy Noir crime film starring Jennifer Tilly and Gina Gershon

1345
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:47,327
The movie at the box office

1346
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:48,607

4.5 million-dollar bus

1348
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:52,191

1355
01:08:06,783 --> 01:08:08,319
Responsible

1356
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:09,087
Set them up to 6

1357
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:11,135
They work like somebody

1358
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:13,951
They weren't a team that was like oh my God we've got a

1359
01:08:14,207 --> 01:08:14,975
We got a f***

1360

Absolutely ludicrous dude it's due the 3rd be this

1361
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:23,935
Puracy in order to get them these intellectual property that have been stolen

1362
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:25,215

1363
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:26,239

Frankly

1366
01:08:31,615 --> 01:08:37,759
I still don't Verity

1367
01:08:38,527 --> 01:08:40,319
Well I mean crimes committed

1368
01:08:42,623 --> 01:08:43,391

Melbourne

1370
01:08:45,951 --> 01:08:46,463
Interview

1371
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:47,231
Takes a bit of a turn

1372
01:08:48,255 --> 01:08:49,535
Sofia is about to

1373
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:50,303
Make a claim

1374
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:56,447
Means that when they come in they're going to arrest all of them

1375
01:08:56,703 --> 01:08:57,727
People

1376
01:08:59,007 --> 01:09:00,287
The copyrights

1377
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:05,407
At some point it'll be some kind of task force

1378
01:09:07,967 --> 01:09:10,271
To come in and do this type of work

1379
01:09:10,527 --> 01:09:12,575
Especially when it's a conflict of interest

1380
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:18,463
Make these arrests

1381
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:19,999
And then you would only get rest

1382
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:21,791
They told me because

1383
01:09:22,303 --> 01:09:24,351

What what would the task force

1388
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:34,847
Like you got to swap

1389
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:36,639
Right everybody knows

1390
01:09:36,895 --> 01:09:39,711
They are highly militarized probably

1391
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:40,991
Two military special weapon

1393
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:44,575
So your tax

1394
01:09:44,831 --> 01:09:46,367
Force though for a

1395
01:09:48,671 --> 01:09:49,183
Rico

1396
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:50,207
Scituate

1397
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:51,999
What do they look like

1398
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:57,375
Justice swimsuits

1399
01:09:57,631 --> 01:10:01,215

You got to come in you're going to come in like office you got to come in like

1401
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:06,847
Hey

1402
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:08,895
Bunch of tourists we just wanted

1403
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:14,271
Universal Studios Rico Suave

1404
01:10:14,527 --> 01:10:16,575
Does shirts

1405
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:20,415
Rico Suave

1406
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:25,535
Now we find out something we all probably should have assumed about carry law

1407
01:10:26,303 --> 01:10:32,447
Because you know I worked in Hollywood right you know I was not actually wrote screenplays I tried to

1408
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:33,471
Shop around

1409
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:37,055
I met lie these players you talk about

1410
01:10:37,311 --> 01:10:42,687
Is the case with all of these people

1411
01:10:43,711 --> 01:10:44,223
Weird

1412
01:10:44,735 --> 01:10:46,015
It's really weird

1413
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:52,415
Scary mystery

1414
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:54,975
Why not that would make more

1415
01:10:55,487 --> 01:10:57,535
Well it would make as much sense you would lose

1416
01:10:57,791 --> 01:11:01,887
Where is with a cold

1417
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:10,079
Was trying to break into Hollywood obviously didn't work out cuz where we are now

1418
01:11:10,335 --> 01:11:10,847
She wants you to know

1419
01:11:12,639 --> 01:11:13,407
I worked

1420
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:19,807
Yeah pretty deep in many years and they never would let me in

1421
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:24,159
But I was quite psychic and I tapped into in her lot of got lost

1422
01:11:24,415 --> 01:11:26,463
And whatnot so I know a lot of the story

1423
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:27,231
Faction

1424
01:11:28,767 --> 01:11:31,071
I can tell you that

1425
01:11:31,327 --> 01:11:36,447
What went on with your screenplay with your book in your ear riding

1426
01:11:36,703 --> 01:11:38,495
Some people knew

1427
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:40,031
That's dangerous

1428
01:11:40,799 --> 01:11:44,895
That's a dangerous lying to be taken with someone who is clearly

1429
01:11:46,943 --> 01:11:48,991
Is Sophia Stewart clearly is

1430
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:51,039
You know if she's willing to post

1431
01:11:51,295 --> 01:11:51,807
These

1432
01:11:52,063 --> 01:11:54,879
Like these court documents prove that you

1433
01:11:55,135 --> 01:11:55,903
He's wrong

1434
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:57,951
There's an element of delusion into

1435
01:11:58,207 --> 01:12:02,559
She's putting out to the world I worked in Hollywood I was in deep

1436
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:08,959
Not really in that I was psychic and I heard gossip

1437
01:12:09,215 --> 01:12:12,799
Play the gossip part

1438
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:15,615
I heard gossip

1439
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:17,151
I heard Dokken

1440
01:12:17,407 --> 01:12:23,551
If you are going to gossip definitely don't gossip about a second person who can f****** remote-view you while you're

1441
01:12:23,807 --> 01:12:26,879
She knows if the stuff is Sophia thing or

1442
01:12:27,391 --> 01:12:28,159
Because she's

1443
01:12:29,183 --> 01:12:29,951
Just throw out whole lot

1444
01:12:30,463 --> 01:12:31,487
How do you say

1445
01:12:33,535 --> 01:12:39,423
The other part

1446
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:41,727
Like you were psychic

1447
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:43,519
Chicken more like somebody was like

1448
01:12:43,775 --> 01:12:44,287
Okay

1449
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:45,055
I'm going to be honest with

1450
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:47,871
Find a knock

1451
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:50,687
I saw something on TMZ

1452
01:12:58,111 --> 01:12:59,647
This is not

1453
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:05,023
Like many ideas are stolen maybe not entirely like

1454
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:08,863
Everybody sends in scripts and all that

1455
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:09,887
The rights to them

1456
01:13:10,143 --> 01:13:15,775
Maybe somebody has an idea somebody else right there better script Base outside

1457
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:19,615
People do commercial auditions right

1458
01:13:19,871 --> 01:13:23,199
Sure commercial audition and you'll have a great performance

1459
01:13:23,455 --> 01:13:25,247
Yeah but we don't want you

1460
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:26,783
And what wines of happening is

1461
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:28,063
The guy they do choose

1462
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:30,367
Or the person they do choose

1463
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:33,439
A wind-up feeling imitation of the performance

1464
01:13:33,695 --> 01:13:34,463
That they really like

1465
01:13:37,023 --> 01:13:37,535
It's tough

1466
01:13:38,303 --> 01:13:39,327
But Sophia

1467
01:13:40,351 --> 01:13:42,911
I'd like to know read some of her down

1468
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:47,263
This is an important document

1469
01:13:47,519 --> 01:13:48,799
Hold on

1470
01:13:49,055 --> 01:13:54,943

Deals with the Earth during the year 2110

1473
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:04,415
By that time planet Earth

1474
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:07,999
Experienced a spiritual Evolution was underway

1475
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:10,815
Also man was finally moving from

Spiritual Development

1478
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:18,239
That seems like the reverse of what the Matrix is but find us it seemed apparent that the spirituality Woodson

1479
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:21,567
Prevail over lasting quote-unquote

1480
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:23,615

01:17:10,783 --> 01:17:11,807
Anyting

1527
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:14,879
Remind me of the Matrix so far

1528
01:17:17,695 --> 01:17:18,207
Between them

1529
01:17:18,463 --> 01:17:24,095
Closing into Earth combat

1530
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:31,519
Affected by powers of the third eye

1531
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:42,271
That's really nothing like the Matrix I don't see

1532
01:17:42,527 --> 01:17:45,855
Any similarities

1533
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:47,647
I mean there's a ship in the bay

1534
01:17:52,255 --> 01:17:54,815
You could make sort of a flimsy argument that

1535
01:17:56,095 --> 01:17:57,375
Spiritual in nature

1536
01:17:58,911 --> 01:17:59,423
The stuff in the mail

1537
01:18:00,447 --> 01:18:04,799
Like what Morpheus is trying to impart a spiritual in nature

1538
01:18:05,567 --> 01:18:07,103
It's more of a user manual

1539
01:18:08,127 --> 01:18:11,455
It's not really a spiritual awakening

1540
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:16,063
It might be presented that way you can but it's really not

1541
01:18:17,343 --> 01:18:18,879
No anything but

1542
01:18:19,135 --> 01:18:20,415
Pretty early concrete

1543
01:18:21,183 --> 01:18:23,487
I mean it's

1544
01:18:23,743 --> 01:18:24,255
Infected

1545
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:31,423
Rooted as as those that spiritualism itself is a function of reality as opposed to

1546
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:35,007
Which is a function of

1547
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:37,823
I don't know man

1548
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:39,359
Perpich.

1549
01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:41,407
Ronaldo

1550
01:18:48,831 --> 01:18:49,599
We all are

1551
01:18:49,855 --> 01:18:50,623
Carmatic

1552
01:18:51,391 --> 01:18:53,183
Let's pair button

1553
01:18:54,207 --> 01:18:54,719
Mixquic

1554
01:18:54,975 --> 01:18:55,999
She might slander

1555
01:18:59,583 --> 01:19:00,351
God

1556
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:02,655
And I did pray to God and he

1557
01:19:02,911 --> 01:19:03,423
He told me what

1558
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:05,983
Right and I wrote that she and I didn't know

1559
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:11,615
Becoming a judge

1560
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:14,687
Attorney named Larry long

1561
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:16,735
Call me up with a witness

1562
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:19,551
On the phone and he was laughing

1563
01:19:20,063 --> 01:19:22,367
Greenville evaporation he asked me how did you

1564
01:19:22,623 --> 01:19:23,647
No I said what

1565
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:27,999
Suck my Johnson

1566
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:31,327
God told me

1567
01:19:32,095 --> 01:19:33,887
And I wrote it in a legal phrase

1568
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:43,871
Top

1569
01:19:44,127 --> 01:19:47,455
With no evidence God just told her that was

1570
01:19:50,271 --> 01:19:54,111
I'm starting to think that she stole the copyright from god and goddess

1571
01:19:54,367 --> 01:19:55,135
To be awarded

1572
01:19:55,903 --> 01:19:57,695
That's that's my position

1573
01:19:58,207 --> 01:19:59,231
I feel like there's no way to

1574
01:19:59,487 --> 01:19:59,999
Need that outing

1575
01:20:01,791 --> 01:20:02,559
Really shouldn't

1576
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:08,447
Look I don't know a lot about you

1577
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:15,104
But I'm going to guess they are immediately going to be far more hostile to your case it might prejudice

1578
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:16,896
Gorgeous

1579
01:20:17,152 --> 01:20:19,456
By the way no matter what you do

1580
01:20:22,272 --> 01:20:24,064
Because you blew a lot of guys to get

1581
01:20:27,648 --> 01:20:30,976
I would like to court my prayers

1582
01:20:36,864 --> 01:20:43,008
It's written it's also very strange that God told me the thing that I thought before I ask is weird

1583
01:20:43,264 --> 01:20:49,408
But what I'm getting Petty as hell

1584
01:20:54,784 --> 01:20:57,856
I think at this point remember when Elijah was like

1585
01:20:59,904 --> 01:21:00,672
Too many dicks

1586
01:21:00,928 --> 01:21:01,440
Getting sucked

1587
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:04,512
I think they were pretty much done with her

1588
01:21:04,768 --> 01:21:05,280
Matrix

1589
01:21:05,536 --> 01:21:06,048
Talkative

1590
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:07,072
Terminator 2

1591
01:21:13,216 --> 01:21:18,336
I'm not going to say that I could be a lawyer and

1592
01:21:18,592 --> 01:21:20,384
Walk through this

1593
01:21:20,896 --> 01:21:23,456
But for a podcast I think I've pretty well laid out what the deal is

1594
01:21:24,992 --> 01:21:26,272
Everything is the episode

1595
01:21:26,528 --> 01:21:27,296
It doesn't end

1596
01:21:27,808 --> 01:21:28,832
Lake Harriet

1597
01:21:29,088 --> 01:21:29,600
Seems like

1598
01:21:29,856 --> 01:21:34,976
That's why she's there

1599
01:21:35,744 --> 01:21:37,280
Is as the chocolate

1600
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:38,816
About

1601
01:21:39,072 --> 01:21:39,840
The Matrix.

1602
01:21:40,352 --> 01:21:41,632
It becomes more

1603
01:21:41,888 --> 01:21:44,704
Clear why I don't believe her about the Matrix

1604
01:21:45,472 --> 01:21:47,264
Because she starts to get real wacky

1605
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:49,312
Is it because she tries to

1606
01:21:49,568 --> 01:21:52,128
Describe the plot of The Matrix and gets it wrong

1607
01:21:52,384 --> 01:21:58,016
No that would be amazing though

1608
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:04,416
Illuminati told me and this year 2016 the Mason

1609
01:22:04,928 --> 01:22:05,696
Illuminati

1610
01:22:05,952 --> 01:22:06,720
Wake me up

1611
01:22:07,232 --> 01:22:10,560
And the Rothschild

1612
01:22:10,816 --> 01:22:12,352
And the Matrix and Terminator

1613
01:22:12,864 --> 01:22:19,008
That guy would have a second walkthrough that I would win that lawsuit

1614
01:22:19,264 --> 01:22:22,080
Then I would play a major role in world events

1615
01:22:28,736 --> 01:22:31,040
Before I even initiated a second lawsuit

1616
01:22:32,832 --> 01:22:33,600
All right.

1617
01:22:33,856 --> 01:22:37,696
They already know what's going to happen I'm telling you the Illuminati

1618
01:22:37,952 --> 01:22:40,256
They know what's written in

1619
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:44,352
They know what's going to happen and everything at so what I'm trying

1620
01:22:44,608 --> 01:22:45,888
Say to you is that

1621
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:49,216
Did everything in their power

1622
01:22:49,984 --> 01:22:56,128
Put Hillary in there because they were going to get everything the same with Hillary

1623
01:22:56,384 --> 01:22:59,456
Usual getting away with everything

1624
01:22:59,968 --> 01:23:02,528
They knew that Trump trump it was part

1625
01:23:02,784 --> 01:23:04,064
Chocolate part of the

1626
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:05,088
Wow

1627
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:07,136
Famous like a trumpet

1628
01:23:07,392 --> 01:23:09,696
Oh f***

1629
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:10,976
Railroad

1630
01:23:11,232 --> 01:23:16,352
What are the creator of The Matrix

1631
01:23:19,424 --> 01:23:25,056
Illuminati

1632
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:37,344
Praying to God about this horror who is pissed off

1633
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:42,976
Night shift

1634
01:23:46,048 --> 01:23:47,328
From her point of ripe

1635
01:23:47,584 --> 01:23:48,096
Not

1636
01:23:48,352 --> 01:23:50,144
Sex worker.

1637
01:23:52,704 --> 01:23:53,216
I'm not trying to be

1638
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:08,832
Okay hold on let me know

1639
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:11,136
Better turn around

1640
01:24:11,904 --> 01:24:13,184
Important

1641
01:24:14,464 --> 01:24:17,024
Let me start with the classic

1642
01:24:17,536 --> 01:24:19,072
Did anybody here like impressions

1643
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:20,864
Pause for the audience

1644
01:24:23,168 --> 01:24:23,680
Turn around

1645
01:24:29,056 --> 01:24:31,360
Petzl rotometrics right

1646
01:24:32,896 --> 01:24:35,968
I just heard him say I did

1647
01:24:37,248 --> 01:24:43,392
God dammit you told me I was not going to win the first lawsuit I don't even know why I fight so that wasn't that

1648
01:24:43,648 --> 01:24:46,208
Illuminati

1649
01:24:46,464 --> 01:24:47,232
Wind

1650
01:24:51,072 --> 01:24:55,936
The first song

1651
01:24:59,776 --> 01:25:01,056
Give the so much

1652
01:25:01,312 --> 01:25:03,360
Jesse legitimately

1653
01:25:04,384 --> 01:25:05,920
We got to work out our relationship

1654
01:25:06,176 --> 01:25:07,200
It was God

1655
01:25:10,784 --> 01:25:14,880
What could the Illuminati wanted Hillary to get in because then they can keep doing their dirt

1656
01:25:24,352 --> 01:25:26,144
Sino somehow I'm fine with that

1657
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:29,472
Well it's for project

1658
01:25:29,728 --> 01:25:31,776
Taylor and that's why Trump

1659
01:25:33,568 --> 01:25:34,848
Superman

1660
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:39,968
There is a

1661
01:25:40,224 --> 01:25:40,992
Familiarity with

1662
01:25:41,248 --> 01:25:42,528
Trump did a lot of these like

1663
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:44,320
I started to think about

1664
01:25:45,856 --> 01:25:47,648
The peeling across so many weird

1665
01:25:47,904 --> 01:25:48,416
Disparate

1666
01:25:48,672 --> 01:25:50,976
Because with Alex

1667
01:25:51,232 --> 01:25:51,744
I think it's

1668
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:52,512
Like

1669
01:25:52,768 --> 01:25:56,096
You know his business model largely relies on

1670
01:25:56,352 --> 01:25:57,120
The deregulation

1671
01:26:03,008 --> 01:26:06,592
If you want to take from that level on a craftsman

1672
01:26:06,848 --> 01:26:07,616
Materialistic level

1673
01:26:07,872 --> 01:26:09,152
You could make the argument

1674
01:26:09,408 --> 01:26:10,432
Decided was truck because

1675
01:26:10,688 --> 01:26:11,200
Cuz you realized

1676
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:14,272
Democrats power again

1677
01:26:14,528 --> 01:26:16,320
That there would be trimmed towards

1678
01:26:16,576 --> 01:26:17,088
Putting

1679
01:26:17,344 --> 01:26:18,624
Restrictions on Lotto

1680
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:21,440
The things that would make his Empire crumble

1681
01:26:21,696 --> 01:26:26,048
This this billion-dollar unregulated industry of selling snake oil

1682
01:26:26,304 --> 01:26:27,328
Maybe they might regular

1683
01:26:27,584 --> 01:26:30,656
Possibility or you can look at it from the angle of life

1684
01:26:30,912 --> 01:26:32,704
It's very clear that Trump has been a white

1685
01:26:33,216 --> 01:26:35,520
Forever and ever

1686
01:26:41,664 --> 01:26:42,176
6 wood

1687
01:26:42,432 --> 01:26:42,944
Joy.

1688
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:44,480
Superhumans kind of America

1689
01:26:44,736 --> 01:26:45,760
Territory

1690
01:26:46,016 --> 01:26:47,552
You start to look at people like

1691
01:26:50,624 --> 01:26:51,648
Yeah

1692
01:26:51,904 --> 01:26:53,440
She's crazy right

1693
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,560
Somebody says I'm going to release all the

1694
01:26:59,072 --> 01:26:59,840
He's f******.

1695
01:27:01,376 --> 01:27:02,912
But he keeps

1696
01:27:05,984 --> 01:27:07,520
And that gets you like hairy chest

1697
01:27:07,776 --> 01:27:09,568
Who believe that there's some sort of

1698
01:27:09,824 --> 01:27:12,896
Nefarious

1699
01:27:13,152 --> 01:27:13,664
The Deep state

1700
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:14,688
That resonates

1701
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:15,712
Cassidy

1702
01:27:15,968 --> 01:27:16,736
Paranoid

1703
01:27:16,992 --> 01:27:18,528
Right

1704
01:27:18,784 --> 01:27:22,624
Baker Hughes sort of milia that whole world

1705
01:27:23,136 --> 01:27:26,720
One level.

1706
01:27:26,976 --> 01:27:27,488
Being

1707
01:27:29,024 --> 01:27:30,304
Blade to support Trump

1708
01:27:30,816 --> 01:27:32,608
Is because people like Jim Bakker

1709
01:27:32,864 --> 01:27:33,376
And a lot of

1710
01:27:33,632 --> 01:27:35,168
You make money off religion

1711
01:27:35,424 --> 01:27:36,192
Realized

1712
01:27:36,448 --> 01:27:38,752
Is that Trump is going to and have moved

1713
01:27:39,008 --> 01:27:39,520
2

1714
01:27:39,776 --> 01:27:40,288
He's

1715
01:27:40,544 --> 01:27:41,312
The rules

1716
01:27:41,824 --> 01:27:42,592
Churches

1717
01:27:42,848 --> 01:27:44,384
To make money

1718
01:27:45,664 --> 01:27:51,808
Didn't know that the con man is not going to hinder their content

1719
01:27:52,064 --> 01:27:54,112
Bunch of diverse

1720
01:27:55,392 --> 01:27:57,440
There's nothing really bringing all of them

1721
01:27:57,696 --> 01:27:58,720
Together like

1722
01:27:58,976 --> 01:28:01,536
Mortally doesn't seem hyper-conservative

1723
01:28:02,048 --> 01:28:03,840
She doesn't seem like someone I mean

1724
01:28:09,216 --> 01:28:10,752
Political in that way

1725
01:28:11,008 --> 01:28:15,104
She's not on the we need Healthcare trip because

1726
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:16,896
The Trump Administration

1727
01:28:17,408 --> 01:28:22,784
Is going to finally release the Hologram bed then he'll everybody beds

1728
01:28:26,624 --> 01:28:29,440
I think that everybody in different ways

1729
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,024
Being done to them by the

1730
01:28:33,536 --> 01:28:34,560
Makers in The Voice

1731
01:28:34,816 --> 01:28:37,376
People like Alex like Jim Bakker

1732
01:28:38,912 --> 01:28:40,704
Jim Baker's leaving a lot of people astray

1733
01:28:41,216 --> 01:28:43,264
Insinuating the Trump is going to be a blessing

1734
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:44,032
Christian

1735
01:28:44,544 --> 01:28:46,848
He knows that he's business is protected by

1736
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:50,432
Right right

1737
01:28:50,688 --> 01:28:53,248
IRS investigation of Jim Bakker

1738
01:28:53,504 --> 01:28:54,272
Weird

1739
01:28:54,528 --> 01:28:56,320
Yeah as long as Trump's in office

1740
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:57,600
Zoo

1741
01:28:58,112 --> 01:28:58,624
Same thing

1742
01:28:59,392 --> 01:29:00,160
It's weird to me because

1743
01:29:01,696 --> 01:29:02,976
We always want to overcomplicate

1744
01:29:03,488 --> 01:29:04,768
I think it might be

1745
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:08,352
Yeah just a lot of people realize that like

1746
01:29:09,376 --> 01:29:10,400
He is way too busy

1747
01:29:10,656 --> 01:29:11,680
Covering his own ass

1748
01:29:11,936 --> 01:29:13,728
He's never coming back around

1749
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:15,520
He's the kind of fire entry

1750
01:29:16,544 --> 01:29:21,152
Well it's kind of like if you're a kid in school you're at like substitute comes in hungover

1751
01:29:21,664 --> 01:29:23,456
You kind of intuitively know like

1752
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:30,368
This guy is just going to be we're going to watch a movie everybody

1753
01:29:30,624 --> 01:29:36,256
I think we're still drugs right in front of him he's going to be like

1754
01:29:37,792 --> 01:29:38,816
I don't know how much

1755
01:29:40,096 --> 01:29:40,864
Fighting more than

1756
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:43,424
Probably people one egg

1757
01:29:44,192 --> 01:29:47,008
Your theory and I'm not saying

1758
01:29:47,776 --> 01:29:48,544
100%

1759
01:29:50,336 --> 01:29:53,152
If I understand correctly

1760
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:55,200
When the Conners

1761
01:29:55,456 --> 01:29:57,504
Who are used to calling these dump

1762
01:29:57,760 --> 01:29:58,784
Sarah and John

1763
01:29:59,808 --> 01:30:01,600
I can't talk about that

1764
01:30:04,416 --> 01:30:05,440
Wii releases

1765
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:08,000
Realize

1766
01:30:08,512 --> 01:30:10,304
That man was going to be

1767
01:30:10,816 --> 01:30:12,096
They directed all the

1768
01:30:12,352 --> 01:30:13,120
People they were coming

1769
01:30:13,632 --> 01:30:15,168
To support the con man to be present

1770
01:30:15,424 --> 01:30:17,216
Play the con man who knows the

1771
01:30:17,728 --> 01:30:19,520
Is it going to

1772
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:21,824
Which is why

1773
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:25,408
Alex probably hate bush in the other guys

1774
01:30:25,664 --> 01:30:26,688
They're Republican

1775
01:30:26,944 --> 01:30:28,224
But they're not common

1776
01:30:28,736 --> 01:30:30,784
They're just liars and stupid and

1777
01:30:31,552 --> 01:30:32,064
Maybe

1778
01:30:35,648 --> 01:30:37,696
I don't know I think there's much more.

1779
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:39,232
Thought

1780
01:30:39,744 --> 01:30:40,512
Anyway

1781
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:42,048
I told you this is going to be

1782
01:30:42,816 --> 01:30:43,584
And it is next

1783
01:30:44,864 --> 01:30:45,888
Carrie asked Sofia

1784
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:47,424
If she's

1785
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:48,448
Thinking about aliens

1786
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:53,312
No sense

1787
01:30:53,824 --> 01:30:59,712
Are you thinking about the incoming Ary that's basically alien technology

1788
01:31:00,224 --> 01:31:02,528
You know I'm a lie alien AI

1789
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:07,904
Where is your mind going with everything now

1790
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:12,256
Ambidextrous meaning is that I have the same

1791
01:31:12,512 --> 01:31:16,608
Both hands and it means I'm using both lobes of the brain

1792
01:31:17,632 --> 01:31:23,008
Doesn't that I cracked the codes on system so that's why I never

On anything that I do

1797
01:31:35,296 --> 01:31:37,088
Nothing that you can't even imagine

1798
01:31:43,744 --> 01:31:44,256
Hold on

1799
01:31:44,512 --> 01:31:45,024

This made me feel

1803
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:54,752
So worried

1804
01:31:57,056 --> 01:31:59,104
Because it is an instance of like

1805
01:31:59,360 --> 01:31:59,872
I think that

1806
01:32:00,128 --> 01:32:01,152

No clue

1813
01:32:20,096 --> 01:32:21,888

01:37:02,976 --> 01:37:03,744
V

1901
01:37:05,792 --> 01:37:08,352
Share classified information to somebody who's not allowed

1902
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:15,008
She sounded more Alex Jones even I think

1903
01:37:15,264 --> 01:37:17,056
Anybody we've ever heard on

1904
01:37:17,568 --> 01:37:19,616
Project Camelot in that she's like

1905
01:37:20,128 --> 01:37:21,408
She's totally claiming that

1906
01:37:21,664 --> 01:37:22,688
They called her up

1907
01:37:23,712 --> 01:37:24,736
How did you know

1908
01:37:24,992 --> 01:37:27,296
I do like I just reverse engineered it

1909
01:37:27,552 --> 01:37:28,064
Yeah

1910
01:37:29,344 --> 01:37:32,160
She will go into later talking about

1911
01:37:32,416 --> 01:37:33,696
Astrally time travel

1912
01:37:34,976 --> 01:37:40,096
She's able to go to other places and then ask them how their technology works and then come back and

1913
01:37:40,352 --> 01:37:46,240
Alright so she's a butt

1914
01:37:47,008 --> 01:37:48,800
Screenwriters and clearly we know

1915
01:37:49,312 --> 01:37:49,824
They can't

1916
01:37:50,336 --> 01:37:51,360
Because writing is X

1917
01:37:51,616 --> 01:37:52,128
Actually hard

1918
01:37:52,384 --> 01:37:53,152
And dialogue isn't

1919
01:37:53,408 --> 01:37:53,920
Yeah yeah

1920
01:37:54,176 --> 01:37:55,712
They're not good with that

1921
01:37:55,968 --> 01:37:57,504
Knock

1922
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:02,880
Being writers rooms

1923
01:38:03,136 --> 01:38:08,000
Just like throwing out if you put them near a whiteboard

1924
01:38:08,256 --> 01:38:09,280
You're going to get something

1925
01:38:09,536 --> 01:38:15,680
If you are in a writers room in your trying to write like Black Mirror episodes if you if you have Leo zagami

1926
01:38:15,936 --> 01:38:17,728
Me in there and just tell her to shut up

1927
01:38:17,984 --> 01:38:19,264
Unless he's Pope

1928
01:38:19,776 --> 01:38:25,920
You headed we don't need your help when it comes to the actual

1929
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:31,808
But I don't know where

1930
01:38:33,344 --> 01:38:36,416
Smart idea

1931
01:38:43,328 --> 01:38:46,656
What Pokemon can just say that it's a nice

1932
01:38:52,288 --> 01:38:56,384
But you notice

1933
01:38:56,640 --> 01:38:57,664
Recognizing earlier that

1934
01:38:57,920 --> 01:38:58,944
She seems that a lot of dates

1935
01:38:59,456 --> 01:39:01,504
And then what you talked about the Roswell thing

1936
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:03,552
National Security agent

1937
01:39:03,808 --> 01:39:04,832
He called me some year

1938
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:10,976
They called me pure

1939
01:39:11,232 --> 01:39:14,304
Is a few specific date

1940
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:15,584
I'm going to go later

1941
01:39:16,096 --> 01:39:19,680
Many moons ago so she hasn't had

1942
01:39:19,936 --> 01:39:20,448
Contact

1943
01:39:21,216 --> 01:39:21,728
Yeah

1944
01:39:22,240 --> 01:39:27,104
Let's see up there was some another question I saw in here someone wants to know

1945
01:39:27,616 --> 01:39:33,760
Have you been basically do you feel that you've been contacted by aliens abducted

1946
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:37,856
Well I'ma say this

1947
01:39:38,112 --> 01:39:44,256
Why was writing the Matrix and Terminator and 1980s dream where I saw

1948
01:39:44,512 --> 01:39:45,536
The shift

1949
01:39:45,792 --> 01:39:47,328
You saw in The Matrix

1950
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:50,400
Significant Azurite saw the ship

1951
01:39:51,424 --> 01:39:51,936
In a dream

1952
01:39:52,192 --> 01:39:56,032
But I didn't know that the ship was an alien ship and chill

1953
01:39:56,288 --> 01:39:58,080
Homeland it wasn't contact

1954
01:39:58,336 --> 01:40:00,640
Me in 2010 or 2011

1955
01:40:00,896 --> 01:40:02,688
Set me over

1956
01:40:02,944 --> 01:40:06,528
The Pentagon is a picture of the ship why

1957
01:40:06,784 --> 01:40:11,392
Which I will give to anybody when they give the Matrix 4450 give you the All Blacks

1958
01:40:11,648 --> 01:40:12,160
Security

1959
01:40:12,416 --> 01:40:14,720
Pentagon information it's real

1960
01:40:14,976 --> 01:40:19,328
I think that's illegal

1961
01:40:19,584 --> 01:40:20,864
Illegal but it's not

1962
01:40:21,376 --> 01:40:23,168
Mark of her sort of

1963
01:40:23,424 --> 01:40:27,776
Technique I've read interviews interviews but I've read pieces of people have written about it

1964
01:40:28,544 --> 01:40:31,616
And oftentimes to brickwall whatever you ask for evidence

1965
01:40:32,128 --> 01:40:33,664
Bhsa like bye-bye book

1966
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:36,992
Can you can get it it's just intended to sell the book

1967
01:40:37,504 --> 01:40:39,296
Carrot that use dangling out in front of it

1968
01:40:39,552 --> 01:40:43,136
Secret Pentagon pictures of the Nebuchadnezzar that proves that my book is that

1969
01:40:43,392 --> 01:40:43,904
Actually

1970
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:45,440
Blah blah blah

1971
01:40:45,952 --> 01:40:46,720
I respect the hustle

1972
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:52,864
Because you're old

1973
01:40:53,376 --> 01:40:54,400
2

1974
01:40:54,656 --> 01:41:00,800
Because it's a good group of people to hustle or hopeful

1975
01:41:01,824 --> 01:41:05,152
People really not hard but any any halfway right

1976
01:41:05,408 --> 01:41:06,176
Person with here like

1977
01:41:06,432 --> 01:41:08,480
Oh I buy your book

1978
01:41:08,992 --> 01:41:09,760
Integon documents

1979
01:41:10,528 --> 01:41:11,808
Yeah we have f****** right

1980
01:41:12,064 --> 01:41:12,576
A dozen

1981
01:41:14,368 --> 01:41:14,880
So

1982
01:41:15,392 --> 01:41:16,160
I have I have

1983
01:41:16,672 --> 01:41:17,184
1

1984
01:41:17,696 --> 01:41:18,208
Huge pet peeve

1985
01:41:23,072 --> 01:41:23,584
Like

1986
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:28,448
All of all of those little thrown into Ark

1987
01:41:29,728 --> 01:41:30,752
I even though they're not

1988
01:41:31,264 --> 01:41:32,800
There for any reason

1989
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:34,848
The one word

1990
01:41:37,664 --> 01:41:38,944
Basically what's going on

1991
01:41:39,968 --> 01:41:42,784
Yeah removes kind of

1992
01:41:43,296 --> 01:41:45,088
Attempt to sound smarter while using

1993
01:41:46,624 --> 01:41:50,464
I'm boiling this down to the particular

1994
01:41:50,720 --> 01:41:52,000
For you when in reality

1995
01:41:52,512 --> 01:41:53,024
You are absolute

1996
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:54,560
Dodging

1997
01:41:57,120 --> 01:41:58,144
Cuz

1998
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:07,616
Let's do you feel that you're what I would call a precog see the future

1999
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:14,016
The Oracle was created after me being a visionary

2000
01:42:15,552 --> 01:42:19,648
She's the Oracle not only

2001
01:42:23,744 --> 01:42:26,816
James Cameron laundry list

2002
01:42:27,072 --> 01:42:29,632
But you should go after

2003
01:42:30,144 --> 01:42:31,168
Just about everybody

2004
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:32,192
Socrates

2005
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:37,568
Oracle in The Matrix

2006
01:42:42,432 --> 01:42:43,712
She Wrote This vaguely

2007
01:42:44,736 --> 01:42:45,504
Treatment

2008
01:42:46,016 --> 01:42:47,296
Early 80s

2009
01:42:50,624 --> 01:42:52,416
The character of the

2010
01:42:52,672 --> 01:42:53,440
The Oracle is

2011
01:42:53,696 --> 01:42:54,976
Kindly older black lady

2012
01:42:55,488 --> 01:42:57,536
She identified with that character

2013
01:42:58,816 --> 01:42:59,584
Because she's

2014
01:43:00,096 --> 01:43:01,120
A little bit delusional

2015
01:43:01,376 --> 01:43:01,888
Kind of

2016
01:43:02,144 --> 01:43:03,936
Put a bunch together and then was

2017
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:08,800
And then everything went off the rails

2018
01:43:10,848 --> 01:43:12,128
If that's what she identifies

2019
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:13,152
I assumed

2020
01:43:18,272 --> 01:43:22,112
Because that was essentially directly take

2021
01:43:22,368 --> 01:43:22,880
Chicken from

2022
01:43:26,976 --> 01:43:30,304
She doesn't know about the sources

2023
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:36,704
Actually came from

2024
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:40,032
It's like a it's a it's a great movie

2025
01:43:40,544 --> 01:43:42,336
Because

2026
01:43:42,592 --> 01:43:43,104
Like we said

2027
01:43:44,384 --> 01:43:45,152
The beginning of this episode

2028
01:43:45,408 --> 01:43:47,200
One of the reasons that it's so

2029
01:43:48,992 --> 01:43:50,528
Mixable with other things

2030
01:43:50,784 --> 01:43:51,552
Because it's so base

2031
01:43:52,064 --> 01:43:53,344
You know I had such

2032
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:54,624
Archetypal

2033
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:55,904
Imagery

2034
01:43:56,160 --> 01:43:57,440
And storytelling

2035
01:43:58,976 --> 01:43:59,744
Is it took this

2036
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,280
Very simple

2037
01:44:01,792 --> 01:44:03,072
Universal story

2038
01:44:03,328 --> 01:44:05,632
He put it into a weird sci-fi

2039
01:44:05,888 --> 01:44:06,656
Cyber

2040
01:44:06,912 --> 01:44:07,424
Punk

2041
01:44:07,936 --> 01:44:08,448
Aesthetic

2042
01:44:08,704 --> 01:44:09,728
And then serve

2043
01:44:09,984 --> 01:44:12,032
What is a proof-of-concept of

2044
01:44:12,544 --> 01:44:14,080
Slightly stolen verse

2045
01:44:14,592 --> 01:44:15,104
Filmmaker

2046
01:44:15,360 --> 01:44:17,408
Time stop

2047
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:18,688
Be the interest

2048
01:44:22,784 --> 01:44:26,112
It was like a stolen from Curacao

2049
01:44:27,904 --> 01:44:28,416
Get it

2050
01:44:28,928 --> 01:44:30,720
It's tough to come up with ideas

2051
01:44:30,976 --> 01:44:33,280
Originally

2052
01:44:35,584 --> 01:44:39,936
People didn't come up with the heroes

2053
01:44:40,448 --> 01:44:41,216
Describe

2054
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:44,544
Describe are you sure

2055
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:49,664
I mean 84 somebody who is

2056
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:50,432
Greek

2057
01:44:50,688 --> 01:44:51,968
I have no idea

2058
01:44:52,224 --> 01:44:55,296
How it is possible for you to know where archetypes

2059
01:44:55,552 --> 01:44:56,064
Come from

2060
01:44:59,392 --> 01:44:59,904
But anyway

2061
01:45:00,416 --> 01:45:01,184
Play One Last Cry

2062
01:45:01,696 --> 01:45:04,512
What are the things that ties all of these

2063
01:45:05,024 --> 01:45:05,792
Disparate worlds of

2064
01:45:06,048 --> 01:45:06,560
Of calling people

2065
01:45:07,584 --> 01:45:08,608
Weather

2066
01:45:09,120 --> 01:45:10,144
Whether it's Alex Jones

2067
01:45:10,656 --> 01:45:11,936
Whether it's Project Camelot

2068
01:45:12,192 --> 01:45:12,704
It's a lack of

2069
01:45:13,472 --> 01:45:15,264
They're all afraid of CERN

2070
01:45:15,776 --> 01:45:19,616
Using

2071
01:45:20,896 --> 01:45:23,200
Create different weather patterns

2072
01:45:23,456 --> 01:45:23,968
Later

2073
01:45:24,224 --> 01:45:26,784
Indigenous people that lady's butt using

2074
01:45:27,296 --> 01:45:28,576
618

2075
01:45:28,832 --> 01:45:32,160
Dance with the rain the rain soundtrack

2076
01:45:32,416 --> 01:45:35,232
Xbox arranged oz of water

2077
01:45:36,256 --> 01:45:37,280
When it had a drought

2078
01:45:37,792 --> 01:45:38,560
Grow plantain

2079
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:42,400
But these people are using the CERN

2080
01:45:42,656 --> 01:45:43,424
Troy

2081
01:45:44,192 --> 01:45:45,984
People so they can bring

2082
01:45:46,240 --> 01:45:47,264
Wealthy ocean

2083
01:45:48,544 --> 01:45:49,568
Call Kaiser

2084
01:45:53,152 --> 01:45:57,504
They wanted they wanted Hades they wanted Puerto Rico they wanted Cuba

2085
01:45:57,760 --> 01:45:59,040
Search for Dale Dye

2086
01:45:59,808 --> 01:46:03,136
But you know what was holding them back on Vudu

2087
01:46:03,648 --> 01:46:05,952
And hate are in Haiti

2088
01:46:06,464 --> 01:46:07,744
Akubra

2089
01:46:13,632 --> 01:46:14,144
Vudu

2090
01:46:14,656 --> 01:46:18,240
Okay couldn't get around the voodoo

2091
01:46:19,264 --> 01:46:21,056
Swear to God I say that on a daily basis

2092
01:46:21,312 --> 01:46:26,944
Getaround even in that clip the carries like

2093
01:46:34,368 --> 01:46:40,512
I'm a remote viewer I don't know what's going on the moon

2094
01:46:41,024 --> 01:46:42,816
It's such as such

2095
01:46:44,096 --> 01:46:45,632
It's amazing that are thirsty

2096
01:46:45,888 --> 01:46:46,912
Clark's quote

2097
01:46:47,168 --> 01:46:48,448
Any technology

2098
01:46:48,704 --> 01:46:49,984
Indistinguishable from Magic

2099
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:52,032
It's a

2100
01:46:52,288 --> 01:46:52,800
Frustrating

2101
01:46:53,056 --> 01:46:53,824
Truth that that is

2102
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:55,360
True even when the

2103
01:46:55,616 --> 01:46:56,128
Technology

2104
01:46:56,384 --> 01:46:57,664
Is explainable

2105
01:46:57,920 --> 01:46:59,712
Right like it's not Magic

2106
01:47:02,784 --> 01:47:03,296
Do a weather.

2107
01:47:03,552 --> 01:47:04,576
Noah

2108
01:47:04,832 --> 01:47:06,112
Also

2109
01:47:06,368 --> 01:47:12,512
So whether dances are real silver what is just a big

2110
01:47:12,768 --> 01:47:16,096
Eva weather today

2111
01:47:16,352 --> 01:47:18,400
Puerto Rico

2112
01:47:18,656 --> 01:47:23,776
They wanted to take Fidel.

2113
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:25,824
Ulcers

2114
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:30,688
She goes on to ramble about like Louisiana New Orleans

2115
01:47:30,944 --> 01:47:36,064
No that's true evil weather weapons and

2116
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:39,904
Being very strong against these weather weapon

2117
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:41,184
The voodoo is strong with

2118
01:47:41,696 --> 01:47:45,792
Hurricane

2119
01:47:46,048 --> 01:47:47,840
Most

2120
01:47:50,144 --> 01:47:56,288
So I can get around the voodoo eventually that argument flawed if your argument is that

2121
01:47:56,544 --> 01:47:58,080
Vudu

2122
01:47:58,336 --> 01:48:01,664
Voodoo negates weather weapons

2123
01:48:03,456 --> 01:48:07,552
You got to get a room

2124
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:13,184
Who wrote The Matrix and Terminator movie

2125
01:48:16,512 --> 01:48:19,328
This is one thing that we can all

2126
01:48:21,888 --> 01:48:23,168
Getaround

2127
01:48:25,984 --> 01:48:27,520
Take it around

2128
01:48:27,776 --> 01:48:29,824
So I think at this point

2129
01:48:30,848 --> 01:48:33,408
Decided

2130
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:39,040
A lot of fun and it was a lot of Alex Jones on Friday

2131
01:48:39,296 --> 01:48:42,368
Sprite.com follow it someplace

2132
01:48:46,976 --> 01:48:48,256
How about if you wanted some

2133
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:51,072
Alright

2134
01:48:51,584 --> 01:48:52,096
What else

2135
01:48:55,936 --> 01:48:56,448
Nope

2136
01:48:56,704 --> 01:48:57,472
You know what though

2137
01:48:57,728 --> 01:49:00,288
On Thursday

2138
01:49:01,312 --> 01:49:07,456
Tomorrow night if you're looking good

2139
01:49:07,968 --> 01:49:10,528
Aurora

2140
01:49:10,784 --> 01:49:12,576
But you know what

2141
01:49:12,832 --> 01:49:13,344
Sophia Stewart

2142
01:49:13,600 --> 01:49:15,136
Lying about

2143
01:49:16,160 --> 01:49:16,928
She's not killed anyone

2144
01:49:17,184 --> 01:49:17,952
Alex Jones

2145
01:49:18,464 --> 01:49:19,488
Probably did kill a dude

2146
01:49:20,512 --> 01:49:22,560
Holding

2147
01:49:24,608 --> 01:49:28,192
