1
00:00:04,864 --> 00:00:08,448
Alex

2
00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:11,008
Everybody welcome back to knowledge

3
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:16,384
About Alex Jones

4
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,344
Got some things that need to be showered about

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:31,744
I got a couple issues.

6
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:43,776
This is officially by scale

7
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:47,616
I think it goes far beyond that but I know a lot about Alex Jones

8
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:48,896
I don't know

9
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:53,504
That's the theme of the show Mountain Dew kickstart

10
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,784
In order

11
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:00,416
The midnight

12
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:06,816
Mystery flavor for the show

13
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:09,376
Don't need to rehash something

14
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:11,680
Fervent

15
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:18,080
Existentialism

16
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:19,616
Flavors it whether or not they are real

17
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:26,016
Write whether or not depict reality or

18
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:28,064
Actually I've already interrupted drink

19
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,952
Anyway

20
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:34,976
If you're nasty

21
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:41,376
The it's a little interesting weird stuff happens and I'm f****** tired of giving that introduction

22
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:47,776
Quite frankly

23
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:50,336
During the 2nd and will complain about this

24
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:54,688
Complaining in order to start us off

25
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:02,624
I should not have phrased it that way that's an actual crime is messy I say playing

26
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,208
Vets

27
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:12,864
From today's episode

28
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:26,432
Hang out with Austin liberals

29
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,200
What a shock

30
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:29,504
What a shock

31
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,368
It's not friends

32
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,648
I'm guessing it

33
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,720
I'm guessing that's what it is

34
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:45,120
People who say they're libertarian

35
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:49,472
Is actually a conservative

36
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:55,360
Cult around a big big old races

37
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:57,152
We believe in love

38
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:59,968
Government oversight in this guy over here thinks

39
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:02,272
Chimeras are real

40
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:03,808
Beeman's

41
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:07,136
You're a liberal I like your stance

42
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:13,536
Yeah

43
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:17,632
A real thrill

44
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:22,240
Tell your brother

45
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:24,032
We appreciate it very much thank you so much

46
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,568
If you'd like to become a

47
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,128
Disappointed

48
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:34,528
When people aren't Global it's like I don't know

49
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:39,136
Ungracious because Mike W f*** yeah thank you so much

50
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,160
Now

51
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:46,560
Raise it up one more set so we get to play only one more sense I'm not sure that

52
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:49,888
Get around the system

53
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:56,288
Globalist position because it's Meredith

54
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:06,016
Don't get mad until your brilliant someone sodomite sent me a bucket of poop

55
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:09,088
Thank you so much

56
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,624
Ronaldo born

57
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,904
I think it's because

58
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:17,280
It suggests that somebody sent him a bag of poop every time

59
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:30,079
Beautiful

60
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:39,295
Do you like sports to show please do go to knowledge buy.com quicksupport the show helps a lot

61

So today Monday

62
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:48,767
Heavy on my heart continues further on

63
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:53,119
But Alex Jones would have you know that actually that is just Trump on doing a

64
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:59,519
Institutional

65
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,359
GameStop

66
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:04,639
I know

67
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:07,199
I get it I get it

68
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:11,039
So what else you got

69
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:19,999
Not s*** like everything is bad like going to win Weebly

70
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:29,471
The people who are pushing this f****** tax bill on Hazard then turning around like f****** Orrin Hatch

71
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:34,079
If somebody could shove something so far up Orrin hatch's ass

72
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,871
It comes straight out through his mouth

73
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:42,271
I'm going to get lit on fire afterwards just like dragons flaming swords

74
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:46,879
Straight up through its own breaker

75
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:50,207
Right

76
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:54,815
And the Democrats are f****** worthless I'm done I'm done they are f****** worth it

77
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:57,375
Freedom speeder got f****** Liberals are p****

78
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:02,751
Let's Liberals are pussies LK

79
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:03,519
Anything

80
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:10,687
Quit what is this is Peyton Manning

81
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:14,015
The strong f****** survive

82
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:19,903
I'm going to Blink three times that I'm being held hostage

83
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:25,279
Alright Jordan

84
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:31,679
Check out his blog on we have about a month left and if we don't all setup and get our

85
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,751
Goddamn

86
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:37,567
Negative

87
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:39,103
It won't fall apart within a

88
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:43,455
We have negative time until what we what we need to have done

89
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:46,783
She's done maybe the problem with the French Revolution that we

90
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:47,551
You can really

91
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,319
Correct

92
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,623
Right is the only chopped off

93
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,671
Right

94
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:55,743
Is chop them up into little sections starting

95
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:59,839
At the bottom I just see how long they survive through

96
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:09,311
Bisected little pieces

97
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:13,663
Demons and human beings are garbage that all lives within all of us

98
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:20,063
You mentioned her and I want to talk about this the tiny bed Trevor wanted doesn't know Peter today

99
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,087
I was fired by MSI

100
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,903
DC as a contributor because

101
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,439
Mike cernovich

102
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:30,303
Because Mike cernovich and his elk dug up a tweet that he had four

103
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,351
From 2009 wearing he says

104
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:33,375
That he hopes

105
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:36,703
His daughter is raped by Roman Polanski

106
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:40,031
Because he wants his daughter to be raped by someone

107
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:42,079
Play the good sense of mise-en-scene

108
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,615
And that is

109
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,383
Funny

110
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,991
I mean it's funny and it's indicative of outrage at people

111
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:52,319
Excusing the behavior

112
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,343
It's called a joke

113
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,879
A very obvious

114
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:55,903
Literal

115
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,975
And

116
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:05,887
I like the outpouring of support that I've seen on Twitter and took from people like Mark and people who have a voice in it

117
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:06,911
Independent platform

118
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:09,215
But the very idea that MSNBC

119
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:10,751
Would go along with this

120
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:13,055
Is a very very bad sign

121
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,359
Mike cernovich

122
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:18,943
I don't know if it was individually him but I know he was involved

123
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,991
If if Mike cernovich

124
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,271
Does anything

125
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:24,319
Every single media Outlets

126
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:30,719
It should be like okay well let's disregard this entire Life Uniform response should be an eye-rolling

127
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:35,583
And it's f****** guy

128
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,119
Contributor

129
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:40,703
Got an MSNBC guy fired

130
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,031
Someone who would crnkovich would be very scared to

131
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:50,943
Cuz I mean whatever you want liberal or whatever I don't know I don't know what anyone's complaint would be

132
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:51,711
AMC Theatres a f******

133
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,783
He can hold his own

134
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,063
Debates

135
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:58,879
Policy and on all sorts of

136
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:01,183
To the very idea that Mike cernovich would be

137
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,975
You cowardly to discuss this with him

138
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:07,583
Take this sort of a route is kind of exactly against the things they purr

139
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,119
Pretend they're under attack

140
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,423
About all the f****** time

141
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,823
Robert it's an effective tool for them

142
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:21,407
Exact the other thing the reason that I'm I'm bringing it up is because we

143
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,431
To be very very

144
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,711
Scared about what this

145
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:24,479
Portent

146
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:27,807
That is probably had examples of this

147
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,367
Coming down now

148
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,135
Yeah

149
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:33,951
Anything

150
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,231
On the other side

151
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,767
These alt-right

152
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:37,791
And what have you

153
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:42,911
Got a pretty good system together for suppressing people

154
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,191
Yep

155
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:44,959
And

156
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:48,031
You need to be careful about that getting away with murder

157
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:51,359
Who's getting away with murder Charlottesville

158
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:58,271
Alright

159
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:00,063
They're all f******

160
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,855
Guilty

161
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:06,975
Done the other thing I wanted to bring up with a little a little article I ran into the

162
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,023
This morning in my

163
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,815
Wings Over of the news

164
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:14,143
This is an article out of a tablet

165
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:15,935
Dot-com

166
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:16,959
Tablet magazine

167
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,311
Absolutely true

168
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:25,407
Are any of the headline for Alex in case you don't want to hear anything from the article

169
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,687
In Russia

170
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,991
Old antisymmetric blood libel game

171
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,015
Political tracts

172
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:35,903
To Putin claims are Nicholas the second

173
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:38,207
May have been killed in a ritual slaying

174
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:41,279
A century-old Cunard blaming the Jews for Reggie

175
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,327
I've heard of that one right

176
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,375
And the reason that this is very important

177
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,703
We should be very worried about is

178
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,471
Because

179
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,543
Is more indicative of why

180
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,311
Alex

181
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,079
The Russian

182
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:56,127
Barbarian line

183
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,175
I'm very in line

184
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,199
Right

185
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:03,807
And when you look at the things that Alex talks about about how the Russians are waking up

186
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:06,111
And why he's like they're on the right side

187
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,647
Dimensions

188
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:10,975
They talked about how there's poison in the vaccines

189
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:11,999
Is well poison

190
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,047
Type narrative

191
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:17,375
It's it's really really scary

192
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,399
Because

193
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,423
This isn't

194
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,191
Some

195
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:20,959
Crazy

196
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:25,823
Clearance guy or something

197
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,663
He's a very high-ranking Bishop in the Russian Orthodox

198
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:32,479
Church write his name is

199
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,039
Tequan

200
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,111
Anti

201
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,647
So what he did is he

202
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:40,671
He brought this up

203
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:44,511
He brought up this idea that the Jews ritualistically killed Czar Nicholas

204
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:49,375
In a ritualistic ceremony that was in order.

205
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,399
Asurion b*******

206
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:53,471
Which is it a lot of people have

207
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,287
You know spread

208
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,567
Your sense then

209
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,151
It is it is a popular idea among crazy

210
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:05,759
Anything that's really scary

211
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:06,527
This

212
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:07,807
Next line

213
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,623
Following Shoku knobs comments

214
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,415
The powerful investigative can

215
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:15,231
Russia's investigative equivalent of the FBI

216
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,535
Quickly announced that it would take part in such a

217
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,303
Investigation

218
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,607
Of alleged ritual killings

219
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:22,911
So

220
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:25,983
Hey welcome to 27

221
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:31,871
When we when we talk about these things these ideas that Alex Jones

222
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:32,639
Present

223
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:33,407
These narratives

224
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:38,015
The city hasn't what's behind them what we need to realize the reason that were talking about

225
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,807
At least

226
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:42,111
And on top of that

227
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:46,975
A really easy to cut through and

228
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:49,023
But that doesn't mean that there aren't

229
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,327
People in the world who believe the

230
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,351
The same things as him

231
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,119
Starbucks

232
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,143
Board dangerous

233
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,679
Yeah because

234
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,447
Who is the

235
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:57,983
Bright

236
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,263
It'll be awful

237
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,799
This is a 101 types

238
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:01,567
Situation in

239
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:04,383
What's motivating

240
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,663
A lot of them

241
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:08,479
And a lot of trump supporters who don't even realize

242
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,015
Things are what's motivating

243
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,807
They've been duped entirely

244
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:14,879
Welsummer

245
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:19,487
Like

246
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:23,583
Ultimately if you voted for Trump it's because of Ray

247
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:25,631
That's what it is

248
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,215
It's because of race in the complete and utter failure of neoliberal

249
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:29,983
That probably

250
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,031
I made some

251
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:34,847
There are certain other little

252
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:35,615
Pieces that are

253
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:37,919
Letter Factory I don't want to argue on it

254
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:44,063
December 4th

255
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:48,927
Okay but first

256
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,743
Starts with Alex

257
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:52,767
Complaining the whole bunch

258
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:53,535
About

259
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:59,167
That guy who reported that he had a source

260
00:13:59,423 --> 00:13:59,935
I was telling him

261
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:04,287
Oh that's right

262
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,079
Touch with Russia

263
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:08,895
Suspended from ABC for

264
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:09,919
Slightly wrong

265
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:14,271
About this one piece

266
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,295
YouTube information

267
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:17,343
Where is if he worked at

268
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:20,159
Infowars

269
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:22,719
Media Outlet right

270
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,743
Not suspended

271
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,279
Probably would have gotten a f***

272
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:31,679
Let's remember the times that Alex has gotten things wrong today in terms of the

273
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:35,263
He got sued for slander

274
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:41,151
And I have to make a public apology and that immediately started wrong

275
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:41,919
When he walks

276
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:44,223
Very much wrong

277
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:45,759
Complaining about that a bit

278
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,295
But you get sidetracked by

279
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,831
Someone else in pop culture

280
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,623
And it takes him off

281
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:56,767
I wish my dad a live forever

282
00:14:57,023 --> 00:15:02,655
It's just crazy

283
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:08,287
Your Joy Behar celebrating

284
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:14,431
Oh my God

285
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:39,519
Arrest the president

286
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:45,919
Still going on

287
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:57,695
Google really running this song from

288
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:03,071
Commercial first of all fantastic

289
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,375
You know like it sits right

290
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:11,007
Second this is Monday's episode of his show on Friday then people made retraction

291
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:11,775
You know like

292
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:14,591
I don't know if the view did I don't really care

293
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:18,175
First of all

294
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:24,063
Second of all she was saying Brian Ross is reporting that that is true

295
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:29,695
No it would be great I don't know cuz I don't watch the f****** view if they on Monday is episodes

296
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:32,255
We got it wrong we got that information

297
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:33,791
Confirm ABC no don't

298
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,071
Well please don't

299
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,375
Or whatever but if you Google

300
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:40,959
Brian Ross whatever

301
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:48,639
Maybe take out a wrong wrong every single outlet

302
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:52,991
We reported that he reported that but also

303
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:53,759
I don't

304
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,295
I think the people I don't know

305
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:56,831
The View should

306
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,647
I don't care

307
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,671
Hear how happy

308
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:01,695

They were so happy a couple of people to death

310
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:13,215

00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:18,079
But

314
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,407
Conservative voices motorcycle

315
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,175
Pahrump

316
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,223
F****** good

317
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:29,087
I could live in that moment

318
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,391

319
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:39,583

I don't want to hear a groan that last that long

322
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:50,335
Varsho

323
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:59,295
Burrito in the chat my favorite Survivor was was great

324

Libertad

327
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,647
Liberal

328
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:05,183
Chicken Joe

329
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,975
I don't think

330
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:10,303
Not Progressive

331
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:11,583
Doing there now

332
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:12,351
Australia

333
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:16,959
Anyway let's move along this next clip Alex

334
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:18,751
Complaining that no one will retract

335
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:20,031
The story

336
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:22,079
The one that was retracted almost immediately

337
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:38,463
Alex has been trying to troll everybody with the

338
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,911
He's going to piss people off and I were to the

339
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:50,495
More like

340
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:51,519
Yeah the know

341
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:52,799
Your races

342
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:55,103
Regardless of the song

343
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:59,199
Cares what song you're playing

344
00:18:59,455 --> 00:18:59,967
Like that

345
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:06,367
Jocelyn

346
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:13,791
That upset a lot of Democrats

347
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:17,375
Christian

348
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:21,727
The Germanic tradition

349
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:24,543
They want that type of stuff

350
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,615
Obviously

351
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:29,407
Christmas cards at Public School

352
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:31,455
Separation of church and state

353
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,623
Whatever you want

354
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,303
But they're failing

355
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:49,119
People like Joy behar's last week

356
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,655
Huffington Post

357
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:52,447
10:00 weather publication

358
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:53,727
Will not retract

359
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,519
Their reports

360
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:59,103
Celebrating

361
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:02,943
Before the president was elected

362
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,527
Which could be some type of

363
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:14,463
The only reason I left

364
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:20,863
Come out eventually they work

365
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:27,007
I don't know I like the idea that it's all just that they're mad about Christmas than like

366
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:29,567
All this stuff is trying to play that sorta cartoon

367
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:34,687
I've never I've never heard anti-christmas

368
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,247
Fervor

369
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:39,295
From anybody like atheists

370
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,063
I can't figure

371
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:42,879
Like mostly anti-christian

372
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:44,671
Messed up from Chris

373
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:51,071
Like it's two commercial that's the most like aggressive criticism I've ever seen of

374
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:55,167
Never heard one of my

375
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,703
Friendly liberal

376
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:57,727

382
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:05,919
We should celebrate

383
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:06,943
Mithras day

384
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:13,343
Sure actual holiday about Jesus's bulshit

385
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:16,416
The only argument that anybody makes is like

386
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,464
Other people have other holidays

387
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:22,816
Be cool baby don't be a dick about Chris

388
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:26,400
What's what drives me insane

389
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:27,168
Is this

390
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:29,728
This is such one of those moments

391
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,264
Where you see the

392
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,032
Disparity

393
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:36,384
The liberal the progressive band

394
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:37,664
Cannot

395
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,688
Make a meme

396
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:41,248
Bright the conservative bent

397
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,272
Can make

398
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:48,160
Because I'm Cedar made a not even mistake

399
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:50,720
Years ago

400
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:04,288
Yeah he's pretended that he may be involved

401
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:06,848
And it's it's the trick that

402
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,384
We fall into

403
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:09,408
We

404
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:11,200
Holding ourselves to

405
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:12,480
Standard

406
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:13,504
We have to

407
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,528
Deal with real

408
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,624
Yeah that's a problem are holding themselves to the standard of

409
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,696
Realities bulshit we don't even need to worry about

410
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:28,096
That's what I'm saying

411
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:33,472
Function not a bug or whatever it's it's

412
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:36,800

You know credibility and Trust

417
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:45,760
That is an amazing

418
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:47,040
Trick

419
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:47,808

420
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:49,088
Maybe let's do that

421
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:51,648
I don't know how

424
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:56,256
Okay

425
00:22:56,512 --> 00:23:01,120
We're doing this

426
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:02,656
Okay

427
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:05,984
If we all adopt socialism

428
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:08,544
Then everybody will get help

429
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:19,040
What could be better than bringing Knox back2life socialism is known to bring dogs back

430
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:25,184

Still sharing all the celebration clip

449
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:47,616
And then

450
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:52,736
I'd like to take just a quick second to imagine what level of nonsense Alex

Audience

452
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:54,784
The sharing

453
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:56,832
Not true

454
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,904
We don't have time but just imagine

455
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:00,928
Justify

456
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:02,720
I like I like the

457
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:07,584
Who cares about it like you're getting even in your anger

458
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:10,400
Who cares if low-information voters

459
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:16,800
Hear that the president might be cuz he wants the low-information people

460
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:20,640
Is my game information

461
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:21,664
No

462
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:28,576
What information is like a relief it's not like well I guess I'll vote against him

463
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:34,976
Information voters by being like

464
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:37,792
Yeah you know that crime we all know the president committed

465
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:43,936

469
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:04,160
It's not like he was just walking around because I can throw some hot coffee on you

470

Throw coffee

472
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:10,816
I threw coffee on him after he

473
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,728
At least

474
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:19,520

What is it again

479
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:44,608

But here's the really upset about again the president Melania

493
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:55,008
With one of their Christmas messages on Friday

494
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:04,736

So what this is all really about

499
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:17,280
Is that

500
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,560
Trump Melania

501
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,400
Which by the way he definitely make sure that

502
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:24,192
It's not Melania Trump

503
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:25,472
Donald Trump

504
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:31,872
And then he's already said that he has information

505
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:35,712
Understand

506
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:38,272

507
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:42,880
That's what that's what everyone cheering

508
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:44,928
For the eventual impeach

509
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,816
Felony conviction and all the hung by the neck until dead drum

00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:57,984
Merry Christmas carols in the globalist they're scared of the power that say Merry Christmas

511
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,312
He's bringing this

512
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:02,336
Tradition back

513
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:06,432
And that

514
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:08,736
When I was a young man

515
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:12,576
That's no

516
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:18,976
I read some books

517
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:21,792
I didn't think it could be more pathetic

518
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:22,816
Then Fox News

519
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:25,376
Just handling of the idea

520
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:27,936
Oh yeah I really thought that like

521
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:28,960
That was

522
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:30,752
Some shameful desperate

523
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:37,152
Grab Lakeside

524
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:39,200
The Christian complained that I'd always heard about

525
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:42,272
Christmas was that you know it's over-commercialized

526
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:47,392
Getting rid of the reason for the season

527
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:50,720
That obviously scamming your audience's just commercial eBay

528
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:54,048
Seems like it'll all of the war on Christmas ideas

529
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:55,584
It's not it's not like it's

530
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:56,608
It's Campbell

531
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:58,400
It's literally the worst

532
00:29:58,656 --> 00:29:59,168
Diversion

533
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:02,496
Getting outside of the reason for the season

534
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:04,800
Until I mean the Alex is probably

535
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:11,200
Behaving and what I would describe as the least Christian way to me is that that segment producer

536
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:12,992
Who came up with that idea

537
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:14,784
Is not a Billy

538
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:17,856
Fox News

539
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:20,672
Resonated so much like you should have gotten

540
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:22,464
Least 150

541
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:23,744
That's right

542
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:30,144
Let me think about how that we think of that episode on The Wire D'Angelo chicken nugget

543
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,960
That sort of thing

544
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,264
Too bad anyway

545
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:38,592
This is about where we leave the Joy Behar

546
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:46,016
It was just a couple

547
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:50,368
No he makes hang out of it there's no doubt about that

548
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,392
And then

549
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:54,976
Towards the end of the first out there's a bunch of rambling blah blah blah blah blah

550
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:58,304
Yeah it does something

551
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,584
That I got

552
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:01,120
Pretty excited about

553
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:03,936
I should also tell you I'm pretty sure he's drunk

554
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:04,960
Appreciate

555
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:11,360
Alright because at one point after the news came down getting ready

556
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:12,640
Will drunk that's going to last him

557
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:18,016
A little bit later in the episode I did hear that

558
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:22,368
Together like a highball or something like that happened to again

559
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:23,904
Happen exactly when

560
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:26,208
They have the other image up on screen

561
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,048
Do you like let's go to the caller image video on him

562
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,328
And it sounds like

563
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,376
You slurping slurping a drink

564
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:35,680
But it's not big

565
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:40,544
People's behavior gets pretty weird his behavior is weird

566
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,640
Before we get to that let's say

567
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:47,968
I had high hopes

568
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:48,992
1 hours

569
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:49,760
Yes

570
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:51,552

If you were going to get you Russian agent

580
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:40,448
First of all there's no one there now

581
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:43,264
There's no one's answering the hotline

582
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:48,384
It's 7:30 they don't do the Nightly News live

583
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,944
I'm sure they don't have a name

584
00:32:58,112 --> 00:33:00,160
At least it's in there

585
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:04,512
Owen Shroyer ghost

586
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:07,328
Millie Weaver goes

588
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:15,008
Not talk to us they will not discuss anything with us

589
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:18,080
Well here's your chance

590
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:19,360
To prove me wrong

591
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:26,016
So first of all the premise there at the end everywhere I go no one will talk to me I wonder why that is I haven't

592
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:29,344
Alternative explanation other than they have no intellectual argument

593
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,880
I would posit that

594
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:33,952
Okay should I be Alex or you

595
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:34,720
Okay

596
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:40,352
Go fuc yourself

597
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:47,264
That's probably a man on the street

598
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:52,128
Rich people in Seattle

599
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:55,712
Ice cream cupcake at that lady when he's drunk on the streets

600
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,272
Time to get in

601
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:05,440
With your first episode

602
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:07,744
Fred Meyer

603
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:15,680
I want such a huge fan it's not that it's it's a real

604
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:20,032
Real kind of everyday

605
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:22,336
I still don't really believe

606
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,128
Corporeal

607
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:31,552
He's like a robot or something

608
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:32,576
B someone lives

609
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:33,344
Isn't this much of a

610
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:34,368
People headspace

611
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,416
Is it terrifying

612
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:39,232
I was walking around earlier today

613
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:40,768
Absorbed all the news

614
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:41,792
And what have you

615
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,680
Beginning of the show other stuff like with this

616
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,240
Travel ban

617
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:52,032
Is possibly okay

618
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:58,688
Neil Gorsuch

619
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:00,992
I want

620
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,832
We need more

621
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:05,600
Like what

622
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:06,624
Spells at 4

623
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,416
For the future

624
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:09,952
I almost broke down

625
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:12,000
Tears just walking down the street

626
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:13,792
Fairly uncommon for me

627
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:15,584
Since cock song came on my

628
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,376
My random playlist in that

629
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:23,776
Hit a nerve strike that from the record

630
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:24,544
I was like

631
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,384
You got me emotionally because I was very I was very

632
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,688
Struck by the same thing

633
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:35,040
Do I have to

634
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:36,576
Tamp down my emotions like

635
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:38,112
The good Irishman that I was

636
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:39,904
Look look the point

637
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,464
The point I was trying to get at is

638
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:44,768
Like

639
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:46,816
I know what effect

640
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:48,608
This is having on me

641
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:52,960
Like dwelling in the world of Alex Jones and listening to your regularly

642
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:55,776
There are so many people listen

643
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:56,800
Regularly

644
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:59,616
And I can't imagine how it's not affected

645
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:00,384
Them

646
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:03,968
I was trying to get myself into

647
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:04,736
Like

648
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:07,296
I don't know if I'm articulating as well but

649
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:09,088
Was like what

650
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:10,368
Must it be like

651
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,648
I think this is right

652
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,696
Or think this is real

653
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:16,768
Think that anything that he's saying is true and not just trying to

654
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:18,304
Do you s***

655
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:21,632
Absorbing that hatred absorbing that

656
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:23,936
Just repackaged

657
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:26,240
Dometic canards right like what

658
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:29,056
What kind of pool does that take on you

659
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:32,128
If it's taking this kind of a toll on me

660
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,152
And I'm

661
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:37,760
Keenly aware of what I'm listening to deconstructing it in fighting back against

662
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:39,040
It's horrifying

663
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:40,576
I think

664
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:42,368
You are going about it the exact

665
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:43,648
Opposite

666
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:47,232
Did I say a dollar man

667
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:53,632
Erection of a convex bone

668
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:54,656
Text opposite direction

669
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:57,728
Because if you are

670
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:58,752
Stupid and angry

671
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:00,800
What you have to be to list

672
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:01,568
Listen to him in this

673
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:05,152
I think that I can't I think that you're wrong

674
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:14,624
Disagree I just put for the exact opposite idea what you just said and I hold the reason I think you're wrong

675
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,392
Become stupid

676
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:16,928
You're stupid

677
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:21,024
To begin with but I think that people get like I know that's for me when I

678
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:23,328
Listen to Alex Jones a little bit or

679
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:26,144
Ourfriendbarney DeRosa listen to Alex

680
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:29,472
Some listeners who I've talked to who used to listen to him

681
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:30,496
Who are idiots

682
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:31,776
One of the reasons

683
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:32,544
Bet you do

684
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,592
Cuz there's a lot of the conspiracy stuff is

685
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:39,200
There's some stuff that's pretty interesting in the idea of rapid and knowledge

686
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:40,480
In the idea of like

687
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:42,272
An alternative explanation

688
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:43,552
So many things that

689
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:48,928
Do you mind explainable the insinuation of someone who knows true

690
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,464
Is very alert

691
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,232
When you start to itch

692
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:52,512
Explore the little bit

693
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:55,328
And I think by degrees you could end up

694
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:56,608
Becoming dumb

695
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:59,168
Angrier because

696
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:01,472
Does narrative hook you and you don't realize

697
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:03,520
Okay let me let me go back

698
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:04,288
I use

699
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:05,312
Stupid in the wrong

700
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:07,616
I meant is naive

701
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:08,384
The classical set

702
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:10,432
Because there is no

703
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:13,248
Because like with our friends who have listened before

704
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:16,064
View is not something that you can gain

705
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:19,904
Know that you only move away from

706
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:21,952
So anybody who is listen

707
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:23,744
To Alex Jones in believing in that

708
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:25,280
Is naive

709
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,304
And they have not

710
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,328
Growing away from me

711
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,376
Just like our I don't begrudge

712
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:32,192
It's not that you're stupid

713
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:33,216
You listen to Alex

714
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,312
You're stupid if you continue to believe

715
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:42,432
Piece of his marketing operation

716
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:45,248
Work in tandem in their inexplicable

717
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:46,784
But I

718
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,088
Products for knowledge fight line

719
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,112
Okay

720
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:55,744
It's like it's like the cow goes moo that's the name of it

721
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,328
Shred core band

722
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:02,400
But like those things

723
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:06,496
One of the features of how it has to work

724
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:07,776
Is you have to

725
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:09,056
Instill in your audience

726
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:10,848
A sense of

727
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,920
Acquired and reinforcement evatac

728
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:16,480
Like you need that to sustain

729
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:18,528
Cuz if you lose that naivete

730
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:23,904
You start to read article to say like oh

731
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:25,696
Oh this is stupid

732
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:28,512
This is where you start to ask questions of like

733
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,632
My old Christian Ska band was called the detonators

734
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,168
Anyway

735
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,776
I had to undercut my own point of time.

736
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:43,104
Let's move on to the next clip where Alex again

737
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:45,408
I was young

738
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:46,176
Anyway

739
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:50,272
That did not

740
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:54,624
So in the next life by we get to hear more about how Alex

741
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,184
Real quick

742
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,464
Just my point being

743
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,232
In regards to that

744
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:01,280
Is something that you

745
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:03,840
And you can force

746
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:05,632
Yes

747
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:06,656
Something that can

748
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:09,472
You can't go towards

749
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:11,008
You can only go away

750
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,848
Do you know what I mean I believe so yes

751
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:16,128
Like I use stupid as a

752
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:17,664
The catch-all in it it is Kai

753
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,688
Kind of a

754
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:22,016
Only don't mean in that

755
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:23,040
It is dumb

756
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:28,416
It's at their naive and it is dumb

757
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:32,768
Ikea

758
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:35,328
What we can sum it up with his only the naive

759
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:36,096
Can stay

760
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:38,912
Exactly the rest will be

761
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:39,936
Exactly

762
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:40,704
But

763
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,520
It was that call we get more about to Alex is going to

764
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:44,288
To take calls

765
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:46,848
I've given the phone number out

766
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:51,456
For people that disagree under Russian control

767
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:54,784
That I'm getting orders from a Raichu

768
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,624
Please

769
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,816
I mean you lyrics

770
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:10,400
You're welcome to call in and ask if

771
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:13,216
I'm a violin player from

772
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,056
Who I am

773
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:23,712
Multinational Force

774
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:25,760
I want to challenge you

775
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:28,832
Are you proud of

776
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,184
Nothing

777
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:36,768
From the truth

778
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:39,840
All they're doing is putting together an obstruction

779
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:40,608
Justice case

780
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:41,888
The Democrat

781
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,192
Buehler's

782
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:50,080
Like

783
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:56,735
I would like to do my impression of Alex Jones

784
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:58,527
Nylon 100 years

785
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:02,879
So 1930

786
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:04,415
Al Capone

787
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:06,719
Look you forgot to fill out a tax form

788
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:13,119
That's everybody

789
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:18,239
Instructions to fill out a form

790
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:21,567
A ham sandwich these days

791
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:25,151
Now you can say that Jefferson Davis is an agent of the

792
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:30,527
But that's just like calling me a my next invasion of China

793
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:36,415
Violin player from let's make

794
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:38,463
Ridiculous strawman

795
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:40,767
Is that some Star Wars

796
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:54,591
Yeah that's what what's that nice noodles

797
00:42:54,847 --> 00:43:00,991
I can't remember it's the Cantina Band

798
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:06,111
So in this

799
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:07,647
Name was the

800
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:09,439
Like the

801
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:12,511
Now there's no sense

802
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:19,423
They were playing the band

803
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:20,191
I'm pretty sure

804
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:21,471
It was like

805
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:22,239
Nice noodle

806
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:28,895
That I might speak

807
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:38,111
Within time I'm seeing from the chatroom figuring Dan and the modal node

808
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:38,879
Is that correct

809
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:46,303
I don't care anymore I don't give a fuk about Star Wars I'm here I'm here from the mooch

810
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:48,863
Jeezy

811
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:50,399
Screw you

812
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:52,959
So

813
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:54,239
Alex's built-up

814
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:55,775
The fact that he's going to take calls

815
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:59,103
Noodles Palace

816
00:43:59,359 --> 00:43:59,871
So I wasn't

817
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:00,895
Totally off

818
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:07,551
I have these nerd memories from when I was younger in

819
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:11,135
Plot of Star Wars a long time ago I was in the trenches

820
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:17,023
Is going

821
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:22,143
See people can prove

822
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:24,191
Videos related to Trump and I

823
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:27,007
I want to be clear I had way too much work to do today

824
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:30,335
And I was not listening lies I had to double back

825
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:37,247
Intelligence

826
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:39,551
You didn't alert the FBI afterwards

827
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:43,135
Right at is enough to be very seriously concerned about your

828
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:45,439
Now let's talk about blood libel

829
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:49,279
Now let's talk about how much your position on Putin is change

830
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:50,559
Over the years

831
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:52,351
Now let's talk about these

832
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:56,447
Weird conversations you had with Rodger Stone and Steve pieczenik

833
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:57,215
Indeed

834
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:58,495
December of 2015

835
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:04,383
It was a weird turn the last time we went on a double date near like

836
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:06,431
Now let's talk about bloodline

837
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:10,527
It's not far off

838
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:13,599
Is it strange that I was hanging out with some comedian friend

839
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:18,207
Send the business Lisa Traeger was in town over the weekend

840
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:20,767
I went to go see her perform with Our Friend Martin

841
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:28,703
Explain exactly inozen

842
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:31,007
Other

843
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:40,991
Whenever we get together we just want to talk about

844
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:47,391
Various deep cuts from Britney Spears first album and what about you

845
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:51,999
End up coming into my social life

846
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:56,863
Important there's a new Holocaust, alright you understand

847
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:59,423
What am I supposed to say I do the same thing

848
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:03,263
I feel bad for whatever influence

849
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:04,543
You may have on our collars

850
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:06,591
Bark collars

851
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:11,967
I got caller in the head because the rest of the show is going to deal with a lot of calls

852
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:17,855
Alex Box 435

853
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:19,391
About

854
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:21,183
With commercials cutout 35

855
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:24,511
Okay about weather

856
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:27,839
Your vamping

857
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:29,631
You don't want to take these calls

858
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:33,471
You you're worried that someone will say something smart

859
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:35,263
And so he have to be like

860
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:41,663
It wasn't in the articles 501c is where you're wrong

861
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:46,783
Common law

862
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:52,415
You're not an admiral

863
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:01,631
Struggled

864
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:04,447
They're just

865
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:05,983
Some trash

866
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:17,503
Alright

867
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:21,343
Kevin Terrence Aaron Chad John

868
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:24,927
Does any of these people disagree

869
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:27,999
Maybe Kevin does Kevin

870
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:35,935
Not a huge fan of his first caller he goes to is going to be critical

871
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:39,775
I think it was first color

872
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:41,567
Plug one of his products

873
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:44,639
Kevin and Chad

874
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:49,503
Yeah Alex I've listened to you longer than the NSA has

875
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:51,807
Give you a chance

876
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:54,879
Do you think he's critical or do you think he's a fan

877
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:58,207
How many go with he's a fat

878
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:02,815
And watch your show and I have to say you're probably

879
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:03,839
Leeward

880
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:07,423
Double speaking liar there is

881
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:09,727
So it's got me lyrics

882
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:11,775
Alright

883
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:15,103
Let's see what he says

884
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:16,895
And I can prove it

885
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:19,967
The first thing is when it comes to Russia

886
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:23,551
There's one thing that you could do to prove it but you won't

887
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:24,831
Release

888
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:25,855
Your Finance

889
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:27,903
So first of all

890
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:29,695
That's a bad that's a bad attack

891
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:33,023
Releases finances for other

892
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:35,327
Probably not funneling him

893
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:40,959
All these other things and I think the world would be

894
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:42,751
Much better off for

895
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:43,519
Knowing

896
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:45,823
Feels

897
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:47,359
But there's other reasons

898
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:51,967
To his listeners and To The World At Large

899
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:53,759
Where the money's coming from

900
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:54,783
Coming probably

901
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:55,551
More like Mercer

902
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:58,623
Or I one of these other billionaire assholes or the coke

903
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:05,023
The top five people on my

904
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:07,327
Yeah it's at least a little

905
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:11,423
At least the dark and I appreciate it

906
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:14,239
Improved your audience

907
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:16,799
Where are your money actually comes

908
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:23,199
Okay the second as far as doublespeak goes

909
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:24,479
I mean

910
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:27,295
You already said on Joe Rogan's podcast

911
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:30,111
That you were pressured by your advertisers

912
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:32,159
July about Y2K

913
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:34,975
You said that Russia

914
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:38,047
Launch intercontinental ballistic missiles

915
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:39,839
Against the United States

916
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:43,167
Another reason why you're probably tied to Russia

917
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:44,447
If she don't call

918
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:45,983
Vladimir Putin

919
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:48,031
A literal demon

920
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:50,591
Just like you call Hillary now

921
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:51,359
You called

922
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:55,199
Back then a literal demon

923
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:58,015
21st

924
00:49:58,271 --> 00:50:04,415
First of all taken f****** notes Alex you have huge stacks of paper in front of you you should

925
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:07,231
One thing just to be fair

926
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:10,559
Alex

927
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:12,863
Against this caller

928
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:16,703
Literally demon

929
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:18,751
He's at he's resembling a demon

930
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:25,407
He says but he is going crazy and he looks like a beaver

931
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:32,063
Who gives a f*** about that we don't need to be honest we don't need to recognize the truth

932
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:33,599
You know what he said

933
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:36,159
He didn't just say it was a literal demon

934
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:39,231
He said Putin gave him a handjob in high school

935
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:45,631
No I go back to the early I go back to the Chris gethard early motto lose well that's what I

936
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:50,751
Play insist on doing we will stay true to reality and inevitably

937
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:55,871
Get murdered by hordes of Ding Dongs

938
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:00,223
I don't like that

939
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:03,551
So Alex is needed to take a break

940
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:09,951
Because he's got a you got to write this down or that I can't remember all that all those complaints

941
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:13,279
In fairness to this color again

942
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:14,303
Since you he did make

943
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:17,119
The finances

944
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:17,887
Yep

945
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:23,519
I wouldn't lying about altogether

946
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:25,311
2K is absolutely true

947
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:27,615
I need does say that on Roku

948
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:33,759
And it's clear that because

949
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:40,159
Boot & Saddle

950
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:41,695
In order to sell

951
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:44,511
You got it that is why he did that

952
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:47,071
I think what I can't wait we got to do that 911

953
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:48,095
Episode one of these days

954
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:53,215
Cuz I didn't want to do it but then I started to think more about that Anderson and how many 9/11 that were

955
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:57,311
We're currently living through my remember from watch

956
00:51:57,567 --> 00:52:00,127
The 9/11 episode there's a lot of gold sale

957
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:02,687
Forasmuch as Alex screams

958
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:03,711
I called the

959
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:07,039
And all that stuff gloating about

960
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:09,087
A lot of it

961
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:10,879
A lot of it

962
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:11,903
That might be another connection

963
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:15,999
Between him and their immediate reaction to 9/11

964
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:19,583
So I think I think that he is

965
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:22,655
He's complained about his finances could have been better presented but

966
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:23,423
Good call

967
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:25,983
Goodwin

968
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:31,359
The Putin is a demon good but also slightly inaccurate

969
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:34,431
Bright

970
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:35,967
Let's see how Alex was

971
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:44,159
I told the story about not knowing how real-life UK would be

972
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:54,655
Sponsors that listeners

973
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:55,935
So

974
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:56,703
That mean

975
00:52:57,983 --> 00:52:58,495
You lied

976
00:52:58,751 --> 00:52:59,263
Convince

977
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:01,567
Sponsors convinced

978
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:04,383
Listeners convince

979
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:05,407
You're convinced

980
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:07,455
If listener is convinced you

981
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:10,271
You need to reassess how you get information

982
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:12,831
Secondarily if sponsors

983
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:14,367
Convinced you

984
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:15,391
Venue

985
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:18,719
Are lying in order to appease a sponsor

986
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:22,815
I don't understand his admitted that his critique is actually correct

987
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:23,583
Alright

988
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:33,055
Ballistic missiles

989
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:54,047
I'm signing for the listeners

990
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:56,863
Almost

991
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:58,399
Sriracha

992
00:53:58,655 --> 00:54:01,215
How do UK workers lost up Canada orders lot of stuff

993
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:02,751
My stores lot stuff

994
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:17,087
Warehouse

995
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:18,623
A plug

996
00:54:18,879 --> 00:54:22,207
We're going to be able to get your product

997
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:27,583
He's pretty smooth that is smooth as s***

998
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:28,863
Is it garbage can go f*** him

999
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:29,887
Alpha god dammit

1000
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:30,655
What is that wasn't great

1001
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:41,663
That's not an answer Russia Gave Me 0

1002
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:48,063
I don't think it's a reasonable thing to do you know what happened kislyak gave him $50

1003
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:54,463
Absurdly low amount

1004
00:54:57,791 --> 00:54:59,839
Certainly did by boosting your

1005
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:01,887
It counts and all of that

1006
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:03,679
You sold more advertisements

1007
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:10,335
People so technically they did give me an indirect way another thing that's really interesting and

1008
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:11,359
I'll put together some click

1009
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:12,127
Clips

1010
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:13,663
About this in the future but

1011
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:16,223
The number of times people have called in and asked

1012
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:17,247
About the Koch brothers

1013
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:20,063
You did not answer

1014
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:22,367
He just says

1015
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:26,207
You just answer answers

1016
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:27,999
So

1017
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:31,071
They're not really all that political they only give me a million

1018
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:37,215
I need more

1019
00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:44,383
I mean

1020
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:47,967
Literally

1021
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:49,503
Literally

1022
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:53,343
Say something on the biggest podcast in the world

1023
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:58,207
Smoking pot

1024
00:55:58,463 --> 00:56:01,791
We caught on a podcast that 45 million viewers

1025
00:56:04,607 --> 00:56:09,471
You know I get the Superbowl if I was in the Super Bowl

1026
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:11,263
Football

1027
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:23,295
Where is the evidence that I'm involved with Russia

1028
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:26,367
Well there is you admitting that you spoke to Russian in

1029
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:32,767
His his slimy moving to a sales pitch

1030
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:35,327
Great his dissembling on like

1031
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:44,287
Also it's more fun to bring up the idea that

1032
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:47,615
You also said there were concentration

1033
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:48,639
Camp set up a notch

1034
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:54,015
What are those for

1035
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:56,831
Do you literally

1036
00:56:59,391 --> 00:57:01,439
Believe that I have some connection to Russia

1037
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:08,095
So Alex I'm going to take you up on your deal I will release by finances and you will have to do the same

1038
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:14,495
You just said it to your whole body at least mine hey hey what's up bro you have nothing

1039
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:20,639
There you go I said Russia fired a missile

1040
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:31,903
Capitol Fax

1041
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:36,255
So he has that

1042
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:40,351
Yeah he thinks he want that one

1043
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:44,447
C1 that exchange break music plays

1044
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:48,287
Talked over him when he's trying to make another point but

1045
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:50,847
Be better than me that's fine you know

1046
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:52,639
Deflection

1047
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:54,175
So not answering no questions

1048
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:56,479
Critiques that the guy brought up

1049
00:57:58,015 --> 00:57:58,527
Find

1050
00:57:59,039 --> 00:57:59,807
She gets back from

1051
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:00,831
Commercial

1052
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:02,367
Goodbye Chris commercial break

1053
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:04,415
Gets a little.

1054
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:07,999
Not have been

1055
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:09,023
The best for

1056
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:11,327
He doesn't like

1057
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:12,863
Not necessarily

1058
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:14,911
We just took a call

1059
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:20,031
From somebody that was going to give me evidence of Mike Russian connection

1060
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:23,871
It's ridiculous

1061
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:26,431
The Cold War is Over

1062
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:30,271
Theologically Russia is more like the US used to be

1063
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:33,343
We Face the same level as foes

1064
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:36,415
Multi-country

1065
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:38,463
That's the only connection

1066
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:48,703
All the hype about Vladimir Putin because I've investigated myself

1067
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:50,495
Media

1068
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:55,103
Lying about me

1069
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:00,991
This is my country

1070
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:03,295
The Communist Chinese

1071
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:08,159
They're starting to control Hollywood

1072
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:19,679
Before I go back to your calls just briefly here

1073
00:59:22,751 --> 00:59:23,263
That

1074
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:28,895
Understand what's going on

1075
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:40,671
Child support broadcast.com it's a big deal

1076
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:42,207
It's a big deal

1077
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:47,839
Hey you know how much he hates those globalist multinational corporations who

1078
00:59:48,095 --> 00:59:50,399
Trump did just give 2 trillion dollars

1079
00:59:50,911 --> 00:59:52,447
Yes that is true

1080
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:54,751
Because

1081
00:59:59,103 --> 00:59:59,615
That's why

1082
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:04,479
Critical nonsense

1083
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:05,759
A game that doesn't work

1084
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:10,879
Did I want to bring out of there is that Alex

1085
01:00:15,743 --> 01:00:20,863
He does identify with and connect with with the Russians is what he believes to be fighting again

1086
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:22,911
Globalism and the globalist

1087
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:26,751
Right as we know from a years-long investigation the globalist

1088
01:00:27,007 --> 01:00:27,775
Aren't real

1089
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:28,799
No globalist

1090
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:30,079
Are Alex Jones at

1091
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:30,847
Cover

1092
01:00:31,103 --> 01:00:32,895
For archaic anti-semitic Canard

1093
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:35,199
Inform his worldview

1094
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:36,991
And that's why it's really important

1095
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:38,271
Just got the beginning of

1096
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:41,599
The show this Russian Bishop

1097
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:44,927
Is bringing back up blood libel

1098
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:48,511
It's because of that is this when Alex says

1099
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:50,815
You just said literally there

1100
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:52,351
That's the connection we had

1101
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:54,143
It's not that

1102
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:56,703
Important

1103
01:00:56,959 --> 01:00:59,263
To make clear

1104
01:00:59,775 --> 01:01:00,287
Is that

1105
01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:03,359
It is not necessarily anti-semite

1106
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:05,663
The way that

1107
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:07,455
It out it's not

1108
01:01:08,223 --> 01:01:10,015
It's not specifically targeted

1109
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:12,575
What he's done is repurpose

1110
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:13,343
Anti-seize

1111
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:14,367
Bulshit from

1112
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:15,903
Hundred years ago

1113
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:17,183
And applied it to

1114
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:23,583
Everyone who's not him he's with us agrees with him is a blood libel

1115
01:01:24,095 --> 01:01:25,375
Against

1116
01:01:25,631 --> 01:01:26,143
You know

1117
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:27,935
Social oppression

1118
01:01:29,215 --> 01:01:33,055
Amore fair and equal Society

1119
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:33,823
Is

1120
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:35,103
Guilty of bloodline

1121
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:39,199
Unless we forget the protocols of the Elders of Zion written by

1122
01:01:44,063 --> 01:01:45,343
All super-connected

1123
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:47,647
These philosophical

1124
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:49,951
Ideas it's that act like I keep

1125
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:51,487
Describing it as a brain virus

1126
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:52,255
Because it is

1127
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:53,535
It gets in

1128
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:54,815
Contact

1129
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:56,863
It gives a false

1130
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:57,631
Contacts

1131
01:01:57,887 --> 01:01:59,167
Everything that you look

1132
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:06,079
Like what you were saying there to the idea that he's just he just replies it for political gain is one

1133
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:07,871
Piece of it but the brain viruses

1134
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:09,663
It's not just working but not

1135
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:11,711
It also is hatred

1136
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:12,991
It absolutely is

1137
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:14,271
No

1138
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:17,855
It's probably not hatred to like I hate all Jews

1139
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:19,647
He doesn't

1140
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:23,743
You know it was interesting as a like this is a great

1141
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:25,023
Paper

1142
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:25,791
15 years

1143
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:29,119
You yet

1144
01:02:29,631 --> 01:02:30,143
But

1145
01:02:30,911 --> 01:02:32,703
If you consider that anti-semitism

1146
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:34,239
And the way that it has

1147
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:37,055
Spread throughout Europe in all of those

1148
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:40,383
That is really the fear of

1149
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:41,407
Foreign

1150
01:02:41,919 --> 01:02:42,687
People stealing

1151
01:02:43,711 --> 01:02:44,223
Essentially

1152
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:48,319
It's like blood libel ideas and all that s*** was

1153
01:02:48,575 --> 01:02:54,463
Lake generally rooted in you sir Adrian idea that Christians can't give out money

1154
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:57,023
What is this

1155
01:02:57,279 --> 01:02:58,559
What all of this

1156
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:03,935
The same thing

1157
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:05,471
If you just take out

1158
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:06,239
Jew-fro

1159
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:08,543
Right

1160
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:10,079
Observation

1161
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:12,639
Blood libel and bigotry

1162
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:14,687
Through the use of the internet in the way that

1163
01:03:14,943 --> 01:03:15,455
Connected

1164
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:18,527
One thing the people did not expect from the internet

1165
01:03:18,783 --> 01:03:21,599
Because everybody was like

1166
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:22,879
They didn't expect

1167
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:25,183
Bigotry to follow along

1168
01:03:25,695 --> 01:03:29,535
And it's the same bigotry of a small Russian village 100

1169
01:03:30,047 --> 01:03:30,559
2 years ago

1170
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:33,119
You know ten Jews come in

1171
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:34,655
Make money

1172
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:38,751
It's the same fear on a global scale because now we're all connected

1173
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:40,799
Do each other the racism is just bigger

1174
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:47,199
We're all juice but I'm saying it always looks like

1175
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:48,223
It's going away and then

1176
01:03:49,247 --> 01:03:50,527
Butter

1177
01:03:50,783 --> 01:03:53,087
And the only way to stop a virus

1178
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:54,623
Of course to develop

1179
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:56,671
Or kill all of the

1180
01:03:56,927 --> 01:03:57,439
Conservatives

1181
01:03:58,463 --> 01:03:58,975
Politically

1182
01:03:59,231 --> 01:04:01,535
I don't think Alex is going to be thrilled at the idea of a vaccine

1183
01:04:02,303 --> 01:04:03,327
Politico

1184
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:06,143
He's not into the vaccine idea

1185
01:04:06,655 --> 01:04:07,167
What's all this

1186
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:09,215
Okay

1187
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:10,751
Look at a clean vaccine

1188
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:13,055
I want to go to the next call

1189
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:15,871
I want to go to the next call but I

1190
01:04:16,383 --> 01:04:17,151
Not even a beetle

1191
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:21,503
I can't go to the next call

1192
01:04:21,759 --> 01:04:27,903
Because there is not next call for a bit cuz Alex

1193
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:32,767
A bunch of calls and if you disagree with me now

1194
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:36,863
He just Rambles about how I

1195
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:38,143
Not real

1196
01:04:38,399 --> 01:04:39,935
Not accurate MN

1197
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:41,215
Which

1198
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:43,263
Vicki's revealing a little bit about being a bad

1199
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:45,311
At the beginning

1200
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:52,735
One of my daughters temperature this morning

1201
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:57,855
Because you had never come out and the tooth is coming in

1202
01:04:58,623 --> 01:04:59,647
Chukar Road

1203
01:05:00,671 --> 01:05:04,255
I never met the dentist they've been there for five times last few years

1204
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:06,047
I would argue that that's a sign

1205
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:07,071
You're being a little

1206
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:10,911
If they've been going to the same dentist for a few years

1207
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:12,959
He said 45 times

1208
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:17,823
In the past few years going to

1209
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:21,663
In the past few years

1210
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:23,967
Daddy's Gone

1211
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:26,783
I don't think he's ever met

1212
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:30,111
That I went to

1213
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:34,207
Alright

1214
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:35,743
I'll give this one

1215
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:40,095
My dentist

1216
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:43,423
Let Me Gucci

1217
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:44,191
I have met

1218
01:05:44,447 --> 01:05:46,495
Especially when I was under like 30

1219
01:05:47,007 --> 01:05:48,543
My parents didn't let me date a dent

1220
01:05:49,055 --> 01:05:49,823
Until I ran away date

1221
01:05:51,103 --> 01:05:52,383
That's very Christian of them

1222
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:54,175
But I never met them

1223
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:56,479
Dennis come out to Miami Sylvester

1224
01:05:58,271 --> 01:05:59,295
Anesthesiologist

1225
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:05,439
Regulations and laws on laughing gas they have an anesthesiologist there to do

1226
01:06:05,951 --> 01:06:06,975
Washington

1227
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:10,303
And it was just

1228
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:13,375
Humbling

1229
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:16,959
It professionals all over our list

1230
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:18,751
Or they're being

1231
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:28,479
Other talk show hosts

1232
01:06:30,271 --> 01:06:31,039
We're winning

1233
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:33,855
There's nothing

1234
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:36,927
We run into people that are big fans of the show

1235
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:53,055
So there is a lot of Hope

1236
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:55,871
As long as the economy is growing

1237
01:06:56,127 --> 01:06:57,151
Optimism

1238
01:06:57,663 --> 01:06:59,967
Investigation

1239
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:02,271
We know it's not going anywhere

1240
01:07:08,415 --> 01:07:10,975
I think it more more more

Go out and beat people up

1244
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:21,215
Just because you put it we disagree with them

1245
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:26,079
That's a big question

Lisa Vespa

1251
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:39,903
Piece of this

1252
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:41,183
Is that if I found out my

1253
01:07:41,439 --> 01:07:41,951
My dentist listen

1256
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:46,559
But he doesn't run

1257

Infowars

1258
01:07:48,351 --> 01:07:50,655
Alex's dad isn't even a name for warrior

1259

No money

1260
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:54,239
Nada

1261
01:07:57,311 --> 01:07:58,335
You didn't work

He did that he did all of the CIA

What time I die. Guy was in the service when he came into work on these weird stuff

1267

Gas

1268
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:13,439
The story I'm sure

1269
01:08:13,951 --> 01:08:14,719
Be that as it may

1270
01:08:14,975 --> 01:08:15,487
Do they

1271
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:16,767
Really they have to

1272
01:08:17,023 --> 01:08:18,047
Really have started

1273
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:19,071
To buy their own bowls

1274
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:20,607

All of the

2A

1279
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:28,543
Either that or it's another story

1280
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:31,871
That's probably what it is

1281
01:08:32,127 --> 01:08:32,639
The only reason

1282
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:33,663
Like what

Spell attached

1284
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:36,479
They kind of get it

1285
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:39,295
Like they got what they want

1286
01:08:39,807 --> 01:08:41,343
The Richard going to abandon

1287
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:46,207
Like that's going to happen I don't I think there's a lot more work left to do beyond the text

1288
01:08:46,463 --> 01:08:50,559
The episode

1289
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:56,191
Will be the unstable the instability actually works in service

1290
01:08:59,263 --> 01:09:05,407

Aaron's in Washington

1298
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:28,191
Go ahead

1299
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:31,519
How you doing

1300
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:38,943
Hey me and my girlfriend Sabrina been listeners for a long time I've been less than a lot longer now this is just

1301
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:44,319
But I like to say to you I acted like using human-to-human you know about communication contact

1302
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:45,599
Now

1303
01:09:45,855 --> 01:09:47,647
Do you think that this is a critical call

1304
01:09:48,671 --> 01:09:49,183
Nautica

1305
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:53,535
You taught me

1306
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:55,839
That's what I got to say

1307
01:09:57,119 --> 01:10:00,447
You are a lot more passionate by where you're speaking about

1308
01:10:00,703 --> 01:10:04,287
When you were trying to save the world besides the political mess

1309
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:11,199
Defending Trump now are you seeing something in your tarot cards that says you need to put all your chips

1310
01:10:11,455 --> 01:10:12,479
Down on Trump

1311
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:15,551
Or work down the Dead

1312
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:17,343
4

1313
01:10:17,855 --> 01:10:21,439
And the fact that keeping Trump right now

1314
01:10:22,207 --> 01:10:27,071
Is leaving this race war and a possible Civil War would you give up Trump

1315
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:30,399
Keep it civil war from happening

1316
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:33,215
Great question

1317
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:39,615
So we'll see how we'll see how Alex answers

1318
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:41,663
Rambly

1319
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:44,223
Not well so the question at its core

1320
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:46,527
Is I mean the subtext of it is

1321
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:49,343
I mean what are the underlying assumptions

1322
01:10:49,599 --> 01:10:50,111
Is

1323
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:52,927
There will be a civil war if Trump

1324
01:10:53,183 --> 01:10:56,767
Continues to do what he's doing a little bit of a weird pretext

1325
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:01,887
Stop supporting Trump if you knew

1326
01:11:02,911 --> 01:11:04,959
Continuing to support him would be to the death

1327
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:07,519
Of blood say millions of Americans

1328
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:10,079
His

1329
01:11:10,591 --> 01:11:11,103
Difference

1330
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:12,383
Towards that will be

1331
01:11:12,639 --> 01:11:13,407
I know it's not

1332
01:11:13,919 --> 01:11:15,967
Beyond that your prediction

1333
01:11:16,223 --> 01:11:16,991
Whilst and Isaac

1334
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:18,015
And we'll see

1335
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:19,295
But

1336
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:22,111
Beyond that there's an important piece of Terrence

1337
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:22,879
Please bring up

1338
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:24,927
At the beginning

1339
01:11:25,183 --> 01:11:25,951
Be much more passionate

1340
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:29,791
Used to have like a fire in

1341
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:34,143
There's a

1342
01:11:34,655 --> 01:11:35,935
Keeping beating the same f******

1343
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:36,703
In Drumright

1344
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:37,983
Boring

1345
01:11:45,407 --> 01:11:48,735
It's more complex than that

1346
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:51,295
He said he really is challenging

1347
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:54,623
He's destroying their takeover plan of the US and the world

1348
01:11:55,135 --> 01:11:55,903
And

1349
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:57,695
They're trying to destroy him

1350
01:11:58,207 --> 01:12:00,255
And in the process

1351
01:12:08,447 --> 01:12:10,751
Loyalty

1352
01:12:11,007 --> 01:12:13,055
Because you know someone by their enemies

1353
01:12:13,311 --> 01:12:16,127
So is that a no

1354
01:12:17,407 --> 01:12:20,479
It's beyond that it's the fight

1355
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:24,063
You see how the globalist hate Trump

1356
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:26,367
Ilysm

1357
01:12:26,623 --> 01:12:29,695
Brazil

1358
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:35,071
Nationalism nationalism

1359
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:36,607
Africa

1360
01:12:36,863 --> 01:12:40,191
So like let's look at beyond the Brazil the strip mining

1361
01:12:40,447 --> 01:12:46,591
Of the world right now that was difficult but look at the world leader

1362
01:12:46,847 --> 01:12:48,895
Years that Alex Jones has been firmly in support of

1363
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:49,919
You kept

1364
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:51,455
Not good

1365
01:12:52,991 --> 01:12:54,527
Marine Le Pen

1366
01:12:54,783 --> 01:12:55,295
Not good

1367
01:12:55,551 --> 01:12:56,831
Geert Wilders

1368
01:12:57,343 --> 01:12:57,855
Not good

1369
01:12:58,367 --> 01:13:00,159
Nigel farage Rebecca

1370
01:13:00,415 --> 01:13:01,951
If you kept

1371
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:03,231
Hey

1372
01:13:03,487 --> 01:13:07,583
I think you just threw Tamara in there as well

1373
01:13:07,839 --> 01:13:08,607
A leader with a

1374
01:13:08,863 --> 01:13:10,399
A 5% approval rating

1375
01:13:10,655 --> 01:13:11,167
It's not good

1376
01:13:11,423 --> 01:13:12,447
Migrate

1377
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:14,239
Oh I also a leader who has

1378
01:13:14,495 --> 01:13:16,543
Literally been on tape committed crime

1379
01:13:17,055 --> 01:13:18,591
Who was not impeached for them

1380
01:13:18,847 --> 01:13:19,871
He was on tape

1381
01:13:20,383 --> 01:13:24,479
Unclear if he's

1382
01:13:24,735 --> 01:13:26,783
Supporting Camaro or

1383
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:27,551
Someone else

1384
01:13:29,855 --> 01:13:31,391
Could be any result might be Pele

1385
01:13:31,647 --> 01:13:32,927
I don't know

1386
01:13:35,487 --> 01:13:38,559
You haven't talked about that too much.

1387
01:13:38,815 --> 01:13:44,959
List movement the white nationalist government

1388
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:48,543
That you had on the show

1389
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:49,311
Have one

1390
01:13:49,567 --> 01:13:50,079
Connection

1391
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:51,103
And it's not

1392
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:53,151
Fighting's the globe

1393
01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:55,199
Be there soon

1394
01:13:55,711 --> 01:13:56,223
Are Dwight

1395
01:13:56,735 --> 01:13:57,247
Could have some

1396
01:13:57,759 --> 01:14:01,343
Not sure about that Brazil but the rest of them certainly absolutely

1397
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:02,367
Okay

1398
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:03,903
Brazil had one of the most

1399
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:04,671
Diverse

1400
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:05,439
Government

1401
01:14:05,951 --> 01:14:07,999
Until then

1402
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:09,791
Ramshackle

1403
01:14:10,047 --> 01:14:10,815
The

1404
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:12,607
Previous leader Dilma

1405
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:16,703
And installed an all-white government

1406
01:14:17,215 --> 01:14:19,519
Okay

1407
01:14:19,775 --> 01:14:22,079
Anyway we still are not sure how he's answering

1408
01:14:27,455 --> 01:14:30,015
You kept a perfect party does it mean

1409
01:14:31,295 --> 01:14:35,135
Parties in Eastern Europe away from the EU

1410
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:39,487
Global domination

1411
01:14:39,743 --> 01:14:42,815
Global with Worldwide

1412
01:14:43,839 --> 01:14:44,863
Organize tearing

1413
01:14:46,143 --> 01:14:47,167
They're the Opera

1414
01:14:47,423 --> 01:14:53,567
You always sound like he's trying to chew on something very weird whenever the camera goes away from it sounds like he's

1415
01:14:54,079 --> 01:14:55,359
Just taking a bite of a sandwich

1416
01:14:57,407 --> 01:14:58,943
Anyway

1417
01:14:59,455 --> 01:15:00,479
Are the biggest

1418
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:06,111
Sharks

1419
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:09,183
And that the fight is so close

1420
01:15:14,815 --> 01:15:17,375
Only halfway support Trump and not be such a big Target

1421
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:20,447
But I want to be just like he is

1422
01:15:20,959 --> 01:15:22,751
I want to give my full

1423
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:25,055
Effort and commitment

1424
01:15:26,335 --> 01:15:27,359
Measures

1425
01:15:28,127 --> 01:15:30,687
Amethyst

1426
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:33,503
I want my John Hancock on the Declaration of Independence

1427
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:43,999
They were sick of being rule

1428
01:15:44,255 --> 01:15:46,047
By an outside power

1429
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:50,143
They put on the line and they were successful and they were victorious

1430
01:15:52,703 --> 01:15:57,567
I smelled it 3 years ago you've seen happen

1431
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:09,343
The outside power

1432
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:25,727
So you don't really get Alex

1433
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:26,751
Myra Myra

1434
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:27,519
Responses

1435
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:30,847
The fuk you just sex yet

1436
01:16:31,103 --> 01:16:33,407
I'm certain Buckley came over to him in like

1437
01:16:33,663 --> 01:16:34,175
Dude

1438
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:35,967
First of all

1439
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:37,247
That was nothing

1440
01:16:37,503 --> 01:16:40,831
3 minutes of nothing

1441
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:41,855
You did not give

1442
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:43,391
Answer at all

1443
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:45,439
You didn't address

1444
01:16:45,951 --> 01:16:46,719
The important

1445
01:16:46,975 --> 01:16:47,999
Piece of that

1446
01:16:49,535 --> 01:16:50,815
Who had a critique of you

1447
01:16:51,583 --> 01:16:53,375
Which was it you used to be much more passion

1448
01:16:53,887 --> 01:16:55,935
Used to be before it was all this trouble

1449
01:16:58,751 --> 01:17:01,055
Alex comes back from commercial

1450
01:17:02,335 --> 01:17:03,615
We're going to see some false passion

1451
01:17:03,871 --> 01:17:04,639
Alright we're going to see

1452
01:17:04,895 --> 01:17:08,223
See some fake crying

1453
01:17:11,551 --> 01:17:13,087
How much symbols wealth

1454
01:17:13,343 --> 01:17:15,135
Or acting physically Tha Product

1455
01:17:15,647 --> 01:17:16,927
Is that what people think I don't know

1456
01:17:17,183 --> 01:17:22,815
This is right after their commercial

1457
01:17:23,839 --> 01:17:25,119
That's not what a man.

1458
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:26,911
Amanda's right

1459
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:46,623
Devil worship battle files

1460
01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:49,183
Call Jasmine

1461
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:54,815
It's not the lord's name in vain.

1462
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:57,119
I think that's the definition of the last name

1463
01:17:57,631 --> 01:17:59,935
Energy

1464
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:01,727
And everything I got

1465
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:09,663
He sounds

1466
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:10,943
Higher

1467
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:17,343
Mary Hart

1468
01:18:20,671 --> 01:18:24,255
They're a bunch of cowardly scum

1469
01:18:36,799 --> 01:18:40,383
Cuz they're always a bunch of confused knitting rudderless

1470
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:55,999
Where's mine answered you parents

1471
01:19:00,351 --> 01:19:06,495
Come out and say you had trouble going to blow your brains out I'd say pull the trigger

1472
01:19:06,751 --> 01:19:09,823
Democratic Party

1473
01:19:10,335 --> 01:19:12,895
No that wasn't them that was your ex-wife

1474
01:19:13,663 --> 01:19:14,431
Squishy

1475
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:19,295
I don't know I don't want to get mixed up in your ex-wife

1476
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:21,087
It was not the globalist

1477
01:19:21,343 --> 01:19:22,111
Or the Democrat

1478
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:25,183
So that was fake

1479
01:19:27,231 --> 01:19:30,815
NACA if you watch the video it's super hilarious just

1480
01:19:31,071 --> 01:19:34,143
Lexus choking back to your snowblower

1481
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:35,423
Epic say that

1482
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:40,287
Right now about

1483
01:19:41,311 --> 01:19:42,591
Doing all of those days

1484
01:19:43,103 --> 01:19:46,943
Because I fake crying about things

1485
01:19:47,455 --> 01:19:48,735
Bavarian Oculus

1486
01:19:51,551 --> 01:19:53,087
Terrance one more time

1487
01:19:53,343 --> 01:19:59,487
He's not done faking 12 minutes

1488
01:19:59,743 --> 01:20:01,023
Compassion

1489
01:20:03,071 --> 01:20:06,655
Really funny because it's where I heard the sound effect

1490
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:13,311
Sound effects that I believe

1491
01:20:13,567 --> 01:20:14,848
Sound of Alex taking

1492
01:20:15,104 --> 01:20:17,664
Some booze to the Head

1493
01:20:18,176 --> 01:20:19,456
Ooparts wanted happen

1494
01:20:22,016 --> 01:20:22,528
The shot

1495
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:24,064
Is what makes me think you was taking a

1496
01:20:29,184 --> 01:20:35,328
Because they're the globalists are the ones killing me

1497
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:43,264
Donald Trump

1498
01:20:50,432 --> 01:20:55,552
How to get the table.

1499
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:04,768
Bottle popping up

1500
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:06,560
I to high-class whiskey for me

1501
01:21:06,816 --> 01:21:11,168
Goodnight Circuit Court did not say that you can't have American flag in school this is same

1502
01:21:11,424 --> 01:21:14,240
What about that

1503
01:21:15,776 --> 01:21:19,360
Problem

1504
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:21,152
Classic

1505
01:21:24,736 --> 01:21:30,880
Yeah I would say you did and you know what thank you for the heart and your voice again I need to hear that

1506
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:35,744
I'm a strong man like you I'm a 27 year old male with a daughter

1507
01:21:36,256 --> 01:21:40,352
Is right there only 27 I heard the

1508
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:44,448
Yeah it was right there if you listen very carefully you can hear

1509
01:21:44,704 --> 01:21:48,032
It sounds exactly like someone breaking a highball

1510
01:21:48,544 --> 01:21:51,360
And sweet

1511
01:21:51,616 --> 01:21:52,128
He's 75

1512
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:58,016
Larry Nichols pretending to be 27

1513
01:21:58,272 --> 01:21:59,040
You used to have

1514
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:00,832
You go ahead and go

1515
01:22:01,856 --> 01:22:07,488
I heard that because he was faking it again

1516
01:22:07,744 --> 01:22:09,280
It's like

1517
01:22:09,536 --> 01:22:14,144
It's like a f****** Dueling Piano Bar getting over guy getting a request

1518
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:16,448
But Sookie takes that drink

1519
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:21,312
And like I said right before this what he said the caller ID says I'm a 27 year old man

1520
01:22:21,568 --> 01:22:22,336
I have a daughter

1521
01:22:22,848 --> 01:22:24,640
Listen to Alex's rejoinder

1522
01:22:24,896 --> 01:22:26,432
Which I'm certain indicates

1523
01:22:26,944 --> 01:22:28,480
Was not paying attention

1524
01:22:30,016 --> 01:22:33,088
I do think to myself now it's Jones

1525
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:35,648
The globalist can kill you

1526
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:40,768
Who cares about me who cares about you but my daughter's they threatened to kill my daughter

1527
01:22:41,792 --> 01:22:47,936
You respond to that

1528
01:22:57,664 --> 01:23:02,528
Arguing with Carol and daughter

1529
01:23:02,784 --> 01:23:08,928
So f*** it obvious that he thought

1530
01:23:10,208 --> 01:23:16,352
What are you saying they're actually real

1531
01:23:16,608 --> 01:23:18,912
Drinking a shot of whiskey used just like

1532
01:23:19,424 --> 01:23:19,936
Target

1533
01:23:22,496 --> 01:23:25,824
People anymore

1534
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:28,896
Why the f*** would they

1535
01:23:29,152 --> 01:23:29,920
From wherever

1536
01:23:31,456 --> 01:23:33,504
And so this is what

1537
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:35,296
No but if they did

1538
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:36,320
Imma Go Alex

1539
01:23:36,832 --> 01:23:37,344
Get back

1540
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:40,416
And if this is what's going on

1541
01:23:40,672 --> 01:23:45,024
If you have your heart

1542
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:49,888
Chubb

1543
01:23:52,704 --> 01:23:54,240
What the f***

1544
01:23:55,008 --> 01:24:01,152
Great advice if you don't want people to threaten to kill your daughter you have to let them know that you

1545
01:24:01,408 --> 01:24:03,712
Kill baby kill your daughter

1546
01:24:04,224 --> 01:24:04,736
School

1547
01:24:06,016 --> 01:24:07,808
I don't know how you would interact with them

1548
01:24:08,064 --> 01:24:09,856
Prior to

1549
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:13,696
Blankets

1550
01:24:17,536 --> 01:24:18,816
Franklin

1551
01:24:19,072 --> 01:24:20,096
Go to the

1552
01:24:20,608 --> 01:24:21,376
Get a seashell

1553
01:24:21,632 --> 01:24:23,936
Scream if you attack my daughter I'll kill you

1554
01:24:24,448 --> 01:24:25,216
They'll get it right

1555
01:24:25,472 --> 01:24:29,312
They'll get the message understand how Alex Jones

1556
01:24:29,568 --> 01:24:30,080
Can beat like

1557
01:24:30,592 --> 01:24:31,360
These moments

1558
01:24:32,128 --> 01:24:32,896
These moments

1559
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:33,920
That are like

1560
01:24:34,176 --> 01:24:34,688
There

1561
01:24:34,944 --> 01:24:35,712
Literally nothing

1562
01:24:35,968 --> 01:24:36,480
But there the moment

1563
01:24:36,736 --> 01:24:39,808
Breaking news episodes

1564
01:24:40,064 --> 01:24:41,088
The moments where

1565
01:24:41,344 --> 01:24:42,112
When he's

1566
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:44,672
Globalist threatened to murder your daughter

1567
01:24:44,928 --> 01:24:49,024
Brain for a second

1568
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:51,072
411

1569
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:57,984
This color somehow is important enough that these shadowy globalist with his daughter

1570
01:24:58,240 --> 01:24:59,520
If you wouldn't

1571
01:24:59,776 --> 01:25:01,056
4

1572
01:25:01,312 --> 01:25:01,824
He's like

1573
01:25:02,336 --> 01:25:04,128
Maybe maybe

1574
01:25:05,152 --> 01:25:05,664
My audience

1575
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:06,688
Still think that's

1576
01:25:06,944 --> 01:25:08,224
Rio

1577
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:11,552
What's going through his tonight

1578
01:25:11,808 --> 01:25:13,600
Maybe this guy's the right kind of crazy

1579
01:25:13,856 --> 01:25:15,904
For me and we can do a little improv game little

1580
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:22,304
Humana Network

1581
01:25:24,864 --> 01:25:25,888
I hate that the got cut off

1582
01:25:26,144 --> 01:25:30,240
Cut off

1583
01:25:30,496 --> 01:25:36,640
On the show weekly like

1584
01:25:36,896 --> 01:25:41,504
Questioning

1585
01:25:42,272 --> 01:25:43,552
There's just

1586
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:47,392
Assume is opportunistic mindset

1587
01:25:47,904 --> 01:25:49,952
Really one of the only Thrills eyeglasses

1588
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:52,000
Those moments

1589
01:25:52,256 --> 01:25:53,536
Way2go was killed

1590
01:25:56,864 --> 01:25:59,424
Are we boring to be at this point it's just so clear

1591
01:26:01,216 --> 01:26:02,240
Anyway Alex is taken

1592
01:26:04,032 --> 01:26:08,896
6 1/2 hours 37 hours

1593
01:26:09,152 --> 01:26:12,992
Might as well be that last call took

1594
01:26:13,248 --> 01:26:13,760
The better part of

1595
01:26:14,528 --> 01:26:16,320
Yeah because Alex kept screaming

1596
01:26:17,344 --> 01:26:17,856
Compassionate

1597
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:18,880
And all that

1598
01:26:19,904 --> 01:26:21,440
So then comes back for that commercial

1599
01:26:23,744 --> 01:26:29,376
Well I love

1600
01:26:29,632 --> 01:26:32,448
I got a ton of important Club

1601
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:37,824
Sorry you're exhausted

1602
01:26:38,848 --> 01:26:43,200
I don't know I don't know what is exhausting you about it maybe

1603
01:26:43,456 --> 01:26:45,760
Is your hecny performance

1604
01:26:46,016 --> 01:26:46,528
8

1605
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:47,296
Talking

1606
01:26:47,552 --> 01:26:48,320
Toothless people

1607
01:26:48,576 --> 01:26:49,088
I would

1608
01:26:49,344 --> 01:26:51,392
I think yeah I think you just hates it

1609
01:26:51,648 --> 01:26:54,464
Corner of having to either

1610
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:58,560
Get all of his energy up to fight back against it and

1611
01:26:58,816 --> 01:26:59,584
Or yes

1612
01:27:00,864 --> 01:27:03,680
Tristan whenever they're saying cuz they're a fan

1613
01:27:03,936 --> 01:27:07,008
You had a great question

1614
01:27:08,544 --> 01:27:14,688
Don't know what I really liked the first call that he had was a guy who

1615
01:27:14,944 --> 01:27:16,480
Brought up a couple of salient

1616
01:27:16,736 --> 01:27:17,248
It's about his past

1617
01:27:18,528 --> 01:27:20,064
But he's willing to lie in certain cage

1618
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:24,160
Right position on 180 degrees

1619
01:27:24,416 --> 01:27:25,696
Andy refuses to release

1620
01:27:25,952 --> 01:27:26,464
Financial

1621
01:27:26,976 --> 01:27:32,864
Those three things are really respond to any of them

1622
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:33,888
Do pretty serious attack

1623
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:36,448
It's okay

1624
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:38,240
That would be exhausting

1625
01:27:38,496 --> 01:27:40,288
Trying to figure that out on the Fly Right

1626
01:27:40,544 --> 01:27:43,104
Second caller is would give up Trump

1627
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:43,872
To save up

1628
01:27:44,128 --> 01:27:44,896
Save people's lives

1629
01:27:45,664 --> 01:27:46,176
And that

1630
01:27:46,688 --> 01:27:52,832
Daddy answer to that.

1631
01:27:53,088 --> 01:27:54,624
If you say yes I would

1632
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:57,184
You don't get to play the I would die for Trump

1633
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:59,232
He is what's going to save us from the globalist

1634
01:27:59,744 --> 01:28:05,888
Right no then you are complicit in whatever is going on the escalation of 10

1635
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:08,192
Between the left and the right and what have you

1636
01:28:08,704 --> 01:28:09,472
You are

1637
01:28:09,984 --> 01:28:11,776
You're a big part of it and you have to

1638
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:16,128
That question is also one you can't really answer straightforward and honest

1639
01:28:16,384 --> 01:28:19,712
But if he says he's already essentially answer that

1640
01:28:20,224 --> 01:28:21,760
Which is better

1641
01:28:27,904 --> 01:28:29,440
Something like that

1642
01:28:30,208 --> 01:28:30,720
Like what

1643
01:28:31,232 --> 01:28:37,376
Question because I don't know why that question is unanswerable

1644
01:28:37,632 --> 01:28:40,448
Will because there's a part of his brain and there's a part of

1645
01:28:40,704 --> 01:28:42,240
I mean I don't know maybe

1646
01:28:42,496 --> 01:28:43,008
Part of the

1647
01:28:43,264 --> 01:28:44,800
The Deep recesses of his audience

1648
01:28:45,056 --> 01:28:51,200
His brain still remembers that when Trump first started running Alex that I don't trust him he's a con

1649
01:28:52,736 --> 01:28:53,760
Turn on the East Coast

1650
01:28:54,016 --> 01:28:55,808
Like there is a part of him that knows

1651
01:28:56,064 --> 01:28:57,344
This is going to break bad

1652
01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:01,184
This isn't going to end well eventually all of these things

1653
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:02,720
These Financial Miss dealings

1654
01:29:03,232 --> 01:29:05,280
Let me see the ones that aren't already f****** public

1655
01:29:05,536 --> 01:29:09,632
The more serious ones that drop has been involved with eventually will come to light

1656
01:29:10,144 --> 01:29:11,424
And Alex is going to have

1657
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:13,216
Santa Bear for the fact that

1658
01:29:13,472 --> 01:29:16,032
He pretended that all that stuff wasn't true

1659
01:29:16,288 --> 01:29:20,384
Boxer Rodger Stone

1660
01:29:20,896 --> 01:29:22,688
He's eventually going to have to face

1661
01:29:22,944 --> 01:29:23,712
Music for that

1662
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:25,504
And I think that

1663
01:29:27,296 --> 01:29:28,832
Waffling around with a direct

1664
01:29:29,088 --> 01:29:29,600
Question

1665
01:29:30,112 --> 01:29:30,880
He's able to

1666
01:29:31,136 --> 01:29:34,208
To save himself a little bit of face eventually down the road

1667
01:29:34,464 --> 01:29:34,976
He's preparing

1668
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:39,584
Not nice not always

1669
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:41,632
Your name

1670
01:29:44,704 --> 01:29:46,496
I mean

1671
01:29:46,752 --> 01:29:48,288
If I were one of those guys

1672
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:49,824
And I

1673
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:50,592
The Flynn news

1674
01:29:50,848 --> 01:29:54,944
Like man like they're trying to get keep manafort from like

1675
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:56,992
They're trying to deny his bail

1676
01:29:57,248 --> 01:29:58,528
Because he's a player

1677
01:30:00,064 --> 01:30:00,832
Because of course he's

1678
01:30:01,856 --> 01:30:04,160
There's one country he's not going to Alabama

1679
01:30:04,928 --> 01:30:05,440
The United

1680
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:07,232
2 country

1681
01:30:07,488 --> 01:30:09,536
So it's like it's like there should be

1682
01:30:10,304 --> 01:30:12,608
You should be able to see the writing on the wall

1683
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:14,144
If you're one of those fat face

1684
01:30:15,424 --> 01:30:16,192
That closely aligned

1685
01:30:16,448 --> 01:30:21,568
And so you should have like a bug out bag at least right like these guys have to know what's going on

1686
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:23,872
They have to know that eventually it's going to come

1687
01:30:25,152 --> 01:30:25,664
Although

1688
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:26,432
Franklin

1689
01:30:26,688 --> 01:30:30,528
F*** it might not

1690
01:30:31,296 --> 01:30:33,600
I think that Alex probably realizes on some

1691
01:30:34,112 --> 01:30:35,136
Part of his brain

1692
01:30:36,928 --> 01:30:38,208
If all of it works out

1693
01:30:38,976 --> 01:30:39,744
He's an even worse

1694
01:30:41,024 --> 01:30:42,048
Because then I mean

1695
01:30:43,328 --> 01:30:44,864
Is net neutrality go through

1696
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:46,144
You going to lose most

1697
01:30:47,424 --> 01:30:48,704
Because most people

1698
01:30:49,472 --> 01:30:51,008
With without being

1699
01:30:52,544 --> 01:30:53,056
Cruel

1700
01:30:53,568 --> 01:30:54,592
Most of his audience

1701
01:30:54,848 --> 01:30:55,616
Can barely afford.

1702
01:30:56,384 --> 01:30:59,968
Them at all

1703
01:31:00,224 --> 01:31:02,528
A lot of them live in Crazy Royal areas

1704
01:31:02,784 --> 01:31:04,064
They don't have good service with

1705
01:31:04,576 --> 01:31:07,136
Write a lot of those places are going to have

1706
01:31:07,392 --> 01:31:08,160
No coverage

1707
01:31:08,416 --> 01:31:09,696
Well

1708
01:31:12,768 --> 01:31:14,304
Well it's going to

1709
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:17,120
Be even worse like all of that is going to

1710
01:31:17,376 --> 01:31:18,400
Pylon it pylon

1711
01:31:18,656 --> 01:31:19,168
He's going to

1712
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:20,960
New prophets dwindled to almost

1713
01:31:21,728 --> 01:31:22,496
Unless

1714
01:31:23,008 --> 01:31:28,640
You know there is a despotic official

1715
01:31:32,992 --> 01:31:35,296
But I mean like

1716
01:31:35,552 --> 01:31:36,064
Does really dark

1717
01:31:37,088 --> 01:31:37,856
He doesn't realize

1718
01:31:38,368 --> 01:31:39,648
He doesn't realize how much

1719
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:41,696
The position is advocating for

1720
01:31:41,952 --> 01:31:42,720
Are going to

1721
01:31:42,976 --> 01:31:43,488
Buckhannon

1722
01:31:46,048 --> 01:31:48,352
He should have been briefed on how net neutrality

1723
01:31:49,376 --> 01:31:51,936
But like if he's if he's doesn't read articles

1724
01:31:52,192 --> 01:31:53,472
I know but he should have

1725
01:31:53,728 --> 01:31:54,240
Somebody

1726
01:31:54,752 --> 01:31:56,288
He's like he doesn't take brief

1727
01:31:56,544 --> 01:31:58,080
Show me if somebody who does

1728
01:31:58,336 --> 01:32:01,664
Because everybody should have been United

1729
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:04,480
For net neutrality except for the Telecom

1730
01:32:04,992 --> 01:32:07,040
Like it should have been 100% of

1731
01:32:07,552 --> 01:32:11,904
Speaks to the possibility of getting big dark money

1732
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:14,208
Yeah he could pay for the

1733
01:32:14,976 --> 01:32:19,072
Comcast

1734
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:20,864
Tell the truth when they say

1735
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:21,632
Said they were

1736
01:32:22,912 --> 01:32:23,680
There is that

1737
01:32:23,936 --> 01:32:24,960
You are nice

1738
01:32:25,216 --> 01:32:28,032
But also the people who would be dictating the position

1739
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:29,824
Or you know

1740
01:32:30,592 --> 01:32:31,104
Subtly

1741
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:31,872
Influencing

1742
01:32:32,128 --> 01:32:32,640
The positions

1743
01:32:33,152 --> 01:32:34,688
Would be interested

1744
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:37,760
Say that

1745
01:32:38,272 --> 01:32:39,040
Like

1746
01:32:39,552 --> 01:32:40,064
It's not that

1747
01:32:41,344 --> 01:32:42,880
Takeover of the media

1748
01:32:43,136 --> 01:32:43,648
Yeah but

1749
01:32:44,416 --> 01:32:44,928
They're going to

1750
01:32:45,184 --> 01:32:46,464
They're going to bail on him when they can

1751
01:32:47,232 --> 01:32:48,512
Totally I would

1752
01:32:49,792 --> 01:32:53,120
I'm looking for

1753
01:32:53,888 --> 01:32:54,912
Anyway

1754
01:32:55,168 --> 01:32:56,448
So

1755
01:32:58,752 --> 01:33:00,800
There's a lot of rambling

1756
01:33:01,312 --> 01:33:03,616
There's a lot that goes on

1757
01:33:04,128 --> 01:33:08,736
Do you like another 6 minutes or so until we get to the next call

1758
01:33:10,016 --> 01:33:10,784
Do you think this one's going

1759
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:11,808
Be critical role

1760
01:33:12,064 --> 01:33:13,600
Supportive

1761
01:33:13,856 --> 01:33:15,136
Relatively critical in a row

1762
01:33:15,392 --> 01:33:18,720
The second critical one was supportive but just

1763
01:33:18,976 --> 01:33:21,024
Yeah I accidentally tough request

1764
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:22,816
I thought he was at

1765
01:33:24,352 --> 01:33:25,376
So let's go with

1766
01:33:28,192 --> 01:33:30,496
Idaho Central hauling around here

1767
01:33:32,032 --> 01:33:33,312
Yes I am

1768
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:36,640
So

1772
01:33:44,064 --> 01:33:45,344
Irish English

1773
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:46,112
German

1774
01:33:46,624 --> 01:33:47,136
Friends

1775
01:33:47,648 --> 01:33:48,928
Indian

1776
01:33:49,184 --> 01:33:49,952
Whatever

1777
01:33:51,488 --> 01:33:53,792
K

1778
01:33:54,816 --> 01:33:55,328
You're drunk

1779
01:33:56,608 --> 01:33:59,680
Okay

1780
01:34:02,752 --> 01:34:03,264
No

1781
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:04,288
I don't

1782
01:34:07,872 --> 01:34:08,640
If I can

1783
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:11,712
A little bit

1784
01:34:16,064 --> 01:34:17,344
Polish agency

1785
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:25,024
Friends.

1786
01:34:30,656 --> 01:34:34,496
Big Lebowski all polish come

1787
01:34:36,544 --> 01:34:41,408
Ashley

1788
01:34:50,368 --> 01:34:53,440
People tell pesobic that he must be a Russian agent cuz he's probably

1789
01:34:54,464 --> 01:34:54,976
There's other reasons

1790
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:02,912
There's just a lot of things

1791
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:08,032
I'm just having fun with you sorry

1792
01:35:15,968 --> 01:35:18,016
Well I got it

1793
01:35:18,784 --> 01:35:21,088
Deposit there because you cannot talk over there

1794
01:35:21,856 --> 01:35:22,880
We cannot even laugh over there

1795
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:28,512
Well I got it

1796
01:35:28,768 --> 01:35:32,864
You're something else I got to go at caller some Crystal ridiculous

1797
01:35:33,632 --> 01:35:37,216
Everything I know about Alex Jones

1798
01:35:38,496 --> 01:35:43,616
Whatever Alex immediately says

1799
01:35:46,944 --> 01:35:48,224
Any any numbers

1800
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:51,552
That's who cop-out for oats

1801
01:35:52,064 --> 01:35:54,368
Alex probably takes a lot of pain

1802
01:35:55,392 --> 01:35:58,720
Possible

1803
01:35:58,976 --> 01:36:00,000
Insinuations

1804
01:36:00,256 --> 01:36:02,304
Suggestions from the chat room that is on amphetamine

1805
01:36:02,816 --> 01:36:05,888
Okay that's possible but I think that also could just be the brain Force

1806
01:36:06,144 --> 01:36:08,704
Because he has said that there are

1807
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:10,496
New product the red pill

1808
01:36:11,008 --> 01:36:12,544
There's no stimuli

1809
01:36:13,056 --> 01:36:14,336
But there are in

1810
01:36:16,896 --> 01:36:19,712
Yeah I don't know

1811
01:36:20,736 --> 01:36:21,248
Consumption

1812
01:36:22,016 --> 01:36:23,808
I don't know I think it'd be a lot more

1813
01:36:25,088 --> 01:36:25,600
Not as

1814
01:36:25,856 --> 01:36:27,392
Tired

1815
01:36:27,648 --> 01:36:28,160
As Alyssa

1816
01:36:29,184 --> 01:36:30,720
Peter just seems like

1817
01:36:30,976 --> 01:36:32,512
Yeah he's got a baby

1818
01:36:32,768 --> 01:36:33,536
Please like

1819
01:36:34,816 --> 01:36:36,864
He's either high or he

1820
01:36:38,656 --> 01:36:40,448
If that's a bad prank call

1821
01:36:40,704 --> 01:36:41,472
Going to mean

1822
01:36:41,728 --> 01:36:42,496
There's a there's a

1823
01:36:42,752 --> 01:36:44,544
If you're just walking around if you can do better than that

1824
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:46,080
If you're drunk maybe not

1825
01:36:46,592 --> 01:36:47,616
Anyway

1826
01:36:47,872 --> 01:36:48,640
Critique of the calls

1827
01:36:55,296 --> 01:36:56,320
Not most insightful

1828
01:36:56,576 --> 01:36:57,088
Okay

1829
01:36:57,344 --> 01:37:00,160
Okay

1830
01:37:02,976 --> 01:37:03,744
He's taking three calls

1831
01:37:04,512 --> 01:37:05,536
Well he's covered his bases

1832
01:37:10,656 --> 01:37:12,448
Move on

1833
01:37:12,704 --> 01:37:14,496
Samantha questions

1834
01:37:17,312 --> 01:37:20,128
My fault I apologize we're going your calls

1835
01:37:20,640 --> 01:37:23,968
At least the cops to it's my fault there long

1836
01:37:25,504 --> 01:37:26,016
Question

1837
01:37:26,272 --> 01:37:26,784
Like

1838
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:30,112
Literally every single one of you did except for Peter who is high

1839
01:37:32,928 --> 01:37:34,720
The calls would be really short

1840
01:37:34,976 --> 01:37:36,000
If you didn't scream

1841
01:37:36,256 --> 01:37:37,280
Performative

1842
01:37:37,536 --> 01:37:38,816
For half an hour

1843
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:41,888
Was

1844
01:37:42,144 --> 01:37:43,424
Would you give up Trump

1845
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:44,192
Because he's

1846
01:37:44,704 --> 01:37:45,728
Just one part of the fight against

1847
01:37:45,984 --> 01:37:46,496
The globalist

1848
01:37:47,008 --> 01:37:49,312
Yep all right

1849
01:37:57,248 --> 01:37:59,808
Need to go through it but the guys talking about how

1850
01:38:00,064 --> 01:38:00,576
Christian

1851
01:38:00,832 --> 01:38:02,368
Christianity matters

1852
01:38:04,416 --> 01:38:04,928
Christian

1853
01:38:05,184 --> 01:38:07,488
The Bible

1854
01:38:07,744 --> 01:38:13,888
God judges the heart David got his best friend killed just have sex with his wife

1855
01:38:20,544 --> 01:38:22,336
But behind closed doors are super cool

1856
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:31,552
Not they were perfect

1857
01:38:34,368 --> 01:38:36,672
He was a horrible person

1858
01:38:36,928 --> 01:38:40,512
Teaser for real guy

1859
01:38:40,768 --> 01:38:42,304
He's out the openings not perfect

1860
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:45,376
But he really isn't out to get people

1861
01:38:45,632 --> 01:38:49,216
He doesn't want austerity

1862
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:55,872
So what are the what are the defining characteristics of King David and Saul become

1863
01:38:56,128 --> 01:38:57,408
Call

1864
01:38:57,664 --> 01:38:58,432
Doesn't relate

1865
01:38:58,688 --> 01:38:59,968
Trump boat from Tarzan

1866
01:39:02,784 --> 01:39:03,808
They change

1867
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:04,832
Still get it

1868
01:39:05,856 --> 01:39:07,648
The point of those stories

1869
01:39:07,904 --> 01:39:12,768
Is recognizing the error of your ways and having a transformative moment

1870
01:39:13,024 --> 01:39:13,536
Try one more time

1871
01:39:14,048 --> 01:39:20,192
On the road English the roads are you say about the road to Damascus

1872
01:39:20,448 --> 01:39:23,264
French

1873
01:39:24,032 --> 01:39:29,664
Very specifically the point of the stories is that they were bad and they had a coming to

1874
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:30,432
Jesus moment

1875
01:39:30,688 --> 01:39:31,968
The transformed them

1876
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:33,504
In every way

1877
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:35,296
Everything about them

1878
01:39:35,552 --> 01:39:36,064
They weren't

1879
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:38,624
The same people that didn't hang out with the same people

1880
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:40,672
They change their mode of being

1881
01:39:40,928 --> 01:39:46,048
Well if y'all told Trump about anything you know that

1882
01:39:51,424 --> 01:39:52,704
A change from

1883
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:54,240
I assume

1884
01:39:56,544 --> 01:40:00,896
Okay he blossomed like a butterfly into the sociopathic monster he has been

1885
01:40:01,152 --> 01:40:04,992
Since the age of nine that's it and I mean that's an interesting theory that he is

1886
01:40:05,248 --> 01:40:08,320
Road to Damascus moment was at age

1887
01:40:08,832 --> 01:40:10,368
3

1888
01:40:11,904 --> 01:40:18,048
Maybe maybe he will In that clip

1889
01:40:18,304 --> 01:40:20,352
Even is he saying you know like

1890
01:40:20,864 --> 01:40:21,376
David

1891
01:40:22,144 --> 01:40:22,656
Saw

1892
01:40:23,424 --> 01:40:29,056
Humbled even bad to begin with better than King David

1893
01:40:31,872 --> 01:40:34,176
Never killed his wife Mary's ever killed his friend's wife

1894
01:40:34,688 --> 01:40:36,224
Kill this friend

1895
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:36,992
Tupac his wife

1896
01:40:37,504 --> 01:40:40,064
Beat the s*** out of his wife

1897
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:42,112
Apparently

1898
01:40:43,392 --> 01:40:44,416
Mayor made out of insects

1899
01:40:44,672 --> 01:40:46,976
His daughter

1900
01:40:47,488 --> 01:40:48,768
That's true that is in the Bible

1901
01:40:49,024 --> 01:40:50,304
Yeah but then the daughter was at fault

1902
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:51,840
King David killed his daughter

1903
01:40:54,144 --> 01:40:55,168
So at this point Alex

1904
01:40:55,424 --> 01:40:57,728
This is like alright we had a great call

1905
01:40:57,984 --> 01:40:58,496
Maybe it's going to work

1906
01:40:58,752 --> 01:41:00,288
Workout

1907
01:41:00,544 --> 01:41:01,312
Let's try one more

1908
01:41:01,568 --> 01:41:04,384
Let's Roll

1909
01:41:07,712 --> 01:41:08,224
I don't answer

1910
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:14,368
I just tried hung up on a different color

1911
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:15,392
Okay

1912
01:41:15,648 --> 01:41:20,256
I don't know what's going on

1913
01:41:25,632 --> 01:41:30,496
I love your show and I have trouble listening to it because you're at doesn't work with iOS 11

1914
01:41:32,288 --> 01:41:34,336
I hear you Brothers want stuff done work around here

1915
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:41,248
That's delightful

1916
01:41:41,504 --> 01:41:42,272
So good

1917
01:41:42,528 --> 01:41:43,040
Alex

1918
01:41:43,296 --> 01:41:45,600
I have to text support questions for you

1919
01:41:46,624 --> 01:41:48,928
Here's what I disagree with you on

1920
01:41:49,184 --> 01:41:51,744
Update iOS

1921
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:56,096
All these questions should be directed to Rob do

1922
01:41:56,352 --> 01:41:58,656
Even heard around here

1923
01:41:58,912 --> 01:41:59,424
This

1924
01:42:01,216 --> 01:42:01,984
This leaves

1925
01:42:02,752 --> 01:42:04,800
Infowars

1926
01:42:05,056 --> 01:42:06,336
Listeners are the smartest

1927
01:42:07,104 --> 01:42:12,480
Absolutely this leads to at least seven minutes of a rambling about how like

1928
01:42:13,504 --> 01:42:14,272
I have tried

1929
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:15,808
So hard

1930
01:42:16,064 --> 01:42:16,576
To get that app

1931
01:42:20,416 --> 01:42:24,256
He claimed globalist plot

1932
01:42:24,512 --> 01:42:30,656
How many leftists in the tech world

1933
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:33,728
Nonsense

1934
01:42:35,776 --> 01:42:37,056
I paid someone

1935
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:38,848
Hundred dollars

1936
01:42:39,104 --> 01:42:40,128
The make that app

1937
01:42:46,016 --> 01:42:46,528
Anyone

1938
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:49,600
Is very weird

1939
01:42:49,856 --> 01:42:50,880
Besides at that point

1940
01:42:51,392 --> 01:42:51,904
Donald call

1941
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:58,304
I have too much news to get through

1942
01:42:58,816 --> 01:42:59,328
To get through

1943
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:03,680
Snooze

1944
01:43:03,936 --> 01:43:05,728
So a lot of you survive

1945
01:43:05,984 --> 01:43:08,288
A lot of time is taken up complaining

1946
01:43:08,544 --> 01:43:09,056
About

1947
01:43:09,312 --> 01:43:10,336
Muslims raping

1948
01:43:10,848 --> 01:43:12,384
Sweden is that narrative

1949
01:43:12,896 --> 01:43:14,432
Is tired

1950
01:43:15,456 --> 01:43:19,552
David

1951
01:43:20,832 --> 01:43:21,344
Maybe

1952
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:23,392
Alan dershowitz

1953
01:43:23,648 --> 01:43:24,160
Excuse me

1954
01:43:24,672 --> 01:43:25,440
David Horowitz

1955
01:43:25,696 --> 01:43:26,208
It is a very different

1956
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:29,280
But he has he has a dershowitz clip

1957
01:43:29,536 --> 01:43:34,400
Give me argument that

1958
01:43:34,912 --> 01:43:36,960
Muller has shown that he has nothing

1959
01:43:37,472 --> 01:43:38,240
Because of this in type

1960
01:43:38,752 --> 01:43:43,104
All he could get him on was this

1961
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:45,152
Lying to FBI

1962
01:43:45,408 --> 01:43:46,688
And now if that is

1963
01:43:46,944 --> 01:43:49,248
Which I don't believe it is I believe it's

1964
01:43:50,016 --> 01:43:50,528
But

1965
01:43:50,784 --> 01:43:52,832
Again I can't prove that that's just my

1966
01:43:53,344 --> 01:43:55,392
If it is true that

1967
01:43:55,648 --> 01:44:00,256
Five years in prison

1968
01:44:00,768 --> 01:44:01,536
So

1969
01:44:02,304 --> 01:44:06,144
Not enough not not terrible but at this point in his life you don't want to do that

1970
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:07,424
I don't think

1971
01:44:09,472 --> 01:44:09,984
Thighs

1972
01:44:10,240 --> 01:44:10,752
Right

1973
01:44:11,008 --> 01:44:12,288
Ball it seems it

1974
01:44:12,544 --> 01:44:17,920
Calls it seems unlikely the other bringing up in the clip is

1975
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:19,968
Because

1976
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:22,784
Flynn has been shown to be a liar

1977
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:24,576
He's not going to be a good Witness

1978
01:44:24,832 --> 01:44:25,344
Slater

1979
01:44:25,856 --> 01:44:27,648
For anything that you might be proper

1980
01:44:30,208 --> 01:44:34,816
Maybe but that's also super interesting to me because one of the other things that belies is

1981
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:39,168
Almost the entirety of Alex Jones is narrative that

1982
01:44:39,424 --> 01:44:40,960
Do you know Hillary and Obama

1983
01:44:41,472 --> 01:44:42,240
Fund Isis

1984
01:44:43,008 --> 01:44:45,568
Is based on Michael Flynn appearing on foreign

1985
01:44:46,848 --> 01:44:47,360
Same thing

1986
01:44:47,616 --> 01:44:48,128
To that effect

1987
01:44:48,896 --> 01:44:51,968
So is Alex Jones wants to play the game but Mike Flynn

1988
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:54,016
It's not going to be a credible Witness

1989
01:44:54,784 --> 01:44:56,832
You might have to re-examine some of the Bedrock

1990
01:44:57,088 --> 01:44:57,600
If your

1991
01:44:57,856 --> 01:44:58,368
Narrative

1992
01:44:58,624 --> 01:44:59,136
You know

1993
01:44:59,392 --> 01:45:00,160
It's not important

1994
01:45:00,416 --> 01:45:00,928
It's not a boy

1995
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:07,840
Alright let's get to this next week cuz this is one of the other news stories

1996
01:45:08,096 --> 01:45:08,608
He's got to get to

1997
01:45:15,008 --> 01:45:21,152
Most racist crap I've ever heard and they're just speak

1998
01:45:29,344 --> 01:45:32,672
Dogs are racist

1999
01:45:33,952 --> 01:45:38,816
Is being raised by a black family is around lot of white folks in my park at you cuz if not used to your phone

2000
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:49,824
This is getting crazy

2001
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:51,872
Cool

2002
01:45:52,384 --> 01:45:53,152
The point is

2003
01:45:53,408 --> 01:45:56,736
No.

2004
01:45:56,992 --> 01:45:57,504
Crazy

2005
01:45:57,760 --> 01:45:58,528
Pointers

2006
01:45:59,040 --> 01:45:59,552
Ship going why

2007
01:46:00,064 --> 01:46:01,344
So like okay let's take

2008
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:03,392
Just the first and most obvious

2009
01:46:04,928 --> 01:46:07,232
Who is Nick Cannon

2010
01:46:07,488 --> 01:46:09,536
Cuz this is wild now he's making it like

2011
01:46:09,792 --> 01:46:13,376
Even in his brains you can't go to like white people made a dog racist

2012
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:19,008
Bart it's not racism

2013
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:24,384
So you flashes up on screen the article so I know exactly what it was was able to hunt it down

2014
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:26,176
It is an article

2015
01:46:26,432 --> 01:46:28,992
From January 3rd 2013

2016
01:46:29,248 --> 01:46:33,856
Right on time why are dogs racist K9 experts speak

2017

4 years ago

2018
01:46:35,904 --> 01:46:36,416
Gawker

2019
01:46:36,672 --> 01:46:37,952
It is no longer website

2020
01:46:38,208 --> 01:46:40,000
Website

2021
01:46:42,048 --> 01:46:42,816
You know the time frame

2022
01:46:47,168 --> 01:46:47,936
Halo

2023
01:46:48,192 --> 01:46:48,960
Snarling and biting

2024
01:46:49,216 --> 01:46:51,264
It's been a source of uncomfortable comedy for years

2025
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:52,544
Some dogs are just

2026
01:46:53,056 --> 01:46:53,824
But why

2027
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:57,408

2028
01:46:58,176 --> 01:47:00,224

Oh okay with one person with a credit

All appear to be racist that's not possible

2034
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:24,544
Racism requires complex thinking and other higher cognitive functions to Canine simply.

2035
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:25,312
Don't possess

2036
01:47:25,568 --> 01:47:26,592
Her answer is

2037
01:47:27,104 --> 01:47:29,152
It's a f****** dog

2038
01:47:29,408 --> 01:47:35,552
Adult May react in fear-based aggression to a person of color for two reasons one insufficient positive Association in early

2039
01:47:35,808 --> 01:47:36,320
Socialization

2040
01:47:36,576 --> 01:47:37,088
People evolve

2041
01:47:37,856 --> 01:47:39,648
Or to a traumatic incident with a person

2042
01:47:39,904 --> 01:47:43,488
Color that is now generalized all people of color Alex

2043
01:47:44,768 --> 01:47:46,048
Sounds like Alex is a dog

2044
01:47:48,096 --> 01:47:48,864
And it's pretty much

2045
01:47:49,120 --> 01:47:50,912
Her answer is

2046
01:47:51,168 --> 01:47:53,728
Dog

2047
01:47:53,984 --> 01:47:55,776
Colorado's own dog whisperer

2048
01:47:56,032 --> 01:47:58,592
That's alright her title

2049
01:48:00,128 --> 01:48:02,944
!

2050
01:48:05,248 --> 01:48:11,136
Let's

2051
01:48:11,392 --> 01:48:12,160
You seem to like some dark skin

2052
01:48:12,928 --> 01:48:13,696
Very few cases

2053
01:48:13,952 --> 01:48:14,464
Is a dog's tongue

2054
01:48:14,720 --> 01:48:15,488
This like lightskins

2055
01:48:15,744 --> 01:48:16,256
People are reported

2056
01:48:17,536 --> 01:48:18,816
Your example.

2057
01:48:19,584 --> 01:48:21,120
Is not that bad

2058
01:48:21,632 --> 01:48:22,400
That goes on to say

2059
01:48:22,912 --> 01:48:23,424
Dark Knight Rises

2060
01:48:24,192 --> 01:48:30,336

Quick question

2063
01:48:34,432 --> 01:48:35,712
Can dogs commit blood libel

2064
01:48:35,968 --> 01:48:36,992
Yeah oh yeah

2065
01:48:37,248 --> 01:48:38,272
I saw an article on docker

2066
01:48:42,112 --> 01:48:43,904
So update that reference

2067
01:48:45,952 --> 01:48:47,232

2073
01:49:15,392 --> 01:49:17,952
The future but now

2074
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:21,024
2 trillion in overseas money

2075
01:49:21,792 --> 01:49:24,864
And bring back trillions to the middle class and poor taxpayers

2076
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:30,752
Is going to cause a giant booming economy

2077
01:49:31,008 --> 01:49:36,384
Most analysts say and 10% growth rates

2078
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:39,456
12%

2079
01:49:40,736 --> 01:49:42,016
Is that going to be good neighbors

2080
01:49:46,624 --> 01:49:48,672
For the Republic

2081
01:49:56,608 --> 01:49:57,632
Free-spending

2082
01:49:59,680 --> 01:50:01,984
It'll create a big deficit like that one right

2083
01:50:02,240 --> 01:50:04,032
I never got the cut

2084
01:50:04,544 --> 01:50:10,688
You got a free suspending then you cut taxes more money comes in generally because it's Thursday economy

2085
01:50:11,200 --> 01:50:13,760
Then you pay down the debt with that

2086
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:26,048
There's a lot of stuff at play there I think one of the things at the end

2087
01:50:26,304 --> 01:50:32,448
Is the idea that it's like these tax cuts and we have to get rid of all of these programs and stuff

2088
01:50:32,704 --> 01:50:36,288
Do it right behind those tax cuts

2089
01:50:36,544 --> 01:50:40,640
This is one to give more money to the rich people into to get rid of all entitlement spending

2090
01:50:40,896 --> 01:50:43,456

2108
01:51:26,976 --> 01:51:28,256
1%

Flipping a thousand dollars extra that's only going to last for the first

2113
01:51:40,032 --> 01:51:43,104
Forfeit

2114

I could have gone on

2124
01:52:13,312 --> 01:52:18,176
I wanted to start in the Reagan Era and then go through how the Democrats have failed

2125
01:52:18,432 --> 01:52:19,200
Entire situation

2126
01:52:19,456 --> 01:52:21,504

01:54:27,712 --> 01:54:28,480
Most of what you're saying

2170
01:54:29,504 --> 01:54:30,272

01:54:51,008 --> 01:54:52,544
These tax cuts are great

2176
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:57,152

2177
01:54:57,664 --> 01:55:00,224
I want to accidentally showing his cards on

2180
01:55:02,528 --> 01:55:03,808
The tax cuts aren't going

2181
01:55:04,064 --> 01:55:06,624
Do anything they're going to get rich people more money

2182
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:09,696
What is going to save money is taking away things from

2183
01:55:10,464 --> 01:55:11,232
Because you are.

2184
01:55:11,488 --> 01:55:14,048
Depriving them of things that already cost a ton of money

2185
01:55:14,560 --> 01:55:17,376
All that money that the rich people are going to save Incorporation

2186
01:55:17,632 --> 01:55:18,656
They're going to save

It's not going anywhere

2190
01:55:25,824 --> 01:55:27,872
What it's going to do is it's going to stay

2191
01:55:28,128 --> 01:55:28,640
Outside

2192
01:55:29,152 --> 01:55:30,176

01:55:32,736 --> 01:55:37,856
Entirely about stripping what generates money for the

2196
01:55:42,976 --> 01:55:43,744
Spend that money

2197
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,048
The wealthy don't spend money

2198
01:55:46,304 --> 01:55:46,816
Hoard

2199
01:55:51,424 --> 01:55:52,192
The speculation in

2200
01:55:52,448 --> 01:55:54,752
It's not something that

2201
01:55:55,008 --> 01:55:57,568
Real it's not something that actually goes towards building

2202
01:55:58,080 --> 01:55:58,848
If you want

2203
01:55:59,360 --> 01:55:59,872
How

2204
01:56:00,128 --> 01:56:05,504
How is it going invest in a bombing popshop in the stock market

Listen to a crazy man ramble it's a small business

2216
01:56:34,432 --> 01:56:37,504
Small business

2217
01:56:39,808 --> 01:56:43,136
Run by an individual

2218
01:56:43,392 --> 01:56:45,440

Employees there were like 50

Or something like that

2227
01:56:59,264 --> 01:57:00,800
It is a small business

2228
01:57:01,312 --> 01:57:02,336
They were bringing in

2229
01:57:02,592 --> 01:57:06,688
No it in the Realms of a couple million a year or something along those lines

2230
01:57:07,200 --> 01:57:08,992
It is not a publicly traded company

2231
01:57:09,248 --> 01:57:11,808

2241
01:57:35,104 --> 01:57:36,640
The middle class growing

2242
01:57:36,896 --> 01:57:39,200
The ability for them to give me a raise

2243
01:57:39,456 --> 01:57:41,760
Wouldn't be helped by the

2244
01:57:42,784 --> 01:57:45,856
Everything is incentivize them

2245
01:57:46,112 --> 01:57:47,392
Do not cover

2246
01:57:49,696 --> 01:57:50,720
And even if the

2247
01:57:51,232 --> 01:57:52,000
The guy who ran the

2248
01:57:52,768 --> 01:57:53,280
Was

2249
01:57:53,536 --> 01:57:54,560
Cuz one of the big things

2250
01:57:55,328 --> 01:57:55,840
Play lower with

2251
01:57:56,864 --> 01:57:59,168
Right through rate goes from 35

2252
01:58:00,704 --> 01:58:01,216
Which is

2253
01:58:03,008 --> 01:58:04,032
Because a lot of the come

2254
01:58:05,824 --> 01:58:06,848
Our

2255
01:58:07,360 --> 01:58:08,128
Are those

2256
01:58:08,896 --> 01:58:10,944
They classified the investment Banks

2257
01:58:11,712 --> 01:58:12,224
As

2258
01:58:12,480 --> 01:58:12,992
This dude

2259
01:58:13,760 --> 01:58:14,272
As opposed to

2260
01:58:15,808 --> 01:58:16,576
You lower that.

2261
01:58:17,344 --> 01:58:21,184
Like I said even if that guy is doing that that guy is running the past

2262
01:58:21,952 --> 01:58:24,256
He's not going to get a ton of money back

2263
01:58:24,768 --> 01:58:26,816
It's not going to be a huge amount for

2264
01:58:27,072 --> 01:58:27,840
For him

2265
01:58:28,096 --> 01:58:28,864
But some people

2266
01:58:29,376 --> 01:58:29,888
It will be

2267
01:58:30,912 --> 01:58:31,936
Congratulations

2268
01:58:32,960 --> 01:58:39,104
Great we live in a world where this has to be a reality

2269
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:43,456
Pretty much all of our national parks

2270
01:58:43,968 --> 01:58:45,248
And stuff probably are,

2271
01:58:45,504 --> 01:58:49,344
Is going to win

2272
01:58:50,368 --> 01:58:50,880
Know this

2273
01:58:51,392 --> 01:58:52,160
This cast

2274
01:58:53,440 --> 01:58:56,256
This can't continue there's

2275
01:58:56,512 --> 01:58:57,792
Not in just a this

2276
01:58:58,304 --> 01:58:59,072
Continue like a

2277
01:59:00,096 --> 01:59:00,864
This is so bad

2278
01:59:01,120 --> 01:59:01,632
We can't allow this

2279
01:59:01,888 --> 01:59:02,912
Continue I mean it's a no

2280
01:59:03,936 --> 01:59:05,472
Everytime this

2281
01:59:05,728 --> 01:59:07,008
Has been done there has been a

2282
01:59:07,264 --> 01:59:08,544
A crash there will be

2283
01:59:08,800 --> 01:59:13,920
A crap because of the difficulty that will come after that is that

2284
01:59:14,688 --> 01:59:16,736
Difficult Economic Times

2285
01:59:17,504 --> 01:59:21,600
I mean the disparaging the difference between the Haves and Have Nots

2286
01:59:21,856 --> 01:59:23,904
Is unsustainable to

2287
01:59:24,160 --> 01:59:24,672
It's very serious

2288
01:59:24,928 --> 01:59:26,208
Disagree and it causes

2289
01:59:26,976 --> 01:59:30,048
Societies fall apart when they fall apart

2290
01:59:30,304 --> 01:59:31,584
Everybody has nothing

2291
01:59:32,608 --> 01:59:33,376
That's when fascism

2292
01:59:33,632 --> 01:59:34,144
Takes old

2293
01:59:34,656 --> 01:59:37,984
That is when you have to really be worried about these things

2294
01:59:38,240 --> 01:59:44,384
Blood libel narrative

2295
01:59:44,640 --> 01:59:46,432
Evitable finger with these tax cuts

2296
01:59:46,688 --> 01:59:48,736
With the direction everything is going is

2297
01:59:49,248 --> 01:59:50,272
A bubble burst

2298
01:59:51,040 --> 01:59:54,112
Cuz there's a lot of artificial into the azzam

2299
01:59:54,368 --> 01:59:54,880
The stock market is

2300
01:59:55,392 --> 01:59:56,928
Exactly look at how high it is right

2301
01:59:57,696 --> 01:59:59,488
The next it'll never stop

2302
01:59:59,744 --> 02:00:00,512
Going to end

2303
02:00:01,792 --> 02:00:03,584
Maybe I don't know it

2304
02:00:03,840 --> 02:00:05,376
Double bus to make a prediction of what

2305
02:00:05,888 --> 02:00:07,680
But when it does I will make

2306
02:00:07,936 --> 02:00:08,704
This prediction

2307
02:00:09,216 --> 02:00:10,496
Alex will blame the global

2308
02:00:10,752 --> 02:00:11,264
Yeah

2309
02:00:11,776 --> 02:00:13,312
And the GOP will blame the poor

2310
02:00:13,824 --> 02:00:14,592
And knowing

2311
02:00:14,848 --> 02:00:15,872
Alex Jones

2312
02:00:16,128 --> 02:00:16,640
Probably pretty

2313
02:00:16,896 --> 02:00:17,920
Clear at this point that

2314
02:00:19,712 --> 02:00:21,504
It will be very easy

2315
02:00:22,016 --> 02:00:22,528
Scapegoat

2316
02:00:24,320 --> 02:00:24,832
Blame

2317
02:00:25,344 --> 02:00:26,880
It'll probably actually go with me

2318
02:00:27,136 --> 02:00:27,904
Probably easier

2319
02:00:28,160 --> 02:00:29,184
Only good thing about

2320
02:00:29,696 --> 02:00:31,232
Is that during those dark

2321
02:00:33,280 --> 02:00:34,560
We will get to kill

2322
02:00:35,840 --> 02:00:38,656
That is going to happen

2323
02:00:39,168 --> 02:00:41,472
Sure there's going to be a fascist dictator that rise

2324
02:00:41,728 --> 02:00:42,752
Your Napoleon

2325
02:00:43,008 --> 02:00:43,776
You're Hitler

2326
02:00:44,032 --> 02:00:44,544
Whatever your

2327
02:00:46,336 --> 02:00:47,616
In those intervening time

2328
02:00:48,128 --> 02:00:48,896
We're going to get to Townsend

2329
02:00:49,408 --> 02:00:50,688
I will politely.

2330
02:00:50,944 --> 02:00:53,248
Decline of the actually murdering

2331
02:00:55,552 --> 02:00:56,320
And I agree with you

2332
02:00:58,880 --> 02:00:59,904
Believe me

2333
02:01:00,160 --> 02:01:00,928
When they do come

2334
02:01:01,696 --> 02:01:02,208
Come on over

2335
02:01:03,232 --> 02:01:04,512

And then

2345

Next episode go take calls from critical role

2346

And then I just

2347
02:01:54,432 --> 02:01:54,944
You know there's a

2348
02:01:55,200 --> 02:01:55,712
Just one guy

2349
02:01:56,224 --> 02:01:57,760
Oh I think is really at fault

2350
02:01:58,528 --> 02:01:59,040
For all of the

2351
02:02:04,672 --> 02:02:05,952
You tried to get him

2352
02:02:06,720 --> 02:02:07,232
Catch that buck

2353
02:02:07,488 --> 02:02:09,536
Bladen is Choppers

2354
02:02:10,560 --> 02:02:13,376
That's why we're going to start at the feet

2355
02:02:13,888 --> 02:02:17,728
He's got robot teeth ever made by CIA

And this guy

2364
02:02:27,456 --> 02:02:29,248
Ringleader behind all of this

2365
02:02:30,528 --> 02:02:31,040
I just have
