1
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:21,248
Dammit

2
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:27,648
I have great respect for knowledge but I'm sick of them posing as you're through the good guy

3
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:40,448
Need money

4
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,088
Stripe.com

5
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:09,632
Jones what's up

6
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:10,400
Have you ever had

7
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:13,216
Maybe

8
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:19,616
Maybe I don't know not to not to the point where it's ever been.

9
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:26,016
Or anything like that one time I got sun poisoning on a float trip

10
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:30,624
It's quicker

11
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,416
Version of sunburn

12
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:34,464
It's much worse

13
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:37,536
I will

14
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:42,400
I only because my friends when I said that I went to the doctor

15
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:46,752
Like nothing I've ever

16
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:53,920
My cousins all over my body

17
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:56,224
Through my skin at all times

18
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,760
To the point where I was almost crying

19
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:01,600
Cold bath

20
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,624
Yeah just alike

21
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,648
Not Victor

22
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:10,048
Fight back in the way that I felt made sense

23
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,144
And I would lay in bed on my stomach

24
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,704
Biting the corner of my macro have to fight

25
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,472
It was

26
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:19,776
Brutal truth

27
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:28,736
But I was just drunk by the time we started floating

28
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,856
I was like 20

29
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,136
Yeah

30
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:35,904
Yeah

31
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:43,840
It was if I recall correctly

32
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:44,608
Believe this

33
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,400
The same year that I got a mice

34
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:50,752
Temporary tattoo

35
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:56,384
Temporary tattoos

36
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,784
If I put it on my arm I put it on my arm

37
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:09,184
As we were floating down the river is my Big B that every time we passed somebody else

38
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:19,424
Starhub sun poisoning didn't start hurting until like

39
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,192
You know what I got back

40
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:22,496
It was one of the worst

41
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:24,800
I think I actually ended up

42
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:27,360
Having to drop out of a college class

43
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,640
Because

44
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,432
It was a summer school class

45
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:33,760
3 days

46
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:35,296
Because it's like really

47
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:37,344
Yeah summer school schedule

48
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,624
We're going and talking to the

49
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,160
The professor

50
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:46,560
But that's

51
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:49,888
The time that the sun has hurt me the most

52
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:52,448
Considered

53
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:57,056
Message

54
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:57,824

55
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,360

56
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,408
Don't be like me

57
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:04,736
It was a dumb kid

58
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,528
Stupid

59
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:12,928
About sun poisoning

60
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:23,423
We got really interesting in-depth episode

61
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,471
That we will touch on

62
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:30,847
And go over today but before we get to any of that I believe that

63
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,895
To spend a little time

64
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:33,919
People have signed up

65
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,967

66
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,503

Final-fantasy-vii is it okay

72
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:06,431
Yeah it's one of those things where I'm sure some of these names are references to things that I don't know what they are and I'm glad it's Final Fantasy

73
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:10,527
Because anyone could probably slip through

74
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,599
But I just assumed as a crazy name is

75
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:18,463
Well that's not the problem that's a member of the third right cool

76

00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:32,191
Prediction

92
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,983
At the end of this episode

93
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:35,775

For a large

100
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:53,951
He's only in studio on the 27th and 28th

101
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:54,975
Comes back on

102
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,511
Mike Adams

103
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:59,327
One of his dumb employees Aaron dykes

104
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,863
Fills in as a host

105
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,655
Like you just gets guest host

106
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,423
Tefillin

107
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,215
And honestly I believe

108
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:07,519
Even the surrounding time

109
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:09,055
He's on vacation in his head

110
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,847
Like on the 27th

111
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:11,615

00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:18,015
There's really not a whole lot to go over can we come back on the 10th there's nothing that I saw fit to pull as I

113
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:21,599
There's just nothing

114
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:24,415
He's checked out he knows that he needs to go on vacation

115
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:26,975
He knows he's going to be gone for a nice week

116
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:32,607

Is over guys

118
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:41,311
Really not much to go over

119
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:48,479
Go back to the ER to try and have a better understanding

120
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,015
Bird

121
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,807
In particular we're seeing

122
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:52,831
A lot of

123
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:57,439
Trends that are clearly related to the phenomenon that's happening in the

124
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,463
Conspiracy world around

125
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:00,511
The popularity of the

126
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,303
Conspiracy videos about it that

127
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,071
Truther

128
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,607
Kim Coates videos about it

129
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:06,911
The way Alex has started covering all of the

130
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:07,935
These shootings with

131
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:11,519
Rank suspicion

132
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,055
Glom into that market

133
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,431
Anything

134
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,711
Nothing

135
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,247
Stretch

136
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,271
Think about cuz

137
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:24,575
Sometimes when we're doing the 2013 episodes

138
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:25,343
I'm almost

139
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,903
Oh that's right we're talking about Sandy Hook

140
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:30,719
These are so often unrelated

141
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:31,743
It is interest

142
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,279
To think about what's bubbling

143
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,815
Around Alec

144
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,143
He may be talking about some

145
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,167
Random and weird

146
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:41,471
All the wild in the background on YouTube

147
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:43,263
New Sandy Hook

148
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,031
Truther

149
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:49,919
Pretty

150
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:54,015
Like it's it's bubbling up

151
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:56,063
And there is almost like

152
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,343
I would assume

153
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,159
On some level Within

154
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:03,999
The ranks have been thinking like why aren't we

155
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:06,047
Moron

156
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,583
And you know what the other thing that I'm

157
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,655
About the I think it's a failure of whatever we can

158
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,679
Can do as an investor

159
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:12,447
Navigation

160
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,239
Is it we're not covering

161
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,519
Infowars nightly

162
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:18,335
Okay Alex's cohorts

163
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,127
Are doing their report

164
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:24,223
Yeah people like robbed David Knight who work there at the time

165
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,759
I believe Jakari Jackson

166
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:26,783
Doing the Nightly News

167
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,087
Like they

168
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:32,415
Might be covering Sandy Hook s*** more

169
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:34,975
Right hasn't made it to Alex's

170
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:36,255
Is Varsity show

171
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:43,423
He don't come up and he does definitely think the globalists did it

172
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,519
Them it isn't

173
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,799
Steven slow-play

174
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,103
For sure

175
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:51,871
Just nothing going on

176
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,943
So are the only thing that I really feel

177
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:58,783
Like is worth talking about comes up on

178
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,343
Vacation

179
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,623
Alex

180
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,159
Terrible terrible mood

181
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,719
And it's because of a bill

182
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,767
He is caught window

183
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:35,647
So we got this bill do sexually to bills

184
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:41,023
Alex is responding to reporter Melissa

185
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:41,791
This morning

186
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:43,583
He's completely lost his mind

187
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,143
Sp6

188
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,167
3in sp6

189
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:50,239
Sp63 allowed some children

190
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:54,079
To consent to receiving vaccines without parental permission

191
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,871
He's doing some heavy lifting in that sense

192
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,407
According to Texas

193
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:00,991
Pre-existing family codes there are a ton of instances where a child

194
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,783
Consent to their own Healthcare decisions

195
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,319
Regardless of what their parents say

196
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:09,951
At least 1995 a child can make their own medical decisions

197
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:12,511
Horror if abuses espectador

198
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:13,279
If the child is sick

199
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,303
Treatment-related

200
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,071
The drug addiction

201
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,351
There plenty of events

202
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:19,679
This is where the state rightly realizes a demanding parental consent

203
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,215
A treatment would put a child's life

204
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,007
Level of concern

205
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:23,775
Is not required

206
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:27,871
B63

207
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:28,895
Symptoms of when a child

208
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:32,479
Consent to their own Healthcare with specific language

209
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,039
Did sp60

210
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:38,623
C3 was to make it explicit that a child can control their own vaccinations

211
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,415
Decisions

212
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:43,487
Or has a child of their own that's all of it

213
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,535
It's really crazy cuz

214
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,583
What's the coverage of this device freaking out

215
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,607
Dreaming about it

216
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:52,703
It's just rambling about other governments tried to kill every

217
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,751
Event for SPC

218
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,031
64 this is really the

219
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,055
Justin Amanda gov text

220
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,079
Human resource

221
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,383
Today the people who work at license

222
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,175
Childcare facility

223
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,711
Need to be immunized for vaccine

224
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,479
Preventable disease

225
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:06,783
Which

226
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:14,207
Yeah it would be infuriating as I last night at the was working

227
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:20,607
Somebody was a anti vaxxer

228
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,143
And I went

229
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:28,543
The crowd really never know

230
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:35,199
He was giving me some like

231
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,439
So anyways

232
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:47,487
I was just out about that about

233
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,279
Amending the codes like

234
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,839
How to save it till you know that's pretty.

235
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,119
Discriminatory

236
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:56,447
People just don't want to get vaccines or whatever Pepsi

237
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:58,495
Discriminating against people

238
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:01,055
Here's the problem this amendment sp60

239
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:03,615
Before explicitly says that they're probably will quote

240
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:08,479
Include procedures for facility employees to be exempt from required vaccine

241
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:12,063
He goes on to say that it'll formulate guidelines quote

242
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:14,111
For a facility employee who is exempt

243
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:14,879
Required back

244
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:17,183
Include procedures

245
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,719
The employer must follow to

246
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:19,487
To protect children

247
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:20,767
Under the facilities

248
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,047
Care from exposure

249
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:22,815
Such as

250
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:24,607
Protective

251
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,655
Medical equipment including gloves and mask

252
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:29,215
Based on the level of risk the employee presents.

253
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,495
Two children by the employees were

254
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:32,287
Those are the children

255
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,335
They have a paragraph about how they need

256
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:36,127
Prohibit discrimination

257
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,407
Or retaliatory Act

258
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:40,223
Employees exempt from the required

259
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:44,575
For something it's allegedly supposed to be about forcing everyone to get shots

260
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,855
Seems like sb-6

261
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:48,927
For is going out of its way to accommodate people

262
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:49,951
Who are exempt

263
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:51,231
I'm getting shot

264
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,047
I respect that

265
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,327
I do

266
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,375
Maybe don't go

267
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,655
That

268
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:07,359
Accommodating accommodating at all then you have to go really far because it had Row Place the guy

269
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:10,175
Guidelines in order to accommodate the people who are

270
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:13,759
But you need to either going into got to go a mile

271
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,319
Necessarily

272
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:19,135
Some of the people who would be exempt

273
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:24,767
From the vaccination requirements

274
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:25,791
Appropriate

275
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,327
And right to do that

276
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:33,727
But sb64 explicitly require

277
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,263
Are vaccines

278
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,031
Conscience

279
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,311
Including a religious belief

280
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:40,127
That bill is not forcing anyone to get shots

281
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:42,431
It's clearly about Harbor adduction and protecting the health

282
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:44,479
Children

283
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:47,039
Respect the political and religious beliefs

284
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:50,111
That lead people to argue that they don't

285
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:51,903
Need to get shot

286
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,695
African comedy

287
00:14:54,207 --> 00:15:00,351
Explicitly says Melissa Melton morning

288
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,375
28 to 20 30

289
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,911
And that's why he's in such

290
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,703
The f*****-up mood on this show and Trust

291
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,519
He is not great on there

292
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,823
Both of those bills were introduced

293
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:10,847
The Texas Senate

294
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:12,639
On November 12th 20

295
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:13,407
12

296
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:16,735
It's been a quarter of a year since those bills were introduced

297
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:19,295
And somehow is cracked

298
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,599
Had just now figured out about that

299
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:22,879
These people

300
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:25,439
Are the tip of the spear

301
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:27,487
Tip of the spear

302
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:30,047
They are the Vanguard in the fight

303
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:30,815
Bills from

304
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:31,583
6 months

305
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,375
Just to be

306
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:36,959
A clear about this and really illustrate my point

307
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:39,519
Here is Alex Jones

308
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:41,311
63 was introduced

309
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,079
This week

310
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,359
Did last week

311
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:47,967
Which indicates to me that he either is very comfortable making s*** up

312
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:53,343
But he doesn't know was introduced in November

313
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,367
It has to be one of

314
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:57,695
I was very calm

315
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:10,751
We've got the number 63 number 6

316
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:15,615
No I mean he's just a liar or an idiot

317
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:18,431
There's no two ways about it

318
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,991
I mean I'm going to give

319
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:26,367
I am going to go out of my way to give him the benefit of the doubt but maybe

320
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,135
And she just

321
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:33,535
Wanted to cover it up there's a possibility possibility

322
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,839
Accepting other people's made

323
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:39,423
They're all bad

324
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:44,287
I'm not going to shake me from that

325
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,103
Alex

326
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,383
In order to

327
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,455
Like know what's going on through this stretch of

328
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:55,295
February 27th to March 3rd

329
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,623
That's it

330
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:01,951
In terms of the stuff that I think deserves coverage in our show

331
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:03,231
Not a lot

332
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:08,607
So what is episodes

333
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:09,631
Co-host

334
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,423
Suffer not really worth

335
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,191
While

336
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:15,775
Alex is a giver

337
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:18,079
You know.

338
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,359
I often sign

339
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:21,407
Whenever they're really bad stretches

340
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,551
You'll find something

341
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:29,087
That merits discussion

342
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:34,463
There is one such thing that happens during February 27th 2013

343
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:36,511
Episode that sent me on

344
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,303
A very interesting Crusade

345
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,887
Oh really terrifying

346
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,167
Into

347
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:46,751
Potential things that Alex Jones believe

348
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:49,567
A contact

349
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:52,639
Do some of the things that we talked about for quite a while

350
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,223
So here is that

351
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:58,527
From February 27th

352
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:04,927
The Bible says

353
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:27,199
Always talks about

354
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,271
It's so big in his

355
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:33,855
He's he's constantly around the 26

356
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:34,623
15 election

357
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:39,999
He always talks about how they can't give us a reprieve

358
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:42,303
Right

359
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,839
It's so consist

360
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:44,863
He's always

361
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:51,263
Just buying time we heard on

362
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:53,823
Was the last episode of doing before it where he's talking about his dog

363
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,359
Where he

364
00:18:55,615 --> 00:19:01,759
Do you know how to write

365
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:02,783
12 quarts

366
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,343
I think he has probably

367
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:07,391
Weird ideas about what's worth

368
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:10,463
Artificially continuous

369
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:16,863
I've always found a really interesting when Alex gets specific why what sorts of religious

370
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:17,887
Figures he thinks pause

371
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:19,935
Yeah like

372
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:22,239
Really negatively about a lot of fun

373
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:23,263
But you hate

374
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:25,567
The glitterbug churches the

375
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,663
Consistently negative I like

376
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,455
The Prosperity Gospel.

377
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:33,503
In the mainstream Christianity

378
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,551
Enemies

379
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,319
Infiltrated

380
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:39,391
But I really never found the degenerate

381
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,975
To specifically about what sorts of religious

382
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:43,743
Influences

383
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:49,119
Things are good right has he ever told us like oh I go to this church

384
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:55,519
I think I'll be unsafe for the church for Edsel

385
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:57,567
No I don't I don't I don't

386
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:04,223
Inappropriate

387
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,759
It's weird for me to make an assumption

388
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:10,879
What about it but I would be fairly surprised

389
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:18,303
We know basically that he thinks demons Walk Among Us that he's in a literal battle with a literal death that the Rapture is happening

390
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,095
After the tribulation

391
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,375
Afterwards

392
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:27,263
Within that conveniently allows them to blend these ideas of religious piety and righteous trench warfare

393
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:31,103
That's great

394
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:35,455
This Clifton we just heard as part of an interview with a woman named Katherine Albrecht

395
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:40,831
It's supposed to be about the RFID chip put in everybody but it quickly

396
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:44,159
To have these RFID chips of the little rolled biblical mark of the beast

397
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:50,559
And from there it's just a hop skip and a jump for them turn the show into outright televangelism everybody's got to get right with God

398
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:52,863
Crazy

399
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:53,631
Christian

400
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:54,655
Tell me that

401
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:55,935
Be literal Market

402
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:00,031
Never heard that one

403
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:02,079
In the middle of this Alex

404
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:05,919
Katherine Express

405
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:07,967
And that they're just going to have to survive

406
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:12,063
This is going to be important to me sites

407
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:13,599
The figure to agree

408
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:14,623
With him

409
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:17,696
The wrestler interviews boring so I decided to check in

410
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,720
After what

411
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:19,488
What is referencing

412
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,536
Am I got told me you would leave me so

413
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:22,304
Somewhere weird

414
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:26,400
Smith

415
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:29,216
Skier figured people like you and me

416
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:30,240
And the world

417
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:31,264
Right

418
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:33,056
His name is

419
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:37,152
Ones that only a very specific sort of person would bring up in conversation

420
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:38,944
Particularly in a positive way

421
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,736
As someone whose opinion you should take

422
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:41,504
Seriously

423
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:46,112
In 1980 David Smith founded the Church of God Evangelistic

424
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:46,880
Association

425
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:49,696
Every broke away from the worldwide Church of God

426
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:53,536
The worldwide Church of God intern was founded by Herbert Armstrong

427
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:57,888
1931 under the name the radio Church of God

428
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:04,288
Pat's Church

429
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:08,640
Possibly

430
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:13,248
So Armstrong's career was characterized by doomsday predictions that routinely failed Summit

431
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:14,016
Serialized

432
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:18,112
You're a pretty good run and when it was all over his influence would be pretty substantial

433
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:20,416
Hawkwind on the way

434
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:24,512
Too late 1970s things were not going great for his church

435
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:29,632
Armstrong son was trying to start a splinter group and he's been excommunicated from the group

436
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:33,984
Armstrong's wife passed away she remarried a woman half a century younger than him

437
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:35,520
Accusations Amalfi's

438
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:37,568
A flying around him all over the place

439
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:38,848
So it only makes sense

440
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:40,896
Enterprising member of that group with

441
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:43,200
You did the right time to start their own thing

442
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:44,480
And that's exactly what David

443
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:49,856
Started his Church of God Evangelistic Association

444
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:50,880
Too far from

445
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:53,440
Some of the basic tenets of Armstrong theology

446
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:58,304
British Israel

447
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:00,352
Which mites

448
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:01,632
Strike you as a foreign

449
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:05,984
No no because

450
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,520
Of course I would

451
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:11,616
I would put together Israel in Britain those two things

452
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:18,016
So closely related to

453
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:19,296
Close to work

454
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:23,904
Sort of

455
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:28,512
The subject of British is realism as a really complicated thing and it means a bunch of different things in

456
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:29,536
For contacts

457
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:33,376
So it's important for me to be pretty clear about what we're talking about as we go through this

458
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,472
British is realism or Anglo is realism

459
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:39,520
Is the belief that white Anglo-Saxon

460
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:43,360
Comes primarily those of Western European Heritage are the direct descendants of

461
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:44,896
The ten lost tribes of Israel

462
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:49,760
I believe that now

463
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:54,624
Proponents of the theory point to Bible stories about Jacob later to be renamed Israel

464
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,696
Each of them gave birth to their own tribe

465
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:59,232
The Twelve Tribes

466
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,328
When Solomon died only to drive those of Judah

467
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,656
What accept the rule of Solomon's son rehoboam

468
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:12,544
Reborn was a crew leader and is thrown would result in what amounted to a civil war

469
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:17,152
These two tribes that sided with him became the southern Kingdom or the kingdom of Judah

470
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:19,968
And the ten other tribes were the northern kingdom or the king

471
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:20,736
Israel

472
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:27,392
In the 720's bze the Assyrians invaded and sent all those but the tribes in the

473
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:28,928
Southern Kingdom into exile

474
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,256
As The Story Goes the ten tribes became lost

475
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:37,120
However archaeology anthropology

476
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:38,912
Simplistic and clear-cut version

477
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:41,216
Of these tribes just getting lost history

478
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:43,008
Many members of the tribe

479
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:46,848
Flight back to the southern kingdom is reabsorbed into that population

480
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,200
Others were taken back to Assyria and midday of where they were assimilated into those called

481
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:55,040
It's not like it was a Walmart

482
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:58,112
Time

483
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:00,160
Yeah

484
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:04,512
Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon attacked the southern population was X

485
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:08,096
This population of the Southern Kingdom

486
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:11,424
Judah was by that point to constituted of the two tribes

487
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,960
You stayed loyal to

488
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:16,288
As well as many of the members of the northern kingdom blue slide South 100

489
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,312
40 years prior

490
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:26,016
By the time exiled Israelites return to Jerusalem to rebuild the kingdom their identity was largely unify

491
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,576
The people are real the struggle

492
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:30,880
The struggles are real the heritage is real

493
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:33,184
Tribes got lost

494
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,488
Is seen by most Scholars as more myth

495
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:40,608
The consensus opinion is that between the Assyrian invasion of the northern kingdom

496
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:42,656
And the Babylonian invasion of the Southern

497
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:47,264
Most of the members of these tribes have become integrated into the larger identity

498
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:51,360
Or into the places where they had ended up like

499
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:54,944
National History it makes sense to put that myth

500
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:55,968
Together because

501
00:25:56,224 --> 00:26:01,088
You almost immediately remove the identity of those

502
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,952
Quote lost tribes you know if you are in one of those lost tribes

503
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:07,744
You came back you're no longer

504
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,768
In that lost

505
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:09,536
Grab your in

506
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:13,120
So you create them at their lost as opposed to like

507
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:16,192
They came back or they got

508
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:18,496
Assyria

509
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:19,264
That kind of

510
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:21,056
In order to strengthen your own

511
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:24,128
Forward to more modern

512
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:27,712
For centuries legends about the Lost tribes

513
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:34,368
One of the often repeated myths said that the tribes were

514
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:40,512
Who flows for six days of the week and stops on Shabbat to travel

515
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:46,400
Explanations of bounded for wino and the tribes even though people were looking really hard for them

516
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:49,472
So hard so it's like that isn't that just like a really

517
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:50,240
Fun

518
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:56,640
Magical river that stops only on the time when they can't cross it

519
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:01,760
I like that that image

520
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:06,880
A book called The Ten lost tribes

521
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:09,440
The book gave the first voice to

522
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,720
The theory that the groups like The

523
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:11,744
The Celts the German

524
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,768
Scandinavia

525
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,048
They were in fact

526
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:16,096
The tribes of Israel that have gotten lost

527
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:22,240
While the theory didn't go Mega viral it did gain a little bit of traction early on and here's where one of the most important

528
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,264
Distinctions comes into

529
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,032
The play

530
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:27,872
In the 1600s this idea began to spread a little bit and Britain

531
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:30,176
It was not explicitly antista

532
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,552
The proponents of this Theory believe that the people who are Jewish were the descendants of the tribes

533
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:36,320
Judah

534
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:38,880
BlueStacks

535
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:41,184
So they were all Israel

536
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:44,000
It could definitely be described as co-opting

537
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:49,376
But at that point in history the ideas were not being spread to deny Jewish people their Heritage or to demonize

538
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:51,168
There are plenty of other problem

539
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:55,264
Which we'll get into later but antisemitism was not one

540
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,312
So it's just kind of one of those

541
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:02,176
Fitting together why we believe in our version

542
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:03,456
Christianity with

543
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:04,992
Why are we

544
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:05,760
Completely

545
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:07,040
Different people so you

546
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:07,808
You kind of sex

547
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:08,576
Well

548
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:10,112
Also

549
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:12,160
We're also Jews so that make more sense

550
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:17,280
Contacts it's probably a little piece of it fits that but much larger reason

551
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,304
Sandwich will get into light

552
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,352
I think it's a timing issue

553
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,936
These Notions small pockets for a long time

554
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:28,032
Finally reaching their peak in the 888

555
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:32,896
In the early 1900s these theories began to take hold in the United

556
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,688
That is the point worth it

557
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:35,456
Things got ugly

558
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:37,760
Here's the final caveat I will give on them

559
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:39,040
Therap

560
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:44,416
Still some churches that exist the believe in British Israel isn't that don't hate Jewish people

561
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:45,696
But they are

562
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:46,464
Exception

563
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,488
Not to the rule

564
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:53,120
If the 1920s in the United States British Israel beliefs were co-opted by outright bigots

565
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:53,888
Anti-semite

566
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,936
And ever since that point the ideas

567
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:57,216
Been almost there

568
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:58,240
Exclusive domain

569
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:01,312
The group Christian identity traces their roots

570
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:02,336
The British Israel

571
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:08,736
Is the belief that the white race is true identity is the Lost tribes of his

572
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:14,624
Christian identity is a Loosely organized theologically entwined overtly white supremacist

573
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,392
Terrorist party

574
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,696
It wouldn't be right to call them a group

575
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:18,976
Sunsaver penchant for

576
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:20,000
Decentralisation

577
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:24,352
And they follow the leaderless resistance model popularized by Louis

578
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:27,680
Wasn't it here until Christian identity

579
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:33,312
Christian identities fingerprints are all over the history of the people behind right-wing terrorism hate group

580
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:34,592
Since the 1950

581
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,640
Their paths intersect with

582
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:39,968
The clan area Nations the militia movement of the 90s

583
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:42,784
The American Nazi party and its founder George link

Rockwell

585
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:46,368
The key difference between British is realism in the

586
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:52,768
The 1600s in Britain and the 19th American is the whereas the prior believe the Jews were

587
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:55,840
Also descendants of Israel the ladder did not

588
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:59,936

The Narrative change

591
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:03,520
No longer was the

592
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:06,336
The theory just that white people were also Israelites

593
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:09,408
It was now that they were the only true Israelites

594
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,480
And the vast majority of the people who think they're Jewish

595
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:13,504
Are imposters

596
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:15,296
Okay well

597
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:16,064
Stop that

Underpants Underpants

602
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:26,048
Ton of these right-wing

603
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:26,816
Yeah

604
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:32,192
How many people or what

605
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:33,472
People are

606
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:44,480
He traced a lot of the time

607
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:46,528
Is really murky and really hard about the

608
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:48,064
This world it's amazing to me

609
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,368
How far the people go to

610
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:52,160
To justify their bigotry

611
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:55,744
Like it all starts from you think white people are the

612
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,280
And then you have to

613
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:58,048
To create the

614
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,840
Fantastical

615
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:00,864
Situations where you like

616
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,424
No it's okay I think

617
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,192
People are the best

618
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:06,240
I think a lot of it can be traced

619
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:09,568
To the idea of wanting to retain

620
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:11,360
Self image of being

621
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:14,432
Christian Christian

622
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:22,112
Simultaneously

623
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:23,904
A large part

624
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,464
People who buy also

625
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,232
Is match

626
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:29,024
Easier

627
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,328
Maybe giving up whatever

628
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:33,888
Security you feel in your Supremacy

629
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:34,912
I don't know

630
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:35,936
Anyway

631
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:38,240
Some Christian identity folk swing for the fence

632
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:41,056
Doesn't argue that Jews are literally descended from the Devil

633
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:44,896
What the word Mainline position is it

634
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:45,920
Cossacks

635
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:48,224
Curiosity

636
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,248
Pure bloodline

637
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:56,416
Sisters were actually a population of Turkey

638
00:31:56,672 --> 00:32:01,536
Who converted to Judaism as part of an elaborate plan aimed at taking out the true Israel

639
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:04,352
I can already hear you asking Jordan

640
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:06,144
What are these Turkish people

641
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:08,704
What is it that they want

642
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,728
I was going to ask that

643
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:12,288
Dance

644
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,824
Podcast over

645
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:16,384
Dancer goes back to Genesis 25

646
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,176
And the story of Jacob and Esau

647
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:20,736
Esau was Isaac's first born son

648
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:23,808
She was entitled to a larger share of the inheritance

649
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:25,344
And all the races lineage

650
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,880
The come along with being recognized

651
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:27,904
First born

652
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:30,208
The name for this in the Bible is

653
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:30,976
Birthright

654
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,840
Genesis 25 tells the story of Esau

655
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:37,632
Jacob for some stew

656
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:41,216
Jacob offers him food if Esau will give him his Birthright

657
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:42,496
Esau degrees

658
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:44,544
And a Birthright is transferred to Jacob

659
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:46,848
Esau later married women that Isaac

660
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:48,384
Forbade him to marry and then Jake

661
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,432
Still have to pretend to be Esau and Order

662
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,712
Bestowed with Isaac

663
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:56,576
6 Birthright blessing but the point is that you thought was the firstborn and ultimately the birthright went

664
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:58,368
To Jacob and this pissed off

665
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:11,680
Hairy arm so he lost his Birthright that's

666
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:15,520
Sure how common

667
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:23,968
That the version of British has realism the David Jason preaches specifically believe

668
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,576
Dipso because they are

669
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:29,856
Descendants of Esau

670
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:35,744
And even carrying out a centuries-long Khan to reclaim the birthright that was handed down from Jacob to the

671
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,792
Anglo-Saxon

672
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:39,072
Work to believe that

673
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:40,608
That's exhausting

674
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:44,448
Oh yeah makes sense

675
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:46,496
Spend so much time like

676
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:48,544
Diagramming the reason

677
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:51,616
Like maybe it's just me

678
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:52,384
Maybe it's just

679
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,408
True and everybody cool

680
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:54,944
Try that one

681
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:57,504
Pastor David

682
00:33:58,016 --> 00:34:00,064
Would refuse the label of Christian ident

683
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:04,928
And from all the sermons I listen to I get a strong sense that he doesn't think he's a white supremacist

684
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,000
I don't disrespectfully disagree with that assessment

685
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:14,144
Alvarez out right away supremacist an anti-semite is I've ever come across doing this back

686
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:18,240
It was important to walk through some of that differentiation

687
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:24,384
In between British is realism

688
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:32,832
He is far closer to being a Christian identity preacher then he is to be in 1B pro-jewish eccentric

689
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:35,392
Espousing British Israel ideas back in the

690
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:37,696
So

691
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:40,256
History of these ID

692
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:48,960
Put simply Herbert Armstrong was realism in America

693
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:51,520
Long after the point it was very discredited

694
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:56,640
Long after the idea taking hold is a large piece of white supremacist rhetoric of the United States

695
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:59,968
Herbert Armstrong whose worldwide Church of God

696
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:04,576
Which is

697
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:07,904
In 1920s

698
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,744
Is when the Christian identity movement started the coop

699
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:13,280
Covid-19

700
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:15,328
Is all after these

701
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:17,376
Associated with

702
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,448
Behavior

703
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:24,288
It's probably because I remember specifically

704
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:30,688
20

705
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:31,456
Amount of anti

706
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:32,736
Images of that word

707
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:34,528
Public Disco

708
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,624
Articles in the New York Times being like

709
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,208
Like to be allowed to live in America and all this stuff

710
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:43,744
And that was one of the

711
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:46,048
When Hitler

712
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:47,584
Look like

713
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,352
When Germany was

714
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:49,632
Exterminating

715
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:50,400
The Jews

716
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:52,960
He kind of thought that we would be on board

717
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:59,360
Large section of population

718
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:00,896
We were

719
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:03,200
Hair's breadth away from being

720
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:05,248
Could have easily not decorate

721
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:11,392
He is when he started

722
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,976
Good time this was a belief he decided to hold onto

723
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:18,560
So you might be able to tell a few things about him from that

724
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:19,840
Or at least

725
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:21,120
Get some

726
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,240
David Lee Smith did differentiate himself from Armstrong

727
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:27,008
Church a little bit

728
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:29,568
Owatonna preaching about

729
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:32,896
Particularly about the dangers of communism

730
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:34,688
The creation of a one-world government

731
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:40,064
His sermon titles from the mid-1980s through the mid-1990s read like Alexa

732
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,088
Texarkana Valex Jones

733
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:46,720
From November 24th 1984 why the coming cashless

734
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:50,048
Society

735
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:54,656
From February 8th 1991 history of the Illuminati and New World Order

736
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:56,960
So that's

737
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,568
It might be my pastor was like

738
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:07,968
Just going to talk a little bit about the Illuminati okay we're going to go through Daniel 11 as listen to h h

739
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:10,272
Sermons

740
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:13,856
Interesting now like I always listen

741
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:14,880
So much

742
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:16,160
David Jason

743
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:17,696
And

744
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:19,744
It's it really was like being back in

745
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:21,280
Because you could

746
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:22,816
I kept thinking like

747
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:26,144
Wrap it up

748
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,752
I kept sitting here in my chair like

749
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:32,288
Can almost

750
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,384
Get up he's on he's got to be

751
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,944
He's very weird you later head down on the

752
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:45,344
Back of the Pew in front of you and I just took a little nap and you got that red spot on your head I really wanted to find a program

753
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:50,464
Close to John. Bullet points

754
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,000
So some other

755
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:56,864
Discernment

756
00:37:57,888 --> 00:38:03,520
Spoiler alert post-trib

757
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:07,360
For 1992

758
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:09,664
Bilderberg connection that's a sermon

759
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:14,016
Two L's in Bilderberg

760
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:15,296
It's really hit the

761
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:16,576
The Bill Clinton

762
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:17,600
Bill

763
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:23,232
I don't think so

764
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:24,000
Of course

765
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:29,120
He didn't nine-part series called quote dismantling America for world

766
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:33,216
These are sermon 9 part 9 Park

767
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:37,312
Going to church for over 2 months

768
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:41,664
And he's just like now here is

769
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,224
That's what I haven't heard of serialized

770
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,040
Church before

771
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:49,088
He doesn't a lot there's like a side part

772
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:51,392
There's another five part one that I left

773
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:52,160
Listen to that

774
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:54,976
So bored

775
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:58,304
Episode Ford 500 like this isn't really good but listen

776
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:04,192
If you sticker it's like the wire at work

777
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:05,472
Other tires

778
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,568
He rails on the same bad guys is Alex

779
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,360
The Council on Foreign Relations

780
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:13,408
The trilateral commission the Bilderberg

781
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,736
Use of the same sources as Alex does like none dare call it

782
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:18,528
Conspiracy W Cleon skousen

783
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,832
He even seems to admire a lot of the same

784
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:23,392
There's so much and Alex Jones here

785
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:24,928
And a lot of this work

786
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:27,488
Long predates Alex ever getting on air

787
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,584
A ton of David Ray Smith sermons that I listen to were recorded by Alex

788
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:36,704
To the pretty young guy like Alex was 6 years old then they would submit started his church

789
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:38,496
Radio minutes

790
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:43,104
I can't say with any certainty that a ton of Alex's ideas Comfort David

791
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:46,944
But there's enough interesting parallel that really makes you start to wonder

792
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:50,784
Princeton Smith operating out of Waxahatchee

793
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,064
She texted early night

794
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:52,832
1880s

795
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:55,648
I was born in 1974

796
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:57,184
And in the early 80s

797
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,720
Who lived in Dallas Texas

798
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:01,024
A city less than 30 miles north of Wax

799
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:05,888
Waxahatchee in fact is right in between the city of Dallas and Freestone County

800
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:08,448
Where else is Dad owned a fair share of mineral

801
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:14,080
Justice Armstrong's Ministry began as a radio televangelism operation that was part of David

802
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:15,104
Woodsmiths work to

803
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,664
Is here and a radio show called Newswatch magazine

804
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:20,224
Who's shortwave signal almost definitely

805
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:22,016
Reached Dallas

806
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:22,784
Freestone County

807
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:23,808
I like to take that step

808
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:29,184
The shortwave is designed to go long distance

809
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,280
30 miles is nothing for a sore throat

810
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:34,304
So just like

811
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,328
My

812
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:37,888
Like on a long road trip my dad would put

813
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:38,656
A Prairie Home

814
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:39,424
Companion

815
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:40,960
On the radio

816
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:42,752
Entirely possible that Alex

817
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:44,288
In the car

818
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:45,824
His dad just puts on

819
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:47,104
Or at the home

820
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,128
Or as a home

821
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:50,432
Spock that's pretty wild

822
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:56,064
Couldn't shake the feeling there was something really big

823
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,600
You hear that Alex likes live

824
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,416
David Chase

825
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:10,144
Really really hurt Alex talk much about

826
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:11,936
Start to look at in the

827
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:13,472
So many similarities

828
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:16,032
Is a geographical connection

829
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:17,056
Couple of

830
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:18,336
Specific pieces of rhetoric

831
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:20,896
Add up to

832
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:23,200
Is British Israel is

833
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:24,992
Sup roof

834
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:27,296
I'm referencing Smith Beto Texas

835
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:34,208
Alternative explanation

836
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:39,840
I needed to know more so I sat down like I said I listen to

837
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:40,864
Hun's

838
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:41,888
David Jason

839
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:42,656
Radio Star

840
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:45,984
I lost count of how many hours of his rambling as listen to

841
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,264
But for what

842
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,568
I find it very difficult to imagine that Alex

843
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:50,848
The show

844
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:54,687
There's just far too many things that overlap little details

845
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:56,223
Insanely suspicious

846
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:58,783
So what I've done here is I've

847
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:01,855
Compiled from my God knows how many hours of listen

848
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:02,623
This dumbass

849
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:04,927
A bunch of clips

850
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:07,743
That I think are going to walk us through

851
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:08,767
Experience

852
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:10,303
So we can see if this

853
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:13,119
Is convincing to you or to the listener

854
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:15,679
So you're about

855
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:16,447
Disapprove

856
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:18,239
That

857
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:24,895
White people are descended from the Lost tribes of Israel

858
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:31,295
Is realism is actually correct

859
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:35,391
You are dumb what I am going to hopefully diamonds

860
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:40,511
Is first of all the David J Smith is a Proto Alex Jones

861
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:42,815
But he was a show before out

862
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:45,119
Event secondarily

863
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:47,167
I would like to give people a glimpse

864
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:49,215
Into what sort of show

865
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:51,263
Alex was listening to

866
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:52,543
You listen to David

867
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:54,591
Because

868
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:55,359
It's not

869
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:56,127
Just

870
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:57,407
New World Order

871
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:58,175
Conspiracy

872
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:03,295
There is there are other things being discussed on the show that I think

873
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:05,087
Would be

874
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:08,671
Really weird to imagine

875
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:10,719
That Alex thinks is okay

876
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:13,535
The first thing I'd like to demonstrate these clips

877
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:16,863
He's the sort of British a surrealism preacher

878
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,399
Who believes that most Jews

879
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:19,167
Aren't Jews

880
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:20,703
Is a huge problem

881
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:24,031
Since that this distinction put it much closer to the

882
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:25,823
Christian identity

883
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:32,223
Then just be British Israel ISM side of the road and I believe it's important because

884
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:38,623
And I don't want people to think that is undeserved so here is he saying

885
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:45,791
2% of all people on the face of the Earth who claimed to be Jews

886
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:47,839
Blood related Jews

887
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:49,375
Convert

888
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:51,167
Proselytes to Judaism

889
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:53,215
So 2%

890
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:53,983
Of the Jews

891
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:55,007
In the world

892
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:58,079
Take a survey or

893
00:43:58,335 --> 00:43:59,871
Was there a

894
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:04,991
How did it get to 92%

895
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:12,415
I'm just amazed whenever people make those wild claims and made

896
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:13,695
I just picked that number 9

897
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:15,231
Percent

898
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:15,999
Nothing but

899
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:18,303
He does have something behind it

900
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:21,119
I mean something

901
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:28,799
So David Smith they're actually

902
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:30,591
As I mentioned

903
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:35,711
DC Villains in the story of world history

904
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:40,063
In this next clip Smith explains how Eastern European Jews

905
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:42,111
Greenfield's are descendants of Esau

906
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:46,207
All responsible for many of the things in the world

907
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:48,511
Including International

908
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:51,327
They were very few in number

909
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:53,119
These were the racially

910
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:55,167
Pure juice who won across and

911
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:56,191
Converted other people

912
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:59,007
And then they begin to break down the bloodline

913
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:01,055
But there is other

914
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:02,079
Jews who

915
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:03,871
Historically

916
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:06,175
The trace back

917
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:07,455
Can sleep where they came from

918
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:11,295
Then we're not going to understand Bible prophecy

919
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:13,855
So I think it's vital that we do

920
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:15,903
Then when you start studying the orange

921
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:18,207
European Jews

922
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:20,255
This becomes very

923
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:22,815
Who was it that overthrew

924
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:23,583
Thesaurus

925
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:24,351
In Russia

926
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:26,143
Oh God

927
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:27,167
European juice

928
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:30,239
International communism

929
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:32,543
Eastern European Jews

930
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:38,943
Who is a trying to Stamp Out the United States the British Commonwealth all over the world and do away with Christianity

931
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:41,503
Eastern European

932
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:47,647
Excuse me sir

933
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:49,951
Do you have any evidence that this is true

934
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:53,535
I will tell you that he does reference that he's on edge

935
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:57,631
Because you know

936
00:45:57,887 --> 00:45:58,655
God tells you to

937
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:00,447
Understand everything with your scent

938
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:01,471
That's right

939
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:02,239
To be able to

940
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:04,031
Spiritually get this.

941
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:08,383
It's also a really dangerous standard of

942
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:10,175
Proof to two-and-a-half

943
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:15,295
Is that might be real

944
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:16,319
He can't even say the word

945
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:18,623
. without giving you the heart

946
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:20,671
Like anytime he says

947
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:24,767
You're already getting

948
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:32,447
This dude is f***** up

949
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:38,335
And in case you need it spelled out a little more explicitly he was David Jay Smith explained

950
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:40,383
Who's particularly

951
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:41,919
Are the descendants of

952
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:46,015
He speaks of the House of Esau Esau's descendants

953
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:49,343
He specifically means people who are alive today who aren't

954
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:56,767
It is now Esau and his descent coming up claiming to be God's chosen people when they are

955
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:57,535
I'm not

956
00:46:58,303 --> 00:47:00,863
And now we want to go into some scriptures and find out

957
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:02,911
Whether this is true or not

958
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:08,543
About the Jews of Eastern Europe are the ones who are behind the push for world government

959
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:10,335
So all of this stuff

960
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:12,127
Is anti world government

961
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:13,919
We're working against

962
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:18,527
The new world order that believes being formed by International communism

963
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:20,063
Push bike

964
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:22,367
This is a very clear

965
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:23,647
It's very

966
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:24,415
Ez2c

967
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:26,975
See-through what's going on here

968
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:27,743
He believed the

969
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:30,047
The Jews are trying to take over the world

970
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:31,071
Now

971
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:37,215
How they believe God works

972
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:40,031
Fairy Godmother you know like

973
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:42,079
Oh well because

974
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:43,359
One time

975
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:45,151
One guy tricks

976
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:46,175
Dab

977
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:50,271
Clearly all of these people forever are

978
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:56,671
There's a weirder version of that coming up in one of these clips

979
00:47:56,927 --> 00:48:03,071
Intersex

980
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:04,351
Bro

981
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:09,983
Is Eastern European

982
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:11,263
Imposter

983
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:12,287
Jewish Folk

984
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:16,383
They're creating International communism

985
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:17,151
And socialism

986
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:21,503
With the explicit goal of taking back Esau's Birthright that was given to Jacob

987
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:24,831
Carried on by the United States

988
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:27,391
Inexperienced arresting to me

989
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:29,183
This is just a sideline

990
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:31,999
And 17 to talks about Abby

991
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:33,535
It's going to rise up out of the sea

992
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:35,839
And it's called a Scarlet colored Beast

993
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:37,887
Red

994
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:39,167
And Woodward

995
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:40,959
The global

996
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:41,727
Network

997
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:45,311
Today that is enveloping the world already taken all of Asia

998
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:47,871
Most of Africa do not status

999
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:55,039
And yet this red

1000
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:58,367
Beast of Revelation 17 is now riding

1001
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:00,159
And it's going to conquer

1002
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:02,207
And it's going to end up being a world government

1003
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:03,487
And it's going to be

1004
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:09,119
Esau trying to regain his Birthright

1005
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:15,775
What's going on that's exactly what's going on

1006
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:19,615
Conception

1007
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:21,151
That he is just created the

1008
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:28,063
Making a battlefield between Anglo-Saxon people

1009
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:31,135
Andrews

1010
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:32,415
Convert

1011
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:34,207
The Neo-Nazi world

1012
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:38,303
Between Jews and non-jews

1013
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:39,327
What if they're just

1014
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:40,607
And we were all

1015
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:43,935
I like that I'm going to go with that way

1016
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:45,727
But it's not just that the Jews

1017
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:50,591
Descendants from Esau

1018
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:51,871
Also

1019
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:53,151
According to Smith

1020
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:58,015
They literally

1021
00:49:58,527 --> 00:49:59,295
Q

1022
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:01,599
And the Kabbalah how to have demons

1023
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:03,135
How to raise up spirit

1024
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:05,439
Necromancer

1025
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:09,023
How much clearer

1026
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:13,631
But they claim to be Jews

1027
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:14,911
God's chosen people

1028
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:16,191
When they're not

1029
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:17,215
They're not

1030
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:21,823
Scuse me password is doing a lot of raising your hands

1031
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:27,711
So could you point to the talmud where it teaches you how to raise the Dead

1032
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:32,831
It's like the Anarchist Cookbook

1033
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:38,975
No you can't parcel of his

1034
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:40,511
Explanation

1035
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:42,047
Infer why the Jews are

1036
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:43,327
To blame for their own

1037
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:46,143
Exile from places in

1038
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:51,519
Be alright

1039
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:53,311
The Mummy come out

1040
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:57,919
Is Brendan Fraser daddy level of Vic

1041
00:50:58,175 --> 00:50:58,687
Employment

1042
00:50:58,943 --> 00:50:59,455
Crazy

1043
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:00,991
Who's a very blunt

1044
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:02,783
Denial of Jewish identity

1045
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:04,319
That's happening

1046
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:05,087
Throughout

1047
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:06,111
Smith's Irma

1048
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:11,487
And it's very hard to imagine that a person could listen to him for any stretch of time and not get these messages

1049
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:12,255
Just loud and clear

1050
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:15,327
White people are the real Israelites and God's chosen

1051
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:16,863
And the Jews

1052
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:21,215
Create a world government system in order to deprive white people of their rightful place in the world

1053
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:23,775
And their Birthright and also Jews do Necro

1054
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:25,055
That just doesn't make

1055
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:28,639
It doesn't

1056
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:35,039
It does not make sense

1057
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:38,879
Know that they aren't really as realize they're aware of it

1058
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:41,183
Remember I'm using nothing

1059
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:42,207
Jewish

1060
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:43,743
Literature Excel

1061
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:44,767
The show

1062
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:45,535
They know the

1063
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:46,559
The truth of this matter

1064
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:48,095
So

1065
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:54,495
Excuse me pastor

1066
00:51:56,287 --> 00:51:59,359
Because the reference of Jewish encyclopedia Alaska

1067
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:02,175
Just like that

1068
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:05,247
Not only do you have an enemy on the world stage

1069
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:07,295
Explicit Battlefield

1070
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:08,319
Two forces

1071
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:09,599
You have an enemy that

1072
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:11,647
Keenly aware of their evil in

1073
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:16,767
You remove the possibility that maybe Smith as the first person to discover all this stuff

1074
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:19,583
The Jewish people don't know what they're up to what's going on

1075
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:23,167
No they know what they're doing and they know that it's Eva

1076
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:25,983
That sort of thinking can only lead to one can

1077
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:27,519
Conclusion and you do what

1078
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:30,847
David Smith doesn't shy away from that natural conclusion

1079
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:33,663
Obadiah 18 through 21

1080
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:36,223
House of Jacob shall be a fire

1081
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:37,759
And the house of Joseph

1082
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:40,575
Let's the twin Sons Ephraim and Manasseh

1083
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:42,111
A flame

1084
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:43,391
Another words Ally

1085
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:46,975
And the house of Esau for stubble

1086
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:49,023
Burns up in fire

1087
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:52,351
And I still Kindle in them and devour them

1088
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:56,191
And there shall not be any remaining of a house of

1089
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:56,959
Esau

1090
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:00,799
Zoe songs going to be destroyed because they

1091
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:01,823
The god of Israel

1092
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:04,639
And they're trying to take back to Burke right

1093
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:07,455
So

1094
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:09,759
Like if you understand that clip

1095
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:12,831
He's saying that the extermination of Jews will happen

1096
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:15,391
And it's a necessary part of reaching his religion

1097
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:17,183
The fair

1098
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:21,791
Keep in mind these are old recordings but not pre-World War

1099
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:25,375
It's very queer that would David Smith his preaching on the idea that

1100
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:30,751
Alex would look at this guy as anything other than a kind of bland milquetoast

1101
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:32,287
But

1102
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:34,335
Ratably scary

1103
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:36,383
Because he's talking about it

1104
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:37,151
Exterminator

1105
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:41,759
Yeah he said we're back we're back denying the Holocaust

1106
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:42,527
She saying it didn't

1107
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:43,295
Finish the job

1108
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:46,879
Write it believe it enough New World Order ideas

1109
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:49,951
There is still some of that like

1110
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:56,351
The New World Order orchestrated things

1111
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:59,423
In the funeral Obadiah tells us that

1112
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:01,471
Ephraim and Manasseh

1113
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:06,079
That's what he believes to be the United States and Britain

1114
00:54:06,335 --> 00:54:07,103
With which

1115
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:11,711
The sons of Esau are burnt up and young she'll survive

1116
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:14,783
What the f*** else are you what are you talkin about other than

1117
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:22,975
United States

1118
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:24,767
Absolutely

1119
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:26,303
There's no way around it

1120
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:28,863
Holy f******

1121
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:36,287
How is

1122
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:37,567
He's not bored.

1123
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:38,591
Somebody who

1124
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:40,383
Don't have a platform

1125
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:44,991
Judy Blume

1126
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:52,159
I want to get back to exactly what this Birthright is that Smithfield's is under attack by the

1127
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:53,695
Jewish people who are secretly

1128
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:55,999
The descendants of Esau who want their Birthright

1129
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:58,559
It's not some kind of fruitfulness

1130
00:54:58,815 --> 00:55:00,351
Sir Prosperity or Nationals

1131
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:01,887
That's like you might hope it is

1132
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:04,703
It's explicitly world domination

1133
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:07,519
According to Smith's interpretation of

1134
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:09,567
Scripture God is birthright to wipe

1135
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:11,615
People which gave them all manner of blessing

1136
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:18,783
They're entitled to enslave non-white people they're entitled to all the natural resources of the earth even in countries where

1137
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:19,807
The art they're wrong

1138
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:21,087
They have the run of the show

1139
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:23,903
Earlier I mentioned that even back in

1140
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:25,183
The 1600s in Britain

1141
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:27,487
These British Israelite beliefs didn't come

1142
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:28,511
From a good place

1143
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:31,327
And even if they weren't motivated by anti-semitism

1144
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:33,119
Here's where this

1145
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:33,887
Circumcised

1146
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:36,959
Frisch's realism and it's early formation

1147
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:43,359
Is largely seen as a way that ostensibly Christian people could rationalize the booming. Of British Colonial

1148
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:45,151
In the late

1149
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:46,943
1500 into the early 6

1150
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:47,711
C100

1151
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:51,295
The. That's known as the first

1152
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:52,319
British Empire

1153
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:55,903
Shake shake his Britain prioritize colonizing

1154
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:58,207
How much of the world is possible

1155
00:55:58,463 --> 00:56:00,511
The fighting with other European countries like Spain

1156
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:02,559
Over areas that it already

1157
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:04,095
In December

1158
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:04,863
1500

1159
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:08,447
East India company was founded which would go on to be a massive Force

1160
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:10,239
Colonialism through many corners

1161
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:15,103
About the history

1162
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:17,663
Nobody

1163
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:20,223
Nobody just committed genocide quite like

1164
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:25,087
What the British in many other countries was immoral on its

1165
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:27,903
They're going into territory that was inhabited

1166
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:31,487
Claiming it as their own off and enslaving or killing the native population

1167
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:33,535
Get on board with the program

1168
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:37,887
But simultaneously the country of the people were trying to retain the moral High Ground

1169
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:39,423
Do what they were doing wasn't

1170
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:40,447
Horribly evil

1171
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:42,239
Because according to what they profess

1172
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:46,079
Believe

1173
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:47,103
Was Orbitz

1174
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:53,503
These ideas are interesting at first but I think the reason they fell out of favor and never really caught on is too full

1175
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:56,319
Wonder completely debunked by Scholars from

1176
00:56:56,575 --> 00:56:57,087
Owatonna fields

1177
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:00,159
Second the purpose that these British has realism

1178
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:01,439
Ideas

1179
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:05,279
Easily by pills to ideas of British exceptionalism or

1180
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:07,839
Pretending that you're calling eyes in a country in order to bring Jesus

1181
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:09,119
Cortical Savages

1182
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:12,191
You don't need to rewrite all of history in order to get into

1183
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:13,215
Excuse for your behavior

1184
00:57:13,727 --> 00:57:14,495
So icy

1185
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:16,799
Suspect that most people saw British imperialism

1186
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:17,823
Overcomplicate

1187
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:24,479
Yeah justify brutal

1188
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:25,247
Nationalism

1189
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:26,015
Then

1190
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:28,831
The steps you need to take in order to rationalize

1191
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:30,623
Pretty sure

1192
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:32,415
This is the birthright

1193
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:33,951
The David Jay Smith preachers of

1194
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:36,511
The birthright that white people have

1195
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:37,791
To dominate the world

1196
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:39,583
In this sermon he

1197
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:42,655
Expressly points out former colonies

1198
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:45,471
Lesbian counter to his version of biblical prophecy

1199
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:47,007
And sauce is proof

1200
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:49,311
That the sons of Esau or on the March

1201
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:52,383
Just as fast as we Rose The Promise

1202
00:57:54,175 --> 00:57:56,735
Every one of these are being stripped

1203
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:02,623
Switch control

1204
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:06,463
Control all of Palestine and Egypt

1205
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:08,255
All of those are not free countries

1206
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:10,815
The Red Sea no longer belongs to Great Britain

1207
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:13,375
The Panama Canal has been given away

1208
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:15,167
From the United States

1209
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:16,959
Control by us anymore

1210
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:20,031
One by one every single one

1211
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:23,103
Which fulfilled prophecies are being strip

1212
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:25,663
From the United States and Great Britain today

1213
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:27,199
Every one of them

1214
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:28,479
So

1215
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:29,503
This dude's f******

1216
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:35,903
Easy the mask

1217
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:37,183
Who's preaching yeah

1218
00:58:37,695 --> 00:58:43,839
Another servant expands on his feelings about Rhodesia and South Africa

1219
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:44,607
Those countries

1220
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:50,751
The Rhodesia become Zimbabwe already still very much under apartheid rule

1221
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:53,055
He's all about it

1222
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:54,591
His profound

1223
00:58:54,847 --> 00:59:00,223
Especially considering the prison in the background

1224
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:02,015
Given these considerations

1225
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:06,623
We know that it's white people's Birthright to rule over the world and colonize whatever they want

1226
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:07,647
Take whatever resources they

1227
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:08,927
But what do you think

1228
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:10,463
Black people's Birthright is

1229
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:14,815
Oh no no I don't want to hear

1230
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:18,655
They get to be slaves literally forever you guessed correctly

1231
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:20,959
Notice numbers 24

1232
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:22,751
And Noah Walton

1233
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:25,055
Came out of his drunken stupor

1234
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:28,127
And knew what his younger son

1235
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:29,151
Now this wasn't

1236
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:32,223
The actual Sun

1237
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:34,015
Had done unto him

1238
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:36,831
Kenny said person be Canaan

1239
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:38,367
This is the son of ham

1240
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:42,463
Something to Noah Wyle was in a drunken stupor

1241
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:44,767
Literally sent the course of history

1242
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:46,559
And notice what happened

1243
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:48,351
A servant of servants

1244
00:59:48,863 --> 00:59:49,887
Shelly be under his breath

1245
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:53,471
What we would call basically

1246
00:59:53,983 --> 00:59:54,751
The African

1247
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:57,055
People that settle

1248
00:59:58,079 --> 00:59:58,591
Ham

1249
01:00:02,431 --> 01:00:04,223
All the way through the rest of History

1250
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:06,783
All through history forever

1251
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:13,183
Okay okay okay okay so somebody got into a f****** bar fight so black people are slaves for forever

1252
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:16,511
Bar fight it could have been a prank

1253
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:20,863
I don't know all the ins and outs of that story because I just don't care

1254
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:21,631
Cheese's

1255
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:28,031
Yeah yeah some happened to Noah when he was drunk and now black people are slaves forever

1256
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:36,735
And then like there was a Dogpile people like putting their hands over his mouth saying never

1257
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:38,527
Give him money

1258
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:40,831
Oh man white supremacist

1259
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:47,999
You keeping score

1260
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:52,863
Really dude that white people should rule the world in the black people are permanent slaves because someone Frank

1261
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:54,399
Text Noah Wyle was drunk one time

1262
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:56,447
I think I've already said this

1263
01:00:56,703 --> 01:00:59,263
Episode but it Bears repeating David Smith

1264
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:00,543
Complete white supremacist

1265
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:01,823
Ended insane

1266
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:05,151
Now we've established some of these really dangerous

1267
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:06,175
F*****-up ideas

1268
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:09,247
David Smith

1269
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:10,271
He was listening to

1270
01:01:10,527 --> 01:01:11,551
Stuff like this

1271
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:12,319
What are you

1272
01:01:12,575 --> 01:01:14,879
The kit yeah if he was

1273
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:17,951
Important that we need to take a little time highlight somebody glaring

1274
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:18,719
Similarities

1275
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:19,487
City has

1276
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:20,511
Alex Jones

1277
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:22,303
41

1278
01:01:22,815 --> 01:01:25,119
And he believes an international socialism

1279
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:25,887
Pretend

1280
01:01:26,143 --> 01:01:27,935
To be atheistic but is secretly

1281
01:01:28,959 --> 01:01:29,471
Bring the devil

1282
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:33,055
And the old world is set up strategically right now

1283
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:37,407
Final conflict between International socialism communism

1284
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:39,711
Calls itself atheism

1285
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:44,063
But it's not it's those who control it worship Lucifer by name

1286
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:47,903
So we did that so pretty it's a pretty concrete similarity

1287
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:49,183
Between him an hour

1288
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:53,791
And also the muddying the Waters of communism

1289
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:54,559
Socialism

1290
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:58,655
Also another pretty big similarities that he believes that

1291
01:01:58,911 --> 01:02:00,191
The Council on Foreign Relations

1292
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:02,239
The globalist plot

1293
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:08,639
CSR in the service okay cool

1294
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:09,919
Cool cool

1295
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:15,807
Policy

1296
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:17,087
Can you prove it

1297
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:18,111
If you can

1298
01:02:18,623 --> 01:02:19,135
How can you

1299
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:19,903
Prove it

1300
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:22,975
Formulation actually

1301
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:25,279
The creation

1302
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:39,359
Greece would be eliminated

1303
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:46,527
Plans

1304
01:02:50,879 --> 01:02:53,951
Obviously the protocols of the Elders of Zion there

1305
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:55,231
So I mean

1306
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:00,351
A big similarity

1307
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:03,167
Similar in beliefs that mean

1308
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:09,567
Very similar

1309
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:10,847
But it's different

1310
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:14,175
Is willing to admit

1311
01:03:14,943 --> 01:03:18,527
He goes on to expound on his ideas about other Council on Foreign Relations

1312
01:03:18,783 --> 01:03:20,831
Hate people who want to put America first

1313
01:03:21,087 --> 01:03:22,623
Pretty precedes out in this

1314
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:23,391
Next clipart

1315
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:24,671
Conspiracy that Alex Jones

1316
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:26,463
Is made very Central to his worldview

1317
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:32,095
Terminology

1318
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:35,423
There is no.

1319
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:36,959
It repulses them

1320
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:40,799
As America

1321
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:42,847
End of quote

1322
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:45,919
He says the Council on Foreign Relations

1323
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:54,879
The Council on Foreign Relations

1324
01:03:56,159 --> 01:03:56,671
Terminology

1325
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:12,287
People in America

1326
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:14,591
Fourth world country

1327
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:15,871
Free so all people

1328
01:04:17,407 --> 01:04:19,711
That's one of Alex's big ideas about

1329
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:21,247
The financial collapse

1330
01:04:21,503 --> 01:04:25,855
Stuff that I need to destroy the economy in order to make everyone

1331
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:28,415
So poor that we can merge with third world

1332
01:04:29,183 --> 01:04:30,207
That is

1333
01:04:30,463 --> 01:04:32,767
Clearly articulated by Smith

1334
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:35,583
Years before Alex ever got on the radio.

1335
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:38,911
This could be Alex's show before Alex

1336
01:04:39,935 --> 01:04:40,703
Very clearly

1337
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:45,823
Alex talk about the Illuminati from time to time especially did earlier in his career

1338
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:47,871
Got it

1339
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:49,663
Talk about it too much now but

1340
01:04:50,175 --> 01:04:52,479
He didn't have that Bugaboo before

1341
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:55,039
I am amazed

1342
01:04:55,295 --> 01:04:55,807
Spy

1343
01:04:56,831 --> 01:04:57,343
That guy

1344
01:04:57,855 --> 01:04:58,367
Turn

1345
01:04:58,879 --> 01:04:59,903
Well so many

1346
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:02,463
Turn this idea of like

1347
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:08,095
Maybe let's not go crazy on the like America First and maybe bring

1348
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:08,863
Alder

1349
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:10,143
Countries and everybody in

1350
01:05:10,399 --> 01:05:10,911
Into the fold

1351
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:11,935
Everybody else

1352
01:05:12,447 --> 01:05:13,215
To this equal place in

1353
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:13,983
Instead of

1354
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:16,031
Keeping all of them down

1355
01:05:16,543 --> 01:05:17,311
And turn that into

1356
01:05:17,567 --> 01:05:23,711
What they're trying to do is kill everybody in America

1357
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:26,783
Rule forever something

1358
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:28,575
Be brothers with everybody

1359
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:30,111
They turn into something

1360
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:31,647
Perverse and awful

1361
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:34,207
How is it that you don't that people just don't go lie

1362
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:35,743
Oh you're an a******

1363
01:05:36,255 --> 01:05:38,303
Right I mean

1364
01:05:38,815 --> 01:05:41,631
A stunt of moral development

1365
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:42,399
To Sonics

1366
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:43,423
Because like

1367
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:44,703
A real

1368
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:47,775
Early form of moral development

1369
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:49,055
Is just sort of

1370
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:54,431
Your own personal

1371
01:05:54,687 --> 01:05:55,711
Nev

1372
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:58,271
Okay so my family

1373
01:05:58,527 --> 01:06:01,855
Write check my family or social group

1374
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:06,719
Developed understand do I need to be doing well

1375
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:08,767
Expand out to a city

1376
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:12,863
The state country mentally you get to the world

1377
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:14,399
Hey just Beatles

1378
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:17,983
Whatever principles

1379
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:19,263
To care for anyone

1380
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:20,543
If you

1381
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:22,335
Didn't think about it long enough

1382
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:24,127
Should become Universal

1383
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:27,455
DIA

1384
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:37,183
America First and those sorts of ideas

1385
01:06:37,695 --> 01:06:38,975
Really are just bad

1386
01:06:39,231 --> 01:06:39,999
Text stopped again

1387
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:43,583
People developing fully on their moral path towards

1388
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:47,423
We're old people

1389
01:06:48,447 --> 01:06:48,959
Anyway

1390
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:52,287
If you really want to look at is the overlap between

1391
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:53,311
Alex Jones

1392
01:06:55,359 --> 01:07:01,503
Another thing I preach constantly the population in order to take over

1393
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:06,623
Carry out an operation

1394
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:08,927
To solve this problem

1395
01:07:30,431 --> 01:07:34,527
The Simpsons

1396
01:07:35,295 --> 01:07:37,343
So he believes much like Alex that in this

1397
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:43,231
The fairy piece of bringing this world government is disarming the population

1398
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:47,839
You see that he also believes that the world government is going to use false-flag

1399
01:07:48,095 --> 01:07:50,399
Type situations in order to pursue their goals

1400
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:56,799
They're going to create circumstances

1401
01:07:57,311 --> 01:08:01,151
The problem reaction solution ideas

1402
01:08:01,663 --> 01:08:04,735
Text sermons where he brings that up very clearly it's

1403
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:07,039
Overlap

1404
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:09,855
Strong

1405
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:12,159
And he believes

1406
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:14,975
What do you mean by that

1407
01:08:15,487 --> 01:08:17,535
There's a lot of s*** that he says that we all know

1408
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:19,583
And he doesn't actually

1409
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:21,375
Made it seems like

1410
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:23,423
Real crazy thing for him to do this

1411
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:24,959
Monopoly

1412
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:26,495
Distance

1413
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:28,799
So scary

1414
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:30,847
So honestly we could do this all day

1415
01:08:31,103 --> 01:08:31,871
Play kalmah

1416
01:08:32,127 --> 01:08:37,247
Conspiracy that Alex Jones believe that the Illuminati or New World Order world government is echoed in the

1417
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:40,063
Federal Reserve is evil text

1418
01:08:42,623 --> 01:08:43,391
Churches have been in

1419
01:08:43,647 --> 01:08:44,927
Infiltrated by the New World Order

1420
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:47,231
There's so much substantiv overlap

1421
01:08:47,743 --> 01:08:49,023
If I'm being honest

1422
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:53,375
Overlap with less interesting to me than some of the more subtle connection

1423
01:08:53,887 --> 01:08:54,399
Confine

1424
01:08:54,655 --> 01:08:55,167
If you pay close

1425
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:55,935
Attention

1426
01:08:57,215 --> 01:09:00,543
David Smith has the exact same habitat

1427
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:01,567
Fake documents

1428
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:02,591
To support his argument

1429
01:09:03,103 --> 01:09:05,919
We already heard him say the protocols of the Elders of Zion is

1430
01:09:06,687 --> 01:09:07,455
In this next clip

1431
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:10,015
He uses another fake document to make his Oregon

1432
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:23,839
Revolution

1433
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:35,103
Albert

1434
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:03,775
Publix

1435
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:14,015
He goes on to talk about it's the Second Amendment

1436
01:10:14,271 --> 01:10:20,415
Something different or similarities

1437
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:24,767
Really 121 parallel

1438
01:10:25,023 --> 01:10:27,583
Revolution

1439
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:31,679
In order to create a fake narrative

1440
01:10:31,935 --> 01:10:37,823
What they're doing is entirely the same as one of them's at a Pulpit in a radio show the other as a studio

1441
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:39,871
That's basically the only difference

1442
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:40,639
Between those clips

1443
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:43,199
George Soros made a lot of people

1444
01:10:43,711 --> 01:10:44,223
FIFA sign

1445
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:46,271
Revolution

1446
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:47,295
Before they

1447
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:50,111
Start all those as number one on the

1448
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:53,951
But it's not just fake documents

1449
01:10:54,207 --> 01:10:56,255
Myself

1450
01:10:56,767 --> 01:10:57,535
Quotes

1451
01:10:58,047 --> 01:10:59,327
Just like Thomas Jefferson

1452
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:02,655
Fake quotes

1453
01:11:03,423 --> 01:11:05,983
George Washington the first president

1454
01:11:07,775 --> 01:11:10,847
I called him

1455
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:13,919
To the Constitution

1456
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:19,295
Liberty

1457
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:20,063
Teeth

1458
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:26,975
That's the fake quote that we talked about that other recent episode

1459
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:29,535
Phraseology that he's using

1460
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:33,375
It's very it's a specific fake walk for both of these dudes to think is real

1461
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:35,935
It tells me that Alex either got this from David's

1462
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:38,495
They're both working all similar sources

1463
01:11:38,751 --> 01:11:41,311
It's the push this way quote I need a reason to go to option

1464
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:42,591
Both are

1465
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:46,687
Both are intertwining these two people as either

1466
01:11:46,943 --> 01:11:49,503
Being in the same Community or Alex

1467
01:11:49,759 --> 01:11:50,271
Taking it

1468
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:52,575
And the similarities don't

1469
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:53,599
There

1470
01:11:53,855 --> 01:11:57,695
International conspiracy from

1471
01:12:00,255 --> 01:12:01,791
This was recorded

1472
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:10,495
He talks about W Cleon skousen talks about none dare call it conspiracy is being great books

1473
01:12:11,519 --> 01:12:12,031
You know what

1474
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:14,847
He seems to admire a lot of the same people that our

1475
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:15,615
What does

1476
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:21,247
I happen to know that there's over 700 banks in the United States according to Senator Rhonda Paul

1477
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:24,319
House of Representative member

1478
01:12:24,575 --> 01:12:26,879
That are now in danger of collapse

1479
01:12:27,391 --> 01:12:33,535
And yet the government won't read the word because if they breathe which companies are which banks they were you and I would go have a

1480
01:12:37,631 --> 01:12:43,775
So you got Financial collapse narrative to Alex's paranoid

1481
01:12:44,031 --> 01:12:44,799
Go to Ron Paul

1482
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:46,847
The room pulls a pretty common purse

1483
01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:48,383
4 weirdo militia types

1484
01:12:48,639 --> 01:12:50,687
Support bizarre

1485
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:53,247
I think it's next one alittle more specific

1486
01:12:54,015 --> 01:12:54,783
We have

1487
01:12:55,295 --> 01:12:56,063
Really

1488
01:12:56,831 --> 01:12:57,855
Not even begun

1489
01:12:58,111 --> 01:12:59,903
To develop our own energy sources

1490
01:13:05,023 --> 01:13:08,095
Play 939 crisis by Lindsey

1491
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:12,191
For he was right there on the spot he had access to all documentation

1492
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:13,727
And he has shown

1493
01:13:13,983 --> 01:13:14,751
Documented

1494
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:16,543
Call Island

1495
01:13:16,799 --> 01:13:17,567
Fine

1496
01:13:17,823 --> 01:13:19,871
What's the largest in the United States

1497
01:13:20,127 --> 01:13:21,151
So

1498
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:23,455
Like I've literally never heard

1499
01:13:23,711 --> 01:13:25,759
Anyone other than Alex Jones reference

1500
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:26,527
Lindsey Williams

1501
01:13:26,783 --> 01:13:32,671
Charlie true I'm sorry I misspoke

1502
01:13:32,927 --> 01:13:33,695
I never wanted

1503
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:34,975
The show is a gas ever again

1504
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:37,279
Beyond that it's just Alex and David Jason

1505
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:39,583
These connections are pretty compelling

1506
01:13:39,839 --> 01:13:41,119
I feel like

1507
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:42,911
We've gotten some

1508
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:44,447
Parallels baofeng

1509
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:45,983
Content

1510
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:47,775
Style substance

1511
01:13:48,287 --> 01:13:49,055
References

1512
01:13:49,567 --> 01:13:50,079
People

1513
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:52,383
Like Lindsey Williams being referenced by both these

1514
01:13:54,175 --> 01:13:58,271
Like when I was looking through that sermon Williams

1515
01:13:58,783 --> 01:14:00,319
Do not expect to hear that there

1516
01:14:00,575 --> 01:14:03,391
But I feel like this last clip that I have of

1517
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:04,415
The sermon

1518
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:05,951
Should jump out at you

1519
01:14:06,463 --> 01:14:07,999
And you should just

1520
01:14:09,023 --> 01:14:10,303
This could easily be equipped

1521
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:14,143
And that's just historical documentation

1522
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:15,167
Which can be found in

1523
01:14:15,423 --> 01:14:16,191
Congressional Record

1524
01:14:17,727 --> 01:14:19,775
And there's even a movie Mike in circulation

1525
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:21,311
Don't table

1526
01:14:21,567 --> 01:14:22,335
Call Red's

1527
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:26,431
You see there and there's a

1528
01:14:26,687 --> 01:14:28,735
My God

1529
01:14:28,991 --> 01:14:32,575
You vaguely cites the Congressional Record but doesn't really get into it

1530
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:33,855
Instead

1531
01:14:34,111 --> 01:14:34,623
Purolator

1532
01:14:34,879 --> 01:14:35,647
2.2 mm movie

1533
01:14:36,415 --> 01:14:39,743
Ethan saying that's exactly the rhetorical style that Alex employee

1534
01:14:39,999 --> 01:14:42,047
It's me that feels like a little bit of a fingerprint

1535
01:14:42,815 --> 01:14:43,839
It's the sort of thing that you can

1536
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:46,399
Like if you listen to a ton of you might

1537
01:14:46,655 --> 01:14:47,679
Adopt

1538
01:14:47,935 --> 01:14:48,703
Into your subconscious

1539
01:14:49,471 --> 01:14:51,519
Especially if you're younger person listening

1540
01:14:51,775 --> 01:14:55,615
Listen to a preacher who had these

1541
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:57,151
These verbal patterns

1542
01:14:57,663 --> 01:14:58,175
It would

1543
01:14:58,431 --> 01:14:59,967
Makes sense that you might

1544
01:15:01,759 --> 01:15:02,527
Perfect movie

1545
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:03,807
To make my point

1546
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:06,623
No I don't know if that

1547
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:10,463
I don't the certainly not concrete but it's enough

1548
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:12,255
Along with all the other stuff

1549
01:15:13,535 --> 01:15:15,839
Coming out to look at similarities

1550
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:18,911
Piling up to mountains of circumstantial evidence

1551
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:21,983
Weaponized

1552
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:22,751
Cupidity

1553
01:15:23,007 --> 01:15:23,775
Like he's

1554
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:24,799
Alex Rivera

1555
01:15:30,431 --> 01:15:30,943
Through here

1556
01:15:31,455 --> 01:15:32,991
It sounds to me like

1557
01:15:33,759 --> 01:15:34,527
David Smith

1558
01:15:35,295 --> 01:15:36,575
So f******

1559
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:37,599
Stupid and crazy

1560
01:15:38,111 --> 01:15:39,135
That he

1561
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:40,415
Inadvertently

1562
01:15:40,671 --> 01:15:42,463
Shot Alex like a missile

1563
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:43,231
Into America

1564
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:48,095
I don't I don't know a hundred percent sure

1565
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:52,447
Hey it's it certainly might have contributed to the funeral

1566
01:15:55,007 --> 01:15:58,591
Small samples of things that I've heard from Smith sermon

1567
01:15:59,103 --> 01:15:59,871
There plenty

1568
01:16:00,127 --> 01:16:01,407
Plenty board examples

1569
01:16:01,663 --> 01:16:02,943
Direct overlap with Alex

1570
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:10,623
I complete you hours of Smith talking and sounding exactly like Alex but ultimately all that can prove is that they believe similar things

1571
01:16:11,135 --> 01:16:13,183
Yo-yo their similarities

1572
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:14,463
Timeline pattern

1573
01:16:14,975 --> 01:16:16,511
That's completely unsatisfying

1574
01:16:16,767 --> 01:16:17,279
Conclusion for me

1575
01:16:17,791 --> 01:16:19,839
I needed to figure out if there was a stronger connection

1576
01:16:20,095 --> 01:16:20,607
Between these two

1577
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:21,631
I kept looking

1578
01:16:22,655 --> 01:16:24,959
Someone left on examined for too long

1579
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:26,239
Add presents on

1580
01:16:26,495 --> 01:16:27,263
Shortwave radio

1581
01:16:28,287 --> 01:16:32,383
For those unaware short-wave signals exist in a band of frequencies

1582
01:16:32,895 --> 01:16:33,407
Huge desk

1583
01:16:34,431 --> 01:16:39,551
Where is a radio signal might only be capable of being picked up in like a 20 mi radius from the transmitter

1584
01:16:39,807 --> 01:16:45,183
Large shortwave transmitters can push a signal out that could be received easily through the entire United States

1585
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:45,951
Further

1586
01:16:46,975 --> 01:16:48,255
Alex always used to tell his audience

1587
01:16:48,511 --> 01:16:50,815
Theron transmitters to broadcasters

1588
01:16:51,071 --> 01:16:52,095
That would definitely help him

1589
01:16:52,351 --> 01:16:53,631
You're playing on more frequent

1590
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:55,935
But it wouldn't do anything to help

1591
01:16:56,191 --> 01:16:57,215
Expand its geographical

1592
01:16:58,751 --> 01:17:02,847
One short wave transmitter to broadcast to show all over the United

1593
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:05,151
Canada

1594
01:17:05,919 --> 01:17:06,687
And that's station

1595
01:17:06,943 --> 01:17:07,711
The does that work

1596
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:09,503
Is wwcr

1597
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:10,527
Out of Nashville Tenn

1598
01:17:11,551 --> 01:17:14,367
Wwcr has an official partnership with Genesis

1599
01:17:14,623 --> 01:17:17,951
Communications Network number their shows broadcast

1600
01:17:18,207 --> 01:17:18,975
From that

1601
01:17:19,487 --> 01:17:22,815
Show me other shows that have been on that Network include the hour of the time

1602
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:24,863
Which was Bill Cooper show before he died

1603
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:30,239
They're also they have a show on there called the intelligence report

1604
01:17:30,495 --> 01:17:32,287
But it was hosted by Mark from Michigan

1605
01:17:32,799 --> 01:17:37,919
Inotorious militia agitator who call into Alex's show

1606
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:41,503
Jack McLamb had a show on wwcr

1607
01:17:41,759 --> 01:17:47,903
If you forget mcclam was a frequent Alex Jones gas to try to create a patriot Utopia in rural Idaho

1608
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:51,743
Along with militia lunatic in hardcore Christian identity

1609
01:17:52,511 --> 01:17:56,095
Wwcr called Freedom call

1610
01:17:56,863 --> 01:18:02,239
There's a show called The Radio free America which is sponsored by the Liberty Lobby and Spotlight magazine

1611
01:18:02,495 --> 01:18:06,079
The anti-semitic ragwear Alex's main Bilderberg Source gym Tucker work

1612
01:18:07,359 --> 01:18:09,407
Wwcr also broadcasted

1613
01:18:09,663 --> 01:18:10,687
Scriptures for America

1614
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:12,735
A radio program hosted by Pete

1615
01:18:12,991 --> 01:18:13,503
Peters

1616
01:18:13,759 --> 01:18:18,879
The Christian identity preacher who organized the fascist organizing Summit the Rocky Mountains

1617
01:18:19,135 --> 01:18:20,671
Which was attended by Aryan Nation

1618
01:18:20,927 --> 01:18:21,951
Leader Louis beam

1619
01:18:22,207 --> 01:18:24,255
Popularizer of the leaderless resistance

1620
01:18:24,511 --> 01:18:28,351
And frequent Alex Jones Larry Pratt

1621
01:18:28,607 --> 01:18:29,631
I've gunownersofamerica

1622
01:18:30,655 --> 01:18:34,239
Wwcr also broadcast David Jay Smith Newswatch

1623
01:18:35,519 --> 01:18:36,799
Wwcr is a

1624
01:18:37,823 --> 01:18:41,663
Christian outlet with the right-wing militia paper

1625
01:18:41,919 --> 01:18:42,431
Community

1626
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:43,711
And you can see that

1627
01:18:43,967 --> 01:18:48,831
Explicit

1628
01:18:49,087 --> 01:18:51,135
Do Alex and his world's you the ideas

1629
01:18:51,391 --> 01:18:53,183
The David Jay Smith show was Brock

1630
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:54,207
Gaston the same

1631
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:56,255
Transmitter station

1632
01:18:56,511 --> 01:18:58,047
On shortwave as Alex and

1633
01:18:58,303 --> 01:18:58,815
And all of these

1634
01:18:59,327 --> 01:19:02,399
Very explicit Christian identity program

1635
01:19:02,911 --> 01:19:03,679
It means something

1636
01:19:07,007 --> 01:19:07,519
Just think of

1637
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:10,079
Some sort of like Polar Opposites

1638
01:19:10,335 --> 01:19:12,895
Is it can you imagine a shortwave radio station that way

1639
01:19:13,151 --> 01:19:15,967
Was just like f****** environmental terrorist

1640
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:19,551
Doing nothing but like probably doesn't know up

1641
01:19:19,807 --> 01:19:20,575
Bro

1642
01:19:20,831 --> 01:19:22,623
Damn every goddamn

1643
01:19:22,879 --> 01:19:27,231
Something close to that might exist cuz I also include a lot of like pirate program

1644
01:19:30,303 --> 01:19:31,839
Broadcast shortwave

1645
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:33,119
With Fair

1646
01:19:33,375 --> 01:19:33,887
Fairly easy

1647
01:19:34,655 --> 01:19:35,423
Abilities

1648
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:37,727
I'm not aware of any terrorist

1649
01:19:37,983 --> 01:19:38,495
Station

1650
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:43,359
What is on par with wwcr

1651
01:19:43,615 --> 01:19:45,151
It it the reach of it is

1652
01:19:48,735 --> 01:19:52,831
Exact coverage map

1653
01:19:54,879 --> 01:19:55,903
Once I could find

1654
01:19:56,159 --> 01:20:00,767
I'm not a hundred percent sure they're accurate but they go all over North America into South America

1655
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:03,839
And in Europe throughout Europe

1656
01:20:04,095 --> 01:20:04,607
And North Ave

1657
01:20:04,863 --> 01:20:06,143
Africa like they have

1658
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:06,911
Coverage

1659
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:08,959
Of an insane

1660
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:10,751
Yeah

1661
01:20:11,007 --> 01:20:13,311
So I think it's I think it's pretty f*****-up

1662
01:20:13,824 --> 01:20:14,336
To see that

1663
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:16,384
It's very clear

1664
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:17,152
Connection

1665
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:23,552
Like why why is Alex on this Christian identity broadcast

1666
01:20:24,064 --> 01:20:25,600
Station that also broadcast

1667
01:20:25,856 --> 01:20:26,368
This preacher

1668
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:28,416
Like it's very strange

1669
01:20:30,464 --> 01:20:30,976
Now it's not

1670
01:20:32,512 --> 01:20:33,024
They're all

1671
01:20:33,536 --> 01:20:34,048
F******

1672
01:20:37,376 --> 01:20:38,400
I don't know man

1673
01:20:38,912 --> 01:20:40,192
Connected

1674
01:20:41,472 --> 01:20:41,984
Tentative enough

1675
01:20:42,752 --> 01:20:44,032
I needed something more concrete

1676
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:46,336
After digging around a little more what should I say

1677
01:20:46,848 --> 01:20:50,176
But it May 14th 2008 episode

1678
01:20:50,432 --> 01:20:51,456
Featuring David Jason

1679
01:20:51,968 --> 01:20:52,480
As the gas

1680
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:54,784
I figured if anything could give me a sign

1681
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:56,832
Sense of Alex's true feelings toward Smith

1682
01:20:57,088 --> 01:20:58,112
A conversation

1683
01:20:58,368 --> 01:20:59,136
Between the two of them

1684
01:20:59,904 --> 01:21:00,416
And here

1685
01:21:00,672 --> 01:21:01,184
Jordan

1686
01:21:01,696 --> 01:21:02,464

1687
01:21:08,608 --> 01:21:09,376

3rd and 4th

1690
01:21:11,936 --> 01:21:13,728
Today Pastor David

1691
01:21:14,752 --> 01:21:17,056
From Waxahachie Texas fighting the New World Order

1692
01:21:17,312 --> 01:21:18,336
For more than 30 years

1693
01:21:19,104 --> 01:21:20,896
Will be joining us on air

1694
01:21:21,408 --> 01:21:22,688
To talk about his neck of the woods

1695
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:24,224
Nearby

1696
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:24,992
The Baptist

1697
01:21:26,016 --> 01:21:26,784
Bible School

1698
01:21:27,296 --> 01:21:29,344
In East Texas where they

1699
01:21:29,856 --> 01:21:31,392
Security come in

1700
01:21:31,648 --> 01:21:32,416
And tell members

1701
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:34,720
Arrested

1702
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,280
Espionage

1703
01:21:37,536 --> 01:21:39,328
Speak about the Bill of Rights and Constitution

1704
01:21:39,584 --> 01:21:44,704
That's a little bit of a sort of mischaracterization of what's going on

1705
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:50,336
Really Loosely to make it sound like David G Smith church has anything to do with his church that allegedly had

1706
01:21:50,592 --> 01:21:51,616
Homeland Security

1707
01:21:51,872 --> 01:21:54,688
Disconnect

1708
01:21:54,944 --> 01:21:56,480
Baby Geographic

1709
01:21:56,736 --> 01:22:01,600
Berkeley close to of like this church

1710
01:22:02,368 --> 01:22:03,136
In a preacher

1711
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:05,952
And you are you run your risk of your taxi

1712
01:22:06,208 --> 01:22:10,048
Example for or against

1713
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:11,072
Pacific policy

1714
01:22:11,328 --> 01:22:12,096
Ways to vote

1715
01:22:12,352 --> 01:22:12,864
Candidates

1716
01:22:13,376 --> 01:22:13,888
Did you want to

1717
01:22:14,144 --> 01:22:14,656
Keep those things

1718
01:22:15,168 --> 01:22:17,984
Easy to see how if you're running a church

1719
01:22:18,496 --> 01:22:19,008
You could

1720
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:20,288
Election metal

1721
01:22:20,544 --> 01:22:21,824
Yeah yeah

1722
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:23,360
Local election

1723
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:25,920
Write set up a machine

1724
01:22:26,176 --> 01:22:27,712
Churches were allowed to

1725
01:22:27,968 --> 01:22:28,736
To be political

1726
01:22:28,992 --> 01:22:32,576
Tools that we know now for sure that churches are not

1727
01:22:32,832 --> 01:22:33,600
Political tools

1728
01:22:33,856 --> 01:22:34,624
At Albright

1729
01:22:35,136 --> 01:22:35,648
It's awesome

1730
01:22:36,672 --> 01:22:37,184
So good that

1731
01:22:41,792 --> 01:22:43,584
That seems like a pretty positive thing for Alex

1732
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:46,656
Pretty enthusiastic about him

1733
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:48,704
Even calls

1734
01:22:54,336 --> 01:22:55,872
For decades and decades

1735
01:22:56,128 --> 01:22:59,200
On the show they've all been done before many of them have been on you and years

1736
01:23:00,224 --> 01:23:00,992
I just remembered again

1737
01:23:01,248 --> 01:23:02,272
Undertale try to try to get

1738
01:23:03,296 --> 01:23:04,320
It was Health allowed

1739
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:06,880
Few years and he's a WWII

1740
01:23:07,136 --> 01:23:08,160
He really is

1741
01:23:08,672 --> 01:23:09,696
The great granddaddy

1742
01:23:10,208 --> 01:23:10,976
Dial Mom

1743
01:23:11,232 --> 01:23:13,280
So you know

1744
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:14,560
Viking icon

1745
01:23:15,584 --> 01:23:17,632
David Smith and redback

1746
01:23:17,888 --> 01:23:18,400
Icon

1747
01:23:18,912 --> 01:23:19,680
Despite icon

1748
01:23:20,192 --> 01:23:22,752
But read back the past episodes

1749
01:23:23,008 --> 01:23:24,544
To deeply back into him

1750
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:28,128
But in case anyone needs a reminder when was one of the guys

1751
01:23:28,384 --> 01:23:30,688
16th Amendment is a fraud and you shouldn't have to pay taxes

1752
01:23:31,456 --> 01:23:33,760
He also wrote a book called The Church deceive

1753
01:23:34,272 --> 01:23:35,040
Where you at

1754
01:23:35,296 --> 01:23:37,856
Thoughts about what the Jews went through in World War II

1755
01:23:39,136 --> 01:23:42,464
It was judgement not Holocaust

1756
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:45,280
The true and almighty God use the evil Nazi government

1757
01:23:45,536 --> 01:23:46,560
Form judgement

1758
01:23:46,816 --> 01:23:47,328
The evil answer

1759
01:23:47,584 --> 01:23:48,352
Christ religion

1760
01:23:48,608 --> 01:23:50,144
Of those who crucified the Christ

1761
01:23:50,912 --> 01:23:52,448
To the Holocaust

1762
01:23:53,984 --> 01:23:55,520
Nazis

1763
01:23:56,032 --> 01:23:59,872
Put into the Holocaust which kind of sounds

1764
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:04,736
Red Beckman was a bigwig in early Christian identity Circle

1765
01:24:04,992 --> 01:24:07,552
Call switch strongly indicates

1766
01:24:07,808 --> 01:24:08,576
Something as consul

1767
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:11,392
This is further indicated by his

1768
01:24:11,648 --> 01:24:12,672
Contention that non-white

1769
01:24:12,928 --> 01:24:13,440
Armada

1770
01:24:14,208 --> 01:24:20,096
She says which we clearly have heard David basement say that black people because of a prank on Noah or servants

1771
01:24:20,352 --> 01:24:21,376
Perpetuity

1772
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:26,240
When Alex says that you're an icon in a particular field on par with red Beckman

1773
01:24:26,496 --> 01:24:27,520
You are being called a race

1774
01:24:28,032 --> 01:24:29,056
And an anti-semite

1775
01:24:29,568 --> 01:24:30,080
That is

1776
01:24:30,592 --> 01:24:36,736
What red Beckman stock-in-trade is

1777
01:24:40,064 --> 01:24:43,136
That is a positive in his world

1778
01:24:43,648 --> 01:24:44,160
But it is

1779
01:24:44,672 --> 01:24:45,952
It is not

1780
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:47,232
I maybe

1781
01:24:47,744 --> 01:24:49,280
So interesting

1782
01:24:49,536 --> 01:24:50,816
Alex get the call

1783
01:24:51,072 --> 01:24:53,376
On this episode

1784
01:24:53,632 --> 01:24:54,912
What are people that I've been paying

1785
01:24:55,168 --> 01:24:56,448
Nope

1786
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:59,520
It's a it's a it's the racist old guy

1787
01:24:59,776 --> 01:25:01,568
Chicago you're on the air

1788
01:25:02,592 --> 01:25:03,616
I'd like to say

1789
01:25:05,664 --> 01:25:06,176
Virginia trip

1790
01:25:06,432 --> 01:25:06,944
Backup

1791
01:25:07,456 --> 01:25:08,224
Imma riding Ram

1792
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:09,248
Rampaging black

1793
01:25:10,784 --> 01:25:11,552
I don't know if you saw this

1794
01:25:12,576 --> 01:25:13,088
Oh yes wait

1795
01:25:14,624 --> 01:25:17,952
Alex is frustrated you can hear it that

1796
01:25:20,256 --> 01:25:22,304
His show at this point as a character

1797
01:25:22,816 --> 01:25:24,608
Set is okay to be like

1798
01:25:26,144 --> 01:25:27,680
Racist guys.

1799
01:25:27,936 --> 01:25:34,080
Preacher who prior to this has given sermon about how black people are slave

1800
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:34,848
Forever

1801
01:25:35,872 --> 01:25:36,384
Congruence

1802
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:37,408
A little bit

1803
01:25:37,664 --> 01:25:38,688
But

1804
01:25:38,944 --> 01:25:42,528
The presentation publicly to be alright Got This Racist calling in

1805
01:25:42,784 --> 01:25:44,064
I've got to be

1806
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:47,904
Not on board with him because when he says the rampaging black beast

1807
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:49,952
What are you talkin about is the primaries

1808
01:25:50,464 --> 01:25:53,024
Because we're in May 22,000

1809
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:54,560
Primary season

1810
01:25:55,584 --> 01:25:58,144
So he's talking about pushing back again

1811
01:25:59,424 --> 01:26:00,448
Alex

1812
01:26:00,704 --> 01:26:01,728
Can't allow that

1813
01:26:01,984 --> 01:26:03,264
To be on the show

1814
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:04,288
So overt

1815
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:07,872
And he pushes back and it just makes lip which is something

1816
01:26:08,128 --> 01:26:08,896
You never here

1817
01:26:10,176 --> 01:26:10,688

Street dance with

The VA

1824
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:19,136
West Virginia map

1825
01:26:19,392 --> 01:26:19,904

Can't hear the music

1829
01:26:27,328 --> 01:26:28,864
We don't need to call people black

1830
01:26:29,888 --> 01:26:32,192
Crazy dear Alex amen

1831
01:26:32,448 --> 01:26:32,960
Isn't it

1832
01:26:33,472 --> 01:26:38,336
It is especially considering other. The time in that like

1833
01:26:38,592 --> 01:26:39,616
More recently

1834
01:26:39,872 --> 01:26:44,992
And Alex's brand is completely change to the point where you can't say things like

1835
01:26:45,504 --> 01:26:48,064
No point

1836
01:26:49,344 --> 01:26:54,464
His thigh isn't like this guy saying something wrong it's like you're giving up the game

1837
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:55,744
Stop it

1838
01:26:56,256 --> 01:26:58,048
You're forcing me to

1839
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:04,704
Explicitly denounced you had a good time

1840
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:13,920
So

1841
01:27:14,432 --> 01:27:14,944
And

1842
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:16,480
It's not really

1843
01:27:16,992 --> 01:27:18,272
That great of an interview

1844
01:27:18,784 --> 01:27:22,880
Enforce the ideas that he has about the clergy response

1845
01:27:23,648 --> 01:27:24,672
Which is essentially the

1846
01:27:24,928 --> 01:27:26,464
Notion

1847
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:28,256
FEMA has placed

1848
01:27:28,512 --> 01:27:32,352
Infiltrators in churches in order to get them to go along with putting people in

1849
01:27:33,376 --> 01:27:36,448
Episode

1850
01:27:37,216 --> 01:27:40,800
Smith doesn't really have anything to say other than

1851
01:27:41,056 --> 01:27:44,640
Okay crazy that

1852
01:27:44,896 --> 01:27:45,664
Churches to have them

1853
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:46,944
Be okay with putting people in

1854
01:27:47,712 --> 01:27:52,832
Like people in churches are just automatically okay with me now

1855
01:27:53,088 --> 01:27:54,624
So in this

1856
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:56,672
Clip hear from David Jay Smith

1857
01:27:56,928 --> 01:27:57,440
If he talks

1858
01:27:57,696 --> 01:27:58,208
About

1859
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:01,792
Which is

1860
01:28:02,048 --> 01:28:02,816
Weird

1861
01:28:03,072 --> 01:28:03,840
Do your come up on Alex

1862
01:28:04,096 --> 01:28:04,864
How to show because

01:28:09,472 --> 01:28:11,008
And we know that the Rothschild

1865
01:28:11,264 --> 01:28:11,776
Another

1866
01:28:12,032 --> 01:28:12,800
International Bank

1867
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:16,384
All of this to get its start

1868
01:28:17,664 --> 01:28:19,200
Show show how do

1869
01:28:19,456 --> 01:28:20,736
How did the Hebrews

1870
01:28:22,784 --> 01:28:23,808
Two different

1871
01:28:24,576 --> 01:28:25,856
You got two different items here

1872
01:28:26,368 --> 01:28:27,136
Number one

1873
01:28:27,648 --> 01:28:28,672
There were Twelve Tribes

1874
01:28:30,464 --> 01:28:31,744
And the northern

1875
01:28:33,024 --> 01:28:33,792
Squared away

1876
01:28:34,048 --> 01:28:36,352
The tribe of Judah and Benjamin because

1877
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:37,888
Perelman Center

1878
01:28:40,192 --> 01:28:41,216
We'll give them relief

1879
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:44,544
Hayward Bell

1880
01:28:51,456 --> 01:28:57,600
Rewriting the Bible to be like at George Washington

1881
01:28:57,856 --> 01:28:58,880
You know what though it's not

1882
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:01,184
I call Leanne.

1883
01:29:01,696 --> 01:29:05,280
Cuz reborn part of the reason that he was such an awful L was

1884
01:29:05,536 --> 01:29:08,352
Like you said he was going to raise more taxes

1885
01:29:08,608 --> 01:29:12,448
Right right

1886
01:29:12,704 --> 01:29:13,984
Slight that you made against

1887
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:14,752
People

1888
01:29:15,008 --> 01:29:15,776
The tribe

1889
01:29:16,288 --> 01:29:18,336
They let them see likes f*** this

1890
01:29:18,592 --> 01:29:19,360
We are not

1891
01:29:19,616 --> 01:29:20,896
It takes a she was a part of it

1892
01:29:21,152 --> 01:29:22,432
It certainly wasn't the whole story

1893
01:29:22,944 --> 01:29:24,224
Interesting

1894
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:26,016
You take that piece of it you make it

1895
01:29:26,272 --> 01:29:29,856
So Central because you're hanging out with that all of these

1896
01:29:30,112 --> 01:29:31,136
Text agitators

1897
01:29:31,392 --> 01:29:32,160
In XO

1898
01:29:32,672 --> 01:29:35,488
That's the important piece that's why those ten tribes

1899
01:29:38,048 --> 01:29:39,584
It's a it's a rewriting but

1900
01:29:40,096 --> 01:29:40,864
You know if it's

1901
01:29:42,912 --> 01:29:43,936
That Alex's

1902
01:29:44,448 --> 01:29:45,216
Not pushing back on it

1903
01:29:47,264 --> 01:29:50,336
I think he's just like well I introduced this guy is an icon

1904
01:29:50,848 --> 01:29:53,152
I have to make this a smooth as possible

1905
01:29:53,408 --> 01:29:55,200
But just at

1906
01:29:55,456 --> 01:29:56,480
Too far into the

1907
01:29:56,736 --> 01:29:58,528
Jews are

1908
01:30:03,392 --> 01:30:05,696
He has to walk that line

1909
01:30:05,952 --> 01:30:08,768
Manages to do it successfully although

1910
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:11,584
David Smith.

1911
01:30:12,096 --> 01:30:13,376
Alright

1912
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:19,264
Majority of the bar MX

1913
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:20,032
Pacific Tan hours

1914
01:30:20,288 --> 01:30:21,824
Galveston pushback on that

1915
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:22,592
Which is very weird

1916
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:25,664
We have one last clip

1917
01:30:26,176 --> 01:30:29,248
From this episode

1918
01:30:29,504 --> 01:30:31,296
Ben and what I was looking for iPhone

1919
01:30:34,112 --> 01:30:35,392
Some really matter me all that much

1920
01:30:39,488 --> 01:30:42,048
Wheel of Fortune they're never going away or bring up neck

1921
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:44,352
Going back to pass

1922
01:30:45,632 --> 01:30:46,144
Get out

1923
01:30:46,656 --> 01:30:47,680
Is phone number in contacts

1924
01:30:48,192 --> 01:30:48,704
Great books

1925
01:30:49,984 --> 01:30:50,496
Write research

1926
01:30:50,752 --> 01:30:51,520
I've learned so much

1927
01:30:55,104 --> 01:30:58,944
So you have the things I was looking for all along

1928
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:02,016
When you go in and you look at it too

1929
01:31:02,528 --> 01:31:03,040
David Jason

1930
01:31:03,808 --> 01:31:04,576
You find

1931
01:31:04,832 --> 01:31:06,112
So much heavy over

1932
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:07,392
You find

1933
01:31:07,648 --> 01:31:08,928
So much with the

1934
01:31:09,184 --> 01:31:11,232
One exception being this British has

1935
01:31:11,488 --> 01:31:12,000
Israel list

1936
01:31:12,256 --> 01:31:12,768
Belize

1937
01:31:13,024 --> 01:31:13,792
But Alex doesn't

1938
01:31:14,048 --> 01:31:14,560
Professor

1939
01:31:15,328 --> 01:31:15,840
Victor's

1940
01:31:16,096 --> 01:31:17,632
So much overlap

1941
01:31:17,888 --> 01:31:20,192
Between the conception of the New World Order

1942
01:31:20,448 --> 01:31:20,960
The

1943
01:31:21,216 --> 01:31:23,776
Stewardesses the people the narrative

1944
01:31:24,032 --> 01:31:26,080
All of it matches

1945
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:27,872
Much

1946
01:31:28,128 --> 01:31:30,944
Then you find that they're on the same shortwave station

1947
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:32,480
And make his broadcast with

1948
01:31:33,504 --> 01:31:36,320
You know he was operating out of the city 30 miles

1949
01:31:36,576 --> 01:31:39,648
Away from Alex's childhood home

1950
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:42,720
Damn it there's so much here that seems very similar

1951
01:31:42,976 --> 01:31:44,768
But it's not really definitive

1952
01:31:45,536 --> 01:31:47,072
Can you listen to the two of them talk

1953
01:31:47,584 --> 01:31:49,120
And Alex says that he's learned so much

1954
01:31:50,144 --> 01:31:51,680
16 to 17 years

1955
01:31:52,192 --> 01:31:52,704
Since he's woken up

1956
01:31:53,728 --> 01:31:54,240
To David

1957
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:58,080
Yeah it does seem like all that he really did was

1958
01:31:59,104 --> 01:31:59,616
Send to David Smith

1959
01:31:59,872 --> 01:32:00,384
Showing

1960
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:01,664
Maybe instead of

1961
01:32:02,176 --> 01:32:03,200
Do I say globulus

1962
01:32:04,992 --> 01:32:05,504
Help make a

1963
01:32:06,528 --> 01:32:07,808
And maybe

1964
01:32:08,064 --> 01:32:11,392
You know I used some of the the sources

1965
01:32:12,416 --> 01:32:14,208
Go in some other direction

1966
01:32:14,464 --> 01:32:15,232
It seems

1967
01:32:15,488 --> 01:32:18,048
To me almost impossible to imagine that Alex wasn't heavy

1968
01:32:18,816 --> 01:32:22,656
Alex is smart enough to know that like

1969
01:32:23,168 --> 01:32:25,984
If I am to be open about a lot of this

1970
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:26,752
Enough

1971
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:31,104
And where I'm getting these ideas from

1972
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:34,688
People will be able to trace it down too easily and then they be like

1973
01:32:35,968 --> 01:32:38,016
Oh dude hold my friend

1974
01:32:39,552 --> 01:32:42,880
You are getting your ideas from a white supremacist preacher

1975
01:32:43,136 --> 01:32:45,696
Anti-semite of the highest order

1976
01:32:45,952 --> 01:32:47,232
Complete f****** weirdo

1977
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:49,792
That you wants to be

1978
01:32:50,048 --> 01:32:53,120
Casinos like these ideas coming from an intellectual place right

1979
01:32:53,632 --> 01:32:55,168
I don't know somebody who's above

1980
01:32:55,424 --> 01:32:55,936
Ident

1981
01:32:56,192 --> 01:32:56,704
City politics

1982
01:32:57,728 --> 01:33:00,288
Necessarily

1983
01:33:00,544 --> 01:33:01,568
All of Alex's

1984
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:02,592
Is come from

1985
01:33:03,104 --> 01:33:07,712
David Jason

1986
01:33:07,968 --> 01:33:08,992
His inspiration

1987
01:33:09,504 --> 01:33:10,016
Piece of

1988
01:33:10,272 --> 01:33:11,296
His backstory

1989
01:33:11,552 --> 01:33:14,368
That is an exam it and it's something

1990
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:15,392
You don't

1991
01:33:15,648 --> 01:33:16,928
Really realize

1992
01:33:17,184 --> 01:33:17,696
Until

1993
01:33:18,208 --> 01:33:18,720
Alex

1994
01:33:18,976 --> 01:33:20,256
Phones for a week

1995
01:33:20,512 --> 01:33:25,120
Who's the preacher talking about

1996
01:33:25,632 --> 01:33:26,144
Very

1997
01:33:27,424 --> 01:33:29,472
Before we get out of here there's there's something else

1998
01:33:29,728 --> 01:33:30,752
I want address

1999
01:33:31,008 --> 01:33:32,800
It's probably been in the background of everybody

2000
01:33:33,056 --> 01:33:33,824
As we've been

2001
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:34,592
Been going through this

2002
01:33:35,104 --> 01:33:37,664
Is that is how much Alex Jones talks about Birthright

2003
01:33:38,688 --> 01:33:39,712
And the fact

2004
01:33:39,968 --> 01:33:40,992
It's so Central

2005
01:33:41,248 --> 01:33:42,016
David Smith

2006
01:33:43,552 --> 01:33:45,600
Philosophy theology ideology

2007
01:33:47,136 --> 01:33:48,416
Alex constantly

2008
01:33:48,672 --> 01:33:49,440
In the present day

2009
01:33:49,696 --> 01:33:50,464
Talks about

2010
01:33:50,976 --> 01:33:51,744
Trump

2011
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:54,560
Reasserting America

2012
01:33:54,816 --> 01:33:55,328
Cuz Birthright

2013
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:56,352
In the world

2014
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:57,632
And

2015
01:33:57,888 --> 01:33:59,168
For a very long time

2016
01:33:59,424 --> 01:34:00,704
I just took that

2017
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:01,728
To me in like

2018
01:34:03,776 --> 01:34:04,544
Do you know

2019
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:07,360
I took to be along the same lines as his like

2020
01:34:08,128 --> 01:34:09,408
Liberty 1776

2021
01:34:09,664 --> 01:34:14,272
Text 2.0 America is a complete

2022
01:34:14,528 --> 01:34:15,552
Different country

2023
01:34:15,808 --> 01:34:17,600
Existed

2024
01:34:17,856 --> 01:34:19,648
Before

2025
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:23,488
But when I listen to hours and hours and hours of David

2026
01:34:23,744 --> 01:34:24,256
AJ Smith

2027
01:34:24,768 --> 01:34:25,536
Yukon

2028
01:34:25,792 --> 01:34:27,072
Harping on the idea

2029
01:34:27,584 --> 01:34:29,888
Jacob got the birthright

2030
01:34:30,144 --> 01:34:31,680
Esau Esau husband

2031
01:34:31,936 --> 01:34:32,960
We're trying to take it back

2032
01:34:34,496 --> 01:34:40,128
International communism creating a World War World Order a world government

2033
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:44,480
The specific wording of it is just too much for me

2034
01:34:47,552 --> 01:34:49,088
So I decided to go back

2035
01:34:49,344 --> 01:34:50,112
Listen

2036
01:34:50,368 --> 01:34:51,648
To some of Alex

2037
01:34:51,904 --> 01:34:52,928
Onondaga Nation

2038
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:55,232
And

2039
01:34:55,488 --> 01:34:56,768
This clip stuck out

2040
01:34:58,048 --> 01:34:59,328
First off let me just

2041
01:35:02,656 --> 01:35:05,216
Undoubtedly

2042
01:35:05,984 --> 01:35:06,496
Dishwasher

2043
01:35:06,752 --> 01:35:07,520
Providence

2044
01:35:07,776 --> 01:35:09,824
American destiny

2045
01:35:10,336 --> 01:35:11,616
This was Trump

2046
01:35:13,664 --> 01:35:14,432
Office Republic

2047
01:35:14,688 --> 01:35:15,200
George Washing

2048
01:35:15,456 --> 01:35:15,968
You talked about

2049
01:35:16,224 --> 01:35:16,992
And that probably

2050
01:35:23,392 --> 01:35:25,952
They were going to invoke

2051
01:35:28,768 --> 01:35:30,304
And I haven't talked about this

2052
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:31,328
I knew

2053
01:35:31,584 --> 01:35:34,144
What was about to happen and I said I got a tweet

2054
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:39,008
But they're going to invoke

2055
01:35:54,368 --> 01:35:56,928
Spirit of America

2056
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:06,656
And empower the globe

2057
01:36:07,424 --> 01:36:07,936
So

2058
01:36:08,448 --> 01:36:11,776
You know though it's the context in which he's talking about the birthright

2059
01:36:12,032 --> 01:36:13,312
Being really involved

2060
01:36:14,336 --> 01:36:19,200
Really sounds a lot more like David J Smith's version of the birthright

2061
01:36:21,248 --> 01:36:24,832
Fanciful ideas but I might have had it like

2062
01:36:25,856 --> 01:36:28,672
Satisfying

2063
01:36:28,928 --> 01:36:29,952
I'm still on one level

2064
01:36:30,464 --> 01:36:30,976
Because

2065
01:36:31,488 --> 01:36:32,256
I don't feel

2066
01:36:32,512 --> 01:36:33,792
I feel on one

2067
01:36:34,816 --> 01:36:35,584
Outside

2068
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:37,120
Very satisfied

2069
01:36:37,376 --> 01:36:39,936
My conclusion is that Alex Jones

2070
01:36:44,544 --> 01:36:45,312
He has been

2071
01:36:45,568 --> 01:36:47,616
Aware of and

2072
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:49,152
Nose

2073
01:36:49,408 --> 01:36:51,712
What David J Smith stands for in season 2B

2074
01:36:51,968 --> 01:36:52,480
Nikon

2075
01:36:52,736 --> 01:36:53,504
In this world

2076
01:36:55,808 --> 01:36:57,344
That investigation

2077
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:58,624
Open-and-shut complete

2078
01:36:59,648 --> 01:37:05,792
The question of whether or not Alex believes the birthright that he talks about all the fun

2079
01:37:06,816 --> 01:37:09,376
Is the same thing the David Jason

2080
01:37:09,632 --> 01:37:10,400
Believe that to be

2081
01:37:10,656 --> 01:37:14,240
Namely white people have dominion over the world

2082
01:37:14,496 --> 01:37:18,336
To me it's still an open question

2083
01:37:18,592 --> 01:37:23,200
Christian imperialist I don't know if he's the British Israel is

2084
01:37:23,456 --> 01:37:26,016
But he's definitely

2085
01:37:26,528 --> 01:37:30,368
Anglo Israel

2086
01:37:30,624 --> 01:37:34,464
But maybe that's the only thing that kept him away from being a British

2087
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:35,232
Imperialism

2088
01:37:39,072 --> 01:37:42,912
I think the only thing that's keeping them away is

2089
01:37:43,936 --> 01:37:44,960
People will treat him

2090
01:37:45,472 --> 01:37:46,752
Appropriately

2091
01:37:47,008 --> 01:37:49,568
Gucci belt

2092
01:37:51,104 --> 01:37:52,896
Baby Christian identity

2093
01:37:53,152 --> 01:37:56,480
Yeah play that clip inauguration

2094
01:37:56,992 --> 01:37:59,808
Hey I remember that and I remember thinking about

2095
01:38:01,088 --> 01:38:02,368
Obviously years ago

2096
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:03,904
But

2097
01:38:04,416 --> 01:38:05,184
I remember

2098
01:38:05,696 --> 01:38:06,208
Thinking like

2099
01:38:06,464 --> 01:38:08,256
Birthright just being like a

2100
01:38:08,512 --> 01:38:11,072
I was born in America and so on

2101
01:38:11,328 --> 01:38:11,840
And so forth

2102
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:14,400
It's so much more charge

2103
01:38:14,912 --> 01:38:15,680
Now that I have this

2104
01:38:15,936 --> 01:38:16,704
History of like under

2105
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:17,728
Understanding

2106
01:38:17,984 --> 01:38:24,128
That also means that black people are slaves forever

2107
01:38:24,384 --> 01:38:27,456
Today obviously puts a little bit of a

2108
01:38:28,992 --> 01:38:29,760
Contacts.

2109
01:38:30,016 --> 01:38:31,296
Possible

2110
01:38:31,552 --> 01:38:32,320
Yeah

2111
01:38:32,832 --> 01:38:34,112
You know separate from that

2112
01:38:34,624 --> 01:38:37,696
We have also heard him talk about Birthright

2113
01:38:37,952 --> 01:38:39,744
A ton

2114
01:38:42,048 --> 01:38:44,864
Texted when she talked about it never made it clear

2115
01:38:45,376 --> 01:38:46,144
And the only thing

2116
01:38:47,424 --> 01:38:47,936
Suggest

2117
01:38:48,448 --> 01:38:49,984
A slight clearing up already stalking

2118
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:52,032
He's looking at

2119
01:38:52,288 --> 01:38:54,080
How's that word is used by somebody

2120
01:38:54,336 --> 01:38:58,176
Who clearly he thinks as an icon and is someone who

2121
01:38:58,432 --> 01:39:00,480
He's been aware of for over a decade and a half

2122
01:39:00,736 --> 01:39:02,016
At at the point of

2123
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:06,112
615

2124
01:39:06,368 --> 01:39:07,904
15 years old when he first came in,

2125
01:39:08,672 --> 01:39:10,208
With with

2126
01:39:11,232 --> 01:39:12,000
So I don't know

2127
01:39:12,256 --> 01:39:14,304
Exotics

2128
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:16,608
As question of

2129
01:39:17,632 --> 01:39:19,424
How much exactly Alex

2130
01:39:20,192 --> 01:39:21,472
Is in line with him

2131
01:39:21,984 --> 01:39:26,592
But from my assessment and looking at Alex Jones have over the course of

2132
01:39:28,384 --> 01:39:28,896
I mean

2133
01:39:32,736 --> 01:39:33,504
He uses

2134
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:36,320
Terms like Birthright in the way he does

2135
01:39:36,576 --> 01:39:37,600
As code

2136
01:39:38,112 --> 01:39:39,392
I think so

2137
01:39:39,904 --> 01:39:40,672
When's it going to keep

2138
01:39:40,928 --> 01:39:41,440
Thinking about

2139
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:43,232
Today is

2140
01:39:44,512 --> 01:39:46,304
Superman out

2141
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:47,072
Stop the

2142
01:39:47,584 --> 01:39:48,608
Stop light

2143
01:39:51,424 --> 01:39:52,960
In the fifties on the radio they had

2144
01:39:54,496 --> 01:39:55,008
Destination

2145
01:39:55,264 --> 01:39:56,800
Subdued

2146
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:01,408
Superman

2147
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:02,432
Radios

2148
01:40:03,456 --> 01:40:03,968
2

2149
01:40:04,224 --> 01:40:05,504
Reveal how stupid

2150
01:40:06,528 --> 01:40:08,576
The leader is the Grand Dragon

2151
01:40:11,392 --> 01:40:11,904
That there

2152
01:40:12,160 --> 01:40:13,440
Secret rituals

2153
01:40:15,488 --> 01:40:16,000
Yeah

2154
01:40:16,256 --> 01:40:16,768
And

2155
01:40:17,536 --> 01:40:20,864
That did so much to stem the growth of

2156
01:40:23,168 --> 01:40:24,192
Ziggy like

2157
01:40:24,448 --> 01:40:25,728
If we had that same

2158
01:40:25,984 --> 01:40:26,496
Situation to

2159
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:32,128
It would not take the girl

2160
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:38,016
Enough people would call you back before you know it

2161
01:40:38,272 --> 01:40:40,832
You take any kind of stigmata way

2162
01:40:41,088 --> 01:40:41,856
Yeah

2163
01:40:42,112 --> 01:40:42,624
It's a bummer

2164
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:49,024
I don't know how there's like real solid conclusion in this other than

2165
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:50,048
Stumbled upon

2166
01:40:50,304 --> 01:40:51,328
Really f***** up

2167
01:40:51,584 --> 01:40:52,608
Inspiration

2168
01:40:52,864 --> 01:40:53,376
A Alex Jones

2169
01:40:53,632 --> 01:40:54,144
Over the years

2170
01:40:55,168 --> 01:40:55,936
It troubles me

2171
01:40:56,448 --> 01:40:57,472
Two level I can barely

2172
01:40:57,984 --> 01:40:58,496
Yeah

2173
01:41:01,568 --> 01:41:02,080
No.

2174
01:41:02,336 --> 01:41:03,104
Rest of the

2175
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:04,128
Stuff in his shows

2176
01:41:04,896 --> 01:41:09,248
I were talking about so we're good

2177
01:41:09,504 --> 01:41:15,648
This is the value of that

2178
01:41:17,952 --> 01:41:18,720
Find any other way

2179
01:41:19,232 --> 01:41:20,768
Before I met

2180
01:41:22,304 --> 01:41:22,816
You still living

2181
01:41:27,168 --> 01:41:28,448
Maybe just a little

2182
01:41:29,984 --> 01:41:34,592
So let's go

2183
01:41:34,848 --> 01:41:37,408
Two people

2184
01:41:37,664 --> 01:41:39,456
To come closer to catching up

2185
01:41:39,712 --> 01:41:41,504
Which we won't be able to do honestly

2186
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:43,552
Unless we start giving shout-outs

2187
01:41:43,808 --> 01:41:44,576
People as a group

2188
01:41:44,832 --> 01:41:49,696
I don't know if I want it might be disrespectful

2189
01:41:49,952 --> 01:41:50,976
Yeah

2190
01:41:51,232 --> 01:41:54,560
President of individual sound drops being played and now it's true

2191
01:41:54,816 --> 01:41:59,168
Backed into a corner I don't know what we're going to do

2192
01:42:04,032 --> 01:42:09,664
Next time someone who's coming in at the technocrat level thank you so much

2193
01:42:10,432 --> 01:42:10,944
Turing

2194
01:42:11,456 --> 01:42:14,784
My calendar

2195
01:42:17,344 --> 01:42:19,904
We met them but we also

2196
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:30,144
Business

2197
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:32,192
Money off at heroin

2198
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:36,800
Freakishly large

2199
01:42:43,456 --> 01:42:45,248
Really

2200
01:42:45,504 --> 01:42:46,272
Next

2201
01:42:48,064 --> 01:42:49,600
You're now a policy wonk

2202
01:42:52,416 --> 01:42:55,744
Aaron you are now a policy wonk

2203
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:02,912
Finally a little elevated

2204
01:43:03,168 --> 01:43:03,680
Greg

2205
01:43:03,936 --> 01:43:04,960
You are now a technic

2206
01:43:15,968 --> 01:43:17,760
Heroin

2207
01:43:19,808 --> 01:43:21,600
Freakishly large

2208
01:43:24,672 --> 01:43:26,464
Thank you so much great thank you

2209
01:43:26,976 --> 01:43:33,120
How much are we doing group

2210
01:43:33,376 --> 01:43:36,192
Oceans as a technocrat

2211
01:43:36,448 --> 01:43:39,264
We'll see moving forward

2212
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:41,568
And that we cannot do without you

2213
01:43:41,824 --> 01:43:44,128
And we have made it to the end of what I would describe

2214
01:43:45,408 --> 01:43:46,176
Episode

2215
01:43:46,688 --> 01:43:52,832
Fort Lauderdale

2216
01:43:53,344 --> 01:43:56,672
It is important to get through this cuz it's only because now we're through into March

2217
01:43:56,928 --> 01:43:59,488
Very excited closer to

2218
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:02,816
Wow the release of Terminator 2

2219
01:44:03,072 --> 01:44:07,680
Also I should point out I believe Illinois last episode

2220
01:44:07,936 --> 01:44:09,728
Teasing that big news was coming up

2221
01:44:09,984 --> 01:44:16,128
He had investigators working alright behind the scenes footage

2222
01:44:18,176 --> 01:44:21,504
Completely dropped

2223
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:23,552
How about that

2224
01:44:27,392 --> 01:44:29,440
We do have a website it's knowledge

2225
01:44:29,696 --> 01:44:35,328

01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:45,312
You should do

2230
01:44:45,568 --> 01:44:47,872
Is write a little note

2231
01:44:48,128 --> 01:44:49,152
Get a rubber band

2232
01:44:49,664 --> 01:44:51,712
Tape the note on Iraq

2233
01:44:51,968 --> 01:44:53,760
Put the rubber band around those 22

2234
01:44:54,016 --> 01:44:54,784
Connect to the to

2235
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:55,552
Throw it

2236
01:44:55,808 --> 01:44:58,368
Through the window of your nearest neighbor

2237
01:44:58,624 --> 01:45:00,160
And they will download the podcast

2238
01:45:00,416 --> 01:45:02,208
Cast for you I promise you that is how it works

2239
01:45:03,232 --> 01:45:09,376
No but you could go to that's definitely do the trick so I guess

2240
01:45:09,632 --> 01:45:15,008
As far as I know that baby who's crying in the background of some of the favorite just get sermon

2241
01:45:15,264 --> 01:45:18,336
I don't think that baby

2242
01:45:18,592 --> 01:45:21,152
