Alexandra Thurston color

3
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:16,640
A little bit about Alex Jones good cameras looking great

4
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:18,176
Even though it got knocked over twice

5
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,136

Filter we got Indian River Grapefruit

10
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:45,312
Don't know what that means

11
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:48,384
More weird flavors now

12
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:51,712
Why do they grow grapefruit

13
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:54,016
Doesn't matter to me at all I care about is

14
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:54,784

00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,984
Water that went bad like I don't even know how water can go bad

19
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,056
There is an expiration date on most bottled waters you should know that

20
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,128
My God that's delicious

21
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:21,664

00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:46,240
Right

29
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:53,408

Oregon Trail

43
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:53,312
Computers everyone play Mavis Beacon teaches typing I went number-crunching

44

Did you play Sopwith

46
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:02,272

47
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,832
Early Mac games

48
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:06,112
What's the weather

49
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:09,184
Event today

50
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:11,232
Alex Jones is once

51
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,512
Again on vacation

52
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:16,608
Okay

53
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,656
Alex Jones is once again on vacation

54
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:23,520
The

55
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:29,920
He's started naturalnews.com that puts out a bunch of real bad misinformation of

56
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:33,248
But Health you also swear

57
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:40,160
Basically Gucci already wrote for them for a really long time and then would use

58
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:42,464
Stuff you'd written on

59
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,000
Naturalnews.com

60
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:46,560
To be a story on Infowars it's a very

61
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:50,400
Incestuous Loop that they have going on

62
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:52,960
Would be like I assume anti-vaccine stuff

63
00:03:54,752 --> 00:04:00,384
You got like acai berry will cure you of everything I don't know I assume it's in League with that

64
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,664
Answer the

65
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,456
The same sort of homeopathic nonsense

66
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:06,528
You trying to work

67
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:08,064
Nothing

68
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,880
Don't

69
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:13,440
Cichlid

70
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:24,959
It's the noise has gone down a bit for the below

71
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:29,823
The thing is like that for a long time Mike Adams was Alex Jones

72
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:30,591
Does number 2

73
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,639
He was the guy who Alex

74
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:34,943
Forget to fill in for him anytime he was gone

75
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,247
I did not know that

76
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:40,831
Or around there all the time

77
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:43,391
Years since he's failed

78
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:49,023
I don't think so I think he just didn't need them cuz David night in house

79
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:54,399
It seems especially don't because

80
00:04:54,655 --> 00:05:00,287
We have the most boring guy in the history of the falling out but I think

81
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:02,335
It's more an issue of like

82
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:03,871
Brokeback

83
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:07,967
Anything is possible but I think the fact that he's coming back into

84
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:09,503
To the fold now it's kind of telling

85
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,039
Needs a steady

86
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:13,855
Yeah somebody can trust a real man

87
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:16,671
Cuz Mike Adams is much more of a man

88
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,487
David

89
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:23,583
Your soft youngin in the form of Owen Shroyer Milo yiannopoulos

90
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,119
Is a dishy gay man

91
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:28,447
So you pick it like you.

92
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,471
I'm sort of Alex

93
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:31,263
Replacement Mike Adams

94
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,311
Doesn't necessarily get freaked out

95
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,335
Scream all the time

96
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:36,383
He's more in line with that

97
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,919
What the audience wants to

98
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:40,479
50 out of masculinity

99
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:44,831
Coming out of retirement for one last job

100
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,623
So I assume at the end of this

101
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,415
Mike Adams goes down for

102
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,695
All of the crimes Alex

103
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:56,863
If This Were a funny movie Yes 2008

104
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,143
Sometimes Alex Jones

105
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,423
Comes back from break with

106
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,727
Panther theme song

107
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:02,495
Things like

108
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:05,311
You are Clouseau

109
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,847
Except

110
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,895
Cuso is like

111
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:11,199
He gets the job done

112
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,991
I don't know anyway it just

113
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:19,135
Fun thought I have a lot more thoughts about 2008 to go get into another church

114
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:19,903
The beginning

115
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:20,927
Tea Party Movement

116
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,719
Through the prism of Alex Jones

117
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:24,767
Which will be my next

118
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,399
The new one

119
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:33,727
Investigation

120
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,519
Party

121
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:38,335
Iraq

122
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:41,663
Start

123
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,943
A spoiler alert

124
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,503
No-scope Brothers

125
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,551
Did he claim to

126
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:52,159
Highfalutin ideas

127
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,231
Confederate

128
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:57,023
So we got that to look forward to get the

129
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,303
2008 investigation

130
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:00,607
Some stuff that will be coming down the pipe

131
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:06,751
Also The Gnome Chomsky interview will be coming up soon

132
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:08,031
For today for today

133
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,847
What is her today if ever want to break

134
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:17,503
Valero stock

135
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,039
But

136
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:21,087
Project Camelot been really disappointing lately

137
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,111
Haha

138
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,135
So

139
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,415
I guess there's nothing like

140
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:26,719
All the episodes are like

141
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,023
There's nothing to work with you

142
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,559
So Project Camelot is out

143
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:31,583
Into what I

144
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,351
Like okay

145
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,119
You know what else

146
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,143
Alex Jones

147
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,703
Has frequently been a guest on Coast to Coast AM

148
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:37,727
Maybe

149
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:42,591
Maybe I go find an episode of Coast to Coast AM with George Noory to talk about

150
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:47,967
San Francisco and interviewed Mark Richards on your own

151
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,319
Alright though I was listening to these episodes

152
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:54,111
The coast to coast analysis really boring

153
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,391
Because you respect George Noory

154
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,159
So much

155
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:59,231
So it's mostly just him saying I don't understand

156
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:05,631
He keeps telling George Noory the he's the Sam Adams of the second American Revolution

157
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:12,799
He doesn't he doesn't scream at all in the most salacious thing I was able to find was that

158
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:16,383
He just basically lies to George Noory space about

159
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,663
Your wife

160
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,199
Like that

161
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,527
Because George Noory that you need to

162
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:24,063
Clean up the record about

163
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,087
Your position on

164
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,159
Yeah yeah

165
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,071
Sound like

166
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,095
We got to find some

167
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:36,863
Something good

168
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,655
Then I remembered

169
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:41,727
2016 election

170
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:44,543
I like

171
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,335
It's like there's a lot of

172
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,103
Content

173
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,127
From that election

174
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,687
And we could dig into that would make for a great episode

175
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,991
It's always like I know the audience

176
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:53,759
Really want

177
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,039
To do an episode

178
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,319
About Alexa

179
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,367
This is the night

180
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:03,231
Cookout

181
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:04,767
To make this podcast

182
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:11,167
Because you were so disgusted with you man and I'm not ready to reopen that can of worms

183
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:16,799
We need absolutely unhealthy for the show to be at a point where

184
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:21,919
Like we're making millions office at backup

185
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:25,503
Either that or we need to go to couples therapy to survive view open

186
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,783
Uptogether

187
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,831
But then I started to think about it

188
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,111
And I remembered

189
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,135
A really fun

190
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,439
On the way to the election

191
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:37,023
And that is what we will be covering today

192
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,047
The time

193
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,071
The Julian Assange

194
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,863
How they 3 a.m. Prescott

And Alex Jones covered it live

196
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:43,935
Okay

197
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,727
So to give you a little bit of Kant

198
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:49,055
Julian Assange held a press conference

199
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:52,383
At 3 in the morning that was I understood that

200
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,431
Alex Jones cover device

201
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,527
You are

202
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,295
The most

203
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:01,599
Clarify

204
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:03,647
This is going to be anything about this

205
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:09,279
Know if you know anything about Alex's response

206
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:12,351
Oh my God you're going to have so much fun

207
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,119
Just to set the scene

208
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:15,423
204

209
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,775
Coverage of WikiLeaks from Germany

210
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,079
55 minutes away

211
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,615
Who got it

212
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,407
2 something in the morning

213
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,175
Alex Jones

214
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,199
Live in studio

215
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,735
I wait

216
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,527
I thought he was

217
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:31,807
What are you talkin about

218
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:39,743
Was this pre-recorded send these letters

219
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:42,559
Will be alive then also he's throwing it to break

220
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:48,447
We're going to be live coverage an hour early

221
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,215
That's

222
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,495
He started it

223
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,287
Very early

224
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:56,127
No I feel like you could have started that Joe

225
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:02,015
What could you possibly have to say for an hour before Julian Assange

226
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,807
Know what was happening

227
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,087
Is the

228
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:11,487
Started I started to remember this

229
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:13,023
I have mentioned this

230
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,095
Okay and I think I played a couple clips from

231
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,119
The end

232
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,911
But not the journey

233
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:21,471
Okay so well this might be reminiscing

234
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:27,359
Sent to some listeners of something we've talked about before it because they have a much better memory than you

235
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:30,687
Alex Jones

236
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,455
In the morning

237
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:34,015
Is going to be very much worth

238
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:38,367
He was like he's going to be live you will always be

239
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:40,927
Baby alive that's pink

240
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:44,511
Birthday was the one word Julian Assange

241
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,559
Okay

242
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:52,447
We just take the ride of Alex Jones being so very excited

243
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,007
To just dying on the inside of Earth

244
00:11:55,775 --> 00:12:01,919
Did I give up the game fun to watch believes it to be

245
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:04,479
The day that Hillary Clinton is destroyed

246
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:07,039
Julian Assange

247
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:10,879
Is just giving a 10th anniversary press conference for wickedly

248
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:17,535
What's going on

249
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:23,935
Built it up in his head to be the day that he releases all of the information about Hillary

250
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:26,495
And the reason is revealed in this

251
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,055
Ladies and gentlemen

252
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,335
I'm Alex Jones

253
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:36,479
Yeah you are

254
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:40,575
308

255
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:47,231
Eastern time for the grand we're going to be live here until the WikiLeaks

256
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,023
Has come and gone

257
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:03,615
The last weekend

258
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:06,943
Ashanti net worth

259
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,223
Joseph

260
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,271
Alex

261
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:14,879
Assange has always been very judicious releases things

262
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,159
Natural

263
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:26,399
Flash 5 or so because

264
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:31,775
The very same stuff Bush does Willy go after them as well and they do

265
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:34,847
Will they hurt the people I want them to hurt

266
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,127
That's basically that

267
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,919
But hey

268
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:39,967
Troubling

269
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:46,879
Cuz he said that Rodger Stone said Rodger Stones been committing crimes for a long time now and

270
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:52,511
So we know for sure that he's a crime comiter break right now when he's trying to build this up

271
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:55,071
I'd like this is going to be the good

272
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,935
He has to bolster Rodger Stones credibility and he knows he's talked to him

273
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:00,959
Now he's like

274
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:04,543
Ha you ever say that

275
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:10,943
You stupid assholes both because if he just admitted that he was lying about it then

276
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:11,711
Travel

277
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:16,575
Also we know he's not lying about it because didn't Rodger Stone say it at the time or less

278
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:20,671
Like I don't

279
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:23,231
I don't necessarily know what is what

280
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,511
But if I had to guess

281
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,047
I would say 104

282
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:26,815
Rodger

283
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:27,583
Coolchems

284
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,631
Whether or not

285
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:34,239
Like trying to make himself or whatever the reality is

286
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:40,383
Rodger told him I've spoken to Julian Assange the more I learn about Rodger

287
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,431
Just as evil as he is

288
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:44,479
He is such chaotic

289
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:47,295
Cable that there's kind of a

290
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:51,647
He's doing all the wrong stuff but at the same time it's just like

291
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:52,927
Nearest scale

292
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,975
No cuz parent evil

293
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:56,767
Rodger

294
00:14:57,023 --> 00:15:03,167
Ratfuck people he's wrapped f****** Alex like if you do wave this

295
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:06,495

So in this next clip Alex is

299
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:25,951
You know it's a late-night broadcast

300
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,231
But

301
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,023
You still got to get some

That would be

309
00:15:55,647 --> 00:16:01,023
Actually

310
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,047
I'll have you arrested

311
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:09,215
Dot-com

312
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:10,495
Good for you for reporting

313
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:12,287
Load of horseshit

314
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:16,639
The story

315
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:23,295
So there is a journey Williams

316
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:28,927
Can Post article about why this is a load of s***

317
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:33,023
So are on January 9th 1999

318
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,047
Scoop about Bill

319
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,071
The president

320
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,351
It turned out was not

321
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:38,655
The father of a boy born to a former prostitute

322
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:39,423
Dude in Arkansas

323
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:42,239
Okay here earlier it has been drugged who broke

324
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,007
The story of Clinton

325
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,799
The fair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky

326
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:46,335
Drudge's credibility with

327
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:48,127
I wasn't about to

328
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,919
Throw it away on some wild claim

329
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,223
But a love child but it just been debunked

330
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:52,991
DNA test

331
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:58,367
Yes 17 years later as Insight relentlessly promotes the political ambitions

332
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,135
Donald Trump

333
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:01,439
And fuel conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton

334
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,463
Judges decided

335
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,743
To propagate the idea that

336
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:04,767
Perhaps this boy

337
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:07,071
Now a thirty-year-old man named Williams

338
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:07,839
Is Bill

339
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:08,863
Sun after all

340
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,143
In the past two weeks

341
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,167
Articles about William

342
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:16,287
Last Wednesday afternoon the website when

343
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,567
Quasi

344
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,615
Droste effect

345
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:21,663
Posting a picture of William standing

346
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,711
Text with screen displaying an image of himself

347
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:26,015
It appeared in another drudgereport Banner earlier the day

348
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:27,807
So you know

349
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:28,575
You're not going on here

350
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:32,415
That's so weird imagine what the

351
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,695
Before we editorialize

352
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,279
Interested Williams

353
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,071
Things with certainty that

354
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,375
By suggesting that information is

355
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:44,191
This is a grotesque twisting of History

356
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:45,727
It's based on a report

357
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,263
From WorldNetDaily

358
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,567
No blood sample was obtained from

359
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:52,127
This supposedly shocking revelation

360
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:54,431
From the former editor of Star Magazine

361
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,199
Bill Bunton

362
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:57,503
Poseidon 1999

363
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,783
DNA testing

364
00:17:59,039 --> 00:17:59,807
Included the williamses

365
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:00,831
Chocolate and son

366
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,879
George learned of a negative result

367
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:04,671
And publish the news before star or anyone

368
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:07,999
But if but now admits that he never got a blunt

369
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:10,559
Franklin there must never have been a real test

370
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:11,583
Georgia saying

371
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:12,607
Which means Williams

372
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:13,631
Could be legit

373
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,167
In reality

374
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,703
The Tabloid never claimed to him

375
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,471
Tainted blood sample

376
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,263
It didn't need one

377
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:23,103
Because a partial analysis of Clinton the blood was available in the public record thanks.

378
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,127
Mechanic Stars investigate

379
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,407
Lewinsky affair

380
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:30,527
Right so it is neither knew nor relevant to Star Magazine did not possess a vial of Clinton's blood

381
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,367
The Tabloid needed only a sample of Williams bloodwitch Williams provided

382
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,391
Compare Clinton

383
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,183
Available genetic markers

384
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,463
So

385
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:41,279
From what I understand

386
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:42,559
Because

387
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:45,631
Kmart address

388
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,983
And then lied about it and then it was discovered it

389
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,263
Is true

390
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,543
Then invalidate

391
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,359
The other conspiracy theory

392
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:59,711
Go to the original content because the DNA

393
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,575
Actors that became clear that like

394
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,879
The blood test

395
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:08,159
The story change

396
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:10,719
Amy playing became that

397
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:11,487
The only

398
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:12,255
We had Clinton

399
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,303
Your toy

400
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,351
From the Star investigation

401
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,887
Not be more specific

402
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:19,679
Rflp test

403
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:24,543
Which is however

404
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,311
So

405
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:26,847
They're really take

406
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:27,615
Things out of car

407
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:30,943
PCR test

408
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:31,967
Which is what you cook

409
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:32,991
Do with

410
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:33,759
Clinton

411
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:35,807
Public records

412
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:39,391
As a potential father

413
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,719
Prove

414
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:45,791
The potential father

415
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:48,607
You can exclude him from the potential

416
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:49,631
Pool with people

417
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:51,679
Falco

418
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,471
So judge knew what he was doing

419
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:58,335
Tattoo

420
00:19:59,103 --> 00:19:59,615
Rodger Stone

421
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:02,175
I put out

422
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:08,575
So it all around this world

423
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:13,695
Discord and hatred ever he goes yeah

424
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:16,511
In terms of propaganda especially Auntie Clinton

425
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:18,559
Some stuff Rodger stone is Rome

426
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:21,119
Dell Road

427
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,935
He's got his hand in every one of these little pies

428
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:25,215
It is not

429
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:27,263
The more I think about it the more

430
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,543
It's kind of like

431
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,591
If you are anybody in Ark

432
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:32,127
That was

433
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:34,687
Born around a certain time

434
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:35,967
And you were just like

435
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:37,759
I think I'm Clinton's biologic

436
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:38,527
Michael Kidd

437
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:44,927
You right-wing news would almost certainly pick it up an amplifier

438
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:45,695
Same effect

439
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:46,463
Probably

440
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:48,255
True now of

441
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,023
Claims against

442
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:49,791
Trump

443
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:54,399
Unfortunately probably is but unfortunately there are a lot of very

444
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:56,447
I don't think I don't think any of the claims

445
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:58,239
That'll be made publicly are

446
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:04,639
I also do believe that

447
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:05,919
Who was full of s***

448
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,455
People would jump on it

449
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:13,087
Right I think the difference between

450
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:20,512
Opportunistic left-leaning blogs

451
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:21,536
Probably would

452
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,328
So I guess that's the

453
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,096
The differentiate

454
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,888
I don't know we're talkin about

455
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,216
Trump's kid

456
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:34,848
At the begin true thing you heard it here first I am Jordan

457
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:35,616
Beat Trump

458
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:37,408
But that's me

459
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,736
The clear that

460
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,272
Hey you know what

461
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:44,064
This this press conference

462
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:45,088
In a f****** happen

463
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,368
After it happened

464
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,392
The media

465
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,672
The mainstream media

466
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:50,208
They're going to lie about what have

467
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:54,560
They all just lockstep

468
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,424
They come out and spew their disinformation all loaded on teleprompter

469
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:03,008
Unify themselves next 45 hours

470
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:07,872
Northwood

471
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:12,992
WikiLeaks

472
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:20,928
Embassy 14

473
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:22,976
Ecuadorian

474
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:30,400
Flowers in Germany

475
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:33,472
Archway press conference

476
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,800
Arch

477
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:40,896
Paraguay

478
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:50,368
Now it's clear and start of approximately

479
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,392
40

480
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:53,184
7 minutes and change

481
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:55,744
So you got 47 minutes left

482
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:56,768
Before Julian

483
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:57,536
Massages

484
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:59,072
Press conference start

485
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:01,376
And then there's another bit of time

486
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,656
Before Julian Assange

487
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:03,680
Himself

488
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:04,704
Choose state

489
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:06,752
This is bad planning on Alex

490
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,032
Ian

491
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:09,056
Clearly

492
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:14,688
I want to see this

493
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:18,528
I know we throw that around a lot

494
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:22,368
I think he's straight-up guarantee this is just him being like

495
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,904
I tried to get an app

496
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,720
In between the early shower now and I didn't get as much

497
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:33,120
Flavors that would like so I'm a little bit off don't know what time zone I'm in right now I think there's definitely

498
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:34,656
A difference

499
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:36,704
You can tell I think it's important to call it out

500
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:40,544
Princeville

501
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:45,664
Very drug

502
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,456
We can go along

503
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:49,504
I allow that is a possibility

504
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:53,344
Okay I'll allow it is a possibility that once the worm turns

505
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,160
He starts

506
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:58,208
This is not drunk

507
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,768
It's very tired but also

508
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,816
Pretty excited

509
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:08,960
And then what you think

510
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:15,616
It better be bombshell because they certainly what are appetite

511
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:18,944
I mean I've got my fingers crossed

512
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:24,064
Because they're attacking or

513
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:28,672
Because he's killustrated somehow rigged this whole thing is

514
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,768
So just real quick

515
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:33,792
At this point

516
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:35,072
Owen Shroyer

517
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:37,376
Is turned off

518
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:41,472
Quiet right now

519
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:43,776
Owen Shroyer is talking

520
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:47,104
Can you get to see his lips moving but there's nobody was looking at the video like

521
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:48,384
Anyway

522
00:24:57,344 --> 00:25:02,720
Sure. We're not going to criticize anybody else

523
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:07,072
Specific reason hold on to it for the end of the show

524
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:10,400
There's a big we're going to go for

525
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,032
And you know he's making a big deal out of

526
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,312
34 days

527
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:18,336
Tell the election

528
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:20,896
October

529
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:23,456
I remember when we were all so bright

530
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:25,504
Jung hoseok

531
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,552
When our only problem was

532
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:30,112
Will you know

533
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:33,696
Most of the same problems we have now but just like lesser version

534
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:36,768
Also this really funny this video is still up on Alex Jones at

535
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:39,840
Channel here's the

536
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:41,888
About in the air YouTube

537
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:48,032
Four screw at 2 a.m. Central on Tuesday October 4th for a live broadcast

538
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:49,824
As Wikileaks releases at

539
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,104
October surprise

540
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,432
They could swing the election against Hillary if it catches fire

541
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:56,224
They're selling it

542
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,064
And the graphic that they have for it is just a picture of Julian Assange

543
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,624
Wikileaks October surprise

544
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,696
So Alex is awesome

545
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:06,976
Did Rodger told him

546
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,768
Rodger told him

547
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:10,048
Don't worry about it

548
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:11,840
This is the big time

549
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:12,864
Absolutely

550
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,656
So here's what

551
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:17,216
Owen finally gets his mic

552
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,288
Go ahead

553
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:26,176
It'll be interesting to see what the response is because with a lot of these Wikileaks it's nothing that really shocked us

554
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:28,992
It's nothing that you couldn't

555
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:35,392
So the question is will the end this is what the sign said in interviews that he did

556
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:42,048
Or will they try to spin something off tomorrow will be

557
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:48,448
You know a white cop that shoots a black guy so they want to run that story all day long tomorrow

558
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:50,240
See what the reaction is

559
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:52,288
From the American citizen

560
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:56,896
And from the world I mean the world

561
00:26:57,152 --> 00:27:01,504
Everybody everybody

562
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,600
That sign saying this bombshell is going to be significant

563
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:07,648
So in the lead-up to this

564
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,952
You was talking big game

565
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:16,608
About how like Hillary was going to get

566
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:18,144
Information on her and all that stuff

567
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:20,704
But he never said that this play

568
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,472
Press conference

569
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:23,008
Was going to be when he released it

570
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,336
That never that deal was never part of his rhetoric

571
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:28,128
This is them conflating

572
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:30,176
They don't understand

573
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:37,600
Will clearly over the reveal that this is a disappointment

574
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:39,392
Hope you'll like terrible

575
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:41,696
Dancing around that but like

576
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:45,280
Fascinating to me how little they understand about the

577
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:46,816
Things that they see and read

578
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:49,376
Right but almost

579
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:50,912
Like if I recall correctly

580
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:55,520
He wasn't exactly disabusing people of the notion that it might be the time

581
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:57,056
This is all that information

582
00:27:57,312 --> 00:28:03,456
I don't know like I know all the things he said

583
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:06,784
Absolutely but as I recall a 100

584
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:10,112
I'm sure cuz I don't follow everything the man says

585
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:12,928
But I think that a lot of the stuff he was saying when people were

586
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:14,720
Floating these sorts of ideas

587
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:15,488
This is when it's

588
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:16,256
Going to happen

589
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:18,560
We're along the lines of like we don't release

590
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:19,584
We don't talk about

591
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,608
Contact that we released

592
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:21,376
Until it's released

593
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:23,936
Or things like

594
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:29,824
You know basically the same flavor is None Shall know the day of the Lord's return

595
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,384
He comes like a thief in the night which by the way

596
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:33,664
Next one

597
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:35,456
In case anybody was wondering

598
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:36,992
I got some information

599
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:39,552
Pre-trib Rapture is actually true

600
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:41,088
I know you're just joking but what is that

601
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:44,672
Debbie crazy

602
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:50,048
Jordan

603
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:56,448
Can you f****** ruined it for everybody ruin your camera camera

604
00:28:58,752 --> 00:28:59,520
Like all of God's

605
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:01,824
The plans were thwarted by

606
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:05,152
5 hours

607
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:08,992
So in this next clip

608
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,296
Donald Trump but he says something

609
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:13,600
In this next clip

610
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:14,368
That shouldn't

611
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,952
It really take what you think it sounds like

612
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:23,328
60 years of work

613
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,912
World government

614
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,056
People their constitutional

615
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:41,504
Run the boat Norwall

616
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,880
But he's going to get the boat out

617
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:48,416
That's not

618
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:51,488
That's not the

619
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:57,120
What getting out of the it's not so important that we get out of the dock we're like

620
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:58,400
Crashed

621
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:03,264
I mean we're out of if you extended metaphor

622
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,568
Real dangerous territory what's he like

623
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:11,968
Destroy the country

624
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,504
Forgot to roll them bones

625
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,856
I say we don't let it ride

626
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:18,624
I say we do

627
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:21,184
And also I would I would argue that

628
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:22,464
The metaphor of the

629
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,488
The country being a boat

630
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:24,768
It's tied up at a dock

631
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:33,984
Does not

632
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:39,872
Alex is right in that the government that we have now

633
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:42,176
Was designed to make us all poor

634
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:45,504
He just doesn't understand that the government we have currently

635
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:47,808
Designs to make

636
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:49,088
Everything

637
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:50,880
Collapse except for

638
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:51,648
The interest

639
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:52,416
The very

640
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,512
Which will of course collapse eventually but they'll have castles

641
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,048
It's like a

642
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,072
It's like going

643
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,864
Who cares I do to extend

644
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:01,888
Does metaphor anytime

645
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:04,960
Send a text

646
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:06,240
Ray having a race

647
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:10,848
The Harvard what are those what are those called like the boat

648
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:13,408
Gatlin

649
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,688
Nope no

650
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:18,784
Boat races

651
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,856
Raspberry and cranberry

652
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:28,768
Cranberry the Cape Cod cranberry is a winner also to put this up on the screen it's look at this here at the

653
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:30,048
Bottom it just says beer

654
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:37,984
Justice beer on the bottom of the

655
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,776
Don't go grapefruit

656
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,080
Is go green after red

657
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:43,104
Okay we go lie

658
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:46,688
Where's the flying from

659
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:51,040
Here we go with his next clip so Alex Jones really pump

660
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:52,320
For whatever is going to come

661
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:53,088
From Nissan

662
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:54,368
Revelation

663
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:59,488
That's a good question was

664
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,560
No he's not he's in

665
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:08,704
He's a big deal

666
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,008
Can just be

667
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:12,544
Suggesting that

668
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,336
The f****** globalists are going to

669
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,360
False flag

670
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:17,408
Shoot a black guy with a white cop

671
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:22,528
To cover up the story

672
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,832
Here we find out that more of that more

673
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:28,416
And if the thing that worries me though is

674
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:29,184
This is Darren

675
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:29,952
Aquamarine

676
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:32,000
Is just how

677
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:36,352
Literally cannot win

678
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:41,472
Just about a lot of the Hillary supporters that are already out there cuz I mean she gets away

679
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:47,360
With everything are we going to lose this going to be worse than I mean

680
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:48,896
Will this be worse than

681
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:53,248
Fauci Badgers women in

682
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:58,880
They're about to announce

683
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:03,232
Emails confirming

684
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,048
1

685
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:12,960
Illegal memes

686
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:17,824
Confirm that she's been plotting to kill Assange

687
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:24,480
I think also

688
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:26,528
Email the shipments of weapons

689
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,344
Antarctica

690
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:38,048
Directing the media word-for-word what to say

691
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:47,008
What do

692
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,872
It's going to be

693
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:53,920
Lester Holt

694
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:58,784
The actual

695
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:01,088
Also

696
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:03,392
It's going to be

697
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:08,512
Other armed ship into

698
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:09,280
Why not

699
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:16,448
The EU officials with NATO and the UN being directed by the state department to prepare The Collector

700
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:22,848
The lot into this one brush cutter

701
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:24,640
Keep in mind

702
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:26,176
Alex said

703
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:31,808
This is my prediction it's going to be

704
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:35,648
Everything that verifies all of my narrative

705
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:36,416
Yep

706
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:37,184
That's

707
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:42,816
I mean it's tough to get away from how like

708
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:43,584
Invested

709
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:47,424
That sounds you know like that's that's a very unhealthy level of

710
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,728
Yeah but what I say

711
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:52,288
I think he's really doing is putting

712
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:55,616
All of his narratives in there

713
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:58,432
Approved any of them to be like well

714
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:03,040
We didn't see this stuff approved but I still got one right the rest of its,

715
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:06,880
Exact yeah you're probably right needs to get one

716
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:08,160
Yeah

717
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:09,696
No sniper

718
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:11,744
No no no sniper activity

719
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,096
Just just a shotgun full of rock salt come out

720
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,704
Soon as we get some more prediction

721
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:24,032
I believe it's going to be

722
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:26,336
The Hillandale Stephen Morris coming out

723
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:27,616
Before the election

724
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:30,432
I just watching out what's on those things

725
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,064
Well he's pretty much stated that as well as he said he was he's got a

726
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:38,880
A treasure Trove of information that he's going to release

727
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:39,904
Set a time

728
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:44,000
You know so we're going to probably see

729
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:45,024
Once a week

730
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,304
Something like this

731
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,608
But I think the big ones tonight

732
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:54,752
Both of you are what I was so hot

733
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:58,336
Finish my Words I was stumbling over my next word

734
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:00,896
But this year

735
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:03,456
Guilt

736
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:04,736
It's responsibility

737
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:07,808
Ijump hours

738
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,880
Yeah it sounds like a good

739
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:17,536
Why does my soul

740
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:20,608
Never felt so good working this hard

741
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:21,888
This is history

742
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:23,424
History

743
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:25,216
So pumped

744
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:27,264
They are so they are like

745
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:29,824
This is the vindication

746
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:31,104
Because they

747
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:37,504
Never been right about everything before I get one

748
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,528
And Rodger has

749
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:43,648
Weirdly told that your boat is coming in

750
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:45,184
Jimmy's going to break

751
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,232
F****** you know what it is

752
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:49,792
It's Dee it's like a kid

753
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:50,560
On Christmas

754
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:53,120
Like a PlayStation

755
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:59,520
And it's real and they're so sure

756
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:05,920
Sure of it and then they get disappointed on Christmas

757
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:06,688
F*** with Eric

758
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:10,528
Because their older brother

759
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:13,600
Rodger Stone in this metaphor

760
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,160
Finally time that you're getting the PlayStation

761
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:23,584
Even though he's probably already being inside the Box

762
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:27,936
This going to be hilarious we're going to talk with themselves to be so great

763
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:28,704

00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,520
Send a text with Alex explains that he's the real

765

766
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:33,824
Because you stayed up late

767
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:37,920
Media

768
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:40,736

Live coverage

I wouldn't care if they were telling the truth

772
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:48,416
It's cnnr

773
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:50,720

Text Cliff just to move up Mulan

776
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:56,864
Other West Indies lime

780
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:20,928
I don't even know if that's the name of the company

781
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:23,744
This is actually us finding out at 30 B

782
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,512
Zima is

783
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:27,072
Great you know what I never disagreed with

784
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:29,888
Even when I was younger man I didn't have one of those sort of an

785
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,704
I didn't like I didn't like us

786
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,472
Smirnoff Ice

787
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:39,616
I know it looks bloated

788
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:45,248
This is like if the shity water you bought earlier was actually delicious go down the road of my history with wine

789
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:47,296
Coolers

790
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:49,600
It's going to be a long podcast if you do

791
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:53,952
Instead I would like to submit to you this next clip

792
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:55,744
It just confirms that Alex Jones

793
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:56,768
Is

794
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:58,048
Fully saying

795
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:59,328
Their October

796
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:02,400
You're watching live coverage

797
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,032
Eastern

798
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:09,312
The WikiLeaks

799
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:12,128
October surprise that kicks off

800
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:13,408
In about 7

801
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:16,480
The October surprise baby

802
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:18,016
The kicks off in 7 minutes

803
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:19,552
Isn't this

804
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:20,832
Isn't it almost

805
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:24,416
Very similar to the time. We're done

806
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:27,488
Junior was

807
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:28,768
Text it was on

808
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:33,632
Twitter with those people illegally I wish I'd figured out the timeline before we did this

809
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:34,912
Probably

810
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:39,008
Didn't he say like especially this would be great especially in the

811
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:41,056
Or was it in the summer

812
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:47,456
No the one

813
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:49,248
The direct message

814
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:53,088
About somebody who gave him who's going to give him

815
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:56,160
Secret information or whatever

816
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:58,208
Email for

817
00:39:58,464 --> 00:39:58,976
Amara

818
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:00,256
Right right right

819
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:01,792
Let me look that up

820
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:03,840
Advance

821
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:12,032
If I'm going to well I will be

822
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:14,336
Fair enough

823
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:25,088
What is going to be there

824
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,648
I'm just going to lay out grievances

825
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:28,928
That's all it's going to be

826
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,488
I'm going to lock the doors and I'm just going to be like

827
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:32,512
Listen up

828
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:38,912
Here's all the s*** that my parents did wrong and I'm saying this publicly we need to have an intervention religion

829
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,216
Cool it was months

830
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:43,008
Before the meeting was in

831
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:44,288
June

832
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,312
There's a

833
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,384
Gmail

834
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,480
Number for that exactly

835
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:53,760
What was going on

836
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:56,320
Clandestinely

837
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:59,392
Empty at this point in October

838
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:00,672
That's what we got there

839
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:03,488
Alex says we have 7 minutes

840
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:04,512
Let's tell it start

841
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:12,448
Journalists who are giving a bit of a lecture about the history of Wicca

842
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,728
Because

843
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:15,264
Anniversary

844
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:18,848
Until they're giving that it did

845
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:19,872
You know given

846
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:21,152
Chelsea Manning

847
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:23,200
A hero

848
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:24,736
This is very important

849
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:31,648
Pretty much everything since then has been b******* you know what I don't have a clip of this but this is actually the only time that Alex Jones didn't

850
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:32,416
Misgender her

851
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:35,232
Really actually called her Chelsea

852
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:37,536
See on this episode

853
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:39,840
Nora Bradley Manning

854
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:41,632
Wow

855
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:43,936
Actually

856
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:45,472
He has adopted the naming

857
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:47,008
In convention he does say Chelsea

858
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:48,544
Generally speaking

859
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,824
Now but also

860
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:50,592
Misgender

861
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:52,640
But in this case

862
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:55,711
Really cool with that brings up

863
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:56,991
Brings up how

864
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:58,015
It's on tubing like

865
00:41:58,271 --> 00:42:00,063
Like I will go to prison if you release her

866
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:03,135
Pronoun

867
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:04,415
It's very weird but I think it's

868
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:05,183
The secondary

869
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:11,583
Enough so that he

870
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:13,119
Finally isn't

871
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:20,543
So

872
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:26,175
Exactly

873
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:28,479
To be prejudiced against everybody

874
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:30,271
Different italics

875
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:31,551
Complaining about how like

876
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:33,855
Have to keep up with these new terms

877
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:35,903
Introduces new term

878
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:41,791
It's not that hard but I can understand how it would be tough for a bigot to be like

879
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:42,815
Where

880
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:44,095
Why do I have to have

881
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:45,119
Finding new tires

882
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:50,239
Why do I have to keep finding new rationalization for hating people who are different

883
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:53,567
Why are there so many ways people can be different

884
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:55,615
That's got to be exhausted

885
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:59,455
Press conference start

886
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:01,247
With these people giving a history of WikiLeaks

887
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:02,527
Yes

888
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:03,295
I don't

889
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:04,319
Knew that was going to

890
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:05,087
What happened

891
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:07,903
He just said it was going to be full-on

892
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:09,695
Julian comes out in his life

893
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:16,607
Instead

894
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:17,375
If this

895
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:18,655
No

896
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:21,727
10 years ago we started this website

897
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:24,287
You know and he doesn't really know how to do

898
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:25,823
Plays it straight

899
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:27,871
Course heaven

900
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:31,199
Interesting editorial Vitale

901
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:32,479
Drop them

902
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:43,743
Thomas Jefferson was a liberal

903
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:45,279
Telling the truth being honorable

904
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:51,679
Obama and

905
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:57,823
Hillary Sanger totally alone the whole world must be shut down

906
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,639
Free Press

907
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:01,919
So

908
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:03,455
There's a real liberals

909
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:04,479
School

910
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:05,247
Imallexx

911
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:06,527
2 super into it

912
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:07,807
You still

913
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:09,855
The Patriot

914
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:12,159
Absolutely

915
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:15,487
What is a real

916
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:18,815
What does that even mean

917
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:22,143
Thomas Jefferson Thomas Jefferson was a real American

918
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:26,239
The true are you create a new

919
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:28,287
Then he gets to adopt

920
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:32,639
Founder of our country

921
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:35,967
He could claim videos

922
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:37,759
European

923
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:39,039
This is a guy

924
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:40,831
From where

925
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:49,023
That's where I got it.

926
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:50,047
He's British

927
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:51,839
Australian

928
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:54,399
Where is he from

929
00:44:54,655 --> 00:45:00,287
Paraguay Uruguay as the reality

930
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:06,943
Country of origin for the song I got us trailer from the chat room

931
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:11,295
Who committed a crime in Suite who's now in the UK and Ecuadorian Embassy

932
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:17,695
He's an Australian they come for my light of criminals I don't know why there's no reason

933
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:19,743
So does everybody from Georgia

934
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:20,767
My point here

935
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:21,535
Don't say that

936
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:27,167
The bunch of Australian Elizabeth is that you have a sister

937
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:29,727
Hoo-boy

938
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:30,751
Circuitous

939
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:34,847
Exactly put himself in the Ecuadorian Embassy

940
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:36,127
City of the UK

941
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:39,199
Great

942
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:42,527
We gets up

943
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:43,295
Considering

944
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:44,063
Nevermind

945
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:47,903
We get Darren mcbreen jumping back in I believe

946
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:48,671
We're talking about

947
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:50,463
Hardcore

948
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:51,487
Is going to be

949
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:53,535
Accusation

950
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:54,303
Dismayed about the

951
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:58,911
Here we are at 3:30 in the morning

952
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:00,703
Fabric

953
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:03,775
Hardcore

954
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:05,055
He's going to get along Hillary

955
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:10,687
Super hardcore you guys were talking earlier about how

956
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:15,039
Water time to go to these News website more information

957
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:23,487
Going a step further Hillary Clinton

958
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:25,791
Tina has a Troll Army

959
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:34,751
For these trolls to go to these news websites to go to infowars.com

960
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:36,287
Go to Facebook

961
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:41,151
And to argue with a course they are there pro-hillary

962
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:46,527
And they basically attack anybody who has anything to do at 8

963
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:51,391
So these are trolls

964
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:57,279
Well Darren is completely correct

965
00:46:58,559 --> 00:46:59,583
I don't think it look

966
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:02,143
I don't care what side you are on

967
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:03,935
For the most part

968
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:06,495
You do not have to pay people to be assholes on

969
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:10,079
Everybody does it for free

970
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:10,847
And you know what

971
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:16,735
Honestly I think it's if you're on one side of the political divide and you're getting abused a bunch

972
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:18,527
By people in comment section

973
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:20,575
I think it's actually a much

974
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:21,599
More comforting

975
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:22,879
Idea that

976
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:23,903
They're paid

977
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:26,207
Because

978
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:32,351
Because if not that means those people are doing it because

979
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:33,631
Their monsters

980
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:36,447
Text

981
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:39,007
When you look at the ideas like

982
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:40,031
Like

983
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:42,079
Take a picture of humanity it's like

984
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:43,871
Much rather

985
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:45,151
These bees dick

986
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:45,919
Posting all the

987
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:47,455
Violent angry

988
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:53,855
Otherwise everybody

989
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:59,743
Consider that they're just doing it because I feel this in my heart

990
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:01,279
Then like little boy

991
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:02,303
I'm in for

992
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:03,583
The rest of my life

993
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:04,863
Yeah there's really nothing

994
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:06,143
Can do outside of

995
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:08,703
Hopefully

996
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:09,471
Education

997
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:12,543
People don't like that

998
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:16,127
Specifically talking about David Brock

999
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:17,151
Correct the record

1000
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:18,687
Initiative

1001
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:20,991
Where they had a bunch of people who are going around

1002
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:22,527
How to find places where missing

1003
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:24,319
Information was being spread about

1004
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:25,087
Hillary Clinton

1005
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:28,671
Supposed to be explanation

1006
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:31,487
Idea of life

1007
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:34,815
And stuff like that of the reality

1008
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:37,375
Is very close to

1009
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:38,911
The version that Alex

1010
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:42,495
Texas people who work

1011
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:47,103
Did the version that Derek's

1012
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:48,895
Is conflating

1013
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:49,663
Probably

1014
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:54,271
Dumb people with the people who were paid

1015
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:55,551
There's probably like

1016
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:57,343
You'll never really be able to prove

1017
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:58,367
XYZ

1018
00:48:58,623 --> 00:49:01,183
The person on the internet was paid

1019
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:02,719
Then you can take the

1020
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:04,767
Behavior of someone who is awful

1021
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:07,071
And assume that's the same as prisoners like

1022
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:08,863
No actually hears them

1023
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:11,167
Here's an article about what really happened

1024
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:13,215
I don't know

1025
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:16,543
You're never going to win

1026
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:18,591
Because they are always react

1027
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:22,431
Yeah the only possibilities education in education is

1028
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:23,967
Really going to win because

1029
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:25,503
In order to be educated

1030
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:27,039
You have to admit that you

1031
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:28,063
You don't know that

1032
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:30,879
Publix

1033
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:32,159
You feel stupid

1034
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:34,207
And the people that we are fighting

1035
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:36,511
Against are essentially people who

1036
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:39,327
Refuse to admit that they don't know

1037
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:40,607
It's a threat

1038
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:43,679
It's a threat to your identity

1039
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:46,239
If you're a manly if you're like

1040
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:51,103
Didn't this male identity of always being the strongest

1041
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:53,919
To apply to the intellect

1042
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:54,687
Actual Spears

1043
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:57,759
Like I know

1044
00:49:59,295 --> 00:49:59,807
Packy

1045
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:01,087
Nike thing

1046
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:03,135
But I bet he won't

1047
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:03,903
Casper directions

1048
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:05,951
Like I bet

1049
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:07,487
NYU

1050
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:10,815
Why don't they make the plane out of whatever the black box

1051
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:14,399
I haven't lived with masculinity what does

1052
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:15,167
Does Mexico

1053
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:17,471
The next clip

1054
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:21,567
The manly as hell

1055
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:25,919
He doesn't do that he does a pro wrestler

1056
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:27,455
Style shoot

1057
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:30,015
Alright David Brock

1058
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:33,343
You know something I don't

1059
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:41,023
Airborne

1060
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:42,303
Fox News

1061
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:44,863
Calls you out MSNBC calls you out

1062
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,423
Doubt

1063
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:53,823
And you respond Hillary Clinton calls you out says you haven't darkheart you respond with and I never cover.

1064
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:54,591
Okay

1065
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:57,407
I called you a money laundering fee

1066
00:50:57,663 --> 00:51:01,247
David Brock noticed he won't where are you want to go there

1067
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:07,903
Is somebody is somebody said something that damning about myself about my personal record I think that I would

1068
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:10,719
Want to respond about your a lying and accurate

1069
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:11,487
Piece of s***

1070
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:13,023
Right

1071
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:15,839
I can't wait till calling you out

1072
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:18,399
If you want somebody

1073
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:23,007
Let me tell you something

1074
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:24,543
You work for a line

1075
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:26,847
Uline

1076
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:28,895
You think you're a bigot

1077
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:30,943
Even broken you don't even

1078
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:35,807
You're all so bad at your job

1079
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:37,343
This as a potential X

1080
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:38,111
Explanation

1081
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:39,903
Alex has something to

1082
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:42,719
Game from engaging and that is increased

1083
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:43,743
Exposure

1084
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:45,535
Anthony sells more of his dumb

1085
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:52,703
And David Brock doesn't have anything to gain by engaging

1086
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:55,519
David Brock engaging

1087
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:56,799
Exactly

1088
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:58,079
This whole thing is like

1089
00:51:59,103 --> 00:52:03,199
Is so desperate when you really look at it through like the lines of

1090
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:04,991
The real world

1091
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:06,783
I want to dignify you with a

1092
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:08,319
You're just trying to

1093
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:09,599
It's schoolyard show

1094
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:15,999
It's absolutely Boolean we're in something of

1095
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:17,023
The opposite position

1096
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:18,047
And insofar as

1097
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:19,583
We only have something

1098
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:20,351
To gain if

1099
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:22,143
Alex comes after

1100
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:23,935
He will then

1101
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:29,055
So Alex what I'm saying is you're a giant

1102
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:33,663
Write whole worldview is based on a

1103
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:37,247
Did the issue to it when it comes down to authentic

1104
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:38,015
Is that like

1105
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:40,575
I don't know if David Brock

1106
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:41,599
Is involved

1107
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:42,623
I have no idea

1108
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:45,183
But Owen Shroyer making Zack

1109
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:49,535
In order for it to be liable like proving it in court

1110
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:50,815
Is different

1111
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:53,887
In the same way is that like there's

1112
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:56,959
The way that our laws are written in

1113
00:52:57,215 --> 00:53:00,543
In terms of like slander and libel are the it's very difficult

1114
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:03,103
To prove the legal standard of those things

1115
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:03,871
To

1116
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:08,735
Speakwrite you would rather era

1117
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:13,087
Well they have to because that's their whole basically

1118
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:15,903
Literally all they do is as

1119
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:18,207
Is close to a libel law

1120
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:20,255
As they possibly can

1121
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:25,119
And satellite

1122
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:26,911
It's Not Over

1123
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:37,151
I'm accusing you of money laundering I think that you are an absolute

1124
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:39,711
Mccratic campaign donation funding

1125
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:44,831
You and Mary Bonner need to be audited and looked into by the IRS and probably put in jail

1126
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:51,231
Okay let's hear you respond to that I bet your darkheart as nuts look how he's a total moron he looks like

1127
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:57,631
Deluxe

1128
00:53:58,143 --> 00:53:59,423
I'm look at that joke

1129
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:05,567
I don't have any proof that he's a money launderer so

1130
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:07,871
Some level I admire that Owens

1131
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:08,639
Troyer was

1132
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:10,175
Least saying nothing

1133
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:16,575
You know it's trying or true but at least it wasn't

1134
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:17,599
Dumbass hair

1135
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:19,903
And Alex can't hang I mean I don't know if it's

1136
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:20,671
Just because you

1137
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:23,999
It's that late and you're tired

1138
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:29,119
But you do that at noon and Alex is

1139
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:30,143
Alex's

1140
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:30,911
Afraid

1141
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:33,727
Making that kind of a conch

1142
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:34,495
Creek claim

1143
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:36,287
Alex Wood

1144
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:37,823
Would much rather just

1145
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:39,359
Go for the

1146
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:40,895
Emasculate

1147
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:44,735
As opposed to anything else because he knows his viewers aren't really going

1148
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:45,503
Care

1149
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:49,087
Like David brought you can say David Brock is a money launderer

1150
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:50,111
And they'll be like

1151
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:56,511
What's that he looks like I'd lobotomized

1152
00:54:56,767 --> 00:55:00,095
Whatever it is

1153
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:02,143
The next clip

1154
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:03,935
Topic of money laundry

1155
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:07,263
No

1156
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:11,359
Fortified supply.com

1157
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:13,151
Text deadline

1158
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:14,431
April

1159
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:17,247
15 are fast approaching

1160
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:18,527
Alex

1161
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:21,855
I don't want to I don't know for sure I don't know all the answer

1162
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:22,879
Isabel law

1163
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:25,695
But I think he might be doing some money laundering

1164
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:27,487
I don't think that's libel

1165
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:34,143
This is when I get there this going to get their dicks

1166
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:37,471
His hair

1167
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:38,751
It's not enough

1168
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:42,591
Mars attack

1169
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:58,975
Actually

1170
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:04,095
He's a connoisseur of Vienna sausage

1171
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:11,519
Yes

1172
00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:17,919
David Brock has a

1173
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:24,319
The super Pacs hosting these parties are actually he served miniature wieners

1174
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:29,183
Boyfriend

1175
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:31,487
Breakfast sausages

1176
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:33,023
What restaurant

1177
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:47,359
F****** Crush holes around like a

1178
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:51,199
I bet

1179
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:52,223
Rex

1180
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:55,039
I'm trying to insinuate that is super gay

1181
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:58,367
I'm trying to insinuate that Vienna sausage

1182
00:56:58,879 --> 00:56:59,647
The

1183
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:06,047
That you said was actually a bit as a two-man Act

1184
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:07,327
Is that like

1185
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:08,607
Owen is doing

1186
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:10,399
Exactly what you should do

1187
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:16,287
Well because Alex's bring it up the mini Weenies and what-have-you to make

1188
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:18,335
Expunge of the idea that David Brock is gay

1189
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:21,151
And Owen is like well actually

1190
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:22,687
Now bring up

1191
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:24,479
Substance

1192
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:29,087
It's true or not is another matter

1193
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:32,415
He had to pay his boyfriend all this money

1194
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:35,999
No no I'm literally

1195
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:38,047
Alex

1196
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:40,863
You are the worst

1197
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:42,911
You have already dumped the B

1198
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:44,447
You're trying to do it again

1199
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:48,799
And Owen doesn't have the Improv chops to roll with it like

1200
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:52,383
He's like

1201
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:53,919
Yeah right yes I mean

1202
00:57:56,735 --> 00:58:00,063
Well the thing to is there like I don't know exact

1203
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:02,623
Actually what the money they're talking about is

1204
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:03,647
I don't really care

1205
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:06,207
This is just part of their pizzagate coverage

1206
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:07,231
Because David Brock

1207
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:08,767
Ex-boyfriend is James elefante

1208
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:10,047
Who owns

1209
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:11,071
King Kong Pizza

1210
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:15,679
Which was the center which was the center of the you didn't know that

1211
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:18,495
This whole thing happen

1212
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:23,103
Paramount Pizza

1213
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:25,919
Obviously false

1214
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:26,943
And then

1215
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:28,991
It has a moniker of

1216
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:34,623
Blank. I don't give a s*** already

1217
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:37,951
After that figure out a different why is everything

1218
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:41,279
Now I'm doing an old bit

1219
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:43,327
Is it that they don't make

1220
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:44,863
Planes out of pizza

1221
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:51,007
The whole reason the pizzagate got Beaumont Event

1222
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:52,799
Focus

1223
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:54,335
Steampunk

1224
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:57,919
Because emails that got leaked

1225
00:58:58,175 --> 00:58:59,967
There were emails

1226
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:03,039
Between John podesta and James

1227
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:05,343
Because James alefantis would host

1228
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:06,879
Podesta

1229
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:08,415
Hillary Clinton

1230
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:10,719
Related fundraisers at,

1231
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:13,023
Because it was one of the

1232
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:14,047
Hottest

1233
00:59:14,303 --> 00:59:16,863
Best pizza places in washing

1234
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:22,239
Got that

1235
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:24,287
No I don't I don't know

1236
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:30,687
I feel like it's not even appropriate before that

1237
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:32,223
To another reason

1238
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:34,015
That I hate them

1239
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:36,063
Because it Rhonda perfect

1240
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:39,647
I don't think so I think they had already broken up by that point

1241
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:41,951
I don't know people's private

1242
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:43,487
Not really all that important

1243
00:59:43,743 --> 00:59:44,511
Fair enough but

1244
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:46,559
I do think

1245
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:50,655
I do think that one of the reasons they pizzagate got pushed the way it did

1246
00:59:50,911 --> 00:59:52,447
Is because James alefantis

1247
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:53,471
What had a connection

1248
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:59,103
Interest have a very serious boners

1249
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:00,127
They want to crush

1250
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:01,151
Because

1251
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:02,687
I mean Hijos

1252
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:04,735
The most widely

1253
01:00:04,991 --> 01:00:06,015
The traffic site that

1254
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:07,039
Debunks their bulshit

1255
01:00:07,295 --> 01:00:10,367
So it may all that is to say

1256
01:00:11,135 --> 01:00:12,159
I don't know what money

1257
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:13,951
David Brock gave James Oliphant

1258
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:18,047
I don't particularly care I imagine it wasn't blackmail

1259
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:20,095
That's Wyoming

1260
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:24,447
Claim that they never covered Pete

1261
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:25,215
Pizzagate today

1262
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:26,751
They talked about a lot of it

1263
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:29,055
A business clip

1264
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:30,079
We get the

1265
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:30,847
First sin

1266
01:00:31,103 --> 01:00:31,615
Sensible thing

1267
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:32,383
It said bye

1268
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:34,175
Staff member of Infowars

1269
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:36,735
RAB do

1270
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:38,527
Says guys what are we

1271
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:40,575
Rob dude sitting on the sidelines

1272
01:00:41,343 --> 01:00:41,855
And he has

1273
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:43,135
It's not reasonable

1274
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:45,439
What is the most measured response

1275
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:46,463
I think of any

1276
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:09,247
To this 10-year anniversary

1277
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:17,439
Well let's see your hopes

1278
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:18,975
Just beautiful to me

1279
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:22,047
The problem

1280
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:23,839
It's Rodger Stone

1281
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:28,447
Not Julian Assange

1282
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:32,287
He started to

1283
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:35,871
Smell something weird

1284
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:39,967
Weird

1285
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:40,735
Stone

1286
01:01:40,991 --> 01:01:42,527
Smooth this over

1287
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:43,551
Like immediately

1288
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:46,367
Late like Alex almost certainly had like this

1289
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:52,767
Rodger

1290
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:54,559
We're going to take care of it

1291
01:02:04,031 --> 01:02:08,639
During our March 30th episode when I did a impression of him saying that Adam Schiff is a p****

1292
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:12,735
Alright I have never been able to recap

1293
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:15,295
Whatever we really translator

1294
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:16,575
That's pretty close

1295
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:19,391
Good but I don't know

1296
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:22,463
Where's on

1297
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:24,511
There's more and more the

1298
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:25,279
The history

1299
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:26,047
Of Wiki

1300
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:27,327
More

1301
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:28,095
People

1302
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:30,143
Just talking to big game about all day but

1303
01:02:30,911 --> 01:02:32,703
Yes and it is certain point

1304
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:33,727
Starts to grow

1305
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:40,639
Questions from the audience

1306
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:52,927
Impatient I'm here sweetheart

1307
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:55,231
Don't call her sweetheart

1308
01:02:56,255 --> 01:03:01,119
Don't call her sweetheart 9:00 is he can get in these here parts

1309
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:01,887
I mean I guess

1310
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:04,447
I guess it's better than cupcakes

1311
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:05,471
Still don't call her

1312
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:08,287
He comes from a different era

1313
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:10,079
He doesn't

1314
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:13,407
Maybe ten years older.

1315
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:15,199
That's really f***** up to

1316
01:03:17,247 --> 01:03:19,551
Not more than ten years older than

1317
01:03:21,855 --> 01:03:22,879
Yeah I know right

1318
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:24,159
He looks like s***

1319
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:25,951
Anyway

1320
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:30,815
In this place

1321
01:03:31,071 --> 01:03:35,935
I don't I don't want to gild the Lily with their specific talk I can just bluntly throw that out

1324
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:40,799
He's getting like cuz at this point

1325
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:41,823
Still think

1326
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:45,151

Live coverage

1336
01:04:21,759 --> 01:04:24,831
42 minutes into it

1337
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:37,119
Problems with people doing the presentation are so cool

1338
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:39,679
Information

1339
01:04:40,191 --> 01:04:41,983

Press conference

1345

Bassholes haircut

1346
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:56,831
Do you fix a man whose hairline is receding

1347
01:04:57,599 --> 01:05:00,415
I can respect that at 3 a.m. he's like

1348
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:02,463
Haircuts

1349
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:05,535
Your hair is so good

1350
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:08,095
Brandy motherfuker

1351
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:11,423
Alright I'm going to let him off the hook for that cuz I will

1352
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:15,775
Do not understand it at all

1353
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:20,127
This is why I get called

1354
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:23,967
It's not whatever it is you're about to

1355
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:28,063
Sometimes

1356
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:31,135
You name it

1357
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:33,439
Because I don't have

1358
01:05:33,695 --> 01:05:35,999
On a weird Power Trip

1359
01:05:36,255 --> 01:05:37,535
Article

1360
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:44,703
Where the future where huge Wikileaks is gray

1361
01:05:45,215 --> 01:05:47,263
But it's good to see how unpretentious grudges

1362
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:51,871
You just said you're the future

1363
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:54,431
How unpretentious Infowars

1364
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:04,671
What we've done

1365
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:14,399
Andrew Breitbart

1366
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:18,239
Amazing video

1367
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:21,311
Packers

1368
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:23,103
And then the stuff they released

1369
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:26,175
It didn't quite live up to what it would be

1370
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:28,735
New video

1371
01:06:29,247 --> 01:06:30,271
So you guys back

1372
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:32,575
Do the the Wikileaks conference

1373
01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:33,599
Because he realized

1374
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:40,255
Because we didn't know

1375
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:42,047
Is nonsense

1376
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:49,471
Obama it was not the next day that he died

1377
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:50,495
It was

1378
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:53,311
Later he had enough

1379
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:55,103
He died of a heart attack

1380
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:59,967
Because he was a very unhealthy man who's probably deeply into cocaine

1381
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:08,671
Who was watching

1382
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:10,207
I don't know

1383
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:16,863
Look I saw Andrew Kennedy I'm just going to go through a list of the Supreme Court Justices I wish were dead

1384
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:19,423
A video of the other day and I got

1385
01:07:27,103 --> 01:07:27,615
The truth

1386
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:30,943
You know what I did I know that I'm wrong about

1387
01:07:31,455 --> 01:07:31,967
I know I am

1388
01:07:33,503 --> 01:07:34,271
Ahead of me saying

1389
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:36,831
I do I'm wrong

1390
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:41,183
I think I could hang with Andrew Breitbart and not like

1391
01:07:41,439 --> 01:07:41,951
Beat his ass

1392
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:42,975
Or something like that

1393
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:47,071
I wouldn't I wouldn't be so angry if I hung out with Alex

1394
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:47,839
I would Li

1395
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:50,399
When I say beat his ass

1396
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:53,215
43 NASCAR

1397
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:56,031
Unless you and

1398
01:07:59,103 --> 01:08:00,127
I would hang out with Alex

1399
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:02,687
Talk to him for a little bit I got to go

1400
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:04,735
I think I can hang out have a couple drink

1401
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:06,271
With Andrew Breitbart

1402
01:08:06,527 --> 01:08:07,807
And think he's an a******

1403
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:09,599
Also slap him on the shoulder

1404
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:10,623
Maybe like you peace

1405
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:13,695
Play we could be

1406
01:08:14,207 --> 01:08:15,231
Conviva enemies

1407
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:16,511
Like Matt Campbell

1408
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:19,583
I watch the video of him like convivial by

1409
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:23,679
Whatever I watch the video him like f****** with some protesters

1410
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:25,471
Pizza

1411
01:08:28,543 --> 01:08:29,823
That's not

1412
01:08:30,847 --> 01:08:33,919
Whenever were reminiscing finally about whenever

1413
01:08:34,175 --> 01:08:35,199
Things were less

1414
01:08:35,455 --> 01:08:41,599
Roller skate roller skate roller skate

1415
01:08:41,855 --> 01:08:44,415
You guys going to push me over

1416
01:08:44,671 --> 01:08:46,463
Olivia

1417
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:47,999
That is pretty funny

1418
01:08:48,255 --> 01:08:53,631
Anyway I will give the ghost of Andrew

1419
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:56,959
I've also been considering the possibility that since

1420
01:08:57,215 --> 01:08:58,495
The Deep dive

1421
01:08:58,751 --> 01:08:59,775
Researched his dad

1422
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:02,079
And I know how people like Alex Jones

1423
01:09:02,591 --> 01:09:03,359
Misused it

1424
01:09:03,615 --> 01:09:04,383
For their own purposes

1425
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:05,151
I might do

1426
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:06,175
Just feel misplaced

1427
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:08,991
Entirely possible

1428
01:09:09,247 --> 01:09:10,527
Whatever the case

1429
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:12,831
Don't.

1430
01:09:13,343 --> 01:09:13,855
Second player games

1431
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:17,695
Kill Andrew Breitbart for their own purposes

1432
01:09:18,207 --> 01:09:19,743
There's no question we should be

1433
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:21,791
Yeah

1434
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:25,887
Your partner with that contented a heart attack

1435
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:29,215
Anyway it is next clip Alex Jones confirms once again

1436
01:09:29,727 --> 01:09:30,239
Des

1437
01:09:38,943 --> 01:09:43,551
Waiting for Santa Paws

1438
01:09:43,807 --> 01:09:45,599
4 / 0

1439
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:49,951
We start investigating reports out first

1440
01:09:50,207 --> 01:09:51,999
We Charlie waffles control

1441
01:09:52,255 --> 01:09:53,279
Let's go back to

1442
01:09:53,791 --> 01:09:55,839
Sarah Harrison abs

1443
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:01,471
So no radish

1444
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:02,495
Can Santa Claus

1445
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:03,519
He is coming

1446
01:10:05,823 --> 01:10:07,103
Very soon

1447
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:08,895
Yep that's where he's at

1448
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:12,735
Snowden

1449
01:10:13,247 --> 01:10:15,039
Had nothing to do with WikiLeaks

1450
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:17,343
It was Glenn Greenwald and the guardian

1451
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:22,975
But I also think they just to give Alex a little bit of credit within that context or you saying

1452
01:10:23,487 --> 01:10:26,303
It's not 121 necessarily that he was saying

1453
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:28,095
Vulcan

1454
01:10:28,351 --> 01:10:30,911
It's possible that what he was saying is

1455
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:32,191
Stream media screwed

1456
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:33,471
Snowden over

1457
01:10:35,263 --> 01:10:36,031
Maybe he's going to

1458
01:10:36,287 --> 01:10:37,055
Finger Greenwald

1459
01:10:37,311 --> 01:10:38,079
I'm not entirely sure

1460
01:10:39,871 --> 01:10:41,407
Screwed no I don't think you did

1461
01:10:41,663 --> 01:10:47,295
He didn't know I don't think I think that if you look at the what he said

1462
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:51,135
I think if you look at a proper pronoun usage is beyond Alex

1463
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:52,159
Yeah

1464
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:55,231
Good morals the complaints that he made in that clip that you're referencing

1465
01:10:55,487 --> 01:10:56,767
What we're about

1466
01:10:57,023 --> 01:11:01,375
Like the Washington Post that's true I don't know

1467
01:11:01,631 --> 01:11:02,143
He might

1468
01:11:02,655 --> 01:11:03,935
Still think it's known was involved

1469
01:11:04,191 --> 01:11:04,959
But

1470
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:06,239
I we can't we can

1471
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:07,775
For sure

1472
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:09,311
This point

1473
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:10,591
The time has run out

1474
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:11,871
Clock has run out

1475
01:11:12,639 --> 01:11:13,407
It's time for Snowden

1476
01:11:14,431 --> 01:11:15,199
Now you got to know tonight

1477
01:11:15,711 --> 01:11:19,039
I got if it's time for a song to make his his appearance

1478
01:11:21,087 --> 01:11:21,599
In this clip

1479
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:22,623
They're waiting

1480
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:23,903
The people doing the Prescott

1481
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:25,951
To get him on the phone

1482
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:27,999
I Am The Alex Jones

1483
01:11:28,511 --> 01:11:29,023
Violent

1484
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:31,327
Come on now

1485
01:11:37,983 --> 01:11:44,127

Watch the blood spray

1487
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:56,159
Magic

1488
01:11:56,415 --> 01:11:59,999
Restarted the computer

1489
01:12:01,023 --> 01:12:04,351
That's out

1490
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:13,311
So a little Punch-Drunk now I think I might have had a few drinks

1491
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:17,151
Still don't think he's had a few drinks.

1492
01:12:17,407 --> 01:12:21,503
You get it that you get to that like for 5 a.m. moment

1493
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:24,319
You stop being like I like if you

1494
01:12:24,575 --> 01:12:26,367
If you remember like

01:12:26,623 --> 01:12:28,159
Yeah bladi remember when people use

1496
01:12:28,415 --> 01:12:28,927

And you'd like to everybody

I'm scared

1502
01:12:44,031 --> 01:12:45,055
Budgeted lovingly

1503
01:12:45,823 --> 01:12:47,103

First album in the guide

1505

For good measure

1506
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:52,479
That part was

1507
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:53,247
Politico

1508
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:54,015
That was just

1509
01:12:54,271 --> 01:13:00,415
Regular technical difficulties

1510
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:05,535
First loser

1511
01:13:06,559 --> 01:13:07,071
PopularMMOs

1512
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:10,655
So I was correct

1513
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:11,679
Language

1514
01:13:11,935 --> 01:13:12,447
Fight time

1515
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:17,823
Tonight this is annoying I'm not burning into my weird grammar number. Has been appropriate

1516
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:18,847
Because I have mispronounced

1517
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:21,919
Couple words or or

1518
01:13:22,943 --> 01:13:23,711
The pamplemousse

1519
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:25,247
Anyway

1520
01:13:26,271 --> 01:13:27,295
So Alex

1521
01:13:28,063 --> 01:13:28,575
At this point

1522
01:13:29,855 --> 01:13:30,367
Saint John the

1523
01:13:33,695 --> 01:13:34,207
7

1524
01:13:35,487 --> 01:13:36,255
Alex

1525
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:40,351
So they think they're going to get us on

1526
01:13:40,863 --> 01:13:41,375
Direct

1527
01:13:42,143 --> 01:13:42,655
What do you mean

1528
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:45,983
Find me an Infowars thinks that they're going to call us on

1529
01:13:46,495 --> 01:13:47,519
And it sounds just going to answer

1530
01:13:49,823 --> 01:13:53,663
The people doing the press conference that they've been watching our calling a song

1531
01:13:53,919 --> 01:13:55,967
Because he can

1532
01:13:57,247 --> 01:13:58,527
That's what they're trying to get him on

1533
01:13:58,783 --> 01:13:59,295
Skype

1534
01:13:59,551 --> 01:14:00,831
And they had a little bike

1535
01:14:01,599 --> 01:14:02,623
Difficulty or whatever

1536
01:14:03,903 --> 01:14:10,047
Beyond hair

1537
01:14:10,303 --> 01:14:10,815
He's

1538
01:14:11,327 --> 01:14:12,095
Gung ho

1539
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:13,631
In this the globalist

1540
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:15,679
They're trying to stop him from talking

1541
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:17,471
When in reality

1542
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:18,751
Skype drop

1543
01:14:20,287 --> 01:14:21,311
Skype call

1544
01:14:22,847 --> 01:14:23,615
Suisan

1545
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:24,639
Get on

1546
01:14:25,663 --> 01:14:26,175
Restart stalking

1547
01:14:26,687 --> 01:14:27,967
About the history of Wicca

1548
01:14:30,015 --> 01:14:30,783
Alex Jones

1549
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:33,599
Starts to realize

1550
01:14:34,879 --> 01:14:37,183
It's not going to go his way to realize this might be

1551
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:50,239
World

1552
01:14:56,127 --> 01:15:02,271
Alex is Alex

1553
01:15:02,527 --> 01:15:03,039
Alex

1554
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:03,807
I think

1555
01:15:05,855 --> 01:15:08,415
Vicky wants to own a fox

1556
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:12,767
I stayed up

1557
01:15:13,023 --> 01:15:13,535
For this

1558
01:15:14,815 --> 01:15:17,119
God what am I doing with my life

1559
01:15:19,167 --> 01:15:21,471
Alex

1560
01:15:21,727 --> 01:15:22,239
Disappointed

1561
01:15:22,495 --> 01:15:23,775
I meant something happen

1562
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:25,055
I was with Owen Shroyer

1563
01:15:28,383 --> 01:15:29,407
Considering he claims

1564
01:15:30,431 --> 01:15:30,943
St.Louis

1565
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:37,343
Okay

1566
01:15:48,607 --> 01:15:49,631
State Lewis me

1567
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:51,679
Why does he say Shack

1568
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:52,703
Because he

1569
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:53,983
He's from the East Coast

1570
01:15:55,263 --> 01:15:58,079
He was going with

1571
01:15:58,591 --> 01:16:00,127
It's 3 in the morning

1572
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:01,663
So it coming through

1573
01:16:01,919 --> 01:16:02,943
Flipped out boy

1574
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:06,527
He's actually probably some sort of bougie

1575
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:08,319
A******

1576
01:16:08,575 --> 01:16:09,599
Comes from money and you

1577
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:11,647
Is claims that he's from Lisbon

1578
01:16:11,903 --> 01:16:12,927
He could be a selfie

1579
01:16:14,463 --> 01:16:14,975
Fine

1580
01:16:15,231 --> 01:16:17,279
Even so then why would you cover that up

1581
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:21,119
That would be perfect for the info

1582
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:24,959
Pretend isn't really him

1583
01:16:25,471 --> 01:16:25,983
I'm Shack

1584
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:27,263
Probably from New Hampshire

1585
01:16:28,031 --> 01:16:29,055
Maybe I don't know

1586
01:16:29,311 --> 01:16:31,103
Whatever it is

1587
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:32,895
It's the only state on the East Coast

1588
01:16:33,663 --> 01:16:34,175
All the recipe

1589
01:16:36,223 --> 01:16:36,991
What about Rhode Island

1590
01:16:37,247 --> 01:16:37,759
I never heard of

1591
01:16:40,575 --> 01:16:42,623
But like that that to me is really fast

1592
01:16:42,879 --> 01:16:44,927
Cuz it happened another time to I've heard that happen twice

1593
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:46,207
And both times

1594
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:47,743
He's like said

1595
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:51,327
Shack or the other word was then immediately

1596
01:16:52,095 --> 01:16:52,607
I am shocked

1597
01:16:52,863 --> 01:16:53,887
Fitbit's

1598
01:16:54,143 --> 01:16:54,655
That's cray

1599
01:16:55,167 --> 01:16:56,191
That's crazy

1600
01:16:56,703 --> 01:16:57,727
Especially because

1601
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:00,287
He did have an actual Missouri accent

1602
01:17:01,823 --> 01:17:02,335
Even be a thing

1603
01:17:02,591 --> 01:17:03,103
No

1604
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:03,871
When

1605
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:04,639
When Heaven

1606
01:17:04,895 --> 01:17:05,407
You been

1607
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:06,431
So tired

1608
01:17:06,943 --> 01:17:07,455
That you act

1609
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:08,479
Accidentally pronounce

1610
01:17:08,735 --> 01:17:11,295
Something in a regional accent that wasn't your ex

1611
01:17:11,551 --> 01:17:12,063
Actual speaking

1612
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:15,135
Oh that's crazy because I am from Zimbabwe

1613
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:15,903
So

1614
01:17:16,415 --> 01:17:17,439
Adalat can

1615
01:17:17,695 --> 01:17:18,463
I can't let that

1616
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:22,815
We're getting out of the wrong

1617
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:24,095
Country

1618
01:17:24,351 --> 01:17:27,423
Greenpoint from the chat room that is at Wisconsin also has that

1619
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:30,751
Or Minnesota

1620
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:33,823
True Minnesota

1621
01:17:36,383 --> 01:17:38,943
I don't know there's something very specific about the

1622
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:41,759
It seems East Coast

1623
01:17:42,015 --> 01:17:44,831
I might just be biased because I grew up in Boston

1624
01:17:45,087 --> 01:17:47,135
For a little bit when I was younger

1625
01:17:47,391 --> 01:17:48,671
Spinx of Massachusetts

1626
01:17:49,695 --> 01:17:50,975
In in my experience

1627
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:51,743
I agree

1628
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:53,791
There's it that these owl is like

1629
01:17:54,047 --> 01:17:55,071
We different

1630
01:17:55,327 --> 01:17:56,095
The phone app

1631
01:17:56,351 --> 01:17:59,167
Wisconsin Minnesota

1632
01:17:59,423 --> 01:17:59,935
Boston

1633
01:18:03,263 --> 01:18:03,775
He's got a ginger

1634
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:07,871
So they also have it also goes along with the sort of

1635
01:18:08,127 --> 01:18:09,407
Traditional Boston

1636
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:12,479
Anyway it was next with Alex Jones realizes B truck

1637
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:19,135
Well we're just going to be honest

1638
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:23,487
And

1639
01:18:29,887 --> 01:18:31,423
Aaron baddeley

1640
01:18:33,983 --> 01:18:36,287
Because I'm sitting here and we've got him

1641
01:18:36,799 --> 01:18:38,335
Call Sharon

1642
01:18:42,175 --> 01:18:48,319
I'm struggling to make out a lot of boy saying I've been trying to hear the words Clinton Or democrats are you

1643
01:18:53,951 --> 01:18:57,535
Let's go back to

1644
01:18:58,559 --> 01:18:59,839
Might be a little bit of

1645
01:19:00,095 --> 01:19:00,863
Insight

1646
01:19:04,191 --> 01:19:06,239
The oddest thing he's ever said

1647
01:19:06,495 --> 01:19:08,543
We might be too stupid to understand

1648
01:19:09,311 --> 01:19:11,103
I mean he's being quiet but yeah

1649
01:19:13,407 --> 01:19:14,175
Talking about the

1650
01:19:14,431 --> 01:19:15,199
History of WikiLeaks

1651
01:19:15,455 --> 01:19:15,967
Right

1652
01:19:16,223 --> 01:19:18,783
That's what the press conference is about in the reason that

1653
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:21,343
Because they are looking for XY

1654
01:19:21,599 --> 01:19:22,111
Lindsey in it

1655
01:19:22,367 --> 01:19:23,135
And you only get

1656
01:19:27,231 --> 01:19:30,815
This is all Greek To Me

1657
01:19:31,839 --> 01:19:33,887
It's just their disappointment showing proof

1658
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:35,167
2 to the

1659
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:37,983
To the actual reality of the Prescott

1660
01:19:38,751 --> 01:19:40,799
Can you really point to

1661
01:19:43,103 --> 01:19:45,407
Earth-shattering things other than

1662
01:19:45,919 --> 01:19:47,711
Chelsea Manning's revelation

1663
01:19:47,967 --> 01:19:50,527
And the way that they f***** up the US

1664
01:19:51,295 --> 01:19:52,063
For WikiLeaks

1665
01:19:54,111 --> 01:19:54,623
I don't think so

1666
01:19:54,879 --> 01:19:55,391
Yeah right

1667
01:19:57,183 --> 01:19:57,951
Interesting

1668
01:19:58,207 --> 01:19:58,975
Stuff possibly

1669
01:19:59,487 --> 01:19:59,999
Buena Vista

1670
01:20:00,255 --> 01:20:01,023
Some things that are

1671
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:01,791
Interesting

1672
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:04,607
Groundbreaker

1673
01:20:04,863 --> 01:20:06,655
A lot of releases bad

1674
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:14,336
Are embarrassing for the US government but a lot of those were just things that

1675
01:20:15,872 --> 01:20:17,664
Uninteresting to the general populace

1676
01:20:18,176 --> 01:20:20,736
And if you really get into them you'll be like this

1677
01:20:20,992 --> 01:20:25,600
Does mean something

1678
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:27,136
Yeah situation

1679
01:20:27,904 --> 01:20:29,184
Yeah yeah probably

1680
01:20:29,952 --> 01:20:31,744
Well

1681
01:20:32,512 --> 01:20:33,536
Anniversary

1682
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:35,072
Explanation you need to be more like

1683
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:38,144
Chelsea Manning is a literal hero

1684
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:39,680
That was imprisoned

1685
01:20:41,728 --> 01:20:43,008
I mean

1686
01:20:43,264 --> 01:20:46,848
In their press conference Maybe

1687
01:20:47,104 --> 01:20:50,688
That's true of all we can do is look at Alex Jones having a real bad time

1688
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:52,224
At 23 in the morning

1689
01:20:52,736 --> 01:20:53,504
It's delightful

1690
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:54,272
I love it

1691
01:20:54,528 --> 01:20:57,856
Alex Jones fully realizes this is nothing

1692
01:20:58,368 --> 01:20:59,648
And that he floats

1693
01:21:15,008 --> 01:21:16,800
Going to

1694
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:34,464
What

1695
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:45,728
Call position

1696
01:21:52,896 --> 01:21:58,528
Like a little bit of love it I love it he's now insisting Assange has made a deal with Hillary

1697
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:00,576
Nobody said there at the end

1698
01:22:00,832 --> 01:22:01,856
He's making a deal

1699
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:04,416
Witchy reinforces

1700
01:22:04,672 --> 01:22:05,184
Miss Mexico

1701
01:22:24,128 --> 01:22:25,152
34

1702
01:22:36,416 --> 01:22:38,976
Change the weather to

1703
01:22:39,232 --> 01:22:45,376
Devastating

1704
01:22:48,192 --> 01:22:50,752
12 yd

1705
01:22:54,848 --> 01:22:55,360
So

1706
01:22:59,712 --> 01:23:00,736
Phineas like

1707
01:23:02,784 --> 01:23:03,552
If Alex

1708
01:23:04,064 --> 01:23:05,600
At this point in October

1709
01:23:06,112 --> 01:23:08,416
16 was so confident about Trump and everything like

1710
01:23:08,928 --> 01:23:13,792
Why are you freaking out about how we only have 34 days for secret information

1711
01:23:14,048 --> 01:23:16,608
To be released by this organization

1712
01:23:16,864 --> 01:23:18,144
In order to win the election

1713
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:23,776
Desperate for this information on the table screaming 34 days

1714
01:23:25,568 --> 01:23:29,920
Kind of kind of gives a different picture than his

1715
01:23:33,504 --> 01:23:34,272
I just

1716
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:36,832
This is

1717
01:23:37,344 --> 01:23:39,136
This is so good this is like

1718
01:23:41,696 --> 01:23:42,208
Are dabs

1719
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:44,000
Broadcast live

1720
01:23:44,512 --> 01:23:46,048
He would constantly be like

1721
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:47,328
Oh I'm wrong

1722
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:50,656
Oh no I'm wrong oh no I'm wrong

1723
01:23:50,912 --> 01:23:56,544
Like that's why you don't do things live Alex

1724
01:23:57,312 --> 01:23:59,872
Hawaii

1725
01:24:00,128 --> 01:24:01,408
Rodger Stone his accident

1726
01:24:01,664 --> 01:24:02,176
Lirette.

1727
01:24:03,456 --> 01:24:06,272
So in this next clip is

1728
01:24:08,576 --> 01:24:10,880
That is the reason other news outlets

1729
01:24:11,392 --> 01:24:12,672
You teleprompters

1730
01:24:15,488 --> 01:24:17,024
And protect their overnight

1731
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:20,864
Because I can't verify it

1732
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:23,680
Also that's why news outlets don't be like

1733
01:24:27,264 --> 01:24:28,800
You don't hear Jake

1734
01:24:29,056 --> 01:24:30,336
Tapper being like

1735
01:24:30,592 --> 01:24:36,736
Here's my prediction this interview will verify every little thing that I hope

1736
01:24:36,992 --> 01:24:41,344
Pray for

1737
01:24:44,416 --> 01:24:46,208
At this point things turn ugly

1738
01:24:47,488 --> 01:24:48,256
Alex

1739
01:25:05,664 --> 01:25:09,760

1740
01:25:10,016 --> 01:25:10,784
Crackly laugh

1741
01:25:11,296 --> 01:25:15,648
After he said

1742
01:25:15,904 --> 01:25:16,416
It's a

1743
01:25:16,672 --> 01:25:17,184
Constant

1744
01:25:18,976 --> 01:25:23,584
Paqui cracked up

1745
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:26,400
I agree with

1746
01:25:26,912 --> 01:25:27,680
That was hilarious

1747
01:25:47,648 --> 01:25:50,464
Interesting

1748
01:26:00,192 --> 01:26:01,472
It was in the WikiLeaks

1749
01:26:01,984 --> 01:26:02,752
But not this time

1750
01:26:05,056 --> 01:26:07,360
I am greatly disappointed my God

1751
01:26:07,872 --> 01:26:10,688
So this exquisite

1755
01:26:17,088 --> 01:26:18,112
I get to just B like

1756
01:26:18,624 --> 01:26:19,136

1759
01:26:23,744 --> 01:26:26,048
Don't worry it's not over

1760
01:26:26,304 --> 01:26:30,656
Hillary Alex's b******* is not nearly over

1761
01:26:30,912 --> 01:26:32,192

1764
01:26:36,032 --> 01:26:36,544
Weirdest

1765
01:26:37,056 --> 01:26:38,592
I'm going to spoil it ahead of time is an adverb

1766
01:26:40,896 --> 01:26:41,920
Where is being racist

1767
01:26:42,688 --> 01:26:47,552
He's going he's going all-in on being sexist racist

1768
01:26:47,808 --> 01:26:52,160
Disrespectful

1769
01:26:54,464 --> 01:26:55,488

1770
01:26:55,744 --> 01:26:57,024

Sales and product by the way we have no no no no no

1777
01:27:34,912 --> 01:27:36,448
What's fascinating to me about that

1778
01:27:36,704 --> 01:27:39,264
Three pieces of that that's crazy

1779
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:40,288
First is

1780
01:27:40,544 --> 01:27:43,360
We got trolled

1781
01:27:43,616 --> 01:27:49,760
Which is like admitting that you're not a journalism Outlet first of all

1782
01:27:50,528 --> 01:27:53,088
Soccer in house

1783
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:54,368
Second

1784
01:27:54,624 --> 01:27:55,136
Is that

1785
01:27:55,392 --> 01:27:56,416
Julian Assange

1786
01:27:56,672 --> 01:27:57,184

1793
01:28:06,912 --> 01:28:07,424
It's

1794
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:08,960
Like a knee-jerk reaction

1795
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:16,128
Product for some reason I have to like there's going on

1796
01:28:23,808 --> 01:28:24,320
We're just like

1797
01:28:24,576 --> 01:28:26,368
We have some knowledge right buttons

1798
01:28:26,624 --> 01:28:28,672
And he will shut down and just start

1799
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:34,816
Muscle memory

1800
01:28:35,072 --> 01:28:36,608

1801
01:28:38,912 --> 01:28:41,984
Lower lower it one more time with that in mind

1806
01:29:04,256 --> 01:29:05,536
Let's f****** go through it

1807
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:07,584
It's

1808
01:29:09,376 --> 01:29:11,680
What is always

1809
01:29:12,192 --> 01:29:12,704
In his heart

1810
01:29:13,216 --> 01:29:14,496
Is that

1811
01:29:16,544 --> 01:29:17,824

Comes out

1814
01:29:19,616 --> 01:29:24,224
This is where I would make that argument as opposed to the slit your throat

1815
01:29:28,064 --> 01:29:28,832
More the

01:30:44,352 --> 01:30:48,704
I came here to chew bubblegum and listen to Assange leaked documents

And I got neither and I'm all outta Bubblegum

1836
01:30:53,056 --> 01:30:55,104

The f****** worse

1846
01:31:12,256 --> 01:31:12,768
She's not good

1847

1852
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:26,080
You can't

1853

And I got nothing because that's not a joke that's a c

1854
01:31:31,712 --> 01:31:32,480
In terms of a line

1855
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:34,528
Well but

1856
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:36,576
The reasons I came to

1857
01:31:36,832 --> 01:31:38,112
Chew bubblegum and kick ass

1858
01:31:38,624 --> 01:31:39,648
And I'm all outta Bubblegum

1859
01:31:39,904 --> 01:31:40,416
Works

1860
01:31:40,672 --> 01:31:42,464
Right is because both of those things

1861
01:31:43,744 --> 01:31:44,256
You have can

1862
01:31:44,512 --> 01:31:45,280

Control what Julian Assange

01:31:56,544 --> 01:32:01,152
You're kind of like I am either going to chew bubblegum or passively taking this thing

1869
01:32:01,408 --> 01:32:02,432
Happened

1870
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:03,968
And I don't have gum

1871
01:32:07,552 --> 01:32:08,832

1872
01:32:09,088 --> 01:32:12,928

01:32:57,984 --> 01:32:58,752
Hilarie Burton

1886
01:33:01,056 --> 01:33:03,104
Are you thrilled

1887
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:06,176
Excited to be lip-syncing

1888
01:33:07,712 --> 01:33:11,040
By the way

1889
01:33:11,296 --> 01:33:12,576
It was The Rebirth of The Rock

1890
01:33:12,832 --> 01:33:14,368
So

1891
01:33:16,928 --> 01:33:17,440
Hillary

1892
01:33:17,696 --> 01:33:18,720
October

1893
01:33:18,976 --> 01:33:20,000
Surprise

1894
01:33:20,768 --> 01:33:23,584
Rush is about plug and that is that she has

1895
01:33:24,096 --> 01:33:24,608
Co-op

1896
01:33:24,864 --> 01:33:26,144
Julian Assange

1897
01:33:26,656 --> 01:33:28,192
She is making a deal with them

1898
01:33:28,704 --> 01:33:31,264
And that's the surprise we've been trolled

1899
01:33:32,288 --> 01:33:33,312
Howick

1900
01:33:36,384 --> 01:33:36,896
His

1901
01:33:38,688 --> 01:33:39,456
His insanity

1902
01:33:39,712 --> 01:33:43,552
Tastic extreme

1903
01:33:44,832 --> 01:33:48,416
As just do it all

1904
01:33:48,672 --> 01:33:49,952
But for one night

1905
01:33:51,488 --> 01:33:53,024
Hated them

1906
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:54,048
Much

1907
01:33:54,304 --> 01:33:56,352
Tired and they're the reason he's awake

1908
01:33:56,608 --> 01:33:57,632
Do good

1909
01:33:57,888 --> 01:33:59,168
It's fascinating because like

1910
01:34:00,192 --> 01:34:04,544
This speculation like where he's going with whatever his narratives are

1911
01:34:07,104 --> 01:34:08,128
It's so counter

1912
01:34:08,384 --> 01:34:09,664
To like just being like

1913
01:34:10,688 --> 01:34:11,712
Like if you or you and me

1914
01:34:12,224 --> 01:34:14,528
And we were doing everyday radio

1915
01:34:15,552 --> 01:34:17,344
Julian Assange

1916
01:34:17,856 --> 01:34:21,440
And we were do it like

1917
01:34:21,952 --> 01:34:24,000
Edit turned out he was doing I just like I do

1918
01:34:24,256 --> 01:34:25,536
This is our tenth anniversary would be like

1919
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:28,096
I guess we had it wrong

1920
01:34:28,352 --> 01:34:33,216
Yeah there's no information here I guess but happy 10th anniversary

1921
01:34:33,472 --> 01:34:35,776
PS turned on.

1922
01:34:36,032 --> 01:34:36,800
I think

1923
01:34:37,056 --> 01:34:39,360
I didn't know if we were doing

1924
01:34:39,616 --> 01:34:41,920
Rochelle and you were like

1925
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:42,944
1 Audubon Lake

1926
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:43,712
No

1927
01:34:44,992 --> 01:34:47,040
If we did stay out of my life

1928
01:34:48,064 --> 01:34:50,624
Sky

1929
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:53,952
All right what else is going on

1930
01:34:54,208 --> 01:34:55,232
I don't know what's get out of

1931
01:34:55,488 --> 01:34:57,792
Instead of

1932
01:35:00,608 --> 01:35:01,376
And I can't

1933
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:06,240
Feels so f******

1934
01:35:06,496 --> 01:35:07,520
Hilarious

1935
01:35:10,336 --> 01:35:10,848
So bad

1936
01:35:11,104 --> 01:35:12,128
Because Rodger told him it would be

1937
01:35:12,384 --> 01:35:12,896
B-beg

1938
01:35:22,112 --> 01:35:23,648
Julian Assange

1939
01:35:23,904 --> 01:35:27,232
A lot of pressure being threatened

1940
01:35:27,744 --> 01:35:32,096
But I can tell you

1941
01:35:38,752 --> 01:35:41,568
Flash Maxwell

1942
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:43,104
Every few days

1943
01:35:44,128 --> 01:35:45,152
Election

1944
01:35:45,664 --> 01:35:48,992
But

1945
01:35:49,248 --> 01:35:51,040
Decisive information

1946
01:36:02,816 --> 01:36:06,400
Ambro Eastern Time

1947
01:36:06,912 --> 01:36:08,448
Central Time

1948
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:12,288
You don't know

1949
01:36:12,544 --> 01:36:13,056
In fact

1950
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:15,104
UK

1951
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:17,408
Of course

1952
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:19,712
Literally you didn't show

1953
01:36:20,224 --> 01:36:21,248
Because you do

1954
01:36:22,528 --> 01:36:23,040
And you were

1955
01:36:23,296 --> 01:36:23,808
Screaming

1956
01:36:24,064 --> 01:36:26,112
We got 34 days

1957
01:36:26,368 --> 01:36:28,928
You had the real whistleblowers and real document

1958
01:36:29,184 --> 01:36:29,952
This would be

1959
01:36:30,208 --> 01:36:33,024
You'd be in bed

1960
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:34,304
You are

1961
01:36:34,816 --> 01:36:36,608
That you have those documents

1962
01:36:38,144 --> 01:36:38,912
You could release

1963
01:36:39,168 --> 01:36:39,680
Pizza

1964
01:36:39,936 --> 01:36:42,240
But you were waiting for Julian Assange

1965
01:36:42,496 --> 01:36:43,776
Tilly's really stem

1966
01:36:44,544 --> 01:36:46,592
Because he has a wider audience

1967
01:36:47,104 --> 01:36:49,920
What Cox out the fact that you don't have enough

1968
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:54,528
+ 3

1969
01:36:54,784 --> 01:36:57,344
You had to say we're not losers

1970
01:36:57,856 --> 01:36:58,880
Well you did upset

1971
01:36:59,136 --> 01:37:00,672
Because you don't

1972
01:37:00,928 --> 01:37:06,304
Cuz he is a loser so now the real true comedy of this

1973
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:07,328
Is that

1974
01:37:07,584 --> 01:37:09,120
Has been having people on like

1975
01:37:09,888 --> 01:37:11,936
Esperanto

1976
01:37:12,192 --> 01:37:13,984
And

1977
01:37:16,544 --> 01:37:19,872
People like

1978
01:37:20,128 --> 01:37:23,712
No I don't

1979
01:37:23,968 --> 01:37:25,248
Pretty sure that the fence

1980
01:37:28,064 --> 01:37:29,856
Benghazi

1981
01:37:30,624 --> 01:37:31,136
In his

1982
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:33,440
Rat

1983
01:37:33,952 --> 01:37:35,488
And Tosh Plumlee

1984
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:36,512
Proven

1985
01:37:37,024 --> 01:37:37,792
Did Hillary Clinton

1986
01:37:38,304 --> 01:37:41,376
Was an out-of-control that I've been Ghazi

1987
01:37:42,144 --> 01:37:42,656
Why

1988
01:37:43,168 --> 01:37:44,704
At the beginning of this show

1989
01:37:45,216 --> 01:37:46,240
Would he be saying

1990
01:37:46,752 --> 01:37:47,264
Oh

1991
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:49,824
What's going to happen is that

1992
01:37:51,616 --> 01:37:53,664
Prove everything

1993
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:54,688
We say

1994
01:37:55,456 --> 01:37:55,968
That we

1995
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:01,344
We didn't prove a goddamn

1996
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:04,672
I don't know what proving is or maybe that's worse

1997
01:38:04,928 --> 01:38:07,232
Well he does and that's why he did the show

1998
01:38:08,768 --> 01:38:14,912
You know what proving is the show in order to prove it halfway through

1999
01:38:15,168 --> 01:38:16,448
When he was like alright

2000
01:38:16,704 --> 01:38:20,032
So he's going to give us

2001
01:38:20,288 --> 01:38:21,312
Before everyone

2002
01:38:21,568 --> 01:38:24,384
We're going to ride

2003
01:38:25,408 --> 01:38:31,552
Sure he gives us the dirt is doing a business meeting in the middle of it like here's what we're do on break

2004
01:38:32,576 --> 01:38:33,088
Exactly

2005
01:38:33,344 --> 01:38:34,112
Cuz he doesn't have s***

2006
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:35,648
But he does have

2007
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:39,488
I'm still trying to figure out

2008
01:38:42,816 --> 01:38:45,120
Hack job

2009
01:38:54,848 --> 01:38:59,712
You are saying that you couldn't have no I was going to and I said I would

2010
01:39:00,736 --> 01:39:01,248
That's not going

2011
01:39:01,504 --> 01:39:03,296
Also like the

2012
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:07,392
You can't even give us good audio that's where we flashback to

2013
01:39:07,648 --> 01:39:09,440
The beginning of the show and Owens Mike wasn't

2014
01:39:21,728 --> 01:39:23,008
Stab you in the back like

2015
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:31,712
By the way

2016
01:39:32,992 --> 01:39:34,528
He has destroyed himself

2017
01:39:42,464 --> 01:39:48,096
Rold gold

2018
01:39:48,352 --> 01:39:50,144
Is there black gold

2019
01:40:16,512 --> 01:40:18,560
That was soft

2020
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:25,216
Now we have to wait

2021
01:40:27,776 --> 01:40:33,920
I think we got a new we got a new who was it that remix the last one

2022
01:40:34,176 --> 01:40:40,320
I think we got a new one to talk to Matt

2023
01:40:40,576 --> 01:40:46,464
He heard that song and he just got into the part of it

2024
01:40:46,976 --> 01:40:49,536
Too many other words

2025
01:40:55,424 --> 01:40:58,752
Does not release

2026
01:40:59,264 --> 01:41:01,568
Just describe Rodger Stone

2027
01:41:01,824 --> 01:41:05,152
Course that was it uses or just describe

2028
01:41:05,408 --> 01:41:07,712
He's going on about how

2029
01:41:07,968 --> 01:41:12,064
We had all this information and we were told

2030
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:16,928
And it was a was supposed to comment we had intermediaries and we had the whole thing

2031
01:41:17,184 --> 01:41:18,976
Nothing

2032
01:41:19,232 --> 01:41:20,512
And then he's going to say

2033
01:41:21,536 --> 01:41:22,816
You just gave the exact

2034
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:29,216
That Rodger stone is about to give you

2035
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:32,800
One more clip left

2036
01:41:33,056 --> 01:41:34,080
It is sort of the end

2037
01:41:36,384 --> 01:41:36,896
Adventure

2038
01:41:37,152 --> 01:41:38,944
Early hours of the morning

2039
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:41,248
In this clip

2040
01:41:41,504 --> 01:41:44,320
This is our Colonel Kurtz

2041
01:41:44,576 --> 01:41:45,088
He dead

2042
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:48,416
Alex Jones end.

2043
01:41:48,928 --> 01:41:49,440
Little bit of advice

2044
01:41:50,464 --> 01:41:51,232
Assange

2045
01:41:52,256 --> 01:41:53,024
And then close

2046
01:41:54,048 --> 01:41:55,072
The only way

2047
01:41:55,584 --> 01:41:57,120
Synonym for shokan

2048
01:41:58,144 --> 01:41:59,168
This is basically the

2049
01:41:59,424 --> 01:41:59,936
Freebird

2050
01:42:01,728 --> 01:42:02,752
Hookah Infowars

2051
01:42:03,264 --> 01:42:06,592
Everyone knows exactly how this show is going to have

2052
01:42:08,384 --> 01:42:11,712
I was just wondering news covered and phone calls and cover it up video

2053
01:42:18,112 --> 01:42:20,672
If you want to sell some

2054
01:42:21,184 --> 01:42:22,208
Here's a little advice

2055
01:42:24,768 --> 01:42:29,632
It's hard to pay for all this Runner and support

2056
01:42:30,656 --> 01:42:36,800
Equality video

2057
01:42:37,056 --> 01:42:41,408
Planning this this is something they had to plan

2058
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:43,712
Calling off great great job crew

2059
01:42:54,976 --> 01:42:58,048
T-shirt Starbucks

2060
01:42:58,816 --> 01:43:04,960
Slam dunk slam dunk add pivot Jesus

2061
01:43:07,776 --> 01:43:12,640
And they were planning this room we just decided to do this on the web

2062
01:43:13,152 --> 01:43:17,248
We're bad it was earlier

2063
01:43:17,504 --> 01:43:18,528
But also the other day

2064
01:43:21,088 --> 01:43:23,648
The beginning of the activity was

2065
01:43:29,536 --> 01:43:33,376
Forced to work overtime

2066
01:43:33,632 --> 01:43:36,448
Technically jaller salary

2067
01:43:36,704 --> 01:43:38,240
And this does not count as overtime

2068
01:43:38,496 --> 01:43:40,800
Exactly so I mean

2069
01:43:41,824 --> 01:43:46,176
Disgraceful admitted to end

2070
01:43:46,432 --> 01:43:46,944
Giving

2071
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:48,736
Add pivot advice

2072
01:43:48,992 --> 01:43:51,808
Is just like

2073
01:43:52,064 --> 01:43:53,856
Listen if you want

2074
01:43:54,112 --> 01:43:57,440
Just David

2075
01:43:58,720 --> 01:44:03,072
Physically giving him advice on how to fight over

2076
01:44:03,584 --> 01:44:06,400
If you want dum-dums to send you money

2077
01:44:07,168 --> 01:44:12,544
Pretend you're a victim and then they're going to f****** throw you so much money

2078
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:18,944
It's crazy you have any idea of millions I'm making office cam

2079
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:25,344
He was an overnight if he was like 3 a.m. to 6 a.m. slot on a lot of shows

2080
01:44:25,856 --> 01:44:27,136
We would get such an

2081
01:44:27,392 --> 01:44:28,928
This version of Alex

2082
01:44:29,952 --> 01:44:30,976
Credible

2083
01:44:31,232 --> 01:44:31,744
She would have

2084
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:35,328
He would not know how to lie the correct way

2085
01:44:35,584 --> 01:44:36,352
He's given up

2086
01:44:36,608 --> 01:44:37,120
So much

2087
01:44:37,376 --> 01:44:43,520
Episode did overnight

2088
01:44:43,776 --> 01:44:45,568
To sleep schedule with a job

2089
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:49,664
Eventually he'd be able to live very well

2090
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:50,688
But

2091
01:44:51,712 --> 01:44:55,808
To the end of this adventure and one of the funniest

2092
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:59,648
I got super excited about this b******* that Rodger stone is lied to

2093
01:44:59,904 --> 01:45:04,768

Be good clean fun

2097
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:20,384
Purely good clean

2098
01:45:20,640 --> 01:45:21,920
You know what the other thing is really good

2099
01:45:22,432 --> 01:45:25,248
Is the spiritual end of the

2100
01:45:25,504 --> 01:45:26,272
Michelle

2101
01:45:26,528 --> 01:45:27,808

9 minutes

2114
01:46:00,832 --> 01:46:02,112
The two ads at the end

2115
01:46:02,368 --> 01:46:05,184

2116
01:46:06,464 --> 01:46:08,256

It's traffic controller at the end of the night

2118
01:46:12,608 --> 01:46:17,216
No idea how they were going to end

2119
01:46:17,472 --> 01:46:18,240
One production

2120
01:46:18,496 --> 01:46:19,008
Meeting

2121
01:46:19,264 --> 01:46:19,776
A week

Come on day legitimately thought they were going to go all night with like

2123
01:46:24,128 --> 01:46:27,968
Is working behind the scenes

2124
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:33,344
Digging into whatever whatever Assange is brought to the table

2125
01:46:33,856 --> 01:46:34,624
And instead

2126
01:46:36,416 --> 01:46:37,440
This is

2127
01:46:37,696 --> 01:46:38,464
B I mean this

2128
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:39,488
Truly is

2129
01:46:40,256 --> 01:46:40,768
What happened

2130
01:46:41,024 --> 01:46:42,304
When you allow yourself to

2131
01:46:44,864 --> 01:46:47,680
These are the

2132
01:46:48,448 --> 01:46:49,472
I somehow

2133
01:46:49,984 --> 01:46:50,496
Pink

2134
01:46:51,008 --> 01:46:52,544
Like I suspect

2135
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:54,848
That Rodger stone is going to escape

2136
01:46:55,616 --> 01:46:56,128
Lake

2137
01:46:59,456 --> 01:47:00,736
Rodger stone look alike

2138
01:47:00,992 --> 01:47:07,136
To jail

2139
01:47:07,392 --> 01:47:09,184
We're going to find out he has a secret

2140
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:15,584
Twin like Rodger stone is the trickster God if anyone deserves to live

2141
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:18,656
Live the life of Ernest Goes to prison

2142
01:47:23,264 --> 01:47:26,592
Truck but I'll be goddamn is not a part of

2143
01:47:27,872 --> 01:47:28,384
He's like

2144
01:47:28,640 --> 01:47:29,664
He's like

2145
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:31,712
No do you want him to get hit by a car

2146
01:47:31,968 --> 01:47:32,480
Fly

2147
01:47:32,736 --> 01:47:36,320
40 feet up in the air land with stars around pets

2148
01:47:36,576 --> 01:47:42,720
Look at the goddamn party character on the other side of the street

2149
01:47:42,976 --> 01:47:44,256
Homeless man sitting there

2150
01:47:44,512 --> 01:47:47,072
Who looks at his brown bag in the

2151
01:47:47,328 --> 01:47:47,840
Mangos

2152
01:47:52,192 --> 01:47:58,336
Oh man like you though he's a f****** monster but fifty years

01:47:58,592 --> 01:47:59,104
50 years

2154
01:47:59,360 --> 01:48:05,504
For now his life will be the greatest story ever

2155
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:07,040
Is Catch Me If You Can

2156
01:48:09,344 --> 01:48:14,464
Is profound I can still admire that in real time

2157
01:48:14,720 --> 01:48:15,232
Just stop next

2158
01:48:18,304 --> 01:48:19,328
We could go back in time

2159
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:24,960
He should have been murdered so soon and it would have been fine like so much would have been better

2160
01:48:25,216 --> 01:48:30,080
Easter

2161
01:48:30,336 --> 01:48:33,664

He lived this

2166
01:48:40,832 --> 01:48:43,648
Yeah it is

2167
01:48:44,672 --> 01:48:45,184
Egypt

2168
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:46,464
It's out of everything

2169
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:47,488
God I hate

Like I couldn't give a s***

2176
01:48:58,752 --> 01:49:04,896
I do want to have a drink with Rodger Stone like he's the only person

2177
01:49:07,456 --> 01:49:13,600
With Rodger Stones the next time be like

2178
01:49:13,856 --> 01:49:18,208
Rodger none of us were in the wreck

2179
01:49:18,464 --> 01:49:18,976
The night

2180
01:49:20,768 --> 01:49:22,560
Juno

2181
01:49:23,584 --> 01:49:25,120
It's this weird like

2182
01:49:25,632 --> 01:49:26,144
Confluent

2183
01:49:28,192 --> 01:49:28,960
Personability

2184
01:49:29,728 --> 01:49:30,240
And my

2185
01:49:30,752 --> 01:49:32,544
We're like Alex Jones

2186
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:34,336
Not personable and a month

2187
01:49:34,592 --> 01:49:37,920
Rodger Stone seems fun and is a monster

2188
01:49:41,504 --> 01:49:43,040
Think we could have fun

2189
01:49:43,552 --> 01:49:44,064
Right

2190
01:49:46,624 --> 01:49:48,928
Never ever agree with Rodger Stone on

2191
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:50,720
Any point

2192
01:49:51,488 --> 01:49:52,000
Like big

2193
01:49:52,512 --> 01:49:53,024
Right

2194
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:54,816
It doesn't matter for what we're into

2195
01:49:55,072 --> 01:49:55,584
Interested in cuz

2196
01:49:55,840 --> 01:49:56,608
These things are never go

2197
01:49:56,864 --> 01:50:02,240
Going to happen

2198
01:50:02,496 --> 01:50:04,288
Hey let me give you some advice

2199
01:50:04,544 --> 01:50:07,872
Swear to God I think Rodger Stone would contact us and trying

2200
01:50:08,128 --> 01:50:08,640
Screw us over

2201
01:50:10,944 --> 01:50:14,016
By the time we get big enough for to be on his radar

2202
01:50:14,272 --> 01:50:15,552
We will have to bring a drink

2203
01:50:16,064 --> 01:50:17,600
Is commissary

2204
01:50:18,112 --> 01:50:21,184
Tell videos

2205
01:50:21,952 --> 01:50:22,464
Look

2206
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:28,352
What's a Girl Carrie Callahan goes to a meatza

2207
01:50:28,608 --> 01:50:29,120
You Carrie Callahan

2208
01:50:33,216 --> 01:50:34,240
I don't know they get drunk

2209
01:50:35,264 --> 01:50:35,776
It seems like it

2210
01:50:36,032 --> 01:50:37,312
But I don't know if they actually do

2211
01:50:39,872 --> 01:50:41,920
The real thing here is that

2212
01:50:42,688 --> 01:50:44,736
Whether or not Rodger Stone did anything

2213
01:50:45,504 --> 01:50:47,040
Explicitly illegal

2214
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:49,088
Alex Jones

2215
01:50:49,344 --> 01:50:51,136
Say he did earlier today

2216
01:50:51,392 --> 01:50:52,160
Now he should go

2217
01:50:52,416 --> 01:50:53,184
So we'll see how that were

2218
01:50:53,440 --> 01:50:54,464
Works out

2219
01:50:54,720 --> 01:50:55,232
Ben van Jordan

2220
01:50:55,488 --> 01:50:56,000
But

2221
01:50:57,280 --> 01:50:57,792
You want to find us

2222
01:50:58,560 --> 01:50:59,328
We are at knowledge

01:51:00,352 --> 01:51:01,632
Also

2224
01:51:01,888 --> 01:51:03,936
I'm going to buy a bird by Mark

2225
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:08,800
I don't know baby we'll find out

2226
01:51:15,456 --> 01:51:16,224
On Twitter

2227
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:18,272
Whatever it is you do

2228
01:51:18,528 --> 01:51:21,088
I know what you write up Jordans broad over it

2229
01:51:21,344 --> 01:51:22,624
No don't worry about it

2230
01:51:22,880 --> 01:51:25,440
It's just me threatening which set a new post

2231
01:51:25,696 --> 01:51:26,208
I did

2232
01:51:26,464 --> 01:51:28,768
I took a couple of weeks off because every time

2233
01:51:29,024 --> 01:51:29,536
So I

2234
01:51:30,816 --> 01:51:32,864
Like I wrote about gun control

2235
01:51:34,656 --> 01:51:35,424
I don't know what

2236
01:51:35,936 --> 01:51:37,984
Nearly a year ago

2237
01:51:38,240 --> 01:51:38,752
There's just nothing

2238
01:51:39,008 --> 01:51:39,520
Hangouts to write

2239
01:51:39,776 --> 01:51:41,312
There's no point in

2240
01:51:41,824 --> 01:51:42,336
Continuing

2241
01:51:42,592 --> 01:51:43,872
To say the same thing over

2242
01:51:45,408 --> 01:51:46,432
Have been made

2243
01:51:46,688 --> 01:51:47,712
Now is the time for us

2244
01:51:48,224 --> 01:51:48,736
Just f****** come

2245
01:51:48,992 --> 01:51:51,808
Come together and ignore everybody else and

2246
01:51:53,344 --> 01:51:54,112
Do it

2247
01:51:54,368 --> 01:51:57,184
And until we can do it there's no conversation too

2248
01:51:57,696 --> 01:51:58,720
There's no leg

2249
01:51:59,744 --> 01:52:03,840
Well maybe we should raise the age now we should ban all of these bucket

2250
01:52:04,608 --> 01:52:05,120
That's it

2251
01:52:05,888 --> 01:52:06,400
Problem-solve

2252
01:52:07,168 --> 01:52:09,984
You can also follow us

2253
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:16,896
We got a special group

2254
01:52:19,200 --> 01:52:20,992
Go home and tell your mother in real life

2255
01:52:21,248 --> 01:52:23,040
If you want to do that also

2256
01:52:23,296 --> 01:52:24,064
Good Times all around

2257
01:52:24,576 --> 01:52:25,600
Good Times all around

2258
