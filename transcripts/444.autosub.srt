Interesting Lee paradoxical Brightspot

10
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:18,848
Before we started recording

11
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:20,384
About how

12
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:24,480
I had some trouble with Xfinity

13
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:30,880
I got my papers in or whatever made by request for the transfer of service

14
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,416
And I got the date wrong

15
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:35,744
Answer instead of

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,120
Turned off my internet on Friday night

17
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:47,520
Because I need the internet in order to do the show

18
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:54,176
To the person

19
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:55,968
I had a Zen moment

20
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,504
Like

21
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:02,880
They were a parody of themselves such a bad job with customer service would like

22
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:06,720
Trying to give me what I needed as a customer

23
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:10,048
What is the point why be mad anymore what

24
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:12,608
Why ever why would I yell at this guy

25
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:18,496
Just sucks the shape of the universe

26
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:24,896
All is one and it's all garbage

27
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:28,736
Any decent person who worked there

28
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,928
So I just gave up

29
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:37,952
Fox News

30
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:41,792
I just gave up and last it's all you can do sometime

31
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:44,096
Yep that's basically it

32
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:44,864

Today is both

35
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:55,104
All is one

36
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:08,672
Everybody outside

37
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:13,536
Open mic night playing at the ball

38
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:17,888
There's a lot of backstory there's a lot of boring

39
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,680
But anyways

40
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:26,080
Play with a little tennis ball some stickball bats we have a grand old time song playing in Bucks

41
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,104
Town and

42
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:29,152
Onmilwaukee like

43
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:31,456
Main Street Mill f****** Waukee

44
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:35,040
There was a guy who had strong proud boys

45
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:40,416
Oh I all black pants shirtless with terrible tattoos everywhere

46
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:45,280
Black Bandana for a mask

47
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:49,376
Horrible Bank

48
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:54,496
And he started harassing what look like a middle-aged woman

49
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:56,800
And all in full view of us at

50
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:59,872
There were plenty of people walking by and nobody was f****** do and everything

51
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:06,528
So we wound up running and chasing this dude off your stickball stickball game

52
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,808
Which was

53
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:09,088
Where is the m

54
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,392
That was our responsibility

55
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:17,791
That wasn't like a good deed for the day that was like that's what's expected in society

56
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:28,031
And I didn't get into a fight so I'm not in jail so we can still do the show everything's good

57
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:34,431
Home safely we helped her get into her daughter's car and they everybody was

58
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:51,327
Thursday of last week

59
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,607
Good day

60
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:57,983
This is a bit much

61
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,567
For me

62
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:06,431
Episode I might hit

63
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:08,479
A point where I'm going to express

64
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,039
Alex Jones

65
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:14,623
Like someone needs to

66
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:21,023
This is getting really dangerous

67
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:30,239
So first David B thank you so much juvenile policy want I'm a policy wonk

Appreciate that very much the first of all

74
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,175
What you are now it's

75
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:16,831
And easy spelled a l l y v e r

76
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:17,855
Technocrat

77
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,631
Heroin

78
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,215
Is freakishly large

79
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:51,903
Buttons

80
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:58,303
Bundle it up real nice put some gift wrapping on it and shut it off for a Christmas present today in the middle of June

81
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:02,655
Or a charity in your local area that helps people in need

82
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:04,191
Woodward

83
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:10,591
I wanted to bring something up cuz I got a couple of messages about this

84
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,919
Really helpful for me and I just want to give

85
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:18,527
A correction and slight topology in case this is something

86
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,111
The wrong way

87
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:28,511
I did not realize that I was using the incorrect term for indigenous people in Australia

88
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:32,095
You got on a recent episode

89
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,119
Out-of-date term

90
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,167
For that

91
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:38,495
I just wanted us out and

92
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,775
You know help me

93
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,567
Get a better understanding

94
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:46,943
And it's unfortunate

95
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,479
But it is a reality

96
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:52,063
There's always an opportunity to to here

97
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:58,463
Using his

98
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:04,607
I appreciate people giving me that opportunity and not that you know jumping down my neck

99
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:07,679
You are because

100
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,471
Life is learning

101
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:11,775
Axel and

102
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,567
That I didn't know before

103
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:19,967
Will do better job education system

104
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:24,831
Tearing particularly high on the list of things so

105
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,951
We don't we don't always get the correct everything

106
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:36,351
Start getting into the big narrative

107
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:41,983
Episode top story

108
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:44,543
And God this was a waste of my time

109
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:48,639
New York Undercover nurse confirm covid-19 criminal hoax

110
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:50,431
She's in the epicenter

111
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,223
The epicenter

112
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:58,111
The people didn't have covered and they were putting

113
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,439
Ventilators on the people in

114
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,975
Killing them

115
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,023
She has

116
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,303
The video

117
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:10,911
I'll just tell you that

118
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,983
That's what I'm for serves as is

119
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,263
Incubator

120
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:16,799
Do the research

121
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,127
We put out the Millions

122
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:22,943
Not man

123
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:32,671
So this video that Alex is reporting on was put up

124
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:35,231
Number of red flags

125
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:40,607
Not on this here story

126
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:46,751
Essential content of what she saying

127
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:49,311
Like in the video itself

128
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:55,967
And that's very active making this video that she made is a gigantic breach of patient rights to privacy

129
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:56,735
Yeah that's illegal

130
00:09:56,991 --> 00:10:01,343
This point is something that is very medical professionals at

131
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:04,927
Very very mad

132
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:11,327
The unfortunate reality is that most medical professionals could come forward with horror stories and videos that would scare the s*** out of us

133
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,631
But I can't do to respecting their profession

134
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:17,471
Responsibilities about

135
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:18,239
And work with

136
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:25,151
Aaron decided to videotape people's medical charts and secretly recorded conversations with her colleagues which

137
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:30,271
He's going to get her license revoked

138
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:32,575
At least sued

139
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:36,927
Like it should be I can't imagine there not being legal consequences

140
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:43,583
A lot of the claims that she's making in the video or not supported by the actual video namely that the hospitals are just calling

141
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,631
Everyone covid-19 cases

142
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:48,959
Are knowingly killing people by hooking them up to ventilators

143
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:54,079
And that is only the patients have been given Hydroxycut

144
00:10:54,591 --> 00:11:00,735
Since these claims are not established by her video itself unless to consider whether or not the person making the video

145
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:08,159
Motivation that they're not bringing up to make unfounded claims that I wish

146
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:11,487
Scooby-Doo vomit

147
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,279
So as it happened

148
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:16,607
Zouski

149
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:20,447
In 2018 she founded a group called

150
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:27,871
Wow

151
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:30,175
Get fun

152
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:32,479
Ton of information about this organization

153
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:43,743
Nurses for vaccine safety Alliance

154
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:51,423
She founded nurses and safety Alliance in October 2018

155
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:57,823
2018 nurses for vaccine safety Alliance

156
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:04,223
Does it pay the same entity they realized

157
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,759
Something Bland it's big enough

158
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:12,159
Investigator Jordans

159
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:15,231
Killing your children Without Borders

160
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:21,631
The business address for nurses are vaccine safety Alliance was just a FedEx mailing center in Florida

161
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:28,287
In November 2018 and was a guest on the show called Frieda Miser radio where she gives her bio

162
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,615
But that she quote

Natural Health sector is already

164
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:41,855
Anti-vax message

165
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:44,159
Interest in mainstream nursing or medicine

166
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:50,559
13 super weird that you didn't get involved in a New York Hospital when she's from Florida if she's kind of Apple

167
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:54,655
The type of medicine nobibi practice at this hospital he was going to end

168
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:59,263
Yeah that does Sprint has raised some red flags for me

169
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:05,663

All in a manner of a cup

179
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:44,319
Couple months

180
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,087
Suspicious

181
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:48,415
Nurse from Florida

182
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:51,231
Who responds to New York

Forgive me for sounding a bit jaded but from where I'm sitting this seems like a setup

187
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:12,735
When Alex is saying the Jews on Tucker that night

188
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:16,575
Has nothing to do with Alex covering it and then it's making its way

189
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:20,159
It's just the latest

190
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:22,975
Attack

191
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:27,327
Ecosystem

192
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:33,727
Plan to take credit for it

193
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:39,359
I was thinking about this I realized like Alex is in a weird position now where he doesn't really have a purpose

194
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,151
Like

195
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:47,295
Tucker doesn't need Alex to mainstream narratives for him anymore

196
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:50,367
Picked up on that thing about George Floyd

197
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,415
That's pointless

198
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,439
I get the awful and it's

199
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,207
Disgusting

200
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,231
See Alex's

201
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:57,791
But like

202
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:01,887
The big guy is like Tucker and Sean Hannity don't need Alex a Tucker's just

203
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,727
Out there

204
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:12,127
He could just take like people are coming for you Deaconess star on his show

205
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:18,527
Show have this doctor on

206
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:24,927
He's not useful to the internet anymore they don't need him to like amplify their messages

207
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,207
He has no use

208
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:31,327
It's a bummer but away from

209
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:35,167
I would like the only way that you would have any value as if he was

210
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,703
Outside of that ecos

211
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,239
Exist

212
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:43,103
And it can propagate without him entirely a remarkable person to like

213
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,407
Go on another path

214
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:50,783
Like that to do the things he does but for like

215
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,319
Not Trump

216
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:58,975
I don't know what that would be it would not be him trying to do the Glenn Beck I'm sorry about all that

217
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:05,119
I wouldn't happen I would not accept that you just like try to pave it into like

218
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:09,983
Completely other territory

219
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:11,007
That are like

220
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:16,383
The other people's conspiracy theories

221
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:24,831
I said that I'll leave my V

222
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:31,231
Super simple

223
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:38,399
This is a big story The Big narrative on this episode it's a large portion

224
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:39,679
Locks

225
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,215
Of this video

226
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:45,055
And in order to understand

227
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:46,591
A video and it's trash

228
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:50,943
But it's it's basically what Alex is preoccupied with

229
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,271
And it because this video is so extreme

230
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:56,319
It makes Alex need to be

231
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,391
This is such

232
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,207
Exercise app

233
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,791
That if people don't hang for the

234
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:09,631
Politically

235
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:14,495
Because you did

236
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:15,775
Testing

237
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:16,799
Face

238
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,615
About being

239
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,671
We put up with this

240
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:34,975
The message here I think is pretty clear

241
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:39,839
Are you talkin about that video that Aronofsky put out

242
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:44,703
Fully proved at the Coronavirus

243
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:50,591
And that medical doctors are actively killing people in order to get numbers up high enough to appear to be a pandemic

244
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:52,127
That's what he's talking about

245
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:58,527
Essentially Ellington putting forth the most vast conspiracy imaginable involving literally all the doctors and nurse

246
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:01,599
Hospital Calais other individuals

247
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:04,927
All conspired together to pull off a fake pandemic for some reason

248
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:09,791
This is nonsense information is put forth on the subject

249
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:14,911
Inclusive to honestly feels more like a person trying to buzz Market their new book

250
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:17,471
There's absolutely no way that anyone is

251
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:20,287
For whatever conspiracy

252
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,567
Proven

253
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:24,383
Because he and his resources are all making it up

254
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:27,455
Anthony fauci

255
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:29,247
The Coronavirus

256
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:31,551
It's just Alex's fantasy

257
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:37,951
This is what Alex has demanded this doesn't happen then the blood is on all of Alice's audiences

258
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:38,719
Pants

259
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:42,047
Alex is making his listeners guilty for the eventual deaths

260
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:45,887
The come from covid-19

261
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:48,959
You can easily see how this is an incitement to violence

262
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:54,847
Businessman saying that if these people has decided are guilty of running a fake pandemic

263
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:58,431
Responsible for the deaths that

264
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:00,735
You don't want to be responsible for all those deaths

265
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:04,063
Well maybe you should take matters into your own hands to keep blood off

266
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:07,391
This is profound dangerous mentality to push

267
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:18,399
One of the things that makes it most dangerous is that

268
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:21,727
He's not just talking about people like that

269
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:26,847
He's talkin about all these doctors and unnamed nurses at various hospitals

270
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:32,735
Part of our house keys video is a legend the doctors in the hospitals were killing patient

271
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:35,551
And that's what I was just talking about a nightclub I just played

272
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,343
He's calling for the hangings

273
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:40,671
Countless medical professionals around the country and if it doesn't happen

274
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:42,975
Has that blood on their hands

275
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:48,863
You'll be really hard to get a unhinged person to attack a Mac Tower

276
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:51,679
Alex's Vengeance ultimate like starchy or Bill Gates

277
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:53,983
Ruby less difficult to attack a hospital

278
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:56,287
And this is a real serious threat right now

279
00:19:57,055 --> 00:20:00,639
On March 24th the FBI tried to arrest a man named Timothy Wilson

280
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:03,199
Haven't had him under investigation for 6 months

281
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:07,551
Wilson was a white supremacist who had decided to Baba hospital because of quote

282
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:10,111
The increased impact given the immediate

283
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,647
Tension in the health sector

284
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:16,255
On March 24th you met up with an undercover officer think he was picking up a bomb

285
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:20,607
And when the off the arrest started he initiated a shootout result

286
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,167
This is not an isolated it's

287
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:27,519
On May 11th Saint Helena Hospital in Napa Valley had to be evacuated

288
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:28,543
A bomb threat

289
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:34,687
On June 9th the 33-year old man named Robert Roden arrived at Stony Brook Hospital in New York quotes

290
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:38,015
Wearing a tactical vest and carrying operable homemade bomb

291
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:39,039
A BB gun

292
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:39,807
Hatchet and

293
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:40,831
Handcuffs

294
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:45,439
On June 11th someone called in a bomb threat to the University of Illinois hospital

295
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,463
You're in Chicago

296
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:48,511
Again having to shut down the building

297
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:49,535
. of time

298
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:50,559
Grapes

299
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:53,887
There's a seriousness of this issue that

300
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:58,495
That takes this kind of rhetoric

301
00:20:58,751 --> 00:20:59,775
Conspiracy theorist into

302
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:02,847
Guy who has a considerable chance of getting people killed

303
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:04,383
This kind of nonsense

304
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:08,735
This video that I was just covering is a blatant piece of s***

305
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:10,015
Propaganda nonsense

306
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:12,831
And the shifted it represents is terrifying

307
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:18,720
InStep take name of the faceless big Pharma the nebulous idea of the globalist to push vaccines

308
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:21,536
This video takes aim at the Frontline doctors

309
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:24,608
Nurses and other healthcare workers

310
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:25,376
The tree people

311
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:29,472
Is a very serious escalation and I really worry about what it pretends

312
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,544
Take this narrative from here

313
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:35,104
Whatever happens Alex is playing with fire

314
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:39,968
Absolutely inexcusable no matter what the consequences come

315
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:41,504
The possibility of

316
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,784
Go to be created

317
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,320
With that is just like

318
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:45,600
Why would you do that

319
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:47,392
Why would you do this

320
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:54,560
It is one of those things where you say you could pivot away from somewhere else but it's like it

321
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:55,840
You can't have him

322
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:58,656
Like is that rhetoric

323
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:03,776
Could could be applied in some ways to the situation wherein from

324
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:04,544
From the reverse

325
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:10,944
Trump is doing all of this b******* that is all of these people reopening the country all of this stuff

326
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,808
Is going to get more people killed all of these white supremacist going around f****** people up

327
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:18,624
Call Bob

328
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,696
They're f****** people up and Alex Jones on that sound

329
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:28,096
The other direction would be saying if you don't kill a white supremacist you got their blood

330
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:35,264
And that's not how you solve any problem that's not what you do and it's bra no calling

331
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:38,848
Defunding the police

332
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:39,872
Discussions

333
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:41,152
Anybody

334
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:43,712
If there was anybody who was like

335
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:44,736
Relative

336
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:47,040
Stature of Alex Jones

337
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:50,880
Calling for murdering cops

338
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:55,488
Absolutely

339
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:58,048
I just don't understand

340
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,120
Get what he's doing he's doing it again

341
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:03,680
Like this is the same sort of behavior

342
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:06,496
But he's engaged in that is got him into trouble

343
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:11,360
Yeah I mean this is the same thing as

344
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:13,408
You know what they say

345
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:15,456
Incitement

346
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,224
These

347
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:21,088
You know people calling and threatening

348
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:21,856
Their lives

349
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:25,440
Over it it's the same behavior I don't understand

350
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,976
He doesn't

351
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:28,768
You say he has to understand

352
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:29,792
Probably

353
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:32,096
But it's just locked up like

354
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:34,144
Isle of Corsica

355
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:38,240
That's what that's what he and his ilk get the f*** off on is

356
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:39,520
Fantasies of

357
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,288
Hurting people

358
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,568
Of murdering p

359
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,128
And so these just expressing his Phantom

360
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,456
The end result of his fantasy is

361
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,480
Is people dying

362
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,528
So he has to know what he's do

363
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:55,392
But he thinks he's on the right side of things because

364
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:56,160
The doctors

365
00:23:56,672 --> 00:24:00,000
View

366
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:01,536
There have been hundreds of men

367
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:03,840
Let him come out

368
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:04,608
And you're ugly.

369
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,008
University

370
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:17,152
Cedars-Sinai

371
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,688
Clinic owners

372
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:23,040
We're having a normal amount of death for Steve

373
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:28,160
Pneumonia

374
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,048
Testing the main testing

375
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:35,840
The broad

376
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:45,312
Employment references

377
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:48,640
Every specific instance

378
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:51,712
But he's brought up and I could just like maybe 5

379
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:58,112
Yeah couple of a chiropractors sure they count clinical like the guys who run the Urgent Care

380
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:59,904
Clinic in Bakersfield

381
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,184
There's like

382
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,744
Judy mikovits plandemic

383
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,280
Stairs not like

384
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:08,352
The list goes on is over now

385
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:13,984
My guess is

386
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,824
The head of the Rockefeller Hospital Cedars-Sinai as one of his

387
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:20,896
This is a case of Alex mixing up his narrative

388
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:27,296
Cedar-Sinai supposed to be part of his Trump was right to suggest injecting disinfectants into people talking point

389
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:30,368
Which has nothing to do with the covid-19 denialism

390
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,976
Does grasping at straws anything close to the medical field

391
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:37,792
And in doing so you can see how you're no grass

392
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:38,816
Or even his own

393
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:39,584
Conspiracy theory

394
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:43,424
Everybody knows the Rockefeller Hospital only serves Rock

395
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:50,080
Not even people in the family just anybody with the name Rockefeller

396
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:52,128
That's the only one

397
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,688
I'm trying to think of another non Rockefeller Rockefeller

398
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,808
Jay Rockefeller sure he was

399
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:03,648
So don't so they're not happening currently

400
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:07,232
They're very well maybe a normal number of that's coming from the flu

401
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,512
These are covid-19

402
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:14,912
There's a very widespread phenomenon of excess deaths that Alex has not given an explanation for it

403
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:21,056
Just decided to deny

404
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:24,384
Almost entirely fictional realities presented to the audience

405
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,456
Yeah you know

406
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:29,248
Active Island

407
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,528
To try and get people killed

408
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:34,624
Passively by make sure to make Northern

409
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:41,024
Gates links the Seattle coronavirus assessment Network wasn't shut down because

410
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,584
As a fraud it was a temporary closure over a text

411
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,168
Macavity about them being queer to release test results to civilian

412
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:54,080
Already gotten State approval but the federal government put a hold on their program cuz they said they needed Federal approval as well

413
00:26:55,104 --> 00:27:00,736
A little update

414
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:02,016
Haven't found around

415
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:08,928
They're still working with the FDA to be granted full Federal approval for the release of results but in the meantime they submitted to a review

416
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:15,328
You bored with the University of Washington and the Seattle Children's and Fred Hutchinson cancer research center

417
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:16,096
Which has

418
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:19,936
Offered to provide oversight and implement this program as a study

419
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:23,520
Running this as a review board approved study allows for the test

420
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:26,080
To be processed without Federal approval but again

421
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:27,616
They are also still working

422
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:29,408
To get that Federal approval

423
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:35,808
Time is of the essence of something like this so they're they're working proceed and they can also follow appropriate after

424
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:36,576
Ba stock

425
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:40,160
I was just making up that they were shut down for fraud because he's making all of the

426
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:46,048
This up his story has no connection to reality and he doesn't even remember what words mean in terms of ozone conspiracy

427
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:48,864
Fucken pathetic giving him way too much credit

428
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,656
I don't think he remembers what words

429
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,704
That's fine

430
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:59,104
Situation with this New York nurse

431
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,432
The bad

432
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:18,816
Videos

433
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:21,120
Computers

434
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:23,680
Operatories

435
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:27,520
In the room showing

436
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:32,128
People

437
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,064
Run

438
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:56,448
They turn the hospital today executions

439
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:59,520
I want my watch Darren's video m

440
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:02,080
Immediate problems

441
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:09,504
First one of her patients charts on her cellphone and showing it to the camera

442
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:13,856
The person's name is very sloppy but I would bet just about anything

443
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:15,648
Very easy to unblur that with

444
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:17,184
Minimal amounts of Photoshop

445
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,208
Which strikes me as

446
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:19,232
Very response

447
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:21,792
It's really sloppy as a redaction

448
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:28,704
Then about five and a half minutes and they show some undercover footage that Aaron got where she's

449
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:31,008
Confirm covid-19

450
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:34,080
Test in the charts no traces found

451
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:40,992
This is a problem because based on everything we is viewers have been shown this isn't that same person

452
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:44,064
Chart from her cell phone

453
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,904
Eureka diesel one person that she's talking about

454
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:54,304
And there could be an explanation for this like for instance the doctors were worried that this was a case with a false

455
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,328
Negative result

456
00:29:55,584 --> 00:30:00,704
Symptoms of covid-19

457
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:05,824
Without more information we don't know what the circumstances are here and it's just sloppy work

458
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:11,456
To make matters worse

459
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:17,856
The game of secret cameras

460
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:18,624
A+

461
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:23,488
The video was edited to end just before the other nurse gives her answer which is super suspicious

462
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,280
It almost makes you think

463
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:31,424
Maybe there was an answer that made sense but it completely blue

464
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,704
Forward so they just cut it out

465
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:33,984
That might be

466
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,032
What it is because I mean

467
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:37,056
Yeah

468
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:38,592
I can see

469
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:44,736
Possibility where the test came back negative

470
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:47,552
We're going to go ahead and assume moving forward

471
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:49,088
Hey because

472
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:56,000
I don't see what you don't know anymore about it other than you and also what is it is no traces found

473
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:57,792
Directly linked covid

474
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:04,704
Does it say you were stupid stupid you don't know alcohol

475
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:12,384
Far afield

476
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:18,784
I watched your video but my desire to discuss it fell apart really quickly

477
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:23,648
I think this would be a fantastic opportunity for the hospital and the other staff to sue the s*** out of

478
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:28,768
If he's willing to put out this kind of a stunt in a YouTube video

479
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:35,424
Is there a serious about that she wouldn't have released it as a suspiciously edited YouTube video full of claims she doesn't prove right

480
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,704
Right before her tell-all book

481
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,520
Comes out to file the lawsuit against the hospital

482
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:41,056
Or something along those lines

483
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:43,360
She's literally accusing people of murder

484
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:46,688
The shooting YouTube videos not the place to do that if you mean it

485
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,248
If you really are serious about this

486
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:50,784
And you should be

487
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,832
Taking action in that front

488
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:54,112
As opposed to

489
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:56,160
Whatever this is

490
00:31:56,416 --> 00:32:02,560
Uncover a massive conspiracy to purposefully kill patient

491
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:06,912
Right course of action

492
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:09,984
A bunch of claims that you make Cinavia the sound

493
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,264
Until you look for contacts

494
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:16,896
Princeton she claims that everything was crazy in the hospital there was a dentist in charge of the ICU

495
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:22,272
A fellow practitioner at the hospital clarify

496
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:25,088
The dentist an ophthalmologist working in the iso use

497
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:26,624
They have a defined role

498
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,464
Their medical professionals that space-time family members at bedside

499
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,744
They're not treating

500
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:38,144
They're an extension of the nursing staff so we can provide more time caring for a patient with less time answering phone calls

501
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:43,264
That's suspiciously not brought up in Aaron because the videos a lot of s***

502
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:49,664
You can find some accounts from other people who are at the hospital she was at but of course

503
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,200
So they can't discuss patient

504
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:55,040
The camp is Express how much things like this video

505
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:59,136
One fellow nurse at Elmhurst at the hospital she was at

506
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:05,280
Express the level of betrayal hurt doubt your disgust and anger is something I cannot put into words

507
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:09,888
Working at a level 1 Trauma Center in a hurricane prevalent area I came to Elmhurst

508
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,936
To give the regular staff some reprieve

509
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:12,960
A fresh face

510
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:14,752
A skill a strong skill set

511
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:16,800
Answer answer by nursing of

512
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:20,384
I thought others did too and man did this wonders prove me wrong

513
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:22,176
We were welcomed with open arms

514
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:22,944
An Air Hogs

515
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:26,784
Put simply I believe that you can sell their message up is gofucker

516
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:27,808
Yourself Aaron

517
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:32,672
This is ridiculous message up with

518
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:35,744
Doctors murderer

519
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:38,304
To be clear

520
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,888
Don't do this on a YouTube video

521
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:44,448
If you mean this don't do this

522
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:48,544
Amazingly ridiculous

523
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:50,336
Even accepting of that

524
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:52,128
Is a weird thing to imagine

525
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:53,664
But whatever

526
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:57,504
Alex gets into

527
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,832
You can tell from

528
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:02,368
You know her past

529
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,952
Movements it's probably the large

530
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:09,024
Part of what's this is a desire to

531
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,304
You know work against

532
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:16,704
Potential coronavirus vaccine development

533
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:21,824
That's not necessarily super explicit in the actual video

534
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:26,944
But if you listen to Alex's coverage of it becomes totally clean

535
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:30,784
At the mall

536
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:47,680
You understand when they give preemies back

537
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:54,336
So a couple things real quick

538
00:34:54,848 --> 00:35:00,992
It's widely known medical reality that premature babies are at a greater risk of diseases which are preventable with vaccine

539
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:02,528
Call

540
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:04,320
And I know McCorkle disease

541
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:11,488
Premature babies are a position where they are at a higher risk if they are not vaccinated

542
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:18,144
Most vaccines are supposed to be administered to premature births at the same schedule as their full term term counterparts

543
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,192
With couple exceptions like rotavirus

544
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:25,312
They require slightly different schedule but people understand that

545
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:31,456
Mystikal round about being inappropriate dangerous to vaccinate premature babies

546
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,224
Compliances

547
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:32,992
McKay's

548
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:38,368
It comes from ideas about a child's immune system not being fully developed in the gestational.

549
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:41,184
But this turns out to not be as big a deal as it might appear

550
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:46,560
A 2015 analysis in the journal human vaccines and immunotherapy

551
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:51,424
Well absolute primary antibody responses may be lower in preterm compared to

552
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,216
Intermittence vaccinated

553
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:54,496
Chronological age

554
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:57,056
Chief antibody concentration

555
00:35:57,312 --> 00:36:00,384
Higher than levels generally accepted to be to correlate with

556
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,784
I can buy there's any increased mortality risk related to premature babies being vaccinated

557
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,320
Definitely no evidence that

558
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:09,600
Half of them died

559
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:11,904
Completely absurd and honestly

560
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,208
The opposite is closer to reality

561
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:18,560
Due to the increased danger that vaccine-preventable diseases pose to premature birth

562
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:22,144
Not vaccinating them is probably far more likely to lead to death then backs

563
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:25,728
If you pay close attention do like I said you can see the game

564
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:30,080
Full coverage the undercover video supposed covid-19

565
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:34,688
Covid-19 better hold these doctors responsible for their alleged

566
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:36,224
Promote

567
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,248
Zacks narrative

568
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,320
And you can see how Alex Instinct through insta to announce that

569
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:45,440
He goes from this video and smoothly transitions into an attack on texting because that's what this is all about

570
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:46,208
He gets it

571
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:48,000
You can tell

572
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:51,584
I just I just don't understand the confidence

573
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:53,376
I just don't get that

574
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:54,144
Level oven

575
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,680
Same confidence to be like

576
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:58,496
Like I know how big Medical

577
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:01,568
True you know and I haven't read

578
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:04,640
And doctors have read a lot of them

579
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:09,248
I don't know what the confidence of somebody who's not read any of those textbooks and is just like

580
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:15,648
Girl long they don't know a f****** thing about this

581
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:20,000
Doctor

582
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:21,536
I mean

583
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:24,352
Let's Trista Ludacris

584
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:27,424
One of those sites that I was looking at Within

585
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,240
Approximately 10% of births are premature

586
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:35,616
Half of the babies who are vaccinated

587
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:42,016
Alex

588
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:45,344
Finally to talking about the Capitol Hill autonomous Zone

589
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:53,536
Views it as a Libertarian space wearing

590
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:58,656
And they're treating it as though

591
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:00,448
No there's no laws

592
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:05,312
Picture of sovereign citizen paradise and slightly different timeline

593
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:12,480
You didn't spend a lot of time talking about the zone

594
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:13,504
Just has one

595
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:17,088
Demigod

596
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,976
Enlarged heart

597
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:24,256
Describe

598
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:37,312
Running around beating

599
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:38,080
People

600
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,384
Calling himself in it

601
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:45,504
So

602
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:51,904
Seattle Police Department

603
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:59,584
So he's talked about the Capitol Hill autonomous Zone the protester to set up in Seattle

604
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:05,728
It's this guy 1 police station that the police vacated which is now Community Center at

605
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:06,496
I need directions

606
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:13,152
I have no idea about the inner workings of what's going on there nor can I pretend to know what's going to happen with it in the future but from

607
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:16,992
All external appearances it seems interesting

608
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:22,112
People feeding folks for no charge

609
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:24,160
Kind of block party

610
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:27,744
Set up the block vehicle traffic

611
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,120
So the cops can't get into something that probably is a scary

612
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:37,216
All-in on the malheur Wildlife Refuge

613
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:37,984
Yeah

614
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:44,640
Nothing is without the

615
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:46,176
The cops they're fine

616
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:51,808
Like that is a really threatening idea that if there are no cops and everybody is fine

617
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:54,624
Maybe not getting as violent as otherwise

618
00:39:54,880 --> 00:40:01,024
It really really ruins your job

619
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:06,400
Try to look into this seeing some reporting from there and I seen

620
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:12,032
The / get is that but I also don't want to commit too hard in case

621
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:18,176
There's a perception problem that's going on

622
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:26,112
From people who

623
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:37,632
From Chicago it's difficult for me to tell

624
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:42,752
Exactly what's the reality of it

625
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:47,360
F****** complicated even if you're there and in invest in it

626
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:49,920
I can't imagine it being the sort of thing where you could be like

627
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:54,528
Well here's what's going on one sentence

628
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:55,552
No matter how many

629
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:57,088
Videos I watch on

630
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:58,368
Twitter about the

631
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,392
I'm not going to get there

632
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:00,672
A clear picture of yak

633
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:01,440
Probably not

634
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:08,096
Activist named Raz Simone

635
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:10,656
He carries his permit on

636
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:20,384
Videos of Simone approaching an individual graffiti up on a building which is apparently a home or workplace

637
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:29,600
Tri-State explain to him that the business is nice enough to let people be there in the autonomous Zone and they quote we are the cop

638
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:36,768
Saying that he and his team

639
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:41,120
The absence of cops there everyone has their own responsibility

640
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:41,888
To the community

641
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,192
A fight does seem to break out but it's

642
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:49,824
Pretty clearly the guy was spray painting was the aggressor and making the situation escalated

643
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:53,663
This mode appears to be trying to get the guy to respect the person

644
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:55,455
Property metallic should be into

645
00:41:57,503 --> 00:42:02,367
It's really hard to tell from the footage but it appears that it was the spray painter who's the person who makes it

646
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:06,719
Portrayed it as a like

647
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:08,255
Reply

648
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:11,839
This actually went beautifully and we all hugged it out and spoke with his dad

649
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:13,887
Is that that wants me to Mentor him

650
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:18,239
It was great black dialogue and men apologizing to each other abandoning Pride

651
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:24,639
We all hugged each other cried it out and it was beautiful

652
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:28,479
Video it's just what he saying

653
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:34,879
I don't have any reason to doubt him but I can't prove that is the end result of it

654
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:38,463
He's lost a hand then I will accept the African

655
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:43,839
Whatever your perspective is on the autonomous Zone absolutely an unfair characterization

656
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:50,239
Characterization is

657
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:53,055
Racialized characterization

658
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:55,871
Denny's weaponizing it to scare right-wing audience

659
00:42:56,383 --> 00:43:02,527
African Warlord

660
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:05,087
Seattle

661
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:09,951
For Christ's sake in 2016 he was opening for Macklemore

662
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:14,047
Exactly and that's how you know

663
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:20,703
I can understand this is long form birth certificate I can understand some people having a people occupy

664
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:23,519
A couple blocks in a major US

665
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:24,287
Is too much

666
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:26,591
This is racist incitement which is ironic

667
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:33,759
What happens when people fight back

668
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,439
Fair enough

669
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:43,231
Is pretty preoccupied

670
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:46,047
A little bit more about it

671
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:50,911
Sector the city

672
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:52,447
And if it does not do that

673
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:55,263
Did not appoint anybody

674
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:57,311
Appointment

675
00:43:58,591 --> 00:43:59,103
Bistro

676
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:05,247
Quote

677
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:15,231
God

678
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:23,935
Further Raz Simone is not the leader of the autonomous Zone and he's not the life of God

679
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:25,471
Is a fun game for Alex

680
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:29,311
Dial up his audiences racist Peters but it's not real at all

681
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:30,591
Also

682
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:37,247
His most recent release with a song called Shoot at everyone

683
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:41,599
It's a song about how much pain he feels largely about estrangement from his

684
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:43,135
The course begins quote

685
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:45,439
See there's a pain that I feel in my heart that

686
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:46,463
Can't be numb

687
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:48,255
Sometimes I want to shoot at everyone

688
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:52,863
Not the best song ever but honestly pretty good I enjoyed it

689
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:53,631
Edsby

690
00:44:53,887 --> 00:45:00,031
Artist is involved in something that's not music

691
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:03,359
I found it a lot of the times I end up being disappointed

692
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:05,663
Twice

693
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:10,015
If that gives you any indication rarely listen to songs

694
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:16,415
Trying to present this as a threat that Simone is thinking about things

695
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:22,047
April

696
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:27,935
This was

697
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:32,031
This is almost a purity level of Alex trying to create a black Boogeyman

698
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:41,247
Media is like really

699
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:44,063
Find in Skyrim

700
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:45,855
Found Lee racist stuff

701
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:48,927
He plays like the like a video

702
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:54,815
Music video of Raz Simone where he's like

703
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:59,935
Surprising all of this of any context in order to frighten old white

704
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:03,519
Alex might as well be like

705
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:05,823
He said

706
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:21,439
Steals his phone

707
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:31,167
Not sure about that

708
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:36,287
I've ever seen for reparation

709
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:42,687
Smug snarky little look on his face like he likes like

710
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:43,711
31

711
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:50,111
Steph Curry did a little stand-up

712
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:54,463
Perfect response to somebody and you make a little

713
00:46:57,535 --> 00:46:59,583
I fucken improv the best line

714
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:01,631
He's got

715
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:03,935
This is where things get really interesting and

716
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:09,055
I will say that watching Aaron's nurse video with a waste of an hour of my time

717
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:11,359
This was also a huge waste of my time

718
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:13,151
Super King

719
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:16,991
Confused because you need to hear what

720
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:17,759
Confused me

721
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:20,319
Authorized

722
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:22,111
Bill's phone

Society

724
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:40,031
Appeasement

725
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:44,639
Weird that something was cut out

726
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:46,175
Feed

727
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:53,343
Okay so you probably something like that

728
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:57,439
Because the audio feeds that I get are generally like genesis

729
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:05,375
And so whenever those broadcast on whatever

730
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:07,423
They got to cut that stuff out

731
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:09,215
So I went and I looked

732
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:12,799
For Alex's version on video

733
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:19,199
I was like what do you know what are we what are we got here here's what it is on HBO

734
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:22,015
He says that's not authorized so he beats them up

735
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:23,551
Steals his phone

736
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:25,599
As reparation

737
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:29,183
Make it up because

738
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:30,207
Cuz the good people

739
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:32,255
Won't stand up and say no

740
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:36,095
Call everyone you know because we're all out here

741
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:36,863
Today

742
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:39,167
There's even cut out of this version

743
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:41,727
But also they added a weird flash effect

744
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:44,031
Like to try and cover up the video

745
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:48,383
Something is really up here and Alex said something that they needed to bury

746
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:55,039
Whatever

747
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:55,807
This time

748
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:59,391
He had his team cut out something

749
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:06,815
Personally cut out on a limb

750
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:11,167
The Edward was dropped deliberately I thought that was a chance

751
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:13,215
Or he said something

752
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:15,007
Like to f***** up

753
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:21,663
And honestly I managed to find it you know I don't give up on things like this

754
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:25,759
Virgin of the.

755
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:28,319
I've ever been

756
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:29,599
The real world

757
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:32,159
He catches some antifa God tagging

758
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:34,975
He says that's not authorized so he beats them up

759
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:36,511
And steals his phone

760
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:38,559
As reparation

761
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:42,143
Make it up because

762
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:43,167
Is the good people

763
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:44,959
Stand up and say no

764
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:46,239
The very worst

765
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:49,823
Ends up ruling

766
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:51,103
ValuJet Warlords

767
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:52,127
That's how you get

768
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:53,151
Collapse of society

769
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:54,175
Is a piece

770
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:58,271
Chipotle

771
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:00,319
Today

772
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:06,719
Interesting situation because I don't feel like it's Clippers anymore

773
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:11,327
A conscious decision was made not only by

774
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:15,679
But also by Genesis Communications Network to cut that part out of the show

775
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:17,727
I don't know exactly what's up

776
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:24,895
So I consider the possibility that there's some kind of recording problem

777
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:28,479
It's perfect. No problem at all

778
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:30,783
The decision to cut that portion out

779
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:32,319
Was intentional

780
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:34,879
I think I know

781
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:35,647
Nixon

782
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:42,047
If you watch the video Alex makes that snarky reparations joke that's not actually

783
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:46,655
Based on anything except his racist

784
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:53,311
All expenses of the good people and gestures with both hands at himself

785
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:56,895
These good people don't stand up worst

786
00:50:57,663 --> 00:50:58,687
Penny Trails off

787
00:50:59,199 --> 00:50:59,711
You just

788
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:04,319
String towards the video screen which is playing the visuals of one of Razz's music

789
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:07,135
With his hand making it okay sign

790
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:08,927
When he says the very worst

791
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:13,791
It seems clear to me that someone was in his ear because there was a look of confusion on Alex's

792
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:14,559
Does face

793
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:16,863
It looks like he's trying to take in information which

794
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:17,631
Make sense

795
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:19,935
What are the producers

796
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:23,007
Pics of this or a disaster needs to bail right now

797
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:26,335
I don't know if the okay sign is intentional as like a whites

798
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:32,735
Supremacist think on his own platform

799
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:36,319
We have some sort of Suspicion about what could this has been about

800
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:38,367
I have no idea if this is the case

801
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:41,439
Like I'm just spitballing here I'm just guessing

802
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:45,791
What happened with the while they were in Oz

803
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:50,655
Would you explain that

804
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:53,983
You know on the Jensen

805
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:55,263
Just got them hard

806
00:51:55,519 --> 00:52:01,663
Look like nothing could happen

807
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:05,503
For the first video

808
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:11,903
That was what happened I don't know what it is like I know like Alex is saying the good people and gesturing at himself

809
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:16,767
The very worst

810
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:25,727
I mean that's racist vicious racist but that doesn't seem outside of his own

811
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:27,775
Cut that out

812
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:37,759
Maybe they've even figured out that Alex should just cut it at

813
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:44,415
We're just trying to take little jumps in time for me to sort out

814
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:53,119
Nakiryu were predicting is going to drop an bombs I thought they were probably something at least like

815
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:55,935
I mean I don't know some sort of a slur

816
00:52:57,215 --> 00:53:03,359
It is it is expensive

817
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:12,575
I meant to shelve the show

818
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:18,975
Penny I don't understand

819
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:22,047
I'm telling you right now

820
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:24,095
Pot commitment is a fallacy

821
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:25,631
You're never

822
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:28,703
Now that doesn't make any Colossus doesn't make any sense

823
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:34,079
Alex

824
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:36,895
He's going to talk about Bill Gates

825
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:43,295
Kilkenny

826
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:58,143
The weaponized

827
00:53:58,655 --> 00:53:59,167
Operation

828
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:03,775
The whole recipe

829
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:09,151
Interrupt

830
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:10,431
The medical facility

831
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:19,135
This is how you said

832
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:19,903
People

833
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:25,023
Tabletop exercises

834
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:27,071
10 years ago

835
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:32,447
Because

836
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:38,847
And then also I wanted to demonstrate this is kind of Alex's new version of a narrative now that this nurse

837
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:42,431
Who's come out with her videos

838
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:48,831
Now Alex is working in this whole thing about the globalist corrupt all the doctor so they can speak out against

839
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:49,855
Beattyville plants

840
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:56,767
This is a really important piece of any conspiracy theory which is the explanation for why there aren't hundreds of people confirming what your sore

841
00:54:57,023 --> 00:55:00,863
Sources are claiming and what you think you've proven

842
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:10,335
You get the doctors to kill people and then they can't talk up because they're in on it now it's like a

843
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:16,735
Getting guy kill someone to get in a gang Stasek Ali is busy

844
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:26,463
So I mean Alex has got a bunch of sketchy looking sources to back up his claims and the rest of it is basically just make

845
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:30,559
If any of that was real

846
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:31,583
Calling

847
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:34,143
Doctors and nurses do not want to kill you

848
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:35,167
It's the opposite

849
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:39,775
Something feels like you shouldn't have to say that out loud

850
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:40,543
Yeah

851
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:43,615
But there was something even close to it Alex is describing happening

852
00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:50,015
Being your unimaginably large number of healthcare professionals coming forward as opposed to just one alternative health nurse

853
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:54,111
Who founded to promote a book

854
00:55:54,879 --> 00:55:58,975
Also lockstep wasn't a drill or a tabletop exercise wasn't even a plan

855
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:01,535
One of four scenarios it was imagined as a way to

856
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:07,423
Conceive ways the technological advancement particular

857
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:08,447
In the coming years

858
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:13,823
Actual paper and is it lying about it being the plant because he is a huge liar

859
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:22,783
You can't be like all that is that Bill Gates plan to kill Granny and all that s*** whenever 2 months ago

860
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:24,319
Mary lieutenant governor

861
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:26,111
Old people should go to work and die

862
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:32,255
Nothing else but you can't have it

863
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:34,047
Exactly

864
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:35,071
Yes

865
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:39,423
Tonight

866
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:45,567
Assessment

867
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:50,431
Is a drill

868
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:52,735
There's going to be new chimera

869
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:01,439
This is kind of a drill

870
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:02,207
This is just

871
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:02,975
Event

872
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:03,999
1

873
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:05,279
The big events coming

874
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:15,519
So first of all Bill Gates doesn't have a vaccine for this

875
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:19,871
This is all just stuff that Alex took from a chicken vaccine patent

876
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:22,431
Which Ed receive some

877
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:27,551
I was just lifted this narrative from qanon posters online is accepted it is real

878
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:29,087
Repulsion

879
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:31,647
Bill Gates did not say on Colbert

880
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:32,927
Coronavirus situation

881
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:33,695
Is just a drill

882
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:35,743
He's coming for a little bit

883
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:38,303
What's than that right now

884
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:40,095
Quiltville

885
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:42,655
You try to warn us

886
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:43,423
About

887
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:47,519
What's the name

888
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:49,311
It's about

889
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:50,847
In five years

890
00:57:59,295 --> 00:58:01,087
I understand I send you one

891
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:02,623
Everybody lose

892
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:03,391
Nobody wins

893
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:07,743
I'm just saying

894
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:09,791
What else are we not listen

895
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:11,583
Take action on

896
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:13,375
Well

897
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:15,935
The idea of a

898
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:17,215
A biotech

899
00:58:24,383 --> 00:58:24,895
Okay

900
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:30,271
Going to do

901
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:31,295
To be ready

902
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:34,879
1

903
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:35,647
Most

904
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:37,695
Are also

905
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:49,215
Is that coming on The Tonight Show

906
00:58:56,383 --> 00:58:57,407
It's always important

907
00:58:57,663 --> 00:58:58,943
Constantly remind yourself of that

908
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:05,087
He takes a clip like this from Colbert interview and writes his own story

909
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:07,135
Is not someone who lives in reality

910
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:08,671
He's making all this s*** up

911
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:11,487
How to get mad at Colbert

912
00:59:11,743 --> 00:59:12,255
Don't say

913
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:13,535
Weeden

914
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:19,167
Listen we had a whole f****** 79-page plan

915
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:23,519
CDC had a whole thing they listen they had the whole thing ready

916
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:28,127
Ready to go with the Royal we

917
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:32,735
Cleanser it's pretty funny

918
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:35,295
Bragi

919
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:41,439
You're making it up

920
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:52,959
Tattoo I'm not mad at

921
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:53,727
The crew

922
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:55,519
Formulaic

923
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:57,311
The movie Annie

924
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:00,639
So obvious

925
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:02,943
You're watching

926
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:04,735
It's a good guy

927
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:08,319
Still waiting on that.

928
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:12,415
From the

929
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:14,207
Chicago riots

930
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:20,863
All sorts of things that you said are right around the corner

931
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:24,703
Yeah

932
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:25,471
Iceman

933
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:27,007
All my working time

934
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:31,359
Studying Alex Jones listening to his dump

935
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:33,663
Nightmares about you

936
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:42,367
William his

937
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:50,559
Have dreams about like Waterpark clearly you're the only person spending

938
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:54,399
Much time analytically listening to have

939
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:57,727
Goodbye

940
01:00:57,983 --> 01:01:00,543
So it is next clip there's a really long pause

941
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:01,567
Please

942
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:04,127
Be patient with Alex

943
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:07,199
The gears are turning

944
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:11,039
Sure he's trying to actually I'll explain

945
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:13,599
Really really funny

946
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:17,695
Baby Alive

947
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:18,463
Born

948
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:20,767
The bill did not

949
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:39,711
Why would they want to do that

950
01:01:42,271 --> 01:01:45,855
Causes really funny if you go and watch the video

951
01:01:46,111 --> 01:01:50,975
Suppose organ harvesting Bell on the context of him being on Rogan's podcast

952
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:55,583
Leave Alex until he looked into it

953
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:56,863
How to find out Alex's right

954
01:01:57,375 --> 01:01:58,655
When that pain starts

955
01:01:58,911 --> 01:02:03,263
Screw flashes up on screen and article from Newsweek with the headline

956
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:09,663
Alex Jones Joe Rogan conspiracy theory meltdown

957
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:15,551
This is sunscreen for like a second or two and then the camera Cuts back to Alex in silence

958
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:17,087
With a look on his face like

959
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:19,647
Come on guys

960
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:26,303
Deflation is just like his really that's the

961
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:30,143
Exasperation

962
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:31,679
Liquor just a moment of like

963
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:35,519
Where's about us cuz we're so good

964
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:36,543
Next clip

965
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:38,591
Come on guys

966
01:02:46,527 --> 01:02:47,807
Liability for doctors

967
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:52,159
This is a cynical political move as even CBS News pointed out

968
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:59,327
The measures have been defeated multiple times in recent years but Senate Republicans vote

969
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:02,655
Will GOP lawmakers to make an election-year appeal

970
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:03,935
Conservative voter

971
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:10,591
I was just making sure it up about this because he's an idiot liar and a zealot pause was pretty f****** funny

972
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:15,199
I'll post a picture of it somewhere cuz I take a screenshot

973
01:03:16,735 --> 01:03:18,271
Text me too much

974
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:20,831
So Alex's

975
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:22,111
Northstar

976
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:23,391
HomeBase

977
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:24,671
Racism

978
01:03:25,183 --> 01:03:26,207
I was going to say Bible

979
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:27,231
Oh okay

980
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:31,071
Year in this next

981
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:33,375
Chucky doll

982
01:03:36,959 --> 01:03:37,727
Kill your ass

983
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:40,287
Canterbury Hall

984
01:03:45,919 --> 01:03:46,431
Like to be the one

985
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:48,479
When you attack

986
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:56,159
The Galaxy knows what suffering means in this context

987
01:03:56,927 --> 01:04:02,559
Jesus said suffer the little children and forbid them not to come unto me

988
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:04,863
For of such is the kingdom of heaven

989
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:09,471
It's a term that's also used in Mark 10 14 and Luke 1816

990
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:12,031
The context is the same

991
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:15,359
In the language of the time suffer meant to allow something to be done

992
01:04:15,615 --> 01:04:19,711
Jesus says suffer the children to come unto me

993
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:26,623
Jesus did not say going to kill your ass

994
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:33,023
Blasphemous

995
01:04:33,535 --> 01:04:36,095
And delay but maybe they just cut that out of the Bible

996
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:41,983
The thing about disconnected from any of that stuff and it comes from

997
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:43,519
17 + 2

998
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:50,175
The disciples it's impossible but the offences will come

999
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:51,455
They come

1000
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:55,295
It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck

1001
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:59,647
Cast into the sea of these little ones

1002
01:05:00,671 --> 01:05:06,815
Context is passages that Jesus is talking to his disciples and explain to them that it's impossible to live a life free from trouble

1003
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:10,143
But woe to the person who brings about those troubles

1004
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:14,751
The little ones of this passage doesn't refer to children but to new believers who early in

1005
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:19,871
The pap and woe unto the person who would bring offense upon them that would lead them into sin

1006
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:21,919
The next versus Ark

1007
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:23,199
Take heed to yourselves

1008
01:05:23,455 --> 01:05:25,759
If your brother trespass against you rebuke

1009
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:27,551
And if he repents forgive him

1010
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:32,159
And if you trespass against you seven times in a day and 7 times in a day

1011
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:33,183
Turn it again

1012
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:34,719
How do you say

1013
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:35,999
You shall forgive him

1014
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:39,839
This is really more about appropriate behavior among believers

1015
01:05:40,863 --> 01:05:43,679
Is your fellow believer wrongs you or tries to lead you into sin

1016
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:47,519
Call them out for it if they're receptive to that

1017
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:49,055
Your responsibility to forgive

1018
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:50,335
If they don't reply

1019
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:52,127
Then woe unto them

1020
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:55,199
And they're better off jumping into the sea with a millstone around their neck

1021
01:05:55,711 --> 01:05:58,783
This has nothing to do with suffering children spicy little ones part

1022
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:03,903
In there

1023
01:06:04,415 --> 01:06:08,511
He has such a bad grasp. Like really basic elements

1024
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:10,047
Understanding

1025
01:06:10,303 --> 01:06:11,583
Main text of the

1026
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:17,471
Professor doesn't know how to read listen to anybody when they tell him that he's wrong

1027
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:20,799
So we're seeing a little bit of an upper

1028
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:22,079
Swing

1029
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:23,615
And covid-19

1030
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:26,175
18 cases

1031
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:26,943
Shock

1032
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:29,759
Alex makes fun of that innocence.

1033
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:34,623
Oh gosh trucks

1034
01:06:53,311 --> 01:06:53,823
You do it

1035
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:57,151
Boys and girls

1036
01:06:57,663 --> 01:07:03,807
Alex is he reporting that's coming out there spikes being seen in various states around the country which is pretty f***** up

1037
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:07,135
Inevitably the story

1038
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:10,975
The protests broke out after the murder of George the responsible for the updates

1039
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:12,255
Optix we're going to see here

1040
01:07:12,511 --> 01:07:14,047
And it's probably very unfair

1041
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:19,935
If we're already seeing increases that's way too fast for it to bend from these protests

1042
01:07:20,191 --> 01:07:21,727
Expectancy increases after these

1043
01:07:21,983 --> 01:07:22,751
Decided to open up

1044
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:26,591
Without proper at the real guidelines a testing in place

1045
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:27,359
Thibodaux

1046
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:29,663
You know it's almost like yeah

1047
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:34,783
MPR made a really good point that is right now

1048
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:38,111
Fair to call it a second wave we're still in the first wave

1049
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:39,391
It's just never ended

1050
01:07:39,903 --> 01:07:42,463
What are the countries just decided that's not real

1051
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:48,607
They're still over 20,000 reported in the US daily according to 11

1052
01:07:48,863 --> 01:07:50,655
Working on a 7-Day rolling average

1053
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:56,543
That's a ridiculously high number like adding as many cases as there are total in Ireland

1054
01:07:57,311 --> 01:08:00,895
We just become burnt out to this reality we started to get out

1055
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:07,295
In order to do the sort of things states are deciding to do safely testing and observation

1056
01:08:07,551 --> 01:08:12,159
Reason placed in order to make sure the case of the infected Bunch for people

1057
01:08:12,415 --> 01:08:14,207
That's just not wear a lot of states are

1058
01:08:14,975 --> 01:08:17,535
Their number states that are looking mighty scary right now

1059
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:21,887
I'm looking in the direction of Nevada Arkansas the Carolinas in Arizona

1060
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:24,447
All states that do not have stay-at-home guidance

1061
01:08:24,703 --> 01:08:25,215
Someplace

1062
01:08:25,983 --> 01:08:32,127
There's a one-to-one correlation between states that have stay-at-home orders going up or down

1063
01:08:32,383 --> 01:08:34,687
Possible to drop

1064
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:38,783
What the states that are all looking like there's trouble Brewing or ones where there aren't

1065
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:40,575
Rock Island

1066
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:45,695
We'll see what happens in the future but this is the point where I feel things are the most of all

1067
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:52,351
You have a market obsessed lunatic his presidency can re-election in November you have an entire right-wing media

1068
01:08:52,607 --> 01:08:57,727
Ecosystem pushing messaging that no matter what the deal is with the virus we have to protect the economy at all cost

1069
01:08:58,239 --> 01:09:00,543
Outrageously dangerous

1070
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:03,615
Messaging to Doctors Hospital

1071
01:09:03,871 --> 01:09:05,663
To create the false image of pandemic

1072
01:09:05,919 --> 01:09:06,431
That's just

1073
01:09:06,687 --> 01:09:08,223
F****** toxic combination

1074
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:11,551
And it really it really does think about

1075
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:13,343
Possibilities like if we see

1076
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:15,647
Massive upticks in a lot of states

1077
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:18,975
We could get you a position where people have to lockdown again

1078
01:09:19,231 --> 01:09:25,375
Like in the same way as or even harder than we did before Alex and so many of these people

1079
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:27,167
Responded

1080
01:09:27,423 --> 01:09:29,471
I just don't know

1081
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:35,359
Better than you

1082
01:09:35,615 --> 01:09:36,127
Your fears would be

1083
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:39,967
The possibilities of what could come just

1084
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:40,735
Terrifies me

1085
01:09:40,991 --> 01:09:42,015
I just hear

1086
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:43,295
Barbara tuchman

1087
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:45,343
Writing the march of folly to

1088
01:09:45,855 --> 01:09:46,623
Trump's War

1089
01:09:46,879 --> 01:09:51,231
That's that's just all I can think of right now this isn't the most

1090
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:52,767
Terrifying position

1091
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:54,815
With absolutely no leadership

1092
01:09:55,839 --> 01:09:56,351
Anyone

1093
01:09:56,863 --> 01:09:59,935
That's beyond political party

1094
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:00,959
Anyone

1095
01:10:01,471 --> 01:10:07,615
None of those people are dictator

1096
01:10:14,271 --> 01:10:17,343
With that

1097
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:18,879
He's better than Lightfoot

1098
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:22,975
Talking more about his soda

1099
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:27,071
Denialism and also that dumb video

1100
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:30,399
Mistakes that we know of

1101
01:10:31,423 --> 01:10:32,191
Premeditated

1102
01:10:35,263 --> 01:10:36,031
Pneumonia

1103
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:40,127
In

1104
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:42,687
Hospitals to murder

1105
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:44,479
Sure

1106
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:53,951
Seven-years-old

1107
01:10:58,303 --> 01:10:58,815
Bro

1108
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:00,863
Mazda Flame

1109
01:11:12,639 --> 01:11:13,663
So it's pretty bad

1110
01:11:18,783 --> 01:11:19,551
Can go back to back

1111
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:22,879
I come see you

1112
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:25,183
Tortured to death

1113
01:11:38,751 --> 01:11:39,263
52

1114
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:42,079
Thousand watches Casio

1115
01:11:43,615 --> 01:11:44,127
What

1116
01:11:45,151 --> 01:11:45,919
Who says that

1117
01:11:46,943 --> 01:11:47,967
Thousand lashes

1118
01:11:58,463 --> 01:11:58,975
Thanks

1119
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:03,583
Okay

1120
01:12:03,839 --> 01:12:07,679
Video that Erin put outside

1121
01:12:07,935 --> 01:12:09,983
If you're a doctor at Elmhurst Hospital

1122
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:12,031
Please do Alex Jones for defamation

1123
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:17,407
He's directly reporting to you and your staff took a patient with anxiety and killed them in order to make a few bucks

1124
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:21,247
This is a clear open-and-shut case I think I don't know

1125
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:26,367
The only evidence he has is this video

1126
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:28,671
This kind of thing cannot be allowed to stay

1127
01:12:29,183 --> 01:12:33,535
People's lives in danger on multiple fronts with this kind of rhetoric

1128
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:39,935
What is very basic in concrete level in the medical profession as a whole

1129
01:12:40,191 --> 01:12:43,007
Time when there's increased hostility and frequency

1130
01:12:43,263 --> 01:12:44,799
Hospital

1131
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:51,199
Alex clearly hope someone attacks the hospital at which point he can claim it was a false flag to make the nihilists look

1132
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:55,551
The dangerous path that is content is on is very high

1133
01:12:55,807 --> 01:12:56,575
It's it's

1134
01:12:57,087 --> 01:12:58,879
Very scary to imagine what could

1135
01:13:01,951 --> 01:13:03,743
At the very least you'll be able to get that

1136
01:13:03,999 --> 01:13:09,375
Full video deposition

1137
01:13:15,519 --> 01:13:16,543
Call please

1138
01:13:16,799 --> 01:13:20,383
I want a sequel position

1139
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:24,735
Supernaut

1140
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:25,759
From covid-19

1141
01:13:26,271 --> 01:13:29,599
If they believe Alex

1142
01:13:29,855 --> 01:13:30,879
Quick quick

1143
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:32,927
I'm being pulled off by these Hospital

1144
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:41,119
If they do get sick they'll be less inclined to seek appropriate care

1145
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:44,703
Go to the hospital

1146
01:13:45,727 --> 01:13:48,799
There's no worst combination of putting forth

1147
01:13:49,055 --> 01:13:50,591
This time

1148
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:51,359
People safe

1149
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:55,967
General neutral as possible

1150
01:13:56,223 --> 01:14:01,599
Where things get more out of control than they already in Elmhurst Hospital soon

1151
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:03,391
The list of people who need constant

1152
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:05,439
Staggering

1153
01:14:05,695 --> 01:14:07,231
Stagger

1154
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:12,095
I think that you run into a situation where I'm saying like Alex needs consequences for this and like

1155
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:16,959
You can easily get it twisted and meet you know think that I'm saying so much it is obviously I'm not

1156
01:14:17,215 --> 01:14:23,359
Give me the financial consequences he needs absolutely needs to have some sort of a negative

1157
01:14:23,615 --> 01:14:28,991
Push back to recognize these things are not okay

1158
01:14:30,527 --> 01:14:34,111
And I just don't obviously we can't do it ourselves but

1159
01:14:34,367 --> 01:14:37,439
Might have done it if we could

1160
01:14:37,695 --> 01:14:38,975
God I hope he Slanders

1161
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:40,767
Come on man

1162
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:42,047
I know you're listening

1163
01:14:42,303 --> 01:14:43,071
Say something

1164
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:44,863
I don't know I don't know

1165
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:47,423
Republic Republic figures

1166
01:14:48,191 --> 01:14:49,727
Put out of shower

1167
01:14:49,983 --> 01:14:52,287
I don't know public enough

1168
01:14:52,543 --> 01:14:55,871
So Alex last clip that like

1169
01:14:56,895 --> 01:15:03,039
GOP

1170
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:04,063
They're so smart

1171
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:07,391
Not psychotic at all cuz they're cool

1172
01:15:07,647 --> 01:15:11,487
Address that really quick it's another instance of his narrative

1173
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:15,583
Cuz he's talking about them killing you for money in the hospital

1174
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:21,727
The stuff about the red and blue states that supposed to be about

1175
01:15:22,495 --> 01:15:25,567
That's nonsense but it is nothing to do with the idea of hospitals killing people

1176
01:15:26,591 --> 01:15:27,871
Completely separate conspiracy

1177
01:15:28,127 --> 01:15:30,175
Has nothing to do with red and blue States

1178
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:32,479
When do you use bundled

1179
01:15:32,735 --> 01:15:34,271
That's like what Alex's describing

1180
01:15:34,527 --> 01:15:40,415
Mount hospitals are paper treating patients by Medicare is uniform a national it doesn't matter if it's a red or blue state

1181
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:42,207
Eye doctors in any state

1182
01:15:42,463 --> 01:15:44,255
Make the same treating patients

1183
01:15:44,511 --> 01:15:45,279
The same condition

1184
01:15:46,047 --> 01:15:52,191
The centers for Medicare and Medicaid Medicaid services figure out what the average cost of the treating a particular type of patient

1185
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:57,311
Standardized range that covers that they covered it that about

1186
01:15:57,823 --> 01:15:59,615
This is a great for a number of reasons

1187
01:16:00,383 --> 01:16:02,687
The first is that a drastically cuts down on the process

1188
01:16:02,943 --> 01:16:03,967
That's because before

1189
01:16:04,223 --> 01:16:07,807
Hospitals would have to build insurance or various tests

1190
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:09,599
On more paperwork

1191
01:16:10,111 --> 01:16:15,743
As you can imagine this also left a lot of windows open for people to run unnecessary tests to build the government for

1192
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:19,583
That's not something you can really get away with

1193
01:16:20,095 --> 01:16:25,471
Because you're also I just given this one payment amount for a condition incentivized

1194
01:16:25,727 --> 01:16:31,871
To provide the best possible care so you don't end up in a situation where your treatment is costing a ton more than Medicare

1195
01:16:32,127 --> 01:16:32,895
Medicaid cover

1196
01:16:33,663 --> 01:16:39,551
Exploring for Medicare and Medicaid services vendors to cut costs and provide improved

1197
01:16:39,807 --> 01:16:42,367
Because it cut out a lot of the uncertainty in wiggle room

1198
01:16:43,135 --> 01:16:46,719
Also in terms of covid-19

1199
01:16:46,975 --> 01:16:49,535
That's because there are four ton of medical condition

1200
01:16:50,047 --> 01:16:55,423
The amount that they determined it should cost to treat an average covid-19 patient is $13,000

1201
01:16:55,679 --> 01:17:01,823
A tournament that it would be if someone then ends up on a ventilator is $39,000 we've talked about this wedding

1202
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:04,895
Is 52,000 number is just him

1203
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:06,175
Those together

1204
01:17:06,687 --> 01:17:11,551
Because he thinks that you get 13 for diagnosing them is covid-19 thousand bonus

1205
01:17:11,807 --> 01:17:13,855
Just making up

1206
01:17:14,367 --> 01:17:20,511
Hospitals are paid each day when they have the patience in there there

1207
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:22,559
Treetop or whatever

1208
01:17:23,327 --> 01:17:26,655
I want to take advantage of his audience not knowing how these bundled payments work

1209
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:27,423
Which is shity

1210
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:29,215
But it's also very transparent

1211
01:17:29,471 --> 01:17:31,519
You take some time to look into the topic he's cover

1212
01:17:32,031 --> 01:17:33,055
Just think for one second

1213
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:37,919
Is there a Stanford Hospital gets for pneumonia which there is

1214
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:40,991
Then we'll be stopping hospital last year

1215
01:17:41,247 --> 01:17:44,063
I'm calling every cost pneumonia more money

1216
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:50,463
What's that mean you understand this is when you strike

1217
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:55,327
It's back then everybody nothing

1218
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:58,399
Alex thinks he's reporting on proof of the vast conspiracy but

1219
01:17:58,655 --> 01:18:01,983
Really just reporting on how he doesn't know how Medicare bundles pay my

1220
01:18:03,263 --> 01:18:08,639
So that's cool well you know when you say he's taking advantage of his audience not knowing how anything works

1221
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:11,199
That is also a blanket state

1222
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:19,647
Please take that is applied on all future episodes

1223
01:18:20,671 --> 01:18:21,183
So what

1224
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:23,231
To talking about how like you know

1225
01:18:23,743 --> 01:18:24,511
GOP

1226
01:18:25,023 --> 01:18:27,071
They're naive but not evil

1227
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:28,351
God

1228
01:18:28,863 --> 01:18:32,191
The expanse

1229
01:18:32,447 --> 01:18:33,215
Why didn't

1230
01:18:46,783 --> 01:18:47,807
Real naive

1231
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:49,343
But now they're not coming up

1232
01:18:50,623 --> 01:18:51,903
Because Lex Luthor

1233
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:57,279
You're operating off of normal human communication

1234
01:18:57,791 --> 01:19:01,887
The scheme but Alex is referring to is the last scheme

1235
01:19:04,447 --> 01:19:07,775
He was getting money for covid patients

1236
01:19:08,287 --> 01:19:08,799
Talking about

1237
01:19:09,311 --> 01:19:11,359
So the decision about bundled payments

1238
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:12,383
Covid-19

1239
01:19:12,639 --> 01:19:15,199
Possible by HR 748

1240
01:19:15,455 --> 01:19:18,271
Or the coronavirus Aid relief and Economic Security Act

1241
01:19:18,783 --> 01:19:20,575
This bill was signed into law

1242
01:19:20,831 --> 01:19:22,623
And was widely supported in Congress

1243
01:19:23,135 --> 01:19:28,767
I passed the house 419 to 6 and went through the Senate 90620 with for non-voters

1244
01:19:29,535 --> 01:19:34,143
Ramp parking lot

1245
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:39,007
You can bet on that Mike Lee from Utah

1246
01:19:39,263 --> 01:19:40,031
From South Dakota

1247
01:19:40,543 --> 01:19:46,687
Ram Paulding vote because he was in isolation with the time cuz he tested positive for covid-19 and both Mike Leanne

1248
01:19:46,943 --> 01:19:50,015
Mitt Romney had to go into quarantine because it had contact with Ron

1249
01:19:51,551 --> 01:19:52,319
No idea was up

1250
01:19:52,575 --> 01:19:54,879
Call dumbass was responsible for

1251
01:19:55,135 --> 01:19:57,951
Coronavirus relief

1252
01:19:58,207 --> 01:20:01,023
That could have been

1253
01:20:01,535 --> 01:20:03,071
And honestly

1254
01:20:03,327 --> 01:20:04,351
I would say

1255
01:20:04,607 --> 01:20:09,471
I don't think I'm joking about this

1256
01:20:09,983 --> 01:20:12,031
Oh damn

1257
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:20,224
Did the schemes have standardized bundled payments was part of the bipartisan bill that Trump signed into law

1258
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:23,040
Something of a red state-blue state

1259
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:28,416
Work cut out for us

1260
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:33,792
Sign that panzano

1261
01:20:34,048 --> 01:20:36,352
And he was drinking poison Diet Coke

1262
01:20:36,608 --> 01:20:42,240
I think I got a lot on the ground

1263
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:43,008
Yeah

1264
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:46,592
You know when someone lies

1265
01:20:46,848 --> 01:20:52,736
I'm kind of lie about him and then they can't call you out about it

1266
01:20:52,992 --> 01:20:55,808
Environment where all sorts of lies are fine

1267
01:20:56,064 --> 01:20:58,112
Alex gets into that game about this nurse

1268
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:01,952
Murder

1269
01:21:03,744 --> 01:21:04,256
Banal another

1270
01:21:23,968 --> 01:21:29,856
She was a nurse in the Army in a rock but Alex is absolutely making up that she has a Purple Heart

1271
01:21:30,368 --> 01:21:36,512
That's a specific metal or killed in service

1272
01:21:36,768 --> 01:21:38,304
Stolen Valor by proxy

1273
01:21:39,072 --> 01:21:41,888
Alex has absolutely zero respect for the armed services

1274
01:21:42,144 --> 01:21:47,008
You just makes up stuff like this when he needs it to make a weirdo anti-vax nurse sound more credible

1275
01:21:47,264 --> 01:21:51,104
And killed in the line of duty

1276
01:21:51,616 --> 01:21:54,688
And I was just give a s***

1277
01:21:54,944 --> 01:21:55,456
No

1278
01:21:55,968 --> 01:21:57,760
Alex gets a little bit

1279
01:21:58,016 --> 01:21:58,528
Fed Up

1280
01:21:59,296 --> 01:21:59,808
About

1281
01:22:00,576 --> 01:22:01,600
Black lives matter

1282
01:22:01,856 --> 01:22:03,648
And stuff

1283
01:22:03,904 --> 01:22:10,048
You gets pretty mad any another cost button Shores you

1284
01:22:16,704 --> 01:22:17,216
Calling you

1285
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:26,944
Ugly black baby

1286
01:22:40,512 --> 01:22:41,280
Screw you too

1287
01:22:49,472 --> 01:22:50,752
Virtue signaling

1288
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:51,520
Person

1289
01:22:51,776 --> 01:22:52,288
Up here

1290
01:23:25,824 --> 01:23:30,944
Little sloppy

1291
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:37,344
It was very practical to tell you something professional

1292
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:39,136
So here is that unedited

1293
01:23:43,488 --> 01:23:44,512
Starbucks

1294
01:23:48,864 --> 01:23:49,632
The New World Order

1295
01:23:49,888 --> 01:23:50,912
I will get your ass

1296
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:56,544
Ono Ono Ono

1297
01:23:57,568 --> 01:23:58,336
Oh no

1298
01:23:58,592 --> 01:23:59,360
Oh no

1299
01:23:59,872 --> 01:24:04,224
Is that 1997 got home

1300
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:10,624
Physical now god dammit my life alright alright alright

1301
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:17,024
Daughter

1302
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:19,328
Never get it back whenever you're better

1303
01:24:19,584 --> 01:24:21,376
Ciders

1304
01:24:21,632 --> 01:24:24,448
Also I should say in that last

1305
01:24:24,704 --> 01:24:26,496
Episode

1306
01:24:26,752 --> 01:24:32,896
My little mini 7 minutes

1307
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:44,672
Couple things I have in my iTunes

1308
01:24:45,696 --> 01:24:51,840
Clarify that cuz I heard it from enough people but ya don't disrespect

1309
01:24:52,096 --> 01:24:53,888
I got it disrespectful

1310
01:24:54,144 --> 01:25:00,288
Hollywood well I mean consider you took down

1311
01:25:00,544 --> 01:25:02,848
Disrespect

1312
01:25:03,104 --> 01:25:04,640
I am maybe all of them who cares

1313
01:25:04,896 --> 01:25:06,688
Have fun with that Scott Hall had a toothpick

1314
01:25:08,736 --> 01:25:11,040
Don't know

1315
01:25:11,552 --> 01:25:12,832
So Alex.

1316
01:25:13,088 --> 01:25:16,416
Discussing how his enemies are psychic vampires

1317
01:25:16,672 --> 01:25:17,696
Tamales

1318
01:25:17,952 --> 01:25:19,744
Along with it

1319
01:25:38,432 --> 01:25:38,944
Stray kids

1320
01:25:56,864 --> 01:25:57,632
Weave

1321
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:09,664
That is such fake

1322
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:11,712
Fashion in Socastee

1323
01:26:11,968 --> 01:26:14,016
I feel like we've heard that rats so many times

1324
01:26:14,272 --> 01:26:20,416
When I was listening to myself getting really bored

1325
01:26:20,672 --> 01:26:26,816
He was getting more excited

1326
01:26:31,168 --> 01:26:33,984
Pronouncement cuz it's definitely

1327
01:26:34,496 --> 01:26:40,640
How to declare war on Bill Gates about a thousand times already

1328
01:26:40,896 --> 01:26:43,712
Yelling a bunch of s***

1329
01:26:43,968 --> 01:26:47,040
I was thinking about the Declaration

1330
01:26:47,296 --> 01:26:53,440
The meaningless but I think it's a tacit acknowledgment to keep anyone

1331
01:26:53,952 --> 01:26:54,464
Attention these days

1332
01:26:55,232 --> 01:26:58,048
You have to act like this is a major step for him when in reality

1333
01:26:58,560 --> 01:26:59,840
Sissy

1334
01:27:00,352 --> 01:27:01,120
It's just

1335
01:27:01,632 --> 01:27:06,496
Atomic robot going through their set

1336
01:27:06,752 --> 01:27:11,360
It screams false passion I think it's really sad to see this rote repetition of

1337
01:27:11,616 --> 01:27:13,408
I declare war on Bill Gates

1338
01:27:15,968 --> 01:27:18,528
Did you see the

1339
01:27:18,784 --> 01:27:24,928
Clip going around two of the Marchers in the UK

1340
01:27:25,184 --> 01:27:25,952
East End eye

1341
01:27:26,208 --> 01:27:32,352
That's the way we like it I think I saw a link but I don't know I don't know if it's true I don't know if it's real

1342
01:27:32,608 --> 01:27:36,192
I was just listen to that ranch and I was thinking about that song Angie

1343
01:27:37,472 --> 01:27:38,752
It was almost a relief

1344
01:27:39,008 --> 01:27:40,032
To hear it like that

1345
01:27:40,288 --> 01:27:46,432
You know like thank you I don't have to do any thinking I don't have to do this Friday

1346
01:27:46,688 --> 01:27:52,832
Yes you're just saying what I already know

1347
01:27:53,088 --> 01:27:54,112
Thank you

1348
01:27:54,368 --> 01:27:58,720
As interesting as it is just as bad as

1349
01:28:00,768 --> 01:28:06,400
Because of what we do

1350
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:07,168
Profession

1351
01:28:07,424 --> 01:28:08,192
Basically

1352
01:28:11,008 --> 01:28:16,384
Galaxy junior varsity plot which is the African warlord in Seattle

1353
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:18,432
The top

1354
01:28:18,688 --> 01:28:19,968
Story is

1355
01:28:20,224 --> 01:28:25,344
Nurse video about the

1356
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:28,416
This is the B story in an episode of Cheers

1357
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:35,584
He's back to talking about this a little bit

1358
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:42,496
Course the white

1359
01:28:42,752 --> 01:28:43,264
Communist

1360
01:28:45,824 --> 01:28:46,336
Front guy

1361
01:28:46,592 --> 01:28:47,104
Sure

1362
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:51,712
What

1363
01:28:55,296 --> 01:29:01,440
So just up top leader of the autonomous Zone

1364
01:29:01,696 --> 01:29:02,208
The right-wing media

1365
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:08,864
Examine the idea that Alex is putting forth some kind of

1366
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:10,144
Virtue signaling

1367
01:29:11,168 --> 01:29:13,216
To be doing that over antifa okay

1368
01:29:13,472 --> 01:29:15,008
Alright Alex's assuming

1369
01:29:15,264 --> 01:29:21,152
Black person in a leadership role is virtue signaling

1370
01:29:21,408 --> 01:29:23,712
Most of the people at the autonomous zone are white

1371
01:29:24,224 --> 01:29:28,576
Pretending

1372
01:29:28,832 --> 01:29:30,624
Pencil erases for you for Alex to have

1373
01:29:31,136 --> 01:29:36,256
What is Simona legitimately happen to be the person with the best communication skills and Leadership abilities

1374
01:29:36,768 --> 01:29:40,096
What if he was the person most able to articulate the values of a community

1375
01:29:40,352 --> 01:29:43,424
The person of the community felt was best able to negotiate with the city

1376
01:29:44,192 --> 01:29:47,008
Because I was a gigantic

1377
01:29:47,264 --> 01:29:49,824
Possible context in decision-making

1378
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:52,896
Through the prism of his white fear

1379
01:29:53,664 --> 01:29:54,432
There's a black guy

1380
01:29:54,688 --> 01:29:55,712
That leadership position

1381
01:29:55,968 --> 01:30:02,112
Must be a self-hating Jew signal

1382
01:30:03,136 --> 01:30:06,720
You can see how this thing can be broadly applied to essentially denigrate

1383
01:30:06,976 --> 01:30:09,280
Pretty much all non-white achievement in society

1384
01:30:09,792 --> 01:30:15,936
How is what Alex is saying any different than a racist you might know who says that a black woman who got a promotion at his office

1385
01:30:16,192 --> 01:30:19,008
Which is the business virtue signaling as opposed to her work

1386
01:30:19,264 --> 01:30:20,032
Hardin

1387
01:30:20,544 --> 01:30:26,688
How is what Alex is different than a bigot on a college campus seeing and non-white students and assuming that they got into school

1388
01:30:26,944 --> 01:30:28,480
Gustav diversity quotas

1389
01:30:28,736 --> 01:30:31,296
As opposed to them having great test scores in a GPA

1390
01:30:32,064 --> 01:30:33,856
Details about Ransom own

1391
01:30:34,112 --> 01:30:35,392
Just made up here and what is

1392
01:30:35,648 --> 01:30:36,160
Very real

1393
01:30:36,672 --> 01:30:38,464
Is Alex's reaction to imagine

1394
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:39,488
Has to be a black person

1395
01:30:39,744 --> 01:30:40,256
Interposition

1396
01:30:40,512 --> 01:30:41,536
Authority over white people

1397
01:30:41,792 --> 01:30:42,304
He can't stand

1398
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:48,704
Yeah especially for somebody whose guests are 99% white and calls hotep Jesus the

1399
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:50,496
Black person to speak for him

1400
01:30:50,752 --> 01:30:51,264
Sure

1401
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:57,664
That is 99% still

1402
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:59,712
Thurgood Marshall

1403
01:30:59,968 --> 01:31:05,088
Let's get Clarence Thomas I should tell you that

1404
01:31:05,344 --> 01:31:08,928
American Gaston this show

1405
01:31:09,184 --> 01:31:10,976
Time black panther

1406
01:31:11,488 --> 01:31:17,632
People didn't

1407
01:31:18,144 --> 01:31:24,288
In the black lives matter stuff today's with looting and rioting she wear

1408
01:31:24,544 --> 01:31:27,360
The new generation is doing and I just have no time for that

1409
01:31:27,872 --> 01:31:32,992
It's pretty funny though because Larry Pinkney was arrested back in the mid-70s

1410
01:31:33,248 --> 01:31:35,040
You peel to the United Nations which is

1411
01:31:35,552 --> 01:31:36,576
That's interesting

1412
01:31:37,088 --> 01:31:43,232
If United States of the sovereign state

1413
01:31:43,488 --> 01:31:49,120
Step in that clearly implies that the UN has some kind of authority that supersedes sovereignty

1414
01:31:49,632 --> 01:31:51,424
And Alex really f****** hate that

1415
01:31:52,192 --> 01:31:53,216
That subject

1416
01:31:53,472 --> 01:31:58,336
She probably realized the original black panthers were straight up revolutionary socialist

1417
01:31:58,592 --> 01:32:04,736
How to sing

1418
01:32:06,272 --> 01:32:12,416
Rescue the same thing no I am sure that whenever a flanks of black panthers were walking

1419
01:32:12,672 --> 01:32:16,512
Carrying assault rifles watching the cops arrest somebody Alex

1420
01:32:16,768 --> 01:32:22,912
Good those are the good black panthers I don't like these new trying to present

1421
01:32:23,168 --> 01:32:24,960
Interview

1422
01:32:25,216 --> 01:32:26,240
Very weird

1423
01:32:26,496 --> 01:32:28,288
Huey Newton and Bobby seale were

1424
01:32:28,544 --> 01:32:31,872
F****** Marxist

1425
01:32:32,128 --> 01:32:35,968
The f****** breakfast program is literally socialism

1426
01:32:36,224 --> 01:32:42,368
If you consult the Panthers ten point program that serves as a basis for the party

1427
01:32:42,624 --> 01:32:43,392
Relevant to today

1428
01:32:43,904 --> 01:32:47,232
Distance number for was a demand for decent housing

1429
01:32:47,488 --> 01:32:52,096
And quote is the landlord's

1430
01:32:52,352 --> 01:32:54,656
Housing and Blanche

1431
01:32:54,912 --> 01:32:57,216
It's so the people in our government

1432
01:32:57,472 --> 01:32:59,520
Can build and make decent housing for the people

1433
01:33:00,288 --> 01:33:02,592
There's a lot of people conversation now

1434
01:33:03,104 --> 01:33:07,712
Number six was quote we completely free healthcare for all black and oppressed people

1435
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:09,504
Number three was quote

1436
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:13,600
We want an end to the robbery by the capitalists of our black community

1437
01:33:14,112 --> 01:33:20,000
Legitimately to around in the 60s he would have been doing everything in his power to get a white guy to kill Larry Pinkney

1438
01:33:27,168 --> 01:33:28,192
It's it is

1439
01:33:28,448 --> 01:33:31,008
It was actually hard to listen

1440
01:33:31,264 --> 01:33:32,032
Handle it

1441
01:33:32,288 --> 01:33:35,872
Oh man last clip here in Salix hitting a news story

1442
01:33:36,128 --> 01:33:38,176
I can go maybe it's his

1443
01:33:38,432 --> 01:33:40,224
Junior varsity two-story

1444
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:42,272
I don't know this these stories

1445
01:33:42,528 --> 01:33:43,040
Wild

1446
01:33:48,928 --> 01:33:49,440
BLM protests

1447
01:33:49,696 --> 01:33:50,208
Virginia

1448
01:33:52,512 --> 01:33:54,560
It's an unfortunate truth that a man was

1449
01:33:54,816 --> 01:33:57,888
Hit by Falling statue of the protest in Portsmouth Virginia

1450
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:01,472
He's currently in stable condition and hopefully he'll make a speedy recovery

1451
01:34:01,984 --> 01:34:04,800
When reached for comment by local news Rocky Huynh

1452
01:34:05,056 --> 01:34:07,104
Organizers of the protest

1453
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:10,688
We are responsible for this whatever way we can

1454
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:15,296
I apologized on our behalf and his sister said he doesn't want anyone upset with us

1455
01:34:15,552 --> 01:34:17,600
His family was not upset their hurting

1456
01:34:18,112 --> 01:34:23,744
The protest organizer set up a GoFundMe and they've raised over $40,000 to support the family pay for medical bills

1457
01:34:24,256 --> 01:34:30,400
It's a tragic accident but thankfully the guy survived the protesters recognize their responsibility

1458
01:34:30,656 --> 01:34:33,472
Because of something that went wrong in one of their

1459
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:39,360
You'd obviously prefer it never would have happened at all I can never get in accidents like this happen

1460
01:34:39,616 --> 01:34:41,664
Seahawk communities

1461
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:44,480
Step up and take care of each other

1462
01:34:44,736 --> 01:34:46,016
This actually

1463
01:34:46,272 --> 01:34:47,040
Inspirational

1464
01:34:47,296 --> 01:34:49,600
Wrinkle to the store

1465
01:34:50,112 --> 01:34:50,880
Of course

1466
01:34:51,136 --> 01:34:57,280
Because right now we're experiencing such chaos that it would be shocking to me

1467
01:34:57,536 --> 01:34:58,048
Didn't happen

1468
01:34:58,304 --> 01:35:01,120
Course they're going to end

1469
01:35:01,632 --> 01:35:03,168
The fact that people are actually

1470
01:35:03,424 --> 01:35:04,960
Taking responsibility for it is something

1471
01:35:05,984 --> 01:35:06,496
Universal

1472
01:35:07,008 --> 01:35:11,616
Like all across the board and again we were forced into this chaotic position

1473
01:35:11,872 --> 01:35:13,920
It's not like we all got here on our own

1474
01:35:15,456 --> 01:35:19,552
Thursday June 11th episode

1475
01:35:19,808 --> 01:35:25,696
I would say that I have circle around like this is so Danger

1476
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:29,280
I know that Alex's disparage

1477
01:35:29,536 --> 01:35:33,120
Nurses and doctors as like they're just getting drunk and f****** in the hospital

1478
01:35:33,632 --> 01:35:39,264
I'm not disrespectful terrible

1479
01:35:40,032 --> 01:35:42,336
Now and it's so indiscriminate like 8

1480
01:35:42,592 --> 01:35:44,640
It could be at any Hospital

1481
01:35:45,152 --> 01:35:45,664
Just

1482
01:35:46,176 --> 01:35:48,736
This can't be acceptable like

1483
01:35:48,992 --> 01:35:50,528
Has the potential for

1484
01:35:51,296 --> 01:35:52,064
Something

1485
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:53,344
Really really dark

1486
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:54,112
Really bad

1487
01:35:55,136 --> 01:35:56,672
I think that's the most important thing

1488
01:35:57,184 --> 01:35:57,696
And then

1489
01:35:58,976 --> 01:36:03,328
A weird editing thing is going to bother me

1490
01:36:03,584 --> 01:36:04,608
Yeah

1491
01:36:05,376 --> 01:36:05,888
You know what

1492
01:36:08,192 --> 01:36:10,752
This will be the hook for my book

1493
01:36:11,008 --> 01:36:17,152
History of

1494
01:36:19,456 --> 01:36:20,992
Happened why did you cut that out

1495
01:36:28,416 --> 01:36:31,744
Very weird

1496
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:38,144
Anyway 5 Seconds to the truth

1497
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:40,192
Simon & Schuster hit up your boy

1498
01:36:45,824 --> 01:36:51,968
We're also on Twitter

1499
01:36:52,224 --> 01:36:58,368
And if you could please find a local charity

1500
01:36:58,624 --> 01:37:00,928
Of the sort to help out in any way

1501
01:37:01,184 --> 01:37:07,328
300ZX Clerk

1502
01:37:11,936 --> 01:37:12,448
Alex

1503
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:13,472
In color

1504
01:37:13,728 --> 01:37:14,752
