Beyond

00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:06,271
I just wanted to put that in there is a timestamp

166
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:10,623
Is it to be holding up today's newspaper

167
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:15,231
We can all be sure

168
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:28,287

00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,335

Ladies

172
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,663
And gentlemen

173
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:37,247
Throughout the broadcast on the state of the world

174
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,551
Call Lynn about whatever you want

175
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:40,831
But if you

176
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,367
Call Lynn

177
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:45,951
About the fact that the global to try to get her up World War 3 right now

178
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:52,863
The war

179
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:55,935
Global war multi-region war

180
00:12:56,447 --> 00:13:00,031
Flat as a political distraction to get people to Rally behind

181
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,359
This is just after Benghazi

182
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:09,247
Is this idea that the trigger Wars in order

183
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:11,551
To cover up for the financial collapse

184
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:14,111
Which is interesting because

185
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:18,463
That's a classic out

186
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:27,935
It seems like the distraction is far worse than the problem that they're trying to

187
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:31,263
To distract from

188
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,847
Galleria Plaza, Newark International

189
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,127
100%

190
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,407
Stop it it feels like

191
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,455
And at the end of the day you got to buy gold

192
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,223
It feels like

193
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,503
Envy

194
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,783
Conspiracy this makes sense

195
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:47,391
As opposed to their Dracula vampire demon

196
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,583
If you look back a little bit

197
00:13:56,095 --> 00:14:00,191
Lane

198
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:04,287
You can see the

199
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,079
Connective tissue between this

200
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:08,639
Complained

201
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,503
Federal Reserve

202
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,271
Alex's

203
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,807
Particular brand

204
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:20,159
Of criticism is life based in

205
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,183
Flights to be mad

206
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:23,743
And you can see how you could take

207
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,279
Real world

208
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:30,655
Morphe

209
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,423
Is not there

210
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:33,727
It's like

211
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:37,055
When you're watching a movie you see the conspiracy theorist with his

212
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:41,919
With his Pitbull

213
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:42,943
That's interesting

214
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,991
What if you out a little bit and then it.

215
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,527
You just got a big

216
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:52,927
Like picture of the devil circled with like this is the guy that

217
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,487
This conspiracy theorist anymore

218
00:14:55,743 --> 00:15:01,887
And if you have like a conspiracy board and it's only got a few pieces of yarn connecting

219
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:02,911
Utah

220
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,959
You're saying

221
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:11,359
Looking at

222
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:17,759
Devil's in the middle but I don't know I'm going to call it a sweaty

223
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:18,527
Are you know it's trouble

224
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,855
Fairy

225
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,415
Full of himself

226
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:31,327
Here with you today I'm so honored to be speaking to millions of my fellow human

227
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:34,143
United States Canada Mexico

228
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:38,239
Australia

229
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:40,799
Latin America all over the world

230
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:48,735
Marshall Islands people are listening to this worldwide transmission

231
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:52,575
It's interesting to hear that Alex thinks he has a listener is in Antarctica

232
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:57,183
There are no native populations in Antarctica unless you're talking about penguins

233
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,719
The only humans

234
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:00,511
Live in

235
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:01,535
Garden

236
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:02,815
They're working on so

237
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,095
Some of the research bases that have

238
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:04,863
Open setup

239
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,679
There are 66 bases in all of that.

240
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:14,335
In the summer months for thousand people in Antarctica

241
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:17,407
Where is Anna Wintour about 1,000

242
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:23,295
Is squarely in Antarctica

243
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,319
Attitude

244
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,087
Point

245
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:30,207
There are more tourists passing through Antarctica than there are people living there

246
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,791
Kick off until November

247
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:38,655
And most don't even actually even advise you plan a trip until like December or January

248
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:46,079
Info Warriors are really known for being

249
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:52,479
Smart

250
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:58,879
Is there winter scientist

251
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,927
But I don't believe in any of it alright

252
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:07,327
I don't believe in any of this stuff 100,000 years ago that obviously

253
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:10,143
We didn't happen or is it

254
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:10,911
Anyways

255
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,191
Is this is a low

256
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:12,959
Estranged

257
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:17,823
I highly doubt that any listeners in Antarctica

258
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,359
Seems like the invitation

259
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,127
Reserved

260
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:24,735
I'm at this point Alex has strong beliefs

261
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:26,015
Globalist

262
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:28,319
Can just like bresse a button

263
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,671
This happened all over the world

264
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:36,255
The phone button literally

265
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:38,559
I can punch a button

266
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:43,423
And other Jihadi squads that have been allowed to operate our countries

267
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,191
Will start

268
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:44,959
Bongs

269
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:49,567
All of our lives

270
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:52,895
America versus Iran

271
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:55,455
Versus Syria

272
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,991
No no no no no

273
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:59,295
Its Global Mega bankers

274
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:01,855
Financing Alside

275
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,135
For conflict

276
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:07,231
So they can destroy one free Society

277
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:09,279
Make sense

278
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:11,327
Conspiracy

279
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:17,215
The evil Strangelove

280
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,751
It makes sense

281
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:20,799
Classic

282
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:21,823
Call Swaggart

283
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:22,591
Like

284
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,151
It's not

285
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:28,479
Not an overly complicated thing that involves other dimensions

286
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:35,647
I still disagree on

287
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:36,671
Next to nothing

288
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:37,951
At least

289
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:40,255
The devil

290
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:42,303
Apply retroactively to

291
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,327
Alex Jones's career

292
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:47,935
Do we have we have to reconnect realize everything that we see in the past

293
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:48,703
Through what

294
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:49,471
Eventually

295
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:52,287
Because it must have to be like

296
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:58,687
You know Mister Echo

297
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:05,087
I mean

298
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:08,415
Come into play

299
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:12,511
Search Problem

300
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:17,119
Obviously all this is still supposed to be the devil

301
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:27,871
In terms of political Intrigue and Nations.

302
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:32,479
Ideas are stupid

303
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:35,039
Stop

304
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:40,159
It's great real life

305
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:47,071
It's humid hot demonic

306
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,631
You know those

307
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:52,703
Demons didn't come out one beneath the water to open the

308
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:55,775
Bombay daughter he'll say that the globalist hate humans

309
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:57,823
Populate

310
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:58,847
And stuff like Mars

311
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,127
But it's not like

312
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,199
Beelzebub

313
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:04,479
Cigar right

314
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:07,295
This terrorist button

315
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:08,831
Compress and then pick

316
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:10,111
The trouble

317
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,135
Empower

318
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:13,951
Sure

319
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:18,047
Child

320
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,327
Understand

321
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:22,399
I whenever Revenge of the Sith

322
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:23,935
Came out

323
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:26,239
Whatever it is

324
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:27,775
Not really into Star Wars

325
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:30,591
I guess it was about 78 years ago guys look up

326
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,175
Aaliyah

327
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:36,223
Cheesy Star Wars prequels

328
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,783
And of those films

329
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:45,439
God I hate you

330
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:51,327
Even throughout the past

331
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:56,959
So are you like Star Wars

332
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:57,983
You have a

333
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:00,287
You're on a little known planet

334
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:02,591
Finances

335
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:04,639
Is planet

336
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,407
Albert

337
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:08,223
Over trade deals 2005 so

338
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:08,991
7 years ago

339
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:13,087
And

340
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:14,367
Prominent in the Senate

341
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:17,952
Finances grapes terrorists to attack

342
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,232
The home

343
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:22,560
As a pre-check

344
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:27,936
The police

345
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:28,704
Stop

346
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,728
Terrorist attack

347
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:32,800
Abolishes

348
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:36,128
Basically using the

349
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,920
Touchdown

350
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,760
Punch down the old police force and wipes them out

351
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:46,112
When the movie came out the media all of the places

352
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:48,160
We don't understand the plot

353
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:50,208
We don't know what this mean

354
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,512
I don't think they did

355
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:54,816
Despotic

356
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:59,936
Do I don't remember people get confused

357
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:08,896
Drama

358
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:09,920
Sure

359
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:15,296
That was certainly

360
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:18,624
He was offended by that

361
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:26,304
There were troubles related to

362
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:30,912
About an evil man

363
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:34,240
We can understand I think

364
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:37,056
On the basis of like

365
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,080
Got Strokes

366
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:42,688
You know the bad guy

367
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,968
He's doing evil s***

368
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:49,856
It just brings up

369
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:52,160
These assholes

370
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:01,120
Comes in from commercial break

371
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:01,888
Who plays this

372
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:04,448
You are either with the Republic

373
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:11,104
Again about the turn of Darth Vader

374
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:11,872
Absolute

375
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,968
Obi-Wan tells him only a Sith fix it

376
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:17,760
Sure sure

377
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:25,696
Are you still even one of Alex's like real world

378
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:26,464
Is George Bush

379
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,304
Terrorist

380
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,608
Thinking and absolute ideas

381
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,960
Are traditionally prism of like that being

382
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:40,544
Approached

383
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,848
Alex still thinks

384
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:47,200
He doesn't

385
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,808
He kind of does.

386
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:53,856
So Alex believes

387
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:55,904
This whole thing in Star Wars

388
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:01,024
The allegory for 9/11

389
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,048
Who did interviews

390
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:03,584
Where you basically

391
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:05,120
Y'all basically I do

392
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,912
9/11 truther

393
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,704
George Lucas

394
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:12,288
What do you mean you can't get

395
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:16,384
Criminal elements of the government are staging terror attack

396
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:19,456
As a pretext to take over Society

397
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:21,504
Just like we're seeing today

398
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:24,320
Basically

399
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:27,904
That's what he said

400
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:28,672
He said

401
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:30,208
Just like we're seeing today

402
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:32,000
Is it at the Cannes Film Festival

403
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:33,280
Don't look it up it was all over the news

404
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:35,072
And the news

405
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,352
NSAID

406
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:38,912
We don't know what this means

407
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,984
What children do

408
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:45,056
George Lucas interview

409
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:45,824
Talking about

410
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:51,712
The US map

411
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:57,088
Macklemore it is

412
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,184
Fiat

413
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:06,048
Well

414
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:06,816
The story

415
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:14,240
Are you want to do a movie about

416
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,056
Figure out how

417
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:25,760
Hoping over to his

418
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:27,808
Anything about

419
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:29,856
Treated well

420
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:31,136
You don't do your job

421
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:35,744
Whatever

422
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,792
You're all thinking go awry

423
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,072
If you're always bicker

424
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:40,864
Agreeing

425
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:43,168
Like to do

426
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:46,240
Auburn do it for you

427
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:50,848
Go where the

428
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:54,688
What leadership is

429
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:58,528
He's like a warning about Trump

430
00:25:58,784 --> 00:25:59,552
What's wrong

431
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:09,024
You know George Lucas is going around cancel Tesla

432
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:14,144
I'm pretty sure that that level-headed response to a question was asked

433
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,704
Actually him secretly screaming on right side

434
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:22,336
Bush did 9/11

435
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:24,640
Maybe take the first letter of each of them

436
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:27,200
It spells out G W bush did 9/11

437
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:30,272
I'm pretty sure that's

438
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:32,064
He's very clever that George Lucas

439
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,160
Yeah so Alex has

440
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:36,928
Bi-Lo

441
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,464
Some feelings about

442
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:41,024
Some feelings about

443
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,328
Various protest that are happening

444
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,400
In the Middle Eastern countries like yeah man and Egypt

445
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:50,240
It's interesting because at this point

446
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:55,616
The actual attack

447
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:57,920
Like I develop narrative

448
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:59,456
There isn't a lot of

449
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:02,272
Clinton lied people died that kind of thing

450
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:05,344
At this point

451
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:06,880
Alex has

452
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:07,904
To go on really

453
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,928
Is discussing

454
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:12,512
To be the inciting

455
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:14,560
Which is that

456
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:18,144
Innocent

457
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:22,240
So Alex has some ideas about this

458
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,104
This movie or probably thinking a movie

459
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,896
Article on it

460
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:30,176
Isn't the trailer

461
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:31,968
It's like what was it 5 years ago

462
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,320
The prophet Muhammad cartoons and all these neocon control newspapers

463
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:37,088
In Europe

464
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:39,648
Planet as the Muslims

465
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:40,672
Sure it's wrong

466
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:43,488
Some of the Muslims can't deal with free speech

467
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,512
What

468
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:50,144
It was artificially done

469
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,336
Innocence of Muslims

470
00:27:58,592 --> 00:27:59,616
Just about everything else

471
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:01,920
He's absolutely right that film wasn't

472
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:04,224
A Muslim

473
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:06,016
It was not

474
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:08,832
Whoever he wants

475
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:09,600
2

476
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:14,208
Sign Blazers

477
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:18,048
Christian named Selena

478
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:19,584
Nicole McClain videos

479
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,376
I was trying to make

480
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,400
Call Desert

481
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:25,472
Warrior which is presented as a dystopian

482
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:27,264
Action War Adventure movie

483
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:33,408
In the process of shooting this film imagine

484
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:36,480
Has-beens figures from Islamic history through voice over

485
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:39,552
People acting

486
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:41,344
Pretty offended

487
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,112
Yeah that's not good

488
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:48,768
There were outbreaks of protests in countries like Egypt after the trailer for this

489
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:49,792
Because of it

490
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:51,840
Negative

491
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:55,168
Portrayal of Muhammad in general

492
00:28:55,424 --> 00:29:00,288
Initially the attack on Benghazi was associated with the release of the trailer for this film

493
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:01,568
The call that theory N2 question

494
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:05,920
Director of Innocence

495
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:06,944
Criminal history

496
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:10,784
He was arrested in 1997

497
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,344
Materials used to cook meth

498
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,160
$5,000 in a paper bag

499
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:19,232
Charged with intent to manufacture methamphetamine

500
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:28,960
He pled guilty and was sentenced to a year in jail and a bit of probation 2000

501
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:29,728
You're in prison

502
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:33,568
Pleaded no contest to Federal Bank

503
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,688
Involving

504
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,224
Bank accounts created using

505
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,760
Stolen social security number

506
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,392
790000

507
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:50,464
Anyway

508
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:54,304
Anyway when he got out of prison he started working on

509
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:58,400
Mexican actors into being in a film called Desert Warrior

510
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:01,984
Specifically designed to anger Muslim

511
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:05,824
Unfortunately he tried to direct the film using an alias

512
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,104
Sam Basile

513
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:14,016
Give me the most recent felony conviction had to do with using aliases to commit bank fraud of supervised release

514
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:25,024
You just got

515
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,840
Do it

516
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:32,192
September 2012 was arrested on a charge of probation violation

517
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,544
He reached a plea agreement where for these violations were dropped

518
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,336
Prison per year

519
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:39,616
None of you

520
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:43,456
Probation violation

521
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:47,040
The fraud that he use in order to make it

522
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:51,136
This movie was extreme anti-islam

523
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:53,696
Tater with a rich history of felonies and fraud

524
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:59,328
And Alex's pretending that it was a false flag by the globalist in order to

525
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:01,888
Anger Muslims causing

526
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:08,288
Violence in foreign countries in order to justify a dude

527
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:13,664
Has a history of

528
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,456
Instigating s*** against Muslims which

529
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:16,992
Alex knows

530
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:17,760
A lot of

531
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:19,808
Eyes like that

532
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:24,672
Almost exclusively might not have known nearly as many in 2012

533
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:26,976
It does seem like he does not

534
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:28,512
You do not hate

535
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:30,304
And especially doesn't seem to think

536
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:31,840
That Islam is

537
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:32,864
Is a uniform

538
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:33,632
I'm staying

539
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:40,032
In 2012 he talks about she is SUNY distinction

540
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:43,872
Husband on this episode

541
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:50,272
Is working with her nonsense

542
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:53,600
In the present

543
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,392
Conveniently

544
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:56,416
Sure

545
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:59,744
The movie was made

546
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,512
And that's correct

547
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:02,048
But I was wrong

548
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:03,328
Again about everything else

549
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:07,680
Muhammad movie I can drive fraud I've looked at it yet

550
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:11,520
The way they promote it going

551
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:13,056
5 million

552
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:17,664
The way the press release is written the way no one knows who's behind it

553
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,712
It's meant to antagonize the mug

554
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:25,600
So the claim that the film was financed by wealthy Jews came directly from Saint Basile

555
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:29,440
Is the Alias that in the cooler used in order to create the movie

556
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:32,768
Okay so this guy is a real ship

557
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:40,960
Claimed that he wasn't Israeli receive $5000000 from

558
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:42,240
In order to make the film

559
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:44,032
Course that was all bulshit

560
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:54,528
Subsequent investigations uncovered that the film cross between 50 and $60,000 and receive the money to make it from his wife

561
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:55,296
Nice family

562
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:56,064
Bonita

563
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,112
I wonder how they feel about the whole situation

564
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,720
Alex is taking at face value the claims of a con man

565
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:05,536
Witches

566
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:07,584
About the pecan man

567
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,352
I was trying to

568
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:11,424
That's the f****** story of 2020 right there

569
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:21,408
Is Aveda president

570
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:23,712
Teresa

571
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:24,480
The president

572
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:25,760
Great the nice little fun see

573
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:26,784
Feedback loop or we all die

574
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:28,064
Very annoying

575
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:32,672
Alex believes the CIA

576
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:33,952
Music Man

577
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:36,768
Just a shame that these Muslims are taking the bait

578
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:39,072
It's meant to antagonize

579
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:42,144
Are wild redneck version of Muslim

580
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:44,704
To go out so you're not going to insult my God

581
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:47,008
I mean it is pure manipulation

582
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,544
And the Muslims are taking the bait

583
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:49,568
100

584
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:56,480
Why doesn't this perspective when it comes to like the Satan Temple trying to put up a monument

585
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:58,272
Somewhere

586
00:33:58,784 --> 00:33:59,296
Right

587
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:01,600
You got to fight the devil

588
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:02,880
You can't give the devil

589
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:05,952
Muslims are getting

590
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:06,720
Tricks

591
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:08,768
Because something sacrilegious

592
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:18,752
Satanist Temple when they are actually

593
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:26,432
He's tricking you by thinking you'll be tricked

594
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:30,016
Into thinking that he's sucking with you when it'll actually serious Landing

595
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:31,808
I think that the goal

596
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:34,112
This sort of thing is

597
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:36,928
Generally to make it look like

598
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,976
Complained

599
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:40,512

600
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:41,536

601
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:43,072

602
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:44,864
Tricked into doing it by this

603
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:45,632
Evil group

604
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:47,424
Sure

605
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,960
Yeah he's removing age

606
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:50,496
Dempsey from

607
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:52,544

608
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,312

609
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:56,896
True Lies wife

610

615
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:08,160
You're calling me

616
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:11,232
Billion dollars by Rich Jews

617
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:14,816
MI6

618
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:17,376
They were all involved

619
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:21,216
Just laughing

620
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:23,264
Easter these people up

621
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:30,432
A blue screen on the back Acres at 1

622
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,504
Low budget

623
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,272
Junk

624
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:35,552
5 million mi

625
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,672
Exaggerated

626
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:45,536
Faceless watch

627
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:46,816
And claims that the

628
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:48,352
The CIA did this in Langley

629
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:52,960
Do we have anybody here who can make

630
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:55,264
A really really terrible film

631
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:01,664
That will piss off Muslims know we got to call Blackwater that we need to hire an outside

632
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,968
Propaganda film

633
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:04,992
Nonsense

634
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:10,880
Because we've been dumped down because of

635
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:13,952
TV TV confusing people

636
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:21,376
I seen a jaywalking episodes where people can't even find the US on a world map

637
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:24,960
Joke

638
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:26,240
It is a joke

639
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,312
Television

640
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:31,872
You turn on television all of it is a destructive message

641
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:33,408
The New Normal

642
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,504
Lifestyle

643
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:41,856
But you know what my kids can't watch television

644
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:43,648
Because you want to confuse

645
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,304
Anti family

646
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,096
Abortion anti-gun

647
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:53,376
Call big government

648
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:56,448
Up

649
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:59,776
Trying to make sure that people get confused

650
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:01,312
Make sure

651
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:05,408
And what did the government documents Club around other said they said they would promote

652
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:07,456
Homosexuality in all this

653
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:09,760
In the family so no one

654
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:11,552
Add families to stand together

655
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:15,392
It seems like you're trying to make this a really Broad

656
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:22,304
The media is tricking everybody and your focus complaint seems to be on you.

657
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:23,584
Seeing

658
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:27,168
People who are lgbtq

659
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:33,056

663
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:42,784
From before 1964

664
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:43,808
That's how I do it

665
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:47,392
That's the only way it seems like

666
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:48,928
Interesting

667
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,424
Masquerade what is just like yours

668
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,192
Discomfort

669
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:03,264
You are on come

670
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:10,176
It is annoying to hear arguments from sucking

671
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:14,528
The late 1960s about how televisions going to ruin us all repackage

672
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:18,368
Just so you don't want to see a gay person I want to watch The New Normal

673
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:22,976
Can't nobody come on

675
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:26,560

I am angry

677
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,424
Foregoing in

Chemicals in your food

681
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:37,056
Thousands of daddy

682
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,872

I Ain't Mad At The Globe list

686
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:48,320
For making you gay

687
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:56,768
I don't hate you for being gay I just can't acknowledge that there's any possibility

688
00:38:57,024 --> 00:39:03,168
Person and not the creation of my ultimate what do you not understand we're not about you

689
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:08,800
Structure of the family

690
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:15,200
I don't get it I don't hate you for being gay I just refuse to believe that anyone is actually gay if they were

691
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:19,040
Would just eat real food me and not watch TV

692
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,904
It's not that I hate you it's that I don't think you're a person

693
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,464
Just figure entirely invalid

694

I don't hate you for what you do

697
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:47,968
Actually bought

698
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:03,840
You better computer chip put into the base of your neck

699
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:05,632
Very weird

700
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:07,168
Interesting

701
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:09,728

Field pieces that he has and he plays

706

They are

707
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:23,552
So much more like local news

708
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:27,136

00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:40,448
Liberals

711
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:44,032
I think I think part of that

712
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:49,920
I don't know if it happened after Owen Shroyer

713
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:52,224
Making videos of himself going to protest

714
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:58,624
Yelling at people and I think some of that

715
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:06,048
Jakari Jackson actually getting

716
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:06,816

Here on the broadcast

741
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:10,815
I didn't hear that one but I imagine it's not nearly as

742
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:11,839
Professional

743
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:14,399
The Kraken going out to

744
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:15,679

Suggestion and idea

757
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:06,367
Ron Paul shouldn't run for

758
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:07,135
Governor

759
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:08,671
We should do a right

00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:09,439
Campaign

761
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:11,999

Justrite Ron Paul's name in

00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:19,423
If we can't get him as president

765
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:21,471
It'll show them that we're not

766
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:23,263

00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:36,575
I did not

770
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:37,599
Appreciate your call

771
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:38,623
Appreciate

772
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:41,695
Screen your calls but sometimes I say

773
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:43,487
Hey we're open the phones.

774
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:46,303
What's your take

775
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:48,863
On the situation in

776
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:50,911
East

777
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:52,191
Alex does not

778
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:53,215
Seem to walk

779
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:55,007
To talk about Ron Paul

780
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:55,775
It doesn't seem like

781
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:59,103
That's weird for me because I've listened to his episodes

782
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:03,967
After 2012 and he's love Ron Paul Douglas episodes

783
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:06,783
2012 during the primaries in the election

784
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:09,343
Innseason Resort

785
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:11,135
I know that before he loved

786
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:13,695
Trump you was pushing for Grandpa

787
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:16,255
16 election

788
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:19,327
Strange to me that

789
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:24,191
Very weird to me that he doesn't want to talk about Ron Paul

790
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:27,519
He doesn't let that be a mystery

791
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:31,359
A lot of time complaining about Ron Paul

792
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:33,407
Your call tonight

793
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:41,855
Here's the deal

794
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:43,903
Initially

795
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:46,719
Whenever Ramsay endorse Ramen

796
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:47,743
We got really upset

797
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:49,279
And it was because I watch

798
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:51,839
Behind the scenes

799
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:55,935
Not go after Romney

800
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:59,775
Admitted by Doug wead

801
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:01,567
Top of the campaign

802
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:04,127
Decision

803
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:10,015
Interesting

804
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:10,783
Jessie

805
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:15,391
Guy worked on Ron Paul's campaign

806
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:16,415
Tatum

807
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:19,999
Alex's into standard

808
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:21,535
Like this person can't even talk

809
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:23,327
Barely talk

810
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:25,887
Everybody hates

811
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:29,983
He says about Hillary that she says about Biden

812
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:32,031
Sure but I mean his job

813
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:33,311
The only way you can measure

814
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:35,103
Success I imagine is by his own

815
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:38,687
He can talk for 3 hours unabated

816
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:42,527
That's like that would be your measuring stick

817
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:43,295
Checking out

818
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:48,159
Can an hour on my show is like you're at your 33% is good

819
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:50,719
Weird

820
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:51,487
It's just

821
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:54,303
It seems like a guy has got like one

822
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:55,071
Pitch

823
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:56,095
Sure

824
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:57,887
I can't talk

825
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:02,751
Eastern Europeans make out of your face make fun of your

826
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:04,287
Talking

827
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:05,055
Just like

828
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:06,079
He has bad

829
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:10,431
Yeah campaign

830
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:13,759
Somehow

831
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:16,575
John Wick

832
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:18,111
Paul's man

833
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:19,647
I just got to be honest about

834
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:21,695
I'm done talkin about Ron Paul

835
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:25,023
Guys overall

836
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:27,327
I think you're and doing some good work

837
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:28,607
Overall

838
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:30,399
But

839
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:35,775
Call about Ron Paul you're not going to get the responses you got for me

840
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:39,103
You don't want to go there

841
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:40,383
Okay

842
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:42,175
Because I know too

843
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:43,455
He knows too much

844
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:48,831
Vista

845
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:49,855
What is it

846
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:54,975
This is this is fine people

847
00:46:59,071 --> 00:46:59,839
And it is the same

848
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:00,863
Later

849
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:01,631
Of course

850
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:02,655
This is very weird

851
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:08,287
What is the

852
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:10,847
He's mad at everybody that anybody likes hers because

853
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:12,383
The people that you like

854
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:15,199
Actually do the stuff that he thinks that they're going to

855
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:17,503
To do so he blames everybody that works

856
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:21,855
For them without ever realizing that those two why those are the same

857
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:31,327
I'm at this

858
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:33,119
A piece of s***

859
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:34,655
I can't really just

860
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:35,935
Blame him

861
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:40,543
You going along with

862
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:42,847
Alright I'm deeply suspicious

863
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:49,247
Especially considering because it's 20/20

864
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:57,183
Introspective about whether or not you can see

865
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:59,999
Support someone who hires people that you don't like

866
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:01,535
Jessie

867
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:02,303
Is a villain

868
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:04,863
She already said mean things about Jesse

869
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:08,703
I sent you weeks ago you Washington to work the mainline Republican Party

870
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:10,239
Cuz I knew that from inside

871
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:15,359
McConnell

872
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:20,991
To work for Mitch McConnell and

873
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:29,695
Arrangement

874
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:33,279
Who dropped his support for another Republican candidate in favor of Ron Paul

875
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:38,143
Michele Bachmann had support from

876
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:44,287
Senator in Iowa

877
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:45,823
He got paid

878
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:47,359
Discord Ron Paul

879
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:50,687
That's not something I'm going to go down for

880
00:48:54,783 --> 00:49:00,927
Would you do that

881
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:06,303
When recording it was a recording of

882
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:10,911
Story was discussing him for two years while working for McConnell

883
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:12,447
In order to help ramp

884
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:13,471
Chances in 26

885
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:16,543
16 date

886
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:17,567
Ornos water

887
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:21,663
It became part of a campaign to attack McConnell is not a true conservative

888
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:23,199
It's in the 2014 GOP

889
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:29,855
Haven't heard anything about McConnell Center

890
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:30,879
Is conservative Bona fides

891
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:35,231
The involvement of Jessie Benton in McConnell's campaign

892
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:41,887
Macado's mainstream gopod Grassroots

893
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:43,679
Tea party followers

894
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:46,239
Without whatever machinations probably too

895
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:50,847
There's an office right now

896
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:51,871
Because you would have lost

897
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:52,639
Sapori

898
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:54,431
Of the Tea Party ad

899
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:55,455
Folks

900
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:56,735
Hit Jesse Benton

901
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:58,783
Helped bring along

902
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:01,087
Do you know this is a lot like

903
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:03,903
To me like when you find it when the

904
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:05,183
Is

905
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:10,815
Stupid cop worked on then has to be

906
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:12,863
Re-examine

907
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:15,423
The system campaign manager

908
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:16,447
Ghost

909
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:17,215
To jail

910
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:21,055
All campaign should have to be like I don't think you are.

911
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:30,015
Leave your hands away and be like I do you know you got away with that one

912
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:31,039
No

913
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:37,439
If he's even committed the crime for his state senator for Ron Paul's field for the primaries

914
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:41,023
Getsupport away from Michele Bachmann

915
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:44,351
Times come on

916
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:47,423
I don't know if this makes

917
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:54,335
Is technically Ron Paul's grandson married to Ron Paul's granddaughter

918
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:57,663
So you

919
00:50:58,687 --> 00:51:00,479
And just because we should

920
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:02,271
In March 2016 it was announced

921
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:03,551
The Great America PAC

922
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:04,575
A major Trump

923
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:08,159
Chief strategist

924
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:11,999
In an article about the higher duckweed

925
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:18,399
I think Jesse is one of the best political Minds in the country

926
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:22,751
He understands the cross-section of an outsider in the political establishment

927
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:29,663
In October 2016 Jesse Benton was caught in a sting operation agreeing to launder $2000000 in

928
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:30,687
Donations from a

929
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:32,991
Big Chinese National

930
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:34,015
Consulting company

931
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:36,831
Ultimately

932
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:39,391
It is too easy to trap me

933
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:42,719
Do you know what it is this is evidence

934
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:48,607
Apparatus is geared towards protecting conservatives with a lot of money

935
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:50,399
Because it feels like so far

936
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:55,775
Based on every investigation that we actually take operative

937
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:00,639
We're the guys just have to be like okay well we're going to

938
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:01,407
Record

939
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:07,807
And then they're like wheel of committing crimes take that two million

940
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:11,391
It's too easy

941
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:16,767
Button on your phone every time you go see

942
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:19,583
Does semen

943
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:24,191
Because Jess is actually involved

944
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:24,959
Gunship

945
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:29,823
Criminal

946
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:36,479
Jesse was in the poll campaign to birds Mainline

947
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:37,759
To support Trump

948
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:40,575
And very very very

949
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:42,367
Alex

950
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:43,903
Is the real deal

951
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:45,439
Seahawks

952
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:48,767
But Alex cannot forgive

953
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:51,071
I we always seen the video

954
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:52,863
Call Beth

955
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:55,423
That was snubbed by the Paul's everybody

956
00:52:58,751 --> 00:52:59,775
We seen the footage

957
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:02,847
Peter Schiff

958
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:04,127
Jesse Benton

959
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:06,175
Don't go to Paul past its extremist

960
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:11,551
Nepal's kind of get married

961
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:14,367
Republican establishment and try to influence

962
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:16,671
Libertarianism

963
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:18,207
I get all that to assert

964
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:21,023
What the

965
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:23,327
Talking and acting like

966
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:24,607
La Center

967
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:33,567
And all the things that happened

968
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:38,431
This is very sad to see

969
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:42,271
After all this great work done and that we've done supporting

970
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:43,807
Patriots out there

971
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:46,111
To just kind of see campaign for Liberty

972
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:48,671
And the whole political list of donors

973
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:51,999
Felicitations

974
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:53,535
Out there

975
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:57,119
This is what it's actually about

976
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:58,143
Interested cuz I can

977
00:53:58,399 --> 00:53:59,935
I don't know if

978
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:03,007
Is Jessie Benton told Ron Paul DePaul faster

979
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:06,591
If I were in

980
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:07,871
Position

981
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:08,639
And I

982
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:11,199
Viewed myself as a competent strategist

983
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:12,479
Do not go there

984
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:16,831
I wouldn't

985
00:54:18,879 --> 00:54:19,391
Bad

986
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:21,439
Don't go to that

987
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:33,983
Maybe 18.

988
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:40,127
I don't think even if he's president anymore

989
00:54:40,383 --> 00:54:41,919
I still think it would look bad

990
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:52,671
Hunter S Thompson drug

991
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:57,279
The great idea

992
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:02,655
It comes down to

993
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:04,703
He believes the Jesse Benton

994
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:09,311
Being brought into the McConnell campaign because he has

995
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:10,335
The donor list

996
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:14,431
Sure from the Paul campaign

997
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:16,735
Text for money and he didn't like it

998
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:20,575
Some reality

999
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:22,879
The world

1000
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:24,927
Politics

1001
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:27,743
Working as a

1002
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:30,303
Like a producer of shows here in Chicago

1003
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:33,887
50

1004
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:35,679
Totally be able to use

1005
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:38,239
To promote their shows

1006
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:44,639
And those were highly valued commodity talk about other producers who had

1007
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:47,199
Giant list

1008
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:47,967
Together

1009
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:50,527
It is something

1010
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:53,087
Capital 8

1011
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:55,135
Sanders mailing list after

1012
00:55:57,183 --> 00:56:00,511
16 was incredibly valuable to Hillary

1013
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:03,327
One person has

1014
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:05,119
Control over it I don't

1015
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:10,239
No

1016
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,359
Just for this list

1017
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:16,383
Seems weird

1018
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:20,479
Trying to actually say

1019
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:21,503
You want

1020
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:22,271
What's you

1021
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:23,295
That like

1022
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:24,319
McConnell

1023
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:27,391
Your support

1024
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:30,463
Conover

1025
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:36,351
Kind of a spiritual truth to that a little bit and I think Alex takes it very personally

1026
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:37,375
Because

1027
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:38,143
He owned

1028
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:43,007
Write that his money bomb

1029
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:44,287
Like big

1030
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:46,847
Most of the support is from Infowars

1031
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:47,615
Alex

1032
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:51,455
Mini drone parts

1033
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:56,063
So I think that he's taking the really really personalized

1034
00:56:56,575 --> 00:56:58,367
Mitch McConnell tires Ron Paul

1035
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:03,999
To run his campaign were committed to running a presidential campaign in Kentucky

1036
00:57:04,511 --> 00:57:06,303
And that starts with a presidential campaign manager

1037
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:07,839
McConnell said the statement

1038
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:09,887
Jesse is literally the best in the business

1039
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:12,447
Organization

1040
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:17,823
Constitutional

1041
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:20,127
Narsapur

1042
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:22,943
List over the Republican Party

1043
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:23,711
Mitch McConnell

1044
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:26,527
God done talking about this

1045
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:32,927
People calling about the throw up on the radio okay

1046
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:34,207
So just please

1047
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:34,975
Don't

1048
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:36,767
Don't

1049
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:40,351
And I'm not going there

1050
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:45,215
Tell me what you call Shelby

1051
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:55,199
If he was drunk that is it is it is nice to see you still profession

1052
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:55,967
Chanel backpack

1053
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:58,015
To the point where he's mad but he's not

1054
00:57:58,271 --> 00:57:59,039
Throwing a drug test

1055
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:01,599
This can come off

1056
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:06,207
If you look at it I think about it a little bit

1057
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:10,047
The same time

1058
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:11,839
Has underpinnings

1059
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:12,863
Selma

1060
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:17,983
Something to stop the trail

1061
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:20,031
I agree with him

1062
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:22,335
There's a part of me that's like

1063
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:23,871
You understand how does it have

1064
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:25,663
You understand how the

1065
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:26,431
These people work

1066
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:28,735
You know like this guy's job is

1067
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:30,271
To sell your information to

1068
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:31,551
Many different people

1069
00:58:31,807 --> 00:58:34,111
Any of whom I buy it or not

1070
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:36,927
It says he's going to go run a campaign

1071
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:39,999
Mikado he doesn't give a s***

1072
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:44,095
This dude

1073
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:49,983
Even when we indicating that he thought it was

1074
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:53,567
Thing to do to help ramp 2016

1075
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:57,919
Still on the team

1076
00:58:58,687 --> 00:59:00,991
An argument could be made that Alex is taking Eliquis

1077
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:02,527
Credibly narrow view of

1078
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:08,671
But which is something that people don't say about out whatever

1079
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:12,255
It's really funny to hear him say stuff like that

1080
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:16,095
Nepal got Starstruck rampal got old

1081
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:18,655
They sell off in the sunset

1082
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:19,935
And their hook

1083
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:28,895
And all those families at Paul faster scum

1084
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:31,711
Those families

1085
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:33,759
Guy that's who I'm with

1086
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:35,039
American

1087
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:36,575
Mitch McConnell

1088
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:39,391
His rear end

1089
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:44,255
Going to be a long drop

1090
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:50,911
It's interesting because like

1091
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:56,543
Alex is talking about is like

1092
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:57,567
The GOP

1093
00:59:58,591 --> 01:00:00,639
Because of the people like Jesse Benton

1094
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:06,527
To merge the GOP tea party stuff

1095
01:00:07,295 --> 01:00:08,319
That is the work

1096
01:00:10,879 --> 01:00:12,671
Alex to pretend

1097
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:14,719
That he is not doing that

1098
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:18,559
Sprint

1099
01:00:24,191 --> 01:00:24,703
He pretends

1100
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:26,495
He doesn't like the long game

1101
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:29,823
Involved

1102
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:31,103
Plans and like

1103
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:33,151
All kinds of think it's funny

1104
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:34,175
How

1105
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:40,575
Brilliant he sees the globalists are and how their plans are infinitely long and thousands of years and obviously

1106
01:00:40,831 --> 01:00:42,623
Devil is riding them

1107
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:45,951
But anybody on his team who has a plan that last longer than life

1108
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:49,279
Scream for a bit

1109
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:50,815
Yeah

1110
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:51,839
Yelp

1111
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:53,119
So Alex

1112
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:54,655
Like

1113
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:56,959
I mean I think he's making some Fair

1114
01:00:57,215 --> 01:00:58,239
Critiques of the Paul

1115
01:00:59,007 --> 01:01:02,335
Pretended to be more serious

1116
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:05,919
About their chances in order to make money

1117
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:11,295
What is somebody I don't know does me wrong I it's not personal I don't get upset

1118
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:12,063
Russian fly

1119
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:15,135
We wore

1120
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:16,415
Passionate

1121
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:18,463
Shell mods

1122
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:19,999
Or someone

1123
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:22,303
And watch him really turn their back

1124
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:30,239
Rope-a-dope keep everybody going along

1125
01:01:31,007 --> 01:01:32,031
Was going to be president

1126
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:34,079
Wonderland was already announcing and

1127
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:37,663
5 months ago

1128
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:40,223
Decided

1129
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:44,575
Embassy was all just an exercise in

1130
01:01:45,343 --> 01:01:48,159
And capitalizing on political

1131
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:49,183
Yes

1132
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:55,583
Man

1133
01:01:56,351 --> 01:01:57,887
High tide it's weird

1134
01:01:59,167 --> 01:02:02,239
To realize that I was more jaded 8 years ago

1135
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:06,335
Somehow I was like

1136
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:18,623
Everyone's polish

1137
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:22,207
And even if everything isn't there is still just

1138
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:29,119
Intricacies in complicated ways in which things can be done that maybe

1139
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:32,191
You can't capture in campaign

1140
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:35,775
That aren't necessarily deceit

1141
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:39,615
Alex is realizing the Ron Paul

1142
01:02:39,871 --> 01:02:40,383
Was fundraise

1143
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:43,455
Wow

1144
01:02:43,711 --> 01:02:48,575
Doesn't really thought Andrew yang

1145
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:54,975
Revolution rail

1146
01:02:58,303 --> 01:02:58,815
Punk

1147
01:02:59,071 --> 01:03:00,095
Married Ron Paul's granddaughter

1148
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:00,863

Things to discuss

1167
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:06,655
Like Trump's connection to Peter Thiel

1168
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:08,703
I can't I can't imagine

1169
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:10,495
Being where Alex is right now

1170
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:12,031

Play some clips of the news

Hubbub

01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:15,263
Has been dropping going back on

1191
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:16,543
That was

1192
01:05:17,055 --> 01:05:19,615
That was a good job build up and not have the gas there

1193
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:20,639
Newfoundlands are weird

1194
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:22,943
Sure are weird

1195
01:05:23,455 --> 01:05:26,015
How many years can you handle that many phone Miss have

1196
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:28,063
8 years

1197
01:05:34,207 --> 01:05:35,999
Cross our fingers and hope it works tomorrow

1198
01:05:36,511 --> 01:05:39,839
Are you saying I mean like this is one of the only shows where this is such a

1199
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:41,631
Constant problem

1200
01:05:44,447 --> 01:05:46,751
These kinds of things ironed out fairly well

1201
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:48,287
Particularly

1202
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:51,871
Gas to baby used to be the governor of a state

1203
01:05:52,127 --> 01:05:53,919
It's noticeable whenever somebody with a

1204
01:05:54,175 --> 01:05:55,455
The professional show has it called

1205
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:57,503
What are you like

1206
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:00,575
Oh no this is a

1207
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:01,343
Nightmare

1208
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:02,111
Not like

1209
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:04,415
Well

1210
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:09,535
This is Wednesday

1211
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:12,607
The phones are weird

1212
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:15,167
Wipeout

1213
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:19,007
Exactly

1214
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:26,943
Text talk and Alex

1215
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:27,967
Is a good idea

1216
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:31,039
I end up losing respect for Jesse

1217
01:06:31,295 --> 01:06:32,319
Every time I hear him

1218
01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:36,671
I think he's one of these guys who benefits from people having it

1219
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:41,023
Picture of him

1220
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:45,887
He's a guy who likes doesn't like spiders

1221
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:48,191
If you just

1222
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:50,495
Then you can be like yeah

1223
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:56,895
Phuc yea Ventura you didn't like special interest to near the governor

1224
01:06:57,151 --> 01:07:00,735
Predator

1225
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:01,503
Yeah

1226
01:07:01,759 --> 01:07:02,527
That's great

1227
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:07,903
But then when you start to get into like more specifics and then I can wait you suck

1228
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:09,951
I stand with Ron

1229
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:10,975
Completely

1230
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:12,511
We need to cut off

1231
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:14,559
Who made to any phone

1232
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:16,863
We need to do it for Natalie

1233
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:19,679
Economic reasons

1234
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:21,983
Our country's broke

1235
01:07:24,543 --> 01:07:25,823
Like Ron Paul W Gray

1236
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:27,871
That's a great it's a great realistic

1237
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:30,943
Consequence-free kind of idea

1238
01:07:34,783 --> 01:07:35,295
Shut then

1239
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:38,111
I talk a lot of s*** I have a lot of bad ideas

1240
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:43,999
You know whatever this stuff happens whenever I'm lit it's like a

1241
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:46,047
We should cut off all foreign aid

1242
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:50,655
It's never pointed out Slater

1243
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:55,519
For them

1244
01:07:55,775 --> 01:07:58,591
Okay well here's what would happen and I go that's a bad idea

1245
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:04,735
Typical

1246
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:08,063
You one of your ideas is shown to be bad you like bad idea

1247
01:08:10,623 --> 01:08:16,255
Knock-Knock Jesse Ron Paul zeise

1248
01:08:16,511 --> 01:08:17,023
Difference

1249
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:20,607
Cuz I think between me and most of the right way

1250
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:22,143
Although you would not be on the right

1251
01:08:22,655 --> 01:08:24,191
Because he thinks that there are

1252
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:27,007
Democrats and Republicans

1253
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:34,431
Just say that everything that she brings up is Dahmer

1254
01:08:36,735 --> 01:08:39,039
The Advocate cutting off

1255
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:39,807
Pretty tops

1256
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:43,135
Balance the scales believe that

1257
01:08:43,391 --> 01:08:44,415
Take a whole lot of

1258
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:49,791
It may be an impossible number of a good opinion

1259
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:50,815
Stop world hunger

1260
01:08:51,071 --> 01:08:51,839
And I think

1261
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:54,911
I don't think those two work well together

1262
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:59,519
Dishonest

1263
01:09:02,335 --> 01:09:05,151
Complain about Obama

1264
01:09:05,663 --> 01:09:06,175
Is the remnant

1265
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:07,967
Things that work on during

1266
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:08,991
Sure

1267
01:09:09,247 --> 01:09:12,319
Because fries

1268
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:13,343
Call Lidia

1269
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:15,903
Memories with the people of this country they can't sing

1270
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:18,719
About a year that they can learn

1271
01:09:18,975 --> 01:09:19,487
Number

1272
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:23,327
Realize that it was difficult the first bailout

1273
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:25,631
It was supposed to start in all the wars

1274
01:09:26,143 --> 01:09:29,215
People meet under submission I speak from experience here

1275
01:09:29,727 --> 01:09:31,007
Yami economy

1276
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:34,335
Which decisions made about 4 years ago

1277
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:35,615
Intercepted today

1278
01:09:36,127 --> 01:09:37,919
So when the economy went sour

1279
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:38,687
2000

1280
01:09:38,943 --> 01:09:41,247
It was decisions made back in

1281
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:42,271
2020

1282
01:09:42,527 --> 01:09:43,551
4 * 5

1283
01:09:43,807 --> 01:09:45,599
About to happen in 08

1284
01:09:45,855 --> 01:09:47,647
It does not happen overnight

1285
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:50,207
Large

1286
01:09:50,463 --> 01:09:53,279
Takes about 3 years or 4 years

1287
01:09:53,535 --> 01:09:54,047
Prediction

1288
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:56,351
Impact on the economy

1289
01:09:59,167 --> 01:09:59,935
Do you

1290
01:10:00,703 --> 01:10:03,263
It's interesting because it's now whenever something

1291
01:10:03,519 --> 01:10:05,311
Week later

1292
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:13,247
So when all the stuff that happened during Obama's years

1293
01:10:13,759 --> 01:10:14,783
Before

1294
01:10:16,063 --> 01:10:16,831
So

1295
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:17,855
Jessica

1296
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:25,535
Becomes a little bit weird

1297
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:33,983
Who started these Wars the first bail out of here at 1 so again

1298
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:37,055
Anime

1299
01:10:42,431 --> 01:10:47,807
You know you don't want to look for Obama for third-party person

1300
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:51,903
At the end of the day

1301
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:53,439
Maybe

1302
01:10:53,695 --> 01:10:54,975
He hates Romney

1303
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:56,511
He's an anti left

1304
01:11:00,351 --> 01:11:00,863
Kimberly

1305
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:02,911
He wants to get on to other topics

1306
01:11:10,591 --> 01:11:12,895
Train stations in bus station starting to pop up

1307
01:11:13,407 --> 01:11:14,943
We've got

1308
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:18,527
Military

1309
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:21,343
4

1310
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:28,511
I don't know obviously something very bad and will transition to my TV show now if we met

1311
01:11:30,559 --> 01:11:36,191
The new season starts November 7th 10 Eastern 9 Central on truTV

1312
01:11:36,703 --> 01:11:41,311
One of the interesting shows we show you this year's in Ozark Missouri

1313
01:11:41,823 --> 01:11:44,639
There's a complete underground city we discovered it

1314
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:53,343
I'm glad you guys did a jarring

1315
01:11:53,599 --> 01:11:54,623
Transition to promotion

1316
01:11:55,135 --> 01:11:57,439
I'm glad you brought that up

1317
01:12:04,863 --> 01:12:11,007
Well I'd like to

1318
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:23,807
Terrible dumb questions

1319
01:12:30,975 --> 01:12:33,535
Remember this episode episode

1320
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:36,095
Conspiracy Theory with Jesse Ventura

1321
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:39,423
I mean that the couch if you want to get high

1322
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:43,775
Go like

1323
01:12:44,031 --> 01:12:46,079
Information it's not great

1324
01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:49,663
Okay go

1325
01:12:49,919 --> 01:12:50,431
F*** yourself Jesse

1326
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:56,319
Well it one of the interesting things here's an interesting thing we found out in Ozark Missouri

1327
01:12:57,087 --> 01:12:57,599
Now

1328
01:12:57,855 --> 01:13:03,999
The only new construction there except for this dick 72000 sqft single-family Drive

1329
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:07,327
Weather there

1330
01:13:08,095 --> 01:13:09,119
That's another story.

1331
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:12,959
The only news things happening in this little town in Missouri is

1332
01:13:13,983 --> 01:13:15,519
The only thing being built

1333
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:19,615
And we promised the kids

1334
01:13:20,127 --> 01:13:21,663
And it goes something like this

1335
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:24,223
One page 411

1336
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:26,271
Thousand people in New York City

1337
01:13:26,783 --> 01:13:27,295
There's one

1338
01:13:27,551 --> 01:13:30,623
9000 people in Los Angeles

1339
01:13:31,135 --> 01:13:32,415
In Ozark Missouri

1340
01:13:32,927 --> 01:13:33,695
There's now one

1341
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:35,999
51 people

1342
01:13:37,535 --> 01:13:39,583
Incredible is it

1343
01:13:39,839 --> 01:13:40,863
Is it incredible

1344
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:47,263
It doesn't feel incredible to me Ozark Missouri is approximately 17800

1345
01:13:47,519 --> 01:13:50,079
A 50-person F350

1346
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:51,615
Key Banks in that town which is

1347
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:54,175
Comical seems like a lot of it

1348
01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:56,223
Infrastructure going to wait

1349
01:13:56,479 --> 01:14:01,343
The former Missouri

1350
01:14:02,111 --> 01:14:04,159
Ozark

1351
01:14:04,415 --> 01:14:07,231
There's also a separate County called Ozark County

1352
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:13,887
Jason city called Lake Ozark

1353
01:14:14,655 --> 01:14:20,287
Is it because the lower house for the state of Missouri a part of Arkansas

1354
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:24,639
Would you been really instrumental in defining culture of those areas in the Midwest

1355
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:27,455
Oftentimes the term of the Ozarks

1356
01:14:27,711 --> 01:14:30,015
Is used to describe the lower half of the state of Missouri

1357
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:33,343
Administrative order significant

1358
01:14:34,367 --> 01:14:39,743
Might be that what's going on here Jesse's taking the number of banks in the Ozark

1359
01:14:40,511 --> 01:14:41,791
Compared to the population of the

1360
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:43,327
The city that's called

1361
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:44,351
And then decided

1362
01:14:44,607 --> 01:14:46,399
The small town in Missouri mysteriously

1363
01:14:46,655 --> 01:14:47,679
350 Bank

1364
01:14:47,935 --> 01:14:48,447
That would make sense

1365
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:53,311
Throughout the southern

1366
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:54,847
451 people because

1367
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:57,151
There could be a bank in a city that's got like

1368
01:14:57,663 --> 01:15:02,271
No papa

1369
01:15:04,063 --> 01:15:07,391
7000

1370
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:09,695
You know a little a little under half

1371
01:15:11,743 --> 01:15:15,327
Man I don't even know if there were 350 total like

1372
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:16,863
Pacific building

1373
01:15:17,119 --> 01:15:19,167
Please.

1374
01:15:19,423 --> 01:15:23,519
I'm not entirely positive that I would be out

1375
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:25,311
There's like 350 Banks

1376
01:15:25,567 --> 01:15:26,335
Do you like

1377
01:15:26,591 --> 01:15:29,919
Bottom half of Missouri seems maybe even

1378
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:31,199
Like a walkie

1379
01:15:31,455 --> 01:15:31,967
Statistic

1380
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:34,527
The idea that this town

1381
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:36,063
Ozark Missouri

1382
01:15:38,111 --> 01:15:39,135
Ridiculous

1383
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:41,695
Situation is ridiculous

1384
01:15:41,951 --> 01:15:42,975
We only sell Banks

1385
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:50,655
Thanks possible reason

1386
01:15:51,167 --> 01:15:53,215
Conspiracy is he even hinting at

1387
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:57,567
I suspected what he's getting at is that there's an underground city which is

1388
01:15:57,823 --> 01:15:59,615
The people Houdini

1389
01:16:00,127 --> 01:16:03,711
Does this make sense at all the surface to bank

1390
01:16:03,967 --> 01:16:05,503
Okay they could do all that digitally

1391
01:16:05,759 --> 01:16:10,879
So that's kind of the angle that I think they're building all these bags

1392
01:16:11,135 --> 01:16:13,439
Right isn't that suspicious who's using those

1393
01:16:13,951 --> 01:16:15,231
Where are those people going

1394
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:16,511
They must be Underground

1395
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:17,791
I think

1396
01:16:18,047 --> 01:16:20,095
That is a trait of thought that I would

1397
01:16:21,631 --> 01:16:22,143
Because it make

1398
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:24,959
I'm just guessing that the conspiracy

1399
01:16:28,031 --> 01:16:30,591
The server's world we must make a withdrawal

1400
01:16:31,103 --> 01:16:33,407
Silly it's legitimately dumb

1401
01:16:34,175 --> 01:16:38,015
Let's imagine

1402
01:16:38,783 --> 01:16:44,927
They have an ATM they could take 11 ATM

1403
01:16:47,231 --> 01:16:47,999
Why can't you

1404
01:16:48,255 --> 01:16:49,535
Construct the underground city

1405
01:16:50,303 --> 01:16:51,839
Why can't you just dig a hole drop it

1406
01:16:52,095 --> 01:16:53,631
Sure why not

1407
01:16:53,887 --> 01:16:56,959
I would like to make a withdrawal paid yes can I have an address

1408
01:16:58,239 --> 01:16:59,007
Hey buddy

1409
01:16:59,263 --> 01:16:59,775
Guess what

1410
01:17:00,031 --> 01:17:01,567
Physical secret underground city

1411
01:17:01,823 --> 01:17:03,615
They don't need money

1412
01:17:04,895 --> 01:17:06,175
They could have

1413
01:17:06,431 --> 01:17:12,575
Everything digital I'd be showing there's no reason

1414
01:17:12,831 --> 01:17:17,183
Sims 4 change the capability

1415
01:17:18,207 --> 01:17:19,487
Underground city

1416
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:29,215
We just didn't think of that we didn't plan ahead 350 Banks put in

1417
01:17:35,103 --> 01:17:39,199
This is so stupid

1418
01:17:39,455 --> 01:17:42,527
It is entertaining or some kind of

1419
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:43,551
Buick

1420
01:17:43,807 --> 01:17:48,927
It's pretty good evidence that either he's checked out on the critical thinking

1421
01:17:49,183 --> 01:17:51,999
Or he's just leaning into like things that are like

1422
01:17:52,511 --> 01:17:54,559
Almost no conspiracy clickbait

1423
01:18:00,447 --> 01:18:00,959
Young you know

1424
01:18:01,215 --> 01:18:03,519
This is just part of that selling the s*** yeah

1425
01:18:07,359 --> 01:18:08,383
I'm doing Alex impression

1426
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:11,199
There's one episode

1427
01:18:11,455 --> 01:18:12,479
I can't do it

1428
01:18:12,735 --> 01:18:14,783
I can't do it

1429
01:18:15,551 --> 01:18:19,903
Do you talk about on what episode they're going to

1430
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:23,231
Government making us humans

1431
01:18:23,743 --> 01:18:24,255
Alex

1432
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:26,815
Because

1433
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:28,863
If you believe Alex's conspiracies

1434
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:30,655
Already done.

1435
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:35,519
For years that I'm doing that salting the Jesse would make an episode about that cuz Alex

1436
01:18:35,775 --> 01:18:38,079
A hundred times over

1437
01:18:38,591 --> 01:18:39,103
So it's

1438
01:18:39,359 --> 01:18:39,871
It's weird

1439
01:18:40,127 --> 01:18:40,895
Yeah that is

1440
01:18:41,407 --> 01:18:44,991
It's not like this is the first time he's ever transparently so

1441
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:46,271
Obvious garbage

1442
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:53,951
Positive I'm a sales are you know I'm a professional Entertainer

1443
01:18:58,815 --> 01:18:59,327
You know it wasn't

1444
01:19:03,423 --> 01:19:04,959
This season's going

1445
01:19:05,215 --> 01:19:06,239
Even more entertaining

1446
01:19:06,495 --> 01:19:07,775
For people to watch

1447
01:19:08,287 --> 01:19:09,567
Because we also get in

1448
01:19:09,823 --> 01:19:11,103
Throughout your body

1449
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:12,895
Are you sure whatever his name is

1450
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:17,247
I wish you guys would have got into a telephone

1451
01:19:18,015 --> 01:19:22,111
Well you don't I would discredit except it was on Time Magazine

1452
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:26,463
I need people to leave here so

1453
01:19:26,975 --> 01:19:29,535
You don't realize are there to show the conspiracy

1454
01:19:29,791 --> 01:19:33,631
Russell dare to show if the conspiracy we believe is a flat

1455
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:39,263
5 1/2 ft Reptoid

1456
01:19:40,543 --> 01:19:41,311
I believe it

1457
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:43,103
No

1458
01:19:43,359 --> 01:19:45,407
They're making fun of

1459
01:19:45,663 --> 01:19:50,783
David Icke now

1460
01:19:51,807 --> 01:19:52,831
2012

1461
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:56,671
David Icke is a turd in the punch bowl

1462
01:19:56,927 --> 01:19:57,951
Mentality

1463
01:20:00,255 --> 01:20:01,791
Pretty good and hard

1464
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:08,191
That's good Jesse's on a promotional tour

1465
01:20:09,727 --> 01:20:14,592
Bye-bye bye-bye

Help get more

30 employees

1469
01:20:24,576 --> 01:20:26,368
Hot news for you not tell you this

50 states

01:20:41,984 --> 01:20:43,776
What is the Grassroots campaign

1477
01:20:44,032 --> 01:20:46,080
Guarantee that I would be in the

1478
01:20:46,336 --> 01:20:46,848
Debates

1479
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:51,456
But I will give serious consideration 2016 is running for president

1480
01:20:52,736 --> 01:20:53,760
Are you breaking out here

1481
01:20:54,784 --> 01:21:00,672
The couple places but you're pretty well out there the same day so your hearing at the same day

Apparent attempt

1485
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:13,728
Wow

1486
01:21:15,008 --> 01:21:16,544
Brutal

1487
01:21:18,336 --> 01:21:21,920
Like if you actually listen to what he said he said nothing

1488
01:21:26,016 --> 01:21:30,368
He's guaranteed guaranteed

1489
01:21:30,624 --> 01:21:35,232
To be in

1490
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:43,936
If I am 75% elected already I'll think about it

1491
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:45,984
25% of

1492

Really clear that

1496
01:22:00,832 --> 01:22:06,976
I will show up and yell at people at the debate if everyone else does the hard work for me

1497
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:11,584
I'll do the fun park

1498
01:22:12,096 --> 01:22:14,912
Probably

1499
01:22:15,424 --> 01:22:17,216
I forgot

1500
01:22:17,728 --> 01:22:20,544
Well I slept it it's a Grassroots effort

1501
01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:22,592
Not a money approach I don't want

1502
01:22:22,848 --> 01:22:25,920
I want millions of dollars raised and I don't want to do all that

1503
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:27,968
Glass roof

Because I've got to be in the debate

1510
01:22:42,816 --> 01:22:45,376
If I can't have an opportunity to win

1511
01:22:46,144 --> 01:22:48,448
And the only way you can have an opportunity to win

1512
01:22:49,728 --> 01:22:51,520
Be included in the debate

1513
01:22:51,776 --> 01:22:53,824

01:23:04,576 --> 01:23:05,856
Very strong

1518
01:23:06,112 --> 01:23:09,696
Even in your imaginary world that is not

1519
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:13,792
Possible

1520
01:23:14,048 --> 01:23:15,328
Look if all

1521
01:23:15,584 --> 01:23:17,888
If hundreds of thousands of policy

1522
01:23:18,144 --> 01:23:21,216
Email comedy Central's head of programming

1523
01:23:21,472 --> 01:23:22,240
Right now

1524
01:23:22,496 --> 01:23:25,824
Telling them that I deserve a half-hour comedy special

1525
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:28,384
I will strongly consider recording

1526
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:30,432
Comedy special

1527
01:23:34,272 --> 01:23:37,088
Comparable between those two is they're taking out the difficult

1528
01:23:38,624 --> 01:23:44,768
Hundreds of thousands of people at my stand-up comedy career for 10

1529
01:23:48,864 --> 01:23:53,216
The hard part about a Grassroots movement is organization mobilization

1530
01:23:57,056 --> 01:23:58,336
Ideal you would want

1531
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:01,664
That part of the process

1532
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:04,992
No

1533
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:09,856
To me looking back

1534
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:16,256
What places

1535
01:24:18,816 --> 01:24:21,632
He's doing a bunch of these last

1536
01:24:21,888 --> 01:24:23,424
Express strategy

1537
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:29,824
Is indicating that if people want

1538
01:24:32,128 --> 01:24:34,432
What a dick it's not it's not hard

1539
01:24:34,688 --> 01:24:35,456
Just not hard

1540
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:38,016
It should be harder to manipulate

1541
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:47,232
For every 6000

1542
01:24:47,744 --> 01:24:48,256
True

1543
01:24:50,048 --> 01:24:51,072
On this episode

1544
01:24:54,656 --> 01:24:56,192
People think that I'm a witch

1545
01:24:57,728 --> 01:24:58,496
Alright

1546
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:02,336
Intown a couple days ago

1547
01:25:03,616 --> 01:25:08,736
The world

1548
01:25:16,672 --> 01:25:19,744
Trailblazer the grandfather other all 30 plus years

1549
01:25:20,256 --> 01:25:23,328
The biggest company the best company all of that

1550
01:25:24,096 --> 01:25:25,888
You got all these fly-by-night people now

1551
01:25:26,144 --> 01:25:28,960
Coming into storable

1552
01:25:32,288 --> 01:25:34,080
Two things about that

1553
01:25:36,384 --> 01:25:38,176
Steve shank was going to be on

1554
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:39,968
Food

1555
01:25:40,224 --> 01:25:41,504
The BMW episode

1556
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:46,368
Which text his desire for calls to come in about World War 3

1557
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:49,184
Financial collapse that's coming

1558
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:52,256
You wanted to create that tone for the episode

1559
01:25:52,512 --> 01:25:54,560
In order to pay it off towards the end

1560
01:25:55,840 --> 01:26:00,704
See we've just heard from all of our colors that World War 3 is coming

1561
01:26:01,728 --> 01:26:05,568
Steve do you have anything that people might want if the financial collapse is coming

1562
01:26:05,824 --> 01:26:07,360
Second

1563
01:26:07,616 --> 01:26:08,384
He's talking about

1564
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:12,224
Space

1565
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:14,528
They're not around.

1566
01:26:16,064 --> 01:26:17,600
Direct

1567
01:26:18,624 --> 01:26:19,392
They're not big on

1568
01:26:19,648 --> 01:26:22,208
I can't find any evidence

1569
01:26:22,464 --> 01:26:23,232
I found a bunch of

1570
01:26:23,488 --> 01:26:24,000
People who are

1571
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:27,584
Are not in business anymore

1572
01:26:28,096 --> 01:26:28,864
8/3

1573
01:26:30,144 --> 01:26:30,912
They're not Alex's

1574
01:26:31,168 --> 01:26:32,448
Sponsor anymore

1575
01:26:32,704 --> 01:26:33,984
Alex

1576
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:34,752
Supply

1577
01:26:35,008 --> 01:26:36,288
He has a completely different

1578
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:37,568
Food sponsor

1579
01:26:37,824 --> 01:26:39,104
It's interesting

1580
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:39,872
It's

1581
01:26:41,408 --> 01:26:42,944
This very similar Behavior being

1582
01:26:43,456 --> 01:26:45,248
Engaged in in order to push

1583
01:26:45,504 --> 01:26:46,272
Survival food

1584
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:48,832
Yeah it's almost like

1585
01:26:49,088 --> 01:26:51,392
Callers were the three main game

1586
01:26:51,648 --> 01:26:54,208
You know used to be him Ted Anderson to end

1587
01:26:58,048 --> 01:26:59,584
Enroll

1588
01:27:00,096 --> 01:27:01,120
Look at what

1589
01:27:01,376 --> 01:27:04,960
The horrible things might come

1590
01:27:05,216 --> 01:27:05,984
Discuss

1591
01:27:06,752 --> 01:27:08,800
Honestly

1592
01:27:09,056 --> 01:27:15,200
Trying to figure out what was going on figure out why Alex doesn't have you food the directors as

1593
01:27:21,088 --> 01:27:21,856
Really f******.

1594
01:27:23,136 --> 01:27:24,416
And I think

1595
01:27:24,672 --> 01:27:26,720
Aspect of survival food sales

1596
01:27:26,976 --> 01:27:29,280
That we don't take into consideration that much

1597
01:27:29,792 --> 01:27:31,328
How ripe

1598
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:32,608
For abuse

1599
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:33,632
Oh yeah

1600
01:27:33,888 --> 01:27:37,984
Because the premise is your buying food that you won't eat for 5 years

1601
01:27:38,496 --> 01:27:40,800
If you're somebody was running a condo

1602
01:27:41,056 --> 01:27:45,152
Expect to be in business in 5 years you been time whatever the f*** you want cuz

1603
01:27:45,408 --> 01:27:47,712
People are not going to eat that

1604
01:27:48,224 --> 01:27:49,248
It could be bad

1605
01:27:49,504 --> 01:27:53,088
And then it might not have the shelf life that you're claiming that it has

1606
01:27:56,672 --> 01:27:57,440
You're out of business

1607
01:27:57,696 --> 01:27:59,488
You've disappeared there's nothing they can do

1608
01:28:00,256 --> 01:28:00,768
I found

1609
01:28:01,024 --> 01:28:02,048
So many come

1610
01:28:03,072 --> 01:28:03,840
On website

1611
01:28:04,096 --> 01:28:06,656
From people who'd bought food from efoodsdirect

1612
01:28:07,168 --> 01:28:12,800
And you know it's got a 25-year shelf life or something

1613
01:28:13,056 --> 01:28:14,848
Even more tragically

1614
01:28:15,104 --> 01:28:15,616
Now

1615
01:28:15,872 --> 01:28:18,176
In 2020 with the situation

1616
01:28:18,432 --> 01:28:19,712
People are finding themselves in

1617
01:28:19,968 --> 01:28:21,760
We have survival food

1618
01:28:23,808 --> 01:28:24,832
They open it up

1619
01:28:25,088 --> 01:28:25,600
Rams

1620
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:27,904
Completely spoiled

1621
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:29,184
The food is no good

1622
01:28:29,696 --> 01:28:32,000
I found a complaint from

1623
01:28:34,816 --> 01:28:35,840
Did their food don't have

1624
01:28:36,096 --> 01:28:37,120
Bug proof bags

1625
01:28:37,632 --> 01:28:39,680
Oh

1626
01:28:39,936 --> 01:28:46,080
Just had just passed Universal

1627
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:48,128
II

1628
01:28:48,384 --> 01:28:49,152
Generally

1629
01:28:49,408 --> 01:28:51,456
Try to err on the side of not taking

1630
01:28:51,712 --> 01:28:52,224
Angry

1631
01:28:52,736 --> 01:28:53,248
Online

1632
01:28:53,504 --> 01:28:57,344
Comments to seriously easy to for people to

1633
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:58,368
Create

1634
01:28:59,904 --> 01:29:02,976
Campaigns against company whatever

1635
01:29:03,232 --> 01:29:03,744
But

1636
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,816
It was over a long stretch of time

1637
01:29:07,072 --> 01:29:08,096
Complaints

1638
01:29:08,352 --> 01:29:09,376
They were also

1639
01:29:09,632 --> 01:29:10,144
A lot of them

1640
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:14,752
It made me think maybe there was something to some of the complaints were making

1641
01:29:15,264 --> 01:29:16,544
And it really really depressed

1642
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:17,312
Because

1643
01:29:20,896 --> 01:29:21,664
You are

1644
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:22,432
Your base

1645
01:29:22,688 --> 01:29:23,200
Basically

1646
01:29:23,456 --> 01:29:24,992
People comfort

1647
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:27,552
That they may not have

1648
01:29:27,808 --> 01:29:28,320
In the future

1649
01:29:28,576 --> 01:29:29,600
Sure

1650
01:29:31,648 --> 01:29:32,416
These

1651
01:29:32,672 --> 01:29:33,184
People

1652
01:29:33,952 --> 01:29:34,976
Like it's not cheap

1653
01:29:35,744 --> 01:29:39,840
It's a lot of money people were paying thousands of dollars

1654
01:29:40,352 --> 01:29:40,864
4

1655
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:44,704
You know a family of five a Year's worth of food

1656
01:29:45,216 --> 01:29:45,984
MN

1657
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:47,008
Maybe it's

1658
01:29:47,264 --> 01:29:47,776
S***

1659
01:29:48,032 --> 01:29:48,544
Maybe it's

1660
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:49,312
Useless

1661
01:29:49,824 --> 01:29:51,104
And now you're out money

1662
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:52,896
And you've been deprived

1663
01:29:53,152 --> 01:29:54,176
Comfort

1664
01:29:54,432 --> 01:29:56,736
That you were being sold

1665
01:29:56,992 --> 01:29:57,504
In the first place

1666
01:29:58,016 --> 01:29:59,552
It really made me more angry

1667
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:00,832
Because

1668
01:30:01,088 --> 01:30:04,416
On some level I totally understand the idea of preparation

1669
01:30:04,928 --> 01:30:06,720
I made a we've talked about this before like

1670
01:30:06,976 --> 01:30:08,512
When I was younger we lived

1671
01:30:08,768 --> 01:30:10,304
Missouri and there's tornado

1672
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:14,656
Bottled water in the basement

1673
01:30:14,912 --> 01:30:16,448
In case I understand

1674
01:30:17,216 --> 01:30:17,984
It's something

1675
01:30:18,752 --> 01:30:21,056
If things go as bad as they possibly could

1676
01:30:21,312 --> 01:30:22,848
It's not irrational

1677
01:30:23,104 --> 01:30:23,616
To have

1678
01:30:24,128 --> 01:30:24,640
Something

1679
01:30:26,176 --> 01:30:27,712
When a company exist

1680
01:30:28,224 --> 01:30:29,504
Promising you

1681
01:30:30,272 --> 01:30:31,296
The relief

1682
01:30:31,552 --> 01:30:32,320
Those

1683
01:30:32,576 --> 01:30:34,368
Potential fears and anxieties

1684
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:36,928
When that's what they exist to do

1685
01:30:37,184 --> 01:30:38,976
And they take advantage

1686
01:30:39,488 --> 01:30:40,768
It's really bad

1687
01:30:42,048 --> 01:30:42,560
Tomato

1688
01:30:44,864 --> 01:30:47,680
I would say a day just on that marriage

1689
01:30:47,936 --> 01:30:48,960
Yes it's disgusting

1690
01:30:49,472 --> 01:30:50,496
When you add the fact

1691
01:30:50,752 --> 01:30:51,264
Text that they are

1692
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:52,800
Then stoking Anna

1693
01:30:53,056 --> 01:30:54,336
Exacerbating the fear

1694
01:30:54,592 --> 01:30:57,152
In order to

1695
01:30:57,408 --> 01:30:59,712
Now you're not just saying

1696
01:30:59,968 --> 01:31:00,736
They're at

1697
01:31:00,992 --> 01:31:02,528
Exploding somebody's reasonable Sears

1698
01:31:02,784 --> 01:31:06,112
What they're doing is there ratcheting up reasonable fears into something

1699
01:31:06,368 --> 01:31:08,416
Insane yeah order to

1700
01:31:08,672 --> 01:31:10,208
Sell more of their food because

1701
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:12,000
That's how capitalism

1702
01:31:12,256 --> 01:31:18,144
Also a multi-level marketing

1703
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:20,448
Call Angela

1704
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:25,312
Stephen Morris

1705
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:27,360
Just the all of the indications

1706
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:32,224
This is a really really gross

1707
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:43,232
Unless no because I'm too depressed

1708
01:31:43,488 --> 01:31:44,000
I know it's very

1709
01:31:47,072 --> 01:31:48,352
Alex is talking about this

1710
01:31:48,608 --> 01:31:49,632
In terms of like

1711
01:31:49,888 --> 01:31:52,192
Getting into the emergency

1712
01:31:52,448 --> 01:31:54,240
Seafood games

1713
01:31:54,496 --> 01:31:55,008
The independent

1714
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:57,568
That's an illusion

1715
01:31:57,824 --> 01:32:02,688
You're creating a dependency on your company

1716
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:07,040
And if you can't promise you can't deliver what you're promising

1717
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:13,184
Picture of

1718
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:15,744
Like Alex selling x-ray

1719
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:19,072
Goggles in the back of his magazine or whatever like

1720
01:32:19,328 --> 01:32:19,840
Just

1721
01:32:20,096 --> 01:32:21,888
It's just such charlatans

1722
01:32:22,144 --> 01:32:23,680
Camry that I

1723
01:32:25,216 --> 01:32:27,776
Find the fences it's so much of his career

1724
01:32:28,032 --> 01:32:28,800
Nearly staked

1725
01:32:29,312 --> 01:32:31,360
Clearly based on

1726
01:32:33,152 --> 01:32:36,480
None of these people who do trust him

1727
01:32:36,992 --> 01:32:40,320
Yeah it's hard to believe it really is still hard to wrap my mind around

1728
01:32:41,344 --> 01:32:41,856
Just like

1729
01:32:42,368 --> 01:32:43,648
How many different

1730
01:32:45,696 --> 01:32:46,464
Idioms

1731
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:49,792
Descriptors stories in all of this stuff about

1732
01:32:50,048 --> 01:32:50,560
Kahneman

1733
01:32:52,096 --> 01:32:52,608
Litter

1734
01:32:52,864 --> 01:32:53,376
Throughout

1735
01:32:53,632 --> 01:32:56,192
Adjust American history let alone

1736
01:32:56,448 --> 01:32:56,960
The world history

1737
01:32:57,728 --> 01:33:00,032
And yet it is still impossible to convince

1738
01:33:00,288 --> 01:33:02,336
A significant portion of people that comment

1739
01:33:03,104 --> 01:33:04,128
Yeah you know like

1740
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:07,200
Common are so good at convincing you everybody else

1741
01:33:07,456 --> 01:33:08,736
Just trying to con you yeah

1742
01:33:08,992 --> 01:33:09,504
That's

1743
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:14,880
You wind up by other artists

1744
01:33:15,136 --> 01:33:18,464
Talking

1745
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:19,744
Experiences like

1746
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,280
Episode

1747
01:33:21,792 --> 01:33:23,072
Sort of umbrella

1748
01:33:23,328 --> 01:33:24,096
My distaste

1749
01:33:24,352 --> 01:33:25,888
There's so much of it

1750
01:33:26,144 --> 01:33:27,680
Before was like what you were talking about

1751
01:33:27,936 --> 01:33:30,240
Exacerbate

1752
01:33:30,496 --> 01:33:33,312
Sure because I had some kind of

1753
01:33:33,568 --> 01:33:34,592
Maybe naive

1754
01:33:34,848 --> 01:33:36,640
Belief that what they were selling was

1755
01:33:37,152 --> 01:33:38,944
Good you would think

1756
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:39,712
Talking

1757
01:33:39,968 --> 01:33:40,480
Plaint

1758
01:33:42,272 --> 01:33:43,552
And it's not just complain

1759
01:33:43,808 --> 01:33:44,832
Pictures

1760
01:33:49,952 --> 01:33:50,464
I just

1761
01:33:51,232 --> 01:33:54,560
They just had such another layer to it

1762
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:56,352
I feel

1763
01:33:56,864 --> 01:33:57,376
So bad

1764
01:33:57,632 --> 01:33:58,400
I mean

1765
01:33:58,656 --> 01:33:59,168
Yeah

1766
01:33:59,424 --> 01:34:00,192
Not least of which

1767
01:34:00,448 --> 01:34:00,960
Because

1768
01:34:01,216 --> 01:34:02,240
Just as if you want it

1769
01:34:02,496 --> 01:34:05,056
Let's call it market capitalism

1770
01:34:05,312 --> 01:34:06,336
The market will do the

1771
01:34:09,664 --> 01:34:10,176
2

1772
01:34:10,432 --> 01:34:10,944
Sell good

1773
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:11,968
Storable food

1774
01:34:13,248 --> 01:34:17,600
Like what incentive is there in 25 years

1775
01:34:18,624 --> 01:34:21,440
You're not going to be a bit most businesses are any business 25 years

1776
01:34:21,696 --> 01:34:23,744
Business

1777
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,024
Bottom line is

1778
01:34:25,536 --> 01:34:27,328
There won't even be

1779
01:34:29,376 --> 01:34:30,400
You're going to need our food

1780
01:34:31,168 --> 01:34:32,192
Yeah

1781
01:34:32,704 --> 01:34:33,728
We won't exist

1782
01:34:36,544 --> 01:34:39,872
It's it's honestly something that I think that it might be a space

1783
01:34:42,944 --> 01:34:46,272
First I think it may call for greater regulation than even just like

1784
01:34:46,528 --> 01:34:48,064
Regular food market

1785
01:34:48,832 --> 01:34:49,600
Because of those

1786
01:34:49,856 --> 01:34:54,208
Absolutely cuz of the sort of liability that you

1787
01:34:54,464 --> 01:34:56,768
Get yourself out of based on the nature of the business

1788
01:34:57,792 --> 01:34:58,560
And of course

1789
01:34:59,584 --> 01:35:00,096
Some

1790
01:35:00,352 --> 01:35:01,376
Politician August

1791
01:35:01,888 --> 01:35:02,656
Be someone on the left

1792
01:35:02,912 --> 01:35:09,056
To suggest

1793
01:35:09,568 --> 01:35:13,664
Right

1794
01:35:14,176 --> 01:35:16,736
Is really f***** up it is really I just

1795
01:35:16,992 --> 01:35:21,600
I didn't really consider it.

1796
01:35:21,856 --> 01:35:23,648
By the time you use my product

1797
01:35:24,928 --> 01:35:25,696
I will be out of

1798
01:35:36,192 --> 01:35:37,472
Dead

1799
01:35:37,728 --> 01:35:38,496
Wow

1800
01:35:42,336 --> 01:35:44,128
Consider these things

1801
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:46,944
Just

1802
01:35:47,968 --> 01:35:48,992
Naive

1803
01:35:49,248 --> 01:35:49,760
That like

1804
01:35:50,016 --> 01:35:55,904
Sarah business

1805
01:35:56,160 --> 01:36:00,256
Bright

1806
01:36:00,512 --> 01:36:03,584
Before

1807
01:36:08,704 --> 01:36:11,264
CIA

1808
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:12,800
Has anybody figured that out yet

1809
01:36:13,568 --> 01:36:14,080
I don't know

1810
01:36:15,104 --> 01:36:16,896
Anyway Alex is like

1811
01:36:18,432 --> 01:36:19,456
This guy Steve Shank

1812
01:36:19,712 --> 01:36:23,040
Easier when he runs my truck and survival food

1813
01:36:23,808 --> 01:36:27,136
Plug

1814
01:36:27,392 --> 01:36:29,696
Food out of here to a head

1815
01:36:29,952 --> 01:36:32,768
Just so he can give you good food at the lowest price

1816
01:36:33,024 --> 01:36:34,304
Weather

1817
01:36:36,096 --> 01:36:36,608
Literally

1818
01:36:36,864 --> 01:36:37,888
Chamonix running on here

1819
01:36:38,144 --> 01:36:39,936
Not talking about Seafood direct.com

1820
01:36:40,448 --> 01:36:41,728
Does not talk about that

1821
01:36:43,776 --> 01:36:45,056
Interesting premise

1822
01:36:45,568 --> 01:36:47,104
Easier to talk about the news

1823
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:49,408
He's not here

1824
01:36:50,432 --> 01:36:53,760
It might be interesting to see what kind of news he wants me to cover

1825
01:36:54,272 --> 01:36:54,784
What he brought

1826
01:36:55,808 --> 01:36:56,320
Warriors

1827
01:37:01,696 --> 01:37:03,232
Hyperinflation

1828
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,792
Food-stamp use climbs to record

1829
01:37:08,352 --> 01:37:10,400

All about

Stories that are designed to make people more inclined

1833
01:37:18,336 --> 01:37:19,616
To buy your survival

1834
01:37:20,128 --> 01:37:22,688
How is that

1835
01:37:22,944 --> 01:37:24,736
He's just there to talk about the news

1836
01:37:24,992 --> 01:37:30,112
Please talk about bulshit

1837
01:37:33,184 --> 01:37:34,464
Presentation of life

1838
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:39,072
Call Steve

1839
01:37:39,328 --> 01:37:41,120

Direct.com

1841
01:37:46,496 --> 01:37:47,520
Adorable Foods

1842
01:37:49,056 --> 01:37:53,408
They're laughing about that concept

1843
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:55,968
He's told me that

1844
01:37:56,224 --> 01:37:56,736
It's so good

1845
01:37:56,992 --> 01:37:58,784
F*** you. f*** you

1846
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:04,416
You know what you think

1847
01:38:04,672 --> 01:38:05,696
I can just imagine that

1848
01:38:05,952 --> 01:38:09,792
Somebody who's listening to this show in 2012 bought that food

1849
01:38:10,304 --> 01:38:12,352
And then they were the people complaining

1850
01:38:12,608 --> 01:38:13,120
On the web

1851
01:38:13,632 --> 01:38:14,144
But I

1852
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:14,912
6 months ago

1853
01:38:16,192 --> 01:38:16,960
They opened it up

1854
01:38:17,472 --> 01:38:18,496
Then we got the food

1855
01:38:18,752 --> 01:38:20,288
It's a good thing everybody

1856
01:38:20,544 --> 01:38:21,824
You know that was when the markets

1857
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:23,872
The shelves were all empty

1858
01:38:24,128 --> 01:38:26,944
Target had no toilet paper down the way

1859
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:27,968
And they're like f***

1860
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:30,784
We're going to open up the store but food and then they get

1861
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:37,184
Even if it's just a thing where things are looking

1862
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:40,768
By this food out and see what we've got

1863
01:38:41,536 --> 01:38:44,608
Like I can't draw

1864
01:38:44,864 --> 01:38:48,448
A direct line

1865
01:38:48,704 --> 01:38:49,216
2

1866
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:51,008
Think of it

1867
01:38:52,544 --> 01:38:55,104
Because of this disgraceful display

1868
01:38:56,384 --> 01:38:56,896
Maybe

1869
01:38:59,200 --> 01:38:59,712
No-Man

1870
01:39:00,224 --> 01:39:00,992
Bummer is

1871
01:39:05,088 --> 01:39:07,648
Go f*** yourself with this this isn't an infomercial

1872
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:09,440
You can't do anything about

1873
01:39:10,208 --> 01:39:13,792
The earthquakes in the storms and things are happening as a result of it

1874
01:39:14,304 --> 01:39:15,072
The 2012-13

1875
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:17,376
Do anything about what's going to happen

1876
01:39:24,288 --> 01:39:27,360
Apocalypse

1877
01:39:30,176 --> 01:39:31,200
Now with this election

1878
01:39:31,456 --> 01:39:32,224
It doesn't matter

1879
01:39:32,992 --> 01:39:35,296
Neither one said anything about

1880
01:39:36,064 --> 01:39:37,600
Individual

1881
01:39:37,856 --> 01:39:38,880
Back it out there can't do any

1882
01:39:39,136 --> 01:39:39,648
Anything about

1883
01:39:39,904 --> 01:39:40,416
What's going to happen

1884
01:39:40,928 --> 01:39:44,256
With all of the goofiness is going on with government to take over the food and

1885
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:47,328
That we're going to talk about Michelle Obama and and her

1886
01:39:47,584 --> 01:39:48,352
Interested in

1887
01:39:50,144 --> 01:39:52,960
Later

1888
01:39:53,728 --> 01:39:55,008
So anyway

1889
01:39:55,264 --> 01:39:56,800
You can't do anything about that

1890
01:39:57,824 --> 01:39:58,336
Alex

1891
01:39:58,592 --> 01:39:59,360
You are a

1892
01:40:00,128 --> 01:40:00,640
Master

1893
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:06,528
In and finding all the goofy stuff is going on all the inappropriate stuff

1894
01:40:12,416 --> 01:40:13,184
Actually take notes

1895
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:14,976
Can you bring up what's going on with app

1896
01:40:15,232 --> 01:40:17,024
What you when you bring up what's going on

1897
01:40:17,536 --> 01:40:20,096
What's the Chinese taking over our Farmland when you bring up

1898
01:40:20,352 --> 01:40:22,912
What's going on with ethanol on the various things that we talked about

1899
01:40:24,448 --> 01:40:25,472
But I got a question for you

1900
01:40:25,728 --> 01:40:27,008
You got food in your

1901
01:40:27,264 --> 01:40:28,288
In your garage

1902
01:40:29,312 --> 01:40:29,824
Air conditioning

1903
01:40:30,592 --> 01:40:31,616
What can you do about

1904
01:40:31,872 --> 01:40:32,384
Obama

1905
01:40:32,896 --> 01:40:34,176
And the

1906
01:40:34,688 --> 01:40:35,712
And what can you do about

1907
01:40:35,968 --> 01:40:36,992
All of the things that we talked

1908
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:40,832
And all these people

1909
01:40:41,344 --> 01:40:42,112
And are saying

1910
01:40:42,368 --> 01:40:44,160
My gosh Alex really hit it today

1911
01:40:52,864 --> 01:40:53,888
The food is alive

1912
01:40:55,680 --> 01:40:56,448
No I agree

1913
01:41:00,544 --> 01:41:01,568
Charity levels

1914
01:41:04,128 --> 01:41:07,456
Wow

1915
01:41:07,712 --> 01:41:13,856
There's nothing they can do

1916
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:16,160
Terms that is a call to action

1917
01:41:16,416 --> 01:41:22,560
Ya-hey

1918
01:41:24,864 --> 01:41:26,144
I can't imagine

1919
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:27,936
A better way to stop

1920
01:41:28,448 --> 01:41:28,960
Listening to

1921
01:41:29,216 --> 01:41:31,776
Infowars somebody was like

1922
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:34,080
Here here's what you do

1923
01:41:34,592 --> 01:41:35,104
Take note

1924
01:41:35,872 --> 01:41:37,664
Everyday

1925
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:43,040
It's kind of like if you don't take notes

1926
01:41:43,296 --> 01:41:46,112
What's on a weekly basis

1927
01:41:46,368 --> 01:41:47,136
For one week

1928
01:41:47,392 --> 01:41:49,696
Take notes of what he says day-to-day today

1929
01:41:49,952 --> 01:41:50,976
And then compare them

1930
01:41:51,488 --> 01:41:52,256
From just what

1931
01:41:52,512 --> 01:41:53,280
He says in one week

1932
01:41:53,536 --> 01:41:54,304
You will find at least

1933
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:56,352
30 different things that he's on both sides

1934
01:41:56,864 --> 01:41:57,888
I don't know

1935
01:41:58,144 --> 01:41:59,680
If you choose the right week

1936
01:41:59,936 --> 01:42:02,240
You're probably right

1937
01:42:02,496 --> 01:42:08,128
Stray too far off and pass

1938
01:42:08,896 --> 01:42:09,408
None of it

1939
01:42:10,688 --> 01:42:13,760
You just take notes over a day and track down like

1940
01:42:14,272 --> 01:42:15,808
The things that you say

1941
01:42:18,624 --> 01:42:20,416
Mind actually looks

1942
01:42:20,672 --> 01:42:21,184
4

1943
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:22,464
Information

1944
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:24,256
You could not possibly

1945
01:42:24,512 --> 01:42:25,024
Continually

1946
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:26,560
Absolutely

1947
01:42:26,816 --> 01:42:29,120
The only reason you would ever

1948
01:42:29,632 --> 01:42:30,656
Maintain

1949
01:42:30,912 --> 01:42:32,704
Begin Infowars listener

1950
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:41,152
Just sort of unquestioning

1951
01:42:41,664 --> 01:42:42,432
If they're not questioning

1952
01:42:42,944 --> 01:42:43,456
What they're here

1953
01:42:43,968 --> 01:42:45,248
Because it's easy.

1954
01:42:45,504 --> 01:42:46,016
Captured

1955
01:42:46,272 --> 01:42:48,832
Patterns of accepting

1956
01:42:51,392 --> 01:42:52,160
Is reputable

1957
01:42:52,416 --> 01:42:55,744
There were listeners

1958
01:42:56,768 --> 01:42:58,048
Obviously

1959
01:43:03,424 --> 01:43:07,008
Just sort of a compulsive exercise

1960
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:08,032
Score

1961
01:43:08,544 --> 01:43:09,568
So Alex

1962
01:43:14,432 --> 01:43:14,944
Your food

1963
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:17,504
Alex says he does

1964
01:43:20,832 --> 01:43:21,344
Everything

1965
01:43:23,136 --> 01:43:24,928
I am so on please we were proven right

1966
01:43:25,184 --> 01:43:25,952
But I agree with you

1967
01:43:26,464 --> 01:43:30,304
People need to have good friends and family and medical supplies and food

1968
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:32,096
Water filtration in firearms

1969
01:43:32,864 --> 01:43:35,424
And I've gotten out of the question I lived in town

1970
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:37,216
I like living in town I like a drive

1971
01:43:37,728 --> 01:43:39,008
About quarter mile the movie theater

1972
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:41,312
Grocery store not now

1973
01:43:41,824 --> 01:43:43,360
I got to drive 10 minutes to get anywhere

1974
01:43:45,408 --> 01:43:47,456
I went and registered agent relocation

1975
01:43:47,968 --> 01:43:51,552
I found the one area in the Hill Country in Texas is by what a few save areas

1976
01:43:56,416 --> 01:43:56,928
Because

1977
01:43:57,184 --> 01:43:57,952
This is real

1978
01:43:58,464 --> 01:44:01,792
Dial people will go to the one place to get their food

1979
01:44:04,864 --> 01:44:05,888
Efoodsdirect.com

1980
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:07,680
Embarrassing

1981
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:15,104
Flash Forward 8 years Alex

1982
01:44:15,616 --> 01:44:16,384
You lying piece

1983
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:22,272
The ship

1984
01:44:22,528 --> 01:44:27,136
8 years later it's still real right now that I'm going to go stock food up

1985
01:44:27,392 --> 01:44:29,184
Country Inn

1986
01:44:29,696 --> 01:44:33,536
Is George Foreman actually had one

1987
01:44:33,792 --> 01:44:35,328
Cooking grill

1988

Performing

1989
01:44:39,424 --> 01:44:42,752
The severity of the situation requires YouTube

1990
01:44:43,008 --> 01:44:43,776
The product solute

1991
01:44:44,032 --> 01:44:45,568
It's just gross

1992
01:44:45,824 --> 01:44:50,432
That's not good grocer for me because this touches on like

1993
01:44:50,688 --> 01:44:51,968
A lot of my

1994
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:52,992
Belief

01:44:59,648 --> 01:45:00,928
And I really

1997
01:45:01,184 --> 01:45:01,696
I

1998
01:45:02,720 --> 01:45:06,048
Cuz you don't just need food for your self you need it for your family in your neighbors

1999
01:45:06,816 --> 01:45:07,840
Flash Forward to 2020

2000
01:45:08,608 --> 01:45:09,376
Superpowers being honest

2001
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:13,728

2004
01:45:24,224 --> 01:45:27,808
The reason that I'm personally offended

2005
01:45:28,832 --> 01:45:29,856
Any kind of

2006
01:45:30,112 --> 01:45:31,136
Perspective

2007
01:45:31,392 --> 01:45:31,904

2009
01:45:32,928 --> 01:45:35,488
Things going bad

2010
01:45:35,744 --> 01:45:37,792
Should take into consideration the people around

2011
01:45:38,048 --> 01:45:40,352
You should never be looking at

2012
01:45:41,376 --> 01:45:44,192
Are like getting a weapon to protect yourself from your neighbors

2013
01:45:44,704 --> 01:45:45,984
Think about getting a weapon

2014
01:45:46,240 --> 01:45:47,264
Possibly to help

2015
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:48,288

Community-minded

2018
01:45:52,384 --> 01:45:53,408
Approaches

2019
01:45:53,664 --> 01:45:54,176
Towards

2020
01:45:54,688 --> 01:45:56,480
Anything that could go bad

2021
01:45:56,736 --> 01:45:57,248
So much

2022
01:45:57,504 --> 01:45:58,016
More help

2023
01:45:58,272 --> 01:45:58,784
Full

2024
01:45:59,040 --> 01:45:59,808
Then

2025
01:46:00,576 --> 01:46:03,904
Vuse where it's like I'm the only Survivor

2026
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:04,672
You know

2027
01:46:04,928 --> 01:46:05,696
MMA

2028
01:46:06,208 --> 01:46:07,232
Alex knows that

2029
01:46:08,512 --> 01:46:13,632
2012 you sitting here saying you need food for your neighbors and yeah

2030
01:46:13,888 --> 01:46:14,656
A bucket

2031
01:46:14,912 --> 01:46:15,936
It's great because then you can

2032
01:46:16,192 --> 01:46:17,472
Can help your neighbor survive

2033
01:46:17,728 --> 01:46:20,800
Yep that is something really awesome if you're able to afford that are

2034
01:46:21,056 --> 01:46:22,848
In such a position where you can do that

2035
01:46:23,104 --> 01:46:24,128
That's great

2036
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:25,920
Alex

2037
01:46:26,176 --> 01:46:26,944
But he doesn't mean it

2038
01:46:27,456 --> 01:46:28,224
He doesn't mean it

2039
01:46:30,784 --> 01:46:31,296
Furthermore

2040
01:46:31,552 --> 01:46:32,064
Just

2041
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:32,832
Strictly

2042
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:35,392
Cooperation has not been like

2043
01:46:35,904 --> 01:46:40,000
One of the strategies to survive and has been the only successful strategy

2044
01:46:40,512 --> 01:46:41,536
It's the best why we're still

2045
01:46:41,792 --> 01:46:44,352
It's the best adaptive strategies

2046
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:49,216
And finding people around you to create a Cooperative Community with

2047
01:46:49,472 --> 01:46:50,496
Will make you far worse

2048
01:46:50,752 --> 01:46:52,544
Successful

2049
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:53,312
With a f******

2050
01:46:53,568 --> 01:46:54,336
Gun

2051
01:46:54,592 --> 01:46:55,872
Basically holding your family

2052
01:46:56,128 --> 01:46:58,944
Mashed potatoes

2053
01:46:59,200 --> 01:47:04,064
Like what are you guys doing this gun to protect this bad food that I overpaid for

2054
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:05,088
Amanda

2055
01:47:05,344 --> 01:47:07,904
It's a real bummer because

2056
01:47:08,160 --> 01:47:09,184
It's a

2057
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:09,952
Like app

2058
01:47:10,208 --> 01:47:11,744
A presentation of

2059
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:13,024
Something good

2060
01:47:13,536 --> 01:47:15,328
Bean used in service of everything

2061
01:47:20,704 --> 01:47:23,520
I mean it's kind of like

2062
01:47:23,776 --> 01:47:24,800
Too much by

2063
01:47:25,824 --> 01:47:27,616
Media and culture in

2064
01:47:28,384 --> 01:47:29,152
All that stuff

2065
01:47:29,408 --> 01:47:31,968
Then you you're steady drumbeat of dis

2066
01:47:32,224 --> 01:47:33,248
Dystopias are always

2067
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:34,528
You know it's the person

2068
01:47:34,784 --> 01:47:35,296
Surviving

2069
01:47:35,552 --> 01:47:37,600
Dystopia

2070
01:47:38,112 --> 01:47:44,256
Community and we're going to get all this stuff together and we're going to do a little bit just to Spectrum

2071
01:47:47,328 --> 01:47:48,352
Yeah

2072
01:47:51,680 --> 01:47:53,472
The Marquis

2073
01:47:54,240 --> 01:47:56,800
I think it's your Story 2

2074
01:47:57,056 --> 01:47:58,080
To tell

2075
01:48:04,992 --> 01:48:06,784
F*** all this s***

2076
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:08,320
I hate him so much

2077
01:48:08,576 --> 01:48:09,856
Hated so much

2078
01:48:10,112 --> 01:48:15,232
So interesting 2012 exact same behavior

2079
01:48:15,488 --> 01:48:17,280
Kind of even grosser because of

2080
01:48:17,536 --> 01:48:19,584
Like a little wrinkles

2081
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:21,632
French food sponsor

01:48:22,144 --> 01:48:23,936
Probably got a business effort

2083
01:48:24,192 --> 01:48:25,216
Getting tens of thousands

2084
01:48:25,472 --> 01:48:27,776
The dollars of profit

2085
01:48:28,032 --> 01:48:29,824
Gross

2086
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:33,664
Just like using Alex as a

2087
01:48:34,176 --> 01:48:34,688
Platform

2088
01:48:34,944 --> 01:48:36,480
To promote his product

2089
01:48:37,248 --> 01:48:37,760
And

2090
01:48:38,016 --> 01:48:39,296
Using of

01:48:40,832 --> 01:48:41,344

2096
01:48:53,632 --> 01:48:55,424
And by virtue of that

2097
01:48:57,728 --> 01:48:58,496
Such a weird world

2098
01:49:02,592 --> 01:49:07,712
All kinds of weird s*** happens in day today

2099
01:49:07,968 --> 01:49:10,528
Nothing makes any sense but it's all Vaguely Familiar

2100
01:49:10,784 --> 01:49:12,064

01:49:14,624 --> 01:49:16,928
Everything is everything on Infowars is uncanny

2103
01:49:17,184 --> 01:49:21,024
Like it's vaguely similar to something that you know from The Real World

2104
01:49:21,792 --> 01:49:22,304
And yet

2105
01:49:23,072 --> 01:49:23,584

2111
01:49:44,576 --> 01:49:45,600

2112
01:49:45,856 --> 01:49:46,880
Wrangle with the Devil
