1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,992
Damn important I sweat it

2
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:27,648
I have great respect for knowledge by knowledge I'm sick of them posing as you're through the good guy

3
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:40,448
Need money

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,136
Dot-com

5
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:07,840
Talk a little bit of Jordan Jordan

6
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,936
Sweet spot for today is

7
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:12,960
Aspirational

8
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:15,264
I agree it's not it doesn't exist yet

9
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,312
I haven't existed ever exist

10
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:18,336
But I intend to

11
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:22,176
Okay I realized sitting around

12
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:22,944
A little bored

13
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,736
That I have never made lasagna

14
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:26,272
You've never made lasagna

15
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:30,880
Okay but I realize that it's within my ability to do that

16
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:37,536
Is it I just need a pan

17
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:43,936
If you go to the store I can go get one of those vans

18
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:44,960
It seems like such

19
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:48,800
Pie-in-the-sky kind of thing like

20
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:51,616
The f*** out of here

21
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,224
Seems it seems like some I like lasagna quite a bit and get so delicious

22
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,344
I could never do that

23
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:05,440
I've decided I can do it so I'm planning to hit some point

24
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:10,304
Eventually that I will make a lasagna

25
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,352
To make a lasagna

26
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:14,656
Visualize making a lasagna and I think that

27
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:22,592
How about you

28
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:27,456
Missouri five years and five years in 2015 and I played it and it's

29
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:30,272
F****** incredible I saw on your Twitter account

30
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:36,672
Babe there is apparently a regional version

31
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:40,256
Was it was hinted at in the original version what they've done is they took the first

32
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:44,864
A few hours of the original game and expanded into the entire game

33
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,448
Okay there's some stuff that was hinted at

34
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:52,544
When they blew up there cuz

35
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,824
Okay

36
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:00,224
And so on and so forth literally sucking life out of the plant

37
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:08,672
Everybody who is really

38
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:12,512
The interested in video games will tell you at nausea migraine

39
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:17,632
Any of the Final Fantasy games so it seems like

40
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:18,400
Give a shot at something

41
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,216
I might not

42
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,752
Movie after this lasagna

43
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:24,544
It's amazing just because

44
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:28,128
Everything was in Elder backgrounds were in 2D

45
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,408
And so

46
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:31,456
Now you're going through and you're actually walking

47
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,272
Through as if you're walking into

48
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:37,088
One of these in alike woolmarket

49
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:38,368

Perving on women essentially sure

54

55
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:52,448
The game is Sage

56
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,216

Chris Smith

100
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:33,471
So I want to say I also I would apologize

101
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,519
He's about the last a week

102
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:36,799
Somebody episodes

103
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:38,335
I could feel myself not

104
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,103
Not caring

105
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,895
I could feel myself

106
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:44,991
And you know what I sat with those feelings I reflected on what was going on

107
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:47,295
And I think huge part of it is

108
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,343
I was starting to get mad at Alex

109
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:51,135
I was really starting to get pissed

110
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:54,207
Because a lot of his stuff is really boring b*******

111
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,743
The stakes are pretty high

112
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:58,815
And stuff to watch him manipulate people in

113
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:01,631
Nike for the reasons that he's doing it in

114
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:05,215
In real-time like wow there is it an actual

115
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:09,055
Event in the world happening

116
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:11,359
It's not it's not abstract

117
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:14,175
Acts in the way it's so many of his lies often are

118
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:16,991
I'm it's very real and

119
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,015
It's a bummer

120
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:18,783
It's not fun

121
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,319
And then on top of that

122
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,599
Everything is a disappointing

123
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:24,927
He gets a DUI and he just lies about it

124
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,463
He gets a letter from the New York

125
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:28,767
Attorney general but I give him a cease-and-desist

126
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:29,791
He just lies about it

127
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:32,351
He gets a letter from the FDA

128
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:35,679
Just the other at the end of last week and observe just lies.

129
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,471
Everything is just like

130
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:40,287
He says he's going to reveal qanon

131
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,079
Doesn't do it for

132
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:47,711
It just there's no payoff to anything and I was just getting to a point where I was actually mad at him

133
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:51,039
Doesn't really work it's not really fun when I'm mad

134
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,599
It doesn't

135
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:58,207
It's just out of balance it's it's a Cortana Scottsdale

136
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,231
Has to be mad at him

137
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:00,255
And I have been

138
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:02,303
Pretty much since we started this

139
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:04,095
Almost

140
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,119
The first

141
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,911
That's

142
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:08,959
Good

143
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:16,383
My job is to take them

144
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,919
Distance

145
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:21,503
Of course of course I'm mad at you for stealing my job

146
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:27,391
This is this is the way of boss and I don't know I don't know exactly why that was happening

147
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:30,207
And you know we could talk all day about

148
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,743
Now what's going on but

149
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,279
I decided that you know what

150
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:37,887
I got to put Alex in timeout if I can't be around each other

151
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,447
For a bit we got if you just got to see

152
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:43,007
What happens when

153
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:45,055
And are you seeing

154
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,079
In the real world

155
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,359
That

156
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:48,639
Deplatforming

157
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,943
Has a certain amount of effective

158
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:53,503
Hypnotists are when you're mad at a propagandist

159
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,039
Document your platform

160
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:58,879
Deplatform Alex former show today

161
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:01,695
And I will be doing something entirely different

162
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:04,255
Hi everyone I'm Kerry Cassidy

163
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:07,071
From Project Camelot

164
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,095
8 today

165
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:11,679
To go over some of the things that are going down around us

166
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:12,959
And talk about

167
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,239
What's really happen

168
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:21,151
So today we are going over to videos that Carey put out last night

169
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,687
Camelot has some news

170
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,991
Coronavirus

171
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:30,367
So there's a couple things that I want to highlight

172
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:32,415
Some of these theories

173
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,975
Are pretty out there okay alright

174
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:35,743
2

175
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:40,351
A lot of the stuff that you believe is exactly what Alex believe course

176
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:44,703
So I want I want those two things to mingle in your mind

177
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,287
And I want you to recognize that the theories that Alex.

178
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:50,335
That's about right at home on

179
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,615
On Project Camelot

180
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:55,967
And the sort of discourse that he brings into the world deserves as much respect

181
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:56,991
Assembly

182
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,783
Wacky nonsense

183
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,551
Licari's

184
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:06,719
Explain to me how inter-dimensional space beings who are evil controlling things that also

185
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:09,791
Literal Satan is real and that's how we're dying everyday

186
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:12,863
Seems to belong on Project Camelot

187
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:17,215
That is what she says and it's also what else says

188
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:22,079
Exactly

189
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:22,847
The first report

190
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:24,127
The distance from the set-up

191
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:29,247
Was last Tuesday I think it was Tuesday and Wednesday

192
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,015
The first one

193
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:37,439
What are the things that's great about Carrie is that she

194
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:39,487
Has no

195
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:40,511
Sort of

196
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:41,535
Cabello's

197
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,303
About

198
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,839
Admitting that

199
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:44,607
Feed

200
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,887
Has terrible sources

201
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,191
They're great sources

202
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:50,495
But she'll say who these people are

203
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:53,055
And and then you can be like

204
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:59,455
Lieutenant Colonel told me that

205
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:01,247
His bulshit sources whereas

206
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,271
Carrie is

207
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:05,087
Out and proud about she's imagining

208
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,951
Beginning of this before we eat here

209
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:11,231
The carry

210
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:15,327
I know somebody who's basically figured out a cure for the world

211
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,399
SS credible

212
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,447
I just dinner interview

213
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,215
Andrea

214
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:22,495
Kalker who has

215
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:24,543
Basically care for the world

216
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:25,567
So

217
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:27,103
It's similar.

218
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:29,151
Trying to put out there which is an old

219
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,943
Cure for malaria

220
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,503
But as Andreas

221
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,271
Explain

222
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:35,551
It contains

223
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,087
Chlorine

224
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,367
As one of its main

225
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:41,695
Can I show the ingredients

226
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,255
I know case it has tonic water

227
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,279
Oh

228
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,047
For the heart

229
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:48,351
So this remedy that

230
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:49,375
Andrea Scott

231
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,655
Call Curtis talking about

232
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,703
Is actually

233
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,471
Water

234
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,751
And chlorine

235
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,287
As I understand it

236
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,823
Standing a certain way

237
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,615
And you can go to with his web

238
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:01,151
Website which is Andreas

239
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,175
Soccer.com

240
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:07,295
Take a note

241
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:11,903
Bleach as a Publix

242
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:12,927
Pool

243
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,207
And drink up

244
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,487
And then we'll all be safe

245
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,535
Kalker is knotted

246
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:20,351
He has a degree supposedly titled quoted

247
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:23,679
Doctor of philosophy and alternative medicine and natural

248
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:26,751
Charlie from a real University

249
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:31,103
It's from the open University of advanced Incorporated

250
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:37,503
Security Incorporated Incorporated

251
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:41,087
Corporate Incorporated site in the name

252
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,367
Anyway that's not a good

253
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,135
Good sign

254
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:47,231
I checked out their website is anything other than diploma Mill

255
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:47,999
Which makes sense

256
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:50,047
Project Camelot associate

257
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:56,191
Andreas kalcker is a big anti-vax guy who got his book pulled from Amazon last year in their sweep of

258
00:12:56,447 --> 00:13:00,287
Kicking off books that Advocate drinking bleach to quote-unquote cure autism

259
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:04,127
You the real unreliable and dangerous source of health information but

260
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,663
He's able to pretend that he speaking

261
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,967
From a place of authority and expertise because of his

262
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:09,247
Doctorate degree

263
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,295
Which makes it funny

264
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:16,927
The landing page for the open University in advanced studies Incorporated is not about their wonderful Edge

265
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:19,487
Educational programs about the history of the school

266
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:20,767
What's a disclaimer

267
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,047
It starts quote

268
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:28,447
Open University of advanced sciences clarifies that it does not maintain any type of link with each genesis2church

269
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:31,007
Or does it advocate be medical or therapeutic

270
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,287
MMS

271
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:37,407
MMS is the Miracle Mineral Solution which is just be fun brand name for a bleach

272
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:41,247
Product these dumb dumb self

273
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:44,319
The genesis2church is run by Jim Humble

274
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,599
The guy who invented

275
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,367
MMS

276
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:48,415
A project

277
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:53,535
If I understand the situation correctly he knows that it's illegal to advise people to drink bleach

278
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:59,935
But he can plead religious intolerance if you makes drinking bleach part of the sacrament of his made up Church

279
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:04,031
Along with Alex Jones the genesis2church were among the recipients of the letters

280
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,823
From the FDA the end of last week

281
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,383
About their coronavirus scam

282
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:13,759
You know if you have to have a disclaimer write-up

283
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,807
The gate that says to me that it's

284
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:16,575
The opposite

285
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:17,343
It's true

286
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:19,135
On your college

287
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,415
Well it's because

288
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:23,743
Andreas kalcker is one of the main people who like

289
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,279
Uses his degree from this

290
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,815
Play saz

291
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:30,399
Of course they're associated with him by virtue of like

292
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,423
We told him the f******

293
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:37,823
You know when you wanted to scam people

294
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,615
You had to fake your own degree

295
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,151
Glad to have some graphics

296
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:43,199
Designware take

297
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:46,271
Classic calligraphy

298
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:49,855
It scrapes off seals and put them back on

299
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:50,879
Natsu

300
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:54,463
Pipe it up and Xerox it that's a bummer

301
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:57,791
But looked so anyway

302
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:58,559
I guess

303
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:00,607
Sure

304
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:03,679
It's not good

305
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,471
It's a bad thing. Oh it is a bad idea

306
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:09,567
Carrie's done it and it's great I'll know

307
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:12,639
It is curing doctors in Spain and

308
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,431
I've used it myself

309
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,967
Myself and my ex

310
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:18,783
Text partner Bill Ryan and I came back from Russia

311
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,319
Had a virus

312
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:22,367
Back in those days this is over

313
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:23,903
Can yours ago

314
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:24,927
Maybe

315
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,975
Around 12 years ago

316
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:29,279
And we interviewed boriska

317
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:31,327
The boy from Mars as he's called

318
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,351
Came back

319
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,471
Rid of for 2 weeks

320
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:38,495
We took

321
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:39,519
Finally took

322
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:41,567
MMS someone told us about it

323
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,615
The gym humble was marketing

324
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:44,639
The time

325
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:45,663
And

326
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,455
It cured Us in two days

327
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:48,735
So

328
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:52,831
That is an indication that this flu like

329
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,367
Situation

330
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:57,183
I can definitely be handled by

331
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,463
This new

332
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:00,511
Version of MMS witches

333
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:01,279
But Andreas

334
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,303
Conquerors talking about

335
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:04,095
I got to say case closed

336
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:06,399
I mean I think the science is in

337
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:09,727
Dare you believe him when he says he has a new version

338
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:10,751
Dare you

339
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:11,775
Slightly mixed

340
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:13,055
Differently

341
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,079
F****** thing

342
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:16,383
I am certain it's almost exactly

343
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,991
Brutal about there's a strain of science denial that goes through this

344
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:27,391
I might not have decided to do this episode episode about something else for today while Alex

345
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:30,463
Is that for me

346
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,023
There is

347
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,047
Veal

348
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:36,351
Some beliefs that Carrie has

349
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:38,143
Shocking

350
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,423
In there like

351
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,215
Level

352
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:42,495
Reality tonight

353
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:45,311
Okay talking about someone who believes the rappers come to Earth

354
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:49,919
Level

355
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,967
Denial of reality

356
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:56,319
A lot of it does sort of circle around the

357
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:59,391
Told you call it

358
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:01,183
The medicine medical aspect

359
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,719
Of the Coronavirus

360
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,535
Salina

361
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,071
Bleach

362
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:07,839
Is better than better

363
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:10,399
He's been doing some tasks

364
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,423
And the doc

365
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,191
Doctors are all

366
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,215
Coming in

367
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:15,263
Healed after two days of taking it

368
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,311
Take your chances

369
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,335
If you want to

370
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,615
Do not take your chances

371
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:20,639
Conventional

372
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:21,919
Madison

373
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:22,943
Then go ahead

374
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:26,271
But the bottom line is that this is actually

375
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:28,575
Quite possibly going to cure the world

376
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:34,463
Drinking bleach water is going to

377
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,487
You know it's

378
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:37,791
It's so hard not to have a brief moment

379
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:41,119
Because she says it's so confidently I do have a brief moment of what

380
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:48,799
Maybe please would help I don't know and then immediately like why does that happen she says

381
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:55,199
Chance with conventional medicine and probably die or drink bleach water

382
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:58,783
And Liz straight

383
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,367
You know you got that choice in front of you which using

384
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,647
False

385
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:04,671
But Carrie wants

386
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:11,071
Trump to make the right decision

387
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,863
Trump to drink MMS

388
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:14,399
Stuff that is

389
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:15,935
Absolutely unheard of

390
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:17,215
That's not what she's saying

391
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,799
But this needs to become like government policy

392
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:25,919
There are solutions to the problems we have all you have to do is listen to

393
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:26,687
The people

394
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:27,711
As opposed to

395
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,479
To the so-called

396
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,271
Experts out there

397
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:35,903
So if our president will get wise and do the same thing then we will

398
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,695
Get out of the situation wherein

399
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:38,719
Very quickly

400
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:42,303
Trump just needs to listen to the bleach people

401
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,143
F*** would you listen to the people who haven't spent their entire life

402
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:48,959
Studying epidemiology

403
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:52,543
Listen to the baseball the bleach cream

404
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,615
I will listen to the people when they're like we're serving

405
00:18:55,871 --> 00:19:02,015
But I'm not going to listen to the people when I've got an epidemiologist over here is like I need to do and then the people are like Drake

406
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,551
The people

407
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:04,575
Are good

408
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:09,183
But not epidemiology bleach people that bleach people are not

409
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:12,767
Which people will say

410
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:18,399
Just drink cyanide

411
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:19,679
Whatever you want

412
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:20,959
Believe it

413
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:23,007
I can't take a flipping

414
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:24,031
Approached

415
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:25,567
Because like she has

416
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:26,591
People

417
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:28,127
Cioppino

418
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:28,895
It's not

419
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:31,967
It's not just advice that exist in a vacuum

420
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:34,015
People are being told this

421
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,295
Play someone who pretends

422
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:37,855
You know what they're talkin about

423
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:42,463
That's so scary there cuz there's a part of me that just wants to be like

424
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,743
Hey we got to have

425
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:45,535
At some point in time you have to have per

426
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:48,095
Purcellville agency and if you drink bleach

427
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,679
On you you are the person who decided to drink

428
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:55,007
I also think the person who told you to drink

429
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,287
Bleach is evil is

430
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,823
I don't think that those are

431
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:00,639
His room

432
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:02,175
For responsibilities in Mexico

433
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,199
Corners

434
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,247
Alex doesn't

435
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,783
People drink bleach

436
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:09,087
Although he does

437
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:11,647
Drift into unproven

438
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:14,463
Medical stuff

439
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,999
Especially as it relates to this

440
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,559
Between the Hydrox

441
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:20,607
Chloroquine pushing like crazy

442
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:21,887
The

443
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:24,447
The new one diaper Ivermectin

444
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,983
Horsepaste

445
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:26,751
Just plain old

446
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:32,639
Yeah sort of similarity and difference there

447
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:36,223
I think in this next clip you really see like

448
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:37,503
Complete

449
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:38,271
Overlap

450
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:40,575
Now needless to say they're doing it on

451
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:41,599
Purpose

452
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:47,487
The virus out there talking about how big Pharma will benefit from vaccinating everyone

453
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:50,047
Getting your DNA at the same time

454
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,327
And shooting you

455
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,631
Up with what is an essence

456
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:58,239
Nanodots that will track you and everything you do from then on

457
00:20:59,007 --> 00:20:59,775
For the rest of your life

458
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:00,799
Nanodots

459
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:01,823
And also hook you up

460
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:03,359
25g and

461
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:04,383
Vai

462
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,919
The planetary AI

463
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,711
The board will I get better service

464
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:08,735
The hivemind

465
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,271
So this is

466
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:11,295
Impart

467
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,343
May I apply

468
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,111
What that is

469
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,391
Forth by the

470
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:18,464
ETS that are backing The Darkside

471
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:20,256
The Darkside

472
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,536
April out by the way

473
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:23,328
What Trump is doing

474
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:31,264
Darth Maul

475
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:37,408
Team play

476
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:42,016
So I mean you see if you see that you just got to recognize like

477
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:45,600
These are similar

478
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:47,392
Absolutely

479
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:49,184
It's not that different

480
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:54,048
And the things that are very similar are things that relate to things that

481
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:57,120
Matter in the real world in the real world

482
00:21:57,376 --> 00:22:01,472
The huge issue is REI Cary

483
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:03,008
Really stupid s***

484
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:04,544
About nonsense

485
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:09,408
But doesn't matter coming down and killing everybody not on Alex Jones Show

486
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,200
Take this miracle drug

487
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:16,320
On Alex's show of vaccines because they're just wanted

488
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:17,344
Take your genetic

489
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,160
Material into into an AI grid

490
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:21,440
Amazon

491
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,976
Alex

492
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:24,256
Anyway

493
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:25,792
It is like nanodesu

494
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:28,608
Alex

495
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:29,376
Alex

496
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:32,448
Carrie has a i

497
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:37,568
She has a list here of like ways that you could tell

498
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,592
Trump

499
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:40,640
Is actually doing bad

500
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:43,200
I'll give you turn bad

501
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:44,224
Looking out your window

502
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,528
Is that one of the ways you can tell if he's go bad

503
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:49,088
Certain things that he could do or not

504
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:52,928
Do that would tell you if this is like a limited hangout situation

505
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:54,464
I want

506
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:56,768
Pay attention to this list because

507
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:57,792
This list is

508
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:58,816
Unattainable

509
00:22:59,328 --> 00:22:59,840
It's amazing

510
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:01,376
You're setting up

511
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,912
A list of Cirque

512
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:03,680
Circumstances

513
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:05,216
That will never Attain

514
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:06,752
Almost to none of these

515
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:08,288
He's probably will ever

516
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:12,384
That one of them has to be him saying

517
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,480
Why don't we let the virus wash Over America

518
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:19,296
That's not in there

519
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:21,344
So how will we know that Trump

520
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,160
Qanon and the military that's working with

521
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:24,928
Trump

522
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:26,720
And not all the military are

523
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:27,488
By the way

524
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:30,560
Also I should like this at I just might be

525
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:32,608
Not something we've talked about a time to

526
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:34,144
Security is pretty into qanon

527
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:39,520
She makes a little bit clearer when she's not talking to a gas leak

528
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,800
By yourself

529
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:41,824
Too pretty

530
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,592
I believe

531
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:46,176
Are are basically

532
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:50,528
It whether their plans been foiled and whether they're working at

533
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,064
As a limited Hangout

534
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,344
Or whether they're the real

535
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,624
Nothing

536
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,648
First of all

537
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:57,952
The 5G gets rolled out in the US

538
00:23:58,464 --> 00:23:59,232
And there's no

539
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,256
Fail-Safe

540
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:03,328
Protection for the people against his radiation a harmful

541
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,096
Facts

542
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,632
If that happens

543
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:11,008
Again this is number one we will know that Trump is under control of some group

544
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,544
And that group is negative

545
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:14,336
Number two.

546
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:15,104
Vaccines

547
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,408
Become mend mandatory for travel

548
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,688
And in general

549
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:23,552
Number 3 with the rollout of the new Financial system people find

550
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:25,344
That their money is worthless

551
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:28,672
Inflation is a sign for

552
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:31,488
There is no visible dent

553
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:34,048
In child trafficking and pedophilia

554
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:39,936
There is no sign of the arrests or trials for those

555
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:40,704
Arrested

556
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:42,752
So if none of that goes Pub

557
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:45,312
+ 6

558
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:49,152
The censorship going on right now in alternative media

559
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:49,920
Continues

560
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:52,480
And YouTube is not rained in

561
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:53,504
And

562
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,784
Continues to censor

563
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,320
Those of us

564
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:57,344
Telling the truth

565
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:59,136
So these are some

566
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:01,184
Some fail safe ways

567
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,208
Determining

568
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,232
If

569
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:04,512
Trump is the real

570
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,816
These are all things that you

571
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:07,840
Until like if

572
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:09,888
These fail to happen

573
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:11,424
Isn't the real thing

574
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,472
None of those things will ever happen

575
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:14,240
Absolutely

576
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,056
Zero chance

577
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:19,616
You always end up in the

578
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:20,896
The conclusion that Trump

579
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:22,176
Is not for real

580
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:23,712
Yeah that's

581
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:25,760
That's a real set of

582
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:26,528
Criterion

583
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:31,904
To judge the guy you think is the good guy, some of them are kind of things that you could

584
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,952
To just do whatever you want with

585
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:36,256
Sure

586
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:39,840
African human trafficking stop like you could find ways to make

587
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:41,120
All sorts of like

588
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:47,520
Prostitution arrests are like Trump

589
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:51,616
If you wanted to make that one come true

590
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:52,640
Biog

591
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:54,432
Is probably going to happen

592
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:56,992
Amore expanded form

593
00:25:57,504 --> 00:26:00,320
Probably going to be not real according to you there

594
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:02,112
Vaccines are not

595
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:04,672
Probably going to become mandatory

596
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:05,440
But they're going

597
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:08,512
To be in the mandatory in the same way that they are now

598
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:12,352
And that's going to be a problem for you because you hate vaccine

599
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:14,656
Kohl's at mandatory

600
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:15,936
Is not real

601
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:17,984
Yes

602
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,520
Then just

603
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:20,288
Justin place

604
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,336
Just

605
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:23,360
Trump stops

606
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,896
Inflation forever

607
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:25,920
Yeah

608
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:28,480
Ludacris

609
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:32,576
Psiquiatra

610
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:35,648
We've already got the no bump into if he

611
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:37,440
Hides indictments for

612
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:43,840
The people who are

613
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:47,936
Soros in Alton

614
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:48,960
Right

615
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:49,984
Not going to happen

616
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,264
Talk to those people that kind of

617
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,288
Trump's going

618
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,312
Be shown to be fake

619
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:57,152
Are you there in the last 12 social media censorship

620
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,480
Did the Japanese Army

621
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:01,248
No chance

622
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:02,272
Trump is not going to

623
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,552
To get you back on YouTube

624
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:08,160
So you see a lot of parallel with what

625
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:10,720
Alex believe Trump needs to do the things

626
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:12,256
Thanks Trump isn't doing

627
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:15,584
That he wants him to do our things like fight 5G

628
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,656
Get rid of vaccine get me back on Twitter

629
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,472
Arrest my political enemies

630
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:23,008
Almost all of that

631
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:30,944
Standard destroy the Federal Reserve

632
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:31,968
Everything

633
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:34,016
It has a concrete connection with some

634
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:36,064
Something that does exist that isn't

635
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:36,832
Alien

636
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,368
Has a connection with Alex

637
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:44,256
And that's why you need to understand that people believe these sorts of same theories

638
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:46,304
Also might believe something like

639
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,072
This

640
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:48,864
Now the beaches are closed

641
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,888
Malibu

642
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:53,984
Could be a situation where

643
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:55,520
I mean who knows

644
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:56,800
Baby bottles

645
00:27:57,312 --> 00:28:00,896
It could be a situation where the County of Los Angeles County

646
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:05,504
I decided that we can't take the risk people are not being responsible around the country

647
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,600
Where are beaches are not closed they're all still congregate

648
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:16,000
And it's too big of a risk to the body politic we just need to close these public spaces that's what happens when you don't listen to the

649
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:17,536
People down there listening to the app

650
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:19,584
Epidemiologist closing down the beaches

651
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,144
Well it could be that it could be a concern

652
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:25,216
Could be something else

653
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:28,544
We know that in Malibu they're closing the beaches

654
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:32,128
They won't even let you park along PCH and spirit

655
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:32,896
The ocean

656
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:34,688
Which is what people were doing

657
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:35,968
Couple weekends ago

658
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,272
Having nice little parties in the car

659
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,344
Be more than 6 ft away from another car

660
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:44,160
But that wasn't good enough so then they stopped

661
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,696
They blocked off all the park

662
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:47,488
Hiking areas along PCH

663
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:48,512
In Malibu

664
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:50,048
And

665
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:51,840
You could go five miles north

666
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:54,912
Ventura beaches and you would be fine

667
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:57,472
And they would let you go on the beach excetera

668
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,264
But not in

669
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:00,800
What was la

670
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:02,592
What is LA County

671
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:03,360
Different County

672
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:08,480
The answer is either there is

673
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:13,344
There's a sea animal coming out of the sea only in the Malibu area

674
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,112
Cthulhu

675
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,160
They just

676
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:18,976
Hate us in don't we

677
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:21,792
Strelka closed all the trails and all the

678
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:23,328
Parks in Malibu as well

679
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:27,680
With no one around you you're still

680
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,472
You know suspect

681
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:31,776
Getting the viruses supposedly

682
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:34,592
But in reality these rules have nothing

683
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:35,616
What to do with them

684
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:37,920
They have nothing to do with

685
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:40,480
You know a social distancing which is a

686
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:41,504
Plot anyway

687
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:42,784
It's a plot

688
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,344
What they want to do is they don't want humans

689
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,368
Communicate

690
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:49,440
And I don't want humans to actually

691
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:53,024
Get close enough to share the truth and they certainly don't want you

692
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:54,560
To be able to

693
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:56,352
To Riot or do anything

694
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:57,376
Substantial

695
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:59,168
So they are

696
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:02,496
Enforcing the stupid mindset of

697
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:03,264
6 ft

698
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:11,200
I saw a sea monster

699
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:16,576
I'm 6 feet away you can't get the truth to me this far away

700
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:20,160
Alright so

701
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:22,208
Only two options

702
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,256
They hate you

703
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,536
Leviathan

704
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:29,632
This is this is

705
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:31,424
It seems unimportant

706
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,960
But it is very important

707
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:34,496
It's this level of

708
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:35,776
Thinking it's being brought

709
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:36,544
Two things

710
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:41,408
Is the same level of thinking that's required to end up in Alex's political

711
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:43,456
Abused as well

712
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:44,992
They both

713
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:46,016
Are the product

714
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:48,064
Incomplete

715
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,112
Prophecies

716
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:52,672
Alice's of thought of

717
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:54,976
Educational

718
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,280
Curiosity

719
00:30:57,792 --> 00:31:00,352
Takes a lot

720
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,376
To get you to

721
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:02,912
It's either a sea monster or they

722
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:06,240
Something is a plot

723
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:11,104
Would sink like normally I'd say

724
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:15,712
Carrie she just don't want to host the stupid YouTube show but it turns out she has other

725
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,504
I and I can

726
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,528
Can tell you that

727
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:23,136
In my view and I am a natural healer so I've been

728
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:26,720
Alright by Chinese Chi Master that I have very

729
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:28,000
Activated Chi

730
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,304
Etc and

731
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,120
So I do know intuitively

732
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:34,400
What is

733
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:35,424
Healing and what is not

734
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:37,472
And I can tell you that

735
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:38,752
This idea

736
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:40,544
I'm keeping 6 ft away is nonsense

737
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:46,944
Oh I didn't know that some Chinese guy

738
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:52,832
I should have known studies Incorporated

739
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:53,600
God

740
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:57,440
How do you hear if your if your

741
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:00,000
Kochi bastard

742
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:01,280
God beating Karim us

743
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:07,936
The best day of your life $7,000 a month

744
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:15,360
So when someone tells me that there are natural intuitive healer and they know everything

745
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:18,176
Feel it with Archie

746
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:18,944
Point

747
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:20,224
Determine

748
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,016
What are what kind of thing they bring into

749
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:24,320
The table cuz obviously I can't to ask him

750
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:27,648
Can she give me a Kamehameha

751
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,184
Could you give me a cheap glass

752
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:32,768
I don't know but she can give you a blast

753
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:34,560
Absurdity

754
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:35,840
Which is business wear

755
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:37,888
This is where ShakeOut real tonight

756
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,472
We Are Spiritual Beings having a material experience

757
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,080
Any sickness as I've said in my other vehicle video starts first

758
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:48,640
In the layers Above This

759
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:49,664
So this is the

760
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,968
The physical layer this is where it comes last

761
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,016
So even a bio-weapon

762
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:55,808
Put Out Among Us

763
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,088
To make you sick

764
00:32:57,344 --> 00:33:01,184
Is something that you have to decide in your higher levels of cell

765
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:02,720
Weather to bring in

766
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:04,512
To move an ant

767
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:05,792
Out of your system

768
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:10,400
That's where I got a little worried about advice from the show

769
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:11,680
You have to decide

770
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:14,240
To get sick

771
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:16,544
Old-time puritanical

772
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,312
Christian

773
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:20,640
Feeling to it

774
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:25,760
Old kind of moralizing about illness

775
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:27,296
Like somehow it diseases at

776
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:29,088
Deficiency of you

777
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:30,368
A tree leaf

778
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:37,024
Humor's earning alignment Dan because you were mean to your little sister and that's

779
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,816
What you're sick and now everybody's got the

780
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:42,656
Play I mean if you believe this if you believe you

781
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:45,984
How old is he's basically is something that you have to

782
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,056
Your spirit has to allow it nor accept

783
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:49,824
Then it does

784
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:51,872
You would look

785
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:52,896
Look down on sick

786
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:53,664
Sick people

787
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,200
You would look down on people with

788
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:56,480
Electronic

789
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:57,504
Conditions is because

790
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:03,648
That's some sort of a failing on their part absolutely

791
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:07,488
Lupus

792
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,048
It's

793
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:14,912
If it's a really troubling I don't know if she's hinted at this in the past but it's

794
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:16,448
Felt a little new to me

795
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:19,008
It felt like a element of her character

796
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:24,640
That I wasn't aware of that I had I haven't talked this much about

797
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,920
Not good

798
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:31,040
Things even now you still think that there's a general agreement that it's

799
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:32,576
Like we're taking this one

800
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:33,344
For granted

801
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,368
Germs are real

802
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:35,392
That's how we're doing it

803
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:37,184
That's just what we're going to do today

804
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,488
And forever and apparently I was wrong

805
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,512
About the others real

806
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:41,280
Fundamentals

807
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:45,376
What is she think Adams Armada

808
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:47,168
Adam's a real how do you get

809
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:47,936
Nadeau's

810
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:52,800
And not have germ Theory at the same time

811
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,552
Extra when you have Zack

812
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:05,856
Kind of weak not going to win

813
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:07,904
Process is going to end up

814
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:13,536
Hey talk about nanoparticles and all this weirdo dumb science

815
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:15,328
But also at the same time

816
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:17,120
Except diseases it in your spirit

817
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:18,144
So don't have to accept

818
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:23,520
The nanoparticles if they are the disease in your spirit are you

819
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:30,176
Oh cuz they're too small we can't hurt you unless you accept it be it hurting you why should you ever be worried

820
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:32,736
About what any evil forces doing

821
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,040
Weak people out there this isn't for her

822
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:36,064
Richie's to straw

823
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:38,624
Play the Chinese Chi Master told her

824
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:43,232
She got the best you she's ever wired she have that bull Taylor attack

825
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:46,048
But you were so worried about a

826
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:47,584
Walking now I don't care

827
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:48,608
Anyway

828
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:50,656
It's not just her saying that she hasn't asked for

829
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:52,448
This dude

830
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:55,520
According to Robert Young

831
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:56,800
There are

832
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:57,824
Dr. Robert Young

833
00:35:58,336 --> 00:35:59,104
There is

834
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:00,384
A doctor

835
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:04,736
Basically an indoor internal environment and an external environment

836
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:07,296
So in terms of the Earthly level

837
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:10,368
He's talkin spell exclusively about that

838
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,672
And I are highly recommend his

839
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:13,952
Disinformation

840
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:18,048
He's also one of the people who was well aware in the early days

841
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:21,376
Of what is it basically what we call MMS

842
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:22,656
Chlorine dioxide

843
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:24,448
And healing properties

844
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,472
And abilities

845
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:26,752
It it has

846
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,288
To heal everything

847
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:29,568
And he also

848
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:32,128
The talks about there being basically only 12

849
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,152
When

850
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:34,176
When disease

851
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:35,968
In-N-Out

852
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:38,016
Oh my God that's all you need is one method

853
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:39,040
Taking logs

854
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:41,856
Bleach

855
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:43,136
Subway

856
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:50,048
I do not thank God thank you sir Sunday thank the Lord

857
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:51,584
Robert Young

858
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:56,704
But he's actually way more not a doctor than most of the other people to carry reference car

859
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,984
Because unlike people like

860
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,288
Kalker Hooda solicit terrible advice

861
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:01,312
Robert Young

862
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:02,336
Actually decided to

863
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:04,640
Pretend to be a practicing license doctor

864
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:05,664
Which he was not

865
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:11,296
Here's a little bit from June 29th 2017 article in the San Diego Union-Tribune

866
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:14,624
The author of the popular pH miracle

867
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:21,024
Book series will spend the next five months in jail after admitting that he illegally treated patients at his luxuries Valley Center Ranch

868
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,816
Without any medical or scientific

869
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:23,584
Epic training

870
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:27,680
He previously been convicted of two counts of practicing medicine without a license

871
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:32,544
He's also arrested in 1995 and 2001 for practicing without a license

872
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:33,824
Is Dude Love

873
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:39,712
Those practicing medicine without being in any way qualified to do so

874
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:43,040
Programmable weed with this dude can fall spread

875
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:49,440
Does medicine over and over and over again to get five bucks but this justice system

876
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:54,816
It came out that young supposed to grease came from a Bachelors

877
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:56,096
Degree and doctorate

878
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:59,680
Within the span of eight months in 1995 flautas

879
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:01,728
Impossible

880
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:04,544
School he might be a genius maybe still in pain

881
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:09,664
Robert Young gets of jail time recently for pretending to be a doctor but that wasn't it

882
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:15,552
In November 2018 the San Diego Union-Tribune reported on a Civil Trial brought against Young by one of his

883
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:16,320
His patients who had

884
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:17,088
Cancer

885
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:18,112
Who claimed t quote

886
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:20,416
Held himself out as a doctor and councils hurt

887
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:22,464
24go traditional medical treatment

888
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:23,744
And of course

889
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,536
Cancer got worse

890
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:31,936
Victim was awarded 105 million dollars by the jury which was over double what you assume

891
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:35,264
Because f*** that I would go with

892
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,056
Still too small

893
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:39,104
This is a guy

894
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,920
Who is Leah Felder

895
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:46,272
The rest of us f****** life

896
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:52,672
Yeah he had the luxury lifestyle and then by the end of this case yet

897
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:53,696
Do the public attorney

898
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:55,488
Public defender

899
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:56,768
It's one of those

900
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:59,584
Feel good lines in a in a news article look like

901
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:02,144
This guy who made millions of dollars

902
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,168
Telling people this

903
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,960
Bulshit Brad doctor

904
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:06,496
Having to like

905
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:09,568
Basically the broke by the end of Alec

906
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:10,848
Obviously I don't

907
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,152
Necessarily want someone to be

908
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:13,920
Punished

909
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:16,736
More harshly than is deserve

910
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:18,528
But all those ill-gotten gains

911
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:19,808
Should be splitting

912
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:20,832
Gone

913
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:23,136
She should also have been given

914
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:27,232
Boeing like that's how much that guy should have been sued she gets a mask

915
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,560
We got to give it to you

916
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:34,912
Andreas kalcker the guy who wants to drink bleach

917
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:35,680
And

918
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:40,288
Robert Young

919
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,568
Pretending to be a doctor

920
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:42,848
These are the people

921
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:44,384
Carrie thinks of legitimate

922
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:46,176
These are the people

923
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:51,552
Like Alex who has unlike Steve pieczenik all these nonsense dingdong weirdos

924
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:54,624
They're just Alex's version is a little higher

925
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:56,160
Except for

926
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:58,208
Some of these people lately who are

927
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:01,536
At least Alex used veterinarian as it

928
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:03,840
Yeah

929
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:07,424
And a chiropractor

930
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,264
Based on their oppositional Defiance disorder like

931
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:16,128
To jail only proves how really was you know that's

932
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:17,664
Central Elementary

933
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,200
That's a very interesting talk

934
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:21,248
Masks are stupid

935
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,528
According to

936
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:25,600
Scary and she has

937
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:28,672
Talks a little bit more about this idea of like you have to want

938
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:29,440
To get sick

939
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:30,464
In order to get sick

940
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:32,768
And I see people out in nature

941
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:34,816
Stupid masks on

942
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:35,840
Which is also looted

943
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,680
So as far as I'm concerned this

944
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:40,448
It just is.

945
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:41,216
Dr. Robb

946
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:42,496
Robert Young says

947
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:45,056
It's not possible to actually catch

948
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:47,616
This or any other disease from other humans

949
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:48,896
You

950
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:49,664
Actually

951
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,432
How to make

952
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:51,968
The decision to bring it in

953
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:55,552
We tend to resonate with each other so if you live in the same house

954
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:57,600
You're breathing the same air and hanging out

955
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:59,136
With other people in the same

956
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:00,160
Environment

957
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,184
We are

958
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:02,720
Basically

959
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:06,048
Senders and receivers and we tent

960
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,840
People tend to

961
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:09,120
Reflect

962
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:10,656
The disease is that

963
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:11,680
Set those around them

964
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:13,472
Have and decide whether or not

965
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:14,240
2

966
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:15,008
Actually manage

967
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:15,776
Pesto's

968
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:17,056
Their sickness is as well

969
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:17,824
Themselves

970
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:19,104
This is

971
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:20,896
You know it all to mately

972
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:21,664
The real

973
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:25,760
What we really are as humans in our spiritual abilities

974
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:27,552
Are going to be more and more known

975
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:31,648
And of course the X-Men movies try to make these things

976
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:33,184
Oh God hears

977
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:35,744
Watch bigger story than

978
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,024
What's movies are showing

979
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:41,120
Star Auto

980
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:42,400
Are telling you

981
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:44,448
Well

982
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:50,848
You know we got to the point where it's either Godzilla

983
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:52,640
Or they hate you and

984
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:55,455
X-Men movies were trying to warn us about that then

985
00:41:56,735 --> 00:42:00,063
Diseases unless you want to

986
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,087
Saying we're right

987
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:03,135
If you have people in your home who get sick

988
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:04,927
You'll get sick

989
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:05,951
Because your likes

990
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:07,231
Sympathizing with Elmer's

991
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:09,791
Make sense for like

992
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:10,815
Asymptomatic

993
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:12,351
God transmission or

994
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:15,679
Obviously there were cases of people

995
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:22,079
You know you don't know your sake and then you get someone else sick

996
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:24,383
Your family

997
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:25,663
Check transmission work

998
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:31,039
Around 4 that would be like your soul knows

999
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:33,343
F****** magical thinking

1000
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:34,367
No

1001
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:35,135
But you have

1002
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:36,415
Like your soul has to

1003
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:38,207
Except the Delaney's sure

1004
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:40,511
But then the next clip becomes a problem then

1005
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:42,047
I understand that

1006
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:43,327
The elderly

1007
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:44,607
And

1008
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:47,679
People even young people with weakened immune system

1009
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:53,055
That have been sitting you no eating junk food and staring at electronics for since they were born Pratt

1010
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:56,383
I mean you can understand there is a

1011
00:42:56,639 --> 00:43:00,479
There is an epidemic of a weakened immune system of humanity here on

1012
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:01,759
On planet Earth

1013
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:02,527
About that

1014
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:06,367
And most people don't even know what Kundalini is let alone

1015
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:10,207
Orgone or meditating and how to remove elenion

1016
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:12,511
At and

1017
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:13,791
Join them and

1018
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:16,095
And get to sumati excetera

1019
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:20,191
Said right which I have done and I can talk

1020
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:21,215
Worth it

1021
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:26,079
What can I tell you I

1022
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:29,407
Buddha Guru

1023
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:32,991
Whatever you like I reach somebody a long time ago

1024
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:36,063
I got a giant T-Bone

1025
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:38,879
Worth it

1026
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:40,927
The problem I have there is

1027
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:45,023
If you don't believe in disease why do we have immune system

1028
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:47,071
I don't understand

1029
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:49,631
Problem

1030
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:53,727
Problem those are put in there by the globalist

1031
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:57,567
I'm sorry the interdimensional evil beings right

1032
00:43:57,823 --> 00:44:01,151
Convinced just like how Jesus put the dinosaurs in there

1033
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:01,919
To make you think

1034
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:04,991
The Earth was older than 6,000 years Dan but it's not

1035
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:05,759
It's a test of

1036
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:06,783
Okay

1037
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:10,879
In that case why is it a problem that we have weakened immune systems

1038
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:14,207
Your immune system isn't protecting you from diseases that you

1039
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:14,975
Can catch

1040
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:16,767
From things like I don't know

1041
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:17,535
Eating dirt

1042
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:19,583
Or something cuz if you're

1043
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:21,887
Weakened immune system is

1044
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:23,679
Inward out

1045
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:24,959
Go to the spirit

1046
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:28,031
Then the spirit immune system is weakened

1047
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:30,335
Boy this one doesn't make

1048
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:35,199
Scary believe that all of this is spiritual

1049
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:38,783
You're going to just be staying where you're sympathetic responses

1050
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:42,623
The people we hate everyone

1051
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:46,207
If you hate everyone but you will never get sick

1052
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:48,255
You're impervious

1053
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:51,839
To disease if you are the biggest misanthrope in the world

1054
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:54,911
The only person who has never been sick in his entire life

1055
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:57,471
With the Unabomber Dan and I believe that to be true

1056
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:58,751
I guarantee that is

1057
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:02,079
Never have a sympathetic reaction to anybody

1058
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:07,455
Cleanse yourself of any empathy or human emotion

1059
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:09,759
And you'll never be sick

1060
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:12,831
So

1061
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:15,647
Carrie in the sex club talks about how the bad guys

1062
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:18,975
For all intensive purposes

1063
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:24,607
Domino's they got a knockdown right to get the economy the disease whatever course at the same time

1064
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:29,471
Just like dominoes and they might be using psychic

1065
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:30,751
In order to make

1066
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:31,775
Their plans

1067
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:32,543
But

1068
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:33,823
So is drop

1069
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:34,847
And so

1070
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:35,871
They have

1071
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:41,503
To do these Domino's all together and one can imagine their using things like Looking Glass Pro

1072
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:42,527
Sick looking glass

1073
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:45,087
They're also using

1074
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:46,111
One could imagine that

1075
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:47,391
Used to be called Craig

1076
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:50,207
Computers that are now basically probably d-wave

1077
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:51,743
Which is Geordie Rose the

1078
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:52,511
The five

1079
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:53,791
You know going into the

1080
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:56,607
Dimension looking in the future trying to find

1081
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:57,375
Hi

1082
00:45:57,631 --> 00:45:58,399
Probabilities

1083
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:00,703
Absolutely will work and what won't work

1084
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:02,751
So they're they're basically

1085
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:03,519
Figuring out at

1086
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:05,823
Trajectory for their moves

1087
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:08,127
There is some evidence that Trump

1088
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:10,943
Qanon and team are doing the same thing

1089
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:13,247
In other words using precog

1090
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:15,295
That's using remote viewers

1091
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:16,063
Using

1092
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:18,111
There is a heaven

1093
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:23,487
Try to strategically figure out how to navigate

1094
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:24,511
The future

1095
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:26,047
And being a cop

1096
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:26,815
Competition

1097
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:28,095
Each other

1098
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:31,423
Teams of Psychics working against each other

1099
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:32,447
Get sick

1100
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:39,359
Have control over their mind Powers right

1101
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:40,639
Push-out disease

1102
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:42,431
Think they couldn't

1103
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:44,479
Also anybody

1104
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:47,807
None of these people that you know should be in prison

1105
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:48,575
If

1106
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:49,855
They have psychic friend

1107
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:51,135
Sean David Morton

1108
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:57,023
Is like a remote viewer and all this s*** he shouldn't have gone to prison for fraud

1109
00:46:58,303 --> 00:46:59,327
Maybe it's part of his

1110
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:02,655
Or perhaps

1111
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:03,679
Perhaps this

1112
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:05,215
What the psychics and the Pea

1113
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:06,495
Precogs alno

1114
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:07,263
Is that

1115
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:11,359
There is absolutely predestination and so he had no choice

1116
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:12,383
Play it out like

1117
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:16,479
I would imagine that being able to see the future in a system of

1118
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:18,015
Destination

1119
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:18,783
Bummer

1120
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:21,343
Probably be best not to tell

1121
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:23,135
People that everything's freezing

1122
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:29,279
Similarities of Alex just like

1123
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:32,095
Some of the villains are the same

1124
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:33,375
And why these narratives

1125
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:37,215
Are very very similar once you strip away aliens and everything

1126
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:40,031
As I said it's going to be very

1127
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:41,055
For Trump to stay

1128
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:41,823
Step forward

1129
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:42,591
To fire

1130
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:43,871
A cheat for one thing

1131
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:46,175
To get rid of Bill Gates

1132
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:47,455
Arrest him

1133
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:48,991
And silence him

1134
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:50,783
And I and I

1135
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:54,623
And Melinda Gates for that matter and and and basically

1136
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:55,903
Take down

1137
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:57,951
This is very dark

1138
00:47:58,207 --> 00:47:58,975
Deep state

1139
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:00,767
That goes into the secret space

1140
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:02,303
Is program now how far they're go

1141
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:03,583
Going to be able to go

1142
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,631
With all of it I don't know

1143
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:08,959
But I can tell you that keeping you in your houses

1144
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:12,287
Is not stopping them from doing their operation so that

1145
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:13,311
Nonsense

1146
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:14,847
If someone tells you that

1147
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:16,127
That's not what's

1148
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:18,687
What is really happening is

1149
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:19,711
That the

1150
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:20,735
Dark

1151
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:21,759
Deep state

1152
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:24,063
Is basically rolling out

1153
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:25,855
A global

1154
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:28,415
Artificially intelligent

1155
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:30,207
Linked-up

1156
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:31,487
Through 5G

1157
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:34,047
And Nano and an n

1158
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:35,839
And targeting more words

1159
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:38,143
And putting words words words

1160
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:39,679
Get their vaccine off the ground

1161
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:41,471
This is the

1162
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:42,239
The endgame

1163
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:43,519
Game that they're working on

1164
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:49,919
It's the endgame

1165
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:56,319
Eid

1166
00:48:56,575 --> 00:49:00,415
Vaccines the tattoo that will track you

1167
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:01,439
Call Vince

1168
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:02,463
All the same

1169
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:03,999
All the same

1170
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:05,279
Because this is dumb

1171
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:06,815
This is bad

1172
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:10,143
Aside from Aliens she's she's just like

1173
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:12,447
Double white lady Trump

1174
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:16,287
She just has aliens on top of everything other than that just feel like

1175
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:22,175
My kids are bad for playing video games and it's kind of a way to be condescending within that

1176
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:23,455
Space a little bit

1177
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:24,735
It's interesting

1178
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:31,391
It's and it's like oh yeah you all know this but I know even more

1179
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:32,671
Cheese

1180
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:37,279
Raptor you guys think qanon is cool but it check out my cheese

1181
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:38,815
Off-the-charts

1182
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:43,167
Qanon Karim I believe some of the parts

1183
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:49,311
If you were not particularly

1184
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:50,591
It's My Hope

1185
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:52,383
That is true that JFK

1186
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:55,199
Junior is alive and working with Trump

1187
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:56,223
Why

1188
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:57,247
Sincerely hope that's

1189
00:49:57,503 --> 00:49:58,783
That's the case then I think that would

1190
00:49:59,295 --> 00:49:59,807
Be a very

1191
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:00,575
Good thing

1192
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:01,343
Why

1193
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:05,695
And I'm told I am too and on says in in there

1194
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:06,975
Broadcast

1195
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:07,743
Not

1196
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:09,023
But in there

1197
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:10,047
Text

1198
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:11,583
That they

1199
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:17,983
Plan to come out in July they also say there's going to be a disclosure announcement to do with ET in July

1200
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:19,007
The weather.

1201
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:25,407
That's going to be Alien Invasion or weather is really going to be a real disclosure with some

1202
00:50:25,663 --> 00:50:26,687
Intelligence behind it

1203
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:28,735
I don't know you certainly don't

1204
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:30,783
And I can't wait for that

1205
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:34,879
You have no idea ladies enjoy

1206
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:37,439
So she's already said

1207
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:38,207
A game

1208
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:40,767
And she does it again she's using it a bit

1209
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:45,119
It's interesting because of the way she's framing at and using the term

1210
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:46,911
It's very similar to Alex

1211
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:49,215
Conception of

1212
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:53,055
The New World Order is doing right now

1213
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:55,103
They have decided that we're at the

1214
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:56,895
The endgame here on planet Earth

1215
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:59,199
Until they have to baby

1216
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:00,479
Bear Armageddon

1217
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:03,039
And it is based on the Playbook

1218
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:04,319
Witches in the Bible

1219
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:05,855
And sorry

1220
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:06,623
4

1221
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:07,391
Horsemen of the

1222
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:10,207
Apocalypse everything that's in the Bible

1223
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:14,047
Will be adhered to by the Illuminati as

1224
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:14,815
On

1225
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:17,375
Rolling out their new one world order

1226
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:21,983
Alex's stuff like that quite a bit I mean talks about how either Revelation is

1227
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:22,751
Trueandco

1228
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:24,287
Completely accurate

1229
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:26,079
The globalist are using it as a

1230
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:26,847
Template

1231
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:27,615
You know it's

1232
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:31,199
It's all the same people are similar

1233
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:33,503
Is she pretty or post-trib rapture

1234
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:36,831
I mean if she's pre

1235
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:41,951
That's the only reason that you can Alex own catalog

1236
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:53,983
You brought up the oppositional defiance

1237
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:57,567
Our earlier additives really insightful because I

1238
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:58,591
Carrie

1239
00:51:58,847 --> 00:51:59,359
My

1240
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:02,175
I don't see whatever chats she's getting

1241
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:06,527
But I think someone might have pointed out that Robert Young got arrested

1242
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:07,807
Super faking being a doctor

1243
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:10,367
Is she has a little bit of a response to it

1244
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:11,391
You might have

1245
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:12,159
Have been

1246
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:17,279
I mean I don't want to say that you're have a great Chi energy

1247
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:20,351
Orion natural psychic

1248
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:21,631
Giving her exact

1249
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:23,935
Rebuttal Looking Glass

1250
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:27,519
I don't think they even understand viruses and I think that there's

1251
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:28,543
I don't think you are

1252
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:30,847
But I'm not an expert

1253
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:31,871
So I'm not going to

1254
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:33,663
Be able to stay

1255
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:37,759
One way or another what a virus is I can say dr. Young

1256
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:41,087
Gives you a very convincing argument for what

1257
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:44,671
But it is and I you should read his papers on his website

1258
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:47,743
Watch his videos watch my interview with him

1259
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:50,559
And maybe you'll begin to glean

1260
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:54,655
What is really being said and what's true about viruses and what isn't

1261
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:56,447
Now

1262
00:52:57,215 --> 00:53:01,055
What else and by the way anybody who is arrested

1263
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:02,591
You know

1264
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:04,127
Disinfect

1265
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:06,687
Credited excetera by the Deep state

1266
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:07,967
Is a lot more like

1267
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:09,759
Likely to be telling the real truth

1268
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:11,551
Then someone who is lauded

1269
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:18,207
On some platform and has all these Awards except you wanted us to listen to the people when the system Rewards

1270
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:20,255
It's very possible

1271
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:21,023
That

1272
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:22,559
That person is not telling

1273
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:24,095
And the truth in some

1274
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:25,631
They're playing the pie

1275
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:27,167
They are

1276
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:30,239
Basically on board with the Deep state

1277
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:31,007
Agenda

1278
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:33,823
So just keep that in mind for all of you who think

1279
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:37,663
Do they been in jail or do their you know this or that

1280
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:40,479
Just like people to attack Mark Richards.

1281
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:41,503
Captain Mark Richards

1282
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:44,063
For murdering that got

1283
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:45,087
Open frame for murder

1284
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:46,367
Hello that's

1285
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:48,415
Tell you he's probably telling the truth

1286
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:53,023
I mean people do not be

1287
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:55,071
As to not understand

1288
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:58,911
Our entire world is run by the Deep state

1289
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:00,191
It's the

1290
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:01,215
Darkseid

1291
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:04,287
So this is these are the people they love

1292
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:05,567
Are the people that are

1293
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:06,335
Probably

1294
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:07,359
Worth hating

1295
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:08,127
If you want to

1296
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:08,895
Bothered

1297
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:10,175
Put that energy out there

1298
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:11,967
Which I don't

1299
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:12,991
You do

1300
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:15,295
Tell you I know a liar when I see one

1301
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:19,647
That's the funniest wow wow

1302
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:20,671
You are not allowed

1303
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:24,255
I know a liar when I see one

1304
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:26,303
HarborWalk

1305
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:30,911
You know

1306
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:32,959
Yeah I mean

1307
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:35,519
The problem was that sort of thinking

1308
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:36,543
Is

1309
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:38,591
How do you determine who is the

1310
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:40,895
Discredited by this deep state

1311
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:42,943
Who's been discredited by being

1312
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:43,967
A little

1313
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:47,295
Who has discredited themselves

1314
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:50,111
How do you differentiate between the two and I think it just

1315
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:50,879
Compass tattoo

1316
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:52,927
Where do you watch an exactly

1317
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:53,695
Absolute win

1318
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:54,975
Because

1319
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:55,999
You're right I mean

1320
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:57,791
I bet there are 100 people

1321
00:54:58,047 --> 00:55:00,863
In prison for murder who have a great story to tell

1322
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:05,215
Could be exactly the same as Mark Richards

1323
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:08,799
I imagine she complained 106

1324
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:10,591
Space Program whistleblowers

1325
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:16,479
In all sorts of places

1326
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:24,159
I bet that there are a number of people who also would tell her things that don't line up with her narratives and she would

1327
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:27,487
Write the probably

1328
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:28,511
Put in prison

1329
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:30,815
As a psyop against her or something

1330
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:33,631
It's a yeah it's all just whatever you want

1331
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:34,399
To believe

1332
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:36,703
You want to believe that this Robert Young

1333
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:37,727
Is

1334
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:40,799
Right about stuff and they're for his crimes

1335
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:41,567
And his

1336
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:42,591
Direct

1337
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:44,639
But you did to people

1338
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:47,967
Is the Deep state discrediting

1339
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:49,759
A guy who

1340
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:51,807
Committed crimes

1341
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:54,623
You know what when the crimes are fraud

1342
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:56,159
Import

1343
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:57,695
Has an impact

1344
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:59,231
On other claims

1345
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:05,119
Did liar multiple times over

1346
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:08,191
I am going to go with I'm not going to trust what you have

1347
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:13,055
That's just me crimes like if you're in prison for some crimes

1348
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:15,103
But might not ruin your credit

1349
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:18,687
Like if you were in prison for selling drugs or something like that

1350
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:20,991
That doesn't necessarily impact

1351
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:27,647
What I would say your ability to be taken as a credible source of information

1352
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:30,975
When you were somebody who is doing a bid for a

1353
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:33,023
Radu related crime

1354
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:36,607
That does have an impact it matters

1355
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:38,399
Gary refuses to recognize that

1356
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:40,959
Cuz she likes fraud people

1357
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:44,287
She likes bleach people

1358
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:47,359
Who are a subset of fraud people

1359
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:51,199
All I hear there is just there's no hope

1360
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:56,063
No that's all I hear is that all I hear is there is I will never listen to

1361
00:56:57,343 --> 00:56:58,111
Ever ever

1362
00:56:58,623 --> 00:56:59,391
Not going to happen

1363
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:00,671
I know I can

1364
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:03,487
Can spot a liar is the saddest sentence

1365
00:57:03,743 --> 00:57:05,023
Anybody could

1366
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:07,583
Yeah I mean if you look

1367
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:09,119
I mean if you look through

1368
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:11,423
The list of people that she's interviewed

1369
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:13,471
I've been like this person gets it

1370
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:19,103
I'm going to truthsayer I get it

1371
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:24,223
I can absolutely you tell when people are lying all the time

1372
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:26,527
Idaho lottery winners who won

1373
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:30,623
My Skype you from this first report from Tuesday

1374
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:32,159
And it's interesting

1375
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:36,511
She said endgame a couple times she's definitely referencing a bunch of

1376
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:37,279
Narratives

1377
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:39,071
Heavy overlap with Alex

1378
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:42,143
And now she ended the show with Alex's literal catch

1379
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:44,447
I do want to say

1380
00:57:45,471 --> 00:57:46,751
You Are Not Alone

1381
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:50,079
There are pockets of resistance all over the planet

1382
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:54,943
That I am Kerry Cassidy you are watching this you are

1383
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:55,711
Are they resist

1384
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:56,479
Fence

1385
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:58,271
If you're watching this

1386
00:57:58,527 --> 00:58:00,319
You are the resistance

1387
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:04,927
Who plays in voice-over bumpers and out of commercial breaks on Alex's show

1388
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:09,023
Report

1389
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:12,351
Terminator Salvation or something

1390
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:18,751
More importantly in the conspiracy world something that Alex has branded

1391
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:21,823
The answer to 1984 is 1776

1392
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:26,687
Could be in a movie somewhere and if you're quoting it you're still quoting Alex

1393
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:28,991
He's on he's taking it

1394
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:29,759
Man

1395
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:32,831
It's there's too much overlap with Alex on this

1396
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:34,111
2 Frisbie Court

1397
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:34,879
Incidental

1398
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:37,183
Although that makes sense for somebody like

1399
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:40,767
Swery Carey to start going that direction is because

1400
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:41,791
In a crisis

1401
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:43,071
Instinct

1402
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:44,863
Is to-go megalomania

1403
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:51,263
You know like she before she was telling you about the Deep State no big deal I can see the future I can

1404
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:52,287
Remote

1405
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:55,359
View I'm a psychic I'm all of this stuff

1406
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:56,127
Is a crisis

1407
00:58:56,383 --> 00:58:57,407
She's like

1408
00:58:57,663 --> 00:58:58,943
F****** leader of the resistance

1409
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:01,759
Since now she is too strong

1410
00:59:02,015 --> 00:59:05,855
Basically Sarah Connor

1411
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:08,159
38

1412
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:10,207
There's another video that you put out

1413
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:12,255
Be honest

1414
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:14,047
I probably wouldn't cover this one either

1415
00:59:14,303 --> 00:59:15,327
Except for habitats

1416
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:18,655
Why did Wilder theories I never heard suggested

1417
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:21,471
It's not accurate

1418
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:25,823
Has a problem for her

1419
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:27,871
No one gets sick unless they want

1420
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:29,919
Two theories that sounds right

1421
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:30,687
But

1422
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:34,527
Comes with an idea like this

1423
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:35,807
You can't not

1424
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:37,087
Tell people about it

1425
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:41,951
If you're listening to the right

1426
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:44,255
To this right now you are obviously

1427
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:46,559
Build this up before the neck

1428
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:47,583
Text 45 minutes

1429
00:59:48,095 --> 00:59:49,887
And it would still not disappoint

1430
00:59:50,911 --> 00:59:51,679
What what

1431
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:52,959
More

1432
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:54,239
Surprising

1433
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:56,287
I'm really tired

1434
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:59,103
Restart

1435
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:02,175
And apparently she has another source

1436
01:00:02,431 --> 01:00:03,967
Of a guy who

1437
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:05,759
Had some idea

1438
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:09,599
George Webb did a video that actually related directly to

1439
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:10,879
My recent article

1440
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:11,903
Which I wrote

1441
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:13,183
I think was yesterday

1442
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:14,463
Or the day before

1443
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:15,999
End

1444
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:18,047
Basically

1445
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:19,583
George is talking about

1446
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:21,375
Information

1447
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:24,447
That appears to be factual related to

1448
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:27,519
What's involved in the

1449
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:30,079
Show called Stevie and it

1450
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:30,847
It has

1451
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:34,431
Come from it's basically he he nicknames that have

1452
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:35,455
Bat virus

1453
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:36,735
And says it has

1454
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:37,503
Protein

1455
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:38,271
Covering the

1456
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:39,551
Receives the body

1457
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:40,575
Intuit

1458
01:00:40,831 --> 01:00:42,111
Accepting the virus to covering a

1459
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:43,391
Protein is called

1460
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:45,695
Glycoprotein 120

1461
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:48,511
And apparently back in 1985

1462
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:50,047
Waterfowl key

1463
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:51,583
Profound she was

1464
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:54,143
Who is obviously that

1465
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:55,935
Start of CDC

1466
01:00:56,703 --> 01:00:58,239
I think he's a CDC guy that

1467
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:00,031
With Trump

1468
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:04,639
And and hopefully will be fired soon

1469
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:10,527
Who was involved in developing that protein covering and without that protein covering

1470
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:12,575
Our body would just naturally

1471
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:13,343
Reject

1472
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:14,111
The virus

1473
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:16,415
This is a spirit

1474
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:20,255
And if he hears that he has some background in this field

1475
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:22,815
So I'm not even going to even

1476
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:23,583
Care enough

1477
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:27,935
How to get into the content I don't even think I was going well thinking about

1478
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:31,007
Delivering this information wanted to talk about

1479
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:36,127
The first is at the end there where Carrie says that her Source in the mechanics of this virus

1480
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:37,407
George Webb

1481
01:01:37,663 --> 01:01:39,455
Accused

1482
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:40,991
He appears to

1483
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:44,831
Terry doesn't even actually know if there's any idea what he's talking about

1484
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:48,671
Bake fauci look evil

1485
01:01:48,927 --> 01:01:52,255
She's going to assume that he's got the background in the field

1486
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:57,887
This is what someone who's very clearly engage in the practice of believing whatever the f*** they want to.

1487
01:01:58,399 --> 01:01:59,423
But they're also

1488
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:00,447
Trying to insist

1489
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:01,471
But they're following the process

1490
01:02:01,983 --> 01:02:02,751
There's not good

1491
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:04,543
And also like you

1492
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:06,847
Responded to you can tell that you just winging it

1493
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:07,615
Because

1494
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:09,151
That's a major problem

1495
01:02:09,663 --> 01:02:11,711
Is there some random glycoprotein

1496
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:12,735
It shouldn't matter

1497
01:02:13,247 --> 01:02:14,271
If diseases aren't

1498
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:15,807
You have to decide to

1499
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:17,855
Which is what Kerry has its

1500
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:19,391
Breast is being her belief

1501
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:22,463
Did you have two wheeler disease into yourself and Engineering that

1502
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:23,743
Disease shouldn't matter

1503
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:25,023
Shouldn't have any effect

1504
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:26,047
On anything

1505
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:31,679
The idea that

1506
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:32,703
You can just be like

1507
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:37,567
Well he appears to be reasonable and since I know how to spot a liar I'm just going to assume that he is

1508
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:40,127
He didn't seem like he was lying to beso

1509
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:41,151
There you go

1510
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:43,199
No

1511
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:43,967
They like

1512
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:45,759
You can't get sick

1513
01:02:48,575 --> 01:02:54,719
Absolute way to get tickets to will it do yourself

1514
01:02:54,975 --> 01:02:55,743
He spent the last

1515
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:57,279
35 years

1516
01:02:57,535 --> 01:03:00,607
Having their engineer this glycoprotein

1517
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:02,143
Oh God so stupid

1518
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:05,471
It just doesn't matter nothing matters

1519
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:06,495
Why doesn't

1520
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:07,775
It really doesn't

1521
01:03:08,031 --> 01:03:08,799
Big part of that is because

1522
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:10,335
Is Carrie's working on two different

1523
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:12,383
There's this sort of like

1524
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:17,503
Man human potential bigger than our

1525
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:20,575
Your higher self allows a disease in or whatever

1526
01:03:21,087 --> 01:03:22,879
It's kind of a hippy-dippy our version of

1527
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:24,159
Of this belief system

1528
01:03:24,671 --> 01:03:28,511
Yeah the second track in that is this paranoid New World Order

1529
01:03:29,535 --> 01:03:30,303
Conspiracy stuff

1530
01:03:31,071 --> 01:03:32,607
Are you trying to run both of these tracks

1531
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:34,655
And they are not

1532
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:35,679
Complimentary

1533
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:39,007
And also the problem is that she likes the paranoid one

1534
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:40,543
Itsfunneh

1535
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:41,823
It's probably more interesting

1536
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:42,591
4 people

1537
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:44,639
It's it allows you to

1538
01:03:44,895 --> 01:03:46,175
Express a little bit more anger

1539
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:48,479
Yeah I probably is more profitable

1540
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:50,783
So I think that you probably just

1541
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:53,855
Like entertainment level enjoys it more

1542
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:55,903
Do you have you have

1543
01:03:56,159 --> 01:03:56,671
Things like

1544
01:03:57,695 --> 01:03:58,207
You know

1545
01:03:58,719 --> 01:04:02,047
They're trying to get everyone sick with is engineered thing right

1546
01:04:02,303 --> 01:04:03,583
That seems to be

1547
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:08,191
Completely undone by the spirit pseudo-spiritual

1548
01:04:08,447 --> 01:04:10,239
No one ever get sick

1549
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:12,543
Leave that aside whenever you want to

1550
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:14,847
You can't you can't have both

1551
01:04:15,103 --> 01:04:16,127
Historically

1552
01:04:16,383 --> 01:04:17,919
The people who have reached enlightenment

1553
01:04:18,175 --> 01:04:19,711
Do not engage with be paranoid

1554
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:20,991
Train of lunacy

1555
01:04:21,247 --> 01:04:23,295
That's kind of one of the things that they put away

1556
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:25,855
What are the things that they shed from this

1557
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:27,903
Earthly body

1558
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:29,439
Spray

1559
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:30,207
So like it

1560
01:04:30,463 --> 01:04:30,975
It's just

1561
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:32,511
Not okay

1562
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:33,535
I think

1563
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:35,071
22

1564
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:36,607
To have such a scattered

1565
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:37,631
Disorder

1566
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:39,423
Disorienting

1567
01:04:39,935 --> 01:04:40,447
Contradict

1568
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:41,215
Victory

1569
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:41,983
Paranoid

1570
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:43,263
Conspiracy world

1571
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:45,055
You have to choose one

1572
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:46,079
And I'll let you do it

1573
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:47,359
I'll let you do it

1574
01:04:47,615 --> 01:04:48,639
I'll still make fun of

1575
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:49,407
Don't worry.

1576
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:52,735
Of course I don't have as much of a problem

1577
01:04:52,991 --> 01:04:53,759
With v

1578
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:54,527
Like

1579
01:04:55,295 --> 01:04:55,807
Hippie-ish

1580
01:04:57,087 --> 01:04:57,599
Love

1581
01:04:57,855 --> 01:05:03,999
Is a vibrational frequency we can all feel like

1582
01:05:04,255 --> 01:05:08,351
Animals

1583
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:12,191
You know the New World Order

1584
01:05:12,447 --> 01:05:12,959
Both

1585
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:17,823
It's not good peanut butter and chocolate it is more like

1586
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:19,359
Bananas and anything with pain

1587
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:21,919
Together

1588
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:27,039
Internally inconsistent and make me Furious

1589
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:29,087
But

1590
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:30,367
Kerry as a

1591
01:05:30,623 --> 01:05:31,647
The theory about Malibu

1592
01:05:31,903 --> 01:05:32,415
Your call

1593
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:33,695
There might be a beast

1594
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:34,719
Then that water

1595
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:36,511
Stand turns out

1596
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:40,863
Fix that

1597
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:42,399
She's been in you know

1598
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:43,423
Isolation

1599
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:45,727
Does she big TJ Miller fan

1600
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:46,751
TV

1601
01:05:47,007 --> 01:05:50,591
I started with kind of just letting people know that I was watching

1602
01:05:51,103 --> 01:05:53,407
Series on Amazon called

1603
01:05:53,663 --> 01:05:54,431
Invasion

1604
01:05:54,687 --> 01:05:56,991
And what I found was interesting

1605
01:05:57,247 --> 01:05:58,271
In that series there

1606
01:05:58,783 --> 01:05:59,295
It which is

1607
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:01,087
About an invasion that is

1608
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:04,159
Coming from the water and secretly

1609
01:06:04,415 --> 01:06:05,695
Taking over people

1610
01:06:07,487 --> 01:06:10,303
Appears to be something in some kind of

1611
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:12,095
Creature

1612
01:06:12,351 --> 01:06:13,375
But we don't really know

1613
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:14,143
What the creature

1614
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:15,679
Is although it

1615
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:17,215
It shows it at one point

1616
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:17,983
Looking

1617
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:18,751
Kind of

1618
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:20,799
Alien I guess and very weird

1619
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:22,335
And

1620
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:24,895
Basically they go into lockdown and curfew

1621
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:28,991
In part of the series in the beginning eventually that seems to be

1622
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:30,783
Taken up

1623
01:06:31,295 --> 01:06:32,063
As far as the

1624
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:33,599
Curfew goes and the lock

1625
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:34,367
Lockdown but

1626
01:06:35,647 --> 01:06:37,183
The Invasion continues

1627
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:38,719
So that's

1628
01:06:38,975 --> 01:06:41,279
That's kind of what you might say kind of a

1629
01:06:41,535 --> 01:06:42,047
A jumping-off

1630
01:06:42,815 --> 01:06:43,583
For me to talk

1631
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:44,351
Talk about the fact

1632
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:45,119
That thing's just

1633
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:48,703
Are you is it good though

1634
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:55,615
One I think it's hilarious that

1635
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:56,639
She'll sit down

1636
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:58,943
I'm going to watch the show

1637
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:03,039
And then find Invasion be like I'm going to do some research instead of watching a show

1638
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:04,063
I'm going to watch invasion

1639
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:08,159
You can't

1640
01:07:08,415 --> 01:07:10,463
Have an Amazon Prime account if you think that

1641
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:12,255
5G is coming to kill us all

1642
01:07:12,511 --> 01:07:14,047
You just can't do it

1643
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:15,327
Weird

1644
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:19,423
It's interesting that that also doesn't seem to be problems

1645
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:21,471
The thing that I want to draw a really

1646
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:22,239
So I can shower

1647
01:07:22,495 --> 01:07:23,775
Focus 2

1648
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:25,055
On the 7th

1649
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:27,103
On the report from Zach day

1650
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:33,503
She's speculating that there might be a beast coming out of the water in Malibu and the beaches are closed actually then on the 8th

1651
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:39,903
On that one to like well I have been watching the show called Invasion if there is possible that these are related thought

1652
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:40,927
I start on Monday

1653
01:07:41,439 --> 01:07:45,791
I thought there was a beast in the water on Tuesday and now I still take

1654
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:52,447
I don't think that there's any correlation relation

1655
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:53,215
To pick that

1656
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:59,615
Do I have a long endless track record of doing that

1657
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:00,895
Presenting his reality

1658
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:07,039
Is she enjoying the show

1659
01:08:07,807 --> 01:08:11,391
That's what I want

1660
01:08:11,903 --> 01:08:16,767
I want I don't want to be convinced of what the truth is so I won't watch it

1661
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:19,071
Something doesn't

1662
01:08:19,327 --> 01:08:20,095
Doesn't add up

1663
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:21,631
Or something it doesn't matter

1664
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:23,935
And

1665
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:26,495
Things just don't

1666
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:30,847
That there's no reason for one thing to keep people off

1667
01:08:31,103 --> 01:08:32,383
Trails out of parks and

1668
01:08:32,639 --> 01:08:33,407
Peaches

1669
01:08:33,919 --> 01:08:35,711
And an n

1670
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:38,015
This whole emphasis on 66

1671
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:38,783
Speedway

1672
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:41,599
Is actually very Ludacris and doesn't

1673
01:08:41,855 --> 01:08:42,623
Mean anything

1674
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:44,415
And

1675
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:45,695
Barry White

1676
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:47,743
Reason to believe it's not even

1677
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:51,071
It's not even contagious

1678
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:54,399
Okay really okay we're going there

1679
01:08:54,655 --> 01:08:57,215
Alright alright okay that's a big swing

1680
01:08:58,495 --> 01:08:59,007
Great

1681
01:08:59,263 --> 01:09:01,823
Hundred thousand people dying

1682
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:03,615
Contagious

1683
01:09:03,871 --> 01:09:06,175
Curious what cases

1684
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:07,199
I'm curious

1685
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:08,479
What's a treasonous

1686
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:10,783
Cuz I don't hear one

1687
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:12,831
I do hear her elaborate on this

1688
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:14,623
What's the reason for thinking this is

1689
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:17,951
Other than you not believing things are ever contagious

1690
01:09:18,207 --> 01:09:21,535
There's some reason to believe in

1691
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:27,935
Is it just because you didn't I that doesn't exist I don't have a reason I'm just saying that somewhere there is one probably right

1692
01:09:28,703 --> 01:09:29,727
Oh man

1693
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:33,823
That's so scary cats so scary

1694
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:34,847
Just spent

1695
01:09:35,103 --> 01:09:35,615
Again

1696
01:09:36,895 --> 01:09:37,407
Ruby

1697
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:39,711
Constantly reminded

1698
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:40,479
Two people

1699
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:45,087
Very easily becomes convinced

1700
01:09:45,343 --> 01:09:46,623
Cast of the exact same

1701
01:09:46,879 --> 01:09:48,159
Alex Jones believes

1702
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:48,927
Because they were

1703
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:49,695
Require

1704
01:09:49,951 --> 01:09:50,719
The same level of

1705
01:09:50,975 --> 01:09:51,999
Disconnect from reality

1706
01:09:52,511 --> 01:09:54,047
Start teaching germ theory in like

1707
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:55,071
Kindergarten

1708
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:57,119
Just to make sure that this is that this

1709
01:09:57,375 --> 01:09:57,887
Kind of thought does

1710
01:09:58,143 --> 01:09:58,655
Doesn't happen

1711
01:09:58,911 --> 01:10:00,447
Open as an adult like we really got

1712
01:10:00,703 --> 01:10:01,215
Hammer it home

1713
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:02,495
At the at the

1714
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:03,519
Point of birth

1715
01:10:03,775 --> 01:10:06,079
I'm not I'm not sure I think that's treating a symptom

1716
01:10:06,591 --> 01:10:12,735
I think that's treating a symptom as opposed to the larger problem that is

1717
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:14,527
Denial of reality

1718
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:16,063
I think that you

1719
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:17,599
Instill reality well

1720
01:10:18,111 --> 01:10:19,903
And people will go ahead and

1721
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:21,439
Figure out the deer germ Park

1722
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:22,975
Sure sure

1723
01:10:23,743 --> 01:10:24,255
Oh man

1724
01:10:25,023 --> 01:10:28,607
I do appreciate on one level

1725
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:29,887
Unlike Alex

1726
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:34,495
Then I will shoot Shield name people who are silenced the tube laser X

1727
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:35,775
Appreciate

1728
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:39,871
Another thing that I appreciate is that she will just kind of cop to the fact

1729
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:40,639
Fit like

1730
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:44,479
I think life is a movie

1731
01:10:44,735 --> 01:10:45,759
Just be making stuff up

1732
01:10:46,015 --> 01:10:47,039
What I'm doing is

1733
01:10:47,295 --> 01:10:49,343
Taking sort of a jump-off

1734
01:10:49,599 --> 01:10:50,623
If you want to call it

1735
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:52,159
And

1736
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:53,951
Really just connecting some.

1737
01:10:54,207 --> 01:10:54,975
And giving you a

1738
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:56,255
Hypothetical

1739
01:10:56,767 --> 01:10:58,047
Look at what might

1740
01:10:58,303 --> 01:11:01,119
Be going on

1741
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:02,143
Outrageous

1742
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:03,679
And maybe off

1743
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:08,031
But there are some interesting things going on

1744
01:11:08,287 --> 01:11:09,567
And because I see the

1745
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:13,151
That you know I see I tend to see life like a Hollywood movie

1746
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:16,735
Cuz I'm a screenwriter

1747
01:11:17,247 --> 01:11:18,783
Did I write screen rides

1748
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:19,807
Speed into

1749
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:21,087
To my kind of

1750
01:11:21,599 --> 01:11:22,623
Conception of that

1751
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:23,903
Yes it does

1752
01:11:24,415 --> 01:11:25,951
Maybe and maybe in a way that's a

1753
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:26,975
Problem

1754
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:33,375
Declarative statements about what's happening

1755
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:34,655
Christian funny

1756
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:38,239
Somehow

1757
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:42,335
It makes me even angrier that she's willing to admit she's just making

1758
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:43,615
Step up like she's not

1759
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:47,967
She's not like Alex saying he's right 100% of the time even when he's wrong but she's like

1760
01:11:48,223 --> 01:11:50,271
I'm putting some guys together maybe it's stupid

1761
01:11:50,783 --> 01:11:53,599
To be clear she's not saying that about everything

1762
01:11:53,855 --> 01:11:57,439
She saying that about specifically The Narrative we're going to get to the end of this up

1763
01:11:57,695 --> 01:11:58,975
So

1764
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:00,511
I do admit she's making

1765
01:12:01,023 --> 01:12:03,583
Okay but she also is not

1766
01:12:03,839 --> 01:12:04,351
Presenting

1767
01:12:04,607 --> 01:12:05,119
Get that way

1768
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:07,167
She's not presenting it as like

1769
01:12:07,935 --> 01:12:08,703
I just

1770
01:12:08,959 --> 01:12:09,983
To give you a spoiler

1771
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:11,519
She's talkin about something

1772
01:12:11,775 --> 01:12:12,543
Completely insane

1773
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:14,335
Event is at the end of the

1774
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:16,895
This is the most likely explanation

1775
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:24,575
You cut that sincerely true but it's the most likely could say it

1776
01:12:24,831 --> 01:12:29,183
Hayward

1777
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:36,095
And it doesn't apply to other things like her using this

1778
01:12:36,351 --> 01:12:37,631
Play doctor

1779
01:12:38,143 --> 01:12:39,679
Germs don't exist

1780
01:12:39,935 --> 01:12:41,471
When people get sick

1781
01:12:41,727 --> 01:12:43,519
Because a member of the family is sick

1782
01:12:43,775 --> 01:12:45,311
If this is a sympathy

1783
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:46,079
Ascetic

1784
01:12:46,335 --> 01:12:47,615
Fonts in my view

1785
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:48,383
It's not

1786
01:12:48,639 --> 01:12:49,151
Because

1787
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:50,431
You know literally

1788
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:52,223
What we called germs or

1789
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:53,247
Bacteria

1790
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:54,015
Where

1791
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:55,039
Picked up

1792
01:12:56,319 --> 01:12:56,831
That's

1793
01:12:57,087 --> 01:12:59,647
You know now I have Doctor Young who would

1794
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:00,927
Sanchez.

1795
01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:01,695
As

1796
01:13:01,951 --> 01:13:02,975
As well

1797
01:13:03,231 --> 01:13:03,743
He what

1798
01:13:03,999 --> 01:13:05,023
I've interviewed and

1799
01:13:05,535 --> 01:13:07,327
The links are on my website

1800
01:13:08,607 --> 01:13:09,375
But on top of it

1801
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:10,143
There is

1802
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:11,679
Simply

1803
01:13:12,447 --> 01:13:17,055
No real basis for understanding what those things are

1804
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:18,591
As opposed to

1805
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:21,151
Why we would bring them into our body

1806
01:13:21,407 --> 01:13:22,687
1st place and

1807
01:13:22,943 --> 01:13:23,967
Gotten into this another

1808
01:13:24,223 --> 01:13:25,503
Think other videos

1809
01:13:25,759 --> 01:13:28,063
So I really don't want to repeat myself

1810
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:29,599
I don't want to get into it

1811
01:13:29,855 --> 01:13:32,415
Wow wow

1812
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:38,047
Look I won't bore you with the Gory details of all the stuff that I don't know anything about

1813
01:13:38,303 --> 01:13:40,607
I'm just going to let you know that I proved

1814
01:13:40,863 --> 01:13:47,007
Science is wrong and I'm right by felon friend

1815
01:13:47,519 --> 01:13:48,287
Yeah you know

1816
01:13:48,543 --> 01:13:51,615
Does she just go through like local newspapers to see who what

1817
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:58,015
Fake doctor might have gone to jail and then she just visits them in jail and that's how she gets all of her sources guessing it's just whoever

1818
01:13:58,271 --> 01:14:01,855
Believes in Bleach

1819
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:05,439
Anyway Kerry Hudson dreams

1820
01:14:05,695 --> 01:14:07,999
Prophetic dream sharp course

1821
01:14:08,767 --> 01:14:09,535
The question is

1822
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:10,559
Should be we be watch

1823
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:11,327
Watching the skies

1824
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:15,423
And there is reason to believe that there's an asteroid headed towards us

1825
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:17,215
I did have a vision of this

1826
01:14:17,471 --> 01:14:19,007
And then it came out in the news

1827
01:14:19,519 --> 01:14:20,799
After I had my vision

1828
01:14:21,311 --> 01:14:22,079
About

1829
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:24,127
I don't know week later and

1830
01:14:24,895 --> 01:14:26,687
What's happening now is there's more more

1831
01:14:26,943 --> 01:14:27,711
Bartok of this

1832
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:29,503
But you have to realize

1833
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:32,319
For I suggest you realize that

1834
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:35,903
We actually have the Weaponry to shoot down

1835
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:36,927
Shoot away

1836
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:44,351
Ion asteroid as well

1837
01:14:46,911 --> 01:14:47,679
It's on Prime music

1838
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:53,823
Jstor account that is Amazon Prime

1839
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:57,151
I mean yeah whatever man

1840
01:14:57,407 --> 01:14:58,943
Division of an asteroid

1841
01:14:59,199 --> 01:14:59,711
I don't care

1842
01:15:00,735 --> 01:15:04,319
Maybe and then she'd be like now it's not Armageddon that's stupid

1843
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:05,343
Is Deep Impact

1844
01:15:05,599 --> 01:15:06,111
That's way better

1845
01:15:06,367 --> 01:15:07,135
Pardon my take

1846
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:08,927
So here we go

1847
01:15:09,183 --> 01:15:15,071
I want it I would talk about her visions and how I don't care about being a source of information

1848
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:15,839
But I can't be

1849
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:17,631
Because we got to get that a business on

1850
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:18,399
This

1851
01:15:18,655 --> 01:15:19,167
Fun

1852
01:15:19,423 --> 01:15:20,447
I'm so

1853
01:15:20,703 --> 01:15:21,215
So

1854
01:15:21,983 --> 01:15:22,751
There is a problem

1855
01:15:23,263 --> 01:15:23,775
And that is

1856
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:25,055
In China

1857
01:15:25,311 --> 01:15:27,871
There were stories that came out about people being welded into their home

1858
01:15:28,383 --> 01:15:29,663
Quarantine sure now

1859
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:31,199
Some people might think

1860
01:15:31,455 --> 01:15:33,503
Is the act of an authoritarian government

1861
01:15:33,759 --> 01:15:34,783
Trying to contain

1862
01:15:35,295 --> 01:15:36,063
Osiris

1863
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:37,599
Sounds like what they would do

1864
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:41,695
An extreme example

1865
01:15:41,951 --> 01:15:42,975
What I would believe

1866
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:44,255
A government like

1867
01:15:44,511 --> 01:15:45,535
The Chinese government

1868
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:46,815
I do

1869
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:49,887
Now there's another explanation that's possible

1870
01:15:50,655 --> 01:15:52,447
The question becomes why would you weld

1871
01:15:52,703 --> 01:15:53,471
People into their

1872
01:15:53,727 --> 01:15:54,239
Hartman

1873
01:15:55,263 --> 01:15:56,031
And that

1874
01:15:56,287 --> 01:15:58,591
Comes into a sort of almost Syfy

1875
01:15:59,615 --> 01:16:02,175
Idea and this is where it gets

1876
01:16:02,431 --> 01:16:04,991
We have to go back and look at what the viruses so

1877
01:16:05,503 --> 01:16:06,271
They say the

1878
01:16:06,783 --> 01:16:07,551
That

1879
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:10,367
Most of the information coming through

1880
01:16:10,879 --> 01:16:11,903
How to do with the

1881
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:13,439
40 track

1882
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:14,207
And then

1883
01:16:14,463 --> 01:16:15,231
Allowed

1884
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:15,999
A pin

1885
01:16:16,255 --> 01:16:17,535
Bioweapons lab in North

1886
01:16:17,791 --> 01:16:18,303
Carolina

1887
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:21,375
Making its way to Wuhan

1888
01:16:22,143 --> 01:16:23,935
I am a Chinese woman

1889
01:16:24,703 --> 01:16:25,727
Who was working

1890
01:16:25,983 --> 01:16:27,007
For the u.s.

1891
01:16:27,519 --> 01:16:28,031
A

1892
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:30,079
I also being involved in that

1893
01:16:30,591 --> 01:16:31,103
And maybe

1894
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:32,127
Even

1895
01:16:32,639 --> 01:16:34,943
Involved in the transfer over to China

1896
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:38,783
Does appear that China and the USA were working simultaneously

1897
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:39,807
On this

1898
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:40,831
Nuclear

1899
01:16:41,599 --> 01:16:42,367
Virus type

1900
01:16:42,623 --> 01:16:43,903
Thing and that they were getting

1901
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:46,463
Something from bats

1902
01:16:46,975 --> 01:16:49,023
There's something going on with that

1903
01:16:49,535 --> 01:16:50,815
Some going on with bats

1904
01:16:51,071 --> 01:16:53,631
Not quite sure exactly what's going on here

1905
01:16:54,143 --> 01:16:54,655
His next class

1906
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:56,191
As

1907
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:57,471
To use her own

1908
01:16:57,727 --> 01:16:58,495
Goes right off of

1909
01:16:58,751 --> 01:16:59,263
Okay

1910
01:16:59,519 --> 01:17:01,823
But it also you also have to save yourself

1911
01:17:02,335 --> 01:17:04,383
Okay why would somebody

1912
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:09,247
Wanted lock these people in unless there were developing symptoms

1913
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:13,599
That are similar to some kind of a vampire

1914
01:17:13,855 --> 01:17:14,367
React

1915
01:17:15,903 --> 01:17:16,671
Results

1916
01:17:18,463 --> 01:17:21,791
And that this was what they were afraid of or

1917
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:23,839
Well the mints

1918
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:31,007
Of course the possible explanation

1919
01:17:31,263 --> 01:17:33,055
Parties out here you got a welder

1920
01:17:35,615 --> 01:17:37,407
That was Van helsing's first idea

1921
01:17:37,663 --> 01:17:38,431
Wilderman

1922
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:40,991
Welder into that f****** Castle

1923
01:17:41,247 --> 01:17:42,271
Now what the stock market

1924
01:17:42,527 --> 01:17:44,575
What Dad did you notice the state

1925
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:46,623
Wake up the steak business

1926
01:17:46,879 --> 01:17:50,207
Did you know that

1927
01:17:50,463 --> 01:17:50,975
Look at

1928
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:52,511
Who look at the numbers

1929
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:55,583
They're making vampires

1930
01:17:55,839 --> 01:17:58,655
And now here we are

1931
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:04,287
They got taken stuff from bats

1932
01:18:04,543 --> 01:18:10,687
I did not we got vampires can't believe that you didn't get that when she said they were taking something from back I was so worried

1933
01:18:13,247 --> 01:18:15,551
Vampires are real

1934
01:18:16,063 --> 01:18:17,855
I thought for sure you'd be like oh she's

1935
01:18:19,903 --> 01:18:25,279
I I didn't think anybody with an Amazon Prime account would go straight to vampires and I was wrong I was just

1936
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:31,935
Play to turn people into vampires

1937
01:18:32,191 --> 01:18:33,983
Strakos whatever

1938
01:18:34,495 --> 01:18:36,287
Also probably has to do

1939
01:18:36,543 --> 01:18:40,127
That nefarious race of aliens that pops up every now and again

1940
01:18:40,639 --> 01:18:42,175
The dragon moth out no

1941
01:18:42,943 --> 01:18:44,223
That's our blood draw

1942
01:18:48,575 --> 01:18:50,367
Basically the DNA

1943
01:18:50,623 --> 01:18:52,415
Coming from batch that would be involved

1944
01:18:52,671 --> 01:18:53,183
Open whatever

1945
01:18:54,207 --> 01:18:55,487
They took four from them

1946
01:18:55,743 --> 01:18:56,511
Presumably

1947
01:18:57,023 --> 01:19:00,351
And something that is known in the Asiana Dean material

1948
01:19:00,863 --> 01:19:02,143
About a very

1949
01:19:02,399 --> 01:19:04,959
Very diabolical alien creature that

1950
01:19:05,727 --> 01:19:08,287
Said to be more diabolical than just the straight-up

1951
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:09,055
Draco

1952
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:11,615
Courts know we have the grace

1953
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:13,663
The reptilians and the Draco

1954
01:19:13,919 --> 01:19:14,431
Kind of in a pack

1955
01:19:15,711 --> 01:19:16,223
And

1956
01:19:16,735 --> 01:19:18,271
Glassmaking going

1957
01:19:18,783 --> 01:19:19,551
At Westside

1958
01:19:19,807 --> 01:19:21,343
Various governments and also with

1959
01:19:22,879 --> 01:19:23,391
With with

1960
01:19:23,647 --> 01:19:24,159
Especially with

1961
01:19:25,183 --> 01:19:28,255
And so it's very important to understand that this

1962
01:19:28,767 --> 01:19:31,071
This sort of New World Order is coming

1963
01:19:31,327 --> 01:19:32,351
From that group

1964
01:19:32,863 --> 01:19:34,143
Which is at a very

1965
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:35,167
Got top down

1966
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:36,191
Hierarchy

1967
01:19:36,447 --> 01:19:37,471
Call Society

1968
01:19:37,983 --> 01:19:38,751
That they purr

1969
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:40,031
Prefer humans to

1970
01:19:40,287 --> 01:19:41,311
Basically be

1971
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:43,359
Following in that

1972
01:19:43,615 --> 01:19:44,639
That tradition

1973
01:19:45,151 --> 01:19:47,455
The humans they weren't allowed to live that is

1974
01:19:47,711 --> 01:19:48,223
And

1975
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:49,247
They are

1976
01:19:50,015 --> 01:19:52,319
Still in a takeover scenario and one

1977
01:19:52,575 --> 01:19:53,087
Topeka

1978
01:19:53,343 --> 01:19:54,111
Complete control

1979
01:19:54,367 --> 01:19:55,135
But there's another group

1980
01:19:55,647 --> 01:19:56,671
Call the dragon mod

1981
01:19:57,439 --> 01:19:58,463
That apparently

1982
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:00,255
Might be related to the dryer

1983
01:20:00,767 --> 01:20:02,047
The dragons but they're

1984
01:20:02,303 --> 01:20:02,815
A whole step

1985
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:04,351
Aside which app

1986
01:20:04,607 --> 01:20:05,119
Appears to be

1987
01:20:05,631 --> 01:20:08,959
This is just my conjecture I can't remember what their actual

1988
01:20:09,727 --> 01:20:11,263
Combination is there

1989
01:20:11,775 --> 01:20:12,799
If they appear to be

1990
01:20:13,567 --> 01:20:15,104
Yeah you can say instead

1991
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:16,128
Aptoide dragon

1992
01:20:16,384 --> 01:20:18,176
Dragon so there's some dragon

1993
01:20:18,432 --> 01:20:19,200
Insectoid

1994
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:19,968
Creature

1995
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:23,040
And even related possibly to the burg

1996
01:20:24,064 --> 01:20:24,832
Like a dragonfly

1997
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:26,112
Exedra

1998
01:20:26,624 --> 01:20:27,136
So

1999
01:20:27,392 --> 01:20:28,672
And it's well-known the birds

2000
01:20:28,928 --> 01:20:29,440
Pixar

2001
01:20:29,952 --> 01:20:30,976
Related to Dorothy

2002
01:20:32,256 --> 01:20:34,304
Draco Andretti

2003
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:35,072
As a species

2004
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:36,096
So

2005
01:20:36,352 --> 01:20:37,376
You get the connection

2006
01:20:37,888 --> 01:20:39,936
Are you getting Burger in on it too.

2007
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:41,472
It makes sense

2008
01:20:41,984 --> 01:20:44,288
Words related

2009
01:20:44,544 --> 01:20:49,152
To the Raptors that evolved into alien

2010
01:20:49,408 --> 01:20:50,688
And reptiles isn't there

2011
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:51,968
Kind of a difference

2012
01:20:52,224 --> 01:20:55,808
Path isn't a branching path branching pathways

2013
01:20:56,064 --> 01:21:02,208
Could say that they have a common ancestor prior to the Raptors escaping the

2014
01:21:02,464 --> 01:21:04,256
Extinction of all life on Earth

2015
01:21:04,512 --> 01:21:07,840
Probably at the burden they are those wings Birds

2016
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:10,656
The way she's talking about

2017
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:18,336
I don't have a lot of faith in this

2018
01:21:20,896 --> 01:21:25,504
Do your f****** research on your fake bulshit at least I need

2019
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:31,904
Pull on entry in the

2020
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:37,536
In the dragons manual for your boat

2021
01:21:39,072 --> 01:21:39,840
Dragon Mods

2022
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:40,864
Baby birds

2023
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:41,632
Wings

2024
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:43,168
Insectoid

2025
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:44,704
Little bit

2026
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:45,728
Nefarious

2027
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:49,568
Very diabolical diabolical

2028
01:21:50,592 --> 01:21:51,360
Explain to me how

2029
01:21:52,384 --> 01:21:55,200
What grit dacian of diabolical

2030
01:21:55,712 --> 01:22:01,088
Are we dealing with whatever we're talkin to even more diabolical than the ones trying to enslave an entire planet

2031
01:22:02,368 --> 01:22:02,880
I don't know

2032
01:22:03,136 --> 01:22:04,416
Also I don't understand how

2033
01:22:04,672 --> 01:22:05,696
Maternity Ward vampires

2034
01:22:05,952 --> 01:22:06,464
Scworks

2035
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:07,488
Put those goals

2036
01:22:07,744 --> 01:22:09,792
A bit from Vampire Lord

2037
01:22:10,048 --> 01:22:15,680
Immortal

2038
01:22:15,936 --> 01:22:18,240
Standard vampire powers are we dealing with here

2039
01:22:18,496 --> 01:22:20,544
Okay so the Chinese in USA government

2040
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:22,336
Both turn people into vampires

2041
01:22:26,432 --> 01:22:28,480
Because

2042
01:22:29,504 --> 01:22:30,528
As we all know vampires

2043
01:22:30,784 --> 01:22:31,552
Can I get

2044
01:22:32,064 --> 01:22:38,208
It is simply impossible for them to turn into some sort of smaller creature that could literally Fly Away

2045
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:41,024
Outside

2046
01:22:42,304 --> 01:22:46,400
There's no something was up Iris and don't give you capes

2047
01:22:47,424 --> 01:22:48,704
Widow's peak attic

2048
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:55,104
Dead ringer you are a vampire

2049
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:56,128
Building to get treatment

2050
01:22:56,384 --> 01:22:58,688
And came out Hungarian which is really strange

2051
01:22:58,944 --> 01:23:00,736
That was really strange for me

2052
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:03,808
I don't know man

2053
01:23:04,064 --> 01:23:06,368
I guess you weld them in so they can't

2054
01:23:06,624 --> 01:23:10,208
Sherry

2055
01:23:10,464 --> 01:23:11,744
Easier

2056
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:17,888
Especially if they're not like good at being a vampire yet

2057
01:23:18,144 --> 01:23:18,656
Mentor

2058
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:22,496
A vampire Mentor so I assume that the dragon Bots have been make

2059
01:23:22,752 --> 01:23:23,776
Can vampires for a long

2060
01:23:24,288 --> 01:23:24,800
Right

2061
01:23:25,824 --> 01:23:29,664
I mean the only goal of this would be to spread vampirism

2062
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:33,248
I mean I would be to make everyone vampires

2063
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:36,064
I was a vampire that doesn't seem so bad

2064
01:23:36,576 --> 01:23:37,088
I mean

2065
01:23:37,856 --> 01:23:38,880
Yeah

2066
01:23:39,136 --> 01:23:39,648
Require

2067
01:23:39,904 --> 01:23:44,256
Fundamental restructuring of society

2068
01:23:44,768 --> 01:23:50,144
Public transit would not be an issue anymore that's it that's a positive we're not talking about that all right

2069
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:53,984
Get down to it on like a kind of a basis shooter

2070
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:58,336
Healthcare cost to go down

2071
01:23:58,848 --> 01:24:02,688
Snow certainly blood banks iPhone reproduce

2072
01:24:03,968 --> 01:24:05,504
Other than by a vampire

2073
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:06,784
B Brian

2074
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:07,552
I don't think you can

2075
01:24:07,808 --> 01:24:09,344
I don't have time

2076
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:10,368
Yeah yeah yeah

2077
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:11,904
I don't think they're

2078
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:13,184
Packing a good sperm count

2079
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:14,208
My other problem

2080
01:24:14,464 --> 01:24:16,000
Is that if you're trying to

2081
01:24:16,256 --> 01:24:18,560
Create a subservient population

2082
01:24:18,816 --> 01:24:19,328
Don't go vampire

2083
01:24:20,096 --> 01:24:22,656
There are historically in literature

2084
01:24:22,912 --> 01:24:23,936
Rebellious

2085
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:27,008
Absolutely

2086
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:29,568
The social order bus

2087
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:33,920
Because of how much chaos they bring into a system

2088
01:24:34,432 --> 01:24:39,296
Also there but that's what maybe that's what the Diabolical Dragon boss are trying to do to the dracos

2089
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:40,320
Attempt

2090
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:46,720
To bring an order across purposes of the Draco.

2091
01:24:46,976 --> 01:24:48,000
Believer

2092
01:24:48,256 --> 01:24:50,816
Vampires at the Dragon

2093
01:24:51,584 --> 01:24:56,192
Especially considering if I understand Mi or correctly

2094
01:24:56,448 --> 01:24:59,520
Vampires are just a thinly veiled anti-immigrant message

2095
01:24:59,776 --> 01:25:01,824
There's also like

2096
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:04,896
A sexuality thing to it

2097
01:25:05,152 --> 01:25:11,040
Again it's a fear of the sexuality of the other European coming into

2098
01:25:11,296 --> 01:25:12,576
Europe in order to

2099
01:25:12,832 --> 01:25:17,696
Have sex with all of our women and our cultures and steal everything about Mars

2100
01:25:18,208 --> 01:25:20,000
As well as our economy like there's

2101
01:25:20,512 --> 01:25:24,352
It's a really really racist book if you get down to it

2102
01:25:24,608 --> 01:25:30,496
About the vampire law passed that makes sense as something

2103
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:32,544
Abusing in your dump

2104
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:40,480
We have a baby

2105
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:43,552
Wildeman

2106
01:25:44,064 --> 01:25:46,624
It's really important to recognize this

2107
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:48,416
That like she's in the middle of

2108
01:25:48,672 --> 01:25:49,440
I'm talking about

2109
01:25:49,696 --> 01:25:55,840
Dragon Ball is on probably create

2110
01:25:56,096 --> 01:25:57,120
Dating vampires

2111
01:25:57,376 --> 01:26:00,192
And then interspersed with that is stuff like this

2112
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:02,752
Falcon who's running this whole show

2113
01:26:03,008 --> 01:26:04,032
It appears

2114
01:26:04,288 --> 01:26:04,800
Ephraim

2115
01:26:05,056 --> 01:26:07,360
The side of the medical side related

2116
01:26:07,616 --> 01:26:08,384
To the CDC

2117
01:26:08,896 --> 01:26:11,200
Is yuno on stage with Trump

2118
01:26:11,712 --> 01:26:12,736
All the time

2119
01:26:14,016 --> 01:26:15,808
Although there is indications that

2120
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:19,136
Trump is very likely going to fire him very soon

2121
01:26:19,392 --> 01:26:20,416
Now he's a vampire

2122
01:26:20,928 --> 01:26:22,208
But he's a very diable

2123
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:23,232
Follicle care

2124
01:26:23,488 --> 01:26:25,280
Durand it does appear that this was

2125
01:26:25,536 --> 01:26:26,048
What's the plan

2126
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:27,840
So he's orchestrating

2127
01:26:28,352 --> 01:26:29,376
In some ways

2128
01:26:29,632 --> 01:26:32,448
A lot of what's going on here especially in the United States

2129
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:35,008
And advocating all of the Bill Gates and you

2130
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:36,544
He's basically in bed with

2131
01:26:37,312 --> 01:26:38,336
The gates and all that

2132
01:26:39,872 --> 01:26:42,432
This is what we have of you know it's a very

2133
01:26:42,688 --> 01:26:43,200
Diabhal

2134
01:26:43,712 --> 01:26:47,296
Concoction obviously keeps

2135
01:26:47,552 --> 01:26:49,088
So you have this

2136
01:26:49,344 --> 01:26:53,184
This presentation of maybe this viruses aliens tribe

2137
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:54,464
Scrape vampires

2138
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:57,280
At the same time

2139
01:26:57,536 --> 01:27:03,424
Very much Alex Jones theories about real-life things like being in bed with Bill Gates

2140
01:27:03,936 --> 01:27:06,496
Play Thursday real world version of that which is

2141
01:27:06,752 --> 01:27:08,288
Yes he works at the NIH

2142
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:11,872
Forks of the year of allergy and infectious diseases

2143
01:27:12,128 --> 01:27:12,640
Bill Gates

2144
01:27:12,896 --> 01:27:15,200
S550 has to do with infectious diseases

2145
01:27:15,456 --> 01:27:15,968
Why

2146
01:27:16,224 --> 01:27:18,016
They be in some sort of

2147
01:27:18,272 --> 01:27:21,344
Association with each other

2148
01:27:21,856 --> 01:27:26,464
Whatever

2149
01:27:27,232 --> 01:27:30,560
It's something you can convince yourself of if you do such bad

2150
01:27:30,816 --> 01:27:32,096
Game that you believe

2151
01:27:32,352 --> 01:27:33,632
Maybe this virus

2152
01:27:33,888 --> 01:27:34,912
Is vampires

2153
01:27:36,704 --> 01:27:37,984
You have to be asking yourself at this

2154
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:40,032
The game here

2155
01:27:40,544 --> 01:27:41,568
Why you trying to make vampires

2156
01:27:41,824 --> 01:27:44,384
Because we can't figure this out I was asking myself

2157
01:27:44,896 --> 01:27:45,920
Doesn't make sense now

2158
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:48,224
This is convoluted

2159
01:27:48,736 --> 01:27:50,528
Does have an answer

2160
01:27:52,832 --> 01:27:53,856
This was

2161
01:27:54,112 --> 01:27:55,648
Do you know I said earlier

2162
01:27:56,672 --> 01:27:58,464
Aspiring to make lasagna is a bright spot

2163
01:27:59,232 --> 01:28:00,000
That's just because I

2164
01:28:00,256 --> 01:28:01,792
Couldn't tell you about this clip in advance

2165
01:28:02,304 --> 01:28:03,328
The clip was a bit of a bright spot

2166
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:04,608
So you have

2167
01:28:04,864 --> 01:28:06,144
Have to also then look at

2168
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:08,192
What trumps doing so Trump is

2169
01:28:08,448 --> 01:28:10,496
Hunting down blood Drinkers and Peta

2170
01:28:13,568 --> 01:28:14,592
Adrenochrome

2171
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:15,872
Attics

2172
01:28:16,128 --> 01:28:16,640
Sarah speak

2173
01:28:16,896 --> 01:28:19,200
Who are all related to the Draco and

2174
01:28:19,456 --> 01:28:20,480
Killian's and greys

2175
01:28:21,504 --> 01:28:22,016
And

2176
01:28:22,272 --> 01:28:25,600
Presumably goes into the dragonballs who are

2177
01:28:26,624 --> 01:28:27,136
I'm sure

2178
01:28:27,904 --> 01:28:28,928
Equally as diabolic

2179
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:30,208
Local and said to be worse

2180
01:28:30,464 --> 01:28:30,976
Actually

2181
01:28:31,232 --> 01:28:32,256
So we're talking about

2182
01:28:32,768 --> 01:28:33,280
Beings that

2183
01:28:33,536 --> 01:28:34,560
Feed on human

2184
01:28:34,816 --> 01:28:37,376
And humans getting shot up

2185
01:28:37,632 --> 01:28:38,144
With

2186
01:28:39,424 --> 01:28:40,704
Type of a virus

2187
01:28:41,472 --> 01:28:41,984
That

2188
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:43,264
Is going to

2189
01:28:44,032 --> 01:28:45,056
Possibly shoot.

2190
01:28:45,312 --> 01:28:46,592
DNA into

2191
01:28:46,848 --> 01:28:47,360
Human

2192
01:28:47,872 --> 01:28:49,408
Turning them into

2193
01:28:49,664 --> 01:28:50,432
In theory

2194
01:28:51,456 --> 01:28:52,480
Blood drinkers

2195
01:28:52,992 --> 01:28:53,504
Themselves

2196
01:28:54,272 --> 01:28:54,784
And

2197
01:28:55,296 --> 01:28:56,064
In Mass

2198
01:28:56,320 --> 01:29:01,184
And this is the kind of thing where if he were an Illuminati and you realize you were being hunt

2199
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:04,512
Two down especially your leaders are being hunted down

2200
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:07,584
Then of course you want safety and numbers

2201
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:09,120
You want somewhere to hide

2202
01:29:09,376 --> 01:29:10,656
You have nowhere to hide

2203
01:29:10,912 --> 01:29:11,424
And

2204
01:29:11,936 --> 01:29:13,984
The way these people think they would be

2205
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:15,520
Diabolical enough

2206
01:29:15,776 --> 01:29:16,544
21A create

2207
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:20,384
A basically a

2208
01:29:20,896 --> 01:29:24,224
Turn humans into vampires the more you have in your on your team

2209
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:25,504
The Morrie

2210
01:29:26,016 --> 01:29:27,296
How are you have and

2211
01:29:27,808 --> 01:29:29,088
Possibly to come back

2212
01:29:30,112 --> 01:29:32,672
This the loss of some of your leaders

2213
01:29:33,696 --> 01:29:34,208
And

2214
01:29:34,464 --> 01:29:36,000
By creating a hole

2215
01:29:36,256 --> 01:29:37,536
Species that would

2216
01:29:38,048 --> 01:29:40,864
Bass is basically have a similar lifestyle

2217
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:41,888
And taste

2218
01:29:43,424 --> 01:29:44,960
To what you do so

2219
01:29:45,216 --> 01:29:45,984
This is

2220
01:29:47,008 --> 01:29:48,800
Unbelievable stuff I know

2221
01:29:49,312 --> 01:29:50,080
And it does sound

2222
01:29:50,336 --> 01:29:51,104
Crazy

2223
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:52,128
But this

2224
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:53,920
Is very likely

2225
01:29:54,176 --> 01:29:54,944
What's going on

2226
01:29:56,224 --> 01:29:57,248
This is what's going on

2227
01:29:58,272 --> 01:29:58,784
I want

2228
01:29:59,040 --> 01:29:59,808
I want to laugh

2229
01:30:00,064 --> 01:30:02,880
Brain

2230
01:30:03,136 --> 01:30:03,904
Brain

2231
01:30:04,672 --> 01:30:09,280
So Trump

2232
01:30:09,536 --> 01:30:13,376
Alex among among the population

2233
01:30:13,632 --> 01:30:17,728
So in order to create more vampires

2234
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:19,776
Do do this virus

2235
01:30:20,032 --> 01:30:21,056
The creates vampires

2236
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:22,848
In order to get

2237
01:30:23,104 --> 01:30:23,616
New recruit

2238
01:30:23,872 --> 01:30:25,152
Store

2239
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:27,712
Here's my biggest

2240
01:30:28,224 --> 01:30:30,784
What I'm hearing is that there are no vampire powers that

2241
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:31,552
Come along with this

2242
01:30:31,808 --> 01:30:33,088
You just like to drink blood

2243
01:30:33,344 --> 01:30:34,112
But also

2244
01:30:34,624 --> 01:30:35,648
So they're like

2245
01:30:35,904 --> 01:30:37,696
Jesus man we drink all of his blood

2246
01:30:37,952 --> 01:30:39,744
Down

2247
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:43,072
So what we're going to do is we're going to make other people who drink blood

2248
01:30:43,328 --> 01:30:45,120
And then we're all going to get into a big circle

2249
01:30:45,376 --> 01:30:51,520
And they're going to be like all we got to stop you it's like there's too many of us.

2250
01:30:52,288 --> 01:30:53,056
I don't have to be powers

2251
01:30:54,336 --> 01:30:56,128
It's ludicrous to do this without having

2252
01:30:56,640 --> 01:31:00,480
I mean not not to everybody but I mean to have this story

2253
01:31:00,992 --> 01:31:02,528
Without powers

2254
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:03,552
Believer

2255
01:31:03,808 --> 01:31:07,136
She said the X-Men was real or powers

2256
01:31:07,392 --> 01:31:08,416
It's just like

2257
01:31:08,672 --> 01:31:10,464
She's not giving me any powers

2258
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:14,816
She's not giving me any clear-cut powers all I'm hearing is that the globalist

2259
01:31:15,328 --> 01:31:16,864
Are making people

2260
01:31:17,376 --> 01:31:23,520
What to drink blood and then they're going to be malnourished

2261
01:31:24,544 --> 01:31:26,080
What's drink blood leaves the address

2262
01:31:27,872 --> 01:31:29,408
This is not really that far off

2263
01:31:29,664 --> 01:31:30,944
Is this the cheese

2264
01:31:31,712 --> 01:31:37,856
Aliens involved in that coronavirus is making people at the

2265
01:31:38,368 --> 01:31:39,648
Do I got to lock them in the house

2266
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:46,048
I don't I don't know about all of it is

2267
01:31:46,304 --> 01:31:46,816
It's just like

2268
01:31:47,072 --> 01:31:50,912
Stupid cuz once you start talking about that like what about all the other stuff

2269
01:31:51,168 --> 01:31:53,472
Like you I seen George Soros out

2270
01:31:53,984 --> 01:31:57,824
Did during the day yeah I know that's just from book

2271
01:32:00,128 --> 01:32:03,200
The game's not worth playing

2272
01:32:03,456 --> 01:32:07,296
We're in the moment in every vampire movie where they're like

2273
01:32:07,808 --> 01:32:10,880
Now throw about it throw away everything you've heard about vampires and

2274
01:32:11,136 --> 01:32:12,160
Books and movies

2275
01:32:12,416 --> 01:32:15,488
These are the real vampires and s*** like that

2276
01:32:17,024 --> 01:32:17,536
Also

2277
01:32:18,304 --> 01:32:19,584
The Illuminati

2278
01:32:20,096 --> 01:32:21,888
Does not need to turn people into

2279
01:32:22,144 --> 01:32:23,168
Blood drinkers to make

2280
01:32:23,424 --> 01:32:25,216
Make friends isn't that kind of what you saying

2281
01:32:27,264 --> 01:32:27,776
Friends

2282
01:32:28,544 --> 01:32:33,920
I guess you could probably get enough people to to be fine just by being a good guy

2283
01:32:34,176 --> 01:32:37,760
Attract more flies with honey

2284
01:32:38,016 --> 01:32:39,040
Injecting them with a blood

2285
01:32:39,296 --> 01:32:41,856
07 Trailblazer

2286
01:32:43,904 --> 01:32:48,000
That's an incel idea right there any

2287
01:32:50,304 --> 01:32:53,888
I did not consult are not a health Ranger

2288
01:32:54,144 --> 01:32:56,704
For this episode

2289
01:32:57,216 --> 01:32:58,752
I don't know if

2290
01:32:59,008 --> 01:33:00,288
There's something

2291
01:33:00,544 --> 01:33:01,312
In bats

2292
01:33:01,824 --> 01:33:02,336
You could inject

2293
01:33:02,848 --> 01:33:03,360
Into a human

2294
01:33:03,616 --> 01:33:04,384
That would make them drink

2295
01:33:04,896 --> 01:33:06,944
I don't know if that thing exists

2296
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:11,552
And I would need bad ideas to specifically tell me what that is

2297
01:33:11,808 --> 01:33:13,088
Otherwise

2298
01:33:14,368 --> 01:33:19,232
Is dumb some sort of enzymes

2299
01:33:19,488 --> 01:33:22,304
Breaks down blood into a more efficient

2300
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:28,704
Nutritional system I still don't think that would make me want to drink blood

2301
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:30,240
Woody Pizza

2302
01:33:30,496 --> 01:33:32,288
Just have

2303
01:33:32,544 --> 01:33:33,056
Pizza made you sick

2304
01:33:33,312 --> 01:33:35,872
Now what if it just inverted everything or probably

2305
01:33:36,128 --> 01:33:38,176
Gotas hot dogs

2306
01:33:51,488 --> 01:33:52,512
Would need to be something like

2307
01:33:53,024 --> 01:33:54,560
Wheatley rewired

2308
01:33:54,816 --> 01:33:57,120
The way you took in any kind of substance

2309
01:33:57,888 --> 01:34:00,192
So only blood

2310
01:34:01,216 --> 01:34:01,728
Cuz otherwise

2311
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:03,008
Like right now

2312
01:34:03,264 --> 01:34:03,776
I could

2313
01:34:04,032 --> 01:34:04,800
In theory

2314
01:34:05,056 --> 01:34:07,104
Maybe drink a glass of blood

2315
01:34:08,384 --> 01:34:08,896
Baby

2316
01:34:09,152 --> 01:34:11,968
That would be all I needed for the day

2317
01:34:12,224 --> 01:34:15,552
Awesome God willing I'll never know

2318
01:34:19,648 --> 01:34:21,184
What's a what's a

2319
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:27,584
If it gets bad enough then I will absolutely give you a pint you can see how it goes

2320
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:30,400
Are you running out of sandwich meat and lettuce

2321
01:34:30,656 --> 01:34:32,192
Here's a pint of blood

2322
01:34:32,448 --> 01:34:38,592
I ate some I'm typos so you're you're even clear on that will appreciate the offer and I will hold you to

2323
01:34:38,848 --> 01:34:39,872
Thank you

2324
01:34:40,128 --> 01:34:46,272
It's scary to think

2325
01:34:46,528 --> 01:34:47,808
Official guidance

2326
01:34:48,064 --> 01:34:48,832
The people might get

2327
01:34:50,112 --> 01:34:50,624
Remember

2328
01:34:51,136 --> 01:34:54,208
She thinks that people are being turned into Vampires by aliens

2329
01:34:54,976 --> 01:34:58,304
And these are my suggestions and I I realize that

2330
01:34:58,816 --> 01:34:59,328
If you

2331
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:00,608
Think otherwise

2332
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:02,656
You should follow whatever you think

2333
01:35:03,168 --> 01:35:05,472
You should follow whatever your heart tells you

2334
01:35:05,728 --> 01:35:07,264
And don't do that

2335
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:09,568
Tells you to wear a mask

2336
01:35:09,824 --> 01:35:12,128
And gloves when you go out of the house

2337
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:15,200
And cower in your house excetera then

2338
01:35:15,456 --> 01:35:16,480
Do by all means

2339
01:35:16,736 --> 01:35:17,504
Follow that up

2340
01:35:18,272 --> 01:35:18,784
And

2341
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:20,064
If you want to believe what

2342
01:35:21,088 --> 01:35:22,880
Open the mainstream news and all of the

2343
01:35:23,136 --> 01:35:23,904
Propaganda

2344
01:35:24,416 --> 01:35:26,464
Around you you are certainly

2345
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:27,744
Welcome to do that at

2346
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:28,512
As well

2347
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:32,352
What I am providing here is an alternative View

2348
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:34,400
And that includes vampires

2349
01:35:35,168 --> 01:35:35,936
What I do

2350
01:35:36,448 --> 01:35:36,960
I'm a psychic

2351
01:35:37,216 --> 01:35:37,728
Intuitive

2352
01:35:37,984 --> 01:35:38,496
And

2353
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:40,288
The gosh

2354
01:35:40,544 --> 01:35:44,128
And so this is what I do and I've been doing this now for 4

2355
01:35:44,384 --> 01:35:45,152
15 years

2356
01:35:45,408 --> 01:35:46,688
What doesn't mean

2357
01:35:46,944 --> 01:35:48,224
I've been right about anything

2358
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:51,296
Nope well if she hadn't been doing it this way

2359
01:35:51,808 --> 01:35:54,112
Wouldn't somebody have stopped her if this was crazy

2360
01:35:54,368 --> 01:35:57,696
Just ignore it

2361
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:06,144
Yeah you can wear gloves and a mask when you go out if you want to believe the dumb propaganda

2362
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:08,192
Tell you that I'm a psychic intuitive

2363
01:36:08,448 --> 01:36:08,960
And

2364
01:36:09,216 --> 01:36:10,240
Vampires

2365
01:36:11,264 --> 01:36:12,544
Disease isn't real

2366
01:36:13,056 --> 01:36:14,336
Also every other

2367
01:36:14,592 --> 01:36:15,616
Conspiracy that

2368
01:36:15,872 --> 01:36:17,152
Is promoted by the

2369
01:36:17,408 --> 01:36:20,480
Extreme right-wing folks like Alex Jones is

2370
01:36:21,248 --> 01:36:23,040
That's that's basically what you got here

2371
01:36:23,296 --> 01:36:23,808
3 minutes

2372
01:36:24,064 --> 01:36:26,112
It's interesting on one level and it again

2373
01:36:26,368 --> 01:36:28,160
There's no way I would not do an episode about

2374
01:36:28,416 --> 01:36:29,696
Vampires

2375
01:36:30,464 --> 01:36:30,976
Absolutely

2376
01:36:31,232 --> 01:36:33,792
Must know

2377
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:35,584
China is making vampire

2378
01:36:36,352 --> 01:36:36,864
Welder

2379
01:36:38,656 --> 01:36:41,472
Dragonfly cheetahs I have a good handle on

2380
01:36:41,728 --> 01:36:42,240
The dragon boss

2381
01:36:42,752 --> 01:36:43,264
I get it

2382
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:45,568
Aliens are out there who knows what they could be

2383
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:48,640
But we start bringing vampires into my house

2384
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:50,944
You're not okay

2385
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:56,064
Moths for making vampires

2386
01:36:56,320 --> 01:36:56,832
They're fine

2387
01:36:57,088 --> 01:37:03,232
They're fine they're leaving us alone for the most part maybe they're doing a diabolical plan here and there but now they're making vampires dad

2388
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:06,816
What's their diabolical plan

2389
01:37:08,096 --> 01:37:08,608
I don't know

2390
01:37:09,376 --> 01:37:09,888
So dumb

2391
01:37:11,936 --> 01:37:13,728
I wanted to really draw sharp Focus

2392
01:37:13,984 --> 01:37:16,800
I think we have is that some of this is really

2393
01:37:17,056 --> 01:37:17,568
Big fun

2394
01:37:17,824 --> 01:37:19,104
But the stuff it's not really fun

2395
01:37:19,616 --> 01:37:20,128
The same as ours

2396
01:37:22,176 --> 01:37:25,504
It's pointed Bears repeating over and over and over

2397
01:37:26,016 --> 01:37:26,528
Because

2398
01:37:26,784 --> 01:37:30,112
The same bad thinking will lead you to different places

2399
01:37:30,624 --> 01:37:31,392
But also the same

2400
01:37:31,648 --> 01:37:32,160
Play ASAP

2401
01:37:32,928 --> 01:37:33,952
It's a it's a problem

2402
01:37:34,464 --> 01:37:34,976
Technique

2403
01:37:35,488 --> 01:37:36,768
That manifest

2404
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:37,792
For Alex

2405
01:37:38,304 --> 01:37:40,096
Reboot away is that it does for him

2406
01:37:40,352 --> 01:37:42,656
Add with carry in the ways that it does for her

2407
01:37:43,168 --> 01:37:45,216
And she's a little bit more fun

2408
01:37:45,472 --> 01:37:47,008
Sometimes because of vampires

2409
01:37:48,544 --> 01:37:49,568
It's fundamentally the same thing

2410
01:37:50,848 --> 01:37:51,872
100 examples of this

2411
01:37:52,384 --> 01:37:54,176
That's really the spiritual connection

2412
01:37:54,432 --> 01:37:55,712
Between these two

2413
01:37:55,968 --> 01:37:56,992
Artio

2414
01:37:57,248 --> 01:37:58,272
And some other shows don't

2415
01:37:58,784 --> 01:38:00,832
Save-A-Lot

2416
01:38:01,088 --> 01:38:02,112
Yeah a lot of other

2417
01:38:02,624 --> 01:38:04,416
Options would work in the same way

2418
01:38:05,696 --> 01:38:06,720
Just being the same

2419
01:38:06,976 --> 01:38:08,256
Bed thinking process being

2420
01:38:08,512 --> 01:38:09,280
Manifested by

2421
01:38:09,792 --> 01:38:10,816
Who does not as interesting

2422
01:38:11,072 --> 01:38:12,096
You're not as

2423
01:38:12,352 --> 01:38:13,120
Stupid

2424
01:38:13,376 --> 01:38:19,008
Yeah I was a Not So based entirely of Sgt entirely on

2425
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:20,800
Oppositional defiance

2426
01:38:21,056 --> 01:38:22,336
And

2427
01:38:22,848 --> 01:38:25,408
A staunch denial of reality Jeff

2428
01:38:25,664 --> 01:38:26,944
Because everyone else agrees on that

2429
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:30,784
That must be that it's mine

2430
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:32,320
My friend who likes

2431
01:38:32,576 --> 01:38:33,600
Bleach got arrested

2432
01:38:33,856 --> 01:38:34,880
That must mean

2433
01:38:35,136 --> 01:38:38,208
Set the man was trying to make him look bad cuz he's

2434
01:38:38,976 --> 01:38:39,744
Did it do

2435
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,048
Those things are so common

2436
01:38:42,304 --> 01:38:42,816
With all our

2437
01:38:43,584 --> 01:38:46,656
Yeah I was I was just thinking or I was wondering like

2438
01:38:46,912 --> 01:38:50,752
Was there a moment where they cross-pollinated the the two

2439
01:38:51,008 --> 01:38:54,336
The Sci-Fi weirdo community in the hard right-wing community and then

2440
01:38:54,848 --> 01:38:59,200
Like I'm trying to go back through history to see if I can remember the guys like this and it's

2441
01:38:59,712 --> 01:39:00,224
It's always been there

2442
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:00,992
They're like the

2443
01:39:01,248 --> 01:39:05,344
Worst Gamers have almost always been like these hard right guys who believe that

2444
01:39:05,856 --> 01:39:07,904
Part of the part of the reason

2445
01:39:08,416 --> 01:39:09,696
That you are allowed to get

2446
01:39:09,952 --> 01:39:12,768
Scammed is because you're actually a bad person

2447
01:39:13,024 --> 01:39:14,048
It filters in the

2448
01:39:14,816 --> 01:39:15,584
I don't believe

2449
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:16,864
But everybody else

2450
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:19,424
But me is bad is going to lead you down to some hard right

2451
01:39:22,496 --> 01:39:24,544
A lot of these paranormal and

2452
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:27,104
Government oriented

2453
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:29,152
Conspiracy theories germinated

2454
01:39:29,408 --> 01:39:32,736
Similar places online message boards

2455

Frederick Cooper like he was

2459
01:39:43,488 --> 01:39:45,280
Largely especially towards

2460
01:39:46,048 --> 01:39:48,608
Later stages of his career definitely more

2461
01:39:48,864 --> 01:39:50,656
A patriot militia

2462
01:39:51,168 --> 01:39:51,680
Type of

01:39:51,936 --> 01:39:55,520
Conspiracy theorist but yeah a lot of paranormal stuff going

2464
01:39:55,776 --> 01:39:56,544
The

2465
01:39:57,056 --> 01:39:58,080
Sort of esoteric

2466
01:39:58,592 --> 01:40:01,664
Occult stuff in his career

2467
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:05,248
You have a lot of stuff over the last like

2468
01:40:05,504 --> 01:40:08,320
30 years right 30-40 years that have been like

But if you're into one you better

2472
01:40:13,952 --> 01:40:18,048
Is a decent chance you might be an algorithm

2473

Impossible to ignore

2474
01:40:21,888 --> 01:40:25,216
I think that you see a bit of it manifested in in these two different

2475
01:40:25,984 --> 01:40:28,032
Terrible shows
