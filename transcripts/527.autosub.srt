00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,736
Knowledge party.com

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for knowledge by knowledge

3
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:39,936
MoneyGram

4
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

5
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,136
Dot-com

6
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:07,840
But sit around drink novelty beverages in a little bit about Alex Jones what's up

7
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:13,216
My bright spot today Jordan comes in the form of a series

8
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:16,800
Decided

9
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:18,592
Make a note choices on cereal right

10
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,944
It is a Dunkin Donuts

11
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:25,248
Flavor

12
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:26,016
Mocha

13
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:28,832
No mocha coffee.

14
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,112
Hard pass

15
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:32,672
Throw a spirit that box

16
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:35,488
I stared at it for a while because it was like well

17
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:36,768
I'm drowning

18
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:40,608
But there's another voice that was telling me

19
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:43,424
This the novelty that's going to get you burned

20
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,240
Right right

21
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:49,056
Honestly there was also when there was a caramel macchiato

22
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,592
And I said that looks gross

23
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:55,968
That is definitely going to burn me

24
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:01,344
It's is right between those two

25
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:04,928
Perfect greige

26
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:08,256
2fa

27
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,608
Yai

28
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,400
I got it it's great

29
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,288
Ecorse shockingly good

30
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,152
It takes like a mocha coffee so I thought they were going to taste like donut

31
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:27,968
Type they know it and it's got like

32
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:32,576
It's basically the texture of it is there's like little marshmallows and then the

33
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:35,136
Cereal itself is basically just like Cocoa Puffs

34
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:35,904
Okay

35
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,672
It's just a

36
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:38,976
I don't know I mean

37
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:42,048
It's not great it's just

38
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,072
I expected

39
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:46,912
To be a real dangerous proposition

40
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:52,288
Imagine Dunkin Donuts probably won't release cereal based on my coffee

41
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,312
3 flavor which is

42
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:54,848
Black

43
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:57,408
Just a bird

44
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,688
Terry verdict

45
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,224
Black

46
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,272
A whole pot of it

47
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:05,088
Hosted going to come out with a full Journey

48
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:10,976
No cream I don't foresee that happening

49
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,512
Drinking coffee

50
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:18,912
This introduces an actual interesting problem was that bad is that if you're having black coffee flavored cereal

51
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:25,312
Do you put milk in there

52
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:27,360
Absolutely okay

53
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:29,920
Brood

54
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:30,688
Silly

55
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,736
Haha that's a that's a red eye

56
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,296
Not Material

57
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:37,088
What about you with your brights on

58
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:42,976
My brights is the new album by madlib sound ancestors

59
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:48,608
Very very good okay good it's all music that was

60
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,168
Made by madlib over the span of like

61
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,704
The past two years

62
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:55,008
You do you do Mad Libs

63
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:56,288
You know how all he does

64
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:59,360
Just sit around and make music all the time

65
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:05,760
I got that sense, I don't know him personally but yet it seems Seems like he likes music

66
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,552
He's like one of those guys who's just like

67
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:08,832
I know what I do

68
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:11,392
How do I make music and everything else

69
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:18,559
Yeah that's that's basically like me and looking at Alex Joe now why I'm drawn to you and

70
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:21,631
People with your weird committed people

71
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,423
Because I'm a little late

72
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:28,543
R5

73
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,591
Is arranged by Four Tet and it's

74
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:31,359
Really really

75
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,895
Really really good

76
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,967
I'll have to get that out of spit

77
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:41,343
I've been getting back on the bike a little bit and I've been needing some more music

78
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:46,463
Throw into the rotation I've been listening to a lot of Polish ambassador

79
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:50,559
Enjoy the Polish ambassador

80
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:51,327
Skype

81
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:58,495
You think I don't know we'll see the Polish ambassador

82
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,287
Listen to

83
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:06,431
While I enjoy there's an album called

84
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:08,479

What album are you talkin about actually pull it up here cuz

86
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:15,391

The tide

92
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,311
Coming to that's really

93
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:37,151
It's good for a little bit of riding the bike cardio Stout

94
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:43,551
Check out that madlib album to just going to end up drifting back to like Carly Rae Jepsen

95
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:45,343
Girl with mixing a little bit of that

96
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:49,439
I can listening to Sky I'm never going to hear the end of it

97
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,719
I got to be trouble

98
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:56,095
I generally if I have that feeling I only listen to the Sami Zayn intro music

99
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,119
Cuz that's great

100
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:00,191
Batman also Christian

101
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:05,823
Supertones

102
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:10,175
I rarely ever listen to other Scott stuff on

103
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,967
If you listen to Chris

104
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:12,735
Skin scab

105
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:15,807
Backwards is that like running away from God

106
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:17,855
That works

107
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:25,535
So Jordan today we talking about February 4th

108
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:30,143
Sucralose

109
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,471
Stuff happening

On this episode

111
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,799

00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,415
The first villain Jack

116
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:54,207
Ewok

117
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,487

00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:14,431
15 * the words

122
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:18,783
Next I guess murder Hornets were just a filler episode you and I'll follow siwa

123

Thank you very much camera

125
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:34,911
Mr. Jim

126
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:40,543
I think you took a people donated on elevator that would appreciate that very much so first he's a sandwich

127
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,591
Call One Work thank you so much you're now technocrat

128
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:45,919
Take my money you filthy animals thank you so much right now it's

129
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:46,687
Technocrat

130
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:58,463
Money off that heroin

131
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:03,071
Large

132
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,727
Which name to because

133
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:15,103
The gotten into some aggressive arguments in my time about whether things are or are not sandwich

134
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:18,687
Yeah I've heard of people doing

135
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,223
Disconcert to me babe

136
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:25,343
It's people that have strong feelings about sandwiches really introduces a philosophical question

137
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,879
About what does

138
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:27,903
Constitute

139
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:29,439
Sandwich

140
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,207
Hot dogs

141
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:30,975
Is classic

142
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:34,559
Thing that will cause people to come to loggerheads

143
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,351
A divisive topic

144
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:40,447
But once you start talking about that you enter the world of taco

145
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:41,983
Is the Taco thing

146
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:46,847
I know see that's what I'm saying once you start getting into that

147
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:48,639
It's dangerous

148
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,687
The slippery slope only trust

149
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:53,247
The word of the Earl himself

150
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,271
And he is not

151
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:59,647
Spoken regarding hot dogs so I say that it's fine or it's not fine it does not matter until

152
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:00,927
Alright well

153
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:02,207
We will go with that

154
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:06,815
So Jordan today this episode like I said we're doing February 4th and

155
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:09,375
My path to this was

156
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,143
A challenge

157
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:15,519
Because I was trying to get myself really motivated

158
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:16,543
You know

159
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:20,895
Talk about Alex on Monday Monday

160
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:21,663
Cover the week

161
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,711
And then he started talking like this

162
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:24,735
I can't handle it

163
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:30,879
Transfer

164
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,183
All of the

165
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,375
Resources and jobs

166
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:42,911
Overseas

167
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:47,775
The public's got to go into a conscious mode buddy gets really unconscious

168
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,567
Just trying to accept what's coming

169
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:54,175
I love him to death but I said if Mike Lee whatever sticking up

170
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,967
You got to tell me on here

171
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:58,271
Open your eyes look for problem

172
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,319
I got a booger hanging out of my nose

173
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,855
They will do it

174
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,671
I called her second straight up

175
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:10,559
Don't work

176
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:12,863
But it's going to take

177
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,079
Yeah I was now wow

178
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:23,615
Load up

179
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:30,015
Okay you basically having an HR meeting where you scolding the crew for not telling him that his collar was out but in

180
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:33,855
The guys of talking about how when you're unconscious the globalist composed

181
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:37,951
Seem like he's turning what is a very Petty

182
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:42,047
You guys should know I'm incapable of basic hygiene

183
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:45,375
And take care of me he'll tell them

184
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:47,423
Talk to your staff during the breaks

185
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,703
Make your points

186
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,775
I just wasn't like this so

187
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,055
Stupid I can't even

188
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:57,919
Wild yeah it felt like walking through with knee-deep mud and I don't need it

189
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:02,015
And so I decided you know like maybe I'll go

190
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:06,623
And try to find some Project Camelot

191
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,903
Indeed

192
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:08,671
Nugget

193
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:12,511
Not great so we decided we're going to a time travel episode to go back to the past

194
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:17,375
I listen to episode from 2011

195
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:21,983
Alex trying to get really excited about the Bilderberg

196
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,007
And it made sense

197
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,287
Everything

198
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:30,687
Use really excited about this Swiss

199
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:37,087
Holocaust denier that he didn't realize of the Holocaust denier

200
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,879
Jordan

201
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,671
I heard

202
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:47,071
February 4th the year 2021 and Doctor Steve pieczenik

203
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:50,143
Musically really appreciate it

204
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,959
Power number 2

205
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,263
That is

206
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,287
Catnip

207
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:58,335
There's nothing we can do

208
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:03,711
There's certain times in doing this show where you just got to resign yourself to like well

209
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:08,319
Steve's back on after saying Trump

210
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,599
Still be president

211
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:13,439
After January 20th or I'll eat my hat potentially

212
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:19,327
If he's not president then I'll never come on your show again it right if I am you got to hire me

213
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,887
So no one is happy

214
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:26,239
Interested

215
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,823
I'm interested to see what kind of big

216
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,383
Swing is going on here is a lunatic

217
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:37,759
I don't know babe you just never know what to expect

218
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,039
And

219
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:42,111
I'm hoping for a double down

220
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,391
I'm hoping for him

221
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,415
To come right out and

222
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,183
Say it

223
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,207
Trump

224
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,487
Still Perez

225
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:52,095
I am going to say

226
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:54,655
Completely unrelated to what you want

227
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:57,983
Sure don't take this as a sign whether that is or is not going to happen okay

228
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:01,311
I'll say that I was a little underwhelmed by this

229
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,359
Interview on both of their paw

230
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:08,479
I was a little underwhelmed by Alex and by Steve although there is some hilarious stuff it happen

231
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:14,879
Should have been screaming at each other constantly this should have been a knock-down-drag-out

232
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:18,463
You have been lying to me since the beginning and I then

233
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,487
Stevi B's we like

234
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:22,303
Of course I've been lying to you you're a bull ride

235
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:25,887
Not that Steve agreed to do it or if he did he doesn't

236
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,679
He does not give

237
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,703
Ward Park

238
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,983
It's nuts that Alex

239
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,775
Clearly doesn't have more of a plan

240
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,079
Obvious

241
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,103
It's just

242
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,127
Instilling

243
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,967
So Alex Sabaton the second hour

244
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:40,735
I got to get

245
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,271
To some other news in the first hour

246
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:46,879
What cities are liars and I'm going to show you AOC caught in the LIE we talked about

247
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:50,975
Look up where offices

248
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:53,279
She's a junior member of the House

249
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:57,375
Actually been there while she was a congresswoman tits are scurrying around the halls

250
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:02,239
He wasn't even in the damn capital

251
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:08,639
This woman

252
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:10,175
Is a congenital

253
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:13,503
When I get to that in a moment

254
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:17,599
Launch about

255
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:21,695
While

256
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:23,743
Good stuff good

257
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,535
She didn't claim to have been

258
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:26,815
Cynthia Capitol building

259
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:29,887
But her building itself was also evacuated

260
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:36,287
I don't know I understand that the right-wing really desperately needs

261
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,567
To try and minimize the

262
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,591
The human trauma

263
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:41,407
Those experienced by the people who are the victims of the

264
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,711
Consequences of their rhetoric

265
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:47,039
Are we tried to get you guys murdered but you're lying about

266
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:52,415
Yeah I understand why people like Candace Owens eject Pacifica really pushing these things hard and Alex

267
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,439
Now jumping on

268
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:55,487
This is well like I get it

269
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,255
It's just

270
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:57,279
Dumb it's

271
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,303
It's awful.

272
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,583
Toosii

273
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:00,607
Denying

274
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,887
Denying her her

275
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,167
Experiences is

276
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:08,543
Yeah I know it's more f***** up things I can think of I

277
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,079
I'd like it if I

278
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,639
From an empathetic

279
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:16,735
If I put myself in their shoes I imagine I too would scramble

280
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:20,575
Because I would not want to reckon with the idea that I am essentially an attempt

281
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,879
4ukey

282
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,159
But I don't think that they have

283
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:26,207
I think they're just basic

284
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:26,975
Psychopath

285
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:29,023
Tonight like what this is what we got to do to protect the

286
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,839
The grift not that I don't care I don't care

287
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,119
Murder

288
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:37,471
I think part of it is protecting the Griff but then also I think a part of it

289
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,495
What

290
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:43,103
You know it is something that is so essential to a lot of these narratives is the

291
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:45,407
Inability or the desire not

292
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,943
To feel bad about anything

293
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:47,967
Yeah

294
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:48,991
And that would

295
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:53,599
Penetrate that bubble pretty hard recognizing these are human consequences

296
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:55,391
These

297
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:57,695
Fiercely theories in this this b*******

298
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:58,719
Get paddled

299
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:02,815
And to recognize that would probably introduce some bad feeling

300
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:04,607
Do you know that

301
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,911
Not in their interest now that would hurt

302
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,191
Yeah

303
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,215
So Alex

304
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:15,359
Just Mayo see shared and then he flips into an ad and like he doesn't entire segment

305
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,383
It's just ads

306
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:19,711
The entire second segment of the show is at

307
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:21,759
It's just unbelievable

308
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:29,183
It's toothpaste so I can hide more money in his company it's a drag it almost feels like Alex thinks that announcing that Steve's going to

309
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:31,487
To be on the show is going to somehow boost ratings

310
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:34,559
How many does extended commercial

311
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:38,143
The message

312
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:40,703
Then he gets back to teasing

313
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,727
Steve interview

314
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:45,311
Dr. Steve pieczenik we have to clip a planter in a few minutes

315
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:48,127
Has the courage to come back on the show

316
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,319
Here a month ago before

317
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:58,367
January 20th

318
00:16:59,391 --> 00:16:59,903
And

319
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:03,743
Talk to him

320
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:04,767
Can't wait

321
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:05,535
Can't wait

322
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,327
Man

323
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:13,983
Here's the thing that I take issue with with a comment like that what Alex is doing is he's framing Steve's commented

324
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:17,823
He shouldn't be prediction prediction

325
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:18,847
Yes

326
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:19,615
Steve's

327
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:22,943
Been saying he's involved in

328
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,759
Predicting something will happen no

329
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:26,783
Doing

330
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,855
It would be a completely different show and people would

331
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:32,159
Take it as seriously if you just like

332
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:35,999
Hey I don't know anything I'm just get out here's what I think happened

333
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:42,399
Intelligent

334
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:46,495
Expert with all of his connections if you're just going to ask him for random ass predict

335
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:49,823
Yeah when he says I'm involved in this s***

336
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:50,847
Then

337
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:54,431
You know your brain is like oh he must be talking about something

338
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:59,551
If he just says I predict this is going to happen even start to recognize all his predictions

339
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:03,903
He's not doing well anymore

340
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:05,439
Might be a bad idea

341
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,719
Experience

342
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:11,071
Completely different to a listener when you presented as like

343
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:12,863
I did this I put

344
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:15,167
QR codes on all the ballots

345
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:20,031
You know what I what I don't understand about alley

346
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:23,103
Is that I feel like he was missing that

347
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,895
Golden opportunity

348
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:25,919
Of like

349
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:32,063
When you when you can cut ties with one of these assholes

350
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:37,951
It's like getting rid of it's like when you're playing Go Fish or Old Maid or whatever it is where you can like

351
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:39,999
I'm discarding this card

352
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:42,047
I am not losing the card I am

353
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:44,863
Giving it up giving the bad thing away you know like

354
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,911
When you cut ties with a Stevi B's

355
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,447
You can throw so many

356
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:50,751
Bloated narratives on a

357
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:54,079
Like just toss all the s*** that you don't want anymore out

358
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:58,431
Exactly be like. All that was all seems like you'd like

359
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,967
Go all-in

360
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:03,551
You land it all on him don't matter you wouldn't be lying

361
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:07,135
For the most part is fluent

362
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:09,439
Stalzys Naked and Famous

363
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:11,743
Play I don't know I think it's Steve

364
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:12,767
Because of Alex

365
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,559
As built up

366
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:16,607
His own organic fanbase

367
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:18,143
Is a threat

368
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:18,911
Italics

369
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:20,447
If

370
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:23,007
If he turns out Steve to

371
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:26,591
What a goddamn moron

372
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:30,175
Basically are just like pointing guns

373
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:32,735
They're just sitting there like an impasse

374
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:36,063
What are we doing

375
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,343
It's a goose builds up these

376
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:40,671
No-win situations with these lunatics

377
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:44,767
And then here we are a man who is more dedicated to

378
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:46,815
To hoisted himself upon his own petard

379
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:50,143
Seems to work I mean profitable

380
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:52,191
I'm also I forgot about this

381
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:56,031
I forgot we we need to give a shout-out to someone whose birthday

382
00:19:56,287 --> 00:20:00,639
Alexis sent her an email and told us that Sean

383
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:02,687
Celebrating a birthday happy birthday

384
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:07,039
Just wanted to give you a little bit of a happy birthday happy birthday

385
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:10,111
Mandy Moore

386
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,135
Birthdays

387
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:11,903
No it is not

388
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,695
Nobody asked nobody which

389
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:15,743
Shih Tzu more birthdays than you would die sooner

390
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:18,047
No they don't want you to have no more

391
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,959
Kind of a guy but the more birthdays you have the closer you are to death

392
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:31,871
But if you do cuz if you have more it's further off something here alright

393
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:33,919
What you to race closer and closer to your end

394
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:36,223
Dornier literally making no sense

395
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:39,551
Because neither desire

396
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:41,087
Text

397
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,183
All right here's the bottom

398
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,207
Let's hear the bottom

399
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:50,303
Most of the first hour is spent with Alex talking disgustingly in

400
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,839
Grotesquely about child

401
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:55,167
And we're not going to listen to any of that

402
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,983
And I have my reasons for it

403
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:03,103
And if anybody takes issue with that I will say that we've covered some of that stuff in the past

404
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:05,919
It doesn't add anything to

405
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,991
Demonstrate these things at over and over again

406
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,271
And I

407
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:11,551
Believe that the way that I look

408
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:12,575
What's Carrie's himself

409
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:13,855
What has the potential

410
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:15,391
To be re-traumatized

411
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:16,159
Two people

412
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,696
And I don't want

413
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,720
To be a part of

414
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,512
Bringing that to our audience

415
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:22,304
And I want I want no part of it

416
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,584
If you think that is

417
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,608
Hey Ben

418
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:29,984
Inappropriate decision on my part I would encourage you to start your own Alex Jones podcast

419
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,568
We've had out many times has he been on the show saying that s***

420
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:35,104
Go back and listen to it

421
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,152
Saying the same s*** it happens a lot

422
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:40,992
Singularly grotesque

423
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:42,272
Example of it

424
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:47,904
And I only have two clips that aren't actually about that but are about like

425
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,696
Little things that he's saying

426
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:51,488
On the side of

427
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:56,608
Those conversations that are kind of stupid and maybe a little bit

428
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,888
First one

429
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:58,656
Is my cannabis

430
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,984
There are a lot of currencies on the planet

431
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:04,288
The Establishment operates.

432
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:06,080
There's cash

433
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:07,104
Digital money

434
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,640
There's a derivatives

435
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:09,664
There's art

436
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:11,200
There's drugs

437
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:12,736
Their sexism

438
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,576
And there is

439
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:18,368
All sports

440
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,648
Pleasures

441
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:22,208
I mean a big one is eating dead.

442
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:25,792
A lot of establishment people really lie

443
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:30,400
I'm from morgz and stuff

444
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,936
Dead kids and people

445
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:35,008
Watching blade

446
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,544
My dad told me all about it

447
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,336
Guatemala news

448
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:40,384
That's how I know this is nonsense

449
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,760
Wow whatever you're Alex Jones me like I'm a big serious expert on the New World Order

450
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:48,576
Dad told me people getting eaten

451
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:53,440
My dad said one time that I need a person

452
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:56,768
I would say that if you want to be taken seriously

453
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:07,776
You can prove these claims you don't need to say my dad told me when I was little I discovered

454
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:14,176
While you were sleeping if you would love to someone will break into your home and brutally rip it from Bonneau

455
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:14,944
Need your pillow

456
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,504
Will they leave something behind I don't know

457
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:20,064
But I read it in the news later on in life it's been

458
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:20,832
Confirm

459
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:26,208
So Alex Jones's dad scary bedtime stories notwithstanding

460
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:30,560
Detail with the more we learn about his dad

461
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:34,912
The amount of the f****** dude f***** up Alex a f***** up.

462
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,448
Except you.

463
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:41,056
So the other clip that Alex has here is easy

464
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:41,824
You know

465
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:44,384
Whenever you like

466
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:46,432
People get rich

467
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:48,480
They start to need more

468
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:50,016
Exciting thing

469
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:54,112
The mundane pleasures of life sometimes

470
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:56,160
Are not with a

471
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:57,952
Sports cars

472
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:03,072
It's an escalation problem the moment you've achieved your dream now you have

473
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:04,096
How to find something else to

474
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:07,424
Bright Alex discusses a little bit and I should tell you this

475
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,704
This is a family show

476
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,640
Very popular first album

477
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:19,712
Eat big bowls of fresh PCS

478
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:20,992
Right off of woman's rear end

479
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,856
I just want you to know

480
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:28,928
What we're up against and what we're dealing with

481
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,464
Alright Alex

482
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:31,744
Okay

483
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:38,400
Fine

484
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:42,496
LOL

485
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:46,592
Here's what I saw

486
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:47,616
Nancy Pelosi

487
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:49,408
Sitting at

488
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:50,688
Much like ours right

489
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:51,968
Like I like it

490
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:57,088
You're you're fairly close to me if you were to stand up turn around and just start shiting into a pole

491
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:58,624
I could grab a spoon in

492
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,464
Eat as you s*** out of it that's what I saw Nancy Pelosi

493
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,744
Is that what you

494
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:10,144
I didn't have any mental image except for Alex just like his brain trying to be like what can I say that's gross

495
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:12,448
I mean look

496
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,728
Humans are not

497
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:14,752
Good eating

498
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:18,848
From a nutritional standpoint it doesn't make sense for people to eat human

499
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:21,152
And there's also

500
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:23,712
Nutritional issues with eating feces

501
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:26,272
It's not I mean both are great

502
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:27,296
Particularly

503
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:30,368
Pleasurable

504
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:35,232
Sometimes I order Chinese food tonight I know it's not maybe the most healthy decisions about the

505
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,000
Pleasure of

506
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:37,024
Eating

507
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,072
I imagine the same thing as Trooper

508
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:45,472
Eating s*** coming out of a woman oral fecal transmitted

509
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:50,080
Or I mean eating humans

510
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:53,664
You can come down from with

511
00:25:57,248 --> 00:26:02,624
Alex gets around to the Steve interview

512
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:04,672
Easing into the introduction

513
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,768
Coming to you live from the 80s

514
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:10,560
Broadcasting worldwide

515
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:13,120
I'm not going to try to rehabilitate

516
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:18,496
He did leave the CFR and say 9/11 was an inside job

517
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:20,032
Paul the real perpetrators out

518
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,080
We're actually involves orchestrating

519
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:27,712
What

520
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:32,832
I thought he was buying into the whole Q8 Chan deal

521
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:34,624
Here is a problem

522
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,392
For me

523
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:37,184
If you believe that he's a man

524
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,976
Expert inside person

525
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,512
He should not be

526
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:42,816
Like at all persuaded by Q stuff

527
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:44,864
If you have for a moment

528
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,144
The inclination to think

529
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,168
Steve pieczenik

530
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:47,936
He's getting it

531
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:50,240
Influence by stuff on a message board

532
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:56,384
You should very seriously question whether or not you should take anything anything seriously he is supposed to

533
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,176
To be behind the scenes

534
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,552
Which would be behind the siop that you have argued Q must be

535
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:08,160
So how could someone behind-the-scenes unless you saying that there's a

536
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:09,952
He behind the scenes

537
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:13,536
By the other behind-the-scenes people

538
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:14,560
3Q

539
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:15,584
Oh no

540
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:21,984
What are you doing letting him behind the scenes if he's going to get tricked by other people behind the scene

541
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,288
Started is too good It's Tricky

542
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:26,592
Please shut the f***

543
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:29,408
So Alex is gracious

544
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:34,272
64 coming back and my note on this is just like why are they doing why why

545
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:36,576
Appreciate

546
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,368
Steve pieczenik coming on

547
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,136
I am

548
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:41,440
Amazon

549
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,464
What's punch that up

550
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,000
Is this the beginning class Center

551
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:49,632
Why I just I don't understand this doesn't serve anyone's interest

552
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,448
Steve is going to have to go even

553
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,216
Further

554
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:55,520
Out on a limb in order to

555
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:57,056
Retain any sense

556
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:58,336
Credibility at all

557
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:00,384
Alex is going to have to either

558
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,432
Confront somebody who he clearly does

559
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:04,992
The fortitude to confront

560
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:10,112
Or he's going to have to get persuaded by Steve to wait and see

561
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:11,392
Whatever

562
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:16,256
Situation for anybody except receive nothing to lose

563
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:19,328
The Alex's insistence on

564
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:20,096
Not

565
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:20,864
Preparing

566
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,912
Coming through immediately with us

567
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:25,728
I don't even remember what date it was I wouldn't

568
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:28,544
Promise to me

569
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:30,080
The world would

570
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:30,848
Oh my God

571
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:36,480
60 sucks and I think he's a real liar and a menace

572
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,016
But

573
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:39,296
That being said

574
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,576
I do think that

575
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:42,112
The first question that Alex asked

576
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:42,880
Is on

577
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:45,696
Okay I do think this is not the way even there

578
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:48,000
This is not how you want to start interview

579
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,608
Tell us a joke

580
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:55,936
Are you in with a few guys were you part of the setup or were you really

581
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:58,240
Believing this was going to happen we really appreciate you coming on

582
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:00,544
Number one eye

583
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,336
Enjoy coming on the show number

584
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:06,432
Is the ad hominem comments

585
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,248
Disgusting

586
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,272
Yours

587
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:13,600
Thanks that I lied for in some way

588
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:14,368
Gave them false

589
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,136
Promise

590
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:16,672
Table turned on you in a

591
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:20,512
You don't get

592
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:21,536
To do this

593
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:22,816
You do not

594
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:23,584
Alex

595
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,888
Alex tries to frame the interview

596
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:31,776
With three options for Steve to pick that are all bad. Steve says I like coming on her show

597
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:33,056
We're going to say is that you

598
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:36,640
You're disgusting are you this bunch of assholes who keeps saying bad things about me

599
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:37,664
Wild

600
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,200
So pathetic

601
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:42,528
Yeah Steve takes control he only texts

602
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:43,552
Just none

603
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:46,880
You can see it even at mediately just like now you're

604
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:48,928
It's not even in over your head

605
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:54,560
You don't have the wherewithal is it here's what here's what you do whenever somebody does that one

606
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:57,632
That is a shity opening question

607
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:58,400
F*** you

608
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:00,704
Steve comes back with

609
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,496
I don't appreciate you say hey

610
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:04,800
F*** you Steve you f****** lied

611
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:08,640
I would suggest that a better question is not

612
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:10,688
Three possibilities

613
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:13,504
That are all things he can't possibly accept

614
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:16,576
More open-ended question that is leading

615
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:17,344
To the

616
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:19,136
The f*** is wrong with you man

617
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:20,928
That would be a better opening

618
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:27,328
If you are wise you will allow Steve to hang himself right if you were the one who maybe prepares you to have a question

619
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:32,448
Guide you towards where you want to go as opposed to one that you're

620
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:33,728
Person you're talking to

621
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:34,752
Wheatley reject

622
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:36,544
Yeah

623
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:41,664
Volvo of all the like

624
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,200
So simple

625
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:43,968
Judo

626
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:44,992
Principles

627
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:46,272
To be put into

628
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,808
To be demonstrated right here

629
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:50,624
Alex attacks with overwhelming Force

630
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:51,904
And Steve just

631
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,440
Get out of the way

632
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:56,512
And then once Alex's horse

633
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:59,584
Has gone past him he turned the back

634
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:01,888
I came on the show again

635
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,936
The basically say to you

636
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:06,240
I will double down on the military

637
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:10,080
And the reason I'm doubling down is that

638
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:11,360
Right now

639
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:12,896
It's taking more time

640
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:16,992
And I don't directly deal with military operatives

641
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:19,808
Yes I had in the past when I went over

642
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:20,832
Received

643
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:22,368
I still have faith

644
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:23,392
In my side

645
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:25,440
I have faith in my special

646
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:26,208
Forces

647
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,768
I have faith in the generals

648
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:30,304
You don't have

649
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,840
Special Forces theme

650
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:36,448
I was right I was right he did double down that is what I was expecting

651
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:39,008
Yeah maybe

652
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,800
Not the not the point it

653
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:41,568
Yeah

654
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:46,176
Yeah it's not it's not as big as willing as you do but it is

655
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:46,944
Is cool

656
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:48,736
I mean like in terms of like

657
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:50,784
Now what are you going to do Alex yeah

658
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,552
Yeah

659
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:55,648
Steve was wrong he came back and now he's telling you he was right

660
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:03,328
You almost could have predicted this coming seeing as how he has had no interest in whether or not reality

661
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:04,352
Conforms to his

662
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:06,144
Bulshit Stevens

663
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:12,544
Absolutely gaslighting the s*** imagined that he would baby come come try to me

664
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:16,896
I'm sorry for lying to you also you're not even getting to the under of the underlying emotional problems

665
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:18,688
Which has he told you

666
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:19,968
He has been using you

667
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,552
Yeah yeah they don't get into that

668
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:24,832
Surprise

669
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:27,392
Everything is going according to Trump

670
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:28,672
Plan apparently

671
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:32,256
Only one person in the media really understand the gift

672
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:34,816
This subtle thing that's going on and that is

673
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:36,352
Is the Trump is being quiet

674
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:37,376
Maybe

675
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:41,216
That's because he's got an impeachment trial coming up and kicked off all social media

676
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:43,008
One person

677
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,288
It's it okay

678
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:46,080
This should piss off Alex but I think

679
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:47,360
He is distracted

680
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:49,408
So what I'm saying to you right

681
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:50,176
Now is

682
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:52,480
What you're seeing happening is it

683
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:54,528
Free what Trump wanted

684
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:55,296
App

685
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:56,320
Music

686
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:59,392
You got to remember one thing us

687
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,208
Elsa 20.

688
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:03,744
And by the way

689
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:05,792
He is remain silent

690
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:06,816
Only one

691
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,352
Individual

692
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:09,632
Repeat it

693
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:11,168
That's Bill Maher

694
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:14,240
HBO he hit it right on the head

695
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:15,776
Why

696
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:17,056
Is Trump

697
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:18,080
Silent

698
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:19,360
When India's history

699
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,152
He has never been silent

700
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:23,968
Insightful

701
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:27,552
Alex's big anime

702
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:28,832
It's just

703
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:32,160
You know who they watch all the time

704
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:33,952
By how much they reference

705
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:35,232
About how much they hate them

706
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:37,280
Free time

707
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:39,328
Because you watch Bill Maher all the time so you

708
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:41,632
Can hate them eventually says something weird like

709
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:43,424
You know what this bill Mark I might be right

710
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,216
Cuz you guys are f****** chill

711
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:47,776
Toddlers you can't

712
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:54,176
It's just two seconds of Lego I hate him I love him and I'm not going to say that this person doesn't exist but I don't know any

713
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,712
Anyone I like who likes films

714
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:02,368
I don't know anyone I like who likes Bill Maher either person may exist

715
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:03,904
And I just don't know it

716
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,440
And I wouldn't judge them for it

717
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:11,072
But the only people I have any evidence watch Bill Maher are people tweeting stuff

718
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:11,840
Yeah

719
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:13,376
Alex and hoop dance

720
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:15,424
Yeah that does sound right

721
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,728
Is the old is Bill Maher just

722
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:24,128
Maybe that's why you going so far with the racist right nonsense it's just he's like oh I guess the only people who watch my show Arbor

723
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:28,224
Is Dennis Miller and you might be dead as melaragno

724
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,272
Goddamnit cowboy

725
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:31,808
Equally on funny

726
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,416
Trump his whole plan right is to tighten

727
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:38,208
Show his ass

728
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:40,000
He's going to show how incompetent

729
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:40,768
He is

730
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:42,560
And this is where Steve begin

731
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:44,096
Things to drift into

732
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:45,632
Possible antisemita

733
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:48,960
He's showing you how corrupt

734
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:51,776
I said to you before

735
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,104
Text

736
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,128
People who aren't

737
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:56,896
Confident

738
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:57,664
And Coronavirus

739
00:34:58,688 --> 00:34:59,456

They were Jewish I have a synagogue

Going on there with blanket

742
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:04,832
With all kinds

743
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:07,392
The people in there

744
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:11,488
I've never met

745
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,304
What's a rolling company

746
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,608
It's really be

747
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:19,424
Paola Marino the point that people are do how

748
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:25,824
Wow it is you you are I wouldn't have even thought of that is something to bring up unless I were saying

749
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:26,592
Nazi

750
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:29,664
It's so weird the way he speaks to just that like

751
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,688
I've got

752
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:34,016
I've got these people in the government like

753
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:37,600
I think he just designs trading card.

754
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:42,464
I genuinely think that he just draws like magic the Gathering cards

755
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,232
And they have like

756
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:44,768
Nancy Pelosi

757
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:47,328
Deep State operative written on them any just

758
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,936
Begin to wonder

759
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:53,472
If he's not like

760
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,264
Severely Disturbed

761
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:56,288
Like

762
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:57,056
Weave

763
00:35:57,312 --> 00:36:03,456
Talk about him I think it one of the reasons any may not come off as that is because he's in the Infowars fear

764
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:06,784
And Alex portrays him as like this really

765
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:07,552
Serious

766
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:08,576
Character in

767
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:10,880
It's really funny when he sniffs at Alex

768
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:12,672
There's a part of me that

769
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:14,464
You know it has to wrestle with like

770
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:17,024
He actually think that he's running like

771
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:19,328
Special Operations teams

772
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:20,096
Does he think

773
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,936
He has sway within the government and he's got these

774
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:27,008
He's 11 Jewish people who he's never met working

775
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:29,056
In various offices Mecca

776
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,616
The problem for him personally I don't know

777
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:35,456
His wife laughing in the background that clip makes me really

778
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:36,736
Think that he's aware

779
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:38,272
She laughs about some other

780
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:39,296
Up to

781
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:40,064
Shiza

782
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:46,720
Maybe she's on this on the same boat she's in the front seat of whatever boats

783
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:48,512
She's not too thrilled

784
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:51,584
People either

785
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:55,168
National Security Council and the state

786
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:55,936
Department

787
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:59,008
And Wendy Sherman

788
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:02,336
I got a two on top that has never been in

789
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:07,456
Flower gorilla 45 minutes

790
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:13,856
Are the Galaxy there cuz you realize like this is going too much

791
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:18,208
Don't say I got to do on top ever

792
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:20,512
Outrageous

793
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:21,536
Outrage

794
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:25,376
So in this sad this next Cliff they get

795
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:26,656
To the heart of the matter which

796
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:27,424
Got anything

797
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,704
You're actually more correct

798
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:30,752
At the heart of the matter is that

799
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:33,056
Steve reveal that he's been manipulating our

800
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:37,152
Feeling getting into that cuz they don't the issue is

801
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:38,176
He said the trunk

802
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:39,712
Still going to be president

803
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:40,992
After

804
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:42,784
January 20th

805
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,064
I get a little bit snippy

806
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,344
Alex gets snippy

807
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,368
Steve-O

808
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:47,648
Let's just go back

809
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:48,928
Let's just go with your scenario

810
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,256
Doing is anti-racism Stand Down

811
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:58,912
Military coup

812
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:00,960
You're saying there's military coup what's going on there

813
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:10,432
Dodge right on the 20th

814
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:15,040
He was going to get inaugurated

815
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:16,576
20

816
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,160
I said that he would still be president of the United

817
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:22,464
What's going on in Maryland

818
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:25,792
Oh no

819
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:30,144
Psycho

820
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,680
Hang up

821
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:38,080
Steve thinks Trump is still present course he does what's going on in May

822
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:44,480
Exactly.

823
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:47,040
Hang up

824
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:49,600
Out like

825
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:50,880
Now na

826
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:52,416
But you have that

827
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:54,208
You don't get to be angry at me right

828
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:56,000
You don't get to do that

829
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:58,304
You don't understand what's Happening Here

830
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,328
Alex

831
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:00,096
I guess

832
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:01,888
He just has to put up a

833
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:06,752
Put Steve saying like I did things going to get inaugurated I think it's to be president

834
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,288
Todd Brown

835
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:10,080
So Alex tries to be a dick

836
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:12,128
Attractive

837
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:13,408
Reclaim some sort of like

838
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:15,712
I don't know Authority in the conversation

839
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:19,040
It doesn't really work and then we find out that Steve also hates Mormon

840
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:20,576
We already knew that

841
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,392
Talk to his cuz you're so smart

842
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:25,696
Like I said

843
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:29,024
Tell us then what's what's going on here

844
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:32,352
Telling you right now I said it's

845
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:34,656
Do you understand

846
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:39,520
Indiana Matrix

847
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:42,592
V-neck

848
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:44,384
And he's showing it to you

849
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:45,664
Party

850
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:47,456
McConnell

851
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:48,992
Total wastrel

852
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:50,528
A corrupt individual

853
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:53,088
Mitt Romney Mormon

854
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,136
He reminds me of the days of the

855
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:59,232
It when they slaughtered Christian

856
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:05,888
And I didn't do it what

857
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:16,384
He warned orbit I've got to BECU you wore these must have listened I warned them

858
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,992
You don't want any more massacres on your hands

859
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:22,784
Holyshit Wild

860
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,088
Also interesting to recall vets

861
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:26,368
Steve also said that

862
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:29,184
The pope got arrested like a year ago

863
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:38,400
At the beginning of the first wave Steve claimed Authority was to say I got your audiences been

864
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:39,680
Crawdad homonyms

865
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:42,496
Yeah you're a liar

866
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:45,312
A little bit later Alex realizes that he called the audience

867
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,080
Disgusting

868
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:49,152
Flip your disgusting audience

869
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:51,712
Are you in some people that said disgusting things about

870
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:53,248
The most naughtiest

871
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:57,344
Unfortunately I don't even read most of

872
00:40:58,624 --> 00:40:59,136
Let me be very

873
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:01,440
Frank I'm not interested in what your Aryan

874
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:05,536
I don't really listen to

875
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:11,424
Text Ami on the Shelf Cooling

876
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:16,544
I don't even know who Q is I don't read that nonsense

877
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,312
I have nothing

878
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:19,360
Or anybody else

879
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:22,176
You're the only show I go on

880
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:23,200
This is

881
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:25,248
This is outrageous man

882
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:29,344
There's no point to this

883
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:35,488
Just be me and the only reason you would do this interview if your alley

884
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:36,512
So you can

885
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:38,304
Throw away your baggage on C

886
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:41,632
Well you do that dude recognized that like

887
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:45,728
He does bring up repeatedly that their last interview got a lot of traffic

888
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:52,384
And one where Steve was on with Owen saying that the election was a sting operation

889
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:58,783
I got a lot of traffic and so I think that Alex has that motivation

890
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:00,319
Motivation

891
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:01,087
Cuz of course

892
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:06,719
Yeah it's Alex will take like a little bit of this if it means a couple hundred thousand

893
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:07,999
Views more

894
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:13,119
M-theory

895
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:15,167
Forced Steve to hang up on

896
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:18,495
On you or if you just

897
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:23,103
Steve you're making everything up

898
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:29,503
Steve if you always been a second and I will listen to you

899
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:35,391
Only on the answer the question why are you such a f****** liar Steve Steve you don't give a s*** about what my audience thinks great

900
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:39,743
Why are you such a liar liar get in there

901
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:43,071
And because I was scared do that Steve's with running circles around him

902
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:44,863
You specifically

903
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:46,143
Let's just get this straight

904
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:49,215
If people understand if you were wrong about time are whatever

905
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:50,751
You legitimately thought

906
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:52,031
Propaganda

907
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:56,895
I didn't say you be on the 20th

908
00:42:57,151 --> 00:43:00,735
He will be in the United States

909
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:06,111
He won the election and it's important not to recognize by

910
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:10,719
What is your view on what's going to unfold how long will it take

911
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:11,999
Cialix is just

912
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:13,535
Supplicating

913
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:14,303
What are we doing

914
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:21,727
Trying to find ways in which you can accept the things that Steve is things still the president

915
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:26,079
He's trying to make excuses for Steve Turley

916
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:27,359
Which is wild cuz

917
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:29,407
This is supposed to be like Alex's

918
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:31,711
You were wrong damn how old is he

919
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:32,479
He do this

920
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:33,759
Who is this

921
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:34,527
Possible

922
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:35,551
It's it's

923
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:37,599
It's just I've seen it too many times

924
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:39,647
How can one man never learn

925
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:43,231
Is it busy physically incapable of

926
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:44,255
The active learning

927
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:46,559
It makes you wonder if Steve's not like

928
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:48,351
Independently wealthy in like

929
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:51,167
Paying out

930
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:53,727
There's some Dynamic here that just doesn't make

931
00:43:55,519 --> 00:44:00,127
It's really easy if you just see a couple examples of it be like Alex is dumb and gullible

932
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:01,663
And maybe that is what it

933
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:04,223
It's such an extreme level of like

934
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:08,831
You just get burned by this dude over and over again

935
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:09,855
I'd like Sith

936
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:13,183
Fluoride levels of like you know he's trying to kill you all the time right

937
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:14,719
What are we doing here man

938
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:17,535
So you you're seeing right now the exposure

939
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:18,559
Of the Biden

940
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:19,839
Corrupt

941
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:21,119
Incompetent

942
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:22,655
Government

943
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:25,727
What you're seeing now is the exposure

944
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:29,055
Jima

945
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:29,823
Biden

946
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:31,359
And all his people

947
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:33,151
And what it really is

948
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:34,687
It's not on

949
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:38,527
It's an indictment of a

950
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:40,319
Obama and Brandon

951
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:43,135
Close to the heart of the matter

952
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:44,159
Obama is a

953
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:48,255
Homosexual

954
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:49,535
Nobody

955
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:52,863
The CIA operative and Brandon was his

956
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:53,631
Control off

957
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:55,935
Alright alright okay

958
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:57,983
So instead of

959
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:02,335
Accelerating Steve for being a psychopath

960
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:03,103
Liar

961
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:05,151
He is instead allowing Steve

962
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:06,431
To be a raging big

963
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:12,831
Yeah back whatsoever

964
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:14,367
Yes I agree

965
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:17,951
Although this next Club does get into territory where Alex has a problem

966
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:19,231
And that is Steve is like

967
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:21,791
I love Brian stelter

968
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:23,583
What does your narrative

969
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:24,607
Aren't real

970
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:25,631
Like Alex

971
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:27,935
The two of them were arguing about whether or not the

972
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:28,959
Action was stolen

973
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:32,799
How incompetent

974
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:34,079
We have

975
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:37,151
Michonne in order

976
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:39,455
Extol

977
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:47,903
How do you know they stole the election we are the numbers

978
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:48,671
Coming in

979
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:52,767
Double triple quadruple in Battleground state

980
00:45:58,655 --> 00:45:59,167
Completely

981
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:00,191
I think that's over

982
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:06,335
And you think

983
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:07,359
I am a witch

984
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:09,151
That's why I come on your show

985
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:19,903
They tell me the country

986
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:24,255
Bombs off all of the country

987
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:45,247
Very well they haven't said anything

988
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:53,183
The splc and I play golf on the weekend what are you

989
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:54,463
Talking about

990
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:59,839
You're saying that the sblc did Oklahoma City and they're planning bombings what are you talkin about

991
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:04,447
Also Alex the only people threatening to do bombs in

992
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:07,007
All that stuff we're on your show

993
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:09,567
Associative

994
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:14,175
I think that's really funny because this is not threatening to Alex

995
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:15,199
Except

996
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:15,967
Because

997
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:16,991
Steven

998
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:18,271
Seen as a credible voice

999
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:19,039
It's because of

1000
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:20,575
Alex's action

1001
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:22,111
None of this would be a problem

1002
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:28,767
I except for that Alex can't discount him as a crazy person

1003
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:31,071
Too high so I will have to jump

1004
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:33,119
I know the splc

1005
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:36,447
What election

1006
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:39,007
That's a solid swing I like that response

1007
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:40,287
I like that response

1008
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:41,823
So the election was stolen

1009
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:47,711
What election now we've got a whole new Rico and do a little lunacy

1010
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:49,759
So what does it mean

1011
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:52,063
The devices by which

1012
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:52,831
Steve exert

1013
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:55,647
To control over Alex is flattery of course

1014
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:57,439
And also patronizing

1015
00:47:57,951 --> 00:48:00,511
He treats him like a little baby

1016
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:05,631
But a lot of the flattery is in service of a patronizing Eliza's haircut

1017
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:08,703
Cycle mind

1018
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:13,055
It's a it's a it's a weird it's it's interesting that we start with

1019
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:14,079
Alex being like

1020
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:20,479
My dad told me this when I was younger so I'm going to believe it until I die and then we get cbp's coming in here doing it like

1021
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:26,111
Oh you're a good boy now stop it don't you do that but you're a good boy you're a good boy

1022
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:28,927
Alex knows that

1023
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:30,463
Because

1024
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:35,327
Not in the middle of this interview they start arguing about whether or not Steve is patronizing him

1025
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:37,375
Which is really sad

1026
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:38,143
Just sad

1027
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:39,679
And now here in

1028
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:41,215
Florida we're not listening

1029
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:43,263
Fauci who by the way was

1030
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:45,311
Isn't that interesting

1031
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:46,591
Trump

1032
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:49,663
The New York Times

1033
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:50,687
And the Atlanta

1034
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:56,575
About wearing a mask now you don't wear one nasty with

1035
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:58,879
To match so take it easy Alex

1036
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:00,159
Listen to

1037
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:02,207
What's going on

1038
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:06,047
And what I want to know

1039
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:10,143
Did you actually believe the stuff you're saying and talk show host and people like you

1040
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:11,167
You want to show

1041
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:16,031
Patronising dude I'm 47 years old around the block a hundred times

1042
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:18,335
As you are being serious

1043
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:22,687
What do you want me to say

1044
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:28,319
Exactly

1045
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:29,343
What's happening

1046
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,135
Am I patronizing you

1047
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:34,463
Am I seeing you wrong

1048
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:38,047
I just

1049
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:40,607
This show is f***** up

1050
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:43,935
Like this is supposed to be a show where you talk about

1051
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:44,959
The politic

1052
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:45,727
Fixing the

1053
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:48,799
Workings of the New World Order

1054
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:50,591
Hours of grotesque

1055
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:53,151
Discussions of imaginary

1056
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:55,967
Child abuse fantasies that he has

1057
00:49:56,479 --> 00:50:02,623
Second-hour is a psychodrama with an old man who's been manipulating him for years

1058
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:03,391
Popper right now

1059
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:06,975
It's a little bit. I'm not sure what's going on

1060
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:10,559
I think the second our Alex. He was going to come in and be like

1061
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:11,327
Hey Steve

1062
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:12,863
You f***** up

1063
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:16,703
You know what you get some right you get some wrong answer that could build the next

1064
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:21,567
SpeedFlex truck is still president how do you not

1065
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:26,943
Durag how do you not see this coming because Steve is a wall

1066
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:32,063
He's not somebody that's going to move and he doesn't give a f***

1067
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:35,391
Exertion can you put upon Steve to make him move

1068
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:37,183
Oh you can't come on my show anymore

1069
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:38,719
Clearly I can

1070
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:41,279
And Alex seems to have gotten

1071
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:43,071
That realization

1072
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:44,351
And he starts

1073
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:46,399
Kind of trying to help

1074
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:51,263
Steve make his arguments more I hate him so much still president

1075
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:54,335
At the mara Lago and what-have-you share and

1076
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:55,615
He's going to come back

1077
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:59,455
Which coincidentally is another q narrative

1078
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:05,855
I don't read that stuff from this website this website

1079
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:09,183
This website and this website that I don't read suspiciously

1080
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:14,815
Most of the stuff I say has to do with the things that are popular in Cuba

1081
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:20,447
There's pretending to disagree with Steve

1082
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:23,519
Alex is trying to help make that point

1083
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:24,799
Trump's going to return

1084
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:29,151
He's getting more popular not less that

1085
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:31,455
Actually has credibility with Chantix Chang

1086
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:40,927
Siri is

1087
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:43,999
Watch yourself

1088
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:45,535
Have you asked your mom today

1089
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:48,095
Periods at a Appliance Factory

1090
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:49,375
In the Midwest

1091
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:53,215
I'm still up to Big Pharma

1092
00:51:57,311 --> 00:51:58,335
A while

1093
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:00,383
Is a producer

1094
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:01,151
Roddick

1095
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:03,967
But the middleman

1096
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:09,087
For the rebate that I'm doing punched out the middlemen and reduces costs and the

1097
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:10,623
Money goes back to the beep

1098
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:11,391
People purchasing

1099
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:12,159
The drugs

1100
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:15,231
Do I have a lot of enemies out there this maybe the list

1101
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:16,255
Time you'll see me for awhile

1102
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:20,863
Lot of very very rich enemies but they are not happy with what I'm doing

1103
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:22,143
But I

1104
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:24,703
Figured we have one she has to do it and no other

1105
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:25,727
Going to do what I do

1106
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:27,007
No other president

1107
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:27,775
It would do

1108
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:29,567
Nations

1109
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:30,335
A rebate

1110
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:32,383
Dubai from Other Nation

1111
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:33,407
Much less

1112
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:34,431
Call nobody

1113
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:36,991
And they're a lot of unhappy people

1114
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:41,343
And then he said at the military base before you got on the planet flip my laundry shed

1115
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:42,111
I will

1116
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:45,183
I will be back so so that adds something there

1117
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:49,791
On Trump why are you doing this

1118
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:51,583
Why are you doing this

1119
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:54,911
This is outrageous

1120
00:52:55,167 --> 00:53:01,055
There's no reason to do this you're supposed to disagree with Steve not go out of your way to find clips of prompted

1121
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:02,847
Seem to backup wood

1122
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:05,151
I just

1123
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:06,431
I'm just

1124
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:08,735
Just jangle keys

1125
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:12,575
Is that what we need to do do we have witches been jangling Keys wrong

1126
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:15,647
Has that been a problem is that why the right has been allowed to

1127
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:17,439
Flourished as we haven't found the right

1128
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:19,999
Color of keys to dangle outside of their vision

1129
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:23,327
So they can get distracted instantaneously

1130
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:26,399
I don't know man this is f****** out of

1131
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:28,447
No

1132
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:32,287
You don't let people get away with it

1133
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:34,847
Eclipse

1134
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:39,199
Hear from Steve Zander there's more but these next two are just sort of like

1135
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:42,271
I got lost in the incoherent

1136
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:45,855
Pointlessness of this interview

1137
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:49,183
Interesting to listen to for these social dynamic

1138
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:50,207
Text between these two dudes

1139
00:53:55,327 --> 00:53:58,655
Private show he's ever done he's putting America

1140
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:03,519
He's literally showing you the American show

1141
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:05,055
Which is massive

1142
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:05,823
Corruption

1143
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:10,943
We didn't have it with Bush Senior

1144
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:12,479
We didn't have it with Nixon

1145
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:15,807
Jimmy Carter he was corrupt

1146
00:54:18,111 --> 00:54:21,183
Okay.

1147
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:23,999
Trump means well he cares about the countryside.

1148
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:24,767
How to get us he was

1149
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:26,047
The president that pissed him off

1150
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:27,327
I was there

1151
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:29,375
With almost the whole Lighthouse was gone

1152
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:35,519
The capital

1153
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:39,359
And he literally pointed me and I led the people out I was like oh my God this is really happen

1154
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:40,639
Then we got set up

1155
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:43,455
So just the idea that trumps got all this

1156
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:44,735
. going on

1157
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:46,527
This sounds like a reboot

1158
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:51,391
Politically what you're saying is happening this is destroying by the Democrats worse than ever

1159
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:59,327
Levolor sun to level in Napoleon level

1160
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:04,703
I mean they're destroying us there their they're coming after

1161
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:13,407
Well he's isolated right now

1162
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:17,759
The point is what

1163
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:20,319
That is my question to

1164
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:28,511
That's a good response because that was incoherent it was a whole bunch of different

1165
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:31,071
Spaghetti strands

1166
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:34,655
Yeah I think you might as well just said I'm not going to bail you out on that one

1167
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:35,935
You're going to

1168
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:42,335
You are saying what now

1169
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:46,431
They're talking about being isolated

1170
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:47,711
This goes on

1171
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:48,479
122

1172
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:49,247
Bickering

1173
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:51,807
Trump is like

1174
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:53,855
Mr. spacely in the Jetson

1175
00:55:57,951 --> 00:56:00,767
He needs to be out the public fight and he needs to be

1176
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:10,239
He's totally caught off a bunch of cowardly lawyers down before ever shut up

1177
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:12,799
How do you know he's

1178
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:14,079
Totally cut off

1179
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:15,871
I mean

1180
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:24,831
What is this

1181
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:27,135
Trial

1182
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:30,975
No it's totally fake

1183
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:34,815
Are you understanding Roberts

1184
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:37,887
I think you should go into that Briar Patch and use that to expose them

1185
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:40,447
But he's already

1186
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:42,751
When did you ever hear besides

1187
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:43,519
When I

1188
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:45,823
Said that John Roberts

1189
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:48,895
Supreme Court Justices we've ever had

1190
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:50,431
He's been in

1191
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:53,247
All kinds of

1192
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:54,015
Problems

1193
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:55,039
Adoption

1194
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:57,343
Did you ever hear that

1195
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:01,183
The chief

1196
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:02,975
List of the Supreme Court

1197
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:03,999
Is Sakura

1198
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:06,047
And what day it happened

1199
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:07,327
Chief

1200
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:11,679
Was somebody killed by the way was he remember this

1201
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:12,959
Supreme Court

1202
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:17,823
What are you doing now

1203
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:25,247
You're a f****** liar I can't tell if he's going back to Scalia or if he's

1204
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:26,783
He's talking about like a current

1205
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:28,575
What are they

1206
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:32,159
Ruth Bader Ginsburg

1207
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:38,559
Mega game

1208
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:42,399
Court right now

1209
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:47,775
That's kind of is indicative of how lot of this interview goes

1210
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:49,567
Spike there's just

1211
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:51,359
Two delusional weirdos

1212
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:56,223
But with slightly different delusions that neither is really willing to give up

1213
00:57:56,479 --> 00:57:59,551
Alex's commitment is so much weaker than

1214
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:00,319
Steve's

1215
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:01,599
Answer you find him

1216
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:02,367
I'm coming around

1217
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:03,647
Gods of War

1218
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:10,047
So he'll kill your God now

1219
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:11,071
Yeah I don't I don't care

1220
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:15,935
I don't care if you're arguing about imaginary not then you might care about

1221
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:18,495
They made it back

1222
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:19,775
Bats

1223
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:20,543
They made it back

1224
00:58:21,055 --> 00:58:23,615
Then that is that Steve was correct

1225
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:25,151
He would get a job at info

1226
00:58:25,663 --> 00:58:26,175
Correct

1227
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:28,991
If Steve was not correct you can never come back on again

1228
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:30,527
So the bed is now meaning

1229
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:31,551
Swell

1230
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:33,599
Here's an interesting question

1231
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:36,671
Nothing

1232
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:39,743
Of who is right and who is wrong

1233
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:40,511
Well

1234
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:42,303
Steven sister Trump still president

1235
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:43,071
That's fair

1236
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:44,607
So what happens then

1237
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:47,679
That's a good question thinks he's won this

1238
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:48,447
That is

1239
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:52,799
That is a fascinating conundrum we have found ourselves in

1240
00:58:53,055 --> 00:58:57,407
Suggested middle grounds that I don't think anyone is going to go for

1241
00:59:02,015 --> 00:59:04,063
You did come back on the show so I appreciate

1242
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:10,463
But he eventually hire me.

1243
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:13,535
Only because the show with David

1244
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:20,191
On the other side

1245
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:25,311
Hot show actually

1246
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:29,919
Okay for me to go to break

1247
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:31,199
Little people

1248
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:33,247
That might seem a little people

1249
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:34,783
Time Bandits

1250
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:36,831
What wow

1251
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:38,879
Listen I got to pay some bills

1252
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:45,023
Yes I will I don't know I don't know if I could

1253
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:50,143
Could stop myself from at least two and again to see what David Knight and cbpu show would would be like

1254
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:53,983
I don't know these people personally but I find it

1255
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:56,543
Very difficult to imagine the David wood

1256
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:58,335
Ever agree to that I would love it

1257
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:05,503
He died I don't know if Steve is allowed boorish nonsense Peddler and

1258
01:00:05,759 --> 01:00:06,271
David Knight is a

1259
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:09,599
The quiet stated moron that's why I think David

1260
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:10,879
Do it

1261
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:19,071
I don't know he hasn't he's been out of work for a while we've been out of work for a while sometimes you like I'll take these boring as hell

1262
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:20,863
And we're not into him

1263
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:22,911
That doesn't mean that there isn't an audience

1264
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:25,727
That came along with him he's doing his own show

1265
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:26,751
True on something

1266
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:27,775
Maybe

1267
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:29,055
Shoot I don't f****** know

1268
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:31,103
But I bet he's making something off that

1269
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:32,639
I don't know

1270
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:33,919
And I bet

1271
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:40,831
That Alex gave him some money that is almost certainly some shut up money

1272
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:48,255
I do like the idea of zalak suggesting that he can have a show co-host David

1273
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:49,279
Because

1274
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:53,119
That is a f*** you David Knight huge f*** you to David

1275
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:56,447
That's the only thing it is.

1276
01:00:56,959 --> 01:01:02,079
It is a way of him saying

1277
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:08,479
Everybody knew

1278
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:09,759
I think it's actually

1279
01:01:10,015 --> 01:01:11,039
Steve Sanger East

1280
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:14,367
You going to hire me haha I think that's one of the few moments of weakness

1281
01:01:14,623 --> 01:01:16,927
So you kind of see from Steve it is actually

1282
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:19,231
He seemed interested in that

1283
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:22,047
It's weird how so he really does think he's right

1284
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:24,607
Well yeah or at least he thinks he can Gaslight

1285
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:27,679
Imagine

1286
01:01:28,703 --> 01:01:31,519
Imagine how gullible the employees at Infowars are

1287
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:32,799
If you can trick Alex

1288
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:34,847
Something Wild

1289
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:38,175
I would say you know Steve

1290
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:39,711
Needs

1291
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:40,479
Someone to help him

1292
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:41,247
Turn on

1293
01:01:41,503 --> 01:01:42,015
The Skype

1294
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:46,367
If I were him Mia maybe you would want to get a job at Infowars

1295
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:47,903
The Producers there

1296
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:49,695
That's true

1297
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:50,463
Anyway

1298
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:52,767
Steven the man of many talents

1299
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:53,535
What's

1300
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:56,863
Getting out getting Aldo Moro killed is one of them

1301
01:01:57,375 --> 01:01:58,911
Blind alley really a talent

1302
01:01:59,167 --> 01:02:05,311
He was really good at it

1303
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:08,639
Scale that Alex brings up and that is

1304
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:10,175
Poetry reading

1305
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:16,319
Coffee shops and read poetry in his off time

1306
01:02:20,415 --> 01:02:20,927
He's

1307
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:22,207
Reading poetry

1308
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:23,487
And and

1309
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:30,911
This is a call dependent chaos by Steve

1310
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:32,703
Credit Union

1311
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:45,503
I'm I'm getting

1312
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:04,703
Sun

1313
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:27,487
Lucifer come in what what is this so

1314
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:38,495
Is this a love letter to Lucifer Steve pieczenik are you

1315
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:40,799
For the devil

1316
01:03:43,103 --> 01:03:44,383
No I have the Hartford

1317
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:49,247
Angel

1318
01:03:50,015 --> 01:03:52,319
It's simply NY go on your show

1319
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:54,111
You're the only show I have a go on in

1320
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:55,135
Number one

1321
01:03:55,647 --> 01:03:56,159
Incredible

1322
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:57,183
Intelligence number

1323
01:03:57,439 --> 01:03:58,463
Incredibles

1324
01:03:58,719 --> 01:03:59,487
Sense of humor

1325
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:05,887
Let me let me let me let me translate that for you my religion is f****** with you

1326
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:12,287
The only thing that gets me out of bed in the morning

1327
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:15,359
What I got to do

1328
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:18,431
This is a new poem

1329
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:20,991
A rat done bit my sister Nell

1330
01:04:21,503 --> 01:04:22,783
I think it's

1331
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:24,575
Steve the weird dude

1332
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:26,623
The idea that he's doing poetry readings is

1333
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:27,903
Interesting

1334
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:29,183
Makes perfect sense to me

1335
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:30,975
Emerald sublevel yeah

1336
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:33,535
It's nice that he has hobbies that are harmless

1337
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:36,351
I don't understand

1338
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:37,631
Why Alex

1339
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:38,399
Westwood

1340
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:42,495
Respond to a poem that ends with a Amen to Lucifer

1341
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:44,031
As if it's just a

1342
01:04:44,287 --> 01:04:47,103
The joke when he takes his very very seriously

1343
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:52,223
But anybody else brings up the devil doesn't bring up the devil

1344
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:54,527
The devil I would argue

1345
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:55,295
What's up

1346
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:56,319
After this

1347
01:04:57,343 --> 01:04:58,879
I can't tell if this is a joke

1348
01:04:59,135 --> 01:04:59,903
Or not

1349
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:00,927
All right but Steve

1350
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:04,255
Literally refers to himself as a son of Lucifer

1351
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:05,791
Now as Lucy

1352
01:05:06,047 --> 01:05:07,327
And the son of Lucius

1353
01:05:09,631 --> 01:05:10,399
Kohl's back

1354
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:12,447
When 9/11 occur

1355
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:17,567
Ostracized

1356
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:20,383
Ace of the sexual

1357
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:21,407
Pants

1358
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:23,967
DCI whom I couldn't

1359
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:25,503
Meijer at all I thought he was

1360
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:29,087
Operation

1361
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:31,391
Basically warned me not to do it

1362
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:34,463
I almost guarantee that right after 9/11

1363
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:37,791
Steve was not a high priority

1364
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:41,119
Steve's going to run

1365
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:43,167
Areas between the first and the second

1366
01:05:43,423 --> 01:05:48,031
They were like real quick we got to make sure Steve is out of there

1367
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:54,431
Escapism Steven been waiting to do a coup for no reason

1368
01:05:54,687 --> 01:05:56,479
Now we got something

1369
01:05:57,247 --> 01:05:57,759
I I

1370
01:05:58,015 --> 01:05:59,551
I think he might have been joking but I was

1371
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:03,647
I was blown away that Alex didn't you refer to yourself as a son of Lucifer

1372
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:04,927
Should we be talking

1373
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:06,463
Dan we are Alta

1374
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:13,119
Play the sons of Lucifer Lucifer of course the lightbringer in Michael the the demiurge the two of them

1375
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:14,143
Together without which

1376
01:06:14,399 --> 01:06:15,423
It's none of creation would happen

1377
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:17,215
I find it weird

1378
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:18,239
Okay well that's also

1379
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:21,055
You kind of ends with Alex

1380
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:22,335
Steve

1381
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:23,359
Being buddies

1382
01:06:24,383 --> 01:06:26,943
They're just sort of s*** ago David Knight I hate them both

1383
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:30,783
I'll bring it back

1384
01:06:31,295 --> 01:06:32,063
If you host

1385
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:35,647
David

1386
01:06:37,695 --> 01:06:38,719
An issue

1387
01:06:38,975 --> 01:06:42,303
David neither you or me

1388
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:45,375
All I'm saying is I wanted

1389
01:06:45,631 --> 01:06:47,167
Neosho

1390
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:49,727
Say it to you okay where's my

1391
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:53,311
Opposition

1392
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:04,831
What I thought you said it was a budget plan

1393
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:07,903
That's weird

1394
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:18,143
To take this attack but it's not because I love him very much and I definitely haven't been attacking him this entire time.

1395
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:21,727
Is it seems to be also sort of thinking of David Knight is a Fang

1396
01:07:21,983 --> 01:07:26,847
You know like I'll bring him back or come back

1397
01:07:27,103 --> 01:07:28,639
I will make him dance

1398
01:07:28,895 --> 01:07:30,943
Swith you while

1399
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:31,711
Cannot

1400
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:32,735
I would

1401
01:07:33,503 --> 01:07:34,015
So

1402
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:38,879
So fury like this about wouldn't even insult me if I was David Knight that would have felt

1403
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:40,159
Steve is back

1404
01:07:40,671 --> 01:07:41,695
Wouldn't help me more than

1405
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:45,791
Anything I could have mentioned I probably be considering

1406
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:48,351
Speaking to a lawyer to break my MBA

1407
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:53,471
All right well now it's time to talk about everything I know

1408
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:57,055
Yeah I know you can't do that fired me because this guideline

1409
01:07:57,311 --> 01:07:59,359
And then you called him on it

1410
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:02,687
And then you brought him back and now your buddies again

1411
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:05,247
F*** you I think the problem is

1412
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:06,783
Steve's a good guy

1413
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:13,439
I think you meant what you said I don't think you did it out of meanness or bad that's what my gut tells me

1414
01:08:13,695 --> 01:08:14,975
Toshiba.com

1415
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:16,767
Come back on next week

1416
01:08:17,023 --> 01:08:19,327
We're challenging David in studio

1417
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:32,895
Well that was a powerful interview is going on I don't know what it is but it's crazy the office

1418
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:35,967
Is going on

1419
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:38,015
I don't know I don't know what

1420
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:39,295
Needs to happen other than like

1421
01:08:39,551 --> 01:08:40,319
Permanent dunks

1422
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:41,343
Thank for these two idiots

1423
01:08:41,599 --> 01:08:42,111
There's no

1424
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:44,159
Place that they can be allowed in polite

1425
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:46,975
Society without being a cancer upon the rest of us

1426
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:48,511
Other than in a permanent

1427
01:08:48,767 --> 01:08:49,279
Dunk tank

1428
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:51,839
Where I can throw apples at at Target

1429
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:55,423
I mean I understand what you're saying and I hear I hear you

1430
01:08:56,959 --> 01:08:58,751
I don't under I don't get it

1431
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:00,031
Now

1432
01:09:01,567 --> 01:09:04,639
I can't imagine like I've listened to the show so much

1433
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:05,663
Search for so long

1434
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:06,943
And

1435
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:08,479
Legitimately

1436
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:11,039
There's just a reality

1437
01:09:11,295 --> 01:09:13,343
That is being denied by Steve

1438
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:14,879
And I would have thought that I would

1439
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:17,951
Good stand-up for basic tenants of reality anything

1440
01:09:18,207 --> 01:09:18,719
Anything

1441
01:09:18,975 --> 01:09:23,327
I can't I can't believe this interview went how it did now I've

1442
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:25,119
It's outrageous know I'm Fury

1443
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:27,679
Curious I didn't know what to

1444
01:09:27,935 --> 01:09:34,079
Expect when I heard like Steve's coming in he's got a face the music was like that

1445
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:34,847
With rage

1446
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:35,871
Onida

1447
01:09:36,127 --> 01:09:37,663
Guess Alex's behalf

1448
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:41,247
Alex can't decide whether or not he wants to like

1449
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:43,039
Say Steve is wrong

1450
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:45,855
And push back against his s*** or like

1451
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:46,623
Play clips

1452
01:09:46,879 --> 01:09:50,463
So Trump saying I'm going to be gone for a while to try and help Steve make his argument

1453
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:52,511
Both sides of this fence

1454
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:53,535
And you can't

1455
01:09:53,791 --> 01:09:55,071
Nope nope no sense

1456
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:56,095
One of them is

1457
01:09:57,119 --> 01:09:58,655
Well actually both of them

1458
01:09:58,911 --> 01:09:59,679
F*** it

1459
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:06,335
You want but you're a monster and an idiot I thought there would be a point where Alex would just have to be like Steve we've gone too far

1460
01:10:06,591 --> 01:10:08,639
I wish you the best

1461
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:10,175
Have fun in Florida

1462
01:10:10,431 --> 01:10:11,967
I'm not talking to you anymore

1463
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:15,295
I know we're buddies now

1464
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:20,415
I I just I really makes me wonder like what happened after the Las Vegas shooting

1465
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:22,719
That made Alex stop talking to him

1466
01:10:22,975 --> 01:10:23,487
4

1467
01:10:23,743 --> 01:10:24,767
A good like 6-8 months

1468
01:10:25,023 --> 01:10:26,047
Better legal advice

1469
01:10:26,303 --> 01:10:31,935
Maybe maybe get more to protect then or maybe maybe David night was more of an influence then

1470
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:32,959
Could be

1471
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:34,495
I just

1472
01:10:35,519 --> 01:10:37,567
The judgment

1473
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:39,615
Just lie back a little bit

1474
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:41,407
Snap this is

1475
01:10:42,943 --> 01:10:44,991
You're ready to be speechful

1476
01:10:45,503 --> 01:10:46,783
Because another gas

1477
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:48,063
Call Nelda third hour

1478
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:50,111
And he's a big boy

1479
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:53,439
No

1480
01:10:53,695 --> 01:10:54,463
I don't

1481
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:55,487
I can't hang

1482
01:10:55,743 --> 01:10:58,559
He has Magnus Pangea backhoe

1483
01:10:58,815 --> 01:11:01,887
It's offered to get this antifa person

1484
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:05,215
For Alex to interview

1485
01:11:05,727 --> 01:11:06,751
The fruition of that

1486
01:11:07,007 --> 01:11:10,847
It's not really that interesting outside of saying that like

1487
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:15,967
Alex is clearly down now

1488
01:11:16,991 --> 01:11:19,039
And Magnus is still full of s***

1489
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:22,367
Yeah just having people talking to each other and

1490
01:11:22,623 --> 01:11:23,647
More and more groups kind of

1491
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:24,927
Reaching out and

1492
01:11:27,231 --> 01:11:28,767
Got wind of this and a lot of

1493
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:31,583
Progressive and liberal YouTube channels that have

1494
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:34,655
Talking about hey maybe Unity hey maybe we should work together with

1495
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:35,679
Trump supporters

1496
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:37,983
They've started to get demonetized

1497
01:11:40,543 --> 01:11:42,335
That's really convenient

1498
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:44,127
They're saying the same thing they've been

1499
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:45,919
Saying all last year but the moment they

1500
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:47,455
Try to be like hey maybe we should work

1501
01:11:48,223 --> 01:11:48,735
Porter's maybe we should

1502
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:55,647
The more you guys want Revolution

1503
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:56,927
You don't want a civil war right

1504
01:11:59,743 --> 01:12:00,511
From the very beginning

1505
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:01,279
Wow

1506
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:03,839
Okay what what what

1507
01:12:04,095 --> 01:12:05,887
What's the weather is the Boogaloo meme

1508
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:06,911
Yeah like

1509
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:09,727
Just like oh yeah you don't want you don't want to Civil War okay

1510
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:11,775
Yeah

1511
01:12:12,543 --> 01:12:13,823
Do I wearing a Hawaiian shirt

1512
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:16,127
No don't

1513
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:21,759
The downtown by Igloo on it

1514
01:12:22,015 --> 01:12:22,783
To war

1515
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:24,319
Come on dude these people need

1516
01:12:24,575 --> 01:12:26,367
F****** around

1517
01:12:26,623 --> 01:12:27,135
Out

1518
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:28,159
Unreal

1519
01:12:28,415 --> 01:12:34,559
Need to be honest and that's one of the reasons why these interviews are so weird is because

1520
01:12:34,815 --> 01:12:35,583
There's deceptive

1521
01:12:35,839 --> 01:12:36,351
Business

1522
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:37,119
But there

1523
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:38,655
It's clearly

1524
01:12:39,423 --> 01:12:40,703
Like deceptiveness

1525
01:12:41,215 --> 01:12:42,495
For the target audience

1526
01:12:43,775 --> 01:12:45,823
Deceptive Misfits tailored to Alex's

1527
01:12:46,335 --> 01:12:46,847
Audio

1528
01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:48,639
This is more infomercial

1529
01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:51,967
This is not an interview this isn't

1530
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:53,247
F*****'-a

1531
01:12:55,295 --> 01:12:58,111
New show this is an infomercial for why you should be

1532
01:12:58,367 --> 01:12:59,391
Be cool with the Boogaloo boys

1533
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:03,231
Yeah that's what I'm afraid of is that they want a civil war

1534
01:13:03,487 --> 01:13:05,023
Easier said they don't

1535
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:07,839
Now he doesn't want a civil war

1536
01:13:08,095 --> 01:13:10,143
Does want is a war against

1537
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:10,911
The government

1538
01:13:13,727 --> 01:13:14,751
What about is the Federal

1539
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:18,079
Never a me made or a postmate about

1540
01:13:18,591 --> 01:13:19,359
Going out in

1541
01:13:19,871 --> 01:13:20,383
Fighting Democrat

1542
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:24,991
Information

1543
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:26,015
Has ever been about that

1544
01:13:26,271 --> 01:13:27,039
Everything you always talk

1545
01:13:27,295 --> 01:13:28,063
Talk about is the copper

1546
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:29,343
In particular Thief

1547
01:13:29,599 --> 01:13:30,111
Federal government

1548
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:31,391
But always been the Apollo

1549
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:33,439
So it's never been a civil war

1550
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:36,767
And we've already most of us have stated that if there was some

1551
01:13:37,023 --> 01:13:37,791
Republican vs

1552
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:38,559
The Democrat

1553
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:40,863
Civil Warfare

1554
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:42,911
Participate

1555
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:44,703
Cabins in Into the Woods

1556
01:13:45,983 --> 01:13:46,751
Try to stay out of it

1557
01:13:47,263 --> 01:13:53,407
Go fuc yourself but also wow this is so disingenuous cuz he's pretending that he has this idea of this war

1558
01:13:53,663 --> 01:13:54,943
Against the federal government

1559
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:57,247
As if the majority of the country wouldn't

1560
01:13:57,503 --> 01:13:58,015
Side with

1561
01:13:58,271 --> 01:13:59,551
The government over him

1562
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:06,207
That's the part that is the real imaginary world bulshit that he's trying to pull off

1563
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:10,559
Yeah we don't want to hurt anybody like what about everybody who thinks

1564
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:11,839
The government

1565
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:13,887
Shouldn't be overthrown by force

1566
01:14:14,655 --> 01:14:15,423
Oh well I mean

1567
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:21,823
I've never end up having to hurt

1568
01:14:22,847 --> 01:14:25,407
So what'll happen is all of the people in the Earth

1569
01:14:25,663 --> 01:14:31,039
Obviously I assume that the people who are paid for by or paid by the federal government you know

1570
01:14:31,295 --> 01:14:31,807
There's what

1571
01:14:32,063 --> 01:14:33,855
345 million people

1572
01:14:34,111 --> 01:14:36,415
There's a lot of people that would probably

1573
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:39,487
We join the Boogaloo Bois

1574
01:14:39,743 --> 01:14:40,511
The Federal

1575
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:43,071
Wow

1576
01:14:43,839 --> 01:14:44,863
It's I mean

1577
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:48,703
Usually there's a lot of dissatisfaction with the government there's a lot of people who want

1578
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:51,519
Structural fundamental changes that is not the same

1579
01:14:51,775 --> 01:14:54,591
People who would say like I'll take up arms with you

1580
01:14:54,847 --> 01:14:56,895
Against the federal government

1581
01:14:57,663 --> 01:15:00,479
This is outrageous that is

1582
01:15:01,503 --> 01:15:05,343
The disingenuous framing of what their agenda and the goals are

1583
01:15:05,599 --> 01:15:06,623
So outrageous

1584
01:15:06,879 --> 01:15:08,671
Yep and one of the things that

1585
01:15:08,927 --> 01:15:09,695
Is it seems to

1586
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:12,511
Maybe the real thrust of these PR campaign

1587
01:15:12,767 --> 01:15:14,047
That Magnus is doing

1588
01:15:14,815 --> 01:15:20,959
Is did you want to be a living example in this embodiment of how the media lies about all these group

1589
01:15:21,471 --> 01:15:24,543
And maybe you're getting a different version of those groups than actually exist

1590
01:15:26,335 --> 01:15:27,359
Picking up steam and a

1591
01:15:27,615 --> 01:15:28,127
Particularly like

1592
01:15:28,383 --> 01:15:29,919
People are starting to look into things and starting

1593
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:32,223
The question whether you know they

1594
01:15:33,247 --> 01:15:34,271
False beliefs on all of these

1595
01:15:34,527 --> 01:15:35,551
Different movements or even if

1596
01:15:36,063 --> 01:15:37,087
Didn't have false beliefs

1597
01:15:37,343 --> 01:15:39,391
Their feelings on them were exaggerated

1598
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:41,951
By the media to an extreme to get

1599
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:43,743
Get them to the point where they dehumanized

1600
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:46,303
And I have

1601
01:15:48,607 --> 01:15:49,631
Is Colorado

1602
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:54,239
He's talking to a guy who says that all the Democrats work for Satan

1603
01:15:54,495 --> 01:16:00,639
Yeah I don't I don't know I don't know how to I don't know how to listen to this damn I don't know how to listen

1604
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:07,039
People judge how dare the others are people are both full of

1605
01:16:07,295 --> 01:16:09,855
S*** to each other

1606
01:16:10,111 --> 01:16:11,903
And acting at all

1607
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:14,719
With any kind of

1608
01:16:14,975 --> 01:16:15,999
Decorum

1609
01:16:16,511 --> 01:16:21,887
Navigate reality in the internet era it's very very difficult

1610
01:16:22,143 --> 01:16:23,935
Listening to these two assholes talk

1611
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:24,703
Knowing

1612
01:16:24,959 --> 01:16:26,239
In the back of my mind

1613
01:16:26,495 --> 01:16:27,263
Let no matter what

1614
01:16:27,519 --> 01:16:28,287
These guys are saying

1615
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:30,591
They are dreaming of Watching Me Bleed

1616
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:32,639
That is what they both

1617
01:16:32,895 --> 01:16:33,663
Desire

1618
01:16:33,919 --> 01:16:35,455
Watching me personally

1619
01:16:35,711 --> 01:16:41,343
Bleed to death that's because your blood coming out is not really a pain to you

1620
01:16:41,599 --> 01:16:46,719
It's really more of a demon leaving your body

1621
01:16:47,231 --> 01:16:49,023
More that this guy talks

1622
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:50,303
The more I just

1623
01:16:51,071 --> 01:16:52,607
Like that

1624
01:16:52,863 --> 01:16:56,959
People are hearing that the media lies they've been telling about that's all you're saying is one

1625
01:16:57,215 --> 01:16:58,239
Your b******* is work

1626
01:16:58,751 --> 01:17:03,359
You are doing this in service of Watching Me Bleed

1627
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:04,127

Continuing

1630
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:09,503
West Point and some people

1631
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:12,575
Some people act like they're their opposition is

1632
01:17:12,831 --> 01:17:13,855
Actually literally

1633
01:17:14,111 --> 01:17:14,623
Evil

1634
01:17:15,135 --> 01:17:17,183
Like the person he's talking to right now

1635
01:17:17,951 --> 01:17:19,743
You have people that literally view like

1636
01:17:19,999 --> 01:17:22,047
Everyone in the opposing party as

1637
01:17:22,559 --> 01:17:23,583
Like some evil District

1638
01:17:23,839 --> 01:17:24,351
Parking for staff

1639
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:25,631
Physically removed

1640
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:28,447
Get to that Nacho

1641
01:17:28,703 --> 01:17:29,215
You don't hate

1642
01:17:29,471 --> 01:17:30,239
Your neighbor like that

1643
01:17:30,495 --> 01:17:31,519
As just a regular human

1644
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:33,311
It's totally manufactured

1645
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:34,079
Is totally push

1646
01:17:34,591 --> 01:17:35,103
The media to get

1647
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:39,199
What do you think

1648
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:43,551
Yeah Alex has to Pivot and change the subject as he's talking about

1649
01:17:43,807 --> 01:17:45,087
Exactly what I was

1650
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:47,647
Anything like all this isn't real it's not

1651
01:17:47,903 --> 01:17:54,047
It's not organic it's manufactured by the media that you were talking to me

1652
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:56,095
Before I've said that they are all in service

1653
01:17:56,351 --> 01:17:57,375
Is of the literal Christian

1654
01:17:57,631 --> 01:18:03,775
Are you saying that the other side dehumanizes their opponents because if they do I sue them for intellect

1655
01:18:04,031 --> 01:18:05,311
Will property

1656
01:18:05,567 --> 01:18:08,639
The end result is just

1657
01:18:10,943 --> 01:18:11,711
No I

1658
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:14,527
The media

1659
01:18:14,783 --> 01:18:18,111
Has a vested interest in making

1660
01:18:18,367 --> 01:18:19,647
To the media and their enemies

1661
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:21,183
Do you want these groups to look

1662
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:22,463
Scarier than they are

1663
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:23,487
Right

1664
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:26,047
But to remind you before we listen to this clip

1665
01:18:26,559 --> 01:18:27,583
That Alex Spencer

1666
01:18:28,095 --> 01:18:30,143
Most of the first hour of the show talking

1667
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:32,959
Grotesquely about how his imaginary enemies

1668
01:18:33,471 --> 01:18:35,007
Abuse

1669
01:18:35,263 --> 01:18:37,311
Kill and eat children

1670
01:18:37,567 --> 01:18:40,127
In ways that were so graphic

1671
01:18:40,383 --> 01:18:43,455
And exploitative that I refuse to play them on our show

1672
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:46,015
I'm not defending White supremacists

1673
01:18:46,271 --> 01:18:47,807
Now some of them

1674
01:18:58,559 --> 01:19:01,631
But seems like what we're hearing about each group is not actually what's going on

1675
01:19:02,911 --> 01:19:09,055
Because they intentionally want everyone to look scarier and more dangerous and more evil than they actually are

1676
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:10,847
They don't they don't want you know

1677
01:19:12,639 --> 01:19:13,151
If you go back

1678
01:19:13,407 --> 01:19:13,919
It's very much kind of like

1679
01:19:14,431 --> 01:19:15,199
To Kill a Mockingbird

1680
01:19:15,711 --> 01:19:17,503
Bird Indiana the whole thing with Boo Radley

1681
01:19:18,015 --> 01:19:18,527
They just wanted

1682
01:19:18,783 --> 01:19:21,087
Take someone who might be a little weird or might be wrong

1683
01:19:21,343 --> 01:19:22,879
And they want to make them look

1684
01:19:23,135 --> 01:19:24,671
Look like a demon they want to make

1685
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:29,279
Devil's cancel route

1686
01:19:29,535 --> 01:19:30,559
The KKK

1687
01:19:30,815 --> 01:19:32,607
Black lives matter all at a barbecue

1688
01:19:34,655 --> 01:19:37,471
At the end of it both people befriended that was still people trying to start a fight

1689
01:19:37,983 --> 01:19:40,543
I would guess they would not necessarily

1690
01:19:40,799 --> 01:19:41,567
Befriend

1691
01:19:42,847 --> 01:19:43,871
Yeah

1692
01:19:44,127 --> 01:19:44,639
Yeah

1693
01:19:44,895 --> 01:19:47,199
Yep yep I think we just proved Karma isn't real

1694
01:19:47,967 --> 01:19:54,111
Huh I don't think there's a God I don't think there's any punishment or retribution or Justice in the universe because

1695
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:55,135
Two guys are allowed

1696
01:19:55,391 --> 01:19:55,903
How to speak on air

1697
01:19:56,159 --> 01:20:00,767
There's a part of me that really sincerely Wonder's as I listen to this

1698
01:20:01,023 --> 01:20:01,791
If Magnus

1699
01:20:02,303 --> 01:20:02,815
Wasn't

1700
01:20:03,071 --> 01:20:04,095
Saying these things

1701
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:06,143
As a sort of

1702
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:07,679
Pointed Thing 2 hours

1703
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:10,495
Yeah there's a part of me that wondered

1704
01:20:10,751 --> 01:20:11,263
If

1705
01:20:12,543 --> 01:20:14,080
If he knew that this is what Alex

1706
01:20:14,336 --> 01:20:14,848
Does

1707
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:17,408
And was saying it for that purpose

1708
01:20:19,968 --> 01:20:20,736
It's weird because

1709
01:20:20,992 --> 01:20:21,760
These two guys

1710
01:20:22,528 --> 01:20:23,808
Magnus and Steve

1711
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:26,368
Are both manipulating the s*** out of Alex

1712
01:20:26,624 --> 01:20:28,416
I'm using techniques that Alex

1713
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:30,976
Can't really respond to he doesn't have the wherewithal

1714
01:20:31,232 --> 01:20:31,744
No

1715
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:35,584
And it's interesting to see like the old generation and then the new generation

1716
01:20:36,352 --> 01:20:38,400
Just abusing Alex's

1717
01:20:38,656 --> 01:20:39,168
Dumb dumb

1718
01:20:40,704 --> 01:20:41,472
Use him for all he's worth

1719
01:20:41,728 --> 01:20:43,776
What an idiot

1720
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:48,896
Remember who's going by a pseudonym

1721
01:20:49,152 --> 01:20:52,224
Sure on along with with

1722
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:53,504
Maggie

1723
01:20:54,528 --> 01:20:55,296
Anti-fascist

1724
01:20:55,552 --> 01:20:57,088
And I don't I don't care

1725
01:20:58,368 --> 01:20:58,880
I don't really care

1726
01:20:59,136 --> 01:20:59,648
I agree

1727
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:01,184
What

1728
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:01,952
What

1729
01:21:02,976 --> 01:21:09,120
No actually I just listen to Boogaloo boy lie to my face or even though I know they

1730
01:21:09,376 --> 01:21:09,888
In his heart he wants

1731
01:21:10,144 --> 01:21:10,912
To see me bleed to death

1732
01:21:11,424 --> 01:21:12,704
So I really don't care what the person

1733
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:14,240
I'm sitting next to him says either

1734
01:21:14,496 --> 01:21:20,640
I don't I don't I'm not particularly interested I don't know who this person is they're using a fake name they're wearing a mask

1735
01:21:20,896 --> 01:21:21,664
Ask when they're talking

1736
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:24,736
Oh well then it doesn't need anything at all

1737
01:21:24,992 --> 01:21:28,832
And the stuff that they're saying is like really not very controversial and it doesn't start a fight

1738
01:21:29,088 --> 01:21:30,368
It's just like yeah we're against

1739
01:21:30,624 --> 01:21:33,952
Corporate that corporate world corporations

1740
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:34,976
Whatever

1741
01:21:35,488 --> 01:21:36,512
It's it's very mild

1742
01:21:36,768 --> 01:21:38,560
And Alex doesn't really

1743
01:21:39,328 --> 01:21:40,608
Like take issue with much

1744
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:42,912
I don't know it was just pointing much like

1745
01:21:43,168 --> 01:21:43,680
Steve interview

1746
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:45,728
Alex's finals

1747
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:46,496
Suggestion

1748
01:21:50,848 --> 01:21:51,616
News online

1749
01:21:56,736 --> 01:21:59,552
Cuts to the heart of so much of Alex's politics

1750
01:21:59,808 --> 01:22:00,576
Being meaningless

1751
01:22:01,856 --> 01:22:02,624
He would love to

1752
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:06,208
Sia Summit between the proud boys and antifa because he thinks

1753
01:22:06,464 --> 01:22:06,976
It would go Vive

1754
01:22:12,352 --> 01:22:13,376
How long

1755
01:22:13,632 --> 01:22:14,144
What month

1756
01:22:15,424 --> 01:22:17,216
Mark February what year is

1757
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:22,080
You said it before I finished 21

1758
01:22:22,336 --> 01:22:22,848
Dammit

1759
01:22:24,128 --> 01:22:29,248
How long ago did violent fascist try to overthrow the United States

1760
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:30,272
Couple weeks

1761
01:22:30,528 --> 01:22:31,040
Okay

1762
01:22:31,552 --> 01:22:32,064
Now

1763
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:34,880
I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that the

1764
01:22:35,136 --> 01:22:37,696
People on the right who are saying we should have Summit

1765
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:40,512
Are doing that more for their benefit

1766
01:22:40,768 --> 01:22:41,280
15 hours

1767
01:22:42,048 --> 01:22:43,840
Yeah probably I'm going to go with that

1768
01:22:44,096 --> 01:22:48,704
But even beyond that Alex can only see this through the lens of like what would be

1769
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:50,240
Attention grabber

1770
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:52,032
Steve

1771
01:22:52,288 --> 01:22:53,568
Did you do show with

1772
01:22:53,824 --> 01:22:58,432
With David Knight not because that would bring anything to the world. Because we would get any

1773
01:22:58,688 --> 01:23:01,248
Greater understanding or information out of that dynamic

1774
01:23:01,504 --> 01:23:03,552
Because you guys would fight and it would draw attention

1775
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:04,832
Yeah be great

1776
01:23:05,088 --> 01:23:09,440
Everybody loved it I saw this Boogaloo boys I get interviewed on Jimmy Dore show

1777
01:23:09,696 --> 01:23:13,024
They got a lot of attention so I reached out to him cuz I wanted some of that attention

1778
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:15,328
He personally I've always thought

1779
01:23:15,584 --> 01:23:16,096
That

1780
01:23:16,608 --> 01:23:17,632
The best form of governor

1781
01:23:17,888 --> 01:23:18,400
What happened

1782
01:23:18,656 --> 01:23:20,704
Annnd WWE writers room

1783
01:23:21,216 --> 01:23:23,264
So naturally I assumed

1784
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:25,824
Dictatorship see what happens is

1785
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:29,152
The government should be a giant spectacle

1786
01:23:29,664 --> 01:23:31,456
That never accomplishes anything

1787
01:23:31,712 --> 01:23:35,296
And resets to new narratives every now and again but I don't think I don't

1788
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:38,112
I don't think I took a WWE writers on this I got to get

1789
01:23:38,368 --> 01:23:41,440
Stickman hitting everyone over the head with a stick and saying no

1790
01:23:41,696 --> 01:23:46,304
Oh so you is so that would be very similar to what it is that happened when the

1791
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:47,072
Professional wrestler

1792
01:23:47,328 --> 01:23:47,840
Sling took over the

1793
01:23:48,608 --> 01:23:49,120
Somewhat

1794
01:23:50,912 --> 01:23:52,704
Weavile we come to the end end

1795
01:23:53,472 --> 01:23:54,496
I feel disappointed

1796
01:23:54,752 --> 01:24:00,896
And everybody I feel disappointed in life

1797
01:24:02,176 --> 01:24:02,944
People in the world but

1798
01:24:03,456 --> 01:24:04,736
Everybody that I'm looking at here

1799
01:24:06,016 --> 01:24:08,064
Random antifa person quote on quote

1800
01:24:08,576 --> 01:24:09,088
Magnus

1801
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:10,112
Alex

1802
01:24:10,368 --> 01:24:11,136
Steve pieczenik

1803
01:24:11,392 --> 01:24:13,952
The only person I don't feel all that bad about it Steve Jennings wife

1804
01:24:14,208 --> 01:24:20,096
That's cuz I don't know anything about her and all I do is hear her laugh when I say something

1805
01:24:20,352 --> 01:24:22,656
I'm sure I'm sure if I knew anything about her I would

1806
01:24:22,912 --> 01:24:23,936
I would have some issues

1807
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:24,960
She's just there for the

1808
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:28,288
You know when you get when you get older it's

1809
01:24:28,544 --> 01:24:29,312
You just like being around

1810
01:24:30,848 --> 01:24:31,360
I live alone

1811
01:24:31,616 --> 01:24:34,176
Damn I just wanted more

1812
01:24:35,712 --> 01:24:36,992
But we

1813
01:24:38,016 --> 01:24:39,296
Pieology

1814
01:24:40,064 --> 01:24:41,600
I would like an apology

1815
01:24:42,112 --> 01:24:45,440
I feel like that's not unreasonable to ask I don't think it's unreasonable

1816
01:24:45,696 --> 01:24:47,488
But I don't think we're going to get it because

1817
01:24:48,256 --> 01:24:50,048
We've entered like an event

1818
01:24:52,352 --> 01:24:54,400
It's not even disappointment is disorientation

1819
01:24:55,168 --> 01:25:01,312
Cuz I think on some level this represents a new level of not reality we're living in

1820
01:25:01,568 --> 01:25:07,712
Beyond not reality creating a not reality on top of the not reality that didn't happen not real

1821
01:25:07,968 --> 01:25:11,040
Reality to Infowars and Alex Jones is narratives about the world

1822
01:25:12,064 --> 01:25:13,088
It's one thing to kind of

1823
01:25:13,344 --> 01:25:17,184
Like see like this is Alex trying to maintain that. Reality

1824
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:23,328
Now you have Steve introducing the secondary layer of non reality on top of Alex's non reality

1825
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:27,168
It's disorienting and you would think that Alex would want to fight

1826
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:30,240
To maintain control of his non reality

1827
01:25:30,496 --> 01:25:31,264
But he doesn't

1828
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:33,056
He doesn't seem able to

1829
01:25:33,824 --> 01:25:34,592
Weird

1830
01:25:35,104 --> 01:25:39,712
Yeah I know that's actually my new position my new and major position

1831
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:42,528
I will absolutely Reach Out across the aisle

1832
01:25:42,784 --> 01:25:43,552
When I get an apology

1833
01:25:44,576 --> 01:25:47,392
I would like I will happy to have a happy happy to do that

1834
01:25:48,416 --> 01:25:50,976
