1
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:20,736
Jordan

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for knowledge B

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:01:02,720
Dot-com

5
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:09,120
A little bit about Alex Jones

6
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:11,168
What's up

7
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:17,568
My bright spot today Jordan is I think that I've coined the term you think you coined the term I think so think you've invented

8
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:23,968
I didn't cuz I don't really know exactly how it would be spelled I feel like I could smell it

9
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:24,736
Days Inn

10
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:31,136
Misses other way I also do I checked in with a couple friends

11
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,928
I might

12
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:38,304
What I decided to do the other day was at 1

13
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:41,376
Okay right alright I called it in Munich

14
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:45,728
I've never heard anyone say they like you know that

15
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,008
Take me to night to yourself

16
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:51,616
That might be cleaned

17
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:58,016
I don't know I feel like it's impossible but it hasn't been in some kind of Pop Culture thing a Time

18
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:04,416
I'm stealing this from like it would have been either in like a trendy show like Parks and Rec

19
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:10,816
Comedy show at

20
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:17,216
Before evening is a winner

21
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:24,896
If if in the next two weeks this breaks into the Zeitgeist for real

22
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:28,992
I think you win like I also came up with a pitch

23
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:31,296
For like how this is going to go

24
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:34,368
Like I've come up with this term evening and it's going to go huge

25
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:40,768
It's going to get so popular and then I'm going to rename your comedy show comedy

26
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:42,048
It 2 Fandango

27
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:45,632
Cuz they want to sell tickets post-pandemic Schulich freeway

28
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:47,680
Either way

29
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:53,056
Encourage solo going to the movie and social distancing

30
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:59,456
This is a whole new thing I think this is really going to catch on in like China where the male to female population is

31
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:05,088
I'm so scared there's going to be a lot of movement going Saturday to me

32
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:09,952
I have a problem with no dates

33
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,512
The problem evening I think

34
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:16,608
Been this excited about something I thought of sense

35
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,680
Many years ago I came up with

36
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:21,728
If you are agreeable Gray g

37
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:24,032
Black hair salt and pepper

38
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:26,592
But for a bearded should be called cookies and cream.

39
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:32,224
I thought that was really fun pales in comparison to a winning

40
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,832
Although it could get out of control whatever I go home

41
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:40,416
For Holiday Inn call it a m

42
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,696
Batmobile

43
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,768
Yeah you know what though

44
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,560
Predict what's actually going to happen

45
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:49,120
Is there to ever put this episode out of me to get up

46
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:51,424
Flood of people telling me that this is

47
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:57,824
Coined it I will I will find all of those and block them before they ever get a year

48
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:03,200
There will be a complete Code of Silence around you be offensive line

49
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,736
You created me evening

50
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:08,576
The end. It feels good

51
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,744
I am I'm getting another tattoo

52
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,583

53
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,119
Wednesday very excited

54
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:24,703
It about it that seems fun I've been wanting

55
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,751
To get another one myself today I still am not

56
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,799
Entirely sure if I feel

57
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,079
Get back into the

58
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:35,199
The game the longest stretch since I was 8

59
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:35,967
What are you getting

60
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:41,343
I'm going to close the loop on this thing you know how I got this this whole flower right there

61
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:47,487
I'm on the wrist area I'm going to flip it over I'm going to do the exact same thing on the other side and color that one's in

62
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:48,767
Grayscale

63
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:55,423
Close the loop on it'll make me have a nice little wrist thing

64
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:58,495
Bracelet that bracelet for it

65
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:01,055
Exciting

66
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:06,175
I'm looking forward to seeing how that turns out and also

67
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:07,455
Myself

68
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:13,087
We're going to be The Tech Guys

69
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,111
Undertale

70
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:21,279
So Jordan today over and we're going to do this episode

71
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:27,679
Pop-up last week shortened the end of the Mike Lindell cyber Symposium price.

72
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:32,543
In between the release of our last episode and getting ready for this one

73
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,103
In the world

74
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:41,503
Taliban

75
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,575
Honestly I'm not a hundred percent ready to cover that

76
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:47,391
Into on Friday's episode

77
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,159
I will

78
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,695
No dip into

79
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:52,511
Alex Jones is coverage of all that

80
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:55,327
So today we're going to be looking at

81
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,607
Friday

82
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:57,631
Of of

83
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,911
Of last week

84
00:05:59,167 --> 00:05:59,679
August 3rd

85
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,751
This is the 13th falls apart

86
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:09,151
The end of the road it's a we will also be talking about a special report Alex put out on the 14th on Saturday

87
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:11,455
What happened and I have to say that

88
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,735
This might

89
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,527
Only be

90
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:16,319
An episode because of

91
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:19,135
Maybe I found the best out of context drop

92
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:22,207
That I've ever found in my life

93
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:29,631
Nothing else will release the dentist Montgomery episode

94
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:32,191
Nothing else this out-of-context drive

95
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:34,751
Is worth its weight in gold

96
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:41,151
Before we get to any of this business evening and the comedy gold out of con

97
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:42,943
Text dropping one episode

98
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:48,319
It's an embarrassment of riches

99
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:52,159
No could be at the last cuz I'm going to play is pretty gracious good good

100
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:55,999
But before we do that says say hi to some new walkthrough

101
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:56,767

Very

118
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:50,783
Cause

119
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,879
You know we talked a lot about things like animal rescue jail so I'm sure

120
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,671
Don't you think of

121
00:07:56,927 --> 00:08:01,535
Poor people who live next door to Alex

122
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,303
But you need a big

123
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:04,351
Events there and that's going to come into money

124
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:09,471
Ross who said good fences make good neighbors

125
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:13,823
Neighbors fence fun

126
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,615

00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,015
You're Beautiful song

130
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,551
They're coming for your balls

It's all over your God

132
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,159
Very few people

133
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,439
Pulitzer babies

134
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:32,255
Make it a practice

135
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,023
Calling people

136
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,559
The garbage when they are

137
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,095

138
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:43,263
Thank you very much excited news

139
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,823
Joiner of the

140
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,103
Cult of saline

141
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:49,407
We kind of do, this is interesting

142
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:55,807
Okay family members for Salina Public

Sneaky Bojo

145
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:02,207
Came in with something that is a little bit

146
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,743
Upping the ante

147
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,023
Do we have a star

148
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:11,423

149
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:16,031
Guess what is now it's star in the Leo constellation

00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:16,799
Cloud app

151
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:23,199
2B adelio cat is named the altar of saline for a start

152
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:29,343
That sounds like a Science Fiction made for a star where they like all we got to get to the altar of the lean-to restart civilization

153
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:35,743
Oh my God I would have had a field day with the altar of Celine so now we have a lot of

154
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:37,791
Refugee animals

155
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,071
We have a lot of

156
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,607
Trees

157
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:43,679
And something to keep them warm damned a star

158
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:45,727

I can't over-hype this

162
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,223
It's so good

163
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:58,271
You're fighting for your life

164
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,295
My life

165
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,575

167
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,863
It's too good

168
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,287
My life

169
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:31,295
It should be that easy that easy

170
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,575
Writing jokes

171
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:38,975
Tried to be funny and it's that easy it's just that easy everything that I've ever done trying to

172
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:41,535
Alex saying I'm flirting for my life is pretty funny

173
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:47,935
Really makes it funny as the pause the pause where he's at goddamnit

174
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:49,983
Power through

175
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:55,871
It's too late I just said I'm farting for my life

176
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:01,247
Love it so good

177
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,271
So good

178
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,319
You could do to take

179
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,647
500 something episodes in we have

180
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:10,207

It's just that here is Alex on the 13th

182
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:22,239
Don't want to believe this

183
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:23,775
I want to be wrong

184
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,055
But I'm sorry

185
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:27,103
David Rockefeller the globalist

186
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:33,503
Real world depopulation

187
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,319
Preparing the program

188
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,111
Launch

189
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:38,879
Program

190
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,415
I guess you and your family

191
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:45,535
Broadcast

192
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:52,191
God it's so empty

193
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,215
Yeah

194
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:59,615
Yeah that is now time to declare war on the globalist we've been thousand time

195
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,431
I think in his mind

196
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,455
Since price

197
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:07,551
So we don't need to declare

198
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,319
3 Briar

199
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,599
Sizzla Dawn Of Man

200
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:11,647
I don't

201
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:12,671
Care like

202
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:15,743
I can't imagine anybody in his audience

203
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:18,303
Like listening and being like Oh my God it serious

204
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,351
This time we have to declare war

205
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,911
I think the only time it would be serious if Alex

206
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:25,215
I would take it seriously if Alex

207
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:26,239
Seems like

208
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:27,519
No more blaster

209
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,823
Just get on your knees and die

210
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:30,847
Justin

211
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:37,503
I have done that already we're all dead already

212
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,039
There's just no Escape

213
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:42,111
The only thing he hasn't really done is like

214
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:45,695
It's time to start shooting

215
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:52,095
I mean you know it would be more fun if he was like it's time to do community outreach and like

216
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,119
Build

217
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,655
D.C.'s do that

218
00:12:54,911 --> 00:13:01,055
But the community outreach is promote my video

219
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:06,687
Jimmy Carter and you've got space and money you could just

220
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,711
Bill

221
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,479
You know

222
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:14,623
No get to sell his home to fund a war it is not going to be building anybody else any Hall

223
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:18,975
Do Alex a pre-recorded himself ranting and reading a couple headlines

224
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,791
Samantha the beginning about the first 20 minutes

225
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:25,119
How's the show on Friday the 13th

226
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,911
Spartanburg weather

227
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:33,311
It is pre-recorded so he could have it's pretty funny like he's doing

228
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:36,127
Cinestudio or he's put up a bunch of shelves full of books

229
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:39,711
On the projection screen behind him to make it look like it's a study

230
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:40,991
Oh God

231
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:46,111
So fact that there's a segment that it's a pre-recorded think of Alex on the phone

232
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,391
Is the audio

233
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:52,767
Hahaha but with a picture of a callus on the phone until because they

234
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:53,791
Have accused

235
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,071
Videos

236
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:58,655
And they play seamlessly very clearly

237
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,679
Free produce

238
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:04,031
After that Alex is actually on the phone hosting for a little while

239
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,567
A very short segment

240
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:08,639
And then Owen Shroyer comes in and takes over

241
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:11,199
It's super weird I have no idea what's going on

242
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:13,759
It felt like it was planned

243
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:18,367
Recorded stuff but it also felt like they were scrambling

244
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:20,671
Cuz there's three different versions of Alex

245
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,951
That appear

246
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:23,999
In the first half-hour like

247
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:26,047
It felt like maybe Owen was late

248
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:31,935
Or something I don't know maybe it's like maybe it's like when you get one of those things of chips

249
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:35,519
You know and it's got like laziness got Fritos in

250
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:39,615
And it's got Doritos in it we're just getting a smorgasbord of different options of Alex

251
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:40,639
That's what we're looking for

252
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:41,663
Well it was bad

253
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,967
I would guess

254
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:46,783
I mean if I'm writing the story of what happened

255
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:51,391
I mean who knows what the actual reality of July like to imagine that Alex is really depressed

256
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:54,463
Yeah because discipleship ozio bad real bad

257
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:57,279
Failure to stay home

258
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,559
Smartmove yeah

259
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:02,143
But I don't know either way I'm not listening to a full show of Owen Shroyer

260
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,703
God I would give anything for them to have tried having

261
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,471
Owen

262
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:06,239
Talk to the

263
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:08,031
The pre-recorded phone call

264
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:13,407
Got to be so good I wonder if Owens Florida prison life

265
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:15,967
Anyway we go to Saturday

266
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:17,247
Because Alex put out a

267
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,015
Special Report

268
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:23,391
Special Report on Saturday and this is going to be a little bit of a shorter episode of our show

269
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,159
Just because

270
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:24,927
This is

271
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,719
When is Wednesday first of all

272
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:28,255
Iris Sneaky Snake

273
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,535
Snake episode

274
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,559
And then

275
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,399
That looks didn't come in on

276
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,983
I'm not quite ready to cover the

277
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:41,567
Response Afghanistan no I'm not at all ready

278
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:42,847
I'm

279
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,151
When Trump

280
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,943
Took office on Friday

281
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:48,479
Last week

282
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,247
I

283
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,271
Thought it was

284
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,807
Going to really work out terrible

285
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:54,111
But since Friday

286
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,903
Everything's been going great like

287
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,183
Covid-19

288
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,975
It turns out that was all a hoax

289
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:05,631
Get rid of trump and now he's back so we got rid of that I haven't had to wear a mask at all

290
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:07,423
All since then really great

291
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,959
What else

292
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:09,983
Just

293
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:11,519
Just good news all around since

294
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:14,335
Trump was reinstated on Friday of last week

295
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:16,895
It all went down exactly as

296
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:18,175
People thought

297
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,711
Here's the opening

298
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:20,991
The Saturday

299
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,527
The 14th Pastor 30

300
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:24,831
So

301
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:30,207
The shares

302
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,231
An emergency

303
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:32,767
Saturday

304
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:38,911
David Morris

305
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:43,263
I come with grave news but also goodness

306
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:46,847
Good-news-bad-news

307
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:49,151
Constantly all the time every single

308
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:51,711
F****** moment is good-news-bad-news

309
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:55,295
I was kind of curious this is only like a half hour long

310
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,319
Special report that

311
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:58,623
Even do this

312
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,391
What's

313
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:04,511
The point why is it what is what is so Monumental that you need to come in and of course

314
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,559
Yeah I guess you was trending on Twitter

315
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,351
I got up about 5 for

316
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,119
45s morning

317
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,167
Turn my phone

318
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:15,775
All these text message

319
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,567
You're blowing up on Twitter

320
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:18,847
You're blowing up on Insta

321
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:20,895
Blowing up everywhere

322
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,175
How did you predict

323
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:22,943
Kicked it again

324
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:24,735
And what did I see

325
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,039
I saw this image

326
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,343
Apologize

327
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,159
And I saw 10

328
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,719
And I saw the comments

329
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,511
People saying it's not

330
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,303
Real there's no way it's

331
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,327
Real

332
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:42,399
Other people later found the DHS document Lego no

333
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:44,703
Here's the NBC News it's true

334
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:46,751
Minnesota,

335
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,799
How did Jones do that

336
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:49,823
He's one of them

337
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,151
It's not about defending myself

338
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:53,919
Before I cover this

339
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:55,711
I'm going to

340
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:56,991
It's about

341
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:58,015
People understanding that

342
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,039
You can do everything I know

343
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:02,367
So there's some big news people tweeting about it

344
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,927
I feel like all of those Twitter things that Alex

345
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:06,207
Talking about our stupid

346
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,999
The

347
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:10,303
Someone being like Oh my God it's fake

348
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:14,143
Okay I'll Alex predicted this

349
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,215
Must be one of them

350
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:18,495
Also.

351
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:20,287
All of it all angles are

352
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:24,639
All angles that exists within Alex Jones's

353
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:26,943
Assessment of the side

354
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:27,967
Are dumb

355
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:31,807
There's no reaction that isn't going to be stupid because

356
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:33,855
The fundamental aspect of it is stupid

357
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:36,927
Simply being around it makes you dumber

358
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:41,791
It's fruit of a stupid tree

359
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:42,559
Between Good and Evil

360
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,863
He said what

361
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:47,935
What does DHHS tattoos

362
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:49,215
In June

363
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:52,031
Puppet Biden put out this new report

364
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:56,383
Terrorism strategy

365
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,663
From the Press

366
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:02,271
The number one threat are people that question the election

367
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:04,319
And or people that question lockdown

368
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:06,623
And those people are terrorists

369
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:10,975
The full word

370
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:14,047
I probably covered this

371
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:15,839
200 * 2

372
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:18,655
Obsessed

373
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:25,567
They come out last night on ABC NBC CBS News art

374
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:26,847
Tcnnf

375
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:29,407
And they say

376
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:32,223
Screenshot on the videos right here

377
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,551
Potential Terror threats opposition

378
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,319
The cupboard measure

379
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,111
Claims of Alexa

380
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:38,879
Fraud

381
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,671
Believe Trump can be reinstated

382
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:43,999
911 anniversary and religious house

383
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:50,399
What is even confused himself there

384
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:56,543
Whs put out a bulletin on August 13th I was essentially a warning that becoming. Was one where they can

385
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,591
To be a heightened risk of terrorism in the United

386
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:06,015
Alex is reporting on this and pretending that it's all just by putting a Target on his buddies who are Auntie covid measures and they won't overturn

387
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:06,783
The election

388
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,343
It's actually a little bit more complicated than that

389
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:13,951
The bulletin does discuss Alex's crew and the threat that they compose in terms of quote

390
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:15,743
Grievance based violence

391
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,023
But the picture is broader

392
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:19,583
One of the main element to this bulletin music

393
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:22,399
Concern about the upcoming 20th anniversary of 9/11

394
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:24,703
And the fact that lk2 released

395
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:25,727
Cocottes first

396
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:28,287
English language copy of inspire magazine

397
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,311
Andover for you

398
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,847
Your soul good for them

399
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:37,247
The. This bulletin is covering includes the anniversary of 9/11 as well as a number of religious holidays which is relevant

400
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:39,039
Because the report points out that

401
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:40,575
Many mass casualty domestic

402
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:41,599
Violent attacks

403
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:43,135
Target religious gathering

404
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,927
Thanks and that's something to be aware of us.

405
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:45,695
Country reopen

406
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:52,351
In terms of the stuff Alex that involves Alex's world I honestly think the report pretty accurately sums up the situation

407
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:53,887
Quote

408
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:59,263
There are also continued nonspecific calls for violence on multiple online platforms associated with

409
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:01,311
Domestic violent extremist ideologies

410
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:04,383
4 conspiracy theories on perceived election fraud

411
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,919
And allege reinstatement

412
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:07,967
And responses to anticipated restrict

413
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:09,503
Things relating to the increasing

414
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:10,527
Covid cases

415
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:16,416
This isn't about calling anyone who wants Trump to be president again a terrorist or saying that anyone is opposed to masks

416
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:17,440
There are terrorists

417
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:21,280
It's more about have a level and actors are exploiting those things to advance their agenda

418
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,584
They're sort of wedge

419
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:26,912
Yeah they've infiltrated so many of these

420
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:28,192
Communities that it's

421
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:30,496
Hey you know it's not the anti mask

422
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:32,288
The problem is that the anti Basque

423
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,312
Issue

424
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:34,848
Has been overtaken by Nazi

425
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:43,040
All of the Crystal new age people who have turned anti masking and more violent now are like

426
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:48,928
Well we have to keep an eye out for the crystal people is like the crystal people have been fine it's at the Nazis info

427
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:51,488
People traded those Crystal people and now they're terrified

428
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:55,584
It's not it yet and what it is is it's the miac report all over it

429
00:21:56,096 --> 00:22:00,192
It's just the exact same intentional misrepresentation of

430
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,728
Summer

431
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:03,008
People who pose a threat

432
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:04,032
For domestic violence

433
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:05,824
Exist within this community

434
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,408
Being presented as this community is entirely terrorist

435
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:10,688
And that's just

436
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,552
You know that that's the game that he's playing and it have you seen it play out over and over again

437
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:16,576
Cheryl's

438
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:17,600
Yeah it works

439
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:22,720
Well yeah if you they had enough successfully mobilize against the miac report 3020 years ago

440
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:24,256
Maybe we wouldn't be

441
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:27,840
We are right now it's it's a very simple

442
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:30,400
Fallacy

443
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,936
That you can get people

444
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:32,704
Go to accept

445
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,472
Pretty easily

446
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:39,872
What's going on here so that the new version of Alex's right

447
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:41,152
Which is excited him so much

448
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:42,944
This morning but he decided he had to

449
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,224
Special Report

450
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,248
DHHS

451
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,016
Report says

452
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,040
Is water wet

453
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,208
Newscast

454
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:56,512
She found the actual

455
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:57,280
Homeland

456
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:58,560
Security bulletins

457
00:22:59,328 --> 00:22:59,840
Put on screen

458
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,168
Were they go into more detail and they say

459
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:06,752
Terrorist for putting out the dish info

460
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:09,568
That lockdowns are bad

461
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,360
Emmett mask

462
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,128
Don't work

463
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:16,992
So they can recruit people to blow stuff up

464
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:18,016
Don't listen

465
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,064
I just want their money

466
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,088
Sherlock Holmes

467
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,112
Character

468
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:22,880
He says

469
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:27,744
His assistant Watson

470
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:29,280
Deduction my dear w

471
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:31,840
It's Elementary my dear Watson

472
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,168
Obviously when they said two months ago

473
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:36,704
If you oppose future lockdown

474
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:38,240
You're a terrorist

475
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:39,008
Preparing

476
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:42,336
That's obvious right

477
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:43,360
No

478
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:44,128
No

479
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:45,664
Very much anel

480
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,736
You don't just get to say something's obviously

481
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:55,392
I will accept this is dumb

482
00:23:55,904 --> 00:24:00,000
Like let's say that more people you know back in 20

483
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:04,352
15 black Alex and Larry Nichols they were concerned about Obama

484
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:07,424
Revealing that he was a secret Muslim

485
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,752
But he was going to stay president for Everton United States at 2

486
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:12,032
A caliphate

487
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,056
Now what city

488
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:14,592
Bunch of people

489
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:16,384
Took on that that's ordered

490
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,664
Conspiracy theory has started

491
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,944
Did the mobilizing Maybe

492
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,712
Some folks

493
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,760
Took over the capitol

494
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,832
You know it maybe

495
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,672
The intelligence agencies are DHS might put out

496
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:29,696
Some kind of warning

497
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:30,720
Better

498
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:33,280
Hey some people believe that Obama is going to start

499
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:34,048
The caliphate

500
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:40,448
These people have of maybe a potential Terror threat

501
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:43,008
Obama is about to launch a caliphate

502
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:43,776
No

503
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:48,384
You know I think this is a situation where somebody who's really good at it

504
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,920
Explaining causal links

505
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:52,480
Could be invaluable right

506
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:59,136
You know what I'm saying nobody was a real grasp of a happy day if you go outside

507
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:05,536
And the sun is out there you will get a sunburn f*** you man that's you came up with that example

508
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:11,936
Because I got a thumper in the other day

509
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:18,336
I don't keep things in my brain on a hand they just show up when I made that was an attack on me and it's not an attack on

510
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:21,152
Yeah I just I just think that this is stupid

511
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:22,688
I mean like that this is a

512
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:23,968
Pretty basic

513
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:26,784
I think this is how Alex thinks

514
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,320
And that to me is

515
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:29,600
Is a real problem

516
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:34,464
Whatever anybody could be warning about is

517
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:39,328
Actually secretly them telling you what they're going to do

518
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,936
And that way if you fight against them your Prius preemptively labeled

519
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,520
That's just dumb

520
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:49,824
And now what the bad guy does of course

521
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,384
Is tell other people that

522
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:58,528
The other people are doing what they're doing in order to justify what they're doing against the other people

523
00:25:58,784 --> 00:25:59,808
Divide the other people not act

524
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:03,392
What will be my aquaport again

525
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:08,256
All over again Nouveau my Akrapovic whatever

526
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:12,096
Doing biak report.

527
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:13,632
Myactivity Street

528
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:20,800
Not bad but it didn't include any french so

529
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:22,592
You're not wrong

530
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:27,200
I think this is all flimsy and the guy was going to take him the day off

531
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:30,528
New plane coming in to do a

532
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:31,808
Special report about this

533
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:33,856
But

534
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:40,256
I was right about everything I'll be here for the next half hour

535
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,024
Tower commercial

536
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,560
But huh

537
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:46,912
Resume content makes Dan and that's where we're trying to take that meat off the bone

538
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:50,752
I need to ask you this question because you are somebody who

539
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:55,616
It is taking a lot of involves content you understand some of the

540
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:56,896
The story is your

541
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:59,200
What do you is

542
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,480
The plan

543
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:02,016
For depopulation

544
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:04,832
Like what how does it actually work

545
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:08,672
What is the mechanism by which people will be depopulated

546
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:12,512
So first thing I'm going to do is get rid of the most obvious question which is

547
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:13,280
Which way

548
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:14,816
Because

549
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:16,864
Alex's elucidated Soma

550
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,400
How many different possible ways

551
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:19,680
Does that mean are you kind of

552
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:21,472
Kind of hit the nail on the head there

553
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:27,104
My ears my like overarching single single idea of what Alice

554
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,128
Truly

555
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,408
Kind of like ghosts

556
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:30,688
Dolphins

557
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:35,296
Which is reproducing Alex Turner I'm trying I'm doing my best channeling

558
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:38,880
I do not need to do funny voices you could

559
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:40,672
I could

560
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:48,352
The globalists are releasing a soft kill agent that will kill 80% of the population

561
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:51,680
Shouldn't the rest of which they will use as Serfs

562
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:54,496
In order to maintain their lifestyle

563
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:57,312
And that's my

564
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:59,360
General gist

565
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:03,456
I understand that but you actually even different angle that I was intent

566
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:04,992
What is

567
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:08,320
So it's the soft kill weapon

568
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:12,416
What's the vaccine tonight it'll kill people off or possibly

569
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:16,000
Makeup unable to reproduce

570
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:18,304
And do we have a new one.

571
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,352
Now I don't just need doing

572
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:21,120
Engaged

573
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:21,888
Deduction

574
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,168
Also engaged

575
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:23,936
Criminology

576
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:26,496
I've studied the globalist and their white paint

577
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:27,520
What they said what

578
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,056
An operation

579
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:29,824
Lockstep

580
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:31,616
Literally hundreds of other

581
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:32,896
What about animals

582
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:34,432
Prestigious organization

583
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,832
They're going to use the threat of a virus to bring in World Government World ID

584
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,112
The track-and-trace will

585
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:42,880
You do too

586
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:44,160
Cut your resources off

587
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:46,976
You so poor you can't afford to have children

588
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:48,256
Repopulate the planet

589
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,280
So now it's

590
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:53,376
Already so far we can't have enough children

591
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:56,192
They don't need to the rug Ruby the virus

592
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:05,664
Yeah it's so now apparently it's impoverishment to make it so you can't afford to have kids

593
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:11,296
They started capitalism up again about $80 in the eighties and now we're all f*****

594
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:17,184
I just find this to be difficult to square with all the other things I constantly hear and fear mongering about

595
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:19,232
I don't know why this is the plan

596
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:26,912
I mean was the plan Reagan closing mental health hospitals or let's say Reagan allowing a virus to go unchallenged

597
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:33,312
Check through a specific minority Community or any number of different possible ways

598
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:35,360
Exactly what it is

599
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:40,480
It's so tiring

600
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:41,504
It's really tough

601
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,784
2

602
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:46,112
Try to maintain some semblance of reality

603
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:49,184
In such a constantly nebulous

604
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:55,584
Fake space people in order to make them

605
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:58,144
I think I would break Union

606
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:03,520
I think my main goal would be to break and Airport Union

607
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:08,384
Birthday reggae

608
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,920
Well we may have some agree

609
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:11,456
There

610
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,224
Coming now

611
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:14,016
2 + 2 equals

612
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:17,088
They're getting ready to Stage major

613
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:17,856
False flag.

614
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:19,648
Magistrate

615
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,464
The blame those of us

616
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:23,744
24 sanakya

617
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:25,536
Against new lockdown

618
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:26,816
And that are against me

619
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:27,840
Not essential

620
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:33,984
Incredible Tarot

621
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:36,544
This country

622
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:43,968
I think Alex just kind of recognizes that the folks on his side have reached a fever pitch

623
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:45,760
And there's also the

624
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:46,528
Amen

625
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:49,856
Disappointment of Mike lindell's stupid cyber symposium

626
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:51,392
The

627
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:53,696
Hopes

628
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:55,232
Did some people had

629
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:58,048
The Trump is going to be put back into office

630
00:30:58,304 --> 00:30:59,072
Has been dashed

631
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:00,096
Yeah

632
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:04,192
There's a lot of people who are probably desperate

633
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:05,472
And disappointed

634
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:06,240
And that

635
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:07,776
Tim could bind to

636
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:10,848
Something pretty violent

637
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:11,872
A good

638
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:13,408
Lead to a cataclysmic

639
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:15,712
Cataclysmic that's overly dramatic

640
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:19,040
Some kind of

641
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:20,064
Terrorism in today

642
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:24,672
Sure Alex recognizes that because

643
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:26,464
He and his Goons

644
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:28,256
His

645
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:32,608
Not boss Mike Lindell

646
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:35,424
Have gotten people into an emotional state where

647
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:37,728
This kind of thing is more likely and

648
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:38,496
Now then

649
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:39,264
Need to

650
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,032
Shore up

651
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:42,336
Any possibility that they could be blamed for

652
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:43,872
Yeah I mean it's

653
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:44,640
It's like

654
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:46,688
Hey we spent the last

655
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:47,968
2 years

656
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:49,760
Blowing up all these balloons

657
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:51,040
Another full

658
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:54,624
And some of them are going to deflate and some of them are going to

659
00:31:55,136 --> 00:32:00,512
And I Mike lindell's Symposium has made a lot deflate and it's going to make some pop

660
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:02,816
And so that's what Alex is respond

661
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:03,840
Yep yep

662
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:06,144
So the CDC has some plan

663
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:08,448
Berryville AR

664
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:14,592
Official CDC document we covered last Monday

665
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:17,920
Is actively discussing the possible necessity

666
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:20,992
Of shielding high-risk individuals

667
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:22,528
By putting them in Corinth

668
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:23,808
Azure green

669
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:25,088
What say that again

670
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:27,648
People that aren't sick

671
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:30,720
But that might get sick

672
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:32,512
Being put in Camp

673
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:34,816
Whenever Alex has let's say it again

674
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:39,168
I just think of Cisco

675
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,312
I wish

676
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:47,616
God I wish Alex would come in with his head

677
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:50,944
Just like spray painted silver what day of the Great

678
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:52,224
So

679
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,064
This was something that got some traction because Candace Owens tweeted about it

680
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:00,672
Media went out it's making up stories about how everyone

681
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:01,952
The right-wing was going to be

682
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:03,488
Vindicated

683
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:04,256
Oh

684
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:08,352
Osher Holocaust Museum ya think it's offensively

685
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:09,376
Doing this

686
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:14,240
Nothing comparing this to the Holocaust did Nazis know we were right

687
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:16,032
They're going to put us in Camp the whole time

688
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,616
Unfortunately the actual document isn't about any of that stuff not surprised

689
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:23,712
It's a discussion from last July about how do you know when they're outbreak

690
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:26,016
People who live in places like refugee camps or

691
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:27,040
Particularly vulnerable

692
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:30,112
Due to compact living conditions and I levels of interaction

693
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:31,392
Between people

694
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:33,440
This document is about

695
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:39,072
Strategies that could be employed with an already existing refugee camps and areas housing displaced persons

696
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:43,424
And how in that setting it could be wise to separate high and low risk population

697
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,960
In order to offer is much for

698
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:46,240
I can put them as possible

699
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:51,872
It was an attempt on the part of the CDC to explore ways to best protect vulnerable populations

700
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:57,760
Soon only make sense of his taken by malevolent liars and turned it to secretly being a plot against them

701
00:33:58,784 --> 00:33:59,296
It's amazing

702
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:00,064
Yeah

703
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:00,832
Cheese

704
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:02,112
Yep what a bunch of

705
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:05,184
And the CDC to f*** you

706
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:06,720
Q

707
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:10,304
You didn't put prisons in there just let B they're letting people in prison

708
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,096
Do the same f****** s*** I hate

709
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:16,192
You know what I bet I bet their prisons would be something that would be

710
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:16,960
I mean it

711
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:21,056
Anna and a good world

712
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:21,824
To be taken

713
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:26,688
But maybe that was a baby that's the focus of a different

714
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:29,504
Group within the CDC to study that

715
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,576
I do think that

716
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:34,112
To residential patterns

717
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,440
That exists within prisons and within Refugee communities

718
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:39,488
Rrr different

719
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,512
But different

720
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:43,328
I could see you in some things not being

721
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,400
Totally over laughable Interpol report

722
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:48,448
Is

723
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:49,216
Is very fair

724
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,776
Not enough consideration being taken

725
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:54,336
Tzatziki prisoners

726
00:34:58,176 --> 00:35:00,480
Another thing that I would Springs up a bit is

727
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:03,552
Is there some applications that are being seen

728
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:06,880
That there is some potential IQ drop

729
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:07,904
It's being seen

730
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,952
In children that are born

731
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:11,744
During the pandemic

732
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,792
During the lockdown

733
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:17,376
And one of the there's a lot of conversation about what could

734
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:18,144
Could possibly

735
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:24,544
Account for this and some of it is probably down to socialization some of it is down to

736
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,080
Stresses and

737
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:32,224
Things that are experienced in utero also I don't think there's enough information on this

738
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:33,248
To really

739
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:34,016
Bully

740
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:35,040
Discuss it

741
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:36,576
And I don't

742
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:37,856
Don't know exactly

743
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:40,928
How accurately measure this is of

744
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,488
What is going to be the experience of these

745
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:45,536
Is children Isaiah's weight

746
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:46,816
You're older and so

747
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:48,608
So Alex is saying that like

748
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:50,656
Wearing masks caused a giant

749
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:52,448
Dropping IQ in all this

750
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:53,728
There is

751
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:55,264
Some

752
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,544
Information

753
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:58,592
Goes into that

754
00:35:58,848 --> 00:35:59,616
It doesn't

755
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:01,920
It's not appropriate to save the masks

756
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:02,944
For causing that

757
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:07,552
Is an underlying real story but I don't think it's possible to know enough

758
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:10,112
To really discuss it so I'm leaving it alone

759
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:11,136
But I want I wanted to

760
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:13,952
Pointed out as like I'm not ignoring it entirely

761
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:15,232
It's just I don't think that

762
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:18,560
I don't think it's something that we can have a full discussion of outside of

763
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:19,840
Hey this is this is

764
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:21,120
This is an interesting

765
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:25,984
I think to be aware of about that and

766
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,008
That's a very

767
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:31,104
Yeah that's an interesting study and I think it would be a good idea to follow

768
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:37,248
Children born during the pandemic until they're 25 or whatever cuz it's not like we

769
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:40,832
This type of time in quarantine

770
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:41,856
Before

771
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:43,648
It's not like we have a large

772
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:46,208
Dataset of like

773
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:52,608
These are the children of born in a pandemic in This Is How They mature differently than other thing so I think it's a very

774
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:53,888
Valuable thing to study

775
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:56,192
But I'm not going to say that we should draw

776
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:56,960
Conclusion

777
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:03,360
And so I'm I'm leaving that aside for right now

778
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:06,176
Now the varus database

779
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,968
Do you have the vaccine adverse

780
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:08,992
Events

781
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:10,784
CIA database

782
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:11,808
Of course

783
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:12,576
Is a thing

784
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:13,344
Exist

785
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,904
So and does not prove in any way that any of these things were

786
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,952
Caused by the vaccines at all

787
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:20,512
But it is a very important statistic

788
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:21,536
School thing for p

789
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:22,560
People who study

790
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:24,608
Vaccines and study

791
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:27,936
Public Health in order to be able to better

792
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:29,216
I'll provide

793
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:31,008
I think so cause less

794
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:32,032
Adverse effects

795
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:33,568
Information

796
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:35,872
However there is apparently a doctor in Hawaii

797
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,408
A lawyer in Hawaii

798
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:41,504
Causing a second lawsuit

799
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,040
Against

800
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:45,344
I guess vaccine makers because of

801
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,904
Vera's Beto

802
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,208
It's not going to go anywhere now obviously

803
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:52,512
And I'm only playing this clip just because I think it's

804
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:54,560
There's a really important

805
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:56,352
Huge lawsuit

806
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:57,888
Hawaii attorney who's

807
00:37:58,144 --> 00:37:59,424
The top lawyer of Learning Ally

808
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:01,216
Just coming back season

809
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:03,520
Killed nearly 45,000 Americans

810
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:05,312
Courtney his analysis

811
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:06,080
Aver

812
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,920
He's finally a massive class action lawsuit

813
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:12,224
Against it everybody is the top

814
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,808
Everett everyone's the Michael Jordan of

815
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:17,088
Hawaiian lawyers

816
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:20,160
Spell lawyer off

817
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:22,976
It was it's like the Miss America pageant

818
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:29,376
You know America to Miss Universe

819
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,168
The quarterback

820
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:37,568
Like challenge

821
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:41,920
You have to defend someone who clearly guilty

822
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:49,088
You have to solve three cases you have to litigate three cases while doing an Ops

823
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:54,208
It's like American lawyer woman for no reason at all 3 point contest

824
00:38:56,256 --> 00:39:00,096
Yeah I just I find it annoying

825
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:02,656
Everyone is the best

826
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:09,568
This lawyer later find out was the top lawyer

827
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:15,712
Why can't it be somebody who's just like a middle-of-the-road guy who stumbled upon something huge

828
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:18,784
Do you not like that's interesting story

829
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:25,184
The way that Alex does this where everyone is the best lead to me to be very suspicious that some of these people are very not good

830
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:25,952
They're not the bad

831
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:31,072
I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that this lawyer is not the best lawyer in Hawaii probably not now

832
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:34,144
So Alex has been on a long Crusade against fact-checkers

833
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,448
Because he doesn't like it when people very

834
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:39,520
Accurately point out that he's wrong about everything

835
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:40,800
April snow

836
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,592
Is something that has been

837
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:43,616
A constant Target

838
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,712
Now BuzzFeed recently put out

839
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:51,552
Report about the

840
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:55,904
Yeah now this story about that is David mikkelson

841
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,696
Dirico founder of Snopes

842
00:39:57,952 --> 00:40:00,256
He was found to have plagiarized

843
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:01,792
The number of articles

844
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:05,376
And so they ended up having to retract 60 articles

845
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:06,656
From the website

846
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:08,192
And that's

847
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:10,752
But it's not

848
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,312
100% counter

849
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:14,848
Do what snopes is about

850
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:15,616
You don't saying

851
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:17,408
Ethical lapse

852
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:18,688
And certainly

853
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,992
Be consequences and Nicholson.

854
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:22,528
You know that's no good

855
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:23,552
But

856
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:26,112
In terms of fact-checking

857
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:28,160
It doesn't really do

858
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:33,280
Like it it's not like they're making stuff up for stealing content

859
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:35,584
EXO

860
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:37,120
It's not

861
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:38,656
The big dunk that Alex wants

862
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:46,592
He's going to play it as if it it says it's ultimate vindication

863
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:47,872
Snopes and

864
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:49,408
All these other fact-checking

865
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:50,688
Groups run by Bill Gates

866
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:51,968
George Soros and other

867
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:52,992
Media Matters

868
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:55,808
Are going to come out and say none of this is true

869
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:57,344
No one ever died

870
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:59,136
No one ever got sick

871
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:01,184
Joe Biden won by record

872
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:02,464
World

873
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:04,000
Communism

874
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,560
But how many times did I tell you

875
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:08,608
Here it is out of

876
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:09,376
BuzzFeed

877
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:10,400
Snooze itself

878
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:12,448
Attacking their own

879
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:15,776
The co-founder of

880
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:17,312
Plagiarized articles

881
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:18,592
For the fact

882
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:19,616
Checking site

883
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:22,688
That's what he got caught

884
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:24,480
Employees are gone public

885
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:26,016
Say he would order them

886
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:27,552
Adjust plagiarize whole articles

887
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:29,088
And put their names on

888
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,112
And of course

889
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:31,136
She would falsify

890
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:32,928
Much of the information

891
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,208
We already know that about

892
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,768
But here they are

893
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:38,048
Eaten by the wrong

894
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:39,328
A total

895
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:40,864
Fraud

896
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:41,888
And now Snopes

897
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,168
Been so discredited

898
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:45,216
The globalist removing on D'Amore

899
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:45,984
Fancy

900
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:47,008
Fact-checking

901
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:48,800
31

902
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:51,616
Fancy

903
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:56,479
It's just Snopes but wearing a top hat

904
00:41:56,735 --> 00:42:01,599
I would like your finest fact-checking table thank you notes with a monicals.com

905
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:06,463
Yeah I love this the employees have come forward and

906
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:08,511
Said that he forces them to

907
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:10,047
Yeah I plagiarized

908
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:15,679
The other talking point that Alex has very routinely about Snopes as it's just a guy and his cat

909
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:20,799
I think

910
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:22,847
What he accidentally revealed is

911
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:25,151
Such a like crucial

912
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:26,687
Reason to trust

913
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:28,991
Everybody bought him with that far right

914
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:30,015
Infinitely more

915
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:31,551
He describes

916
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:33,087
BuzzFeed

917
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:35,647
Finding out that the co-editor of snow

918
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:38,975
Is the plagiarizer as attacking their own

919
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:40,511
Right and not

920
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:42,047
As quality control

921
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:46,143
Research or Jessica approached

922
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:51,007
Do journalism it's the way that things are supposed to be done and that he thinks of it is attacking

923
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:52,543
Their own just makes

924
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:58,431
If you're in the right-wing media sphere you don't attack your own all of your grips are bulls

925
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:02,271
Yeah and that's why I looks is still on this position of like

926
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:03,295
Hey look

927
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:05,087
Mike Lindell got

928
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:06,879
Taken in by con man

929
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:07,903
Anthony still good

930
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:09,439
You still going to do good

931
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:11,487
Not like the editor of Snopes

932
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:13,791
Not like the co-editor of Snopes

933
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:16,351
Not Meijer the co-founder whatever yeah

934
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:19,423
On the right

935
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:22,239
You don't attack your own until they become

936
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:24,287
I'm so much of a problem

937
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:25,055
Bad

938
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:27,359
Alex doesn't actually operate that way

939
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:29,919
It's people like one back yeah

940
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:36,831
I mean the larger ecosphere the larger ecosystem do kind of does have that like eventually if enough

941
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:39,903
Enough of the Sharks gather around and they're like this person

942
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:40,671
Got to go

943
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:41,951
Then they all

944
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:42,719
Dialogue

945
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:44,767
People are bullying

946
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:46,815
Glenn Beck is certainly in that camp

947
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:49,887
So you just gotta say no to

948
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:50,655
All this stuff

949
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:51,935
Write all the

950
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:53,983
What's good covid rules all the mass

951
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:56,799
You just got to say gnomon Tipper Gore

952
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:06,015
That's right I hate it too Live Crew 2 Live Crew and

953
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:13,695
Denver

954
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:20,095
That's Gallagher Jesus Christ is it I'm pretty sure

955
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:21,631
Weird

956
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:23,935
Anyway you just gotta say no

957
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:25,471
Just say no

958
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:26,239
No

959
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:28,287
And there's too many people

960
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:29,823
I'm not calling for violence

961
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:32,639
States are on false Flags

962
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:34,431
And blame those of us exposing

963
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:35,967
Their violence against us

964
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:36,991
But their lockdown

965
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:38,015
And their tyranny

966
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:39,551
Telling us we're not essential

967
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:42,623
Aw down and bankrupt us

968
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:44,159
SMS suicide

969
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:46,463
Better stop

970
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:50,559
But I don't want to be office of a violin

971
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:51,839
Opposed

972
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:52,863
As victims

973
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:54,399
And an outlaw

974
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:58,239
But know that they're coming with the false flag

975
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:00,543
So yeah

976
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:01,567
Know this

977
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:03,359
If you're listening to this

978
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:06,687
You're probably one of the people going to do one of those false flag

979
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:07,967
I mean the false flag

980
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:10,015
False ones

981
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:15,647
Hey I don't want any violence I'm just saying that they've committed a tons of violence against

982
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:19,487
I have been able to believe they are going to commit violence in our name

983
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:20,255
The in order to

984
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:25,887
To justify more violence against us

985
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:27,423
I mean it seems like not

986
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:28,447
Doing that is

987
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:31,263
Falling into a church giving them the upper hand

988
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:34,335
We have to commit our own violence before they can blame us for it

989
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:35,615
Weird

990
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:42,527
So there's some good news remember at the beginning this Alex out there was good news.

991
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:45,343
Stop say the good news

992
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:47,391
I was out

993
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:48,671
Today

994
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:50,207
Going for a hike

995
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:51,743
Like

996
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:53,023
Middle of nowhere

997
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:54,303
Outside Austin

998
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:56,863
Country Road

999
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:58,399
It's all Xfinity

1000
00:45:58,655 --> 00:45:59,167
They protesting

1001
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:00,959
Globalism

1002
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:02,495
And the great reset

1003
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:08,639
Oh thank God 15 weirdos were protesting in the middle of nowhere are going to make

1004
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:09,407
This

1005
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:10,431
Change

1006
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:11,711
And the New World Order

1007
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:13,503
And then I was driving

1008
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:15,295
Tomorrow office

1009
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:16,063

1010
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:18,111
And I saw more peep

1011
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:20,415
Protesting

1012
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:22,207
The legislature

1013
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:24,255
They want voter ID

1014
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:26,047
So we don't have

1015
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:26,815
Criminals

1016
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:27,839

1018
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:32,959
The good news is I'm seeing Just Right Live

1019
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:34,239
Massive push back in

1020
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:35,519
That's the answer

1021
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:36,287
The globalist

1022
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:37,055
Probing

1023
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:38,847
Testing to see what you'll put up with

1024
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:39,871
And finally

1025
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:44,479

1026
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:45,247

00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:47,807
The work that needs to be done without you

1029
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:49,855
Complaining

1030
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:51,391
We've proven ourselves

1031
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:52,927
We've proven word that on

1032
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:54,719
Proven we do the research

1033
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:55,487

Oh man I saw some

1038
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:08,543
The people on a country road

1039
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:14,943
We're at a voter disenfranchisement

1040
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:15,967
So

1041
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:21,599
Stupid please give me money so I can help keep this up there were 20 people outside yelling

1042

Women's March photos what are you talkin about Soros

1044
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:36,191
When I was younger I would protest

1045
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:39,263
Against the the Iraq War

1046
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:42,847
And my parents certainly even more than I would

1047
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:48,223
Every Wednesday they would go out to the corner of Providence and Stadium. Stadium

1048
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:51,551
Providence is Providence in the goddamn

1049
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:52,575
Get my brother cross street

1050
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:54,879
They would go out there Broadway

1051

Because Broadway in Providence okay we'll go out there every in Columbia Missouri and they honk

1052
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:01,279

00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:29,759
Stevenson

1117
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:34,367
Where is the best way to win the horse you rode in on

1118
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:37,439
Is a nice little thing to throw in a nice little ATM

1119
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:43,839
Don't know why you got all Angry so immediately shorts

1120
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:46,911
What to do I

1121
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:52,543
It's important that you go to my pillow and use my promo code also

1122
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:54,335
F*** you

1123
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:57,407

00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:01,247
How can you the day after

1126
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:04,831
Day after that three-day Symposium be like

1127
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:10,719

You still a sponsor how is there no fall

1129
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:21,983
There's just no fall for the right way because you're already all on Rock bottoms who else is going to sponsor Alex

1130
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:25,567
He's not going to get a promo code at 22 she

1131
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:26,847
Or manscaped

1132
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:30,175
He's not going to he's not going to get one of these on it

1133
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:33,503
Sponsorship

1134
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:39,903
He probably couldn't switch to one of those sex toy ones either Adam and Eve

1135
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:40,671
Steve Cash

1136
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:43,743

1137
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:46,815
Vibrator

Type italics

1139
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:58,079
That would not be a good day one thing about the Infowars we prioritize self-love

1140
00:51:58,335 --> 00:52:01,407
When I say f*** you

1141
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:03,711
I mean you need to go fuc yourself

1142
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:10,111
You could have been a duel at every direction of God

1143
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:14,975
That would be really funny though to imagine like

1144
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:21,631
But you know all these podcast have like you know

1145
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:27,519
Put on a symposium where they tried to overthrow the election

1146
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:28,799
Weather

1147
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:31,615
It was such a disaster ended up Aerosmith

1148
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:34,943
Heaven people still kept advertising

1149
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:41,343
Ceo.of keeps as like here's what I'm going to do I'm going to reveal how we overthrow the Australian

1150
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:44,159
Government and you like what I still don't want to lose my hair

1151
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:45,695
So I guess we'll just keep going

1152
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:49,791
Look I just your check is at don't have another option

1153
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:50,559
If it works

1154
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:51,583
What you going to do

1155
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:54,399
So one thing you might notice there was some swearing at

1156
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:55,423
Little bit of

1157
00:52:56,959 --> 00:53:03,103
And one of the reasons that this is kind of okay is because this is a special report doesn't on the radio

1158
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:03,871
Ugly butt

1159
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:05,407
Still a family

1160
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:07,455
It's Alex does have to Apollo

1161
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:10,271
I apologize for family viewers

1162
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:14,111
When I put this out of the satellite over radio

1163
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:14,879
TV

1164
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:16,415
Proposing a ban. Video

1165
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:17,439
The other day

1166
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:18,207
You know what

1167
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:20,255
Be offended by me saying

1168
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:21,535
Bill Gates

1169
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:28,959
People injecting children with deadly goddamn poison

1170
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:30,495
What you going to do about that

1171
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:32,031
I'm asking you right now

1172
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:33,311
Yeah

1173
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:37,919
I mean that apology went off the rails apology at all

1174
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:42,015
That was it would almost say I would almost argue that was not an apology

1175
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:46,879
I apologize for swearing is a family show but also

1176
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:48,159
Bill Gates

1177
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:52,767
I mean there's a little bit of like

1178
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:54,815
I'm sorry for swearing so much

1179
00:53:55,327 --> 00:53:56,863
But if you don't like my swearing

1180
00:53:58,655 --> 00:54:02,239
That's what it was he Lady Sovereign

1181
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:06,079
He just said like I'd okay for me to do this so you're not apologizing

1182
00:54:06,335 --> 00:54:08,639
If you love me then thank you

1183
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:09,663
