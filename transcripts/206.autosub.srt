1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:02,304
Holding

2
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:10,496
Alexandra Thurston color

3
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:16,896
About that boy Alex Jones

4
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:20,224
Alright

5
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:23,808
I feel like it's a wrap reference but I'm not sure what to do

6
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:25,344
I don't think it is

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,904
You like or it's just a general reference

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,512
I really feel like it's a rap song I'm unaware of

9
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:38,400
Who's the first time

10
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:45,568
I actually remember this I believe

11
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:48,896
Cambridge Massachusetts

12
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:58,112
We moved from

13
00:00:58,368 --> 00:01:02,208
There when I was about

14
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,512
So before that we went to a pool

15
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:06,560
And I remember I was able to

16
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:08,864
First time I was able to jump my head under water

17
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:10,656
His only notable because

18
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:11,936
My parents were proud

19
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:19,616
Is pizza afterwards as a little bit of a reward program

20
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:26,528
Situation where you got into a pool and you put your head underwater grandparents

21
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:35,744
47

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,304
I don't know how much before 7

23
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,328
Most of my life is

24
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,608
Kind of a blur except for like

25
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:47,264
Weird specific memories like that one I mostly only remember that

26
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:49,312
Because my parents had a mess

27
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,080
Pizza Magna

28
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:51,104
On our fridge

29
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,640
Years and years after that

30
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:54,688
And that memory was associate

31
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:56,992
That story about that

32
00:01:58,784 --> 00:01:59,808
But otherwise I have

33
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:02,368
Almost choked to death

34
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,696
Hot dog

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,584
Tried to get my friend Matt to recognize that I was choking

36
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:18,496
Threw myself on a chair it really is more than you know

37
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:21,056
I nearly drowned

38
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:23,104
Champaign Illinois and I didn't know how

39
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,872
How to swim

40
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:25,664
Slipped into the deep end

41
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:27,712
And I was drowning

42
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:32,576
Climbed on top of them like Sylvester

43
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:34,624
Stallone in over the top

44
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:43,584
Congratulations

45
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,984
Where did I know about Alex Jones

46
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,056
Everybody for

47
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,336
We got from my last epoch

48
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:57,920
We were in 2018 we learned that Alex Jones is starting

49
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:04,320
It's new career as a mid-level of multi-level marketing scheme

50
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:05,600
Call Jeanette

51
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:08,928
Great start

52
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:10,464
How much I really want to be in

53
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,744
In the present

54
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,768
Look at that

55
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:19,424
We have just as important of an episode

56
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,240
From 2009 we are back

57
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:25,056
Very excited about what we're going to be going over today

58
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,872
We have to acknowledge that

59
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:34,016
This is like the third time that episode that I have tried to figure out what the name of Legends of the Fall

60
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:40,416
Is it right I think it was like

61
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:45,792
That's just our Rhythm that feels very familiar where I don't want to talk about whatever we can get

62
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:49,888
So I texted the wrong movie Fight Club

63
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:52,704
But it is possible

64
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,032
It's possible

65
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:58,848
Female show

66
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:01,664
Give a shout out to a couple of new donors

67
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:06,272
The idea of us having goals

68
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:09,600
Everybody who

69
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:14,720
And almost 85% of the way to heaven to do another documentary

70
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:17,280
Oh no

71
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:22,655
Sooner than we expect

72
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:33,151
I'd rather not do the Obama Deception but any of the police documentaries are up for grabs

73
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,271
9 hour day is going to be a rough one

74
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:41,855
What is not rough

75
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:43,647
Is

76
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:44,671
Stoners

77
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:51,071

87
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:49,439
YouTube

88
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:54,559
And today

89
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:55,583
Hey look

90
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:01,983
Perfectly clear investigations episode

91
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:04,287
Hey I got sick and tired of listening

92
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,567
March 4th

93
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:10,175
2009

94
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:13,247
I will be the first to admit that

95
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:19,647
Last acknowledged time I've ever done that

96
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:22,719
I live in the beginning will get back to it

97
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:25,791
That was the first time I did that

98
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:30,399
How do I have not gone back and listen to the rest of the episode we would have missed something massive

99
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:32,959
Let's

100
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,031
The few times you've done it before now you just been like

101
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:39,871
We've never gone back

102
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:42,431
I was right.

103
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,967
Chop It Off

104
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:45,759
This is the first time you've been wrong

105
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:53,439
Once every twice a day but I am

106
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,231
Getting back

107
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:58,303
March 4th

108
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:00,351
And getting into what happened at the end

109
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:05,471
Then the rest of the episode will be about March

110
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:06,751
2009

111
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:07,775
Where Alex

112
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:08,799
Does something

113
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:13,919
Fun forever

114
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:14,687
Except for his listener

115
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,271
Super fun for Nick Cannon

116
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:22,879
Width of the

117
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,159
March 4th

118
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:26,719
Alex at the beginning of this episode

119
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:29,279
He had a quip of George Soros admitting that

120
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,047
Mickey head

121
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:32,095
Crash the price of oil intention

122
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,655
I was like

123
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:36,447
I looked in

124
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,471
George soros's

125
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:41,823
Comments about oil around this time disgusting

126
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,847
Who's created with large

127
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:43,871
Due to over

128
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,663
Speculation about the price of oil

129
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,431
And was advised

130
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,199
People to

131
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,479
Work towards

132
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,015
That bubble not bursting

133
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:52,575
Nothing to do with like intent

134
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:54,623
Internally crashing the price of oil

135
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:57,439
So that was just going to be

136
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:59,231
I have this clip

137
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:01,023
I didn't realize at the end of the episode

138
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:01,791
So he would actually

139
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,071
Play the clip

140
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,119
What now

141
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:08,959
Did he doesn't do that it doesn't

142
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:11,519
And wouldn't you know that this is the exact same thing

143
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:14,335
Eclipse

144
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:17,919
Jose is George Soros admitting

145
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,455
But he crashed the price of oil

146
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,735
See if you can

147
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:21,503
Get that

148
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,551
From this clip

149
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,599
More importantly

150
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,647
Figure out what actually is make

151
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,415
Alex Mack

152
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:43,263
Ibank efforts going on in United States for there's so much else to be discussed here because this is after all the world economic Forum looks

153
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,311
About the price of oil

154
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:48,895
What are the implications of $40 oil in your mind

155
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:52,479
Fortunes

156
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:54,527
For the oil producing countries

157
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:58,111
Gulf States

158
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,391
You have a

159
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,415
Quite a few

160
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:02,975
Bopping

161
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,655
And a smile

162
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,935
Adversity

163
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:12,703
However

164
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:17,823
It's not because

165
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,359
Heavy

166
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:22,943
Ulta prevailing valtorta Venezuela urine

167
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,223
Russia

168
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:25,503
And

169
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:28,831
It's not so easy to finance

170
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:31,903
Boulevardia Revolution

171
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,743
Is Chavez

172
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,535
Probably his days are numbered

173
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,071
Andrea Robin

174
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:49,823
And he's

175
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:55,455
He's up for election 09

176
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,503
And an end unless

177
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,039
He can provoke some

178
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,087
Incidental

179
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:03,647
I think that's his life

180
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,671
To also

181
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:06,975
Ptcgo

182
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,791
More reasonable regime

183
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,095
It's more

184
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:12,863
Dumpling

185
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:16,191

Average

192
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,831
To maintain themselves in power

193
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:36,159
And the rulers of the neighboring countries

194
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:38,975
Game controller

195
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,583
Obsessed

196
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:47,423
And and

197
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:50,751
Now

198
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:52,543
Sunday

199
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,079
Financial collapse

200
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,615
Inflation

201
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:57,151
Ruble falling

202
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,711
Leaving Standish

203
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:00,991
And

204
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,527
Danger

205
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:07,135
Adventurous trying to

206
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,415
Have some fun

207
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,695
Adventure

208
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:12,767
Ukraine whatever

209
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:21,983
I'm afraid we have to end it there

210
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:28,639
The clip most Lionel

211
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:33,503
You could characterize that as economic and political analysis

212
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,063
Is based on what the price of oil is

213
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,855
The food was able to

214
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:42,719
Game the system places that are outside of the sphere of

215
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:46,047
George Soros recalled the world order

216
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:49,887
Scares Alex

217
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,727
Because oil has

218
00:11:54,239 --> 00:12:00,383
Rich

219
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:09,343
Relying on the oil speculation driving up the cost of oil

220
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:17,791
L x light

221
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,327
Stu

222
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,191
People like they're doing a good job

223
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:27,519
Which is also something that we've already seen 2019

224
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:29,567
Russia

225
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:35,967
Like that

226
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,783
What is analysis

227
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:39,551
I don't

228
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:45,951
I don't particularly care to get into whether he's right or wrong or anything like that that's not my

229
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,887
Later

230
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,167
Yeah

231
00:12:55,423 --> 00:13:00,031
Not too much longer but not soon enough for nothing the time frame

232
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,823
And then Rush

233
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:07,199
Some exploratory Adventures

234
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:09,247
Nowhere in the Clippers

235
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,039
Anyways

236
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:13,087
I crashed the price of oil

237
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,879
He's saying that there are benefits

238
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,415
Do it come from

239
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,463
These regimes not being able to use

240
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:20,511
The price of oil today

241
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:23,071
But that does not imply in any way they like

242
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:23,839
I did that s***

243
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,911
We did not

244
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,959
Let's remember

245
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:30,239
Along with Putin

246
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:31,519
Venezuela

247
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:32,287
Arawn

248
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:36,127
Alex's dad lost a lot of money

249
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:42,271
So you might have something

250
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,551
Give you please like live any

251
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:47,135
A little bit later and let's see what his analysis focuses on

252
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,671
Does it focus on a rock does it

253
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:57,887
Months before they married in Georgia

254
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,447
Sincerely nineties

255
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:13,759
Because I wanted to

256
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:24,255
Everything you were saying

257
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:30,911
Understand I'm just an ordinary everyday guy like every other man every morning

258
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:34,239
Years ago

259
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:40,383
I had the privilege of living with the elite of the world for three years as a result I've kept in touch with some of them and

260
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:45,759
Hey have kept in touch with me sometimes over these past 35 years

261
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:48,319
They knew in advance Alex

262
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:54,975
I plead with you everybody out in the audience today I think of you please

263
00:14:55,231 --> 00:15:01,375
Listen and believe every word Alex Jones is saying he has tried to tell you for you

264
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:09,055
Williams

265
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:15,455
Presenting this idea that because he was a chaplain

266
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:21,855
We went over him

267
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:31,071
Because also In that clip clearly he has no idea what anybody was and he was just

268
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,351
Rambling on just like

269
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:38,751
Well you know I was around those people and all I can tell you is to listen to what Alex

270
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:45,151
Believe

271
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:45,919
With a guest

272
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:48,479
Power butter Alex

273
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:50,015
Really flattering

274
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:52,319
So you knows that part of the game and God bless

275
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,087
Time for it

276
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,111
But

277
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:56,927
Strategically

278
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,975
Referred someone

279
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:02,047
No I'm for that so Alex

280
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:04,351
Main analysis seems to be about Russia

281
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,655
It seems to be about how

282
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:08,959
8808

283
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:11,263
The the Southwest

284
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,287
Occasion

285
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,359
Attack you

286
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:17,663
He's using

287
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,455
That was a sneak attack against Russia

288
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,479
Territory

289
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:22,783
Ethnic cleansing

290
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,063
Used to be part

291
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,087
The Soviet

292
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,623
Right right

293
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:30,463
Technically it's always will be

294
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:32,767
How much like Texas is a part of Mexico

295
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:36,351
Absolutely

296
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:40,959
Cirrhosis

297
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:41,727
He did this

298
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:44,031
He crashed the price of oil cuz that's nowhere in the clip

299
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:47,359
You getting defensive about the idea that Soros is against Russia

300
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:54,527
Holyshit exactly what we predicted I still don't know

301
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:56,319
If this is enough

302
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,927
With the investigation of window

303
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:01,951
Does he start talking about

304
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,999
Like that

305
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:07,583
Clear-cut case of this is that

306
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:08,863
Figure out like that

307
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:12,703
Cuz he still not saying George Soros is a demon who runs ever

308
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:19,871
Germination of a thought

309
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,407
Did the Russians very clearly

310
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,431
Deanza

311
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:25,503
And the fact that we know Russia is

312
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:28,319
Communicated with Alex Jones

313
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:29,599
Not to the level that

314
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:38,303
Has been an artist

315
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,839
Somebody is able to

316
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,631
And perhaps

317
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:44,191
If you were to out-of-the-blue

318
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,471
Start criticizing

319
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:49,567
George Soros

320
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:52,639
We like it when you criticize George

321
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:54,943
That was good stuff

322
00:17:57,503 --> 00:18:01,599
To speculate

323
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:03,135
Plywood

324
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:07,743
It has a certain narrative reality to it

325
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,279
But we can't cancel

326
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,559
For sure although it is

327
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:11,327
Just fascinating

328
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,911
Where where's thing

329
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:21,567
To him being about George Soros as a demon

330
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:22,847
And stuff like that

331
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,663
We move on now

332
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:29,503
Really bored that I need to really

333
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:30,527
Put a button on this

334
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:35,647
Did they had anything to do with the price of oil

335
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:38,207
Absolutely

336
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:44,863
Doesn't say that at all

337
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:57,663
This country that was previously flush was with cash is now in a depression so the leaders

338
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,735
Presumably are no longer popular

339
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:07,135
Might be kicked out they're going to have more difficult time getting away with the things that they have been getting away with now

340
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,159
Oil revenues

341
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:09,951
They came from a hyper-inflated

342
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:10,719
Price point

343
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:14,047
But it's not exactly like

344
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,583
Mind-blowing analysis

345
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:19,679
Is the price of oil coming down

346
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:22,751
For people to buy gas for their cars

347
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:26,591
Why is Alex so invested in the price of oil being super

348
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:30,943
We're high and therefore more expensive for lunch pail

349
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:33,759
I know he cares about the little man

350
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:37,087
Middle class

351
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:41,183
We move onto the fifth

352
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,719
Alex

353
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:43,999
Coming in

354
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,279
Hot

355
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:49,887
On the 5th

356
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:51,167
Oh s***

357
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:51,935
This is going

358
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,727
Point where Alex

359
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:54,495
Brings

360
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:57,311
Existing 10th Amendment narrative

361
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,079
But he's been

362
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:01,151
Spreading to the last month

363
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:02,943
He's going to have this

364
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:06,015
It's going to sort of mutated

365
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,295
Something

366
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:08,063
Combine

367
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:10,623
The tea party is going on already there

368
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:12,415
Do you know if there's a lot of weirdos

369
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:16,767
Who are starting to come on Fox News Glenn Beck is becoming a little bit more ascend

370
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:23,167
Within that right-wing Community I thought like oh I think he's going to

371
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,191
Okay

372
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:26,239
This is going to start

373
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:31,103
And so when he says this maybe not

374
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:33,919
The beginning of the show

375
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:35,199
I think that's where it's going

376
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:38,527
Usually every 5-6 months or so

377
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:41,855
Prepare yourselves

378
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,903
For this information

379
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:50,303
This information I'm covering to be lost in the overall chatter

380
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:56,959
Pantheon or the Panacea

381
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:59,775
Nope none of those

382
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:02,079
Laurel

383
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:07,199
And still somehow incorrect on all the stores

384
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:18,720
Normally it is every six months to a year that I

385
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,768
The song control

386
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:34,080
And 8 days ago

387
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:35,872
He had the

388
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:39,712
Did FEMA camps are being created

389
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:45,856
Stop got all crazy

390
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:47,648
Because he's talking about the birth

391
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:49,952
Pains and things are accelerating and stuff

392
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:54,560
That's the same language

393
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:59,168
Later with Trump like about the idea of the time is accelerating things

394
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,240
Coming closer together

395
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:09,408
Patriots

396
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:11,456
Uses a language

397
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:12,736
Compartmentalizing

398
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:17,856
Some part of his brain that is only for paperie resurgences like make

399
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:18,624
Maybe This Is It

400
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,160
White supremacist research

401
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:24,512
It's got to be right

402
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:26,816
So

403
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,352
At this point

404
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:29,632
Egoi moves along

405
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,192
And he talks about his own FEMA

406
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:32,960
Camp story

407
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:35,264
In favor of promoting this story

408
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,544
For today

409
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,408
A month ago

410
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:43,712
Nothing

411
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:46,272
This story is nothing

412
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:49,088
Chris

413
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:50,624
Agree

414
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:57,024
Nothing compared

415
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:05,728
The story last night

416
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,848
Upset my stomach

417
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:17,248
First of all I was afraid that I am so mad

418
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:24,928
I do not have an upset instead I am upset with the failures of my body

419
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:28,512
How much acid was produced

420
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:32,352
Because anthropomorphize every spot you can have

421
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:35,680
Because I'm stupid

422
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:54,624
My Palms were sweating I had sweat and my house was cold air conditioner on

423
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,816
It sounds like you had a cold man

424
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:04,352
I mean

425
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:06,912
The flu

426
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:11,264
It sounds like you got a bug or food poisoning any of those exquisite

427
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:17,664
All of those sounds like a slight bug

428
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:20,480
Sleep

429
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:26,880
Is that out yet

430
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,864
Maybe I misinterpreted

431
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:44,800
It's cute

432
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:46,592
And Alex

433
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:50,176
Book the FEMA camp where you were going to be forever forever

434
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:55,808
When the government comes at you in the FEMA camp

435
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:58,624
Nothing right again

436
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:03,744
7

437
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,840
More important than you spending the rest of your life

438
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:09,120
In a camp

439
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:13,216
Well the first thing is

440
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:14,752
Sleep last night I think he needs a nap

441
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:17,824
Kind of teasing

442
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:19,360
What this is about

443
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:22,176
I'll give you a hint

444
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:28,576
Operation

445
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:38,304
Even the target month before

446
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:45,984
I mean Lisa's right around when BioShock 2

447
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,288
Might have been

448
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:50,592
In terms of him taking 911

449
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:53,664
Like it was a regular

450
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,480
So much mileage out of like the fact that he said

451
00:25:56,736 --> 00:26:00,576
They know they're going to attack the Twin Towers it's going to be that long

452
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:05,952
He wasn't nearly the only person who said that that was a very popular prediction

453
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:11,072
I believe the biggest person who said that was

454
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:16,192
What's the time

455
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:19,008
It's one of those things like

456
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:20,800
I can't take away from Alex that he

457
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:22,592
Did say that in advance

458
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:25,920
But I can't take away that it means anything

459
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:28,736
Or that he has some kind of secret information

460
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:29,760
So I don't

461
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:31,552
I don't give him a lot of credit for that

462
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:34,112
And I'm going to give him a lot less credit as we

463
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:38,208
We get into this bio attack

464
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,512
Biotech

465
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:42,816
I don't like to do

466
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:48,704
Alex takes

467
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:51,008
F****** ever to get to the story

468
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:52,544
That I want to recreate that

469
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,336
Experience for our listeners

470
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:59,200
I want them to

471
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,224
Feel

472
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:02,272
The frustration with Alex

473
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,040
That like

474
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:09,184
If you're listening to show we're already you know a couple commercial breaks. This is big news

475
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:10,976
Got s*** on this

476
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:12,768
And then is going out to break

477
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:15,072
But you think

478
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:17,632
Eli car right

479
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:21,216
Talking about

480
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:28,128
Cuz you know what we love to do on our show is make our listeners breast

481
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:34,784
Put Pitino that we will get to it eventually or is he don't know it's Alex

482
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:40,672
Point that's true in Open Water

483
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:50,912
But I'll tell you right now that the news I've gotten

484
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:56,544
Because he doesn't respect information

485
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:57,568
He'll respect

486
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:00,640
To just

487
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,712
Move on

488
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:11,904
Focus on something

489
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:25,472
Over 100 equals

490
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:29,056
Stretch we don't have a PowerPoint out yet

491
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:35,456
Arrow

492
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:49,536
Just the asinine over-the-top macevil

493
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:59,520
Nautical Surplus

494
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:12,576
Grocery

495
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:26,400
On the website and podcast

496
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:30,240
They just keep calling and there's no

497
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:33,568
There's no New World Order none of this is happening everything's fine

498
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:39,456
Anymore

499
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:41,504
Very very sick Society

500
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:45,344
What sectors of our economy and Society

501
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:51,488
Are just really sick evil people

502
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:58,144
So should they are engaged

503
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,032
Tell the story of this magnitude

504
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:05,312
People don't respect

505
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:12,224
Very short

506
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:20,160
People are

507
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:22,464
Spiritually what the f***

508
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:28,096
A gift cuz he's got to get to this news

509
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:30,400
It does it does disrespect

510
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:35,520
Preemptively defend against your dude

511
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:38,080
Take me to

512
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:51,136
The f****** news already

513
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,184
4 hours of

514
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:56,000
Come on

Most of you listening right now this show us around

517
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:08,032
Did your dad

518
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:10,080
Our children are probably going to die

519
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,872
Parents

520
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,136
The vaccine

521
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:26,720
And the first bio-weapon they were

522
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:29,792
Bioweapon

523
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:37,216
100000

524
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:08,448
Cyclone

525
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:27,904
Stunning

526
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:32,768
Around me

527
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:39,168
Again I didn't get the flu I think you got a bug Alex another symptom

528
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:44,800
This is what this is like what he said

529
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:48,384
Forever

530
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:53,760
Tell you what

531
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:56,320
This buck with information

532
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:01,184
So

533
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:03,488
No real

534
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:06,560
Details about what their story is but thankfully

535
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:08,608
You promised he's going to read it on the other side of the

536
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:09,632
Commercial break

537
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:11,168
Break

538
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:12,192
And it comes back

539
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:16,544
He still rambling a bit before he goes

540
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:19,360
T.i. get caught

541
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:20,128
My heart out

542
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:21,408
Commercial

543
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:23,968
This is

544
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:32,160
The most important

545
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:34,208
Story

546
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:36,000
I have ever

547
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:38,304
Covered on this radio show

548
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:44,704
Important

549
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:55,712
This Dwarfs

550
00:33:56,992 --> 00:34:03,136
911 for the police

551
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:07,488
In preparation

552
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:10,304
Bioweapon

553
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:11,328
Got to go break

554
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:15,424
So this is the most important story of his career

555
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,192
What

556
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:17,728
Listen to 1011

557
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,008
Probably yeah

558
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,824
110

559
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,360
Global 911

560
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:25,920
To like it's a 12-mile weapons

561
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:26,944
Going to kill billions

562
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,016
Mega Million Friday night

563
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:32,320
Right right right right right

564
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:34,624
Killed 0

565
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:37,440
But

566
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:39,232
Bingo

567
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:46,656
Bird flu

568
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:50,496
This is wonder what would happen

569
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:52,032
He got a flu

570
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:55,104
What's a bio-weapon

571
00:34:55,616 --> 00:35:01,760
Well it's poor he was inspired by having the flu to be like obviously that's how they're going to kill every

572
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:03,296
I had the flu I could have

573
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:09,184
I don't have medical records on Alex

574
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,488
Description of symptoms

575
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:15,584
They possibly eat suffering from a bug

576
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:20,448
The issue is that there was also a new story that

577
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:22,240
Come out a couple

578
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,008
Before this

579
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,800
That sort of feeds into

580
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:27,104
Alex's

581
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:29,152
He's going to make

582
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:31,200
Disgraceful propaganda

583
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:34,528
I will be able to over the course of this

584
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:36,320
He's getting all of this in

585
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:37,344
Asian from

586
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,112
It's not the place

587
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:38,880
Susie says it's gone

588
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:40,160
Coming from

589
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:41,696
This is this

590
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:42,976
He's so bad

591
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:45,280
I can visit Alex at his

592
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:49,120
We've already seen him build this up

593
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:51,424
This is the most important story I have

594
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,192
Have ever

595
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:53,984
Come on Aaron told you about

596
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:54,752
And

597
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:56,544
When we get to

598
00:35:58,592 --> 00:35:59,872
Let me get to the bottom of it

599
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:00,896
It will be

600
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:03,968
Terrible embarrass

601
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:06,528
It's important

602
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:07,296
But he comes back

603
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:08,832
Brake and he finally gets to

604
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:09,600
To the story

605
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:11,392
And it's interesting

606
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:12,160
Where he's reading

607
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:17,280
Okay what I'm going to do is I'm just going to read this news article

608
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:22,656
And why is she so serious

609
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:28,544
And connect to other

610
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,080
Crystal clear

611
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:44,672
This morning accidental contamination of vaccines live avian flu virus virtually impossible

612
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:50,816
Vaccine scientist

613
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:55,168
Well certainly there's that issue

614
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:56,704
Put that aside for a second

615
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,984
Because the big news

616
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:01,824
He's reading these reading this article this news article

617
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:06,176
That was written by Paul Joseph Watson

618
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,712
And Alex told him to

619
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,040
The nature of

620
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:12,064
Big story

621
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,624
You're reporting on your own ship

622
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:17,696
This is not good

623
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:20,512
Number one

624
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:26,912
What Paul Joseph is reporting on

625
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:28,192
In a little bit

626
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:29,472
But suffice it to say

627
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:30,496
It's not

628
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:32,544
Anyway

629
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:37,152
Little claims that Alex

630
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:38,688
The real

631
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:39,456
Really trouble

632
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:42,528
So much

633
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:43,552
Every time

634
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:45,344
Story with

635
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,368
Paul Joseph Watson

636
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:48,160
And wrote an article about it

637
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,720
Christ why are we doing this

638
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:51,488
Yeah yeah

639
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:52,512
I don't even want to

640
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:54,048
Tertiary

641
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:55,072
Paul Joseph Watson

642
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:59,168
So I guess I guess what I should do up top

643
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,448
It kind of gives you

644
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:03,008
The reality of the story

645
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:04,800
He's telling

646
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:09,152
There was an issue of described as gross mismanagement

647
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,528
Where a company called Baxter Pharmaceuticals Baxter

648
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:18,624
The flu vaccine

649
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,184
And a bunch of chicks

650
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,744
Pigeons

651
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,512
Showed up

652
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:25,280
Save

653
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:27,584
Knocked all the vials of flu on the floor

654
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:29,888
Got the flu and that's where bird flu came

655
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:33,472
Company called biotin

656
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:35,008
Was also involved

657
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:37,568
H 5 n 1

658
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:42,176
It appears they're responsible for a mix-up that happened at this check

659
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:43,712
Not Baxter internet

660
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:47,040
To clean flu virus

661
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:48,320
To the check company Biotest

662
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,088
For research

663
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:51,136
I was replaced by a bird flu virus

664
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:53,184
Replacement of the test material

665
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,000
Does Baxter's wickard Kichler

666
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:56,768
But

667
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:58,560
The problem is slightly more complicated

668
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:00,608
The origination

669
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:03,168
Contamination wasn't even necessary

670
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:03,936
Bald-headed

671
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:08,288
Call Daisy IR

672
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:09,056
Green Hills

673
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:11,104
Who'd hired out a bio test lab

674
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:14,432
Is only occurred during the process for witches

675
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:15,968
Particular research project

676
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:16,992
For a vir

677
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:17,760
Green Hills

678
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:19,296
In Baxter's Laboratory

679
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:21,344
And this specific process will not be

680
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:24,672
So they rented it out for like a

681
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:25,696
Staff birthday

682
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:28,512
Sure if you want to go

683
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:29,792
That far with it

684
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,328
Yeah whatever

685
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:38,752
This is kind of complicated so I'm a little up in my head about laying outside

686
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:42,080
There was a vir Greenhills

687
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:43,872
I was running attack

688
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:44,896
Involved

689
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:45,664
Bird flu

690
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,736
This facility that was over

691
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:49,760
Christine by biotech

692
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:51,040
Biotest

693
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:54,368
International national

694
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:56,416
Flu vaccine

695
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:58,464
This Biotest labs

696
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:00,768
We're avir Greenhills

697
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:02,048
Was also doing

698
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,072
Search on

699
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:04,864
The bird flu

700
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,912
They have some sort of

701
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:07,680
Miss handling

702
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:08,448
Mix up

703
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:09,472
Of some sort

704
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:11,776
Unclear exactly what happened

705
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:16,128
Working Theory as I understand there were some

706
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:20,480
The influence five-in-one that were unlabeled

707
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:21,504
And ended up

708
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,272
Commingling

709
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:24,064
The other stuff

710
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:24,832
That was

711
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:30,208
Plot of every 50s movie where something

712
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:31,488
Turns

713
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:38,144
Yeah it's the plot of every 50s movie where is like the giant woman it was there they went to

714
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:42,240
It has great potential to have gone

715
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:47,616
Fortunately there's some protocols in place

716
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:48,640
End up catching things

717
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:53,248
Ended up being painted

718
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:55,296
They were

719
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:56,832
Testimony

720
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:00,672
Obviously

721
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:06,048
And they're supposed to not have

722
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:07,072
Terrible

723
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:09,632
That is

724
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:10,656
It's not

725
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:17,056
They have a terrible reaction to the alarm

726
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:22,176
Ferret showed negative reaction

727
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:23,712
Kill the ferrets

728
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:24,736
Because

729
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,160
Had already been shipped out to

730
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:32,928
Couple location

731
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:34,464
From this check

732
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:37,024
Until the end up finding it

733
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:39,328
No one ended up getting sick

734
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:40,096
Sick from it

735
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:41,888
The employees of the labs

736
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:42,656
Gotcha

737
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:45,728
Inoculation

738
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:47,776
What's fine

739
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:50,080
Got resolved

740
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,407
Less destructive then when like

741
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:55,711
Grocery store has turkey

742
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:56,479
Recalled lettuce

743
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:57,503
Yeah

744
00:41:58,527 --> 00:42:00,319
But it has such scary pretend

745
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:02,623
Yeah because the idea that

746
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:05,439
Behavior and flu which is not really all that harmful

747
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:07,231
People largely because

748
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:08,255
I understand

749
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:09,791
Copper

750
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:10,559
DiNozzo

751
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:12,351
Of the human is too cold

752
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,399
Generally speaking it dies before

753
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:17,727
Your system

754
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:20,543
Just think that's from an article I read in some scientific journal

755
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:21,567
No entire Lake

756
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:24,639
Humans for the most part are not susceptible to

757
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:26,687
And it's not airborne

758
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:28,735
Saudia

759
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:29,503
Mingle and mute

760
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:31,807
With the normal flu

761
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:36,927
Flu is much more dangerous

762
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:38,975
4 people as much

763
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:39,999
Higher mortality

764
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:45,631
Mingle with a regular flu virus survive

765
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:46,399
Incubate Within

766
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:47,935
The person in order for that

767
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:53,823
Trade on the feet

768
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:54,591
Peers

769
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:58,687
But that idea causes but he's not dealing with the reality of

770
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:00,479
Actually happened

771
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:01,503
I've done

772
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:05,343
You too and it's very,

773
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:09,183
All of this

774
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:12,255
Good luck because it will firmly demonstrate what a propagate

775
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:15,583
Continue with jokes the whole time

776
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:16,351
Fair enough

777
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:21,471
To the actual story

778
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:22,239
Just yet

779
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:28,639
Now this is a

780
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:33,247
The 90%

781
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:36,831
Not true

782
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:38,367
That is not true

783
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:42,207
Cuz we would you get that well because there till 6

784
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:43,743
Percent of the people that get it

785
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:46,559
But you can come in contact with it and not get it

786
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:47,327
Quite easily

787
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:51,679
Trying to mix the idea of

788
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:53,215
Being exposed to it

789
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:54,239
And

790
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:55,263
Having it

791
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:56,031
Invader

792
00:43:59,103 --> 00:43:59,615
Think you might have birth

793
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:06,271
I don't but I do know someone who had

794
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:08,063
They survive

795
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:12,415
Get it

796
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:13,951
Come in contact with it and not get it

797
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:15,487
Alex is trying to muddy the waters

798
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:17,535
Bird flu is

799
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:19,071
Not great

800
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:20,095
So now yours is next

801
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,655
They gave it to ferrets

802
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:25,727
Hammer

803
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:26,751
That's not true

804
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:27,775
They killed the pharaoh

805
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:30,591
Yeah they ended up killing the Pirates when they founded

806
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:32,639
Influence

807
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:33,407
The flu itself

808
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:34,175
Did not kill

809
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:35,455
Would it have

810
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:41,087
Yeah a lot of cuz we saw that they had

811
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:41,855
The symptoms

812
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:46,463
We know that they got the bird flu and because the bird flu has a 6290 /

813
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:47,999
Percent

814
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:48,767
Spray tan

815
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:49,535
On the

816
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:50,559
Thanks

817
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:55,679
They decided to euthanize all of them not what not least of which two

818
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:57,215
Keep them from Justice

819
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:04,639
Physical situation

820
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:06,943
Precaution and all that

821
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:09,759
I'm trying to make it less awful that's awful

822
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:13,855
Testing it on face

823
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:16,927
Life is cheap

824
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:22,559
The reality of what's going on here is

825
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:24,095
An expression of

826
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:25,119
A very

827
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:27,423
Lacking

828
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:29,727
Guidelines

829
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:32,031
There's hope there's a very serious lack

830
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:34,079
Czech Republic

831
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:35,103
Rules

832
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:37,663
Strict guidelines with which these materials

833
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:43,039
That is why that is why this situation happened

834
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:43,807
It's not because

835
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:44,831
Nefarious

836
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:46,623
Create a supervisor

837
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:48,159
Or anything like that

838
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:49,951
It is a lack of oversight

839
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:51,231
Regulation

840
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:52,255
Because this

841
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:53,023
And I know that

842
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:56,095
Set at the comedy of errors

843
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:02,239
So

844
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:04,799
This is a story that broke

845
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:07,103
At the end of February

846
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:09,407
We're now on March 5th

847
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:11,967
Alex is going to say how important

848
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:13,247
Very mad

849
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:21,183
The most important article

850
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:29,119
And I've never said this before this is the most important piece of the puzzle the Tumblers

851
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:35,775
This story itself

852
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:37,567
Many articles

853
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:44,223
Impossible

854
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:46,271
Frozen quotes

855
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:48,319
And that's the name of Paul Joseph Watson

856
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:49,599
Salty's

857
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:51,135
You're not pronouncing the quote

858
00:46:56,511 --> 00:47:00,607
British it's in German

859
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:02,143
Kitchen Chinese

860
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:05,215
English papers as well

861
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:12,127
This story has been out for more than 24 hours I learned of it last night and nothing

862
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:17,759
Play more than 24 hours and there was an article on February 24th about it in Bloomberg

863
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:19,295
Soylent

864
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:24,159
There's nothing about it in America

865
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:25,695
Bloomberg I read the

866
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:27,487
Find it so

867
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:33,631
Recovering things they're not operating on

868
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:34,399
Information

869
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:37,471
He starts trying to read the actual article

870
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:39,519
He doesn't make it far before

871
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:40,799
Restart literally make

872
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:42,847
Like anytime we

873
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:45,151
He's just making s*** up at the end

874
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:51,551
Accidental contamination of virtually impossible

875
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:57,439
Subcontractor

876
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:06,143
Ferrets

877
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:08,959
Supposed to do

878
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:15,103
Guess what

879
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:18,431
It killed the ferrets

880
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:20,223
Vile

881
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:22,015
Biola

882
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:28,671
Vaccines don't need to be irradiated necessarily that is one method of

883
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:30,207
Handling I'm butt

884
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:35,327
It's not it's not some sort of like you can refrigerate dryers up

885
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:39,423
Are you can eat them

886
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:41,727
Usable

887
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:42,751
Has a vaccine

888
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:45,055
Do involve radiation

889
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:47,103
Absolutely it's not the only one

890
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:50,175
I don't see any

891
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:51,455
From the

892
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:52,735
Primary sources that out

893
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:56,319
Nation from the lab

894
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:57,599
Specifically use the radio

895
00:48:58,111 --> 00:49:01,951
I don't know about that

896
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:03,999
And the fact that he saying that he killed all the ferrets

897
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:05,279
Lead me to believe that

898
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:06,559
He doesn't have a handle on the X

899
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:08,095
Suzuki

900
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:09,375
Keeps going back to that one

901
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:10,399
Information

902
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:16,031
Definitely

903
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:16,799
Freeze-dry the

904
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:19,359
A couple of weeks

905
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:20,639
It's just like chick

906
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:22,943
Sure you don't want to leave it in

907
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:24,223
In the fridge for a couple of weeks

908
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:26,783
It's going to go bad

909
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:29,087
See you later you put it in the freezer that's my advice

910
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:30,111
Irradiated

911
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:32,159
I don't know if I

912
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:34,975
He's getting his information

913
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:37,023
I'm from and this is deeply deeply Bravo

914
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:40,351
Weather

915
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:41,887
Baxter vaccine

916
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:48,287
National papers in Czech Republic

917
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:52,895
Infowars.com prisonplanet.com

918
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:59,039
It sounds like I wrote them they're saying there's no way this is on purpose what on Earth is going on

919
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:01,599
To mainstream news

920
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:02,367
Is saying

921
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:04,671
And it sounds like Alex Road

922
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:07,743
Yeah

923
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:11,583
I found all of the check

924
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:12,351
News sources

925
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:15,423
The way I was able to find them

926
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:18,495
Is by reading Paul Joseph Watson article

927
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:19,519
And finding where

928
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:20,287
Qlink

929
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:22,591
To the check mainstream news source

930
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:23,359
Okay

931
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:24,383
Keep doesn't

932
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:31,295
That seems odd for him to not link

933
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:32,575
He claims to

934
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:33,855
He cites his sources

935
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:37,439
He does fight the sources of these mainstream check news

936
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:38,463
Places

937
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:40,255
Now the link that he uses

938
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:46,911
Takes you to a blog post on a website called 911 blogger

939
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:58,175
Put on 911 blogger

940
00:50:58,687 --> 00:50:59,711
Purport

941
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:02,527
You have excerpt of the translation

942
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:04,575
From the check news articles

943
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:08,159
The source

944
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:09,951
And they don't say what he say

945
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:13,279
I got these articles translated

946
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:16,095
I got a pretty good handle on what they're saying

947
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:18,911
Edit 911 blogger is

948
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:21,727
11

949
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:24,543
Could have been written by Alec

950
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:29,407
More life

951
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:31,199
All of Alex Jones

952
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:32,991
Is there are these check news

953
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:36,319
They're being interpreted by 9/11 blogger

954
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:37,087
Right

955
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:40,927
Write these articles say

956
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:42,975
If he's not at 11 blogger

957
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:44,511
Bless you

958
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:47,839
He's coming with some truth into your twin towers of it

959
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:50,399
911

960
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:51,167
Translate

961
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:53,983

Based on 9/11 bloggers in

964
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:02,431
Haitian

965
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:03,711
It also doesn't make

966
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:04,479
Make clear

967
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:05,247
You quoting

968
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:07,807
The editorializing of 911 blogger

969
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:11,391
And when he's talking about the purported translation from the check

970
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:12,159
Now

971
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:13,951
Further third step

972
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:16,767
Is Alex Jones editorializing about Paul Joseph

973
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:21,887
Interpretation of the editorializing 2911 blogger date

974
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:24,191
This is a crazy game of telephone

975
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:27,775
Telephone play the game of telephone

976
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:29,055
Right

977
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:30,847
Is boring because everybody always here

978
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:36,479
It's never funny at the end

979
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:38,527
To the check news sources

980
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:40,831
What I found

981
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:42,367
What I laid out at the beginning

982
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:43,903
Biotest

983
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:45,951
The company that is most response

984
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:47,231
Before this fuk up

985
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:50,303
Of running this lab

986
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:51,071
Pills

987
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:53,119
Anne Baxter International

988
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:54,399
Had interest

989
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:00,031
Biotest lab

990
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:01,311
Nav is green

991
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:02,591
Hill's is also

992
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:03,359
Doing research

993
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:04,383
At this lab

994
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:05,407
And somehow

995
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:06,687
Biotest

996
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:08,479
Is mostly responsible for

997
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:12,831
Now I've

998
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:14,367
If you read

999
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:16,671
911 blogger.com

1000
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:18,207
It's very clear

1001
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:19,231
That

1002
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:19,999
I'm guessing it's a

1003
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:22,303
They are saying

1004
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:23,839
It doesn't jibe with that

1005
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:25,375
Here's the first block problem

1006
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:29,471
911 blogger states that quote the check company biotech near

1007
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:32,031
Comprar got from Austria testing batch

1008
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:33,055
The new flu vaccine

1009
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:34,079
2009

1010
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:35,103
From an American company

1011
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:35,871
Baxter

1012
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:37,151
In February

1013
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:38,175
You found the vaccine

1014
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:39,711
Was contaminated by the 85

1015
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:40,479
Navy

1016
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:43,551
This is not what primary sources say

1017
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:45,855
Austrian company

1018
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:46,623
Avis

1019
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:47,903
Sales is running tests on

1020
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:51,999
Who are also contracted by Baxter

1021
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:53,279
Is loggers trying to

1022
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:54,303
Comply with the vaccine

1023
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:55,327
Coming from Baxter

1024
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:56,863
Work intimidated from the beginning

1025
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:57,887
Who did not proven

1026
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:00,191
That's number one

1027
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:01,727
Number to Bravo

1028
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:03,263
911 block of states

1029
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:04,031
Quotes

1030
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:06,079
Problem of the Baxter Vic

1031
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:07,103
Contamination

1032
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:08,383
H501

1033
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:09,663
Was found in the Laboratories

1034
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:11,455
Lavenia Austria and Germany

1035
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:12,991
Which confirms that the source of

1036
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:14,527
In fact the Baxter

1037
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:16,831
This is also not true based on

1038
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:17,855
Some primary sources

1039
00:54:18,111 --> 00:54:20,415
The Articles Clearly say that the samples that ended up

1040
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:21,951
Slovenia Austria and Germany

1041
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:24,255
All originated from that Biotest lab

1042
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:26,815
Where the Avis Greenhills were running their test

1043
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:29,375
Underway to lakhs of standards and regulations

1044
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:30,911
You take a note

1045
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:31,935
So you going to jump in

1046
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:36,543
Number three

1047
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:41,151
911 first the company Baxter was he's open to trades

1048
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:45,759
Bh5 N1 virus

1049
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:46,527
The vaccine

1050
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:50,879
But then when it was already clear that the source of the Contagion

1051
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:52,671
The representative for

1052
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:54,207
That's a contaminated virus

1053
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:58,047
Produced by Baxter Laboratories for the company abreviar Greenhills

1054
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:03,679
While it is true that Baxter said that they cannot comment on how things had happened without giving up Ray.

1055
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:04,959
About their process

1056
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:05,983
There.

1057
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:09,311
It was a procedural error that took place at our branch

1058
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:10,847
I cannot tell you the details

1059
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:12,383
I cannot reveal our business.

1060
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:15,455
Action to prevent such a

1061
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:16,479
Mistake

1062
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:18,271
They were not forced

1063
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:20,831
In commenting because it's clear

1064
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:22,111
That they were the source of the

1065
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:24,159
The contamination

1066
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:25,439
Complete editorialize

1067
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:26,719
And misrepresentation

1068
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:28,511
911

1069
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:32,095
It is been being weird and parotid by Paul Joseph Watson

1070
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:32,863
Did somebody

1071
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:33,887
Yahoo

1072
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:36,959
Spread this time

1073
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:42,847
The problem number for Ati AR

1074
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:44,639
Biotest

1075
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:46,175
Is the source of the Misunderstood

1076
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:48,735
I thought here's what

1077
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:51,807
I'm trying to understand

1078
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:55,391
To keep everything

1079
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:58,207
From what I understand the timeline event

1080
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:02,303
Baxter and Avi are

1081
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:07,167
Yes dir is working on

1082
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:11,007
Is working on the vaccine

1083
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:15,359
Avian flu

1084
00:56:16,383 --> 00:56:17,663
Because of the Lacs

1085
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:21,759
And Avi are

1086
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:23,551
Baxter's vaccine

1087
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:26,879
Is contaminated flu vaccine

1088
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:28,159
Baxter

1089
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:34,047
Is then sending this vaccine out to these other places from Biotest

1090
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:37,887
Vax if it were contaminated that would be the correct process

1091
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:44,287
Yeah so it's call Jim it's all just they were sharing the same lab nobody is really doing

1092
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:45,055
A good job with paying

1093
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:46,847
Yes

1094
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:48,639
Governmental regulations

1095
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:53,503
But the other thing that's important

1096
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:54,527
Before

1097
00:56:54,783 --> 00:56:55,295
Became a public

1098
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:56,319
Health crisis at all

1099
00:56:56,575 --> 00:56:58,367
Those safeguards with the ferret testing

1100
00:56:58,623 --> 00:56:59,647
Stuff like that

1101
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:00,927
And everything was able

1102
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:02,975
Go to be lockdown

1103
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:03,999
Which is

1104
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:05,279
This biotech

1105
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:06,559
Which is not

1106
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:10,143
To make the Misunderstood

1107
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:11,167
They were stubborn

1108
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:12,703
Contracting work for back

1109
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:14,495
That it's not

1110
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:17,567
It's important to Mancos to pay

1111
00:57:18,847 --> 00:57:21,407
Won't do it for you

1112
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:23,967
There was still a Fail-Safe of like

1113
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:24,991
Hey are we murdering

1114
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:27,551
Phone number for

1115
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:31,903
911 blogger says quote check authorities now will hopefully proceed

1116
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:32,671
With the prosecution

1117
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:34,719
He's involved in a course

1118
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:37,023
The suit for criminal negligence in public menace

1119
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:38,303
Baxter is still on the

1120
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:40,607
This is not found anywhere

1121
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:41,631
The primary sources

1122
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:47,775
What they do say is that Dana drove over

1123
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:51,103
Quotes will be getting ministrator proceedings in the coming days

1124
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:52,895
Against Biotech

1125
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:54,687
Define culpability

1126
00:57:54,943 --> 00:57:56,991
They could face a fine of 25 million crowns

1127
00:57:57,503 --> 00:57:58,015
Approximately

1128
00:57:58,527 --> 00:57:59,295
$28,000

1129
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:01,087
This again

1130
00:58:01,343 --> 00:58:02,623
It's an important distinction

1131
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:04,415
Because that's not the same company as Baxter

1132
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:06,207
Can you sing the Baxters

1133
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:06,975
Prosecution

1134
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:08,767
It's not Biotest

1135
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:10,815
The problem number five

1136
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:13,119
The middleman

1137
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:14,655
It's like a it's like a

1138
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:16,191
Place that just has a lap

1139
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:22,591
It's just like a we got a lab

1140
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:27,455
Clearance

1141
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:28,991
To do test online

1142
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:35,135
Attractive place for Avis Greenhills

1143
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:40,255
Space where you can rent an office for a day

1144
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:41,279
With

1145
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:43,583
What you would do need far greater

1146
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:48,447
Controls

1147
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:54,847
We can do it serves again

1148
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:58,175
Inasmuch as you have this company that

1149
00:58:58,431 --> 00:58:59,455
It needs a place

1150
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:01,247
To do work out of you

1151
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:02,015
Have a place

1152

Workout abs

1153
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:04,063
You come together and

1154
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:05,087
Everybody makes

1155
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:08,415
To have your own Laboratory

1156
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:10,207
Because you're not using it

1157
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:13,279
Or your own laboratory but it's not

1158
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:14,303
Cleared to do tasks

1159
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:19,423
Breakfast particular exactly

1160
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:21,471
Raise all of your standards up

1161
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:26,591
Do what you need eggs act as we know all too well most people don't follow the standard

1162
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:27,871
Until they're caught

1163
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:30,943
A lot of people are humans

1164
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:37,855
Are you suggest the capitalism has a has an inherent

1165
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:39,903
Work at those places are still cute

1166
00:59:40,415 --> 00:59:40,927
Invicta

1167
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:42,975
Everyone Cuts Corners at the work

1168
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:45,791
Especially after a while you work there

1169
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:47,583
Are you f****** stick to all the rules

1170
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:49,375
Ears

1171
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:50,655
Eventually find out what

1172
00:59:50,911 --> 00:59:52,703
Hey what's going to get me caught what's not

1173
00:59:52,959 --> 00:59:53,983
Yeah

1174
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:58,847
Flu vaccine

1175
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:05,503
What happens if you know what you're you're just lazing around your

1176
01:00:06,015 --> 01:00:06,783
Google and share

1177
01:00:07,295 --> 01:00:08,319
Instead of doing your work

1178
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:12,927
That's just like anybody who's had a job knows that

1179
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:14,975
Kind of the patio you don't like

1180
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:18,047
Imagine if that happens in official places

1181
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:20,607
It just might

1182
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:24,447
It's a gig for these people you know

1183
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:27,007
Speaking of gigs 911 bloggers got one

1184
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:29,567
Make a note he is a vocation

1185
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:30,591
He has a calling

1186
01:00:31,103 --> 01:00:33,407
And that is about 9/11

1187
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:37,759
Aegis of a 911

1188
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:40,063
Problem number five

1189
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:41,343
With

1190
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:42,367
Coverages that

1191
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:44,159
Are they close by

1192
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:47,487
But was this just a criminal negligence or wasn't an attempt

1193
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:49,279
Provoke pandemic

1194
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:50,303
Being against flute

1195
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:51,327
Spread the disease

1196
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:55,167
I've been cash in for the vaccines Against h5n One

1197
01:00:55,423 --> 01:00:56,703
Which Baxter developed

1198
01:00:57,215 --> 01:01:01,311
This is super irresponsible conjecture

1199
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:02,079
Post on

1200
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:03,103
He would know that that's

1201
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:05,151
Not at all what's being reported

1202
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:08,991
He further goes on to ask quote don't they follow Eva

1203
01:01:09,247 --> 01:01:10,015
Basic precautions

1204
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:11,551
The American Pharma companies

1205
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:15,391
American Farmer

1206
01:01:15,903 --> 01:01:18,207
Subcontract

1207
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:19,231
Check web

1208
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:20,255
It also turns out

1209
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:22,047
No they don't have the regulations

1210
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:22,815
Someplace before

1211
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:23,583
Strict implies

1212
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:26,143
Precaution it is not an American Farmer

1213
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:26,911
Company

1214
01:01:27,423 --> 01:01:28,703
You know what is this

1215
01:01:28,959 --> 01:01:30,495
Is the plot of the BBC

1216
01:01:30,751 --> 01:01:31,263
T-Series

1217
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:33,823
But it's a British series

1218
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:35,103
Utopia

1219
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:38,175
It's great if you haven't seen it I recommend it

1220
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:42,271
He's alive but otherwise

1221
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:43,551
Absolute

1222
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:46,623
That series may be great

1223
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:47,903
But

1224
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:49,183
Is f****** your responsible

1225
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:57,375
Now Paul Joseph Watson gets even more irresponsible as the edges on layer

1226
01:01:58,655 --> 01:02:04,799
He answers only our propaganda to reporting a 911 blogger post and pretends that he's reporting on stories

1227
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:07,103
Check media quote from Paul Joseph

1228
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:09,663
According to compiled translation

1229
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:11,455
Check Paper Store

1230
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:16,319
The media over there is asking tough questions about whether the contamination with part of the deliberate

1231
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:17,599
Start a pandemic

1232
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:23,487
Was this just a criminal negligence or was it an attempt to provoke

1233

Medium

01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:30,399
H5 and one which Baxter develop

1235
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:33,215
How could on on Earth

H5 ordinary flu vaccine

1237
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:39,871
Don't even basic precautions the American Pharma companies

Translation

1240
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:43,711
He's using the lab

1241
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:45,759
Paragraph where 911 blogger

1242
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:47,039
Is editorializing

1243
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:49,087
Purported translation

1244
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:51,647
The Paul Joseph Watson

01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:52,671
Planet article

1246
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:54,207
Something that comes from

1247
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:54,975
From the translation

1248
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:55,743
Check media

1249
01:02:56,767 --> 01:02:57,791
Presented the idea

1250
01:02:58,047 --> 01:03:00,863
That the media is

1251
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:05,215
What does Criminal negligence or the temp to cause a pandemic

1252
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:08,799
Precautions in American Pharma companies

1253
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:12,127
He's saying that that comes from a translation of check news sources

1254
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:13,151
It does not

1255
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:15,967
It comes from a 911 blogger

1256
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:20,831
911 editorializing about his quotes

1257
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:25,439
From the translation of Portage

1258
01:03:28,255 --> 01:03:28,767
Make a platform

1259
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:31,583
Is there a zz completely unrelated

1260
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:33,119
Parallel lines

1261
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:35,167
Better connected

1262
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:36,447
Paul Joseph Watson

1263
01:03:36,959 --> 01:03:41,311
9/11 misreporting of the check newspaper

1264
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:43,103
To draw conclusions like quotes

1265
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:47,967
The fact that Baxter mixed the deadly H5 N1 virus with a mix of h3n

1266
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:50,783
Seasonal flu viruses is the Smoking Gun

1267
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:59,231
The quotes there can be little doubt therefore this was a deliberate attempt to weaponize H5 N1 virus

1268
01:03:59,487 --> 01:04:00,255
Extreme

1269
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:02,559
Sexy

1270
01:04:02,815 --> 01:04:04,863
To the population who would others

1271
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:07,423
To a devastating degree of the disease when terrible

1272
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:13,311
That sounds right pjw editorialize like crazy and just throws out his own opinions masquerading as facts

1273
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:15,359
However to reiterate

1274
01:04:15,615 --> 01:04:16,895
The key aspect of the story that it's

1275
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:19,455
It's virtually impossible for live avian flu virus

1276
01:04:19,711 --> 01:04:20,735
Find its way into effect

1277
01:04:21,247 --> 01:04:21,759
Biaxin

1278
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:23,551
Which I would respond to buy

1279
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:26,367
A proper protocol

1280
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:27,647
For handling a

1281
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:28,671
This materials

1282
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:30,719
Sample could be unlabeled to get mixed up

1283
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:33,279
Surfaces are containers could be on properly Santa

1284
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:35,327
There's hundreds of different little ways

1285
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:37,631
Would happen

1286
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:41,727
Find it almost harder to imagine that it could happen

1287
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:42,495
Purpose

1288
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:48,895
It been on accident it's a much more

1289
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:51,455
Purpose someone work

1290
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:56,575
Everyone about that whereas the only thing that makes sense

1291
01:04:56,831 --> 01:04:57,855
Transfer it to of gotten

1292
01:04:58,111 --> 01:04:58,623
So far

1293
01:04:58,879 --> 01:04:59,903
Is that it was

1294
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:03,231
You look into

1295
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:04,511
Check

1296
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:11,679
Corn

1297
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:13,471
That they

1298
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:15,519
Conclusion they came away with his

1299
01:05:15,775 --> 01:05:16,543
It's way too easy

1300
01:05:17,055 --> 01:05:19,103
Something like this to happen

1301
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:20,383
Governmental

1302
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:21,663
Regulations

1303
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:25,759
Just like the way we treat our nuclear stockpile

1304
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:28,575
Fall Apart

1305
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:29,599
Larry's got that under

1306
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:31,135
Don't worry about it

1307
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:32,415
From here

1308
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:33,439
Paul Joseph Watson

1309
01:05:33,695 --> 01:05:36,255
Fills out his article with a template for an Infowars

1310
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:39,071
Assertions that the vaccine companies are trying to cause a

1311
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:39,839
Pandemics

1312
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:40,863
Can sell more vaccine

1313
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:45,215
Applying the rich globalist stand to gain a lot of money they sell more vaccine

1314
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:49,311
And of course the long tube unclaimed at the globalist want to kill 80% of the population

1315
01:05:49,823 --> 01:05:51,103
It's a very standard

1316
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:53,151
Infowars

1317
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:55,199
A very valuable opportunity

1318
01:05:55,711 --> 01:05:56,223
To trace the route

1319
01:05:56,479 --> 01:05:57,759
From a check story

1320
01:05:58,015 --> 01:06:00,063
Getting misrepresented by a conspiracy blogger

1321
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:03,135
Who is represented by Paul Joseph Watson

1322
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:05,183
Whose story Alex then reports on

1323
01:06:05,439 --> 01:06:05,951
On his show

1324
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:08,511
As if it were actually based on any reality

1325
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:11,327
Is a perfect encapsulation of Infowars lack

1326
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:12,095
Journalistic

1327
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:14,399
Looks like

1328
01:06:16,703 --> 01:06:19,519
It's crazy to look at this

1329
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:21,567
Oh here's the original story

1330
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:22,847
Here's the first

1331
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:24,895
Here's the second life

1332
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:27,967
And here's Alex reporting on the second lie as if it were the

1333
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:30,527
Mainstream news

1334
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:34,623
Is about realizing on the 2nd

1335
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:35,903
F****** crazy

1336
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:37,183
He's stage 3

1337
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:38,207
It's not

1338
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:40,511
Things get really interesting

1339
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:42,559
I told you that

1340
01:06:42,815 --> 01:06:44,351
Bloomberg had reported on

1341
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:46,655
The story on February 24th

1342
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:48,191
They wrote that article and check

1343
01:06:48,447 --> 01:06:53,311
A good week before Alex is reporting on it and saying that there's nothing in the American Media about

1344
01:06:53,823 --> 01:06:56,639
Bloomberg has put out an article about this

1345
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:57,663
It's interesting to

1346
01:06:57,919 --> 01:07:00,735
Because in this Bloomberg article that claimed that Baxter was to blame

1347
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:01,759
For the contamination

1348
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:03,807
There's a couple problems that I found

1349
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:10,719
The first is that at no point in the store citations do Alex Paul Joseph Watson or 911 blogger

1350
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:12,767
They don't bring that up at all

1351
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:19,167
So if they

1352
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:23,519
But Bloomberg is saying what's in line with

1353
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:24,799
Conjecture

1354
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:27,615
So I'm confused why they don't bring that

1355
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:34,015
It's very confusing cuz it actually wouldn't have

1356
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:36,319
Kind of back up there bulshit

1357
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:41,951
Problem is that I could only find that story by searching to the way back

1358
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:42,975
Archive

1359
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:44,255
And I think it's

1360
01:07:44,511 --> 01:07:47,071
Entirely possible that articles based on bad reporting

1361
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:48,351
Which they issued a retraction

1362
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:49,631
10-4 then took down to pay

1363
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:51,423
Right I can't find the retractor

1364
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:52,447
Cancel the story

1365
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:53,983
Really strong reason to believe

1366
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:56,799
That the Bloomberg story represents bad reporting

1367
01:07:57,567 --> 01:07:58,591
What's my feelings

1368
01:07:58,847 --> 01:08:03,199
Well Jordan I was able to find a presentation that was put together by Carol Hebert

1369
01:08:03,455 --> 01:08:06,015
Of the State office for nuclear safety in the Czech Republic

1370
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:09,343
Reflecting the results of their investigation into the incident of quote

1371
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:11,391
Potential human bird flu outbreak

1372
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:13,183
So

1373
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:14,207
Presentation mix

1374
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:15,743
Abundantly clear what happened

1375
01:08:16,255 --> 01:08:16,767
Blame

1376
01:08:17,023 --> 01:08:18,815
They review communication record

1377
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:22,911
Lab documents conducted interviews with everyone who is involved and the police

1378
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:26,239
And it reflected that

1379
01:08:26,495 --> 01:08:29,311
Several paragraphs of the biological weapons prohibition

1380
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:32,895
Including illegal handling of GMO with evidence

1381
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:34,175
Freely given to inspect

1382
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:35,967
The presentation reflect

1383
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:40,831
The company at fault in this case not Baxter and even concludes by saying quote

1384
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:42,623
Officially nothing serious happened

1385
01:08:42,879 --> 01:08:47,999
I called to change a result of quote a chain of regrettable blunders

1386
01:08:48,255 --> 01:08:50,303
Which could be remedied with better Communications

1387
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:53,631
Enhanced cooperation between National agencies

1388
01:08:53,887 --> 01:08:55,423
It possibly added legislate

1389
01:08:55,935 --> 01:08:57,215
And of course firing the three

1390
01:08:57,983 --> 01:09:00,543
They further reflected in this report

1391
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:02,847
The quote Biotest was under hard pressure

1392
01:09:03,103 --> 01:09:05,663
From avir Greenhill to break National legislation

1393
01:09:05,919 --> 01:09:06,943
Speed up test

1394
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:09,759
The vaccine February 2009

1395
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:14,111
I think there we found our biggest issue right there

1396
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:19,743
Just like an Austrian company that is

1397
01:09:19,999 --> 01:09:21,535
Is doing this research

1398
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:23,327
Under the laws

1399
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:24,607
Complacent their own country

1400
01:09:24,863 --> 01:09:26,399
Not in America

1401
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:28,191
Even so what you see is

1402
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:29,471
Buck up is caused by

1403
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:34,591
Through this at a Breakneck

1404
01:09:34,847 --> 01:09:35,359
Speed

1405
01:09:35,615 --> 01:09:36,639
Getting mixed up

1406
01:09:36,895 --> 01:09:37,407
With

1407
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:38,175
Staples

1408
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:40,479
Come from Baxter's at work Lane

1409
01:09:40,991 --> 01:09:41,759
People f****** up

1410
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:43,039
They don't have

1411
01:09:43,295 --> 01:09:44,575
Adequate regulation

1412
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:47,903
That now

1413
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:49,439
Do austrians hate the

1414
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:51,231
I don't know

1415
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:57,631
I don't I don't know about that level of European it's entirely possible but I don't know

1416
01:09:57,887 --> 01:09:59,423
We have here is a very clear case

1417
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:01,983
When I read stories

1418
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:06,079
They completely are aligned with the results of the investigation

1419
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:09,663
Betty check Office of the State Office of nuclear safety

1420
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:11,711
Doll that matches up

1421
01:10:11,967 --> 01:10:13,503
The things that don't match up

1422
01:10:13,759 --> 01:10:18,111
Are the misinterpretations made by 911 blogger that Alex Jones reporting on

1423
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:22,207
And this Bloomberg story that they aren't even talking about that has been taken off the internet

1424
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:24,767
So I'm left with the conclusion

1425
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:26,815
Set the check primary sources

1426
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:30,143
And their investigation that they did

1427
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:31,167
Are correct

1428
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:33,727
And that Baxter was found not to be at fault

1429
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:35,775
Now the reason is Alex's

1430
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:36,799
Going to make them at Falls

1431
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:38,335
Is there a vaccine

1432
01:10:39,871 --> 01:10:40,639
No

1433
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:42,431
So he's going to use this

1434
01:10:45,503 --> 01:10:51,647
Goddamnit that's was primarily motivated

1435
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:52,415
Like Baxter is

1436
01:10:54,719 --> 01:11:00,863
They have been involved in a lot of mess ups in the past in the story.

1437
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:06,239
We not 911 to work

1438
01:11:06,751 --> 01:11:10,335
Perfectly legitimate journalist

1439
01:11:10,591 --> 01:11:16,735
Every time I'm not going to believe anybody who's in 911 hurdle for you to get over incredibility

1440
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:20,319
It's so it it's so important

1441
01:11:21,855 --> 01:11:23,135
We do make it clear that backs

1442
01:11:23,391 --> 01:11:24,415
Can go f*** himself to

1443
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:27,999
But in this case they weren't in the wrong

1444
01:11:28,255 --> 01:11:29,279
Pressure

1445
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:30,303
Being applied on the

1446
01:11:30,559 --> 01:11:31,327
Aaviri

1447
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:35,167
Blackwater dozen

1448
01:11:35,423 --> 01:11:35,935
Fuk up once

1449
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:36,959
Timer

1450
01:11:37,215 --> 01:11:39,519
Bi-Rite

1451
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:45,151
Observation

1452
01:11:50,783 --> 01:11:54,367
Which one

1453
01:11:57,183 --> 01:11:58,463
911 log

1454
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:01,535
Call Joseph

1455
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:04,607
This is a disaster

1456
01:12:04,863 --> 01:12:05,375
Embarrassing

1457
01:12:05,631 --> 01:12:08,703
Propaganda effort

1458
01:12:08,959 --> 01:12:10,239
And it's really difficult to see

1459
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:11,519
How much Alex

1460
01:12:11,775 --> 01:12:12,287
Cuz even aware

1461
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:14,591
You know like I don't know when he's aware of

1462
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:17,919
Does he know that 911 is totally wrong

1463
01:12:18,175 --> 01:12:19,967
Does he know that Paul Joseph Watson

1464
01:12:20,223 --> 01:12:21,247
Is reporting editor

1465
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:22,271
Toriel state

1466
01:12:22,527 --> 01:12:24,831
Buy 911 blogger

1467
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:32,255
You might be getting tricked by the propaganda maybe maybe here's my healing of his complicity

1468
01:12:32,511 --> 01:12:34,303
He was like hey

1469
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:36,095
I'm not going to get the flu vaccine

1470
01:12:36,351 --> 01:12:39,423
Flu vaccine thing

1471
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:40,447
Paul Joseph Watson

1472
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:41,983
Grabs on any stories

1473
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:45,311
Search clothing and then Alex of course because he's an idiot

1474
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:46,591
Just start quoting

1475
01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:51,455
Anything is possible I can't say for sure but

1476
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:52,479
Details the fact

1477
01:12:52,991 --> 01:12:54,527
Let's enjoy Alex

1478
01:12:55,551 --> 01:12:57,599
Try and tell this story on air

1479
01:12:57,855 --> 01:12:59,135
Notice all of the points

1480
01:12:59,391 --> 01:13:02,207
Where he's just quoting a 911 blogger as if it's

1481
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:10,399
Confirm Friday

1482
01:13:15,007 --> 01:13:18,079
Five-in-one avian flu viruses

1483
01:13:18,335 --> 01:13:19,871
Canadian press

1484
01:13:20,127 --> 01:13:21,663
Toronto Sun online

1485
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:26,015
Baxter flu vaccines

1486
01:13:29,087 --> 01:13:30,879
Biological weapons on Earth

1487
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:37,791
Czech Republic

1488
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:39,327
All extra quoting from

1489
01:13:42,143 --> 01:13:43,423
You know I will say this

1490
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:45,983
The best life

1491
01:13:55,711 --> 01:13:59,039
Going to have for almost all the rest of these clips

1492
01:13:59,295 --> 01:14:02,367
He's quoting 911 blogger as if it's the news that's not good

1493
01:14:06,463 --> 01:14:06,975
Shut up

1494
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:09,023
This was see me when you can

1495
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:16,959
Then hide the fact that the accidental contamination vaccine

1496
01:14:17,215 --> 01:14:23,359
Criminal negligence

1497
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:29,759
Arita check

1498
01:14:30,015 --> 01:14:34,367
Don't just read the checks

1499
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:36,927
That is Corollary

1500
01:14:38,463 --> 01:14:39,743
Implied warranty

1501
01:14:40,255 --> 01:14:41,791
What is the road

1502
01:14:49,727 --> 01:14:51,007
Exact

1503
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:55,103
Preparation

1504
01:14:55,615 --> 01:14:57,407
To create a new

1505
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:04,319
1918 Spanish flu

1506
01:15:04,575 --> 01:15:05,087
Is it

1507
01:15:05,599 --> 01:15:07,903
It was combined

1508
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:09,183
Between

1509
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:14,047
Normal extremely Airborne extremely contagious

1510
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:17,887
Strain of flu

1511
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:23,263
Where's the bird flu highly airborne and highly contagious

1512
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:26,847
How could you tell if you hear what I'm telling

1513
01:15:27,871 --> 01:15:34,015
They don't involve like none of these stories involve instructions to combine these things in order to create

1514
01:15:35,295 --> 01:15:40,927
He's just making that up that's not even in the 9/11 blogger stuff

1515
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:42,719
The same time

1516
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:46,047
Yes

1517
01:15:46,815 --> 01:15:49,887
F*** it f*** if I know just makes him like an old man

1518
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:55,007
No because the issue is

1519
01:15:59,103 --> 01:16:00,127
I think they did a story

1520
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:01,919
It's impossible but like

1521
01:16:02,175 --> 01:16:03,199
Okay

1522
01:16:03,455 --> 01:16:04,479
The issue of

1523
01:16:04,735 --> 01:16:05,759
Like instructions

1524
01:16:06,015 --> 01:16:06,783
Is just made

1525
01:16:07,295 --> 01:16:08,063
That's not

1526
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:09,087
At all

1527
01:16:11,135 --> 01:16:13,439
Issue

1528
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:14,207
You got it

1529
01:16:14,463 --> 01:16:16,255
So did we have

1530
01:16:16,511 --> 01:16:17,023
Here is the

1531
01:16:18,559 --> 01:16:19,583
That

1532
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:20,863
Refer

1533
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:21,887
Lemon zest

1534
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:24,191
That's really going to bring out

1535
01:16:28,031 --> 01:16:29,823
This Toronto Sun article is where Alex's

1536
01:16:33,151 --> 01:16:33,919
They're disgusting

1537
01:16:39,807 --> 01:16:40,831
From the Toronto Sun

1538
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:45,951
Accidental release of a mixture of live h5xhs

1539
01:16:46,207 --> 01:16:47,743
Could have resulted in dire consequence

1540
01:16:48,511 --> 01:16:50,559
H5 in one doesn't easily affect

1541
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:52,095
Infect people H3

1542
01:16:52,351 --> 01:16:53,119
Viruses

1543
01:16:53,631 --> 01:16:54,911
If someone exposed to a mixture of the

1544
01:16:56,959 --> 01:16:57,471
Bowstring

1545
01:16:57,727 --> 01:16:59,007
He or she could have served as a

1546
01:16:59,775 --> 01:17:01,823
Bayer for a hybrid virus

1547
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:03,359
Easily to and among people

1548
01:17:03,871 --> 01:17:04,383
That makes him

1549
01:17:06,175 --> 01:17:07,455
Is one of two ways pandemic virus

1550
01:17:07,967 --> 01:17:08,479
Create it

1551
01:17:08,735 --> 01:17:10,271
There's no suggestion that happened

1552
01:17:12,063 --> 01:17:12,575
So Alex

1553
01:17:12,831 --> 01:17:13,343
Taking this

1554
01:17:13,855 --> 01:17:15,135
Possibility that they

1555
01:17:20,255 --> 01:17:20,767
The implication

1556
01:17:22,047 --> 01:17:26,655
He's taking that as some sort of like

1557
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:28,447
Read the next line is there's no snow

1558
01:17:29,215 --> 01:17:29,983
That happened because of this

1559
01:17:31,519 --> 01:17:32,287
Because it did

1560
01:17:34,079 --> 01:17:36,639
Because it was never injected into a person

1561
01:17:37,151 --> 01:17:38,687
With both of those viruses

1562
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:40,735
In order to incubate

1563
01:17:41,759 --> 01:17:42,783
Mutant virus

1564
01:17:43,295 --> 01:17:44,063
And even then

1565
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:44,831
Really

1566
01:17:45,087 --> 01:17:45,599
You would

1567
01:17:46,111 --> 01:17:48,927
No how would you take unless you had done this

1568
01:17:49,183 --> 01:17:49,695
Before

1569
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:50,719
Right

1570
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:54,815
Possibly predict that it would just mutate the way that you

1571
01:17:55,327 --> 01:17:57,631
That you couldn't just predict

1572
01:17:57,887 --> 01:17:58,399
Mutate

1573
01:17:58,655 --> 01:18:02,495
Like you just put one in there in the other one in there and then comes out

1574
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:04,543
I think I think even sodas

1575
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:07,615
A little bit of unpredictability and randomness

1576
01:18:08,127 --> 01:18:10,431
If you know what you're doing. It's not like bacon

1577
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:12,223
Ingredients

1578
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:14,015
Continue Cyrus's don't

1579
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:14,783
Like

1580
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:17,087
Just do what you tell them to to

1581
01:18:17,599 --> 01:18:21,439
I don't think they do again I'm not a scientist but I'm not entirely sure but I can read

1582
01:18:21,695 --> 01:18:23,999
So I can tell you that Alex is just full of s***

1583
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:25,535
I'm making stuff up to

1584
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:26,815
The Narrative that he wants to

1585
01:18:28,607 --> 01:18:30,143
Because he wants to scare you

1586
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:42,431
Tie-dye dye

1587
01:18:50,623 --> 01:18:55,487
So they're putting you into

1588
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:05,215
Airborne until the world population

1589
01:19:05,471 --> 01:19:10,079
So he's trying to scare you bring his other narratives in order to reinforce all of them

1590
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:11,871
The coffin

1591
01:19:12,383 --> 01:19:17,503
Remedy brings in out member end

1592
01:19:21,087 --> 01:19:21,599
Archived

1593
01:19:22,879 --> 01:19:26,975
Play Phil

1594
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:29,535
Bianca who was in

1595
01:19:30,047 --> 01:19:32,095
Harshly mischaracterized

1596
01:19:32,607 --> 01:19:33,119
His

1597
01:19:33,375 --> 01:19:34,143
Dentist

1598
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:36,959
Humans dying out would be great for the natural world

1599
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:38,751
Which is not an extreme

1600
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:45,151
We are doing a lot then after work

1601
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:47,967
And if you are someone who believes

1602
01:19:48,223 --> 01:19:49,759
Natural world has more

1603
01:19:50,015 --> 01:19:50,527
Gordon's been human

1604
01:19:52,063 --> 01:19:52,575
We should die

1605
01:19:52,831 --> 01:19:53,599
Or if you watched

1606
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:55,135
The Matrix

1607
01:19:55,391 --> 01:19:57,439
Virus

1608
01:19:57,951 --> 01:20:00,511
No Remnant like Alex

1609
01:20:01,535 --> 01:20:02,559
Thinking is so dim

1610
01:20:03,327 --> 01:20:03,839
So childish

1611
01:20:04,095 --> 01:20:06,143
He can't understand what are Pianka saying

1612
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:07,167
He's not

1613
01:20:07,423 --> 01:20:08,447
Forever

1614
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:09,727
You think it would be good

1615
01:20:13,567 --> 01:20:14,336
Screams about feet

1616
01:20:14,592 --> 01:20:15,104
FEMA camps

1617
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:16,384
And FEMA like

1618
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:17,920
Teaching their agents

1619
01:20:18,432 --> 01:20:20,224
Vector

1620
01:20:21,504 --> 01:20:23,552
And if you look at the video that he post

1621
01:20:24,064 --> 01:20:24,576
To make that Arkham

1622
01:20:25,344 --> 01:20:26,368
Guy blinking really

1623
01:20:27,392 --> 01:20:31,744
They say that they were terrorists

1624
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,560
Now just

1625
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:38,144
You on their side doesn't make them any less

1626
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:39,168
Ripped

1627
01:20:39,424 --> 01:20:41,472
Activities

1628
01:20:41,728 --> 01:20:42,752
Yeah it kind of

1629
01:20:43,008 --> 01:20:44,288
Is almost like they

1630
01:20:52,992 --> 01:20:54,016
Because they could

1631
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:56,064
Attack them directly

1632
01:20:57,088 --> 01:20:58,624
That was their recourse

1633
01:20:59,136 --> 01:21:00,160
Huh

1634
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:00,928
The only reason I

1635
01:21:01,184 --> 01:21:02,208
Bring that up is it so windy

1636
01:21:02,464 --> 01:21:05,280
Negative is like this inability to wrestle with ideas

1637
01:21:06,304 --> 01:21:08,096
Black and white

1638
01:21:09,376 --> 01:21:10,400
Legitimately

1639
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:11,424
Express dislike

1640
01:21:13,216 --> 01:21:14,752
Really low grade reason

1641
01:21:17,824 --> 01:21:18,336
It's something

1642
01:21:18,592 --> 01:21:19,360
Most people

1643
01:21:20,384 --> 01:21:21,408
In terms of cognitive

1644
01:21:21,664 --> 01:21:22,944
Development you grow out of it

1645
01:21:23,456 --> 01:21:24,480
You would help like it

1646
01:21:24,992 --> 01:21:26,528
If someone were to tell me

1647
01:21:26,784 --> 01:21:29,344
Let's say I was really into America and I loved it

1648
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:32,160
Find somewhere to tell me

1649
01:21:32,416 --> 01:21:34,976
If someone is saying that the founding fathers were terrorists

1650
01:21:35,232 --> 01:21:36,000
I would say

1651
01:21:37,536 --> 01:21:38,048
And I would

1652
01:21:38,304 --> 01:21:40,608
Hero Yaya cording to the British crown

1653
01:21:40,864 --> 01:21:41,376
They were

1654
01:21:43,424 --> 01:21:44,704
No reason to be worried about that

1655
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:49,824
But Alex doesn't have to what do you mean by that

1656
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:52,640
What is the actual thing that's being communicated

1657
01:21:52,896 --> 01:21:53,664
He wrestles with

1658
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:55,200
Concrete literal

1659
01:21:55,712 --> 01:21:56,224
Beer

1660
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:56,992
And just

1661
01:21:57,504 --> 01:21:58,016
Extreme

1662
01:21:58,272 --> 01:21:59,040
At what

1663
01:21:59,296 --> 01:21:59,808
Ridgewood children

1664
01:22:00,064 --> 01:22:00,832
You absolutely

1665
01:22:01,088 --> 01:22:02,112
Cannot get into the mind

1666
01:22:03,392 --> 01:22:04,928
The exact person that

1667
01:22:05,184 --> 01:22:06,976
You describe because the answer to that is

1668
01:22:07,232 --> 01:22:09,536
No they would be exactly as angry as Alex

1669
01:22:12,864 --> 01:22:13,376
Uba

1670
01:22:13,888 --> 01:22:16,704
Reasonable insane patriotic page

1671
01:22:20,544 --> 01:22:22,336
Alex

1672
01:22:27,968 --> 01:22:28,736
But he's wrong

1673
01:22:30,528 --> 01:22:32,320
Mainstream news articles

1674
01:22:32,576 --> 01:22:33,344
This is just for

1675
01:22:34,624 --> 01:22:36,416
Understand what I just covered

1676
01:22:36,928 --> 01:22:37,440
No

1677
01:22:38,464 --> 01:22:40,768
7:40 compiled

1678
01:22:41,024 --> 01:22:42,048
Translation from Czech

1679
01:22:53,824 --> 01:22:55,616
Lennar media to control

1680
01:22:55,872 --> 01:23:02,016
Bloomberg had an article about already this and then

1681
01:23:02,272 --> 01:23:04,064
Also Main Street

1682
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:07,392
American mainstream news

1683
01:23:17,376 --> 01:23:18,144
In the region

1684
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:20,704
Alex just going to find things however he wants whenever he wants

1685
01:23:26,592 --> 01:23:29,408
Globalist control

1686
01:23:29,664 --> 01:23:31,456
Before he even touches this story

1687
01:23:31,712 --> 01:23:34,528
That's out the window and then what

1688
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:36,576
Reading from that article V like

1689
01:23:36,832 --> 01:23:39,136
The media is a hard-hitting question

1690
01:23:39,392 --> 01:23:40,160
They're all that

1691
01:23:40,672 --> 01:23:41,952
He's just reading Paul Joseph

1692
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:44,000
Watson's article quoting loggers

1693
01:23:44,256 --> 01:23:45,024
Editorializing

1694
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:46,816
As if it were from actual checking

1695
01:23:47,584 --> 01:23:48,864
I know I keep repeating that

1696
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:50,400
I'm sorry to sound like a broken record

1697
01:23:50,656 --> 01:23:51,680
But it is so important

1698
01:23:52,192 --> 01:23:54,496
Baby so important to understand how propaganda

1699
01:23:55,008 --> 01:23:55,776
This is a

1700
01:23:56,032 --> 01:23:57,824
Tricom nesting dolls

1701
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:01,152
People and most people listening to Alex

1702
01:24:01,408 --> 01:24:07,296
Would never know what is in the middle of that nesting doll they would just be outermost layer

1703
01:24:07,552 --> 01:24:08,064
It is

1704
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:10,624
The best

1705
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:12,672
That's good chocolate propaganda that the Belgian

1706
01:24:12,928 --> 01:24:13,696
Seems like the best chocolate

1707
01:24:14,976 --> 01:24:15,744
Except

1708
01:24:18,304 --> 01:24:18,816
It is important

1709
01:24:19,072 --> 01:24:20,864
You at you have to open up the doll

1710

1785
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:26,368
22 months later it's a worse human being that ever lived

01:28:26,624 --> 01:28:30,464
And Paul Craig Roberts is Big claim to fame is like

1787
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:34,816
We got a vote for Obama because we went to repudiate George W bush

01:28:35,072 --> 01:28:37,376

There's no they consistently make the argument that diversity and freedom are inherently contradictory

And also the inordinate amount of time defending people who deny the Holocaust

1809
01:29:31,904 --> 01:29:37,280
It's a real dicey Outlet

1810
01:29:37,536 --> 01:29:39,584
Any defense of a burning cross

01:34:07,872 --> 01:34:09,664
Rebecca

1899
01:34:10,176 --> 01:34:12,480
Basically they're trying to cause the pandemic

1900
01:34:12,736 --> 01:34:17,856
We have already stockpiled at least 250 million doses of the bird flu vaccine

1901
01:34:18,368 --> 01:34:19,904
You know the

1902
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:23,232
The shelf life of That vaccine has a certain amount of time

1903
01:34:23,488 --> 01:34:25,536
If I would still have to throw the garbage

1904
01:34:25,792 --> 01:34:30,656
So they have to start the pandemic so that they can give the vaccine

1905
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:36,032
Belittle conspiratorial perhaps

1906
01:34:36,544 --> 01:34:37,568
Rebecca Carley

1907
01:34:39,616 --> 01:34:40,640
ICarly

1908
01:34:41,664 --> 01:34:42,688
Would you

1909
01:34:42,944 --> 01:34:47,040
ICarly have a medical doctor on to talk about this

1910
01:34:47,296 --> 01:34:50,624
Would you be surprised to learn that Rebecca Carly is not a doctor

1911
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:54,208
It turns out there

1912
01:34:54,464 --> 01:34:57,792
The New York board for professional medical conduct found Rebecca

1913
01:34:58,048 --> 01:34:59,840
Carly

1914
01:35:00,096 --> 01:35:06,240
Practicing while impaired by a mental disability

1915
01:35:06,752 --> 01:35:10,080
On the condition that

1916
01:35:10,336 --> 01:35:10,848
To seek psychiatric

1917
01:35:11,104 --> 01:35:11,616
Help

1918
01:35:11,872 --> 01:35:18,016
He did not protecting the public that she not be allowed to regain her medical license

1919
01:35:18,272 --> 01:35:19,552
Really hard

1920
01:35:21,856 --> 01:35:23,136
Oh but they did

1921
01:35:24,928 --> 01:35:26,976
Deserving of that are never

1922
01:35:29,536 --> 01:35:30,048
Wait till you hear this

1923
01:35:33,632 --> 01:35:34,912
Psychiatrist

1924
01:35:37,728 --> 01:35:43,872
He found a delusional disorder with the

1925
01:35:44,384 --> 01:35:46,432
Narcissistic and borderline personality

1926
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:53,344
That's not good.

1927
01:35:53,856 --> 01:35:58,720
It's not a lot of really good work and everything is sighted

1928
01:35:58,976 --> 01:36:01,280
Everything is as the proper citation

1929
01:36:02,048 --> 01:36:03,072
It's very professionally done

1930
01:36:03,584 --> 01:36:05,376
Do the title

1931
01:36:07,168 --> 01:36:08,448
It's watching quick

1932
01:36:09,984 --> 01:36:10,752
What you going to do

1933
01:36:11,264 --> 01:36:14,848
It's not it's not like 911 blogger at all

1934
01:36:17,664 --> 01:36:19,456
Fair enough

1935
01:36:19,712 --> 01:36:20,992
Question

1936
01:36:22,784 --> 01:36:23,296
Quotes

1937
01:36:23,552 --> 01:36:28,672
Dr. Levens also testified that the respondent believes that her husband's son

1938
01:36:30,976 --> 01:36:32,000
Because she does not vaccinate

1939
01:36:32,256 --> 01:36:34,304
Because she has children with autism

1940
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:40,704
Dr. leben's David responded believes that her husband was fulfilling the government's role in performing anal penetration

1941
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:41,728
Station on their child

1942
01:36:41,984 --> 01:36:48,128
And the transformation sends a surge of energy to the child's brain resulting in the compartmentalization of the brain

1943
01:36:48,384 --> 01:36:50,944
Which is she believes would cause multiple personalities

1944
01:36:51,712 --> 01:36:57,856
Dr. Levens also believes that the government is interested in pursuing all persons were opposed to vaccinating

1945
01:36:58,112 --> 01:37:01,952
Which is part of the global government plot in collusion with the drug into

1946
01:37:05,536 --> 01:37:06,560
Alex

1947
01:37:07,072 --> 01:37:08,096
Was a doctor

1948
01:37:08,608 --> 01:37:09,632
And wind

1949
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:14,496
Yeah well so they didn't investigation into that ex-husband

1950
01:37:14,752 --> 01:37:15,520
Sound

1951
01:37:24,992 --> 01:37:29,344
Dumpsters for paranoia

1952
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:31,392
Okay

1953
01:37:31,648 --> 01:37:32,672
She believes herself

1954
01:37:32,928 --> 01:37:38,048
To be the target of a giant conspiracy because she alone can cure pretty much every medical condition known to man

1955
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:41,120
Herself to Joan of Arc

1956
01:37:41,376 --> 01:37:43,936
And told herself with breast

1957
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:45,472
She's a little baddie

1958
01:37:50,848 --> 01:37:52,640
That would have been a way to fight

1959
01:37:52,896 --> 01:37:53,920
The British

1960
01:37:54,688 --> 01:37:58,016
Rebecca Carly is a dangerously diluted a mentally ill person

1961
01:37:58,272 --> 01:38:04,416
Well I never want to judge her solely for that she's refused to get the help that she needs and is now being used as a prop by the

1962
01:38:04,672 --> 01:38:05,440
Play some groups of the World

1963
01:38:05,696 --> 01:38:06,464
And Alex Jones

1964
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:07,744
To create dangerous property

1965
01:38:08,512 --> 01:38:10,048
And is therefore beyond the limits

1966
01:38:12,096 --> 01:38:16,960
She's been willing participant in the living out of it

1967
01:38:17,216 --> 01:38:19,776
I don't feel all that bad for I feel bad for her kid

1968
01:38:20,032 --> 01:38:22,080
I feel bad for the people in her sphere that are affected

1969
01:38:24,896 --> 01:38:25,920
Because she's mentally ill

1970
01:38:26,176 --> 01:38:27,456
She's had every opportunity

1971
01:38:27,712 --> 01:38:29,504
To take responsibility

1972
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:30,272
And

1973
01:38:30,528 --> 01:38:31,296
Get better

1974
01:38:31,552 --> 01:38:32,064
Yeah

1975
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:33,344
Yeah but you probably

1976
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:34,368
Probably should be

1977
01:38:35,904 --> 01:38:37,952
Like I don't I don't want

1978
01:38:38,208 --> 01:38:38,720
Ever

1979
01:38:39,488 --> 01:38:40,256
Experience

1980
01:38:43,072 --> 01:38:43,584
Heard

1981
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:44,864
Level it almost

1982
01:38:57,408 --> 01:38:57,920
Clearly isn't

1983
01:38:58,432 --> 01:38:59,200
Capable of controlling this

1984
01:39:02,016 --> 01:39:08,160
Gaggle of enablers who are not only financially

1985
01:39:08,928 --> 01:39:15,072
Amplify monetizing only reinforces

1986
01:39:15,328 --> 01:39:16,864
The only one to do this

1987
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:22,496
In never getting well

1988
01:39:22,752 --> 01:39:23,776
Puscifer

1989
01:39:24,032 --> 01:39:27,360
Yeah it's tragic but I also don't feel bad for her because

1990
01:39:28,896 --> 01:39:30,432
Department

1991
01:39:30,944 --> 01:39:31,456
Wrecked

1992
01:39:31,968 --> 01:39:33,248
So

1993
01:39:34,016 --> 01:39:34,528
Alex

1994
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:37,856
Has brought her in as the doctor

1995
01:39:38,112 --> 01:39:39,904
To verify

1996
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:42,464
His fears about this avian flu relief

1997
01:39:42,976 --> 01:39:46,560
Which should tell you that most people probably wouldn't come on

1998
01:39:47,072 --> 01:39:49,376
If you.

1999
01:39:49,632 --> 01:39:50,144
If you

2000
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:51,680
Googling

2001
01:39:51,936 --> 01:39:52,960
Then he asked his staff

2002
01:39:53,216 --> 01:39:58,592
To do a just Google her they would find this 2003 stripping of her life

2003
01:39:59,104 --> 01:40:00,640
Do you know that she's not a doctor

2004
01:40:01,152 --> 01:40:02,688
And all she does now is offer

2005
01:40:02,944 --> 01:40:03,968
Holistic advice

2006
01:40:04,224 --> 01:40:04,736
Two people

2007
01:40:04,992 --> 01:40:06,272
Antitoxoid Vice

2008
01:40:06,528 --> 01:40:08,064
And things like that you can do without

2009
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:09,088
A medical license

2010
01:40:09,344 --> 01:40:10,624
Do you know all that yet

2011
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:13,696
Present her as a medical doctor with

2012
01:40:13,952 --> 01:40:15,744
Some sort of a credibility in order to

2013
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,048
Further his propaganda that

2014
01:40:18,304 --> 01:40:19,328
This is a pandemic

2015
01:40:19,584 --> 01:40:21,376
That the globalists are trying to create

2016
01:40:21,888 --> 01:40:23,168
Every piece of the sting

2017
01:40:24,704 --> 01:40:25,472
Does a little added bonus

2018
01:40:25,728 --> 01:40:28,288
In 2012 Rebecca Carly would go on another

2019
01:40:28,544 --> 01:40:29,568
Conspiracy radio show

2020
01:40:29,824 --> 01:40:34,176
And call out Alex Jones for being a shill for Israel

2021
01:40:34,432 --> 01:40:36,480
Even get the song by this morning

2022
01:40:37,504 --> 01:40:38,272
Alright

2023
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:40,320
Horror Story

2024
01:40:40,832 --> 01:40:42,112
I'm really fascinated like

2025
01:40:42,368 --> 01:40:43,136
I think I told you post

2026
01:40:43,648 --> 01:40:46,464
No I mean like the tire test

2027
01:40:48,512 --> 01:40:51,072
Didn't like how long was she a medical

2028
01:40:51,328 --> 01:40:53,888
Before this

2029
01:40:54,912 --> 01:40:57,472
Exploded on her eggs

2030
01:40:57,728 --> 01:40:58,240
Profession

2031
01:40:58,496 --> 01:41:04,128
I read some article and I believe I don't want to be quoted on this but as I recall it was

2032
01:41:04,384 --> 01:41:05,920
Towards the end of graduating from attic

2033
01:41:06,176 --> 01:41:08,480
School is when things started

2034
01:41:08,736 --> 01:41:11,040
Yeah I don't know I don't care as much

2035
01:41:11,296 --> 01:41:12,320
Cuz you if you want to write a biography

2036
01:41:13,344 --> 01:41:17,696
All I care if you ever read an unquiet mind

2037
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:20,768
Interesting story

2038
01:41:24,096 --> 01:41:25,632
What I'm concerned about is

2039
01:41:25,888 --> 01:41:27,168
She's being used as an

2040
01:41:31,008 --> 01:41:32,544
Typically about the things that Alex wants her

2041
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:34,848
Next

2042
01:41:35,104 --> 01:41:35,872
That's the most important

2043
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:38,944
One last clip that I believe is just

2044
01:41:40,992 --> 01:41:42,784
To this whole thing

2045
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:44,064
Clearly demonstrated

2046
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:44,832
Alex's

2047
01:41:46,624 --> 01:41:47,136
Truth

2048
01:41:47,392 --> 01:41:51,488
Using 911 blogger and Paul Joseph Watson misrepresentation

2049
01:41:52,768 --> 01:41:53,536
As if it were Maine

2050
01:41:53,792 --> 01:41:54,304
Stream news

2051
01:41:55,328 --> 01:41:55,840
Scare people

2052
01:41:56,096 --> 01:41:57,120
Into his world

2053
01:41:57,632 --> 01:41:58,144
Reinforces

2054
01:41:59,168 --> 01:42:00,960
And all this other b*******

2055
01:42:01,216 --> 01:42:01,728
Globalist

2056
01:42:02,752 --> 01:42:03,264
In

2057
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:04,288
Serviceable

2058
01:42:04,544 --> 01:42:05,824
He brings a medical doctor

2059
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:09,152
Pryor had her license revoked

2060
01:42:09,408 --> 01:42:10,944
For being delusional

2061
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:12,736
Narcissistic and having borderline

2062
01:42:12,992 --> 01:42:16,064
Publix

2063
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:18,624
To be allowed to practice medicine

2064
01:42:19,392 --> 01:42:19,904
Now

2065
01:42:20,160 --> 01:42:20,672
Here

2066
01:42:21,184 --> 01:42:21,696
Is happy End

2067
01:42:23,488 --> 01:42:26,816
People watching

2068
01:42:27,328 --> 01:42:28,608
Yes say it is a napping

2069
01:42:28,864 --> 01:42:30,400
Agreed agreed

2070
01:42:32,448 --> 01:42:36,288
Wow

2071
01:42:37,056 --> 01:42:38,336
You've done nothing Alex

2072
01:42:38,592 --> 01:42:39,616
This is so stupid

2073
01:42:46,784 --> 01:42:50,880
Well first off I'm still wrapped up in her

2074
01:42:51,392 --> 01:42:52,160
Which is the trash

2075
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:57,024
And also

2076
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:00,352
Anytime

2077
01:43:02,656 --> 01:43:03,424
Vistaril

2078
01:43:04,448 --> 01:43:07,008
Stop with I don't have

2079
01:43:11,616 --> 01:43:12,640
I don't know certain

2080
01:43:16,736 --> 01:43:19,552
You kicked ass I'm still on the lake

2081
01:43:19,808 --> 01:43:20,576
Holyshit

2082
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:22,368
This bad

2083
01:43:23,136 --> 01:43:27,488
Like I feel exactly the same way

2084
01:43:27,744 --> 01:43:28,256
I guess I'm dance

2085
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:33,632
I appreciate that

2086
01:43:34,144 --> 01:43:37,216
Because they're part of research that I can do

2087
01:43:37,984 --> 01:43:39,264
Like I can lay out the facts

2088
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:40,800
Space tomchek stories

2089
01:43:41,312 --> 01:43:41,824
Investigation

2090
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:43,360
All that stuff I can do that

2091
01:43:45,152 --> 01:43:46,688
Is tell you what Alex believe

2092
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:49,760
I can't right this is a manifestation of

2093
01:43:52,064 --> 01:43:56,160
No further I can't tell you when he wrote that are

2094
01:43:57,184 --> 01:43:59,232
I know he does

2095
01:43:59,488 --> 01:44:00,000
Absolutely

2096
01:44:00,256 --> 01:44:01,280
I don't know if

2097
01:44:01,536 --> 01:44:03,328
He believed that the 911 blogger

2098
01:44:03,584 --> 01:44:04,608
Is accurate

2099
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:06,656
I don't know if his editorial fan

2100
01:44:07,168 --> 01:44:08,960
Is there solo

2101
01:44:11,776 --> 01:44:13,056
He's trying to pull fast one

2102
01:44:13,312 --> 01:44:13,824
And knows that the

2103
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:15,104
Versus bad

2104
01:44:15,360 --> 01:44:16,896
But it reinforces my world

2105
01:44:18,176 --> 01:44:21,504
May I don't know I got a little cold too

2106
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:22,272
Because I

2107
01:44:22,528 --> 01:44:23,808
I would love to tell you

2108
01:44:24,064 --> 01:44:24,576
Alex

2109
01:44:25,856 --> 01:44:27,136
Right

2110
01:44:27,392 --> 01:44:28,672
We're on the stupid evil

2111
01:44:28,928 --> 01:44:29,952
Continue

2112
01:44:30,208 --> 01:44:31,744
But stupid is still a little

2113
01:44:32,512 --> 01:44:34,816
Incredibles

2114
01:44:35,072 --> 01:44:35,840
Absolutely

2115
01:44:36,096 --> 01:44:39,168
Yeah I agree with you all across the across-the-board there

2116
01:44:40,704 --> 01:44:41,472
Just fascinating

2117
01:44:42,752 --> 01:44:43,264
Well first off

2118
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:44,288
Just poodles

2119
01:44:45,568 --> 01:44:46,080
Other

2120
01:44:47,616 --> 01:44:49,664
I think you might have gotten married

2121
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:50,432
Recently

2122
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:53,504
It's not super in

2123
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:55,552
Their personal lives aren't really all that interested

2124
01:44:56,064 --> 01:44:59,904
I don't know if I've ever

2125
01:45:00,160 --> 01:45:00,672
Experience

2126
01:45:01,184 --> 01:45:02,464
Paul Joseph Watson

2127
01:45:02,976 --> 01:45:03,488
Good faith

2128
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:04,512
Yeah

2129
01:45:04,768 --> 01:45:08,096
Yo what if your entire life is built around

2130
01:45:08,864 --> 01:45:09,888
Behave bad

2131
01:45:10,144 --> 01:45:15,520
Serial killers

2132
01:45:15,776 --> 01:45:16,800
People

2133
01:45:17,056 --> 01:45:18,848
Can compartmentalize these really

2134
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:20,640
Parts of yourself

2135
01:45:20,896 --> 01:45:22,432
You know be normal already

2136
01:45:25,504 --> 01:45:31,648
I got pushed back on that just because you brought up Paul Joseph Watson's wife it's yours

2137
01:45:31,904 --> 01:45:32,416
Responsible to

2138
01:45:32,672 --> 01:45:36,512
Have a bad marriage

2139
01:45:37,024 --> 01:45:42,144
I'm not making you a great guy what is or is not

2140
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:42,912
I'm just saying

2141
01:45:43,424 --> 01:45:44,704
He's probably going to kill is

2142
01:45:48,544 --> 01:45:50,592
I do not stand behind you on that

2143
01:45:54,944 --> 01:45:56,480
Where is sloppiness

2144
01:45:56,736 --> 01:45:57,760
In reporting

2145
01:45:58,784 --> 01:45:59,552
Rick

2146
01:46:00,064 --> 01:46:00,576
Evil

2147
01:46:01,088 --> 01:46:04,928
Versus just being a

2148
01:46:05,184 --> 01:46:09,024
Being shity at your job I don't think it matters all that much

2149
01:46:09,536 --> 01:46:10,560
Cuz the effect is

2150
01:46:10,816 --> 01:46:11,584
The effect of prop

2151
01:46:12,096 --> 01:46:13,376
Right

2152
01:46:13,632 --> 01:46:14,144
Being sloppy

2153
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:16,448
Right the way you're using that sloppiness

2154
01:46:16,704 --> 01:46:17,472
Furthering

2155
01:46:17,728 --> 01:46:19,008
Evil propaganda

2156
01:46:19,264 --> 01:46:19,776
I'm so

2157
01:46:20,032 --> 01:46:20,800
We must judge

2158
01:46:21,056 --> 01:46:24,384
You based on that

2159
01:46:24,896 --> 01:46:25,408
Sorry

2160
01:46:25,664 --> 01:46:26,944
I'm sorry about that but

2161
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:30,784
Also we have a drink

2162
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:32,064
The benefit of the doubt

2163
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:36,416
Is not yours is it existed in the vacuum

2164
01:46:36,928 --> 01:46:43,072
Episode 200 something that's a pretty good idea that I was probably intentionally

2165
01:46:43,328 --> 01:46:43,840
Paul Joseph Watson

2166
01:46:44,096 --> 01:46:46,912
Probably

2167
01:46:47,168 --> 01:46:49,984
The bad source

2168
01:46:50,240 --> 01:46:51,264
Argument

2169
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:52,544
You be like all right

2170
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:53,568
You guys just

2171
01:46:54,080 --> 01:47:00,224
Just f***** up this about the Bloomberg article

2172
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:00,992
It happened

2173
01:47:01,248 --> 01:47:03,040
You listen to a spot like a

2174
01:47:03,296 --> 01:47:04,832
For biotech

2175
01:47:05,088 --> 01:47:06,880
And assumed that that was the reality

2176
01:47:07,904 --> 01:47:10,720
Textbooks obviously you're going to be Shifting the blame somewhere else

2177
01:47:10,976 --> 01:47:13,280
If you report based on an interview

2178
01:47:13,536 --> 01:47:14,304
Did Whitney

2179
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:15,072
Spokesperson

2180
01:47:15,328 --> 01:47:15,840
For biotech

2181
01:47:19,936 --> 01:47:25,056
Then yeah

2182
01:47:25,312 --> 01:47:28,640
You're not like you're not in on

2183
01:47:28,896 --> 01:47:31,200
The level of acceptable

2184
01:47:31,456 --> 01:47:31,968
Swap

2185
01:47:32,224 --> 01:47:32,992
You can do

2186
01:47:34,528 --> 01:47:35,552
Good Outlet

2187
01:47:36,064 --> 01:47:37,088
Respectable Outlets

2188
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:38,880
When they behave like that

2189
01:47:39,136 --> 01:47:39,904
Make every effort

2190
01:47:43,232 --> 01:47:44,256
Hopefully

2191
01:47:44,512 --> 01:47:47,072
Eli's world

2192
01:47:47,328 --> 01:47:48,608
Hopefully they do a better job

2193
01:47:48,864 --> 01:47:50,144
Five most of the time they still

2194
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:50,912
Directions

2195
01:47:53,472 --> 01:47:55,008
Sir they're very low on the

2196
01:47:57,568 --> 01:47:58,080
I just

2197
01:47:58,592 --> 01:47:59,104
And Alex's

2198
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:01,408
Moana

2199
01:48:01,664 --> 01:48:02,176
Malevolent

2200
01:48:02,688 --> 01:48:03,712
Yeah

2201
01:48:06,272 --> 01:48:08,064
Yeah

2202
01:48:13,696 --> 01:48:16,768
We're done now

2203
01:48:17,024 --> 01:48:19,328
Because

2204
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:20,864
I think I I think I meant

2205
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:22,144
Before we started recording

2206
01:48:23,168 --> 01:48:23,680
Researching

2207
01:48:23,936 --> 01:48:24,448
This was

2208
01:48:24,704 --> 01:48:28,032
Do you know deep the rollercoaster ride of The Source Trail

2209
01:48:28,544 --> 01:48:30,080
Getting to the check articles

2210
01:48:30,592 --> 01:48:31,616
Alex is wrong

2211
01:48:31,872 --> 01:48:33,152
They're reporting this wrong

2212
01:48:33,664 --> 01:48:36,992
And then a little bit later finding the Bloomberg article and being like wait

2213
01:48:37,248 --> 01:48:39,040
This is saying that Alex is right

2214
01:48:39,296 --> 01:48:40,320
Why didn't they use disorder

2215
01:48:40,832 --> 01:48:42,112
What's going on

2216
01:48:42,368 --> 01:48:44,160
And then finding the check investigation

2217
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:49,024
After they've already gone through all the details

2218
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:50,560
So the check articles we're right

2219
01:48:51,584 --> 01:48:52,096
The Bloomberg article

2220
01:48:52,352 --> 01:48:52,864
Taking out the inner

2221
01:48:53,376 --> 01:48:54,144
Alex is wrong

2222
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:55,168
But it was really

2223
01:48:56,192 --> 01:49:00,032
All the investigation of like the research that I've done this was the one that's like

2224
01:49:00,288 --> 01:49:02,592
Like it really spiraled around a lot more

2225
01:49:02,848 --> 01:49:03,872
Then other times

2226
01:49:04,640 --> 01:49:06,176
Most other ones have been much more.

2227
01:49:06,432 --> 01:49:12,576
Alex is wrong

2228
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:17,440
Close the case

2229
01:49:17,952 --> 01:49:24,096
Follow down the rabbit hole

2230
01:49:24,608 --> 01:49:26,912
I was just

2231
01:49:31,008 --> 01:49:31,520
Avian flu

2232
01:49:31,776 --> 01:49:32,288
That's true

2233
01:49:32,544 --> 01:49:36,896
All of them

2234
01:49:37,152 --> 01:49:39,456
So like a few thousand people

2235
01:49:40,224 --> 01:49:40,736
I like

2236
01:49:41,504 --> 01:49:42,784
Look look look at this real is

2237
01:49:45,088 --> 01:49:46,880
Bio weapon released

2238
01:49:47,136 --> 01:49:47,648
In the 10 years

2239
01:49:48,416 --> 01:49:49,184
9 years

2240
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:51,232
He did this episode

2241
01:49:53,024 --> 01:49:53,536
Zip different

2242
01:49:54,048 --> 01:49:54,560
Detox

2243
01:50:01,216 --> 01:50:06,592
That's not a pandemic related by didn't come to mine

2244
01:50:06,848 --> 01:50:07,872
Speaking of like

2245
01:50:08,128 --> 01:50:09,152
Disease

2246
01:50:09,664 --> 01:50:11,200
Stuff like that

2247
01:50:11,456 --> 01:50:12,736
Rudolph

2248
01:50:14,528 --> 01:50:16,320
Outbreak that happened

2249
01:50:16,576 --> 01:50:18,112
What was that a couple years ago

2250
01:50:18,368 --> 01:50:20,160
There were some text from there but

2251
01:50:20,416 --> 01:50:21,696
Amazing how well that was

2252
01:50:24,256 --> 01:50:25,536
It was contained as

2253
01:50:25,792 --> 01:50:26,816
Efficiently as it was

2254
01:50:27,328 --> 01:50:28,864
If the globalist were trying to

2255
01:50:29,120 --> 01:50:30,656
To cause some sort of the Bayou release

2256
01:50:31,936 --> 01:50:34,752
Ebola outbreak would have benefits

2257
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:36,544
Yeah so

2258
01:50:39,104 --> 01:50:41,664
Fausto f****** flat

2259
01:50:42,176 --> 01:50:44,736
Nefarious world power that wants

2260
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:50,112
And it seems like if you were going to

2261
01:50:50,368 --> 01:50:50,880
To do it

2262
01:50:52,160 --> 01:50:55,488
Extent to which you would do would have to then

2263
01:50:57,280 --> 01:51:00,864
So overwhelming

2264
01:51:01,120 --> 01:51:01,888
People who are at

2265
01:51:02,144 --> 01:51:02,656
Acting in good faith

2266
01:51:03,168 --> 01:51:04,704
Trying to avoid

2267
01:51:05,728 --> 01:51:07,520
Would have to be overpowered in

2268
01:51:09,568 --> 01:51:10,336
Creative

2269
01:51:10,592 --> 01:51:12,384
But when that Ebola outbreak

2270
01:51:12,640 --> 01:51:13,152
Happened

2271
01:51:13,408 --> 01:51:16,480
You would have done little things in your power to make sure it's

2272
01:51:18,272 --> 01:51:21,088
You would have taken that as an opportunity to do the things

2273
01:51:21,344 --> 01:51:24,672
Alex is desperately wanted

2274
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:26,208
Hazel to me

2275
01:51:26,720 --> 01:51:27,232
All of this

2276
01:51:27,488 --> 01:51:28,000
Seems like bulshit

2277
01:51:28,512 --> 01:51:29,536
All of it just seems like

2278
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:31,072
Fear

2279
01:51:31,328 --> 01:51:31,840
Spell check

2280
01:51:32,352 --> 01:51:34,144
And to get people more deeply

2281
01:51:34,656 --> 01:51:35,168
Entrenched

2282
01:51:35,424 --> 01:51:36,192
What's it called

2283
01:51:36,448 --> 01:51:37,216
9 years later

2284
01:51:37,472 --> 01:51:39,776
Use as a multi-level marketing

2285
01:51:40,032 --> 01:51:46,176
Introduction man I don't want to live in the present anyway

2286
01:51:50,016 --> 01:51:56,160
And it's really funny of it like sort of we know where this all is going because of that

2287
01:51:56,416 --> 01:51:59,488
Funny to look at the pics

2288
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:01,024
With the framework of

2289
01:52:01,536 --> 01:52:02,304
We know where this leads

2290
01:52:03,584 --> 01:52:05,632
Savon

2291
01:52:05,888 --> 01:52:11,008

2292
01:52:11,264 --> 01:52:12,544
Scammers

2293
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:14,848

And all that

2298
01:52:20,736 --> 01:52:21,248
He had his

2299
01:52:21,504 --> 01:52:23,552
Moment in the sun like Icarus

2300
01:52:23,808 --> 01:52:26,880
He flew far too close and now he's stuck inside

2301
01:52:27,136 --> 01:52:27,904

The other one

It's further

2338
01:54:32,832 --> 01:54:34,880
You have to do nothing for so

2339
01:54:35,392 --> 01:54:36,416
Your sort of should be

2340
01:54:36,672 --> 01:54:39,744
Conflicted

A die

2343

Feel like there's

2344
01:54:48,448 --> 01:54:52,032
Look beyond beyond the multi-level marketing scheme there's like some

2345
01:54:52,288 --> 01:54:52,800
Thing that you should

2346
01:54:53,056 --> 01:54:55,616
Remember about

2347
01:54:55,872 --> 01:54:56,896

01:54:59,968 --> 01:55:00,992
A bit but there's one

2350
01:55:03,808 --> 01:55:07,648
